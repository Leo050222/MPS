    {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Please compare the following answers with the correct answers and determine if each answer is correct (equivalent).\n\n        []\n\n        IMPORTANT: After your analysis, you MUST provide your judgment in the following JSON format (no additional text before or after the JSON):\n\n        {\n            "correctness": [
                true/false for Answer 1,
                true/false for Answer 2, ...
            ]\n
        }\n\n        Rules for judgment:\n        1. The JSON must be valid and properly formatted\n        2. Compare each answer pair carefully - they should be considered correct if they are mathematically or logically equivalent\n        3. Ignore minor formatting differences (spaces, capitalization, etc.) unless they affect the meaning\n        4. For numerical answers, consider them equivalent if they represent the same value (e.g.,
        "42" and "42.0" are equivalent)\n        5. For text answers, consider them equivalent if they convey the same meaning\n        6. Return true only if the answers are truly equivalent,
        false otherwise\n        7. The correctness list should have the same length as the number of answer pairs\n        8. The JSON block should be the last part of your response\n        9. Compare the answers and truths in the order of the combination list and return the correctness list in the same order\n\n        Example format (for 1 answer):\n        {\n            "correctness": [
                true
            ]\n
        }\n\n        or (for 2 answers):\n        {\n            "correctness": [
                true,
                false
            ]\n
