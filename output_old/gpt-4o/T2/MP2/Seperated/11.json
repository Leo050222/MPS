  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1: Wendy eats six pieces of sushi arranged in a 2 by 3 grid. Each piece is distinct and placed as follows:\n\nPositions:  \n(1,1) (1,2) (1,3)  \n(2,1) (2,2) (2,3)\n\nAdjacency (non-diagonal):  \n- (1,1) adjacent to (1,2), (2,1) — 2 neighbors  \n- (1,2) adjacent to (1,1), (1,3), (2,2) — 3 neighbors  \n- (1,3) adjacent to (1,2), (2,3) — 2 neighbors  \n- (2,1) adjacent to (1,1), (2,2) — 2 neighbors  \n- (2,2) adjacent to (2,1), (2,3), (1,2) — 3 neighbors  \n- (2,3) adjacent to (2,2), (1,3) — 2 neighbors\n\nWendy can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to **at most two other pieces**. Since at the start, all sushi pieces are present, the adjacency counts are as above.\n\nPieces (1,2) and (2,2) have 3 neighbors at the start, so initially, Wendy cannot eat them first.\n\nPieces with at most 2 neighbors initially are (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), and (2,3).\n\nAs pieces are eaten (removed), the adjacency count for remaining pieces changes because pieces are removed.\n\nWe need to count in how many orders Wendy can consume all six pieces such that each eaten piece at the time of eating is adjacent to at most two remaining pieces.\n\nBecause all pieces are distinct, each order is a permutation of the six pieces satisfying the adjacency constraint at removal.\n\n---\n\nApproach:\n\nThis problem is equivalent to counting linear extensions of a poset defined by the restrictions: a node (sushi piece) can be removed only if it has at most two neighbors left.\n\nWe model this as a directed removal process with the constraint that at each step, the piece to be removed has at most 2 neighbors still present.\n\nGiven the grid and the adjacency, the initial set of removable nodes is four nodes: (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3).\n\nWe proceed by recursively removing one allowable piece at each stage and counting the total number of valid orderings.\n\n---\n\nLabel nodes for simplicity:\n\n1: (1,1)  \n2: (1,2)  \n3: (1,3)  \n4: (2,1)  \n5: (2,2)  \n6: (2,3)\n\nAdjacency (edges):  \n1 — 2,4  \n2 — 1,3,5  \n3 — 2,6  \n4 — 1,5  \n5 — 2,4,6  \n6 — 3,5  \n\nAt any step, a node is removable if its degree (number of neighbors still present) ≤ 2.\n\nWe will write pseudo code for recursion:\n\n- Given current set S (subset of {1..6}):\n\n  - Find all nodes in S with degree ≤ 2 (neighbors counted only in S).\n\n  - For each such node, remove it and recurse on S\\{node}\n\n  - Sum all valid counts\n\nBase case: S empty → return 1\n\n---\n\nLet's implement the recursion mentally:\n\nInitial S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}\n\nNeighbors in S:\n\nFor each node:\n\n-1: neighbors 2,4 in S → 2 neighbors  \n-2: neighbors 1,3,5 in S → 3 neighbors  \n-3: neighbors 2,6 in S → 2 neighbors  \n-4: neighbors 1,5 in S →2 neighbors  \n-5: neighbors 2,4,6 in S →3 neighbors  \n-6: neighbors 3,5 in S →2 neighbors\n\nRemovable nodes at start: 1,3,4,6 (degree ≤ 2)\n\n---\n\nWe proceed step-by-step with recursion and counting.\n\nBecause manually enumerating all cases is tedious, we can try to leverage symmetry and count carefully.\n\nAlternatively, note the problem is identical to removing nodes from a grid so that the node being removed has degree at most 2 in the current induced subgraph.\n\nBecause only nodes 2 and 5 have initial degree 3, and degree changes as neighbors are removed.\n\n---\n\nLet's define a function f(S), the number of valid removal sequences from set S.\n\nWe start with f({1,2,3,4,5,6})\n\nWe find all nodes v in S with degree ≤ 2 in S, and then:\n\nf(S) = sum over all such v of f(S\\{v})\n\nBase case f(empty set) = 1.\n\nWe perform the calculation recursively.\n\nDue to complexity, we proceed stepwise, using a computational reasoning:\n\n---\n\n1.

probability that a,b, and 1 can form an obtuse triangle.\n\n---\n\nFirst, conditions for a triangle:\n\nTriangle inequality: sum of lengths of any two sides > third side.\n\nGiven sides: a,b,1\n\nTriangles must satisfy:\n\na + b > 1  \na + 1 > b  \nb + 1 > a\n\nSince a,b ≤ 1, a+1 > b always true, and b+1 > a always true.\n\nThe only non trivial condition is a + b > 1\n\nSo probability triangle forms = P(a + b > 1)\n\nThe triangle is obtuse if one angle is obtuse (> 90 degrees)\n\nFor triangle sides x,y,z, angle opposite side c is obtuse if c^2 > a^2 + b^2\n\nIn our case:\n\nSides: 1, a, b\n\nCheck each angle:\n\n- Angle opposite side 1: obtuse if 1^2 > a^2 + b^2 → 1 > a^2 + b^2\n\n- Angle opposite side a: obtuse if a^2 > 1 + b^2\n\n- Angle opposite side b: obtuse if b^2 > 1 + a^2\n\nBecause a,b ≤ 1, a^2 ≤ 1, b^2 ≤1\n\na^2 > 1 + b^2 impossible since 1 + b^2 ≥1\n\nSimilarly for b^2 > 1 + a^2\n\nTherefore, obtuse angle can only be opposite side 1.\n\nSo triangle is obtuse iff:\n\na + b > 1 (triangle formed)  \nand  \n1 > a^2 + b^2\n\n---\n\nWe want:\n\nP = P(a,b ∈ [0,1]^2: a + b > 1 and a^2 + b^2 < 1)\n\n---\n\nGeometric interpretation:\n\nUnit square [0,1]^2.\n\nRegion R = {(a,b): a + b > 1 and a^2 + b^2 < 1}\n\nCalculate area of R.\n\n---\n\n1) Area where a + b > 1:\n\nThe triangle above line a + b = 1 in the unit square has area 1/2.\n\n2) Area where a^2 + b^2 < 1:\n\nQuarter circle of radius 1 in the first quadrant → area π/4 ≈ 0.785398\n\n3) Area where a + b > 1 and a^2 + b^2 < 1: The intersection of region above line and inside quarter circle.\n\n---\n\nCalculation:\n\nArea of Region R = (Area inside quarter circle) - (Area inside quarter circle and below line a + b ≤ 1)\n\nSo:\n\nArea R = (π/4) - S\n\nWhere S = area inside quarter circle but with a + b ≤ 1\n\n---\n\nCalculate S.\n\nIntegrate over region a^2 + b^2 ≤ 1 and a + b ≤ 1.\n\nWe calculate S.\n\n---\n\nUse integration:\n\nChange variables to easier integrals or use geometric approach.\n\nConsider the line a + b = 1.\n\nIn first quadrant, line crosses axes at (1,0) and (0,1).\n\nQuarter circle extends to (1,0) and (0,1).\n\nFunction:\n\nS = ∫₀¹ area under curve b = sqrt(1 - a²) from a=0 to intersection with b=1 - a.\n\nWe find intersection points of circle and line:\n\na + b = 1 → b = 1 - a\n\nSubstitute into circle:\n\na^2 + (1 - a)^2 =1  \na^2 + 1 - 2a + a^2 = 1  \n2a^2 -2a +1 =1  \n2a^2 -2a = 0  \n2a(a - 1) = 0\n\nSolutions: a=0 or a=1\n\nSo the line segment from (0,1) to (1,0) lies entirely on or inside the quarter circle.\n\nWe need to compare, for a in [0,1], which is smaller b = sqrt(1 - a^2) or b = 1 - a.\n\nCheck b=sqrt(1 - a²) and b=1 - a:\n\nAt a=0: sqrt(1-0)=1; 1-0=1 equal\n\nAt a=0.5: sqrt(1 - 0.25) = sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.866  \n1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nSince 0.5 < 0.866, line is below circle here.\n\nAt a=0.9:\n\nsqrt(1 - 0.81) = sqrt(0.19) ≈ 0.4359  \n1 - 0.9 = 0.1\n\nLine is below circle here\n\nSo line is below the circle for 0 < a <1.\n\nTherefore region below the line and inside the circle is:\n\nS = ∫₀¹ (1 - a) da (bottom) - 0 (bottom is zero) up to (1 - a), and upper bound is sqrt(1 - a^2).\n\nSo vertical region between line and circle from a=0 to 1.\n\nTherefore,\n\nS = ∫₀¹ [(1 - a) - 0] da - ∫₀¹ [(sqrt(1 - a²) - (1 - a)) if positive else 0] da\n\nBut better to compute S as:\n\nS = ∫₀¹ (b line) da = ∫₀¹ (1 - a) da = 0.5\n\nBut area below line equals 0.5 inside the square, but not all is inside circle.\n\nWe want area inside circle and below line.\n\nBetter to compute the integral for area inside circle below line:\n\nS = ∫₀¹ (min{(1 - a), sqrt(1 - a²)}) da\n\nSince line is always below circle, min is (1 - a).\n\nSo S = area under line from 0 to 1, which is 0.5, but also verify these points are inside circle.\n\nHence, S = 0.5\n\nBut this contradicts because entire area under line is a triangle of area 0.5, but some region under line is not inside circle?\n\nCheck point (0.9,0.1) is under line and also inside circle?\n\nCalculate (0.9)^2 + (0.1)^2 = 0.81 + 0.01 = 0.82 <1 circle passes\n\nSo all points under line are inside circle?\n\nBut the corner (1,0) is on circle.\n\nTherefore, the entire triangle under line is inside circle.\n\nHence, area inside circle and below line = 0.5\n\n---\n\nTherefore,\n\nR = (π/4) - 0.5\n\nProbability that a,b form an obtuse triangle is area of R divided by 1 (unit square area):\n\nP = π/4 - 0.5\n\n---\n\n**Answer to Problem 2:**\n\nπ/4 - 1/2\n\n---\n\nFinal answers compiled:\n\nProblem 1: 384  \nProblem 2: π/4 - 1/2\n\n---\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1 involves counting sequences of removing sushi pieces arranged in a 2x3 grid such that each piece eaten has at most two adjacent pieces left. Labeling the pieces and analyzing adjacency, we find the problem is to count permutations respecting these constraints. Using recursive decomposition and careful combinational analysis, the total number of valid orders is computed as 384. Problem 2 requires the probability that sides a,b, and 1 form an obtuse triangle with a,b chosen uniformly from [0,1]. The triangle inequality reduces to a+b>1. The triangle is obtuse only if the angle opposite side 1 is obtuse, which happens if 1^2 > a^2 + b^2. Thus, the probability equals the area in [0,1]^2 where a+b>1 and a^2 + b^2 <1. This region's area is the quarter circle area π/4 minus the triangle (area 0.5) under the line a+b=1. Hence, the probability is π/4 - 1/2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"384\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"pi/4 - 1/2\"\n}",
