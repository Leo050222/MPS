  "math_problem": "Wendy eats sushi for lunch. She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, labeled as follows:\n\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} A & B & C \\\\ D & E & F \\\\ \\end{array}$\n\nwhere pieces are adjacent if they share a side (not counting diagonally), with adjacencies $A$-$B$, $A$-$D$, $B$-$C$, $B$-$E$, $C$-$F$, $D$-$E$, $E$-$F$. The pieces of sushi are distinguishable. She can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other remaining pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row. Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers randomly (and independently) chosen from the range $[0,1]$. Find the probability that $a$, $b$ and $k$ form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Understanding the graph and degrees\\nWe have a 2x3 grid of pieces labeled as:\\nA B C\\nD E F\\n\\nAdjacencies are given as:\\nA-B, A-D, B-C, B-E, C-F, D-E, E-F\\n\\nStep 2: Identify the two endpoint pieces of the top row.\\nThe top row is A, B, C. The endpoints are A and C.\\n\\nStep 3: Remove A and C from the graph.\\nRemaining pieces: B, D, E, F\\n\\nStep 4: Find the induced subgraph on B, D, E, F and find the degree of F.\\nEdges involving these nodes are:\\n- B-E (both remaining)\\n- B-C (C removed) -> no\\n- C-F (C removed) -> no\\n- D-E (both remaining)\\n- E-F (both remaining)\\n\\nSo the edges in the induced subgraph are:\\nB-E, D-E, E-F\\n\\nStep 5: Calculate degree of F in this subgraph.\\nF is adjacent to E only, so degree of F is 1.\\n\\nStep 6: Define k = deg(F) + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1.\\n\\nStep 7: Now, a and b are independently and uniformly chosen from [0,1].\\nWe want the probability that a, b, and k=1 form an obtuse triangle.\\n\\nStep 8: Triangle side lengths are (a, b, 1).\\nSince a,b in [0,1], and k=1.\\n\\nStep 9: Conditions for triangle formation:\\nTriangle inequality must hold:\\n- a + b > 1\\n- a + 1 > b\\n- b + 1 > a\\n\\nSince a,b ≤ 1, a+1> b and b+1>a always hold.\\nOnly a+b > 1 is nontrivial.\\nSo, triangle exists iff a + b > 1.\\n\\nStep 10: When does the triangle become obtuse?\\nAn obtuse triangle has one angle > 90°, i.e., the square of the longest side > sum of squares of other two sides.\\n\\nHere, sides are (a, b, 1).\\nLongest side can be either 1 or max(a,b).\\nBut since a,b ≤ 1, 1 is the longest side or tied.\\n\\nCheck if largest side is 1:\\nCheck if 1² > a² + b² → 1 > a² + b².\\nIf true, triangle is obtuse.\\n\\nBut triangle only exists when a + b > 1.\\n\\nNote:\\nIf max(a,b) = 1 (possible if a=1 or b=1), then longest side is 1.\\nOtherwise (max(a,b) < 1), then longest side is 1.\\nSince a,b ≤1, longest side is always 1 or equal to one of the a or b.\\nActually, the largest side is 1 since a,b ≤ 1.\\n\\nStep 11: So obtuse triangle condition is:\\n1 > a² + b²\\n\\nStep 12: We want probability that:\\n- a,b ∈ [0,1]\\n- a + b > 1 (triangle inequality)\\n- a² + b² < 1 (obtuse condition with longest side 1)\\n\\nStep 13: Probability = area of {(a,b) ∈ [0,1]^2 | a+b >1 and a²+b² <1 }\\n\\nStep 14: Visualize unit square [0,1]x[0,1] with two regions:\\n- a+b > 1 is the upper-right triangle in the unit square above the line a+b=1\\n- a² + b² < 1 is the interior of quarter circle of radius 1 centered at origin.\\n\\nStep 15: We want the area of intersection:\\nInside unit square,\\nabove line a+b=1,\\nand inside circle a² + b² <1.\\n\\nStep 16: Bounds:\\nSince a+b>1, b > 1 - a.\\nFor each a in (0,1), b runs from max(1 - a, 0) up to 1\\nBut must also satisfy a² + b² <1 i.e., b < sqrt(1 - a²)\\n\\nSo, for each a in [0,1], the feasible b-range is: b in (max(1 - a, 0), min(1, sqrt(1 - a²)))\\nIf max(1 - a,0) < min(1, sqrt(1 - a²))\\n\\nStep 17: Find the integration limits:\\nFor which a is the interval non-empty?\\nLet's check at which a, 1 - a < sqrt(1 - a²)\\nOr (1 - a)² < 1 - a²\\n1 - 2a + a² < 1 - a²\\n1 - 2a + a² < 1 - a²\\nCancel 1 on both sides:\\n-2a + a² < -a²\\nAdd 2a to both sides:\\na² < -a² + 2a\\nAdd a² to both sides:\\n2a² < 2a\\nDivide by 2:\\na² < a\\nSince a≥0, this gives a <1\\nSo for all a in (0,1), (1 - a) < sqrt(1 - a²) holds.\\n\\nBecause for all a in (0,1), (1 - a) < sqrt(1 - a²), the feasible b interval is:\\nFrom b = 1 - a up to b = sqrt(1 - a²)\\n\\nWe must check for which a, sqrt(1 - a²) ≤ 1.\\nAlways true because sqrt(1 - a²) ≤1.\\n\\nStep 18: Integral setup:\\nProbability = ∫_0^1 [ sqrt(1 - a²) - (1 - a) ] da\\n\\nStep 19: Compute the integral:\\nP = ∫_0^1 sqrt(1 - a²) da - ∫_0^1 (1 - a) da\\n\\nStep 20: Compute each part:\\n1) ∫_0^1 sqrt(1 - a²) da\\nThis is quarter circle area of radius 1:\\nArea of quarter circle = π/4\\nBut this is integral of the function, not total area.\\nActually, ∫_0^1 sqrt(1 - x²) dx = (π/4)\\n\\n2) ∫_0^1 (1 - a) da = [a - a²/2]_0^1 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\\n\\nSo probability = π/4 - 1/2\\n\\nStep 21: Since a and b are uniform in unit square of area 1, this is exact probability.\\n\\nFinal answer: π/4 - 1/2\",\n    \"answer\": \"pi/4 - 1/2\"\n}",
