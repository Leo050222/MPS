After 80 balls are moved from Box $A$ to Box $B$, the ratio of balls in Box $A$ to Box $B$ is now $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1$. Find $100p+q$. Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio. Let $T$ be a trapezoid with two right angles and side lengths $4,4,5$, and $\\sqrt{17}$. Two line segments are drawn, connecting the midpoints of opposite sides of $T$ and dividing $T$ into $k$ regions. If the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest of these regions is $d$, compute $240 d$.",

(-1) = 4\\n\\nPoints:\\nD1 = (4,-1)\\nD2 = (-1,4)\\n\\nStep 21: Check which point forms trapezoid with sides 4,4,5,\\\\(\\\\sqrt{17}\\\\) with two right angles.\\n\\nThe point D(4,-1):\\nCheck length DA:\\nA(0,0) to D(4,-1): sqrt(4^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 +1) = sqrt(17)\\nCD:\\nC(4,4) to D(4,-1): sqrt(0^2 + (4 - (-1))^2) = sqrt(5^2) =5\\n\\nThis matches side lengths.\\n\\nTherefore D=(4, -1) is correct.\\n\\nStep 22: Coordinates of trapezoid T:\\nA(0,0), B(4,0), C(4,4), D(4,-1)\\n\\nNotice D and C have same x-coordinate 4.\\n\\nStep 23: Check the ordering of vertices for proper polygon.\\nPolygon: A(0,0) → B(4,0) → C(4,4) → D(4,-1) → back to A.\\n\\nThis polygon may be self-intersecting if vertices out of order.\\n\\nTry ordering:\\nA(0,0), B(4,0), D(4,-1), C(4,4)\\n\\nBut in polygon, sides must be defined as consecutive vertices.\\n\\nGiven sides are 4,4,5,\\\\sqrt{17}, the 4s are AB and BC.\\n\\nTo have trapezoid with two right angles at A and B, define trapezoid as A->B->C->D->A with:\\nA(0,0), B(4,0), C(4,4), D(0,h) unknown\\n\\nStep 24: Let's use D(0,y) and find y such that sides are 4,4,5, \\\\sqrt{17}\\\\.\\n\\nSides:\\nAB = length between (0,0) and (4,0) =4 (good)\\nBC = length between (4,0) and (4,4) =4 (good)\\nCD = length between (4,4) and (0,y) = sqrt((4-0)^2 + (4 - y)^2) = sqrt(16 + (4 - y)^2)\\nDA = length between (0,y) and (0,0) = |y - 0| = |y|\\n\\nSides left are 5 and \\\\(\\\\sqrt{17}\\\\)\\nTry DA=5, CD=\\\\sqrt{17}, or vice versa.\\n\\nOption 1:\\nDA=5 → |y|=5 → y = -5 or 5\\nCD= sqrt(16 + (4 - y)^2) = sqrt(16 + (4 \\n- 5)^2 )= sqrt(16 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 +1) = \\\\sqrt{17}\\\\ if y=5\\n\\nCheck y=5:\\nDA=5 correct\\nCD= sqrt(16 + (4-5)^2) = sqrt(16 +1) =\\\\(\\\\sqrt{17}\\\\) correct\\n\\nSo D=(0,5)\\n\\nStep 25: Verify trapezoid with vertices:\\nA(0,0), B(4,0), C(4,4), D(0,5)\\nStep 26: The trapezoid has two right angles at A and B (at (0,0) and (4,0))\\n\\nStep 27: Compute area of T:\\n\\nArea of trapezoid = \\\\( \\\\frac{(sum of parallel sides)}{2} \\\\times height \\\\)\\n\\nIdentify parallel sides:\\nAB (4), CD (distance between (4,4) and (0,5))\\nLength CD = sqrt((4-0)^2 + (4-5)^2) = sqrt(16+1) = \\\\sqrt{17}\\\\\\n\\nHeight = distance between AB and CD along y-axis:\\nAB at y=0\\nCD points at y=4 and y=5, so height is approximately average of 4 and 5 - 0\\nBut trapezoid is right angled at A and B, so sides AB and DC are the bases.\\n\\nHeight is vertical distance between AB and CD which is approximately y=4 (for C) and y=5 (for D)\\n\\nAnother approach: consider height = length BC = 4 (since BC is perpendicular to AB)\\n\\nArea = \\\\(\\\\frac{(AB + CD)}{2} \\\\times length BC = \\\\frac{4 + \\\\sqrt{17}}{2} \\\\times 4 = 2(4 + \\\\sqrt{17}) = 8 + 2\\\\sqrt{17}\\\\).\\n\\nStep 28: Now, we draw two line segments connecting midpoints of opposite sides.\\nOpposite sides:\\n- AB opposite CD\\n- BC opposite DA\\n\\nFind midpoints:\\n- Midpoint of AB: M_AB = ((0 + 4)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (2,0)\\n- Midpoint of CD: M_CD = ((4 + 0)/2, (4 + 5)/2) = (2,4.5)\\n\\n- Midpoint of BC: M_BC = ((4 +4)/2, (0 +4)/2) = (4,2)\\n- Midpoint of DA: M_DA = ((0 +0)/2, (5 + 0)/2) = (0, 2.5)\\n\\nStep 29: Draw segment1: M_AB to M_CD: from (2,0) to (2,4.5)\\nSegment2: M_BC to M_DA: from (4,2) to (0,2.5)\\n\\nStep 30: These two segments will intersect. Let's find the point of intersection.\\n\\nStep 31: Parameterize the segments:\\nSegment1 vertical line at x=2 from y=0 to y=4.5\\nSegment2 from (4,2) to (0,2.5)\\n\\nParametric form of segment2:\\nS2(t) = (4 - 4t, 2 + 0.5t) for t in [0,1]\\n\\nAt intersection with x=2:\\n4 - 4t = 2 → 4t=2 → t=0.5\\n\\nAt t=0.5,\\ny=2 + 0.5*0.5 = 2 + 0.25 = 2.25\\n\\nSo intersection point I is at (2, 2.25)\\n\\nStep 32: The two segments divide T into k regions.\\nWe previously set k = g + 3\\n\\nStep 33: Need to find g = gcd(n - 160, 480) where n is the answer.\\n\\nStep 34: Now, the two segments divide the trapezoid into how many regions?\\n\\nFrom geometry, connecting midpoints of opposite sides of a quadrilateral with two segments divides the polygon into 4 regions if the segments intersect inside.\\n\\nBut in problem, the number of regions is k, defined as g + 3.\\n\\nSince k ≥ 4, then g + 3 = 4 → g =1\\n\\nStep 35: Find n so that gcd(n - 160, 480) = 1\\n\\nTry n = 161 → gcd(161 - 160, 480) = gcd(1,480) =1\\n\\nTherefore, n=161\\n\\nStep 36: Now k = g + 3 = 1 + 3 =4\\nNumber of regions after drawing segments is 4.\\n\\nStep 37: Now compute difference d between largest and smallest areas among these 4 regions.\\n\\nStep 38: Calculate areas of 4 regions cut by these two lines:\\n\\n- The trapezoid is divided by the vertical line x=2 (segment M_AB to M_CD) into left & right parts.\\n- Then divided by the segment from (4,2) to (0,2.5) diagonally.\\n\\nStep 39: Calculate total area again:\\nTotal Area = 8 + 2√17\\n\\nStep 40: The vertical segment splits the trapezoid into two parts:\\nLeft part: from x=0 to x=2\\nRight part: from x=2 to x=4\\n\\nStep 41: Equation of top and bottom lines to find areas.\\n\\nBottom edge: AB from (0,0) to (4,0) → y=0\\n\\nTop edge: CD from (0,5) to (4,4)\\nEquation of line CD:\\nSlope m = (4 - 5) / (4 - 0) = -1/4\\nEquation: y -5 = -1/4 (x -0) → y = 5 - x/4\\n\\nStep 42: For 0 ≤ x ≤ 4,\\nTop y = 5 - x/4\\nBottom y=0\\n\\nStep 43: Left part (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) area:\\nIntegrate (top - bottom) dx from 0 to 2:\\nArea_left = ∫₀² (5 - x/4) dx = [5x - x^2/8]₀² = (5*2 - 4/8) - 0 = 10 - 0.5 = 9.5\\n\\nRight part (2 ≤ x ≤ 4) area:\\nArea_right = Total area - Area_left = (8 + 2√17) - 9.5 = ( -1.5 + 2√17 )\\n\\nStep 44: Now, segment from (4,2) to (0,2.5) divides each side into two regions.\\n\\nEquation of segment:\\nFrom (4,2) to (0,2.5): slope m = (2.5 - 2) / (0 - 4) = 0.5 / -4 = -1/8\\nEquation:\\ny - 2 = -1/8 (x - 4)\\n=> y = 2 - (1/8)x + 0.5 = 2.5 - (1/8)x\\n\\nStep 45: For a point (x,y), to be above this line:\\ny > 2.5 - (1/8)x\\nTo be below:\\ny < 2.5 - (1/8)x\\n\\nStep 46: The line splits the trapezoid. To find areas of the 4 regions, split the left and right halves using this line.\\n\\nStep 47: Left half (0 ≤ x ≤ 2):\\nTop line: y = 5 - x/4\\nBottom line: y =0\\n\\nThe segment line at x values:\\nAt x=0: y=2.5\\nAt x=2: y=2.5 - (1/8)*2 = 2.5 - 0.25=2.25\\n\\nStep 48: Left half is between y=0 and y=5 - x/4, and divided at y = 2.5 - (1/8) x.\\n\\nSo left half divides into two regions:\\n- Region 1 (above segment line): area between y = 2.5 - (1/8) x and y = 5 - x/4\\n- Region 2 (below segment line): area between y=0 and y = 2.5 - (1/8) x\\n\\nCalculate areas for x in [0,2]:\\n\\nArea_1_left = ∫₀² [(5 - x/4) - (2.5 - x/8)] dx = ∫₀² [5 - x/4 - 2.5 + x/8] dx = ∫₀² [2.5 - x/8] dx\\nArea_1_left = [2.5 x - x^2/16]₀² = (5 - 4/16) = 5 - 0.25=4.75\\n\\nArea_2_left = ∫₀² [(2.5 - x/8) - 0] dx = ∫₀² (2.5 - x/8) dx = [2.5 x - x^2/16]₀² = 5 - 0.25=4.75\\n\\nSo left half is divided into two equal areas 4.75 each.\\n\\nStep 49: Similarly, right half (2 ≤ x ≤ 4):\\nTop y = 5 - x/4\\nBottom y = 0\\n\\nSegment line:\\ny = 2.5 - (1/8) x\\nAt x=2: y=2.25\\nAt x=4: y=2.5 - (1/8)*4= 2.5 - 0.5=2.0\\n\\nStep 50: Right half divides into:\\n- Region above segment line: between y = 2.5 - (1/8) x and y = 5 - x/4\\n- Region below segment line: between y = 0 and y= 2.5 - (1/8) x\\n\\nCalculate the areas over x in [2,4]:\\n\\nArea_1_right = ∫₂⁴ [(5 - x/4) - (2.5 - x/8)] dx = ∫₂⁴ [2.5 - x/8] dx\\nCalculate:\\n∫ [2.5 dx] - ∫[x/8 dx] = 2.5 (4-2) - (1/8) * (x^2/2) evaluated from 2 to 4\\n\\nFirst term:\\n2.5 * (4-2) = 2.5 * 2 = 5\\nSecond term:\\n(1/8) * [ (4^2)/2 - (2^2)/2 ] = (1/8) * ( (16/2) - (4/2) ) = (1/8) * (8 - 2) = (1/8) * 6 = 0.75\\n\\nArea_1_right = 5 - 0.75 = 4.25\\n\\nArea_2_right = ∫₂⁴ [(2.5 - x/8) - 0] dx = same calculation:\\n∫ 2.5 dx - ∫ x/8 dx = 5 - 0.75 = 4.25\\n\\nStep 51: So right half areas are 4.25 each.\\n\\nStep 52: The 4 regions' areas are:\\n\\nR1: Left half above segment line = 4.75\\nR2: Left half below segment line =4.75\\nR3: Right half above segment line =4.25\\nR4: Right half below segment line =4.25\\n\\nStep 53: Find difference d between largest and smallest area:\\n\\nLargest =4.75\\nSmallest =4.25\\nDifference d = 4.75 - 4.25 = 0.5\\n\\nStep 54: Final step: compute 240 d = 240 * 0.5 = 120\\n\\nFinal answer: 120\\n\\nStep 55: Check value of g:\\nFrom n=161, g = gcd(161 - 160, 480) = gcd(1,480) =1\\n\\nk = g + 3 = 1 + 3 =4\\nThis matches the number of regions verified.\\n\\nEverything is consistent.\\n\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"answer\\\": \\\"120\\\"\\n}\"\n}",
