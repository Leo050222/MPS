  "math_problem": "$a$ and $b$ are integers such that $a+\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{15+\\sqrt{216}}$. Compute $a / b$. Instead of computing the ratio of the integer coefficient to the radicand in the denested form of the nested radical, simply find $k = a + 3$, where $a$ is the integer coefficient in that denested form. Mark has a cursed $k$-sided die that never rolls the same number twice in a row, and all other outcomes are equally likely. Compute the expected number of rolls it takes for Mark to roll every number at least once.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Denest the nested radical\\nWe are given:\\n\\n  a + sqrt(b) = sqrt(15 + sqrt(216))\\n\\nWe want integers a and b such that:\\n\\n  a + sqrt(b) = sqrt(15 + sqrt(216))\\n\\nSquaring both sides:\\n\\n  (a + sqrt(b))^2 = 15 + sqrt(216)\\n\\nLeft side:\\n\\n  a^2 + 2a sqrt(b) + b = 15 + sqrt(216)\\n\\nEquate rational and irrational parts:\\n\\n  Rational parts: a^2 + b = 15\\n  Irrational parts: 2a sqrt(b) = sqrt(216)\\n\\nSince sqrt(216) = sqrt(36*6) = 6 sqrt(6),\\n\\nFrom the irrational part:\\n\\n  2a sqrt(b) = 6 sqrt(6)\\n  => 2a sqrt(b) = 6 sqrt(6)\\n\\nDivide both sides by 2:\\n\\n  a sqrt(b) = 3 sqrt(6)\\n\\nSince a and b are integers, and sqrt(b) corresponds to sqrt(6) times something rational,\\n\\nWe can guess that sqrt(b) = sqrt(6), so b = 6.\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n  a sqrt(6) = 3 sqrt(6) => a = 3\\n\\nCheck the rational part:\\n\\n  a^2 + b = 15\\n  3^2 + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15\\n\\nThis holds true.\\n\\nThus, a = 3, b = 6.\\n\\nStep 2: Find k = a + 3\\n\\n  k = 3 + 3 = 6\\n\\nStep 3: Compute expected number of rolls to see every number at least once on a k-sided die that never rolls the same number twice in a row, with all other outcomes equally likely.\\n\\nThis is an altered coupon collector problem with memory because the same number cannot appear twice in a row.\\n\\nSo:\\n- The die has k = 6 sides.\\n- Probability to roll any particular number given previous roll (excluding that number) is 1/(k-1) = 1/5.\\n\\nWe want the expected number of rolls needed to see all 6 numbers at least once under this process.\\n\\nStep 3a: Model the problem\\n\\n- States: Number of distinct numbers collected so far: i = 0, 1, ..., 6\\n- Additionally, the outcome of the previous roll affects the probabilities, but since the die is symmetric and the restriction is only on the immediately preceding number, we can model the expected time to collect all coupons with the restriction \\\"no immediate repeats\\\".\\n\\nStep 3b: Known result or derivation\\n\\nFor a standard coupon collector with k coupons, expected number of draws to collect all coupons is:\\n\\n  E_standard = k * H_k\\n\\nwhere H_k = 1 + 1/2 + ... +1/k is the k-th harmonic number.\\n\\nHere, the next roll cannot be the same as the previous roll. Because of this restriction, it's harder to get the same coupon twice in a row, so the hitting probabilities to new coupons changes.\\n\\nStep 3c: Let's define the problem more precisely.\\n\\nAt any step, the probability that the next roll is a new coupon depends on the currently known coupons and the previous roll.\\n\\nLet E_i be the expected number of additional rolls needed to have seen all k coupons given i distinct coupons seen currently.\\n\\nWe want E_0.\\n\\nWe must carefully consider the 'no consecutive repeat' restriction.\\n\\nStep 3d: Let’s analyze the situation:\\n\\nWhen we have collected i distinct coupons out of k, we know that (k - i) remain unobserved.\\n\\nAt any roll, the previous roll is one of the i observed coupons.\\n\\nThe next roll cannot be the same as the previous roll.\\n\\nThe set of possible outcomes is all k sides excluding the previous side (k-1 sides).\\n\\nAmong these k-1 sides, how many are \\\"new\\\" (not in collected set) and how many are \\\"old\\\" (already collected different from the previous side)?\\n\\nNumber of new sides = (k - i)\\nNumber of old sides (not equal to previous) = i - 1 (since previous is already in the collected set)\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n- Probability of getting a new coupon next roll = (k - i) / (k - 1)\\n- Probability of getting an old coupon (not previous) = (i - 1) / (k - 1)\\n\\nStep 3e: Recurrence for E_i\\n\\nE_k = 0 (all coupons collected)\\n\\nFor 0 <= i < k:\\n\\nE_i = 1 + (k-i)/(k-1) * E_{i+1} + (i-1)/(k-1) * E_i\\n\\nExplanation:\\n- Each roll takes one step: +1\\n- With probability (k-i)/(k-1), we get a new coupon, so we move to state i+1\\n- With probability (i-1)/(k-1), we get an old coupon (not the previous), so stay in state i\\n\\nRearranged:\\n\\nE_i - ((i-1)/(k-1)) * E_i = 1 + ((k - i)/(k-1)) * E_{i+1}\\n\\nE_i * (1 - (i-1)/(k-1)) = 1 + ((k - i)/(k-1)) * E_{i+1}\\n\\nThe coefficient:\\n\\n1 - (i-1)/(k-1) = (k - i) / (k - 1)\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nE_i * (k - i)/(k - 1) = 1 + ((k - i)/(k - 1)) * E_{i+1}\\n\\nMultiply both sides by (k-1)/(k - i):\\n\\nE_i = (k - 1)/(k - i) + E_{i+1}\\n\\nThis formula expresses E_i in terms of E_{i+1}.\\n\\nStep 3f: From E_k=0:\\n\\nE_{k-1} = (k -1) / (k - (k-1)) + E_k = (k -1)/1 + 0 = k -1\\n\\nE_{k-2} = (k-1) / (k - (k-2)) + E_{k-1} = (k-1)/2 + (k-1) = (k-1)*(1 + 1/2) = (k-1)*3/2\\n\\nSimilarly, in general:\\n\\nE_i = sum_{j=i}^{k-1} (k - 1)/(k - j)\\n\\nChange variable m = k - j, as j goes from i to k-1, m goes from k - i down to 1.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nE_i = (k-1) * sum_{m=1}^{k - i} 1 / m = (k-1)*H_{k - i}\\n\\nIn particular, for i=0:\\n\\nE_0 = (k - 1) * H_k\\n\\nStep 4: Compute E_0 for k=6\\n\\nH_6 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6\\n\\nCalculate H_6:\\n\\n1 + 0.5 + 0.3333 + 0.25 + 0.2 + 0.1667 = 2.45 approximately\\n\\nSo,\\n\\nE_0 = (6 - 1) * H_6 = 5 * H_6 = 5 * (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6)\\n\\nWe want exact value:\\n\\nSum of H_6 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6\\n\\nFind LCM of denominators: 60\\n\\nConvert:\\n\\n1 = 60/60\\n1/2 = 30/60\\n1/3 = 20/60\\n1/4 = 15/60\\n1/5 = 12/60\\n1/6 = 10/60\\n\\nSum = (60 + 30 + 20 + 15 + 12 + 10) / 60 = 147 / 60\\n\\nSimplify 147/60:\\n\\nBoth divisible by 3:\\n\\n147/3 = 49\\n60/3 = 20\\n\\nSo H_6 = 49/20\\n\\nTherefore,\\n\\nE_0 = 5 * 49/20 = (5*49)/20 = 245 / 20 = 49 / 4\\n\\nFinal expected number of rolls = 49/4\\n\\nStep 5: We want to output the final answer, which is the expected number of rolls:\\n\\nAnswer = 49/4\\n\\n---\\n\\nFinal JSON as requested:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"answer\\\": \\\"49/4\\\"\\n}\\n\",\n  \"answer\": \"49/4\"\n}",
