This is because the product of two numbers with a fixed sum is maximized when the numbers are equal or as close as possible.\n\nSince 31 is an odd number, the numbers cannot both be 15.5 exactly. The closest integer pairs are:\n- \\( (15, 16) \\)\n- \\( (16, 15) \\)\n\nBoth pairs will give the same product:\n\\[ P = 15 \\times 16 = 240 \\]\n\nThis is the largest possible product \\( x y \\).\n\n---\n\nProblem 2:\nThe segment joins points \\((-9, -2)\\) and \\((6, 8)\\).\n\nStep 1: Determine how many points on the line segment have integer coordinates (both x and y integers).\n\nStep 2: We can find the number of lattice points on the line segment between these two points by using the formula related to the greatest common divisor (gcd):\n\nThe number of lattice points strictly between two points with integer coordinates is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of interior lattice points} = \\gcd(|x_2 - x_1|, |y_2 - y_1|) - 1\n\\]\n\nAnd including the endpoints, the total number of lattice points on the segment is:\n\\[\n\\gcd(|x_2 - x_1|, |y_2 - y_1|) + 1\n\\]\n\nCalculate:\n\\[\n|x_2 - x_1| = |6 - (-9)| = 15\n\\]\n\\[\n|y_2 - y_1| = |8 - (-2)| = 10\n\\]\n\nCalculate gcd(15, 10):\n\\[\n\\gcd(15, 10) = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of lattice points on the segment is:\n\\[\n5 + 1 = 6\n\\]\n\n---\n\nSummary:\n- Largest possible product \\( xy = 240 \\).\n- Number of lattice points on the line segment with integer coordinates = 6.\n\nNow, presenting the final answers in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To maximize xy with x + y = 31, x and y should be as close as possible.
