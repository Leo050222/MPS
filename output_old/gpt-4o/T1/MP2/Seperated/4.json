Julia uses 300000 MB, leaving 7200 MB free, which converts to 7 GB and 32 MB. For Problem 2, calculate the sale prices: Bicycle is 320 - 20% = 256, Helmet is 80 - 10% = 72. Total regular price is 400, total sale price is 328, savings are 72, which is 18% of the total regular price.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"7 GB 32 MB\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"18%\"\n}",
