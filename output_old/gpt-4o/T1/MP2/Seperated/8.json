  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:\nWe are given that \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers, \\( x > y \\), and \n\\[\nx + xy = 391.\n\\]\nWe can factor the left side:\n\\[\nx + xy = x(1 + y) = 391.\n\\]\nSince \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers, \\(x\\) and \\(1 + y\\) must be positive integer factors of 391.\n\nNow, factor 391:\n- 391 divided by 17 is 23 because \\(17 \\times 23 = 391\\) (checking this quickly: \\(17 \\times 20 = 340\\), \\(17 \\times 3 = 51\\), \\(340 + 51 = 391\\))\n- So, the positive integer factor pairs of 391 are:\n\\[\n(1, 391), (17, 23), (23, 17), (391, 1).\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x(1 + y) = 391\\), \\(x\\) and \\(1 + y\\) correspond to a pair above.\n\nWe want \\(x > y\\), so \\(y = (1 + y) - 1\\), and since \\(y\\) is positive, \\(1 + y > 1\\).\n\nTry factor pairs:\n\n1. \\(x = 1\\), \\(1 + y = 391 \\implies y = 390\\). But this violates \\(x > y\\) since \\(1 \\not> 390\\).\n\n2. \\(x = 17\\), \\(1 + y = 23\\) \\(\\implies y = 22\\). Check \\(x > y\\): \\(17 > 22\\)? No.\n\n3. \\(x = 23\\), \\(1 + y = 17\\) \\(\\implies y = 16\\). Check \\(x > y\\): \\(23 > 16\\), true.\n\n4. \\(x = 391\\), \\(1 + y = 1\\) \\(\\implies y = 0\\), but \\(y\\) must be positive.\n\nSo the valid solutions are \\(x = 23\\), \\(y = 16\\). The value \\(x + y = 23 + 16 = 39\\).\n\nProblem 2:\n- Total people initially: 30\n- 60% men implies men count initially \\(= 0.6 \\times 30 = 18\\)\n- Number of women initially \\(= 30 - 18 = 12\\)\n\nAfter some women enter, men remain 18 (since no men enter or leave).\n\nLet the number of new women be \\(w\\).\n\nNew total number of people: \\(30 + w\\).\n\nMen are 40% of the total, so:\n\\[\n18 = 0.4 \\times (30 + w).\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(w\\):\n\\[\n18 = 0.4 \\times (30 + w) \\implies \\\\\n18 = 12 + 0.4w \\implies \\\\\n18 - 12 = 0.4w \\implies \\\\\n6 = 0.4w \\implies \\\\\nw = \\frac{6}{0.4} = 15.\n\\]\n\nThus, 15 women must enter so that men make up 40% of the population.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Convert the equation x + xy = 391 to x(1+y) = 391. Factor 391 to find possible positive integer pairs (x, 1+y). The factors 23 and 17 satisfy x > y; thus, x=23 and y=16. So, x + y = 39. Problem 2: Initially, there are 18 men (60% of 30) and 12 women. Let w be the number of women entering. Men remain 18, which should become 40% of the total 30 + w. Solve 18 = 0.4(30 + w) to get w=15.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"39\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"15\"\n}",
