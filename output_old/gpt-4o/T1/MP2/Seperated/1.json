  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:\nKamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. on Friday, and it had been on for exactly 100 hours. We need to find the time when the computer was turned on.\n\nStep 1: Convert 100 hours backwards from 5 p.m. Friday.\n- 100 hours is equivalent to 100 ÷ 24 = 4 days and 4 hours.\n- Subtract 4 days from Friday 5 p.m.:\n  - 1 day back: Thursday 5 p.m.\n  - 2 days back: Wednesday 5 p.m.\n  - 3 days back: Tuesday 5 p.m.\n  - 4 days back: Monday 5 p.m.\n- Then subtract 4 hours:\n  - Monday 5 p.m. minus 4 hours is Monday 1 p.m.\n\nTherefore, Kamile turned her computer on at 1 p.m. on Monday.\n\nProblem 2:\nWe are given the numbers 2, 3, 4, 6 and we want to find three different numbers from this list whose sum is 11. Then we find the product of these three numbers.\n\nStep 1: List combinations of three different numbers from the list:\n- 2, 3, 4: sum = 9\n- 2, 3, 6: sum = 11\n- 2, 4, 6: sum = 12\n- 3, 4, 6: sum = 13\n\nThe combination whose sum is 11 is 2, 3, and 6.\n\nStep 2: Find the product:\n2 × 3 × 6 = 36\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, converting 100 hours backwards from 5 p.m. Friday gives 4 days and 4 hours earlier, which is Monday 1 p.m. For Problem 2, the three numbers from the list that sum to 11 are 2, 3, and 6, and their product is 36.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"Monday 1 p.m.\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"36\"\n}",
