  "math_problem": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$. Shuxin begins with $d$ red candies, 7 yellow candies, and 3 blue candies. After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining. What is the smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate?",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Ratio problem (Skateboards and Bicycles):**\n\n   Given:\n   - Ratio of skateboards to bicycles = 7 : 4\n   - There are 12 more skateboards than bicycles\n   \n   Let the scaling factor be \\( k \\). Then:\n   - Number of skateboards = \\( 7k \\)\n   - Number of bicycles = \\( 4k \\)\n   \n   Since skateboards are 12 more than bicycles:\n   \\[\n   7k - 4k = 12 \\implies 3k = 12 \\implies k = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\( d = k + 6 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   d = 4 + 6 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Candy problem:**\n\n   Shuxin starts with:\n   - \\( d = 10 \\) red candies\n   - 7 yellow candies\n   - 3 blue candies\n\n   After eating some candies, the number of remaining candies of each color is equal.\n\n   Let this common remaining number be \\( x \\). Then:\n   - Remaining red candies = \\( x \\leq 10 \\)\n   - Remaining yellow candies = \\( x \\leq 7 \\)\n   - Remaining blue candies = \\( x \\leq 3 \\)\n\n   Since \\( x \\) must be equal for all colors, the maximum possible \\( x \\) is the smallest initial number of candies:\n   \\[\n   x \\leq \\min(10, 7, 3) = 3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find smallest number of candies eaten:**\n\n   Total candies initially:\n   \\[\n   10 + 7 + 3 = 20\n   \\]\n\n   After eating:\n   \\[\n   3 + 3 + 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n   Total eaten:\n   \\[\n   20 - 9 = 11\n   \\]\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"11\"\n}\n```",
