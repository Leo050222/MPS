  "math_problem": "Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. Friday, at which point it had been on for exactly 100 hours. At what time had Kamile turned her computer on? Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day. Three different numbers from the list $2, 3, 4, 6$ have a sum of $k$. What is the product of these numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Understand the problem.\\n- Kamile turned off her computer at 5 p.m. Friday.\\n- The computer had been on for exactly 100 hours at that point.\\n- We are not asked to find the exact time the computer was turned on but rather to compute a value k = h + 7, where h is the remainder when 100 is divided by the number of hours in a day (which is 24).\\n- After finding k, we are told that three different numbers chosen from the list {2, 3, 4, 6} add up to k.\\n- We need to find the product of these three numbers.\\n\\nStep 2: Compute h.\\n- Number of hours in a day = 24.\\n- Total duration the computer was on = 100 hours.\\n- Find the remainder h when 100 is divided by 24.\\n  24 * 4 = 96, remainder = 100 - 96 = 4.\\n  So, h = 4.\\n\\nStep 3: Compute k.\\n- k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11.\\n\\nStep 4: Find three different numbers from {2, 3, 4, 6} that sum to 11.\\n- Possible triplets:\\n  (2,3,4) sum = 9\\n  (2,3,6) sum = 11\\n  (2,4,6) sum = 12\\n  (3,4,6) sum = 13\\n- The only triplet summing to 11 is (2, 3, 6).\\n\\nStep 5: Find the product of these numbers.\\n- Product = 2 * 3 * 6 = 36.\\n\\nFinal answer: 36\",\n  \"answer\": \"36\"\n}",
