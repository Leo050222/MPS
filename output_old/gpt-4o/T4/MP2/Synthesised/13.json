7 = 7 -7 = 0.\\n\\n--\\n\\nStep 10: Solve the functional equation:\\nWith k = 0, domain is R_{>0}.\\nEquation:\\nf((c+1)x + f(y)) = f(x + 2y) + 2cx, for all x,y > 0 and c > 0 given.\\n\\nStep 11: Try to find solution f: R_{>0} → R_{>0}.\\nGuess f is linear: f(t) = m t + b.\\nPlug in:\\nf((c+1)x + f(y)) = m*((c+1)x + m y + b) + b = m(c+1)x + m^2 y + m b + b\\n\\nRHS:\\nf(x + 2y) + 2 c x = m(x + 2y) + b + 2 c x = m x + 2 m y + b + 2 c x\\n\\nSet equal:\\nm(c+1) x + m^2 y + m b + b = m x + 2 m y + b + 2 c x\\n\\nCollect terms:\\nCoefficients of x:\\n m(c+1) = m + 2 c\\nCoefficients of y:\\n m^2 = 2 m\\nConstants:\\n m b + b = b\\n\\nFrom constants:\\nb(m + 1) = b\\nIf b ≠ 0 then m + 1 = 1 ⇒ m = 0\\nIf m=0, then f(t)=b\\nBut f: R_{>0} → R_{>0}, constant function.\\nTry m=0,\\nLHS: f((c+1)x + b) = b\\nRHS: f(x + 2y) + 2 c x = b + 2 c x,\\nContradiction since RHS not constant.\\nSo b=0\\n\\nFrom coefficients of y:\\n m^2 = 2 m\\n=> m^2 - 2m = 0\\n=> m(m-2) = 0\\n=> m = 0 or m=2\\nm=0 discarded (doesn't satisfy constant)\\nm=2 check x coefficients:\\nm(c+1) = m + 2c\\n2(c+1) = 2 + 2c\\n2c + 2 = 2 + 2 c\\nTrue\\n\\nSo m=2, b=0 is a solution.\\n\\nf(t) = 2 t.\\n\\nCheck if domain is R_{>0} → R_{>0}, f(t) = 2 t is positive on positive domain.\\nCheck original equation:\\nf((c+1) x + f(y)) = f((c+1) x + 2 y) = 2((c+1) x + 2 y) = 2(c+1) x + 4 y\\nRHS: f(x + 2 y) + 2 c x = 2(x + 2 y) + 2 c x = 2 x + 4 y + 2 c x = (2 + 2 c) x + 4 y = 2 (c+1) x + 4 y\\nEqual. So it works.\\n\\nStep 12: Hence the final answers:\\n\\nk=0\\nf(x)=2 x for x > 0.\\n\\nAnswer format is:\\nFor the first part, report k = a_9 - 7 = 0\\nFor second part, all functions f: R_{>k} → R_{>0} satisfying the equation are f(x) = 2 x.\\n\\n\",\n  \"answer\": \"0; f(x)=2x\"\n}",
