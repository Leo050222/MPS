Then floor(α^n) = 2017 * m_n for some integer m_n.\\n\\nBut α^n would be close to an integer multiple of 2017.\\n\\nOne possibility is α^n = 2017 * m_n + δ_n where 0 ≤ δ_n < 1.\\n\\nBecause α is irrational, its powers don't align nicely with multiples of 2017.\\n\\nMoreover, the condition must hold for infinitely many n, which is highly restrictive.\\n\\nThe only way for floor(α^n) to be divisible by 2017 for infinitely many n is if α^n itself is an integer multiple of 2017 plus a fractional part less than 1.\\n\\nHowever for this to hold for all n ≥ k, floor(α^n) ≡ 0 mod 2017, which is quite restrictive.\\n\\nIn fact, no such irrational α exists because:\\n- If α^n grows continuously,\\n- The fractional parts α^n mod 1 are dense mod 1 for irrational α,\\n- So floor(α^n) modulo 2017 cannot be constantly zero for all large n.\\n\\nHence no such α exists.\\n\\nFinal summary:\\n- P(2) = 2\\n- k = 1\\n- No irrational α > k exists satisfying the modular condition.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answers are:\\n\\nk = 1\\nThere does not exist such an irrational α satisfying the condition.\\n\\n\",\n  \"answer\": \"No\"\n}",
