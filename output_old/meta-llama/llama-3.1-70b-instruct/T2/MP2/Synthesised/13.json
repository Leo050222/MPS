  "math_problem": "The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to $k>0$, find $k$. Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition. A ladder is leaning against a house with its lower end $d$ feet from the house. When the lower end is pulled 9 feet farther from the house, the upper end slides 13 feet down. How long is the ladder (in feet)?",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Find the value of k**\n\n- Let the width of the rectangle be \\( w \\).\n- The length of the rectangle is \\( 3w \\).\n- The perimeter \\( P \\) is given by:\n  \\[\n  P = 2(\\text{length} + \\text{width}) = 2(3w + w) = 2(4w) = 8w\n  \\]\n- The area \\( A \\) is:\n  \\[\n  A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 3w \\times w = 3w^2\n  \\]\n- Given that perimeter and area are both equal to \\( k \\):\n  \\[\n  8w = k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 3w^2 = k\n  \\]\n- Equate these:\n  \\[\n  8w = 3w^2\n  \\]\n- Rearrange:\n  \\[\n  3w^2 - 8w = 0\n  \\]\n- Factor:\n  \\[\n  w(3w - 8) = 0\n  \\]\n- Since \\(w > 0\\), we have:\n  \\[\n  3w - 8 = 0 \\implies w = \\frac{8}{3}\n  \\]\n- Find \\(k\\):\n  \\[\n  k = 8w = 8 \\times \\frac{8}{3} = \\frac{64}{3}\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: Find \\( d = w + \\frac{37}{3} \\)**\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{8}{3} + \\frac{37}{3} = \\frac{8 + 37}{3} = \\frac{45}{3} = 15\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Part 3: Find the length of the ladder**\n\n- The ladder leans against the house with its lower end \\( d = 15 \\) feet from the house.\n- When pulled 9 feet farther, the new distance from the house becomes:\n  \\[\n  d + 9 = 15 + 9 = 24\n  \\]\n- The ladder also slides down 13 feet, so the vertical height after sliding is:\n  \\[\n  h - 13\n  \\]\n- At the initial position:\n  \\[\n  \\text{height} = h\n  \\]\n- Using Pythagoras' theorem:\n\n  **Initial ladder length:**\n  \\[\n  L = \\sqrt{d^2 + h^2}\n  \\]\n  \n  **After pulling and sliding down:**\n  \\[\n  L = \\sqrt{(d+9)^2 + (h - 13)^2}\n  \\]\n  \n- Since the ladder length \\( L \\) remains the same:\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{15^2 + h^2} = \\sqrt{24^2 + (h-13)^2}\n  \\]\n- Square both sides:\n  \\[\n  15^2 + h^2 = 24^2 + (h - 13)^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  225 + h^2 = 576 + h^2 - 26h + 169\n  \\]\n- Simplify:\n  \\[\n  225 + h^2 = 745 + h^2 - 26h\n  \\]\n- Cancel \\( h^2 \\) from both sides:\n  \\[\n  225 = 745 - 26h\n  \\]\n- Solve for \\(h\\):\n  \\[\n  26h = 745 - 225 = 520\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  h = \\frac{520}{26} = 20\n  \\]\n  \n- Find the length \\( L \\):\n  \\[\n  L = \\sqrt{15^2 + 20^2} = \\sqrt{225 + 400} = \\sqrt{625} = 25\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"25\"\n}\n```",
