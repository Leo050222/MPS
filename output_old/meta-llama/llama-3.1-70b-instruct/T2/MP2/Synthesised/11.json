  "math_problem": "Wendy eats sushi for lunch. She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, labeled as follows:\n\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} A & B & C \\\\ D & E & F \\\\ \\end{array}$\n\nwhere pieces are adjacent if they share a side (not counting diagonally), with adjacencies $A$-$B$, $A$-$D$, $B$-$C$, $B$-$E$, $C$-$F$, $D$-$E$, $E$-$F$. The pieces of sushi are distinguishable. She can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other remaining pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row. Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers randomly (and independently) chosen from the range $[0,1]$. Find the probability that $a$, $b$ and $k$ form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle.",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze the problem carefully. We have a grid of 6 pieces labeled as follows:\n\nA B C  \nD E F\n\nAdjacencies are: A-B, A-D, B-C, B-E, C-F, D-E, E-F.\n\n**Part 1:** Find \\(k = \\deg(F) + 0\\) after the specified process:\n\n- The process says: \"after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row.\"  \n- The top row endpoints are A and C, so we first eat A and C.\n\n**Remaining pieces after eating A and C:**\n\nRemaining: B, D, E, F\n\nThe subgraph induced on these remaining pieces:\n\nEdges among B, D, E, F are:\n\n- B-D? No\n- B-E? Yes\n- D-E? Yes\n- E-F? Yes\n- B-F? No\n- D-F? No\n\nGraph structure among remaining:  \nB—E—F  \n|  \nD—E (wait, check D-E: yes; D-E is listed, so D and E are adjacent; and E-F is adjacent)\n\nEdges:  \nB—E, E—F, D—E\n\n**Degree of F in this subgraph:**\n\n- F connected only to E, so \\(\\deg(F) = 1\\).\n\n**Answer in this part:** \\(k = 1\\)\n\n---\n\n**Part 2:** Next, it says: *\"instead of counting total number of valid eating orders, find \\(k\\) as above.\"* We've found \\(k=1\\).\n\nNow, we're asked about probabilities involving \\(a, b\\) and \\(k\\):\n\n- \\(a, b\\) are independently chosen from [0,1].\n- Find the probability that \\(a, b, k\\) form the sides of an obtuse triangle.\n\nSince \\(k=1\\), we are considering triangles with side lengths \\(a, b, 1\\).\n\nThe key is: when do \\(a, b, 1\\) form an obtuse triangle? \n\nA triangle with sides \\(x, y, z\\) (positive) is obtuse if and only if the largest side squared is greater than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nCase 1: Largest side is 1:\n\n- They form an obtuse triangle if \\(1^2 > a^2 + b^2\\), i.e., \\(1 > a^2 + b^2\\).\n\nSince \\(a, b \\in [0,1]\\), this is the region:\n\n\\(\\{(a, b) \\in [0,1]^2 | a^2 + b^2 < 1\\}\\).\n\n**Probability of this event:**\n\n- Area of the quarter circle of radius 1 in the positive quadrant:  \nArea \\(= \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\).\n\n- Because \\(a, b\\) are uniform in [0,1], the probability is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\).\n\nCase 2: Largest side is \\(a\\) or \\(b\\):\n\n- For an obtuse triangle, the side lengths must satisfy the triangle inequality:\n\n  \\(a < b + 1\\), \\(b < a + 1\\), and \\(1 < a + b\\).\n\n  \n\n- When \\(a, b \\in [0,1]\\), \\(a + b \\le 2\\), so the inequality \\(1 < a + b\\) is the key for obtuseness with the largest side being \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) only if the side lengths satisfy triangle inequalities.\n\n- For \\(a \\ge b\\), the largest side is \\(a\\). The triangle is obtuse if:\n\n  \\(a^2 > b^2 + 1^2 = b^2 + 1\\).\n\nSince \\(a, b \\le 1\\), the maximum \\(a^2\\) is 1, but for \\(a^2 > b^2 +1\\), this cannot occur because \\(b^2 \\le 1\\), so \\(b^2 + 1 \\ge 1\\). The maximum value of \\(a^2\\) is 1, so \\(a^2 > b^2 +1\\) cannot hold inside [0,1].\n\nSimilarly for the case when \\(b\\) is the largest side.\n\nThus, the only feasible case is when the largest side is 1, and \\(a^2 + b^2 < 1\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nProbability = the area of \\(\\{(a, b) \\in [0,1]^2 : a^2 + b^2 < 1 \\}\\) = \\(\\pi/4\\).\n\n---\n\n**Final step:** The answer is the probability that the three sides form an obtuse triangle, which is \\(\\pi/4\\).\n\n**Answer in JSON:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"answer\": \"pi/4\"\n}\n```",
