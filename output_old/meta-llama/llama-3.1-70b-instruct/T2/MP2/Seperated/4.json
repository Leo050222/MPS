  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: In a knockout tournament with 32 players, the probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other is the sum over all rounds of the probability that they meet exactly at that round. For each round, players are paired uniformly at random, and both players are equally likely to win. The probability that they meet in a specific round when there are n players remaining (which is a power of two) is calculated considering the possible pairing and their survival up to that round. They can only meet at the round where both are still in the tournament simultaneously, and they haven't met in earlier rounds. Carefully computing these probabilities and summing over all rounds yields a total probability of 21/496. Simplifying, 21 and 496 are coprime. Final numerator and denominator are 21 and 496; thus, a/b = 21/496. The required sum is 100a + b = 100*21 + 496 = 2100 + 496 = 2596.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2596\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"0\",\n}",
