Let $p_{N}$ denote the probability that the product of these two integers has a units digit of 0.

To maximize the probability, N should include as many multiples of 5 and 2 as possible. Since the units digit depends on these factors, the maximum probability is achieved when N is large enough so that the set of numbers includes multiples of 5 and 2. When N is large, the probability p_N approaches the maximum. The probability that both numbers produce a product ending in 0 can be computed considering cases where either number ends with 0 or both are divisible by 2 and 5. Analyzing this, the maximum probability turns out to be 3/5, as it occurs when N is at least 10. Thus, the maximum probability p_N is 3/5, where a=3 and b=5. Final answer: 100 * 3 + 5 = 305.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"305\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"512\"\n}",
