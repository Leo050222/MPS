  "reasoning_content": "Let's address each problem step by step.\n\n**Problem 1: Minimum amount Victoria needs to pay**\n\n1. Victoria needs at least 550 donuts.\n2. Donuts are only sold in multiples of 12.\n3. Determine the minimum number of donuts she must buy:\n   - Since donuts are in multiples of 12, find the smallest multiple of 12 that is ≥ 550.\n   - Divide 550 by 12: 550 / 12 ≈ 45.8333.\n   - The next integer multiple after 45.8333 is 46.\n   - 46 × 12 = 552 donuts.\n4. Cost per 12 donuts: $7.49.\n5. Total cost: 46 × $7.49 = $344.54 (exact calculation).\n\n**Problem 2: Prime numbers p such that 5p can be expressed as the floor of (n^2/5) for some positive integer n**\n\n1. Write the problem as: for some positive integer n, floor(n²/5) = 5p.\n2. Since p is prime, and 5p = floor(n²/5), then n²/5 ∈ [5p, 5p + 1), because the floor value is 5p.\n3. So, n²/5 ≥ 5p and n²/5 < 5p + 1.\n4. Multiply by 5: n² ≥ 25p and n² < 5(5p + 1) = 25p + 5.\n5. Therefore, n² is an integer satisfying:\n\n   25p ≤ n² < 25p + 5.\n\n6. n² must be in the interval [25p, 25p + 5).\n\n7. Since n² is a perfect square, within that interval, for different p, possible n's are those where:\n   - n² = 25p + k, where 0 ≤ k < 5.\n\n8. For each prime p, analyze possible n:\n\n   - For n² = 25p + k, with 0 ≤ k < 5:\n     - n ≈ √(25p + k), which should be close to 5√p, because √(25p + k) ≈ 5√p + some small correction.\n\n9. But more straightforward: since n² is between 25p and 25p + 5, n must satisfy:\n\n   - n² ≈ 25p (meaning n ≈ 5√p).\n\n10. Check for small primes p:\n\n    - For p=2: n² ∈ [50, 55).\n      - n ≈ √50 ≈ 7.07, so n could be 7.\n      - n=7 ⇒ n²=49, which is less than 50, so no.\n      - n=8 ⇒ n²=64, too big.\n      - No solution here.\n\n    - For p=3: interval: [75, 80).\n      - √75 ≈ 8.66 → n can be 8 or 9.\n      - n=8 → n²=64, too small.\n      - n=9 → n²=81, in the interval.\n      - 81 ∈ [75,80)? No, 81 > 80. So no.\n\n    - For p=5: interval: [125, 130).\n      - √125 ≈ 11.18.\n      - n=11 → 121, too small.\n      - n=12 → 144, too large.\n      - No.\n\n    - For p=7: interval: [175, 180).\n      - √175 ≈ 13.23\n      - n=13 → 169, too small.\n      - n=14 → 196, too large.\n      - no.\n\n    - For larger p, similarly, check whether n² can fall into the interval. As p increases, the approximate n is around 5√p.\n\n    - To find suitable p, note that n² must be around 25p:\n\n      n ≈ 5√p\n\n    - For p=23:\n\n      n ≈ 5√23 ≈ 5×4.796 ≈ 23.98.\n\n      n=24:\n\n      n²=576.\n\n      Check whether 576 ∈ [25×23, 25×23 + 5) = [575, 580).\n\n      576 is in [575, 580). Good!\n\n      Now verify floor(n²/5):\n\n      n=24:\n\n      n²=576.\n\n      n²/5=576/5=115.2.\n\n      floor(115.2)=115.\n\n      5p=5×23=115.\n\n      Great! So p=23 works.\n\n    - For p=hi:\n\n      n ≈ 5√p.\n\n      Next, try p=29:\n\n      n≈5×√29≈5×5.385≈26.92.\n\n      n=27:\n\n      n²=729.\n\n      interval: [25×29, 25×29+5) = [725,730).\n\n      729 ∈ [725,730): Yes.\n\n      n=27:\n\n      n²=729.\n\n      n²/5=145.8.\n\n      floor=145.\n\n      5p=5×29=145. Perfect.\n\n    - Next, check p=13:\n\n      n≈5×√13≈5×3.605=18.02,\n\n      n=18:\n\n      n²=324.\n\n      interval: [25×13, 25×13+5) = [325, 330), but 324<325, so no.\n\n      n=19:\n\n      361, too big.\n\n    - p=13: no.\n\n    - p=23: yes.\n\n    - p=29: yes.\n\n    - For other primes, similar checks can confirm there are no additional solutions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The two primes p are 23 and 29, corresponding to the solutions found.\n\n- Sum: 23 + 29 = 52.\n\nNow, consolidating the answers:\n\n- Problem 1: total minimum cost = \\$344.54.\n- Problem 2: sum of the two primes: 52.\n\n---\n\n**Final JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Minimum donuts needed is 552 (since 46×12=552), costing 46×7.49=344.54 dollars.
