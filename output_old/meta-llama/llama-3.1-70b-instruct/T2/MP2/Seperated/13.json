  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let the width of the rectangle be w and the length be 3w. The perimeter is 2(w + 3w) = 8w, and the area is w * 3w = 3w^2. Given that the perimeter and area are both equal to k, we have 8w = k and 3w^2 = k. Equate these: 8w = 3w^2 => 3w^2 - 8w = 0 => w(3w - 8) = 0. Since w > 0, w = 8/3. Substitute into k: k = 8w = 8 * (8/3) = 64/3.  \n  Problem 2: Let the length of the ladder be L. Initially, the lower end is 15 feet from the house, and the ladder leaning against the house forms a right triangle with vertical height h and horizontal distance 15. So, L^2 = h^2 + 15^2. When pulling the lower end 9 feet farther, the new distance is 24, and the upper end slides down, reducing height to h - 13. The new right triangle has hypotenuse L, horizontal side 24, and vertical side h - 13, so L^2 = (h - 13)^2 + 24^2. Equate these: h^2 + 225 = (h - 13)^2 + 576. Expanding: h^2 + 225 = h^2 - 26h + 169 + 576. Simplify: 225 = -26h + 745 => -26h = 225 - 745 = -520 => h = 20. Now, find L: L^2 = h^2 + 225 = 20^2 + 225 = 400 + 225 = 625. So, L = sqrt(625) = 25.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"64/3\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"25\"\n}",
