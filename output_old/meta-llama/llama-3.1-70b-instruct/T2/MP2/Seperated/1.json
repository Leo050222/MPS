  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The function f(n) is defined with specific rules. It is 0 if n is perfect or if the last digit of n is 4. For composite numbers, f(a.b) = f(a) + f(b), where a.b is the concatenation of digits. We interpret f(n) as a sum over the parts of n based on concatenation. Since the last digit rule gives f(n) = 0 when last digit is 4, and perfect numbers also give f(n) = 0, the function f(n) is 0 for all n ending with 4 or perfect. For other n, such as 1998, which does not end with 4 and is not perfect, we see the last digit is 8. Since the last digit is not 4, f(1998) depends on the leading part and the last digit (9 and 8). We use the recursive rule: f(1998) = f(199) + f(8). Now, 8 ends with 8 (not 4), and 199 is not perfect and does not end with 4, so f(8) = f(8) (base case). For the structure of the problems, the key is that the only numbers for which f(n) is explicitly 0 are perfect or ending with 4. All other numbers may have their value determined recursively, but given the problem constraints and no other information, the simplest interpretation is that for 1998, which does not satisfy the conditions for f(n)=0, f(1998) is determined by the recursive sum. Because there is no further restriction, and the function summing over parts is a recursive addition with zeros for last digit 4 and perfects, the best consistent answer is f(1998)=0, as all other parts reduce similarly. The problem appears constructed such that f(1998)=0.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"20\"\n}",
