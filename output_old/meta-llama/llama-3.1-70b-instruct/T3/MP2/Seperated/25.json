The point (x, y) is uniformly selected in the unit square, so (x, y) ∈ [0,1]×[0,1]. To find the probability that (3x+2y, x+4y) is in S, we need the area of the set of (x,y) such that both coordinates are between 0 and 1. This is equivalent to the set of (x,y) satisfying: 0 ≤ 3x + 2y ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ x + 4y ≤ 1, with x,y ∈ [0,1]. The feasible region in the xy-plane is the intersection of these two inequalities, which form a parallelogram. Solving the inequalities for the region, the combined conditions define a parallelogram with vertices at (0,0), (1/3,0), (0, 1/2), and (1/3, 1/2). Calculating the area of this parallelogram yields (1/3)*(1/2)=1/6. The probability is the ratio of this area over the total area of the unit square (which is 1), so probability = 1/6= a/b with a=1 and b=6. Thus, 100a + b = 100*1 + 6=106.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"106\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"Probability is 1/6\",\n}",
