  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We need to find integer pairs (m, n) satisfying m^5 - n^5 = 16mn. First, consider small values for n and see if the equation simplifies or yields solutions. For n=0, m^5 = 0, so m=0, giving the pair (0,0). Check this pair: 0 - 0 = 0, and 16*0=0, so it satisfies.\\nNext, try n=1: m^5 - 1 = 16m. Rearranged as m^5 - 16m - 1=0. Since m is integer, test small m: m=1: 1 - 16 - 1=-16≠0, m=-1: -1 + 16 - 1=14≠0, so no. Similarly for other small m-values.\\nTry n=-1: m^5 - (-1)^5= 16 m -> m^5 +1=16 m. For m=0: 1=0, no. m=1: 1+1=16, no. m=-1: -1+1=-1, no.\\nNext, consider potential factorizations using differences of fifth powers. Note that the difference of fifth powers factors as (m - n)(m^4 + m^3 n + m^2 n^2 + m n^3 + n^4). The equation becomes (m - n)(m^4 + m^3 n + m^2 n^2 + m n^3 + n^4) = 16 m n.\\nSince both sides are symmetric, check for simple solutions when m and n are small integers. The only trivial solution found is (0,0). Now, test a few more pairs where m=n, as m^5 - n^5=0, and the RHS is 16 m^2. Since m^5= m^5, the equation reduces to 0=16 m^2, which only holds when m=0.\\nNext, check if solutions exist for m = -n, then the left side is m^5 - (-m)^5 = m^5 + m^5= 2 m^5. The right side: 16 m (-m) = -16 m^2. The equation: 2 m^5 = -16 m^2, or 2 m^5 + 16 m^2= 0. Factor: 2 m^2 (m^3 + 8)=0, giving m=0 or m^3 +8=0. If m=0, then n=0, already found. If m^3 +8=0, m= -2, then n=2, since n = -m.\\nCheck m= -2, n=2: Left side: (-2)^5 - 2^5= -32 - 32= -64. Right side: 16 * (-2) * 2= -64. Equal! So, (m, n)= (-2, 2) is a solution.\\nNow, check for m=2, n=-2: Left: 32 - (-32)= 64, right: 16*2*(-2)= -64, not equal.\\nSimilarly, for m= -2, n=2, the solution works.\\nIn summary, solutions include (0,0), and (-2,2).\\nThus, solutions found are (0,0) and (-2,2). No other small integers satisfy the equation based on the tests.\\nTherefore, the solutions are (0,0) and (-2,2). \\n\\nProblem 2: The polynomial is x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48 with roots p, q, r, positive and p<q<r. By Vieta's formulas: p+q+r=a, pq+ pr + q r = b, and p q r =48.\\nWe want to minimize 1/p + 2/q + 3/r.\\nGiven p<q<r>0 and pqr=48, and all are positive, AM-GM inequalities give some constraints.\\nTo minimize 1/p + 2/q + 3/r, larger roots will decrease the sum if the reciprocal is decreasing, i.e., larger p, q, r are better. But p q r=48. \\nTo minimize the sum, choose p as large as possible, q as large as possible relative to p, r as large as possible relative to q, subject to p<q<r and pqr=48.\\nLet’s try to find suitable values. Suppose p = t, then q and r satisfy q>p, r>q, and pqr=48 => r= 48/(p q).\\nTo minimize, choose the smallest p (since 1/p is largest when p is small), but p>0.\\nNext, set p as small as possible, approaching 0, but p>0.\\nSince p is positive, very small p makes 1/p very large; thus, the sum will tend to infinity. To get finite minimum, find a balance where p is not too small, q and r are determined accordingly.\\nAlternatively, consider symmetry: assume p=q, then p^2 r=48 => r=48/(p^2), and the sum becomes 1/p + 2/p + 3/(48/(p^2)) = (3/p) + (3 p^2 / 48) = (3/p) + (p^2 / 16).\\nMinimize this over p>0: derivative: -3/p^2 + (2 p)/16 = -3/p^2 + p/8. Set to zero: -3/p^2 + p/8= 0 => p/8=3/p^2 => p^3 = 24 => p= cube root of 24.\\nCalculate p= cube root of 24: approximately 2.8845.\\nCalculate sum: 3/p + p^2/16: 3/2.8845 + (2.8845)^2 /16: about 1.04 + (8.32)/16= 1.04 + 0.52= approximately 1.56.\\nThis is an approximate minimal value, but to get exact, p= cube root of 24, r=48/(p^2), q=p, and the sum is 1/p + 2/p + 3/r.\\nSubstitute p= cube root of 24, q= p, r=48/p^2.\\nCalculate sum exactly: 1/p + 2/p + 3/r = 3/p + 3/(48/p^2)= 3/p + (3 p^2)/48= 3/p + p^2/16 as above.\\nThe minimal value is attained at p= cube root of 24, r=48/p^2, q=p. \\nFinal exact value: the minimum of 3/p + p^2/16 at p= cube root of 24.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"(-2, 2)\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\" \n}",
