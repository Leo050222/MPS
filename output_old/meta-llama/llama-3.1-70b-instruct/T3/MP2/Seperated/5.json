      "A1054": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Each student has a subset of the 8 antigens, so the total number of students is 2^8 = 256, with each subset representing a unique blood type. The foreign antigens for each student are those not in their subset. Since the total antigens are 8, and the student's blood type is a subset, the number of foreign antigens for that student is 8 minus the size of their subset. Each student is bitten once, and the suffering is equal to the number of foreign antigens, which varies depending on their subset, but since Quito chooses students uniformly at random and in random order, the expected suffering per student can be calculated based on the expected number of foreign antigens in a student's subset. The expected size of a random subset of an 8-element set is 8/2 = 4, so the expected number of foreign antigens (which is 8 minus the size of the subset) is 8 minus the expected size, which is 8 - 4 = 4. This means each student has an expected foreign antigen count of 4, and total suffering is 256 students * 4 hours = 1024 hours.\",\n  \n  \"answer_1\": \"1024\",\n  \n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 2: Let the three integers be x, y, and z. Alex chooses any two of these integers, averages them, and adds the result to the third. The results are 42, 13, and 37. Let's analyze the possibilities: If the final results are obtained by adding the average of two integers to the third, then the three possible outcomes are: a) x + (y+z)/2 = 42, b) y + (x+z)/2 = 13, c) z + (x+y)/2 = 37. From these, multiply through to clear denominators: 2x + y + z = 84, 2y + x + z = 26, 2z + x + y = 74. Subtract equations pairwise to find relations between x, y, and z. Subtracting the second from the first gives: (2x + y + z) - (2y + x + z) = 84 - 26, which simplifies to x - y = 58. Subtracting the third from the first yields: (2x + y + z) - (2z + x + y) = 84 - 74, simplifying to x - z = 10. Now, express y and z in terms of x: y = x - 58, z = x - 10. Using the second original equation: 2y + x + z = 26, substitute y and z: 2(x - 58) + x + (x - 10) = 26. Simplify: 2x - 116 + x + x - 10 = 26, leading to 4x - 126 = 26, so 4x = 152, and x = 38. Then y = 38 - 58 = -20, z = 38 - 10 = 28. Check if these values produce the given results: x + (y+z)/2 = 38 + (-20 + 28)/2 = 38 + 8/2 = 38 + 4 = 42 (matches), y + (x+z)/2 = -20 + (38 + 28)/2 = -20 + 66/2 = -20 + 33 = 13 (matches), z + (x+y)/2 = 28 + (38 - 20)/2 = 28 + 18/2 = 28 + 9 = 37 (matches). Therefore, the original integers are 38, -20, and 28.\",\n  \n  \"answer_2\": \"38, -20, 28\"\n}",
