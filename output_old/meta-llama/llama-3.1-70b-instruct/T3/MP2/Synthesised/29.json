FemtoPravis is walking on an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard that wraps around at its edges (so squares on the left edge of the chessboard are adjacent to squares on the right edge, and similarly for the top and bottom edges). Each femtosecond, FemtoPravis moves in one of the four diagonal directions uniformly at random. After $n$ femtoseconds, what is the probability that FemtoPravis is at his original location?",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's carefully analyze and solve the mathematical problem step by step.\n\n**Given problem:**\nFind all prime numbers \\( p, q, r \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{q} - \\frac{4}{r + 1} = 1\n\\]\n\nWe are asked to find \\( n = r + 2009 \\), where \\( r \\) is a prime number such that \\( r + 1 \\) equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Rearrange the equation\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{q} = 1 + \\frac{4}{r + 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{(r + 1)}{(r + 1)} + \\frac{4}{r + 1} = \\frac{(r + 1) + 4}{r + 1} = \\frac{r + 5}{r + 1}\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{r + 5}{r + 1}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Connect numerator and denominator\n\nSince \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are prime numbers, the fraction \\( p/q \\) must be in lowest terms (or at least equal to the simplified form).\n\n\\[\np/q = (r + 5)/(r + 1)\n\\]\n\nThe numerator and denominator are integers, so for \\( p, q \\) to be primes, and the fraction to match \\( (r + 5)/(r + 1) \\), these must be:\n\n\\[\np = r + 5\n\\]\n\\[\nq = r + 1\n\\]\nor, possibly, the fraction simplifies further if there is a common factor.\n\n### Step 3: Constraints on \\( p, q \\):\n\n- \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are primes.\n- \\( q = r + 1 \\) must be prime, so \\( r + 1 \\) is prime.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Conditions on \\( r \\):\n\n- \\( r \\) must be prime.\n- \\( r + 1 \\) must be prime. \n\nThus, \\( r \\) and \\( r + 1 \\) are both primes, which are consecutive.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Prime pairs where consecutive integers are both prime\n\nThe only such pairs of primes separated by 1 are:\n\n- \\( r = 2 \\), \\( r + 1 = 3 \\)\n\nAny larger consecutive primes (e.g., 3 and 5), differ by more than 1, so no longer possible.\n\nHence,\n\n\\[\nr = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nr + 1 = 3\n\\]\n\nNow, compute:\n\n\\[\np = r + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\n\\]\n\\[\nq = r + 1 = 3\n\\]\n\nCheck whether \\( p = 7 \\) and \\( q=3 \\) are prime: yes, they are.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Final check\n\n- \\( p = 7 \\), prime.\n- \\( q = 3 \\), prime.\n- \\( r = 2 \\), prime.\n\nThese satisfy the original equation.\n\n### Step 7: Find \\( n = r + 2009 \\)\n\n\\[\nn = 2 + 2009 = 2011\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final step: output the result\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"2011\"\n}\n```",
