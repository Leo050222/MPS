  "reasoning_content": "Let's approach this step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the problem**\n\nWe need to consider subsets \\( S \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\} \\), which are non-empty and have no subset summing to 10.\n\nWe focus on calculating \\( N_5 \\): the number of non-empty subsets \\( S \\) with the largest element 5 satisfying the no-sum-10 condition.\n\nThen, compute \\( k = N_5 - 8 \\).\n\nFinally, find the number of ordered triples \\((a, b, c)\\) of nonnegative integers satisfying: \\((ab + k)(bc + k)(ca + k) = 84\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Find \\( N_5 \\)**\n\n\\( N_5 \\) counts subsets \\( S \\), with the largest element exactly 5, that satisfy the no-sum-10 condition.\n\n- The subsets with maximum element 5 are those that include 5, but no larger element, and possibly smaller elements, but must not have any subset summing to 10.\n\n- Elements in the subset are from \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\).\n\n- The subset must contain 5, and the rest are from \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\).\n\n- The total subset size varies from 1 (only 5) up to 5 (all of \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}).\n\n- Since the largest element is 5, and the subset is non-empty, the minimal size is 1 (just 5), and the maximum is 5.\n\n- However, the subset must satisfy that no subset has sum 10.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: List subsets with largest element 5**\n\n- Subsets must contain 5.\n\n- For each subset \\( S \\) that contains 5, consider the subset of the other elements \\( T \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\).\n\n- The size of \\( T \\) varies from 0 to 4.\n\n- For each \\( T \\), \\( S = T \\cup \\{5\\} \\).\n\n- Conditions:\n\n    1. No subset of \\( S \\) sums to 10.\n\n- Since the only subset with maximum element 5 is those containing 5, determine which \\( T \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\) make \\( S \\) satisfy the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Analyze subsets \\( T \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\)**\n\n- For each \\( T \\), check whether any subset of \\( S = T \\cup \\{5\\} \\), other than \\( S \\) itself, sums to 10.\n\n- Since 5 is included, subsets that include 5:\n\n    - Single-element subset: only \\(\\{5\\}\\), sum = 5 ≠ 10.\n\n    - Subsets including 5 and elements of \\( T \\).\n\n- But the only concern is whether any subset summing to 10 exists.\n\n- The presence of 5 reduces the size of subset sums needed to reach 10.\n\n- Let's check whether any subset of \\( T \\cup \\{5\\} \\) sums to 10, with the subset size ≥ 1.\n\n- Since larger subsets are less restrictive, check:\n\n    * Subsets containing 5 and other elements:\n\n        - For any subset, sum = sum(elements) including 5.\n\n- Particularly, the subset including 5 and some elements \\(X \\subseteq T\\).\n\n- Sum is \\( 5 + \\sum X \\).\n\n- To sum to 10, need \\( 5 + \\sum X = 10 \\Rightarrow \\sum X=5 \\).\n\n- So, for any subset \\( S' \\) with 5 and some elements of \\( T \\), the sum is 10 if and only if \\(\\sum X=5\\).\n\n- Therefore, the crucial condition:\n\n    - \\( S' \\) contains 5 and some subset \\( X \\subseteq T \\), with \\( \\sum X=5 \\).\n\n    - To avoid sum 10 in any subset, \\( T \\) must not have any subset summing to 5.\n\n- In particular, the problem reduces to:\n\n    **For each \\( T \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\), if \\( T \\) contains a subset summing to 5, then \\( T \\cup \\{5\\} \\) contains a subset summing to 10, which violates the condition.**\n\n- Also, check other subsets (without 5):\n\n    - Subsets with only elements of \\( T \\):\n\n        - If any subset sums to 10, that subset alone sums to 10, which violates the condition.\n\n    - Since the problem states that no subset of \\( S \\) sums to 10, including subsets not containing 5.\n\n- So, the key restrictions:\n\n    - \\( T \\) itself must not contain any subset summing to 10.\n\n    - \\( T \\) must not contain any subset summing to 5 (since then, \\( T \\) itself sums to 5, but not necessarily to 10; but the overall subset could produce a subset sum of 10 if combined with 5).\n\n- Let's analyze:\n\n    - The only potential cause of sum 10 is:\n\n        * when the subset includes 5 and \\( X \\subseteq T \\) with sum 5, since \\( 5 + 5=10 \\).\n\n    - So, if \\( T \\) contains a subset summing to 5, then the subset with 5 and that subset sums to 10 → not allowed.\n\n    - Also, directly, if \\( T \\) contains a subset of sum 10, this will make \\( T \\) itself violate the condition.\n\n    - When \\( T \\) has subset sum of 5, the combined subset with 5 sums to 10 → forbidden.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- For each \\( T \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\):\n\n    - \\( T \\) must not have any subset summing to 5.\n\n    - \\( T \\) must not have any subset summing to 10.\n\n- Also, note that:\n\n    - Since elements are from 1 to 4, the subset sums:\n\n        * minimal sum: 1 (if \\( T \\) contains 1)\n\n        * maximum sum: sum of all elements \\( 1+2+3+4=10 \\)\n\n- To avoid sum 10, check if any subset sums to 10.\n\n- To avoid sum 5, check no subset sums to 5.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Find all \\( T \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\) with no subset summing to 5 or 10**\n\nLet's list all subsets \\( T \\), then eliminate those with subset sum 5 or 10.\n\n- Include the empty set (since it doesn't violate conditions):\n\n    - \\( T = \\emptyset \\):\n\n        - No subset sum, so valid.\n\n- Subsets with one element:\n\n    - \\( \\{1\\} \\): sums: 1 → OK\n\n    - \\( \\{2\\} \\): sum 2 → OK\n\n    - \\( \\{3\\} \\): sum 3 → OK\n\n    - \\( \\{4\\} \\): sum 4 → OK\n\n- Subsets with two elements:\n\n    - \\( \\{1,2\\} \\): sum 3 → OK\n\n    - \\( \\{1,3\\} \\): sum 4 → OK\n\n    - \\( \\{1,4\\} \\): sum 5 → violates the no sum 5 condition → exclude\n\n    - \\( \\{2,3\\} \\): sum 5 → exclude\n\n    - \\( \\{2,4\\} \\): sum 6 → OK\n\n    - \\( \\{3,4\\} \\): sum 7 → OK\n\n- Subsets with three elements:\n\n    - \\( \\{1,2,3\\} \\): sum 6 → OK\n\n    - \\( \\{1,2,4\\} \\): sum 7 → OK\n\n    - \\( \\{1,3,4\\} \\): sum 8 → OK\n\n    - \\( \\{2,3,4\\} \\): sum 9 → OK\n\n- Subset with four elements:\n\n    - \\( \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\): sum 10 → violates sum 10 condition → exclude\n\n**Remaining valid \\( T \\) sets:**\n\n- \\( \\emptyset \\)\n\n- \\( \\{1\\} \\)\n\n- \\( \\{2\\} \\)\n\n- \\( \\{3\\} \\)\n\n- \\( \\{4\\} \\)\n\n- \\( \\{1,2\\} \\)\n\n- \\( \\{1,3\\} \\)\n\n- \\( \\{2,4\\} \\)\n\n- \\( \\{3,4\\} \\)\n\n- \\( \\{1,2,3\\} \\)\n\n- \\( \\{1,2,4\\} \\)\n\n- \\( \\{1,3,4\\} \\)\n\n- \\( \\{2,3,4\\} \\)\n\nTotal of 13 such \\( T \\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Count the subsets \\( S = T \\cup \\{5\\} \\)**\n\nEach valid \\( T \\) corresponds to exactly one \\( S \\). Since the question asks for \\( N_5 \\): the number of such subsets with largest element 5 satisfying the condition, i.e., the number of such \\( S \\).\n\n- For each \\( T \\), the subset \\( S = T \\cup \\{5\\} \\).\n\n- Since all these \\( T \\)'s are without subset sum 5 or 10, \\( S \\) will satisfy the no-sum-10 condition.\n\n- The only subset to exclude is the one where \\( T = \\emptyset \\), \\( S = \\{5\\} \\). Is that subset valid?\n\n    * Subset \\( \\{5\\} \\): sum 5 ≠ 10, no problem.\n\n    * Subset sum 10? No, only sum 5, so it's valid.\n\n- Therefore, all 13 \\( T \\)'s yield valid \\( S \\).\n\nThus, **\\( N_5 = 13 \\).**\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Compute \\( k = N_5 - 8 \\)**\n\n\\[\nk = 13 - 8 = 5\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Step 8: Solve for the number of triples \\((a, b, c)\\)** satisfying:\n\n\\[\n(ab + k)(bc + k)(ca + k) = 84\n\\]\n\nwith \\( k=5 \\).\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(ab + 5)(bc + 5)(ca + 5) = 84\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Step 9: Factorization of 84**\n\n- Prime factorization:\n\n\\[\n84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\n\n- The factors are positive integers. Since \\( a, b, c \\ge 0 \\), the expressions \\( ab + 5 \\), \\( bc + 5 \\), \\( ca + 5 \\) are at least 5 (when \\( a, b, c \\geq 0 \\)).\n\n- Therefore, all three factors are integers ≥ 5.\n\n- The minimal value of each factor is 5 (when \\( a, b, c \\ge 0 \\)), so we look for factorizations of 84 into three integers each ≥5.\n\n---\n\n**Step 10: Find all triplets \\((X, Y, Z)\\) with:**\n\n\\[\nX = ab + 5, \\quad Y = bc + 5, \\quad Z= ca + 5,\n\\]\n\nsuch that:\n\n\\[\nXYZ = 84,\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\na, b, c \\ge 0.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( a, b, c \\ge 0 \\), then:\n\n\\[\nab = X - 5 \\ge 0, \\quad bc = Y - 5 \\ge 0, \\quad ca= Z - 5 \\ge 0,\n\\]\n\nso all differences are non-negative.\n\n---\n\n**Step 11: List factorizations of 84 into three integers each ≥ 5**\n\nPossible triplet factorizations:\n\n- \\( 84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 21 \\), but 2 < 5 → invalid.\n\n- \\( 84 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 14 \\), 2<5 → invalid.\n\n- \\( 84= 2 \\times 6 \\times 7 \\), 2<5 → invalid, but 6,7 ≥5.\n\nSimilarly, check all permutations:\n\n- \\( 6 \\times 7 \\times 2 \\)\n\n- \\( 6 \\times 14 \\times 1 \\), but 1<5 → invalid.\n\n- \\( 4 \\times 21 \\times 1 \\)\n\nOnly look at triplets with all factors ≥5:\n\n- \\( 7 \\times 6 \\times 2 \\): 2<5 → discard.\n\n- \\( 7 \\times 12 \\times 1. \\) No.\n\nAlternative: Let's systematically identify all triplets with all factors ≥5:\n\nFactors of 84:\n\n- \\(84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\)\n\nPossible factors ≥5:\n\n- 5? No, 5 doesn't divide 84.\n\nThus, other factorization:\n\n- \\( 84 = 6 \\times 14 \\times 1 \\), but 1<5.\n\n- \\( 84= 7 \\times 12 \\times 1 \\), 1<5.\n\n- \\( 12 \\times 7 \\times 1 \\), same.\n\n- \\( 14 \\times 6 \\times 2 \\), 2<5.\n\n- \\( 21 \\times 4 \\times 1 \\), 4<5.\n\n- \\( 28 \\times 3 \\times 1 \\), 3<5.\n\n- \\( 84 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\), only one.\n\nIt appears no triplet with all factors ≥5 divides 84, unless factors equal 6,7, etc., but the only factors ≥5 with product dividing 84 are:\n\n- \\( 6 \\times 14 \\times 1 \\): no, 1<5.\n\n- \\( 7 \\times 12 \\times 1 \\): no, 1<5.\n\n- \\( 12 \\times 7 \\times 1 \\): same.\n\n- \\( 14 \\times 6 \\times 1 \\): same.\n\n- \\( 21 \\times 4 \\times 1 \\): 4<5.\n\n- \\( 28 \\times 3 \\times 1 \\): 3<5.\n\nRecall that \\( a, b, c \\ge 0 \\), which implies that:\n\n\\( ab = X - 5 \\ge 0 \\Rightarrow X \\ge 5 \\),\nSimilarly for \\( Y, Z \\).\n\n- Since they are factors of 84, and each ≥5, the only possible triplet is:\n\n\\[\nX = 7, \\quad Y=12, \\quad Z=1. \\quad \\text{No, one is less than 5.}\n\\]\n\nBut we need all factors ≥5.\n\nCandidate factors:\n\n- 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84.\n\nCheck possible bounds:\n\n- \\( 84 / 5 = 16.8 \\).

The product of three factors each ≥5 is at least \\( 5^3 = 125 \\), which is > 84.\n\nBut that contradicts the original product. So the only way is some factors being less than 5? They are, but the earlier assumption was that \\( ab + 5 \\ge 5 \\), so that is trivial.\n\nIn the problem, the factors are:\n\n- \\( X=ab+5 \\ge 5 \\)\n- \\( Y=bc+5 \\ge 5 \\)\n- \\( Z=ca+5 \\ge 5 \\)\n\n- The minimal value of each is 5 (when \\(ab=0\\), etc.).\n\n- The product is 84, which is less than \\(125\\). So, at least one factor must be less than 5 for the product to be smaller.\n\nBut earlier, we established that all factors are ≥5.\n\n**Contradiction:**\n\n- No triplet of integers ≥5 can multiply to 84.\n\n- Therefore, the only possibility is that at least one of the factors is less than 5: which contradicts previous assumption.\n\nAlternatively, check for factors less than 5:\n\n- Factors are positive integers ≥1.\n\n- The factors \\( ab+5 \\), etc., are ≥5.\n\n- Since the product is 84, and each factor ≥5, the minimal total product is 125; but 84 <125, so impossible.\n\nHence, **there are no solutions**.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\nThe only solution is **no triples \\((a, b, c)\\)** satisfy the equation.\n\n**Thus, the total number of solutions is 0.**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"0\"\n}\n```",
