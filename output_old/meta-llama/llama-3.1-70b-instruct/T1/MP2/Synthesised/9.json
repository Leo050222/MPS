  "math_problem": "Consider the following flowchart: INPUT $\\rightarrow$ Subtract $8 \\rightarrow \\square \\rightarrow$ Divide by $2 \\rightarrow \\square$ Add $16 \\rightarrow$ OUTPUT. If the OUTPUT is 32, what was the INPUT? Instead of determining the initial input value that produces the specified output via the flowchart's sequence of operations, simply find $k = A - 26$, where $A$ is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step. What is the $y$-intercept of the line $y = x + 4$ after it is translated down $k$ units?",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. The flowchart's sequence:\n   - Input → Subtract 8 → ? (denote as A) → Divide by 2 → ? (denote as B) → Add 16 → Output\n\n2. The final output is 32. So, working backwards:\n   - Output = B + 16 = 32\n   - B = 32 - 16 = 16\n\n3. B is the result of dividing A by 2:\n   - B = A / 2\n   - 16 = A / 2\n   - A = 16 × 2 = 32\n\n4. A is obtained after subtracting 8 from the input (call the input X):\n   - A = X - 8\n   - 32 = X - 8\n   - X = 32 + 8 = 40\n\n5. The problem asks to find k = A - 26:\n   - A = 32\n   - k = 32 - 26 = 6\n\n6. Next, determine the y-intercept of the line y = x + 4 after translating down k units:\n   - Original line: y = x + 4\n   - Translated down k units: y = x + 4 - k\n   - Since k = 6: y = x + 4 - 6 = x - 2\n   - The y-intercept of y = x - 2 is when x = 0: y = 0 - 2 = -2\n\nFinal answer to the question about the y-intercept is -2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"-2\"\n}\n```",
