  "math_problem": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$. Shuxin begins with $d$ red candies, 7 yellow candies, and 3 blue candies. After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining. What is the smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate?",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Find the scale factor \\(k\\) for the skateboards and bicycles:\n- The ratio of skateboards to bicycles is \\(7:4\\).\n- The total skateboards: \\(7k\\).\n- The total bicycles: \\(4k\\).\n\n### Step 2: Use the given difference:\n- The difference between skateboards and bicycles is 12.\n- \\(7k - 4k = 12 \\Rightarrow 3k = 12 \\Rightarrow k = 4\\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the total count:\n- Skateboards: \\(7k = 7 \\times 4 = 28\\).\n- Bicycles: \\(4k = 4 \\times 4 = 16\\).\n\n### Step 4: Find \\(d = k + 6\\):\n- \\(d = 4 + 6 = 10\\).\n\n---\n\n### Now, analyze the candies problem:\n\nShuxin starts with:\n- \\(d = 10\\) red candies,\n- 7 yellow candies,\n- 3 blue candies.\n\nTotal initial candies:\n- Red: 10\n- Yellow: 7\n- Blue: 3\n\n### Step 5: After some candies are eaten:\n- Remaining candies of each color are equal.\n- Let \\(r, y, b\\) be the remaining red, yellow, and blue candies.\n- \\(r = y = b\\).\n\n### Step 6: Find the minimum candies eaten:\n- Candies eaten: \\(\\text{initial} - \\text{remaining}\\).\n- Remaining candies: \\(r\\) for each color.\n- Since \\(r \\leq 10\\) (red), \\(r \\leq 7\\) (yellow), \\(r \\leq 3\\) (blue).\n\nThus, the maximum \\(r\\) is limited by the smallest initial count (blue), which is 3.\n\n### Step 7: Determine \\(r\\):\n- \\(r = 3\\) (smallest possible to ensure all are equal).\n\n### Step 8: Calculate candies eaten:\n- Red candies eaten: \\(10 - 3 = 7\\).\n- Yellow candies eaten: \\(7 - 3 = 4\\).\n- Blue candies eaten: \\(3 - 3 = 0\\).\n\nTotal candies eaten:\n- \\(7 + 4 + 0 = 11\\).\n\n---\n\n### Final answers:\n- \\(d = 10\\),\n- Total candies eaten: 11,\n- The question asks for the smallest possible candies eaten, which is 11.\n\nBut the question explicitly states to provide the answer in the JSON format, and the problem is centered on the candies eaten.\n\nThe total candies eaten is **11**.\n\n---\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
