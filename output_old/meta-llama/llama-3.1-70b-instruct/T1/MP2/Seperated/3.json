  "reasoning_content": "Let's solve each problem step by step:\n\n**Problem 1:** Solve for \\( 2d \\) if \\( 10d + 8 = 528 \\).\n\n1. Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( d \\):\n   \\( 10d = 528 - 8 \\)\n   \\( 10d = 520 \\)\n\n2. Divide both sides by 10 to solve for \\( d \\):\n   \\( d = \\frac{520}{10} \\)\n   \\( d = 52 \\)\n\n3. Find \\( 2d \\):\n   \\( 2d = 2 \\times 52 = 104 \\)\n\n**Problem 2:** Megan's speed is \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\) m/s, and the total distance is 100 m.\n\n- Time taken by Megan to complete 100 m:\n  \\( t_{Megan} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{100}{\\frac{5}{4}} \\)\n  - Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal:\n  \\( t_{Megan} = 100 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 80 \\) seconds\n\n- Hana's car finished 5 seconds before Megan:\n  \\( t_{Hana} = t_{Megan} - 5 = 80 - 5 = 75 \\) seconds\n\n- Speed of Hana's car:\n  \\( v_{Hana} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} = \\frac{100}{75} = \\frac{4}{3} \\)\n\n**Final answers:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Solve for d: 10d + 8 = 528 subtract 8: 10d=520 divide by 10: d=52 multiply by 2: 2d=104.
