  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To maximize the product x*y given x + y = 31 with positive integers, we note that for a fixed sum, the product is maximized when x and y are as close as possible. Since 31 is odd, the closest integers are 15 and 16, giving a product of 15*16 = 240. Problem 2: The line segment joins points (-9,-2) and (6,8). The slope m = (8 - (-2)) / (6 - (-9)) = 10 / 15 = 2/3. Using the point-slope form, the line's equation is y + 2 = (2/3)(x + 9). Simplify: y = (2/3)x + 6 - 2 = (2/3)x + 4. To find integer points, x must be such that (2/3)x is integer, meaning x must be divisible by 3. x ranges from -9 to 6: x in {-9, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6}. Corresponding y-values are: for x=-9, y= (2/3)(-9)+4 = -6+4 = -2; for x=-6, y= -4+4=0; for x=-3, y= -2+4=2; for x=0, y=4; for x=3, y=6; for x=6, y=8. All these points are on the segment (they satisfy the endpoints). Total points: 6.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"240\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
