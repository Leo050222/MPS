  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The sale price after a 20% discount is \\$112, which means that \\$112 is 80% of the original price. Let the original price be P. Then, 0.8 * P = 112, so P = 112 / 0.8 = 140. For a 30% discount off the original price, the sale price would be 70% of the original price, which is 0.7 * 140 = 98. \\n\\nProblem 2: The quadratic expression is (x + m)(x + n) which expands to x^2 + (m + n)x + m * n. The constant term is m * n = -12. The sum m + n appears in the linear term but does not affect the constant term directly. Since m and n are integers and their product is -12, the possible integer pairs (m, n) are: (1, -12), (-1, 12), (2, -6), (-2, 6), (3, -4), (-3, 4). The sum m + n for these pairs are: -11, 11, -4, 4, -1, 1, respectively. Therefore, the possible values of m are the m in these pairs, which are 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3. The question asks which value cannot be a value of m. Since all these are possible values of m, the only value not possible is any integer outside this set. But the question is incomplete without options. Assuming the options correspond to these sets, and given the context, the value that cannot be m is any number not in {±1, ±2, ±3}. Since no specific options are given here, we can deduce that possible m are from the set {1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3}. The only m that cannot be a value (assuming options are the pairs above) would be any integer outside this set, for example, 0. Therefore, the value that cannot be m is 0.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"98\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"0\"\n}",
