  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, convert the data stored from MB to GB: 300000 MB ÷ 1024 = approximately 292.96875 GB. The total capacity is 300 GB, so remaining space = 300 - 292.96875 = approximately 7.03125 GB. For Problem 2, calculate discount prices: Bicycle discount = 20% of 320 = 64, sale price = 320 - 64 = 256. Helmet discount = 10% of 80 = 8, sale price = 80 - 8 = 72. Total savings = (original total) - (sale total) = (320 + 80) - (256 + 72) = 400 - 328 = 72. Percentage savings = (savings / original total) * 100 = (72 / 400) * 100 = 18%.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"7.03125\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"18\"\n}",
