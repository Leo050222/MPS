  "reasoning_content": "Let's carefully analyze the problem step by step, focusing on the key parts of the question and relevant mathematical concepts.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the functional equation and periodicity\nGiven:\n- \\(f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\{0,1,\\ldots,16\\}\\)\n- \\(f(x+17) = f(x)\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\)\n\nThis implies that \\(f\\) is periodic with period 17, so the problem reduces to defining \\(f\\) on the finite set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 17\\}\\), with the understanding that \\(f(n+17)=f(n)\\).\n\n### Step 2: The second condition\n\\[\nf(x^2) \\equiv f(x)^2 + 15 \\pmod{17}\n\\]\nfor all \\(x \\geq 1\\).\n\nSince \\(f\\) is periodic mod 17, for \\(x\\) whose residue mod 17 is \\(r\\), the value \\(f(x)\\) depends only on \\(r\\). Define \\(g(r) := f(r)\\) for \\(r \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 17\\}\\).\n\nThe functional equation becomes:\n\\[\nf(r^2) = f(r)^2 + 15 \\pmod{17}\n\\]\nfor \\(r = 1, 2, \\ldots, 17\\), with the understanding that the squaring is modulo 17.\n\n### Step 3: The quadratic map over \\(\\mathbb{Z}/17\\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- The map \\(r \\mapsto r^2 \\pmod{17}\\) is well-defined on the set \\(\\{1, \\ldots, 17\\}\\).\n- The nature of quadratic residues modulo 17 is well-known: exactly half the non-zero elements are quadratic residues, and 1 is always a quadratic residue.\n\nListing quadratic residues mod 17:\n\nSquares modulo 17:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n1^2 &\\equiv 1 \\\\\n2^2 &\\equiv 4 \\\\\n3^2 &\\equiv 9 \\\\\n4^2 &\\equiv 16 \\\\\n5^2 &\\equiv 8 \\\\\n6^2 &\\equiv 2 \\\\\n7^2 &\\equiv 15 \\\\\n8^2 &\\equiv 13 \\\\\n9^2 &\\equiv 13 \\\\\n10^2 &\\equiv 15 \\\\\n11^2 &\\equiv 2 \\\\\n12^2 &\\equiv 8 \\\\\n13^2 &\\equiv 16 \\\\\n14^2 &\\equiv 9 \\\\\n15^2 &\\equiv 4 \\\\\n16^2 &\\equiv 1 \\\\\n17^2 &\\equiv 1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nQuadratic residues are: \\(\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16\\}\\).\n\nNote:\n- When \\(r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{17}\\), \\(r^2 \\equiv 0\\). But since \\(r\\) runs over \\(\\{1,\\ldots,17\\}\\), and \\(17 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{17}\\), this gives \\(r=17\\) corresponding to zero residue.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Assignments under the functional equation\nThe key is to analyze the possible values based on the functional equation:\n\\[\nf(r^2) \\equiv f(r)^2 + 15 \\pmod{17}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(r\\) with \\(r^2 \\equiv s \\pmod{17}\\),\n\\[\ng(s) = g(r^2) = g(r)^2 + 15 \\pmod{17}\n\\]\n\nGiven the map, the values \\(g(r)\\) must satisfy:\n- For each \\(r\\), \\(g(r^2) = g(r)^2 + 15\\)\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Find consistent assignments\nOur main goal is to examine the \"structure of the preimage tree\" and the \"recurrence sequence\". The problem asks specifically about \\(a_2\\), which relates to the second term in a sequence counting value assignments in the preimage tree, in a case where the root assignment does **not** force all internal nodes to the same value.\n\n- The recurrence nature indicates possible branching structures.\n- Since no specific root assignment is specified, and the key equation involves the square map modulo 17, we are to analyze cycles and fixed points.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Connect to the behavior of \\(f\\) over the reals\nThe last sentence states:\n> \"Let \\(f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) be a function satisfying \\(f(x)f(y)=f(x-y)\\). Find all possible values of \\(f(a_2 + 2012)\\).\"\n\nThis is a separate functional equation with known solutions:\n\\[\nf(x)f(y) = f(x - y)\n\\]\nThis is a standard functional equation, whose solutions are well-understood:\n\n- \\(f(x) \\equiv 0\\) (the zero function)\n- \\(f(x) \\equiv 1\\) (the constant unit function)\n- \\(f(x) = c^{x}\\) for some constant \\(c\\), in particular, if \\(f\\) is continuous and defined over reals.\n\nFrom the properties of such functions, solutions are:\n\n- \\(f \\equiv 0\\),\n- \\(f \\equiv 1\\),\n- \\(f(x) = e^{k x}\\) with \\(f(x)f(y)=f(x-y)\\) implies \\(f(x) = e^{k x}\\) where \\(e^{k (x + y)} = e^{k x} e^{k y}\\).\n\nBut, because \\(f\\) also satisfies \\(f(x)f(y) = f(x-y)\\), the solutions are:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad f(x) = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad f(x) = c^{x},\n\\]\nbut only the trivial solutions \\(f \\equiv 0\\) or \\(f \\equiv 1\\) satisfy the equation for all \\(x, y\\).\n\nNote that:\n- For \\(f \\equiv 0\\), \\(f(a_2+2012)=0\\).\n- For \\(f \\equiv 1\\), \\(f(a_2+2012)=1\\).\n\nThe intermediate solutions \\(f(x) = c^x\\) only satisfy the functional equation if \\(c\\) is such that \\(c^x c^y = c^{x-y}\\). That implies \\(c^{x + y} = c^{x - y}\\), so \\(c^{2 y} = 1\\) for all \\(y\\), hence \\(c^{2 y} = 1\\) always; in characteristic zero, this restricts \\(c\\) to be \\(1\\) or \\(-1\\). But \\(f\\equiv c^{x}\\) isn't necessarily defined for all real \\(x\\). Usually, the solutions over reals are only the constant functions \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), for simplicity.\n\nThus, the possible values for \\(f(a_2 + 2012)\\) are \\(0\\) or \\(1\\).\n\n---\n\n### Final Step: Determine the exact value\nThe question asks for \\(f(a_2 + 2012)\\). Given the set of solutions, and the nature of the problem, likely the function \\(f\\) is either constant 0 or 1 (or possibly a solution of the exponential form), but the standard, clearly continuous solutions are \\(0\\), \\(1\\).\n\nSince the problem does not specify which, but asks to \"find all possible values,\" the possible values are \\(\\boxed{0}\\) and \\(\\boxed{1}\\).\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\nBased on the analysis, the possible values of \\(f(a_2 + 2012)\\) are 0 and 1.\n\n---\n\n### JSON formatting:\nThe problem's final instruction is to give the answer in JSON, with only the answer value, in a string, representing the set of possible values.\n\n**However, as per the specific rules, only a single answer should be provided. Since the question is \"find all possible values,\" a typical interpretation would be to list the set: \\{0,1\\} or specify one of those.**\n\nGiven the format, the most appropriate single value is to specify the set of possible values.\n\n---\n\n### Final output:\n```json\n{\n    \"answer\": \"[0, 1]\"\n}\n```",
