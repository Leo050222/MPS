  "math_problem": "Find all positive integers $n, k_1, \\dots, k_n$ such that $k_1 + \\cdots + k_n = 5n-4$ and \\[ \\frac{1}{k_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{k_n} = 1. \\] Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ and corresponding $k_1, \\dots, k_n$ satisfying the sum and reciprocal sum conditions, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the part size in the solution with the smallest possible $n$, derived from the structural consideration of minimal number of terms in the representation. Alice and Bob play a game on a board consisting of one row of $k + 2021$ consecutive squares. They take turns placing tiles that cover two adjacent squares, with Alice going first. By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule. Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends; Bob's goal is to minimize it. What is the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure at the end of the game, no matter how Bob plays?",
