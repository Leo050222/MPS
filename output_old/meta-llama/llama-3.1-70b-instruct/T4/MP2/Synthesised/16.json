There are arbitrary 7 points in the plane. Circles are drawn through every $k$ possible concyclic points. Find the maximum number of circles that can be drawn.",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze the functional equation step-by-step:\n\nGiven:  \n\\[f(x + y^2) = f(x) + |y f(y)|\\]\n\nStep 1: Find \\( f(0) \\):\nSet \\( x = 0 \\):\n\\[f(y^2) = f(0) + | y f(y) |\\]\n\nLet \\( y = 0 \\):\n\\[f(0) = f(0) + |0 \\cdot f(0)| \\Rightarrow 0 = 0\\]\nThis gives no new information.\n\nStep 2: Find \\( f(0) \\) in terms of other values:\nFrom the equation with \\( x=0 \\):\n\\[f(y^2) = f(0) + | y f(y) |\\]\nIn particular, set \\( y = 1 \\):\n\\[f(1) = f(0) + |f(1)|\\]\nNote that:\n\\[\nf(1) = f(0) + |f(1)|\n\\]\n\n- If \\( f(1) \\geq 0 \\), then:\n\\[f(1) = f(0) + f(1) \\Rightarrow f(0) = 0\\]\n- If \\( f(1) < 0 \\), then:\n\\[f(1) = f(0) - f(1) \\Rightarrow 2f(1) = f(0)\\]\nSince \\( f(1) < 0 \\), \\( f(0) \\) must also be negative.\n\nStep 3: Deduce possible \\( f(0) \\):\nSuppose \\( f(0) = c \\).\n\nFrom the previous step, for \\( y \\neq 0 \\),\n\\[f(y^2) = c + | y f(y) |\\]\nSet \\( y = 1 \\):\n\\[f(1) = c + |f(1)|\\]\n\n- Case 1: \\(f(1) \\geq 0\\)\n\n\\[\nf(1) = c + f(1) \\Rightarrow c=0\n\\]\n\n- Case 2: \\(f(1) < 0\\)\n\n\\[\nf(1) = c - f(1) \\Rightarrow 2f(1)= c\n\\]\nGiven \\(f(1)<0\\), then \\( c < 0 \\).\n\nBut from the first case, when \\( c=0 \\), the relation simplifies to:\n\n\\[f(1) = 0 + |f(1)|\\]\nwhich implies \\(f(1) \\geq 0\\), and for the relation to hold, no contradiction arises.\n\nSimilarly, for the general \\( y \\), with \\( c=0 \\):\n\n\\[f(y^2) = | y f(y) |\\]\n\nStep 4: Explore potential solutions:\nSuppose \\( f(y) \\equiv 0 \\), then:\n\n\\[f(x + y^2) = 0 = 0 + | y \\cdot 0 | = 0 \\]\nwhich satisfies the equation for all \\( x,y\\). So \\(f \\equiv 0\\) is a solution, with \\(f(0)=0\\), thus \\(k=f(0)+4=4\\).\n\nNow consider if \\(f(y)\\) could be proportional to \\( y \\), say \\(f(y)=a y\\):\n\n\\[f(x + y^2) = a (x + y^2) = a x + a y^2\\]\n\nAnd the right side:\n\n\\[f(x) + | y f(y)| = a x + | y \\cdot a y | = a x + | a y^2 | = a x + | a | y^2 \\]\n\nThus we need:\n\n\\[a x + a y^2 = a x + |a| y^2\\]\n\nwhich implies:\n\n\\[a y^2 = |a| y^2 \\Rightarrow a= |a| \\Rightarrow a \\geq 0 \\]\n\nSo, \\( f(y) = a y \\), with \\( a \\geq 0 \\), are solutions.\n\n**Check the solution \\(f(y) = a y\\):**\n\n- For \\(a=0\\), the zero function, solution as above.\n- For \\(a>0\\), then:\n\n\\[f(x + y^2) = a x + a y^2\\]\nand\n\n\\[f(x) + | y f(y)| = a x + | y \\cdot a y|= a x + a y^2\\]\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAdditionally, check the value at \\(0\\):\n\n\\[f(0) = a \\cdot 0 = 0 \\Rightarrow k = f(0) + 4 = 4\\]\n\n**Summary of solutions:**\n\n- Zero function: \\(f \\equiv 0\\), \\(f(0) = 0 \\Rightarrow k=4\\)\n- Linear functions: \\(f(y) = a y \\), \\(a \\geq 0\\), \\(f(0)=0 \\Rightarrow k=4\\)\n\nHence, in all the solutions, \\(f(0) = 0\\), which implies:\n\n\\[k = f(0) + 4 = 4\\]\n\n---\n\nNow, given the problem about points and circles:\n\n- There are 7 arbitrary points in the plane.\n- The maximum number of circles passing through every possible \\(k\\) concyclic points.\n\nThe maximum number of circles passing through given points occurs when the points are arranged so that each set of 3 points is non-collinear, and each circle is uniquely determined by 3 points.\n\nSince all points are arbitrary and only the maximum number of circles passing through all \\(k\\) points are considered, and \\(k\\) is given as \\(f(0)+4\\), which we found to be 4, then:\n\n- The maximum number of circles passing through 4 points (general position) is the number of 4-point subsets, but a circle is determined uniquely by 3 non-collinear points.\n\nGiven the statement: \"maximum number of circles that can be drawn through every \\(k\\) possible concyclic points,\" interpreting as:\n\n- The maximum number of circles through \\(k\\) points is \\(\\binom{k}{3}\\).\n\nBut as per the problem's context, the critical part is that \\(k=4\\), since the functional analysis suggests \\(f(0)=0\\), so:\n\n\\[\nk = 4\n\\]\n\nFinal step: providing the answer.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"answer\": \"4\"\n}\n```",
