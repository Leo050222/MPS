Set \\(x=0\\):\n\\[f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)|.\\]\nDefine \\(c = f(0)\\). Then,\n\\[f(y^2) = c + |y f(y)|.\\]\n\n2. Since \\(f(y^2)\\) depends only on \\(y^2\\), it's natural to examine the behavior for positive and negative \\(y\\). For simplicity, define \\(g(y) := f(y)\\), and note \\(f\\) is from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\n3. Consider \\(y=0\\):\n\\[f(0+0^2) = f(0) + |0 \\cdot f(0)| \\implies f(0) = f(0) + 0.\\]\nThis gives no new information.\n\n4. For \\(y \\neq 0\\):\n\\[f(y^2) = c + | y f(y)|.\\]\nObserve that \\(f(y^2)\\) depends only on \\(y^2\\). Also, \\(f(y^2) \\equiv f\\) evaluated at a nonnegative argument.\n\n5. Let's analyze the possible forms:\n\n- Suppose \\(f\\) is linear: \\(f(x) = m x + d\\).\n\nTest for \\(f(x) = m x + d\\):\n\nFrom the original functional equation:\n\\[f(x + y^2) = m(x + y^2) + d,\\]\nand\n\\[f(x) + | y f(y) | = m x + d + | y (m y + d) | = m x + d + | m y^2 + d y |.\\]\n\nSet equal:\n\\[m x + m y^2 + d = m x + d + | m y^2 + d y |\\]\n\\[\\Rightarrow m y^2 = | m y^2 + d y |\\]\n\nBecause this must hold for all \\(y\\):\n\n- When \\(y=0\\), both sides are 0.\n- For general \\(y\\), analyze:\n\\[m y^2 = | m y^2 + d y |\\]\n\nThis must be true for all \\(y\\). \n\nNote:\n\n- If \\(d=0\\), then \\(f(x) = m x\\).\n\nTest \\(f(x)= m x\\):\n\n\\[f(x + y^2) = m(x + y^2) = m x + m y^2.\\]\nRight side:\n\\[f(x) + | y f(y) | = m x + | y (m y) | = m x + | m y^2 | = m x + | m | y^2.\\]\n\nSet equal:\n\\[m x + m y^2 = m x + | m | y^2 \\implies m y^2 = | m | y^2.\\]\n\nSince this must hold for all \\(y\\), it implies:\n\n\\[\nm y^2 = | m | y^2 \\Rightarrow m = | m |.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(m \\geq 0\\). So, \\(f(x) = m x\\) with \\(m \\geq 0\\).\n\nNow, check the consistency:\n\n- For \\(f(x) = m x\\) with \\(m \\geq 0\\),\n\\[\nf(x + y^2) = m (x + y^2) = m x + m y^2,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nf(x) + | y f(y) | = m x + | y (m y) | = m x + | m | y^2 = m x + m y^2,\n\\]\nwhich matches. \n\n- For \\(d \\neq 0\\), fixing \\(y=1\\):\n\\[f(y^2) = c + | y f(y)| \\Rightarrow f(1) = c + | f(1)| \\Rightarrow f(1) = c + |f(1)|.\\]\nBut \\(f(1) = m \\cdot 1 + d = m + d\\), and \\(c= f(0) = d\\), so:\n\\[m + d = d + | m + d |\\]\n\\[\\Rightarrow m = | m + d |\\]\n\nSince \\(m \\geq 0\\):\n\n- If \\(m + d \\geq 0\\), then \\(m = m + d \\Rightarrow d=0\\).\n\n- If \\(m + d < 0\\), then \\(m = - (m + d) \\Rightarrow m = -m - d \\Rightarrow 2m = -d\\).\n\nBut earlier, for the function to hold everywhere, and to satisfy the key functional equation, the only consistent solutions are with \\(d=0\\), thus returning to the linear solutions \\(f(x) = m x\\) with \\(m \\geq 0\\).\n\n**Existence of solutions:**\n\n- \\(f(x) = 0\\) (complete zero function): check\n\\[\nf(x + y^2) = 0,\\quad f(x)+| y f(y)| = 0 + 0 = 0,\n\\]\nwhich works.\n\n- \\(f(x) = m x\\) with \\(m \\geq 0\\).\n\n**Are there any other solutions?**\n\nAny non-linear or discontinuous solutions would be difficult because the functional form strongly constrains the relation. The previous analysis suggests the solutions are exactly the linear functions \\(f(x) = m x\\) with \\(m \\ge 0\\).\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\nThe functions \\(f:\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}\\) satisfying the functional equation are\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\nf(x) = m x \\text{ for some } m \\geq 0.\n}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2: Count of circles through 4 points**\n\nGiven 7 points in the plane, circles be drawn through every possible 4 points.\n\nNumber of 4-point subsets:\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{4} = 35.\n\\]\n\nDifferent sets of 4 points can define the same circle if the points are concyclic and coincide with other 4-point subsets.\n\nThe maximum number of distinct circles corresponds to arrangements where no three points are collinear and no 5 or more points are concyclic (to maximize the count).\n\nSince each set of 4 points uniquely determines a circle in general position (no special degeneracies), the maximum number of distinct circles passing through exactly 4 of the 7 points is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\binom{7}{4} = 35}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final JSON:**\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The functional equation analysis shows that the solutions are linear functions f(x)=m x with m >= 0. The count of circles through 4 points among 7 points is maximized when all 4-point subsets determine distinct circles, which occurs in general position with no special degeneracies, giving a total of C(7,4)=35.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"m x with m >= 0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"35\"\n}",
