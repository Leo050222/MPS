By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule. Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends; Bob's goal is to minimize it.

The structure indicates that the only solution is for \\( n=1 \\).\n\n**Conclusion for Problem 1:**\n\n- The only solution is \\( n=1 \\), \\( k_1=1 \\).\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\n- The game involves 2022 squares, with players placing 2-square tiles alternately, Alice first.\n- Each placed tile covers 2 adjacent uncovered squares.\n- The game ends when no more tiles can be placed.\n- Alice wants to maximize the number of uncovered squares remaining.\n\n**Step 1: Model the problem**\n\n- Total squares: 2022.\n- Alice and Bob alternatively place tiles covering exactly 2 squares.\n- Alice wants to leave as many squares uncovered as possible. Bob tries to minimize leftover squares.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the minimal and maximal coverage**\n\n- The total number of tiles that can be placed is \\( \\lfloor 2022/2 \\rfloor = 1011 \\).\n\n- Since the game ends when no more moves are possible, the total number of covered squares will be \\( 2 \\times \\) number of tiles placed.\n\n- The maximum number of tiles is 1011.\n\n**Step 3: Strategy considerations**\n\n- Since Alice plays first, she can try to \"split\" the board into segments to maximize the leftover squares.\n\n- The problem reduces to a game of partitioning a 1D line with the goal to leave as many uncovered squares as possible for Alice.\n\n- The key is: **Bob's goal is to force as many uncovered squares as possible**, but Alice can attempt to mitigate this.\n\n- The worst-case for Alice is when Bob prevents covering most of the line by placing tiles to create isolated segments where coverage is impossible.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the minimal leftovers**\n\n- Since both players are optimal, and Alice plays first, one might reason:\n\n  - Alice could try to cover the board in a way that leaves long unbreakable segments.\n\n  - But because each move covers two adjacent squares, and the game aims to maximize leftovers, the final configuration depends heavily on the parity and structure.\n\n- The maximum number of uncovered squares Alice can guarantee is the minimal number left after optimal play.\n\n**Step 5: Known result**\n\n- From classic combinatorial game theory, in the case of a 1D line of length \\(N\\), with players removing dominoes (2-length tiles), playing optimally, the minimal leftover squares that Alice can enforce is:\n\n  \\[\n  N \\mod 2\n  \\]\n\n- Since \\(2022\\) is even, Alice can ensure **0** leftover squares, because:\n\n  - She can use a pairing strategy, always playing to cover as much as possible, leaving no uncovered squares at the end.\n\n  - Bob cannot prevent this due to the parity.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\n- The greatest number of uncovered squares Alice can guarantee is **0**.\n\n---\n\nNow, compiling everything in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"In Problem 1, testing small values revealed the only solution is for n=1, k=1.
