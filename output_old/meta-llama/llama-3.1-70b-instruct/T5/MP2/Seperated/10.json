  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze each problem step by step:\n\n**Problem 1: Find all functions f: R → R satisfying**\nf(xf(y) + y^3) = y f(x) + f(y)^3\n\n**Step 1: Substitution y = 0**\nf(xf(0) + 0) = 0 * f(x) + f(0)^3\nf(xf(0)) = f(0)^3\n\n*This suggests* that for all x, f(xf(0)) is constant, equal to f(0)^3.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the case f(0) = 0**\nIf f(0)=0, then f(0) = 0^3 = 0, so consistent.\n\nNow, if f(0) = 0, from Step 1:\nf(0) = 0\n\n**Step 3: Try to find f(0) when f(0) ≠ 0**\nSuppose f(0) ≠ 0, then for all x:\nf(xf(0)) = f(0)^3 ≠ 0\n\nThis implies that the function is constant on the set {xf(0): x∈ R}, which is either the entire real line if f(0) ≠ 0, or a singleton if f(0)=0. \n\nBut more strictly, from the initial substitution, the constant value is f(0)^3.\n\n**Step 4: Assume f is linear**\nSuppose f is linear: f(x) = a x, for some a ∈ R.\n\nSubstitute into original:\nf(xf(y) + y^3) = y f(x) + f(y)^3\n\nGiven f(x) = a x, then:\n\nLeft side:\nf(xa y + y^3) = a (xa y + y^3) = a^2 x y + a y^3\n\nRight side:\ny (a x) + (a y)^3 = a x y + a^3 y^3\n\nSet them equal:\na^2 x y + a y^3 = a x y + a^3 y^3\n\nCompare coefficients:\na^2 x y = a x y ⇒ (a^2 - a) x y = 0 for all x, y ⇒ implies a^2 - a = 0 ⇒ a(a - 1) = 0\n\nSimilarly:\na y^3 = a^3 y^3 ⇒ (a - a^3) y^3 = 0 for all y ⇒ a - a^3=0 ⇒ a(1 - a^2)=0 ⇒ a=0 or a=±1\n\nFrom both, valid options are a=0, a=1, or a=-1.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the solutions**\n\n- For a=0: f(x)=0\nCheck in original:\nf(0 + y^3) = y*0 + 0 => 0 = 0, holds.\nSo, f ≡ 0 is a solution.\n\n- For a=1: f(x)=x\nCheck in original:\nf(xf(y) + y^3) = f(x y + y^3) = x y + y^3\nRight: y f(x) + f(y)^3 = y x + y^3\nEqual: yes, holds.\n\n- For a=-1: f(x)=-x\nCheck:\nf(xf(y) + y^3) = f(-x y + y^3) = -(-x y + y^3) = x y - y^3\nRight: y f(x) + f(y)^3 = y*(-x) + (- y)^3 = -x y - y^3\nCompare: x y - y^3 vs. -x y - y^3, not equal unless x y = 0 for all x,y, impossible.\n\nSo, the only linear solutions are f ≡ 0 and f(x)= x.\n\n**Step 6: Final verification**\n\n- For f ≡ 0:\nOriginal: 0 = y*0 + 0, so yes.\n- For f(x) = x:\nOriginal:\nf(xf(y) + y^3) = f(x y + y^3) = x y + y^3\nRight: y x + y^3, matching, so valid.\n\n**Step 7: Consider constant solutions other than zero**\nSuppose f is constant c ≠ 0\n\nLHS: f(constant) = c\nRHS: y * c + c^3\n\nFrom the original:\nc = y c + c^3 for all y\n=> c - y c = c^3\n=> c(1 - y) = c^3\nFor this to hold for all y, c must be 0, which contradicts c ≠ 0.\n\nSo, only f ≡ 0 among constant functions.\n\n**Conclusion for problem 1:**\nf(x) ≡ 0 or f(x) = x.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2: Existence of A and B such that**\n\n- A finite set A of ≥2 positive integers\n- B an infinite set of positive integers\n\nsuch that:\n\n1) Any two distinct elements in A+B are coprime\n2) For any coprime positive integers m,n, there exists x in A+B with x ≡ n mod m\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- The first condition: pairs in A+B are pairwise coprime.\n- The second condition: for any coprime m,n, the residue class n mod m is realized by some element in A+B.\n- The set A+B = {a+b | a∈A, b∈B}, with A finite and B infinite.\n\nThis is a classic number theory problem involving the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and the multiplicativity of coprimality:\n\n- If all pairwise elements of A+B are pairwise coprime, then the differences among elements of A+B are coprime.\n- To get all residues modulo any coprime pair (m,n), we need the set A+B to be dense enough modulo various m.\n\nGiven A is finite with at least two elements:\n\n- Suppose A = {a1, a2, ..., ak}, with k ≥ 2.\n\nConstruct B:\n\n- Take B as all positive integers coprime to the product of elements in A (or sufficiently large to satisfy certain properties).\n\nCan such B exist?\n\n- For the 2nd condition: For any coprime m,n, there exists an x∈A+B with x≡ n mod m.\n\nThis effectively requires A+B to contain a complete system modulo m for coprime m.\n\n- For the first condition: Distinct elements in A+B are coprime: ensuring, for example, no two elements share common factors.\n\nA promising idea:\n\n- If A contains multiple elements that are pairwise coprime, and B contains integers with specific residues modulo various primes, then:\n\nPossible construction:\n\n- Let A = {a, c}, with gcd(a,c)=1, for simplicity choose a=1, c= some integer coprime to 1 (trivial).\n\n- Let B be the set of all positive integers coprime to a certain large product, ensuring that for any m coprime to this product, residues mod m are represented in A+B.\n\n- Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem with B designed to cover all residue classes modulo various primes.\n\nIndeed, such sets exist because:\n\n- If A contains at least two coprime positive integers, then the set A+B can be constructed, by choosing B appropriately, to satisfy the conditions.\n\nIn rough terms, the answer is **yes**, such sets exist.\n\n---\n\n**Final answers in the JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, by substitution and linearity assumptions, the solutions are f(x) ≡ 0 and f(x) = x.
