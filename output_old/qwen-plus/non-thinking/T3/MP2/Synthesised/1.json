  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are asked to solve a multi-part problem involving combinatorics and number theory. Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Understanding the Penta Game Setup\\n\\n- There are 5 players.\\n- There are 5 roles.\\n- Each player chooses **2** roles they wish to play.\\n- Each player chooses their two roles **randomly** from the 5 available.\\n- We are to compute $ T(favorable) $, the total number of favorable outcomes where **each role is selected by exactly two players**.\\n\\nNote: This is a counting problem — we are not computing the probability yet, just the number of favorable assignments.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Total Number of Role Assignments\\n\\nEach player selects a subset of 2 roles out of 5. The number of ways a single player can choose 2 roles is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\binom{5}{2} = 10\\n$$\\n\\nSo total number of possible combinations (without restriction) is $ 10^5 $, but we don't need that since we're only counting favorable outcomes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Counting Favorable Outcomes — $ T(favorable) $\\n\\nWe want the number of ways five players each pick two roles such that **each role is chosen by exactly two players**.\\n\\nLet’s reframe this:\\n\\n- We have 5 players, each choosing 2 roles → total of $ 5 \\\\times 2 = 10 $ role choices.\\n- There are 5 roles, and we want each role to be selected **exactly twice** → total $ 5 \\\\times 2 = 10 $, so the numbers match.\\n\\nSo we’re distributing 10 role selections across 5 roles, with each role getting exactly 2 picks.\\n\\nBut the selections come from players, each contributing two role picks.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of 5-tuples of 2-element subsets of roles (one per player) such that every role appears in exactly two of the subsets.\\n\\nThis is a classic combinatorics problem — counting 2-regular hypergraphs or regular set systems.\\n\\nAlternatively, think of it as a **combinatorial design**: we are assigning to each player a pair of roles, such that each role is used exactly twice.\\n\\nLet’s model this as a multiset assignment.\\n\\nLet the roles be $ R = \\\\{1,2,3,4,5\\\\} $.\\n\\nWe are to count the number of sequences $ (S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5) $, where each $ S_i \\\\subseteq R $, $ |S_i| = 2 $, and each role appears in exactly two of the $ S_i $'s.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of **2-regular 2-uniform hypergraphs** on 5 vertices with 5 hyperedges (but wait — each edge has size 2, so it's just a graph).\\n\\nWait! Each $ S_i $ is a 2-element subset — so this is like assigning 5 edges (since each player picks a pair), and we want each vertex (role) to have degree 2.\\n\\nAh! So we are forming a **2-regular graph on 5 vertices with 5 edges**, where each edge corresponds to a player's choice.\\n\\nBut a 2-regular graph is a disjoint union of cycles. On 5 vertices, the only 2-regular graph is a **5-cycle**.\\n\\nBut wait: in a 2-regular graph, each vertex has degree 2, and number of edges is $ \\\\frac{5 \\\\cdot 2}{2} = 5 $. Yes, matches.\\n\\nSo the underlying graph structure must be a 5-cycle.\\n\\nBut here's the catch: **multiple players could choose the same pair**, but in a simple graph, edges are unique. However, in our case, **players can choose the same pair** — so the same role pair can be chosen by multiple players. So we allow **multigraphs**?\\n\\nWait — no. Each $ S_i $ is a subset chosen by a player. But if two players choose the same pair, say both choose roles {1,2}, then that edge appears twice.\\n\\nSo we are allowing **multisets** of edges.\\n\\nBut we require that each **vertex** (role) has total degree 2 — meaning the number of times it appears in all chosen pairs is exactly 2.\\n\\nSo we are selecting a **multiset** of 5 unordered pairs (with replacement allowed), such that each of the 5 elements appears in exactly two of the pairs.\\n\\nBut since each appearance of a role in a pair contributes 1 to its count, and we need each role to appear in exactly two pairs, the total degree is 2 per vertex.\\n\\nSo we are looking for the number of 5-tuples of 2-element subsets of a 5-element set such that each element appears in exactly two subsets.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to decomposing the complete multigraph where each vertex has degree 2 into 5 edges (not necessarily distinct).\\n\\nBut let's approach it via double counting.\\n\\nLet’s define:\\n\\nWe are to count the number of functions from 5 players to $ \\\\binom{[5]}{2} $ such that each role appears in exactly two of the chosen pairs.\\n\\nLet’s denote the set of all such assignments as $ T(favorable) $.\\n\\nThis is a known type of problem — counting the number of 5-tuples of 2-subsets of a 5-set such that each element appears twice.\\n\\nWe can model this as follows:\\n\\nLet’s consider the incidence matrix: 5 players, each picks 2 roles → 10 role-player incidences.\\nEach role must appear in exactly 2 players’ choices → each role is picked twice.\\n\\nSo we can think of this as a bipartite graph between players and roles, with each player having degree 2, each role having degree 2.\\n\\nSo we are counting the number of **bipartite graphs** with parts $ P $ (5 players) and $ R $ (5 roles), each vertex of degree 2.\\n\\nThis is a **2-regular bipartite graph** — i.e., a disjoint union of even cycles covering all vertices.\\n\\nThe total number of such bipartite graphs (up to labeling) is what we want, but since all labels are distinct, we count labeled bipartite 2-regular graphs with both sides size 5, degrees all 2.\\n\\nSo we are to count the number of 5×5 biadjacency matrices with 0s and 1s, row sums = 2, column sums = 2.\\n\\nThis is a standard problem in combinatorics: the number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums all equal to 2.\\n\\nThis number is known and can be computed.\\n\\nLet’s compute $ N = $ number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with all row and column sums equal to 2.\\n\\nThis is given by the formula for the number of semi-regular bipartite graphs.\\n\\nIt can be computed using inclusion-exclusion or known values.\\n\\nFrom OEIS or combinatorics tables, the number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums 2 is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{(2!)^5} \\\\sum_{\\\\text{permutations}} \\\\ldots\\n$$\\n\\nAlternatively, use known value.\\n\\nActually, this is the number of **2-regular bipartite graphs** on (5,5), which equals the number of ways to decompose into cycles.\\n\\nBut let's compute it step by step.\\n\\nWe can use the formula for the number of such matrices:\\n\\nIt is equal to the coefficient of $ x_1^2 x_2^2 \\\\cdots x_5^2 y_1^2 y_2^2 \\\\cdots y_5^2 $ in $ \\\\prod_{i,j=1}^5 (1 + x_i y_j) $, but that's hard.\\n\\nAlternatively, use recurrence or known values.\\n\\nFrom known results, the number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with row and column sum 2 is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{5!} \\\\times \\\\text{number of 2-factors in } K_{5,5}\\n$$\\n\\nWait — better to use direct computation.\\n\\nStandard result: the number of such matrices is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{k=0}^{5} (-1)^k \\\\binom{5}{k} \\\\binom{\\\\binom{5-k}{2}}{5}\\n$$\\n\\nNo — better to use the formula for the number of contingency tables.\\n\\nAlternatively, recall that the number of $ n \\\\times n $ (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums all equal to 2 is given by OEIS A001499.\\n\\nLooking it up mentally:\\n\\n- n=1: 0\\n- n=2: 1\\n- n=3: 6\\n- n=4: 90\\n- n=5: 2040\\n\\nYes! OEIS A001499: Number of n×n (0,1)-matrices with exactly 2 1's in each row and column.\\n\\nFor n=5, it is 2040.\\n\\nSo $ T(favorable) = 2040 $.\\n\\nBut wait — is this correct?\\n\\nEach such matrix corresponds to a way to assign to each player two roles (via the two 1's in the row), and each role is assigned to exactly two players (column sum 2). Perfect.\\n\\nSo yes, $ T(favorable) = 2040 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Compute $ T(favorable) - 1940 $\\n\\n$$\\n2040 - 1940 = 100\\n$$\\n\\nSo we need:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\|1\\\\| + \\\\|2\\\\| + \\\\cdots + \\\\|n\\\\|}{n} = 100\\n$$\\n\\nWe are to find the smallest positive integer $ n $ such that the average of $ \\\\|k\\\\| $ from $ k=1 $ to $ n $ is 100.\\n\\nRecall: $ \\\\|k\\\\| $ is the absolute difference between $ k $ and the nearest perfect square.\\n\\nFor example:\\n- $ \\\\|1\\\\| = 0 $ (nearest square: 1)\\n- $ \\\\|2\\\\| = 1 $ (nearest: 1 or 4? |2-1|=1, |2-4|=2 → min is 1)\\n- $ \\\\|3\\\\| = 1 $ (|3-4|=1)\\n- $ \\\\|4\\\\| = 0 $\\n- $ \\\\|5\\\\| = 1 $ (|5-4|=1)\\n- $ \\\\|6\\\\| = 2 $ (|6-4|=2)\\n- $ \\\\|7\\\\| = 2 $ (|7-9|=2)\\n- $ \\\\|8\\\\| = 1 $ (|8-9|=1)\\n- $ \\\\|9\\\\| = 0 $\\n\\nSo between squares $ m^2 $ and $ (m+1)^2 $, the behavior is symmetric.\\n\\nLet’s analyze the pattern.\\n\\nBetween $ m^2 $ and $ (m+1)^2 $, there are $ 2m+1 $ integers.\\n\\nThe nearest square to $ k $ depends on whether $ k $ is closer to $ m^2 $ or $ (m+1)^2 $.\\n\\nThe midpoint between $ m^2 $ and $ (m+1)^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1 $ is at $ m^2 + m + 0.5 $.\\n\\nSo:\\n- For $ k $ from $ m^2 $ to $ m^2 + m $, nearest square is $ m^2 $\\n- For $ k $ from $ m^2 + m + 1 $ to $ m^2 + 2m + 1 $, nearest square is $ (m+1)^2 $\\n- At $ k = m^2 + m + 0.5 $, equidistant, but since integer, $ m^2 + m $ is closer to $ m^2 $? Let's check:\\n\\nDistance from $ m^2 + m $ to $ m^2 $: $ m $\\nTo $ (m+1)^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1 $: $ m + 1 $\\nSo yes, closer to $ m^2 $\\n\\nSimilarly, $ m^2 + m + 1 $: distance to $ m^2 $: $ m+1 $, to $ (m+1)^2 $: $ m $, so closer to $ (m+1)^2 $\\n\\nThus:\\n- For $ k = m^2 + j $, $ j = 0 $ to $ m $: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = j $\\n- For $ k = m^2 + m + j $, $ j = 1 $ to $ m+1 $: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = (m+1)^2 - k = (m^2 + 2m + 1) - (m^2 + m + j) = m + 1 - j $\\n\\nSo the values of $ \\\\|k\\\\| $ in the interval $ [m^2, (m+1)^2] $ are:\\n\\n- $ j = 0 $ to $ m $: $ \\\\|m^2 + j\\\\| = j $\\n- $ j = 1 $ to $ m+1 $: $ \\\\|m^2 + m + j\\\\| = m+1 - j $\\n\\nSo the sequence of $ \\\\|k\\\\| $ from $ m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 $ is:\\n\\n$ 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots, m, m, m-1, \\\\ldots, 1, 0 $? Wait:\\n\\nWait, at $ k = m^2 + m + 1 $: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = m+1 - 1 = m $\\nAt $ k = m^2 + m + 2 $: $ m-1 $\\n...\\nAt $ k = m^2 + 2m + 1 = (m+1)^2 $: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = 0 $\\n\\nAnd $ k = m^2 + m $: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = m $\\n\\nSo the full list from $ k = m^2 $ to $ k = (m+1)^2 $:\\n\\n- $ k = m^2 $: 0\\n- $ m^2 + 1 $: 1\\n- ...\\n- $ m^2 + m $: m\\n- $ m^2 + m + 1 $: m\\n- $ m^2 + m + 2 $: m-1\\n- ...\\n- $ (m+1)^2 $: 0\\n\\nSo the values are:\\n\\n$ 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots, m-1, m, m, m-1, \\\\ldots, 1, 0 $\\n\\nWait, how many terms?\\nFrom $ m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 $: $ 2m+2 $ terms? No:\\n$ (m+1)^2 - m^2 + 1 = 2m+1 +1? No, number of integers is $ (m+1)^2 - m^2 + 1 = 2m+2 $? No:\\n\\n$ (m+1)^2 - m^2 = 2m+1 $, so number of integers from $ m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 $ inclusive is $ 2m+2 $? No:\\n\\nExample: m=1: 1 to 4: 1,2,3,4 → 4 numbers, $ 2(1)+2 = 4 $? But $ 4-1+1=4 $, yes.\\nBut $ (m+1)^2 - m^2 + 1 = 2m+1 +1 = 2m+2 $? But $ 2m+1 $ gap, so $ 2m+2 $ points? No:\\n\\nFrom a to b inclusive: $ b - a + 1 $\\nSo $ (m+1)^2 - m^2 + 1 = (m^2 + 2m + 1) - m^2 + 1 = 2m + 2 $? That can’t be.\\n\\nWait: $ (m+1)^2 - m^2 = 2m+1 $, so number of integers from $ m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 $ inclusive is $ 2m+1 + 1 $? No:\\n\\nExample: m=1: m^2=1, (m+1)^2=4, integers: 1,2,3,4 → 4 numbers.\\n$ 4 - 1 + 1 = 4 $, and $ 2(1)+2 = 4 $? But 2m+2 = 4.\\nBut 2m+1 = 3, which is the difference, so count is 2m+2? That would be inconsistent.\\n\\nWait: $ b - a + 1 = (m^2 + 2m + 1) - m^2 + 1 = 2m + 2 $? No:\\n\\n$ b - a + 1 = [(m+1)^2] - [m^2] + 1 = (m^2 + 2m + 1 - m^2) + 1 = 2m + 1 + 1 = 2m + 2 $? But for m=1: 2+2=4, correct.\\nBut earlier I thought it was 2m+1, but that’s the length of the interval excluding one end.\\n\\nActually, from $ m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 $ inclusive: $ (m+1)^2 - m^2 + 1 = 2m+2 $? But $ (m+1)^2 - m^2 = 2m+1 $, so adding 1 gives $ 2m+2 $? No:\\n\\nStandard: number of integers from a to b inclusive is $ b - a + 1 $\\nSo $ (m+1)^2 - m^2 + 1 = (2m+1) + 1 = 2m+2 $? But for m=2: m^2=4, (m+1)^2=9, numbers: 4,5,6,7,8,9 → 6 numbers. 2(2)+2=6, yes.\\nBut 2m+1=5, not matching.\\n\\nWait: $ b - a + 1 = 9 - 4 + 1 = 6 $, and $ 2m+2 = 6 $ for m=2.\\nBut $ (m+1)^2 - m^2 = 5 $, so $ b - a + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 $? Only if you add 1, but $ b - a + 1 = (b - a) + 1 $, yes.\\nBut $ b - a = (m+1)^2 - m^2 = 2m+1 $, so $ b - a + 1 = 2m+2 $\\nBut that would mean there are $ 2m+2 $ integers from $ m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 $, but $ (m+1)^2 - m^2 = 2m+1 $, so the count should be $ 2m+2 $? For m=1: 1,2,3,4 → 4, which is 2(1)+2=4, yes.\\nBut that includes both endpoints.\\n\\nHowever, when we go from $ m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 $, we are including $ (m+1)^2 $, which will be the start of the next block.\\n\\nTo avoid double-counting, we should consider intervals $ [m^2, (m+1)^2) $, but since we are summing over k, we can handle overlapping.\\n\\nBut actually, for summing $ \\\\|k\\\\| $, we can sum over blocks between consecutive squares.\\n\\nDefine block $ B_m $: integers from $ m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 - 1 $, i.e., $ k = m^2, m^2+1, \\\\ldots, m^2 + 2m $\\nNumber of terms: $ 2m+1 $\\n\\nThen $ (m+1)^2 $ will be in the next block.\\n\\nBut $ \\\\|(m+1)^2\\\\| = 0 $, so we can include it in either.\\n\\nBetter to define block $ m $ as $ k $ from $ m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 $, but exclude $ (m+1)^2 $ to avoid overlap, or include only once.\\n\\nSince each $ k $ belongs to one interval, define for $ m \\\\geq 1 $, the interval $ I_m = [m^2, (m+1)^2] $, but these overlap at endpoints.\\n\\nInstead, define the interval between squares: for $ m \\\\geq 1 $, the open interval $ (m^2, (m+1)^2) $, but we need all k.\\n\\nBest: consider $ k $ from 1 to $ n $, and group by the square below.\\n\\nBut for asymptotic, we can sum over complete intervals.\\n\\nLet’s compute the sum $ S(m) = \\\\sum_{k=m^2}^{(m+1)^2} \\\\|k\\\\| $\\n\\nAs established, for $ k $ from $ m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 $, inclusive, there are $ 2m+2 $ integers? Earlier calculation shows $ (m+1)^2 - m^2 + 1 = 2m+2 $\\nBut for m=1: 1 to 4: 4 numbers, 2(1)+2=4, ok.\\nBut $ (m+1)^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1 $, so $ k $ from $ m^2 $ to $ m^2 + 2m + 1 $, inclusive: number is $ (m^2 + 2m + 1) - m^2 + 1 = 2m + 2 $\\n\\nValues of $ \\\\|k\\\\| $:\\n- $ k = m^2 + j $, $ j=0 $ to $ m $: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = j $\\n- $ k = m^2 + m + j $, $ j=1 $ to $ m+1 $: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = (m+1)^2 - k = (m^2 + 2m + 1) - (m^2 + m + j) = m + 1 - j $\\n\\nSo for $ j=1 $: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = m $\\n$ j=2 $: $ m-1 $\\n...\\n$ j=m+1 $: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = 0 $\\n\\nNow, list all values:\\n- j=0: 0\\n- j=1: 1\\n- j=2: 2\\n- ...\\n- j=m: m\\n- then j=1 to m+1 in the second part: values m, m-1, ..., 0\\n\\nSo the sequence is:\\n0,1,2,...,m, m, m-1, ..., 1, 0\\n\\nHow many terms?\\nFirst part: j=0 to m: m+1 terms\\nSecond part: j=1 to m+1: m+1 terms\\nTotal: 2m+2 terms, matches.\\n\\nSum = sum of first part + sum of second part\\n\\nFirst part: $ \\\\sum_{j=0}^m j = \\\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} $\\n\\nSecond part: $ \\\\sum_{j=1}^{m+1} (m+1 - j) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{m} i = \\\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} $, where $ i = m+1 - j $\\n\\nSo total sum over $ k = m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 $ is:\\n\\n$$\\nS_m = \\\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} + \\\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} = m(m+1)\\n$$\\n\\nBut this includes both $ m^2 $ and $ (m+1)^2 $, each with $ \\\\|k\\\\| = 0 $\\n\\nNow, if we sum from $ k=1 $ to $ k=n $, we need to handle partial blocks.\\n\\nNote that $ k=1 = 1^2 $, so we can start from m=1.\\n\\nBut $ k=1 $: $ \\\\|1\\\\| = 0 $\\n\\nLet’s verify for m=1:\\nInterval: k=1 to 4\\nValues:\\nk=1:0, k=2:1, k=3:1, k=4:0\\nSum = 0+1+1+0=2\\nFormula: m(m+1)=1*2=2, correct.\\n\\nm=2: k=4 to 9\\nk=4:0,5:1,6:2,7:2,8:1,9:0 → sum=0+1+2+2+1+0=6\\nFormula: 2*3=6, correct.\\n\\nm=3: k=9 to 16\\nk=9:0,10:1,11:2,12:3,13:3,14:2,15:1,16:0 → sum=0+1+2+3+3+2+1+0=12\\nFormula:3*4=12, correct.\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nBut now, if we sum from k=a to k=b, and a and b are perfect squares, say a=m^2, b=n^2, then the sum is sum over m to n-1 of S_k = sum_{k=m}^{n-1} k(k+1)\\n\\nBut we need sum from k=1 to n.\\n\\nk=1 is 1^2, so let’s assume n is large.\\n\\nLet $ s(n) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\|k\\\\| $\\n\\nFind the largest m such that $ m^2 \\\\leq n $\\n\\nThen sum from k=1 to n = sum over complete blocks from m=1 to m-1, plus partial block from m^2 to n.\\n\\nBlock m goes from $ m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 $, sum $ m(m+1) $\\n\\nBut block m starts at $ m^2 $, ends at $ (m+1)^2 $\\n\\nFor k from 1 to n, suppose $ m^2 \\\\leq n < (m+1)^2 $\\n\\nThen the complete blocks are from block 1 to block m-1? \\n\\nBlock 1: k=1 to 4\\nBlock 2: k=4 to 9\\nBut k=4 is in both.\\n\\nProblem: the blocks overlap at endpoints.\\n\\nIn our definition, block m includes $ m^2 $ and $ (m+1)^2 $\\n\\nSo if we sum block 1 to block m-1, we include up to $ m^2 $, but $ m^2 $ is included in block m-1 and also in block m.\\n\\nTo avoid double-counting, we should define the blocks to be disjoint.\\n\\nBetter: define the interval for “between” squares.\\n\\nDefine for each m ≥ 1, the interval $ I_m = [m^2, (m+1)^2) = \\\\{m^2, m^2+1, \\\\ldots, m^2 + 2m\\\\} $, which has $ 2m+1 $ integers.\\n\\nThen $ (m+1)^2 $ is not included; it will be in $ I_{m+1} $.\\n\\nBut $ \\\\|(m+1)^2\\\\| = 0 $, and it should be counted.\\n\\nSo define $ I_m $ for m≥1: k from $ m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 - 1 $, i.e., $ m^2 $ to $ m^2 + 2m $\\n\\nNumber of terms: $ 2m+1 $\\n\\nWithin this interval, the nearest square:\\n- For k = m^2 + j, j=0 to m: nearest is m^2, so $ \\\\|k\\\\| = j $\\n- For k = m^2 + j, j=m+1 to 2m: nearest is (m+1)^2? Distance to m^2: j, to (m+1)^2: (m^2 + 2m + 1) - (m^2 + j) = 2m+1 - j \\nSet j > m, so compare j and 2m+1-j\\nWhen j < 2m+1-j, i.e., 2j < 2m+1, j < m+0.5, so j≤m\\nFor j≥m+1, 2j ≥ 2m+2 > 2m+1, so j > 2m+1-j, so closer to (m+1)^2\\nThus $ \\\\|k\\\\| = 2m+1 - j $\\n\\nSo for j=0 to m: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = j $\\nFor j=m+1 to 2m: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = 2m+1 - j $\\n\\nNote j=2m: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = 2m+1 - 2m = 1 $\\nBut k = m^2 + 2m = (m+1)^2 - 1, distance to (m+1)^2 is 1, to m^2 is 2m, so yes, $ \\\\|k\\\\| = 1 $\\n\\nNow, sum over $ I_m $:\\n\\nSum = $ \\\\sum_{j=0}^m j + \\\\sum_{j=m+1}^{2m} (2m+1 - j) $\\n\\nFirst sum: $ \\\\sum_{j=0}^m j = \\\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} $\\n\\nSecond sum: let i = j - (m+1), then j=m+1 to 2m → i=0 to m-1\\n$ 2m+1 - j = 2m+1 - (m+1 + i) = m - i $\\nSo sum = $ \\\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (m - i) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{m} k = \\\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} $?

Not integer.\\nSo no solution in d≤299.\\nNow if d>299, then partial = sum_{j=0}^{299} j + sum_{j=300}^d (2*299 +1 - j) = sum_{j=0}^{299} j + sum_{j=300}^d (599 - j)\\nFirst sum: 299*300/2=44,850\\nSecond sum: for j=300 to d, values 599-300=299, 599-301=298, ..., 599-d\\nSo arithmetic series: first term 299, last term 599-d, number of terms d-299\\nSum = (d-299)(299 + 599 - d)/2 = (d-299)(898 - d)/2\\nSo total partial = 44,850 + (d-299)(898 - d)/2\\ns(n) = 8,910,200 + 44,850 + (d-299)(898 - d)/2 = 8,955,050 + (d-299)(898 - d)/2\\nn = 89,401 + d\\nSet s(n) = 100n = 100(89,401 + d) = 8,940,100 + 100d\\nSo:\\n8,955,050 + (d-299)(898 - d)/2 = 8,940,100 + 100d\\nBring to left:\\n8,955,050 - 8,940,100 + (d-299)(898 - d)/2 - 100d = 0\\n14,950 + \\\\frac{(d-299)(898 - d)}{2} - 100d = 0\\nMultiply by 2:\\n29,900 + (d-299)(898 - d) - 200d = 0\\nExpand: (d-299)(898 - d) = d*898 - d^2 -299*898 + 299d = 898d - d^2 - 268,502 + 299d = -d^2 + 1,197d - 268,502\\nThen total: 29,900 - d^2 + 1,197d - 268,502 - 200d = -d^2 + 997d - 238,602\\nSet to 0:\\n- d^2 + 997d - 238,602 = 0\\nMultiply by -1:\\nd^2 - 997d + 238,602 = 0\\nDiscriminant = 997^2 - 4*238,602 = 994,009 - 954,408 = 39,601\\nsqrt(39,601) = 199, since 200^2=40,000, 199^2=39,601\\nYes.\\nSo d = [997 ± 199]/2\\nd = (997+199)/2 = 1196/2=598\\nor d=(997-199)/2=798/2=399\\nNow d > 299, and d ≤ 2*299=598, since n < 300^2=90,000, so d ≤ 598\\nd=598 or d=399\\nBoth valid.\\nd=399: n=89,401 + 399=89,800\\nd=598: n=89,401 + 598=89,999\\nNow, for d=399, n=89,800\\ns(n) = 100n? By construction, yes.\\nBut is it smaller than 89,999? Yes.\\nNow check if it satisfies.\\nBut we have two solutions: n=89,800 and n=89,999\\nSmallest is 89,800\\nBut is this correct?\\nWe need to ensure that for d=399, it is in the case d>299, which it is.\\nNow, compute s(n) for n=89,800\\nFrom above, s(n) = 8,955,050 + (d-299)(898 - d)/2 with d=399\\nFirst, d-299=100\\n898 - d=898-399=499\\nSo (100)*499 / 2 = 100*249.5? No, /2 is outside?\\nFrom earlier: (d-299)(898 - d)/2 = 100 * 499 / 2 = 49,900 / 2 = 24,950\\nThen s(n) = 8,955,050 + 24,950 = 8,980,000? But earlier expression was s(n) = 8,955,050 + (d-299)(898-d)/2\\nBut 8,955,050 + 24,950 = 8,980,000\\nn=89,800\\n100n=8,980,000, yes equal.\\nNow for n=89,999, also equal.\\nBut is there a smaller one?\\nd=399 gives n=89,800, d=598 gives n=89,999\\nBut are there more?\\nThis is within m=299 block.\\nBut perhaps in earlier blocks.\\nSince we have s(n)=100n, and s(n) is roughly c n^{3/2}, but anyway.\\nNow, is there a solution with smaller n?\\nFor example, in m=298 block.\\nBut likely 89,800 is smaller than previous, but let's see if there are others.\\nSince the function s(n) - 100n may have multiple zeros, but we want the smallest positive n where it is zero.\\nAt n=1, s(1)=0, 100*1=100, not equal.\\nBut perhaps there are smaller solutions.\\nNote that at the end of each block, s(n)/n = (m+1)/3, which is less than 100 for m<299.\\nWithin blocks, it may reach 100.\\nBut for m<299, the maximum s(n)/n in the block is at the end, (m+1)/3 < 100, so cannot reach 100.\\nFor m=299, we have two solutions: n=89,800 and n=89,999\\nSmaller is 89,800\\nBut is n=89,800 >= 299^2=89,401? Yes, 89,800 > 89,401.\\nNow, confirm the sum.\\nWe have s(n) = sum up to k=89,800\\nFrom construction, it should be 8,980,000\\nBut let's verify with the formula.\\nSince we derived it from the equation and it satisfied, and the math checks, it should be correct.\\nMoreover, for d=399, j=d=399, m=299, j>m, so in the second part.\\n\\|k\\| for k=89,401 + j, j=399\\nk=89,401+399=89,800\\nNow, j=399, m=299, since j>m, \\|k\\|=2m+1 - j=598+1-399=599-399=200? 2*299+1=599, yes, 599-399=200\\nBut earlier we didn't need individual, but in the sum it's consistent.\\nNow, so the smallest n is 89,800\\nBut is there any smaller n in this or earlier blocks?\\nFor m<299, as said, max average is (m+1)/3 <= 299/3<100, so s(n)/n <100 for all n in those blocks.\\nFor m=299, n starts at 89,401, and we have solutions at n=89,800 and 89,999, so 89,800 is the smallest.\\nBut is there a solution before m=299? No, because average never reaches 100.\\nHence the smallest n is 89,800.\\n\\nBut recall that T(favorable) = 2040, T(favorable) - 1940 = 100, and we found n such that average is 100, and smallest such n is 89,800.\\n\\nBut in the problem, it says \\\"compute the smallest positive integer n such that [average] = (T(favorable) - 1940)\\\"\\nWhich is 100.\\n\\nSo answer is 89800.\\n\\nBut let me write it without comma.\\n\\nFinal answer: 89800\",\n    \"answer\": \"89800\"\n}",
