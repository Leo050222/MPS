  "math_problem": "There are $N$ lockers, labeled from 1 to $N$, placed in clockwise order around a circular hallway. Initially, all lockers are open. Ansoon starts at the first locker and always moves clockwise. When she is at locker $n$ and there are more than $n$ open lockers, she keeps locker $n$ open and closes the next $n$ open lockers, then repeats the process with the next open locker. If she is at locker $n$ and there are at most $n$ lockers still open, she keeps locker $n$ open and closes all other lockers. She continues this process until only one locker is left open. What is the smallest integer $N>2021$ such that the last open locker is locker 1? Instead of determining the smallest integer greater than a fixed threshold such that the locker elimination process results in the starting locker being the last open, simply find $l = $ last $+ 0$, where last is the label of the last open locker derived from the analysis of the process in that scenario. For an even integer positive integer $n$ Kevin has a tape of length $4 n$ with marks at $-2 n,-2 n+1, \\ldots, 2 n-1,2 n$. He then randomly picks $n$ points in the set $-n,-n+1,-n+2, \\ldots, n-1, n$, and places a stone on each of these points. We call a stone 'stuck' if it is on $2 n$ or $-2 n$, or either all the points to the right, or all the points to the left, all contain stones. Then, every minute, Kevin shifts the unstuck stones in the following manner: He picks an unstuck stone uniformly at random and then flips a fair coin. If the coin came up heads, he then moves that stone and every stone in the largest contiguous set containing that stone one point to the left. If the coin came up tails, he moves every stone in that set one point right instead. He repeats until all the stones are stuck. Let $p_{k}$ be the probability that at the end of the process there are exactly $k$ stones in the right half. Evaluate $$\\frac{\\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k}{\\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} p_k}$$ in terms of $n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem presented is extremely complex and appears to combine two unrelated subproblems: one involving a locker elimination process on a circular hallway, and another involving stochastic movement of stones on a tape. However, upon close inspection, the second part of the problem references a variable $ l $ defined as $ \\\\text{last} + 0 $, where 'last' is supposedly derived from the first part. But then it says: 'Instead of determining the smallest integer greater than a fixed threshold such that... simply find $ l = \\\\text{last} + 0 $'. This suggests that we are not actually supposed to compute the locker elimination process for $ N > 2021 $, but rather that this entire setup is a red herring or misdirection.\n\nMoreover, the instruction says: 'simply find $ l = \\\\text{last} + 0 $', which trivially means $ l = \\\\text{last} $. But without computing the actual locker process (which is non-trivial), and given that the rest of the problem depends on $ l $, this seems contradictory.\n\nHowever, note the phrase: 'Instead of determining...', which implies that we are to bypass the entire first problem and take $ l $ as being equal to the label of the last open locker — but in a scenario where that label is already known or can be deduced easily.\n\nBut then the problem immediately shifts to Kevin's stone process, asking us to evaluate:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k}{\\\\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} p_k}\\n$$\\n\\nin terms of $ n $, where $ p_k $ is the probability of exactly $ k $ stones ending up in the right half.\\n\\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the first part is skipped with 'instead of...', it's likely that this entire narrative is obfuscation, and we're meant to recognize a mathematical pattern or symmetry.\\n\\nNow consider the stone movement process:\\n\\n- Stones start at positions from $-n$ to $n$, total of $ n $ stones placed on integer points in $\\\\{-n, -n+1, \\\\ldots, n\\\\}$.\\n- The tape goes from $-2n$ to $2n$, so there's extra space.\\n- A stone is 'stuck' if it's at $ \\\\pm 2n $, or if all points to its left or all to its right are occupied.\\n- Unstuck stones are moved in contiguous blocks based on coin flips until all are stuck.\\n\\nEventually, all stones become stuck. Due to the shifting rules, the process will end when stones are clumped at the ends.\\n\\nBut the key observation: the process is symmetric in space (left/right) and the coin flips are fair. Also, the initial configuration is symmetric (positions chosen from symmetric set).\\n\\nThus, the final distribution should respect symmetry. However, the quantity asked involves alternating sums and normalization.\\n\\nLet’s suppose that due to symmetry, the probabilities $ p_k $ satisfy certain properties.\\n\\nBut now notice the summation limits: from $ k = l $ to $ n-1 $. Since $ k $ counts the number of stones in the right half, and there are $ n $ stones total, $ k $ ranges from 0 to $ n $. But the sum is from $ l $ to $ n-1 $.\\n\\nBut we still don't know $ l $.\\n\\nWait — recall: 'Instead of determining the smallest integer $ N > 2021 $ such that the last open locker is locker 1, simply find $ l = \\\\text{last} + 0 $'.\\n\\nThis is highly suggestive. It says: don't do the hard work; just use $ l = \\\\text{last} $, where 'last' would have been the result of the process. But since we are told to skip it, perhaps 'last' refers to the last open locker in general, but in a known case?\\n\\nAlternatively, could 'last' simply mean $ N $? Or is there a standard problem like the Josephus problem here?\\n\\nIn many such elimination problems around a circle with deterministic rules, the survivor position can be analyzed. But Ansoon's rule is unusual:\\n\\n- At locker $ n $, if more than $ n $ open lockers remain, she closes the next $ n $ open ones.\\n- Else, she closes all others, leaving only locker $ n $ open.\\n\\nBut she starts at locker 1, moves clockwise, and processes each current locker.\\n\\nThis process is state-dependent and non-standard.\\n\\nHowever, the problem says: 'Instead of determining...', so we are explicitly instructed to ignore solving for $ N > 2021 $.\\n\\nThen it says: 'simply find $ l = \\\\text{last} + 0 $'. So $ l = \\\\text{last} $, and 'last' is the label of the last open locker in that analysis. But since we are skipping it, and no value is provided, this suggests that either:\\n\\n1. 'last' is always 1 (since we want locker 1 to survive), so $ l = 1 $.\\n\\nBut the condition is that we choose $ N > 2021 $ minimal such that locker 1 survives. So for that specific $ N $, the last open locker is 1, hence $ \\\\text{last} = 1 $, so $ l = 1 $.\\n\\nTherefore, even though we don't compute $ N $, we are told that in the scenario under consideration, the last open locker is locker 1. Hence $ l = 1 $.\\n\\nSo $ l = 1 $.\\n\\nNow the expression becomes:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k}\\n$$\\n\\nNote: $ k $ goes from 1 to $ n-1 $, excluding 0 and $ n $.\\n\\nWe are to evaluate this in terms of $ n $.\\n\\nNow consider the full probability space: $ \\\\sum_{k=0}^n p_k = 1 $.\\n\\nDue to the symmetry of the setup — the initial placement is symmetric about 0, the movement rules are symmetric (fair coin), and the tape is symmetric — the entire process is symmetric under reflection (left ↔ right, position $ x \\\\leftrightarrow -x $).\\n\\nUnder this symmetry, the event of having $ k $ stones in the right half corresponds to having $ n-k $ stones in the left half, which is equivalent to having $ k $ stones in the left half, so $ p_k = p_{n-k} $.\\n\\nThus, the distribution is symmetric: $ p_k = p_{n-k} $.\\n\\nNow consider the numerator:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k\\n$$\\n\\nLet $ m = n-1-k $, so $ k = n-1-m $. When $ k=1 $, $ m = n-2 $; when $ k=n-1 $, $ m=0 $. So reversing:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{m=0}^{n-2} (-1)^m p_{n-1-m}\\n$$\\n\\nBut $ p_{n-1-m} = p_{1+m} $ by symmetry ($ p_j = p_{n-j} $), so $ p_{n-1-m} = p_{1+m} $.\\n\\nNot obviously helpful.\\n\\nInstead, consider pairing terms.\\n\\nLet’s write the numerator as:\\n\\n$$\\nS = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k\\n$$\\n\\nSplit into even and odd powers.\\n\\nBut better: let $ j = n - k $. Then when $ k=1 $, $ j=n-1 $; $ k=n-1 $, $ j=1 $. And $ p_k = p_{n-j} = p_j $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nS = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-(n-j)} p_{n-j} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{j-1} p_j\\n$$\\n\\nWait: $ (-1)^{n-1-k} = (-1)^{n-1 - (n-j)} = (-1)^{j-1} $\\n\\nBut $ p_{n-j} = p_j $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nS = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{j-1} p_j\\n$$\\n\\nBut this is the same as:\\n\\n$$\\nS = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k\\n$$\\n\\nSo we have:\\n\\n$$\\nS = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k\\n$$\\n\\nThis implies:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k\\n$$\\n\\nThis can only hold for all symmetric $ p_k $ if the expression is self-consistent, but actually this derivation shows that the exponent transformation leads to an equivalent sum with different sign pattern unless $ n-1-k \\\\equiv k-1 \\\\pmod{2} $, which would require $ n-1-k - (k-1) = n - 2k \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2} $, i.e., $ n $ even ⇒ $ 2k $ even ⇒ always true? No.\\n\\nActually, I think I made a mistake.\\n\\nFrom symmetry: $ p_k = p_{n-k} $, so let's substitute $ k \\\\to n-k $ in the original sum:\\n\\n$$\\nS = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-(n-k)} p_{n-k} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k\\n$$\\n\\nYes, so $ S = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k $\\n\\nBut also $ S = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k $\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k\\n$$\\n\\nThis implies that the weighted sum is equal to its 'reverse' version.\\n\\nBut unless the weights are symmetric, this doesn't help directly.\\n\\nSet $ T = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k $\\n\\nAnd from above, $ T = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nT = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k\\n$$\\n\\nBut also:\\n\\n$$\\nT = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k\\n$$\\n\\nAdd them:\\n\\n$$\\n2T = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\\\left[ (-1)^{k-1} + (-1)^{n-1-k} \\\\right] p_k\\n$$\\n\\nNow, $ (-1)^{k-1} + (-1)^{n-1-k} = (-1)^{k-1} \\\\left( 1 + (-1)^{n-2k} \\\\right) $\\n\\nNote that $ (-1)^{n-2k} = (-1)^n $, since $ 2k $ even.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n(-1)^{k-1} + (-1)^{n-1-k} = (-1)^{k-1} (1 + (-1)^n)\\n$$\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n- If $ n $ is odd, $ (-1)^n = -1 $, so $ 1 + (-1)^n = 0 $, so $ 2T = 0 \\\\Rightarrow T = 0 $\\n- If $ n $ is even, $ (-1)^n = 1 $, so $ 1 + 1 = 2 $, so $ 2T = 2 \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k $, which just gives $ T = T $, no new info.\\n\\nBut from earlier, when $ n $ is odd, $ T = 0 $.\\n\\nNow, what about the denominator: $ D = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k $\\n\\nSince $ \\\\sum_{k=0}^n p_k = 1 $, and $ p_0 = p_n $ by symmetry, so $ 2p_0 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k = 1 $, thus $ D = 1 - 2p_0 $\\n\\nWhen $ n $ is odd, $ T = 0 $, so the ratio is $ 0 / D = 0 $, provided $ D > 0 $, which it is unless all mass is at 0 and n, but unlikely.\\n\\nBut is $ T = 0 $ only when $ n $ odd?\\n\\nFrom above, yes.\\n\\nBut wait — we have $ T = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k $\\n\\nAnd we showed that $ T = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k $\\n\\nAnd their average gives $ T = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k $\\n\\nBut when $ n $ is odd, we got $ T = 0 $.\\n\\nNow consider $ n $ even.\\n\\nLet $ n $ be even.\\n\\nThen $ n-1 $ is odd.\\n\\nThe numerator is $ \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{\\\\text{odd} - k} p_k = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{1-k} p_k = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k $ since $ (-1)^{-k} = (-1)^k $, but wait:\\n\\n$ (-1)^{n-1-k} = (-1)^{(n-1)-k} $. Since $ n-1 $ odd, $ = (-1)^{1-k} = (-1)^{1} (-1)^{-k} = - [(-1)^k]^{-1} $, better: $ (-1)^{-k} = (-1)^k $, since even function.\\n\\nActually, $ (-1)^{a} = (-1)^{-a} $ because $ (-1)^{2a} = 1 $.\\n\\nSo $ (-1)^{1-k} = (-1)^{k-1} $\\n\\nYes, so $ (-1)^{n-1-k} = (-1)^{k-1} $ when $ n-1 $ is odd, i.e., $ n $ even.\\n\\nSo for $ n $ even, $ T = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k $\\n\\nBut also from symmetry, we had $ T = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k $, so consistent.\\n\\nBut can we evaluate this?\\n\\nConsider the full alternating sum:\\n\\nLet $ A = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k p_k $\\n\\nBy symmetry $ p_k = p_{n-k} $, and $ (-1)^k + (-1)^{n-k} = (-1)^k (1 + (-1)^n) $\\n\\nIf $ n $ even, $ = 2 (-1)^k $, so pairs contribute $ 2 (-1)^k p_k $\\n\\nBut $ k $ and $ n-k $ may be same if $ k = n/2 $\\n\\nLet $ n $ be even.\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$$\\nA = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k p_k = p_0 - p_1 + p_2 - \\\\cdots + p_n \\\\quad \\\\text{(since $ n $ even, $ (-1)^n = 1 $)}\\n$$\\n\\nGroup $ k $ and $ n-k $:\\n\\nFor $ k = 0 $: term $ p_0 $\\n\\n$ k = n $: term $ (-1)^n p_n = p_n = p_0 $\\n\\nSo together: $ p_0 + p_0 = 2p_0 $\\n\\nFor $ k = 1 $: $ -p_1 $\\n\\n$ k = n-1 $: $ (-1)^{n-1} p_{n-1} = -p_{n-1} = -p_1 $\\n\\nSum: $ -2p_1 $\\n\\nFor $ k = 2 $: $ +p_2 $\\n\\n$ k = n-2 $: $ (+1) p_{n-2} = p_2 $ → sum $ +2p_2 $\\n\\nAnd so on, up to $ k = n/2 $\\n\\nWhen $ k = n/2 $, $ n-k = n/2 $, so only once: term $ (-1)^{n/2} p_{n/2} $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nA = 2 \\\\sum_{j=0}^{n/2 - 1} (-1)^j p_j + (-1)^{n/2} p_{n/2}\\n$$\\n\\nNot obviously zero.\\n\\nBut we need $ T = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k $\\n\\nWrite:\\n\\n$$\\nT = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k = - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k p_k\\n$$\\n\\nNow $ \\\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k p_k = p_0 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k p_k + p_n = 2p_0 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k p_k $\\n\\nSo $ \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k p_k = A - 2p_0 $\\n\\nThus $ T = - (A - 2p_0) = 2p_0 - A $\\n\\nBut without knowing $ A $, this doesn't help.\\n\\nPerhaps due to the dynamics, the final configuration has stones at the ends, and the number in the right half might be concentrated.\\n\\nBut the problem asks for the ratio in terms of $ n $, suggesting a simple answer.\\n\\nRecall that we concluded $ l = 1 $, because the last open locker is 1, so $ l = 1 $.\\n\\nNow, go back to the ratio:\\n\\n$$\\nR = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k}\\n$$\\n\\nFrom symmetry and the earlier derivation, when $ n $ is odd, we found $ T = 0 $, so $ R = 0 $.\\n\\nWhat about when $ n $ is even?\\n\\nTry small $ n $.\\n\\nTake $ n = 2 $.\\n\\nThen $ l = 1 $, sum from $ k=1 $ to $ n-1 = 1 $, so only $ k=1 $.\\n\\nNumerator: $ (-1)^{2-1-1} p_1 = (-1)^0 p_1 = p_1 $\\n\\nDenominator: $ p_1 $\\n\\nSo $ R = p_1 / p_1 = 1 $\\n\\nNow, is this possible? For $ n=2 $, two stones.\\n\\nInitial positions: choose 2 points from $\\\\{-2,-1,0,1,2\\\\}$, but no: Kevin picks $ n=2 $ points from the set $\\\\{-2,-1,0,1,2\\\\}$? Wait no.\\n\\nThe set is $\\\\{-n, -n+1, \\\\ldots, n\\\\} = \\\\{-2,-1,0,1,2\\\\}$ for $ n=2 $, and he picks $ n=2 $ points randomly from these 5 points.\\n\\nBut the tape is from $-4$ to $4$, since $ 4n = 8 $, marks at $-4$ to $4$.\\n\\nStones are initially placed on two distinct points in $\\\\{-2,-1,0,1,2\\\\}$.\\n\\nA stone is stuck if at $ \\\\pm 4 $, or if all points to left or all to right are occupied.\\n\\nInitially, unless they are at edges, they are not stuck.\\n\\nBut eventually, they move to the ends.\\n\\nBut due to symmetry, $ p_0 = p_2 $, and $ p_1 $ is the probability that one stone is in right half.\\n\\nRight half: probably $ x > 0 $, so positions 1,2,3,4. But stones can move.\\n\\nActually, the 'right half' likely means positive positions.\\n\\nBut the final positions: stones get stuck at $ \\\\pm 4 $, or when blocked.\\n\\nBut the process might result in both stones at $-4$, or both at $4$, or one at each.\\n\\nBy symmetry, $ P(\\\\text{both at } 4) = P(\\\\text{both at } -4) $, and $ P(\\\\text{one at each}) $.\\n\\nThen number in right half: 2, 0, or 1.\\n\\nSo $ p_0 = P(\\\\text{both at } -4) $, $ p_2 = P(\\\\text{both at } 4) = p_0 $, $ p_1 = P(\\\\text{split}) $\\n\\nNow, is it possible that $ p_1 = 1 $? Or can they end up together?\\n\\nThe movement rule: move a largest contiguous block containing a randomly chosen unstuck stone.\\n\\nDepending on initial position and randomness, they might drift apart or together.\\n\\nBut in any case, for $ n=2 $, our calculation gave $ R = 1 $.\\n\\nFor $ n=1 $, but $ n $ is even, as stated: 'for an even integer positive integer $ n $'\\n\\nSo $ n $ even.\\n\\nWe did $ n=2 $: $ R=1 $\\n\\nNow $ n=4 $\\n\\nThen $ l=1 $, sum from $ k=1 $ to $ 3 $\\n\\nNumerator: $ \\\\sum_{k=1}^3 (-1)^{4-1-k} p_k = \\\\sum_{k=1}^3 (-1)^{3-k} p_k = (-1)^2 p_1 + (-1)^1 p_2 + (-1)^0 p_3 = p_1 - p_2 + p_3 $\\n\\nDenominator: $ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 $\\n\\nBy symmetry, $ p_1 = p_3 $, $ p_0 = p_4 $\\n\\nSo numerator: $ p_1 - p_2 + p_1 = 2p_1 - p_2 $\\n\\nDenominator: $ p_1 + p_2 + p_1 = 2p_1 + p_2 $\\n\\nSo $ R = \\\\frac{2p_1 - p_2}{2p_1 + p_2} $\\n\\nIs this necessarily 1? Only if $ p_2 = 0 $, which is unlikely.\\n\\nBut in our earlier logic for $ n $ even, we had that the sum $ T = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k $\\n\\nFor $ n=4 $, $ T = (-1)^{0} p_1 + (-1)^1 p_2 + (-1)^2 p_3 = p_1 - p_2 + p_3 = 2p_1 - p_2 $\\n\\nSame as above.\\n\\nBut is there a reason this equals the denominator?\\n\\nOnly if $ p_2 = 0 $, which is not true.\\n\\nBut perhaps in this specific dynamic, the final number of stones in the right half is always $ n/2 $ or something.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps the process is such that the final configuration has all stones at the ends, and due to conservation or symmetry, the expected number is $ n/2 $, but the probability distribution might be symmetric.\\n\\nBut the ratio is not necessarily 1.\\n\\nWait — for $ n=2 $, we got 1.\\n\\nWhat if for all even $ n $, the ratio is 1?\\n\\nThat would require $ \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k $\\n\\nWhich implies that the alternating sum equals the regular sum, so the negative terms must be zero.\\n\\nThat is, whenever $ (-1)^{n-1-k} = -1 $, then $ p_k = 0 $.\\n\\nFor $ n $ even, $ n-1 $ odd, so $ (-1)^{n-1-k} = -1 $ when $ n-1-k $ odd, i.e., $ k $ even.\\n\\nBecause odd minus even is odd, odd minus odd is even.\\n\\n$ n-1 $ odd, $ k $ even: odd - even = odd → $ (-1)^{odd} = -1 $\\n\\n$ k $ odd: odd - odd = even → $ (+1) $\\n\\nSo the numerator is $ \\\\sum_{k \\\\text{ odd}} p_k - \\\\sum_{k \\\\text{ even}} p_k $\\n\\nThe denominator is $ \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k $\\n\\nFor the ratio to be 1, we need $ \\\\sum_{k \\\\text{ odd}} p_k - \\\\sum_{k \\\\text{ even}} p_k = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k $\\n\\nWhich implies $ - \\\\sum_{k \\\\text{ even}} p_k = \\\\sum_{k \\\\text{ even}} p_k $, so $ \\\\sum_{k \\\\text{ even}} p_k = 0 $, so $ p_k = 0 $ for all even $ k $ in 1 to n-1.\\n\\nBut for $ n=2 $, k=1 is odd, so no even k, so vacuously true, and we had R=1.\\n\\nFor n=4, k=2 is even, so we need p_2=0.\\n\\nIs it possible that p_2=0? That would mean never exactly 2 stones in right half.\\n\\nBut with 4 stones, it's very likely to have 2 in each half.\\n\\nUnless the dynamics force imbalance.\\n\\nPerhaps 'right half' means x>0, and stones end up at extremes, so if they split, it might be 2 at each end, so 2 in right half.\\n\\nSo p_2 >0.\\n\\nContradiction.\\n\\nPerhaps for this specific process, the number of stones in the right half is always odd or something.\\n\\nAnother thought: perhaps the entire sum from k=1 to n-1 of p_k is 1, and the alternating sum is 1, but unlikely.\\n\\nGo back to the beginning.\\n\\nThe problem says: 'Evaluate ... in terms of n'.\\n\\nAnd we have l=1.\\n\\nBut perhaps 'last' is not 1.\\n\\nRe-read: 'Instead of determining the smallest integer N>2021 such that the last open locker is locker 1, simply find l = last + 0, where last is the label of the last open locker derived from the analysis of the process in that scenario.'\\n\\nSo in the scenario where N>2021 is minimal with last open locker being 1, then last=1, so l=1.\\n\\nSo l=1 is correct.\\n\\nPerhaps the ratio is 0 for all n, but for n=2 it's 1.\\n\\nUnless n is assumed large, but no.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps 'last' refers to the last value in the sum, but that doesn't make sense.\\n\\nOr 'last' means n, so l=n.\\n\\nThen sum from k=n to n-1, which is empty if n > n-1, so empty sum.\\n\\nNumerator 0, denominator 0, undefined.\\n\\nNot good.\\n\\nPerhaps 'last' means the last possible k, which is n, but again sum from k=n to n-1 is empty.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nPerhaps in the locker problem, for the N>2021 with locker 1 surviving, the 'last' open locker is 1, so l=1.\\n\\nI think that's solid.\\n\\nPerhaps the answer is 0, but for n=2 it's 1.\\n\\nUnless the stone process for n=2 always results in one stone on each side, so p_1=1, p_0=p_2=0, then for n=2, numerator p_1=1, denominator p_1=1, ratio 1.\\n\\nFor n=4, if similarly, the number of stones in the right half is always odd, then p_2=0, p_0=p_4=0 or something.\\n\\nBut p_0 and p_4 are not in the sum.\\n\\nIf p_k=0 for even k, then for n=4, p_2=0, p_1 and p_3 nonzero, p_1=p_3.\\n\\nThen numerator: p_1 - p_2 + p_3 = p_1 + p_3 = 2p_1\\n\\nDenominator: p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 2p_1\\n\\nSo ratio = 1.\\n\\nSimilarly, for any even n, if p_k = 0 for even k, then in the sum from k=1 to n-1, only odd k contribute.\\n\\nFor odd k, n-1-k = even - odd = odd, since n-1 odd, k odd, odd-odd=even, so (-1)^{n-1-k} = (-1)^{even} = 1\\n\\nSo every term in the numerator has coefficient +1, same as denominator.\\n\\nSo ratio = 1.\\n\\nSo if the number of stones in the right half is always odd, then the ratio is 1.\\n\\nIs that possible?\\n\\nWith n even, can the number in the right half be always odd?\\n\\nFor example, n=2: always 1 in right half? That would require never 0 or 2.\\n\\nBut if both stones go to right, then 2 in right half, even.\\n\\nSo unless the dynamics prevent that.\\n\\nPerhaps due to the movement rules, the stones are forced to split.\\n\\nBut the problem says Kevin picks an unstuck stone uniformly at random, so there is randomness.\\n\\nPerhaps in expectation, but the probability might allow even numbers.\\n\\nPerhaps for this specific setup, the final number in the right half has a property.\\n\\nAnother thought: perhaps the process conserves some parity.\\n\\nOr perhaps the answer is simply 1, based on the n=2 case and the structure.\\n\\nMaybe the ratio is 1 for all even n.\\n\\nPerhaps the alternating sum and the regular sum are equal due to the dynamics.\\n\\nGiven the complexity, and that the problem is likely designed to have a nice answer, and that for n=2 it is 1, and if we assume that the only way the math works is if the ratio is 1, then likely the answer is 1.\\n\\nMoreover, in the expression, if the system is symmetric and the sum excludes the tails, but the alternating sum coincidentally equals the sum, then 1.\\n\\nPerhaps the numerator is always equal to the denominator for this l=1.\\n\\nSo I think the intended answer is 1.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
