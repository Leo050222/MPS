So even if a proper subset of S sums to 10, S is invalid.\\n\\nStep 1: List all subsets of {1,2,3,4,5,6} whose elements sum to 10.\\n\\nWe find all subsets (of any size) of {1,2,3,4,5,6} with sum 10.\\n\\nTry all combinations:\\n\\n- Size 2: pairs summing to 10:\\n  - 4+6 = 10 → {4,6}\\n  - 5+5 → no\\n  - 3+7 → no\\n  → only {4,6}\\n\\n- Size 3:\\n  Try combinations:\\n  - 1+3+6 = 10 → {1,3,6}\\n  - 1+4+5 = 10 → {1,4,5}\\n  - 2+3+5 = 10 → {2,3,5}\\n  - 2+4+4 → no\\n  - 3+3+4 = 10 → {3,3,4} → invalid\\n  → valid: {1,3,6}, {1,4,5}, {2,3,5}\\n\\n- Size 4:\\n  - 1+2+3+4 = 10 → {1,2,3,4}\\n  - 1+2+2+5 → no\\n  - Any other? 1+2+7 → no\\n  → only {1,2,3,4}\\n\\n- Size 5: smallest sum is 1+2+3+4+5 = 14 > 10 → too big\\n- Size 6: 21 → too big\\n- Size 1: only if element is 10 → none\\n\\nSo all subsets that sum to 10:\\n- {4,6}\\n- {1,3,6}\\n- {1,4,5}\\n- {2,3,5}\\n- {1,2,3,4}\\n\\nSo there are 5 subsets that sum to 10.\\n\\nBut the condition is stronger: we must exclude any subset S such that **any subset of S** sums to 10.\\n\\nThat means: if S contains one of these 5 subsets as a subset, then S is invalid.\\n\\nSo we want all non-empty subsets S of {1,2,3,4,5,6} such that **none of these 5 subsets is contained in S**.\\n\\nIn other words, S must not contain any of these 'bad' subsets.\\n\\nSo we need to count all non-empty subsets S that do **not** contain any of:\\n- {4,6}\\n- {1,3,6}\\n- {1,4,5}\\n- {2,3,5}\\n- {1,2,3,4}\\n\\nThis is an inclusion-exclusion or forbidden subset problem.\\n\\nAlternatively, think: a subset S is bad if it contains at least one of these five subsets as a subset.\\n\\nLet A1 = {subsets containing {4,6}}\\nA2 = {subsets containing {1,3,6}}\\nA3 = {subsets containing {1,4,5}}\\nA4 = {subsets containing {2,3,5}}\\nA5 = {subsets containing {1,2,3,4}}\\n\\nWe want total non-empty subsets minus |A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3 ∪ A4 ∪ A5|\\n\\nTotal non-empty subsets: 2^6 - 1 = 63\\n\\nNow compute |A1 ∪ ... ∪ A5| using inclusion-exclusion.\\n\\nBut this could get messy. Alternatively, we can try to list all subsets that avoid having any of these as subsets.\\n\\nBut perhaps better: instead of inclusion-exclusion, we can try to build subsets that do not contain any of the forbidden configurations.\\n\\nBut note: the condition is that **no subset of S** sums to 10. But since any subset of S is also a subset of the full set, and we've listed all subsets of the full set that sum to 10, then the condition is equivalent to: S does not contain any of those 5 subsets as a subset.\\n\\nYes — because if a subset T ⊆ S sums to 10, then T is one of those 5 (since those are all the subsets of the whole set that sum to 10), so T ⊆ S ⇒ S contains one of the forbidden subsets.\\n\\nTherefore, S is good iff S does not contain any of the 5 subsets listed above.\\n\\nSo we want to count non-empty subsets S that do not contain any of:\\nF1 = {4,6}\\nF2 = {1,3,6}\\nF3 = {1,4,5}\\nF4 = {2,3,5}\\nF5 = {1,2,3,4}\\n\\nSo we can use inclusion-exclusion over the Ai's.\\n\\n|Ai| = number of subsets containing Fi = 2^{6 - |Fi|}, because the remaining elements can be included freely.\\n\\nSo:\\n|A1| = 2^{6-2} = 2^4 = 16  (since F1 has 2 elements)\\n|A2| = 2^{6-3} = 8\\n|A3| = 2^{3} = 8\\n|A4| = 2^{3} = 8\\n|A5| = 2^{6-4} = 2^2 = 4\\n\\nNow pairwise intersections: |Ai ∩ Aj| = subsets containing both Fi and Fj = 2^{6 - |Fi ∪ Fj|}\\n\\nWe need to compute |Fi ∪ Fj| for each pair.\\n\\nList:\\nF1 = {4,6}\\nF2 = {1,3,6}\\nF3 = {1,4,5}\\nF4 = {2,3,5}\\nF5 = {1,2,3,4}\\n\\nCompute unions:\\n\\nA1 ∩ A2: F1 ∪ F2 = {4,6} ∪ {1,3,6} = {1,3,4,6} → size 4 → 2^{2} = 4\\nA1 ∩ A3: {4,6} ∪ {1,4,5} = {1,4,5,6} → size 4 → 2^2 = 4\\nA1 ∩ A4: {4,6} ∪ {2,3,5} = {2,3,4,5,6} → size 5 → 2^1 = 2\\nA1 ∩ A5: {4,6} ∪ {1,2,3,4} = {1,2,3,4,6} → size 5 → 2^1 = 2\\nA2 ∩ A3: {1,3,6} ∪ {1,4,5} = {1,3,4,5,6} → size 5 → 2\\nA2 ∩ A4: {1,3,6} ∪ {2,3,5} = {1,2,3,5,6} → size 5 → 2\\nA2 ∩ A5: {1,3,6} ∪ {1,2,3,4} = {1,2,3,4,6} → size 5 → 2\\nA3 ∩ A4: {1,4,5} ∪ {2,3,5} = {1,2,3,4,5} → size 5 → 2\\nA3 ∩ A5: {1,4,5} ∪ {1,2,3,4} = {1,2,3,4,5} → size 5 → 2\\nA4 ∩ A5: {2,3,5} ∪ {1,2,3,4} = {1,2,3,4,5} → size 5 → 2\\n\\nAll pairwise intersections give 2^{6 - |Fi ∪ Fj|} = 2^{2}, 2^{1}, etc.\\nFrom above:\\n- A1∩A2: 4\\n- A1∩A3: 4\\n- A1∩A4: 2\\n- A1∩A5: 2\\n- A2∩A3: 2\\n- A2∩A4: 2\\n- A2∩A5: 2\\n- A3∩A4: 2\\n- A3∩A5: 2\\n- A4∩A5: 2\\n\\nSum of |Ai ∩ Aj| for i<j: let's add:\\nPairs with value 4: (1,2), (1,3) → two of them → 4+4=8\\nOthers: 8 pairs with 2 → 8×2=16\\nTotal pairwise sum: 8 + 16 = 24\\n\\nNow triple intersections: |Ai ∩ Aj ∩ Ak| = 2^{6 - |Fi ∪ Fj ∪ Fk|}\\n\\nWe need to compute for each triple.\\nThere are C(5,3)=10 triples.\\n\\nList:\\n1. A1,A2,A3: F1∪F2∪F3 = {4,6} ∪ {1,3,6} ∪ {1,4,5} = {1,3,4,5,6} → size 5 → 2^{1} = 2\\n2. A1,A2,A4: {4,6},{1,3,6},{2,3,5} → union: {1,2,3,4,5,6} → size 6 → 2^0 = 1\\n3. A1,A2,A5: {4,6},{1,3,6},{1,2,3,4} → {1,2,3,4,6} → size 5 → 2^1 = 2\\n4. A1,A3,A4: {4,6},{1,4,5},{2,3,5} → {1,2,3,4,5,6} → size 6 → 1\\n5. A1,A3,A5: {4,6},{1,4,5},{1,2,3,4} → {1,2,3,4,5,6} → 1\\n6. A1,A4,A5: {4,6},{2,3,5},{1,2,3,4} → {1,2,3,4,5,6} → 1\\n7. A2,A3,A4: {1,3,6},{1,4,5},{2,3,5} → {1,2,3,4,5,6} → 1\\n8. A2,A3,A5: {1,3,6},{1,4,5},{1,2,3,4} → {1,2,3,4,5,6} → 1\\n9.

A3,A4,A5: {1,4,5},{2,3,5},{1,2,3,4} → {1,2,3,4,5} → size 5 → 2^1 = 2\\n\\nSo the values:\\n- Triple 1: 2\\n- 2:1\\n- 3:2\\n- 4:1\\n- 5:1\\n- 6:1\\n- 7:1\\n- 8:1\\n- 9:1\\n- 10:2\\n\\nSum: 2+1+2+1+1+1+1+1+1+2 = let's see: 2+2+2+2=8, and 1's: six 1's? Wait: values: 2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,2 → that's four 2's and six 1's? No: positions: 1:2, 2:1, 3:2, 4:1,5:1,6:1,7:1,8:1,9:1,10:2 → so 2 appears at 1,3,10 → three times? 1,3,10 → yes three 2's → 3×2=6; and seven 1's? 10-3=7 → 7×1=7 → total 6+7=13\\nWait: list: 2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,2 → that's four 2's? Positions 1,3,10, and? 1:2, 3:2, 10:2 → only three? Wait index 1 to 10:\\n1:2\\n2:1\\n3:2\\n4:1\\n5:1\\n6:1\\n7:1\\n8:1\\n9:1\\n10:2 → so 2 at 1,3,10 → three times → 3×2=6\\n1 at others: 7 times → 7 → total 13\\nYes.\\n\\nSo sum of triple intersections: 13\\n\\nNow quadruple intersections: |Ai ∩ Aj ∩ Ak ∩ Al| = 2^{6 - |union of four Fi's|}\\n\\nC(5,4)=5 quadruples.\\n\\n1. A1,A2,A3,A4: F1 to F4: {4,6},{1,3,6},{1,4,5},{2,3,5} → union: all elements? 1,2,3,4,5,6 → size 6 → 2^0=1\\n2. A1,A2,A3,A5: similarly, includes F5={1,2,3,4}, F1={4,6}, F2={1,3,6}, F3={1,4,5} → has 1,2,3,4,5,6 → 1\\n3. A1,A2,A4,A5: F1={4,6}, F2={1,3,6}, F4={2,3,5}, F5={1,2,3,4} → 1,2,3,4,5,6 → 1\\n4. A1,A3,A4,A5: similar → 1\\n5. A2,A3,A4,A5: F2 to F5: {1,3,6},{1,4,5},{2,3,5},{1,2,3,4} → has 1,2,3,4,5,6? 6 is in F2 → yes → all → 1\\n\\nSo all five quadruple intersections have size 1 → sum = 5×1 = 5\\n\\nFinally, the full intersection A1∩...∩A5: subsets containing all five Fi's → but their union is full set → only the full set itself → 2^{6-6}=1 → size 1\\n\\nNow inclusion-exclusion:\\n|∪ Ai| = Σ|Ai| - Σ|Ai∩Aj| + Σ|Ai∩Aj∩Ak| - Σ|Ai∩Aj∩Al∩Am| + |A1∩...∩A5|\\n\\n= (16 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 4) - 24 + 13 - 5 + 1\\n\\nFirst sum: 16+8=24, +8=32, +8=40, +4=44\\nSo 44 - 24 = 20\\n20 + 13 = 33\\n33 - 5 = 28\\n28 + 1 = 29\\n\\nSo |∪ Ai| = 29\\n\\nTherefore, number of subsets S that contain at least one of the forbidden subsets is 29.\\n\\nBut this includes the empty set? No: each Ai consists of supersets of Fi, which are non-empty, but the superset could include extra elements, but the minimal ones are Fi, so all sets in Ai are non-empty. However, the count |Ai| = 2^{6-|Fi|} includes all supersets, including those with extra elements, but does not include the empty set. But the total number of subsets (including empty) is 64.\\n\\nBut our |Ai| counts subsets containing Fi, so they are all non-empty, and we are working in the power set.\\n\\nBut the total number of subsets that contain at least one Fi is 29, as computed.\\n\\nBut is this possible? Total subsets: 64. Number that avoid all Fi: 64 - 29 = 35, including possibly empty.\\n\\nBut we want non-empty subsets that do **not** contain any Fi, i.e., avoid all Ai.\\n\\nSo total subsets avoiding all Ai: 64 - 29 = 35\\nThis includes the empty set.\\n\\nSo non-empty subsets avoiding all Ai: 35 - 1 = 34\\n\\nBut wait: is the empty set counted in the 35? Yes, because it doesn't contain any Fi.\\n\\nAnd we want non-empty S with no subset summing to 10 → so answer should be 34?\\n\\nBut let's verify with a small example or check if inclusion-exclusion was correct.\\n\\nBut wait: inclusion-exclusion gave |∪Ai| = 29, meaning 29 subsets contain at least one Fi.\\n\\nBut let's check |A1| = 16: subsets containing {4,6}. The other elements: 1,2,3,5 can be in or out → 2^4=16, yes.\\nSimilarly, |A5|=4: subsets containing {1,2,3,4}, and 5,6 free → 2^2=4, yes.\\n\\nBut now, is there overlap? For example, a set containing both {4,6} and {1,3,6} — like {1,3,4,6} — is counted in both A1 and A2.\\n\\nBut in inclusion-exclusion we subtracted the pairwise, etc.\\n\\nBut let's compute the actual number of subsets that contain at least one of the five forbidden subsets.\\n\\nAlternatively, we can write a small mental list, but with 64 subsets, it's hard.\\n\\nBut note: the full set {1,2,3,4,5,6} contains all of them, so it's included.\\n\\nBut let's check if 29 seems reasonable.\\n\\nSum of |Ai| = 16+8+8+8+4 = 44, which is already more than half, and there are overlaps, so after inclusion-exclusion 29 seems plausible.\\n\\nBut now, the key point: are there any subsets that have a subset summing to 10 that is **not** one of these five? We assumed no, because we listed all subsets of the full set that sum to 10.\\n\\nIs that true?\\n\\nEarlier we listed:\\n- {4,6}\\n- {1,3,6}\\n- {1,4,5}\\n- {2,3,5}\\n- {1,2,3,4}\\n\\nAre there any others?\\n\\nSize 4: we had {1,2,3,4}=10\\nWhat about {1,2,7}? no\\n{1,3,5,1}? no\\n{2,3,4,1} same\\n{1,2,4,3} same\\n{1,2,5,2} no\\n{1,3,4,2} same as above\\n{1,4,5} already have\\nWhat about {2,4,4}? no\\n{3,3,4}? no\\nSize 3: we had three\\nIs {2,4,4}? no\\n{5,5}? no\\n{6,3,1} same as {1,3,6}\\n{7,3}? no\\n{8,2}? no\\n{9,1}? no\\n{10}? no\\nSize 4: {1,2,3,4}=10\\n{1,2,3,4}\\n{1,2,7}? no\\n{1,3,4,2} same\\n{1,2,4,3} same\\n{1,3,5,1} no\\n{2,3,4,1} same\\n{1,4,5} is size 3\\nWhat about {2,3,5} size 3\\nOr {4,5,1} same\\nIs there a size 4 like {1,2,3,4} only?\\n{1,2,6,1}? no\\n{1,3,5,1}? no\\n{2,4,3,1} same\\n{3,4,2,1} same\\n{1,2,4,3} same\\n{1,5,3,1}? no\\n{2,5,3} already have\\n{4,6} have\\n{5,4,1} have\\n{6,3,1} have\\n{7,2,1}=10? 7 not in set\\n{8,1,1}? no\\n{9,1}? no\\n{10}? no\\n{1,2,3,4} only size 4\\nSize 5: minimum sum 1+2+3+4+5=14>10, so no\\nSize 6: 21>10\\nSo yes, only five subsets sum to 10.\\n\\nSo our list is complete.\\n\\nThus, a subset S has a subset summing to 10 iff it contains one of these five as a subset.\\n\\nSo the count is correct: 29 subsets contain at least one of them.\\n\\nTotal subsets: 64\\nSubsets that contain none: 64 - 29 = 35 (including empty)\\nNon-empty such subsets: 35 - 1 = 34\\n\\nBut is the empty set allowed? No, the problem says S is non-empty.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 1 is 34?\\n\\nBut let's verify with a small example.\\n\\nFor instance, take S={1}. Subsets: {1}, sum=1≠10. So ok.\\nS={4,6}: sum=10, so it has a subset (itself) summing to 10, so excluded.\\nS={1,2}: subsets sum to 1,2,3, none is 10 → ok.\\nS={1,2,3,4}: sum of itself is 10 → excluded.\\nS={5}: ok.\\nS={6}: ok.\\nS={1,3,6}: sum=10 → excluded.\\n\\nNow, is there any subset that we might have miscounted?\\n\\nBut according to inclusion-exclusion, 29 bad subsets, 35 good including empty, 34 non-empty good.\\n\\nBut let me check the inclusion-exclusion calculation again.\\n\\nΣ|Ai| = |A1| + |A2| + |A3| + |A4| + |A5| = 16 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 4 = 44\\n\\nΣ|Ai ∩ Aj| for i<j: we had 10 pairs:\\n(1,2):4, (1,3):4, (1,4):2, (1,5):2, (2,3):2, (2,4):2, (2,5):2, (3,4):2, (3,5):2, (4,5):2\\nSum: 4+4=8; then eight pairs with 2? (1,4),(1,5),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5),(4,5) — that's 8, yes → 8×2=16; total 8+16=24, correct.\\n\\nTriple: we had sum 13\\nList of values: \\n(1,2,3):2, (1,2,4):1, (1,2,5):2, (1,3,4):1, (1,3,5):1, (1,4,5):1, (2,3,4):1, (2,3,5):1, (2,4,5):1, (3,4,5):2\\nSo: 2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,2 → values: 2 appears three times (1,2,3), (1,2,5), (3,4,5)? (3,4,5) is last, yes; and (1,2,3), (1,2,5) — that's three; and the rest seven are 1 → sum 3*2 + 7*1 = 6+7=13, correct.\\n\\nQuadruple: all 5 give 1 → sum 5\\nFull: 1\\n\\nSo |∪Ai| = 44 - 24 + 13 - 5 + 1 = (44-24)=20; 20+13=33; 33-5=28; 28+1=29, yes.\\n\\nSo 29 subsets contain at least one forbidden subset.\\n\\nTotal subsets: 64\\nGood subsets (no forbidden subset contained): 64 - 29 = 35\\nIncluding empty set.\\n\\nNon-empty good subsets: 35 - 1 = 34\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 1 is 34.\\n\\nBut let me confirm with another approach.\\n\\nWe can try to list all subsets that avoid the conditions.\\n\\nBut it might be time-consuming, but let's see.\\n\\nNote that if a subset contains {4,6}, it's bad. Similarly for others.\\n\\nWe can consider cases based on elements.\\n\\nBut perhaps accept 34 for now.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nFind the number of ordered triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c) such that (ab+1)(bc+1)(ca+1) = 84.\\n\\nNote: a,b,c ≥ 0 integers.\\n\\nFirst, factorize 84: 84 = 2^2 * 3 * 7\\n\\nThe product is (ab+1)(bc+1)(ca+1) = 84\\n\\nEach term ab+1, bc+1, ca+1 is an integer ≥1, since ab≥0, so ab+1≥1, similarly for others.\\n\\nSo we are to write 84 as a product of three positive integers: x=ab+1, y=bc+1, z=ca+1, such that x y z =84, and there exist nonnegative integers a,b,c with:\\nab = x-1\\nbc = y-1\\nca = z-1\\n\\nThen, multiplying all three equations: (ab)(bc)(ca) = (x-1)(y-1)(z-1)\\nLeft side: a^2 b^2 c^2 = (abc)^2\\nRight side: (x-1)(y-1)(z-1)\\nSo (abc)^2 = (x-1)(y-1)(z-1)\\nThus (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) must be a perfect square.\\n\\nAlso, from ab = x-1, bc=y-1, ca=z-1, we can multiply first and third: (ab)(ca) = (x-1)(z-1) → a^2 b c = (x-1)(z-1)\\nBut bc = y-1, so a^2 (y-1) = (x-1)(z-1)\\nSimilarly, from symmetry.\\n\\nBut perhaps easier to iterate over all ordered triples (x,y,z) of positive integers such that x y z =84, and (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) is a perfect square, and then check if there exist a,b,c ≥0 integers satisfying the equations.\\n\\nSince 84 is not too large, we can list all ordered triples.\\n\\nFirst, find all unordered ways, then consider permutations.\\n\\nBut since ordered, better to consider all divisors.\\n\\nLet d(n) be number of divisors of n.\\n84 has divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,14,21,28,42,84 → 12 divisors.\\n\\nWe can loop over x,y,z such that x y z=84.\\n\\nSince symmetric, but not completely, because the equations are cyclic.\\n\\nWe can fix x, then y, then z=84/(x y), and check if z is integer.\\n\\nx can be any divisor of 84, similarly y divisor of 84/x, but since z must be integer, y must divide 84/x.\\n\\nNumber of ordered triples: for each x|84, for each y| (84/x), then z=84/(x y) is determined and integer.\\n\\nNumber of such ordered triples: sum over x|84 of d(84/x) = sum_{d|84} d(d) , where d(k) is number of divisors of k.\\n\\nDivisors of 84: 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,14,21,28,42,84\\nd(1)=1, d(2)=2, d(3)=2, d(4)=3, d(6)=4, d(7)=2, d(12)=6, d(14)=4, d(21)=4, d(28)=6, d(42)=8, d(84)=12\\nSum: 1+2+2+3+4+2+6+4+4+6+8+12 = let's compute: 1+2=3,+2=5,+3=8,+4=12,+2=14,+6=20,+4=24,+4=28,+6=34,+8=42,+12=54\\nSo 54 ordered triples (x,y,z) with x y z=84, x,y,z≥1 integer.\\n\\nBut many will not satisfy the condition.\\n\\nWe need (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) to be a perfect square, and then solve for a,b,c.\\n\\nMoreover, from ab=x-1, bc=y-1, ca=z-1, we can find abc.\\n\\nNote that (ab)(ca)/(bc) = (x-1)(z-1)/(y-1) → a^2 = (x-1)(z-1)/(y-1)\\nSimilarly, b^2 = (x-1)(y-1)/(z-1), c^2 = (y-1)(z-1)/(x-1)\\n\\nSo for a to be integer, (x-1)(z-1)/(y-1) must be a perfect square, and nonnegative, which it is since x,y,z≥1, so x-1≥0, etc.\\n\\nSimilarly for b and c.\\n\\nMoreover, since a,b,c are nonnegative integers, we need the expressions to be perfect squares and the divisions to be exact.\\n\\nSo necessary and sufficient that:\\n1. (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) is a perfect square (which we already have from earlier, but actually this is implied by the individual conditions? Not necessarily, but in this case, since a^2 b^2 c^2 = (x-1)(y-1)(z-1), so it must be a perfect square, so that's necessary.\\n\\nBut the individual conditions are stronger.\\n\\nActually, from a^2 = (x-1)(z-1)/(y-1), etc., we need that (x-1)(z-1) is divisible by (y-1), and the result is a perfect square, similarly for others.\\n\\nBut since (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) must be a perfect square, and we have the ratios, perhaps we can check for each (x,y,z) with xyz=84, whether (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) is a perfect square, and then check if a,b,c defined by the formulas are integers.\\n\\nBut from a^2 = (x-1)(z-1)/(y-1), and since (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) is a perfect square, say k^2, then (x-1)(z-1)/(y-1) = k^2 / (y-1)^2, so a = k / (y-1), so for a to be integer, (y-1) must divide k.\\n\\nSimilarly, b = k / (z-1), c = k / (x-1)\\n\\nFrom earlier: (abc)^2 = (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) = k^2, so abc = k (since all nonnegative)\\n\\nThen from ab = x-1, so c = abc / (ab) = k / (x-1)\\nSimilarly, a = abc / (bc) = k / (y-1)? bc = y-1, so a = abc / (bc) = k / (y-1)\\nSimilarly, b = k / (z-1), c = k / (x-1)\\n\\nYes!\\nSo once we have x,y,z with xyz=84 and (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) = k^2 for some integer k≥0, then\\na = k / (y-1)\\nb = k / (z-1)\\nc = k / (x-1)\\nand these must be nonnegative integers.\\n\\nNote: if y-1=0, i.e., y=1, then a = k / 0, undefined. So we need to handle cases where some of x-1,y-1,z-1 are zero.\\n\\nCase when one of them is 1.\\n\\nSuppose y=1, then bc+1=1, so bc=0.\\nSimilarly, x=ab+1, z=ca+1.\\nAnd xyz=84, so x*1*z=84, so x z=84.\\nAnd bc=0, so either b=0 or c=0.\\n\\nSubcase b=0: then ab=0, so x=ab+1=1\\nThen x=1, z=84 (since x z=84)\\nThen ca+1=z=84, so ca=83\\nb=0\\nNow a and c: ca=83, 83 is prime, so possibilities: a=1,c=83; a=83,c=1; a=83,c=1? Or since nonnegative integers, also a=0? but ca=83, if a=0, c*0=0≠83, so a≠0, similarly c≠0.\\nSo (a,b,c) = (1,0,83) or (83,0,1)\\nCheck: for (1,0,83): ab+1=1*0+1=1=x, bc+1=0*83+1=1=y, ca+1=83*1+1=84=z, and 1*1*84=84, good.\\nSimilarly (83,0,1): ab+1=83*0+1=1, bc+1=0*1+1=1, ca+1=1*83+1=84, same.\\n\\nBut in this case, x=1,y=1,z=84\\nWe have two solutions: (a,b,c)=(1,0,83),(83,0,1)\\n\\nBut are there more? When b=0, we have x=1, z=84\\nIf c=0, but b may not be 0.\\nWe had bc=0, so either b=0 or c=0.\\nWe did b=0.\\nNow c=0: then bc=0, good.\\nca=0, so z=ca+1=1\\nThen x z = x*1=84, so x=84\\ny=1\\nThen ab+1=x=84, so ab=83\\nc=0\\nThen a and b: ab=83, prime, so (a,b)=(1,83) or (83,1)\\nSo (a,b,c)=(1,83,0) or (83,1,0)\\nCheck: (1,83,0): ab+1=1*83+1=84, bc+1=83*0+1=1, ca+1=0*1+1=1, product 84*1*1=84, good.\\nSimilarly (83,1,0): same.\\n\\nSo when y=1, we have four solutions: (1,0,83),(83,0,1),(1,83,0),(83,1,0)\\nBut in terms of (x,y,z): when y=1, and x z=84, but in the cases above:\\n- For (1,0,83): x=ab+1=1, y=bc+1=1, z=ca+1=84\\n- For (83,0,1): same x=1,y=1,z=84\\n- For (1,83,0): x=ab+1=1*83+1=84, y=bc+1=83*0+1=1, z=ca+1=0*1+1=1\\n- For (83,1,0): same x=84,y=1,z=1\\n\\nSo different (x,y,z): (1,1,84) and (84,1,1)\\n\\nSimilarly, if x=1, or z=1, we will have more.\\n\\nBut in our iteration, we need to consider all cases where one of x,y,z is 1.\\n\\nBack to the general method.\\n\\nWe need to consider all ordered triples (x,y,z) of positive integers with x y z =84.\\nFor each, compute p = (x-1)(y-1)(z-1)\\nIf p is a perfect square, then k=sqrt(p), and then a = k / (y-1), b = k / (z-1), c = k / (x-1), provided that y-1 ≠0, etc.\\nBut if y-1=0, i.e., y=1, then we cannot divide, so we handle separately.\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nSo better to handle cases where one of x,y,z is 1 separately.\\n\\nCase 1: at least one of x,y,z is 1.\\n\\nSubcase 1.1: exactly one is 1.\\nSuppose y=1, x≠1, z≠1.\\nThen as above, bc+1=1, so bc=0.\\nx z =84, x≠1,z≠1.\\nbc=0, so b=0 or c=0.\\nIf b=0, then ab=0, so x=1, contradiction since x≠1.\\nSimilarly, if c=0, then ca=0, z=1, contradiction.\\nSo impossible. Thus, if exactly one is 1, no solution.\\n\\nSubcase 1.2: exactly two are 1.\\nSuppose y=1, z=1, x≠1.\\nThen bc+1=1, ca+1=1, so bc=0, ca=0.\\nThen x*1*1=84, so x=84.\\nbc=0, ca=0.\\nNow ab+1=x=84, so ab=83.\\nbc=0, ca=0.\\nFrom ca=0, either c=0 or a=0.\\nIf a=0, then ab=0, but ab=83≠0, contradiction.\\nSo a≠0, thus c=0.\\nThen bc= b*0=0, good.\\nab=83, a≠0, so b=83/a, but ab=83, prime, so a=1,b=83 or a=83,b=1.\\nSo (a,b,c)=(1,83,0) or (83,1,0)\\nWhich we already have.\\nSimilarly, if x=1,y=1,z≠1: then ab+1=1, bc+1=1, so ab=0,bc=0.\\nz=84.\\nca+1=84, ca=83.\\nab=0, so a=0 or b=0.\\nIf b=0, then bc=0, good, but ca=83, if a=0, c*0=0≠83, contradiction.\\nIf a=0, then ab=0, good, ca= c*0=0≠83, contradiction.\\nab=0 implies a=0 or b=0.\\nca=83 requires a≠0, c≠0.\\nSo a≠0, thus from ab=0, b=0.\\nThen bc=0*c=0, good.\\nca=83, so c=83/a.\\nSince a≠0, and ab=0 is satisfied by b=0.\\nSo a can be divisor of 83, so a=1 or 83.\\nIf a=1, c=83, b=0\\nIf a=83, c=1, b=0\\nSo (a,b,c)=(1,0,83),(83,0,1)\\nSame as before.\\nSimilarly, if x=1,z=1,y≠1: then ab+1=1, ca+1=1, so ab=0, ca=0.\\ny=84.\\nbc+1=84, bc=83.\\nab=0, ca=0.\\nca=0 implies c=0 or a=0.\\nbc=83 requires b≠0,c≠0, so c≠0, thus a=0.\\nThen ab=0*b=0, good.\\nbc=83, so b=83/c, c=1 or 83.\\nIf c=1, b=83, a=0\\nIf c=83, b=1, a=0\\nSo (a,b,c)=(0,83,1),(0,1,83)\\nNew ones!\\nCheck: (0,83,1): ab+1=0*83+1=1, bc+1=83*1+1=84, ca+1=1*0+1=1, product 1*84*1=84, good.\\nSimilarly (0,1,83): ab+1=0*1+1=1, bc+1=1*83+1=84, ca+1=83*0+1=1, same.\\nSo additional solutions.\\n\\nSo when two of x,y,z are 1, we have solutions.\\nSpecifically:\\n- If x=1,y=1,z=84: gives (a,b,c)=(1,0,83),(83,0,1)\\n- If x=1,z=1,y=84: gives (0,83,1),(0,1,83)\\n- If y=1,z=1,x=84: gives (1,83,0),(83,1,0)\\n\\nSo six solutions so far.\\n\\nNow, subcase 1.3: all three x=y=z=1.\\nThen xyz=1≠84, impossible.\\n\\nSo only when exactly two are 1, and the third is 84.\\n\\nNow, Case 2: none of x,y,z is 1.

We have the six permutations of (1,2,3).\\n\\nBut are there others?\\n\\nIn the list above, we only found these six for the no-one-equal-to-1 case.\\n\\nBut perhaps we missed some (x,y,z).\\n\\nFor example, is there a triple where (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) is square, but we didn't list?\\n\\nWe listed all 21, and only six satisfied the square condition.\\n\\nBut what about when x=y=z? 84^{1/3}≈4.38, not integer.\\n\\nOr other symmetries.\\n\\nPerhaps when two are equal.\\n\\nBut we think we covered all.\\n\\nAnother possibility: if k=0, but k=sqrt((x-1)(y-1)(z-1)), so if p=0, then k=0.\\n\\np=0 when at least one of x-1,y-1,z-1 is 0, i.e., x=1 or y=1 or z=1.\\n\\nBut we already handled the cases where some are 1.\\n\\nWhen x=1, but y,z not necessarily 1.\\n\\nEarlier we only considered when at least two are 1, but what if exactly one is 1?\\n\\nSuppose x=1, y>1, z>1.\\nThen ab+1=1, so ab=0.\\nThen y z =84, since x=1.\\nbc+1=y, ca+1=z.\\nab=0, so a=0 or b=0.\\n\\nIf a=0, then ca=0, so z=1, contradiction since z>1.\\nIf b=0, then bc=0, so y=1, contradiction.\\nSo indeed, if exactly one of x,y,z is 1, no solution.\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nSo only cases are: exactly two of x,y,z are 1, or none are 1 and the product condition.\\n\\nIn the none are 1 case, we have six solutions.\\n\\nIn the two are 1 case, we have six solutions.\\n\\nBut in the two are 1 case, we have six ordered triples of (a,b,c):\\n(1,0,83),(83,0,1),(1,83,0),(83,1,0),(0,83,1),(0,1,83)\\n\\nAnd in the other case, six: permutations of (1,2,3).\\n\\nBut are there duplicates? No.\\n\\nSo total 12 solutions?\\n\\nBut let me list them:\\n1. (1,0,83)\\n2. (83,0,1)\\n3. (1,83,0)\\n4. (83,1,0)\\n5. (0,83,1)\\n6. (0,1,83)\\n7. (1,2,3)\\n8. (1,3,2)\\n9. (2,1,3)\\n10. (2,3,1)\\n11. (3,1,2)\\n12. (3,2,1)\\n\\nIs that all?\\n\\nBut earlier when we had (x,y,z)=(3,4,7) etc., we got these.\\n\\nBut is there a solution where a=b=c?\\nSuppose a=b=c, then (a^2+1)^3=84, but 84^{1/3}≈4.38, a^2+1≈4.38, a^2≈3.38, not integer.\\n\\nOr other values.\\n\\nPerhaps when (x-1)(y-1)(z-1)=0, but we handled.\\n\\nOr k=0, but if k=0, then abc=0, so at least one of a,b,c is zero.\\n\\nIf abc=0, say c=0, then from earlier, we must have y=bc+1=1, z=ca+1=1, so y=z=1, which is the case we already considered, and we have solutions only if x=84, ab=83.\\n\\nSimilarly, if a=0, then x=ab+1=1, z=ca+1=1, so x=z=1, y=84, bc=83.\\n\\nSame as before.\\n\\nSo no new solutions.\\n\\nBut in the case where none are 1, we assumed x,y,z≥2, but what if one of them is 1, but we already covered.\\n\\nAnother thought: in the formula, when we have a=k/(y-1), but if y-1=0, we handled separately.\\n\\nBut in the k=0 case, if k=0, then a=0/(y-1)=0, but only if y≠1, but if y≠1, y-1≠0, so a=0.\\n\\nBut if k=0, then (x-1)(y-1)(z-1)=0, so at least one of x,y,z is 1.\\n\\nSuppose x=1, y>1, z>1, then k=0, a=k/(y-1)=0, b=k/(z-1)=0, c=k/(x-1)=0/0 undefined.\\n\\nIndeed, as before, if x=1, y>1,z>1, then ab=0, and if a=0,b=0, then bc=0, so y=1, contradiction.\\n\\nSo no solution in that case.\\n\\nThus, only the 12 solutions we have.\\n\\nBut let me confirm if there are more.\\n\\nFor example, suppose a=2,b=2, then ab+1=5, so x=5, but 5 does not divide 84? 84/5=16.8 not integer, so z must be such that x y z=84, but y=bc+1, z=ca+1, not necessarily related directly.\\n\\nBut in our systematic approach, we covered all divisor triples.\\n\\nAnother possible solution: suppose a=4,b=1, then ab+1=5, so x=5, but 5 not divisor of 84, so in the product (ab+1)(bc+1)(ca+1)=84, each factor must be a divisor of 84 only if we assume integers, but since they are integers, and product is 84, each must be a divisor of 84 only if 84 is square-free or something, but no, for example 4 and 21, 4*21=84, but 4 does not divide 84? 84/4=21, yes it does. Actually, since they are integers and product is 84, each factor must be a divisor of 84. Is that true?\\n\\nNo! For example, 6 and 14, 6*14=84, and 6|84, 14|84, but in three factors, say 2,3,14, 2*3*14=84, and 2|84,3|84,14|84. Actually, yes, because 84 is integer, and the factors are integers, so each factor divides 84 only if the others are integers, but not necessarily. For example, could have factors 8 and 10.5, but no, since we require integers, so each factor is an integer divisor of 84? No, for example, could have 9 and 28/3, but not integer. Since the product is 84 and all are integers, each factor must be a divisor of 84 only if 84 is considered, but actually, no: for example, 6,6,84/36=7/3 not integer. But in our case, since the product is 84, and all are positive integers, then each factor must be a positive divisor of 84. Is that correct?\\n\\nYes! Because if d is a positive integer factor in a factorization of 84 into positive integers, then d must divide 84. This is true because the other factors are integers, so d divides the product 84.\\n\\nYes, so x=ab+1 must be a positive divisor of 84, similarly for y,z.\\n\\nSo our enumeration is complete: we considered all ordered triples of divisors whose product is 84.\\n\\nWe had 54 such triples, but we only checked the ones with at least two 1's or none 1's, but we need to check all where none of x,y,z is 1, but we did for the ≥2 case, and for the cases with exactly one 1, we saw no solution, and for three 1's impossible.\\n\\nBut in the ≥2 case, we found six (x,y,z) triples that work, giving six solutions.\\n\\nIn the exactly two 1's case, we have three types: (1,1,84), (1,84,1), (84,1,1), and for each, we got two (a,b,c) solutions, total six.\\n\\nSo total 12 solutions.\\n\\nBut is (1,1,84) giving two solutions, etc.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nNow, are there any other (x,y,z) with some 1's but we missed? No.\\n\\nBut in the case where (x,y,z)=(1,1,84), we have solutions, but are there (x,y,z) with different orders?\\n\\nFor example, (1,84,1), which we considered, gave (0,83,1),(0,1,83)\\n\\nAnd (84,1,1) gave (1,83,0),(83,1,0)\\n\\nSo all covered.\\n\\nNow, total 12 ordered triples (a,b,c).\\n\\nBut let me list them explicitly:\\n\\nFrom two 1's in (x,y,z):\\n- (x,y,z)=(1,1,84): (a,b,c)=(1,0,83),(83,0,1)\\n- (x,y,z)=(1,84,1): (a,b,c)=(0,83,1),(0,1,83)\\n- (x,y,z)=(84,1,1): (a,b,c)=(1,83,0),(83,1,0)\\n\\nFrom no 1's:\\n- (3,4,7): (2,1,3)\\n- (3,7,4): (1,2,3)\\n- (4,3,7): (3,1,2)\\n- (4,7,3): (1,3,2)\\n- (7,3,4): (3,2,1)\\n- (7,4,3): (2,3,1)\\n\\nAll distinct.\\n\\nSo 6 + 6 = 12.\\n\\nBut is there a solution where a=b=c=0? Then (1)(1)(1)=1≠84, no.\\n\\nOr other values.\\n\\nPerhaps when ab+1=2, etc.\\n\\nFor example, suppose ab+1=2, so ab=1, so a=1,b=1 (since nonnegative integers).\\nThen (2)(bc+1)(ca+1)=84, so (bc+1)(ca+1)=42.\\nNow b=1,c arbitrary, a=1.\\nSo bc+1=c+1, ca+1=c+1, so (c+1)^2=42, not integer.\\n\\nOr ab+1=3, ab=2, so (a,b)=(1,2) or (2,1)\\nSay a=1,b=2, then (3)(2c+1)(c*1+1)=84, so (2c+1)(c+1)=28\\nLet u=c, (2u+1)(u+1)=2u^2+3u+1=28, so 2u^2+3u-27=0, discriminant 9+216=225=15^2, u=( -3±15)/4, u=12/4=3 or u=-18/4 not integer. So u=3, c=3.\\nThen (a,b,c)=(1,2,3), which is already in our list.\\nSimilarly for other cases.\\n\\nSo no new solutions.\\n\\nThus, total 12 ordered triples.\\n\\nBut in the list, we have (1,2,3) and permutations, and the ones with zeros.\\n\\nNow, back to Problem 1, we had 34.\\n\\nBut let me double-check Problem 1.\\n\\nIn Problem 1, we concluded 34, but let me see if the empty set is the only one missing.\\n\\nTotal subsets: 64\\nBad subsets: 29\\nGood subsets: 35, including empty\\nNon-empty good: 34\\n\\nBut is there a subset that contains a subset summing to 10 but not one of the five? We think not.\\n\\nFor example, take S={1,2,3,4,5}, sum is 15, but it contains {1,2,3,4} which sums to 10, so it should be excluded, and in our count, since it contains F5={1,2,3,4}, it is in A5, so counted in the 29.\\n\\nTake S={5,5}, but no duplicate.\\n\\nOr S={10}, not in set.\\n\\nAnother subset: is {2,8}? no 8.\\n\\nOr {1,9}? no.\\n\\nSo yes.\\n\\nPerhaps we can compute the number directly.\\n\\nBut I think 34 is correct.\\n\\nSo answers:\\nProblem 1: 34\\nProblem 2: 12\\n\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"34\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
