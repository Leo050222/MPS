We aim to find two lines of symmetry of its graph.\\n\\nStep 1: Analyze symmetry. \\nNote that:\\n$$\\nf(-x) = -x + \\\\frac{1}{-x} = -\\\\left(x + \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) = -f(x)\\n$$\\nSo the function is odd, meaning it is symmetric about the origin. This suggests possible symmetry across lines through the origin.\\n\\nBut we are to find lines of symmetry in the form $ y = ax + b $. Since the function is defined for $ x \\\\ne 0 $, and has a graph with two branches (for $ x > 0 $ and $ x < 0 $), let's explore potential symmetries.\\n\\nTry reflection over the line $ y = x $:\\nIf a point $ (a, b) $ lies on the graph, so $ b = a + \\\\frac{1}{a} $, then the reflection over $ y = x $ is $ (b, a) $. For this to lie on the graph, we need:\\n$$\\na = b + \\\\frac{1}{b}\\n$$\\nBut from $ b = a + \\\\frac{1}{a} $, substitute:\\n$$\\na = \\\\left(a + \\\\frac{1}{a}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{a + \\\\frac{1}{a}}\\n$$\\nThis does not hold in general, so not symmetric about $ y = x $?\\nWait — reconsider.\\n\\nAlternatively, suppose we consider the transformation $ x \\\\to \\\\frac{1}{x} $. Then:\\n$$\\ny = x + \\\\frac{1}{x} = \\\\frac{1}{x} + x\\n$$\\nSo if $ (a, b) $ is on the graph, then so is $ \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{a}, b\\\\right) $? No: if $ x = \\\\frac{1}{a} $, then $ y = \\\\frac{1}{a} + a = b $, same value. So yes!\\nThus, if $ (a, b) $ is on the graph, then $ \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{a}, b\\\\right) $ is also on the graph. So the graph is symmetric with respect to the transformation $ x \\\\to \\\\frac{1}{x} $, keeping $ y $ fixed.\\n\\nBut how does this translate to geometric symmetry?\\nThe midpoint of $ (a, b) $ and $ \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{a}, b\\\\right) $ is:\\n$$\\n\\\\left( \\\\frac{a + \\\\frac{1}{a}}{2}, b \\\\right) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{y}{2}, b \\\\right)\\n$$\\nand both points have same $ y $, so the perpendicular bisector is vertical? Not helpful.\\n\\nAlternatively, consider that the map $ x \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{1}{x} $ corresponds to an involution. The combination of $ x \\\\mapsto -x $ and $ x \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{1}{x} $ may yield symmetries.\\n\\nLet’s test symmetry about the line $ y = x $:\\nSuppose $ (a, b) $ is on the graph: $ b = a + \\\\frac{1}{a} $\\nThen the reflection of $ (a,b) $ over $ y = x $ is $ (b,a) $\\nWe want $ a = b + \\\\frac{1}{b} $? Let's check:\\nFrom $ b = a + \\\\frac{1}{a} $, multiply both sides by $ a $: $ ab = a^2 + 1 $\\nWe want $ a = b + \\\\frac{1}{b} = \\\\frac{b^2 + 1}{b} \\\\Rightarrow ab = b^2 + 1 $\\nSo we need $ a^2 + 1 = b^2 + 1 \\\\Rightarrow a^2 = b^2 $, which is not generally true.\\nSo no.\\n\\nNow try symmetry about $ y = -x $:\\nReflection of $ (a,b) $ over $ y = -x $ is $ (-b, -a) $\\nWe want $ -a = -b + \\\\frac{1}{-b} = -b - \\\\frac{1}{b} \\\\Rightarrow a = b + \\\\frac{1}{b} $\\nAgain, same condition as before.\\n\\nWait — go back to functional symmetry.\\nWe know:\\n- $ f(-x) = -f(x) $: rotational symmetry of 180° about the origin.\\nThis implies that the graph is symmetric under rotation by 180°, so the origin is a center of symmetry.\\nBut rotational symmetry of 180° implies that the lines through the origin at any angle are not necessarily lines of reflection symmetry — unless more is present.\\n\\nBut perhaps there are reflection symmetries.\\nTry substitution: let’s suppose the graph is symmetric about the line $ y = x $.\\nAs above, doesn’t work.\\nWhat about $ y = -x $?\\nTake a point $ (a, a + 1/a) $. Its reflection over $ y = -x $:\\nThe formula for reflection of point $ (x,y) $ over $ y = -x $ is $ (-y, -x) $\\nSo image is $ (- (a + 1/a), -a ) $\\nNow plug into function: does $ y = x + 1/x $ hold at $ x = - (a + 1/a) $?\\nCompute:\\n$$\\nx + \\\\frac{1}{x} = -\\\\left(a + \\\\frac{1}{a}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{ - (a + 1/a) } = -\\\\left(a + \\\\frac{1}{a}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{1}{a + 1/a}\\n$$\\nCompare to $ y = -a $ — is this equal?\\nIs:\\n$$\\n-\\\\left(a + \\\\frac{1}{a}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{1}{a + 1/a} = -a ?\\n\\\\Rightarrow -a - \\\\frac{1}{a} - \\\\frac{1}{a + 1/a} = -a\\n\\\\Rightarrow -\\\\frac{1}{a} - \\\\frac{1}{a + 1/a} = 0\\n$$\\nWhich is false.\\nSo not symmetric over $ y = -x $.\\n\\nAlternative idea: consider the parametrization. Let $ x = t $, then $ y = t + 1/t $\\nThen also when $ x = 1/t $, $ y = 1/t + t = y $, same y.\\nAnd when $ x = -t $, $ y = -t -1/t = -y $\\nWhen $ x = -1/t $, $ y = -1/t - t = -y $\\nSo the four points:\\n- $ (t, t + 1/t) $\\n- $ (1/t, t + 1/t) $\\n- $ (-t, -t -1/t) $\\n- $ (-1/t, -t -1/t) $\\nare all on the graph.\\n\\nNow look for reflection symmetries.\\nSuppose we consider the line $ y = x $. Take point $ (t, t+1/t) $. Its reflection is $ (t+1/t, t) $\\nFor this to be on the graph, we need $ y = x + 1/x $ at $ x = t+1/t $:\\n$$\\nx + \\\\frac{1}{x} = (t + 1/t) + \\\\frac{1}{t + 1/t}\\n$$\\nWe want this to equal $ t $? Unlikely.\\n\\nWait — perhaps the graph is symmetric about $ y = x $ and $ y = -x $? Let's test numerically.\\nTake $ t = 2 $: then $ y = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 $, so point $ (2, 2.5) $\\nIs $ (2.5, 2) $ on the graph? Compute $ y = 2.5 + 1/2.5 = 2.5 + 0.4 = 2.9 \\\\ne 2 $. No.\\n\\nTry $ t = 1 $: $ (1,2) $, reflection over $ y=x $ is $ (2,1) $, but $ 2 + 1/2 = 2.5 \\\\ne 1 $. No.\\n\\nAnother idea: since $ f(1/x) = 1/x + x = f(x) $, so $ y $ is invariant under $ x \\\\to 1/x $. So the graph is symmetric with respect to the transformation $ x \\\\leftrightarrow 1/x $, which is an involution.\\nGeometrically, what line is preserved under $ x \\\\leftrightarrow 1/x $ combined with identity on y?\\nThe transformation $ (x,y) \\\\to (1/x, y) $ is not a Euclidean reflection unless composed properly.\\nBut note that if $ (a, b) $ and $ (1/a, b) $ are both on the graph, then the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining them is a candidate for symmetry line only if the transformation is reflection.\\nMidpoint: $ \\\\left( \\\\frac{a + 1/a}{2}, b \\\\right) = (y/2, b) $\\nSlope of segment: vertical? No, same y, so horizontal segment. So perpendicular bisector is vertical line $ x = \\\\frac{a + 1/a}{2} = y/2 $\\nBut this depends on the point — not a fixed line.\\nSo not a global symmetry line.\\n\\nBut wait — another symmetry: $ x \\\\to -x $ gives $ y \\\\to -y $, so $ (x,y) \\\\to (-x,-y) $, which is rotation by 180° about origin.\\nThis is a symmetry, but not a reflection.\\nHowever, a 180° rotational symmetry can be expressed as composition of two reflections. But we need reflection symmetries.\\n\\nLet’s consider the possibility that the graph is symmetric about the lines $ y = x $ and $ y = -x $. Even though earlier calculation failed, let's reevaluate.\\nWait — actually, consider the function $ xy = x^2 + 1 $, from $ y = x + 1/x \\\\Rightarrow xy = x^2 + 1 $\\nMultiply both sides by x: $ x y = x^2 + 1 $\\nSo $ x^2 - x y + 1 = 0 $\\nThis is a quadratic in x and y.\\nAlternatively, write as:\\n$$\\nx^2 - x y + 1 = 0\\n$$\\nBut better to eliminate: from $ y = x + 1/x $, multiply by x: $ x y = x^2 + 1 $, so:\\n$$\\nx^2 - x y + 1 = 0\\n$$\\nThis is not symmetric.\\n\\nConsider swapping x and y: if we swap, we get $ y^2 - y x + 1 = 0 $, which is the same equation! Because $ x^2 - x y + 1 = 0 $ becomes $ y^2 - y x + 1 = 0 $, which is identical since multiplication is commutative.\\nWait — no: the original relation is $ y = x + 1/x $, which implies $ x y = x^2 + 1 $, i.e.,\\n$$\\nx^2 - x y + 1 = 0\\n$$\\nIf we swap x and y, we get:\\n$$\\ny^2 - y x + 1 = 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{or} \\\\quad y^2 - x y + 1 = 0\\n$$\\nWhich is different from the original unless $ x^2 = y^2 $.\\nBut notice: the set of points satisfying $ y = x + 1/x $ is the same as those satisfying $ x = y + 1/y $? Let's see.\\nSuppose $ x = y + 1/y $, then is $ y = x + 1/x $? Not necessarily.\\nBut from $ y = x + 1/x $, can we derive $ x = y + 1/y $? Generally no.\\n\\nHowever, let's solve: from $ y = x + 1/x $, multiply: $ x y = x^2 + 1 \\\\Rightarrow x^2 - x y + 1 = 0 $\\nSimilarly, if we consider the inverse relation, solving for x in terms of y:\\n$ x^2 - y x + 1 = 0 $, so $ x = [y ± sqrt(y^2 - 4)]/2 $\\nThen $ y = x + 1/x $ holds.\\nBut the graph is symmetric with respect to interchange of x and y if and only if whenever $ (a,b) $ is on the graph, so is $ (b,a) $.\\nSo is $ (b,a) $ on the graph? That would require $ a = b + 1/b $\\nBut we have $ b = a + 1/a $\\nSo we need $ a = (a + 1/a) + 1/(a + 1/a) $\\nCompute right-hand side:\\n$ a + 1/a + 1/(a + 1/a) = a + 1/a + a/(a^2 + 1) $\\n= $ a + \\\\frac{1}{a} + \\\\frac{a}{a^2 + 1} $\\nThis equals a only if $ \\\\frac{1}{a} + \\\\frac{a}{a^2 + 1} = 0 $, impossible for real a ≠ 0.\\nSo not symmetric over y=x.\\n\\nWait — perhaps I made a mistake. Let's plot mentally.\\nFor large x, y ≈ x; for x near 0+, y → ∞; minimum at x=1, y=2; maximum at x=-1, y=-2.\\nThe graph has a branch in first quadrant (U-shaped, min at (1,2)), and third quadrant (inverted, max at (-1,-2)).\\nDue to oddness, it's symmetric under 180° rotation.\\nNow, is there a reflection symmetry?\\nConsider the line y = x: the point (1,2) reflects to (2,1). Is (2,1) on the graph? y = 2 + 1/2 = 2.5 ≠ 1. No.\\nLine y = -x: (1,2) reflects to (-2,-1). Check x=-2: y = -2 -0.5 = -2.5 ≠ -1. No.\\n\\nBut earlier we saw that if (a, b) is on the graph, so is (1/a, b). For example, a=2, b=2.5, then 1/a=0.5, y=0.5 + 2 = 2.5, yes. So (0.5, 2.5) is also on the graph.\\nSimilarly, (-2, -2.5) and (-0.5, -2.5) are on the graph.\\nNow, the segment from (2,2.5) to (0.5,2.5) is horizontal. Midpoint is ((2+0.5)/2, 2.5) = (1.25, 2.5)\\nPerpendicular bisector is vertical line x=1.25, but this is not a fixed line for all points.\\n\\nHowever, notice that the transformation $ x \\\\to 1/x $, y unchanged, is not a Euclidean isometry unless we consider other geometries.\\nBut perhaps the graph is symmetric with respect to the line x = y in a different way?\\nWait — let's consider the following: suppose we reflect over the line y = x, then apply some other transformation.\\nAlternatively, recall that for the function $ y = x + 1/x $, it is known that it has two lines of symmetry: y = x and y = -x? Or perhaps y=2x?\\nWait, let's search for fixed lines.\\nSuppose the line of symmetry is y = kx.\\nThen reflecting a point (a, a+1/a) over y=kx should give another point on the graph.\\nThe formula for reflection of a point (x,y) over the line y = kx is known.\\nBut this is messy.\\n\\nAlternative insight: make a change of variables.\\nLet $ u = x + \\\\frac{1}{x} $, $ v = x - \\\\frac{1}{x} $\\nThen $ u = y $, and $ v = x - 1/x $\\nThen $ u^2 = x^2 + 2 + 1/x^2 $, $ v^2 = x^2 - 2 + 1/x^2 $, so $ u^2 - v^2 = 4 $\\nThus $ y^2 - v^2 = 4 $, but v is not a coordinate.\\nIn terms of x and y, we have y = x + 1/x, so y is given.\\nBut the relation $ (x + 1/x)^2 - (x - 1/x)^2 = 4 $, which is identity.\\nNot helpful.\\n\\nWait — consider rotating the coordinate system.\\nSuppose we rotate by 45 degrees, since y=x is at 45 degrees.\\nLet\\n$$\\nx = \\\\frac{X - Y}{\\\\sqrt{2}}, \\\\quad y = \\\\frac{X + Y}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\n$$\\nThen substitute into $ y = x + 1/x $:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{X + Y}{\\\\sqrt{2}} = \\\\frac{X - Y}{\\\\sqrt{2}} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{X - Y}{\\\\sqrt{2}}} = \\\\frac{X - Y}{\\\\sqrt{2}} + \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{X - Y}\\n$$\\nMultiply both sides by $ \\\\sqrt{2} $:\\n$$\\nX + Y = X - Y + \\\\frac{2}{X - Y}\\n\\\\Rightarrow 2Y = \\\\frac{2}{X - Y}\\n\\\\Rightarrow Y(X - Y) = 1\\n\\\\Rightarrow X Y - Y^2 = 1\\n$$\\nSo in rotated coordinates, the equation is $ X Y - Y^2 = 1 $, or $ Y(X - Y) = 1 $\\nThis is not obviously symmetric.\\n\\nAlternatively, after research or prior knowledge, it is known that the graph of $ y = x + 1/x $ is a hyperbola, and hyperbolas have two lines of symmetry: the asymptotes or the axes.\\nThe asymptotes are y = x and y = -x? As x→∞, y~x, so y=x is an asymptote. But is it a line of symmetry?\\nFor a hyperbola, the lines of symmetry are the transverse and conjugate axes.\\nIn this case, the function has a vertical asymptote at x=0 and oblique asymptote y=x.\\nBut typically, for a rectangular hyperbola, symmetry lines are at 45 degrees.\\nIndeed, the standard hyperbola xy=1 has symmetry lines y=x and y=-x.\\nBut our function is y = x + 1/x, which can be written as x y = x^2 + 1, or x^2 - x y + 1 = 0.\\nCompare to the hyperbola.\\nLet me write it as:\\n$$\\ny = x + \\\\frac{1}{x} \\\\implies y - x = \\\\frac{1}{x}\\n$$\\nThen $ (y - x) x = 1 $\\nSo $ x(y - x) = 1 $\\nSimilarly, $ x y - x^2 = 1 $\\nNow let u = x, v = y - x, then u v = 1, which is a hyperbola in u-v plane.\\nThe lines u=0 and v=0 are asymptotes, but symmetry lines for uv=1 are u=v and u=-v, i.e., x = y - x and x = - (y - x)\\nFirst: x = y - x => y = 2x\\nSecond: x = -y + x => 0 = -y => y=0\\nNot likely.\\nIn the u-v plane, the hyperbola uv=1 has symmetry lines u=v and u=-v.\\nSo in x-y coordinates:\\nu = x, v = y - x\\nu = v => x = y - x => y = 2x\\nu = -v => x = - (y - x) = -y + x => 0 = -y => y = 0\\nSo lines y=2x and y=0.\\nIs the graph symmetric about y=0? No, because for x>0, y>0 in first quadrant.\\nAbout y=2x? Let's test.\\nTake point (1,2): lies on y=2x? 2=2*1, yes, it's on the line.\\nAnother point (2,2.5): reflection over y=2x.\\nFormula for reflection over y=2x.\\nGeneral formula for reflection over y = mx.\\nm=2.\\nThe formula is:\\n$$\\nx' = \\\\frac{(1-m^2)x + 2m y}{1+m^2}, \\\\quad y' = \\\\frac{2m x + (m^2-1)y}{1+m^2}\\n$$\\nFor m=2, 1+m^2=5\\nx' = [ (1-4)x + 4y ] / 5 = (-3x + 4y)/5\\ny' = [4x + (4-1)y]/5 = (4x + 3y)/5\\nTake (2,2.5):\\nx' = (-6 + 10)/5 = 4/5 = 0.8\\ny' = (8 + 7.5)/5 = 15.5/5 = 3.1\\nNow check if (0.8, 3.1) is on the graph: compute y = 0.8 + 1/0.8 = 0.8 + 1.25 = 2.05 ≠ 3.1. No.\\nSo not.\\n\\nPerhaps I need to think differently.\\nBack to the property: if (a,b) is on the graph, so is (1/a, b), and (-a, -b), and (-1/a, -b).\\nNow, consider the line y = x. Does it relate these points?\\nTake (a, a+1/a) and (1/a, a+1/a). The line joining them is horizontal.\\nBut also, the point (a, a+1/a) and (a+1/a, a) — but the latter may not be on the graph.\\nUnless a = 1/a, i.e., a=±1.\\nAt a=1, (1,2), and (2,1) not on graph.\\n\\nAnother idea: the two lines of symmetry might be y = x and y = -x after all, but for a different reason.\\nUpon searching my memory, I recall that the function f(x) = x + 1/x is symmetric with respect to the origin (odd), and also has symmetry under x -> 1/x, but that's not a reflection.\\nHowever, the combination might give reflections.\\nSpecifically, the transformation x -> 1/x is not a Euclidean isometry, but in the context of the graph, it might correspond to a reflection.\\nAfter research in mind, I recall that for the curve y = x + 1/x, the lines of symmetry are y = x and y = -x.\\nLet me verify with a point.\\nTake (2, 2.5). Reflect over y = x: get (2.5, 2). Is (2.5,2) on the graph? Compute y = 2.5 + 1/2.5 = 2.5 + 0.4 = 2.9 ≠ 2. No.\\nReflect over y = -x: (2,2.5) -> (-2.5, -2). Compute at x=-2.5: y = -2.5 - 0.4 = -2.9 ≠ -2. No.\\n\\nPerhaps it's y = 2x and y = -2x? At (1,2), on y=2x.\\n(2,2.5): reflect over y=2x.\\nAs before, didn't work.\\n\\nWait — perhaps the lines are x=0 and y=x, but x=0 is vertical, not of the form y=ax+b.\\nMust be non-vertical.\\n\\nAnother thought: since the function is odd, and also f(1/x) = f(x), then the graph is invariant under the transformation (x,y) -> (1/x, y) and (x,y) -> (-x, -y).\\nThe composition of these might give a reflection.\\nFor example, (x,y) -> (1/x, y) -> (-1/x, -y)\\nOr (x,y) -> (-x,-y) -> (-1/x, -y) wait no.\\nDefine T1: (x,y) -> (1/x, y)\\nT2: (x,y) -> (-x, -y)\\nThen T2 o T1: (x,y) -> (1/x, y) -> (-1/x, -y)\\nAnd this is on the graph, as we know.\\nBut is either T1 or T2 a reflection? T2 is rotation by 180 degrees, not reflection.\\nT1 is not an isometry.\\n\\nPerhaps the reflection is over the line x=1 or something, but not through origin.\\nLet's assume the line of symmetry is y = x, even though numerical check fails.\\nPerhaps I miscalculated.\\nAnother idea: the two lines are y = x and y = -x, but for the hyperbola in standard form.\\nLet's write the equation as:\\nFrom y = x + 1/x, multiply by x: x y = x^2 + 1\\nSo x^2 - x y + 1 = 0\\nThis is a quadratic curve. General conic section: A x^2 + B xy + C y^2 + D x + E y + F = 0\\nHere: 1 x^2 -1 xy + 0 y^2 + 0 x + 0 y + 1 = 0\\nSo A=1, B=-1, C=0, D=0, E=0, F=1\\nDiscriminant B^2 - 4AC = 1 - 0 = 1 >0, so hyperbola.\\nFor a hyperbola, the lines of symmetry are the angle bisectors of the asymptotes.\\nFirst, find asymptotes.\\nAs x->0, y->±∞; as x->±∞, y->x.\\nSo asymptotes are x=0 (vertical) and y=x (oblique).\\nThe asymptotes are x=0 and y=x.\\nThe angle between them is 45 degrees.\\nThe angle bisectors can be found.\\nThe two asymptotes: one is vertical (undefined slope), one is y=x (slope 1).\\nThe angle bisectors in the plane for two lines with slopes m1 and m2 are given by a formula.\\nSince one is vertical, say x=0, and the other is y=x.\\nThe angles: the vertical line has angle 90°, y=x has angle 45°, so the bisectors should be at (45+90)/2 = 67.5° and the other at 67.5+90=157.5°, but since they are perpendicular? No, 45 and 90 differ by 45 degrees, so bisectors at 45 + 22.5 = 67.5° and 90 + 22.5 = 112.5°? Let's calculate properly.\\nFor two lines with equations L1=0 and L2=0, the angle bisectors are given by |L1|/||L1|| = |L2|/||L2||.\\nAsymptotes: x=0 and y-x=0.\\nSo the angle bisectors are given by:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{|x|}{\\\\sqrt{1^2}} = \\\\frac{|y - x|}{\\\\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = \\\\frac{|y - x|}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\n$$\\nSo |x| = |y - x| / sqrt(2)\\nThus sqrt(2) |x| = |y - x|\\nSo two cases:\\n1. sqrt(2) x = y - x  => y = x + sqrt(2) x = x(1 + sqrt(2))\\n2. sqrt(2) x = - (y - x) => sqrt(2) x = -y + x => y = x - sqrt(2) x = x(1 - sqrt(2))\\nAnd for negative x, but absolute values, so we need to consider signs, but typically this gives four rays, but the equations are:\\nFrom |A| = |B| implies A= B or A= -B, but here it's scaled.\\nFrom sqrt(2) |x| = |y - x|, so we have:\\n- sqrt(2) x = y - x if x<0, etc., but better to square both sides to avoid cases.\\nFrom sqrt(2) |x| = |y - x|, square both sides:\\n2 x^2 = (y - x)^2\\nSo 2x^2 = y^2 - 2x y + x^2\\n=> 2x^2 - x^2 + 2x y - y^2 = 0\\n=> x^2 + 2x y - y^2 = 0\\nThis is the equation of the angle bisectors.\\nNow, this factors as a quadratic.\\nSolve for y in terms of x:\\ny^2 - 2x y - x^2 = 0? From x^2 + 2x y - y^2 = 0, so -y^2 + 2x y + x^2 = 0, multiply by -1: y^2 - 2x y - x^2 = 0\\nThen y = [2x ± sqrt(4x^2 + 4x^2)]/2 = [2x ± sqrt(8x^2)]/2 = [2x ± 2√2 x]/2 = x(1 ± √2)\\nSo the two lines are y = (1+√2)x and y = (1-√2)x\\nThese are the lines of symmetry for the hyperbola.\\nBut the problem asks for two lines of symmetry, and to express as y=ax+b.\\nHere b=0.\\nBut is this correct for our function?\\nLet me verify with a point.\\nTake x=1, y=2.\\nDistance to line y=(1+√2)x and y=(1-√2)x.\\nBut easier to see if the graph is symmetric with respect to these lines.\\nSince it's a hyperbola, and these are the angle bisectors of the asymptotes, yes, they are the lines of symmetry.\\nBut the problem likely expects simple answers, and moreover, for y=x+1/x, common knowledge might be different.\\nMoreover, (1-√2) is negative, about -0.414, and (1+√2)≈2.414.\\nTake point (1,2). Reflect over y=(1+√2)x.\\nThis is complicated.\\nBut let's accept that for now.\\nHowever, the problem might expect y=x and y= -x, but our calculation shows otherwise.\\nAnother way: perhaps due to the oddness, the origin is on the symmetry lines, so b=0.\\nAnd from the conic section, the lines of symmetry pass through the center.\\nFind the center of the hyperbola.\\nFor the conic x^2 - x y + 1 = 0, the center is found by solving partial derivatives.\\nLet F(x,y) = x^2 - x y + 1\\n∂F/∂x = 2x - y = 0\\n∂F/∂y = -x = 0\\nSo x=0, then 2*0 - y=0 => y=0\\nBut (0,0) is not on the graph, and moreover, at (0,0), F=1≠0, but the center should satisfy the system:\\nFor conic Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0, the center (h,k) satisfies:\\n2Ah + Bk + D = 0\\nBh + 2Ck + E = 0\\nHere A=1, B=-1, C=0, D=0, E=0, F=1\\nSo:\\n2(1)h + (-1)k + 0 = 0 => 2h - k = 0\\n(-1)h + 2(0)k + 0 = 0 => -h = 0\\nSo h=0, then k=0.\\nSo center at (0,0).\\nTherefore, any line of symmetry must pass through (0,0), so b=0 in y=ax+b.\\nSo the lines are of the form y=ax.\\nNow, for the hyperbola to be symmetric about y=ax, the reflection of any point on the graph over the line should be on the graph.\\nTake a general point (t, t + 1/t) on the graph.\\nIts reflection over the line y = ax.\\nThe formula for reflection of point (x,y) over y=ax is:\\nLet m=a.\\nThen the reflection (x',y') is given by:\\nx' = \\frac{(1-m^2)x + 2m y}{1+m^2}\\ny' = \\frac{2m x + (m^2-1)y}{1+m^2}\\nNow, this point (x',y') should satisfy y' = x' + 1/x' for all t.\\nSo substitute x=t, y=t+1/t.\\nx' = [ (1-a^2) t + 2a (t + 1/t) ] / (1+a^2) = [ (1-a^2)t + 2a t + 2a/t ] / (1+a^2) = [ t(1-a^2 + 2a) + 2a/t ] / (1+a^2)\\ny' = [ 2a t + (a^2-1)(t + 1/t) ] / (1+a^2) = [ 2a t + (a^2-1)t + (a^2-1)/t ] / (1+a^2) = [ t(2a + a^2 -1) + (a^2-1)/t ] / (1+a^2)\\nNow, we need y' = x' + 1/x'\\nThis must hold for all t ≠ 0.\\nLet P = 1+a^2, for simplicity.\\nSo x' = [ A t + B/t ] / P, where A = 1-a^2 + 2a, B = 2a\\ny' = [ C t + D/t ] / P, where C = a^2 + 2a -1, D = a^2 -1\\nNow, x' + 1/x' = [A t + B/t]/P + 1 / ( [A t + B/t]/P ) = [A t + B/t]/P + P / (A t + B/t)\\n= (1/P) (A t + B/t) + P / (A t + B/t)\\nThis should equal y' = (1/P) (C t + D/t)\\nMultiply both sides by P (A t + B/t) to clear denominators.\\nBut this must hold for all t, so perhaps equate coefficients.\\nNotice that x' + 1/x' is not a rational function in the same way, but for the equality to hold for all t, the only way is if the expression matches.\\nAssume that for the specific a, the point (x',y') is on the graph, so y' = x' + 1/x'\\nSo (C t + D/t)/P = (A t + B/t)/P + 1 / ( (A t + B/t)/P ) = (A t + B/t)/P + P / (A t + B/t)\\nMultiply both sides by P:\\nC t + D/t = A t + B/t + P^2 / (A t + B/t)\\nNow multiply both sides by (A t + B/t):\\n(C t + D/t) (A t + B/t) = (A t + B/t)^2 + P^2\\nLeft side: C t * A t + C t * B/t + (D/t)*A t + (D/t)*(B/t) = A C t^2 + B C + A D + B D / t^2\\n= AC t^2 + (BC + AD) + BD / t^2\\nRight side: (A t + B/t)^2 + P^2 = A^2 t^2 + 2A B + B^2 / t^2 + P^2\\nSo we have:\\nAC t^2 + (BC + AD) + BD / t^2 = A^2 t^2 + (2AB + P^2) + B^2 / t^2\\nThis must hold for all t, so equate coefficients of like powers.\\nCoefficient of t^2: AC = A^2\\nCoefficient of t^0: BC + AD = 2AB + P^2\\nCoefficient of t^{-2}: BD = B^2\\nAlso, P = 1+a^2\\nRecall:\\nA = 1 - a^2 + 2a = (1 + 2a - a^2)\\nB = 2a\\nC = a^2 + 2a - 1\\nD = a^2 - 1\\nP = 1 + a^2\\nNow, from BD = B^2:\\nB D = B^2 => B(D - B) = 0\\nSo either B=0 or D=B\\nB=2a, so a=0 or D=B\\nIf a=0, then the line is y=0.\\nCheck: is the graph symmetric about y=0? No, because for x>0, y>0 for |x|>1, etc.\\nSo a≠0, thus D=B\\nD = a^2 - 1, B=2a, so a^2 - 1 = 2a\\na^2 - 2a - 1 = 0\\na = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 4)]/2 = [2 ± sqrt(8)]/2 = [2 ± 2√2]/2 = 1 ± √2\\nNow, also from AC = A^2, so A(C - A) = 0, so A=0 or C=A\\nLet's check for a = 1+√2 and a=1-√2\\nFirst, a = 1+√2\\nThen A = 1 + 2(1+√2) - (1+√2)^2 = 1 + 2 + 2√2 - (1 + 2√2 + 2) = 3 + 2√2 - (3 + 2√2) = 0\\nSimilarly, C = (1+√2)^2 + 2(1+√2) -1 = (1+2√2+2) + 2+2√2 -1 = (3+2√2) +2+2√2 -1 = 4 + 4√2\\nBut A=0, so AC=A^2=0, good.\\nNow check the constant term condition.\\nSince A=0 for a=1+√2, let's use that.\\nSimilarly for a=1-√2: A = 1 + 2(1-√2) - (1-√2)^2 = 1 + 2 - 2√2 - (1 - 2√2 + 2) = 3 - 2√2 - (3 - 2√2) = 0\\nSo for both a=1±√2, A=0.\\nNow, when A=0, the earlier expressions simplify.\\nx' = [ 0*t + 2a / t ] / (1+a^2) = (2a / t) / (1+a^2) = 2a / [t (1+a^2)]\\ny' = [ C t + D/t ] / (1+a^2)\\nBut C = a^2 + 2a -1, D=a^2-1\\nNow, we need to verify the middle coefficient condition.\\nFrom earlier, when A=0, the equation was:\\nAC t^2 + (BC + AD) + BD / t^2 = A^2 t^2 + (2AB + P^2) + B^2 / t^2\\nWith A=0, left side: 0 + (B C + 0) + B D / t^2 = B C + B D / t^2\\nRight side: 0 + (0 + P^2) + B^2 / t^2 = P^2 + B^2 / t^2\\nSo we need:\\nB C = P^2\\nand B D = B^2\\nBut from earlier, we have B D = B^2 from the t^{-2} coefficient, which gave us a^2 -1 = 2a, which is satisfied.\\nNow B C = P^2\\nB=2a, C= a^2 + 2a -1, P=1+a^2\\nSo left: 2a (a^2 + 2a -1) = 2a^3 + 4a^2 -2a\\nRight: (1+a^2)^2 = 1 + 2a^2 + a^4\\nSet equal: 2a^3 + 4a^2 -2a = a^4 + 2a^2 + 1\\nBring to left: -a^4 + 2a^3 + 2a^2 -2a -1 = 0\\nMultiply by -1: a^4 - 2a^3 - 2a^2 + 2a + 1 = 0\\nNow plug in a=1+√2\\nCompute a^2 = (1+√2)^2 = 1+2√2+2=3+2√2\\na^3 = a^2 * a = (3+2√2)(1+√2) = 3*1 + 3*√2 + 2√2*1 + 2√2*√2 = 3 + 3√2 + 2√2 + 4 = 7 + 5√2\\na^4 = (a^2)^2 = (3+2√2)^2 = 9 + 12√2 + 8 = 17 + 12√2\\nNow a^4 - 2a^3 - 2a^2 + 2a + 1 = (17+12√2) - 2(7+5√2) - 2(3+2√2) + 2(1+√2) + 1 = 17+12√2 -14 -10√2 -6 -4√2 +2 +2√2 +1\\nCombine constants: 17-14-6+2+1 = (17+2+1)+(-14-6)=20-20=0\\n√2 terms: 12 -10 -4 +2 = (12+2)+(-10-4)=14-14=0\\nSimilarly for a=1-√2, it will work by symmetry.\\nSo both a=1+√2 and a=1-√2 satisfy.\\nTherefore, the two lines of symmetry are y = (1+√2)x and y = (1-√2)x.\\nBut the problem asks for two lines, and this seems correct.\\nHowever, often in such problems, they might expect simpler answers, but mathematically this is correct.\\nI recall that for y=x+1/x, sometimes it's said to have symmetry about y=x, but our calculation shows otherwise.\\nGiven the conic section analysis, this must be correct.\\nSo answer for Problem 1: y = (1+√2)x and y = (1-√2)x.\\n\\nProblem 2: Solve the system:\\nx^2 y + y^2 z = 1040  (1)\\nx^2 z + z^2 y = 260   (2)\\n(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) = -540  (3)\\n\\nLet me denote the equations.\\nNotice that (1) and (2) have common terms.\\nLet me try to factor or find relations.\\nLet me consider if x,y,z are in arithmetic progression or something.\\nNotice that (3) involves differences.\\nLet a = x-y, b = y-z, c = z-x, then a+b+c=0, and a b c = -540.\\nBut c = -a-b, so a b (-a-b) = -540 => -a b (a+b) = -540 => a b (a+b) = 540\\nSo we have a b (a+b) = 540.\\nBut not sure.\\nPerhaps assume that x,y,z are close to each other.\\nAnother idea: let me set s = x+y+z, but may not help.\\nNotice that in (1) and (2), both have x^2 terms.\\nLet me subtract or add.\\nLet me consider (1) - k*(2) for some k.\\nOr divide (1) by (2):\\n( x^2 y + y^2 z ) / ( x^2 z + z^2 y ) = 1040 / 260 = 4\\nSo (x^2 y + y^2 z) / (x^2 z + z^2 y) = 4\\nAssume z ≠ 0, and x^2 z + z^2 y ≠ 0, which likely.\\nSo x^2 y + y^2 z = 4 x^2 z + 4 z^2 y\\nBring all to one side:\\nx^2 y + y^2 z - 4 x^2 z - 4 z^2 y = 0\\nFactor:\\nx^2 (y - 4z) + y z (y - 4z) = 0? No.\\nx^2 y - 4 x^2 z + y^2 z - 4 z^2 y = x^2 (y - 4z) + y z (y - 4z) = (x^2 + y z) (y - 4z)\\nIs that right?\\nx^2 (y-4z) + y z (y - 4z) = (x^2 + y z)(y - 4z), yes!\\nSo (x^2 + y z) (y - 4z) = 0\\nTherefore, either x^2 + y z = 0 or y - 4z = 0\\nCase 1: y = 4z\\nCase 2: x^2 + y z = 0\\nNow, also we have the third equation.\\nConsider Case 1: y = 4z\\nSubstitute into (1) and (2).\\n(1): x^2 (4z) + (4z)^2 z = 4 x^2 z + 16 z^3 = 1040\\n(2): x^2 z + z^2 (4z) = x^2 z + 4 z^3 = 260\\nSo we have:\\n4 x^2 z + 16 z^3 = 1040  => divide by 4: x^2 z + 4 z^3 = 260  (1a)\\nAnd (2): x^2 z + 4 z^3 = 260  (2)\\nExactly the same as (1a)!\\nSo both equations reduce to x^2 z + 4 z^3 = 260\\nFactor: z (x^2 + 4 z^2) = 260  (4)\\nNow, we have y=4z, and this.\\nNow the third equation: (x-y)(y-z)(z-x) = -540\\nSubstitute y=4z:\\nx - y = x - 4z\\ny - z = 4z - z = 3z\\nz - x = -(x - z)\\nSo (x-4z)(3z)(- (x - z)) = -540\\nSimplify: -3z (x-4z)(x-z) = -540\\nSo 3z (x-4z)(x-z) = 540\\nDivide by 3: z (x-4z)(x-z) = 180  (5)\\nNow, let me set u = x/z, assuming z≠0.\\nFrom (4): z ( (x/z)^2 z^2 + 4 z^2 ) = z ( u^2 z^2 + 4 z^2 ) = z^3 (u^2 + 4) = 260  (4a)\\nFrom (5): z (x-4z)(x-z) = z * z(u - 4) * z(u - 1) = z^3 (u-4)(u-1) = 180  (5a)\\nNow, let w = z^3\\nThen (4a): w (u^2 + 4) = 260\\n(5a): w (u-4)(u-1) = 180\\nNow, divide the two equations:\\n[ w (u^2 + 4) ] / [ w (u-4)(u-1) ] = 260 / 180 = 13/9\\nSo (u^2 + 4) / [(u-4)(u-1)] = 13/9\\nNote that (u-4)(u-1) = u^2 -5u +4\\nSo (u^2 + 4) / (u^2 -5u +4) = 13/9\\nCross-multiply:\\n9(u^2 + 4) = 13(u^2 -5u +4)\\n9u^2 + 36 = 13u^2 -65u + 52\\nBring to left:\\n9u^2 + 36 -13u^2 +65u -52 = 0\\n-4u^2 +65u -16 = 0\\nMultiply by -1: 4u^2 -65u +16 = 0\\nDiscriminant d = 4225 - 256 = 3969 = 63^2\\nSo u = [65 ± 63] / 8\\nu = (65+63)/8 = 128/8 = 16\\nu = (65-63)/8 = 2/8 = 0.25\\nNow, for each u, find w from one equation.\\nFirst, u=16\\nFrom (5a): w (16-4)(16-1) = w * 12 * 15 = 180w = 180? Wait, w * 180 = 180, so w=1\\nFrom (4a): w(u^2+4)=1*(256+4)=260, yes.\\nw=z^3=1, so z=1 (real numbers)\\nThen y=4z=4\\nx=u z=16*1=16\\nNow check the third equation: (x-y)(y-z)(z-x)=(16-4)(4-1)(1-16)=12*3*(-15)=36*(-15)=-540, yes.\\nNow second, u=0.25=1/4\\nFrom (5a): w (u-4)(u-1) = w (1/4 -4)(1/4 -1) = w (-15/4)(-3/4) = w * 45/16 = 180\\nSo w = 180 * 16 / 45 = (180/45)*16 = 4*16=64\\nSo z^3=64, z=4\\ny=4z=16\\nx=u z=(1/4)*4=1\\nNow check (1): x^2 y + y^2 z = 1^2 *16 + 16^2 *4 = 16 + 256*4 = 16 + 1024=1040, good.\\n(2): x^2 z + z^2 y = 1*4 + 16*16 = 4 + 256=260, good.\\n(3): (x-y)(y-z)(z-x)=(1-16)(16-4)(4-1)=(-15)(12)(3)= -540, good.\\nNow, what if z=0?\\nIf z=0, from (2): x^2 *0 + 0^2 * y =0=260? Contradiction.\\nSo z≠0.\\nNow, Case 2: x^2 + y z = 0\\nFrom earlier, when we had (x^2 + y z)(y-4z)=0, so if x^2 + y z =0, then y-4z may not be zero.\\nSo x^2 = - y z\\nNow plug into (1) and (2).\\n(1): x^2 y + y^2 z = (-y z) y + y^2 z = -y^2 z + y^2 z =0, but should be 1040, contradiction.\\nSo impossible.\\nTherefore, only solutions are from case 1.\\nSo triplets: (16,4,1) and (1,16,4)\\nBut are there more?\\nIn the triplets, we have (x,y,z) = (16,4,1) and (1,16,4)\\nNow, is that all?\\nBut let me see if there are other cases.\\nEarlier we assumed z≠0, which is fine.\\nAlso, in the division, we assumed x^2 z + z^2 y ≠0, but in our solutions, for (16,4,1): x^2 z + z^2 y = 256*1 + 1*4=256+4=260≠0\\nFor (1,16,4): 1*4 + 16*16=4+256=260≠0, good.\\nNow, could there be solutions where x^2 z + z^2 y =0? But in that case, from (2), 0=260, contradiction, so no.\\nSimilarly, if denominator was zero, but it's not possible.\\nSo only two solutions.\\nBut the problem asks for triplets of real numbers, and we have two.\\nNow, list them: (16,4,1) and (1,16,4)\\nBut is (4,1,16) a solution? Probably not, but let's see if there are more.\\nNotice that in the two solutions, it's like cycling, but let's check.\\nIn first solution: x=16,y=4,z=1\\nSecond: x=1,y=16,z=4\\nNow, if I try x=4,y=1,z=16\\nThen (1): x^2 y + y^2 z = 16*1 + 1*16=16+16=32≠1040\\nNo.\\nOther permutations.\\nBut we have only these two from the cases.\\nIn case 1, we got two solutions.\\nBut is there a symmetric solution?\\nNotice that the system is not symmetric in x,y,z.\\nFor example, in (1) and (2), x appears squared, while y and z are mixed.\\nSo probably only these two.\\nBut let me confirm the third equation for both.\\nFirst: (16,4,1): (16-4)=12, (4-1)=3, (1-16)=-15, product 12*3*(-15)=36*(-15)=-540, good.\\nSecond: (1,16,4): (1-16)=-15, (16-4)=12, (4-1)=3, product (-15)*12*3=-540, good.\\nNow, are there solutions where y=4z is not assumed, but we had only two cases, and case 2 impossible.\\nBut in case 2, we had x^2 + y z =0, led to (1) being 0, contradiction.\\nSo only case 1, with two subcases.\\nThus the triplets are (16,4,1) and (1,16,4)\\nBut the problem says \"triplets\", so list both.\\nNow, for Problem 1, we have y = (1+√2)x and y = (1-√2)x\\nBut let me write as equations.\\nSo answer 1: y = (1+√2)x and y = (1-√2)x\\nAnswer 2: (16,4,1) and (1,16,4)\\nNow in JSON.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"y=(1+√2)x and y=(1-√2)x\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(16,4,1) and (1,16,4)\"\n}",
