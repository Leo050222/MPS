Each subsequent disk is centered on the circumference of the previous one and has radius (2/3) of the prior. Each disk spins at π/6 radians per second relative to its parent (or ground for the first). Alice sits at the limit point of all these disks — meaning she is effectively located at the end of this infinite chain of rotating arms.\\n\\nLet’s model this as a sum of complex-valued functions, where each disk contributes a rotating vector.\\n\\nLet R₀ = 5, and Rₙ = 5 × (2/3)ⁿ.\\nEach disk rotates at angular speed ω = π/6 rad/s.\\nSince all disks rotate at the same angular speed and start aligned radially outward at t=0, their contributions add up constructively in direction at t=0, but over time they continue rotating.\\n\\nBut here's the key: each disk rotates *relative to the disk it is attached to*. So the motion is cumulative.\\n\\nLet’s define the position of Alice as a function of time:\\n\\nLet z(t) = Σₙ₌₀^∞ Rₙ e^(i n ω t)\\nWait — is that correct?\\n\\nActually, no. Because each disk rotates relative to the previous one, the total angle of the nth arm from the inertial frame is the *sum* of all previous rotation angles.\\n\\nSince each disk spins at angular velocity ω = π/6 relative to its parent, and assuming they all spin in the same direction (say, counterclockwise), then after time t, the orientation of the nth disk's arm relative to the inertial frame is:\\n\\nθₙ(t) = ωt + ωt + ... + ωt (n+1 times?) Wait — let’s index carefully.\\n\\nLet’s say:\\n- Disk 0: center at origin, radius R₀ = 5, rotates at ω relative to ground → angle = ωt\\n- Disk 1: center on circumference of disk 0, radius R₁ = 5*(2/3), rotates at ω relative to disk 0 → so its vector from center of disk 1 to Alice (and beyond) has angle = ωt (relative), so absolute angle = ωt (from disk 0) + ωt = 2ωt\\n- Disk 2: center on circumference of disk 1, radius R₂ = 5*(2/3)², rotates at ω relative to disk 1 → its arm adds another ωt, so absolute angle = 3ωt\\n- ...\\n- The nth disk's contribution to the position vector has angle = (n+1)ωt? Wait — actually, the first disk (n=0) contributes a vector of length R₀ at angle ωt.\\nBut wait — at t=0, all centers are aligned radially outward. So initially, all vectors point in the same direction (say, along the real axis).\\nAs time progresses, each disk spins at ω relative to its base.\\nSo:\\n- The vector from disk 0's center to its edge point (where disk 1 is attached) rotates at ωt.\\n- The vector from disk 1's center to its edge (where disk 2 is attached) rotates at ωt relative to disk 1, so in absolute terms, its angle is (angle of disk 0's rotation) + (rotation of disk 1) = ωt + ωt = 2ωt.\\n- Similarly, disk 2's vector has absolute angle 3ωt, etc.\\nBut Alice is not on a finite disk — she is at the limit point of the infinite chain.\\nSo her position is the infinite sum:\\n\\nz(t) = Σₙ₌₀^∞ Rₙ e^(i (n+1) ω t)\\nWait — for n=0: R₀ e^(i ω t)\\nn=1: R₁ e^(i 2ωt)\\nn=2: R₂ e^(i 3ωt)\\n...\\nSo general term: Rₙ = 5 × (2/3)ⁿ\\nAngle for nth term: (n+1)ωt? No — wait, the first term (disk 0) is at angle ωt → coefficient 1×ωt\\nSecond term (disk 1): 2ωt\\nnth term: (n+1)ωt? But index n starts at 0.\\nActually, better to reindex.\\nLet k = n+1? Or just write:\\n\\nz(t) = Σₖ₌₁^∞ R_{k−1} e^(i k ω t)\\nBut R_{k−1} = 5 × (2/3)^{k−1}\\nSo z(t) = 5 Σₖ₌₁^∞ (2/3)^{k−1} e^(i k ω t)\\n= 5 e^(i ω t) Σₖ₌₁^∞ (2/3)^{k−1} e^(i (k−1) ω t)\\n= 5 e^(i ω t) Σₘ₌₀^∞ [ (2/3) e^(i ω t) ]^m\\nThis is a geometric series!\\nLet r = (2/3) e^(i ω t)\\nThen sum from m=0 to ∞ of r^m = 1 / (1 − r), provided |r| < 1. Since |r| = 2/3 < 1, converges.\\nSo z(t) = 5 e^(i ω t) × 1 / (1 − (2/3) e^(i ω t))\\nSimplify:\\nz(t) = 5 e^(i ω t) / (1 − (2/3) e^(i ω t))\\n\\nNow, we are to find the length of the trajectory that Alice traces out from t=0 to t=12 seconds.\\nThat is, the arc length of the curve z(t) for t ∈ [0,12].\\nArc length L = ∫₀¹² |z′(t)| dt\\nSo we need to compute |dz/dt| and integrate from 0 to 12.\\n\\nLet ω = π/6.\\nLet u = e^(i ω t) → du/dt = i ω e^(i ω t) = i ω u\\nThen z(t) = 5 u / (1 − (2/3) u)\\nCompute dz/dt = dz/du × du/dt\\nFirst, dz/du = d/du [5u / (1 − (2/3)u)]\\n= 5 [ (1 − (2/3)u) − u (−2/3) ] / (1 − (2/3)u)^2\\n= 5 [1 − (2/3)u + (2/3)u] / (1 − (2/3)u)^2\\n= 5 [1] / (1 − (2/3)u)^2\\n= 5 / (1 − (2/3)u)^2\\nThen dz/dt = dz/du × du/dt = [5 / (1 − (2/3)u)^2] × (i ω u)\\nSo dz/dt = 5 i ω u / (1 − (2/3)u)^2\\nNow |dz/dt| = |5 i ω u| / |1 − (2/3)u|^2\\n|i| = 1, |u| = |e^(iωt)| = 1, so |5 i ω u| = 5 ω\\nDenominator: |1 − (2/3)u|^2\\nSo |dz/dt| = 5 ω / |1 − (2/3) e^(i ω t)|^2\\nNow compute |1 − (2/3) e^(iθ)|^2 where θ = ωt\\n|1 − r e^(iθ)|^2 = (1 − r cosθ)^2 + (r sinθ)^2 = 1 − 2r cosθ + r² cos²θ + r² sin²θ = 1 − 2r cosθ + r²\\nHere r = 2/3\\nSo |1 − (2/3)e^(iθ)|^2 = 1 − 2*(2/3) cosθ + (4/9) = 1 − (4/3) cosθ + 4/9 = (13/9) − (4/3) cosθ\\nThus |dz/dt| = 5 ω / [ (13/9) − (4/3) cos(ωt) ]\\nω = π/6\\nSo |dz/dt| = 5*(π/6) / [13/9 − 4/3 cos(ωt)]\\nSimplify numerator: 5π/6\\nDenominator: 13/9 − 4/3 cos(ωt) = (13 − 12 cos(ωt))/9\\nSo |dz/dt| = (5π/6) / [(13 − 12 cos(ωt))/9] = (5π/6) * (9)/(13 − 12 cos(ωt)) = (45π)/(6(13 − 12 cos(ωt))) = (15π)/(2(13 − 12 cos(ωt)))\\nSo L = ∫₀¹² |z′(t)| dt = ∫₀¹² (15π)/(2(13 − 12 cos(ωt))) dt\\nWith ω = π/6\\nMake substitution: let θ = ωt = (π/6)t → dθ = (π/6) dt → dt = (6/π) dθ\\nWhen t=0, θ=0; t=12, θ = (π/6)*12 = 2π\\nSo L = ∫₀^{2π} (15π)/(2(13 − 12 cosθ)) * (6/π) dθ = ∫₀^{2π} (15π * 6) / (2π (13 − 12 cosθ)) dθ = ∫₀^{2π} (90) / (2(13 − 12 cosθ)) dθ = ∫₀^{2π} 45 / (13 − 12 cosθ) dθ\\nNow we need to compute I = ∫₀^{2π} dθ / (a − b cosθ) with a=13, b=12\\nStandard integral: ∫₀^{2π} dθ / (a − b cosθ) = 2π / √(a² − b²) for a > b > 0\\nYes, this is a known result from calculus.\\nHere a=13, b=12, a > b > 0\\n√(a² − b²) = √(169 − 144) = √25 = 5\\nSo ∫₀^{2π} dθ / (13 − 12 cosθ) = 2π / 5\\nTherefore, L = 45 × (2π / 5) = 90π / 5 = 18π\\nSo the length of the trajectory is 18π.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe start with 770. Melody subtracts either 40 or 41 repeatedly until the number is not positive (i.e., ≤ 0), then stops. We want the number of sequences of such moves. Let N be that number. We are told N = a × 2ᵇ with a odd, and asked to compute 100a + b.\\n\\nLet f(n) be the number of sequences starting from n that eventually reach ≤0 by subtracting 40 or 41 each time.\\nWe want f(770).\\nf(n) = 0 if n ≤ 0? But wait — when n ≤ 0, no move is made, so there is exactly one sequence: do nothing. But the problem says: \\\"she performs moves until the number is not positive, and then she stops.\\\"\\nSo the process stops when the number becomes ≤0. So if we start at n ≤ 0, she does zero moves, so one sequence (the empty sequence).\\nBut the initial number is 770 > 0, so she must make at least one move.\\nBut in recurrence, we need base cases.\\nDefine f(n) = number of sequences of moves (each move −40 or −41) starting from n, continuing until the number is ≤0.\\nAt each step, if current number > 0, she can choose −40 or −41 (if the result is still defined — but even if it goes negative, that's allowed, since she stops when not positive).\\nSo from n > 0, she can always subtract 40 or 41 (since both lead to smaller numbers, and process will eventually stop).\\nAfter subtracting, if the new number ≤0, that branch ends. If >0, continue.\\nSo recurrence:\\nf(n) = 1 if n ≤ 0  ? No — because if n ≤ 0, no moves are made, so one sequence (empty).\\nBut when n > 0, f(n) = f(n−40) + f(n−41)\\nBecause she chooses to subtract 40, leading to state n−40, which has f(n−40) continuations, or subtract 41, leading to f(n−41) continuations.\\nAnd the sequences are extended by that first move.\\nYes.\\nBase case: f(n) = 1 for all n ≤ 0.\\nBecause once you're at or below 0, you stop — only one way: do nothing.\\nNow, we need f(770), with:\\nf(n) = f(n−40) + f(n−41) for n > 0\\nf(n) = 1 for n ≤ 0\\nThis is a linear recurrence.\\nNote that the recurrence depends on values 40 and 41 steps back.\\nSince the step sizes are large, computing f(770) directly may require dynamic programming.\\nBut 770 is not too big.\\nWe can compute f(n) for n from 1 up to 770.\\nBut note: for n ≤ 0, f(n)=1\\nFor n=1 to 40: n−40 ≤ −39 ≤0, n−41 ≤ −40 ≤0, so f(n) = f(n−40) + f(n−41) = 1 + 1 = 2\\nSimilarly, for n=41: f(41) = f(1) + f(0) = 2 + 1 = 3\\nn=42: f(42) = f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 2 = 4\\nn=43: f(3)+f(2)=2+2=4\\n...\\nn=80: f(80)=f(40)+f(39)=2+2=4? Wait f(40)=2, f(39)=2 → 4\\nBut let's see the pattern.\\nDefine f(n) for n ≤ 0: f(n)=1\\nn=1 to 40: f(n)=2\\nn=41: f(0)+f(1)=1+2=3\\nn=42: f(2)+f(1)=2+2=4\\nn=43: f(3)+f(2)=2+2=4\\n...\\nn=80: f(40)+f(39)=2+2=4\\nn=81: f(41)+f(40)=3+2=5\\nn=82: f(42)+f(41)=4+3=7\\nThis seems messy. But notice that the recurrence is linear and homogeneous.\\nAlso, since the offsets are 40 and 41, which are consecutive integers, perhaps the sequence stabilizes or has periodicity modulo something.\\nBut we need exact value.\\nAlternatively, note that every move reduces the number by 40 or 41, so the total reduction is sum of moves.\\nLet k be the number of moves. After k moves, the number is 770 − s, where s is the sum of k numbers each 40 or 41.\\nShe stops when the number becomes ≤0, so the process continues as long as the current number >0.\\nBut the sequence is determined by the choices at each step, and it stops when after a move, the number ≤0.\\nBut the recurrence f(n) = f(n−40) + f(n−41) for n>0, f(n)=1 for n≤0, correctly counts the number of ways to go from n to ≤0 by a sequence of −40/−41 moves, stopping when ≤0.\\nYes.\\nNow, to compute f(770), we can use dynamic programming.\\nBut 770 is manageable.\\nHowever, doing it by hand is tedious. Perhaps there is a pattern.\\nNote that the characteristic equation is x^41 = x + 1? No.\\nThe recurrence is f(n) = f(n−40) + f(n−41)\\nSo characteristic equation: r^41 = r + 1? Let's see.\\nAssume f(n) ≈ r^n, then r^n = r^{n−40} + r^{n−41} → multiply both sides by r^{41−n}: r^{41} = r^{1} + 1 → r^{41} − r − 1 = 0\\nBut this is high degree, not helpful.\\nNotice that for n ≤ 0, f(n)=1\\nn=1 to 40: f(n)=2\\nn=41: f(1)+f(0)=2+1=3\\nn=42: f(2)+f(1)=2+2=4\\nn=43: f(3)+f(2)=2+2=4\\n...\\nn=80: f(40)+f(39)=2+2=4\\nn=81: f(41)+f(40)=3+2=5\\nn=82: f(42)+f(41)=4+3=7\\nn=83: f(43)+f(42)=4+4=8\\nn=84: f(44)+f(43)=4+4=8\\n...\\nn=120: f(80)+f(79)=4+4=8? f(80)=4, f(79): 79>40, f(79)=f(39)+f(38)=2+2=4 → yes, 8\\nn=121: f(81)+f(80)=5+4=9\\nn=122: f(82)+f(81)=7+5=12\\nn=123: f(83)+f(82)=8+7=15\\nn=124: f(84)+f(83)=8+8=16\\n...\\nThis is growing, but slowly.\\nBut we need f(770). Perhaps we can write a small program, but since we must do by hand, look for a pattern or cycle.\\nNote that the recurrence f(n) = f(n−40) + f(n−41) suggests that the sequence is constant on residue classes modulo gcd(40,41)=1, so no help.\\nBut observe that the increment happens in blocks.\\nAnother idea: since the base case is f(n)=1 for n≤0, and f(n)=2 for 1≤n≤40, then for n≥41, it increases.\\nMoreover, f(n) depends on values 40 and 41 steps back, so the state can be captured by a vector of 41 consecutive values.\\nBut still, computing up to 770 requires about 770 steps.\\nNote that 770 = 40×19 + 10, or 41×18 + 32, not sure.\\nBut let's compute f(n) in terms of how many ways to write the path.\\nEach sequence of moves corresponds to a sequence of subtractions of 40 or 41, and the process stops when the cumulative sum exceeds 770.\\nBut it's not that the total sum exceeds 770, but that after some prefix, the remaining number ≤0.\\nSpecifically, a sequence of moves a₁,a₂,...,a_k with a_i=40 or 41, such that after j moves, the number is 770 − s_j >0 for j<k, and 770 − s_k ≤0, where s_j = sum_{i=1}^j a_i.\\nAnd we want the number of such sequences (of any length k≥1).\\nBut the recurrence f(n) = f(n−40) + f(n−41) for n>0, with f(n)=1 for n≤0, actually counts the number of ways to reach ≤0, including the paths that go below 0.\\nAnd since from any n>0, you must make a move, and then continue from n−40 or n−41, and the number of ways from there is f(n−40) or f(n−41), and since the choices are independent, yes, f(n) = f(n−40) + f(n−41) is correct.\\nNow, to compute f(770), we can use the fact that the recurrence is linear, and perhaps compute iteratively.\\nBut let's see if there is a closed form or pattern.\\nNotice that for n ≤ 0, f(n) = 1\\nFor 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, f(n) = 2\\nFor 41 ≤ n ≤ 80, f(n) = f(n−40) + f(n−41)\\nn−40 ranges from 1 to 40, so f(n−40)=2\\nn−41 ranges from 0 to 39\\nf(0)=1, f(1) to f(39)=2\\nSo for n=41: f(1)+f(0)=2+1=3\\nn=42: f(2)+f(1)=2+2=4\\n...\\nn=80: f(40)+f(39)=2+2=4\\nSo for n=41:3, n=42 to 80:4? n=42:4, n=43: f(3)+f(2)=2+2=4, ..., n=80:4\\nOnly n=41 is 3, others 4.\\nNow n=81: f(41)+f(40)=3+2=5\\nn=82: f(42)+f(41)=4+3=7\\nn=83: f(43)+f(42)=4+4=8\\nn=84: f(44)+f(43)=4+4=8\\n...\\nn=120: f(80)+f(79)=4+4=8\\nn=121: f(81)+f(80)=5+4=9\\nn=122: f(82)+f(81)=7+5=12\\nn=123: f(83)+f(82)=8+7=15\\nn=124: f(84)+f(83)=8+8=16\\nn=125: f(85)+f(84)=8+8=16\\n...\\nn=160: f(120)+f(119)=8+8=16? f(119): 119-40=79, f(79)=4; 119-41=78, f(78)=4 → f(119)=4+4=8? Wait no\\nf(119) = f(119-40) + f(119-41) = f(79) + f(78)\\nf(79): 79>40, f(79)=f(39)+f(38)=2+2=4\\nf(78)=f(38)+f(37)=2+2=4\\nSo f(79)=4, f(78)=4, so f(119)=4+4=8\\nSimilarly, f(120)=f(80)+f(79)=4+4=8\\nSo f(160)=f(120)+f(119)=8+8=16\\nf(161)=f(121)+f(120)=9+8=17\\nf(121)=f(81)+f(80)=5+4=9, yes\\nf(162)=f(122)+f(121)=12+9=21\\nf(163)=f(123)+f(122)=15+12=27\\nf(164)=f(124)+f(123)=16+15=31\\nf(165)=f(125)+f(124)=16+16=32\\nf(166)=f(126)+f(125)=16+16=32\\n...\\nf(200)=f(160)+f(159)\\nf(159)=f(119)+f(118)=8+8=16? f(118)=f(78)+f(77)=4+4=8, f(119)=8, so f(159)=8+8=16\\nf(160)=16, so f(200)=16+16=32\\nI see a pattern: at n=40k, f(40k) might be 2^{k+1} or something?\\nf(40)=2 = 2^1\\nf(80)=4 = 2^2\\nf(120)=8 = 2^3\\nf(160)=16 = 2^4\\nf(200)=32 = 2^5\\nOh! So f(40k) = 2^k for k≥1? f(40)=2=2^1, yes; f(80)=4=2^2, yes; f(120)=8=2^3, yes; f(160)=16=2^4, f(200)=32=2^5, so f(40k) = 2^k\\nBut k=1:40, 2^1=2; k=2:80, 4=2^2; so f(40k) = 2^k\\nNow what about f(41k)?\\nf(41)=3, f(82)=7, f(123)=15, f(164)=31, f(205)=?\\nf(41)=3=4-1=2^2 -1\\nf(82)=7=8-1=2^3 -1\\nf(123)=15=16-1=2^4 -1\\nf(164)=31=32-1=2^5 -1\\nSo f(41k) = 2^{k+1} - 1? For k=1: 2^{2}-1=3, yes; k=2:2^3-1=7, yes; k=3:2^4-1=15, yes; k=4:2^5-1=31, yes.\\nSo f(41k) = 2^{k+1} - 1\\nNow our target is f(770)\\n770 div 40 = 19.25, 40*19=760\\n770 - 760 = 10, so 770 = 40*19 + 10\\nSimilarly, 41*18 = 738, 770-738=32\\nNot obvious.\\nBut from the pattern, f(40k) = 2^k\\nSo f(760) = f(40*19) = 2^{19}\\nNow we need f(770) = f(760 + 10)\\nTo compute f(n) for n near 760, we need the recurrence.\\nSince f(n) = f(n-40) + f(n-41), and 770 is large, but we can compute backwards from 760.\\nBut we need values from f(770-40)=f(730) and f(770-41)=f(729)\\nf(730) = f(40*18 + 10) = f(720 + 10)\\nf(720)=f(40*18)=2^{18}\\nSimilarly, f(729)=f(720+9)\\nSo if we can find a pattern for f(40k + r) for fixed r.\\nLet’s define g_k(r) = f(40k + r) for r=0,1,2,...,39\\nFrom earlier:\\nFor k=1: n=40 to 79\\ng_1(0)=f(40)=2\\ng_1(1)=f(41)=3\\ng_1(2)=f(42)=4\\n...\\ng_1(39)=f(79)=4\\nFor k=2: n=80 to 119\\ng_2(0)=f(80)=4\\ng_2(1)=f(81)=5\\ng_2(2)=f(82)=7\\ng_2(3)=f(83)=8\\n...\\ng_2(39)=f(119)=8\\nFor k=3: n=120 to 159\\ng_3(0)=f(120)=8\\ng_3(1)=f(121)=9\\ng_3(2)=f(122)=12\\ng_3(3)=f(123)=15\\ng_3(4)=f(124)=16\\n...\\ng_3(39)=f(159)=16\\nFor k=4: g_4(0)=f(160)=16\\ng_4(1)=f(161)=17\\ng_4(2)=f(162)=21\\ng_4(3)=f(163)=27\\ng_4(4)=f(164)=31\\ng_4(5)=f(165)=32\\n...\\ng_4(39)=f(199)=32\\nNow look at g_k(r):\\nk=1: g1(r) = 2 for r=0, 3 for r=1, 4 for r=2 to 39\\nk=2: g2(0)=4, g2(1)=5, g2(2)=7, g2(3)=8, ..., g2(39)=8\\nk=3: g3(0)=8, g3(1)=9, g3(2)=12, g3(3)=15, g3(4)=16, ..., g3(39)=16\\nk=4: g4(0)=16, g4(1)=17, g4(2)=21, g4(3)=27, g4(4)=31, g4(5)=32, ..., g4(39)=32\\nNotice that g_k(0) = 2^k\\ng_k(1) = 2^k + 1\\nk=1: 2+1=3? g1(1)=3, 2^1 +1=3, yes\\nk=2:4+1=5, yes\\nk=3:8+1=9, yes\\nk=4:16+1=17, yes\\ng_k(2): k=1:4, k=2:7, k=3:12, k=4:21\\n4,7,12,21 — differences: 3,5,9 — not arithmetic. 4=4,7=7,12=12,21=21\\n4=2^2, 7=7, 12=12, 21=21\\nNote 4=2^2, but k=1:4=2^{2}, k=2:7=2^3 -1, not consistent.\\nFrom recurrence: g_k(r) = f(40k + r) = f(40k + r -40) + f(40k + r -41) = f(40(k-1) + r) + f(40(k-1) + r -1) = g_{k-1}(r) + g_{k-1}(r-1)\\nFor r ≥1, and for r=0: g_k(0) = f(40k) = f(40k -40) + f(40k -41) = f(40(k-1)) + f(40(k-1) -1) = g_{k-1}(0) + g_{k-1}(-1)\\nBut r=-1 is not in 0..39.\\nf(40(k-1) -1) = f(40k -41)\\nNow 40k -41 = 40(k-1) -1, which is less than 40(k-1), so it's in the previous block.\\nSpecifically, for m = 40(k-1) -1 = 40k -41\\nThis is equal to 40(k-1) + 39, since -1 mod 40 is 39, but numerically, 40(k-1) -1 = 40(k-1) -1, which is not of the form 40m + r with r<40 unless we adjust.\\n40(k-1) -1 = 40(k-2) + 40 -1 = 40(k-2) + 39\\nSo f(40k -41) = f(40(k-2) + 39) = g_{k-2}(39)\\nSimilarly, f(40k -40) = f(40(k-1)) = g_{k-1}(0)\\nSo for k≥2, g_k(0) = g_{k-1}(0) + g_{k-2}(39)\\nNow from earlier computations:\\ng1(39)=f(79)=4\\ng2(39)=f(119)=8\\ng3(39)=f(159)=16\\ng4(39)=f(199)=32\\nSo g_k(39) = 2^k ? k=1:4=2^2? 2^2=4, but k=1; k=2:8=2^3; k=3:16=2^4; k=4:32=2^5\\nSo g_k(39) = 2^{k+1}\\nSimilarly, g_k(0) = 2^k\\nNow check the recurrence for g_k(0): g_k(0) = g_{k-1}(0) + g_{k-2}(39)\\nRight-hand side: 2^{k-1} + 2^{(k-2)+1} = 2^{k-1} + 2^{k-1} = 2 * 2^{k-1} = 2^k = left-hand side. Good.\\nNow for r≥1, g_k(r) = g_{k-1}(r) + g_{k-1}(r-1)\\nThis is like Pascal's triangle!\\nSpecifically, g_k(r) = g_{k-1}(r) + g_{k-1}(r-1)\\nWith initial conditions for k=1:\\ng1(r) = 2 for r=0\\n3 for r=1\\n4 for r=2,3,...,39\\nWe can compute g_k(r) recursively.\\nNotice that for each k, g_k(r) seems to be constant for r from some point to 39.\\nFrom earlier:\\nk=1: r=2 to 39: g1(r)=4\\nk=2: r=3 to 39: g2(r)=8? Earlier g2(3)=f(83)=8, g2(4)=f(84)=8, ..., g2(39)=8\\nk=3: r=4 to 39: g3(r)=16? g3(4)=16, g3(5)=f(125)=16, ..., g3(39)=16\\nk=4: r=5 to 39: g4(r)=32? g4(5)=32, ..., g4(39)=32\\nSo it appears that for each k, g_k(r) = 2^{k+1} for r ≥ k+1? \\nFor k=1: r≥2, g1(r)=4=2^2, and k+1=2, yes\\nk=2: r≥3, g2(r)=8=2^3, k+1=3, yes\\nk=3: r≥4, g3(r)=16=2^4, k+1=4, yes\\nk=4: r≥5, g4(r)=32=2^5, k+1=5, yes\\nSo conjecture: for k ≥1, and r ≥ k+1, g_k(r) = 2^{k+1}\\nAnd for r ≤ k, it varies.\\nNow we also have g_k(0) = 2^k\\ng_k(1) = 2^k + 1\\ng_k(2): from recurrence g_k(2) = g_{k-1}(2) + g_{k-1}(1)\\nWe know g1(2)=4, g1(1)=3\\ng2(2)=g1(2)+g1(1)=4+3=7\\ng3(2)=g2(2)+g2(1)=7+5=12\\ng4(2)=g3(2)+g3(1)=12+9=21\\ng5(2)=g4(2)+g4(1)=21+17=38\\nBut according to the constant part, for r≥k+1, g_k(r)=2^{k+1}\\nNow for our problem, we need f(770) = g_{19}(10) since 770 = 40*19 + 10, so k=19, r=10\\nNow r=10, k=19, is r ≥ k+1? 10 ≥ 20? No, 10<20, so not in the constant region.\\nSo we need to compute g_{19}(10)\\nUsing the recurrence g_k(r) = g_{k-1}(r) + g_{k-1}(r-1) for r≥1, and for r=0 we have a different recurrence, but since r=10≥1, we can use this.\\nThis recurrence is similar to binomial coefficients.\\nIn fact, g_k(r) = g_{k-1}(r) + g_{k-1}(r-1)\\nThis is the same as the recurrence for combinations: C(n,k) = C(n-1,k) + C(n-1,k-1)\\nBut here indices are different.\\nSet h(k,r) = g_k(r)\\nh(k,r) = h(k-1,r) + h(k-1,r-1)\\nWith boundary conditions.\\nThis is like a grid.\\nInitial at k=1:\\nh(1,r) = 2 if r=0\\n3 if r=1\\n4 if r=2,3,...,39\\nBut since for r>k+1, h(k,r)=2^{k+1}, and we are interested in r=10, k=19, and 10 < 19+1=20, but 10 is fixed, k increases, so for k large, r=10 < k+1, so not constant.\\nWe can compute h(k,10) for k from 1 up.\\nBut we need k=19.\\nNote that the recurrence h(k,r) = h(k-1,r) + h(k-1,r-1) suggests that h(k,r) can be expressed in terms of h(1,s) for s≤r.\\nSpecifically, it's a linear combination.\\nIn fact, this recurrence is the same as the number of paths in a grid, and h(k,r) = Σ_{i=0}^r c_i h(1,i) for some coefficients.\\nSince it's a linear recurrence, we can think of it as a convolution.\\nNote that h(k,r) = Σ_{j=0}^r \\binom{k-1}{r-j} h(1,j) ? Let's check for small k.\\nFor example, k=2, r=0: h(2,0) = g2(0)=4\\nAccording to formula, Σ_{j=0}^0 \\binom{1}{0-j} h(1,j) — but \\binom{1}{0}=1, j=0, so 1*h(1,0)=2, but should be 4, no.\\nPerhaps h(k,r) = Σ_{j} \\binom{k-1}{r-j} a_j\\nThe general solution for such a recurrence with fixed boundary is that h(k,r) is the sum over j of \\binom{k-1}{r-j} times the initial value at level 1, but only if the recurrence holds for all r, but here r is bounded.\\nSince for r > k+1, h(k,r) = 2^{k+1}, and for r ≤ k+1, it may depend, but in our case for r=10, and k=19>10, we can compute recursively.\\nMoreover, for a fixed r, as k increases, h(k,r) can be computed from h(k-1,r) and h(k-1,r-1), and since r-1 < r, we can compute row by row.\\nWe need h(k,10) for k=19.\\nStart from k=1:\\nh(1,10) = 4 (since r=10≥2)\\nNow for k=2: h(2,10) = h(1,10) + h(1,9) = 4 + 4 = 8\\nk=3: h(3,10) = h(2,10) + h(2,9)\\nh(2,9): since for k=2, r=9≥3? k+1=3, r=9≥3, so h(2,9)=2^{3}=8\\nh(2,10)=8, so h(3,10)=8+8=16\\nk=4: h(4,10) = h(3,10) + h(3,9)\\nh(3,9): k=3, r=9≥4? yes, so 2^{4}=16\\nh(3,10)=16, so h(4,10)=16+16=32\\nk=5: h(5,10) = h(4,10) + h(4,9)\\nh(4,9): k=4, r=9≥5? yes, so 2^5=32\\nh(4,10)=32, so h(5,10)=32+32=64\\nI see a pattern: for k≥2, h(k,10) = 2^{k+1} ?\\nk=2:8=2^3, k+1=3, yes\\nk=3:16=2^4, k+1=4, yes\\nk=4:32=2^5, k+1=5, yes\\nk=5:64=2^6, k+1=6, yes\\nBut k=1: h(1,10)=4=2^2, k+1=2, yes! So for k≥1, h(k,10) = 2^{k+1}\\nIs that possible?\\nCheck for k=6: h(6,10) = h(5,10) + h(5,9)\\nh(5,9): k=5, r=9≥6? 9≥6, yes, so h(5,9)=2^{6}=64\\nh(5,10)=64, so h(6,10)=64+64=128=2^7=2^{6+1}, yes\\nSimilarly, always: since for r=10, and k≥1, when we compute h(k,10) = h(k-1,10) + h(k-1,9)\\nNow for k-1 ≥10, h(k-1,9) = 2^{(k-1)+1} = 2^k, since r=9 ≥ (k-1)+1 = k? When k-1 ≥10, i.e., k≥11, then r=9 ≥ k? 9≥k? Only if k≤9, contradiction.\\nFor h(k-1,9), it is equal to 2^{(k-1)+1} = 2^k only if 9 ≥ (k-1)+1 = k, i.e., k≤9\\nBut for k>9, 9 < k, so r=9 < k, so not in the constant region, so we cannot assume it's 2^k.\\nBut in our calculation above, for k=5, h(5,9): k=5, r=9, k+1=6, 9≥6, yes, so h(5,9)=2^6=64\\nk=6: h(6,9): k=6, r=9≥7? 9≥7, yes, so 2^7=128\\nBut for larger k, say k=10: h(10,9): k=10, r=9, k+1=11, 9≥11? No, 9<11, so not in constant region.\\nSo for k=10, h(10,9) is not necessarily 2^{11}\\nBut in our recurrence for h(k,10), we have h(k,10) = h(k-1,10) + h(k-1,9)\\nAnd if k-1 >10, then r=10 < (k-1)+1 = k, so h(k-1,10) may not be 2^k\\nBut earlier for k=1 to 6, it was 2^{k+1}, but let's compute further.\\nWe have h(1,10)=4\\nh(2,10)=h(1,10)+h(1,9)=4+4=8\\nh(3,10)=h(2,10)+h(2,9)=8+8=16 (since h(2,9)=8 as r=9≥3)\\nh(4,10)=h(3,10)+h(3,9)=16+16=32 (h(3,9)=16 as r=9≥4)\\nh(5,10)=32+32=64 (h(4,9)=32? h(4,9): k=4,r=9≥5? 9≥5, yes, 2^5=32)\\nh(6,10)=h(5,10)+h(5,9)=64 + h(5,9)\\nh(5,9): k=5,r=9≥6? 9≥6, yes, so 2^6=64, so 64+64=128\\nh(7,10)=h(6,10)+h(6,9)=128 + h(6,9)\\nh(6,9): k=6,r=9≥7? 9≥7, yes, 2^7=128, so 128+128=256\\nh(8,10)=h(7,10)+h(7,9)=256 + h(7,9)\\nh(7,9): k=7,r=9≥8? 9≥8, yes, 2^8=256, so 256+256=512\\nh(9,10)=h(8,10)+h(8,9)=512 + h(8,9)\\nh(8,9): k=8,r=9≥9? 9≥9, yes, 2^9=512, so 512+512=1024\\nh(10,10)=h(9,10)+h(9,9)=1024 + h(9,9)\\nh(9,9): k=9,r=9≥10? 9≥10? No, so not in constant region. Need to compute h(9,9)\\nSimilarly, h(10,10) depends on h(9,9), which we don't have.\\nSo far, for k=1 to 9, h(k,10) = 2^{k+1}\\nBut at k=10, we need h(9,9)\\nSo compute h(9,9)\\nTo compute h(9,9), we need the recurrence.\\nh(9,9) = h(8,9) + h(8,8)\\nWe have h(8,9): k=8,r=9≥9? yes, so h(8,9)=2^9=512\\nh(8,8): k=8,r=8≥9? 8≥9? No, so not constant. Need h(8,8)\\nh(8,8) = h(7,8) + h(7,7)\\nh(7,8): k=7,r=8≥8? 8≥8, yes, so h(7,8)=2^8=256\\nh(7,7): k=7,r=7≥8? 7≥8? No, so compute h(7,7)\\nh(7,7) = h(6,7) + h(6,6)\\nh(6,7): k=6,r=7≥7? 7≥7, yes, h(6,7)=2^7=128\\nh(6,6): k=6,r=6≥7? 6≥7? No, compute h(6,6)\\nh(6,6) = h(5,6) + h(5,5)\\nh(5,6): k=5,r=6≥6? 6≥6, yes, h(5,6)=2^6=64\\nh(5,5): k=5,r=5≥6? 5≥6? No, compute h(5,5)\\nh(5,5) = h(4,5) + h(4,4)\\nh(4,5): k=4,r=5≥5? 5≥5, yes, h(4,5)=2^5=32\\nh(4,4): k=4,r=4≥5? 4≥5? No, compute h(4,4)\\nh(4,4) = h(3,4) + h(3,3)\\nh(3,4): k=3,r=4≥4? 4≥4, yes, h(3,4)=2^4=16\\nh(3,3): k=3,r=3≥4? 3≥4? No, compute h(3,3)\\nh(3,3) = h(2,3) + h(2,2)\\nh(2,3): k=2,r=3≥3? 3≥3, yes, h(2,3)=2^3=8\\nh(2,2): k=2,r=2≥3? 2≥3? No, compute h(2,2)\\nh(2,2) = h(1,2) + h(1,1) = 4 + 3 = 7\\nSo h(3,3) = h(2,3) + h(2,2) = 8 + 7 = 15\\nh(4,4) = h(3,4) + h(3,3) = 16 + 15 = 31\\nh(5,5) = h(4,5) + h(4,4) = 32 + 31 = 63\\nh(6,6) = h(5,6) + h(5,5) = 64 + 63 = 127\\nh(7,7) = h(6,7) + h(6,6) = 128 + 127 = 255\\nh(8,8) = h(7,8) + h(7,7) = 256 + 255 = 511\\nh(9,9) = h(8,9) + h(8,8) = 512 + 511 = 1023\\nNow back to h(10,10) = h(9,10) + h(9,9)\\nh(9,10): earlier we had for k=9, r=10≥10? 10≥10, yes, so h(9,10)=2^{10}=1024\\nh(9,9)=1023, so h(10,10)=1024 + 1023 = 2047\\nNow continue to h(11,10) = h(10,10) + h(10,9)\\nh(10,9): k=10,r=9≥11? 9≥11?

No, compute h(3,2)\\nh(3,2) = h(2,2) + h(2,1) = 7 + 5 = 12? h(2,1)=g2(1)=f(81)=5, yes\\nh(3,3)=15, so h(4,3)=15+12=27\\nh(5,4)=h(4,4)+h(4,3)=31+27=58\\nh(6,5)=h(5,5)+h(5,4)=63+58=121\\nh(7,6)=h(6,6)+h(6,5)=127+121=248\\nh(8,7)=h(7,7)+h(7,6)=255+248=503\\nh(9,8)=h(8,8)+h(8,7)=511+503=1014\\nNow h(10,9)=h(9,9)+h(9,8)=1023+1014=2037\\nThen h(11,10)=h(10,10)+h(10,9)=2047+2037=4084\\nThis is getting large, and we need k=19, r=10.\\nBut notice that for k ≤ 10, when r=10, and k ≤ 10, r=10 ≥ k+1 only if 10 ≥ k+1, i.e., k ≤ 9\\nFor k=10, r=10, k+1=11, 10<11, so not constant.\\nBut for k > 10, r=10 < k+1, so not constant, and we have to compute.\\nHowever, recall that for r ≥ k+1, g_k(r) = 2^{k+1}, but for r < k+1, it's different.\\nBut in our case for f(770) = g_19(10), k=19, r=10, and 10 < 19+1=20, so not in constant region.\\nBut perhaps for fixed r, when k is large, but we can see that the recurrence g_k(r) = g_{k-1}(r) + g_{k-1}(r-1) is the same as the binomial coefficient recurrence.\\nIn fact, if the initial condition were constant, it would be binomial, but here it's not.\\nNotice that the recurrence g_k(r) = g_{k-1}(r) + g_{k-1}(r-1) for r≥1, and this is valid as long as r-1 ≥0, which it is for r≥1.\\nThis is exactly the recurrence for the binomial coefficients, where g_k(r) = \\binom{k}{r} times something, but with boundary conditions.\\nConsider that g_k(r) might be close to 2^{k+1} for r around k/2, but here r=10 fixed, k=19 large.\\nAnother observation: since the recurrence is linear, and for r > k+1, it's 2^{k+1}, and for r ≤ k+1, it's determined by the values at k=1.\\nBut perhaps we can compute g_k(10) for k=19 using the fact that it satisfies the recurrence and we can use generating functions, but it's complicated.\\nRecall that at k=1, g1(r) = 2 for r=0, 3 for r=1, 4 for r=2 to 39\\nFor r≥2, it's 4.\\nNow the recurrence g_k(r) = g_{k-1}(r) + g_{k-1}(r-1)\\nThis is the same as the number of ways to reach (k,r) from (1,s) with steps that increase k by 1 and r by 0 or 1? Not quite.\\nThink of it as a path in the k-r plane.\\nFrom (k-1,r) to (k,r), or from (k-1,r-1) to (k,r), so it's like moving right and up-right.\\nSo the value at (k,r) is sum over paths from the initial line k=1 to (k,r) of the initial values times the number of paths, but since it's linear, g_k(r) = Σ_{j=0}^{39} c_{k,r,j} g1(j)\\nAnd the coefficient c_{k,r,j} is the number of paths from (1,j) to (k,r) with steps (1,0) and (1,1)? From (k-1,s) to (k,s) or (k,s+1)? Let's see.\\nFrom the recurrence, to reach (k,r), it comes from (k-1,r) or (k-1,r-1)\\nSo the step is from (k-1, s) to (k, s) or (k, s+1)? If from (k-1,r) to (k,r), that's (1,0) in (k,r) coordinates.\\nFrom (k-1,r-1) to (k,r), that's (1,1)\\nSo each step increases k by 1, and r by 0 or 1.\\nSo from (1,j) to (k,r), the number of steps is k-1, and the increase in r is r - j.\\nSince each step increases r by 0 or 1, the number of (1,1) steps is r - j, and number of (1,0) steps is (k-1) - (r - j) = k-1 -r +j\\nThis must be non-negative, so r - j ≥0 and k-1 -r +j ≥0, i.e., j ≤ r and j ≥ r - (k-1)\\nAlso j between 0 and 39.\\nThe number of such paths is \\binom{k-1}{r-j} , since choose which of the k-1 steps are the (1,1) steps, the rest are (1,0).\\nNumber of (1,1) steps is r - j, so \\binom{k-1}{r-j}\\nYes.\\nSo g_k(r) = Σ_{j=\\max(0, r-k+1)}^{\\min(39,r)} \\binom{k-1}{r-j} g1(j)\\nNow for our case, k=19, r=10\\nSo g_{19}(10) = Σ_{j=\\max(0,10-19+1)}^{\\min(39,10)} \\binom{18}{10-j} g1(j) = Σ_{j=\\max(0,-8)}^{10} \\binom{18}{10-j} g1(j) = Σ_{j=0}^{10} \\binom{18}{10-j} g1(j)\\nNow g1(j) = 2 if j=0, 3 if j=1, 4 if j=2,3,...,10 (since 10≤39)\\nSo split the sum:\\nj=0: \\binom{18}{10-0} * 2 = \\binom{18}{10} * 2\\nj=1: \\binom{18}{9} * 3\\nj=2 to 10: \\binom{18}{10-j} * 4\\nLet m = 10 - j, then when j=2, m=8; j=10, m=0\\nSo sum_{j=2}^{10} \\binom{18}{10-j} * 4 = 4 * sum_{m=0}^{8} \\binom{18}{m}\\nBecause j=2 to 10, m=8 down to 0, so m=0 to 8\\nYes.\\nSo g_{19}(10) = 2 \\binom{18}{10} + 3 \\binom{18}{9} + 4 \\sum_{m=0}^{8} \\binom{18}{m}\\nNote that \\binom{18}{10} = \\binom{18}{8}, \\binom{18}{9} = \\binom{18}{9}\\nAnd sum_{m=0}^{8} \\binom{18}{m} = sum_{m=0}^{8} \\binom{18}{m}\\nBy symmetry, \\binom{18}{m} = \\binom{18}{18-m}, and sum_{m=0}^{18} \\binom{18}{m} = 2^{18}\\n sum_{m=0}^{8} \\binom{18}{m} + \\binom{18}{9} + sum_{m=10}^{18} \\binom{18}{m} = 2^{18}\\nBut sum_{m=10}^{18} \\binom{18}{m} = sum_{k=0}^{8} \\binom{18}{k} where k=18-m, when m=10,k=8; m=18,k=0, so sum_{k=0}^{8} \\binom{18}{k} = sum_{m=0}^{8} \\binom{18}{m}\\nSo let S = sum_{m=0}^{8} \\binom{18}{m}\\nThen 2S + \\binom{18}{9} = 2^{18}\\nSo S = (2^{18} - \\binom{18}{9}) / 2\\nNow compute the values.\\nFirst, \\binom{18}{9} = 48620 (standard value)\\n2^{18} = 262144\\nSo S = (262144 - 48620) / 2 = 213524 / 2 = 106762\\nNow \\binom{18}{10} = \\binom{18}{8} = \\binom{18}{8}\\n\\binom{18}{8} = \\binom{17}{7} + \\binom{17}{8}\\nOr known value: \\binom{18}{8} = 43758\\n\\binom{18}{9} = 48620\\n\\binom{18}{10} = \\binom{18}{8} = 43758\\nNow plug in:\\ng_{19}(10) = 2 * \\binom{18}{10} + 3 * \\binom{18}{9} + 4 * S = 2*43758 + 3*48620 + 4*106762\\nCompute each:\\n2*43758 = 87516\\n3*48620 = 145860\\n4*106762 = 427048\\nSum: 87516 + 145860 = 233376\\n233376 + 427048 = 660424\\nSo f(770) = 660424\\nNow we need to write N = 660424 = a * 2^b with a odd.\\nFactor out powers of 2.\\n660424 ÷ 2 = 330212\\n÷2=165106\\n÷2=82553\\n82553 is odd.\\nSo divided by 2^3, so b=3, a=82553\\nNow verify: 82553 * 8 = 82553 * 8\\n80000*8=640000, 2553*8=20424, total 640000+20424=660424, yes.\\nAnd a=82553 is odd.\\nSo a=82553, b=3\\nThen 100a + b = 100*82553 + 3 = 8,255,300 + 3 = 8,255,303\\n\\nBut is this correct? Let me double-check the sum.\\nS = sum_{m=0}^8 \\binom{18}{m} = (2^{18} - \\binom{18}{9}) / 2 = (262144 - 48620)/2 = 213524/2 = 106762, ok.\\n\\binom{18}{10} = \\binom{18}{8} = let's confirm: \\binom{18}{8} = 18!/(8!10!) = (18×17×16×15×14×13×12×11)/(8×7×6×5×4×3×2×1) = calculate step by step:\\n18/6=3, so (3×17×16×15×14×13×12×11)/(8×7×5×4×3×2×1) better:\\nNumerator: 18×17=306, ×16=4896, ×15=73440, ×14=1,028,160, ×13=13,365,680, ×12=160,388,160, ×11=1,764,269,760\\nDenominator 8! = 40320\\n1,764,269,760 / 40320\\nFirst, 40320 × 43758 = ?
