No, that would give sum $\\\\le \\\\sum \\\\frac{x}{9} = \\\\frac{4}{9}$, which is exactly what we want!\\n\\nWait! Suppose we can show:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{x}{x^3 + 8} \\\\le \\\\frac{x}{9} \\\\quad \\\\text{for all } x \\\\ge 0\\n$$\\nThen summing gives $\\\\sum \\\\frac{a}{a^3+8} \\\\le \\\\sum \\\\frac{a}{9} = \\\\frac{a+b+c+d}{9} = \\\\frac{4}{9}$, which proves the inequality.\\n\\nBut is $\\\\frac{x}{x^3 + 8} \\\\le \\\\frac{x}{9}$?\\n\\nFor $x = 0$: both sides 0 → OK.\\nFor $x > 0$, divide both sides by $x$: is $\\\\frac{1}{x^3 + 8} \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{9}$?\\nWhich means: $x^3 + 8 \\\\ge 9 \\\\Rightarrow x^3 \\\\ge 1 \\\\Rightarrow x \\\\ge 1$.\\n\\nBut this fails when $x < 1$. For example, $x = 0$: $\\\\frac{1}{8} > \\\\frac{1}{9}$, so $\\\\frac{1}{x^3+8} > \\\\frac{1}{9}$ when $x < 1$, so inequality goes the wrong way.\\n\\nSo $\\\\frac{x}{x^3+8} > \\\\frac{x}{9}$ when $x < 1$. So that approach fails.\\n\\nAlternative idea: Use the inequality $\\\\frac{x}{x^3 + 8} \\\\le \\\\frac{4}{27}x + c$ or some linear upper bound.\\n\\nBut perhaps better: Try to prove that $\\\\frac{x}{x^3 + 8} \\\\le \\\\frac{4}{9} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{x + something}{something}$ — no.\\n\\nAnother idea: Since the function is not concave everywhere, but maybe we can use the Tangent Line Method or convexity in certain intervals.\\n\\nWait: Try equality case. When does equality hold?\\nSuppose $a = b = c = d = 1$. Then each term: $\\\\frac{1}{1 + 8} = \\\\frac{1}{9}$, so sum = $4 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{9} = \\\\frac{4}{9}$. So equality holds at $a=b=c=d=1$.\\n\\nSo the maximum is achieved when all variables are 1.\\n\\nNow, since the function $f(x) = \\\\frac{x}{x^3+8}$ may be concave around $x=1$, maybe we can use Jensen’s inequality if $f$ is concave on $[0,\\\\infty)$.\\n\\nCheck second derivative.\\n\\nWe have:\\n$$\\nf'(x) = \\\\frac{8 - 2x^3}{(x^3 + 8)^2}\\n$$\\n\\nNow compute $f''(x)$:\\nLet $u = 8 - 2x^3$, $v = (x^3 + 8)^2$\\nThen $f'(x) = u / v$\\n$$\\nf''(x) = \\\\frac{u' v - u v'}{v^2}\\n$$\\n$u' = -6x^2$\\n$v = (x^3 + 8)^2$, so $v' = 2(x^3 + 8)(3x^2) = 6x^2(x^3 + 8)$\\n\\nSo:\\n$$\\nf''(x) = \\\\frac{(-6x^2)(x^3+8)^2 - (8 - 2x^3)(6x^2(x^3+8))}{(x^3+8)^4}\\n$$\\nFactor numerator:\\n= $-6x^2(x^3+8) [ (x^3+8) + (8 - 2x^3) ]$ ? Let's see:\\n\\nFactor out $-6x^2(x^3+8)$:\\nNumerator:\\n$$\\n-6x^2(x^3+8)^2 - 6x^2(x^3+8)(8 - 2x^3) \\\\cdot (-1)?\\n$$\\nWait, sign:\\nFirst term: $-6x^2 (x^3+8)^2$\\nSecond term: $- (8 - 2x^3) \\\\cdot 6x^2(x^3+8) = -6x^2(x^3+8)(8 - 2x^3)$\\nSo total numerator:\\n$$\\n-6x^2(x^3+8) \\\\left[ (x^3+8) + (8 - 2x^3) \\\\right] = -6x^2(x^3+8)(x^3 + 8 + 8 - 2x^3) = -6x^2(x^3+8)(16 - x^3)\\n$$\\nSo:\\n$$\\nf''(x) = \\\\frac{ -6x^2(x^3+8)(16 - x^3) }{(x^3+8)^4} = \\\\frac{ -6x^2(16 - x^3) }{(x^3+8)^3}\\n$$\\nSo sign of $f''(x)$ depends on $-(16 - x^3)$, i.e., $x^3 - 16$.\\n\\nThus, $f''(x) < 0$ when $16 - x^3 > 0$, i.e., $x < \\\\sqrt[3]{16} \\\\approx 2.52$, because of the negative sign.\\n\\nActually:\\n$f''(x) = \\\\frac{ -6x^2(16 - x^3) }{(x^3+8)^3}$\\n\\n- $-6x^2 \\\\le 0$\\n- $(16 - x^3)$: positive when $x^3 < 16$, negative when $x^3 > 16$\\n- Denominator always positive\\n\\nSo:\\n- For $x^3 < 16$: $16 - x^3 > 0$, so numerator: negative × positive = negative → $f''(x) < 0$\\n- For $x^3 > 16$: $16 - x^3 < 0$, so $-(16 - x^3) > 0$, but wait: numerator is $-6x^2(16 - x^3)$, so if $16 - x^3 < 0$, then $(16 - x^3)$ negative, times $-6x^2$ (negative) → negative × negative = positive → $f''(x) > 0$\\n\\nSo $f$ is concave on $[0, \\\\sqrt[3]{16}]$ and convex on $[\\\\sqrt[3]{16}, \\\\infty)$.\\n\\nSince our variables are non-negative and sum to 4, individual values could be up to 4.\\n\\nBut $\\\\sqrt[3]{16} \\\\approx 2.52 < 4$, so beyond that it's convex, so Jensen cannot be applied directly over entire domain.\\n\\nBut note: at $x=1$, which is where equality occurs, $f''(1) = \\\\frac{ -6(1)(16 - 1) }{(1+8)^3} = \\\\frac{-6*15}{729} < 0$, so concave there.\\n\\nIdea: Use the fact that $f(x) \\\\le \\\\frac{4}{9} - k(x-1)^2$ or something, but maybe better to use the following known method: prove that $\\\\frac{x}{x^3+8} \\\\le \\\\frac{4}{9} - m(x-1)$ or use tangent at $x=1$.\\n\\nTry the tangent line method at $x=1$.\\n\\nWe know $f(1) = \\\\frac{1}{9}$\\n$f'(x) = \\\\frac{8 - 2x^3}{(x^3+8)^2}$, so $f'(1) = \\\\frac{8 - 2}{(1+8)^2} = \\\\frac{6}{81} = \\\\frac{2}{27}$\\n\\nTangent line at $x=1$: $y = f(1) + f'(1)(x-1) = \\\\frac{1}{9} + \\\\frac{2}{27}(x-1)$\\n\\nIf we can show that $f(x) \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{9} + \\\\frac{2}{27}(x-1)$ for all $x \\\\ge 0$, then summing:\\n$$\\n\\\\sum f(a) \\\\le \\\\sum \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{9} + \\\\frac{2}{27}(a - 1) \\\\right) = 4 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{9} + \\\\frac{2}{27} \\\\sum (a - 1) = \\\\frac{4}{9} + \\\\frac{2}{27}( (a+b+c+d) - 4 ) = \\\\frac{4}{9} + \\\\frac{2}{27}(0) = \\\\frac{4}{9}\\n$$\\nwhich proves the inequality.\\n\\nSo we need to prove:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{x}{x^3 + 8} \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{9} + \\\\frac{2}{27}(x - 1) \\\\quad \\\\text{for all } x \\\\ge 0\\n$$\\n\\nDefine $g(x) = \\\\frac{1}{9} + \\\\frac{2}{27}(x - 1) - \\\\frac{x}{x^3 + 8}$\\nWe need to show $g(x) \\\\ge 0$ for all $x \\\\ge 0$.\\n\\nSimplify:\\n$g(x) = \\\\frac{1}{9} + \\\\frac{2}{27}x - \\\\frac{2}{27} - \\\\frac{x}{x^3 + 8} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{9} - \\\\frac{2}{27}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{2}{27}x - \\\\frac{x}{x^3 + 8} = \\\\frac{1}{27} + \\\\frac{2}{27}x - \\\\frac{x}{x^3 + 8}$\\n\\nSo:\\n$$\\ng(x) = \\\\frac{1 + 2x}{27} - \\\\frac{x}{x^3 + 8}\\n$$\\nWe need $g(x) \\\\ge 0$, i.e.,\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1 + 2x}{27} \\\\ge \\\\frac{x}{x^3 + 8}\\n$$\\nCross-multiplying (since denominators positive):\\n$$\\n(1 + 2x)(x^3 + 8) \\\\ge 27x\\n$$\\nExpand left:\\n$1 \\\\cdot x^3 + 1 \\\\cdot 8 + 2x \\\\cdot x^3 + 2x \\\\cdot 8 = x^3 + 8 + 2x^4 + 16x = 2x^4 + x^3 + 16x + 8$\\n\\nRight: $27x$\\n\\nSo need:\\n$$\\n2x^4 + x^3 + 16x + 8 \\\\ge 27x \\\\Rightarrow 2x^4 + x^3 -11x + 8 \\\\ge 0\\n$$\\nDefine $h(x) = 2x^4 + x^3 -11x + 8$\\nWe need to show $h(x) \\\\ge 0$ for all $x \\\\ge 0$.\\n\\nCheck $h(0) = 8 > 0$\\n$h(1) = 2 + 1 -11 + 8 = 0$ ✓\\n$h(2) = 2*16 + 8 -22 + 8 = 32 + 8 -22 + 8 = 26 > 0$\\n$h(0.5) = 2*(0.0625) + (0.125) -11*(0.5) + 8 = 0.125 + 0.125 - 5.5 + 8 = 0.25 + 2.5 = 2.75 > 0$\\n\\nNow check derivative to ensure minimum is non-negative.\\n$h'(x) = 8x^3 + 3x^2 -11$\\nSet $h'(x)=0$: $8x^3 + 3x^2 -11 = 0$\\nTry rational roots: possible $x=1$: $8+3-11=0$!

But the problem says \\\"prove the inequality\\\", so there is no numerical answer to box, but since the instruction asks for an answer, likely they want confirmation or the value.\\n\\nLooking back: \\\"Prove the inequality\\\" — but the answer format expects a value. Perhaps they want the maximum value, which is $\\\\frac{4}{9}$, or just confirmation.\\n\\nBut in the context, since it's a proof problem, and the right-hand side is $\\\\frac{4}{9}$, and we've shown it's sharp, probably the answer to put is that the inequality holds, but the format wants a string.\\n\\nBut looking at the example: answer_1 is \\\"42\\\", a number. So likely for this, since it's proving an upper bound, and it's $\\\\frac{4}{9}$, perhaps they want that value.\\n\\nBut the problem doesn't ask for the value, it asks to prove. However, in many contexts, such problems expect the constant as answer if it's tight.\\n\\nBut here, since it's a proof, and the answer is implied, but the instruction says \\\"provide your final answers\\\", probably for Problem 1, since it's a proof, but the answer might be considered as the bound, or perhaps just \\\"proved\\\", but that doesn't fit.\\n\\nRe-examining: the user says \\\"solve the following two problems\\\", and for Problem 1, it's to prove an inequality. But in the answer format, it's expected to have a string. Perhaps the answer is $\\\\frac{4}{9}$, as the maximum.\\n\\nGiven that in the sum, the maximum is $\\\\frac{4}{9}$, and we've shown it, I think the expected answer is $\\\\frac{4}{9}$, but that's already given. Or perhaps they want the number of cases or something, but no.\\n\\nAnother thought: sometimes in such problems, they ask for the minimum or maximum, but here it's to prove an upper bound.\\n\\nBut since the instruction says \\\"your answer to Problem 1\\\", and it's a proof, but in the context of the JSON, likely they expect the value $\\\\frac{4}{9}$ as confirmation.\\n\\nPerhaps the answer is \\\"true\\\" or something, but I think safest is to put the bound, as it's the key value.\\n\\nBut let's see Problem 2 is a count, so numerical.\\n\\nI think for Problem 1, since it's proven, and the maximum is $\\\\frac{4}{9}$, and the inequality is $\\\\le \\\\frac{4}{9}$, the answer is that it holds, but in boxed form, often they put the constant.\\n\\nGiven the format, I'll put $\\\\frac{4}{9}$ as the answer, meaning the right-hand side is sharp.\\n\\nBut actually, rereading: \\\"Prove the inequality\\\" — so no answer needed, but the system requires an answer. Perhaps in such cases, we put the maximum value achieved.\\n\\nI think $\\\\frac{4}{9}$ is fine.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nFind the number of ordered triples $(x,y,n)$ of positive integers with $n>1$ such that\\n$$\\nx^n - y^n = 2^{100}\\n$$\\n\\nWe need to solve $x^n - y^n = 2^{100}$, $x,y,n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^+$, $n > 1$.\\n\\nNote that $x > y$ since LHS positive.\\n\\nRecall that $x^n - y^n = (x-y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \\\\cdots + y^{n-1})$\\n\\nSince the right-hand side is a power of 2, both factors must be powers of 2.\\n\\nLet $d = x - y \\\\ge 1$, and $s = x^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + y^{n-1} \\\\ge 1$, so $d \\\\cdot s = 2^{100}$, and $d,s$ are positive integers, powers of 2.\\n\\nAlso, since $x = y + d$, we can write $s$ in terms of $y$ and $d$.\\n\\nNote that $s = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$\\nWith $x = y + d$, but this might be messy.\\n\\nKnown that for $n$ odd, $x^n - y^n$ can be factored more, but here $n>1$ arbitrary.\\n\\nAnother key point: if $n$ is even, then $x^n - y^n = (x^{n/2})^2 - (y^{n/2})^2 = (x^{n/2} - y^{n/2})(x^{n/2} + y^{n/2})$, but not sure.\\n\\nBut more importantly, we can consider the lifting the exponent lemma (LTE).\\n\\nLTE is useful for $v_p(x^n \\\\pm y^n)$.\\n\\nHere, $p=2$, and $x^n - y^n$, with $x>y>0$, and $n>1$.\\n\\nLTE has conditions for $p=2$.\\n\\nRecall the LTE lemma for $p=2$:\\n\\nFor $x,y$ odd integers, $n$ positive integer, $x \\\\ne y$, then\\n$$\\nv_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2(x - y) + v_2(x + y) + v_2(n) - 1$$\\nunder certain conditions.\\n\\nSpecifically, when $n$ is even, or when $x \\\\equiv y \\\\pmod{4}$, etc. The exact statement:\\n\\nFrom standard LTE:\\n\\nFor $x,y$ odd, $x+y \\\\ne 0$, $n$ a positive integer,\\n- If $n$ is odd, then $v_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2(x - y)$\\n- If $n$ is even, then $v_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2(x - y) + v_2(x + y) + v_2(n) - 1$\\n\\nBut this requires $x,y$ odd.\\n\\nIn our case, $x^n - y^n = 2^{100}$, so the difference is a power of 2, so both $x$ and $y$ must be odd or both even? Not necessarily.\\n\\nSuppose $y$ is even. Then $y^n$ divisible by high power of 2. Similarly $x^n$. But their difference is $2^{100}$.\\n\\nCase 1: both $x$ and $y$ even.\\nLet $x = 2^a u$, $y = 2^b v$, with $u,v$ odd.\\nAssume $a \\\\le b$ without loss of generality? But $x > y$, not necessarily.\\n\\nSince $x^n - y^n = 2^{100}$, the valuation $v_2(x^n - y^n) = 100$.\\n\\nIf $a \\\\ne b$, say $a < b$, then $v_2(x^n) = n a$, $v_2(y^n) = n b > n a$, so $v_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2(x^n) = n a$, since $x^n$ has lower valuation.\\nSimilarly, if $b < a$, then $v_2 = n b$.\\nIf $a = b$, then $v_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2( (2^a u)^n - (2^a v)^n ) = v_2( 2^{a n} (u^n - v^n) ) = a n + v_2(u^n - v^n)$\\nAnd since $u,v$ odd, $u^n - v^n$ even, so $v_2 \\\\ge 1$.\\n\\nNow, in all cases, $v_2(x^n - y^n) = 100$.\\n\\nSubcase 1: $a \\\\ne b$. Without loss of generality, assume $a < b$. Then $v_2 = n a = 100$.\\nSimilarly, if $b < a$, $v_2 = n b = 100$.\\nBut since $x > y$, and if $a < b$, $x$ has smaller 2-power, but $x$ could still be larger if $u$ large, but valuation-wise, $x^n$ dominates if $a < b$.\\n\\nBut $v_2(x^n - y^n) = \\\\min(v_2(x^n), v_2(y^n))$ if $v_2(x^n) \\\\ne v_2(y^n)$, which is when $a \\\\ne b$.\\nSo if $a < b$, $v_2 = n a = 100$.\\nSimilarly if $b < a$, $v_2 = n b = 100$.\\n\\nNow, since $n > 1$, and $a,b$ integers $\\\\ge 0$, $n a = 100$, so $a = 100 / n$, so $n$ must divide 100.\\nSimilarly for $b$.\\n\\nBut also, $x = 2^a u$, $y = 2^b v$, with $u,v$ odd.\\n\\nNow, $x^n - y^n = 2^{n a} u^n - 2^{n b} v^n$\\nIf $a < b$, then $n a < n b$, so factor out $2^{n a}$:\\n$= 2^{n a} (u^n - 2^{n(b-a)} v^n)$\\nNow, $u^n$ is odd, $2^{n(b-a)} v^n$ is even (since $b>a$, $n(b-a) \\\\ge n \\\\ge 2 > 0$), so $u^n - 2^{n(b-a)} v^n$ is odd minus even = odd, so $v_2 = n a$, and the remaining part is odd.\\nBut we have $x^n - y^n = 2^{100} = 2^{n a}$, since $n a = 100$.\\nThus, $2^{n a} (u^n - 2^{n(b-a)} v^n) = 2^{n a}$, so $u^n - 2^{n(b-a)} v^n = 1$\\n\\nSimilarly, if $b < a$, then $v_2 = n b = 100$, and $x^n - y^n = 2^{n b} (2^{n(a-b)} u^n - v^n) = 2^{n b}$, so $2^{n(a-b)} u^n - v^n = 1$\\n\\nNow, also the case $a = b$.\\n\\nSo three subcases.\\n\\nFirst, handle $a \\\\ne b$.\\n\\nSubcase 1: $a < b$, then $n a = 100$, and $u^n - 2^{n(b-a)} v^n = 1$\\n\\nLet $k = b - a > 0$, so $u^n - 2^{n k} v^n = 1$\\n\\nThis is a generalized Pell equation, but specifically $u^n - d v^n = 1$ with $d = 2^{n k} > 1$.\\n\\nFor $n > 1$, the only solution to $u^n - d v^n = 1$ in positive integers is $u=1,v=0$, but $v$ is odd positive integer? $v \\\\ge 1$, but $v=0$ not allowed since $y = 2^b v$, $v$ odd, so $v \\\\ge 1$.\\n\\nCatalan's conjecture (Mihăilescu's theorem) states that the only solution in the natural numbers for $a^b - c^d = 1$ with $a,c > 0$, $b,d > 1$ is $3^2 - 2^3 = 1$.\\n\\nHere, we have $u^n - (2^k v)^n = 1$? No: $u^n - (2^k v)^n = 1$? $2^{n k} v^n = (2^k v)^n$, yes!\\n\\nSo $u^n - w^n = 1$ where $w = 2^k v$\\n\\nSo $u^n - w^n = 1$, with $u,w$ positive integers, $n > 1$.\\n\\nFor $n > 1$, $u^n - w^n = 1$ implies $u > w$, and $(u - w)(\\\\cdots) = 1$, so $u - w = 1$, and the other factor is 1.\\n\\nBut $u^n - w^n = (u-w) \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} u^{n-1-i} w^i$\\nSet $u = w + 1$, then $(w+1)^n - w^n = 1$\\n\\nExpand: $\\\\binom{n}{1} w^{n-1} + \\\\binom{n}{2} w^{n-2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\binom{n}{n-1} w + 1 = 1$\\nSo $\\\\binom{n}{1} w^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + \\\\binom{n}{n-1} w = 0$\\nBut left side $\\\\ge n w^{n-1} \\\\ge n \\\\ge 2 > 0$ for $w \\\\ge 1$, contradiction.\\nIf $w=0$, then $u^n =1$, $u=1$, so $1^n - 0^n =1$, but $0^n =0$ for $n>0$, so yes, but $w=0$, but $w = 2^k v$, $v \\\\ge 1$, $k \\\\ge 1$, so $w \\\\ge 2$, contradiction.\\nThus no solutions when $w \\\\ge 1$.\\n\\nThe only solution to $a^b - c^d =1$ for $a,c>0$, $b,d>1$ is $3^2 - 2^3 =1$, but here the exponents are the same $n$, so $u^n - w^n =1$ with same exponent $n>1$.\\nIs there any solution? $u=1,w=0$: $1^n - 0^n =1-0=1$, but $w=0$, which implies $v=0$, but $v$ is odd positive integer, so $v \\\\ge 1$, $w = 2^k v \\\\ge 2$, so $w \\\\ge 2$, so $u^n \\\\ge w^n +1 \\\\ge 2^n +1 \\\\ge 5$, and $u \\\\ge 2$.\\nBut $u^n - w^n =1$, with $u > w \\\\ge 2$, $n>1$.\\nFor $n=2$, $u^2 - w^2 =1$, $(u-w)(u+w)=1$, so $u-w=1$, $u+w=1$, but then $2u=2$, $u=1$, $w=0$, not $\\\\ge2$.\\nFor $n>2$, even larger gap.\\nSo no solutions.\\n\\nThus, in subcase $a < b$, no solutions.\\nSimilarly, if $b < a$, then $n b = 100$, and $2^{n(a-b)} u^n - v^n =1$\\nLet $m = a - b > 0$, so $2^{n m} u^n - v^n =1$\\nSame thing: $ (2^m u)^n - v^n =1$, so again $A^n - B^n =1$ with $A=2^m u \\\\ge 2$, $B=v \\\\ge 1$, $n>1$, same argument, no solutions except possibly $A=1,B=0$, but $A \\\\ge 2$.\\nSo no solutions in this subcase either.\\n\\nTherefore, the only possibility is $a = b$.\\n\\nSo $v_2(x) = v_2(y) = a$, say.\\nThen $x = 2^a u$, $y = 2^a v$, with $u,v$ odd positive integers, $u > v$ since $x > y$.\\nThen $x^n - y^n = 2^{a n} (u^n - v^n) = 2^{100}$\\nSo $2^{a n} (u^n - v^n) = 2^{100}$, thus $u^n - v^n = 2^{100 - a n}$\\nSince $u,v$ odd, $u^n - v^n$ is even, so $100 - a n \\\\ge 1$.\\nMoreover, $u^n - v^n$ is a power of 2, specifically $2^{k}$ where $k = 100 - a n \\\\ge 1$.\\nNow, since $u$ and $v$ are odd positive integers, $u > v \\\\ge 1$.\\nWe need to solve $u^n - v^n = 2^{k}$ for odd $u,v$, $n>1$, $k \\\\ge 1$.\\nAgain, use LTE or factor.\\nSince $u$ and $v$ odd, we can apply LTE for $p=2$.\\n$v_2(u^n - v^n)$ depends on $n$.\\nCase when $n$ is odd: then $v_2(u^n - v^n) = v_2(u - v)$\\nBecause for odd $n$, $v_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2(x - y)$ when $x,y$ odd.\\nNow, $u - v$ is even, since both odd, so $v_2(u - v) \\\\ge 1$.\\nBut $u^n - v^n = 2^k$, so $v_2 = k$.\\nThus $k = v_2(u - v)$\\nSo $u - v = 2^k m$ for some odd $m$, but $v_2(u - v) = k$, so $u - v = 2^k m$ with $m$ odd.\\nBut $u^n - v^n = 2^k$\\nSince $n$ odd, and $u = v + 2^k m$\\nBut $u^n - v^n = (v + 2^k m)^n - v^n = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\binom{n}{i} v^{n-i} (2^k m)^i = 2^k \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\binom{n}{i} v^{n-i} 2^{k(i-1)} m^i$\\nThe sum is $\\\\binom{n}{1} v^{n-1} m + \\\\binom{n}{2} v^{n-2} 2^{k} m^2 + \\\\cdots$\\nFor $i=1$: $n v^{n-1} m$\\nFor $i \\\\ge 2$: divisible by $2^k$\\nSo the sum is $n v^{n-1} m + 2^k \\\\times \\\\text{(integer)}$\\nThus $u^n - v^n = 2^k \\\\left( n v^{n-1} m + 2^k \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\right) = 2^k$\\nSo $n v^{n-1} m + 2^k \\\\times \\\\cdots = 1$\\nSince $n \\\\ge 2$, $v \\\\ge 1$, $m \\\\ge 1$, $n v^{n-1} m \\\\ge 2 \\\\times 1 \\\\times 1 = 2 > 1$, and the other terms are non-negative, so left side $\\\\ge 2 > 1$, contradiction.\\nUnless $k$ large, but $2^k \\\\times \\\\cdots$ is at least 0, so sum $\\\\ge n v^{n-1} m \\\\ge 2 > 1$.\\nThus no solution when $n$ is odd.\\n\\nTherefore, $n$ must be even.\\n\\nSo $n$ even, $n > 1$.\\nNow, $u^n - v^n = 2^k$, with $k = 100 - a n$\\nSince $n$ even, we can write $u^n - v^n = (u^{n/2})^2 - (v^{n/2})^2 = (u^{n/2} - v^{n/2})(u^{n/2} + v^{n/2})$\\nBut $u^{n/2}$ and $v^{n/2}$ may not be integers, but since $u,v$ odd, and $n/2$ integer, yes, they are integers.\\nSet $A = u^{n/2}$, $B = v^{n/2}$, then $A^2 - B^2 = (A-B)(A+B) = 2^k$\\nAnd $A,B$ are positive integers, $A > B$, since $u > v$.\\nAlso, since $u,v$ odd, $A,B$ odd.\\nNow, $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both even, since $A,B$ odd, so $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both even, and their product is $2^k$.\\nMoreover, $A-B$ and $A+B$ have the same parity (both even), and $(A+B) - (A-B) = 2B$, so their difference is $2B$, even.\\nAlso, since $A$ and $B$ are both odd, $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both divisible by 2, but not by 4? Not necessarily.\\nActually, odd minus odd is even, could be divisible by 2 or higher.\\nBut more importantly, $\\\\gcd(A-B, A+B)$ divides $2B$ and $2A$, and since $A,B$ coprime? Not necessarily.\\nBut $\\\\gcd(A-B, A+B)$ divides $(A+B) + (A-B) = 2A$ and $(A+B) - (A-B) = 2B$, so divides $2\\\\gcd(A,B)$.\\nBut $\\\\gcd(A,B) = \\\\gcd(u^{n/2}, v^{n/2})$, and since $u,v$ may have common factors.\\nBut in general, let $d = \\\\gcd(A-B, A+B)$, then $d | 2\\\\gcd(A,B)$.\\nBut to simplify, since $(A-B)(A+B) = 2^k$, and both factors are positive integers, even, and $A-B < A+B$, and $A-B \\\\ge 1$, but since both even, $A-B \\\\ge 2$? No, could be 2, but minimum: since $A > B$, $A-B \\\\ge 1$, but both even, so $A-B \\\\ge 2$.\\nSimilarly $A+B \\\\ge A-B + 2B \\\\ge 2 + 2 = 4$ since $B \\\\ge 1$.\\nNow, set $d = A-B$, $e = A+B$, then $d e = 2^k$, $d$ and $e$ even, $d < e$ (since $B > 0$), and $e - d = 2B > 0$, and $d$ and $e$ have the same parity (both even), and since their product is power of 2, both $d$ and $e$ are powers of 2.\\nMoreover, since $d$ and $e$ are both powers of 2, and $d < e$, and $e - d = 2B$.\\nAlso, $A = (d+e)/2$, $B = (e-d)/2$, so for $A$ and $B$ to be integers, $d$ and $e$ must be both even, which they are, and since they are powers of 2, and $d < e$, set $d = 2^r$, $e = 2^s$, with $r < s$, $r \\\\ge 1$ (since $d \\\\ge 2$), $s \\\\ge 2$ (since $e \\\\ge 4$), and $r + s = k$.\\nThen $e - d = 2^s - 2^r = 2^r (2^{s-r} - 1) = 2B$\\nSo $B = 2^{r-1} (2^{s-r} - 1)$\\nSimilarly, $A = (2^r + 2^s)/2 = 2^{r-1} + 2^{s-1}$\\nNow, $B = v^{n/2}$, and $v$ is odd positive integer, so $B$ must be odd, but here $B = 2^{r-1} (2^{s-r} - 1)$\\nNow, $2^{s-r} - 1$ is odd, so for $B$ to be odd, we need $2^{r-1} = 1$, so $r-1 = 0$, i.e., $r=1$\\nThen $B = 2^{0} (2^{s-1} - 1) = 2^{s-1} - 1$\\nAnd $d = 2^r = 2^1 = 2$\\n$e = 2^s$\\n$k = r + s = 1 + s$\\nSo $s = k - 1$\\nThen $B = 2^{s-1} - 1 = 2^{k-2} - 1$\\nSince $s = k - 1$, $B = 2^{(k-1)-1} - 1 = 2^{k-2} - 1$\\nNow, $B = v^{n/2} \\\\ge 1$, so $2^{k-2} - 1 \\\\ge 1$, so $2^{k-2} \\\\ge 2$, so $k-2 \\\\ge 1$, $k \\\\ge 3$\\nAlso, $A = 2^{r-1} + 2^{s-1} = 2^0 + 2^{s-1} = 1 + 2^{s-1} = 1 + 2^{k-2}$\\nAnd $A = u^{n/2}$\\nNow, recall that $k = 100 - a n$\\nAnd $n$ is even, $n > 1$.\\nNow, $B = v^{n/2} = 2^{k-2} - 1$\\n$A = u^{n/2} = 1 + 2^{k-2}$\\nSince $u$ and $v$ are odd integers $\\\\ge 1$, and $n/2 \\\\ge 1$ since $n \\\\ge 2$.\\nNow, $v^{n/2} = 2^{k-2} - 1$\\n$u^{n/2} = 2^{k-2} + 1$\\nNote that $u^{n/2} - v^{n/2} = (2^{k-2} + 1) - (2^{k-2} - 1) = 2$\\nBut $u^{n/2} - v^{n/2} = A - B = (d+e)/2 - (e-d)/2 = (2d)/2 = d = 2$, yes, consistent.\\nWe need $v^{n/2} = 2^{k-2} - 1$ and $u^{n/2} = 2^{k-2} + 1$ to be perfect powers.\\nSpecifically, since $n/2$ is an integer $\\\\ge 1$, let $m = n/2 \\\\ge 1$, so $n = 2m$, $m \\\\ge 1$.\\nThen $v^m = 2^{k-2} - 1$\\n$u^m = 2^{k-2} + 1$\\nAnd $u^m - v^m = 2$\\nNow, $m \\\\ge 1$, and $u,v$ odd positive integers, $u > v$.\\nNow, $u^m - v^m = 2$\\nFor $m=1$: $u - v = 2$, and $v = 2^{k-2} - 1$, $u = 2^{k-2} + 1$, so $u - v = (2^{k-2} + 1) - (2^{k-2} - 1) = 2$, yes, always true for any $k$.\\nBut $v = 2^{k-2} - 1 \\\\ge 1$, so $k \\\\ge 3$, and $v$ must be positive integer, which it is.\\nAlso, $u = 2^{k-2} + 1$, both odd, good.\\nFor $m > 1$: $u^m - v^m = 2$\\nSince $u > v \\\\ge 1$, $u \\\\ge v+1$\\nThen $u^m - v^m \\\\ge (v+1)^m - v^m = \\\\binom{m}{1} v^{m-1} + \\\\cdots + 1 \\\\ge m v^{m-1} \\\\ge m \\\\ge 2$\\nEquality holds only if $m=2$ and $v=1$, and $(v+1)^m - v^m = 2^2 - 1^2 = 4-1=3>2$, or if $v=1$, $m=2$: $u^2 - 1^2 =2$, so $u^2=3$, not integer.\\nCheck: $u^m - v^m =2$\\nFor $m=2$: $u^2 - v^2 = (u-v)(u+v) =2$\\nSince $u>v>0$ integers, $u-v \\\\ge 1$, $u+v \\\\ge u-v + 2v \\\\ge 1 + 2=3 >2$, so $(u-v)(u+v) \\\\ge 1 \\\\times 3 =3 >2$, contradiction.\\nFor $m>2$, even larger.\\nSo only possible when $m=1$.\\nThus $m=1$, so $n/2 =1$, $n=2$\\nThen $v^1 = 2^{k-2} - 1$, $u^1 = 2^{k-2} + 1$\\nSo $v = 2^{k-2} - 1$, $u = 2^{k-2} + 1$\\nNow, $k = 100 - a n = 100 - a \\\\cdot 2 = 100 - 2a$\\nSince $n=2$\\nNow, $k \\\\ge 3$, as earlier.\\nAlso, $v = 2^{k-2} - 1 \\\\ge 1$, so $2^{k-2} \\\\ge 2$, $k-2 \\\\ge 1$, $k \\\\ge 3$, same.\\nNow, $a$ is a non-negative integer, since $v_2(x) = a$\\nNow, $k = 100 - 2a$, so $k \\\\ge 3$ implies $100 - 2a \\\\ge 3$, so $2a \\\\le 97$, $a \\\\le 48.5$, so $a \\\\le 48$\\nAlso, $k = 100 - 2a \\\\ge 1$?

But $u>v$, since $x>y$.\\nOr if $u=v$, then $x=y$, $x^n - y^n=0 \\\\ne 2^{100}$.\\nSo no.\\nThus, only solutions are the 49 triples with $n=2$, and $a=0$ to $48$.\\nBut each $a$ gives a different triple, so 49 ordered triples.\\nBut let me confirm with small $a$.\\nSay $a=0$: $x=2^{98} + 1$, $y=2^{98} - 1$, $n=2$\\n$x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y) = (2)(2^{99}) = 2^{100}$, yes.\\n$a=1$: $x=2^{97} + 2^1 = 2^{97} + 2$, $y=2^{97} - 2$, $n=2$\\n$x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y) = (4)(2 \\\\cdot 2^{97}) = 4 \\\\cdot 2^{98} = 2^2 \\\\cdot 2^{98} = 2^{100}$, yes.\\n$a=48$: $x=2^{50} + 2^{48}$, $y=2^{50} - 2^{48}$, $x-y=2^{49}$, $x+y=2^{51}$, product $2^{49+51}=2^{100}$, yes.\\nNow, $a=49$: would give $k=100-98=2$, $v=2^{2-2}-1=1-1=0$, $y=2^{49} \\\\cdot 0=0$, but $y$ must be positive integer, so invalid.\\nSimilarly, $a=50$: $k=0$, $u^2 - v^2=1$, $u=1,v=0$, same.\\nNow, is there a solution where $n>2$?\\nSuppose $n=4$, is it possible?\\nEarlier we saw that only $n=2$ works, but let me see.\\nSuppose $n=4$, then from earlier, $a=b$, $k=100-4a$, $u^4 - v^4 = 2^k$\\n$u^4 - v^4 = (u^2 - v^2)(u^2 + v^2) = 2^k$\\nBoth factors even, since $u,v$ odd.\\nSet $d=u^2 - v^2$, $e=u^2 + v^2$, $d e = 2^k$, $d,e$ even, $d<e$, both powers of 2.\\n$d=2^r$, $e=2^s$, $r<s$, $r+s=k$\\nThen $e - d = 2 v^2$, so $2^s - 2^r = 2 v^2$\\n$v^2 = 2^{s-1} - 2^{r-1} = 2^{r-1} (2^{s-r} - 1)$\\n$v$ odd, so $v^2$ odd, so $2^{r-1} =1$, $r=1$\\nThen $v^2 = 2^{0} (2^{s-1} - 1) = 2^{s-1} - 1$\\nSimilarly, $u^2 = (d+e)/2 = (2^r + 2^s)/2 = 2^{r-1} + 2^{s-1} = 1 + 2^{s-1}$\\nSo $u^2 = 2^{s-1} + 1$, $v^2 = 2^{s-1} - 1$\\nNow, $u^2 - v^2 = (2^{s-1} + 1) - (2^{s-1} - 1) = 2$, but also $u^2 - v^2 = d = 2^r = 2^1 = 2$, yes.\\nNow, $v^2 = 2^{s-1} - 1$\\nMust be perfect square.\\nSimilarly $u^2 = 2^{s-1} + 1$\\nNow, $k=r+s=1+s$\\n$k=100-4a$\\n$s=k-1=99-4a$\\n$v^2 = 2^{s-1} - 1 = 2^{98 - 4a} - 1$\\nMust be perfect square.\\nSimilarly, $u^2 = 2^{98-4a} + 1$\\nNow, $2^m - 1$ is perfect square only for small $m$.\\nKnown that $2^m - 1 = k^2$ has solutions $m=1$: $1=1^2$, $m=3$: $8-1=7$ not square, $m=0$: $0$ not positive.\\n$m=1$: $2^1 -1=1=1^2$\\n$m=2$: $4-1=3$ no\\n$m=3$:7 no\\n$m=4$:15 no\\n$m=5$:31 no\\n$m=6$:63 no\\n$m=7$:127 no\\n$m=8$:255 no\\n$m=9$:511 no\\n$m=10$:1023 no\\nOnly $m=1$ and $m=0$, but $m=98-4a$\\nSet $m=98-4a$\\n$v^2 = 2^m - 1$\\nSolutions: $m=1$: $2^1 -1=1=1^2$\\n$m=0$: $1-1=0=0^2$, but $v=0$ not positive.\\nIs there any other? It's a known result that the only solution to $2^m - 1 = k^2$ is $m=1,k=1$ and $m=0,k=0$.\\nSimilarly, $u^2 = 2^m + 1$, for $m=1$: $3$ not square, $m=2$:5 no, $m=3$:9=3^2$, oh! $2^3 +1=9=3^2$\\nBut here $v^2 = 2^m -1$, for $m=3$: $8-1=7$ not square.\\nWe need both $2^m -1$ and $2^m +1$ to be squares? No, in this case for $n=4$, we have $v^2 = 2^{s-1} -1$, $u^2 = 2^{s-1} +1$, so let $t = s-1$, then $v^2 = 2^t -1$, $u^2 = 2^t +1$\\nSo we need $2^t -1$ and $2^t +1$ both perfect squares.\\nBut $2^t +1$ and $2^t -1$ differ by 2.\\nTwo squares differing by 2: only $1$ and $3$? $1^2=1$, $2^2=4$, differ by 3; $0^2=0$, $1^2=1$, differ by 1; $3^2=9$, $2^2=4$, differ by 5. Only $1^2$ and $(-1)^2$, but same. Actually, $3^2 - 2^2 = 9-4=5$, $2^2 - 1^2=4-1=3$, $1^2 - 0^2=1$. No two distinct squares differ by 2. Because if $a^2 - b^2 =2$, $(a-b)(a+b)=2$, so possibilities: $a-b=1$, $a+b=2$, then $a=1.5$, not integer. Or $a-b=2$, $a+b=1$, impossible. So no integer solutions. Thus, no solution for $n=4$. Similarly for higher $n$. But in our earlier general argument, we already covered that only $m=1$ for the exponent, so only $n=2$. Thus, only solutions are for $n=2$, $a=0$ to $48$, 49 triples. But in the triple, $x$ and $y$ are determined, and $n=2$. Now, is there a solution where $x=y$? No. Or $y=0$? But $y$ positive integer, so no. Also, in our solutions, $y = 2^{98-a} - 2^a >0$ for $a<49$, which is satisfied. Now, total 49 solutions. But let me check $a=49$: not included. $a=48$ is last. $a$ from 0 to 48 inclusive: number is 49. But is $a=49$ possible with different $n$? We saw not. Another thing: when $a=49$, $k=100-2*49=100-98=2$, but for $n=2$, $u^2 - v^2 = 2^2 =4$? No, $k=100 - a n =100 -49*2=100-98=2$, so $u^2 - v^2 = 2^k = 4$ Then $(u-v)(u+v)=4$ Possibilities: $u-v=1$, $u+v=4$, then $u=2.5$, not integer. $u-v=2$, $u+v=2$, then $u=2,v=0$, but $v=0$ invalid. So no. Similarly. So only the 49 solutions. But in the triple, $x,y,n$, and for each $a$, we have one. But notice that when $a$ and $98-a$ might give same? For example, $a=0$: $x=2^{98}+1$, $y=2^{98}-1$ $a=98$: but $a=98>48$, not in range. $a=48$: $x=2^{50}+2^{48}$, $y=2^{50}-2^{48}$ $a=50$: not allowed. But $a$ and $98-a$: for $a=0$, $98-a=98$; $a=48$, $98-a=50$. Different. All $x$ are different. So 49 distinct triples. But is there a symmetric one? For example, if I take $a$ and $b$ such that, but no, each $a$ gives unique $x$. Since $x = 2^{98-a} + 2^a$, and for $a < 49$, this is minimized when $a=49$, but $a\\\\le48$, and it's symmetric around $a=49$, but since $a$ integer, $a=48$ and $a=50$ would be symmetric, but $a=50$ not allowed. So all good. Thus, number of ordered triples is 49. But let me confirm the range: $a=0,1,2,...,48$ That's 49 values. Answer should be 49. But in the problem, $x,y,n$ positive integers, $n>1$, all satisfied. So for Problem 1, since it's a proof, but the answer is the bound, I'll put $\\\\frac{4}{9}$, and for Problem 2, 49.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4/9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"49\"\n}",
