We want to find the probability that the transformed point $(u, v) = (3x + 2y, x + 4y)$ lies in $S$, i.e., $0 \\\\leq u \\\\leq 1$ and $0 \\\\leq v \\\\leq 1$.\\n\\nSo we need:\\n$$\\n0 \\\\leq 3x + 2y \\\\leq 1 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq x + 4y \\\\leq 1\\n$$\\nSince $x, y \\\\in [0,1]$, all expressions are non-negative, so the lower bounds $\\\\geq 0$ are automatically satisfied. So we only need:\\n$$\\n3x + 2y \\\\leq 1 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad x + 4y \\\\leq 1\\n$$\\nWe now compute the area of the region in the unit square satisfying both inequalities, and divide by 1 (the total area) to get the probability.\\n\\nLet’s find the intersection of the two lines:\\n- $3x + 2y = 1$\\n- $x + 4y = 1$\\n\\nSolve the system:\\nFrom the second equation: $x = 1 - 4y$. Plug into first:\\n$$\\n3(1 - 4y) + 2y = 1 \\\\Rightarrow 3 - 12y + 2y = 1 \\\\Rightarrow -10y = -2 \\\\Rightarrow y = \\\\frac{1}{5}\\n$$\\nThen $x = 1 - 4 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{5} = 1 - \\\\frac{4}{5} = \\\\frac{1}{5}$.\\n\\nSo the two lines intersect at $(\\\\frac{1}{5}, \\\\frac{1}{5})$.\\n\\nNow find where each line intersects the boundaries of the square.\\n\\nFor $3x + 2y = 1$:\\n- When $x=0$: $2y=1 \\\\Rightarrow y=0.5$\\n- When $y=0$: $3x=1 \\\\Rightarrow x=1/3$\\n\\nFor $x + 4y = 1$:\\n- When $x=0$: $4y=1 \\\\Rightarrow y=0.25$\\n- When $y=0$: $x=1$\\n\\nNow sketch the feasible region:\\nWe are in the unit square, and we want the region below both lines.\\n\\nThe region defined by $3x+2y \\\\leq 1$ and $x+4y \\\\leq 1$ with $x,y \\\\geq 0$ is a polygon bounded by:\\n- $(0,0)$ — satisfies both\\n- Along $x=0$: up to where? At $x=0$, $3x+2y \\\\leq 1 \\\\Rightarrow y \\\\leq 0.5$, but $x+4y \\\\leq 1 \\\\Rightarrow y \\\\leq 0.25$. So tighter bound is $y \\\\leq 0.25$. But does the region go up to $(0,0.25)$?\\nWait — better to find vertices of the feasible region.\\n\\nFind corner points:\\n\\n1. Intersection with axes and each other.\\n\\nVertices of the region:\\n- $(0,0)$: clearly satisfies both.\\n- Where $3x+2y=1$ meets $y=0$: $(1/3, 0)$, but check second inequality: $x + 4y = 1/3 \\\\leq 1$: OK. Is this on the boundary?\\nBut is it in the region? Yes, but we must see if it's a vertex.\\n- Where $x+4y=1$ meets $y=0$: $(1,0)$, but check first inequality: $3(1)+0=3 >1$: violates. So not in region.\\n- Where $3x+2y=1$ meets $x=0$: $(0,0.5)$, but check $x+4y = 0 + 4*(0.5)=2 >1$: violates.\\n- Where $x+4y=1$ meets $x=0$: $(0,0.25)$, check $3x+2y = 0 + 2*0.25 = 0.5 \\\\leq 1$: OK.\\n- Intersection point: $(1/5,1/5) = (0.2,0.2)$\\n\\nNow, let's trace the feasible region.\\nStart from $(0,0)$:\\n- Move along $x$-axis: until $3x \\\\leq 1 \\\\Rightarrow x \\\\leq 1/3$, but also $x \\\\leq 1$, so up to $x=1/3$. But at $(1/3,0)$, $x+4y=1/3 <1$: OK. So $(1/3,0)$ is in.\\nBut is it a vertex? Let's see which constraints are tight.\\n\\nActually, the region is bounded by:\\n- From $(0,0)$ to $(1/3,0)$ along $y=0$: but wait, at $(1/3,0)$, $3x+2y=1$, and $x+4y=1/3<1$.\\nBut from $(1/3,0)$, can we go up? No, because above that, $3x+2y>1$ if we increase $y$ or $x$.\\nBut maybe the binding constraint changes.\\n\\nBetter: the feasible region is a polygon whose vertices are:\\n1. $(0,0)$\\n2. $(1/3, 0)$ — where $3x+2y=1$ hits $y=0$\\n3. $(1/5,1/5)$ — intersection of two lines\\n4. $(0,1/4)$ — where $x+4y=1$ hits $x=0$\\n\\nWait: at $(0,1/4)=(0,0.25)$, check $3x+2y=0+0.5=0.5\\\\leq1$: OK.\\nAt $(1/5,1/5)=(0.2,0.2)$: $3(0.2)+2(0.2)=0.6+0.4=1$, and $0.2+0.8=1$: both equalities hold.\\nNow, is the segment from $(1/5,1/5)$ to $(0,0.25)$ part of $x+4y=1$? Yes.\\nFrom $(0,0.25)$ to $(0,0)$: along $x=0$? But at $x=0$, $y$ from 0 to 0.25: check $3x+2y=2y\\\\leq1 \\\\Rightarrow y\\\\leq0.5$, so yes, allowed. But is the entire vertical segment included?\\nWait — no: from $(0,0)$ to $(0,0.25)$ is allowed, but then from $(0,0.25)$ to $(0.2,0.2)$ along $x+4y=1$, then from $(0.2,0.2)$ to $(1/3,0)$ along $3x+2y=1$, then back to $(0,0)$ along $y=0$?\\nBut $(1/3,0) \\\\approx (0.333,0)$, and $(0.2,0.2)$ to $(0.333,0)$: let's verify if that segment satisfies $x+4y\\\\leq1$.\\nTake midpoint: $x=0.2665, y=0.1$: $x+4y=0.2665+0.4=0.6665<1$: OK.\\nAnd $3x+2y=0.7995+0.2=0.9995<1$: close, but since it's on the line? Wait, the segment from $(0.2,0.2)$ to $(1/3,0)$ is along $3x+2y=1$?\\nCheck: at $(1/3,0)$: $3*(1/3)+0=1$: yes.\\nAt $(0.2,0.2)$: $0.6+0.4=1$: yes.\\nSo yes, that segment is on $3x+2y=1$.\\n\\nNow, is the region bounded by:\\n- $(0,0)$\\n- $(1/3,0)$\\n- $(0.2,0.2)$\\n- $(0,0.25)$\\n- back to $(0,0)$?\\nBut $(0,0.25)$ to $(0,0)$ is along $x=0$, but is that edge part of the boundary?\\nAt $x=0$, the constraints are $2y\\\\leq1$ and $4y\\\\leq1$, so $y\\\\leq0.25$. So yes, from $y=0$ to $y=0.25$.\\nBut now, the polygon has five vertices? Wait: from $(0,0)$ to $(1/3,0)$ to $(0.2,0.2)$ to $(0,0.25)$ to $(0,0)$: that's four segments, but $(0,0)$ appears twice.\\nVertices: $(0,0), (1/3,0), (1/5,1/5), (0,1/4)$.\\nIs $(0,0)$ connected directly to $(0,1/4)$? Yes, along $x=0$.\\nBut is the segment from $(0,1/4)$ to $(1/5,1/5)$ part of $x+4y=1$? Let's check:\\nAt $(0,0.25)$: $0+4*0.25=1$: yes.\\nAt $(0.2,0.2)$: $0.2+0.8=1$: yes.\\nSo that segment is on $x+4y=1$.\\nSimilarly, from $(0.2,0.2)$ to $(1/3,0)$ on $3x+2y=1$.\\nFrom $(1/3,0)$ to $(0,0)$ on $y=0$.\\nFrom $(0,0)$ to $(0,0.25)$ on $x=0$.\\nBut this would make a quadrilateral? Wait, no: we have four points, but the path is: $(0,0) \\\\to (1/3,0) \\\\to (1/5,1/5) \\\\to (0,1/4) \\\\to (0,0)$.\\nYes, a quadrilateral.\\nBut is $(0,0)$ connected directly to $(1/3,0)$? Yes, along $y=0$.\\nAnd $(0,1/4)$ to $(0,0)$ along $x=0$.\\nSo the region is a quadrilateral with vertices:\\n- $A = (0,0)$\\n- $B = (1/3, 0)$\\n- $C = (1/5, 1/5)$\\n- $D = (0, 1/4)$\\n\\nBut wait: is the point $(0,0)$ included in all constraints? Yes.\\nNow, to find the area of polygon with vertices $(0,0), (1/3,0), (1/5,1/5), (0,1/4)$.\\nBut plotting: from $(0,0)$ to $(1/3,0) \\\\approx (0.333,0)$, then to $(0.2,0.2)$, then to $(0,0.25)$, then back to $(0,0)$.\\nThis seems correct.\\n\\nBut is the segment from $(1/3,0)$ to $(1/5,1/5)$ entirely within the unit square? Yes.\\nNow, to compute the area of this quadrilateral.\\nWe can use the shoelace formula.\\nList the vertices in order, say clockwise or counterclockwise.\\nLet’s go counterclockwise:\\nStart at $(0,0)$, then to $(1/3,0)$, then to $(1/5,1/5)$, then to $(0,1/4)$, then back to $(0,0)$.\\nCoordinates:\\n1. $(0,0)$\\n2. $(1/3, 0) = (0.333..., 0)$\\n3. $(1/5, 1/5) = (0.2, 0.2)$\\n4. $(0, 0.25)$\\nBack to $(0,0)$\\n\\nShoelace formula:\\nArea = $\\\\frac{1}{2} |\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|$\\nWith $(x_5,y_5) = (x_1,y_1)$\\n\\nCompute:\\ni=1: $x1=0,y1=0; x2=1/3,y2=0$\\n$ x1 y2 - x2 y1 = 0*0 - (1/3)*0 = 0 $\\n\\ni=2: $x2=1/3,y2=0; x3=1/5,y3=1/5$\\n$ (1/3)(1/5) - (1/5)(0) = 1/15 - 0 = 1/15 $\\n\\ni=3: $x3=1/5,y3=1/5; x4=0,y4=1/4$\\n$ (1/5)(1/4) - (0)(1/5) = 1/20 - 0 = 1/20 $\\n\\ni=4: $x4=0,y4=1/4; x1=0,y1=0$\\n$ 0*0 - 0*(1/4) = 0 - 0 = 0 $\\n\\nSum = $0 + 1/15 + 1/20 + 0 = 1/15 + 1/20$\\nLCM of 15 and 20 is 60:\\n$4/60 + 3/60 = 7/60$\\nThen area = $\\\\frac{1}{2} |7/60| = 7/120$\\n\\nBut this is less than 0.1, while the whole square is 1. But let me verify if this makes sense.\\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is wrong? Because when I go from $(1/3,0)$ to $(0.2,0.2)$ to $(0,0.25)$, and back to $(0,0)$, but from $(0,0.25)$ to $(0,0)$ is down the y-axis, but the point $(0,0)$ is already connected.\\nBut shoelace gave positive sum, but let me plot the points:\\n- (0,0)\\n- (0.333,0)\\n- (0.2,0.2)\\n- (0,0.25)\\nConnecting them in order: from origin right to (1/3,0), then to (0.2,0.2) which is left and up, then to (0,0.25) left and up a bit, then down to (0,0).\\nThis should be a simple quadrilateral.\\nBut shoelace sum was $1/15 + 1/20 = 7/60$, times 1/2 is 7/120 ≈ 0.0583.\\nBut is this correct? Let me check the area another way.\\n\\nWe can split the quadrilateral into two parts:\\n1. Triangle from $(0,0), (1/3,0), (0,0.25)$ — but no, because $(1/5,1/5)$ is not inside.\\nBetter: split into triangle $(0,0), (1/3,0), (1/5,1/5)$ and triangle $(0,0), (1/5,1/5), (0,0.25)$ — but they overlap or miss.\\nBetter: since from $(0,0)$ to $(1/3,0)$ to $(1/5,1/5)$ to $(0,0.25)$ to $(0,0)$, we can split along the diagonal from $(0,0)$ to $(1/5,1/5)$, or from $(1/3,0)$ to $(0,0.25)$.\\nEasier: use geometry.\\n\\nNote that the region is bounded by $x \\\\geq 0, y \\\\geq 0, 3x+2y \\\\leq 1, x+4y \\\\leq 1$.\\nTo find the area, integrate.\\nWe can integrate with respect to $x$ from 0 to 1/3, but the upper bound for $y$ depends on $x$.\\nFind for each $x$, the range of $y$.\\n\\nFrom $3x+2y \\\\leq 1 \\\\Rightarrow y \\\\leq \\\\frac{1 - 3x}{2}$\\nFrom $x+4y \\\\leq 1 \\\\Rightarrow y \\\\leq \\\\frac{1 - x}{4}$\\nAlso $y \\\\geq 0$.\\nSo $y \\\\leq \\\\min\\\\left( \\\\frac{1-3x}{2}, \\\\frac{1-x}{4} \\\\right)$\\nNow, find where these two are equal:\\n$\\\\frac{1-3x}{2} = \\\\frac{1-x}{4}$\\nMultiply both sides by 4: $2(1-3x) = 1-x \\\\Rightarrow 2 - 6x = 1 - x \\\\Rightarrow 2-1 = 6x - x \\\\Rightarrow 1 = 5x \\\\Rightarrow x = 1/5$\\nFor $x < 1/5$, which one is smaller?\\nAt $x=0$: $\\\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$, $\\\\frac{1}{4}=0.25$, so min is $\\\\frac{1-x}{4}$\\nAt $x=0.3 > 0.2$: $\\\\frac{1-0.9}{2}=0.1/2=0.05$, $\\\\frac{1-0.3}{4}=0.7/4=0.175$, so min is $\\\\frac{1-3x}{2}$\\nSo:\\n- For $0 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 1/5$, $y \\\\leq \\\\frac{1-x}{4}$\\n- For $1/5 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 1/3$, $y \\\\leq \\\\frac{1-3x}{2}$\\nNote that at $x=1/3$, $\\\\frac{1-3x}{2}=0$, so $y=0$.\\nAlso, $x$ cannot exceed $1/3$ because otherwise $3x>1$, so $y<0$ impossible.\\n\\nSo area = $\\\\int_{x=0}^{1/5} \\\\frac{1-x}{4}  dx + \\\\int_{x=1/5}^{1/3} \\\\frac{1-3x}{2}  dx$\\n\\nFirst integral: $\\\\int_0^{0.2} \\\\frac{1-x}{4} dx = \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\int_0^{0.2} (1-x) dx = \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\left[ x - \\\\frac{x^2}{2} \\\\right]_0^{0.2} = \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\left( 0.2 - \\\\frac{0.04}{2} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{4} (0.2 - 0.02) = \\\\frac{1}{4}(0.18) = 0.045$\\nIn fractions: $x=1/5$\\n$\\\\int_0^{1/5} (1-x) dx = \\\\left[ x - \\\\frac{x^2}{2} \\\\right]_0^{1/5} = \\\\frac{1}{5} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{25} = \\\\frac{1}{5} - \\\\frac{1}{50} = \\\\frac{10}{50} - \\\\frac{1}{50} = \\\\frac{9}{50}$\\nThen multiply by $1/4$: $\\\\frac{9}{50} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{4} = \\\\frac{9}{200}$\\n\\nSecond integral: $\\\\int_{1/5}^{1/3} \\\\frac{1-3x}{2} dx = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int_{1/5}^{1/3} (1-3x) dx = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left[ x - \\\\frac{3x^2}{2} \\\\right]_{1/5}^{1/3}$\\nFirst, at $x=1/3$: $\\\\frac{1}{3} - \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{9} = \\\\frac{1}{3} - \\\\frac{3}{18} = \\\\frac{1}{3} - \\\\frac{1}{6} = \\\\frac{2}{6} - \\\\frac{1}{6} = \\\\frac{1}{6}$\\nAt $x=1/5$: $\\\\frac{1}{5} - \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{25} = \\\\frac{1}{5} - \\\\frac{3}{50} = \\\\frac{10}{50} - \\\\frac{3}{50} = \\\\frac{7}{50}$\\nSo difference: $\\\\frac{1}{6} - \\\\frac{7}{50} = \\\\frac{25}{150} - \\\\frac{21}{150} = \\\\frac{4}{150} = \\\\frac{2}{75}$\\nThen multiply by $1/2$: $\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{2}{75} = \\\\frac{1}{75}$\\n\\nTotal area = $\\\\frac{9}{200} + \\\\frac{1}{75}$\\nLCM of 200 and 75: 200=8*25, 75=3*25, so LCM 600.\\n$\\\\frac{9}{200} = \\\\frac{9*3}{600} = \\\\frac{27}{600}$\\n$\\\\frac{1}{75} = \\\\frac{8}{600}$? 75*8=600, so $1/75 = 8/600$? 600 / 75 = 8, so yes, $1/75 = 8/600$\\nBut $\\\\frac{1}{75} = \\\\frac{8}{600}$? 8/600 = 1/75? 600/8=75, yes.\\nBut earlier I have $\\\\frac{1}{75}$ from the second integral, but that's after multiplying by 1/2, so yes.\\nSo total: $\\\\frac{27}{600} + \\\\frac{8}{600} = \\\\frac{35}{600} = \\\\frac{7}{120}$\\nSame as shoelace! So area is $\\\\frac{7}{120}$\\n\\nSo probability is $\\\\frac{7}{120}$\\nBut is this reduced? gcd(7,120)=1, yes.\\nSo $a=7, b=120$, then $100a + b = 100*7 + 120 = 700 + 120 = 820$\\n\\nBut wait: is this correct? I think I missed something.\\nThe transformation is $(u,v) = (3x+2y, x+4y)$, and we require $0 \\\\leq u \\\\leq 1$ and $0 \\\\leq v \\\\leq 1$.\\nI assumed that since $x,y \\\\geq 0$, $u,v \\\\geq 0$ automatically, which is true.\\nAnd I found the area where $u \\\\leq 1$ and $v \\\\leq 1$, which is correct.\\nAnd the total area is 1, so probability is $7/120$.\\nBut let me verify with a point.\\nAt $(0,0)$: $(0,0)$ in S, and $(0,0)$ maps to $(0,0)$ in S: good.\\nAt $(1/3,0)$: maps to $(3*(1/3)+0, 1/3 +0) = (1,1/3)$: $u=1\\\\leq1$, $v=1/3\\\\leq1$: good.\\nAt $(0.2,0.2)$: $(3*0.2+2*0.2, 0.2+4*0.2)=(0.6+0.4,0.2+0.8)=(1,1)$: on corner.\\nAt $(0,0.25)$: $(0+2*0.25, 0+4*0.25)=(0.5,1)$: $u=0.5\\\\leq1$, $v=1\\\\leq1$: good.\\nNow, a point outside, say $(0.3,0.1)$: $x=0.3>1/3? 1/3≈0.333, so 0.3<0.333, but $3x+2y=0.9+0.2=1.1>1$, so not in region. And indeed, $u=1.1>1$, so correctly excluded.\\nAnother point: $(0.1,0.3)$: $v=x+4y=0.1+1.2=1.3>1$, and $y=0.3>0.25$, and $x=0.1<0.2$, so should be cut by $v\\\\leq1$. $\\\\frac{1-x}{4}=0.9/4=0.225<0.3$, so yes, excluded.\\nSo seems correct.\\n\\nThus for Problem 1: $a=7,b=120$, $100a+b=700+120=820$\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nIn bridge, 52 cards dealt to 4 players, so each gets 13 cards.\\nWe are given that a particular hand has exactly 4 cards that are A,K,Q,J. There are 4 suits, and 4 ranks (A,K,Q,J), so 16 honor cards in total.\\nLet H be the set of A,K,Q,J cards, size 16.\\nWe are told that the hand has exactly 4 cards from H.\\nThe remaining 9 cards are from the 36 non-honor cards (2 through 10, 9 per suit, 4 suits, 36 cards).\\n\\nThe point value is defined as:\\n- A: 4 points\\n- K: 3 points\\n- Q: 2 points\\n- J: 1 point\\n\\nLet the number of A,K,Q,J in the hand be $a,k,q,j$ respectively.\\nWe know $a+k+q+j=4$ (since exactly 4 honor cards).\\nPoints = $4a + 3k + 2q + j$\\nWe want P(points ≥ 13 | exactly 4 honor cards)\\n\\nSince the non-honor cards don't affect the point value, and the condition is only on the honor cards, and the dealing is random, the distribution of which honor cards are in the hand depends only on the combination of honor cards.\\nGiven that there are exactly 4 honor cards in the hand, the types of these 4 cards are equally likely among all ways to choose 4 cards from the 16 honor cards.\\nIs that correct?\\nActually, no: because the cards are dealt randomly, but conditional on having exactly 4 honor cards, the specific 4 honor cards are chosen uniformly at random from all combinations of 4 out of 16, but only if the non-honor cards don't affect the selection, which they do, but since the deck is shuffled randomly, the hand is a random subset of 13 cards.\\nSo, the probability is hypergeometric.\\nSpecifically, the composition of the honor cards in the hand, given that there are exactly 4 honor cards, is equivalent to choosing 4 cards uniformly at random from the 16 honor cards, without regard to the others, because the conditioning is only on the count.\\nMore precisely: the joint distribution of the hand is uniform over all $\\\\binom{52}{13}$ hands.\\nWe condition on the event that exactly 4 of the 13 cards are in the 16 honor cards.\\nThe number of such hands is $\\\\binom{16}{4} \\\\binom{36}{9}$, since choose 4 honors from 16, and 9 non-honors from 36.\\nFor each possible combination of 4 honor cards, the number of hands containing exactly those 4 honors and 9 non-honors is $\\\\binom{36}{9}$, same for all.\\nTherefore, given that there are exactly 4 honor cards, each set of 4 honor cards is equally likely.\\nSo, we can model this as: choose 4 cards uniformly at random from the 16 honor cards, and compute the probability that their point sum is at least 13.\\n\\nNow, the 16 honor cards consist of:\\n- 4 Aces (each 4 points)\\n- 4 Kings (3 points)\\n- 4 Queens (2 points)\\n- 4 Jacks (1 point)\\n\\nWe draw 4 cards at random from these 16, without replacement, and want P(sum ≥ 13)\\n\\nSince the total number is small, we can compute the number of favorable combinations.\\nTotal number of ways to choose 4 cards from 16: $\\\\binom{16}{4}$\\nWe need the sum of points ≥ 13.\\n\\nLet the points be: A:4, K:3, Q:2, J:1\\nLet a,k,q,j be the counts in the 4 cards, with a+k+q+j=4, and 0≤a,k,q,j≤4\\nSum s = 4a+3k+2q+j\\nWe want s≥13\\n\\nSince max is 4*4=16, min is 4*1=4, but we want high end.\\n\\nPossible combinations:\\n\\nMax sum is 16: all 4 Aces. Sum=16≥13: good.\\nNext, 3 Aces and one other.\\nIf 3A and 1K: sum=3*4 +3=12+3=15≥13: good\\n3A and 1Q: 12+2=14≥13: good\\n3A and 1J: 12+1=13≥13: good\\nSo all cases with 3 or 4 Aces are good.\\n\\nNow, 2 Aces: sum from Aces is 8, need additional sum ≥5 from the other 2 cards.\\nOther two cards from K,Q,J: each K:3, Q:2, J:1\\nPossible pairs:\\n- K,K: 3+3=6 ≥5: good\\n- K,Q: 3+2=5≥5: good\\n- K,J: 3+1=4<5: not enough\\n- Q,Q: 2+2=4<5: no\\n- Q,J: 2+1=3<5: no\\n- J,J:1+1=2<5: no\\nSo only KK, KQ are good. Note that KQ is same as QK, but since we care about counts, we need to consider multiplicities.\\n\\nSo for 2 Aces, we need the other two to be: two Kings, or one King and one Queen.\\n\\nNow, 1 Ace: sum from Ace is 4, need sum from other three cards ≥9.\\nEach of the other cards is at most 3 (King), so max sum from three is 9, so need exactly 9, i.e., three Kings.\\nBecause if any is not King, sum ≤ 3+3+2=8<9.\\nSo only possibility: 1A and 3K.\\nSum=4+9=13≥13: good.\\n\\nNow, 0 Aces: sum from Aces is 0, need sum from four cards ≥13.\\nMax per card is 3, so max sum is 12 (four Kings), which is less than 13. So impossible.\\nThus, only possibilities are:\\n- 4 Aces\\n- 3 Aces and one K,Q, or J\\n- 2 Aces and two K, or 2 Aces and one K one Q\\n- 1 Ace and three Kings\\n\\nNow, compute the number of ways for each.\\n\\nFirst, total number of ways: $\\\\binom{16}{4} = \\\\frac{16\\\\times15\\\\times14\\\\times13}{4\\\\times3\\\\times2\\\\times1} = \\\\frac{16\\\\times15\\\\times14\\\\times13}{24}$\\nCalculate: 16/8=2, better: 16×15=240, 240×14=3360, 3360×13=43680, divide by 24: 43680 / 24.\\n24×1800=43200, subtract 43680-43200=480, 24×20=480, so 1820.\\nSo $\\\\binom{16}{4} = 1820$\\n\\nNow, favorable cases:\\n\\n1. 4 Aces: number of ways: $\\\\binom{4}{4} = 1$\\n\\n2. 3 Aces and one other:\\n- Choose 3 Aces: $\\\\binom{4}{3} = 4$\\n- The other card: can be K,Q, or J. There are 4K,4Q,4J, total 12 cards.\\nBut we need to specify: for each type.\\nNumber of ways: $\\\\binom{4}{3} \\\\times \\\\binom{12}{1} = 4 \\\\times 12 = 48$\\nBut is that correct? $\\\\binom{12}{1}=12$, yes, since 12 non-Ace honor cards.\\nBut we can break down: \\n- 3A,1K: $\\\\binom{4}{3}\\\\binom{4}{1} = 4 \\\\times 4 = 16$\\n- 3A,1Q: 4×4=16\\n- 3A,1J:4×4=16\\nTotal: 16+16+16=48, yes.\\nAll these have sum ≥13, as computed.\\n\\n3. 2 Aces and two Kings: $\\\\binom{4}{2} \\\\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\\\times 6 = 36$\\nSum=2*4 + 2*3=8+6=14≥13: good.\\n\\n4. 2 Aces and one King and one Queen: $\\\\binom{4}{2} \\\\binom{4}{1} \\\\binom{4}{1} = 6 \\\\times 4 \\\\times 4 = 96$\\nSum=8+3+2=13≥13: good.\\n\\n5. 1 Ace and three Kings: $\\\\binom{4}{1} \\\\binom{4}{3} = 4 \\\\times 4 = 16$\\nSum=4+9=13≥13: good.\\n\\nNow, are there any others? Earlier we had 2 Aces and two Kings, and 2A,1K,1Q, but not 2A and two Queens? But that would be sum=8+4=12<13, not included. Similarly, 2A and K and J: 8+3+1=12<13, not included.\\nAnd 1A with two K and one Q: sum=4+6+2=12<13, not enough, and we already said only three Kings work.\\n\\nSo total favorable = \\n- 4A: 1\\n- 3A + one other: 48\\n- 2A + 2K: 36\\n- 2A + 1K + 1Q: 96\\n- 1A + 3K: 16\\nSum: 1 + 48 = 49; 49 + 36 = 85; 85 + 96 = 181; 181 + 16 = 197\\n\\nTotal possible: 1820\\nSo probability = 197 / 1820\\n\\nNow, simplify this fraction.\\nFind gcd of 197 and 1820.\\nFirst, 197 is a prime number? Check: divisible by primes less than sqrt(197)≈14.03: 2,3,5,7,11,13.\\n197 even? no. Sum digits 1+9+7=17 not div by 3. Ends with 7, not 0 or 5, so not div by 5. 7*28=196, 197-196=1, not div by 7. 11: 1-9+7=-1 not div by 11. 13*15=195, 197-195=2, not div. So 197 is prime.\\nNow, 1820 div by 197? 197*9=1773, 1820-1773=47, not zero. 197*10=1970>1820. So not divisible. Thus gcd is 1.\\nSo fraction is already reduced: 197/1820\\n\\nBut is that correct? Total favorable 197, total 1820.\\nBut let me double-check the counts.\\n\\n4A: $\\\\binom{4}{4}=1$: ok\\n3A and one other: $\\\\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways to choose Aces, and 12 choices for the other card (since 16-4=12 non-Ace honor cards), so 4*12=48: ok\\n2A and 2K: $\\\\binom{4}{2}=6$ for Aces, $\\\\binom{4}{2}=6$ for Kings, so 36: ok\\n2A and 1K and 1Q: $\\\\binom{4}{2}=6$ for Aces, $\\\\binom{4}{1}=4$ for Kings, $\\\\binom{4}{1}=4$ for Queens, so 6*4*4=96: ok\\n1A and 3K: $\\\\binom{4}{1}=4$ for Ace, $\\\\binom{4}{3}=4$ for Kings, so 16: ok\\nSum: 1+48=49, 49+36=85, 85+96=181, 181+16=197: yes\\n\\nTotal: $\\\\binom{16}{4}=1820$: standard value, yes.\\n\\nBut is there any overlap? No, because different compositions.\\n\\nNow, but wait: in the 2A and 1K and 1Q, we have specified the counts, and since we are choosing specific cards, and no overlap with others, yes.\\n\\nSo probability is 197/1820.\\n\\nBut the problem asks for the probability, and to box it, but in the context, probably just the fraction.\\n\\nBut let me confirm if we missed any case.\\nWhat about 4 Kings? Sum=12<13, not included, correct.\\n3 Kings and one Queen: sum=9+2=11<13, no.\\nTwo Aces and two Queens: 8+4=12<13, no.\\nThree Aces and one Ace? No.\\nOr 1 Ace, 2 Kings, 1 Queen: sum=4+6+2=12<13, not enough.\\n1 Ace, 1 King, 2 Queens: 4+3+4=11<13.\\nNo.\\nFour Aces already included.\\nWhat about 3 Kings and 1 Ace? That's the same as 1A and 3K, already included.\\nOr 2 Kings and 2 Aces, included.\\nSo I think all covered.\\n\\nThus, probability is $\\\\frac{197}{1820}$\\n\\nBut the problem says \"find the probability\", and in the first problem it was a fraction a/b, but here it doesn't specify, but since it's a probability, we leave it as fraction.\\n\\nBut in the answer, for Problem 1 we computed 100a+b, but for Problem 2, it just says find the probability, so probably just the fraction.\\n\\nLooking back: \\\"compute 100a+b\\\" only for Problem 1. For Problem 2, just the probability.\\n\\nSo answer for Problem 2 is $\\\\frac{197}{1820}$\\n\\nBut let me write it as simplified fraction, which it is.\\n\\nSo final answers:\\nProblem 1: 820\\nProblem 2: 197/1820\\n\\nBut in the JSON, we need to put the values as strings.\\n\\nFor Problem 1, answer_1 should be \"820\"\\nFor Problem 2, answer_2 should be \"197/1820\"\\n\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"820\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"197/1820\"\n}",
