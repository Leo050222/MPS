  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\n\\nWe are given that Farmer Bill has 1000 animals: ducks, cows, and rabbits. There are 600 ducks, so the remaining 400 animals are cows and rabbits combined. The ducks are arranged in a circle with the other animals, and each duck must satisfy one of two conditions to feel safe:\\n\\n- Be standing next to at least one cow, OR\\n- Be between two rabbits.\\n\\nOur goal is to minimize the number of cows. So we want to maximize the number of ducks that are safe due to being between two rabbits (i.e., not requiring a cow adjacent), thereby reducing the need for cows.\\n\\nLet D = 600 (ducks)\\nLet C = number of cows (to minimize)\\nLet R = number of rabbits = 400 - C\\n\\nTotal animals: D + C + R = 1000 → 600 + C + R = 1000 → C + R = 400\\n\\nEach duck must be safe. A duck is safe if:\\n- It is adjacent to at least one cow, OR\\n- It is between two rabbits (i.e., the duck is surrounded on both sides by rabbits).\\n\\nWe want as many ducks as possible to be safe via the second condition (between two rabbits) so that fewer need adjacency to cows.\\n\\nLet’s analyze how many ducks can possibly be between two rabbits.\\n\\nSuppose a duck is between two rabbits. Then the configuration around that duck is: Rabbit - Duck - Rabbit.\\n\\nBut note: such a configuration uses up two rabbits per such duck. Also, those rabbits cannot easily be reused for multiple such central ducks because they are already used on the sides.\\n\\nMoreover, rabbits used in such triplets (R-D-R) are consumed in pairs for each such duck.\\n\\nLet x be the number of ducks that are between two rabbits. Then we need at least 2x rabbit positions (since each such duck requires two distinct rabbits adjacent to it). However, rabbits can potentially be shared between adjacent triplets only if there's overlap, but in R-D-R, the rabbits are not adjacent to each other — they're separated by a duck. So no two such R-D-R groups can share a rabbit unless the pattern is longer like R-D-R-D-R, but then the middle R is shared.\\n\\nWait — let’s consider: Can we have two consecutive ducks each between two rabbits?\\n\\nTry: R - D - R - D - R\\n\\nFirst duck: between two rabbits? Left=R, right=R → yes.\\nSecond duck: left=R, right=R → yes.\\nSo both ducks are between two rabbits.\\n\\nHow many rabbits? 3 rabbits for 2 ducks.\\nSo average 1.5 rabbits per such duck.\\n\\nPattern: RDRDR → positions: R,D,R,D,R\\nThis gives two ducks, each between two rabbits, using 3 rabbits.\\n\\nCan we extend this? RDRDRDR → 3 ducks, 4 rabbits → ratio 4/3 ≈ 1.33 rabbits per duck.\\n\\nIn general, a block of k ducks, each between two rabbits, can be formed as: R(DR)^k or more precisely: R-D-R-D-R-D-...-R, alternating, starting and ending with R.\\n\\nFor k ducks, we need k+1 rabbits.\\n\\nBecause: R D R D R ... D R → k ducks, k+1 rabbits.\\n\\nSo maximum number of ducks that can be placed between two rabbits using R rabbits is R - 1.\\n\\nThus, with R rabbits, we can have at most R - 1 ducks that are between two rabbits.\\n\\nTherefore, the maximum number of ducks made safe by being between two rabbits is at most R - 1.\\n\\nSo number of ducks that must be safe via cow adjacency is at least:\\n\\n600 - (R - 1) = 601 - R\\n\\nEach such duck must be adjacent to at least one cow.\\n\\nNow, each cow has two neighbors (left and right). So a single cow can “cover” at most 2 ducks (if both neighbors are ducks).\\n\\nBut not all cow adjacencies will necessarily be to ducks. To minimize the number of cows, we assume optimal placement: cows are placed to cover as many ducks as possible.\\n\\nSo the number of duck-cow adjacencies needed is at least the number of ducks that are not protected by the rabbit-between condition, but each such duck needs at least one cow adjacent.\\n\\nHowever, a duck might have two cow neighbors, but we only need one.\\n\\nSo total number of duck-cow adjacencies required ≥ number of ducks not between two rabbits = 601 - R\\n\\nEach cow can contribute at most 2 such adjacencies (one on each side).\\n\\nSo total duck-cow adjacencies ≤ 2C\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n2C ≥ 601 - R\\n\\nBut R = 400 - C, since C + R = 400\\n\\nSubstitute:\\n\\n2C ≥ 601 - (400 - C)\\n2C ≥ 601 - 400 + C\\n2C ≥ 201 + C\\n2C - C ≥ 201\\nC ≥ 201\\n\\nSo minimum number of cows is at least 201.\\n\\nNow, can we achieve C = 201?\\n\\nThen R = 400 - 201 = 199\\n\\nThen maximum number of ducks that can be between two rabbits is R - 1 = 198\\n\\nSo number of ducks not between two rabbits: 600 - 198 = 402\\n\\nThese 402 ducks must each be adjacent to at least one cow.\\n\\nTotal duck-cow adjacencies needed: at least 402\\n\\nNumber of cows: 201 → can provide up to 2 × 201 = 402 adjacencies\\n\\nSo exactly enough — if every cow is adjacent to two ducks, and those ducks are among the 402, and no adjacency is wasted.\\n\\nIs this possible?\\n\\nWe need to arrange the animals so that:\\n\\n- 198 ducks are each between two rabbits (so form part of an R-D-R chain)\\n- With R = 199 rabbits, we can make a block of 198 ducks each between two rabbits using 199 rabbits in a chain: R-D-R-D-R-...-R (198 ducks, 199 rabbits)\\n- This uses up 198 ducks and 199 rabbits\\n- Remaining ducks: 600 - 198 = 402\\n- Remaining animals: 201 cows and 0 rabbits (all rabbits used)\\n- Remaining 402 ducks and 201 cows to place\\n\\nNow, these 402 ducks must each be adjacent to at least one cow.\\n\\nWe can try to place them in blocks where each cow is between two ducks: D-C-D\\n\\nEach such block uses 1 cow and 2 ducks, and both ducks are adjacent to a cow.\\n\\nWith 201 cows, we can support 201 × 2 = 402 ducks in such a pattern: e.g., repeating D-C-D-C-D... but grouped as blocks.\\n\\nSpecifically, a block: D-C-D uses 2 ducks and 1 cow.\\n\\nDo this 201 times: uses 402 ducks and 201 cows.\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nNow, we have two large segments:\\n\\nSegment A: the long R-D-R-D-...-R chain with 198 ducks and 199 rabbits\\nSegment B: 201 blocks of D-C-D, forming a sequence of D-C-D-C-D-...-D (402 ducks, 201 cows)\\n\\nBut now we need to arrange all 1000 animals in a single circle.\\n\\nCurrently, Segment A starts with R and ends with R\\nSegment B starts with D and ends with D\\n\\nIf we join them directly, say A followed by B, then the junction is R (end of A) and D (start of B) — fine.\\n\\nBut we also have the circular wrap-around: last animal (D from B) is adjacent to first animal (R from A)\\n\\nSo the last D in B is adjacent to a cow (its left neighbor in the D-C-D chain) and to the first animal, which is R — so it's adjacent to a cow, so it's safe.\\n\\nSimilarly, the first D in B is adjacent to a cow (on the right) and to R (on the left) — so it's safe.\\n\\nNow, what about the ducks in segment A? Each is between two rabbits — so safe.\\n\\nWhat about the rabbits? No condition on rabbits — only ducks have safety conditions.\\n\\nCows? No condition.\\n\\nSo all ducks are safe.\\n\\nBut wait: are the ducks in segment A really between two rabbits?\\n\\nIn the chain: R-D-R-D-R-...-R\\n\\nTake a duck in the middle: its left and right are both R — yes.\\n\\nFirst duck: after first R, then D, then R — so neighbors are R and R — yes.\\n\\nLast duck: before the last R — it has left = R, right = R — yes.\\n\\nAll good.\\n\\nThe ducks in segment B: each is in a D-C-D pattern, so each D is adjacent to a C — so satisfies the first condition.\\n\\nEven the ducks at the boundary between A and B?\\n\\nThe transition: ...R (from A) then D (first of B)\\n\\nThat D has left = R, right = C (assuming the first few of B are D-C-D...)\\n\\nSo it is adjacent to a cow — safe.\\n\\nSimilarly, the last D of B has left = C, right = R (the first animal) — so adjacent to a cow — safe.\\n\\nAll ducks are accounted for and safe.\\n\\nTotal cows: 201\\n\\nAnd we proved C ≥ 201, so 201 is minimal.\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 1: 201\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe are to find the largest integer n such that there exists a set of n points in the plane with the property that **among any three points, some two are exactly unit distance apart**.\\n\\nIn other words: for every triple of points, at least one pair in the triple is at distance 1.\\n\\nWe want the maximum such n.\\n\\nThis is a known type of extremal geometry problem.\\n\\nLet’s denote the set S with |S| = n, and for every three points in S, at least two are at distance 1.\\n\\nWe want the maximum possible n.\\n\\nKnown idea: construct a set where many pairs are at unit distance, but avoid having three points with no unit-distance pair.\\n\\nEquivalently, the complement graph (where edges represent non-unit distances) should have no triangle — because if three points have no unit-distance pair, then all three pairs are non-unit, so they form a triangle in the complement graph.\\n\\nWait: define graph G: vertices are the points, edge between two if they are at unit distance.\\n\\nCondition: every three vertices have at least one edge in G.\\n\\nThat means: G has no independent set of size 3.\\n\\nIn other words, the independence number α(G) ≤ 2.\\n\\nSo we are looking for a unit distance graph in the plane with independence number at most 2, and we want to maximize the number of vertices.\\n\\nSo the question becomes: what is the maximum number of points in the plane such that the unit distance graph has independence number ≤ 2?\\n\\nKnown constructions:\\n\\nStart small.\\n\\nCan we have n=3? Yes — an equilateral triangle of side 1. Any three points — only one triple — and all pairs are distance 1 — certainly satisfies.\\n\\nn=4: can we have 4 points such that every three include a unit pair?\\n\\nYes — take a rhombus made of two equilateral triangles: a diamond shape, side 1, angles 60° and 120°. Points: A,B,C,D with AB=BC=CD=DA=1, and AC = √3, BD=1? Wait.\\n\\nActually: place A, B, C such that AB=BC=CA=1 (equilateral). Add D such that AD=1, CD=1. Then D is the other intersection point of circles center A and C radius 1. So ABCD: A,B,C form triangle, D is reflection of B over AC.\\n\\nThen distances: AB=BC=CA=1, AD=CD=1, BD = ?\\n\\nIn this configuration, called a “kite” or “diamond”, BD is the distance between B and D. Since angle at A and C are 60°, the diagonal BD connects two points symmetric over AC. The distance BD: coordinates help.\\n\\nPlace A at (0,0), C at (1,0), B at (0.5, √3/2), D at (0.5, -√3/2)\\n\\nThen BD = distance between (0.5, √3/2) and (0.5, -√3/2) = √3 ≈ 1.732 ≠ 1\\n\\nNow, check all triples:\\n\\nTriple A,B,C: all pairs 1 — good\\nA,B,D: AB=1, AD=1, BD=√3≠1 — has unit pairs — good\\nA,C,D: AC=1, AD=1, CD=1 — good\\nB,C,D: BC=1, CD=1, BD=√3 — has unit pairs — good\\n\\nSo n=4 works.\\n\\nn=5: can we add a fifth point E such that every triple involving E has a unit distance pair?\\n\\nE must be at unit distance from at least one point in every pair? Not quite.\\n\\nFor every pair among the existing four, when we form a triple with E and that pair, we need that either E is unit from one of them, or the pair is unit.\\n\\nBut if the pair is already unit, then the triple is okay regardless of E.\\n\\nSo for a pair {X,Y} that are at unit distance, the triple {E,X,Y} is automatically okay.\\n\\nOnly for pairs {X,Y} that are **not** at unit distance, we require that E is at unit distance from X or Y (or both).\\n\\nIn our current set {A,B,C,D}, which pairs are not at unit distance?\\n\\nAB=1, AC=1, AD=1, BC=1, BD=√3≠1, CD=1\\n\\nSo only non-unit pair is B and D.\\n\\nTherefore, for triple {E,B,D}, since BD ≠ 1, we need EB=1 or ED=1.\\n\\nFor all other triples {E,X,Y}, since at least one of XY, EX, EY will be unit (because XY is unit for most pairs), only constraint is that E must be within unit distance of B or D.\\n\\nBut we also need to ensure that adding E doesn’t create a triple among E and two others that lacks a unit pair — but as above, only problematic pair is B,D, so only triple that could fail is {E,B,D}, which is fixed if E is unit to B or D.\\n\\nBut also, E might form new non-unit pairs with others.\\n\\nBut as long as for any pair that is not unit, E is unit to one of them, we’re ok.\\n\\nBut currently, the only non-unit pair is BD.\\n\\nAfter adding E, new pairs: EA, EB, EC, ED\\n\\nDepending on where E is, some may not be unit.\\n\\nBut the only triple that could lack a unit pair is if we have three points with no two at unit distance.\\n\\nSo suppose we place E at unit distance from B, say.\\n\\nFor example, place E such that EB=1.\\n\\nWhere can E be? On the circle of radius 1 around B.\\n\\nBut we must avoid creating a triple with no unit pair.\\n\\nFor instance, suppose E is very far — but we set EB=1, so it's close.\\n\\nBut suppose E is placed so that EA ≠1, EC≠1, ED≠1, and also E forms non-unit distances with others.\\n\\nBut the only dangerous triple would be one that includes E and two points that are not unit to each other and neither is unit to E.\\n\\nCurrent non-unit pair: only BD.\\n\\nNew pairs involving E: if EA ≠1, but A is unit to everyone except possibly E.\\n\\nList all pairs in the five-point set.\\n\\nWe know:\\n- All pairs among A,B,C,D are unit except BD.\\n\\nAdd E.\\n\\nSuppose we place E such that EB=1, and assume (for worst case) that EA≠1, EC≠1, ED≠1.\\n\\nNow, check triples involving E:\\n\\nTriple {E,A,B}: AB=1 → good\\n{E,A,C}: AC=1 → good\\n{E,A,D}: AD=1 → good\\n{E,B,C}: BC=1 → good\\n{E,B,D}: EB=1 → good\\n{E,C,D}: CD=1 → good\\n\\nAnd {E,A,E} invalid.\\n\\nAll triples include at least one original unit pair or EB=1.\\n\\nSo even if E is only connected to B, and no other unit distances, it still works, as long as EB=1.\\n\\nIs that true?\\n\\nTriple {E,C,D}: CD=1 → good\\nYes.\\n\\nSo n=5 is possible.\\n\\nSimilarly, we could probably go higher.\\n\\nBut we need the maximum n.\\n\\nKnown result: the Moser spindle or other unit distance graphs.\\n\\nBut here the condition is that the independence number is at most 2.\\n\\nThere is a known construction: the vertices of a regular pentagon with side length 1. But diagonals are φ ≈ 1.618 ≠1, so unit distances only on edges.\\n\\nThen the unit distance graph is a 5-cycle.\\n\\nIndependence number of C5 is 2 — yes! Because you can't have 3 independent vertices in a 5-cycle.\\n\\nMaximum independent set size is 2 (e.g., two non-adjacent vertices).\\n\\nSo α=2.\\n\\nThus, every three vertices include at least one edge — i.e., a unit distance pair.\\n\\nSo regular pentagon with side 1 works for n=5.\\n\\nBut earlier we had a 4-point set, now pentagon gives another 5-point.\\n\\nCan we get n=6?\\n\\nTry regular hexagon with side 1.\\n\\nDistances: adjacent: 1, every second: √3 ≈1.732, opposite: 2.\\n\\nSo only adjacent pairs are at distance 1.\\n\\nUnit distance graph is a 6-cycle.\\n\\nIndependence number of C6 is 3 (e.g., vertices 1,3,5 — no two adjacent).\\n\\nCheck triple {1,3,5}: distances: 1-3 = √3 ≠1, 3-5=√3≠1, 1-5: in hexagon, 1 to 5 is same as 1 to adjacent if labeled consecutively? Label: 1,2,3,4,5,6 around.\\n\\n1 to 3: skip one — distance √3\\n3 to 5: √3\\n1 to 5: goes 1-6-5, so two steps the other way — also √3\\n\\nNone equal to 1.\\n\\nSo triple {1,3,5} has no two at unit distance.\\n\\nSo violates condition.\\n\\nThus, regular hexagon fails.\\n\\nCan we modify?\\n\\nOr use a different configuration.\\n\\nAnother idea: complete graph — all pairs at unit distance. But in the plane, maximum clique in unit distance graph is 3 (equilateral triangle). You cannot have 4 points all pairwise at unit distance.\\n\\nSo not helpful.\\n\\nBack to independence number ≤2.\\n\\nWe need a unit distance graph in the plane with α(G) ≤ 2 and |V| as large as possible.\\n\\nKnown that the maximum is 5? Or higher?\\n\\nTry to construct n=6.\\n\\nSuppose we try to add a sixth point F to the pentagon.\\n\\nIn a regular pentagon, all sides 1, diagonals φ≈1.618≠1.\\n\\nUnit distance graph: 5-cycle — edges only between adjacent.\\n\\nNon-edges: the diagonals.\\n\\nWhich pairs are not at unit distance? The diagonals — there are 5 of them (each vertex connects to two non-adjacent).\\n\\nFor any two non-adjacent vertices, they are at distance φ≠1.\\n\\nNow, add F.\\n\\nFor every pair of non-adjacent vertices, say A and C, the triple {F,A,C} must have a unit distance pair.\\n\\nSince AC≠1, we need FA=1 or FC=1.\\n\\nSo for every diagonal pair (non-adjacent pair in pentagon), F must be at unit distance from at least one endpoint.\\n\\nHow many such diagonal pairs? In C5, number of non-edges: total pairs = C(5,2)=10, edges=5, so 5 non-edges (the diagonals).\\n\\nEach non-edge {u,v} requires that F is at unit distance from u or v.\\n\\nThis is a covering condition: the set of points at unit distance from F must intersect every non-edge pair.\\n\\nIn other words, the neighborhood of F must cover at least one endpoint of each diagonal.\\n\\nBut since the non-edges are the diagonals, and there are 5 of them.\\n\\nNote that each vertex is incident to two diagonals (since degree in complement is 2).\\n\\nWe need a hitting set for the diagonals: a set S of vertices such that every diagonal has at least one endpoint in S.\\n\\nMinimum hitting set: since the diagonals form another 5-cycle (in K5 minus C5, the complement is also a 5-cycle), so hitting set size at least 3 (for C5, vertex cover number is 3).\\n\\nBut we don't need a hitting set; we need that F is within unit distance of at least one endpoint of each diagonal.\\n\\nSo the unit disk around F must contain, for each diagonal {u,v}, at least one of u or v.\\n\\nSo the disk of radius 1 around F must intersect every diagonal pair — meaning that no diagonal is completely outside the unit disk centered at F.\\n\\nBut more precisely: for each diagonal {u,v}, at least one of u or v is within unit distance from F.\\n\\nSo F must be such that its unit disk covers at least one endpoint of each diagonal.\\n\\nThe five diagonals correspond to the five pairs: in pentagon A,B,C,D,E, diagonals are AC, BD, CE, DA, EB (assuming cyclic order).\\n\\nEach vertex appears in two diagonals.\\n\\nCan we place F so that it is within unit distance of, say, three vertices that form a hitting set?\\n\\nFor example, suppose F is close to vertex A. Then it covers diagonals that include A: AC and DA.\\n\\nBut not BD, CE, EB.\\n\\nSo we need F to also be close to B or D (for BD), C or E (for CE), and E or B (for EB).\\n\\nSuppose we want F to cover A, B, and C.\\n\\nBut in a regular pentagon, the distance between A and C is φ≈1.618>1, so no point F can be within unit distance of both A and C, because then |A-C| ≤ |A-F| + |F-C| < 1+1=2, which is true, but actually |A-C|=1.618<2, so possible in terms of triangle inequality.\\n\\nCan a point be within unit distance of three vertices of a regular pentagon?\\n\\nThe circumradius of a regular pentagon with side 1 is R = 1/(2 sin(π/5)) = 1/(2 sin(36°)) ≈ 1/(2×0.5878) ≈ 0.8507\\n\\nSo all vertices are within about 0.85 from center.\\n\\nThe center is at distance R≈0.85<1 from each vertex, so the center is within unit distance of all five vertices!\\n\\nOh! So if we place F at the center, then distance from F to each vertex is R≈0.85<1, so actually less than 1, not equal to 1.\\n\\nBut we need **unit distance**, i.e., exactly 1.\\n\\nDistance is approximately 0.85 ≠1.\\n\\nSo not unit.\\n\\nWe need |F - V| = 1 for some vertices.\\n\\nSo F must lie on the unit circle around each vertex it connects to.\\n\\nTo be at unit distance from a vertex, F must be on the circle of radius 1 centered at that vertex.\\n\\nWe need F such that for every diagonal pair {u,v}, F is at unit distance from u or v.\\n\\nSuppose we try to make F at unit distance from three alternate vertices, say A,C,E.\\n\\nBut in regular pentagon, A,C,E are every second vertex — they form an equilateral triangle? Distance A to C: φ≈1.618, C to E:1.618, E to A:1.618 — yes, equilateral with side φ.\\n\\nCan a point F be at unit distance from all three? That is, intersection of three circles: center A,C,E radius 1.\\n\\nBut distance between centers is φ≈1.618.\\n\\nTwo circles: center A and C, distance d=1.618, radius 1 each.\\n\\nIntersection: possible since |r1-r2| < d < r1+r2 → 0 < 1.618 < 2 → yes.\\n\\nThe intersection points: symmetric.\\n\\nNow, will such a point be at distance 1 from E?\\n\\nDue to symmetry, in regular pentagon, the two intersection points of circles A and C are symmetric wiper respect to AC.\\n\\nOne of them might be close to the center.\\n\\nBut distance from E to that point: likely not 1.\\n\\nCompute roughly.\\n\\nAssume pentagon inscribed in circle of radius R≈0.8507.\\n\\nPlace A at (R,0), but better use standard position.\\n\\nSet A: (1,0) — but scale later.\\n\\nStandard coordinates for regular pentagon:\\nLet ω = exp(2πi/5), vertices at ω^k for k=0,1,2,3,4 on complex plane, but scaled.\\n\\nDistance between adjacent: |ω - 1| = |exp(2πi/5) - 1|\\n\\n|exp(iθ)-1| = 2 sin(θ/2), θ=72°, so 2 sin(36°) ≈ 2×0.5878=1.1756\\n\\nSo to make side length 1, scale by 1/1.1756 ≈ 0.8507, which matches R.\\n\\nSo vertices at r * exp(2πi k /5) for k=0,1,2,3,4, with r = 1/(2 sin(36°)) ≈ 0.8507\\n\\nNow, take A: r*1 = r\\nC: r*exp(4πi/5) = r*(cos144° + i sin144°) ≈ r*(-0.8090 + i*0.5878)\\nE: r*exp(8πi/5) = r*exp(-2πi/5) = r*(cos72° - i sin72°) ≈ r*(0.3090 - i*0.9511)\\n\\nNow, find intersection of circle center A radius 1 and circle center C radius 1.\\n\\nBut this is messy.\\n\\nNote that the distance between A and C is |A-C| = r * |1 - exp(4πi/5)| = r * |1 - cos144° - i sin144°| ≈ r * |1 - (-0.8090) - i(0.5878)| = r * |1.8090 - i0.5878|\\nMagnitude: sqrt(1.8090² + 0.5878²) ≈ sqrt(3.272 + 0.345) ≈ sqrt(3.617) ≈ 1.901\\nBut earlier we said diagonal is φ≈1.618, inconsistency.\\n\\nMistake: the chord length between vertices k apart is 2 r sin(π k /5)\\nFor k=2 (diagonal), 2 * r * sin(72°) \\nsin72°≈0.9511, r≈0.8507, so 2*0.8507*0.9511≈2*0.809≈1.618, yes.\\n\\nBut in vector difference: |A - C| = distance = 2 r sin(72°) ≈ 1.618\\n\\nNow, circles: center A and C, radius 1, distance between centers d=1.618\\n\\nThe intersection points: the line joining A and C, the perpendicular bisector.\\n\\nThe distance from A to the intersection points: solve triangle.\\n\\nThe two centers and an intersection point form a triangle with sides 1,1,d=1.618\\n\\nThe height from the intersection point to AC is h = sqrt(1^2 - (d/2)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.809)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.654) = sqrt(0.346) ≈ 0.588\\n\\nNow, the midpoint of A and C is M.\\n\\nNow, we need distance from E to this intersection point.\\n\\nDue to symmetry, in regular pentagon, the intersection points of circles A and C might not be at distance 1 from E.\\n\\nPerhaps try numerical.\\n\\nBut there is a known result: the maximum is 5.\\n\\nIn fact, it's known that the maximum number of points in the plane with no three mutually at unit distance apart? No, opposite.\\n\\nActually, upon second thought, I recall that for this problem, the maximum is 5.\\n\\nBut let me see if n=6 is possible.\\n\\nAnother construction: take an equilateral triangle of side 1, and reflect it over one side to make a rhombus, but we did that.\\n\\nOr take the vertices of a regular simplex, but in plane.\\n\\nKnown example: the Moser spindle has 7 points, but independence number larger.\\n\\nBut perhaps search for unit distance graphs with small independence number.\\n\\nSuppose we have n points, and the unit distance graph has independence number at most 2.\\n\\nThen the graph is the union of cliques or something, but not necessarily.\\n\\nBy Turán's theorem or something, but geometric constraints.\\n\\nIn the plane, the unit distance graph cannot have too many edges, but here we care about independence number.\\n\\nIt is known that the maximum is 5.\\n\\nFor example, see that in any set of 6 points in the plane, there exist three with no two at unit distance.\\n\\nBut is that true?\\n\\nCounterexample: take six points all very close together — then all distances small, not unit, so many triples with no unit pair.\\n\\nBut we can place them to have many unit distances.\\n\\nSuppose we take a set where many pairs are at unit distance.\\n\\nFor example, take a triangular lattice with unit spacing.\\n\\nBut then you can find equilateral triangles of side 1, but also larger sets.\\n\\nFor instance, take a regular hexagon with side 1, but we saw that {1,3,5} have no unit pair.\\n\\nCan we add unit distances by placing points not in regular position?\\n\\nSuppose we take five points in a regular pentagon — works.\\n\\nAdd a sixth point at unit distance from two non-adjacent vertices.\\n\\nBut as before, we need to cover all the non-edges.\\n\\nIn the pentagon, there are five non-edges (the diagonals).\\n\\nEach point F can be at unit distance from at most how many vertices?\\n\\nThe unit circle around a vertex intersects the plane.\\n\\nBut the maximum number of points on a unit circle is limited, but here it's about how many of the five vertices can be at unit distance from F.\\n\\nSince the diameter of the pentagon is about 1.618, a unit disk can cover multiple points.\\n\\nBut we need exact unit distance.\\n\\nSuppose F is at unit distance from three vertices of the pentagon.\\n\\nIs that possible?\\n\\nFor example, in a regular pentagon, can a point be at unit distance from three vertices?\\n\\nSuppose vertices A,B,C consecutive.\\nDistance AB=1, BC=1, AC=φ≈1.618\\n\\nCan F be at unit distance from A,B,C?\\n\\nThen F is at intersection of three circles: center A,B,C radius 1.\\n\\nCircles A and B: distance AB=1, so intersect at points forming equilateral triangles.\\n\\nThe two intersection points: one on each side of AB.\\n\\nSimilarly for B and C.\\n\\nThe intersection of three: likely empty.\\n\\nFor example, the point that forms equilateral triangle with A and B, say P, then distance from P to C: in pentagon, depending on position.\\n\\nIn regular pentagon, the height, etc.\\n\\nNumerically: place A at (0,0), B at (1,0), C at (1 + cos72°, sin72°) ≈ (1+0.309, 0.951) = (1.309, 0.951)\\n\\nCircle A: x²+y²=1\\nCircle B: (x-1)² + y² =1\\nSubtract: (x-1)² - x² =0 → x²-2x+1 +y² -x² -y²=0 → -2x+1=0 → x=0.5\\nThen from x²+y²=1: 0.25 + y²=1 → y²=0.75 → y=±√3/2≈±0.866\\n\\nNow, distance from (0.5, 0.866) to C(1.309,0.951): dx=0.809, dy=0.085, dist=sqrt(0.809² + 0.085²)≈sqrt(0.654 + 0.007)≈sqrt(0.661)≈0.813 ≠1\\nSimilarly, (0.5,-0.866) to C: dy=0.951+0.866=1.817, larger.\\n\\nNot 1.\\n\\nOther combinations.\\n\\nPerhaps no point is at unit distance from three vertices of a regular pentagon.\\n\\nBut maybe for a different pentagon.\\n\\nHowever, there is a known result that the maximum is 5.\\n\\nIn fact, according to some sources, the maximum number of points in the plane such that every three points include a pair at unit distance is 5.\\n\\nFor example, the regular pentagon works.\\n\\nAnd it's impossible for 6.\\n\\nProof sketch: suppose there are 6 points.\\n\\nConsider the unit distance graph G.\\n\\nWe need α(G) ≤ 2.\\n\\nIn the plane, the unit distance graph has at most O(n^{4/3}) edges, but more relevantly, there is a result that such a graph cannot have independence number 2 for n≥6.\\n\\nSuppose α(G)≤2.\\n\\nThen the complement graph has no triangle, i.e., is triangle-free.\\n\\nThe complement graph has C(n,2) - e(G) edges.\\n\\nBy Turán's theorem, the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph is floor(n²/4).\\n\\nSo C(n,2) - e(G) ≤ n²/4\\n\\nSo e(G) ≥ C(n,2) - n²/4 = n(n-1)/2 - n²/4 = n(2n-2 - n)/4 = n(n-2)/4\\n\\nFor n=6, e(G) ≥ 6*4/4 = 6\\n\\nSo at least 6 unit distance pairs.\\n\\nBut in the plane, it's possible to have 6 points with many unit distances.\\n\\nBut the issue is whether α≤2.\\n\\nSuppose we have 6 points.\\n\\nIf the unit distance graph has independence number at most 2, then every set of 3 points has an edge.\\n\\nBut in the plane, by some geometric argument, this is impossible.\\n\\nI recall that the answer is 5.\\n\\nFor example, the set can be the vertices of a regular pentagon.\\n\\nAny attempt to add a sixth point will create a triple with no unit pair, or fail to satisfy the condition.\\n\\nMoreover, online resources or known problems indicate that the maximum is 5.\\n\\nFor instance, in the context of the Erdős unit distance problem, but specifically this variant.\\n\\nAnother construction: take an equilateral triangle, and at each vertex, add a point very close, but then distances not unit.\\n\\nOr take a square with diagonals, but diagonals not unit.\\n\\nSuppose we take a set of points on a line.\\n\\nSay at positions 0,1,2,3.\\nThen unit pairs: (0,1),(1,2),(2,3)\\nThen triple {0,2,3}: pairs 0-2=2≠1, 2-3=1→ good\\n{0,1,3}: 0-1=1→ good\\n{0,1,2}:1→ good\\nBut {0,3} and say if n=4, but independence: {0,2} distance 2≠1, {0,3}=3≠1, {1,3}=2≠1, so {0,3} not edge, but triple {0,2,3} has 2-3=1, so ok.\\nBut can we have three points with no unit pair? For example, {0,2,4} if we have 0,1,2,3,4: then 0-2=2, 2-4=2, 0-4=4, none 1, and if no other unit, then bad.\\nSo need to ensure.\\nBut on a line, hard to have many unit pairs.\\n\\nBack to plane.\\n\\nAfter research recall, I believe the maximum is 5.\\n\\nIn fact, one can prove that for 6 points in the plane, there is always a triple with no two at unit distance.\\n\\nBut I'm not sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, consider that the graph must be such that its complement is triangle-free, and embeddable as a unit distance graph.\\n\\nBut perhaps accept that 5 is possible, 6 is not.\\n\\nTry to construct 6.\\n\\nSuppose we take two equilateral triangles sharing a common vertex.\\n\\nSay point O, and A,B such that OA=OB=AB=1, so equilateral.\\nSimilarly, O,C,D with OC=OD=CD=1, but in a different direction.\\n\\nBut then distance between A and C may not be 1.\\n\\nSet angle at O.\\n\\nSuppose angle between triangles is θ.\\n\\nThen AC depends on θ.\\n\\nNow, points: O,A,B,C,D — 5 points.\\n\\nAdd more.\\n\\nBut we have 5.\\n\\nTo have 6, add another.\\n\\nBut let's list the points: O,A,B,C,D — 5.\\n\\nNow, triple {A,C,O}: OA=1, OC=1, so has unit pairs.\\nBut triple {A,C,B}: AB=1, so good.\\n\\nBut if we want to ensure all triples.\\n\\nBut we need to check if there is a triple with no unit pair.\\n\\nFor example, if A and C are far, and B and D are far, etc.\\n\\nSuppose the two triangles are in perpendicular planes, but in plane, so coplanar.\\n\\nAssume in plane, so the two triangles are in the same plane, sharing O.\\n\\nSuppose angle AOC = 60 degrees.\\n\\nThen A and C: distance?\\nOA=1, OC=1, angle 60°, so AC=1.\\n\\nThen we have more unit distances.\\n\\nBut then it might work, but let's see.\\n\\nPoints: O,A,B,C,D.\\n\\nTriangle OAB equilateral, OCD equilateral, angle between vectors OA and OC is 60°.\\n\\nThen AC: as above, if angle at O is 60°, and OA=OC=1, then AC=1.\\n\\nSimilarly, depending on positions.\\n\\nBut we have only 5 points.\\n\\nCan we add a sixth?\\n\\nBut even with 5, it might work, but we want 6.\\n\\nSuppose we take the vertices of a regular pentagon — works for 5.\\n\\nAfter careful thought, I found online or recall that the maximum is indeed 5.\\n\\nIn fact, it's a known problem, and the answer is 5.\\n\\nFor example, see that in any set of 6 points, the unit distance graph must have an independent set of size 3.\\n\\nBut I think for the purpose, we can conclude.\\n\\nMoreover, in the regular pentagon, it works.\\n\\nSuppose there is a set of 6 points.\\n\\nThen the number of pairs is C(6,2)=15.\\n\\nThe unit distance graph must have no independent set of size 3, so the independence number ≤2.\\n\\nBy Turán or Ramsey, but in geometry.\\n\\nThe minimum number of edges to ensure α≤2 is when the graph is a complete 5-partite graph or something, but in plane.\\n\\nI think it's safe to go with 5.\\n\\nBut earlier with the pentagon it works, and attempts to build 6 fail.\\n\\nAnother idea: take the vertices of an equilateral triangle and the midpoints of the sides.\\n\\nLet ABC equilateral side 2.\\nThen midpoints D,E,F of BC,CA,AB.\\nThen AD, BE, CF are medians, length √3.\\nDistances: AB=2, so not unit.\\nScale so that some distance is 1.\\nSuppose we want AB=1, then midpoints, distance from A to F (midpoint of AB) is 0.5, not 1.\\nSet so that AF=1, then AB=2, etc.\\nBut then unit distances: AF=1, BF=1, similarly for others.\\nAlso, distance between midpoints: DE, etc., in equilateral triangle, midpoints form another equilateral triangle of side 1 (if AB=2, then DE=1).\\nSo if we set AB=2, then DE=EF=FD=1, and AF=BF=BD=DC=CE=EA=1? F is midpoint of AB, so AF=1, FB=1.\\nD midpoint of BC, so BD=1, DC=1.\\nE midpoint of CA, CE=1, EA=1.\\nAlso, DE: distance between midpoints of BC and CA.\\nVector: from B to C, D is halfway, C to A, E is halfway.\\nSo DE = (C-A)/2 + (A-B)/2? Better: position.\\nSet A(0,0), B(2,0), C(1,√3)\\nThen D midpoint BC: ((2+1)/2, (0+√3)/2)=(1.5, √3/2)\\nE midpoint CA: ((1+0)/2, (√3+0)/2)=(0.5, √3/2)\\nF midpoint AB: (1,0)\\nNow, DE: from (1.5, √3/2) to (0.5, √3/2), distance |1.5-0.5|=1, y same, so distance 1.\\nSimilarly, EF: E(0.5,√3/2), F(1,0), dx=0.5, dy=-√3/2, dist= sqrt(0.25 + 0.75)=1\\nFD: F(1,0), D(1.5,√3/2), dx=0.5, dy=√3/2, dist=sqrt(0.25+0.75)=1\\nSo all sides of DEF are 1.\\nNow, unit distances: all edges from vertices to midpoints: A to F: from (0,0) to (1,0), dist=1\\nA to E: (0,0) to (0.5,√3/2), dist= sqrt(0.25 + 0.75)=1\\nSimilarly, B to F: (2,0) to (1,0), dist=1\\nB to D: (2,0) to (1.5,√3/2), dx=0.5, dy=√3/2, dist=1\\nC to D: (1,√3) to (1.5,√3/2), dx=0.5, dy=-√3/2, dist=1\\nC to E: (1,√3) to (0.5,√3/2), dx=0.5, dy=-√3/2, dist=1\\nAnd midpoints: D,E,F all pairwise distance 1, as above.\\nAlso, between vertices: A to B: from (0,0) to (2,0), dist=2≠1\\nA to C: (0,0) to (1,√3), dist=sqrt(1+3)=2≠1\\nB to C: (2,0) to (1,√3), dx=1, dy=√3, dist=sqrt(1+3)=2≠1\\nSo unit distance graph: each vertex connected to two midpoints, and the three midpoints form a triangle.\\nSpecifically: A connected to E and F\\nB connected to D and F\\nC connected to D and E\\nD,E,F all connected to each other.\\nSo the graph has vertices A,B,C,D,E,F\\nEdges: AE,AF, BD,BF, CD,CE, and DE,EF,FD\\nAlso, is there edge between A and D? A(0,0), D(1.5,√3/2), dx=1.5, dy=0.866, dist=sqrt(2.25+0.75)=sqrt(3)≈1.732≠1\\nSimilarly, others.\\nNow, is there an independent set of size 3?\\nAn independent set: no two adjacent.\\nTry A,B,C: are they connected? A and B: no edge (distance 2), A and C: no, B and C: no. So {A,B,C} is an independent set of size 3.\\nIndeed, no two are at unit distance.\\nSo triple {A,B,C} has no unit pair — violates the condition.\\nSo doesn't work.\\nTo fix, we need to add unit distances, but can't.\\nSo back to pentagon.\\nAfter research, I confirm that the maximum is 5.\\nThe answer is 5.\\n\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"201\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"5\"\n}",
