Then $f(x) = f(y) = f(z)$.\\n\\nNote: $f(a) = f(b) \\\\Rightarrow a - \\\\frac{1}{a} = b - \\\\frac{1}{b} \\\\Rightarrow ab(a - b) = b - a = -(a - b)$\\n\\nIf $a \\\\ne b$, then divide both sides by $a - b$: $ab = -1$\\n\\nSo either $a = b$ or $ab = -1$\\n\\nTherefore, for each pair among $x, y, z$, either they are equal or their product is $-1$.\\n\\nBut we also have symmetry in the equations.\\n\\nLet’s suppose $x = y = z$. Try this case first.\\n\\nAssume $x = y = z$. Then from any equation:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{x} + x + x = 3 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{x} + 2x = 3\\n$$\\n\\nMultiply by $x$: $1 + 2x^2 = 3x \\\\Rightarrow 2x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0$\\n\\nSolve: $x = \\\\frac{3 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{9 - 8}}{4} = \\\\frac{3 \\\\pm 1}{4} \\\\Rightarrow x = 1, \\\\frac{1}{2}$\\n\\nSo possible solutions:\\n\\n- $x = y = z = 1$: check: $\\\\frac{1}{1} + 1 + 1 = 3$, good.\\n- $x = y = z = \\\\frac{1}{2}$: $\\\\frac{1}{1/2} + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2} = 2 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 3$, good.\\n\\nSo two solutions so far: $x+y+z = 3$ or $1.5 = \\\\frac{3}{2}$\\n\\nBut maybe there are more where not all equal.\\n\\nRecall: for each pair, either $a = b$ or $ab = -1$\\n\\nSuppose not all equal. Let’s suppose $x = y \\\\ne z$, but then $f(x) = f(z)$, so either $x = z$ (then all equal), or $xz = -1$\\n\\nSo if $x = y$, and $x \\\\ne z$, then $xz = -1$\\n\\nTry this case: $x = y$, $xz = -1$\\n\\nFrom equation (1): $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{x} + x + z = 3$\\n\\nFrom equation (3): $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 2x + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 3$\\n\\nAlso, $z = -1/x$, since $xz = -1$\\n\\nSubstitute:\\n\\nEquation (1): $\\\\frac{1}{x} + x + (-1/x) = x = 3$? Wait:\\n\\n$\\\\frac{1}{x} + x + z = \\\\frac{1}{x} + x - \\\\frac{1}{x} = x = 3$\\n\\nSo $x = 3$\\n\\nThen $z = -1/x = -1/3$\\n\\nNow $y = x = 3$\\n\\nCheck all equations:\\n\\n1. $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{3} + 3 - \\\\frac{1}{3} = 3$, good.\\n2. $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = 3 + \\\\frac{1}{3} - \\\\frac{1}{3} = 3$, good.\\n3. $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 3 + 3 + \\\\frac{1}{-1/3} = 6 - 3 = 3$, good!\\n\\nSo another solution: $x=3, y=3, z=-1/3$, so $x+y+z = 3+3-1/3 = 6 - 1/3 = 17/3$\\n\\nWait, but earlier we assumed $x=y$, $xz=-1$, got this.\\n\\nBut is this symmetric? What if other variables differ?\\n\\nBut note: the condition is symmetric in a cyclic way, but not fully symmetric.\\n\\nWait — actually, looking back, the three expressions are:\\n\\n- $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z$\\n- $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z$\\n- $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z}$\\n\\nSo it's cyclic in $x,y,z$, but not fully symmetric.\\n\\nBut in our solution above, $x=y=3$, $z=-1/3$, works.\\n\\nNow, could we have other permutations?\\n\\nSuppose $x=z$, $xy=-1$?\\n\\nWait, need to be careful.\\n\\nWe have $f(x)=f(y)=f(z)$, so pairwise either equal or product -1.\\n\\nIn previous case, $x=y$, $xz=-1$, $yz = 3*(-1/3) = -1$, so actually $y z = -1$ too.\\n\\nSo in this solution: $x=y=3$, $z=-1/3$, so $x \\\\ne z$, $y \\\\ne z$, and indeed $xz = -1$, $yz = -1$, and $x=y$.\\n\\nNow, could we have all different?\\n\\nSuppose $x \\\\ne y$, $x \\\\ne z$, $y \\\\ne z$, then we must have $xy = -1$, $xz = -1$, $yz = -1$\\n\\nBut $xy = -1$, $xz = -1$ ⇒ $y = z = -1/x$, so $y=z$, contradiction.\\n\\nSo at least two must be equal.\\n\\nThus, only possibilities are: all three equal, or exactly two equal and the third different with product -1 with each of them.\\n\\nBut if two are equal, say $x=y$, and $x \\\\ne z$, then $xz = -1$, $yz = -1$ (same), and $xy = x^2$, which may not be -1.\\n\\nSo cases:\\n\\nCase 1: $x = y = z$: we found $x=1$ and $x=1/2$, giving sums $3$ and $3/2$\\n\\nCase 2: Exactly two equal.\\n\\nWithout loss of generality, suppose $x = y$, $x \\\\ne z$, and $xz = -1$\\n\\nAs above, we derived $x = 3$, $z = -1/3$\\n\\nBut is this the only possibility? In that derivation, from equation (1): $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{x} + x + z$\\n\\nBut $z = -1/x$, so $\\\\frac{1}{x} + x - \\\\frac{1}{x} = x = 3$ ⇒ $x=3$\\n\\nSo uniquely $x=3$\\n\\nBut now, this gives $x=y=3$, $z=-1/3$\\n\\nBut what if instead $y=z$, and $x$ different?\\n\\nTry: assume $y = z$, and $y \\\\ne x$, so $xy = -1$ (since $f(x)=f(y)$)\\n\\nNow use the equations.\\n\\nFrom equation (1): $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{x} + 2y = 3$\\n\\nFrom equation (2): $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + y = 3$\\n\\nAnd $xy = -1$ ⇒ $x = -1/y$\\n\\nSubstitute into (1): $\\\\frac{1}{(-1/y)} + 2y = -y + 2y = y = 3$ ⇒ $y=3$\\n\\nThen $x = -1/3$, $z = y = 3$\\n\\nNow check equation (2): $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = -1/3 + 1/3 + 3 = 3$, good.\\n\\nEquation (3): $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = -1/3 + 3 + 1/3 = 3$, good.\\n\\nSo another solution: $x=-1/3, y=3, z=3$, sum = $-1/3 + 3 + 3 = 17/3$ again\\n\\nSimilarly, if $x = z$, $x \\\\ne y$, then $xy = -1$\\n\\nSet $x = z$, $xy = -1$ ⇒ $y = -1/x$\\n\\nUse equation (2): $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + x = 2x + \\\\frac{1}{y}$\\n\\n$y = -1/x$ ⇒ $\\\\frac{1}{y} = -x$\\n\\nSo $2x + (-x) = x = 3$ ⇒ $x=3$\\n\\nThen $z = x = 3$, $y = -1/3$\\n\\nSum: $3 -1/3 + 3 = 17/3$\\n\\nSo in all asymmetric cases, we get sum $17/3$\\n\\nNow list all possible values of $x+y+z$:\\n\\n- From symmetric: $x=y=z=1$ → sum = 3\\n- $x=y=z=1/2$ → sum = 3/2\\n- From asymmetric: sum = 17/3 in all cases\\n\\nBut are these distinct values? Yes: 3, 1.5, ~5.666\\n\\nBut wait — is $x=y=z=1/2$ valid?\\n\\nCheck: $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = 2 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 3$, yes\\n$x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = 0.5 + 2 + 0.5 = 3$, yes\\nSame for third. Good.\\n\\nNow, are there any duplicates in sum values?\\n\\nThe asymmetric ones all give same sum 17/3, regardless of which variable differs.\\n\\nSo possible values of $x+y+z$ are: $3$, $\\\\frac{3}{2}$, and $\\\\frac{17}{3}$\\n\\nBut wait — are all these achievable? We have:\\n\\n1. (1,1,1) → sum 3\\n2. (0.5,0.5,0.5) → sum 1.5\\n3. (3,3,-1/3) and perm → sum 17/3 ≈5.666\\n\\nBut in the asymmetric case, we have three permutations, but same sum.\\n\\nSo the *distinct* possible values of $x+y+z$ are: $\\\\frac{3}{2}, 3, \\\\frac{17}{3}$\\n\\nSum of all possible values: $\\\\frac{3}{2} + 3 + \\\\frac{17}{3} = \\\\frac{3}{2} + \\\\frac{9}{3} + \\\\frac{17}{3} = \\\\frac{3}{2} + \\\\frac{26}{3}$\\n\\nBetter common denominator 6:\\n\\n$\\\\frac{3}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{6}$, no: $\\\\frac{3}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{6}$? No, $\\\\frac{3}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{6}$ is wrong.\\n\\n$\\\\frac{3}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{6}$? 9/6=1.5, yes, 3/2=1.5, yes.\\n\\nActually $\\\\frac{3}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{6}$, but better use 6:\\n\\n$\\\\frac{3}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{6}$? 3/2 = 9/6? 9/6=3/2, yes.\\n\\nBut let's compute:\\n\\n$\\\\frac{3}{2} + 3 + \\\\frac{17}{3} = \\\\frac{3}{2} + \\\\frac{3}{1} + \\\\frac{17}{3}$\\n\\nLCM of 2,1,3 is 6:\\n\\n= $\\\\frac{9}{6} + \\\\frac{18}{6} + \\\\frac{34}{6} = \\\\frac{61}{6}$\\n\\n9+18=27, +34=61, yes.\\n\\nSo sum is $\\\\frac{61}{6}$\\n\\nNow, is this correct? But wait — are all three values really possible?\\n\\nIn the asymmetric case, we have solutions like (3,3,-1/3), but let's verify $f(x)=f(y)=f(z)$:\\n\\nFor $x=3$: $3 - 1/3 = 8/3$\\n$y=3$: same $8/3$\\n$z=-1/3$: $-1/3 - 1/(-1/3) = -1/3 + 3 = 8/3$, yes.\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nBut in the symmetric case, $x=y=z=1$: $1-1=0$\\n$x=y=z=0.5$: $0.5 - 2 = -1.5$\\n\\nAll different k, but within each solution, same.\\n\\nNow, but in the problem, it says “the sum of all possible values of $x+y+z$”\\n\\nSo possible values are $\\\\frac{3}{2}, 3, \\\\frac{17}{3}$\\n\\nSum: $\\\\frac{3}{2} + 3 + \\\\frac{17}{3} = \\\\frac{9}{6} + \\\\frac{18}{6} + \\\\frac{34}{6} = \\\\frac{61}{6}$\\n\\nNow $m=61, n=6$, gcd(61,6)=1 since 61 prime.\\n\\nThen $100m + n = 100*61 + 6 = 6100 + 6 = 6106$\\n\\nBut wait — is $x=y=z=1/2$ acceptable? When we write $\\\\frac{1}{z}$, $z=1/2 \\\\ne 0$, fine.\\n\\nBut let me double-check the asymmetric case sum: $x+y+z=3+3-1/3=6-1/3=18/3-1/3=17/3$, yes.\\n\\nIs there any other solution?\\n\\nEarlier we assumed exactly two equal or all three.\\n\\nCould two be related by product -1 but not equal?\\n\\nBut we covered: if not all equal, then at least two equal, because if all pairs have product -1, impossible as shown.\\n\\nSuppose $x=y$, but $xz \\\\ne -1$, but then since $f(x)=f(z)$, must have $x=z$ or $xz=-1$. If $x=y$ and $x \\\\ne z$, then must have $xz=-1$. So no other possibilities.\\n\\nThus, only three possible values for the sum: $\\\\frac{3}{2}, 3, \\\\frac{17}{3}$\\n\\nSum: $\\\\frac{3}{2} + 3 + \\\\frac{17}{3} = \\\\frac{9 + 18 + 34}{6} = \\\\frac{61}{6}$\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 1: $100m + n = 100*61 + 6 = 6106$\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nRegular polygons: ICAO, VENTI, ALBEDO lie on a plane. Given IN = 1, compute number of possible values of ON.\\n\\nFirst, understand the polygons:\\n\\n- ICAO: vertices I, C, A, O — 4 vertices, so square? Regular quadrilateral, so square.\\n- VENTI: V,E,N,T,I — 5 vertices, regular pentagon.\\n- ALBEDO: A,L,B,E,D,O — 6 vertices, regular hexagon.\\n\\nThey share some vertices: I is in ICAO and VENTI; A and O are in ICAO and ALBEDO; E is in VENTI and ALBEDO; etc.\\n\\nGiven IN = 1, find possible lengths of ON.\\n\\nSince they are regular polygons sharing vertices, likely they are inscribed in circles, and we need to consider geometric configurations where these polygons share the specified vertices.\\n\\nThe key is that multiple polygons share vertices, so their positions are constrained.\\n\\nList the shared vertices:\\n\\n- I: in ICAO (quad) and VENTI (penta)\\n- A: in ICAO (quad) and ALBEDO (hex)\\n- O: in ICAO (quad) and ALBEDO (hex)\\n- E: in VENTI (penta) and ALBEDO (hex)\\n- N: in VENTI (penta)\\n- C: only in ICAO?\\n- V,T: only in VENTI?\\n- L,B,D: only in ALBEDO?\\n\\nSo common vertices: I,A,O,E are in two polygons, N only in VENTI, etc.\\n\\nNow, since the polygons are regular, their shapes are fixed, but they can be rotated, but sharing vertices fixes relative positions.\\n\\nMoreover, since they share multiple vertices, the relative positions might be determined up to symmetry.\\n\\nBut the problem asks for number of possible values of ON, given IN=1, implying that there might be multiple configurations satisfying the conditions.\\n\\nSo we need to consider how these regular polygons can be placed on the plane sharing the labeled vertices as per their names.\\n\\nThe polygons are named by their vertices in order? Probably cyclic order.\\n\\nAssume that the vertices are listed in cyclic order around the polygon.\\n\\nSo for ICAO: vertices in order I-C-A-O-I, so edges IC, CA, AO, OI.\\n\\nSimilarly, VENTI: V-E-N-T-I-V, so VE, EN, NT, TI, IV.\\n\\nALBEDO: A-L-B-E-D-O-A, so AL, LB, BE, ED, DO, OA.\\n\\nNow, since regular, all sides equal, all angles equal.\\n\\nNow, shared points:\\n\\n- I: vertex of square ICAO and pentagon VENTI\\n- A: vertex of square and hexagon\\n- O: vertex of square and hexagon\\n- E: vertex of pentagon and hexagon\\n\\nAlso, N is in pentagon, O in hexagon, and we need distance ON, given IN=1.\\n\\nSince IN=1 is given, and we need ON, probably scale is set by IN=1.\\n\\nNow, the challenge is that the relative positions of the polygons are not fully fixed; there might be different ways they can be attached.\\n\\nBut they share vertices, so the distances between shared vertices must match in both polygons.\\n\\nFor example, in square ICAO, distance IA: from I to A.\\n\\nIn the square, vertices I,C,A,O in order. Assuming convex regular quadrilateral, i.e., square.\\n\\nSo diagonal: I to A is diagonal if it's I-C-A-O, so I to A skips C, so diagonal.\\n\\nSimilarly, in pentagon VENTI: V-E-N-T-I, so I is adjacent to V and T? Order: ...T-I-V..., so I connected to T and V.\\n\\nN is connected to E and T.\\n\\nSo in pentagon, I and N are not adjacent; path I-T-N, so separated by one vertex, so distance is side length times golden ratio? In regular pentagon, diagonal length is $\\\\phi s$ where $\\\\phi=(1+\\\\sqrt{5})/2$\\n\\nSimilarly, in square ICAO: let side length be $s_4$. Then diagonal IA = $s_4 \\\\sqrt{2}$\\n\\nBut IA is also a distance in space, must be consistent.\\n\\nSimilarly, A and O are both in square and hexagon.\\n\\nIn square ICAO: A and O are adjacent? Order I-C-A-O, so A to O is an edge? After A is O, so yes, AO is a side of the square.\\n\\nSimilarly, in hexagon ALBEDO: A-L-B-E-D-O-A, so A to L, then L to B, ..., D to O, O to A. So O to A is an edge.\\n\\nSo AO is a side of both the square and the hexagon! So they must have the same side length? Not necessarily, because the polygons might be of different sizes, but AO is a common edge, so the length AO must be the same in both polygons.\\n\\nAO is a line segment between A and O, and it's an edge in both the square ICAO and the hexagon ALBEDO.\\n\\nTherefore, the side length of the square equals the side length of the hexagon.\\n\\nLet’s denote $s = $ length of AO, which is side of square and side of hexagon.\\n\\nNow, in pentagon VENTI, side length may be different.\\n\\nNow, point I is in square and pentagon.\\n\\nIn square ICAO, I is connected to C and O.\\n\\nDistance IO: in square, I and O are adjacent? Order I-C-A-O, so I to C, C to A, A to O, O to I. So yes, O to I is an edge. So IO is a side of the square, so length $s$.\\n\\nSimilarly, in pentagon VENTI, I is connected to V and T, so IV and IT are sides of pentagon.\\n\\nNow, we have point N in pentagon.\\n\\nIN is given as 1.\\n\\nIn the pentagon VENTI, what is the distance between I and N?\\n\\nVertices: V,E,N,T,I in order.\\n\\nSo sequence: V - E - N - T - I - V\\n\\nSo from I to N: I to T to N, or I to V to E to N? Shorter path: I-T-N, two edges, so they are separated by one vertex.\\n\\nIn a regular pentagon, the diagonal length (distance between vertices two apart) is $\\\\phi s_5$, where $s_5$ is side length, $\\\\phi = \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\\n\\nSince I to N is not adjacent (adjacent would be I-T or I-V), and not opposite (in pentagon, each vertex has two adjacent, two non-adjacent; the non-adjacent are both at diagonal distance).\\n\\nFrom I, adjacent are V and T.\\n\\nThe others: E and N.\\n\\nDistance to E: I to V to E or I to T to N to E, so longer, so I and E are not directly connected, but in cycle of 5, distance min(|i-j|,5-|i-j|)\\n\\nLabel vertices in order: say position 1:V, 2:E, 3:N, 4:T, 5:I\\n\\nThen I is 5, N is 3, |5-3|=2, so two steps apart, so diagonal, length $d_5 = s_5 \\\\phi$\\n\\nSimilarly, I to E: |5-2|=3, min(3,2)=2? 5-2=3, 5-3=2 in cycle? Distance min(|i-j|, 5-|i-j|) = min(3,2)=2, same.\\n\\nSo yes, IN is a diagonal of the pentagon, so length $s_5 \\\\phi = 1$\\n\\nSo $s_5 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1$ ⇒ $s_5 = \\\\frac{2}{1+\\\\sqrt{5}} = \\\\frac{2}{1+\\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{\\\\sqrt{5}-1} = \\\\frac{2(\\\\sqrt{5}-1)}{5-1} = \\\\frac{2(\\\\sqrt{5}-1)}{4} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$\\n\\nBut we may not need the value yet.\\n\\nNow, we need to relate to the other polygons.\\n\\nWe have points I, A, O, E shared.\\n\\nWe know AO = s (side of square and hexagon)\\n\\nIO = s (side of square)\\n\\nIn square ICAO, with vertices I,C,A,O in order.\\n\\nAssuming it's convex and regular, so it's a square.\\n\\nThe angle at each vertex is 90 degrees.\\n\\nSimilarly, hexagon ALBEDO is regular, so internal angle 120 degrees, but we care about positions.\\n\\nNow, the key is that both polygons share edge AO? Do they?\\n\\nSquare has edge AO? Earlier: order I-C-A-O, so edges IC, CA, AO, OI. Yes, AO is an edge.\\n\\nHexagon: A-L-B-E-D-O-A, so edges AL, LB, BE, ED, DO, OA. OA is same as AO, so yes, AO is an edge of both polygons.\\n\\nTherefore, the two polygons share the entire edge AO.\\n\\nSo they are glued along the edge AO.\\n\\nNow, when two regular polygons share an edge, they can be on the same side or opposite sides, but since it's a plane, and polygons are likely simple, probably they are on opposite sides of the edge, or same side, but if same side, might overlap.\\n\\nTypically in such problems, they are coplanar and may be folded, but since it's a plane, they must be coplanar, so the dihedral angle is 0 or 180, but in plane, it's flat.\\n\\nWhen two polygons share an edge in a plane, they can be on the same side or opposite sides, but if they are both convex and share an edge, usually they are adjacent, so the angle between them at the edge determines the configuration.\\n\\nSpecifically, for two regular polygons sharing an edge, the angle between their planes—but they are in a plane, so the angle between the two half-planes.\\n\\nAt edge AO, the square ICAO has a certain direction, and the hexagon ALBEDO has another.\\n\\nIn the square, at edge AO, the next vertex from A is I? From A, in square, neighbors are C and O? Order I-C-A-O, so at A, incoming from C, outgoing to O, so the two edges at A are C-A and A-O.\\n\\nSimilarly, at O, edges A-O and O-I.\\n\\nThe internal angle of the square at A is 90 degrees.\\n\\nSimilarly, for hexagon at A: neighbors are O and L? Order A-L-B-...-O-A, so at A, edges O-A and A-L.\\n\\nInternal angle of regular hexagon is 120 degrees.\\n\\nWhen they share edge AO, the two polygons are on opposite sides of the line AO, or on the same side.\\n\\nBut if they are both on the same side, and convex, they might overlap or not, but typically in such configurations, they are adjacent, so the angle between the two polygons at edge AO is the sum or difference of the external angles.\\n\\nConsider the direction.\\n\\nFix edge AO on the x-axis.\\n\\nSet coordinate system: place point A at origin (0,0), point O at (s, 0), since AO = s.\\n\\nNow, for the square ICAO. Vertices in order I-C-A-O.\\n\\nFrom A to O is vector (s,0).\\n\\nNow, in the square, going from C to A to O.\\n\\nThe turn at A: since it's a square, internal angle 90 degrees, so the direction changes by 90 degrees.\\n\\nDepending on the orientation.\\n\\nThe order is I-C-A-O, so traversing the boundary.\\n\\nFrom C to A to O.\\n\\nThe vector from C to A, then A to O.\\n\\nThe angle at A is 90 degrees inside the polygon.\\n\\nFor a convex polygon, the turn is consistent.\\n\\nAssuming counter-clockwise traversal.\\n\\nSuppose we traverse I-C-A-O-I counter-clockwise.\\n\\nThen from C to A: direction towards A.\\n\\nThen from A to O: direction along AO, which is (s,0), so positive x-direction.\\n\\nSince internal angle is 90 degrees, and we're turning left (ccw), the incoming direction to A should be from below or above.\\n\\nThe vector from C to A: since we turn 90 degrees left at A to go along AO.\\n\\nWhen traversing, the direction change.\\n\\nThe vector into A is from C to A, vector out is from A to O = (s,0).\\n\\nThe turn angle: for a polygon, the exterior angle.\\n\\nIn a regular polygon, at each vertex, the direction turns by a fixed amount.\\n\\nFor square, exterior angle is 90 degrees.\\n\\nSince ccw, we turn left by 90 degrees at each vertex.\\n\\nSo at vertex A, we are coming from C to A, then going to O.\\n\\nThe direction from C to A, then we turn left 90 degrees to go in direction of A to O.\\n\\nThe direction of A to O is (s,0), so east.\\n\\nAfter turning left 90 degrees, we face east, so before turning, we were facing north (because left turn from north is to west? No.\\n\\nIf I'm moving in a direction, and I turn left 90 degrees, my new direction is perpendicular.\\n\\nSuppose I arrive at A moving in direction vector **v**, then after turning left 90 degrees, I depart in direction **v** rotated by 90 degrees counter-clockwise, which is (-v_y, v_x).\\n\\nAnd this departure direction is (s,0), so unit vector (1,0).\\n\\nSo (-v_y, v_x) = (1,0) ⇒ -v_y = 1, v_x = 0 ⇒ v_x=0, v_y=-1\\n\\nSo arrival direction is (0,-1), south.\\n\\nSo vector from C to A is in direction (0,-1), so downward.\\n\\nSince distance: in square, side length s, so vector C to A is (0,-s)? Magnitude s, direction (0,-1), so (0,-s).\\n\\nThus, C is at A + (0,s)? Vector from C to A is (0,-s), so A - C = (0,-s) ⇒ C = A - (0,-s) = A + (0,s) = (0,0) + (0,s) = (0,s)\\n\\nA is (0,0), so C = (0,s)\\n\\nThen from A to O: (s,0), so O is (s,0)\\n\\nNow, from O to I: in the square, next vertex.\\n\\nAt O, we come from A to O, vector (s,0), so direction (1,0)\\n\\nThen turn left 90 degrees for ccw traversal.\\n\\nArrival direction: from A to O: (s,0), so (1,0)\\n\\nTurn left 90 deg: rotate (-v_y, v_x) = (-0, 1) = (0,1), so north.\\n\\nSo depart in direction (0,1), so vector O to I is (0,s)\\n\\nThus I is at O + (0,s) = (s,0) + (0,s) = (s,s)\\n\\nNow, check distance I to C: C is (0,s), I is (s,s), distance |s-0|=s in x, same y, so distance s, good, and it should be a side.\\n\\nSo square is at: A(0,0), O(s,0), I(s,s), C(0,s)\\n\\nNow, the hexagon ALBEDO shares edge AO, so A(0,0), O(s,0)\\n\\nNow, hexagon vertices: A-L-B-E-D-O-A, in order.\\n\\nAssuming counter-clockwise traversal.\\n\\nAt vertex A, we come from O to A, then go to L.\\n\\nVector into A: from O to A: O(s,0) to A(0,0), so (-s,0), direction (-1,0)\\n\\nThen turn left 90 degrees? For hexagon, exterior angle is 60 degrees? Regular hexagon, interior angle 120, so exterior angle is 180-120=60 degrees.\\n\\nFor regular polygon, exterior angle is 360/n degrees.\\n\\nHexagon, n=6, exterior angle 60 degrees.\\n\\nSince ccw, turn left 60 degrees at each vertex.\\n\\nSo at A, arrival direction: from O to A: (-s,0), so direction (-1,0)\\n\\nTurn left 60 degrees: rotate vector (-1,0) by 60 deg ccw? The turn is applied to the direction.\\n\\nWhen arriving in direction **v**, after turning left by exterior angle θ, the departure direction is **v** rotated by θ ccw.\\n\\nRotation by φ ccw: (x,y) → (x cos φ - y sin φ, x sin φ + y cos φ)\\n\\nSo **v** = (-1,0), θ=60°, cos60=0.5, sin60=√3/2\\n\\nRotate: x' = (-1)(0.5) - (0)(√3/2) = -0.5\\ny' = (-1)(√3/2) + (0)(0.5) = -√3/2\\n\\nSo departure direction: (-0.5, -√3/2)\\n\\nThis is unit vector? Magnitude: sqrt(0.25 + 0.75) = sqrt(1)=1, yes.\\n\\nSo vector from A to L is s times this direction, since side length s (same as square).\\n\\nSo A to L: s * (-0.5, -√3/2) = (-s/2, -s √3 / 2)\\n\\nThus L is at A + (-s/2, -s √3 / 2) = (0,0) + (-s/2, -s √3 / 2) = (-s/2, -s √3 / 2)\\n\\nNow, we can continue, but we need point E.\\n\\nFrom A to L, then L to B, etc.\\n\\nAt L, we arrive from A to L: direction (-0.5, -√3/2)\\n\\nTurn left 60 deg: rotate this vector by 60 deg ccw.\\n\\nVector **v** = (-0.5, -√3/2)\\n\\nRotate by 60 deg ccw:\\nx' = v_x cos60 - v_y sin60 = (-0.5)(0.5) - (-√3/2)(√3/2) = -0.25 - ( -3/4 ) = -0.25 + 0.75 = 0.5\\ny' = v_x sin60 + v_y cos60 = (-0.5)(√3/2) + (-√3/2)(0.5) = -√3/4 - √3/4 = -√3/2\\n\\nSo direction (0.5, -√3/2)\\n\\nSo vector L to B: s * (0.5, -√3/2) = (s/2, -s √3 / 2)\\n\\nThus B is at L + (s/2, -s √3 / 2) = (-s/2, -s √3 / 2) + (s/2, -s √3 / 2) = (0, -s √3)\\n\\nThen from B to E: at B, arrive from L to B: direction (0.5, -√3/2)\\n\\nTurn left 60 deg: rotate by 60 ccw:\\nx' = (0.5)(0.5) - (-√3/2)(√3/2) = 0.25 - (-3/4) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1\\ny' = (0.5)(√3/2) + (-√3/2)(0.5) = √3/4 - √3/4 = 0\\n\\nSo direction (1,0)\\n\\nVector B to E: s*(1,0) = (s,0)\\n\\nThus E is at B + (s,0) = (0, -s √3) + (s,0) = (s, -s √3)\\n\\nThen from E to D: arrive direction (1,0), turn left 60 deg: rotate (1,0) by 60 ccw: (cos60, sin60) = (0.5, √3/2)\\n\\nVector E to D: s*(0.5, √3/2) = (s/2, s √3 / 2)\\n\\nD at E + (s/2, s √3 / 2) = (s, -s √3) + (s/2, s √3 / 2) = (3s/2, -s √3 / 2)\\n\\nThen D to O: arrive direction (0.5, √3/2), turn left 60 deg: rotate by 60 ccw:\\nx' = (0.5)(0.5) - (√3/2)(√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = -0.5\\ny' = (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2\\n\\nDirection (-0.5, √3/2)\\n\\nVector D to O: s*(-0.5, √3/2) = (-s/2, s √3 / 2)\\n\\nO is at D + (-s/2, s √3 / 2) = (3s/2, -s √3 / 2) + (-s/2, s √3 / 2) = (s, 0), which matches, good.\\n\\nSo E is at (s, -s √3)\\n\\nNow, we have the pentagon VENTI, which includes points V,E,N,T,I.\\n\\nE and I are already placed: E(s, -s √3), I(s,s)\\n\\nAnd N is in pentagon, and IN=1.\\n\\nThe pentagon is regular, with vertices V,E,N,T,I in order.\\n\\nSo it must pass through E and I, and be regular.\\n\\nMoreover, since it's regular, the side length is constant, and angles.\\n\\nNow, the distance between E and I is fixed from above: E(s, -s √3), I(s,s)\\n\\nSo same x-coordinate, y from -s√3 to s, so distance |s - (-s√3)| = s(1 + √3)\\n\\nCompute: dy = s - (-s √3) = s(1 + √3), dx=0, so distance = s(1 + √3)\\n\\nIn the pentagon, E and I are two vertices. What is their separation in the cycle?\\n\\nVertices: V,E,N,T,I\\n\\nSo order: V - E - N - T - I - V\\n\\nSo from E to I: E to N to T to I, three steps, or E to V to I? Two steps? Path E-V-I or E-N-T-I.\\n\\nShortest path: E to V to I: two edges, or E to N to T to I: three edges, so minimum two edges apart.\\n\\nThe graph distance is min over paths.\\n\\nIn cycle of 5, distance between E and I: positions: say E:2, I:5, |5-2|=3, min(3,5-3)=min(3,2)=2, so two edges apart, so they are not adjacent, but separated by one vertex.\\n\\nSpecifically, from E, adjacent are V and N.\\n\\nI is adjacent to V and T.\\n\\nSo common neighbor is V? E-V and I-V, so V is adjacent to both.\\n\\nSo E and I are both adjacent to V, so in the pentagon, E and I are connected via V, so distance 2.\\n\\nIn terms of vertex indices, if E is vertex 2, I is vertex 5, then |2-5|=3, but in cycle, distance min(3,2)=2, yes.\\n\\nIn a regular pentagon, two vertices separated by two edges (i.e., two steps along the polygon) are at distance equal to the diagonal, same as before, $s_5 \\\\phi$, where $s_5$ is side length, $\\\\phi = \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\\n\\nIs that correct? In pentagon, each pair of non-adjacent vertices is at diagonal distance, and since it's small, all diagonals are equal.\\n\\nNumber of diagonals: each vertex connects to two non-adjacent, total 5*2/2=5 diagonals, all equal in regular pentagon.\\n\\nAnd the diagonal length is $s_5 \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2} = s_5 \\\\phi$\\n\\nNow, here, distance between E and I is $s(1 + \\\\sqrt{3})$, as computed.\\n\\nBut in the pentagon, this distance must be equal to the chord length corresponding to their separation.\\n\\nSeparation: as above, they are two edges apart, so diagonal, so distance should be $s_5 \\\\phi$\\n\\nBut is it always diagonal? In a pentagon, vertices separated by one vertex (like E and N) are adjacent? E to N is direct edge, since E-N is an edge.\\n\\nE to I: as above, not adjacent, and since only five vertices, any two non-adjacent are at diagonal distance.\\n\\nAdjacent pairs: V-E, E-N, N-T, T-I, I-V\\n\\nNon-adjacent: V-N, V-T, E-T, E-I, N-I\\n\\nE and I are not adjacent, so yes, distance is diagonal, $d = s_5 \\\\phi$\\n\\nSo we have:\\n\\nDistance EI = $s(1 + \\\\sqrt{3}) = s_5 \\\\phi = s_5 \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\\n\\nAdditionally, we have IN = 1, and IN is also a diagonal of the pentagon, since I and N are not adjacent (I adjacent to V,T; N adjacent to E,T; so I and N both adjacent to T, so distance 2, diagonal), so IN = $s_5 \\\\phi = 1$\\n\\nIN = 1, and IN is diagonal, so $s_5 \\\\phi = 1$\\n\\nBut EI is also diagonal, so EI = $s_5 \\\\phi = 1$\\n\\nBut from geometry, EI = s(1 + √3)\\n\\nSo s(1 + √3) = 1\\n\\nThus s = 1 / (1 + √3) = √3 - 1? Rationalize: multiply numerator and denominator by √3 -1:\\n\\ns = 1 / (1 + √3) * (√3 -1)/(√3 -1) = (√3 -1) / (3 - 1) = (√3 -1)/2\\n\\nBut now, we also have point I and N, and we need ON.\\n\\nBut in this configuration, we have s, and we can find coordinates.\\n\\nBut we have IN=1, and we used that EI= s_5 φ =1, same as IN, so EI=1.\\n\\nBut is this the only possibility?\\n\\nWe assumed the orientations: for the square and hexagon, we assumed counter-clockwise traversal.\\n\\nBut perhaps they could be clockwise.\\n\\nMoreover, when placing the hexagon, we assumed it's below the x-axis, but it could be above.\\n\\nIn our setup, we placed the square above AO: A(0,0), O(s,0), I(s,s), C(0,s), so in the upper half-plane.\\n\\nFor the hexagon, we placed it below: E(s, -s√3), etc., in lower half-plane.\\n\\nBut could the hexagon be on the same side?\\n\\nSuppose we place the hexagon also above.\\n\\nBut then it might overlap or conflict.\\n\\nTry: same edge AO, but hexagon on the other side.\\n\\nSo at vertex A, for hexagon, if we traverse clockwise instead.\\n\\nThe problem doesn't specify the orientation, so we need to consider both.\\n\\nSo case 1: both polygons ccw, as above, hexagon below.\\n\\nCase 2: square ccw (upper), hexagon cw (which would be upper side).\\n\\nOr other combinations.\\n\\nSince the shared edge is AO, and polygons are regular, the relative position depends on the dihedral angle, but in plane, it's determined by which side they are on.\\n\\nFor the hexagon, when sharing edge AO, it can be on the side opposite to the square or on the same side.\\n\\nIn our first case, square is above (y>0), hexagon is below (y<0).\\n\\nIf hexagon is also above, then since both are convex, they might overlap, but possibly not, depending.\\n\\nLet’s compute.\\n\\nSo alternative: hexagon traversed clockwise.\\n\\nSo for hexagon ALBEDO, clockwise: A to O to D to E to B to L to A? Order given is A-L-B-E-D-O-A, which suggests A to L to B etc., so if clockwise, but the sequence might imply direction.\\n\\nThe name is given as ALBEDO, which might imply order A-L-B-E-D-O, so probably the cyclic order is fixed by the naming.\\n\\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps the polygon is defined by the sequence of vertices, and we assume it's traversed in that order, but it could be clockwise or counter-clockwise, but typically it's consistent.\\n\\nHowever, for the shape, it doesn't matter, but for embedding, the orientation matters.\\n\\nSo when we fix the edge AO, the third vertex from A can be on one side or the other.\\n\\nIn the square, from A, after O, but in the sequence I-C-A-O, so from A, the next is O, but the previous is C.\\n\\nThe two adjacent vertices to A are C and O.\\n\\nThe vector from A to C and A to O.\\n\\nIn our earlier ccw case, A to O: (s,0), A to C: since C is (0,s), so (0,s) - (0,0) = (0,s), so upward.\\n\\nThe angle at A is between vectors A to C and A to O.\\n\\nVectors u = AC = (0,s), v = AO = (s,0)\\n\\nDot product u·v = 0*s + s*0 = 0, so 90 degrees, good.\\n\\nFor the hexagon, at A, adjacent vertices are L and O.\\n\\nVectors A to L and A to O.\\n\\nA to O is (s,0)\\n\\nA to L: in the hexagon, depending on orientation.\\n\\nThe internal angle is 120 degrees.\\n\\nSo the two vectors from A, the angle between them is 120 degrees.\\n\\nThe direction: the third vertex L can be at 120 degrees from AO.\\n\\nIn the plane, from vector AO = (s,0), the vector AL can be at +120 degrees or -120 degrees from it.\\n\\nIn our first case, we had AL at direction (-0.5, -√3/2), which is 240 degrees or -120 degrees from positive x-axis.\\n\\nSince AO is at 0 degrees, so angle between them: from 0 to 240, difference 240, but smaller angle is min(240, 360-240)=min(240,120)=120 degrees, and since dot product: (s,0) · (-s/2, -s√3/2) = s*(-s/2) + 0 = -s²/2, magnitude both s, so cos theta = (-s²/2)/(s*s) = -0.5, so theta=120 degrees, good.\\n\\nThe other possibility is at +120 degrees: so direction (cos120, sin120) = (-0.5, √3/2)\\n\\nSo AL = s * (-0.5, √3/2) = (-s/2, s √3 / 2)\\n\\nThen L at (0,0) + (-s/2, s √3 / 2) = (-s/2, s √3 / 2)\\n\\nThen similarly, we can find E.\\n\\nBut now, this is in the upper half-plane, same as the square.\\n\\nNow, the square has points up to y=s, this has y up to s√3/2 ≈ 0.866s < s, but let's see if they overlap.\\n\\nBut more importantly, we need to place the pentagon.\\n\\nNow, in this case, E will be at higher y.\\n\\nLet’s compute E for this orientation.\\n\\nHexagon clockwise: but the vertex order is given as A-L-B-E-D-O-A, which if we go A to L to B, with AL at (-0.5, √3/2), which is 120 deg, then to B.\\n\\nAt L, if we are going clockwise, the turn is right, but to be consistent, let's follow the sequence.\\n\\nFrom A to L: vector (-s/2, s √3 / 2)\\n\\nThen from L to B: in regular hexagon, the direction.\\n\\nIf clockwise, at L, the interior angle 120, so turn right 60 degrees (exterior angle).\\n\\nArrival direction at L: from A to L: (-s/2, s √3 / 2), direction (-0.5, √3/2)\\n\\nFor clockwise traversal, we turn right by exterior angle 60 degrees.\\n\\nRotating a vector right by 60 deg is same as rotating left by -60 deg, or 300 deg.\\n\\nRotation by -60 deg: (x,y) → (x cos(-60) - y sin(-60), x sin(-60) + y cos(-60)) = (x*0.5 - y*(-√3/2), x*(-√3/2) + y*0.5) = (0.5x + (√3/2)y, - (√3/2)x + 0.5y)\\n\\nSo apply to arrival direction (-0.5, √3/2):\\nx' = 0.5*(-0.5) + (√3/2)*(√3/2) = -0.25 + (3/4) = 0.5\\ny' = - (√3/2)*(-0.5) + 0.5*(√3/2) = (√3/4) + (√3/4) = √3/2\\n\\nSo departure direction (0.5, √3/2)\\n\\nVector L to B: s*(0.5, √3/2) = (s/2, s √3 / 2)\\n\\nB at L + (s/2, s √3 / 2) = (-s/2, s √3 / 2) + (s/2, s √3 / 2) = (0, s √3)\\n\\nThen B to E: arrive direction (0.5, √3/2), turn right 60 deg: rotate by -60 deg:\\nx' = 0.5*0.5 + (√3/2)*(√3/2) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1? Wait no:\\n\\nVector v = (0.5, √3/2)\\n\\nx' = 0.5*v_x + (√3/2)*v_y = 0.5*0.5 + (√3/2)*(√3/2) = 0.25 + (3/4) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1\\ny' = - (√3/2)*v_x + 0.5*v_y = - (√3/2)*0.5 + 0.5*(√3/2) = -√3/4 + √3/4 = 0\\n\\nSo direction (1,0)\\n\\nVector B to E: s*(1,0) = (s,0)\\n\\nE at B + (s,0) = (0, s √3) + (s,0) = (s, s √3)\\n\\nThen continue, but we have E(s, s √3)\\n\\nNow, I is at (s,s) from square.\\n\\nNow, distance EI: E(s, s√3), I(s,s), so dx=0, dy= s√3 - s = s(√3 -1), so distance |s(√3 -1)|\\n\\nNow, in the pentagon, E and I are two vertices, distance should be the chord length.\\n\\nAs before, they are separated by two edges, so distance should be s_5 φ, the diagonal.\\n\\nAlso, IN=1, and IN is also a diagonal, so s_5 φ =1, thus EI should also be 1, since same chord length.\\n\\nSo |s(√3 -1)| =1\\n\\nSince s>0, √3>1, so s(√3 -1) =1 ⇒ s = 1/(√3 -1) = (√3 +1)/2 after rationalizing.\\n\\nNow, previously in the other configuration, we had s(1+√3)=1, so s=1/(1+√3)=(√3-1)/2\\n\\nNow here s=(√3+1)/2\\n\\nDifferent.\\n\\nNow, we also have the pentagon to place, but in both cases, we have E and I fixed, and the pentagon must include them, with regular pentagon.\\n\\nBut in a regular pentagon, given two points, there might be multiple positions, but here the distance EI is fixed, and it must be a diagonal, so s_5 is determined by EI = s_5 φ, and since IN=1 is also diagonal, s_5 φ =1, so EI must be 1.\\n\\nTherefore, in any configuration, we must have EI =1.\\n\\nSo in the first configuration (hexagon below), we had EI = s(1+√3) =1\\n\\nIn the second (hexagon above), EI = s|√3 -1| = s(√3 -1) =1\\n\\nNow, are there more configurations?\\n\\nWe also have the square: we assumed it is above, but could it be below?\\n\\nSymmetric.\\n\\nBut also, the orientation of the square.\\n\\nIn the square, we assumed ccw, but could be cw.\\n\\nSuppose square is clockwise.\\n\\nSo vertices I-C-A-O, but clockwise.\\n\\nSo from I to C to A to O to I, clockwise.\\n\\nSet A(0,0), O(s,0)\\n\\nAt A, come from C to A, go to O.\\n\\nArrival direction from C to A, departure to O: (s,0)\\n\\nFor clockwise, turn right by 90 degrees (exterior angle).\\n\\nDeparture direction is rotation of arrival direction by -90 deg (right turn).\\n\\nRotation by -90 deg: (x,y) → (x*0 - y*(-1), x*(-1) + y*0) wait: cos(-90)=0, sin(-90)=-1\\n\\n(x,y) → (x*0 - y*(-1), x*(-1) + y*0) = (y, -x)? Standard: rotation -90 deg: (x,y) → (y, -x)\\n\\nSo if departure direction is (1,0), then arrival direction rotated by -90 deg gives (1,0)\\n\\nSo if arrival vector v, then rotate(v) = (v_y, -v_x) = (1,0)\\n\\nSo v_y =1, -v_x=0 ⇒ v_x=0, v_y=1\\n\\nSo arrival direction (0,1), north.\\n\\nSo vector from C to A is (0,s), so C is at A - (0,s) = (0,-s)\\n\\nThen at O, come from A to O: (s,0), direction (1,0)\\n\\nTurn right 90 deg: rotate by -90 deg: (1,0) → (0,-1)\\n\\nSo departure to I: (0,-s)\\n\\nI at O + (0,-s) = (s,0) + (0,-s) = (s,-s)\\n\\nSo square is below: A(0,0), O(s,0), I(s,-s), C(0,-s)\\n\\nNow, hexagon can be above or below.\\n\\nFirst, hexagon above: as in second case earlier, E at (s, s√3)\\n\\nBut now I is at (s,-s)\\n\\nDistance EI: E(s,s√3), I(s,-s), dy= s√3 - (-s) = s(√3 +1), dx=0, so distance s(1+√3)\\n\\nMust be 1, so s(1+√3)=1\\n\\nSimilarly, if hexagon below, with cw or ccw.\\n\\nFor hexagon, if we want it below, with cw traversal.\\n\\nEarlier for hexagon below with ccw, we had E at (s,-s√3)\\n\\nNow with cw, below.\\n\\nBut let's systematize.\\n\\nThe key is that for the hexagon, given AO, the position of E depends on the orientation.\\n\\nFrom earlier calculations:\\n\\n- If hexagon ccw and we want the 'standard' position, E was at (s, -s√3) when A(0,0),O(s,0)\\n\\n- If hexagon cw, E at (s, s√3)\\n\\nSimilarly for square:\\n\\n- Square ccw: I at (s,s)\\n- Square cw: I at (s,-s)\\n\\nNow, E's y-coordinate: for hexagon, if ccw, E_y = -s√3; if cw, E_y = s√3\\n\\nI's y-coordinate: if square ccw, I_y = s; if cw, I_y = -s\\n\\nNow, distance EI: since same x=s, distance |E_y - I_y|\\n\\nNow, E_y and I_y depend on choices.\\n\\nLet a = orientation of square: +1 for ccw (I_y = s), -1 for cw (I_y = -s)\\n\\nb = orientation of hexagon: +1 for cw (E_y = s√3), -1 for ccw (E_y = -s√3)? \\n\\nDefine:\\n\\nSet δ_s = +1 if square ccw, -1 if cw → I_y = δ_s * s\\n\\nδ_h = +1 if hexagon cw, -1 if ccw → E_y = δ_h * s √3\\n\\nThen EI = |E_y - I_y| = |δ_h s √3 - δ_s s| = s |δ_h √3 - δ_s|\\n\\nNow, δ_h and δ_s are ±1, so we can compute for each combination.\\n\\nCase 1: δ_s =1, δ_h=1: |1*√3 - 1| = |√3 -1| = √3 -1 (since √3>1)\\n\\nCase 2: δ_s=1, δ_h=-1: |-√3 -1| = |-(√3+1)| = √3+1\\n\\nCase 3: δ_s=-1, δ_h=1: |√3 - (-1)| = |√3 +1| = √3+1\\n\\nCase 4: δ_s=-1, δ_h=-1: |-√3 - (-1)| = |-√3 +1| = |1 - √3| = √3 -1 (since √3>1)\\n\\nSo possible EI = s(√3 +1) or s(√3 -1)\\n\\nBut we need EI =1, since it must equal the diagonal length, which is 1 (because IN=1 and same chord type).\\n\\nSo either s(√3 +1) =1 or s(√3 -1)=1\\n\\nThus s = 1/(√3 +1) or s=1/(√3 -1)\\n\\nWhich are (√3 -1)/2 and (√3 +1)/2 after rationalizing, as before.\\n\\nNow, for each such s, we have a configuration, but we need to ensure that the pentagon can be formed with E and I at distance 1, and IN=1, but since we set EI=1, and IN=1, and both are diagonals, so in the pentagon, s_5 φ =1, so s_5 = 2/(1+√5) as before.\\n\\nNow, the issue is whether with E and I fixed, and distance 1, and we need to place a regular pentagon with vertices including E and I, and the order V,E,N,T,I.\\n\\nSince it's a regular pentagon, and we know two vertices, and the order, there might be multiple ways to place it.\\n\\nSpecifically, given two points E and I, distance d=1, and they are not adjacent (since diagonal), in a regular pentagon, there are generally two possible regular pentagons that have E and I as vertices with the given separation.\\n\\nIn a regular pentagon, for two vertices at diagonal distance, they can be connected by a diagonal, and there are two possible pentagons: one on each \"side\".\\n\\nMore precisely, given two points, the regular pentagon can be completed in two ways, symmetric with respect to the line joining them.\\n\\nBut in this case, since the plane is fixed, and we have other constraints, but here the only constraint is the positions, but once E and I are fixed, and we need to place N such that the pentagon is regular with the order.\\n\\nThe order is fixed: V,E,N,T,I, so the sequence.\\n\\nFrom E to I, along the pentagon, it can go E-N-T-I or E-V-I, but since it's a cycle, and order is given, likely it's E to N to T to I, so three steps, or E to V to I, two steps.\\n\\nIn the sequence V,E,N,T,I, it's listed as V then E then N then T then I, so probably the order is V-E-N-T-I-V, so from E to I: E-N-T-I, three edges.\\n\\nEarlier I assumed two edges, but let's check.\\n\\nThe sequence is V,E,N,T,I. So if it's in order, then V to E to N to T to I to V.\\n\\nSo edges: V-E, E-N, N-T, T-I, I-V.\\n\\nSo from E to I: E to N to T to I, three edges, or E to V to I? But E to V is not direct; E is connected to V and N? From edges, E is adjacent to V and N.\\n\\nI is adjacent to T and V.\\n\\nSo E and I are both adjacent to V, so path E-V-I, two edges.\\n\\nThe shortest path is two edges.\\n\\nIn terms of graph distance, it's 2.\\n\\nIn the cycle, the number of edges along the shorter arc.\\n\\nFrom E to I: clockwise: E-N-T-I, three edges; counter-clockwise: E-V-I, two edges. So shorter is two edges.\\n\\nIn a pentagon, vertices at graph distance 2 are at diagonal distance, same as before.\\n\\nThe chord length depends only on the number of edges apart, not on the path.\\n\\nIn regular pentagon, all chords spanning two edges (i.e., skipping one vertex) are equal, and are the diagonal.\\n\\nSpanning one edge is side, two edges is diagonal.\\n\\nHere, E to I spans two edges along the shorter path, so distance is diagonal, s_5 φ.\\n\\nSame as IN: I to N, path I-T-N or I-V-E-N, shorter is I-T-N, two edges, so diagonal.\\n\\nSo yes, EI = IN = s_5 φ =1.\\n\\nNow, given E and I fixed, distance 1, we need to place a regular pentagon with vertices E and I, and the order V,E,N,T,I.\\n\\nThe order implies that from E, next is N, and from I, previous is T, and I to V, etc.\\n\\nSpecifically, in the cycle, E is adjacent to V and N.\\n\\nI is adjacent to T and V.\\n\\nSince both adjacent to V, and V is common neighbor.\\n\\nIn the pentagon, E and I are not adjacent, but share a common neighbor V.\\n\\nGiven E and I, the point V must be such that EV and IV are both sides of the pentagon, so |EV| = |IV| = s_5, and angle at V, but more importantly, in the regular pentagon, the position of V relative to E and I.\\n\\nSince it's symmetric, there are two possible positions for V: one on each side of the line EI.\\n\\nSimilarly for other points.\\n\\nBut once V is placed, the rest is determined.\\n\\nThe distance from E to V is s_5, I to V is s_5, and E to I is 1.\\n\\nSo triangle EIV has EI=1, EV=s_5, IV=s_5, so isosceles triangle.\\n\\ns_5 = 2/(1+√5) = (√5 -1)/2 * something, earlier s_5 φ =1, φ=(1+√5)/2, so s_5 = 1/φ = 2/(1+√5) = (2/(1+√5)) * (√5-1)/(√5-1) = 2(√5-1)/(5-1) = 2(√5-1)/4 = (√5-1)/2\\n\\nSo s_5 = (√5 -1)/2 ≈ (2.236-1)/2=1.236/2=0.618\\n\\nNow, in triangle EIV, EI=1, EV=IV=s_5≈0.618\\n\\nBy law of cosines, angle at V: cos angle = (EV^2 + IV^2 - EI^2)/(2 * EV * IV) = (s_5^2 + s_5^2 - 1^2)/(2 s_5 s_5) = (2s_5^2 -1)/(2 s_5^2)\\n\\ns_5 = (√5 -1)/2, s_5^2 = [(√5 -1)/2]^2 = (5 -2√5 +1)/4 = (6 - 2√5)/4 = (3 - √5)/2\\n\\nThen 2s_5^2 = 2*(3 - √5)/2 = 3 - √5\\n\\n2s_5^2 -1 = 3 - √5 -1 = 2 - √5\\n\\n2 s_5^2 = 3 - √5\\n\\nSo cos angle = (2 - √5)/(3 - √5)\\n\\nRationalize or compute numerically: √5≈2.236, 2-2.236=-0.236, 3-2.236=0.764, so ≈ -0.236/0.764 ≈ -0.309, so angle about 108 degrees, which is correct for pentagon internal angle.\\n\\nBut the point is, given E and I, the set of points V such that |EV|=s_5, |IV|=s_5, is the intersection of two circles: circle center E radius s_5, circle center I radius s_5.\\n\\nSince |EI|=1 > |s_5 - s_5|=0, and < s_5 + s_5 ≈1.236, so two intersection points, symmetric with respect to the line EI.\\n\\nSo two possible positions for V.\\n\\nThen, once V is chosen, the pentagon can be completed: from V to E to N, etc.\\n\\nThe order: from E, after V, but in the sequence, from E it goes to N, not to V.\\n\\nThe adjacency: E is adjacent to V and N.\\n\\nSo from E, one neighbor is V, the other is N.\\n\\nSimilarly, I is adjacent to V and T.\\n\\nSo once V is fixed, then N is the other neighbor of E, and T is the other neighbor of I.\\n\\nIn the regular pentagon, once two adjacent vertices are fixed, the rest is determined, but here we have E and V fixed, which are adjacent, so yes, the pentagon is determined up to reflection, but since we have the order, it might be fixed.\\n\\nGiven E and V, adjacent, in a regular pentagon, there are two possible completions: one on each side.\\n\\nBut in this case, since we have the cyclic order specified, it might determine the orientation.\\n\\nThe sequence is V,E,N,T,I, so V to E to N, so from V to E, then to N.\\n\\nSo the turn at E.\\n\\nIn the pentagon, at vertex E, we come from V to E, then go to N.\\n\\nFor a regular pentagon, the turn is fixed: exterior angle 72 degrees? n=5, exterior angle 360/5=72 degrees.\\n\\nSo at E, we turn by 72 degrees (left for ccw, right for cw, but the magnitude is fixed).\\n\\nThe direction from V to E, then the direction to N is rotated by ±72 degrees.\\n\\nThe sign depends on the orientation of the pentagon.\\n\\nBut in the problem, the order V,E,N,T,I suggests a particular direction, say counter-clockwise.\\n\\nAssume that the vertices are listed in counter-clockwise order.\\n\\nThen at E, coming from V to E, then going to N, we turn left by 72 degrees (exterior angle).\\n\\nSo the vector from V to E, then rotate left 72 degrees to get the direction from E to N.\\n\\nThe magnitude is s_5.\\n\\nSo once V and E are fixed, the vector from E to N is determined: rotate the vector from V to E by 90 degrees? By 72 degrees counter-clockwise.\\n\\nRotation by 72 deg ccw.\\n\\nSimilarly for other points.\\n\\nSo for fixed E and V, and assuming ccw traversal, the point N is uniquely determined.\\n\\nSimilarly, from I, we can find T, but it should be consistent.\\n\\nNow, in our case, we have two choices for V (the two intersection points), and for each, if we assume ccw order, then N is determined.\\n\\nBut we also have the constraint that IN=1, but since it's a regular pentagon with diagonal 1, it should be satisfied automatically.\\n\\nMoreover, we need to make sure that the point N is consistent, but mainly, for each choice of V, we get a pentagon.\\n\\nNow, however, in the context of the plane, with the other points, but since no other constraints, both might be valid, as long as the pentagon doesn't intersect or something, but probably both are allowed.\\n\\nBut in this problem, likely both are considered, but we need to find ON, and see if it gives different values.\\n\\nBut first, recall that we have different configurations based on the square and hexagon orientations, giving different s, hence different positions for E and I.\\n\\nSpecifically, we have two cases for s:\\n\\nCase A: s = 1/(1+√3) = (√3 -1)/2\\n\\nCase B: s = 1/(√3 -1) = (√3 +1)/2\\n\\nFor each case, E and I are fixed (once we choose the orientations, but in each case, the relative position is fixed up to the choices we made, but for a given s, the distance EI is fixed, and the line EI is vertical in our coord, but the absolute position might matter for ON.\\n\\nIn our coordinate system, we have A(0,0), O(s,0), and I and E at (s, y_I) and (s, y_E), with y-coordinates depending on orientations.\\n\\nBut since the figure can be rotated and translated, but we have fixed A and O, and the edge AO, but the distance ON depends on O and N, and N will depend on the pentagon placement.\\n\\nMoreover, for each configuration of square and hexagon, we have fixed E and I, then for the pentagon, we have two choices for V, hence two possible N.\\n\\nBut in each case, we need to compute ON, and see what values we get.\\n\\nMoreover, since the sum or whatever, but the problem is to find the number of possible values of ON, given IN=1.\\n\\nSo we need to see how many distinct values ON can take.\\n\\nNow, let's compute for one case.\\n\\nFirst, take Case A: s = (√3 -1)/2\\n\\nAnd suppose we have the configuration where EI = s(1+√3) =1, as required.\\n\\nFor example, δ_s=1 (square ccw), δ_h=-1 (hexagon ccw), so I at (s,s), E at (s, -s√3)\\n\\nThen EI = |s - (-s√3)| = s(1+√3) = [(√3-1)/2] * (1+√3) = ? Compute: (√3-1)(1+√3)/2 = [√3*1 + √3*√3 -1*1 -1*√3]/2 = [√3 + 3 -1 - √3]/2 = (2)/2=1, good.\\n\\nNow, E(s, -s√3), I(s,s)\\n\\nNow, place pentagon with vertices V,E,N,T,I in ccw order.\\n\\nFirst, find V such that |EV|=s_5, |IV|=s_5, with s_5 = (√5 -1)/2\\n\\nAnd since ccw, and order V,E,N,T,I, so V is adjacent to E and I.\\n\\nThe two possible V: intersection of circle center E radius s_5, circle center I radius s_5.\\n\\nSince EI=1, and s_5≈0.618, as before.\\n\\nThe line EI is vertical, x=s, from y= -s√3 to y=s.\\n\\nMidpoint of E and I: y_m = [ -s√3 + s ] / 2 = s(1 - √3)/2\\n\\nx_m = s\\n\\nThe line joining E and I is vertical, so the perpendicular bisector is horizontal through midpoint.\\n\\nThe two points V are located such that they form equilateral? Isosceles triangle.\\n\\nThe distance from midpoint to V: by Pythagoras, in triangle, half of EI is 0.5, so distance d = sqrt( s_5^2 - (0.5)^2 ) = sqrt( [(√5-1)/2]^2 - 0.25 ) = sqrt( (5 -2√5 +1)/4 - 1/4 ) = sqrt( (6 -2√5)/4 - 1/4 ) = sqrt( (6 -2√5 -1)/4 ) = sqrt( (5 -2√5)/4 )\\n\\ns_5^2 = [(√5-1)/2]^2 = (5 -2√5 +1)/4 = (6-2√5)/4 = (3-√5)/2\\n\\nThen s_5^2 - (EI/2)^2 = (3-√5)/2 - (1/2)^2 = (3-√5)/2 - 1/4 = (6 - 2√5 -1)/4 = (5 - 2√5)/4\\n\\nSo d = sqrt( (5 - 2√5)/4 ) = (1/2) sqrt(5 - 2√5)\\n\\nNow, the direction: perpendicular to EI. Since EI is vertical, perpendicular is horizontal.\\n\\nSo V has x-coordinate s ± d, y-coordinate y_m = s(1 - √3)/2\\n\\nThe offset is in x-direction, since perpendicular to vertical line.\\n\\nSo V_x = s ± d, V_y = y_m = s(1 - √3)/2\\n\\nNow, d = (1/2) sqrt(5 - 2√5)\\n\\nNow, once V is chosen, we can find N.\\n\\nFrom E, in the pentagon, we come from V to E, then go to N.\\n\\nAssuming ccw traversal, we turn left by exterior angle 72 degrees.\\n\\nSo the vector from V to E, then rotate this vector by 72 degrees counter-clockwise to get the vector from E to N.\\n\\nThen N = E + (vector E to N)\\n\\nSimilarly, the magnitude should be s_5.\\n\\nNow, vector from V to E is E - V\\n\\nThen rotate by 72 deg ccw: rotation matrix [cos72, -sin72; sin72, cos72]\\n\\nCos72 = (√5 -1)/4, sin72 = sqrt(10 + 2√5)/4, but we can keep symbolic.\\n\\nNote that since the pentagon is regular, and we have E and V, the point N can be found as the next vertex.\\n\\nBut importantly, for each choice of V (left or right), we get a different N.\\n\\nThen we need distance from O to N.\\n\\nO is at (s, 0)\\n\\nN will be at some point, and we compute |O - N|\\n\\nNow, similarly for the other choice of V.\\n\\nMoreover, we have another case for s.\\n\\nBut notice that in this configuration, the setup is symmetric, but let's compute the values.\\n\\nHowever, there is a catch: in the pentagon, with the order V,E,N,T,I, and ccw, when we go from V to E to N, the turn should be consistent with the orientation.\\n\\nBut for each position of V, when we compute the vector, it might or might not give the correct turn, but since we are forcing the turn to be left 72 degrees, it should be ok.\\n\\nBut perhaps for one choice of V, the resulting pentagon might have crossing or something, but in regular pentagon, both should be valid.\\n\\nNow, the key point is that for a fixed E and I, the two possible V give two possible pentagons, and thus two possible N, and likely two different ON.\\n\\nBut in our case, we also have two different configurations for the square/hexagon (giving different s), so potentially up to 4 values, but some might coincide.\\n\\nMoreover, for each s-case, we have two N, so four values, but we need to see if ON is the same or not.\\n\\nBut also, in the s-case, we have different positions, so likely different.\\n\\nBut let's calculate numerically to see.\\n\\nFirst, compute constants:\\n\\n√2 ≈ 1.414, √3 ≈ 1.732, √5 ≈ 2.236\\n\\ns_5 = (√5 -1)/2 ≈ (2.236-1)/2 = 1.236/2 = 0.618\\n\\ns_5^2 = (3 - √5)/2 ≈ (3-2.236)/2 = 0.764/2 = 0.382\\n\\nFor Case A: s = (√3 -1)/2 ≈ (1.732-1)/2 = 0.732/2 = 0.366\\n\\nThen E_y = -s √3 ≈ -0.366 * 1.732 ≈ -0.634\\nI_y = s = 0.366  (since δ_s=1)\\nSo E(s, -0.634) = (0.366, -0.634)\\nI(0.366, 0.366)\\nMidpoint y_m = (-0.634 + 0.366)/2 = (-0.268)/2 = -0.134\\nHalf EI = 0.5\\nd = sqrt( s_5^2 - 0.25 ) = sqrt(0.382 - 0.25) = sqrt(0.132) ≈ 0.363\\nSo V_x = s ± d = 0.366 ± 0.363\\nSo V1: x≈0.366+0.363=0.729, y≈ -0.134\\nV2: x≈0.366-0.363=0.003, y≈ -0.134\\n\\nNow, take V1 (0.729, -0.134)\\nVector from V to E: E - V = (0.366 - 0.729, -0.634 - (-0.134)) = (-0.363, -0.5)\\nNow, rotate this vector by 72 deg ccw to get vector from E to N.\\nRotation 72 deg: cos72≈0.309, sin72≈0.951\\nSo new vector:\\ndx' = dx cos72 - dy sin72 = (-0.363)(0.309) - (-0.5)(0.951) = -0.112 + 0.4755 = 0.3635\\ndy' = dx sin72 + dy cos72 = (-0.363)(0.951) + (-0.5)(0.309) = -0.345 - 0.1545 = -0.4995\\nSo vector E to N ≈ (0.3635, -0.4995)\\nMagnitude sqrt(0.3635^2 + 0.4995^2) ≈ sqrt(0.132 + 0.2495) ≈ sqrt(0.3815) ≈ 0.618, good.\\nN = E + this vector = (0.366 + 0.3635, -0.634 -0.4995) ≈ (0.7295, -1.1335)\\nO is at (s,0) = (0.366, 0)\\nON = distance from (0.366,0) to (0.7295, -1.1335) = dx=0.7295-0.366=0.3635, dy= -1.1335 -0 = -1.1335\\nDist = sqrt(0.3635^2 + 1.1335^2) ≈ sqrt(0.132 + 1.285) ≈ sqrt(1.417) ≈ 1.190\\n\\nNow for V2: (0.003, -0.134)\\nVector V to E: (0.366 - 0.003, -0.634 - (-0.134)) = (0.363, -0.5)\\nRotate 72 deg ccw:\\ndx' = (0.363)(0.309) - (-0.5)(0.951) = 0.112 + 0.4755 = 0.5875?
