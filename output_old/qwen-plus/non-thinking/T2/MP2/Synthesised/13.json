  "math_problem": "The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to $k>0$, find $k$. Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition. A ladder is leaning against a house with its lower end $d$ feet from the house. When the lower end is pulled 9 feet farther from the house, the upper end slides 13 feet down. How long is the ladder (in feet)?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given a rectangle where the length $ L $ is three times the width $ w $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nL = 3w\\n$$\\n\\nThe perimeter $ P $ of a rectangle is:\\n\\n$$\\nP = 2(L + w) = 2(3w + w) = 2(4w) = 8w\\n$$\\n\\nThe area $ A $ is:\\n\\n$$\\nA = L \\\\cdot w = 3w \\\\cdot w = 3w^2\\n$$\\n\\nWe are told that the perimeter and area are numerically equal to the same value $ k > 0 $, so:\\n\\n$$\\n8w = 3w^2\\n$$\\n\\nSolve this equation:\\n\\n$$\\n3w^2 - 8w = 0 \\\\\\\\\\nw(3w - 8) = 0\\n$$\\n\\nSo $ w = 0 $ or $ w = \\\\frac{8}{3} $. Since $ w > 0 $, we take:\\n\\n$$\\nw = \\\\frac{8}{3}\\n$$\\n\\nNow compute:\\n\\n$$\\nd = w + \\\\frac{37}{3} = \\\\frac{8}{3} + \\\\frac{37}{3} = \\\\frac{45}{3} = 15\\n$$\\n\\nSo $ d = 15 $ feet.\\n\\nNow, a ladder is leaning against a house. Initially, the lower end is $ d = 15 $ feet from the house. Then it's pulled 9 feet farther, so the new distance from the house is:\\n\\n$$\\n15 + 9 = 24 \\\\text{ feet}\\n$$\\n\\nAt the same time, the upper end slides down 13 feet. Let’s suppose that initially, the top of the ladder reaches height $ h $ on the wall. After sliding, the height becomes $ h - 13 $.\\n\\nLet $ L $ be the length of the ladder (constant).\\n\\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\\n\\nInitially:\\n\\n$$\\nL^2 = 15^2 + h^2 = 225 + h^2\\n$$\\n\\nAfter moving:\\n\\n$$\\nL^2 = 24^2 + (h - 13)^2 = 576 + (h - 13)^2\\n$$\\n\\nSet them equal:\\n\\n$$\\n225 + h^2 = 576 + (h - 13)^2\\n$$\\n\\nExpand the right-hand side:\\n\\n$$\\n(h - 13)^2 = h^2 - 26h + 169\\n$$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n225 + h^2 = 576 + h^2 - 26h + 169\\n$$\\n\\nSubtract $ h^2 $ from both sides:\\n\\n$$\\n225 = 576 - 26h + 169\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n225 = 745 - 26h\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n26h = 745 - 225 = 520\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\nh = \\\\frac{520}{26} = 20\\n$$\\n\\nNow plug back to find $ L $:\\n\\n$$\\nL^2 = 15^2 + 20^2 = 225 + 400 = 625\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\nL = \\\\sqrt{625} = 25\\n$$\\n\\nSo the ladder is 25 feet long.\",\n    \"answer\": \"25\"\n}",
