  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Instead of determining the number of partitions of the set into pairs that form a single cell, simply find $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game. What is the probability that exactly $k$ games will need to be played to determine a winner?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-part problem that combines set theory, combinatorics, and probability. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the 2-configuration part\n\nWe are told:\n\n- A **consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell** consists of **exactly one pair**.\n- The pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a **partition** of the set $ A $.\n- Since there is **exactly one pair**, and the configuration forms a partition of $ A $, this means the entire set $ A $ must consist of **only those two elements in the pair**.\n\nTherefore, the set $ A $ must have exactly 2 elements.\n\nSo:\n$$\nn = 2\n$$\n\nNow we are to compute:\n$$\nk = n + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\n$$\n\nSo $ k = 7 $. This means we are to find the probability that **exactly 7 games** will be played in a best-of-9 series to determine a winner.\n\nNote: In a best-of-9 series, the first team to win 5 games wins. So the series ends when one team reaches 5 wins. The maximum number of games is 9, but the minimum is 5.\n\nWe are to compute the probability that **exactly 7 games** are played, meaning that the winning team gets their **5th win in the 7th game**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Best-of-9 series — Probability that exactly 7 games are played\n\nLet’s define:\n\n- The Mathletes have a probability $ p = \\frac{2}{3} $ of winning any single game.\n- The opponent has probability $ q = 1 - p = \\frac{1}{3} $.\n- The series ends when one team wins 5 games.\n- We want the probability that the series lasts **exactly 7 games**.\n\nFor the series to last exactly 7 games, **no team should have reached 5 wins before game 7**, and **one team wins the 7th game to get their 5th win**.\n\nSo after 6 games, the score must be:\n- Mathletes: 4 wins, Opponent: 2 wins → Mathletes win game 7\n- OR Mathletes: 2 wins, Opponent: 4 wins → Opponent wins game 7\n\nBecause if either team had 5 wins in 6 or fewer games, the series would have ended earlier.\n\nSo possible scenarios for going to 7 games:\n- Mathletes win 4 of first 6, then win game 7\n- Opponent wins 4 of first 6, then wins game 7\n\nWe compute both probabilities and add them.\n\n---\n\n#### Case 1: Mathletes win in 7 games\n\n- They win exactly 4 of the first 6 games: binomial probability\n$$\nP_1 = \\binom{6}{4} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2\n$$\nThen they win game 7: multiply by $ \\frac{2}{3} $\n\nSo total:\n$$\nP_{\\text{Mathletes win in 7}} = \\binom{6}{4} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}\n= \\binom{6}{4} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\binom{6}{4} = 15\n$$\n\nSo:\n$$\nP_1 = 15 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2\n$$\n\n---\n\n#### Case 2: Opponent wins in 7 games\n\n- Opponent wins exactly 4 of first 6 games: Mathletes win 2\n$$\nP_2 = \\binom{6}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^4\n$$\nThen opponent wins game 7: multiply by $ \\frac{1}{3} $\n\nSo:\n$$\nP_{\\text{Opponent win in 7}} = \\binom{6}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\n= \\binom{6}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^5\n$$\n\n$$\n\\binom{6}{2} = 15\n$$\n\nSo:\n$$\nP_2 = 15 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^5\n$$\n\n---\n\nNow compute total probability:\n$$\nP = P_1 + P_2 = 15 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^5 \\right]\n$$\n\nFactor:\n$$\nP = 15 \\left[ \\frac{2^5}{3^5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\frac{2^2}{3^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^5} \\right] = 15 \\left[ \\frac{32}{3^7} + \\frac{4}{3^7} \\right] = 15 \\cdot \\frac{36}{3^7}\n$$\n\nNow $ 3^7 = 2187 $\n\nSo:\n$$\nP = 15 \\cdot \\frac{36}{2187} = \\frac{540}{2187}\n$$\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 9:\n- $ 540 \\div 9 = 60 $\n- $ 2187 \\div 9 = 243 $\n\nSo $ \\frac{60}{243} $\n\nDivide by 3:\n- $ 60 \\div 3 = 20 $\n- $ 243 \\div 3 = 81 $\n\nSo $ \\frac{20}{81} $\n\nThus, the probability that exactly 7 games are played is $ \\frac{20}{81} $\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"20/81\"\n}",
