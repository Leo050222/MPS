  "math_problem": "Wendy eats sushi for lunch. She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, labeled as follows:\n\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} A & B & C \\\\ D & E & F \\\\ \\end{array}$\n\nwhere pieces are adjacent if they share a side (not counting diagonally), with adjacencies $A$-$B$, $A$-$D$, $B$-$C$, $B$-$E$, $C$-$F$, $D$-$E$, $E$-$F$. The pieces of sushi are distinguishable. She can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other remaining pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row. Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers randomly (and independently) chosen from the range $[0,1]$. Find the probability that $a$, $b$ and $k$ form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given a sushi grid labeled as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{ccc}\\nA & B & C \\\\\\\\\\nD & E & F \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{array}\\n$$\\n\\nAdjacencies (sharing a side):\\n- A-B, A-D\\n- B-C, B-E\\n- C-F\\n- D-E\\n- E-F\\n\\nSo the full adjacency list is:\\n- A: B, D\\n- B: A, C, E\\n- C: B, F\\n- D: A, E\\n- E: B, D, F\\n- F: C, E\\n\\nThis forms a graph with 6 vertices. We are told that Wendy eats sushi pieces one by one, and she can **only eat a piece if it is adjacent to at most two other remaining pieces**.\\n\\nBut the problem does **not** ask for the total number of valid eating orders.\\n\\nInstead, it says:\\n\\n> Find $ k = \\\\deg(F) + 0 $, where $ \\\\deg(F) $ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $ F $ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces **after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row**.\\n\\nThe two endpoint pieces of the top row are **A and C**.\\n\\nSo Wendy first eats A and C. The order doesn't matter for this intermediate step since we're just removing them.\\n\\nSo remove A and C from the graph. Remaining pieces: B, D, E, F.\\n\\nNow consider the induced subgraph on {B, D, E, F}.\\n\\nLet’s find the edges among these based on original adjacents:\\n- B was connected to A, C, E → only E remains → B-E\\n- D was connected to A, E → A gone → D-E\\n- E connected to B, D, F → all still present? B, D, F are in → so E-B, E-D, E-F\\n- F connected to C, E → C gone → only E-F\\n\\nSo edges in induced subgraph:\\n- B-E\\n- D-E\\n- E-F\\n\\nSo the connections are:\\n- B: E\\n- D: E\\n- E: B, D, F → degree 3\\n- F: E → degree 1\\n\\nSo $ \\\\deg(F) = 1 $ ⇒ $ k = \\\\deg(F) + 0 = 1 $\\n\\nNow, let $ a $ and $ b $ be real numbers chosen independently and uniformly from [0,1]. We are to find the probability that $ a $, $ b $, and $ k = 1 $ form the side lengths of an **obtuse triangle**.\\n\\nFirst, for three lengths to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality.\\n\\nLet the sides be $ a, b, 1 $. Without loss of generality, assume $ 1 $ is the longest side (we’ll check when this is true).\\n\\nBut $ a, b \\\\in [0,1] $, so $ a \\\\leq 1 $, $ b \\\\leq 1 $, so $ 1 $ is always the **largest** or tied for largest.\\n\\nFor a triangle to be formed:\\n- $ a + b > 1 $ (since $ a + 1 > b $ and $ b + 1 > a $ are automatically true because $ a, b \\\\leq 1 $, but $ a + b > 1 $ is non-trivial)\\n\\nSo triangle exists iff $ a + b > 1 $\\n\\nNow, for the triangle to be **obtuse**, the square of the longest side must be **greater** than the sum of squares of the other two.\\n\\nSince 1 is the longest side (or equal), the angle opposite side 1 is obtuse iff:\\n\\n$$\\n1^2 > a^2 + b^2 \\\\Rightarrow a^2 + b^2 < 1\\n$$\\n\\nBut we also need $ a + b > 1 $ for the triangle to exist.\\n\\nSo we want:\\n- $ a + b > 1 $\\n- $ a^2 + b^2 < 1 $\\n- $ a, b \\\\in [0,1] $\\n\\nWe compute the probability over the unit square $[0,1] \\\\times [0,1]$ of the region where:\\n\\n$$\\na + b > 1 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad a^2 + b^2 < 1\\n$$\\n\\nLet’s compute this area.\\n\\nTotal area of square: 1\\n\\nWe integrate over $ a \\\\in [0,1] $, $ b \\\\in [0,1] $\\n\\nDue to symmetry, we can compute the area where $ a + b > 1 $ and $ a^2 + b^2 < 1 $\\n\\nSketch:\\n- $ a + b = 1 $: line from (0,1) to (1,0)\\n- $ a^2 + b^2 = 1 $: quarter circle in first quadrant\\n\\nThe region $ a + b > 1 $ is above the line\\nThe region $ a^2 + b^2 < 1 $ is inside the quarter circle\\n\\nThe intersection of these two regions within the unit square is the segment of the disk above the line $ a + b = 1 $\\n\\nArea we want: $ \\\\iint_{a+b>1, a^2+b^2<1, a,b\\\\in[0,1]} da\\\\,db $\\n\\nBecause the quarter circle lies entirely within the square (for $ a,b \\\\geq 0 $), and the line $ a+b=1 $ cuts through it, we can compute:\\n\\nLet’s compute:\\n\\nArea = Area of quarter circle minus area of the part where $ a + b \\\\leq 1 $ and $ a^2 + b^2 < 1 $\\n\\nBut actually, better to compute directly the area above $ a+b=1 $ and inside $ a^2 + b^2 < 1 $\\n\\nWe can set up integral:\\n\\nFor $ a $ from 0 to 1:\\n\\nFind $ b $ such that $ b > 1 - a $ and $ b < \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2} $\\n\\nBut only when $ 1 - a < \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2} $\\n\\nNote: For $ a \\\\in [0,1] $, $ \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2} \\\\geq 1 - a $? Let's see when this holds.\\n\\nActually, $ \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2} \\\\geq 1 - a $ for $ a \\\\in [0,1] $, equality at 0 and 1.\\n\\nBut we need $ b > \\\\max(0, 1 - a) $ and $ b < \\\\min(1, \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2}) $\\n\\nBut since $ a \\\\in [0,1] $, $ 1 - a \\\\in [0,1] $, and $ \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2} \\\\leq 1 $, so upper bound is $ \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2} $\\n\\nLower bound: $ \\\\max(0, 1 - a) = 1 - a $ since $ a \\\\leq 1 $\\n\\nSo for each $ a \\\\in [0,1] $, the valid $ b $ interval is:\\n\\n$ b \\\\in (1 - a, \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2}) $ — but only if $ 1 - a < \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2} $\\n\\nWhen is $ 1 - a < \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2} $?\\n\\nSquare both sides (both non-negative for $ a \\\\in [0,1] $):\\n\\n$ (1 - a)^2 < 1 - a^2 $\\n\\n$ 1 - 2a + a^2 < 1 - a^2 $\\n\\n$ -2a + a^2 < -a^2 $\\n\\n$ 2a^2 - 2a < 0 $\\n\\n$ 2a(a - 1) < 0 $ ⇒ $ a \\\\in (0,1) $\\n\\nSo for $ a \\\\in (0,1) $, $ 1 - a < \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2} $, and at endpoints equality.\\n\\nSo the length of $ b $ interval is $ \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2} - (1 - a) $ for $ a \\\\in [0,1] $\\n\\nThus, area = $ \\\\int_0^1 \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2} - (1 - a) \\\\right) da $\\n\\nCompute:\\n\\n$ \\\\int_0^1 \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2} \\\\, da $: This is the area under the quarter circle of radius 1, which is $ \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} $\\n\\n$ \\\\int_0^1 (1 - a) \\\\, da = \\\\left[ a - \\\\frac{a^2}{2} \\\\right]_0^1 = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{1}{2} $\\n\\nSo area = $ \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} - \\\\frac{1}{2} $\\n\\nTherefore, the probability is $ \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} - \\\\frac{1}{2} $\\n\\nBut wait — is this correct?\\n\\nWait: No. The integral $ \\\\int_0^1 \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2} - (1 - a) \\\\right) da $ gives the area between the circular arc and the line $ a + b = 1 $, from $ a = 0 $ to $ a = 1 $, which is exactly the region where $ a + b > 1 $ and $ a^2 + b^2 < 1 $\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo the desired probability is:\\n\\n$$\\nP = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\n$$\\n\\nBut is this simplified?\\n\\nWe can write it as $ \\\\frac{\\\\pi - 2}{4} $\\n\\nEither way.\\n\\nBut let me double-check numerically:\\n- $ \\\\pi/4 \\\\approx 0.7854 $\\n- $ 1/2 = 0.5 $\\n- Difference ≈ 0.2854\\n\\nNow, area of quarter circle: ~0.7854\\nArea below $ a + b = 1 $ in square: triangle of area 0.5\\nBut the part of the quarter circle below $ a + b = 1 $ is less than 0.5\\nThe area we computed is the part of the disk above the line — about 0.2854\\nAnd since the total sample space is area 1, yes, this is the probability.\\n\\nSo final answer: $ \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi - 2}{4} $\\n\\nBut the problem says: “find the probability”\\n\\nSo answer is $ \\\\frac{\\\\pi - 2}{4} $\\n\\nBut let me confirm units: a and b are chosen from [0,1], uniform, independent. Yes.\\n\\nAnd k = 1, fixed.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo final answer is $ \\\\frac{\\\\pi - 2}{4} $\\n\\nBut let me write it neatly.\",\n    \"answer\": \"{\\\"answer\\\": \\\"(\\\\pi - 2)/4\\\"}\"\n}\n```",
