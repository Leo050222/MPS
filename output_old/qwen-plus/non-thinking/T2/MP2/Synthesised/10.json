All other outcomes are equally likely.\\n\\nWe are to compute the **expected number of rolls** it takes for Mark to roll **every number at least once**.\\n\\nThis is a variation of the **coupon collector problem** with a twist: no consecutive repeats.\\n\\nStandard coupon collector with $n=6$: expected time is $n H_n \\\\approx 6 \\\\cdot (1 + 1/2 + \\\\cdots + 1/6) \\\\approx 14.7$\\n\\nBut here, the die cannot roll the same number twice in a row. This affects the dynamics.\\n\\nHowever, note that this is a known variant. The key insight is that the constraint only prevents immediate repetition, but otherwise all other numbers are equally likely.\\n\\nLet’s model this as a **Markov process** with states representing the set of collected coupons (numbers seen so far), and also keeping track of the last rolled number (since next roll cannot be the same).\\n\\nBut this becomes complex. However, there is a known result or simplification when the transition is uniform over all other values.\\n\\nBut let's think carefully.\\n\\nActually, there is a known result: for a $n$-sided die with no two consecutive equal rolls, and all other transitions equally likely, the expected time to collect all $n$ coupons is still asymptotically similar to the standard coupon collector, but slightly less due to reduced chance of wasting rolls on repeats.\\n\\nBut perhaps we can simulate or reason step by step.\\n\\nAlternatively, notice that this setup is equivalent to a random walk on the complete graph $K_n$ with self-loops removed — i.e., at each step, you move uniformly to one of the other $n-1$ nodes.\\n\\nWe want the expected number of steps to visit all nodes starting from one.\\n\\nThis is the **cover time** of the complete graph $K_n$ without self-loops, under a random walk.\\n\\nFor the complete graph $K_n$ with self-loops, the cover time is known to be $n H_{n-1}$ approximately.\\n\\nBut without self-loops, and moving uniformly to other nodes, the analysis changes.\\n\\nHowever, there is a known result: the expected cover time for a random walk on the complete graph $K_n$ (without self-loops) is:\\n\\n$$\\nE[T] = (n-1) H_{n-1}\\n$$\\n\\nWait — let’s reconsider.\\n\\nActually, a paper or known exercise shows that the expected number of steps to visit all states in a random walk on $K_n$ (complete graph, no self-loops, uniform transition to others) is:\\n\\n$$\\nE[T] = n \\\\log n + (\\\\gamma/2)n + o(n)\\n$$\\n\\nBut that might not help.\\n\\nAlternatively, consider a recurrence.\\n\\nLet’s define $E(S, i)$ as the expected additional rolls to collect all numbers, given that we have already collected the set $S$ of numbers, and the last roll was $i$.\\n\\nBut this is too complex for manual computation.\\n\\nWait — perhaps there's a trick.\\n\\nI recall that for a $n$-sided die with no two consecutive equal rolls, the expected number of rolls to see all numbers is:\\n\\n$$\\nn H_n \\\\cdot \\\\frac{n}{n-1}\\n$$\\n\\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\\n\\nAlternatively, consider that after the first roll, each subsequent roll is uniformly distributed over the other $n-1$ values.\\n\\nSo the probability of getting a new number depends on how many we’ve already seen.\\n\\nLet’s try to model it as follows.\\n\\nLet $n = k = 6$\\n\\nLet $E(m, \\\\text{last})$ be the expected number of additional rolls needed to collect all 6 numbers, given that we have already collected $m$ distinct numbers, and the last roll was some number (which may or may not be in the collected set — it is).\\n\\nBut since we're collecting, “collected” means seen at least once.\\n\\nLet’s define $E(m)$ as the expected number of additional rolls to collect all $n$ coupons, given that we have $m$ distinct coupons collected, and the last roll was one of them.\\n\\nWe need to compute $E(0)$, but we start with no rolls. So first roll gives us one number.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n- Roll 1: get one number → now $m=1$, last = that number\\n\\nLet $E(m)$ be the expected additional rolls from this state.\\n\\nWe want $1 + E(1)$\\n\\nNow, suppose we have $m$ numbers collected, $n = 6$, and the last roll was one of them.\\n\\nOn the next roll, we choose uniformly among the other $n-1 = 5$ numbers.\\n\\nHow many of those are new?\\n\\nThere are $n - m$ uncollected numbers.\\n\\nBut among the $n-1$ possible next values, how many are new?\\n\\nThe last roll was one of the $m$ collected numbers.\\n\\nThe $n-1$ choices exclude the last number.\\n\\nAmong the remaining $n-1$ numbers:\\n\\n- $m - 1$ are other collected numbers (since one collected number is excluded — the last roll)\\n- $n - m$ are uncollected numbers\\n\\nSo probability of rolling a new number:\\n\\n$$\\np_{\\\\text{new}} = \\\\frac{n - m}{n - 1}\\n$$\\n\\nProbability of rolling an old (already collected) number:\\n\\n$$\\np_{\\\\text{old}} = \\\\frac{m - 1}{n - 1}\\n$$\\n\\nIf we roll a new number, we go to state $m+1$, and the last roll is that new number (so it's part of the new collected set).\\n\\nIf we roll an old number, we stay in state $m$, but the last roll is now that old number.\\n\\nSo the recurrence is:\\n\\n$$\\nE(m) = 1 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{n - m}{n - 1}\\\\right) E(m+1) + \\\\left(\\\\frac{m - 1}{n - 1}\\\\right) E(m)\\n$$\\n\\nSolve for $E(m)$:\\n\\n$$\\nE(m) - \\\\frac{m - 1}{n - 1} E(m) = 1 + \\\\frac{n - m}{n - 1} E(m+1)\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\nE(m) \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{m - 1}{n - 1}\\\\right) = 1 + \\\\frac{n - m}{n - 1} E(m+1)\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\nE(m) \\\\left(\\\\frac{n - 1 - (m - 1)}{n - 1}\\\\right) = 1 + \\\\frac{n - m}{n - 1} E(m+1)\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\nE(m) \\\\left(\\\\frac{n - m}{n - 1}\\\\right) = 1 + \\\\frac{n - m}{n - 1} E(m+1)\\n$$\\n\\nDivide both sides by $\\\\frac{n - m}{n - 1}$ (assuming $m < n$):\\n\\n$$\\nE(m) = \\\\frac{n - 1}{n - m} + E(m+1)\\n$$\\n\\nNice!\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nE(m) = E(m+1) + \\\\frac{n - 1}{n - m}\\n$$\\n\\nAnd $E(n) = 0$ (already collected all)\\n\\nSo we can compute backwards:\\n\\nLet $n = 6$\\n\\n$$\\nE(5) = E(6) + \\\\frac{5}{6 - 5} = 0 + \\\\frac{5}{1} = 5\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\nE(4) = E(5) + \\\\frac{5}{6 - 4} = 5 + \\\\frac{5}{2} = 5 + 2.5 = 7.5\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\nE(3) = 7.5 + \\\\frac{5}{3} \\\\approx 7.5 + 1.6667 = 9.1667\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\nE(2) = 9.1667 + \\\\frac{5}{4} = 9.1667 + 1.25 = 10.4167\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\nE(1) = 10.4167 + \\\\frac{5}{5} = 10.4167 + 1 = 11.4167\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\nE(0) \\\\text{ doesn't exist directly, but we start with first roll}\\n$$\\n\\nSo total expected number of rolls is:\\n\\n- First roll: get first number\\n- Then expected additional rolls: $E(1) = 11.4167$\\n\\nSo total: $1 + E(1) = 1 + 11.4167 = 12.4167$\\n\\nBut let's compute exactly.\\n\\nWe have:\\n\\n$$\\nE(m) = \\\\sum_{k=m}^{n-1} \\\\frac{n - 1}{n - k}\\n$$\\n\\nLet $j = n - k$, then as $k$ goes from $m$ to $n-1$, $j$ goes from $n - m$ down to 1.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nE(m) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n - m} \\\\frac{n - 1}{j} = (n - 1) H_{n - m}\\n$$\\n\\nYes! So:\\n\\n$$\\nE(m) = (n - 1) H_{n - m}\\n$$\\n\\nSo for $m = 1$, $n = 6$:\\n\\n$$\\nE(1) = 5 \\\\cdot H_{5} = 5 \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\right) = 5 \\\\left(\\\\frac{60 + 30 + 20 + 15 + 12}{60}\\\\right) = 5 \\\\left(\\\\frac{137}{60}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{685}{60} = \\\\frac{137}{12}\\n$$\\n\\nThen total expected number of rolls is:\\n\\n$$\\n1 + E(1) = 1 + \\\\frac{137}{12} = \\\\frac{12}{12} + \\\\frac{137}{12} = \\\\frac{149}{12}\\n$$\\n\\nSo the answer is $\\\\frac{149}{12}$\\n\\nBut let's double-check with earlier step-by-step:\\n\\n- $E(5) = 5/1 = 5$\\n- $E(4) = 5 + 5/2 = 7.5$\\n- $E(3) = 7.5 + 5/3 ≈ 9.1667$\\n- $E(2) = 9.1667 + 1.25 = 10.4167$\\n- $E(1) = 10.4167 + 1 = 11.4167 = 137/12 ≈ 11.4167$\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen total: $1 + 137/12 = 149/12$\\n\\nSo final answer is $\\\\frac{149}{12}$\",\n    \"answer\": \"149/12\"\n}",
