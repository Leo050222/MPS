Is 2 a perfect number?\\n  Divisors of 2: 1, 2. Sum of proper divisors: 1 ≠ 2 → not perfect. So f(2) is unknown for now.\\n\\n- f(3): last digit ≠ 4; proper divisors sum = 1 ≠ 3 → not perfect → f(3) unknown.\\n\\n- f(37): last digit is 7 → not 4; check if perfect: divisors are 1 and 37; sum of proper divisors = 1 ≠ 37 → not perfect → f(37) unknown.\\n\\nBut perhaps some composite factors of 1998 have last digit 4 or are perfect numbers.\\n\\nIdea: Use multiplicative property and try to express 1998 as product of numbers whose f-values are known to be 0.\\n\\nLet’s look at numbers with last digit 4. Maybe one of the factors or combinations ends in 4?\\n\\nWait — we can use the multiplicative property to break into any factors, not just primes.\\n\\nTry to find a factor of 1998 that ends in 4.\\n\\nList small factors of 1998:\\n1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 37, 54, 74, 111, 222, 333, 666, 999, 1998\\n\\nLook at last digits:\\n- 74 ends in 4 → so f(74) = 0\\n\\nIs 74 a factor of 1998? Yes, because 1998 ÷ 74 = ?\\n74 × 27 = 74 × 20 + 74 × 7 = 1480 + 518 = 1998 → yes!\\n\\nSo, 1998 = 74 × 27\\n\\nTherefore:\\nf(1998) = f(74) + f(27)\\n\\nNow, f(74) = 0 because last digit is 4.\\nf(27): last digit is 7 ≠ 4; is 27 perfect? Proper divisors: 1, 3, 9 → sum = 13 ≠ 27 → not perfect. So we don’t yet know f(27).\\n\\nBut 27 = 3³ → f(27) = 3·f(3)\\n\\nSo f(1998) = 0 + 3·f(3) = 3·f(3)\\n\\nNow can we find f(3)?\\n\\nTry to see if there's another way to factor 1998 such that both parts end in 4 or are perfect.\\n\\nAlternatively, suppose we can show f(n) = 0 for all n?\\nBut that might not be true unless forced.\\n\\nWait — what if we consider f(4)?\\n4 ends in 4 → f(4) = 0\\nBut 4 = 2×2 → f(4) = f(2)+f(2) = 2f(2) = 0 → f(2) = 0\\n\\nSimilarly, any number ending in 4 has f-value 0.\\n\\nWhat about 14? 14 ends in 4 → f(14)=0 → f(2)+f(7)=0 → since f(2)=0 ⇒ f(7)=0\\n\\nSimilarly, 24 → f(24)=0 → but 24 = 8×3 → f(8)+f(3)=0 → f(8)=f(2^3)=3f(2)=0 → so 0 + f(3)=0 ⇒ f(3)=0\\n\\nAh! This is promising.\\n\\nLet’s do that:\\nTake n = 24. Last digit is 4 → f(24) = 0\\n24 = 8 × 3 → f(24) = f(8) + f(3)\\nf(8) = f(2×2×2) = 3f(2)\\nf(2): from f(4) = f(2×2) = 2f(2) = 0 (since 4 ends in 4) → so f(2)=0 → f(8)=0\\nThen f(24) = 0 + f(3) = 0 ⇒ f(3) = 0\\n\\nGreat! So f(3) = 0\\n\\nThen f(27) = 3·f(3) = 0\\nThus f(1998) = f(74) + f(27) = 0 + 0 = 0\\n\\nAlternatively, earlier we had 1998 = 2 × 3³ × 37\\nf(1998) = f(2) + 3f(3) + f(37)\\nf(2)=0, f(3)=0, need f(37)\\n\\nCan we get f(37)=0?\\nFind a multiple of 37 that ends in 4.\\nTry: 37 × 2 = 74 → ends in 4 → f(74)=0\\n74 = 2 × 37 → f(74) = f(2) + f(37) = 0 + f(37) = 0 ⇒ f(37)=0\\n\\nPerfect!\\nSo f(2)=0, f(3)=0, f(37)=0 ⇒ f(1998)=0+0+0=0\\n\\nSo regardless of path, f(1998)=0\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 1: 0\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nA beaver walks from (0,0) to (4,4), only moving right (x+1) or up (y+1), and never visits a point (x,y) where y > x.\\n\\nThis is a classic Catalan-type path counting problem.\\n\\nTotal number of paths from (0,0) to (4,4) with steps (1,0) and (0,1) without crossing above the diagonal y=x.\\n\\nThis is the nth Catalan number, where n=4.\\n\\nCatalan number C_n = (1/(n+1)) * C(2n, n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n)\\n\\nC_4 = (1/5) * C(8,4) = (1/5) * 70 = 14\\n\\nWe can also list them or recall standard values:\\nC_0 = 1\\nC_1 = 1\\nC_2 = 2\\nC_3 = 5\\nC_4 = 14\\n\\nYes, 14 is correct.\\n\\nThe condition 'never goes to (x,y) with y>x' means the path stays on or below the diagonal y=x.\\n\\nThis is exactly the Dyck path condition, counted by Catalan numbers.\\n\\nSo number of such paths is 14.\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 2: 14\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"14\"\n}",
