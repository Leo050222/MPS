On Saturday, he starts at z and visits z^3, z^5, ..., z^2013 (odd powers from 3 to 2013). On Sunday, he starts at 1 and visits z^2, z^4, ..., z^2012 (even powers from 2 to 2012). The total distance traveled from the starting point to the last house is √2012 on both days.\\n\\nLet’s analyze this carefully.\\n\\nSaturday:\\n- Start: z\\n- End: z^2013\\n- Distance traveled: |z^2013 - z| = √2012\\n\\nSunday:\\n- Start: 1\\n- End: z^2012\\n- Distance traveled: |z^2012 - 1| = √2012\\n\\nSo we have two equations:\\n1. |z^2013 - z| = √2012\\n2. |z^2012 - 1| = √2012\\n\\nLet’s factor:\\nEquation 1: |z(z^2012 - 1)| = √2012 → |z| * |z^2012 - 1| = √2012\\nBut from equation 2, |z^2012 - 1| = √2012, so:\\n|z| * √2012 = √2012 ⇒ |z| = 1\\n\\nTherefore, z lies on the unit circle: |z| = 1 ⇒ z = e^(iθ) for some real θ.\\n\\nNow, since |z| = 1, then z̄ = 1/z, and |z^n| = 1 for all n.\\n\\nNow use equation 2: |z^2012 - 1| = √2012\\nBut |z^2012 - 1|^2 = (z^2012 - 1)(z̄^2012 - 1) = (z^2012 - 1)(z^{-2012} - 1)\\n= 2 - z^2012 - z^{-2012} = 2 - 2 Re(z^2012)\\n\\nSo |z^2012 - 1|^2 = 2 - 2 cos(2012θ) = 4 sin²(1006θ)\\nBut we know |z^2012 - 1|^2 = (√2012)^2 = 2012\\nSo:\\n4 sin²(1006θ) = 2012 → sin²(1006θ) = 503\\nBut sin²(x) ≤ 1, and 503 > 1 — contradiction?\\nWait! That can’t be. 4 sin²(x) = 2012 → sin²(x) = 503 → impossible.\\n\\nWait — this suggests an error.\\n\\nWait: |z^2012 - 1|^2 = (z^2012 - 1)(conj(z^2012) - 1)\\nSince |z| = 1, conj(z^2012) = z^{-2012}\\nSo:\\n|z^2012 - 1|^2 = (z^2012 - 1)(z^{-2012} - 1) = 2 - (z^2012 + z^{-2012}) = 2 - 2 Re(z^2012)\\nSo:\\n2 - 2 Re(z^2012) = 2012 → -2 Re(z^2012) = 2010 → Re(z^2012) = -1005\\nBut Re(z^2012) ≥ -1 because |z^2012| = 1 → Re(z^2012) ∈ [-1,1]\\n-1005 is not in [-1,1] → impossible?\\n\\nContradiction again. So where did we go wrong?\\n\\nWait — mistake: |z^2012 - 1| = √2012 → |z^2012 - 1|^2 = 2012\\nBut if |z| = 1, then |z^2012| = 1, so z^2012 lies on the unit circle. Then |z^2012 - 1| is the distance between a point on the unit circle and 1.\\nMaximum possible distance is 2 (when z^2012 = -1), so maximum |z^2012 - 1| = 2 → |z^2012 - 1|^2 ≤ 4\\nBut 2012 > 4 → impossible!\\n\\nThis is a serious problem.\\n\\nWait — but the problem says \\\"the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house\\\" is √2012.\\nOn Saturday: from z to z^2013 → |z^2013 - z|\\nOn Sunday: from 1 to z^2012 → |z^2012 - 1|\\nAnd both equal √2012 ≈ 44.85\\nBut as just shown, if |z| = 1, then |z^2012 - 1| ≤ 2, which is much less than 44.85.\\nSo unless |z| ≠ 1, but earlier we derived |z| = 1 from:\\n|z| * |z^2012 - 1| = √2012 and |z^2012 - 1| = √2012 → |z| = 1\\nBut that leads to contradiction.\\n\\nWait — let's double-check the derivation.\\nFrom Saturday: |z^2013 - z| = |z(z^2012 - 1)| = |z| * |z^2012 - 1|\\nGiven this equals √2012\\nFrom Sunday: |z^2012 - 1| = √2012\\nSo |z| * √2012 = √2012 → |z| = 1\\nYes, algebra is correct.\\nBut then |z^2012 - 1| = √2012 ≈ 44.85, but if |z| = 1, |z^2012| = 1, so |z^2012 - 1| ≤ |z^2012| + 1 = 2 < 44.85 → impossible.\\n\\nContradiction. So either the problem is flawed or our interpretation is wrong.\\n\\nWait — rereading: \\\"the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house\\\"\\nIs this the straight-line distance from start to end, or the total path length?\\nThe problem says: \\\"Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses.\\\" But the sentence after says: \\\"the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house\\\"\\nThis could mean the total walking distance along the path, not just the straight-line from start to end.\\nBut it says \\\"from his starting point to the last house\\\", which sounds like displacement, not total path.\\nBut that leads to contradiction.\\nAlternatively, maybe it means the total path length?\\nLet’s check the wording: \\\"the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house\\\"\\nIn common language, this could mean the total distance walked along the route.\\nFor example, \\\"distance from A to B via C\\\" means total path.\\nBut here it's a sequence: start at S, go to H1, H2, ..., Hn, and the distance from S to last house might mean total path.\\nMoreover, if it were just |end - start|, it would be strange to mention the intermediate stops.\\nAlso, the fact that both totals are √2012 suggests it's the total path length.\\nLet me assume that \\\"distance he must travel\\\" means the total length of the path he walks.\\n\\nSo redefine:\\n\\nSaturday:\\nStarts at z, goes to z^3, then z^5, ..., up to z^2013.\\nSequence: z → z^3 → z^5 → ... → z^2013\\nThe exponents: 1 (start), then 3,5,7,...,2013 (deliveries)\\nWait — does he deliver at z? The problem says: \\\"begins at z and delivers milk to houses located at z^3, z^5, ...\\\"\\nSo he starts at z, but first delivery is at z^3. So path: z → z^3 → z^5 → ... → z^2013\\nNumber of segments: from z^3 to z^2013 odd powers: 3,5,...,2013\\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with difference 2.\\nNumber of terms: (2013 - 3)/2 + 1 = 2010/2 + 1 = 1005 + 1 = 1006 deliveries? No:\\nFirst term 3, last 2013, n such that 3 + 2(n-1) = 2013 → 2(n-1)=2010 → n-1=1005 → n=1006\\nBut he walks from z to z^3 (first leg), then z^3 to z^5, ..., z^2011 to z^2013\\nSo number of legs = number of deliveries = 1006\\nBut the starting point is z, not a delivery.\\nSo total path: |z^3 - z| + |z^5 - z^3| + |z^7 - z^5| + ... + |z^2013 - z^2011|\\nSimilarly, Sunday: starts at 1, delivers to z^2, z^4, ..., z^2012\\nSo path: 1 → z^2 → z^4 → ... → z^2012\\nLegs: |z^2 - 1| + |z^4 - z^2| + |z^6 - z^4| + ... + |z^2012 - z^2010|\\nNumber of deliveries: 2,4,...,2012 → (2012-2)/2 + 1 = 2010/2 +1 = 1005 +1 = 1006 deliveries → 1006 legs\\nBoth have 1006 legs.\\nAnd total distance is √2012 for each day.\\n√2012 ≈ 44.85, and 1006 legs, so average leg length ~0.0446, plausible.\\nPreviously we had contradiction with displacement, but now with total path, no immediate contradiction.\\nSo let’s proceed under this interpretation: total path length is √2012 on each day.\\n\\nLet w = z^2\\nThen z^{k+2} - z^k = z^k (z^2 - 1) = z^k (w - 1)\\nSo |z^{k+2} - z^k| = |z^k| * |w - 1| = |z|^k * |w - 1|\\n\\nSaturday path:\\nSegments:\\n1. |z^3 - z| = |z| * |z^2 - 1| = |z| |w - 1|\\n2. |z^5 - z^3| = |z^3| |w - 1| = |z|^3 |w - 1|\\n3. |z^7 - z^5| = |z|^5 |w - 1|\\n...\\nLast segment: |z^2013 - z^2011| = |z|^{2011} |w - 1|\\nExponents of |z|: 1,3,5,...,2011\\nThis is an arithmetic sequence: first 1, last 2011, difference 2\\nNumber of terms: (2011 - 1)/2 + 1 = 2010/2 +1 = 1005 +1 = 1006\\nSum of Saturday distances:\\n|w - 1| * ( |z|^1 + |z|^3 + |z|^5 + ... + |z|^{2011} )\\nLet r = |z|, and s = r^2 = |z|^2 = |w|\\nThen the sum is |w - 1| * r * (1 + r^2 + r^4 + ... + r^{2010}) \\nBecause: r^1 + r^3 + ... + r^{2011} = r(1 + r^2 + r^4 + ... + r^{2010})\\nNumber of terms in parentheses: from r^0 to r^{2010} step 2 → exponent 0,2,4,...,2010 → (2010/2)+1 = 1006 terms\\nSum = r * (1 - (r^2)^{1006}) / (1 - r^2) = r (1 - r^{2012}) / (1 - r^2), for r^2 ≠ 1\\n\\nSimilarly, Sunday path:\\nSegments: |z^2 - 1|, |z^4 - z^2|, ..., |z^2012 - z^2010|\\n|z^{2k} - z^{2k-2}| = |z^{2k-2}| |z^2 - 1| = r^{2k-2} |w - 1|\\nFor k=1: |z^2 - 1| = r^0 |w - 1| = |w - 1|\\nBut wait: first segment is from 1 to z^2, so |z^2 - 1| = |w - 1|\\nSecond: |z^4 - z^2| = |z^2| |w - 1| = r^2 |w - 1|\\nThird: r^4 |w - 1|\\n...\\nLast: |z^2012 - z^2010| = r^{2010} |w - 1|\\nSo exponents: 0,2,4,...,2010 → same as above\\nSum = |w - 1| * (1 + r^2 + r^4 + ... + r^{2010}) = |w - 1| * (1 - r^{2012}) / (1 - r^2), for r^2 ≠ 1\\n\\nNow, Saturday total: |w - 1| * r * (1 - r^{2012}) / (1 - r^2)\\nSunday total: |w - 1| * (1 - r^{2012}) / (1 - r^2)\\nNote that 1 - r^2 = -(r^2 - 1), but since it's in denominator and same in both, ratio is fine.\\nLet S_sat = |w - 1| * r * (1 - r^{2012}) / (1 - r^2)\\nS_sun = |w - 1| * (1 - r^{2012}) / (1 - r^2)\\nSo S_sat / S_sun = r\\nBut we are told S_sat = S_sun = √2012\\nSo S_sat / S_sun = 1 ⇒ r = 1\\nSo |z| = 1\\nBack to unit circle.\\nBut earlier we thought this causes problem, but now with total path, let's see.\\nIf r = 1, then the sums need to be reevaluated because denominator 1 - r^2 = 0.\\nSo consider r = 1 case.\\nIf |z| = 1, then |z^k| = 1 for all k.\\nThen each segment length:\\nSaturday: |z^{k+2} - z^k| = |z^k| |z^2 - 1| = 1 * |w - 1| = |w - 1|\\nAnd there are 1006 segments, all of equal length |w - 1|\\nSo total Saturday distance: 1006 |w - 1|\\nSimilarly, Sunday: each segment |z^{2k} - z^{2k-2}| = |z^{2k-2}| |z^2 - 1| = 1 * |w - 1| = |w - 1|\\nNumber of segments: from 1 to z^2, z^2 to z^4, ..., z^2010 to z^2012\\nExponents: 0,2,4,...,2010 for the 'from' point, but number of legs: first delivery z^2, last z^2012, step 2 → number: (2012-2)/2 +1 = 1005 +1 = 1006\\nSo 1006 segments, each of length |w - 1|, so total Sunday distance: 1006 |w - 1|\\nSo both days: total distance = 1006 |w - 1|\\nSet equal to √2012:\\n1006 |w - 1| = √2012\\nSo |w - 1| = √2012 / 1006\\nCompute: √2012 = √(4*503) = 2√503\\n1006 = 2*503\\nSo |w - 1| = 2√503 / (2*503) = √503 / 503 = 1/√503\\nSo |w - 1| = 1/√503\\nNow w = z^2, and |z| = 1, so |w| = 1\\nSo w is on the unit circle, and |w - 1| = 1/√503\\nWe need to find Re(w) = Re(z^2)\\nLet w = e^{iφ}, then |w - 1|^2 = (cosφ - 1)^2 + sin^2φ = cos^2φ - 2cosφ + 1 + sin^2φ = 2 - 2cosφ\\nSo |w - 1|^2 = 2 - 2 Re(w)\\nWe have |w - 1| = 1/√503, so |w - 1|^2 = 1/503\\nThus:\\n2 - 2 Re(w) = 1/503\\n→ 2 Re(w) = 2 - 1/503 = (1006 - 1)/503 = 1005/503\\n→ Re(w) = 1005/(2*503) = 1005/1006\\nSo the real part of z^2 is 1005/1006\\nNow check if this makes sense.\\nRe(w) = 1005/1006 ≈ 0.999006, close to 1, and |w - 1| = sqrt(2 - 2*1005/1006) = sqrt(2(1 - 1005/1006)) = sqrt(2*(1/1006)) = sqrt(2/1006) = sqrt(1/503) = 1/sqrt(503), matches.\\nPerfect.\\nSo answer to Problem 1 is 1005/1006\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nBob's Rice ID number has six digits, each from 1 to 9 (no 0), and can repeat.\\nThe conditions:\\n- First 2 digits form a number divisible by 2\\n- First 3 digits form a number divisible by 3\\n- First 4 digits form a number divisible by 4\\n- First 5 digits form a number divisible by 5\\n- The entire 6-digit number is divisible by 6\\nWe need to count how many such numbers.\\nExample: 123252 works.\\n\\nLet the digits be d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6, each di ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}\\n\\nCondition 1: first 2 digits form number divisible by 2 → the number 10*d1 + d2 ≡ 0 mod 2 → d2 even.\\nSince d2 ∈ {1..9}, even digits: 2,4,6,8 → d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\n\\nCondition 2: first 3 digits form number divisible by 3 → sum d1+d2+d3 ≡ 0 mod 3\\n\\nCondition 3: first 4 digits form number divisible by 4 → a number is divisible by 4 iff its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\\nSo the number formed by d3 d4 must be divisible by 4, i.e., 10*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 4\\n\\nCondition 4: first 5 digits divisible by 5 → so the last digit of this 5-digit number, which is d5, must be 0 or 5. But digits are from 1 to 9, no 0, so d5 = 5\\n\\nCondition 5: entire 6-digit number divisible by 6 → must be divisible by 2 and 3.\\nDivisible by 2: last digit d6 must be even → d6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\nDivisible by 3: sum of all six digits ≡ 0 mod 3\\n\\nNow, we also have from condition 2: d1+d2+d3 ≡ 0 mod 3\\nAnd from condition 5: d1+d2+d3+d4+d5+d6 ≡ 0 mod 3\\nSubtract: (sum6) - (sum3) = d4+d5+d6 ≡ 0 mod 3\\nSo d4 + d5 + d6 ≡ 0 mod 3\\nBut d5 = 5, so d4 + 5 + d6 ≡ 0 mod 3 → d4 + d6 ≡ -5 ≡ 1 mod 3 (since -5 mod 3 = 1, as -5 + 6 =1)\\nSo d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3\\n\\nNow, we can build the number step by step.\\nWe know d5 = 5 (fixed)\\nd2 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\nd6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\nd1 ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}\\nd3,d4 ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. d2 even: already incorporated\\n2. d1+d2+d3 ≡ 0 mod 3\\n3. 10*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 4\\n4. d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3\\n5. d6 even: already incorporated\\n\\nWe can iterate over variables, but better to choose order that minimizes branching.\\nNotice d5 is fixed.\\nAlso, d2 and d6 are even digits.\\nConstraint 3 involves d3 and d4: 10*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 4\\nNote that 10*d3 + d4 ≡ 2*d3 + d4 mod 4? No.\\n10 ≡ 2 mod 4, so 10*d3 ≡ 2*d3 mod 4\\nBut d3 is integer, so 2*d3 mod 4 depends on d3.\\nIf d3 even, 2*d3 ≡ 0 mod 4 if d3 ≡ 0 mod 2? d3 even: d3=2,4,6,8 → 2*d3=4,8,12,16 ≡ 0 mod 4\\nIf d3 odd: d3=1,3,5,7,9 → 2*d3=2,6,10,14,18 ≡ 2 mod 4\\nSo:\\n- If d3 even, 10*d3 ≡ 0 mod 4\\n- If d3 odd, 10*d3 ≡ 2 mod 4\\nThen 10*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 4 iff:\\n- If d3 even: d4 ≡ 0 mod 4\\n- If d3 odd: 2 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 4 → d4 ≡ 2 mod 4\\nSo d4 must be divisible by 4 if d3 even, or d4 ≡ 2 mod 4 if d3 odd.\\nd4 ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}\\nNumbers ≡ 0 mod 4: 4,8\\n≡ 2 mod 4: 2,6\\nNote: 1≡1, 3≡3, 5≡1, 7≡3, 9≡1 mod 4, so only 2,4,6,8 are candidates, but specifically:\\n- If d3 even, d4 ∈ {4,8}\\n- If d3 odd, d4 ∈ {2,6}\\nSo d4 is always even, and restricted based on d3 parity.\\n\\nNow, we have d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3\\nd4 and d6 are both even digits from {2,4,6,8}\\nList them with their values mod 3:\\n2 mod 3 = 2\\n4 mod 3 = 1\\n6 mod 3 = 0\\n8 mod 3 = 2\\nSo:\\nd4 possibilities depend on d3, but in any case d4 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\nSimilarly d6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\n\\nNow, d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3\\nPossible pairs (d4,d6) mod 3:\\nWe need sum ≡1 mod 3\\nPossible combinations:\\n- d4≡0, d6≡1 → sum≡1\\n- d4≡1, d6≡0 → sum≡1\\n- d4≡2, d6≡2 → sum≡4≡1 mod 3\\nOther combinations give sum≡0 or 2.\\nSo allowed:\\nCase A: d4≡0, d6≡1 → d4=6 (only, since 6≡0), d6=4 (only, since 4≡1)\\nCase B: d4≡1, d6≡0 → d4=4 (≡1), d6=6 (≡0)\\nCase C: d4≡2, d6≡2 → d4∈{2,8} (both ≡2), d6∈{2,8} (both ≡2)\\n\\nSo possible (d4,d6) pairs:\\nA: (6,4)\\nB: (4,6)\\nC: (2,2),(2,8),(8,2),(8,8)\\nTotal 1+1+4=6 types, but with multiplicities.\\n\\nNow, d4 is constrained by d3:\\n- If d3 even, d4 ∈ {4,8}\\n- If d3 odd, d4 ∈ {2,6}\\n\\nNow, look at the cases:\\nCase A: d4=6\\nBut d4=6 only allowed if d3 is odd (since d4=6 ≡2 mod 4? Wait no: earlier we have d4 must be ≡0 mod 4 if d3 even, ≡2 mod 4 if d3 odd.\\n6 div 4 is 1*4=4, remainder 2, so 6≡2 mod 4, so d4=6 requires d3 odd.\\nSimilarly, d4=4≡0 mod 4, requires d3 even.\\nd4=2≡2 mod 4, requires d3 odd.\\nd4=8≡0 mod 4, requires d3 even.\\nSo:\\n- d4=6: requires d3 odd\\n- d4=4: requires d3 even\\n- d4=2: requires d3 odd\\n- d4=8: requires d3 even\\n\\nNow back to cases:\\nCase A: d4=6, d6=4\\nd4=6 → d3 must be odd\\nCase B: d4=4, d6=6\\nd4=4 → d3 must be even\\nCase C: d4∈{2,8}, d6∈{2,8}\\n- If d4=2, requires d3 odd\\n- If d4=8, requires d3 even\\n\\nSo in all cases, d3 parity is determined by d4 choice.\\n\\nNow, we also have the sum condition: d1+d2+d3 ≡0 mod 3\\nAnd d1,d2,d3 are chosen with d2 even, d3 as above, d1 any 1-9.\\n\\nStrategy: iterate over d3, d4, d6, d2, then d1, but better to group.\\nSince d5 is fixed, and the constraints link d3,d4,d6 via parity and mod 3, and d2,d6 are even, perhaps fix d3 first, which determines d4 possibilities, then d4 determines d6 possibilities from the cases, but actually d4 and d6 are linked by the sum mod 3 and the cases above.\\nBetter to consider the cases A,B,C for (d4,d6), and for each, determine allowed d3, then d2, then d1.\\n\\nCase A: d4=6, d6=4\\nThen d4=6 requires d3 odd\\nd3 ∈ {1,3,5,7,9}\\nNow, d6=4 fixed\\nNow, d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\nNow, constraint: d1+d2+d3 ≡0 mod 3\\nd1 ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}\\nFor fixed d2,d3, the number of d1 such that d1 ≡ - (d2+d3) mod 3\\nSince d1 ranges over 1-9, which includes all residues mod 3 equally? Let's see:\\nDigits 1-9: \\nResidue 0: 3,6,9 → three digits\\nResidue 1: 1,4,7 → three\\nResidue 2: 2,5,8 → three\\nEach residue class has exactly 3 digits.\\nSo for any required residue for d1, there are exactly 3 choices.\\nSo for each fixed d2,d3, there are 3 choices for d1.\\nNow, in this case, d3 has 5 choices (1,3,5,7,9), d2 has 4 choices (2,4,6,8), and for each such pair, 3 choices for d1.\\nd4 and d6 fixed in this case.\\nSo total for case A: 5 (d3) * 4 (d2) * 3 (d1) = 60\\nBut d4 and d6 are fixed, so no choice.\\nSo 60 numbers in case A.\\n\\nCase B: d4=4, d6=6\\nd4=4 requires d3 even → d3 ∈ {2,4,6,8} (4 choices)\\nd6=6 fixed\\nd2 ∈ {2,4,6,8} (4 choices)\\nFor each d2,d3, number of d1: 3 (as above)\\nSo total: 4 * 4 * 3 = 48\\n\\nCase C: d4∈{2,8}, d6∈{2,8}, and d4 + d6 ≡1 mod 3, but in this case we already have d4≡2, d6≡2 mod 3, sum≡4≡1 mod 3, so all combinations are allowed? Earlier we said d4∈{2,8}, d6∈{2,8}, all satisfy d4≡2, d6≡2 mod 3, so sum≡4≡1 mod 3, good.\\nBut d4 choice affects d3 parity.\\nSubcases:\\n- d4=2: requires d3 odd → d3∈{1,3,5,7,9} (5 choices)\\n- d4=8: requires d3 even → d3∈{2,4,6,8} (4 choices)\\nd6 can be 2 or 8, independently? Yes, since no further restriction.\\nSo we can split:\\nSubcase C1: d4=2, d6=2 or 8\\nd4=2 → d3 odd (5 choices)\\nd6: 2 choices (2 or 8)\\nd2: 4 choices\\nFor each d2,d3, d1: 3 choices\\nSo for this: 1 (d4=2) * 2 (d6) * 5 (d3) * 4 (d2) * 3 (d1) = 1*2*5*4*3 = 120\\nBut d4 is fixed to 2, so yes.\\nSubcase C2: d4=8, d6=2 or 8\\nd4=8 → d3 even (4 choices)\\nd6: 2 choices\\nd2: 4 choices\\nd1: 3 choices\\nSo: 1 * 2 * 4 * 4 * 3 = 96\\nTotal for case C: 120 + 96 = 216\\n\\nNow, total numbers: case A + B + C = 60 + 48 + 216 = 324\\n\\nBut is that all? We have d5=5 fixed, and all digits covered.\\nLet me verify with the example: 123252\\nd1=1,d2=2,d3=3,d4=2,d5=5,d6=2\\nCheck:\\n- d2=2 even: ok\\n- sum d1+d2+d3=1+2+3=6≡0 mod 3: ok\\n- first 4 digits: 1232, last two 32, 32÷4=8: ok\\n- d5=5: ok\\n- d6=2 even: ok\\n- sum all:1+2+3+2+5+2=15≡0 mod 3: ok\\n- d4+d6=2+2=4≡1 mod 3? 4 mod 3=1, yes\\nWhich case? d4=2, d6=2 → case C, subcase C1\\nd3=3 odd, d4=2: consistent\\nGood.\\n\\nNow, is there any overlap or missing constraint?\\nWe have used all conditions.\\nIn case C, when d4=2, d6 can be 2 or 8, both work as long as sum mod 3 is satisfied, which it is.\\nSimilarly for others.\\nTotal: 60 (A) + 48 (B) + 216 (C) = 324\\nBut let me double-check the counts.\\nCase A: d4=6, d6=4, d3 odd (5 choices:1,3,5,7,9), d2 any even (4 choices), d1: for each d2,d3, 3 choices → 5*4*3=60\\nCase B: d4=4, d6=6, d3 even (4 choices:2,4,6,8), d2:4, d1:3 → 4*4*3=48\\nCase C1: d4=2, d6=2 or 8 (2 choices), d3 odd (5), d2:4, d1:3 → 1*2*5*4*3=120\\nCase C2: d4=8, d6=2 or 8 (2), d3 even (4), d2:4, d1:3 → 1*2*4*4*3=96\\nC total: 120+96=216\\nSum: 60+48=108; 108+216=324\\n\\nIs d1 always free to choose 3 options? Yes, because the sum d1+d2+d3 ≡0 mod 3 fixes d1 mod 3, and there are 3 digits for each residue.\\nSimilarly, no other constraints on d1.\\nAlso, d5 is fixed to 5.\\nSo total 324.\\nBut let me confirm the number of choices.\\nAnother way: since d5=5 fixed.\\nd2,d6 in {2,4,6,8}\\nd4 depends on d3, but we can compute total possibilities.\\nNote that d3 determines d4's set: if d3 odd, d4∈{2,6}; if d3 even, d4∈{4,8}\\nBut in our cases, we have specific assignments.\\nWe can calculate total without cases.\\nBut our case division covers all possibilities for (d4,d6) that satisfy d4+d6≡1 mod 3 and the divisibility by 4 constraint via d3.\\nAnd we have ensured that d3 parity matches d4 requirement.\\nSo should be complete.\\nTotal 324.\\nBut is there any constraint we missed? The entire number divisible by 6 is covered by d6 even and sum≡0 mod 3, which we have via d4+d5+d6≡0 mod 3 and d5=5, leading to d4+d6≡1 mod 3, and we enforced that.\\nAnd the sum3≡0 mod 3.\\nSo yes.\\nAnswer should be 324.\\n\\nBut let me see if the example is included: in case C1, d4=2, d6=2, d3=3 (odd), d2=2, d1=1: yes, one possibility.\\n\\nSo final answers:\\nProblem 1: 1005/1006\\nProblem 2: 324\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1005/1006\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"324\"\n}",
