A triangulation of a convex n-gon divides it into (n - 2) triangles using (n - 3) diagonals that do not cross in their interiors.\\n\\nFor a convex 7-gon, the number of triangulations is given by the (n-2)nd Catalan number: C_{n-2} = C_5.\\n\\nThe nth Catalan number is: \\nC_n = (1/(n+1)) * binomial(2n, n)\\n\\nSo, C_5 = (1/6) * binomial(10,5) = (1/6) * 252 = 42.\\n\\nThus, there are 42 triangulations of a convex 7-gon.\\n\\nProblem 2: We are to determine if the product of two consecutive natural numbers can equal the product of two consecutive even natural numbers.\\n\\nLet the two consecutive natural numbers be: n and n+1. Their product is: n(n+1).\\n\\nLet the two consecutive even natural numbers be: 2k and 2k+2. Note: consecutive even numbers differ by 2. Their product is: 2k(2k+2) = 4k(k+1).\\n\\nWe want: n(n+1) = 4k(k+1)\\n\\nNote that n(n+1) is always even (product of two consecutive integers), and so is 4k(k+1), so parity is fine.\\n\\nBut we analyze whether such equality can hold for positive integers n, k.\\n\\nSuppose equality holds:\\nn^2 + n = 4k^2 + 4k\\n\\nMultiply both sides by 4 to complete the square:\\n4n^2 + 4n = 16k^2 + 16k\\n=> (2n+1)^2 - 1 = 4*(4k^2 + 4k) = 4*((2k+1)^2 - 1)\\nWait — better approach: rearrange:\\nn^2 + n - 4k^2 - 4k = 0\\n\\nTreat as quadratic in n:\\nn = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4(4k^2 + 4k))]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(16k^2 + 16k + 1)]/2\\n\\nFor n to be integer, discriminant must be a perfect square:\\nd = 16k^2 + 16k + 1 must be a perfect square.\\n\\nLet d = m^2, so:\\nm^2 = 16k^2 + 16k + 1\\n\\nWe check small values of k:\\n\\nk=1: 16+16+1=33 → not square\\nk=2: 64+32+1=97 → no\\nk=3: 144+48+1=193 → no\\nk=4: 256+64+1=321 → no\\nk=5: 400+80+1=481 → no\\nk=6: 576+96+1=673 → no\\nk=7: 784+112+1=897 → no\\nk=8: 1024+128+1=1153 → no\\nk=9: 1296+144+1=1441 → no\\nk=10: 1600+160+1=1761 → not square (√1761 ≈ 41.97, 42^2=1764)\\n\\nNote: 16k^2 + 16k + 1 = (4k+2)^2 - 3 = 16k^2 + 16k + 4 - 3 = yes.\\nSo m^2 = (4k+2)^2 - 3 → m^2 + 3 = (4k+2)^2\\nSo difference between two squares is 3: (4k+2)^2 - m^2 = 3\\n→ (4k+2 - m)(4k+2 + m) = 3\\n\\nFactor pairs of 3: (1,3) only (positive, since k,m >0)\\nSo:\\n4k+2 - m = 1\\n4k+2 + m = 3\\nAdd: 8k+4 = 4 → 8k = 0 → k=0\\nBut k=0 gives even numbers 0 and 2, but 0 is not a natural number (positive integer). So invalid.\\n\\nNo other factorizations (negative would give negative k or m).\\nThus, no solution in positive integers.\\nTherefore, the product of two consecutive natural numbers cannot equal the product of two consecutive even natural numbers.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"42\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"no\"\n}",
