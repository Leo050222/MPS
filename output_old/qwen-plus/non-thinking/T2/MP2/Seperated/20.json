But since $ n^2 + 7 > |7n - 3| $ for large $ n $, the fraction will be less than 1 in absolute value eventually, so only small $ n $ can make this rational and the whole expression integral.\\n\\nBut more precisely, since $ f(n) = n - \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $, for $ f(n) $ to be integer, $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $ must be rational, which it is, but must be such that the entire expression is integer. So $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $ must be a rational number, and since denominator divides numerator in the remainder term, we require:\\n\\\\[\\nn^2 + 7 \\\\mid 7n - 3\\n\\\\]\\nWait — actually from earlier:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7} = n - \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7}\\n\\\\]\\nSo for this to be integer, $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $ must be rational, which it is, but the denominator $ n^2 + 7 $ must divide $ 7n - 3 $ in the sense that the entire expression is integer. But since $ n $ is integer, $ n $ is integer, so we need:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}, \\\\text{ and } \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} \\\\text{ must be a rational number such that } n - \\\\text{it} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}\\n\\\\]\\nBut $ n $ is integer, so we just need $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q} $, which it is, but more importantly, $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $ must be a rational number whose value makes the whole thing integer — i.e., $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $ must be a rational number with denominator dividing into numerator when reduced, but since denominator is $ n^2 + 7 $, we need $ n^2 + 7 \\\\mid 7n - 3 $ as integers? Not exactly, because $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $ doesn't have to be integer, but the entire expression $ n - \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $ must be integer. Since $ n $ is integer, this means $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $ must be rational — it is — but more precisely, it must be a rational number such that when subtracted from $ n $, gives integer — so it must be rational with denominator dividing something, but easier: since $ n $ is integer, $ f(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} $ iff $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q} $ and the difference is integer — but again, since both numerator and denominator are integers, $ f(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} $ iff $ n^2 + 7 \\\\mid 7n - 3 $? No!\\n\\nWait: from\\n\\\\[\\nf(n) = n - \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7}\\n\\\\]\\nthen\\n\\\\[\\nf(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\iff \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z},\\n\\\\]\\nbecause $ n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} $. So yes! We need:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}\\n\\\\]\\nBut note: this fraction could be negative, but since $ f(n) $ is required to be **positive** integer, and $ n $ is positive, we’ll check positivity at the end.\\n\\nBut let's define:\\n\\\\[\\nd(n) = \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7}\\n\\\\]\\nWe need $ d(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} $, and then $ f(n) = n - d(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ $.\\n\\nBut $ d(n) = \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $, and for $ n \\\\geq 1 $, numerator $ 7n - 3 > 0 $, denominator always positive, so $ d(n) > 0 $, so $ f(n) = n - d(n) < n $. But we need $ f(n) > 0 $, so $ n > d(n) $.\\n\\nBut more importantly, since $ n^2 + 7 > 7n - 3 $ for large $ n $, $ |d(n)| < 1 $ eventually, so $ d(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} $ implies $ d(n) = 0 $ or maybe 1?\\n\\nBut $ d(n) = \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $. Let's see when this is an integer.\\n\\nSince $ n^2 + 7 > 7n - 3 $ for large $ n $, the fraction is less than 1, so the only possible integer values are 0 or possibly 1 for small $ n $.\\n\\nBut $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} = 0 \\\\Rightarrow 7n - 3 = 0 \\\\Rightarrow n = 3/7 $, not integer.\\n\\nSo $ d(n) \\\\neq 0 $ for integer $ n $.\\n\\nNow, $ d(n) \\\\geq 1 $ only if $ 7n - 3 \\\\geq n^2 + 7 $\\n\\\\[\\n7n - 3 \\\\geq n^2 + 7 \\\\Rightarrow 0 \\\\geq n^2 - 7n + 10 \\\\Rightarrow n^2 - 7n + 10 \\\\leq 0\\n\\\\]\\nSolve: roots of $ n^2 - 7n + 10 = 0 $ are $ n = \\\\frac{7 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{49 - 40}}{2} = \\\\frac{7 \\\\pm 3}{2} = 5, 2 $\\nSo $ n^2 - 7n + 10 \\\\leq 0 $ for $ n \\\\in [2,5] $\\n\\nSo only for $ n = 2,3,4,5 $ can $ d(n) \\\\geq 1 $\\n\\nFor $ n = 1 $: $ d(1) = \\\\frac{7-3}{1+7} = \\\\frac{4}{8} = 0.5 $\\n$ n=2 $: $ \\\\frac{14-3}{4+7} = \\\\frac{11}{11} = 1 $ → integer!\\n$ n=3 $: $ \\\\frac{21-3}{9+7} = \\\\frac{18}{16} = 1.125 $\\n$ n=4 $: $ \\\\frac{28-3}{16+7} = \\\\frac{25}{23} \\\\approx 1.087 $\\n$ n=5 $: $ \\\\frac{35-3}{25+7} = \\\\frac{32}{32} = 1 $ → integer!\\n$ n=6 $: $ \\\\frac{42-3}{36+7} = \\\\frac{39}{43} < 1 $\\n$ n=7 $: $ \\\\frac{49-3}{49+7} = \\\\frac{46}{56} < 1 $\\nAnd decreasing.\\n\\nSo only possible integer values of $ d(n) $ are at $ n=2 $ and $ n=5 $, where $ d(n)=1 $\\n\\nAre there any other $ n $ where $ d(n) $ is integer? For $ n>5 $, $ d(n) < 1 $ and positive, so only possible integer is 0, but $ 7n-3=0 $ not integer $ n $, so no.\\n\\nWhat about $ n=1 $? $ d(1)=0.5 $ not integer\\n$ n=3 $: 1.125 no\\n$ n=4 $: ~1.087 no\\n$ n=6 $: ~0.907 no\\n$ n=7 $: ~0.82 no\\n$ n=8 $: $ \\\\frac{56-3}{64+7}=\\\\frac{53}{71}<1 $\\n$ n=9 $: $ \\\\frac{63-3}{81+7}=\\\\frac{60}{88}=15/22<1 $\\n$ n=10 $: $ \\\\frac{70-3}{100+7}=\\\\frac{67}{107}<1 $\\nAll fractions less than 1 and not zero, so not integer.\\n\\nBut wait — could $ d(n) $ be negative integer? For $ n \\\\geq 1 $, $ 7n-3 \\\\geq 4 >0 $, so $ d(n)>0 $, so no.\\n\\nSo only candidates: $ n=2 $ and $ n=5 $\\n\\nCheck them:\\n\\nFor $ n=2 $:\\n$ \\\\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7} = \\\\frac{8 + 3}{4 + 7} = \\\\frac{11}{11} = 1 $ → positive integer ✓\\n\\nFor $ n=5 $:\\n$ \\\\frac{125 + 3}{25 + 7} = \\\\frac{128}{32} = 4 $ → positive integer ✓\\n\\nAny others?\\n\\nWait — what if $ n^2 + 7 $ divides $ n^3 + 3 $, but our algebra missed something?\\n\\nWe had:\\n$ \\\\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7} = n - \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $\\n\\nSo for this to be integer, $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $ must be rational — it is — but more precisely, since $ n $ integer, we need $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q} $, but for the difference to be integer, we need $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} $, as established.\\n\\nBut perhaps $ n^2 + 7 $ divides $ 7n - 3 $ in the sense that the fraction is rational, but we already checked all small $ n $, and for large $ n $, the fraction is less than 1 and positive, so cannot be non-zero integer.\\n\\nBut to be thorough, suppose $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} = k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} $\\nThen:\\n$ 7n - 3 = k(n^2 + 7) $\\n$ k n^2 - 7n + 7k + 3 = 0 $\\nThis is quadratic in $ n $, discriminant must be perfect square:\\n$ D = 49 - 4k(7k + 3) = 49 - 28k^2 - 12k $\\n$ D = -28k^2 -12k + 49 $\\nMust be non-negative perfect square.\\n\\nTry integer $ k $:\\n\\n$ k=0 $: $ D=49=7^2 $ → yes\\nThen equation: $ 0*n^2 -7n +0+3=0 \\\\Rightarrow -7n+3=0 \\\\Rightarrow n=3/7 $ not integer\\n\\n$ k=1 $: $ D = -28 -12 +49 = 9 =3^2 $ → yes\\nEquation: $ 1*n^2 -7n +7+3=0 \\\\Rightarrow n^2 -7n +10=0 \\\\Rightarrow (n-2)(n-5)=0 \\\\Rightarrow n=2,5 $ ✓\\n\\n$ k=-1 $: $ D = -28(1) -12(-1) +49 = -28 +12 +49 = 33 $ not square\\n\\n$ k=2 $: $ D = -28*4 -12*2 +49 = -112 -24 +49 = -87 <0 $\\n\\n$ k=-2 $: $ D = -28*4 -12*(-2) +49 = -112 +24 +49 = -39 <0 $\\n\\n$ k=3 $: even more negative\\n\\n$ k=-3 $: $ D = -28*9 -12*(-3) +49 = -252 +36 +49 = -167 <0 $\\n\\nSo only possible $ k $ with $ D \\\\geq 0 $ are $ k=0,1,-1 $\\nOnly $ k=1 $ gives integer $ n $: $ n=2,5 $\\n\\nThus only solutions: $ n=2,5 $\\n\\nNow check if $ f(n) $ is positive integer:\\nAs above: $ n=2 \\\\to 1 $, $ n=5 \\\\to 4 $, both good.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 1: $ n=2,5 $\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nFind all values of $ m $ such that the zeros of $ 2x^2 - m x - 8 $ differ by $ m - 1 $.\\n\\nLet the roots be $ r, s $. Then:\\nSum: $ r + s = \\\\frac{m}{2} $ (since for $ ax^2+bx+c=0 $, sum = $ -b/a $; here $ a=2, b=-m $, so sum = $ m/2 $)\\nProduct: $ r s = \\\\frac{-8}{2} = -4 $\\nDifference: $ |r - s| = m - 1 $ ?\\nBut the problem says \\\"differ by $ m-1 $\\\", which usually means $ |r - s| = m - 1 $, but sometimes could be signed. But difference is often absolute, but let's see.\\n\\nBut $ m-1 $ could be negative, but difference of zeros is non-negative if absolute, so probably $ |r - s| = |m - 1| $? But the problem says \\\"differ by $ m-1 $\\\", and $ m-1 $ might be negative, but difference is usually non-negative.\\n\\nHowever, in some contexts, “differ by” allows sign, but typically it's absolute difference.\\n\\nBut let's read: “the zeros ... differ by $ m-1 $”\\nIf $ m-1 $ is negative, and difference is positive, it can't be. So likely, they mean $ |r - s| = |m - 1| $, or perhaps $ r - s = m - 1 $, but that would depend on order.\\n\\nBetter to use the identity:\\n$ (r - s)^2 = (r + s)^2 - 4rs $\\n\\nSo:\\n$ (r - s)^2 = \\\\left( \\\\frac{m}{2} \\\\right)^2 - 4(-4) = \\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16 $\\n\\nNow, the difference is $ |r - s| $, so $ (r - s)^2 = (\\\\text{difference})^2 $\\n\\nThe problem says the zeros differ by $ m - 1 $, so likely:\\n$ |r - s| = |m - 1| $ or $ |r - s| = m - 1 $\\n\\nBut if $ m - 1 < 0 $, $ |r - s| = m - 1 $ impossible since left side ≥0.\\nSo probably either:\\nCase 1: $ |r - s| = m - 1 $, which requires $ m - 1 \\\\geq 0 $\\nOr Case 2: $ |r - s| = |m - 1| $\\n\\nBut the problem says “differ by $ m-1 $”, which in mathematical context often means the absolute difference equals that value, implying $ m-1 \\\\geq 0 $.\\n\\nTo be safe, let's assume $ |r - s| = |m - 1| $, but I think the intended meaning is $ |r - s| = m - 1 $, with $ m \\\\geq 1 $.\\n\\nBut let's see the equation.\\n\\nSet:\\n$ (r - s)^2 = (m - 1)^2 $\\nBecause whether it's absolute or signed, squaring removes ambiguity.\\n\\nIf the difference is $ m-1 $, meaning $ r - s = m-1 $ or $ s - r = m-1 $, then $ (r - s)^2 = (m - 1)^2 $\\nYes! Because $ |r - s| = |m - 1| $ would give $ (r-s)^2 = (m-1)^2 $, same thing.\\n\\nActually:\\nIf $ |r - s| = |m - 1| $, then $ (r-s)^2 = (m-1)^2 $\\nIf $ |r - s| = m - 1 $, then $ (r-s)^2 = (m-1)^2 $ only if $ m-1 \\\\geq 0 $, but if $ m-1 < 0 $, it's impossible, so in that case no solution, but squaring both sides assumes equality of squares.\\n\\nBut to avoid missing cases, set:\\n$ (r - s)^2 = (m - 1)^2 $\\nBecause the square of the difference is equal to the square of $ m-1 $, regardless of signs.\\n\\nBut is that correct?\\nSuppose the problem means $ |r - s| = m - 1 $. Then we must have $ m - 1 \\\\geq 0 $, and $ (r - s)^2 = (m - 1)^2 $\\nIf the problem means $ r - s = m - 1 $, same thing after squaring.\\nBut if it means $ |r - s| = |m - 1| $, then also $ (r - s)^2 = (m - 1)^2 $\\nSo in all interpretations, setting $ (r - s)^2 = (m - 1)^2 $ covers the possibilities, but we may get extraneous solutions where $ |r - s| = |m - 1| $, but if the problem intends $ |r - s| = m - 1 $, we need to ensure $ m - 1 \\\\geq 0 $\\n\\nBut let's proceed and check.\\n\\nSo we have:\\n$ (r - s)^2 = \\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16 $\\nAnd we set this equal to $ (m - 1)^2 $\\nSo:\\n$ \\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16 = (m - 1)^2 $\\n\\nSolve:\\nRight side: $ m^2 - 2m + 1 $\\nLeft: $ \\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16 $\\n\\nSo:\\n$ \\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16 = m^2 - 2m + 1 $\\n\\nMultiply both sides by 4:\\n$ m^2 + 64 = 4m^2 - 8m + 4 $\\n\\nBring all to one side:\\n$ 0 = 3m^2 - 8m + 4 - 64 $\\n$ 0 = 3m^2 - 8m - 60 $\\n\\nSolve quadratic:\\n$ m = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{64 + 720}}{6} = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{784}}{6} = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pm 28}{6} $\\n\\nSo:\\n$ m = \\\\frac{8 + 28}{6} = \\\\frac{36}{6} = 6 $\\n$ m = \\\\frac{8 - 28}{6} = \\\\frac{-20}{6} = -\\\\frac{10}{3} $\\n\\nNow check these.\\n\\nFirst, $ m = 6 $:\\nPolynomial: $ 2x^2 - 6x - 8 $\\nDivide by 2: $ x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 $\\nFactors: $ (x-4)(x+1)=0 $, roots 4, -1\\nDifference: $ |4 - (-1)| = |5| = 5 $\\n$ m - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 $ → equal ✓\\n\\nNow $ m = -10/3 $:\\nPolynomial: $ 2x^2 - (-10/3)x - 8 = 2x^2 + \\\\frac{10}{3}x - 8 $\\nMultiply by 3: $ 6x^2 + 10x - 24 $\\nDiscriminant: $ 100 + 4*6*24 = 100 + 576 = 676 = 26^2 $\\nRoots: $ \\\\frac{ -10 \\\\pm 26 }{12} $\\nSo: $ \\\\frac{16}{12} = \\\\frac{4}{3} $, and $ \\\\frac{-36}{12} = -3 $\\nDifference: $ |\\\\frac{4}{3} - (-3)| = |\\\\frac{4}{3} + 3| = \\\\frac{13}{3} $\\nNow $ m - 1 = -\\\\frac{10}{3} - 1 = -\\\\frac{13}{3} $\\nAbsolute difference is $ \\\\frac{13}{3} $, and $ |m - 1| = \\\\frac{13}{3} $, so $ |r - s| = |m - 1| $\\nBut does “differ by $ m-1 $” mean $ |r - s| = m-1 $? Here $ m-1 = -13/3 < 0 $, and difference is positive, so if interpreted as $ |r - s| = m-1 $, it would be false.\\nBut if interpreted as the difference is $ m-1 $ in value, but negative, doesn't make sense.\\nTypically, “differ by” refers to absolute difference.\\nIn many contexts, “the difference between a and b is c” means $ |a-b|=c $, with $ c \\\\geq 0 $.\\nHere, $ m-1 = -13/3 < 0 $, so it cannot be the difference.\\nTherefore, only $ m=6 $ should be accepted.\\nBut let's see the problem: “differ by $ m-1 $”\\nIf $ m-1 $ is negative, and difference is positive, they are not equal.\\nSo probably only when $ m-1 \\\\geq 0 $\\nThus for $ m=-10/3 $, $ m-1 < 0 $, so even though $ |r-s| = |m-1| $, it's not equal to $ m-1 $ unless $ m-1 \\\\geq 0 $\\nSo only $ m=6 $ satisfies $ |r-s| = m-1 $\\nBut in the equation we set $ (r-s)^2 = (m-1)^2 $, which includes both cases.\\nTo confirm, let's see if the problem might allow it.\\nSuppose the roots are $ r,s $, and $ r - s = m - 1 $\\nThen for $ m=-10/3 $, $ m-1 = -13/3 $\\nFrom earlier, roots are $ 4/3 $ and $ -3 $, so $ r - s $ could be $ 4/3 - (-3) = 13/3 $ or $ -3 - 4/3 = -13/3 $\\nAh! So if we take $ r = -3 $, $ s = 4/3 $, then $ r - s = -3 - 4/3 = -13/3 = m - 1 $\\nSo the difference (signed) is $ m-1 $\\nBut the problem says “differ by”, which might mean the absolute difference, or the signed difference?\\nIn mathematics, “the difference of the roots” can sometimes refer to $ r_1 - r_2 $, especially in formulas.\\nBut “differ by” often implies magnitude.\\nHowever, in this case, since it specifies “differ by $ m-1 $”, and $ m-1 $ is given, and we can assign order, perhaps both are acceptable.\\nBut typically, “the zeros differ by” means the absolute difference.\\nFor example, “two numbers differ by 5” means their difference is 5 in absolute value.\\nMoreover, if signed, it would be ambiguous which is subtracted from which.\\nBut in this case, since we can choose order, perhaps $ |r - s| = |m - 1| $ is intended.\\nBut the problem says “differ by $ m-1 $”, not “by $ |m-1| $”.\\nTo resolve, let's see if both satisfy the condition as stated.\\nFor $ m = -10/3 $, the roots are $ -3 $ and $ 4/3 $. The difference between them is $ | -3 - 4/3 | = | -13/3 | = 13/3 $, while $ m - 1 = -13/3 $, which is not equal to 13/3. So if “differ by” means the absolute difference, then $ 13/3 \\\\neq -13/3 $, so not satisfied.\\nHowever, if we interpret “the difference” as $ r_1 - r_2 $ for some ordering, then we can say the difference is $ -13/3 = m-1 $, so it differs by $ m-1 $.\\nBut this is ambiguous.\\nLooking back at the problem: “the zeros of $ 2x^2 - m x - 8 $ differ by $ m-1 $”\\nI think the intended meaning is that the absolute difference is $ m-1 $, implying $ m-1 \\\\geq 0 $.\\nIn many similar problems, it's absolute difference.\\nMoreover, in the first solution $ m=6 $, it works perfectly.\\nFor $ m=-10/3 $, $ m-1 < 0 $, and difference is positive, so cannot be equal.\\nTherefore, only $ m=6 $.\\nBut let's check if there are other interpretations.\\nPerhaps “differ by” means $ |r - s| = m - 1 $, so we need $ m - 1 \\\\geq 0 $.\\nIn that case, only $ m=6 $.\\nIf it meant $ |r - s| = |m - 1| $, then both would work, but the problem writes $ m-1 $, not $ |m-1| $.\\nFurthermore, in the answer, likely they expect $ m=6 $, or both.\\nBut let's see the calculation.\\nAnother way: let the roots be $ \\\\alpha, \\\\beta $, with $ \\\\alpha > \\\\beta $, then $ \\\\alpha - \\\\beta = m - 1 $\\nBut $ m-1 $ could be negative, but if $ \\\\alpha > \\\\beta $, $ \\\\alpha - \\\\beta > 0 $, so $ m-1 > 0 $\\nThen $ \\\\alpha - \\\\beta = m - 1 $\\nWe know $ \\\\alpha + \\\\beta = m/2 $\\n$ \\\\alpha \\\\beta = -4 $\\nAnd $ (\\\\alpha - \\\\beta)^2 = (\\\\alpha + \\\\beta)^2 - 4\\\\alpha\\\\beta = (m/2)^2 - 4(-4) = m^2/4 + 16 $\\nSet $ \\\\alpha - \\\\beta = m - 1 $, so:\\n$ (m - 1)^2 = \\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16 $\\nSame equation as before.\\nBut now, since $ \\\\alpha - \\\\beta = m - 1 > 0 $, we need $ m > 1 $\\nSo $ m = 6 $ satisfies, $ m = -10/3 \\\\approx -3.33 < 1 $, so $ m - 1 < 0 $, but $ \\\\alpha - \\\\beta > 0 $, contradiction.\\nTherefore, only $ m = 6 $\\nEven if we don't assume order, the difference $ |\\\\alpha - \\\\beta| = |m - 1| $, but the problem says “differ by $ m-1 $”, which likely means the value of the difference is $ m-1 $, so $ |\\\\alpha - \\\\beta| = m - 1 $, requiring $ m - 1 \\\\geq 0 $\\nHence only $ m=6 $\\nSo answer is $ m=6 $\\n\\nBut in some contexts, it might be both, but I think standard interpretation favors $ m=6 $\\nTo confirm, let's see if $ m=-10/3 $ is accepted.\\nSuppose $ m = -10/3 $, then $ m-1 = -13/3 $\\nThe roots are $ -3 $ and $ 4/3 $. The difference between them is $ 13/3 $ or $ -13/3 $ depending on order. If we say “they differ by $ -13/3 $”, it sounds odd because differences are usually non-negative. Moreover, in common language, “differ by a negative number” is unusual.\\nTherefore, only $ m=6 $ is valid.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: n = 2, 5\\nProblem 2: m = 6\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2,5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
