We need to compute $ \\\\frac{a}{b} $.\\n\\nStep 1: Simplify the nested radical $ \\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}} $.\\n\\nAssume that:\\n$$\\n\\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}} = \\\\sqrt{m} + \\\\sqrt{n}\\n$$\\nfor some rational numbers $ m, n $. Then squaring both sides:\\n$$\\n(\\\\sqrt{m} + \\\\sqrt{n})^2 = m + n + 2\\\\sqrt{mn} = 15 + \\\\sqrt{216}\\n$$\\nMatching rational and irrational parts:\\n- $ m + n = 15 $\\n- $ 2\\\\sqrt{mn} = \\\\sqrt{216} $\\n\\nSquare the second equation:\\n$$\\n4mn = 216 \\\\Rightarrow mn = 54\\n$$\\nNow solve the system:\\n- $ m + n = 15 $\\n- $ mn = 54 $\\n\\nThese are roots of the quadratic:\\n$$\\nx^2 - 15x + 54 = 0\\n$$\\nDiscriminant: $ 225 - 216 = 9 $, so:\\n$$\\nx = \\\\frac{15 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{9}}{2} = \\\\frac{15 \\\\pm 3}{2} \\\\Rightarrow x = 9 \\\\text{ or } 6\\n$$\\nSo $ m = 9, n = 6 $ (or vice versa).\\nThen:\\n$$\\n\\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}} = \\\\sqrt{9} + \\\\sqrt{6} = 3 + \\\\sqrt{6}\\n$$\\nBut this would mean $ a + \\\\sqrt{b} = 3 + \\\\sqrt{6} $, so $ a = 3 $, $ b = 6 $.\\nThus, $ \\\\frac{a}{b} = \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{1}{2} $.\\n\\nWait — check this:\\nIs $ (3 + \\\\sqrt{6})^2 = 9 + 6\\\\sqrt{6} + 6 = 15 + 6\\\\sqrt{6} $? But we have $ \\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}} $, not $ \\\\sqrt{15 + 6\\\\sqrt{6}} $.\\nWait — is $ \\\\sqrt{216} = 6\\\\sqrt{6} $?\\nYes: $ \\\\sqrt{216} = \\\\sqrt{36 \\\\cdot 6} = 6\\\\sqrt{6} $.\\nSo indeed:\\n$$\\n\\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}} = \\\\sqrt{15 + 6\\\\sqrt{6}}\\n$$\\nAnd we just showed:\\n$$\\n(3 + \\\\sqrt{6})^2 = 9 + 6 + 6\\\\sqrt{6} = 15 + 6\\\\sqrt{6}\\n$$\\nSo:\\n$$\\n\\\\sqrt{15 + 6\\\\sqrt{6}} = 3 + \\\\sqrt{6}\\n$$\\nTherefore:\\n$$\\na + \\\\sqrt{b} = 3 + \\\\sqrt{6} \\\\Rightarrow a = 3, b = 6\\n$$\\nHence $ \\\\frac{a}{b} = \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{1}{2} $.\\n\\nBut wait: is $ \\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}} = \\\\sqrt{15 + 6\\\\sqrt{6}} $? Yes.\\nAnd $ \\\\sqrt{15 + 6\\\\sqrt{6}} = 3 + \\\\sqrt{6} $? Let's square $ 3 + \\\\sqrt{6} $:\\n$ 9 + 6 + 6\\\\sqrt{6} = 15 + 6\\\\sqrt{6} $ → yes.\\nSo $ \\\\sqrt{15 + 6\\\\sqrt{6}} = 3 + \\\\sqrt{6} $ → correct.\\nSo $ a = 3, b = 6 $ → $ a/b = 1/2 $.\\n\\nBut the left side is $ a + \\\\sqrt{b} $, right side is $ 3 + \\\\sqrt{6} $, so $ a = 3, \\\\sqrt{b} = \\\\sqrt{6} \\\\Rightarrow b = 6 $. Correct.\\n\\nAnswer 1: $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nMark has a cursed six-sided die that never rolls the same number twice in a row. All other outcomes are equally likely. We want the expected number of rolls to see all six numbers at least once.\\n\\nThis is a variant of the coupon collector problem with a Markov constraint: no two consecutive rolls are equal.\\n\\nLet’s define states based on the set of numbers seen so far and the last roll.\\n\\nLet $ E(S, i) $ be the expected number of additional rolls needed to collect all numbers, given that current set of seen numbers is $ S $, and the last roll was $ i \\\\in \\\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\\\} $.\\n\\nWe want $ \\\\min_i E(\\\\{i\\\\}, i) $ averaged over initial roll? Wait — actually, first roll can be anything.\\n\\nBut since the process starts with no prior roll, the first roll is unconstrained. So:\\n- First roll: any number from 1 to 6, each with prob 1/6.\\nAfter that, transitions avoid repeating the previous number.\\n\\nWe can model this as a Markov chain with memory only of the last roll.\\n\\nLet $ E(S, i) $ = expected number of rolls to reach full set starting from having seen set $ S $, and last roll was $ i \\\\in S $.\\n\\nWe want:\\n$$\\nE = 1 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^6 \\\\frac{1}{6} E(\\\\{i\\\\}, i)\\n$$\\nBecause first roll takes 1 step, then we're in state $ (\\\\{i\\\\}, i) $ with prob 1/6.\\n\\nWe need to compute $ E(S, i) $ for all subsets $ S $ and $ i \\\\in S $.\\n\\nThis is complex but manageable with symmetry.\\n\\nUse symmetry: states depend only on size of $ S $ and whether $ i $ is in $ S $, but since $ i \\\\in S $ always, and due to symmetry among numbers, we can let:\\n\\nLet $ f(k, i) $ be expected time to finish when current set has size $ k $, last roll was $ i \\\\in S $, and by symmetry, it depends only on $ k $, not on which numbers or which $ i $, because all unseen numbers are symmetric.\\n\\nBut: when transitioning, the number of available choices depends on whether we roll a new number or old.\\n\\nLet $ E_k $ be the expected additional number of rolls to complete the collection given that we have already collected $ k $ distinct numbers, and we remember the last roll was one of them.\\n\\nWe want $ E_1 $ after first roll, so total expected rolls is $ 1 + E_1 $, but wait — after first roll, we have $ k=1 $, so yes.\\n\\nBut actually, the first roll gives us one number, so total expected rolls is $ 1 + E_1 $, where $ E_1 $ is expected additional rolls from state $ k=1 $.\\n\\nBut we need to define $ E_k $ carefully.\\n\\nAt state with $ k $ numbers seen, last roll was some number $ i $ (which is among the $ k $).\\nThe next roll: cannot be $ i $, so 5 possible values, each equally likely.\\nAmong these 5:\\n- Some correspond to numbers already seen (excluding $ i $): there are $ k - 1 $ such numbers\\n- Some correspond to unseen numbers: $ 6 - k $\\n\\nBut the 5 choices exclude $ i $, so:\\n- Number of seen numbers excluding $ i $: $ k - 1 $\\n- Number of unseen numbers: $ 6 - k $\\n- Total possible next rolls: $ 5 $\\n\\nSo probability next roll is new: $ \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} $\\nProbability next roll is old (but not $ i $): $ \\\\frac{k - 1}{5} $\\n\\nIf we roll a new number, we move to $ k+1 $, and the new last roll is that new number.\\nIf we roll an old number, we stay at $ k $, and the new last roll is that old number (still in the set).\\n\\nSo the recurrence:\\n$$\\nE_k = 1 + \\\\left( \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} \\\\right) E_{k+1}' + \\\\left( \\\\frac{k - 1}{5} \\\\right) E_k'\\n$$\\nBut here's the issue: after rolling, the state changes, but due to symmetry, $ E_k $ should represent the expected remaining time from *any* state with $ k $ numbers and last roll being one of them. Because of symmetry, this value depends only on $ k $, not on which numbers.\\n\\nSo let $ E_k $ be the expected additional rolls to finish from a state with $ k $ distinct numbers seen, and the last roll was one of them.\\n\\nThen:\\n$$\\nE_k = 1 + \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1} + \\\\frac{k - 1}{5} E_k\\n$$\\nWhy? Because:\\n- With prob $ \\\\frac{6-k}{5} $, we roll a new number → go to state with $ k+1 $ numbers, expected remaining $ E_{k+1} $\\n- With prob $ \\\\frac{k-1}{5} $, we roll an old number (not the last one) → remain in state with $ k $ numbers, but now last roll updated → expected remaining $ E_k $\\n- The '1' is for the current roll.\\n\\nNow solve for $ E_k $:\\n$$\\nE_k - \\\\frac{k - 1}{5} E_k = 1 + \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1}\\n$$\\n$$\\nE_k \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{k - 1}{5}\\\\right) = 1 + \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1}\\n$$\\n$$\\nE_k \\\\left( \\\\frac{5 - (k - 1)}{5} \\\\right) = 1 + \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1}\\n$$\\n$$\\nE_k \\\\left( \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} \\\\right) = 1 + \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1}\\n$$\\nAssuming $ k < 6 $, $ 6 - k \\\\ne 0 $, divide both sides by $ \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} $:\\n$$\\nE_k = \\\\frac{5}{6 - k} + E_{k+1}\\n$$\\nNice!\\nSo:\\n$$\\nE_k = E_{k+1} + \\\\frac{5}{6 - k}\\n$$\\nNow, base case: $ E_6 = 0 $, since we've seen all numbers.\\n\\nNow compute backwards:\\n- $ E_5 = E_6 + \\\\frac{5}{6-5} = 0 + \\\\frac{5}{1} = 5 $\\n- $ E_4 = E_5 + \\\\frac{5}{6-4} = 5 + \\\\frac{5}{2} = 5 + 2.5 = 7.5 $\\n- $ E_3 = E_4 + \\\\frac{5}{3} = 7.5 + 1.666... = 9.166... $\\n- $ E_2 = E_3 + \\\\frac{5}{4} = 9.166... + 1.25 = 10.416... $\\n- $ E_1 = E_2 + \\\\frac{5}{5} = 10.416... + 1 = 11.416... $\\n\\nNow total expected number of rolls is:\\nFirst roll: 1\\nThen we are in state $ k=1 $, so expected additional rolls: $ E_1 $\\nSo total: $ 1 + E_1 = 1 + 11.416... = 12.416... $\\n\\nCompute exactly:\\n$ E_5 = 5 = \\\\frac{5}{1} $\\n$ E_4 = 5 + \\\\frac{5}{2} = 5(1 + 1/2) $\\nBetter to write:\\n$ E_k = \\\\sum_{i=k}^{5} \\\\frac{5}{6 - i} $\\nFrom the recurrence $ E_k = E_{k+1} + \\\\frac{5}{6-k} $, so telescoping:\\n$ E_k = \\\\sum_{j=k}^{5} \\\\frac{5}{6 - j} $\\nLet $ m = 6 - j $, when $ j = k $, $ m = 6 - k $; $ j = 5 $, $ m = 1 $\\nSo:\\n$ E_k = \\\\sum_{m=1}^{6-k} \\\\frac{5}{m} = 5 \\\\sum_{m=1}^{6-k} \\\\frac{1}{m} $\\nYes!\\nSo $ E_k = 5 \\\\cdot H_{6-k} $, where $ H_n $ is the $ n $-th harmonic number.\\n\\nThus:\\n$ E_1 = 5 \\\\cdot H_{5} = 5 \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\right) $\\nCompute:\\n$ 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 $\\n$ + 1/3 ≈ 0.333 → 1.833 $\\n$ + 0.25 = 2.083 $\\n$ + 0.2 = 2.283 $\\nThen $ 5 \\\\times 2.283 = 11.416 $, as before.\\nExactly:\\n$ H_5 = \\\\frac{60 + 30 + 20 + 15 + 12}{60} = \\\\frac{137}{60} $\\nSo $ E_1 = 5 \\\\times \\\\frac{137}{60} = \\\\frac{685}{60} = \\\\frac{137}{12} $\\nThen total expected rolls: $ 1 + \\\\frac{137}{12} = \\\\frac{12}{12} + \\\\frac{137}{12} = \\\\frac{149}{12} $\\n\\nSo answer is $ \\\\frac{149}{12} $\\n\\nCheck:\\n$ \\\\frac{149}{12} \\\\approx 12.4167 $, matches.\\n\\nTherefore:\\nProblem 1: $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $\\nProblem 2: $ \\\\frac{149}{12} $\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"149/12\"\n}",
