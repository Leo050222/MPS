Alice and Bob play a game on a board consisting of one row of $k + 2021$ consecutive squares. They take turns placing tiles that cover two adjacent squares, with Alice going first. By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule. Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends; Bob's goal is to minimize it. What is the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure at the end of the game, no matter how Bob plays?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given a problem that combines number theory and game theory. First, we need to find the value of $ k $, which is defined as the part size in the solution with the smallest possible $ n $, derived from the structural consideration of minimal number of terms in the representation satisfying:\\n\\n1. $ k_1 + k_2 + \\\\cdots + k_n = 5n - 4 $\\n2. $ \\\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\\\frac{1}{k_2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{k_n} = 1 $\\n\\nWe are to minimize $ n $, then extract $ k $ — but note: the problem says 'find $ k $, where $ k $ is the part size in the solution with the smallest possible $ n $'. This suggests that among all solutions, we pick the one with minimal $ n $, and then take $ k $ as the common part size (possibly implying equal parts? Or perhaps a particular value?). But since it says 'the part size', this might suggest a uniform solution.\\n\\nLet’s suppose all $ k_i = k $. Then:\\n\\n- Sum: $ nk = 5n - 4 $ → $ k = 5 - \\\\frac{4}{n} $\\n- Reciprocal sum: $ \\\\frac{n}{k} = 1 $ → $ k = n $\\n\\nSo combining: $ k = n $, and $ k = 5 - \\\\frac{4}{n} $ → $ n = 5 - \\\\frac{4}{n} $\\nMultiply both sides by $ n $: $ n^2 = 5n - 4 $ → $ n^2 - 5n + 4 = 0 $\\nSolutions: $ n = \\\\frac{5 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{25 - 16}}{2} = \\\\frac{5 \\\\pm 3}{2} $ → $ n = 4 $ or $ n = 1 $\\n\\nCheck $ n = 1 $: then $ k_1 = 5(1) - 4 = 1 $, reciprocal sum $ \\\\frac{1}{1} = 1 $ → works. So $ (n=1, k_1=1) $ is a solution.\\n\\nBut is this the only one? And is it minimal $ n $? Yes, $ n=1 $ is minimal.\\n\\nThen $ k = k_1 = 1 $.\\n\\nBut wait: if $ n=1 $, $ k_1 = 5(1)-4 = 1 $, and $ 1/k_1 = 1 $, so yes, satisfies.\\n\\nSo $ k = 1 $.\\n\\nNow, the second part: Alice and Bob play on a board of $ k + 2021 $ squares. Since $ k = 1 $, the board has $ 1 + 2021 = 2022 $ squares.\\n\\nThey place tiles covering two adjacent squares. Each tile covers 2 squares. The game ends when no more such placement is possible. Alice wants to maximize the number of uncovered squares; Bob wants to minimize it. Alice goes first.\\n\\nWe are to find the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure, regardless of Bob's play.\\n\\nThis is a classic impartial game, similar to Kayles or domino tiling under adversarial conditions.\\n\\nTotal squares: 2022 (even).\\n\\nIf players cooperate to cover as much as possible, maximum covered is 2022, leaving 0. But they don’t cooperate.\\n\\nAlice wants to leave as many uncovered as possible; Bob wants to minimize that.\\n\\nEach move covers 2 squares. The game proceeds until no two adjacent uncovered squares remain.\\n\\nNote: the final state will have some isolated single squares that cannot be covered.\\n\\nThe key is to determine the guaranteed number of uncovered squares Alice can force, no matter how Bob plays.\\n\\nKnown result: In such games on a 1×N board, with players alternately placing dominoes (covering two adjacent squares), Alice trying to maximize uncovered squares, Bob minimizing, the outcome depends on parity and strategy.\\n\\nHowever, observe: every move covers exactly 2 squares. The total number of moves is at most $ \\\\lfloor N/2 \\\\rfloor $, but may be less due to fragmentation.\\n\\nBut here's a key insight: **the final number of uncovered squares is always congruent to $ N \\\\mod 2 $**, because each tile covers 2 squares. Since $ N = 2022 $ is even, uncovered squares must be even.\\n\\nMoreover, it's known from combinatorial game theory that in such adversarial tiling games, the outcome is often determined by pairing strategies.\\n\\nSuppose $ N $ is even. Can Bob force a complete tiling?\\n\\nNot necessarily, because Alice might create odd-sized gaps.\\n\\nBut actually, Alice moves first. Total number of dominoes that can be placed is at most 1011 (since 2022/2 = 1011). There are 1011 moves possible in a full tiling.\\n\\nSince Alice goes first, she makes move 1,3,5,..., so if all 1011 moves are made, Alice makes $ \\\\lceil 1011/2 \\\\rceil = 506 $ moves, Bob 505. But 1011 is odd → Alice makes one more move.\\n\\nBut Bob wants to minimize uncovered squares → he wants to maximize coverage.\\n\\nAlice wants to leave as many uncovered as possible → she may try to block the board early.\\n\\nHowever, there is a known result: in the adversarial domino covering game on a 1×N strip, with Alice maximizing and Bob minimizing the number of uncovered squares, the outcome is $ N \\\\mod 2 $ if both play optimally? No — because you can always leave at least 0 or 1.\\n\\nBut actually, for even $ N $, it's possible to tile completely — but can Alice prevent that?\\n\\nWait: Alice wants to *maximize* uncovered squares. So she may make moves that fragment the board into odd-sized regions, which cannot be fully tiled.\\n\\nFor example, placing a domino in the middle of an even-length board splits it into two odd-length boards. Odd-length boards cannot be fully tiled (since each tile takes 2), so each leaves at least one square uncovered.\\n\\nBut Bob may try to avoid such splits.\\n\\nActually, there is a well-known problem: on a 1×N board, two players alternately place dominoes. When no move is possible, the player who cannot move loses — but this is different.\\n\\nHere, it's not about winning, but about the number of uncovered squares.\\n\\nLet’s denote $ f(N) $ as the number of uncovered squares when both play optimally, Alice maximizing, Bob minimizing.\\n\\nWe want $ f(2022) $.\\n\\nKnown idea: the minimum number of uncovered squares in any maximal tiling of a 1×N board is $ N \\\\mod 2 $. But here, the tiling is not arbitrary — it's built incrementally, and players act strategically.\\n\\nBut Alice wants to *maximize* the number of uncovered squares in the final configuration, while Bob wants to *minimize* it.\\n\\nThis is a zero-sum game with value $ f(N) $.\\n\\nThere is a known result or pattern:\\n\\n- If a player can force the creation of many isolated cells, they can increase uncovered count.\\n\\nHowever, another idea: the total number of tiles placed is limited by the structure. The maximum number of uncovered squares possible in any maximal partial tiling of a 1×N board is $ N $ (if no tile is placed), but that's not achievable if players must move when possible.\\n\\nThe game ends when no two adjacent uncovered squares exist. That means the uncovered squares form an independent set — no two adjacent.\\n\\nSo the final uncovered squares are isolated.\\n\\nWhat is the maximum number of isolated squares that can remain? It's $ \\\\lceil N/2 \\\\rceil $, e.g., every other square. But can Alice force that?\\n\\nNo, because Bob will try to prevent that.\\n\\nBut Alice moves first.\\n\\nActually, consider a pairing strategy.\\n\\nSuppose Bob uses a pairing strategy: pair squares (1,2), (3,4), ..., (2021,2022). Whenever Alice plays on one pair, Bob can play on another, but Alice might break pairs.\\n\\nAlternatively, if Bob can mirror Alice’s moves, he might control the game.\\n\\nBut the board is linear, so mirroring is possible if symmetric.\\n\\nSuppose Bob uses a symmetry strategy: assume the board is symmetric, and Bob mirrors Alice’s move with respect to the center.\\n\\nBut 2022 is even, so center is between square 1011 and 1012.\\n\\nDefine reflection: position i ↔ 2023 - i.\\n\\nIf Alice places a domino covering (i,i+1), Bob responds by covering (2022-i, 2023-i) — symmetric domino.\\n\\nBut is this always possible? Only if the symmetric spot is free.\\n\\nInitially yes. After Alice’s first move, the symmetric spot is free, so Bob can play there.\\n\\nAfter that, as long as Alice plays in one half, Bob plays in the other.\\n\\nThis maintains symmetry.\\n\\nEventually, the game ends with a symmetric configuration.\\n\\nIn such a case, the number of uncovered squares must be even, and the tiling is symmetric.\\n\\nBut can Alice ever be forced to make the last move? Not necessarily.\\n\\nWith mirroring, Bob ensures that after his move, the position is symmetric. Therefore, whenever Alice has a move, its mirror is also a move, so Bob can respond. Thus, Bob never gets stuck before Alice. Therefore, Alice will eventually be unable to move, and Bob made the last move? No: Alice starts, so moves go A,B,A,B,..., and if Bob can always respond, then Alice runs out of moves first. So Bob makes the last move? No: if total possible moves is M, and Bob can always reply, then number of moves is even, Bob makes the last one.\\n\\nBut actually, after Bob’s response, symmetry is preserved. Any move Alice makes breaks symmetry locally, Bob restores it. The only way the game ends is when no move is possible — and due to symmetry, if there is a move on one side, there is one on the other. So the only way no move exists is globally.\\n\\nThus, Bob can ensure that the game continues as long as possible? No — Bob wants to minimize uncovered squares, so he wants to maximize coverage. So Bob prefers to fill as much as possible.\\n\\nAlice wants to leave many uncovered, so she might make moves that fragment the board.\\n\\nBut with Bob using a global mirror strategy, he ensures that the board remains symmetric, and thus no fragmentation occurs that isn't mirrored.\\n\\nCan Alice create an isolated segment? Suppose she plays near the center.\\n\\nFor example, suppose Alice plays at the center: covers squares 1011 and 1012.\\nThen the board is split into two segments: left of length 1010, right of length 1010.\\nBob now needs to respond. But the symmetric move would be... but the center is already taken. Where should Bob play?\\n\\nActually, after Alice plays at center, the board is symmetric already. Bob can play anywhere, say in the left half, then Alice can mirror? Wait, no — Bob wants to minimize uncovered, so he should continue filling.\\n\\nBut if Bob adopts mirroring, he must respond to Alice’s move in the opposite half. But if Alice played in the center, the move is self-symmetric. So Bob has no symmetric response — the spot is taken.\\n\\nSo Bob can treat this as a free move and play anywhere? But then symmetry is broken.\\n\\nTo maintain mirroring, Bob must require that non-central moves are mirrored. Central move (if any) is self-paired.\\n\\nBut in this case, Alice played the central domino — which is self-symmetric. Then Bob can play any move, and Alice can mirror it? But Alice wants to maximize uncovered, so she might not cooperate.\\n\\nActually, if Bob uses the mirror strategy, he can do the following: pair each possible domino position with its mirror. As long as Alice doesn’t play the central domino, Bob can mirror. If Alice plays the central domino, then Bob can take over and play arbitrarily, but still, the remaining board is symmetric.\\n\\nAfter central domino is placed, left and right are both 1010 squares, symmetric. Now Bob can adopt a new strategy: within each component, but since they are separate, Bob can mirror Alice’s move in the other component.\\n\\nThat is, if Alice plays in the left segment, Bob plays the symmetric move in the right segment, and vice versa.\\n\\nThus, Bob can still maintain symmetry between left and right.\\n\\nTherefore, Bob can ensure that the number of covered squares in left and right are equal.\\n\\nMoreover, within each 1010-length segment, the tiling proceeds with Alice moving first in that component? Not exactly — moves alternate globally.\\n\\nBut due to mirroring, for every move Alice makes in one half, Bob copies in the other. So if Alice keeps playing in one half, Bob fills the other. Eventually, one half may get fragmented.\\n\\nBut the key point is: Bob can ensure that the final configuration is symmetric, and thus the number of uncovered squares is even.\\n\\nBut more importantly, can Bob force a complete tiling?\\n\\nOnly if the total number of squares is even and no fragmentation prevents it.\\n\\nBut Alice can try to create odd-sized gaps.\\n\\nHowever, with Bob using mirroring, he prevents Alice from gaining advantage.\\n\\nActually, a known result in such games is that the second player can use a pairing strategy to ensure that at most 2 squares are left uncovered, or something similar?\\n\\nWait, let’s think smaller.\\n\\nTry small N:\\n\\nN=2: Alice places the only domino. Covers both. Uncovered = 0. So Alice cannot leave any uncovered. So f(2)=0.\\n\\nN=4: \\n- Alice can place in the middle: cover (2,3). Then left: square 1 and 4, not adjacent. Game ends. Uncovered = 2.\\n- Or Alice can place at end: cover (1,2). Then Bob can cover (3,4). Uncovered = 0.\\n\\nSo Alice chooses: if she places in middle, gets 2 uncovered; if at end, Bob can force 0. Since Alice wants to maximize, she will choose middle → 2 uncovered.\\n\\nCan Bob prevent that? No, because after Alice plays (2,3), no move is possible. So Bob cannot move. Game ends. So f(4)=2.\\n\\nBut is that right? After Alice covers (2,3), squares 1 and 4 are isolated, not adjacent, so no two adjacent uncovered squares → game ends. Yes. So 2 uncovered.\\n\\nSo Alice can force 2.\\n\\nN=6:\\nOptions for Alice:\\n- Play at end: (1,2). Then Bob can play (3,4), then Alice plays (5,6). All covered. Uncovered=0.\\n- Play (2,3): then board: [1], [4,5,6]. Bob can play (5,6). Then only square 1 and 4 left, not adjacent. Uncovered=2.\\n- Play (3,4) (center): splits into [1,2] and [5,6]. Bob can play, say, (1,2). Then Alice plays (5,6). All covered. Uncovered=0.\\n  But Bob could also, after Alice plays (3,4), play (1,2), then Alice plays (5,6). Still 0.\\n  But if Bob does nothing? No, Bob wants to minimize uncovered, so he will fill.\\n  So if Alice plays center, Bob can force 0.\\n- If Alice plays (2,3): leaves 1, and 4,5,6. Bob can play (5,6), leaving 1 and 4 → uncovered=2.\\n  Could Bob play (4,5)? Then leaves 1 and 6, still two uncovered.\\n  So Bob cannot do better than 2 in this line.\\n- Similarly, if Alice plays (1,2), Bob can play (3,4), Alice plays (5,6) → 0.\\n\\nBut Alice wants to maximize, so she will choose a move that gives at least 2. Playing (2,3) gives 2, playing (1,2) gives 0 if Bob plays well. So she chooses (2,3) or (4,5) → gets 2.\\n\\nCan she get more than 2?\\nSuppose after Alice plays (2,3), Bob is forced to leave two. Yes.\\nIs there a way to leave 4? Unlikely.\\nMaximum possible uncovered in maximal tiling is 3 (e.g., three isolated), but hard to achieve.\\nBut in this case, Alice can force 2.\\nSo f(6)=2.\\n\\nN=1: no move possible, uncovered=1. But Alice cannot move, so game ends immediately. But Alice goes first, but no move available? The game ends when no tile can be placed. Initially, if N<2, no move. But here N=2022>2.\\nBut for N=1, f(1)=1.\\n\\nN=3: possible moves: (1,2) or (2,3). Say Alice plays (1,2). Leaves square 3. Uncovered=1. Similarly if (2,3), leaves 1. So f(3)=1.\\n\\nN=4: as above, Alice can force 2.\\n\\nN=5: \\n- Alice can play (1,2): leaves [3,4,5]. Bob can play (3,4), leaves 5 → uncovered=2 (square 5 and? 1,2 covered, 3,4 covered, 5 uncovered → only 1 uncovered? Wait: squares: 1,2 covered; 3,4 covered; 5 uncovered. So one uncovered.\\n  Or Bob plays (4,5), leaves 3 → still one uncovered.\\n  So uncovered=1.\\n- Alice plays (2,3): leaves 1, and 4,5. Bob plays (4,5). Leaves 1 → uncovered=1.\\n- Alice plays (3,4): similar.\\n- Alice plays (1,2): as above, Bob can force only 1 uncovered.\\nCan Alice do better?\\nSuppose Alice plays (2,3): leaves 1 (isolated), and 4,5. Bob must play (4,5) (only move), then only 1 uncovered.\\nSimilarly for others.\\nSo best Alice can get is 1.\\nf(5)=1.\\n\\nN=7:\\nAlice wants to maximize.\\nSuppose Alice plays in center: (4,5). Splits into [1,2,3] and [6,7].\\nBob can play in [6,7]: (6,7). Then left [1,2,3]. Alice can play (1,2), leaves 3; or (2,3), leaves 1. Either way, one uncovered. Total uncovered: 1 (from left) + 0 (right) =1? No: right was covered, left has one uncovered. But square 3 or 1. So total uncovered=1.\\nBut Bob could instead play in the left? Same thing.\\nSuppose after Alice plays (4,5), Bob plays (1,2). Then left [3] and [6,7]. Alice plays (6,7). Leaves 3. Uncovered=1.\\nSame.\\nCan Alice play differently?\\nSuppose Alice plays (3,4). Then board: [1,2], [5,6,7].\\nBob can play (1,2). Then [5,6,7]. Alice can play (5,6), leaves 7; or (6,7), leaves 5. So one uncovered.\\nOr Bob plays (6,7), then [1,2] and 5. Alice plays (1,2), leaves 5. Uncovered=1.\\nStill 1.\\nSuppose Alice plays (2,3). Leaves 1, [4,5,6,7].\\nBob can play (5,6). Then [4], [7]? No: 4,5,6,7: if Bob plays (5,6), leaves 4 and 7, not adjacent. So uncovered: 1,4,7 → three uncovered? Wait: squares: 1 uncovered, 2,3 covered, 4 uncovered, 5,6 covered, 7 uncovered. Are 4 and 7 adjacent? No. So no two adjacent uncovered. So game ends. Uncovered: 1,4,7 → three squares.\\nOh! So if Alice plays (2,3), and Bob plays (5,6), then uncovered = 1,4,7 → 3.\\nBut Bob wants to minimize uncovered, so he would not play (5,6).\\nWhat can Bob do?\\nAfter Alice plays (2,3), uncovered: 1,4,5,6,7.\\nPossible moves: (4,5), (5,6), (6,7).\\nIf Bob plays (4,5), then leaves 1,6,7. Then Alice can play (6,7). Leaves 1. Uncovered=1.\\nIf Bob plays (6,7), then leaves 1,4,5. Alice can play (4,5). Leaves 1. Uncovered=1.\\nIf Bob plays (5,6), then as above, leaves 1,4,7 → three uncovered, and no move possible (4 and 7 not adjacent, 1 isolated). So game ends with 3 uncovered.\\nBut Bob wants to minimize, so he will choose to play (4,5) or (6,7), leading to only 1 uncovered, rather than 3.\\nSo Bob will play (4,5) or (6,7), and then Alice plays the remaining pair, leaving only 1 uncovered.\\nSo in this line, uncovered=1.\\nSimilarly for other openings.\\nCan Alice force more?\\nSuppose Alice plays (1,2). Then Bob can play (3,4), Alice plays (5,6), Bob plays (7)? No, only up to 7. After (1,2),(3,4),(5,6), square 7 left. Uncovered=1.\\nOr Bob could play differently, but likely leads to 1.\\nSo seems f(7)=1.\\n\\nBut earlier N=4: f(4)=2, N=6: f(6)=2.\\n\\nPattern:\\nN | f(N)\\n1 | 1\\n2 | 0\\n3 | 1\\n4 | 2\\n5 | 1\\n6 | 2\\n7 | 1\\n8 | ?\\n\\nTry N=8.\\nAlice wants to maximize.\\nSuppose Alice plays (4,5) (center). Splits into two 3-square segments: [1,2,3] and [6,7,8].\\nBob must play in one, say (1,2). Then Alice can play (7,8) in the other. Leaves 3 and 6. Uncovered=2.\\nIf Bob plays (2,3), same, leaves 1 and 6 or 8.\\nSo uncovered=2.\\nCan Alice do better?\\nSuppose Alice plays (3,4). Then board: [1,2], [5,6,7,8].\\nBob can play (1,2). Then [5,6,7,8]. Alice can play (6,7). Then leaves 5 and 8. Uncovered=2 (5 and 8, not adjacent).\\nOr if after Bob plays (1,2), Alice plays (5,6), then Bob plays (7,8). Covered all. Uncovered=0? But Alice wants to maximize, so she won't do that. She will play (6,7) to leave 5 and 8.\\nSo she can get 2.\\nIf Bob, after Alice's (3,4), plays elsewhere, say (6,7). Then board: [1,2], [5], [8]. Alice can play (1,2). Leaves 5 and 8. Uncovered=2.\\nSame.\\nSuppose Alice plays (2,3). Leaves 1, [4,5,6,7,8].\\nBob can play (4,5). Then [6,7,8]. Alice can play (7,8), leaves 6. Uncovered: 1 and 6 → 2.\\nOr Bob plays (7,8), then [4,5,6]. Alice plays (4,5), leaves 6. Uncovered: 1 and 6 → 2.\\nOr Bob plays (5,6), then leaves 1,4,7,8. Then Alice can play (7,8), leaves 1,4. Uncovered=2.\\nSo always 2.\\nCan Alice get 4?\\nSuppose she plays (1,2). Then Bob can play (3,4), Alice (5,6), Bob (7,8). All covered. 0.\\nSo she won't do that.\\nSo f(8)=2.\\n\\nBut N=4:2, N=6:2, N=8:2. For N>=4 even, is it 2?\\nN=2:0, exception.\\n\\nN=10:\\nAlice plays center: (5,6). Splits into two 4-squares: [1,2,3,4] and [7,8,9,10].\\nBob plays in one, say (1,2). Alice mirrors in other: (7,8). Then Bob plays (3,4), Alice plays (9,10). All covered? No: after Bob plays (3,4), Alice plays (9,10), but then no more moves. But all covered? Left: 1,2,3,4 covered; 5,6 covered; 7,8,9,10 covered. So 0 uncovered.\\nBut Alice wants to maximize, so she shouldn't mirror.\\nAfter Bob plays (1,2) in left, Alice could play (3,4) in left? But left is [1,2,3,4], after (1,2) covered, left [3,4]. Alice can play (3,4). Then left segment done. Right segment [7,8,9,10] untouched. Bob can play (7,8), then Alice (9,10). All covered. Still 0.\\nAlternatively, after Bob plays (1,2), Alice could play in the right, but not completing.\\nBut Bob can always complete.\\nSuppose after Alice plays (5,6), Bob plays (1,2). Now Alice instead of playing in left, plays (8,9) in right. Then board: left: [3,4], right: [7], [10].\\nThen Bob can play (3,4). Then covered: 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9. Uncovered: 7,10. Not adjacent. So uncovered=2.\\nAnd game ends.\\nSo Alice can force 2.\\nIf Bob, after Alice's (5,6), plays differently, say (2,3). Then Alice can respond similarly.\\nSo f(10)=2.\\n\\nIt seems that for even N >= 4, f(N) = 2, except N=2 gives 0.\\nBut N=2 is 0.\\n\\nIs there a way for Alice to force more than 2?\\nFrom the examples, no.\\nAnd Bob, if he plays well, can usually contain it to 2 or less.\\nBut in N=4,6,8,10, Alice can force 2, but not more.\\nFor N=2, she forces 0.\\n\\nBut what about larger N? Say N=100. Can Alice force only 2?\\nYes, by creating a gap in the middle or by playing to isolate.\\nBut actually, Alice can always play a move that splits the board into two parts, and then use a strategy to leave one uncovered in each, but it's tricky.\\n\\nFrom the pattern:\\n- If N is even and N > 2, then f(N) = 2\\n- If N is odd, f(N) = 1\\n- N=2: f(2)=0\\n\\nBut N=2022 is even and greater than 2, so f(2022)=2?\\n\\nBut earlier for N=4,6,8,10, we got 2.\\n\\nIs this always true?\\nThere is a known result: in the adversarial domino game on a 1×N board, the first player can always ensure at least 2 uncovered squares for N even, N>=4.\\nAnd the second player can ensure at most 2?\\nIn our calculations, yes.\\n\\nBut let's confirm with N=12.\\nAlice plays (6,7). Splits into two 5-squares.\\nEach 5-square, if played alone, would leave 1 uncovered (as f(5)=1), but now it's combined.\\nBob plays in one 5-segment, say left. He plays somewhere. Alice can focus on the other segment.\\nBut Bob might fill one segment completely? 5 is odd, so cannot be fully tiled. Maximum 2 tiles, leaving 1.\\nSimilarly for the other.\\nSo eventually, each segment will have at least one uncovered square.\\nSince the segments are separated, those two uncovered squares are not adjacent, so game ends with at least 2 uncovered.\\nCan there be more? Possibly, but Bob will try to minimize.\\nIn each 5-segment, optimal play leads to 1 uncovered (as per f(5)=1), so total 2.\\nAnd since the segments are independent, the total uncovered is sum.\\nSo if Alice splits into two odd-length segments, each will have at least one uncovered, so at least 2.\\nAnd Bob can ensure no more than 1 per segment, so total 2.\\nThus, f(12)=2.\\n\\nSimilarly, for any even N >=4, Alice can play at positions (N/2, N/2+1), splitting the board into two segments of length (N/2 - 1) and (N/2 - 1)? No.\\nBoard: 1 to N.\\nPlay domino covering (k,k+1).\\nIf she plays at (N/2, N/2+1), then left segment: 1 to N/2 -1, length = N/2 -1\\nRight segment: N/2+2 to N, length = N - (N/2+1) = N/2 -1\\nSo both of length L = N/2 -1\\nNow, N even, so N/2 integer, L = N/2 -1\\nFor N=4: L=2-1=1, which is odd.\\nEach segment length 1: cannot place any tile, so each has 1 uncovered. Total uncovered = 2 (plus the two covered by Alice's move). Squares: Alice covers two, each end has one uncovered → total uncovered=2. Matches.\\nFor N=6: L=3-1=2. Each segment length 2. Bob can play in one, say cover it. Then Alice can play in the other? But after Bob plays in left (covers the two), then right is still there, Alice can play there? But Alice already moved first, now it's Bob's turn, then Alice's turn.\\nSequence:\\n- Alice covers (3,4) → positions 3,4 covered.\\n- Left: [1,2], right: [5,6]\\n- Bob plays, say, (1,2)\\n- Then Alice plays (5,6)\\n- All covered. Uncovered=0.\\nOh! So for N=6, if Alice plays center, Bob can force 0.\\nBut earlier we said Alice can play (2,3) to force 2.\\nSo she shouldn't play center.\\nFor N=6, playing (2,3): covers 2,3. Leaves 1, and 4,5,6.\\nThen Bob must play in [4,5,6]. He can play (4,5), then Alice plays (6)? No, (6) alone. After (4,5), leaves 6. Uncovered: 1 and 6 → 2.\\nOr Bob plays (5,6), leaves 4. Uncovered: 1 and 4 → 2.\\nSo yes, 2.\\nIf she plays (3,4), center, Bob can force 0, so she avoids that.\\nSo her best is to play near the end to force 2.\\nSimilarly, for general even N>=4, she can play at (2,3), leaving 1 uncovered, and a segment of length N-3.\\nN-3 is odd (since N even), so that segment will have at least one uncovered square in any maximal tiling.\\nMoreover, since it's separated from square 1, the two uncovered squares (1 and one in the large segment) are not adjacent, so game may end with at least 2 uncovered.\\nCan Bob reduce it to 1? Only if he can cover all of the large segment, but it's odd-length, so impossible. At least one uncovered in the large segment.\\nPlus square 1, so at least 2.\\nAnd depending on play, possibly more, but Bob will try to minimize to 2.\\nIn the large odd segment, Bob can ensure only one uncovered (by optimal play), so total 2.\\nThus, Alice can force at least 2, and Bob can ensure at most 2, so f(N)=2 for even N>=4.\\nFor N=2, f(2)=0.\\n\\nNow, in our case, N = k + 2021 = 1 + 2021 = 2022, which is even and greater than 2.\\nTherefore, f(2022) = 2.\\n\\nSo the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure is 2.\\n\\nFinal answer is 2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2\"\n}",
