But this may not help directly.\\n\\nAlternatively, consider that $ P $ is degree 5, and its roots are $ z_j^2 $, where $ z_j $ are the five roots of $ f(z) = z^5 + 2004z - 1 $.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nP(x) = c \\\\prod_{j=1}^5 (x - z_j^2)\\n$$\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$$\\nP(1) = c \\\\prod_{j=1}^5 (1 - z_j^2), \\\\quad P(-1) = c \\\\prod_{j=1}^5 (-1 - z_j^2) = c \\\\prod_{j=1}^5 (-(1 + z_j^2)) = c (-1)^5 \\\\prod_{j=1}^5 (1 + z_j^2) = -c \\\\prod_{j=1}^5 (1 + z_j^2)\\n$$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \\\\frac{c \\\\prod (1 - z_j^2)}{-c \\\\prod (1 + z_j^2)} = - \\\\prod_{j=1}^5 \\\\frac{1 - z_j^2}{1 + z_j^2}\\n$$\\n\\nNow note:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1 - z_j^2}{1 + z_j^2} = \\\\frac{(1 - z_j)(1 + z_j)}{(1 + z_j^2)} \\\\quad \\\\text{not obviously helpful}\\n$$\\n\\nBut let’s consider whether the polynomial has symmetry.\\n\\nLook at $ f(z) = z^5 + 2004z - 1 $\\n\\nIt is **odd** in coefficients except the constant term. Specifically:\\n\\n$ f(-z) = -z^5 - 2004z - 1 = - (z^5 + 2004z) - 1 $\\n\\nNot symmetric.\\n\\nBut suppose $ z $ is a root: $ z^5 + 2004z = 1 $\\n\\nWhat about $ -z $? Then $ (-z)^5 + 2004(-z) = -z^5 - 2004z = -1 $\\n\\nSo $ -z $ satisfies $ w^5 + 2004w = -1 $\\n\\nSo roots come in a kind of antisymmetric pair with respect to sign flip and sign of RHS.\\n\\nBut our equation is fixed: $ z^5 + 2004z = 1 $, so only one side.\\n\\nHowever, perhaps we can consider whether the set $ \\\\{ z_j^2 \\\\} $ has any symmetry.\\n\\nNote that $ z_j^2 $ depends on $ z_j $, but squaring removes sign. However, since the original polynomial is not even or odd in a way that gives paired roots, we cannot assume pairing.\\n\\nBut here's an idea: instead of working with roots, try to construct $ P(x) $ such that $ P(z^2) = 0 $ whenever $ z^5 + 2004z = 1 $.\\n\\nSo eliminate $ z $ from the system:\\n\\n$$\\nz^5 + 2004z = 1, \\\\quad x = z^2\\n$$\\n\\nThen $ z = \\\\sqrt{x} $, but better to write in terms of $ x $.\\n\\nSince $ x = z^2 $, then $ z = \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{x} $, but we can express higher powers.\\n\\nFrom $ x = z^2 $, we get $ z^3 = z \\\\cdot x $, $ z^4 = x^2 $, $ z^5 = z \\\\cdot x^2 $\\n\\nSo plug into equation:\\n\\n$$\\nz^5 + 2004z = 1 \\\\Rightarrow z x^2 + 2004 z = 1 \\\\Rightarrow z(x^2 + 2004) = 1\\n$$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nz = \\\\frac{1}{x^2 + 2004}\\n$$\\n\\nBut also, $ x = z^2 $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nx = \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{x^2 + 2004} \\\\right)^2\\n$$\\n\\nMultiply both sides:\\n\\n$$\\nx (x^2 + 2004)^2 = 1\\n$$\\n\\nExpand:\\n\\n$$\\nx (x^4 + 2 \\\\cdot 2004 x^2 + 2004^2) = 1\\n\\\\Rightarrow x^5 + 4008 x^3 + 2004^2 x - 1 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nP(x) = x^5 + 4008x^3 + 2004^2 x - 1\\n$$\\n\\nIs this degree 5? Yes. And it vanishes when $ x = z^2 $ and $ z^5 + 2004z = 1 $. Perfect.\\n\\nSo we can take:\\n\\n$$\\nP(x) = x^5 + 4008x^3 + (2004)^2 x - 1\\n$$\\n\\nNote: This is a monic polynomial, and degree 5, and satisfied by $ x = z^2 $ for each root $ z $ of the original equation. Since there are 5 roots $ z $, and possibly repeated $ z^2 $, but generically this should be the minimal polynomial or a multiple, but since degree matches, and we get one equation, likely this is $ P(x) $.\\n\\nBut wait: from $ z(x^2 + 2004) = 1 $, we assumed $ z \\\\neq 0 $, which is fine, and derived $ x = z^2 $ implies $ x(x^2 + 2004)^2 = 1 $, so every such $ x = z^2 $ satisfies this degree 5 equation. So the polynomial:\\n\\n$$\\nP(x) = x(x^2 + 2004)^2 - 1 = x^5 + 4008x^3 + 2004^2 x - 1\\n$$\\n\\nhas exactly those $ x = z^2 $ as roots. Since it's degree 5 and there are 5 values of $ z $ (counting multiplicity), and assuming distinct $ z^2 $, this is the polynomial.\\n\\nSo we can use this $ P(x) $.\\n\\nNow compute:\\n\\n$$\\nP(1) = 1 + 4008 + 2004^2 \\\\cdot 1 - 1 = 4008 + 2004^2\\n$$\\n\\nThe $ +1 $ and $ -1 $ cancel.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nP(1) = 4008 + 2004^2\\n$$\\n\\nSimilarly:\\n\\n$$\\nP(-1) = (-1)^5 + 4008(-1)^3 + 2004^2 (-1) - 1 = -1 - 4008 - 2004^2 - 1 = - (4008 + 2 + 2004^2) = - (4010 + 2004^2)\\n$$\\n\\nNow compute the ratio:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \\\\frac{4008 + 2004^2}{ - (4010 + 2004^2) }\\n$$\\n\\nLet $ A = 2004^2 $, so:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{4008 + A}{ - (4010 + A) } = - \\\\frac{A + 4008}{A + 4010}\\n$$\\n\\nThis is not simplifying to a nice number unless we compute numerically.\\n\\nBut wait — is this correct?\\n\\nWait: we derived $ P(x) = x(x^2 + 2004)^2 - 1 $, but does this have degree 5? Yes.\\n\\nBut is it guaranteed that all five roots $ z $ give distinct $ z^2 $? Possibly not, but even if not, the algebraic derivation shows that any $ x = z^2 $ with $ z^5 + 2004z = 1 $ satisfies $ x(x^2 + 2004)^2 = 1 $, so $ P(x) = x(x^2 + 2004)^2 - 1 $ vanishes at all such $ x $. Since it's degree 5, and there are 5 such $ z $, hence 5 values $ x = z^2 $ (with multiplicity), this must be the polynomial (up to scalar). Since the problem says “there exists a polynomial”, we can take this one.\\n\\nBut is it monic? Yes. So we can use it.\\n\\nSo proceed.\\n\\nCompute:\\n\\n$ 2004^2 = (2000 + 4)^2 = 2000^2 + 2*2000*4 + 16 = 4,000,000 + 16,000 + 16 = 4,016,016 $\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$ P(1) = 4008 + 4,016,016 = 4,020,024 $\\n\\n$ P(-1) = -1 - 4008 - 4,016,016 - 1 = - (1 + 4008 + 4,016,016 + 1) = -4,020,026 $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \\\\frac{4,020,024}{-4,020,026} = -\\\\frac{4,020,024}{4,020,026}\\n$$\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2:\\n\\n$ = -\\\\frac{2,010,012}{2,010,013} $\\n\\nNo further simplification. But this is not an integer, and the problem seems to expect a simple answer.\\n\\nBut wait — did we make a mistake in constructing $ P(x) $?\\n\\nLet’s double-check the elimination step.\\n\\nWe had:\\n\\n$ z^5 + 2004z = 1 $\\n\\n$ x = z^2 $\\n\\nThen $ z^5 = z \\\\cdot z^4 = z \\\\cdot (z^2)^2 = z x^2 $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$ z x^2 + 2004 z = 1 \\\\Rightarrow z(x^2 + 2004) = 1 \\\\Rightarrow z = \\\\frac{1}{x^2 + 2004} $\\n\\nThen $ x = z^2 = \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{x^2 + 2004} \\\\right)^2 $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$ x = \\\\frac{1}{(x^2 + 2004)^2} \\\\Rightarrow x (x^2 + 2004)^2 = 1 $\\n\\nYes, correct.\\n\\nSo $ P(x) = x(x^2 + 2004)^2 - 1 = x^5 + 4008x^3 + 2004^2 x - 1 $\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nBut now, the ratio $ P(1)/P(-1) $ is very close to -1, but not exactly.\\n\\nBut the problem says “calculate the quotient” — maybe it's acceptable as a fraction?\\n\\nBut perhaps we missed something: the polynomial $ P $ is defined such that $ P(z^2) = 0 $ for each root $ z $ of $ z^5 + 2004z = 1 $. Our $ P(x) $ has degree 5 and vanishes at all such $ z^2 $, so it must be the minimal polynomial (assuming separable, etc.), so it's correct.\\n\\nBut wait — could there be multiple $ z $ giving same $ z^2 $? For example, if $ z $ and $ -z $ were both roots, but they are not: if $ z^5 + 2004z = 1 $, then $ (-z)^5 + 2004(-z) = - (z^5 + 2004z) = -1 \\\\ne 1 $, so $ -z $ is not a root. So all $ z_j $ are not symmetric, and likely $ z_j^2 $ are distinct. So 5 distinct roots, so $ P $ is degree 5, good.\\n\\nBut now, $ d = 1 $, so we need $ P(1)/P(-1) $, which we computed as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{4,020,024}{-4,020,026} = -\\\\frac{4020024}{4020026}\\n$$\\n\\nBut simplify:\\n\\nLet $ a = 4020024 $, $ b = 4020026 $, $ b = a + 2 $\\n\\nSo $ -a/(a+2) $\\n\\nCan we reduce $ a/(a+2) $? gcd(a, a+2) = gcd(a,2)\\n\\na = 4020024 is even, so gcd = 2\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$ \\\\frac{a}{a+2} = \\\\frac{4020024}{4020026} = \\\\frac{2010012}{2010013} $\\n\\nAnd 2010013 is odd, so coprime numerator and denominator.\\n\\nSo ratio is $ -\\\\frac{2010012}{2010013} $\\n\\nBut this seems ugly for a final answer.\\n\\nWait — perhaps I made a calculation error.\\n\\nRecall:\\n\\n$ P(1) = 1^5 + 4008*(1)^3 + 2004^2 *1 - 1 = 1 + 4008 + 2004^2 - 1 = 4008 + 2004^2 $\\n\\nYes, the 1 and -1 cancel.\\n\\n$ 2004^2 = (2000+4)^2 = 4,000,000 + 16,000 + 16 = 4,016,016 $\\n\\nThen $ P(1) = 4,016,016 + 4,008 = 4,020,024 $ ✅\\n\\n$ P(-1) = (-1)^5 + 4008*(-1)^3 + 2004^2*(-1) - 1 = -1 - 4008 - 4,016,016 - 1 = - (1 + 4008 + 4,016,016 + 1) = -4,020,026 $ ✅\\n\\nSo $ P(1)/P(-1) = 4,020,024 / (-4,020,026) = -4020024/4020026 $\\n\\nBut wait — is this really the answer? The problem might expect a simple answer, like -1 or 1.\\n\\nPerhaps I misunderstood the construction.\\n\\nAlternative idea: maybe $ P(x) $ is the **minimal polynomial** of $ z^2 $, but if the extension degree is less, but unlikely.\\n\\nOr perhaps the polynomial is defined to have rational coefficients and be monic, but our $ P(x) $ is fine.\\n\\nWait — another thought: when we derived $ x(x^2 + 2004)^2 = 1 $, this is a necessary condition, but is it sufficient? That is, for each solution $ x $ of this equation, is there a corresponding $ z $ with $ z^2 = x $ and $ z^5 + 2004z = 1 $? Not necessarily — because from $ z = 1/(x^2 + 2004) $, and $ x = z^2 $, so consistency requires that $ z = 1/(z^4 + 2004) $, which is what we solved.\\n\\nBut the equation $ x(x^2 + 2004)^2 = 1 $ is degree 5, so 5 solutions. The original $ z $-equation is degree 5, so 5 solutions. Each $ z $ gives one $ x = z^2 $, so 5 values. So the map $ z \\\\mapsto z^2 $ is from 5 points to 5 points, so likely injective in this case (since $ -z $ not a root), so 5 distinct $ x $, so the polynomial is correct.\\n\\nSo the computation seems correct.\\n\\nBut the problem says “calculate the quotient” — maybe it wants the exact value.\\n\\nBut let’s look back: we have $ d = 1 $, $ P(d)/P(-d) = P(1)/P(-1) = -4020024/4020026 $\\n\\nBut simplify:\\n\\n$$\\n-\\\\frac{4020024}{4020026} = -\\\\frac{2010012}{2010013}\\n$$\\n\\nBut perhaps leave as is.\\n\\nWait — perhaps I made a mistake in the beginning.\\n\\nWait: the original problem was: find smallest $ n > 1 $ such that RMS of first $ n $ positive integers is integer.\\n\\nRMS = $ \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{1^2 + 2^2 + \\\\cdots + n^2}{n} } $\\n\\nSum of squares: $ \\\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} $\\n\\nSo RMS = $ \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} } $\\n\\nSet this equal to integer $ k $:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} = k^2\\n\\\\Rightarrow (n+1)(2n+1) = 6k^2\\n$$\\n\\nWe want smallest $ n > 1 $ such that this is 6 times a square.\\n\\nBut the problem says: “Instead of determining... simply find $ d = a - 14 $, where $ a $ is the smallest positive integer >1 such that there exists integer $ b $ with $ 4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1 $”\\n\\nSo they are telling us to skip the RMS part and go directly to solving $ 4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1 $\\n\\nWe did: $ a = 15 $, $ d = 1 $\\n\\nThen use that in the polynomial quotient.\\n\\nBut perhaps the polynomial part is independent.\\n\\nBut our calculation gives a messy answer.\\n\\nWait — perhaps the polynomial $ P $ is not the one we constructed.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps $ P $ is such that $ P(z^2) = 0 $ whenever $ z^5 + 2004z = 1 $, but $ P $ could be the product over roots, but we did that.\\n\\nOr perhaps $ P $ is the minimal polynomial of $ z^2 $ over $ \\\\mathbb{Q} $, but for a generic $ z $, it might have lower degree, but the problem says “a polynomial $ P $ of degree 5 with the property that if $ z^5 + 2004z = 1 $, then $ P(z^2) = 0 $” — so it doesn't have to be minimal, just annihilate all $ z^2 $ for such $ z $. Our $ P(x) = x(x^2 + 2004)^2 - 1 $ works, and is degree 5.\\n\\nBut is there a different polynomial?\\n\\nSuppose we consider that the values $ z_j^2 $ are roots of $ P $, so $ P(x) = \\\\prod (x - z_j^2) $\\n\\nThen $ P(1) = \\\\prod (1 - z_j^2) $, $ P(-1) = \\\\prod (-1 - z_j^2) = (-1)^5 \\\\prod (1 + z_j^2) = - \\\\prod (1 + z_j^2) $\\n\\nSo ratio is $ - \\\\prod \\\\frac{1 - z_j^2}{1 + z_j^2} $\\n\\nNow, $ \\\\frac{1 - z_j^2}{1 + z_j^2} = \\\\frac{(1 - z_j)(1 + z_j)}{1 + z_j^2} $\\n\\nNot helpful.\\n\\nFrom the equation $ z_j^5 + 2004 z_j = 1 $, and we have expression in terms of $ z_j $, but hard to sum over roots.\\n\\nPerhaps the intended insight is that $ P(x) $ is an odd function plus constant?\\n\\nLook at our $ P(x) = x^5 + 4008x^3 + 2004^2 x - 1 $\\n\\nThe first three terms are odd function, last is constant.\\n\\nSo $ P(-x) = -x^5 - 4008x^3 - 2004^2 x - 1 = - (x^5 + 4008x^3 + 2004^2 x) - 1 $\\n\\nWhile $ -P(x) = -x^5 - 4008x^3 - 2004^2 x + 1 $\\n\\nSo not odd or even.\\n\\nBut notice that $ P(x) + P(-x) = [x^5 + ... -1] + [-x^5 - ... -1] = -2 $\\n\\nAnd $ P(x) - P(-x) = 2(x^5 + 4008x^3 + 2004^2 x) $\\n\\nBut not immediately helpful.\\n\\nWith $ d = 1 $, we have to live with the calculation.\\n\\nBut let's accept that:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \\\\frac{4020024}{-4020026} = -\\\\frac{2010012}{2010013}\\n$$\\n\\nBut perhaps the problem expects a numerical value, or maybe I miscalculated $ a $.\\n\\nLet me double-check the Diophantine equation.\\n\\n$ 4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1 $\\n\\nThis is a Pell-like equation.\\n\\nLet me write as:\\n\\n$ (2b)^2 - 3a^2 = 1 $\\n\\nLet $ u = 2b $, then:\\n\\n$ u^2 - 3a^2 = 1 $\\n\\nThis is the Pell equation $ u^2 - 3a^2 = 1 $\\n\\nFundamental solution: smallest solution with $ a > 0 $\\n\\nTry $ a = 1 $: $ u^2 = 1 + 3 = 4 $, $ u = 2 $, so $ b = 1 $\\n\\nSo $ a = 1 $, $ b = 1 $: $ 4(1) - 3(1) = 1 $, yes.\\n\\nBut the problem asks for $ a > 1 $, so next solution.\\n\\nPell equation $ u^2 - 3a^2 = 1 $, fundamental solution is $ (u,a) = (2,1) $, then solutions are given by:\\n\\n$ u_k + a_k \\\\sqrt{3} = (2 + \\\\sqrt{3})^k $\\n\\nNext solution: $ k=2 $: $ (2+\\\\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 + 4\\\\sqrt{3} + 3 = 7 + 4\\\\sqrt{3} $\\n\\nSo $ u = 7 $, $ a = 4 $\\n\\nCheck: $ 7^2 - 3*4^2 = 49 - 48 = 1 $, yes.\\n\\nSo $ a = 4 $, $ b = u/2 = 7/2 = 3.5 $, not integer!\\n\\nOh! $ b $ must be integer, so $ u = 2b $ must be even.\\n\\nHere $ u = 7 $, odd, so $ b $ not integer.\\n\\nNext solution: $ k=3 $: $ (2+\\\\sqrt{3})^3 = (2+\\\\sqrt{3})(7+4\\\\sqrt{3}) = 14 + 8\\\\sqrt{3} + 7\\\\sqrt{3} + 12 = 26 + 15\\\\sqrt{3} $\\n\\nSo $ u = 26 $, $ a = 15 $\\n\\n$ u = 26 $ even, so $ b = 13 $\\n\\nCheck: $ 4*(13)^2 - 3*(15)^2 = 4*169 = 676, 3*225=675, 676-675=1 $, yes.\\n\\nAnd $ a = 15 > 1 $\\n\\nPrevious solution with integer $ b $: $ a=1 $, $ b=1 $, but $ a=1 $ not greater than 1 in the context? Wait, the problem says \"greater than one\", so $ a>1 $, so $ a=15 $ is the smallest such.\\n\\nBut is there a solution between? $ k=1 $: $ a=1 $, $ k=2 $: $ a=4 $, $ b=3.5 $ invalid, $ k=3 $: $ a=15 $, valid.\\n\\nSo yes, $ a=15 $, $ d=1 $\\n\\nSo that part is correct.\\n\\nBack to the polynomial.\\n\\nPerhaps the polynomial $ P $ is meant to be even or have symmetry.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps for each root $ z $, $ P(z^2) = 0 $, but $ P $ could be in terms of elementary symmetric functions.\\n\\nBut our construction seems solid.\\n\\nPerhaps the quotient is -1, and the difference is due to approximation, but no, it's off by 2 in denominator.\\n\\nWait — in $ P(-1) $, we have:\\n\\n$ P(-1) = (-1)^5 + 4008*(-1)^3 + 2004^2*(-1) - 1 = -1 + (-4008) + (-4,016,016) - 1 = - (1 + 4008 + 4,016,016 + 1) = -4,020,026 $\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nBut perhaps the constant term is +1? No, we have -1.\\n\\nUnless the polynomial is defined differently.\\n\\nLet me re-expand $ x(x^2 + 2004)^2 - 1 $\\n\\n$ (x^2 + 2004)^2 = x^4 + 2*2004 x^2 + 2004^2 = x^4 + 4008x^2 + 2004^2 $\\n\\nThen multiply by x: $ x^5 + 4008x^3 + 2004^2 x $\\n\\nThen minus 1: $ x^5 + 4008x^3 + 2004^2 x - 1 $\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo I think the answer is indeed $ -\\\\frac{4020024}{4020026} $, but simplified.\\n\\nAs a reduced fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 2:\\n\\n$ -\\\\frac{2010012}{2010013} $\\n\\nAnd since 2010012 and 2010013 are consecutive integers almost, gcd is 1.\\n\\nSo the quotient is $ -\\\\frac{2010012}{2010013} $\\n\\nBut perhaps the problem expects a numerical evaluation, or maybe I need to box it.\\n\\nBut let's see the instruction: \"Calculate the quotient P(d) / P(-d)\"\\n\\nSo it's a rational number.\\n\\nMaybe write it as a decimal, but no, exact value.\\n\\nPerhaps there's a typo, and the polynomial is different.\\n\\nAnother thought: the equation is $ z^5 + 2004 z = 1 $, but perhaps it's $ z^5 + 2004 = z $, but no.\\n\\nOr perhaps the polynomial P is such that it's the minimal polynomial, but for a specific z, but the problem says \"if z is a complex number such that z^5 + 2004z = 1, then P(z^2)=0\", so for all such z, so P must vanish at all z^2 for z solving the equation.\\n\\nSo our P is correct.\\n\\nPerhaps the degree 5 is a hint that it's exactly this polynomial.\\n\\nSo I think we have to go with it.\\n\\nSo final answer is $ -\\\\frac{2010012}{2010013} $\\n\\nBut let's write it nicely.\\n\\nSince d=1, P(1)/P(-1) = [1 + 4008 + 2004^2 - 1] / [ -1 -4008 -2004^2 -1 ] = (4008 + 2004^2) / (-4010 - 2004^2) \\n\\n= - (2004^2 + 4008) / (2004^2 + 4010)\\n\\nNote that 4008 = 2*2004, 4010 = 2*2004 + 2\\n\\nBut not obvious.\\n\\nSo I think the answer is -2010012/2010013\\n\\nBut let's box it as instructed.\\n\\nHowever, upon second thought, perhaps the polynomial is defined up to scalar multiple, but the quotient P(d)/P(-d) would be the same regardless of scalar, since it cancels.\\n\\nSo our calculation is invariant under scaling.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is -2010012/2010013\\n\\nBut let's confirm the arithmetic once more:\\n\\n2004^2 = 2004 * 2004\\n\\n2000^2 = 4,000,000\\n4^2 = 16\\n2*2000*4 = 16,000\\nSo 4,000,000 + 16,000 + 16 = 4,016,016 ✓\\n\\nP(1) = 1^5 =1\\n4008*1^3=4008\\n2004^2*1=4,016,016\\n-1\\nSum: 1 + 4008 = 4009; 4009 + 4,016,016 = 4,020,025; 4,020,025 - 1 = 4,020,024 ✓\\n\\nEarlier I said 1 and -1 cancel, but it's +1 from x^5 and -1 from constant, so they do cancel, leaving 4008 + 4,016,016 = 4,020,024 ✓\\n\\nP(-1) = (-1)^5 = -1\\n4008*(-1)^3 = 4008*(-1) = -4008\\n2004^2 * (-1) = -4,016,016\\n-1\\nSum: -1 -4008 = -4009; -4009 -4,016,016 = -4,020,025; -4,020,025 -1 = -4,020,026 ✓\\n\\nSo P(1)/P(-1) = 4,020,024 / (-4,020,026) = -4020024/4020026\\n\\nReduce by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: -2010012/2010013\\n\\nAnd 2010012 and 2010013 are consecutive integers? 2010013 - 2010012 = 1, so they are consecutive, hence coprime.\\n\\nSo the fraction is in lowest terms.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is -2010012/2010013\",\n    \"answer\": \"-2010012/2010013\"\n}",
