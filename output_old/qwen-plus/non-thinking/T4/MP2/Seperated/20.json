What is the maximum number of uncovered squares Alice can ensure, regardless of Bob's play?\\n\\nEach tile covers 2 squares. Total squares: 2022 (even).\\nMaximum number of tiles: 1011, covering all → 0 uncovered.\\nBut depending on play, some may be left.\\n\\nUncovered squares occur when isolated single squares remain, or odd-length blocks.\\n\\nThis is a classic combinatorial game.\\n\\nNote: once a tile is placed, it splits the board into independent segments.\\n\\nAlice wants to leave as many uncovered as possible; Bob wants to cover as much as possible.\\n\\nSince each tile covers 2 squares, the number of uncovered squares is even? No: total squares even, each tile removes 2, so parity preserved → uncovered squares even.\\n2022 even, each move reduces uncovered by 2, so always even number uncovered. So answer will be even.\\n\\nAlice moves first.\\n\\nI recall that in such tiling games on a line, the outcome depends on controlling the parity and creating isolated cells.\\n\\nA key idea: if a player creates an isolated square (surrounded by covered tiles), then that square can never be covered, so it remains uncovered.\\n\\nSo players may try to create or prevent isolated singles.\\n\\nBut placing a tile in the middle of a segment splits it into two independent games.\\n\\nStandard approach: use symmetry or pairing strategy.\\n\\nBob might use a pairing strategy to limit damage.\\n\\nBut Alice goes first.\\n\\nSuppose the board has length $ n = 2022 $.\\n\\nKnown result: in a 1×n board, two players alternately place dominoes (2×1), Alice wants to maximize uncovered, Bob minimize.\\n\\nWhat is the value?\\n\\nI recall that Alice can force at least 2 uncovered squares.\\n\\nBut can she force more?\\n\\nConsider small cases.\\n\\nLet $ f(n) $ be the number of uncovered squares when both play optimally, Alice maximizing, Bob minimizing.\\n\\nBase cases:\\n\\n- $ n=0 $: 0 uncovered\\n- $ n=1 $: no move possible, 1 uncovered. But Alice doesn't move, so game over immediately → 1 uncovered. But in our case, Alice moves first, but if no move, she can't move.\\nBut for $ n=1 $, no move possible, so 1 uncovered.\\nBut in our game, $ n=2022 \\\\geq 2 $, so moves exist initially.\\n\\nBut during game, segments of length 1 may appear.\\n\\nDefine $ g(n) $: the number of uncovered squares at end when starting from a segment of length $ n $, with current player to move, and both play optimally, but now we need to define whose turn and objectives.\\n\\nBut here, Alice and Bob alternate, Alice starts, and Alice wants to maximize uncovered, Bob to minimize.\\n\\nSo it's a two-player game with opposite goals.\\n\\nLet $ v(n) $ be the number of uncovered squares at the end when playing on a path of $ n $ cells, with Alice to move, and both play optimally toward their goals.\\n\\nSimilarly, let $ w(n) $ be the value when Bob is to move.\\n\\nBut since players alternate, and Alice starts, we want $ v(2022) $.\\n\\nNow, recurrence:\\n\\nIf $ n < 2 $, no move possible:\\n- If $ n=0 $: uncovered = 0\\n- If $ n=1 $: uncovered = 1\\n\\nFor $ n \\\\geq 2 $:\\n\\nWhen a player places a domino, they choose a position $ i $ from 1 to $ n-1 $, covering cells $ i $ and $ i+1 $.\\nThis splits the board into left segment of length $ i-1 $ and right segment of length $ n-i-1 $.\\nThen the next player plays on the remaining board, which is disconnected, so the game continues independently on each component.\\n\\nAfter a move, the turn passes to the other player, who then chooses which component to play in (if any moves possible).\\n\\nIn such games, when multiple components, the next player chooses one component to play in.\\n\\nSo the game becomes a sum of games.\\n\\nThe total uncovered squares will be the sum of uncovered squares from each component.\\n\\nSince the objectives are additive, we can analyze each segment separately.\\n\\nNow, for a single segment of size $ n $, with a player to move.\\n\\nLet $ A(n) $: max min uncovered when Alice is to move on a segment of size $ n $\\nLet $ B(n) $: min max uncovered when Bob is to move on a segment of size $ n $\\n\\nMore precisely:\\n- $ A(n) $: assuming optimal play, the number of uncovered squares when Alice moves first on a segment of size $ n $\\n- $ B(n) $: same when Bob moves first\\n\\nThen:\\n\\nFor $ n = 0 $: $ A(0) = 0 $, $ B(0) = 0 $\\nFor $ n = 1 $: no move, so $ A(1) = 1 $, $ B(1) = 1 $\\n\\nFor $ n \\\\geq 2 $:\\n\\nWhen Alice moves on size $ n $, she chooses a move: place domino at position $ i $ (covering $ i,i+1 $), splitting into left of size $ i-1 $, right of size $ n-i-1 $\\nThen Bob moves next, and he will play optimally to minimize the total uncovered.\\nAfter the split, the game consists of two independent subgames, and Bob, moving next, will choose which subgame to play in (if any move possible in either).\\n\\nThe total uncovered will be the sum of uncovered from left and right subgames.\\n\\nSince Bob moves next, and he chooses where to play, he will choose the subgame where his move leads to minimal increase in uncovered, but actually, he wants to minimize the total, so he will play in a component that allows him to reduce the uncovered count most, but it's a bit tricky.\\n\\nActually, after the split, the two subgames are independent, and the next player (Bob) chooses one to play in. The game proceeds with players alternating globally.\\n\\nThe total uncovered is the sum over all components at the end.\\n\\nFor such impartial games with additive scoring, the value of a sum is the sum of values only if the game is non-interacting, but here the turn order matters.\\n\\nHowever, since the players alternate globally, and choose which component to move in, this is like the disjunctive sum.\\n\\nBut in this case, because the scoring is additive and the game ends when no moves are possible, and players want to control the total uncovered, we can define the value recursively.\\n\\nSpecifically, when a player makes a move that splits into components of sizes $ a $ and $ b $, then the resulting game has two components, and the opponent moves next.\\n\\nLet $ V(a,b) $ be the total uncovered squares when there are two independent segments of size $ a $ and $ b $, and it is Bob's turn to move (in this case, after Alice moved).\\n\\nThen Bob will choose to move in one of the components, say he chooses a component where a move is possible, and plays optimally in it.\\n\\nThe total uncovered will be the sum of the uncovered from both components, but since they are independent, and play continues, the total is $ U_{\\\\text{left}} + U_{\\\\text{right}} $, where $ U_{\\\\text{left}} $ depends on the subgame on left, etc.\\n\\nMoreover, since the subgames are independent, the total uncovered is indeed the sum of the uncovered from each connected component at the end.\\n\\nAnd the order of play: the next player chooses which component to play in.\\n\\nThis is standard in combinatorial game theory.\\n\\nFor a collection of games, the next player chooses one game to make a move in.\\n\\nThe total score (uncovered squares) is the sum of scores from each component.\\n\\nPlayers have global objectives.\\n\\nTo compute $ A(n) $ for $ n \\\\geq 2 $:\\n\\nAlice chooses a move: place domino at position $ i $, $ 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n-1 $, covering cells $ i,i+1 $\\nThis leaves two segments: left of size $ L = i-1 $, right of size $ R = n-i-1 $\\nNote: if $ i=1 $, left size 0; if $ i=n-1 $, right size 0\\n\\nAfter this, Bob is to move on the combined system of these two segments.\\n\\nLet $ T(L,R) $ be the total uncovered squares when there are segments of size $ L $ and $ R $, and Bob is to move.\\n\\nThen $ T(L,R) = \\\\min $ over Bob's choices of what he can achieve.\\n\\nBob can choose to move in the left segment (if $ L \\\\geq 2 $), or in the right (if $ R \\\\geq 2 $), or if both, he chooses the one that minimizes the final uncovered.\\n\\nIf he moves in left, he makes a move that splits left into smaller parts, and then Alice moves next on the new configuration.\\n\\nSpecifically, if Bob moves in a segment of size $ s \\\\geq 2 $, he chooses a split, resulting in two sub-segments, say of sizes $ a,b $, then the new set of components is the other original components plus these two new ones, and now Alice moves next.\\n\\nThis gets complicated.\\n\\nNote that $ T(L,R) $, with Bob to move, is equal to the value of the disjunctive sum.\\n\\nBut perhaps we can compute $ A(n) $ and $ B(n) $ recursively.\\n\\nDefine:\\n- $ A(n) $: uncovered squares when segment of size $ n $, Alice to move, both optimal\\n- $ B(n) $: same, Bob to move\\n\\nThen:\\n\\nFor $ n < 2 $:\\n- $ A(0) = 0 $, $ A(1) = 1 $\\n- $ B(0) = 0 $, $ B(1) = 1 $\\n\\nFor $ n \\\\geq 2 $:\\n\\n$ A(n) = \\\\max $ over all possible moves (i.e., positions to place domino) of the resulting $ T $, but after Alice moves, Bob is to move on the new components.\\n\\nWhen Alice places a domino at position $ i $, it splits into left size $ L = i-1 $, right size $ R = n-i-1 $\\nThen the game has components of size $ L $ and $ R $, and Bob to move.\\n\\nThe total uncovered from this point is $ B(L,R) $, the value when Bob moves first on the sum of two games of sizes $ L $ and $ R $.\\n\\nBut $ B(L,R) $ is not simply related to $ B(L) $ and $ B(R) $, because Bob chooses where to play.\\n\\nIn fact, for a sum of games, with a player to move, they choose one component to move in.\\n\\nSo for two components of sizes $ L $ and $ R $, with Bob to move:\\n\\n- If $ L < 2 $ and $ R < 2 $, no move possible, so uncovered = uncovered from left + uncovered from right = $ u(L) + u(R) $, where $ u(0)=0, u(1)=1 $\\n- Else, Bob can choose to move in a component where a move is possible.\\n  - He can move in left if $ L \\\\geq 2 $, resulting in splitting left into two parts, say after his move, left is replaced by two segments of sizes $ a,b $ with $ a+b = L-2 $, and then Alice moves next on the new set: sizes $ a,b,R $\\n  - Similarly for right.\\n\\nBut this is very complex.\\n\\nThere is a known result for this game.\\n\\nI recall that in such a game, the second player can often force a pairing.\\n\\nBut Alice is first and wants to maximize uncovered.\\n\\nAnother thought: the minimal number of uncovered squares is 0 if n even and players cooperate, but here Bob wants to minimize, Alice might obstruct.\\n\\nBut Alice wants to maximize, so she might play in a way to create isolated cells.\\n\\nFor example, if Alice places a domino in the center, but that might help coverage.\\n\\nSuppose Alice wants to create a single uncovered cell.\\n\\nFor instance, if she could isolate a single cell, it stays uncovered.\\n\\nBut to isolate a cell, she needs to have tiles on both sides, but she can't do that directly.\\n\\nA standard strategy for Alice is to play in the center or in a way to create symmetry.\\n\\nI found online or recall that in a 1xn board, with Alice wanting to maximize uncovered, Bob minimize, the number is 2 if n even, greater than 2?\\n\\nTry small n.\\n\\nLet me compute for small n.\\n\\nLet $ v(n) $ be the number of uncovered squares when both play optimally, Alice first.\\n\\nn=0: 0\\nn=1: no move, 1 uncovered. But Alice doesn't move, so v(1)=1\\nn=2: Alice must place a tile covering both squares. Then done. Uncovered = 0. So v(2)=0\\nn=3: Alice can place a tile on left two: covers 1,2, leaves cell 3 uncovered. Then no move possible. Uncovered =1.\\nOr place on right two: covers 2,3, leaves cell 1 uncovered. Same.\\nBob has no move after, so uncovered=1.\\nCan Alice do better? Only two choices, both lead to 1 uncovered.\\nSo v(3)=1\\nn=4: Alice moves first.\\nOptions:\\n- Place in middle: say cover 2,3. Then left: cell 1, right: cell 4. Two isolated cells. Bob cannot move. Game over. Uncovered =2.\\n- Place on left: cover 1,2. Then cells 3,4 uncovered, adjacent. Bob can cover them. Then no uncovered. So uncovered=0.\\n- Similarly, place on right: cover 3,4, then Bob covers 1,2, uncovered=0.\\nSo Alice, wanting to maximize, will choose to place in middle, getting 2 uncovered.\\nSo v(4)=2\\nn=5: Alice moves.\\nOptions:\\n- Cover 1,2: leaves 3,4,5. Bob moves on this segment of 3. From earlier, on size 3, the player to move (Bob) can force? On size 3, first player (Bob) can cover two, leave one uncovered. So uncovered from right:1. Left part: none. Total uncovered=1.\\n- Cover 2,3: then left: cell 1, right: cells 4,5. Bob can cover 4,5, leaving cell 1 uncovered. Total uncovered=1.\\n- Cover 3,4: similar, by symmetry, uncovered=1 (cell 5 or 1)\\n- Cover 4,5: similar to cover 1,2, uncovered=1\\nSo all moves lead to 1 uncovered. So v(5)=1\\nn=6: Alice moves.\\nOptions:\\n- Cover 1,2: leaves 3,4,5,6. Bob plays on size 4. From earlier, v(4)=2, but that's when Alice moves first. Now Bob is moving first on size 4.\\nDefine B(n): when Bob moves first on size n.\\nFrom n=4: if Bob moves first, what happens?\\nBob wants to minimize uncovered.\\nOn size 4, Bob can:\\n- Cover in middle: 2,3, then leaves cell 1 and 4 uncovered. Uncovered=2\\n- Cover on end: say 1,2, then leaves 3,4, Alice can cover them, uncovered=0\\nSo Bob, wanting to minimize, will choose to cover on end, leading to uncovered=0.\\nSo B(4)=0\\nBack to n=6, Alice covers 1,2, leaves size 4, Bob to move, so uncovered = B(4) = 0\\nSimilarly if Alice covers 5,6, same thing, uncovered=0\\n- Alice covers 2,3: then left: cell 1, right: cells 4,5,6\\nBob can choose to play in right (size 3) or in left, but left size 1, no move.\\nSo Bob plays on right size 3.\\nOn size 3, Bob to move: he can cover two, leave one uncovered. So uncovered from right:1, plus cell 1 uncovered, total uncovered=2\\n- Alice covers 3,4: then left: cells 1,2, right: cells 5,6\\nBob can cover 1,2 and then cover 5,6? No, he makes one move.\\nHe can choose to cover 1,2, then leaves 5,6, Alice can cover them, uncovered=0\\nOr cover 5,6, then Alice covers 1,2, uncovered=0\\nSo whichever he does, uncovered=0\\n- Alice covers 4,5: similar to cover 2,3, by symmetry, uncovered=2\\nSummary:\\n- Cover end (1,2) or (5,6): uncovered = 0\\n- Cover near end (2,3) or (4,5): uncovered = 2\\n- Cover center (3,4): uncovered = 0\\nAlice wants to maximize, so she will choose to cover (2,3) or (4,5), getting uncovered=2\\nSo v(6)=2\\nn=7: Alice moves.\\nPossible moves:\\n- Cover 1,2: leaves size 5, Bob to move.\\nWhat is B(5)? Bob first on size 5.\\nBob wants to minimize uncovered.\\nOn size 5, Bob can:\\n  - Cover end: 1,2, leaves size 3. Then Alice on size 3, v(3)=1, so uncovered=1\\n  - Cover 2,3: leaves cell 1 and size 4 (cells 4,5). Bob covered 2,3, so cells:1, and 4,5. Alice can cover 4,5, leaving cell 1, uncovered=1\\n  - Cover 3,4: leaves cells 1,2 and cell 5. Alice can cover 1,2, leaving cell 5, uncovered=1\\n  - Similarly for other symmetric moves.\\n  Can Bob get 0? Seems not, all give at least 1.\\n  Is there a move that gives 0? Probably not, since 5 odd, at least one uncovered.\\n  But can he force 1? Yes, as above.\\n  So B(5)=1\\nBack: if Alice covers 1,2, uncovered = B(5)=1\\nSimilarly for covering 6,7: same, uncovered=1\\n- Cover 2,3: then left: cell 1, right: cells 4,5,6,7 (size 4)\\nBob to move. He can play in right size 4.\\nB(4)=0, as before, so he can make uncovered from right be 0, and cell 1 uncovered, so total uncovered=1\\n- Cover 3,4: then left: cells 1,2, right: cells 5,6,7 (size 3)\\nBob can play in left or right.\\nIf he plays in left (size 2), covers 1,2, then right size 3, Alice to move, v(3)=1, so uncovered=1\\nIf he plays in right, covers say 5,6, leaves cell 7, then left size 2, Alice covers 1,2, uncovered=1\\nSame.\\n- Cover 4,5: then left: cells 1,2,3 (size 3), right: cells 6,7 (size 2)\\nBob can cover 6,7, then left size 3, Alice to move, v(3)=1, uncovered=1\\nOr cover in left, say cover 1,2, then leaves cell 3 and 6,7, Alice covers 6,7, uncovered=1\\nSo all moves lead to uncovered=1\\nThus v(7)=1\\nn=8: Alice moves.\\nOptions:\\n- Cover end: 1,2, leaves size 6, Bob to move.\\nWhat is B(6)? Bob first on size 6.\\nBob wants to minimize uncovered.\\nOn size 6, Bob can:\\n  - Cover end: 1,2, leaves size 4, Alice to move, v(4)=2, so uncovered=2\\n  - Cover near end: 2,3, leaves cell 1 and size 4 (4,5,6,7,8? wait size 6: cells 1 to 6.\\nCover 2,3: left cell 1, right cells 4,5,6 (size 3)\\nThen Alice to move. She can play in right, cover 4,5, leave cell 6, then uncovered: cell 1 and cell 6, total 2\\nOr cover 5,6, leave cell 4, same.\\nCan she get more? Max she can get is 2 in this case.\\nIf Bob covers center: 3,4, then left:1,2, right:5,6\\nAlice can cover 1,2 and 5,6? She makes one move.\\nShe can cover 1,2, then Bob covers 5,6, uncovered=0\\nOr cover 5,6, Bob covers 1,2, uncovered=0\\nSo if Bob covers 3,4, then Alice is forced to allow Bob to cover the rest, uncovered=0\\nSimilarly, if Bob covers 4,5, same by symmetry.\\nSo Bob can choose to cover 3,4 or 4,5, leading to uncovered=0\\nThus B(6)=0\\nBack to Alice on n=8: if she covers end (1,2), then uncovered = B(6)=0\\nSimilarly for covering 7,8: uncovered=0\\n- Cover near end: say 2,3: then left: cell 1, right: cells 4,5,6,7,8 (size 5)\\nBob to move on this.\\nB(5)=1, as before, so uncovered from right is 1, plus cell 1, total uncovered=2\\n- Cover 3,4: then left: cells 1,2, right: cells 5,6,7,8 (size 4)\\nBob can play in right size 4.\\nB(4)=0, so he can make right have 0 uncovered, and left size 2, but after his move, Alice moves.\\nBob moves in right: he can, as before, cover an end, say 5,6, then leaves 7,8, Alice can cover them, so right covered completely.\\nThen left cells 1,2, Alice can cover them? After Bob moves, it's Alice's turn, and only left segment size 2, she can cover it.\\nSo uncovered=0\\nIf Bob tries other moves, but he can achieve 0.\\nSo uncovered=0\\n- Cover 4,5: then left: cells 1,2,3,4? Cover 4,5, so cells 1,2,3 and 6,7,8\\nLeft size 3, right size 3\\nBob to move. He can play in left or right.\\nSay he plays in left size 3: he covers two, leaves one uncovered, say cell 1 or 3.\\nThen Alice plays in right size 3, she can leave one uncovered.\\nSo total uncovered=2\\nSimilarly if he plays in right.\\nCan Bob do better? If he could cover in a way to connect, but no, segments are separate.\\nSo whatever he does, after his move, one segment has one uncovered, the other full size 3 with Alice to move, she will leave one uncovered, so total 2 uncovered.\\nSo in this case, uncovered=2\\nSummary for Alice on n=8:\\n- Cover end: uncovered=0\\n- Cover 2,3 or 7,6: uncovered=2\\n- Cover 3,4 or 6,5: uncovered=0\\n- Cover 4,5: uncovered=2\\nSo Alice can choose to cover 2,3, or 4,5, or 6,7, to get uncovered=2\\nSo v(8)=2\\nPattern emerging:\\nn | v(n)\\n0 | 0\\n1 | 1\\n2 | 0\\n3 | 1\\n4 | 2\\n5 | 1\\n6 | 2\\n7 | 1\\n8 | 2\\n\\nFor n>=2, when n even, v(n)=2 if n divisible by 4? n=4:2, n=6:2, n=8:2\\nn=2:0, exception\\nn=2 is 0\\nn=4,6,8:2\\nn=1,3,5,7:1\\nSo for n>=4 even, v(n)=2?\\nBut n=2 is 0\\nCheck n=9\\nn=9: Alice moves.\\nSuppose she covers 1,2: leaves size 7, Bob to move.\\nB(7): Bob first on size 7.\\nSimilar to before, likely B(7)=1, since odd, at least 1, and probably can force 1.\\nThen uncovered=1\\nOther moves may give more, but Alice wants to maximize.\\nSuppose she covers 4,5: then left size 3, right size 4 (cells 6,7,8,9)\\nBob to move.\\nHe can play in left or right.\\nIf he plays in left size 3, he can make it have 1 uncovered (as B(3)=1? On size 3, Bob first: he covers two, leaves one, uncovered=1, then right size 4, Alice to move, v(4)=2, so total uncovered=1+2=3\\nIf he plays in right size 4, B(4)=0, so he can make right have 0 uncovered, then left size 3, Alice to move, v(3)=1, so uncovered=1\\nSo Bob, wanting to minimize, will choose to play in the right, achieving uncovered=1\\nSo if Alice covers 4,5, uncovered=1\\nSimilarly, other moves.\\nCan she get more than 1?\\nSuppose she covers 3,4: then left: cells 1,2, right: cells 5,6,7,8,9 (size 5)\\nBob to move.\\nHe can play in right, B(5)=1, so uncovered from right=1, and left size 2, but after his move, Alice moves.\\nBob moves in right: he can, as before, make uncovered from right be 1, and then left size 2, Alice can cover it, so total uncovered=1\\nIf he plays in left, covers 1,2, then right size 5, Alice to move, v(5)=1, uncovered=1\\nSo again 1\\nSimilarly for other moves.\\nSo v(9)=1\\nn=10: similarly, likely v(10)=2\\nIn general, it seems that for n >= 4, if n even, v(n)=2, if n odd, v(n)=1, except n=2:0\\nBut n=2 is small.\\nFor n=2022, which is even, greater than 2, so v(n)=2?\\nBut is this true?\\nFrom n=4,6,8: all give 2\\nBut can Alice always force 2 uncovered squares?\\nYes, by a strategy: for example, on even n>=4, she can place a domino in the center or in a way to create two odd-sized segments, but in the examples, when she places appropriately, she can force 2.\\nIn particular, for n even, n>=4, Alice can place a domino covering positions k and k+1 for some k not at end, such that it leaves segments that allow her to force 2.\\nBut in the calculation, she can achieve 2.\\nMoreover, Bob cannot force less than 2? In the cases, when she plays well, she gets 2, and if she plays poorly, she might get 0, but she won't.\\nBut can Bob force fewer than 2?\\nSuppose for n=4, if Alice plays badly, uncovered=0, but she won't, she can force 2.\\nSimilarly for larger n.\\nBut is it possible that for larger n, Bob can force 0?\\nFor example, n=6: if Alice covers end, Bob can make uncovered=0, but Alice won't do that; she covers 2,3, forcing uncovered=2.\\nSimilarly for n=8.\\nNow for n=2022, even, large.\\nAlice can use a strategy to ensure at least 2 uncovered.\\nBut can she ensure more than 2?\\nFrom the pattern, no, because in all cases above, the maximum she can force is 2 for even n>2.\\nFor example, in n=4, max is 2.\\nn=6, max is 2.\\nIs there a way for Alice to force 4 uncovered?\\nProbably not, because Bob can always work to cover.\\nIn fact, Bob can use a pairing strategy.\\nFor example, Bob can imagine pairing the squares: (1,2),(3,4),...,(2021,2022)\\nThen whenever Alice places a tile, if it covers a whole pair, fine, but if it straddles pairs, it might mess up.\\nBut Alice can place a tile that covers, say, 2 and 3, which are in different pairs.\\nThen Bob can respond.\\nBut in any case, from the recursive pattern, it seems that v(n) = 2 for even n >=4, v(n)=1 for odd n, v(2)=0.\\nBut v(2)=0, v(4)=2, etc.\\nNow n=2022 is even, greater than 2, so v(2022)=2?\\nBut let's confirm with n=10.\\nSuppose n=10.\\nAlice wants to maximize.\\nSuppose she places a tile at position 2,3: covering cells 2,3.\\nThen left: cell 1, right: cells 4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (size 7)\\nBob to move.\\nB(7): as before, likely 1, so uncovered from right is 1, plus cell 1, total 2.\\nCan she get more?\\nSuppose she places at 5,6: center.\\nThen left: cells 1,2,3,4 (size 4), right: cells 7,8,9,10 (size 4)\\nBob to move.\\nHe can play in left or right.\\nSay he plays in left size 4.\\nAs B(4)=0, he can make left have 0 uncovered (by covering an end, then Alice is forced to allow him to cover the rest).\\nSimilarly for right.\\nBut after he moves in left, say he covers 1,2, then leaves 3,4, Alice can cover them? After Bob covers 1,2, it's Alice's turn, she can cover 3,4, so left covered.\\nThen right size 4, Bob's turn, he can cover it completely as B(4)=0? On size 4, Bob to move: he can cover 7,8, then Alice covers 9,10, or he covers 8,9, then leaves 7 and 10, uncovered=2, but he doesn't want that.\\nOn size 4, Bob to move: if he covers an end, say 7,8, then leaves 9,10, Alice covers them, uncovered=0.\\nSimilarly, if he covers 9,10, Alice covers 7,8.\\nIf he covers 8,9, then leaves 7 and 10, uncovered=2, which is worse.\\nSo he will cover an end, achieving uncovered=0 for that component.\\nSo if Bob plays in left, he can make left uncovered=0, then right size 4, Alice to move, v(4)=2, so uncovered from right=2, total uncovered=2.\\nSimilarly if he plays in right first, same thing, uncovered=2.\\nSo total uncovered=2.\\nCan Alice do better? Suppose she places at 1,2: then leaves size 8, Bob to move, B(8): what is it?\\nSimilarly, Bob can probably make it 0 or 2, but likely he can make uncovered small.\\nSuppose B(8)=0, then uncovered=0, worse for Alice.\\nSo she won't do that.\\nOther moves seem to give at most 2.\\nSo v(10)=2.\\nThus for even n>=4, v(n)=2.\\nNow n=2022 is even, greater than 4, so v(2022)=2.\\nBut is there a way for Alice to force more?\\nSuppose she tries to create multiple isolated cells.\\nBut Bob will try to prevent.\\nFrom the pattern, it seems capped at 2.\\nMoreover, since the total number is even, and at least 0, but she can force 2, and cannot force more, so 2 is the answer.\\nBut in n=4, she forces 2, which is half, but for larger n, 2 is small.\\nBut according to the game, yes.\\nAnother way: the only way to have uncovered squares is to have isolated cells, and each isolated cell contributes 1.\\nTo isolate a cell, it must be surrounded by covered tiles or ends.\\nBut since the board is linear, cells at end can be isolated if the adjacent is covered but not them.\\nBut in optimal play, Bob will try to cover everything.\\nAlice can force exactly two uncovered squares by, for example, placing her first tile in the second and third positions, covering cells 2 and 3.\\nThen cell 1 is isolated (since 2 is covered), and the rest is a segment from 4 to 2022, size 2019.\\nSize 2019 is odd, so at least one uncovered in that segment.\\nBut Bob moves next on the large segment.\\nSince size 2019 is odd, no matter how they play, at least one uncovered in that component.\\nAdditionally, cell 1 is already uncovered and isolated, so it stays.\\nSo at least 2 uncovered.\\nCan Bob prevent more than 2? He might, but Alice doesn't care, as long as she gets at least 2.\\nBut in this case, the large segment has size 2019, odd, so at least one uncovered, plus cell 1, total at least 2.\\nBut could there be more? Possibly, but Bob will try to minimize, so he might achieve exactly one in the large segment, total 2.\\nCan he achieve that?\\nOn an odd-length segment, the first player (Bob) might be able to force only one uncovered.\\nFor example, in size 3,5,7, we saw that the first player can force exactly one uncovered.\\nSimilarly, perhaps for any odd n, the first player can force exactly one uncovered.\\nSimilarly for even n>=4, the first player (if Alice) can force 2, but if Bob is first on even n, he might force 0, as in n=4,6,8.\\nIn n=4, Bob first can force 0.\\nn=6, Bob first can force 0.\\nBut for odd n, first player cannot force 0, since odd, must have at least one uncovered, and can force exactly one.\\nSo in this case, after Alice covers 2,3, leaving cell 1 isolated and segment 4-2022 of size 2019 (odd), Bob to move on it.\\nBob can force that this segment has exactly one uncovered square.\\nThus total uncovered: 1 (cell 1) + 1 (from segment) = 2.\\nIf Alice does nothing, Bob might cover everything, but she acts.\\nIs there a way for Alice to force more than 2?\\nSuppose she tries to create two isolated cells.\\nFor example, if she could make cell 1 and cell 2022 isolated.\\nBut to isolate cell 2022, she needs to cover 2021, but if she covers 2021,2022, then it's covered, not isolated.\\nTo isolate cell 2022, she needs cell 2021 covered, but 2022 not covered.\\nBut she can't cover 2021 without covering 2022 or 2020.\\nSuppose she covers 2020,2021, then cell 2022 is isolated, but she used a tile.\\nSimilarly, she can cover 2,3 to isolate cell 1, and cover 2020,2021 to isolate cell 2022.\\nBut she can't do both in one move.\\nOn her first move, she can only do one.\\nSuppose on first move, she covers 2,3, isolating cell 1.\\nThen Bob moves.\\nBob might cover somewhere in the middle, or at the other end.\\nIf Bob covers 2020,2021, then cell 2022 is isolated, so now two isolated cells: 1 and 2022.\\nThen the middle segment from 4 to 2019, size 2016, even.\\nThen Alice moves on it.\\nOn even size, she might be able to force 2 uncovered, but Bob will try to minimize.\\nOn size 2016 even, Alice to move, v(2016)=2, as per pattern, so she can force 2 uncovered in the middle.\\nPlus the two isolated, total 4 uncovered.\\nBut Bob doesn't want that.\\nSo Bob, after Alice isolates cell 1, will not isolate cell 2022; instead, he will play in a way to prevent further isolation.\\nFor example, Bob could cover 1,2? But cell 1 is already there, but 1 and 2: cell 2 is already covered? No, Alice covered 2 and 3, so cell 2 is covered, so Bob cannot cover 1,2 because cell 2 is covered.\\nSimilarly, he cannot touch cell 1.\\nSo he must play in cells 4 to 2022.\\nNow, if he covers, say, 4,5, then no isolation yet.\\nOr if he covers 2021,2022, then he covers cell 2022, so it's covered, not isolated.\\nSo he can choose to cover the end, preventing isolation of cell 2022.\\nSimilarly, he can play anywhere.\\nBut in particular, he can ensure that no additional isolated cells are created, and on the odd-sized segment, he can force only one uncovered.\\nSo total uncovered: 1 (cell 1) + 1 (from segment) = 2.\\nIf Alice on her first move covers a different place, same thing.\\nSuppose she covers 1,2. Then Bob can cover 3,4, and so on, potentially covering everything, uncovered=0.\\nBut Alice won't do that.\\nSo by playing to isolate one end, she ensures at least 2 uncovered, and Bob can prevent more than 2, so the value is 2.\\nTherefore, for n=2022, Alice can ensure 2 uncovered squares.\\nSo answer is 2.\\n\\nBut earlier for n=4, it was 2, which is half, but for large n, 2 is constant.\\nYes.\\nSo final answers:\\n\\nProblem 1: the solutions are:\\n- n=1, k1=1\\n- n=3, k1,k2,k3 = 2,3,6 in some order\\n- n=4, k1=k2=k3=k4=4\\n\\nBut the problem asks to \"find all positive integers n, k1,...,kn\", so probably list the possibilities.\\nSince it's a math competition style, perhaps state the triples.\\n\\nBut for the answer, since it's to be boxed, perhaps describe.\\n\\nLooking back, the answer should be concise.\\n\\nWe can say: the solutions are (n=1; k1=1), (n=3; {2,3,6}), (n=4; {4,4,4,4})\\n\\nBut in the JSON, just state clearly.\\n\\nProblem 2: 2\\n\\nNow to box.\\n\\nBut in JSON format.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"The solutions are: (n=1, k_1=1); (n=3, k_1=2, k_2=3, k_3=6); (n=4, k_1=k_2=k_3=k_4=4)\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\"\n}",
