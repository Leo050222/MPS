  "math_problem": "Solve for $2d$ if $10d + 8 = 528$. Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance $s$ equal to that solution plus 48. Megan and Hana raced their remote control cars for $s$ m. The two cars started at the same time. The average speed of Megan's car was $\\frac{5}{4} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Hana's car finished 5 seconds before Megan's car. What was the average speed of Hana's car?",

Let's solve it step by step.\\n\\n### Step 1: Solve for $2d$ given the equation\\nWe are told:\\n\\n$$\\n10d + 8 = 528\\n$$\\n\\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\\n\\n$$\\n10d = 520\\n$$\\n\\nDivide both sides by 10:\\n\\n$$\\nd = 52\\n$$\\n\\nNow, compute $2d$:\\n\\n$$\\n2d = 2 \\\\times 52 = 104\\n$$\\n\\nBut instead of using $2d$, we are told to find:\\n\\n> the race distance $s$ equal to that solution plus 48\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\ns = 2d + 48 = 104 + 48 = 152\\n$$\\n\\nSo the race distance is $s = 152$ meters.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Analyze the race\\n\\n- Megan's car average speed: $\\\\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$ m/s\\n- Distance: $s = 152$ m\\n- Time taken by Megan: \\n\\n$$\\nt_M = \\\\frac{152}{1.25} = \\\\frac{152}{5/4} = 152 \\\\times \\\\frac{4}{5} = \\\\frac{608}{5} = 121.6 \\\\text{ seconds}\\n$$\\n\\nHana's car finished 5 seconds before Megan's:\\n\\n$$\\nt_H = 121.6 - 5 = 116.6 \\\\text{ seconds}\\n$$\\n\\nNow, Hana's car also traveled the same distance $s = 152$ m in 116.6 seconds.\\n\\nSo, average speed of Hana's car:\\n\\n$$\\nv_H = \\\\frac{152}{116.6}\\n$$\\n\\nLet’s compute this exactly.\\n\\nFirst, write 116.6 as a fraction:\\n\\n$$\\n116.6 = \\\\frac{1166}{10} = \\\\frac{583}{5}\\n$$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nv_H = \\\\frac{152}{583/5} = 152 \\\\times \\\\frac{5}{583} = \\\\frac{760}{583}\\n$$\\n\\nLet’s see if this simplifies.\\n\\nCheck GCD of 760 and 583.\\n\\n- 583 ÷ 11 = 53 → 11 × 53 = 583\\n- 760 = 76 × 10 = $2^3 \\\\times 5 \\\\times 19$\\n- 583 = 11 × 53\\n\\nNo common factors → fraction is already simplified.\\n\\nSo average speed of Hana's car is $\\\\frac{760}{583}$ m/s.\\n\\nBut let’s double-check everything numerically for accuracy.\\n\\nMegan:\\n- Speed: 1.25 m/s\\n- Distance: 152 m\\n- Time: 152 / 1.25 = 121.6 s → correct\\n- Hana's time: 121.6 - 5 = 116.6 s\\n- Hana's speed: 152 / 116.6 ≈ 1.3036 m/s\\n\\nNow compute $\\\\frac{760}{583}$:\\n\\n760 ÷ 583 ≈ 1.3036 → matches.\\n\\nSo the exact value is $\\\\frac{760}{583}$.\\n\\nHowever, let’s recheck whether $s = 152$ is correct.\\n\\nWe had:\\n- $10d + 8 = 528$\\n- $10d = 520$ → $d = 52$\\n- $2d = 104$\\n- $s = 2d + 48 = 104 + 48 = 152$ → correct.\\n\\nAll steps verified.\",\n    \"answer\": \"760/583\"\n}",
