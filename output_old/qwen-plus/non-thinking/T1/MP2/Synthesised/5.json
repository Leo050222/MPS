  "math_problem": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$. Shuxin begins with $d$ red candies, 7 yellow candies, and 3 blue candies. After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining. What is the smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-step problem. Let's solve it step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Understand the ratio and difference between skateboards and bicycles.**\n\nThe ratio of skateboards to bicycles is $7:4$.  \nLet the number of skateboards be $7k$, and the number of bicycles be $4k$, for some positive integer $k$.\n\nWe're told there were 12 more skateboards than bicycles:\n\n$$\n7k - 4k = 12 \\Rightarrow 3k = 12 \\Rightarrow k = 4\n$$\n\nSo:\n- Skateboards: $7k = 28$\n- Bicycles: $4k = 16$\n- Total: $28 + 16 = 44$\n\nBut we are **not** asked for the total. Instead, we are told to compute:\n\n> $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor.\n\nWe found $k = 4$, so:\n\n$$\nd = 4 + 6 = 10\n$$\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Shuxin has candies.**\n\nShuxin begins with:\n- $d = 10$ red candies,\n- 7 yellow candies,\n- 3 blue candies.\n\nSo:\n- Red: 10\n- Yellow: 7\n- Blue: 3\n\nAfter eating some candies, the number of remaining red, yellow, and blue candies are equal.\n\nWe are to find the **smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate** such that the remaining counts are equal.\n\nLet $x$ be the number of each color remaining. Since she can only eat candies (not gain), the remaining number of each color must satisfy:\n\n- $x \\leq 10$ (red)\n- $x \\leq 7$ (yellow)\n- $x \\leq 3$ (blue)\n\nSo the maximum possible value for $x$ is $\\min(10, 7, 3) = 3$\n\nTo minimize the number eaten, we want to **maximize** the number remaining, because:\n\n$$\n\\text{Candies eaten} = (10 - x) + (7 - x) + (3 - x) = 20 - 3x\n$$\n\nTo minimize this, we maximize $x$. The largest possible $x$ is 3.\n\nTry $x = 3$:\n- Remaining: 3 red, 3 yellow, 3 blue\n- Eaten: $10 - 3 = 7$ red? Wait — no, we don't care which ones are eaten, just how many.\n\nWait: She starts with 10 red, 7 yellow, 3 blue.\n\nIf $x = 3$, then:\n- Red eaten: $10 - 3 = 7$\n- Yellow eaten: $7 - 3 = 4$\n- Blue eaten: $3 - 3 = 0$\n- Total eaten: $7 + 4 + 0 = 11$\n\nCan we have $x > 3$? No, because blue only has 3.\n\nIs $x = 3$ possible? Yes — she doesn’t need to eat blue candies, just eat 7 red and 4 yellow.\n\nIs there a way to eat fewer than 11 candies?\n\nSuppose she leaves $x = 2$: then eats $8 + 5 + 1 = 14$ → more than 11.\n\n$x = 1$: $9 + 6 + 2 = 17$\n\n$x = 0$: $10 + 7 + 3 = 20$\n\nSo minimum occurs at $x = 3$, total eaten = 11.\n\nBut wait — is $x = 3$ allowed? Yes: she can leave 3 of each. She has exactly 3 blue, so she eats none of them. She eats 4 yellow (from 7 to 3), and 7 red (from 10 to 3). All valid.\n\nThus, the **smallest possible number of candies eaten** is 11.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer: 11\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
