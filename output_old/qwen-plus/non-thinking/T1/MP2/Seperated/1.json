To find when she turned it on, we subtract 100 hours from 5 p.m. Friday.\\n\\nFirst, divide 100 by 24 to find how many full days and extra hours: \\n100 ÷ 24 = 4 days and 4 hours (since 4 × 24 = 96, and 100 − 96 = 4).\\n\\nSo, we go back 4 full days and 4 hours from 5 p.m. Friday.\\n\\n- 1 day before Friday is Thursday (5 p.m.)\\n- 2 days before is Wednesday (5 p.m.)\\n- 3 days before is Tuesday (5 p.m.)\\n- 4 days before is Monday (5 p.m.)\\n\\nNow subtract the remaining 4 hours: 5 p.m. minus 4 hours is 1 p.m.\\n\\nSo, the computer was turned on at 1 p.m. on Monday.\\n\\nProblem 2: We are given the list: 2, 3, 4, 6. We need to pick three different numbers whose sum is 11.\\n\\nTry all combinations of three numbers:\\n- 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 → too small\\n- 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 → correct\\n- 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 → too big\\n- 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 → too big\\n\\nOnly 2, 3, 6 sum to 11.\\n\\nTheir product is: 2 × 3 × 6 = 6 × 6 = 36.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1 p.m. Monday\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"36\"\n}",
