We are told this sum is 27, so 3n = 27 → n = 9. Therefore, the three integers are 8, 9, and 10. Now multiply them: 8 × 9 × 10 = 720.\\n\\nProblem 2: We are told that x% of 60 is 12. This means (x/100) × 60 = 12. Solving: (60x)/100 = 12 → 60x = 1200 → x = 20. Now find 15% of x: 15% of 20 = (15/100) × 20 = 3.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"720\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
