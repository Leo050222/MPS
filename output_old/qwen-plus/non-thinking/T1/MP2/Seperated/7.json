Four of these regions each have a central angle of $x^\\\\circ$, and the remaining two regions have central angles of $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$. The total central angle in a circle is $360^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nSo, we can write the equation:\\n\\n$$\\n4x + 20 + 140 = 360\\n$$\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n$$\\n4x + 160 = 360\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n4x = 200 \\\\Rightarrow x = 50\\n$$\\n\\nSo each of the four regions has a central angle of $50^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nNow, we need to find the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region. However, the problem does not specify which regions are shaded. But since the question asks for *the* probability, it implies that the shading is defined by context — likely, the non-$x$ regions or some specific ones.\\n\\nWait — rereading: it says \\\"a circular spinner is divided into six regions\\\":\\n- 4 regions with $x^\\\\circ$\\n- One with $20^\\\\circ$\\n- One with $140^\\\\circ$\\n\\nSo total: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 regions.\\n\\nBut the problem doesn't say which are shaded. This seems ambiguous. However, such problems usually imply that either the regions different from the rest are shaded, or perhaps the question is missing info.\\n\\nWait — actually, upon closer inspection, maybe the problem intends that only the two non-$x$ regions are special, but still — without knowing which are shaded, we cannot proceed.\\n\\nBut wait — perhaps I misread. Let me check again.\\n\\nThe problem says: \\\"What is the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region\\\" — but it never specifies which regions are shaded! That seems like a critical omission.\\n\\nBut this is a well-formed problem, so likely there's an assumption: perhaps all regions except the $x$-degree ones are shaded? Or vice versa?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is implying that the shaded regions are the ones mentioned separately — i.e., the $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$ regions? That would make sense — the four identical ones are unshaded, and the two distinct ones are shaded.\\n\\nThat is a reasonable interpretation: the two regions with specified angles (20° and 140°) are the shaded ones.\\n\\nSo total shaded angle = $20 + 140 = 160^\\\\circ$\\n\\nTotal circle = $360^\\\\circ$\\n\\nSo probability = $\\\\frac{160}{360} = \\\\frac{4}{9}$\\n\\nAlternatively, if the four $x=50^\\\\circ$ regions are shaded, total shaded = $4 \\\\times 50 = 200^\\\\circ$, probability = $200/360 = 5/9$\\n\\nBut without specification, we must rely on convention.\\n\\nLooking at similar problems: when some regions are grouped and others specified individually, often the individually specified ones are the focus.\\n\\nBut here's another thought: perhaps the problem meant that four regions have angle $x$, one has $20^\\\\circ$, and one has $140^\\\\circ$, and the shaded regions are, say, the four equal ones? But again, no clue.\\n\\nWait — perhaps the diagram is missing, but in text-based problems like this, sometimes \\\"shaded\\\" refers to regions that are not standard. But we need more.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe \\\"shaded\\\" is defined via the value of the angle? Unlikely.\\n\\nWait — let's suppose that the problem forgot to say which are shaded. But that can't be — it's asking for a numerical answer.\\n\\nAlternative idea: maybe \\\"the shaded region\\\" refers to a single region? But it says \\\"a shaded region\\\", and there are multiple regions.\\n\\nWait — unless only one region is shaded? But again, unspecified.\\n\\nThis is problematic.\\n\\nBut let's look at the sum:\\n\\nWe found $x = 50^\\\\circ$. So the six regions are:\\n- Four of $50^\\\\circ$: total $200^\\\\circ$\\n- One of $20^\\\\circ$\\n- One of $140^\\\\circ$\\n\\nTotal: $200 + 20 + 140 = 360^\\\\circ$ — correct.\\n\\nNow, perhaps the shaded regions are the ones with angles $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$? That totals $160^\\\\circ$, probability $160/360 = 4/9$.\\n\\nOr maybe the four $50^\\\\circ$ ones are shaded: $200/360 = 5/9$.\\n\\nBut let's see if there's another clue.\\n\\nWait — the problem says \\\"the arrow stops on a shaded region\\\" — singular \\\"a\\\", but that doesn't help.\\n\\nPerhaps in the original context (e.g., a figure), the shaded regions are indicated. Since it's not here, we must infer.\\n\\nBut consider: if four regions are identical and two are different, often the different ones are shaded to draw attention.\\n\\nBut alternatively, maybe the large $140^\\\\circ$ region is shaded, and others not? Then probability $140/360 = 7/18$.\\n\\nToo many possibilities.\\n\\nWait — perhaps I missed something: the problem might be implying that the four regions of $x^\\\\circ$ are unshaded, and the other two are shaded? That’s possible.\\n\\nBut let's search for symmetry or standard interpretations.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps \\\"shaded\\\" is not specified because it's part of a figure, but in many such problems, when angles are given like this, and probability is asked, the shaded area is the sum of the explicitly named non-x regions.\\n\\nMoreover, 20 and 140 add to 160, and 160/360 = 4/9.\\n\\nBut let's suppose instead that the four x-degree regions are shaded. Then 4×50 = 200, 200/360 = 5/9.\\n\\nWhich one is more likely?\\n\\nWait — perhaps the problem is from a source where typically the majority or the symmetric ones are shaded.\\n\\nBut without more, this is ambiguous.\\n\\nWait — let's read the problem again carefully:\\n\\n\\\"a circular spinner is divided into six regions, four regions each have a central angle of x°, and the remaining regions have central angles of 20° and 140°\\\"\\n\\nSo the four are described collectively, the other two individually.\\n\\nNow, if the question is about shaded region, and no info, perhaps we are to assume that \\\"shaded\\\" means the regions that are not among the four? That is, the two specified ones are shaded.\\n\\nThis is a common setup: \\\"the rest\\\" are shaded.\\n\\nFor example, \\\"a pie is divided into 6 slices; 4 are small, one is medium, one is large — what's the chance of getting a non-small slice?\\\"\\n\\nSo likely, the shaded regions are the two that are not part of the group of four.\\n\\nThus, shaded angle = 20 + 140 = 160°\\n\\nProbability = 160 / 360 = 4/9\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 1: $\\\\frac{4}{9}$\\n\\nNow, Problem 2:\\n\\nWe are told that a pair $(m,n)$ is a happy pair if $\\\\gcd(m,n)$ is a perfect square.\\n\\nGiven: $(205800, 35k)$ is a happy pair, and $k$ is a positive integer with $k \\\\leq 2940$.\\n\\nWe need to find the number of such $k$.\\n\\nFirst, factorize the numbers.\\n\\nStart with 205800.\\n\\n205800 = 2058 × 100\\n\\n100 = $2^2 \\\\times 5^2$\\n\\n2058: divide by 2: 1029\\n\\n1029: divisible by 3: 1+0+2+9=12 → yes, 1029 ÷ 3 = 343\\n\\n343 = $7^3$\\n\\nSo 1029 = $3 \\\\times 7^3$\\n\\nThus 2058 = $2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 7^3$\\n\\nSo 205800 = $2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 7^3 \\\\times 2^2 \\\\times 5^2 = 2^3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5^2 \\\\times 7^3$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n205800 = 2^3 \\\\times 3^1 \\\\times 5^2 \\\\times 7^3\\n$$\\n\\nNow, $35k = 5 \\\\times 7 \\\\times k$\\n\\nLet $k$ have prime factorization involving primes 2,3,5,7, and possibly others.\\n\\nLet $n = 35k = 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot k$\\n\\nWe need $\\\\gcd(205800, 35k)$ to be a perfect square.\\n\\nLet $d = \\\\gcd(205800, 35k)$\\n\\nSince $d$ divides 205800, its prime factors are only 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nSo $d = 2^a \\\\times 3^b \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7^d$, and we need $a,b,c,d$ all even (since perfect square).\\n\\nNow, $d = \\\\gcd(2^3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5^2 \\\\times 7^3,\\\\ 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot k)$\\n\\nSo the exponents in the gcd are:\\n\\n- For prime 2: $\\\\min(3, v_2(35k)) = \\\\min(3, v_2(k))$ since 35 is odd\\n- For prime 3: $\\\\min(1, v_3(35k)) = \\\\min(1, v_3(k))$\\n- For prime 5: $\\\\min(2, v_5(35k)) = \\\\min(2, 1 + v_5(k))$\\n- For prime 7: $\\\\min(3, v_7(35k)) = \\\\min(3, 1 + v_7(k))$\\n\\nAnd for any other prime $p$, $v_p(d) = 0$, which is even, so no issue.\\n\\nWe need each of these min values to be even.\\n\\nSo let's denote:\\n\\nLet $a = v_2(k)$, $b = v_3(k)$, $c = v_5(k)$, $d = v_7(k)$, and for other primes, they don't affect the gcd (since 205800 has no other primes), so $v_p(k)$ for $p > 7$ can be anything, but they don't contribute to the gcd, so the gcd remains unaffected by extra prime factors in $k$ beyond 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nBut wait: if $k$ has a prime factor $p \\\\notin \\\\{2,3,5,7\\\\}$, then $35k$ has that prime, but 205800 does not, so $\\\\gcd$ is not divisible by $p$, so it doesn't affect the gcd. So indeed, only the exponents of 2,3,5,7 in $k$ matter for the value of the gcd.\\n\\nTherefore, the condition depends only on $v_2(k), v_3(k), v_5(k), v_7(k)$.\\n\\nNow, we require:\\n\\n1. $\\\\min(3, a)$ is even  → $a = v_2(k)$\\n   - $\\\\min(3,a)$ even: possible values: 0,2 (since 1,3 are odd)\\n   - So $\\\\min(3,a) = 0$ or $2$\\n   - If $\\\\min(3,a)=0$ → $a=0$\\n   - If $\\\\min(3,a)=2$ → $a \\\\geq 2$, and since min is 2, $a$ can be 2 or more, but min(3,a)=2 implies $a \\\\geq 2$ and since 3>a would give min=a, but min=2, so either a=2 or a≥3 but min=3 if a≥3, which is odd — not allowed.\\n     - Wait: if a ≥ 3, min(3,a)=3, which is odd → not allowed.\\n     - So min(3,a) must be 0 or 2.\\n     - min=0 → a=0\\n     - min=2 → then min(3,a)=2 → this happens when a=2 (since if a≥3, min=3)\\n     - So a must be 0 or 2.\\n\\n   Thus $v_2(k) = 0$ or $2$\\n\\n2. $\\\\min(1, b)$ is even, where $b = v_3(k)$\\n   - min(1,b): possible values: if b=0, min=0; if b≥1, min=1\\n   - 0 is even, 1 is odd\\n   - So we need min=0 → so b=0\\n   - Thus $v_3(k) = 0$\\n\\n3. $\\\\min(2, 1 + c)$ is even, where $c = v_5(k)$\\n   - Let $e = 1 + c = v_5(35k) = 1 + v_5(k)$\\n   - min(2,e) must be even\\n   - Possible even values: 0,2 (but min ≥0, and since e≥1, min≥1, so min=2 (only even possibility ≥1)\\n   - min=0 impossible because e≥1, so min≥1\\n   - min=1 is odd → not allowed\\n   - min=2 is even → allowed\\n   - So min(2,e)=2 → this means e ≥2 (so that min is 2)\\n   - Since min(2,e)=2 iff e≥2\\n   - So e≥2 → 1+c ≥2 → c≥1\\n   - So $v_5(k) \\\\geq 1$\\n\\n4. $\\\\min(3, 1 + d)$ is even, where $d = v_7(k)$\\n   - Let $f = 1 + d = v_7(35k)$\\n   - min(3,f) must be even\\n   - Possible even values: 0,2 (4>3 not possible)\\n   - min=0: requires f=0, but f=1+d ≥1 → impossible\\n   - min=2: possible if min(3,f)=2 → this happens when f=2 (since if f<3, min=f; if f≥3, min=3)\\n     - So min=2 iff f=2\\n     - Because if f=1, min=1 (odd); f=2, min=2 (even); f≥3, min=3 (odd)\\n   - So only possibility: f=2 → 1+d=2 → d=1\\n   - Thus $v_7(k) = 1$\\n\\nSummary of conditions on $k$:\\n\\n- $v_2(k) = 0$ or $2$\\n- $v_3(k) = 0$\\n- $v_5(k) \\\\geq 1$\\n- $v_7(k) = 1$\\n\\nAdditionally, $k$ may have other prime factors (like 11,13,etc.), but their exponents can be arbitrary, as they don't affect the gcd.\\n\\nBut we have the constraint $k \\\\leq 2940$\\n\\nSo we need to count the number of positive integers $k \\\\leq 2940$ satisfying:\\n\\n- $k$ is not divisible by 3\\n- $k$ is divisible by $5^1 = 5$, but higher powers allowed\\n- $k$ is divisible by $7^1 = 7$, but not by $7^2 = 49$ (since $v_7(k)=1$ exactly)\\n- $v_2(k) = 0$ or $2$, i.e., $k$ is odd or divisible by 4 but not by 8? No:\\n  - $v_2(k)=0$: odd\\n  - $v_2(k)=2$: divisible by 4, but not by 8? No: $v_2(k)=2$ means divisible by $2^2=4$, but not by $2^3=8$? Actually, no: $v_2(k)=2$ means exactly exponent 2, so divisible by 4, not by 8.\\n\\nBut wait: earlier we said $v_2(k)$ must be 0 or 2 — exactly?\\n\\nYes: because if $v_2(k)=1$, then $\\\\min(3,1)=1$, odd — not allowed.\\nIf $v_2(k)=3$, $\\\\min(3,3)=3$, odd — not allowed.\\nIf $v_2(k)=4$, $\\\\min(3,4)=3$, odd — not allowed.\\nOnly $v_2(k)=0$ or $2$ give min=0 or 2, both even.\\n\\nSo $v_2(k)$ must be exactly 0 or exactly 2.\\n\\nSimilarly, $v_7(k)$ must be exactly 1.\\n\\n$v_3(k)$ must be exactly 0.\\n\\n$v_5(k)$ must be at least 1, i.e., $\\\\geq 1$, so $5 \\\\mid k$.\\n\\nSo conditions:\\n\\n- $2^2 \\\\parallel k$ or $2^0 \\\\parallel k$ — i.e., $k$ divisible by 1 or 4, but:\\n  - Either $k$ odd ($v_2=0$)\\n  - Or $k$ divisible by 4 but not by 8 ($v_2=2$)\\n- $3 \\\\nmid k$\\n- $5 \\\\mid k$\\n- $7 \\\\parallel k$ — i.e., $7 \\\\mid k$ but $49 \\\\nmid k$\\n- $k \\\\leq 2940$\\n\\nAlso, $k$ can have other prime factors: 11,13,17,etc., as long as the above are satisfied.\\n\\nSo we need to count such $k$.\\n\\nLet $k = 2^a \\\\times 5^b \\\\times 7 \\\\times m$, where:\\n- $a = 0$ or $2$\\n- $b \\\\geq 1$\\n- $m$ is an integer coprime to 2,3,5,7 — i.e., $\\\\gcd(m, 2\\\\cdot3\\\\cdot5\\\\cdot7)=1$, so $m$ not divisible by 2,3,5,7\\n\\nBut wait: $m$ could be divisible by other primes, but we must ensure that $v_2(k)=a$, $v_3(k)=0$, $v_5(k)=b$, $v_7(k)=1$, so yes, $m$ must be coprime to 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nActually, $m$ should not introduce new factors of 2,3,5,7, so $\\\\gcd(m, 210)=1$, since $2\\\\cdot3\\\\cdot5\\\\cdot7=210$.\\n\\nSo $k = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^b \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot m$, with:\\n- $a \\\\in \\\\{0, 2\\\\}$\\n- $b \\\\geq 1$\\n- $m \\\\geq 1$, $\\\\gcd(m, 210) = 1$\\n- And $k \\\\leq 2940$\\n\\nNow, since $b \\\\geq 1$, let $b' = b$, starting from 1.\\n\\nWe can write $k = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^b \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot m = 7 \\\\cdot 2^a \\\\cdot 5^b \\\\cdot m$\\n\\nSet $c = 2^a$, so $c=1$ if $a=0$, $c=4$ if $a=2$\\n\\nSo $k = 7 \\\\cdot c \\\\cdot 5^b \\\\cdot m$\\n\\nNow $c \\\\in \\\\{1,4\\\\}$\\n\\nWe need $k \\\\leq 2940$, so:\\n\\n$$\\n7 \\\\cdot c \\\\cdot 5^b \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 2940\\n$$\\n\\nDivide both sides by 7:\\n\\n$$\\nc \\\\cdot 5^b \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 420\\n$$\\n\\nSince $2940 / 7 = 420$\\n\\nSo $c \\\\cdot 5^b \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 420$, with $c=1$ or $4$, $b \\\\geq 1$, $m \\\\geq 1$, $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$\\n\\nNote that $c$ and $5^b$ are composed of primes 2 and 5, and $m$ is coprime to 2,3,5,7, so no overlap.\\n\\nWe can iterate over possible $b$ and $c$.\\n\\nFirst, $b \\\\geq 1$\\n\\nTry $b=1$: $5^1=5$\\nThen $c \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 420$ → $c \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 84$\\n\\n$c=1$ or $4$\\n\\nCase 1: $c=1$ → $m \\\\leq 84$, $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$\\n\\nCase 2: $c=4$ → $4m \\\\leq 84$ → $m \\\\leq 21$, $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$\\n\\nNow $b=2$: $5^2=25$\\nThen $c \\\\cdot 25 \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 420$ → $c \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 420 / 25 = 16.8$, so $\\\\leq 16$\\n\\nSo $c m \\\\leq 16$\\n\\n$c=1$ or $4$\\n\\n- $c=1$: $m \\\\leq 16$, $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$\\n- $c=4$: $4m \\\\leq 16$ → $m \\\\leq 4$, $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$\\n\\n$b=3$: $5^3=125$\\n$c \\\\cdot 125 \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 420$ → $c m \\\\leq 420 / 125 = 3.36$, so $\\\\leq 3$\\n\\n- $c=1$: $m \\\\leq 3$, $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$\\n- $c=4$: $4m \\\\leq 3$ → $m \\\\leq 0.75$, but $m \\\\geq 1$, impossible\\n\\nSo only $c=1$, $m \\\\leq 3$\\n\\n$b=4$: $5^4=625$\\n$c \\\\cdot 625 \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 420$ → $c m \\\\leq 420 / 625 < 1$, so $<1$, but $c \\\\geq 1$, $m \\\\geq 1$, so $c m \\\\geq 1$, impossible.\\n\\nHigher $b$ worse.\\n\\nSo only $b=1,2,3$\\n\\nNow, we need to count the number of $m$ for each case, with $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$ and the inequalities.\\n\\nFirst, recall that $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$ means $m$ not divisible by 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nWe'll compute for each $(b,c)$ pair.\\n\\nStart with $b=1$:\\n\\n- $c=1$: $m \\\\leq 84$, $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$\\n- $c=4$: $m \\\\leq 21$, $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$\\n\\n$b=2$:\\n\\n- $c=1$: $m \\\\leq 16$, $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$\\n- $c=4$: $m \\\\leq 4$, $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$\\n\\n$b=3$:\\n\\n- $c=1$: $m \\\\leq 3$, $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$\\n- $c=4$: impossible\\n\\nNow, count the number of positive integers $m$ in each range coprime to 210.\\n\\nSince 210 = 2×3×5×7, we use inclusion-exclusion or just list, as ranges are small.\\n\\nDefine $\\\\phi(n)$ but for counting up to N coprime to M.\\n\\nUse inclusion-exclusion for each.\\n\\nLet $S(N) = $ number of positive integers $\\\\leq N$ coprime to 210.\\n\\nSince 210 is fixed, we can compute $S(N)$ using inclusion-exclusion over the primes 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nThe number of integers $\\\\leq N$ not divisible by 2,3,5,7 is:\\n\\n$$\\nS(N) = \\\\sum_{d|210} \\\\mu(d) \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{N}{d} \\\\right\\\\rfloor\\n$$\\n\\nWhere $\\\\mu$ is the Möbius function.\\n\\nDivisors of 210: 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14,15,21,30,35,42,70,105,210\\n\\n$\\\\mu(d)$: \\n- $\\\\mu(1)=1$\\n- $\\\\mu(p)=-1$ for prime p\\n- $\\\\mu(pq)=+1$ for distinct primes\\n- $\\\\mu(pqr)=-1$\\n- $\\\\mu(pqrs)=+1$\\n\\nSo:\\n- d=1: μ=1\\n- d=2,3,5,7: μ=-1\\n- d=6=2×3,10=2×5,14=2×7,15=3×5,21=3×7,35=5×7: μ=+1\\n- d=30=2×3×5,42=2×3×7,70=2×5×7,105=3×5×7: μ=-1\\n- d=210=2×3×5×7: μ=+1\\n\\nNow compute for each required N.\\n\\nFirst, $b=1, c=1$: $m \\\\leq 84$\\n\\n$S(84) = $\\n\\nCompute floor(N/d) for each d:\\n\\n- d=1: floor(84/1)=84\\n- d=2: 42\\n- d=3: 28\\n- d=5: 16\\n- d=6: 14\\n- d=7: 12\\n- d=10: 8\\n- d=14: 6\\n- d=15: 5\\n- d=21: 4\\n- d=30: 2\\n- d=35: 2\\n- d=42: 2\\n- d=70: 1\\n- d=105: 0 (84/105<1)\\n- d=210: 0\\n\\nNow apply μ:\\n\\nS(84) = \\n+1*(84)  \\n+ (-1)*(42 + 28 + 16 + 12) = -

For example, could the same k be counted in two different cases?\\n\\nNo, because b is the exponent of 5 in k, which is fixed for each k, and c determines v_2(k), which is also fixed. So each k has unique b and a (hence c), and m is the cofactor, so no overlap.\\n\\nThus total 30 such k.\\n\\nBut k ≤ 2940, and we have ensured k = 7 * c * 5^b * m ≤ 2940 via the inequality.\\n\\nNow, verify with an example.\\n\\nFor instance, smallest k: b=1, c=1, m=1: k=7 *1*5*1=35\\nCheck: v2=0 (odd), v3=0, v5=1≥1, v7=1 → good.\\ngcd(205800, 35*35)=gcd(205800,1225)\\n35k=35*35=1225\\n205800 and 1225.\\nFactor: 1225=25*49=5^2*7^2\\n205800=2^3*3*5^2*7^3\\ngcd=5^2 * 7^2 = 25*49=1225, which is (5*7)^2=35^2, perfect square. Good.\\n\\nAnother: b=1,c=4,m=1: k=7*4*5*1=140\\nv2(k)=v2(140)=v2(4*35)=2, good; v3=0; v5=1; v7=1\\n35k=35*140=4900\\ngcd(205800,4900)\\n4900=100*49=2^2*5^2*7^2\\n205800=2^3*3*5^2*7^3\\ngcd=2^2 * 5^2 * 7^2 = 4*25*49=4900, which is (2*5*7)^2=70^2, perfect square. Good.\\n\\nNow, largest possible? b=3,c=1,m=3: k=7*1*125*3=7*125*3=875*3=2625 ≤2940\\n35k=35*2625=91875\\nBut gcd: k=2625= 2625÷25=105, 105÷5=21, better: 2625÷5=525,÷5=105,÷5=21,÷3=7,÷7=1 → 3*5^3*7\\nSo v2(k)=0 (odd), v3=1? Wait! v3(k)=1, but we require v3(k)=0!\\nMistake!\\nm=3, but gcd(m,210)=1? 3 and 210, gcd=3≠1! Oh no!\\n\\nI forgot: m must be coprime to 210, so not divisible by 3.\\n\\nIn b=3,c=1: m≤3, and gcd(m,210)=1\\nm=1,2,3\\nm=1: gcd(1,210)=1 → ok\\nm=2: gcd(2,210)=2≠1 → not allowed\\nm=3: gcd(3,210)=3≠1 → not allowed\\nSo only m=1\\n\\nBut earlier I computed S(3)=1, which is correct, only m=1.\\n\\nIn my calculation, S(3)=1, so only m=1, which is fine.\\n\\nk=7*1*125*1=875\\nv2=0 (odd), v3=0 (875÷5=175,÷5=35,÷5=7, so 5^3*7, no 3), v5=3≥1, v7=1 → good.\\n\\n35k=35*875=30625\\ngcd(205800,30625)\\n205800=2^3*3*5^2*7^3\\n30625: 875*35= (125*7)* (5*7)= 125*5 *49= 625*49? 125*5=625, yes, 625*49.\\n625=5^4, 49=7^2, so 5^4 * 7^2\\nBut k=875=125*7=5^3*7, 35k=35*875=5*7 * 5^3*7=5^4 * 7^2\\ngcd with 2^3*3*5^2*7^3 = 5^2 * 7^2 = 25*49=1225, which is 35^2, perfect square. Good.\\n\\nNow, in b=1,c=1: m≤84, gcd(m,210)=1, we had 20 values, all good.\\n\\nBut in that case, for example m=11, k=7*1*5*11=385\\nv2=0, v3=0 (385÷5=77, 77÷7=11, so 5*7*11), v5=1, v7=1 → good.\\n\\nAll seem correct.\\n\\nNow, total: 20 (b1c1) + 5 (b1c4) + 3 (b2c1) + 1 (b2c4) + 1 (b3c1) = 20+5=25, +3=28, +1=29, +1=30.\\n\\nBut earlier I said 30.\\n\\nIs there any constraint I missed?\\n\\nk ≤ 2940, and we have k = 7*c*5^b*m ≤ 2940, and we used c*5^b*m ≤ 420, which is equivalent.\\n\\nLargest k: for example, b=1,c=1,m=83: k=7*1*5*83=7*5=35, 35*83=2905 ≤2940\\nm=83, gcd(83,210)=1? 83 prime, not 2,3,5,7 → yes.\\nv2(k)=v2(2905): 2905 odd →0, good; v3: 2+9+0+5=16 not div3 →0; v5: ends with 5 →1; v7: 2905÷7=415, since 7*415=2905? 7*400=2800, 7*15=105, total 2905 → yes, so v7=1 → good.\\n\\n35k=35*2905, but gcd will include 5^1 and 7^1 at least, but anyway, the exponent conditions are satisfied.\\n\\nAnother large: b=1,c=4,m=21? But m≤21 for b1c4, but m=21, gcd(21,210)=21≠1 → not included, since S(21)=5 includes only 1,11,13,17,19.\\n\\nm=19: k=7*4*5*19=7*4=28, 28*5=140, 140*19=2660 ≤2940\\nGood.\\n\\nb=2,c=1,m=13: k=7*1*25*13=7*25=175, 175*13=2275\\nGood.\\n\\nb=2,c=4,m=1: k=7*4*25*1=700\\nGood.\\n\\nb=3,c=1,m=1: k=875\\n\\nAll under 2940.\\n\\nIs there k with higher b? b=4: 5^4=625, k=7*c*625*m ≥7*1*625*1=4375>2940, too big, correctly excluded.\\n\\nNow, total 30.\\n\\nBut wait: in b=1,c=1: 20 options\\nb=1,c=4:5\\nb=2,c=1:3\\nb=2,c=4:1\\nb=3,c=1:1\\nSum: 20+5=25, 25+3=28, 28+1=29, 29+1=30.\\n\\nBut earlier when I listed for S(3), only m=1, but is m=1 allowed? Yes.\\n\\nBut in b=3,c=1, m=1: k=875, as above.\\n\\nNow, but k must be positive integer, which it is.\\n\\nSo total 30 values.\\n\\nBut let me confirm the sum:\\n- b=1: c=1:20, c=4:5 → 25\\n- b=2: c=1:3, c=4:1 →4\\n- b=3: c=1:1 →1\\nTotal: 25+4+1=30\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nBut is there a possibility that for some m, k exceeds 2940? No, because we derived the inequality strictly.\\n\\nFor example, b=1,c=1,m=84: but m=84, gcd(84,210)=42≠1, not included. Largest m in that group is 83, k=7*5*83=35*83=2905<2940.\\n\\nb=1,c=4,m=21: m=21 not coprime, largest is m=19, k=7*4*5*19=140*19=2660<2940.\\n\\nb=2,c=1,m=16: but m≤16, gcd=1: m=1,11,13 → k=7*25*13=2275<2940\\n\\nb=2,c=4,m=4: m≤4, gcd=1: only m=1, k=7*4*25*1=700\\n\\nb=3,c=1,m=1:875\\n\\nAll good.\\n\\nSo answer is 30.\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"the number of possible values of k with k ≤ 2940\\\"\\n\\nWe have 30 such k.\\n\\nBut let me see if k=35 is included: yes, b=1,c=1,m=1\\n\\nk=140: b=1,c=4,m=1? k=7*4*5*1=140, yes.\\n\\nk=175: 175=25*7=5^2*7, so v2=0, v3=0, v5=2≥1, v7=1 → should be in b=2,c=1,m=1? k=7*1*25*1=175, and m=1, gcd(1,210)=1, and for b=2,c=1: m≤16, 1≤16, yes, included in the 3 for that group.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo total 30.\\n\\nBut earlier I thought S(16)=3: m=1,11,13\\nk=7*25*1=175, 7*25*11=1925, 7*25*13=2275, all ≤2940, good.\\n\\nSimilarly, others.\\n\\nSo final answers:\\nProblem 1: 4/9 (assuming the two non-x regions are shaded)\\nProblem 2: 30\\n\\nBut for Problem 1, is 4/9 correct?\\n\\nWe assumed that the shaded regions are the 20° and 140° ones, totaling 160°, so 160/360=4/9.\\n\\nBut could it be the four x-regions? 4*50=200°, 200/360=5/9.\\n\\nBut why would they be shaded? The problem doesn't specify.\\n\\nHowever, in many such problems, when most regions are the same and two are different, the different ones are shaded.\\n\\nMoreover, 140° is large, might be shaded.\\n\\nBut let's see the total: if the four are shaded, probability 5/9, if the two, 4/9.\\n\\nBut perhaps the problem intends that the regions with central angle x are shaded? But it doesn't say.\\n\\nAnother interpretation: perhaps \\\"shaded\\\" is defined in a diagram, but since not provided, we must assume based on common practice.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem is from a source where typically the smaller regions or something.\\n\\nBut 20° is small, 140° is large.\\n\\nPerhaps both non-50° regions are shaded.\\n\\nI think 4/9 is reasonable.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps only the 140° region is shaded? But then probability 140/360=7/18, but that seems less likely.\\n\\nOr the 20° and 50° ones, but no.\\n\\nGiven that it's a common type, and the answer is likely a simple fraction, both 4/9 and 5/9 are simple.\\n\\nBut let's see: if the four x-regions are identical and likely to be the same color, and the other two different, perhaps the two are shaded.\\n\\nMoreover, in the problem statement, it mentions \\\"four regions each have x°\\\" and \\\"the remaining regions\\\" have 20° and 140°, so the remaining are distinguished, so likely they are the shaded ones.\\n\\nI think 4/9 is correct.\\n\\nSo I'll go with that.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4/9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"30\"\n}",
