Megan's car has an average speed of 5/4 m/s.\\n\\nStep 1: Find the time Megan's car takes to finish 100 m.\\n\\nTime = Distance / Speed = 100 / (5/4) = 100 × (4/5) = 80 seconds.\\n\\nHana's car finishes 5 seconds earlier, so Hana's time = 80 - 5 = 75 seconds.\\n\\nStep 2: Find Hana's average speed.\\n\\nSpeed = Distance / Time = 100 / 75 = 4/3 m/s.\\n\\nSo, the average speed of Hana's car is 4/3 m/s.\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 2: 4/3\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"104\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4/3\"\n}",
