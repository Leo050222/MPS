  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We are given that x and y are positive integers such that x + y = 31. We want to maximize the product xy.\\n\\nTo maximize the product of two numbers with a fixed sum, the product is largest when the numbers are as close as possible to each other. Since x + y = 31 (an odd number), the closest integers are 15 and 16.\\n\\nCheck: 15 + 16 = 31 → valid.\\nProduct: 15 × 16 = 240.\\n\\nAny other pair (e.g., 14×17=238, 13×18=234, etc.) gives a smaller product. So the maximum product is 240.\\n\\nProblem 2: We are given two endpoints of a line segment: (-9, -2) and (6, 8). We want to find how many points on this segment have integer coordinates (lattice points).\\n\\nThe number of lattice points on a line segment between two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), including the endpoints, is given by gcd(|x₂ - x₁|, |y₂ - y₁|) + 1, provided the line has rational slope (which it does).\\n\\nCompute differences:\\nΔx = 6 - (-9) = 15\\nΔy = 8 - (-2) = 10\\n\\ngcd(15, 10) = 5\\n\\nSo the number of lattice points is 5 + 1 = 6.\\n\\nAlternatively, parametrize the segment:\\nx(t) = -9 + 15t\\ny(t) = -2 + 10t\\nfor t from 0 to 1.\\n\\nWe need x(t) and y(t) to be integers. This happens when t = k/d where d = gcd(15,10)=5, so t = 0, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1 → 6 values.\\n\\nThus, there are 6 integer-coordinate points on the segment.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"240\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
