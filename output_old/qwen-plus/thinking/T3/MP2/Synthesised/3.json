  "math_problem": "The coefficients of the polynomial \\(P(x)\\) are nonnegative integers, each less than 100. Given that \\(P(10)=331633\\) and \\(P(-10)=273373\\), compute \\(P(1)\\). Instead of determining the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial, simply find \\(k = a_3 - 27\\), where \\(a_3\\) is the coefficient of \\(x^3\\). Let $P$ and $A$ denote the perimeter and area respectively of a right triangle with relatively prime integer side-lengths. Find the largest possible integral value of $\\frac{P^{k}}{A}$.",
