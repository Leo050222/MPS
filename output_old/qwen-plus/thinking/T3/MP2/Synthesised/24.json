  "math_problem": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form. Determine all the roots, real or complex, of the system of simultaneous equations $x + y + z = m$, $x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = m$, $x^{m} + y^{m} + z^{m} = m$.",
