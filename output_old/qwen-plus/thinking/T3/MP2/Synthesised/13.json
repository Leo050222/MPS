  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be square with 4 digits, such that all its digits are less than 6. If we add 1 to each digit the resulting number is another square. Find $n$ Instead of identifying the 4-digit perfect square satisfying the digit increment condition, simply find $m = a - 42$, where $a$ is the integer whose square is that number. P is a polynomial. When P is divided by $x-1$, the remainder is -4 . When P is divided by $x-2$, the remainder is -1 . When $P$ is divided by $x-3$, the remainder is 4 . Determine the remainder when $P$ is divided by $x^{m}-6 x^{2}+11 x-6$.",
