Determine all functions $f:R^+$ $\\rightarrow$ $R^+$ such that for all positive real numbers $x$ and $y:$\n$$f(x+f(xy))+y=f(x)f(y)+1$$ Instead of determining all functions satisfying the given functional equation, simply find $d = f(1) - 1$, where $f(1)$ is the value of the function at $1$ for any such function $f$. Does there exist a finite set of real numbers such that the sum of their $k$th powers equals $k + d$ for each integer $k$ from $d$ to $9$?",
