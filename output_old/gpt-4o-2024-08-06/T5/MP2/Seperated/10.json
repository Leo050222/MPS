Because \\(x f(0)\\) assumes all real values (as \\(x\\) varies over \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)), \\(f\\) would be constant on all \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). A constant function \\(f(x) = c\\) plugged back into the equation gives:\n\\[\nc = y c + c^3,\n\\]\nwhich must hold for all \\(y\\). If \\(c \\neq 0\\), this is impossible since the right side depends on \\(y\\). If \\(c=0\\), then zero function:\n\\[\nf(x) = 0\n\\]\nfor all \\(x\\) is a solution.\n\nStep 3: So two cases:\n\n**Case 1:** \\(f(0) \\neq 0\\) leads to \\(f \\equiv 0\\).\n\n**Case 2:** \\(f(0) = 0.\\)\n\nThen from Step 1:\n\\[\nf(y^3) = (f(y))^3.\n\\]\n\nThis functional equation resembles \\(f(y^3) = (f(y))^3\\).\n\nStep 4: Substitute \\(x=1\\) in the original:\n\\[\nf(f(y) + y^3) = y f(1) + (f(y))^3.\n\\]\nFrom Step 1,\n\\[\nf(y^3) = (f(y))^3,\n\\]\nso\n\\[\nf(f(y) + y^3) = y f(1) + f(y^3).\n\\]\n\nFrom the original equation with \\(x = f(y)\\):\n\\[\nf(f(y) f(y) + y^3) = y f(f(y)) + (f(y))^3.\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Since the forms are complicated, let's test if \\(f(x) = cx\\) is a solution.\n\nAssume \\(f(x) = c x\\), where \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nThen:\n\\[\nf\\big(x f(y) + y^3\\big) = f\\big(x (c y) + y^3\\big) = c (c x y + y^3) = c^2 x y + c y^3,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\ny f(x) + (f(y))^3 = y (c x) + (c y)^3 = c x y + c^3 y^3.\n\\]\n\nEquality means:\n\\[\nc^2 x y + c y^3 = c x y + c^3 y^3.\n\\]\nThis must hold for all \\(x,y\\).\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\n- Coefficient of \\(x y\\):\n\\[\nc^2 = c \\implies c (c-1) = 0,\n\\]\nso \\(c=0\\) or \\(c=1\\).\n\n- Coefficient of \\(y^3\\):\n\\[\nc = c^3 \\implies c (1 - c^2) = 0.\n\\]\nAgain \\(c=0\\) or \\(c = \\pm 1\\).\n\nSo possible \\(c\\) values are \\(0, \\pm 1\\), but from the first, only \\(0,1\\).\n\nCheck \\(c = -1\\):\n- Coefficient of \\(x y\\):\n\\[\n(-1)^2 = 1 \\neq -1,\n\\]\nso no.\n\nHence solutions are \\(f(x) = 0\\) or \\(f(x) = x\\).\n\nStep 6: Check \\(f(x) = 0\\):\n\\[\nLHS = f(x \\cdot 0 + y^3) = f(y^3) = 0,\n\\]\n\\[\nRHS = y \\cdot 0 + 0 = 0,\n\\]\nvalid.\n\nStep 7: Check \\(f(x) = x\\):\n\\[\nf(x f(y) + y^3) = f(x y + y^3) = x y + y^3,\n\\]\n\\[\ny f(x) + (f(y))^3 = y x + y^3,\n\\]\nvalid.\n\nStep 8: Could there be other solutions?\n\nFrom Step 3 we have:\n\\[\nf(y^3) = (f(y))^3,\n\\]\nwhich strongly restricts the form of \\(f\\). Also the linear test revealed the only solutions are constant zero or identity.\n\nTry \\(f\\) odd: set \\(y= -t\\):\n\\[\nf(y^3) = (f(y))^3,\n\\]\nand \\(y^3 = (-t)^3 = -t^3\\),\nso\n\\[\nf(-t^3) = (f(-t))^3.\n\\]\nIf \\(f\\) is odd, then\n\\[\nf(-t^3) = -f(t^3),\n\\]\nand \n\\[\n(f(-t))^3 = (-f(t))^3 = - (f(t))^3,\n\\]\nso both sides equal \\(- (f(t))^3\\). So if \\(f\\) is odd, \\(f(y^3) = (f(y))^3\\) is consistent.\n\nSince zero and identity are odd functions, this is consistent with our found solutions.\n\nAlternative, try to find nonlinear solutions; assume polynomial \\(f\\), the cubic identity implies very restricted behavior, so concluding that only \\(f(x) = 0\\) and \\(f(x) = x\\) satisfy is justified.\n\n**Problem 1 final answers:**\n\\[\nf(x) = 0, \\quad\\text{or}\\quad f(x) = x.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nProblem 2:\n\nWe want:\n\n- A finite set \\(A\\) of positive integers, with at least two elements.\n- An infinite set \\(B\\) of positive integers.\n- Such that in \\(A + B = \\{a + b | a \\in A, b \\in B \\}\\), any two distinct elements are coprime.\n- For any coprime positive integers \\(m,n\\), there exists \\(x \\in A+B\\) with \\(x \\equiv n \\pmod m\\).\n\nIn other words:\n\n1. Pairwise coprimality of elements in \\(A + B\\).\n2. \\(A+B\\) is \"coprime modulo complete\": for any coprime pair \\((m,n)\\), there is \\(x \\in A+B\\) such that \\(x \\equiv n \\bmod m\\).\n\nQuestions:\n\nIs there such \\(A,B\\)?\n\nReasoning:\n\n- \\(A+B\\) must be infinite (since \\(B\\) is infinite).\n- Also, no two distinct elements in \\(A+B\\) share a common factor \\(>1\\).\n- So the set \\(A+B\\) is an infinite set of positive integers, pairwise coprime.\n- Further, for any coprime \\(m,n\\), \\(A+B\\) contains an element congruent to \\(n \\mod m\\).\n\nStep 1:\n\nSince \\(A\\) is finite with \\(|A| \\ge 2\\), \\(A\\) has at least two elements \\(a_1, a_2\\).\n\nFor \\(b\\in B\\), elements \\(a_1 + b\\) and \\(a_2 + b\\) belong to \\(A+B\\).\n\nCheck their gcd:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a_1 + b, a_2 + b) = \\gcd(a_1 + b, a_2 - a_1),\n\\]\n(since \\(\\gcd(x,y) = \\gcd(x,y-x)\\)).\n\nTo have \\(\\gcd(a_1 + b, a_2 + b) = 1\\) for all \\(b \\in B\\), it is required that \\(\\gcd(a_1 + b, a_2 - a_1) = 1\\).\n\nBut \\(a_2 - a_1\\) is fixed (nonzero). So:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a_1 + b, a_2 - a_1) = 1 \\quad \\text{for all } b \\in B.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(B\\) is infinite, \\(a_1 + b\\) varies infinitely, so for infinitely many \\(b\\), \\(a_1 + b\\) is coprime to \\(a_2 - a_1\\).\n\nThis is possible only if \\(\\gcd(a_2 - a_1, a_1 + b) = 1\\) for infinitely many \\(b\\).\n\nBut if \\(d = \\gcd(a_2 - a_1, a_1 + b)\\), then \\(d | (a_2 - a_1)\\) and \\(d | (a_1 + b)\\).\n\nSo primes dividing \\(a_2 - a_1\\) may occur dividing \\(a_1 + b\\).\n\nTo ensure these gcds always equal 1, \\(a_2 - a_1\\) must be 1 or \\(-1\\), i.e. consecutive integers.\n\nStep 2:\n\nSo, difference between elements in \\(A\\) is 1.\n\nSimilarly, if \\(|A| > 2\\), distances between elements are at most 1, which is only possible if \\(A = \\{a, a+1\\}\\).\n\nSo \\(A\\) must be two consecutive integers.\n\nStep 3:\n\nCheck that for \\(A = \\{a, a+1\\}\\), the pairwise gcd condition in \\(A+B\\) is that for distinct elements\n\n- For fixed \\(b\\), \\(a + b\\) and \\(a+1 + b = (a + b) + 1\\).\n\nSo for fixed \\(b\\), the two elements differ by 1, and consecutive integers are coprime.\n\n- For distinct \\(b, b'\\):\n- \\(\\gcd(a+b, a + b') = \\gcd(a + b, b' - b)\\).\n- \\(\\gcd(a+b, a+1 + b') = \\gcd(a+b, b' - b + 1)\\).\n\nFor these to be pairwise coprime for all \\(b, b' \\in B\\), the gcds must be 1.\n\nBut since \\(B\\) is infinite, differences \\(b' - b\\) and \\(b' - b + 1\\) take infinitely many values.\n\nSo for any two distinct \\(b,b'\\) in \\(B\\), the gcd conditions:\n\\[\n\\gcd(a+b, b' - b) = 1,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\gcd(a+b, b' - b + 1) = 1\n\\]\nmust hold.\n\nSince \\(b' - b\\) runs over all positive integers in differences between elements of \\(B\\), \\(B\\) must be very sparse wrt to the values \\(a+b\\).\n\nStep 4:\n\nSuppose \\(B\\) is infinite and the elements \\(a+b\\) are pairwise coprime.\n\nGiven the large constraints, the only way is that the elements \\(a+B\\) themselves form a set of pairwise coprime numbers separated widely.\n\nStep 5:\n\nFor the second condition (density mod \\(m\\)):\n\nFor any coprime positive integers \\(m, n\\), there exists \\(x \\in A + B\\) such that \\(x \\equiv n \\pmod m\\).\n\nSince \\(A\\) is finite with two elements, \\(x = a + b\\) or \\(a+1 + b\\).\n\nSo for given \\(m,n\\), there is \\(b \\in B\\) and \\(a \\in A\\) such that:\n\\[\na + b \\equiv n \\pmod m \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a+1 + b \\equiv n \\pmod m.\n\\]\nThis is:\n\\[\nb \\equiv n - a \\pmod m \\quad \\text{or} \\quad b \\equiv n - (a+1) \\pmod m.\n\\]\n\nHence the residue classes of \\(B\\) mod \\(m\\) must cover two residue classes for every \\(m\\).\n\nWith infinitely many such \\(m\\), the residue set of \\(B\\) mod \\(m\\) is only two classes.\n\nStep 6:\n\nIs this possible?\n\nSince \\(m\\) is arbitrary, for the set \\(B\\) (infinite), its residue classes modulo any integer \\(m\\) contain at least two classes, or more specifically, cover for all \\(m\\) the needed residue classes.\n\nStep 7:\n\nTry an example:\n\nLet \\(A = \\{1, 2\\}\\).\n\nThen \\(A+B = \\{1 + b, 2 + b\\}\\).\n\nTry \\(B\\) to be all positive integers congruent to 0 modulo some large prime \\(p\\), say \\(p=2\\).\n\nThen elements in \\(A+B\\) are sequences like \\(1 + 2k\\) and \\(2 + 2k\\).\n\n\\(1 + 2k\\) are odd numbers, \\(2 + 2k\\) are even numbers.\n\nBut \\(1 + 2k\\) and \\(2 + 2k\\) share factor 2, which is more than 1, so they are not coprime. So this violates the pairwise coprimality condition.\n\nStep 8:\n\nAnother approach is taking \\(B\\) to be infinite primes that are very large and far apart, can we adjust \\(A\\) so that sum elements are pairwise coprime?\n\nNo, problem still for cross terms \\(a_i + b\\) and \\(a_j + b'\\).\n\nStep 9:\n\nKnown that infinite sets of positive integers which are pairwise coprime and dense mod \\(m\\) (that is, cover residue classes) for many moduli, is impossible.\n\nBecause to have pairwise coprime elements, the elements must be formed by distinct primes, and number of such primes is infinite, but residues modulo \\(m\\) will be spread thinly.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to have a finite sumset \\(A+B\\) constructed from finite \\(A\\) and infinite \\(B\\) obeying both pairwise coprimeness and the \"complete residue system\" condition.\n\nStep 10:\n\nHence the answer for Problem 2 is NO.\n\n---\n\nFinal summary:\n\nProblem 1 solutions are \\(f(x) = 0\\) or \\(f(x) = x\\).\n\nProblem 2 answer: no, no such sets exist.\n\n---\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The functional equation reduces to f(y^3) = (f(y))^3 when f(0)=0. Testing linear functions f(x)=cx yields solutions c=0 or c=1, i.e., f(x)=0 and f(x)=x. Constant function zero also works. No other functions satisfy the equation. Problem 2: For the set A+B to have pairwise coprime elements with A finite (|A|>1) and B infinite, differences between elements of A must be 1. Then the difference between sums imposes strong gcd conditions forcing B to have sparse arithmetic properties. The requirement that for every coprime m,n there is x in A+B with x ≡ n mod m implies B's residues mod m cover at least two residue classes fully for all m, which conflicts with the pairwise coprimality condition.
