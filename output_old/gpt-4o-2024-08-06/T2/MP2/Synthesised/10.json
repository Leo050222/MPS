  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. We are given:\n\n\\[\na + \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{216}},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, and we can denest the nested radical on the right side to match the form on the left side.\n\n2. Let's try to express \\(\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{216}}\\) in the form \\(a + \\sqrt{b}\\).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\n(a + \\sqrt{b})^2 = 15 + \\sqrt{216}.\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[\na^2 + 2a \\sqrt{b} + b = 15 + \\sqrt{216}.\n\\]\n\nEquate rational and irrational parts:\n\n- Rational part: \\(a^2 + b = 15\\),\n- Irrational part: \\(2a \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{216}\\).\n\n3. From the irrational parts:\n\n\\[\n2 a \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{216}.\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\n(2 a \\sqrt{b})^2 = (\\sqrt{216})^2 \\implies 4 a^2 b = 216.\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n4 a^2 b = 216 \\implies a^2 b = 54.\n\\]\n\n4. From the rational part:\n\n\\[\na^2 + b = 15 \\implies b = 15 - a^2.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute into \\(a^2 b = 54\\):\n\n\\[\na^2 (15 - a^2) = 54.\n\\]\n\nSet \\(x = a^2\\) for simplicity:\n\n\\[\nx (15 - x) = 54,\n\\]\n\\[\n15x - x^2 = 54,\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 -15 x +54 = 0.\n\\]\n\n5. Solve the quadratic:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 15x + 54 = 0.\n\\]\n\nDiscriminant:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-15)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 54 = 225 - 216 = 9.\n\\]\n\nRoots:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{15 \\pm 3}{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nx_1 = \\frac{15 + 3}{2} = 9, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{15 - 3}{2} = 6.\n\\]\n\n6. Try \\(x = a^2 = 9\\):\n\n\\[\nb = 15 - 9 = 6.\n\\]\n\nCheck \\(a^2 b = 9 \\times 6 = 54\\) (holds).\n\n7. So \\(a = \\pm 3\\). Try \\(a=3\\):\n\n\\[\na + \\sqrt{b} = 3 + \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nCheck if this equals \\(\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{216}}\\):\n\nFirst, compute \\((3 + \\sqrt{6})^2\\):\n\n\\[\n3^2 + 2 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{6} + (\\sqrt{6})^2 = 9 + 6 \\sqrt{6} + 6 = 15 + 6 \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nNow, \\(\\sqrt{216} = \\sqrt{36 \\times 6} = 6 \\sqrt{6}\\).\n\nTherefore, the right side is also \\(15 + 6 \\sqrt{6}\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{216}} = 3 + \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nHence,\n\n\\[\na = 3, \\quad b = 6.\n\\]\n\n8. We now need to find\n\n\\[\nk = a + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\\]\n\n9. Mark has a cursed \\(k\\)-sided die with \\(k=6\\), that never rolls the same number twice in a row, and all allowed outcomes are equally likely.\n\nWe are to compute the expected number of rolls to roll every number at least once.\n\n---\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem of expected time to cover all outcomes in a Markov chain with \"no repeat\" condition.\n\n---\n\nWe have:\n\n- A die with 6 sides (values 1 to 6).\n- On each roll, the outcome cannot be equal to the previous roll.\n- When rolling the die after some history, the allowed numbers at any step are all except the previous roll.\n\n- The probability of any allowed number is equal, so probability 1/(6-1) = 1/5 for each allowed number each roll (because can't roll the previous number).\n\n---\n\nStep 2: We want the expected time (number of rolls) to observe all 6 numbers at least once.\n\nThis is a variation of the \"coupon collector\" problem with dependence between consecutive draws.\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Define states:\n\n- The number of unique numbers collected so far: \\(i\\) numbers seen, \\(i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 6\\}\\).\n- The last number rolled (to determine allowed next rolls).\n- The state space is large, but we want expected time to collect all 6.\n\n---\n\nStep 4: Because it's complicated to track last number, notice symmetry and use linearity of expectation and Markov property.\n\n---\n\nStep 5: Let's define:\n\n\\(E_i\\) = expected number of rolls to get a new number given that \\(i\\) unique numbers collected, and the last roll was something.\n\nWe need to find the expected number of rolls to go from \\(i\\) unique numbers collected to \\(i+1\\).\n\n---\n\nStep 6: Key observations:\n\n- At step \\(i\\), we've collected \\(i\\) unique numbers, and \\(6 - i\\) remain to be collected.\n\n- The probability that next roll is a new number (one of the \\(6 - i\\) numbers) depends on the last roll.\n\n- But last roll is among the collected numbers, so:\n\nAllowed next rolls = all 6 numbers except previous roll (since repetition forbidden).\n\n---\n\nStep 7: Probability of getting a new number in one roll at stage \\(i\\):\n\nWe have 6 numbers total, previous roll excluded => 5 choices equally likely.\n\nOf these 5 possible next numbers, how many are new numbers?\n\n- Among these 5 numbers, the number of new numbers is the count of new numbers that are not equal to the previous roll.\n\n- Since the previous roll is among the \\(i\\) collected numbers, it is not any new number.\n\n- The new numbers are among the 6 total numbers, excluding the \\(i\\) collected numbers.\n\n- The previous roll is one of the collected numbers (since we've rolled it), so previous roll is among the \\(i\\) collected numbers.\n\n- So, the \\(5\\) possible next rolls are all numbers except previous roll.\n\n- Among these 5 next possible rolls, the number of new numbers possible is:\n\nNumber of new numbers (not rolled before) = \\(6 - i\\).\n\nBut new numbers in possible next numbers cannot be the previous roll, which is already excluded.\n\nAre any new numbers excluded from the possible next rolls?\n\nNo, previous roll is from collected numbers, so new numbers are among the 5 possible next rolls.\n\nTherefore, the number of new numbers among possible next rolls is \\(6 - i\\).\n\n---\n\nStep 8: So the probability of getting a new number in one roll at state \\(i\\) is:\n\n\\[\np_i = \\frac{6 - i}{5}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the expected time to get a new number at state \\(i\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{p_i} = \\frac{5}{6 - i}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nStep 9: The total expected number of rolls to collect all numbers starting from 1 unique number (we must have at least 1 number to start):\n\n- The first roll happens, and we get the first number (starting with 1).\n\n- Then expected time to get from having 1 unique number to all 6 is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{5}{6 - i} = 5 \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\frac{1}{6 - i} = 5 \\sum_{j=1}^5 \\frac{1}{j},\n\\]\n\nletting \\(j = 6 - i\\).\n\n- The harmonic number \\(H_5 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\)\n\nCalculate \\(H_5\\):\n\n\\[\nH_5 = 1 + 0.5 + 0.3333... + 0.25 + 0.2 = 2.2833...,\n\\]\n\nwhich exactly equals:\n\n\\[\nH_5 = \\frac{137}{60} = 2.2833... \\text{ (known exact fraction)}.\n\\]\n\n(Confirmed: \\(1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{137}{60}\\)).\n\n---\n\nStep 10: Thus,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected rolls} = 1 + 5 \\cdot H_5 = 1 + 5 \\times \\frac{137}{60} = 1 + \\frac{685}{60} = \\frac{60}{60} + \\frac{685}{60} = \\frac{745}{60} = \\frac{149}{12}.\n\\]\n\nWe add 1 because the first roll to get the first unique number is 1 roll.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\[\nk = 6,\n\\]\n\nand expected number of rolls to see all numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{149}{12}}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Denested radical form: \\(3 + \\sqrt{6}\\).\n- \\(k = a + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6\\).\n- Expected rolls needed to see all numbers on cursed 6-sided die:\n\n\\[\n1 + 5 \\times H_5 = \\frac{149}{12}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nNow, per instructions, output in JSON format with only the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"answer\": \"149/12\"\n}\n```",
