The other five numbers are equally likely each time.\n\nWe want to find the expected number of rolls to have seen all numbers 1 through 6 at least once.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nBecause the die can't repeat the previous roll, on each roll after the first, there are only 5 possible outcomes (each different from the last roll), with equal probability \\(1/5\\).\n\nWe want the expected number of rolls \\(E\\) until all 6 distinct numbers appear.\n\nThis is a variation of the coupon collector problem with a twist:\n\n- On the first roll, any number (1 through 6) comes up, so the first coupon is collected in 1 roll.\n\n- On each subsequent roll, the number can be any of the 5 numbers different from the previous roll.\n\nWe can model this as a Markov chain or a variant of coupon collector with adjusted probabilities.\n\nStep 1: Define states as the number of distinct numbers seen so far (from 1 to 6).\n\nStep 2: Let \\(E_k\\) = expected additional rolls to collect all 6 numbers given that we have already seen \\(k\\) distinct numbers. We want \\(E_1\\), starting after first roll.\n\nWe want to find \\(E_1\\).\n\nStep 3: Probability that the next roll yields a new number:\n\nThe last number rolled is one of the \\(k\\) known numbers (since it was the last roll), so the next roll can be any of the other 5 numbers, equally likely.\n\nOut of these 5 possible next numbers, how many are new?\n\n- Total distinct numbers are 6.\n\n- Already seen \\(k\\).\n\n- The previous roll number (which is also the last seen number) is among the \\(k\\) known numbers.\n\n- The \\(k\\) known numbers includes the previous roll number, so among the 5 possible next numbers (all different from the previous), the number of new numbers is \\(6 - k\\).\n\nHow?\n\n- We exclude the previous number.\n\n- From the 6 numbers, \\(k\\) are known, so the number of known numbers other than the previous roll is \\(k-1\\).\n\n- The set of possible next rolls is the 5 numbers excluding previous roll.\n\n- Among these 5 numbers, the number of new numbers is:\n\\[\n5 - (k-1) = 6 - k\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the probability of getting a new number on the next roll is:\n\\[\np_k = \\frac{6 - k}{5}\n\\]\n\nStep 5: The expected number of rolls to get a new number given we have \\(k\\) distinct numbers is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{p_k} = \\frac{5}{6 - k}\n\\]\n\nStep 6: To get from \\(k\\) distinct numbers to \\(k+1\\) distinct numbers, expected rolls needed is \\(\\frac{5}{6-k}\\).\n\nStep 7: Sum over \\(k\\) from 1 to 5 to get expected rolls after first roll:\n\n\\[\nE_1 = \\sum_{k=1}^5 \\frac{5}{6 - k} = 5 \\sum_{k=1}^5 \\frac{1}{6 - k}\n\\]\n\nRewrite sum:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^5 \\frac{1}{6-k} = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{1}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[\nE_1 = 5 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5}\\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculate the sum inside parentheses:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\text{Harmonic number } H_5 = \\approx 2.2833333333\n\\]\n\nBut we can keep it in exact fraction form:\n\\[\n= 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\nFind common denominator 60:\n\\[\n= \\frac{60}{60} + \\frac{30}{60} + \\frac{20}{60} + \\frac{15}{60} + \\frac{12}{60} = \\frac{60+30+20+15+12}{60} = \\frac{137}{60}\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\\[\nE_1 = 5 \\times \\frac{137}{60} = \\frac{685}{60} = \\frac{137}{12}\n\\]\n\nStep 8: The total expected number of rolls \\(E\\) is:\n\\[\nE = 1 + E_1 = 1 + \\frac{137}{12} = \\frac{12}{12} + \\frac{137}{12} = \\frac{149}{12}\n\\]\n\nFinal check: \\(\\frac{149}{12} \\approx 12.4167\\).\n\n---\n\n**Final answers:**\n\nProblem 1 answer: \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nProblem 2 answer: \\(\\frac{149}{12}\\)\n\n---\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We set a+sqrt(b)=sqrt(15 + sqrt(216)) and simplify sqrt(216) to 6*sqrt(6). Assuming a+sqrt(b) form, we square both sides, then equate rational and irrational parts to get a system: a^2 + b =15 and 2a*sqrt(b) = 6*sqrt(6). From the irrational part, a*sqrt(b) = 3*sqrt(6), which squared gives a^2*b=54. Substituting b=15-a^2 leads to a quartic in a^2, solved as a^2=9 or 6, with 9 chosen for integer a=3. This gives b=6, and a/b=1/2. Problem 2: The cursed die never repeats the previous number, so each roll after the first can be any of the other 5 numbers with equal probability 1/5. Expected rolls needed to get from k distinct numbers to k+1 distinct numbers is the reciprocal of probability of new number: 5/(6-k). Summing these for k=1 to 5 and adding the first roll yields total expectation E=1 + 5*(1/5 + 1/4 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 1) = 1 + 5*(137/60) = 149/12.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"149/12\"\n}",
