Because these two events concern different subsets, we consider the union/intersection properly.\n\nBetter to write:\n\n\\[\np_N = 1 - P(\\text{product not divisible by } 2 \\text{ or } 5)\n\\]\n\nBut for the product not to be divisible by 10, the product is not divisible by 2 or product not divisible by 5.\n\nThe complement of \"product divisible by 10\" is:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{p_N} = P(\\text{product not divisible by } 10) = P(\\text{product not divisible by } 2 \\text{ or product not divisible by } 5).\n\\]\n\nBecause if product has no factor 2 or no factor 5, product not divisible by 10. So:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{p_N} = P(\\text{not divisible by } 2 \\text{ or not divisible by } 5).\n\\]\n\nBy the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{p_N} = P(\\text{product not divisible by } 2) + P(\\text{product not divisible by } 5) - P(\\text{product not divisible by } 2 \\text{ and not divisible by } 5)\n\\]\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Calculating these probabilities\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\( E = \\) event \"product divisible by 2\"\n- \\( F = \\) event \"product divisible by 5\"\n\nWe want:\n\n\\[\np_N = P(E \\cap F) = 1 - P(\\overline{E} \\cup \\overline{F}) = 1 - \\left( P(\\overline{E}) + P(\\overline{F}) - P(\\overline{E} \\cap \\overline{F}) \\right).\n\\]\n\nNote that:\n\n- \\( \\overline{E} \\): \"product not divisible by 2\" → both numbers are odd.\n- \\( \\overline{F} \\): \"product not divisible by 5\" → both numbers are not divisible by 5.\n\nSo:\n\n- \\( P(\\overline{E}) = P(\\text{both are odd}) = \\left(\\frac{\\# \\text{odd in } [1,N]}{N}\\right)^2 \\).\n- \\( P(\\overline{F}) = P(\\text{both not divisible by 5}) = \\left(\\frac{\\# \\text{not divisible by } 5 \\text{ in } [1,N]}{N}\\right)^2 \\).\n- \\( P(\\overline{E} \\cap \\overline{F}) = P(\\text{both odd and both not divisible by 5}) = \\left(\\frac{\\# \\text{odd not divisible by } 5}{N}\\right)^2 \\).\n\nStep 4: Find counts.\n\nDenote:\n\n- \\( O = \\) number of odd integers in [1..N].\n- \\( M = \\) number of multiples of 5 in [1..N].\n- \\( O_5 = \\) number of integers that are odd and multiples of 5 in [1..N].\n\nWe have:\n\n- Number of odds \\( O = \\lceil \\frac{N}{2} \\rceil \\) (count of odd numbers from 1 to N).\n- Number of multiples of 5: \\( M = \\lfloor \\frac{N}{5} \\rfloor \\).\n- Number of odd multiples of 5: these are multiples of 5 that are odd.\n\nMultiples of 5 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25... Odd multiples of 5 are every other multiple of 5 starting from 5: 5, 15, 25, 35, ...\n\nNumber of odd multiples of 5 in [1..N] is:\n\n\\[\nO_5 = \\# \\{ k: 5k \\leq N, k \\text{ odd} \\}\n\\]\n\nNumber of multiples of 5 is \\( M \\).\n\nThe odd multiples of 5 is roughly half of \\( M \\), rounding depends on parity of M.\n\nMore precisely:\n\n1.
