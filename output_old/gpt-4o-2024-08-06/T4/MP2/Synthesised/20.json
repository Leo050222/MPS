  "math_problem": "Find all positive integers $n, k_1, \\dots, k_n$ such that $k_1 + \\cdots + k_n = 5n-4$ and \\[ \\frac{1}{k_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{k_n} = 1. \\] Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ and corresponding $k_1, \\dots, k_n$ satisfying the sum and reciprocal sum conditions, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the part size in the solution with the smallest possible $n$, derived from the structural consideration of minimal number of terms in the representation. Alice and Bob play a game on a board consisting of one row of $k + 2021$ consecutive squares. They take turns placing tiles that cover two adjacent squares, with Alice going first. By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule. Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends; Bob's goal is to minimize it. What is the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure at the end of the game, no matter how Bob plays?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"First, we analyze the first part of the problem to find the smallest possible n and the corresponding part size k.\\n\\nGiven:\\n- Positive integers n, k1, ..., kn\\n- k1 + k2 + ... + kn = 5n - 4\\n- 1/k1 + 1/k2 + ... + 1/kn = 1\\n\\nWe want to find the smallest n such that the above holds and derive k (the part size in the solution) for that minimal n.\\n\\nStep 1: Understand the problem\\nWe have n positive integers whose sum is 5n - 4, and their reciprocal sum is 1.\\nWe want to find the minimal n for which such a solution exists and then identify the part size k in that solution.\\n\\nStep 2: Try to find a general pattern or try small values of n\\nTry n=1:\\n- k1 = 5(1) - 4 = 1\\n- Check 1/1 = 1 -> sum of reciprocals is 1, sum is 1, matches.\\nSo for n=1, k1=1 fits exactly.\\n\\nn=1 is minimal. So the smallest possible n is 1.\\nWe have k=1.\\n\\nBut given the problem's wording: \\\"Instead of finding all ... simply find k where k is the part size in the solution with smallest possible n, derived from the structural consideration of minimal number of terms.\\\" It matches to k=1.\\n\\nSecond part of problem:\\n\\nAlice and Bob play a game on a board with k + 2021 consecutive squares.\\n\\nFrom first part, k=1 (smallest part size for the minimal n satisfying the conditions).\\nSo the board length is 1 + 2021 = 2022 squares.\\n\\nGame rules:\\n- Tiles cover two adjacent squares\\n- Tiles cannot overlap\\n- Alice wants to maximize uncovered squares\\n- Bob wants to minimize uncovered squares\\n- Alice starts\\n- Game ends when no tile can be played\\n\\nGoal: What is the greatest number of uncovered squares Alice can ensure at the end, regardless of Bob's moves?\\n\\nStep 3: Analyze the tile placement game\\n- Board length: 2022 squares (an even number)\\n- Tiles cover 2 squares each\\n\\nSince 2022 is even, the maximum number of tiles that can be placed is 1011 (since each tile covers two squares).\\n\\nIf both players play optimally:\\n- Bob tries to minimize remaining uncovered squares; he wants to cover as many squares as possible.\\n- Alice wants to maximize uncovered squares at the end.\\n\\nBut since the board length is even and all tiles are 2 squares, it is possible to cover all squares with no leftover squares if players cooperate.\\n\\nHowever, Alice wants to maximize uncovered squares; since she starts, she can try to split board into unreachable segments.\\n\\nBut Bob plays optimally to minimize uncovered squares.\\n\\nStep 4: Important fact about players placing dominoes on a line\\n- Because the board length is even, if both players play optimally and both place tiles covering 2 adjacent squares, eventually the entire board can be covered with tiles.\\n- The number of tiles is 1011, and 1011 moves total (half by Alice, half by Bob). \\n\\nNumber of moves each:\\n- Total tiles placed: 1011\\n- Turns alternate, Alice starts, so Alice makes 506 moves\\n- Bob makes 505 moves\\n\\nCounting total tiles placed is 1011.\\n\\nBecause the total length is even, the best achievable uncovered squares are zero if Bob can always avoid Alice's attempts to split the board.\\n\\nBut the question is: what is the greatest number of uncovered squares Alice can ensure?\\n\\nSince Alice moves first and tries to maximize uncovered squares, she tries to create an odd-length gap where a single square remains uncovered.\\n\\nStep 5: Parity argument\\nThe number of squares is even. Tiles cover 2 squares. So the entire board can be perfectly tiled if moves are played without blockages.\\n\\nAlice tries to create an odd-length segment. Because the entire board starts as one segment, when Alice places a domino, she removes 2 squares, breaking the board into at most two new segments. If she plays cleverly, she can create an odd-length segment which Bob cannot fully tile, leaving at least one square uncovered.\\n\\nSince Bob tries to minimize uncovered squares, he will try to tile as much as possible.\\n\\nStep 6: Known result in such games is that the first player can guarantee leaving one or two uncovered squares if the board length is even.\\n\\nBut we should check small cases for clarity.\\n\\nSmall cases:\\n- Board length 2 (k=1 + 2021): for k=1, board length = 2022\\n- For length 2, moves:\\n   Only 1 tile can be placed, completely covering the board.\\n\\nBy analogy, on a large even board, Alice cannot prevent Bob from covering all the board if Bob plays optimally.\\n\\nHence uncovered squares = 0.\\n\\nStep 7: Re-examining the problem statement\\n\\\"What is the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure at the end of the game, no matter how Bob plays?\\\"\\n\\nIf the board length is even, and tiles cover 2 squares, the board can be perfectly covered.\\n\\nTherefore, Alice cannot ensure any uncovered squares remain.\\n\\nThus the greatest number of uncovered squares Alice can ensure is 0.\\n\\nStep 8: Verify relevance of k\\nk was found to be 1 from the first part of the problem.\\nBoard length: k + 2021 = 1 + 2021 = 2022\\nAnswer is 0 uncovered squares.\\n\\nFinal Answer: 0\",\n  \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
