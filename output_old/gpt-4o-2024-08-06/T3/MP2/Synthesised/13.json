  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be square with 4 digits, such that all its digits are less than 6. If we add 1 to each digit the resulting number is another square. Find $n$ Instead of identifying the 4-digit perfect square satisfying the digit increment condition, simply find $m = a - 42$, where $a$ is the integer whose square is that number. P is a polynomial. When P is divided by $x-1$, the remainder is -4 . When P is divided by $x-2$, the remainder is -1 . When $P$ is divided by $x-3$, the remainder is 4 . Determine the remainder when $P$ is divided by $x^{m}-6 x^{2}+11 x-6$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Understand the problem\\nWe have a 4-digit perfect square number n = a^2, where all digits of n are less than 6. When we add 1 to each digit of n, the resulting number is also a perfect square.\\n\\nWe need to find m = a - 42.\\n\\nAlso, we have a polynomial P. The remainders when divided by x-1, x-2, and x-3 are given:\\nP(1) = -4\\nP(2) = -1\\nP(3) = 4\\n\\nWe need to find the remainder when P is divided by x^m - 6x^2 + 11x - 6.\\n\\nStep 2: Analyze the polynomial divisor\\nNote that x^m - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 looks like an unusual polynomial, but if m=3, then it is x^3 -6x^2 + 11x - 6.\\nThis polynomial factors as follows:\\n(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6\\n\\nSo if m=3, then the divisor polynomial is (x-1)(x-2)(x-3), and the remainder when dividing P by this cubic polynomial must be a polynomial of degree at most 2.\\n\\nBecause P(1)=-4, P(2)=-1, P(3)=4, the remainder when dividing by (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) is exactly the polynomial that takes those values at x=1,2,3.\\n\\nStep 3: Find 'a' and then 'm = a - 42'\\nFirst, find a four-digit perfect square n = a^2 with digits less than 6, and when adding 1 to each digit, the resulting number is also a perfect square.\\n\\nDigits of n are from {0,1,2,3,4,5}. Adding 1 to each digit results in digits {1,2,3,4,5,6}, possible digits.\\n\\nTry to find such n.\\n\\nLet's check squares of integers whose squares are 4-digit numbers with digits less than 6.\\n\\nRange for a: Since n is 4-digit, 32^2=1024 (4-digit minimum) and 99^2=9801 (max 4-digit).\\n\\nCheck squares between 32^2 and 76^2 (since digits less than 6 restrict high numbers). \\n\\nLet's check candidates:\\n\\n- 55^2 = 3025 (digits 3,0,2,5 all <6)\\n- Add 1 to each digit: 4136;\\n- Check if 4136 is a perfect square?\\n\\nsqrt(4136) ≈ 64.3 (no, since 64^2=4096, 65^2=4225)\\n\\nContinue:\\n\\nTry 54^2=2916 (digits <6 ok)\\nAdding 1: 3 10 2 7 (But digit 10 impossible)\\n\\nSo skip because digits after addition must also be single digit.\\n\\nSo digits must be strictly less than 5 to have after adding 1 still digits less than 10.\\nSo digits less than 6 before addition is acceptable.\\n\\nTry 45^2=2025 (digits <6)\\nAdd 1: 3136\\nCheck if 3136 is a perfect square:\\nsqrt(3136) = 56\\nBecause 56^2=3136\\n\\nYes, 3136 is a perfect square!\\n\\nSo n=2025 (45^2), adding 1 to each digit gives 3136 (56^2).\\n\\nSo a=45\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate m=a - 42 = 45 - 42 = 3\\n\\nStep 5: Now find remainder when P is divided by x^m - 6x^2 + 11x - 6\\nSince m=3, polynomial divisor is x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\\n\\nWe want the remainder R(x) when P(x) is divided by (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\\nR(x) is a quadratic polynomial (degree less than 3).\\n\\nGiven:\\nP(1) = -4\\nP(2) = -1\\nP(3) = 4\\n\\nSince remainder must satisfy R(x) = P(x) at x=1,2,3,\\nR(1) = -4, R(2) = -1, R(3) = 4\\n\\nLet R(x) = A x^2 + B x + C\\n\\nForm the system:\\nA(1)^2 + B(1) + C = -4 -> A + B + C = -4\\nA(2)^2 + B(2) + C = -1 -> 4A + 2B + C = -1\\nA(3)^2 + B(3) + C = 4 -> 9A + 3B + C = 4\\n\\nSubtract eq1 from eq2:\\n(4A - A) + (2B - B) + (C - C) = (-1) - (-4)\\n3A + B = 3  ...(i)\\n\\nSubtract eq2 from eq3:\\n(9A - 4A) + (3B - 2B) + (C - C) = 4 - (-1)\\n5A + B = 5  ...(ii)\\n\\nSubtract (i) from (ii):\\n(5A - 3A) + (B - B) = 5 - 3\\n2A = 2 => A =1\\n\\nFrom (i):\\n3(1) + B =3 => 3 + B =3 => B=0\\n\\nFrom eq1:\\n1 + 0 + C = -4 => C = -5\\n\\nSo R(x) = x^2 - 5\\n\\nStep 6: Final answer is polynomial remainder: x^2 - 5\\n\\nReturn in the format asked:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"answer\\\": \\\"x^2-5\\\"\\n}\\n\\n\",\n    \"answer\": \"x^2-5\"\n}",
