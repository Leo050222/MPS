  "reasoning_content": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Given: \n   \\[\n   Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   P(Q(x)) = x^6 + 6x^5 + 18x^4 + 32x^3 + 35x^2 + 22x + 8.\n   \\]\n\n2. First, find \\(P(x)\\).\n\n   Since \\(Q(x)\\) is a quadratic polynomial, and \\(P(Q(x))\\) is given as degree 6, we expect \\(P(x)\\) to be a cubic polynomial, because composing a cubic polynomial \\(P\\) with a quadratic polynomial \\(Q\\) gives degree \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n\n   Let:\n   \\[\n   P(x) = a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d.\n   \\]\n\n3. Then:\n   \\[\n   P(Q(x)) = a(Q(x))^3 + b(Q(x))^2 + c Q(x) + d.\n   \\]\n\n4. Compute \\(Q(x)\\), \\(Q(x)^2\\), and \\(Q(x)^3\\):\n\n   \\[\n   Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3.\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q(x)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 3)^2 = x^4 + 4x^3 + 10x^2 + 12x + 9.\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Q(x)^3 = (Q(x)^2)(Q(x)) = (x^4 + 4x^3 + 10x^2 + 12x + 9)(x^2 + 2x +3).\n   \\]\n\n   Multiply out \\(Q(x)^3\\):\n   \\[\n   = x^4 \\cdot x^2 + x^4 \\cdot 2x + x^4 \\cdot 3 + 4x^3 \\cdot x^2 + 4x^3 \\cdot 2x + 4x^3 \\cdot 3 + 10x^2 \\cdot x^2 + 10x^2 \\cdot 2x + 10x^2 \\cdot 3 + 12x \\cdot x^2 + 12x \\cdot 2x + 12x \\cdot 3 + 9 \\cdot x^2 + 9 \\cdot 2x + 9 \\cdot 3.\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate each term:\n   - \\(x^4 \\cdot x^2 = x^6\\)\n   - \\(x^4 \\cdot 2x = 2x^5\\)\n   - \\(x^4 \\cdot 3 = 3x^4\\)\n   - \\(4x^3 \\cdot x^2 = 4x^5\\)\n   - \\(4x^3 \\cdot 2x = 8x^4\\)\n   - \\(4x^3 \\cdot 3 = 12x^3\\)\n   - \\(10x^2 \\cdot x^2 = 10x^4\\)\n   - \\(10x^2 \\cdot 2x = 20x^3\\)\n   - \\(10x^2 \\cdot 3 = 30x^2\\)\n   - \\(12x \\cdot x^2 = 12x^3\\)\n   - \\(12x \\cdot 2x = 24x^2\\)\n   - \\(12x \\cdot 3 = 36x\\)\n   - \\(9 \\cdot x^2 = 9x^2\\)\n   - \\(9 \\cdot 2x = 18x\\)\n   - \\(9 \\cdot 3 = 27\\)\n\n   Now sum by powers of \\(x\\):\n   - \\(x^6\\): \\(1\\)\n   - \\(x^5\\): \\(2 + 4 = 6\\)\n   - \\(x^4\\): \\(3 + 8 + 10 = 21\\)\n   - \\(x^3\\): \\(12 + 20 + 12 = 44\\)\n   - \\(x^2\\): \\(30 + 24 + 9 = 63\\)\n   - \\(x^1\\): \\(36 + 18 = 54\\)\n   - Constant: 27\n\n   So:\n   \\[\n   Q(x)^3 = x^6 + 6x^5 + 21x^4 + 44x^3 + 63x^2 + 54x + 27.\n   \\]\n\n5. Next, write \\(P(Q(x))\\) in terms of \\(a,b,c,d\\):\n   \\[\n   P(Q(x)) = a Q(x)^3 + b Q(x)^2 + c Q(x) + d.\n   \\]\n   Substitute from above:\n   \\[\n   P(Q(x)) = a(x^6 + 6x^5 + 21x^4 + 44x^3 + 63x^2 + 54x + 27) + b(x^4 +4 x^3 + 10 x^2 + 12 x + 9) + c(x^2 + 2 x + 3) + d.\n   \\]\n\n6. Group coefficients by powers of \\(x\\):\n\n   - \\(x^6\\): \\(a\\).\n   - \\(x^5\\): \\(6a\\).\n   - \\(x^4\\): \\(21a + b\\).\n   - \\(x^3\\): \\(44a + 4b\\).\n   - \\(x^2\\): \\(63a + 10b + c\\).\n   - \\(x^1\\): \\(54a + 12b + 2c\\).\n   - Constant: \\(27a + 9b + 3c + d\\).\n\n7. Match with \\(P(Q(x)) = x^6 + 6x^5 + 18x^4 + 32x^3 + 35x^2 + 22x + 8\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{cases}\n   a = 1 \\\\\n   6a = 6 \\implies 6 \\cdot 1 = 6 \\quad \\text{checks out.} \\\\\n   21a + b = 18 \\implies 21 + b = 18 \\implies b = -3 \\\\\n   44a + 4b = 32 \\implies 44 + 4(-3) = 44 -12 = 32 \\quad \\text{checks out.} \\\\\n   63a + 10b + c = 35 \\implies 63 + 10(-3) + c = 35 \\implies 63 -30 + c = 35 \\implies c = 35 - 33 = 2 \\\\\n   54a + 12b + 2c = 22 \\implies 54 + 12(-3) + 2(2) = 54 -36 + 4 = 22 \\quad \\text{checks out.} \\\\\n   27a + 9b + 3c + d = 8 \\implies 27 + 9(-3) + 3(2) + d = 8 \\implies 27 - 27 + 6 + d = 8 \\implies 6 + d = 8 \\implies d = 2\n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n\n8. So, the polynomial \\(P(x)\\) is:\n   \\[\n   P(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 2.\n   \\]\n\n9. The problem asks instead of computing \\(P(2)\\), find:\n   \\[\n   k = Q(r) - 1,\n   \\]\n   where \\(r\\) is the unique real root of the derivative of \\(Q\\).\n\n10. Find the derivative of \\(Q\\):\n    \\[\n    Q'(x) = 2x + 2.\n    \\]\n    Set \\(Q'(x) = 0\\):\n    \\[\n    2x + 2 = 0 \\implies x = -1.\n    \\]\n    Thus \\(r = -1\\).\n\n11. Compute \\(Q(r)\\):\n    \\[\n    Q(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2 \\cdot (-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2.\n    \\]\n    Therefore,\n    \\[\n    k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\n    \\]\n\n12. The final part: \"Does there exist an irrational number \\(\\alpha > k\\) such that \\(\\left\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\right\\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}\\) for all integers \\(n \\geq k\\)?\"\n\n    - Note \\(k=1\\).\n    - We want \\(\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\mod 2017\\) for all \\(n \\geq 1\\).\n\n13. To have \\(\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}\\), the floor of \\(\\alpha^n\\) must be divisible by 2017 for all \\(n \\geq 1\\).\n\n14. Consider if \\(\\alpha\\) is irrational and bigger than 1. If \\(\\alpha\\) is an integer multiple of 2017, say \\(\\alpha = 2017m\\), then all powers are multiples of 2017. But \\(\\alpha\\) must be irrational, so \\(\\alpha\\) cannot be an integer.\n\n15. However, if \\(\\alpha\\) is irrational but very close to an integer multiple of 2017, the fractional parts may prevent \\(\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\rfloor\\) from always being divisible by 2017.\n\n16. The condition that for all \\(n \\geq 1\\), \\(\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}\\) is quite strong.\n\n    One candidate is \\(\\alpha = 2017^{1/m}\\) where \\(m\\) is an integer, so that \\(\\alpha^m = 2017\\). But \\(2017^{1/m}\\) is rational only when \\(m=1\\), so for higher \\(m\\) it's irrational.\n\n    For \\(n\\) multiples of \\(m\\), \\(\\alpha^n = ( \\alpha^m )^{n/m} = 2017^{n/m}\\).\n\n    But unless \\(n\\) is a multiple of \\(m\\), \\( \\alpha^n \\) will not be an integer multiple of 2017 necessarily.\n\n17. Given all \\(n \\geq 1\\), this is impossible for irrational \\(\\alpha > 1\\), because the residues modulo 2017 do not stabilize to zero for all powers.\n\n18. Therefore, **no such irrational \\(\\alpha > 1\\) (i.e., \\(\\alpha > k\\)) exists** satisfying the condition:\n    \\[\n    \\forall n \\geq k, \\quad \\lfloor\\alpha^n\\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}.\n    \\]\n\n---\n\nFinal answers:\n\n\\[\nk = 1,\n\\]\n\nand\n\nThere *does not exist* such an irrational number \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n---\n\nJSON format as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Found P(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 2 by matching coefficients. The unique real root of Q'(x) = 2x + 2 is r = -1. Then k = Q(r) -1 = 2 -1 =1. The question about existence of irrational alpha > k such that floor(alpha^n) ≡ 0 mod 2017 for all n≥k is negative because such a strong divisibility condition for all powers cannot hold for irrational alpha greater than 1. Hence, no such alpha exists.\",\n  \"answer\": \"1 no\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: The answer field contains \"1 no\" per problem directions, reporting exact value of k then answer about existence. If problem requires more specific format for existence answer, it should be \"no\". Since no special instruction, I will put \"1 no\".\n\nBut per instruction, answer field is to contain only the answer value (numerical or text). The problem states: \"Put ONLY the answer value in the quotes (no explanations)\". Since there are two parts, the first numerical value k, and the answer to existence. Probably better to put two separate keys.\n\nBut per instructions, answer field is only one string.\n\nWait, problem says: \"Instead of computing P(2), simply find k=Q(r)-1, where r is root of derivative of Q. Does there exist an irrational number alpha > k such that floor(alpha^n) ≡ 0 mod 2017 for all n≥k?\"\n\nSo likely two answers are expected: the value k, and the \"yes\"/\"no\" answer.\n\nSince problem instructions are to provide only one answer value string, and in the example it shows mixing numerical and text possibly, I will output both answers separated by a space.\n\nHence answer is \"1 no\".\n\n---\n\nFinal output below.",
