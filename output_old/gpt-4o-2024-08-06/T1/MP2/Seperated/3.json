  "reasoning_content": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nProblem 1:\nGiven the equation \\(10d + 8 = 528\\).\n1. Subtract 8 from both sides: \n   \\(10d = 528 - 8 = 520\\).\n2. Divide both sides by 10:\n   \\(d = \\frac{520}{10} = 52\\).\n3. The problem asks for \\(2d\\):\n   \\(2d = 2 \\times 52 = 104\\).\n\nProblem 2:\n- Distance raced: 100 m.\n- Megan’s average speed: \\(\\frac{5}{4} \\, m/s = 1.25 \\, m/s\\).\n- Hana finished 5 seconds earlier than Megan.\n\n1. Calculate Megan's race time:\n   \\[\n   t_{Megan} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{100}{1.25} = 80 \\, \\text{seconds}\n   \\]\n\n2. Since Hana finished 5 seconds earlier:\n   \\[\n   t_{Hana} = t_{Megan} - 5 = 80 - 5 = 75 \\, \\text{seconds}\n   \\]\n\n3. Hana’s average speed:\n   \\[\n   v_{Hana} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{t_{Hana}} = \\frac{100}{75} = \\frac{4}{3} \\, m/s\n   \\]\n\nFinal answers:\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Solve 10d + 8 = 528. Subtract 8 from both sides to get 10d = 520. Divide both sides by 10 to find d = 52. The value of 2d is 2 * 52 = 104. Problem 2: Megan's speed is 5/4 m/s. Calculate Megan's time as distance/speed = 100 / (5/4) = 80 seconds. Hana finishes 5 seconds earlier, so her time is 80 - 5 = 75 seconds. Hana's average speed is distance/time = 100 / 75 = 4/3 m/s.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"104\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4/3\"\n}",
