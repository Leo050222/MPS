  "math_problem": "Solve for $2d$ if $10d + 8 = 528$. Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance $s$ equal to that solution plus 48. Megan and Hana raced their remote control cars for $s$ m. The two cars started at the same time. The average speed of Megan's car was $\\frac{5}{4} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Hana's car finished 5 seconds before Megan's car. What was the average speed of Hana's car?",
