  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Evaluating integer solutions**\n\nI’m considering divisibility and checking for integer solutions in the equation. It seems I only need to check positive integers from 1 to 7 because larger values of n lead to no solutions. When testing each integer, I find that n=2 and n=5 are solutions, while others do not yield integer results. I’ve also realized I can't include n=0 because the problem specifies positive integers. I'm wondering if there might be larger solutions with different multiples.**Confirming integer solutions**\n\nI'm reviewing the logic for solutions, particularly for n >= 8, where the fraction cannot produce integers due to the dominating n^2 term. I checked n=8 and found it doesn't work. The only valid solutions remain n=2 and n=5. I’m considering if larger n could satisfy the conditions without needing -7n+3 to be zero. But given how the remainders work out, it seems like no larger n will yield valid integers. It's looking solid with just those smaller values!**Exploring approaches and definitions**\n\nI'm considering using the greatest common divisor (gcd) to analyze the problem, particularly looking at how n^2 + 7 relates to 7n - 3. It’s clear that positive integers are specified, so that settles Problem 1 with solutions being 2 and 5. Moving on to Problem 2, I need to find values of m where the roots of 2x^2 - mx - 8 differ by m - 1. It seems \"differ by\" usually implies an absolute difference, so I'll work from there, ensuring m is at least 1 for valid differences.**Calculating root differences**\n\nI'm focusing on enforcing the condition for the roots' difference, which is |r1 - r2| = m - 1. I need to ensure distinct real roots exist, which requires the discriminant to be non-negative. After applying the quadratic formula, I find the discriminant Δ = m^2 + 64, which is always positive. So, there will always be distinct real roots for any m. For the difference, I end up with the formula involving √Δ and |a|, ensuring I handle any sign issues appropriately!**Determining values of m**\n\nI'm working through the problem of finding values of m where the zeros of 2x² - mx - 8 differ by m - 1. By enforcing the condition that the difference equals sqrt(Δ) / 2, I find that this needs to equal m - 1. Solving leads me to m=6, which fits the criteria while maintaining non-negative differences. I also encounter m=-10/3, but it doesn’t make sense in this context since it results in negative differences. So, I conclude that the only valid solution is m=6!**Crafting final JSON**\n\nI need to provide a JSON format summarizing the reasoning for the problems. For Problem 1, I can state that the difference equals sqrt(Δ) / 2, which I set equal to m - 1 and enforce m ≥ 1, leading to m = 6. For the answers, I'm thinking using \"2, 5\" as a comma-separated string since that feels natural. The reasoning will include a concise overview of both problems without too much detail. Let’s finalize the JSON!</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Write (n^3+3)/(n^2+7) = n + (-7n+3)/(n^2+7). For integrality, n^2+7 must divide -7n+3. For n ≥ 8, |-7n+3| < n^2+7, so the remainder must be 0, which is impossible. Check n = 1..7: only n = 2, 5 work. Problem 2: For 2x^2 - mx - 8, the root difference is sqrt(m^2+64)/2. Set this equal to m - 1 (thus m ≥ 1): sqrt(m^2+64) = 2(m-1) ⇒ 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0 ⇒ m = 6 or -10/3; only m = 6 satisfies m ≥ 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2, 5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
