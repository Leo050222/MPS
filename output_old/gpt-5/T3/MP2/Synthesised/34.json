  "math_problem": "Let $n=2000$ and $p=23$. The exponent of $p$ in $n!$ is $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\lfloor n / p^k \\rfloor$. Find the greatest positive integer $x$ such that $p^{6+x}$ divides $n!$.

  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Breaking down the problem**\n\nI need to solve a multi-part problem starting with given values n=2000 and p=23. I’ll find the exponent of p in n! using the formula that involves summing the floors of n divided by p raised to powers. Instead of finding the maximum exponent beyond 6, I'll compute m as the floor of 2000/23 minus 36. Then, I need to determine how many distinct absolute values appear in a random m-element subset of the symmetric set S, which consists of values from -100 to 100.**Calculating distinct absolute values**\n\nI’m figuring out how to compute the expected count of distinct absolute values from the set S, which ranges from 0 to 100. I can use linearity to sum the probabilities for each absolute value a appearing in a randomly chosen subset T of size m. \n\nFor a=0, it only corresponds to 0 itself. For a ≥ 1, it pairs -a and a. The probability of including 0 in T is m/201, based on uniform selection from 201 total elements in set S.**Calculating probabilities for values**\n\nI’m assessing the probability that for each value a in the range of 1 to 100, at least one of its pairs (-a, a) appears in the subset T. This is equivalent to 1 minus the probability that neither value is included in T. \n\nTo find this, I’ll calculate the chance of excluding both elements from my uniform sample of m from 201 total elements. This involves combinatorial calculations, leading me to the formula for the probability that at least one is present: 1 minus the ratio of combinations. I’m double-checking the factorial manipulations to ensure accuracy!**Calculating expected distinct absolute values**\n\nI’m working on finding the expected number of distinct absolute values. The formula combines P0 and the summed probabilities for pairs. First, I’ll compute m as the floor of 2000 divided by 23, which gives me 50 after subtracting 36. \n\nNow, P0 is 50/201, and I’ll calculate the pair probability based on the complement probability of inclusion. After computing the necessary products and simplifying, I find the inclusion probability is 117/268. Finally, I plug everything into the formula to find E, yielding 50/201 plus 11700/268, which simplifies to 2925/67.**Final reasoning and calculations**\n\nFirst, I compute m as the floor of 2000/23 minus 36, which gives me m = 50. The expected number E of distinct absolute values is calculated using probabilities:\n\n- For 0: The probability of including 0 is m/201, which is 50/201.\n- For a = 1 to 100: The probability that at least one of ±a is chosen is 1 - the probability that neither is included. This leads to a probability of 117/268 when m = 50.\n\nCombining these contributes to E being 8825/201. I ensure all calculations confirm this result. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"8825/201\"\n}\n```</think>\n\n- Compute m: floor(2000/23) = 86, so m = 86 - 36 = 50.\n- Let S have 201 elements. For expected distinct absolute values:\n  - For 0: P(0 in T) = m/201 = 50/201.\n  - For each a in 1..100: P({-a,a} intersects T) = 1 - C(199,m)/C(201,m) = 1 - ((201-m)(200-m))/(201*200) = 1 - (151*150)/(201*200) = 117/268.\n- Expected count = 50/201 + 100*(117/268) = 50/201 + 2925/67 = 8825/201.\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"8825/201\"\n}",
