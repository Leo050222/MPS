  "math_problem": "Find two lines of symmetry of the graph of the function $y=x+\\frac{1}{x}$. Express your answer as two equations of the form $y=a x+b$. Instead of determining the equations of the lines of symmetry, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote parallel to the y-axis, derived from the asymptotic analysis of the curve. Determine all triplets of real numbers $(x, y, z)$ satisfying the system of equations $x^{2} y+y^{2} z =k+1039$, $x^{2} z+z^{2} y =260$, $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) =-540$.",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing symmetry in functions**\n\nInstead of looking for equations of symmetry, I think I should focus on finding k, which relates to the Euclidean norm of the coefficients of the asymptote. This is from the asymptotic analysis of the curve. \n\nI need to determine the lines of symmetry for the function y = x + 1/x. It looks like this graph is a hyperbola, but is it symmetric about y=x or y=-x? I'll check if swapping x and y holds. It seems like it’s not symmetric in that way. I need to explore those transformations further.**Exploring symmetry lines**\n\nI noticed that the classic rectangular hyperbola, xy=1, has symmetry lines y=x and y=-x. For the curve y = x + 1/x, I'm wondering if it's symmetric about the line y=x. To check, I need to reflect points across the line—if they remain on the curve, that indicates symmetry. But it looks like this function isn't invariant under the transformation of the coordinates. \n\nPerhaps I could reparametrize by substituting \\( t = x - 1/x \\) or look at the relation F(x,y) = y - x - 1/x = 0 for symmetry. I just need to keep in mind the original problem asks for two lines of symmetry.**Testing symmetry and asymptotes**\n\nI remember that the curve might be symmetric regarding the lines y = x and y = -x. To test this, I’ll use the point (2, 2.5) as an example. Reflecting it across y = x gives (2.5, 2), but this point isn’t on the curve because 2.5 + 1/2.5 doesn’t equal 2. \n\nThen, reflecting across y = -x gives (-2.5, -2), and that doesn’t hold either. However, it seems the graph has two branches with asymptotes at y = x and y = -x. When x approaches infinity, y approaches x, confirming this behavior.**Identifying asymptotes**\n\nI’ve realized there’s an oblique asymptote at y=x and a vertical asymptote at x=0. When x approaches 0, y behaves like 1/x, which heads toward infinity, confirming that the vertical asymptote is x=0.\n\nThe equation for this vertical asymptote can be expressed as ax + by + c = 0, where a=1, b=0, and c=0. This gives me the coefficient vector (1,0). The Euclidean norm here is 1. I'm considering if scaling might introduce any changes to this relationship.**Solving for integer triples**\n\nThe coefficient vector is usually (1, 0), yielding a Euclidean norm of 1 unless there's a normalization requirement. The equation for the asymptote is x=0. I’ve determined that k, the norm, equals 1. \n\nNext, I'm forming a system using k; the equations seem cubic-like with potential integer solutions. I'll define variables for simplification, notably expressing y in terms of z. With possible integer divisors of 260 for z, I’ll compute valid x values. So far, I found some candidate solutions that checked out, but I’m also curious if non-integer z values might yield additional solutions.**Determining numeric solutions**\n\nThe third equation here allows for multiple solutions, but I’ve already derived that y=4z and z(x^2+4z^2)=260. I’m substituting variables to analyze the system and simplify it. After several transformations and substitutions, I’ve found two real solutions for the triplets: (16, 4, 1) and (1, 16, 4).\n\nNow, I realize they’re asking for a final answer in JSON format. I need to structure the answer to include these triplets effectively while maintaining the required format.**Finalizing answer structure**\n\nI need to present the final answer, which includes both the triplets and value k. The problem asks for both k and the triplets, but it's a bit ambiguous if they want everything included. Since they want a string format, I think it's safer to present it as “k=1; (16,4,1), (1,16,4)”. \n\nNow I’ll briefly summarize my reasoning, making sure to keep it high-level and concise, before formatting the JSON at the end. This way, I’ll meet all the requirements!</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Vertical asymptote of y = x + 1/x is x = 0, so the coefficient vector is (1, 0) and k = 1. From the first two equations, y(x^2 + yz) = 1040 and z(x^2 + yz) = 260 imply y = 4z and z(x^2 + 4z^2) = 260 with z > 0. Using (x - 4z)(4z - z)(z - x) = -540 leads to 3z(x - 4z)(x - z) = 540. Solving with x^2 + 4z^2 = 260/z yields z ∈ {1, 4}, and x = 16/z^2, y = 4z. Thus the real solutions are (16, 4, 1) and (1, 16, 4).\",\n    \"answer\": \"k=1; (16,4,1), (1,16,4)\"\n}",
