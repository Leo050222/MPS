  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Evaluating square numbers**\n\nI'm trying to list the squares between 32 and 99 and focus on those with all digits less than or equal to 5. When checking each square, I find that 32 squared is 1024, which is a candidate since all digits are valid. However, after modifying the digits and checking for squares, it turns out 2135 isn't valid. I keep going through the squares until I discover that 2025 meets the criteria with digits all under 6. So, it looks like that's my answer!**Finding polynomial remainder**\n\nI'm working on Problem 2, which involves a polynomial \\( P \\) and its remainders when evaluated at various points: \\( P(1) = -4 \\), \\( P(2) = -1 \\), and \\( P(3) = 4 \\). The task is to find the remainder when \\( P \\) is divided by the cubic \\( x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 \\), which factors into \\( (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) \\). The remainder will be a quadratic \\( R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\) matching the given values. \n\nAfter setting up the equations based on \\( R(1) \\), \\( R(2) \\), and \\( R(3) \\), I start subtracting to find \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\). From my progress, I find that \\( a = 1 \\). Now, I'm on the path to deducing the rest of the coefficients!**Finalizing polynomial remainder**\n\nI've found the coefficients for \\( R(x) \\): \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), and \\( c = -5 \\). This means the remainder when dividing by the cubic polynomial is \\( R(x) = x^2 - 5 \\). Now, I need to produce JSON with a concise reasoning field that summarizes both problems while ensuring that I follow the proper format. \n\nI'll include the answers as \"answer_1\": \"2025\" and \"answer_2\": \"x^2-5,\" making sure there are no extra keys outside of \"reasoning,\" \"answer_1,\" and \"answer_2\". I’ll keep everything clear and without any unnecessary spaces!**Crafting concise reasoning**\n\nThe intention is to create a plain text JSON format without anything else after it. For Problem 1, I examined 4-digit squares with all digits less than or equal to 5 and determined that \\( n = 2025 \\) works because increasing each digit leads to \\( 3136 \\), which is \\( 56^2 \\).\n\nFor Problem 2, I identified the divisor as \\( (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) \\) and found that the remainder is quadratic. By solving for the coefficients, I got \\( R(x) = x^2 - 5 \\). Now, I can return this as JSON!</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Check 4-digit squares with digits ≤5. 32^2=1024 (fails), 35^2=1225 (fails), 38^2=1444 (fails), 39^2=1521 (fails), 45^2=2025 works since adding 1 to each digit gives 3136=56^2. So n=2025. Problem 2: The divisor is (x-1)(x-2)(x-3). The remainder R(x) is quadratic with R(1)=-4, R(2)=-1, R(3)=4. Solve a+b+c=-4, 4a+2b+c=-1, 9a+3b+c=4 → a=1, b=0, c=-5, so R(x)=x^2-5.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2025\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"x^2-5\"\n}",
