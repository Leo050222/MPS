  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Clarifying candy scenarios**\n\nI'm considering if there’s any situation where equal numbers can be achieved by rearranging the candies without increasing their counts. The minimum number eaten seems to be 11. I need to check if we can discard an entire color, but that leaves us with zero candies of that color, which means we have to keep some. If blue only has 3, maximizing what’s left means I want to eat the least while keeping numbers equal, leading to the conclusion that the minimal candy eaten is still 11.**Creating valid JSON**\n\nI'm thinking through the JSON format I need to produce. It must include \"reasoning,\" \"answer_1,\" and \"answer_2,\" with the numbers provided as strings. The example mentioned a trailing comma, but I realize that we can't have that in valid JSON; it should end after the last field. I shouldn't add \"...\", only the specified fields. For the reasoning, I'll keep it concise with a simple explanation, like using equations to derive the totals.**Preparing JSON reasoning**\n\nI'm figuring out how to maximize the candies remaining for equality, which means the maximum common remainder is 3. This leads to eating a total of 11 candies. I have a concise reasoning that I'd like to express in the JSON. I'll phrase it without special Unicode characters, using standard ASCII instead. So, I'll replace the \"≤\" symbol with \"<=\" for compliance. The reasoning will summarize the problems and solutions clearly while maintaining a straightforward style.**Finalizing reasoning string**\n\nI’m crafting the reasoning string to make it clear and concise. It addresses two problems with straightforward calculations, ultimately leading to totals of 44 and 11 for the answers. I need to ensure that I adhere to ASCII formatting, so I won't use any math formatting or extra lines beyond the JSON block. I’ll keep the quotes around the keys and remember not to include any trailing commas. I think I’m ready to produce the JSON!</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: With S:B=7:4 and S-B=12, 7k-4k=12 => k=4 => S=28, B=16; total 44.
