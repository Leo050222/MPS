  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Solving equations and proportions**\n\nI’m looking at the equation \"x(1+y)=391\", which implies that x times (1+y) equals 391. For possible values, I realize y can’t be zero. After testing pairs, I find x=23 and y=16 works since it satisfies both conditions. Also, I tackle a second problem: with 30 people and 60% being men, I deduce that for the ratio of men to stay at 40%, 15 additional women must enter. So, the answers are 39 and 15 respectively.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI factored 391 and matched the factors to x and 1+y. Then, I solved the percentage equation 18/(30+w)=0.4. This feels right according to the guidelines; I just need to summarize briefly. I’ll format the JSON properly, ensuring there are no trailing commas, and include fields for \"reasoning,\" \"answer_1,\" and \"answer_2,\" with precise values of \"39\" and \"15.\" All this needs to be in plain text, and I’ll double-check the formatting to make sure it’s accurate.</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Set x(1+y)=391 and used factor pairs of 391 to find positive integers with x>y; then kept men fixed at 18 and solved 18/(30+w)=0.4 for w.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"39\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"15\"\n}",
