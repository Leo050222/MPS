  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Exploring function solutions**\n\nI'm working on the function f(x)=x and verifying its properties. It seems to solve f(x^2 + f(y)) = x^2 + y. I’m wondering if other solutions like f(x) = -x might work, but the math shows they don't match unless x=0.\n\nNow, I suspect the identity function might be the only solution. I need to prove its uniqueness using previously derived properties, including how f(f(y)) relates to a constant c. Setting x=0 leads me to a new equation involving t = f(0) and a. I'll keep working on this!**Analyzing function properties**\n\nI'm applying the function f to both sides of the equation, knowing that f(a) = 0. By substituting y=a into f(f(y)) = y + c, I find that it equates to f(0), which leads to t = a + c. \n\nAs I work through this, I discover that c matches t^2, aligning with the earlier definition of c. I realize I need more information to pinpoint f. Since f is bijective, I've concluded that the a satisfying f(a) = 0 is unique and should equal a = -t^2. I'll keep unraveling this!**Examining function behavior**\n\nI'm realizing that a might not necessarily equal -t^2 unless t is specifically 0 or 1. But I also have two equations from the functional equation (FE): one with y equal to a, and the other with y arbitrary. By subtracting these expressions, I get a new relationship involving y and a.\n\nI'm contemplating whether f could be odd or monotonic, but I think showing injectivity might be the way to go. Since f(f(y)) = y + t^2 demonstrates injectivity, I’ll use that along with the FE to possibly swap y with f(y) and see where it leads.**Exploring function properties further**\n\nI’m substituting y with f(y) in the functional equation, leading to an identity involving both sides. This could hint at a Cauchy-like property. I’m trying to find a simpler approach by setting x to make f(x) = 0. \n\nI recall that f(a) = 0, but now I’m considering whether there’s some b such that f(b) = -x^2. If I use x = a in the FE, I discover that f is surjective and acts as a left-inverse of itself, indicating it’s invertible. So, for all y, f(a^2 + f(y)) indeed equals y!**Analyzing function's properties**\n\nI've established that f is surjective and bijective, making f^{-1}(y) = a^2 + f(y). Now, I'm comparing equations f(a^2 + f(y)) and f(f(y)). By using injectivity, I can relate outputs that lead to the conclusion that a^2 + t^2 = 0, meaning both a and t are zero.\n\nSince I’ve confirmed several identities and properties of f, I’ll now prove its structure further. I know f is additive for nonnegative inputs, suggesting a Cauchy-like property for all reals. I'll explore this additivity more, especially focusing on the behavior of f with various inputs.**Exploring function linearity**\n\nI’m working through the properties of f and how it behaves on nonnegative reals. I’ve established that f is additive and nonnegative, suggesting that it might be linear if it’s also monotonic. I know nonnegative inputs lead to nonnegative outputs, and thanks to properties like Lagrange's four-square theorem, I can express any nonnegative real as a square.\n\nSince I've shown that if f(s) is nonnegative for all nonnegative s and additive, it must be of the form g(t) = ct for t ≥ 0. I'm seeing that continuity and monotonicity imply linearity. Finally, I'm determining the constants involved through functional equations and analyzing involution. It’s coming together nicely!**Finalizing function output**\n\nI’ve determined that the only function f that meets the criteria is f(x) = x for all real x. Looking at the requirements for the final JSON format, it seems best to stick to just providing the answer without any additional fields or reasoning, as that aligns with the instructions specifying no extra text before or after the JSON. So I’ll finalize my output as:\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"f(x)=x\"\n}</think>\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"f(x)=x\"\n}",
