  "math_problem": "Wendy eats sushi for lunch. She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, labeled as follows:\n\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} A & B & C \\\\ D & E & F \\\\ \\end{array}$\n\nwhere pieces are adjacent if they share a side (not counting diagonally), with adjacencies $A$-$B$, $A$-$D$, $B$-$C$, $B$-$E$, $C$-$F$, $D$-$E$, $E$-$F$. The pieces of sushi are distinguishable. She can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other remaining pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row. Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers randomly (and independently) chosen from the range $[0,1]$. Find the probability that $a$, $b$ and $k$ form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We have a 2x3 grid with adjacency edges: A-B, A-D, B-C, B-E, C-F, D-E, E-F. We are told to first eat the two endpoint pieces of the top row, which are A and C. After removing A and C (and only those), the remaining vertices are B, D, E, F. The induced subgraph on {B, D, E, F} keeps edges among these vertices: originally we had edges A-B, A-D, B-C, B-E, C-F, D-E, E-F. Removing vertices A and C eliminates edges involving them, leaving edges B-E, D-E, and E-F. So the induced graph on {B, D, E, F} has edges: B-E, D-E, E-F. The degree of F in this induced subgraph is the number of edges incident to F, which is just one edge (E-F), so deg(F) = 1. The problem then defines k = deg(F) + 0, so k = 1.\\n\\nNext, a and b are independent uniform random variables on [0,1]. We need the probability that a, b, and k form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle. Since k = 1, we consider sides a, b, 1. For three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two must exceed the third. The nontrivial condition here is a + b > 1, because 1 is the largest of the three (since a, b ≤ 1). The other conditions a + 1 > b and b + 1 > a automatically hold for a, b in [0,1]. So triangle condition is a + b > 1.\\n\\nFor obtuseness, recall that a triangle with side lengths x ≤ y ≤ z is obtuse if and only if z^2 > x^2 + y^2. In our case, since k = 1 is the largest side, we set z = 1 and x = a, y = b (though a and b may not be ordered, but the inequality is symmetric in them). The obtuse condition is 1^2 > a^2 + b^2, i.e., a^2 + b^2 < 1. Thus, we need a, b in [0,1] satisfying both a + b > 1 and a^2 + b^2 < 1.\\n\\nThis is a geometric probability problem over the unit square [0,1] x [0,1]. The total area is 1. We want the area of the region where both constraints hold:\\n1) a + b > 1 (region above the diagonal line from (0,1) to (1,0))\\n2) a^2 + b^2 < 1 (inside the quarter of the unit circle of radius 1 centered at (0,0) in the first quadrant).\\n\\nWe find the intersection of the line a + b = 1 with the quarter circle a^2 + b^2 = 1 in the first quadrant. Substitute b = 1 - a into a^2 + b^2 = 1:\\n a^2 + (1 - a)^2 = 1\\n a^2 + 1 - 2a + a^2 = 1\\n 2a^2 - 2a + 1 = 1\\n 2a^2 - 2a = 0\\n 2a(a - 1) = 0\\nSo a = 0 or a = 1. That gives the intersection points (0,1) and (1,0). On [0,1]^2, the quarter circle lies completely above the line a + b = 1 except along those boundary points. This can be verified at, say, (0.5,0.5): a + b = 1 (on the line) but a^2 + b^2 = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 < 1 (inside circle). For points with a + b > 1, they lie above the diagonal; for example, (0.8,0.8) satisfies a + b = 1.6 > 1 and a^2 + b^2 = 1.28 > 1 (outside the circle). The boundary inequality suggests that the portion of the quarter circle in the unit square is entirely in the region a + b ≥ 1, because the circle only touches the axes at (1,0) and (0,1) and lies strictly inside the square elsewhere. Indeed, for any point in the quarter circle with both coordinates in (0,1), we have a^2 + b^2 < 1, which implies a < 1 and b < 1, and the circle between (1,0) and (0,1) lies above the line a + b = 1 in the first quadrant.\\n\\nMore systematically, we can parameterize the first-quadrant quarter circle by a = cos θ, b = sin θ, for θ in [0, π/2]. On this circle, a + b = cos θ + sin θ. The minimum of cos θ + sin θ on [0, π/2] occurs at θ = 0 or θ = π/2, giving value 1; in the interior it is greater than 1. Therefore, for all points on the circle except the endpoints, a + b > 1. Thus, the entire interior of the quarter circle has a + b > 1. Therefore, the intersection of the region a^2 + b^2 < 1 with the unit square [0,1]^2 is fully contained within the half-plane a + b > 1. Consequently, the constraints reduce simply to a^2 + b^2 < 1; the condition a + b > 1 is automatically satisfied for those points in the quarter circle interior that lie in the square.\\n\\nTo be precise, the domain is [0,1] x [0,1]. The region a^2 + b^2 < 1 in this domain is just the quarter-disk of radius 1 in the first quadrant. Its area is (π * 1^2) / 4 = π/4. Since this entire quarter disk except for the boundary points satisfies a + b > 1 or equals 1 on the line endpoints, the measure of the set where a + b ≤ 1 and a^2 + b^2 < 1 is zero. So the measure of the intersection region is the area of the quarter disk itself, π/4.\\n\\nThus, the probability that a and b chosen uniformly from [0,1] yield an obtuse triangle with sides a, b, 1 is the area of that region divided by the area of the unit square, which is 1. Therefore the probability is π/4.\",\n    \"answer\": \"pi/4\"\n}",
