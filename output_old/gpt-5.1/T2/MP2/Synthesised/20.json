Instead of finding all positive integers making the given rational expression a positive integer, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the positive integer such that for each such positive integer, it equals the value of the expression plus $k$. Find all the values of $m$ for which the zeros of $2 x^{2}-m x-8$ differ by $|m - k|$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We want positive integers n such that (n^3+3)/(n^2+7) is a positive integer. Perform polynomial division: n^3+3 = n(n^2+7) - 7n + 3, so (n^3+3)/(n^2+7) = n + (3-7n)/(n^2+7). Let this equal an integer t. Then 3-7n = t( n^2+7 ) - n^3. Rearranging using p = (n^3+3)/(n^2+7) = t, we get n^3 - t n^2 -7n + (7t -3)=0. But we can instead directly set p = (n^3+3)/(n^2+7) and consider the linear remainder condition: (3-7n)/(n^2+7) must be integer. Since |3-7n| < n^2+7 for n≥2 except possibly small n, the only possibilities are when 3-7n=0 or for small n where the fraction might be ±1, ±2 etc. Check n=1: (1+3)/(1+7)=4/8=1/2 not integer. n=2: (8+3)/(4+7)=11/11=1 integer. n=3: (27+3)/(9+7)=30/16=15/8 not. For n≥4, n^2+7 grows faster, and |3-7n|<n^2+7 so the only way is 3-7n=0 → n=3/7 not integer. Thus the only positive integer n is 2, and the value of the expression is p=(2^3+3)/(2^2+7)=11/11=1. The problem introduces k such that for each such n, we have n = p + k. Since n=2 and p=1, we get 2 = 1 + k, so k=1. Next, we must find all m such that the zeros of 2x^2 - m x - 8 differ by |m-k|=|m-1|. For quadratic ax^2+bx+c, the roots differ by Δx = √(b^2-4ac)/a. Here a=2, b=-m, c=-8. Discriminant D = m^2 -4*2*(-8)=m^2+64. So the distance between roots is √(m^2+64)/2. Condition: √(m^2+64)/2 = |m-1|. Square both sides: (m^2+64)/4 = (m-1)^2. Multiply by 4: m^2+64 = 4(m-1)^2 = 4(m^2 -2m+1)=4m^2-8m+4. Rearrange: 0 = 4m^2-8m+4 - (m^2+64) =3m^2 -8m -60. Solve 3m^2-8m-60=0. Discriminant: (-8)^2 -4*3*(-60)=64+720=784=28^2. So m = [8 ± 28]/(2*3) = [8 ± 28]/6. That gives m1 = (8+28)/6 = 36/6 = 6, and m2 = (8-28)/6 = -20/6 = -10/3. Both satisfy the squared equation, and they also satisfy the original positive distance condition: for m=6, |m-1|=5>0; for m=-10/3, |m-1|=| -13/3|=13/3>0, and the quadratic has real roots for all m since m^2+64>0. So the values of m are 6 and -10/3.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6,-10/3\"\n}",
