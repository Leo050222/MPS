  "math_problem": "The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to $k>0$, find $k$. Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition. A ladder is leaning against a house with its lower end $d$ feet from the house. When the lower end is pulled 9 feet farther from the house, the upper end slides 13 feet down. How long is the ladder (in feet)?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Let the rectangle have width w and length 3w. Perimeter P = 2(w + 3w) = 8w, area A = w·3w = 3w². Given P = A = k > 0, set 8w = 3w² ⇒ 3w² - 8w = 0 ⇒ w(3w - 8) = 0. Since w > 0, w = 8/3. Then d = w + 37/3 = 8/3 + 37/3 = 45/3 = 15. So the ladder initially is 15 ft from the house, and its top is at some height h. Let the ladder length be L. Initially: L² = 15² + h². After pulling the bottom 9 ft farther, the bottom is 15 + 9 = 24 ft from the house, and the top slides 13 ft down, so its new height is h - 13. The ladder length remains L, so L² = 24² + (h - 13)². Set the two expressions for L² equal: 15² + h² = 24² + (h - 13)². Compute: 225 + h² = 576 + h² - 26h + 169. Combine constants on the right: 576 + 169 = 745, so 225 + h² = 745 + h² - 26h. Subtract h² from both sides: 225 = 745 - 26h. Then -520 = -26h ⇒ h = 20. Plug back to find L: L² = 15² + 20² = 225 + 400 = 625, so L = 25 (positive length). The ladder is 25 feet long.\",\n    \"answer\": \"25\"\n}",
