  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe want positive integers n such that (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) is a positive integer.\\nLet k = (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7), so n^3 + 3 = k(n^2 + 7) = kn^2 + 7k.\\nRearrange to get a cubic in n: n^3 - k n^2 - 7k + 3 = 0. For given integer k, n must be an integer root.\\nInstead, use polynomial division to simplify the expression:\\n(n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) = n - 7n/(n^2 + 7) + 3/(n^2 + 7) (more systematically: divide n^3 + 3 by n^2 + 7).\\nPerform division:\\n(n^3 + 3) ÷ (n^2 + 7): first term is n, giving n(n^2 + 7) = n^3 + 7n.\\nSubtract: (n^3 + 3) - (n^3 + 7n) = -7n + 3.\\nSo (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) = n + (-7n + 3)/(n^2 + 7).\\nThus the expression is an integer iff (n^2 + 7) divides -7n + 3.\\nLet d = n^2 + 7. Then d | (-7n + 3). Also clearly d | d = n^2 + 7.\\nSo d must divide any integer linear combination, in particular:\\nCompute 7n^2 + 49 = 7(n^2 + 7), so d | 7(n^2 + 7).\\nAlso we have -7n + 3. Form a combination that eliminates n:\\nConsider ( -7n + 3 )^2 = 49n^2 - 42n + 9.\\nBut more directly, use: d | (-7n + 3) and d | (n^2 + 7).\\nFrom n^2 ≡ -7 (mod d).\\nMultiply this congruence by 7: 7n^2 ≡ -49 (mod d).\\nNow 7n^2 ≡ (7n)(n) (not very helpful). Instead, express -7n + 3 in terms of d and n:\\nWe want | -7n + 3 | ≤ n^2 + 7 for all possible divisors, and since n^2 + 7 is positive, the only way it can divide -7n + 3 is that the absolute value of -7n + 3 is at least n^2 + 7 or equal to it or zero. But for large n, | -7n + 3 | grows linearly, while n^2 + 7 grows quadratically, so for sufficiently large n we must have | -7n + 3 | < n^2 + 7, forcing -7n + 3 = 0 as the only possibility when divisibility holds. However, check the inequality properly.\\nWe need n^2 + 7 ≤ | -7n + 3 | or | -7n + 3 | = 0 for divisibility unless we are in the case that the quotient is 0, but the quotient 0 is impossible because n^3 + 3 > 0 and denominator > 0.\\nCheck whether | -7n + 3 | < n^2 + 7 for all n ≥ 1. If true for all n, then the only way n^2 + 7 divides -7n + 3 is that -7n + 3 = 0.\\nConsider f(n) = n^2 + 7 - | -7n + 3 |.\\nWe only need a rough bound: for n ≥ 1, n^2 dominates 7n.\\nCase 1: -7n + 3 ≥ 0 → 3 ≥ 7n → n ≤ 3/7, impossible for positive integers n.\\nSo for all positive integer n, -7n + 3 < 0, so | -7n + 3 | = 7n - 3.\\nThus we need to compare n^2 + 7 and 7n - 3.\\nCompute n^2 + 7 - (7n - 3) = n^2 - 7n + 10 = (n - 2)(n - 5).\\nSo the sign:\\n- If 2 < n < 5, then (n - 2)(n - 5) < 0, so n^2 + 7 < 7n - 3.\\n- If n ≤ 2 or n ≥ 5, then n^2 + 7 ≥ 7n - 3.\\nTherefore:\\n- For n ≤ 2 or n ≥ 5, we have | -7n + 3 | = 7n - 3 ≤ n^2 + 7, so divisibility allows the possibilities 7n - 3 = 0 or n^2 + 7 = 7n - 3 (or n^2 + 7 could be a proper divisor of 7n - 3 if 7n - 3 is larger, but in these ranges 7n - 3 ≤ n^2 + 7, so 7n - 3 cannot be larger). Hence in these ranges, the only way for n^2 + 7 to divide 7n - 3 is if 7n - 3 = 0 or |7n - 3| = n^2 + 7.\\n- For 2 < n < 5, i.e. n = 3, 4, we have 7n - 3 > n^2 + 7, so we need n^2 + 7 to be a factor of 7n - 3 with quotient ≥ 2.\\nSo we break into cases:\\n1) n ≤ 2 or n ≥ 5: require 7n - 3 = 0 or 7n - 3 = n^2 + 7.\\nEquation 7n - 3 = 0 → n = 3/7, not integer.\\nEquation 7n - 3 = n^2 + 7 → n^2 - 7n + 10 = 0 → (n - 2)(n - 5) = 0 → n = 2 or n = 5.\\nBoth are in the allowed ranges.\\n2) n = 3 or 4: compute explicitly.\\nFor n = 3: denominator = 3^2 + 7 = 16, numerator = 3^3 + 3 = 30, 30/16 = 15/8, not integer.\\nFor n = 4: denominator = 4^2 + 7 = 23, numerator = 4^3 + 3 = 67, 67/23 ≈ 2.91, not integer.\\nThus the only positive integers n that work are n = 2 and n = 5.\\nVerify:\\nFor n = 2: (8 + 3)/(4 + 7) = 11/11 = 1, integer.\\nFor n = 5: (125 + 3)/(25 + 7) = 128/32 = 4, integer.\\nSo Problem 1 answer: n = 2, 5.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have quadratic 2x^2 - m x - 8. Let its roots be r1 and r2.\\nGiven that the zeros differ by m - 1: |r1 - r2| = m - 1 (typically \\\"differ by\\\" means absolute difference).\\nWe also know:\\nSum of roots: r1 + r2 = m/2 (since for ax^2 + bx + c, sum = -b/a; here a = 2, b = -m, so sum = -(-m)/2 = m/2).\\nProduct of roots: r1 r2 = -8/2 = -4.\\nDifference of roots from standard formula:\\nFor quadratic 2x^2 - m x - 8 = 0, discriminant Δ = b^2 - 4ac = (-m)^2 - 4·2·(-8) = m^2 + 64.\\nRoots: (m ± sqrt(m^2 + 64))/4.\\nDifference: r1 - r2 = ( (m + sqrt(m^2 + 64))/4 ) - ( (m - sqrt(m^2 + 64))/4 ) = (2 sqrt(m^2 + 64))/4 = sqrt(m^2 + 64)/2.\\nSo |r1 - r2| = sqrt(m^2 + 64)/2.\\nWe are told that the zeros differ by m - 1. As a size, this should be nonnegative, so we impose m - 1 ≥ 0 → m ≥ 1.\\nThen we set:\\nsqrt(m^2 + 64)/2 = m - 1.\\nMultiply both sides by 2:\\nsqrt(m^2 + 64) = 2(m - 1).\\nRight-hand side must be nonnegative; with m ≥ 1, it is.\\nSquare both sides:\\nm^2 + 64 = 4(m - 1)^2 = 4(m^2 - 2m + 1) = 4m^2 - 8m + 4.\\nBring all terms to one side:\\n0 = 4m^2 - 8m + 4 - (m^2 + 64) = 3m^2 - 8m - 60.\\nThus 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0.\\nSolve this quadratic:\\nDiscriminant: D = (-8)^2 - 4·3·(-60) = 64 + 720 = 784.\\nsqrt(D) = 28.\\nSo m = [8 ± 28]/(2·3) = (8 ± 28)/6.\\nTwo solutions:\\n1) m = (8 + 28)/6 = 36/6 = 6.\\n2) m = (8 - 28)/6 = -20/6 = -10/3.\\nNow recall the condition m ≥ 1 from m - 1 ≥ 0. That rules out m = -10/3.\\nAlso check the original condition directly for m = 6 to ensure no extraneous root from squaring.\\nFor m = 6, quadratic is 2x^2 - 6x - 8 = 0 → divide by 2: x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0.\\nRoots: (3 ± sqrt(9 + 16))/2 = (3 ± 5)/2 → roots: 4 and -1.\\nDifference |4 - (-1)| = 5.\\nNow m - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5. Condition satisfied.\\nFor m = -10/3, check.\\nQuadratic: 2x^2 + (10/3)x - 8 = 0.\\nBut more straightforward, check our formula: |r1 - r2| = sqrt(m^2 + 64)/2.\\nCompute m - 1 = -10/3 - 1 = -13/3, negative, which cannot equal a nonnegative distance. So this is extraneous.\\nTherefore the only valid value is m = 6.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: n = 2, 5.\\nProblem 2: m = 6.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2, 5\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
