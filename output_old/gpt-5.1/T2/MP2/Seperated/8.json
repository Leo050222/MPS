Distances in the complex plane are moduli of complex differences.\\n\\nSaturday path: start at z, last house at z^2013. Given distance from start to last house is sqrt(2012):\\n|z^2013 - z| = sqrt(2012).\\nFactor:\\nz^2013 - z = z(z^2012 - 1), so |z||z^2012 - 1| = sqrt(2012).  (1)\\n\\nSunday path: start at 1, last house at z^2012. Distance from 1 to z^2012 is sqrt(2012):\\n|z^2012 - 1| = sqrt(2012).  (2)\\n\\nCompare (1) and (2):\\n|z||z^2012 - 1| = |z^2012 - 1| = sqrt(2012).\\nIf |z^2012 - 1| ≠ 0, divide both sides by |z^2012 - 1| to get |z| = 1.\\nIf |z^2012 - 1| = 0, then z^2012 = 1 and |z^2012 - 1| = 0 contradicts the given distance sqrt(2012) ≠ 0, so that case is impossible.\\nHence |z| = 1.\\n\\nWe want Re(z^2). Write z = e^{iθ} (since |z|=1). Then z^2 = e^{2iθ}, and Re(z^2) = cos(2θ).\\n\\nNow use the Sunday distance condition:\\n|z^2012 - 1|^2 = (sqrt(2012))^2 = 2012.\\nCompute:\\nz^2012 = (e^{iθ})^{2012} = e^{i·2012θ}.\\n|e^{i·2012θ} - 1|^2 = (e^{i·2012θ} - 1)(e^{-i·2012θ} - 1) = 2 - e^{i·2012θ} - e^{-i·2012θ} = 2 - 2cos(2012θ).\\nThus,\\n2 - 2cos(2012θ) = 2012.\\nDivide by 2:\\n1 - cos(2012θ) = 1006.\\nSo cos(2012θ) = 1 - 1006 = -1005.\\nBut cos(2012θ) must be between -1 and 1 for any real θ, so no such real θ exists.\\nThus there is no complex number z (with a real angle θ) satisfying the distance conditions. The system is inconsistent, so Problem 1 as stated has no solution. Therefore Re(z^2) is undefined in the usual sense.\\n\\nGiven the instructions demand an exact value for the answer, but the math yields impossibility, the logically correct conclusion is that there is no such z, and hence no real part can be determined.\\n\\nProblem 2\\nLet the six digits be d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6, each in {1,…,9}. For each k = 1..6, the integer formed by the first k digits is divisible by k.\\nWe will count all such 6-digit sequences.\\n\\nStep 1: Constraints from each position\\nk = 1: Number d1 divisible by 1 ⇒ any digit 1..9. So 9 possibilities for d1.\\n\\nk = 2: 2-digit number 10d1 + d2 divisible by 2 ⇒ last digit d2 is even. From {1..9}, evens are {2,4,6,8}. So d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8} (4 choices).\\n\\nk = 3: 3-digit number 100d1 + 10d2 + d3 divisible by 3. Divisibility by 3 depends on sum of digits:\\n(d1 + d2 + d3) ≡ 0 (mod 3).\\nSo given d1,d2, d3 is determined mod 3: d3 ≡ -(d1 + d2) (mod 3), with allowed digits 1..9.\\n\\nk = 4: 4-digit number divisible by 4 depends on last two digits: 10d3 + d4 divisible by 4.\\nSo (10d3 + d4) mod 4 = 0, with d3,d4 ∈ {1..9}.\\n\\nk = 5: 5-digit number divisible by 5 means last digit d5 must be 5 (since only 5 among 1..9 works). So d5 = 5.\\n\\nk = 6: 6-digit number divisible by 6 means divisible by 2 and 3. Divisible by 2: d6 even. Divisible by 3: sum of digits (d1+…+d6) ≡ 0 (mod 3).\\n\\nStep 2: Systematic enumeration via modular constraints\\nBecause digits are small and modular constraints are simple, we can reason systematically.\\n\\nWe track:\\n- d1 ∈ {1..9}\\n- d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\n- For each (d1,d2), d3 must satisfy both the k=3 and k=4 constraints together with future consistency.\\n\\nk=3 condition: d1 + d2 + d3 ≡ 0 (mod 3).\\nSo d3 ≡ -(d1 + d2) (mod 3).\\nAmong digits 1..9, each residue mod 3 appears exactly three times:\\nResidue 0: 3,6,9\\nResidue 1: 1,4,7\\nResidue 2: 2,5,8.\\n\\nk=4 condition: 10d3 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 4).\\nNote 10 ≡ 2 (mod 4), so 10d3 + d4 ≡ 2d3 + d4 (mod 4).\\nThus 2d3 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 4).\\nGiven d3 (1..9), we must choose d4 (1..9) satisfying this.\\n\\nWe also need future divisibility by 3 for k=6, which is about total sum S6 = d1+…+d6.\\nWe know for k=3: S3 = d1+d2+d3 ≡ 0 (mod 3).\\nFor k=5: d5 = 5, so S5 = S3 + d4 + 5.\\nFor divisibility by 3 at k=6: S6 = S5 + d6 ≡ 0 (mod 3). Since d6 is even, this just adds a condition linking d4 and d6 mod 3.\\n\\nRather than attempt a messy pure-hand enumeration, we exploit symmetry and modular structure.\\n\\nObservation: Divisibility by 3\\nS3 ≡ 0 (mod 3).\\nThen S5 = S3 + d4 + 5 ≡ d4 + 2 (mod 3).\\nSo S6 = S5 + d6 ≡ d4 + 2 + d6 (mod 3).\\nFor S6 ≡ 0 (mod 3), we need d4 + d6 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\\n\\nSo the remaining constraints are:\\n- d1 ∈ {1..9}\\n- d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\n- d3 chosen such that S3 ≡ 0 (mod 3)\\n- d4 such that 2d3 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 4)\\n- d5 = 5\\n- d6 even, and d4 + d6 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\\n\\nCount systematically:\\n1) Choose d1, d2 and corresponding d3.\\n2) For each d3, choose valid d4 from the 4-condition.\\n3) For each (d4), count how many even d6 satisfy d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3.\\n\\nStep 2.1: Compute possibilities per residue class of (d1,d2)\\nLet r = (d1 + d2) mod 3.\\nThen d3 must be ≡ -r (mod 3).\\nWe don’t need exact d1,d2, just their residues and counts.\\n\\nDigits mod 3:\\n- Class 0: {3,6,9} (3 digits)\\n- Class 1: {1,4,7} (3 digits)\\n- Class 2: {2,5,8} (3 digits)\\n\\nd1 from {1..9}: 3 choices per residue.\\nEven digits for d2 are {2,4,6,8} distributed by mod 3:\\n2 ≡ 2, 4 ≡ 1, 6 ≡ 0, 8 ≡ 2.\\nSo counts:\\n- residue 0: {6} → 1 digit\\n- residue 1: {4} → 1 digit\\n- residue 2: {2,8} → 2 digits.\\n\\nNumber of (d1,d2) pairs by residues (a,b) where a=d1 mod 3, b=d2 mod 3:\\n- d1 residue a each has 3 options.\\n- d2 residue b has count c_b: c_0=1, c_1=1, c_2=2.\\nSo there are 3*c_b pairs for each b, split across a, but we care about r = (a+b) mod 3.\\n\\nCompute counts of pairs per r:\\nEnumerate:\\nFor each a in {0,1,2} (3 values each with 3 digits):\\n- a=0: d1 count 3.\\n  b=0: d2 count1 → r=0, pairs: 3*1 = 3.\\n  b=1: d2 count1 → r=1, pairs: 3*1 = 3.\\n  b=2: d2 count2 → r=2, pairs: 3*2 = 6.\\n- a=1: d1 count 3.\\n  b=0: r=1, 3*1=3.\\n  b=1: r=2, 3*1=3.\\n  b=2: r=0, 3*2=6.\\n- a=2: d1 count 3.\\n  b=0: r=2, 3*1=3.\\n  b=1: r=0, 3*1=3.\\n  b=2: r=1, 3*2=6.\\n\\nSum per r:\\n- r=0: from (a=0,b=0)=3, (a=1,b=2)=6, (a=2,b=1)=3 → total 12.\\n- r=1: from (a=0,b=1)=3, (a=1,b=0)=3, (a=2,b=2)=6 → total 12.\\n- r=2: from (a=0,b=2)=6, (a=1,b=1)=3, (a=2,b=0)=3 → total 12.\\nTotal (d1,d2) pairs: 12+12+12=36, consistent with 9 choices for d1 times 4 for d2.\\nSo for each r (0,1,2), there are 12 pairs.\\n\\nStep 2.2: Choices for d3\\nFor given r, d3 must be ≡ -r (mod 3). Each residue class has exactly 3 digits (1..9). So for each (d1,d2) pair, there are 3 possible d3.\\nNumber of (d1,d2,d3) triples:\\nFor each r: 12 * 3 = 36.\\nTotal across r: 3*36 = 108 triples.\\nBut we must carry the residue of d3 mod 3 and its value mod 4 to proceed.\\n\\nWe categorize by d3:\\nDigits 1..9 with residues mod 3 and values mod 4:\\n1: (mod3 1, mod4 1)\\n2: (2, 2)\\n3: (0, 3)\\n4: (1, 0)\\n5: (2, 1)\\n6: (0, 2)\\n7: (1, 3)\\n8: (2, 0)\\n9: (0, 1)\\n\\nFor each r, the allowable d3 (d3 ≡ -r mod 3) are:\\n- r=0: d3 ≡ 0 → {3,6,9}\\n- r=1: d3 ≡ 2 → {2,5,8}\\n- r=2: d3 ≡ 1 → {1,4,7}.\\n\\nStep 2.3: Count valid d4 for each d3 using 2d3 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 4)\\nFor each d3 from 1..9, compute needed d4 residues and count of digits 1..9 that fit.\\n\\nWe need d4 from {1..9} so that 2d3 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 4).\\nEquivalently, d4 ≡ -2d3 (mod 4).\\nCompute 2d3 mod 4 and then the required d4 mod 4.\\nDigits 1..9 mod 4:\\n1→1, 2→2, 3→3, 4→0, 5→1, 6→2, 7→3, 8→0, 9→1.\\nEach residue 0..3 appears counts:\\n- 0: {4,8} → 2 digits\\n- 1: {1,5,9} → 3 digits\\n- 2: {2,6} → 2 digits\\n- 3: {3,7} → 2 digits.\\n\\nCompute per d3:\\n- d3=1: 2d3 ≡ 2 → need d4 ≡ -2 ≡ 2 mod 4. So d4 mod4 =2; digits {2,6}; count 2.\\n- d3=2: 2d3 ≡ 4 ≡ 0 → need d4 ≡ 0; digits {4,8}; count 2.\\n- d3=3: 2d3 ≡ 6 ≡ 2 → need d4 ≡ 2; digits {2,6}; count 2.\\n- d3=4: 2d3 ≡ 8 ≡ 0 → need d4 ≡ 0; digits {4,8}; count 2.\\n- d3=5: 2d3 ≡10≡2 → need d4 ≡ 2; digits {2,6}; count 2.\\n- d3=6: 2d3 ≡12≡0 → need d4 ≡ 0; digits {4,8}; count 2.\\n- d3=7: 2d3 ≡14≡2 → need d4 ≡ 2; digits {2,6}; count 2.\\n- d3=8: 2d3 ≡16≡0 → need d4 ≡ 0; digits {4,8}; count 2.\\n- d3=9: 2d3 ≡18≡2 → need d4 ≡ 2; digits {2,6}; count 2.\\nSo regardless of d3, there are always exactly 2 possible d4.\\n\\nSo for each (d1,d2,d3), there are 2 valid d4.\\nTotal (d1,d2,d3,d4) tuples: 108 * 2 = 216.\\n\\nStep 2.4: Count valid d6 given d4\\nWe know d5=5, and we need d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3, with d6 even in {2,4,6,8}.\\nCompute residues:\\nEven digits mod 3:\\n2→2, 4→1, 6→0, 8→2.\\nSo counts:\\n- residue 0: {6} → 1\\n- residue 1: {4} → 1\\n- residue 2: {2,8} → 2.\\n\\nFor a given d4, let a = d4 mod 3.\\nWe need d6 ≡ 1 - a mod 3.\\nWe count how many even digits have that residue.\\nWe must know residue of d4. But d4 is either in {2,6} or {4,8}, depending on d3.\\nResidues:\\n2 (mod 3 is 2), 6 (mod 3 is 0) → set {2,6} gives residues {2,0}.\\n4 (mod 3 is 1), 8 (mod 3 is 2) → set {4,8} gives residues {1,2}.\\n\\nWe must treat both sets {2,6} and {4,8} and count suitable d6 for each possible d4.\\nWe also weight by how many times each d4 appears across all earlier choices.\\n\\nWe first analyze per type of d3 (since that determines whether d4 is from {2,6} or {4,8}).\\nRecall:\\n- For d3 ∈ {1,3,5,7,9} (odd d3), d4 ∈ {2,6}.\\n- For d3 ∈ {2,4,6,8} (even d3), d4 ∈ {4,8}.\\nLooking at our mapping above: d3=1,3,5,7,9 use d4∈{2,6}; d3=2,4,6,8 use d4∈{4,8}.\\n\\nNow we need to know which d3 values are actually allowed given r. For each r:\\n- r=0: d3 ∈ {3,6,9} → includes one from {2,6,4,8}-type, etc.\\nClassify:\\n  d3=3 (odd) → d4∈{2,6}.\\n  d3=6 (even) → d4∈{4,8}.\\n  d3=9 (odd) → d4∈{2,6}.\\nSo for r=0, two of the three d3 values use d4∈{2,6}, one uses d4∈{4,8}.\\n\\n- r=1: d3 ∈ {2,5,8}.\\n  d3=2 (even) → d4∈{4,8}.\\n  d3=5 (odd) → d4∈{2,6}.\\n  d3=8 (even) → d4∈{4,8}.\\nSo for r=1, one uses {2,6}, two use {4,8}.\\n\\n- r=2: d3 ∈ {1,4,7}.\\n  d3=1 (odd) → d4∈{2,6}.\\n  d3=4 (even) → d4∈{4,8}.\\n  d3=7 (odd) → d4∈{2,6}.\\nSo for r=2, two use {2,6}, one uses {4,8}.\\n\\nBut we can avoid this detail if we recognize that r is uniformly distributed: each r has 12 (d1,d2) pairs, and then 3 d3 options. However, the mix of {2,6} vs {4,8} across all triples might be symmetric. Let's compute total proportion of d3 categories directly.\\n\\nAmong digits 1..9, d3’s allowed per r are:\\n- r=0: {3,6,9} (2 odd,1 even)\\n- r=1: {2,5,8} (2 even,1 odd)\\n- r=2: {1,4,7} (2 odd,1 even)\\nSince we multiply each allowed d3 by 12 (d1,d2) pairs per r, the counts for each specific d3 are uniform within their r-group.\\n\\nBut we only need aggregate over all triples (d1,d2,d3). Total triples = 108.\\nCount how many of these have d3 odd vs even.\\nFor r=0: each of the 3 d3 values occurs for 12 (d1,d2) pairs. So 12 triples per d3.\\n- d3=3 odd: 12\\n- d3=6 even: 12\\n- d3=9 odd: 12\\nTotal r=0: 24 odd,12 even.\\n\\nFor r=1:\\n- d3=2 even: 12\\n- d3=5 odd: 12\\n- d3=8 even: 12\\nTotal r=1: 12 odd,24 even.\\n\\nFor r=2:\\n- d3=1 odd: 12\\n- d3=4 even: 12\\n- d3=7 odd: 12\\nTotal r=2: 24 odd,12 even.\\n\\nSumming over r:\\nTotal odd d3 = 24+12+24 = 60.\\nTotal even d3 = 12+24+12 = 48.\\nCheck: 60+48 = 108.\\n\\nFor each triple (d1,d2,d3), d4 has 2 choices. But the type of choices depends on whether d3 is odd or even:\\n- If d3 odd: d4 ∈ {2,6}.\\n- If d3 even: d4 ∈ {4,8}.\\nSo\\n- For 60 odd-d3 triples → 2 choices for d4 from {2,6}.\\n- For 48 even-d3 triples → 2 choices for d4 from {4,8}.\\nTotal 60*2 + 48*2 = 120+96 = 216 tuples, consistent.\\n\\nNow determine, for each possible specific d4 value in each set, how many d6 work.\\n\\nCase A: d4 ∈ {2,6}.\\nResidues mod 3:\\n2 ≡ 2, 6 ≡ 0.\\nWe need d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3.\\nEvaluate for each d4.\\n- If d4=2 (≡2): need d6 ≡ 1 - 2 ≡ -1 ≡ 2 mod 3.\\nEven digits with residue 2: {2,8}. So 2 choices for d6.\\n- If d4=6 (≡0): need d6 ≡ 1 mod 3 → only even digit with residue 1 is 4.\\nSo 1 choice for d6.\\nThus, for a given triple ending with a particular d4 in {2,6}, the number of completions for d6 is 2 if d4=2 and 1 if d4=6.\\n\\nWe also need to know how often d4=2 vs d4=6 among the odd-d3 tuples.\\nFrom earlier constraint: for odd d3, d4 must be ≡ 2 mod 4. The digits ≡2 mod4 in {1..9} are exactly {2,6}. The congruence 2d3+d4≡0 mod4 gives two solutions in {2,6}. We should check which d4’s are valid for each odd d3.\\n\\nCompute for each odd d3 in {1,3,5,7,9}:\\n- d3=1: 2d3=2; need d4≡-2≡2 mod4 → {2,6} both work.\\nCheck explicitly: 2*1+2=4≡0, 2*1+6=8≡0.\\n- d3=3: 2d3=6≡2; need d4≡2 mod4 → {2,6}.\\n- d3=5: 2d3=10≡2; need d4≡2 → {2,6}.\\n- d3=7: 2d3=14≡2; need d4≡2 → {2,6}.\\n- d3=9: 2d3=18≡2; need d4≡2 → {2,6}.\\nSo for each odd d3, both d4=2 and d4=6 are allowed; nothing biases one over the other. So for a fixed odd-d3 triple, there are exactly two extensions: one with d4=2 and one with d4=6.\\nHence among odd-d3 tuples (60 triples), after adding d4, we get:\\n- 60 tuples with d4=2\\n- 60 tuples with d4=6.\\n\\nNow each such (d1,d2,d3,d4) tuple extends to ID numbers via choices of d6 as:\\n- d4=2 → 2 choices of d6\\n- d4=6 → 1 choice of d6.\\nSo total completions from odd-d3 side:\\n60*2 + 60*1 = 120 + 60 = 180.\\n\\nCase B: d4 ∈ {4,8} (even d3)\\nResidues mod 3:\\n4 ≡ 1, 8 ≡ 2.\\nWe need d4 + d6 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\\n- If d4=4 (≡1): need d6 ≡ 0 mod 3 → only even digit with residue 0 is 6.\\nSo 1 choice.\\n- If d4=8 (≡2): need d6 ≡ 1 - 2 ≡ 2 mod 3.\\nEven digits with residue 2: {2,8}. So 2 choices.\\n\\nAs before, we must know how often d4=4 vs d4=8 among even-d3 tuples.\\nEven d3 ∈ {2,4,6,8}. For each such d3, the 4-divisibility condition is 2d3 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod4) with d4≡0 mod4, so d4 ∈ {4,8}. Check both options always work:\\n- d3=2: 2d3=4≡0; d4≡0 gives 4 or 8.\\n- d3=4: 2d3=8≡0; d4≡0 gives 4 or 8.\\n- d3=6: 2d3=12≡0; d4≡0 gives 4 or 8.\\n- d3=8: 2d3=16≡0; d4≡0 gives 4 or 8.\\nSo each even-d3 triple also has two options for d4: 4 and 8. Thus for 48 even-d3 triples, after d4 we obtain:\\n- 48 tuples with d4=4\\n- 48 tuples with d4=8.\\nThen completions with d6:\\n- d4=4 → 1 choice for d6\\n- d4=8 → 2 choices for d6.\\nTotal completions from even-d3 side:\\n48*1 + 48*2 = 48 + 96 = 144.\\n\\nTotal number of valid 6-digit IDs:\\nOdd-d3 side: 180\\nEven-d3 side: 144\\nGrand total: 180 + 144 = 324.\\n\\nSo there are 324 possible ID numbers satisfying the given divisibility chain. (We already know 123252 is one example.)\\n\\nFinal results:\\nProblem 1: No complex number satisfies the stated distance conditions (impossible system), so Re(z^2) cannot be determined as a real value.\\nProblem 2: The number of possible IDs is 324.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"no solution\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"324\"\n}",
