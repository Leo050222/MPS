  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1\\nWe have a single-elimination (knockout) tournament with 32 players, so there are 5 rounds (since 2^5 = 32). Ava and Tiffany are two specific players. We want the probability that they ever play each other at some point during the tournament, given that in each round, pairings are uniform at random among the remaining players, and each match is fair (but the fairness of wins/losses doesn't affect the pairing structure). A standard symmetry argument: in a knockout tournament with random pairings each round, for any fixed pair of distinct players A and B, the probability they meet at some point equals the probability that if we track A's path through the bracket until either A or B is eliminated, B is the one who eliminates A or is eliminated by A.\\n\\nMore directly, there is a known simple approach using linearity of expectation and counting of possible opponents: Every match in the tournament is between two distinct players out of 32. The total number of matches is 31 (each match eliminates one player; 32 players, single winner). For any specific pair (Ava, Tiffany), we can consider: in each round, conditional on both being still alive, the probability they are paired is 1 / (remaining_players - 1). However, that approach requires summing over survival states, which is messy. There is a more elegant symmetry argument.\\n\\nIdea: Consider revealing the entire random tournament structure (who plays whom and who wins) by the standard method: at each round, we choose a uniform random perfect matching between the remaining players, and then pick winners uniformly. Equivalently, if we only care about whether Ava and Tiffany meet, we can instead imagine a random full bracket on 32 players, then random outcomes. But because pairings each round are uniformly random, the structure is statistically the same as assigning a fixed random full bracket at the start, with the 32 players assigned uniformly at random to initial bracket slots. Under a random full 32-player bracket (a rooted knockout tree with 32 labeled leaves) where the leaves are a random permutation of the players, the probability that two given players meet at any point depends only on the shape of the tree. In the standard balanced 32-player binary tree (5 rounds), two leaves meet at the exact round corresponding to the depth of their lowest common ancestor. For a uniformly random permutation of players in a fixed bracket, the event that Ava and Tiffany ever play is just the event that their leaves are in the same subtree that eventually collides, which for a complete balanced bracket always happens unless they are placed in different halves at each level. However, this is overcomplicating.\\n\\nA more straightforward and very standard result: In a knockout tournament with uniformly random pairings each round, the probability that two given players ever meet equals 1/(number of players - 1) + 1/(number of players - 1) + ... isn't constant per round, but there is an easier complement argument: consider the path of Ava. Every match Ava plays, she faces some opponent. Because of symmetry, conditional on the identity of all 31 matches (winners/losers), all other 31 players are equally likely to be the list of opponents Ava meets over the course of the tournament (with length equal to the number of matches she plays). However, the number of matches Ava plays is random. But a key trick: pick a random player R among the 31 players not Ava. The distribution of \\\"is R ever an opponent of Ava\\\" is the same as \\\"is Tiffany ever an opponent of Ava\\\" because Tiffany is just one such player. So the probability we're after is the expected number of distinct opponents Ava faces, divided by 31 (since expectation of indicator = probability, and linearity over the random choice of R). But the expected number of distinct opponents Ava faces is exactly the expected number of matches she plays. In a single-elimination tournament with fair matches, the expected number of matches a given player plays is 1. This can be argued: there are 31 matches total; by symmetry, each player has the same expected number of matches; since the sum over all players of matches played equals 2 * (number of matches) = 62, the average matches per player is 62 / 32 = 31/16. That approach would yield 31/16, which is not 1, so we must be careful.\\n\\nLet's calculate correctly. Each match has 2 participants, so total participations (match slots) = 2 * 31 = 62. Sum over all 32 players of the (random) number of matches they play equals 62. By symmetry, expected matches per player is 62/32 = 31/16, not 1. That is the expected number of matches played by a random player. So the expected number of distinct opponents Ava faces equals 31/16. Now, when picking at random another player R among the 31 others, the probability that R appears in Ava's opponent set equals (expected size of opponent set)/31 by symmetry: P(R is an opponent of Ava) = E[size of Ava's opponent set]/31 = (31/16)/31 = 1/16. That is exactly the desired probability: the chance that a fixed other player (Tiffany) is among Ava's opponents. So the probability that Ava and Tiffany ever play is 1/16.\\n\\nWe can cross-check using another method. Ava will play between 0 and 5 matches, depending on results. Suppose we fix an arbitrary tournament outcome tree, but randomize the initial mapping of player labels to slots. The chance that Tiffany appears in Ava's path is the number of distinct opponents along that path divided by 31. Averaging over the random outcome tree, the expected path length is the average number of matches per player, 31/16. So the overall probability is again 1/16. So the answer is 1/16.\\n\\nThus a = 1, b = 16, so 100a + b = 100*1 + 16 = 116.\\n\\nProblem 2\\nWe want real p and integer c ≠ 0 such that, for all x with 0 < x < 10^{-100}, we have\\nc - 0.1 < x^p * ((1 - (1 + x)^{10}) / (1 + (1 + x)^{10})) < c + 0.1.\\nThis says that for very small positive x, the expression\\nF(x) = x^p * ((1 - (1 + x)^{10}) / (1 + (1 + x)^{10}))\\nremains within 0.1 of the constant c for all sufficiently small x (in fact on the entire interval (0,10^{-100})). That essentially means F(x) must have a finite nonzero limit as x → 0^+, and that limit must be an integer c ≠ 0, because for such a tiny interval the function must be extremely flat to stay in a width-0.2 band.\\n\\nWe analyze asymptotics as x → 0.\\nLet u = (1 + x)^{10}. Then u ≈ 1 + 10x + 45x^2 + ... (via binomial expansion). Write the inner fraction:\\nG(x) = (1 - u) / (1 + u).\\nWe expand for small x.\\nFirst, u = (1 + x)^{10} = 1 + 10 x + 45 x^2 + 120 x^3 + ...\\nThus 1 - u = -(10 x + 45 x^2 + 120 x^3 + ...).\\nAlso 1 + u = 2 + 10x + 45x^2 + ... = 2(1 + (10/2)x + (45/2)x^2 + ... ) = 2(1 + 5x + (45/2)x^2 + ... ). So\\nG(x) = (1 - u)/(1 + u) = - (10 x + 45 x^2 + 120 x^3 + ... ) / (2 + 10x + 45x^2 + ...).\\nWe can factor out 2 from denominator to get\\nG(x) = -1/2 * (10 x + 45 x^2 + 120 x^3 + ...) / (1 + 5x + (45/2)x^2 + ... ).\\nWe now expand this as a power series in x. The leading numerator term is 10x, so G(x) is of order x near 0. More systematically, we can do a series expansion forming numerator/denominator.\\nLet N(x) = 10 x + 45 x^2 + 120 x^3 + ...\\nLet D(x) = 1 + 5x + d2 x^2 + ... (with d2 = 45/2 etc.). For small x, 1/D(x) = 1 - 5x + (25 - d2) x^2 + ...; we only really need the leading term for our p choice. So\\nN(x) / D(x) = (10x + 45 x^2 + ...) * (1 - 5x + O(x^2)).\\nMultiply:\\n(10x)(1 - 5x + ...) + 45x^2(1 + ...) = 10x - 50x^2 + 45x^2 + ... = 10x - 5x^2 + ...\\nThus\\nG(x) = -1/2 * (10x - 5x^2 + O(x^3)) = -5x + (5/2)x^2 + O(x^3).\\nSo as x → 0,\\nG(x) ~ -5x.\\nMore succinctly, since (1 + x)^{10} = 1 + 10x + O(x^2), we could have written directly:\\n1 - (1 + x)^{10} = -10x + O(x^2),\\n1 + (1 + x)^{10} = 2 + 10x + O(x^2) = 2(1 + 5x + O(x^2)),\\nso\\nG(x) = (1 - (1 + x)^{10}) / (1 + (1 + x)^{10}) = (-10x + O(x^2)) / (2 + 10x + O(x^2)) = (-10x + O(x^2))/2 * (1 + O(x))^{-1} = -5x + O(x^2).\\nThus the leading behavior is indeed G(x) ≈ -5x.\\n\\nHence\\nF(x) = x^p * G(x) ≈ x^p * (-5x) = -5 x^{p+1} (ignoring higher-order corrections like x^{p+2}, etc.).\\nWe need F(x) to stay close to a nonzero constant c as x → 0. Evaluate limit behavior of -5x^{p+1} as x → 0^+:\\n- If p + 1 > 0 (i.e., p > -1), then x^{p+1} → 0, so F(x) → 0. Then for sufficiently small x, F(x) would be arbitrarily close to 0, contradicting the requirement that it remain within 0.1 of an integer c ≠ 0, because c must be at least 1 in magnitude. For example, if c = 1, near x=0 we would have |F(x)| < 0.1 while |F(x) - 1| ≈ 1, which fails.\\n- If p + 1 < 0 (i.e., p < -1), then x^{p+1} → +∞ as x → 0^+, so |F(x)| grows without bound in magnitude; it cannot stay within a fixed bound 0.1 of any fixed c.\\n- If p + 1 = 0, i.e. p = -1, then x^{p+1} = x^0 = 1, so\\nF(x) ≈ -5 + O(x).\\nThen F(x) tends to -5 as x → 0^+, and the error from higher-order terms is on the order of x, which can be made arbitrarily small on (0,10^{-100}). More precisely, if we choose p = -1, then\\nF(x) = x^{-1} * ((1 - (1 + x)^{10}) / (1 + (1 + x)^{10})).\\nWe know from our expansion that\\nG(x)/x = (-5x + O(x^2))/x = -5 + O(x).\\nSo F(x) = -5 + O(x).\\nFor 0 < x < 10^{-100}, the error term O(x) is at most some constant times 10^{-100}, which is astronomically less than 0.1; so certainly we can find a bound |F(x) + 5| < 0.1 for all such x. The inequality in the problem is strict and must hold for all x in that interval, not just for sufficiently small ones, but 10^{-100} is extremely small, so the first-order expansion arguments guarantee that the difference from -5 can be bounded by, say, 10^{-10} or far smaller. To be rigorous in principle, we could bound the remainder term using binomial expansion up to a certain order and then bounding the tail using |x| ≤ 10^{-100}, but the leading term structure already shows that F(x) → -5 and the correction is of order x; plugging x ≤ 10^{-100}, we get corrections on the order of 10^{-100}, which is clearly less than 0.1.\\n\\nThus the only possible p that gives a finite, nonzero limit is p = -1, and the limiting constant is c = -5. We must also verify c is an integer with c ≠ 0, which is true: c = -5.\\n\\nTherefore the ordered pair (p, c) is (-1, -5).\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: 116\\nProblem 2: (p, c) = (-1, -5).\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"116\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"(-1,-5)\"\n}",
