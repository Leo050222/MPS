  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe have 6 distinguishable sushi pieces on a 2×3 grid. The constraint: Wendy can only eat a piece if it is adjacent (up/down/left/right) to at most two other remaining pieces at that moment. We need to count permutations (orders) of the 6 specific cells such that, for each step, the chosen cell has degree ≤ 2 in the induced subgraph of remaining cells.\\n\\nModel the grid as a graph with vertices A,B,C on top row and D,E,F on bottom row:\\nTop row: A-B-C\\nBottom row: D-E-F\\nVertical edges: A-D, B-E, C-F\\nEdges: A-B, B-C, D-E, E-F, A-D, B-E, C-F.\\nDegrees in full graph: B,E have degree 4; A,C,D,F have degree 2.\\nAny vertex of degree 4 cannot be eaten first because 4 > 2. In general, at each step in the remaining graph, we must choose a vertex whose current degree ≤ 2.\\n\\nWe count all permutations of {A,B,C,D,E,F} satisfying this property. Rather than brute force by hand, we analyze structurally:\\n\\n1) First move: vertices with degree ≤ 2 at start are A,C,D,F (each degree 2). So the first piece must be one of {A,C,D,F}. Let’s consider symmetry to reduce cases. The grid has a 180° rotational symmetry mapping A↔F, B↔E, C↔D, so positions come in three pairs: {A,F}, {B,E}, {C,D}.\\n\\nBy symmetry, the number of valid permutations starting with A equals those starting with C, D, or F when mapped appropriately. So count for one representative and multiply, but we must be careful since the graph is not fully symmetric between all four: A is a corner above D; C is above F; D and F are bottom corners. However 180° rotation maps A↔F and C↔D, giving two orbits of corners: {A,F} and {C,D}. So we need two base cases: one for A (or F) and one for C (or D).\\n\\nBut there is a nicer characterization: At any stage, vertices with initial degree 4 (B,E) can only be eaten after some of their neighbors are removed so that their degree drops to 2 or less. We need to track how removal affects degrees.\\n\\nInstead of doing a purely theoretical derivation, imagine we enumerate systematically with the constraint:\\n- At each step, compute current degrees and choose any vertex with degree ≤ 2.\\n\\nWe can reason via patterns of which of {B,E} are gone.\\n\\nDegrees in terms of neighbor existence (R indicates remaining):\\n- deg(A) = 1 if B not R and D R, or B R and D not R; 2 if both B,D R; 0 if neither R.\\n- deg(B) = I(A R) + I(C R) + I(E R) + I( (top-middle vertical) = E )? plus I(A),I(C),I(E). Similarly for others.\\n\\nThis becomes quite case-heavy. A more reliable approach is to consider that the condition is exactly: the maximum degree in the remaining graph is ≤ 2 when you pick that vertex. Since the graph has max degree 4 only at B,E, we only need to ensure that whenever we pick B or E, enough neighbors have been removed.\\n\\nFor B (neighbors A,C,E), and for E (neighbors D,F,B,C?), let’s explicitly list neighbors:\\n- N(A) = {B,D}\\n- N(B) = {A,C,E}\\n- N(C) = {B,F}\\n- N(D) = {A,E}\\n- N(E) = {D,F,B}\\n- N(F) = {C,E}\\n(Here we’ve omitted vertical C-F? Actually correct adjacencies in 2×3 grid are:\\nA: B,D\\nB: A,C,E\\nC: B,F\\nD: A,E\\nE: D,F,B\\nF: C,E\\nNo direct C-F vertical beyond that; that’s already included.)\\nSo degrees: deg(B)=3, deg(E)=3, others are 2.\\nThus initial allowed vertices: all except B,E. The rule at any step is: you cannot remove B or E while they currently have degree 3; you can remove them once some neighbors have gone so deg≤2.\\n\\nWe now do a structured enumeration by the order in which B and E are removed, because other vertices always have degree ≤2, so they are always allowed whenever present.\\n\\nKey observation: Only B and E can ever be forbidden; A,C,D,F are always legal choices while present. So any permutation is valid iff whenever B or E appears in the sequence, at that moment they have at most 2 remaining neighbors.\\n\\nWhen is B forbidden? Exactly when all three neighbors A,C,E are still present. So B cannot be first among the set {A,B,C,E}. Similarly E cannot be first among {D,E,F,B}. Put another way:\\n- In the subsequence induced by {A,B,C,E}, B cannot be the first element.\\n- In the subsequence induced by {D,E,F,B}, E cannot be the first element.\\n\\nWe must count permutations of 6 distinct letters satisfying both constraints simultaneously.\\nThis is now purely combinatorial and can be handled with inclusion-exclusion.\\n\\nLet total permutations = 6! = 720.\\nDefine bad events:\\n- X: B is first among {A,B,C,E} in the permutation.\\n- Y: E is first among {D,E,F,B}.\\nWe want permutations avoiding both X and Y.\\n\\nWe need |X|, |Y|, and |X∩Y|.\\nGeneral fact: For a subset S of k labelled items, the probability that a given one (say s0) is the earliest in the permutation is 1/k, since all relative orders equally likely. So:\\n- P(X) = 1/4, so |X| = 720/4 = 180.\\n- P(Y) = 1/4, so |Y| = 180.\\nFor intersection, we need probability that B is earliest in {A,B,C,E} and E is earliest in {D,E,F,B}. We consider the earliest among the union set U = {A,B,C,D,E,F} = all six. For these two conditions to both hold, the earliest among all 6 must be either B or E; otherwise if, say, A is first, then B cannot be earliest in {A,B,C,E}.\\nWe can do a direct symmetry argument:\\nAnother approach: order the six randomly. The relative order of the four in S1={A,B,C,E} is random; similarly for S2={D,E,F,B}. The events are not independent because the permutations share B.\\nLet’s count directly |X∩Y|.\\n\\nCondition X: among A,B,C,E, the earliest is B.\\nCondition Y: among D,E,F,B, the earliest is E? Wait, definition: Y=E earliest in {D,E,F,B}. (Be careful: neighbours of E are D,F,B.) So yes.\\nSo X says: earliest position among the set {A,B,C,E} is occupied by B.\\nY says: earliest position among {D,E,F,B} is E.\\nIn particular, combining them imposes B after E in the sub-permutation of {B,E} plus some constraints vs others.\\nLook at the relative order of the 6 letters. We can proceed by counting linear extensions under constraints:\\n- Among {A,B,C,E}: B must precede A,C,E? No: earliest among A,B,C,E means B appears before A,C,E. So constraints: B<A, B<C, B<E.\\n- Among {D,E,F,B}: E appears before D,F,B. So constraints: E<D, E<F, E<B.\\nThus we have a partial order on {A,B,C,D,E,F} given by:\\nE<B, E<D, E<F, and B<A, B<C, B<E.\\nNote B<E and E<B together imply impossible cycle. Therefore there is no permutation satisfying both X and Y.\\nSo |X∩Y|=0.\\nThus |X ∪ Y| = |X|+|Y| = 360; valid permutations = 720-360 = 360.\\n\\nTherefore number of valid orders Wendy can eat the sushi is 360.\\n\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nLet sides be a,b,1 with a,b ∈ [0,1]. For a triangle with sides (a,b,1), triangle inequalities:\\n1) a + b > 1\\n2) a + 1 > b, which always holds since b ≤1 ⇒ 1 ≥ b so a+1 ≥1≥b; strict > is automatic for any a>0 or even a=0 gives 1> b unless b=1. So except the single point (a,b)=(0,1) it holds; that point has measure zero.\\n3) b + 1 > a, similarly always true except measure-zero boundary.\\nSo the region of valid triangles is {(a,b) ∈ [0,1]^2 : a + b > 1} (ignoring a+b=1 boundary).\\n\\nNow we need probability that the triangle is obtuse. For sides x≥y≥z, triangle is obtuse iff x^2 > y^2 + z^2. Here the largest side is 1 (since a,b ≤ 1 and 1 is fixed). So obtuse condition is:\\n1^2 > a^2 + b^2 ⇒ a^2 + b^2 < 1.\\nEquilateral/right/acute boundaries when a^2 + b^2 = 1; no obtuse if a^2 + b^2 ≥ 1 (and triangle still exists).\\nSo we need (a,b) in the square [0,1]^2 satisfying:\\n- a + b > 1 (triangle)\\n- a^2 + b^2 < 1 (obtuse)\\nProbability = area of region / total area of square = area(region), since total area is 1.\\n\\nSo compute area of intersection between the unit quarter disk a^2 + b^2 < 1 in first quadrant and the half-plane above the line a + b = 1 with a,b∈[0,1]. Graphically, this is the portion of the quarter unit disk lying above the line a + b = 1 in the unit square.\\nThe quarter disk a^2 + b^2 ≤ 1 in [0,1]^2 has boundary arc from (1,0) to (0,1). The line a+b=1 is exactly the straight segment between (1,0) and (0,1). So our region is the curvilinear segment between this line and the arc inside the square.\\nThus area = ∫ over a from 0 to1 of [min(1, sqrt(1-a^2)) - max(0, 1-a)]_+; but we restrict to where both constraints apply: a+b>1 ⇒ b>1-a; a^2+b^2<1 ⇒ b< sqrt(1-a^2). Intersect domain where 1-a < sqrt(1-a^2). Also a,b∈[0,1].\\n\\nWe need the a-range where 1-a < sqrt(1-a^2). Solve inequality:\\n1 - a < sqrt(1 - a^2), with 0≤a≤1.\\nBoth sides nonnegative for 0≤a≤1, so square both sides:\\n(1 - a)^2 < 1 - a^2\\n1 - 2a + a^2 < 1 - a^2\\n-2a + a^2 < -a^2\\n2a^2 - 2a < 0\\n2a(a -1) < 0 ⇒ a(a-1) < 0 ⇒ 0 < a < 1.\\nSo strict inequality holds for all a in (0,1). At endpoints:\\na=0: left 1, right 1 ⇒ equality; a=1: left 0, right 0 ⇒ equality. But endpoints have zero measure, so for integration domain we can take a from 0 to1: the region a+b>1 & a^2+b^2<1 within square is:\\n0≤a≤1, 1-a < b < sqrt(1-a^2).\\nSince for all interior a, 1-a < sqrt(1-a^2), the vertical slice is nonempty.\\nNote that near a=0, b goes from 1 to 1 (just boundary), and near a=1, from 0 to 0; but integral handles that.\\nSo area:\\nA = ∫_0^1 [sqrt(1-a^2) - (1-a)] da.\\nCompute this integral.\\nSplit:\\nA = ∫_0^1 sqrt(1-a^2) da - ∫_0^1 (1-a) da.\\nFirst integral I1 = ∫_0^1 sqrt(1-a^2) da. This is area of quarter unit circle: π/4.\\nSecond integral I2 = ∫_0^1 (1-a) da = [a - a^2/2]_0^1 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\\nSo A = π/4 - 1/2.\\nSince total area is 1, probability = A = π/4 - 1/2.\\n\\nThus:\\nProblem 1 answer: 360.\\nProblem 2 answer: π/4 - 1/2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"360\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"pi/4-1/2\"\n}",
