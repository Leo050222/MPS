  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe have a multiplicative-like function f with the rule f(a·b) = f(a) + f(b). No explicit base value is given, but the conditions specify values for special arguments:\\n- f(n) = 0 if n is perfect.\\n- f(n) = 0 if the last digit of n is 4.\\nWe interpret this as: whenever the argument n itself is perfect OR ends with digit 4, then f(n) is forced to be 0; otherwise we use multiplicativity.\\nWe need f(1998). First factor 1998:\\n1998 = 2 · 999\\n999 = 3³ · 37\\nSo 1998 = 2 · 3³ · 37.\\nUsing f(ab) = f(a) + f(b), extend to prime power factorization:\\nFor n = p₁^{e₁} p₂^{e₂} ... p_k^{e_k}, we get\\nf(n) = f(p₁^{e₁}) + ... + f(p_k^{e_k}).\\nAlso, for p^e, we can separate repeatedly:\\n f(p^e) = f(p^{e-1}·p) = f(p^{e-1}) + f(p) = ... = e · f(p).\\nSo f(n) = Σ e_i f(p_i).\\nThus,\\nf(1998) = f(2) + 3 f(3) + f(37).\\nNow check if any of these arguments (2, 3, 37, 1998) are perfect or end in 4:\\n- 2: divisors (proper) = {1}, sum = 1 ≠ 2 ⇒ not perfect; last digit 2 ⇒ not 4.\\n- 3: divisors (proper) = {1}, sum = 1 ≠ 3 ⇒ not perfect; last digit 3 ⇒ not 4.\\n- 37: divisors (proper) = {1}, sum = 1 ≠ 37 ⇒ not perfect; last digit 7 ⇒ not 4.\\n- 1998: last digit 8 ⇒ not 4. Proper divisors' sum isn’t evidently 1998, and 1998 is not among known small perfect numbers (6, 28, 496, 8128, ...). So 1998 is not perfect.\\nThus none of these numbers (2,3,37,1998) fall under the zero conditions, so the special rules don’t directly fix f(2), f(3), or f(37). However, typically in such functional equations, the only consistent solution fitting the given special-value constraints and multiplicativity is f(n) = 0 for all n: if f is additive over multiplication and zero on infinitely many values with various factor structures, the natural intended contest solution is the identically zero function. Under that interpretation, f(2) = f(3) = f(37) = 0, so\\nf(1998) = 0 + 3·0 + 0 = 0.\\nTherefore, the intended value is f(1998) = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nThe beaver walks from (0,0) to (4,4), moving only right (R: +1 in x) or up (U: +1 in y), and must never visit a point with y > x. The condition y ≤ x describes staying on or below the diagonal y = x.\\nFrom (0,0) to (4,4) using only R and U has total length 8 steps: 4 R and 4 U. Without restrictions, the number of paths is C(8,4). With the restriction y ≤ x at all times, these are precisely the classic Catalan paths (Dyck paths) of semilength 4.\\nThe number of such paths is the 4th Catalan number:\\nC₄ = (1/(4+1)) * C(2·4, 4) = (1/5) * C(8,4).\\nCompute C(8,4) = 70, so\\nC₄ = 70 / 5 = 14.\\nThus there are 14 valid paths.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\n- Problem 1: 0\\n- Problem 2: 14\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"14\"\n}",
