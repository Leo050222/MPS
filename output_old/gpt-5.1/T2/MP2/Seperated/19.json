First compute xy and y:\\nxy = x(1 + 22/(x - 1)) = x + 22x/(x - 1).\\nEquation (5): x^2 + xy - 19x - y + 51 = 0 becomes:\\nx^2 + (x + 22x/(x - 1)) - 19x - (1 + 22/(x - 1)) + 51 = 0.\\nGroup: x^2 + x - 19x - 1 + 51 = x^2 - 18x + 50.\\nThe fractional part: 22x/(x - 1) - 22/(x - 1) = 22(x - 1)/(x - 1) = 22.\\nSo total: x^2 - 18x + 50 + 22 = x^2 - 18x + 72 = 0.\\nSolve: x^2 - 18x + 72 = 0.\\nDiscriminant: 18^2 - 4*72 = 324 - 288 = 36, sqrt = 6.\\nThus x = (18 ± 6)/2 gives x = 12 or x = 6.\\nCase 1: x = 12.\\nThen (x - 1)(y - 1) = 22 ⇒ 11(y - 1) = 22 ⇒ y - 1 = 2 ⇒ y = 3.\\nThen z = 19 - x - y = 19 - 12 - 3 = 4.\\nCheck (1): xy + z = 12*3 + 4 = 36 + 4 = 40 ✓.\\nCheck (2): xz + y = 12*4 + 3 = 48 + 3 = 51 ✓.\\nCase 2: x = 6.\\nThen (x - 1)(y - 1) = 22 ⇒ 5(y - 1) = 22 ⇒ y - 1 = 22/5 ⇒ y = 27/5.\\nThen z = 19 - 6 - 27/5 = (95 - 30 - 27)/5 = 38/5.\\nCheck (1): xy + z = 6*(27/5) + 38/5 = (162 + 38)/5 = 200/5 = 40 ✓.\\nCheck (2): xz + y = 6*(38/5) + 27/5 = (228 + 27)/5 = 255/5 = 51 ✓.\\nThus the solution set is the two ordered triples: (12, 3, 4) and (6, 27/5, 38/5).\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have 21 distinct skill levels 1,...,21; higher skill always wins. One active player, others inactive. Each round: choose a random inactive player to play the active; higher skill wins and becomes active, loser eliminated. 20 rounds, 1 survivor. Alice has skill 11; we seek her expected number of games.\\nKey idea: The process is equivalent to successively selecting a random remaining opponent for the current active player, and the maximum skill among the players not yet eliminated will eventually become champion. The evolution of active status is a Markov chain where activity always follows the current highest skill among remaining players, except when the current active is higher than the chosen opponent, in which case it stays.\\nBecause the choice of the initial active competitor is uniform over the 21 players, and subsequent inactive choices are uniform over remaining inactives, symmetry suggests using linearity of expectation and conditioning on which players Alice faces.\\nFor each other competitor j (skill s_j ≠ 11), define indicator X_j = 1 if Alice ever plays a game against that competitor, 0 otherwise. Then the total number of games Alice plays is N = sum over j≠Alice of X_j, so E[N] = sum E[X_j]. We must compute, for each skill level k ≠ 11, the probability that Alice and that competitor meet at some point.\\nIn this knockout structure, two players will meet if and only if, at some time before one of them is eliminated by a stronger player, they simultaneously remain in the tournament and one is chosen to be active while the other is chosen to play, without any stronger player intervening first in a way that eliminates one of them.\\nA more convenient view uses the total order by skill and the fact that higher skill always wins. Consider only the subset of players whose skills lie between the two players' skills (inclusive). The interaction between any two given players depends only on the relative ordering and the randomness of selection, not on absolute labels or on players outside this interval, because stronger players outside this interval will always defeat both and, when they enter as active, they effectively end the possibility of weaker players playing each other if they haven't yet.\\nWe can exploit a known result: in this tournament variant, the probability that two players i and j ever meet depends only on the set of players whose skills lie between them. Specifically, for two players a < b in skill, among the players with skills in [a, b], the process restricted to these players behaves like the same random active/inactive tournament, except that players outside this interval can eliminate both a and b via higher-skill interventions, but that does not affect the probability that a and b play conditional on neither being eliminated by a higher outside player before they meet. However, higher players can intervene before they have a chance to meet, lowering that probability. Computing the exact pairwise meeting probabilities directly with such external interference is messy.\\nInstead, use a dynamic perspective on the sequence of active players as the stronger contestants arrive. Observe:\\n- The absolute strongest player, skill 21, can never lose and will eventually become champion.\\n- When a new higher-skilled player is selected as opponent to the current active, they defeat the active and become active.\\nConsider the tournament evolution if we ignore matches between players who are both weaker than some stronger player that has already appeared; only the active player matters at each stage.\\nAnother approach: track Alice's status as the set of participants shrinks. At any given time, either Alice has been eliminated (0 more games), or she is active, or she is inactive. When she is active, she plays every subsequent round until she loses or until the tournament ends, but her opponent each round is a random inactive.\\nDefine states by the set of surviving skill levels relative to Alice. However, enumerating all 2^20 subsets is infeasible symbolically.\\nWe look for a structural simplification. Note that players with skills < 11 can never eliminate Alice, while players with skills > 11 always eliminate her if they face her. Thus Alice's survival and games are governed by two independent aspects:\\n- How many weaker players (1–10) she beats.\\n- Whether and when she encounters stronger players (12–21).\\nKey observation: The sequence of elimination outcomes, if we look only at the relative order of skill eliminations, corresponds to repeatedly choosing a random ordered pair (active, inactive) among remaining players, but the match outcome depends only on the higher skill. However, the probabilities of which pair meets depend on the evolving active status, so it is not equivalent to uniformly random unordered pairs.\\nWe can find a more direct probabilistic characterization: At any time when Alice is still in the tournament, the active player is always the strongest among all players seen so far in the active position. But because the initial active player is uniform, and every time a stronger player appears they become active, we can interpret the process as follows:\\nProcess description reformulation:\\n1) Randomly permute the 21 competitors; denote the order by P1, P2, ..., P21.\\n2) Set A = P1 (initial active).\\n3) For k from 2 to 21: player Pk appears as opponent to current active A; the higher skill wins and becomes new active; the other is eliminated.\\nThis “random arrival order” process produces the same distribution of active players and eliminated players as the original tournament rule, because at each stage the chosen inactive opponent is uniformly random among those not yet seen, matching players P2,...,P21 being revealed in random order.\\nSo we can study the simpler process: a random permutation arrival, where each arriving player challenges the current active, stronger skill survives. There are 20 games, one per arrival after the first.\\nUnder this model, we want the expected number of games involving Alice (skill 11).\\nIn this arrival model, Alice appears at some random position J in {1,...,21}, with J uniform. Before position J, some other players may have become the active champion among P1,...,P_{J-1}. At step J, Alice (P_J) plays exactly one game: she challenges the current active player A_{J-1}; the higher skill survives to be A_J.\\nAfter step J, if Alice won, she may remain active or later be defeated by a stronger-arriving opponent. Each arrival from J+1 to 21 triggers a game between the current active and the new arrival.\\nHence, conditional on J and on the multiset of skills of players before and after J, Alice's total number of games is 1 (at arrival) plus the number of later arrivals she plays against while she is active.\\nWe characterize the process in terms of record maxima among the arrival sequence when looking relative to Alice's skill.\\nLet s = 11 be Alice's skill. Consider the random permutation of the 21 skills, with 11 at some position J. Define M_{k} as the maximum skill among P1,...,Pk.\\nAt Alice's arrival (k=J):\\n- She plays against M_{J-1} (since current active always equals M_{J-1}).\\n- If M_{J-1} < 11, she wins and becomes active; if M_{J-1} > 11, she loses and is eliminated, playing only that game.\\nSo Alice survives past her first game iff all earlier players have skill < 11, i.e. the maximum before her is below 11.\\nThus event S (survive arrival) is equivalent to: among the J-1 earlier positions, only skills 1–10 appear, no skills 12–21.\\nAfter she becomes active at J under S, her future opponents among positions J+1,...,21 appear in random order among the remaining 20-(J-1)-1 = 21-J players. Among these remaining players, some have skill < 11, some > 11. When a weaker (<11) appears, she wins and stays active; when a stronger (>11) appears, that stronger wins, becomes active, and Alice is eliminated (no further games for her). She plays against every later arriving player until the first one stronger than 11 appears (if any); after that, she is gone. If there is no stronger among the later arrivals, she will play against all remaining opponents and end as champion.\\nThus, conditioned on her arrival position J and on the set of remaining players, the number of games she plays after her first one equals the number of players appearing up to and including the first stronger player among the remaining stronger ones, or all if none.\\nWe can compute the expected number of games via symmetry using only counts of weaker and stronger players relative to her at each possible J.\\nTotal weaker players: 10 (skills 1–10).\\nTotal stronger players: 10 (skills 12–21).\\nFor a given permutation, when we look around Alice, the relative ordering of the weaker and stronger players is just a random interleaving.\\nLet’s compute directly using the random permutation model with relative categories: W for weaker (<11), A for Alice, S for stronger (>11). There are 10 W, 10 S, and 1 A, arranged in a uniformly random permutation of length 21.\\nAlice's games are:\\n- At her arrival, always 1 game.\\n- Plus additional games against a run of Ws and possibly one S after her first appearance, depending on whether there is any S to her right.\\nBefore her arrival, the active champion is simply the strongest among the players seen so far. Since we only care whether this champion is weaker or stronger than 11, and because all S players are stronger than all W players, the champion before Alice is S if any S is among the earlier players, otherwise W.\\nTherefore, Alice survives her first game exactly when there is no S before her, i.e. when all earlier players are W. In the W/A/S representation, this means that left of A there are only W symbols.\\nSimilarly, after her arrival, she will play:\\n- If some S appears before any W or S eliminates her? Wait: after she becomes active (which requires no S before her), the sequence to her right consists of some mix of W and S in random order. She will play each symbol to her right until the first S appears; she beats all W and then loses to the first S; or, if no S occurs to her right, she beats all W to her right and remains champion.\\nThus, her total number of games N from the permutation can be described as:\\nLet the random sequence be W^L A X_1 X_2 ... X_R, where each X_i is W or S, L ≥ 0, and R = 20 - L, with the constraint that not all of the 10 S are before A because we require the exact combinatorial distribution.\\nMore systematically, choose a random permutation of multiset {10 W, 10 S, 1 A}. Let L be the number of S appearing before A; if L ≥ 1, Alice meets a stronger active champion and loses instantly at arrival → N = 1. If L = 0, she survives arrival. Let K be the position of the first S after A (counting from 1 after A). If there is at least one S to the right, then she will play against all X_1,...,X_K (since she is active during this interval): these include some initial Ws and then a final S that eliminates her. If there is no S to the right, she plays against all R players to the right, all of which are W.\\nHowever, the first game at arrival is distinct. When L = 0, before she arrives the active champion is some W (if any W before her) or there's none (if she is first). In either case, at arrival she plays against a W champion and wins. That counts as 1 of her games.\\nAfter that, the X_1,...,X_R process to the right includes that champions' subsequent opponents only; her initial game isn't part of X_i list because it corresponds to the interaction with the previous champion. So we should express N as:\\nLet E[N] = 1 + E[additional games]. Additional games are 0 if she loses at the first game, positive otherwise. To avoid confusion, treat the process fully:\\nCase A: L ≥ 1 (there is at least one S before A). Then at arrival she plays against champion S and loses immediately. So N = 1.\\nCase B: L = 0 (no S before A). Then before A, all earlier players are W; if there's at least one W before her, the champion is W; if no one is before her, there is no champion and the first game occurs when A meets P2, but in our run-length model it's still 1 first game. In all L=0 cases she wins her first game and becomes active.\\nAfterwards, consider the sequence to her right, say it contains a_w W's and a_s S's (with a_w + a_s = R, R = 20 - (# before A)). She will then:\\n- Encounter future arrivals in order; for each W, she wins and continues; for the first S (if any), she loses and stops.\\nThus additional games equal:\\n- If a_s ≥ 1: number of players up to and including the first S among the right-side sequence, i.e. the index of first S.\\n- If a_s = 0: R (all W's to right).\\nThis is exactly the number of symbols in the run from A to the first S on the right including S if present, or to the end if no S.\\nWe can treat the W/S sequence given that L = 0 and the positions of W and S overall satisfy: total W = 10, total S = 10, A sits where no S before it. Equivalently, conditional on L = 0, all S must be to the right of A, and all W to the left or right remain symmetric subject to counts.\\nCompute probabilities using combinatorics.\\nLet position of A be j (1 ≤ j ≤ 21). The number of players before A is j-1; these must be W only to have L=0. So j-1 ≤ 10, and the number of such sequences is C(10, j-1) ways to pick which W among the 10 appear before A, since no S can appear before A. The number of ways to position A with exactly j-1 W before and remaining multiset behind is simply choose which j-1 positions among W's are before; the S's necessarily all to the right of A.\\nBut the unconditional distribution of j is uniform among 21; the internal composition of who is before/after is random with equal likelihood across all permutations of the multiset {10 W, 10 S, 1 A}.\\nBetter to compute E[N] directly as expectation over random permutation of 10 W, 10 S, 1 A, using symmetry from random permutations of colored balls:\\n1) Probability Alice meets a stronger champion at arrival.\\nAt arrival, the active champion is the maximum skill among players before A in the permutation. This champion is stronger than Alice iff at least one S appears before A (i.e. L ≥ 1). In such case N=1.\\nWe can calculate P(L=0) first: probability no S before A.\\nIn a random permutation of multiset, by symmetry we can choose positions: the event L=0 is that the first among {A} ∪ {all S} is A. There are 11 objects in this subset (A plus 10 S). In a random permutation, each is equally likely to appear first among that subset, so the probability that A is first among them is 1/11.\\nThus P(L=0) = 1/11; P(L ≥ 1) = 10/11.\\nTherefore, with probability 10/11, N=1.\\nWith probability 1/11, Alice beats a W at arrival and then continues as active while there are only W's before her and both W and S to her right.\\nNow we need E[N | L=0]. Then E[N] = (10/11)*1 + (1/11)*E[N | L=0].\\nUnder L=0 condition, the first among A and all S is A. That means all S are to the right of A. Among the 10 W and 10 S plus A, given that A is first among {A,S}, the positions of W and S relative to A satisfy: all 10 S are to the right; the 10 W split arbitrarily: some to the left, some to the right. Conditioned on A being before all S, the ordering of the 10 W and A is still random among themselves and independent of S's positions aside from the constraint.\\nWe only care about the sequence from A to the right, which consists of some number w_R of W and all 10 S (since all S are to the right). The relative order of these w_R W and 10 S to the right is uniformly random.\\nWhat is the distribution of w_R (number of W to the right of A)? Under random permutation conditioned on A before all S, the 10 W are randomly placed in the 20 positions that are not A, without constraints linked to the S besides the relative ordering of A and S. However, whether a W is left or right of A is symmetric: for each W, A is equally likely to be before or after W among those two, so probability that W is to the right of A is 1/2. Since the 10 W are exchangeable, w_R has Binomial(10, 1/2) distribution under this conditioning.\\nJustification: Consider the subsystem of {A,W1,...,W10}, ignoring S. Within this subsystem, the order is a random permutation of 11 distinct elements. Position of A among these 11 is uniform. For any fixed W, probability that W is after A is 1/2 in a random permutation. Also, the relative ordering of these 11 elements is independent of placement of S's, and the condition \\\"A is before all S\\\" doesn't involve W positions relative to A, so w_R still Binomial(10,1/2).\\nThus, given L=0, number of W to the right of A is Binomial(10,1/2), and there are always exactly 10 S to the right. The sequence to the right contains w_R W's and 10 S's in random order.\\nAlice, starting active after her arrival game, will face future arrivals in order until the first S appears. The number of additional games she plays equals the index of the first S in this random permutation of w_R W's and 10 S's.\\nGiven w_R = w, we have a random permutation of w W's and 10 S's; the first S appears at some position between 1 and w+10. The distribution of the index of first S in such a random permutation is well known: it's 1 plus the number of initial W's before any S. The number of initial W's is distributed like the length of the initial run of W's when all permutations are equally likely. The probability that the first S occurs at position k (1 ≤ k ≤ w+10) is proportional to the number of permutations where the first k-1 positions are W, and position k is S. That number equals C(w, k-1)*C(10-1,0) times (w+10-k)! etc, but simpler: Every permutation is equally likely, so the set of positions of the 10 S is a uniformly random 10-subset of the w+10 slots. The first S index is simply the minimum of these 10 positions. For a random k-subset of {1,...,n}, the expected minimum is (n+1)/(k+1). Here, n = w+10, k = 10 (number of S). So:\\nE[first S position | w_R = w] = ( (w+10) + 1 ) / (10 + 1) = (w+11)/11.\\nThus additional games (beyond the arrival game) given w_R = w and L=0 equals (w+11)/11.\\nTherefore N | (L=0, w_R = w) = 1 (arrival) + (w+11)/11.\\nWe then average over w_R ~ Binomial(10, 1/2).\\nCompute E[N | L=0]:\\nE[N | L=0] = E[ 1 + (w_R + 11)/11 ]\\n= 1 + ( E[w_R] + 11 ) / 11.\\nE[w_R] = 10 * (1/2) = 5.\\nSo E[N | L=0] = 1 + (5 + 11)/11 = 1 + 16/11 = (11/11 + 16/11) = 27/11.\\nTherefore:\\nE[N] = (10/11)*1 + (1/11)*(27/11)\\n= 10/11 + 27/121.\\nPut over common denominator 121:\\n10/11 = 110/121.\\nSo E[N] = 110/121 + 27/121 = 137/121.\\nThis is the expected number of games Alice plays.\\nThus:\\n- Problem 1 solutions: (12, 3, 4) and (6, 27/5, 38/5).\\n- Problem 2 expected number of games: 137/121.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"(12,3,4);(6,27/5,38/5)\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"137/121\"\n}",
