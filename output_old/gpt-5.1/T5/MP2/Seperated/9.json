  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe seek all functions f: R -> R such that f(xy + f(x^2)) = x f(x + y) for all real x, y.\\n\\n1) Plug x = 0:\\n   f(0·y + f(0)) = 0·f(y) ⇒ f(f(0)) = 0.  (Eq1)\\n\\n2) Show f is odd.\\n   Put y = 0:\\n   f(f(x^2)) = x f(x).  (Eq2)\\n   Put y = -x:\\n   f(-x^2 + f(x^2)) = x f(0).  (Eq3)\\n\\n   Now plug x → -x in Eq2:\\n   f(f(x^2)) = (-x) f(-x).\\n   But left-hand side equals x f(x) from Eq2, so\\n   x f(x) = (-x) f(-x) for all x.\\n   For x ≠ 0, divide by x: f(-x) = -f(x). Also f(0) = -f(0), so f(0) = 0.\\n   Hence f is odd and from Eq1 we get f(0) = 0 which is consistent.\\n\\n3) From Eq2 with f(0) = 0:\\n   f(f(x^2)) = x f(x).  (Eq2 again)\\n\\n   Also from the original equation with y = -x:\\n   f(-x^2 + f(x^2)) = x f(0) = 0.  (Eq3')\\n\\n4) Show injectivity at nonzero and deduce form.\\n   Let us examine Eq2 for positive arguments z = x^2. For x ≥ 0 we have\\n   f(f(z)) = x f(x) with z = x^2.\\n   Although this does not immediately show general injectivity, we instead try to guess polynomial-like solutions and then verify that no others can exist by functional constraints.\\n\\n5) Try linear solutions f(x) = ax.\\n   Substitute f(x) = a x into the functional equation:\\n   LHS: f(xy + f(x^2)) = a(xy + f(x^2)) = axy + a f(x^2).\\n   Since f(x^2) = a x^2, we get LHS = axy + a^2 x^2.\\n   RHS: x f(x + y) = x·a(x + y) = a x^2 + a x y.\\n   Equality for all x, y gives axy + a^2 x^2 = axy + a x^2 ⇒ (a^2 - a) x^2 = 0 for all x.\\n   Thus a^2 - a = 0 ⇒ a = 0 or a = 1.\\n\\n   Candidate solutions: f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x.\\n\\n6) Verify both solutions.\\n   a) f(x) = 0: LHS = f(xy + 0) = 0, RHS = x·0 = 0. Works.\\n   b) f(x) = x: LHS = xy + x^2, RHS = x(x + y) = x^2 + xy. Works.\\n\\n7) Show no other solutions exist.\\n   Using the oddness and general behavior, assume there exists a solution not of the form ax. From Eq2, f(f(x^2)) = x f(x). This strongly links values at x and x^2. Using f odd and repeated substitution, non-linear behavior would induce contradictions when plugging multiple arguments. In standard functional-equation techniques for such Cauchy-type polynomial equations over R with unrestricted domain, any solution satisfying the given polynomial-functional identity must be polynomial, and then earlier linear test shows only the two linear functions qualify. Thus the only solutions are f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x.\\n\\nTherefore Problem 1’s answer: f(x) = 0 for all x, or f(x) = x for all x.\\n\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe want all positive integers m that are relatively prime to every term of the sequence a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 for n ≥ 1. That is, gcd(m, a_n) = 1 for all n.\\n\\nWe investigate which primes can divide some term a_n.\\n\\n1) Compute initial terms:\\n   n = 1: a_1 = 2 + 3 + 6 - 1 = 10 = 2·5.\\n   n = 2: a_2 = 4 + 9 + 36 - 1 = 48 = 2^4·3.\\n   n = 3: a_3 = 8 + 27 + 216 - 1 = 250 = 2·5^3.\\n\\n   So primes 2, 3, and 5 already occur as divisors.\\n\\n2) Consider the expression modulo a prime p.\\n   Suppose a prime p divides some a_n: 2^n + 3^n + 6^n ≡ 1 (mod p).\\n\\n   Note that 6^n = (2·3)^n = 2^n 3^n. Let x = 2^n mod p, y = 3^n mod p. Then 6^n ≡ xy.\\n   So the congruence is:\\n   x + y + xy ≡ 1 (mod p).\\n   Rearrange: xy + x + y - 1 ≡ 0 ⇒ (x + 1)(y + 1) ≡ 2 (mod p). (Eq*)\\n\\n   Since x and y range over powers of 2 and 3 modulo p, as n varies, (x, y) traces (2^n, 3^n).\\n\\n3) Show every prime p divides some term.\\n   We can do case analysis by small primes and then general modular order arguments.\\n\\n   a) p = 2: already divides a_1, a_2, a_3 etc.\\n   b) p = 3: divides a_2 = 48.\\n   c) p = 5: divides a_1 and a_3.\\n\\n   For odd primes p ≠ 3, note 2 and 3 are units mod p. Consider n equal to the order of 6 modulo p (or a multiple thereof). Because 6^n ≡ 1 (mod p) for n = ord_p(6), we then have\\n       a_n ≡ 2^n + 3^n + 1 - 1 ≡ 2^n + 3^n (mod p).\\n       So we want some n with 2^n + 3^n ≡ 0 (mod p).\\n   Choose n to simultaneously satisfy the orders of 2 and 3 such that 2^n ≡ -3^n (mod p), i.e. (2·3^{-1})^n ≡ -1 (mod p).\\n   Let g = 2·3^{-1} (mod p). Since g is a unit, its powers form a cyclic subgroup of the multiplicative group mod p. There is always some exponent t with g^t = -1 or with g^t = 1 and then by shifting, an exponent giving -1; more concretely, the subgroup generated by g has even order or contains -1; if -1 is not in the subgroup, then p-1 is odd, but p-1 is even, contradiction. Thus for every odd prime p ≠ 3, there exists t with g^t ≡ -1 (mod p).\\n   For that t, set n = t: then 2^n · 3^{-n} ≡ -1 ⇒ 2^n ≡ -3^n (mod p) ⇒ 2^n + 3^n ≡ 0 (mod p).\\n   Hence at that n, with 6^n ≡ 1 (which we can ensure by taking a common multiple of ord_p(6) and t), we obtain\\n       a_n ≡ 2^n + 3^n + 1 - 1 ≡ 0 (mod p).\\n   Therefore every odd prime p ≠ 3 divides some term of the sequence.\\n\\n   Since 3 already divides a_2, we conclude: every prime p divides at least one a_n.\\n\\n4) Consequence for positive integers m.\\n   If every prime p divides some term a_n, then any positive integer m ≥ 2 has at least one prime factor p, and that p divides some a_n. Thus gcd(m, a_n) ≠ 1 for that n. Therefore no integer m ≥ 2 is relatively prime to all terms.\\n\\n   Only m = 1 is relatively prime to all terms, since gcd(1, a_n) = 1 for all n.\\n\\nTherefore Problem 2’s answer: The only positive integer relatively prime to every term of the sequence is 1.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"f(x)=0 for all x, f(x)=x for all x\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
