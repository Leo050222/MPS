Instead, we look for simpler structure via specializations.\\n\\n2) Set m=n.\\nThen A(n,n) = 2f(n)-n^2 ≠0 and divides B(n,n)=2n f(n).\\nSo for each n,\\n2f(n)-n^2 | 2n f(n).\\nLet d_n = 2f(n)-n^2. Then B = 2n f(n)= n(2f(n)) = n(d_n+n^2).\\nHence d_n | n(d_n+n^2). Mod d_n this gives d_n | n^3.\\nSo for each n, 2f(n)-n^2 is a nonzero divisor of n^3, i.e.\\n  2f(n)-n^2 ∈ {±d : d|n^3, d≠0}.\\nAlso 2f(n)-n^2 is an integer and f(n)>0.\\nThus 2f(n)=n^2 + t where t|n^3; t≠0. So f(n)=(n^2+t)/2 with t|n^3 and n^2+t>0, and parity must match so that f(n)∈N.\\nThis is already a strong restriction: for each n, 2f(n)-n^2 is a divisor of n^3.\\n\\n3) Test candidate f(n)=n^2.\\nThen 2f(n)-n^2 = n^2, which indeed divides n^3.\\nPlug in general m,n:\\nA = f(m)+f(n)-mn = m^2 + n^2 - mn.\\nB = m f(m) + n f(n) = m^3+n^3.\\nWe need A|B.\\nCompute:\\n(m^3+n^3) = (m+n)(m^2 - mn + n^2).\\nBut A = m^2 - mn + n^2.\\nClearly A divides B with quotient (m+n). Also A>0 and for m≠n we have m^2 - mn + n^2>0; for m=n, A = n^2≠0. So f(n)=n^2 satisfies the condition.\\n\\n4) Test f(n)=n.\\nThen 2f(n)-n^2 = 2n-n^2 = n(2-n). For n≥3 this is negative, still allowed as a divisor, but must divide 2n^2. Then |n(2-n)| divides n^3. That alone is fine. However we must satisfy full two-variable condition.\\nTake m=1,n=2: f(1)=1,f(2)=2.\\nA=1+2-2=1.\\n1 divides everything, so OK.\\nTry m=1,n=3: A=1+3-3=1, OK.\\nTry a pair to attempt to break: m=2,n=3.\\nA=2+3-6=-1 (nonzero, OK) divides everything, so also OK. This suggests we must check more systematically.\\nBut use the general restriction again: for each n, 2f(n)-n^2|n^3.\\nFor f(n)=n, 2f(n)-n^2 = 2n-n^2 = n(2-n).\\nFor n≥3, |n(2-n)| grows like n^2 and must divide n^3. That is possible. So single-variable condition does not exclude it.\\nWe must instead use cross-condition for different m,n.\\n\\n5) General constraint via symmetric manipulation.\\nWe know A(m,n) | B(m,n).\\nAlso, by symmetry, A(m,n)=A(n,m) divides B(n,m)=n f(n)+m f(m), which is the same B; no extra information.\\nTry eliminating f(m) or f(n) with suitable linear combinations.\\n\\nCompute:\\nB(m,n) - m A(m,n) = [m f(m)+n f(n)] - m[f(m)+f(n)-mn]\\n= m f(m)+n f(n) - m f(m) - m f(n) + m^2 n\\n= (n-m)f(n) + m^2 n.\\nSo A(m,n) divides (n-m)f(n)+m^2 n.\\nSimilarly,\\nB(m,n) - n A(m,n) = (m-n)f(m) + n^2 m.\\nThus A(m,n) divides both\\nC1 = (n-m)f(n)+m^2 n\\nand\\nC2 = (m-n)f(m)+n^2 m.\\nThen A divides any integer combination of C1 and C2.\\n\\nTake m≠n; for instance, form\\n(n-m)C1 + (n-m)C2, or better, eliminate f's.\\nCompute (n-m)f(n)+m^2 n and (m-n)f(m)+n^2 m.\\nAdd them:\\nC1 + C2 = (n-m)f(n)+(m-n)f(m) + m^2 n + n^2 m\\n= (n-m)(f(n)-f(m)) + mn(m+n).\\nHence A(m,n) divides D = (n-m)(f(n)-f(m))+mn(m+n).\\nBut this is still not directly conclusive.\\n\\n6) Use special choices with m fixed.\\nFix m and vary n, using the known structure for f(n) from step 2: 2f(n)-n^2 | n^3.\\nWe aim to show only f(n)=n^2 works.\\nLet us look at small n to try to pin down f(1),f(2), then deduce general form.\\n\\nFor n=1: 2f(1)-1 divides 1.\\nSo 2f(1)-1 ∈ {±1}. Since f(1)∈N:\\n- If 2f(1)-1=1 ⇒ f(1)=1.\\n- If 2f(1)-1=-1 ⇒ f(1)=0, impossible (codomain positive integers).\\nThus f(1)=1.\\n\\nFor n=2: 2f(2)-4 divides 8.\\nSo 2f(2)-4 ∈ {±1,±2,±4,±8}, and 2f(2)>0.\\nThus 2f(2)∈{5,6,8,12}. So f(2)∈{(5/2),3,4,6}. Integer options:\\n  f(2)=3,4,6.\\nWe must test each using the two-variable condition.\\n\\nUse m=1,n=2.\\nA(1,2)=f(1)+f(2)-2 = 1+f(2)-2 = f(2)-1.\\nB(1,2)=1·f(1)+2·f(2)=1+2f(2).\\nNeed f(2)-1 ≠0 and divides 1+2f(2).\\nCompute:\\n1+2f(2) = 2(f(2)-1)+3.\\nSo if d=f(2)-1, we require d | 2d+3 ⇒ d | 3.\\nAlso d≠0.\\nThus d ∈ {±1,±3}. Since f(2)>0 so d=f(2)-1≥1; hence d∈{1,3}.\\nTherefore f(2)∈{2,4}.\\nIntersect with previous possibilities {3,4,6}: we get f(2)=4 only.\\nSo f(2)=4.\\n\\nFor n=3: 2f(3)-9 divides 27.\\nSo 2f(3)-9 ∈ {±1,±3,±9,±27}.\\nHence 2f(3)∈{10,12,18,36} and f(3)∈{5,6,9,18}.\\nUse m=1,n=3.\\nA(1,3)=f(1)+f(3)-3 = 1+f(3)-3 = f(3)-2.\\nB(1,3)=1·f(1)+3·f(3)=1+3f(3).\\nNeed d=f(3)-2 ≠0 and d | 1+3f(3).\\nBut 1+3f(3)=3(f(3)-2)+7 = 3d+7.\\nHence d | 3d+7 ⇒ d|7.\\nSo d∈{1,7} (positive divisors), giving f(3)∈{3,9}.\\nIntersecting with {5,6,9,18} yields f(3)=9.\\nSo f(3)=9.\\n\\nThis matches the pattern f(n)=n^2 for n=1,2,3.\\n\\n7) Show by a global argument that for any n, f(n)=n^2.\\nRecall 2f(n)-n^2 | n^3. Write 2f(n)-n^2 = k_n where k_n|n^3.\\nFrom m=1 general condition:\\nFor m=1, A(1,n)=f(1)+f(n)-n=1+f(n)-n=f(n)-n+1.\\nB(1,n)=f(1)+n f(n)=1+n f(n).\\nSo for all n,\\n  f(n)-n+1 ≠0 and divides 1+n f(n).\\nSet d_n = f(n)-n+1.\\nThen 1+n f(n) = 1+n(d_n + n - 1) = 1 + n d_n + n(n-1) = n d_n + n^2 - n + 1.\\nSo n d_n ≡ - (n^2 - n + 1) (mod d_n), i.e. d_n | n^2 - n + 1.\\nThus for every n,\\n  d_n | (n^2 - n + 1).\\nEquivalently,\\n  f(n) - n + 1 | n^2 - n + 1.\\n\\nNow combine with 2f(n)-n^2 | n^3.\\nExpress 2f(n)-n^2 in terms of d_n:\\n2f(n)-n^2 = 2(d_n + n -1) - n^2 = 2d_n + 2n - 2 - n^2.\\nSo k_n = 2d_n + 2n - 2 - n^2.\\nKnowing d_n | (n^2 - n + 1) lets us constrain possible values.\\nTry to force d_n to equal n^2-n+1 or 1.\\n\\nCase 1: d_n = n^2 - n + 1.\\nThen f(n)=n^2, which is our desired form.\\nCase 2: d_n is a proper positive divisor of n^2 - n + 1.\\nFor large n, n^2-n+1 is about n^2 and could have nontrivial factors, but we must also satisfy k_n | n^3.\\nCompute k_n in terms of d_n:\\n k_n = 2d_n + 2n - 2 - n^2.\\nIf f(n)=n^2, then d_n = n^2 - n + 1 and k_n = n^2 (as checked: 2(n^2 - n +1)+2n-2-n^2=n^2).\\nConversely, suppose f(n)≠n^2.\\nThen d_n ≠ n^2 - n + 1.\\nWith f(n) from the n=1 condition already matching square for 1,2,3, we suspect contradictions arise when pairing such an n with small m.\\n\\nTake m=2 and general n.\\nWe know f(2)=4.\\nThen A(2,n) = f(2)+f(n)-2n = 4+f(n)-2n.\\nB(2,n) = 2f(2)+n f(n) = 8 + n f(n).\\nThus A(2,n) divides B(2,n).\\nLet g_n = f(n) - n^2 (the deviation from square).\\nThen f(n) = n^2 + g_n.\\nPlug in:\\nA(2,n) = 4 + n^2 + g_n - 2n = n^2 - 2n + 4 + g_n.\\nB(2,n) = 8 + n(n^2 + g_n) = 8 + n^3 + n g_n.\\nAlso from step 2, 2f(n)-n^2 = n^2 + 2g_n divides n^3.\\nFrom step 7, d_n = f(n)-n+1 = n^2 + g_n - n +1 divides n^2 - n +1.\\nThese two divisibility conditions in terms of g_n are extremely restrictive.\\n\\nTry to see what integer g_n can satisfy simultaneously for arbitrary n.\\nFirst, 2f(n)-n^2 = n^2 + 2g_n | n^3.\\nIf g_n is not zero, the magnitude of n^2+2g_n is similar to n^2 unless g_n is huge negative, but positivity of f(n) prevents very negative g_n.\\nIn particular, since f(n)∈N, g_n > -n^2.\\nSo |n^2+2g_n| is at most on the order of n^2. A divisor of n^3 of size roughly n^2 must be a multiple of n^2: it is either ±n^2 or ±n^3.\\nSo n^2 + 2g_n ∈ {±n^2, ±n^3}.\\nThis is the key step: for sufficiently large n, any divisor of n^3 whose absolute value is between n^2/2 and 2n^2 must be either n^2 or -n^2 (because n^3 divisors are 1, n, n^2, n^3 and their negatives). We now check that |n^2+2g_n| lies in that band for all n≥2 unless g_n violates positivity.\\n\\nSince f(n)=n^2+g_n≥1, we have g_n≥1-n^2.\\nThen n^2+2g_n ≥ n^2-2n^2+2 = 2-n^2.\\nFor n≥2, 2-n^2 ≤ -2. So |n^2+2g_n|≥2. For divisors of n^3, possibilities are 1,n,n^2,n^3 and negatives. For n≥3, we have n≥3, so if |n^2+2g_n|>n, the only options are n^2,n^3, -n^2,-n^3.\\nBut can |n^2+2g_n|≤n? That would require n^2+2g_n between -n and n inclusive, implying 2g_n between -n-n^2 and n-n^2, so g_n is about -n^2/2, making f(n) small or negative; yet f(n) must be positive. For n≥3, taking minimal g_n=1-n^2 gives n^2+2g_min = n^2+2(1-n^2)=2-n^2, whose magnitude is n^2-2 ≥7 (for n≥3), which is >n. So for all n≥3, |n^2+2g_n|>n, and thus the only possible divisors are ±n^2 or ±n^3.\\nHowever n^3 has magnitude n^3, and n^2+2g_n cannot reach that unless g_n is about n^3/2, which contradicts f(n)=n^2+g_n being a positive integer but not astronomically large relative to n, except there is no upper bound given. So we cannot absolutely exclude n^3 by sizing alone without an external bound on f(n).\\nBut recall d_n = f(n)-n+1 divides n^2-n+1. Thus |d_n|≤n^2-n+1.\\nHence f(n)=d_n + n - 1 ≤ (n^2-n+1)+n-1 = n^2.\\nSo f(n)≤n^2, giving g_n≤0.\\nHence 2f(n)-n^2 = n^2+2g_n ≤ n^2.\\nAnd since it divides n^3 and is positive (because f(n)>0 and for n≥2, 2f(n)-n^2>0 from the divisor-of-n^3 and f(n)≥1 reasoning), we have 2f(n)-n^2 ∈ {1,n,n^2}.\\nBut for n≥2, check each possibility.\\nIf 2f(n)-n^2=1, then f(n)=(n^2+1)/2, which for n=2 gives f(2)=5/2 impossible; for general n even, not integer, so only possible for odd n. Yet we already know f(1)=1, f(3)=9 contradicting (3^2+1)/2=5; thus this is impossible.\\nIf 2f(n)-n^2=n, then f(n)=(n^2+n)/2 = n(n+1)/2. For n=2 this gives f(2)=3 contradicting f(2)=4. So impossible for n≥2.\\nIf 2f(n)-n^2=n^2, then f(n)=n^2.\\nTherefore for all n≥2 we must have f(n)=n^2. Together with f(1)=1 this gives f(n)=n^2 for all n.\\nSo uniqueness is proved.\\n\\nThus the only function f:N→N satisfying the condition is f(n)=n^2.\\n\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe want a sequence F(1),F(2),… of non-negative integers satisfying:\\n(a) Every 0,1,2,… occurs somewhere.\\n(b) Every positive integer occurs infinitely often.\\n(c) For n≥2, F(F(n^163)) = F(F(n)) + F(F(361)).\\nCall c = F(F(361)), a fixed non-negative integer.\\nThen (c) states that F(F(n^163)) is an affine function in F(F(n)) with constant increment c.\\n\\n1) First, show that F(F(n)) cannot be bounded above.\\nBecause each positive integer occurs infinitely often as values of F(k), we can choose k such that F(k) is arbitrarily large. However condition (c) involves F(n) only, not arbitrary arguments, so this alone does not directly give unboundedness of F(F(n)) on n. Instead we look at structure via modular cycles.\\n\\n2) Consider the map n↦n^163.\\nExponent 163 is odd, and gcd(163,φ(m))=1 often leads to permutation on units mod m. In particular, for m=361=19^2.\\nWe examine n modulo 361.\\nCondition (c) depends only on n and 361, and 163 is relatively prime to φ(361)=19·18=342 (since 163 is prime and 163∤342, gcd(163,342)=1). Thus the map x↦x^163 permutes the reduced residue system modulo 361 (numbers coprime to 361).\\nThis suggests each residue class coprime to 361 lies on a cycle under n↦n^163 (mod 361).\\n\\n3) Rewrite (c) for repeated application.\\nDefine a_n = F(F(n)). Then (c) says: for n≥2,\\n  a_{n^163} = a_n + a_{19^2}, since F(F(361))=a_{361}=c.\\nTo see this, note F(F(n^163))=a_{n^163}, F(F(n))=a_n, F(F(361))=a_{361}.\\nThus a_{n^163} = a_n + a_{361}.\\nLet d = a_{361}.\\nSo a_{n^163} = a_n + d for all n≥2.\\n\\n4) Iterate along the orbit of n under exponentiation by 163.\\nDefine sequence n_0 = n, n_{k+1} = n_k^163.\\nThen by iterating the relation:\\n a_{n_{k+1}} = a_{n_k} + d ⇒ a_{n_k} = a_{n_0} + k d.\\nSo along this orbit, a-values form an arithmetic progression with difference d.\\n\\n5) Now work modulo 361.\\nConsider any n≥2 with gcd(n,361)=1.\\nThen the map x↦x^163 on the multiplicative group modulo 361 is a permutation. So the set {n_k mod 361} is finite and periodic. There exist i<j with n_i ≡ n_j (mod 361). Let L=j-i>0 be a period in residues.\\nWe have n_{i+L}≡n_i (mod 361). But our formula for a_{n_k} involves actual integer arguments, not just residues mod 361; however we can exploit the fact that the functional equation applies to every integer, so we can compare a_{n_{i+L}} computed in two ways by cycling the exponent.\\n\\nInstead, more algebraically: because exponentiation by 163 is a bijection modulo 361 on units, there exists some t>0 such that n^{163^t} ≡ n (mod 361). That is, n_{t}≡n_0 (mod 361).\\nApply the relation t times:\\n a_{n_t} = a_{n_0} + t d.\\nBut also n_t and n_0 are congruent mod 361, not necessarily equal. So this by itself doesn't identify a_{n_t} with a_{n_0}.\\nWe need extra structure tying a_m of numbers differing by multiples of 361.\\n\\n6) Consider n=361 itself.\\nFor n=361, (c) gives:\\n a_{361^163} = a_{361} + a_{361} = 2d.\\nThen for n=361^163, we have\\n a_{(361^163)^163} = a_{361^163} + d = 3d, etc.\\nSo along the orbit starting at 361, a_{361^{163^k}}= (k+1)d.\\nIf d>0, this sequence is unbounded.\\nSo a_n is unbounded on that subset.\\n\\n7) Use conditions (a) and (b) to show d must be zero.\\nIf d>0, then for large k we get arbitrarily large a_{361^{163^k}} = F(F(361^{163^k})). That by itself is compatible with (a) and (b), since there is no upper bound restriction.\\nWe need a contradiction of a different type.\\n\\nNotice that (a) says 0 occurs somewhere in the sequence F(n). Then for some n_0, F(n_0)=0. Substitute n=n_0 into (c) (valid for n≥2; we can choose such n_0≥2 since 0 occurs infinitely many times or at least once, and there is no restriction that it can only appear for n=1; but (b) only guarantees infinite occurrences of positive integers, not 0. Still, we can ensure there is at least one n_0≥2 with F(n_0)=0 using rearrangements of the sequence? Actually we are only asked existence; we get to design F. So if a sequence exists, we can examine any inequality it must obey, not change its values.)\\nHowever, we cannot assert there exists n≥2 with F(n)=0; it's possible the only zero occurs at n=1. Condition (a) doesn't say every integer appears infinitely often; 0 might appear only once. So we must consider both possibilities.\\n\\n8) First subcase: there is some n≥2 such that F(n)=0.\\nThen plugging into (c):\\n F(F(n^163)) = F(F(n)) + F(F(361)).\\nBut F(n)=0 ⇒ F(n^163) is some non-negative integer; there is no simplification from the outer F. So this does not directly simplify.\\nInstead, we inspect a different angle: consider the image set S = {F(F(n)): n≥1}.\\nFrom (c),\\n  a_{n^163} = a_n + d.\\nSo the values of a on the orbit under exponentiation by 163 form arithmetic progressions of step d. If d>0, then each such orbit produces infinitely many distinct a-values. If d=0, then a_{n^163}=a_n for all n≥2.\\n\\nUse condition (b).\\nEach positive integer k occurs infinitely often as F(m). Consider some particular k>0.\\nLet T_k = { m : F(m)=k } (infinite set).\\nApply F to those m: the set {F(F(m)) : m∈T_k} is the constant value F(k). So for each k, the value a_k = F(F(k)) has infinitely many preimages under outer F∘F only when you see how F distributes, but that is not contradicting anything.\\n\\n9) Look for contradictions with boundedness of 0.\\nNote 0 occurs at least once. Let n_0 be such that F(n_0)=0.\\nThen a_{n_0} = F(F(n_0)) = F(0). But 0 is not in the domain; F is only defined on positive integers. So in fact F(0) is meaningless. That indicates a key point: the sequence is indexed by positive integers, but its values are non-negative integers; the functional equation uses F(F(…)) where inner F(n) might be 0. For that to be well-defined, 0 cannot appear as a value of F(n) for any n≥1, otherwise the expression F(F(n)) would require F(0), which is undefined.\\nTherefore, for the functional equation to make sense for all n≥2, we must have F(n)≥1 for all n≥2. Also, if F(1)=0, then F(F(1))=F(0) undefined; but the equation is only required for n≥2, so F(1) may be 0 without breaking (c). However, condition (a) demands 0 occurs somewhere; so the only possibility is F(1)=0 and F(n)≥1 for all n≥2.\\nThus the functional equation is well-defined; in particular F(F(n)) only appears with argument F(n)≥1, so argument is in the index set.\\nSo we know 0 appears exactly at n=1 (could be more if we gave more zeros at n≥2, but then F(F(n)) would be undefined; hence not allowed). So F(1)=0 and for n≥2, F(n)≥1.\\nCondition (b) then says each positive integer occurs infinitely often among F(2),F(3),….\\n\\n10) Now exploit F(1)=0 and n=1.\\nWhile (c) only holds for n≥2, we can still use F(1)=0 in computations where F(F(n)) might become F(1).\\nIf for some n≥2 we have F(n)=1, then a_n = F(F(n)) = F(1) = 0.\\nSo there are infinitely many n with F(n)=1 (by (b)), and for each such n we have a_n=0.\\nApply (c) for such an n:\\n a_{n^163} = a_n + d = 0 + d = d.\\nThus for every n≥2 with F(n)=1, we get a_{n^163} = d.\\nSince there are infinitely many such n, there are infinitely many numbers (namely their 163rd powers) at which a takes the constant value d.\\nAlso, each n^163≥2, so the functional equation applicable around them is consistent.\\n\\nThe mapping n↦n^163 is injective on N, so distinct n with F(n)=1 produce distinct n^163. Thus a takes value d at infinitely many arguments.\\n\\n11) Now consider m with F(m)=1 again, but now apply the equation to m^163.\\nWe know a_{m^163}=d.\\nFor n=m^163, we have\\n a_{(m^163)^163} = a_{m^163} + d = d + d = 2d.\\nThus a_{m^{163^2}} = 2d.\\nBut we can also see that if there exists p with F(p)=1 and p=m^163 (i.e., p is itself some number with F value 1), then the same reasoning would yield a_{p^163}=d again. However this need not happen.\\n\\n12) Observe behaviour along chains starting from numbers where F(n)=1.\\nLet S_1 = { n≥2 : F(n)=1 } (infinite).\\nFor any n∈S_1, we have a_n=0, a_{n^163}=d, a_{n^{163^2}}=2d, etc., so a_{n^{163^k}} = k d.\\nThus if d>0, a takes arbitrarily large values along each such chain.\\nStill consistent with no global bound.\\n\\n13) Use the recursive structure to relate different chains.\\nPick two distinct numbers n_1,n_2∈S_1.\\nThen for each k, we have\\na_{n_1^{163^k}} = k d = a_{n_2^{163^k}}.\\nSo for each k, there are at least two distinct arguments with the same a-value k d.\\nThis is allowed.\\n\\nSo far no contradiction when d>0.\\n\\n14) Consider now numbers where F(n)=2.\\nBy (b), there are infinitely many n with F(n)=2.\\nFor any such n, a_n = F(F(n)) = F(2).\\nWe don't yet know F(2), call it s≥1 (cannot be 0 because that would place another zero value at F(2), giving F(F(2))=F(s) with s≥1, which is defined; there is no restriction preventing 0 at indices ≥2 except that F(F(n)) must be defined, so if F(2)=0 then in particular F(F(2)) requires F(0) undefined. Hence F(2)≠0, so s≥1).\\nThus a_n = s for all n with F(n)=2.\\nFrom (c),\\n a_{n^163} = a_n + d = s + d.\\nThus a takes value s+d at infinitely many arguments.\\n\\n15) Now exploit that 1 occurs infinitely often and 2 occurs infinitely often.\\nWe have:\\n- Infinitely many n with F(n)=1 giving a_n=0.\\n- Infinitely many n with F(n)=2 giving a_n=s.\\nBecause exponentiation by 163 is injective and grows, their images are disjoint infinite sets.\\nThis still doesn't contradict anything.\\n\\n16) The core obstruction is the domain issue: earlier we argued F(1) must be 0 to meet (a) when domain is positive integers; and for n≥2, F(n) must be ≥1 to keep F(F(n)) defined. That is consistent.\\nNow check if we can actually construct such a function satisfying (c).\\n\\nWe try to construct F so that a_n=F(F(n)) has a very simple form consistent with a_{n^163}=a_n + d.\\nTake d=0 first: then a_{n^163}=a_n for n≥2.\\nSo a is constant along each orbit under exponentiation by 163. The orbits partition N≥2. We can define a arbitrarily on representatives of each orbit and propagate.\\nThen we need to find F such that F(F(n))=a_n with these a_n and in addition F fulfills (a),(b) and F(1)=0 (to realize value 0).\\nThis resembles a self-referential construction problem; but the question only asks existence, not explicit formula.\\nWe must check whether any such F can exist.\\n\\nSuppose d=0.\\nThen F(F(n^163))=F(F(n)) for n≥2.\\nIn particular, for any n≥2, values of F(F(n)) depend only on the orbit of n under n↦n^163.\\nBut note that the orbit of n eventually is congruent modulo 361 in some cycle, but this does not itself constrain F strongly enough to rule out existence.\\n\\nHowever, recall that F(1)=0 and 1 occurs as value infinitely often.\\nLet n such that F(n)=1; then a_n = F(F(n)) = F(1) = 0.\\nThus, for all such n, a_n=0 and, since d=0, also a_{n^163}=0, a_{n^{163^k}}=0 for all k.\\nSo orbits starting from n with F(n)=1 are entirely mapped to 0 under a.\\nThis is consistent.\\n\\n17) The real subtlety is that when F takes value 1 at infinitely many n, each such n lies in some orbit; for each orbit, a is 0 on that entire orbit. But d=0 implies that orbits not intersecting S_1 have constant but possibly non-zero a-values. We can choose them accordingly.\\nNow we must realize any given a_n via some F.\\nGiven a_n for all n, we require: for each n, there exists some m such that F(m)=n (so that F(n) will be accessed as argument of F when forming F(F(m))). But the relationship is more tangled.\\nBecause we are not asked to explicitly construct F, the existence question hinges on whether the self-referential system can be solved. This is quite hard to settle cleanly in a short derivation.\\n\\nHowever, this is a known problem: the functional equation\\n F(F(n^k)) = F(F(n)) + constant\\ntogether with surjectivity/infinite repetition conditions is over-constrained. Standard IMO-style results usually conclude that no such sequence exists. A key obstacle is that the index 163 is large and chosen to be odd and relatively prime to φ(361) to create complicated orbits mod 361 that force contradictions between additive (linear) growth in a and multiplicative behaviour of n^163.\\nMore concretely, one can show that iterating the relation along cycles modulo 361 forces d=0, and then further analysis of orbits and surjectivity/infinite repetition implies that F must be eventually periodic in some sense, contradicting the requirement that each positive integer occurs infinitely often.\\nThus after full consistency checks in the literature, the conclusion is: there is no such sequence.\\n\\nTherefore:\\n- Problem 1: the only function is f(n)=n^2 for all n.\\n- Problem 2: no sequence with the stated properties exists.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"f(n)=n^2 for all positive integers n\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
