FemtoPravis is walking on an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard that wraps around at its edges (so squares on the left edge of the chessboard are adjacent to squares on the right edge, and similarly for the top and bottom edges). Each femtosecond, FemtoPravis moves in one of the four diagonal directions uniformly at random. After $n$ femtoseconds, what is the probability that FemtoPravis is at his original location?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n  \"reasoning\": \"We first solve the prime equation. We need primes p, q, r such that p/q − 4/(r+1) = 1, and are told to identify r so that r+1 is the denominator of the subtracted fraction. Rearranging: p/q − 1 = 4/(r+1) ⇒ (p−q)/q = 4/(r+1). For primes q and r, this becomes (p−q)(r+1) = 4q. Since q is prime and must divide the left side, either q divides (p−q) or q divides (r+1). If q divides (p−q), then q divides p and since p is prime we get p=q; then p−q=0 so left side is 0, impossible because 4q>0. So instead q must divide (r+1). But r is prime, so r+1 is not a multiple of r. The only way for a prime q to divide r+1 and also appear in 4q is if r+1 is one of the divisors of 4q. Since r+1 is composite (r>2 to be odd, but if r=2 then r+1=3 not dividing 4q nicely), we inspect possibilities via factoring the Diophantine equation: (p−q)(r+1)=4q. Since p is prime and >0, p−q>0, so p>q. Then p−q must be a positive divisor of 4q. Try the small divisors, systematically. Let d = p−q, then r+1 = 4q/d. We need r+1 integer and r prime. For q odd prime, 4q/d even; r+1 must be even, so 4q/d even; possible. Try d=1: r+1=4q, so r=4q−1. But then q divides r+1=4q, impossible since r+1 is exactly 4q, and then r=4q−1 is composite except maybe small cases; but we need r prime. Plug small q: q=2 ⇒ r=7, check p=q+d=3, test original: 3/2−4/8=3/2−1/2=1 works. So p=3,q=2,r=7 is a valid triple. For q=3 ⇒ r=11, p=4 not prime. For q=5 ⇒ r=19, p=6 not prime; larger q makes p nonprime. Try other divisors: d=2 ⇒ r+1=2q. Then r=2q−1. For q=2, r=3, p=4 not prime. For q=3, r=5, p=5 prime, check: 5/3−4/6=5/3−2/3=1 works. So p=5,q=3,r=5 is another valid triple. For q>3, r=2q−1 will generally be odd but usually composite; checking q=5 gives r=9 composite, etc. d=4 ⇒ r+1=q, so r=q−1 not prime for q>3; the case q=3 gives r=2 but then p=q+d=7 and check: 7/3−4/3=1 works too. However in this case r+1=3, so the r in the fraction denominator is 2 (since r+1=3). The problem states: “r is the prime number such that r+1 equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term.” That is a bit oddly worded, but the subtracted fraction is 4/(r+1); “numerator” must be 4. To interpret the intent: they likely mean specifically the r appearing in 4/(r+1), not any other representation. The equation originally has exactly one r, so r is fixed by that fraction. Among the found solutions, the ones consistent with the original equation are (p,q,r)=(3,2,7) and (5,3,5); also (7,3,2) works but there r=2 gives r+1=3 in the denominator. All satisfy the same equation. We are told not to find all triples, but simply compute n = r + 2009, “where r is the prime number such that r + 1 equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term.” The intent is ambiguous, but given the equation form 4/(r+1), r+1 is the denominator; they might have a typo saying “numerator”, but they clearly tie r+1 to that fraction. The natural reading: use the r from 4/(r+1) in any solution of the equation. We need to select the r that works with primes p and q. The smallest r among the valid triples is r=2 (from (7,3,2)), then r=5, then r=7. The problem likely expects the smallest such r because they do not specify multiple answers or a set; standard contest style is to take the smallest positive solution. Thus choose r=2. Then n = r + 2009 = 2011. Now for the random walk: FemtoPravis moves on an 8×8 toroidal chessboard. Each move is one of four diagonal moves: (±1,±1) in coordinates modulo 8. After n femtoseconds (n steps), we want the probability of being back at the origin. On the torus, the walk factors into independent motions in x and y coordinates: each step adds +1 or −1 independently in each coordinate, but with correlation between x and y signs because the four moves are (1,1),(1,−1),(−1,1),(-1,−1), each with probability 1/4. Let X_k, Y_k be the x and y coordinates after k steps. Then X_k = sum of k increments each ±1, with each sign equally likely when marginalizing over the four choices. Indeed P(Δx=1) = P(NE or SE)=1/2, P(Δx=−1)=1/2, similarly for Δy, and signs across steps are independent. The correlation between Δx and Δy within a step does not affect the marginal distribution of X_k and Y_k separately, but it can affect joint distribution. However, being at origin requires X_n ≡0 mod 8 and Y_n ≡0 mod 8 simultaneously. Due to symmetry across the 4 diagonal directions, positions are uniform over the subset of squares of the same color parity that are reachable after n steps’ parity, but we can instead use Fourier or step-parity analysis. Observe: each move changes both coordinates by ±1, so the parity of x and y each flip every step. Starting at (0,0) with even-even, after one step we are odd-odd; after two steps even-even, etc. Thus to return to (0,0), n must be even. Our n=2011 is odd, so probability to be exactly at the starting square is 0. The wrap-around does not change this parity fact because coordinates are modulo 8, but parity is modulo 2; adding ±1 per step flips parity regardless of modulo 8 wrap. After an odd number of steps, we are on a black square if we started on white, never the original. Therefore the probability is 0.\",\n  \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
