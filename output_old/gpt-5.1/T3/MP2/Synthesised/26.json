  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"1) Let OA be the common distance from the tetrahedron’s circumcenter O to vertex A. Given AB=AC=AD=2, these three points lie on a circle of radius 2 centered at A in space, so O lies on the line through A along the normal to plane BCD. Let h = AX be the altitude from A to face BCD, and R the circumradius of the tetrahedron. Then O is on line AX, at some distance z from the plane BCD, so AO^2 = (h − z)^2 + z^2 = R^2. But AB^2 = AC^2 = AD^2 = 2^2 = 4 also equals OA^2 + OB^2 − 2·OA·OB·cos∠AOB, and since O is circumcenter, OA=OB=OC=OD=R and AB = AC = AD = 2. However, we do not actually need R itself—only h.\\n2) Use the volume and face area relation: Volume V of tetrahedron = (1/3)(area of base BCD)·AX. Here V=1, so area(BCD) = 3/h. Let edges of triangle BCD be a=BC, b=CD, c=DB, with abc=16 and Δ = area(BCD) =3/h. By Heron’s formula, Δ^2 = s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c) where s=(a+b+c)/2. However, with only the product abc and Δ, we still seem one equation short. The missing relation comes from the fact that A, B, C, D all share the same circumradius. 3) For a tetrahedron with one vertex A at equal distance p from three others B,C,D (i.e., AB=AC=AD=p) and base BCD with side lengths a,b,c and area Δ, there is a known formula relating p, Δ, a,b,c, and the circumsphere. One can embed the base BCD in a plane and place A along the perpendicular. Let R be circumradius. We have R^2 = OA^2 = OB^2 etc. Consider the circumcircle of triangle BCD: let its circumradius be R_b. Then if O is distance z from plane BCD, we have R^2 = z^2 + R_b^2. Also, A is offset from O by vector along same perpendicular: if plane BCD is at 0, O at z, A at h, then AO^2 = (h−z)^2. But also AO^2=R^2, so (h−z)^2 = z^2 + R_b^2. Hence h^2 -2hz + z^2 = z^2 + R_b^2, so h^2 - 2hz = R_b^2, hence z = (h^2 − R_b^2)/(2h). Notably, R_b is determined by triangle BCD: 16R_b^2 = (abc)^2 / (Δ^2) (since ABC area = abc/(4R_b)). Here abc=16 and Δ=3/h, so Δ^2=9/h^2, and abc/(4R_b)=Δ gives R_b = abc/(4Δ) = 16/(4·(3/h))=16h/12=4h/3, so R_b^2 = 16h^2/9. 4) Plug R_b^2 into relation for z: z = (h^2 − 16h^2/9)/(2h) = ( (9h^2−16h^2)/9 )/(2h) = (−7h^2/9)/(2h)= −7h/18. Then R^2 = z^2 + R_b^2 = (49h^2/324) + (16h^2/9) = h^2(49/324 + 16·36/324) = h^2(49/324 + 576/324)= h^2·625/324, so R = (25/18)h. But we also know AB=2 is the chord of the sphere corresponding to some central angle. However, we can write AB in terms of p=2 and h. Rather, use that A,B,C,D share circumradius R: the circumradius of triangle ABC can be computed in terms of sides: AB=AC=2 and BC=a. Then circumradius of triangle ABC is R as well. Using formula R = a/(2sin∠A), but we can instead use the standard formula: for triangle with sides u,v,w, circumradius R = uvw/(4Δ_ABC). In triangle ABC, sides: AB=AC=2, BC=a. Its area Δ_ABC can also be expressed via the altitude from A relative to BC. But we don’t know a individually. Same happens with ABD and ACD. However, we have one more relation: base BCD is arbitrary up to abc and area so far, but the fact that AB=AC=AD=2 imposes a constraint that pins abc and Δ, and we leveraged that to express R in terms of h. Now relate this R and p with geometry from A to triangle BCD. Another way: consider the distance from A to each of B,C,D. If base BCD lies in z=0, and A at (0,0,h) in some coordinates, and B,C,D in that plane, we have |AB|^2 = |A−B|^2 = h^2 + |B|^2 = 4, similarly h^2 + |C|^2 = 4, h^2 + |D|^2 = 4. So B,C,D lie on a circle of radius sqrt(4−h^2) in their plane. Hence the circumradius of triangle BCD, call it ρ, equals sqrt(4−h^2). But we previously called the circumradius of triangle BCD as R_b, and by perpendicular symmetry, that circumcircle center is projection of A onto the plane, not the circumcenter of tetrahedron; but in fact, since AB=AC=AD, the circle through B,C,D with center at projection of A has radius sqrt(4−h^2). For B,C,D to have that circumcenter, triangle BCD must be isosceles in special ways; instead, the actual circumcenter of triangle BCD can be offset. However, because AB=AC=AD, the locus of points equidistant from B,C,D is a line perpendicular to their plane; A lies on it only if that equidistance equals the circumradius of triangle BCD. But given AB=AC=AD, A is equidistant from B,C,D, so projection of A must be circumcenter of BCD. Therefore that circle radius must be sqrt(4−h^2) and equals R_b.\\n5) Thus we have R_b^2 = 4−h^2 and also from step 3, R_b^2 = 16h^2/9. So 4−h^2 = 16h^2/9, i.e., 4 = h^2 + 16h^2/9 = (25/9)h^2, so h^2 = 36/25, hence h = 6/5 (positive). Then volume V = (1/3)Δh = 1 gives Δ = 3/h = 3/(6/5)= (3·5)/6=5/2, and abc =16 consistent with earlier R_b. Now δ = AX − 7/10 = h − 7/10 = 6/5 − 7/10 = 12/10 −7/10=5/10=1/2. 6) In the coordinate plane, triangle ABC has vertices A=(0,0), B=(200,100), C=(30,330). We want the number of integer pairs (x,y) such that (x+δ, y+δ) is interior to triangle ABC. Since δ=1/2, this is equivalent to counting integer points (u,v) in the interior of triangle A'B'C' where A'=A−(δ,δ)=(−1/2,−1/2), B'=(199.5,99.5), C'=(29.5,329.5), with u=x+δ, v=y+δ integers. So we are counting integer lattice points in the interior of triangle A'B'C'. The coordinates of A',B',C' are each (original) minus (1/2,1/2), so this triangle is just original ABC shifted by (−1/2,−1/2). A translation by a half unit in both directions bijects integer points inside with half-integer points inside original, but more simply, the number of interior lattice points of a polygon is invariant under translation. So the number of integer points interior to A'B'C' equals the number of integer points interior to ABC. We compute that via Pick’s Theorem: For lattice polygon, Area = I + B/2 −1, where I is number of interior integer points and B is number of lattice points on boundary. 7) First compute area of triangle ABC: use determinant formula: Area = |x1(y2−y3)+x2(y3−y1)+x3(y1−y2)|/2. With A=(0,0), B=(200,100), C=(30,330): area = |0*(100−330) + 200*(330−0) + 30*(0−100)|/2 = |0 + 200*330 +30*(−100)|/2 = |66000 −3000|/2=63000/2=31500. 8) Compute B, the number of lattice points on boundary of triangle ABC. For each segment, the number of lattice points on the segment including endpoints is gcd(|Δx|,|Δy|)+1; the total boundary points B = sum over edges of these minus 3 (to not double-count vertices). For AB: Δx=200−0=200, Δy=100−0=100, so gcd(200,100)=100, points on AB:100+1=101. For BC: Δx=30−200= −170, Δy=330−100=230, gcd(170,230)=10 (since gcd(17,23)=1), so points on BC:10+1=11. For CA: Δx=0−30= −30, Δy=0−330= −330, gcd(30,330)=30, so points on CA:30+1=31. Sum =101+11+31=143. Subtract 3 (each vertex counted twice) to get B=143−3=140. 9) Use Pick: Area = I + B/2 −1, so 31500 = I + 140/2 −1 = I +70 −1 = I +69. Thus I=31500−69=31431. So there are 31431 integer points in the interior of triangle ABC and thus 31431 ordered pairs (x,y) such that (x+δ,y+δ) lies in the interior. 10) Final answer is 31431.\",\n    \"answer\": \"31431\"\n}",
