  "math_problem": "Let $Q(x)=x^{2}+2x+3$, and suppose that $P(x)$ is a polynomial such that $P(Q(x))=x^{6}+6x^{5}+18x^{4}+32x^{3}+35x^{2}+22x+8$. Compute $P(2)$. Instead of computing $P(2)$, simply find $k = Q(r) - 1$, where $r$ is the unique real root of the derivative of $Q$. Does there exist an irrational number $\\alpha>k$ such that $\\left\\lfloor\\alpha^{n}\\right\\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod 2017)$ for all integers $n \\geq k$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, analyze Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3. Its derivative is Q'(x) = 2x + 2, which has a unique real root at r = -1. Then Q(r) = Q(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2, so k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\\n\\nNow we ask: Does there exist an irrational number α > k = 1 such that floor(α^n) ≡ 0 (mod 2017) for all integers n ≥ k = 1? Equivalently, for all n ≥ 1, we want 2017 | floor(α^n).\\n\\nLet α > 1 be irrational. Consider the sequence of integer parts: a_n = floor(α^n). The condition requires a_n to be multiples of 2017 for all n ≥ 1.\\n\\nWrite α^n = a_n + f_n, where a_n ∈ ℤ and 0 ≤ f_n < 1 is the fractional part. The condition says a_n = 2017·m_n for some integer m_n for each n ≥ 1.\\n\\nObserve the ratio:\\nα = α^{n+1}/α^n = (a_{n+1} + f_{n+1})/(a_n + f_n).\\nSince a_n → ∞ as n grows (because α > 1), we have f_n / a_n → 0. Thus (a_{n+1} + f_{n+1}) / (a_n + f_n) differs from a_{n+1}/a_n by a vanishing amount, so α is the limit of the ratios a_{n+1}/a_n:\\nα = lim_{n→∞} a_{n+1}/a_n.\\n\\nBut each a_n is a multiple of 2017: a_n = 2017·m_n. Therefore,\\na_{n+1}/a_n = (2017·m_{n+1})/(2017·m_n) = m_{n+1}/m_n,\\nwhich is a ratio of integers. Since m_n grows unbounded (because a_n and thus α^n grow), we get a sequence of rational numbers m_{n+1}/m_n converging to α.\\n\\nThis does not itself contradict α being irrational; irrational numbers can be limits of rational sequences. So we need a sharper argument.\\n\\nInstead, examine α^n/2017. We have:\\nα^n = 2017·m_n + f_n, with 0 ≤ f_n < 1.\\nThen α^n/2017 = m_n + f_n/2017. Its fractional part is f_n/2017, which lies in [0, 1/2017).\\n\\nThus for every n ≥ 1, the fractional part {α^n/2017} ∈ [0, 1/2017). If α were irrational, then α/2017 is also irrational. For an irrational β > 1, the sequence {β^n} is dense in [0,1] modulo 1 (this follows from standard results in equidistribution theory for powers of multiplicatively independent reals, and in particular from the fact that log β / (2π) is irrational, yielding dense fractional parts). That implies {β^n} cannot be confined to a subinterval of [0,1] of length < 1. Here β = α, so {α^n/2017} cannot always be in an interval of length 1/2017.\\n\\nMore concretely, using contradiction: Assume α is irrational and floor(α^n) is always a multiple of 2017. Then all fractional parts {α^n/2017} lie in [0,1/2017). The closure of the set of these fractional parts is contained in that small interval. But for irrational α > 1, the set {α^n mod 1} is infinite and has limit points throughout [0,1]; in particular, it cannot be confined to such a small segment without being eventually periodic modulo 1, which would imply α is algebraic of a special restricted type leading to rational powers or roots of unity relations, contradicting generic irrationality. The only way for powers to have such constrained fractional parts indefinitely is for α to be a rational algebraic number with special structure, not an irrational.\\n\\nThus, no irrational α > 1 can satisfy that floor(α^n) is always divisible by 2017 for all n ≥ 1. Since k = 1, the answer to the existence question is no.\",\n    \"answer\": \"No\"\n}",
