  "math_problem": "Let $S(n)$ be the sum of the digits of the positive integer $n$. Find all $n$ such that $S(n)(S(n)-1)=n-1$. Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ satisfying the given condition, simply find $k = S(n) + 4$, where $n$ is the smallest such positive integer. Penta chooses $k$ of the vertices of a unit cube. What is the maximum possible volume of the figure whose vertices are the $k$ chosen points?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We need n such that S(n)(S(n)−1)=n−1. Let s=S(n). Then n=s(s−1)+1. But n is a positive integer whose digit sum is s, so we must have S(s(s−1)+1)=s. We search for the smallest s. Try small s: s=1 ⇒ n=1, S(1)=1 works. So the smallest n is 1, with S(n)=1. Then k=S(n)+4=5.\\nNow Penta chooses k=5 vertices of a unit cube. We must maximize the volume of the convex hull of these 5 vertices. The full cube has volume 1. With only 5 vertices we cannot get full volume, but we try to maximize.\\nKey idea: Pick 4 vertices forming a tetrahedron of maximum volume, and the 5th vertex should lie so the convex hull becomes as large as possible. The maximum-volume tetrahedron in a unit cube uses 4 vertices of a regular simplex embedded in the cube, e.g. (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1). Its volume is |det([v1−v0,v2−v0,v3−v0])|/6. Take v0=(0,0,0), v1=(1,1,0), v2=(1,0,1), v3=(0,1,1). The matrix is [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1]]. Determinant: 1*(0*1−1*1) −1*(1*1−0*0)+0*(...)=1*(−1) −1*(1)=−1−1=−2. Absolute value 2, so volume=2/6=1/3.\\nWe must see if 5 vertices can exceed this. Consider 5 vertices consisting of that regular tetrahedron plus one more vertex. For each possible 5th cube vertex, compute the additional volume of the convex hull. The convex hull is a polytope; the extra volume beyond the base tetrahedron equals the volume of pyramids formed over the visible faces from the new point.\\nTry adding (1,1,1). The original tetrahedron T has vertices A=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1). Add E=(1,1,1). Determine which faces of T are visible from E. Compute oriented volume signs: Volume of tetrahedron (A,B,C,E) uses vectors B−A=(1,1,0), C−A=(1,0,1), E−A=(1,1,1). Determinant of [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]: 1*(0*1−1*1) −1*(1*1−0*1)+0*(...)=1*(−1) −1*(1)=−2, so volume 2/6=1/3. Similar computations show several such pyramids of volume 1/6 or 1/3. However, overlapping volumes must be excluded. Rather than brute-force all, use a more geometric argument.\\nConsider the convex hull of vertices (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1). This polytope lies inside the cube and includes the entire region near the upper corner. A known result (or by decomposing the cube) is that removing the three corner tetrahedra at (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1), each of volume 1/6 with a certain base, leaves a polytope of volume 2/3. But our set does not include all vertices needed to cut out exactly those tetrahedra. So check via partitioning: The cube can be partitioned into that base tetrahedron (A,B,C,D) of volume 1/3 plus the tetrahedron (B,C,D,E). Compute volume of (B,C,D,E): vectors C−B=(0,−1,1), D−B=(−1,0,1), E−B=(0,0,1). Determinant of [[0,−1,1],[−1,0,1],[0,0,1]] is 0*(0*1−1*0) −(−1)*(−1*1−1*0)+1*(−1*0−0*0)=0 −(−1)*(−1)+0=−1. Absolute value 1 gives volume 1/6. So T(B,C,D,E) has volume 1/6. Check if these two tetrahedra share only face B,C,D and are otherwise disjoint; if so, total volume of their union is 1/3+1/6=1/2. Adding further disjoint pieces is impossible with only 5 vertices because any new pyramid would use E and some face and either overlap or lie outside the cube. Thus convex hull volume with these 5 vertices is 1/2.\\nWe still must verify that 1/2 is reachable and maximal. The previous decomposition shows the convex hull of {A,B,C,D,E} has volume at least 1/2. No 5-vertex subset can exceed 1, and known extremal configurations in the cube with 5 vertices give maximal volume 1/2, attained by precisely such a set: the 4 regular-simplex vertices plus the far corner. Any configuration missing one of these or including a closer vertex leads to a smaller hull.\\nTherefore the maximum possible volume is 1/2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/2\"\n}",
