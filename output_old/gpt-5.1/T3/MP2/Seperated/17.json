A standard Fibonacci identity is\\nS_k = F_{k+2} - 1.\\nWe first derive a formula for a single sum of F_{i+j}:\\nT_j = sum_{i=0}^{100} F_{i+j}.\\nSet n = i + j. Then i runs 0..100 ⇒ n runs j..j+100. Thus\\nT_j = sum_{n=j}^{j+100} F_n = S_{j+100} - S_{j-1}.\\nUsing S_m = F_{m+2} - 1, we get\\nT_j = (F_{j+102} - 1) - (F_{j+1} - 1) = F_{j+102} - F_{j+1}.\\nBy the Fibonacci addition identity,\\nF_{j+102} - F_{j+1} = F_{(j+1)+101} - F_{j+1}.\\nUsing F_{k+m} = F_{k}F_{m+1} + F_{k-1}F_m with k = j+1, m = 101,\\nF_{j+1+101} = F_{j+1}F_{102} + F_{j}F_{101}.\\nSo\\nF_{j+102} - F_{j+1} = F_{j+1}(F_{102}-1) + F_{j}F_{101}.\\nHowever, for our multiple sums we don't actually need the closed form in terms of j; it's enough to repeatedly apply the single-sum transform. Observe that the expression for S is symmetric in i1,...,i5, so we can sum over one index at a time.\\nDefine\\nG(i2,i3,i4,i5) = sum_{i1=0}^{100} F_{i1 + i2 + i3 + i4 + i5}.\\nFor any fixed i2,i3,i4,i5, the index in the Fibonacci term is i1 + K where K = i2 + i3 + i4 + i5. Thus\\nG(i2,i3,i4,i5) = sum_{i1=0}^{100} F_{i1 + K} = F_{K+102} - F_{K+1}.\\nNow S = sum_{i2=0}^{100} sum_{i3=0}^{100} sum_{i4=0}^{100} sum_{i5=0}^{100} [F_{(i2+i3+i4+i5)+102} - F_{(i2+i3+i4+i5)+1}].\\nApply the same reasoning to the quadruple sum in exactly the same way: for any nonnegative integer m,\\nH(m) = sum over all 4 indices from 0 to 100 of F_{(i2+i3+i4+i5)+m}\\ncan be converted by summing over, say, i2:\\nH(m) = sum_{i3,i4,i5} [sum_{i2=0}^{100} F_{i2 + (i3+i4+i5) + m}] = sum_{i3,i4,i5} [F_{(i3+i4+i5)+m+102} - F_{(i3+i4+i5)+m+1}].\\nSo each time we sum over one index that ranges from 0 to 100, the effect on an inner expression of the form F_{L} (where L is linear in the remaining indices) is to replace it by F_{L+102} - F_{L+1}. This operation is linear, so if at some stage we have a linear combination of shifted Fibonacci numbers, repeated summing over each remaining index just repeatedly applies the transform\\nT: F_n -> F_{n+102} - F_{n+1}.\\nWe start with a single Fibonacci term. Initially, when no sums have been taken, we have F_{i1+i2+i3+i4+i5}. Summing over i1 applies T once. Summing over i2 applies T again to each F-term, and so on.\\nThus after summing over all 5 independent indices (each from 0 to 100), we have applied T five times to F_n. In operator notation, the final S is:\\nS = T^5(F_0), because if all indices are 0 then the base index is 0, and each summation transforms F_n by T.\\nCheck this viewpoint more concretely:\\n- After summing over i1 (with the other indices frozen), expression in terms of base index B = i2+i3+i4+i5 is T(F_B) = F_{B+102} - F_{B+1}.\\n- After summing over i2, we apply T to each F-term in the B-expression (now B = i3+i4+i5). This yields T^2(F_{i3+i4+i5}).\\n- Repeating for i3,i4,i5 gives T^5(F_0) when all remaining indices are summed out.\\nTherefore, we need a closed form for T^5(F_n) in terms of integer combinations of shifted Fibonacci numbers.\\nWe now analyze the linear operator T on sequences a_n where a_n = F_n:\\nT(F_n) = F_{n+102} - F_{n+1}.\\nBecause Fibonacci sequences are closed under shifts and linear combinations, repeated applications of T will still be expressible as linear combinations of shifted F's. Notice that T is of the form\\nT = (shift by 102) - (shift by 1).\\nApplying T twice:\\nT^2(F_n) = T(F_{n+102} - F_{n+1}) = (F_{n+204} - F_{n+103}) - (F_{n+103} - F_{n+2}) = F_{n+204} - 2F_{n+103} + F_{n+2}.\\nWe see a binomial pattern, because T = A - B where A is shift by 102, B is shift by 1, and A and B commute (both are just index shifts). So by the binomial theorem,\\nT^k = (A - B)^k = sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j C(k,j) A^{k-j} B^{j}.\\nApplied to F_n:\\nA^{k-j}B^{j}(F_n) = F_{n + 102(k-j) + j} = F_{n + 102k - 101j}.\\nTherefore\\nT^k(F_n) = sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j C(k,j) F_{n + 102k - 101j}.\\nWe need k = 5 and n = 0:\\nT^5(F_0) = sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^j C(5,j) F_{102*5 - 101j}.\\nCompute 102*5 = 510. So the indices are 510 - 101j:\\n- j=0: index 510, coeff C(5,0) = 1, sign (+): +F_{510}.\\n- j=1: index 409, coeff 5, sign (-): -5F_{409}.\\n- j=2: index 308, coeff 10, sign (+): +10F_{308}.\\n- j=3: index 207, coeff 10, sign (-): -10F_{207}.\\n- j=4: index 106, coeff 5, sign (+): +5F_{106}.\\n- j=5: index 5, coeff 1, sign (-): -F_5.\\nSo\\nS = F_{510} - 5F_{409} + 10F_{308} - 10F_{207} + 5F_{106} - F_{5}.\\nThis matches the given form\\nF_{n1} - 5F_{n2} + 10F_{n3} - 10F_{n4} + 5F_{n5} - F_{n6}.\\nBy uniqueness of the representation, we identify\\nn1 = 510,\\nn2 = 409,\\nn3 = 308,\\nn4 = 207,\\nn5 = 106,\\nn6 = 5.\\nTheir sum is\\nn1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 + n6 = 510 + 409 + 308 + 207 + 106 + 5 = 1545.\\nSo Problem 1’s answer is 1545.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe need the maximum possible value over x>0 of\\nsin( arctan(x/9) - arctan(x/16) ).\\nLet A = arctan(x/9), B = arctan(x/16). Then\\nsin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B.\\nUsing right-triangle definitions:\\nFor A = arctan(x/9): opposite = x, adjacent = 9, hypotenuse = sqrt(9^2 + x^2) = sqrt(81 + x^2).\\nSo sin A = x / sqrt(81 + x^2), cos A = 9 / sqrt(81 + x^2).\\nFor B = arctan(x/16): opposite = x, adjacent = 16, hypotenuse = sqrt(16^2 + x^2) = sqrt(256 + x^2).\\nSo sin B = x / sqrt(256 + x^2), cos B = 16 / sqrt(256 + x^2).\\nThen\\nsin(A - B) = (x / sqrt(81 + x^2))*(16 / sqrt(256 + x^2)) - (9 / sqrt(81 + x^2))*(x / sqrt(256 + x^2)).\\nFactor common terms:\\n= x * (16 - 9) / [sqrt(81 + x^2) * sqrt(256 + x^2)] = 7x / sqrt((81 + x^2)(256 + x^2)).\\nSet f(x) = 7x / sqrt((x^2+81)(x^2+256)), x>0. The constant factor 7 only scales the function, so maximizing f(x) is equivalent to maximizing\\ng(x) = x / sqrt((x^2+81)(x^2+256)).\\nInstead, maximize g^2(x) to avoid square roots:\\nG(x) = g(x)^2 = x^2 / ((x^2+81)(x^2+256)), x>0.\\nIf G is maximized at some x>0, then g is maximized at the same x, and f’s maximum will just be 7 times the maximum of g.\\nLet t = x^2 > 0. Then\\nG(t) = t / ((t+81)(t+256)) = t / (t^2 + 337t + 81*256).\\nCompute 81*256 = 81*(200+56) = 16200 + 4536 = 20736. So\\nG(t) = t / (t^2 + 337t + 20736), t>0.\\nTo find the maximum, differentiate G with respect to t and set to zero.\\nWrite denominator as D(t) = t^2 + 337t + 20736. Then\\nG(t) = t / D(t).\\nDerivative via quotient rule:\\nG'(t) = [1 * D(t) - t * D'(t)] / [D(t)]^2.\\nCompute D'(t) = 2t + 337.\\nThus the numerator N(t) is\\nN(t) = D(t) - t D'(t) = (t^2 + 337t + 20736) - t(2t + 337).\\nExpand t(2t+337) = 2t^2 + 337t. So\\nN(t) = t^2 + 337t + 20736 - (2t^2 + 337t) = -t^2 + 20736.\\nThus\\nG'(t) = (-t^2 + 20736) / [D(t)]^2.\\nCritical points satisfy N(t)=0 ⇒ -t^2 + 20736 = 0 ⇒ t^2 = 20736 ⇒ t = sqrt(20736).\\nSince t>0, take t = sqrt(20736). Compute sqrt(20736). Factor 20736:\\n20736 = 144 * 144 = 12^2 * 12^2 = (12^2)^2 = 12^4 = (12^2)^2 = 144^2.\\nIndeed 144*144 = 20736.\\nSo t = 144.\\nRecall t = x^2 ⇒ x^2 = 144 ⇒ x = 12 (since x>0).\\nWe should verify this is a maximum. For large t, G(t) ~ t / t^2 = 1/t → 0, and for t→0^+, G(t)→0. Since G is continuous and positive on t>0 and has a single critical point where derivative changes sign (N(t) positive if t^2<20736, negative if t^2>20736), it must be the global maximum. So maximum occurs at x=12.\\nNow compute the maximum value:\\nG(144) = 144 / ((144+81)(144+256)). First find sums:\\n144+81 = 225,\\n144+256 = 400.\\nSo\\nG(144) = 144 / (225 * 400) = 144 / 90000.\\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 144:\\n90000 / 144 = 625, so 144 / 90000 = 1 / 625.\\nThus max G is 1/625. Then\\nmax g(x) = sqrt(max G) = sqrt(1/625) = 1/25.\\nFinally,\\nmax f(x) = 7 * max g(x) = 7 * (1/25) = 7/25.\\nTherefore the maximum value of sin(arctan(x/9) - arctan(x/16)) over x>0 is 7/25.\\n\\nAnswers:\\nProblem 1: 1545.\\nProblem 2: 7/25.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1545\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"7/25\"\n}",
