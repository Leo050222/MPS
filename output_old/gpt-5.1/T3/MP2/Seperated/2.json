Then the congruences are modulo m.\\nCompute a convenient linear combination to eliminate a and b in a way that yields 2a + 6b.\\nFirst form 3*(4a+2b) − 2*(3a+5b):\\n3*(4a+2b) = 12a + 6b\\n2*(3a+5b) = 6a + 10b\\nSubtract: (12a + 6b) − (6a + 10b) = 6a − 4b = 2(3a − 2b).\\nOn the RHS using the congruences:\\n3*(4a+2b) ≡ 3*25 = 75 (mod m)\\n2*(3a+5b) ≡ 2*19 = 38 (mod m)\\nSo 6a − 4b ≡ 75 − 38 = 37 (mod m).\\nThus 6a − 4b ≡ 37 (mod m). Call this (1).\\nWe want 2a + 6b. Form another linear combination that produces this:\\nCompute (3a + 5b) + (4a + 2b):\\n(3a + 5b) + (4a + 2b) = 7a + 7b = 7(a + b).\\nModulo m, that sum is 19 + 25 = 44.\\nSo 7(a + b) ≡ 44 (mod m). Call this (2).\\nWe want 2a + 6b = 2(a + 3b). Express a + 3b in terms of a + b and something involving 6a − 4b.\\nConsider solving for a and b linearly over the rationals (ignoring modular aspects) from the equalities\\n3a + 5b = 19 + k1 m\\n4a + 2b = 25 + k2 m\\nfor integers k1, k2, then compute 2a + 6b as a function of m and the ki, and then enforce integrality of a, b and positivity.\\nSolve the linear system in general.\\nWrite it in matrix form:\\n[3 5][a] = [19 + k1 m]\\n[4 2][b]   [25 + k2 m]\\nDeterminant: 3*2 − 5*4 = 6 − 20 = −14.\\nSo\\n[a] = (1/−14) * [ 2  −5][19 + k1 m]\\n[b]               [−4   3][25 + k2 m]\\nCompute a:\\na = (1/−14)[2(19 + k1 m) − 5(25 + k2 m)]\\n= (1/−14)[38 + 2k1 m − 125 − 5k2 m]\\n= (1/−14)[−87 + (2k1 − 5k2)m]\\n= (87 − (2k1 − 5k2)m)/14.\\nCompute b:\\nb = (1/−14)[−4(19 + k1 m) + 3(25 + k2 m)]\\n= (1/−14)[−76 − 4k1 m + 75 + 3k2 m]\\n= (1/−14)[−1 + (−4k1 + 3k2)m]\\n= (1 − (−4k1 + 3k2)m)/14.\\nNow compute 2a + 6b in terms of m, k1, k2.\\n2a = 2*(87 − (2k1 − 5k2)m)/14 = (174 − 2(2k1 − 5k2)m)/14.\\n6b = 6*(1 − (−4k1 + 3k2)m)/14 = (6 − 6(−4k1 + 3k2)m)/14.\\nAdd:\\n2a + 6b = [174 + 6 − 2(2k1 − 5k2)m − 6(−4k1 + 3k2)m]/14\\n= [180 − m(2(2k1 − 5k2) + 6(−4k1 + 3k2))]/14.\\nSimplify coefficient of m:\\n2(2k1 − 5k2) = 4k1 − 10k2.\\n6(−4k1 + 3k2) = −24k1 + 18k2.\\nSum: (4k1 − 10k2) + (−24k1 + 18k2) = −20k1 + 8k2 = −4(5k1 − 2k2).\\nSo\\n2a + 6b = [180 − m(−4(5k1 − 2k2))]/14 = [180 + 4m(5k1 − 2k2)]/14.\\nSimplify dividing numerator and denominator by 2:\\n2a + 6b = [90 + 2m(5k1 − 2k2)]/7.\\nLet T = 5k1 − 2k2, so 2a + 6b = (90 + 2mT)/7.\\nSince 2a + 6b is an integer, 90 + 2mT must be divisible by 7. But 2 is invertible modulo 7, so this is equivalent to 45 + mT ≡ 0 (mod 7) or mT ≡ −45 ≡ −3 ≡ 4 (mod 7), because 45 ≡ 3 mod 7.\\nNext, impose that a and b are positive integers. Write a and b in terms of m, k1, k2 more cleanly, and find conditions.\\nWe already have\\na = (87 − (2k1 − 5k2)m)/14,\\nb = (1 − (−4k1 + 3k2)m)/14.\\nDefine U = 2k1 − 5k2 and V = −4k1 + 3k2.\\nThen a = (87 − U m)/14, b = (1 − V m)/14.\\nWe need a, b ∈ Z+.\\nSo 87 − Um > 0 and 1 − V m > 0.\\nSince m = n+1 is positive integer (n is a modulus minus 1), assume m ≥ 1.\\nThus U and V must be such that the numerators are positive and divisible by 14.\\nAdditionally, m, U, V are tied through (k1, k2) integers.\\nHowever, the problem likely expects that n is uniquely determined from consistency. Another way: treat initial relations as congruence relations for 2a + 6b itself.\\nExpress 2a + 6b directly in terms of 3a+5b and 4a+2b.\\nWe want coefficients p, q such that:\\np(3a+5b) + q(4a+2b) = 2a + 6b.\\nSolve for p, q:\\nFor a: 3p + 4q = 2.\\nFor b: 5p + 2q = 6.\\nSolve:\\n3p + 4q = 2 => p = (2 − 4q)/3.\\nPlug into 5p + 2q = 6:\\n5(2 − 4q)/3 + 2q = 6.\\n(10 − 20q)/3 + 2q = 6.\\nMultiply by 3:\\n10 − 20q + 6q = 18 => 10 − 14q = 18 => −14q = 8 => q = −8/14 = −4/7.\\nThen p = (2 − 4q)/3 = (2 − 4*(−4/7))/3 = (2 + 16/7)/3 = (14/7 + 16/7)/3 = (30/7)/3 = 30/(21) = 10/7.\\nSo 2a+6b = (10/7)(3a+5b) + (−4/7)(4a+2b).\\nThus 2a+6b ≡ (10/7)*19 − (4/7)*25 (mod m).\\nCompute numerator:\\n10*19 = 190, 4*25 = 100, difference 90, so this is 90/7 modulo m.\\nSince 2a+6b is an integer, 90/7 modulo m must itself correspond to an integer residue. But this is modulo m, not modulo 7, so we must look at the actual integer value of 2a+6b.\\nLet X = 2a+6b.\\nFrom the congruence:\\nX ≡ (10/7)*19 − (4/7)*25 ≡ 90/7 (mod m).\\nThus there exists integer t such that:\\nX = 90/7 + t m.\\nSince X is integer, 90/7 + t m must be integer, so 7 | 90 + 7 t m? That is not the right condition; better: denote X integer, then 7X = 90 + 7tm, so 7X − 7tm = 90, or 7(X − tm) = 90.\\nTherefore 7 divides 90, contradiction since gcd(7,90)=1. This signals that our modular manipulation with rational coefficients is tricky; we should only use integer combinations modulo m.\\nSo instead avoid fractions in modular arithmetic. Instead, look for integer combination of the given two congruences and perhaps a third independent relation to derive 2a+6b uniquely (independent of m).\\nLet us compute the system as actual equalities with unknown multiples of m and then directly derive X without needing k1,k2 explicitly.\\nWe write:\\n3a + 5b = 19 + r m\\n4a + 2b = 25 + s m\\nfor some integers r, s.\\nWe again compute X = 2a + 6b as an integer combination of these:\\nFrom the earlier calculation, 7(2a+6b) = 10(3a+5b) − 4(4a+2b).\\nCheck:\\n10(3a+5b) − 4(4a+2b) = (30a+50b) − (16a+8b) = 14a + 42b = 7(2a+6b). Correct.\\nTherefore\\n7X = 10(3a+5b) − 4(4a+2b).\\nSubstitute the equalities with r,s:\\n7X = 10(19 + r m) − 4(25 + s m) = 190 + 10 r m − 100 − 4 s m = 90 + m(10r − 4s).\\nSo\\n7X = 90 + m(10r − 4s).\\nLet W = 10r − 4s. Then\\n7X = 90 + mW => X = (90 + mW)/7.\\nAs before, but now this is an equality, not modulo. However, X must be integer, so 90 + mW is divisible by 7. So mW ≡ −90 ≡ −6 ≡ 1 (mod 7), since 90 ≡ 6 mod 7.\\nSo mW ≡ 1 (mod 7). This just tells us gcd(m,7)=1 and W ≡ m^{-1} mod 7; not enough.\\nWe need additional constraints from a, b being integers and positive.\\nFind a, b in terms of r, s and m:\\nas found, a = (87 − (2r − 5s)m)/14,\\nb = (1 − (−4r + 3s)m)/14.\\nLet P = 2r − 5s, Q = −4r + 3s.\\nThen a = (87 − Pm)/14, b = (1 − Qm)/14.\\nAlso, X = 2a + 6b = (90 − (2P + 6Q)m)/14.\\nCompute 2P + 6Q:\\n2P = 4r − 10s, 6Q = −24r + 18s ⇒ sum = −20r + 8s = −4(5r − 2s) as before.\\nSo X = (90 + 4(5r − 2s)m)/14 = (45 + 2(5r − 2s)m)/7.\\nWe gain nothing new.\\nInstead, use the fact that n is defined to be the answer to the problem, i.e., n itself must equal the value of 2a+6b. So n = 2a+6b. Then m = n+1 = (2a+6b)+1.\\nThis is the crucial extra condition.\\nSo set m = X + 1, where X = 2a + 6b.\\nWe have the congruences modulo X+1:\\n3a + 5b ≡ 19 (mod X+1),\\n4a + 2b ≡ 25 (mod X+1),\\nwith X = 2a + 6b.\\nWe want to find integer X that allows positive integer solutions a, b.\\nTranslate the congruences to equalities with k, l integers:\\n3a + 5b = 19 + k(X+1)\\n4a + 2b = 25 + l(X+1).\\nWe now solve this system for a, b in terms of X, k, l and then enforce a,b integer and positive. Then see which X works.\\nSolve for a,b directly with X included.\\nFrom 3a + 5b = 19 + k(X+1)  ...(A)\\n4a + 2b = 25 + l(X+1)  ...(B)\\nSolve linearly:\\nMultiply (A) by 2: 6a + 10b = 38 + 2k(X+1).\\nMultiply (B) by 5: 20a + 10b = 125 + 5l(X+1).\\nSubtract: (20a+10b) − (6a+10b) = 14a = 125 + 5l(X+1) − 38 − 2k(X+1).\\nHence\\n14a = 87 + (5l − 2k)(X+1).\\nSo\\na = [87 + (5l − 2k)(X+1)]/14.\\nSimilarly find b. Use (B) maybe. Multiply (A) by 4: 12a + 20b = 76 + 4k(X+1).\\nMultiply (B) by 3: 12a + 6b = 75 + 3l(X+1).\\nSubtract: (12a+20b) − (12a+6b) = 14b = 76 + 4k(X+1) − 75 − 3l(X+1).\\nSo\\n14b = 1 + (4k − 3l)(X+1).\\nThus\\nb = [1 + (4k − 3l)(X+1)]/14.\\nNow express X = 2a + 6b:\\nX = 2a + 6b = 2[87 + (5l − 2k)(X+1)]/14 + 6[1 + (4k − 3l)(X+1)]/14.\\nCompute numerator N (since denominator is 14):\\nN = 2[87 + (5l − 2k)(X+1)] + 6[1 + (4k − 3l)(X+1)].\\nExpand:\\nN = 174 + 2(5l − 2k)(X+1) + 6 + 6(4k − 3l)(X+1)\\n= 180 + [2(5l − 2k) + 6(4k − 3l)](X+1).\\nCompute the bracket:\\n2(5l − 2k) = 10l − 4k,\\n6(4k − 3l) = 24k − 18l.\\nSum: (10l − 4k) + (24k − 18l) = −8l + 20k = 4(5k − 2l).\\nSo\\nN = 180 + 4(5k − 2l)(X+1).\\nThus\\nX = N/14 = [180 + 4(5k − 2l)(X+1)]/14.\\nMultiply both sides by 14:\\n14X = 180 + 4(5k − 2l)(X+1).\\nLet R = 5k − 2l. Then\\n14X = 180 + 4R(X+1) = 180 + 4RX + 4R.\\nRearrange:\\n14X − 4RX = 180 + 4R.\\nFactor X:\\nX(14 − 4R) = 180 + 4R.\\nThus\\nX = (180 + 4R)/(14 − 4R).\\nSimplify dividing numerator and denominator by 2:\\nX = (90 + 2R)/(7 − 2R).\\nWe need X to be a positive integer, and we also must have denominators nonzero: 7 − 2R ≠ 0 ⇒ R ≠ 7/2, automatically since R integer.\\nSo find integer R such that X is positive integer.\\nWrite X = (90 + 2R)/(7 − 2R).\\nLet denominator D = 7 − 2R.\\nThen 90 + 2R must be divisible by D.\\nWe can rewrite in another way by polynomial division to see when integer.\\nCompute 90 + 2R in terms of D:\\nR = (7 − D)/2 ⇒ 2R = 7 − D.\\nThen\\n90 + 2R = 90 + 7 − D = 97 − D.\\nSo X = (97 − D)/D = 97/D − 1.\\nThus D must be a divisor of 97 for X to be integer.\\n97 is prime, so D ∈ {±1, ±97}.\\nThen X = 97/D − 1.\\nAlso D = 7 − 2R must be even? Let's check: 2R is even, so 7 − 2R is odd. So D is odd, but all ±1, ±97 are odd, so fine.\\nNow compute possibilities:\\n1) D = 1 ⇒ X = 97/1 − 1 = 96.\\n2) D = −1 ⇒ X = 97/(−1) − 1 = −97 − 1 = −98 (reject since X positive required).\\n3) D = 97 ⇒ X = 97/97 − 1 = 1 − 1 = 0 (reject since X must be positive; n = X would be 0, contradicting positive a,b and mod n+1>1 scenario).\\n4) D = −97 ⇒ X = 97/(−97) − 1 = −1 − 1 = −2 (reject).\\nSo only integer positive solution is X = 96.\\nThus n = X = 96.\\nWe also should confirm that there exist positive integers a, b satisfying the congruences with n+1=97.\\nNow m = n+1 = 97 (prime).\\nOur congruences:\\n3a + 5b ≡ 19 (mod 97)\\n4a + 2b ≡ 25 (mod 97).\\nBut we already implicitly used the algebraic relation that enforced these, and produced R = 5k − 2l via D=7 − 2R = 1 ⇒ R = 3. Solve for some k, l consistent with R=5k−2l=3, then obtain explicit a,b.\\nFrom D = 7 − 2R =1 ⇒ 7 − 2R = 1 ⇒ 2R = 6 ⇒ R=3, consistent.\\nSo 5k − 2l = 3.\\nOne simple integer solution: take k = 1, then 5(1) − 2l = 3 ⇒ 5 − 2l = 3 ⇒ 2l = 2 ⇒ l = 1.\\nSo choose k = l = 1.\\nThen plug into the formulas for a,b with X=96.\\nRecall with general X:\\n14a = 87 + (5l − 2k)(X+1),\\n14b = 1 + (4k − 3l)(X+1).\\nFor k=l=1 ⇒ 5l−2k = 3, 4k−3l =1.\\nAnd X+1 = 97.\\nSo\\n14a = 87 + 3*97 = 87 + 291 = 378 ⇒ a = 378/14 = 27.\\n14b = 1 + 1*97 = 98 ⇒ b = 98/14 = 7.\\nSo a=27, b=7 are positive integers.\\nCheck original congruences with n+1=97:\\n3a+5b = 3*27 + 5*7 = 81 + 35 = 116 ≡ 116−97=19 (mod 97), correct.\\n4a+2b = 4*27 + 2*7 = 108 + 14 = 122 ≡ 122−97=25 (mod 97), correct.\\nSo the constructed solution is valid, and by the earlier reasoning X must be 96.\\nFinally, 2a+6b = 2*27 + 6*7 = 54 + 42 = 96. So for Problem 1, answer is 96.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nGiven quadrilateral ABCD with side lengths AB=2, BC=3, CD=5, DA=4. We seek the maximum possible radius r of a circle inscribed in quadrilateral ABCD (i.e., tangent to all four sides). For a circle to be inscribed, the quadrilateral must be tangential: sums of lengths of opposite sides equal:\\nAB + CD = BC + DA.\\nHere AB + CD = 2 + 5 = 7, BC + DA = 3 + 4 = 7. So the side lengths satisfy the tangential condition, meaning there exist tangential quadrilaterals with these side lengths. Among all such, we want the one with maximal inradius r.\\nFor any tangential quadrilateral, area K relates to the inradius r and semiperimeter s by:\\nK = r * s.\\nPerimeter p = 2+3+5+4=14, so semiperimeter s = p/2 = 7.\\nThus for any tangential quadrilateral with those side lengths, we have r = K/7. To maximize r, we must maximize the area K of such a tangential quadrilateral.\\nGiven fixed side lengths, the tangential quadrilateral of maximal area is cyclic (has a circumcircle). This is a known result: among all quadrilaterals with given side lengths, area is maximized when the quadrilateral is cyclic (Brahmagupta's generalization of Heron's formula). For tangential + cyclic quadrilaterals with side lengths a,b,c,d, the configuration is a bicentric quadrilateral. So we seek the area of the bicentric quadrilateral with sides 2,3,5,4.\\nHowever, not every set of four side lengths that admits a tangential quadrilateral also admits a cyclic one. For a quadrilateral with sides a,b,c,d to be bicentric, two conditions must hold:\\n1) Tangential condition: a + c = b + d (already satisfied).\\n2) Cyclic condition (Pitot-like): the products of opposite sides satisfy a*c + b*d = (a + c)(b + d)/2 (a more specialized relation), or equivalently, there exists a positive inradius and circumradius relation. But more conveniently, we can use the Pitot tangential condition plus the constraint that the sum of opposite angles is 180°.\\nInstead of using a known characterization, we can treat the quadrilateral as composed of two triangles sharing a diagonal and enforce that both triangles have the same circumcircle (cyclic quadrilateral) and the same incircle touch pattern. However, this is complicated. There is a simpler path: the maximum area over all quadrilaterals with given sides 2,3,5,4 (not necessarily tangential) occurs for a cyclic quadrilateral, and Brahmagupta's formula gives that area. Then, since we already know that among tangential quadrilaterals the area is bounded above by the maximum area over all quadrilaterals with those sides, and that maximum is achieved by the cyclic quadrilateral (which might or might not be tangential), we should check whether the cyclic quadrilateral with sides 2,3,5,4 is in fact tangential. If it is, then its area Kmax gives the maximal r = Kmax/7.\\nBut even if the cyclic configuration is not tangential, the maximal area among tangential quadrilaterals might be smaller than the cyclic area. We need to actually show or compute the maximal area under the tangential constraint.\\nA stronger theorem: A convex quadrilateral is bicentric if and only if it is tangential and cyclic simultaneously. There is a known necessary and sufficient condition for a quadrilateral with side lengths a,b,c,d to be bicentric: it must satisfy both the Pitot tangential condition a + c = b + d and the Robbins condition:\\n(a + c)(b + d)(ac + bd − (a + c)(b + d)/2) = (a b + c d)^2.\\nRather than invoking that, we can parametrize a tangential quadrilateral and maximize area subject to fixed side lengths.\\nFor a tangential quadrilateral, side lengths can be expressed in terms of tangency segment lengths from vertices: Let the circle touch sides AB, BC, CD, DA at points E, F, G, H respectively, and let AE = x, EB = y, BF = u, FC = v, CG = w, GD = z, DH = p, HA = q. For a tangential quadrilateral, tangents from the same vertex are equal: AE = AH, BF = BE, CG = CF, DG = DH. So denote:\\nAE = AH = x,\\nBE = BF = y,\\nCF = CG = z,\\nDG = DH = t.\\nThen sides:\\nAB = AE + EB = x + y,\\nBC = BF + FC = y + z,\\nCD = CG + GD = z + t,\\nDA = DH + HA = t + x.\\nGiven lengths AB=2, BC=3, CD=5, DA=4, we have the system:\\nx + y = 2\\ny + z = 3\\nz + t = 5\\nt + x = 4.\\nSolve these.\\nFrom x + y = 2 ⇒ y = 2 − x.\\nThen y + z = 3 ⇒ (2 − x) + z = 3 ⇒ z = 1 + x.\\nThen z + t = 5 ⇒ (1 + x) + t = 5 ⇒ t = 4 − x.\\nFinally t + x = 4 ⇒ (4 − x) + x = 4, which is automatically satisfied. So continuous family of tangential quadrilaterals parameterized by x, with:\\ny = 2 − x,\\nz = 1 + x,\\nt = 4 − x.\\nFor the segments to be positive, we need x>0, y>0, z>0, t>0.\\nSo:\\nx > 0,\\n2 − x > 0 ⇒ x < 2,\\n1 + x > 0 ⇒ x > −1,\\n4 − x > 0 ⇒ x < 4.\\nThus 0 < x < 2. So there is indeed a 1-parameter family of tangential quadrilaterals with the specified side lengths.\\nAll share the same incircle radius r? No: the inradius is fixed by area and semiperimeter. The side lengths and tangency structure do not uniquely determine area; different shapes with same sides can have different area, so r varies with x. But we know that for a tangential quadrilateral, K = r s with s fixed at 7, so maximizing area over this family is equivalent to maximizing r.\\nNext, parametrize coordinates and compute area in terms of x. Use radial construction: Let the incircle have radius r and center O at origin. Place AB horizontal above O, and represent the directions of side normals by four contact angles around the circle. But the tangency segment variables x,y,z,t already encode arc measures times radius. More directly, we can find the angles between sides from the tangency lengths.\\nHowever, there is a standard formula for the area of a tangential quadrilateral in terms of r and side lengths: K = r s, with s fixed, so r is determined solely by K. To compute K, one can split the quadrilateral into two triangles along a diagonal, say AC. Each triangle has sides: in triangle ABC, sides AB=2, BC=3, and diagonal AC; in triangle ADC, sides AD=4, DC=5, and the same AC. Let AC = d.\\nThe area of the quadrilateral is K = K1 + K2, the sum of areas of triangles ABC and ADC.\\nUsing Heron's formula for each triangle:\\nTriangle ABC: sides 2,3,d. Semiperimeter s1 = (2+3+d)/2 = (5 + d)/2.\\nArea K1 = sqrt[s1(s1 − 2)(s1 − 3)(s1 − d)].\\nTriangle ADC: sides 4,5,d. Semiperimeter s2 = (4 + 5 + d)/2 = (9 + d)/2.\\nArea K2 = sqrt[s2(s2 − 4)(s2 − 5)(s2 − d)].\\nThus K(d) = K1(d) + K2(d).\\nThe inradius r = K/7.\\nWe must now impose that the quadrilateral is tangential. But we already enforced tangentialness via AB+CD=BC+AD; however, that condition is necessary and sufficient for existence of a tangential quadrilateral with these side lengths, but does not constrain the diagonal d further: for a general quadrilateral with given side lengths, the diagonal length can vary over an interval determined by triangle inequalities, but the tangential property does not directly constrain d. The incircle's tangency structure will change with the angles; we need to relate r to d via geometry, not just area.\\nInstead, parametrize more concretely using the tangency lengths x,y,z,t. We can derive diagonal AC in terms of x,y,z,t and r and then write K as r s and also as sum of triangle areas, leading to an equation relating r and x. Then maximize r over 0<x<2.\\nBut there is a more straightforward approach: the incenter O is at distances r from all sides. Consider the quadrilateral formed by connecting O to the vertices. That splits ABCD into 4 right triangles: AOB, BOC, COD, DOA, each with one leg r and the other leg equal to the tangency segment at that vertex.\\nSpecifically, at vertex A, segments to tangency points on AB and AD are both length x, and the angle between the sides at A is θ_A. The distances from O to the sides are r, and the distances from O to A along the angle bisectors have projections giving relationships: in triangle AOB, the tangent lengths along AB add x and y etc. This gets messy.\\nGiven the complexity and the specific numbers, it's plausible that the maximal area tangential quadrilateral corresponds to the bicentric case, i.e., the one which is both cyclic and tangential. For given side lengths with tangential condition satisfied, there is exactly one bicentric quadrilateral if it exists, and its area is given by Brahmagupta's formula using s = 7:\\nK_bicentric = sqrt[(s − a)(s − b)(s − c)(s − d)] = sqrt[(7 − 2)(7 − 3)(7 − 5)(7 − 4)] = sqrt[5 * 4 * 2 * 3] = sqrt[120].\\nBut Brahmagupta's formula gives the area for the cyclic quadrilateral with these sides, not necessarily tangential. However, if a quadrilateral is bicentric, then it is both tangential and cyclic, and so its side lengths must satisfy both conditions. We already have the tangential condition. The remaining question: does there exist a cyclic quadrilateral with side lengths 2,3,5,4 that is also tangential? Equivalently, are there cyclic quadrilaterals with these side lengths at all? If yes, the one with maximum area is cyclic and has area sqrt(120), by Brahmagupta.\\nFor arbitrary side lengths 2,3,5,4, as long as the polygon inequalities allow forming a quadrilateral (largest side < sum of other three: 5 < 2+3+4=9, OK), there is a cyclic quadrilateral with those side lengths (one can arrange the sides consecutively around a circle with appropriate chord lengths). So a cyclic quadrilateral with sides (2,3,5,4) exists, and its maximal area is K_cyc = sqrt[(7−2)(7−3)(7−5)(7−4)] = sqrt(120).\\nWe must now check if this cyclic quadrilateral is also tangential. However, the tangential condition a+c=b+d is only a condition on side lengths, not on angles. So any quadrilateral with those side lengths automatically has AB+CD=BC+DA=7. But that condition alone doesn't guarantee tangentiality; the side arrangement in the plane also matters. Yet using Pitot's theorem, for convex quadrilaterals, tangentiality is equivalent to the existence of an incircle tangent to all sides, which for given side sequence requires that there exist angles satisfying the tangent length constraints. But since we already solved for tangency segments x,y,z,t from the side lengths algebraically, we know there exists at least one tangential quadrilateral with these side lengths. The cyclic quadrilateral with same sides may not coincide with that tangential configuration; but nothing prohibits that we adjust angles to achieve both cyclic and tangential; the lengths satisfy the necessary algebraic relations, and there is a known theorem for bicentric quadrilaterals: a convex quadrilateral with given sides a,b,c,d is bicentric if and only if it is both tangential (a+c=b+d) and the opposite sides satisfy another condition involving side lengths and semi-diagonal lengths. However, for the purpose of maximizing the inradius in the family of tangential quadrilaterals with these fixed side lengths, the extremum should occur at a symmetric point, which for typical side-length problems corresponds to the bicentric case where the two circles (inscribed and circumscribed) are present.\\nWe can test if a tangential quadrilateral with sides 2,3,5,4 can be cyclic by using the condition that in a bicentric quadrilateral the inradius r and circumradius R satisfy an equation due to Fuss:\\n1/(R − r)^2 = 1/(a + c)^2 + 1/(b + d)^2.\\nHere a+c = b+d =7, so RHS = 2/49.\\nThus (R − r)^2 = 49/2.\\nAlso, for a cyclic quadrilateral, area K relates to R via\\nK = sqrt[(s − a)(s − b)(s − c)(s − d)] = sqrt(120) and Ptolemy's theorem might also come in, but we can use the formula for circumradius of a cyclic quadrilateral: for a cyclic quadrilateral with sides a,b,c,d and area K,\\nR = sqrt[(ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc)]/(4 K).\\nBut that formula is complex. Another easier relation: K = 4 R^2 * product of sines of half-angles, not directly helpful.\\nGiven the Olympiad style, a more straightforward approach is to note that area of a tangential quadrilateral with side lengths a,b,c,d and semiperimeter s is K = sqrt[(s − a)(s − c) * s^2 − (something)], but there is no such simple formula.\\nGiven the time, we can instead directly think: In the family of tangential quadrilaterals parameterized by x in (0,2), the extreme values of r should occur at endpoints or at critical interior points where some symmetry emerges. At the endpoints, as x→0+ or x→2−, one of the tangency segments goes to 0, causing the quadrilateral to become degenerate and the area and r to go to 0. Therefore the maximum is attained at an interior value of x. Symmetry suggests x such that opposite tangency segments are equal: for a bicentric quadrilateral, typically x=z and y=t or some symmetric pattern. Our expressions:\\nx, y=2−x, z=1+x, t=4−x.\\nCheck if there is value x where pairs of opposite vertices have equal tangent sums or some pattern. For example, require x = z and y = t? That would give:\\nx = 1 + x ⇒ impossible.\\nOr x = t and y = z:\\nx = 4 − x ⇒ 2x=4 ⇒ x=2 (endpoint); y= z ⇒ 2−x=1+x ⇒ x=1/?, solve: 2−x=1+x ⇒ 1=2x ⇒ x=1/2. But then earlier x=t gave x=2, inconsistent. So no such pattern.\\nInstead, for a bicentric quadrilateral, the incenter and circumcenter have some relations, but not simple in these parameters.\\nHowever, note: the maximal area for tangential quadrilaterals with those side lengths cannot exceed the maximal area among all quadrilaterals with same sides, which is sqrt(120). Moreover, it is known (e.g., by considering variational arguments) that within the class of tangential quadrilaterals with given side lengths, area is maximized when the quadrilateral is cyclic as well, i.e., when it is bicentric. Thus, the maximal tangent quadrilateral is bicentric and has area K = sqrt(120). Therefore maximal inradius is\\nr_max = K / s = sqrt(120)/7.\\nWe can simplify sqrt(120) = 2 sqrt(30). So r_max = 2 sqrt(30)/7.\\nThus Problem 2 answer: 2*sqrt(30)/7.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: 96.\\nProblem 2: 2*sqrt(30)/7.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"96\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"2*sqrt(30)/7\"\n}",
