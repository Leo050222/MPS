  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe choose (x,y) uniformly in the unit square S = [0,1]×[0,1]. We need the probability that (u,v) = (3x+2y, x+4y) also lies in S, i.e.\\n0 ≤ 3x+2y ≤ 1,\\n0 ≤ x+4y ≤ 1,\\nwith 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.\\nThis is a linear transformation T: (x,y) ↦ (3x+2y, x+4y). The determinant of the matrix [[3,2],[1,4]] is det = 3·4 − 2·1 = 12 − 2 = 10, so the area scales by factor 10 under T. The preimage of the unit square in the uv-plane under T is a parallelogram in the xy-plane of area 1/|det| = 1/10.\\nOur desired region is the intersection of that parallelogram with the original unit square [0,1]^2. The probability is the area of that intersection (since (x,y) is uniform on the unit square).\\nWrite the inequalities explicitly:\\n3x + 2y ≥ 0 and 3x + 2y ≤ 1,\\nx + 4y ≥ 0 and x + 4y ≤ 1,\\nwith 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1. The lower bounds (≥0) are automatically satisfied for x,y ≥ 0, so we just require\\n3x + 2y ≤ 1,   (1)\\nx + 4y ≤ 1.    (2)\\nWithin the first quadrant and x,y ≤ 1, these two lines form the nontrivial constraints.\\nSolve their intersection:\\n3x + 2y = 1,\\nx + 4y = 1.\\nFrom the second: x = 1 − 4y. Substitute into the first:\\n3(1 − 4y) + 2y = 1 → 3 − 12y + 2y = 1 → 3 − 10y = 1 → 10y = 2 → y = 1/5.\\nThen x = 1 − 4(1/5) = 1 − 4/5 = 1/5.\\nSo the lines intersect at (1/5, 1/5). On the axes they intersect at (1/3,0) for 3x+2y=1 and (1,0.25) etc., but the region from (1,0.25) is excluded by the other line; the bounded feasible region inside [0,1]^2 is the polygon with vertices (0,0), (1/3,0), (1/5,1/5), (0,1/4).\\nCheck: for (0,1/4), inequality (1) gives 2·(1/4)=1/2 ≤1, inequality (2) gives 4·(1/4)=1, okay; for (1/3,0), (1) is 3·(1/3)=1; (2) is 1/3 ≤1. So the feasible region is the quadrilateral with those four vertices, since for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/3 the upper bound on y is min((1−3x)/2, (1−x)/4), and they cross exactly at (1/5,1/5); below that x, (1−x)/4 is smaller, above that x, (1−3x)/2 is smaller.\\nCompute its area by splitting at x=1/5, using integration or polygon area.\\nUse integration:\\nFor 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/5, y ranges from 0 to y_max = (1 − x)/4.\\nFor 1/5 ≤ x ≤ 1/3, y ranges from 0 to y_max = (1 − 3x)/2.\\nArea = ∫_0^{1/5} (1−x)/4 dx + ∫_{1/5}^{1/3} (1−3x)/2 dx.\\nFirst integral:\\n∫_0^{1/5} (1−x)/4 dx = (1/4)[x − x^2/2]_0^{1/5} = (1/4)[(1/5) − (1/50)] = (1/4)[10/50 − 1/50] = (1/4)(9/50) = 9/200.\\nSecond integral:\\n∫_{1/5}^{1/3} (1−3x)/2 dx = (1/2)[x − (3/2)x^2]_{1/5}^{1/3}.\\nEvaluate at x=1/3:\\nx − (3/2)x^2 = 1/3 − (3/2)(1/9) = 1/3 − (3/18) = 1/3 − 1/6 = 1/6.\\nAt x=1/5:\\nx − (3/2)x^2 = 1/5 − (3/2)(1/25) = 1/5 − 3/50 = 10/50 − 3/50 = 7/50.\\nDifference: 1/6 − 7/50 = (25/150 − 21/150) = 4/150 = 2/75.\\nMultiply by 1/2: (1/2)(2/75) = 1/75.\\nTotal area = 9/200 + 1/75.\\nFind common denominator: lcm(200,75) = 600.\\n9/200 = 27/600, 1/75 = 8/600, sum = 35/600 = 7/120.\\nSo the probability is 7/120. In lowest terms, a=7, b=120, so 100a + b = 700 + 120 = 820.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have a 13-card bridge hand from a standard 52-card deck. We are told the hand contains exactly 4 cards that are among A,K,Q,J (\\\"honor\\\" cards). Each such honor contributes points: A=4, K=3, Q=2, J=1. There are 16 total honor cards in the deck (4 of each rank) and 36 non-honor cards.\\nWe condition on having exactly 4 honors in the hand. Within that event, all subsets of 4 of the 16 honors are equally likely, independent of which 9 non-honors fill out the hand (since we condition on exactly 4 honors). So the problem reduces to: if we pick uniformly at random 4 cards from the 16 honors, what is the probability that the total point count ≥ 13?\\nTotal possibilities for the honor subset: C(16,4).\\nWe must count compositions of 4 honors into A,K,Q,J-type counts (a,k,q,j nonnegative integers) such that a+k+q+j = 4, and 4a+3k+2q+1j ≥ 13, with at most 4 of each type (a ≤ 4, k ≤ 4, q ≤ 4, j ≤ 4). The last restriction will be satisfied automatically since we only have 4 total honors; we can’t exceed 4 of any one type.\\nFor each (a,k,q,j) satisfying the constraints, the number of 4-card subsets that realize that pattern is C(4,a)·C(4,k)·C(4,q)·C(4,j), because there are 4 cards of each rank.\\nWe then divide the sum of these counts for patterns with total points ≥13 by C(16,4).\\nLet the point total be P = 4a+3k+2q+j. Given a+k+q+j = 4, the maximum is when all are aces: P=16; minimum is when all are jacks: P=4.\\nWe need P ≥13. Enumerate all patterns by a (number of aces) and then solve for (k,q,j).\\nCase a = 4: then k=q=j=0, P=16 ≥13. Pattern (4,0,0,0), multiplicity C(4,4)=1, others C(4,0)=1, so count = 1.\\nCase a = 3: then k+q+j = 1. So exactly one other honor that is K or Q or J.\\nSubcases:\\n(3,1,0,0): P = 3*4 + 3*1 = 15 ≥13, multiplicity C(4,3)·C(4,1) = 4·4 = 16.\\n(3,0,1,0): P = 12 + 2 = 14 ≥13, multiplicity 4·4=16.\\n(3,0,0,1): P = 12 + 1 = 13 ≥13, multiplicity 4·4=16.\\nTotal for a=3: 16+16+16 = 48.\\nCase a = 2: then k+q+j = 2. Compute P = 8 + 3k + 2q + j. We need 8 + (3k+2q+j) ≥13 → 3k+2q+j ≥5. Since k+q+j=2, possible distributions:\\n(2,0,0): then k=2,q=0,j=0 → contribution to extra points: 3*2 =6 ≥5, so P=14.\\n(1,1,0): extra = 3+2=5 → P=13.\\n(1,0,1): extra = 3+1=4 → P=12 <13, reject.\\n(0,2,0): extra=2*2=4 → P=12 <13, reject.\\n(0,1,1): extra=2+1=3 → P=11 <13, reject.\\n(0,0,2): extra=2*1=2 → P=10 <13, reject.\\nSo valid subpatterns:\\n(2,2,0,0): a=2,k=2,q=0,j=0, multiplicity C(4,2)·C(4,2) = 6·6=36.\\n(2,1,1,0): a=2,k=1,q=1,j=0, multiplicity C(4,2)·C(4,1)·C(4,1) = 6·4·4=96.\\nTotal for a=2: 36+96 = 132.\\nCase a = 1: then k+q+j = 3, and P = 4 + 3k + 2q + j ≥ 13 → 3k+2q+j ≥9.\\nList all nonnegative triples (k,q,j) summing to 3.\\n(3,0,0): extra=3*3=9, P=13, valid.\\n(2,1,0): extra=6+2=8, P=12, reject.\\n(2,0,1): extra=6+1=7, P=11, reject.\\n(1,2,0): extra=3+4=7, P=11, reject.\\n(1,1,1): extra=3+2+1=6, P=10, reject.\\n(1,0,2): extra=3+2=5, P=9, reject.\\n(0,3,0): extra=6, P=10, reject.\\n(0,2,1): extra=4+1=5, P=9, reject.\\n(0,1,2): extra=2+2=4, P=8, reject.\\n(0,0,3): extra=3, P=7, reject.\\nSo only (1,3,0,0): a=1,k=3,q=0,j=0, multiplicity C(4,1)·C(4,3) = 4·4=16.\\nCase a = 0: then k+q+j = 4, P = 3k + 2q + j ≥13.\\nEnumerate (k,q,j) with sum 4.\\n(4,0,0): extra=12, P=12, reject.\\n(3,1,0): extra=9+2=11, P=11, reject.\\n(3,0,1): extra=9+1=10, P=10, reject.\\n(2,2,0): extra=6+4=10, P=10, reject.\\n(2,1,1): extra=6+2+1=9, P=9, reject.\\n(2,0,2): extra=6+2=8, P=8, reject.\\n(1,3,0): extra=3+6=9, P=9, reject.\\n(1,2,1): extra=3+4+1=8, P=8, reject.\\n(1,1,2): extra=3+2+2=7, P=7, reject.\\n(1,0,3): extra=3+3=6, P=6, reject.\\n(0,4,0): extra=8, P=8, reject.\\n(0,3,1): extra=6+1=7, P=7, reject.\\n(0,2,2): extra=4+2=6, P=6, reject.\\n(0,1,3): extra=2+3=5, P=5, reject.\\n(0,0,4): extra=4, P=4, reject.\\nSo no valid patterns with a=0.\\nCollect all valid patterns and counts:\\n(4,0,0,0): 1\\n(3,1,0,0): 16\\n(3,0,1,0): 16\\n(3,0,0,1): 16\\n(2,2,0,0): 36\\n(2,1,1,0): 96\\n(1,3,0,0): 16\\nTotal favorable count N = 1 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 36 + 96 + 16.\\nCompute stepwise: 1+16=17, +16=33, +16=49, +36=85, +96=181, +16=197.\\nSo N = 197.\\nTotal possible 4-honor combinations = C(16,4) = 1820.\\nSo the desired conditional probability is 197/1820. Simplify the fraction: 1820 = 2^2·5·7·13. Check gcd with 197.\\nTry dividing 197 by primes: 197 mod 3= (180+17) mod3 = 2, mod5=2, mod7: 7*28=196, remainder1; mod13:13*15=195, remainder2. So gcd(197,1820)=1. Fraction is already in lowest terms.\\nThus the probability is 197/1820.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: probability = 7/120, so 100a+b = 820.\\nProblem 2: conditional probability = 197/1820.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"820\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"197/1820\"\n}",
