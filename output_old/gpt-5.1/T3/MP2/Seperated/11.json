Then\\n  s = x(x^2 - 63y)\\nGiven arbitrary integers a, b, we can realize many (x, y) pairs, but we do not need a full classification. Instead, search for integer pairs (a, b) giving s a bit above 2012, and then try to push it down.\\nCompute some symmetric cases b = -a:\\n  If b = -a, then a + b = 0, so s = 0, which is < 2012, so not allowed but shows range can cross 0.\\nCheck b = a:\\n  Then a^3 + b^3 = 2a^3, ab(a + b) = a^2(2a) = 2a^3, so\\n  s = 2a^3 - 60·2a^3 = 2a^3(1 - 60) = -118a^3, which becomes very negative for large |a|, again not useful directly.\\nBetter approach: treat s(a, b) as a cubic form and note it is unbounded above and below over Z^2, so some integer values near any large target should be achievable. To find the minimum s ≥ 2012, try to solve the equation s = 2012 + k for small nonnegative integers k.\\nWe observe\\n  s = a^3 + b^3 - 60ab(a + b)\\nis symmetric in a, b. Try simple small values and small offsets around 2012.\\nA very efficient trick is to look for patterns where a and b differ by 1, i.e., let b = a + 1. Then\\n  a^3 + (a + 1)^3 = a^3 + a^3 + 3a^2 + 3a + 1 = 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 3a + 1\\n  ab(a + b) = a(a + 1)(2a + 1)\\nCompute ab(a + b):\\n  a(a + 1)(2a + 1) = a(2a^2 + 3a + 1) = 2a^3 + 3a^2 + a\\nThen\\n  s = [2a^3 + 3a^2 + 3a + 1] - 60[2a^3 + 3a^2 + a]\\n    = 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 3a + 1 - (120a^3 + 180a^2 + 60a)\\n    = -118a^3 - 177a^2 - 57a + 1\\nThis is a cubic in a. For large positive a, s is large negative; for large negative a, s is large positive, so s crosses all large positive values and we can hit values above 2012 for some negative a.\\nWe now look for integer a such that s is just above 2012. For negative a, let a = -n with n > 0 and b = a + 1 = -n + 1.\\nSubstitute a = -n into s(a, a + 1):\\n  s = -118(-n)^3 - 177(-n)^2 - 57(-n) + 1\\n    = 118n^3 - 177n^2 + 57n + 1\\nDefine f(n) = 118n^3 - 177n^2 + 57n + 1.\\nWe need f(n) ≥ 2012 and want the smallest such value.\\nCheck small n:\\n n = 4:\\n  f(4) = 118·64 - 177·16 + 57·4 + 1\\n       = 7552 - 2832 + 228 + 1\\n       = 7552 - 2832 = 4720; 4720 + 228 = 4948; 4948 + 1 = 4949 (already > 2012)\\n n = 3:\\n  f(3) = 118·27 - 177·9 + 57·3 + 1\\n       = 3186 - 1593 + 171 + 1\\n       = 1593 + 171 + 1 = 1765 (less than 2012)\\nSo f(n) jumps from 1765 at n = 3 to 4949 at n = 4. That suggests there may be other (a, b) patterns giving s between 2012 and 4949, but this particular family overshoots quickly.\\nNext, try more general search patterns conceptually: because s is a polynomial in a and b with integer coefficients, the set of values is dense in the integers at large scale. To get close to 2012, it helps to look for cases where a + b is small so that (a + b)^3 is moderate relative to the 60ab(a + b) term.\\nLet x = a + b and y = ab. Then\\n  s = x^3 - 63xy\\nFor fixed x, s runs through values spaced by 63|x| as y varies over those integers realized as products of two integers summing to x. For a given x, y must satisfy the quadratic t^2 - xt + y = 0 having integer roots, so discriminant D = x^2 - 4y must be a perfect square. Thus y = (x^2 - D)/4 with D a nonnegative perfect square and D ≡ x^2 (mod 4).\\nThen\\n  s = x^3 - 63x·(x^2 - D)/4\\n    = x^3 - (63x^3)/4 + (63xD)/4\\n    = x^3(1 - 63/4) + (63xD)/4\\n    = (-59/4)x^3 + (63/4)xD\\nMultiply by 4 to clear denominators: 4s = -59x^3 + 63xD.\\nSince s is integer, 4s is divisible by 4 automatically; both sides are integers already, consistent.\\nTo find s near 2012, try small integer x and feasible D.\\nHowever, an easier route is to see if s can actually achieve 2012 exactly. That requires solving\\n  a^3 + b^3 - 60ab(a + b) = 2012.\\nWe can think in terms of x, y:\\n  x^3 - 63xy = 2012.\\nThen\\n  63xy = x^3 - 2012.\\nIf x = 0, left side 0, but then -2012 = 0 impossible. So x ≠ 0 and we get\\n  y = (x^3 - 2012)/(63x).\\nFor integer y, the numerator must be divisible by 63x. So 63x divides x^3 - 2012.\\nThis is quite restrictive for moderate x.\\nInstead of fully factoring, we can try bounding. For large |x|, x^3 dominates and s can be arbitrarily large positive or negative. The question is only what the smallest s ≥ 2012 is.\\nBecause the problem is from a contest-style context, often the minimum is achieved by small integers. We therefore test several small |x| cases and see the range of achievable s values.\\nRather than exhaustive search here, we can leverage a known trick for expressions of the form a^3 + b^3 - 3kab(a + b): they often factor once we introduce a change of variables. Try substituting a = u + v, b = u - v. Then\\n  a + b = 2u, ab = u^2 - v^2, and\\n  a^3 + b^3 = (u + v)^3 + (u - v)^3 = 2u^3 + 6uv^2.\\nCompute s:\\n  s = (2u^3 + 6uv^2) - 60(u^2 - v^2)(2u)\\n    = 2u^3 + 6uv^2 - 120u(u^2 - v^2)\\n    = 2u^3 + 6uv^2 - 120u^3 + 120uv^2\\n    = (2 - 120)u^3 + (6 + 120)uv^2\\n    = -118u^3 + 126uv^2\\nFactor out 2u:\\n  s = 2u(-59u^2 + 63v^2).\\nNow u, v are integers if and only if a and b have the same parity (since u = (a + b)/2, v = (a - b)/2). So we can realize all such s as\\n  s = 2u(-59u^2 + 63v^2), with u, v ∈ Z and a, b same parity.\\nThis representation is very helpful. We want s ≥ 2012. Note that s is even.\\nTry small |u| and vary v.\\nFor a fixed u ≠ 0, define\\n  s(u, v) = 2u(-59u^2 + 63v^2).\\nFor large |v|, the term 63v^2 dominates inside the parentheses and s has sign equal to sign(u). So for positive u, s can be made arbitrarily large positive by taking |v| large.\\nWe want the smallest s ≥ 2012, so we should look at small positive u.\\nCase u = 1:\\n  s(1, v) = 2·1(-59·1^2 + 63v^2) = 2(-59 + 63v^2) = -118 + 126v^2.\\nWe need s ≥ 2012:\\n  -118 + 126v^2 ≥ 2012\\n  126v^2 ≥ 2130\\n  v^2 ≥ 2130/126 = 355/21 ≈ 16.90\\nSo v^2 ≥ 17, so |v| ≥ 5.\\nCompute values:\\n v = 5: s = -118 + 126·25 = -118 + 3150 = 3032.\\n v = 4: s = -118 + 126·16 = -118 + 2016 = 1898 (too small).\\nThus, for u = 1, the achievable s values near our threshold are 1898 and 3032; 1898 < 2012, 3032 > 2012. So in this family, the minimum s ≥ 2012 is 3032.\\nCase u = 2:\\n  s(2, v) = 4(-59·4 + 63v^2) = 4(-236 + 63v^2) = -944 + 252v^2.\\nWe want s ≥ 2012:\\n  -944 + 252v^2 ≥ 2012\\n  252v^2 ≥ 2956\\n  v^2 ≥ 2956/252 ≈ 11.73\\nSo |v| ≥ 4.\\nCheck v = 4:\\n  s = -944 + 252·16 = -944 + 4032 = 3088.\\nCheck v = 3:\\n  s = -944 + 252·9 = -944 + 2268 = 1324 (too small).\\nSo for u = 2, the smallest s ≥ 2012 is 3088.\\nCase u = 3:\\n  s(3, v) = 6(-59·9 + 63v^2) = 6(-531 + 63v^2) = -3186 + 378v^2.\\nNeed:\\n  -3186 + 378v^2 ≥ 2012\\n  378v^2 ≥ 5198\\n  v^2 ≥ 5198/378 ≈ 13.74 → |v| ≥ 4.\\nCheck v = 4:\\n  s = -3186 + 378·16 = -3186 + 6048 = 2862.\\nCheck v = 3:\\n  s = -3186 + 378·9 = -3186 + 3402 = 216 (too small).\\nSo for u = 3, smallest s ≥ 2012 is 2862.\\nCase u = 4:\\n  s(4, v) = 8(-59·16 + 63v^2) = 8(-944 + 63v^2) = -7552 + 504v^2.\\nNeed:\\n  -7552 + 504v^2 ≥ 2012\\n  504v^2 ≥ 9564\\n  v^2 ≥ 9564/504 ≈ 18.97 → |v| ≥ 5.\\nCheck v = 5:\\n  s = -7552 + 504·25 = -7552 + 12600 = 5048.\\nCheck v = 4:\\n  s = -7552 + 504·16 = -7552 + 8064 = 512 (too small).\\nSo for u = 4, smallest s ≥ 2012 is 5048.\\nAs u grows, the leading term -118u^3 dictates that for moderate v, s is negative; only much larger v gives s positive, and then s grows quickly. The minimum s ≥ 2012 for each u grows as u grows. Thus, the global minimum s ≥ 2012 among integer a, b with same parity (which covers many integer pairs) must be among small u, and from u = 1, 2, 3, 4, the smallest candidate is 3032 from u = 1, v = 5.\\nWe must also consider a, b of opposite parity, which correspond to half-integer u or v in the substitution. However, we can directly inspect the original formula for such parity patterns.\\nOpposite parity means a + b is odd. Use x = a + b odd, y = ab integer, s = x^3 - 63xy. We again study small |x|.\\nBecause our earlier even-parity search already produced s = 3032, any smaller s ≥ 2012 must be ≤ 3030 or 3031. But s is always even in the even-parity case; for opposite parity, check parity of s:\\n  s = a^3 + b^3 - 60ab(a + b).\\nIf a + b is odd, then a and b have opposite parity, so ab is even. Then 60ab(a + b) is a multiple of 60·even·odd = multiple of 120, thus divisible by 8. Meanwhile, a^3 + b^3 with opposite parity is odd + even or even + odd = odd. So s ≡ odd - (multiple of 8). That can be odd or odd minus even; more precisely, s mod 2 = 1 - 0 = 1, so s is odd in this case. Therefore, any s from opposite-parity pairs is odd, while we want s just above 2012, which is even. The closest odd candidates would be 2013, 2015, 2017, etc., but they are all odd. Thus s cannot equal an even number like 2014 or 2016 for opposite parity; in particular, s cannot be 3032 - 1 = 3031 with opposite parity and then 3032 with even parity is currently the smallest even candidate.\\nTo be more precise, the parity argument shows: if a, b have opposite parity, then a^3 + b^3 is odd, 60ab(a + b) is even, and in fact ab is even, so 60ab(a + b) is a multiple of 120, still even, so s is odd. Thus even s values only arise from a, b same parity. Since 2012 is even, any s equal to 2012 + 2k must come from same-parity pairs. We already searched systematically for same-parity pairs via u, v and found the smallest s ≥ 2012 to be 3032. Therefore, there is no smaller even s ≥ 2012 achievable, and the minimum s satisfying the condition is 3032.\\nWe can exhibit explicit a, b: from u = 1, v = 5, we have\\n  a = u + v = 6, b = u - v = -4.\\nCheck directly:\\n  a^3 + b^3 = 6^3 + (-4)^3 = 216 - 64 = 152.\\n  ab(a + b) = (6)(-4)(2) = -48.\\n  -60ab(a + b) = -60·(-48) = 2880.\\nSo s = 152 + 2880 = 3032, confirming.\\nThus the answer to Problem 1 is 3032.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have a cubic polynomial\\n  p(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 333x - 1001,\\nwith roots a, b, c. We are asked to find a^3 + b^3 + c^3.\\nFrom Vieta's formulas for x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0 with roots a, b, c:\\n  a + b + c = -p,\\n  ab + bc + ca = q,\\n  abc = -r.\\nHere p = 1, q = -333, r = -1001, so\\n  a + b + c = -1,\\n  ab + bc + ca = -333,\\n  abc = 1001.\\nWe want S3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3.\\nUse the identity\\n  a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca).\\nFirst compute a^2 + b^2 + c^2 in terms of symmetric sums:\\n  (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca).\\nSo\\n  a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).\\nPlug values:\\n  a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (-1)^2 - 2(-333) = 1 + 666 = 667.\\nThen\\n  a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca = 667 - (-333) = 667 + 333 = 1000.\\nNow compute S3 - 3abc:\\n  S3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca)\\n             = (-1)(1000) = -1000.\\nSince abc = 1001, we have\\n  S3 - 3·1001 = -1000,\\n  S3 - 3003 = -1000,\\n  S3 = 3003 - 1000 = 2003.\\nSo a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 2003.\\n\\nFinal answers: Problem 1: 3032.
