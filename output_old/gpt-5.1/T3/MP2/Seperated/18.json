      "A401": "Trevor and Edward play a game in which they take turns adding or removing beans from a pile. On each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. The player who empties the pile wins. For example, if Trevor goes first with a pile of 5 beans, he can either add 4 to make the total 9, or remove 4 to make the total 1, and either way Edward wins by removing all the beans. There is no limit to how large the pile can grow; it just starts with some finite number of beans in it, say fewer than 1000. Before the game begins, Edward dispatches a spy to find out how many beans will be in the opening pile, call this $n$, then \"graciously\" offers to let Trevor go first. Knowing that the first player is more likely to win, but not knowing $n$, Trevor logically but unwisely accepts, and Edward goes on to win the game. Find a number $n$ less than 1000 that would prompt this scenario, assuming both players are perfect logicians. A correct answer is worth the nearest integer to $\\log _{2}(n-4)$ points."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe have a pile of n beans (<1000). On each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square ≤ current heap size. Let f(x) be that largest square. From state x>0, legal moves: x→x+f(x) or x→x−f(x) (if x>0; x−f(x)≥0 automatically since f(x)≤x). The player who moves to 0 wins. There is no upper cap on heap size.\\n\\nWe want some n<1000 such that:\\n- Both players are perfect (play optimally to win).\\n- Edward (second player) wins.\\n- Trevor believes \\\"the first player is more likely to win\\\" despite not knowing n.\\n- Edward secretly knows n beforehand (via spy) and \\\"graciously\\\" offers Trevor first move.\\n\\nThe natural interpretation: for this game, looking over all possible starting n<1000, more starting positions are first‑player wins (so first player is in general more likely to win), but the specific secret n is a losing position for the first player (a P‑position). Thus Trevor, not knowing n but knowing the general statistics or theory, is happy to be first, yet for this n the second player has a forced win.\\n\\nSo we must find at least one P‑position under optimal play, with n<1000. It's suggestive that small examples may already suffice. The problem even gives an explicit worked case: with n=5, they state that Trevor (first) loses and Edward wins. Let's verify that 5 is indeed losing for the first player under perfect play.\\n\\nCompute f(x) for small x:\\n1: f=1\\n2,3: f=1\\n4,5,6,7,8: f=4\\n9–15: f=9\\n16–24: f=16\\n25–35: f=25, etc.\\n\\nGame is impartial, normal-play, but not a standard subtraction game due to the + option; classic P/N analysis applies: a position is N (next player wins) if there is some legal move to a P (previous player wins) position; a position is P if all moves go to N positions. 0 is P, since the player to move has no moves and thus loses.\\n\\nWe only need to analyze n=5, but we should check all reachable states from 5 at least a layer deeper to ensure no hidden escape.\\n\\nWe proceed bottom-up for small x:\\n- x=0: terminal, losing for player to move ⇒ 0 is P.\\n- x=1: f(1)=1. Moves: 1→0 or 1→2.\\n  • 1→0 (P) so 1 is N.\\n- x=2: f(2)=1. Moves: 2→1 or 2→3.\\n  • 1 is N, 3 unknown yet, but if any move hits P, it’s N; currently only 1 (N) and some 3.\\n  • Need 3's status. So defer.\\n- x=3: f(3)=1. Moves: 3→2 or 3→4.\\n  Need 2,4.\\n- x=4: f(4)=4. Moves: 4→0 or 4→8.\\n  • 4→0 (P) ⇒ 4 is N.\\n\\nRevisit x=2,3 now that 4 is N:\\n- x=2: moves to 1 (N) and 3 (unknown). If 3 ends up N as well, then 2 is P; if 3 is P, 2 is N.\\n- x=3: moves to 2 (unknown) and 4 (N). If 2 is P, 3 is N; otherwise we continue.\\n\\nWe need consistency. Let's attempt a systematic approach using P/N definitions:\\nAssume for moment that 2 is P. Then 3 has move 3→2 (to P), so 3 is N. With 3=N, 2's moves go to 1 (N) and 3 (N), so 2 has no move to P, confirming 2 is P. This is self‑consistent. Thus:\\n0:P, 1:N, 2:P, 3:N, 4:N.\\n\\nNow analyze x=5, our candidate:\\n- f(5)=4. Moves: 5→5−4=1, and 5→5+4=9.\\nWe know 1 is N; we'll analyze 9.\\n\\nx=9: f(9)=9. Moves: 9→0 and 9→18.\\n- 9→0 (P), so 9 is N.\\nThat already suffices: both of 5's moves lead to N positions (1 and 9). Therefore 5 has no winning move and is a P-position. So:\\n- n=5: P-position, i.e., losing for the player who moves first, assuming perfect play.\\n\\nThis matches the problem’s given description: from 5, Trevor either goes to 1 or 9, and Edward then can immediately move to 0 (thus winning). Moreover, 5<1000, so n=5 is a valid answer. The problem only requests “a number n less than 1000 that would prompt this scenario”, not all such n.\\n\\nThus a simplest correct choice is n=5. The scoring expression is nearest integer to log_2(n−4) = log_2(1) = 0, but the score isn’t asked for; we just supply n.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have a tetrahedron (4 vertices, 4 faces, each face a triangle). We color each vertex red, blue, or green, with the condition: no face may have all three vertices the same color. So on each triangular face, the 3 vertices cannot be all identical. Two colorings are considered the same if a rotation of the tetrahedron maps one to the other (i.e., quotient by rotational symmetry group of the tetrahedron). We must count distinct colorings under this equivalence.\\n\\nStandard method: Burnside's Lemma on the rotational symmetry group of the tetrahedron (isomorphic to A_4, 12 elements). But the condition is simpler to handle directly via orbit counting; still, Burnside is straightforward.\\n\\nThe rotation group has 12 elements, split into:\\n- Identity: 1 element.\\n- Rotations about an axis through a vertex and the opposite face center: 8 elements (4 axes, and for each a rotation of 120° or 240°). These are 3-cycles on vertices.\\n- Rotations about an axis through midpoints of opposite edges: 3 elements (each is a 180° rotation). These are products of two disjoint transpositions on vertices.\\n\\nWe need the number of colorings fixed by each type, under the constraint that all faces avoid monochromatic triple.\\n\\nNotation: vertices 1,2,3,4; faces: (1,2,3), (1,2,4), (1,3,4), (2,3,4).\\n\\n1) Identity\\nEvery valid coloring is fixed by identity. So we must count all vertex colorings with 3 colors {R,B,G} and no face all same.\\nBrute‑force count: total unconstrained colorings = 3^4 = 81. Subtract those with at least one monochromatic face, and correct any double‑counting by inclusion‑exclusion.\\n\\nLet A_f be the set of colorings where face f is monochromatic.\\nFaces: f1=(1,2,3), f2=(1,2,4), f3=(1,3,4), f4=(2,3,4).\\n\\nWe want |valid| = 3^4 − |A_{f1} ∪ A_{f2} ∪ A_{f3} ∪ A_{f4}|.\\nBy inclusion‑exclusion:\\n|∪ A_f| = Σ|A_f| − Σ|A_f ∩ A_g| + Σ triple intersections − |all four|.\\n\\nCompute |A_f|:\\nTake f1 as example: vertices 1,2,3 same color (3 choices). Vertex 4 free (3 choices). So |A_f| = 3*3=9 for any face.\\nΣ|A_f| = 4*9 = 36.\\n\\nIntersections |A_f ∩ A_g|:\\nWe must check pairs:\\n- Adjacent faces share an edge (2 vertices); e.g., f1=(1,2,3) and f2=(1,2,4).\\n  Condition: vertices [1,2,3] identical, and [1,2,4] identical.\\n  From f1: 1=2=3=c; from f2: 1=2=4=c. Together: 1=2=3=4=c. So all four same color.\\n  Number of such colorings: 3.\\n  So for any adjacent face pair, intersection size=3.\\n- Opposite faces (sharing only one vertex) do not exist in tetrahedron; every pair shares at least an edge or is identical. Actually in tetrahedron any two distinct faces share an edge, so all 6 pairs are adjacent pairs.\\nThere are C(4,2)=6 pairs of faces; each pair intersection size 3.\\nSo Σ|A_f ∩ A_g| over distinct pairs = 6*3 = 18.\\n\\nTriple intersections |A_{f_i} ∩ A_{f_j} ∩ A_{f_k}|:\\nTake f1,f2,f3:\\n- f1 (1,2,3) same.\\n- f2 (1,2,4) same.\\n- f3 (1,3,4) same.\\nThen all four vertices must be the same color (since every vertex is tied into these equalities). So that intersection size=3.\\nSimilarly any triple of faces forces all 4 vertices the same color, hence size 3.\\nNumber of face triples: C(4,3)=4. So sum of triple intersections = 4*3=12.\\n\\nAll four faces intersection |A_{f1} ∩ A_{f2} ∩ A_{f3} ∩ A_{f4}|:\\nAll faces monochromatic ⇒ all 4 vertices same color ⇒ 3 colorings.\\n\\nNow inclusion‑exclusion:\\n|∪ A_f| = Σ|A_f| − Σ|pairs| + Σ|triples| − |all 4|\\n= 36 − 18 + 12 − 3 = 27.\\nThus |valid| = 81 − 27 = 54.\\nSo there are 54 vertex colorings satisfying the face constraint, before modding out by rotations.\\n\\nThus the number fixed by identity = 54.\\n\\n2) 120° and 240° rotations about vertex–face axes (3-cycles)\\nPick axis through vertex 1 and center of opposite face (2,3,4). A 120° rotation cycles vertices (2,3,4) and keeps 1 fixed. Up to conjugacy, all 8 nontrivial 120°/240° rotations act similarly (one fixed vertex, one 3-cycle).\\n\\nWe must count colorings invariant under such a rotation AND satisfying the face constraint.\\n\\nCondition for a coloring to be invariant under a 3-cycle (say (2 3 4)):\\n- Vertices 2,3,4 must have same color, call it c.\\n- Vertex 1 may be any color, call it d.\\nThus orbits: {1} and {2,3,4}. 3 choices for c, 3 choices for d. So naively 3*3=9 invariant colorings.\\nNow we must ensure no face is monochromatic.\\n\\nFaces:\\n- f1=(1,2,3): colors (d,c,c).\\n- f2=(1,2,4): (d,c,c).\\n- f3=(1,3,4): (d,c,c).\\n- f4=(2,3,4): (c,c,c).\\n\\nThe face (2,3,4) is always monochromatic (c,c,c), regardless of c,d. That violates the constraint. So no invariant coloring under such a rotation is valid, except possibly if that face were allowed, but it is not. Therefore:\\nNumber of valid colorings fixed by any 3-cycle rotation = 0.\\nAll 8 such rotations have 0 fixed valid colorings.\\n\\n3) 180° rotations about edge-midpoint axes (double transpositions)\\nEach 180° rotation swaps two vertex pairs. Example: a rotation swapping 1↔2 and 3↔4 (permutation (1 2)(3 4)). There are 3 such rotations corresponding to 3 pairs of opposite edges.\\n\\nFor a coloring to be invariant under (1 2)(3 4):\\n- Vertices 1 and 2 must share a color: let a.\\n- Vertices 3 and 4 must share a color: let b.\\nThus 3 choices for a, 3 for b, total 9 colorings invariant under this rotation.\\nWe must count those satisfying the face constraint.\\n\\nLet’s analyze faces for this pattern (a,a,b,b):\\n- f1=(1,2,3): (a,a,b).\\n- f2=(1,2,4): (a,a,b).\\n- f3=(1,3,4): (a,b,b).\\n- f4=(2,3,4): (a,b,b).\\n\\nA face is monochromatic only if all three vertices same color.\\nFor f1 and f2: they are (a,a,b). For them to be monochromatic, we'd need a=b. If a=b, then all four vertices share same color, and indeed every face would be monochromatic. So a=b is forbidden.\\nFor f3 and f4: they are (a,b,b). Also monochromatic iff a=b.\\nTherefore, the face constraint is satisfied exactly when a≠b.\\nThus valid fixed colorings under this rotation: choose a,b in {R,B,G} with a≠b.\\nNumber of ordered pairs (a,b) with a≠b over 3 colors: 3*2=6.\\nSo this 180° rotation fixes 6 valid colorings.\\nBy symmetry, each of the 3 180° rotations has exactly 6 fixed valid colorings.\\n\\nBurnside's Lemma:\\nNumber of distinct colorings up to rotation = (1/|G|) * Σ_g (number of valid colorings fixed by g), where |G|=12.\\n\\nWe have:\\n- Identity (1 element): 54 fixed.\\n- 120°/240° rotations (8 elements): 0 each ⇒ contribution 0.\\n- 180° rotations (3 elements): 6 each ⇒ total 18.\\n\\nSum of fixed counts = 54 + 0 + 18 = 72.\\nDivide by 12: 72/12 = 6.\\n\\nSo there are 6 distinct vertex-colorings of a tetrahedron with colors {R,B,G} obeying the constraint that no face is monochromatic.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: n=5.\\nProblem 2: 6.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
