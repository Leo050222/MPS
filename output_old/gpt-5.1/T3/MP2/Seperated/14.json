For any prime p:\\n- If p = 3, then p^2 ≡ 0 (mod 3).\\n- If p ≠ 3, then p^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\\nAlso, 16 ≡ 1 (mod 3), so 16c^2 ≡ c^2 (mod 3).\\n\\nRight-hand side: 9k^2 + 1 ≡ 0 + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\\nTherefore we need\\n  a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\\nEach term is 0 or 1 mod 3, so we must avoid the sum being 0 or 2 mod 3.\\nPossible (a^2 mod 3, b^2 mod 3, c^2 mod 3) with sum 1:\\n- (1, 0, 0)\\n- (0, 1, 0)\\n- (0, 0, 1)\\n- (1, 1, 2) impossible since 2 not a quadratic residue mod 3.\\nSo exactly one of a, b, c is not divisible by 3 (≡1 mod 3), and the other two are ≡0 mod 3 (i.e., equal to 3 since prime), or all three are 0 with a 1 somewhere, but since only 0,1 are allowed, we get specifically:\\n- Either a = 3, b = 3, c ≠ 3 (so c ≡ ±1 mod 3), or\\n- a = 3, c = 3, b ≠ 3, or\\n- b = 3, c = 3, a ≠ 3.\\nThere is no solution with none equal to 3, because that would give 1+1+1 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\n\\n2) Refine with structure.\\nCase 1: a = b = 3, c ≠ 3.\\nEquation becomes:\\n  9 + 9 + 16c^2 = 9k^2 + 1\\n  16c^2 + 18 = 9k^2 + 1\\n  16c^2 + 17 = 9k^2\\nSo 9 divides 16c^2 + 17.\\nCompute 16c^2 + 17 (mod 9): 16 ≡ 7 (mod 9), so expression ≡ 7c^2 + 8 (mod 9).\\nSquares mod 9: 0,1,4,7.\\nThen 7c^2 (mod 9) can be 7·0=0, 7·1=7, 7·4=28≡1, 7·7=49≡4. So 7c^2 ≡ 0,1,4,7.\\nAdd 8: possible residues 8,0,3,6 (mod 9). Zero occurs when 7c^2 ≡ 1 (mod 9), i.e. when c^2 ≡ 4 (mod 9). That means c ≡ 2 or 7 (or 5) mod 9, precisely those with square 4 mod 9. So the congruence is solvable.\\nSet 16c^2 + 17 = 9k^2. Rearranged:\\n  9k^2 -16c^2 = 17.\\nThis is a Pell-type equation: 9k^2 - 16c^2 = 17.\\nRewrite as:\\n  (3k)^2 - (4c)^2 = 17\\n  (3k - 4c)(3k + 4c) = 17.\\nBecause 17 is prime, the integer factor pairs are (1,17) and (−1,−17). So we get\\n  3k - 4c = 1,\\n  3k + 4c = 17.\\nAdding: 6k = 18 → k = 3.\\nThen 3k - 4c = 1 gives 9 - 4c = 1 → 4c = 8 → c = 2.\\nThe negative pair yields k = −3, c = −2, which we discard since c, k > 0.\\nThus the unique positive-integer solution in this case is (a,b,c,k) = (3,3,2,3).\\nCheck primality: 3,3,2 are prime. This satisfies the conditions.\\n\\nCase 2: a = 3, c = 3, b ≠ 3.\\nEquation:\\n  9 + b^2 + 16·9 = 9k^2 + 1\\n  b^2 + 153 = 9k^2 + 1\\n  b^2 + 152 = 9k^2.\\nSo 9k^2 - b^2 = 152.\\nFactor:\\n  (3k - b)(3k + b) = 152.\\nHere 3k − b and 3k + b are positive integers, same parity, and their product is 152 = 2^3·19.\\nLet 3k − b = d1, 3k + b = d2 with d1d2 = 152, d2 > d1, and d1, d2 same parity.\\nThen k = (d1 + d2)/6, b = (d2 − d1)/2.\\nWe also need b to be prime.\\nList factor pairs (d1,d2) of 152 with same parity:\\n(1,152) (odd, even) – discard.\\n(2,76) both even → k = (2+76)/6 = 78/6 = 13; b = (76−2)/2 = 74/2 = 37, which is prime. So (k,b) = (13,37).\\n(4,38) → k = 42/6 = 7; b = (38−4)/2 = 34/2 = 17, prime. So (k,b) = (7,17).\\n(8,19) (even, odd) – discard.\\nThus we get two solutions:\\n  (a,b,c,k) = (3,37,3,13) and (3,17,3,7).\\nBy symmetry we also get b=3, c=3, a≠3, leading to (a,b,c,k) = (37,3,3,13) and (17,3,3,7).\\n\\nCase 3: b = 3, c ≠ 3, a = 3.\\nThis is the same as Case 1 by swapping a and b, already counted.\\n\\nCase 4: c = 3, a and b not both 3 simultaneously.\\nWe already covered when c=3 and exactly one of a,b is 3 in Case 2 and its symmetric version. The possibility with neither a nor b equal to 3 is impossible mod 3 because then a^2 ≡ b^2 ≡ 1, c^2 ≡ 0, so a^2 + b^2 + 16c^2 ≡ 1+1+0 ≡ 2 (mod 3), which contradicts RHS ≡ 1.\\n\\nTherefore, the complete set of solutions in primes a,b,c with positive k is the union of:\\n- (a,b,c,k) = (3,3,2,3)\\n- (a,b,c,k) = (3,17,3,7)\\n- (a,b,c,k) = (17,3,3,7)\\n- (a,b,c,k) = (3,37,3,13)\\n- (a,b,c,k) = (37,3,3,13).\\n\\nThese are all permutations that satisfy the modular and factorization constraints.\\n\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe seek the smallest n such that n! ends in exactly 290 zeroes, i.e. v_10(n!) = 290, where v_10(n!) is the exponent of 10 in n!. Since 10 = 2·5 and there are more factors of 2 than 5, we just need the exponent of 5 in n!:\\n  v_5(n!) = sum_{k>=1} floor(n / 5^k).\\nWe want v_5(n!) = 290.\\n\\nFirst find the smallest n with v_5(n!) ≥ 290.\\nCompute for some candidates:\\nTake n = 5·290 = 1450 as a rough upper bound.\\nRefine:\\nTry n = 1200.\\nv_5(1200) = floor(1200/5) + floor(1200/25) + floor(1200/125) + floor(1200/625) + floor(1200/3125)...\\n= 240 + 48 + 9 + 1 + 0 = 298.\\nSo v_5(1200!) = 298 > 290, so we need smaller n.\\nTry n = 1150.\\nv_5(1150) = floor(1150/5) + floor(1150/25) + floor(1150/125) + floor(1150/625)\\n= 230 + 46 + 9 + 1 = 286.\\nSo v_5(1150!) = 286 < 290.\\nWe now search between 1151 and 1200.\\nEvaluate successive n, but more efficiently we note that v_5 only increases when n crosses multiples of 5.\\nCheck multiples of 5 in (1150,1200]: 1155, 1160, 1165, 1170, 1175, 1180, 1185, 1190, 1195, 1200.\\nWe already computed 1150 → 286.\\nAt n=1155:\\n floor(1155/5)=231, floor(1155/25)=46, floor(1155/125)=9, floor(1155/625)=1 → total 231+46+9+1=287.\\nAt n=1160:\\n 232 + 46 + 9 + 1 = 288.\\nAt n=1165:\\n 233 + 46 + 9 + 1 = 289.\\nAt n=1170:\\n 234 + 46 + 9 + 1 = 290.\\nSo v_5(1170!) = 290.\\nWe must ensure that 1170 is the smallest n with v_5(n!) = 290. From 1150 to 1169 we saw that the value steps 286→287→288→289 and only at n=1170 does it reach 290. For n < 1170, the maximum achieved is 289 (at n from 1165 to 1169), so none of those have 290 trailing zeros.\\nThus the smallest n with 290 trailing zeros in n! is 1170.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\n- Problem 1: All prime triples (a,b,c) with positive k:\\n  (3,3,2; 3), (3,17,3; 7), (17,3,3; 7), (3,37,3; 13), (37,3,3; 13).\\n- Problem 2: n = 1170.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"(a,b,c,k) in {(3,3,2,3),(3,17,3,7),(17,3,3,7),(3,37,3,13),(37,3,3,13)}\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1170\"\n}",
