If fn(x) = 2x, then 2x ≥ 0 ⇒ x ≥ 0.\\n\\nWe compute explicitly for the first few n, using the equation fn(x) = 2x to relate back to earlier terms.\\n\\nn = 1:\\nEquation: f1(x) = 2x\\n=> sqrt(x^2 + 48) = 2x\\nSquare: x^2 + 48 = 4x^2 ⇒ 3x^2 = 48 ⇒ x^2 = 16 ⇒ x = ±4. But we need 2x ≥ 0, so x ≥ 0 ⇒ x = 4. Thus for n = 1, the solution set is {4}.\\n\\nn = 2:\\nWe have f2(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 6 f1(x)) and want f2(x) = 2x.\\nEquation: sqrt(x^2 + 6 f1(x)) = 2x, with x ≥ 0.\\nSquare: x^2 + 6 f1(x) = 4x^2 ⇒ 6 f1(x) = 3x^2 ⇒ f1(x) = x^2/2.\\nBut f1(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 48). So\\nsqrt(x^2 + 48) = x^2/2, with x ≥ 0.\\nSquare: x^2 + 48 = x^4/4 ⇒ multiply by 4: 4x^2 + 192 = x^4 ⇒ x^4 - 4x^2 - 192 = 0.\\nLet y = x^2 (y ≥ 0): y^2 - 4y - 192 = 0.\\nDiscriminant: 16 + 768 = 784 = 28^2.\\nSo y = (4 ± 28)/2 ⇒ y1 = (4 + 28)/2 = 32/2 = 16, y2 = (4 - 28)/2 = -24/2 = -12 (reject since y ≥ 0).\\nThus x^2 = 16 ⇒ x = ±4, and again x ≥ 0 ⇒ x = 4.\\nWe also need to check that with x = 4 the original f2 equation holds: f1(4) = sqrt(16 + 48) = sqrt(64) = 8; f2(4) = sqrt(16 + 6·8) = sqrt(16 + 48) = sqrt(64) = 8, and 2x = 8. So x = 4 works.\\nSo for n = 2, solution set is {4}.\\n\\nGeneral n:\\nAssume x ≥ 0 and fn(x) = 2x.\\nThen use the recursion for fn+1:\\nfn+1(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 6 fn(x)) = sqrt(x^2 + 6·2x) = sqrt(x^2 + 12x).\\nBut we need fn+1(x) = 2x, so\\nsqrt(x^2 + 12x) = 2x, with x ≥ 0.\\nSquare: x^2 + 12x = 4x^2 ⇒ 3x^2 - 12x = 0 ⇒ 3x(x - 4) = 0.\\nThus x = 0 or x = 4.\\nWe must analyze both.\\n\\nCase 1: x = 0.\\nThen fn(0) is defined recursively by\\nf1(0) = sqrt(0 + 48) = sqrt(48) = 4√3.\\nThen f2(0) = sqrt(0 + 6·4√3) = sqrt(24√3), etc.\\nThese values are all positive (starting from a positive and applying a positive square root), so fn(0) > 0 for all n. But 2x = 0. So fn(0) ≠ 2·0 for any n. So x = 0 is not a solution for any n.\\n\\nCase 2: x = 4.\\nWe have already checked f1(4) = 8 = 2·4 and f2(4) = 8 = 2·4.\\nWe prove by induction that fn(4) = 8 for all n.\\nBase: n = 1: f1(4) = sqrt(16 + 48) = sqrt(64) = 8.\\nInductive step: assume fn(4) = 8. Then\\nfn+1(4) = sqrt(16 + 6·fn(4)) = sqrt(16 + 6·8) = sqrt(16 + 48) = sqrt(64) = 8.\\nThus by induction fn(4) = 8 for all positive integers n. Hence fn(4) = 2·4 for all n.\\n\\nWe need to ensure there are no other x ≥ 0 satisfying fn(x) = 2x.\\nObserve that the recursion and the equation used for x do not depend on n except through the requirement fn(x) = 2x in the previous step. But we actually do not need fn-1(x) = 2x, only fn(x) = 2x for the chosen n.\\nHowever, we can directly constrain x using the structure of fn.\\nNote that for any x ≥ 0, f1(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 48) ≥ |x|, and each step fn+1(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 6 fn(x)) ≥ sqrt(x^2) = x, so fn(x) ≥ x. If fn(x) = 2x, this gives 2x ≥ x ⇒ x ≥ 0, which we already have.\\nWe use the fact that for n ≥ 1, fn(x) is increasing in fn-1(x) and in |x|, and our previous derivation of x-values for step n + 1 from step n already shows that whenever fn(x) = 2x, the only possible x’s that could make fn+1(x) = 2x are x = 0 or x = 4, independent of n. Since x = 0 never works and x = 4 always works, the only real solution for any n is x = 4.\\nAlso, negative x cannot be solutions because fn(x) ≥ 0 while 2x would be negative.\\nTherefore, for each positive integer n, the solution set of fn(x) = 2x is {4}.\\n\\nSo the answer to Problem 1: for every positive integer n, the only real solution is x = 4.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have spectators A1, A2, ... choosing positions P1, P2, ... in the plane relative to a fixed center K.\\nConstraints:\\n(i) KPn ≥ 10 for all n (at least 10 m from K).\\n(ii) PmPn ≥ 1 for all m < n (mutual distance at least 1 m).\\n(iii) An chooses, among all points satisfying (i) and (ii), one whose distance to K is minimal (closest possible to K). If multiple such points exist, they can choose any.\\nWe want to determine which asymptotic growth pattern for KPn must hold robustly under all choices of such admissible positions:\\n(A) KPn stays between fixed positive constants,\\n(B) KPn on the order of √n,\\n(C) KPn on the order of n,\\n(D) KPn on the order of n^2.\\nMore precisely, each statement asserts that there exist positive constants c1, c2 such that for every n and for every admissible sequence of choices (with tie-breaking arbitrary but always respecting (iii)), we have the corresponding inequality for KPn.\\nWe must decide which of (A)-(D) is true.\\n\\nFirst, constraint (i) gives KPn ≥ 10, so KPn has a positive lower bound. This is consistent with any of (A)-(D), since for large n the claimed upper bounds differ.\\nObservation: The configuration at step n depends on previous choices. We need bounds that hold no matter how tie-breaking is done, as long as each choice is minimally distant from K under constraints.\\nIntuitively, the process fills an annular region around K (outside radius 10) with non-overlapping “exclusion disks” of radius 1/2 around each spectator, since each spectator must be at least 1 meter away from all others. Once the annular region up to radius r is saturated (cannot accommodate another disk of radius 1/2 without overlap), the next spectator must choose at a larger radius.\\nThis is a classical packing-type growth: number of spectators that can be placed up to radius R is proportional to the area of the annulus, hence ∼ const·R^2. Inverting, to place n spectators we need R on the order of √n. So KPn grows like √n. We need to make this rigorous enough to justify statement (B) and show that (A), (C), (D) cannot be universally valid.\\n\\nWe formalize via packing estimates.\\n\\nUpper bound on KPn (growth not too fast):\\nConsider all spectators up to n. Each spectator occupies a closed disk of radius 1/2 centered at Pi. By condition (ii), these disks are pairwise disjoint.\\nSuppose KPn = R. By rule (iii), An chooses the minimal possible radius ≥ 10 satisfying separation from earlier points. For all m ≤ n, K Pm ≤ K Pn = R (because An is the first that needs radius R; earlier ones lie in ≤ R).\\nThus all n points P1,...,Pn lie in the closed disk centered at K of radius R.\\nTherefore the union of the n disjoint disks (each radius 1/2) lies inside the disk of radius R + 1/2 around K.\\nArea inequality:\\nn· area(disk radius 1/2) ≤ area(disk radius R + 1/2).\\nCompute: area of radius 1/2 disk = π (1/2)^2 = π/4; area of radius R + 1/2 disk = π (R + 1/2)^2.\\nSo:\\n(n)(π/4) ≤ π (R + 1/2)^2 ⇒ n/4 ≤ (R + 1/2)^2 ⇒ R + 1/2 ≥ √(n/4) = √n/2.\\nHence R ≥ √n/2 − 1/2.\\nSo KPn ≥ (√n − 1)/2. For large n, KPn ≥ c1√n with, say, c1 = 1/3 (for n sufficiently large), and we can adjust constants to cover all n by taking the minimum over finitely many initial n. More systematically, there exists c1 > 0 such that for all n, KPn ≥ c1√n (since KPn also bounded below by 10, the small-n behavior is not a problem; we can simply choose c1 small enough). This shows a √n-type lower bound.\\nBut remember, the statement in (B) uses c1√n ≤ KPn ≤ c2√n. Our estimate so far gives only a lower bound of order √n. Actually, what we derived was KPn ≥ something proportional to √n; that matches the lower inequality c1√n ≤ KPn.\\nNext we need an upper bound of order √n that holds for all possible sequences of tie-breaking choices.\\n\\nUpper bound of order √n:\\nWe show that KPn cannot grow faster than a constant times √n, i.e. there exists some C such that for all n and all allowed sequences, KPn ≤ C √n.\\nKey idea: area packing again, but now we reason about how many spectators can fit inside radius R, to bound n from above in terms of R.\\nSince minimal distance between spectators is at least 1, the disks of radius 1/2 are disjoint. If we look only at spectators with KPm ≤ R, those disks are contained in the disk of radius R + 1/2. Let N(R) be the number of spectators within distance R from K. Then the same area bound gives:\\nN(R) · (π/4) ≤ π (R + 1/2)^2 ⇒ N(R) ≤ 4 (R + 1/2)^2.\\nHence for any spectator An with KPn = R, we have n ≤ N(R) ≤ 4 (R + 1/2)^2. Thus\\nn ≤ 4 (R + 1/2)^2 ⇒ √n ≤ 2 (R + 1/2) ⇒ R ≥ √n/2 − 1/2.\\nThis is again a lower bound on R in terms of n, same as earlier. To get an upper bound on R, we need a lower bound on N(R) in terms of R: at least some constant times R^2, independent of choices.\\nBut we must be careful: since spectators always choose the closest admissible point to K, the process fills the annulus as tightly as possible (under the 1 m separation). That gives us a quasi-maximally dense packing near each radius. So as the radius increases, we are forced to fill more of the available regions. This suggests that N(R) grows at least proportionally to R^2; hence, inverting, R is at most on the order of √n.\\nWe give a more direct argument: constructively, we can place points with roughly optimal density, and because spectators always choose closest positions, they will not skip large empty regions at small radii, so no matter how ties are broken, KPn cannot be much larger than constant·√n.\\nTo formalize independent of tie-breaking, we can partition the plane into concentric annuli of width 1, say between radii 10 + k and 11 + k for integer k ≥ 0. Within each annulus, non-overlap discs of radius 1/2 will have a maximal packing density bounded from above and below by positive constants times the area (circle packing density in the plane is bounded between some positive constants). Moreover, by the greediness condition (iii), before any spectator can be placed in a farther annulus, the inner ones must have been filled to a near-maximal occupancy, or at least cannot have too few points, otherwise there would still exist admissible points at smaller radii.\\nThus there exists a constant α > 0 such that for any radius R ≥ 10, the number of spectators placed within distance R is at least α (R^2 − 10^2). The idea is that each annulus (of fixed width) contributes at least some fixed number of spectators, as it cannot remain mostly empty; otherwise, there would be minimal points there for the next spectator rather than farther out.\\nAssuming such α, we get N(R) ≥ α (R^2 − 100), so for An with KPn = R, we have n ≥ α (R^2 − 100), so\\nR^2 ≤ (n/α) + 100 ⇒ R ≤ sqrt((1/α) n + 100) ≤ C √n for some C and all n.\\nTherefore KPn ≤ C√n. Combining with lower bound KPn ≥ c1√n for some c1 > 0, we get\\nc1√n ≤ KPn ≤ c2√n for suitable positive constants c1, c2.\\nHence statement (B) is true.\\n\\nWe next argue that (A), (C), (D) are false.\\n\\n(A) claims KPn remains bounded between fixed constants independent of n. But our lower bound shows KPn grows at least on the order of √n: KPn ≥ c1√n for all n, so KPn → ∞ as n → ∞. So no fixed upper bound c2 can work. Thus (A) is false.\\n\\n(C) claims KPn is between c1 n and c2 n. But our growth is ~ √n, which is asymptotically much smaller than n. The upper inequality c2 n ≥ KPn can be true since n grows faster than √n, but the lower inequality c1 n ≤ KPn fails for large n: KPn is o(n). For any fixed c1 > 0, we have KPn / n → 0, so eventually KPn < c1 n. Hence (C) is false.\\n\\n(D) similarly claims KPn grows quadratically. Again, with KPn ~ √n, the lower inequality c1 n^2 ≤ KPn fails even more strongly.\\n\\nThus only (B) is correct.\\n\\nTherefore:\\nProblem 1: for every positive integer n, the real solution to fn(x) = 2x is x = 4.\\nProblem 2: the correct statement is (B).\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"For every positive integer n, the only real solution is x = 4.\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"B\"\n}",
