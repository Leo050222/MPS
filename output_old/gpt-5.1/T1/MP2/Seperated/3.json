Problem 2: Distance is 100 m. Megan's speed is 5/4 m/s. Her time is distance/speed = 100 / (5/4) = 100 * (4/5) = 80 seconds. Hana finishes 5 seconds earlier, so Hana's time is 80 - 5 = 75 seconds. Hana's average speed is distance/time = 100 / 75 = 4/3 m/s after simplifying the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 25.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"104\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4/3\"\n}",
