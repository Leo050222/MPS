  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let the number of skateboards be S and the number of bicycles be B. We know S:B = 7:4 and S = B + 12. From the ratio, set S = 7k and B = 4k for some positive number k. Then S − B = 7k − 4k = 3k. We are told S − B = 12, so 3k = 12, which gives k = 4. Substitute back: S = 7k = 7 × 4 = 28 and B = 4k = 4 × 4 = 16. The total number of skateboards and bicycles is S + B = 28 + 16 = 44.\\n\\nProblem 2: Shuxin starts with 10 red, 7 yellow, and 3 blue candies. She eats some candies, so the remaining numbers of red, yellow, and blue are all equal to the same number x. Since she can only remove (eat) candies, x must be less than or equal to each starting count: x ≤ 3, because there are only 3 blue candies to begin with. Also, she does not have to eat all candies of a color, so x can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. We need the smallest possible total eaten, so we want to maximize x. The largest x that works is x = 3 because 3 ≤ 3 (blue), 3 ≤ 7 (yellow), and 3 ≤ 10 (red). Then remaining candies: 3 red, 3 yellow, 3 blue. Candies eaten: red eaten = 10 − 3 = 7, yellow eaten = 7 − 3 = 4, blue eaten = 3 − 3 = 0. Total eaten = 7 + 4 + 0 = 11. If x were smaller, more candies would be eaten, which is not minimal. Therefore, the smallest possible number of candies Shuxin ate is 11.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"44\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
