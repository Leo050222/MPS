  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let the three consecutive integers be n, n+1, and n+2. Their sum is n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3. We are told this equals 27, so 3n + 3 = 27. Subtract 3 from both sides: 3n = 24. Divide by 3: n = 8. The three integers are 8, 9, and 10. Their product is 8 × 9 × 10 = (8 × 9) × 10 = 72 × 10 = 720.\\n\\nProblem 2: We are told x% of 60 is 12. Convert x% to a decimal: x% = x/100. Then (x/100) × 60 = 12. Simplify: (60x)/100 = 12 → (3x)/5 = 12 (dividing numerator and denominator by 20). Multiply both sides by 5: 3x = 60. Divide by 3: x = 20. We need 15% of x, i.e., (15/100) × x = (15/100) × 20. Simplify: 20/100 = 1/5, so this is 15 × (1/5) = 3.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"720\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
