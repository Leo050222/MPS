Let the original price be P.\\n20% off means the sale price is 80% of the original: 0.8P = 112.\\nSolve for P: P = 112 / 0.8 = 112 ÷ (8/10) = 112 × (10/8) = 112 × (5/4).\\nCompute 112 × (5/4): 112 ÷ 4 = 28, then 28 × 5 = 140.\\nSo the original price is $140.\\nIf the item is 30% off, the sale price is 70% of the original: 0.7 × 140.\\nCompute 0.7 × 140: 7 × 14 = 98, so the sale price is $98.\\nThus, under a 30% discount, the MP3 player would sell for 98.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have (x + m)(x + n) equal to a quadratic in x with constant term -12.\\nExpand: (x + m)(x + n) = x^2 + (m + n)x + mn.\\nThe constant term is mn, and we are told it is -12. So mn = -12, with m and n integers.\\nWe need to find which value cannot be m, given mn = -12 and n is also an integer.\\nList all integer factor pairs of -12 (ordered pairs (m, n)):\\n1) m = 1,  n = -12  → mn = -12\\n2) m = -1, n = 12   → mn = -12\\n3) m = 2,  n = -6   → mn = -12\\n4) m = -2, n = 6    → mn = -12\\n5) m = 3,  n = -4   → mn = -12\\n6) m = -3, n = 4    → mn = -12\\n7) m = 4,  n = -3   → mn = -12\\n8) m = -4, n = 3    → mn = -12\\n6, -6, 12, and -12 also appear as possible n values in these pairs, but for m itself, the only possible integer values (from all pairs) are: 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 4, -4.\\nAny integer not in this set cannot be m, e.g., 5 cannot be m because there is no integer n such that 5n = -12.\\nThus, among typical answer choices, the one that cannot be m is 5.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"98\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"5\"\n}",
