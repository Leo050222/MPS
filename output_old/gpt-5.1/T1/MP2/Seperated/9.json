We know the final output is 32. Work backwards. Just before adding 16, the value must be 32 − 16 = 16. That value comes from dividing by 2, so the value before division by 2 must be 16 × 2 = 32. That value comes from subtracting 8 from the input, so x − 8 = 32. Solve: x = 32 + 8 = 40. So the INPUT is 40.\\n\\nProblem 2: The original line is y = x + 4, which has y-intercept 4. Translating a graph down 6 units subtracts 6 from all y-values, so the new equation becomes y = x + 4 − 6 = x − 2. The y-intercept of the new line is −2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"40\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-2\"\n}",
