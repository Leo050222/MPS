  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We want to maximize xy given x + y = 31 with x, y positive integers. For real numbers with fixed sum S, the product xy is maximized when x = y = S/2. Here S = 31, so the ideal real solution is x = y = 31/2 = 15.5. Since x and y must be integers, the best we can do is choose x and y as close as possible: 15 and 16. Then xy = 15 * 16 = 240. To verify this is maximal among integers, note that if we set x = 15 + k and y = 16 - k (so x + y = 31 still), the product is (15 + k)(16 - k) = 240 - k^2, which is largest when k = 0, giving 240. Thus the largest possible product is 240.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) on the line segment joining (-9, -2) and (6, 8). For a segment from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2), the number of lattice points on the segment (including both endpoints) is gcd(|x2 - x1|, |y2 - y1|) + 1. Here, x1 = -9, y1 = -2, x2 = 6, y2 = 8. Compute the differences: |x2 - x1| = |6 - (-9)| = |15| = 15; |y2 - y1| = |8 - (-2)| = |10| = 10. Now gcd(15, 10) = 5. Therefore, the number of lattice points on the line segment is 5 + 1 = 6.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"240\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
