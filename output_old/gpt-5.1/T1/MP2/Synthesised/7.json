  "math_problem": "What is the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region if a circular spinner is divided into six regions, four regions each have a central angle of $x^{\\circ}$, and the remaining regions have central angles of $20^{\\circ}$ and $140^{\\circ}$, where the shaded regions consist of the $140^{\\circ}$ region and two of the $x^{\\circ}$ regions? Instead of computing the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region, simply find $N = \\theta + 2700$, where $\\theta$ is the total central angle in degrees of the shaded regions. We call the pair $(m, n)$ of positive integers a happy pair if the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is a perfect square. For example, $(20, 24)$ is a happy pair because the greatest common divisor of 20 and 24 is 4. Suppose that $k$ is a positive integer such that $(205800, 35k)$ is a happy pair. What is the number of possible values of $k$ with $k \\leq N$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"1) The spinner is a full circle, so the sum of all central angles is 360°. There are four regions of x°, plus 20° and 140°, so: 4x + 20 + 140 = 360 → 4x + 160 = 360 → 4x = 200 → x = 50.\\n2) The shaded regions are the 140° region and two of the x° regions. Thus θ = 140 + 2x = 140 + 2·50 = 240.\\n3) N = θ + 2700 = 240 + 2700 = 2940.\\n4) A pair (m, n) is happy if gcd(m, n) is a perfect square. We are given (205800, 35k) is happy.\\n5) Let d = gcd(205800, 35k). Then d divides both 205800 and 35k, so d is a common divisor of 205800 and 35k.\\n6) First compute g = gcd(205800, 35). Factor: 205800 = 2058 · 100 = (2·3·7·7·7)·(2²·5²) = 2³·3·5²·7³; 35 = 5·7. Thus gcd(205800, 35) = 5·7 = 35.\\n7) Any common divisor of 205800 and 35k must divide gcd(205800, 35k) = gcd(205800, 35) · possibly something from k that is coprime to 205800/35. But since 205800/35 is an integer coprime to 35, the gcd with 35k cannot pick up any new prime beyond 5 and 7 from the 35 part. So every common divisor of 205800 and 35k is of the form 5^a 7^b with 0 ≤ a ≤ 2, 0 ≤ b ≤ 3.\\n8) Therefore d = gcd(205800, 35k) is always a divisor of 35 and hence of the form 5^a 7^b with a, b ∈ {0,1}. So the only possible gcd values are 1, 5, 7, 35.\\n9) A perfect square among these is only 1. So gcd(205800, 35k) must be 1 for (205800, 35k) to be a happy pair.\\n10) gcd(205800, 35k) = 1 implies no prime factor 5 or 7 can divide both 205800 and 35k. Since 205800 and 35 are both divisible by 5 and 7, we need k to eliminate these factors from the gcd. The only way is to require that 5 and 7 do not divide k; then 35k has the same 5 and 7 factors as 35, but 205800 already has them, so the gcd still contains 5 and 7. Hence in fact, as noted, the gcd cannot be 1 if both numbers share 5 and 7.\\n11) Re-examining: 205800 and 35 share 35, so any 35k is also divisible by 35, and thus gcd(205800, 35k) is at least 35, regardless of k. Thus the prior inference that gcd could be 1 is wrong; rather, d always contains 5·7 so is at least 35.\\n12) Since 205800 = 2³·3·5²·7³ and 35k = 5·7·k, gcd(205800, 35k) = 5·7·gcd(205800/(5·7), k) but 205800/(35) = 2³·3·5·7², which is coprime to 35 but not necessarily to k. Thus the gcd can be 35 times any divisor of 2³·3·5·7² that also divides k. This means gcd values can be 35 multiplied by various combinations of 2,3,5,7.\\n13) For gcd to be a perfect square, write gcd(205800, 35k) = 2^α 3^β 5^γ 7^δ where α ≤ 3, β ≤ 1, γ ≤ 2, δ ≤ 3 and also γ ≥ 1, δ ≥ 1 (since 35 divides both). For this to be a square, all exponents α, β, γ, δ must be even.\\n14) Let k = 2^a 3^b 5^c 7^d · r where r is coprime to 2,3,5,7. Then gcd(205800, 35k) has exponents: α = min(3, a), β = min(1, b), γ = 1 + min(1, c) because 35 contributes one 5 and 205800 contributes up to 2 more, and δ = 1 + min(2, d) for the 7s.\\n15) However, this detailed dependence is messy; instead, directly compute gcd(205800, 35k) = gcd(205800, 35) · gcd(205800/35, k) when gcd(35, 205800/35) = 1, which holds here. So gcd(205800, 35k) = 35·gcd(5880, k), since 205800/35 = 5880.\\n16) Factor 5880: 5880 = 588·10 = (2²·3·7²)·(2·5) = 2³·3·5·7².\\n17) So gcd(205800, 35k) = 35·gcd(2³·3·5·7², k). Let h = gcd(5880, k). Then h | 5880, and gcd = 35h.\\n18) We need 35h to be a perfect square. Factor 35h: 35 = 5·7, and h divides 2³·3·5·7². Write h = 2^u 3^v 5^w 7^z with 0 ≤ u ≤ 3, 0 ≤ v ≤ 1, 0 ≤ w ≤ 1, 0 ≤ z ≤ 2.\\n19) Then 35h = 2^u 3^v 5^(w+1) 7^(z+1). For this to be a square, all exponents must be even: u even, v even, w+1 even, z+1 even.\\n20) From bounds: u ∈ {0,1,2,3}. Even possibilities: u = 0 or 2. v ∈ {0,1}. Even possibilities: v = 0 only. w ∈ {0,1}. w+1 even ⇒ w = 1. z ∈ {0,1,2}. z+1 even ⇒ z ∈ {1}.\\n21) Thus h must be 2^u 3^0 5^1 7^1 with u ∈ {0,2}. So possible h: 5·7 = 35, or 2²·5·7 = 4·35 = 140.\\n22) Conversely, any k with gcd(5880, k) equal to 35 or 140 will make (205800, 35k) a happy pair.\\n23) Now count positive integers k ≤ N = 2940 such that gcd(5880, k) ∈ {35, 140}.\\n24) Let’s characterize k in each case.\\n   Case A: gcd(5880, k) = 35. Then k is divisible by 35 but not by 140 (to avoid gcd≥140) and shares no additional prime factors 2 or 3 beyond those in 35. Since 5880 = 2³·3·5·7², having gcd 35 means: k has exactly 5¹ 7¹, and no factor 2 or 3, and not 7². So k = 5·7·r where r is coprime to 2,3,5,7 and also not contributing an extra 7. Thus r must be coprime to 2,3,5,7; equivalently gcd(r, 2·3·5·7) = 1.\\n   Case B: gcd(5880, k) = 140. Then k has 2²·5·7 and shares no extra factor 3 or extra factor 2 beyond 2² or 7² beyond 7¹. So k = 2²·5·7·r = 140r where r is coprime to 2,3,5,7 (so that gcd with 5880 gives exactly 140).\\n25) Count Case A with k ≤ 2940. Write k = 35r, gcd(r, 210) = 1, and 35r ≤ 2940 ⇒ r ≤ 2940/35 = 84.\\n26) So we need number of integers 1 ≤ r ≤ 84 with gcd(r, 210) = 1. Since 210 = 2·3·5·7, these are the integers up to 84 not divisible by 2,3,5,7.\\n27) Use inclusion-exclusion. Total 84. For each prime:\\n   Divisible by 2: floor(84/2) = 42\\n   By 3: floor(84/3) = 28\\n   By 5: floor(84/5) = 16\\n   By 7: floor(84/7) = 12\\n   Pairwise intersections:\\n   2·3=6: floor(84/6)=14\\n   2·5=10: floor(84/10)=8\\n   2·7=14: floor(84/14)=6\\n   3·5=15: floor(84/15)=5\\n   3·7=21: floor(84/21)=4\\n   5·7=35: floor(84/35)=2\\n   Triple intersections:\\n   2·3·5=30: floor(84/30)=2\\n   2·3·7=42: floor(84/42)=2\\n   2·5·7=70: floor(84/70)=1\\n   3·5·7=105: floor(84/105)=0\\n   Quadruple intersection:\\n   2·3·5·7=210: floor(84/210)=0.\\n28) Number divisible by at least one of 2,3,5,7 is:\\n   42+28+16+12 − (14+8+6+5+4+2) + (2+2+1+0) − 0\\n   = (98) − (39) + (5)\\n   = 59 + 5\\n   = 64.\\n29) So numbers 1..84 coprime to 210: 84 − 64 = 20. Thus Case A gives 20 values of k.\\n30) Case B: k = 140r, gcd(r, 210) = 1, and 140r ≤ 2940 ⇒ r ≤ 2940/140 = 21.\\n31) Count 1 ≤ r ≤ 21 with gcd(r, 210) = 1. Again, not divisible by 2,3,5,7.\\n   Total 21.\\n   Divisible by 2: floor(21/2)=10\\n   By 3: floor(21/3)=7\\n   By 5: floor(21/5)=4\\n   By 7: floor(21/7)=3\\n   Pairwise:\\n   2·3=6: floor(21/6)=3\\n   2·5=10: floor(21/10)=2\\n   2·7=14: floor(21/14)=1\\n   3·5=15: floor(21/15)=1\\n   3·7=21: floor(21/21)=1\\n   5·7=35: floor(21/35)=0\\n   Triple:\\n   2·3·5=30: 0\\n   2·3·7=42: 0\\n   2·5·7=70: 0\\n   3·5·7=105: 0\\n   Quadruple: 0.\\n32) Number divisible by at least one of 2,3,5,7:\\n   10+7+4+3 − (3+2+1+1+1+0) + 0\\n   = 24 − 8\\n   = 16.\\n33) So there are 21 − 16 = 5 integers r giving gcd(r, 210)=1.\\n34) Hence Case B gives 5 values of k.\\n35) Total number of possible k is 20 + 5 = 25, with k ≤ 2940.\\n36) Therefore, the number of possible values of k is 25.\",\n    \"answer\": \"25\"\n}",
