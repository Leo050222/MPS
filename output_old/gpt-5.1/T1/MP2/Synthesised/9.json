  "math_problem": "Consider the following flowchart: INPUT $\\rightarrow$ Subtract $8 \\rightarrow \\square \\rightarrow$ Divide by $2 \\rightarrow \\square$ Add $16 \\rightarrow$ OUTPUT. If the OUTPUT is 32, what was the INPUT? Instead of determining the initial input value that produces the specified output via the flowchart's sequence of operations, simply find $k = A - 26$, where $A$ is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step. What is the $y$-intercept of the line $y = x + 4$ after it is translated down $k$ units?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Let the input be x. Flowchart steps: 1) Subtract 8: x - 8. 2) First square is unspecified; call its output A. 3) Divide by 2: A / 2. 4) Second square is unspecified; call its output B. 5) Add 16: B + 16 = OUTPUT = 32. Then B + 16 = 32 ⇒ B = 16. We are not asked to determine the input or fully solve for A using the flowchart details; instead, we are told to define k = A - 26. The problem then asks: what is the y-intercept of y = x + 4 after it is translated down k units? The original line y = x + 4 has y-intercept 4. Translating down k units subtracts k from all y-values, making the new y-intercept 4 - k. Since k = A - 26, the new intercept is 4 - (A - 26) = 4 - A + 26 = 30 - A. Therefore, the y-intercept after the translation is 30 - A.\",\n    \"answer\": \"30 - A\"\n}",
