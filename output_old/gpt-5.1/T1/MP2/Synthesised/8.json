  "math_problem": "If \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers with \\( x>y \\) and \\( x+x y=391 \\), what is the value of \\( x+y \\)? Instead of finding the sum of the two positive integers satisfying the given equation and inequality, simply find \\( k = y + 14 \\), where \\( y \\) is the smaller positive integer in the pair that solves the equation under the stated conditions. There are \\( k \\) people in a room, 60% of whom are men. If no men enter or leave the room, how many women must enter the room so that 40% of the total number of people in the room are men?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We have positive integers x and y with x > y and x + x y = 391. Factor: x(1 + y) = 391. Prime factorization: 391 = 17 * 23. The positive factor pairs (x, 1 + y) are (1,391), (17,23), (23,17), (391,1). Check which give integer y and satisfy x > y.\\n1) x = 1, 1 + y = 391 → y = 390, but x > y fails (1 ≯ 390).\\n2) x = 17, 1 + y = 23 → y = 22, and x > y? 17 ≯ 22, fails.\\n3) x = 23, 1 + y = 17 → y = 16, and 23 > 16, works.\\n4) x = 391, 1 + y = 1 → y = 0, but y must be positive, so invalid.\\nThus the valid solution is (x, y) = (23, 16), so the smaller integer is y = 16.\\nWe are told not to find x + y but instead k = y + 14. So k = 16 + 14 = 30.\\nNow there are k people in the room, so total people initially = 30. 60% are men, so number of men = 0.6 * 30 = 18, and women initially = 30 - 18 = 12.\\nLet w be the number of women who must enter. After w women enter, men remain 18, women become 12 + w, total becomes 30 + w. We want men to be 40% of the total: 18 = 0.4(30 + w).\\nSolve: 18 = 0.4(30 + w) → 18 = 12 + 0.4w → 6 = 0.4w → w = 6 / 0.4 = 15.\\nTherefore, 15 women must enter the room.\",\n    \"answer\": \"15\"\n}",
