The problem states that n is positive and variables have opposite signs, so we use (m,n) = (-2,2). Then k = n - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\\n\\nNow consider the polynomial x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48 with three positive roots p < q < r.\\nWe want the minimum possible value of k/p + 2/q + 3/r.\\nWe already have k = 1, so the expression is 1/p + 2/q + 3/r.\\nLet S = p + q + r, T = pq + pr + qr, and U = pqr.\\nBy Viète, for x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48 = 0, we have S = a (positive), T = b (positive), U = 48.\\nWe are free to choose any triple (p,q,r) of positive real numbers with product 48, then a and b adjust accordingly.\\nSo the constraint is p, q, r > 0 and p q r = 48.\\nWe must minimize F = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r under pqr = 48 and p<q<r.\\n\\nWe can first solve the unconstrained positive minimum (ignore ordering) via Lagrange multipliers.\\nLet G(p,q,r) = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r + λ(pqr - 48).\\nPartial derivatives:\\n∂G/∂p = -1/p^2 + λ q r = 0 ⇒ λqr = 1/p^2.\\n∂G/∂q = -2/q^2 + λ p r = 0 ⇒ λpr = 2/q^2.\\n∂G/∂r = -3/r^2 + λ p q = 0 ⇒ λpq = 3/r^2.\\n\\nFrom λqr = 1/p^2 and λpr = 2/q^2, divide second by first:\\n(λpr)/(λqr) = 2/q^2 ÷ 1/p^2 ⇒ p/q = 2p^2/q^2 ⇒ p/q = 2(p^2/q^2).\\nSimplify: multiply both sides by q^2: p q = 2p^2 ⇒ if p>0, q = 2p.\\n\\nNow compare λpr and λpq:\\n(λpr)/(λpq) = 2/q^2 ÷ 3/r^2 ⇒ r/q = 2r^2/(3q^2) ⇒ multiply by q^2: r q = 2 r^2/3 ⇒ if r>0, q = 2r/3.\\nFrom q = 2p and q = 2r/3 we get 2p = 2r/3 ⇒ r = 3p.\\nThus the stationary point satisfies q = 2p, r = 3p.\\nThe product constraint gives p q r = p · 2p · 3p = 6 p^3 = 48 ⇒ p^3 = 8 ⇒ p = 2.\\nThen q = 4, r = 6, so ordering p < q < r holds.\\n\\nCompute F at this triple:\\nF = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r = 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/6.\\nCompute each term: 1/2 = 3/6, 2/4 = 1/2 = 3/6, 3/6 = 3/6.\\nSum: 3/6 + 3/6 + 3/6 = 9/6 = 3/2.\\nThis is the unique critical point in the feasible region (p,q,r>0) and standard convexity/AM-GM arguments on sums of reciprocals under product constraints confirm it gives the global minimum.\\nMoreover the strict inequalities p<q<r already hold.\\n\\nThus the minimum possible value of k/p + 2/q + 3/r is 3/2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3/2\"\n}",
