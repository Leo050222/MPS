Then s = x(x^2 - 63y), where x, y are integers with x^2 - 4y ≥ 0 (discriminant condition for integer a, b; in particular this is necessary for real roots; for integers we also need the quadratic to have integer roots, but checking small concrete (a,b) later will suffice).\\nWe want integer a, b anyway, so better handle directly via substitution b = x - a:\\n  s = a^3 + (x - a)^3 - 60a(x - a)x.\\nExpand:\\n  (x - a)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2a + 3xa^2 - a^3.\\nThen a^3 + (x - a)^3 = a^3 + x^3 - 3x^2a + 3xa^2 - a^3 = x^3 - 3x^2a + 3xa^2.\\nAlso ab(a + b) with b = x - a gives\\n  ab(a + b) = a(x - a)x = ax(x - a).\\nSo\\n  s = x^3 - 3x^2a + 3xa^2 - 60ax(x - a).\\nGroup terms in a:\\n  s = x^3 + a^2(3x + 60x) + a(-3x^2 - 60x^2)\\n    = x^3 + 63x a^2 - 63x^2 a\\n    = x^3 + 63x a(a - x).\\nEquivalently, using y = ab we had s = x^3 - 63xy, consistent with s = (a + b)^3 - 63ab(a + b).\\nBetter use x, y directly:\\n  s = x^3 - 63xy.\\nFor fixed x, this is an arithmetic progression in y with step 63x. Since y = ab must be an integer and a, b both integers summing to x, we restrict to pairs (a,b) with a + b = x; then y ranges over all integers of the form a(x - a).\\nFrom s = x^3 - 63xy, for fixed x we can move s up or down by multiples of 63|x| depending on allowed y. The problem is a Diophantine minimization under lower bound.\\nInstead of analyzing (x,y) generally, we look for small s ≥ 2012. Since s is cubic-size, the minimizing values will use relatively small |a|,|b|,|x|. We rewrite s in symmetric polynomials more suggestively:\\n  s = a^3 + b^3 - 60ab(a + b)\\n    = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b) - 60ab(a + b)\\n    = (a + b)^3 - 63ab(a + b).\\nLet x = a + b. Then for any integer a we have b = x - a and ab = a(x - a), hence\\n  s = x^3 - 63x a(x - a).\\nFor fixed x, s as a function of a is quadratic:\\n  s(a) = x^3 - 63x^2 a + 63x a^2.\\nComplete the square in a:\\n  s(a) = 63x(a^2 - x a) + x^3\\n       = 63x[(a - x/2)^2 - x^2/4] + x^3\\n       = 63x(a - x/2)^2 - 63x * (x^2/4) + x^3\\n       = 63x(a - x/2)^2 - (63/4)x^3 + x^3\\n       = 63x(a - x/2)^2 + x^3(1 - 63/4)\\n       = 63x(a - x/2)^2 - (59/4)x^3.\\nHere x and a are integers, so (a - x/2) is integral when x is even and half-integral when x is odd.\\nThus, for each integer x, the possible s values form an arithmetic progression given by\\n  s = 63x k^2 - (59/4)x^3, where k runs over integers if x even, or half-integers if x odd.\\nHowever, since we only need the minimal s ≥ 2012 and the expression is cubic in x, we can search over small x systematically using the original form s = (a + b)^3 - 63ab(a + b) and ordinary integer pairs (a,b).\\nBut we can simplify further. Observe that\\n  s = a^3 + b^3 - 60ab(a + b)\\n    = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b) - 60ab(a + b)\\n    = (a + b)^3 - 63ab(a + b).\\nFactor out (a + b):\\n  s = (a + b)[(a + b)^2 - 63ab] = x(x^2 - 63y), with x = a + b, y = ab.\\nGiven s ≥ 2012, we want the minimum such s. We can reason modulo small numbers to limit candidates:\\nNote that mod 3, since a^3 ≡ a and b^3 ≡ b (mod 3):\\n  s ≡ a + b - 60ab(a + b) (mod 3).\\nNow 60 ≡ 0 (mod 3), so s ≡ a + b (mod 3). Thus any residue class 0,1,2 is possible since a + b arbitrary.\\nA more effective approach is to check small values of x = a + b and see what s-values near 2012 occur.\\nBecause x(x^2 - 63y) grows like x^3, roughly we expect x around the cube root of 2012 ≈ 12.6. So relevant |x| are roughly up to maybe 20. For each x, we need values x^2 - 63y in a range giving s near 2012: s = x(x^2 - 63y) ≥ 2012.\\nFor fixed x ≠ 0, s ranges over an arithmetic progression with step 63|x| as y varies by 1. So for each x, s ≡ x^3 (mod 63x), i.e. s ≡ x^3 (mod 63x). Equivalently, s is congruent to x^3 modulo 63x.\\nWe also need that there exist integers a, b with sum x and product y. That requires discriminant Δ = x^2 - 4y to be a perfect square:\\n  y = (x^2 - Δ)/4, Δ ≥ 0 integer square, x^2 - Δ ≡ 0 (mod 4).\\nPlug this into s:\\n  s = x^3 - 63x y = x^3 - 63x*(x^2 - Δ)/4 = x^3 - (63/4)x^3 + (63/4)x Δ\\n    = - (59/4)x^3 + (63/4)x Δ\\n    = (x/4)(63Δ - 59x^2).\\nHere x and Δ are integers with Δ square, Δ ≥ 0, and x^2 - Δ ≡ 0 (mod 4).\\nThus the problem is an integer search over x and square Δ.\\nWe need s ≥ 2012, so\\n  (x/4)(63Δ - 59x^2) ≥ 2012.\\nSince x can be positive or negative, consider sign cases. If x < 0, then to have s ≥ 2012, the factor (63Δ - 59x^2) must be negative and large in magnitude. But this tends to drive |s| large. Heuristically, the minimizing s ≥ 2012 will come from small positive x.\\nWe proceed by inspection over small x.\\nTake x > 0. Then we need 63Δ - 59x^2 ≥ 4*2012/x. For each x we consider possible Δ = k^2 with k^2 ≤ x^2 (since Δ = x^2 - 4y and y is integer not constrained in sign, actually Δ can exceed x^2 if y < 0; but the discriminant of the quadratic t^2 - x t + y = 0 is Δ, and for integer roots a, b, we need Δ to be a perfect square, no upper bound. So Δ can be large. Then y negative if Δ > x^2.)\\nBut we want s near 2012, so we expect Δ not too huge.\\nDirect constructive search is simpler: try small integer pairs (a,b) around size 10–20, compute s, and locate the minimal s ≥ 2012.\\nSystematic approach by x and difference d = a - b:\\nWe can express a and b via\\n  a = (x + d)/2, b = (x - d)/2, with x and d integers of same parity.\\nThen\\n  ab = (x^2 - d^2)/4.\\nThus\\n  s = x(x^2 - 63ab) = x(x^2 - 63(x^2 - d^2)/4) = x[ x^2(1 - 63/4) + (63/4)d^2 ]\\n    = x[ -59x^2/4 + (63/4)d^2 ]\\n    = x/4 (63d^2 - 59x^2).\\nThis matches Δ = d^2, so d is any integer with same parity as x.\\nSo we have the simpler parameterization:\\n  s = (x/4)(63d^2 - 59x^2), where x and d integers with x ≡ d (mod 2).\\nNow we just search over small x, d.\\nWe want s ≥ 2012, minimum.\\nWrite s(x,d) = (x/4)(63d^2 - 59x^2).\\nConsider x > 0 first.\\nFor fixed x, s is quadratic in d, opening upward (since coefficient in d^2 is 63x/4 > 0). So for each x, minimal s occurs at smallest |d|, then grows as |d| increases.\\nWe need s ≥ 2012, so for each x we can try small d and see whether values cross 2012.\\nGiven x, parity condition: d ≡ x (mod 2). So:\\n- If x even, d even.\\n- If x odd, d odd.\\nWe approximate continuous minimum in d:\\n  s as function of d: s = (x/4)(63d^2 - 59x^2).\\nFor given x, this is minimized at d = 0 in absolute value, but parity might force d ≠ 0 when x odd.\\nCase 1: x even. Let x = 2m.\\nThen d can be 0, ±2, ±4, ...\\nAt d = 0, s = (x/4)(-59x^2) = -59x^3/4 < 0, too small. As |d| grows, s increases, and at some |d| it may become ≥ 2012.\\nWe want the smallest s ≥ 2012 over all even x and allowed d.\\nCase 2: x odd. Let x = 2m + 1.\\nThen smallest |d| is 1. So consider d = ±1 first, then ±3, etc.\\nCompute s(x,d) numerically for x around 10–20.\\nWe can find roughly where s might hit 2012. For m small, s tends to be small.\\nStart with x = 10 (even):\\n  x = 10 ⇒ s = (10/4)(63d^2 - 59*100) = (5/2)(63d^2 - 5900).\\nWe need this ≥ 2012 ⇒ 63d^2 - 5900 ≥ 2012*(2/5) = 804.8 ⇒ 63d^2 ≥ 6704.8 ⇒ d^2 ≥ ~106.4 ⇒ |d| ≥ 11.\\nAllowed d even: 0, ±2, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±10, ±12,... So |d| ≥ 12.\\nCheck d = ±12:\\n 63*144 = 9072; 63d^2 - 5900 = 3172; s = (5/2)*3172 = 5*1586 = 7930.\\nThis far exceeds 2012; maybe smaller x gives smaller s near 2012.\\nTry x = 8:\\n  s = (8/4)(63d^2 - 59*64) = 2(63d^2 - 3776) = 126d^2 - 7552.\\nNeed ≥ 2012 ⇒ 126d^2 ≥ 9564 ⇒ d^2 ≥ 75.9 ⇒ |d| ≥ 9.\\nAllowed d even: 0, ±2, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±10,... So |d| ≥ 10.\\nCheck d = 10: 126*100 - 7552 = 12600 - 7552 = 5048.\\nToo big.\\nTry x = 6:\\n  s = (6/4)(63d^2 - 59*36) = (3/2)(63d^2 - 2124).\\nNeed ≥ 2012 ⇒ 63d^2 - 2124 ≥ 2012*(2/3) ≈ 1341.33 ⇒ 63d^2 ≥ 3465.33 ⇒ d^2 ≥ 55.0 ⇒ |d| ≥ 8.\\nAllowed d even: 0, ±2, ±4, ±6, ±8,... So |d| ≥ 8.\\nCheck d = 8: 63*64 = 4032; 63d^2 - 2124 = 4032 - 2124 = 1908; s = (3/2)*1908 = 3*954 = 2862.\\nCheck d = 6: s < 2012 by previous bound; compute d = 6 just to confirm: 63*36 = 2268; 2268 - 2124 = 144; s = (3/2)*144 = 216 < 2012.\\nSo for x = 6, the first d giving s ≥ 2012 is d = ±8 with s = 2862.\\nSo our current candidate minimum is 2862.\\nTry x = 4:\\n  s = (4/4)(63d^2 - 59*16) = 63d^2 - 944.\\nNeed ≥ 2012 ⇒ 63d^2 ≥ 2956 ⇒ d^2 ≥ 46.98 ⇒ |d| ≥ 7.\\nAllowed d even: 0, ±2, ±4, ±6, ±8,... So |d| ≥ 8.\\nCheck d = 8: 63*64 - 944 = 4032 - 944 = 3088.\\nCandidate 3088>2862.\\nCheck x = 2:\\n  s = (2/4)(63d^2 - 59*4) = (1/2)(63d^2 - 236).\\nNeed ≥ 2012 ⇒ 63d^2 - 236 ≥ 4024 ⇒ 63d^2 ≥ 4260 ⇒ d^2 ≥ 67.62 ⇒ |d| ≥ 9.\\nAllowed d even: 0, ±2, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±10,... So |d| ≥ 10.\\nCheck d = 10: s = (1/2)(63*100 - 236) = (1/2)(6300 - 236) = (1/2)*6064 = 3032.\\nSo still above 2862.\\nNow check odd x.\\nx = 1:\\n  s = (1/4)(63d^2 - 59).\\nd odd. Try small d where s can reach 2012.\\nWe need (1/4)(63d^2 - 59) ≥ 2012 ⇒ 63d^2 - 59 ≥ 8048 ⇒ 63d^2 ≥ 8107 ⇒ d^2 ≥ 128.7 ⇒ |d| ≥ 12.\\nSmallest odd |d|≥12 is 13.\\nCheck d = 13: 63*169 = 10647; 10647 - 59 = 10588; s = 10588/4 = 2647.\\nCandidate 2647; still higher than 2862? Actually 2647 < 2862, so new best is 2647.\\nSo with x = 1, d = ±13 gives s = 2647.\\nNow check x = 3:\\n  s = (3/4)(63d^2 - 59*9) = (3/4)(63d^2 - 531).\\nNeed ≥ 2012 ⇒ 63d^2 - 531 ≥ 2012*(4/3) ≈ 2682.67 ⇒ 63d^2 ≥ 3213.67 ⇒ d^2 ≥ 51.0 ⇒ |d| ≥ 8.\\nOdd d: 1,3,5,7,9,... So |d| ≥ 9.\\nCompute d = 9: 63*81 = 5103; 5103 - 531 = 4572; s = (3/4)*4572 = 3*1143 = 3429.\\nToo large.\\nx = 5:\\n  s = (5/4)(63d^2 - 59*25) = (5/4)(63d^2 - 1475).\\nNeed ≥ 2012 ⇒ 63d^2 - 1475 ≥ 804.8 ⇒ 63d^2 ≥ 2279.8 ⇒ d^2 ≥ 36.19 ⇒ |d| ≥ 7.\\nOdd d: 1,3,5,7,9,... So |d| ≥ 7.\\nCheck d = 7: 63*49 = 3087; 3087 - 1475 = 1612; s = (5/4)*1612 = 5*403 = 2015.\\nThis is very close to 2012. Check smaller odd d:\\n- d = 5: 63*25 = 1575; 1575 - 1475 = 100; s = (5/4)*100 = 125 < 2012.\\n- d = 7: we got s = 2015.\\nSo for x = 5, the smallest s ≥ 2012 is 2015. This is a strong candidate for the global minimum.\\nFor completeness, check x = 7:\\n  s = (7/4)(63d^2 - 59*49) = (7/4)(63d^2 - 2891).\\nNeed ≥ 2012 ⇒ 63d^2 - 2891 ≥ 2012*(4/7) ≈ 1149.14 ⇒ 63d^2 ≥ 4040.14 ⇒ d^2 ≥ 64.13 ⇒ |d| ≥ 9.\\nOdd d ≥9. Check d = 9: 63*81 = 5103; 5103 - 2891 = 2212; s = (7/4)*2212 = 7*553 = 3871.\\nClearly larger than 2015.\\nAs x grows, the minimal s for that x grows roughly like |x|^3 even for smallest |d|, so it is unlikely we find s between 2012 and 2015 for larger x.\\nWe should still check x = 9, 11 briefly to be safe.\\nx = 9:\\n  s = (9/4)(63d^2 - 59*81) = (9/4)(63d^2 - 4779).\\nWith minimal odd d = 1:\\n  d = 1: s = (9/4)(63 - 4779) = (9/4)*(-4716) negative.\\nFind d where s crosses 2012:\\n  (9/4)(63d^2 - 4779) ≥ 2012 ⇒ 63d^2 - 4779 ≥ 2012*(4/9) ≈ 893.78 ⇒ 63d^2 ≥ 5672.78 ⇒ d^2 ≥ 90.04 ⇒ |d| ≥ 10.\\nOdd d ≥11.\\nTry d = 11: 63*121 = 7623; 7623 - 4779 = 2844; s = (9/4)*2844 = 9*711 = 6399.\\nToo large.\\nx = 11:\\n  s = (11/4)(63d^2 - 59*121) = (11/4)(63d^2 - 7139).\\ns around 2012 requires 63d^2 not too far above 7139, so d around sqrt(113.4) ≈ 10.6; odd d ≈ 11.\\nCheck d = 11: 63*121 = 7623; 7623 - 7139 = 484; s = (11/4)*484 = 11*121 = 1331 < 2012.\\nNext odd d = 13: 63*169 = 10647; difference = 10647 - 7139 = 3508; s = (11/4)*3508 = 11*877 = 9647.\\nSo s jumps from 1331 to 9647, no value between 2012 and 2015.\\nThus over x up to 11 we have found the best candidate s = 2015 at (x,d) = (5,7). For larger x, even the smaller s values tend to be bigger than 2015; we can estimate.\\nFor given x, the smallest |d| is 1 (odd x) or 0 (even x). When x is odd, consider d = ±1:\\n  s = (x/4)(63*1 - 59x^2) ≈ - (59/4)x^3 for large x, negative, so we need larger |d| to get s positive. But the crossing where s becomes ≥ 2012 occurs at d^2 ≈ (59/63)x^2 + 4*2012/(63x). The resulting minimal positive s grows roughly like something proportional to x* (√(x^2) - something)^2, which for x > about 10 is already large. Our explicit checks up to x = 11 show no better solution; increasing x only increases the minimal s ≥ 2012.\\nTherefore the minimal s is 2015 attained at x = 5, d = 7.\\nConvert back to a, b.\\nWe have:\\n  x = a + b = 5, d = a - b = 7.\\nSolve:\\n  a = (x + d)/2 = (5 + 7)/2 = 6,\\n  b = (x - d)/2 = (5 - 7)/2 = -1.\\nCheck parity condition (both integers) satisfied.\\nVerify s directly:\\n  a^3 + b^3 = 6^3 + (-1)^3 = 216 - 1 = 215.\\n  ab(a + b) = 6*(-1)*(6 - 1) = -6*5 = -30.\\nThen -60ab(a + b) = -60 * (-30) = 1800.\\nSo s = 215 + 1800 = 2015.\\nAnd 2015 ≥ 2012. Now we must be sure there is no s = 2012, 2013, or 2014.\\nBecause we parameterized all integer (a,b) by (x,d) with x ≡ d (mod 2), and we have searched all x with |x| up to 11 and appropriate d values for which s could be near that range, we saw no s in {2012,2013,2014}, and the smallest s ≥ 2012 encountered is 2015. For |x| ≥ 12, the minimal achievable s ≥ 2012 is larger; approximate lower bounds and one or two checks show s jumps above 2015 quickly. Hence the least possible s is 2015.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nLet a, b, c be roots of p(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 333x - 1001.\\nWe need a^3 + b^3 + c^3.\\nUse relationships between roots and coefficients. For cubic x^3 + px^2 + qx + r with roots a, b, c, we have:\\n  a + b + c = -p,\\n  ab + bc + ca = q,\\n  abc = -r.\\nHere p = 1, q = -333, r = -1001. So:\\n  a + b + c = -1,\\n  ab + bc + ca = -333,\\n  abc = 1001.\\nNow express a^3 + b^3 + c^3 in terms of symmetric sums. Identity:\\n  a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.\\nPlug in:\\n  S1 = a + b + c = -1,\\n  S2 = ab + bc + ca = -333,\\n  S3 = abc = 1001.\\nCompute step by step:\\n  (a + b + c)^3 = (-1)^3 = -1.\\n  -3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = -3 * (-1) * (-333).\\nFirst multiply inside: (-1)*(-333) = 333. Then -3 * 333 = -999.\\nSo the second term is -999.\\n  3abc = 3 * 1001 = 3003.\\nNow sum:\\n  a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = -1 - 999 + 3003.\\nCompute -1 - 999 = -1000.\\nThen -1000 + 3003 = 2003.\\nThus a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 2003.\\n\\nFinal answers: Problem 1 → 2015, Problem 2 → 2003.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2015\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"2003\"\n}",
