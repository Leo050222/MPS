The remaining empty space in MB is 307200 − 300000 = 7200 MB. To express this in GB, divide by 1024: 7200 ÷ 1024 = 7.03125 GB. So the remaining empty space is 7.03125 GB.\\n\\nProblem 2: Regular bicycle price = 320, on sale for 20% off. Discount on bicycle = 0.20 × 320 = 64, so sale price of bicycle = 320 − 64 = 256. Regular helmet price = 80, on sale for 10% off. Discount on helmet = 0.10 × 80 = 8, so sale price of helmet = 80 − 8 = 72. Total regular price for both items = 320 + 80 = 400. Total sale price = 256 + 72 = 328. Total savings = 400 − 328 = 72. Percentage savings on total purchase = (savings ÷ regular total) × 100% = (72 ÷ 400) × 100% = 18%.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"7.03125\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"18\"\n}",
