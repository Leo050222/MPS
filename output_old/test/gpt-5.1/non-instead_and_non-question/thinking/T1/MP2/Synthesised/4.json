  "math_problem": "Storage space on a computer is measured in gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB), where $1 \\mathrm{~GB} = 1024 \\mathrm{MB}$. Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. Let $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes. The regular price for a bicycle is $\\\\$320$. The bicycle is on sale for $20\\\\%$ off. The regular price for a helmet is $\\\\$80$. The helmet is on sale for $10\\\\%$ off. If Sandra bought both items on sale, her percentage savings on the total purchase is $\\left( \\frac{\\text{total savings}}{\\text{total price}} \\right) \\times d\\\\%$. Compute this value.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First compute the hard drive capacity in megabytes. Since 1 GB = 1024 MB, a 300 GB drive has C = 300 × 1024 = 307200 MB. Then d = C − 307100 = 307200 − 307100 = 100.\\nNext, compute the sale prices and savings:\\n- Bicycle: regular $320, 20% off → savings = 0.20 × 320 = 64, sale price = 320 − 64 = 256.\\n- Helmet: regular $80, 10% off → savings = 0.10 × 80 = 8, sale price = 80 − 8 = 72.\\nTotal regular price = 320 + 80 = 400.\\nTotal sale price = 256 + 72 = 328.\\nTotal savings = 400 − 328 = 72.\\nThe usual percentage savings on the total purchase is (total savings / total price). Here “total price” refers to the regular total price 400, so the fraction is 72/400 = 9/50.\\nWe are told the percentage savings is (total savings / total price) × d %, so this becomes (9/50) × d %. With d = 100, this equals (9/50) × 100 = 9 × 2 = 18.\\nThus the computed value is 18.\",\n    \"answer\": \"18\"\n}",
