  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Let $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game. What is the probability that exactly $k$ games will need to be played to determine a winner?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We have a set A with n ≥ 1 elements. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair, and the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of A. If the configuration has only one pair and that pair partitions A, then that pair must contain all elements of A. A pair, however, has exactly 2 elements. Therefore the only possibility is n = 2, so there is exactly 1 consistent 2-configuration: the single pair containing the two elements of A. Thus A admits such a configuration precisely when n = 2. We are told k = n + 5, so k = 2 + 5 = 7. Next, we consider a best-of-9 series: the first team to 5 wins takes the series. The Mathletes have probability p = 2/3 to win any given game, independently. We want the probability that exactly k = 7 games are needed to determine a winner. This means the series ends on game 7, so after 6 games neither team has reached 5 wins (no one can yet, since 5 wins ends the series) and at game 7 one reaches 5. Concretely, in a best-of-9, a team wins the series when it reaches 5 wins, so the maximum number of games is 9. For the series to end in exactly 7 games, the winner must have 5 wins and the loser 2 wins (since 5+2 = 7). Thus the final series record is 5–2. There are two cases: (1) Mathletes win 5–2; (2) Opponents win 5–2. Case 1: Mathletes win in 7. For the series to end on game 7, after 6 games the Mathletes must have 4 wins and the opponents 2 wins (so that neither side has already reached 5). Then the Mathletes win game 7. The number of sequences of the first 6 games with exactly 4 Mathlete wins and 2 losses is C(6,4). The probability of any specific such sequence is p^4(1−p)^2, and the probability of a Mathlete win in game 7 is p. So P(Mathletes win in 7) = C(6,4) · p^4 (1−p)^2 · p = C(6,4) · p^5 (1−p)^2. Case 2: Mathletes lose in 7. After 6 games the Mathletes must have 2 wins and 4 losses (so the opponents have 4 wins); then the Mathletes lose game 7. The number of such sequences is C(6,2), each with probability p^2 (1−p)^4, and game 7 has probability (1−p) of a Mathlete loss. Thus P(Mathletes lose in 7) = C(6,2) · p^2 (1−p)^4 · (1−p) = C(6,2) · p^2 (1−p)^5. Therefore, the total probability that exactly 7 games are played is: P = C(6,4) p^5 (1−p)^2 + C(6,2) p^2 (1−p)^5. Plug in p = 2/3 and 1−p = 1/3. Compute the binomial coefficients: C(6,4) = 15 and C(6,2) = 15. So P = 15·(2/3)^5·(1/3)^2 + 15·(2/3)^2·(1/3)^5. Evaluate powers: (2/3)^5 = 32/243, (1/3)^2 = 1/9, so first term is 15·(32/243)·(1/9) = 15·(32/2187) = 480/2187. For the second term, (2/3)^2 = 4/9 and (1/3)^5 = 1/243, giving 15·(4/9)·(1/243) = 15·(4/2187) = 60/2187. Sum them: 480/2187 + 60/2187 = 540/2187. Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 27: 540 ÷ 27 = 20, 2187 ÷ 27 = 81, so P = 20/81. That is the exact probability that exactly k = 7 games are needed to determine a winner.\",\n    \"answer\": \"20/81\"\n}",
