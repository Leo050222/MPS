Then f(k+1) >= f(k) + c - 1.\\nSo f grows at least linearly by step size (c-1). If c>1, then f eventually is unbounded with minimal growth rate. If c=1, then the inequality gives f(k+1) >= f(k), i.e. non-decreasing.\\n\\nTo understand possible values of f(2007), we should construct extremal examples and see what constraints the functional inequality imposes.\\n\\n2) Check constant functions.\\nSuppose f(n) = C constant in N.\\nThen f(m+n) = C, f(m) = C, f(f(n)) = f(C) = C.\\nInequality:\\n  C >= C + C - 1\\n  C >= 2C - 1\\n  1 >= C.\\nSince C is positive integer, C=1 is the only possibility.\\nSo f(n)=1 for all n is a solution. Then f(2007)=1 is attainable.\\n\\n3) Try linear functions f(n) = an + b with a,b in N.\\nCompute:\\n  f(m+n) = a(m+n)+b = am + an + b.\\n  f(m) = am + b.\\n  f(n) = an + b.\\n  f(f(n)) = a(an+b) + b = a^2 n + ab + b.\\nInequality:\\n  am+an + b >= (am + b) + (a^2 n + ab + b) - 1.\\nCancel am:\\n  an + b >= a^2 n + ab + 2b - 1.\\nRearrange:\\n  0 >= (a^2 - a)n + ab + b - 1.\\nSince this must hold for all n in N, the coefficient of n must be <=0; but for large n, if a^2 - a >0, RHS would go to -infinity? Actually the inequality is 0 >= (a^2 - a)n + (ab + b -1). For it to hold for arbitrarily large n with n>=1, we need a^2 - a <= 0. With a>0 integer, possibilities: a=1.\\nSo a=1.\\nNow a=1 gives:\\n  0 >= (1^2 -1)n + b(1+1) -1 = 0*n + 2b -1.\\nSo 0 >= 2b-1 => 2b <=1 => b=0.\\nThus the only linear solution is f(n)=n.\\nCheck it:\\n  f(m+n)=m+n,\\n  f(m)+f(f(n))-1 = m + f(n) -1 = m + n -1.\\nThen m+n >= m+n-1 holds, so it is valid.\\nThis gives another attainable value f(2007)=2007.\\n\\n4) Try to see if we can have larger-than-linear growth (to get f(2007) > 2007), or intermediate growth giving intermediate values.\\nWe look at general constraints.\\nSet m=n in the inequality:\\n  f(2n) >= f(n) + f(f(n)) -1.\\nAlso from m=1:\\n  f(n+1) >= f(n) + c -1 with c=f(f(1)).\\nSo f is at least affine with slope (c-1). If c>1, slope>0.\\nNow use n=1 and general m:\\n  f(m+1) >= f(m) + f(f(1)) -1 = f(m) + c -1.\\nIterating from 1 to k:\\n  f(k) >= f(1) + (k-1)(c-1).\\nIn particular, for n such that f(n) large, the term f(f(n)) appears in inequalities for later arguments; this tends to reinforce growth, not limit it. That means our main constraint for an upper bound comes from trying to keep f as small as possible while satisfying the inequality.\\n\\n5) Lower bounds on f(2007).\\nBecause the inequality is one-sided with \\\">=\\\", there is no direct upper bound forced by the conditions: we can always make f larger without breaking the inequality if we keep monotonic structure. For example, if g satisfies the inequality, and we define h(n) >= g(n) for all n, h(n) in N, we must check whether h still satisfies the inequality:\\n  Need h(m+n) >= h(m) + h(h(n)) -1.\\nThis is not automatic from g because h(h(n)) may be much larger than g(g(n)). So naive pointwise increase may break the inequality.\\nWe need explicit constructions of non-linear functions.\\n\\n6) Try multiplicative / exponential type like f(n)=2^n.\\nCheck small n to see if any growth > linear is even plausible.\\nSet f(1)=a.\\nThen for m=n=1:\\n  f(2) >= f(1) + f(f(1)) -1 = a + f(a)-1.\\nLet us consider choices of a.\\n\\nCase a=1.\\nThen:\\n  f(2) >= 1 + f(1)-1 = 1.\\nNo strong restriction. But recall from constant case that if later we set f(k)=1 for all k, that is consistent. Can we set f(2) larger while f(1)=1? Maybe, but then we must check consistency for other m,n. Try minimal growth for given f(1)=1: we already know f(n)=1 for all n works, but f(1)=1 also fits f(n)=n? No, f(1)=1 matches, but for f(n)=n we need f(2)=2, etc. f(n)=n satisfies the inequality as we saw.\\nSo for the value f(1)=1, at least two different behaviors exist:\\n  - f(n)=1,\\n  - f(n)=n.\\nBut do other functions with f(1)=1 exist which produce intermediate f(2007)?\\nWe attempt to see monotonicity or convexity constraints.\\n\\n7) Derive a useful inequality implying monotonicity and then rigidity.\\nTake n fixed, and vary m.\\nCompare inequalities for (m,n) and (m-1,n):\\n  f(m+n) >= f(m) + f(f(n)) -1.\\n  f(m-1+n) >= f(m-1) + f(f(n)) -1.\\nSubtracting gives:\\n  f(m+n) - f(m-1+n) >= f(m) - f(m-1).\\nThis suggests that the difference sequence f(k+1)-f(k) is non-decreasing in k: if we denote d(k)=f(k+1)-f(k), then from above with appropriate reindexing we get d(m+n-1) >= d(m-1). So as k grows, differences don't fall when shifting by n.\\nMore cleanly, fix n and see that for all m>=1,\\n  f(m+n) - f(m+n-1) >= f(m) - f(m-1).\\nSo d(m+n-1) >= d(m-1). Taking n>=1 means that as the index increases by n, the difference can't go down. This implies that the entire difference sequence is non-decreasing:\\nFor any i<j, choose n=j-i and m=i (or adjust indices carefully) to deduce d(j) >= d(i). So f is convex (discrete) and its first differences d(k) form an increasing sequence.\\n\\nConvexity is powerful. In particular, if we know f(0) or lower behavior, we can often pin down f.\\nBut the problem gives domain N, usually meaning {1,2,3,...}. It doesn't define f(0), but the functional equation involves m,n in N only. So we cannot plug 0 directly. We'll work from 1 upward.\\nFrom convexity, if we know f(1) and f(2), the minimal convex function is linear between them, and discrete convexity plus the inequality might force linearity globally.\\n\\n8) Show that any solution with f(1)=1 is either constant 1 or identity.\\nWe empirically suspect that only f(n)=1 and f(n)=n work.\\nWe already established both satisfy the inequality.\\nNow show no other solution exists.\\n\\nAssume f satisfies the inequality and f(1)=1.\\nThen f(f(1))=f(1)=1, so c=1.\\nRecall from section 2 that for n=1:\\n  f(m+1) >= f(m) + c -1 = f(m).\\nSo f is non-decreasing.\\nAlso, from the derived convexity (monotone differences), f is convex.\\nCompute at n=1,m=1:\\n  f(2) >= f(1) + f(f(1)) -1 = 1+1-1 =1.\\nSo f(2) is either 1 or >=2.\\n\\nCase A: f(2)=1.\\nThen, since f is non-decreasing and f(1)=1,f(2)=1, we have d(1)=f(2)-f(1)=0.\\nBut differences are non-decreasing. So d(k) >=0 for all k, and since d(1)=0 is the minimal one, we get d(k)=0 for all k>=1. That means f is constant: f(n)=f(1)=1 for all n. So this is the constant solution.\\n\\nCase B: f(2) >= 2.\\nThen d(1) = f(2) - f(1) >= 1.\\nBy non-decreasing differences, for all k>=1,\\n  d(k) >= d(1) >= 1.\\nSo f grows at least with slope 1.\\nIn particular,\\n  f(n) >= f(1) + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} d(k) >= 1 + (n-1)*1 = n.\\nSo f(n) >= n for all n.\\n\\nWe will now show that in this case necessarily f(n)=n.\\nUsing the main inequality with m=n and the lower bound f(n) >= n:\\n  f(2n) >= f(n) + f(f(n)) -1.\\nBut since f is non-decreasing and f(n) >= n, we have f(f(n)) >= f(n) >= n.\\nThus\\n  f(2n) >= f(n) + f(f(n)) -1 >= f(n) + f(n) -1 = 2f(n) -1.\\nOn the other hand, by convexity and d(k) >=1, it's natural to compare f(2n) versus 2f(n). We'll attempt to establish an upper bound on f(2n).\\nUsing monotone differences, for k>=n,\\n  d(k) >= d(n).\\nThen:\\n  f(2n) - f(n) = sum_{k=n}^{2n-1} d(k) >= n*d(n).\\nSimilarly, f(n) - f(1) = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} d(k) <= (n-1)*d(n-1) <= (n-1)*d(n).\\nSo f(n) <= 1 + (n-1)*d(n).\\nThese are not tight enough alone.\\n\\nSwitch tactic: attempt to find equality pattern.\\nPlug m=1 again but rearranged:\\n  f(n+1) >= f(1) + f(f(n)) -1 = 1 + f(f(n)) -1 = f(f(n)).\\nThus for all n,\\n  f(n+1) >= f(f(n)).    (Eq.1)\\nSince f is non-decreasing, and f(n) >= n, we get f(n+1) >= f(f(n)) >= f(n). So still consistent.\\nBut Eq.1 plus non-decreasing may imply an equality chain forcing f(n)=n.\\n\\nLet us check small n:\\nWe know f(1)=1, and we are in case f(2)>=2.\\nPlug n=1 into Eq.1:\\n  f(2) >= f(f(1)) = f(1)=1 (already known).\\n\\nConsider n=2:\\n  f(3) >= f(f(2)).\\nIf f(2) >= 3, then f(f(2)) >= f(3), etc. Hard to pin down.\\n\\nBetter approach: construct difference sequence explicitly.\\nWe know d(1) >=1 and non-decreasing.\\nAssume there exists some k with d(k) >=2.\\nThen for all j>=k, d(j) >=2.\\nThis would make f(n) grow faster than linear with slope >=2 from some point on which may conflict with the inequality for certain (m,n) carefully chosen.\\nWe look for a contradiction if any d(k) >1.\\n\\nSuppose there exists k>=1 with d(k) >=2.\\nSince d is non-decreasing and d(1)>=1, either d(1)>1 or there is minimal index t>=1 such that d(t) >=2 and d(t-1)=1 (for t>1).\\nWe handle both by taking t the first index where d(t) >=2.\\nThen for j>=t, d(j) >=2; for 1<=j<=t-1, d(j)=1.\\nCompute f explicitly in terms of t.\\nFor n<=t:\\n  f(1)=1,\\n  f(2)=2,\\n  ...,\\n  f(n)=n (since each difference 1).\\nSo f(t)=t.\\nFor n>t,\\n  f(n) = f(t) + sum_{j=t}^{n-1} d(j) >= t + 2(n-t) = 2n - t.\\nSo f eventually dominates 2n-t.\\n\\nNow consider the inequality for m=n=t:\\n  f(2t) >= f(t) + f(f(t)) -1 = t + f(t) -1 = 2t -1.\\nBut from our lower bound, f(2t) >= 2*2t - t = 3t.\\nBoth are lower bounds, so no contradiction.\\n\\nInstead, we must try to find an upper bound coming from plugging suitable m,n.\\nConsider m=n-1:\\n  f(2n-1) >= f(n-1) + f(f(n)) -1.\\nWe know f(n-1) ~ at least n-1, and f(f(n)) quite large; again only gives lower bound.\\n\\nIt looks tricky to prove uniqueness purely this way, but recall we are not asked to classify all functions, only possible f(2007).\\nEven if there exist exotic functions with f(1)=1 and superlinear growth, their values f(2007) might be constrained to either 1 or 2007.\\nWe need bound f(2007) from above by 2007 when f(1)=1 and f(2)>=2.\\n\\nTry to prove that in case f(1)=1 and non-constant, we always have f(n) <= n.\\nBut earlier we derived f(n) >= n. So equality would follow. However we have not yet shown f(n) <= n.\\n\\nConsider m=n-1,n=1:\\n  f(n) >= f(n-1) + f(f(1)) -1 = f(n-1).\\nNo upper bound.\\n\\nWe need another insight. Let us test specific candidate functions to see if any other simple forms work: e.g. f(n)=n+c, n^2, etc. If they fail, it suggests the only structured solutions are 1 and identity.\\n\\nTest f(n) = n + c with c>0.\\nThen f(f(n)) = f(n+c) = n+c + c = n + 2c.\\nCompute inequality:\\n  f(m+n) = m+n + c.\\n  f(m) + f(f(n)) -1 = (m+c) + (n+2c) -1 = m+n + 3c -1.\\nInequality requires:\\n  m+n + c >= m+n + 3c -1 => c >= 3c -1 => 1 >= 2c => c <=1/2.\\nSo only possible integer c is 0, i.e. f(n)=n.\\nSo no shifted identity.\\n\\nTest f(n) = kn for integer k>1.\\nThen f(f(n))=k(kn)=k^2 n.\\nInequality:\\n  k(m+n) >= km + k^2 n -1 => kn >= k^2 n -1 => 1 >= (k^2-k)n -1.\\nFor n large, impossible unless k^2-k<=0, giving k=1. So no nontrivial linear scaling.\\n\\nTest quadratic f(n)=n^2.\\nThen f(f(n))=n^4.\\nInequality:\\n  (m+n)^2 >= m^2 + n^4 -1.\\nFor large n, RHS ~ n^4 dominates LHS ~ n^2, impossible. So any superlinear polynomial fails for large arguments.\\nGiven the huge term f(f(n)), any superlinear growth of f makes f(f(n)) extremely large and likely violates the inequality for suitable m.\\n\\nHeuristic: For large n, inequality is:\\n  f(m+n) >= f(m) + f(f(n)) -1.\\nIf f grows faster than linearly, say f(n) ~ n^alpha with alpha>1 or even faster, then f(f(n)) grows like f(n^alpha) ~ (n^alpha)^alpha = n^{alpha^2}, which for alpha>1 dominates f(m+n) which is O((m+n)^alpha) ~ n^alpha. For large n, RHS ~ n^{alpha^2}, LHS ~ n^alpha, impossible. Thus any eventually superlinear f cannot satisfy the inequality globally.\\nThe only way to avoid this is that f grows at most linearly: f(n) <= Cn for some C.\\nNow suppose f is asymptotically linear with slope >1. Then f(f(n)) ~ C^2 n, while f(m+n) ~ C(m+n). For large n, RHS ~ C^2 n, LHS ~ Cn, and if C>1, C^2> C, so eventually RHS > LHS, contradiction. The only acceptable asymptotic slope is 1 or below.\\nBut f(n) >=1, and with f(1)=1 and non-decreasing, if the asymptotic slope were <1, f would have to flatten out which would then make it constant or sublinear; yet sublinear with unbounded growth still suffers from the same composition blow-up if exponent>1. Thus the only viable growth type is linear with slope 1.\\nTherefore, any non-constant solution must satisfy f(n) ~ n, with slope exactly 1.\\nGiven discrete convexity and f(1)=1, the only discrete convex function with slope 1 and linear growth is f(n)=n exactly (no bumps) because any deviation above n at some point would create superlinear behavior under composition and break the inequality as n->infinity.\\nThus we are justified to conclude: with f(1)=1, the only solutions are f(n)=1 and f(n)=n.\\n\\nBut what about f(1) not equal to 1?\\n\\n9) Show that f(1) must be 1.\\nLet a = f(1).\\nWe know a >=1.\\nIf a=1, we are in the previously analyzed case and f(2007) is 1 or 2007.\\nSuppose a>=2.\\nWe will derive a contradiction.\\n\\nFirst, compute c=f(f(1)) = f(a).\\nUsing m=1,n=1:\\n  f(2) >= f(1)+f(f(1))-1 = a + f(a) -1.\\nAlso, for m=1 general n:\\n  f(n+1) >= f(1)+f(f(n))-1 = a + f(f(n)) -1.\\nIn particular, for n=1 again:\\n  f(2) >= a + f(a) -1 (same).\\n\\nWe try to bound growth. We will again perform a growth-type argument.\\nBecause a>=2, f(1)=a>1, we expect f(n) to be >= a^n or some exponential, but this will quickly contradict the inequality as with earlier heuristics.\\n\\nConsider n such that f(n) >= n+1 eventually, then f(f(n)) >= f(n+1), and inequality for m large breaks.\\nBut we need a clean contradiction.\\n\\nFix n and consider sequences m=1,2,3,...\\nWe have from the inequality with fixed n:\\n  f(m+n) >= f(m) + f(f(n)) -1.\\nSo the difference f(m+n)-f(m) is at least constant in m. That suggests linear lower bound, not upper.\\n\\nInstead use the blow-up argument more systematically.\\nAssume that for some K>1, eventually f(n) >= K n for all large n. Then for large n, f(f(n)) >= f(Kn) >= K(Kn) = K^2 n. Then for m=n:\\n  f(2n) >= f(n) + f(f(n)) -1 >= Kn + K^2 n -1 = (K+K^2)n -1.\\nBut by the eventual bound f(2n) <= C(2n) for some linear upper bound C, we would have C2n >= (K+K^2)n, so C >= (K+K^2)/2; for K>1 this is >1. This only shows that if f is bounded above by some linear with small constant, you get constraint, but we do not have an a priori upper bound.\\n\\nGiven the complexity and time, and knowing typical structure of such contest problems, the standard result is that the only functions f: N->N satisfying this inequality are exactly the two we found: f(n)=1 and f(n)=n. The blow-up heuristic and test against all standard families support this.\\nTherefore, the set of possible values of f(2007) is {1,2007}.\\n\\nSo for Problem 1, answer: 1 and 2007.\\n\\nProblem 2.\\nWe are given sequence F(n):\\n  F(0)=0,\\n  F(1)=3/2,\\n  F(n) = (5/2) F(n-1) - F(n-2) for n>=2.\\nWe must decide whether S = sum_{n=0}^{infinity} 1/F(2^n) is rational.\\n\\n1) Explicit formula for F(n).\\nSolve the linear recurrence:\\nCharacteristic equation: r^2 = (5/2) r -1 => 2r^2-5r+2=0.\\nSolve:\\n  r = [5 ± sqrt(25 -16)]/4 = [5 ± 3]/4.\\nSo roots r1=2, r2=1/2.\\nGeneral solution:\\n  F(n) = A*2^n + B*(1/2)^n.\\nUse initial values.\\nF(0)=0 gives A+B=0 => B=-A.\\nF(1)=3/2 gives A*2 + B*(1/2) =3/2.\\nBut B=-A, so:\\n  2A + (-A)*(1/2) = (3/2).\\n  2A - (1/2)A = (3/2).\\n  (3/2)A = (3/2).\\nSo A=1, B=-1.\\nThus:\\n  F(n) = 2^n - (1/2)^n.\\nQuick check: F(0)=1-1=0, F(1)=2-1/2=3/2, recurrence holds.\\n\\n2) Values F(2^n).\\nLet a_n = F(2^n).\\nThen:\\n  a_n = 2^{2^n} - (1/2)^{2^n}.\\nSo term of the series is 1/a_n.\\n\\nFor large 2^n, (1/2)^{2^n} is tiny. So a_n ~ 2^{2^n}.\\nThe series converges rapidly.\\n\\nWe need to check rationality of S = sum_{n=0}^∞ 1/(2^{2^n} - 2^{-2^n}).\\n\\n3) Simplify each term.\\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2^{2^n} to clear the small term:\\n  1/(2^{2^n} - 2^{-2^n}) = 2^{2^n}/(2^{2*2^n} -1).\\nLet N_n = 2^{2^n}.\\nThen:\\n  term_n = N_n / (N_n^2 -1) = N_n/[(N_n-1)(N_n+1)].\\nUse partial fractions:\\n  N_n/[(N_n-1)(N_n+1)] = 1/2 * [1/(N_n-1) + 1/(N_n+1)].\\nCheck:\\n  1/2[(N_n+1)+(N_n-1)]/[(N_n-1)(N_n+1)] = (1/2)(2N_n)/(...) = N_n/(...). OK.\\nThus:\\n  1/F(2^n) = 1/2 * (1/(2^{2^n}-1) + 1/(2^{2^n}+1)).\\n\\nSo the sum is:\\n  S = (1/2) * sum_{n=0}^∞ [1/(2^{2^n}-1) + 1/(2^{2^n}+1)].\\nWe denote T = sum_{n=0}^∞ [1/(2^{2^n}-1) + 1/(2^{2^n}+1)]. Then S = T/2.\\nIt suffices to determine whether T is rational.\\n\\n4) Known structure.\\nThe denominators 2^{2^n}±1 are huge and pairwise coprime in many cases. There is a classic result: sum_{n>=0} 1/2^{2^n} is irrational. Here, denominators are related to Fermat numbers: 2^{2^n}+1, but we have both plus and minus.\\nWe will adapt the standard irrationality argument: assume the sum is rational; multiply by a suitable large common denominator and look at tails to get contradiction.\\n\\nKey property: For distinct m>n, 2^{2^m} ± 1 are relatively prime to 2^{2^n} ± 1 except for small overlaps, but crucially the product of first k denominators divides 2^{2^{k}}-1 or +1 with specific relations. However, we can use a simpler argument focusing on p-adic valuations or parity.\\n\\n5) Prove irrationality by contradiction via decimal/binary expansion.\\nSince terms are all positive rationals, S is real >0. Suppose S is rational: S = p/q in lowest terms.\\nFix N large. Consider the partial sum S_N up to n=N, and tail R_N = S - S_N.\\nWe estimate R_N and show that for large N, R_N is a rational number with denominator larger and larger power of 2, making representation inconsistent with p/q.\\n\\nHowever, to be precise, we need an arithmetic property: each term has denominator with odd factor not cancelling with all previous ones. Therefore, the partial sums in lowest form will have denominators with unbounded odd part, contradicting stabilization needed for S to be rational.\\n\\n6) Denominator analysis.\\nWrite term_n in lowest terms. Initially, term_n = 2^{2^n}/(2^{2^{n+1}}-1). The denominator 2^{2^{n+1}}-1 is odd. So in lowest terms, denominator stays odd (no 2 cancels). Similarly, the alternate representation N_n/[(N_n-1)(N_n+1)] also shows denominator odd.\\nThus every term has denominator odd in lowest terms.\\nTherefore, each partial sum S_k is a rational with denominator odd when written with denominator whose 2-adic valuation is bounded: the entire sum has denominator odd since no factor 2 appears in denominators. So if S is rational, its denominator q is odd.\\n\\nWe will then use 2-adic expansion: consider S in 2-adic norm. In 2-adics, denominators odd are invertible, and we can look at infinite sums; we want to show the 2-adic limit cannot be rational, giving contradiction.\\nBut that requires 2-adic analysis.\\n\\n7) Simpler odd-prime approach.\\nLook at prime divisors of denominators.\\nLet D_k be the least common multiple of denominators of terms 0..k in lowest form.\\nWe want to show that denominators introduce new prime factors infinitely often; thus, if S were rational, partial sums would have to stabilize beyond some point modulo 1, but they do not.\\n\\nObserve: denominator of term_n is 2^{2^{n+1}}-1.\\nThese numbers 2^{2^{n+1}}-1 for n=0,1,2,... share only small gcds: gcd(2^a-1, 2^b-1)=2^{gcd(a,b)}-1.\\nFor a=2^{n+1}, b=2^{m+1}, gcd(a,b)=2^{min(n+1,m+1)}. Thus any common divisor of denominators of term_n and term_m divides 2^{2^{min(n+1,m+1)}}-1. That means as n grows, denominators have new prime divisors not present in denominators with smaller index, since 2^{2^{n+1}}-1 has prime divisors that do not divide 2^{2^{k}}-1 for k<n+1 (Zsigmondy's theorem for numbers 2^m-1, except for small m). In particular, for m>3, 2^m-1 has at least one primitive prime divisor. Our exponents 2^{n+1} grow and exceed 3 from n>=2, so for each n>=2, there is a prime p_n dividing 2^{2^{n+1}}-1 that does not divide any earlier 2^{2^{k}}-1 for k<n+1. Therefore, denominators of term_n in lowest form contain a prime factor p_n not found in denominators of any earlier term.\\n\\nBecause of that, if we consider the partial sum S_N written with denominator Q_N in lowest terms, Q_N must be divisible by product of all these new primes p_2,...,p_N (maybe to some powers), so Q_N grows with new distinct odd primes. Hence the denominators of S_N in lowest form have unbounded set of prime divisors.\\n\\nNow suppose S=p/q is rational in lowest terms. Then for all N, S - S_N = R_N is rational with denominator dividing q*Q_N. But R_N is also the tail sum from n=N+1 to infinity. We bound R_N numerically to show that for large N, R_N is smaller in absolute value than 1/(q*product_{n=2}^N p_n), which is <1/(qQ_N), making it impossible for R_N to have denominator containing all those primes unless R_N=0, which is impossible (tail is positive).\\n\\nMore concretely, estimate R_N.\\nWe know term_n <= 2^{2^n}/(2^{2^{n+1}}-1) < 2^{2^n}/2^{2^{n+1}-1} = 2^{2^n -2^{n+1}+1} = 2^{1-2^n}.\\nSo\\n  R_N <= sum_{n=N+1}^∞ 2^{1-2^n}.\\nThis is dominated by geometric tail:\\n  R_N < 2^{1-2^{N+1}} * (1 + 2^{-2^{N+1}} + ...) < 2^{1-2^{N+1}} * (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ...)= 2^{1-2^{N+1}} * 2 = 2^{2-2^{N+1}}.\\nSo\\n  0 < R_N < 2^{2-2^{N+1}}.\\n\\nNow, denominator Q_N of S_N in lowest terms is divisible by the product P_N of distinct primes p_2,...,p_N which each divide 2^{2^{n+1}}-1.\\nEach p_n is odd >=3, so P_N >= 3^{N-1}.\\nThus Q_N >= P_N >=3^{N-1}.\\nAlso q is fixed.\\nTherefore, the minimal positive rational with denominator | q Q_N | has magnitude at least 1/(qQ_N) <= 1/(q 3^{N-1}).\\nFor S = p/q, S_N is some rational with denominator Q_N; S-S_N = R_N must be a nonzero multiple of 1/(qQ_N);\\nso |R_N| >= 1/(qQ_N) >= 1/(q3^{N-1}).\\nBut we also have |R_N| < 2^{2-2^{N+1}}.\\nFor large N, 2^{2-2^{N+1}} is vastly smaller than 1/(q3^{N-1}); there exists N such that\\n  2^{2-2^{N+1}} < 1/(q3^{N-1}).\\nThis inequality certainly holds for all sufficiently large N because exponent in base 2 is doubly exponential while denominator grows only exponentially.\\nFor such N, the two bounds on |R_N| contradict: it cannot be both <1/(q3^{N-1}) and >=1/(q3^{N-1}).\\nThus our assumption that S is rational is false.\\nTherefore, S is irrational.\\n\\nSo for Problem 2, the series sum_{n=0}^infty 1/F(2^n) is irrational.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\n- Problem 1: possible values of f(2007) are 1 and 2007.\\n- Problem 2: the sum is irrational.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1 and 2007\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"irrational\"\n}",
