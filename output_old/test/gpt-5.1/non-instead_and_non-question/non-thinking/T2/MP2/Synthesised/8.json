  "math_problem": "During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days. Let $k = |z| - 1$, where $|z|$ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days. Bob's Rice ID number has six digits, each a number from 1 to 9, and any digit can be used any number of times. The ID number satisfies the following property: the first two digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 2, the first three digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 3, the first four digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 4, the first five digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 5, and the ID number itself is congruent to $k$ modulo 6. One ID number that satisfies this condition is 123252. How many different possibilities are there for Bob's ID number?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Let z be a complex number with |z| = r. On Saturday, Eli travels along the points z, z^3, z^5, …, z^2013, in that order, including the starting point z. On Sunday, he travels along 1, z^2, z^4, …, z^2012. Distances between successive points are |z^{odd+2} - z^{odd}| = |z^{odd}| |z^2 - 1| = r^{odd} |z^2 - 1|. Saturday path length L_S is the sum of distances from starting point z to z^3, z^3 to z^5, …, and finally to z^2013. That gives\\n\\nL_S = |z^3 - z| + |z^5 - z^3| + … + |z^2013 - z^{2011}| = |z^2 - 1| (r + r^3 + … + r^{2011}).\\n\\nThis is a geometric series with odd exponents from 1 to 2011: r + r^3 + … + r^{2011} = r(1 + r^2 + r^4 + … + r^{2010}). Note 2010 = 2·1005, so there are 1006 terms in the even-exponent series.\\n\\nOn Sunday: points are 1, z^2, z^4, …, z^2012. Distances between successive points are |z^2 - 1|, |z^4 - z^2|, …, |z^2012 - z^{2010}|. For k ≥ 1, |z^{2k} - z^{2(k-1)}| = |z^{2(k-1)}| |z^2 - 1| = r^{2(k-1)} |z^2 - 1|. For the first segment, |z^2 - 1| is the distance from 1 to z^2, so the Sunday path length L_U equals\\n\\nL_U = |z^2 - 1| (1 + r^2 + r^4 + … + r^{2010}).\\n\\nWe are told that L_S = L_U and that the distance from starting point to the last house is √2012 on both days. First, equate path lengths:\\n\\n|z^2 - 1| (r + r^3 + … + r^{2011}) = |z^2 - 1| (1 + r^2 + … + r^{2010}).\\n\\nIf |z^2 - 1| ≠ 0, we cancel it, getting r + r^3 + … + r^{2011} = 1 + r^2 + … + r^{2010}. Rewrite the left side as r(1 + r^2 + … + r^{2010}). Then the equation is\\n\\nr(1 + r^2 + … + r^{2010}) = 1 + r^2 + … + r^{2010}.\\n\\nLet S = 1 + r^2 + … + r^{2010}. Then rS = S. Either S = 0 or r = 1. r ≥ 0 by definition, and S is a finite sum of nonnegative terms with first term 1, so S > 0, so we must have r = 1.\\n\\nBut we also use the condition that the distance from starting point to last house is √2012 on both days. On Saturday, that distance is |z^{2013} - z| = |z||z^{2012} - 1| = r |z^{2012} - 1|. On Sunday, the distance from 1 to z^{2012} is |z^{2012} - 1|. Given they are both √2012, we get |z^{2012} - 1| = √2012 and r |z^{2012} - 1| = √2012, so r√2012 = √2012, again giving r = 1 as long as |z^{2012} - 1| ≠ 0. That matches the previous conclusion.\\n\\nTherefore |z| = 1 and k = |z| - 1 = 0.\\n\\nNext we solve the number theory/combinatorics part. Bob's Rice ID number is a six-digit number, each digit from 1 to 9 (no zeros), and digits may repeat. Let the six-digit number be N = d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 in decimal (d1 is the first digit, etc.). The conditions are:\\n\\n1) The first two digits (number 10 d1 + d2) ≡ k mod 2. Since k = 0, we have 10 d1 + d2 ≡ 0 (mod 2).\\n2) The first three digits (100 d1 + 10 d2 + d3) ≡ 0 (mod 3).\\n3) The first four digits (1000 d1 + 100 d2 + 10 d3 + d4) ≡ 0 (mod 4).\\n4) The first five digits (10000 d1 + 1000 d2 + 100 d3 + 10 d4 + d5) ≡ 0 (mod 5).\\n5) The whole ID number N ≡ 0 (mod 6).\\n\\nEach di is in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. Example 123252 is given as one valid solution.\\n\\nWe translate each modulus condition via simple divisibility rules:\\n\\nCondition (1), mod 2: 10d1 is even always, so 10d1 + d2 ≡ d2 (mod 2). That must be 0, so d2 must be even: d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8}.\\n\\nCondition (2), mod 3: Divisibility by 3 depends on digit sum. For the three-digit number 100 d1 + 10 d2 + d3, the sum of digits is d1 + d2 + d3. So d1 + d2 + d3 ≡ 0 (mod 3).\\n\\nCondition (3), mod 4: A number is divisible by 4 iff its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For the first four-digit number, the last two digits are d3 d4, so 10 d3 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 4).\\n\\nCondition (4), mod 5: A base-10 integer is divisible by 5 iff its last digit is 0 or 5. We cannot use 0, so for the five-digit prefix to be divisible by 5, d5 must be 5.\\n\\nCondition (5), mod 6: A number divisible by 6 must be divisible by both 2 and 3. For N to be even, its last digit d6 must be even: d6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}. For divisibility by 3, the sum of digits d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 must be ≡ 0 (mod 3).\\n\\nNow we count the number of 6-digit sequences (d1,…,d6) with di ∈ {1,…,9} satisfying:\\n\\n(A) d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8};\\n(B) d1 + d2 + d3 ≡ 0 (mod 3);\\n(C) 10 d3 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 4);\\n(D) d5 = 5;\\n(E) d6 ∈ {2,4,6,8};\\n(F) d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 ≡ 0 (mod 3).\\n\\nWe start by analyzing condition (C), the (d3,d4) pairing such that 10d3 + d4 is a two-digit multiple of 4 using digits 1–9.\\n\\nList all pairs (d3,d4) with d3,d4 ∈ {1,…,9} and 10 d3 + d4 divisible by 4. We can quickly compute allowed last digits mod 4 depending on 10 d3 mod 4. 10 ≡ 2 (mod 4), so 10d3 ≡ 2d3 (mod 4). Then (2d3 + d4) ≡ 0 (mod 4). For each d3, we deduce allowed d4 among 1–9.\\n\\nCompute d3 modulo 2 because 2d3 mod 4 only depends on d3's parity:\\n- If d3 is even: d3 = 2,4,6,8. Then 2d3 ≡ 0 (mod 4). The condition is d4 ≡ 0 (mod 4). So d4 ∈ {4,8}.\\n- If d3 is odd: d3 = 1,3,5,7,9. Then 2d3 ≡ 2 (mod 4). The condition is 2 + d4 ≡ 0 (mod 4), so d4 ≡ 2 (mod 4). Among digits 1–9, this gives d4 ∈ {2,6}.\\n\\nSo total (d3,d4) possibilities: for even d3 (2,4,6,8): 4 choices for d3 × 2 choices for d4 = 8 pairs. For odd d3 (1,3,5,7,9): 5 × 2 = 10 pairs. Overall 18 possible (d3,d4) pairs.\\n\\nNext we use the mod-3 constraints involving d1,d2,d3,d4,d6. Let S3 = d1 + d2 + d3 and S6 = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6.\\n\\nFrom (B), we have S3 ≡ 0 (mod 3). From (F), S6 ≡ 0 (mod 3). Subtracting the two congruences gives\\n\\nS6 - S3 = d4 + d5 + d6 ≡ 0 (mod 3) - 0 (mod 3) = 0 (mod 3).\\n\\nSo we also require d4 + d5 + d6 ≡ 0 (mod 3). We know d5 = 5, which is 2 (mod 3). Therefore d4 + d6 + 2 ≡ 0 (mod 3), so d4 + d6 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\\n\\nThus the mod-3 conditions split into: (B) d1 + d2 + d3 ≡ 0 (mod 3) and (B') d4 + d6 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Having S3 ≡ 0 and B' together implies S6 ≡ 0 mod 3 as desired.\\n\\nWe now separate the counting into two independent parts:\\n\\n1) Choice of (d1,d2,d3) such that d2 is even and S3 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\n2) Choice of (d3,d4,d6) fitting condition (C) on (d3,d4), d6 even, and d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3.\\n\\nHowever, d3 links these two parts, so we treat them together over the 9 possible d3 values.\\n\\nLet us take each possible d3 from 1 to 9 and compute valid counts for (d1,d2) from S3 condition, and (d4,d6) from mod4 and the mod3 relations. Then multiply and sum.\\n\\nFirst, handle (d1,d2,d3) with d2 even and S3 ≡ 0 (mod 3). For a fixed d3 and a fixed residue of d2 mod 3, the condition on d1 is determined. We'll compute generally.\\n\\nPossible digits for d2: {2,4,6,8}. Modulo 3:\\n- 2 ≡ 2,\\n- 4 ≡ 1,\\n- 6 ≡ 0,\\n- 8 ≡ 2.\\n\\nSo the residues for d2 are {2,1,0,2}. For any chosen d2 and fixed d3, we want d1 ≡ -d2 - d3 (mod 3). Among digits 1–9, exactly 3 digits lie in each residue class mod 3: {1,4,7} ≡ 1, {2,5,8} ≡ 2, {3,6,9} ≡ 0. So for any fixed (d2,d3), there are exactly 3 possible d1 making S3 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\n\\nThus, for each d3 and for each of the 4 allowed values of d2, we get 3 choices for d1. So for each d3, the number of valid (d1,d2) pairs is 4×3 = 12.\\n\\nNow we count the combinations (d4,d6) for each fixed d3 under:\\n- d4 satisfies the mod4 condition with d3, i.e. if d3 even, d4 ∈ {4,8}; if d3 odd, d4 ∈ {2,6}.\\n- d6 is even: d6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}.\\n- d4 + d6 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\\n\\nWe consider d3 parity cases.\\n\\nCase 1: d3 is even: d3 ∈ {2,4,6,8}. Then d4 ∈ {4,8}. Compute d4 mod 3:\\n- 4 ≡ 1,\\n- 8 ≡ 2.\\n\\nd6 ∈ {2,4,6,8} with residues:\\n- 2 ≡ 2,\\n- 4 ≡ 1,\\n- 6 ≡ 0,\\n- 8 ≡ 2.\\n\\nWe need d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3. Let r4 = d4 mod 3 and r6 = d6 mod 3. Then r4 + r6 ≡ 1 (mod 3). For each choice of d4 we count valid d6.\\n\\nFor d4 = 4 (r4 = 1), we need r6 ≡ 0 (mod 3) to make 1 + r6 ≡ 1, so r6 must be 0. The only d6 with residue 0 is 6. So with d4=4, valid d6 is {6}.\\n\\nFor d4 = 8 (r4 = 2), we need 2 + r6 ≡ 1 (mod 3) → r6 ≡ 2 (since 2 + 2 = 4 ≡ 1). So r6 must be 2. The digits in {2,4,6,8} with residue 2 are 2 and 8. So with d4=8, valid d6 ∈ {2,8}.\\n\\nTherefore for each even d3, number of (d4,d6) pairs is:\\n- For d4=4: 1 choice d6,\\n- For d4=8: 2 choices d6,\\nTotal = 3 pairs.\\n\\nThere are 4 even d3 values (2,4,6,8), each contributing 3 pairs, for a total of 4×3 = 12 (d3,d4,d6) triples for even d3.\\n\\nCase 2: d3 is odd: d3 ∈ {1,3,5,7,9}. Then d4 ∈ {2,6}. Their mod 3 residues:\\n- 2 ≡ 2,\\n- 6 ≡ 0.\\n\\nd6 ∈ {2,4,6,8} with residues as before: 2,1,0,2.\\n\\nAgain require d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3.\\n\\nFor d4 = 2 (r4 = 2): Condition 2 + r6 ≡ 1 (mod 3) → r6 ≡ 2. So d6 must be 2 or 8.\\n\\nFor d4 = 6 (r4 = 0): Condition 0 + r6 ≡ 1 (mod 3) → r6 ≡ 1. So d6 must be 4.\\n\\nThus for each odd d3 we have:\\n- d4 = 2 with d6 ∈ {2,8} (2 options),\\n- d4 = 6 with d6 = 4 (1 option),\\nTotal = 3 (d4,d6) pairs.\\n\\nThere are 5 odd d3 values, each contributing 3 pairs, for a total of 5×3 = 15 (d3,d4,d6) triples for odd d3.\\n\\nFor counting all possible IDs, for each fixed d3 we multiply the number of (d1,d2) choices (always 12) by the number of (d4,d6) choices for that d3. From above, for any d3 (odd or even) the number of (d4,d6) pairs is 3. This is a useful symmetry: every d3 gives exactly 3 pairs.\\n\\nSo for each of the 9 possible d3 values, we have 12 × 3 = 36 choices for (d1,d2,d4,d6) given d3. d5 is fixed as 5.\\n\\nTotal number of valid ID numbers = sum over 9 values of d3 of 36 = 9 × 36 = 324.\\n\\nWe can sanity-check by seeing that the given example 123252 fits these rules: d1=1,d2=2,d3=3,d4=2,d5=5,d6=2. Here d2=2 (even), d5=5, d6=2 (even), 10·1+2=12 even, 100·1+10·2+3=123 sum 1+2+3=6 divisible by 3, last two digits of first four digits are 32 divisible by 4, 12325 ends in 5 so divisible by 5, and 123252 ends in 2 and digit sum is 1+2+3+2+5+2=15, divisible by 3 and 2, hence by 6.\\n\\nAll counts and modular restrictions are consistent, and no other constraints apply. Hence the total number of valid IDs is 324.\",\n    \"answer\": \"324\"\n}",
