  "math_problem": "Storage space on a computer is measured in gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB), where $1 \\mathrm{~GB} = 1024 \\mathrm{MB}$. Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Let $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes. The regular price for a bicycle is $\\\\$320$. The bicycle is on sale for $20\\\\%$ off. The regular price for a helmet is $\\\\$80$. The helmet is on sale for $10\\\\%$ off. If Sandra bought both items on sale, her percentage savings on the total purchase is $\\left( \\frac{\\text{total savings}}{\\text{total price}} \\right) \\times d\\\\%$. Compute this value.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"1) Convert hard drive capacity to MB. Given 1 GB = 1024 MB and the drive is 300 GB, total capacity C in MB is C = 300 × 1024 = 307200 MB. 2) Define d = C − 307100. Substitute C = 307200 to get d = 307200 − 307100 = 100. 3) Storage space remaining: Julia puts 300000 MB on the drive, so remaining empty space is 307200 − 300000 = 7200 MB. This value, however, is not directly needed for the later percent savings expression; the problem only uses d in the percentage formula. 4) Bicycle and helmet sale details: Regular bicycle price = $320; 20% off means savings of 0.20 × 320 = 64, so sale price is 320 − 64 = 256. Regular helmet price = $80; 10% off means savings of 0.10 × 80 = 8, so sale price is 80 − 8 = 72. 5) Total savings and total regular price: Total savings = 64 + 8 = 72. Total regular price (total price in the denominator) = 320 + 80 = 400. 6) Sandra’s percentage savings without the d factor would be (total savings / total price) × 100% = (72 / 400) × 100% = 18%. 7) The problem defines Sandra’s percentage savings on the total purchase as ((total savings) / (total price)) × d%. We already have total savings / total price = 72 / 400 = 0.18, and d = 100, so this becomes 0.18 × 100% = 18%. 8) Therefore, the requested computed value is 18.\",\n    \"answer\": \"18\"\n}",
