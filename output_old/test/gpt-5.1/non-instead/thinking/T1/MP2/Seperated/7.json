The total angle around a point is 360°.\\n\\n1) Set up the equation for the sum of central angles:\\n   4x + 20 + 140 = 360.\\n2) Simplify:\\n   4x + 160 = 360\\n   4x = 200\\n   x = 50.\\n3) So the four equal regions each have angle 50°. The two remaining regions are 20° and 140°.\\n4) The problem statement asks for the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region, but it does not explicitly say which regions are shaded. The standard interpretation (from typical contest problems of this form) is that the four equal regions are shaded and the 20° and 140° regions are unshaded. Under that interpretation, the shaded portion is the union of the four 50° regions.\\n5) Total shaded angle = 4 × 50° = 200°.\\n6) Probability = shaded angle / total angle = 200° / 360° = 5/9.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe need the number of positive integers k ≤ 2940 such that (205800, 35k) is a happy pair, meaning gcd(205800, 35k) is a perfect square.\\n\\n1) Factor the fixed numbers:\\n   - 35 = 5 × 7.\\n   - Factor 205800:\\n     205800 = 2058 × 100.\\n     100 = 2² × 5².\\n     Factor 2058:\\n       2058 ÷ 2 = 1029\\n       1029 = 3 × 343\\n       343 = 7³\\n     so 2058 = 2 × 3 × 7³.\\n     Therefore 205800 = (2 × 3 × 7³) × (2² × 5²) = 2³ × 3¹ × 5² × 7³.\\n   So:\\n   205800 = 2^3 · 3^1 · 5^2 · 7^3.\\n   35 = 5^1 · 7^1.\\n\\n2) Let the prime factorization of k be:\\n   k = 2^a · 3^b · 5^c · 7^d · r,\\n   where r is coprime to 2, 3, 5, 7 (i.e., contains only primes other than 2,3,5,7).\\n\\n3) Then 35k = 5^1 · 7^1 · k = 2^a · 3^b · 5^{c+1} · 7^{d+1} · r.\\n\\n4) The gcd exponent for each prime p is the minimum of its exponent in 205800 and in 35k.\\n   - For p = 2:\\n     205800 has exponent 3. 35k has exponent a.\\n     So e2 = min(3, a).\\n   - For p = 3:\\n     205800 has exponent 1. 35k has exponent b.\\n     So e3 = min(1, b).\\n   - For p = 5:\\n     205800 has exponent 2. 35k has exponent c+1.\\n     So e5 = min(2, c+1).\\n   - For p = 7:\\n     205800 has exponent 3. 35k has exponent d+1.\\n     So e7 = min(3, d+1).\\n   - For any prime in r (not 2,3,5,7), 205800 has exponent 0, so the gcd exponent is 0. Those primes do not affect whether the gcd is a perfect square.\\n\\n5) Condition for gcd to be a perfect square:\\n   All exponents e2, e3, e5, e7 must be even.\\n\\n6) Analyze each prime separately.\\n\\n   For p = 2:\\n   - e2 = min(3, a) must be even.\\n   Possible values of a:\\n     • If a = 0 → e2 = 0 (even) OK.\\n     • If a = 1 → e2 = 1 (odd) NOT allowed.\\n     • If a = 2 → e2 = 2 (even) OK.\\n     • If a ≥ 3 → e2 = 3 (odd) NOT allowed.\\n   So allowed a are 0 or 2.\\n\\n   For p = 3:\\n   - e3 = min(1, b) must be even.\\n   Cases:\\n     • If b = 0 → e3 = 0 (even) OK.\\n     • If b ≥ 1 → e3 = 1 (odd) NOT allowed.\\n   So b must be 0. That means 3 does not divide k.\\n\\n   For p = 5:\\n   - e5 = min(2, c+1) must be even.\\n   Consider c:\\n     • c = 0 → 35k has 5^{1} → e5 = min(2,1) = 1 (odd) NOT allowed.\\n     • c = 1 → 35k has 5^{2} → e5 = min(2,2) = 2 (even) OK.\\n     • c ≥ 2 → 35k has 5^{c+1} with c+1 ≥ 3 → e5 = min(2, c+1) = 2 (even) OK.\\n   So c ≥ 1 is required.\\n\\n   For p = 7:\\n   - e7 = min(3, d+1) must be even.\\n   Consider d:\\n     • d = 0 → d+1 = 1 → e7 = 1 (odd) NOT allowed.\\n     • d = 1 → d+1 = 2 → e7 = min(3,2) = 2 (even) OK.\\n     • d = 2 → d+1 = 3 → e7 = 3 (odd) NOT allowed.\\n     • d ≥ 3 → d+1 ≥ 4 → e7 = min(3, d+1) = 3 (odd) NOT allowed.\\n   So the only allowed value is d = 1.\\n\\n7) Summarize the exponent constraints:\\n   - a ∈ {0, 2}.\\n   - b = 0.\\n   - c ≥ 1.\\n   - d = 1.\\n   - r is any product of primes not in {2,3,5,7}, as long as k ≤ 2940.\\n\\nBut we must impose k ≤ 2940, which restricts possible exponents and the factor r. A direct way is to classify k based on the allowed exponents and then count.\\n\\nLet k = 2^a · 5^c · 7 · r, with a ∈ {0,2}, c ≥ 1, r coprime to 2,3,5,7, and k ≤ 2940.\\n\\n8) Handle the case a = 0 separately from a = 2.\\n\\nCase 1: a = 0\\n   Then k = 5^c · 7 · r.\\n   So base factor from 5 and 7 is 7·5^c.\\n   Let T = 7 · 5^c. Then r can be any positive integer coprime to 2,3,5,7, such that T · r ≤ 2940.\\n\\n   We need to find feasible c.\\n   As c ≥ 1, compute maximum c such that 7·5^c ≤ 2940.\\n   - c = 1 → 7·5 = 35 ≤ 2940.\\n   - c = 2 → 7·25 = 175 ≤ 2940.\\n   - c = 3 → 7·125 = 875 ≤ 2940.\\n   - c = 4 → 7·625 = 4375 > 2940.\\n   So c ∈ {1,2,3}.\\n\\n   For each c, we must count r such that:\\n     • r is a positive integer,\\n     • gcd(r, 2·3·5·7) = 1 (i.e., r not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7),\\n     • r ≤ 2940 / T.\\n\\n   Let N_c = floor(2940 / T). Then number of r ≤ N_c coprime to 2,3,5,7 is N_c times φ(210)/210, but only if N_c is large and exact multiples may not align. To avoid mistakes, compute directly using inclusion-exclusion or the fact that numbers not divisible by 2,3,5,7 follow a periodic pattern of length 210.\\n\\n   Because 210 = 2·3·5·7, the density of numbers coprime to 2,3,5,7 is φ(210)/210.\\n   Compute φ(210):\\n     φ(210) = 210 × (1 - 1/2) × (1 - 1/3) × (1 - 1/5) × (1 - 1/7)\\n             = 210 × (1/2) × (2/3) × (4/5) × (6/7).\\n     Simplify stepwise:\\n       210 × 1/2 = 105\\n       105 × 2/3 = 70\\n       70 × 4/5 = 56\\n       56 × 6/7 = 48.\\n   So φ(210) = 48. That means in every block of 210 consecutive positive integers, exactly 48 are coprime to 2,3,5,7.\\n\\n   We can count r up to N_c by decomposing N_c = 210q + s with 0 ≤ s < 210.\\n   Then number of r ≤ N_c coprime to 2,3,5,7 = 48q + (count in remainder 1..s).\\n   The remainder count requires listing or precomputing which residues modulo 210 are coprime to 2,3,5,7. However, N_c will be fairly small, making a direct enumeration feasible mentally:\\n\\n   Compute T and N_c for each c.\\n\\n   For c = 1:\\n     T = 7·5 = 35.\\n     N_1 = floor(2940 / 35) = floor(84) = 84.\\n     So r ∈ [1, 84], gcd(r, 210) = 1.\\n     Now count numbers from 1 to 84 that are not divisible by 2,3,5,7.\\n\\n     Use inclusion-exclusion:\\n       Total in [1,84] = 84.\\n       A2: multiples of 2: floor(84/2) = 42.\\n       A3: multiples of 3: floor(84/3) = 28.\\n       A5: multiples of 5: floor(84/5) = 16.\\n       A7: multiples of 7: floor(84/7) = 12.\\n       Pairwise intersections:\\n         A2∩A3 (6): floor(84/6) = 14.\\n         A2∩A5 (10): floor(84/10) = 8.\\n         A2∩A7 (14): floor(84/14) = 6.\\n         A3∩A5 (15): floor(84/15) = 5.\\n         A3∩A7 (21): floor(84/21) = 4.\\n         A5∩A7 (35): floor(84/35) = 2.\\n       Triple intersections:\\n         A2∩A3∩A5 (30): floor(84/30) = 2.\\n         A2∩A3∩A7 (42): floor(84/42) = 2.\\n         A2∩A5∩A7 (70): floor(84/70) = 1.\\n         A3∩A5∩A7 (105): floor(84/105) = 0.\\n       Quadruple intersection:\\n         A2∩A3∩A5∩A7 (210): floor(84/210) = 0.\\n\\n     By inclusion-exclusion, count of numbers divisible by at least one of 2,3,5,7 is:\\n       S1 = 42 + 28 + 16 + 12 = 98.\\n       S2 = 14 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 39.\\n       S3 = 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 5.\\n       S4 = 0.\\n       Total divisible = S1 - S2 + S3 - S4 = 98 - 39 + 5 = 64.\\n     Then numbers not divisible by any of them = 84 - 64 = 20.\\n\\n     So for c = 1, there are 20 valid r.\\n\\n   For c = 2:\\n     T = 7 · 25 = 175.\\n     N_2 = floor(2940 / 175) = floor(16.8) = 16.\\n     So r ∈ [1, 16], gcd(r, 210) = 1.\\n\\n     Count numbers from 1 to 16 not divisible by 2,3,5,7.\\n     List them quickly:\\n       1 (OK), 2(x2), 3(x3), 4(x2), 5(x5), 6(x2,3), 7(x7), 8(x2), 9(x3), 10(x2,5),\\n       11(OK), 12(x2,3), 13(OK), 14(x2,7), 15(x3,5), 16(x2).\\n     Good r: 1, 11, 13 → 3 numbers.\\n     So for c = 2, there are 3 valid r.\\n\\n   For c = 3:\\n     T = 7 · 125 = 875.\\n     N_3 = floor(2940 / 875) = floor(3.36) = 3.\\n     So r ∈ [1, 3], gcd(r, 210) = 1.\\n\\n     Check 1,2,3:\\n       1 (OK)\\n       2 (divisible by 2)\\n       3 (divisible by 3)\\n     So only r = 1 works → 1 value.\\n\\n   Thus, for a = 0 (no factor of 2 in k), total valid k equals:\\n     20 + 3 + 1 = 24.\\n\\nCase 2: a = 2\\n   Then k = 2^2 · 5^c · 7 · r = 4 · 5^c · 7 · r.\\n   Let T' = 4 · 5^c · 7.\\n   As before, c ≥ 1 and r coprime to 2,3,5,7.\\n   Need T' · r ≤ 2940.\\n\\n   Find allowed c:\\n     c = 1 → T' = 4 · 5 · 7 = 140 ≤ 2940.\\n     c = 2 → T' = 4 · 25 · 7 = 700 ≤ 2940.\\n     c = 3 → T' = 4 · 125 · 7 = 3500 > 2940.\\n   So c ∈ {1,2}.\\n\\n   For each c, r is positive integer, gcd(r, 210) = 1, and r ≤ floor(2940 / T').\\n\\n   For c = 1:\\n     T' = 140.\\n     N'_1 = floor(2940 / 140) = floor(21) = 21.\\n     r ∈ [1,21], gcd(r,210) = 1.\\n\\n     Count numbers between 1 and 21 not divisible by 2,3,5,7.\\n     List:\\n       1 (OK)\\n       2 (×2)\\n       3 (×3)\\n       4 (×2)\\n       5 (×5)\\n       6 (×2,3)\\n       7 (×7)\\n       8 (×2)\\n       9 (×3)\\n       10 (×2,5)\\n       11 (OK)\\n       12 (×2,3)\\n       13 (OK)\\n       14 (×2,7)\\n       15 (×3,5)\\n       16 (×2)\\n       17 (OK)\\n       18 (×2,3)\\n       19 (OK)\\n       20 (×2,5)\\n       21 (×3,7).\\n     Good r: 1, 11, 13, 17, 19 → 5 numbers.\\n\\n   For c = 2:\\n     T' = 700.\\n     N'_2 = floor(2940 / 700) = floor(4.2) = 4.\\n     r ∈ [1,4], gcd(r,210) = 1.\\n     Check 1,2,3,4:\\n       1 (OK)\\n       2 (×2)\\n       3 (×3)\\n       4 (×2)\\n     Only r = 1 works → 1 value.\\n\\n   Thus, for a = 2, total valid k = 5 + 1 = 6.\\n\\n9) There are no other valid a, so the total number of k satisfying the gcd condition and k ≤ 2940 is:\\n   24 (from a = 0) + 6 (from a = 2) = 30.\\n\\n10) Therefore, the answer to Problem 2 is 30.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\n - Problem 1: 5/9.\\n - Problem 2: 30.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"5/9\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"30\"\n}",
