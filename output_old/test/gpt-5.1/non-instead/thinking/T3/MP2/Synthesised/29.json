  "math_problem": "Find all prime numbers $p,q,r$ , such that $\\frac{p}{q}-\\frac{4}{r+1}=1$ Let $n = r + 2009$, where $r$ is the prime number such that $r + 1$ equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term. FemtoPravis is walking on an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard that wraps around at its edges (so squares on the left edge of the chessboard are adjacent to squares on the right edge, and similarly for the top and bottom edges). Each femtosecond, FemtoPravis moves in one of the four diagonal directions uniformly at random. After $n$ femtoseconds, what is the probability that FemtoPravis is at his original location?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We first solve the Diophantine equation with primes p,q,r:\\n\\np/q - 4/(r+1) = 1.\\n\\nRewrite:\\n(p/q) - 1 = 4/(r+1)\\n(p - q)/q = 4/(r+1).\\n\\nCross-multiply:\\n(p - q)(r + 1) = 4q.\\n\\nSince p,q,r are primes and r+1>2, r must be 2 (because otherwise r+1 is an odd composite or 4, but we test the small cases). Set r=2, so r+1=3:\\n(p - q)*3 = 4q -> 3p - 3q = 4q -> 3p = 7q -> p = 7q/3.\\nFor p to be integer and prime, q must be a multiple of 3; the only prime multiple of 3 is q=3, giving p=7. Check:\\n7/3 - 4/(2+1) = 7/3 - 4/3 = 1, valid.\\n\\nThus the only prime triple is (p,q,r) = (7,3,2).\\n\\nWe are told to take r as the prime such that r+1 equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term 4/(r+1); by the equation that is the same r we just found, so r=2 and\\nn = r + 2009 = 2 + 2009 = 2011.\\n\\nNow we consider FemtoPravis on an 8×8 toroidal chessboard (coordinates modulo 8). Each step he moves one square in one of the four diagonal directions with equal probability: NE, NW, SE, SW.\\n\\nModel the move in coordinates (x,y) modulo 8:\\nNE: (x+1, y+1)\\nNW: (x-1, y+1)\\nSE: (x+1, y-1)\\nSW: (x-1, y-1).\\n\\nObserve parity constraints. Starting at (0,0), after one diagonal step we are at (±1, ±1); both coordinates are odd. Every step changes x by ±1 and y by ±1, so the parity of x flips each step, and the parity of y also flips each step. Therefore:\\n- After an even number of steps, x and y are even.\\n- After an odd number of steps, x and y are odd.\\n\\nThe starting position (0,0) has both coordinates even. To be back at the original location after n steps, we must have even n; otherwise at least one of the coordinates has odd parity, so the position differs from (0,0). Since n=2011 is odd, there is no possible path that returns to the starting square at step 2011.\\n\\nHence the probability of being at the original location after n=2011 femtoseconds is 0 (exactly).\",  \n    \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
