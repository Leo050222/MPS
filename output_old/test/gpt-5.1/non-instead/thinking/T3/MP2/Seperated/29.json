  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe need primes p,q,r such that p/q - 4/(r+1) = 1.\\nRewrite:\\n p/q = 1 + 4/(r+1) = (r+1+4)/(r+1) = (r+5)/(r+1).\\nSo p/q = (r+5)/(r+1). In lowest terms, p and q must be primes.\\nLet d = gcd(r+5, r+1). Then d = gcd(r+5 - (r+1), r+1) = gcd(4, r+1).\\nSince r is an odd prime > 2, r+1 is even. Possible values of d are 1,2,4.\\nWe need the reduced fraction (r+5)/(r+1) to have prime numerator and denominator.\\nCase d=1: fraction already reduced, so p = r+5, q = r+1 must both be prime. But then q odd implies q+4 even > 2, so p even composite; impossible.\\nCase d=2: then r+1 is divisible by 2 but not by 4; so r+1 ≡ 2 (mod 4) ⇒ r ≡ 1 (mod 4).\\nThen (r+5)/(r+1) reduces to ((r+5)/2)/((r+1)/2). Put P = (r+5)/2, Q = (r+1)/2. We need P,Q prime.\\nNote P-Q = 2, so they are twin primes.\\nWe also need both P and Q odd primes. If Q is odd, then r+1 = 2Q ≡ 2 (mod 4) ⇒ Q odd; then P = Q+2 is also odd. So both are odd primes.\\nThus we look for odd primes Q such that Q and Q+2 are twin primes, and r = 2Q-1 is also prime (since r itself must be prime).\\nTest small twin prime pairs (3,5): Q=3,P=5,r = 2*3-1=5 (prime). Then p=P=5, q=Q=3, r=5. Check: 5/3 - 4/(5+1) = 5/3 - 4/6 = 5/3 - 2/3 = 1; works.\\nNext twin primes (5,7): Q=5,P=7,r=2*5-1=9 not prime.\\n(11,13): r=2*11-1=21 not prime.\\n(17,19): r=33 not prime.\\nModulo 3 argument forbids further solutions: for Q>3, any odd prime Q is ≡ ±1 (mod 6). If Q≡1 (mod 6), then Q+2≡3 (mod 6) and thus divisible by 3, so cannot be prime except 3; if Q≡5 (mod 6), then Q itself ≡ -1 (mod 6) but then Q+2 ≡1 (mod 6) is OK. However we also require r=2Q-1 prime. Check r modulo 3: If Q≡2 (mod 3), then r≡2*2-1≡3≡0 (mod 3) so r composite unless r=3, which would give Q=2, not allowed (2 is not odd). Therefore Q must be 3 for all simultaneous conditions; that gives the only solution.\\nCase d=4: then r+1 ≡0 (mod 4) ⇒ r≡3 (mod 4). Then writing r+1=4k, r+5=4k+4=4(k+1), the reduced fraction is (k+1)/k. These differ by 1, so they cannot both be \\u22652; hence no solution with primes.\\nThus the only prime triple solution is (p,q,r) = (5,3,5).\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have an 8x8 toroidal grid. FemtoPravis moves one step diagonally each femtosecond, equally likely among 4 diagonals.\\nRepresent positions as (x,y) in Z_8 x Z_8. A diagonal move changes parity of both x and y: moves are (±1,±1). So after each step, the parity of x flips, and parity of y flips. Thus after n steps, parity(x) and parity(y) change by n mod 2.\\nTo return to original location, we must match both coordinates modulo 8. In particular, the parity must match. That requires n even. If n is odd, the parity has flipped (since one flip per step), and position cannot equal the start.\\nGiven n=2012, which is even, the parity condition holds, so returning is possible; but we need exact probability.\\nBecause the board is a Cayley graph of Z_8 x Z_8 with symmetric step set, the random walk is a group random walk. The probability of return after n steps is the coefficient of the identity in the n-th convolution power of the step distribution. By discrete Fourier transform on the finite abelian group, this equals the average over all group characters of the n-th power of the step characteristic function.\\nThe step set S consists of 4 moves: (1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1) in coordinates modulo 8. For a character indexed by (a,b) in Z_8 x Z_8, the eigenvalue (Fourier transform) is\\n λ(a,b) = (1/4) * [ e^{2πi(a*1 + b*1)/8} + e^{2πi(a*1 + b*(-1))/8} + e^{2πi(a*(-1)+ b*1)/8} + e^{2πi(a*(-1)+ b*(-1))/8}].\\nGroup them:\\n First and last: exponents (a+b) and (-(a+b)) give 2 cos(2π(a+b)/8), divided by 4 → (1/2) cos(2π(a+b)/8).\\n Middle pair: exponents (a-b) and (b-a)=-(a-b) give 2 cos(2π(a-b)/8), divided by 4 → (1/2) cos(2π(a-b)/8).\\nTherefore λ(a,b) = 1/2[cos(2π(a+b)/8) + cos(2π(a-b)/8)].\\nUsing cosA+cosB = 2 cos((A+B)/2) cos((A-B)/2), let A = 2π(a+b)/8, B = 2π(a-b)/8, so\\n (A+B)/2 = 2πa/8, (A-B)/2 = 2πb/8. Then\\n λ(a,b) = cos(2πa/8) * cos(2πb/8) = cos(πa/4) cos(πb/4).\\nThe return probability after n steps is\\n P_n = (1/|G|) Σ_{(a,b) in Z_8^2} λ(a,b)^n = (1/64) Σ_{a=0}^7 Σ_{b=0}^7 [cos(πa/4) cos(πb/4)]^n.\\nThis factorizes:\\n P_n = (1/64) [Σ_{a=0}^7 cos^n(πa/4)]^2.\\nThus we need S_n = Σ_{k=0}^7 cos^n(πk/4). Note cos values for k=0..7 are {1, √2/2, 0, -√2/2, -1, -√2/2, 0, √2/2}.\\nLet c = cos(π/4) = √2/2.\\nThen S_n = 1^n + c^n + 0^n + (-c)^n + (-1)^n + (-c)^n + 0^n + c^n.\\nFor n>0, 0^n=0. Grouping:\\n S_n = 1 + (-1)^n + 2 c^n + 2 (-c)^n.\\nIf n is odd, (-1)^n = -1 and c^n + (-c)^n = c^n - c^n = 0, so S_n = 1-1+0=0.\\nIf n is even, write n = 2m. Then (-1)^n=1, and (-c)^n = c^n, so c^n + (-c)^n = 2 c^n. Thus\\n S_{2m} = 1+1+2 c^{2m} + 2 c^{2m} = 2 + 4 c^{2m}.\\nSince c^2 = ( (√2)/2 )^2 = 1/2, we get c^{2m} = (1/2)^m.\\nSo S_{2m} = 2 + 4*(1/2)^m.\\nTherefore, when n is even:\\n P_n = (1/64) [S_n]^2 = (1/64) [2 + 4*(1/2)^{n/2}]^2.\\nWhen n is odd, S_n=0 so P_n=0, matching the parity obstruction.\\nWe need n = 2012, so n/2 = 1006.\\nThus S_{2012} = 2 + 4*(1/2)^{1006}.\\nThen\\n P_{2012} = (1/64)(2 + 4*(1/2)^{1006})^2.\\nSimplify rationally:\\nLet t=(1/2)^{1006}.\\nThen S=2+4t. Factor 2: S = 2(1+2t), so S^2 = 4(1+2t)^2 = 4(1+4t+4t^2).\\nThus P = (1/64)*4(1+4t+4t^2) = (1/16)(1+4t+4t^2).\\nNow substitute t=2^{-1006}.\\nSo P = (1/16) + (4/16)2^{-1006} + (4/16)2^{-2012} = 1/16 + (1/4)2^{-1006} + (1/4)2^{-2012}.\\nConvert to a single power of 2:\\n(1/4)2^{-1006} = 2^{-2}2^{-1006} = 2^{-1008}.\\n(1/4)2^{-2012} = 2^{-2}2^{-2012} = 2^{-2014}.\\n1/16 = 2^{-4}.\\nThus P_{2012} = 2^{-4} + 2^{-1008} + 2^{-2014}.\\nThis is already a sum of powers of 2 and is exact. It can be put over a common denominator, but the sum-of-powers form is exact and compact.\\n\\nFinal results:\\nProblem 1: unique prime triple (p,q,r) = (5,3,5).\\nProblem 2: probability after 2012 steps is 2^{-4} + 2^{-1008} + 2^{-2014}.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"(5,3,5)\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"2^-4+2^-1008+2^-2014\"\n}",
