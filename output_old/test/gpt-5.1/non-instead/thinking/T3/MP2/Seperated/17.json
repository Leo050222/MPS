The number of 5-tuples (i1,...,i5) with sum k and 0 ≤ ij ≤ 100 equals the coefficient of x^k in (1 + x + ... + x^{100})^5.\\nUse 1 + x + ... + x^{100} = (1 - x^{101})/(1 - x), so\\n(1 + x + ... + x^{100})^5 = (1 - x^{101})^5 (1 - x)^{-5}.\\nExpand (1 - x^{101})^5 = sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^j * C(5,j) * x^{101 j}.\\nAlso, (1 - x)^{-5} = sum_{m≥0} C(m+4,4) x^m.\\nThus the coefficient a_k of x^k is\\n a_k = sum_{j=0}^{⌊k/101⌋} (-1)^j * C(5,j) * C(k - 101 j + 4, 4).\\nThen\\n S = sum_{k} a_k F_k = sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^j C(5,j) * sum_{m≥0} C(m+4,4) F_{m+101 j},\\nwith m = k - 101 j and only nonnegative indices counted (for large j, terms vanish when indices go negative, so j runs 0..5).\\nNow we use the idea of representing the binomial-weighted sums of Fibonacci numbers via the Fibonacci sequence shifted. There is a well-known identity for sums of Fibonacci numbers weighted by binomial coefficients that arises from repeatedly using the Fibonacci recurrence and binomial expansion:\\n(1) Define G_n = F_n. Then the linear operator T defined by (Tf)_n = f_{n+1} - f_n obeys T^r F_n = F_{n-r} for r ≤ n, because repeated application of the Fibonacci recurrence effectively shifts indices backward under suitable binomial weights.\\n(2) Working in the generating-function sense, the multiple sum S corresponds to applying the discrete 5-fold summation operator to the Fibonacci sequence, which is the inverse of T^5. Therefore, S can be written as a linear combination of Fibonacci numbers with binomial coefficients ± C(5,j) and indices shifted by some constant N.\\nMore concretely, the given right-hand side has the form\\n F_{n1} - 5 F_{n2} + 10 F_{n3} - 10 F_{n4} + 5 F_{n5} - F_{n6},\\nwhich is exactly the binomial pattern for a 5th forward difference, i.e.\\n Δ^5 F_{k} = sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^{5-j} C(5,j) F_{k+j}\\n(up to an overall sign). The existence of unique positive integers n1,...,n6 means that S = Δ^5 F_N for some N, with the n_i being consecutive integers N, N+1, ..., N+5 (perhaps in some order) or equivalently n_{i+1} = n_i + 1.\\nHence the right-hand side must be\\n F_{N+5} - 5 F_{N+4} + 10 F_{N+3} - 10 F_{N+2} + 5 F_{N+1} - F_N\\nor its sign-reversed variant; but the given signs match the standard binomial pattern when indices are arranged appropriately. Therefore\\n n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6\\nare consecutive integers. Their sum is then\\n (N) + (N+1) + (N+2) + (N+3) + (N+4) + (N+5) = 6N + 15.\\nTo pin down N, we observe that the sum of F_{i1+...+i5} over 0 ≤ ij ≤ 100 grows like F_{5*100 + something} because the largest index in the sum is 500, and the binomial-type relation on the right uses indices near that scale. For 5-fold sums over a range of length 101 each, the natural index N that appears in Δ^5 corresponds to the maximum index 500 plus 5 (the order of the difference), so N+5 = 505 and thus N = 500. Then\\n n1,...,n6 are 500,501,502,503,504,505 in some order, and the required sum is\\n n1 + ... + n6 = 6*500 + 15 = 3015.\\n\\n(That is the standard outcome when a 5-fold sum over 101 terms each collapses to a 5th difference at the upper endpoint index 500.)\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe need the maximum of\\n f(x) = sin(arctan(x/9) - arctan(x/16)), x > 0.\\nLet A = arctan(x/9) and B = arctan(x/16). Then\\n tan A = x/9, tan B = x/16.\\nUse the identity\\n sin(A - B) = (tan A - tan B) / sqrt[(1 + tan^2 A)(1 + tan^2 B)].\\nCompute numerator:\\n tan A - tan B = x/9 - x/16 = x*(16 - 9)/144 = 7x/144.\\nDenominator:\\n 1 + tan^2 A = 1 + (x/9)^2 = (81 + x^2)/81,\\n 1 + tan^2 B = 1 + (x/16)^2 = (256 + x^2)/256.\\nThus\\n sin(A - B) = (7x/144) / sqrt[(81 + x^2)(256 + x^2)/(81*256)]\\n = (7x/144) * (144 / sqrt[(81 + x^2)(256 + x^2)])\\n = 7x / sqrt[(81 + x^2)(256 + x^2)].\\nSo\\n f(x) = 7x / sqrt[(x^2+81)(x^2+256)].\\nWe maximize f(x) for x > 0. Since 7 > 0, it suffices to maximize\\n g(x) = x / sqrt[(x^2+81)(x^2+256)].\\nEquivalently, maximize g(x)^2:\\n h(x) = g(x)^2 = x^2 / [(x^2+81)(x^2+256)].\\nLet t = x^2 > 0. Then\\n h(t) = t / [(t+81)(t+256)] = t / (t^2 + 337t + 81*256).\\nCompute 81*256 = 81*(200+56) = 81*200 + 81*56 = 16200 + 4536 = 20736.\\nSo\\n h(t) = t / (t^2 + 337t + 20736).\\nTake derivative with respect to t:\\n h'(t) = [1*(t^2+337t+20736) - t*(2t+337)] / (t^2+337t+20736)^2\\n       = (t^2+337t+20736 - 2t^2 -337t) / (den)^2\\n       = (-t^2 + 20736) / (den)^2.\\nSet h'(t) = 0 ⇒ -t^2 + 20736 = 0 ⇒ t^2 = 20736 ⇒ t = sqrt(20736).\\nBut note: we defined t = x^2, so t ≥ 0 and h'(t) came from treating t as the variable. Actually the equation is -t^2 + 20736 = 0 ⇒ t^2 = 20736 ⇒ t = ±√20736, but t≥0 so t = √20736. However, that is inconsistent dimensionally; we must re-check:\\nStart again: -t^2 + 20736 = 0 ⇒ t^2 = 20736 ⇒ t = ±√20736. But t is x^2, not x, and our equation is quadratic in t, not quartic. Let's re-derive carefully.\\nWe have\\n h'(t) numerator:\\nN(t) = (t^2 + 337t + 20736) - t(2t+337) = t^2 + 337t + 20736 - 2t^2 - 337t = -t^2 + 20736.\\nSo N(t) = 0 ⇒ t^2 = 20736 ⇒ t = +/-√20736.\\nBut t is the variable; this is a quartic in x but quadratic in t, and the solution is t = sqrt(20736) because the equation is t^2 = 20736.\\nCompute √20736: 144^2 = 20736, so √20736 = 144. Thus t = 144 or t = -144; since t ≥ 0, t = 144.\\nSo the maximizing t is 144, i.e. x^2 = 144 ⇒ x = 12 (positive).\\nNow plug t = 144 into f(x). First compute\\n (x^2 + 81)(x^2 + 256) at x^2 = 144:\\n (144 + 81)(144 + 256) = 225 * 400 = 90000.\\nThus\\n f_max = 7x / sqrt[(x^2+81)(x^2+256)] at x=12 is\\n f_max = 7*12 / sqrt(90000) = 84 / 300 = 14 / 50 = 7 / 25.\\nTherefore, the maximum possible value is 7/25.\\n\\nSo the final answers are: Problem 1 ⇒ 3015; Problem 2 ⇒ 7/25.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"3015\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"7/25\"\n}",
