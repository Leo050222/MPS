  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Let $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game. What is the probability that exactly $k$ games will need to be played to determine a winner?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We have a set A with n ≥ 1 elements. The statement “the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of A” means A is partitioned into 2-element subsets (pairs). A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. For such a configuration to exist on A, A must have exactly 2 elements (otherwise a single pair cannot partition A). Thus n = 2. We are given k = n + 5, so k = 2 + 5 = 7. In a best-of-9 series, the first team to 5 wins takes the series. We are asked for the probability that exactly k = 7 games are needed to determine a winner, given that the Mathletes have probability 2/3 to win each game (and their opponent 1/3), independently. The series ends in exactly 7 games if one team reaches its 5th win in game 7, so after 6 games the score must be 4–2 in favor of the eventual winner, and then that team wins game 7. There are two cases: Case 1: Mathletes win the series in 7. They must have 4 wins and 2 losses in the first 6 games, in any order, and then win game 7. Number of sequences for the first 6 games is C(6,4) = 15. The probability of any such specific sequence is (2/3)^4 (1/3)^2, and then they win game 7 with probability 2/3. So P(Mathletes win in 7) = 15 * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3) = 15 * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2. Case 2: Opponent wins the series in 7. They must have 4 wins and 2 losses in the first 6 games, then win game 7. For the opponent, win probability each game is 1/3, lose probability is 2/3. Number of sequences for first 6 games is again C(6,4) = 15. Probability for one such sequence is (1/3)^4 (2/3)^2, then winning game 7 gives another factor 1/3. So P(Opponent wins in 7) = 15 * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3) = 15 * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2. Total probability that exactly 7 games are needed is the sum: 15 * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2 + 15 * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2. Factor out 15 * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2: P = 15 * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2 * [ (2/3)^3 + 1 ]. Compute (1/3)^5 = 1/243 and (2/3)^2 = 4/9, so the factor is 15 * (1/243) * (4/9) = 60 / 2187. Next, (2/3)^3 = 8/27, so (2/3)^3 + 1 = 8/27 + 1 = 35/27. Therefore P = (60 / 2187) * (35 / 27) = (60 * 35) / (2187 * 27) = 2100 / 59049. This fraction does not simplify further (no common factor between 2100 and 59049), so the exact probability that exactly k games are played is 2100/59049.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2100/59049\"\n}",
