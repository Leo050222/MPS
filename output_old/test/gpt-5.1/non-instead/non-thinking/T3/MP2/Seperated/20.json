So B ≥ 0 with equality only at m = n = 0 (which fails the equation because then LHS = 0, RHS = 0, but check: m^5 - n^5 = 0, RHS = 16mn = 0, so (0,0) is indeed a solution). Keep m,n as integers including 0.\\nFirst check simple cases:\\n1) m = 0:\\nThen -n^5 = 16·0·n = 0 ⇒ n^5 = 0 ⇒ n = 0. So (0,0) is a solution.\\n2) n = 0:\\nThen m^5 = 0 ⇒ m = 0, same solution.\\nNow assume mn ≠ 0.\\nWe attempt to exploit symmetry by setting m = kn and solve in terms of n.\\nLet n ≠ 0, set m = kn with k ∈ Q initially. Substitute into m^5 - n^5 = 16mn:\\n(k^5 n^5 - n^5) = 16(k n) n ⇒ n^5(k^5 - 1) = 16 k n^2.\\nAssuming n ≠ 0, divide by n^2:\\nn^3(k^5 - 1) = 16k.\\nThus n^3 = 16k / (k^5 - 1), provided k^5 ≠ 1.\\nFor integer m, n, k = m/n must be rational with denominator dividing n, but also n^3 must be integer, so 16k / (k^5 - 1) must be integer. It’s easier to seek small integer values where k itself is integer, i.e. n divides m.\\nCase k integer (m = kn, gcd(n, k) = 1 or not, but k ∈ Z):\\nn^3 = 16k / (k^5 - 1).\\nThe RHS is rational; since n is integer, RHS must be integer. Let f(k) = 16k / (k^5 - 1). For |k| ≥ 2, |k^5 - 1| grows much faster than 16|k|, so |f(k)| < 1 for |k| ≥ 2. Hence no integer n^3 for |k| ≥ 2.\\nSo only possible integer k values are k = -1, 0, 1.\\n- k = 0: Then m = 0, we already treated; this gave (0,0).\\n- k = 1: Then m = n, so m^5 - n^5 = 0, while RHS = 16m^2. So 0 = 16m^2 ⇒ m = 0 ⇒ again (0,0).\\n- k = -1: Then m = -n. Substitute in original equation:\\n(-n)^5 - n^5 = -n^5 - n^5 = -2n^5, RHS = 16(-n)n = -16n^2.\\nSo -2n^5 = -16n^2 ⇒ 2n^5 = 16n^2 ⇒ divide by 2: n^5 = 8n^2.\\nIf n = 0, we get (0,0). For n ≠ 0, divide by n^2: n^3 = 8 ⇒ n = 2.\\nThen m = -n = -2. So (m, n) = (-2, 2) is a solution.\\nNow we must check that there are no solutions with m/n not integer, but both m, n integers.\\nLet d = gcd(m, n), m = d·a, n = d·b where gcd(a, b) = 1 and a, b ∈ Z.\\nThen equation becomes:\\n(d^5 a^5 - d^5 b^5) = 16(d a)(d b) ⇒ d^5(a^5 - b^5) = 16d^2 ab.\\nDivide both sides by d^2 (d ≠ 0 since mn ≠ 0 in this discussion):\\nd^3(a^5 - b^5) = 16ab.\\nSince gcd(a, b) = 1, we have gcd(a^5 - b^5, a) = gcd(b^5, a) = 1; similarly gcd(a^5 - b^5, b) = 1. So any prime dividing a or b does not divide (a^5 - b^5).\\nFrom d^3(a^5 - b^5) = 16ab, note that any prime p dividing a must divide RHS ⇒ p | 16ab, but p | a, so p | 16 or p | b. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, p ∤ b, so p | 16. Thus prime factors of a are only 2. Same for b. So a and b are powers of 2 times possibly a sign: a = ±2^u, b = ±2^v where u, v ≥ 0.\\nWrite a = ε1 2^u, b = ε2 2^v with ε1, ε2 ∈ {1, -1}.\\nThen gcd(a, b) = 1 forces u = 0 or v = 0 (since if u, v > 0 they share factor 2). Without loss, assume u ≥ v. If v > 0, they share 2, contradiction, so v = 0. Then b = ±1, and a = ±2^u.\\nNow plug into d^3(a^5 - b^5) = 16ab.\\nWe have a^5 - b^5 = ε1 2^{5u} - ε2.\\nAlso 16ab = 16(ε1 2^u)(ε2) = 16 ε1 ε2 2^u.\\nSo equation: d^3(ε1 2^{5u} - ε2) = 16 ε1 ε2 2^u.\\nWe need integer d, u ≥ 0, ε1, ε2 = ±1.\\nWe also must reconstruct m, n = d a, d b giving integer pair.\\nConsider possible u.\\nFirst, note that |a| ≥ |b| ⇒ |m| = |d a| ≥ |d b| = |n|, but equation does not require ordering.\\nTreat cases for b = 1 and b = -1 separately.\\nCase 1: b = 1 (ε2 = 1).\\nThen equation becomes d^3(ε1 2^{5u} - 1) = 16 ε1 2^u.\\nSubcase 1.1: ε1 = 1 ⇒ a = 2^u.\\nThen d^3(2^{5u} - 1) = 16·2^u = 2^4·2^u = 2^{u+4}.\\nThus d^3 divides RHS, so d^3 is a power of 2, so d = 2^k. Left side factors as 2^{3k}(2^{5u}-1) = 2^{u+4}.\\nHence 2^{5u}-1 must be a power of 2 as well, say 2^t, and we have 3k + t = u + 4.\\nBut 2^{5u}-1 is odd; if it’s a power of 2, it must be 1. So 2^{5u} - 1 = 1 ⇒ 2^{5u} = 2 ⇒ 5u = 1 ⇒ no integer u. So no solutions in this subcase.\\nSubcase 1.2: ε1 = -1 ⇒ a = -2^u.\\nEquation: d^3(-2^{5u} - 1) = 16(-1)2^u = -16·2^u.\\nMultiply by -1: d^3(2^{5u} + 1) = 16·2^u = 2^{u+4}.\\nSo 2^{5u} + 1 is odd and must divide a power of 2, hence 2^{5u}+1 = 1 ⇒ 2^{5u} = 0, impossible. Thus no solutions.\\nCase 2: b = -1 (ε2 = -1).\\nThen equation: d^3(ε1 2^{5u} + 1) = 16 ε1 (-1) 2^u = -16 ε1 2^u.\\nSo d^3(ε1 2^{5u} + 1) = -16 ε1 2^u.\\nSubcase 2.1: ε1 = 1 ⇒ a = 2^u.\\nThen d^3(2^{5u} + 1) = -16·2^u = -2^{u+4}.\\nThat’s impossible since LHS is positive (d^3 ≥ 0, 2^{5u} + 1 > 0) unless d = 0, but that would force m = n = 0 which contradicts b = -1. So no solutions.\\nSubcase 2.2: ε1 = -1 ⇒ a = -2^u.\\nThen equation: d^3(-2^{5u} + 1) = -16(-1)2^u = 16·2^u = 2^{u+4}.\\nSo d^3(1 - 2^{5u}) = 2^{u+4}.\\nFor u ≥ 1, 1 - 2^{5u} is negative, LHS negative, RHS positive, impossible. So u = 0.\\nIf u = 0, a = -1, b = -1. Then a = b contradicts gcd(a, b) = 1? No, gcd(-1, -1) = 1, but then m = d a, n = d b with a = b gives m = n (same sign). Check equation n^5 - n^5 = 0, but RHS 16n^2 > 0 if n ≠ 0, so that forces n = 0, but then b = -1 contradicts n = d b.\\nHowever, let’s recompute carefully for u = 0:\\nIf u = 0, then a = ε1 2^0 = -1, b = ε2 = -1. But we initially assumed b = -1, so that’s consistent; a = -1. Then a^5 - b^5 = (-1)^5 - (-1)^5 = -1 + 1 = 0. Our earlier step d^3(a^5 - b^5) = 16ab would give 0 = 16·(-1)(-1) = 16, impossible. So our derived equation for this case must not allow u = 0 either. Indeed, plugging u = 0 into d^3(1 - 2^{5u}) = 2^{u+4} gives d^3(1 - 1) = 2^4 ⇒ 0 = 16 impossible. So no solutions.\\nTherefore the only nontrivial solutions are those with k integer, and we already found they yield (0,0) and (-2, 2). By symmetry, we might consider also (2, -2), but check it in the original equation:\\nFor (m, n) = (2, -2): m^5 - n^5 = 32 - (-32) = 64, RHS = 16·2·(-2) = -64, so 64 = -64 fails. So not a solution.\\nWe also check the possibility d = 0 that we excluded: if d = 0 then m = n = 0, handled already.\\nThus the full integer solution set is (0,0) and (-2,2).\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have polynomial x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48 with three positive roots p < q < r. By Vieta’s formulas:\\n1) p + q + r = a.\\n2) pq + pr + qr = b.\\n3) pqr = 48.\\nWe want to minimize S = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r = (qr + 2pr + 3pq)/(pqr) = (qr + 2pr + 3pq)/48.\\nSo minimizing S is equivalent to minimizing T = qr + 2pr + 3pq subject to p, q, r > 0, p < q < r, and pqr = 48.\\nWe treat this as a constrained optimization problem.\\nLet’s set r from the product constraint: r = 48/(pq). Then p < q < r becomes p < q < 48/(pq). We now write T as a function of p and q:\\nT(p, q) = qr + 2pr + 3pq = q·(48/(pq)) + 2p·(48/(pq)) + 3pq = 48/p + 96/q + 3pq.\\nSo S(p, q) = T/48 = 1/p + 2/q + (3pq)/48.\\nWe minimize S over p > 0, q > 0, with p < q and q < 48/(pq). The second inequality is q^2 p < 48.\\nTemporarily ignore the ordering constraints and solve the unconstrained minimization for p, q > 0.\\nCompute partial derivatives of S(p, q):\\n∂S/∂p = -1/p^2 + 3q/48 = -1/p^2 + q/16.\\nSet ∂S/∂p = 0 ⇒ q/16 = 1/p^2 ⇒ q = 16/p^2.\\n∂S/∂q = -2/q^2 + 3p/48 = -2/q^2 + p/16.\\nSet ∂S/∂q = 0 ⇒ p/16 = 2/q^2 ⇒ p = 32/q^2.\\nFrom q = 16/p^2 and p = 32/q^2 we solve simultaneously.\\nPlug q = 16/p^2 into p = 32/q^2:\\nq^2 = (16/p^2)^2 = 256/p^4.\\nThen p = 32 / (q^2) = 32 / (256/p^4) = 32·(p^4/256) = (32/256)p^4 = (1/8)p^4.\\nSo p = (1/8)p^4 ⇒ multiply both sides by 8: 8p = p^4 ⇒ p^4 - 8p = 0 ⇒ p(p^3 - 8) = 0.\\nSince p > 0, p ≠ 0, so p^3 - 8 = 0 ⇒ p^3 = 8 ⇒ p = 2.\\nThen q = 16/p^2 = 16/4 = 4.\\nNext r = 48/(pq) = 48/(2·4) = 48/8 = 6.\\nThese satisfy p < q < r (2 < 4 < 6) and positive roots constraint, and product pqr = 48 holds. So (p, q, r) = (2, 4, 6) is a critical point inside the allowed region.\\nWe should verify that this gives a minimum rather than a maximum or saddle. The function S is smooth and the domain p > 0, q > 0 with p < q < 48/(pq) is open in the interior. Compute second derivative test or observe convexity properties.\\nCompute second derivatives:\\nS(p, q) = 1/p + 2/q + (3pq)/48.\\n∂^2S/∂p^2 = 2/p^3 > 0 for p > 0.\\n∂^2S/∂q^2 = 4/q^3 > 0 for q > 0.\\nMixed partial ∂^2S/(∂p∂q) = ∂/∂q(q/16) = 1/16.\\nThus Hessian matrix at (p, q) is:\\nH = [[2/p^3, 1/16], [1/16, 4/q^3]].\\nAt p = 2, q = 4, this is:\\n2/p^3 = 2/8 = 1/4, 4/q^3 = 4/64 = 1/16.\\nSo H = [[1/4, 1/16], [1/16, 1/16]].\\nDeterminant = (1/4)(1/16) - (1/16)^2 = 1/64 - 1/256 = (4 - 1)/256 = 3/256 > 0, and top-left entry > 0, so H is positive definite. Thus S has a strict local minimum at (2, 4, 6).\\nWe also must check that the minimum over the whole feasible region cannot lie on the boundary.\\nThe boundaries are of three types: p → 0+, q → 0+, q → ∞, p → ∞, or q^2 p = 48, or p = q. Also r must remain positive.\\n- As p → 0+, 1/p → ∞, so S → ∞.\\n- As q → 0+, 2/q → ∞, so S → ∞.\\n- As p → ∞ or q → ∞, terms 1/p or 2/q may go to 0, but then r = 48/(pq) → 0, causing 3/r → ∞. Also the term (3pq)/48 directly shows S tends to infinity as pq → ∞.\\nThus no minimum at infinity; S → ∞ on such limits.\\n- On p = q, we would have p = q, but then r = 48/p^2 and order condition p < q fails since equality; however even if we temporarily allow p = q, we can compute S(p, p) = 1/p + 2/p + 3/(48/p^2) = 3/p + (3p^2)/48 = 3/p + p^2/16, which by calculus has minimum at p^3 = 24. That’s ≈ 2.884, but we require strict inequalities p < q, so this boundary is not in the domain. In any case, that value S is not less than the interior minimum we found; we can compare numerically: at p^3 = 24, p ≈ 2.884, S ≈ 3/2.884 + (2.884^2)/16 ≈ 1.040 + 0.520 ≈ 1.56, which is larger than the value at (2,4,6) we will compute.\\n- On boundary q^2 p = 48, i.e. r = q, which also violates q < r, so again not allowed. Approaching this boundary from inside, r → q+, so 3/r → 3/q, and S tends to 1/p + 2/q + 3/q = 1/p + 5/q, with p = 48/q^2. Substitute: 1/p = q^2/48, so S ≈ q^2/48 + 5/q evaluated near boundary. This function over q > 0 has a minimum where derivative 2q/48 - 5/q^2 = 0 ⇒ q^3 = 120, q ≈ 4.93, giving S ≈ 4.93^2/48 + 5/4.93 ≈ 0.506 + 1.014 ≈ 1.52, still bigger than the interior value at (2,4,6).\\nThus the unique global minimum in the allowed region occurs at (p, q, r) = (2,4,6).\\nCompute S at this triple:\\n1/p + 2/q + 3/r = 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/6 = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3/2.\\nSo the minimum possible value is 3/2.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: integer solutions (m, n) are (0,0) and (-2, 2).\\nProblem 2: the minimum possible value is 3/2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"(0,0),(-2,2)\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
