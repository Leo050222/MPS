Total intersections of 2 = 8+16=24.\\n\\nStep 4: Intersections of 3 events.\\nCompute |F_X ∩ F_Y ∩ F_Z| = 2^{6-|X ∪ Y ∪ Z|}.\\nWe find the unions:\\n- A,B,C: A∪B∪C = {1,3,4,5,6}, size 5 → 2.\\n- A,B,D: {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6 → 1.\\n- A,B,E: {1,2,3,4,6}, size 5 → 2.\\n- A,C,D: {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6 → 1.\\n- A,C,E: {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6 → 1.\\n- A,D,E: {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6 → 1.\\n- B,C,D: {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6 → 1.\\n- B,C,E: {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6 → 1.\\n- B,D,E: {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6 → 1.\\n- C,D,E: {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6 → 1.\\nSo we have two triples of size-5 union (A,B,C) and (A,B,E) each giving 2, and eight with size-6 union each giving 1.\\nSum = 2+1+2+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 12.\\n\\nStep 5: Intersections of 4 events.\\nCheck unions for 4-element combinations:\\n- A,B,C,D: union {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6 → 1.\\n- A,B,C,E: union {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6 → 1.\\n- A,B,D,E: union {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6 → 1.\\n- A,C,D,E: union {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6 → 1.\\n- B,C,D,E: union {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6 → 1.\\nSum (4-wise) = 5.\\n\\nStep 6: Intersection of all 5 events A,B,C,D,E.\\nUnion is {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6 → 2^{6-6}=1.\\n\\nStep 7: Inclusion–exclusion total for #subsets containing at least one bad subset.\\n|Union of F_X| = Sum singles - Sum pairs + Sum triples - Sum quadruples + Sum quintuple\\n= 44 - 24 + 12 - 5 + 1\\nCompute: 44 - 24 = 20, 20 + 12 = 32, 32 - 5 = 27, 27 + 1 = 28.\\nSo there are 28 subsets (including possibly empty) that contain some subset summing to 10.\\n\\nStep 8: Good subsets and non-empty.\\nTotal subsets: 64. Good subsets (no sub-subset sum 10) including empty = 64 - 28 = 36.\\nRemove empty set (since S must be non-empty): 36 - 1 = 35.\\nThus answer to Problem 1 is 35.\\n\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe seek nonnegative integer triples (a,b,c) satisfying (ab+1)(bc+1)(ca+1)=84.\\nFactor 84 = 2^2 * 3 * 7.\\nWrite x=ab+1, y=bc+1, z=ca+1 so xyz=84, with x,y,z positive integers. Also a,b,c ≥ 0 integers.\\nWe must find all (a,b,c) such that ab=(x-1), bc=(y-1), ca=(z-1) with xyz=84.\\n\\nWe analyze possible zeros first, then positive a,b,c.\\n\\nCase 1: Some of a,b,c is 0.\\nSubcase 1.1: Exactly one is zero.\\nAssume a=0, b>0, c>0.\\nThen ab=0→ab+1=1.\\nbc>0, ca=0.\\nCompute product: (ab+1)(bc+1)(ca+1) = 1 * (bc+1) * (1) = bc+1.\\nSo bc+1 must equal 84 → bc=83. Since 83 is prime, the positive factorization pairs (b,c) are (1,83) or (83,1).\\nThus with a=0 we get (0,1,83) and (0,83,1).\\nBy symmetry, if b=0, we require ac=83 → (1,0,83),(83,0,1). If c=0, we require ab=83 → (1,83,0),(83,1,0).\\nCheck they satisfy original equation: each has exactly one product term non-zero as intended, giving 84. So that is 6 solutions for exactly one zero.\\n\\nSubcase 1.2: Exactly two variables are zero.\\nSay a=0,b=0,c>0: then ab=0, bc=0, ca=0, so each factor is 1; product is 1≠84. Thus no solutions with exactly two zeros.\\n\\nSubcase 1.3: All three zero.\\nThen product is (0+1)^3=1^3=1≠84. So no solutions.\\n\\nSo all solutions with a zero give 6 triples.\\n\\nCase 2: a,b,c all positive.\\nThen x=ab+1≥2, y=bc+1≥2, z=ca+1≥2. So xyz=84 and each factor ≥2. We must find positive integers x,y,z≥2 with product 84 for which there exist positive integers a,b,c such that ab=x-1, bc=y-1, ca=z-1.\\n\\nFrom ab=x-1, bc=y-1, ca=z-1, multiply all three:\\n(ab)(bc)(ca) = (x-1)(y-1)(z-1).\\nLeft side = (abc)^2.\\nSo (abc)^2 = (x-1)(y-1)(z-1).\\nAlso xyz=84 is constrained.\\nBut instead of solving this system in full generality, we can reason via divisibility and symmetry.\\n\\nWe have ab = x-1, so x-1 must factor as product of two positive integers. Similarly for y-1,z-1. Also b divides both ab and bc, hence b divides gcd(ab,bc) = b*gcd(a,c), so this is automatically true, but we can relate these equations more directly.\\nFrom ab=x-1 and bc=y-1, we get:\\n(x-1)c = (ab)c = abc,\\n(y-1)a = (bc)a = abc,\\n(z-1)b = (ca)b = abc.\\nSo abc is common value:\\nabc = (x-1)c = (y-1)a = (z-1)b.\\nThus a,b,c relate x,y,z by:\\n(x-1)c = (y-1)a,\\n(y-1)a = (z-1)b,\\n(z-1)b = (x-1)c.\\nFrom (x-1)c = (y-1)a, we have a/c = (x-1)/(y-1).\\nSimilarly b/a = (y-1)/(z-1), c/b = (z-1)/(x-1).\\nMultiplying all three ratios gives 1 automatically, so this is consistent structurally. The trouble is more about enumerating finite possibilities of x,y,z.\\n\\nHowever, another approach is more direct: enumerate all factor triples (x,y,z) of 84 with x,y,z≥2, and for each examine whether there exist positive integers a,b,c satisfying ab=x-1, bc=y-1, ca=z-1.\\nGiven small size of 84, this enumeration is manageable by reasoning.\\n\\nObservation: ab,bc,ca all equal one less than a divisor of 84. So ab,bc,ca ∈ {1,2,3,6,7,11,13,20,27,41,83} etc? No, we must list d such that d+1|84. Actually ab = d where d+1 divides 84, so d ∈ {1,2,3,6,7,13,20,27,41,83} obtained from 84's divisors {2,3,4,7,8,14,21,28,42,84} minus 1.\\nThus each of ab,bc,ca must come from that set: D={1,2,3,6,7,13,20,27,41,83}.\\nAlso the three values ab,bc,ca must be consistent for some positive a,b,c.\\n\\nWe can use the relation:\\nabc is positive integer, and (abc)^2 = (ab)(bc)(ca) = (ab)(bc)(ca).\\nSo (abc)^2 = (ab)(bc)(ca) must be a perfect square. That is, the product (ab)(bc)(ca) must be a square.\\nSince ab,bc,ca belong to D, we need to choose three values (possibly equal) from D whose product is a perfect square. Among those triples we further need that there exist a,b,c with those pairwise products.\\nBut observe that (ab)(bc)(ca) = (abc)^2 is always a perfect square for any a,b,c; so the necessity just restates the identity. In reverse, if we choose any three positive integers u,v,w as ab,bc,ca, we are not guaranteed there exist a,b,c, but if they do exist then uvw is automatically a square. So a necessary condition is that uvw is a square. We can use this to eliminate impossible choices; then we still must check consistency.\\n\\nLet u=ab, v=bc, w=ca. Then uvw=(abc)^2 is a square; conversely, if we start from integers u,v,w whose product is a square and they pairwise share a structure enabling a,b,c to exist, we can solve.\\nWe have:\\nMultiply equations ab=u, bc=v, ca=w.\\nWe get (abc)^2 = uvw.\\nThen a^2 = (ab·ca)/bc = (u·w)/v, so we need (u·w)/v to be a perfect square integer. Similarly, b^2 = (u·v)/w and c^2 = (v·w)/u must be integers and squares. So we need u·w divisible by v, etc., with square quotients.\\n\\nBut we don't need full generality: we just explore possible x,y,z factor triples of 84.\\nNote x,y,z ∈ divisors of 84, ≥2. Set of positive divisors of 84: {1,2,3,4,6,7,12,14,21,28,42,84}. We exclude 1 because ab+1≥2, so x,y,z ∈ {2,3,4,6,7,12,14,21,28,42,84}.\\nFor each such x, ab=x-1 must be in D; that only allows x values where x-1 ∈ D.\\nFrom the list D and divisors of 84, we see x=2(1+1),3(2+1),4(3+1),7(6+1),8(7+1 but 8 not a divisor of 84),14(13+1),21(20+1),28(27+1),42(41+1),84(83+1). But note 8 is not a divisor of 84, so x∈{2,3,4,7,14,21,28,42,84}.\\nIntersect with divisors≥2 gives exactly these 9 values.\\nSo x,y,z each lie in this 9-element set and xyz=84.\\nNow we can enumerate triples (x,y,z) in that set with product 84.\\n\\nLet’s list all factor triples (in non-decreasing order) of 84:\\n1*1*84,\\n1*2*42,\\n1*3*28,\\n1*4*21,\\n1*6*14,\\n1*7*12,\\n1* (other pairs) etc,\\n2*2*21,\\n2*3*14,\\n2*6*7,\\n3*4*7,\\n3* (other pairs),\\n4* (other pairs).\\nBut we must have all three factors from allowed set S={2,3,4,7,14,21,28,42,84}.\\nSo we discard those containing 1 or 6 or 12.\\nCheck each triple:\\n- 2*2*21 =84, all in S → allowed.\\n- 2*3*14=84, all in S.\\n- 2*6*7 has 6 not in S → not allowed.\\n- 3*4*7=84, all in S.\\n- 3* (something else) maybe 3*7*4 already counted; 4* (other) but 4*21*1, etc involve 1.\\nAlso consider 2*42*1 bad; 3*28*1 bad; 4*21*1 bad; 7*12*1 bad.\\nAlso possibility 7*12*1 not allowed.\\nCheck 14*3*2 is perm of 2,3,14; 21*2*2 is perm of 2,2,21.\\n84*1*1 invalid. 28*3*1 invalid. 42*2*1 invalid.\\nSo the only unordered triples (x,y,z) up to permutation are:\\nT1: (2,2,21)\\nT2: (2,3,14)\\nT3: (3,4,7)\\n\\nNow for each triple, we must solve ab=x-1, bc=y-1, ca=z-1 for positive integers a,b,c.\\nWe must also include all permutations of (x,y,z), since (a,b,c) are ordered.\\n\\nWe proceed systematically. For a given (x,y,z) we set:\\n(1) ab = x-1\\n(2) bc = y-1\\n(3) ca = z-1\\nWe can determine constraints as earlier: a^2 = (ab·ca)/bc = (x-1)(z-1)/(y-1). Similarly b^2 = (x-1)(y-1)/(z-1), c^2 = (y-1)(z-1)/(x-1). These must be positive integers and perfect squares.\\nSo for each triple (x,y,z), compute these expressions.\\n\\nCompute for T1: (2,2,21).\\nHere x=2,y=2,z=21.\\nThen x-1=1, y-1=1, z-1=20.\\nCompute a^2 = (x-1)(z-1)/(y-1) = (1*20)/1 =20, not a perfect square. So no solution.\\nBut that's only for this ordering; we must consider permutations of (2,2,21).\\nThe multiset is {2,2,21}. Possible assignments to (x,y,z): (2,2,21), (2,21,2), (21,2,2).\\n- Case x=2,y=2,z=21 already gives a^2=20, reject.\\n- Case x=2,y=21,z=2 → x-1=1,y-1=20,z-1=1.\\n  a^2 = (x-1)(z-1)/(y-1) = (1*1)/20 = 1/20 not integer, reject.\\n- Case x=21,y=2,z=2 → x-1=20,y-1=1,z-1=1.\\n  a^2 = (x-1)(z-1)/(y-1) = (20*1)/1 =20 not square, reject.\\nSo T1 yields no positive solutions.\\n\\nCompute for T2: multiset {2,3,14}.\\nFirst ordering x=2,y=3,z=14.\\nThen x-1=1, y-1=2, z-1=13.\\nCompute a^2 = (x-1)(z-1)/(y-1) = (1*13)/2 = 13/2, reject.\\nNext ordering x=2,y=14,z=3.\\nThen x-1=1,y-1=13,z-1=2.\\n a^2 = (1*2)/13 = 2/13, reject.\\nNext x=3,y=2,z=14.\\n x-1=2,y-1=1,z-1=13.\\n a^2 = (2*13)/1 =26, reject.\\nNext x=3,y=14,z=2.\\n x-1=2,y-1=13,z-1=1.\\n a^2 = (2*1)/13 =2/13, reject.\\nNext x=14,y=2,z=3.\\n x-1=13,y-1=1,z-1=2.\\n a^2 = (13*2)/1=26, reject.\\nNext x=14,y=3,z=2.\\n x-1=13,y-1=2,z-1=1.\\n a^2=(13*1)/2=13/2, reject.\\nSo no permutations of T2 yield integer square a^2, thus no positive solutions.\\n\\nCompute for T3: multiset {3,4,7}.\\nWe consider all permutations.\\n1) x=3,y=4,z=7.\\nThen x-1=2,y-1=3,z-1=6.\\n a^2=(2*6)/3=12/3=4 → a=2.\\n b^2=(2*3)/6=6/6=1 → b=1.\\n c^2=(3*6)/2=18/2=9 → c=3.\\nSo (a,b,c)=(2,1,3) is a positive integer solution.\\nCheck: ab+1=2*1+1=3=x, bc+1=1*3+1=4=y, ca+1=3*2+1=7=z.
