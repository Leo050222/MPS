Expressing n as 3^a × 673^b × k (k coprime to 3, 673), we derive equations for φ(2019n) and φ(n²). Solving cases for a, b ≥ 0:\\n- Case a > 0, b = 0: Leads to n = 2016.\\n- Case a = 0, b > 0: Leads to n = 1346.\\n- Case a > 0, b > 0: Leads to n = 2019.\\nVerification confirms these satisfy φ(2019n) = φ(n²). No other solutions exist.\\n\\nProblem 2: Define b_n = a_n + 1. The recurrence simplifies to b_{n+1} = b_n² / b_{n-1}, showing {b_n} is geometric. With a₁ = 1 ⇒ b₁ = 2, and a₉ = 7 ⇒ b₉ = 8. Solving 2r⁸ = 8 gives r⁴ = 2. Thus, a₅ = 2r⁴ - 1 = 3.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1346,2016,2019\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
