Let $ f(x) = c $ for all $ x $.\\n\\nThen original equation becomes:\\n\\n$$\\nc = y c + c^3 \\\\quad \\\\text{for all } y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}.\\n$$\\n\\nThis must hold for all $ y $, so coefficient of $ y $ must be zero: $ c = 0 $.\\nThen we get $ c = 0 + c^3 \\\\Rightarrow c = c^3 \\\\Rightarrow c(c^2 - 1) = 0 $.\\nBut from $ c = yc + c^3 $, with $ c \\\\neq 0 $, then $ c = yc + c^3 \\\\Rightarrow c(1 - y - c^2) = 0 $ — not possible for all $ y $ unless $ c = 0 $.\\n\\nSo only possibility in constant case is $ c = 0 $.\\nCheck: $ f(x) = 0 $.\\nLeft: $ f(xf(y) + y^3) = f(0 + y^3) = 0 $.\\nRight: $ y f(x) + f(y)^3 = 0 + 0 = 0 $. OK.\\nSo $ f \\\\equiv 0 $ is a solution.\\n\\nNow suppose $ f(0) = 0 $.\\nFrom earlier, $ f(xf(0)) = f(0)^3 \\\\Rightarrow f(0) = 0 $, which is consistent.\\n\\nStep 2: Try $ x = 0 $.\\n\\nSet $ x = 0 $:\\n\\n$$\\nf(0 \\\\cdot f(y) + y^3) = y f(0) + f(y)^3 \\\\Rightarrow f(y^3) = f(y)^3.\\n$$\\n\\nSo we have:\\n\\n$$\\nf(y^3) = f(y)^3 \\\\quad \\\\text{for all } y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. \\\\tag{1}\\n$$\\n\\nStep 3: Suppose $ f $ is not identically zero. Then there exists some $ y_0 $ such that $ f(y_0) \\\\neq 0 $.\\n\\nLet us try to find $ f(1) $, or look for injectivity/surjectivity.\\n\\nTry $ y = 1 $:\\n\\n$$\\nf(xf(1) + 1) = f(x) + f(1)^3. \\\\tag{2}\\n$$\\n\\nLet $ a = f(1) $. Then:\\n\\n$$\\nf(a x + 1) = f(x) + a^3.\\n$$\\n\\nInteresting. This suggests a recursive relation.\\n\\nSuppose $ a = 0 $, i.e., $ f(1) = 0 $.\\nThen (2) becomes $ f(1) = f(x) + 0 \\\\Rightarrow f(1) = 0 $, but left side is $ f(1) = 0 $, right side is $ f(x) $? No:\\nWait: when $ y = 1 $, and $ f(1) = 0 $:\\n\\n$ f(x \\\\cdot 0 + 1^3) = 1 \\\\cdot f(x) + 0^3 \\\\Rightarrow f(1) = f(x) $.\\nBut $ f(1) = 0 $, so $ f(x) = 0 $ for all $ x $.\\nThus again $ f \\\\equiv 0 $.\\n\\nSo if $ f(1) = 0 $, then $ f \\\\equiv 0 $.\\n\\nTherefore, any non-zero solution must have $ f(1) \\\\neq 0 $, so $ a \\\\neq 0 $.\\n\\nSo assume $ a = f(1) \\\\neq 0 $.\\nThen:\\n\\n$$\\nf(a x + 1) = f(x) + a^3.\\n$$\\n\\nThis allows us to express $ f $ at linear transformations.\\n\\nCan we find more?\\n\\nRecall from (1): $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $.\\n\\nTry $ y = -1 $:\\n\\nLet $ b = f(-1) $.\\nFrom (1): $ f((-1)^3) = f(-1)^3 \\\\Rightarrow f(-1) = b^3 $, so $ b = b^3 \\\\Rightarrow b(b^2 - 1) = 0 $, so $ b \\\\in \\\\{0, 1, -1\\\\} $.\\n\\nNow go back to original equation.\\n\\nTry to see if $ f $ can be identity.\\nSuppose $ f(x) = x $. Check:\\nLeft: $ f(xf(y) + y^3) = f(xy + y^3) = xy + y^3 $.\\nRight: $ y f(x) + f(y)^3 = yx + y^3 $. Equal. So $ f(x) = x $ works.\\n\\nAlso $ f(x) = 0 $ works, as seen.\\n\\nAre there others?\\n\\nTry $ f(x) = -x $.\\nLeft: $ f(xf(y) + y^3) = f(-x y + y^3) = -(-x y + y^3) = x y - y^3 $.\\nRight: $ y f(x) + f(y)^3 = y(-x) + (-y)^3 = -x y - y^3 $.\\nNot equal unless $ y^3 = 0 $. So no.\\n\\nTry $ f(x) = x^k $? Probably not.\\n\\nBack to equation:\\n\\nWe have $ f(a x + 1) = f(x) + a^3 $, with $ a = f(1) \\\\neq 0 $.\\n\\nLet’s define a sequence.\\nLet $ x_0 = 0 $, $ x_1 = 1 $, etc., but better to iterate.\\n\\nSet $ x = 0 $ in this: $ f(a \\\\cdot 0 + 1) = f(0) + a^3 \\\\Rightarrow f(1) = 0 + a^3 \\\\Rightarrow a = a^3 $.\\nSince $ f(0) = 0 $.\\nSo $ a = a^3 \\\\Rightarrow a(a^2 - 1) = 0 $.\\nBut $ a \\\\neq 0 $, so $ a^2 = 1 \\\\Rightarrow a = \\\\pm 1 $.\\n\\nSo $ f(1) = 1 $ or $ f(1) = -1 $.\\n\\nCase A: $ f(1) = 1 $.\\nThen $ f(x \\\\cdot 1 + 1) = f(x) + 1^3 \\\\Rightarrow f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1 $.\\nSo $ f $ is additive with step 1: $ f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 $.\\nBy induction, $ f(n) = n $ for all integers $ n $, since $ f(0) = 0 $, $ f(1) = 1 $, etc.\\nAlso $ f(-1) = ? $\\nFrom earlier, $ f(-1) = b \\\\in \\\\{0,1,-1\\\\} $, and $ f(-1 + 1) = f(0) = 0 = f(-1) + 1 \\\\Rightarrow f(-1) = -1 $. So $ b = -1 $, which is allowed.\\nSo $ f(n) = n $ for all integers $ n $.\\n\\nNow, from $ f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 $, we can write $ f(x) = x + p(x) $ where $ p $ is periodic with period 1.\\nBut we also have other constraints.\\n\\nRecall $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $.\\nIf $ f(x) = x $, it works. Is it the only one?\\n\\nTry to prove $ f $ is odd or something.\\n\\nGo back to original equation:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x f(y) + y^3) = y f(x) + f(y)^3.\\n$$\\n\\nWe suspect $ f(x) = x $ is solution, and $ f = 0 $.\\nBut is $ f = 0 $ compatible with $ f(1) = 1 $? No. So in this branch $ f(1) = 1 $, $ f \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 $.\\n\\nNow, suppose we can show $ f $ is surjective or injective.\\n\\nTry to fix $ y $ and vary $ x $.\\nThe left side is $ f(\\\\text{something linear in } x) $, right side is linear in $ f(x) $.\\n\\nSuppose $ f(y) \\\\neq 0 $, then as $ x $ varies, $ x f(y) + y^3 $ covers all real numbers (since $ f(y) \\\\neq 0 $), so left side covers all values of $ f $, so $ f $ is defined everywhere, but more: the argument covers $ \\\\mathbb{R} $, so left side is $ f(\\\\mathbb{R}) $, so image of $ f $ includes all values $ y f(x) + f(y)^3 $ for fixed $ y $, varying $ x $.\\nBut $ f(x) $ could be bounded or not.\\n\\nBut from $ f(x+1) = f(x)+1 $, $ f $ is unbounded above and below, so $ f(x) \\\\to \\\\infty $ as $ x \\\\to \\\\infty $, etc.\\n\\nNow, let’s use $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $.\\n\\nLet $ z = y^3 $, then $ f(z) = f(z^{1/3})^3 $.\\n\\nNow, try $ y = 2 $. We know $ f(2) = f(1+1) = f(1)+1 = 2 $.\\nSimilarly $ f(8) = f(2^3) = f(2)^3 = 8 $.\\nAlso $ f(8) = f(7+1) = f(7)+1 = \\\\cdots = f(0) + 8 = 8 $. Consistent.\\n\\nIn fact, for all integers $ n $, $ f(n) = n $.\\n\\nNow, what about rationals?\\n\\nLet $ r = p/q $. Not clear.\\n\\nAssume $ f $ is additive? Not necessarily.\\n\\nAnother idea: set $ x = 1 $ in original equation:\\n\\n$$\\nf(f(y) + y^3) = y f(1) + f(y)^3 = y a + f(y)^3.\\n$$\\nWith $ a = 1 $ in this case, so:\\n\\n$$\\nf(f(y) + y^3) = y + f(y)^3. \\\\tag{3}\\n$$\\n\\nBut from earlier, $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $, so right side is $ y + f(y^3) $.\\n\\nNot obvious.\\n\\nNote that if $ f(y) + y^3 = y^3 + f(y) $, and if we had $ f(u + v) = f(u) + f(v) $, but we don't.\\n\\nAnother approach: suppose we let $ u = x f(y) + y^3 $, then $ f(u) = y f(x) + f(y)^3 $.\\n\\nBut hard.\\n\\nTry to show $ f $ is injective.\\n\\nSuppose $ f(a) = f(b) $. Can we show $ a = b $?\\n\\nNot obvious.\\n\\nSuppose $ f(y) = 0 $ for some $ y $.\\nThen original equation:\\n\\n$ f(x \\\\cdot 0 + y^3) = y f(x) + 0^3 \\\\Rightarrow f(y^3) = y f(x) $.\\n\\nBut $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 = 0 $, so $ 0 = y f(x) $ for all $ x $.\\nSo either $ y = 0 $ or $ f(x) = 0 $ for all $ x $.\\nBut we are in case $ f \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 $, so $ y = 0 $.\\nThus $ f(y) = 0 $ implies $ y = 0 $.\\nSo $ f(y) = 0 $ iff $ y = 0 $.\\n\\nGood: $ f $ has only root at 0.\\n\\nNow, back to $ f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 $.\\nThis implies $ f(x) = x + p(x) $ where $ p $ is periodic with period 1.\\n\\nNow plug into $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $.\\n\\n$ f(y^3) = y^3 + p(y^3) $\\n$ f(y)^3 = (y + p(y))^3 = y^3 + 3y^2 p(y) + 3y p(y)^2 + p(y)^3 $\\nSet equal:\\n\\n$ y^3 + p(y^3) = y^3 + 3y^2 p(y) + 3y p(y)^2 + p(y)^3 $\\nSo\\n\\n$ p(y^3) = 3y^2 p(y) + 3y p(y)^2 + p(y)^3 $\\n\\nSince $ p $ is periodic with period 1, it is bounded if continuous, but we don’t have continuity.\\nBut the right side, for large $ y $, if $ p(y) \\\\neq 0 $, grows like $ y^2 $, while left side is bounded (if $ p $ is bounded), contradiction unless $ p(y) = 0 $.\\nBut $ p $ may not be bounded.\\nHowever, $ p(y) = f(y) - y $, and $ f $ satisfies $ f(x+1) = f(x)+1 $, so $ p(x+1) = f(x+1) - (x+1) = f(x)+1 - x -1 = f(x) - x = p(x) $, so periodic.\\nBut without continuity, $ p $ could be wild.\\n\\nBut the equation $ p(y^3) = 3y^2 p(y) + 3y p(y)^2 + p(y)^3 $ must hold for all $ y $.\\nFix $ y $, then for $ y + n $, $ p(y+n) = p(y) $, same value.\\nBut $ p((y+n)^3) = p(y^3 + 3y^2 n + 3y n^2 + n^3) $.\\nAs $ n $ varies over integers, $ (y+n)^3 $ mod 1 depends on fractional part, but the argument goes to infinity.\\nThe left side $ p((y+n)^3) $ is bounded if we assume $ p $ is bounded, but right side: $ 3(y+n)^2 p(y+n) + \\\\cdots = 3(y+n)^2 p(y) + \\\\cdots $ which grows like $ n^2 $ if $ p(y) \\\\neq 0 $.\\nSo unless $ p(y) = 0 $, right side unbounded as $ n \\\\to \\\\infty $, but left side is $ p(\\\\text{large number}) $, which if $ p $ is periodic, takes values in a bounded set (since periodic functions on $ \\\\mathbb{R} $ with period 1 are determined by values on [0,1], but without continuity, they can be unbounded! For example, define $ p $ arbitrarily on [0,1), then extend periodically. It could be unbounded if we allow pathological functions.\\nBut perhaps in functional equations, we assume reasonable functions, or we need to consider all functions.\\n\\nBut let's see if we can avoid pathology.\\n\\nWe have another case: $ f(1) = -1 $.\\n\\nEarlier, $ a = f(1) = \\\\pm 1 $.\\nWe did $ a = 1 $. Now $ a = -1 $.\\n\\nSo $ f(1) = -1 $.\\nThen from $ f(a x + 1) = f(x) + a^3 $, $ a = -1 $, $ a^3 = -1 $, so:\\n\\n$ f(-x + 1) = f(x) - 1 $.\\n\\nAlso, $ f(0) = 0 $.\\nSet $ x = 0 $: $ f(1) = f(0) - 1 = -1 $, yes.\\nSet $ x = 1 $: $ f(-1 + 1) = f(0) = 0 = f(1) - 1 = -1 -1 = -2 $? Contradiction! $ 0 = -2 $?\\nNo:\\n$ f(-x + 1) = f(x) - 1 $.\\nSet $ x = 1 $: $ f(-1 + 1) = f(0) = 0 $, and $ f(1) - 1 = -1 -1 = -2 $. So $ 0 = -2 $. Contradiction.\\n\\nThus $ f(1) = -1 $ is impossible.\\n\\nTherefore, only possibilities are $ f \\\\equiv 0 $ or $ f(1) = 1 $ and $ f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 $.\\n\\nNow, in the latter case, we have $ f(n) = n $ for all integers $ n $.\\n\\nNow, let’s try to find $ f $ at other points.\\n\\nUse the original equation with specific values.\\n\\nSet $ x = 1 $:\\n\\n$ f(f(y) + y^3) = y f(1) + f(y)^3 = y \\\\cdot 1 + f(y)^3 = y + f(y)^3 $.\\n\\nBut $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $, so:\\n\\n$ f(f(y) + y^3) = y + f(y^3) $.\\n\\nNow, if we assume $ f $ is additive, then $ f(f(y) + y^3) = f(f(y)) + f(y^3) $, so $ f(f(y)) + f(y^3) = y + f(y^3) \\\\Rightarrow f(f(y)) = y $.\\nSo $ f $ is an involution.\\nBut we don’t know additivity.\\n\\nSuppose that $ f $ is bijective.\\nWe know $ f $ is not zero, and $ f(y) = 0 $ iff $ y = 0 $.\\nFrom $ f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 $, as $ x \\\\to \\\\infty $, $ f(x) \\\\to \\\\infty $, similarly to $ -\\\\infty $, so range is unbounded, but not necessarily surjective.\\n\\nTry to show $ f $ is surjective.\\nFor any $ c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} $, is there $ x $ such that $ f(x) = c $?\\nFrom $ f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 $, the range is invariant under translation by 1, so if it misses a point, it misses a whole residue class, but since it goes to ±∞, and connected? Not necessarily.\\n\\nAssume $ f(f(y)) = y $ from above, but we need justification.\\n\\nAnother idea: set $ y = 1 $ in original:\\nWe already did: $ f(x f(1) + 1) = 1 \\\\cdot f(x) + f(1)^3 \\\\Rightarrow f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1 $, since $ f(1)=1 $.\\n\\nNow, let me try $ y = 2 $.\\nf(2) = f(1+1) = f(1)+1 = 2.\\nf(8) = f(2^3) = f(2)^3 = 8.\\nAlso f(8) = f(7+1) = ... = 8, good.\\n\\nNow, original equation with y=2:\\n\\nf(x f(2) + 8) = 2 f(x) + f(2)^3 => f(2x + 8) = 2 f(x) + 8.\\n\\nBut f(2x + 8) = f(2x) + 8, because f(z+8) = f(z) + 8, since f(w+1)=f(w)+1, so by induction f(w+k)=f(w)+k for integer k.\\nSo f(2x + 8) = f(2x) + 8.\\nThus:\\n\\nf(2x) + 8 = 2 f(x) + 8 => f(2x) = 2 f(x).\\n\\nOh! So f(2x) = 2 f(x) for all x.\\n\\nSimilarly, try y=3.\\nf(3) = 3, f(27) = f(3)^3 = 27.\\nEquation with y=3:\\nf(x f(3) + 27) = 3 f(x) + f(3)^3 => f(3x + 27) = 3 f(x) + 27.\\nBut f(3x + 27) = f(3x) + 27, so f(3x) + 27 = 3 f(x) + 27 => f(3x) = 3 f(x).\\n\\nSimilarly, for any integer n, f(n x) = n f(x)?\\nWe have for n=2,3.\\nWhat about n=1? Trivial.\\nn=0? f(0*x)=f(0)=0, 0*f(x)=0, ok.\\nn negative?\\nFirst, f(-x): set x=0 in f(x+1)=f(x)+1: f(1)=f(0)+1=1.\\nf(0)=f(-1+1)=f(-1)+1 => 0 = f(-1) + 1 => f(-1) = -1.\\nSimilarly, f(-n) = -n for integers.\\nNow, set y=-1 in original equation.\\nf(-1) = -1, f((-1)^3)=f(-1)= -1, and f(-1)^3 = (-1)^3 = -1, so f(y^3)=f(y)^3 holds.\\nNow, equation:\\nf(x f(-1) + (-1)^3) = (-1) f(x) + f(-1)^3 => f(x*(-1) -1) = -f(x) + (-1) => f(-x -1) = -f(x) -1.\\nBut f(-x -1) = f( -(x+1) ).\\nAlso, from f(z+1)=f(z)+1, f(-x-1) = f(-x) -1.\\nSo f(-x) -1 = -f(x) -1 => f(-x) = -f(x).\\nSo f is odd!\\nGreat.\\nSo f is odd, f(-x) = -f(x).\\nNow, for negative integers, say y = -2.\\nf(-2) = -2, f(-8) = f((-2)^3) = f(-2)^3 = (-2)^3 = -8.\\nEquation: f(x f(-2) + (-8)) = (-2) f(x) + f(-2)^3 => f(-2x -8) = -2 f(x) + (-8) = -2f(x) -8.\\nLeft: f(-2x -8) = - f(2x + 8) , since odd.\\nf(2x+8) = f(2x) + 8, as before.\\nSo - (f(2x) + 8) = -f(2x) -8.\\nSet equal: -f(2x) -8 = -2f(x) -8 => f(2x) = 2f(x), same as before.\\nSimilarly for any integer k, f(k x) = k f(x)?\\nWe have for k=2,3.\\nTry k=n, positive integer.\\nAssume f(n) = n.\\nThen f(x f(n) + n^3) = n f(x) + f(n)^3 => f(n x + n^3) = n f(x) + n^3.\\nBut f(n x + n^3) = f(n x) + n^3, since adding integer.\\nSo f(n x) + n^3 = n f(x) + n^3 => f(n x) = n f(x).\\nYes! So for all positive integers n, and all real x, f(n x) = n f(x).\\nFor n=0, trivial.\\nFor negative n, say n = -m, m>0.\\nf(n x) = f(-m x) = - f(m x) = - m f(x) = n f(x).\\nSo for all integers n, f(n x) = n f(x).\\nMoreover, f(q) = q for all rational q? Let q = a/b, a,b integers, b≠0.\\nThen f(a) = a, and f(a) = f(b * (a/b)) = b f(a/b), so a = b f(a/b) => f(a/b) = a/b.\\nSo f(r) = r for all rational r.\\nNow, recall that f(y^3) = f(y)^3.\\nSuppose y is such that y^3 is rational, but y irrational, e.g., y = 2^{1/3}, then y^3 = 2, f(y^3) = f(2) = 2.\\nf(y)^3 = f(y)^3.\\nSo f(y)^3 = 2.\\nBut f(y) is some real number whose cube is 2, so f(y) = 2^{1/3} = y.\\nIs that right? f(y)^3 = 2, so f(y) = 2^{1/3}, since real numbers, and cube root is unique.\\nBut y = 2^{1/3}, so f(y) = y.\\nSimilarly, for any real y, let z = y^3, then f(z) = f(y)^3.\\nBut z is real, f(z) is determined.\\nBut we want f(y).\\nNote that for any real w, w = (w^{1/3})^3, so let y = w^{1/3}, then f(w) = f(y^3) = f(y)^3.\\nBut y = w^{1/3}, so f(w) = [f(w^{1/3})]^3.\\nBut this relates f at w and at w^{1/3}.\\nBut we already know that if w is rational, f(w)=w.\\nNow, suppose we want f(y) for arbitrary y.\\nFrom earlier, we have f(x+1) = f(x) + 1, and f(q x) = q f(x) for rational q.\\nIn particular, f is linear over rationals? That is, additive and homogeneous for rational scalars.\\nWe have f(q x) = q f(x) for rational q.\\nNow, is f additive? f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)?\\nNot yet.\\nBut we have f(n x) = n f(x) for integer n, and f(x+1) = f(x)+1, but not general additivity.\\nSuppose we can show f is additive.\\nThen since f(q) = q for rational q, and additive, then f is linear over Q, so f(x) = c x, but f(1) = 1, so c=1, f(x)=x.\\nBut is it additive?\\nLet me try to prove f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y).\\nWe know f(x+1) = f(x) + 1, and f(2x) = 2f(x), etc.\\nUse the original equation.\\nSet x=1 in original:\\nf(f(y) + y^3) = y + f(y)^3.\\nBut f(y^3) = f(y)^3, so right side is y + f(y^3).\\nNow, if I assume that f is additive, then left side f(f(y) + y^3) = f(f(y)) + f(y^3), so f(f(y)) + f(y^3) = y + f(y^3) => f(f(y)) = y.\\nSo f is involution.\\nBut without additivity.\\nNote that f(f(y) + y^3) = y + f(y^3).\\nNow, let me denote g(y) = f(y) + y^3.\\nThen f(g(y)) = y + f(y^3).\\nBut f(y^3) = f(y)^3.\\nNot helpful.\\nSince f(r) = r for all rational r, and f is odd, and f(q x) = q f(x) for rational q.\\nNow, for any real x, and rational r, f(x + r) = ?\\nWe know f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1, and by induction f(x + n) = f(x) + n for integer n.\\nNow, f(x + r) for rational r.\\nLet r = p/q.\\nNote that f(x + r) - f(x) might not be constant.\\nBut let me compute f at x + r.\\nConsider that the function h(x) = f(x) - x.\\nThen h is periodic with period 1, because f(x+1) = f(x) + 1, so h(x+1) = f(x+1) - (x+1) = f(x) + 1 - x - 1 = f(x) - x = h(x).\\nAlso, f(q x) = q f(x) for rational q.\\nSo h(q x) = f(q x) - q x = q f(x) - q x = q (f(x) - x) = q h(x).\\nSo h(q x) = q h(x) for all rational q, and all real x.\\nNow, h is periodic with period 1.\\nFix x, then for any rational q, h(q x) = q h(x).\\nBut h is periodic, so |h(z)| ≤ M for some M if h is bounded, but not necessarily.\\nSuppose h(x) ≠ 0 for some x.\\nThen h(q x) = q h(x), so as q → ∞, |h(q x)| → ∞.\\nBut q x mod 1: as q varies over integers, q x mod 1 is dense in [0,1) if x irrational, or periodic if rational.\\nBut h(q x) = h( {q x} ) where { } is fractional part, since periodic.\\nAnd |h( {q x} )| ≤ sup_{t∈[0,1)} |h(t)|, but this sup might be infinite if h is unbounded.\\nHowever, for fixed x, as q runs through integers, {q x} is dense in [0,1) if x irrational, so h(q x) = h({q x}) takes values dense in the range of h on [0,1), but h(q x) = q h(x), which goes to ±∞ as q → ±∞, so unless h(x) = 0, h(q x) is unbounded, but h({q x}) is bounded only if h is bounded on [0,1), but if h is unbounded on [0,1), it could be.\\nBut h(q x) = q h(x), and h(q x) = h({q x}), so |h({q x})| = |q| |h(x)|.\\nAs q → ∞, |q| |h(x)| → ∞, so |h({q x})| → ∞.\\nBut {q x} ∈ [0,1), so h is unbounded on [0,1).\\nBut now, for different x, similar thing.\\nBut now, recall that f(y^3) = f(y)^3.\\nSo h(y^3) + y^3 = f(y^3) = f(y)^3 = (h(y) + y)^3 = h(y)^3 + 3h(y)^2 y + 3h(y) y^2 + y^3.\\nSo h(y^3) = h(y)^3 + 3h(y)^2 y + 3h(y) y^2.\\nNow, h(y^3) = h( {y^3} ) since periodic with period 1.\\nRight side: h(y)^3 + 3y h(y)^2 + 3y^2 h(y).\\nNow, |h(y^3)| = |h({y^3})| ≤ K for some K? Not necessarily, but it's a fixed number for each y, but we need uniform bound.\\nSuppose that for some y, h(y) ≠ 0.\\nThen the right side has terms with h(y), and for large |y|, if |h(y)| is not small, it might grow.\\nBut h(y) = h({y}), so |h(y)| is bounded by the supremum of |h| on [0,1), but as we saw, if h is not identically zero, it must be unbounded on [0,1), because otherwise for any x with h(x)≠0, h(q x) = q h(x) → ∞, but h(q x) = h({q x}) bounded, contradiction.\\nSo if h is not identically zero, then h is unbounded on [0,1).\\nBut now, take y such that |h(y)| is very large.\\nBut y is related.\\nSet y = n, integer. Then h(n) = f(n) - n = n - n = 0.\\nSo at integers, h=0.\\nNow, take y near an integer.\\nBut let's take y such that {y} is where |h| is large.\\nSuppose we take a sequence y_k such that |h(y_k)| → ∞.\\nThen from h(y^3) = h(y)^3 + 3y h(y)^2 + 3y^2 h(y).\\nLeft side |h(y^3)| = |h({y^3})|, which is some value depending on the fractional part.\\nRight side, if |h(y)| is large, and y is fixed, then right side is approximately h(y)^3 if |h(y)| >> |y|, but y can also be large.\\nSuppose we fix y, but we can choose y large.\\nLet y be large, and suppose that at y, |h(y)| is large.\\nBut h(y) = h({y}), so it only depends on the fractional part of y.\\nSo for y with the same fractional part, h(y) is the same.\\nLet α ∈ [0,1), and let h(α) = c, some constant for that α.\\nThen for any real y with {y} = α, h(y) = c.\\nNow, y = n + α for integer n.\\nNow, y^3 = (n + α)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3.\\nSo {y^3} = {3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3} since n^3 integer.\\nAs n → ∞, this fractional part depends on α.\\nNow, h(y^3) = h({y^3}) = h( {3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3} ).\\nRight side: h(y)^3 + 3y h(y)^2 + 3y^2 h(y) = c^3 + 3(n+α) c^2 + 3(n+α)^2 c.\\n= c^3 + 3c^2 n + 3c^2 α + 3c (n^2 + 2nα + α^2) = c^3 + 3c^2 α + 3c α^2 + 3c^2 n + 6c α n + 3c n^2.\\n= 3c n^2 + (3c^2 + 6c α) n + (c^3 + 3c^2 α + 3c α^2)\\nThis is a quadratic in n, and as n → ∞, if c ≠ 0, this grows like 3c n^2.\\nLeft side h({y^3}) is bounded if h is bounded on [0,1), but we know that if c ≠ 0, h must be unbounded, but for this fixed α, h is evaluated at different points {y^3} as n varies.\\n{y^3} = {3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3}.\\nIf α is irrational, this sequence is dense in [0,1) or has some distribution.\\nBut h({y^3}) is h applied to this sequence.\\nIf h is bounded on [0,1), then left side bounded, right side → ±∞ as n→∞ if c≠0, contradiction.\\nBut earlier we said that if h is not identically zero, it must be unbounded on [0,1), so for this α, c=h(α)≠0, but h itself may be unbounded, so h({y^3}) could be large.\\nHowever, for the equality to hold for all n, we need that for each n, h( {3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3} ) = 3c n^2 + lower terms.\\nBut the left side, as n varies, {3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3} is a sequence in [0,1), and h is a fixed function, so h of that sequence is some sequence of reals.\\nThe right side grows quadratically in n.\\nBut the argument of h on left is in [0,1), so if h is bounded on [0,1), contradiction.\\nBut if h is unbounded, it could grow, but can it grow quadratically?\\nThe issue is that the argument {3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3} may not hit the points where h is large in a way that matches the quadratic growth.\\nIn particular, for h to satisfy h(z_n) = quadratic in n, with z_n in [0,1), but z_n is determined by α and n, and for fixed α, z_n is a specific sequence.\\nUnless for that α, the sequence z_n avoids the bad sets, but generally, for h to be defined such that at those specific points it equals a quadratic, it might be possible, but we also have other constraints.\\nMoreover, we have that for every y, this must hold.\\nBut suppose that h is not identically zero, so there is some α with c = h(α) ≠ 0.\\nThen for y = n + α, we have the equation:\\nh( { (n+α)^3 } ) = 3c n^2 + d n + e for some constants d,e depending on c,α.\\nAs n → ∞, the right side → ±∞ depending on sign of c.\\nLeft side is h applied to a sequence in [0,1).\\nIf h is bounded on [0,1), contradiction.\\nSo h must be unbounded on [0,1).\\nBut even if unbounded, the values h(z_n) must grow exactly like 3c n^2.\\nBut z_n = {3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3}.\\nThis sequence, for fixed α irrational, is dense in [0,1) if the coefficients are such, but actually, 3n^2 α mod 1, if α irrational, is dense in [0,1) because n^2 α mod 1 is dense for irrational α.\\nYes, it's known that {n^2 α} is dense in [0,1) if α irrational.\\nHere it's {3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3}, which is similar, still dense if α irrational.\\nSo z_n is dense in [0,1).\\nNow, h is a function on [0,1), and h(z_n) must be asymptotic to 3c n^2.\\nBut n is related to z_n; specifically, for large n, z_n ≈ {3n^2 α}, so n ≈ sqrt( z_n / (3α) ) roughly, but it's messy.\\nThe point is that h(z_n) grows like n^2, while z_n is in [0,1), so as n increases, z_n jumps around densely in [0,1), and h at those points must increase without bound.\\nBut for the function h to be well-defined, and since the sequence is dense, h must be unbounded, but moreover, along this sequence, it must grow quadratically with n.\\nBut n is not a continuous parameter; for each n, we have a point.\\nNow, the problem is that for different α, we have different sequences.\\nMoreover, we also have the condition that f(q x) = q f(x) for rational q, which gives h(q x) = q h(x).\\nNow, suppose we take x such that {x} = β, then h(x) = h(β).\\nThen for rational q, h(q x) = q h(x) = q h(β).\\nBut q x has fractional part {q x} = {q β}, since q x = q (n + β) = q n + q β, so {q x} = {q β}.\\nThus h(q x) = h({q x}) = h({q β}).\\nSo we have h({q β}) = q h(β) for all rational q and all β.\\nNow, fix β, then for each rational q, h({q β}) = q h(β).\\nNow, {q β} is in [0,1), and as q varies, this is a set of points.\\nIf β is irrational, {q β} for rational q? q is rational, β fixed.\\nFor example, q = m/n, but q is rational, so let q = a/b in lowest terms.\\nBut as q runs over rationals, {q β} = fractional part of (a/b) β.\\nThis set is dense in [0,1) if β is irrational, I think, but not sure.\\nFor instance, fix β irrational, q rational.\\nLet q = k, integer, then {k β} is dense if β irrational.\\nBut q can be fractions.\\nActually, the set { q β | q \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q} } is dense in \\\\mathbb{R} if β \\\\neq 0, since \\\\mathbb{Q} is dense.\\nMore carefully: the set { r β | r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q} } = β \\\\mathbb{Q}, which is dense in \\\\mathbb{R} if β \\\\neq 0.\\nTherefore, { r β | r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q} } is dense in [0,1).\\nNow, for each such r, h({r β}) = r h(β).\\nNow, {r β} is dense in [0,1), and h at these points is r h(β).\\nAs r varies over rationals, r h(β) takes all rational multiples of h(β), so if h(β) \\\\neq 0, this set is dense in \\\\mathbb{R}.\\nBut h is a function, so on a dense set, h takes values dense in \\\\mathbb{R}, so h is unbounded, which we knew.\\nBut now, for h to be defined, it's ok, but in our earlier equation for the cubic, we have a conflict.\\nSpecifically, for a fixed β with h(β) = c \\\\neq 0, then for each rational r, at point z_r = {r β}, h(z_r) = r c.\\nNow, consider y = n + β for integer n.\\nThen as before, h(y^3) = h( {(n+β)^3} ) = h( {n^3 + 3n^2 β + 3n β^2 + β^3} ) = h( {3n^2 β + 3n β^2 + β^3} )\\nAnd this must equal 3c n^2 + (3c^2 + 6c β) n + (c^3 + 3c^2 β + 3c β^2)\\nNow, the argument is w_n = {3n^2 β + 3n β^2 + β^3}\\nAnd h(w_n) = that quadratic expression.\\nBut w_n is in [0,1), and for large n, it's close to {3n^2 β} if β fixed.\\nNow, is w_n in the set { r β | r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q} }? Not necessarily.\\nBut h is defined everywhere, so it's ok, but the value must match.\\nHowever, the key point is that the right side grows like 3c n^2, while w_n is between 0 and 1, so as n increases, w_n moves around in [0,1), and h(w_n) must grow quadratically.\\nBut since w_n is dense in [0,1) for irrational β, and h must be very large at some points.\\nBut there is no contradiction yet, because h can be large.\\nHowever, we also have that for the points z_r = {r β}, h(z_r) = r c, which for large |r| is large, but r is rational, not related to n.\\nTo get a contradiction, suppose that for large n, w_n is close to some value, but h(w_n) is large, but if h were continuous, it would be impossible, but it's not.\\nPerhaps there is a solution, but likely in functional equations, we expect nice solutions.\\nMaybe the only solutions are f(x)=0 and f(x)=x.\\nLet me check if f(x)=x works: left side f(x f(y) + y^3) = f(x y + y^3) = x y + y^3.\\nRight side y f(x) + f(y)^3 = y x + y^3. Equal. Good.\\nf(x)=0: f(anything)=0, right side y*0 + 0=0. Good.\\nNow, are there others?\\nSuppose f is defined as f(x) = x for all x, or f(x)=0.\\nBut is there a pathological solution?\\nPerhaps not, because of the growth.\\nAssume that f is continuous. Then from f(x+1)=f(x)+1, and f(0)=0, f(1)=1, etc., and f(q)=q for rational q, so by continuity, f(x)=x for all x.\\nSimilarly, if measurable, etc.\\nBut the problem asks for all functions, so possibly pathological ones.\\nHowever, in the context, likely only these two.\\nMoreover, in the beginning, when f(0)≠0, we got only constant, which forced f=0.\\nWhen f(0)=0, we have f(y^3)=f(y)^3, and if f(1)=1, then f(x+1)=f(x)+1, and f(nx)=n f(x) for integer n, and f(r)=r for rational r.\\nNow, suppose there is another solution.\\nBut let's try to plug in y such that y^3 = x, but perhaps not.\\nSet x=0 in original: we did, f(y^3) = f(y)^3.\\nSet y=1: f(x+1) = f(x) +1.\\nNow, let me try to compute f at some point.\\nSuppose that f is not the identity.\\nFor example, suppose that for some x, f(x) ≠ x.\\nBut f(x) - x = h(x) = h({x}), periodic.\\nNow, from f(y^3) = f(y)^3, with y= x^{1/3}, f(x) = f(y)^3.\\nBut f(y) = f( {y} ) + floor(y), since f(z+1)=f(z)+1, so f(y) = f({y}) + n if y = n + {y}.\\nBut f({y}) = h({y}) + {y}, since f(z) = h(z) + z for z in [0,1).\\nSo f(y) = [h(α) + α] + n, where α = {y}, n = floor(y).\\nThen f(y)^3 = [h(α) + α + n]^3.\\nBut f(x) = f(y^3) = f( (n+α)^3 ) = f( n^3 + 3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3 ) = f(3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3) + n^3, because adding integer n^3.\\nAnd f(3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3) = h( {3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3} ) + {3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3}\\nSo overall, f(x) = h(w_n) + w_n + n^3, where w_n = {3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3}\\nOn the other hand, f(y)^3 = (h(α) + α + n)^3\\nSo we have:\\nh(w_n) + w_n + n^3 = (h(α) + α + n)^3\\nExpand right side: n^3 + 3n^2 (h(α) + α) + 3n (h(α) + α)^2 + (h(α) + α)^3\\nSo\\nh(w_n) + w_n = 3n^2 (h(α) + α) + 3n (h(α) + α)^2 + (h(α) + α)^3\\nLeft side is bounded if h is bounded, right side ~ 3n^2 (h(α) + α), so unless h(α) + α = 0, it grows, contradiction if h bounded.\\nBut if h unbounded, still, for this to hold for all n, with w_n depending on n, it's very restrictive.\\nIn particular, if we assume that h is bounded, then we must have h(α) + α = 0 for all α, but h(α) + α = f(α) for α in [0,1), and f(α) = α only if h(α)=0, but h(α) + α = 0 implies f(α) = 0, but for α=0.5, f(0.5) should be 0.5 if identity, but here 0, contradiction unless α=0.\\nBut at α=0, f(0)=0, good, but for other α, not.\\nSo if h bounded, then right side grows unless the coefficient is zero, so 3n^2 (h(α) + α) must be bounded, so h(α) + α = 0 for all α.\\nBut then f(α) = 0 for all α in [0,1), but f(1) = f(0+1) = f(0) +1 =1, but 1 not in [0,1), f(1) =1, but for α->1-, f(α)->0, not 1, discontinuity, but also f(0.5) =0, but earlier f(2*0.5) = f(1) =1, and 2 f(0.5) =2*0=0, not equal, contradiction to f(2x)=2f(x).\\nIndeed, f(1) =1, 2f(0.5) =2*0=0 ≠1.\\nSo contradiction.\\nTherefore, h cannot be bounded, so must be unbounded.\\nBut then for each α, with c = h(α), we have the equation:\\nh(w_n) + w_n = 3n^2 (c + α) + 3n (c + α)^2 + (c + α)^3\\nAnd w_n = {3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3}\\nNow, the right side is a quadratic in n, left side is h(w_n) + w_n.\\nAs n->∞, if c + α ≠ 0, right side ~ 3n^2 (c+α), so |right side| -> ∞.\\nLeft side, w_n in [0,1), so |w_n| <1, so |h(w_n)| must -> ∞.\\nBut for this to hold for all n, and w_n is specific, it might be possible only if c+α =0, but c+α = h(α) + α = f(α), and if f(α) =0 for all α, but then at α=0, f(0)=0, at α=0.5, f(0.5)=0, but f(1) = f(0.5 + 0.5) wait, not helpful, but f(1) =1, and f(0.5) =0, but f(1) = f(2*0.5) =2 f(0.5) =0, contradiction to f(1)=1.\\nSo f(α) = c+α =0 for all α implies f=0 on [0,1), but then f(1) = f(0+1) = f(0)+1=1, but 1 not in [0,1), but f(1) should be limit or something, but anyway, f(0.5) =0, f(1) =1, but 2* f(0.5) =0, f(1) =1, not equal, contradiction.\\nTherefore, for each α, c+α ≠ 0, so right side grows like 3n^2 (c+α).\\nNow, the only way this can hold is if h(w_n) is approximately 3n^2 (c+α) - w_n, which is roughly 3n^2 (c+α).\\nBut w_n = {3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3} = 3n^2 α + 3n α^2 + α^3 - k_n for some integer k_n.\\nSo w_n = 3n^2 α + lower terms - k_n.\\nNow, h(w_n) must be large.\\nBut also, from earlier, for the same α, at points {r β} with β=α, h({r α}) = r h(α) = r c.\\nBut w_n may not be of the form {r α} for rational r.\\nIn fact, w_n is generally not in that set.\\nSo no direct conflict.\\nHowever, perhaps for most α, the sequence w_n is such that it doesn't hit the points where h is defined to be large in a way that matches, but since we can define h arbitrarily as long as it satisfies the functional equations, it might be possible, but it's complicated.\\nGiven that in olympiad problems, usually only nice solutions are expected, and we have two solutions: f=0 and f(x)=x.\\nMoreover, let's verify if there are others.\\nSuppose f(x) = x for all x, works.\\nf(x) = 0, works.\\nIs f(x) = kx work? f(x f(y) + y^3) = k (x k y + y^3) = k^2 x y + k y^3.\\nRight side y f(x) + f(y)^3 = y (k x) + (k y)^3 = k x y + k^3 y^3.\\nEqual only if k^2 = k and k = k^3, so k(k-1)=0 and k^3-k=0, so k=0 or k=1.\\nSo only linear solutions are 0 and identity.\\nPerhaps no others.\\nI think it's safe to conclude that the only solutions are f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe need a finite set A of at least two positive integers, and an infinite set B of positive integers, such that:\\n1. Any two distinct elements in A+B are coprime.\\n2. For any coprime positive integers m,n, there exists x in A+B such that x ≡ n mod m.\\n\\nA+B = {a+b | a∈A, b∈B}.\\n\\nFirst, condition 2 means that A+B is dense in the integers in the sense of Chinese Remainder Theorem; specifically, it hits every residue class modulo m for every m, but only when gcd(n,m)=1, it hits n mod m.\\nMore precisely, for every m and every n coprime to m, there is x in A+B with x≡n mod m.\\nThis means that A+B intersects every residue class that is coprime to the modulus.\\nIn particular, for prime p, A+B must contain elements congruent to 1,2,...,p-1 mod p, since all are coprime to p.\\nSo A+B is dense in the profinite topology or something, but more importantly, it must be that A+B contains numbers coprime to every integer, but stronger.\\n\\nCondition 1: any two distinct elements in A+B are coprime.\\nThat means that for any two different elements s,t in A+B, gcd(s,t)=1.\\n\\nBut A+B is infinite, since B is infinite, A finite, so A+B is infinite.\\nAn infinite set where any two distinct elements are coprime.\\nIs that possible?\\nFor example, the set of all primes: any two distinct primes are coprime, yes.\\nOr the set {2,3,5,7,...} all primes.\\nBut can we make it of the form A+B with A finite, |A|≥2, B infinite.\\n\\nSuppose A has two elements, say A={a1,a2}.\\nThen A+B = {a1+b, a2+b | b∈B}.\\nThis is a union of two arithmetic progressions with difference 1 in b, but shifted.\\nAs b varies, a1+b and a2+b are just shifts.\\nFor example, if B is all integers greater than some N, then A+B is all integers greater than min A + N, but then many pairs are not coprime, e.g., two evens.\\nBut we need any two distinct elements coprime.\\nSo in particular, no two elements can share a common prime factor.\\nThat means that for each prime p, at most one element in A+B is divisible by p.\\nBecause if two elements are divisible by p, their gcd is at least p>1.\\nSo A+B can contain at most one multiple of each prime.\\nBut A+B is infinite, and there are infinitely many primes, so it's possible in theory, like the set of primes itself.\\nBut can it be written as A+B with A finite, B infinite.\\n\\nSuppose A={a1,a2}, then A+B = S1 ∪ S2, where S1 = a1 + B, S2 = a2 + B.\\nS1 and S2 are both infinite sets, since B infinite.\\nNow, within S1, any two distinct elements are a1+b and a1+b' for b≠b', so their difference is b-b', so if b-b' is divisible by some d, but gcd(a1+b, a1+b') may not be 1.\\nFor example, if b and b' are such that a1+b and a1+b' are both even, then gcd at least 2.\\nTo avoid that, for each prime p, at most one element in S1 is divisible by p, similarly for S2.\\nBut also between S1 and S2, for example, a1+b and a2+b' must be coprime for all b,b', and if b=b', then a1+b and a2+b, their gcd must be 1 for all b.\\nIn particular, for each b, gcd(a1+b, a2+b) = gcd(a1+b, (a2+b)-(a1+b)) = gcd(a1+b, a2-a1).\\nThis must be 1 for all b.\\nSo gcd(a1+b, d) =1 for all b, where d = |a2-a1|.\\nBut as b varies, a1+b runs through all integers congruent to a1 mod 1, i.e., all integers, so gcd(k, d) =1 for all integers k? Impossible unless d=1, because if d>1, take k=d, gcd(d,d)=d>1.\\nSo d=1, so |a2-a1|=1.\\nSo the two elements in A differ by 1.\\nSay A={k, k+1} for some k.\\nThen for each b, gcd(k+b, k+1+b) = gcd(k+b,1) =1, good.\\nNow, within S1 = k + B, we need that any two distinct elements are coprime.\\nSimilarly for S2 = k+1 + B.\\nAlso, between S1 and S2, we have elements like k+b and k+1+b' for b≠b', must be coprime.\\nBut since we already have that for same b, it's coprime, but for different b, it might not be.\\nBut the main constraint is within each shift.\\nSo for S1 = k + B, we need that for any two distinct b1,b2 in B, gcd(k+b1, k+b2) =1.\\nSimilarly for k+1+B.\\nNow, gcd(k+b1, k+b2) = gcd(k+b1, (k+b2)-(k+b1)) = gcd(k+b1, b2-b1).\\nThis must be 1 for all b1≠b2 in B.\\nSimilarly, gcd(k+1+b1, b2-b1) =1 for all b1≠b2.\\nNow, b2-b1 is the difference, which can be any non-zero integer that is difference of two elements in B.\\nSince B is infinite, the set of differences D = {b2-b1 | b1,b2 ∈ B, b1≠b2} is infinite, and contains arbitrarily large integers.\\nNow, for each fixed difference d ≠0, and for each b1 such that b1 and b1+d in B, we need gcd(k+b1, d) =1 and gcd(k+1+b1, d)=1.\\nBut since B is infinite, for a fixed d, there might be b1 such that b1 and b1+d in B, or not, depending on B.\\nTo ensure that for all such pairs, the gcd is 1, we need that whenever b1 and b1+d are in B, then gcd(k+b1, d)=1 and gcd(k+1+b1, d)=1.\\nBut this must hold for all d that occur as differences in B.\\nMoreover, for the set to be defined, B must be such that its difference set is controlled.\\nAdditionally, we have the density condition: for any coprime m,n, there is x in A+B with x≡n mod m.\\nA+B = (k+B) ∪ (k+1+B).\\nSo the union of two shifts of B.\\nNow, B is a subset of positive integers.\\nNow, the condition is that this union hits every residue class coprime to m, for every m.\\nIn particular, for large m, it must hit many classes.\\nBut also, from the coprimality within, for the set k+B, any two elements must be coprime, which is very restrictive.\\nIn fact, for k+B, the set must be such that no two elements share a common prime factor, so as before, for each prime p, at most one element in k+B is divisible by p.\\nSimilarly for k+1+B.\\nBut since k+B and k+1+B are disjoint (because k+b = k+1+b' implies b=b'+1, but b,b' in B, so if B has no consecutive, but not necessarily), but in general, they might overlap, but probably not.\\nBut anyway, the whole A+B can have at most one multiple of each prime, because if two elements are divisible by p, gcd at least p>1.\\nSo A+B contains at most one multiple of each prime.\\nBut A+B is infinite, so it must contain infinitely many elements, each divisible by a different prime, but since there are infinitely many primes, ok.\\nBut more importantly, the elements are pairwise coprime.\\nNow, for the density condition, for example, take m=2, n=1, gcd(1,2)=1, so there must be x in A+B with x≡1 mod 2, i.e., odd.\\nSimilarly, for n=1, m=3, x≡1 mod 3, etc.\\nBut since A+B has only one even number (at most), but there are infinitely many odd residue classes required, but the evenness is not the issue.\\nFor m=2, we need an odd number in A+B, which is fine, as long as there is at least one.\\nSimilarly for other m.\\nBut the problem is that A+B must intersect every residue class that is coprime to m.\\nFor example, for m=p prime, it must contain elements congruent to 1,2,3,...,p-1 mod p.\\nThat's p-1 different residue classes.\\nBut A+B is infinite, so potentially can do it.\\nHowever, the constraint that pairwise coprime is strong.\\nIn particular, since any two distinct elements are coprime, the set A+B must be such that no prime divides more than one element.\\nSo the prime factors are all distinct across the set.\\nNow, for the density, consider a large prime q.\\nThen for m=q, we need that for each r=1,2,...,q-1, there is x in A+B with x≡r mod q.\\nSince there are q-1 such r, and q is large, we need at least q-1 elements in A+B that are not divisible by q (since if x≡r≠0 mod q, not divisible by q).\\nBut since A+B has at most one element divisible by q, all other elements are not divisible by q, so as long as |A+B| >1, which it is, there are many elements not div by q.\\nBut we need specifically that for each r=1 to q-1, there is some x≡r mod q.\\nSo the set A+B must cover all nonzero residues mod q.\\nThat is, A+B is dense modulo q for every prime q.\\nIn fact, for every m, it must cover all residues coprime to m, but for prime m=q, it's all nonzero residues.\\nSo for every prime q, A+B is dense modulo q; specifically, it hits all nonzero residues mod q.\\nNow, A+B = (k+B) ∪ (k+1+B).\\nSo the union of two shifts of B.\\nB is a subset of positive integers.\\nNow, for a fixed prime q, the set B modulo q is some subset S of Z/qZ.\\nThen k+B modulo q is k+S, k+1+B is k+1+S.\\nSo A+B mod q is (k+S) ∪ (k+1+S).\\nThis must contain all nonzero residues mod q.\\nSo (k+S) ∪ (k+1+S) = (Z/qZ) \\\\ {0}.\\nSince q is large, and S is a subset, the size of (k+S) ∪ (k+1+S) is at most 2|S|, and at least |S| + |S| - |intersection|.\\nBut it must have size q-1.\\nSo 2|S| ≥ q-1, so |S| ≥ (q-1)/2.\\nSo B must be dense modulo q; specifically, |B mod q| ≥ (q-1)/2.\\nThis for every prime q.\\nAdditionally, we have the pairwise coprimality.\\nNow, for the set k+B, we need that for any two distinct b1,b2 in B, gcd(k+b1, k+b2) =1.\\nAs before, gcd(k+b1, b2-b1) =1.\\nSimilarly, gcd(k+1+b1, b2-b1) =1.\\nNow, b2-b1 can be any difference in B.\\nLet D be the set of differences in B, i.e., D = {d | d = b2-b1 for some b1<b2 in B}.\\nThen for each d in D, and for each b1 such that b1 and b1+d in B, we need gcd(k+b1, d) =1 and gcd(k+1+b1, d)=1.\\nTo make this possible, perhaps B is sparse.\\nBut from the density modulo q, B must be fairly dense modulo every q.\\nIn particular, for large q, |B cap [1,N]| must be at least c N for some c, but not necessarily, because modulo q, it could be that B is periodic or something.\\nBut the condition is for each q, the reduction is large.\\nNow, suppose that B is the set of all integers greater than some N, but then A+B is all integers greater than min A + N, and then many pairs are not coprime, e.g., two evens.\\nSo B must be sparse.\\nSuppose B is the set of factorials or something, but let's see.\\nAnother idea: suppose that A+B is the set of all prime numbers.\\nThen any two distinct primes are coprime, good.\\nAnd for any coprime m,n, by Dirichlet's theorem, if gcd(n,m)=1, there are infinitely many primes congruent to n mod m, so certainly there is one in A+B, good.\\nSo if we can write the set of primes as A+B with A finite, |A|≥2, B infinite.\\nIs that possible?\\nA+B = {a+b | a∈A, b∈B}.\\nSuppose A has two elements, a1,a2.\\nThen the set of primes is contained in (a1+B) ∪ (a2+B).\\nBut a1+B and a2+B are two arithmetic progressions if B is an AP, but B is a set.\\nSuppose B is such that a1+B and a2+B cover all primes.\\nBut the set of primes has density zero, while a1+B for B infinite has positive density if B has positive density, but not necessarily.\\nFor example, if B is the set of primes minus a1, but then a1+B = a1 + (P - a1) = P, good, but then A has only one element if we want only a1, but A must have at least two elements.\\nIf A={a1,a2}, then A+B = (a1+B) ∪ (a2+B), which would include a2+B, which may not be prime.\\nSo unless a2+B consists of primes, but then it's extra.\\nBut the set A+B would be larger than the primes, so it may contain composite numbers, but then if it contains a composite number, say c, and a prime p, if gcd(c,p)=1, it might be ok, but if c and another element share a factor, problem.\\nBut in particular, if A+B contains a composite number, and also contains a multiple of a prime dividing it, but since pairwise coprime, no two elements can share a common prime factor.\\nSo if c is composite, say c=4, then no other element can be even, and no other element can be divisible by 2, but since c=4 is divisible by 2, no other element can be divisible by 2, so all other elements must be odd.\\nBut also, if c=9, no other element divisible by 3, etc.\\nBut for the set to include all primes, but if it contains 4, then no even prime, but 2 is even, so if 2 is in A+B, and 4 is in A+B, gcd(2,4)=2>1, not coprime.\\nSo if 2 is in A+B, then no other even number can be in A+B, and in particular, no multiple of 2 except possibly 2 itself.\\nBut if 2 is in A+B, and A+B contains other primes, which are odd, gcd(2,odd)=1, good.\\nBut if we have a composite number that is even, like 4, then gcd(2,4)>1, not good.\\nSo if 2 is in A+B, then no other even number can be in A+B.\\nSimilarly, if a prime p is in A+B, then no other multiple of p can be in A+B.\\nNow, for the density, we need that for every m, and n coprime to m, there is x in A+B with x≡n mod m.\\nIn particular, for m=p prime, we need x≡1,2,3,...,p-1 mod p.\\nNow, if p is in A+B, then the only multiple of p in A+B is p itself, since if another multiple, gcd at least p.\\nSo for residue 0 mod p, only p itself can be in A+B, but we don't need to hit 0 mod p, only the coprime ones, which are 1 to p-1.\\nSo for x≡r mod p with r≠0, it can be done with numbers not divisible by p.\\nBut the issue is that A+B must contain elements in each of these classes.\\nNow, back to whether we can have A+B being the primes.\\nBut the primes are not of the form A+B with |A|≥2 finite, B infinite, because A+B would have at least two arithmetic progressions, but the primes are not contained in a finite union of APs with difference >1, but actually, by Dirichlet, they are dense in APs, but not contained in a finite union.\\nIn fact, the set of primes cannot be written as a finite union of APs, because each AP with difference d>1 has density 1/phi(d) or something, but more simply, if you have finitely many APs, their union has density less than 1, but primes have density 0, so possible in theory, but actually, a finite union of APs is periodic or has bounded gaps, while primes have unbounded gaps, but more importantly, if A+B with |A| finite, then A+B is a finite union of shifts of B, so if B is infinite, but the structure depends on B.\\nSuppose B is infinite, A={a1,a2}, then A+B = (a1+B) ∪ (a2+B).\\nThis is contained in the union of two sets, each being a shift of B.\\nNow, the set of primes has the property that it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, by Green-Tao, but that might not help.\\nSuppose that the set of primes is equal to (a1+B) ∪ (a2+B) for some B.\\nThen for large x, the number of primes up to x is about x/log x.\\nNumber of elements in A+B up to x is | (a1+B) cap [1,x] | + | (a2+B) cap [1,x] | - |intersection|.\\nEach | (ai+B) cap [1,x] | is roughly |B cap [1,x]| if B is nice, but in general, let N_B(x) = |B cap [1,x]|.\\nThen | (ai+B) cap [1,x] | = |B cap [1,x - ai]| ≈ N_B(x) for large x.\\nSo |A+B cap [1,x]| ≤ 2 N_B(x) + C for some C.\\nBut |primes cap [1,x]| ~ x/log x.\\nSo 2 N_B(x) ≥ c x/log x for some c.\\nSo N_B(x) ≥ c' x/log x.\\nNow, B has at least c' x/log x elements up to x.\\nNow, within B, for the set k+B, we need pairwise coprime for the values k+b.\\nBut in our case, for A+B to be the primes, but A+B may not be exactly the primes, but could be a superset, as long as pairwise coprime and satisfies the density.\\nBut if A+B contains a composite number, say c, then since c is composite, it has a prime factor p, and c is divisible by p, so no other element in A+B can be divisible by p.\\nBut there are infinitely many primes, and for a prime q ≠ p, it may be in A+B, but if q is not divisible by p, gcd(c,q) may be 1, so ok, as long as no other element is divisible by p.\\nBut the problem is that for the density, we need to hit all residue classes coprime to m.\\nFor example, take m=p, the prime dividing c.\\nThen we need to hit all r=1,2,...,p-1 mod p.\\nBut since c is divisible by p, c≡0 mod p, but we don't need to hit 0, only 1 to p-1.\\nAnd since no other element is divisible by p, all other elements are not 0 mod p, so they are in 1 to p-1 mod p.\\nBut we need that every residue from 1 to p-1 is hit by some element in A+B.\\nSince A+B has infinitely many elements, and only p-1 classes, by pigeonhole, some class is hit infinitely often, but we need all classes hit.\\nSo as long as the set is large enough, it might be possible.\\nBut the issue is that for each such m, it must be covered.\\nNow, back to the construction.\\nSuppose we try to make A+B consist of numbers that are pairwise coprime.\\nFor example, take A = {1,2}, so |A|=2.\\nThen A+B = (1+B) ∪ (2+B).\\nWe need that any two distinct elements in this set are coprime.\\nAlso, for each b, gcd(1+b,2+b) = gcd(1+b,1) =1, good.\\nNow, gcd(1+b1,1+b2) = gcd(1+b1, b2-b1) must be 1 for b1≠b2.\\nSimilarly, gcd(2+b1,2+b2) = gcd(2+b1, b2-b1) =1.\\nAlso, gcd(1+b1,2+b2) for b1≠b2, which is gcd(1+b1, (2+b2)-(1+b1)) = gcd(1+b1,1 + b2 - b1), which may not be 1, but must be 1.\\nSo additional constraint.\\nTo simplify, perhaps make B such that the differences are controlled.\\nSuppose that B is the set of all powers of 2, B={2^k for k=1,2,3,...}.\\nThen A+B = {1+2^k, 2+2^k for k=1,2,3,...} = {3,4,5,6,9,10,17,18,33,34,...}.\\nNow, check pairwise gcd.\\nTake 3 and 4, gcd(3,4)=1.\\n3 and 5, gcd=1.\\n3 and 6, gcd=3>1! Oh, 3 and 6, both in set, 6=2+4=2+2^2, 3=1+2^1, gcd(3,6)=3>1, not good.\\nAnd 6 is divisible by 3, 3 is divisible by 3.\\nSo not good.\\nSuppose B is the set of factorials, B={k! for k=1,2,3,...}.\\nThen A+B = {1+k!, 2+k!}.\\nFor large k, k! is divisible by all small numbers.\\nTake b1=1! =1, b2=2! =2, then 1+b1=2, 1+b2=3, gcd(2,3)=1.\\n2+b1=3, 2+b2=4, gcd(3,4)=1.\\nBut 1+b1=2, 2+b1=3, gcd(2,3)=1.\\nNow 1+b2=3, 2+b1=3, same element? 1+2=3, 2+1=3, so if 3 appears twice, but in set it's once, so distinct elements.\\nTake b3=6, 1+6=7, 2+6=8.\\ngcd(7,8)=1, gcd(7,2)=1, gcd(7,3)=1, gcd(7,4)=1, gcd(8,2)=2>1! 8 and 2, both in set, gcd(8,2)=2>1.\\n2=1+1!, 8=2+6=2+3!, so yes, gcd(2,8)=2>1.\\nAnd 2 and 8 both even.\\nSo not good.\\nTo avoid small prime factors, perhaps make B consist of large numbers.\\nSuppose that B is the set of primorials or something.\\nAnother idea: make B such that all elements in B are very large and coprime in some way.\\nPerhaps make A+B be the set of all prime numbers.\\nBut as before, can we write the primes as A+B with |A|≥2.\\nSuppose A={0,1}, but A should be positive integers, so a≥1.\\nA={1,2} as before.\\nSuppose that the primes are partitioned into two sets, P1 and P2, and B is such that 1+B = P1, 2+B = P2.\\nThen B = P1 -1 = {p-1 | p in P1}, and also B = P2 -2 = {q-2 | q in P2}.\\nSo P1 -1 = P2 -2, so P1 = P2 -1.\\nSo the set of primes minus 1 equals the set of primes minus 2, shifted.\\nP1 = {p | p prime, p in P1} = P2 -1 = {q-1 | q in P2, q prime}.\\nSo for each p in P1, p+1 in P2, and for each q in P2, q-1 in P1.\\nSo P1 and P2 are such that P2 = P1 +1.\\nSo the primes are partitioned into P1 and P1+1.\\nBut P1+1 is the set {p+1 | p in P1}, which are even if p odd, so greater than 2, not prime, contradiction unless p=2, but 2+1=3 prime, but then 3 in P2, so 3-1=2 in P1, good, but next, if 3 in P2, then 3-1=2 in P1, already have, but what about 5? If 5 in P1, then 6 in P2, but 6 not prime. If 5 in P2, then 4 in P1, not prime. So cannot include 5. Similarly for other primes. So only possible for {2,3}, but not infinite. So impossible.\\nTherefore, cannot write primes as A+B with |A|=2.\\nPerhaps with larger A, but likely not.\\nAnother idea: make A+B be the set of all numbers of the form p where p prime, or 1, but 1 is not prime, and gcd(1,p)=1, good, but 1 may not be in A+B.\\nBut still, same issue.\\nPerhaps make A+B be a set like {2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,13,16,...} but ensuring pairwise coprime.\\nBut if 4 and 2 are both in, gcd=2>1.\\nSo cannot have both 2 and 4.\\nIn fact, for each prime, at most one multiple.\\nSo the set can contain at most one even number, for example.\\nSimilarly for each prime.\\nSo the set is very sparse.\\nNow for the density condition, for a large prime q, we need to hit q-1 different residue classes mod q.\\nSince the set is infinite, it can do it, but the values are large.\\nBut the problem is that with A finite, A+B is a finite union of shifts of B, so its values are correlated.\\nPerhaps it is impossible.\\nSuppose that such A and B exist.\\nLet d = |a2 - a1| for a1,a2 in A, but A may have more than 2 elements.\\nLet a_min = min A, a_max = max A.\\nThen for large b, the elements a+b for a in A are between a_min + b and a_max + b.\\nAs b varies, these are intervals of length a_max - a_min.\\nNow, for a large prime q > a_max - a_min, consider modulo q.\\nA+B must contain an element congruent to r mod q for each r=1,2,...,q-1.\\nSince q is large, and the set A+B has elements, but for a fixed b, the set {a+b | a in A} is an interval of |A| consecutive integers if A is interval, but A is finite set, not necessarily consecutive.\\nBut in general, the values a+b for fixed b are |A| numbers in an interval of length diam(A) = max A - min A.\\nLet D = diam(A).\\nFor large q > D, the set {a+b | a in A} modulo q is just a shift of A modulo q, so it occupies |A| residues mod q.\\nAs b varies, we get different shifts.\\nFor each b, we get a set of |A| values in A+B.\\nTo cover all q-1 nonzero residues, since each b contributes |A| values, and there are infinitely many b, but the values may repeat or overlap.\\nThe total number of elements in A+B up to X is roughly |A| |B cap [1,X]|, since for each b, |A| elements, but may have overlaps if a1+b1 = a2+b2 for (a1,b1)≠(a2,b2), but in general, if B is sparse, few overlaps.\\nBut for the covering, for a fixed q, we need that the union over b of (A + b) mod q covers all nonzero residues.\\nA + b mod q is A shifted by b mod q.\\nAs b runs through B, b mod q runs through some set S subset Z/qZ.\\nThen A+B mod q = { a + s | a in A, s in S } = A + S.\\nThis must contain (Z/qZ) \\\\ {0}.\\nSo A + S = (Z/qZ) \\\\ {0}.\\n| A + S | ≤ |A| |S|, and must be at least q-1.\\nSo |A| |S| ≥ q-1.\\n|S| = |{ b mod q | b in B }|, the size of the projection.\\nSo for each prime q > D, |B mod q| ≥ (q-1)/|A|.\\nSince |A| is fixed, for large q, |B mod q| ≥ c q for c=1/|A|.\\nSo B is dense modulo q for all large primes q.\\nNow, additionally, we have the pairwise coprimality.\\nIn particular, for the set A+B, any two distinct elements are coprime.\\nConsider two elements from the same shift, say a + b1 and a + b2 for b1≠b2 in B, a in A.\\nThen gcd(a+b1, a+b2) = gcd(a+b1, b2-b1).\\nThis must be 1.\\nSimilarly for different a.\\nNow, b2-b1 can be various values.\\nSince B is infinite, there are arbitrarily large differences.\\nLet d = b2 - b1 ≠0.\\nThen gcd(a+b1, d) =1.\\nThis must hold for all such pairs.\\nIn particular, for a fixed d, if there are b1, b1+d in B, then gcd(a+b1, d) =1 for each a in A.\\nSince this must hold for all a in A, and A has at least two elements, say a1,a2.\\nSo gcd(a1+b1, d) =1 and gcd(a2+b1, d) =1.\\nNow, b1 can vary.\\nFor B to be dense modulo q for all q, it must be that B has positive upper density or something, but not necessarily.\\nFor example, the set of squares is not dense mod q for q=4, since squares are 0 or 1 mod 4, not 2 or 3.\\nBut in our case, B must be dense mod q for all large q.\\nIn fact, |B mod q| ≥ c q for c>0, so B is relatively dense.\\nNow, the condition gcd(a+b1, d) =1 for all a in A, whenever b1 and b1+d in B.\\nThis means that a+b1 is coprime to d for all a in A.\\nSo the number a+b1 is coprime to d for each a in A.\\nSince A has at least two elements, say a1,a2, then a1+b1 and a2+b1 are both coprime to d.\\nTheir difference is a2-a1, fixed.\\nBut more importantly, the values a+b1 for a in A are |A| consecutive or something, but not necessarily.\\nBut they are |A| numbers, and all must be coprime to d.\\nFor this to happen for many b1, and for various d, it might be difficult.\\nSuppose that d is large, and has many prime factors.\\nThen for a+b1 to be coprime to d, it must not be divisible by any prime dividing d.\\nSince there are |A| such numbers, and they are close together if A is small, the probability might be low, but in deterministic setting.\\nSuppose that A has diameter D.\\nThen the set {a+b1 | a in A} is contained in an interval of length D.\\nFor this interval to contain no multiple of any prime dividing d, but since the interval has length D, if d has a prime factor p > D, then the interval can contain at most one multiple of p, so it's possible to avoid if we are lucky, but we need that none of the |A| points are divisible by any prime dividing d.\\nBut the points are specific.\\nTo ensure that for every d that is a difference in B, and for every b1 with b1, b1+d in B, the set {a+b1 | a in A} consists of numbers all coprime to d.\\nThis is very restrictive.\\nIn particular, if d is divisible by a prime p, then no a+b1 is divisible by p.\\nSo for each such b1, and for each p| d, a+b1 not≡ 0 mod p for all a in A.\\nThat is, b1 not≡ -a mod p for any a in A.\\nSo b1 not in -A mod p.\\nSince this must hold for all p| d, and d can have many prime factors.\\nBut d = b2 - b1, which depends on b1,b2.\\nPerhaps for B to satisfy this, it must be that differences are smooth or something.\\nBut from the density, B must be dense mod q for all q, which suggests that B has many prime factors in its differences.\\nIn fact, if B is dense mod q for all q, then the difference set generates all integers or something.\\nPerhaps it is impossible.\\nAssume that such A,B exist.\\nLet p be a large prime.\\nThen from earlier, |B mod p| ≥ c p for c=1/|A|.\\nAlso, A+B must contain an element congruent to 1 mod p.\\nLet x be such an element, x = a + b for some a in A, b in B, and x≡1 mod p.\\nSimilarly, there is y = a' + b' ≡2 mod p, etc.\\nBut more importantly, since A+B has only one multiple of p, because if two elements divisible by p, gcd at least p>1.\\nSo there is at most one element in A+B that is 0 mod p.\\nFor the other residues, we have elements.\\nNow, the number of elements in A+B up to X is roughly |A| times |B cap [1,X]|.\\n|B cap [1,X]| must be at least c X / log X or something, but from |B mod q| ≥ c q for large q, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, B must have positive density in some sense.\\nIn fact, if a set is dense modulo every large prime, then it must have positive upper density.\\nFor example, by the Erdős–Turán inequality or something, but intuitively, if it's not dense, it avoids some residue classes.\\nSuppose that the upper density of B is 0.\\nThen for large X, |B cap [1,X]| = o(X).\\nBut for a prime q, |B mod q| is the number of residue classes hit, and if |B cap [1,X]| is small, it might not hit many classes, but for q large, if X is large, it could still hit many if B is spread out.\\nFor example, the set of squares has density 0, and for q=4, hits only 2 classes, but for q large, it hits about q/2 classes or something, but not c q for c>0.\\nIn fact, for squares, |{ k^2 mod q }| is about q/2 for q prime, by properties of quadratic residues.\\nFor q prime, there are (q+1)/2 quadratic residues including 0, so (q-1)/2 nonzero, so |squares mod q| = (q+1)/2 ~ q/2, so |S| ~ q/2, so |A| |S| ~ |A| q/2, which for |A|≥2, is at least q, but we need |A+S| ≥ q-1, and |A+S| ≤ |A| |S|, but also |A+S| could be less than |A| |S| if not full.\\nIn our case, we need |A+S| ≥ q-1, and |A| |S| ≥ q-1, which is satisfied if |S| ≥ (q-1)/|A|.\\nFor squares, |S| ~ q/2, so for |A|≥2, (q-1)/|A| ≤ q/2 for large q, so it's satisfied.\\nBut for squares, it may not satisfy the pairwise coprime condition.\\nBut in our case, for B the squares, A={1,2}, then A+B = {1+k^2, 2+k^2}.\\nTake k=1, 1+1=2, 2+1=3.\\nk=2, 1+4=5, 2+4=6.\\ngcd(2,6)=2>1, not good.\\nSame issue.\\nTo make the values large and coprime, perhaps take B to be very sparse.\\nSuppose that B is the set of very large numbers, say b_k = k! * M for some M, but then differences are large.\\nPerhaps take B to be the set of primorials, b_k = p_k# = product of first k primes.\\nThen b_k is divisible by all primes ≤ p_k.\\nThen A+B = {a + b_k for a in A, k=1,2,3,...}.\\nFor large k, b_k is very large and divisible by many primes.\\nThen a + b_k is coprime to all primes ≤ p_k, since b_k ≡0 mod p for p≤p_k, so a + b_k ≡ a mod p, and if a not≡0 mod p, then not divisible by p.\\nSince A is finite, for large k, p_k > max A, so for p ≤ p_k, if p does not divide a, then a + b_k not divisible by p.\\nBut if p divides a, then a + b_k ≡0 mod p, so divisible by p.\\nTo avoid that, perhaps make A consist of numbers coprime to all small primes, but A is fixed.\\nSuppose that A is such that no a in A is divisible by any prime, impossible.\\nFor example, if a is even, then for p=2, if 2 divides a, then a + b_k ≡0 mod 2, so divisible by 2.\\nThen if there is another element in A+B divisible by 2, gcd at least 2.\\nSo to have only one even number in A+B, but there are infinitely many k, so infinitely many a + b_k, and if a is even, then a + b_k is even for all k, since b_k even for k≥1 (as 2| b_k), so all a + b_k for that a are even, so infinitely many even numbers, so many pairs have gcd at least 2, not good.\\nIf a is odd, then a + b_k is odd, since b_k even, so not even.\\nSo to avoid even numbers, all a in A must be odd, then a + b_k is odd for all a,k, so no even numbers in A+B, good for avoiding gcd 2.\\nSimilarly for other primes.\\nFor a prime p, if p divides some a in A, then for large k, p | b_k, so a + b_k ≡0 mod p, so divisible by p.\\nAnd if there is only one such a, but for that a, for all large k, a + b_k is divisible by p, so infinitely many multiples of p in A+B, so many pairs have gcd at least p, not good.\\nTherefore, to avoid that, no a in A should be divisible by any prime, impossible.\\nSo for each prime p, if p divides some a in A, then for large k, p | b_k, so a + b_k ≡0 mod p, so divisible by p, and since there are infinitely many k, infinitely many such elements, so cannot have pairwise coprime.\\nTherefore, to prevent that, for each prime p, no a in A is divisible by p, which is impossible since a are positive integers greater than 1.\\nUnless A contains 1, but 1 is not divisible by any prime, good.\\nSo if 1 in A, then for a=1, 1 + b_k, and 1 not divisible by any prime, so 1 + b_k may not be divisible by small primes.\\nIn fact, for p ≤ p_k, b_k ≡0 mod p, so 1 + b_k ≡1 mod p, not 0, so not divisible by p.\\nFor p > p_k, may or may not be.\\nSo 1 + b_k is not divisible by any prime ≤ p_k.\\nSimilarly for other a in A.\\nBut if another a in A, say a=3, then if 3 in A, then for k such that p_k ≥3, b_k divisible by 3, so 3 + b_k ≡0 mod 3, so divisible by 3.\\nThen for each such k, 3 + b_k is divisible by 3.\\nAnd if there are infinitely many k, infinitely many multiples of 3, so gcd at least 3 for any two, not good.\\nTherefore, the only a in A that can be used are those not divisible by any prime, i.e., a=1.\\nBut A must have at least two elements, so cannot have only a=1.\\nIf A contains 1 and another number c>1, then c is divisible by some prime p, and for large k, p | b_k, so c + b_k ≡0 mod p, so divisible by p, and infinitely many such, so not good.\\nTherefore, with this B, it doesn't work.\\nPerhaps make B not include the small primes, but then may not be dense mod q.\\nPerhaps it is impossible.\\nSuppose that such A,B exist.\\nLet p be a large prime.\\nThen as above, |B mod p| ≥ c p.\\nAlso, there is at most one element in A+B divisible by p.\\nNow, the number of elements in A+B up to X is N(X) = |A+B cap [1,X]|.\\nFor large X, this is roughly |A| |B cap [1,X]|.\\nNow, the number of elements divisible by p is at most 1, for each p.\\nBy the sieve, the number of elements in A+B up to X not divisible by any prime ≤ Y is at least N(X) prod_{p≤Y} (1-1/p) times some factor, but roughly, if the set is random, but in this case, since for each p, at most one element is divisible by p, the set is very thin.\\nIn fact, the sum over x in A+B of 1/x diverges if it's infinite, but for pairwise coprime infinite set, it may converge or diverge.\\nFor example, the primes have sum 1/p divergent.\\nBut in our case, the elements may be larger.\\nSuppose that the elements of A+B are very large.\\nBut from the density mod q, for large q, B must have many elements, so A+B has many elements.\\nIn particular, for a large prime q, |B mod q| ≥ c q, so the number of b in B up to X is at least c X / q for X large, but this is for fixed q, not helpful.\\nBy the pigeonhole principle, since |B mod q| ≥ c q, the minimal number up to X is at least c X / q for X > q, but to have many classes, B must have at least c q elements in [1,q], for example, but not necessarily.\\nActually, a set can have many residue classes with few elements if the elements are large, but for modulo q, the values depend on b mod q, so to have many different b mod q, you need many b in different classes, so |B cap [1,q]| ≥ |B mod q| ≥ c q, so for each large prime q, |B cap [1,q]| ≥ c q.\\nBut |B cap [1,q]| ≤ q, so c q ≤ q, so c ≤1, which is true, but for large q, |B cap [1,q]| ≥ c q, which means that B has positive lower density at least c.\\nIn particular, liminf |B cap [1,X]| / X ≥ c >0.\\nSo B has positive lower density.\\nThen |A+B cap [1,X]| ≥ |A| |B cap [1,X - a_max]| ≥ |A| c (X - a_max) /2 for large X, so |A+B| has positive lower density.\\nNow, in a set of positive lower density, there are many pairs that are not coprime.\\nIn particular, for a prime p, the proportion of elements divisible by p is at least the density times 1/p or something, but in this case, since at most one element is divisible by p, the number of elements in A+B up to X divisible by p is at most 1, so the proportion is at most 1/X, which ->0 as X->infty.\\nBut for a random set of density d, the proportion divisible by p is about d / p, which is positive, but here it's o(1), so ok.\\nBut the issue is that for pairwise coprime, it's possible, like the primes have density 0, but here we have positive density, is that possible?\\nCan there be an infinite set of positive lower density where any two distinct elements are coprime?\\nSuppose S is such a set, lower density δ>0.\\nThen for large X, |S cap [1,X]| ≥ (δ/2) X.\\nNow, the number of pairs (s,t) with s<t in S cap [1,X] is at least c X^2 for some c>0.\\nFor each such pair, gcd(s,t)=1.\\nBut by the law of large numbers, the probability that two random numbers are coprime is 6/π^2 >0, so it's possible in theory, but here the set is structured.\\nIn this case, since the set has positive density, and is pairwise coprime, is it possible?\\nFor example, take S to be the set of all integers in [2^k, 2^{k+1}) that are prime, but then density may not be positive.\\nActually, the maximal density of a pairwise coprime set is 0, I think.\\nFor example, if S has positive density, then by Szemerédi or something, but more simply, the sum of 1/s for s in S diverges if density positive, but for pairwise coprime, the sum may converge.\\nIn fact, for the set to be pairwise coprime, the events \"divisible by p\" are mutually exclusive for each p, but not quite.\\nSpecifically, for each prime p, at most one s in S is divisible by p.\\nTherefore, the sum over s in S of 1/s ≤ sum over p prime 1/p, because each s>1 is divisible by some p, and each p is used by at most one s, and for that s, 1/s ≤ 1/p if s≥p, but s could be large.\\nIf s is divisible by p, and s≥p, then 1/s ≤ 1/p.\\nAnd since each p has at most one s associated, sum_{s in S, s>1} 1/s ≤ sum_p 1/p = ∞.\\nBut sum 1/p diverges, so this doesn't help.\\nIn fact, sum 1/s could diverge, like for primes.\\nBut in our case, with positive density, sum_{s≤X} 1/s ~ log X, while for a set of density d, sum_{s≤X} 1/s ~ d log X, which also diverges, so no contradiction.\\nHowever, the pairwise coprime condition with positive density might be possible, but in this structured form, perhaps not.\\nBut in our case, we have additional structure from A+B.\\nPerhaps for the set A+B with A finite, B infinite with positive density, and pairwise coprime, it might be impossible because of the correlations.\\nBut to save time, perhaps the answer is that no such set exists.\\nMaybe yes.\\nAnother idea: take A = {1,2}, and B = { n! | n=1,2,3,... }.\\nThen A+B = {1+n!, 2+n!}.\\nFor n≥2, n! is divisible by 2, so 1+n! is odd, 2+n! is even.\\nSo 2+n! is even, and for m>n, 2+m! is even, and if m! > n!, 2+m! > 2+n!, and both even, so gcd at least 2>1, not good.\\nSame issue.\\nTake B = { p# | p prime }, the primorial, product of primes up to p.\\nThen for large p, p# is even, so 1+p# odd, 2+p# even.\\nAgain, 2+p# even for all p≥2, so infinitely many even numbers, gcd at least 2.\\nSo unless we avoid even numbers, but if A has an even number, then a+b may be even.\\nTo have no even numbers in A+B, all a in A must be odd, and all b in B must be even, then a+b odd, good.\\nSimilarly for other primes.\\nBut for a prime p, if p divides some a in A, then for b divisible by p, a+b ≡0 mod p, so divisible by p.\\nTo have only one such, but if B has infinitely many b divisible by p, then infinitely many a+b divisible by p, not good.\\nSo for each prime p, either no a in A is divisible by p, or only finitely many b in B are divisible by p.\\nBut if no a in A is divisible by p, then a+b ≡ a ≠0 mod p if a not div by p, so not div by p.\\nSo to have a+b not div by p, we need that for each p, either no a in A is div by p, or B has only finitely many b div by p.\\nSince A is finite, the set of p that divide some a in A is finite, say P_A.\\nFor p not in P_A, no a in A is div by p, so a+b not div by p as long as b not div by p or something, but a+b ≡ a mod p, and a not≡0 mod p, so a+b not≡0 mod p, so never div by p.\\nFor p in P_A, we need that B has only finitely many b divisible by p.\\nSo B is not divisible by p for large b, for each p in P_A.\\nSo B is eventually not divisible by any p in P_A.\\nNow, for the density mod q, for large prime q, |B mod q| ≥ c q.\\nB is not divisible by p for p in P_A for large b, so for large b, b not div by any p in P_A.\\nBut for mod q, it needs to hit many classes.\\nAlso, the pairwise coprime within the shifts.\\nBut perhaps possible.\\nFor example, take A = {1,3}, so P_A = {3}, since 3|3, 1 not div by 3.\\nThen for p=3, B must have only finitely many b divisible by 3.\\nFor other p, no restriction from this.\\nNow, B must have positive lower density, as established.\\nAnd |B mod q| ≥ c q for large q, with c=1/2 since |A|=2.\\nNow, construct B such that it is not divisible by 3 for large b, and has high density.\\nFor example, take B to be the set of all integers not divisible by 3, but then |B mod q| for q>3, if q not 3, may be large, but for q=3, |B mod 3| =2 (classes 1 and 2), and (q-1)/|A| =2/2=1, and 2>1, so ok.\\nBut B = {n | n not div by 3}, then |B cap [1,X]| ~ (2/3) X, so positive density.\\nThen A+B = {1+b, 3+b | b in B, b not div by 3}.\\nNow, 1+b: since b not div by 3, b≡1 or 2 mod 3, so 1+b≡2 or 0 mod 3.\\nIf b≡2 mod 3, 1+b≡0 mod 3, so divisible by 3.\\nSimilarly, 3+b≡0+b≡b≡1 or 2 mod 3, not 0, so not div by 3.\\nBut when b≡2 mod 3, 1+b≡0 mod 3, so divisible by 3.\\nAnd there are infinitely many such b (e.g., b=2,5,8,11,...), so infinitely many 1+b divisible by 3, so many pairs have gcd at least 3, not good.\\nTo avoid that, we need that for a=1, 1+b not div by 3, so 1+b not≡0 mod 3, so b not≡2 mod 3.\\nSimilarly, for a=3, 3+b≡b not≡0 mod 3, which is already true since b not div by 3.\\nSo we need b≡1 mod 3, so that 1+b≡2 not 0 mod 3, and 3+b≡1 not 0 mod 3.\\nSo let B = {b | b≡1 mod 3}.\\nThen B has density 1/3 >0.\\nThen A+B = {1+b, 3+b | b≡1 mod 3} = {1+(3k+1), 3+(3k+1) for k=0,1,2,...} = {3k+2, 3k+4} for k=0,1,2,...} = {2,5,8,11,14,17,...} and {4,7,10,13,16,19,...} so all integers ≥2 except those ≡0 mod 3? 2,4,5,7,8,10,11,13,14,16,17,19,... missing 3,6,9,12, etc., so all not divisible by 3.\\nNow, check pairwise gcd.\\nTake 2 and 4, gcd(2,4)=2>1.\\n2=1+1, 4=3+1, both for b=1, gcd(2,4)=2>1, not good.\\nAnd both even.\\nSo again, even numbers.\\nTo avoid even numbers, make all a in A odd, and all b in B odd, then a+b even? Odd + odd = even, so a+b even, so all elements in A+B are even, so gcd at least 2 for any two, not good.\\nIf a and b both odd, a+b even.\\nIf a even, b odd, a+b odd.\\nTo have a+b odd, need one even, one odd.\\nSo for each pair (a,b), if a and b have different parity, a+b odd.\\nBut in A+B, for fixed a,b, the parity of a+b depends on a and b.\\nTo have all a+b odd, we need that for all a in A, b in B, a and b have different parity.\\nBut A is fixed, so if A has an even number, then for b in B, to have a+b odd, b must be odd.\\nIf A has an odd number, b must be even.\\nBut A has at least two elements, say a1 even, a2 odd.\\nThen for a1 even, to have a1+b odd, b must be odd.\\nFor a2 odd, to have a2+b odd, b must be even.\\nContradiction; b cannot be both odd and even.\\nTherefore, it is impossible to have all elements in A+B odd.\\nIn fact, for any A with at least two elements of different parity, then for a given b, a1+b and a2+b have different parity if a1 and a2 have different parity, so one even, one odd.\\nBut then among the elements, there are both even and odd numbers.\\nMoreover, if there is an even number in A+B, and since there might be only one, but in this case, for each b, if a1 even, a1+b may be even or odd depending on b.\\nBut in particular, if there is an even number in A+B, say s, then s is divisible by 2, so no other element can be even, because if t even, gcd(s,t)≥2>1.\\nTherefore, there can be at most one even number in A+B.\\nSimilarly for any prime.\\nSo in particular, at most one even number.\\nBut if A has an even number a_even, and B is infinite, then for each b, a_even + b may be even or odd.\\nIf b is even, a_even + b even; if b odd, a_even + b odd.\\nTo have only one even number in A+B, we need that for only one pair (a,b) is a+b even, but since a_even is fixed, a_even + b is even when b is even.\\nSo if there is more than one b that is even, then a_even + b is even for each such b, so multiple even numbers, not good.\\nTherefore, B can have at most one even number.\\nSimilarly, if A has an odd number, a_odd + b is even when b is odd, so if B has more than one odd number, then a_odd + b is even for each such b, so multiple even numbers.\\nTherefore, to have at most one even number in A+B, we need that either:\\n- A has no even number, and B has at most one odd number, or\\n- A has no odd number, and B has at most one even number, or\\n- but A has at least two elements, so if all a in A are even, then a+b even when b even, so to have only one even number, B can have at most one even number, and for b odd, a+b odd, so many odd numbers, but the even number is only one.\\nSimilarly if all a in A are odd, then a+b even when b odd, so B can have at most one odd number.\\nBut B is infinite, so if B has at most one even number, then almost all b are odd, so infinitely many odd b, so if A has an even number, then for b odd, a_even + b is odd, for b even, a_even + b is even, but only one b even, so only one even number in A+B, good for the even prime.\\nSimilarly for other primes.\\nSo possible in theory.\\nFor example, take A = {2,4}, both even.\\nThen B must have at most one even number, and since B infinite, most b are odd.\\nThen for b odd, a+b = even + odd = odd, so a+b odd.\\nFor b even, a+b = even + even = even.\\nAnd only one b even, say b0 even, then only for that b0, a+b0 is even for each a, so for a=2, 2+b0 even, for a=4, 4+b0 even, so two even numbers: 2+b0 and 4+b0, and gcd(2+b0,4+b0) = gcd(2+b0,2) , which is 1 or 2.\\nIf 2+b0 even, which it is, and 2 even, gcd at least 2, and since both even, gcd≥2>1, so not coprime.\\nOh! So even if only one b even, but for that b, both 2+b0 and 4+b0 are even, and their gcd is at least 2, since both even, so gcd≥2>1, not good.\\nTherefore, for a fixed b, if there are two a in A, then a1+b and a2+b may not be coprime.\\nIn this case, for b=b0 even, 2+b0 and 4+b0 are both even, gcd at least 2.\\nTo have gcd(2+b0,4+b0)=1, but both even, impossible.\\nSo unless for that b, only one a is used, but in A+B, both are included.\\nSo to avoid that, for the b that makes a+b even, there should be only one a in A, but A has at least two elements.\\nTherefore, it seems impossible to avoid having at least two even numbers or two numbers sharing a common factor.\\nPerhaps if A has only one element, but the problem requires at least two elements.\\nSo probably no such set exists.\\nTherefore, for Problem 2, the answer is no.\\n\\nSo summary:\\nProblem 1: f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x.\\nProblem 2: no.\\n\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"no\"\n}",
