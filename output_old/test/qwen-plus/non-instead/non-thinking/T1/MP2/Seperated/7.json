Four of these regions each have a central angle of $x^\\\\circ$, and the remaining two have central angles of $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nSince the total central angle in a circle is $360^\\\\circ$, we can write:\\n\\n$$\\n4x + 20 + 140 = 360\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n4x + 160 = 360\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n4x = 200 \\\\Rightarrow x = 50\\n$$\\n\\nSo each of the four equal regions has a central angle of $50^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nNow, we need to find the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region. However, the problem does not specify which regions are shaded. But since it's asking for *the* probability, and only gives sizes of regions, it implies that the shaded regions are defined by their size or count.\\n\\nBut wait — actually, rereading: it says “a circular spinner is divided into six regions” — four of size $x^\\\\circ$, one of $20^\\\\circ$, one of $140^\\\\circ$. We found $x = 50$. So the six regions have angles:\\n\\n- 50°, 50°, 50°, 50°, 20°, 140°\\n\\nSum: $4 \\\\times 50 = 200$, plus $20 + 140 = 160$, total $360^\\\\circ$: correct.\\n\\nBut the problem asks: \\\"What is the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region\\\" — but it doesn't say which ones are shaded! This seems ambiguous.\\n\\nWait — perhaps we missed something. Let's re-express: maybe the shaded region refers to the regions with non-$x$ angles? Or maybe the opposite?\\n\\nBut no specification is given. However, such problems usually imply that either the unusual regions are shaded, or perhaps all regions of a certain type.\\n\\nBut here's a key insight: perhaps the question is incomplete as stated? But no — let's look again.\\n\\nWait — perhaps the problem means that four regions are identical (each $x^\\\\circ$), and the other two are $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$, and we're to assume that the shaded regions are, say, the ones with angle $x^\\\\circ$? Or maybe not.\\n\\nBut without knowing which are shaded, we cannot compute probability.\\n\\nWait — unless the shaded region is implied by context. But there is none.\\n\\nAlternatively, could it be that \\\"shaded region\\\" refers to a diagram not shown? But in text-based problems like this, sometimes the shading is determined by size.\\n\\nWait — another possibility: maybe the problem meant to say that the four regions of size $x^\\\\circ$ are shaded? That would make sense.\\n\\nBut let's suppose instead that the problem is from a known type: often, when angles are given like this, and one asks for probability of landing on shaded region, and only sizes are given, then perhaps the shaded regions are the ones with specified distinct angles? But again, not clear.\\n\\nWait — perhaps I misread: the problem says \\\"four regions each have a central angle of $x^\\\\circ$\\\", and \\\"the remaining regions have central angles of $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$\\\" — so two remaining: one 20°, one 140°.\\n\\nBut still, which are shaded?\\n\\nHold on — perhaps the problem is implying that the shaded region is the union of the regions with angle $x^\\\\circ$? Or maybe the opposite?\\n\\nBut without explicit info, this seems impossible.\\n\\nWait — perhaps in the original context, the shaded regions are the ones that are not 20° and 140°, i.e., the four $x^\\\\circ$ ones? That would be natural if those were the standard ones.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the 140° region is shaded? But that’s arbitrary.\\n\\nBut let's think differently: maybe \\\"shaded region\\\" is a typo or misnomer, and we are just to find the probability based on area, but we need to know what is shaded.\\n\\nWait — perhaps the problem is from a source where diagrams are involved, but here it's text-only.\\n\\nBut let's look at the second problem — it's well-defined. Maybe the first one has an implicit assumption.\\n\\nAlternative interpretation: perhaps \\\"a shaded region\\\" means any region that is shaded, and we are to express the probability in terms of which regions are shaded, but no info.\\n\\nWait — unless the shaded regions are the ones with angle $x^\\\\circ$? That would make sense because there are four of them, and they are symmetric.\\n\\nLet me assume that the four regions of $x^\\\\circ = 50^\\\\circ$ are shaded. Then total shaded angle is $4 \\\\times 50 = 200^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nThen probability = $\\\\frac{200}{360} = \\\\frac{5}{9}$.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the shaded regions are the 20° and 140° ones, total = 160°, probability = $\\\\frac{160}{360} = \\\\frac{4}{9}$.\\n\\nBut which one?\\n\\nWait — 140° is large, maybe it's shaded? But no clue.\\n\\nBut note: 20° and 140° sum to 160°, and 4x = 200°, so majority.\\n\\nBut here's a different idea: perhaps \\\"shaded region\\\" refers to a single region, but the problem says \\\"a shaded region\\\", meaning any of the shaded ones.\\n\\nBut still ambiguous.\\n\\nWait — perhaps in the problem statement, it's implied that the regions with angle $x^\\\\circ$ are unshaded, and the other two are shaded? But why?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe only the 140° region is shaded? Then probability = 140/360 = 7/18.\\n\\nBut that seems arbitrary.\\n\\nWait — perhaps I need to consider that the problem might have a diagram where specific regions are shaded, but since it's not provided, maybe the intended answer is based on the four equal regions being shaded.\\n\\nBut let's try to search for similar problems.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps \\\"the shaded region\\\" refers to the region that is different — but there are two different ones.\\n\\nAnother thought: maybe \\\"shaded\\\" is not specified because it's a trick, and we need to realize that without knowing which are shaded, we can't solve — but that can't be, since it's asked.\\n\\nWait — perhaps the problem meant to say that the regions of size $x^\\\\circ$ are shaded? That would be the most logical assumption, as they are the repeated ones.\\n\\nMoreover, in many such problems, the identical regions are shaded.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the non-x regions are shaded.\\n\\nBut let's calculate both:\\n\\n- If the four $x=50^\\\\circ$ regions are shaded: total angle = 200° → probability = 200/360 = 5/9 ≈ 0.555...\\n\\n- If the two non-x regions (20° and 140°) are shaded: total = 160° → 160/360 = 4/9\\n\\n- If only the 140° region is shaded: 140/360 = 7/18\\n\\nBut 5/9 and 4/9 are simple fractions.\\n\\nBut notice: 20° and 140° sum to 160°, which is less than half? No, 160 < 180, so less than half. 200 > 180.\\n\\nBut no clue.\\n\\nWait — perhaps the problem is from a source where the shaded regions are the ones with angle not equal to x, i.e., the 20° and 140° ones.\\n\\nBut let's look at the second problem — it's number theory. First problem is geometry/probability.\\n\\nPerhaps I missed that the problem says \\\"a shaded region\\\" but doesn't define it, which is odd.\\n\\nWait — re-reading: \\\"What is the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region if a circular spinner is divided into six regions...\\\"\\n\\nIt doesn't say which are shaded. This must be an omission.\\n\\nBut in many such problems, the shaded regions are the ones that are mentioned as having specific values, or the ones that are different.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps \\\"shaded\\\" refers to the regions with central angle x°, as they are the main ones.\\n\\nBut let's try to see if there's another way.\\n\\nWait — perhaps the problem is that the four regions of x° are unshaded, and the 20° and 140° are shaded? But why?\\n\\nAnother idea: maybe \\\"shaded region\\\" is singular, implying only one region is shaded? But it says \\\"a shaded region\\\", which could mean any of the shaded regions.\\n\\nIn English, \\\"a shaded region\\\" means one of the regions that is shaded.\\n\\nBut we need to know how much total area is shaded.\\n\\nWithout additional information, this is impossible.\\n\\nBut perhaps in the context of the problem, it's implied that the regions with angle x° are shaded. Since there are four of them, and they are identical, that makes sense.\\n\\nMoreover, solving for x was necessary, and then using that to find total shaded area.\\n\\nSo likely, the shaded regions are the four of size x° = 50° each.\\n\\nTotal shaded angle: 4 × 50 = 200°\\n\\nProbability = 200 / 360 = 5/9\\n\\nSo I'll go with 5/9.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe are told that a pair (m, n) is a happy pair if gcd(m, n) is a perfect square.\\n\\nGiven: (205800, 35k) is a happy pair, and k is a positive integer with k ≤ 2940.\\n\\nWe need to find the number of possible values of k satisfying this.\\n\\nFirst, factorize the numbers.\\n\\nStart with 205800.\\n\\n205800 = 2058 × 100\\n\\n100 = 2^2 × 5^2\\n\\n2058: divide by 2: 1029\\n\\n1029: divisible by 3? 1+0+2+9=12, yes. 1029 ÷ 3 = 343\\n\\n343 = 7^3\\n\\nSo 1029 = 3 × 7^3\\n\\nThus 2058 = 2 × 3 × 7^3\\n\\nSo 205800 = 2 × 3 × 7^3 × 2^2 × 5^2 = 2^{3} × 3^1 × 5^2 × 7^3\\n\\nCheck:\\n2^3 = 8\\n3 = 3\\n5^2 = 25\\n7^3 = 343\\n\\n8 × 3 = 24\\n24 × 25 = 600\\n600 × 343\\n\\n600 × 300 = 180,000\\n600 × 43 = 25,800\\nTotal = 205,800 → correct.\\n\\nSo 205800 = 2^3 × 3^1 × 5^2 × 7^3\\n\\nNow, 35k = 5 × 7 × k\\n\\nSo n = 35k = 5 × 7 × k\\n\\nWe need gcd(205800, 35k) to be a perfect square.\\n\\nLet d = gcd(205800, 35k)\\n\\nSince d divides 205800, d must be of the form:\\n\\n2^a × 3^b × 5^c × 7^d\\n\\nwith 0 ≤ a ≤ 3, 0 ≤ b ≤ 1, 0 ≤ c ≤ 2, 0 ≤ d ≤ 3\\n\\nAlso, d divides 35k = 5 × 7 × k, so d must divide 5 × 7 × k.\\n\\nBut k is variable, so the prime factors of d can only come from primes in 205800 and in 35k.\\n\\nBut 35k introduces primes from k, but d must divide 205800, so d can only have primes 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nMoreover, since d divides 35k = 5 × 7 × k, the exponents in d must satisfy:\\n\\n- For prime 2: a must be ≤ exponent in k, but k may have 2 or not. Actually, d divides 35k, and 35k has prime factors from k and 5,7.\\n\\nSpecifically:\\n\\n- The exponent of 2 in d must be ≤ exponent of 2 in k (since 35 has no factor of 2)\\n- Similarly, exponent of 3 in d must be ≤ exponent of 3 in k\\n- Exponent of 5 in d must be ≤ 1 + exponent of 5 in k (since 35 provides 5^1)\\n- Exponent of 7 in d must be ≤ 1 + exponent of 7 in k\\n\\nBut also, d = gcd(205800, 35k), so:\\n\\nFor each prime, the exponent in d is the minimum of the exponents in 205800 and in 35k.\\n\\nSo let’s do it prime by prime.\\n\\nLet k have prime factorization including primes 2,3,5,7, and possibly others, but since gcd only cares about common primes, and 205800 has only 2,3,5,7, the gcd will only involve these primes.\\n\\nSo let:\\n\\nk = 2^{a_k} × 3^{b_k} × 5^{c_k} × 7^{d_k} × m, where m is coprime to 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nThen 35k = 5 × 7 × k = 2^{a_k} × 3^{b_k} × 5^{c_k + 1} × 7^{d_k + 1} × m\\n\\nNow, 205800 = 2^3 × 3^1 × 5^2 × 7^3\\n\\nSo gcd(205800, 35k) = 2^{min(3, a_k)} × 3^{min(1, b_k)} × 5^{min(2, c_k + 1)} × 7^{min(3, d_k + 1)}\\n\\nWe need this gcd to be a perfect square.\\n\\nA number is a perfect square iff all exponents in its prime factorization are even.\\n\\nSo we need:\\n\\n- min(3, a_k) is even\\n- min(1, b_k) is even\\n- min(2, c_k + 1) is even\\n- min(3, d_k + 1) is even\\n\\nNow, analyze each condition.\\n\\n1. min(3, a_k) is even.\\n\\nmin(3, a_k) can be 0,1,2,3.\\nEven values: 0 or 2.\\n\\n- If min(3, a_k) = 0 → a_k = 0 (since min(3,0)=0)\\n- If min(3, a_k) = 2 → a_k ≥ 2, and min is 2, so a_k ≥ 2, but min(3,a_k)=2 implies a_k = 2 (if a_k=3, min=3, odd; if a_k>3, min=3, odd)\\n\\nmin(3,a_k) = 2 iff a_k = 2 (because if a_k=2, min=2; if a_k≥3, min=3; if a_k<2, min=a_k<2)\\n\\nSo min(3,a_k) is even iff min(3,a_k) = 0 or 2.\\n\\n- min=0: a_k = 0\\n- min=2: a_k = 2\\n\\nIf a_k = 1, min=1, odd → not allowed\\nIf a_k ≥ 3, min=3, odd → not allowed\\n\\nSo a_k must be 0 or 2.\\n\\n2. min(1, b_k) is even.\\n\\nmin(1, b_k) can be 0 or 1.\\nEven only if 0.\\n\\nmin(1,b_k)=0 iff b_k = 0 (since if b_k ≥1, min=1, odd; if b_k=0, min=0, even)\\n\\nSo b_k must be 0.\\n\\n3. min(2, c_k + 1) is even.\\n\\nmin(2, c_k + 1) can be 0,1,2.\\nEven if 0 or 2.\\n\\n- min=0: c_k + 1 = 0? But c_k ≥0, so c_k +1 ≥1, so min ≥1, cannot be 0.\\n- So min=0 impossible.\\n- min=2: even → allowed\\n- min=1: odd → not allowed\\n\\nSo we need min(2, c_k + 1) = 2\\n\\nWhich means c_k + 1 ≥ 2 and min is 2, so c_k + 1 ≥ 2 ⇒ c_k ≥ 1\\nAnd min(2, c_k + 1) = 2 ⇒ since it's min, we need c_k + 1 ≥ 2, which is already covered, and the min is 2, which happens when c_k + 1 ≥ 2, but actually min(2, x) = 2 iff x ≥ 2\\nBecause if x < 2, min=x; if x ≥ 2, min=2.\\n\\nSo min(2, c_k + 1) = 2 iff c_k + 1 ≥ 2 iff c_k ≥ 1\\n\\nAnd we need this min to be 2, which is even, good.\\n\\nBut is there a case where min=0? No, as above.\\n\\nCould min be 1? Yes, if c_k + 1 = 1, i.e., c_k = 0, then min(2,1)=1, odd → not allowed.\\n\\nSo only allowed when min=2, i.e., c_k ≥ 1\\n\\nSo c_k ≥ 1\\n\\n4. min(3, d_k + 1) is even.\\n\\nmin(3, d_k + 1) can be 0,1,2,3.\\nEven if 0,2.\\n\\nBut d_k ≥0, so d_k +1 ≥1, so min ≥1, so min=0 impossible.\\n\\nSo need min=2 (since 0 impossible, 1 and 3 odd, 2 even)\\n\\nSo min(3, d_k + 1) = 2\\n\\nThis happens when d_k + 1 ≥ 2 and min is 2, so d_k + 1 ≥ 2 ⇒ d_k ≥ 1\\nAnd min(3, d_k + 1) = 2 iff d_k + 1 = 2? No.\\n\\nmin(3,x) = 2 iff x = 2, because:\\n- if x < 3, min=x, so min=2 iff x=2\\n- if x ≥ 3, min=3\\n\\nSo min(3, d_k + 1) = 2 iff d_k + 1 = 2 iff d_k = 1\\n\\nIf d_k + 1 = 3, min=3, odd\\nIf d_k + 1 = 4, min=3, odd\\nOnly when d_k + 1 = 2, min=2, even.\\n\\nSo d_k must be 1.\\n\\nSummary of conditions on k's exponents:\\n\\n- a_k = 0 or 2  (exponent of 2)\\n- b_k = 0        (exponent of 3)\\n- c_k ≥ 1        (exponent of 5)\\n- d_k = 1        (exponent of 7)\\n\\nAdditionally, k can have other prime factors, but since they don't affect the gcd (as 205800 has no other primes), and the gcd condition is already satisfied as long as the exponents for 2,3,5,7 are as above, because the gcd only depends on these primes.\\n\\nSo k must be of the form:\\n\\nk = 2^{a_k} × 3^{0} × 5^{c_k} × 7^{1} × m = 2^{a_k} × 5^{c_k} × 7 × m\\n\\nwhere:\\n- a_k = 0 or 2\\n- c_k ≥ 1\\n- m is a positive integer coprime to 2,3,5,7 (i.e., not divisible by 2,3,5,7)\\n\\nBut k ≤ 2940\\n\\nWe need to count the number of such k ≤ 2940.\\n\\nNote that m can include primes greater than 7, or powers, as long as not divisible by 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nBut k = 2^{a_k} × 5^{c_k} × 7 × m, with m coprime to 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nTo avoid double-counting, we can fix the exponents and sum over possibilities.\\n\\nSince a_k has two choices (0 or 2), and c_k ≥1, and m is coprime to 2,3,5,7, but m multiplies, we need to ensure k ≤ 2940.\\n\\nBetter to iterate over possible values.\\n\\nFirst, compute the minimal k for each choice.\\n\\nLet’s denote the fixed part.\\n\\nSet s = 2^{a_k} × 5^{c_k} × 7\\n\\nThen k = s × m, with m coprime to 2,3,5,7, and k ≤ 2940, so m ≤ floor(2940 / s)\\n\\nAnd m ≥1, integer.\\n\\nBut m must be coprime to 2,3,5,7, i.e., gcd(m, 210) = 1, since 2×3×5×7=210.\\n\\nNow, a_k = 0 or 2\\n\\nc_k ≥1\\n\\ns = 2^{a_k} × 5^{c_k} × 7\\n\\nWe need to consider all combinations of a_k and c_k, compute s, then for each s, the maximum m is floor(2940 / s), and we need the number of integers m from 1 to floor(2940/s) that are coprime to 210.\\n\\nBut note that m=1 is allowed.\\n\\nNow, list possible c_k starting from 1 upwards, but s increases, so bounded.\\n\\nFirst, fix a_k.\\n\\nCase 1: a_k = 0\\nThen s = 2^0 × 5^{c_k} × 7 = 1 × 5^{c_k} × 7 = 7 × 5^{c_k}\\n\\nc_k ≥1\\n\\ns = 7 × 5^{c_k}\\n\\nk = s × m = 7 × 5^{c_k} × m, with gcd(m,210)=1, and k ≤ 2940\\n\\nSo 7 × 5^{c_k} × m ≤ 2940 ⇒ m ≤ 2940 / (7 × 5^{c_k}) = 420 / 5^{c_k}\\n\\nNow, c_k ≥1\\n\\nTry c_k =1: s = 7×5 = 35, m ≤ 2940 / 35 = 84\\nNumber of m from 1 to 84 coprime to 210.\\n\\nBut gcd(m,210)=1, and 210=2×3×5×7\\n\\nSo m coprime to 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nUse inclusion-exclusion or Euler's totient, but since range is small, we can compute the count.\\n\\nThe number of integers from 1 to N coprime to M is sum over d|M μ(d) floor(N/d)\\n\\nHere M=210, N=84\\n\\nFirst, factorize 210=2×3×5×7\\n\\nμ(d) for divisors:\\n\\nList divisors of 210: 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14,15,21,30,35,42,70,105,210\\n\\nμ(1)=1\\nμ(2)= -1\\nμ(3)= -1\\nμ(5)= -1\\nμ(6)= μ(2×3)= +1\\nμ(7)= -1\\nμ(10)= μ(2×5)= +1\\nμ(14)= μ(2×7)= +1\\nμ(15)= μ(3×5)= +1\\nμ(21)= μ(3×7)= +1\\nμ(30)= μ(2×3×5)= -1\\nμ(35)= μ(5×7)= +1\\nμ(42)= μ(2×3×7)= -1\\nμ(70)= μ(2×5×7)= -1\\nμ(105)= μ(3×5×7)= -1\\nμ(210)= μ(2×3×5×7)= +1\\n\\nNow, sum μ(d) floor(N/d) for d|210\\n\\nN=84\\n\\nfloor(84/d):\\n\\nd=1: floor(84/1)=84, μ=1 → +84\\n\\nd=2: 84/2=42, μ=-1 → -42\\n\\nd=3: 84/3=28, μ=-1 → -28\\n\\nd=5: 84/5=16.8→16, μ=-1 → -16\\n\\nd=6: 84/6=14, μ=+1 → +14\\n\\nd=7: 84/7=12, μ=-1 → -12\\n\\nd=10: 84/10=8.4→8, μ=+1 → +8\\n\\nd=14: 84/14=6, μ=+1 → +6\\n\\nd=15: 84/15=5.6→5, μ=+1 → +5\\n\\nd=21: 84/21=4, μ=+1 → +4\\n\\nd=30: 84/30=2.8→2, μ=-1 → -2\\n\\nd=35: 84/35=2.4→2, μ=+1 → +2\\n\\nd=42: 84/42=2, μ=-1 → -2\\n\\nd=70: 84/70=1.2→1, μ=-1 → -1\\n\\nd=105: 84/105<1→0, μ=-1 → 0\\n\\nd=210: 84/210<1→0, μ=+1 → 0\\n\\nNow sum:\\nStart: 84\\n-42 = 42\\n-28 = 14\\n-16 = -2\\n+14 = 12\\n-12 = 0\\n+8 = 8\\n+6 = 14\\n+5 = 19\\n+4 = 23\\n-2 = 21\\n+2 = 23\\n-2 = 21\\n-1 = 20\\n+0+0=20\\n\\nSo 20 values.\\n\\nI am considering recalculating:\\n\\nList: +84, -42, -28, -16, +14, -12, +8, +6, +5, +4, -2, +2, -2, -1\\n\\nGroup positives: 84 +14 +8 +6 +5 +4 +2 = 84+14=98, +8=106, +6=112, +5=117, +4=121, +2=123\\nNegatives: -42 -28 -16 -12 -2 -2 -1 = -42-28=-70, -16=-86, -12=-98, -2=-100, -2=-102, -1=-103\\n\\nTotal: 123 - 103 = 20 → yes.\\n\\nSo for c_k=1, a_k=0, number of m is 20.\\n\\nNow c_k=2: s=7×25=175, m ≤ 2940 / 175 = ?\\n2940 ÷ 175: 175×16=2800, 2940-2800=140, so 16.8, so floor=16\\nm ≤ 16\\nNumber of m from 1 to 16 coprime to 210, i.e., not divisible by 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nList: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16\\nRemove multiples of 2,3,5,7.\\nCoprime to 210: not divisible by 2,3,5,7.\\nSo odd, not multiple of 3,5,7.\\n1: yes\\n2: even, no\\n3: div by 3, no\\n4: even, no\\n5: div by 5, no\\n6: even, no\\n7: div by 7, no\\n8: even, no\\n9: div by 3, no\\n10: even, no\\n11: not div by 2,3,5,7?

But m must be coprime to 210, m=2 is even, gcd=2≠1, not allowed, and in our count, for c_k=3, m≤3, but only m=1 is coprime, so k=875\\nSimilarly, for a_k=2, c_k=2: s=28×25=700, m=1, k=700\\nNow, is there a constraint I missed?\\nIn the gcd, we assumed that the exponents are exactly as set, but when we set m, it doesn't introduce new common primes, so gcd is determined solely by the 2,3,5,7 parts, which we controlled.\\nAlso, for prime 3, we set b_k=0, so no factor of 3 in k, so min(1,b_k)=min(1,0)=0, even, good.\\nAnd m coprime to 3, so no issue.\\nNow, total 30.\\nBut let me confirm the counts.\\nFirst, a_k=0:\\n- c_k=1: s=35, m≤84, number coprime to 210: we calculated 20\\n- c_k=2: s=175, m≤16, number:3\\n- c_k=3: s=875, m≤3, number:1 (only m=1)\\nTotal 24\\na_k=2:\\n- c_k=1: s=140, m≤21, number:5\\n- c_k=2: s=700, m≤4, number:1 (m=1)\\nTotal 6\\nSum 30\\nBut is m=1 always allowed? Yes.\\nNow, k must be positive integer, which it is.\\nAnd k≤2940: for largest k, say a_k=0,c_k=1,m=84? But m=84, is it coprime to 210?\\ngcd(84,210): 84=2^2×3×7, 210=2×3×5×7, gcd=2×3×7=42≠1, so not included. Our calculation excluded it.\\nThe largest m in that case is, say, m=83? But 83 is prime, greater than 7, so gcd(83,210)=1, yes, and 83≤84, so included.\\nk=35×83=2905≤2940, yes.\\nSimilarly, for a_k=0,c_k=3,m=1,k=875\\nFor a_k=2,c_k=1,m=21? m=21=3×7, gcd(21,210)=21≠1, not included. Largest m=19, k=140×19=2660≤2940\\nAll good.\\nSo total 30 possible k.\\nBut the problem asks for the number of possible values of k with k≤2940.\\nSo answer should be 30.\\nBut let me double-check the inclusion-exclusion for the first one.\\nFor a_k=0,c_k=1: N=84, coprime to 210.\\nWe can compute φ(210)/210 * N approximately, but better to trust calculation.\\nThe number of integers up to 84 coprime to 210.\\nSince 210=2×3×5×7, the density is φ(210)/210 = (1-1/2)(1-1/3)(1-1/5)(1-1/7) = (1/2)(2/3)(4/5)(6/7) = (1/2)(2/3)=1/3, times 4/5=4/15, times 6/7=24/105=8/35\\nφ(210)=φ(2)φ(3)φ(5)φ(7)=1×2×4×6=48? Wait no\\nφ is multiplicative, but for prime p, φ(p)=p-1\\nφ(210)=210 × (1-1/2)(1-1/3)(1-1/5)(1-1/7)=210 × 1/2 × 2/3 × 4/5 × 6/7\\nCompute: 210 × 1/2 = 105\\n105 × 2/3 = 70\\n70 × 4/5 = 56\\n56 × 6/7 = 48\\nYes, φ(210)=48\\nSo density 48/210=16/70=8/35≈0.2286\\n84 × 8/35 = (84/35)×8 = 2.4×8=19.2, so around 19 or 20, we have 20, reasonable.\\nSimilarly for others.\\nSo total 30.\\nBut in the beginning, for problem 1, I assumed the four x-degree regions are shaded.\\nBut let me reconsider: total angle 360, x=50, so four regions: 200°, two others: 20+140=160°\\nIf shaded are the four, prob=200/360=5/9\\nBut perhaps shaded are the two non-x regions? Then 160/360=4/9\\nOr only the 140° one? 140/360=7/18\\nBut 5/9 is simplest.\\nPerhaps the problem intends that the regions of size x are unshaded, and the others are shaded.\\nBut in many problems, the identical regions are shaded.\\nAnother thought: perhaps \\\"shaded region\\\" refers to the region that is shaded in a diagram, but since not specified, maybe it's the 140° one as it's large.\\nBut that seems unlikely.\\nPerhaps the problem is that two regions are shaded: the 20° and 140°, but why?\\nNotice that 20 and 140 sum to 160, while 4x=200.\\nBut no.\\nPerhaps the shaded region is the one with 140°, as it's mentioned separately.\\nBut I think 5/9 is more plausible.\\nPerhaps I can look at the answer.\\nAnother idea: perhaps \\\"a shaded region\\\" means any region that is shaded, and in the context, all regions of size x are shaded, as they are the majority.\\nMoreover, 5/9 is a nice fraction.\\nPerhaps the problem states that the four regions are shaded, but in text it's omitted.\\nGiven that, and since the second problem gave 30, which is integer, probably first is 5/9.\\nSo I'll go with that.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5/9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"30\"\n}",
