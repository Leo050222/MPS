  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Let $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game. What is the probability that exactly $k$ games will need to be played to determine a winner?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-part problem. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell\n\nWe are told:\n\n- A **2-configuration** involves pairs.\n- A **consistent 2-configuration** of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair.\n- The pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of the set $ A $.\n- Since it has exactly **one cell**, and each cell is a pair (as it's a 2-configuration), this means the entire set $ A $ is partitioned into **one pair**.\n\nTherefore, the set $ A $ must have exactly **2 elements**, because one pair = 2 elements.\n\nSo:\n$$\nn = |A| = 2\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Compute $ k = n + 5 $\n\nGiven $ n = 2 $,\n$$\nk = 2 + 5 = 7\n$$\n\nSo $ k = 7 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Best-of-9 series — first to win 5 games wins\n\nWe are to find the probability that **exactly $ k = 7 $** games are played to determine a winner.\n\nNote: Although it's a best-of-9 series (maximum 9 games), the series ends when one team reaches 5 wins.\n\nSo, for **exactly 7 games** to be played, the series must end on the 7th game, meaning that after 6 games, one team has exactly 4 wins and the other has 2 wins, and then the team with 4 wins wins the 7th game.\n\nWait — let's double-check: total wins needed = 5.\n\nAfter 6 games, the possible win counts are:\n\nTo finish on game 7, no team can have already won 5 games before game 7. So after 6 games, the maximum wins a team can have is 4.\n\nAnd since the series hasn't ended yet, both teams must have fewer than 5 wins.\n\nBut total games = 6 ⇒ sum of wins = 6.\n\nSo for the series to go to game 7, one team must have 4 wins, the other 2 wins.\n\nThen, in game 7, the team with 4 wins must win to reach 5.\n\nSo two scenarios:\n\n1. Mathletes win 4 of first 6, then win game 7.\n2. Opponent wins 4 of first 6, then wins game 7.\n\nBut we are only asked for the **probability that exactly 7 games are played** — regardless of who wins.\n\nSo we compute the total probability that the series lasts exactly 7 games.\n\nLet’s define:\n\n- Probability Mathletes win a game: $ p = \\frac{2}{3} $\n- Probability opponent wins a game: $ q = 1 - p = \\frac{1}{3} $\n\nNow, number of ways the Mathletes can win exactly 4 of the first 6 games: $ \\binom{6}{4} $\n\nIn those cases, they win the 7th game to win the series.\n\nSimilarly, number of ways the opponent can win exactly 4 of the first 6 games: $ \\binom{6}{4} $? Wait — if opponent has 4 wins, that means Mathletes have 2 wins.\n\nSo number of such sequences: $ \\binom{6}{2} $ or $ \\binom{6}{4} $ — same thing.\n\nSo:\n\nTotal probability that the series ends in exactly 7 games:\n\n$$\nP = \\underbrace{\\binom{6}{4} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2}_{\\text{Mathletes have 4 wins after 6}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} + \\underbrace{\\binom{6}{4} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^4 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2}_{\\text{Opponent has 4 wins after 6}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\nWait — correction: If the opponent has 4 wins, then Mathletes have 2 wins. So the probability of that sequence is:\n\n$$\n\\binom{6}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^4\n$$\n\nBut $ \\binom{6}{2} = \\binom{6}{4} = 15 $\n\nSo let's compute both terms.\n\nFirst term: Mathletes win series in 7 games.\n\nThey win 4 of first 6, lose 2, then win game 7:\n\n$$\nP_1 = \\binom{6}{4} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = 15 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{16}{81}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\n\nWait — better to combine exponents.\n\n$ \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 = \\frac{16}{81} $\n\n$ \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{9}{81} $? No, better common denominator later.\n\nActually:\n\n$$\nP_1 = \\binom{6}{4} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2\n$$\n\nBecause they win 5 games (4 in first 6, one in game 7), lose 2.\n\nSimilarly, for opponent winning in 7 games: they win 4 of first 6, win game 7 ⇒ opponent wins 5, Mathletes win 2.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nP_2 = \\binom{6}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^5\n$$\n\nBecause Mathletes win 2 games, opponent wins 5.\n\nNote: $ \\binom{6}{4} = \\binom{6}{2} = 15 $\n\nSo:\n\nCompute $ P = P_1 + P_2 $\n\n$$\nP_1 = 15 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = 15 \\cdot \\frac{32}{243} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} = 15 \\cdot \\frac{32}{2187}\n$$\n\nWait: $ 3^7 = 2187 $? Yes, since $ 3^5 = 243 $, $ 3^6 = 729 $, $ 3^7 = 2187 $\n\nNow $ \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5 = \\frac{32}{243} $, $ \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9} $, so product: $ \\frac{32}{243 \\cdot 9} = \\frac{32}{2187} $\n\nThen times 15: $ P_1 = 15 \\cdot \\frac{32}{2187} = \\frac{480}{2187} $\n\nNow $ P_2 = 15 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^5 = 15 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{243} = 15 \\cdot \\frac{4}{2187} = \\frac{60}{2187} $\n\nSo total:\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{480 + 60}{2187} = \\frac{540}{2187}\n$$\n\nNow simplify $ \\frac{540}{2187} $\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 9:\n\n540 ÷ 9 = 60  \n2187 ÷ 9 = 243\n\nSo $ \\frac{60}{243} $\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n60 ÷ 3 = 20  \n243 ÷ 3 = 81\n\nSo $ \\frac{20}{81} $\n\nThus, the probability that exactly 7 games are played is $ \\frac{20}{81} $\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"20/81\"\n}",
