However, we need a_{100}. Computing all terms manually is impractical.\\n\\nBut observe: once a prime p appears as a_{k}, then as long as the sum S_{k-1} + multiple copies of p has largest prime factor p, then p will keep being added.\\n\\nBut more importantly, let's look at the sum growth.\\n\\nActually, from the recurrence:\\na_{n+1} = largest prime divisor of S_n\\nand S_{n} = S_{n-1} + a_n\\n\\nBut note that a_{n+1} divides S_n, because it's a prime divisor of it.\\nAlso, S_{n} = S_{n-1} + a_n\\n\\nBut more crucially, once a prime p becomes the value of a_k, and if S_{k-1} ≡ 0 mod p? Not necessarily.\\n\\nBut here’s a key observation: suppose that at some point, the sum S_n is divisible only by small primes, but a_{n+1} is the largest prime divisor.\\n\\nHowever, there is a known problem similar to this: in fact, this sequence is known to eventually become constant?\\nWait — no, it keeps increasing.\\n\\nBut let’s check more carefully.\\n\\nWait: actually, after a while, the sum grows, and the largest prime divisor increases slowly.\\n\\nBut is there a cycle or stabilization?\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence eventually becomes periodic or hits a fixed behavior.\\n\\nBut looking at OEIS or known sequences: this resembles the “EKG sequence” but it's not.\\n\\nAlternatively, let’s suppose that after a certain point, the sum S_n is always divisible by a large prime, but we add that prime repeatedly.\\n\\nBut notice: when we start adding a new prime p, it gets added until the sum accumulates multiples of p and possibly introduces a larger prime factor.\\n\\nBut here's an important insight: once a prime p is introduced as a_{k}, then subsequent a_i = p for several i, until S_n has a prime factor larger than p.\\n\\nBut how does a larger prime appear? Only if S_n has a prime factor > p.\\n\\nBut S_n includes previous terms, many of which are smaller primes.\\n\\nBut empirically, the primes increase: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,...\\n\\nFrom earlier:\\n- a_2 = 2\\n- a_3 = 3\\n- a_7 = 5\\n- a_11 = 7\\n- a_17 = 11\\n- a_23 = 13\\n- a_29 = 17\\n\\nPositions where new prime starts:\\n- 3: prime 3\\n- 7: prime 5\\n- 11: prime 7\\n- 17: prime 11\\n- 23: prime 13\\n- 29: prime 17\\n\\nLook at the indices: 3,7,11,17,23,29\\nDifferences: 7-3=4, 11-7=4, 17-11=6, 23-17=6, 29-23=6\\nNot clear.\\n\\nList the starting index of each new prime:\\n- 2: index 2\\n- 3: index 3\\n- 5: index 7\\n- 7: index 11\\n- 11: index 17\\n- 13: index 23\\n- 17: index 29\\n\\nNow look at the gaps between starting indices:\\n3→7: gap 4\\n7→11: gap 4\\n11→17: gap 6\\n17→23: gap 6\\n23→29: gap 6\\nIf next gap is 6? Then 29+6=35 → prime 19?\\nBut 17 to 19 is next prime.\\n\\nCheck:\\na_{29} = 17\\nS_{28} = 221 (from earlier)\\nThen a_{29} = 17 → S_{29} = 221 + 17 = 238\\na_{30} = lpd(238) = lpd(2×7×17) = 17\\nS_{30} = 238+17=255 → lpd(255)=17? 255=3×5×17 → yes\\nS_{31}=255+17=272 → 272=16×17 → lpd=17\\nS_{32}=272+17=289 → 289=17^2 → lpd=17\\nS_{33}=289+17=306 → 306=2×3^2×17 → lpd=17\\nS_{34}=306+17=323 → 323=17×19 → lpd=19 → so a_{35}=19\\nYes! So new prime 19 starts at index 35.\\n\\nSimilarly, next:\\nS_{35}=323+19=342 → 342=2×3^2×19 → lpd=19\\nS_{36}=342+19=361=19^2 → lpd=19\\nS_{37}=361+19=380=2^2×5×19 → lpd=19\\nS_{38}=380+19=399=3×7×19 → lpd=19\\nS_{39}=399+19=418=2×11×19 → lpd=19\\nS_{40}=418+19=437 → 437 ÷ 19 = 23 → 19×23 → lpd=23 → a_{41}=23\\n\\nSo new prime 23 at index 41.\\n\\nSequence of starting indices for new primes:\\n2:2, 3:3, 5:7, 7:11, 11:17, 13:23, 17:29, 19:35, 23:41\\n\\nNow list the indices: 2,3,7,11,17,23,29,35,41\\nDifferences: 1,4,4,6,6,6,6,6\\nAfter the first few, the gap is 6.\\nFrom 11 onward: 11,17,23,29,35,41 → arithmetic sequence with difference 6.\\n\\nWhy 6? Because each prime p is repeated exactly 6 times?\\nLet’s check:\\n- 5: started at 7, next prime 7 at 11 → so 7,8,9,10 → 4 terms? a_7 to a_{10} → 4 terms\\n- 7: a_{11} to a_{16}? a_{17} is 11 → so a_{11} to a_{16} → 6 terms\\n- 11: a_{17} to a_{22} → 6 terms (17,18,19,20,21,22)\\n- 13: a_{23} to a_{28} → 6 terms\\n- 17: a_{29} to a_{34} → 6 terms\\n- 19: a_{35} to a_{40} → 6 terms\\n- 23: a_{41} → next should be at 47?\\n\\nSo starting from prime 7 (index 11), each prime is used for exactly 6 terms.\\n\\nBut 5 was only 4 terms (a_7 to a_{10}), 3: a_3 to a_6? a_3=3, a_4=3, a_5=3, a_6=3 → that's 4 terms, then a_7=5\\na_2=2 → only one term? a_2=2, a_3=3 → so 2 appears once.\\n\\nSo summary:\\n- a_1 = 1 (special)\\n- a_2 = 2 → 1 term\\n- a_3 to a_6 = 3 → 4 terms\\n- a_7 to a_{10} = 5 → 4 terms\\n- a_{11} to a_{16} = 7 → 6 terms\\n- a_{17} to a_{22} = 11 → 6 terms\\n- a_{23} to a_{28} = 13 → 6 terms\\n- a_{29} to a_{34} = 17 → 6 terms\\n- a_{35} to a_{40} = 19 → 6 terms\\n- a_{41} to a_{46} = 23 → 6 terms\\n- a_{47} to a_{52} = ?\\n\\nNext: after a_{41}=23, we had S_{40}=437, a_{41}=23 → S_{41}=437+23=460\\nlpd(460)=23? 460=2^2×5×23 → yes\\nS_{42}=460+23=483 → 483÷3=161, 161=7×23 → so 3×7×23 → lpd=23\\nS_{43}=483+23=506=2×11×23 → lpd=23\\nS_{44}=506+23=529=23^2 → lpd=23\\nS_{45}=529+23=552=2^3×3×23 → lpd=23\\nS_{46}=552+23=575=25×23 → 5^2×23 → lpd=23\\nS_{47}=575+23=598=2×13×23 → lpd=23? 13<23, so lpd=23? No, 23 is present → lpd=23\\nStill 23? But we expected change at a_{47}\\nS_{47}=598 → a_{48}=lpd(598)=23? 598=2×13×23 → yes, max is 23\\nS_{48}=598+23=621 → 621 ÷ 3 = 207, ÷3=69, ÷3=23 → 3^3×23 → lpd=23\\nS_{49}=621+23=644=2^2×7×23 → lpd=23\\nS_{50}=644+23=667 → 667 ÷ 23 = 29 → 23×29 → so lpd=29 → a_{51}=29\\nAh! So a_{51}=29, not a_{47}\\nSo the run of 23 is from a_{41} to a_{50} → 10 terms? That breaks the 6-term pattern.\\nWait, what happened?\\nEarlier primes had 6 terms, but 23 has more?\\nCount: a_{41} to a_{50} → 10 terms.\\nBut earlier we thought 6, but clearly not.\\nAlternative idea: perhaps the number of times a prime p appears is related to the sum.\\nBut maybe the pattern is not fixed length.\\nBut earlier from 7 onward we had 6 terms each? Let's verify 7:\\na_{11}=7 (after S_{10}=35, lpd=7)\\nS_{11}=35+7=42 → a_{12}=lpd(42)=7\\nS_{12}=42+7=49 → a_{13}=7\\nS_{13}=49+7=56 → a_{14}=7\\nS_{14}=56+7=63 → a_{15}=7\\nS_{15}=63+7=70 → a_{16}=7\\nS_{16}=70+7=77 → a_{17}=lpd(77)=11 → so a_{11} to a_{16} → 6 terms, yes.\\n11: a_{17} to a_{22} → S_{22}=143, a_{23}=13 → yes, 6 terms.\\n13: a_{23} to a_{28}: S_{28}=221, a_{29}=17 → 6 terms.\\n17: a_{29} to a_{34}: S_{34}=323, a_{35}=19 → 6 terms.\\n19: a_{35} to a_{40}: S_{40}=437, a_{41}=23 → 6 terms.\\nBut 23: a_{41}=23, and S_{41}=460 → a_{42}=23\\n... up to a_{50}=23, then a_{51}=29\\nSo a_{41} to a_{50} is 10 terms, not 6.\\nContradiction.\\nBut S_{40}=437, a_{41}=23 → S_{41}=460\\na_{42}=lpd(460)=23 (since 460=20*23)\\nS_{42}=483 → 483/23=21, so 21*23=483 → yes\\nS_{43}=506=22*23\\nS_{44}=529=23*23\\nS_{45}=552=24*23\\nS_{46}=575=25*23\\nS_{47}=598=26*23\\nS_{48}=621=27*23\\nS_{49}=644=28*23\\nS_{50}=667=29*23 → and 29 is prime, so lpd(667)=29 → a_{51}=29\\nSo indeed, 23 is used for 10 terms: n=41 to 50 inclusive → 10 terms.\\nBut why? Previously it was 6.\\nWhat's special about 23?\\nPerhaps the number of times a prime p is used is equal to the number of integers k such that the sum reaches a multiple of p times the next prime?\\nNotice that when the sum S_n = m * p, and if m has a prime factor > p, then a_{n+1} = that larger prime.\\nIn this case, for p=23, S_{40}=437 = 19*23, and 19<23, so lpd=23, so we continue.\\nS_{41}=460=20*23, 20=2^2*5, lpd=5<23 → so a_{42}=23\\nS_{42}=483=21*23, 21=3*7<23 → continue\\nS_{43}=506=22*23, 22=2*11<23 → continue\\nS_{44}=529=23*23 → continue\\nS_{45}=552=24*23, 24=2^3*3 → continue\\nS_{46}=575=25*23, 25=5^2 → continue\\nS_{47}=598=26*23, 26=2*13 → continue\\nS_{48}=621=27*23, 27=3^3 → continue\\nS_{49}=644=28*23, 28=2^2*7 → continue\\nS_{50}=667=29*23, 29>23 and prime → so lpd=29 → stop\\nSo we keep going as long as the cofactor is composed of primes ≤ p.\\nThe cofactor went from 19 to 20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29.\\nWhen cofactor=29, which is prime >23, so we switch.\\nSo the number of times p is used depends on when the cofactor first has a prime factor > p.\\nFor p=7: when did it stop?\\nS_{10}=35=5*7, cofactor 5<7\\nS_{11}=42=6*7, 6=2*3<7\\nS_{12}=49=7*7\\nS_{13}=56=8*7, 8=2^3\\nS_{14}=63=9*7, 9=3^2\\nS_{15}=70=10*7, 10=2*5\\nS_{16}=77=11*7, 11>7 and prime → so stop, next is 11\\nCofactors: 5,6,7,8,9,10,11 → stopped at 11\\nSo 6 terms: from S_{10} to S_{16}, but a_{11} to a_{16} are the 6 terms of 7.\\nThe sum before adding the first 7 is S_{10}=35, then we add 7 six times: S_{11} to S_{16} = 42,49,56,63,70,77\\nThe cofactors are 6,7,8,9,10,11 → when cofactor=11>7, we stop.\\nSimilarly for p=11: S_{16}=77, then add 11 six times:\\nS_{17}=88=8*11, 8<11\\nS_{18}=99=9*11, 9<11\\nS_{19}=110=10*11, 10<11\\nS_{20}=121=11*11\\nS_{21}=132=12*11, 12=2^2*3<11?
