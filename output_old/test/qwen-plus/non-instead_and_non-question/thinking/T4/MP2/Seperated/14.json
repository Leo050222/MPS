Testing small values and using modular arithmetic, we find n=1 (2^1+2=4 divisible by 1), n=2 (2^2+2=6 divisible by 2), n=6 (2^6+2=66 divisible by 6), and n=66 (2^66+2 divisible by 66 via modular checks for 6 and 11). No other n < 100 satisfy the condition.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of regions formed by h horizontal lines (parallel) and s non-horizontal lines (no two parallel, no three concurrent) is given by R = 1 + h + s + hs + s(s-1)/2. Setting R=1992 leads to (s+1)(2h+s)=3982. Factoring 3982=2×11×181, valid factor pairs (a,b) where a=s+1 and b=2h+s yield solutions: (a=2,b=1991)→(h=995,s=1); (a=11,b=362)→(h=176,s=10); (a=22,b=181)→(h=80,s=21).
