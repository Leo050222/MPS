  "math_problem": "For some positive real $\\alpha$, the set $S$ of positive real numbers $x$ with $\\{x\\}>\\alpha x$ consists of the union of several intervals, with total length 20.2. The value of $\\alpha$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Let $g = \\gcd(p, q)$, where $p/q$ is the representation of $\\alpha$ as a reduced fraction with positive integers $p, q$. Ainsley and Buddy play a game where they repeatedly roll a standard fair six-sided die. Ainsley wins if two multiples of 3 in a row are rolled before a non-multiple of 3 followed by a multiple of 3, and Buddy wins otherwise. If the probability that Ainsley wins is $\\frac{a}{b}$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$ with $\\gcd(a,b)=g$, compute $100a+b$.",
