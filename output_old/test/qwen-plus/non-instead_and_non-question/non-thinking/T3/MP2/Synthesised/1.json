Computing $ T(favorable) $: the number of ways five players each choose two roles (from 5 roles), such that each role is chosen by exactly two players.\\n2. Using this value to compute an average of $ \\\\|k\\\\| $, defined as the absolute difference between $ k $ and the nearest perfect square, and solving for the smallest $ n $ such that:\\n   \\n   $$\\n   \\\\frac{\\\\|1\\\\| + \\\\|2\\\\| + \\\\cdots + \\\\|n\\\\|}{n} = T(favorable) - 1940\\n   $$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Understanding $ T(favorable) $\\n\\n- There are 5 players.\\n- There are 5 roles: say $ R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4, R_5 $.\\n- Each player chooses **two distinct roles** they wish to play.\\n- So total role choices made: $ 5 \\\\times 2 = 10 $.\\n- We want each role to be chosen **exactly twice**, so total assignments = 10, and each role appears twice → this matches.\\n\\nSo we are counting the number of 5-tuples of 2-element subsets (one per player) such that each role appears in exactly two of the subsets.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to: **count the number of 5-regular 2-uniform hypergraphs on 5 vertices with degree 2 at each vertex?** Not quite — actually, it's a multiset assignment.\\n\\nBut more precisely: We are assigning to each of 5 players a 2-element subset of the 5 roles, such that each role appears in exactly two of the 5 subsets.\\n\\nSo we are counting the number of **5-tuples of 2-element subsets of a 5-element set**, such that each element appears in exactly two subsets.\\n\\nLet’s denote the set of roles as $ \\\\{A,B,C,D,E\\\\} $.\\n\\nEach player picks a pair (unordered, distinct roles). The collection of 5 pairs must cover each role exactly twice.\\n\\nTotal number of times roles appear: $ 5 \\\\text{ players} \\\\times 2 = 10 $, and $ 5 \\\\text{ roles} \\\\times 2 = 10 $, so it balances.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to decomposing the multigraph where each vertex has degree 2 into 5 edges (each edge used once), but wait — no, we are selecting 5 unordered pairs (edges), possibly repeated, such that each vertex appears in exactly two of them.\\n\\nSo think of it as a 2-regular multigraph on 5 vertices with 5 edges (since 5 pairs), but each vertex has degree 2 → sum of degrees = 10 → number of edges = 5, which matches.\\n\\nSo we are counting the number of **2-regular labeled multigraphs** on 5 labeled vertices (roles), with 5 edges (player choices), where each edge corresponds to a pair of roles chosen by one player, and each vertex has degree 2.\\n\\nBut since the players are distinguishable, the order of the 5 edges matters (i.e., which player picked which pair).\\n\\nAlternatively: We are counting the number of **multisets of 5 unordered pairs (edges)** from a 5-element set, such that each element appears in exactly two pairs, and then assign these 5 pairs to the 5 players (so labeling matters).\\n\\nBut since players are distinct, we can instead count the number of functions from 5 players to $ \\\\binom{5}{2} = 10 $ possible pairs, such that each role appears in exactly two of the selected pairs.\\n\\nSo we need to count the number of 5-tuples $ (P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5) $, where each $ P_i \\\\subseteq [5] $, $ |P_i| = 2 $, and each role appears in exactly two of the $ P_i $'s.\\n\\nThis is a classic combinatorics problem.\\n\\nLet’s reframe: We are choosing a 2-regular graph (in terms of vertex degrees) on 5 vertices, using 5 edges (since sum of degrees = 10), but allowing multiple edges?\\n\\nWait: Can a player pick the same pair as another? Yes, unless restricted. But nothing says pairs must be unique, so repetitions are allowed.\\n\\nBut can a role be in two identical pairs? For example, two players both pick {A,B}? That would mean A and B each get +1 count from each such choice, so if two players pick {A,B}, then A and B each have degree at least 2 already. Then other roles must still be covered.\\n\\nBut we need **each role** to appear exactly twice.\\n\\nSo let’s consider what kind of graphs (multigraphs) on 5 vertices with 5 edges, each vertex degree 2.\\n\\nSuch a graph is a **2-regular multigraph** on 5 vertices.\\n\\nIn simple graphs, 2-regular means disjoint union of cycles. On 5 vertices, only possibility is a 5-cycle.\\n\\nBut here, since we allow multiple edges or loops?\\n\\nWait: Can a player choose the same role twice? No — they choose **two of the five roles**, so distinct. So no loops.\\n\\nBut can two players choose the same pair? Yes — so **multiple edges** are allowed.\\n\\nBut also, could a single player's choice create a double edge? No — each edge is selected once per player.\\n\\nBut more importantly: Could there be a multigraph with multiple edges?\\n\\nFor example: two players choose {A,B}, then A and B each have degree 2 already. Then the remaining three players must choose pairs among C,D,E, but each of C,D,E needs to be in two pairs. But only three players left, each contributes two role appearances → 6 total, and C,D,E need 6 appearances → okay.\\n\\nBut the remaining three players must cover C,D,E with each appearing twice.\\n\\nBut each player picks two roles, so three players → 6 role-slots, and three roles × 2 = 6 → possible.\\n\\nBut can we do it? Suppose we try:\\n\\n- Players 1,2: {A,B} → A:2, B:2\\n- Now players 3,4,5 must pick pairs from {C,D,E}, each role used twice.\\n\\nPossible? Let's see:\\n\\nSuppose:\\n- P3: {C,D}\\n- P4: {C,E}\\n- P5: {D,E}\\n\\nThen: C:2, D:2, E:2 → perfect.\\n\\nSo this works. And the multigraph has two copies of edge AB, and one each of CD, CE, DE.\\n\\nBut now check degrees: A:2 (from two ABs), B:2, C:2, D:2, E:2 → good.\\n\\nBut is this a 2-regular multigraph? Yes.\\n\\nBut now, in this configuration, the edge AB appears twice.\\n\\nSo we need to count all such 5-tuples of edges (with labels — players are distinct), such that the multiset of edges has each vertex in exactly two edges.\\n\\nSince players are labeled, we are counting the number of sequences (or assignments) of 5 unordered pairs (edges) such that each vertex appears in exactly two of them.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of **2-regular loopless multigraphs** on 5 labeled vertices with 5 edges, with labeled edges (since players are distinguishable).\\n\\nAlternatively: Think of it as decomposing the complete multigraph where each vertex has degree 2 into 5 edges.\\n\\nBut perhaps better: This is equivalent to counting the number of **5-edge multigraphs** on 5 labeled vertices, with no loops, each vertex degree 2, and edges are assigned to players (so edge labels matter).\\n\\nBut since players are distinguishable, we are counting the number of functions from players to $ \\\\binom{5}{2} $, such that the resulting degree sequence is (2,2,2,2,2).\\n\\nSo we can model this as: Assign to each player a pair (edge), and count how many such assignments result in each role being chosen exactly twice.\\n\\nThis is similar to counting the number of 5-tuples of edges (with replacement allowed) such that the degree of each vertex is 2.\\n\\nWe can use combinatorics or known results.\\n\\nAlternatively, recall that this is a known type of design: a **2-regular 2-uniform hypergraph** with multiplicity, but perhaps we can enumerate the possible **isomorphism types** of such multigraphs, and count how many labeled versions exist, then multiply by the number of ways to assign to players.\\n\\nBut since the players are labeled, and the roles are labeled, we can proceed by considering the possible **multigraph structures** (up to isomorphism), compute their automorphism counts, and use orbit-counting, but that might be messy.\\n\\nAlternatively, note that this is equivalent to the number of **semi-regular bipartite matchings** or use generating functions.\\n\\nBut here’s a better idea: This is equivalent to the number of **5 × 5 binary matrices** where:\\n\\n- Each row corresponds to a player, has exactly two 1's (for the two roles chosen)\\n- Each column corresponds to a role, has exactly two 1's (each role chosen by two players)\\n\\nSo we are counting the number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with exactly two 1's per row and per column.\\n\\nThis is a standard combinatorial object: the number of **5×5 (0,1)-matrices with row sums = 2 and column sums = 2**.\\n\\nThis is known as the number of **semi-regular bipartite graphs** of degree 2 on both sides, or equivalently, the number of 2-regular bipartite graphs with 5+5 vertices.\\n\\nBut more precisely, it's the number of **bipartite graphs** with bipartition (Players, Roles), each player has degree 2, each role has degree 2.\\n\\nYes! That’s a perfect model.\\n\\nLet $ G = (U, V, E) $, where:\\n- $ U = \\\\{P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4,P_5\\\\} $: players\\n- $ V = \\\\{R_1,R_2,R_3,R_4,R_5\\\\} $: roles\\n- Each $ P_i $ has degree 2 (chooses 2 roles)\\n- Each $ R_j $ has degree 2 (chosen by 2 players)\\n\\nSo we are counting the number of **bipartite graphs** with both partitions of size 5, each vertex degree 2.\\n\\nThis is a well-known enumeration problem.\\n\\nThe number of such bipartite graphs is equal to the number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums all equal to 2.\\n\\nThis number is known and can be computed via formula or OEIS.\\n\\nThe number of such matrices is given by the formula involving multinomial coefficients and inclusion-exclusion, or we can look up the sequence.\\n\\nIt is known that the number of $ n \\\\times n $ (0,1)-matrices with all row and column sums equal to $ k $ is given by the coefficient of $ \\\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i^k y_i^k $ in $ \\\\prod_{i,j} (1 + x_i y_j) $, but computationally, for small $ n $, we can use known values.\\n\\nFor $ n=5, k=2 $, this number is known.\\n\\nAlternatively, we can compute it.\\n\\nThe number of such matrices is equal to the number of 2-regular digraphs or use permanent, but better to use formula.\\n\\nThere is a formula:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Number} = \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma \\\\in S_5} \\\\left( \\\\text{number of ways to assign two columns to each row such that column sums are 2} \\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nBut standard result: The number of $ n \\\\times n $ (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums all equal to $ k $ is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\prod_{j=1}^n \\\\left( \\\\sum_{m=0}^k \\\\binom{k}{m} e^{i m \\\\theta} \\\\right)^n \\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{2\\\\pi}\\n$$\\n\\nToo hard.\\n\\nInstead, recall that this is equivalent to the number of **2-factors** in the complete bipartite graph $ K_{5,5} $, but not quite — we are not requiring connectedness.\\n\\nActually, it's the number of 2-regular subgraphs that cover all vertices — i.e., disjoint unions of even cycles covering all vertices in both partitions.\\n\\nBut since it's bipartite, all cycles are even, and we need to decompose $ K_{5,5} $ into a 2-regular subgraph, i.e., a 2-factor.\\n\\nBut we are not decomposing the whole graph; we are just selecting a subgraph where each vertex has degree 2.\\n\\nYes — so we are counting the number of 2-factors in $ K_{5,5} $? No — not the number of 2-factors, but the number of spanning subgraphs where every vertex has degree 2. Since $ K_{5,5} $ is complete, any such subgraph is a 2-factor.\\n\\nAnd a 2-factor in a bipartite graph is a disjoint union of even cycles covering all vertices.\\n\\nSo we are counting the number of 2-factors in $ K_{5,5} $, where the vertices are labeled.\\n\\nBut wait: In our case, the edges are not pre-selected; we are just assigning for each player two roles, so it's exactly selecting such a subgraph.\\n\\nBut in our matrix count, we are counting the number of such adjacency matrices, which corresponds exactly to the number of 2-factors (as subgraphs) in $ K_{5,5} $, with labeled vertices.\\n\\nBut actually, no: a 2-factor is a spanning 2-regular subgraph, which is exactly what we want.\\n\\nSo yes, we are counting the number of 2-factors in $ K_{5,5} $, with labeled vertices on both sides.\\n\\nBut in graph theory, the number of 2-factors in $ K_{n,n} $ is known.\\n\\nFor $ K_{n,n} $, the number of 2-factors (i.e., spanning subgraphs that are 2-regular) is equal to the number of ways to decompose the bipartite graph into a 2-regular graph, which is equivalent to the number of **permutation matrices** for degree 2.\\n\\nActually, each 2-factor corresponds to a permutation that is a product of disjoint cycles, but since it's bipartite, each cycle alternates between the two sets.\\n\\nBut more directly: The number of $ n \\\\times n $ (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums all equal to 2 is a known integer sequence.\\n\\nLet me recall or compute it.\\n\\nWe can use the formula:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Number} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\\\binom{n}{k} \\\\left( \\\\binom{n-k}{2} \\\\right)^n ?\\n$$\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nBetter: Use the configuration model or known values.\\n\\nI recall that the number of such matrices is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{(n!)^2}{(k!)^n} \\\\times \\\\text{coefficient or something}\\n$$\\n\\nAlternatively, for small $ n $, we can look up or compute.\\n\\nFor $ n=5, k=2 $, the number is known to be **120**? No, too small.\\n\\nLet me compute step by step.\\n\\nWe can think of it as: First, assign to each player two roles, such that each role is chosen twice.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to the number of **biregular bipartite graphs**.\\n\\nThere is a formula:\\n\\nThe number is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{A} \\\\frac{5!}{\\\\prod_{i} \\\\text{aut}(A_i)} }\\n$$\\n\\nBut better to use the fact that this is the same as the number of **semi-magic squares** of order 5 with line sum 2.\\n\\nI found online or recall that the number of $ n \\\\times n $ (0,1)-matrices with all row and column sums equal to $ k $ is given by OEIS A001501 for $ k=2 $.\\n\\nCheck OEIS A001501: Number of $ n \\\\times n $ matrices with nonnegative integer entries and row and column sums equal to 2.\\n\\nBut that allows entries >1? No — for (0,1)-matrices, it's different.\\n\\nWait, no: if entries are 0 or 1, and row sum 2, then it's simple.\\n\\nOEIS A008300 gives the number of $ n \\\\times n $ (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums equal to $ k $.\\n\\nFor $ k=2 $, the sequence is:\\n\\nn=1: 0\\nn=2: 1\\nn=3: 6\\nn=4: 90\\nn=5: 2040\\n\\nWait, let me verify.\\n\\nI can compute for small n.\\n\\nFor n=2: each row has two 1's, but only two columns, so each row must be [1,1], so matrix is all ones. Column sums: each column has sum 2 → valid. Only one such matrix.\\n\\nBut players: two players, each choose two roles out of two → only one choice: both choose {1,2}. Then each role is chosen by two players → yes. So T=1.\\n\\nBut in our case n=5.\\n\\nFor n=3: each player chooses 2 roles out of 3, total 6 role-choices, each role should be chosen twice.\\n\\nNumber of 3×3 (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums 2.\\n\\nEach row has two 1's: there are $ \\\\binom{3}{2}=3 $ choices per row.\\n\\nTotal without column constraint: $ 3^3 = 27 $.\\n\\nNow subtract those with column sums not 2.\\n\\nBut easier: this is equivalent to the complement: each row has one 0, each column has one 0 (since sum=2 → one zero per row and column).\\n\\nSo the positions of zeros form a permutation matrix.\\n\\nSo number is $ 3! = 6 $.\\n\\nYes! So for $ n=3 $, it's 6.\\n\\nSimilarly, for general $ n $, the number of $ n \\\\times n $ (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums equal to $ n-1 $ is $ n! $, because the zeros form a permutation matrix.\\n\\nBut here, for $ n=5 $, row sum = 2, not 4.\\n\\nSo not the complement.\\n\\nBut we can use the general formula.\\n\\nThe number of $ n \\\\times n $ (0,1)-matrices with all row and column sums equal to $ k $ is given by:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{\\\\sigma \\\\in S_n} \\\\left( \\\\text{number of ways to choose k columns for each row avoiding conflicts} \\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nBut standard way: use the formula involving permanents or recursion.\\n\\nI recall that for $ n=5, k=2 $, the number is **120**? No.\\n\\nAnother way: This is equal to the number of 2-factors in $ K_{5,5} $.\\n\\nA 2-factor in $ K_{5,5} $ is a disjoint union of even cycles covering all 10 vertices.\\n\\nSince it's bipartite, cycles must be of even length.\\n\\nThe possible cycle type decompositions for 10 vertices:\\n\\n- One 10-cycle\\n- An 8-cycle and a 2-cycle — but 2-cycle not possible in simple graph (would require two edges between same pair, but in $ K_{5,5} $, only one edge per pair? No — in simple graph, no multiple edges, but in our case, can a player choose the same pair as another? But in the bipartite graph model, an edge is between a player and a role. Multiple edges? No — each player-role pair can be chosen or not, but in our matrix, entry is 0 or 1, so **no multiple edges**.\\n\\nWait a minute! In our bipartite graph model:\\n- Left side: 5 players\\n- Right side: 5 roles\\n- An edge between player P and role R means that player P chose role R.\\n- Each player has degree 2 (chooses 2 roles)\\n- Each role has degree 2 (chosen by 2 players)\\n- The graph is simple: no multiple edges (a player either chose a role or not)\\n\\nSo it's a **simple bipartite graph**, no multiple edges.\\n\\nTherefore, the adjacency matrix has 0s and 1s, and we are counting the number of such simple graphs with degree 2 on each vertex.\\n\\nAnd since it's simple, no multiple edges, so in particular, no two edges between same player and role, which is fine.\\n\\nBut can two players choose the same *pair* of roles? Yes, as long as they are different players. For example, player 1 and player 2 both choose roles A and B. In the bipartite graph, this means:\\n- P1 connected to A and B\\n- P2 connected to A and B\\n- So edges: P1-A, P1-B, P2-A, P2-B\\n\\nWhich is fine — no multiple edges.\\n\\nSo the graph is simple.\\n\\nNow, such a graph is 2-regular on both sides, so it's a disjoint union of even cycles covering all vertices.\\n\\nThe possible cycle type decompositions for 10 vertices (5+5):\\n\\n- One 10-cycle\\n- An 8-cycle and a 2-cycle — impossible, since 2-cycle would require two vertices, one from each side, but a 2-cycle would be P-A-P, but that's not a cycle in simple graph — minimum cycle is 4-cycle.\\n- A 6-cycle and a 4-cycle\\n- Two 4-cycles and a 2-cycle — impossible\\n- A 4-cycle and three 2-cycles — no\\n- Five 2-cycles — no\\n\\nSo only possibilities:\\n\\n1. One 10-cycle\\n2. One 6-cycle and one 4-cycle\\n3. Two 4-cycles and one 2-cycle — impossible\\n4. Three cycles: but 4+4+2 invalid\\n\\nWait, 4+6=10, 10=10, 4+4+2 invalid, 4+3+3 invalid, etc.\\n\\nAlso: two 4-cycles would cover 8 vertices, leaving 2 vertices (one player, one role), which cannot form a cycle (minimum 4). So impossible.\\n\\nSimilarly, three 4-cycles too big.\\n\\nSo only possibilities:\\n\\n- One 10-cycle\\n- One 6-cycle and one 4-cycle\\n\\nThat's it.\\n\\nNow, we count the number of such 2-factors (disjoint cycle covers) in $ K_{5,5} $ with labeled vertices.\\n\\nLet’s compute both cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Case 1: One 10-cycle\\n\\nWe need to count the number of Hamiltonian cycles in $ K_{5,5} $ that alternate between players and roles.\\n\\nIn a bipartite graph, a Hamiltonian cycle must alternate between the two sets.\\n\\nNumber of ways to arrange the 5 players and 5 roles in an alternating cycle.\\n\\nFix a starting vertex, say a player. But since the graph is undirected, we have to be careful.\\n\\nStandard count: Number of Hamiltonian cycles in $ K_{n,n} $ is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{(n!)^2}{2n}\\n$$\\n\\nWhy? \\n- Choose an ordering of the players: $ n! $ ways\\n- Choose an ordering of the roles: $ n! $ ways\\n- Then the cycle is: P1-R1-P2-R2-...-Pn-Rn-P1, but this is a specific matching.\\n\\nBut in a cycle, we can start anywhere and go in two directions.\\n\\nTo count directed Hamiltonian cycles that alternate: \\n- Start at a player: choose order of players: $ n! $ ways\\n- Choose order of roles: $ n! $ ways\\n- Then the cycle is P_{\\\\sigma(1)} - R_{\\\\tau(1)} - P_{\\\\sigma(2)} - R_{\\\\tau(2)} - \\\\cdots - P_{\\\\sigma(n)} - R_{\\\\tau(n)} - back to P_{\\\\sigma(1)}\\n\\nBut this determines the edges.\\n\\nHowever, this counts directed cycles, and we can rotate the cycle (n choices for starting player), and also we could start with a role, but since we fixed starting with a player, and direction, this counts each directed cycle exactly once for each starting point? No.\\n\\nIn this construction, each directed cycle is counted once for each of the n possible starting players, and for each, the sequence is fixed.\\n\\nActually, no: when we fix the order of players and roles, we get one directed cycle.\\n\\nBut different orders may give the same cycle.\\n\\nActually, each directed Hamiltonian cycle is determined by the sequence of players and roles.\\n\\nThe number of directed Hamiltonian cycles in $ K_{n,n} $ is $ (n!)^2 / n = n! (n-1)! $? Let's think.\\n\\nStandard formula: The number of directed Hamiltonian cycles in $ K_{n,n} $ is:\\n\\n$$\\n(n-1)! \\\\cdot n!\\n$$\\n\\nBecause: Fix a starting player (say P1). Then choose the sequence of roles and players alternately.\\n\\nFrom P1, go to any of n roles. Then to any of the remaining n-1 players, then to any of the remaining n-1 roles, and so on.\\n\\nBut after P1 -> R_i, then to P_j (j≠1), then to R_k (k≠i), etc.\\n\\nSo number of directed cycles starting and ending at P1: \\n- Choose first role: n choices\\n- Choose next player: n-1 choices (not P1)\\n- Choose next role: n-1 choices (not the first)\\n- Next player: n-2\\n- Next role: n-2\\n- ... until last player: 1 choice, last role: 1 choice, then back to P1.\\n\\nSo total: $ n \\\\times (n-1) \\\\times (n-1) \\\\times (n-2) \\\\times (n-2) \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times 1 \\\\times 1 $\\n\\n= $ n \\\\times [(n-1)!]^2 $\\n\\nThen since the cycle is directed and we fixed the starting point P1, but in reality, each directed cycle passes through P1 once, so this counts each directed cycle exactly once.\\n\\nSo number of directed Hamiltonian cycles is $ n \\\\times [(n-1)!]^2 $\\n\\nFor n=5: $ 5 \\\\times (4!)^2 = 5 \\\\times 24^2 = 5 \\\\times 576 = 2880 $\\n\\nBut each undirected cycle corresponds to two directed cycles (clockwise and counterclockwise), so number of undirected Hamiltonian cycles is $ \\\\frac{2880}{2} = 1440 $\\n\\nBut in our case, for the graph, each such cycle corresponds to a unique 2-factor (the cycle itself).\\n\\nBut wait: in our bipartite graph, the 2-factor is the set of edges in the cycle, and since it's a cycle, it defines the entire graph.\\n\\nSo for case 1, number of 2-factors that are a single 10-cycle is 1440.\\n\\nBut is that the number of subgraphs or the number of ways?\\n\\nYes, each such cycle defines a unique set of 10 edges? No: a 10-cycle has 10 edges, but in our graph, we have 5 players, each with degree 2, so total edges = 10, yes.\\n\\nAnd each such cycle uses 10 edges, covering all vertices, so yes.\\n\\nBut in our count, we have counted the number of such cycle subgraphs.\\n\\nBut in our original problem, are we counting the number of such graphs, or is there more?\\n\\nYes, this is part of it.\\n\\nBut we also have the other case.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Case 2: One 6-cycle and one 4-cycle\\n\\nWe need to partition the 5 players into two sets: one of size 3 (for the 6-cycle), one of size 2 (for the 4-cycle)?\\n\\nA 6-cycle involves 3 players and 3 roles.\\nA 4-cycle involves 2 players and 2 roles.\\n\\nYes, since alternating.\\n\\nSo:\\n- Choose 3 players out of 5: $ \\\\binom{5}{3} = 10 $\\n- Choose 3 roles out of 5: $ \\\\binom{5}{3} = 10 $\\n\\nNow, for the 3 players and 3 roles, number of 6-cycles (undirected Hamiltonian cycles in $ K_{3,3} $).\\n\\nUsing the same formula: for $ K_{3,3} $, number of undirected Hamiltonian cycles.\\n\\nUsing formula: number of directed cycles: $ n \\\\times [(n-1)!]^2 = 3 \\\\times (2!)^2 = 3 \\\\times 4 = 12 $\\nThen undirected: $ 12 / 2 = 6 $\\n\\nIs that correct?\\n\\nFor $ K_{3,3} $, fix players A,B,C, roles X,Y,Z.\\nA directed cycle: start at A, go to X, then to B, to Y, to C, to Z, back to A.\\nOr A->X->B->Z->C->Y->A, etc.\\n\\nNumber of ways: from A, choose first role: 3 choices. Then choose next player: 2 choices. Then next role: 2 choices (not the first). Then next player: 1 choice. Then next role: 1 choice. Then back to A.\\nSo directed cycles from A: 3*2*2*1*1 = 12\\nBut this is for fixed starting point A.\\nSince there are 3 players, total directed cycles: 12 * 3 / 3 = 12? No.\\nWhen we fix starting at A, we get 12 directed cycles starting at A.\\nBut each directed cycle has 6 starting points, so total number of directed cycles is (12) * (number of starting points) / length? No.\\nIf we count the number of directed cycles (as sequences), each cycle is counted 6 times (once for each starting vertex).\\nSo total number of distinct directed cycles is (number of sequences) / 6.\\nBut we have: for each starting player, we have 3*2*2*1*1 = 12 sequences of length 6 that return to start.\\nBut each such sequence is a directed cycle.\\nAnd there are 3 choices for starting player, so total 3 * 12 = 36 sequences, but each directed cycle is counted 6 times (6 starting points), so number of directed cycles is 36 / 6 = 6.\\nContradiction.\\n\\nBetter: fix the starting player, say A.\\nNumber of directed Hamiltonian cycles starting and ending at A.\\nFrom A, choose first role: 3 choices.\\nThen choose next player: 2 choices (B or C).\\nThen choose next role: 2 choices (not the first).\\nThen choose next player: 1 choice (the remaining one).\\nThen choose next role: 1 choice (the remaining one).\\nThen back to A.\\nSo 3*2*2*1*1 = 12.\\nEach directed cycle is counted once for each starting point, but since we fixed the starting point A, this counts each directed cycle that includes A exactly once per occurrence, but each cycle has only one A, so this counts each directed cycle exactly once? No, because a cycle can be traversed in two directions.\\nFor example, cycle A-X-B-Y-C-Z-A is different from A-Z-C-Y-B-X-A.\\nIn our count, when we go A->X->B->Y->C->Z->A, that's one.\\nA->Z->C->Y->B->X->A is another.\\nAnd we will count both.\\nSo the 12 includes both directions.\\nAnd since we fixed the starting point, each directed cycle is counted exactly once.\\nSo there are 12 directed Hamiltonian cycles starting and ending at A.\\nBut each full directed cycle is associated with one such path from A back to A.\\nSo there are 12 directed Hamiltonian cycles in $ K_{3,3} $.\\nThen since each undirected cycle corresponds to two directed ones, number of undirected Hamiltonian cycles is 12 / 2 = 6.\\nYes.\\n\\nWe can also know that $ K_{3,3} $ has 6 perfect matchings, but for cycles, it's 6.\\n\\nSo for the 3x3 part, number of 6-cycles (undirected) is 6.\\n\\nSimilarly, for the 2x2 part: $ K_{2,2} $, number of 4-cycles.\\n$ K_{2,2} $ is itself a 4-cycle, and it's the only one.\\nNumber of undirected Hamiltonian cycles in $ K_{2,2} $: only one, up to the labeling.\\nWith labeled vertices: say players P1,P2, roles R1,R2.\\nThe cycle must be P1-R1-P2-R2-P1 or P1-R2-P2-R1-P1, but these are the same undirected cycle.\\nSo only one undirected 4-cycle.\\nUsing formula: directed cycles: n * [(n-1)!]^2 = 2 * (1!)^2 = 2\\nUndirected: 2/2 = 1.\\nYes.\\n\\nSo for the 2x2 part, only 1 undirected 4-cycle.\\n\\nNow, back to counting.\\nFor case 2:\\n- Choose 3 players: $ \\\\binom{5}{3} = 10 $\\n- Choose 3 roles: $ \\\\binom{5}{3} = 10 $\\n- For the 3x3 group, number of 6-cycles: 6\\n- For the remaining 2 players and 2 roles, number of 4-cycles: 1\\n\\nSo total for this case: $ 10 \\\\times 10 \\\\times 6 \\\\times 1 = 600 $\\n\\nBut is that correct? We have specified the cycle decomposition, and each such choice gives a unique 2-factor (the union of the two cycles).\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nNow, are there any other cases? Earlier we said only 10-cycle and 6+4.\\nWhat about three cycles? 4+4+2 impossible.\\nOr 4+3+3 no.\\nOr two 4-cycles and something: 4+4=8, leaves 2 vertices, can't form cycle.\\nOr five 2-cycles: not possible.\\nSo only two cases.\\n\\nTherefore, total number of 2-factors (i.e., number of such bipartite graphs) is:\\n\\nCase 1: 1440\\nCase 2: 600\\nTotal: 1440 + 600 = 2040\\n\\nSo $ T(favorable) = 2040 $\\n\\nBut is this the number of graphs, or the number of assignments?\\n\\nIn our model, each such 2-factor corresponds to a unique adjacency matrix, which corresponds to a unique assignment of role choices to players.\\n\\nFor example, in the matrix, once we know which roles each player chose, it's determined.\\n\\nAnd since the graph is simple, no multiple edges, this is fine.\\n\\nAnd we have counted all such graphs where each player has degree 2, each role has degree 2.\\n\\nSo yes, $ T(favorable) = 2040 $\\n\\nNow, the problem asks for:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\|1\\\\| + \\\\|2\\\\| + \\\\cdots + \\\\|n\\\\|}{n} = T(favorable) - 1940 = 2040 - 1940 = 100\\n$$\\n\\nSo we need:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\|k\\\\| = 100\\n$$\\n\\nSo $ \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\|k\\\\| = 100n $\\n\\nNow, $ \\\\|k\\\\| $ is the distance from $ k $ to the nearest perfect square.\\n\\nLet’s understand the behavior of $ \\\\|k\\\\| $.\\n\\nPerfect squares: 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,...\\n\\nBetween $ m^2 $ and $ (m+1)^2 $, the nearest square changes at the midpoint.\\n\\nThe midpoint between $ m^2 $ and $ (m+1)^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1 $ is at $ m^2 + m + 0.5 $\\n\\nSo for $ k $ from $ m^2 $ to $ m^2 + m $, the nearest square is $ m^2 $, so $ \\\\|k\\\\| = k - m^2 $\\n\\nFor $ k $ from $ m^2 + m + 1 $ to $ (m+1)^2 $, the nearest square is $ (m+1)^2 $, so $ \\\\|k\\\\| = (m+1)^2 - k $\\n\\nAt $ k = m^2 + m + 0.5 $, equidistant, but since k integer, at $ k = m^2 + m $, distance to $ m^2 $ is m, to $ (m+1)^2 $ is (m^2+2m+1) - (m^2+m) = m+1, so nearer to $ m^2 $\\nAt $ k = m^2 + m + 1 $, distance to $ m^2 $ is m+1, to $ (m+1)^2 $ is m, so nearer to $ (m+1)^2 $\\n\\nSo indeed:\\n- For $ k = m^2, m^2+1, \\\\ldots, m^2 + m $: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = k - m^2 $\\n- For $ k = m^2 + m + 1, \\\\ldots, (m+1)^2 $: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = (m+1)^2 - k $\\n\\nAnd the values are symmetric.\\n\\nNow, let’s compute the sum over one block from $ m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 - 1 $\\n\\nLet $ a_m = \\\\sum_{k=m^2}^{(m+1)^2 - 1} \\\\|k\\\\| $\\n\\nThe interval has length $ (m+1)^2 - m^2 = 2m+1 $\\n\\nSplit into two parts:\\n\\nPart 1: $ k = m^2 $ to $ m^2 + m $: $ m+1 $ terms\\n$ \\\\|k\\\\| = k - m^2 $, so sum = $ \\\\sum_{j=0}^{m} j = \\\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} $\\n\\nPart 2: $ k = m^2 + m + 1 $ to $ (m+1)^2 - 1 = m^2 + 2m $\\nNumber of terms: $ (m^2 + 2m) - (m^2 + m + 1) + 1 = m - 1 + 1 = m $? Wait\\nFrom $ m^2 + m + 1 $ to $ m^2 + 2m $, inclusive.\\nNumber of terms: $ (m^2 + 2m) - (m^2 + m + 1) + 1 = 2m - m -1 +1 = m $\\nValues: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = (m+1)^2 - k = (m^2 + 2m + 1) - k $\\nLet $ j = k - (m^2 + m + 1) $, then k = m^2 + m + 1 + j, j=0 to m-1\\nThen $ \\\\|k\\\\| = (m^2 + 2m + 1) - (m^2 + m + 1 + j) = m - j $\\nSo sum = $ \\\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} (m - j) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m} i = \\\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} $? No\\nj from 0 to m-1, m - j from m down to 1, so sum = $ \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m} i = \\\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} $\\nBut number of terms is m, from 1 to m, sum is $ \\\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} $\\nYes.\\n\\nBut earlier part 1 sum is also $ \\\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} $\\n\\nSo total for the block: $ a_m = \\\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} + \\\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} = m(m+1) $\\n\\nBut is that right? For m=1:\\nSquares: 1,4\\nk=1: ||1|| = |1-1|=0? Nearest square is 1, distance 0.\\nk=2: dist to 1 is 1, to 4 is 2, so ||2||=1\\nk=3: dist to 1 is 2, to 4 is 1, so ||3||=1\\nSum from k=1 to 3: 0+1+1=2\\nFormula: m=1, a_1 = 1*2=2, yes.\\n\\nFor m=2:\\nk=4:0\\nk=5:1 (to 4)\\nk=6:2 (to 4)\\nk=7: dist to 4 is 3, to 9 is 2, so ||7||=2\\nk=8: to 9 is 1\\nSum: 0+1+2+2+1=6\\nFormula: m=2, a_2=2*3=6, yes.\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nSo sum from $ k=m^2 $ to $ (m+1)^2 - 1 $ is $ m(m+1) $\\n\\nNow, the total sum $ s(n) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\|k\\\\| $\\n\\nNote that $ k=1 $ is $ 1^2 $, so we start from m=1.\\n\\nLet’s find up to which square we go.\\n\\nLet $ M $ be such that $ M^2 \\\\leq n < (M+1)^2 $\\n\\nThen\\n\\n$$\\ns(n) = \\\\sum_{m=1}^{M-1} a_m + \\\\sum_{k=M^2}^{n} \\\\|k\\\\|\\n$$\\n\\nFirst sum: $ \\\\sum_{m=1}^{M-1} m(m+1) = \\\\sum_{m=1}^{M-1} (m^2 + m) = \\\\sum m^2 + \\\\sum m = \\\\frac{(M-1)M(2M-1)}{6} + \\\\frac{(M-1)M}{2} = \\\\frac{(M-1)M}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{2M-1}{3} + 1 \\\\right) = \\\\frac{(M-1)M}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{2M-1 + 3}{3} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{(M-1)M}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{2M+2}{3} = \\\\frac{(M-1)M(M+1)}{3} $\\n\\nNow, the second sum: from $ k=M^2 $ to $ n $\\n\\nWe need to split based on whether $ n \\\\leq M^2 + M $ or not.\\n\\nRecall:\\n- If $ k \\\\leq M^2 + M $, then $ \\\\|k\\\\| = k - M^2 $\\n- If $ k > M^2 + M $, then $ \\\\|k\\\\| = (M+1)^2 - k $\\n\\nNow, $ M^2 + M = M(M+1) $\\n$ (M+1)^2 = M^2 + 2M + 1 $\\n\\nSo if $ n \\\\leq M^2 + M $, then\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{k=M^2}^{n} \\\\|k\\\\| = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{n - M^2} j = \\\\frac{(n - M^2)(n - M^2 + 1)}{2}\\n$$\\n\\nIf $ n > M^2 + M $, then split at $ k = M^2 + M $\\n\\nSum from $ M^2 $ to $ M^2 + M $: $ \\\\sum_{j=0}^{M} j = \\\\frac{M(M+1)}{2} $\\n\\nSum from $ k = M^2 + M + 1 $ to $ n $: $ \\\\|k\\\\| = (M+1)^2 - k $\\nLet $ d = k - (M^2 + M + 1) $, then $ \\\\|k\\\\| = (M^2 + 2M + 1) - k = (M^2 + 2M + 1) - (M^2 + M + 1 + d) = M - d $\\nAnd d from 0 to $ n - (M^2 + M + 1) $\\nSo sum = $ \\\\sum_{d=0}^{n - M^2 - M - 1} (M - d) $\\n\\nLet $ t = n - M^2 - M - 1 $, then sum = $ \\\\sum_{d=0}^{t} (M - d) = (t+1)M - \\\\sum_{d=0}^{t} d = (t+1)M - \\\\frac{t(t+1)}{2} = (t+1) \\\\left( M - \\\\frac{t}{2} \\\\right) $\\n\\nBut we need $ s(n) = 100n $\\n\\nSince $ s(n) $ grows roughly like $ \\\\frac{1}{3} n^{3/2} $ or something, but let's estimate.\\n\\nNote that the average $ \\\\frac{s(n)}{n} $ should increase slowly.\\n\\nWe need it to be 100.\\n\\nLet us assume n is large, around where the average is 100.\\n\\nThe sum up to $ M^2 - 1 $ is $ \\\\sum_{m=1}^{M-1} a_m = \\\\frac{(M-1)M(M+1)}{3} $\\n\\nAnd $ n \\\\approx M^2 $, so $ s(n) \\\\approx \\\\frac{M^3}{3} $, so $ \\\\frac{s(n)}{n} \\\\approx \\\\frac{M^3/3}{M^2} = \\\\frac{M}{3} $\\n\\nSet $ \\\\frac{M}{3} \\\\approx 100 $, so M ≈ 300\\n\\nThen n ≈ M^2 = 90,000\\n\\nBut let's compute more carefully.\\n\\nWe need $ \\\\frac{s(n)}{n} = 100 $, so s(n) = 100n\\n\\nTry M such that $ \\\\frac{M}{3} \\\\approx 100 $, so M=300\\n\\nCompute sum up to $ M^2 - 1 = 90000 - 1 = 89999 $\\n\\nSum = $ \\\\frac{(M-1)M(M+1)}{3} = \\\\frac{299 \\\\times 300 \\\\times 301}{3} $\\n\\nCompute: 299/1 * 100 * 301 = 299 * 100 * 301\\nFirst, 300*301 = 90300, minus 301 = 89999?

No\\nM is such that M^2 <= n < (M+1)^2\\nn=89998, 299^2 = ? 300^2=90000, 299^2 = (300-1)^2 = 90000 - 600 + 1 = 89401\\n89401 <= 89998 < 90000, so M=299\\n\\nThen sum up to (M)^2 - 1 = 299^2 - 1 = 89401 - 1 = 89400\\nSum = \\\\frac{(M-1)M(M+1)}{3} = \\\\frac{298 \\\\times 299 \\\\times 300}{3} = 298 \\\\times 299 \\\\times 100\\n\\nCompute 298*299 = 298*(300-1) = 89400 - 298 = 89102\\nThen *100 = 8,910,200\\n\\nNow add sum from k=89401 to 89998\\n\\nM=299, so for k from M^2=89401 to min(n, M^2 + M) = min(89998, 89401 + 299) = min(89998, 89700)\\nM^2 + M = 89401 + 299 = 89700\\nn=89998 > 89700, so we have two parts.\\n\\nFirst, k=89401 to 89700: ||k|| = k - 89401\\nSum = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{299} j = \\\\frac{299 \\\\times 300}{2} = 44850\\nj from 0 to 299, sum = 299*300/2 = 44850\\n\\nSecond, k=89701 to 89998: ||k|| = (300)^2 - k = 90000 - k\\nk from 89701 to 89998\\nLet d = k - 89701, then k = 89701 + d, d=0 to 89998-89701=297\\n||k|| = 90000 - (89701 + d) = 299 - d\\nSum = \\\\sum_{d=0}^{297} (299 - d) = \\\\sum_{i=2}^{299} i  ? When d=0, 299; d=297, 299-297=2\\nSo values from 299 down to 2, inclusive.\\nSum = \\\\sum_{i=2}^{299} i = \\\\frac{299 \\\\times 300}{2} - 1 = 44850 - 1 = 44849\\nSum from 1 to 299 is 299*300/2=44850, minus 1 (for i=1), so 44849.\\n\\nSo total additional sum = 44850 + 44849 = 89699\\n\\nThus s(89998) = sum up to 89400 + sum from 89401 to 89998 = 8,910,200 + 89,699 = 8,999,899\\n\\nNow 100 * n = 100 * 89998 = 8,999,800\\n\\nBut 8,999,899 > 8,999,800, so s(n) > 100n\\n\\ns(n)/n = 8,999,899 / 89,998 ≈ ? But clearly greater than 100.\\n\\nBut we need s(n)/n = 100, so at n=89998, s(n) = 8,999,899 > 8,999,800 = 100n, so average >100.\\n\\nAt n=89999, s(n)=8,999,900, 100n=8,999,900, equal.\\n\\nNow, is there a smaller n where it equals 100?\\n\\nPossibly, but since at n=89998, s(n) > 100n, and s(n) increases by ||n|| each time, while 100n increases by 100, and ||n|| is much less than 100 for n<90000, so the difference s(n) - 100n is decreasing as n increases in this range.\\n\\nAt n=89998, s(n) - 100n = 8,999,899 - 8,999,800 = 99\\nAt n=89999, s(n) - 100n = 8,999,900 - 8,999,900 = 0\\n\\nNow, what about n=89997?\\nSimilarly, M=299, n=89997 > 89700, so\\nSum up to 89400: 8,910,200\\nSum k=89401 to 89700: 44850\\nSum k=89701 to 89997: ||k|| = 90000 - k\\nk from 89701 to 89997\\nd = k - 89701, d=0 to 296\\n||k|| = 299 - d\\nSum = \\\\sum_{d=0}^{296} (299 - d) = \\\\sum_{i=3}^{299} i = (sum_{i=1}^{299} i) - 1 - 2 = 44850 - 3 = 44847\\n\\nTotal sum = 8,910,200 + 44,850 + 44,847 = 8,910,200 + 89,697 = 8,999,897\\n\\n100n = 100*89997 = 8,999,700\\nDifference: 8,999,897 - 8,999,700 = 197 > 0\\n\\nAnd so on. As n decreases, s(n) - 100n increases, since s(n) increases by ||n|| < 100 for n not near squares, while 100n increases by 100.\\n\\nSpecifically, ||n|| ≤ max(m, m+1) for n near m^2, but for n=89999, ||n|| = |89999 - 90000| =1, since 300^2=90000, and 299^2=89401, distance to 90000 is 1, to 89401 is 598, so ||89999||=1\\nSimilarly, ||89998||=2, etc.\\n\\nSo the increment of s(n) is at most, say, 300, but 100n increases by 100, so s(n) - 100n decreases by about 100 - ||n|| each step, which is positive, so s(n) - 100n is decreasing as n increases.\\n\\nSince at n=89999, it is zero, and for n<89999, it is positive, so s(n)/n > 100 for n<89999, and equal at n=89999.\\n\\nBut we need s(n)/n = 100, so at n=89999, it is exactly 100.\\n\\nIs there any n<89999 where it could be 100? Only if s(n)/n=100, but since s(n) - 100n >0 for n<89999, and s(n)/n >100, while at n=89999 it is 100, so it's the smallest.\\n\\nBut is s(n)/n >100 for n<89999? At n=89998, s(n)=8,999,899, 100n=8,999,800, so s(n)/n = 8,999,899 / 89,998 ≈ 100.0011 >100\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nBut we need the average to be exactly 100, so n=89999 is the smallest where it equals 100.\\n\\nBut earlier I assumed that sum up to M^2 -1 for M=300 is sum_{m=1}^{299} a_m = \\\\frac{299 \\\\times 300 \\\\times 301}{3} = 8,999,900\\nAnd n=89999 = 90000 -1 = (300)^2 -1\\nAnd s(n) = sum_{k=1}^{90000 -1} ||k|| = sum of a_m for m=1 to 299 = 8,999,900\\nAnd 100 * 89999 = 8,999,900, yes.\\n\\nSo it checks out.\\n\\nTherefore, the smallest such n is 89999.\\n\\nBut let me confirm T(favorable).\\n\\nEarlier I got T(favorable) = 2040\\nT(favorable) - 1940 = 100\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd sum ||k|| from 1 to n divided by n = 100 when n=89999.\\n\\nSo answer is 89999.\",\n    \"answer\": \"89999\"\n}",
