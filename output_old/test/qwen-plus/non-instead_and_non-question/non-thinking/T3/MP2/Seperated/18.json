      "A401": "Trevor and Edward play a game in which they take turns adding or removing beans from a pile. On each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. The player who empties the pile wins. For example, if Trevor goes first with a pile of 5 beans, he can either add 4 to make the total 9, or remove 4 to make the total 1, and either way Edward wins by removing all the beans. There is no limit to how large the pile can grow; it just starts with some finite number of beans in it, say fewer than 1000. Before the game begins, Edward dispatches a spy to find out how many beans will be in the opening pile, call this $n$, then \"graciously\" offers to let Trevor go first. Knowing that the first player is more likely to win, but not knowing $n$, Trevor logically but unwisely accepts, and Edward goes on to win the game. Find a number $n$ less than 1000 that would prompt this scenario, assuming both players are perfect logicians. A correct answer is worth the nearest integer to $\\log _{2}(n-4)$ points."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We are told that Trevor goes first, but Edward wins despite Trevor having the advantage of moving first. This means that the starting number of beans n is a losing position for the first player (Trevor), assuming both players play optimally.\\n\\nThe game rule is: on each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square ≤ current pile size. The player who empties the pile (i.e., reduces it to zero) wins.\\n\\nLet’s denote:\\n- A position is a winning position if the current player can force a win.\\n- A position is a losing position if no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\\n\\nWe need to find an n < 1000 such that the starting position is losing for the first player (Trevor), so Edward wins. We'll simulate or analyze the game states from small n upward to identify losing positions.\\n\\nKey observations:\\n- The largest perfect square ≤ k is floor(sqrt(k))².\\n- From any state k > 0, the player can choose to add or remove s = floor(sqrt(k))², leading to k - s or k + s.\\n- But note: removing s is only valid if k ≥ s (which it always is), and adding s is always allowed.\\n- The goal is to reach 0. So if a player can move to 0, they win.\\n\\nImportant: You win by emptying the pile, i.e., making the pile go to 0. So if you can remove exactly the number of beans in the pile (and that number is a perfect square), you win.\\n\\nBut the rule says: you must add or remove the largest perfect square in the heap. Wait — re-reading: \\\"add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap\\\" — this wording is ambiguous.\\n\\nWait: \\\"the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap\\\" — does this mean the largest perfect square ≤ current count? That makes sense. So at pile size k, the move is to add or remove s = floor(sqrt(k))².\\n\\nSo from k, moves are to k - s or k + s, where s = floor(sqrt(k))².\\n\\nYou win if you make the pile 0. So if k is a perfect square, then s = k, so you can remove k beans and win.\\n\\nTherefore, any perfect square is a winning position: the current player removes all beans and wins.\\n\\nBut wait: suppose k = 4. Then s = 4. Player can remove 4 → 0 and win. So yes, perfect squares are winning.\\n\\nNow consider k = 2. sqrt(2) ≈ 1.41 → s = 1. So moves: remove 1 → 1, or add 1 → 3.\\nFrom 1: s = 1, so next player can remove 1 → 0 and win. So from 2, both moves lead to positions where opponent wins immediately? Let's see:\\n- Move to 1: opponent removes 1 and wins.\\n- Move to 3: s = floor(sqrt(3))² = 1² = 1. Opponent can remove 1 → 2, or add 1 → 4.\\n  But opponent wants to win. From 3, if opponent removes 1 → 2, then it's back to us at 2. But we already saw 2 leads to loss? Not necessarily.\\n\\nWe need to do backward induction.\\n\\nLet’s define f(k) = true if position k is winning for the current player, false otherwise.\\nf(0) is undefined (game over). But reaching 0 wins, so any move to 0 is winning.\\n\\nStart from small k:\\n\\nk = 1: s = 1. Can remove 1 → 0 → win. So f(1) = true.\\nk = 2: s = 1. Moves to 2-1=1 or 2+1=3.\\n  f(1) = true → opponent wins if we go to 1.\\n  Now f(3): compute.\\nk = 3: s = 1. Moves to 2 or 4.\\n  f(2): ?\\n  f(4): s = 4, so can remove 4 → 0 → win. So f(4) = true.\\n  So from 3, moves to 2 (f(2)=?) or 4 (true). If f(2) is false, then moving to 2 would be good. But we don't know f(2).\\n\\nWe need to compute systematically.\\n\\nLet’s compute f(k) for k from 1 up to say 20.\\n\\nk=1: s=1. Moves: 1-1=0 (win), so win. f(1)=true.\\nk=2: s=1. Moves to 1 or 3.\\n  f(1)=true → opponent wins.\\n  f(3): compute.\\nk=3: s=1. Moves to 2 or 4.\\n  f(4): s=4, can remove 4 → 0 → win → f(4)=true.\\n  So from 3, moves to 2 (unknown) or 4 (true). If f(2)=false, then player at 3 can move to 2 and win. But if f(2)=true, then both moves lead to winning positions for opponent → f(3)=false?\\n  Actually: if both moves from 3 lead to positions where opponent wins, then f(3)=false.\\n  But we don’t know f(2) yet.\\n\\nWe need to resolve dependencies. Use dynamic programming with memoization.\\n\\nAlternatively, iterate until convergence, but since moves can increase k, the state space is infinite. However, from a given k, the only relevant states are those reachable via sequences of add/remove, but since we can add, it might go to infinity. But in practice, for a starting n, we only care about positions that can be reached in finite steps.\\n\\nBut note: adding increases the pile, so theoretically infinite, but perhaps we can assume that optimal play avoids unnecessary additions.\\n\\nHowever, sometimes adding might be forced to avoid losing.\\n\\nBut let’s think: if a player is in a losing position, they might try to add to reach a winning position.\\n\\nBut since the pile can grow, we cannot compute all k up to infinity. However, for small n, perhaps the game doesn’t go too high.\\n\\nAlternative idea: look for known patterns or analyze when a position is losing.\\n\\nNote: if k is a perfect square, f(k)=true, because you can remove k and win.\\n\\nWhat about k not a perfect square?\\n\\nLet me try small values:\\n\\nk=1: s=1, remove → 0 → win → f(1)=true\\nk=2: s=1, moves to 1 or 3\\n  f(1)=true → bad\\n  f(3): s=1, moves to 2 or 4\\n    f(4)=true (since 4 is square)\\n    so from 3, if you move to 4, opponent wins; if you move to 2, then opponent is at 2\\n    so f(3) depends on f(2)\\n\\nThis is circular. But we can set up equations.\\n\\nAssume we compute f(k) for k=1,2,3,... in order, but since moves can go to higher k, we may need to go further.\\n\\nBut when we compute f(k), we need f(k-s) and f(k+s). k+s could be larger than current max.\\n\\nSo we need to bound. Perhaps for k up to some limit, say 1000, and assume that beyond that, positions are winning or something, but risky.\\n\\nAlternatively, notice that from k, s = floor(sqrt(k))^2, which is at least (sqrt(k)-1)^2 ≈ k - 2sqrt(k) +1, so s is close to k when k is large.\\n\\nBut let’s try to compute manually for small k, and see if we can find a pattern or a losing position.\\n\\nWe know:\\nf(1) = true (win)\\nf(4) = true (win)\\nf(9) = true, etc.\\n\\nk=2: moves to 1 or 3\\nk=3: moves to 2 or 4\\nSuppose f(2) = false. Then from 3, player can move to 2 (a losing position for opponent), so f(3)=true.\\nThen from 2, moves to 1 (f=true) or 3 (f=true), both winning for opponent, so f(2)=false. Consistent.\\nSo f(2)=false, f(3)=true.\\n\\nk=5: s=floor(sqrt(5))²=2²=4. Moves: 5-4=1 or 5+4=9.\\nf(1)=true, f(9)=true (since 9 is square). So both moves lead to winning positions for opponent → f(5)=false.\\n\\nk=6: s=4 (since sqrt(6)≈2.45, floor=2, s=4). Moves: 6-4=2, 6+4=10.\\nf(2)=false → so moving to 2 puts opponent in losing position → so f(6)=true (because you can move to 2).\\n\\nk=7: s=4. Moves: 7-4=3, 7+4=11.\\nf(3)=true. f(11): compute later.\\n\\nk=8: s=4. Moves: 8-4=4, 8+4=12.\\nf(4)=true. f(12): ?\\n\\nk=9: s=9, can remove 9→0→win → f(9)=true.\\n\\nk=10: s=9? sqrt(10)≈3.16, floor=3, s=9. Moves: 10-9=1, 10+9=19.\\nf(1)=true, f(19)=? \\nIf f(19)=true, then both moves to winning positions for opponent → f(10)=false? Only if both are winning for opponent.\\nBut we need f(19).\\n\\nk=11: s=9. Moves: 11-9=2, 11+9=20.\\nf(2)=false → so moving to 2 is good → f(11)=true.\\n\\nk=12: s=9. Moves: 12-9=3, 12+9=21.\\nf(3)=true. f(21)=?\\n\\nk=13: s=9. Moves: 13-9=4, 13+9=22.\\nf(4)=true. f(22)=?\\n\\nk=14: s=9. Moves: 14-9=5, 14+9=23.\\nf(5)=false → so move to 5 → opponent loses → f(14)=true.\\n\\nk=15: s=9. Moves: 15-9=6, 15+9=24.\\nf(6)=true. f(24)=?\\n\\nk=16: s=16, can remove 16→0→win → f(16)=true.\\n\\nk=17: s=16. Moves: 17-16=1, 17+16=33.\\nf(1)=true. f(33)=?\\n\\nk=18: s=16. Moves: 18-16=2, 18+16=34.\\nf(2)=false → so move to 2 → win → f(18)=true.\\n\\nk=19: s=16? sqrt(19)≈4.35, floor=4, s=16. Moves: 19-16=3, 19+16=35.\\nf(3)=true. f(35)=?\\n\\nk=20: s=16. Moves: 20-16=4, 20+16=36.\\nf(4)=true, f(36)=true (36 is square) → both moves to winning positions → f(20)=false.\\n\\nOh! f(20)=false.\\n\\nIs that right?\\ns=16 for k=20? sqrt(20)≈4.47, floor=4, s=16. Yes.\\nMoves: 20-16=4, f(4)=true → opponent wins.\\n20+16=36, f(36)=true (since 36 is perfect square, opponent removes 36 and wins) → so yes, both moves lead to opponent winning → f(20)=false.\\n\\nSo 20 is a losing position.\\n\\nSimilarly, earlier we had f(5)=false.\\n\\nNow, back to k=10: s=9, moves to 1 or 19.\\nf(1)=true.\\nf(19): s=16, moves to 3 or 35.\\nf(3)=true. f(35): s=25? sqrt(35)≈5.91, floor=5, s=25. Moves: 35-25=10, 35+25=60.\\nf(10): we are computing, but earlier we suspected f(10) might be false.\\n\\nFrom k=10: moves to 1 (f=true) and 19 (f=?).\\nWe have f(19): depends on f(3) and f(35).\\nf(3)=true.\\nf(35): moves to 10 and 60.\\nf(60): s=49? sqrt(60)≈7.74, floor=7, s=49. Moves: 60-49=11, 60+49=109.\\nf(11)=true (from earlier, since it can move to 2, which is losing).\\nf(109): s=100? sqrt(109)≈10.44, floor=10, s=100. Moves: 109-100=9, 109+100=209.\\nf(9)=true, f(209)=? Probably complex.\\nBut from 35, moves to 10 and 60.\\nIf f(10)=false and f(60)=? \\nSuppose f(10)=false, then from 35, player can move to 10 (losing for opponent) → so f(35)=true.\\nThen from 19, moves to 3 (f=true) and 35 (f=true) → both winning for opponent → so f(19)=false.\\nThen from 10, moves to 1 (f=true) and 19 (f=false). Since it can move to 19, which is losing for opponent, so f(10)=true.\\nContradiction: we assumed f(10)=false to get f(35)=true, but now f(10)=true.\\n\\nSo if f(10)=true, then from 35, moves to 10 (f=true) and 60 (f=?).\\nNeed f(60).\\n\\nk=60: s=49. Moves: 60-49=11, 60+49=109.\\nf(11)=true (can move to 2, losing).\\nf(109): s=100. Moves: 109-100=9, 109+100=209.\\nf(9)=true. f(209): s=196? sqrt(209)≈14.45, floor=14, s=196. Moves: 209-196=13, 209+196=405.\\nf(13): s=9, moves to 4 or 22. f(4)=true. f(22): s=16, moves to 6 or 38. f(6)=true. f(38): s=36, moves to 2 or 74. f(2)=false, so f(38)=true (can move to 2). So f(22): moves to 6 (f=true) and 38 (f=true)? Both winning for opponent? Then f(22)=false? Wait.\\nFrom 22: s=16, moves to 22-16=6 or 22+16=38.\\nf(6)=true, f(38)=true → both moves to winning positions for opponent → so f(22)=false.\\nThen f(13): moves to 4 (f=true) and 22 (f=false). So can move to 22, which is losing for opponent → f(13)=true.\\nBack to f(209): moves to 13 (f=true) and 405 (f=?). Complicated.\\n\\nThis is getting messy. But we already have two losing positions: 2,5,20.\\nf(2)=false, f(5)=false, f(20)=false.\\n\\nCheck k=21: s=16? sqrt(21)≈4.58, floor=4, s=16. Moves: 21-16=5, 21+16=37.\\nf(5)=false → so can move to 5 → opponent loses → f(21)=true.\\n\\nk=22: as above, s=16, moves to 6 or 38. f(6)=true, f(38): s=36, moves to 2 or 74. f(2)=false, so f(38)=true (move to 2). So both moves from 22 lead to winning positions for opponent → f(22)=false.\\n\\nSo f(22)=false.\\n\\nSimilarly, k=23: s=16, moves to 7 or 39.\\nf(7): s=4, moves to 3 or 11. f(3)=true, f(11)=true → both winning for opponent? Then f(7)=false? Earlier I didn't compute.\\nFrom 7: moves to 3 (f=true) and 11 (f=true) → yes, both opponents win → f(7)=false.\\nf(39): s=36, moves to 3 or 75. f(3)=true. f(75): s=64? sqrt(75)≈8.66, floor=8, s=64. Moves: 75-64=11, 75+64=139. f(11)=true. f(139): s=121? sqrt(139)≈11.79, floor=11, s=121. Moves: 139-121=18, 139+121=260. f(18)=true (earlier, can move to 2). f(260): complicated, but likely winning. But if f(75) has a move to a losing position, it might be winning.\\nBut from 39, moves to 3 (f=true) and 75 (f=?). If f(75)=true, then both moves are to winning for opponent → f(39)=false.\\nThen from 23, moves to 7 (f=false) and 39 (f=false). So can move to 7 or 39, both losing for opponent → f(23)=true.\\n\\nWe have several losing positions: 2,5,7,20,22,...\\n\\nBut we need n<1000, and Trevor goes first, Edward wins, so n is a losing position.\\n\\nThe problem says: Edward wins, Trevor went first, so n is losing for first player.\\n\\nWe found n=5: in the example, it says if Trevor goes first with 5 beans, he can add 4 to make 9 or remove 4 to make 1. Then Edward wins by removing all. Indeed, from 5, s=4, moves to 1 or 9. f(1)=true, f(9)=true, so whatever Trevor does, Edward wins. So f(5)=false, correct.\\n\\nBut the example says Edward wins, which matches, but it's just an example. The actual n is different, but same behavior.\\n\\nWe need another n<1000 that is losing.\\n\\nEarlier we have 20: f(20)=false.\\nAlso 22: f(22)=false.\\n\\nBut let's confirm f(20):\\n- k=20, s=16 (since 4^2=16<20, 5^2=25>20)\\n- Remove 16: 20-16=4\\n- Add 16: 20+16=36\\n- From 4: player removes 4 and wins\\n- From 36: player removes 36 and wins\\n- So yes, whoever moves from 20, after their move, the opponent wins immediately. So f(20)=false.\\n\\nSimilarly, k=22: s=16, moves to 6 or 38.\\nf(6): s=4, moves to 2 or 10. f(2)=false, so f(6)=true (can move to 2).\\nf(38): s=36 (6^2=36), moves to 38-36=2 or 38+36=74.\\nf(2)=false, so f(38)=true (can move to 2).\\nSo both moves from 22 lead to winning positions for opponent → f(22)=false.\\n\\nNow, are there more? The problem asks for a number n<1000, and then score is nearest integer to log2(n-4).\\n\\nWe have n=5, but probably they want a different one, since 5 is in the example.\\nn=20: log2(20-4)=log2(16)=4, nearest integer 4.\\nn=22: log2(18)≈4.17, nearest integer 4.\\n\\nBut perhaps there are others.\\n\\nEarlier k=7: f(7)=false? From 7, s=4, moves to 3 or 11.\\nf(3)=true (moves to 2 or 4; can move to 2 which is losing, so f(3)=true)\\nf(11)=true (moves to 2 or 20; f(2)=false, so can move to 2, so f(11)=true)\\nSo both moves from 7 lead to winning positions for opponent → f(7)=false.\\nYes.\\nn=7: log2(7-4)=log2(3)≈1.58, nearest integer 2.\\n\\nBut perhaps they want a larger one.\\n\\nWe can find more losing positions.\\n\\nLet me list all k from 1 to 30 and compute f(k), assuming we go in order and compute based on smaller values, but since adding can go higher, we need to go high enough.\\n\\nBut for k up to 1000, we can write a program, but since we're doing by hand, let's continue.\\n\\nWe have:\\nk: f(k)\\n1: T\\n2: F\\n3: T (can move to 2)\\n4: T\\n5: F\\n6: T (to 2)\\n7: F (to 3 or 11, both T)\\n8: s=4, moves to 4 or 12. f(4)=T. f(12): s=9, moves to 3 or 21. f(3)=T, f(21): s=16, moves to 5 or 37. f(5)=F, so f(21)=T (can move to 5). So f(12): moves to 3(T) and 21(T) → both T → f(12)=F? No: if both moves lead to winning for opponent, then current player loses, so f(12)=F.\\nThen from 8, moves to 4(T) and 12(F). Since can move to 12, which is losing for opponent, so f(8)=T.\\n\\nk=9: T\\nk=10: s=9, moves to 1 or 19. f(1)=T. f(19): s=16, moves to 3 or 35. f(3)=T. f(35): s=25, moves to 10 or 60. f(10)=? We are computing. Circular.\\nAssume f(10)=X, f(35)=Y, f(19)=Z.\\nFrom 35: moves to 10(X) and 60(W). If X=F, then Y=T. If W=F, Y=T. Else if both X and W are T, then Y=F.\\nFrom 19: moves to 3(T) and 35(Y). So if Y=F, then Z=T (can move to 35). If Y=T, then both moves to T, so Z=F.\\nFrom 10: moves to 1(T) and 19(Z). So if Z=F, then X=T (can move to 19). If Z=T, then both moves to T, so X=F.\\n\\nSo we have:\\nX = F if Z=T, else T\\nZ = F if Y=T, else T\\nY = F if X=T and W=T, else T  (assuming W=f(60))\\n\\nBut W=f(60) is unknown.\\n\\nf(60): s=49, moves to 11 or 109. f(11)=T (can move to 2). f(109): s=100, moves to 9 or 209. f(9)=T. f(209): s=196, moves to 13 or 405. f(13): s=9, moves to 4 or 22. f(4)=T, f(22)=F (we have), so f(13)=T (can move to 22). So f(209): moves to 13(T) and 405(V). If V=T, then f(209)=F? Only if both moves to T. But if V=F, then f(209)=T. But likely V is T or F, but without knowing, hard.\\n\\nTo simplify, perhaps assume that most positions are winning, and only specific ones are losing.\\n\\nFrom earlier computations, losing positions so far: 2,5,7,20,22\\n\\nk=24: s=16? sqrt(24)≈4.89, s=16. Moves: 24-16=8, 24+16=40.\\nf(8)=T (from earlier). f(40): s=36, moves to 4 or 76. f(4)=T. f(76): s=64, moves to 12 or 140. f(12)=F (from earlier calculation? We had f(12)=F). So f(76)=T (can move to 12). So f(40): moves to 4(T) and 76(T) → both T → f(40)=F.\\nThen from 24, moves to 8(T) and 40(F). Can move to 40, which is losing for opponent → f(24)=T.\\n\\nk=25: s=25, can remove 25→0→win → f(25)=T.\\n\\nk=26: s=25, moves to 1 or 51. f(1)=T. f(51): s=49, moves to 2 or 100. f(2)=F, so f(51)=T (can move to 2). So both moves from 26 to T positions → f(26)=F.\\n\\nOh! f(26)=false.\\nSo 26 is losing.\\nn=26: log2(26-4)=log2(22)≈4.46, nearest integer 4.\\n\\nk=27: s=25, moves to 2 or 52. f(2)=F, so can move to 2 → f(27)=T.\\n\\nk=28: s=25, moves to 3 or 53. f(3)=T. f(53): s=49, moves to 4 or 102. f(4)=T. f(102): s=100, moves to 2 or 202. f(2)=F, so f(102)=T. So f(53): moves to 4(T) and 102(T) → both T → f(53)=F. Then from 28, moves to 3(T) and 53(F). Can move to 53 → f(28)=T.\\n\\nk=29: s=25, moves to 4 or 54. f(4)=T. f(54): s=49, moves to 5 or 103. f(5)=F, so f(54)=T. So both moves to T → f(29)=F.\\n\\nSo f(29)=false.\\nn=29: log2(25)≈4.64, nearest integer 5.\\n\\nk=30: s=25, moves to 5 or 55. f(5)=F, so can move to 5 → f(30)=T.\\n\\nk=31: s=25, moves to 6 or 56. f(6)=T. f(56): s=49, moves to 7 or 105. f(7)=F, so f(56)=T. So both T → f(31)=F.\\n\\nf(31)=false.\\nn=31: log2(27)≈4.75, nearest integer 5.\\n\\nWe have multiple: 2,5,7,20,22,26,29,31,...\\n\\nThe problem is to find one such n<1000. Any will do, but perhaps they expect a specific one, or any is fine.\\n\\nIn the example, n=5 is used, so probably avoid that.\\n\\nThe scoring is nearest integer to log2(n-4), so to maximize points, we want larger n, but since it's just to provide one, and the answer format requires a single number, we can pick one.\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"find a number\\\", so any correct n is acceptable.\\n\\nLet me check if there is a known sequence or pattern.\\n\\nLosing positions: numbers where both possible moves lead to winning positions for the opponent.\\n\\nSince the game allows adding, and the pile can grow, but in practice, for the losing positions we found, they are sparse.\\n\\nAnother one: k=32: s=25, moves to 7 or 57. f(7)=F, so can move to 7 → f(32)=T.\\n\\nk=33: s=25, moves to 8 or 58. f(8)=T. f(58): s=49, moves to 9 or 107. f(9)=T. f(107): s=100, moves to 7 or 207. f(7)=F, so f(107)=T. So f(58): moves to 9(T) and 107(T) → both T → f(58)=F. Then from 33, moves to 8(T) and 58(F) → can move to 58 → f(33)=T.\\n\\nk=34: s=25, moves to 9 or 59. f(9)=T. f(59): s=49, moves to 10 or 108. f(10): earlier we had issue, but let's compute.\\n\\nf(10): s=9, moves to 1 or 19. f(1)=T. f(19): s=16, moves to 3 or 35. f(3)=T. f(35): s=25, moves to 10 or 60. f(10)=? Circular.\\nBut f(35) depends on f(10) and f(60).\\nf(60): s=49, moves to 11 or 109. f(11)=T. f(109): s=100, moves to 9 or 209. f(9)=T. f(209): s=196, moves to 13 or 405. f(13): s=9, moves to 4 or 22. f(4)=T, f(22)=F, so f(13)=T. f(405): very large, but likely there is a move to a losing position, so probably winning. Assume f(405)=T, then f(209): moves to 13(T) and 405(T) → both T → f(209)=F. Then f(109): moves to 9(T) and 209(F) → can move to 209 → f(109)=T. Then f(60): moves to 11(T) and 109(T) → both T → f(60)=F.\\nNow f(35): moves to 10(X) and 60(F). Since can move to 60, which is losing for opponent, so f(35)=T.\\nThen f(19): moves to 3(T) and 35(T) → both T → f(19)=F.\\nThen f(10): moves to 1(T) and 19(F). Can move to 19, which is losing for opponent → f(10)=T.\\nSo f(10)=true.\\n\\nBack to f(59): moves to 10(T) and 108. f(108): s=100, moves to 8 or 208. f(8)=T. f(208): s=196, moves to 12 or 404. f(12): earlier we thought f(12)=F? Let's confirm.\\nf(12): s=9, moves to 3 or 21. f(3)=T. f(21): s=16, moves to 5 or 37. f(5)=F, so f(21)=T. So f(12): moves to 3(T) and 21(T) → both T → f(12)=F. So f(208): moves to 12(F) and 404(U). If U=T, then f(208)=T (can move to 12). So f(108): moves to 8(T) and 208(T) → both T → f(108)=F. Then f(59): moves to 10(T) and 108(F) → can move to 108 → f(59)=T. Then from 34, moves to 9(T) and 59(T) → both T → f(34)=F.\\nSo f(34)=false.\\nn=34: log2(30)≈4.91, nearest integer 5.\\n\\nWe have many: 2,5,7,20,22,26,29,31,34,...\\n\\nAll less than 1000.\\n\\nThe problem likely expects one, and since the scoring depends on n, but for the answer, we just need to provide one n.\\n\\nIn the initial example, n=5 is given, and Edward wins, so similar scenario.\\n\\nBut perhaps they want a different one. Any n that is losing for first player.\\n\\nI recall that in such games, sometimes the losing positions are related to multiples or specific forms.\\n\\nNotice that for k not a perfect square, s = floor(sqrt(k))^2.\\n\\nThe losing positions seem to be those where k - s and k + s are both winning positions.\\n\\nSince we need to output one, and the scoring is log2(n-4), perhaps pick a larger n to have higher score, but the problem doesn't ask to maximize, just to find one.\\n\\nBut in the context, probably any is fine.\\n\\nLet me pick n=20, as it's clean.\\nThen log2(20-4)=log2(16)=4, nearest integer 4.\\n\\nBut the answer is n, not the score. The score is mentioned but we just need to provide n.\\n\\nThe question is to find n, and the score part is just context.\\n\\nSo for Problem 1, answer is n=20, or 26, etc.\\n\\nBut let me verify if there is a constraint I missed.\\n\\nEdward dispatches a spy, knows n, offers Trevor to go first. Trevor accepts, Edward wins. So n is losing for first player.\\n\\nAnd n<1000.\\n\\nAlso, in the example with n=5, it works.\\n\\nSo n=20 is valid.\\n\\nPerhaps they expect the smallest such n greater than 5, or something, but not specified.\\n\\nAnother thought: in the example, for n=5, Trevor has two choices: add 4 to make 9, or remove 4 to make 1. In both cases, Edward wins immediately by removing all.\\nSimilarly for n=20: Trevor must add or remove 16. Remove 16: 4 left, Edward removes 4 and wins. Add 16: 36, Edward removes 36 and wins. Same immediate win.\\nFor n=26: s=25, remove 25: 1 left, Edward removes 1 and wins. Add 25: 51, then Edward can... from 51, s=49, can remove 49 to leave 2, which is losing for Trevor? After Edward moves to 2, then Trevor is at 2, which is losing, so Trevor loses, meaning Edward wins. But not immediate; takes two more moves.\\nBut still, Edward wins.\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nAll are valid.\\n\\nBut perhaps the problem implies that Edward wins quickly, but not stated.\\n\\nI think n=20 is fine.\\n\\nTo be safe, let's pick n=20.\\n\\nBut let me see if there is a well-known answer or pattern.\\n\\nNotice that when k is such that s = m^2, and k - s and k + s are both perfect squares or lead to winning positions.\\n\\nFor k=20, s=16, k-s=4=2^2, k+s=36=6^2, both perfect squares, so next player wins immediately.\\nSimilarly for k=5: s=4, k-s=1=1^2, k+s=9=3^2.\\nk=2: s=1, k-s=1=1^2, k+s=3. 3 is not square, but from 3, as we saw, f(3)=true, so still winning for opponent.\\nBut for k=2, k+s=3, not square, but still winning.\\nk=7: s=4, k-s=3, k+s=11. Neither is square, but both are winning positions.\\nk=22: s=16, k-s=6, k+s=38. 6 and 38 not squares, but f(6)=true, f(38)=true.\\n\\nBut for k where k-s and k+s are both perfect squares, then definitely losing, since next player wins immediately.\\n\\nWhen is k - m^2 and k + m^2 both perfect squares?\\nLet k - m^2 = a^2, k + m^2 = b^2.\\nThen subtracting: (k + m^2) - (k - m^2) = 2m^2 = b^2 - a^2 = (b-a)(b+a)\\nSo 2m^2 = (b-a)(b+a)\\nSet d=b-a, then b+a = 2m^2 / d, and d divides 2m^2.\\nAlso, b = (d + 2m^2/d)/2, a = (2m^2/d - d)/2, must be integers.\\nFor example, m=2, 2*(4)=8. d divides 8, d< b+a.\\nd=1: b+a=8, b-a=1 → 2b=9, b=4.5, not int.\\nd=2: b+a=4, b-a=2 → 2b=6, b=3, a=1. Then k - 4 =1, k=5; k+4=9=3^2. Yes, n=5.\\nd=4: b+a=2, b-a=4 → 2b=6, b=3, a=-1, invalid.\\nd=8: b+a=1, b-a=8 → 2b=9, not int.\\nm=4: 2*16=32. d divides 32.\\nd=2: b+a=16, b-a=2 → 2b=18, b=9, a=7. k - 16 =49? k=65. k+16=81=9^2. Yes.\\nSo n=65.\\nCheck: k=65, s=floor(sqrt(65))^2=8^2=64? sqrt(65)≈8.06, floor=8, s=64.\\nRemove 64: 65-64=1, Edward removes 1 and wins.\\nAdd 64: 65+64=129. Is 129 a perfect square? 11^2=121, 12^2=144, no. But we expected k+s=81? Mistake.\\nFrom earlier: for m=4, we got k - m^2 = a^2, k + m^2 = b^2, with m=4, a=7, b=9.\\nSo k - 16 = 49 → k=65\\nk + 16 = 81 → 65+16=81, yes.\\nBut s is not m^2 in the game; s is floor(sqrt(k))^2.\\nFor k=65, sqrt(65)≈8.06, floor=8, s=64, not 16.\\nOh! I confused m.\\nIn the equation, I used m for the square root, but in the condition, s = floor(sqrt(k))^2, which for k=65 is 64, not 16.\\nSo my m is not the same.\\nIn the derivation, I assumed s=m^2, but for k=65, s=64, not 16.\\nSo the condition is not satisfied.\\nFor k to have s=m^2, and k-s=a^2, k+s=b^2.\\nSo s=m^2, k - m^2 = a^2, k + m^2 = b^2.\\nThen same as before: 2m^2 = b^2 - a^2.\\nFor m=1: 2= b^2 - a^2 = (b-a)(b+a). d=1: b-a=1, b+a=2 → b=1.5, no. d=2: b-a=2, b+a=1, impossible.\\nm=2: 2*4=8. d=2: b-a=2, b+a=4 → b=3,a=1. Then k - 4 =1, k=5; k+4=9. And for k=5, s=floor(sqrt(5))^2=2^2=4, yes. So n=5.\\nm=3: 2*9=18. d divides 18. d=2: b-a=2, b+a=9 → b=5.5, no. d=3: b-a=3, b+a=6 → b=4.5, no. d=1: b-a=1, b+a=18 → b=9.5, no. d=6: b-a=6, b+a=3 → b=4.5, no. d=9: b-a=9, b+a=2 → impossible. d=18: b-a=18, b+a=1 → impossible. No solution.\\nm=4: 2*16=32. d=2: b-a=2, b+a=16 → b=9,a=7. k - 16 =49, k=65. But for k=65, s should be 16, but floor(sqrt(65))^2=64 ≠16. So not applicable.\\nm=5: 2*25=50. d=2: b-a=2, b+a=25 → b=13.5, no. d=5: b-a=5, b+a=10 → b=7.5, no. d=1: b-a=1, b+a=50 → b=25.5, no. d=10: b-a=10, b+a=5 → impossible. No solution.\\nm=6: 2*36=72. d=2: b-a=2, b+a=36 → b=19,a=17. k - 36 = 289, k=325. Check s for k=325: sqrt(325)≈18.02, floor=18, s=324 ≠36. Not equal.\\nSo only when s=m^2, which requires that floor(sqrt(k))=m, so m^2 ≤ k < (m+1)^2.\\nBut k = a^2 + m^2, and k < (m+1)^2, so a^2 + m^2 < m^2 + 2m +1, so a^2 < 2m +1.\\nSimilarly, k = b^2 - m^2 > m^2, so b^2 > 2m^2.\\nFor m=2: a^2 < 4+1=5, a=1 or 2. a=1: k=1+4=5<9, yes. a=2: k=4+4=8<9, but k+s=8+4=12, not square. From earlier, only a=1 gives b=3.\\nFor m=1: a^2 < 2+1=3, a=1. k=1+1=2. k+s=2+1=3, not square. And b^2 = k+s=3, not square.\\nSo only n=5 satisfies that both moves lead to perfect squares.\\nBut there are other losing positions like 20, where moves lead to 4 and 36, both squares, and s=16, but for k=20, floor(sqrt(20))=4, s=16, yes! m=4, s=16.\\nk - s =20-16=4=2^2, k+s=36=6^2.\\nAnd k=20 < (4+1)^2=25, yes.\\na^2 =4, a=2. a^2 < 2m+1=8+1=9, 4<9, yes.\\nb^2=36, b=6. b^2 > 2m^2=2*16=32, 36>32, yes.\\nSo it satisfies.\\nWhy didn't I get it in the equation? For m=4, 2m^2=32. b^2 - a^2=36-4=32, yes. d=b-a=6-2=4. d=4, then b+a=32/4=8. b-a=4, b+a=8 → 2b=12, b=6, a=2. Yes! I missed d=4 earlier.\\nFor m=4, d=4: b-a=4, b+a=8 → b=6,a=2. k - 16 =4, k=20. Yes.\\nSimilarly, d=8: b-a=8, b+a=4 → impossible. d=16: b-a=16, b+a=2 → impossible. d=32: b-a=32, b+a=1 → impossible. d=1,2, etc. as before.\\nSo solutions: m=2,k=5; m=4,k=20.\\nNext m? m=6: 2*36=72. d divides 72, and b-a=d, b+a=72/d, and a,b integers, a^2 < 2*6+1=13, so a<=3.\\nAlso k=a^2 +36 < (6+1)^2=49, so a^2<13, a=1,2,3.\\nd must be such that b=(d + 72/d)/2 integer, a=(72/d - d)/2 integer.\\nd divides 72.\\nd=2: b+a=36, b-a=2 → b=19,a=17, but a=17, a^2=289>13, and k=289+36=325>49, not in range.\\nd=3: b+a=24, b-a=3 → b=13.5, no.\\nd=4: b+a=18, b-a=4 → b=11,a=7, a^2=49>13, k=49+36=85>49.\\nd=6: b+a=12, b-a=6 → b=9,a=3. a=3, a^2=9<13, good. k=9+36=45. Check k<49, yes. s should be 36. floor(sqrt(45))≈6.7, floor=6, s=36, yes. k+s=45+36=81=9^2, good. k-s=45-36=9=3^2, good. So n=45.\\nSimilarly, d=8: b+a=9, b-a=8 → b=8.5, no.\\nd=9: b+a=8, b-a=9 → b=8.5, no.\\nd=12: b+a=6, b-a=12 → b=9,a=-3, invalid.\\nSo n=45.\\nm=8: 2*64=128. a^2 < 2*8+1=17, a<=4. k<81.\\nk=a^2+64<81, so a^2<17, a=1,2,3,4.\\nd divides 128.\\nd=2: b+a=64, b-a=2 → b=33,a=31, too big.\\nd=4: b+a=32, b-a=4 → b=18,a=14, big.\\nd=8: b+a=16, b-a=8 → b=12,a=4. a=4, a^2=16<17, k=16+64=80<81, good. s=floor(sqrt(80))≈8.94, floor=8, s=64, yes. k-s=80-64=16=4^2, k+s=80+64=144=12^2, yes. So n=80.\\nm=10: 2*100=200. a^2<21, a<=4. k<121. k=a^2+100<121, a^2<21, a=1,2,3,4.\\nd divides 200.\\nd=2: b+a=100, b-a=2 → b=51,a=49, too big.\\nd=4: b+a=50, b-a=4 → b=27,a=23, big.\\nd=5: b+a=40, b-a=5 → b=22.5, no.\\nd=8: b+a=25, b-a=8 → b=16.5, no.\\nd=10: b+a=20, b-a=10 → b=15,a=5. a=5, a^2=25>21? 25>21, and k=25+100=125>121, not in range.\\nd=20: b+a=10, b-a=20 → b=15,a=-5, invalid.\\nNo solution for m=10.\\nm=12: 2*144=288. a^2<25, a<=4. k<169. k=a^2+144<169, a^2<25, a=1,2,3,4.\\nd divides 288.\\nd=2: b+a=144, b-a=2 → b=73,a=71, big.\\nd=4: b+a=72, b-a=4 → b=38,a=34, big.\\nd=6: b+a=48, b-a=6 → b=27,a=21, big.\\nd=8: b+a=36, b-a=8 → b=22,a=14, big.\\nd=12: b+a=24, b-a=12 → b=18,a=6. a=6, a^2=36>25, k=36+144=180>169, no.\\nd=16: b+a=18, b-a=16 → b=17,a=1. a=1, a^2=1<25, k=1+144=145<169, good. s=floor(sqrt(145))≈12.04, floor=12, s=144, yes. k-s=145-144=1=1^2, k+s=145+144=289=17^2, yes. So n=145.\\nSimilarly, other m.\\nSo such n include 5,20,45,80,145,...\\nAll less than 1000.\\nNow, the problem might expect one of these, as they are clean losing positions where the next player wins immediately.\\nFor example, n=80: log2(80-4)=log2(76)≈6.25, nearest integer 6.\\nn=145: log2(141)≈7.14, nearest integer 7.\\nBut again, any is fine.\\nSince the example is n=5, perhaps pick n=20.\\nOr to have a different one, n=45.\\nBut I think n=20 is acceptable.\\n\\nNow Problem 2: coloring vertices of a tetrahedron with 3 colors: red, blue, green, such that no face has all three vertices the same color. Two colorings are the same if one can be rotated to the other.\\n\\nA tetrahedron has 4 vertices, 4 faces, each face is a triangle.\\nWe use Burnside's lemma to count distinct colorings under rotation.\\n\\nFirst, total colorings without symmetry: each vertex colored independently, 3^4=81.\\nBut with symmetry and constraint.\\n\\nThe constraint: no face has all three vertices same color.\\nSince each face has three vertices, and if all three are same, it's monochromatic, which is forbidden.\\n\\nBut a tetrahedron has 4 triangular faces. Each set of three vertices forms a face, since it's complete graph K4.\\nVertices A,B,C,D. Faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD. Each omitting one vertex.\\n\\nThe group of rotations of the tetrahedron is A4, alternating group on 4 elements, order 12.\\n\\nBurnside's lemma: number of distinct colorings is (1/|G|) sum_{g in G} Fix(g), where Fix(g) is number of colorings fixed by g that satisfy the constraint.\\n\\nBut the constraint must be satisfied for the coloring to be counted, so we need to count colorings that are fixed by g and satisfy the no-monochromatic-face condition.\\n\\nSince the group acts, and we need the average number of fixed colorings that satisfy the condition.\\n\\nBetter to apply Burnside to the set of colorings satisfying the constraint.\\n\\nSo, list the conjugacy classes of the rotation group of the tetrahedron.\\n\\nThe rotation group is A4, which has 12 elements.\\nConjugacy classes:\\n- Identity: 1 element\\n- Double transpositions (products of two disjoint transpositions): e.g., (AB)(CD), (AC)(BD), (AD)(BC). There are 3 such.\\n- 3-cycles: two types, but in A4, 3-cycles form two conjugacy classes? No, in A4, the 3-cycles split into two classes of size 4 each? Let me recall.\\nStandard: A4 has:\\n- Identity: 1\\n- Double transpositions: 3 elements (as above)\\n- 3-cycles: there are 8 elements of order 3, which split into two conjugacy classes of 4 each: one is (123),(134),(142),(243), and the other is (132),(124),(143),(234), but actually in A4, they are not all conjugate; yes, two classes of 4.\\nBut for Burnside, we need the cycle index, so better to consider the action on vertices.\\n\\nThe group acts on the 4 vertices.\\n\\nTypes of rotations:\\n1. Identity: fixes all colorings. Cycle structure: four 1-cycles.\\n2. Rotations by 180 degrees about an axis through midpoints of opposite edges. These correspond to double transpositions. For example, swap A and B, swap C and D. Cycle structure on vertices: two 2-cycles. There are 3 such rotations (since 3 pairs of opposite edges).\\n3. Rotations by 120 degrees and 240 degrees about an axis through a vertex and the centroid of the opposite face. For each vertex, there are two non-trivial rotations: 120° and 240°. There are 4 vertices, so 8 rotations. Cycle structure: for a vertex fixed, and the other three cycled. So one 1-cycle and one 3-cycle.\\n\\nSo conjugacy classes:\\n- Identity: 1 element, cycle type: (1,1,1,1)\\n- 180° rotations: 3 elements, cycle type: (2,2)\\n- 120° rotations: 8 elements? But 120 and 240 are in different classes? For Burnside, since they have the same cycle structure, we can group them if they have same cycle index, but actually for fixed points, it depends on the cycle structure.\\nFor a rotation with a 3-cycle on three vertices and fixed one, the cycle structure is the same for 120° and 240°: both have one fixed point and one 3-cycle.\\nSo for Burnside, we can group by cycle type.\\nSo:\\n- Type 1: identity, 1 element, cycle structure: four 1-cycles.\\n- Type 2: 180° rotations, 3 elements, cycle structure: two 2-cycles.\\n- Type 3: 120°/240° rotations, 8 elements, cycle structure: one 1-cycle and one 3-cycle.\\n\\nNow, for each type, compute the number of colorings fixed by a rotation of that type that satisfy the no-monochromatic-face condition.\\n\\nFirst, a coloring is fixed by a rotation if it is constant on the cycles of the permutation.\\n\\nType 1: identity. Fixes all colorings. So we need the number of colorings where no face is monochromatic.\\nTotal colorings: 3^4 = 81.\\nSubtract those with at least one monochromatic face.\\nUse inclusion-exclusion.\\nLet A_i be the set where face i is monochromatic.\\nThere are 4 faces.\\n|A_i| = number of colorings where a particular face is mono. Say face ABC is mono. Then A,B,C same color, D arbitrary. So 3 choices for color of A,B,C, 3 for D, so 9.\\nSimilarly for each face, |A_i|=9.\\n|A_i ∩ A_j| for i≠j. Two faces.\\nCase 1: two faces share an edge. E.g., ABC and ABD. They share AB. If both mono, then A,B,C same, A,B,D same, so A=B=C=D, all same color. So only 3 such colorings (all red, all blue, all green).\\nHow many such pairs? Two faces that share an edge. Each pair of faces shares an edge? In tetrahedron, any two faces share an edge? Faces ABC and ABD share AB, ABC and ACD share AC, ABC and BCD share BC, ABD and ACD share AD, ABD and BCD share BD, ACD and BCD share CD. So every pair of faces shares exactly one edge. And there are \\\\binom{4}{2}=6 pairs.\\nFor each such pair, |A_i ∩ A_j| = 3 (all vertices same color).\\nCase 2: but all pairs are covered, since any two faces intersect in an edge.\\nNow, |A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k| for three faces. Say ABC, ABD, ACD. Then ABC mono: A=B=C, ABD mono: A=B=D, ACD mono: A=C=D, so A=B=C=D, all same. Similarly for any three, forces all four same. So |A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k| = 3.\\nNumber of such triplets: \\\\binom{4}{3}=4.\\nFinally, |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3 ∩ A4| = 3 (all same color).\\nBy inclusion-exclusion:\\n|∪ A_i| = Σ|A_i| - Σ|A_i ∩ A_j| + Σ|A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k| - |A1∩A2∩A3∩A4|\\n= 4*9 - 6*3 + 4*3 - 3 = 36 - 18 + 12 - 3 = 27.\\nCompute: 36 - 18 = 18, 18 + 12 = 30, 30 - 3 = 27.\\nSo 27 colorings have at least one monochromatic face.\\nThus, number with no monochromatic face: total - |∪ A_i| = 81 - 27 = 54.\\nBut is that correct? All same color is included, and there are 3 such, each has all four faces monochromatic.\\nBut also, for example, three vertices same, one different. Say A=B=C=red, D=blue. Then face ABC is monochromatic red, but other faces: ABD has A,B red, D blue, not mono; ACD similar; BCD has B,C red, D blue, not mono. So only one monochromatic face. Such colorings: choose which three vertices same: \\\\binom{4}{3}=4 ways, choose color for them: 3, choose color for the single: 2 (different), so 4*3*2=24. Plus the all same: 3. Total with at least one mono face: 24+3=27, yes matches.\\nAnd total such: 27, so good colorings: 81-27=54.\\nBut this includes colorings where a face might be mono, but we subtracted, so 54 have no mono face.\\nBut is there any coloring where no face is mono? For example, two red, two blue. But if the two red are adjacent, say A,B red, C,D blue. Then face ABC: A,B red, C blue, not mono. ABD: A,B red, D blue, not mono. ACD: A red, C,D blue, not mono. BCD: B red, C,D blue, not mono. Good.\\nIf the two red are opposite? In tetrahedron, all vertices are adjacent, no opposites in that sense. Every pair is connected. So any two vertices are adjacent.\\nAnother coloring: all vertices different colors, but only 3 colors, 4 vertices, so by pigeonhole, at least two same color.\\nMinimum number of same color: can have two pairs, or three-one, or four.\\nWe have excluded three-one and four, so only possibilities are: all four same color (excluded), three one color and one another (excluded), or two of one color and two of another, or two of one color, one of second, one of third.\\nIn the two-two case: as above, if the two pairs are not on a face, but since each face has three vertices, it can't be monochromatic unless all three same, which isn't the case. In fact, in any two-two coloring, each face has at least two colors, since only two of each color, and a face has three vertices, so must have at least two colors. Could it be monochromatic? Only if all three same, but we have only two of each, so impossible. So all two-two colorings have no monochromatic face.\\nNumber of two-two colorings: choose two colors out of three: \\\\binom{3}{2}=3 ways. Then partition four vertices into two pairs. Number of ways: \\\\binom{4}{2}/2 = 3 ways? \\\\binom{4}{2}=6 ways to choose first pair, but since the two pairs are indistinct if colors are different, but here colors are assigned to pairs.\\nBetter: choose which color has two vertices: 3 choices (red, blue, or green). Then choose which two vertices get that color: \\\\binom{4}{2}=6. Then the remaining two vertices get the other two colors, but we have two colors left, and two vertices, so assign: 2 ways (which vertex gets which color). So total: 3 * 6 * 2 = 36.\\nBut this counts colorings where two vertices one color, and the other two different colors.\\nBut we also have the case where two vertices color A, two vertices color B, with A≠B.\\nThat is, only two colors used.\\nIn this case, no third color.\\nSo separate cases.\\nCase 1: exactly two colors used.\\nSubcase 1a: one color on three vertices, other on one: but this has a monochromatic face (the three), so excluded.\\nSubcase 1b: two vertices each color. Then as above, no mono face.\\nNumber: choose two colors: \\\\binom{3}{2}=3. Then partition four vertices into two unlabeled pairs? But the colors are assigned, so we need to assign which color to which pair.\\nSo: choose color for first pair: 2 choices (since two colors), but better: after choosing two colors, say red and blue. Then assign to vertices: number of ways to color with two red and two blue: \\\\binom{4}{2}=6 (choose which two red, rest blue). So per pair of colors, 6 colorings. Total: 3 * 6 = 18.\\nCase 2: all three colors used.\\nThen since 4 vertices, must have two vertices of one color, and one each of the other two.\\nSay colors R,B,G. Suppose two red, one blue, one green.\\nNumber: choose which color has two vertices: 3 choices (R,B, or G). Then choose which two vertices get that color: \\\\binom{4}{2}=6. Then assign the other two colors to the remaining two vertices: 2 ways. So 3*6*2=36.\\nTotal good colorings: case 1b + case 2 = 18 + 36 = 54, matches our earlier calculation.\\nGood.\\nSo for identity, Fix(identity) = 54.\\n\\nNow, type 2: 180° rotations, cycle structure two 2-cycles. Example: (A B)(C D).\\nA coloring fixed by this rotation must have A and B same color, and C and D same color.\\nSo let color of A=B be X, color of C=D be Y. X and Y in {R,B,G}.\\nNow, we need no monochromatic face.\\nFaces: ABC: vertices A,B,C. Colors: X,X,Y. This is monochromatic only if X=Y, but even if X=Y, it's X,X,X only if Y=X, but C has color Y, so if X=Y, then A,B,C all color X, so monochromatic. Similarly, if X≠Y, then colors X,X,Y, not all same.\\nSimilarly, face ABD: A,B,D: X,X,Y (since D has Y), same as ABC.\\nFace ACD: A,C,D: X,Y,Y. Monochromatic only if X=Y, then all X.\\nFace BCD: B,C,D: X,Y,Y, same.\\nSo, if X=Y, then all faces are monochromatic (since each face has two of one and one of other, but if X=Y, all same color).\\nIf X≠Y, then no face is monochromatic, because each face has two vertices of one color and one of the other, so not all three same.\\nSo the coloring is good iff X≠Y.\\nNumber of such colorings: X and Y different colors. 3 choices for X, 2 for Y, so 6.\\nSince the rotation is fixed, and we are counting colorings fixed by this rotation, yes.\\nThere are 3 such rotations, but for each, Fix(g) is the same, since symmetric.\\nSo for each 180° rotation, Fix(g) = 6.\\n\\nType 3: 120°/240° rotations, cycle structure: one fixed vertex, and a 3-cycle on the other three.\\nExample: fix A, cycle B->C->D->B. So permutation (B C D).\\nA coloring fixed by this must have B,C,D all the same color, because they are in a 3-cycle, so must be same color for the coloring to be fixed. And A can be any color.\\nSo let color of B=C=D be Y, color of A be X.\\nNow, check faces.\\nFace ABC: A,B,C: colors X,Y,Y. Monochromatic only if X=Y.\\nFace ABD: A,B,D: X,Y,Y. Same, mono if X=Y.\\nFace ACD: A,C,D: X,Y,Y. Same.\\nFace BCD: B,C,D: Y,Y,Y. This is always monochromatic, since all three are color Y.\\nOh! So face BCD is always monochromatic, regardless of X and Y.\\nTherefore, every such coloring has at least one monochromatic face (namely, the face opposite to the fixed vertex, which is BCD in this case).\\nTherefore, there are no good colorings fixed by such a rotation.\\nSo Fix(g) = 0 for each such rotation.\\n\\nNow, sum over g of Fix(g):\\n- Identity: 1 * 54 = 54\\n- 180° rotations: 3 elements * 6 = 18\\n- 120°/240° rotations: 8 elements * 0 = 0\\nTotal sum = 54 + 18 + 0 = 72\\n|G| = 12\\nSo number of distinct colorings = 72 / 12 = 6.\\n\\nIs that possible? Only 6?\\nLet me verify.\\nWe can list them up to symmetry.\\nThe good colorings are those with no monochromatic face.\\nAs above, two types: two-two with two colors, or two-one-one with three colors.\\nFirst, two-two with two colors: say two red, two blue.\\nUnder rotation, all such colorings are equivalent? Not necessarily.\\nFor example, the two red vertices could be adjacent or opposite, but in tetrahedron, all pairs are adjacent, so no opposite vertices. In fact, any two vertices are connected by an edge, so the graph is complete.\\nMoreover, the automorphism group is S4, but rotations are A4, which is transitive on edges, etc.\\nFor two vertices of one color, two of another, since the graph is symmetric, all such partitions are equivalent under rotation.\\nSpecifically, the stabilizer, but anyway, likely only one orbit for each pair of colors.\\nBut we have three choices for which two colors to use.\\nBut since the colors are distinct, different color pairs give different colorings.\\nFor example, red-blue vs red-green.\\nBut under rotation, can we map a red-blue coloring to a red-green? No, because the colors are fixed.\\nRotations permute vertices, not colors.\\nSo the color labels matter.\\nSo for each choice of two colors, and the partition, but as said, all partitions are equivalent.\\nSo for each unordered pair of colors, there is one orbit.\\nBut since the two colors are distinct, and we assign which is which, but in the coloring, the colors are specified.\\nFor a fixed pair of colors, say red and blue, the coloring with two red and two blue: how many such colorings up to rotation?\\nTotal such colorings: as above, \\\\binom{4}{2}=6 for choosing which two red, rest blue.\\nGroup action: rotations act transitively on the set of edges? Or on the set of partitions.\\nThe number of ways to partition four vertices into two pairs.\\nFor example, pair AB and CD, or AC and BD, or AD and BC.\\nThese three partitions.\\nUnder rotation, are they equivalent?\\nIn the tetrahedron, a rotation can map any pair of opposite edges to another.\\nFor example, the rotation (A B)(C D) swaps the pairing AB-CD to itself? It fixes the partition if it preserves the pairs.\\nBut a 120° rotation around A: fixes A, cycles B,C,D. So if we have pair AB and CD, after cycling B->C, C->D, D->B, so AB becomes AC, CD becomes DB, so new pairs AC and BD, which is a different partition.\\nSo the three partitions are in one orbit under rotation.\\nTherefore, for fixed two colors, all colorings with those two colors and two each are in one orbit? Not quite, because we assign colors to pairs.\\nFor example, coloring where AB are red, CD are blue.\\nAfter rotation that swaps to AC and BD, we get AC red, BD blue, which is different.\\nBut since we can rotate, and the group acts, likely all 6 colorings (for fixed colors) are in one orbit? Total 6 colorings, group size 12, but stabilizer.\\nTake a specific coloring: say A,B red, C,D blue.\\nWhat rotations fix this coloring?\\nMust preserve the color classes.\\nSo must map {A,B} to itself, {C,D} to itself.\\nRotations that do this: the 180° rotation (A B)(C D), and identity.\\n(A B)(C D) swaps A and B, swaps C and D, so if A,B same color, C,D same, it preserves.\\nAre there others? A 120° rotation would cycle three vertices, but here only two in each, so cannot.\\nSo stabilizer has order 2: identity and (AB)(CD).\\nThus, orbit size = |G|/|stab| = 12/2 = 6.\\nBut there are only 6 such colorings for fixed colors, so the orbit has all 6 colorings.\\nTherefore, for each pair of colors, there is only one orbit.\\nBut since there are three choices for which two colors to use (RB, RG, BG), so three orbits for the two-two colorings.\\n\\nNow, the other type: three colors used, with two vertices one color, one each of others.\\nSay two red, one blue, one green.\\nTotal such colorings: as above, 36.\\nNow, up to rotation.\\nFix the color distribution: say colors R,B,G with R having two vertices.\\nChoose which two vertices are red: \\\\binom{4}{2}=6 ways.\\nThen assign B and G to the other two: 2 ways.\\nTotal 12 for this color assignment.\\nBut since the colors are asymmetric, we need to consider.\\nNow, under rotation, how many orbits.\\nNote that the two red vertices are adjacent (since all are), and the other two have different colors.\\nNow, the stabilizer.\\nTake a specific coloring: A,B red, C blue, D green.\\nWhat rotations fix this?\\nMust preserve colors, so map red to red, etc.\\nSo must map {A,B} to itself, C to C, D to D? But C and D have different colors, so must fix C and D setwise, but since different colors, must fix each.\\nSo fixes C and D, and swaps or fixes A,B.\\nRotations that fix C and D: but fixing two vertices, in tetrahedron, only identity, because any non-identity rotation moves vertices.\\nFor example, rotation around the axis through C and D? But in tetrahedron, no such axis; rotations are around vertex-face or edge-edge.\\nSpecifically, rotations that fix a vertex: but here we need to fix C and D, two vertices.\\nThe only rotation that fixes two vertices is if they are fixed, but in A4, no rotation fixes two vertices unless it's identity, because a 3-cycle moves three, a 180° swaps two pairs, so if it fixes C and D, then it must fix A and B, so identity.\\nFor example, (A B)(C D) swaps C and D, so doesn't fix.\\nA 120° rotation around A moves B,C,D.\\nSo only identity fixes both C and D.\\nThus, stabilizer is trivial.\\nOrbit size = 12 / 1 = 12.\\nBut for fixed color assignment (R on two, B and G on one each), there are \\\\binom{4}{2} * 2 = 6 * 2 = 12 colorings (choose which two red, then which of the other two gets blue, the other green).\\nSo orbit has all 12, so only one orbit for this color distribution.\\nBut we have chosen which color has two vertices: here red.\\nBut we could have blue having two, or green.\\nSo three choices: which color has two vertices.\\nEach gives a different orbit, since the color with two vertices is distinguished.\\nSo three orbits for this type.\\n\\nTotal orbits: three (from two-two) + three (from two-one-one) = 6.\\nMatches our Burnside count.\\nSo answer is 6.\\n\\nNow back to Problem 1, we need to output n.\\nWe can choose n=20.\\nThen log2(n-4)=log2(16)=4, nearest integer 4, but we don't need to output that.\\nSo for Problem 1, answer is 20.\\n\\nTo confirm, with n=20, Trevor goes first, must add or remove s=16 (since floor(sqrt(20))=4, s=16). Remove 16: leaves 4, Edward removes 4 and wins. Add 16: leaves 36, Edward removes 36 and wins. So Edward wins, perfect.\\n\\nSo final answers.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"20\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
