Then $f(x) = f(y) = f(z)$.\\n\\nNow, consider when $f(a) = f(b)$. Then:\\n$$\\na - \\\\frac{1}{a} = b - \\\\frac{1}{b}\\n$$\\nMultiply both sides by $ab$:\\n$$\\na^2b - b = ab^2 - a\\n$$\\n$$\\na^2b - ab^2 = b - a\\n$$\\n$$\\nab(a - b) = -(a - b)\\n$$\\nIf $a \\\\ne b$, divide both sides by $a - b$:\\n$$\\nab = -1\\n$$\\nSo either $a = b$ or $ab = -1$.\\n\\nTherefore, for each pair among $x, y, z$, either they are equal or their product is $-1$.\\n\\nBut since $f(x) = f(y) = f(z)$, all three values satisfy the same functional value.\\n\\nLet’s suppose $x = y = z$. Try this symmetric case first.\\n\\nAssume $x = y = z$. Then from any equation, say:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{x} + x + x = 3 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{x} + 2x = 3\\n$$\\nMultiply by $x$:\\n$$\\n1 + 2x^2 = 3x \\\\Rightarrow 2x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0\\n$$\\nSolve:\\n$$\\nx = \\\\frac{3 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{9 - 8}}{4} = \\\\frac{3 \\\\pm 1}{4} \\\\Rightarrow x = 1, \\\\frac{1}{2}\\n$$\\nSo possible solutions: $x = 1$ → then $x+y+z = 3$\\nOr $x = \\\\frac{1}{2}$ → sum = $3 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3}{2}$\\n\\nBut check if both satisfy original equation.\\n\\nCase 1: $x = y = z = 1$\\nThen $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$: good.\\n\\nCase 2: $x = y = z = \\\\frac{1}{2}$\\nThen $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = 2 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 3$: also good.\\n\\nSo two solutions so far: sum = 3 and $\\\\frac{3}{2}$\\n\\nBut are there more?\\n\\nRecall: $f(x) = f(y) = f(z)$, but not necessarily all equal.\\nSuppose not all equal. Then for some pair, say $x \\\\ne y$, then $xy = -1$\\nSimilarly, if $y \\\\ne z$, then $yz = -1$, etc.\\n\\nLet’s suppose $x \\\\ne y$, so $xy = -1$\\nAnd $y \\\\ne z$, so $yz = -1$\\nThen from $xy = -1$, $x = -1/y$\\nFrom $yz = -1$, $z = -1/y$\\nSo $x = z = -1/y$\\n\\nNow use one of the equations.\\nUse equation (1): $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = 3$\\nWe have $x = -1/y$, so $\\\\frac{1}{x} = -y$\\n$z = -1/y$\\nSo:\\n$$\\n-y + y + (-1/y) = -\\\\frac{1}{y} = 3 \\\\Rightarrow y = -\\\\frac{1}{3}\\n$$\\nThen $x = -1/y = 3$, $z = -1/y = 3$\\nSo $x = 3, y = -1/3, z = 3$\\n\\nNow verify all three equations:\\n\\n1. $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{3} - \\\\frac{1}{3} + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3$: good\\n2. $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = 3 + (-3) + 3 = 3$: good\\n3. $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 3 - \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{3} = 3$: good\\n\\nSo valid solution! Sum: $x+y+z = 3 - 1/3 + 3 = 6 - 1/3 = 17/3$\\n\\nWait: $x=3, y=-1/3, z=3$, so sum = $3 + 3 - 1/3 = 6 - 1/3 = 17/3$\\n\\nNow, is this symmetric? We assumed $x \\\\ne y$, $y \\\\ne z$, got $x=z=3$, $y=-1/3$\\n\\nBut maybe other permutations?\\n\\nNote: in this solution, two variables are equal (x and z), and the third different.\\n\\nCould we have all three distinct?\\nSuppose $x, y, z$ all different.\\nThen $xy = -1$, $yz = -1$, $zx = -1$?\\nFrom $xy = -1$, $yz = -1$ ⇒ $x = z$, contradiction.\\nSo cannot have all three distinct.\\n\\nThus possibilities:\\n- All three equal: we had $x=y=z=1$ → sum=3; $x=y=z=1/2$ → sum=3/2\\n- Two equal, one different\\n\\nIn previous case, we had $x=z=3$, $y=-1/3$\\nBut could have other assignments?\\n\\nLet’s suppose $x = y$, $z$ different.\\nThen from $f(x) = f(z)$, either $x=z$ (back to all equal) or $xz = -1$\\nSo assume $x = y$, $xz = -1$ ⇒ $z = -1/x$\\n\\nNow use equations.\\nUse equation (1): $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{x} + x + (-1/x) = x = 3$\\nSo $x = 3$\\nThen $y = x = 3$, $z = -1/3$\\nNow check equation (2): $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = 3 + 1/3 - 1/3 = 3$: good\\nEquation (3): $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 3 + 3 + (-3) = 3$: good\\nSo another solution: $x=3, y=3, z=-1/3$, sum = $3+3-1/3 = 17/3$\\nSame sum.\\n\\nSimilarly, if $y = z$, $x$ different.\\nThen $f(y) = f(x)$ ⇒ $x = y$ or $xy = -1$\\nAssume $xy = -1$, and $y = z$\\nUse equation (3): $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = x + y + \\\\frac{1}{y} = 3$\\nBut $x = -1/y$, so:\\n$-1/y + y + 1/y = y = 3$ ⇒ $y=3$\\nThen $z = y = 3$, $x = -1/3$\\nCheck:\\n(1): $1/x + y + z = -3 + 3 + 3 = 3$: good\\n(2): $x + 1/y + z = -1/3 + 1/3 + 3 = 3$: good\\n(3): $x + y + 1/z = -1/3 + 3 + 1/3 = 3$: good\\nSum: $-1/3 + 3 + 3 = 17/3$\\n\\nSo in all asymmetric cases, sum is $17/3$\\n\\nNow, are there more?\\nWe already considered all equal: sums $3$ and $3/2$\\nAnd two equal, one different: gives sum $17/3$\\n\\nBut wait: in the all-equal case, we solved $\\\\frac{1}{x} + 2x = 3$ and got $x=1, 1/2$\\nBut are there other solutions where two variables are equal but not covered?\\nWe just did: when two equal, and the third related by product -1, we got solutions with sum $17/3$\\n\\nNow, total possible values of $x+y+z$: $3$, $3/2$, and $17/3$\\n\\nBut wait — are these all distinct?\\n$3 = 3$, $3/2 = 1.5$, $17/3 \\\\approx 5.666$\\nYes.\\n\\nBut let’s list all solutions we found:\\n1. $x=y=z=1$ → sum = 3\\n2. $x=y=z=0.5$ → sum = 1.5 = 3/2\\n3. $x=3, y=-1/3, z=3$ → sum = 17/3\\n4. $x=3, y=3, z=-1/3$ → sum = 17/3\\n5. $x=-1/3, y=3, z=3$ → sum = 17/3\\n\\nBut these are different triples, but same sum $17/3$\\nSo only three possible sums? No: only three distinct sums: $3/2, 3, 17/3$\\n\\nBut wait — is there a solution where two variables are $1/2$ and one different?\\nTry assuming $x=y=a$, $z=b$, $a \\\\ne b$, so $ab = -1$?\\nFrom earlier logic: since $f(a)=f(b)$, and $a \\\\ne b$, then $ab=-1$\\nSo $b = -1/a$\\nNow use an equation.\\nUse equation (1): $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{a} + a + b = \\\\frac{1}{a} + a - \\\\frac{1}{a} = a = 3$\\nSo $a=3$, as before.\\nNo choice.\\nSo only possibility when two equal and one different is when the equal ones are 3, the different one is -1/3.\\n\\nSo no solution with two 1/2's.\\n\\nThus, only three types:\\n- All 1: sum = 3\\n- All 1/2: sum = 3/2\\n- Two 3's and one -1/3: sum = 3+3-1/3 = 17/3\\n\\nBut is there a solution with two -1/3 and one 3?\\nSuppose $x = y = -1/3$, $z$ different.\\nThen $f(x) = f(z)$, $x \\\\ne z$ ⇒ $xz = -1$ ⇒ $z = -1/x = 3$\\nNow check equation (1): $1/x + y + z = -3 + (-1/3) + 3 = -1/3 \\\\ne 3$\\nNot satisfied.\\nSo invalid.\\n\\nOnly when the *different* variable is the one whose reciprocal appears in the term with the single reciprocal.\\nBut in our earlier derivation, when we set two equal, we used the equation where the different variable is not the one in the reciprocal, and it forced the equal variables to be 3.\\n\\nSo only the cases we found.\\n\\nBut wait: in the all-equal case, we have two solutions.\\nIn the two-equal case, we have sum 17/3.\\n\\nSo possible sums: $ \\\\frac{3}{2}, 3, \\\\frac{17}{3} $\\n\\nBut the problem says “the sum of all possible values of $x+y+z$”\\nSo add them: $ \\\\frac{3}{2} + 3 + \\\\frac{17}{3} $\\n\\nCompute:\\nCommon denominator 6:\\n$ \\\\frac{9}{6} + \\\\frac{18}{6} + \\\\frac{34}{6} = \\\\frac{61}{6} $\\n\\nBut wait — is that correct?\\nAre all these sums actually achievable?\\nWe have:\\n- $x=y=z=1$: satisfies all equations: yes\\n- $x=y=z=1/2$: $1/x + y + z = 2 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 3$: yes\\n- $x=3,y=-1/3,z=3$: checked, yes\\nAnd permutations give same sum.\\n\\nSo three distinct values: $3/2, 3, 17/3$\\n\\nBut 17/3 appears in multiple triples, but it's one value.\\nSo set of possible values: $\\\\left\\\\{ \\\\frac{3}{2}, 3, \\\\frac{17}{3} \\\\right\\\\}$\\nSum: $ \\\\frac{3}{2} + 3 + \\\\frac{17}{3} = \\\\frac{9 + 18 + 34}{6} = \\\\frac{61}{6} $\\n\\nNow, $m=61, n=6$, gcd(61,6)=1 since 61 prime.\\nThen $100m + n = 100\\\\cdot61 + 6 = 6100 + 6 = 6106$\\n\\nBut wait — let me double-check if $x=y=z=1/2$ really satisfies all.\\nGiven:\\n$\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{0.5} + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2 + 1 = 3$: good\\n$x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = 0.5 + 2 + 0.5 = 3$: good\\n$x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 0.5 + 0.5 + 2 = 3$: good\\nYes.\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nBut is there a constraint that $x,y,z \\\\ne 0$? Yes, because we have $1/x$ etc., so implicitly nonzero, which they are.\\n\\nSo sum of all possible values of $x+y+z$ is $ \\\\frac{3}{2} + 3 + \\\\frac{17}{3} = \\\\frac{61}{6} $\\nThus $m=61, n=6$, $100m+n=6106$\\n\\nBut I recall that in some similar problems, sometimes solutions are repeated or invalid.\\nLet me see if there are only three distinct sums.\\n\\nAlternatively, let’s solve systematically.\\n\\nSet:\\nLet $ a = x, b = y, c = z $\\nWe have:\\n$ \\\\frac{1}{a} + b + c = 3 $  (1)\\n$ a + \\\\frac{1}{b} + c = 3 $  (2)\\n$ a + b + \\\\frac{1}{c} = 3 $  (3)\\n\\nSubtract (1)-(2):\\n$ (\\\\frac{1}{a} - a) + (b - \\\\frac{1}{b}) = 0 $\\n⇒ $ \\\\frac{1}{a} - a = \\\\frac{1}{b} - b $\\nWait, earlier I had $ a - 1/a = b - 1/b $, but sign?\\nFrom (2)-(1):\\n$ (a - 1/a) + (1/b - b) = 0 $\\nSo $ a - 1/a = b - 1/b $, same as before.\\n\\nSet $ u = a - \\\\frac{1}{a} $, $ v = b - \\\\frac{1}{b} $, $ w = c - \\\\frac{1}{c} $\\nFrom pairwise subtractions, $ u = v = w $\\nSo $ a - 1/a = b - 1/b = c - 1/c = k $, say.\\n\\nSo each variable satisfies $ t - 1/t = k $\\nMultiply by t: $ t^2 - 1 = kt $ ⇒ $ t^2 - kt - 1 = 0 $\\nSo for each of $a,b,c$, they are roots of $ t^2 - kt - 1 = 0 $\\nThis quadratic has two roots: $ \\\\frac{k \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{k^2 + 4}}{2} $\\nSo each of $a,b,c$ is one of these two roots.\\nLet the roots be $ r = \\\\frac{k + \\\\sqrt{k^2+4}}{2} $, $ s = \\\\frac{k - \\\\sqrt{k^2+4}}{2} $\\nNote that $ r s = -1 $, from constant term.\\n\\nSo indeed, any two distinct values multiply to -1.\\n\\nNow, $a,b,c$ each is either $r$ or $s$.\\nNow plug into one equation.\\nTake equation (1): $ \\\\frac{1}{a} + b + c = 3 $\\nBut $ \\\\frac{1}{a} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{1}{r} & a=r \\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{s} & a=s \\\\end{cases} $\\nBut since $ r s = -1 $, $ \\\\frac{1}{r} = -s $, $ \\\\frac{1}{s} = -r $\\nBecause $ r s = -1 $ ⇒ $ 1/r = -s $, $ 1/s = -r $\\n\\nSo $ \\\\frac{1}{a} = \\\\begin{cases} -s & \\\\text{if } a=r \\\\\\\\ -r & \\\\text{if } a=s \\\\end{cases} $\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nNow, let’s consider cases based on how many of $a,b,c$ are $r$ or $s$.\\n\\nCase 1: all three equal.\\nSubcase 1a: $a=b=c=r$\\nThen $ \\\\frac{1}{a} + b + c = \\\\frac{1}{r} + r + r = -s + 2r $\\nBut $ s = \\\\frac{k - \\\\sqrt{k^2+4}}{2} $, $ r = \\\\frac{k + \\\\sqrt{k^2+4}}{2} $\\nNote that $ r + s = k $, $ r - s = \\\\sqrt{k^2+4} $\\nAnd $ -s + 2r = 2r - s $\\nSet equal to 3.\\nSince $ r s = -1 $, and $ a=b=c=r $, from earlier we know $ \\\\frac{1}{r} + 2r = 3 $\\nBut $ \\\\frac{1}{r} = -s $, so $ -s + 2r = 3 $\\nSimilarly, since $ r + s = k $, but perhaps solve:\\n$ 2r - s = 3 $\\nBut $ s = -1/r $, so $ 2r - (-1/r) = 2r + 1/r = 3 $\\nMultiply by r: $ 2r^2 + 1 = 3r $ ⇒ $ 2r^2 - 3r + 1 = 0 $\\nAs before, $ r = 1 $ or $ 1/2 $\\nIf $ r=1 $, $ s = -1/r = -1 $\\nIf $ r=1/2 $, $ s = -2 $\\nNow check if consistent: if $ r=1 $, then $ k = r - 1/r = 1 - 1 = 0 $? Wait no\\n$ k = t - 1/t $, for t=r=1, k=1-1=0\\nFor t=1/2, k=0.5 - 2 = -1.5\\nBut if all are r, and r=1, then a=b=c=1, which we know works.\\nIf r=1/2, a=b=c=1/2, works.\\nNow, if all are s?\\nSubcase 1b: a=b=c=s\\nThen $ \\\\frac{1}{a} + b + c = \\\\frac{1}{s} + s + s = -r + 2s $\\nSet to 3: $ 2s - r = 3 $\\nBut $ r = -1/s $, so $ 2s - (-1/s) = 2s + 1/s = 3 $\\nMultiply by s: $ 2s^2 + 1 = 3s $ ⇒ $ 2s^2 - 3s + 1 = 0 $\\nSame as before, s=1 or 1/2\\nIf s=1, then r=-1, a=b=c=1, same as before\\nIf s=1/2, r=-2, a=b=c=1/2, same\\nSo no new solutions.\\n\\nCase 2: two are r, one is s.\\nWithout loss of generality, suppose a=r, b=r, c=s\\nNow compute equation (1): $ \\\\frac{1}{a} + b + c = \\\\frac{1}{r} + r + s = -s + r + s = r $\\nSet equal to 3: so $ r = 3 $\\nThen since $ r s = -1 $, $ s = -1/3 $\\nNow check if satisfies.\\na=r=3, b=r=3, c=s=-1/3\\nNow equation (1): $1/a + b + c = 1/3 + 3 - 1/3 = 3$: good\\nEquation (2): $a + 1/b + c = 3 + 1/3 - 1/3 = 3$: good\\nEquation (3): $a + b + 1/c = 3 + 3 + (-3) = 3$: good\\nGood.\\nSum: 3+3-1/3=17/3\\n\\nNow, other subcases: two r, one s, but different positions.\\nSuppose a=r, b=s, c=r\\nThen equation (1): $1/a + b + c = 1/r + s + r = -s + s + r = r = 3$\\nSame, r=3, s=-1/3\\na=3, b=-1/3, c=3\\nSum same 17/3\\nSimilarly, a=s, b=r, c=r: then eq(1): 1/a + b + c = 1/s + r + r = -r + 2r = r = 3\\nAgain r=3, s=-1/3\\na=-1/3, b=3, c=3\\nSum still 17/3\\n\\nNow Case 3: one r, two s.\\nSuppose a=r, b=s, c=s\\nThen equation (1): $1/a + b + c = 1/r + s + s = -s + 2s = s$\\nSet to 3: s=3\\nThen r = -1/s = -1/3\\nNow a=r=-1/3, b=s=3, c=s=3\\nNow check equations:\\n(1): 1/a + b + c = 1/(-1/3) + 3 + 3 = -3 + 6 = 3: good\\n(2): a + 1/b + c = -1/3 + 1/3 + 3 = 3: good\\n(3): a + b + 1/c = -1/3 + 3 + 1/3 = 3: good\\nSame as before! This is the same triple as when two r and one s, just relabeled.\\nIn fact, since r and s are symmetric in a way, but here when we set s=3, r=-1/3, and a=r=-1/3, b=c=s=3, so it's the same as previous cases.\\nSum still 17/3\\n\\nSimilarly for other permutations.\\n\\nSo all non-symmetric solutions give sum 17/3\\n\\nAnd symmetric give 3 and 3/2\\n\\nSo possible sums: $ \\\\frac{3}{2}, 3, \\\\frac{17}{3} $\\n\\nSum of these values: $ \\\\frac{3}{2} + 3 + \\\\frac{17}{3} = \\\\frac{9}{6} + \\\\frac{18}{6} + \\\\frac{34}{6} = \\\\frac{61}{6} $\\n\\nThus $ m=61, n=6 $, $ \\\\gcd(61,6)=1 $\\n$ 100m + n = 6100 + 6 = 6106 $\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nRegular polygons: ICAO, VENTI, ALBEDO\\nNames: ICAO, VENTI, ALBEDO\\nThese are 4-gon, 6-gon, 6-gon? Count letters.\\nICAO: I,C,A,O → 4 vertices → regular quadrilateral, i.e., square\\nVENTI: V,E,N,T,I → 5 letters? V-E-N-T-I, that's 5\\nBut VENTI might be Italian for twenty, but letters: V,E,N,T,I — 5 distinct?\\nBut polygon with vertices V,E,N,T,I — so pentagon?\\nBut it says regular polygon, so must be regular pentagon.\\nALBEDO: A,L,B,E,D,O — 6 letters → regular hexagon.\\n\\nBut ICAO has 4 letters: I,C,A,O — so square.\\nVENTI: V,E,N,T,I — 5 letters — regular pentagon.\\nALBEDO: A,L,B,E,D,O — 6 letters — regular hexagon.\\n\\nThey lie on a plane. Given IN = 1, compute number of possible values of ON.\\n\\nPoints: from the names, the vertices are labeled.\\nSo polygon ICAO: vertices I,C,A,O in some order. Since it's a polygon, probably cyclic order.\\nSimilarly, VENTI: V,E,N,T,I\\nALBEDO: A,L,B,E,D,O\\n\\nNote that some points are shared: I is in ICAO and VENTI\\nA is in ICAO and ALBEDO\\nE is in VENTI and ALBEDO\\nO is in ICAO and ALBEDO\\nN is in VENTI only? And T,V,L,B,D,C are others.\\n\\nBut we need distance IN and ON.\\nI and N are both in VENTI, since VENTI has I and N.\\nO is in ICAO and ALBEDO.\\n\\nGiven IN = 1, find possible values of ON.\\n\\nSince the polygons are regular and share vertices, their relative positions matter.\\n\\nFirst, list all points involved:\\n- From ICAO: I,C,A,O\\n- From VENTI: V,E,N,T,I\\n- From ALBEDO: A,L,B,E,D,O\\n\\nSo total points: I,C,A,O,V,E,N,T,L,B,D\\nBut some overlaps: I,A,O,E appear in multiple.\\nUnique points: I,C,A,O,V,E,N,T,L,B,D — 11 points.\\n\\nBut we care about distances between I,N,O.\\n\\nNote that I and N are both vertices of the regular pentagon VENTI.\\nSimilarly, O is a vertex of square ICAO and hexagon ALBEDO.\\n\\nBut to find ON, we need positions.\\n\\nThe key is that the polygons share vertices, so the entire figure is embedded in the plane with these regular polygons sharing the labeled vertices.\\n\\nSpecifically:\\n- Square ICAO: so points I,C,A,O form a square.\\n- Regular pentagon VENTI: points V,E,N,T,I form a regular pentagon.\\n- Regular hexagon ALBEDO: points A,L,B,E,D,O form a regular hexagon.\\n\\nShared points: I (in square and pentagon), A (in square and hexagon), E (in pentagon and hexagon), O (in square and hexagon).\\n\\nSo the three polygons are connected through these shared vertices.\\n\\nWe are given distance IN = 1.\\nI and N are both in the pentagon VENTI.\\nIn a regular pentagon with side length s, the diagonal length is $ s \\\\phi $, where $ \\\\phi = \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2} $, but here IN might be a side or a diagonal, depending on the labeling.\\n\\nThe labeling suggests the order around the polygon.\\nFor polygon ICAO, likely the vertices are in order I-C-A-O or I-O-A-C, etc.\\nTypically, polygons are named in cyclic order.\\nSo assume that for each polygon, the vertices are listed in order around the polygon.\\n\\nSo for square ICAO: order I → C → A → O → I\\nSo edges: IC, CA, AO, OI\\nSimilarly, pentagon VENTI: V→E→N→T→I→V\\nEdges: VE, EN, NT, TI, IV\\nHexagon ALBEDO: A→L→B→E→D→O→A\\nEdges: AL, LB, BE, ED, DO, OA\\n\\nNow, we need to find distance IN.\\nI and N are in the pentagon.\\nFrom the cycle: V-E-N-T-I-V\\nSo path from N to I: N→T→I, so two edges apart.\\nIn a pentagon, vertices two apart are connected by a diagonal.\\nThe chord spanning two edges.\\nIn regular pentagon, the diagonal length is $ s \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2} = s \\\\phi $, where s is side length.\\nHere, the side length of pentagon is, say, p.\\nDistance from N to I: N to T is one edge, T to I is next, so N and I are separated by two edges, so it's a diagonal, length $ p \\\\phi $\\nGiven IN = 1, so $ p \\\\phi = 1 $, so $ p = 1 / \\\\phi = \\\\phi - 1 = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2} $\\nBut actually, $ \\\\phi = \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2} $, so $ 1/\\\\phi = \\\\frac{2}{1+\\\\sqrt{5}} = \\\\frac{2(\\\\sqrt{5}-1)}{4} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2} $\\nYes.\\nBut is IN necessarily a diagonal? In pentagon V-E-N-T-I, from N to I: N to T to I, so skipping one vertex, so yes, diagonal.\\nThe other possibility: if the polygon is traversed in opposite direction, but usually naming implies order.\\nBut to be safe, in a regular pentagon, the distances between vertices are either side length or diagonal length.\\nAdjacent vertices: distance s\\nVertices two apart: distance d = s φ\\nSince pentagon has odd number, no diameter.\\nNow, in the sequence V-E-N-T-I, the neighbors of N are E and T.\\nNeighbors of I are T and V.\\nSo I and N are not adjacent; they are both adjacent to T, so they are at distance 2 along the polygon, so diagonal.\\nSo IN is diagonal, so |IN| = d = s_pentagon * φ\\nSet to 1, so s_pentagon = 1/φ\\n\\nNow, we need to find ON, where O is another point.\\nO is in square ICAO and hexagon ALBEDO.\\nTo find distance from O to N, we need their relative positions, which depend on how the polygons are attached.\\n\\nThe attachment is through shared vertices: I, A, E, O.\\nSpecifically:\\n- Square and pentagon share vertex I\\n- Square and hexagon share vertices A and O\\n- Pentagon and hexagon share vertex E\\n\\nSo the three polygons are connected: square shares I with pentagon, shares A and O with hexagon, and pentagon shares E with hexagon.\\n\\nTo determine the configuration, we need to know the orientations and positions.\\nSince they are regular polygons, once we fix the position and orientation of one, others are determined by the shared vertices, but there might be multiple ways to attach.\\n\\nMoreover, for each shared vertex, the relative angles might allow different configurations.\\n\\nSpecifically, at each shared vertex, the polygons can be on different sides.\\n\\nBut since it's a plane, and polygons are rigid, we need to see the possible embeddings.\\n\\nNote that points A, I, O are in the square ICAO.\\nSince it's a square, and vertices in order I-C-A-O.\\nSo going I to C to A to O to I.\\nSo the vectors: from I to C, C to A, A to O, O to I.\\nIn a square, consecutive edges perpendicular.\\nSpecifically, the angle at each vertex is 90 degrees.\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nNow, we need to relate the positions.\\n\\nPerhaps fix one polygon and build others.\\n\\nBut it might be better to consider the graph of connections.\\n\\nSince we need distance ON, and we know IN=1, and both N and O are connected through the network.\\n\\nList the points and relations.\\n\\nDenote the side lengths.\\nLet:\\ns_s = side length of square ICAO\\ns_p = side length of pentagon VENTI\\ns_h = side length of hexagon ALBEDO\\n\\nFrom earlier, in pentagon, IN is a diagonal.\\nIn regular pentagon, diagonal d = s_p * φ, where φ = (1+√5)/2\\nGiven |IN| = 1, so s_p * φ = 1 ⇒ s_p = 1/φ = φ - 1 = (√5 - 1)/2\\n\\nNow, in the square ICAO, with vertices I,C,A,O in order.\\nThe distance between I and A: in the square, I to C to A, so diagonal of the square.\\nSince it's a square, diagonal is s_s * √2\\nSimilarly, distance from I to O: in the cycle I-C-A-O-I, so I to O is adjacent? From I to O directly? The edges are IC, CA, AO, OI, so yes, OI is an edge, so |OI| = s_s\\nSimilarly, |IA| = distance across, which is diagonal, s_s √2\\n\\nIn hexagon ALBEDO: A-L-B-E-D-O-A\\nSo edges AL, LB, BE, ED, DO, OA\\nSo |OA| is an edge, so |OA| = s_h\\n|AE|: A to L to B to E, so three steps, but in hexagon, opposite vertices.\\nRegular hexagon has diameter 2 s_h, since it's composed of equilateral triangles.\\nDistance between A and E: positions.\\nLabel hexagon vertices in order: A, L, B, E, D, O, back to A.\\nSo from A to E: A→L→B→E, so three steps, so opposite vertex.\\nIn regular hexagon, distance between opposite vertices is 2 s_h\\nSimilarly, |A to D| would be two steps, etc.\\n\\nNow, shared points:\\n- I: in square and pentagon\\n- A: in square and hexagon\\n- O: in square and hexagon\\n- E: in pentagon and hexagon\\n\\nAt each shared vertex, the two polygons meet, and the angle between them might vary, but since they are planar and share only the vertex, not necessarily an edge, so they can rotate around that vertex.\\nHowever, because multiple polygons share vertices, and we have chains, the relative positions might be constrained.\\n\\nSpecifically, consider the path from I to O.\\nIn the square, I and O are adjacent, since OI is an edge, so |IO| = s_s\\nSimilarly, in the square, I and A are diagonal, |IA| = s_s √2\\n\\nNow, O is also in hexagon, and A is in hexagon, and in hexagon, A and O are connected by an edge? From A to L to ... to O, but in the cycle A-L-B-E-D-O-A, so A to O is not direct; the edges are OA, so yes, O to A is an edge, so |OA| = s_h\\n\\nSo in the hexagon, |OA| = s_h\\nBut in the square, |OA| is also a distance: in square I-C-A-O, from O to A: O to I to C to A? Or directly? The vertices are O and A, and in the cycle, after O is I, before O is A? Order I-C-A-O-I, so from A to O is an edge? A to O: in sequence, after A is O? I-C-A-O, so yes, A to O is an edge, so |AO| = s_s\\n\\nOh! So in square ICAO, A and O are adjacent, so |AO| = s_s\\nBut in hexagon ALBEDO, A and O are also adjacent (since OA is an edge), so |AO| = s_h\\nTherefore, s_s = s_h\\nBecause both equal to |AO|\\nSo the side length of the square equals the side length of the hexagon.\\nLet s = s_s = s_h\\nThen |AO| = s\\nAlso, in square, |IO| = s (since adjacent), |IA| = s√2\\nIn hexagon, |OA| = s, |OE| = ? From O to E: O to D to E? Cycle: ...D-O-A-L-B-E..., so from O to E: O→A→L→B→E, four steps, or O→D→E, two steps? After O is A, before O is D? Sequence: A-L-B-E-D-O-A, so order: A,L,B,E,D,O, then back to A.\\nSo neighbors of O: D and A\\nNeighbors of E: B and D\\nSo from O to E: O to D to E, so two edges apart.\\nIn regular hexagon, distance between vertices two apart: since each internal angle 120, but in equilateral triangles, distance is s * √3\\nIn regular hexagon with side s, distance between vertices separated by one vertex (like O to E via D) is s * √3\\nBecause triangle O-D-E: O to D is s, D to E is s, angle at D is 120 degrees, so by law of cosines: |OE|^2 = s^2 + s^2 - 2 s s cos(120°) = 2s^2 - 2s^2 (-1/2) = 2s^2 + s^2 = 3s^2, so |OE| = s√3\\nSimilarly, opposite vertices distance 2s.\\n\\nNow, we have pentagon with side s_p = (√5 - 1)/2\\nAnd s_s = s_h = s, unknown for now.\\n\\nNow, the connection: at vertex I, square and pentagon meet.\\nSimilarly at A, square and hexagon meet; but since both share the edge? At A, in square, edges to C and to O? In square I-C-A-O, so at A, adjacent to C and O.\\nIn hexagon, at A, adjacent to L and O.\\nSo both polygons have edge A-O.\\nMoreover, since |AO| = s for both, and it's the same edge, so actually, the edge AO is shared by both the square and the hexagon!\\nIs that possible?\\nSquare ICAO has edge AO, hexagon ALBEDO has edge OA, same edge.\\nSo yes, they share the edge AO.\\nSimilarly, do they share other edges? Probably not.\\nBut importantly, since they share the edge AO, and are both regular polygons, their relative position is fixed once we fix the plane.\\nSpecifically, the square and hexagon share the edge AO, so they are coplanar, and we can fix them.\\nNow, the dihedral angle, but since it's plane, they must be on the same side or opposite, but in plane, when two polygons share an edge, they can be on the same side or folded, but since it's a plane embedding, and no crossing, likely they are on the same plane, so the angle between them is fixed by the polygons.\\nActually, when two polygons share an edge in a plane, they can be on the same side or opposite sides of the edge, but since it's a simple embedding, probably we assume they don't overlap, but mathematically, there might be two possibilities: the polygons on the same side of the edge or on opposite sides.\\nBut in this case, since it's a plane, and polygons are filled, but the problem doesn't specify, so we need to consider the combinatorial embedding.\\nTypically, for such problems, when two polygons share an edge, they can be attached externally or internally, but in plane, sharing an edge means they are adjacent, and the angle at the edge.\\nBut for regular polygons, the internal angles are different.\\nSquare has internal angle 90 degrees, hexagon has 120 degrees.\\nWhen they share an edge AO, the angle between the two polygons at that edge.\\nBut since they are in the same plane, the total angle around the edge must be considered, but actually, at the edge, the two polygons are on opposite sides of the line AO.\\nSpecifically, the square occupies one side of the line AO, the hexagon the other side, or same side.\\nBut if they are on the same side, they might overlap, which might not be intended.\\nUsually, in such configurations, they are attached along the edge, so that they are on opposite sides of the line AO.\\nMoreover, since the internal angles are different, the turn angles.\\nTo avoid overlap, likely they are on opposite sides.\\nBut let's calculate the angle.\\nSuppose we fix edge AO.\\nSet coordinate: put A at origin, O at (s, 0), so vector AO = (s, 0)\\nNow, for the square ICAO, with vertices in order I-C-A-O.\\nFrom A to O is vector (s,0)\\nNow, the next vertex from A: in the square, from A, it goes to C and to O.\\nOrder I-C-A-O, so at A, it comes from C and goes to O.\\nSo the incoming edge is C to A, outgoing is A to O.\\nSince it's a square, the turn is 90 degrees.\\nSpecifically, the vector from C to A, then A to O.\\nThe direction: since it's a square, the vector C to A should be perpendicular to A to O, and same magnitude.\\nNow, the order: I-C-A-O, so from C to A to O.\\nSo the turn at A: from direction C to A to direction A to O.\\nIn a convex square, this should be a left turn or right turn.\\nAssuming counter-clockwise order, it would be a left turn of 90 degrees.\\nSo vector C to A, then A to O, the vector A to O is rotated 90 degrees from vector C to A.\\nVector from C to A: let’s say vector U, then vector from A to O is obtained by rotating U by -90 degrees (clockwise) for a right turn, or +90 for left.\\nStandard: in polygon traversal, for counter-clockwise, the interior is on the left.\\nSo if we traverse I-C-A-O-I counter-clockwise, then at A, coming from C to A, going to O, the turn is left (counter-clockwise) by 90 degrees.\\nSo the direction change: the incoming direction is from C to A, vector V_in = A - C\\nOutgoing direction V_out = O - A\\nThen V_out is V_in rotated by +90 degrees (counter-clockwise).\\nRotation by 90 deg CCW: (x,y) -> (-y,x)\\nSo if V_in = (p,q), then V_out = (-q, p)\\nBut V_out = O - A = (s, 0) - (0,0) = (s, 0)  [since A at (0,0), O at (s,0)]\\nSo (s, 0) = (-q, p)\\nSo -q = s, p = 0\\nThus q = -s, p = 0\\nSo V_in = (0, -s)\\nBut V_in = A - C = (0,0) - C = -C\\nSo -C = (0, -s) ⇒ C = (0, s)\\nThen from I to C: C is at (0,s), and I is connected to C and to O.\\nFrom I to C: vector C - I\\nAnd from I to O: O - I\\nIn square, should be perpendicular, etc.\\nSince we have C at (0,s), A at (0,0), O at (s,0)\\nThen I should be such that IC and IO are edges.\\nFrom C to I and I to O.\\nVector C to I should be perpendicular to vector I to O, and same length.\\nSince it's a square, and we have three points, I can be found.\\nPoints: C(0,s), A(0,0), O(s,0)\\nIn order I-C-A-O, so from I to C to A to O.\\nSo I to C: from I to (0,s)\\nC to A: (0,s) to (0,0)\\nA to O: (0,0) to (s,0)\\nO to I: (s,0) to I\\nFor it to be a square, the vector from O to I should be equal to vector from C to A, which is (0,-s), or something.\\nVector C to A: (0-0, 0-s) = (0,-s)\\nVector A to O: (s-0, 0-0) = (s,0)\\nVector O to I: should be same as vector C to A? In a square, opposite sides equal.\\nSide I to C and A to O should be equal and parallel?\\nI to C and A to O: A to O is (s,0), so I to C should be (s,0)? But C is at (0,s), so if I to C is (s,0), then I is at (0,s) - (s,0) = (-s, s)? Let's compute.\\nLet I be (x,y)\\nThen vector I to C: (0 - x, s - y)\\nVector C to A: (0-0, 0-s) = (0,-s)\\nVector A to O: (s-0, 0-0) = (s,0)\\nVector O to I: (x - s, y - 0) = (x-s, y)\\nFor square, consecutive sides perpendicular and equal length.\\nLength of I to C: sqrt((0-x)^2 + (s-y)^2)\\nLength of C to A: s\\nSo |I to C| = s\\nSimilarly, angle at C: between vectors C to I and C to A.\\nVector from C to I: (x-0, y-s) = (x, y-s)\\nVector from C to A: (0-0, 0-s) = (0,-s)\\nDot product: (x)(0) + (y-s)(-s) = -s(y-s)\\nMagnitude both s, so cos theta = [ -s(y-s) ] / (s * s) = - (y-s)/s\\nFor 90 degree angle, dot product should be 0, so -s(y-s) = 0 ⇒ y = s\\nThen |I to C| = distance from (x,y) to (0,s) = |x| since y=s, so |x| = s ⇒ x = s or x = -s\\nNow, similarly, at A, etc.\\nIf y=s, and |I to C| = |x| = s, so x= s or x= -s\\nNow, vector O to I: (x-s, y) = (x-s, s)\\nLength should be s, so (x-s)^2 + s^2 = s^2 ⇒ (x-s)^2 = 0 ⇒ x=s\\nBut if x=s, y=s, then I at (s,s)\\nThen check: I(s,s), C(0,s), A(0,0), O(s,0)\\nThen vector I to C: (-s,0), length s\\nC to A: (0,-s), length s\\nA to O: (s,0), length s\\nO to I: (0,s), length s\\nAngles: at C, vectors to I: (s,0)? From C to I: (s-0,s-s)=(s,0), from C to A: (0,-s), dot product s*0 + 0*(-s)=0, good.\\nAt A, from A to C: (0,s), from A to O: (s,0), dot product 0, good.\\nAt O, from O to A: (-s,0), from O to I: (0,s), dot product 0, good.\\nAt I, from I to O: (0,-s), from I to C: (-s,0), dot product 0, good.\\nAnd order: I(s,s)-C(0,s)-A(0,0)-O(s,0)-I(s,s), which is counter-clockwise, good.\\nNow, if we had chosen x=-s, but then |O to I| = distance from (s,0) to (-s,s) = sqrt((2s)^2 + s^2)=s√5 ≠ s, unless s=0, so only x=s, y=s.\\nBut earlier I thought y=s, x=s or -s, but x=-s gives |O to I| = |(-s-s, s-0)| = |-2s, s| = s√(4+1)=s√5 ≠ s, so only I at (s,s)\\nBut is there another possibility? When we assumed counter-clockwise.\\nWhat if the square is clockwise?\\nSuppose order I-C-A-O is clockwise.\\nThen at A, turn is clockwise 90 degrees.\\nSo vector V_out = V_in rotated by -90 degrees.\\nV_out = O - A = (s,0)\\nV_in = A - C\\nV_out = rotate V_in by -90 deg: (x,y) -> (y, -x)\\nSo (s,0) = (q, -p) if V_in=(p,q)\\nSo q = s, -p = 0 ⇒ p=0, q=s\\nSo V_in = (0,s)\\nA - C = (0,s) ⇒ C = A - (0,s) = (0,0) - (0,s) = (0,-s)\\nThen similarly, I can be found.\\nC(0,-s), A(0,0), O(s,0)\\nThen I: from I to C, and O to I.\\n|I to C| = s, |O to I| = s\\nVector C to A: (0,s)\\nAt C, vectors to I and to A.\\nVector C to A: (0,s)\\nVector C to I: (x-0, y-(-s)) = (x, y+s)\\nDot product for 90 deg: (x)(0) + (y+s)(s) = s(y+s) = 0 ⇒ y = -s\\nThen |I to C| = distance to (0,-s) = |x| = s ⇒ x=±s\\nNow |O to I| = distance from (s,0) to (x,-s) = sqrt((x-s)^2 + (-s-0)^2) = sqrt((x-s)^2 + s^2)\\nSet to s: (x-s)^2 + s^2 = s^2 ⇒ (x-s)^2=0 ⇒ x=s\\nSo I at (s,-s)\\nThen points: I(s,-s), C(0,-s), A(0,0), O(s,0)\\nOrder I-C-A-O: from (s,-s) to (0,-s) to (0,0) to (s,0), which is clockwise.\\nSo two possible orientations for the square: one with I above, one with I below the line AO.\\nIn first case, I at (s,s), in second at (s,-s)\\nNow, similarly for the hexagon.\\nHexagon ALBEDO, with vertices A,L,B,E,D,O in order.\\nWe have A at (0,0), O at (s,0)\\nNow, in hexagon, from A to L to B to E to D to O to A\\nAt A, edges to L and to O.\\nVector from A to O: (s,0)\\nVector from A to L: let’s say W\\nIn regular hexagon, internal angle 120 degrees.\\nAssuming counter-clockwise order, at A, coming from O to A, going to L.\\nTraverse O to A to L.\\nIncoming vector: A - O = (-s, 0)\\nOutgoing vector: L - A\\nFor counter-clockwise, turn left by 60 degrees? Internal angle 120, so turn angle is 180 - 120 = 60 degrees left.\\nIn polygon traversal, the external angle is 60 degrees for regular hexagon.\\nSo at each vertex, turn by 60 degrees.\\nFor counter-clockwise, turn left 60 degrees.\\nSo the direction change: the outgoing direction is the incoming direction rotated by +60 degrees.\\nIncoming direction: from O to A: (s,0) - wait, vector is A - O = (-s, 0)? No.\\nWhen traversing from O to A to L, the incoming vector is A - O\\nO is (s,0), A is (0,0), so A - O = (-s, 0)\\nOutgoing vector is L - A\\nAfter turning left 60 degrees, the outgoing vector should be the incoming vector rotated by +60 degrees.\\nRotation by 60 deg CCW: (x,y) -> (x cos60 - y sin60, x sin60 + y cos60) = (x/2 - y √3/2, x √3/2 + y/2)\\nSo incoming vector: (-s, 0)\\nRotate by +60 deg: ( (-s)(1/2) - (0)(√3/2), (-s)(√3/2) + (0)(1/2) ) = (-s/2, -s √3 / 2)\\nSo outgoing vector L - A = (-s/2, -s √3 / 2)\\nThus L = A + (-s/2, -s √3 / 2) = (0,0) + (-s/2, -s √3 / 2) = (-s/2, -s √3 / 2)\\nThen continue.\\nBut we may not need all.\\nNow, if clockwise, turn right 60 degrees, so rotate by -60 deg.\\nIncoming vector A - O = (-s, 0)\\nRotate by -60 deg: (x,y) -> (x cos(-60) - y sin(-60), x sin(-60) + y cos(-60)) = (x/2 + y √3/2, -x √3/2 + y/2)\\nSo (-s,0) -> ( -s/2 + 0, -(-s)√3/2 + 0 ) = (-s/2, s √3 / 2)\\nSo L = A + (-s/2, s √3 / 2) = (-s/2, s √3 / 2)\\nSo for hexagon, two possible positions: L above or below.\\nBut now, the square and hexagon share the edge AO, so their relative position depends on whether they are on the same side or opposite sides.\\nIn the first case, for square counter-clockwise, I is at (s,s), which is above the x-axis (since s>0)\\nFor hexagon counter-clockwise, L is at (-s/2, -s √3 / 2), which is below the x-axis\\nSo they are on opposite sides of AO.\\nSimilarly, if both clockwise: square has I at (s,-s), below; hexagon has L at (-s/2, s √3 / 2), above; again opposite sides.\\nNow, what if mixed? Suppose square counter-clockwise (I above), hexagon clockwise (L above), then both on the same side.\\nSimilarly, square clockwise (I below), hexagon counter-clockwise (L below), both on same side.\\nIn that case, they might overlap or not, but geometrically possible.\\nSo potentially four combinations for the square-hexagon pair.\\nBut now, we have the pentagon attached at I.\\nPentagon VENTI, with vertices V,E,N,T,I in order.\\nIt shares vertex I with the square.\\nAt I, the pentagon is attached.\\nIn the pentagon, at vertex I, it has neighbors T and V.\\nIn the cycle V-E-N-T-I-V, so at I, adjacent to T and V.\\nSo edges IT and IV.\\nNow, the square also has edges at I: in the square, I is adjacent to C and to O.\\nSo edges IC and IO.\\nNow, when we attach the pentagon at I, it can be rotated around I, so the direction of the edges from I can vary.\\nHowever, the angle between the existing edges and the new ones.\\nBut since no other constraints yet, the pentagon can be rotated in any direction around I, but we have another connection: the pentagon shares vertex E with the hexagon.\\nE is in both pentagon and hexagon.\\nSo once we fix the positions, E must coincide.\\nSo the relative position is constrained by the shared vertex E.\\nSo we need to ensure that the E from pentagon matches E from hexagon.\\nSo let's proceed.\\nFirst, fix the square and hexagon configuration.\\nWe have edge AO fixed: A(0,0), O(s,0)\\nNow, for the square, two choices:\\nChoice S1: counter-clockwise, I at (s,s)\\nChoice S2: clockwise, I at (s,-s)\\nFor hexagon, two choices:\\nH1: counter-clockwise, then L at (-s/2, -s √3 / 2), and we can find E.\\nIn hexagon A-L-B-E-D-O-A, counter-clockwise.\\nFrom A(0,0) to L(-s/2, -s √3 / 2)\\nThen L to B: in regular hexagon, each side length s, turn 60 deg left.\\nVector A to L: (-s/2, -s √3 / 2)\\nThen at L, incoming from A to L: vector L - A = (-s/2, -s √3 / 2)\\nOutgoing to B: rotate this vector by +60 deg CCW.\\nRotate (-s/2, -s √3 / 2) by 60 deg CCW:\\nx' = x cos60 - y sin60 = (-s/2)(1/2) - (-s √3 / 2)(√3 / 2) = -s/4 - (-3s/4) = -s/4 + 3s/4 = s/2\\ny' = x sin60 + y cos60 = (-s/2)(√3/2) + (-s √3 / 2)(1/2) = -s√3/4 - s√3/4 = -s√3/2\\nSo vector L to B: (s/2, -s√3/2)\\nThus B = L + (s/2, -s√3/2) = (-s/2, -s√3/2) + (s/2, -s√3/2) = (0, -s√3)\\nThen B to E: at B, incoming from L to B: (s/2, -s√3/2)\\nOutgoing to E: rotate by +60 deg CCW:\\nx' = (s/2)(1/2) - (-s√3/2)(√3/2) = s/4 - (-3s/4) = s/4 + 3s/4 = s\\ny' = (s/2)(√3/2) + (-s√3/2)(1/2) = s√3/4 - s√3/4 = 0\\nSo vector B to E: (s, 0)\\nThus E = B + (s,0) = (0, -s√3) + (s,0) = (s, -s√3)\\nThen E to D, etc., but we have E at (s, -s√3)\\nSimilarly, if hexagon clockwise, H2: then earlier, L at (-s/2, s √3 / 2)\\nThen similar calculation, or by symmetry, E will be at (s, s√3)\\nBecause reflection over x-axis.\\nSo summary for hexagon:\\nH1 (ccw): E at (s, -s√3)\\nH2 (cw): E at (s, s√3)\\nNow for square:\\nS1 (ccw): I at (s,s)\\nS2 (cw): I at (s,-s)\\nNow, the pentagon is attached at I, and must pass through E.\\nSo for each combination of S and H, we have positions of I and E, and the pentagon VENTI has vertices including I and E, and is regular.\\nMoreover, the distance between I and E must match the distance in the pentagon.\\nIn the pentagon, what is the distance between I and E?\\nVertices: V,E,N,T,I\\nOrder: V-E-N-T-I-V\\nSo from E to I: E to N to T to I, so three steps, or E to V to I, two steps? Neighbors of E: V and N\\nNeighbors of I: T and V\\nSo common neighbor V.\\nPath E-V-I, two edges.\\nSo distance |EI| is the length of a diagonal, specifically spanning two edges.\\nIn regular pentagon, as before, diagonal length is s_p * φ, where s_p is side length, φ=(1+√5)/2\\nEarlier we have s_p = (√5 - 1)/2, but s_p is fixed by IN=1, but here |EI| depends on s_p, but s_p is not yet related to s.\\nActually, s_p is determined by the pentagon, but we don't know it yet; earlier I assumed IN is diagonal, but IN is within pentagon, and we know |IN|=1, so yes, s_p is fixed: since IN is a diagonal, |IN| = s_p φ = 1, so s_p = 1/φ = (√5 - 1)/2\\nThen |EI| = distance between E and I in pentagon.\\nAs above, E and I are separated by two edges (E-V-I), so it's a diagonal, so |EI| = s_p φ = 1\\nSame as IN.\\nIs that right? In regular pentagon, all diagonals are equal, yes, since symmetric.\\nSo |EI| = s_p φ = 1\\nSimilarly, |IN| = 1, as given.\\nSo in the pentagon, distance between E and I is 1.\\nNow, in the plane, we have points I and E at certain positions depending on the square and hexagon choices, and the distance between them must be 1.\\nMoreover, since the pentagon is regular, once I and E are fixed, and the side length is fixed (s_p = (√5 - 1)/2), and |EI| = 1, which matches the diagonal, so it is consistent, but we need to ensure that such a regular pentagon exists with vertices I and E at distance 1, and the correct separation.\\nIn a regular pentagon, for two vertices separated by two edges, the distance is indeed the diagonal, which is s_p φ, and we have s_p φ =1, so |EI| must be 1, which is satisfied by construction.\\nBut for given two points I and E at distance 1, how many regular pentagons have these two vertices with the correct adjacency?\\nSpecifically, in the pentagon, E and I are not adjacent; they are connected by a path of two edges, so the chord spans two sides.\\nIn a regular pentagon, given two vertices at diagonal distance, there are generally two possible regular pentagons that have those two vertices: one on each side of the line joining them.\\nBut in this case, since the labeling is fixed (order V-E-N-T-I), the orientation matters.\\nBut let's compute the distance between I and E from the coordinates.\\nWe have different cases based on S and H choices.\\nCase 1: S1 and H1: square ccw, hexagon ccw\\nThen I at (s,s), E at (s, -s√3)\\nThen distance |IE| = distance between (s,s) and (s, -s√3) = |s - (-s√3)| in y-direction, same x, so |s + s√3| = s(1 + √3)\\nSet this equal to 1: s(1 + √3) = 1 ⇒ s = 1/(1+√3) = √3 - 1  (rationalize: (√3 -1)/(3-1) = (√3 -1)/2)\\nBut we need |IE| = 1, so s(1 + √3) = 1\\nBut 1 + √3 ≈ 1 + 1.732 = 2.732, so s ≈ 1/2.732 ≈ 0.366\\nNow, is this valid? But we have to check if a regular pentagon can be formed, but since |IE| =1 and it should be the diagonal, and s_p is fixed, but here |IE| is set to 1, which is required, so for this s, |IE| = s(1+√3) =1, so it's satisfied.\\nBut s is determined.\\nNow, for this fixed I and E, we need to place the regular pentagon with vertices including I and E, with the order such that E and I are separated by one vertex (V).\\nIn the plane, given two points E and I at distance 1, and we want a regular pentagon where E and I are two vertices apart.\\nThe number of such pentagons: generally, there are two possibilities, corresponding to the pentagon on one side or the other of the line EI.\\nMoreover, for each, the orientation (clockwise or counter-clockwise) might be determined by the labeling.\\nBut in this case, since the labeling V-E-N-T-I specifies the order, it might fix the orientation.\\nBut let's see.\\nFor now, in this configuration, with I and E fixed, and |IE|=1, and we need a regular pentagon with side s_p = (√5 -1)/2 ≈ (2.236-1)/2=1.236/2=0.618, and diagonal 1, which is consistent since s_p φ = [(√5-1)/2] * [(√5+1)/2] = [(5-1)/4] = 4/4=1, yes.\\nNow, given two points E and I at distance d=1, and we want to find points V,N,T such that it's a regular pentagon with vertices in order E,V,T,N,I or something.\\nOrder is V-E-N-T-I, so the sequence is V to E to N to T to I to V.\\nSo from E to I, it's E-N-T-I, three steps, but earlier I said E to I via V is two steps: E-V-I.\\nIn the cycle: V-E-N-T-I-V\\nSo edges: V-E, E-N, N-T, T-I, I-V\\nSo from E to I: one path E-N-T-I (three edges), another path E-V-I (two edges)\\nThe shorter path is two edges, so they are at graph distance 2.\\nIn terms of the chord, the straight-line distance is the diagonal, which is fixed.\\nTo construct the pentagon, given E and I, and knowing that they are not adjacent, and the step is 2, we can find the other vertices.\\nIn a regular pentagon, the diagonal length determines everything.\\nFor two points at distance d (diagonal), the side length is d / φ = d (φ - 1) = d (√5 -1)/2\\nWhich is consistent.\\nNow, the number of regular pentagons with given diagonal EI: there are generally two: one on each side of the line EI.\\nEach will have the vertices in a specific order.\\nDepending on the order, it might match V-E-N-T-I or the reverse.\\nBut since the labeling specifies V-E-N-T-I, which might imply a direction.\\nFor example, if we go from E to I via N and T, or via V.\\nIn the sequence, from E, next is N, then T, then I, so the path E-N-T-I is followed, which is three edges, while E-V-I is two edges, but the order specifies E to N, so it's taking the longer way around? That can't be.\\nIn a pentagon, from E to I, there are two paths: one of length 2 (E-V-I), one of length 3 (E-N-T-I). The labeling V-E-N-T-I suggests that from E, it goes to N, not to V? But in the cycle, after E is N, so yes, the next vertex from E is N, so the path is E to N to T to I, so it's the longer path.\\nBut in a pentagon, you can traverse in either direction, but the naming V-E-N-T-I suggests the order around the polygon is V,E,N,T,I in sequence.\\nSo if we list them in order, it could be clockwise or counter-clockwise.\\nBut in either case, from E, the next is N, and the previous is V.\\nSo the two neighbors of E are V and N.\\nSimilarly for I, neighbors are T and V.\\nSo the edge between E and V, and between E and N.\\nNow, the distance |EV| = s_p, |EN| = s_p, |EI| = diagonal =1\\nIn the plane, given E and I fixed, distance 1, we need to place V and N such that |EV| = s_p, |IV| = s_p, |EN| = s_p, |IN| = s_p? No.\\n|EV| = side length = s_p\\n|IV| = ? I and V are adjacent, since edge I-V, so |IV| = s_p\\nSimilarly, |EN| = s_p, |NT| = s_p, |TI| = s_p\\nBut |EI| =1, as diagonal.\\nNow, V is adjacent to both E and I, so V is at intersection of circle center E radius s_p and circle center I radius s_p.\\nSimilarly for N, but N is not directly constrained yet.\\nBut since it's regular, once V is placed, others follow.\\nSo focus on V.\\nV is adjacent to E and to I, so |EV| = s_p, |IV| = s_p\\nAnd |EI| =1\\nSo triangle EIV has |EI|=1, |EV|=s_p, |IV|=s_p\\nSo it's isosceles with EV=IV=s_p, base EI=1\\nNow, s_p = (√5 -1)/2 ≈ 0.618\\nCheck triangle inequality: s_p + s_p = 2*0.618=1.236 >1, s_p +1 > s_p, ok.\\nNow, the two circles: center E radius s_p, center I radius s_p, intersect at points that form equilateral? No, distance between centers is 1, radii both s_p.\\nSo the intersection points: the line joining E and I, the intersection points are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector.\\nThe distance from E to I is 1, so the line EI.\\nLet M be midpoint of EI.\\nThen distance from M to V: by Pythagoras, in triangle EMV, EM = 0.5, EV = s_p, so MV = sqrt( s_p^2 - (0.5)^2 )\\nCompute s_p^2 = [(√5 -1)/2]^2 = (5 -2√5 +1)/4 = (6 - 2√5)/4 = (3 - √5)/2\\n(0.5)^2 = 0.25 = 1/4\\nSo MV^2 = s_p^2 - 1/4 = (3 - √5)/2 - 1/4 = (6 - 2√5 - 1)/4 = (5 - 2√5)/4\\nNow √5≈2.236, 2√5≈4.472, 5-4.472=0.528>0, so real.\\nMV = sqrt( (5 - 2√5)/4 ) = (1/2) sqrt(5 - 2√5)\\nThere are two such points V, symmetric wiper respect to line EI.\\nFor each choice of V, we can complete the pentagon.\\nIn the regular pentagon, once two adjacent vertices are fixed, and the orientation, the rest is determined.\\nHere, we have E and I, and V is adjacent to both, so once we choose which V (above or below the line EI), then the pentagon is determined.\\nMoreover, the order: in the pentagon, from E to V to I, or from E to I to V, but since V is adjacent to both, and in the cycle, it's V-E-N-T-I-V, so from V to E to N, and from I to V, so the order around V is I-V-E or E-V-I.\\nIn the sequence, it's ...T-I-V-E-N..., so at V, it comes from I and goes to E, so order I-V-E.\\nSo the turn at V is from I to V to E.\\nDepending on the choice of V, the angle might be correct for a regular pentagon.\\nIn a regular pentagon, the internal angle is 108 degrees, so the turn is 72 degrees, but as long as we place V such that the triangle is correct, and then extend, it should be fine, and for each position of V, there is a unique regular pentagon extending it with the given adjacency.\\nSince the pentagon is determined by three consecutive vertices, but here we have V,E,I, but they are not consecutive in the sense that E and I are not adjacent; in the pentagon, V,E,I: V to E is edge, E to I is not edge, so not consecutive.\\nV and E adjacent, V and I adjacent, but E and I not adjacent.\\nSo vertices V,E,I form a triangle, which is isosceles with VE=VI=s_p, EI=1.\\nIn the regular pentagon, this triangle is fixed up to reflection.\\nOnce we choose the position of V (two choices: on one side or the other of EI), then the entire pentagon is determined, because from V and E, we can find the next vertex, but we need the direction.\\nFrom E, we have to go to N, not back to V.\\nIn the cycle, after E is N, so from E, the next vertex is N, which is not V.\\nSo from E, we go to N, which is the other neighbor.\\nIn the regular pentagon, given V and E, and knowing that from E we go to N, which is at 108 degrees or something.\\nBut since the pentagon is regular, once we fix two adjacent vertices and the orientation (clockwise or counter-clockwise), the rest is determined.\\nHere, we have vertices V and E, which are adjacent, and we know the edge between them.\\nAlso, we have vertex I, which is adjacent to V, but not to E.\\nIn the pentagon, the vertex I is at a certain position relative to V and E.\\nFor the pentagon to close, with the given distances, it should work as long as the triangle V E I has the correct shape, which it does, since in a regular pentagon, the triangle formed by two adjacent vertices and the vertex two away is isosceles with sides s_p, s_p, and base diagonal 1.\\nAnd we have that.\\nNow, for fixed E and I, and fixed s_p, the two possible positions for V correspond to the two possible pentagons: one on each side.\\nAnd for each, the labeling can be assigned consistently.\\nFor example, in one choice, the order might be V-E-N-T-I, in the other it might be the reverse, but since the name is VENTI, it might specify the order, so perhaps only one orientation is intended, but likely both are valid as long as the vertices are labeled in order.\\nTo be safe, probably for each configuration of I and E, there are two possible pentagons, giving potentially different positions for N, but since we need ON, and O is fixed, it might give different distances.\\nBut in this case, for fixed I and E, and fixed V, then N is determined, etc.\\nBut let's first compute for each choice of square and hexagon, the distance |IE|, and set it to 1, which gives s, then find N, then find |ON|.\\nBut |IE| must be 1, so for each combination, we can solve for s such that |IE| =1.\\nThen for that s, we have positions, then we can find the pentagon, then find N, then |ON|.\\nAnd since for each, there might be choices for the pentagon orientation, we get different N.\\nSo let's list the cases.\\nCase 1: S1 (square ccw): I at (s,s)\\nH1 (hex ccw): E at (s, -s√3)\\nThen |IE| = |s - (-s√3)| = |s + s√3| = s(1 + √3)  (since s>0)\\nSet equal to 1: s(1 + √3) = 1 ⇒ s = 1/(1+√3) = √3 - 1  after rationalizing? 1/(1+√3) * (√3-1)/(√3-1) = (√3-1)/(3-1) = (√3-1)/2\\nNow, I at (s,s) = ((√3-1)/2, (√3-1)/2)\\nE at (s, -s√3) = ((√3-1)/2, -√3 (√3-1)/2) = ((√3-1)/2, - (3 - √3)/2 )\\nNow, we need to place the regular pentagon with vertices including I and E, with |IE|=1, and s_p = (√5-1)/2\\nNow, V is at intersection of circle center E radius s_p and circle center I radius s_p.\\nSince |EI|=1, and s_p <1, and as computed, the distance is greater than |s_p - s_p|=0, less than s_p + s_p, so two intersection points.\\nLet me denote the two possible positions for V.\\nThe line EI: from I(s,s) to E(s, -s√3), so it's a vertical line at x=s, since both have x=s.\\nI(s,s), E(s, -s√3), so yes, same x-coordinate, so line EI is vertical, x=s.\\nMidpoint M of EI: x=s, y= (s + (-s√3))/2 = s(1 - √3)/2\\nNow, the two points V are located at distance MV from M, perpendicular to EI.\\nSince EI is vertical, perpendicular is horizontal, so same y, x differs.\\nMV = sqrt( s_p^2 - (EI/2)^2 ) = sqrt( s_p^2 - (0.5)^2 )\\nAs before, s_p^2 = (3 - √5)/2 ? Earlier: s_p = (√5 -1)/2, so s_p^2 = [(√5 -1)/2]^2 = (5 -2√5 +1)/4 = (6 - 2√5)/4 = (3 - √5)/2\\n(0.5)^2 = 1/4\\nSo MV^2 = (3 - √5)/2 - 1/4 = (6 - 2√5 - 1)/4 = (5 - 2√5)/4\\nSo MV = sqrt(5 - 2√5)/2\\nNumerically, √5≈2.236, 2√5≈4.472, 5-4.472=0.528, sqrt(0.528)≈0.726, so MV≈0.726/2=0.363? No\\nMV = sqrt( (5 - 2√5)/4 ) = (1/2) sqrt(5 - 2√5) ≈ (1/2)*sqrt(0.528)≈ (1/2)*0.726=0.363\\nNow, since EI is vertical, the two points V have the same y-coordinate as M, and x = s ± MV\\nM has x=s, y= s(1 - √3)/2\\nSo V has coordinates ( s ± MV , s(1 - √3)/2 )\\nWith MV = (1/2) sqrt(5 - 2√5)\\nNow, once V is chosen, we can find the other vertices.\\nBut we need N.\\nIn the pentagon, from E, we go to N.\\nSince we have E and V, and the pentagon is regular, we can find N as the next vertex from E in the direction away from V.\\nIn the regular pentagon, at vertex E, the two neighbors are V and N.\\nThe angle at E is 108 degrees.\\nFrom the edge E-V, the edge E-N is at 108 degrees.\\nDepending on the orientation.\\nSince the pentagon is regular, the vector from E to N can be obtained by rotating the vector from E to V by ±108 degrees, but need to see the direction.\\nIn the cycle V-E-N-T-I-V, so from V to E to N, so at E, incoming from V, outgoing to N.\\nFor counter-clockwise traversal, it would be a left turn of 72 degrees (external angle), but for the vector, the direction.\\nVector from V to E, then from E to N.\\nThe turn angle is 108 degrees internal, so the direction change is 180 - 108 = 72 degrees.\\nFor counter-clockwise, turn left 72 degrees.\\nSo the vector E to N is the vector V to E rotated by +72 degrees (CCW).\\nVector V to E is E - V\\nThen rotate by +72 deg to get the direction of E to N.\\nThen scale to length s_p.\\nSimilarly for clockwise.\\nBut in our case, we have the labeling, so likely we need to choose the orientation so that the order is correct.\\nSince we have two choices for V, and for each, we can choose the orientation of the pentagon, but probably for each V, there is only one way to complete to a regular pentagon with the given adjacencies.\\nTo simplify, since the pentagon is determined, and we need the position of N, which will be symmetric in some way.\\nBut notice that for fixed I and E, and fixed s_p, the two possible pentagons are mirror images over the line EI.\\nIn this case, EI is vertical, so mirror over x=s.\\nNow, the point N will be at symmetric positions with respect to this line.\\nNow, we need distance to O.\\nO is at (s,0)\\nNow, in this case, s = (√3 -1)/2 ≈ (1.732-1)/2=0.732/2=0.366\\nO at (s,0) ≈ (0.366, 0)\\nI at (s,s) ≈ (0.366, 0.366)\\nE at (s, -s√3) ≈ (0.366, -0.366*1.732)≈ (0.366, -0.634)\\nLine EI is x=s≈0.366, vertical.\\nNow, the two possible V: at (s ± MV, y_m) with y_m = s(1 - √3)/2 ≈ 0.366*(1-1.732)/2 = 0.366*(-0.732)/2 ≈ 0.366*(-0.366) ≈ -0.134\\nMV ≈ 0.363 as above\\nSo V at (s + 0.363, -0.134) or (s - 0.363, -0.134) ≈ (0.366+0.363, -0.134)=(0.729,-0.134) or (0.366-0.363,-0.134)=(0.003,-0.134)\\nNow, then from E, we go to N.\\nBut perhaps compute N.\\nSince the setup is symmetric, and O is on the line x=s, and the two possible N will be symmetric with respect to x=s, so their distances to O will be the same, because O is on the axis of symmetry.\\nO is at (s,0), and the line x=s is the perpendicular bisector, and since the two configurations are symmetric with respect to x=s, and O is on it, then |ON| will be the same for both choices of the pentagon.\\nSo in this case, only one value of |ON| for this configuration.\\nNow, similarly for other cases.\\nSo in case 1, we have one value of |ON|.\\nNow, case 2: S1 and H2\\nS1: I at (s,s)\\nH2: hexagon clockwise, so E at (s, s√3)\\nThen |IE| = |s - s√3| = s|1 - √3| = s(√3 - 1) since √3>1\\nSet to 1: s(√3 - 1) = 1 ⇒ s = 1/(√3 - 1) = (√3 +1)/2  after rationalizing\\nNow, I at (s,s), E at (s, s√3)\\nSo again, both have x=s, so line EI is vertical.\\nMidpoint M: x=s, y= (s + s√3)/2 = s(1+√3)/2\\nThen MV = same as before, (1/2) sqrt(5 - 2√5)\\nThen V at (s ± MV, y_m)\\nThen similarly, the two possible N will be symmetric w.r.t. x=s, and O at (s,0), so again |ON| same for both pentagon choices.\\nSo one value.\\nNow, case 3: S2 and H1\\nS2: square clockwise, I at (s,-s)\\nH1: hex ccw, E at (s, -s√3)\\nThen |IE| = | -s - (-s√3) | = | -s + s√3 | = s|√3 - 1| = s(√3 - 1)\\nSet to 1: s(√3 - 1) = 1 ⇒ s = 1/(√3 - 1) = (√3 +1)/2\\nI at (s,-s), E at (s, -s√3)\\nBoth x=s, so vertical line.\\nM at x=s, y= [-s + (-s√3)]/2 = -s(1+√3)/2\\nV at (s ± MV, y_m)\\nO at (s,0)\\nSymmetric w.r.t. x=s, so |ON| same for both pentagon choices.\\nOne value.\\nCase 4: S2 and H2\\nS2: I at (s,-s)\\nH2: hex cw, E at (s, s√3)\\n|IE| = | -s - s√3 | = s| -1 - √3 | = s(1 + √3)\\nSet to 1: s(1+√3)=1 ⇒ s=1/(1+√3)=(√3-1)/2\\nI at (s,-s), E at (s, s√3)\\nVertical line x=s\\nM at x=s, y= [-s + s√3]/2 = s(√3 -1)/2\\nV at (s ± MV, y_m)\\nO at (s,0)\\nAgain, symmetric, so |ON| same for both pentagon choices.\\nSo in all four cases, we get potentially different |ON|, but each case gives one value of |ON| (since the two pentagon choices give same distance).\\nNow, are these values different?\\nWe have four cases:\\nCase 1: s = (√3 -1)/2, I at (s,s), E at (s,-s√3), O at (s,0)\\nCase 2: s = (√3 +1)/2, I at (s,s), E at (s,s√3), O at (s,0)\\nCase 3: s = (√3 +1)/2, I at (s,-s), E at (s,-s√3), O at (s,0)\\nCase 4: s = (√3 -1)/2, I at (s,-s), E at (s,s√3), O at (s,0)\\nNotice that in all cases, O is at (s,0), and the line EI is vertical at x=s, so O is on the line EI.\\nTo find |ON|, we need the position of N.\\nN is a vertex of the pentagon.\\nIn the regular pentagon, with E and I fixed, and V chosen, then N can be found.\\nSince the two choices of V give symmetric N with respect to the line EI, and O is on EI, |ON| is the same for both, as said.\\nSo we can compute for one choice of V.\\nMoreover, in all cases, the relative geometry might give the same |ON| or different.\\nBut let's compute the distance.\\nNotice that in the pentagon, once E and I are fixed, and the size, the point N is at a fixed distance from the line EI or something.\\nBut perhaps compute explicitly.\\nSince the pentagon is regular, and we know E and I, and the step, we can find the coordinate of N.\\nIn a regular pentagon, the coordinates can be given.\\nBut perhaps use vectors.\\nLet me take case 1 as example.\\nCase 1: s = (√3 -1)/2\\nLet k = s = (√3 -1)/2\\nThen I at (k,k), E at (k, -k√3), O at (k,0)\\n|IE| = k(1 + √3) = [(√3 -1)/2] * (1 + √3) = (√3 -1)(1 + √3)/2 = [√3*1 +3 -1 -√3]/2 = [2]/2 =1, good.\\ns_p = (√5 -1)/2\\nNow, let me find N.\\nFirst, find V.\\nAs above, M, midpoint of EI: x=k, y= (k + (-k√3))/2 = k(1 - √3)/2\\nMV = (1/2) sqrt(5 - 2√5)\\nLet d = MV = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{5 - 2\\sqrt{5}}\\nNow, take one V, say V1 at (k + d, y_m) = (k + d, k(1 - √3)/2)\\nNow, in the pentagon, from E to N.\\nAt vertex E, we have edges to V and to N.\\nVector from E to V: V - E = ( (k+d) - k , y_m - (-k√3) ) = (d, y_m + k√3)\\nBut y_m = k(1 - √3)/2, so y_m + k√3 = k(1 - √3)/2 + k√3 = k[ (1 - √3) + 2√3 ] / 2 = k(1 + √3)/2\\nSo vector E to V: (d, k(1 + √3)/2)\\nNow, in the regular pentagon, the vector from E to N should make a 108 degree angle with this vector.\\nSpecifically, since the internal angle is 108 degrees, the two vectors from E, to V and to N, have angle 108 degrees between them.\\nSo the dot product should be |EV| |EN| cos 108° = s_p * s_p * cos 108°\\nCos 108° = cos(180-72) = -cos 72°\\nCos 72° = (√5 -1)/4, so cos 108° = - (√5 -1)/4\\n|EV| = s_p, |EN| = s_p\\nSo dot product = s_p^2 * [ - (√5 -1)/4 ]\\nNow, let vector E to N be (p,q)\\nThen dot product with E to V: (d, k(1+√3)/2) • (p,q) = d p + [k(1+√3)/2] q = s_p^2 (- (√5 -1)/4)\\nAlso, |E to N| = s_p, so p^2 + q^2 = s_p^2\\nMoreover, the direction: depending on the orientation.\\nIn the pentagon, from E, going to N, and previously from V to E.\\nFor the order V-E-N, if we go counter-clockwise, the turn is left, so the vector E to N is rotated from the vector V to E by +72 degrees or something.\\nVector from V to E is E - V = (-d, -k(1+√3)/2)\\nThen for counter-clockwise traversal, the outgoing vector E to N is this vector rotated by +72 degrees (external angle).\\nRotation by 72 deg CCW: (x,y) -> (x cos72 - y sin72, x sin72 + y cos72)\\nCos72 = (√5 -1)/4, sin72 = sqrt(10 + 2√5)/4 or something, but messy.\\nSince we have the dot product, and magnitude, we can solve, but it's complicated.\\nNotice that in all cases, because of the symmetry, and O is on the line EI, and the pentagon is symmetric, perhaps |ON| depends only on the distance from O to the line and to the points, but let's calculate the final answer.\\nPerhaps the distance ON is the same in all cases, or there are few values.\\nAnother thought: in all four cases, the product or something.\\nPerhaps compute the distance from O to I and O to E, but we need N.\\nRecall that in the pentagon, N is a vertex, and we can find its position relative to E and I.\\nIn a regular pentagon with vertices V,E,N,T,I, the point N can be expressed.\\nBut perhaps assume that for each configuration, after placing the pentagon, we get a value, but due to symmetry, some may be the same.\\nLet's list the s values:\\nCase 1: s = (√3 -1)/2 ≈ (1.732-1)/2 = 0.366\\nCase 2: s = (√3 +1)/2 ≈ (1.732+1)/2 = 1.366\\nCase 3: s = (√3 +1)/2 = 1.366\\nCase 4: s = (√3 -1)/2 = 0.366\\nNow, in case 1 and 4, s is small, in 2 and 3, s is large.\\nIn case 1: I at (s,s)≈(0.366,0.366), E at (s,-s√3)≈(0.366,-0.634), O at (s,0)≈(0.366,0)\\nIn case 4: I at (s,-s)≈(0.366,-0.366), E at (s,s√3)≈(0.366,0.634), O at (0.366,0)\\nSo in case 1, I is above, E is below; in case 4, I is below, E is above.\\nBut the relative position to O: in both, O is at (s,0), and the line is vertical.\\nNow, the pentagon will be placed, and N will be somewhere.\\nDue to the symmetry, in case 1 and case 4, the configuration might be symmetric, and |ON| might be the same.\\nSimilarly for case 2 and 3.\\nIn case 2: s=1.366, I at (1.366,1.366), E at (1.366,1.366*1.732)≈(1.366,2.366), O at (1.366,0)\\nCase 3: s=1.366, I at (1.366,-1.366), E at (1.366,-2.366), O at (1.366,0)\\nSo case 2 has I and E above, case 3 has both below.\\nAgain, symmetric with respect to x-axis.\\nAnd since the pentagon placement might be symmetric, |ON| might be the same for case 2 and case 3.\\nMoreover, for case 1 and case 4, |ON| might be the same.\\nSo possibly only two distinct values of |ON|.\\nBut is that true?\\nIn case 1: O is at (s,0), I at (s,s), E at (s,-s√3), with s= (√3-1)/2\\nThe y-coordinates: I at y=s>0, E at y= -s√3 <0, O at y=0\\nIn case 4: I at y= -s <0, E at y= s√3 >0, O at y=0, with same s\\nSo the configuration is reflected over the x-axis, but since the pentagon might be placed similarly, the distance |ON| should be the same because distance is invariant under reflection.\\nSimilarly for case 2 and 3.\\nSo only two distinct values: one for the small s cases (1 and 4), one for the large s cases (2 and 3).\\nNow, are these two values different?\\nProbably yes, since s is different.\\nSo two possible values of |ON|.\\nBut the problem asks for the number of possible values of ON, given IN=1.\\nSo answer should be 2.\\nBut let me confirm if in each case, with the pentagon, we indeed get a valid configuration.\\nIn particular, in the pentagon, when we place it, the point N should not conflict, but since no other constraints, likely ok.\\nMoreover, in all cases, |IE|=1, and s_p is fixed, so the pentagon can be formed.\\nAlso, the shared vertex E is satisfied by construction.\\nSo yes.\\nTherefore, there are two possible values for |ON|.\\nSo the number is 2.\\nBut is there any restriction that the polygons don't overlap or something? The problem doesn't specify, so probably all embeddings are allowed.\\nThus, answer is 2.\\n\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6106\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\"\n}",
