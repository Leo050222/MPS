We want to minimize the total number eaten, so we want to maximize k.\\nTry k = 3:\\nRemaining: 3 red, 3 yellow, 3 blue.\\nEaten: red = 10 - 3 = 7, yellow = 7 - 3 = 4, blue = 3 - 3 = 0.\\nTotal eaten = 7 + 4 + 0 = 11.\\nTry k = 2:\\nEaten: red = 8, yellow = 5, blue = 1, total = 14 (greater than 11).\\nTry k = 1:\\nEaten: red = 9, yellow = 6, blue = 2, total = 17 (greater than 11).\\nTry k = 0:\\nEaten: red = 10, yellow = 7, blue = 3, total = 20 (greater than 11).\\nThus the smallest possible number of candies eaten is 11.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"44\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
