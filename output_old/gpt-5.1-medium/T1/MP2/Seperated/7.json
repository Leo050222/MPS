  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nThe six central angles of the spinner are four angles of size x degrees, plus 20 degrees and 140 degrees. Since a full circle is 360 degrees,\\n\\n4x + 20 + 140 = 360\\n4x + 160 = 360\\n4x = 200\\nx = 50.\\n\\nIf the four regions with central angle x are the shaded ones, then the total shaded angle is\\n4x = 4 * 50 = 200 degrees.\\n\\nThe probability that the arrow lands in a shaded region equals (shaded angle) / (total angle) = 200 / 360 = 5/9.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe are given that (205800, 35k) is a happy pair, meaning gcd(205800, 35k) is a perfect square, and we must count positive integers k <= 2940 with this property.\\n\\nFirst factor the relevant integers:\\n205800 = 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^2 * 7^3.\\n35 = 5 * 7.\\nSince 35 divides 205800, write 205800 = 35 * 5880, so\\n5880 = 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1 * 7^2.\\n\\nUse the property gcd(35a, 35k) = 35 * gcd(a, k):\\ngcd(205800, 35k) = gcd(35 * 5880, 35k) = 35 * gcd(5880, k).\\n\\nLet d = gcd(5880, k). Then we need 35 * d to be a perfect square.\\nFactor a general divisor d of 5880:\\n5880 = 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1 * 7^2,\\nso any d has the form d = 2^a * 3^b * 5^c * 7^e with 0 <= a <= 3, 0 <= b <= 1, 0 <= c <= 1, 0 <= e <= 2.\\n\\nThen\\n35 * d = 5^(1+c) * 7^(1+e) * 2^a * 3^b.\\nFor this to be a perfect square, each exponent must be even:\\n- For prime 2: a must be even -> a is 0 or 2.\\n- For prime 3: b must be even, and since b is 0 or 1, we must have b = 0.\\n- For prime 5: exponent 1 + c even -> c = 1.\\n- For prime 7: exponent 1 + e even -> e = 1.\\nThus d must be 2^a * 3^0 * 5^1 * 7^1 with a in {0,2}, so d is either 35 or 140.\\nTherefore gcd(5880,k) must be either 35 or 140.\\n\\nNow we count k <= 2940 with gcd(5880, k) = 35 or 140.\\n\\nCase 1: gcd(5880, k) = 35.\\nLet k = 35 * t. Then k <= 2940 implies t <= 2940 / 35 = 84.\\nWe must impose that gcd(5880, 35t) = 35.\\nUsing prime exponents for k = 35t, one finds that this occurs exactly when t has no factors of 2, 3, or 7. Equivalently, gcd(t, 42) = 1.\\nSo we must count t in {1, 2, ..., 84} that are coprime to 42.\\n\\nThe pattern of numbers relatively prime to 42 repeats every 42. The count of integers between 1 and 42 that are coprime to 42 is phi(42):\\nphi(42) = 42 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/7) = 42 * (1/2) * (2/3) * (6/7) = 12.\\nOn the interval 1 to 84, which is two full blocks of length 42, the number of t with gcd(t, 42) = 1 is 2 * 12 = 24.\\nSo there are 24 values of k in this case.\\n\\nCase 2: gcd(5880, k) = 140.\\nAgain write k = 35 * t. Analyzing prime exponents, this gcd equals 140 exactly when:\\n- t is divisible by 2^2 but by no higher power of 2 (so exponent 2 in 2),\\n- t is not divisible by 3,\\n- t is not divisible by 7.\\nEquivalently, write t = 4u, where u is not divisible by 2, 3, or 7, i.e., gcd(u, 42) = 1.\\n\\nNow k = 35t = 35 * 4u = 140u, and k <= 2940 gives u <= 2940 / 140 = 21.\\nSo we must count u in {1, 2, ..., 21} with gcd(u, 42) = 1.\\n\\nListing 1 through 21 and excluding multiples of 2, 3, or 7 leaves\\nu in {1, 5, 11, 13, 17, 19}, a total of 6 values.\\n\\nThus there are 6 values of k in this case.\\n\\nThe two cases are disjoint, because in Case 1 t has no factor 2 while in Case 2 t is divisible by 4. Hence the total number of valid k is\\n24 + 6 = 30.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"5/9\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"30\"\n}",
