  "math_problem": "When three consecutive integers are added, the total is 27. What is the result when the same three integers are multiplied? Instead of determining the product of the three consecutive integers, simply find $p = 100\\left(m - \\frac{177}{20}\\right)$, where $m$ is the middle integer among the three consecutive integers. If $x \\%$ of 60 is 12, what is $p \\%$ of $x$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Let the three consecutive integers be m-1, m, and m+1, where m is the middle integer. Their sum is (m-1) + m + (m+1) = 3m. We are told this sum is 27, so 3m = 27, giving m = 9.\\n\\nWe are asked to compute p = 100(m - 177/20). Substitute m = 9:\\n9 = 180/20, so\\nm - 177/20 = 180/20 - 177/20 = 3/20.\\nThus,\\np = 100 * (3/20) = 100 * 3 / 20 = 5 * 3 = 15.\\n\\nNext, we are told that x% of 60 is 12. That means:\\n(x/100) * 60 = 12.\\nSimplify: 60x/100 = 12 → 3x/5 = 12 → 3x = 60 → x = 20.\\n\\nWe now find p% of x, i.e., (p/100) * x:\\n(p/100) * x = (15/100) * 20 = 15 * (20/100) = 15 * (1/5) = 3.\\n\\nTherefore, p% of x equals 3.\",\n  \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
