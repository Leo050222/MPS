  "math_problem": "Storage space on a computer is measured in gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB), where $1 \\mathrm{~GB} = 1024 \\mathrm{MB}$. Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes. The regular price for a bicycle is $\\\\$320$. The bicycle is on sale for $20\\\\%$ off. The regular price for a helmet is $\\\\$80$. The helmet is on sale for $10\\\\%$ off. If Sandra bought both items on sale, her percentage savings on the total purchase is $\\left( \\frac{\\text{total savings}}{\\text{total price}} \\right) \\times d\\\\%$. Compute this value.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) Convert the hard drive capacity from GB to MB.\\n   - 1 GB = 1024 MB\\n   - C = 300 GB × 1024 MB/GB = 300 × 1024 = 307200 MB\\n\\n2) Compute d = C − 307100.\\n   - d = 307200 − 307100 = 100\\n\\n3) Find the sale prices and savings.\\n   Bicycle:\\n   - Regular price = 320\\n   - Discount = 20% of 320 = 0.20 × 320 = 64\\n   - Sale price = 320 − 64 = 256\\n\\n   Helmet:\\n   - Regular price = 80\\n   - Discount = 10% of 80 = 0.10 × 80 = 8\\n   - Sale price = 80 − 8 = 72\\n\\n4) Compute total regular price and total savings.\\n   - Total regular price = 320 + 80 = 400\\n   - Total sale price = 256 + 72 = 328\\n   - Total savings = 400 − 328 = 72\\n\\n5) Compute the base percentage savings (before multiplying by d).\\n   - (total savings) / (total price) = 72 / 400\\n   - Simplify: 72/400 = 9/50\\n\\n6) Multiply by d to get the final percentage value.\\n   - d = 100\\n   - (9/50) × 100 = 9 × 2 = 18\\n\\nTherefore, the computed value is 18.\",\n  \"answer\": \"18\"\n}",
