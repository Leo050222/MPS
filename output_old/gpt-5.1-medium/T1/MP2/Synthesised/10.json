  "math_problem": "The price of each item at the Gauss Gadget Store has been reduced by $20 \\%$ from its original price. An MP3 player has a sale price of $\\\\$ 112$. What would the same MP3 player sell for if it was on sale for $30 \\%$ off of its original price? Instead of computing the sale price under the alternative discount percentage, simply find $k = R - 128$, where $R$ is the original price of the MP3 player determined from the given sale price after the initial discount. For some integers $m$ and $n$, the expression $(x+m)(x+n)$ is equal to a quadratic expression in $x$ with a constant term of $-k$. Which of the following cannot be a value of $m$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Let R be the original price of the MP3 player.\\n\\nA 20% discount means the sale price is 80% of the original price:\\n0.8R = 112\\n=> R = 112 / 0.8 = 112 * (10/8) = 112 * 1.25 = 140.\\n\\nThen k = R - 128 = 140 - 128 = 12.\\n\\nWe are told that (x + m)(x + n) is a quadratic with constant term -k, so the constant term is mn:\\nmn = -k = -12.\\n\\nThus m and n are integers whose product is -12. The integer factor pairs of -12 are:\\n(1, -12), (-1, 12), (2, -6), (-2, 6), (3, -4), (-3, 4), (4, -3), (-4, 3), (6, -2), (-6, 2), (12, -1), (-12, 1).\\n\\nFrom these, all possible integer values of m are:\\n-12, -6, -4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\\n\\nTherefore, any integer m that is not in this list cannot be a value of m.\",\n  \"answer\": \"The only possible integer values of m are -12,-6,-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,6,12; any other integer cannot be a value of m.\"\n}",
