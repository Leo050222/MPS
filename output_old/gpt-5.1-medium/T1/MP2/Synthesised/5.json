  "math_problem": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$. Shuxin begins with $d$ red candies, 7 yellow candies, and 3 blue candies. After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining. What is the smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate?",
  "reasoning_content": "Shuxin’s candies depend on the value of \\(d\\), which comes from the skateboard/bicycle situation.\n\n**1. Find \\(k\\) and then \\(d\\):**\n\nLet the number of skateboards be \\(7k\\) and bicycles be \\(4k\\).  \nWe are told there are 12 more skateboards than bicycles:\n\\[\n7k = 4k + 12\n\\]\n\\[\n3k = 12 \\Rightarrow k = 4\n\\]\n\nWe are asked to find:\n\\[\nd = k + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10\n\\]\n\n**2. Initial candies for Shuxin:**\n\n- Red: \\(d = 10\\)\n- Yellow: \\(7\\)\n- Blue: \\(3\\)\n\nTotal initial candies:\n\\[\n10 + 7 + 3 = 20\n\\]\n\nAfter eating, the numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies left are equal. Let that common remaining number be \\(t\\).\n\nSo:\n- Red remaining: \\(t = 10 - e_r\\)\n- Yellow remaining: \\(t = 7 - e_y\\)\n- Blue remaining: \\(t = 3 - e_b\\)\n\nwhere \\(e_r, e_y, e_b\\) are the numbers of each color she eats, each \\(\\ge 0\\).\n\nThus:\n\\[\nt \\le 10,\\quad t \\le 7,\\quad t \\le 3\n\\Rightarrow t \\le 3\n\\]\n\nTo minimize the total eaten, we want Shuxin to have as many candies left as possible (largest possible \\(t\\)).\n\nThe maximum feasible \\(t\\) is \\(t = 3\\).\n\n**3. Compute candies eaten when \\(t = 3\\):**\n\nRemaining:\n- Red: \\(3\\)\n- Yellow: \\(3\\)\n- Blue: \\(3\\)\n\nSo she ate:\n- Red: \\(10 - 3 = 7\\)\n- Yellow: \\(7 - 3 = 4\\)\n- Blue: \\(3 - 3 = 0\\)\n\nTotal eaten:\n\\[\n7 + 4 + 0 = 11\n\\]\n\nThis configuration is valid and uses the largest possible \\(t\\), so 11 is the smallest possible number of candies eaten.\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
