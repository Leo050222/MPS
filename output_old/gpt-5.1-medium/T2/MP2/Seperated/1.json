  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Factor 1998 = 2 * 3^3 * 37. The function satisfies f(ab) = f(a) + f(b), so it is completely additive over prime powers: f(n) = sum k*f(p) over prime powers p^k || n. We use the given zero conditions to find f on the relevant primes.\\nSince any n ending in 4 has f(n)=0, consider n=4. We have 4=2^2, so f(4) = 2*f(2) = 0, implying f(2)=0. Next, 6 is a perfect number, so f(6)=0. But 6=2*3, so f(6)=f(2)+f(3)=0+f(3), hence f(3)=0. To determine f(37), use another number ending in 4 that involves 37: 74 ends in 4 and factors as 74=2*37. Thus f(74) = f(2) + f(37) = 0, giving f(37)=0. Therefore f(1998) = f(2) + 3*f(3) + f(37) = 0 + 3*0 + 0 = 0.\\nProblem 2: The beaver walks from (0,0) to (4,4) using only steps (1,0) (right) and (0,1) (up), and must never visit a point with y > x, i.e., the path must stay on or below the diagonal y = x. Such paths are Dyck paths of semilength 4. The number of Dyck paths of semilength n is the nth Catalan number C_n = (1/(n+1)) * binom(2n, n). For n=4, C_4 = (1/5) * binom(8,4) = (1/5) * 70 = 14. Hence there are 14 such paths.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"14\"\n}",
