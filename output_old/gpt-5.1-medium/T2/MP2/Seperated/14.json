  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Calculating prime conditions**\n\nI need to find primes \\( p \\) where \\( 5p = \\text{floor}(n^2 / 5) \\) for some positive integer \\( n \\). I can express \\( n^2 / 5 \\) in the interval \\([5p, 5p+1)\\), and that leads to \\( n^2 \\) lying in \\([25p, 25p+5)\\). This means \\( n^2 \\) can be expressed as \\( 25p + k \\) for some integer \\( k \\) between 0 and 4. I need to compute the possible residues modulo 25, which gives me {0,1,4,6,9,11,14,16,19,21,24}. For \\( k \\) values of 0 to 4, only 0, 1, and 4 are valid.**Exploring prime conditions**\n\nI’m examining \\( n^2 \\) based on the equations \\( n^2 = 25p \\), \\( 25p + 1 \\), or \\( 25p + 4 \\). In the first case, \\( p = \\frac{n^2}{25} \\) suggests \\( p \\) can’t be prime unless \\( n/5 \\) is prime, which won't work for other primes. For the second case \\( n^2 = 25p + 1 \\), it leads to factors differing by 2. In the third case, for \\( n^2 = 25p + 4 \\), \\( p \\) needs to be prime and the numerator must be divisible by 25, linking it to residues modulo 25. I'll finalize what values for \\( n \\) could work based on these prime conditions.**Finding congruences for primes**\n\nI'm working on finding relevant residues for \\( n \\) modulo 25. When calculating, I see that \\( n \\equiv 1 \\) or 24 modulo 25 will work for case 2, while case 3 gives residues of \\( n \\equiv 2 \\) or 23 modulo 25. I should also remember that \\( p \\) must be a positive integer prime. It might simplify things to search for \\( n \\) that makes \\( \\text{floor}(n^2/5) \\) a multiple of 5, which leads to more congruence conditions to check. It's a bit complex, but I'm getting closer!**Analyzing modular conditions**\n\nI'm examining \\( n^2 \\) with respect to \\( r \\) modulo 25. When \\( n^2 = 25k + r \\), I break it down into cases based on the value of \\( r \\). If \\( r \\) is in \\( \\{0, 5, 10, 15, 20\\} \\), the conditions simplify nicely to \\( r \\) being 0 as a multiple of 25. If \\( r \\) is not a multiple of 5, I get additional possibilities for \\( r \\) to fall between 1 and 4. Therefore, the viable residues for \\( n^2 \\) modulo 25 are {0, 1, 4}, which aligns with earlier findings. So, \\( \\text{floor}(n^2/5) = 5p \\) holds true if \\( n^2 \\equiv 0, 1, 4 \\) modulo 25.{\n \"reasoning\": \"I explored the mathematical conditions for primes based on the equations n^2 = 25k + r, where r can be 0, 1, or 4.

I avoided excessive detail yet provided a concise logical structure for the user while ensuring to account for all necessary findings succinctly.\",\n \"answer_1\": \"344.54\",\n \"answer_2\": \"52\"\n}</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, donuts must be bought in groups of 12. To reach at least 550 donuts, we need the smallest multiple of 12 that is ≥ 550, which is 46×12 = 552 donuts. At $7.49 per dozen, the cost is 46×7.49 = 344.54. For Problem 2, we need primes p such that 5p = floor(n²/5). Writing n² = 25k + r with r in {0,…,24}, the condition that floor(n²/5) is a multiple of 5 forces r ∈ {0,1,4}. The r = 0 case would make p a perfect square and thus not prime. For r = 1, n² = 25k + 1, and we get p = (n² − 1)/25; using n ≡ ±1 (mod 25) and factoring shows p = t(25t ± 2), which yields the prime p = 23. For r = 4, n² = 25k + 4, leading to p = (n² − 4)/25; using n ≡ ±2 (mod 25) and factoring gives p = t(25t ± 4), which yields the prime p = 29. These are the only primes that work, so their sum is 23 + 29 = 52.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"344.54\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"52\"\n}",
