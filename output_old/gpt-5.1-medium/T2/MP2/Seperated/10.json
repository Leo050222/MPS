  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Evaluating face symmetry**\n\nI need to think about symmetry and how the expectation depends on the count of distinct faces seen, not the specific ones. I should be careful since the number of \"new\" faces available depends on how many distinct faces have been collected. If we have k distinct faces and the last one is among them, we have some unseen and some seen faces. The unseen faces count would be (6-k), and this approach helps clarify my understanding of outcomes.**Calculating expected rolls**\n\nI'm working on the probability of the next roll being a new distinct face, which is (6-k)/5, or an old face, which is (k-1)/5. The transition probabilities depend on k, not the specific faces. I see it as a Markov chain where the state is the number of distinct faces collected. I want to determine the expected total number of rolls needed to get all 6 faces, using E_k for expected rolls once k faces have been seen. It's clear that for k=6, E_6=0.**Calculating expected additional rolls**\n\nI’m figuring out the expected rolls for collecting distinct faces for k=1 to 5. When I’m in state k, I take one roll and can either increase k or stay the same. After setting up the equation for E_k, I can solve it: \n\nE_k = 5/(6-k) + E_{k+1}. It's kind of nice how it telescopes! Then, I calculate E_5, E_4, E_3, E_2, and E_1 down to the values. Ultimately, it turns out the expected total rolls needed is 149/12 after the first roll!**Checking logic of expected rolls**\n\nI need to confirm the logic behind defining E_k as the expected additional rolls needed to reach all 6 numbers after having rolled in state k. For k=1, it does mean expected total rolls = 1 + E_1. I should verify the derived equation for k: \n\nWhen in state k, it looks like E_k = 1 + (6-k)/5 * E_{k+1} + (k-1)/5 * E_k holds up — so that seems correct! Multiplying through and simplifying shows that E_k = 5/(6-k) + E_{k+1}. Everything seems to check out here!**Reviewing expected value calculation**\n\nI might have been overthinking this! Each step involves one roll, and the denominator of 5 reflects equal probabilities among 5 options, which makes sense. Now, if I calculate numerically: 149/12 is roughly 12.4167. The standard coupon collector's expectation for 6 faces is 14.7, but the adjacency constraint should lower the expected time — so 12.4 being less than 14.7 seems plausible. \n\nNow, I need to create a compact summary without diving into detailed algebra, and I’ll stick to key strategies and equations. I'll use JSON to format the reasoning and answers.</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Rewrite sqrt(15 + sqrt(216)) as sqrt(15 + 6*sqrt(6)) and assume it equals sqrt(m) + sqrt(n). Squaring gives m + n = 15 and 2*sqrt(mn) = 6*sqrt(6), so mn = 54. Solving m + n = 15 and mn = 54 yields {m, n} = {9, 6}, hence sqrt(15 + sqrt(216)) = 3 + sqrt(6), so a = 3, b = 6, and a/b = 1/2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Model the process by the number k of distinct faces seen so far (k from 1 to 6). Given k distinct faces have appeared and the last roll is one of them, the next roll is uniformly among the 5 other faces: (6−k) of these are new and (k−1) are old. Let E_k be the expected additional rolls to see all 6 faces from state k. Then for k = 1,...,5, the recurrence is E_k = 1 + ((6−k)/5) * E_{k+1} + ((k−1)/5) * E_k, which simplifies to E_k = 5/(6−k) + E_{k+1}, with E_6 = 0. Solving backward gives E_5 = 5, E_4 = 15/2, E_3 = 55/6, E_2 = 125/12, E_1 = 137/12. Including the initial roll (which creates state k = 1), the total expected number of rolls is 1 + E_1 = 149/12.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"149/12\"\n}",
