  "math_problem": "$a$ and $b$ are integers such that $a+\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{15+\\sqrt{216}}$. Compute $a / b$. Instead of computing the ratio of the integer coefficient to the radicand in the denested form of the nested radical, simply find $k = a + 3$, where $a$ is the integer coefficient in that denested form. Mark has a cursed $k$-sided die that never rolls the same number twice in a row, and all other outcomes are equally likely. Compute the expected number of rolls it takes for Mark to roll every number at least once.",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing probability and constraints**\n\nI'm thinking about how the process of growing i is much like independent trials where the success probability varies with i, but there's also a no-repeat restriction. The formula holds for each roll after the first one. I wonder if there's a dependence on previous history. The distribution of seen versus unseen faces seems independent of the last, even though the last is drawn from the set. The waiting time for the next new face is geometric, and my calculations yield expected rolls to be 5/(6-i) starting from the state i.**Calculating expected rolls**\n\nI'm considering that the first roll is always new, which allows me to count it as reaching i=1. For each subsequent i from 1 to 5, I can apply the formula. The expected total rolls, E, can be calculated as: 1 (for the first roll) plus the sum of values for each i. \n\nAs I compute: for i=1, it yields 1; for i=2, it's 5/4; for i=3, 5/3; for i=4, 5/2; and for i=5, it’s 5. Altogether, I need to double-check these steps thoroughly to ensure accuracy here!**Summing expected rolls**\n\nI’m summing things up: the total expected rolls so far is 1 (initial) plus the additional rolls I calculated. The formula ends up being 1 + (1 + 5/4 + 5/3 + 5/2 + 5), which simplifies to 7 plus the sum of fractions I need to add. \n\nAfter doing the math, I arrive at 149/12. I’m considering if I should start from i=0, but since the first roll has all new possibilities, it makes sense to treat it separately for accuracy, especially when considering when i=5 and I’ve seen all faces.**Finalizing expected rolls**\n\nAt this stage, when I have 6-i=1, there’s one unseen face among the five allowed, making the probability of getting a new number 1/5, leading to an expectation of 5. So, I confirm the expected rolls total to 149/12, which feels correct. \n\nThey introduced k as k=a+3 for finding the expected number of rolls instead of calculating a/b directly. It seems essential to compute how long it takes for Mark to roll every number on his k-sided die at least once.**Preparing final JSON response**\n\nThe final answer is the expected number of rolls, based on k=6, giving us 149/12. I need to present this as a simplest rational fraction. It seems they don't require an expression in terms of k since it's uniquely determined. I should follow their structure for the JSON object by having both \"reasoning\" and \"answer\" fields. \n\nI'll summarize the high-level reasoning without going into too much detail. My reasoning will state how I derived the expected rolls based on collecting distinct faces. Finally, I will present it in the requested JSON format, ensuring the answer is \"149/12\".</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Write a + √b = √(15 + √216). Squaring and matching rational/irrational parts gives 2a√b = √216 and a² + b = 15, so a²b = 54. With integer a and b, this yields a = 3, b = 6, so k = a + 3 = 6. For the cursed 6-sided die, after the first roll (which always yields a new face), suppose we have seen i distinct faces (1 ≤ i ≤ 5). The next roll cannot repeat the last face, so there are 5 equally likely outcomes; among them, 6 − i are unseen. Thus the probability the next roll is new is (6 − i)/5, so the expected rolls to go from i to i+1 faces is 5/(6 − i). Total expected rolls = 1 (first roll) + Σ_{i=1}^{5} 5/(6 − i) = 1 + (1 + 5/4 + 5/3 + 5/2 + 5) = 149/12.\",\n    \"answer\": \"149/12\"\n}",
