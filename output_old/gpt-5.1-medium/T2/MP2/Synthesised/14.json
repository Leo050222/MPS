  "math_problem": "Victoria wants to order at least 550 donuts from Dunkin' Donuts for the HMMT 2014 November contest. However, donuts only come in multiples of twelve. Assuming every twelve donuts cost $7.49, what is the minimum amount Victoria needs to pay, in dollars? Instead of computing the minimum cost to acquire at least the required number of units when purchases are constrained to multiples of the base quantity, simply find $e = \\left\\lfloor 550 / 12 \\right\\rfloor - 43$. There are two prime numbers $p$ so that $5 p$ can be expressed in the form $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n^{e}}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ for some positive integer $n$. What is the sum of these two prime numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Compute e = floor(550/12) - 43 = 45 - 43 = 2. We need primes p such that 5p = floor(n^2 / 5) for some integer n. This gives 25p ≤ n^2 ≤ 25p + 4, so n^2 = 25p + k with k in {0,1,2,3,4}. Considering quadratic residues modulo 25 and excluding multiples of 5 for n, only k = 1 or 4 are possible, giving n^2 = 25p + 1 or n^2 = 25p + 4. Factoring as (n-1)(n+1) = 25p and (n-2)(n+2) = 25p and using that these factor pairs are coprime and differ by 2 or 4, we find p = 23 in the first case and p = 29 in the second. Their sum is 52.\",\n    \"answer\": \"52\"\n}",
