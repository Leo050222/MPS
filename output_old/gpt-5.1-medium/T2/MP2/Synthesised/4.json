  "math_problem": "Ava and Tiffany participate in a knockout tournament consisting of a total of 32 players. In each of 5 rounds, the remaining players are paired uniformly at random. In each pair, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is knocked out of the tournament. The probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other during the tournament is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of evaluating the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator representing the probability that the two designated players meet during the tournament, simply find $b$, the denominator of that probability when expressed as a reduced fraction. Let $p$ be a real number and $c \\neq 0$ an integer such that $c-0.1<x^{p}\\left(\\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}}\\right)<c+0.1$ for all (positive) real numbers $x$ with $(b-16)<x<10^{-100}$. Find the ordered pair $(p, c)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1. Let’s first find the probability that Ava and Tiffany meet in a 32-player knockout tournament with random pairings each round.\\n\\nThere are 32 players, and the tournament has 31 matches total (each match eliminates exactly one player). Each match corresponds to an unordered pair of players who play each other, and no pair can appear more than once.\\n\\nThere are C(32,2) = 496 possible unordered pairs of players. By symmetry (since all players are indistinguishable in ability and pairings are uniform at random each round), the probability that any specific pair (for example, Ava and Tiffany) ever plays each other is the same as for any other pair. Let this probability be q.\\n\\nThe expected total number of distinct pairs that actually play is exactly 31 (one per match). On the other hand, this expected value is also the sum over all 496 pairs of the probability that each pair plays:\\n\\n496 * q = 31  =>  q = 31/496.\\n\\nSince 496 = 31 * 16, this simplifies to q = 1/16. Thus, the reduced fraction is a/b = 1/16, giving b = 16.\\n\\n2. Using b = 16 in the second part:\\n\\nWe are given that for positive real x with (b - 16) < x < 10^(-100), we have:\\n\\nc - 0.1 < x^p * (1 - (1 + x)^{10}) / (1 + (1 + x)^{10}) < c + 0.1.\\n\\nSince b = 16, the condition becomes 0 < x < 10^(-100).\\n\\nDefine\\n\\nf(x) = x^p * \\\\frac{1 - (1 + x)^{10}}{1 + (1 + x)^{10}}.\\n\\nWe analyze f(x) as x → 0^+.\\n\\n3. Asymptotic expansion of the fraction:\\n\\nWe expand (1 + x)^{10} using the binomial theorem:\\n\\n(1 + x)^{10} = 1 + 10x + 45x^2 + 120x^3 + 210x^4 + 252x^5 + 210x^6 + 120x^7 + 45x^8 + 10x^9 + x^{10}.\\n\\nThen:\\n\\nNumerator: N(x) = 1 - (1 + x)^{10} = -10x - 45x^2 - 120x^3 - ... - x^{10}.\\nDenominator: D(x) = 1 + (1 + x)^{10} = 2 + 10x + 45x^2 + 120x^3 + ... + x^{10}.\\n\\nFor small x,\\n\\nN(x) = -10x + O(x^2),\\nD(x) = 2 + 10x + O(x^2) = 2(1 + 5x + O(x^2)).\\n\\nThus the fraction g(x) := N(x)/D(x) satisfies\\n\\ng(x) = \\\\frac{-10x + O(x^2)}{2(1 + 5x + O(x^2))}\\n     = (-5x + O(x^2)) * (1 - 5x + O(x^2))\\n     = -5x + O(x^2).\\n\\nSo as x → 0^+,\\n\\ng(x) ~ -5x.\\n\\n4. Behavior of f(x) = x^p * g(x):\\n\\nFrom g(x) ~ -5x, we get\\n\\nf(x) ~ x^p * (-5x) = -5 x^{p+1}.\\n\\nConsider the limit as x → 0^+:\\n\\n- If p + 1 > 0, then x^{p+1} → 0, so f(x) → 0. Then to have |f(x) - c| < 0.1 for all sufficiently small positive x, c must be 0. But the problem requires c to be a nonzero integer, so p + 1 > 0 is impossible.\\n\\n- If p + 1 < 0, then x^{p+1} → ∞ as x → 0^+, so |f(x)| → ∞. Then f(x) cannot stay within any fixed finite interval [c - 0.1, c + 0.1] for all small x, so p + 1 < 0 is also impossible.\\n\\n- Therefore the only remaining possibility is p + 1 = 0, i.e. p = -1.\\n\\n5. Determine c when p = -1:\\n\\nFor p = -1,\\n\\nf(x) = x^{-1} * g(x) = \\\\frac{g(x)}{x}.\\n\\nWe found that g(x) = -5x + O(x^2). Dividing by x gives\\n\\nf(x) = -5 + O(x).\\n\\nThus\\n\\\\lim_{x → 0^+} f(x) = -5.\\n\\nFor the inequality\\n\\nc - 0.1 < f(x) < c + 0.1\\n\\nto hold for all 0 < x < 10^{-100}, c must equal this limit, so c = -5.\\n\\nMoreover, since\\n\\nf(x) = -5 + O(x),\\n\\nthere exist constants K and δ > 0 such that |f(x) + 5| ≤ Kx for 0 < x < δ. In particular, for 0 < x < 10^{-100},\\n\\n|f(x) + 5| ≤ K * 10^{-100}.\\n\\nBecause K is some fixed finite constant (coming from a Taylor expansion of analytic functions), K * 10^{-100} is vastly smaller than 0.1, so\\n\\n-5 - 0.1 < f(x) < -5 + 0.1\\n\\nholds for all 0 < x < 10^{-100}.\\n\\nThus p = -1 and c = -5 satisfy the given condition, and from the earlier argument these values are uniquely determined.\\n\\n6. Final result:\\n\\nThe ordered pair (p, c) is (-1, -5).\",\n  \"answer\": \"(-1,-5)\"\n}",
