  "math_problem": "The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to $k>0$, find $k$. Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition. A ladder is leaning against a house with its lower end $d$ feet from the house. When the lower end is pulled 9 feet farther from the house, the upper end slides 13 feet down. How long is the ladder (in feet)?",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Working through ladder problem**\n\nI started with the equation \\(3w^2 - 8w = 0\\) and found \\(w = \\frac{8}{3}\\). Then I calculated \\(d\\) from \\(w\\) and found that it equals 15 ft. Now, I have a right triangle formed by the ladder, where the base was initially 15 ft. After pulling the lower end 9 ft further out, I need to equate the expressions for the ladder’s length using the new dimensions. I’ll compute those further now!**Calculating ladder length**\n\nI equated the expressions and found that \\(h_1 = 20\\). Then, I calculated the ladder length \\(L\\) using \\(L^2 = 15^2 + 20^2\\), which led me to \\(L = 25\\). That's a positive length, so the answer is 25. Now, I need to formulate this in JSON format as a single reasoning key without detailing every step. I’ll keep it concise and just present the final value.</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Let the rectangle have width w and length 3w. Perimeter is 8w and area is 3w^2; setting them equal gives 3w^2 = 8w, so w = 8/3. Then d = w + 37/3 = 15. For the ladder, initially the foot is 15 ft from the house and the height is h, so L^2 = 15^2 + h^2. After pulling the foot 9 ft farther (to 24 ft) and the top sliding 13 ft down (height h - 13), we still have L^2 = 24^2 + (h - 13)^2. Equating and solving gives h = 20, so L^2 = 15^2 + 20^2 = 625, hence L = 25.\",\n    \"answer\": \"25\"\n}",
