  "math_problem": "Find two lines of symmetry of the graph of the function $y=x+\\frac{1}{x}$. Express your answer as two equations of the form $y=a x+b$. Instead of determining the equations of the lines of symmetry, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote parallel to the y-axis, derived from the asymptotic analysis of the curve. Determine all triplets of real numbers $(x, y, z)$ satisfying the system of equations $x^{2} y+y^{2} z =k+1039$, $x^{2} z+z^{2} y =260$, $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) =-540$.",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Solving algebraic equations**\n\nI'm working through a system of equations, starting with x^2y + y^2z = 1040, x^2z + z^2y = 260, and another (x-y)(y-z)(z-x) = -540. I need to find all real triplets. First, I subtract the two main equations to simplify. From there, I factor and manipulate terms. I also consider adding the equations together to explore further possibilities. There's a lot to work through! Let's see how it unfolds.**Continuing with factorization**\n\nI'm factoring (y+z) from one of my earlier equations, which leads to some nice simplifications. I end up with two key equations: (y-z)(x^2 + yz) = 780 and (y+z)(x^2 + yz) = 1300. Since x^2 + yz can't equal zero, I divide to find the relationship between (y-z) and (y+z). After some calculations, I find that (y-z)/(y+z) simplifies to 3/5. \n\nFrom there, I express y and z in terms of s (y+z) and d (y-z). It's nice to see everything fit together!**Expressing variables**\n\nI realize it might be easier to express yz in terms of z by substituting y = 4z, leading to yz = 4z^2. So now, s becomes y + z = 5z, which simplifies nicely. Using this, I find that x^2 + yz equals 1300/s and can substitute to get a new equation. When I plug y back into equation (2), I get the same expression as before, so nothing new there. \n\nNow, I focus on satisfying both the cubic-symmetric equation and the equality I've established.**Rearranging equations**\n\nI’m working with the equation 3z(x-4z)(z-x) = -540, and I notice that I can express it differently. I rewrite it as -3z(x-4z)(x-z) = 540, leading to a new equation (D). \n\nThen, I realize I need to also incorporate our earlier equation from (C): x^2 + 4z^2 = 260/z. By multiplying both sides by z, I arrive at x^2 z + 4z^3 = 260, which matches with my previous equation (E). \n\nNow, I’ll solve these two equations together, keeping in mind z cannot be zero. I consider expressing x in terms of z, but it gets complicated, so I think about switching to a variable ratio r = x/z.```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Solved system of equations to find k=1. By algebraic manipulation, found y=4z and solved for z yielding two real triplet solutions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"k=1; (x,y,z)=(16,4,1) or (1,16,4)\"\n}\n```</think>\n\n{  \n  \"reasoning\": \"The curve y = x + 1/x has a vertical asymptote x = 0, whose coefficient vector in Ax + By + C = 0 form is (1,0), so its Euclidean norm is k = 1. Substituting k into the system gives x^2 y + y^2 z = 1040 and x^2 z + z^2 y = 260. Adding and subtracting these equations yields (y − z)(x^2 + yz) = 780 and (y + z)(x^2 + yz) = 1300, from which (y − z)/(y + z) = 3/5 and thus y = 4z. Reducing the system to two equations in x and z and using the product (x − y)(y − z)(z − x) = −540 leads to a quadratic equation in r = x/z with two real roots r = 16 and r = 1/4. These give z^3 = 260/(r^2 + 4), yielding z = 1 and z = 4 respectively, and hence the two real triplets (x, y, z) = (16, 4, 1) and (1, 16, 4).\",\n  \"answer\": \"k=1; (x,y,z)=(16,4,1) or (1,16,4)\"\n}",
