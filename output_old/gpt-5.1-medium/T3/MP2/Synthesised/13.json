  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be square with 4 digits, such that all its digits are less than 6. If we add 1 to each digit the resulting number is another square. Find $n$ Instead of identifying the 4-digit perfect square satisfying the digit increment condition, simply find $m = a - 42$, where $a$ is the integer whose square is that number. P is a polynomial. When P is divided by $x-1$, the remainder is -4 . When P is divided by $x-2$, the remainder is -1 . When $P$ is divided by $x-3$, the remainder is 4 . Determine the remainder when $P$ is divided by $x^{m}-6 x^{2}+11 x-6$.",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Evaluating polynomial remainder**\n\nOkay, I’m calculating with n=2025 and a=45. This gives me m=3, which matches what I thought. So, for \\( x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 \\), I can factor this correctly. Now, I need to find the remainder when P is divided by that cubic polynomial. Since I'm using interpolation, I realize R(x) has degree less than 3, forming a unique polynomial. I'm setting up my system of equations based on the values at 1, 2, and 3 to solve for coefficients.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI've determined that the remainder R(x) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\). Now, I'll need to format this into a JSON response. The user mentioned having a reasoning field in their examples, which seems optional but useful. So, I'll create a structure similar to what they provided:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The remainder was found using polynomial interpolation based on specific evaluated points.\",\n  \"answer\": \"x^2 - 5\"\n}\n```\n\nI should summarize the reasoning briefly without digging into my entire thought process. That way, it keeps everything clear and concise for the user.</think>\n\n{  \n  \"reasoning\": \"First, find the 4-digit square whose digits are all less than 6 and which becomes another perfect square when each digit is increased by 1. Checking known squares, 2025 = 45^2 has digits < 6, and adding 1 to each digit gives 3136 = 56^2, also a square. Thus a = 45 and m = a - 42 = 3. The divisor becomes x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3). When dividing P(x) by this cubic, the remainder R(x) has degree at most 2 and must satisfy R(1) = P(1) = -4, R(2) = P(2) = -1, and R(3) = P(3) = 4. Solving for the unique quadratic R(x) that fits these three values gives R(x) = x^2 - 5.\",\n  \"answer\": \"x^2-5\"\n}",
