  "math_problem": "If $a$ , $b$ are integers and $s=a^3+b^3-60ab(a+b)\\geq 2012$ , find the least possible value of $s$. Instead of finding the least possible value of $s$, simply find $e = s(a,b) - 1914$, where $(a,b)$ are integers satisfying $a + b = 3$ and $(a - b)^2 = 49$. Let $a, b, c$ be the three roots of $p(x)=x^{3}+x^{2}-333 x-1001$. Find $a^{e} + b^{e} + c^{3}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>I think I should offer a concise explanation, maybe just a couple of sentences to summarize the solution without getting into the detailed derivation. That seems perfectly fine. So I’ll format it in JSON like this:\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"...\",\n  \"answer\": \"2003\"\n}\n\nNow I'm focusing on crafting a brief description to fill in that reasoning part. It’s about keeping it simple yet clear!</think>\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"From a + b = 3 and (a − b)^2 = 49, the integer solutions are (a, b) = (5, −2) or (−2, 5). The expression s(a, b) = a^3 + b^3 − 60ab(a + b) is symmetric in a and b, and evaluating at (5, −2) gives s = 1917, so e = s − 1914 = 3. For the cubic p(x) = x^3 + x^2 − 333x − 1001 with roots a, b, c, use Newton’s identities and the relations a + b + c = −1, ab + bc + ca = −333, abc = 1001 to find a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 2003. Since e = 3, the required sum a^e + b^e + c^3 is a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 2003.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2003\"\n}",
