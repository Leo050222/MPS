  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Calculating distinct absolute values**\n\nI need to reason through a problem involving the exponent of p in n! First, I’m looking for m, which is defined as floor(n/p) - 36 for n=2000 and p=23. I calculate floor(2000/23) and find it to be 86. So, m equals 50. \n\nNext, I have the set S, which contains integers from -100 to 100, giving me 201 integers. From S, I choose a random subset of size 50 and need to find the expected number of distinct absolute values. This can be approached using indicator variables for values from 0 to 100.**Calculating expected size of distinct absolute values**\n\nI'm working through the probabilities for how many unique absolute values from my subset T exist. For each absolute value a, I create an indicator I_a to check if there's an x in T where |x| = a. To find the expected size, I'll sum the probabilities of I_a being 1.\n\nFor a = 0, there’s just one possibility, while for a = 1 to 100, I have two options, ±a. The total set S has one zero and the pairs from ±1 to ±100.  I need the probability that zero is included in T, so I’ll calculate using combinations. This gives me probabilities using complementary counts and a simpler combinatorial approach.**Finding probabilities for absolute values**\n\nI'm calculating the probability that at least one of the ±a values is in my subset T. For the value zero, I found that P(0) = 50/201. Now, for values a ≥ 1, I realize there are two related elements.\n\nThe total number of elements is 201, and I'm choosing 50. The probability that none of the special elements (±a) are chosen involves subsets of the remaining 199 elements. I derive the ratios using combinations, which leads me to find that P(I_a=1) = 1 - (151 * 150) / (201 * 200). After simplifying, I get the final probability as 117/268.**Calculating expected number**\n\nI’m determining the expected number E by summing the probabilities. First, I have P0 = 50/201 and then for a from 1 to 100, I compute P_a = 100*(117/268). This gives me 11700/268, which simplifies to 2925/67 after dividing by 4.\n\nNext, I add these fractions—finding a common denominator of 201 and getting E = (50 + 8775)/201. After checking for simplifications, I confirm that 8825/201 is irreducible. My final expected number is about 43.9, and I'll summarize my reasoning in the required JSON format.</think>\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First compute m.
