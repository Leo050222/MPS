  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Computing algebraic expressions**\n\nI’m considering using a substitution like u = x + 1, but keeping it straightforward might be easier. I need to compute t = Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3, and we could manipulate that into x^2 + 2x = t - 3, although that could get messy as a quadratic. A better approach is to expand P(Q(x)) symbolically and match coefficients. I’ll do the algebra off-screen to maintain accuracy, using my mental scratchpad to compute t^2 and t^3 next.**Calculating polynomial terms**\n\nI’ve calculated t^2 as x^4 + 4x^3 + 10x^2 + 12x + 9. Now, for t^3, I multiply t by t^2, which gives x^6 + 6x^5 + 21x^4 + 44x^3 + 63x^2 + 54x + 27 after organizing the terms. \n\nNext, I’ll combine coefficients for P(Q(x)). The coefficient for x^6 comes solely from a, which must be 1. This makes sense, and I’ll follow the same logic for x^5 and x^4 to ensure everything aligns correctly!**Finding polynomial coefficients**\n\nFrom my calculations for t^2, I determined that the coefficient b must be -3 to match the target for the x^4 term. \n\nFor x^3, I found that my calculations worked out nicely, confirming no constraints on c or d. \n\nNext, for x^2, I calculated c will equal 2. The coefficient for x^1 also worked out and confirmed no additional constraints. Finally, for the constant term, d equates to 2. So, now I have P(t) = t^3 - 3t^2 + 2t + 2, and I still need to evaluate P(2).**Calculating and analyzing conditions**\n\nI computed the first problem as 2^3 - 3*2^2 + 2*2 + 2, which simplifies to 2. \n\nFor the second problem, I'm investigating if there exists an irrational α > 1 such that the floor of α^n is 0 mod 2017 for all integers n ≥ 1. This means α^n must fall within integer multiples plus variations of 2017. \n\nI’m considering if α could be an integer multiple of 2017, which would allow it to meet the modular condition, but it should remain irrational. I wonder if something like α = 2017*m*(1+δ) could work, which might help clarify the situation!**Exploring irrational roots and modular conditions**\n\nI'm looking into whether any irrational α can have all integer parts equal to 0 mod prime 2017. This relates to the distribution of {α^n}. My hunch is that only multiples of 2017 will work, because if α isn't a multiple, floor(α^n) would eventually hit all residue classes due to equidistribution. \n\nI’m analyzing how to showcase that α must be a multiple of 2017, using sequences and fractional parts. I suspect that sequence {α^n/2017} can't remain constrained in a limited interval, which could suggest it’s impossible for arbitrary real α. I'll keep exploring this further!**Analyzing irrational conditions with primes**\n\nI'm exploring whether there's an irrational α that can have all integer parts equal to 0 mod 2017. If I let β = α/2017 and analyze floor(α^n), it suggests that β's powers approach rational multiples. \n\nBut creating an irrational α that meets the necessary conditions is tricky. I think using the intersections of intervals can help prove that such α exists, but I might not find an explicit solution. The approach seems dense under certain conditions, but I’m not quite sure if I can ensure there’s always an α satisfying this for every n. I’ll need to keep analyzing this!**Exploring irrational powers and mod conditions**\n\nI'm considering the sequence a_n = α^n to see if there’s an irrational α where its integer parts are divisible by 2017. Given the nature of α, it's tricky since it could be algebraic or transcendental. I’m thinking of defining β = α/2017, and I suspect that for α^n to meet the mod requirements, adjustments need to be made for intervals formed by powers. \n\nIf I can find a way to ensure that the fractional parts of these powers fit into narrow intervals, that might lead to a suitable construction of α. The more I think about it, I suspect there could be many such α satisfying the conditions!**Investigating irrational alpha conditions**\n\nI'm analyzing whether there’s an irrational α such that floor(α^n) is always a multiple of 2017. The range between 2017 and 2018 gives me a starting point for valid intervals. I think I can represent α as a series of narrow intervals while ensuring the constraints hold for the powers. Each time, it should provide a measure that suggests these intervals remain non-empty.\n\nTo solidify my approach, I could think of using nested intervals or a more direct construction to find such an α. It seems like there might not be such an α, but I want to explore options to prove otherwise!**Exploring irrational alpha proofs**\n\nI'm considering how to prove that there isn't an irrational α such that floor(α^n) is a multiple of 2017. If I assume α is greater than 1 and satisfies this condition, it creates a situation where I need to demonstrate contradictions using combinations of powers and modular arithmetic.\n\nChoosing α as something like 2017^k plus a small δ leads to an approximation where the discrepancy grows with n, forcing δ to be zero. This line of reasoning leans heavily towards \"No such α.\" It feels like I can either find contradictions based on specific conditions or perhaps use modular relationships to show impossibilities.**Evaluating irrational alpha existence**\n\nI think the answer I'm leaning towards is that no such irrational α exists. If floor(α^n) is divisible by a prime p, then α would have to be a multiple of p, suggesting it's rational. I can outline an approach involving rational approximation or a lemma to explain this, citing theoretical concepts without going deep into them since the user hasn't restricted advanced theorems. \n\nI also considered using a recursive construction of α to ensure it satisfies the required modular conditions—suggesting an approach that fits within the constraints of mathematical analysis and avoids potential complications.**Analyzing irrational alpha properties**\n\nI'm exploring whether there exists an irrational α such that floor(α^n) is divisible by 2017 for all n. I initially thought it could work by using a specific construction or recursion but realized that it's more complicated. The idea of using nested intervals might help show that an irrational α exists, similar to how one could prove it for simpler moduli like 2. However, the essence of the problem suggests that no such irrational α can satisfy that property. I'll need to support this with some high-level reasoning about rationality and approximations.**Exploring existence of irrational alpha**\n\nI'm trying to find if there's an irrational α such that floor(α^n) is divisible by 2017 for all n. My approach involves nested intervals and continuity, but it’s becoming quite technical. I feel like I might be overcomplicating things. If I assume α = 2017k + γ, I see that k must be an integer, which complicates matters. While there's an insightful theorem about dense sequences, I'm unsure if it applies. Ultimately, my intuition leans toward \"No,\" but I recognize the lack of a clear argument leaves me unsatisfied.**Concluding on existence of alpha**\n\nI’m mulling over whether there's an irrational α such that the floor of its powers is divisible by 2017. Using properties from number theory, my inclination is shifting toward a \"No\" answer, though I’m not entirely confident yet. I think I might have to reference some deeper theorems and modular arithmetic, exploring sequences and limits. Even though my intuition is leaning towards a decisive answer, the complexity and nuances leave me feeling uncertain. Ultimately, I might have to admit that I don’t know definitively.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We are given Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3 and a polynomial P such that P(Q(x)) equals a specific degree-6 polynomial. Since Q is quadratic and P(Q(x)) has degree 6, P must be cubic. Let P(t) = a t^3 + b t^2 + c t + d, where t = Q(x). We compute t, t^2, and t^3 as polynomials in x, then form a t^3 + b t^2 + c t + d and match its coefficients with those of x^6 + 6x^5 + 18x^4 + 32x^3 + 35x^2 + 22x + 8. This yields a system of linear equations in a, b, c, d. Solving it gives a = 1, b = -3, c = 2, d = 2, so P(t) = t^3 - 3t^2 + 2t + 2. Evaluating at t = 2, we get P(2) = 8 - 12 + 4 + 2 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: We are asked whether there exists an irrational α > 1 such that floor(α^n) is always divisible by 2017 for every integer n ≥ 1. This translates to requiring that for each n there is an integer k_n with α^n lying in the very narrow interval [2017 k_n, 2017 k_n + 1). Understanding whether such an α can exist for all n simultaneously involves deep questions about how powers of a real number distribute modulo 1 and relative to arithmetic progressions in the integers. With the tools I have available in this setting, I am not able to determine rigorously whether such an irrational α exists or not.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"I don't know\"\n}",
