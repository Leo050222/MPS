  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Exploring prime fractions**\n\nI'm working on the fraction N/D, where both N and D should be primes. I'm considering cases with g, which is the gcd of (r+5) and (r+1). If g=1, the fraction is irreducible, but there's no solution when I check. If g=2, that leads me to a form of r related to D. I'm going through possibilities, ensuring that N and D can maintain their prime status while adjusting for r and the conditions from above.**Analyzing prime relationships**\n\nI'm diving into the conditions for D to be prime, specifically that both D and D+2 need to be primes, essentially forming twin primes. To satisfy all conditions, I've established that r must also be prime and follow certain modular conditions. If D is odd and greater than 2, then D has to be at least 3. Thus, my calculations focus on ensuring D and D+2 qualify as twin primes while relating them to r.**Exploring twin primes**\n\nI'm checking small values for D and exploring whether they meet my criteria. Starting with D=3, I find that N=5 and r=5 are all prime, satisfying the conditions. However, as I test larger odd primes, many lead r to be composite, which isn't what I want. I realize I need to establish some modular constraints, particularly that for D greater than 3, D must fit certain mod calculations. Ultimately, I find that D must align with specific mod 3 conditions to ensure 2D-1 remains prime.**Clarifying prime conditions**\n\nI'm analyzing the conditions for D based on its relationship with modular constraints. After considering odd primes, I conclude that D must be congruent to 1 mod 6. So, D being greater than 3 leads me specifically to D=3, which allows for D+2 to be 5, giving me a valid case for p, q, and r. Moving to case g=4, I see that if r+1 is a multiple of 4, this lets me express N and D in terms of each other, ultimately leading me to the conclusion that the only consecutive primes are 2 and 3.**Summarizing calculations and results**\n\nI started by checking values for D and evaluating gcd to find valid prime solutions. I confirmed pairs (5, 3, 5) and (3, 2, 7) as the only solutions. Then I shifted to a random walk problem on a toroidal grid, seeking the probability of returning to the origin after 2012 steps. After analyzing the steps' vectors and applying correlations, I derived a formula using discrete Fourier transforms to find probabilities. Finally, I formatted my answers for clarity, yielding \"(3, 2, 7); (5, 3, 5)\" and providing the exact probability as \"1/16 + 2^-1009 + 2^-2014.\"**Formatting answers and reasoning**\n\nI'm considering how to present the answers clearly. I think using fractions is better, so I'll express the probability as \"1/16 + 1/2^1009 + 1/2^2014\" and prefer \"(1/4 + 1/2^1007)^2\" for compactness. I'll ensure my reasoning text is clear and moderate in length. Regarding JSON formatting, I need to avoid trailing commas and adhere closely to valid structure. For the reasoning, I’ll summarize without revealing all the derivations, focusing on key concepts instead. This should be a satisfactory response!</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Rewrite the equation as p/q = 1 + 4/(r+1) = (r+5)/(r+1). Reduce this fraction by d = gcd(r+5, r+1) = gcd(4, r+1), so d ∈ {1,2,4}. In the reduced form we must have p = (r+5)/d and q = (r+1)/d both prime.\\n- If d = 1, then q = r+1 must be prime, but for r a prime ≥ 2, r+1 is even and > 2, hence composite; no solutions.\\n- If d = 2, then r+1 = 2q and r+5 = 2p ⇒ r = 2q−1 and p = q+2. Thus q and q+2 are twin primes and r = 2q−1 is also prime. For primes > 3, a simple congruence argument (mod 6) shows this is impossible except for q = 3, which yields p = 5 and r = 5. This triple (5,3,5) works.\\n- If d = 4, then r+1 = 4q and r+5 = 4p ⇒ r = 4q−1 and p = q+1. So q and q+1 must be consecutive primes, which only occurs for (2,3). This gives r = 7 and triple (3,2,7), which works. Hence the only prime triples are (p,q,r) = (5,3,5) and (3,2,7).\\n\\nProblem 2: Each step moves by (dx,dy) where dx,dy ∈ {+1,−1} with all four combinations equally likely, so dx and dy are independent fair ±1 random variables. After n steps, the total displacement is (Sx,Sy) where Sx and Sy are independent simple random walks with n steps of ±1. Working mod 8, the probability of being back at the original x-coordinate is P(Sx ≡ 0 mod 8), and similarly for y; independence implies the total return probability is P(Sx ≡ 0 mod 8)^2. For even n = 2012, write S = 2(k − n/2) with k ∼ Bin(n,1/2); the condition S ≡ 0 (mod 8) translates to k ≡ n/2 (mod 4). Using a standard roots-of-unity/DFT filter for binomial sums by residue class modulo 4, this probability simplifies to P(S ≡ 0 mod 8) = 1/4 + 1/2^1007 when n = 2012. Squaring for the two independent coordinates yields the final return probability (1/4 + 1/2^1007)^2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"(3,2,7); (5,3,5)\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"(1/4+1/2^1007)^2\"\n}",
