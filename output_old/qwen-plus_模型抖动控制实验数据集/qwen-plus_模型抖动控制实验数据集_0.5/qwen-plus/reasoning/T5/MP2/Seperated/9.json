Testing linear functions $ f(x) = kx $, we find $ k = 0 $ or $ k = 1 $. The zero function $ f(x) = 0 $ gives $ c = 0 $, and $ f(x) = x $ gives $ c = 1 $. However, the zero function is non-injective and leads to contradictions when considering periodicity and growth conditions. The injective solution $ f(x) = x $ satisfies all constraints, and further analysis shows that any non-trivial solution must have $ f(1) = 1 $. Thus, $ c = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find positive integers relatively prime to all terms of $ a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 $, we note that for any prime $ p $, there exists $ n $ such that $ p \\\\mid a_n $. For example, $ a_1 = 10 $ (primes 2, 5), $ a_2 = 48 $ (primes 2, 3), etc. Detailed modular analysis shows every prime divides some $ a_n $. Hence, the only positive integer with no prime factors (i.e., relatively prime to all $ a_n $) is 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
