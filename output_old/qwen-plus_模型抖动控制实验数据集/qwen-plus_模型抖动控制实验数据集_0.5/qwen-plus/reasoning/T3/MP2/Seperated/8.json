The equation $ x = 0 $ can be written as $ 1 \\\\cdot x + 0 \\\\cdot y = 0 $, so the coefficient vector is $ (1, 0) $. The Euclidean norm $ k $ is $ \\\\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 1 $. Thus, $ e = k + 1039 = 1 + 1039 = 1040 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: By analyzing the system, we find $ y = 4z $ and $ x = \\\\frac{16}{z^2} $. Substituting into the equations leads to $ z^3 = 64 $ or $ z^3 = 1 $, giving real solutions $ z = 4 $ and $ z = 1 $. Corresponding triplets are $ (1, 16, 4) $ and $ (16, 4, 1) $. Both satisfy all three equations.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1040\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(1,16,4),(16,4,1)\"\n}",
