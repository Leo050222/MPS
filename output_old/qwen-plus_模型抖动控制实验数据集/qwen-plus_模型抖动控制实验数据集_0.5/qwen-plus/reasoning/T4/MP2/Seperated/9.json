Testing small values and analyzing prime factorizations shows only n=6 satisfies the condition. n=6 has distinct prime factors 2 and 3, so k=2. Thus, e = k - 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: n must be a sum of two coprime squares with all primes ≤√n dividing ab. Checking small n: n=2 (1²+1²), primes ≤√2: none; n=5 (1²+2²), prime 2 ≤√5 divides ab=2; n=13 (2²+3²), primes 2,3 ≤√13 divide ab=6. Larger n fail as primes ≤√n exceed ab's factors.
