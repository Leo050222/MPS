Setting $x = 0$ gives $f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)|$. Setting $x = -y^2$ yields $f(0) = f(-y^2) + |y f(y)|$. Combining these, $f(-z) = 2f(0) - f(z)$ for $z \\\\geq 0$. Testing $y = 1$ leads to $f(1) = f(0) + |f(1)|$, implying $f(0) = 0$ (as negative $f(1)$ leads to contradictions). Thus, $f(0) = 0$, so $k = 0 + 4 = 4$.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize circles through 4 concyclic points among 7 arbitrary points, note that each circle must contain exactly 4 points (to avoid reducing the count via larger sets). Using combinatorial design, the maximum number of 4-point subsets with pairwise intersections ≤2 is achieved by the complement of the Fano plane's Steiner triple system (7 blocks of size 3), yielding 7 distinct circles. Any additional circle would force intersections of size ≥3, violating uniqueness. Hence, the maximum is 7.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}",
