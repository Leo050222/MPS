After 80 balls are moved from Box $A$ to Box $B$, the ratio of balls in Box $A$ to Box $B$ is now $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1$. Find $100p+q$. Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The problem involves a self-referential setup where n is the answer. Box B starts with n balls, Box A with n/2. After moving 80 balls, the ratio of A to B is analyzed. Through detailed analysis, it's determined that the greatest common divisor (g) of the unsimplified ratio's numerator and denominator is 40 (from example where n=240 leads to A=40, B=320, gcd=40). Thus, k = g + 3 = 43. Despite initial confusion about self-reference, the valid solution under problem constraints gives answer 43.\\n\\nProblem 2: The trapezoid has vertices at (0,0), (5,0), (4,4), (0,4). Midpoints of sides are connected, forming two segments: y=2 and y=-8x+20. These divide the trapezoid into four regions. Calculating areas via shoelace formula shows two regions with area 19/4 and two with 17/4. The difference d = 1/2, so 240d = 120.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"43\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"120\"\n}",
