  "math_problem": "Find all functions $f:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, such that $$f(xy+f(x^2))=xf(x+y)$$ for all reals $x, y$. Instead of determining all functions from reals to reals that satisfy the given functional equation for all real inputs, simply find $c = f(1)$, where $f(1)$ is the value at input 1 for a solution $f$ to the equation derived from analysis of the equation's structure. Determine all positive integers $k$ such that $\\gcd(k, a_n)=c$ for all $n \\geq c$, where $a_n=2^n+3^n+6^n -c$, $n\\geq 1$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the functional equation $f(xy + f(x^2)) = x f(x + y)$ for all real $x, y$. Testing constant functions, $f(x) = 0$ is a solution, giving $c = f(1) = 0$. However, linear function $f(x) = x$ also satisfies the equation, yielding $c = 1$. For the second part, if $c = 0$, $a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n$, but $\\\\gcd(k, a_n) = 0$ is impossible since gcd is always positive. Thus $c = 1$ is the only valid value. Now, $a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1$. Compute $a_n$ for small $n$: $a_1 = 10$, $a_2 = 48$, $a_3 = 250$, etc. All $a_n$ are even, so $\\\\gcd(k, a_n) = 1$ requires $k$ odd. However, for any odd prime $p$, there exists $n$ such that $p \\\\mid a_n$ (e.g., $p=5$ divides $a_1$, $p=7$ divides $a_{11}$). Thus, only $k=1$ satisfies $\\\\gcd(k, a_n) = 1$ for all $n \\\\geq 1$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
