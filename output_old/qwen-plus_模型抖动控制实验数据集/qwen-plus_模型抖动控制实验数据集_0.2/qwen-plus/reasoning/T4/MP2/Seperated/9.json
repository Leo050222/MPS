Testing small cases reveals only n=6 satisfies the condition (σ(6)=12, p(n)=3, 12/(3-1)=6). The distinct prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so k=2. Thus, e=k-1=1.\\n\\nProblem 2: For n=a²+b² with gcd(a,b)=1 and all primes ≤√n dividing ab, valid n must have ab divisible by all such primes. Checking small values: n=2 (1²+1², no primes ≤√2), n=5 (1²+2², prime 2 divides 2), n=13 (2²+3², primes 2,3 divide 6). Larger n fail as ab cannot cover all required primes (e.g., n=25 fails for prime 5). Thus, the solutions are 2, 5, 13.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2,5,13\"\n}",
