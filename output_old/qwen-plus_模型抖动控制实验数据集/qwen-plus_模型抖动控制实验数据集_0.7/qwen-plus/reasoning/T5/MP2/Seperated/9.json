Testing $ x = 1 $ gives $ f(y + c) = f(y + 1) $, implying periodicity if $ c \\\\neq 1 $. However, analyzing $ f(f(x^2)) = x f(x) $ (from $ y = 0 $) shows that non-zero solutions must be injective. For injective $ f $, $ f(y + c) = f(y + 1) $ forces $ c = 1 $. The zero function ($ c = 0 $) is a solution but is not injective. However, the problem specifies deriving $ c $ from structural analysis, which focuses on non-trivial solutions. Further, the zero function leads to contradictions in periodicity constraints when combined with $ f(2t) = 2f(t) $, leaving $ c = 1 $ as the valid value.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find positive integers relatively prime to all $ a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 $. Computing small $ a_n $ reveals primes like 2, 3, 5 divide terms. For any prime $ p $, the equation $ (2^n + 1)(3^n + 1) \\\\equiv 2 \\\\mod p $ has solutions (e.g., $ p = 7 $ at $ n = 5 $, $ p = 11 $ at $ n = 8 $). Thus, every prime divides some $ a_n $. The only positive integer with no prime factors is 1, which is relatively prime to all $ a_n $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
