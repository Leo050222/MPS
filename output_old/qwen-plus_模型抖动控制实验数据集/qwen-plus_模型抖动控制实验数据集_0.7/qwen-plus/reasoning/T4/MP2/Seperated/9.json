Testing small values shows $n=6$ (prime factors 2 and 3) satisfies the condition. Further analysis confirms no other $n$ works. The distinct prime factors of $n=6$ are 2 and 3, so $k=2$, giving $e = k - 1 = 1$. Problem 2: $n = a^2 + b^2$ with $\\\\gcd(a,b)=1$ and all primes $p \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{n}$ dividing $ab$. Checking small values: $n=2$ (primes $\\\\leq \\\\sqrt{2}$: none), $n=5$ (prime 2 divides $ab=2$), $n=13$ (primes 2,3 divide $ab=6$). Larger candidates fail as additional primes $\\\\leq \\\\sqrt{n}$ do not divide $ab$. Thus, valid $n$ are 2, 5, 13.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2,5,13\"\n}",
