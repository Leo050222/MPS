Setting $ y = 0 $ gives no new information. Testing constant functions, $ f(x) = 0 $ satisfies the equation. For non-constant solutions, assume $ f(x) = kx $ with $ k \\\\geq 0 $. Substituting into the equation confirms it works, and $ f(0) = 0 $. Further analysis shows $ f(0) $ must be 0 for all valid solutions. Thus, $ k = f(0) + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The maximum number of circles through 4 concyclic points from 7 arbitrary points is determined by combinatorial geometry. Using a 2-(7,4,2) design (complement of the Fano plane), each pair of circles shares at most 2 points, allowing 7 distinct circles each containing exactly 4 points. Geometric constraints confirm this is achievable, and no more than 7 circles are possible due to pairwise intersection limits.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}",
