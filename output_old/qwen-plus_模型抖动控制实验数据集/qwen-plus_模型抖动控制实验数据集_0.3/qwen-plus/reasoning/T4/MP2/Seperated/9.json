Testing small cases, n=6 (prime factors 2 and 3) satisfies σ(6)=12, p(n)=3, and 12/(3-1)=6. Analysis shows no other integers satisfy the condition. The distinct prime factors of n=6 are 2 and 3, so k=2. Thus, e=k-1=1.\\n\\nProblem 2: n must be a sum of coprime squares a²+b² where all primes ≤√n divide ab. Checking small n: n=2 (1²+1², no primes ≤√2), n=5 (1²+2², prime 2 divides 2), and n=13 (2²+3², primes 2,3 divide 6) satisfy the conditions. Larger n fail as required primes exceed ab's factors.
