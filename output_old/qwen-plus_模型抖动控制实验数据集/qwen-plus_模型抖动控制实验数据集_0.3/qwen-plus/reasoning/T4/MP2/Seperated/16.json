Setting $ x = 0 $ gives $ f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)| $. Setting $ x = -y^2 $ yields $ f(0) = f(-y^2) + |y f(y)| $. Combining these shows $ f(y^2) + f(-y^2) = 2f(0) $. Assuming $ f(x) = ax + b $, substitution reveals $ b = 0 $ and $ a \\\\geq 0 $, so $ f(0) = 0 $. Further analysis confirms $ f(0) = 0 $ is the only solution, hence $ k = 0 + 4 = 4 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: For 7 points in the plane, maximize circles through 4 concyclic points. Each circle with $ m \\\\geq 4 $ points contributes 1 circle. To maximize, ensure no 5+ points are concyclic (as they reduce distinct circles). Using combinatorial design, the maximum number of 4-point subsets with pairwise intersections $ \\\\leq 2 $ (since two circles intersect in at most 2 points) is bounded by $ 6|F| \\\\leq 42 $ (from double counting pairs), giving $ |F| \\\\leq 7 $. A valid construction with 7 such subsets exists (e.g., specific 4-point sets with pairwise intersections of size 2), achievable geometrically. Thus, the maximum number of circles is 7.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}",
