After 80 balls are moved from Box $A$ to Box $B$, the ratio of balls in Box $A$ to Box $B$ is now $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1$. Find $100p+q$. Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio."

Two line segments are drawn, connecting the midpoints of opposite sides of $T$ and dividing $T$ into 4 regions. If the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest of these regions is $d$, compute $240 d$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The ratio after moving balls is simplified to p/q with gcd(p, q)=1. Thus, g=1 and k = 1 + 3 = 4. Despite the self-referential setup, the problem specifies the ratio is simplified, making g=1 regardless of n. Problem 2: The right trapezoid has bases 5 and 4, height 4. Midlines divide it into four regions. Areas calculated via shoelace formula show largest area 19/4 and smallest 17/4. Difference d = 1/2, so 240d = 120.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"120\"\n}",
