The equation $ x = 0 $ can be written as $ 1x + 0y = 0 $, so the coefficient vector is $ (1, 0) $. The Euclidean norm $ k $ is $ \\\\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 1 $. Thus, $ e = k + 1039 = 1 + 1039 = 1040 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: By analyzing the system, we find $ y = 4z $ from the first two equations. Substituting into the third equation and solving leads to $ z = 4 $ or $ z = 1 $. For $ z = 4 $, $ y = 16 $, $ x = 1 $; for $ z = 1 $, $ y = 4 $, $ x = 16 $. Both triplets satisfy all equations.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1040\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(1,16,4),(16,4,1)\"\n}",
