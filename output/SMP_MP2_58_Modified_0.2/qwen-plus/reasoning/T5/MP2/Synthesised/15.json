Instead of finding all monic polynomials with integer coefficients such that there exists a positive integer $N$ where for every prime $p>N$ with $f(p)$ a positive integer, $p$ divides $2(f(p)!)+1$, simply find $d = k - 2$, where $k$ is the absolute value of the constant term in the unique linear monic polynomial with integer coefficients that satisfies the condition. Does there exist a function $f: \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R $  satisfying the following conditions: \n(i) for each real $y$  there is a real  $x$ such that $f(x)=y$ , and \n(ii)  $f(f(x)) = (x - d)f(x) + 2$ for all real $x$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, consider the linear monic polynomial $ f(x) = x + c $ with integer coefficients. The condition requires $ p \\\\mid 2(f(p)!) + 1 $ for all sufficiently large primes $ p $. For $ f(p) = p + c $, if $ c \\\\geq 0 $, $ (p + c)! \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod p $, leading to $ 2(f(p)!) + 1 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod p \\\\neq 0 $. For $ c < 0 $, let $ c = -m $ ($ m > 0 $), so $ f(p) = p - m $. Using Wilson's theorem, $ (p - 1)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. Expanding $ (p - 1)! = (p - 1)(p - 2)\\\\cdots(p - m + 1)(p - m)! $, we get $ (-1)^{m-1}(m-1)!(p - m)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. Solving $ 2(p - m)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $ leads to $ (m - 1)! = 2 $, which holds for $ m = 3 $. Thus, $ f(x) = x - 3 $, constant term $ -3 $, so $ k = | -3 | = 3 $, and $ d = k - 2 = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, check if a function $ f: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} $ exists satisfying (i) surjectivity and (ii) $ f(f(x)) = (x - 1)f(x) + 2 $. Known values: $ f(0) = 2 $, $ f(1) = 0 $, $ f(2) = 0 $, $ f(-1) = 1 $. The functional equation holds for these values. Using the axiom of choice, partition $ \\\\mathbb{R} $ into chains/cycles (e.g., $ -1 \\\\to 1 \\\\to 0 \\\\leftrightarrow 2 $) and define $ f $ recursively to satisfy the equation while ensuring surjectivity. No contradictions arise, so such a function exists.\",\n    \"answer\": \"yes\"\n}",
