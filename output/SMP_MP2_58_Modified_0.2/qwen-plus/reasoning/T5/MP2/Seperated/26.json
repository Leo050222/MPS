Instead of finding all functions satisfying the given functional equation and limit condition, simply find $k = f(1) + 1$, where $f(1)$ is the constant factor in the scaling relation $f(f(y)) = f(1) y$ derived from the functional equation."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Setting x=1 in the functional equation gives f(f(y)) = y f(1). Let c = f(1), so f(f(y)) = c y. Substituting y=1 gives f(c x) = f(x) for all x. Since f is injective (proven via the functional equation), c x = x for all x, implying c=1. Thus, k = f(1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Verification with f(x) = 1/x satisfies the equation and limit condition.\\n\\nProblem 2: The product (x₁²+1)...(x₄²+1) equals P(i)P(-i) = (1 - b + d)² + (c - a)². Let t = b - d ≥ 5, so the expression becomes (t - 1)² + (c - a)². Minimizing this requires t=5 (smallest allowed) and c - a=0. For roots all 1, P(x)=(x-1)⁴ gives b=6, d=1 (t=5), c=-4, a=-4 (c - a=0). The product is (5-1)² + 0 = 16, which is minimal.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"16\"\n}",
