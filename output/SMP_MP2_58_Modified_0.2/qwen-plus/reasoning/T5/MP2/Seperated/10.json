The problem instructs to compute $ k = d - 1 $, where $ d $ is this gcd. Thus, $ k = 1 - 1 = 0 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize $ S = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{n}{2^n} (a_1 a_2 \\\\cdots a_n)^{1/n} $ under $ \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty a_k = 1 $, consider geometric sequences. Assuming $ a_n = 3 \\\\cdot 4^{-n} $, the sum constraint is satisfied. The product term simplifies to $ (\\\\prod_{k=1}^n a_k)^{1/n} = 3 \\\\cdot 2^{-(n+1)} $. Substituting into $ S $, the series becomes $ \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{n}{4^n} $. Using the formula for $ \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty n r^n = \\\\frac{r}{(1-r)^2} $ with $ r = \\\\frac{1}{4} $, the sum evaluates to $ \\\\frac{4}{9} $. Thus, $ S = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{4}{9} = \\\\frac{2}{3} $.
