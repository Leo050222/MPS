  "math_problem": "Determine the form of $n$ such that $2^n + 2$ is divisible by $n$ where $n$ is less than 100. Instead of determining the possible values of $n$ less than 100 for which $n$ divides $2^n + 2$, simply find $n$, where $n$ is the largest positive integer less than 100 satisfying this divisibility condition. Determine all pairs $(h, s)$ of positive integers with the following property: If one draws $h$ horizontal lines and another $s$ lines which satisfy (i) they are not horizontal, (ii) no two of them are parallel, (iii) no three of the $h+s$ lines are concurrent, then the number of regions formed by these $h+s$ lines is $n + 1926$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find the largest n < 100 such that n divides 2^n + 2. Testing values, n=66 works (2^66 + 2 ≡ 0 mod 66) and is the largest under 100. Next, the number of regions formed by h horizontal lines and s non-horizontal lines (no two parallel, no three concurrent) is given by R = 1 + h(s+1) + s(s+1)/2. Setting R = 66 + 1926 = 1992, we solve (s+1)(2h + s) = 3982. Factoring 3982 = 2×11×181, valid positive integer pairs (h,s) are found by checking factor pairs: (s+1, 2h+s) = (2,1991), (11,362), (22,181), yielding (h,s) = (995,1), (176,10), (80,21).\",\n    \"answer\": \"(995,1), (176,10), (80,21)\"\n}",
