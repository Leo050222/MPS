  "math_problem": "Let $f: \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function satisfying $f(x y)=f(x)+f(y)+1$ for all positive reals $x, y$. If $f(2)=0$, compute $f(2015)$. Instead of computing the value of $f$ at 2015, simply find $m = g(2) + 9$, where $g(x) = f(x) + 1$ is the continuous function satisfying $g(xy) = g(x) + g(y)$ for all positive reals $x, y$. $m$ points are equally spaced on a circle. A graph is a set of segments (possibly empty) drawn between pairs of points, so that every two points are joined by either zero or one segments. Two graphs are considered the same if we can obtain one from the other by rearranging the points. Let $N$ denote the number of graphs with the property that for any two points, there exists a path from one to the other among the segments of the graph. Estimate the value of $N$. If your answer is a positive integer $A$, your score on this problem will be the larger of 0 and $\\lfloor 20-5|\\ln (A / N)|\\rfloor$. Otherwise, your score will be zero.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, define $ g(x) = f(x) + 1 $. The functional equation $ f(xy) = f(x) + f(y) + 1 $ transforms to $ g(xy) = g(x) + g(y) $, which is Cauchy's logarithmic functional equation. Since $ g $ is continuous, $ g(x) = k \\\\ln x $. Given $ f(2) = 0 $, we find $ g(2) = f(2) + 1 = 1 $. Thus, $ m = g(2) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10 $. \\n\\nNext, $ m = 10 $ points on a circle correspond to unlabeled graphs (up to isomorphism). The problem asks for the number $ N $ of connected unlabeled graphs on 10 vertices. From known combinatorial results (OEIS A001349), the number of connected unlabeled graphs on $ n $ vertices for $ n = 10 $ is 11716571.\",\n    \"answer\": \"11716571\"\n}",
