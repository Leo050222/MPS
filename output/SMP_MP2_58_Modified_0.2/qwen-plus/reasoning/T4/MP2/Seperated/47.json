Given two valid choices at level 1 (f(16) = 2 or 15 when f(1)=2), we compute assignments up to level 2. For f(16)=2, f(4) and f(13) each have 2 choices (4 total); for f(16)=15, f(4)=f(13)=0 (1 choice). Thus a₂ = 4 + 1 = 5, so k = 5 + 4 = 9.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let roots of f(x)=x³+x+1 be α, β, γ. Using Vieta's formulas: α+β+γ=0, αβ+αγ+βγ=1, αβγ=-1. The polynomial g(x) with roots α², β², γ² has coefficients: sum of roots = -2, sum of products = 1, product = 1. Thus g(x)=x³+2x²+x-1.
