Considering all positive integers $N$ with this property, what is the smallest positive integer $a$ that occurs in any of these expressions? Instead of identifying the minimal initial term in the unique representation of such $N$ as a sum of consecutive positive integers, simply find $d = a - 15$, where $a$ is the smallest positive integer serving as the initial term in any such representation derived from the condition that $N$ admits no other decompositions into consecutive sums for $k>1$."

For $N$ to have no other representations as a sum of $k > 1$ consecutive positive integers, $N$ must be of the form $2^s \\\\cdot 2017$ where $s$ is minimal such that $a = 2^s - 1008 > 0$ and no other $k > 1$ works. The smallest $s$ satisfying $2^s > 1008$ and ensuring no other $k$ is $s = 10$, giving $a = 1024 - 1008 = 16$. Thus, $d = a - 15 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The condition requires that for all $m$ coprime to $n$, the map $k \\\\mapsto mk \\\\mod n$ is a square of some permutation. This holds if and only if $n$ is 1, 2, or twice a prime power of an odd prime. For $n = 1$ and $n = 2$, it trivially holds. For $n = 2p^k$ ($p$ odd prime, $k \\\\geq 1$), the cycle structure of the permutation induced by $m$ has even counts of cycles of even length, ensuring a square root exists. Other $n$ fail due to odd cycle counts for some $m$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"n = 1, 2, or twice an odd prime power\"\n}",
