Setting $ y = 1 $ gives $ f(1) = f(0) + |f(1)| $. If $ f(1) \\\\geq 0 $, this implies $ f(0) = 0 $. If $ f(1) < 0 $, $ f(1) = f(0) - f(1) \\\\Rightarrow f(0) = 2f(1) $, but $ f(t) \\\\geq 0 $ for $ t \\\\geq 0 $ (from $ f(t) = f(t/2 + t/2) = 2f(t/2) $), so $ f(1) \\\\geq 0 $, forcing $ f(0) = 0 $. Thus, $ k = f(0) + 4 = 4 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The maximum number of circles through 4 concyclic points from 7 arbitrary points is determined by combinatorial geometry. Using design theory, the symmetric 2-(7,4,2) design (complement of the Fano plane) allows 7 circles, each containing exactly 4 points, with any two circles intersecting in 2 points. Geometric constraints (three points define a unique circle, two circles intersect in at most 2 points) limit the maximum to 7, as verified by triple counting and design realizability.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}",
