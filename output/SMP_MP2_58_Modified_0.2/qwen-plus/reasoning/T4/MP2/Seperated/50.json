Instead of computing the value of $f$ at 2015, simply find $m = g(2) + 9$, where $g(x) = f(x) + 1$ is the continuous function satisfying $g(xy) = g(x) + g(y)$ for all positive reals $x, y$."

A graph is a set of segments (possibly empty) drawn between pairs of points, so that every two points are joined by either zero or one segments. Two graphs are considered the same if we can obtain one from the other by rearranging the points. Let $N$ denote the number of graphs with the property that for any two points, there exists a path from one to the other among the segments of the graph. Estimate the value of $N$. If your answer is a positive integer $A$, your score on this problem will be the larger of 0 and $\\lfloor 20-5|\\ln (A / N)|\\rfloor$. Otherwise, your score will be zero."

The functional equation $ f(xy) = f(x) + f(y) + 1 $ transforms to $ g(xy) = g(x) + g(y) $, which is Cauchy's logarithmic equation. Given $ f(2) = 0 $, we have $ g(2) = f(2) + 1 = 1 $. Thus, $ m = g(2) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of connected labeled graphs on 10 vertices is 34,496,488,594,816 (OEIS A001349). Considering graphs up to dihedral symmetry (20 symmetries), the dominant term in Burnside's lemma is the identity element. Since almost all connected graphs are asymmetric, $ N \\\\approx \\\\frac{34,496,488,594,816}{20} = 1,724,824,429,740.8 $.
