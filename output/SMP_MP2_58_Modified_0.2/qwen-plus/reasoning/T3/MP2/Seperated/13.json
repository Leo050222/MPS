Find the number of anti-palindromes less than $3^{12}$ such that no two consecutive digits in base 3 are equal. Instead of determining the total count of qualifying anti-palindromes, simply find $k = b_1 + 27$, where $b_1$ is the number of valid anti-palindromes with one digit derived from the anti-palindrome condition and the no consecutive equal digits constraint."

This is the only single-digit anti-palindrome (digits 0 and 2 fail the condition). The no-consecutive-equal-digits constraint is vacuously true for single-digit numbers. Thus, $b_1 = 1$, and $k = 1 + 27 = 28$. Problem 2: Constructing a valid circle of ten numbers where each number is one more than the gcd of its neighbors, the repeating pattern [2, 3, 4, 3, 2] works when doubled for ten elements. Each segment satisfies the condition, and the total sum is $2 \\\\times (2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2) = 28$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"28\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"28\"\n}",
