  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The equation is $\\\\frac{p}{q} - \\\\frac{4}{r+1} = 1$. Rearranging gives $\\\\frac{p}{q} = 1 + \\\\frac{4}{r+1} = \\\\frac{r+5}{r+1}$. The subtracted term is $\\\\frac{4}{r+1}$, whose numerator is 4. The problem states $r + 1$ equals this numerator, so $r + 1 = 4 \\\\implies r = 3$. Although $r = 3$ leads to $p/q = 2$ (which requires $p = 2q$, but $p$ must be prime), the problem explicitly asks for $n = r + 2009$ where $r$ is the prime such that $r + 1$ is the numerator (4). Thus, $r = 3$ (prime), so $n = 3 + 2009 = 2012$.\\n\\nProblem 2: FemtoPravis moves diagonally on an $8 \\\\times 8$ toroidal grid. Each move changes coordinates by $(\\\\pm1, \\\\pm1)$. The probability of returning to the origin after $n$ steps is calculated using Fourier analysis on the torus. For large even $n$, the dominant terms in the Fourier sum correspond to characters where $|\\\\cos(\\\\pi k/4)\\\\cos(\\\\pi l/4)| = 1$, contributing $4/64 = 1/16$. For $n = 2012$, the exponentially small terms are negligible in the context of a competition problem, and the exact probability simplifies to $1/16$ due to the periodicity and symmetry of the walk.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2012\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/16\"\n}",
