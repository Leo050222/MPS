Instead of counting the positive integers $a$ such that the given quadratic polynomial has an integer root, simply find $k = a + 7$, where $a$ is a positive integer such that $x^{2} - a x + a$ has an integer root."

However, the two dice are not fair, meaning that they can land on each face with different probability. Marisa rolls the two dice and calculates their sum. Given that the sum is 2 with probability 0.04, and 12 with probability 0.01, the maximum possible probability of the sum being 7 is $p$. Compute $\\lfloor 100 p\\rfloor$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let $ r $ be an integer root of $ x^2 - ax + a = 0 $. Then $ r^2 - ar + a = 0 \\\\implies a = \\\\frac{r^2}{r - 1} $. For $ a $ to be a positive integer, $ r - 1 $ must divide $ r^2 $. Rewriting $ \\\\frac{r^2}{r - 1} = r + 1 + \\\\frac{1}{r - 1} $, we find $ r - 1 $ must divide 1. Thus, $ r - 1 = \\\\pm 1 \\\\implies r = 2 $ or $ r = 0 $. For $ r = 2 $, $ a = 4 $ (positive integer). For $ r = 0 $, $ a = 0 $ (invalid as $ a $ must be positive). Hence, the only valid $ a $ is 4. The problem asks for $ k = a + 7 $, so $ k = 4 + 7 = 11 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let $ p_i $ be the probability of rolling $ i $ on each die. Given $ p_1^2 = 0.04 \\\\implies p_1 = 0.2 $ and $ p_6^2 = 0.01 \\\\implies p_6 = 0.1 $. The sum 7 probability is $ 2(p_1p_6 + p_2p_5 + p_3p_4) $. With $ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 = 1 $, we have $ p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 0.7 $. To maximize $ p_2p_5 + p_3p_4 $, set $ p_3 = p_4 = 0 $ and $ p_2 = p_5 = 0.35 $ (or vice versa), yielding $ p_2p_5 + p_3p_4 = 0.1225 $. Thus, the maximum sum 7 probability is $ 2(0.2 \\\\cdot 0.1 + 0.1225) = 0.285 $. Therefore, $ \\\\lfloor 100 \\\\cdot 0.285 \\\\rfloor = 28 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"28\"\n}",
