Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing the sum of all possible totals and the associated $100m + n$, simply find $k = z - 2$, where $z$ is the common value taken by the two equal variables in the solution where exactly two of the variables are equal."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We consider the case where exactly two variables are equal, say x = y ≠ z. Solving the system leads to a cubic equation with roots t = 1, 1/2, 3. The roots t = 1 and t = 1/2 result in all three variables equal (invalid for exactly two equal), while t = 3 gives x = y = 3 and z = -1/3 (valid). The common value of the two equal variables is 3. Thus, k = z - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The polygons are regular with vertex counts from their names: ICAO (4), VENTI (5), ALBEDO (6). Shared vertices constrain their geometry. IN = 1 fixes the pentagon's scale. The square and hexagon orientations (clockwise/counterclockwise) lead to two distinct configurations for O relative to N, resulting in two possible values for ON.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\"\n}",
