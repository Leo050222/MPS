Compute Q(r) = (-1)² + 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2. Then k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Suppose such an irrational α > 1 exists. For floor(αⁿ) ≡ 0 mod 2017, αⁿ must lie in [2017kₙ, 2017kₙ + 1) for integers kₙ. For n=1, α ∈ [2017, 2018). For n=2, α² ∈ [2017k₂, 2017k₂ + 1), requiring α ∈ [2017, sqrt(2017² + 1)) ≈ [2017, 2017 + ε). Continuing, intervals for α shrink to α = 2017 (rational). Any irrational α > 2017 would eventually have αⁿ fall outside [2017kₙ, 2017kₙ + 1) for some n, violating the condition. Thus, no such irrational α exists.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
