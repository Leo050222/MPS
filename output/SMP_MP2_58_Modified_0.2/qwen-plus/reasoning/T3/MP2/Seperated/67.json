The condition $ \\\\varphi(2019n) = \\\\varphi(n^2) $ simplifies using properties of Euler's totient function. Factoring $ 2019 = 3 \\\\times 673 $, we analyze prime exponents in $ n $. For $ \\\\varphi(2019n) = \\\\varphi(n^2) $, the exponents of primes 3 and 673 in $ n $ must be exactly 1, and $ n $ cannot have other prime factors. Thus, $ n = 2019 $, so $ \\\\gcd(2019, n) = 2019 $. Therefore, $ k = 2019 - 2018 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Define $ b_n = a_n + 1 $. The recurrence transforms to $ b_{n+1} = \\\\frac{b_n^2}{b_{n-1}} $, a multiplicative sequence. With $ a_1 = 1 $, $ b_1 = 2 $, and $ a_9 = 7 $, $ b_9 = 8 $. Solving $ b_9 = \\\\frac{b_2^8}{128} = 8 $ gives $ b_2^8 = 1024 $. The sequence $ b_n $ follows $ b_n = \\\\frac{b_2^{n-1}}{2^{n-2}} $. For $ n=5 $, $ b_5 = \\\\frac{b_2^4}{8} $. Since $ b_2^4 = 32 $, $ b_5 = 4 $, so $ a_5 = 3 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
