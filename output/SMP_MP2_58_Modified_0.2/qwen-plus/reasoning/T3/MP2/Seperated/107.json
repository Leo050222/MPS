Assuming $m < 0$ and $n > 0$, let $m = -a$ ($a > 0$), leading to $a^5 + n^5 = 16an$. Testing small values, $a = 2$, $n = 2$ satisfies the equation: $32 + 32 = 64 = 16 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 2$. Thus, $m = -2$, $n = 2$ is a solution with opposite signs. Here, $n = 2$, so $k = n - 1 = 1$. No other solutions with opposite signs exist.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given polynomial $x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48$ with roots $p < q < r$, we minimize $\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$ under $pqr = 48$. Using Lagrange multipliers, the minimum occurs when $q = 2p$, $r = 3p$, leading to $p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$.
