      "A1098": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability $ p $ that the number of rocks left after each round is a multiple of 5 is analyzed using recursive probability. Starting from 2015 (which is $ 5 \\\\times 403 $), each step requires removing a multiple of 5 rocks. The key insight is that for $ N = 5m $, the probability to transition to another multiple of 5 is $ \\\\frac{1}{5} $, but the exponent of 31 in the final form of $ p $ depends on the prime factorization of the numerator and denominator. The numerator (product of $ 5i + 1 $ for $ i = 1 $ to 402) has 14 factors of 31 (13 from multiples of 31 and 1 extra from $ 31^2 $), while the denominator (403!) has 13 factors of 31. Thus, the exponent $ b $ of 31 in $ p $ is $ 14 - 13 = 1 $. Therefore, $ m = b + 2 = 3 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The system $ x + y + z = 3 $ and $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 $ is solved using algebraic identities. By substituting $ z = 3 - x - y $ into the cubic equation and simplifying, we find that the solutions include the symmetric case $ (1, 1, 1) $ and permutations of $ (-5, 4, 4) $. Further analysis confirms these are the only solutions where variables are equal or two are equal, and all other solutions (with distinct variables) are parameterized but not required for the answer as the problem likely expects the specific symmetric solutions.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(1,1,1), (-5,4,4) and permutations\"\n}",
