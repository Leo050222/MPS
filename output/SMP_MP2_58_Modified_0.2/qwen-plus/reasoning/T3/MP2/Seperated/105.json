By computing the sequence, we observe that primes repeat in blocks. The primes and their term counts are: 3 (4 terms), 5 (4 terms), 7 (6 terms), 11 (6 terms), 13 (6 terms), 17 (6 terms), 19 (6 terms), 23 (6 terms), 29 (6 terms), 31 (6 terms), 37 (6 terms), 41 (6 terms), 43 (6 terms), 47 (6 terms), 53 (6 terms), 59 (6 terms), 61 (6 terms). The 98th and 99th terms are both 61, so their sum is 122.\\n\\nProblem 2: Alice aims to maximize the minimal distance to the nearest perfect square after 100 operations (add 1 or square). The optimal strategy is to add 1 twice, then square four times to reach 65536 (6 operations), followed by adding 94 times to get 65630. The nearest squares are 256²=65536 (distance 94) and 257²=66049 (distance 419), so the minimal distance is 94.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"122\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"94\"\n}",
