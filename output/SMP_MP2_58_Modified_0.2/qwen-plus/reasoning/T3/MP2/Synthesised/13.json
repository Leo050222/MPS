  "math_problem": "Define a number to be an anti-palindrome if, when written in base 3 as $a_{n} a_{n-1} \\ldots a_{0}$, then $a_{i}+a_{n-i}=2$ for any $0 \\leq i \\leq n$. Find the number of anti-palindromes less than $3^{12}$ such that no two consecutive digits in base 3 are equal. Instead of determining the total count of qualifying anti-palindromes, simply find $k = b_1 + 27$, where $b_1$ is the number of valid anti-palindromes with one digit derived from the anti-palindrome condition and the no consecutive equal digits constraint. Ten positive integers are arranged around a circle. Each number is one more than the greatest common divisor of its two neighbors. What is the sum of the ten numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves ten positive integers arranged in a circle where each number is one more than the greatest common divisor (gcd) of its two neighbors. To solve this, we analyze the constraints:\\n\\n- Each number $ x_i = 1 + \\\\gcd(x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}) $.\\n- All numbers must be at least 2 since $ \\\\gcd \\\\geq 1 $.\\n\\nKey observations:\\n- If a number is 2, its neighbors must be coprime (gcd = 1).\\n- If a number is 3, its neighbors must have gcd = 2 (both even).\\n- If a number is 4, its neighbors must have gcd = 3 (both multiples of 3).\\n\\nThrough pattern analysis and testing configurations, a valid sequence is found: **[4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2, 3]**. This sequence satisfies all conditions:\\n- Each 4 is between two 3s (gcd = 3 ⇒ 4 = 1 + 3).\\n- Each 3 is between a 4 and a 2 or a 2 and a 4 (gcd = 2 ⇒ 3 = 1 + 2).\\n- Each 2 is between a 3 and a 2 or a 2 and a 3 (gcd = 1 ⇒ 2 = 1 + 1).\\n\\nSumming the sequence: 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = **28**.\\n\\nThis configuration is consistent with the problem's constraints and is the minimal valid solution for ten numbers in a circle.\",\n    \"answer\": \"28\"\n}",
