  "math_problem": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form. Determine all the roots, real or complex, of the system of simultaneous equations $x + y + z = m$, $x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = m$, $x^{m} + y^{m} + z^{m} = m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, we analyze the probability problem. The initial pile has 2015 rocks, which is a multiple of 5 (2015 = 5×403). Let $ q(m) = p(5m) $, where $ p(n) $ is the probability that all subsequent removals leave multiples of 5. The recurrence relation for $ q(m) $ is $ q(m) = \\\\frac{1}{5m} \\\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} q(k) $, with $ q(0) = 1 $. \\n\\nTo find the exponent $ b $ of 31 in $ p = q(403) $, we examine the numerator and denominator of $ q(403) $. The numerator is the product $ \\\\prod_{k=1}^{402} (5k + 1) $, and the denominator is $ 5^{403} \\\\cdot 403! $. \\n\\n- **Numerator analysis**: Terms $ 5k + 1 $ divisible by 31 occur when $ k \\\\equiv 6 \\\\mod 31 $. There are 13 such terms (for $ k = 6, 37, \\\\dots, 378 $). Among these, $ k = 192 $ gives $ 5k + 1 = 961 = 31^2 $, contributing an extra factor of 31. Thus, the exponent of 31 in the numerator is $ 12 \\\\times 1 + 1 \\\\times 2 = 14 $.\\n- **Denominator analysis**: The exponent of 31 in $ 403! $ is $ \\\\lfloor 403/31 \\\\rfloor = 13 $ (since $ 31 \\\\times 13 = 403 $).\\n\\nThus, $ b = 14 - 13 = 1 $. Then $ m = b + 2 = 3 $.\\n\\nNext, solve the system:\\n- $ x + y + z = 3 $\\n- $ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3 $\\n- $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 $\\n\\nUsing symmetric sums:\\n- $ s_1 = x + y + z = 3 $\\n- $ s_2 = xy + yz + zx = \\\\frac{s_1^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)}{2} = 3 $\\n- $ s_3 = xyz = \\\\frac{x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - s_1^3 + 3s_1s_2}{3} = 1 $\\n\\nThe characteristic polynomial is $ t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t - 1 = (t - 1)^3 $, so all roots are $ t = 1 $ (with multiplicity 3). The only solution to the system is $ x = y = z = 1 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
