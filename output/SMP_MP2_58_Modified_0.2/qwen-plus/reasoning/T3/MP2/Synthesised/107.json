Suppose $x^{3}-a x^{2}+b x-48$ is a polynomial with three positive roots $p, q$, and $r$ such that $p<q<r$. What is the minimum possible value of $k / p+2 / q+3 / r$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the Diophantine equation $m^5 - n^5 = 16mn$ for integer pairs with opposite signs. Assume $m < 0$ and $n > 0$, let $m = -k$ ($k > 0$), leading to $k^5 + n^5 = 16kn$. Testing small integers, the only solution is $k = 2$, $n = 2$, so $m = -2$, $n = 2$. Thus, $k = n - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nNext, consider the polynomial $x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48$ with roots $p < q < r$. By Vieta, $pqr = 48$. Minimize $\\\\frac{k}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r} = \\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$.\\n\\nUsing Lagrange multipliers, the minimum occurs when $q = 2p$, $r = 3p$, giving $pqr = 6p^3 = 48 \\\\Rightarrow p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$. The value is $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{3}{2}$.\\n\\nChecking integer triples confirms this is the minimum.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3/2\"\n}",
