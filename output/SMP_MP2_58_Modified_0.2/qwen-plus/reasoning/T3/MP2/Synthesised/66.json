  "math_problem": "For how many positive integers $a$ does the polynomial $x^{2}-a x+a$ have an integer root? Instead of counting the positive integers $a$ such that the given quadratic polynomial has an integer root, simply find $k = a + 7$, where $a$ is a positive integer such that $x^{2} - a x + a$ has an integer root. Marisa has two identical cubical dice labeled with the numbers \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\). However, the two dice are not fair, meaning that they can land on each face with different probability. Marisa rolls the two dice and calculates their sum. Given that the sum is 2 with probability 0.04, and 12 with probability 0.01, the maximum possible probability of the sum being $k$ is $p$. Compute $\\lfloor 100 p \\rfloor$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we proceed in two main parts: first determining the value of $ k = a + 7 $ where $ a $ is a positive integer such that the polynomial $ x^2 - ax + a $ has an integer root, and then using this to compute the maximum possible probability of the sum being $ k $ with two non-fair dice.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Part 1: Finding $ a $ such that $ x^2 - ax + a $ has an integer root**\\n\\nLet $ r $ be an integer root of the quadratic equation $ x^2 - ax + a = 0 $. Substituting $ r $ into the equation gives:\\n\\n$$\\nr^2 - ar + a = 0 \\\\Rightarrow a(r - 1) = r^2 \\\\Rightarrow a = \\\\frac{r^2}{r - 1}\\n$$\\n\\nFor $ a $ to be a positive integer, $ r - 1 $ must divide $ r^2 $. Rewriting:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{r^2}{r - 1} = r + 1 + \\\\frac{1}{r - 1}\\n$$\\n\\nThis expression is an integer only if $ \\\\frac{1}{r - 1} $ is an integer, which implies $ r - 1 \\\\mid 1 $. The divisors of 1 are $ \\\\pm 1 $, so:\\n\\n- If $ r - 1 = 1 \\\\Rightarrow r = 2 $, then $ a = \\\\frac{4}{1} = 4 $\\n- If $ r - 1 = -1 \\\\Rightarrow r = 0 $, then $ a = \\\\frac{0}{-1} = 0 $ (not positive)\\n\\nThus, the only valid positive integer $ a $ is $ 4 $.\\n\\nTherefore, $ k = a + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Part 2: Maximum Probability of Sum Being $ k = 11 $**\\n\\nMarisa rolls two identical cubical dice labeled $ \\\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\\\} $, but they are not fair. Let $ p_i $ denote the probability that a die shows face $ i $, for $ i = 1 $ to $ 6 $. Since the dice are identical, both have the same probabilities.\\n\\nWe are given:\\n- $ P(\\\\text{sum} = 2) = p_1^2 = 0.04 \\\\Rightarrow p_1 = 0.2 $\\n- $ P(\\\\text{sum} = 12) = p_6^2 = 0.01 \\\\Rightarrow p_6 = 0.1 $\\n\\nThe total probability must satisfy:\\n\\n$$\\np_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 = 1 \\\\Rightarrow p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 1 - 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.7\\n$$\\n\\nWe want to maximize the probability of the sum being $ k = 11 $, which occurs when one die shows 5 and the other shows 6 (or vice versa). Thus:\\n\\n$$\\nP(\\\\text{sum} = 11) = 2 \\\\cdot p_5 \\\\cdot p_6 = 2 \\\\cdot p_5 \\\\cdot 0.1 = 0.2 \\\\cdot p_5\\n$$\\n\\nTo maximize this, we need to maximize $ p_5 $, subject to $ p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 0.7 $ and all $ p_i \\\\geq 0 $. The maximum occurs when $ p_2 = p_3 = p_4 = 0 $, so $ p_5 = 0.7 $.\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$$\\nP(\\\\text{sum} = 11) = 0.2 \\\\cdot 0.7 = 0.14\\n$$\\n\\nFinally, compute $ \\\\lfloor 100p \\\\rfloor = \\\\lfloor 100 \\\\cdot 0.14 \\\\rfloor = \\\\lfloor 14 \\\\rfloor = 14 $.\", \"answer\": \"14\"}",
