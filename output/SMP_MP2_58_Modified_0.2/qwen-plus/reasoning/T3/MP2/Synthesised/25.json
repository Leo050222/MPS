  "math_problem": "Trevor and Edward play a game in which they take turns adding or removing beans from a pile. On each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. The player who empties the pile wins. For example, if Trevor goes first with a pile of 5 beans, he can either add 4 to make the total 9, or remove 4 to make the total 1, and either way Edward wins by removing all the beans. There is no limit to how large the pile can grow; it just starts with some finite number of beans in it, say fewer than 1000. Before the game begins, Edward dispatches a spy to find out how many beans will be in the opening pile, call this $n$, then \"graciously\" offers to let Trevor go first. Knowing that the first player is more likely to win, but not knowing $n$, Trevor logically but unwisely accepts, and Edward goes on to win the game. Find a number $n$ less than 1000 that would prompt this scenario, assuming both players are perfect logicians. A correct answer is worth the nearest integer to $\\log _{2}(n-4)$ points. Instead of finding an initial pile size $n$ less than 1000 that is a losing position for the first player under perfect play, simply find $k = s(p) - 6$, where $p$ is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example, and $s(p)$ is the largest perfect square at most $p$. In how many distinct ways can you color each of the vertices of a tetrahedron using $k$ colors such that no face has all three vertices the same color? (Two colorings are considered the same if one coloring can be rotated in three dimensions to obtain the other.)",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding the number of distinct colorings of a tetrahedron's vertices with $ k $ colors, where $ k = s(p) - 6 $. First, identify $ p $ from the example: starting with 5 beans, adding the largest perfect square (4) gives $ p = 9 $. The largest perfect square at most $ p $ is $ s(p) = 9 $, so $ k = 9 - 6 = 3 $. \\n\\nNext, count valid colorings of a tetrahedron with 3 colors, no face monochromatic, up to rotation. Using Burnside's lemma:\\n- **Identity element**: 54 valid colorings (total 81 minus 27 invalid).\\n- **8 rotations (120°/240°)**: 0 fixed valid colorings (each forces a monochromatic face).\\n- **3 rotations (180°)**: 6 fixed valid colorings each (2-2 color splits with distinct colors).\\n\\nTotal fixed colorings: $ 54 + 0 + 18 = 72 $. Divide by group size (12): $ 72 / 12 = 6 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
