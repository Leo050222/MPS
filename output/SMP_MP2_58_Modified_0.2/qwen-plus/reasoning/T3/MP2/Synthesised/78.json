  "math_problem": "Let $Q(x)=x^{2}+2x+3$, and suppose that $P(x)$ is a polynomial such that $P(Q(x))=x^{6}+6x^{5}+18x^{4}+32x^{3}+35x^{2}+22x+8$. Compute $P(2)$. Instead of computing $P(2)$, simply find $k = Q(r) - 1$, where $r$ is the unique real root of the derivative of $Q$.

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find the derivative of $ Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3 $, which is $ Q'(x) = 2x + 2 $. The unique real root of $ Q'(x) $ is $ r = -1 $. Compute $ Q(r) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 3 = 2 $. Thus, $ k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, determine if there exists an irrational $ \\\\alpha > k = 1 $ such that $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $ for all integers $ n \\\\geq k $ (i.e., $ n \\\\geq 1 $). For $ n = 1 $, $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha \\\\rfloor $ must be divisible by 2017, so $ \\\\alpha \\\\in [2017, 2018) $. For $ n = 2 $, $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^2 \\\\rfloor $ must also be divisible by 2017. However, as $ n $ increases, $ \\\\alpha^n $ grows exponentially, and the fractional parts of $ \\\\alpha^n $ modulo 2017 become dense due to equidistribution theorems for irrational $ \\\\alpha $. This implies that $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\mod 2017 $ cannot consistently be 0 for all $ n \\\\geq 1 $. The only $ \\\\alpha $ satisfying the condition for all $ n $ is $ \\\\alpha = 2017 $, which is rational. Hence, no such irrational $ \\\\alpha $ exists.\",\n    \"answer\": \"No\"\n}",
