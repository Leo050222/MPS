      "A1269": "Teresa the bunny has a fair 8-sided die. Seven of its sides have fixed labels $1,2, \\ldots, 7$, and the label on the eighth side can be changed and begins as 1. She rolls it several times, until each of $1,2, \\ldots, 7$ appears at least once. After each roll, if $k$ is the smallest positive integer that she has not rolled so far, she relabels the eighth side with $k$. The probability that 7 is the last number she rolls is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the specified linear combination from the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process, simply find $m = q_0 + 3999/4$, where $q_0$ is the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process derived from the recursive probability analysis of the states based on the number of distinct fixed labels collected."
