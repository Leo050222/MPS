First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill 11. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The system of equations is solved by expressing y and z in terms of x. From the third equation, y + z = 19 - x. Substituting into the first two equations and simplifying leads to a quadratic equation in x: x² - 18x + 72 = 0, with roots x = 12 and x = 6. For x = 12, the solution is (12, 3, 4); for x = 6, the solution is (6, 27/5, 38/5). The smaller root for x + 1 is 7 (from x = 6), so z = 38/5. Thus, k = z + 17/5 = 38/5 + 17/5 = 55/5 = 11.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using linearity of expectation, the expected number of games Alice plays is the sum over all other players of the probability she plays against them. For players with skill < 11 (L) and > 11 (H), the probability of playing against Alice is 2/(12 - p) for p in L and 2/(p - 10) for p in H. Summing these gives 4 times the harmonic sum from 2 to 11, resulting in 55991/6930.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"55991/6930\"\n}",
