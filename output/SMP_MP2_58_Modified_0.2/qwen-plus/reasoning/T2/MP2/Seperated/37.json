Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of determining the encoded numerical representation of the pentagon's area in radical form, simply find $k = CE - 8$, where $CE$ is the common length of the specified equal chords derived from the given segment lengths along the intersecting lines."

Using intersecting chords theorem and segment lengths AX=6, XY=4, YE=7. Let CE = L. From BD and CE intersection: BY * YD = CY * YE. Let BY = s, then YD = L - s - 7 (since CY = L - 7). BD = L = BY + XY + YD = s + 4 + (L - s - 7) ⇒ consistent. From intersecting chords at Y: s(L - s - 3) = 7(L - 7). Solving gives L = s + 7. Substituting into AC = BD = L and using intersecting chords at X: 6(L - 6) = (s + 4)(L - s - 4). With L = s + 7, solving yields s = 2, L = 9. Thus, CE = 9, so k = CE - 8 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Unit square ABCD with A(0,0), B(1,0), C(1,1), D(0,1). Circle tangent to AB (y=0) at E(h,0) has center (h, r) where r = 32/49. Distance from center to D(0,1) equals radius: √(h² + (r - 1)²) = r ⇒ h² = 2r - 1 = 15/49. DE = √(h² + 1) = √(64/49) = 8/7. Thus, m=8, n=7, 100m + n = 807.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"807\"\n}",
