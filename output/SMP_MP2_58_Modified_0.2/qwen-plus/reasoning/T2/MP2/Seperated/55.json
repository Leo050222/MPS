      "A3322": "A rubber band is 4 inches long. An ant begins at the left end. Every minute, the ant walks one inch along rightwards along the rubber band, but then the band is stretched (uniformly) by one inch. For what value of $n$ will the ant reach the right end during the $n$th minute? Instead of determining the minute during which the ant reaches the right end, simply find $e = p + \\frac{23}{4}$, where $p$ is the portion of the rubber band's length traversed by the ant during the first minute accounting for the uniform stretch."

Thus, e = p + 23/4 = 1/4 + 23/4 = 24/4 = 6.\\n\\nProblem 2: The valid permutations where no student has to pass another are those where each student finishes from the remaining leftmost or rightmost seat. For 6 students, there are 2^(6-1) = 32 such permutations. Total permutations are 6! = 720. The probability that some student has to pass is 1 - 32/720 = 1 - 2/45 = 43/45.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"43/45\"\n}",
