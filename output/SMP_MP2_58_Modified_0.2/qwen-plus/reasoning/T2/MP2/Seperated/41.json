Thus, the expression simplifies to $n + \\\\frac{-7n + 3}{n^2 + 7}$. For this to be an integer, $\\\\frac{-7n + 3}{n^2 + 7}$ must be an integer. Testing small $n$ values (since $n^2 + 7 \\\\leq 49 + 3n$ implies $n \\\\leq 8$), valid $n$ are 2 and 5. For $n=2$, the expression equals 1; for $n=5$, it equals 4. The problem states $n = \\\\text{expression value} + k$, so $k = n - \\\\text{expression value}$. Both cases give $k = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let roots be $\\\\alpha, \\\\beta$. By Vieta's formulas: $\\\\alpha + \\\\beta = \\\\frac{m}{2}$, $\\\\alpha\\\\beta = -4$. The difference condition $|\\\\alpha - \\\\beta| = m - 1$ leads to $(\\\\alpha - \\\\beta)^2 = (m - 1)^2$. Using $(\\\\alpha - \\\\beta)^2 = (\\\\alpha + \\\\beta)^2 - 4\\\\alpha\\\\beta$, we get $\\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16 = (m - 1)^2$. Solving $3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0$ yields $m = 6$ and $m = -\\\\frac{10}{3}$. Since $|\\\\alpha - \\\\beta| \\\\geq 0$, $m - 1 \\\\geq 0$ requires $m \\\\geq 1$, so only $m = 6$ is valid.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
