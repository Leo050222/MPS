  "math_problem": "Teresa the bunny has a fair 8-sided die. Seven of its sides have fixed labels $1,2, \\\\ldots, 7$, and the label on the eighth side can be changed and begins as 1. She rolls it several times, until each of $1,2, \\\\ldots, 7$ appears at least once. After each roll, if $k$ is the smallest positive integer that she has not rolled so far, she relabels the eighth side with $k$. The probability that 7 is the last number she rolls is $\\\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the specified linear combination from the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process, simply find $m = q_0 + 3999/4$, where $q_0$ is the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process derived from the recursive probability analysis of the states based on the number of distinct fixed labels collected. Let $N$ be the number of triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ satisfying $a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c, \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b, c)=1, \\\\quad a b c=6^{2020}$. Compute the remainder when $N$ is divided by $m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main parts: determining the probability $ q_0 $ that 7 is the last new label collected by Teresa the bunny, and computing the number $ N $ of triples $(a, b, c)$ satisfying specific conditions, then finding $ N \\\\mod m $ where $ m = q_0 + \\\\frac{3999}{4} $.\\n\\n**Step 1: Compute $ q_0 $**\\n\\nTeresa's process involves collecting labels $1, 2, \\\\ldots, 7$ with a dynamic 8-sided die. The key insight is that the probability $ q_0 $ that 7 is the last new label corresponds to the probability that all labels $1, \\\\ldots, 6$ are collected before 7. Using recursive analysis based on the number of missing labels in $\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, 6\\\\}$, we derive the recurrence:\\n\\n$$\\np_t = \\\\frac{t + 1}{t + 2} p_{t-1}\\n$$\\n\\nwith base case $ p_0 = 1 $. Solving this for $ t = 6 $ (initial state with all 6 labels missing):\\n\\n$$\\np_6 = \\\\frac{7}{8} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{6}{7} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{5}{6} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{4}{5} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cdot 1 = \\\\frac{1}{4}\\n$$\\n\\nThus, $ q_0 = \\\\frac{1}{4} $.\\n\\n**Step 2: Compute $ m $**\\n\\nGiven $ m = q_0 + \\\\frac{3999}{4} $:\\n\\n$$\\nm = \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{3999}{4} = \\\\frac{4000}{4} = 1000\\n$$\\n\\n**Step 3: Compute $ N $**\\n\\nWe need the number of triples $(a, b, c)$ with $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c $, $ \\\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1 $, and $ abc = 6^{2020} $. Factorizing $ 6^{2020} = 2^{2020} \\\\cdot 3^{2020} $, the condition $ \\\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1 $ implies that not all $ a, b, c $ are divisible by 2 or 3. Using inclusion-exclusion:\\n\\n- Total number of triples with $ abc = 6^{2020} $: $ U_{\\\\text{total}} $\\n- Subtract triples where all are divisible by 2 ($ U_A $) and by 3 ($ U_B $)\\n- Add back triples where all are divisible by both 2 and 3 ($ U_{AB} $)\\n\\nUsing Burnside's lemma and properties of exponent triples, we find:\\n\\n$$\\nN = \\\\frac{(C(2022, 2) - C(2019, 2))^2 + 3 \\\\cdot (1011 - 1009)^2}{6}\\n$$\\n\\nCalculating:\\n- $ C(n, 2) = \\\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} $\\n- $ C(2022, 2) - C(2019, 2) = 6060 $\\n- $ (6060)^2 + 12 = 36723600 + 12 = 36723612 $\\n- $ N = \\\\frac{36723612}{6} = 6120602 $\\n\\n**Step 4: Compute $ N \\\\mod m $**\\n\\nSince $ m = 1000 $, the remainder when $ 6120602 $ is divided by $ 1000 $ is the last three digits:\\n\\n$$\\n6120602 \\\\mod 1000 = 602\\n$$\",\n    \"answer\": \"602\"\n}",
