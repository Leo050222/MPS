  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Instead of determining the number of partitions of the set into pairs that form a single cell, simply find $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game. What is the probability that exactly $k$ games will need to be played to determine a winner?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two parts. First, determining $ k = n + 5 $ where $ n $ is the cardinality of set $ A $ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A consistent 2-configuration forming a single pair implies $ A $ must have exactly 2 elements (since a single pair partitions $ A $), so $ n = 2 $ and $ k = 2 + 5 = 7 $. \\n\\nNext, for a best-of-9 series (first to 5 wins), the probability that exactly $ k = 7 $ games are played requires one team to win the 7th game after having exactly 4 wins in the first 6 games. For the Mathletes (win probability $ \\\\frac{2}{3} $), the probability is $ \\\\binom{6}{4} \\\\left( \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\right)^5 \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\right)^2 $.
