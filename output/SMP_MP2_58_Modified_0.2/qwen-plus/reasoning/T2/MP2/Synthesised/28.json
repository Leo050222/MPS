There are 21 competitors with distinct skill levels numbered $1,2, \\ldots, 21$. They participate in a pingpong tournament as follows. First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill $k$. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?",

Substitute into the first two equations.\\n\\nFrom the first equation:\\n$$\\nz = 40 - xy\\n$$\\nSubstitute into the third equation:\\n$$\\nx + y + (40 - xy) = 19 \\\\Rightarrow x + y - xy = -21 \\\\Rightarrow (x - 1)(y - 1) = 22\\n$$\\n\\nFrom the second equation:\\n$$\\ny = 51 - xz = 51 - x(40 - xy) = 51 - 40x + x^2y\\n\\\\Rightarrow y(1 - x^2) = 51 - 40x \\\\Rightarrow y = \\\\frac{40x - 51}{x^2 - 1}\\n$$\\n\\nNow equate this with the earlier expression for $ y $ from the factorization:\\n$$\\ny = \\\\frac{x + 21}{x - 1}\\n$$\\n\\nSet both expressions equal:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{x + 21}{x - 1} = \\\\frac{40x - 51}{x^2 - 1}\\n$$\\nMultiply both sides by $ x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1) $:\\n$$\\n(x + 21)(x + 1) = 40x - 51\\n\\\\Rightarrow x^2 + 22x + 21 = 40x - 51\\n\\\\Rightarrow x^2 - 18x + 72 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nSolve the quadratic:\\n$$\\nx = \\\\frac{18 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{324 - 288}}{2} = \\\\frac{18 \\\\pm 6}{2} = 6, 12\\n$$\\n\\nFor each value of $ x $, compute $ y $ and $ z $ using the original equations.\\n\\n- **Case 1: $ x = 6 $**\\n  $$\\ny = \\\\frac{6 + 21}{6 - 1} = \\\\frac{27}{5}, \\\\quad z = 19 - 6 - \\\\frac{27}{5} = \\\\frac{38}{5}\\n  $$\\n\\n- **Case 2: $ x = 12 $**\\n  $$\\ny = \\\\frac{12 + 21}{12 - 1} = 3, \\\\quad z = 19 - 12 - 3 = 4\\n  $$\\n\\nSo the solutions are:\\n$$\\n(6, \\\\tfrac{27}{5}, \\\\tfrac{38}{5}) \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad (12, 3, 4)\\n$$\\n\\nWe are told to find $ k = z + \\\\frac{17}{5} $, where $ z $ corresponds to the **smaller root for $ x + 1 $**.\\n\\n- For $ x = 6 $, $ x + 1 = 7 $\\n- For $ x = 12 $, $ x + 1 = 13 $\\n\\nThus, the smaller root is $ x = 6 $, so $ z = \\\\frac{38}{5} $\\n\\nThen:\\n$$\\nk = \\\\frac{38}{5} + \\\\frac{17}{5} = \\\\frac{55}{5} = 11\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Determine Expected Number of Games Alice Plays\\n\\nAlice has skill level $ k = 11 $ in a tournament with 21 players numbered $ 1 $ through $ 21 $, where higher skill always wins.\\n\\nLet:\\n- $ L = 10 $: number of players with skill less than Alice (skills 1–10)\\n- $ H = 10 $: number of players with skill greater than Alice (skills 12–21)\\n\\nThe expected number of games Alice plays is given by the formula derived from probabilistic analysis of such tournaments:\\n\\n$$\\nE = 1 + \\\\frac{L}{H + 2}\\n$$\\n\\nThis accounts for:\\n- The guaranteed game Alice plays when she loses to a higher-skilled player\\n- The expected number of lower-skilled players she defeats before encountering a higher-skilled one\\n\\nPlug in values:\\n$$\\nE = 1 + \\\\frac{10}{10 + 2} = 1 + \\\\frac{10}{12} = \\\\frac{11}{6}\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"11/6\"}",
