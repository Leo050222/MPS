  "math_problem": "$A B C D E$ is a cyclic convex pentagon, and $A C=B D=C E . A C$ and $B D$ intersect at $X$, and $B D$ and $C E$ intersect at $Y$. If $A X=6, X Y=4$, and $Y E=7$, then the area of pentagon $A B C D E$ can be written as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are integers, $c$ is positive, $b$ is square-free, and $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$. Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of determining the encoded numerical representation of the pentagon's area in radical form, simply find $k = CE - 8$, where $CE$ is the common length of the specified equal chords derived from the given segment lengths along the intersecting lines. Let $A B C D$ be a unit square. A circle with radius $\\frac{32}{49}$ passes through point $D$ and is tangent to side $A B$ at point $E$. Then $D E=\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=k$. Find $100 m+n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two parts. First, we need to find $ k = CE - 8 $ from the cyclic pentagon, then use $ k $ as the gcd for the unit square problem.\\n\\n**Part 1: Cyclic Pentagon**\\n\\nGiven a cyclic convex pentagon $ ABCDE $ with $ AC = BD = CE $, and intersections $ X $ (of $ AC $ and $ BD $) and $ Y $ (of $ BD $ and $ CE $). Given $ AX = 6 $, $ XY = 4 $, $ YE = 7 $.\\n\\n- Let $ CE = t $. Then $ CY = t - 7 $.\\n- Using power of a point at $ Y $: $ BY \\\\cdot YD = CY \\\\cdot YE $.\\n- Let $ YD = d $, so $ BY = t - d $. Then $ (t - d)d = 7(t - 7) $.\\n- Using power of a point at $ X $: $ AX \\\\cdot XC = BX \\\\cdot XD $. Let $ XD = 6 $ (from cyclic quadrilateral properties and arc equalities), so $ XC = t - 6 $, $ BX = t - 6 $.\\n- Given $ XY = 4 $, if $ Y $ is between $ X $ and $ D $, then $ YD = XD - XY = 6 - 4 = 2 $. Substituting $ d = 2 $ into $ (t - 2) \\\\cdot 2 = 7(t - 7) $:\\n  $$\\n  2t - 4 = 7t - 49 \\\\implies 5t = 45 \\\\implies t = 9.\\n  $$\\n- Thus, $ CE = 9 $, so $ k = CE - 8 = 1 $.\\n\\n**Part 2: Unit Square and Circle**\\n\\nLet $ ABCD $ be a unit square with $ A(0,0) $, $ B(1,0) $, $ C(1,1) $, $ D(0,1) $. A circle with radius $ \\\\frac{32}{49} $ is tangent to $ AB $ at $ E(e, 0) $ and passes through $ D(0,1) $.\\n\\n- Center of the circle is $ (e, r) $ where $ r = \\\\frac{32}{49} $.\\n- Distance from center to $ D $: $ \\\\sqrt{e^2 + (r - 1)^2} = r $.\\n- Solving: $ e^2 = 2r - 1 = \\\\frac{64}{49} - \\\\frac{49}{49} = \\\\frac{15}{49} \\\\implies e = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{15}}{7} $.\\n- Distance $ DE = \\\\sqrt{e^2 + 1^2} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{15}{49} + 1} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{64}{49}} = \\\\frac{8}{7} $.\\n- Here, $ m = 8 $, $ n = 7 $, and $ \\\\gcd(8, 7) = 1 = k $ (from Part 1).\\n- Thus, $ 100m + n = 100 \\\\cdot 8 + 7 = 807 $.\", \"answer\": \"807\"}",
