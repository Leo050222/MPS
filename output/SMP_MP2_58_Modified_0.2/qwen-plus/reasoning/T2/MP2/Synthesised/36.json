  "math_problem": "Eight points are chosen on the circumference of a circle, labelled $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{8}$ in clockwise order. A route is a sequence of at least two points $P_{a_{1}}, P_{a_{2}}, \\ldots, P_{a_{n}}$ such that if an ant were to visit these points in their given order, starting at $P_{a_{1}}$ and ending at $P_{a_{n}}$, by following $n-1$ straight line segments (each connecting each $P_{a_{i}}$ and $P_{a_{i+1}}$ ), it would never visit a point twice or cross its own path. Find the number of routes. Instead of determining the total number of such routes, simply find $k = r - 1092$, where $r$ is the number of valid routes starting from the designated point $P_8$. Let $A B C D E F G H$ be an equilateral octagon with $\\angle A \\cong \\angle C \\cong \\angle E \\cong \\angle G$ and $\\angle B \\cong \\angle D \\cong \\angle F \\cong \\angle H$. If the area of $A B C D E F G H$ is three times the area of $A C E G$, then $\\sin B$ can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\gcd(m, n)=k$. Find $100 m+n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the route problem: Eight points on a circle, routes starting at P8 must be non-crossing and visit distinct points. For a convex n-gon, the number of non-crossing routes starting at a fixed vertex is (3^(n-1) - 1)/2. Here n=8, so r = (3^7 - 1)/2 = 1093. Thus, k = r - 1092 = 1.\\n\\nNext, the octagon problem: Equilateral octagon with alternating angles α and β. Sum of interior angles gives α + β = 270°. Using coordinate geometry and shoelace formula, area of octagon is 2s²(1 + sin β - cos β), area of ACEG is 2s²(1 - cos β). Given octagon area is 3×ACEG area, solve 1 + sin β - cos β = 3(1 - cos β) → sin β + 2 cos β = 2. Solving yields sin β = 4/5 (valid solution). gcd(4,5)=1=k. Thus, 100m + n = 100×4 + 5 = 405.\",\n    \"answer\": \"405\"\n}",
