  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Exploring polynomial roots**\n\nI’m starting with roots x1 and x2 from the polynomial x² + x - A = 0 and noting that f(x1) equals f(x2). This means (x - x1)(x - x2) divides the expression. The elementary symmetric sums here are s1 = x1 + x2 = -1 and s2 = x1 x2 = -A. The discriminant Δ = 1 + 4A tells us they are distinct if A is not equal to -1/4. Let’s compute f(x) using power sums for further analysis.**Computing polynomial differences**\n\nWhen considering f(x1) - f(x2), I find that it equals (x1 - x2) times a specific expression involving the sums of powers of x. The identity I’m recalling for the difference of x⁴ helps frame my thinking: x1⁴ - x2⁴ equals (x1 - x2) times a cubic term. So, the overall expression simplifies to show the importance of H, which needs to equal zero for distinct roots. I'll compute H using the symmetric sums s1 and s2 next, starting with T1.**Utilizing identities in computation**\n\nI'm looking at Newton's identities for help. First, I can express x1³ + x2³ in terms of s1 and s2, leading to T1, which simplifies to s1³ - 2s2s1. For the quadratic sum, x1² + x1x2 + x2², I find that it equals s1² - s2. Bringing it all together, H is computed as a function of s1 and s2. Given that s1 is -1 and s2 is -A, I can plug in those values. This gives me T1's contribution as -1 - 2A.**Finalizing calculations for A**\n\nI calculated 3(s1² - s2) and found it equals 3(1 + A), leading to H = A + 7 after summing. Setting H to zero gives me A = -7. This is great because it meets the requirement for distinct roots, as the discriminant Δ = 1 - 28 = -27 is non-zero, confirming I have distinct complex numbers. Finally, I should check if the quadratic x² + x + 7 = 0 has valid solutions.**Summarizing findings and calculations**\n\nFirst, setting A = -7 confirmed that the roots of the quadratic are complex and distinct. The derived equation supports this, and there's no other possibility for A without degeneracy issues. Now, I'm moving to Problem 2, where I need to evaluate a sum. I've factored the denominator and set up a partial fraction decomposition. After defining coefficients through substitutions, I've calculated each constant. \n\nThe resulting formula lets me telescopically evaluate the sum. Finally, I verified my fractions and calculations, yielding the final sum of 592/969, which is reduced. That's solid! Now, I need to format this for the JSON output.</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let p(x)=x^2+x−A. The first two equations imply x1 and x2 are (distinct) roots of p, so x1+x2=−1 and x1x2=−A, with distinctness requiring 1+4A≠0. Let f(x)=x^4+3x^3+5x. Then f(x1)−f(x2)=(x1−x2)H, where H=(x1^3+x1^2x2+x1x2^2+x2^3)+3(x1^2+x1x2+x2^2)+5. Using s1=x1+x2=−1 and s2=x1x2=−A, we get x1^3+x2^3=s1^3−3s1s2, and x1^2x2+x1x2^2=s1s2, and x1^2+x1x2+x2^2=s1^2−s2. Hence H=(s1^3−2s1s2)+3(s1^2−s2)+5=(−1−2A)+3(1+A)+5=A+7. Since x1≠x2, H=0 ⇒ A=−7, and 1+4A=−27≠0, so valid. Problem 2: Factor the denominator n^4+2n^3−n^2−2n = n(n−1)(n+1)(n+2). Partial fractions give (n^2+n+1)/[n(n−1)(n+1)(n+2)] = 1/2[1/(n−1) − 1/n + 1/(n+1) − 1/(n+2)]. Summing from n=2 to 17 telescopes: sum[1/(n−1)−1/n] = 1−1/17 = 16/17, and sum[1/(n+1)−1/(n+2)] = 1/3 − 1/19. Thus the total is (1/2)[16/17 + 1/3 − 1/19] = (1/2)(1184/969) = 592/969.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"-7\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"592/969\"\n}",
