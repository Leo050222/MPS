  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Evaluating prime conditions**\n\nTo express this as p/q with p and q being primes, I need (r+5)/d and (r+1)/d to be primes too. Since primes can't be 1, both must be primes. Specifically, I can look at cases for d = 1, 2, and 4. If d = 1, then r, an odd prime, has only one possible case: r = 2, giving p = 7 and q = 3. This works since p/q indicates a valid solution!**Analyzing case d=2**\n\nIn the case where d = 2, r + 1 must be even, which works for odd primes. But if r = 2, then r + 1 = 3, which is not suitable because gcd(4, 3) = 1. We need gcd(4, r + 1) = 2, meaning r + 1 is even but not divisible by 4, so r must satisfy r ≡ 1 mod 4. For these r values, both (r + 1)/2 and (r + 5)/2 need to be prime. Interestingly, they would be twin primes!**Exploring small primes**\n\nLet’s look at small prime values for r that satisfy r ≡ 1 mod 4: like 5, 13, 17, 29, 37, 41, and 53. Starting with r = 5, I find (r + 1)/2 = 3 and (r + 5)/2 = 5, both of which are primes. This gives me p = 5 and q = 3. The calculation holds true, so (5,3,5) works. However, when testing larger values like r = 13 and 17, they both fail to yield prime results. It seems only r = 5 holds!**Considering additional constraints**\n\nIt seems that r must satisfy r ≡ 1 mod 4, which leads to r + 5 ≡ 2 mod 4, making (r + 5)/2 odd. I’m testing larger primes like r = 61, 89, and 97, but their results have been mostly composite. I'm also checking mod 3 constraints: for (r + 5)/2 to be prime, if r ≡ 1 mod 6, many will be divisible by 3, leading to composites unless r equals 3. Unfortunately, that isn't prime either. So far, r = 5 still seems to be the only good case! But I'm also considering d = 4.**Analyzing case d=4 and primes**\n\nIn the case where d = 4, I need r to satisfy r ≡ 3 mod 4, which requires (r + 1)/4 and (r + 5)/4 to be primes. However, the only valid consecutive primes that differ by 1 are 2 and 3. This leads me to r = 7 as a potential solution. I’ve checked other values and found potential pairs but confirmed that they all lead to composites. \n\nThe valid solutions I’ve identified so far include (7, 3, 2), (5, 3, 5), and (3, 2, 7). I’m exploring the possibility of additional valid r values. In twin primes, only a = 3 seems to consistently provide a prime r.**Concluding the prime problem and starting random walk analysis**\n\nIt seems only r=5 works with twin primes, particularly since it fits the 6k scenarios, and we've rigorously checked other cases. Thus, the only satisfying solutions for all cases are: (7, 3, 2), (5, 3, 5), and (3, 2, 7). \n\nNow, moving on to the random walk on a toroidal 8x8 grid, I need to assess how movement diagonally impacts the probability of returning to the origin after 2012 steps. Each step presents independent outcomes, making it a straightforward random walk analysis.**Analyzing return probabilities**\n\nI'm determining the probability of returning to the origin after a specified number of steps on a toroidal grid. The calculation hinges on step parity, which must be even, confirming n=2012 works for this scenario. \n\nUsing the characteristic function approach for a cyclic random walk modulo 8, I can compute the chances for both x and y coordinates to align back at zero. The probabilities combine multiplicatively, resulting in a straightforward expression that incorporates cosine terms, producing various components ultimately simplifying down to a manageable fractional result.**Calculating probability expression**\n\nI'm determining the exact probability expression as a sum of powers of 2. I find that it can be represented rationally, specifically as (2^2010 + 2^1006 + 1)/2^2014. While 1/16 + 2^-1008 + 2^-2014 is accurate, it appears better to offer a single fraction. I need to ensure the JSON format is valid and includes step-by-step reasoning for both problems followed by their respective answers, focusing on the necessary calculations without extra text. Let’s finalize this!**Crafting reasoning**\n\nI’m putting together the reasoning for two problems. For Problem 1, I need to rearrange and analyze the gcd: for d=1, r=2 gives (7,3,2); d=2 leads to twin primes showing only possible when a=3. For Problem 2, I’ll focus on the independence of coordinates and calculate the return probability using a 1D modulo-8 formula for n=2012. I should keep the reasoning string concise, possibly using short lines separated by semicolons for clarity, then format this into JSON.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Rearrange to p/q = (r+5)/(r+1). Let d = gcd(r+5, r+1) = gcd(4, r+1) ∈ {1,2,4}. Then p = (r+5)/d and q = (r+1)/d must both be primes. d=1 ⇒ r+1 and r+5 both prime; only r=2 works, giving (p,q,r)=(7,3,2). d=2 ⇒ ((r+1)/2, (r+5)/2) are twin primes; for twin primes a,a+2 with a>3, a≡5 (mod 6) ⇒ r=2a−1 divisible by 3, so the only possibility is a=3 ⇒ r=5, giving (5,3,5). d=4 ⇒ ((r+1)/4, (r+5)/4) are consecutive primes ⇒ (2,3) ⇒ r=7, giving (3,2,7). Hence the only solutions are (7,3,2), (5,3,5), (3,2,7). Problem 2: The diagonal step splits into independent 1D steps mod 8 for x and y. For one coordinate, P(S_n ≡ 0 mod 8) = (1/8)∑_{j=0}^7 cos^n(π j/4) = (1/4) + (1/2)(√2/2)^n. With n=2012, this is 1/4 + 2^{-1007}. Independence gives total return probability [1/4 + 2^{-1007}]^2 = 1/16 + 2^{-1008} + 2^{-2014}.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"(7,3,2), (5,3,5), (3,2,7)\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1/16+2^-1008+2^-2014\"\n}",
