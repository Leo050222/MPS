  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Solving polynomial and square conditions**\n\nI’m tackling a compound problem: finding a 4-digit square number (1000-9999) with all digits less than 6. If I add 1 to each digit, the result is also a square. Then, I need to determine m = a - 42, where a is the integer whose square is n. I have a remainder problem involving a polynomial P(x) with specific remainders, and I notice the divisor's structure is unusual, suggesting some connections to cubic factors. I’m considering if m could be 3.**Determining polynomial divisor and squares**\n\nIf m equals 3, the divisor becomes x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6, which factors into (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) — this matches the given remainders at 1, 2, and 3, so it seems likely that m is indeed 3. Next, I need to find a 4-digit square number n with digits 0-5. When I add 1 to each digit, it should still be a 4-digit square. I'll reason through possible values logically without using a computer, focusing on squares from 32^2 to 99^2.**Analyzing digit carry and differences**\n\nOkay, if any digit were 9, adding 1 would cause a carry. But since my digits are limited to 0-5, adding 1 to each digit won't cause any carry, meaning T equals S plus 1111. I need two 4-digit square numbers that differ by 1111. This leads me to find integers a and b such that b^2 - a^2 equals 1111. I'll work through the difference equation next.\n\nSo, we have b^2 - a^2, which factors to (b-a)(b+a) = 1111. I noticed that 1111 can be factored into pairs involving distinct primes, 11 and 101. I'll ensure a and b are positive integers within the range of 4-digit squares. Let’s define d as (b-a) and s as (b+a).**Finding valid square pairs**\n\nNow, I’ve established that d * s = 1111, and both d and s are positive odd integers. The valid pairs to consider are (1, 1111) and (11, 101). I should choose pairs where d is less than or equal to s. \n\nIn Case 1 with d=1 and s=1111, I calculate a and b but find a is too large to be a 4-digit square. In Case 2 with d=11 and s=101, I find a=45 and b=56, both within the range. Their squares, 2025 and 3136, have valid digits too. So S=2025 works, but T contains a digit above 6, which the problem doesn't limit.**Calculating the remainder polynomial**\n\nFirst, I determined that the difference of squares gives us 1111, leading to integers a and b. I found a=45, which gives m=3. The polynomial P has specific remainders at x=1,2,3, which allows me to use the Lagrange interpolation method to find the remainder when dividing by the cubic polynomial x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6. This polynomial factors into (x-1)(x-2)(x-3). \n\nNext, I calculated R(x) such that R(1)=-4, R(2)=-1, and R(3)=4. Through interpolation, I derived that the remainder polynomial is x^2 - 5. \n\nNow, I will present my final answer in JSON format, following the required structure.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"We find 4-digit squares' difference 1111, leading to a=45 and m=3. Using Lagrange interpolation, we calculate the remainder polynomial from given values.\",\n  \"answer\": \"x^2 - 5\"\n}\n```</think>\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"1) Let n be a 4-digit square with digits <=5, and adding 1 to each digit gives another square. Adding 1 to each digit (no carries) means the two squares differ by 1111. Write b^2 - a^2 = 1111 = (b-a)(b+a). The factor pairs (d,s) = (b-a, b+a) for 1111 are (1,1111) and (11,101). The only pair giving 4-digit squares is (11,101), yielding a=(101-11)/2=45 and b=56. So n=a^2=2025, and m=a-42=45-42=3. 2) The divisor becomes x^m - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3). The remainder upon division by this cubic is the unique quadratic R with R(1)=-4, R(2)=-1, R(3)=4. Lagrange interpolation gives R(x) = -4*(x-2)(x-3)/2 -1*(-(x-1)(x-3)) + 4*(x-1)(x-2)/2 = x^2 - 5.\",  \n    \"answer\": \"x^2-5\"\n}",
