Instead of determining the circumradius of the sphere containing all four vertices, simply find $\\delta = AX - \\frac{7}{10}$, where $AX$ is the altitude from vertex $A$ to the plane of face $BCD$. In the Cartesian plane, let $A=(0,0)$, $B=(200,100)$, and $C=(30,330)$. Compute the number of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of integers so that $\\left(x+\\delta, y+\\delta\\right)$ is in the interior of triangle $A B C$.",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Clarifying math response structure**\n\nI see that I need to answer a math problem with step-by-step reasoning first, followed by a JSON format. There's a requirement for the reasoning to precede the final answer in JSON. The initial statement allows reasoning in the JSON, so I'll keep that in mind. While the dev guidelines mention plain text, I'll include the detailed reasoning before presenting the JSON answer. I think this approach could work well!**Clarifying JSON response requirements**\n\nI see that I need to provide the final answer in JSON format as the last block. It’s fine for the reasoning to be plain text before the JSON. The instructions specify that I must clearly present the answer in the designated JSON structure, which means just the answer field should be included. I'll include the reasoning before transitioning to the final JSON output. Now, let’s solve the problem of finding delta = AX - 7/10, focusing on calculating AX using the volume formula.**Analyzing geometry for obstacle problem**\n\nI need to find AX, which relates to the volume given as V = 1. So, AX equals 3 divided by the area of triangle BCD. However, I don't have the area yet. I know that BC*CD*DB = 16 and all edges from A to B, C, and D are equal at 2. That suggests A is an apex above the face BCD. I might use Heron's formula for the area, but I only have the product of the sides. There’s a connection to the circumsphere I need to consider too.**Understanding circumradius and triangle area**\n\nThe circumradius R relates to the vertices AB, AC, and AD all being equal to 2 and equidistant from B, C, and D. However, the user wants me to find delta = AX - 7/10 instead of calculating the circumradius. To find AX, I need the area of triangle BCD, which I might infer from BC, CD, and DB. It's intriguing that even though A is equidistant from B, C, and D, that doesn’t guarantee triangle BCD has a circumradius of 2. I think the circumcenter lies directly beneath A on the plane of triangle BCD!**Verifying lattice point calculations**\n\nTo find the number of interior integer lattice points in triangle A'B'C', I need to calculate boundary points B using the GCD method. I determine B by summing GCDs of edge differences. For the triangle edges, I find the GCD values for segments AB', B'C', and C'A', which total to 280 boundary points. By applying Pick's theorem, I calculate the interior points as 125861. I’ll ensure I summarize the reasoning before outputting the final answer in JSON as \"125861\" without additional text.</think>\n\nUsing the tetrahedron facts:\n- A is equidistant from B, C, D with AB = AC = AD = 2, so the foot X of the altitude from A to plane BCD is the circumcenter of triangle BCD.\n- Let R be the circumradius of triangle BCD and K its area. Then 2^2 = AX^2 + R^2, and K = (BC·CD·DB)/(4R) = 16/(4R) = 4/R.\n- Volume V = (1/3)·K·AX = 1 gives (1/3)·(4/R)·AX = 1 ⇒ 4AX = 3R ⇒ R = (4/3)AX.\n- Substitute into 4 = AX^2 + R^2: 4 = AX^2 + (16/9)AX^2 = (25/9)AX^2 ⇒ AX = 6/5. Hence δ = AX − 7/10 = 6/5 − 7/10 = 1/2.\n\nCounting integer pairs (x,y) with (x+δ, y+δ) inside triangle ABC where A=(0,0), B=(200,100), C=(30,330) and δ=1/2:\n- Points (x+1/2, y+1/2) correspond bijectively to integer points inside the triangle with vertices A' = 2(A−(1/2,1/2)) = (−1,−1), B' = (399,199), C' = (59,659).\n- Area(ABC) = |det(AB,AC)|/2 = |200·330 − 100·30|/2 = 63000/2 = 31500. Thus Area(A'B'C') = 4·31500 = 126000.\n- Boundary lattice points B via gcd on edges:\n  - AB': gcd(400,200) = 200\n  - B'C': gcd(340,460) = 20\n  - C'A': gcd(60,660) = 60\n  - Total B = 280.\n- By Pick’s theorem, interior points I = Area − B/2 + 1 = 126000 − 140 + 1 = 125861.\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"125861\"\n}",
