  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Planning a complex problem**\n\nI'm diving into a multi-part problem that seems tricky! First, I need to find the smallest integer \\( n > 1 \\) so that the RMS of the first \\( n \\) positive integers is an integer. Instead of that, I'll focus on deriving \\( d = a - 14 \\).\n\nTo do this, I need to solve the Pell-type equation \\( 4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1 \\) to find the smallest \\( a > 1 \\). Next, I’ll assess the polynomial \\( P \\) with roots related to \\( z^5 + 2004z - 1 = 0 \\) to calculate \\( \\frac{P(d)}{P(-d)} \\). That's a lot to consider!**Analyzing polynomial properties**\n\nI need to examine the polynomial \\( P \\) connected to the roots of \\( z^5 + 2004z - 1 = 0 \\). The property states that if \\( z \\) is a root, then \\( P(z^2) = 0 \\). This means \\( P \\) has a degree of 5, with roots being \\( z_k^2 \\) for each of the five roots \\( z_k \\). \n\nIt's important to acknowledge that squaring might lead to duplicated roots, but generally, the squares will be distinct. I can express \\( P(x) \\) as a product of its roots, and then I plan to evaluate \\( P \\) at \\( \\pm d \\) to find the quotient that seems independent of scaling. I’ll calculate it as the product \\( \\frac{P(d)}{P(-d)} \\), letting me focus on how these roots interact!**Exploring polynomial relationships**\n\nI think I might explore relationships between the polynomials to find what I need. Perhaps I can use the reciprocal of the signs to derive some polynomial expression by substituting \\( \\pm d \\) for \\( x \\). \n\nThe challenge is that I don't have the coefficients for \\( P \\). However, I can express \\( P \\) in relation to the original quintic by transforming \\( x = z^2 \\). Since \\( z \\) satisfies \\( z^5 + 2004 z - 1 = 0 \\), I can eliminate \\( z \\) by finding the resultant of the polynomials \\( z^2 - x = 0 \\) and \\( z^5 + 2004 z - 1 = 0 \\). This should yield \\( P(x) \\) up to a constant!**Deriving polynomial expression**\n\nI can derive \\( z \\) by leveraging \\( z^2 = x \\). This leads me to express \\( z^5 \\) as \\( z \\cdot x^2 \\). So, rewriting gives \\( z \\cdot x^2 + 2004z - 1 = 0 \\), which simplifies to \\( z = \\frac{1}{x^2 + 2004} \\). \n\nThen, substituting this back into \\( z^2 = x \\) means \\( 1 = x (x^2 + 2004)^2 \\). This leads me to the polynomial \\( P(x) = x (x^2 + 2004)^2 - 1 \\), confirming that it's indeed a degree 5 polynomial and can be monic! Great, I can confidently say that \\( P(x) \\) matches what I need.**Calculating P(d) and P(-d)**\n\nI have \\( P(x) = x (x^2 + 2004)^2 - 1 \\), and I'm interested in \\( P(d) \\) and \\( P(-d) \\). The polynomial has odd terms and a constant of -1, so when I calculate \\( P(-x) \\), it takes the form \\( -[x (x^2 + 2004)^2 + 1] \\). \n\nNow, substituting \\( d \\) from my earlier results leads me to compute \\( P(1) \\) and \\( P(-1) \\). After figuring out \\( P(1) = 4,020,024 \\) and \\( P(-1) = -4,020,026 \\), I can establish the ratio \\( P(1)/P(-1) = -\\frac{2,010,012}{2,010,013} \\). \n\nTo align with the request for an exact value in simplified fraction form, I’ll express my final answer as \\( -\\frac{2005^2 - 1}{2005^2 + 1} \\).**Preparing the reasoning for JSON output**\n\nLet's start by calculating \\(2005^2 - 1\\), which gives us \\(2004 \\times 2006 = 4,020,024\\). The denominator is \\(4,020,026\\), leading to the simplified ratio of \\(-\\frac{2,010,012}{2,010,013}\\). To stick to the instructions, I'll follow the specified JSON format that includes reasoning leading to the answer.\n\nThe minimal \\(a\\) value greater than 1 is confirmed to be 15, resulting in \\(d = a - 14 = 1\\). With \\(P(x)\\) defined and evaluated at \\(±1\\), I’ll ensure to format my reasoning properly and compile my final answer accordingly in JSON.\n\nHere's the structured output as required:\n\n```json\n{ \"answer\": \"-2010012/2010013\" }\n```</think>\n\n- Solve 4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1 with a > 1, b > 0. Let u = 2b, v = a ⇒ u^2 - 3v^2 = 1. Fundamental solution is (2,1); to keep u even, use odd powers of (2 + sqrt(3)). Next is (u,v) = (26,15) ⇒ a = 15. Thus d = a - 14 = 1.\n- If z^5 + 2004z = 1 and x = z^2, then z x^2 + 2004z = 1 ⇒ z = 1/(x^2 + 2004) and z^2 = x ⇒ x(x^2 + 2004)^2 = 1. Hence P(x) = x(x^2 + 2004)^2 - 1 (monic, deg 5).\n- Evaluate: P(1) = 2005^2 - 1, P(-1) = -2005^2 - 1 ⇒ P(1)/P(-1) = -(2005^2 - 1)/(2005^2 + 1) = -2010012/2010013.\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"-2010012/2010013\"\n}",
