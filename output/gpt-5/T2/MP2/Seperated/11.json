  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing sequence structures**\n\nI’m noticing that there’s a mirror across the middle column, with specific exchanges like A<->C and D<->F, and others vertically. The automorphism group is D2 with 4 elements. I should compute the number of sequences, possibly by considering “forbidden” moves, like eating both centers last. Dynamic programming might help here, enumerating states of remaining subgraph isomorphism classes. Since nodes are distinct, I can compute recursively by counting sequences, defining edible nodes as those with a degree ≤ 2.**Evaluating edible nodes**\n\nI’m analyzing a graph where the maximum degree is 3, specifically at nodes B and E. A node becomes inedible only when it’s a center with all three neighbors. So, I can’t eat B or E until at least one neighbor is removed. Both B and E become edible once their degree drops to 2, which happens when one neighbor is taken out. For instance, if I remove A, B then loses a neighbor, reducing its degree from 3 to 2, making it edible.**Examining node eligibility**\n\nE still has neighbors D, F, and B, giving it a degree of 3, so it’s not edible yet. At each step, the allowed vertices are all except B and E when they have all three neighbors. Initially, only the corner nodes are allowed. As removals happen, B or E may eventually become eligible. It seems only B and E have a degree of 3 at first, with corners having ≤2. They depend on each other, so initially, both are blocked.**Analyzing sequence availability**\n\nAfter I remove one corner, B becomes available. However, for E to become unblocked, at least one of its neighbors—D, F, or B—needs to be removed. Until then, E stays blocked. Removing corners A or C doesn’t impact E’s status. So, E will remain blocked until we remove one of D, F, or B, but we can’t remove B initially. If I remove D or F first, that opens E. The allowed sequences will respect these constraints.**Counting valid sequences**\n\nI’m working through the constraints for sequence selection, focusing on edible pieces. For B to be chosen, at least one of {A, C, E} must be removed first. This is a disjunctive constraint, and I wonder if there could be steps where B becomes ineligible. Once B is eligible, it stays that way as long as its degree remains ≤2. So, the first step must ensure at least one of {A, C, E} precedes B. \n\nSimilarly, E needs one of {D, F, B} to be removed first. I’ll count all permutations where B and E are not the first among their respective neighbor sets, retaining the degree conditions. This feels like a linear extension problem under precedence constraints, and I’m considering using inclusion-exclusion to count valid arrangements.**Validating sequence constraints**\n\nI’m analyzing the conditions under which the pieces can be chosen. If B is selected before any of A, C, or E, it's invalid since B's degree will still be 3 then. I define two violation sets: V1, where B comes before A, C, or E, and V2, where E comes before D, F, or B. These violations can’t occur simultaneously since E can't precede B if B is also before E due to their dependencies. \n\nI determine valid permutations by subtracting these violations from the total permutations. Given the symmetry in constraints, I can conclude that |V1| equals |V2|. Each set has 180 permutations, leading to a total of 360 valid arrangements after the calculations. Finally, I double-check different sequences to ensure they align with these constraints, confirming that my counts have plausibly covered every scenario.**Analyzing triangle probabilities**\n\nI'm considering the conditions for forming an obtuse triangle with sides a, b, and 1, under the constraint that a and b are between 0 and 1. To be obtuse, the longest side must fulfill the condition where its square is greater than the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The only relevant inequalities here are that a + b must be greater than 1, and 1 must indeed be the longest side. Now, I need to check the area where both a + b > 1 and a² + b² < 1 intersect.\n\nThe area of interest lies within the unit square and can be represented graphically, using the quarter-circle equation. I consider its interaction with the diagonal line a + b = 1, verifying limits and points to ensure my boundaries are accurate. With the right calculations, I should be able to efficiently determine the probability I’m exploring and confirm symmetry within this scenario.**Exploring obtuse triangle conditions**\n\nI'm checking the inequality to see when a, b, and 1 can form an obtuse triangle, focusing on the areas defined by the quarter-circle and the lines in the unit square. I found that all points within the triangular area under the line satisfy the circle's constraints. \n\nNow, I’m calculating the region that satisfies the conditions of a + b > 1 and lies within the quarter-circle. The area of interest can be defined as the difference between the quarter-circle area and the triangular area, leading me to derive a probability of roughly 0.285. I still need to consider if there are other scenarios for obtuse angles in different orientations of the triangle.{\n \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, valid permutations exclude those with B before A, C, E or E before D, F, B, resulting in 360 valid arrangements. For Problem 2, obtuseness occurs if the longest side 1 satisfies 1^2 > a^2 + b^2 while adhering to the triangle inequality a + b > 1. The respective area in the unit square is derived from the quarter circle minus the area of a right triangle, leading to the expression (pi-2)/4.\",\n \"answer_1\": \"360\",\n \"answer_2\": \"(pi-2)/4\"\n}</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Only the two middle pieces (top-middle B and bottom-middle E) ever have degree 3; corners always have degree ≤2. Thus the only forbidden moves are eating B before any of {A, C, E} or eating E before any of {D, F, B}. In permutations of {A, B, C, D, E, F}, the event “B is earliest among {A, B, C, E}” has probability 1/4, and similarly for “E is earliest among {D, E, F, B}”; these events are disjoint. Hence valid orders = 6! * (1 − 1/4 − 1/4) = 360. Problem 2: With sides (a, b, 1) where a, b ∈ [0,1], triangle condition is a + b > 1. The triangle is obtuse only at the angle opposite side 1, i.e., when 1 > a^2 + b^2. The desired probability is the area in the unit square satisfying both: the portion of the quarter unit disk above the line a + b = 1, which is (area of quarter circle) − (area of triangle under the line) = pi/4 − 1/2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"360\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(pi-2)/4\"\n}",
