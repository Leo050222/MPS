  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Calculating divisibility conditions**\n\nI’m exploring if a value \\( q \\) is a multiple of 5 and how that relates to divisibility. It makes sense to rewrite this as a requirement for \\( \\text{floor} = 5p \\), meaning \\( \\text{floor mod 5} = 0 \\). I’ll calculate general floor values for \\( r \\) under mod 5 conditions, noting cases for \\( r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\). The end goal is to see if \\( 2qr + c \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\), with the quotient \\( p \\) being prime.**Analyzing cases with \\( r \\)**\n\nI’m breaking this down by value of \\( r \\). For \\( r = 0 \\), \\( c = 0 \\) leads to \\( 2q \\cdot 0 + 0 = 0 \\), which is always divisible by 5. But, \\( p = q^2 \\) isn’t prime unless \\( q = 1 \\), which we can discard. For \\( r = 1 \\), \\( c = 0 \\) implies \\( 2q \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\), meaning \\( q \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\). When I set \\( q = 5t \\), I can further examine the expressions and conditions, being careful with each step!**Computing with \\( q = 5t \\)**\n\nI’m computing with \\( q = 5t \\): I find \\( 5 \\times (25t^2) + 10t = 125t^2 + 10t \\), which simplifies to \\( 5 \\times (25t^2 + 2t) \\). That means \\( p = 25t^2 + 2t = t(25t + 2) \\). For \\( p \\) to be prime, I see \\( t = 1 \\) leads to 27, which is composite. If \\( t = 0 \\), then \\( p = 0 \\), not prime. Now moving to the case with \\( r = 2 \\), checking similar conditions results in \\( q \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\) again.**Plugging in values for \\( q \\)**\n\nI'm plugging in \\( q = 5t \\): I get \\( 5 \\times 25t^2 + 20t = 125t^2 + 20t \\), which simplifies to \\( 5 \\times (25t^2 + 4t) \\), or \\( 5t(25t + 4) \\). If \\( t \\geq 1 \\), I see it’s composite. If \\( t = 1 \\), then \\( p = 29 \\), which is prime. Since \\( t = 0 \\) leads to 0, not prime, my valid solution is \\( r = 2 \\) and \\( q = 5 \\), giving me \\( n = 27 \\) which verifies correctly!**Exploring cases \\( r = 3 \\) and \\( r = 4 \\)**\n\nI'm analyzing case \\( r = 3 \\) and I find my conditions lead to \\( q \\equiv 4 \\mod 5 \\), so \\( q = 5t + 4 \\). The floor calculates to \\( 5q^2 + 6q + 1 \\). After factoring, I realize \\( p(t) = 25t^2 + 46t + 21 \\) tends to be composite, as trials show. Moving to \\( r = 4 \\), the condition for \\( q \\) remains consistent at \\( q = 5t + 4 \\). Here, I find \\( p = 25t^2 + 48t + 23 \\), leading to \\( p \\) being prime for \\( t = 0 \\). So this proves fruitful with another solution!**Summarizing calculations and formatting in JSON**\n\nI’ve factored \\( p(t) \\) and verified that for \\( t \\geq 0 \\), \\( p \\) is mostly composite except when \\( t = 0 \\). The only primes I found are \\( 23 \\) and \\( 29 \\), which sum to \\( 52 \\). Now, I must present the answers in JSON format, making sure no trailing commas are included. I also need to ensure the reasoning is concise and valid, without excessive internal thoughts. I’m sticking to a single line for reasoning to keep it clear and clean!**Formulating problem results in JSON**\n\nFor Problem 2, I have defined \\( n = 5q + r \\) with \\( 0 \\leq r < 5 \\). When calculating \\( \\text{floor}(n^2/5) \\) and focusing on multiples of 5, I found that only \\( (r, q) = (4, 4) \\) yields \\( p = 23 \\) and \\( (r, q) = (2, 5) \\) yields \\( p = 29 \\), summing to \\( 52 \\). I’ve confirmed the calculations work with the definitions of \\( q \\) and \\( r \\). Now, it’s time to produce the JSON!</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Donuts in dozens ⇒ ceil(550/12)=46 dozens; cost=46×7.49=344.54. Problem 2: Let n=5q+r (0≤r<5).
