  "math_problem": "Victoria wants to order at least 550 donuts from Dunkin' Donuts for the HMMT 2014 November contest. However, donuts only come in multiples of twelve. Assuming every twelve donuts cost $7.49, what is the minimum amount Victoria needs to pay, in dollars? Instead of computing the minimum cost to acquire at least the required number of units when purchases are constrained to multiples of the base quantity, simply find $e = \\left\\lfloor 550 / 12 \\right\\rfloor - 43$. There are two prime numbers $p$ so that $5 p$ can be expressed in the form $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n^{e}}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ for some positive integer $n$. What is the sum of these two prime numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing modular squares**\n\nI'm working through some mathematical reasoning here, specifically regarding \\(n^2\\) modulo 25 and its relation to prime \\(p\\). If \\(n^2 = 25p\\), \\(p\\) must be a perfect square, which isn't possible. This leads me to conclude that \\(n\\) isn't divisible by 5. I’m computing possible values of \\(n\\) that mirror squared residues modulo 25, yielding {1, 4, 6, 9, 11, 14, 16, 19, 21, 24}. Among these, I'm focusing on residues less than or equal to 4, which narrows it down to 1 and 4.**Exploring perfect squares**\n\nI’m diving into the equations where \\(n^2\\) must equal \\(25p + 1\\) or \\(25p + 4\\). This gives us two cases to analyze. For the first case, I can express it as \\((n-1)(n+1) = 25p\\). These two factors differ by 2, so they must be of the same parity, which affects their greatest common divisor (gcd). If \\(n\\) is odd, then \\(n-1\\) and \\(n+1\\) are even, making their gcd equal to 2. Conversely, if \\(n\\) is even, the factors are both odd, resulting in a gcd of 1.**Determining gcd and factors**\n\nI'm considering pairs of numbers that are two apart and odd, which would mean their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1. Given that \\(n-1\\) and \\(n+1\\) multiply to \\(25p\\) with a factorization of \\(5^2 \\times p\\), I'm looking at cases where \\(p\\) is a prime different from 5. \n\nFor a subcase with a gcd of 1 (when \\(n\\) is even), I'm trying to factor \\(25p\\) into pairs, like (1, 25p), (5, 5p), or (p, 25). I find that attempting (1, 25p) leads to an impossible scenario, and similarly for the pair (5, 5p). So far, nothing works out!**Analyzing factor pairs for gcd**\n\nIn looking at the pair (25, p), if I set \\(n-1 = 25\\), then \\(n\\) equals 26, which makes \\(n+1 = 27\\) equal to \\(p\\), but that's not prime. I realize that the product needs both factors to be significant. \n\nSince they need to be coprime, only one factor can be divisible by 5. This means I can't find valid combinations for \\(gcd = 1\\). So, I'm left with the \\(gcd = 2\\) case, which makes \\(n\\) odd, thus making both \\(n-1\\) and \\(n+1\\) even. This leads me to think they must each be divisible by 2.**Validating solutions and finding primes**\n\nI’m confirming that \\(m = -1 + 25k\\) leads us to \\(p = k(25k - 2)\\). When I plug in \\(k = 1\\), I find \\(p = 23\\) is prime! Now, I’ve verified \\(n^2 = m^2 = 25p + 1\\) gives \\(576 = 24^2\\), which is consistent. I seem to have found a second solution, \\(p = 23\\), by checking pairs again. \n\nIt turns out the only primes are \\(p = 23\\) and \\(p = 29\\), yielding a sum of 52. I'll prepare to present this as JSON without further commentary.</think>\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"52\"\n}",
