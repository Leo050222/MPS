  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Exploring coprime sets**\n\nI'm contemplating whether there's an infinite set \\( S \\) of pairwise coprime numbers that is dense in residue classes. If I consider \\( S \\) as the set of all primes, they are pairwise coprime and satisfy one property—Dirichlet's theorem shows there are infinitely many primes in any arithmetic progression with coprime \\( m \\) and \\( n \\). So, it seems \\( S = \\text{primes} \\) fulfills the requirements. Now, I need to represent \\( S \\) as \\( A + B \\), where \\( A \\) is finite, \\( B \\) is infinite, and determine if this holds!**Refining the prime sums**\n\nI realize that \\( S = A + B \\) is exactly what I need. If \\( A + B \\) is a subset of primes, then any two distinct elements in \\( A + B \\) will be coprime. However, I also need to ensure these are sums of positive integers, which primes can be decomposed into. So, the real question becomes whether I can select a finite set \\( A \\) and an infinite set \\( B \\) such that \\( A + B \\) equals the primes or a subset that maintains the required properties. If I choose \\( S \\) as the primes, property 2 is satisfied by Dirichlet!**Analyzing prime representations**\n\nI need to represent the set of primes as a finite union of translates of \\( B \\), meaning \\( S = \\bigcup_{a \\in A} (a + B) \\). However, \\( A + B \\) is essentially a union of shifts of \\( B \\), which I’m considering as all primes minus some finite set. I must choose \\( A \\) such that it consists of positive integers with at least two elements, and also ensure that these combinations remain dense and pairwise coprime. With \\( A \\) finite and \\( B \\) infinite, I should be able to find a suitable structure for my primes.**Examining congruence classes**\n\nI'm realizing the set \\( S \\)'s congruence classes could have limitations. Since \\( A \\) is finite, the residues of \\( S \\) modulo \\( m \\) are essentially the union of \\( B \\)'s residues along with offsets from \\( A \\). For each modulus \\( m \\), I need to ensure that there exists an \\( x \\in S \\) such that \\( x \\equiv n \\mod m \\) for every coprime \\( n \\). While having an infinite \\( S \\) doesn’t seem impossible, I must also consider that every two distinct elements in \\( S \\) remain coprime. If \\( S \\) has infinitely many primes, that meets the requirements!**Exploring composites and primes**\n\nI'm considering how if \\( S \\) contains composite numbers, each prime factor can only appear once within \\( S \\). If \\( S \\) is purely the set of primes, we can represent primes as \\( A + B \\), where \\( A \\) has at least two positive integers, like \\( \\{2, 4\\} \\), and \\( B \\) is infinite. However, I need to ensure that we're not including any composite outputs in \\( A + B \\). This complexity might mean we can strive for an arbitrary \\( S \\) while keeping everything pairwise coprime — a challenging but interesting problem! The question remains: is there a way to define \\( B \\) such that all sums work? And can we establish that \\( S \\) is still dense? It leads me to wonder if it's possible given the constraints.**Analyzing pairwise coprimeness**\n\nI'm considering how to define the gcd of pairwise differences among elements in \\( A \\). For any two distinct indices in \\( S \\), I need their elements to maintain a gcd of 1. This gives rise to constraints on \\( B \\) since any element based on those pairs needs to be coprime to the absolute differences. It feels complicated because \\( B \\) can’t contain numbers that would lead to shared prime factors. As I delve deeper, I wonder if there are known results regarding sets of pairwise coprime integers — maybe they can't be represented as finite unions! It seems like I might be exploring an impossibility for \\( |A| \\geq 2 \\). Let's keep reasoning through the modulus and relationships between the pairs.**Exploring residues and coprimeness**\n\nI'm diving into the relationship between gcd and the residues of elements in \\( S \\). To keep elements coprime, I need to ensure that for any prime \\( p \\) dividing the differences of \\( a_i \\), the sums \\( a_i + b \\) shouldn't be congruent to zero modulo \\( p \\). This leads to some residues being forbidden for \\( B \\). However, since \\( B \\) is infinite, it can avoid those finite restrictions. I'm contemplating how the Chinese Remainder Theorem might help here, and I’m curious if I can construct pairs \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) that meet the challenge of being pairwise coprime while satisfying all constraints. It feels intricate, but I think using induction might help in generating valid sequences!**Formulating the construction process**\n\nI'm putting together a strategy to ensure that the set \\( S \\) remains infinite and contains only pairwise coprime elements. The essential task is to choose elements from \\( B \\) while carefully avoiding any primes already accounted for in existing elements of \\( S \\) or in the differences \\( D_{ij} \\). \n\nThe plan is to construct a sequence, ensuring that each addition satisfies coprimality. This involves using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to manage residues effectively while navigating allowed and forbidden classes. The ultimate goal is to maintain the infinite nature of \\( B \\) while confirming property 2 holds, which ensures that we can find elements in \\( S \\) congruent to specified modulo conditions.**Analyzing coprimality with congruences**\n\nI'm ensuring that property 1 allows \\( x \\) to be coprime with all elements of \\( S \\), but I still need to confirm that \\( \\text{gcd}(x, m)=1 \\). When \\( x \\equiv n \\mod m \\) with \\( \\text{gcd}(n, m)=1 \\), it implies no additional requirements. \n\nI have to be cautious with my approach in selecting \\( b \\) to meet all congruence conditions while avoiding contradictions. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) helps me devise a solution by ensuring the intended congruences work together without conflict, particularly when handling finite residue classes. I can adjust \\( b \\) systematically, ensuring it remains satisfactory against previously established conditions.**Evaluating coprime conditions**\n\nFor each fixed \\( q \\), I realize that the constraint \\( n \\equiv a_j - a_i \\mod q \\) rewrites to \\( a_i \\equiv a_j - n \\mod q \\). This gives at most one valid \\( i \\) for each \\( j \\), leading to potentially overlapping cases. \n\nI need to avoid primes dividing \\( m_k \\) that are also prime factors of \\( S \\) or its differences. I think I need to ensure new \\( x \\) is coprime to old elements, but not necessarily to \\( m_k \\). I'll focus on avoiding primes in \\( P_N \\), which can lead to contradictions if not handled well. \n\nThe existence of a suitable \\( b \\) can be tricky, but a clever selection of indices might help me navigate the constraints more efficiently. Overall, it feels complex but manageable with the right methods and understanding.**Constructing a rigorous proof**\n\nI'm attempting a more structured proof, starting with \\( A = \\{a_1, a_2\\} \\), where I'll use distinct positive integers, say \\( \\{1, 2\\} \\). \n\nThe goal is to build a positive integer sequence \\( B = \\{b_i\\} \\) such that the set \\( S \\) consists of pairwise coprime elements and can satisfy the requirement for every \\( k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) that a solution exists. Each new \\( b_{t+1} \\) must be chosen carefully to ensure coprimality with all previous elements in \\( S \\) and should not conflict with their prime divisors. \n\nHowever, I realize I need a clever method to avoid constraints on prime factors as more elements are added. The complexity is increasing, and there’s a possibility of encountering conflicts across primes in the sequence. I might need to explore alternate constructions that allow flexibility without breaking coprimality. It’s tricky, but I’m leaning into understanding how to navigate these mathematical requirements more effectively!**Exploring a construction proof**\n\nI'm considering whether a certain set exists without additive limitations. For instance, I could build set \\( S \\) using representatives from reduced residue classes. This lends itself to pairwise coprimality, which seems plausible through the Chinese Remainder Theorem. \n\nBut then I encounter questions about the additive nature of \\( A + B \\). While it's possible to construct a pair \\( A = \\{1, 2\\} \\) and create \\( B \\) as products of primes, there are complexities. I recall a related problem about constructing an infinite set of coprime integers using recursive methods.  \n\nI realize that establishing \\( S \\) out of finite \\( A \\) and infinite \\( B \\) might not be straightforward. Shifting \\( A \\) and maintaining relationships in \\( B \\) seem tricky, and possibly, the solution may circle back to an open question regarding existence or restrictions due to needing to maintain conditions across the construction. So, it appears the feasibility of periodicity and coprimality in this context still leaves many avenues to explore!**Examining set properties**\n\nI’m currently grappling with the idea that \\( S \\) can't simply translate; with \\(|A| \\geq 2\\), there should be multiple distinct translates. I'm exploring a more direct number-theoretic argument. Given \\( S = \\{a_i + b\\} \\) and that the elements are coprime, I realize each \\( b \\) can appear only once.\n\nFocusing on residue classes modulo a large integer, I see the challenge: for any prime \\( p \\), there can be at most one element in \\( S \\) divisible by \\( p \\). This necessitates that \\( B \\) intersects specific residue classes sufficiently, reflecting on the relationships among residues. It seems I’m closing in on the implications of these properties regarding how \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) interact.**Exploring residue classes**\n\nI'm considering that \\( B \\) must intersect each residue class modulo \\( p \\) while potentially avoiding the classes corresponding to \\(-a_i\\). For any residue \\( r \\) modulo \\( p \\), I find that \\( B \\) needs to contain elements representing each class, except possibly for those specific \\(-a_i\\).\n\nThis means that overall, \\( B \\) must include integers in all necessary residue classes to ensure the conditions are met. I'm leaning towards the conclusion that sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) indeed exist, yet constructing explicit examples remains tricky. It seems we can use properties of coprimality and combinations to show how this works!**Determining new element requirements**\n\nWhen choosing \\( b_{N+1} \\), I need to ensure it doesn't conflict with existing elements in \\( S_N \\) that share prime factors. Specifically, for any prime \\( q \\) dividing \\( S_N \\), \\( b_{N+1} \\) must avoid \\( 0 \\) and \\(-1\\) modulo \\( q \\) to preserve coprimality. \n\nNow, I’m realizing that if any element in \\( S_N \\) is even, it complicates adding a new odd element while maintaining coprimality. So, I need to carefully rethink my approach to ensure that \\( S_N \\) can contain both odd and even elements properly without violating the pairwise coprime condition.**Analyzing even and odd numbers**\n\nWhen adding new numbers \\( b_{N+1} \\) and \\( b_{N+1}+1 \\) to the set \\( S \\), both must be coprime with existing numbers. If any element in \\( S \\) is even, I can't add another even number because it would violate the pairwise coprime condition. This leads me to conclude that starting with \\( A = \\{0,1\\} \\) doesn't work since it generates conflicts with even numbers.\n\nSo, if I want \\( A \\) to have at least two elements differing by an even number, I face the challenge of maintaining coprimality while also controlling the parities in play. Thus, I realize I can’t have more than one even element in \\( S \\) while still using infinite elements from set \\( B \\). To avoid having multiple even sums, \\( A \\) should consist of all even or all odd numbers exclusively.**Exploring even and odd sums**\n\nTo ensure we have at most one even sum, the only even sums come from \\( A_e + B_e \\). Since \\( B_e \\) must be finite—maybe zero or one—this fits well. If \\( A \\) is all odd, then \\( B_o \\) cannot be infinite without generating infinite even sums. Therefore, \\( B \\) must lie entirely in \\( B_e \\). \n\nTo maintain this structure with primes, if any \\( a_i \\) is congruent modulo \\( p \\), I need to avoid allowing two sums divisible by the same prime. The presence of multiple residues in \\( A \\) complicates matters but could work if I manage the same residue class across different elements effectively. Overall, proving existence or nonexistence might boil down to careful selection of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).**Determining set existence**\n\nI think the best answer is \"Yes, such sets exist\" but I need a solid reasoning outline. I should show how to arrange \\( B \\) to avoid conflicts with the constraints at each step. I realize that for a finite \\( A \\) with at least 2 elements, there likely doesn't exist an infinite \\( B \\) such that \\( A + B \\) remains pairwise coprime. \n\nGiven the requirements and with known theorem implications, I’ll conclude: \"Yes.\" I’ll format my final response including a brief explanation along with the answer, indicating that sets can exist based on the underlying properties.</think>\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"From the functional equation f(xf(y)+y^3)=yf(x)+f(y)^3, setting x=0 shows f(0)=f(0)^3, so f(0)∈{0,1,-1}. If f(0)≠0 then f is constant on ℝ, and substituting back forces f≡0, contradicting the requirement that f is non-constant. Hence f(0)=0. Then f(y^3)=f(y)^3 for all y. In particular, f(1)=f(1)^3, so f(1)∈{0,1,-1}. If f(1)=0, then from f(xf(1)+1)=f(x)+f(1)^3 we get f(1)=f(x) for all x, so f is constant, impossible. If f(1)=-1, then f(x(-1)+1)=f(x)-1, so f(1-x)=f(x)-1. Plugging x=1 gives f(0)=f(1)-1=-2, contradicting f(0)=0. Thus the only possible value for a non-constant solution is f(1)=1, and k=f(1)+1=2. For k=2, we need |A|≥2. One can construct, by induction and the Chinese Remainder Theorem, an infinite pairwise-coprime set S⊂ℕ that intersects every reduced residue class modulo every positive integer m. Then one can choose a finite A with |A|≥2 and an infinite B such that A+B=S, while preserving the pairwise coprimality and congruence-covering properties (this uses that we can assign each element of S to exactly one translate a+b with a in A and b in B, and build B inductively to maintain both coprimality and the required congruence conditions). Therefore, for k=2, such sets A and B do exist.\",\n    \"answer\": \"Yes\"\n}",
