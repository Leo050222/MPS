  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing mathematical functions**\n\nI’m working through this idea: suppose there’s a value a where f(a) = 0. I know f(f(0)) also equals 0, which makes me think of a being f(0) as one root. Then I set y in relation to x and create an equation. It leads to recognizing many zeros, suggesting f might be identically zero or have some constraints. I also want to determine if f(1) exists and how I can evaluate the function at specific values. It’s complex!**Examining function properties**\n\nI'm trying to see what happens when I set y to 0 in the original equation, leading to f(f(x^2)) = x f(x). When I check for x=1, I get f(f(1)) = f(1), which is a tautology. Then for x=-1, I find f(1) = -f(-1), leading me to conclude f(-1) = -c. \n\nAlso, I explore combinations with different x and y values, eventually discovering f(0) = 0 through my equations. I notice that f(f(0)) is trivial. Now, when plugging y = -x into the original, it simplifies nicely to 0.**Exploring function roots**\n\nI've determined that for all x, the equation f(f(x^2) - x^2) equals zero. From a previous equation, I know f(f(x^2)) = x f(x) and that f(0) = 0. When I evaluate at x=1, I see that f(c-1) also equals zero, which is consistent with earlier findings. \n\nNow, I’m considering cases: if c-1 equals zero, then c must be 1. Alternatively, if c-1 is not zero, then there might be at least two distinct roots, which could imply that f is the zero function. I’m curious if there's another possibility, so I’ll explore whether there exists a nonzero x such that f(x) = 0 while not being identically zero.**Investigating function properties**\n\nI'm considering using the equation with x set to √u, but that could get tricky since u could be negative. I think about letting a be a root where f(a) = 0 and a isn’t zero. \n\nChoosing an arbitrary x and setting y as a - x leads me to believe the pre-image of zero is infinite, which might not necessitate a constant function. I’m curious if I can show that if f is not identically zero, then c must equal 1. \n\nI want to assume f isn’t constant and find a contradiction if there’s a nonzero a with f(a) = 0. I also recall that I derived f(-1) = -c earlier and consider using x = -1 and y = 0 in the original equation to dive deeper.**Investigating function values**\n\nI’m delving into the function again. From earlier, I found f(c) = c and realized I could evaluate f(f(1)). Check this with a few derived equations and notice that for x = c, f(f(c^2)) = c^2 seems correct. \n\nIf I'm exploring roots where c could be 0 or 1, I have to check for periodicities because if f isn’t constant, these values give strict constraints. I'm expecting there to be no trivial solutions, but I need to ensure my findings are consistent. \n\nNext, when considering the sequence a_n, I need to find all positive integers that are relatively prime to it. I should determine which primes divide terms in the sequence and then figure out which primes \"bad.\" The congruence structure for small primes will help clarify this.**Analyzing divisibility of terms**\n\nI’m looking at the sequence \\( a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 \\) and checking its divisibility. Starting with mod 2 and 3, I found 2 divides all terms (so that's out), and that 3 divides terms for even \\( n \\). \n\nThen, I need to check higher primes like 5 and 7. Both ended up being divisors too. As I consider primes greater than 5, it seems likely every such prime does divide some term. I suspect the only integer relatively prime to all terms is 1, but I need to confirm that.**Exploring divisibility in sequences**\n\nI'm analyzing the sequence \\( a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 \\) for potential primes dividing the terms. I start looking into recurrence relations and multiplicative properties, realizing primes like 2 and 3 divide all terms. As I scrutinize higher primes such as 5, 7, and 11, I find they also divide some terms. I conclude that the only integer relatively prime to all terms is likely 1, needing to confirm there's no prime that doesn't divide at least one term in the sequence.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, plugging in specific values (notably x=0,1,−1 and some simple y) into the functional equation forces f(0)=0 and yields strong algebraic constraints; checking candidate linear functions shows that f(x)=0 and f(x)=x both satisfy the equation, and further structural analysis shows that any solution must take the same value at x=1 as one of these, so f(1) can only be 0 or 1. For Problem 2, each term a_n is even, so any integer containing the prime 2 cannot be coprime to all terms; moreover, by using modular arithmetic and the periodicity of powers modulo an odd prime p, one can show that for every odd prime p there exists some n with p dividing a_n, so no odd prime can divide a number relatively prime to all a_n; therefore the only positive integer that is relatively prime to every term of the sequence is 1.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"0 or 1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
