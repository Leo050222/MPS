      "A3077": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$."

  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Simplifying candy equation**\n\nI’m working on determining the minimum candies eaten. The equation simplifies down to needing to eat (20 - 3n) candies, limited by n being less than or equal to 3. I need to maximize n, which gives the best result for minimizing candies eaten. The best integer that fits is n = 3, leading to minimal candies eaten being 11. I just need to ensure the reasoning is concise and clear!</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, express the numbers of skateboards and bicycles as 7k and 4k. Their difference is 3k, which equals 12, so k = 4 and thus d = k + 6 = 10. For Problem 2, let the final equal number of each color be n. Since blue starts at 3, n cannot exceed 3. To minimize candies eaten, choose the largest feasible n, which is 3. Then the total eaten is (10 - 3) + (7 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 11.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
