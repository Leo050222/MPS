      "A3130": "Storage space on a computer is measured in gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB), where $1 \\mathrm{~GB} = 1024 \\mathrm{MB}$. Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes."

  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Calculating percentage savings**\n\nI'm working through the problem about calculating savings. For the bike priced at $320 with a 20% discount, that's a $64 discount, making the sale price $256. Then, the helmet costs $80 with a 10% discount, which is an $8 discount, bringing it to $72. The total regular price is $400, while the sale total is $328. That results in savings of $72, equating to an 18% savings on the total purchase. I'll confidently provide \"18\" as my answer.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI'm labeling this as \"answer_2\" with the value \"18\" since that aligns with the numerical answer I need. Now, I must think about how to create a valid JSON string while embedding quotes. Trailing commas are a concern because they can make the JSON invalid, so I won't include them after the last item. My JSON will include three keys: \"reasoning\", \"answer_1\", and \"answer_2.\" The reasoning should summarize both problems concisely, while ensuring I escape any necessary quotes. Finally, I'll return the JSON without any extra commentary.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Convert 300 GB to megabytes: 300 * 1024 = 307200 MB. Then d = C - 307100 = 307200 - 307100 = 100. Problem 2: Regular total is 320 + 80 = 400. Sale prices: bike 320 * 0.8 = 256, helmet 80 * 0.9 = 72, so sale total is 328. Savings are 400 - 328 = 72. The percentage savings is 72 / 400 = 0.18 = 18%.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"18\"\n}",
