Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The computer was on for 100 hours. A day has 24 hours. Compute the remainder h when 100 is divided by 24: 24 * 4 = 96, and 100 - 96 = 4, so h = 4. Then k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11. Problem 2: We need three different numbers from {2, 3, 4, 6} that sum to 11. Check combinations: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9; 2 + 3 + 6 = 11; 2 + 4 + 6 = 12; 3 + 4 + 6 = 13. So the correct triple is 2, 3, 6. Their product is 2 * 3 * 6 = 36.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"36\"\n}",
