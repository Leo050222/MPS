Let R be the original price.\\nA 20% discount means the sale price is 80% of the original: 0.8R = 112.\\nSolve for R: R = 112 / 0.8 = 112 * (10/8) = 112 * (5/4) = 28 * 5 = 140.\\nWe are asked to find k = R - 128.\\nSo k = 140 - 128 = 12.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have (x + m)(x + n) = x^2 + (m + n)x + mn.\\nThe constant term is mn, and we are told this constant term equals -12.\\nSo mn = -12, with m and n integers.\\nWe list all integer factor pairs of -12:\\n1 * (-12), 2 * (-6), 3 * (-4), (-1) * 12, (-2) * 6, (-3) * 4.\\nFrom these, the possible values for m are: 1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3, 4, 6, 12, -4, -6, -12 (depending on which is called m or n).\\nAny integer not in this set cannot be m.\\nTypically, the multiple-choice options would include some integer that’s not in this list; for example, 5 is impossible, since there’s no integer n such that 5n = -12.\\nThus the value that cannot be m is 5.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"12\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"5\"\n}",
