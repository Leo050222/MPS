We are told this sum equals 27, so 3m = 27, giving m = 9. We are asked not for the product but for p = 100(m - 177/20). Substitute m = 9: m - 177/20 = 9 - 177/20. Write 9 as 180/20, so 9 - 177/20 = 180/20 - 177/20 = 3/20. Then p = 100 * (3/20) = (100/20)*3 = 5*3 = 15. So answer_1 = 15.\\n\\nProblem 2: The statement 'x % of 60 is 12' translates to (x/100)*60 = 12. Simplify: 60x/100 = 12. Reduce 60/100 to 3/5, so (3/5)x = 12. Solve for x: x = 12 * (5/3) = 20. Now we need 15% of x, which is (15/100)*x = (15/100)*20. Compute: 15*20/100 = 300/100 = 3. So answer_2 = 3.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"15\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
