  "math_problem": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$. Shuxin begins with $d$ red candies, 7 yellow candies, and 3 blue candies. After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining. What is the smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Let the numbers of skateboards and bicycles be 7k and 4k. The difference is 7k - 4k = 3k, which equals 12, so k = 4. Then d = k + 6 = 10. Shuxin starts with 10 red, 7 yellow, and 3 blue candies. After eating some, let the equal remaining number of each color be n. Then 0 ≤ n ≤ 3 (since blue starts at 3). The total eaten is (10 - n) + (7 - n) + (3 - n) = 20 - 3n, which is smallest when n is largest, i.e., n = 3. Thus the smallest possible number of candies Shuxin ate is 20 - 3·3 = 11.\",\n  \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
