  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Evaluating integer constraints**\n\nI'm thinking about how to set n over positive integers to keep my expression as an integer. For each n, there's a constant k that relates to n and the expression. I need to compute k by defining it as n minus T(n). If T(n) is an integer for some n, then k is constrained to keep the equality valid for all n. I can set up an equation from this, leading to a cubic in n. This might allow for integer roots based on specific m values.**Analyzing integer relationships**\n\nSo, I’m looking at the relationship they require where n equals m plus k, and I can substitute to find m as n minus k. This leads to the equation n³ + 3 equals (n-k)(n² + 7). When I expand the right-hand side and set up an equation, I get a quadratic in which k and n must both be integers. For these n values to work, the discriminant has to be a perfect square. I’m also considering the original divisibility condition: n² + 7 must divide n³ + 3.**Computing polynomial relationships**\n\nI’m performing polynomial division with n³ + 3 divided by n² + 7. The quotient is n, and I find the remainder to be 3 - 7n. This leads to the fraction being n plus (3 - 7n)/(n² + 7). For this to be an integer, n² + 7 must divide -(7n - 3). \n\nI've derived that k needs to remain constant across values of n, such that k = n minus the value from my expression. After simplification, k equals (7n - 3)/(n² + 7). Now, for each n, k has to be an integer and independent of n.**Exploring integer relationships**\n\nI need to find positive integers n and k that meet two conditions. First, n² + 7 must divide 7n - 3, which directly leads to the second condition where k equals (7n - 3)/(n² + 7) and must also be a positive integer. This guarantees that the expression's value equals n minus k, which is automatically an integer. They also mention that this must hold true for each positive integer n, so I should first find n values that maintain integrality and then check if k remains constant across them.**Calculating k and m values**\n\nI started by determining the conditions for positive integers n and k, setting up that n² + 7 must divide 7n - 3. After checking possible small values for n, I found that only n = 2 and n = 5 work, both yielding k = 1. This appears consistent across my calculations. Then, I moved to the quadratic equation and analyzed the roots, concluding that for them to differ by m - 1, I only accepted m = 6. I discarded m = -10/3 as it leads to a negative difference.**Formatting reasoning**\n\nI need to include the reasoning for both problems in the same string, ensuring it's valid JSON without a trailing comma after the last key. \n\nFor problem 1, I calculated the allowable small values of n, specifically n = 2 and n = 5, which gave me the integers 1 and 4. This leads to k being equal to 1 since n equals the value plus 1. For problem 2, I used the formula for the difference of roots, set it equal to m - 1, and found m = 6 and -10/3. Since m must be greater than or equal to 1, I restrict it to just m = 6.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We need (n^3+3)/(n^2+7) to be an integer for positive integers n. Perform polynomial division: (n^3+3)/(n^2+7) = n + (3-7n)/(n^2+7). For integrality, (3-7n)/(n^2+7) must be an integer. For large n, the denominator dominates the numerator in absolute value, so only small n can work. From |3-7n| ≥ n^2+7, we get n^2 - 7n + 10 ≤ 0, which implies 2 ≤ n ≤ 5. Checking n = 2,3,4,5: only n = 2 and n = 5 make the expression integral: for n=2, the value is 1; for n=5, the value is 4. In both cases the original n equals the expression plus 1 (2 = 1+1 and 5 = 4+1). Thus the required constant k is 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: For the quadratic 2x^2 - m x - 8, let its zeros be r1 and r2. The difference in zeros is |r1 - r2| = sqrt(Δ)/|a|, with a = 2 and discriminant Δ = m^2 - 4·2·(-8) = m^2 + 64. So |r1 - r2| = sqrt(m^2 + 64)/2. The problem states that the zeros differ by m - 1, which we interpret as |r1 - r2| = m - 1. Therefore sqrt(m^2 + 64)/2 = m - 1. Since the left side is nonnegative, we require m - 1 ≥ 0, hence m ≥ 1. Squaring: (m^2 + 64)/4 = (m - 1)^2 leads to m^2 + 64 = 4(m^2 - 2m + 1) = 4m^2 - 8m + 4, so 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0. Solving this quadratic gives m = 6 or m = -10/3. The restriction m ≥ 1 eliminates m = -10/3, leaving m = 6 as the only acceptable value.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
