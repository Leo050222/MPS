  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Exploring radical squares**\n\nI’m thinking about squares of radicals in a form like c√d and how to equate them. For instance, if I set √b = t√6 with t being a rational number greater than zero, and let t=3, then b becomes 6t², which should also be an integer. \n\nNext, I consider a scenario with r, setting √b = r√6, leading to b=6r² while also ensuring a² + b = 15. I realize a must be an integer, so now I'm figuring out which values fit well in this case. The possibilities for a² should be perfect squares that divide 54—making things interesting!**Analyzing perfect squares and dice rolls**\n\nI realized that \"a²\" is automatically a perfect square. So when I intersect with the set {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54}, I only get {1, 9}. This means a² can be either 1 or 9, leading to a being ±1 or ±3. \n\nNow when I compute b, if a² is 1, b equals 54, and if a² is 9, then b is 6. I see that only a²=9 matches the constraint a² + b=15, so I determine a to be 3. \n\nNext, I need to find k as a + 3, resulting in k=6, and now I consider how many rolls are needed to see all numbers on the die at least once. That links to the coupon collector problem!**Defining the rolling process**\n\nI'm trying to define the rolling process where I keep track of distinct faces seen so far, which I'll call m, alongside the current face rolled. The transition probabilities will depend on what was just rolled, but thanks to symmetry, the distribution is influenced only by m, not the specific numbers. \n\nWhen I roll a face i, the next roll is uniformly random across the remaining five faces. I have to think about the probabilities of rolling a new face based on how many unseen faces there are. I'll denote N as 6 and define the state of the process based on m, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 6, to calculate the expected additional rolls needed.**Defining transition probabilities**\n\nTo define the transitions, I realize I only need m, knowing that the current roll shows one of the seen faces. Due to symmetry, I can determine how many faces are unseen among the remaining five. Since there are N - m unseen faces, and the current face isn’t counted again, the candidate set size is N - 1, which is 5.\n\nI find that the probability of rolling a new distinct face is (N - m) / (N - 1). This sets up a Markov chain based on m. I also need a base case for when no rolls have happened. Since the first roll will always be new, the initial roll counts as 1, putting us in state m = 1.**Calculating expected rolls**\n\nTo find the expected number of rolls needed to see all faces, I establish that the total expected rolls equal 1 plus E_1, the expected additional rolls from state m. The probability of rolling a new distinct face gives me a recursive formula to work with. Eventually, I calculate that for general N, the expected number rolls can be represented as 1 + (N-1)H_{N-1}.\n\nAfter calculating for N=6, I find the total expected number of rolls to be 149/12. Now, I’ll prepare a JSON output containing only the answer as specified. \n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"149/12\"\n}</think>\n\nTo express √(15 + √216) in the form a + √b with integers a and b, square both sides:\n\n(a + √b)² = a² + 2a√b + b = 15 + √216.\n\nMatch rational and irrational parts:\n\n1) a² + b = 15  \n2) 2a√b = √216 = 6√6.\n\nFrom 2), a√b = 3√6. So √b must be proportional to √6. Let √b = r√6 (r rational), then a·r = 3 and b = 6r² must be integer. This leads to a² dividing 54, and using equation 1) plus integrality, you find a = 3 and b = 6. Thus\n\n√(15 + √216) = 3 + √6.\n\nThe problem defines k = a + 3, so k = 3 + 3 = 6. Mark’s cursed die therefore has k = 6 sides.\n\nNow consider the die process: a 6-sided die that cannot repeat the same face on consecutive rolls; every roll after the first is uniform over the other 5 faces. We want the expected number of rolls to see all 6 faces at least once.\n\nLet N = 6, and let E_m be the expected additional rolls needed starting from a state where exactly m distinct faces have been seen and we have just rolled some face (so m ≥ 1, with E_6 = 0). On the next roll, the probability of getting a new (previously unseen) face is:\n\np_m = (number of unseen faces among the 5 possible next faces) / 5  \n    = (N − m) / (N − 1)  \n    = (6 − m) / 5.\n\nWith probability p_m we move to m + 1 distinct faces; with probability 1 − p_m we stay at m distinct faces. This gives the recurrence:\n\nE_m = 1 + p_m E_{m+1} + (1 − p_m) E_m  \n⇒ p_m E_m = 1 + p_m E_{m+1}  \n⇒ E_m = 1/p_m + E_{m+1} = (N−1)/(N−m) + E_{m+1}.\n\nThus\n\nE_m − E_{m+1} = (N−1)/(N−m).\n\nSumming from m = 1 to N − 1:\n\nE_1 = Σ_{m=1}^{N−1} (E_m − E_{m+1})  \n    = Σ_{m=1}^{N−1} (N−1)/(N−m)  \n    = (N−1) Σ_{j=1}^{N−1} 1/j  \n    = (N−1) H_{N−1},\n\nwhere H_{N−1} is the (N−1)-th harmonic number.\n\nWe start before any rolls; the first roll always introduces the first new face, so total expected rolls is\n\nE_total = 1 + E_1 = 1 + (N−1) H_{N−1}.\n\nFor N = 6:\n\nH_5 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5  \n    = 137/60.\n\nThen\n\n(N − 1) H_{N−1} = 5 · 137/60 = 137/12,\n\nso\n\nE_total = 1 + 137/12 = (12/12 + 137/12) = 149/12.\n\nSo the expected number of rolls for Mark’s cursed 6-sided die to show every face at least once is 149/12.\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"149/12\"\n}",
