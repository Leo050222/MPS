  "math_problem": "Victoria wants to order at least 550 donuts from Dunkin' Donuts for the HMMT 2014 November contest. However, donuts only come in multiples of twelve. Assuming every twelve donuts cost $7.49, what is the minimum amount Victoria needs to pay, in dollars? Instead of computing the minimum cost to acquire at least the required number of units when purchases are constrained to multiples of the base quantity, simply find $e = \\left\\lfloor 550 / 12 \\right\\rfloor - 43$. There are two prime numbers $p$ so that $5 p$ can be expressed in the form $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n^{e}}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ for some positive integer $n$. What is the sum of these two prime numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Solving for prime numbers**\n\nSo, I've calculated e = 2. Now, I'm looking for two prime numbers p such that 5p can be written as floor(n^2 / 5) for some positive integer n. My task involves finding primes where 5p = floor(n^2 / 5). I need to ensure that n^2 falls within a specific interval related to 5p. I’m observing n^2 modulo 5 since it should equal 0, 1, or 4, which helps narrow down the possibilities for p.**Exploring n values for primes**\n\nI’m examining possible n^2 values modulo 5, which gives 0, 1, and 4. Since 25p is divisible by 5, the range from 25p to 25p+4 helps confirm my possibilities. I’m considering setting n as a multiple of 5, which leads to n = 5a. This gives me constraints where p must be a perfect square. However, since prime numbers greater than 3 can’t be squares, I realize that my original idea can't hold. So, n cannot be a multiple of 5.**Examining n values mod 5**\n\nI’m setting n to be congruent to 1, 2, 3, or 4 modulo 5, which means I can express n as 5a + r with r in that set. Then, I derive n^2 as a combination of these values. I'm setting up a relationship between p and a^2 that requires some modular constraints. I need to check if p remains an integer. There's also the consideration of whether multiple square values can exist within a specific range, focusing on roots and the boundaries of my intervals.**Calculating quadratic residues**\n\nI’m defining A and B based on square roots of multiples of p, calculating the length of the interval between them. For p ≥ 2, I find that this length is less than 1, indicating there can only be one integer n within that range. If n exists, it’s unique and near 5√p. I’ll also analyze potential values of t by looking at quadratic residues modulo 25, focusing specifically on residues that fit within the range of 0 to 4. Only 0, 1, and 4 remain as possible values.**Finding the two primes**\n\nI’m realizing that primes can only be perfect squares, which isn't right, so it's clear p can’t fit that condition. However, I've found a potential candidate when evaluating n values. After testing small integers, I discovered p=23 and p=29 are valid primes that fit the equation 5p = floor(n^2/5). Checking my calculations shows they both work. Thus, their sum is 52. I’ll summarize this into JSON format as needed, keeping the reasoning concise and avoiding excessive detail.**Finalizing the JSON format**\n\nI've determined that the primes are 23 and 29, which sum up to 52. Now, I need to format this into the correct JSON structure. I want to make sure to include double quotes for the keys as I craft it. My JSON will look like this:\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"...\",\n  \"answer\": \"52\"\n}\n\nI’ll prepare the final output neatly without any extra text.</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First compute e = floor(550/12) - 43 = 45 - 43 = 2. Then solve 5p = floor(n^2 / 5) for primes p and positive integers n. This is equivalent to finding primes p such that there exists n with 25p ≤ n^2 < 25p + 5. Checking the possible congruences shows n^2 must be either 25p + 1 or 25p + 4. These yield the two prime solutions p = 23 and p = 29. Their sum is 52.\",\n    \"answer\": \"52\"\n}",
