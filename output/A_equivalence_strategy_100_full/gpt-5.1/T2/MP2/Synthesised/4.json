  "math_problem": "Ava and Tiffany participate in a knockout tournament consisting of a total of 32 players. In each of 5 rounds, the remaining players are paired uniformly at random. In each pair, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is knocked out of the tournament. The probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other during the tournament is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of evaluating the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator representing the probability that the two designated players meet during the tournament, simply find $b$, the denominator of that probability when expressed as a reduced fraction. Let $p$ be a real number and $c \\neq 0$ an integer such that $c-0.1<x^{p}\\left(\\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}}\\right)<c+0.1$ for all (positive) real numbers $x$ with $(b-16)<x<10^{-100}$. Find the ordered pair $(p, c)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing tournament probabilities**\n\nI'm considering how in a single-elimination tournament with a fixed bracket, each pair of players has an equal chance of meeting if their positions align. The probability that they will face off is 1 in 31. This assumes random seeding and equal skill levels. But if the opponents are randomly re-paired each round, would the probability remain the same? I suspect it does, as exchangeability suggests the same 1/(n-1) probability applies. Now, I'll calculate this more rigorously.**Exploring opponent probabilities**\n\nI'm wondering if all 31 opponents are equally likely to be the one who eliminates Ava or the last she defeats. There's a theorem stating that in knockout tournaments with random pairings, the probability that any player j faces player i is 1/(n-1). Since the tournament structure is random, each of the 31 players is symmetric relative to Ava. However, Ava might meet multiple opponents, making the probabilities for individual meetings potentially larger. I need to calculate the expected number of distinct opponents Ava meets over her matches, but it seems that expectation isn't equal to 1.**Calculating probabilities for opponents**\n\nI realize I can't just assume that the probability is constant for all opponents. While it's true that each player j has the same probability, we also need to relate that probability to the expected number of opponents Ava plays. To compute that expected number, I can look at how many matches Ava is expected to play. \n\nFor each round, the probability that Ava survives is based on her winning fair matches. After some calculations, I found that the expected number of opponents she faces is 31/16. This leads to finding that the probability of Ava meeting any particular opponent, like Tiffany, is 1/16. Perfect!**Analyzing the expression**\n\nI'm looking at an inequality domain for positive x, specifically where (b-16)<x<10^-100, so it's clear that I'm focusing on values between 0 and 1e-100. Now, I need to analyze the expression \\( x^p * \\frac{(1-(1+x)^{10})}{(1+(1+x)^{10})} \\) as x approaches 0. I want to find real p and an integer c (not equal to zero) that keeps the expression within 0.1 of c for all tiny positive x. \n\nTo do this, I'll define \\( f(x) = x^p * g(x) \\), where g(x) represents the fraction. I need to compute the asymptotic behavior of g(x) as x approaches 0, using the binomial expansion.**Confirming behavior of the expression**\n\nI'm analyzing the expression further, specifically around the behavior of \\( g(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\) as x approaches 0. It appears that for very small x, g(x) approximates to \\(-5x\\), and consequently, \\( f(x) \\) behaves like \\(-5x^{p+1}\\). If \\( p+1 \\) is greater than 0, then \\( f(x) \\) approaches 0, which can't approximate a nonzero integer c, but c must be nonzero. \n\nThis leads me to conclude that I need \\( p = -1 \\) to keep the expression finite. Thus, I'll need to check higher-order terms to ensure the expression stays within 0.1 of -5 for all small x up to \\( 1e-100 \\). I'll compute the series further, using rough mathematics to verify my findings.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) Tournament probability and b:\\nIn a 32-player single-elimination tournament with random pairings each round and fair matches, consider Ava. Let N be the number of distinct opponents she faces. In each round r=1..5, she plays a match if she is still alive, which happens with probability (1/2)^{r-1}. Thus\\nE[N] = sum_{r=1}^5 (1/2)^{r-1} = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 = 31/16.\\nLet p_0 be the probability Ava meets any fixed other player (e.g., Tiffany). By symmetry over the 31 possible opponents, E[N] = 31 * p_0, so\\n31 * p_0 = 31/16  =>  p_0 = 1/16.\\nThus the probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other is 1/16, so a=1, b=16.\\n\\n2) Domain for x:\\nThe condition on x is (b-16) < x < 10^{-100} for positive x. With b=16, this becomes 0 < x < 10^{-100}.\\n\\n3) Asymptotics of the expression:\\nDefine\\nf(x) = x^{p} * (1 - (1+x)^{10}) / (1 + (1+x)^{10}).\\nFor small x, expand (1+x)^{10} = 1 + 10x + 45x^2 + O(x^3).\\nThen\\nnumerator = 1 - (1+x)^{10} = -10x - 45x^2 + O(x^3),\\ndenominator = 1 + (1+x)^{10} = 2 + 10x + 45x^2 + O(x^3).\\nSo\\n(1 - (1+x)^{10}) / (1 + (1+x)^{10}) = -5x + O(x^2).\\nTherefore\\nf(x) ~ x^{p} * (-5x) = -5 x^{p+1}  as x -> 0^+.\\n\\n4) Determining p and c:\\nWe need a real p and nonzero integer c such that, for all 0 < x < 10^{-100},\\n| x^{p} * (1 - (1+x)^{10}) / (1 + (1+x)^{10}) - c | < 0.1.\\nFrom the asymptotic -5 x^{p+1}:\\n- If p+1 > 0, then f(x) -> 0, so to stay within 0.1 of an integer for very small x, we would need c=0, which is forbidden (c ≠ 0).\\n- If p+1 < 0, then |f(x)| -> infinity as x -> 0^+, so it cannot stay within 0.1 of any fixed finite integer.\\nThus we must have p+1 = 0, i.e., p = -1.\\n\\nWith p = -1,\\nf(x) = x^{-1} * (1 - (1+x)^{10}) / (1 + (1+x)^{10}).\\nUsing the refined series,\\n(1 - (1+x)^{10}) / (1 + (1+x)^{10}) = -5x + O(x^2),\\nso\\nf(x) = -5 + O(x).\\nHence f(x) -> -5 as x -> 0^+.\\nFor 0 < x < 10^{-100}, the O(x) term is bounded by some constant times 10^{-100}, which is vastly less than 0.1. Therefore f(x) stays within 0.1 of -5 on the entire interval (0, 10^{-100}). No other integer c can satisfy this, because the values of f(x) in that interval are arbitrarily close to -5 and stay far (about 1 unit) from any other integer.\\n\\nThus the unique pair (p, c) satisfying the condition is p = -1, c = -5.\",\n  \"answer\": \"(-1,-5)\"\n}",
