  "math_problem": "The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to $k>0$, find $k$. Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition. A ladder is leaning against a house with its lower end $d$ feet from the house. When the lower end is pulled 9 feet farther from the house, the upper end slides 13 feet down. How long is the ladder (in feet)?",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Calculating ladder length**\n\nI’m working through an equation: 225 + y1^2 = 576 + y1^2 - 26y1 + 169. I realize that (y1 - 13)^2 is part of the right-hand side, leading me to simplify the equation. After canceling y1^2, I get down to 225 = -26y1 + 745. This means y1 equals 20. Finally, I calculate the ladder length using the Pythagorean theorem, resulting in 25. I want to present this as a concise JSON output.</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"From 2(3w + w) = 3w^2 we get w = 8/3, so d = w + 37/3 = 15. Let the ladder length be L, initial height be h. Then L^2 = 15^2 + h^2 and after moving the base, L^2 = 24^2 + (h - 13)^2. Equating and solving gives h = 20, so L^2 = 15^2 + 20^2 = 625 and L = 25.\",\n    \"answer\": \"25\"\n}",
