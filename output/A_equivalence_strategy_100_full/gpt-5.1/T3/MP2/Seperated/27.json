Hence z^2 + z - A divides f(z) - c for some constant c, and equivalently x1, x2 are distinct roots of f(z1) - f(z2) = 0 seen as a symmetric condition.\\nA more direct way: since x1, x2 are roots of z^2 + z - A, their sum is fixed (-1). Equation (3) says the quartic f(z) takes the same value at these two roots. Equivalently, the polynomial g(z) = f(z) - λ(z^2 + z - A) has a double root when z^2 + z - A and f(z) have the same values at the two roots; but this avenue gets messy.\\nInstead, use the fact x1 and x2 are the two roots of z^2 + z - A, so any symmetric polynomial in x1 and x2 can be expressed in terms of S = x1 + x2 = -1 and P = x1 x2 = -A.\\nWe require f(x1) = f(x2). Let f(z) = z^4 + 3z^3 + 5z.\\nThen f(x1) - f(x2) factors as (x1 - x2) times a symmetric expression. Since x1 ≠ x2, we need that symmetric factor equals 0.\\nCompute:\\nFor any polynomial f,\\n  f(x1) - f(x2) = (x1 - x2)·h(x1, x2),\\nwhere h is symmetric. For powers:\\n  x1^2 - x2^2 = (x1 - x2)(x1 + x2)\\n  x1^3 - x2^3 = (x1 - x2)(x1^2 + x1 x2 + x2^2)\\n  x1^4 - x2^4 = (x1 - x2)(x1^3 + x1^2 x2 + x1 x2^2 + x2^3)\\nAlso x1 - x2 factors out of each difference.\\nCompute f(x1) - f(x2):\\n  f(x1) - f(x2) = (x1^4 - x2^4) + 3(x1^3 - x2^3) + 5(x1 - x2)\\n  = (x1 - x2)[(x1^3 + x1^2 x2 + x1 x2^2 + x2^3) + 3(x1^2 + x1 x2 + x2^2) + 5]\\nSet the symmetric factor equal to zero:\\n  H := x1^3 + x1^2 x2 + x1 x2^2 + x2^3 + 3(x1^2 + x1 x2 + x2^2) + 5 = 0.\\nExpress H using S = x1 + x2 and P = x1 x2.\\nWe have standard identities:\\n  x1^2 + x2^2 = S^2 - 2P\\n  x1^3 + x2^3 = S^3 - 3SP\\n  x1^2 x2 + x1 x2^2 = x1 x2 (x1 + x2) = PS.\\nThus\\n  x1^3 + x1^2 x2 + x1 x2^2 + x2^3 = (x1^3 + x2^3) + (x1^2 x2 + x1 x2^2)\\n                                = (S^3 - 3SP) + PS\\n                                = S^3 - 2SP.\\nAlso\\n  x1^2 + x1 x2 + x2^2 = (x1^2 + x2^2) + x1 x2 = (S^2 - 2P) + P = S^2 - P.\\nSo\\n  H = (S^3 - 2SP) + 3(S^2 - P) + 5\\n    = S^3 - 2SP + 3S^2 - 3P + 5.\\nNow use S = -1 and P = -A.\\nCompute term by term:\\n  S = -1 => S^2 = 1, S^3 = -1.\\n  SP = (-1)(-A) = A.\\nThen\\n  S^3 - 2SP = -1 - 2A.\\n  3S^2 = 3·1 = 3.\\n  -3P = -3(-A) = 3A.\\nSo\\n  H = (-1 - 2A) + 3 + 3A + 5 = ( -1 + 3 + 5 ) + ( -2A + 3A ) = 7 + A.\\nCondition H = 0 gives\\n  7 + A = 0 => A = -7.\\nAdditionally, we must ensure x1, x2 are distinct: discriminant 1 + 4A ≠ 0 => 1 + 4(-7) = 1 - 28 = -27 ≠ 0, so the roots are indeed distinct.\\nSo the unique real value is A = -7.\\nThe problem asks for k = A + 9, so\\n  k = -7 + 9 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe need S = sum_{n=2}^{17} (n^2 + n + 1)/(n^4 + 2n^3 - n^2 - 2n).\\nFirst factor the denominator:\\n  n^4 + 2n^3 - n^2 - 2n\\nFactor by grouping:\\n  = n^2(n^2 + 2n - 1) - 2n\\nThis is not clearly helpful, so instead treat as a quartic in n and try to factor as n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2) or similar, because degree 4 and pattern suggests product of four linear factors.\\nCompute:\\n  n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2) = n(n^2 - 1)(n+2) = n[(n^2 - 1)(n+2)].\\nFirst compute (n^2 - 1)(n+2) = n^3 + 2n^2 - n - 2.\\nThen multiply by n: n^4 + 2n^3 - n^2 - 2n.\\nThis matches the denominator exactly.\\nSo denominator = n(n - 1)(n + 1)(n + 2).\\nThus we want\\n  S = sum_{n=2}^{17} (n^2 + n + 1)/[n(n - 1)(n + 1)(n + 2)].\\nNow perform partial fractions for the general term:\\n  (n^2 + n + 1)/(n(n - 1)(n + 1)(n + 2))\\nAssume decomposition into simple fractions of form\\n  A/(n - 1) + B/n + C/(n + 1) + D/(n + 2).\\nThen\\n  n^2 + n + 1 = A·n(n + 1)(n + 2) + B·(n - 1)(n + 1)(n + 2)\\n                + C·n(n - 1)(n + 2) + D·n(n - 1)(n + 1).\\nWe solve for A, B, C, D using convenient values of n.\\nLet n = 0:\\n  LHS: 0^2 + 0 + 1 = 1.\\n  RHS: terms with n factor vanish for A, C, D; only B survives:\\n    B·(-1)(1)(2) = -2B.\\n  So 1 = -2B => B = -1/2.\\nLet n = 1:\\n  LHS: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\\n  RHS: A·1·2·3 = 6A, other terms vanish.\\n  So 3 = 6A => A = 1/2.\\nLet n = -1:\\n  LHS: (-1)^2 + (-1) + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.\\n  RHS: C·(-1)(-2)(1) = 2C.\\n  So 1 = 2C => C = 1/2.\\nLet n = -2:\\n  LHS: 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.\\n  RHS: D·(-2)(-3)(-1) = -6D.\\n  So 3 = -6D => D = -1/2.\\nThus the decomposition is\\n  (n^2 + n + 1)/(n(n - 1)(n + 1)(n + 2))\\n    = (1/2)/(n - 1) - (1/2)/n + (1/2)/(n + 1) - (1/2)/(n + 2).\\nFactor out 1/2:\\n  term_n = (1/2)[ 1/(n - 1) - 1/n + 1/(n + 1) - 1/(n + 2) ].\\nSo the sum S is\\n  S = (1/2) * sum_{n=2}^{17} [ 1/(n - 1) - 1/n + 1/(n + 1) - 1/(n + 2) ].\\nSplit:\\n  S = (1/2)[ sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/(n - 1) - sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/n + sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/(n + 1) - sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/(n + 2) ].\\nReindex each sum in terms of harmonic numbers.\\nDefine H_m = sum_{k=1}^m 1/k.\\nFirst sum: sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/(n - 1).\\nLet k = n - 1; then n = 2..17 -> k = 1..16.\\nSo this sum is H_16.\\nSecond sum: sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/n = H_17 - 1 (since H_17 = 1 + sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/n).\\nThird sum: sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/(n + 1).\\nLet k = n + 1; then n = 2..17 -> k = 3..18.\\nSo this sum is H_18 - (1 + 1/2) = H_18 - 3/2.\\nFourth sum: sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/(n + 2).\\nLet k = n + 2; then n = 2..17 -> k = 4..19.\\nSo this sum is H_19 - (1 + 1/2 + 1/3) = H_19 - (1 + 1/2 + 1/3).\\nCompute 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 = 6/6 + 3/6 + 2/6 = 11/6.\\nSo fourth sum = H_19 - 11/6.\\nSubstitute into S:\\n  S = (1/2)[ H_16 - (H_17 - 1) + (H_18 - 3/2) - (H_19 - 11/6) ].\\nSimplify bracket:\\n  H_16 - H_17 + 1 + H_18 - 3/2 - H_19 + 11/6.\\nGroup harmonic terms: (H_16 - H_17 + H_18 - H_19) plus constants.\\nUse relations between H_m:\\n  H_17 = H_16 + 1/17.\\n  H_18 = H_17 + 1/18 = H_16 + 1/17 + 1/18.\\n  H_19 = H_18 + 1/19 = H_16 + 1/17 + 1/18 + 1/19.\\nCompute harmonic combination:\\n  H_16 - H_17 + H_18 - H_19\\n  = H_16 - (H_16 + 1/17) + (H_16 + 1/17 + 1/18) - (H_16 + 1/17 + 1/18 + 1/19).\\nThe H_16 terms cancel: H_16 - H_16 + H_16 - H_16 = 0.\\nCollect fractions:\\n  -1/17 + (1/17 + 1/18) - (1/17 + 1/18 + 1/19)\\n  = -1/17 + 1/17 + 1/18 - 1/17 - 1/18 - 1/19\\n  = (-1/17 + 1/17) cancel to 0, then we have (1/18 - 1/18) - 1/19 = -1/19.\\nSo harmonic part simplifies to -1/19.\\nNow constants: 1 - 3/2 + 11/6.\\nCompute in sixths:\\n  1 = 6/6, -3/2 = -9/6, 11/6 = 11/6.\\nSum: (6 - 9 + 11)/6 = 8/6 = 4/3.\\nSo the total inside bracket is\\n  -1/19 + 4/3.\\nFind common denominator 57:\\n  4/3 = 76/57, -1/19 = -3/57.\\nSo sum = (76 - 3)/57 = 73/57.\\nThus\\n  S = (1/2) * 73/57 = 73/114.\\nTherefore:\\n  Problem 1: k = 2.\\n  Problem 2: the sum equals 73/114.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"73/114\"\n}",
