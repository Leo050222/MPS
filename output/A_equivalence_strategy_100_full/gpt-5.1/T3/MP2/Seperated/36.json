Then n = s(s−1) + 1.\\nWe also know that S(n) = s, so we must have S(s(s−1)+1) = s and want the smallest positive integer n fulfilling this.\\nFirst, note that s must be a positive integer. Try small values of s:\\n- s = 1: n = 1·0 + 1 = 1. Then S(1) = 1, so it works. This gives n = 1 as a solution. Since S(n) grows slowly compared to n, n = 1 with s = 1 is clearly the smallest possible n.\\nFor this smallest n, S(n) = 1, so k = S(n) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have a unit cube and choose any 5 vertices. We want the maximum possible volume of the convex hull of these 5 points.\\nWe treat the figure as the convex hull of the chosen vertices. Since a tetrahedron (4 points) can have volume up to 1/3 (for example, picking one vertex and its three adjacent vertices forming a corner simplex), with 5 vertices we might get a larger volume by adding a fifth point that extends the hull.\\nUse coordinates for the unit cube: vertices are all (x,y,z) with x,y,z in {0,1}. We test configuration types.\\nA natural candidate is to take all vertices of one face (a square) plus one opposite vertex. For example, take the square z=0: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,0) and add the opposite vertex (1,1,1).\\nWe compute the volume of the convex hull P of these points.\\nThe convex hull P can be decomposed into two tetrahedra with disjoint interiors that fill P:\\n- Tetrahedron T1: A=(0,0,0), B=(1,0,0), C=(1,1,0), D=(1,1,1)\\n- Tetrahedron T2: A=(0,0,0), C=(1,1,0), D=(1,1,1), E=(0,1,0)\\nCompute volumes using the determinant formula V = |det(b−a, c−a, d−a)|/6.\\nFor T1: A=(0,0,0), B=(1,0,0), C=(1,1,0), D=(1,1,1).\\nVectors: B−A=(1,0,0), C−A=(1,1,0), D−A=(1,1,1).\\nMatrix:\\n[1 0 0]\\n[1 1 0]\\n[1 1 1]\\nDeterminant = 1*(1*1 − 0*1) − 0*(1*1 − 0*1) + 0*(1*1 − 1*1) = 1.\\nSo volume(T1) = 1/6.\\nFor T2: A=(0,0,0), C=(1,1,0), D=(1,1,1), E=(0,1,0).\\nVectors: C−A=(1,1,0), D−A=(1,1,1), E−A=(0,1,0).\\nMatrix:\\n[1 1 0]\\n[1 1 1]\\n[0 1 0]\\nDeterminant = 1*(1*0 − 1*1) − 1*(1*0 − 1*0) + 0*(1*1 − 1*0) = 1*(−1) − 1*0 + 0 = −1.\\nSo volume(T2) = |−1|/6 = 1/6.\\nThus volume(P) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3.\\nWe need to argue that 1/3 is maximal.\\nThe volume of any polytope inside the unit cube is at most 1. However, with only 5 vertices, the convex hull is at most a polyhedron that can be triangulated into tetrahedra with vertices among the chosen 5. Any such tetrahedron lies inside the cube, whose maximal tetrahedron volume is known to be 1/3 (this occurs when a tetrahedron has three edges along the edges of the cube from one corner). The convex hull of 5 vertices cannot exceed that maximal tetrahedral volume because adding a fifth vertex cannot create a volume larger than what the cube allows for a tetrahedron and, in fact, any configuration that might seem to enlarge volume beyond 1/3 can be seen to be composed of tetrahedra whose total volume cannot exceed 1/3 due to the unit-cube constraint and face positions. A configuration with five vertices including two opposite corners, for instance, yields smaller total volume polytopes since the points lie more “spread” but do not form any tetrahedron larger than 1/3, and overlapping tetrahedral decompositions do not increase volume.\\nHence 1/3 is achievable as shown and is the maximum possible.\\n\\nFinal answers: For Problem 1, k = 5. For Problem 2, the maximum volume is 1/3.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1/3\"\n}",
