  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe are told: “Instead of determining the largest additional exponent beyond 6 for which the prime power divides the factorial, simply find m = ⌊n/p⌋ − 36, where ⌊n/p⌋ is the first term in the sum for the exponent of p in n!.” Here n = 2000 and p = 23. So the first term in Legendre’s formula for v_23(2000!) is ⌊2000/23⌋.\\nCompute ⌊2000/23⌋. Since 23·86 = 1978 and 23·87 = 2001 > 2000, we have ⌊2000/23⌋ = 86.\\nThus m = ⌊2000/23⌋ − 36 = 86 − 36 = 50.\\nSo the requested value for Problem 1 is 50.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nS = {−100, −99, …, −1, 0, 1, …, 99, 100}, so |S| = 201. We choose a 50-element subset T uniformly at random from S and need the expected number of distinct absolute values in {|x| : x ∈ T}.\\nThe possible absolute values are 0,1,2,…,100, so there are 101 possible values.\\nLet’s count by linearity of expectation. For each a, define an indicator I_a that is 1 if there exists some x ∈ T with |x| = a, and 0 otherwise. Then the number of distinct absolute values in {|x| : x ∈ T} is X = Σ_{a=0}^{100} I_a. So E[X] = Σ_{a=0}^{100} E[I_a] = Σ_{a=0}^{100} P(I_a=1).\\nWe now compute P(I_a = 1), i.e., the probability that T contains at least one element with absolute value a.\\nCase a = 0:\\nThe only element with |x| = 0 is 0 itself. T is a 50-subset of S with 201 elements. P(I_0 = 0) is the probability that 0 is not chosen. We are choosing 50 elements from the 200 elements S \\\\ {0}, so\\nP(0 ∉ T) = C(200, 50) / C(201, 50).\\nThus\\nP(I_0 = 1) = 1 − C(200, 50) / C(201, 50).\\nCase a ≥ 1:\\nFor each a ∈ {1,…,100}, the numbers with |x| = a are −a and a, two distinct elements.\\nWe want P(I_a = 0) = P(neither a nor −a is chosen). That means we choose all 50 elements from the remaining 199 elements of S (excluding the two elements −a and a). So\\nP(I_a = 0) = C(199, 50) / C(201, 50).\\nHence\\nP(I_a = 1) = 1 − C(199, 50) / C(201, 50), for a = 1,…,100.\\nNow sum:\\nE[X] = P(I_0 = 1) + Σ_{a=1}^{100} P(I_a = 1)\\n     = (1 − C(200, 50)/C(201, 50)) + 100·(1 − C(199, 50)/C(201, 50)).\\nSimplify the combinatorial ratios using the identity C(N−1, k)/C(N, k) = (N−k)/N:\\nFirst, with N = 201, k = 50:\\nC(200, 50)/C(201, 50) = (201−50)/201 = 151/201.\\nNext, C(199, 50)/C(201, 50) can be written via C(199,50)/C(200,50) × C(200,50)/C(201,50). But we know C(199,50)/C(200,50) = (200−50)/200 = 150/200 = 3/4, and C(200,50)/C(201,50) = 151/201, so\\nC(199, 50)/C(201, 50) = (3/4)·(151/201) = 453/804.\\nTherefore:\\nP(I_0 = 1) = 1 − 151/201 = (201−151)/201 = 50/201.\\nP(I_a = 1) for a ≥ 1 is 1 − 453/804 = (804−453)/804 = 351/804.\\nWe can reduce 351/804 by gcd(351,804)=3: 351/804 = 117/268.\\nSo:\\nE[X] = 50/201 + 100·(117/268).\\nCompute 100·(117/268) = 11700/268. Reduce by gcd(11700,268)=4: 11700/268 = 2925/67.\\nSo\\nE[X] = 50/201 + 2925/67.\\nBring to a common denominator: lcm(201,67) = 201·67 = 13467 (since 201 and 67 are coprime). So\\n50/201 = (50·67)/13467 = 3350/13467,\\n2925/67 = (2925·201)/13467.\\nCompute 2925·201 = 2925·200 + 2925 = 585000 + 2925 = 587925.\\nThus\\nE[X] = (3350 + 587925)/13467 = 591275/13467.\\nCheck for reduction: 13467 = 3·3·1497 = 9·1497; 1497 = 3·499 so 13467 = 27·499. Test divisibility of 591275 by 3 and 9: sum of digits 5+9+1+2+7+5 = 29, not divisible by 3, so gcd with 3 (and 9,27) is 1. Test 499: 499·1000 = 499000; difference 591275−499000=92275; 499·185≈922? Actually 499·185 = 499·200 − 499·15 = 99800 − 7485 = 92315, which is not 92275, so not divisible by 499. Thus the fraction is fully reduced.\\nSo the expected number of distinct absolute values in {|x|: x ∈ T} is 591275/13467.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"50\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"591275/13467\"\n}",
