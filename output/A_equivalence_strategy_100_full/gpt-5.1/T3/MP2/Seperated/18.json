      "A401": "Trevor and Edward play a game in which they take turns adding or removing beans from a pile. On each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. The player who empties the pile wins. For example, if Trevor goes first with a pile of 5 beans, he can either add 4 to make the total 9, or remove 4 to make the total 1, and either way Edward wins by removing all the beans. There is no limit to how large the pile can grow; it just starts with some finite number of beans in it, say fewer than 1000. Before the game begins, Edward dispatches a spy to find out how many beans will be in the opening pile, call this $n$, then \"graciously\" offers to let Trevor go first. Knowing that the first player is more likely to win, but not knowing $n$, Trevor logically but unwisely accepts, and Edward goes on to win the game. Find a number $n$ less than 1000 that would prompt this scenario, assuming both players are perfect logicians. A correct answer is worth the nearest integer to $\\log _{2}(n-4)$ points. Instead of finding an initial pile size $n$ less than 1000 that is a losing position for the first player under perfect play, simply find $k = s(p) - 6$, where $p$ is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example, and $s(p)$ is the largest perfect square at most $p$."

  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Calculating pile size and colorings**\n\nI see I'm supposed to compute the pile size, p, by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile. Starting with 5, I add square 4, giving me p=9. Since s(p) is the largest perfect square ≤ p, that's 9. Now, k = s(p) - 6, resulting in k = 3. So answer_1 is \"3\". \n\nFor the next problem, I need to count inequivalent vertex colorings of a tetrahedron using colors {R,B,G}, ensuring no face is monochromatic.**Applying Burnside's lemma to colorings**\n\nI need to consider colorings of four vertices with three colors while taking into account the rotational symmetry of the tetrahedron, which is related to the tetrahedral group (isomorphic to A4 of size 12). Instead of applying Burnside's lemma directly to a restricted set, I can find the total orbits in the allowed set by subtracting orbits of forbidden colorings. It's tricky since equivalence classes could mix allowed and forbidden ones. So, I’ll apply Burnside's method on allowed colorings: for each rotation g, I'll count the colorings fixed by g that satisfy the restrictions and then average over |G|.**Classifying group elements of tetrahedron**\n\nI need to classify the elements of the tetrahedron's rotation group, which has twelve total elements: one identity, eight rotations about vertex-face axes (120° or 240°), and three 180° rotations through midpoints of opposite edges. Then, I’ll find the number of colorings fixed by each rotation while ensuring that no face (triangle) has all vertices the same color. \n\nI can compute total \"good\" colorings using inclusion-exclusion on faces. Starting with 3^4 total colorings, I’ll consider forbidden configurations where at least one face is monochromatic and manage overlaps through inclusion-exclusion. This part is definitely manageable!**Counting monochromatic faces in colorings**\n\nIt's important to note that a face being monochromatic only requires the three vertices of that face to be the same color, while the fourth vertex can be any color. When counting overlaps, I should consider that multiple faces might be monochromatic, potentially sharing colors.\n\nLet's define the total colorings as T = 3^4 = 81. For a specific face, like {1,2,3}, there are 3 choices (R, B, G) for those vertices and 3 choices for the fourth vertex, giving me 9 total. So, for each of the four faces, |Ai| = 9, leading to 36 when summed. Now, I need to look at intersections of Ai and Aj, where pairs may share edges or vertices.**Analyzing tetrahedron coloring overlaps**\n\nIn the tetrahedron, any two distinct faces share an edge, meaning they intersect in exactly two vertices. For instance, faces {1,2,3} and {1,2,4} share vertices 1 and 2. With a total of six edges, this means I have six unordered pairs of faces to investigate.\n\nWhen counting colorings, I see that having both vertices 1, 2, 3 and 1, 2, 4 the same color forces all four vertices to be monochromatic. This leads me to determine that intersections correspond to colorings where all four vertices are the same color, which gives me three possible colorings (R^4, B^4, G^4). Each intersection is counted multiple times, so I’ll need to compute intersections for each pair individually and handle the overlaps carefully. \n\nNow for the inclusion-exclusion principle: I find the total number of bad colorings based on monochromatic faces, which results in a count of 27 bad configurations when considering specific face constraints. Applying inclusion-exclusion gives a total of 54 good colorings fixed under the identity rotation. I need to now examine each rotation type and find the vertex permutations.**Counting tetrahedron colorings**\n\nI’m looking into the tetrahedral group with 8 elements generated by rotations. For the 120° rotation around a vertex, there are no valid colorings because any coloring would lead to at least one face being monochromatic. \n\nIn contrast, for the 180° rotation involving edge midpoints, each fixed coloring allows for two colors to differ. This gives 6 valid colorings per rotation. Summing contributions from the identity and rotations shows that, according to Burnside's lemma, there are 6 distinct colorings overall while adhering to the constraint of no monochromatic faces. \n\nI’ll double-check these findings by analyzing possible patterns and their implications on colorings. The allowed patterns typically are the 2-2 and 2-1-1 distributions, and it looks like the 2-2 coloring will yield distinct orbits under the tetrahedral group.**Preparing final JSON**\n\nI need to summarize my findings. In the tetrahedron, I found that every pair of vertices forms an edge, so there's only one orbit for 2-subsets of color pairs. For the 2-2 patterns, we have 3 distinct color orbits using combinations of colors, resulting in 3 orbits. \n\nFor the 2-1-1 patterns, I confirmed that no monochromatic faces exist, leading to another 3 distinct orbits, bringing my total to 6. I’ll format this properly in JSON, making sure not to include any invalid elements. Here it goes:\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, the largest square derived from 5 beans gives 9, thus k=9−6=3. For Problem 2, I counted vertex colorings avoiding monochromatic faces and used Burnside's Lemma yielding 6 distinct colorings.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, the example starts with 5 beans; adding the largest square (4) gives p = 9, whose largest square s(p) is 9, so k = s(p) - 6 = 3. For Problem 2, I first counted all vertex colorings of a labeled tetrahedron with three colors that avoid any face being monochromatic, then used Burnside's Lemma over the 12 rotational symmetries (identity, 3 edge-flip 180-degree rotations, and 8 vertex-centered 120-degree rotations) to count orbits; only the identity and the 180-degree rotations contribute nonzero valid fixed colorings, and averaging these gives 6 distinct colorings up to rotation.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
