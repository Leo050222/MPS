  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe are given primes p, q, r satisfying\\np/q - 4/(r+1) = 1.\\nRearrange:\\n p/q = 1 + 4/(r+1) = (r+1 + 4)/(r+1) = (r+5)/(r+1).\\nThus\\n p/q = (r+5)/(r+1).\\nSince p, q are primes and the fraction is in (not necessarily) reduced form, we simplify the right side. Let g = gcd(r+5, r+1). Then\\n g = gcd(r+5 - (r+1), r+1) = gcd(4, r+1).\\nSo g divides 4. Therefore g ∈ {1, 2, 4}.\\nWe have p = (r+5)/g, q = (r+1)/g, and both must be prime.\\nBecause r is prime, r is odd except r = 2. Consider cases:\\n1) r = 2:\\n r+1 = 3, r+5 = 7.\\n Then g = gcd(3,7) = 1.\\n So p = 7, q = 3, both primes, so this is a valid solution.\\n2) r odd prime > 2:\\n Then r+1 is even > 2, so not prime, but q = (r+1)/g might still be prime depending on g.\\nWe check each g:\\n- g = 1:\\n  q = r+1 is even > 2, not prime. So impossible.\\n- g = 2:\\n  Then r+1 must be divisible by 2 but not by 4 (since otherwise g could be 4). So r+1 ≡ 2 (mod 4). Then r ≡ 1 (mod 4). Now q = (r+1)/2 is an integer. For q to be prime, (r+1)/2 must be prime. Also p = (r+5)/2 must be prime, so r+5 is even, always true since r is odd. But we must also have gcd(r+5, r+1) = 2, i.e., (r+5)/2 and (r+1)/2 are coprime. This is automatic given g=2.\\n  However, there is an additional parity/field constraint: p and q are primes, so p and q must be odd except possibly 2. If q = 2 then r+1 = 4, r = 3. Check r = 3:\\n    r+1 = 4, r+5 = 8.\\n    g = gcd(4, 8) = 4, not 2, so this sits in g=4, not g=2. So no q=2 in this case.\\n  Now q is odd > 2 and p is odd > 2. That is possible in principle; we need a direct check instead.\\n- g = 4:\\n  Then r+1 is divisible by 4, so r ≡ 3 (mod 4). Then q = (r+1)/4, p = (r+5)/4. Both must be primes.\\nThis is a small-diophantine-style search over r with structural constraints, but we can argue more directly using congruences.\\nFrom p/q = (r+5)/(r+1), we also have\\n p(r+1) = q(r+5).\\nRearrange:\\n pr + p = qr + 5q\\n => r(p - q) = 5q - p.\\nThus\\n r = (5q - p)/(p - q).\\nSince r is prime and positive, we need numerator and denominator of same sign and |5q - p| divisible by |p - q|.\\nBut this approach becomes a small finite search once we note that r must be prime and the structure is simple. However, the problem statement tells us we do NOT need to find all p, q, r, but instead \\\"find n = r + 2009, where r is the prime number such that r + 1 equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term\\\". The subtracted term is 4/(r+1), whose numerator is 4. So the condition \\\"r + 1 equals the numerator\\\" means r + 1 = 4, so r = 3.\\nWe therefore ignore other potential solutions; the problem explicitly indicates to take r such that r+1 is the numerator of 4/(r+1), i.e., r+1 = 4, so r = 3.\\nThen\\n n = r + 2009 = 3 + 2009 = 2012.\\nAnswer to Problem 1: 2012.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have an 8×8 toroidal chessboard. FemtoPravis moves each femtosecond one square in a diagonal direction: NE, NW, SE, SW, each with probability 1/4. Coordinates can be taken modulo 8. Let a position be (x, y) with x, y in Z_8. A diagonal move changes the coordinates by one in absolute value in both directions:\\n NE: (x+1, y+1),\\n NW: (x-1, y+1),\\n SE: (x+1, y-1),\\n SW: (x-1, y-1),\\nall modulo 8.\\nWe want the probability that after 2012 steps, we are back at the original position.\\nBecause the board is a product of cycles (Z_8 × Z_8) and the motion in x and y coordinates are independent (each step changes x by ±1 and y by ±1 with symmetric probabilities), we can treat the x and y coordinates separately.\\nLet X_t be the x-coordinate after t steps. Each step, X_t changes by +1 with probability 1/2 (NE or SE) and -1 with probability 1/2 (NW or SW). So X_t is a simple symmetric random walk on Z_8. Similarly, Y_t is also a simple symmetric random walk on Z_8, independent of X_t because x-step and y-step signs are chosen independently (though correlated via the choice of diagonal, but their marginals are symmetric and the joint process is equivalent to taking independent ±1 steps in each coordinate with probability 1/4 for each combination).\\nMore concretely, the single-step increments for (X, Y) are:\\n (ΔX, ΔY) ∈ {(1,1), (−1,1), (1,−1), (−1,−1)}, each with probability 1/4.\\nThus ΔX is +1 with probability 1/2 (two of the four cases) and −1 with probability 1/2. Similarly for ΔY. The increments on X and Y are independent given this distribution, so the probability of being at (0,0) after t steps is\\n P(X_t = 0, Y_t = 0) = P(X_t = 0) · P(Y_t = 0) = P_1(t)^2,\\nwhere P_1(t) is the probability that a simple symmetric random walk on Z_8 starting at 0 is at 0 after t steps.\\nWe must compute P_1(2012).\\nRandom walk on cycle Z_8 with step ±1 with equal probability has transition matrix eigenvalues\\n λ_k = (e^{2πik/8} + e^{-2πik/8})/2 = cos(2πk/8) = cos(kπ/4),\\nfor k = 0, 1, ..., 7, with eigenvectors the Fourier modes. The probability to be at 0 after t steps, starting at 0, is\\n P_1(t) = (1/8) * Σ_{k=0}^{7} λ_k^t = (1/8) * Σ_{k=0}^{7} cos^t(kπ/4).\\nWe need t = 2012, an even number, which simplifies signs because cos(kπ/4) can be negative.\\nCompute the distinct eigenvalues:\\n k=0: cos(0) = 1.\\n k=1: cos(π/4) = √2/2.\\n k=2: cos(π/2) = 0.\\n k=3: cos(3π/4) = -√2/2.\\n k=4: cos(π) = -1.\\n k=5: cos(5π/4) = cos(π+π/4) = -√2/2.\\n k=6: cos(3π/2) = 0.\\n k=7: cos(7π/4) = √2/2.\\nGroup by value:\\n 1 occurs for k=0.\\n -1 occurs for k=4.\\n √2/2 occurs for k=1,7.\\n -√2/2 occurs for k=3,5.\\n 0 occurs for k=2,6.\\nFor even t, (−1)^t = 1; (−a)^t = a^t if t even; 0^t = 0 for t>0.\\nSo for t=2012 (even, >0):\\n λ_0^t = 1^t = 1.\\n λ_4^t = (−1)^t = 1.\\n λ_1^t = (√2/2)^{2012}.\\n λ_7^t = (√2/2)^{2012}.\\n λ_3^t = (−√2/2)^{2012} = (√2/2)^{2012}.\\n λ_5^t = (−√2/2)^{2012} = (√2/2)^{2012}.\\n λ_2^t = 0^{2012} = 0.\\n λ_6^t = 0^{2012} = 0.\\nThus the sum is\\n Σ_{k=0}^{7} λ_k^t = 1 (k=0) + 1 (k=4) + 4 * (√2/2)^{2012} + 2 * 0\\n = 2 + 4 * (√2/2)^{2012}.\\nSo\\n P_1(2012) = (1/8) * [2 + 4 * (√2/2)^{2012}] = (1/4) + (1/2) * (√2/2)^{2012}.\\nNow simplify (√2/2)^{2012}:\\n √2/2 = 1/√2.\\n So (1/√2)^{2012} = 2^{−2012/2} = 2^{−1006}.\\nTherefore\\n P_1(2012) = 1/4 + (1/2) * 2^{−1006} = 1/4 + 2^{−1007}.\\nNow the probability to be back at the original location (both coordinates 0) is\\n P = P_1(2012)^2 = (1/4 + 2^{−1007})^2.\\nExpand if desired:\\n (1/4 + 2^{−1007})^2 = 1/16 + 2 * (1/4)*2^{−1007} + (2^{−1007})^2\\n = 1/16 + 2^{−1006−1} + 2^{−2014}\\n = 1/16 + 2^{−1008} + 2^{−2014}.\\nBut the compact exact expression (1/4 + 2^{−1007})^2 is fine and exact.\\nThus, the probability is (1/4 + 2^{−1007})^2.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: 2012.\\nProblem 2: (1/4 + 2^{-1007})^2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2012\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"(1/4+2^-1007)^2\"\n}",
