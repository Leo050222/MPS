Let the face opposite A be triangle BCD, with side lengths a = CD, b = BD, c = BC. We are given the product a·b·c = 16.\\n\\nThe volume of a tetrahedron is V = (1/3)·(area of base)·(altitude). Choosing base BCD and altitude from A, we have\\nV = (1/3)·[BCD]·AX.\\nGiven V = 1, so\\n1 = (1/3)·[BCD]·AX  =>  AX = 3 / [BCD].\\nThus to find AX we just need the area of triangle BCD.\\n\\nWe are not directly given a, b, c individually, but we know AB = AC = AD = 2, so triangle ABD is isosceles with sides 2,2,b, triangle ACD has 2,2,a, and triangle ABC has 2,2,c.\\n\\nLet’s express the area of triangle ABC in terms of c: In triangle with sides 2,2,c, by Heron or formula for isosceles triangle:\\nArea^2 = s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c). But more directly, with equal sides 2,2 and base c, the altitude from A to BC is sqrt(2^2 - (c/2)^2) = sqrt(4 - c^2/4) = (1/2)·sqrt(16 - c^2). So\\n[ABC] = (1/2)·(base)·(height) = (1/2)·c·(1/2)·sqrt(16 - c^2) = (c/4)·sqrt(16 - c^2).\\nSimilarly,\\n[ABD] = (b/4)·sqrt(16 - b^2),\\n[ACD] = (a/4)·sqrt(16 - a^2).\\n\\nNow consider the area of the faces incident at A and the volume relation. More effective is to place A at origin and exploit coordinates and dot products.\\n\\nLet vectors AB = u, AC = v, AD = w, with |u| = |v| = |w| = 2. Then\\nV = (1/6)|det(u,v,w)| = 1 => |det(u,v,w)| = 6.\\nAlso, sides in face BCD are differences:\\nBC = |v - u| = c,\\nCD = |w - v| = a,\\nDB = |u - w| = b.\\n\\nCompute their squared lengths:\\n|v - u|^2 = |v|^2 + |u|^2 - 2u·v = 4 + 4 - 2u·v = 8 - 2u·v,\\nso c^2 = 8 - 2u·v, similarly\\nb^2 = 8 - 2u·w,\\na^2 = 8 - 2v·w.\\nDenote p = u·v, q = v·w, r = w·u. Then\\nc^2 = 8 - 2p,\\na^2 = 8 - 2q,\\nb^2 = 8 - 2r.\\n\\nThe volume squared via triple product: det(u,v,w)^2 = |u·(v×w)|^2 = 4^3 times determinant of Gram matrix /4^3 relation. More systematically, triple product squared equals determinant of Gram matrix G of (u,v,w):\\nG = [[u·u, u·v, u·w],\\n     [v·u, v·v, v·w],\\n     [w·u, w·v, w·w]] = [[4, p, r],[p,4,q],[r,q,4]].\\nThen det(G) = det(u,v,w)^2. Since |det(u,v,w)| = 6, we have det G = 36.\\n\\nCompute det G:\\n| 4   p   r |\\n| p   4   q |\\n| r   q   4 |.\\nWe expand:\\n4(16 - q^2) - p(4r - q p) + r(p q - 4r)\\n= 64 - 4q^2 -4pr + p^2 q + pqr - 4r^2\\n= 64 - 4(q^2 + pr + r^2) + pq(p + r).\\nSet equal to 36:\\n64 - 4(q^2 + pr + r^2) + pq(p + r) = 36,\\n=> 28 = 4(q^2 + pr + r^2) - pq(p + r).\\nThat is one relation among p,q,r.\\n\\nWe also have a·b·c = 16. Write a^2 = 8 - 2q, b^2 = 8 - 2r, c^2 = 8 - 2p. Then\\n(a b c)^2 = a^2 b^2 c^2 = 16^2 = 256.\\nSo\\n(8 - 2p)(8 - 2q)(8 - 2r) = 256.\\nFactor 2^3:\\n2^3(4 - p)(4 - q)(4 - r) = 256 => 8(4 - p)(4 - q)(4 - r) = 256 => (4 - p)(4 - q)(4 - r) = 32.\\nSo we have another relation.\\n\\nHowever, we ultimately need the area of triangle BCD. That depends only on vectors b1 = v - u and b2 = w - u (two edges in plane BCD from B to C and B to D). Note b1·b1 = c^2 = 8 - 2p, b2·b2 = b^2 = 8 - 2r, and b1·b2 = (v - u)·(w - u) = v·w - v·u - u·w + u·u = q - p - r + 4.\\nThen\\n[BCD]^2 = (1/4)|b1×b2|^2 = (1/4)(|b1|^2|b2|^2 - (b1·b2)^2).\\nGiven AX = 3/[BCD], we can equivalently find [BCD]^2 to deduce AX.\\n\\nBut we lack individual p,q,r; perhaps the conditions force a symmetric configuration. Tetrahedron ABCD has A equidistant from B,C,D, but no condition about the mutual edges between B,C,D except the product. However, there may be a value of [BCD] determined uniquely by volume and product constraint, without needing each side.\\n\\nLet us compute the squared distance from A to plane BCD via coordinates in terms of p,q,r and see if it simplifies with the product constraint.\\n\\nA is at origin; plane BCD has points u,v,w. The distance from origin to their plane is |det(u,v,w)| / |(v - u)×(w - u)|. This is standard: distance = 3V / area(BCD), and 3V = |det(u,v,w)|/2 ?? Actually V = (1/6)|det(u,v,w)|, and [BCD] = (1/2)| (v-u)×(w-u)|; we already used this to get AX = 3/[BCD]. But we can also write\\nAX^2 = (det(u,v,w)^2) / |(v-u)×(w-u)|^2.\\nBecause distance from origin to plane with basis b1,b2,b3 and normal n = b1×b2 is |u·n|/|n|, and |u·(v×w)| etc. But more clearly, if n is unit normal to plane BCD, signed distance from origin to plane is (u·n) (since plane eqn passes through u). But n is parallel to (v-u)×(w-u), and magnitude of u·n relates to det(u,v,w). In particular, det(u,v,w) = u·(v×w). Meanwhile (v-u)×(w-u) = v×w - u×w - v×u + u×u = v×w - u×w - v×u. Hard to simplify.\\n\\nInstead, we stick to AX = 3/[BCD]. The area [BCD] only depends on side lengths a,b,c of triangle BCD. From only product abc and volume, we might deduce [BCD]. Express volume in terms of edges from A and the opposite face edges.\\n\\nConsider tetrahedron with apex A: three faces incident to A have areas [ABC], [ABD], [ACD], and opposite face [BCD]. There is a formula linking these four face areas via the circumradius of the tetrahedron, but that may be overkill. Since the problem statement hints we need not find circumradius, only AX, maybe there is a simpler relation.\\n\\nHowever, we know each of [ABC], [ABD], [ACD] in terms of c,b,a respectively:\\n[ABC] = (c/4)·sqrt(16 - c^2), etc.\\nAlso, area of BCD can be expressed via Heron in terms of a,b,c:\\n[BCD]^2 = s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) with s = (a+b+c)/2.\\nStill, with only abc and some relation from volume, it might be solvable if there's a convenient parameterization.\\n\\nLet’s express volume in terms of a,b,c and the equal sides from A. Choose coordinates: Let BC, CD, DB known; connect A with equal length 2 to B,C,D. The volume can be computed from the height AX and base area [BCD] as we already did, giving only AX·[BCD] = 3. So we need one more relation linking a,b,c beyond abc=16.\\n\\nBut there is another relation from the equal distances AB=AC=AD: given a, b, c, the circumscribed sphere through B,C,D, and A being at distance 2 from each of B,C,D, there is a constraint. Yet the problem only gives product abc, neither sums nor squares. This suggests that maybe [BCD] itself is determined just from V and abc, without needing the detailed shape of triangle.\\n\\nIdea: express abc in terms of area [BCD] and circumradius R_BCD of triangle BCD: For any triangle, abc = 4R·[BCD], where R is circumradius of that triangle. Indeed, standard identity: a = 2R sin A, etc., and area = (1/2)bc sin A, leading to abc=4R·[area]. So for triangle BCD,\\nabc = 4R_Δ · [BCD].\\nWe know abc = 16, so 4R_Δ·[BCD] = 16 => R_Δ · [BCD] = 4.\\n\\nNext: the circumradius of tetrahedron’s circumsphere equals something involving R_Δ and AX. For a tetrahedron with one vertex A and opposite face BCD, and A is at distance h = AX from plane BCD, with circumcenter of face at distance d within the plane to projection of the sphere center, there is geometry relating the tetrahedron’s circumradius R (sphere containing A,B,C,D), the triangle face’s circumradius r = R_Δ, and h. In the configuration where the sphere center projects to the circumcenter of face BCD, we can derive simple relations.\\n\\nLet O be circumcenter of triangle BCD in its plane, and let R_Δ = |OB| = |OC| = |OD|. Let X be the foot of altitude from A to plane BCD. For the sphere that passes through B,C,D and A, its center must lie on the perpendicular to plane BCD through O (due to equal distances in that face if the sphere is symmetric relative to the face). Indeed, any sphere through three non-collinear points B,C,D has its center along the line perpendicular to their circumcircle’s plane through their circumcenter; so circumcenter of tetrahedron lies somewhere on line O + t·n (n normal to plane).\\n\\nLet S be the circumcenter of the tetrahedron (the center of sphere ω). Then SB = SC = SD = SA = R (the sphere’s radius). Let the signed distance from S to plane BCD be k. Then OB is horizontal radius R_Δ. So for point B, the distance SB^2 = R_Δ^2 + k^2. Same for C,D.\\nFor point A, with foot X, AX = h (the altitude). Let the projection of S to plane be O; then SX is vertical distance k, and horizontal distance XO is some value t. But note that the nearest point in plane BCD to A is X. We don’t know relation between O and X.\\n\\nHowever, the problem’s instructions claim we do NOT need the circumradius, but the natural relation abc = 4R_Δ[BCD] shows R_Δ appears. Another constraint: AB = AC = AD = 2, and distances from A to B,C,D are all equal and equal to distance 2 to the circumsphere points on the face triangle BCD. Maybe this implies that projection of A to plane is at fixed distance from O depending on R_Δ and 2.\\n\\nIndeed in triangle ABO within plane containing A and B and O (but O lies in plane BCD, A outside), we know OB = R_Δ, AB = 2, and angle at B depends on geometry. Without more info, this is not fixed. So more constraints must exist: we also incorporate volume V=1.\\n\\nBut easier method: use the identity abc = 4R_Δ[BCD], and altitude relation AX = 3/[BCD]. Then\\nabc = 4R_Δ·[BCD] = 4R_Δ·(3/AX) = 12R_Δ/AX.\\nGiven abc=16, we have 16 = 12R_Δ/AX => R_Δ = (16/12)·AX = (4/3)·AX.\\nThus R_Δ is proportional to AX. So the circumradius of face BCD equals (4/3) times the altitude from A.\\n\\nNext we use the fact that AB = AC = AD = 2. Let the circumcenter of triangle BCD be O with radius R_Δ. Let X be the foot of perpendicular from A to plane; so AX=h. Let r = R_Δ.\\nIn 3D, the distances from A to B,C,D are all 2. For instance, in triangle ABX, where B lies in plane and X is foot, we have right triangle with leg AX=h and base BX. So AB^2 = h^2 + BX^2 = 4, so BX^2 = 4 - h^2.\\nSimilarly, for C and D, CX^2 = DX^2 = 4 - h^2 (because AC=AD=2 and same altitude h). Hence B,C,D lie on circle in plane BCD centered at X with radius sqrt(4 - h^2).\\nThus, B,C,D are concyclic with center X, radius ρ = sqrt(4 - h^2).\\nBut any three non-collinear points have unique circumcircle, so this circle is the circumcircle of triangle BCD. Therefore its center X must coincide with O, and its radius R_Δ = ρ. So\\nR_Δ^2 = 4 - h^2.\\nBut we earlier found R_Δ = (4/3)h.\\nThus\\n(4/3 h)^2 = 4 - h^2 => (16/9)h^2 = 4 - h^2.\\nSolve:\\n(16/9)h^2 + h^2 = 4 => (25/9)h^2 = 4 => h^2 = 4·9/25 = 36/25.\\nSo h = AX = 6/5 (positive as an altitude length).\\n\\nWe are asked for δ = AX - 7/10. Compute δ:\\nAX = 6/5 = 1.2,\\n7/10 = 0.7,\\nδ = 6/5 - 7/10 = (12/10 - 7/10) = 5/10 = 1/2.\\nSo the answer for Problem 1 is δ = 1/2.\\n\\n(As a consistency check, we can also confirm [BCD] and product abc quickly: [BCD] = 3/AX = 3/(6/5) = (3·5)/6 = 5/2. Then R_Δ = (4/3)·(6/5) = 24/15 = 8/5. Then abc = 4R_Δ[BCD] = 4·(8/5)·(5/2) = 4·(8/2) = 16. This matches the given product.)\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have triangle ABC with A=(0,0), B=(200,100), C=(30,330). We must count integer pairs (x,y) such that the point P=(x+1/2, y+1/2) lies in the interior of triangle ABC.\\n\\nLet’s use the standard method of translating everything by vector (1/2,1/2) so that P is an integer point. Equivalently, count integer lattice points strictly inside the translated triangle A'B'C', where A' = A - (1/2,1/2) = (-1/2,-1/2), B'=(199.5,99.5), C'=(29.5,329.5). However, Pick’s theorem applies nicely to lattice polygons with integer vertices, so better is to leave the original triangle ABC (with integer vertices) and understand how interior half-integer points correspond to something like a half-scaled lattice.\\n\\nAn easier and fully rigorous method: A point (u,v) is inside triangle ABC if its barycentric coordinates relative to A,B,C are all positive. Equivalently, we can describe the interior region by inequalities derived from the three sides as linear inequalities.\\n\\nWe’ll express the condition directly for P=(x+1/2,y+1/2) with integer x,y.\\n\\n1) Find oriented edge lines and which side contains the interior.\\n\\nFirst compute equations of lines through edges AB, BC, CA.\\n\\nVector AB = (200,100). Line AB passes through origin with slope 100/200 = 1/2, so equation y = (1/2)x.\\nVector AC = (30,330). Slope = 330/30 = 11, so line AC: y = 11x.\\nVector BC: from B to C: C-B = (30-200,330-100)=(-170,230). Its slope is 230/(-170) = -23/17. Compute equation:\\nLine BC passes through B(200,100). Point-slope: y - 100 = (-23/17)(x - 200).\\nSimplify to standard form. Multiply by 17: 17(y - 100) = -23(x - 200) => 17y - 1700 = -23x + 4600 => 23x + 17y - 6300 = 0.\\nSo line BC: 23x + 17y = 6300.\\n\\nNow determine on which side of each line the interior lies. The triangle orientation: A(0,0), B(200,100), C(30,330). Compute twice signed area via determinant:\\n2Δ = x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B)\\n= 0*(100-330) + 200*(330-0) + 30*(0-100)\\n= 0 + 66000 - 3000 = 63000 >0.\\nSo this orientation A->B->C is counterclockwise; interior lies to the left of directed edges AB, BC, CA.\\n\\n• Edge AB: direction AB = (200,100). The left side is where cross(AB, P-A) > 0.\\nCross((200,100),(x,y)) = 200y - 100x. So interior requires 200y - 100x > 0 => divide by 100 => 2y - x > 0 => 2y > x.\\nEquation of line AB is y = x/2; check: interior above that line (since for C(30,330), 2*330 - 30 = 630 >0). So inequality 2y > x describes points above line AB.\\n\\n• Edge BC: direction BC = C-B = (-170,230). For point P, cross(BC, P-B) should be >0 for interior.\\nCompute cross(BC, P-B) symbolically: BC×(P-B) = (-170,230)×(x-200, y-100) = (-170)(y-100) - 230(x-200).\\nWe can rewrite using line equation. Note that line BC equation is 23x + 17y - 6300 =0. Let's compute more cleanly and simplify sign.\\nCompute: (-170)(y-100) - 230(x-200) = -170y + 17000 - 230x + 46000 = -(230x +170y -63000).\\nSo cross(BC,P-B) = -(230x +170y -63000).\\nThen cross>0 is equivalent to\\n-(230x +170y -63000) >0 => 230x +170y -63000 <0 => 23x +17y -6300 <0.\\nSo interior points satisfy 23x+17y <6300 (i.e., below the line BC if plot with x to right,y up).\\n\\nCheck with a known interior point like centroid G. Coordinates:\\nG = ( (0+200+30)/3 , (0+100+330)/3 ) = (230/3,430/3) ≈(76.67,143.33).\\nPlug into inequality 23x +17y:\\n23*(230/3)+17*(430/3) = (5290+7310)/3 = 12600/3 =4200 <6300, so inequality satisfied.\\nThus interior is indeed defined by 23x+17y<6300.\\n\\n• Edge CA: direction C-A = (30,330). For left-of inequality: cross(CA, P-A)>0 => (30,330)×(x,y) = 30y - 330x >0 => divide by 30 => y - 11x >0 => y >11x.\\nCheck B(200,100): 100>2200? false, so B lies on opposite side from interior, as expected.\\n\\nThus the interior of triangle ABC in standard Cartesian coordinates is:\\n1) 2y > x,\\n2) y > 11x,\\n3) 23x + 17y < 6300.\\n\\nNow we require P=(x+1/2,y+1/2) to satisfy these for integer x,y.\\nSubstitute into inequalities.\\n\\n1) 2(y+1/2) > (x+1/2) => 2y+1 > x+1/2 => 2y+1 -x -1/2 >0 => 2y - x + 1/2 >0.\\nRewrite as 4y - 2x +1 >0 => 4y - 2x +1 ≥1>0, but we need strict >0. Since 4y -2x is integer, 4y -2x +1 is also integer; for it to be >0 minimal is 1, so inequality is equivalent to\\n4y -2x +1 ≥ 1 => 4y -2x ≥ 0 => 2y - x ≥ 0.\\nBut we must verify that equality yields strict interior. Plugging equality 2y - x =0 back into original inequality: 2(y+1/2) > x+1/2 => 2y+1 > x+1/2. Using x=2y, we get 2y+1 > 2y +1/2 => 1>1/2 which holds. So equality 2y-x=0 is allowed; so inequality becomes 2y - x ≥ 0.\\nSo condition (1'): 2y ≥ x.\\n\\n2) y+1/2 > 11(x+1/2) => y+1/2 > 11x + 11/2 => y - 11x - 5 >0 (since 1/2 - 11/2 = -5). So inequality is y -11x -5 >0. Left side is integer, so minimal positive is 1. Thus equivalent to\\ny -11x -5 ≥ 1 => y ≥ 11x +6.\\nSo (2'): y ≥ 11x + 6.\\n\\n3) 23(x+1/2) +17(y+1/2) <6300 => 23x + 11.5 + 17y + 8.5 <6300 => 23x +17y +20 <6300 => 23x +17y < 6280.\\nThus (3'): 23x + 17y ≤ 6279? Wait, 23x+17y are integers; we need <6280, so maximum is 6279. So inequality is\\n23x +17y ≤ 6279.\\n\\nWe also observe triangle lies in region with x≥0,y≥0 since all vertices have nonnegative coordinates. But the interior inequalities already impose x,y constraints; still, note that for integer x satisfying 2y≥x and y≥11x+6 especially, x is forced to be small and nonnegative; y must be positive.\\n\\nSo we must count integer pairs (x,y) satisfying:\\n(i) 2y ≥ x,\\n(ii) y ≥ 11x + 6,\\n(iii) 23x + 17y ≤ 6279.\\n\\nWe will solve by bounding x, then y.\\n\\nFrom (ii), y ≥ 11x +6. From (i), y ≥ x/2 as well, but for any meaningful x, 11x+6 dominates x/2 when x≥0, and for negative x we should compare. Let's study both sign possibilities for x.\\n\\nFirst, (ii) and (iii) together give a bound on x:\\n23x + 17y ≤ 6279, with y ≥ 11x + 6 => substitute minimal y to get bound on x:\\n23x +17(11x+6) ≤ 6279 => 23x +187x +102 ≤6279 => 210x +102 ≤6279 => 210x ≤ 6177 => x ≤ 6177/210.\\nCompute 6177/210: 210*29 = 6090, remainder 87, 210*29.4=6174, 29.414... so x ≤29. So x is at most 29.\\n\\nFor lower bound on x, we must ensure there exists y satisfying (i),(ii),(iii). For a given x, the minimal y is max( (x+1)/2? Actually from (i) 2y≥x -> y≥x/2; y is integer so y ≥ ceil(x/2), and also y ≥ 11x+6. So overall y ≥ L(x) = max(ceil(x/2), 11x+6). The maximum of these is 11x+6 for reasonably large x; but for very negative x, x/2 may exceed 11x+6; let's check.\\nWe also derive from (iii): y ≤ U(x) = floor((6279 - 23x)/17).\\nFor solutions to exist, we need L(x) ≤ U(x).\\n\\nGiven slopes: 11 and 1/2 vs negative slope from (iii) in xy-plane; but simpler is examine plausible range of x: since 11x+6 must be not too large or 23x+17y will exceed bound.\\n\\nBound from (ii) + (iii) gave x ≤29. For lower bound, note from (ii) again, y≥11x+6; plug into (i): 2(11x+6) ≥ x => 22x+12≥x => 21x ≥ -12 => x ≥ -12/21 ≈ -0.571. So x ≥ -0.571. Since x is integer, x ≥0.\\nSo x ranges from 0 to 29 inclusive.\\nThus we no longer need to worry about negative x.\\n\\nNow for each integer x in [0,29], find integer y satisfying inequalities.\\nSince x≥0, check which lower bound dominates: y≥ 11x+6 vs y≥ ceil(x/2). For x≥0, 11x+6 ≥ x/2 holds for all x≥0:\\n11x+6 - x/2 = (22x+12 - x)/2 = (21x+12)/2 ≥12/2>0. So y≥11x+6 automatically implies 2y≥x. Therefore, for x≥0, condition (i) is redundant once (ii) holds. So L(x)=11x+6.\\n\\nUpper bound from (iii): y ≤ floor((6279-23x)/17).\\nFor each x, we need\\n11x +6 ≤ (6279 -23x)/17.\\nLet's solve inequality ignoring flooring to confirm x-range (we already used). Multiply out:\\n17(11x+6) ≤ 6279 -23x => 187x+102 ≤6279 -23x => 210x ≤6177 => x ≤29.414. So integer x are 0..29, as found.\\n\\nSo for each integer x from 0 to 29, the valid y are integers in [11x+6, floor((6279-23x)/17)]. Number of y-values is\\nN(x) = floor((6279-23x)/17) - (11x+6) +1, provided this is ≥0.\\nWe know it's ≥1 for 0..29 by construction.\\n\\nLet’s compute N(x) symbolically to avoid summing each manually. Define\\nU(x) = floor((6279-23x)/17).\\nFirst rewrite (6279-23x)/17:\\nWe can attempt to express it as 369 - (23x+...)/17, but let’s compute exact numerator: 6279 = 17*369 + 6 (since 17*370=6290, minus 17=6273; plus 6=6279), yes 17*369=6273. So\\n(6279-23x)/17 = 369 + (6 -23x)/17.\\nSo U(x) = 369 + floor((6 -23x)/17).\\nLet t(x) = 6 - 23x.\\nThus\\nN(x) = [369 + floor(t(x)/17)] - (11x+6) +1 = 364 -11x + floor(t(x)/17).\\nSpecifically,\\nN(x) = 364 - 11x + floor((6 -23x)/17).\\nWe'll compute floor((6-23x)/17) for x=0..29. But there may be a way to sum quickly via pattern.\\nLet’s tabulate t(x) = 6-23x and its division by 17.\\nNote 23 modulo 17 equals 6; this might help patterns.\\nCompute for x from 0 to 29:\\nWe can compute stepwise:\\nFor x=0: t=6, t/17 ≈0.352, floor=0.\\nEach increment in x decreases t by 23. Modulo 17, -23 ≡ -6 ≡11. But more simply we can compute t and floor quickly.\\n\\nI'll make a small table (x, t, floor(t/17)):\\n\\nx=0: t=6, floor=0.\\nx=1: t=6-23=-17, floor=-1.\\nx=2: t=-40, floor=-40/17≈-2.352, floor=-3.\\nx=3: t=-63, -63/17≈-3.705, floor=-4.\\nx=4: t=-86, ≈-5.058, floor=-6.\\nx=5: t=-109, ≈-6.412, floor=-7.\\nx=6: t=-132, ≈-7.764, floor=-8.\\nx=7: t=-155, ≈-9.117, floor=-10.\\nx=8: t=-178, ≈-10.470, floor=-11.\\nx=9: t=-201, ≈-11.823, floor=-12.\\nx=10: t=-224, ≈-13.176, floor=-14.\\nx=11: t=-247, ≈-14.529, floor=-15.\\nx=12: t=-270, ≈-15.882, floor=-16.\\nx=13: t=-293, ≈-17.235, floor=-18.\\nx=14: t=-316, ≈-18.588, floor=-19.\\nx=15: t=-339, ≈-19.941, floor=-20.\\nx=16: t=-362, ≈-21.294, floor=-22.\\nx=17: t=-385, ≈-22.647, floor=-23.\\nx=18: t=-408, ≈-24.000, floor=-24 exactly? Check 17*24=408, so -408/17 = -24 exactly, floor=-24.\\nx=19: t=-431, ≈-25.352, floor=-26.\\nx=20: t=-454, ≈-26.705, floor=-27.\\nx=21: t=-477, ≈-28.058, floor=-29.\\nx=22: t=-500, ≈-29.411, floor=-30.\\nx=23: t=-523, ≈-30.764, floor=-31.\\nx=24: t=-546, ≈-32.117, floor=-33.\\nx=25: t=-569, ≈-33.470, floor=-34.\\nx=26: t=-592, ≈-34.823, floor=-35.\\nx=27: t=-615, ≈-36.176, floor=-37.\\nx=28: t=-638, ≈-37.529, floor=-38.\\nx=29: t=-661, ≈-38.882, floor=-39.\\n\\nWe should double-check some floors due to these irregular jumps. Because every time t decreases by 23, t/17 decreases by 23/17≈1.3529, so floor goes down by either 1 or 2 units typically. Let’s recompute more carefully with integer division: floor(t/17) = -ceil(|t|/17) when t<0.\\nWe can compute |t|/17 exactly using integer division.\\n\\nFor clarity, compute with |t| and multiples of 17:\\n17*k values: 17,34,51,68,85,102,119,136,153,170,187,204,221,238,255,272,289,306,323,340,357,374,391,408,425,442,459,476,493,510,527,544,561,578,595,612,629,646,663,\\nWe need up to 661.\\n\\nNow do t negative cases systematically:\\nFor negative t, floor(t/17) = -(ceil(|t|/17)). So we find ceil(|t|/17) as smallest k with 17k ≥ |t|.\\nWe'll recompute entries x>=1.\\n\\nx=1: t=-17, |t|=17, ceil(17/17)=1, floor=-1.
