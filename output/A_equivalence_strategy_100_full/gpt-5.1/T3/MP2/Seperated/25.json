The region R is the subset of the unit square where both coordinates of T(x, y) are ≤ 1:\\n1) 3x + 2y ≤ 1\\n2) x + 4y ≤ 1\\n3) 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1\\nWe find the polygon R inside the first quadrant bounded by these inequalities.\\n\\nFirst find intercepts and intersection lines:\\n- From 3x + 2y ≤ 1:\\n  * If y = 0, then 3x ≤ 1 ⇒ x ≤ 1/3\\n  * If x = 0, then 2y ≤ 1 ⇒ y ≤ 1/2\\n- From x + 4y ≤ 1:\\n  * If y = 0, then x ≤ 1\\n  * If x = 0, then 4y ≤ 1 ⇒ y ≤ 1/4\\n\\nIntersection of the two lines:\\nSolve 3x + 2y = 1 and x + 4y = 1.\\nFrom x + 4y = 1 ⇒ x = 1 − 4y.\\nSubstitute into 3x + 2y = 1:\\n3(1 − 4y) + 2y = 1 ⇒ 3 − 12y + 2y = 1 ⇒ 3 − 10y = 1 ⇒ 10y = 2 ⇒ y = 1/5.\\nThen x = 1 − 4(1/5) = 1 − 4/5 = 1/5.\\nSo the intersection point of the two boundary lines is (1/5, 1/5).\\n\\nNow determine the region R in the first quadrant with both inequalities and the unit square constraints. Check each inequality at (0,0) to determine which side is kept:\\n- At (0,0): 3(0) + 2(0) = 0 ≤ 1 and 0 + 4(0) = 0 ≤ 1, so (0,0) is included; the region is the part of the plane on the origin side of both lines.\\nThus, within 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, R is the convex polygon with vertices formed by intersecting these half-planes with the axes.\\n\\nFind the polygon vertices in order around the region:\\n- Start at O = (0,0).\\n- Along x-axis (y = 0):\\n  * 3x + 2(0) ≤ 1 ⇒ x ≤ 1/3.\\n  * x + 4(0) ≤ 1 ⇒ x ≤ 1.\\n  So the binding constraint on the x-axis is x ≤ 1/3 from the first inequality. Thus the point on the x-axis in R furthest from the origin is A = (1/3, 0).\\n\\n- Along y-axis (x = 0):\\n  * 3(0) + 2y ≤ 1 ⇒ y ≤ 1/2.\\n  * 0 + 4y ≤ 1 ⇒ y ≤ 1/4.\\n  So the binding constraint on the y-axis is y ≤ 1/4 from the second inequality. Thus the point on the y-axis in R furthest from the origin is B = (0, 1/4).\\n\\nNow check which boundary lines connect A and B.\\nAt A = (1/3,0):\\n- 3x + 2y = 3*(1/3) + 0 = 1 ⇒ A lies on 3x + 2y = 1.\\n- x + 4y = 1/3 ≤ 1 ⇒ inside the second inequality, not on it.\\nAt B = (0,1/4):\\n- 3x + 2y = 2*(1/4) = 1/2 ≤ 1.\\n- x + 4y = 4*(1/4) = 1 ⇒ B lies on x + 4y = 1.\\n\\nThe intersection of the two lines is C = (1/5, 1/5), already found, and this point clearly lies inside the unit square.\\nThe region R as intersection of the half-planes is the quadrilateral with vertices (in order):\\n(0,0) → (1/3,0) → (1/5,1/5) → (0,1/4) → back to (0,0).\\nWe can verify that the segment from A to C lies on the line 3x+2y=1 and from C to B lies on x+4y=1, and that everything is in the first quadrant.\\n\\nNow compute area(R). Since R is a convex quadrilateral, use the shoelace formula.\\nList points in counterclockwise order:\\nP1 = (0,0)\\nP2 = (1/3,0)\\nP3 = (1/5,1/5)\\nP4 = (0,1/4)\\nBack to P1.\\nShoelace sum:\\nSum1 = x1*y2 + x2*y3 + x3*y4 + x4*y1\\n     = 0*0 + (1/3)*(1/5) + (1/5)*(1/4) + 0*0\\n     = 1/15 + 1/20\\n     = (4/60 + 3/60) = 7/60.\\nSum2 = y1*x2 + y2*x3 + y3*x4 + y4*x1\\n     = 0*(1/3) + 0*(1/5) + (1/5)*0 + (1/4)*0\\n     = 0.\\nArea = (1/2)*|Sum1 − Sum2| = (1/2)*(7/60) = 7/120.\\nHence area(R) = 7/120.\\n\\nThe problem asks not to re-derive the original fraction a/b for the probability, but instead to compute\\nk = area(R) + 1553/120.\\nWe found area(R) = 7/120.\\nThus k = 7/120 + 1553/120 = (7 + 1553)/120 = 1560/120 = 13.\\nSo the answer for Problem 1 is 13.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe are told:\\n- A standard 52-card deck, 4 suits.\\n- High cards (honors): A, K, Q, J. There are 4 of each rank across the deck, so 16 honor cards total.\\n- Points: 4 per A, 3 per K, 2 per Q, 1 per J.\\n- We consider a specific 13-card hand.\\n- Given that this hand has exactly 4 cards that are among {A, K, Q, J}, i.e., exactly 4 honor cards.\\nWe want: P( hand has point value ≥ 13 | hand has exactly 4 honors ).\\n\\nGiven exactly 4 honor cards, the remaining 9 cards are non-honors and contribute 0 points. So the total point value is determined entirely by the multiset of ranks of these 4 honor cards. Let (a, k, q, j) be the counts of A, K, Q, J respectively among these 4 honors. Then:\\n- a + k + q + j = 4.\\n- Point value P = 4a + 3k + 2q + 1j.\\nWe need P ≥ 13.\\nMoreover, the four honors in the hand are sampled uniformly from the 16 honors, subject to there being 4 of each rank and 4 suits for each rank. Because suits are symmetric and the hand is otherwise random, the distribution of (a,k,q,j) is the same as drawing 4 cards without replacement from a “mini-deck” of 16 cards with 4 of each rank.\\nThus, in the conditional probability given exactly 4 honors, each specific 4-card subset of the 16 honors is equally likely. Therefore, the probability that the honor ranks yield P ≥ 13 is:\\n(number of 4-card honor subsets with P ≥ 13) / (total number of 4-card honor subsets).\\nThe 9 non-honor cards just fill out the hand and do not affect the points.\\n\\nAlternatively, more formally: Let H be the event “hand has exactly 4 honors”. Let E be the event “hand has at least 13 points”. Then\\nP(E | H) = (# 13-card hands with exactly 4 honors and ≥ 13 points)/ (# 13-card hands with exactly 4 honors).\\nBut each such hand has:\\n- Choose positions for the 4 honors in the 13-card set: C(13,4) ways.\\n- Choose the specific 4 honors from the 16 honor cards: C(16,4) ways.\\n- Choose the other 9 from the 36 non-honors: C(36,9) ways.\\nWithin the numerator, we only restrict the choice of which 4 honor cards we picked; the positions and the 9 non-honors are the same combinatorial factors C(13,4)*C(36,9) for all cases. Thus\\nP(E|H) = ( (# choices of 4 honor cards from the 16 with total ≥ 13 points) ) / C(16,4).\\nSo we only need to analyze the 4-card subsets of the 16 honors by rank and not by suit: each rank A/K/Q/J has 4 identical cards in terms of point value, so we count combinations by how many of each rank we pick, and multiply by the ways to choose suits for those cards.\\n\\nTotal number of 4-card honor subsets (from 16 honor cards): C(16,4).\\nWe classify by the counts (a, k, q, j) with a+k+q+j = 4, and for each composition we count how many distinct 4-card subsets of the 16 cards correspond to that composition.\\nEach rank r ∈ {A,K,Q,J} has 4 suit variants (one per suit). If we choose r_r cards of rank r, the number of ways to choose them by suit is C(4, r_r). Thus for a composition (a,k,q,j) with total 4, the number of card subsets is C(4,a)*C(4,k)*C(4,q)*C(4,j).\\nWe must consider all compositions with point total P = 4a + 3k + 2q + 1j ≥ 13.\\nBecause a+k+q+j = 4, and j = 4 − a − k − q, we can reduce P:\\nP = 4a + 3k + 2q + (4 − a − k − q)\\n  = 4a + 3k + 2q + 4 − a − k − q\\n  = (4a − a) + (3k − k) + (2q − q) + 4\\n  = 3a + 2k + q + 4.\\nCondition P ≥ 13 ⇒ 3a + 2k + q + 4 ≥ 13 ⇒ 3a + 2k + q ≥ 9.\\nWe must also have nonnegative integer a, k, q, j with sum 4.\\nWe can systematically list allowed compositions.\\n\\nWe have 3a + 2k + q ≥ 9 and a + k + q + j = 4, j ≥ 0.\\nSince j = 4 − a − k − q, j ≥ 0 implies a + k + q ≤ 4.\\nBecause 3a + 2k + q is nonnegative and the maximum possible when a+k+q=4 is when we put as many as possible into a (coefficient 3), then k (coefficient 2), then q (coefficient 1). Max is 3*4 = 12. So 3a+2k+q ranges up to 12.\\nWe look for integer (a,k,q) with a+k+q ≤ 4 and 3a+2k+q ≥ 9.\\nIt’s easier to list all partitions of 4 among (a,k,q,j) and check 3a+2k+q ≥ 9.\\nAll compositions of 4 into 4 nonnegative integers (a,k,q,j) are the integer solutions with sum 4.\\nWe can classify by a first.\\n\\nCase a = 4:\\nThen k = q = j = 0. Check 3a + 2k + q = 3*4 + 0 + 0 = 12 ≥ 9. Valid.\\nPoint total is P = 4*4 = 16.\\n\\nCase a = 3:\\nThen k + q + j = 1.\\nPossibilities:\\n- (a,k,q,j) = (3,1,0,0)\\n- (3,0,1,0)\\n- (3,0,0,1)\\nCompute 3a + 2k + q:\\n- (3,1,0,0): 3*3 + 2*1 + 0 = 9 + 2 = 11 ≥ 9, valid.\\n- (3,0,1,0): 9 + 0 + 1 = 10 ≥ 9, valid.\\n- (3,0,0,1): 9 + 0 + 0 = 9 ≥ 9, valid.\\nAll with a=3 are valid.\\n\\nCase a = 2:\\nThen k + q + j = 2.\\nList possibilities for (k,q,j) with sum 2.\\nThey are:\\n- (2,0,0): (a,k,q,j) = (2,2,0,0)\\n- (1,1,0): (2,1,1,0)\\n- (1,0,1): (2,1,0,1)\\n- (0,2,0): (2,0,2,0)\\n- (0,1,1): (2,0,1,1)\\n- (0,0,2): (2,0,0,2).\\nCompute 3a + 2k + q = 3*2 + 2k + q = 6 + 2k + q.\\nWe need 6 + 2k + q ≥ 9 ⇒ 2k + q ≥ 3.\\nCheck each:\\n- (2,2,0,0): 2k + q = 2*2 + 0 = 4 ≥ 3 ⇒ valid.\\n- (2,1,1,0): 2k + q = 2*1 + 1 = 3 ⇒ valid.\\n- (2,1,0,1): 2*1 + 0 = 2 < 3 ⇒ not valid.\\n- (2,0,2,0): 2*0 + 2 = 2 < 3 ⇒ not valid.\\n- (2,0,1,1): 2*0 + 1 = 1 < 3 ⇒ not valid.\\n- (2,0,0,2): 2*0 + 0 = 0 < 3 ⇒ not valid.\\nSo for a=2, only compositions (2,2,0,0) and (2,1,1,0) work.\\n\\nCase a = 1:\\nThen k + q + j = 3.\\nList possibilities for (k,q,j) with sum 3:\\n(k,q,j) = (3,0,0), (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (1,1,1), (1,0,2), (0,3,0), (0,2,1), (0,1,2), (0,0,3).\\nCompute 3a + 2k + q = 3*1 + 2k + q = 3 + 2k + q.\\nNeed 3 + 2k + q ≥ 9 ⇒ 2k + q ≥ 6.\\nCheck each:\\n- (1,3,0,0): a=1,k=3,q=0,j=0: 2k + q = 2*3 + 0 = 6 ⇒ valid.\\n- (1,2,1,0): 2k + q = 2*2 + 1 = 5 < 6 ⇒ not valid.\\n- (1,2,0,1): 2*2 + 0 = 4 < 6 ⇒ not valid.\\n- (1,1,2,0): 2*1 + 2 = 4 < 6 ⇒ not valid.\\n- (1,1,1,1): 2*1 + 1 = 3 < 6 ⇒ not valid.\\n- (1,1,0,2): 2*1 + 0 = 2 < 6 ⇒ not valid.\\n- (1,0,3,0): 2*0 + 3 = 3 < 6 ⇒ not valid.\\n- (1,0,2,1): 2*0 + 2 = 2 < 6 ⇒ not valid.\\n- (1,0,1,2): 2*0 + 1 = 1 < 6 ⇒ not valid.\\n- (1,0,0,3): 2*0 + 0 = 0 < 6 ⇒ not valid.\\nSo for a=1, only composition (1,3,0,0) works.\\n\\nCase a = 0:\\nThen k + q + j = 4.\\nNow 3a + 2k + q = 0 + 2k + q; need 2k + q ≥ 9. But since k+q+j = 4, maxima: we can put all into k, so k=4,q=0 gives 2k+q=8; or k=3,q=1 gives 2*3+1=7, etc. The maximum is 8 < 9, so no compositions with a=0 satisfy 2k+q ≥ 9. Thus none valid.\\n\\nSo all valid compositions (a,k,q,j) are:\\n1) (4,0,0,0)\\n2) (3,1,0,0)\\n3) (3,0,1,0)\\n4) (3,0,0,1)\\n5) (2,2,0,0)\\n6) (2,1,1,0)\\n7) (1,3,0,0)\\nWe can also compute the point values as a check:\\n1) 4 Aces: 4*4 = 16\\n2) 3 Aces + 1 King: 3*4 + 3 = 15\\n3) 3 Aces + 1 Queen: 12 + 2 = 14\\n4) 3 Aces + 1 Jack: 12 + 1 = 13\\n5) 2 Aces + 2 Kings: 8 + 6 = 14\\n6) 2 Aces + 1 King + 1 Queen: 8 + 3 + 2 = 13\\n7) 1 Ace + 3 Kings: 4 + 9 = 13\\nAll ≥ 13, as required.\\n\\nNow count the number of 4-card subsets from the 16 honor cards for each composition. For each rank r we have C(4, count_of_rank) choices.\\n1) (4,0,0,0): 4 Aces.\\n   Ways = C(4,4)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)*C(4,0) = 1.\\n\\n2) (3,1,0,0): 3 Aces, 1 King.\\n   Ways = C(4,3)*C(4,1)*C(4,0)*C(4,0) = 4*4 = 16.\\n\\n3) (3,0,1,0): 3 Aces, 1 Queen.\\n   Ways = C(4,3)*C(4,0)*C(4,1)*C(4,0) = 4*4 = 16.\\n\\n4) (3,0,0,1): 3 Aces, 1 Jack.\\n   Ways = C(4,3)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)*C(4,1) = 4*4 = 16.\\n\\n5) (2,2,0,0): 2 Aces, 2 Kings.\\n   Ways = C(4,2)*C(4,2)*C(4,0)*C(4,0) = 6*6 = 36.\\n\\n6) (2,1,1,0): 2 Aces, 1 King, 1 Queen.\\n   Ways = C(4,2)*C(4,1)*C(4,1)*C(4,0) = 6*4*4 = 96.\\n\\n7) (1,3,0,0): 1 Ace, 3 Kings.\\n   Ways = C(4,1)*C(4,3)*C(4,0)*C(4,0) = 4*4 = 16.\\n\\nNow sum the favorable subsets:\\nTotal_favorable = 1 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 36 + 96 + 16.\\nCompute stepwise: 1 + 16 = 17; 17+16 = 33; 33+16 = 49; 49+36 = 85; 85+96 = 181; 181+16 = 197.\\nSo there are 197 favorable 4-card honor subsets.\\n\\nTotal number of 4-card subsets from the 16 honor cards is C(16,4).\\nCompute C(16,4):\\nC(16,4) = 16*15*14*13 / (4*3*2*1).\\nFirst 4*3*2*1 = 24.\\nNumerator: 16*15 = 240; 14*13 = 182; 240*182 = 240*(200−18) = 48000 − 4320 = 43680.\\nThen 43680 / 24.\\nDivide: 43680 / 8 = 5460; then 5460 / 3 = 1820. So C(16,4) = 1820.\\n\\nThus, the desired conditional probability is:\\nP = 197 / 1820.\\nWe should check if this fraction simplifies.\\nCompute gcd(197, 1820). 197 is prime (not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11,13). Check divisibility: 1820 /197 ≈ 9.23, so not integer. Try 197*9 = 1773; remainder 47; not zero. So gcd is 1. So 197/1820 is already in lowest terms.\\nHence, the answer for Problem 2 is 197/1820.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\n- Problem 1: 13.\\n- Problem 2: 197/1820.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"13\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"197/1820\"\n}",
