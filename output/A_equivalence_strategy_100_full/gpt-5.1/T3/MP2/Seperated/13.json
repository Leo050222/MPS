  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Evaluating digit constraints for squares**\n\nI'm looking at numbers with thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones digits ranging from 0-5, specifically between 1000 and 5999. I need to find perfect squares within this range, with a focus on digits not exceeding 5. I'll calculate squares from 32 to 77 and filter for those that match. Some numbers check out, like 32², which is 1024. However, others, like 33² and 34², don't meet the digit requirements, while 38² does. I'll keep narrowing down my options!**Analyzing squares and polynomial remainders**\n\nOkay, I've checked squares for 39 to 45, finding that 39^2 = 1521 and 45^2 = 2025 fit the digit criteria. That leads me to n' being 2632, where I found that 56^2 = 3136 is valid. For Problem 2, I need to find a polynomial remainder when dividing by (x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6). I've set up equations through interpolation and solved for coefficients, ultimately finding that R(x) = x² - 5. That gives me my second answer!**Creating a JSON response**\n\nI need to summarize my reasoning without getting into the sensitive step-by-step details. The goal is to create a short explanation like: \"I found the only 4-digit square with digits less than 6 whose digit transformation is also a square, resulting in a = 45 and m = 3.\" For the polynomial, the unique degree-2 polynomial matches the given remainders, leading to x² - 5. I’ll format all this into a JSON block as required and ensure it's valid before sending. Let's do this!**Ensuring valid JSON format**\n\nI realized that the example had a trailing comma, which is actually invalid for JSON. But the instructions clearly state that I need to provide valid JSON. Therefore, I need to make sure there's no trailing comma in my final output. I'll structure it like this:\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"...\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"x^2-5\"\n}\n\nAlright, that's a clear and valid format!</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I listed 4-digit perfect squares whose digits are all less than 6, then checked whether adding 1 to each digit yielded another perfect square. The only number that works is 2025 (45^2); increasing each digit by 1 gives 3136, which is 56^2. Thus a = 45, so m = a - 42 = 3.\\n\\nFor Problem 2, the divisor x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 factors as (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3). The remainder upon division by this cubic must be a quadratic R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c that matches the given remainders at x = 1, 2, 3: R(1) = -4, R(2) = -1, R(3) = 4. Solving this system for a, b, c gives R(x) = x^2 - 5.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"x^2-5\"\n}",
