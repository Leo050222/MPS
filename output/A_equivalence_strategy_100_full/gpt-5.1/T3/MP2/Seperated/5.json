      "A1054": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $e = N - 86$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen."

  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing expected suffering**\n\nI’m considering a scenario with 256 students, each one having a unique blood type linked to distinct antigen subsets. This means every possible subset is represented. Quito randomly picks students to bite, storing their antigens over time. Each bite introduces a foreign antigen based on what Quito already carries, resulting in a certain hours of suffering for each student, denoted by \"k.\" Instead of calculating the total suffering, I’m supposed to find e = N - 86, where N is the number of students with a specific antigen.**Calculating expected suffering**\n\nIt looks like I’ve derived an expression for expected suffering, depending solely on N. To find e, I calculate e = N - 86, where N represents the number of students with a specific antigen. Since all 256 subsets exist, and half of those subsets contain that antigen, N equals 2^7, which is 128. Thus, e becomes 128 - 86, resulting in 42. This seems deliberately simple to avoid complex calculations. Now, moving to problem 2, we've got three integers a, b, and c.**Finding the sum of integers**\n\nI’m analyzing three potential outcomes from averaging values. The results can be represented as:  \n1) The average of b and c plus a equals one of the numbers: 42, 13, or 37.  \n2) The average of a and c plus b equals another, and  \n3) The average of a and b plus c equals the last.\n\nI defined X, Y, and Z for these sums, and after simplifying, I derived their relationships. By doubling these expressions and summing them up, I found that a + b + c equals 46, regardless of the specific assignments.**Exploring relationships**\n\nI see that I have the equations: 2X = 2a + b + c and am realizing I can express 2X as S + a, where S is the sum a + b + c, and S = 46. So, I can rearrange to find a, b, and c in terms of that sum.\n\nNow I have: a = 2X - 46, b = 2Y - 46, and c = 2Z - 46. This means the multiset {a, b, c} can be represented as {2r - 46 | r in {42, 13, 37}}. However, the specific mapping can vary, even though the multiset remains consistent! I'll double-check to ensure the mappings are clear!**Finalizing reasoning and answers**\n\nI’ve solidified my understanding of the problem. The expressions I derived show that the final results of averaging the integers correspond to values like 42, 13, and 37 in some permutation. After finding the values for a, b, and c, I determined they are 38, -20, and 28. The order isn’t crucial, so I’ll format the answer as \"38, 28, -20\" for clarity. I also need to create a reasoning string summarizing key steps without getting too verbose. Lastly, I'll ensure there's no trailing comma in the final JSON structure.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: There are 8 antigens and 256 students, each corresponding to a distinct subset of the 8-antigen set, so all 2^8 subsets occur exactly once. For any fixed antigen, exactly half of all subsets contain it, so N = 2^7 = 128 students have that antigen. Therefore e = N - 86 = 128 - 86 = 42. Problem 2: Let the integers be a, b, c. The three possible results are (b + c)/2 + a, (a + c)/2 + b, and (a + b)/2 + c, which in some order equal 42, 13, and 37. Writing these as (2a + b + c)/2, (a + 2b + c)/2, (a + b + 2c)/2 and summing shows a + b + c = (42 + 13 + 37)/2 = 46. Each doubled expression equals 46 plus the corresponding integer, so the three integers are 2*42 - 46, 2*13 - 46, and 2*37 - 46, giving the set {38, 28, -20}.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"42\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"38, 28, -20\"\n}",
