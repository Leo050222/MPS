  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing derivatives and limits**\n\nI need to compute the derivative, but it seems like it might blow up to infinity near 0 or 1. Checking, as r approaches 0, the function tends toward infinity. A similar situation occurs when r approaches 1 from the left. It looks like there's no global maximum since the function tends to infinity at these endpoints, potentially relating to skewed triangles. I'm considering values for n and m as positive integers, but it seems constraints might emerge with the integer requirement for T when testing specific values.**Deriving T and analyzing conditions**\n\nI need to compute \\( T = \\frac{4m(m+1)}{m-1} \\). After performing polynomial division, I find that \\( \\frac{m^2+m}{m-1} \\) simplifies to \\( m+2 + \\frac{2}{m-1} \\). By multiplying, I see \\( T = 4m + 8 + \\frac{8}{m-1} \\). Since \\( m \\) is even and at least 2, \\( T \\) approaches \\( 4m + 8 \\) as \\( m \\) increases, which grows unbounded. However, I need to consider constraints on side lengths being pairwise coprime, particularly for a primitive triple.**Examining parameters and coprimeness**\n\nI’m realizing that if some divisor greater than 1 divides both A and B, it could break the primitiveness of the triangle. A, B, and C are legs, with pairwise coprimeness among them. Even so, we might have infinitely even m values while keeping n at 1. I wonder if they want the three sides to be relatively prime together, which matches a primitive triple. I need to double-check my earlier algebra on the perimeter and area calculations to ensure I’ve got the parameterization right.**Testing integer conditions for T**\n\nWhen \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( m \\) is even, I calculated \\( T = \\frac{4m(m+1)}{m-1} \\). I want to test this against actual numeric triples, starting with \\( m = 2 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\), which gives the (3, 4, 5) triangle. Here, \\( P \\) is 12, and \\( A \\) is 6, making \\( \\frac{P^2}{A} = 24 \\) and matching \\( T \\). However, for \\( m = 4 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\), it gets tricky as the ratio isn't an integer anymore. I realize I need to focus on integer conditions and maximizing \\( T \\) by considering only those primitive triples that maintain the integer ratio.**Exploring T's constraints and cases**\n\nI want to explore the equation \\( T = \\frac{4m(m+n)}{n(m-n)} \\) and verify it through examples. For \\( n=1 \\), I discover \\( T \\) will not be an integer for certain \\( m \\), particularly when \\( m=4 \\). I observe that the requirement for \\( T \\) to be integral limits \\( n \\) to values like 1, 2, and 4. Evaluating each case leads to the discovery of potential triples and helps pinpoint the largest possible value of \\( T \\), which I've found to be 45. Now, I need to summarize this in a JSON format.**Formatting reasoning for JSON**\n\nI need to prepare reasoning for a JSON output while keeping it concise. For Problem 1, I observed the formula \\( E = \\frac{P(10) + P(-10)}{2} \\) and worked in base 100 to derive coefficients leading to \\( k = 2 \\). In Problem 2, I parameterized primitive right triangles using \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), derived the formula and enforced integrality conditions, finding that the largest integer value is 45. I’ll ensure the reasoning is one string and valid for JSON.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Write P(10)=E+O and P(-10)=E−O, where E is the sum of even-power terms and O the sum of odd-power terms evaluated at 10. Then E=(331633+273373)/2=302503 and O=(331633−273373)/2=29130. Interpret E as a base-100 number: 302503 = 3 + 25·100 + 30·100², so a0=3, a2=25, a4=30. Since O=10·B, we get B=2913, and 2913 = 13 + 29·100, so a1=13, a3=29. Thus k=a3−27=29−27=2. Problem 2: For a primitive right triangle, parameterize sides as (m²−n², 2mn, m²+n²) with gcd(m,n)=1 and opposite parity. Then P=2m(m+n), A=mn(m²−n²), so P²/A = 4m(m+n)/(n(m−n)). For this to be an integer, n(m−n) must divide 4m(m+n). Using gcd(m,n)=1 and gcd(m−n,n)=1, we deduce n|4, so n∈{1,2,4}. Checking each case with the coprimality and parity conditions: n=1 gives m=2 and ratio 24; n=2 gives m=3 and ratio 30; n=4 gives m=5 and ratio 45. Hence the largest possible integer value is 45.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"45\"\n}",
