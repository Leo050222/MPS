  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Solving the integer equations**\n\nI'm working on the equations x = ab + 1, y = bc + 1, z = ca + 1, with xyz = 84. I think I'll solve this systematically using small values because 84 isn't too large. First, I'll check if any variable can be zero. If a = 0, then x and z both equal 1, leading to bc + 1 = 84, which means bc = 83. So, the pairs (b,c) are (1,83) or (83,1). I'll explore similar cases for b = 0 and c = 0 next.**Exploring zero cases and solutions**\n\nNow, I'm considering the case where there are two zeros. If a = 0 and b = 0, then ab = 0, bc = 0, and ca = 0, leading to a product of 1, which isn't equal to 84. So this scenario can't happen. With at least one zero, I've found six distinct solutions: (0,1,83), (0,83,1), (83,0,1), (1,0,83), (1,83,0), and (83,1,0). \n\nNext, in case two variables are positive, I realize that all values must be greater than or equal to one, so I'll analyze the positive integer solutions to ab, bc, and ca.**Structuring the integer problem**\n\nI'm considering how to approach the integers a, b, and c, knowing they must be positive. This means ab, bc, and ca are all greater than zero. I’ll look into permutations of the triples (x, y, z) and try to solve the system for each combination. \n\nIt’s interesting to note that the relationship (ab)(bc)(ca) = (abc)² connects the equations. Since 84 is relatively small, I should be able to find small solutions by examining the factor triples and their permutations. I think focusing on unique unordered triples will help narrow things down without redundancy.**Exploring factor triples**\n\nI'm starting by selecting a factor triple (x,y,z) = (2,2,21) as a reference for my variables. The mapping from (x,y,z) to (ab+1, bc+1, ca+1) can be permuted, but using symmetry helps simplify this process. \n\nI realize that any solution's factor triple is determined by how we permute the variables. Since ab + 1 is at least 2, I know ab must be between 1 and 83. I’m thinking about logically enumerating feasible solutions, and I might even consider the case where a = b = c, which leads me to the condition (a^2 + 1)³ = 84.**Finding solutions and verifying counts**\n\nI'm breaking down the problem by examining various cases, particularly with 84 not being a cube. \n\nWhen considering if any combinations of ab, bc, or ca equal 1, I noticed the factors are small. If ab = 1, it leads to contradictions when I calculate the potential products. I've determined that no factor can equal 2, limiting the possibilities to permutations of (3, 4, 7). \n\nAfter analyzing potential combinations of integers, I found that there are exactly six ordered triples of (1, 2, 3) resulting in valid solutions, concluding there are 12 total solutions, counting configurations with zeros.**Summarizing reasoning for problems**\n\nI need to provide a concise overview of my reasoning rather than a detailed step-by-step explanation. For Problem 1, I focused on subsets with a maximum of 5 and used inclusion-exclusion for the 10-sum subsets. For Problem 2, I analyzed the factorization of 84 and solved a small system, which yielded permutations of (1, 2, 3) as well as six additional cases involving a zero. \n\nNow, I’ll format my answers as strings without any trailing commas for valid JSON output:\n```json\n{\n \"reasoning\": \"...\",\n \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}\n```</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Focus only on subsets S of {1,2,3,4,5} with largest element 5, so 5 must be in S and the other elements come from {1,2,3,4}. There are 2^4 = 16 such subsets. The only subsets of {1,2,3,4,5} whose elements sum to 10 are {5,4,1}, {5,3,2}, and {1,2,3,4}. A set S is forbidden if it contains any of these as a subset. Use inclusion–exclusion on the events “S contains {5,4,1}”, “S contains {5,3,2}”, and “S contains {1,2,3,4}” to count the forbidden sets; this yields 7 forbidden subsets, so 16 − 7 = 9 valid subsets with largest element 5. Thus N_5 = 9 and k = N_5 − 8 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let x = ab + 1, y = bc + 1, z = ca + 1, all positive integers with xyz = 84. Since a,b,c are nonnegative, ab,bc,ca ≥ 0, hence x,y,z ≥ 1. Showing that none of x,y,z can be 2 eliminates all factor triples of 84 that include 2, leaving only permutations of (3,4,7). Thus {ab+1, bc+1, ca+1} = {3,4,7}, so {ab,bc,ca} = {2,3,6}. Then (ab)(bc)(ca) = (abc)^2 = 2·3·6 = 36, so abc = 6. Enumerating ordered positive triples (a,b,c) with product 6 and checking their pairwise products shows that exactly the six permutations of (1,2,3) work, giving 6 positive solutions. Next, consider the case where one variable is zero. If a = 0, then (ab+1)(bc+1)(ca+1) = (1)(bc+1)(1) = 84, so bc = 83, which gives two ordered pairs (b,c) = (1,83) and (83,1). By symmetry, each choice of which variable is zero yields two solutions, giving 3×2 = 6 solutions with exactly one zero coordinate. With two or three zeros, the product is 1, not 84. Thus there are 6 (positive) + 6 (one-zero) = 12 ordered triples.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
