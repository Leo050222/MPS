  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Exploring polynomial equations**\n\nI'm working through the equation \\(m^5 - n^5 = (m-n)(m^4 + m^3n + m^2n^2 + mn^3 + n^4) = 16mn\\). It's tricky, but I'm considering small solutions. If \\(n > 0\\) and \\(m < 0\\), the left-hand side (LHS) would be negative, while the right-hand side (RHS) would also be negative. I’m thinking about factorization or substitution, possibly considering \\(m = -n\\). If that works out, I find that \\((m, n) = (-2, 2)\\) might be a solution. I'll continue checking for other solutions!**Analyzing polynomial solutions**\n\nI’m reexamining the equation where \\((-u)^5 - n^5 = - (u^5 + n^5) = 16(-u)n = -16un\\). After multiplying by -1, I have \\(u^5 + n^5 = 16un\\). The left-hand side (LHS) contains positive terms that grow quickly, while the right-hand side (RHS) behaves quadratically. This suggests I should only test small positive integer combinations. If I let \\(u = n\\), I find a solution \\( (2, 2) \\), which corresponds to what I had earlier with \\((m, n) = (-2, 2)\\). I’ll continue testing other small values.**Exploring polynomial bounds**\n\nI'm trying to evaluate if \\(u^5 + n^5 \\leq 16un\\) is possible. Noticing that for \\(n \\geq 3\\), \\(n^5\\) becomes quite large, while \\(16un \\leq 16u^2\\) if \\(u \\geq n\\). I find that comparing \\(u^5 + n^5\\) doesn't help much, so I'm considering different integer values for \\(n\\). \n\nStarting with \\(n = 1\\), I set up \\(u^5 - 16u + 1 = 0\\) and find no integer roots. Then, for \\(n = 2\\), I determine that \\(u = 2\\) works. I'll keep check the function's behavior beyond that.**Examining polynomial behavior**\n\nI just calculated that for \\(n=2\\), only \\(u=2\\) provides a unique solution, as the function is increasing for \\(u \\geq 2\\). Now looking at \\(n=3\\), I set up the equation \\(u^5 - 48u + 243 = 0\\) and tested integer values for \\(u\\). None produced a valid root.\n\nAs I check near zero, I determine that the function stays positive—no solutions there either. For \\(n \\geq 4\\), the left-hand side grows significantly compared to the right, so there might not be any valid combinations there either. I'll keep digging into inequalities!**Finalizing solutions**\n\nI’m concluding that the only positive integer solution for \\(u^5 + n^5 = 16un\\) is \\((u, n) = (2, 2)\\), which gives \\(m = -2\\) and \\(n = 2\\) as the opposite-sign pair. \n\nNow moving on to the polynomial \\(x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48\\) with roots \\(p < q < r\\), which follow Vieta's relations. I need to minimize \\(S = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r\\) with the constraint \\(pqr = 48\\). I’ll use methods like Lagrange multipliers to optimize under the given constraints, taking ordering into account while analyzing the expression based on symmetry. It’s a bit tricky, but I'm getting there!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI’m wrapping up the reasoning for both problems. For Problem 1, I’m breaking it down into manageable parts: I start by rewriting the equation with opposite signs, reducing it to a simpler form and analyzing small integer cases. This leads me to conclude that the only positive solution is \\(u = n = 2\\), resulting in \\(m = -2\\), \\(n = 2\\), and \\(k = n - 1 = 1\\). \n\nFor Problem 2, I treat the roots with the given product and minimize the expression using Lagrange multipliers, ultimately finding the global minimum of \\(3/2\\). Now, I’ll format this into a clean JSON response!  \n\n{\n \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, rewrite with opposite signs by setting m=-u with u>0, reduce to u^5+n^5=16un, analyze small integer cases and use a growth inequality to show the only positive solution is u=n=2, hence m=-2,n=2 and k=n-1=1. For Problem 2, treat the roots p,q,r>0 with product 48 and minimize 1/p+2/q+3/r under this product constraint via Lagrange multipliers, obtaining the critical point p=2,q=4,r=6, which yields the global minimum value 3/2.\",\n \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, assume the solution pair has opposite signs with n>0 and write m=-u (u>0). The equation becomes u^5 + n^5 = 16un. Using integer case analysis for small n and u and an inequality comparison for u≥3, one finds the only positive integer solution is u = n = 2, corresponding to (m,n)=(-2,2). Thus k = n - 1 = 1. For Problem 2, note that any triple of positive roots p,q,r with product pqr=48 corresponds to some cubic x^3 - a x^2 + b x -48. Minimize S = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r subject to pqr=48 using Lagrange multipliers. The stationarity conditions give 1/p = 2/q = 3/r, so q=2p, r=3p, and the product constraint yields p=2, q=4, r=6. Checking that this critical point is feasible and gives a global minimum, the minimal value of S is 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/6 = 3/2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
