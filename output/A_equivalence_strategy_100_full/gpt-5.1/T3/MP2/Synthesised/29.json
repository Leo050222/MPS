  "math_problem": "Find all prime numbers $p,q,r$ , such that $\\frac{p}{q}-\\frac{4}{r+1}=1$ Instead of finding all prime numbers $p,q,r$ satisfying the given equation, simply find $n = r + 2009$, where $r$ is the prime number such that $r + 1$ equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term. FemtoPravis is walking on an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard that wraps around at its edges (so squares on the left edge of the chessboard are adjacent to squares on the right edge, and similarly for the top and bottom edges). Each femtosecond, FemtoPravis moves in one of the four diagonal directions uniformly at random. After $n$ femtoseconds, what is the probability that FemtoPravis is at his original location?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We solve the Diophantine equation p/q - 4/(r+1) = 1 with p,q,r primes, and r+1 is the denominator of the second fraction. Rewrite: p/q = 1 + 4/(r+1) = (r+1+4)/(r+1) = (r+5)/(r+1). Thus p/q = (r+5)/(r+1). For p and q to be primes, (r+5)/(r+1) must be a reduced fraction with prime numerator and denominator. Compute gcd(r+5, r+1) = gcd(r+1,4), which must be 1 because r+1 = q is prime. Then q cannot divide 4, so q ≠ 2. Hence r+1 is an odd prime, so r is even. The only even prime is 2, so r = 2, giving r+1 = 3. Then p/q = (2+5)/(2+1) = 7/3, so p = 7, q = 3 are primes, and this indeed satisfies 7/3 - 4/3 = 1. Thus r = 2, and n = r + 2009 = 2011. Now consider FemtoPravis on an 8×8 toroidal board moving each step in one of the four diagonal directions: NE(+1,+1), NW(-1,+1), SW(-1,-1), SE(+1,-1) modulo 8. Each step changes the coordinates by (±1, ±1). Key observation: parity. Starting from (0,0) (even,even), one diagonal step takes us to (odd,odd), two steps back to (even,even), etc. After k steps, the parity of each coordinate is k mod 2. Therefore after an odd number of steps (here n = 2011, odd), we must be on a square with both coordinates odd, never on (0,0). Hence the probability of being at the original location after 2011 steps is 0.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
