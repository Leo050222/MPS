For polynomial g(x)=x^4+3x^3+5x,\\nwrite g(x)=x(x^3+3x^2+5), so\\n g(x1)-g(x2)=(x1-x2)[x1^3 + x1^2 x2 + x1 x2^2 + x2^3 + 3(x1^2 + x1 x2 + x2^2) + 5].\\nThus if x1 ≠ x2 and g(x1)=g(x2), we need\\n x1^3 + x1^2 x2 + x1 x2^2 + x2^3 + 3(x1^2 + x1 x2 + x2^2) + 5 = 0.\\n\\n4) Express this symmetric condition in terms of s = x1 + x2 and p = x1 x2.\\nWe know from the quadratic x^2 + x - A = 0 that s = -1 and p = -A.\\nCompute:\\n x1^2 + x1 x2 + x2^2 = s^2 - p.\\n x1^3 + x1^2 x2 + x1 x2^2 + x2^3 = (x1+x2)^3 - 2x1 x2 (x1 + x2) = s^3 - 2ps.\\nSo the condition becomes\\n (s^3 - 2ps) + 3(s^2 - p) + 5 = 0.\\nSubstitute s = -1:\\n s^3 = -1, s^2 = 1, so\\n (-1 - 2p(-1)) + 3(1 - p) + 5 = 0\\n => (-1 + 2p) + 3 - 3p + 5 = 0\\n => (2p - 3p) + (-1 + 3 + 5) = 0\\n => -p + 7 = 0\\n => p = 7.\\nBut p = x1 x2 = -A, so -A = 7 ⇒ A = -7.\\nThus the unique real A that allows distinct complex x1, x2 is A = -7.\\n\\n5) The problem defines k = A + 9, so k = -7 + 9 = 2.\\n\\n6) Now evaluate S = sum_{n=2}^{17} (n^k + n + 1)/(n^4 + 2n^3 - n^k - 2n) with k=2.\\nSubstitute k=2:\\n Numerator: n^k + n + 1 = n^2 + n + 1.\\n Denominator: n^4 + 2n^3 - n^k - 2n = n^4 + 2n^3 - n^2 - 2n.\\nFactor the denominator:\\n n^4 + 2n^3 - n^2 - 2n = n^2(n^2 + 2n -1) - 2n\\nFactor by grouping:\\n = n^2(n^2 + 2n -1) - 2n = n(n^3 + 2n^2 - n - 2).\\nNow factor the cubic n^3 + 2n^2 - n - 2:\\nGroup terms: (n^3 + 2n^2) + (-n - 2) = n^2(n+2) -1(n+2) = (n^2 -1)(n+2) = (n-1)(n+1)(n+2).\\nSo denominator = n * (n-1)(n+1)(n+2).\\n\\n7) The summand simplifies to\\n T_n = (n^2 + n + 1) / [n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2)].\\nPerform partial fraction decomposition. Suppose\\n (n^2 + n + 1)/[n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2)] = A/n + B/(n-1) + C/(n+1) + D/(n+2).\\nMultiply both sides by n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2):\\n n^2 + n + 1 = A(n-1)(n+1)(n+2) + B n(n+1)(n+2) + C n(n-1)(n+2) + D n(n-1)(n+1).\\nPlug convenient n values:\\n- For n=0: LHS = 1, RHS = A(-1)(1)(2) = -2A ⇒ A = -1/2.\\n- For n=1: LHS = 1^2 +1 +1 = 3, RHS = B*1*2*3 = 6B ⇒ B = 1/2.\\n- For n=-1: LHS = 1 -1 +1 = 1, RHS = C*(-1)(-2)(1) = 2C ⇒ C = 1/2.\\n- For n=-2: LHS = 4 -2 +1 = 3, RHS = D*(-2)(-3)(-1) = -6D ⇒ D = -1/2.\\nThus\\n T_n = -1/(2n) + 1/[2(n-1)] + 1/[2(n+1)] - 1/[2(n+2)].\\n\\n8) So the sum from n=2 to 17 is\\n S = sum_{n=2}^{17} T_n\\n   = 1/2 * sum_{n=2}^{17} [1/(n-1) - 1/n + 1/(n+1) - 1/(n+2)].\\nSplit into four sums:\\n S = 1/2 * [ sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/(n-1) - sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/n + sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/(n+1) - sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/(n+2) ].\\nRewrite indices in terms of harmonic numbers H_m = 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/m:\\n- sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/(n-1) = sum_{k=1}^{16} 1/k = H_{16}.\\n- sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/n = H_{17} - 1.\\n- sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/(n+1) = sum_{k=3}^{18} 1/k = H_{18} - (1 + 1/2) = H_{18} - 3/2.\\n- sum_{n=2}^{17} 1/(n+2) = sum_{k=4}^{19} 1/k = H_{19} - (1 + 1/2 + 1/3) = H_{19} - 11/6.\\nThus\\n S = 1/2 * [ H_{16} - (H_{17} - 1) + (H_{18} - 3/2) - (H_{19} - 11/6) ]\\n   = 1/2 * [ H_{16} - H_{17} +1 + H_{18} - 3/2 - H_{19} + 11/6 ].\\nUse H_{17} = H_{16} + 1/17, H_{18} = H_{17} + 1/18 = H_{16} + 1/17 + 1/18, H_{19} = H_{18} + 1/19 = H_{16} + 1/17 + 1/18 + 1/19.\\nCompute the harmonic combination:\\n H_{16} - H_{17} + H_{18} - H_{19}\\n = H_{16} - (H_{16} + 1/17) + (H_{16} + 1/17 + 1/18) - (H_{16} + 1/17 + 1/18 + 1/19)\\n = [H_{16} - H_{16}] - 1/17 + H_{16} + 1/17 + 1/18 - H_{16} - 1/17 - 1/18 - 1/19\\n = -1/17 + 1/17 + 1/18 - 1/17 - 1/18 - 1/19\\n = -1/17 - 1/19.\\nTherefore the bracket becomes\\n H_{16} - H_{17} +1 + H_{18} - 3/2 - H_{19} + 11/6\\n = (H_{16} - H_{17} + H_{18} - H_{19}) + (1 - 3/2 + 11/6)\\n = (-1/17 - 1/19) + (1 - 3/2 + 11/6).\\nCompute the constant: 1 - 3/2 + 11/6 = (6/6 - 9/6 + 11/6) = 8/6 = 4/3.\\nSo inside bracket: 4/3 - 1/17 - 1/19.\\nConvert to a single fraction:\\n 4/3 = 4 * (17*19)/(3*17*19) = 4*323/ (3*323) = 1292/969.\\n 1/17 + 1/19 = (19+17)/(17*19) = 36/323.\\nPut over common denominator 969 = 3*323:\\n 36/323 = (36*3)/969 = 108/969.\\nSo inside bracket = 1292/969 - 108/969 = 1184/969.\\nHence\\n S = 1/2 * 1184/969 = 592/969.\\nThis fraction is already in lowest terms (592 = 2^4*37, 969 = 3^3*359; no common prime factors), so\\n S = 592/969.\\n\\nThus the requested sum equals 592/969.\",\n    \"answer\": \"592/969\"\n}",
