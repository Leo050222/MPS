  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be square with 4 digits, such that all its digits are less than 6. If we add 1 to each digit the resulting number is another square. Find $n$ Instead of identifying the 4-digit perfect square satisfying the digit increment condition, simply find $m = a - 42$, where $a$ is the integer whose square is that number. P is a polynomial. When P is divided by $x-1$, the remainder is -4 . When P is divided by $x-2$, the remainder is -1 . When $P$ is divided by $x-3$, the remainder is 4 . Determine the remainder when $P$ is divided by $x^{m}-6 x^{2}+11 x-6$.",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Exploring perfect squares**\n\nI'm examining perfect squares, starting with n = a^2, where n corresponds to perfect squares between 1000 and 5999. After determining that a must range from 32 to 74, I'm calculating n' by increasing each digit of n by 1. This means n' will fall between 2111 and 6666, giving potential values for b. I want to check valid squares in this range but already found that 32^2 = 1024 yields a non-square in n'. It seems I need to discard values that exceed our limits.**Continuing with perfect squares**\n\nOkay, I'm still checking perfect squares! I went through 34^2 and 35^2, finding that 35^2 worked with digits all ≤5, giving n' as 2336. However, it wasn’t a perfect square. Moving to 36^2 and 37^2, both included digits greater than 5, so I discarded them. \n\nWhen I reached 38^2, it was valid with n' as 2555. I saw n = 2025 from 45^2, while n' = 3136 which equals 56^2, so this works! Now I’m checking for more possible values.**Continuing with squares and polynomials**\n\nAlright, I'm running through more perfect squares. I checked up to 74^2, and found many with digits above 5, so I discarded those. The only valid solution is with a=45, giving n=2025. I calculated m as 3, so now I need to focus on the polynomial part. Since I know the remainders for specific values (like P(1) = -4), I’m looking into the polynomial P(x) and preparing for division by a cubic expression with roots 1, 2, and 3. Let’s keep going!**Finding the polynomial remainder**\n\nI'm determining the remainder R(x) when dividing by a cubic polynomial, and it’ll have a degree of 2, expressed as R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. Since I know P(1), P(2), and P(3), I'll set those equal to R(x) to create a system of equations.\n\nAfter working through some equations, I discovered that a = 1, b = 0, and c = -5, leading to the final remainder of R(x) = x^2 - 5. I'll check if they want \"x^2 - 5\" or to clarify m as well.**Clarifying remainder and m**\n\nThe problem is to determine the remainder when P is divided by a specific polynomial. While m is needed to define the divisor, the final question focuses on the remainder. I’m definitely leaning toward providing the remainder, which is x^2 - 5. Although they mentioned m earlier, they didn’t explicitly ask for it in the final answer.\n\nFor my final output, I’ll format it in JSON: including concise reasoning while ensuring the answer itself stays clear. I'll summarize accordingly.</think>\n\n{  \n  \"reasoning\": \"We first find the 4-digit square n with all digits < 6 such that adding 1 to each digit yields another perfect square.\\n\\n1) Let n = a^2 be a 4-digit number with digits all ≤ 5.
