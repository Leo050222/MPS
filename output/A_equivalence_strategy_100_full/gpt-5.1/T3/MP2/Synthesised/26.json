  "math_problem": "Tetrahedron $A B C D$ with volume 1 is inscribed in circumsphere $\\omega$ such that $A B=A C=A D=2$ and $B C \\cdot C D \\cdot D B=16$. Find the radius of $\\omega$. Instead of determining the circumradius of the sphere containing all four vertices, simply find $\\delta = AX - \\frac{7}{10}$, where $AX$ is the altitude from vertex $A$ to the plane of face $BCD$. In the Cartesian plane, let $A=(0,0)$, $B=(200,100)$, and $C=(30,330)$. Compute the number of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of integers so that $\\left(x+\\delta, y+\\delta\\right)$ is in the interior of triangle $A B C$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"1) Let the side lengths from vertex A be AB = AC = AD = 2. Set vectors from A in 3D: |b| = |c| = |d| = 2. Let a = BC, b' = CD, c' = DB. Given a·b'·c' = 16 and volume V = 1. The volume of tetrahedron ABCD is V = (1/6)| (AB × AC) · AD |.\\n\\n2) Let u = AB, v = AC, w = AD, all of length 2. Define pairwise dot products: u·v = u·w = v·w = p (by symmetry among B,C,D distances from A). Then lengths squared:\\nBC^2 = |u − v|^2 = |u|^2 + |v|^2 − 2u·v = 8 − 2p  ⇒ a^2 = 8 − 2p\\nCD^2 = |v − w|^2 = 8 − 2p ⇒ b'^2 = 8 − 2p\\nDB^2 = |w − u|^2 = 8 − 2p ⇒ c'^2 = 8 − 2p\\nThus BC = CD = DB, an equilateral base of side s = √(8 − 2p). The given product BC·CD·DB = s^3 = 16 ⇒ s^3 = 16 ⇒ s = 2·2^(1/3) = 2·∛2. Hence:\\n8 − 2p = s^2 = 4·∛(4) ⇒ 2p = 8 − 4·∛4 ⇒ p = 4 − 2·∛4.\\n\\n3) Compute volume using base BCD and height AX. Base BCD is equilateral with side s, area = (√3/4)s^2. Let h = AX. Volume V = (1/3)(area of BCD)·h = 1. So:\\n1 = (1/3)·(√3/4)·s^2·h ⇒ h = 12 / (√3·s^2).\\nBut s^2 = 4·∛4, so h = 12 / (√3 · 4·∛4) = 3 / (√3·∛4).\\nThus AX = h = 3 / (√3·∛4).\\n\\n4) Simplify AX and compute δ = AX − 7/10. First, AX = 3/(√3·2^(2/3)). Multiply numerator and denominator appropriately: write 3 = √3·√3, so AX = √3·√3 / (√3·2^(2/3)) = √3 / 2^(2/3). So AX = √3 / 2^(2/3). Then δ = √3 / 2^(2/3) − 7/10.\\n\\n5) Now consider triangle ABC in the plane with A = (0,0), B = (200,100), C = (30,330). A translation by vector (δ, δ) is a bijection on the integer lattice, so the number of integer pairs (x, y) such that (x + δ, y + δ) lies inside triangle ABC equals the number of integer points (u,v) strictly inside triangle ABC. Therefore we need only count interior lattice points of triangle ABC.\\n\\n6) Compute area of triangle ABC. Use determinant/ shoelace: Area = (1/2)|x1(y2 − y3) + x2(y3 − y1) + x3(y1 − y2)| with A(0,0), B(200,100), C(30,330):\\nArea = (1/2)|0·(100 − 330) + 200·(330 − 0) + 30·(0 − 100)| = (1/2)|0 + 200·330 − 30·100| = (1/2)(66000 − 3000) = (1/2)·63000 = 31500.\\n\\n7) Compute number of lattice points on the boundary of triangle ABC. Let the three edges be AB, BC, CA.\\n- For segment AB from (0,0) to (200,100), boundary lattice points count is gcd(|200 − 0|, |100 − 0|) + 1 = gcd(200,100) + 1 = 100 + 1 = 101.\\n- For segment BC from (200,100) to (30,330), differences: Δx = 170, Δy = 230 in absolute value. gcd(170,230) = 10 (since 170 = 2·5·17 and 230 = 2·5·23). So points on BC: 10 + 1 = 11.\\n- For segment CA from (30,330) to (0,0), differences: Δx = 30, Δy = 330, gcd(30,330) = 30. Points: 30 + 1 = 31.\\nTotal boundary point count B is 101 + 11 + 31 − 3 = 140 (subtract 3 because vertices counted twice each in segment counts).\\n\\n8) Use Pick's theorem: Area = I + B/2 − 1, where I is number of interior lattice points, B is boundary lattice points. Given Area = 31500, B = 140:\\n31500 = I + 140/2 − 1 = I + 70 − 1 = I + 69 ⇒ I = 31500 − 69 = 31431.\\n\\n9) Therefore the number of ordered integer pairs (x, y) so that (x + δ, y + δ) lies in the interior of triangle ABC equals 31431. This does not depend on δ, so we need not simplify δ further for the counting problem.\\n\\n10) The final required answer is 31431.\",\n    \"answer\": \"31431\"\n}",
