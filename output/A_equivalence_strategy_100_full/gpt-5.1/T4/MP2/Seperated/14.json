  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing number properties**\n\nI'm considering properties of even and odd numbers. If n is even, then 2 divides it, and 2^n + 2 is also even, which seems straightforward. If n is odd and greater than 1, the greatest common divisor is 1, allowing for Euler or Fermat's theorem applications.\n\nUsing these, I derive that 2^n ≡ -2 mod n. If n is less than 100, maybe a systematic deduction could work, although using known sequences might be easier if I weren't restricted online. I'll start by checking if n is a prime candidate.**Exploring prime factors**\n\nI realize that if 2 ≡ -2 mod p, then 4 ≡ 0, meaning p divides 4. This gives p = 2 as the only prime solution since p can't be 4. For p = 2, the expression 2^2 + 2 equals 6, which is divisible by 2.\n\nNow, I want to explore odd composites greater than 1. I notice that with 2^(n-1) ≡ -1, there might be contradictions according to Carmichael's theorem. For instance, n = 3 shows that 2^3 + 2 equals 10, which is not divisible by 3. As I evaluate, I wonder if all solutions less than 100 are powers of 2. I'll consider modulo small primes and narrow down possibilities logically.**Analyzing odd n values**\n\nI'm looking at odd n values greater than or equal to 3. Since 2 and n are coprime, I can multiply both sides of the equation 2^n ≡ -2 by the inverse of 2, resulting in 2^{n-1} ≡ -1. Raising both sides shows that the order d divides 2n-2 but not n-1, which might seem tricky.\n\nThen, I check if odd composite n makes 2^{n-1} ≡ -1 mod n imply n = 3. However, n = 3 fails because 2^{n-1} equals 4 ≡ 1 mod 3, not -1. So, it looks like I can narrow down my candidates further using modulo 3 properties; if 3 divides n, it won’t divide 2^n + 2. Thus, n can't be divisible by 3 for solutions greater than 1.**Examining factors and cycles**\n\nI'm checking the factors of 5 by computing 2^n + 2 mod 5. The cycle for powers of 2 mod 5 is 4: 2, 4, 3, 1. Based on n mod 4, I get different results: if n mod 4 = 0, it results in 3; n ≡ 1 gives 4; n ≡ 2 leads to 1; and n ≡ 3 equals 0, meaning that 5 divides 2^n + 2 when n ≡ 3 mod 4.\n\nNext, I'm considering factor 7 and gathering numbers less than 100 that meet this property. Since n must divide 2^n + 2, I notice that for any prime p dividing n, 2^{n-1} ≡ -1 mod p. It's getting intricate, but I want to figure out the order of 2 modulo p and other related details.**Examining divisibility and patterns**\n\nI’m working through the factors for n, focusing on odd and even scenarios. If I factor 2 out for even n, I find that condition transforms to m dividing 2^{n-1} + 1. Checking small values for odd and even numbers under 100 helps understand how many may be valid.\n\nSo far, I see clear candidates like n = 2 and n = 6. I run through candidates and find that while n = 6 works, others such as n = 10 might not. I wonder if there are consistent remainders for even numbers—perhaps n greater than 2 won't satisfy requirements, mainly because we need to avoid multiples of 3.**Revising factors and conditions**\n\nI’m reconsidering the situation with n, especially with n being multiples of 3. Initially, I thought if n were odd, 2^n + 2 would not connect with mod 3 well. But actually, if n is a multiple of 3, it can work under specific criteria, particularly when n is a multiple of 6. \n\nSo now I’m testing multiples of 6 under 100 for divisibility of 2^n + 2. I’ve confirmed that n = 6 works, but larger candidates like 18 and 30 do not. I suspect that n = 6 may be the only valid solution as I keep checking to confirm my findings about odd numbers and their properties regarding divisibility.**Testing divisibility conditions**\n\nSo, if n is odd and not just 1, φ(n) will be even, which complicates things further. I'm settling on possible candidates for n as 1, 2, and 6 based on earlier checks. However, I have to verify if larger values like 24 or 54 might also work. \n\nAs I check multiples of 6 up to 100, I've confirmed that 6 works, but many others do not. It seems 66 is a valid solution, being divisible by 2, 3, and 11. I’ll need to keep searching for any other potential candidates under 100.**Analyzing candidates under 100**\n\nI'm focusing on candidates for n that are less than 100 and contain prime factors under 100. For each prime p dividing n (excluding 2), I need to ensure that n meets the condition of 2^n + 2 ≡ 0 mod p. I already found n = 66 as a solution.\n\nNow, I’m investigating other combinations, especially checking if n could be multiples of primes like 5 or 3, but also evaluating their other prime factors. I’ll systematically check other candidates to find possibilities and eliminate those that don't fulfill the conditions.**Exploring modular conditions**\n\nI'm focusing on primes p starting from 41 and how they impact n under 100. For each prime, n can either be the prime itself or its multiples. However, for n to satisfy 2^n + 2 ≡ 0 mod p, I need to find values k where k mod (p - 1) works. \n\nI'll check the conditions systematically and ensure that if there's a valid m found within the limits, n = p*m will be a potential candidate. If any prime doesn't yield a satisfactory m, then that p will be excluded from consideration for n.**Analyzing prime factors in modular conditions**\n\nI'm considering how different primes, like 5 and their powers like 25, affect n under 100. For p=11, I find that 2^m ≡ 9 mod 11 gives only n = 66 as valid. \n\nI also explore primes like 3, where m must be even. For primes like 5, I check possible m values up to a certain limit. I find that while some primes can be included, others like 7, 17, and 19 are excluded due to modular constraints. Ultimately, it looks like the possible primes dividing n are 2, 3, 5, and 11, with 11 being unique in yielding n = 66.**Evaluating factors and prime constraints**\n\nI'm looking into n values having factor 5 but not necessarily 11. This gives candidates like 15, 35, and 55, which all need to meet other prime factor constraints.\n\nFor n divisible by 3, m must be even. Prime 11 applies only to n = 66. My focus reduces to finding n < 100 formed by primes 2, 3, 5, and maybe 11. I systematically generate numbers, avoiding those with larger primes. \n\nSorting around this, I find the full list of candidates, and now I need to verify each against divisibility conditions for primes 3, 5, and 11 based on the earlier modular analysis.**Testing congruences for candidates**\n\nI'm examining the candidates in set S for their prime factorizations and corresponding congruences for odd primes 3, 5, and 11. I’ve confirmed the modular conditions: 2^n ≡ -2 mod5 requires n ≡ 3 mod4. For 11, n ≡ 6 mod10 holds, and for 3, n must be even. \n\nI then create a sorted table of candidates to check. After applying these congruences and filtering out those that don't satisfy, I’m left with candidates including 1, 2, 4, 6, and 96, among others. \n\nNext, I need to verify complete divisibility for each candidate to find the largest n < 100 that meets these conditions.**Filtering candidates for divisibility**\n\nI'm assessing candidates that may not satisfy the condition n|2^n+2, especially those divisible by 4. It turns out if n has a highest power of 2 (a) equal to or greater than 2, then n cannot divide 2^n+2. The candidates must either be odd or two times an odd number but not a multiple of 4. \n\nAfter filtering, my possible candidates are now narrowed down to {1, 2, 6, 18, 54, 66}. I need to check each of these numbers for their divisibility against 2^n+2 more carefully. After analyzing, I find that only {1, 2, 6, 66} qualify, with 66 being the largest valid n under 100. I conclude that e = n + 1926 = 1992.**Calculating region counts with lines**\n\nI'm considering how to compute the number of regions as I add horizontal and non-horizontal lines. Starting with h horizontal lines divides the plane into h+1 regions. Then, I introduce s non-horizontal lines, noting that they can't be parallel or concurrent.\n\nEach new line adds regions based on its intersections. After calculating, I've established an equation that gives the total regions as R = 1 + h(s+1) + s(s+1)/2. Setting this equal to 1992 helps me determine positive integer solutions for h and s. After testing various factors of 3982, I find viable solutions, specifically h = 995 and s = 1, which satisfy all conditions. Thus, everything checks out perfectly!**Checking integer solutions**\n\nI'm looking for valid positive integer pairs of h and s. While I initially confirmed (995, 1) works, I need to explore all factor pairs of 3982 where s is at least 1. I've gone through the divisors and computed corresponding h values, checking their viability. For s=1, 10, and 21, I found valid pairs: (995, 1), (176, 10), and (80, 21). No other pairs yield positive integers, so these three pairs are my final solutions!</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We need n < 100 with n | (2^n + 2), and then take e = n + 1926 for the largest such n. For any prime p ≥ 3 dividing n, using Fermat’s theorem modulo p shows that 2^n + 2 ≡ 0 (mod p) forces a specific congruence condition on n modulo p−1. Checking primes up to 100, one finds that if p divides n and 2^n + 2 ≡ 0 (mod p), then p must be in {2,3,5,11}; primes like 7,13,17,19,23,29,31,… cannot occur as factors of n because there is no exponent n < 100 making 2^n ≡ −2 (mod p). For these remaining primes, explicit congruence conditions hold: if 3 | n then n must be even; if 5 | n then n ≡ 3 (mod 4); if 11 | n then n ≡ 6 (mod 10). Also, from considering divisibility by powers of 2, any n divisible by 4 fails, because for n ≥ 2 and any a ≥ 2, 2^n ≡ 0 (mod 2^a), so 2^n + 2 ≡ 2 (mod 2^a) and cannot be divisible by 2^a. Thus n can be only odd or of the form 2·(odd). Restricting n < 100 to those with prime factors in {2,3,5,11}, applying the congruence filters for 3,5,11, and eliminating multiples of 4, leaves the candidates {1,2,6,18,54,66}. Checking divisibility by the required higher prime powers (e.g., 9 or 27 for 18,54; 2,3,11 for 66), we find that 18 and 54 fail modulo 9 and 27 respectively, while 1,2,6,66 work. Among these, the largest n < 100 is 66, so e = 66 + 1926 = 1992.\\n\\nProblem 2: With h horizontal lines and s additional non-horizontal, pairwise non-parallel lines, with no three of the total h + s lines concurrent, we can count regions by adding lines one at a time. First place the h horizontal lines: each new horizontal line is parallel to the previous ones, intersects no earlier line, and thus adds exactly 1 new region. Starting from 1 region, after h horizontals we have 1 + h regions. Next, add the s non-horizontal lines. The k-th such line (k from 1 to s) intersects all h horizontal lines and all k−1 previously added non-horizontal lines, and, by the “no three concurrent” condition, all these intersection points are distinct. Hence this k-th line is cut into h + (k−1) + 1 = h + k segments, adding h + k new regions. Therefore the total number of regions is\\nR = 1 + h + sum_{k=1}^s (h + k) = 1 + h + sh + s(s+1)/2.\\nWe set R = 1992 and solve:\\n1 + h + sh + s(s+1)/2 = 1992.\\nMultiply by 2:\\n2h + 2sh + s(s+1) = 3982,\\nwhich factors as (s+1)(2h + s) = 3982.\\nFactoring 3982 = 2 × 11 × 181, all positive divisor pairs (s+1, 2h + s) are (2,1991), (11,362), (22,181), (181,22), (362,11), (1991,2), (3982,1). Since s must be positive, s+1 ≥ 2, and 2h + s must be positive, we test each:\\n- s+1 = 2 → s = 1, 2h + 1 = 1991 → h = 995.\\n- s+1 = 11 → s = 10, 2h + 10 = 362 → h = 176.\\n- s+1 = 22 → s = 21, 2h + 21 = 181 → h = 80.\\nThe larger divisor choices lead to negative h and are rejected. Thus the positive integer pairs (h,s) satisfying the region condition are (995,1), (176,10), and (80,21). Geometrically, each pair can be realized: horizontals are parallel; the s non-horizontal lines are chosen with distinct slopes, none horizontal, and placed so that no three of the total lines are concurrent.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1992\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"(995,1),(176,10),(80,21)\"\n}",
