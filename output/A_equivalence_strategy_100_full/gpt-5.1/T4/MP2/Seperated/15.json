      "A3384": "One day, there is a Street Art Show at somewhere, and there are some spectators around. We consider this place as an Euclidean plane. Let $K$ be the center of the show. And name the spectators by $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}, \\ldots$ They pick their positions $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}, \\ldots$ one by one. The positions need to satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously. (i) The distance between $K$ and $A_{n}$ is no less than 10 meters, that is, $K P_{n} \\geq 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any positive integer $n$. (ii) The distance between $A_{n}$ and any previous spectator is no less than 1 meter, that is, $P_{m} P_{n} \\geq 1 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any $n \\geq 2$ and any $1 \\leq m \\leq n-1$. (iii) $A_{n}$ always choose the position closest to $K$ that satisfies (i) and (ii), that is, $K P_{n}$ reaches its minimum possible value. If there are more than one point that satisfy (i) and (ii) and have the minimum distance to $K, A_{n}$ may choose any one of them. For example, $A_{1}$ is not restricted by (ii), so he may choose any point on the circle $C$ which is centered at $K$ with radius 10 meters. For $A_{2}$, since there are lots of points on $C$ which are at least 1 meter apart from $P_{1}$, he may choose anyone of them. (1) Which of the following statement is true? (A) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2}$ always hold (unit: meter); (B) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\sqrt{n} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} \\sqrt{n}$ always hold (unit: meter); (C) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n$ always hold (unit: meter); (D) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n^{2} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n^{2}$ always hold (unit: meter)."

  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Calculating spectators in a circle**\n\nTo find out how to fit n spectators inside a circle of radius R, we can focus on the area of the annulus outside a smaller circle. The condition is π(R^2-10^2) must be greater than or equal to n times the area per spectator. If I assume each spectator occupies a disk with a radius of 1/2, that area is π/4. So, I'll keep figuring this out based on the provided inequalities.**Determining radius bounds**\n\nI'm figuring out that the inequality gives a lower bound on R for fitting n spectators within circle radius R. I've considered the n spectators with their positions inside the radius, using the area inequality to establish an upper limit on n. So if I want the smallest R for a given n that meets the conditions, it seems like R must be at least proportional to the square root of n. However, I'm also pondering whether the radius for the n-th spectator can be closer to the center than previous ones.**Exploring spectator placements**\n\nI'm considering whether earlier spectators might occupy certain directions, leaving other directions close to distance 10 unused. Each spectator must maintain at least a distance of 1 from the prior ones, so their placements are somewhat restricted. For instance, the first spectator could be at distance 10, while the second might be slightly further, at an angle. I calculate that within a circle of radius 10, I can place about 62 spectators, but I'm curious about whether KP_n is nondecreasing, since later spectators could potentially fit at distance 10, regardless of earlier choices.**Analyzing spectator choices**\n\nI'm realizing that if each spectator picks their position greedily, then for any n, if there's a feasible point at radius 10, they will choose that or another radius of 10. They can't choose a larger radius if a spot at radius 10 is available. If a spectator ends up at a radius greater than 10, it implies no points were allowed at radius 10, meaning future spectators can't find spots closer than the current minimum. I see how this means that the minimal feasible radius for KP_n is monotone nondecreasing.**Bounding spectator radius**\n\nI'm working to understand the radius for n spectators, noting that they should fit within KP_n. The area packing inequality helps me conclude that n ≤ C KP_n^2, leading me to find that KP_n must be at a lower bound of c√n. However, I then realize that even with poor placements, as long as spectators are given constraints, KP_n cannot exceed C√n. For upper limits, I'm analyzing how the placement of spectators with exclusion discs affects feasible regions and their implications on necessary crowd density requirements.**Finalizing reasoning for KP_n**\n\nI need to show that for larger n, c1√n must be less than or equal to √(n/4) - 1/2. The minimal KP_n for all sequences should be at least max(10, √(n/4) - 1/2). I figure out that I can use L_n as a lower bound. Analyzing the ratios gives me a positive c1, which leads to the conclusion that statement B is true. Contrarily, statements A, C, and D can be shown false due to conflicting bounds and implications. Now I have to compile my final answer in JSON format while maintaining clarity and correctness.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We are told f1(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 48) and asked to rewrite it as f1(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 6k). Matching coefficients gives x^2 + 48 = x^2 + 6k, so 6k = 48 and k = 8. Then e = k - 1 = 7.\\n\\nProblem 2: Each spectator must stay at least distance 1 from others and at least distance 10 from K, and always chooses the closest allowable point to K. Geometrically, each spectator creates a forbidden disk of radius 1 around their position. Up to step n, the minimal radius KP_n is nondecreasing, and all n spectators lie within distance KP_n of K.\\n\\nLower bound: Place a disk of radius 1/2 around each spectator; these disks are disjoint (since pairwise distances are at least 1) and all lie in a circle of radius KP_n + 1/2 about K. Comparing total disk area to the area of that circle gives a bound of the form KP_n >= c1 * sqrt(n) for some positive constant c1.\\n\\nUpper bound: Before spectator n chooses, the existing n-1 forbidden disks of radius 1 cover all points with radius less than KP_n that are at least 10 from K; otherwise there would be a closer admissible point. Thus the union of these n-1 radius-1 disks must cover an annulus from radius 10 up to just below KP_n. Comparing the area of this annulus to the total area of those n-1 disks yields an inequality of the form KP_n <= c2 * sqrt(n) for some positive constant c2.\\n\\nThese two area-packing arguments together show that, regardless of the exact choices among equally good positions, KP_n grows on the order of sqrt(n) and is sandwiched between constant multiples of sqrt(n). Hence statement (B) is true, and (A), (C), and (D) are false.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"7\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"B\"\n}",
