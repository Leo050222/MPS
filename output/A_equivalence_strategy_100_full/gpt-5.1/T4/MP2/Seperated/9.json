  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing mathematical properties**\n\nI'm rewriting the equation σ(n)/n = p - 1, where p is the largest prime factor. I realize p - 1 < p ≤ p(n) ≤ n, unless n is a power of 2. I also note that σ(n)/n is multiplicative: it's defined as the product of its prime factors. For a prime power q^a, σ(q^a)/q^a simplifies to yield insights about integer values. I wonder when σ(n)/n can be an integer and consider perfect numbers in this context. Exploring patterns for small n could be helpful.**Exploring prime factorization**\n\nI'm testing with n = p and find that it doesn't yield integer solutions. Next, I try n = p^a, a prime power, and formulate the equation based on σ(n). It becomes complex, and after some rearrangement, I realize no solutions exist. I conclude that n must have at least two prime factors. The next step is to explore if n can be represented as a product of distinct primes. I wonder if that might lead to different results!**Analyzing semiprimes**\n\nI'm working with n = pq, where p and q are primes, starting with both α and β set to 1. The function σ(n) leads to the equation involving primes. After multiplying and expanding both sides, I get a more complex expression to solve. It seems tough, so I'm considering small primes for potential solutions. I suspect that these conditions relate to k = 2, meaning semiprimes. There's an important statement about verifying if n can be represented this way, ensuring consistent distinct prime factors across integers.**Using algebra for σ(n)**\n\nI'm starting to simplify some algebra involving n, which has its largest prime p. The equation σ(n) = n(p - 1) comes up, and I realize that p divides n. But does it also divide σ(n)? Since σ(n) sums divisors, I notice the multiplicative property of σ. \n\nI'll factor n as p^a * m, where m shares no prime factors with p. Rearranging gives me σ(m), which depends on primes less than p. I also examine the ratio σ(n)/n = p - 1 to analyze further.**Exploring primes and bounding n**\n\nI'm considering the primes that can divide ab, specifically those congruent to 3 mod 4. If we have primes less than or equal to √n, they must divide either a or b. I realize that small n might be the key here and start analyzing inequalities involving the product of primes, or primorials.\n\nI'm looking to see how the inequality of these products compares to n. An approximation shows that these conditions might limit n to values less than 100, so I'm thinking I can check manually for sums of two coprime squares in this range. It's about finding valid candidates while ensuring they satisfy the prime conditions I’ve derived!**Evaluating candidates for n**\n\nI'm examining potential values for n, particularly focusing on those less than 49 that can be expressed as a sum of two squares with coprime integers. I calculate various products of primes and check the primes up to √n. \n\nSo far, I realize I need to check specific pairs that yield valid representations. The candidates I'm looking at include 1, 2, 5, and others, while verifying that the primes less than or equal to √n divide their product. This should guide me to the solutions I need!**Determining valid values for n**\n\nI'm checking potential values for n, specifically looking at their representations as sums of squares with the gcd condition. I've found that candidates such as 1, 2, 5, and 13 satisfy the conditions, while others like 10, 17, 25, and 37 fail due to their inability to meet prime divisibility rules. I need to ensure that I’m ordering my final answers correctly and considering if numbers like 1 or 2 should be included based on the problem's requirements. \n\nNow, time to finalize the output format!</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let n ≥ 2 and p = p(n) be the largest prime divisor of n. The condition σ(n)/(p−1) = n is equivalent to σ(n)/n = p−1, so the abundancy index σ(n)/n is an integer equal to p−1. Using multiplicativity, σ(n)/n = ∏ (1 + 1/p_i + … + 1/p_i^{a_i}) < ∏ p_i/(p_i−1), where the product ranges over the distinct prime divisors p_i of n, all ≤ p. Hence σ(n)/n < ∏_{q≤p} q/(q−1). A direct computation of this upper bound shows that for p ≥ 5 we always have p−1 > ∏_{q≤p} q/(q−1), so the equality σ(n)/n = p−1 is impossible; thus p can only be 2 or 3. For p = 2, n must be a power of 2 and one checks directly that no power of 2 satisfies the equation. For p = 3, the prime divisors of n are contained in {2,3}, so n = 2^a 3^b with b ≥ 1. Solving σ(2^a 3^b)/(2^a 3^b) = 2 using the explicit formulas for σ(2^a) and σ(3^b) yields the unique solution n = 6. Hence any such n has exactly the two distinct prime factors 2 and 3, so k = 2 and e = k − 1 = 1. Problem 2: Write n = a^2 + b^2 with gcd(a,b) = 1 and assume every prime p ≤ √n divides ab. Let x = √n. All primes ≤ x must divide ab, and since gcd(a,b) = 1 each such prime divides exactly one of a or b. Thus |ab| is at least the product of all primes ≤ x (the primorial up to x), call it Q(x). On the other hand, |a|, |b| ≤ x, so |ab| ≤ x^2 = n. Therefore Q(x) ≤ n, which severely restricts x because Q(x) grows much faster than x^2. Computing Q(t) for integer t and comparing with (t+1)^2 shows that once t ≥ 7 we always have Q(t) > (t+1)^2, so no n with √n ≥ 7 is possible; therefore n < 49. Now list all n < 49 that can be written as a^2 + b^2 with gcd(a,b) = 1, and for each such n test the condition that all primes p ≤ √n divide ab. Checking all possibilities shows that exactly n = 1, 2, 5, 13 admit representations a^2 + b^2 with gcd(a,b) = 1 satisfying the prime-divisibility condition.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1,2,5,13\"\n}",
