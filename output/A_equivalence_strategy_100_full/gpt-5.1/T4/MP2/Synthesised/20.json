  "math_problem": "Find all positive integers $n, k_1, \\dots, k_n$ such that $k_1 + \\cdots + k_n = 5n-4$ and \\[ \\frac{1}{k_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{k_n} = 1. \\] Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ and corresponding $k_1, \\dots, k_n$ satisfying the sum and reciprocal sum conditions, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the part size in the solution with the smallest possible $n$, derived from the structural consideration of minimal number of terms in the representation. Alice and Bob play a game on a board consisting of one row of $k + 2021$ consecutive squares. They take turns placing tiles that cover two adjacent squares, with Alice going first. By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule. Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends; Bob's goal is to minimize it. What is the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure at the end of the game, no matter how Bob plays?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We want positive integers n and k_i with sum k_1+...+k_n = 5n-4 and reciprocal sum 1/k_1+...+1/k_n = 1. Let S1 = sum k_i and S2 = sum 1/k_i. Condition 1 gives S1 = 5n-4; condition 2 gives S2 = 1. By Cauchy: (sum k_i)(sum 1/k_i) >= n^2, so S1*S2 >= n^2. Here S1*S2 = (5n-4)*1 >= n^2, so 5n-4 >= n^2, or n^2 - 5n + 4 <= 0, i.e. (n-1)(n-4) <= 0, so 1 <= n <= 4. We need minimal possible n with a valid solution. Try n=1: then k_1 = 5(1)-4 =1 and 1/k_1=1 holds, so n=1 works with k_1=1. That is the minimal n; in structural terms, this is the trivial one-term representation. Thus the relevant part size is k=1. Now in the game, the board length is k+2021 = 1+2021 = 2022 squares. Alice and Bob alternately place dominoes (covering 2 adjacent squares) on a 1x2022 strip; the game ends when no moves remain. Each move reduces the number of uncovered squares by 2. If a total of m moves are made, the uncovered squares are 2022 - 2m. Because the board is a single interval and dominoes can be placed anywhere valid, maximal matching arguments show that play can always continue until no pair of adjacent uncovered squares remains, which is exactly when uncovered squares (if any) are isolated. On a path of even length 2022, there exists a perfect matching of size 1011, covering all squares, so it is possible to reach 0 uncovered squares by some play. Bob tries to minimize the final number of uncovered squares, and whenever Alice makes a move, Bob can always respond while there exists any adjacent uncovered pair. The game continues until there is no such pair; because the underlying graph is a path with a perfect matching and players never pass while a move exists, standard impartial game structure ensures that optimal play allows Bob to drive the game to a perfect matching, leaving 0 uncovered squares. Alice cannot force any uncovered squares, since Bob can always continue to play while moves exist and such a full tiling is reachable. Therefore the greatest number of uncovered squares Alice can guarantee, regardless of Bob, is 0.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
