  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Computing values for a**\n\nI'm calculating values from 2 to 14 to check \\(1+3a^2 \\mod 4\\). If \\(a\\) is even, \\(a^2 \\mod 4 = 0\\), leading to a result of 1, which is not a multiple of 4. Thus, \\(a\\) must be odd. Using candidates greater than 1: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13, I find none work until \\(a=15\\), which gives a perfect square result. Thus, the smallest \\(a>1\\) is 15, and \\(d\\) equals 1!**Finding a polynomial P**\n\nI'm trying to get a polynomial \\(P\\) whose roots are \\(z^2\\). Instead of focusing on \\(P\\) explicitly, I can use a resultant-like approach. If \\(P(x)=0\\), it’s equivalent to finding \\(z\\) such that \\(z^2=x\\) and \\(z^5+2004z-1=0\\). By eliminating \\(z\\) through substitution, I find \\(z\\) in terms of \\(x\\): \\(z = \\frac{1}{(x^2+2004)}\\), resulting in the equation \\(x(x^2+2004)^2 -1=0\\) after verification, leading to a polynomial of degree 5 in \\(x\\).**Determining polynomial characteristics**\n\nI’m identifying the polynomial \\(Q(x) = x^5 + 4008x^3 + 2004^2 x - 1\\) and ensuring it has a degree of 5. The roots \\(z\\) would satisfy \\(Q(x)=0\\), and while multiple \\(z\\) could give the same \\(x\\), that’s not a problem. I’m confirming that \\(P\\) can only be a scalar multiple of \\(Q\\) because \\(P\\) is of unique degree up to scale. Then, I calculate \\(Q(1)\\) and \\(Q(-1)\\). For \\(Q(1)\\), I follow the arithmetic and find it adds up to \\(4,020,024\\); for \\(Q(-1)\\), the result is \\(-4,020,024\\).**Finalizing the fraction**\n\nI calculated the sum and confirmed it is \\(-4,020,026\\) after checking my previous calculation. Then, I computed the ratio of \\(P(1)/P(-1)\\) to get \\(-4,020,024/(-4,020,026)\\). Simplifying involved finding the GCD, which turned out to be 2. Dividing both numbers gives \\(-2,010,012/2,010,013\\). Since \\(2,010,013\\) is odd, the fraction can’t be simplified further. So, my final answer is \\(-2,010,012/2,010,013\\). Now I need to format this as JSON with a clear reasoning field!</think>\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the Pell-type equation 4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1 for positive integers a, b and find the smallest a > 1. Rearranging gives 4b^2 = 1 + 3a^2, so a must be odd. Checking odd a = 3,5,7,9,11,13,15 shows that only a = 15 yields (1 + 3a^2)/4 as a perfect square (169 = 13^2), hence the smallest a > 1 is 15 and d = a - 14 = 1.\\n\\nNext, for the polynomial condition: if z satisfies z^5 + 2004z = 1, then z^5 + 2004z - 1 = 0. Set x = z^2. From z^5 + 2004z - 1 = 0, we get z(z^4 + 2004) = 1. Using x = z^2, z^4 = x^2, so z(x^2 + 2004) = 1, hence z = 1 / (x^2 + 2004). Then x = z^2 = 1 / (x^2 + 2004)^2, which leads to the polynomial equation x(x^2 + 2004)^2 - 1 = 0. Expanding gives a degree-5 polynomial Q(x) = x^5 + 4008x^3 + 2004^2 x - 1. Thus any such polynomial P is a nonzero scalar multiple of Q, so the ratio P(d)/P(-d) equals Q(d)/Q(-d) and is independent of the scalar.\\n\\nCompute 2004^2 = 4,016,016, so Q(x) = x^5 + 4008x^3 + 4,016,016 x - 1. With d = 1, Q(1) = 1 + 4008 + 4,016,016 - 1 = 4,020,024. For -d = -1, Q(-1) = -1 - 4008 - 4,016,016 - 1 = -4,020,026. Therefore P(d)/P(-d) = Q(1)/Q(-1) = 4,020,024 / (-4,020,026) = -4,020,024 / 4,020,026. Dividing numerator and denominator by 2 yields the reduced fraction -2,010,012 / 2,010,013.\\n\\nThus, the value of P(d)/P(-d) is -2010012/2010013.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-2010012/2010013\"\n}",
