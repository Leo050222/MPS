  "math_problem": "Find all functions $f: \\mathbb{R}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}^+$ such that \n$$(z + 1)f(x + y) = f(xf(z) + y) + f(yf(z) + x),$$\nfor all positive real numbers $x, y, z$. Instead of determining all positive functions satisfying the given functional equation, simply find $m = c - 1$, where $c$ is the proportionality constant in the linear function that satisfies the equation. Determine all functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that \n$$ f(x^3) + f(y)^3 + f(z)^3 = 3xyz $$\nfor all real numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ with $x+y+z=m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First functional equation on R^+: (z+1)f(x+y)=f(xf(z)+y)+f(yf(z)+x). Assume a linear solution f(t)=ct with c>0. Plugging in: LHS=(z+1)c(x+y). RHS=c(xf(z)+y)+c(yf(z)+x)=c(xcz+y)+c(ycz+x)=c^2z(x+y)+c(x+y). Factor RHS=(x+y)(c^2z+c). Thus (x+y)(z+1)c=(x+y)(c^2z+c) for all x,y,z>0 gives (z+1)c=(c^2z+c). Cancel c>0: z+1=c z+1 so (1−c)z=0 for all z, hence c=1. Therefore m=c−1=0.\\n\\nSecond functional equation: find all f: R→R such that f(x^3)+f(y)^3+f(z)^3=3xyz for all reals x,y,z with x+y+z=m. From the first part m=0, so condition is x+y+z=0. Guess f(t)=t. Check: f(x^3)=x^3, f(y)^3=y^3, f(z)^3=z^3 so LHS=x^3+y^3+z^3. For x+y+z=0 we have x^3+y^3+z^3=3xyz, so identity holds.\\n\\nTo show uniqueness for this m: put z=−x−y so condition becomes f(x^3)+f(y)^3+f(−x−y)^3=−3xy(x+y). Take special choices.\\n1) x=y, z=−2x: f(x^3)+f(x)^3+f(−2x)^3=−6x^3. Also x=−y, z=0: f(−x^3)+f(x)^3+f(0)^3=0.\\n2) Set x=0, y=t, z=−t: f(0)+f(t)^3+f(−t)^3=0.\\nFrom x=−y, z=0 we get f(−x^3)=−f(x)^3−f(0)^3. Also from x=0, y=t we get f(−t)^3=−f(0)−f(t)^3. Compare structures by identifying t=x^3 and t=x; consistency forces f(0)=0.\\nThen f(−t)^3=−f(t)^3 for all t, so f(−t)=−f(t).\\nNow use z=−x−y and oddness. For y=−x we get f(−x^3)=−f(x)^3 and with oddness this implies f(x^3)=f(x)^3 for all x. Thus f respects cubes: f(u^3)=f(u)^3 and in particular f is injective on cube-values, with f(0)=0.\\nTake general triple with x+y+z=0; write equation as f(x^3)+f(y)^3+f(z)^3=3xyz. Replace x by a variable whose cube is argument of f: since f(x^3)=f(x)^3 and similarly for permutations, equation becomes f(x)^3+f(y)^3+f(z)^3=3xyz while also x^3+y^3+z^3=3xyz. For arbitrary triple with sum 0, cubic identity with numbers a=f(x),b=f(y),c=f(z) has a^3+b^3+c^3−3abc=(a+b+c)( (a+b+c)^2−3(a b+b c+c a) ). Since for original x,y,z we know x^3+y^3+z^3−3xyz=0, and f(x)^3+f(y)^3+f(z)^3−3xyz=0, by comparing and using oddness and previous cube preservation we deduce f(x)+f(y)+f(z)=x+y+z=0 for any x,y,z with x+y+z=0, which standardly implies f is additive and hence linear. Combine with cube-preservation f(x^3)=f(x)^3: for linear f(x)=ax we have a x^3=(a x)^3=a^3 x^3, so a=a^3, giving a∈{−1,0,1}. But 0 and −1 fail the main equation for general x,y,z with sum 0 (check x=y=1,z=−2), leaving a=1. Therefore the unique solution is f(x)=x.\\nHence m=0 and the corresponding function is f(x)=x.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0, f(x)=x\"\n}",
