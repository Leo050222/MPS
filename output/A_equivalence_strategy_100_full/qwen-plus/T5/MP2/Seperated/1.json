Then for any x,\\nf(x² + f(a)) = f(x² + f(b)) ⇒ a + f(x)² = b + f(x)² ⇒ a = b\\nThus f is injective.\\n\\nStep 3: Find a value. Try to find f(0).\\nLet x = 0 in P(0, y):\\nf(0² + f(y)) = y + f(0)² ⇒ f(f(y)) = y + c² where c = f(0)\\nSo f(f(y)) = y + c²  ...(1)\\n\\nThis shows that f is surjective because RHS covers all reals as y varies.\\nAlso, applying f to both sides:\\nf(f(f(y))) = f(y + c²)\\nBut from (1), LHS = f(y + c²)\\nAnd also f(f(f(y))) = f(y) + c²\\nSo f(y + c²) = f(y) + c²\\nThus f is additive with respect to c²: f(y + c²) = f(y) + c²\\nSo f is periodic-like in increments, actually Cauchy-type.\\n\\nNow use P(x, y) and (1).\\nFrom (1): f(f(y)) = y + c²\\nSet y = 0 in original equation:\\nP(x, 0): f(x² + f(0)) = 0 + f(x)² ⇒ f(x² + c) = f(x)²\\nSo f(x)² = f(x² + c)  ...(2)\\n\\nNow go back to P(0, y): f(f(y)) = y + c²\\nNow try to find c.\\nSet x = 0 in (2): f(0)² = f(0 + c) = f(c)\\nBut f(0) = c, so c² = f(c)\\nBut from (1), f(f(0)) = 0 + c² ⇒ f(c) = c²\\nWhich matches — consistent.\\n\\nNow use injectivity.\\nTry to find if f is odd or even.\\nUse symmetry.\\nWe have f(f(y)) = y + c²\\nApply f to both sides:\\nf(f(f(y))) = f(y + c²)\\nBut f(f(f(y))) = f(y) + c² (by replacing y with f(y) in (1))\\nSo f(y + c²) = f(y) + c²\\nSo f is additive with step c²: f(z + c²) = f(z) + c² for all z\\n\\nNow recall from (2): f(x)² = f(x² + c)\\nLet us suppose c = 0. Try this case.\\nAssume f(0) = c = 0.\\nThen (1): f(f(y)) = y\\nAnd (2): f(x²) = f(x)²\\nNow P(x, y): f(x² + f(y)) = y + f(x)² = y + f(x²)\\nBut since f(f(y)) = y, set z = f(y), then y = f(z)\\nSo f(x² + z) = f(z) + f(x²)\\nSo f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) whenever a ≥ 0 (since x² ≥ 0)\\nBut we can get more.\\nActually, for any z and a = x² ≥ 0, f(a + z) = f(a) + f(z)\\nSo f is additive on [0, ∞) translated.\\nBut since f(f(y)) = y, f is bijective.\\nNow, f(x²) = f(x)² ≥ 0? Not necessarily, but f(x)² is always ≥ 0, so f(x²) ≥ 0 for all x.\\nAlso, since f is additive in first argument when one is non-negative square, but let’s see.\\nActually, for fixed z, f(x² + z) = f(x²) + f(z)\\nSo f is additive with respect to non-negative arguments.\\nMoreover, since every real number can be written as difference of two squares? Not quite, but perhaps we can extend.\\nAssume f is additive everywhere.\\nWe have f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) for a ≥ 0? Not exactly, only when a is a square.\\nBut squares span densely?\\nAlternatively, define g(x) = f(x) - kx or something.\\nBut try to plug into original.\\nWe have f(f(y)) = y, so f is an involution up to itself.\\nAlso, f(x²) = f(x)²\\nNow let us consider P(x, f(y)):\\nf(x² + f(f(y))) = f(y) + f(x)² ⇒ f(x² + y) = f(y) + f(x)² = f(y) + f(x²)\\nSo f(x² + y) = f(x²) + f(y) for all x, y\\nSince x² can be any non-negative real, say a ≥ 0, then f(a + y) = f(a) + f(y) for all y ∈ R, a ≥ 0\\nNow fix a ≥ 0, this says f is additive in the second variable.\\nNow let us show full additivity.\\nTake any real u, v.\\nWe want f(u+v) = f(u) + f(v)\\nCase 1: u ≥ 0: then f(u + v) = f(u) + f(v) by above.\\nCase 2: u < 0. Then write u + v = v + u. If v ≥ 0, then f(v + u) = f(v) + f(u). So still works.\\nIf both u < 0 and v < 0, then u + v < 0.\\nBut pick a large a ≥ 0 such that a + u ≥ 0.\\nThen f(a + u + v) = f((a + u) + v)\\nNow a + u ≥ 0, so f((a + u) + v) = f(a + u) + f(v) = [f(a) + f(u)] + f(v)\\nBut also f(a + (u + v)) = f(a) + f(u + v)\\nSo f(a) + f(u + v) = f(a) + f(u) + f(v)\\n⇒ f(u + v) = f(u) + f(v)\\nThus f is additive on R.\\nSo f(u + v) = f(u) + f(v) for all u, v ∈ R\\nAlso, f(f(y)) = y\\nAnd f(x²) = f(x)²\\nNow since f is additive and f(x²) = f(x)², and assuming regularity (like continuity, or boundedness), f(x) = x or f(x) = 0, but f(f(y))=y rules out f=0.\\nBut we don’t have continuity.\\nHowever, f(x²) = f(x)² and f additive.\\nLet us show f is linear.\\nFor rationals: f(q) = q f(1) for rational q, by additivity.\\nLet a = f(1)\\nThen f(q) = a q for q ∈ Q\\nNow f(f(q)) = q ⇒ f(a q) = q\\nBut f(a q) = a f(q) = a (a q) = a² q\\nSo a² q = q for all q ∈ Q ⇒ a² = 1 ⇒ a = ±1\\nSo f(q) = q or f(q) = -q for all rational q\\nNow check which works.\\nFirst, suppose f(q) = q for all q ∈ Q\\nThen f(f(y)) = y, so f is an involution.\\nNow f(x²) = f(x)²\\nSuppose f(x) = x for all x? Try.\\nCheck functional equation:\\nf(x² + f(y)) = f(x² + y) = x² + y\\nRHS: y + f(x)² = y + x²\\nEqual. So identity works.\\nNow try f(x) = -x\\nThen f(f(y)) = f(-y) = -(-y) = y, good.\\nf(x²) = -x²\\nf(x)² = (-x)² = x²\\nBut f(x²) = -x² ≠ x² unless x=0. So not equal.\\nSo f(x) = -x does not satisfy f(x²) = f(x)²\\nSo only possibility for rationals is f(q)=q\\nBut we need for all reals.\\nNow, is f(x) = x the only solution?\\nSuppose there is another additive function satisfying f(f(x))=x and f(x²)=f(x)²\\nBut without continuity, pathological solutions exist?\\nBut we have f(x²) = f(x)² ≥ 0? No, f(x)² is always ≥ 0, so f(x²) ≥ 0\\nBut x² ≥ 0, so f maps [0,∞) to [0,∞)? Not necessarily, but f(x²) ≥ 0\\nNow suppose f is additive and f(x²) = f(x)²\\nLet us show f is linear.\\nNote that for any x, f(x)^2 = f(x^2)\\nNow let us consider x=√2\\nLet a = f(√2)\\nThen f( (√2)^2 ) = f(2) = 2 (since 2∈Q, f(2)=2)\\nBut f(√2)^2 = a²\\nSo a² = 2 ⇒ a = √2 or -√2\\nSimilarly, for any algebraic number?\\nBut f must satisfy f(f(x)) = x\\nSo f(a) = f(f(√2)) = √2\\nSo f(√2) = a, f(a) = √2\\nBut a² = 2, so a = ±√2\\nIf a = √2, then f(√2)=√2, good.\\nIf a = -√2, then f(√2) = -√2, then f(a) = f(-√2) = -f(√2) = -(-√2) = √2, which equals required f(f(√2)) = √2, so okay.\\nBut now check f(x²) = f(x)²\\nFor x=√2: f((√2)^2)=f(2)=2\\nf(√2)^2 = (-√2)^2 = 2, good.\\nBut now check consistency.\\nNow what about f(√2 + √3)?\\nBut we need to satisfy additivity.\\nf(√2 + √3) = f(√2) + f(√3)\\nLet b = f(√3)\\nThen b² = f(√3)^2 = f( (√3)^2 ) = f(3) = 3 ⇒ b = ±√3\\nSimilarly.\\nNow f(f(√3)) = √3\\nIf b = √3, f(b)=f(√3)=b=√3, good.\\nIf b = -√3, f(b)=f(-√3)= -f(√3) = -(-√3)=√3, good.\\nSo possible to choose signs.\\nBut now check functional equation.\\nTry to plug into original.\\nSuppose f(√2) = -√2, f(√3) = -√3, etc.\\nBut now compute f(x² + f(y))\\nTake x=0, y arbitrary: f(f(y)) = y + f(0)^2\\nBut earlier we assumed f(0)=c\\nIn this branch we assumed c=0?\\nWait — we were exploring c=0 case.\\nRecall: we assumed f(0)=0 to get f(f(y))=y\\nBut earlier we had general c.\\nBacktrack.\\nWe had f(f(y)) = y + c², c=f(0)\\nAnd f(y + c²) = f(y) + c²\\nNow if c ≠ 0, can we get a solution?\\nSuppose c ≠ 0.\\nFrom earlier: f(x)² = f(x² + c)  ...(2)\\nAnd f(f(y)) = y + c²\\nNow set y such that f(y) = 0. Does such y exist?\\nSince f is surjective (because f(f(y)) covers all reals shifted), yes, exists y0 with f(y0)=0\\nThen P(x, y0): f(x² + f(y0)) = y0 + f(x)² ⇒ f(x²) = y0 + f(x)²\\nBut from (2): f(x)² = f(x² + c)\\nSo f(x²) = y0 + f(x² + c)\\nNot obviously helpful.\\nSet x=0 in P(x,y): already did, f(f(y)) = y + c²\\nNow set y = 0 in P(x,y): f(x² + c) = f(x)²\\nNow suppose we let x=0 in this: f(0 + c) = f(0)² ⇒ f(c) = c²\\nBut earlier from f(f(0)) = f(c) = 0 + c² = c², same.\\nNow try to find f at other points.\\nAssume f is linear: f(x) = kx + b\\nBut f: R→R\\nf(0) = b = c\\nf(f(y)) = f(ky + b) = k(ky + b) + b = k²y + kb + b\\nSet equal to y + b²\\nSo k²y + kb + b = y + b² for all y\\nThus k² = 1, and kb + b = b²\\nCase 1: k=1\\nThen b + b = b² ⇒ 2b = b² ⇒ b² - 2b = 0 ⇒ b(b-2)=0 ⇒ b=0 or b=2\\nCase 2: k=-1\\nThen -b + b = 0 = b² ⇒ b=0\\nSo possible: (k,b) = (1,0), (1,2), (-1,0)\\nNow test each.\\nFirst: f(x) = x (k=1,b=0)\\nThen LHS: f(x² + f(y)) = f(x² + y) = x² + y\\nRHS: y + f(x)² = y + x²\\nEqual. Good.\\nSecond: f(x) = x + 2\\nThen f(f(y)) = f(y+2) = y+2+2 = y+4\\nBut should be y + c² = y + 4 (c=f(0)=2), so y+4, good.\\nNow check main equation:\\nLHS: f(x² + f(y)) = f(x² + (y+2)) = (x² + y + 2) + 2 = x² + y + 4\\nRHS: y + f(x)² = y + (x+2)² = y + x² + 4x + 4\\nEqual only if 4x=0 for all x, false.\\nSo not work.\\nThird: f(x) = -x\\nThen f(0)=0=c\\nf(f(y)) = f(-y) = -(-y) = y = y + 0, good.\\nf(x)² = (-x)² = x²\\nf(x² + c) = f(x²) = -x²\\nBut should equal f(x)² = x²\\nSo -x² = x² ⇒ x=0, not true.\\nSo only f(x)=x works among linear.\\nBut earlier we thought about f(x)=-x not working.\\nNow back to c≠0 case.\\nWe had f(y + c²) = f(y) + c²\\nAnd f(x)² = f(x² + c)\\nNow suppose we try to set x such that x² + c = 0, but may not be real.\\nAssume c² = d >0\\nThen f(y + d) = f(y) + d\\nSo f is periodic with additive increase.\\nNow from f(f(y)) = y + d\\nApply f: f(f(f(y))) = f(y + d) = f(y) + d\\nBut f(f(f(y))) = f(y) + d, same.\\nNow let us consider the range.\\nSuppose there is a solution with c≠0.\\nTry to find contradiction.\\nSet y = -d in f(f(y)) = y + d ⇒ f(f(-d)) = -d + d = 0\\nSo f(f(-d)) = 0\\nLet a = f(-d), so f(a) = 0\\nNow use P(x, y) with y such that f(y)=0, i.e., y=a\\nP(x,a): f(x² + f(a)) = a + f(x)² ⇒ f(x² + 0) = a + f(x)² ⇒ f(x²) = a + f(x)²\\nBut from earlier: f(x)² = f(x² + c)\\nSo f(x²) = a + f(x² + c)\\nLet z = x² ≥ 0, so for all z≥0, f(z) = a + f(z + c)\\nBut c = f(0), and d = c²\\nSo f(z) - f(z + c) = a for all z≥0\\nBut also, from earlier, f(z + d) = f(z) + d\\nNow iterate: f(z + c) = f(z) - a\\nf(z + 2c) = f(z + c) - a = f(z) - 2a\\n...\\nf(z + kc) = f(z) - k a\\nBut also, if c ≠ 0, as k increases, z + kc → ±∞\\nBut f(z + kc) = f(z) - k a\\nNow apply the shift by d: f(w + d) = f(w) + d\\nSo f is unbounded in both directions if a ≠ 0, but could be.\\nBut now combine.\\nSuppose c ≠ 0.\\nThen d = c² > 0\\nNow f(z + d) = f(z) + d\\nBut d = c², so express in terms of c.\\nNow from f(z + c) = f(z) - a\\nThen f(z + 2c) = f(z) - 2a\\n...\\nf(z + k c) = f(z) - k a\\nNow set k such that k c ≈ m d for integer m\\nBut d = c², so k c = m c² ⇒ k = m c\\nSo if c is irrational, messy.\\nAssume c is rational? Not necessarily.\\nNote that f(z + n d) = f(z) + n d for any integer n\\nBut d = c²\\nAlso, f(z + k c) = f(z) - k a\\nNow set z + k c = w, then f(w) = f(w - k c) - k a\\nBut w - k c = z\\nNot helpful.\\nSuppose we go to large n.\\nConsider f at point z + n d = z + n c²\\nf(z + n c²) = f(z) + n c²\\nBut also, if we write n c² as multiple of c, it's (n c) * c, so if n c is integer, say, but not.\\nUnless c is rational.\\nSuppose c is rational, say c = p/q\\nBut too many cases.\\nInstead, let us use the fact that f(x)² = f(x² + c)\\nLeft side ≥ 0, so f(x² + c) ≥ 0 for all x\\nAs x varies, x² + c ≥ c, so f(t) ≥ 0 for all t ≥ c\\nSimilarly, from f(z) = a + f(z + c) for z≥0\\nSo f(z) = f(z + c) + a\\nSince z + c > z ≥ 0, and if c>0, z+c > c, so f(z+c) ≥ 0, so f(z) ≥ a\\nBut z≥0, so for all z≥0, f(z) ≥ a\\nBut also, f(z) = f(z + c) + a ≥ 0 + a = a, same.\\nNow from f(z + c) = f(z) - a\\nAnd f(z + c) ≥ 0 if z + c ≥ c, i.e., z ≥ 0, which is true, so f(z + c) ≥ 0\\nThus f(z) - a ≥ 0 ⇒ f(z) ≥ a\\nAgain same.\\nNow if a > 0, then f(z) ≥ a > 0 for all z≥0\\nBut f(z + c) = f(z) - a, so decreases by a each time we add c\\nSo f(z + k c) = f(z) - k a\\nFor large k, this becomes negative\\nBut when z + k c ≥ c, we must have f(z + k c) ≥ 0\\nContradiction when k > f(z)/a\\nSimilarly, if a < 0, then f(z) = f(z + c) + a < f(z + c) since a<0\\nBut f(z + c) ≥ 0, so f(z) < f(z + c)\\nBut from f(z + c) = f(z) - a, and a<0, -a>0, so f(z + c) = f(z) + |a| > f(z), consistent.\\nBut f(z) = f(z + c) + a = f(z + c) - |a|\\nSo f(z) < f(z + c)\\nBut as k increases, f(z + k c) = f(z) - k a = f(z) + k |a| → ∞\\nNo problem.\\nBut we also have f(w + d) = f(w) + d\\nNow d = c² >0\\nNow consider the sequence w_k = z + k c\\nf(w_k) = f(z) - k a\\nBut also, f(w_k + d) = f(w_k) + d\\nBut w_k + d = z + k c + c²\\nf(w_k + d) = f(z + k c + c²)\\nThis should equal f(w_k) + d = f(z) - k a + c²\\nBut also, if we think of it as a point, we can write it in terms of the c-step.\\nNote that the function has two periods: one additive with c, but not periodic, rather arithmetic sequence.\\nThe values on the arithmetic progression {z + k c} decrease linearly if a>0, but must be ≥0 for large argument, contradiction unless a≤0.\\nEarlier if a>0, f(z + k c) = f(z) - k a → -∞ as k→∞, but for large k, z + k c ≥ c, so f(z + k c) ≥ 0, contradiction.\\nThus a ≤ 0\\nSimilarly, if a < 0, f(z + k c) = f(z) - k a = f(z) + k |a| → ∞ as k→∞, no contradiction.\\nBut we also have the d-shift: f(w + d) = f(w) + d\\nNow d = c²\\nNow consider f at points differing by d.\\nBut the c-sequence has step c, d = c²\\nThe ratio d/c = c, so if c is irrational, the sequences are dense modulo something, but complicated.\\nAssume c ≠ 0, and try to find value.\\nGo back to f(x²) = a + f(x)² from earlier, where a = f(-d) and d=c²\\nBut f(x)² = f(x² + c)\\nSo f(x²) = a + f(x² + c)\\nLet u = x² ≥ 0, so f(u) = a + f(u + c) for all u≥0\\nThus f(u + c) = f(u) - a\\nSince a ≤ 0, let b = -a ≥ 0, so f(u + c) = f(u) + b\\nWith b ≥ 0\\nNow f(u + c) = f(u) + b\\nThen f(u + 2c) = f(u + c) + b = f(u) + 2b\\n...\\nf(u + k c) = f(u) + k b\\nNow since u ≥ 0, and c = f(0), could be positive or negative.\\nAssume c > 0 (since c² = d > 0, c ≠ 0, so c > 0 or c < 0; assume c > 0 wlog? But f(0)=c, could be negative.\\nSet c > 0 for now.\\nThen as k → ∞, u + k c → ∞, f(u + k c) = f(u) + k b → ∞ if b > 0, or constant if b=0.\\nBut also, f(v + d) = f(v) + d for all v, with d = c² > 0\\nSo f is strictly increasing by d every d units.\\nNow compare growth rates.\\nAlong the sequence v_n = u + n c, f(v_n) = f(u) + n b\\nThe increment per step c is b\\nThe average slope is b / c\\nAlong the d-shift, every d units, increase by d, so slope 1\\nFor consistency, the asymptotic slope should match, so b/c = 1, i.e., b = c\\nBut b = -a, a = f(-d)\\nNow also, from f(f(y)) = y + d\\nThe function f must grow like y, since f(f(y)) ~ y\\nBut here, along some sequences, f grows linearly with slope b/c\\nIf b/c ≠ 1, then f grows at different rate, might contradict bijectivity or the functional equation.\\nSuppose b = c\\nThen f(u + c) = f(u) + c\\nBut earlier f(v + d) = f(v) + d = f(v) + c²\\nNow d = c²\\nNow is this consistent?\\nf(u + c) = f(u) + c\\nThen f(u + 2c) = f(u) + 2c\\n...\\nf(u + k c) = f(u) + k c\\nNow f(u + c²) = f(u) + c * c = f(u) + c²\\nBut from the other equation, f(u + c²) = f(u) + c²\\nSame! So consistent when b = c\\nSo if b = c, i.e., -a = c, so a = -c\\nRecall a = f(-d) = f(-c²)\\nSo f(-c²) = -c\\nNow we have f(u + c) = f(u) + c for u ≥ 0\\nBut we need for all real u?\\nEarlier derivation was for u ≥ 0\\nNow can we extend?\\nFrom the functional equation, perhaps.\\nWe also have f(x)² = f(x² + c)\\nAnd f(f(y)) = y + c²\\nNow let us try to find f at specific points.\\nSet x=0: f(f(y)) = y + c²\\nSet y=0: f(x² + c) = f(x)²\\nNow suppose we assume f is linear, but we tried.\\nOr perhaps f(x) = x + k\\nBut earlier didn't work except k=0.\\nAnother idea: suppose f(x) = x + c\\nThen f(0) = c, good.\\nf(f(y)) = f(y + c) = y + c + c = y + 2c\\nSet equal to y + c², so 2c = c² ⇒ c² - 2c =0 ⇒ c(c-2)=0\\nSo c=0 or c=2\\nc=0 we know, f(x)=x\\nc=2: f(x)=x+2\\nBut earlier we tried and it failed.\\nIndeed, LHS: f(x² + f(y)) = f(x² + y + 2) = x² + y + 2 + 2 = x² + y + 4\\nRHS: y + f(x)² = y + (x+2)² = y + x² + 4x + 4\\nNot equal.\\nSuppose f(x) = -x + c\\nf(0)=c\\nf(f(y)) = f(-y + c) = -(-y + c) + c = y - c + c = y\\nSet equal to y + c², so y = y + c² ⇒ c=0\\nThen f(x)=-x, which we saw doesn't work.\\nPerhaps f(x) = x for x ≥ some value, but hard.\\nBack to our case.\\nWe have for u ≥ 0, f(u + c) = f(u) + c\\nAnd f(u + c²) = f(u) + c²\\nNow let us find f(c)\\nc = f(0)\\nf(c) = c², as earlier.\\nNow f(c) = f(0 + c) = f(0) + c = c + c = 2c? Only if the formula extends to u=0\\nu≥0 includes u=0, so f(0 + c) = f(0) + c ⇒ f(c) = c + c = 2c\\nBut also f(c) = c²\\nSo 2c = c² ⇒ c² - 2c =0 ⇒ c(c-2)=0\\nSo c=0 or c=2\\nc=0 we have solution f(x)=x\\nc=2: then f(c)=f(2)=c²=4, and also 2c=4, good.\\nNow check if possible.\\nc=2, d=c²=4\\nf(f(y)) = y + 4\\nf(x)² = f(x² + 2)\\nAnd for u≥0, f(u + 2) = f(u) + 2\\nAlso f(-d) = f(-4) = a = -c = -2\\nNow f(x² + 2) = f(x)² ≥ 0, so f(t) ≥ 0 for t ≥ 2\\nNow f(u + 2) = f(u) + 2 for u≥0\\nSo f(2) = f(0+2) = f(0)+2=2+2=4\\nf(4) = f(2+2) = f(2)+2=4+2=6\\nf(6)=f(4+2)=6+2=8, etc.\\nf(1): unknown yet.\\nBut f(1² + 2) = f(3) = f(1)²\\nf(3): 3≥0, f(3)=f(1+2)=f(1)+2\\nSo f(1)+2 = f(1)²\\nLet z = f(1), then z² - z - 2 =0 ⇒ (z-2)(z+1)=0 ⇒ z=2 or z=-1\\nNow similarly, f(0)=2, f(2)=4, f(4)=6, f(6)=8, so seems f(even) = even + 2? f(0)=2, f(2)=4, f(4)=6, f(6)=8, so f(2k)=2k+2 for k=0,1,2,3\\nSimilarly, f(3)=f(1)+2, and if f(1)=2, f(3)=4; if f(1)=-1, f(3)=1\\nNow f(f(y)) = y + 4\\nTry y=0: f(f(0)) = f(2) = 4 = 0 + 4, good.\\ny=1: f(f(1)) = 1 + 4 = 5\\nIf f(1)=2, f(2)=4 ≠5\\nIf f(1)=-1, f(-1)=5\\nNow f(-1): unknown.\\nNow y=2: f(f(2)) = f(4) = 6 = 2 + 4, good.\\ny=3: f(f(3)) = 3+4=7\\nIf f(1)=-1, f(3)=1, so f(1)=7? But f(1)=-1, contradiction.\\nIf f(1)=2, f(3)=4, f(4)=6≠7, contradiction.\\nBoth fail.\\nf(f(3)) should be 7.\\nIf f(1)=2, f(3)=4, f(4)=6≠7\\nIf f(1)=-1, f(3)=1, f(1)=-1≠7\\nSo neither works.\\nThus c=2 not possible.\\nTherefore only c=0 is possible.\\nSo f(0)=0\\nThen f(f(y)) = y\\nAnd f(x²) = f(x)²\\nAnd f is additive: f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b) for all a,b\\nAnd f(f(x))=x\\nAnd f(x²)=f(x)²\\nNow as before, f is additive involution and f(x²)=f(x)²\\nNow for any x, f(x)^2 = f(x^2)\\nSince f is additive and f(f(x))=x, f is bijective.\\nNow let us show f(x)=x for all x.\\nSuppose not. Suppose there is x such that f(x) ≠ x\\nBut from earlier, for rationals, f(q)=q\\nNow for irrationals.\\nLet x be real.\\nThen f(x)^2 = f(x^2)\\nApply f: f(f(x)^2) = f(f(x^2)) = x^2\\nBut f(f(x)^2) = ? \\nSince f is additive, and f(q)=q for q rational, and if we assume continuity, f(x)=x\\nBut without continuity, are there pathological solutions?\\nSuppose f is not continuous. Then there are additive functions not linear.\\nBut we have f(f(x))=x and f(x^2)=f(x)^2\\nNow let us consider x=√2\\nLet a = f(√2)\\nThen a^2 = f(√2)^2 = f( (√2)^2 ) = f(2) = 2\\nSo a = √2 or a = -√2\\nNow f(a) = f(f(√2)) = √2\\nIf a = √2, f(√2)=√2\\nIf a = -√2, f(-√2) = √2\\nBut f is additive, so f(-√2) = -f(√2) = -(-√2) = √2, good.\\nNow similarly for √3: f(√3) = b, b^2=3, b=±√3, f(b)=√3\\nNow consider √6 = √2 √3\\nf(√6) = f(√2 √3)\\nBut we don't have multiplicative property.\\nNote that (√2 + √3)^2 = 2 + 2√6 + 3 = 5 + 2√6\\nf( (√2 + √3)^2 ) = f(5 + 2√6) = f(5) + f(2√6) = 5 + 2 f(√6)  (since f additive, f(2x)=2f(x))\\nOn the other hand, f(√2 + √3)^2 = [f(√2) + f(√3)]^2\\nLet A = f(√2), B = f(√3), C = f(√6)\\nf(√2 + √3) = A + B\\nSo [A + B]^2 = A^2 + 2AB + B^2 = 2 + 2AB + 3 = 5 + 2AB\\nBut this equals f( (√2 + √3)^2 ) = 5 + 2C\\nSo 5 + 2AB = 5 + 2C ⇒ AB = C\\nBut C = f(√6), and AB = f(√2) f(√3)\\nSo f(√2) f(√3) = f(√6)\\nSimilarly, for any such, f preserves products of square roots.\\nBut √6 = √2 √3, so f(√2 √3) = f(√2) f(√3)\\nNow if f(√2) = √2, f(√3) = √3, then f(√6) = √2 √3 = √6\\nIf f(√2) = -√2, f(√3) = √3, then f(√6) = (-√2)(√3) = -√6\\nBut also f(√6) must satisfy f(√6)^2 = f(6) = 6, so f(√6) = ±√6\\nHere -√6, good.\\nAnd f(f(√6)) = f(-√6) = -f(√6) = -(-√6) = √6, good.\\nNow check the functional equation.\\nTake x=√2, y=0\\nP(√2, 0): f( (√2)^2 + f(0) ) = 0 + f(√2)^2 ⇒ f(2 + 0) = f(√2)^2 ⇒ f(2) = A^2 = 2, good.\\nNow take x=1, y arbitrary\\nP(1,y): f(1 + f(y)) = y + f(1)^2 = y + 1^2 = y + 1\\nSince f(1)=1\\nNow f(1 + f(y)) = y + 1\\nApply f to both sides: f(f(1 + f(y))) = f(y + 1)\\nLeft: 1 + f(y), since f(f(z))=z\\nRight: f(y+1)\\nSo 1 + f(y) = f(y+1)\\nBut since f is additive, f(y+1) = f(y) + f(1) = f(y) + 1\\nSo 1 + f(y) = f(y) + 1, always true.\\nNow take x=√2, y such that f(y)=0\\nf(y)=0, then f(f(y))=f(0)=0=y, so y=0\\nSo only y=0 has f(y)=0\\nNow take x=√2, y=3\\nP(√2,3): f( (√2)^2 + f(3) ) = 3 + f(√2)^2 ⇒ f(2 + f(3)) = 3 + A^2 = 3 + 2 = 5\\nf(3)=3, since 3 rational, so f(2+3)=f(5)=5\\n5=5, good.\\nNow suppose we have f(√2) = -√2, f(√3) = -√3, then f(√6) = (-√2)(-√3) = √6\\nNow take x=√2, y=√3\\nP(x,y): f(x² + f(y)) = y + f(x)^2\\nx² = 2, f(y) = f(√3) = -√3\\nSo left: f(2 + (-√3)) = f(2 - √3)\\nf(2 - √3) = f(2) + f(-√3) = 2 - f(√3) = 2 - (-√3) = 2 + √3\\nRight: y + f(x)^2 = √3 + (-√2)^2 = √3 + 2\\nSo 2 + √3 = 2 + √3, good.\\nOh! It works.\\nIs that possible?\\nf(2 - √3) = 2 + √3?\\nBut 2 - √3 ≈ 2 - 1.732 = 0.268\\nf(0.268) = 2 + 1.732 = 3.732\\nBut is this consistent with additivity?\\nf is supposed to be additive.\\nf(2 - √3) = f(2) + f(-√3) = 2 + (-f(√3)) = 2 - (-√3) = 2 + √3, yes.\\nAnd right side is √3 + 2, same.\\nNow check f(f(y)) for y=√3: f(f(√3)) = f(-√3) = -f(√3) = -(-√3) = √3 = y, good.\\nNow what about another point, say √8 = 2√2\\nf(√8) = f(2√2) = 2 f(√2) = 2*(-√2) = -2√2\\nf(√8)^2 = (-2√2)^2 = 8\\nf( (√8)^2 ) = f(8) = 8, good.\\nf(f(√8)) = f(-2√2) = -2 f(√2) = -2*(-√2) = 2√2 = √8, good.\\nNow is there a conflict?\\nConsider x=√8, y=0\\nP(√8,0): f(8 + f(0)) = 0 + f(√8)^2 ⇒ f(8) = (-2√2)^2 = 8, and f(8)=8, good.\\nNow seems consistent.\\nBut is f additive? f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b)\\nFor example, f(√2 + √3) = f(√2) + f(√3) = -√2 - √3\\nf( (√2 + √3)^2 ) = f(5 + 2√6) = f(5) + f(2√6) = 5 + 2 f(√6)\\nEarlier we had f(√6) = f(√2) f(√3) = (-√2)(-√3) = √6\\nSo f(5 + 2√6) = 5 + 2*√6\\nOn the other hand, f(√2 + √3)^2 = [-√2 - √3]^2 = (√2 + √3)^2 = 2 + 2√6 + 3 = 5 + 2√6\\nAnd f( (√2 + √3)^2 ) should equal f(√2 + √3)^2, which is 5 + 2√6, and we have 5 + 2√6, good.\\nNow the functional equation: P(x,y) for x=√2, y=√3: we did, worked.\\nBut is this defined for all reals? We need to define f on a basis.\\nActually, f is determined by its values on a Hamel basis.\\nBut we have the condition f(f(x))=x and f(x^2)=f(x)^2\\nIn this case, for each 'independent' irrational, we can choose sign.\\nBut f(f(x))=x constrains it.\\nFor example, if I set f(√2) = -√2, then f(-√2) = -f(√2) = -(-√2) = √2, and f(f(√2)) = f(-√2) = √2, good.\\nSimilarly for others.\\nBut what about √2 + 1? f(√2 + 1) = f(√2) + f(1) = -√2 + 1\\nf(f(√2 + 1)) = f(1 - √2) = f(1) + f(-√2) = 1 + √2\\nBut should be √2 + 1, same as 1 + √2, good.\\nf( (√2 + 1)^2 ) = f(2 + 2√2 + 1) = f(3 + 2√2) = 3 + 2 f(√2) = 3 + 2*(-√2) = 3 - 2√2\\nf(√2 + 1)^2 = (1 - √2)^2 = 1 - 2√2 + 2 = 3 - 2√2, good.\\nSo it works.\\nBut is this satisfying the original equation for all x,y?\\nTake x=1, y=√2\\nP(1, √2): f(1^2 + f(√2)) = √2 + f(1)^2 ⇒ f(1 + (-√2)) = √2 + 1^2 ⇒ f(1 - √2) = √2 + 1\\nNow f(1 - √2) = f(1) + f(-√2) = 1 + √2\\nAnd √2 + 1 = 1 + √2, good.\\nAnother: x=√2, y=1\\nP(√2,1): f(2 + f(1)) = 1 + f(√2)^2 ⇒ f(2+1) = 1 + (-√2)^2 ⇒ f(3) = 1 + 2 = 3, and f(3)=3, good.\\nSo it seems to work.\\nBut is f mapping R to R? Yes.\\nAnd we have infinitely many such functions, depending on the choice of signs for each 'basis' element.\\nBut the problem asks to find all functions.\\nHowever, in the functional equation, we have f(x^2 + f(y)) = y + f(x)^2\\nWith f additive, f(f(y))=y, f(x^2)=f(x)^2\\nBut in the case where f(√2) = -√2, etc., it seems to work.\\nBut let's check the range.\\nf(y) can be negative, etc.\\nBut in the expression x^2 + f(y), it could be anything.\\nBut in our calculation, it worked for the points we checked.\\nHowever, is f really additive? In the construction, if we define f on a Hamel basis, assigning f(b_i) = ± b_i or something, but we need f(f(x))=x.\\nSuppose we have a Hamel basis including 1, √2, √3, etc.\\nFor each basis element b_i, we can set f(b_i) = c_i, but then f(f(b_i)) = f(c_i) must be b_i\\nAnd c_i must be in the span, and f(c_i) = b_i\\nAlso f(b_i^2) = f(b_i)^2, but b_i^2 may not be in basis.\\nFor example, if b_i = √2, b_i^2 = 2, which is rational, f(2)=2, f(b_i)^2 = c_i^2, so c_i^2 = 2, so c_i = ±√2\\nThen f(c_i) = f(±√2) = ± f(√2) = ± c_i\\nBut f(f(√2)) = f(c_i) = ± c_i, and this should be √2\\nSo if c_i = √2, f(c_i) = f(√2) = √2, good.\\nIf c_i = -√2, f(c_i) = f(-√2) = -f(√2) = -(-√2) = √2, good.\\nSimilarly for other basis elements that are square roots.\\nBut for a basis element like π, f(π) = d, then f(d) = π, and f(π^2) = f(π)^2 = d^2\\nf(π^2) is determined by the basis representation of π^2.\\nπ^2 is another real, so in the Hamel basis, it has a representation.\\nFor f(π^2) to equal d^2, it may not hold unless we choose carefully.\\nFor example, if π is in basis, π^2 may be linearly independent, so f(π^2) is chosen independently, but we need f(π^2) = f(π)^2 = d^2\\nSo we must set f(π^2) = d^2\\nBut d = f(π), and f(π^2) must be assigned.\\nAlso f(f(π)) = f(d) = π\\nSo we need to ensure that in the basis, the values are consistent.\\nThis might be possible by including all necessary elements, but it's complicated.\\nHowever, for the functional equation to hold, we need f(x^2) = f(x)^2 for all x, which is a strong condition.\\nIn particular, for x=π, f(π^2) = f(π)^2\\nBut if π and π^2 are linearly independent over Q, then f(π) and f(π^2) can be chosen, but they are linked.\\nSuppose we set f(π) = d, then f(π^2) must be d^2\\nBut d^2 may not be in the span or may conflict.\\nMoreover, f(f(π)) = f(d) = π\\nSo f(d) = π\\nNow d = f(π), so f(f(π)) = π, good.\\nBut d is some real number, and f(d) = π\\nNow if d is not in the span of the basis in a way that conflicts.\\nTo make it work, we can include in the Hamel basis all numbers like π, π^2, etc., but it's infinite.\\nPerhaps the only global solution is f(x)=x.\\nBecause if we want f(x^2) = f(x)^2 and f additive, and f(f(x))=x, perhaps only identity.\\nSuppose f(x) = x for all x.\\nWorks.\\nSuppose f is not identity.\\nLet S be the set where f(x) = x.\\nContains Q.\\nSuppose there is x not in S, f(x) = y ≠ x.\\nThen f(y) = f(f(x)) = x\\nSo f swaps x and y.\\nNow f(x^2) = f(x)^2 = y^2\\nBut also f(x^2) = z, say, and f(z) = x^2\\nBut f(x^2) = y^2, so z = y^2, and f(y^2) = x^2\\nBut also f(y^2) = f(y)^2 = x^2, good.\\nNow for x+1, f(x+1) = f(x) + f(1) = y + 1\\nf(f(x+1)) = f(y+1) = f(y) + f(1) = x + 1, good.\\nf((x+1)^2) = f(x^2 + 2x +1) = f(x^2) + 2f(x) + f(1) = y^2 + 2y + 1 = (y+1)^2\\nAnd f(x+1)^2 = (y+1)^2, good.\\nSo locally it works.\\nBut for the function to be well-defined, and additive, it might be possible if we have a basis where we pair elements.\\nHowever, the condition f(x^2) = f(x)^2 may force f to be the identity on a generating set.\\nAfter research, it's known that the only solutions are f(x)=x and possibly f(x)=-x, but f(x)=-x doesn't work as we saw.\\nIn this case, f(x)=-x gives f(x^2) = -x^2, f(x)^2 = x^2, not equal.\\nFor the sign-change on square roots, it might work if we do it consistently, but for numbers like π, it's problematic.\\nPerhaps the only continuous solution is f(x)=x, and the problem likely expects that.\\nIn most olympiad problems, they expect the nice solution.\\nMoreover, in the beginning, when we have f(f(y)) = y, and f(x^2) = f(x)^2, and additivity, and if we assume f is continuous, then f(x)=x.\\nWithout continuity, there might be pathological solutions, but probably not intended.\\nGiven that in the first problem we have a numerical answer, likely the second expects f(x)=x.\\nAnd in the initial trials, f(x)=x works.\\nSo probably the only solution is f(x)=x.\\nTo confirm, suppose there is another solution.\\nBut in the standard solution, it's known that the only solution is f(x)=x.\\nUpon quick search in memory, this is a known functional equation, and the only solution is f(x)=x.\\nFor example, from f(f(y)) = y + c^2, and we showed c=0, then f(f(y))=y, and f(x^2)=f(x)^2, and then it can be shown that f(x)=x.\\nOne way: from f(x^2) = f(x)^2 ≥ 0, and for x≥0, x= (√x)^2, so f(x) = f( (√x)^2 ) = f(√x)^2 ≥ 0, so f maps [0,∞) to [0,∞)\\nThen since f is additive and f(x)≥0 for x≥0, then f is linear, f(x)=kx, but f(f(x))=x, so k^2 x = x, k=1 or -1, but f(x)≥0 for x≥0, so k=1, f(x)=x.\\nYes!\\nBecause if f is additive and f(x) ≥ 0 for all x ≥ 0, then f is linear with f(x)=f(1)x, and f(1)≥0, and f(f(x))=x implies f(1)^2 x = x, so f(1)^2=1, f(1)=1 (since ≥0), so f(x)=x.\\nPerfect.\\nSo in our case, with c=0, f(0)=0, f(f(y))=y, f(x^2)=f(x)^2\\nNow for x≥0, let t=√x≥0, then f(x) = f(t^2) = f(t)^2 ≥ 0\\nSo f(x) ≥ 0 for all x ≥ 0\\nAnd f is additive, so for x≥0, f(x)≥0\\nThen as above, f must be f(x)=x for all x.\\nSo only solution is f(x)=x.\\nThus for Problem 2, the only function is f(x)=x.\\n\\nSummary:\\nProblem 1: e = P(8) - 302398 = 302400 - 302398 = 2\\nProblem 2: f(x) = x\",\n    \"answer_1\":
