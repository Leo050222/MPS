We are to count the number of favorable outcomes where each role is selected by exactly two players.\\n\\nLet’s define:\\n- There are 5 players: P₁ through P₅.\\n- Each player selects a subset of 2 roles from the set {R₁, R₂, R₃, R₄, R₅}.\\n- Total number of possible role selections per player: C(5,2) = 10.\\n- So total number of possible outcome tuples (each player picks one pair): 10⁵.\\n\\nBut we are not being asked for probability. Instead, we are to compute e = T(favorable) − 1940, where T(favorable) is the number of assignments (over all players choosing pairs) such that each role appears in exactly two players’ choices.\\n\\nSo we need to count the number of 5-tuples of 2-element subsets of {1,2,3,4,5} (roles) such that each element (role) appears in exactly two of the subsets.\\n\\nThis is a combinatorics problem about regular hypergraphs or multiset coverings.\\n\\nWe are selecting 5 unordered pairs (since players are distinguishable, the order matters — each player's choice is labeled), so we are counting sequences (A₁, A₂, A₃, A₄, A₅), where each Aᵢ ⊆ [5], |Aᵢ| = 2, and every element of [5] appears in exactly two of the Aᵢ.\\n\\nTotal number of times roles are chosen: 5 players × 2 = 10.\\nThere are 5 roles; if each is chosen exactly twice, total = 5×2 = 10 → consistent.\\n\\nSo we want the number of 5-tuples of 2-element subsets of a 5-element set such that each element appears in exactly two subsets.\\n\\nSince the players are distinguishable, we are counting ordered 5-tuples.\\n\\nApproach:\\n\\nStep 1: Count the number of unordered collections of 5 edges (pairs) on vertex set [5], such that each vertex has degree 2. Then multiply by the number of ways to assign these edges to the 5 players, accounting for repetitions.\\n\\nBut since players are distinguishable, it's better to think: how many functions from {P₁,…,P₅} → C([5],2) such that the multiset of chosen pairs has each role in exactly two pairs.\\n\\nEquivalently: count the number of 5-edge multigraphs (without loops, since pairs are distinct elements) on 5 labeled vertices, each edge size 2, no loops, multiple edges allowed? Wait — can two players choose the same pair? Yes, since choices are independent.\\n\\nSo repetitions are allowed.\\n\\nWe are to count the number of 5-tuples (e₁,e₂,e₃,e₄,e₅), eᵢ ∈ E(K₅), such that in the multiset {e₁,…,e₅}, each vertex has degree 2.\\n\\nEach edge contributes 2 to the sum of degrees, so total degree sum = 10 → average degree 2 → yes, possible.\\n\\nWe want 5 edges (with repetition allowed) on vertex set [5], each edge size 2, such that every vertex has degree exactly 2.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to a 2-regular multigraph (pseudograph) with 5 edges on 5 vertices.\\n\\nBut a 2-regular graph (simple or multigraph) is a disjoint union of cycles. However, here we have 5 edges and 5 vertices.\\n\\nIn a simple 2-regular graph, number of edges equals number of vertices (each cycle of length k has k edges and k vertices). So a 2-regular simple graph on 5 vertices must be a 5-cycle.\\n\\nBut here, multiple edges and loops may occur? But our pairs are 2-element subsets, so no loops (since each choice is two distinct roles), but multiple edges are allowed (two players can pick the same pair).\\n\\nSo the underlying structure is a 2-regular loopless multigraph with 5 vertices and 5 edges, with each vertex degree 2.\\n\\nBut in any graph (multigraph without loops), sum of degrees = 2|E|. Here, 2×5=10, and sum of degrees is 5×2=10 → OK.\\n\\nNow, what are the possible 2-regular loopless multigraphs on 5 labeled vertices with 5 edges?\\n\\nIn a 2-regular graph (where each vertex has degree 2), the connected components are cycles. But in multigraphs, we allow multiple edges and thus 2-cycles (two edges between same pair).\\n\\nBut a 2-cycle uses 2 edges and 2 vertices.\\n\\nLet’s consider possible cycle decompositions (in multigraph sense):\\n\\nCase 1: One 5-cycle (simple cycle, no repeated edges)\\nCase 2: A 3-cycle and a 2-cycle (but 2-cycle requires two edges between two vertices)\\nCase 3: A 4-cycle and a loop? No, no loops.\\nCase 4: Two 2-cycles and a single edge? No, single edge would give degree 1 to two vertices.\\nWait, every component must be a cycle.\\n\\nSo possibilities:\\n- One 5-cycle\\n- One 3-cycle and one 2-cycle (disjoint)\\n- One 4-cycle and a self-loop? Not allowed (no loops)\\n- Five self-loops? Not allowed\\n- Three edges forming a triangle, and two edges forming a double edge elsewhere?\\n\\nWait: a 2-cycle (a pair with two edges) uses 2 vertices and 2 edges, and gives degree 2 to each of those two vertices.\\nA 3-cycle uses 3 vertices and 3 edges.\\nSo 3+2=5 vertices and 5 edges → possible.\\nSimilarly, a 5-cycle uses 5 vertices and 5 edges.\\nCan we have two 2-cycles and a single vertex? Two 2-cycles use 4 vertices and 4 edges, leaving one vertex and one edge. But one edge would connect two vertices, but only one vertex left? No. Or if it connects to existing, then degrees increase.\\nSuppose we try: two double edges (say AB, AB) and (CD, CD), that’s 4 edges, 4 vertices. One edge left, say CE. Then degrees:\\nA:2, B:2, C:3 (from CD, CD, CE), D:2, E:1 → invalid.\\nAny single edge will add degree 1 to two vertices, but we already have some with degree 2, so they’d go to 3.\\nThus impossible.\\n\\nAnother possibility: a triple edge between two vertices? That would be three copies of the same pair. Then those two vertices have degree 3 each, too much.\\n\\nOr a triangle (3-cycle) and two isolated edges? But two isolated edges would require 4 vertices, overlapping?\\nNo, triangle uses 3 vertices, two more edges need 4 vertices unless sharing.\\nBut if sharing, degrees increase.\\nFor example: triangle ABC, then edge AB again → now AB has two edges, so deg A=3, B=3, C=2 → too high.\\nEdge AD and DE → then D,E get degree 1, A gets 3 → invalid.\\n\\nSo only two types of 2-regular loopless multigraphs with 5 vertices and 5 edges:\\nType I: A single 5-cycle (simple)\\nType II: A 3-cycle and a 2-cycle (i.e., a double edge on a pair)\\n\\nNow, we need to count the number of such multigraphs, and then count how many 5-tuples of edges realize them (with order, since players are labeled).\\n\\nBut note: the multiset of edges must form such a graph, and we assign the 5 edges (with multiplicity) to the 5 players.\\n\\nSo for each such multigraph (defined by its edge multiset), the number of 5-tuples that produce it is the multinomial coefficient based on multiplicities.\\n\\nBut since players are distinguishable, for a given multiset of 5 edges (with repetition), the number of ways to assign them to players is 5! divided by the product of factorials of multiplicities.\\n\\nBut we need to generate all such multisets that yield degree 2 at each vertex.\\n\\nLet’s compute both cases.\\n\\nCase I: Simple 5-cycle.\\nHow many simple 5-cycles on 5 labeled vertices?\\nNumber of ways to arrange 5 vertices in a cycle: (5−1)! / 2 = 24 / 2 = 12 (undirected cycles).\\nBecause cycles are considered up to rotation and reflection? No — in graph theory, a cycle as a subgraph is determined by the set of edges.\\nFor a cycle A-B-C-D-E-A, the edge set is {AB,BC,CD,DE,EA}.\\nNumber of such edge sets: fix vertex A, choose two neighbors? Better: number of cyclic permutations.\\nThe number of ways to choose a cyclic ordering: there are (5−1)! = 24 directed cycles, but each undirected cycle corresponds to two directed ones, so 12 undirected 5-cycles.\\nEach 5-cycle consists of 5 distinct edges, no repetition.\\nSo the multiset has 5 distinct edges.\\nFor each such cycle, how many 5-tuples of edge choices correspond to it?\\nWe need to assign the 5 edges to the 5 players, each player gets one edge.\\nSince all edges are distinct, the number of assignments is 5! = 120.\\nBut wait: the multiset is fixed: the five edges of the cycle. The number of sequences (ordered 5-tuples) where the edges are exactly these five, one each, is 5! = 120.\\nAnd there are 12 such cycles.\\nSo total for Case I: 12 × 120 = 1440.\\n\\nCase II: A 3-cycle and a disjoint 2-cycle (double edge on a pair).\\nFirst, choose the vertices.\\nChoose 3 vertices out of 5 for the 3-cycle: C(5,3) = 10.\\nThe remaining 2 form the 2-cycle (double edge).\\nNow, for the 3 vertices, how many 3-cycles? For 3 labeled vertices, only one undirected cycle (since K₃ is a triangle). Number of cyclic orderings: (3−1)! / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1? No: for three vertices A,B,C, the cycle is unique as an undirected cycle: edges AB,BC,CA.\\nYes, only one 3-cycle on three labeled vertices.\\nFor the two vertices, say D,E, the 2-cycle means two copies of the edge DE.\\nSo the edge multiset has: three distinct edges from the triangle, and two copies of DE.\\nNow, how many sequences (ordered 5-tuples) give this multiset?\\nThe multiset has 5 edges: e1,e2,e3 (distinct, from triangle), and e4=e5=DE (same edge).\\nNumber of distinct sequences: multinomial coefficient 5! / (1!1!1!2!) = 120 / 2 = 60.\\nBut wait: the three triangle edges are all different, so we divide by 2! only for the double edge.\\nYes: 5 positions, choose 2 for the DE edge: C(5,2) = 10 ways. Then the remaining 3 edges assigned to the other 3 players: 3! = 6 ways. So total: 10 × 6 = 60.\\nSame as 5!/2! = 60.\\nNow, number of such configurations: number of ways to choose the 3 vertices: C(5,3)=10. For each, one 3-cycle, and the double edge on the remaining pair.\\nSo 10 such multisets.\\nEach gives 60 sequences.\\nSo total for Case II: 10 × 60 = 600.\\n\\nTotal favorable outcomes: Case I + Case II = 1440 + 600 = 2040.\\nBut wait: are there any overlaps or missing cases?\\nIs there another type?\\nWhat about a 4-cycle plus something? 4-cycle uses 4 vertices and 4 edges. Remaining one vertex and one edge. The edge must connect two vertices, but if it connects the isolated vertex to one in the cycle, then that vertex gets degree 3, the isolated gets degree 1. If it connects two in the cycle, those two get degree 3. If it's a loop, not allowed. So impossible.\\nThree edges on one pair? Triple edge: then two vertices have degree 3, too much.\\nA triangle with a double edge sharing a vertex? But then that vertex has degree 4 (2 from triangle, 2 from double edge if incident), or if disjoint, but triangle uses 3, double edge needs 2, total 5 vertices.\\nBut if disjoint, that’s exactly Case II.\\nIf not disjoint, say triangle ABC, and double edge AB. Then edges: AB, BC, CA, AB, AB → so AB appears three times. Then deg A: AB, AC, AB, AB → three AB and one AC → deg A=4? Wait: each edge contributes to two vertices.\\nEdge AB: contributes to A and B.\\nSo with three AB edges: A gets 3, B gets 3.\\nEdge BC: B gets +1, C gets +1 → B:4, C:1\\nEdge CA: C:2, A:4 → A:4, B:4, C:2 → not uniform.\\nSo only disjoint cases work.\\nThus only two cases.\\nTotal T(favorable) = 1440 + 600 = 2040.\\nThen e = T(favorable) - 1940 = 2040 - 1940 = 100.\\n\\nBut wait: in Case II, when we choose the 3 vertices for the triangle, and the remaining two automatically form the double edge. But is the double edge allowed? Yes, two players can choose the same pair.\\nAnd the degrees: each vertex in triangle has degree 2 (from three edges, but each vertex in a triangle has two edges incident), yes: in a triangle, each vertex has degree 2.\\nIn a double edge (two parallel edges) between two vertices, each has degree 2.\\nPerfect.\\nSo total favorable: 2040.\\nThus e = 2040 - 1940 = 100.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nDefine ||k|| as the distance from k to the nearest perfect square.\\nFor example, ||13|| = min(|13−9|, |13−16|) = min(4,3) = 3.\\nWe need the smallest positive integer n such that the average of ||1|| to ||n|| is 100:\\n(||1|| + ||2|| + ... + ||n||) / n = 100\\nSo sum_{k=1}^n ||k|| = 100n\\n\\nWe need to compute S(n) = sum_{k=1}^n ||k||, and find minimal n such that S(n) = 100n.\\n\\nNote that between consecutive squares, the behavior of ||k|| is symmetric.\\nLet m² and (m+1)² be consecutive squares.\\nThe numbers from m² to (m+1)² are from m² to m² + 2m + 1.\\nLength: 2m+2 numbers? From m² to (m+1)² inclusive is (m+1)² − m² + 1 = 2m+2 numbers.\\nBut usually we consider intervals between squares.\\nSet a_m = m².\\nThe nearest square to k depends on whether k is closer to m² or (m+1)².\\nThe midpoint between m² and (m+1)² is m² + m + 0.5.\\nSo for k from m² to m² + m, the nearest square is m², so ||k|| = k − m².\\nFor k from m² + m + 1 to (m+1)², the nearest square is (m+1)², so ||k|| = (m+1)² − k.\\nAt k = m² + m + 0.5, equidistant, but since k integer, k = m² + m and k = m² + m + 1:\\ndist to m²: (m² + m) − m² = m\\ndist to (m+1)²: (m+1)² − (m² + m) = m² + 2m + 1 − m² − m = m + 1 > m, so nearer to m².\\nSimilarly, k = m² + m + 1: dist to m²: m+1, dist to (m+1)²: (m+1)² − (m² + m + 1) = m² + 2m + 1 − m² − m − 1 = m < m+1, so nearer to (m+1)².\\nSo indeed:\\n- For k = m², m²+1, ..., m² + m: ||k|| = k − m²\\n- For k = m² + m + 1, m² + m + 2, ..., (m+1)²: ||k|| = (m+1)² − k\\n\\nNote that (m+1)² = m² + 2m + 1, so the second interval is from m² + m + 1 to m² + 2m + 1, which has length m+1.\\nFirst interval: from m² to m² + m: length m+1 values (inclusive).\\nm², m²+1, ..., m²+m: that's m+1 numbers.\\nSecond interval: m²+m+1 to m²+2m+1: that's (m²+2m+1) − (m²+m+1) + 1 = m+1 numbers.\\nSo each block between m² and (m+1)² has 2m+2 numbers, split into two halves of m+1 numbers each.\\n\\nNow, sum over k from m² to (m+1)² of ||k||:\\nFirst part: sum_{j=0}^m ||m² + j|| = sum_{j=0}^m j = 0+1+...+m = m(m+1)/2\\nSecond part: sum_{j=m+1}^{2m+1} ||m² + j||, but j from m+1 to 2m+1, let i = j − m, then k = m² + m + i, i=1 to m+1\\n||k|| = (m+1)² − k = (m² + 2m + 1) − (m² + m + i) = m + 1 − i\\nSo sum_{i=1}^{m+1} (m+1 − i) = sum_{d=0}^{m} d = 0+1+...+m = m(m+1)/2\\nWhere d = m+1−i, i=1 to m+1 ⇒ d=m down to 0.\\nSo sum = m(m+1)/2\\nThus total sum over the block from m² to (m+1)² inclusive: m(m+1)/2 + m(m+1)/2 = m(m+1)\\n\\nThe block includes k = m² to k = (m+1)², inclusive.\\nNumber of terms: (m+1)² − m² + 1 = 2m+2\\nSum: m(m+1)\\n\\nBut note: k = (m+1)² is included here, and it will also be the start of the next block? No, because next block starts at (m+1)².\\nSo if we sum from m=1 to M, we go from 1²=1 to (M+1)², but with overlap at the squares.\\nBetter to handle the blocks carefully.\\n\\nActually, the blocks [m², (m+1)²] for m=1,2,3,... cover from 1 to ∞, but they overlap at the endpoints.\\nSpecifically, k = (m+1)² is included in both block m and block m+1.\\nTo avoid double-counting, we should define half-open intervals or adjust.\\n\\nNote that for m ≥ 1, the interval from m² to (m+1)² − 1 might be better, but then we miss the squares.\\nAlternatively, note that at k = m², ||k|| = 0, and it's included.\\nBut in the sum above, for block m, we include k=m² to k=(m+1)².\\nBut k=(m+1)² is also the start of block m+1.\\nSo if we sum over m starting from 1, we double-count k=4,9,16,... etc.\\n\\nBetter: define the sum from k=1 to k=N, and group by the intervals between squares.\\nLet’s consider the sum S(n) = sum_{k=1}^n ||k||\\nWe can write n in terms of the largest square ≤ n.\\nBut perhaps compute cumulative sum up to (m+1)².\\nLet T(m) = sum_{k=1}^{m^2} ||k||\\nBut k=1 is 1², so for m=1, T(1) = ||1|| = 0\\nFor m=2, sum_{k=1}^4 ||k|| = ||1|| + ||2|| + ||3|| + ||4|| = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2\\nFrom earlier, for each block from j² to (j+1)², the sum is j(j+1), but this includes k=j² to k=(j+1)².\\nBut if we sum over j from 1 to m−1, we get sum from k=1² to k=m², but with k=4,9,..., (m−1)² counted twice? Let's see:\\nBlock j=1: k=1 to 4\\nBlock j=2: k=4 to 9\\nSo k=4 is in both.\\nSimilarly, k=9 in j=2 and j=3, etc.\\nSo if we sum_{j=1}^{m−1} [sum over block j] = sum_{j=1}^{m−1} j(j+1), this counts interior squares twice and endpoints once? Actually, k=1 is only in j=1, k=m² is only in j=m−1? For j=m−1, block is from (m−1)² to m².\\nSo k=1: only j=1\\nk=4: j=1 and j=2\\nk=9: j=2 and j=3\\n...\\nk=(m−1)²: j=m−2 and j=m−1\\nk=m²: only j=m−1\\nSo the sum sum_{j=1}^{m−1} j(j+1) counts:\\n- k=1: once\\n- k=m²: once\\n- k=j² for j=2 to m−1: twice\\n- all other k: once\\nBut we want each k counted once.\\nSo T(m) = sum_{k=1}^{m^2} ||k|| = [sum_{j=1}^{m−1} j(j+1)] − sum_{j=2}^{m−1} ||j²||\\nBut ||j²|| = 0 for all j, so subtracting 0.\\nBut the double-counted k's are the squares from 4 to (m−1)², but since their ||k||=0, even if counted twice, it doesn't affect the sum.\\nTherefore, sum_{k=1}^{m^2} ||k|| = sum_{j=1}^{m−1} j(j+1)\\nBecause the extra counts are at squares, which contribute 0.\\nNow, j(j+1) = j² + j\\nSo sum_{j=1}^{m−1} (j² + j) = sum j² + sum j = (m−1)m(2m−1)/6 + (m−1)m/2 = (m−1)m [ (2m−1)/6 + 1/2 ] = (m−1)m [ (2m−1 + 3)/6 ] = (m−1)m (2m+2)/6 = (m−1)m * 2(m+1)/6 = (m−1)m(m+1)/3\\nSo T(m) = (m−1)m(m+1)/3 = m(m²−1)/3\\nNow, check for m=2: T(2) = sum_{k=1}^4 ||k|| = 0+1+1+0=2\\nFormula: 2*(4−1)/3 = 2*3/3=2 → good.\\nm=3: sum_{k=1}^9 ||k||\\nCompute: k=1:0,2:1,3:1,4:0,5:1,6:2,7:1,8:1,9:0? Wait\\nk=5: dist to 4=1, to 9=4 → min=1\\nk=6: to 4=2, to 9=3 → min=2\\nk=7: to 9=2, to 4=3 → min=2? Wait no, 7−4=3, 9−7=2 → min=2\\nEarlier I said 1, mistake.\\n||7||=2\\nk=8: 8−4=4, 9−8=1 → min=1\\nk=9:0\\nSo sum: k1:0, k2:1, k3:1, k4:0, k5:1, k6:2, k7:2, k8:1, k9:0 → sum=0+1+1+0+1+2+2+1+0=8\\nFormula: m=3, T(3)=3*(9−1)/3=3*8/3=8 → good.\\n\\nNow, we need sum up to n, not necessarily a square.\\nLet n be arbitrary. Let m be such that m² ≤ n < (m+1)²\\nThen S(n) = sum_{k=1}^{m^2} ||k|| + sum_{k=m^2 + 1}^n ||k||\\nFirst term: T(m) = m(m²−1)/3\\nSecond term: k from m²+1 to n\\nNow, depending on where n is.\\nRecall that for k from m² to m² + m, ||k|| = k − m²\\nFor k from m² + m + 1 to (m+1)², ||k|| = (m+1)² − k\\nNow, m² + m = m(m+1)\\n(m+1)² = m² + 2m + 1\\nThe point m² + m is the last where nearest square is m².\\nm² + m + 1 is first where nearest is (m+1)².\\nNow, n < (m+1)² = m² + 2m + 1\\nSo two subcases:\\nSubcase 1: m² < n ≤ m² + m\\nThen for k from m²+1 to n, ||k|| = k − m²\\nSo sum_{k=m^2+1}^n (k − m²) = sum_{j=1}^{n - m^2} j = (n - m²)(n - m² + 1)/2\\nSubcase 2: m² + m < n < (m+1)²\\nThen sum from k=m²+1 to m² + m: ||k|| = k − m²\\nPlus sum from k=m² + m + 1 to n: ||k|| = (m+1)² − k\\nFirst sum: k=m²+1 to m²+m: j=1 to m, sum j = m(m+1)/2\\nSecond sum: k=m² + m + 1 to n\\nLet i = k − (m² + m), so i=1 to n − (m² + m)\\n||k|| = (m+1)² − k = (m² + 2m + 1) − (m² + m + i) = m + 1 − i\\nSo sum_{i=1}^{r} (m+1 − i) where r = n − (m² + m)\\n= sum_{d=m+1−r}^{m} d ? Better: sum_{i=1}^r (m+1 − i) = sum_{j=m+1−r}^{m} j , where j=m+1−i\\nWhen i=1, j=m; i=r, j=m+1−r\\nSo sum from j=m+1−r to j=m of j = [sum_{j=1}^m j] − [sum_{j=1}^{m−r} j] = m(m+1)/2 − (m−r)(m−r+1)/2\\nSince r = n − m² − m, and n < m² + 2m + 1, r < m+1, so m−r > −1, but since r ≥1, m−r ≤ m−1\\nBut we need m−r ≥0? Not necessarily, if r > m, but r = n − m² − m ≤ (m² + 2m) − m² − m = m, since n ≤ m² + 2m (as n < m² + 2m +1 and integer), so r ≤ m\\nThus m−r ≥0\\nSo sum = m(m+1)/2 − (m−r)(m−r+1)/2\\nWith r = n − m² − m\\nNow, back to S(n) = T(m) + additional sum\\nT(m) = m(m²−1)/3\\nWe want S(n) = 100n\\nWe suspect n is large, so m is large.\\nAssume n is just below (m+1)², and large.\\nNote that for large m, the average near m² is roughly proportional to m.\\nSpecifically, in the block from m² to (m+1)², there are 2m+2 numbers, sum of ||k|| is m(m+1), so average is m(m+1)/(2m+2) = m(m+1)/(2(m+1)) = m/2\\nSo average grows like m/2\\nWe want average 100, so m ≈ 200\\nTry m around 200.\\nBut S(n) = 100n, so n ≈ 2 * average index, but average ||k|| ≈ m/2 when n≈m², so m/2 ≈ 100 ⇒ m≈200\\nSo try m=200\\nThen T(200) = 200*(40000 − 1)/3 = 200*39999/3 = 200*13333 = 2,666,600\\nNow, n > 200² = 40,000\\nWe need S(n) = 100n\\nCurrently at n=40,000, S(n)=2,666,600\\n100n = 4,000,000\\nBut 2,666,600 < 4,000,000, so we need larger n.\\nAs n increases beyond 40,000, S(n) increases, but slowly at first.\\nFor k from 40,001 to 40,200 (since m=200, m² + m = 40,000 + 200 = 40,200), ||k|| = k − 40,000\\nSo linearly increasing from 1 to 200.\\nThen from 40,201 to 40,401 (since (201)^2 = 40401), ||k|| = 40401 − k, decreasing from 200 to 1.\\nNow, at n=40,401, which is 201², S(n) = T(201) = 201*(201² − 1)/3 = 201*(40401 − 1)/3 = 201*40400/3\\nCompute: 40400 / 3 = 13466.666? 40400 ÷ 3 = 13466.666? 3*13466=40398, remainder 2, not divisible?\\nBut earlier formula T(m) = m(m²−1)/3\\nm²−1 = (m−1)(m+1), so for m=201, (201−1)(201+1)=200*202=40400, yes.\\nSo T(201) = 201 * 40400 / 3\\n201 / 3 = 67, so 67 * 40400 = ?\\n67 * 40000 = 2,680,000\\n67 * 400 = 26,800\\nTotal 2,680,000 + 26,800 = 2,706,800\\n40400 * 67:\\n40000*67=2,680,000\\n400*67=26,800\\nSum 2,706,800\\nNow, 100n at n=40401 is 100*40401=4,040,100\\nBut S(n)=2,706,800 < 4,040,100, still less.\\nBut earlier at m=200, S(40000)=2,666,600, 100n=4,000,000\\nAt m=201, S(40401)=2,706,800, 100n=4,040,100\\nStill S(n) << 100n\\nI think I confused.\\nS(n) is sum of ||k||, which is around m² * (average ||k||) ~ m² * (m/2) / something, no.\\nAt n=m², S(n) = T(m) = m(m²−1)/3 ≈ m³/3\\n100n = 100 m²\\nSo we need m³/3 ≈ 100 m² ⇒ m/3 ≈ 100 ⇒ m≈300\\nAh, I see, I mistakenly thought average ||k|| ≈ m/2, but that's the average over the m-th block, but cumulative average is different.\\nAt n=m², S(n) ≈ m³/3, n=m², so average = S(n)/n ≈ (m³/3)/m² = m/3\\nSet m/3 ≈ 100 ⇒ m≈300\\nSo try m=300\\nT(300) = 300*(90000 − 1)/3 = 300*89999/3 = 100*89999 = 8,999,900\\n100n = 100*90000 = 9,000,000\\nSo S(90000) = 8,999,900\\n100n = 9,000,000\\nSo S(n) = 8,999,900 < 9,000,000 = 100n\\nDifference: 100n − S(n) = 9,000,000 − 8,999,900 = 100\\nNow, we need to go beyond n=90000\\nNow, for k>90000, m=300, since 300²=90000, 301²=90601\\nFor k from 90001 to 90000 + 300 = 90300, ||k|| = k − 90000\\nSo at k=90001, ||k||=1; k=90002, ||k||=2; ... up to k=90300, ||k||=300\\nThen from k=90301 to 90601, ||k|| = 90601 − k, from 200 down to 0? At k=90301, ||k||=90601−90301=300; k=90601, ||k||=0\\nNow, currently at n=90000, S(n)=8,999,900\\nWe need S(n) = 100n\\nLet n = 90000 + d, d≥1\\nThen S(n) = S(90000) + sum_{k=90001}^n ||k||\\nFor n ≤ 90300, ||k|| = k − 90000 for k=90001 to n\\nSo sum_{k=90001}^n (k − 90000) = sum_{j=1}^d j = d(d+1)/2\\nSo S(n) = 8,999,900 + d(d+1)/2\\n100n = 100(90000 + d) = 9,000,000 + 100d\\nSet equal:\\n8,999,900 + d(d+1)/2 = 9,000,000 + 100d\\nBring all to left:\\nd(d+1)/2 − 100d − 100 = 0\\nMultiply by 2:\\nd² + d − 200d − 200 = 0\\nd² − 199d − 200 = 0\\nSolve quadratic: d = [199 ± √(199² + 800)] / 2\\n199² = 39601\\n39601 + 800 = 40401\\n√40401 = ? 201²=40401, yes!\\nSo d = [199 + 201]/2 = 400/2 = 200\\nOr d = [199 − 201]/2 = −2/2 = −1, not useful\\nSo d=200\\nNow, check if n=90000+200=90200 ≤ 90300? Yes, 90200 < 90300, so in the range.\\nNow, verify:\\nS(n) = 8,999,900 + sum_{j=1}^{200} j = 8,999,900 + 200*201/2 = 8,999,900 + 20100 = 9,020,000\\n100n = 100 * 90200 = 9,020,000\\nEqual!\\nNow, is this the smallest? We need to confirm that for smaller n, S(n) < 100n\\nAt n=90000, S(n)=8,999,900, 100n=9,000,000, so S(n) < 100n\\nFor n<90200, say n=90199\\nd=199\\nS(n)=8,999,900 + sum_{j=1}^{199} j = 8,999,900 + 199*200/2 = 8,999,900 + 19,900 = 9,019,800\\n100n=100*90199=9,019,900\\n9,019,800 < 9,019,900, so S(n) < 100n\\nAt n=90200, equal.\\nSo yes, smallest n is 90200.\\nBut is there any smaller n in previous blocks? For example, if at some earlier m, but since the average is increasing, and at m=300, we reach it, and before that at n=90000, average is 8,999,900 / 90,000 ≈ 99.998..., less than 100, and it increases, so no smaller n.\\nTo be thorough, suppose at the end of previous block, n=299²=89401\\nT(299)=299*(299²−1)/3=299*(89401−1)/3=299*89400/3\\n89400/3=29800, so 299*29800\\n300*29800=8,940,000 minus 29800=8,910,200? 299=300−1, so 300*29800 − 1*29800=8,940,000 − 29,800=8,910,200\\n100n=100*89401=8,940,100\\n8,910,200 < 8,940,100, so less.\\nAnd as n increases to 90000, S(n) increases to 8,999,900, 100n to 9,000,000, still less until n=90200.\\nSo yes.\\nThus n=90200.\\n\\nBack to Problem 1: we had T(favorable)=2040, e=2040−1940=100\\nAnswer 1: 100\\nAnswer 2: 90200\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"90200\"\n}",
