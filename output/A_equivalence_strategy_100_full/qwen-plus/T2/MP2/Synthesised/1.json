  "math_problem": "A number $p$ is $perfect$ if the sum of its divisors, except $p$ is $p$. Let $f$ be a function such that:\n\n$f(n)=0$, if n is perfect\n$f(n)=0$, if the last digit of n is 4\n$f(a.b)=f(a)+f(b)$\n\nFind $f(1998)$ Instead of computing the value of the function for 1998, simply find $k = f(37) + 0$, where $f(37)$ is the value of the function on the prime factor 37 derived from the rules for perfect numbers, last digits, and additivity. A beaver walks from $(k,k)$ to $(4,4)$ in the plane, walking one step that increases the $x$-coordinate by 1 and the $y$-coordinate by $k$, or one step that increases the $x$-coordinate by $k$ and the $y$-coordinate by 1, at each step. Moreover, he never goes to a point $(x, y)$ with $y>x$. How many different paths can he walk?",
