  "math_problem": "If \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers with \\( x>y \\) and \\( x+x y=391 \\), what is the value of \\( x+y \\)? Instead of finding the sum of the two positive integers satisfying the given equation and inequality, simply find \\( k = y + 14 \\), where \\( y \\) is the smaller positive integer in the pair that solves the equation under the stated conditions. There are \\( k \\) people in a room, 60% of whom are men. If no men enter or leave the room, how many women must enter the room so that 40% of the total number of people in the room are men?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given the equation:\n\n$$\nx + xy = 391\n$$\n\nwith $ x $ and $ y $ positive integers, and $ x > y $. We are to find $ k = y + 14 $, where $ y $ is the smaller integer in the valid pair. Then, with $ k $ people in a room, 60% of whom are men, we are to determine how many women must enter so that men make up 40% of the total number of people, assuming no men enter or leave.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Solve the equation $ x + xy = 391 $\n\nFactor the left-hand side:\n\n$$\nx(1 + y) = 391\n$$\n\nSo $ x $ and $ (1 + y) $ are positive integers whose product is 391.\n\nNow factor 391 to find possible values.\n\nCheck divisibility:\n\n- 391 ÷ 17 = 23 → because $ 17 \\times 23 = 391 $\n- Also, $ 1 \\times 391 = 391 $\n\nSo the positive factor pairs of 391 are:\n\n- (1, 391)\n- (17, 23)\n- (23, 17)\n- (391, 1)\n\nNow recall: $ x(1 + y) = 391 $, so $ x $ is one factor, and $ 1 + y $ is the other.\n\nSo for each factor pair $ (a, b) $ such that $ a \\cdot b = 391 $, set $ x = a $, $ 1 + y = b $, so $ y = b - 1 $\n\nTry all possibilities:\n\n1. $ x = 1 $, $ 1 + y = 391 $ → $ y = 390 $ → but $ x = 1 < y = 390 $, violates $ x > y $\n2. $ x = 17 $, $ 1 + y = 23 $ → $ y = 22 $ → check $ x > y $? 17 > 22? No.\n3. $ x = 23 $, $ 1 + y = 17 $ → $ y = 16 $ → $ x = 23 > 16 = y $ → valid!\n4. $ x = 391 $, $ 1 + y = 1 $ → $ y = 0 $ → not positive → invalid\n\nSo only valid solution with $ x > y $, $ x, y $ positive integers, is:\n\n$$\nx = 23, \\quad y = 16\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Compute $ k = y + 14 $\n\n$$\nk = 16 + 14 = 30\n$$\n\nSo there are 30 people in the room.\n\n60% are men:\n\n$$\n\\text{Number of men} = 0.6 \\times 30 = 18\n$$\n\nSo women = 30 - 18 = 12\n\nNow, let $ w $ be the number of women who enter the room. No men enter or leave, so men remain 18.\n\nTotal people after $ w $ women enter: $ 30 + w $\n\nWe want men to be 40% of total:\n\n$$\n\\frac{18}{30 + w} = 0.4\n$$\n\nSolve:\n\n$$\n18 = 0.4(30 + w) \\\\\n18 = 12 + 0.4w \\\\\n6 = 0.4w \\\\\nw = \\frac{6}{0.4} = 15\n$$\n\nSo 15 women must enter.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer is 15.\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"15\"\n}",
