  "math_problem": "Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. Friday, at which point it had been on for exactly 100 hours. At what time had Kamile turned her computer on? Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day. Three different numbers from the list $2, 3, 4, 6$ have a sum of $k$. What is the product of these numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are told that Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. on Friday, and at that point it had been on for exactly 100 hours. We are not asked to find the exact time she turned it on, but instead to compute a value $ k = h + 7 $, where $ h $ is the remainder when 100 is divided by the number of hours in a day.\n\nStep 1: Determine $ h $\n\nThere are 24 hours in a day. So divide 100 by 24:\n\n$$\n100 \\div 24 = 4 \\text{ remainder } 4\n$$\n\nBecause:\n$$\n24 \\times 4 = 96,\\quad 100 - 96 = 4\n$$\n\nSo $ h = 4 $\n\nStep 2: Compute $ k = h + 7 $\n\n$$\nk = 4 + 7 = 11\n$$\n\nSo $ k = 11 $\n\nStep 3: From the list $ 2, 3, 4, 6 $, choose three different numbers that sum to $ k = 11 $. Find their product.\n\nList all combinations of three different numbers from $ \\{2, 3, 4, 6\\} $:\n\n- $ 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 $ → too small\n- $ 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 $ → this works\n- $ 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 $ → too big\n- $ 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 $ → too big\n\nOnly one combination sums to 11: $ 2, 3, 6 $\n\nNow compute their product:\n\n$$\n2 \\times 3 \\times 6 = 6 \\times 6 = 36\n$$\n\nFinal answer is 36.\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"36\"\n}",
