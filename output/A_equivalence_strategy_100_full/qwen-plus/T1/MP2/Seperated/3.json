The problem asks for the race distance s equal to the solution (d) plus 48, so s = 52 + 48 = 100.\\n\\nProblem 2: Megan's time to complete 100 m is distance/speed = 100 / (5/4) = 80 seconds. Hana finishes 5 seconds earlier, so her time is 80 - 5 = 75 seconds. Hana's average speed is 100 / 75 = 4/3 m/s.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4/3\"\n}",
