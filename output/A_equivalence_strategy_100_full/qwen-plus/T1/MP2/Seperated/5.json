      "A3077": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The ratio of skateboards to bicycles is 7:4, so let skateboards = 7k and bicycles = 4k. The difference is 7k - 4k = 3k = 12, so k = 4. Then d = k + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10.\\n\\nProblem 2: To have equal remaining candies, the maximum possible remaining count x is limited by the smallest initial count (blue = 3). Setting x = 3: red eaten = 10 - 3 = 7, yellow eaten = 7 - 3 = 4, blue eaten = 3 - 3 = 0. Total eaten = 7 + 4 + 0 = 11. Lower x values result in higher total eaten, so 11 is minimal.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
