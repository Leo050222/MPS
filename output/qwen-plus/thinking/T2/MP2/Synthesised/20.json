Instead of finding all positive integers making the given rational expression a positive integer, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the positive integer such that for each such positive integer, it equals the value of the expression plus $k$. Find all the values of $m$ for which the zeros of $2 x^{2}-m x-8$ differ by $|m - k|$.",
