  "math_problem": "Let $N$ be a positive integer. Brothers Michael and Kylo each select a positive integer less than or equal to $N$, independently and uniformly at random. Let $p_{N}$ denote the probability that the product of these two integers has a units digit of 0. The maximum possible value of $p_{N}$ over all possible choices of $N$ can be written as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing one hundred times the numerator plus the denominator when the maximum possible value of $p_N$ is expressed as a reduced fraction, simply find $k$, the maximum possible value of $p_N$ derived from the upper bound analysis of the probability. For how many ordered triplets $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers less than 10 is the product $a \\times b \\times c$ divisible by $\\left(k + \\frac{1973}{100}\\right)$?",
