  "math_problem": "Two diameters and one radius are drawn in a circle of radius 1, dividing the circle into 5 sectors. The largest possible area of the smallest sector can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b} \\pi$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100a+b$. Instead of computing the numerical identifier formed by the numerator and denominator of the reduced fractional coefficient of $\\pi$ expressing the largest possible area of the smallest sector, simply find $k$, where $k$ is four greater than the denominator of that fraction. What is the smallest integer greater than $k$ such that the sum of the digits in its base $k$ representation is equal to the sum of the digits in its base 17 representation?",
