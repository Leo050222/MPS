  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be the answer to this problem. Box $B$ initially contains $n$ balls, and Box $A$ contains half as many balls as Box $B$. After 80 balls are moved from Box $A$ to Box $B$, the ratio of balls in Box $A$ to Box $B$ is now $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1$. Find $100p+q$. Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio. Let $T$ be a trapezoid with two right angles and side lengths $4,4,5$, and $\\sqrt{17}$. Two line segments are drawn, connecting the midpoints of opposite sides of $T$ and dividing $T$ into $k$ regions. If the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest of these regions is $d$, compute $240 d$.",
