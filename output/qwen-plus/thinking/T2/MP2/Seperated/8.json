On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^{2}$."

The ID number satisfies the following property: the first two digits is a number divisible by 2, the first three digits is a number divisible by 3, etc. so that the ID number itself is divisible by 6. One ID number that satisfies this condition is 123252. How many different possibilities are there for Bob's ID number?"
