  "math_problem": "Consider the following flowchart: INPUT $\\rightarrow$ Subtract $8 \\rightarrow \\square \\rightarrow$ Divide by $2 \\rightarrow \\square$ Add $16 \\rightarrow$ OUTPUT. If the OUTPUT is 32, what was the INPUT? Instead of determining the initial input value that produces the specified output via the flowchart's sequence of operations, simply find $k = A - 26$, where $A$ is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step. What is the $y$-intercept of the line $y = x + 4$ after it is translated down $k$ units?",
