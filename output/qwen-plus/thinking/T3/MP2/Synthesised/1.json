  "math_problem": "The game of Penta is played with teams of five players each, and there are five roles the players can play. Each of the five players chooses two of five roles they wish to play. If each player chooses their roles randomly, what is the probability that each role will have exactly two players? Instead of computing the probability that every role is selected by precisely two players, simply find T(favorable), the total number of favorable outcomes where each role receives exactly two choices. Given a positive integer $k$, let $\\|k\\|$ denote the absolute difference between $k$ and the nearest perfect square. For example, $\\|13\\|=3$ since the nearest perfect square to 13 is 16. Compute the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{\\|1\\|+\\|2\\|+\\cdots+\\|n\\|}{n}=(T(favorable)-1940)$.",
