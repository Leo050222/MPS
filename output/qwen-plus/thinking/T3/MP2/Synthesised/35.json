  "math_problem": "Let $x, y, z$ be real numbers satisfying $$\\frac{1}{x}+y+z=x+\\frac{1}{y}+z=x+y+\\frac{1}{z}=3$$ The sum of all possible values of $x+y+z$ can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing the sum of all possible totals and the associated $100m + n$, simply find $k = z - 2$, where $z$ is the common value taken by the two equal variables in the solution where exactly two of the variables are equal. Regular polygons $I C A O, V E N T I$, and $A L B E D O$ lie on a plane. Given that $I N= k$, compute the number of possible values of $O N$.",
