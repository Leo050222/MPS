FemtoPravis is walking on an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard that wraps around at its edges (so squares on the left edge of the chessboard are adjacent to squares on the right edge, and similarly for the top and bottom edges). Each femtosecond, FemtoPravis moves in one of the four diagonal directions uniformly at random. After $n$ femtoseconds, what is the probability that FemtoPravis is at his original location?",
