Find all integers $n\\\\geq 2$ for which \\\\[P(n)+\\\\lfloor\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\rfloor=P(n+1)+\\\\lfloor\\\\sqrt{n+1}\\\\rfloor\\\\] Instead of finding all integers $n\\\\geq 2$ for which $P(n)+\\\\lfloor\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\rfloor=P(n+1)+\\\\lfloor\\\\sqrt{n+1}\\\\rfloor$, simply find $k = p + 11$, where $p$ is the greatest prime divisor of the integer $n$ that satisfies the condition. Determine all quadruples $(x,y,z,t)$ of positive integers such that\n\\\\[ 20^x + k^{2y} = (x + 2y + z)^{zt}.\\\\]",
