Instead of determining all composite positive integers $n$ for which such a circular arrangement exists, simply find $k = \\gcd(p, q) + 1$, where $p$ and $q$ are the distinct prime factors of $n$ in the case where the set of divisors of $n$ greater than 1 has exactly three elements. Let $\\mathbb{N}$ denote the set of positive integers. Find all functions $f : \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that for positive integers $a$ and $b,$ \n\\[f(a^k + b^k) = f(a)f(b) \\text{ and } f(a^k) = f(a)^2.\\]",
