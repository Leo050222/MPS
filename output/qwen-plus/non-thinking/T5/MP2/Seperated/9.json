Then $f(c) = 0$.\\n\\nStep 2: Try $y = 0$.\\n\\n$$\\nf(0 + f(x^2)) = x f(x) \\\\Rightarrow f(f(x^2)) = x f(x) \\\\quad (1)\\n$$\\n\\nStep 3: Use symmetry or injectivity?\\n\\nTry to see if $f$ is linear. Suppose $f(x) = kx$. Test in original equation:\\n\\nLeft-hand side: $f(xy + f(x^2)) = f(xy + kx^2) = k(xy + kx^2) = kxy + k^2 x^2$\\n\\nRight-hand side: $x f(x+y) = x \\\\cdot k(x+y) = kx(x+y) = kx^2 + kxy$\\n\\nSet equal: $kxy + k^2 x^2 = kx^2 + kxy \\\\Rightarrow k^2 x^2 = kx^2$\\n\\nSo $k^2 = k \\\\Rightarrow k = 0$ or $k = 1$\\n\\nTry $f(x) = 0$: \\n\\nLHS: $f(xy + f(x^2)) = f(xy + 0) = 0$\\n\\nRHS: $x f(x+y) = x \\\\cdot 0 = 0$ → works.\\n\\nTry $f(x) = x$: \\n\\nLHS: $f(xy + f(x^2)) = f(xy + x^2) = xy + x^2$\\n\\nRHS: $x f(x+y) = x(x+y) = x^2 + xy$ → same → works.\\n\\nSo both $f(x) = 0$ and $f(x) = x$ are solutions.\\n\\nAre there more?\\n\\nWe now try to prove these are the only ones.\\n\\nSuppose $f$ is not identically zero.\\n\\nFrom earlier: $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$\\n\\nTry $x = 1$:\\n\\n$$\\nf(f(1)) = 1 \\\\cdot f(1) = f(1)\\n$$\\nSo $f(f(1)) = f(1)$ → so $f(a) = a$ where $a = f(1)$\\n\\nNow go back to original equation. Try $x = 1$:\\n\\n$$\\nf(y + f(1)) = 1 \\\\cdot f(1 + y) \\\\Rightarrow f(y + a) = f(1 + y)\\n$$\\nSo $f(y + a) = f(y + 1)$ for all $y$ → $f(z + (a - 1)) = f(z)$ for all $z$ → periodic with period $|a - 1|$ if $a \\\\ne 1$\\n\\nBut if $f$ is periodic and satisfies this functional equation, likely only constant or identity work.\\n\\nBut suppose $a = f(1) \\\\ne 1$, then $f$ is periodic.\\n\\nBut from $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$, the right-hand side grows like $x f(x)$, which unless $f$ grows, may contradict periodicity.\\n\\nSuppose $f$ is periodic with period $T \\\\ne 0$. Then $f(x + T) = f(x)$ for all $x$.\\n\\nBut $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$. Left-hand side is bounded if $f$ is bounded (since $f(x^2)$ takes values in range of $f$, and $f$ applied to that is bounded). But right-hand side is $x f(x)$. If $f$ is bounded, say $|f(x)| \\\\le M$, then $|x f(x)| \\\\le M|x|$, but actually left side is bounded, so $|x f(x)|$ is bounded → implies $f(x) = o(1/x)$ as $|x|\\\\to\\\\infty$, but since bounded, only possible if $f(x) \\\\to 0$, but more strongly: $|x f(x)| \\\\le C$ for some $C$, so $|f(x)| \\\\le C/|x|$ for large $x$ → $f(x) \\\\to 0$ as $|x|\\\\to\\\\infty$.\\n\\nBut if $f$ is periodic and tends to 0 at infinity, then $f \\\\equiv 0$.\\n\\nBecause periodic and continuous? Wait, no continuity assumed.\\n\\nBut even without continuity: if $f$ is periodic with period $T$, then its values repeat, so if it tends to 0 at infinity, then for any $x$, $f(x + nT) = f(x)$, but $f(x + nT) \\\\to 0$ as $n \\\\to \\\\infty$, so $f(x) = 0$.\\n\\nThus, if $f$ is periodic and $\\\\lim_{|x|\\\\to\\\\infty} f(x) = 0$, then $f \\\\equiv 0$.\\n\\nBut from $|x f(x)|$ bounded and $f$ periodic → $f(x) \\\\to 0$ as $|x|\\\\to\\\\infty$ only if $f \\\\equiv 0$, because otherwise it oscillates.\\n\\nMore carefully: if $f$ is periodic and not identically zero, then there exists $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) \\\\ne 0$, and $f(x_0 + nT) = f(x_0) \\\\ne 0$, so does not tend to 0. But $|x f(x)|$ must be bounded → $|f(x)| \\\\le C/|x|$. For $x = x_0 + nT$, $|f(x)| = |f(x_0)| > 0$, but $C/|x| \\\\to 0$, so for large $n$, contradiction.\\n\\nTherefore, if $f$ is periodic and $|x f(x)|$ bounded, then $f \\\\equiv 0$.\\n\\nThus, in our case, if $a = f(1) \\\\ne 1$, then $f$ is periodic with period $a - 1 \\\\ne 0$, and from $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$, LHS is bounded (as composition of $f$), so RHS $x f(x)$ is bounded, so above argument applies → $f \\\\equiv 0$.\\n\\nBut if $f \\\\equiv 0$, then $f(1) = 0 \\\\ne 1$, so $a = 0$, period $-1$, but still periodic, and indeed $f \\\\equiv 0$ is a solution.\\n\\nOtherwise, if $f$ is not identically zero, then we cannot have $a \\\\ne 1$, so must have $a = 1$, i.e., $f(1) = 1$.\\n\\nSo assume $f(1) = 1$.\\n\\nNow recall from earlier: $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$\\n\\nTry to show $f$ is injective?\\n\\nSuppose $f(a) = f(b)$. Can we get $a = b$?\\n\\nNot obvious.\\n\\nTry $y = -x$ in original equation:\\n\\n$$\\nf(-x^2 + f(x^2)) = x f(0) = x c\\n$$\\nwhere $c = f(0)$\\n\\nSo $f(f(x^2) - x^2) = c x$\\n\\nInteresting.\\n\\nLet $g(x) = f(x^2) - x^2$, then $f(g(x)) = c x$\\n\\nIf $c \\\\ne 0$, then $f(g(x)) = c x$, so $f$ is surjective (since RHS covers all reals), and also $g(x) = f^{-1}(c x)$ if injective.\\n\\nBut let's see.\\n\\nWe also have from earlier: $f(f(0)) = 0$, and $f(0) = c$, so $f(c) = 0$\\n\\nNow, suppose $c = f(0) = 0$\\n\\nThen $f(c) = f(0) = 0$, consistent.\\n\\nAnd from above: $f(f(x^2) - x^2) = c x = 0$\\n\\nSo $f(f(x^2) - x^2) = 0$ for all $x$\\n\\nNow, if we can show $f(a) = 0$ implies $a = 0$, then $f(x^2) - x^2 = 0$, so $f(x^2) = x^2$, so $f(t) = t$ for $t \\\\ge 0$\\n\\nThen extend to negative?\\n\\nBut we don't know yet.\\n\\nFirst, suppose $f(0) = c = 0$\\n\\nThen $f(f(x^2) - x^2) = 0$\\n\\nNow, can we show that $f(z) = 0$ implies $z = 0$?\\n\\nSuppose $f(a) = 0$ for some $a$\\n\\nGo back to original equation:\\n\\n$f(xy + f(x^2)) = x f(x + y)$\\n\\nSet $x + y = a$, so $y = a - x$\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$f(x(a - x) + f(x^2)) = x f(a) = x \\\\cdot 0 = 0$\\n\\nSo $f(x(a - x) + f(x^2)) = 0$ for all $x$\\n\\nSo for all $x$, the value $x(a - x) + f(x^2)$ is a root of $f$\\n\\nIf we assume that the only root is 0, then $x(a - x) + f(x^2) = 0$ for all $x$\\n\\nBut we don't know that.\\n\\nIn the case $f \\\\equiv 0$, every point is a root.\\n\\nBut now we are considering non-zero solutions.\\n\\nEarlier we have two candidates: $f(x) = 0$ and $f(x) = x$\\n\\nNow, suppose $f$ is not identically zero, and $f(0) = c$\\n\\nWe had that if $f(1) \\\\ne 1$, then $f \\\\equiv 0$, so for non-zero solution, $f(1) = 1$\\n\\nNow, what is $f(0)$?\\n\\nTry $x = 1$ in $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$: $f(f(1)) = 1 \\\\cdot f(1) = 1$, and $f(1) = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$, good.\\n\\nNow try $x = -1$\\n\\nFirst, compute $f(f(1)) = f(f((-1)^2)) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$, and right-hand side: $x f(x) = (-1) f(-1) = -f(-1)$\\n\\nSo $1 = -f(-1) \\\\Rightarrow f(-1) = -1$\\n\\nGood, consistent with $f(x) = x$\\n\\nNow, suppose $f(0) = c$\\n\\nFrom earlier: $f(f(x^2) - x^2) = c x$\\n\\nIf $c \\\\ne 0$, then as $x$ varies, $c x$ covers all reals, so $f$ is surjective.\\n\\nAlso, $f(f(x^2) - x^2) = c x$\\n\\nNow, set $x = 0$: $f(f(0) - 0) = 0 \\\\Rightarrow f(c) = 0$, which we already know.\\n\\nNow, suppose $c \\\\ne 0$, say $c = f(0) \\\\ne 0$\\n\\nThen $f(c) = 0$\\n\\nNow, use original equation with $x = c$:\\n\\n$f(c y + f(c^2)) = c f(c + y)$\\n\\nWe don't know $f(c^2)$\\n\\nBut we know $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$\\n\\nFor $x = c$: $f(f(c^2)) = c f(c) = c \\\\cdot 0 = 0$\\n\\nSo $f(f(c^2)) = 0$\\n\\nBut $f(c) = 0$, so if $f$ is injective, then $f(c^2) = c$, but not sure.\\n\\nAssume $f(x) = x$ is the only non-zero solution, and see if $c$ must be 0.\\n\\nTry to find $f(0)$ under assumption $f$ not zero.\\n\\nUse $y = -x$ again: $f(-x^2 + f(x^2)) = x f(0) = c x$\\n\\nBut also from earlier, $f(f(x^2) - x^2) = c x$\\n\\nSame thing.\\n\\nNow, suppose we let $u = x^2 \\\\ge 0$, then for all $u \\\\ge 0$, $f(f(u) - u) = c \\\\sqrt{u}$ or $c (-\\\\sqrt{u})$, but sign depends on $x$\\n\\nActually, $x = \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{u}$, so $c x = \\\\pm c \\\\sqrt{u}$\\n\\nBut left side $f(f(u) - u)$ depends only on $u$, not on sign of $x$, so $f(f(u) - u) = c x$ and also $= c (-x)$ if we take $-x$, so $c x = -c x$ for all $x$, which implies $2c x = 0$ for all $x$, so $c = 0$\\n\\nAh! Critical point!\\n\\nWhen we fix $u = x^2$, then $x = \\\\sqrt{u}$ or $x = -\\\\sqrt{u}$\\n\\nFor $x = \\\\sqrt{u}$: $f(f(u) - u) = c \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{u}$\\n\\nFor $x = -\\\\sqrt{u}$: $f(f(u) - u) = c \\\\cdot (-\\\\sqrt{u}) = -c \\\\sqrt{u}$\\n\\nBut left side is the same in both cases, since $u$ is same.\\n\\nSo $c \\\\sqrt{u} = -c \\\\sqrt{u}$ for all $u > 0$\\n\\nThus $2c \\\\sqrt{u} = 0$ for all $u > 0$, so $c = 0$\\n\\nTherefore, $f(0) = 0$\\n\\nGreat! So for any solution, $f(0) = 0$\\n\\nNow, recall that $f(f(x^2) - x^2) = c x = 0$ for all $x$\\n\\nSo $f(f(x^2) - x^2) = 0$ for all $x$\\n\\nNow, we want to show that $f(z) = 0$ implies $z = 0$, or at least that $f(x^2) - x^2 = 0$\\n\\nSuppose that $f(a) = 0$ for some $a$\\n\\nThen from earlier, setting $x + y = a$, we have $f(x(a - x) + f(x^2)) = 0$ for all $x$\\n\\nSince $f(0) = 0$, and if we assume that 0 is the only zero, then $x(a - x) + f(x^2) = 0$ for all $x$\\n\\nBut we don't know that.\\n\\nHowever, we have $f(f(x^2) - x^2) = 0$, so let $b_x = f(x^2) - x^2$, then $f(b_x) = 0$\\n\\nSo each $b_x$ is a root of $f$\\n\\nNow, if the only root is 0, then $b_x = 0$, so $f(x^2) = x^2$ for all $x$, so $f(t) = t$ for all $t \\\\ge 0$\\n\\nNow, need to find $f$ for negative numbers.\\n\\nNow, go back to original equation.\\n\\nWe also have $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$\\n\\nBut $f(x^2) = x^2$ (if we assume that), so $f(x^2) = x^2$, so $f(f(x^2)) = f(x^2) = x^2$\\n\\nAnd right-hand side: $x f(x)$\\n\\nSo $x^2 = x f(x)$\\n\\nFor $x \\\\ne 0$, divide: $f(x) = x$\\n\\nFor $x = 0$, $f(0) = 0$, so $f(x) = x$ for all $x$\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nSo if we can show that $f(z) = 0$ implies $z = 0$, then done.\\n\\nSo far, we know $f(0) = 0$, and $f(c) = 0$ but $c = 0$, so only one known zero.\\n\\nSuppose there is $a \\\\ne 0$ such that $f(a) = 0$\\n\\nThen from earlier: for all $x$, $f(x(a - x) + f(x^2)) = 0$\\n\\nSo the expression $x(a - x) + f(x^2)$ is a root of $f$\\n\\nNow, $x(a - x) = -x^2 + a x$, a downward parabola, maximum at $x = a/2$, value $a^2/4$\\n\\nSo as $x$ varies, $x(a - x)$ ranges over $(-\\\\infty, a^2/4]$\\n\\nNow, $f(x^2)$ is some value, but we don't know.\\n\\nBut the sum $s(x) = -x^2 + a x + f(x^2)$\\n\\nAnd $f(s(x)) = 0$ for all $x$\\n\\nSo $s(x)$ is in the zero set of $f$\\n\\nNow, if the zero set is finite, or discrete, but could be infinite.\\n\\nBut suppose $f$ is not identically zero, and $f(0) = 0$, and suppose $a \\\\ne 0$ with $f(a) = 0$\\n\\nNow, consider $x = 1$: $f(1 \\\\cdot (a - 1) + f(1)) = f(a - 1 + f(1))$\\n\\nBut $f(1) = 1$ (since if not, we would have $f \\\\equiv 0$, but we are assuming not), earlier we had that if $f$ not identically zero, then $f(1) = 1$\\n\\nYes, because otherwise periodic and forced to zero.\\n\\nSo $f(1) = 1$\\n\\nSo $f(a - 1 + 1) = f(a) = 0$, which is consistent.\\n\\nNow, $s(x) = -x^2 + a x + f(x^2)$\\n\\nNow, $f(x^2)$ is defined for $x^2$, and we might relate.\\n\\nNote that $s(x)$ is a function of $x$, and $f(s(x)) = 0$\\n\\nNow, if $s(x)$ takes infinitely many values, then $f$ has infinitely many zeros.\\n\\nBut perhaps we can find a contradiction.\\n\\nRecall that $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$\\n\\nNow, $f(x^2)$ is some number, and $f$ of it is $x f(x)$\\n\\nSuppose that for some $x$, $f(x^2) = a$, where $f(a) = 0$, then $f(f(x^2)) = f(a) = 0$, so $x f(x) = 0$\\n\\nSo either $x = 0$ or $f(x) = 0$\\n\\nBut $x = 0$: $f(x^2) = f(0) = 0$, and if $a \\\\ne 0$, not equal.\\n\\nSo if $f(x^2) = a \\\\ne 0$, then $x f(x) = 0$, so $f(x) = 0$ (since $x \\\\ne 0$ probably)\\n\\nBut $x$ such that $x^2$ is such that $f(x^2) = a$\\n\\nNow, back to $s(x) = -x^2 + a x + f(x^2)$\\n\\nSuppose that $f(x^2) = x^2$ for all $x$, but we don't know.\\n\\nAssume that $f$ is the identity on positives, but not necessarily.\\n\\nTry to plug in specific values.\\n\\nSet $x = 1$ in original equation:\\n\\n$f(y + f(1)) = 1 \\\\cdot f(1 + y) \\\\Rightarrow f(y + 1) = f(1 + y)$, trivial.\\n\\nSet $y = 1$:\\n\\n$f(x \\\\cdot 1 + f(x^2)) = x f(x + 1)$\\n\\nSo $f(x + f(x^2)) = x f(x + 1)$\\n\\nNot sure.\\n\\nFrom $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$, and $f(0) = 0$, $f(1) = 1$, $f(-1) = -1$\\n\\nTry $x = 2$:\\n\\n$f(f(4)) = 2 f(2)$\\n\\nLet $b = f(2)$, then $f(f(4)) = 2b$\\n\\nNow, if we can find another expression.\\n\\nSuppose that $f$ is odd? Not necessarily.\\n\\nCheck $f(-x)$.\\n\\nSet $y = 0$ in original: $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$, as before.\\n\\nSet $x = -1$:\\n\\n$f(-y + f(1)) = -1 \\\\cdot f(-1 + y) \\\\Rightarrow f(-y + 1) = - f(y - 1)$\\n\\nLet $z = y - 1$, then $f(-(z+1) + 1) = -f(z) \\\\Rightarrow f(-z) = -f(z)$\\n\\nOh! So $f$ is odd!\\n\\nBecause $f(-z) = -f(z)$ for all $z$\\n\\nGreat!\\n\\nSo $f$ is an odd function.\\n\\nNow, since $f$ is odd, and $f(0) = 0$, and we have $f(f(x^2) - x^2) = 0$ for all $x$\\n\\nNow, let $d(x) = f(x^2) - x^2$, then $f(d(x)) = 0$\\n\\nSince $f$ is odd, and $f(d(x)) = 0$, and $f(0) = 0$, but could be other zeros.\\n\\nBut $d(x) = f(x^2) - x^2$, and $x^2 \\\\ge 0$\\n\\nNow, $f(d(x)) = 0$\\n\\nSuppose that $d(x) = 0$ for all $x$, then $f(x^2) = x^2$, and as before, $f(f(x^2)) = f(x^2) = x^2 = x f(x)$, so for $x \\\\ne 0$, $f(x) = x$, and $f(0)=0$, so $f(x)=x$\\n\\nNow, suppose that for some $x$, $d(x) \\\\ne 0$, but $f(d(x)) = 0$\\n\\nSince $f$ is odd, if $d(x) \\\\ne 0$, then $-d(x)$ is also a zero if $f(-d(x)) = -f(d(x)) = 0$, so symmetric.\\n\\nBut now, from earlier, when we had $f(a) = 0$ for $a \\\\ne 0$, then $s(x) = -x^2 + a x + f(x^2)$ satisfies $f(s(x)) = 0$\\n\\nNow, $s(x) = -x^2 + a x + f(x^2)$\\n\\nAs $x \\\\to \\\\infty$, $-x^2$ dominates if $f(x^2)$ grows slower than $x^2$, but we don't know.\\n\\nSuppose that $f(x^2)$ is bounded, then $s(x) \\\\to -\\\\infty$ as $x \\\\to \\\\infty$, and $f(s(x)) = 0$\\n\\nSimilarly, as $x \\\\to -\\\\infty$, same.\\n\\nBut if $f$ has only finitely many zeros, contradiction, but could have infinitely many.\\n\\nSuppose that the set of zeros is bounded. Then since $s(x) \\\\to -\\\\infty$ as $|x| \\\\to \\\\infty$, for large $|x|$, $s(x)$ is large negative, not in zero set, contradiction.\\n\\nSo if $f$ has only finitely many zeros, then $s(x)$ eventually outside, contradiction.\\n\\nBut $f$ could have infinitely many zeros.\\n\\nHowever, we also have $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$\\n\\nThe left side, $f(f(x^2))$, if $f$ has many zeros, but $f(x^2)$ could avoid them.\\n\\nBut suppose that $f$ is not identically zero, $f(0)=0$, $f(1)=1$, etc.\\n\\nAssume that $f(x) = x$ for all $x$, which works, and $f=0$ works.\\n\\nNow, is there another?\\n\\nSuppose there is $a \\\\ne 0$ with $f(a) = 0$\\n\\nThen for all $x$, $f(-x^2 + a x + f(x^2)) = 0$\\n\\nNow, let me denote $g(x) = f(x^2)$\\n\\nThen $f(-x^2 + a x + g(x)) = 0$\\n\\nNow, $g(x) = f(x^2)$, and from $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$, so $f(g(x)) = x f(x)$\\n\\nNow, the argument $h(x) = -x^2 + a x + g(x)$, and $f(h(x)) = 0$\\n\\nNow, $h(x)$ is a function, and $f$ vanishes on its range.\\n\\nNow, suppose that $g(x)$ is not $x^2$, but something else.\\n\\nTry to set $x=1$: $h(1) = -1 + a + g(1) = -1 + a + f(1) = -1 + a + 1 = a$\\n\\nAnd $f(h(1)) = f(a) = 0$, good.\\n\\nSet $x=2$: $h(2) = -4 + 2a + f(4)$\\n\\n$f(h(2)) = 0$\\n\\nNow, $f(f(4)) = 2 f(2)$, from earlier.\\n\\nLet $b = f(2)$, $c = f(4)$\\n\\nThen $f(c) = 2b$\\n\\nAnd $h(2) = -4 + 2a + c$, and $f(-4 + 2a + c) = 0$\\n\\nSimilarly, for other values.\\n\\nThis seems messy.\\n\\nNote that since $f$ is odd, and $f(a) = 0$, then $f(-a) = -f(a) = 0$, so $-a$ is also a zero.\\n\\nNow, go back to the expression $f(xy + f(x^2)) = x f(x+y)$\\n\\nSuppose we fix $x$ and vary $y$, the right-hand side is $x f(x+y)$, which as $y$ varies, covers $x$ times the range of $f$.\\n\\nLeft-hand side is $f$ of some linear function in $y$.\\n\\nSpecifically, for fixed $x$, as $y$ varies, $xy + f(x^2)$ varies over all reals if $x \\\\ne 0$, since it's linear in $y$ with slope $x \\\\ne 0$.\\n\\nSo for fixed $x \\\\ne 0$, the argument $xy + f(x^2)$ runs over all reals as $y$ does.\\n\\nTherefore, $f(w)$ for $w \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ is equal to $x f(x + y)$, but $w = xy + f(x^2)$, so $y = (w - f(x^2))/x$\\n\\nThen $x + y = x + (w - f(x^2))/x = (x^2 + w - f(x^2))/x$\\n\\nSo $f(w) = x f\\\\left( \\\\frac{x^2 + w - f(x^2)}{x} \\\\right) = x f\\\\left( x + \\\\frac{w - f(x^2)}{x} \\\\right)$\\n\\nBetter: $f(w) = x f\\\\left( \\\\frac{w + x^2 - f(x^2)}{x} \\\\right)$\\n\\nFor each fixed $x \\\\ne 0$, and all $w$, \\n\\n$$ f(w) = x f\\\\left( \\\\frac{w + x^2 - f(x^2)}{x} \\\\right) $$\\n\\nLet $k_x = x^2 - f(x^2)$, so\\n\\n$$ f(w) = x f\\\\left( \\\\frac{w - k_x}{x} \\\\right) $$\\n\\nInteresting functional equation.\\n\\nNow, recall that $d(x) = f(x^2) - x^2 = -k_x$, and $f(d(x)) = 0$, so $f(-k_x) = 0$\\n\\nSo $f(k_x) = -f(-k_x) = 0$? No, $f(-k_x) = f(d(x)) = 0$, and since $f$ is odd, $f(k_x) = f(- (-k_x)) = - f(-k_x) = -0 = 0$\\n\\nIs that right? $f$ odd means $f(-z) = -f(z)$, so $f(-k_x) = -f(k_x)$\\n\\nBut $f(-k_x) = 0$, so $-f(k_x) = 0$, thus $f(k_x) = 0$\\n\\nSo $f(k_x) = 0$\\n\\nBut $k_x = x^2 - f(x^2)$, and $f(k_x) = 0$\\n\\nNow, in the equation:\\n\\n$$ f(w) = x f\\\\left( \\\\frac{w - k_x}{x} \\\\right) $$\\n\\nSince $f(k_x) = 0$, and $k_x$ is a zero.\\n\\nNow, suppose that $k_x = 0$ for all $x$, then $f(x^2) = x^2$, and as before, $f(x) = x$\\n\\nOtherwise, for some $x$, $k_x \\\\ne 0$, and $f(k_x) = 0$\\n\\nBut now, the equation says $f(w) = x f( \\\\frac{w - k_x}{x} )$\\n\\nThis must hold for each $x \\\\ne 0$\\n\\nIn particular, for a fixed $w$, this relates $f(w)$ to $f$ at another point.\\n\\nSuppose that $f$ is not identically zero, so there is some $w$ with $f(w) \\\\ne 0$\\n\\nBut also, since $f(1) = 1 \\\\ne 0$, ok.\\n\\nNow, take $x=1$: then $k_1 = 1^2 - f(1^2) = 1 - f(1) = 1 - 1 = 0$\\n\\nSo for $x=1$, $k_x = 0$, so $f(w) = 1 \\\\cdot f( \\\\frac{w - 0}{1} ) = f(w)$, tautology.\\n\\nTake $x=2$: $k_2 = 4 - f(4)$\\n\\nLet $c = f(4)$, so $k_2 = 4 - c$\\n\\nAnd $f(k_2) = f(4 - c) = 0$\\n\\nNow, $f(w) = 2 f( \\\\frac{w - (4 - c)}{2} ) = 2 f( \\\\frac{w - 4 + c}{2} )$\\n\\nIn particular, for $w=0$: $f(0) = 0 = 2 f( \\\\frac{0 - 4 + c}{2} ) = 2 f( \\\\frac{c - 4}{2} )$\\n\\nSo $2 f( \\\\frac{c - 4}{2} ) = 0$, so $f( \\\\frac{c - 4}{2} ) = 0$\\n\\nBut we already know $f(4 - c) = 0$, and since $f$ is odd, $f(c - 4) = -f(4 - c) = 0$, so $f(c - 4) = 0$\\n\\nNow, $ \\\\frac{c - 4}{2} $ is half of $c-4$, and $f$ of it is 0.\\n\\nSimilarly, we can iterate.\\n\\nBut also, from earlier, $f(f(4)) = f(c) = 2 f(2)$\\n\\nLet $b = f(2)$, so $f(c) = 2b$\\n\\nNow, if $b = 0$, then $f(c) = 0$\\n\\nBut $c = f(4)$, so $f(f(4)) = 0$\\n\\nBut $f(f(4)) = 2 f(2) = 0$, yes.\\n\\nNow, suppose $b = f(2) = 0$\\n\\nThen $f(c) = 0$\\n\\nAnd $f(4 - c) = 0$, $f(c - 4) = 0$, $f( \\\\frac{c-4}{2} ) = 0$, etc.\\n\\nNow, also, for $x=2$, $f(w) = 2 f( \\\\frac{w - 4 + c}{2} )$\\n\\nSet $w=2$: $f(2) = 0 = 2 f( \\\\frac{2 - 4 + c}{2} ) = 2 f( \\\\frac{c - 2}{2} )$\\n\\nSo $f( \\\\frac{c - 2}{2} ) = 0$\\n\\nSimilarly, set $w=1$: $f(1) = 1 = 2 f( \\\\frac{1 - 4 + c}{2} ) = 2 f( \\\\frac{c - 3}{2} )$\\n\\nSo $f( \\\\frac{c - 3}{2} ) = \\\\frac{1}{2}$\\n\\nNow, this is non-zero, so ok.\\n\\nBut we have many points where $f$ is zero.\\n\\nNow, also, from $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$, for $x=2$, $f(f(4)) = f(c) = 2b = 0$, since $b=0$\\n\\nFor $x=3$, let $d = f(9)$, then $f(d) = 3 f(3)$\\n\\nAnd $k_3 = 9 - d$, $f(k_3) = 0$\\n\\nAnd $f(w) = 3 f( \\\\frac{w - 9 + d}{3} )$\\n\\nSet $w=1$: $f(1) = 1 = 3 f( \\\\frac{1 - 9 + d}{3} ) = 3 f( \\\\frac{d - 8}{3} )$\\n\\nSo $f( \\\\frac{d - 8}{3} ) = \\\\frac{1}{3}$\\n\\nNow, back to $x=2$, we have $f( \\\\frac{c - 3}{2} ) = \\\\frac{1}{2}$\\n\\nBut $c = f(4)$, unknown.\\n\\nNow, also, since $f(2) = 0$, and $f$ is odd, $f(-2) = 0$\\n\\nNow, use the original equation with $x=2$, $y$ arbitrary:\\n\\n$f(2y + f(4)) = 2 f(2 + y)$\\n\\nSo $f(2y + c) = 2 f(2 + y)$\\n\\nNow, left side is $f$ of linear in $y$, right side is 2 times $f$ shifted.\\n\\nSince $f( \\\\frac{c - 3}{2} ) = \\\\frac{1}{2}$, let $z = \\\\frac{c - 3}{2}$, so $f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{2}$\\n\\nThen $c = 2z + 3$\\n\\nNow, the equation $f(2y + c) = 2 f(2 + y)$\\n\\nSubstitute $c = 2z + 3$: $f(2y + 2z + 3) = 2 f(2 + y)$\\n\\nLet $u = y + 1$, then $f(2(u - 1) + 2z + 3) = 2 f(2 + u - 1) \\\\Rightarrow f(2u + 2z + 1) = 2 f(u + 1)$\\n\\nSo $f(2u + 2z + 1) = 2 f(u + 1)$\\n\\nNow, this must hold for all $u$.\\n\\nNow, also, we know that $f$ has many zeros, for example $f(4 - c) = f(4 - (2z + 3)) = f(1 - 2z) = 0$\\n\\nSimilarly, $f(c - 4) = f(2z + 3 - 4) = f(2z - 1) = 0$\\n\\nAnd $f( \\\\frac{c-4}{2} ) = f( \\\\frac{2z+3-4}{2} ) = f( \\\\frac{2z -1}{2} ) = f(z - 0.5) = 0$\\n\\nSimilarly, $f( \\\\frac{c-2}{2} ) = f( \\\\frac{2z+3-2}{2} ) = f( \\\\frac{2z+1}{2} ) = f(z + 0.5) = 0$\\n\\nAnd $f( \\\\frac{c-3}{2} ) = f(z) = 0.5$\\n\\nNow, so we have:\\n\\n$f(z) = 0.5$\\n\\n$f(z - 0.5) = 0$\\n\\n$f(z + 0.5) = 0$\\n\\n$f(2z - 1) = 0$\\n\\n$f(1 - 2z) = 0$\\n\\nNow, use the equation $f(2u + 2z + 1) = 2 f(u + 1)$\\n\\nSet $u = z - 1$: then left side $f(2(z-1) + 2z + 1) = f(2z - 2 + 2z + 1) = f(4z -1)$\\n\\nRight side $2 f((z-1) + 1) = 2 f(z) = 2 * 0.5 = 1$\\n\\nSo $f(4z - 1) = 1$\\n\\nSet $u = -0.5$: left side $f(2*(-0.5) + 2z + 1) = f(-1 + 2z + 1) = f(2z)$\\n\\nRight side $2 f(-0.5 + 1) = 2 f(0.5)$\\n\\nSo $f(2z) = 2 f(0.5)$\\n\\nSet $u = 0$: $f(0 + 2z + 1) = f(2z + 1) = 2 f(1) = 2*1 = 2$\\n\\nSo $f(2z + 1) = 2$\\n\\nSet $u = -1$: $f(2*(-1) + 2z + 1) = f(-2 + 2z + 1) = f(2z -1) = 0$ (from earlier)\\n\\nRight side $2 f(-1 + 1) = 2 f(0) = 0$, good.\\n\\nNow, we have $f(2z + 1) = 2$\\n\\nBut also $f(2z - 1) = 0$\\n\\nNow, recall that $f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)$\\n\\nFor $x=1$, $f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1 = 1*f(1)$, good.\\n\\nFor $x=3$, $f(f(9)) = 3 f(3)$\\n\\nLet $e = f(3)$, $d = f(9)$, so $f(d) = 3e$\\n\\nFrom $x=3$ in the general formula: $f(w) = 3 f( \\\\frac{w - 9 + d}{3} )$\\n\\nSet $w=1$: $f(1) = 1 = 3 f( \\\\frac{1-9+d}{3} ) = 3 f( \\\\frac{d-8}{3} )$, so $f( \\\\frac{d-8}{3} ) = 1/3$\\n\\nNow, this is getting complicated, but notice that in the expression $f(2u + 2z + 1) = 2 f(u + 1)$, the right side is 2 times $f$ at $u+1$, which could be anything, but left side is $f$ at a point.\\n\\nSuppose that $f$ is linear, but we already tried.\\n\\nPerhaps the only way is if there are no extra zeros, so $k_x = 0$ for all x.\\n\\nAssume that f is the identity, or zero.\\n\\nTry to see if f(2) can be 0.\\n\\nSuppose f(2) = 0.\\n\\nThen from f(f(4)) = 2 f(2) = 0, so f(f(4)) = 0\\n\\nLet c = f(4), so f(c) = 0\\n\\nFrom earlier, f(2y + c) = 2 f(2 + y)\\n\\nNow, set y = 0: f(0 + c) = f(c) = 0 = 2 f(2) = 0, good.\\n\\nSet y = 1: f(2*1 + c) = f(2 + c) = 2 f(3)\\n\\nSet y = -1: f(2*(-1) + c) = f(-2 + c) = 2 f(1) = 2*1 = 2\\n\\nSo f(c - 2) = 2\\n\\nBut earlier, from x=2, we had f( \\\\frac{c-2}{2} ) = 0, and f(c-4) = 0, etc.\\n\\nNow, f(c - 2) = 2\\n\\nAlso, since f(c) = 0, and f is odd.\\n\\nNow, use the fact that for x=1, but not helpful.\\n\\nUse x=3.\\n\\nBut perhaps set in the original equation x=2, y such that 2+y =1, so y= -1, which we did, got f(c-2) =2\\n\\nSet x=2, y=0: f(f(4)) = f(c) =0 =2 f(2) =0, good.\\n\\nNow, set x=4.\\n\\nFirst, f(f(16)) = 4 f(4) = 4c\\n\\nLet d = f(16), so f(d) = 4c\\n\\nAlso, k_4 = 16 - d, f(k_4) =0\\n\\nAnd f(w) = 4 f( \\\\frac{w - 16 + d}{4} )\\n\\nNow, also, from x=2, we have f(2y + c) = 2 f(2 + y)\\n\\nSuppose that c is known, but it's not.\\n\\nFrom earlier with z, we had f(2z +1) =2, and f(z) =0.5, etc.\\n\\nBut also f(z +0.5) =0, f(z -0.5) =0\\n\\nNow, set in the equation f(2u + 2z +1) =2 f(u+1)\\n\\nSet u = z: left side f(2z + 2z +1) = f(4z +1)\\n\\nRight side 2 f(z+1)\\n\\nSo f(4z+1) = 2 f(z+1)\\n\\nWe also have f(4z -1) =1 from earlier.\\n\\nNow, if we assume that f is differentiable or something, but not.\\n\\nPerhaps try to see if this leads to contradiction.\\n\\nFor example, we have f(z - 0.5) = 0, f(z) = 0.5, f(z + 0.5) = 0\\n\\nSo around z, it goes 0, 0.5, 0, so not monotonic.\\n\\nBut also f(2z +1) =2, f(2z -1) =0\\n\\nNow, no immediate contradiction.\\n\\nBut let's use the original equation with x=1, y=z-1: f(1*(z-1) + f(1)) = 1* f(1 + z -1) => f(z-1 +1) = f(z) => f(z) = f(z), good.\\n\\nWith x=z, but z might not be nice.\\n\\nPerhaps the only simple solutions are f=0 and f(x)=x.\\n\\nMoreover, in competitions, usually these are the only solutions.\\n\\nAssume that f(x) = x for all x, works; f=0 works.\\n\\nNow, is there a solution where f(2) =0?\\n\\nSuppose f(2) =0, f(1) =1, f(0)=0, f(-1)= -1, f(-2)=0\\n\\nFrom f(c -2) =2, and c = f(4)\\n\\nAlso from f(f(4)) = f(c) =0\\n\\nNow, use x=4, y=0: f(f(16)) =4 f(4) =4c\\n\\nBut f(f(16)) = f(d) where d=f(16), and f(d) =4c\\n\\nNow, also, for x=4, f(w) =4 f( (w -16 +d)/4 )\\n\\nSet w=2: f(2) =0 =4 f( (2-16+d)/4 ) =4 f( (d-14)/4 )\\n\\nSo f( (d-14)/4 ) =0\\n\\nSimilarly, many points.\\n\\nBut also, set in the equation for x=2: f(2y + c) =2 f(2+y)\\n\\nSet y=2: f(4 + c) =2 f(4) =2c\\n\\nSet y= -2: f(-4 + c) =2 f(0) =0\\n\\nSo f(c-4) =0, which we already have.\\n\\nNow, set y such that 2+y = z, but z is not defined.\\n\\nPerhaps assume a value.\\n\\nSuppose that c = f(4) = 4, then f(c) = f(4) =4, but f(c) =0, so 4=0, contradiction.\\n\\nIf c=0, then f(c) =f(0)=0, good.\\n\\nThen f(c-2) = f(-2) =0, but should be 2, so 0=2, contradiction.\\n\\nIf c=2, then f(c) =f(2) =0, good.\\n\\nThen f(c-2) = f(0) =0, should be 2, 0=2, contradiction.\\n\\nIf c=4, f(c)=f(4)=c=4, but should be 0, 4=0, no.\\n\\nIf c= -2, then f(c) =f(-2) = -f(2) = -0 =0, good.\\n\\nThen f(c-2) = f(-2-2) = f(-4) = -f(4) = -c = -(-2) =2, and it should be 2, good!\\n\\nSo c = f(4) = -2, then f(c-2) = f(-4) = -f(4) = -(-2) =2, and we need it to be 2, perfect.\\n\\nSo possible.\\n\\nSo f(4) = -2, f(2) =0, f(c) = f(-2) =0, which is good since f(2)=0, and f is odd, f(-2)=0.\\n\\nNow, continue.\\n\\nFrom earlier, for x=2, f(2y + c) = f(2y -2) =2 f(2+y)\\n\\nSo f(2y -2) =2 f(2+y)\\n\\nLet v = y+2, then f(2(v-2) -2) =2 f(v) => f(2v -4 -2) = f(2v -6) =2 f(v)\\n\\nSo f(2v -6) =2 f(v) for all v.\\n\\nNow, also, we have f(f(4)) = f(-2) =0, and 2 f(2) =0, good.\\n\\nNow, f(f(x^2)) = x f(x)\\n\\nFor x=4, f(f(16)) =4 f(4) =4*(-2) = -8\\n\\nLet d = f(16), so f(d) = -8\\n\\nAlso, from the general formula for x=4: f(w) =4 f( (w -16 +d)/4 )\\n\\nNow, also, from the recurrence f(2v -6) =2 f(v)\\n\\nApply repeatedly.\\n\\nFor example, f(v) = (1/2) f(2v -6)\\n\\nThen f(2v -6) = (1/2) f(2(2v-6) -6) = (1/2) f(4v -12 -6) = (1/2) f(4v -18)\\n\\nSo f(v) = (1/2) * (1/2) f(4v -18) = (1/4) f(4v -18)\\n\\nSimilarly, f(v) = (1/8) f(8v - 54), and so on.\\n\\nIn general, f(v) = (1/2^n) f(2^n v - 6(2^{n-1} + 2^{n-2} + ... + 1)) = (1/2^n) f(2^n v - 6(2^n -1))\\n\\nSum of geometric: 2^{n-1} + ... + 1 = 2^n -1\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo f(v) = 2^{-n} f(2^n v -

(v-6)/5 = (6-v)/5\\n\\nNow, check f(2) = (6-2)/5 =4/5, but we assumed f(2)=0, contradiction.\\n\\nIf f(w) ~ c |w|^alpha with alpha>1, then 2^{-n} |2^n (v-6)|^alpha = 2^{-n} 2^{n alpha} |v-6|^alpha = 2^{n(alpha-1)} |v-6|^alpha → ∞ as n→∞, while f(v) is fixed, so unless f(v)=0, contradiction, but if f(v)≠0, then for large n, the right side large, but left side fixed, contradiction.\\n\\nTherefore, the only possibility is that f(v) =0 for all v, but f(1)=1, contradiction.\\n\\nTherefore, our assumption that f(2)=0 must be false.\\n\\nThus, for the non-zero solution, f(2) ≠ 0, and similarly, no extra zeros, so f(x^2) = x^2 for all x, so f(x) = x for all x.\\n\\nTherefore, the only solutions are f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x.\\n\\nNow, verify both:\\n\\n1. f(x) = 0: LHS f(xy + f(x^2)) = f(xy + 0) = f(xy) = 0, RHS x f(x+y) = x * 0 = 0, good.\\n\\n2. f(x) = x: LHS f(xy + f(x^2)) = f(xy + x^2) = xy + x^2, RHS x f(x+y) = x(x+y) = x^2 + xy, good.\\n\\nSo both work.\\n\\nProblem 2: Find all positive integers relatively prime to all terms of the sequence a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 for n≥1.\\n\\nThat is, find positive integers k such that gcd(k, a_n) = 1 for all n≥1.\\n\\nEquivalently, k shares no common prime factor with any a_n.\\n\\nSo, if a prime p divides k, then p must not divide any a_n.\\n\\nBut we want k such that for every n, gcd(k, a_n)=1, so no prime dividing k divides any a_n.\\n\\nBut since k is composed of primes, we need that no prime divisor of k divides any a_n.\\n\\nBut actually, it's that for each n, no prime dividing k divides a_n, but since it must hold for all n, we need that no prime dividing k divides a_n for any n, i.e., the prime does not divide any term of the sequence.\\n\\nSo, the set of such k is the set of positive integers whose prime factors are not in the set of prime divisors of the sequence {a_n}.\\n\\nBut the problem asks for all positive integers relatively prime to all terms, which means that k is coprime to each a_n individually.\\n\\nFor k to be coprime to a_n for every n, it means that k shares no common prime factor with a_n for each n.\\n\\nBut since the a_n may have different prime factors, k must not be divisible by any prime that divides at least one a_n.\\n\\nIn other words, the prime factors of k must be disjoint from the union of the prime factors of all a_n.\\n\\nSo, first, find the set S of all primes that divide at least one a_n for some n≥1.\\n\\nThen the positive integers relatively prime to all a_n are exactly those whose prime factors are not in S, i.e., coprime to the product of all primes in S, but since S may be infinite, it's the integers composed of primes not in S.\\n\\nBut the answer might be that only 1 satisfies, or small numbers.\\n\\nCompute the first few a_n.\\n\\na_1 = 2^1 + 3^1 + 6^1 -1 = 2+3+6-1=10\\n\\na_2 = 4 + 9 + 36 -1 = 48\\n\\na_3 = 8 + 27 + 216 -1 = 250\\n\\na_4 = 16 + 81 + 1296 -1 = 1392\\n\\na_5 = 32 + 243 + 7776 -1 = 8050\\n\\nNow, factor them:\\n\\na_1 = 10 = 2 * 5\\n\\na_2 = 48 = 16 * 3 = 2^4 * 3\\n\\na_3 = 250 = 2 * 125 = 2 * 5^3\\n\\na_4 = 1392, divide by 2: 696, again 348, 174, 87, so 2^4 * 87, 87=3*29, so 2^4 * 3 * 29\\n\\na_5 = 8050 = 50 * 161 = 2*25 * 7*23 = 2 * 5^2 * 7 * 23\\n\\nSo far, primes appearing: 2,3,5,7,23,29\\n\\nNow, a_6 = 2^6 + 3^6 + 6^6 -1 = 64 + 729 + 46656 -1 = 47450 -1? 64+729=793, +46656=47449, minus 1=47448\\n\\n47448 /2=23724, /2=11862, /2=5931, 5931 div 3: 5+9+3+1=18 div3, 5931/3=1977, 1977/3=659, 659 is prime?

p.\\n\\nNote that a_n = 6^n + 2^n + 3^n -1\\n\\nFor p>3, by Fermat, 2^{p-1} ≡1 mod p if p not divide 2, similarly for 3,6.\\n\\nBut n can be chosen.\\n\\nThe sequence a_n mod p is periodic with period dividing lcm(p-1,p-1,p-1)=p-1 for p>3, since the exponents repeat every p-1 by Fermat.\\n\\n2^n mod p has period dividing p-1, similarly for 3^n, 6^n.\\n\\nSo a_n mod p is periodic with period dividing p-1.\\n\\nNow, if a_n not ≡0 mod p for all n=1,2,...,p-1, then since period p-1, never 0.\\n\\nBut we can check if 0 is in the range.\\n\\nNote that for n=1, a_1=10, so if p>10 and p does not divide 10, i.e., p≠2,5, then a_1 not 0 mod p.\\n\\nBut for larger n.\\n\\nSuppose that for some p, a_n never 0 mod p.\\n\\nThen 6^n + 2^n + 3^n ≡1 mod p for all n, but that can't be since it varies.\\n\\nThe values are determined, and we need that 1 is not in the image of the function n |-> 6^n + 2^n + 3^n mod p.\\n\\nBut for large p, it might miss 1.\\n\\nTry p=41.\\n\\nCompute a_n mod 41 for n=1 to 40, but tedious.\\n\\nNote that when n is multiple of the exponent, but perhaps try n=p-1.\\n\\nBy Fermat, 2^{p-1} ≡1, 3^{p-1}≡1, 6^{p-1}≡1 mod p for p not dividing 2,3,6, i.e., p>3.\\n\\nSo a_{p-1} = 1 + 1 + 1 -1 =2 ≢0 mod p for p>2.\\n\\nNot helpful.\\n\\nTry n=1: a_1=10\\n\\nn=2:48\\n\\netc.\\n\\nSuppose that the only solution is k=1.\\n\\nBut is there any prime that doesn't divide any a_n?\\n\\nAfter searching online or thinking, perhaps p=1, but not.\\n\\nAnother thought: when n is even, or odd.\\n\\nNote that a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n -1\\n\\nFor n even, say n=2m, then a_{2m} = (2^m)^2 + (3^m)^2 + (6^m)^2 -1\\n\\nNot obviously factorable.\\n\\nPerhaps consider that for p=3, a_2=48≡0, etc.\\n\\nTry p=43.\\n\\nRather than compute, assume that it always happens, or look for a pattern.\\n\\nNotice that in the expression (2^n +1)(3^n +1) ≡2 mod p, this is equivalent to the existence of n such that this holds.\\n\\nFor p=2, a_1=10≡0 mod 2, so yes.\\n\\np=3, a_2=48≡0 mod 3, yes.\\n\\np=5, a_1=10≡0, yes.\\n\\nNow, is there a prime for which 2 is not in the range of (2^n+1)(3^n+1) mod p?\\n\\nFor example, if p=7, earlier a_5=8050÷7=1150, yes.\\n\\np=11, a_8 divisible, yes.\\n\\nPerhaps all primes work.\\n\\nBut let's try p=1, not.\\n\\nOr p=0, not.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps when n=0, but n≥1, a_0=2^0+3^0+6^0-1=1+1+1-1=2, but n≥1, so not considered.\\n\\nBut a_0=2, so if included, but not.\\n\\nNow, suppose that for a prime p, if 2 is a quadratic residue or something, but not clear.\\n\\nPerhaps the only positive integer relatively prime to all a_n is 1, since every prime divides some a_n.\\n\\nTo confirm, try a prime not in the first few, say p=47.\\n\\nCompute if there is n with a_n ≡0 mod 47.\\n\\na_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n -1 ≡0

Yes, 48-47=1, so a_22 ≡0 mod 47.\\n\\nSo 47 divides a_22.\\n\\nThus, it seems that for every prime p, there is some n such that p divides a_n.\\n\\nTherefore, the only positive integer that is relatively prime to all a_n is 1, since any k>1 has a prime factor, which must divide some a_n, so gcd(k, a_n) ≥ p >1 for that n.\\n\\nHence, only k=1.\\n\\nSo answer to problem 2 is 1.\\n\\nFinal answers.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
