The constraint is that she can only eat a piece if it is adjacent (orthogonally) to at most two other uneaten pieces. This means that when she eats a piece, the number of adjacent (up/down/left/right) pieces that are still present must be ≤2.\\n\\nBut note: this condition applies to the state *before* eating the piece. So at the moment she eats a piece, at most two of its orthogonally adjacent positions must contain sushi — i.e., the degree of that vertex in the current graph of uneaten pieces must be ≤2.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of permutations of the 6 vertices (pieces) such that when we reverse the order (i.e., simulate adding pieces one by one), each new piece added has at most two neighbors already present. This is a known type of problem involving 'elimination orderings' with degree constraints.\\n\\nAlternatively, think of the eating order as a sequence where each piece eaten must have at most two neighbors still uneaten (i.e., not yet eaten). Wait — correction: when she eats a piece, the number of adjacent pieces that are *still there* (i.e., not yet eaten) must be ≤2? No: the condition is that the piece being eaten must be adjacent to at most two other pieces *that are already gone*? That doesn’t make sense.\\n\\nLet’s re-read: \\\"Wendy can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other pieces.\\\" But all pieces start off being adjacent to some others. The key is: at the time she eats a piece, how many of its neighbors are still present?\\n\\nActually, the rule is likely about the current configuration: she can eat a piece only if, at that moment, it has at most two adjacent pieces remaining (i.e., it's on the 'edge' of the remaining sushi).\\n\\nSo: she can eat a piece only if it has degree ≤2 in the current subgraph of uneaten pieces.\\n\\nWe are to count the number of elimination orders (permutations of the 6 pieces) such that at each step, the piece being removed has at most two neighbors among the currently remaining pieces.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of 'degree-constrained elimination sequences' on a 2×3 grid graph, where at each step, the removed vertex has degree ≤2 in the current graph.\\n\\nNote: In graph theory, such sequences are related to 'k-degenerate' orderings, but here the constraint is on the degree *at removal*, and we require deg ≤2.\\n\\nThe 2×3 grid graph has 6 vertices. Let’s label them:\\n\\nA B C\\nD E F\\n\\nAdjacencies:\\n- A: B, D\\n- B: A, C, E\\n- C: B, F\\n- D: A, E\\n- E: B, D, F\\n- F: C, E\\n\\nSo degrees in full graph:\\n- A: 2\\n- B: 3\\n- C: 2\\n- D: 2\\n- E: 3\\n- F: 2\\n\\nVertices B and E have degree 3; others have degree 2.\\n\\nAt the very beginning, only vertices with degree ≤2 can be eaten. So initially, A, C, D, F can be eaten (degree 2), but B and E (degree 3) cannot be eaten first.\\n\\nSo first move: 4 choices (A, C, D, F).\\n\\nAfter removing one, say A, update the graph:\\n- B now connected to C, E (degree 2)\\n- D connected to E (degree 1)\\nOthers unchanged.\\nNow degrees: B:2, C:2, D:1, E:3, F:2 → E still has degree 3, so cannot be eaten yet.\\nSo available: B (2), C (2), D (1), F (2) — all have degree ≤2 now except E.\\nWait: E is connected to B, D, F — all still present? After removing A, B, D, F are still there, so E still has 3 neighbors. So E cannot be eaten until at least one of B, D, F is removed.\\n\\nBut now all others have degree ≤2, so any of B,C,D,F can be eaten next.\\n\\nThis seems complex. Perhaps we can model this as counting linear extensions of a poset or use dynamic programming over subsets.\\n\\nSince there are only 6 vertices, we can in principle compute the number of valid elimination sequences using recursion and memoization.\\n\\nBut since this is a reasoning exercise, let’s try to find a pattern or known result.\\n\\nAlternatively, note that the 2×3 grid is a small bipartite graph. Let’s denote the two partitions:\\n- Top row: A,B,C\\n- Bottom row: D,E,F\\nWith vertical edges: A-D, B-E, C-F\\nHorizontal: A-B, B-C, D-E, E-F\\n\\nAnother idea: this kind of elimination order (removing vertices of degree ≤2) is always possible in a graph with maximum degree 3, and in fact, any graph with maximum degree Δ is (Δ-1)-degenerate, but here we want exact count.\\n\\nI recall that for a path or cycle, such counts are known, but for a grid?\\n\\nPerhaps we can write a recurrence.\\n\\nBut let’s instead consider symmetry and cases.\\n\\nTotal number of valid eating orders = number of permutations π of the 6 pieces such that when we remove vertices in order π(1) to π(6), at the time of removal, each vertex has at most two neighbors remaining (i.e., not yet removed).\\n\\nEquivalently, in the reverse process (adding vertices one by one), each added vertex has at most two neighbors already present.\\n\\nSo define f(S) = number of ways to build up subset S such that each vertex was added when it had ≤2 neighbors already in the set.\\n\\nWe want f(full set).\\n\\nWe can do DP over subsets. There are 2^6 = 64 subsets, manageable.\\n\\nLet’s list all subsets and compute the number of valid sequences that build them under the rule.\\n\\nBut since the answer is likely a nice number, perhaps we can find it.\\n\\nNote: In the reverse process, we start from empty, add vertices one by one, each new vertex must have at most two neighbors already in the set.\\n\\nWe can use recursion: let F(S) = number of valid sequences to reach set S (i.e., number of ways to order the addition of vertices in S satisfying the condition).\\n\\nThen F(empty) = 1\\nFor non-empty S, F(S) = sum over v in S such that deg_S(v) ≤ 2 of F(S \\\\ {v})\\nwhere deg_S(v) is the number of neighbors of v in S (including v itself? no, just neighbors).\\n\\nBut note: when we add v to S\\\\{v}, the number of neighbors already in S\\\\{v} must be ≤2. So deg_{S\\\\{v}}(v) ≤2, but actually, when we add v, the neighbors already present are N(v) ∩ (S\\\\{v}), so yes, |N(v) ∩ (S\\\\{v})| ≤2.\\n\\nSo F(S) = sum_{v ∈ S and |N(v) ∩ (S\\\\{v})| ≤2} F(S \\\\ {v})\\n\\nWe can compute this for all subsets.\\n\\nLabel vertices:\\n0: A (top-left)\\n1: B (top-middle)\\n2: C (top-right)\\n3: D (bottom-left)\\n4: E (bottom-middle)\\n5: F (bottom-right)\\n\\nEdges:\\nA(0): B(1), D(3)\\nB(1): A(0), C(2), E(4)\\nC(2): B(1), F(5)\\nD(3): A(0), E(4)\\nE(4): B(1), D(3), F(5)\\nF(5): C(2), E(4)\\n\\nSo adjacency list:\\n0: [1,3]\\n1: [0,2,4]\\n2: [1,5]\\n3: [0,4]\\n4: [1,3,5]\\n5: [2,4]\\n\\nNow we compute F(S) for all subsets S ⊆ {0,1,2,3,4,5}\\n\\nWe’ll iterate by size from 0 to 6.\\n\\nSize 0: S=∅, F(∅)=1\\n\\nSize 1: all singletons. For each v, when adding v to empty, |N(v) ∩ ∅| = 0 ≤2, so allowed.\\nSo F({v}) = F(∅) = 1 for each v.\\nThere are 6 singletons, so F(S)=1 for each |S|=1.\\n\\nSize 2: all 2-element subsets.\\nFor each pair {u,v}, F({u,v}) = sum over w in {u,v} such that |N(w) ∩ ({u,v}\\\\{w})| ≤2 of F({u,v}\\\\{w})\\nBut F(single) =1, so we just need to check for each vertex in the pair whether it could be added second.\\n\\nBut F(S) counts the number of sequences, so for a 2-element set, it's the number of valid orders: which one was added first, then second.\\n\\nTo compute F(S) for |S|=2, we sum over v in S such that when v is added last, it has ≤2 neighbors already in S\\\\{v}. Since |S\\\\{v}|=1, the number of neighbors in a single-vertex set is at most 1 (if the other vertex is neighbor), so always ≤2. So every vertex can be added second.\\n\\nMoreover, the first vertex: when added to empty, always allowed.\\n\\nSo for any 2-element set, both orders are valid? Not necessarily: we need that the second vertex has ≤2 neighbors in the first. Since only one vertex is present, at most one neighbor, so yes, always ≤2. So every 2-element subset has F(S)=2.\\n\\nNumber of 2-element subsets: C(6,2)=15, each contributes 2, but we store per subset.\\n\\nBut we need F(S) for each S, but actually we only care about the total for full set, but we need to compute cumulatively.\\n\\nActually, we can compute iteratively.\\n\\nLet me make a table.\\n\\nWe'll compute F(S) for all S.\\n\\nUse bitmask: 6 bits, 0 to 63.\\n\\nS=0: 000000 -> F=1\\n\\nS with one bit:\\n000001 (0): F=1\\n000010 (1): F=1\\n000100 (2): F=1\\n001000 (3): F=1\\n010000 (4): F=1\\n100000 (5): F=1\\n\\nNow size 2:\\nFor each pair, F(S) = sum over v in S of F(S\\\\{v}) if |N(v) ∩ (S\\\\{v})| ≤2\\nBut as argued, |N(v) ∩ (S\\\\{v})| ≤1 <3, so always true. And F(S\\\\{v})=1, and there are two choices for v (which one was added last), so F(S)=2 for each 2-element S.\\n\\nSimilarly, for size 3: for each 3-element subset S, F(S) = sum over v in S such that |N(v) ∩ (S\\\\{v})| ≤2 of F(S\\\\{v})\\nNow |N(v) ∩ (S\\\\{v})| is the number of neighbors of v in S excluding v, i.e., degree in the induced subgraph on S.\\nBut we need the number of neighbors in S\\\\{v}, which is exactly the degree of v in the induced subgraph on S.\\nSo condition is deg_S(v) ≤2.\\nAnd F(S\\\\{v}) is known (from size 2, all are 2? No: F(T) for |T|=2 is 2, but it's the number of sequences to build T, which is 2 for each 2-element set.\\n\\nBut F(S\\\\{v}) depends on S\\\\{v}, and for different S\\\\{v}, it might be different, but in this case, all 2-element sets have F=2.\\n\\nIs that true? Yes, as above.\\n\\nSo for each v in S, if deg_S(v) ≤2, then we can add v last, and there are F(S\\\\{v}) = 2 ways to build the first two.\\nSo F(S) = sum_{v in S, deg_S(v) ≤2} 2\\n\\nBut only if the condition holds.\\n\\nNow deg_S(v) ≤2 is almost always true, since max degree in the whole graph is 3, but in a 3-vertex subgraph, max degree is at most 2? No, if three vertices form a star, but in our graph, maximum clique is 2, no triangles.\\n\\nCheck if any 3 vertices include a vertex of degree 3 in the subgraph.\\n\\nFor example, take S={1,4,0}: vertices B,E,A\\nEdges: A-B, B-E, A-D but D not in, E connected to B and D, but D not in.\\nSo in S: A-B, B-E, and A-E? No. So edges: A-B, B-E. So degrees: A:1, B:2, E:1. All ≤2.\\n\\nAnother: S={1,4,2}: B,E,C\\nEdges: B-C, B-E, C-F not, E-F not. So B-C, B-E. Degrees: B:2, C:1, E:1.\\n\\nS={1,4,3}: B,E,D\\nEdges: B-E, D-E, A-D but A not in, B-D? No. So B-E, D-E. Degrees: B:1, E:2, D:1.\\n\\nS={1,4,5}: B,E,F\\nEdges: B-E, E-F, C-F but C not in. So B-E, E-F. Degrees: B:1, E:2, F:1.\\n\\nNow what if we take three vertices including E and two of its neighbors, say {1,3,4}: B,D,E\\nAs above, degrees: B:1 (to E), D:1 (to E), E:2 (to B,D). All good.\\n\\nIs there a vertex that could have degree 3 in a 3-vertex subgraph? Only if it has three neighbors in the subgraph, but each vertex has at most three neighbors, but to have degree 3 in a 3-vertex set, it would need to be connected to the other two, but also to itself? No, degree is number of neighbors, so in a 3-vertex set, maximum degree is 2. Oh!\\n\\nIn any graph, in a set of size k, the maximum degree is at most k-1. So for k=3, max degree is 2. So for every 3-vertex subset, every vertex has degree at most 2 in the induced subgraph.\\n\\nTherefore, for every v in S, deg_S(v) ≤2, so the condition is always satisfied.\\n\\nThus, for each v in S, we can add v last, and F(S\\\\{v}) = 2 (since |S\\\\{v}|=2, and we established F(T)=2 for all |T|=2)\\n\\nThere are 3 choices for v, so F(S) = sum over 3 v's of 2 = 6\\n\\nAnd this is true for every 3-element subset.\\n\\nNumber of 3-element subsets: C(6,3)=20, each has F(S)=6.\\n\\nNow size 4: for each 4-element subset S, F(S) = sum over v in S such that deg_S(v) ≤2 of F(S\\\\{v})\\n\\nNow F(S\\\\{v}) is for a 3-element set, which we have as 6 for each.\\n\\nBut now deg_S(v) could be 3, since in a 4-vertex set, a vertex can have degree up to 3.\\n\\nFor example, vertex B (1) has neighbors A(0),C(2),E(4). If S contains B and all three neighbors, then deg_S(B)=3.\\n\\nSimilarly for E(4): neighbors B(1),D(3),F(5), so if all three are in S, deg=3.\\n\\nSo for a 4-element set S, a vertex v can have deg_S(v)=3 only if it is B or E and all its three neighbors are in S.\\n\\nOtherwise, deg ≤2.\\n\\nNow, F(S\\\\{v}) = 6 for each 3-element subset, as above.\\n\\nSo F(S) = sum_{v in S, deg_S(v) ≤2} 6\\n\\nThat is, 6 times the number of vertices in S with degree at most 2 in the induced subgraph on S.\\n\\nWe need to compute this for each 4-element subset.\\n\\nThere are C(6,4)=15 subsets. We can classify them based on which vertices are missing.\\n\\nCase 1: missing two vertices that are not both neighbors of B or E.\\n\\nList all 4-element subsets and compute the number of v in S with deg_S(v) ≤2.\\n\\nSince the graph is symmetric, we can group by symmetry.\\n\\nThe 2x3 grid has symmetries: horizontal reflection (swap left-right), vertical reflection (swap top-bottom), rotation, etc.\\n\\nBut to save time, note that the only vertices that can have degree 3 are B and E, and only when all their neighbors are present.\\n\\nFor a 4-element set S, if B is in S, then deg_S(B) = number of neighbors in S. B has neighbors A,C,E. So deg_S(B) = |{A,C,E} ∩ S|\\nSimilarly for E: deg_S(E) = |{B,D,F} ∩ S|\\n\\nOther vertices have max degree 2 in the whole graph, so in any subgraph, deg ≤2. So for v not B or E, always deg_S(v) ≤2.\\n\\nTherefore, in any subset S, the vertices with deg_S(v) >2 are only possibly B or E, and only if they have degree 3 in S.\\n\\nSo for F(S), the sum is over v in S with deg_S(v) ≤2, and F(S\\\\{v})=6, so F(S) = 6 * (number of v in S with deg_S(v) ≤2)\\n\\nSince there are 4 vertices in S, and at most two of them (B and E) might have deg>2, but only if deg=3.\\n\\nSpecifically:\\n- If B is in S and all three neighbors A,C,E are in S, then deg_S(B)=3, so B does not contribute.\\n- Similarly for E: if E in S and B,D,F all in S, then deg_S(E)=3.\\n\\nOtherwise, deg ≤2 for that vertex.\\n\\nNow, for a 4-element set, it's impossible for both B and E to have deg=3, because that would require at least: for B: A,C,E; for E: B,D,F; so {A,B,C,D,E,F} all six, but we have only four vertices. Contradiction.\\n\\nSo at most one of B or E can have deg=3 in a 4-vertex set.\\n\\nNow, when does B have deg=3? When B in S, and A,C,E all in S. But S has only 4 vertices, so S = {B,A,C,E}\\n\\nSimilarly, E has deg=3 when S = {E,B,D,F}\\n\\nAre there any other 4-sets where a vertex has deg=3? No, because only B and E have degree 3 in the full graph.\\n\\nSo only two 4-element subsets where some vertex has deg>2:\\n1. S1 = {A,B,C,E} = {0,1,2,4}\\n   Here, B is connected to A,C,E, all in S, so deg_S1(B)=3\\n   E is connected to B (in), D(not in), F(not in), so deg_S1(E)=1\\n   A: neighbors B(in), D(not) → deg=1\\n   C: neighbors B(in), F(not) → deg=1\\n   So only B has deg=3, others have deg≤2.\\n   So number of v with deg≤2 is 3 (A,C,E)\\n   Thus F(S1) = 6 * 3 = 18\\n\\n2. S2 = {B,D,E,F} = {1,3,4,5}\\n   E connected to B,D,F all in → deg=3\\n   B connected to A(not),C(not),E(in) → deg=1\\n   D: A(not),E(in) → deg=1\\n   F: C(not),E(in) → deg=1\\n   So only E has deg=3, others deg=1\\n   Number of v with deg≤2: 3 (B,D,F)\\n   F(S2) = 6 * 3 = 18\\n\\nFor all other 4-element subsets, no vertex has deg>2, so all 4 vertices have deg≤2, so F(S) = 6 * 4 = 24\\n\\nHow many such subsets? Total 4-element subsets: C(6,4)=15\\nMinus 2 special ones, so 13 with F(S)=24\\n\\nNow size 5: for each 5-element subset S, F(S) = sum over v in S such that deg_S(v) ≤2 of F(S\\\\{v})\\n\\nF(S\\\\{v}) is for a 4-element set, which we have computed: either 18 or 24 depending on the set.\\n\\ndeg_S(v) is the degree in the 5-vertex induced subgraph.\\n\\nIn a 5-vertex set, a vertex can have degree up to 3 (since max degree in graph is 3), but could it be more? No.\\n\\nWhen is deg_S(v) =3? For v=B: if A,C,E all in S. Since S has 5 vertices, missing one.\\n\\nSimilarly for E: if B,D,F all in S.\\n\\nNow, for a 5-element set, missing one vertex.\\n\\nCase 1: missing a vertex not incident to high degree.\\n\\nList by which vertex is missing.\\n\\nThere are 6 possibilities (missing one vertex).\\n\\n1. Missing A (0): S = {1,2,3,4,5} = B,C,D,E,F\\n   Compute degrees in S:\\n   B: neighbors A(missing),C(in),E(in) → deg=2\\n   C: B(in),F(in) → deg=2\\n   D: A(miss),E(in) → deg=1\\n   E: B(in),D(in),F(in) → deg=3\\n   F: C(in),E(in) → deg=2\\n   So E has deg=3, others deg≤2.\\n   So v with deg≤2: B,C,D,F (4 vertices)\\n   Now F(S\\\\{v}) for each such v:\\n   - Remove B: S\\\\{B} = {2,3,4,5} = C,D,E,F\\n     Is this one of the special 4-sets? Earlier S2={1,3,4,5}=B,D,E,F, but this is {2,3,4,5}, different.\\n     Check if it has a deg=3 vertex: E has neighbors B(miss),D(in),F(in) → deg=2\\n     C: B(miss),F(in) → deg=1\\n     D: E(in) → deg=1\\n     F: C(in),E(in) → deg=2\\n     All deg≤2, so F(S\\\\{B}) = 24 (since not S1 or S2)\\n   - Remove C: S\\\\{C} = {1,3,4,5} = B,D,E,F → this is S2, which has F=18\\n   - Remove D: S\\\\{D} = {1,2,4,5} = B,C,E,F\\n     Check: B: A(miss),C(in),E(in) → deg=2\\n     C: B(in),F(in) → deg=2\\n     E: B(in),D(miss),F(in) → deg=2\\n     F: C(in),E(in) → deg=2\\n     All deg≤2, so F=24\\n   - Remove F: S\\\\{F} = {1,2,3,4} = B,C,D,E\\n     B: A(miss),C(in),E(in) → deg=2\\n     C: B(in),F(miss) → deg=1\\n     D: A(miss),E(in) → deg=1\\n     E: B(in),D(in),F(miss) → deg=2\\n     All deg≤2, so F=24\\n   - Remove E: but deg_S(E)=3, so cannot remove E (since condition not satisfied), so not included.\\n   So sum over v with deg≤2: B,C,D,F\\n   F(S\\\\{B})=24, F(S\\\\{C})=18, F(S\\\\{D})=24, F(S\\\\{F})=24\\n   So F(S) = 24 + 18 + 24 + 24 = 90\\n\\n2. Missing B (1): S = {0,2,3,4,5} = A,C,D,E,F\\n   Degrees:\\n   A: B(miss),D(in) → deg=1\\n   C: B(miss),F(in) → deg=1\\n   D: A(in),E(in) → deg=2\\n   E: B(miss),D(in),F(in) → deg=2\\n   F: C(in),E(in) → deg=2\\n   All deg≤2, so all 5 vertices qualify.\\n   Now F(S\\\\{v}) for each:\\n   - Remove A: S\\\\{A} = {2,3,4,5} = C,D,E,F → as above, F=24\\n   - Remove C: S\\\\{C} = {0,3,4,5} = A,D,E,F\\n     Check: A: D(in) → deg=1\\n     D: A(in),E(in) → deg=2\\n     E: D(in),F(in) → deg=2\\n     F: E(in) → deg=1\\n     All deg≤2, so F=24\\n   - Remove D: S\\\\{D} = {0,2,4,5} = A,C,E,F\\n     A: D(miss) → deg=0? Neighbors: B(miss),D(miss)? No, A connected to B and D, both missing?

But the grid is symmetric under left-right reflection: swap A↔C, B↔B, D↔F, E↔E\\n   Missing C is like missing A, but reflected.\\n   So similar to case 1.\\n   Degrees:\\n   A: B(in),D(in) → deg=2\\n   B: A(in),C(miss),E(in) → deg=2\\n   D: A(in),E(in) → deg=2\\n   E: B(in),D(in),F(in) → deg=3\\n   F: C(miss),E(in) → deg=1\\n   So E has deg=3, others deg≤2.\\n   v with deg≤2: A,B,D,F (4 vertices)\\n   F(S\\\\{v}):\\n   - Remove A: S\\\\{A} = {1,3,4,5} = B,D,E,F → this is S2, F=18\\n   - Remove B: S\\\\{B} = {0,3,4,5} = A,D,E,F → as above in missing B case, F=24\\n   - Remove D: S\\\\{D} = {0,1,4,5} = A,B,E,F\\n     A: B(in),D(miss) → deg=1\\n     B: A(in),C(miss),E(in) → deg=2\\n     E: B(in),D(miss),F(in) → deg=2\\n     F: E(in) → deg=1\\n     All deg≤2, F=24\\n   - Remove F: S\\\\{F} = {0,1,3,4} = A,B,D,E\\n     A: B(in),D(in) → deg=2\\n     B: A(in),E(in) → deg=2\\n     D: A(in),E(in) → deg=2\\n     E: B(in),D(in) → deg=2\\n     All deg≤2, F=24\\n   So F(S) = F(S\\\\{A}) + F(S\\\\{B}) + F(S\\\\{D}) + F(S\\\\{F}) = 18 + 24 + 24 + 24 = 90\\n\\n4. Missing D (3): S = {0,1,2,4,5} = A,B,C,E,F\\n   By symmetry to missing F? Or to missing A? Vertical reflection: swap top and bottom: A↔D, B↔E, C↔F\\n   Missing D is like missing A under this reflection? Missing D: S has A,B,C,E,F\\n   Under vertical reflection: A→D, B→E, C→F, D→A, E→B, F→C\\n   So missing D becomes missing A, and S becomes {D,E,F,B,C}? Original S: {0,1,2,4,5}, after reflection: {3,4,5,1,2} = {1,2,3,4,5} which is missing A, same as case 1.\\n   So should be similar.\\n   Degrees:\\n   A: B(in),D(miss) → deg=1\\n   B: A(in),C(in),E(in) → deg=3\\n   C: B(in),F(in) → deg=2\\n   E: B(in),D(miss),F(in) → deg=2\\n   F: C(in),E(in) → deg=2\\n   So B has deg=3, others deg≤2.\\n   v with deg≤2: A,C,E,F (4 vertices)\\n   F(S\\\\{v}):\\n   - Remove A: S\\\\{A} = {1,2,4,5} = B,C,E,F → all deg≤2? B: C,E → deg=2, C: B,F → deg=2, E: B,F → deg=2, F: C,E → deg=2, so F=24\\n   - Remove C: S\\\\{C} = {0,1,4,5} = A,B,E,F → A: B → deg=1, B: A,E → deg=2, E: B,F → deg=2, F: E → deg=1, all deg≤2, F=24\\n   - Remove E: S\\\\{E} = {0,1,2,5} = A,B,C,F → A: B → deg=1, B: A,C → deg=2, C: B,F → deg=2, F: C → deg=1, all deg≤2, F=24\\n   - Remove F: S\\\\{F} = {0,1,2,4} = A,B,C,E → this is S1 = {0,1,2,4}, which has F=18\\n   So F(S) = 24 + 24 + 24 + 18 = 90\\n\\n5. Missing E (4): S = {0,1,2,3,5} = A,B,C,D,F\\n   Degrees:\\n   A: B(in),D(in) → deg=2\\n   B: A(in),C(in),E(miss) → deg=2\\n   C: B(in),F(in) → deg=2\\n   D: A(in),E(miss) → deg=1\\n   F: C(in),E(miss) → deg=1\\n   All deg≤2, so all 5 vertices qualify.\\n   F(S\\\\{v}) for each:\\n   Each S\\\\{v} is a 4-element set not containing E.\\n   Possible sets:\\n   - Remove A: {1,2,3,5} = B,C,D,F\\n     Check: B: A(miss),C(in),E(miss) → deg=1\\n     C: B(in),F(in) → deg=2\\n     D: A(miss),E(miss) → deg=0\\n     F: C(in),E(miss) → deg=1\\n     All deg≤2, so F=24\\n   Similarly, any 4-set without E and without one other, but since E is not in, and the special sets S1 and S2 both contain E, so all these 4-sets are not special, so F=24 for each.\\n   There are 5 such v, each giving F(S\\\\{v})=24, so F(S) = 5 * 24 = 120\\n\\n6. Missing F (5): S = {0,1,2,3,4} = A,B,C,D,E\\n   By symmetry to missing C or A? Vertical reflection: missing F → missing C, and S → {0,1,2,3,4} → {3,4,5,0,1}? Reflection: A→D, B→E, C→F, D→A, E→B, F→C\\n   So missing F → missing C, S={0,1,2,3,4} → {3,4,5,0,1} = {0,1,3,4,5} which is missing C, case 3, which had F=90\\n   But we need F(S), not the value.\\n   Compute directly:\\n   S = A,B,C,D,E\\n   Degrees:\\n   A: B(in),D(in) → deg=2\\n   B: A(in),C(in),E(in) → deg=3\\n   C: B(in),F(miss) → deg=1\\n   D: A(in),E(in) → deg=2\\n   E: B(in),D(in),F(miss) → deg=2\\n   So B has deg=3, others deg≤2.\\n   v with deg≤2: A,C,D,E (4 vertices)\\n   F(S\\\\{v}):\\n   - Remove A: S\\\\{A} = {1,2,3,4} = B,C,D,E → all deg≤2? B: C,E → deg=2, C: B → deg=1, D: E → deg=1, E: B,D → deg=2, so F=24\\n   - Remove C: S\\\\{C} = {0,1,3,4} = A,B,D,E → A: B,D → deg=2, B: A,E → deg=2, D: A,E → deg=2, E: B,D → deg=2, F=24\\n   - Remove D: S\\\\{D} = {0,1,2,4} = A,B,C,E → this is S1, F=18\\n   - Remove E: S\\\\{E} = {0,1,2,3} = A,B,C,D → A: B,D → deg=2, B: A,C → deg=2, C: B → deg=1, D: A → deg=1, all deg≤2, F=24\\n   So F(S) = 24 + 24 + 18 + 24 = 90\\n\\nSummary for size 5:\\n- Missing A: F=90\\n- Missing B: F=120\\n- Missing C: F=90\\n- Missing D: F=90\\n- Missing E: F=120\\n- Missing F: F=90\\n\\nNow size 6: full set S = {0,1,2,3,4,5}\\nF(S) = sum over v in S such that deg_S(v) ≤2 of F(S\\\\{v})\\n\\nFirst, deg_S(v) in the full graph:\\n- A:2, B:3, C:2, D:2, E:3, F:2\\nSo deg≤2 for A,C,D,F; deg=3 for B,E.\\nSo only A,C,D,F can be removed (eaten) first? No: this is for the last step in the reverse process, but in the elimination order, this corresponds to the first piece eaten.\\n\\nRecall: in the reverse process (adding), we add v last if when we add it, it has ≤2 neighbors already in S\\\\{v}.\\nBut in the elimination order, the first piece eaten is the one we remove first, which corresponds to the last added in reverse.\\n\\nFor F(S), it is sum over v such that |N(v) ∩ (S\\\\{v})| ≤2 of F(S\\\\{v})\\n|N(v) ∩ (S\\\\{v})| is the number of neighbors of v in the other 5 vertices, which is exactly deg_S(v), since no self-loop.\\nSo condition is deg_S(v) ≤2.\\nSo v must have degree at most 2 in the full graph.\\nThus v can be A,C,D,F (degrees 2), but not B or E (degree 3).\\n\\nSo F(full) = sum_{v in {A,C,D,F}} F(S\\\\{v})\\n\\nS\\\\{v} is the 5-element set missing v.\\n\\nFrom above:\\n- If remove A: F(S\\\\{A}) = 90\\n- Remove C: F(S\\\\{C}) = 90\\n- Remove D: F(S\\\\{D}) = 90\\n- Remove F: F(S\\\\{F}) = 90\\n\\nAll are 90? From above:\\nMissing A:90, missing C:90, missing D:90, missing F:90\\nMissing B:120, missing E:120, but we are not removing B or E.\\n\\nSo F(full) = F(missing A) + F(missing C) + F(missing D) + F(missing F) = 90 + 90 + 90 + 90 = 360\\n\\nBut F(S\\\\{v}) is the number of ways to build the 5-element set, which corresponds to the number of elimination orders for the remaining 5 pieces, but in the reverse process.\\n\\nF(S) is the number of valid addition sequences for set S.\\nEach such sequence corresponds to a permutation of the vertices in the order they are added.\\nThe elimination order (eating order) is the reverse of the addition order.\\n\\nSince we want the number of eating orders, and each addition sequence gives a unique eating order (reverse), and vice versa, so the number of valid eating orders is equal to F(full set) = 360.\\n\\nBut is that correct? F(S) counts the number of ways to add the vertices in an order where each new vertex has at most two neighbors already present.\\nEach such addition order corresponds to an elimination order (reverse) where each removed vertex has at most two neighbors remaining at the time of removal.\\nYes, exactly the condition.\\n\\nSo the number is 360.\\n\\nBut let me verify with a smaller case or intuition.\\nInitially, only A,C,D,F can be eaten (degree 2), B and E cannot (degree 3).\\nAfter eating one corner, say A, then B loses a neighbor, so B now has degree 2 (connected to C,E), so B can be eaten next, etc.\\n\\nTotal 360 seems reasonable.\\n\\nBut the pieces are distinguishable, and we have counted the number of sequences, so yes.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 1 is 360.\\n\\nProblem 2: a and b chosen uniformly from [0,1], independently. Find probability that a, b, and 1 form an obtuse triangle.\\n\\nFor three lengths to form a triangle, they must satisfy triangle inequalities:\\na + b > 1\\na + 1 > b\\nb + 1 > a\\n\\nSince a,b ≤1, a+1 > b is always true because a+1 ≥1 ≥b? Not if b=1, a=0, but a+1=1, b=1, so 1>1 false, but ≥ is required? Triangle inequality is strict for non-degenerate triangle, but usually for probability, we allow equality or not?\\n\\nTypically, for a triangle, strict inequality: sum of any two sides greater than the third.\\n\\nSo:\\n1. a + b > 1\\n2. a + 1 > b\\n3. b + 1 > a\\n\\nNow, since a ≤1, b≤1, a+1 ≥1 ≥b? 1≥b is true, but a+1 > b: since a≥0, a+1≥1, b≤1, so a+1 ≥1 ≥b, but equality when a=0,b=1, then a+1=1, b=1, so 1>1 is false. So we need a+1 > b, which since a+1 ≥1, b≤1, the critical case is when b=1, a=0, but otherwise, if b<1, even if a=0, a+1=1>b if b<1. But when b=1, a+1>1 implies a>0.\\nSimilarly, b+1>a is always true if a<1, and when a=1, requires b>0.\\n\\nBut since continuous, the probability on lines is zero, so we can ignore equality cases, but to be precise, the inequalities are:\\na + b > 1\\na + 1 > b  ⇨ a > b - 1, but b-1≤0, a≥0, so always true if b≤1, but as above, when b=1, a>0\\nSimilarly, b + 1 > a ⇨ b > a - 1, always true if a≤1, but when a=1, b>0\\n\\nBut since the set where a=0 and b=1 has measure zero, P(a+1 > b) =1, similarly P(b+1 > a)=1, because the only failures are when (a=0,b=1) or (a=1,b=0), which have probability zero.\\n\\nTherefore, the only relevant triangle inequality is a + b > 1.\\n\\nSo for a,b in [0,1]^2, the triangle exists iff a+b>1.\\n\\nNow, among such triangles, we want it to be obtuse.\\n\\nAn obtuse triangle has one angle greater than 90 degrees.\\nBy the law of cosines, the angle opposite side c is obtuse if c^2 > a^2 + b^2.\\n\\nHere, the sides are a,b,1. The largest side will be opposite the largest angle.\\n\\nSince 1 is fixed, and a,b ≤1, the largest side could be 1, or possibly a or b if they are large, but since a≤1, b≤1, the side of length 1 is at least as long as a and b, so it is the longest side.\\n\\nIs that true? a≤1, b≤1, so 1 ≥ a, 1 ≥ b, so yes, 1 is the longest side.\\n\\nTherefore, the largest angle is opposite the side of length 1.\\n\\nThis angle is obtuse if 1^2 > a^2 + b^2, i.e., a^2 + b^2 < 1.\\n\\nIt is acute if a^2 + b^2 > 1, right if equal.\\n\\nBut we also need the triangle to exist, i.e., a+b>1.\\n\\nMoreover, since 1 is the longest side, the other angles are acute, so the triangle is obtuse iff the angle opposite side 1 is obtuse, iff a^2 + b^2 < 1.\\n\\nTherefore, the conditions are:\\na + b > 1 and a^2 + b^2 < 1, with a,b in [0,1].\\n\\nWe need the probability, so area of the region in the unit square [0,1]×[0,1] where a+b>1 and a^2 + b^2 <1, divided by total area 1.\\n\\nSo compute the area of {(a,b) | 0≤a≤1, 0≤b≤1, a+b>1, a^2 + b^2 <1}\\n\\nThe unit square.\\n\\nThe line a+b=1 is the diagonal from (1,0) to (0,1).\\n\\nThe circle a^2 + b^2 =1 is the unit circle, which passes through (1,0),(0,1),(-1,0), etc., so in the first quadrant, it's the quarter circle from (1,0) to (0,1).\\n\\nThe region a+b>1 is above the line a+b=1, i.e., towards (1,1).\\n\\nThe region a^2 + b^2 <1 is inside the unit circle.\\n\\nThe point (1,1) has a^2+b^2=2>1, so outside the circle.\\n\\nThe line a+b=1 and the circle a^2+b^2=1 intersect when? Solve: from a+b=1, b=1-a, plug in: a^2 + (1-a)^2 =1 ⇒ a^2 + 1 -2a +a^2 =1 ⇒ 2a^2 -2a +1=1 ⇒ 2a^2 -2a=0 ⇒ 2a(a-1)=0 ⇒ a=0 or a=1.\\nSo they intersect at (0,1) and (1,0).\\n\\nNow, the region a+b>1 and a^2+b^2<1: since at (0.5,0.5), a+b=1, not greater, and a^2+b^2=0.5<1, but a+b=1 not >1.\\nConsider a point like (0.7,0.7): a+b=1.4>1, a^2+b^2=0.49+0.49=0.98<1, so inside.\\n(0.8,0.8): a+b=1.6>1, a^2+b^2=0.64+0.64=1.28>1, outside.\\n\\nThe curve a^2 + b^2 =1 and the line a+b=1 touch only at corners.\\n\\nThe region a+b>1 is the triangle with vertices (1,0),(1,1),(0,1), but cut by the axes.\\n\\nThe region a^2 + b^2 <1 is the disk.\\n\\nTheir intersection: since the line a+b=1 is below the circle in between, because for example at a=0.5, b=0.5, on the line, a^2+b^2=0.5<1, and the circle is above.\\n\\nFor a given a, b>1-a, and b<sqrt(1-a^2), and b≤1.\\n\\nSince sqrt(1-a^2) ≤1 for a in [0,1], and 1-a ≤1, but we need b>1-a and b<sqrt(1-a^2), so we need 1-a < sqrt(1-a^2) for there to be such b.\\n\\nSet x=a, solve 1-x < sqrt(1-x^2)\\nSince both sides positive for x in (0,1), we can square: (1-x)^2 < 1-x^2 ⇒ 1 -2x +x^2 <1 -x^2 ⇒ -2x +x^2 < -x^2 ⇒ 2x^2 -2x <0 ⇒ 2x(x-1)<0 ⇒ x(x-1)<0 ⇒ 0<x<1\\nWhich is true for all x in (0,1).\\nMoreover, at x=0, 1-0=1, sqrt(1-0)=1, so 1<1 false, but strict.\\nAt x=1, same.\\nBut for x in (0,1), 1-x < sqrt(1-x^2)? At x=0.5, 1-0.5=0.5, sqrt(1-0.25)=sqrt(0.75)≈0.866>0.5, yes.\\nAnd since the inequality is strict, and continuous, for each a in (0,1), 1-a < sqrt(1-a^2), so the interval for b is non-empty.\\n\\nAlso, b must be at least max(0,1-a), but since a<1, 1-a>0, and b>1-a>0.\\nAnd b<min(1, sqrt(1-a^2)) = sqrt(1-a^2) since it's less than 1.\\n\\nSo for each a in (0,1), b ranges from 1-a to sqrt(1-a^2), but since it's strict inequalities, but for area, boundaries have measure zero.\\n\\na from ? When does 1-a < sqrt(1-a^2)? As above, for all a in (0,1), but we also need that the lower bound is less than upper bound, which is true.\\n\\nBut at a=0, b>1-0=1, and b<sqrt(1-0)=1, so b>1 and b<1, impossible. Similarly at a=1.\\n\\nSo a must be such that 1-a < sqrt(1-a^2), which holds for a in (0,1), but we need the range where the interval is non-empty, which is when 1-a < sqrt(1-a^2), i.e., a in (0,1).\\n\\nMoreover, b must be ≤1, but sqrt(1-a^2) ≤1, so b < sqrt(1-a^2) ≤1, so b<1, but since continuous, ok.\\n\\nNow, the length of b-interval is sqrt(1-a^2) - (1-a)\\n\\nBut this is for each a, but we need to integrate over a where this is positive, which is a in (0,1).\\n\\nHowever, when a is close to 0 or 1, 1-a is close to 1, sqrt(1-a^2) close to 1, but 1-a < sqrt(1-a^2) as established.\\n\\nBut is sqrt(1-a^2) > 1-a for all a in (0,1)? Yes, as we saw.\\n\\nBut we also need b ≤1, but since sqrt(1-a^2) ≤1, and b < sqrt(1-a^2) ≤1, so b<1, but in the region, b can be up to 1, but the constraint b<sqrt(1-a^2) is tighter when a>0.\\n\\nNow, the area is ∫∫ db da over a from 0 to 1, but for each a, b from max(0,1-a) to min(1, sqrt(1-a^2)), but since 1-a >0 for a<1, and sqrt(1-a^2) <1 for a>0, and 1-a < sqrt(1-a^2) for a in (0,1), so the lower limit is 1-a, upper is sqrt(1-a^2).\\n\\nBut at a=0, lower=1, upper=1, so interval length 0.\\nSimilarly at a=1.\\n\\nSo area = ∫_{a=0}^{1} [ \\sqrt{1-a^2} - (1-a) ] da\\n\\nNow, compute this integral.\\n\\nLet I = ∫_0^1 \\sqrt{1-a^2} da - ∫_0^1 (1-a) da\\n\\nFirst, ∫_0^1 (1-a) da = [a - a^2/2]_0^1 = (1 - 1/2) - 0 = 1/2\\n\\nSecond, ∫_0^1 \\sqrt{1-a^2} da\\nThis is the area under the quarter circle x^2 + y^2 =1 in first quadrant, from x=0 to x=1.\\nWhich is (1/4) π (1)^2 = π/4\\n\\nBecause the full circle area is π, quarter is π/4.\\n\\nSo I = π/4 - 1/2\\n\\nBut is that the area? This is ∫ [upper - lower] da, which is the area between the circle and the line from a=0 to a=1.\\n\\nBut in our case, for each a, b from 1-a to sqrt(1-a^2), and since sqrt(1-a^2) > 1-a for a in (0,1), this is positive, and it represents the set where b > 1-a and b < sqrt(1-a^2), which is exactly a+b>1 and a^2+b^2<1.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo area = π/4 - 1/2\\n\\nBut is this correct? At a=0.5, b from 0.5 to sqrt(0.75)≈0.866, so length about 0.366.\\nπ/4 ≈ 0.7854, minus 0.5 = 0.2854, but this is the integral, should be positive.\\n\\nBut let me confirm the region: for example, the point (0.6,0.6): a+b=1.2>1, a^2+b^2=0.36+0.36=0.72<1, so included.\\n(0.9,0.9): a+b=1.8>1, a^2+b^2=0.81+0.81=1.62>1, not included.\\n(0.9,0.2): a+b=1.1>1, a^2+b^2=0.81+0.04=0.85<1, so should be included, but for a=0.9, b>1-0.9=0.1, b<sqrt(1-0.81)=sqrt(0.19)≈0.436, so b from 0.1 to 0.436, and 0.2 is in it, yes.\\n\\nNow, is there any part where b>1? No, since sqrt(1-a^2)≤1.\\n\\nBut in the unit square, b≤1, and our upper limit is min(1, sqrt(1-a^2)) = sqrt(1-a^2) since it's ≤1, so fine.\\n\\nNow, the area we computed is π/4 - 1/2 ≈ 0.7854 - 0.5 = 0.2854\\n\\nBut this is the area where the triangle is obtuse and exists.\\n\\nThe total probability is this area, since the sample space is area 1.\\n\\nBut is that correct? We have the condition that the triangle exists, which is a+b>1, and within that, we have the obtuse condition.\\n\\nBut in our calculation, we directly computed the area where both conditions hold, so yes, this is the probability.\\n\\nBut let me confirm: the probability is the area of the set where a+b>1 and a^2+b^2<1.\\n\\nWe could compute the area where triangle exists: a+b>1, which is the triangle above the diagonal, area 1/2.\\nThen conditional probability, but we need unconditional.\\n\\nThe problem asks for the probability that a,b,1 form an obtuse triangle, which implies that they form a triangle, so we need both existence and obtuseness.\\n\\nSo yes, P(obtuse triangle) = area where a+b>1 and a^2+b^2<1 = π/4 - 1/2\\n\\nBut is this positive? π/4 ≈ 0.785 > 0.5, yes.\\n\\nNumerically, about 0.2854.\\n\\nWe can write as (π - 2)/4\\n\\nπ/4 - 1/2 = π/4 - 2/4 = (π - 2)/4\\n\\nNow, is this correct? I recall that sometimes people forget that 1 must be the longest side, but in this case, since a≤1, b≤1, yes, 1 is always the longest side, so the obtuse angle must be opposite it.\\n\\nBut what if a or b is greater than 1? But no, a and b are in [0,1], so 1 is at least as long as a and b, so it is the longest side. Equality when a=1 or b=1, but then if a=1, b<1, then sides 1,b,1, so longest sides are both 1, but still, the angle opposite the side of length 1 could be obtuse, but since there are two sides of length 1, but in any case, the largest side is 1, and if a=1, b<1, then a^2 + b^2 =1 + b^2 >1, so 1^2 =1 < 1 + b^2, so the angle opposite side 1 is acute, so not obtuse. Similarly.\\n\\nSo no issue.\\n\\nAnother way to think: the triangle is obtuse iff the sum of squares of two sides is less than square of the third, but since 1 is largest, only possible if a^2 + b^2 < 1^2.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo probability is (π - 2)/4\\n\\nBut let me confirm the integral.\\nArea = ∫_{a=0}^1 ∫_{b=1-a}^{\\sqrt{1-a^2}} db da = ∫_{0}^{1} \\left( \\sqrt{1-a^2} - (1-a) \\right) da\\n= ∫_0^1 \\sqrt{1-a^2} da - ∫_0^1 (1-a) da = \\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\pi - 2}{4}\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 2 is (π - 2)/4\\n\\nNow, back to Problem 1, we got 360.\\n\\nBut is this correct? Let me see if it makes sense.\\nTotal possible orders without constraint: 6! = 720\\nWith constraint, we got 360, half, which might be reasonable.\\n\\nAnother way: the only restriction is that B and E cannot be eaten first, since they have degree 3.\\nAfter that, it opens up.\\n\\nBut anyway, our DP seems correct.\\n\\nSo final answers:\\nProblem 1: 360\\nProblem 2: (π - 2)/4\\n\\nIn the JSON, we need to put the answers as strings, exact values.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"360\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(π - 2)/4\"\n}",
