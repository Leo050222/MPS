  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\n\\nWe are given that Michael and Kylo each independently choose a positive integer ≤ N uniformly at random. Let the two numbers be X and Y. We want the probability that the units digit of X×Y is 0, i.e., X×Y ≡ 0 (mod 10). This means X×Y must be divisible by 10, so it must be divisible by both 2 and 5.\\n\\nLet p_N = P(XY ≡ 0 mod 10).\\n\\nSince X and Y are chosen independently and uniformly from {1,2,…,N}, we can write:\\n\\np_N = P(10 divides XY) = P(2|XY and 5|XY)\\n\\nWe aim to find the maximum value of p_N over all positive integers N, and express it as a reduced fraction a/b, then compute 100a + b.\\n\\nStep 1: Understand when XY is divisible by 10\\n\\nFor XY to be divisible by 10, it must be divisible by 2 and by 5. So either:\\n- X contributes the factor 2 and Y contributes 5,\\n- or vice versa,\\n- or one number contributes both 2 and 5 (i.e., is divisible by 10),\\n- or both contribute some combination.\\n\\nBut more systematically, we can use complementary probability:\\n\\np_N = 1 − P(XY not divisible by 2 or not divisible by 5)\\n      = 1 − [P(XY not divisible by 2) + P(XY not divisible by 5) − P(XY not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 5)]\\n\\nBut actually, better to compute directly:\\n\\nP(XY ≡ 0 mod 10) = 1 − P(XY not divisible by 2 or not divisible by 5)\\nBut inclusion-exclusion might get messy. Instead, think:\\n\\nP(XY divisible by 10) = 1 − P(XY not divisible by 2) − P(XY divisible by 2 but not by 5) − P(XY divisible by 5 but not by 2)? No, too many cases.\\n\\nBetter approach: Use the fact that for large N, the distribution modulo 10 stabilizes. But since we want the maximum possible p_N, perhaps the maximum occurs when N is a multiple of 10, so that the distribution modulo 10 is uniform.\\n\\nLet’s suppose N is a multiple of 10, say N = 10k. Then the numbers 1 to N contain exactly k numbers congruent to each residue mod 10.\\n\\nThen X and Y are uniformly distributed over residues mod 10.\\n\\nSo we can compute the probability over Z_10 × Z_10.\\n\\nTotal pairs: 100.\\nCount how many pairs (x,y) ∈ {1,...,10}^2 such that xy ≡ 0 mod 10.\\n\\nBut note: the numbers are from 1 to 10, not 0 to 9. So residues: 1,2,...,10 (where 10 ≡ 0 mod 10).\\n\\nSo include 10 as a possible choice (which is 0 mod 10).\\n\\nBut in modular arithmetic, if x ≡ 0 mod 10, then xy ≡ 0 mod 10 regardless of y.\\nSimilarly if y ≡ 0 mod 10.\\nAlso, even if neither is 0 mod 10, their product could still be 0 mod 10, e.g., x=2, y=5 → 10.\\n\\nSo let’s list all ordered pairs (x,y) with x,y ∈ {1,2,...,10} such that xy ≡ 0 mod 10.\\n\\nFirst, count total: 100.\\nNow count favorable.\\n\\nCase 1: x ≡ 0 mod 10 → x=10. Then any y works → 10 values.\\nCase 2: y ≡ 0 mod 10 → y=10. Then any x works → 10 values.\\nBut (10,10) is counted twice, so total so far: 10 + 10 − 1 = 19.\\nBut this only counts when x or y is divisible by 10. But there are other cases where neither is divisible by 10, but product is.\\nFor example, x=2, y=5 → 10; x=4, y=5 → 20; x=6, y=5 → 30; x=8, y=5 → 40; x=5, y=2 → 10; etc.\\nSo we need to include cases where x provides factor 2, y provides 5, or vice versa, but not necessarily full 10.\\n\\nBetter: xy ≡ 0 mod 10 iff 2|xy and 5|xy.\\nSo:\\n- Either 2|x or 2|y (but at least one)\\n- Either 5|x or 5|y (but at least one)\\nBut no: we need both conditions simultaneously.\\nActually: we need 2|xy AND 5|xy.\\nWhich is equivalent to: (2|x or 2|y) is always true? No, not necessarily.\\nActually: 2|xy iff 2|x or 2|y? No: if both odd, xy odd. So 2|xy iff at least one of x,y even.\\nSimilarly, 5|xy iff at least one of x,y divisible by 5.\\nTherefore:\\n\\nP(XY divisible by 10) = P(at least one even AND at least one divisible by 5)\\n\\nThis is key!\\n\\nBecause 2 and 5 are prime.\\n\\nSo define:\\nA = event that at least one of X,Y is even\\nB = event that at least one of X,Y is divisible by 5\\nThen we want P(A ∩ B) = 1 − P(A^c ∪ B^c) = 1 − [P(A^c) + P(B^c) − P(A^c ∩ B^c)]\\n\\nWhere:\\nA^c: both X and Y are odd\\nB^c: neither X nor Y is divisible by 5\\nA^c ∩ B^c: both odd and neither divisible by 5\\n\\nSo:\\np_N = 1 − P(both odd) − P(neither divisible by 5) + P(both odd and neither divisible by 5)\\n\\nNow, if N is large and multiple of 10, we can compute exact fractions.\\nAssume N = 10k.\\n\\nThen:\\n- Number of even numbers ≤ N: 5k (since every other number)\\n- Odd: 5k\\n- Divisible by 5: floor(N/5) = 2k\\n- Not divisible by 5: N − 2k = 8k\\n\\nBut we need probabilities:\\nP(X even) = 5k / 10k = 1/2 → P(X odd) = 1/2\\nSimilarly for Y.\\nSo P(both odd) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\\n\\nP(X not divisible by 5) = 8k / 10k = 4/5 → P(neither divisible by 5) = (4/5)^2 = 16/25\\n\\nNow P(both odd and neither divisible by 5):\\nNeed to count numbers that are odd and not divisible by 5.\\nIn 1 to 10: odd numbers: 1,3,5,7,9\\nAmong these, not divisible by 5: 1,3,7,9 → 4 out of 10\\nSo proportion: 4/10 = 2/5\\nSimilarly, in 1 to 10k, number of such numbers: 4k\\nSo P(X odd and not div by 5) = 4k / 10k = 2/5\\nThus P(both odd and neither div by 5) = (2/5)^2 = 4/25\\n\\nTherefore:\\np_N = 1 − 1/4 − 16/25 + 4/25\\nCompute:\\n1 − 0.25 = 0.75\\n16/25 = 0.64, 4/25 = 0.16\\nSo 0.75 − 0.64 + 0.16? No:\\nIt's 1 − 1/4 − 16/25 + 4/25 = (1 − 1/4) + (−16/25 + 4/25) = 3/4 − 12/25\\nCompute: 3/4 = 75/100, 12/25 = 48/100 → 75/100 − 48/100 = 27/100? No:\\nWait: 3/4 − 12/25 = (75 − 48)/100 = 27/100? But that's less than 0.3, but earlier terms suggest higher.\\nWait no: p_N = 1 − P(A^c) − P(B^c) + P(A^c ∩ B^c) = 1 − 1/4 − 16/25 + 4/25\\nSo: 1 − 0.25 = 0.75\\nThen −16/25 = −0.64 → 0.75 − 0.64 = 0.11\\nThen +0.16 → 0.27\\nYes, 27/100.\\nBut is this correct? 27/100 = 0.27\\nBut let's verify by direct count for N=10.\\n\\nWhen N=10, total pairs: 100.\\nCount number of (x,y) such that xy has units digit 0, i.e., xy ≡ 0 mod 10.\\n\\nList x from 1 to 10, for each x, find y such that xy ≡ 0 mod 10.\\n\\nx=1: need y ≡ 0 mod 10 → y=10 → 1 value\\nx=2: need 2y ≡ 0 mod 10 → y ≡ 0 mod 5 → y=5,10 → 2 values\\nx=3: 3y≡0 mod 10 → y≡0 mod 10? 3y divisible by 10 → y must be divisible by 10/gcd(3,10)=10 → y=10 → 1 value\\nx=4: 4y≡0 mod 10 → 2y≡0 mod 5 → y≡0 mod 5/ gcd(2,5)=5 → y≡0 mod 5 → y=5,10 → 2 values\\nx=5: 5y≡0 mod 10 → y even → y=2,4,6,8,10 → 5 values\\nx=6: 6y≡0 mod 10 → 3y≡0 mod 5 → y≡0 mod 5 → y=5,10 → 2 values\\nx=7: 7y≡0 mod 10 → y≡0 mod 10 → y=10 → 1 value\\nx=8: 8y≡0 mod 10 → 4y≡0 mod 5 → y≡0 mod 5 → y=5,10 → 2 values\\nx=9: 9y≡0 mod 10 → y≡0 mod 10 → y=10 → 1 value\\nx=10: 10y≡0 mod 10 → any y → 10 values\\n\\nNow sum: x=1:1, x=2:2, x=3:1, x=4:2, x=5:5, x=6:2, x=7:1, x=8:2, x=9:1, x=10:10\\nSum: 1+2=3; +1=4; +2=6; +5=11; +2=13; +1=14; +2=16; +1=17; +10=27.\\nTotal 27 favorable pairs.\\nTotal 100 → p_10 = 27/100.\\nMatches our calculation.\\n\\nBut is this the maximum? The problem asks for the maximum possible p_N over all N.\\n\\nPerhaps for other N, p_N is larger.\\nTry N=5.\\nNumbers: 1,2,3,4,5\\nTotal pairs: 25\\nNow compute favorable: xy ≡0 mod 10.\\nBut maximum product is 25, so only possible if xy=10,20\\nxy=10: (2,5),(5,2)\\nxy=20: (4,5),(5,4)\\nIs that all?\\n(5,2)=10, (5,4)=20, (2,5)=10, (4,5)=20\\nWhat about (5,5)=25, not divisible by 2, so no.\\nSo only 4 pairs.\\nBut check: x=5, y must be even: y=2,4 → (5,2),(5,4)\\nx=2, y must make 2y≡0 mod 10 → y≡0 mod 5 → y=5 → (2,5)\\nx=4, similarly y=5 → (4,5)\\nx=1,3: only if y= something, but 1y=y, need y≡0 mod 10, none\\nx=3: same\\nx=5: already did\\nSo only 4 pairs: (2,5),(4,5),(5,2),(5,4)\\nSo p_5 = 4/25 = 16/100 = 0.16 < 0.27\\n\\nN=6: numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6\\nTotal pairs: 36\\nFavorable: xy≡0 mod 10\\nPossible products: 10,20,30\\nPairs: (2,5)=10, (5,2)=10, (4,5)=20, (5,4)=20, (5,6)=30, (6,5)=30, (6, something)? 6y≡0 mod 10 → 3y≡0 mod 5 → y≡0 mod 5 → y=5 → (6,5)\\nSimilarly (2,5),(4,5) already\\nx=5: y even: y=2,4,6 → (5,2),(5,4),(5,6)\\nx=6: y≡0 mod 5 → y=5 → (6,5)\\nx=2: y≡0 mod 5 → y=5 → (2,5)\\nx=4: y=5 → (4,5)\\nx=1,3: no\\nSo list: (2,5),(4,5),(5,2),(5,4),(5,6),(6,5) → 6 pairs\\nIs that all? (6,5)=30, yes.\\nBut (5,5)=25, not divisible by 2, so no.\\nSo 6 favorable.\\np_6 = 6/36 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667 < 0.27\\n\\nN=4: max product 16, possible xy=10\\n(2,5) but 5>4, not available. Similarly no 5. So no pair can have product divisible by 5, so p_4=0\\n\\nN=5 we had 4/25=0.16\\nN=10: 27/100=0.27\\n\\nTry N=15.\\nN=15, not multiple of 10.\\nNumbers 1 to 15.\\nWe need P(XY divisible by 10) = P(at least one even and at least one divisible by 5)\\nUse formula:\\np_N = 1 − P(both odd) − P(neither div by 5) + P(both odd and neither div by 5)\\n\\nFirst, total numbers: 15\\nEven: 2,4,6,8,10,12,14 → 7\\nOdd: 8\\nDiv by 5: 5,10,15 → 3\\nNot div by 5: 12\\n\\nP(X odd) = 8/15 → P(both odd) = (8/15)^2 = 64/225\\nP(X not div by 5) = 12/15 = 4/5 → P(neither) = (4/5)^2 = 16/25\\nBut 16/25 = 144/225? Better common denominator.\\nUse 225.\\nP(neither div by 5) = (12/15)^2 = (4/5)^2 = 16/25 = (16×9)/(25×9) = 144/225\\nP(both odd) = (8/15)^2 = 64/225\\nNow P(both odd and neither div by 5): need to count numbers that are odd and not div by 5.\\nOdd numbers: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15\\nAmong these, div by 5: 5,15 → so not div by 5: 1,3,7,9,11,13 → 6 numbers\\nSo P(X odd and not div by 5) = 6/15 = 2/5\\nThus P(both) = (2/5)^2 = 4/25 = 36/225? 4/25 = 36/225? 4/25 = (4×9)/(25×9) = 36/225 yes.\\nSo p_N = 1 − 64/225 − 144/225 + 36/225 = 1 + (−64 −144 + 36)/225 = 1 − 172/225 = (225 − 172)/225 = 53/225\\nCompute: 53/225 ≈ ? 225÷4=56.25, 53<56.25, so <0.25? 53÷225: 225×0.2=45, 53−45=8, so 0.2 + 8/225≈0.2+0.0355=0.2355 < 0.27\\nSo less than 27/100=0.27\\n\\nTry N=20.\\nN=20, multiple of 10.\\nThen similar to N=10, but scaled.\\nProportions should be same as N=10, since uniform over residues.\\nNumber of even: 10\\nOdd: 10\\nDiv by 5: 4 (5,10,15,20)\\nNot div by 5: 16\\nP(both odd) = (10/20)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\\nP(neither div by 5) = (16/20)^2 = (4/5)^2 = 16/25\\nNumbers odd and not div by 5: odd: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19\\nNot div by 5: exclude 5,15 → so 8 numbers\\nP(X odd and not div by 5) = 8/20 = 2/5\\nP(both) = (2/5)^2 = 4/25\\nSo p_N = 1 − 1/4 − 16/25 + 4/25 = same as before: 1 − 0.25 − 0.64 + 0.16 = 0.27 = 27/100\\nSame as N=10.\\n\\nBut is there an N where it's higher?\\nTry N=5: we had 4/25=16/100=0.16\\nN=15: 53/225≈0.2355\\nN=25?\\nN=25.\\nTotal: 25\\nEven: 12 (2,4,...,24)\\nOdd: 13\\nDiv by 5: 5,10,15,20,25 → 5\\nNot div by 5: 20\\nP(both odd) = (13/25)^2 = 169/625\\nP(neither div by 5) = (20/25)^2 = (4/5)^2 = 16/25 = 400/625\\nP(both odd and neither div by 5): count odd not div by 5.\\nOdd numbers: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25 → 13\\nDiv by 5: 5,15,25 → 3\\nSo not div by 5: 10\\nP(X) = 10/25 = 2/5\\nP(both) = (2/5)^2 = 4/25 = 100/625\\nSo p_N = 1 − 169/625 − 400/625 + 100/625 = (625 − 169 − 400 + 100)/625 = (625 − 569 + 100)? 625 − 169 = 456; 456 − 400 = 56; 56 + 100 = 156? No:\\n1 − A − B + C = (625/625) − 169/625 − 400/625 + 100/625 = (625 − 169 − 400 + 100)/625\\nCompute numerator: 625 − 169 = 456\\n456 − 400 = 56\\n56 + 100 = 156\\nSo 156/625\\n156 ÷ 625 = ? 625×0.25=156.25, so 156/625 = 0.2496 < 0.27\\nStill less.\\n\\nTry N=9.\\nN=9, no multiple of 10, but has 5.\\nNumbers 1 to 9.\\nEven: 2,4,6,8 → 4\\nOdd: 5\\nDiv by 5: 5 → 1\\nNot div by 5: 8\\nP(both odd) = (5/9)^2 = 25/81\\nP(neither div by 5) = (8/9)^2 = 64/81\\nP(both odd and neither div by 5): odd not div by 5: odd:1,3,5,7,9; not div by 5:1,3,7,9 → 4\\nP(X) = 4/9\\nP(both) = 16/81\\np_N = 1 − 25/81 − 64/81 + 16/81 = (81 − 25 − 64 + 16)/81 = (81 − 89 + 16)? 81 − 25 = 56; 56 − 64 = -8; -8 + 16 = 8\\nSo 8/81 ≈ 0.0988 < 0.27\\n\\nTry N=11.\\nEven: 5 (2,4,6,8,10)\\nOdd: 6\\nDiv by 5: 5,10 → 2\\nNot div by 5: 9\\nP(both odd) = (6/11)^2 = 36/121\\nP(neither) = (9/11)^2 = 81/121\\nOdd not div by 5: odd:1,3,5,7,9,11; div by 5:5 → so not:1,3,7,9,11 → 5\\nP(X) = 5/11\\nP(both) = 25/121\\np_N = 1 − 36/121 − 81/121 + 25/121 = (121 − 36 − 81 + 25)/121 = (121 − 117 + 25)? 121 − 36 = 85; 85 − 81 = 4; 4 + 25 = 29\\nSo 29/121 ≈ ? 121×0.24=29.04, so ≈0.2397 < 0.27\\n\\nTry N=12.\\nEven:6, odd:6\\nDiv by 5:5,10 →2\\nNot:10\\nP(both odd)=(6/12)^2=(1/2)^2=1/4\\nP(neither)=(10/12)^2=(5/6)^2=25/36\\nOdd not div by 5: odd:1,3,5,7,9,11; not div by 5:1,3,7,9,11 →5\\nP(X)=5/12\\nP(both)=(5/12)^2=25/144\\nNow p_N=1 − 1/4 − 25/36 + 25/144\\nCommon denominator: 144\\n1 = 144/144\\n1/4 = 36/144\\n25/36 = (25×4)/144 = 100/144\\n25/144 = 25/144\\nSo p_N = 144/144 − 36/144 − 100/144 + 25/144 = (144 − 36 − 100 + 25)/144 = (144 − 136 + 25)? 144 − 36 = 108; 108 − 100 = 8; 8 + 25 = 33\\nSo 33/144 = 11/48 ≈ 0.2292 < 0.27\\n\\nNow, what if N=5?

No, for large N, approaches 1/2.\\nIn fact, proportion of evens is floor(N/2)/N → 1/2\\nProportion of multiples of 5 is floor(N/5)/N → 1/5\\nBut in our case, for N multiple of 10, we have exactly 1/2 even, 1/5 div by 5? 2/10=1/5, yes.\\nProportion of numbers that are odd and not div by 5: as computed, 4/10=2/5? No, 4 out of 10, so 0.4, but earlier we said 2/5=0.4, yes.\\nBut 2/5 is the proportion, but in probability, it's used squared.\\nNow, suppose N is such that there are fewer odds, but if N even, number of evens is N/2, odds N/2, same.\\nIf N odd, odds = (N+1)/2, evens = (N-1)/2, so more odds, which might decrease p_N since P_both_odd increases.\\nSimilarly, for multiples of 5, if N not multiple of 5, proportion less than 1/5.\\nSo probably best when N multiple of 10, giving balanced proportions.\\nAnd since in all other cases we tried, it's less, likely 27/100 is the maximum.\\nMoreover, as N→∞, if N multiple of 10, p_N=27/100, otherwise fluctuates but seems less.\\nSo assume max is 27/100.\\na/b = 27/100, a=27,b=100, relatively prime.\\nThen 100a + b = 100*27 + 100 = 2700 + 100 = 2800.\\nBut 100a + b = 100*27 + 100? b is 100, so 2700 + 100 = 2800.\\nBut is that correct? 100a + b = 100*27 + 100 = 2800, but b is the denominator, yes.\\nBut let me confirm: a=27, b=100, gcd(27,100)=1, yes.\\n100a + b = 2700 + 100 = 2800.\\n\\nBut earlier I thought maybe higher, but couldn't find.\\nAnother way: the maximum occurs when the distribution is uniform mod 10, and we computed 27/100, and since for other N it might be less due to boundary effects, likely 27/100 is indeed the maximum.\\nSo answer for Problem 1: 2800.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nFor how many ordered triplets (a,b,c) of positive integers less than 10 is the product a×b×c divisible by 20?\\n\\nPositive integers less than 10: so a,b,c ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}\\nTotal possible triplets: 9^3 = 729\\nWe want number where abc divisible by 20.\\n20 = 2^2 * 5\\nSo abc must be divisible by 4 and by 5. (since 4 and 5 coprime)\\nSo need abc ≡ 0 mod 4 and abc ≡ 0 mod 5.\\n\\nSince 4 and 5 coprime, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, equivalent to abc ≡ 0 mod 20.\\nBut easier to handle separately.\\nWe can use inclusion or complementary counting.\\nLet S be the set of all ordered triplets: |S| = 9^3 = 729\\nLet A be the set where abc not divisible by 4\\nB be the set where abc not divisible by 5\\nWe want |S| − |A ∪ B| = |S| − (|A| + |B| − |A ∩ B|)\\nSo need |A|, |B|, |A ∩ B|\\n\\nFirst, |B|: abc not divisible by 5.\\nabc not div by 5 iff none of a,b,c is divisible by 5.\\nBecause if any one is div by 5, then product is.\\nConversely, if none is div by 5, then product not div by 5.\\nNumbers divisible by 5 in 1-9: 5 only. (10 is not included)\\nSo numbers not div by 5: 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 → 8 numbers\\nSo |B| = number of triplets where no a,b,c is 5, i.e., each chosen from the 8, so 8^3 = 512\\n\\nNow |A|: abc not divisible by 4.\\nThis is trickier, because divisibility by 4 depends on the entire product, not just individual factors.\\nA number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4, but for the product, we need the product to be divisible by 4=2^2.\\nSo we need the sum of the exponents of 2 in the prime factorizations of a,b,c to be at least 2.\\nSo better to consider the highest power of 2 dividing each number.\\nList the numbers 1 to 9 and their v_2 (2-adic valuation):\\n1: v_2=0\\n2: v_2=1\\n3: v_2=0\\n4: v_2=2 (since 4=2^2)\\n5: v_2=0\\n6: v_2=1 (6=2*3)\\n7: v_2=0\\n8: v_2=3 (8=2^3)\\n9: v_2=0\\n\\nSo the valuations:\\n- v_2=0: 1,3,5,7,9 → 5 numbers\\n- v_2=1: 2,6 → 2 numbers\\n- v_2=2: 4 → 1 number\\n- v_2=3: 8 → 1 number\\n\\nNow, abc not divisible by 4 iff v_2(abc) < 2, i.e., v_2(a)+v_2(b)+v_2(c) ≤ 1\\nSo sum of valuations ≤ 1.\\nCases:\\n1. Sum = 0: all three have v_2=0\\n2. Sum = 1: exactly one has v_2≥1, and that one has v_2=1 (since if v_2≥2, sum≥2), and the other two have v_2=0.\\n\\nCase 1: all v_2=0. Number of choices: 5 per position, so 5^3 = 125\\n\\nCase 2: exactly one has v_2=1, others v_2=0.\\nFirst, choose which one has v_2=1: 3 choices (a,b, or c)\\nThat one must be from {2,6}, so 2 choices\\nThe other two must be from v_2=0 group: {1,3,5,7,9}, 5 choices each\\nSo for each position, 3 * 2 * 5 * 5 = 3*2*25=150\\n\\nTotal |A| = case1 + case2 = 125 + 150 = 275\\n\\nNow |A ∩ B|: abc not divisible by 4 and not divisible by 5.\\nSo v_2(sum) ≤1 and none of a,b,c is divisible by 5.\\nBut not divisible by 5 means none is 5.\\nNow, in the sets above, we need to exclude 5.\\nSo redefine the groups without 5.\\nNumbers: 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 (exclude 5)\\nNow v_2:\\n1:0\\n2:1\\n3:0\\n4:2\\n6:1\\n7:0\\n8:3\\n9:0\\nSo:\\n- v_2=0: 1,3,7,9 → 4 numbers (since 5 excluded)\\n- v_2=1: 2,6 → 2 numbers\\n- v_2=2: 4 →1\\n- v_2=3: 8 →1\\n\\nNow, sum v_2 ≤1, and no 5, but since we excluded 5, all are not div by 5.\\nSo same as before, but with v_2=0 group having 4 elements.\\n\\nCase 1: all v_2=0: each from {1,3,7,9}, so 4^3 = 64\\n\\nCase 2: exactly one has v_2=1, others v_2=0.\\nChoose which one: 3 choices\\nThat one: from {2,6}, 2 choices\\nEach of the other two: from {1,3,7,9}, 4 choices\\nSo 3 * 2 * 4 * 4 = 3*2*16=96\\n\\nTotal |A ∩ B| = 64 + 96 = 160\\n\\nNow, back to inclusion-exclusion:\\n|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| − |A ∩ B| = 275 + 512 − 160 = 787 − 160 = 627? 275+512=787, minus 160=627\\n\\nThen number where abc divisible by 20 is |S| − |A ∪ B| = 729 − 627 = 102\\n\\nIs that right? 729 − 627 = 102, yes.\\n\\nBut let me verify.\\nWe can compute directly the number where abc divisible by 4 and by 5.\\nSince must be divisible by 5, at least one of a,b,c is 5.\\nAnd must be divisible by 4, i.e., v_2(sum) ≥2.\\n\\nSo cases based on how many 5s, but since 5 has v_2=0, it doesn't affect the 2-valuation.\\nSo we can condition on the positions.\\nLet T be the set where at least one is 5, and v_2(a)+v_2(b)+v_2(c) ≥2.\\n\\nTotal with at least one 5: total triplets minus no 5: 729 − 512 = 217\\nBut among these, some may not satisfy the 4-divisibility.\\nSo we need to subtract those with at least one 5 but v_2(sum) <2, i.e., ≤1.\\nBut that is exactly |A ∩ B|? No.\\n|A ∩ B| is not div by 4 and not div by 5, but we want not div by 4 but div by 5? \\nDefine C: abc divisible by 5 but not by 4.\\nThen the number we want is (number divisible by 5) minus (number divisible by 5 but not by 4)\\nNumber divisible by 5: since must have at least one 5, and total with at least one 5 is 9^3 − 8^3 = 729 − 512 = 217\\nNow, among these, how many are not divisible by 4, i.e., v_2(sum) ≤1.\\nSo we need the number of triplets with at least one 5 and v_2(a)+v_2(b)+v_2(c) ≤1.\\nThis is similar to |A ∩ B| but |A ∩ B| was not div by 5 and not div by 4, which is different.\\nHere we want div by 5 and not div by 4.\\nSo let D be the set where abc divisible by 5 but not by 4.\\nThen |D| = number with at least one 5 and sum v_2 ≤1.\\nTo compute this, we can use inclusion or cases.\\nSince the condition involves both the presence of 5 and the valuations.\\nWe can consider the positions where 5 appears.\\nBut it might be messy because of overlaps.\\nNote that if a number is 5, it has v_2=0, so it doesn't contribute to the sum.\\nSo the sum v_2 depends only on the non-5 entries.\\nBut since there might be multiple 5s, we need to consider.\\nLet k be the number of 5s in the triplet. k≥1.\\nFor each k, we can compute.\\nBut k can be 1,2,3.\\n\\nCase k=1: exactly one 5.\\nChoose which position has the 5: 3 choices.\\nThat position is fixed to 5.\\nThe other two positions are not 5, and we need the sum of their v_2 ≤1, and also they are from {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9}, but not 5, which is already satisfied.\\nNow, for the two non-5 positions, we need v_2(x) + v_2(y) ≤1.\\nEach can be from the 8 numbers: 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9\\nWith v_2 as before: v_2=0:1,3,7,9 →4\\nv_2=1:2,6 →2\\nv_2=2:4 →1\\nv_2=3:8 →1\\nTotal 8.\\nNow, sum v_2(x)+v_2(y) ≤1.\\nPossibilities:\\n- both v_2=0: 4 choices each, so 4*4=16\\n- one v_2=0, other v_2=1: choose which has v_2=1: 2 choices, that one:2 choices (2 or 6), the other:4 choices → 2*2*4=16?

Sum v_2 = v_2 of that one number, since others have v_2=0.\\nWe need sum ≤1, so v_2 of the non-5 number ≤1.\\nSo it must not have v_2≥2, i.e., not 4 or 8.\\nNumbers not 5 and v_2≤1: from {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9}, exclude 5, and v_2≤1: so v_2=0 or 1: 1,2,3,6,7,9 → and 4 has v_2=2, 8 has v_2=3, so exclude them.\\nv_2=0:1,3,7,9 →4\\nv_2=1:2,6 →2\\nTotal 6 numbers.\\nTotal non-5:8, so 6 satisfy v_2≤1.\\nSo for the single non-5 position, 6 choices.\\nSo for each choice of positions for the two 5s, 6 choices for the other.\\nSo 3 * 6 = 18\\n\\nCase k=3: all three are 5.\\nThen sum v_2 = 0+0+0=0 ≤1, so satisfies not div by 4.\\nAnd it has 5s, so div by 5.\\nOnly one such triplet: (5,5,5)\\n\\nSo total |D| = number with at least one 5 and not div by 4 = case k=1:96 + k=2:18 + k=3:1 = 96+18=114, +1=115\\n\\nBut earlier we have total with at least one 5: 217\\nThen number with at least one 5 and div by 4 should be 217 − 115 = 102\\nSame as before.\\nGood.\\n\\nSo the number is 102.\\n\\nBut is that correct? In our first method, we got 729 − 627 = 102, and now 217 − 115 = 102, consistent.\\n\\nBut let me confirm with a small check.\\nFor example, if a=b=c=5, product=125, not div by 4? 125 div 4 = 31.25, not integer, so not div by 4, so not by 20, so correctly excluded.\\nIf a=5,b=5,c=2, product=50, 50 div 20=2.5, not integer? 20*2=40, 20*3=60, so no, 50 not div by 20. Why? Because 50 div by 2 and 5, but 50/2=25, not even, so not div by 4? 50 div 4 = 12.5, not integer, so not div by 4, hence not by 20. Correct.\\nNow, when is it div by 20? For example, a=5,b=4,c=1, product=20, yes.\\nOr a=5,b=2,c=2, product=20, yes.\\nNow, in our calculation, for k=1, we had 96, but that was for not div by 4, but we need div by 4.\\nAnyway, total is 102.\\n\\nBut the problem asks for ordered triplets, and we considered ordered, so should be fine.\\n\\nSo answer for Problem 2 is 102.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: 100a + b = 100*27 + 100 = 2700 + 100 = 2800\\nProblem 2: 102\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2800\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"102\"\n}",
