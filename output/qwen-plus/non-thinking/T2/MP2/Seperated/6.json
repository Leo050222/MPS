That means the value of $ n $ must satisfy this equation such that the resulting reduced fraction $ \\\\frac{p}{q} $ leads to a consistent $ n $.\\n\\nSo let's solve:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\frac{n}{2} - 80}{n + 80} = \\\\frac{p}{q}\\n$$\\nBut we are told $ n $ is the answer — and we are to compute $ 100p + q $.\\n\\nWait — the twist is: $ n $ is defined as the answer to this problem. But what is \\\"this problem\\\"? The entire problem is asking for $ 100p + q $. So does that mean $ n = 100p + q $? Yes — because it says \\\"Let $ n $ be the answer to this problem.\\\" And the answer to Problem 1 is $ 100p + q $. So:\\n$$\\nn = 100p + q\\n$$\\nWe now solve using this.\\n\\nLet’s denote:\\n- Initial: $ A = \\\\frac{n}{2}, B = n $\\n- After transfer:\\n  - $ A' = \\\\frac{n}{2} - 80 $\\n  - $ B' = n + 80 $\\n- Ratio:\\n  $$\\n  \\\\frac{A'}{B'} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{n}{2} - 80}{n + 80} = \\\\frac{p}{q}\\n  $$\\nAnd $ n = 100p + q $, with $ \\\\gcd(p, q) = 1 $.\\n\\nLet’s write:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\frac{n}{2} - 80}{n + 80} = \\\\frac{p}{q}\\n\\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{n - 160}{2(n + 80)} = \\\\frac{p}{q}\\n$$\\nCross-multiplying:\\n$$\\nq(n - 160) = 2p(n + 80)\\n$$\\nNow substitute $ n = 100p + q $:\\n\\nLeft: $ q((100p + q) - 160) = q(100p + q - 160) $\\nRight: $ 2p((100p + q) + 80) = 2p(100p + q + 80) $\\n\\nSo:\\n$$\\nq(100p + q - 160) = 2p(100p + q + 80)\\n$$\\nExpand both sides:\\nLeft:\\n$ 100pq + q^2 - 160q $\\n\\nRight:\\n$ 200p^2 + 2pq + 160p $\\n\\nSet equal:\\n$$\\n100pq + q^2 - 160q = 200p^2 + 2pq + 160p\\n$$\\nBring all to left:\\n$$\\n100pq + q^2 - 160q - 200p^2 - 2pq - 160p = 0\\n\\\\Rightarrow (100pq - 2pq) + q^2 - 200p^2 - 160q - 160p = 0\\n\\\\Rightarrow 98pq + q^2 - 200p^2 - 160q - 160p = 0\\n$$\\nThis is messy, but perhaps try small integer values for $ p $ and $ q $, or assume small ratios.\\n\\nAlternatively, go back.

In a trapezoid, usually one pair of parallel sides.\\nWith two right angles, likely the two right angles are adjacent, so it's a right trapezoid.\\nAssume the two legs include the right angles.\\nPossible configuration: let’s say vertices A,B,C,D, with AB and CD parallel, and angles at A and B are right angles. Then AD and BC are the legs.\\nBut then if angle at A and B are both 90, and AB top, then AD and BC both vertical? Then it would be a rectangle, but sides different.\\nMore likely: one right angle at end of one base, one at end of other base.\\nStandard right trapezoid: say AB bottom base, AD vertical leg, DC top base, CB slanted leg.\\nAngles at A and D are 90 degrees? If AD perpendicular to both bases, then yes, but then it would be rectangle if both ends.\\nTypically, a right trapezoid has two right angles adjacent to each other.\\nFor example, angles at A and B are 90 degrees, with AB the longer base, AD and BC the legs, with AD perpendicular to bases, BC not.\\nBut if both A and B are 90, and AB is base, then legs AD and BC are both perpendicular to AB, so parallel, so it would be a rectangle.\\nContradiction unless parallelogram.\\nSo probably the two right angles are not on the same base.\\nPerhaps on the same leg? No.\\nAnother possibility: the two right angles are at the ends of the same leg.\\nFor example, leg AD is perpendicular to both bases, so angles at A and D are 90 degrees.\\nYes, that's possible. So non-parallel sides: one is perpendicular to the bases, the other is not.\\nSo let’s assume:\\n- AB and DC are parallel, AB bottom, DC top.\\n- AD is perpendicular to both, so height h = length of AD.\\n- Angle at A and D are 90 degrees.\\n- Then angle at B and C may not be.\\nGiven side lengths: 4,4,5,√17.\\nSince two sides are 4, possibly the two legs or something.\\nAD is one leg, length say h.\\nCB is the other leg.\\nAB and DC are bases.\\nSuppose AD = h, and it's one of the 4s or 5 or √17.\\n√17 ≈ 4.123, close to 4.\\nPossibly AD = 4 (height).\\nThen the other leg BC = ?\\nThe difference in bases will be related to the horizontal projection of BC.\\nLet AB = a, DC = b, assume a > b.\\nThen the overhang is a - b, and this is accounted for by the horizontal leg of BC.\\nSince AD is vertical, the horizontal distance between D and C is 0 in x, but C is offset.\\nSet coordinates.\\nPlace A at (0,0), since angle A is 90, AB along x-axis, AD along y-axis.\\nSo A(0,0), B(a,0), D(0,h), C(b,h), since DC is parallel to AB, at height h.\\nThen vector DC = (b,0)? From D(0,h) to C(c_x, c_y), but since parallel to AB (x-axis), c_y = h, and length |DC| = |c_x - 0| = |c_x|, but C is at (c, h) for some c.\\nTo avoid confusion, let C be at (p, h).\\nThen DC = from D(0,h) to C(p,h), so length |p|.\\nAB = from A(0,0) to B(a,0), length |a|.\\nLeg AD = from A(0,0) to D(0,h), length h.\\nLeg BC = from B(a,0) to C(p,h), length sqrt((p-a)^2 + (h-0)^2) = sqrt((p-a)^2 + h^2)\\nNow, the four side lengths are:\\n- AB = a (assume a>0)\\n- DC = |p| (since from 0 to p, length |p|)\\n- AD = h\\n- BC = sqrt((p-a)^2 + h^2)\\nGiven values: 4,4,5,√17.\\nTwo sides are 4.\\nPossibility 1: the two legs are both 4. So AD = h = 4, and BC = 4.\\nThen BC = sqrt((p-a)^2 + 16) = 4 → (p-a)^2 + 16 = 16 → (p-a)^2=0 → p=a\\nThen C is at (a,h), D at (0,h), so DC = |a|, same as AB.\\nSo AB = DC = a, and it's a rectangle.\\nThen sides: AB=a, BC=4, CD=a, DA=4.\\nSo two sides 4, and two sides a.\\nGiven sides include 5 and √17, so a must be 5 or √17.\\nBut there are two of them, but given only one 5 and one √17, contradiction.\\nSo cannot have both legs 4.\\nPossibility 2: one leg is 4, the other is something else.\\nSuppose AD = h = 4 (the height).\\nThen AD=4.\\nNow, the other three sides: AB, DC, BC are 4,5,√17 in some order.\\nBut two 4s in total, so one of AB or DC is 4.\\nCase 1: AB = 4.\\nThen a=4.\\nC is at (p,h)=(p,4)\\nDC = |p|\\nBC = sqrt((p-4)^2 + 16)\\nSides: AB=4, AD=4, DC=|p|, BC=sqrt((p-4)^2 + 16)\\nRemaining lengths: 5 and √17 ≈4.123\\nSo |p| is either 5 or √17, and BC the other.\\nSubcase 1: |p| = 5, so p=5 or p=-5\\nIf p=5, DC=5\\nBC = sqrt((5-4)^2 + 16) = sqrt(1 + 16) = sqrt(17) ≈4.123, good.\\nIf p=-5, DC=5, BC=sqrt((-5-4)^2 + 16)=sqrt(81+16)=sqrt(97)≠5 or √17\\nSo only p=5.\\nSo points: A(0,0), B(4,0), D(0,4), C(5,4)\\nThen AB=4, BC=sqrt((5-4)^2+(4-0)^2)=sqrt(1+16)=sqrt(17), CD= from (5,4) to (0,4)? D is (0,4), C(5,4), so CD=5, but direction: from C to D is (-5,0), length 5.\\nDA= from D(0,4) to A(0,0), length 4.\\nSides: AB=4, BC=√17, CD=5, DA=4. So lengths 4,4,5,√17 perfect.\\nNow, angles: at A(0,0): between DA (down) and AB (right), so 90 degrees.\\nAt D(0,4): between CD (from C to D: left) and DA (down), so vector DC is from D to C: (5,0), but angle at D is between sides CD and DA.\\nSides emanating from D: to C and to A.\\nVector DC = (5,0), vector DA = (0,-4)\\nDot product: 5*0 + 0*(-4)=0, so 90 degrees. Good.\\nAt B(4,0): vectors BA=(-4,0), BC=(1,4)\\nDot product: (-4)(1) + (0)(4) = -4 ≠0, not 90.\\nAt C(5,4): vectors CB=(-1,-4), CD=(-5,0), dot product: (-1)(-5) + (-4)(0)=5≠0.\\nSo only two right angles, at A and D. Good.\\nNow, is it a trapezoid? AB and DC: AB from (0,0) to (4,0), so along x-axis. DC from D(0,4) to C(5,4), so from (0,4) to (5,4), which is horizontal, so yes, both horizontal, so parallel. Good.\\nSo trapezoid with AB and DC parallel.\\nNow, draw two line segments connecting midpoints of opposite sides.\\nFirst, find midpoints.\\nLabel:\\nSide AB: from A(0,0) to B(4,0), midpoint M_ab = ((0+4)/2, (0+0)/2) = (2, 0)\\nSide BC: from B(4,0) to C(5,4), midpoint M_bc = ((4+5)/2, (0+4)/2) = (4.5, 2)\\nSide CD: from C(5,4) to D(0,4), midpoint M_cd = ((5+0)/2, (4+4)/2) = (2.5, 4)\\nSide DA: from D(0,4) to A(0,0), midpoint M_da = ((0+0)/2, (4+0)/2) = (0, 2)\\nNow, opposite sides: in a quadrilateral, opposite sides are AB and CD, AD and BC.\\nSo connect midpoints of AB and CD: M_ab(2,0) and M_cd(2.5,4)\\nAnd connect midpoints of AD and BC: M_da(0,2) and M_bc(4.5,2)\\nSo two segments:\\n1. From (2,0) to (2.5,4)\\n2. From (0,2) to (4.5,2)\\nNote the second one is horizontal, since both y=2.\\nThese two segments divide the trapezoid into 4 regions.\\nWe need to find the areas of these 4 regions, then the difference between largest and smallest, then 240 times that difference.\\nFirst, plot the points to understand.\\nTrapezoid: A(0,0), B(4,0), C(5,4), D(0,4)\\nSo from (0,0) to (4,0) to (5,4) to (0,4) back to (0,0).\\nMidpoint segments:\\n- Horizontal segment from (0,2) to (4.5,2)\\n- Diagonal segment from (2,0) to (2.5,4)\\nThey intersect somewhere.\\nFind intersection point.\\nLine 1: from (0,2) to (4.5,2), so y=2, x from 0 to 4.5\\nLine 2: from (2,0) to (2.5,4)\\nSlope = (4-0)/(2.5-2) = 4 / 0.5 = 8\\nEquation: y - 0 = 8(x - 2), so y = 8x - 16\\nIntersect with y=2:\\n2 = 8x - 16 → 8x = 18 → x = 18/8 = 9/4 = 2.25\\ny=2\\nSo intersection at (2.25, 2)\\nNow, the two segments cross at (2.25,2)\\nNow, these two lines divide the trapezoid into 4 regions.\\nTo find the areas, we can find the polygons formed.\\nList the regions.\\nConsider the trapezoid and the two lines.\\nThe horizontal line at y=2 from x=0 to x=4.5, but the trapezoid at y=2: left side x=0 (from D to A), right side: the side BC from B(4,0) to C(5,4)\\nEquation of BC: from (4,0) to (5,4), slope=4, so y-0=4(x-4), y=4x-16\\nAt y=2: 2=4x-16 → 4x=18 → x=4.5, yes, so at (4.5,2), which is on BC, as we have.\\nSimilarly, the diagonal line from (2,0) on AB to (2.5,4) on CD.\\nCD is from (0,4) to (5,4), so y=4, x from 0 to 5, so (2.5,4) is on it.\\nAB is y=0, x from 0 to 4, (2,0) on it.\\nThe diagonal line y=8x-16, from (2,0) to (2.5,4)\\nNow, the two lines cross at (2.25,2)\\nNow, the four regions:\\n1. Bottom-left: bounded by A(0,0), M_ab(2,0), intersection P(2.25,2), M_da(0,2), back to A(0,0)\\nFrom A to M_ab along AB, then to P along the diagonal, then to M_da along the horizontal? But M_da is (0,2), and P is (2.25,2), so along y=2 from P to M_da? But that would be leftward.\\nActually, the segments are from M_ab to M_cd and from M_da to M_bc.\\nSo the lines are:\\n- L1: M_da(0,2) to M_bc(4.5,2) — horizontal\\n- L2: M_ab(2,0) to M_cd(2.5,4) — diagonal\\nThey intersect at P(2.25,2)\\nNow, the trapezoid has vertices A,B,C,D.\\nTo find the four regions, we can consider the polygons formed by the intersection.\\nRegion 1: near A(0,0)\\nVertices: A(0,0), M_ab(2,0), P(2.25,2), M_da(0,2), back to A(0,0)\\nIs that correct? From A to M_ab along bottom, M_ab to P along diagonal, P to M_da along horizontal (since both at y=2, and x from 2.25 to 0), then M_da to A along left side.\\nYes, and this is a quadrilateral.\\nRegion 2: near B(4,0)\\nFrom B(4,0), to M_ab(2,0)? But M_ab is at (2,0), B at (4,0), so along AB.\\nBut from B to M_ab is part of AB, but M_ab is connected to P, but P is not directly connected to B.\\nAfter M_ab, the diagonal goes to P, but from B, we have to go to M_bc or something.\\nList all vertices and connections.\\nThe two added segments divide the trapezoid.\\nStarting from B(4,0): connected to M_ab(2,0) along AB, but also to M_bc(4.5,2) along BC? M_bc is midpoint of BC.\\nBut the segments added are only between midpoints, not necessarily along the sides.\\nThe existing sides are still there.\\nSo the full graph has vertices: A,B,C,D,M_ab,M_bc,M_cd,M_da,P(intersection)\\nBut P is on both new segments.\\nEdges:\\n- Original sides: A-M_ab-B, B-M_bc-C, C-M_cd-D, D-M_da-A\\n- New segments: M_ab-P-M_cd (since M_ab to M_cd via P), and M_da-P-M_bc (M_da to M_bc via P)\\nSo actually, the segments are broken at P.\\nSo edges: M_ab to P, P to M_cd; M_da to P, P to M_bc.\\nNow, the faces (regions):\\nWe can list the cycles.\\nRegion 1: A - M_ab - P - M_da - A\\nAs above.\\nRegion 2: M_ab - B - M_bc - P - M_ab\\nVertices: M_ab(2,0), B(4,0), M_bc(4.5,2), P(2.25,2), back to M_ab(2,0)\\nFrom M_ab to B along AB, B to M_bc along BC, M_bc to P along the horizontal segment (since both at y=2? M_bc(4.5,2), P(2.25,2), and the segment is from M_da to M_bc at y=2, so yes, from M_bc to P along y=2), then P to M_ab along the diagonal.\\nYes.\\nRegion 3: P - M_bc - C - M_cd - P\\nVertices: P(2.25,2), M_bc(4.5,2), C(5,4), M_cd(2.5,4), back to P(2.25,2)\\nFrom P to M_bc along horizontal, M_bc to C along BC, C to M_cd along CD, M_cd to P along the diagonal (since M_cd to M_ab via P, so M_cd to P).\\nYes.\\nRegion 4: M_da - P - M_cd - D - M_da\\nVertices: M_da(0,2), P(2.25,2), M_cd(2.5,4), D(0,4), back to M_da(0,2)\\nFrom M_da to P along horizontal, P to M_cd along diagonal, M_cd to D along CD, D to M_da along DA.\\nYes.\\nSo four regions:\\nR1: quad A(0,0), M_ab(2,0), P(2.25,2), M_da(0,2)\\nR2: quad M_ab(2,0), B(4,0), M_bc(4.5,2), P(2.25,2)\\nR3: quad P(2.25,2), M_bc(4.5,2), C(5,4), M_cd(2.5,4)\\nR4: quad M_da(0,2), P(2.25,2), M_cd(2.5,4), D(0,4)\\nNow compute area of each.\\nUse shoelace formula.\\nFirst, R1: A(0,0), M_ab(2,0), P(2.25,2), M_da(0,2), back to (0,0)\\nShoelace:\\nx   y\\n0   0\\n2   0\\n2.25 2\\n0   2\\n0   0  (back)\\nSum x_i y_{i+1}: 0*0 + 2*2 + 2.25*2 + 0*0 = 0 + 4 + 4.5 + 0 = 8.5\\nSum y_i x_{i+1}: 0*2 + 0*2.25 + 2*0 + 2*0 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0? Wait no\\nShoelace: sum x_i y_{i+1} minus sum y_i x_{i+1}\\nList points in order:\\n1. (0,0)\\n2. (2,0)\\n3. (2.25,2)\\n4. (0,2)\\n5. (0,0)\\nNow, sum x_i y_{i+1}:\\ni=1: x1 y2 = 0 * 0 = 0\\ni=2: x2 y3 = 2 * 2 = 4\\ni=3: x3 y4 = 2.25 * 2 = 4.5\\ni=4: x4 y5 = 0 * 0 = 0\\nSum = 0+4+4.5+0=8.5\\nSum y_i x_{i+1}:\\ni=1: y1 x2 = 0 * 2 = 0\\ni=2: y2 x3 = 0 * 2.25 = 0\\ni=3: y3 x4 = 2 * 0 = 0\\ni=4: y4 x5 = 2 * 0 = 0\\nSum = 0\\nArea = (1/2) |8.5 - 0| = 4.25\\nBut is that right? This is a trapezoid itself: from x=0 to x=2 at bottom, but top from x=0 to x=2.25? Points: left side x=0, y=0 to 2; bottom y=0, x=0 to 2; right side from (2,0) to (2.25,2); top from (2.25,2) to (0,2)? But (0,2) to (2.25,2) is not direct, but in polygon it is.\\nActually, from (2.25,2) to (0,2) is horizontal, and from (0,2) to (0,0) vertical.\\nSo it's a quadrilateral with two vertical sides? No, only left side is vertical.\\nWe can compute as polygon.\\nNote that from x=0 to x=2, but the top is at y=2, but the right boundary is from (2,0) to (2.25,2), which is a line.\\nBetter to use shoelace carefully.\\nPoints in order: (0,0), (2,0), (2.25,2), (0,2), (0,0)\\nShoelace:\\nList coordinates in order:\\n0,0\\n2,0\\n2.25,2\\n0,2\\n0,0  (close)\\nNow, sum of x_i y_{i+1}:\\n0*0 (x1 y2) = 0*0=0? y2 is y of second point, which is 0\\nStandard shoelace: sum from i=1 to n of (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i), with (x_{n+1},y_{n+1}) = (x_1,y_1)\\nSo better:\\nTerm i=1: x1 y2 - x2 y1 = 0*0 - 2*0 = 0 - 0 = 0\\ni=2: x2 y3 - x3 y2 = 2*2 - 2.25*0 = 4 - 0 = 4\\ni=3: x3 y4 - x4 y3 = 2.25*2 - 0*2 = 4.5 - 0 = 4.5\\ni=4: x4 y1 - x1 y4 = 0*0 - 0*2 = 0 - 0 = 0\\nSum = 0+4+4.5+0=8.5\\nArea = (1/2) |sum| = (1/2)*8.5 = 4.25\\nBut visually: it's a trapezoid with parallel sides: bottom from (0,0) to (2,0), length 2; top from (0,2) to (2.25,2), length 2.25? But not parallel to bottom? Both horizontal, so yes, parallel.\\nHeight is 2 (in y-direction).\\nBut the sides are not vertical, so area of trapezoid = (sum of parallel sides) * height / 2 = (2 + 2.25) * 2 / 2 = (4.25)*2/2 = 4.25, yes.\\nGood.\\nNow R2: M_ab(2,0), B(4,0), M_bc(4.5,2), P(2.25,2), back to M_ab(2,0)\\nPoints: (2,0), (4,0), (4.5,2), (2.25,2), (2,0)\\nShoelace:\\ni=1: x1=2,y1=0; x2=4,y2=0; term: 2*0 - 4*0 = 0-0=0\\ni=2: x2=4,y2=0; x3=4.5,y3=2; 4*2 - 4.5*0 = 8 - 0 = 8\\ni=3: x3=4.5,y3=2; x4=2.25,y4=2; 4.5*2 - 2.25*2 = 9 - 4.5 = 4.5\\ni=4: x4=2.25,y4=2; x1=2,y1=0; 2.25*0 - 2*2 = 0 - 4 = -4\\nSum = 0 + 8 + 4.5 - 4 = 8.5\\nArea = (1/2) |8.5| = 4.25\\nSame as R1.\\nNow R3: P(2.25,2), M_bc(4.5,2), C(5,4), M_cd(2.5,4), back to P(2.25,2)\\nPoints: (2.25,2), (4.5,2), (5,4), (2.5,4), (2.25,2)\\nShoelace:\\ni=1: x1=2.25,y1=2; x2=4.5,y2=2; term: 2.25*2 - 4.5*2 = 4.5 - 9 = -4.5\\ni=2: x2=4.5,y2=2; x3=5,y3=4; 4.5*4 - 5*2 = 18 - 10 = 8\\ni=3: x3=5,y3=4; x4=2.5,y4=4; 5*4 - 2.5*4 = 20 - 10 = 10\\ni=4: x4=2.5,y4=4; x1=2.25,y1=2; 2.5*2 - 2.25*4 = 5 - 9 = -4\\nSum = -4.5 + 8 + 10 - 4 = 9.5\\nArea = (1/2) |9.5| = 4.75\\nNow R4: M_da(0,2), P(2.25,2), M_cd(2.5,4), D(0,4), back to M_da(0,2)\\nPoints: (0,2), (2.25,2), (2.5,4), (0,4), (0,2)\\nShoelace:\\ni=1: x1=0,y1=2; x2=2.25,y2=2; 0*2 - 2.25*2 = 0 - 4.5 = -4.5\\ni=2: x2=2.25,y2=2; x3=2.5,y3=4; 2.25*4 - 2.5*2 = 9 - 5 = 4\\ni=3: x3=2.5,y3=4; x4=0,y4=4; 2.5*4 - 0*4 = 10 - 0 = 10\\ni=4: x4=0,y4=4; x1=0,y1=2; 0*2 - 0*4 = 0 - 0 = 0\\nSum = -4.5 + 4 + 10 + 0 = 9.5\\nArea = (1/2) * |9.5| = 4.75\\nSo areas: R1: 4.25, R2: 4.25, R3: 4.75, R4: 4.75\\nSo smallest is 4.25, largest is 4.75, difference d = 4.75 - 4.25 = 0.5\\nThen 240d = 240 * 0.5 = 120\\nBut is that correct? The trapezoid total area should be sum of regions: 4.25+4.25+4.75+4.75 = 8.5 + 9.5 = 18\\nNow compute area of trapezoid T: bases AB=4, DC=5, height=4 (since from y=0 to y=4)\\nArea = (sum of bases)/2 * height = (4+5)/2 * 4 = 4.5 * 4 = 18, yes matches.\\nSo d = 0.5, 240d = 120\\nBut the problem says \"the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest of these regions is d\", so d=0.5, 240d=120.\\nBut let me confirm if the regions are correctly identified.\\nNotice that R1 and R2 both 4.25, R3 and R4 both 4.75, so min 4.25, max 4.75, diff 0.5.\\nBut is there a region missing? Total 18, sum 4.25*2 + 4.75*2 = 8.5 + 9.5=18, good.\\nSo answer should be 120.\\nBut the problem has side lengths including √17, but in area calculation, it worked out with decimals, but 0.5 is exact.\\n4.25 = 17/4, 4.75=19/4, diff=2/4=0.5, yes.\\nSo 240 * 0.5 = 120.\\nThus answers: Problem 1: 720, Problem 2: 120.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"720\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"120\"\n}",
