Two diameters and one radius are drawn, dividing the circle into 5 sectors. We are to maximize the smallest sector's area.\\n\\nLet’s analyze what these lines mean:\\n- A diameter passes through the center and splits the circle symmetrically.\\n- Two diameters mean two lines through the center, creating angles at the center.\\n- One additional radius (not forming a diameter) means a single line from center to circumference, not opposite to another.\\n\\nBut wait: if we draw two diameters, that already involves four radii (each diameter consists of two opposite radii). So saying “two diameters and one radius” likely means three distinct lines from the center: two of them are opposite (forming a diameter), another pair forms a second diameter, and then an additional radius — but this would imply more than three lines unless the third radius coincides or overlaps.\\n\\nWait — perhaps it's better interpreted as: we draw two full diameters (so two lines through the center, possibly at some angle), and one additional radius (a single segment from center to circumference). But since diameters already include two radii each, adding one more radius adds a third direction.\\n\\nBut geometrically, each diameter contributes two opposite rays. So drawing two diameters gives us up to four rays (if they are not overlapping), but if they intersect at an angle, they define 4 sectors. Adding a single radius (a fifth ray) will split one of those sectors into two, resulting in 5 sectors total.\\n\\nYes! That matches: start with two diameters. If they are perpendicular, they divide the circle into 4 equal quadrants. But if they are at some angle θ ≠ 90°, they create 4 sectors. Then, adding a single extra radius (not part of either diameter) — i.e., a third ray from the center — will lie in one of the existing sectors and split it into two, making 5 sectors total.\\n\\nSo we have 3 distinct directions (rays) from the center:\\n- Two diameters → implies 2 lines through center → 4 rays, but only 2 distinct angles (since opposite rays are colinear).\\n- Wait — actually, two diameters mean 2 lines, each contributing two opposite rays, so potentially 4 rays at angles: θ, θ+π, φ, φ+π.\\n- These two lines intersect at the center, forming 4 sectors.\\n- Now, “one radius” — but all rays are radii. Perhaps the phrasing means: we have two full diameters (so two lines) and one additional *single* radius (i.e., a ray not completing a diameter)? That doesn't make sense because a radius alone doesn’t add a line unless it's just a segment.\\n\\nBut for dividing the circle into sectors, only the angular positions matter. Each line through the center (a diameter) contributes two opposite directions. So two diameters give us up to 4 rays, but only two independent angles modulo π.\\n\\nHowever, if the two diameters are not perpendicular, say at angle α between them, then the four sectors have angles: α, π−α, α, π−α? No.\\n\\nActually, when two lines cross at the center, they form two pairs of vertical angles. Suppose the angle between the two diameters is θ (acute or obtuse), then the four central angles are: θ, π−θ, θ, π−θ, arranged alternately.\\n\\nSo the four sector angles are: θ, π−θ, θ, π−θ.\\n\\nNow, we add one additional radius — meaning a third ray from the center, at some angle, not aligned with any existing diameter. This ray will lie within one of the four sectors and split it into two smaller sectors.\\n\\nThus, we go from 4 sectors to 5 sectors.\\n\\nOur goal is to choose the angle θ between the two diameters and the position of the third radius such that the smallest of the five resulting sectors has maximum possible area. We want to maximize the minimum sector area.\\n\\nLet’s denote the central angles of the sectors. Initially, two diameters at angle θ apart (0 < θ ≤ π/2, WLOG take acute angle) create four sectors with angles: θ, π−θ, θ, π−θ.\\n\\nNow, we place a third radius inside one of these sectors. To maximize the smallest sector, we should probably place it in the largest sector, so as not to leave a very small leftover.\\n\\nThe larger of θ and π−θ is π−θ (since θ ≤ π/2 ⇒ π−θ ≥ π/2 ≥ θ).\\n\\nSo the largest initial sectors have angle π−θ. We should place the new radius in one of those.\\n\\nSuppose we split a sector of angle π−θ into two parts: x and (π−θ)−x, with 0 < x < π−θ.\\n\\nThen the five sector angles are:\\n- θ (from first pair)\\n- θ (second copy)\\n- x\\n- (π−θ)−x\\n- and the other two: one π−θ remains, and one θ?\\nWait no: originally four sectors: θ, π−θ, θ, π−θ.\\nWe split one of the π−θ sectors into x and (π−θ)−x.\\nSo now the five sector angles are:\\n- θ\\n- θ\\n- π−θ  (the unsplit large one)\\n- x\\n- (π−θ)−x\\n\\nSo angles: θ, θ, π−θ, x, (π−θ)−x.\\n\\nWe can choose θ ∈ (0, π/2] and x ∈ (0, π−θ).\\n\\nWe want to maximize the minimum of {θ, π−θ, x, (π−θ)−x}.\\nNote: θ appears twice, π−θ once (the unsplit one), and x and (π−θ)−x.\\n\\nLet m be the minimum of these five values. We want to maximize m.\\n\\nTo maximize the minimum, ideally all five values are equal, but we have duplicates.\\nBut we have two θs, so θ must be at least m.\\nSimilarly, π−θ must be ≥ m (since it's one of the values),\\nx ≥ m,\\n(π−θ)−x ≥ m.\\n\\nFrom x ≥ m and (π−θ)−x ≥ m, adding: π−θ ≥ 2m ⇒ m ≤ (π−θ)/2.\\nAlso, θ ≥ m, and π−θ ≥ m.\\n\\nSo constraints:\\n1. θ ≥ m\\n2. π−θ ≥ m\\n3. π−θ ≥ 2m  (from splitting)\\n\\nFrom (2) and (3), (3) is stronger if m > 0, since 2m > m for m > 0. So (3) implies (2).\\nSo relevant constraints:\\n- θ ≥ m\\n- π−θ ≥ 2m\\n\\nWe want to maximize m.\\n\\nFrom π−θ ≥ 2m ⇒ θ ≤ π − 2m\\nFrom θ ≥ m\\nSo m ≤ θ ≤ π − 2m\\nThus, m ≤ π − 2m ⇒ 3m ≤ π ⇒ m ≤ π/3\\n\\nCan we achieve m = π/3?\\nThen θ ≥ π/3 and θ ≤ π − 2(π/3) = π − 2π/3 = π/3\\nSo θ = π/3\\nThen π−θ = π − π/3 = 2π/3\\nThen we need to split this 2π/3 sector into x and 2π/3 − x, each at least m = π/3\\nSo x ≥ π/3, 2π/3 − x ≥ π/3 ⇒ x ≤ π/3\\nThus x = π/3\\nSo set x = π/3\\nThen the five sector angles are:\\n- θ = π/3\\n- θ = π/3\\n- π−θ = 2π/3  (but wait — we split one π−θ sector, so the other π−θ sector remains)\\nWait: original two π−θ sectors? No:\\nTwo diameters at angle θ = π/3 apart.\\nThe four sectors alternate: θ, π−θ, θ, π−θ → π/3, 2π/3, π/3, 2π/3\\nWe split one of the 2π/3 sectors into x and (2π/3 - x)\\nSet x = π/3, so split into π/3 and π/3\\nThen the five sector angles are:\\n- π/3 (from θ)\\n- π/3 (other θ)\\n- 2π/3 (the unsplit large sector)\\n- π/3 (first half of split)\\n- π/3 (second half)\\nSo list: π/3, π/3, 2π/3, π/3, π/3\\nSo the five angles: four of π/3 and one of 2π/3\\nThus the smallest sector has angle π/3\\nArea of a sector is (1/2) r² θ = (1/2)(1)² θ = θ/2\\nSo smallest sector area = (π/3)/2 = π/6\\nBut is this correct? Area = (central angle / 2π) * total area = (θ / 2π) * π = θ/2, yes.\\nSo smallest area is π/6\\nBut is this the maximum possible min area?\\nWe achieved m = π/3 radians for angle, area = π/6\\nAnd earlier we had m ≤ π/3, so this is optimal.\\nBut wait: the problem says “two diameters and one radius” — does this configuration satisfy that?\\nWe have two diameters: yes, two lines through center at angle π/3.\\nAnd “one radius” — but we added one additional radius, which is a ray. In this case, we added a ray that splits the 2π/3 sector into two π/3 sectors. Since the sector was 2π/3, and we placed a radius at π/3 from one end, yes.\\nBut is this “one radius” in addition to the diameters? The diameters already include their own radii. But the “one radius” likely refers to an additional radial line segment, i.e., a third direction.\\nIn this case, we now have three distinct directions: the two diameter lines (two directions, but each with opposite rays), and the new radius adds a third direction.\\nBut the two diameters give two lines, hence two angles (mod π), and the third radius is a third line? Or just a single ray?\\nFor sector division, only the angular positions matter. The two diameters define 4 rays at angles: say 0, π/3, π, π + π/3 = 4π/3\\nSet one diameter along 0 and π, the other along π/3 and π + π/3 = 4π/3\\nThen the angles between them: from 0 to π/3: π/3, π/3 to π: 2π/3? Wait:\\nOrder around circle: 0, π/3, π, 4π/3, back to 2π=0\\nAngles:\\n- 0 to π/3: π/3\\n- π/3 to π: π - π/3 = 2π/3\\n- π to 4π/3: 4π/3 - π = π/3\\n- 4π/3 to 2π: 2π - 4π/3 = 2π/3\\nYes: sectors of π/3, 2π/3, π/3, 2π/3\\nNow we add one additional radius. To split one 2π/3 sector into two π/3, we place a radius at, say, angle π/3 + π/3 = 2π/3? From π/3 to π is 2π/3; to split into two π/3, place a radius at π/3 + π/3 = 2π/3.\\nSo add a radius at 2π/3.\\nNow the rays are at: 0, π/3, 2π/3, π, 4π/3\\nAnd the sectors:\\n- 0 to π/3: π/3\\n- π/3 to 2π/3: π/3\\n- 2π/3 to π: π/3\\n- π to 4π/3: π/3\\n- 4π/3 to 2π: 2π/3\\nWait, last one: 2π - 4π/3 = 2π/3\\nSo angles: π/3, π/3, π/3, π/3, 2π/3\\nSame as before, min is π/3\\nBut we have five rays: 0, π/3, 2π/3, π, 4π/3\\nBut 0 and π are opposite (diameter), π/3 and 4π/3 = π/3 + π are opposite? 4π/3 - π/3 = π, yes, so that's a diameter.\\nAnd 2π/3 — where is its opposite? 2π/3 + π = 5π/3, which is not present.\\nSo we have two full diameters: one along 0-π, one along π/3-4π/3, and one additional radius at 2π/3 (without its opposite).\\nYes! So exactly: two diameters and one radius (a single radius, not paired).\\nPerfect.\\nSo the five sectors have central angles: four of π/3 and one of 2π/3.\\nThe areas are proportional to angles, since area = (1/2) r² θ = θ/2 (r=1)\\nSo smallest sector area = (π/3)/2 = π/6\\nAs a fraction: π/6 = (1/6) π, so a/b = 1/6, a=1, b=6, relatively prime.\\nThen 100a + b = 100*1 + 6 = 106\\n\\nBut wait: is there a way to get a larger minimum?\\nSuppose we try to make all five sectors more balanced.\\nTotal angle 2π.\\nIf we could make five equal sectors, each 2π/5, area (2π/5)/2 = π/5 ≈ 0.628, while π/6 ≈ 0.523, so π/5 > π/6, so better.\\nBut can we achieve min area π/5?\\nThat would require all sector angles ≥ 2π/5? No: area = θ/2, so to have area ≥ π/5, need θ/2 ≥ π/5 ⇒ θ ≥ 2π/5\\nSo we need all central angles ≥ 2π/5\\nTotal sum of angles = 2π\\nMinimum possible sum if all ≥ 2π/5 is 5*(2π/5) = 2π, so equality only if all exactly 2π/5\\nSo we need five equal sectors of 2π/5 each.\\nIs this possible with two diameters and one radius?\\nFive equal sectors would require five equally spaced rays, at angles 0, 2π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, 8π/5\\nNow, which of these are opposite?\\nCheck if any two differ by π:\\n2π/5 and 2π/5 + π = 7π/5, but 7π/5 = 1.4π, while 8π/5=1.6π, not equal.\\n4π/5 + π = 9π/5 = 1.8π, not in list (8π/5=1.6π)\\n6π/5 + π = 11π/5 = 2.2π ≡ 0.2π = π/5, not in list\\n8π/5 + π = 13π/5 = 2.6π ≡ 0.6π = 3π/5, not in list\\n0 + π = π = 5π/5, not in list\\nSo no two are opposite. But we need two full diameters, meaning two pairs of opposite rays.\\nHere, no ray has its opposite present. So we cannot form even one diameter, let alone two.\\nThus, impossible to have five equal sectors.\\nSo maximum min cannot be π/5.\\nBut perhaps we can get closer.\\nWe need at least two pairs of opposite rays (for two diameters).\\nSo among the five rays, we need two pairs that are antipodal.\\nLet the rays be at angles α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄, α₅\\nWith αᵢ+π ≡ αⱼ mod 2π for two pairs.\\nSince it's a circle, we can fix one diameter along 0 and π.\\nSo rays at 0 and π are included.\\nNow, second diameter: suppose at angle β and β+π.\\nSo rays at β and β+π.\\nNow, we have four rays: 0, π, β, β+π\\nThese form four sectors.\\nNow, we add one more radius — a fifth ray, at angle γ, not equal to any of the above.\\nThis splits one sector into two.\\nSo total five sectors.\\nNow, the configuration is determined by β and γ.\\nWe want to maximize the minimum of the five sector angles.\\nDue to symmetry, assume 0 < β ≤ π/2 (since angle between diameters can be taken acute)\\nThe four initial sectors (with two diameters) have angles:\\n- From 0 to β: β\\n- β to π: π−β\\n- π to β+π: β (since β+π − π = β)\\n- β+π to 2π: 2π − (β+π) = π−β\\nSo angles: β, π−β, β, π−β\\nSame as before with θ=β.\\nNow, add a fifth ray at γ.\\nγ must lie in one of the four arcs.\\nTo maximize the minimum, we should place γ in one of the larger sectors.\\nThe larger sectors are those with angle max(β, π−β)\\nSince β ≤ π/2, π−β ≥ π/2 ≥ β, so π−β ≥ β, so larger sectors have angle π−β.\\nThere are two such sectors: (β, π) and (β+π, 2π)\\nBy symmetry, we can assume γ is in (β, π), say.\\nSo β < γ < π\\nThen the sector from β to π is split into (β to γ) and (γ to π), with angles γ−β and π−γ\\nThe five sector angles are:\\n- 0 to β: β\\n- β to γ: γ−β\\n- γ to π: π−γ\\n- π to β+π: β\\n- β+π to 2π: π−β  (unchanged)\\nList:\\n1. β\\n2. γ−β\\n3. π−γ\\n4. β\\n5. π−β\\nSo the five angles: β, β, π−β, γ−β, π−γ\\nWe want to maximize the minimum of {β, π−β, γ−β, π−γ}\\nNote β appears twice, but min depends on values.\\nLet m be the minimum.\\nWe want to maximize m.\\nConstraints:\\nβ ≥ m\\nπ−β ≥ m\\nγ−β ≥ m\\nπ−γ ≥ m\\nFrom γ−β ≥ m and π−γ ≥ m, adding: (γ−β) + (π−γ) = π−β ≥ 2m\\nBut we already have π−β ≥ m, but now stronger: π−β ≥ 2m\\nAlso β ≥ m\\nAnd π−β ≥ 2m ⇒ β ≤ π − 2m\\nSo m ≤ β ≤ π − 2m\\nThus m ≤ π − 2m ⇒ 3m ≤ π ⇒ m ≤ π/3\\nSame as before.\\nEquality when m=π/3, β=π/3, and π−β=2π/3 ≥ 2m=2π/3, so equality, thus γ−β ≥ m=π/3 and π−γ ≥ π/3, and (γ−β)+(π−γ)=π−β=2π/3, so must have γ−β=π/3, π−γ=π/3 ⇒ γ=β+π/3=π/3+π/3=2π/3\\nWhich is what we had earlier.\\nSo indeed, maximum min angle is π/3, min area is (π/3)/2 = π/6\\nThus area = π/6 = (1/6)π, a=1,b=6, gcd(1,6)=1\\n100a+b=100+6=106\\n\\nBut wait: in this configuration, we have rays at 0, π, β=π/3, β+π=4π/3, and γ=2π/3\\nSo angles: 0, π/3, 2π/3, π, 4π/3\\nAs before.\\nSectors:\\n0 to π/3: π/3\\nπ/3 to 2π/3: π/3\\n2π/3 to π: π/3\\nπ to 4π/3: π/3? 4π/3 - π = π/3, yes\\n4π/3 to 2π: 2π - 4π/3 = 2π/3\\nSo four sectors of π/3, one of 2π/3\\nMin angle π/3, area π/6\\nIs there a way to get a larger min area?\\nSuppose we place the extra radius in a smaller sector? But that would make even smaller sectors, so min would be smaller, worse.\\nSuppose the two diameters are perpendicular: β=π/2\\nThen initial sectors: π/2, π/2, π/2, π/2? No\\nβ=π/2, then angles: β=π/2, π−β=π/2, so all four sectors π/2\\nAdd a radius in one sector, say at γ in (0, π/2)\\nSplit into γ and π/2−γ\\nThen five angles: γ, π/2−γ, π/2, π/2, π/2\\nMin is min(γ, π/2−γ, π/2)\\nMax of min occurs when γ=π/4, then min=π/4\\nArea = (π/4)/2 = π/8 ≈ 0.3927\\nWhile π/6≈0.5236, larger.\\nSo worse.\\nSuppose β small, say β→0, then sectors: small β, large π−β≈π, etc.\\nSplitting the large one: can get min up to about π/3 as before.\\nSo seems π/6 is best.\\nBut in our case, min area is π/6, but is there a sector smaller than that? No, all others are larger.\\nBut wait: in the list, we have four sectors of angle π/3, area π/6 each, and one of 2π/3, area (2π/3)/2 = π/3, larger.\\nSo smallest is π/6.\\nBut the problem says “the largest possible area of the smallest sector”, and we got π/6.\\nBut earlier I thought about equal sectors, but not possible.\\nPerhaps if the extra radius is placed such that it allows a higher min.\\nSuppose we want min area corresponding to angle θ_min, so area θ_min / 2\\nSet θ_min as large as possible.\\nFrom earlier inequality, m ≤ π/3 for the angle, so area ≤ π/6.\\nAnd achievable, so it is optimal.\\nThus, answer for Problem 1 is 100*1 + 6 = 106\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nFind the smallest integer greater than 10 such that the sum of the digits in its base 17 representation equals the sum of the digits in its base 10 representation.\\n\\nLet n > 10 be integer.\\nLet s10(n) = sum of decimal digits of n\\ns17(n) = sum of base 17 digits of n\\nWe want s10(n) = s17(n)\\n\\nNote that for any n, s_b(n) ≡ n mod (b-1), by the divisibility rule.\\nSpecifically, s10(n) ≡ n mod 9\\ns17(n) ≡ n mod 16\\nBecause in base b, digit sum ≡ n mod (b-1)\\n\\nSo we have s10(n) ≡ n mod 9\\ns17(n) ≡ n mod 16\\nBut s10(n) = s17(n), so let s = s10(n) = s17(n)\\nThen s ≡ n mod 9\\ns ≡ n mod 16\\nThus n ≡ s mod 9 and n ≡ s mod 16\\nSince 9 and 16 coprime, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, n ≡ s mod 144\\nBecause lcm(9,16)=144\\n\\nSo n ≡ s mod 144\\nBut s = digit sum, which for a number n is generally much smaller than n.\\nSpecifically, for n-digit number, s ≤ 9n in decimal, but more relevantly, s = O(log n)\\nWhile n grows, so for large n, s << n, so n ≡ s mod 144 implies that n - s is divisible by 144, and since s is small, n must be close to a multiple of 144.\\nSpecifically, n = 144k + r, with r = s, and s is digit sum.\\nBut s depends on n, so we can iterate over possible n, starting from 11 upwards, compute both digit sums and check.\\nSince n ≡ s mod 144, and s ≥ 1, and for n>10, s ≥ 1, but more importantly, s is at least the digit sum.\\nMinimal s for n>10 is for n=11, s10=2, but we need to check.\\nBut since n ≡ s mod 144, and s is positive and typically less than, say, 100 for n not too big, then n mod 144 = s mod 144, but since s < 144 probably for small n, then n mod 144 = s\\nThat is, the remainder when n divided by 144 equals the digit sum s.\\nBut s is also equal to s10(n) and s17(n)\\nMoreover, s = n mod 144\\nBut s is digit sum, which for n < 1000, s ≤ 9*3=27 for decimal, but in base 17, digits up to 16, but sum still reasonable.\\nFor example, n=144, s10=1+4+4=9, n mod 144=0, not equal.\\nBut according to above, if s < 144, then s = n mod 144\\nBut n mod 144 is between 0 and 143, and s ≥1 for n≥1, but for n multiple of 144, n mod 144=0, but s≥1, so cannot equal unless s=0, impossible. So n not divisible by 144.\\nSo s = n mod 144, and s = s10(n) = s17(n)\\nMoreover, since s = n mod 144, we have n = 144k + s for some k≥0, and s = s10(n)\\nBut n = 144k + s, and s is sum of digits of n in base 10.\\nNow, for small n, we can compute.\\nStart from n=11 upwards.\\nMake a table.\\nn | s10(n) | base17 rep | s17(n) | equal?\\n11: s10=1+1=2\\n11 in base 17: 17>11, so single digit: 11, which is 'B' if letters, but digit value 11\\nSum=11\\n2 vs 11, no\\n12: s10=1+2=3, base17:12='C', sum=12, 3≠12\\n13:4 vs13\\n14:5 vs14\\n15:6 vs15\\n16:7 vs16\\n17:1+7=8, base17: 17=1*17 +0, so digits (1,0), sum=1+0=1, 8≠1\\n18:1+8=9, base17:18=1*17+1, so (1,1), sum=2, 9≠2\\n19:1+9=10, base17:19=1*17+2, (1,2), sum=3, 10≠3\\n20:2+0=2, base17:20=1*17+3, (1,3), sum=4, 2≠4\\n21:3, (1,4), sum=5, no\\n22:4, (1,5), sum=6, no\\n23:5, (1,6), sum=7, no\\n24:6, (1,7), sum=8, no\\n25:7, (1,8), sum=9, no\\n26:8, (1,9), sum=10, no\\n27:9, (1,10), digit 10='A', sum=1+10=11, 9≠11\\n28:10, (1,11), sum=1+11=12, 10≠12\\n29:11, (1,12), sum=1+12=13, no\\n30:3+0=3, (1,13), sum=1+13=14, no\\n31:4, (1,14), sum=15, no\\n32:5, (1,15), sum=16, no\\n33:6, (1,16), sum=1+16=17, no\\n34:7, (2,0) since 2*17=34, so (2,0), sum=2+0=2, 7≠2\\n35:8, (2,1), sum=3, no\\n... this is slow.\\nNote that for n<17, s17(n)=n, s10(n)<n for n>9, so s10 < s17\\nFor n>=17, s17(n) is roughly proportional to number of digits in base 17.\\nNumber of digits in base 17 is floor(log17 n)+1\\nSimilarly for base 10.\\nBut perhaps continue until we find one.\\nFrom earlier, we have that n ≡ s mod 144, and s = s10(n)\\nAlso, since s17(n) = s, and s17(n) is at least the minimal digit sum.\\nBut perhaps assume s = n mod 144, and s = s10(n)\\nAnd n >10\\nTry n from 11 up, but skip to larger n.\\nNote that for n just above 10, s10(n) is small, s17(n) is at least 1, but for n>=17, s17(n) >=1, but can be small.\\nWhen n is multiple of high powers, digit sum small.\\nBut from the congruence, n ≡ s mod 144, s=s10(n)\\nSuppose n < 144, then n mod 144 = n, so s = n\\nBut s = s10(n), so s10(n) = n\\nBut for n>9, s10(n) < n, since at least two digits, sum of digits less than number itself (e.g., 10:1+0=1<10, 11:2<11, etc.)\\nEquality only for single digit, but n>10, so no.\\nThus for n<144, no solution.\\nSo n >= 144\\nNow, n = 144k + s, with s = s10(n), and s < 144 probably, since for n around 144, s10(n) <= 1+4+4=9 for 144, but 144k + s, for k>=1, n>=144\\ns = s10(n), which for n=144k + s, and s is digit sum, typically much smaller than n.\\nMoreover, s = n mod 144, as established, since n ≡ s mod 144 and 0 < s < 144 (s>=1, and for n>=144, s10(n) >=1, but upper bound: for n<1000, s<=27, for n<10000, s<=36, etc., so for n not too big, s<144)\\nSo assume s < 144, then n mod 144 = s, so s = n - 144k for some k, but n = 144k + r, r = n mod 144, and r=s\\nSo s = n mod 144\\nThus, we need s10(n) = n mod 144\\nAnd also s17(n) = s10(n)\\nBut since we have s10(n) = n mod 144, we can search for n such that sum of decimal digits equals n modulo 144.\\nStart from n=144\\nn=144: s10=1+4+4=9, n mod 144=0, 9≠0\\nn=145:1+4+5=10, 145 mod 144=1, 10≠1\\nn=146:1+4+6=11, 146-144=2, 11≠2\\nn=147:12,3,no\\nn=148:13,4,no\\nn=149:14,5,no\\nn=150:1+5+0=6,150-144=6, oh! 6=6\\nSo s10(n)=6, n mod 144=6\\nNow check s17(n): n=150\\nConvert 150 to base 17\\n17^2=289>150, so two digits\\n17*8=136, 150-136=14, so 8*17 + 14, so digits (8,14)\\nSum=8+14=22\\ns10=6, 6≠22, not equal\\nBut we need s17(n)=s10(n)=6, but 22≠6\\nSo no\\nContinue\\nn=151: s10=1+5+1=7, n mod 144=151-144=7, 7=7\\nNow s17(150): 151 /17=8*17=136, 151-136=15, so (8,15), sum=8+15=23≠7\\nn=152: s10=1+5+2=8, mod144=8, good\\ns17:152-136=16, (8,16), sum=24≠8\\nn=153: s10=9, mod144=9, good\\ns17:153-136=17? 17, but 17>=17, so 153 /17=9*17=153, exactly, so (9,0), sum=9+0=9\\ns10=9, so 9=9! Equal!\\ns17=9, s10=9\\nNow n=153>10, and greater than 10\\nIs this the smallest? We started from 144, and checked 144 to 153\\nBefore 144, we said no solution since n<144 implies s10(n)=n only if single digit, not possible\\nBut n=153 is first one where s10(n)=n mod 144 and we have equality in digit sums\\nBut is there any n between 11 and 144 that satisfies s10(n)=s17(n)? Earlier we assumed not because n not equiv s mod 144, but is that necessary?\\nEarlier we derived that if s10(n)=s17(n)=s, then s≡n mod 9 and s≡n mod 16, so n≡s mod 144\\nYes, since 9 and 16 coprime, lcm=144\\nSo n ≡ s mod 144 is necessary\\nFor n<144, n mod 144 = n, so s=n, but s=s10(n)<n for n>9, contradiction\\nThus no solution below 144\\nSo 153 is the smallest possible candidate we found\\nBut confirm:\\nn=153\\nBase 10: digits 1,5,3 sum=1+5+3=9\\nBase 17: 17*9=153, so 9*17^1 + 0*17^0, so digits (9,0), sum=9+0=9\\nEqual!\\nAnd n>10\\nIs there any smaller n>=144 that satisfies? We checked from 144 to 152, none had s10(n)=n mod 144 except 150,151,152,153\\n150: s10=6, n mod 144=6, but s17=22≠6\\n151: s10=7, mod=7, s17=23≠7\\n152: s10=8, mod=8, s17=24≠8\\n153: works\\nSo yes, 153 is the smallest\\nBut the problem asks for the smallest integer greater than 10, and 153>10, and no smaller, so answer is 153\\nBut just to be sure, is there any n<153 with n>=144 that we missed? n=144 to 152 we checked the ones where s10(n)=n mod 144, but only 150,151,152,153 in that range satisfy s10(n)=n mod 144? Let's verify:\\nn=144: s10=9, mod=0, 9≠0\\n145:10,1,no\\n146:11,2,no\\n147:12,3,no\\n148:13,4,no\\n149:14,5,no\\n150:6,6,yes\\n151:7,7,yes\\n152:8,8,yes\\n153:9,9,yes\\nOthers don't satisfy s10(n)=n mod 144, so cannot satisfy the necessary condition, so no need to check s17\\nThus 153 is the smallest\\nSo answer is 153\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"106\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"153\"\n}",
