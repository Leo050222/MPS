  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\n\\nWe are given a knockout tournament with 32 players, including Ava and Tiffany. The tournament proceeds in 5 rounds (since $ \\\\log_2(32) = 5 $), and in each round, the remaining players are paired at random. In each match, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is eliminated. We are to compute the probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other at some point during the tournament.\\n\\nKey idea: Two players can only meet if they are in the same branch of the bracket. But since pairings are completely randomized in each round (not fixed bracket), we need to compute the probability that Ava and Tiffany are ever paired together in one of the 5 rounds.\\n\\nLet’s consider the structure:\\n- Round 1: 32 players → 16 matches\\n- Round 2: 16 players → 8 matches\\n- Round 3: 8 → 4\\n- Round 4: 4 → 2\\n- Round 5: 2 → 1 (final)\\n\\nAt each round, the remaining players are randomly paired. We want the probability that Ava and Tiffany are paired in **some** round before one of them is eliminated.\\n\\nBut note: they can only play if they both survive until a round and are then paired.\\n\\nAlternative approach: Think about the entire tournament. There are 31 matches total (each eliminates one player). Every pair of players either plays or doesn’t. A key insight is symmetry.\\n\\nThere is a well-known result: In a single-elimination tournament with $ 2^n $ players, where pairings are random in each round and winners are decided by fair coin flips, the probability that two specific players meet during the tournament is $ \\\\frac{2}{2^n} \\\\times (2^n - 1) $? Wait — no, that doesn’t make sense.\\n\\nBetter known result: For such a tournament with random re-pairing at each round (not fixed bracket), the probability that two specific players meet is $ \\\\frac{2}{n} $, where $ n $ is the number of players? Let's test small cases.\\n\\nWait — actually, here's a better way.\\n\\nIdea from probability: Each time both Ava and Tiffany survive, they might be paired.\\n\\nLet’s define $ P(n) $ as the probability that two specific players meet in a tournament with $ n = 2^k $ players under this random pairing model.\\n\\nLet’s try small cases.\\n\\nCase $ n = 2 $: Only two players. They must play. So probability = 1.\\n\\nCase $ n = 4 $: 4 players: Ava, Tiffany, X, Y.\\n\\nRound 1: Random pairing of 4 players into 2 matches.\\n\\nNumber of ways to pair 4 players: 3 (since for 4 labeled players, number of perfect matchings is 3).\\n\\nProbability Ava and Tiffany are paired in round 1: Number of pairings where they are together / total = 1/3.\\n\\nIf not paired in round 1 (prob 2/3), then each plays someone else. Then 2 winners go to final.\\n\\nFor Ava and Tiffany to meet, they must both win their first matches AND meet in the final.\\n\\nSuppose they are not paired in round 1. Then Ava plays X or Y, Tiffany plays the other. Probability Ava wins her match: 1/2. Tiffany wins: 1/2. Independent. So probability both reach final: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.\\n\\nThen in final, they are the only two, so they play. So conditional on not meeting in round 1 but both reaching final, they do meet.\\n\\nSo total probability they meet:\\n= P(meet in round 1) + P(not meet in r1) × P(both win their matches)\\n= 1/3 + (2/3) × (1/4) = 1/3 + 2/12 = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2.\\n\\nSo for $ n = 4 $, probability = 1/2.\\n\\nNow $ n = 8 $: 8 players.\\n\\nRound 1: 8 players. Total number of perfect matchings: $ \\\\frac{1}{4!} \\\\binom{8}{2}\\\\binom{6}{2}\\\\binom{4}{2}\\\\binom{2}{2} $ but easier: number of ways to partition 8 players into 4 unordered pairs.\\n\\nStandard formula: $ (2m-1)!! = (2m)! / (2^m m!) $\\n\\nFor 8 players: $ 7!! = 7×5×3×1 = 105 $.\\n\\nNumber of pairings where Ava and Tiffany are paired: fix them together, then pair remaining 6: $ 5!! = 5×3×1 = 15 $.\\n\\nSo P(paired in round 1) = 15 / 105 = 1/7.\\n\\nIf not paired in round 1 (prob 6/7), then they are in different matches.\\n\\nEach has 1/2 chance to win and advance.\\n\\nP(both advance) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.\\n\\nGiven that both survive, we now have 4 players left, including Ava and Tiffany. But the pairing is again random.\\n\\nNow, the situation reduces to a 4-player tournament starting from round 2, but only if both survive.\\n\\nFrom earlier, in a 4-player tournament, the probability that two specific players meet is 1/2.\\n\\nBut wait — in this case, once we’re down to 4 players, the rest of the tournament proceeds as above. So conditional on both surviving to round 2, the probability they eventually meet is exactly $ P(4) = 1/2 $.\\n\\nTherefore, total probability:\\n= P(meet in round 1) + P(not meet in r1) × P(both survive r1) × P(they meet later | both survived)\\n= 1/7 + (6/7) × (1/4) × (1/2)?\\n\\nWait — no: if they don’t meet in round 1 and both survive, then they are among the 4 in round 2, and from there, the probability they meet at some point in the remainder of the tournament is $ P(4) = 1/2 $, as computed.\\n\\nBut $ P(4) $ includes the possibility they meet in round 2 or in the final.\\n\\nSo yes.\\n\\nThus:\\nP(8) = 1/7 + (6/7) * (1/4) * (1/2)? No — wait: P(both survive) = 1/4, and then conditional on that, P(they meet in remainder) = P(4) = 1/2.\\n\\nBut actually, $ P(4) $ is the total probability from start of 4-player tournament. Since the future is independent, yes.\\n\\nBut note: when we go to 4 players, it’s a fresh random tournament, so the probability Ava and Tiffany meet from that point is indeed 1/2, provided they are both in it.\\n\\nSo:\\nP(8) = P(meet in r1) + P(not meet in r1) × P(both survive r1) × P(meet in future | both in r2)\\n= 1/7 + (6/7) × (1/4) × (1/2)\\n= 1/7 + (6/7)(1/8) = 1/7 + 6/56 = 1/7 + 3/28\\n= 4/28 + 3/28 = 7/28 = 1/4.\\n\\nSo P(8) = 1/4.\\n\\nNow pattern:\\nn=2: P=1 = 2/2\\nn=4: P=1/2 = 2/4\\nn=8: P=1/4 = 2/8\\nSo it seems P(n) = 2/n.\\n\\nCheck: for n=2, 2/2=1 ✓; n=4, 2/4=1/2 ✓; n=8, 2/8=1/4 ✓.\\n\\nSo conjecture: In a random knockout tournament with n=2^k players, random pairing each round, the probability that two specific players meet is $ \\\\frac{2}{n} $.\\n\\nTherefore, for n=32, probability = $ \\\\frac{2}{32} = \\\\frac{1}{16} $.\\n\\nThus $ \\\\frac{a}{b} = \\\\frac{1}{16} $, a=1, b=16, relatively prime.\\n\\nThen $ 100a + b = 100(1) + 16 = 116 $.\\n\\nIs this correct? Let’s justify why $ P(n) = 2/n $.\\n\\nAnother way: Think about the entire tournament. There are n−1 matches (since n−1 players eliminated). Each match involves 2 players. Now, how many pairs of players are there? $ \\\\binom{n}{2} $.\\n\\nBut the expected number of times a specific pair plays is either 0 or 1.\\n\\nBut more importantly: consider that for Ava and Tiffany to meet, they must be in the same half, quarter, etc., but because pairing is random each time, perhaps symmetry applies.\\n\\nAlternate argument: Fix Ava. She plays exactly k matches, where k is the number of rounds she survives. Since each match eliminates one player, and tournament ends when one remains, total matches = n−1 = 31.\\n\\nNow, each match is between two players. Consider all possible pairs. By symmetry, every pair of players is equally likely to meet in some match?\\n\\nBut is that true?\\n\\nNo — two players who are far apart in strength may not meet, but here all are symmetric.\\n\\nActually, due to symmetry, the probability that any two specific players meet should be the same for all pairs.\\n\\nThere are $ \\\\binom{n}{2} $ pairs of players.\\n\\nTotal number of matches played in the tournament: n−1.\\n\\nEach match accounts for one pair meeting.\\n\\nSo sum over all unordered pairs {i,j} of the indicator that i and j meet is exactly n−1.\\n\\nBy linearity of expectation, the expected number of pairs that meet is n−1.\\n\\nBut also, by symmetry, for each pair {i,j}, the probability they meet is the same, say p.\\n\\nThere are $ \\\\binom{n}{2} $ pairs, so:\\n$ \\\\binom{n}{2} p = n - 1 $\\n⇒ $ p = \\\\frac{2(n-1)}{n(n-1)} = \\\\frac{2}{n} $\\n\\nExactly!\\n\\nSo regardless of the randomness model, as long as the process is symmetric with respect to players (which it is: random pairing, fair matches), then the probability that any two specific players meet is $ \\\\frac{2}{n} $.\\n\\nThis is a beautiful argument.\\n\\nThus for n=32, probability = $ \\\\frac{2}{32} = \\\\frac{1}{16} $.\\n\\nSo $ a = 1, b = 16 $, $ 100a + b = 100 + 16 = 116 $.\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 1: 116.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe are given:\\n$ c - 0.1 < x^{p} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{1 + (1+x)^{10}} \\\\right) < c + 0.1 $\\nfor all $ 0 < x < 10^{-100} $, and c is a nonzero integer, p real.\\n\\nWe need to find (p, c) such that this holds.\\n\\nSince x is very small (approaching 0+), we can use asymptotic expansion.\\n\\nLet $ f(x) = x^p \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{1 + (1+x)^{10}} $\\n\\nWe analyze the behavior as $ x \\\\to 0^+ $.\\n\\nFirst, expand $ (1+x)^{10} $ using binomial theorem:\\n$ (1+x)^{10} = 1 + 10x + 45x^2 + 120x^3 + 210x^4 + 252x^5 + 210x^6 + 120x^7 + 45x^8 + 10x^9 + x^{10} $\\n\\nSo:\\nNumerator: $ 1 - (1+x)^{10} = 1 - [1 + 10x + 45x^2 + \\\\cdots ] = -10x - 45x^2 - 120x^3 - \\\\cdots $\\n\\nDenominator: $ 1 + (1+x)^{10} = 1 + 1 + 10x + 45x^2 + \\\\cdots = 2 + 10x + 45x^2 + \\\\cdots $\\n\\nSo the fraction:\\n$ \\\\frac{ -10x - 45x^2 - 120x^3 - \\\\cdots }{ 2 + 10x + 45x^2 + \\\\cdots } $\\n\\nFactor out x from numerator:\\n= $ \\\\frac{ x (-10 - 45x - 120x^2 - \\\\cdots) }{ 2 + 10x + 45x^2 + \\\\cdots } $\\n\\nSo:\\nf(x) = x^p * [that] = x^p * x * \\\\frac{ -10 - 45x - \\\\cdots }{ 2 + 10x + \\\\cdots } = x^{p+1} \\\\cdot g(x)\\nwhere $ g(x) = \\\\frac{ -10 - 45x - \\\\cdots }{ 2 + 10x + \\\\cdots } $\\n\\nAs $ x \\\\to 0 $, $ g(x) \\\\to \\\\frac{-10}{2} = -5 $\\n\\nSo $ f(x) \\\\sim x^{p+1} \\\\cdot (-5) $\\n\\nWe want $ f(x) $ to approach a constant c (since bounded within 0.1 of c for very small x), so we need the exponent of x to be zero, otherwise:\\n- If $ p+1 > 0 $, then $ x^{p+1} \\\\to 0 $, so $ f(x) \\\\to 0 $, so c would have to be 0, but c ≠ 0.\\n- If $ p+1 < 0 $, then $ x^{p+1} \\\\to \\\\infty $, so |f(x)| → ∞, cannot be bounded near a constant.\\n- Therefore, we must have $ p+1 = 0 $ ⇒ $ p = -1 $\\n\\nThen $ f(x) = x^{-1} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{1 + (1+x)^{10}} $\\n\\nAnd as $ x \\\\to 0 $, this tends to $ \\\\lim_{x\\\\to0} \\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{x (1 + (1+x)^{10})} $\\n\\nBut from above, we have:\\nf(x) = x^{0} * g(x) = g(x) → -5\\n\\nMore precisely:\\n$ \\\\lim_{x\\\\to0} f(x) = \\\\lim_{x\\\\to0} \\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{x (1 + (1+x)^{10})} $\\n\\nNumerator: $ 1 - (1+x)^{10} \\\\sim -10x $\\nDenominator: $ x (1 + (1+x)^{10}) \\\\sim x (1+1) = 2x $\\nSo ratio: $ \\\\frac{-10x}{2x} = -5 $\\n\\nTo be precise, let’s compute the limit:\\n$ \\\\lim_{x\\\\to0} \\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{x (1 + (1+x)^{10})} = \\\\frac{ \\\\lim_{x\\\\to0} \\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{x} }{ \\\\lim_{x\\\\to0} (1 + (1+x)^{10}) } $\\n\\nNumerator limit: derivative of $ (1+x)^{10} $ at 0 is 10, so $ \\\\frac{d}{dx}[1 - (1+x)^{10}]|_{x=0} = -10 $, so limit is -10.\\nDenominator: $ \\\\lim_{x\\\\to0} (1 + (1+x)^{10}) = 1 + 1 = 2 $\\nBut denominator of the whole thing is $ x \\\\times (\\\\cdots) $, so we have:\\n$ \\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{x} \\\\to -10 $, and $ 1 + (1+x)^{10} \\\\to 2 $, so overall:\\n$ \\\\frac{ \\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{x} }{ 1 + (1+x)^{10} } \\\\to \\\\frac{-10}{2} = -5 $\\n\\nSo $ \\\\lim_{x\\\\to0^+} f(x) = -5 $\\n\\nTherefore, for small x, $ f(x) $ is close to -5.\\n\\nNow, we need $ c - 0.1 < f(x) < c + 0.1 $ for all $ 0 < x < 10^{-100} $\\n\\nSince $ f(x) \\\\to -5 $, for sufficiently small x, $ |f(x) + 5| < 0.1 $, so it lies in (-5.1, -4.9)\\n\\nSo c must be -5.\\n\\nc is a nonzero integer: -5 ≠ 0, good.\\n\\nIs this uniform for all $ x < 10^{-100} $? Yes, because the convergence is smooth, and higher-order terms become negligible.\\n\\nLet’s verify with expansion.\\nWe had:\\nf(x) = $ x^{-1} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{ -10x -45x^2 -120x^3 - \\\\cdots }{ 2 + 10x + 45x^2 + \\\\cdots } = \\\\frac{ -10 -45x -120x^2 - \\\\cdots }{ 2 + 10x + 45x^2 + \\\\cdots } $\\n\\nSet $ h(x) = \\\\frac{ -10 -45x -120x^2 - \\\\cdots }{ 2 + 10x + 45x^2 + \\\\cdots } $\\n\\nAs $ x \\\\to 0 $, $ h(x) \\\\to -5 $\\n\\nCan we write $ h(x) = -5 + O(x) $? Let’s see:\\nLet’s divide:\\nNumerator: -10 -45x + O(x^2)\\nDenominator: 2 + 10x + O(x^2)\\nSo:\\nh(x) = [ -10 -45x ] / [ 2 + 10x ] + O(x^2) = (-10(1 + 4.5x)) / (2(1 + 5x)) + O(x^2) = -5 (1 + 4.5x) / (1 + 5x) + O(x^2)\\n\\nNow $ \\\\frac{1 + 4.5x}{1 + 5x} = (1 + 4.5x)(1 - 5x + 25x^2 - \\\\cdots) = 1 + 4.5x - 5x + O(x^2) = 1 - 0.5x + O(x^2) $\\n\\nSo h(x) = -5 [1 - 0.5x + O(x^2)] + O(x^2) = -5 + 2.5x + O(x^2)\\n\\nSo $ f(x) = -5 + 2.5x + O(x^2) $\\n\\nFor $ 0 < x < 10^{-100} $, the term $ 2.5x < 2.5 \\\\times 10^{-100} $, which is much less than 0.1, so indeed $ |f(x) + 5| < 0.1 $ for such small x.\\n\\nIn fact, it’s extremely close to -5.\\n\\nTherefore, c = -5, p = -1.\\n\\nSo ordered pair (p, c) = (-1, -5)\\n\\nFinal answer.\\n\\nSummary:\\nProblem 1: 100a + b = 100*1 + 16 = 116\\nProblem 2: (p, c) = (-1, -5)\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"116\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(-1, -5)\"\n}",
