An ant begins at the left end and every minute does two things in sequence:\\n1. Walks 1 inch to the right along the current length of the band.\\n2. The entire rubber band is then uniformly stretched by 1 inch (i.e., its length increases by 1 inch, and all points on the band, including the ant's position, are scaled proportionally).\\n\\nWe are to find the smallest integer n such that during the nth minute, the ant reaches the right end.\\n\\nLet’s define:\\n- L_n: the length of the rubber band at the beginning of minute n\\n- P_n: the position of the ant at the beginning of minute n (before walking)\\n\\nInitially (at the start of minute 1):\\n- L_1 = 4\\n- P_1 = 0\\n\\nEach minute proceeds as:\\n1. Ant walks 1 inch to the right: new position = P_n + 1\\n2. If this new position >= L_n, then the ant has reached the end during this minute — we’re done.\\n3. Otherwise, the band is stretched by 1 inch. Since stretching is uniform, the new length becomes L_{n+1} = L_n + 1, and the ant’s position is scaled by the factor (L_n + 1)/L_n.\\n   So: P_{n+1} = (P_n + 1) * (L_n + 1)/L_n\\n\\nBut note: after stretching, the length becomes L_{n+1} = L_n + 1.\\n\\nSo let’s simulate step by step.\\n\\nMinute 1:\\n- Start: L = 4, P = 0\\n- Ant walks: P = 1\\n- Compare: 1 < 4 → not yet reached\\n- Stretch: new length = 5\\n- Scale position: P_new = 1 * (5/4) = 1.25\\n- So after minute 1: P = 1.25, L = 5\\n\\nMinute 2:\\n- Walk: 1.25 + 1 = 2.25\\n- Compare with L = 5: 2.25 < 5 → not reached\\n- Stretch to 6: scale factor = 6/5 = 1.2\\n- New position: 2.25 * 1.2 = 2.7\\n- L = 6\\n\\nMinute 3:\\n- Walk: 2.7 + 1 = 3.7\\n- Compare with 6: 3.7 < 6 → no\\n- Stretch to 7: scale factor = 7/6 ≈ 1.1667\\n- New pos: 3.7 * (7/6) = (37/10)*(7/6) = 259/60 ≈ 4.3167\\n- L = 7\\n\\nMinute 4:\\n- Walk: 4.3167 + 1 = 5.3167\\n- Compare with 7: still less\\n- Stretch to 8: scale factor 8/7\\n- New pos: 5.3167 * (8/7) ≈ (259/60 + 1) = 319/60; wait, better to track fractions.\\n\\nLet’s restart with exact fractions.\\n\\nDefine:\\nP_1 = 0, L_1 = 4\\n\\nAfter each minute:\\n- After walk: P_walk = P_n + 1\\n- If P_walk >= L_n → ant finishes during minute n\\n- Else: P_{n+1} = (P_n + 1) * (L_n + 1)/L_n\\n          L_{n+1} = L_n + 1\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nn=1:\\nP_walk = 0 + 1 = 1\\n1 < 4 → continue\\nP_2 = 1 * (5/4) = 5/4 = 1.25\\nL_2 = 5\\n\\nn=2:\\nP_walk = 5/4 + 1 = 9/4 = 2.25\\n2.25 < 5 → continue\\nP_3 = (9/4) * (6/5) = (9*6)/(4*5) = 54/20 = 27/10 = 2.7\\nL_3 = 6\\n\\nn=3:\\nP_walk = 27/10 + 1 = 37/10 = 3.7\\n3.7 < 6 → continue\\nP_4 = (37/10) * (7/6) = (37*7)/(10*6) = 259/60 ≈ 4.3167\\nL_4 = 7\\n\\nn=4:\\nP_walk = 259/60 + 1 = 319/60 ≈ 5.3167\\n5.3167 < 7 → continue\\nP_5 = (319/60) * (8/7) = (319*8)/(60*7) = 2552 / 420\\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 4: 638 / 105 ≈ 6.0762\\nL_5 = 8\\n\\nn=5:\\nP_walk = 638/105 + 1 = 638/105 + 105/105 = 743/105 ≈ 7.076\\nNow compare with L_5 = 8 → 7.076 < 8 → not reached\\nStretch to L=9, scale factor 9/8\\nP_6 = (743/105) * (9/8) = (743 * 9) / (105 * 8) = 6687 / 840\\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 3: 2229 / 280 ≈ 7.9607\\nL_6 = 9\\n\\nn=6:\\nP_walk = 2229/280 + 1 = 2229/280 + 280/280 = 2509/280 ≈ 8.9607\\nCompare with L_6 = 9 → 8.9607 < 9 → not yet\\nStretch to 10: scale factor 10/9\\nP_7 = (2509/280) * (10/9) = (2509 * 10) / (280 * 9) = 25090 / 2520\\nSimplify: divide by 10: 2509 / 252 ≈ 9.956\\nL_7 = 10\\n\\nn=7:\\nP_walk = 2509/252 + 1 = 2509/252 + 252/252 = 2761/252 ≈ 10.956\\nCompare with L_7 = 10 → 10.956 > 10 → YES! During minute 7, the ant reaches the end.\\n\\nSo answer is n = 7.\\n\\nBut wait: we need to confirm whether it reaches during the 7th minute.\\nAt the start of minute 7: position = ~9.956, length = 10\\nAnt walks 1 inch: new position = 9.956 + 1 = 10.956 > 10 → yes, during the walking phase of minute 7, it passes the end.\\nSince the end is at 10, and it moves from ~9.956 to ~10.956, it must cross 10 during that minute.\\nSo n = 7.\\n\\nAlternatively, we can model the fractional progress.\\nAnother way: let f_n be the fraction of the way along the band at the start of minute n.\\nBut our simulation seems correct.\\n\\nWait: let's double-check minute 6:\\nAt start of minute 6: P = 2229/280 ≈ 7.9607, L=9\\nWalk: +1 → 8.9607 < 9 → so doesn’t finish during walk\\nThen stretch: new length 10? No: after minute 6, length becomes 10? Wait:\\nL_n is length at start of minute n.\\nL_1 = 4\\nL_2 = 5\\n...\\nL_6 = 9\\nAfter walking and before stretching: length still 9\\nAfter stretching: L becomes 10, so L_7 = 10\\nYes.\\nThen minute 7: start with P ≈ 9.956, L=10\\nWalk 1 inch: reaches ~10.956 > 10 → crosses the end during minute 7.\\nSo answer is 7.\\n\\nBut let me check online or known problem: this is a classic ant on a rubber rope.\\nIn the classic problem, the ant eventually reaches the end because the harmonic series diverges.\\nThe position after walking but before stretching in minute n is compared to L_n.\\n\\nThe key is: at the beginning of minute n, length is 3 + n (since starts at 4, increases by 1 per minute: after k stretches, length = 4 + (k-1)? Wait.\\nAt start of minute 1: length = 4 = 3 + 1\\nMinute 2: 5 = 3 + 2\\nMinute n: L_n = 3 + n\\nYes: L_n = n + 3\\n\\nNow, let’s define p_n as position at start of minute n.\\np_1 = 0\\nAfter walking: p_n + 1\\nIf p_n + 1 >= L_n = n + 3 → done\\nElse: p_{n+1} = (p_n + 1) * (L_n + 1)/L_n = (p_n + 1) * (n + 4)/(n + 3)\\n\\nSo recurrence:\\np_{n+1} = (p_n + 1) * (n + 4)/(n + 3)\\n\\nWe can write:\\np_2 = (0 + 1) * 5/4 = 5/4\\np_3 = (5/4 + 1) * 6/5 = (9/4)*(6/5) = 54/20 = 27/10\\np_4 = (27/10 + 1) * 7/6 = (37/10)*(7/6) = 259/60\\np_5 = (259/60 + 1) * 8/7 = (319/60)*(8/7) = 2552/420 = 638/105\\np_6 = (638/105 + 1) * 9/8 = (743/105)*(9/8) = 6687/840 = 2229/280\\np_7 = (2229/280 + 1) * 10/9 = (2509/280)*(10/9) = 25090/2520 = 2509/252 ≈ 9.956\\nNow, at start of minute 7: p_7 ≈ 9.956, L_7 = 7 + 3 = 10\\nAnt walks 1 inch: new position = 9.956 + 1 = 10.956 > 10 → so during minute 7, it reaches the end.\\nThus, n = 7.\\n\\nSo Problem 1 answer is 7.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nSix students sit in a row: positions 1 to 6, with aisles on both sides. So a student at position 1 can exit left without passing anyone, position 6 can exit right without passing anyone. A student in the middle must pass others unless they leave when the aisle is clear.\\n\\nThey finish at random times — assume all 6! orders of finishing are equally likely.\\n\\nA student will have to \\\"pass by\\\" another student if, when they get up to leave, there is someone between them and an aisle who hasn't left yet.\\n\\nBut since they can choose to go to either aisle? Wait — the problem says \\\"to get to an aisle\\\", and aisles are only on the two sides. So a student can choose to exit left or right, whichever is shorter or easier?\\nBut typically in such problems, we assume that a student can exit via either aisle, and will do so without passing someone only if all students between them and at least one aisle have already left.\\n\\nSo a student does NOT need to pass anyone if either:\\n- All students to their left (toward left aisle) have already left, OR\\n- All students to their right (toward right aisle) have already left.\\n\\nOtherwise, whichever way they go, someone is in the way.\\n\\nThe event we care about is: \\\"some student will have to pass by another student to get to an aisle\\\"\\nThat is, at the moment they leave, for every aisle, there is a student between them and that aisle who hasn't left yet.\\n\\nSo the complement is: every student, when they leave, can exit without passing someone — i.e., for each student, at their departure time, either all to the left or all to the right have already left.\\n\\nBut actually, no: the question is about whether *some* student will have to pass by another. We want the probability that this happens to at least one student.\\n\\nIt might be easier to compute the complementary probability: that no student has to pass another — i.e., every student, when they leave, can exit via at least one side without passing anyone.\\n\\nSo we want P(no student is blocked on both sides when they leave) = ?\\nAnd then subtract from 1.\\n\\nThis is a known type of problem.\\n\\nLet the seats be 1,2,3,4,5,6 from left to right.\\nA student in seat i, when they leave, can exit left without passing anyone if all students in seats 1 to i-1 have already left.\\nSimilarly, can exit right if all in i+1 to 6 have already left.\\n\\nSo student i is blocked on both sides if, at their departure time, there is at least one student to their left who hasn't left, AND at least one to their right who hasn't left.\\n\\nBut “hasn't left” means finished after them.\\n\\nSo for student i, they are forced to pass someone iff among the other 5 students, at least one to the left and one to the right finish after them.\\n\\nBut we need the probability that *for some student*, this happens.\\n\\nThis seems messy due to dependence.\\n\\nAlternative approach: consider the order of departure.\\n\\nKnown result: in a line of n people, the probability that no one is blocked (i.e., everyone can exit without passing) is related to the number of ways the departure order allows this.\\n\\nActually, a key insight: a student can exit without passing anyone iff they are either the first to leave among all from 1 to i, or the first among all from i to 6? Not quite.\\n\\nWait: student i can exit left without passing if all to the left have already left — i.e., student i is later than all of 1 to i-1.\\nSimilarly, can exit right if later than all of i+1 to 6.\\n\\nSo student i does NOT need to pass anyone iff they are not the last among {1,2,...,i} in the departure order? No.\\n\\nTo exit left: all j < i must have left before i → i is after all j < i.\\nTo exit right: i is after all j > i.\\n\\nSo student i can exit without passing iff i is after all on the left OR after all on the right.\\n\\nEquivalently, i is not the first among the left group plus i, and not the first among the right group plus i? Let's think differently.\\n\\nStudent i is blocked on both sides iff there exists j < i who leaves after i, and k > i who leaves after i.\\nI.e., i is not the last among {1,2,...,i}, and not the last among {i,i+1,...,6}.\\nNo: if there is j < i who leaves after i, then i is not after all left — so cannot exit left.\\nSimilarly, if there is k > i who leaves after i, cannot exit right.\\nSo blocked iff (not after all left) AND (not after all right)\\ni.e., (there exists j < i with departure(j) > departure(i)) AND (there exists k > i with departure(k) > departure(i))\\n\\nSo student i is blocked iff in the departure order, i is not the maximum among 1..i, and not the maximum among i..6? No.\\n“after” means higher departure time, i.e., later.\\nLet T(i) be the departure time of i, lower T means earlier.\\nBetter to use rank: let π(i) be the position in departure order, π(i)=1 means first to leave, π(i)=6 means last.\\nThen student i can exit left iff for all j < i, π(j) < π(i) → i leaves after all to the left.\\nSimilarly, can exit right iff for all j > i, π(j) < π(i) → i leaves after all to the right.\\nSo student i is blocked iff π(i) < π(j) for some j < i, AND π(i) < π(k) for some k > i.\\nI.e., there is someone to the left who leaves later, and someone to the right who leaves later.\\nEquivalently, i is not the last (in departure order) among {1,2,...,i}, and not the last among {i,i+1,...,6}.\\n“Last” means highest π value.\\nSo let M_left(i) = max{ π(j) | j <= i }\\nM_right(i) = max{ π(j) | j >= i }\\nThen student i can exit without passing iff π(i) = M_left(i) or π(i) = M_right(i)\\nBlocked iff π(i) < M_left(i) and π(i) < M_right(i)\\n\\nWe want P( for some i, π(i) < M_left(i) and π(i) < M_right(i) )\\n\\nComplement: P( for all i, π(i) = M_left(i) or π(i) = M_right(i) )\\n\\nWhat permutations satisfy that for every i, i is either the last (latest) among 1..i, or the last among i..6?\\nNote: being last among 1..i means π(i) = max_{j<=i} π(j), i.e., i is a record high (maximum so far) from the left? No: if π(i) is the maximum of π(1) to π(i), that means i has the latest departure time so far — so it's a record in terms of maximum.\\nSimilarly, from the right.\\n\\nBut let's think: the condition for each i is that in the prefix 1..i, i has the maximum π value, or in the suffix i..6, i has the maximum π value.\\n\\nπ(i) is the departure order rank, say 1 to 6, with 6 being last.\\nSet σ(i) = π(i), so σ is a permutation of {1,2,3,4,5,6}, with larger values meaning later departure.\\nThen for each i, either:\\n- σ(i) = max{ σ(j) | j <= i }, or\\n- σ(i) = max{ σ(j) | j >= i }\\n\\nWe need the number of permutations where every position i satisfies that σ(i) is a prefix maximum (from left) or a suffix maximum (from right).\\n\\nThis is a known combinatorial object.\\n\\nNote: the global maximum, which is 6, must be at a position where it is both prefix and suffix max, so it satisfies.\\n\\nNow, suppose we consider the position of the last person to leave, i.e., σ(i)=6.\\nLet k be such that σ(k)=6.\\nThen for i=k, it is both prefix and suffix max, so ok.\\nFor i < k: the prefix max at i is at most σ(i), but since k>i and σ(k)=6>σ(i), so σ(i) < max_{j<=i} σ(j) only if the max is greater, but max_{j<=i} σ(j) <= max of first i, which may not include k, so could be less.\\nBut σ(i) is prefix max iff σ(i) >= σ(j) for all j<=i.\\nSimilarly for suffix.\\n\\nBut since σ(k)=6 is the largest, for any i < k, max_{j<=i} σ(j) <= 5 < 6, so σ(i) <=5, so if σ(i) is not the max of its prefix, but it might be.\\n\\nThe condition fails at i if σ(i) is not the prefix max and not the suffix max.\\n\\nThere is a known result: the permutations where every element is a prefix maximum or suffix maximum are exactly those that avoid the pattern where an element is not extreme in either direction.\\n\\nAlternatively, such permutations are called “permutations with no internal elements” or related to “zigzag” but perhaps not.\\n\\nI recall that in a line, the only way no one is blocked is if the departure order is such that people leave from the ends inward — like a palindrome or something.\\n\\nActually, a key insight: if a student is not at an end, and they leave before someone on both sides, they are blocked.\\nBut more importantly, consider that the set of people who can leave without being blocked at any time are only those at the current ends of the remaining interval.\\n\\nAh! This is crucial.\\n\\nAt any time, the only students who can exit without passing anyone are those who are currently at the end of the contiguous block of remaining students.\\nBecause if you're in the middle, both neighbors are still there (if the block is contiguous), so you can't exit without passing.\\nBut students may not be contiguous? No, initially they are in a row, and as people leave, the row may break into segments, but since they are in a straight line, when someone leaves, the row splits only if they are in the middle.\\nBut actually, the physical arrangement: students are in seats 1-6. When a student leaves, the seats are still there, but the “block” of occupied seats may become disconnected.\\nHowever, to exit to an aisle, a student only needs the path to the aisle to be clear.\\nSo if student 3 wants to exit left, they need students 1 and 2 to have left. It doesn't matter if student 4 or 5 or 6 are still there.\\nSimilarly, to exit right, needs 4,5,6 gone.\\nSo the connectivity doesn't matter; only the relative positions.\\nTherefore, a student can exit via left aisle iff all students to their left (lower indices) have already left, regardless of who is to the right.\\nSimilarly for right.\\nSo the state is just which students have left; the spatial contiguity isn't necessary.\\n\\nTherefore, at any time, the students who can leave without passing anyone are exactly those for whom all to the left have left (so they are the leftmost remaining), or all to the right have left (rightmost remaining).\\nBut “all to the left have left” means no one with smaller index remains, so they are the minimum index among remaining.\\nSimilarly, “all to the right have left” means no one with larger index remains, so they are the maximum index among remaining.\\nTherefore, at any time, the only students who can exit without passing anyone are the current leftmost and rightmost in the row among those still present.\\nThat is, the ones with the smallest and largest indices still seated.\\n\\nTherefore, in the departure process, at each step, only the two end students (of the current remaining set) can legally exit without passing someone.\\nAny other student, if they were to leave, would have someone on both sides still there (since not end), so would have to pass someone.\\nBut in this problem, students leave when they finish, in a fixed order, and we assume they can attempt to leave, but if they are not at an end, they must pass someone.\\nThe problem is asking for the probability that *some* student will have to pass by another — which will happen if at the time they leave, they are not one of the current end students (min or max index remaining).\\n\\nTherefore, the event that no student has to pass anyone is equivalent to: in the departure order, each student who leaves is at the time of their departure either the leftmost or rightmost among the remaining students.\\nThat is, the departure order is such that we always remove an end student.\\nThis is exactly the process of removing endpoints, and the set of such permutations is known as the “boundary” or “end-to-end” permutations.\\n\\nFor a line of n people, the number of ways to depart such that only ends are removed at each step is 2^{n-1}.\\nWhy? Because at each step except the last, you have a choice: remove left end or right end. But the last one has no choice.\\nHowever, this assumes that we are choosing who leaves next from the ends, but in this case, the departure order is fixed randomly, and we ask whether it coincides with some sequence of end removals.\\n\\nThe number of permutations that can be generated by repeatedly removing either end is 2^{n-1}.\\nFor example, n=2: possible orders: (1,2) or (2,1). Both are end removals: for (1,2): remove 1 (end), then 2. For (2,1): remove 2, then 1. So 2 = 2^{1}.\\nn=3: possible sequences:\\n- Remove left, left, left: 1,2,3\\n- Remove left, right, right: but after removing 1, remaining 2,3; remove right (3), then 2: order 1,3,2\\n- Remove right, right, right: 3,2,1\\n- Remove right, left, left: remove 3, then 1, then 2: order 3,1,2\\n- Remove left, then after 1 gone, remove left (2), then 3: 1,2,3 already have\\nCan we get 2,1,3? To remove 2 first: but 2 is not an end initially (ends are 1 and 3), so cannot remove 2 first. Similarly, 2,3,1: cannot remove 2 first.\\n1,3,2: yes, as above.\\n3,1,2: yes.\\nWhat about 1,2,3; 1,3,2; 3,2,1; 3,1,2; also 2,1,3? No, cannot remove 2 first.\\nIs 2,3,1 possible? No.\\nWhat about removing left, then right: 1, then 3, then 2: order 1,3,2\\nOr right, then left: 3,1,2\\nOr left, left: 1,2,3\\nOr right, right: 3,2,1\\nCan we remove left, then left: 1,2,3\\nAfter removing 1, remaining 2,3; ends are 2 and 3; remove 2 (left), then 3.\\nSimilarly, remove 3 first, then 2, then 1: 3,2,1\\nRemove 1, then 3, then 2: 1,3,2\\nRemove 3, then 1, then 2: 3,1,2\\nCan we get 2,1,3? Only if we remove 2 first, but 2 is not an end, so no.\\nSimilarly, 2,3,1: no.\\nAlso, 1,2,3; 3,2,1; 1,3,2; 3,1,2 — that's 4.\\nIs there more? What if we remove 1, then 2, then 3: same as 1,2,3\\nOr 3, then 2, then 1: 3,2,1\\nOr 1, then 3, then 2: 1,3,2\\nOr 3, then 1, then 2: 3,1,2\\nCan we remove 2 at some point? Only when it becomes an end, i.e., when one neighbor is gone.\\nBut initially, to remove 2, it must not be an end, so cannot be first.\\nSuppose we want 1,2,3: remove 1 (end), now 2,3; 2 is left end, remove 2, then 3.\\nSimilarly, 3,2,1: remove 3, then 2, then 1.\\n1,3,2: remove 1, then 3 (now 2,3 remain, 3 is right end), remove 3, then 2.\\n3,1,2: remove 3, then 1 (remaining 1,2; 1 is left end), remove 1, then 2.\\nNow, can we get 2,1,3? To remove 2 first: impossible.\\nWhat about 1,2,3; etc.\\nAnother one: can we remove 2 after one end? Yes, but not first.\\nIs there a sequence like 1,2,3; 1,3,2; 2,1,3? No.\\nTotal 4 = 2^{3-1} = 4.\\nYes.\\nFor n=1: 1 = 2^0\\nn=2: 2 = 2^1\\nn=3: 4 = 2^2\\nSo for n, number of such permutations is 2^{n-1}.\\n\\nEach such permutation corresponds to a sequence of choices: at each step, choose to remove left or right end, but when only one left, no choice.\\nThere are n-1 steps where you choose (since first n-1 removals have at least two people, so two choices if both ends available, but when the remaining are contiguous, there are always two ends until the last.\\nAnd at each removal except the last, you choose left or right end to remove.\\nSo 2^{n-1} possible sequences.\\nAnd each gives a unique permutation.\\nFor example n=3: sequences:\\n- L,L: remove 1, then 2, then 3: order 1,2,3\\n- L,R: remove 1, then 3, then 2: order 1,3,2\\n- R,L: remove 3, then 1, then 2: order 3,1,2\\n- R,R: remove 3, then 2, then 1: order 3,2,1\\nAll covered.\\nAnd no others.\\nSo total favorable permutations where no one has to pass anyone: 2^{n-1}\\nTotal possible: n!\\nSo probability that no one has to pass: 2^{n-1} / n!\\nThen probability that some student has to pass: 1 - 2^{n-1} / n!\\n\\nHere n=6.\\nSo number of good permutations: 2^{5} = 32\\nTotal permutations: 6! = 720\\nSo P(no one blocked) = 32 / 720 = 32 ÷ 16 = 2, 720 ÷ 16 = 45? Wait.\\n32 / 720 = 16 / 360 = 8 / 180 = 4 / 90 = 2 / 45\\nSo P(someone blocked) = 1 - 2/45 = 43/45\\n\\nIs that possible? 43/45 is about 0.955, very high.\\nBut intuitively, for 6 people, it's very likely that someone in the middle leaves before the ends, so yes.\\nOnly in very specific orders (like peeling off ends) does no one have to pass.\\nThere are only 32 such orders out of 720, so yes, rare.\\nSo probability is 1 - 32/720 = 1 - 4/90 = 1 - 2/45 = 43/45\\nSimplify 32/720: divide numerator and denominator by 16: 32÷16=2, 720÷16=45? 16*45=720? 16*45=720 yes, 16*2=32, so 2/45.\\nYes.\\nSo P = 1 - 2/45 = 43/45\\n\\nBut is this correct?\\nIn the process, when we remove an end, the person leaving is indeed able to exit without passing, since they are at an end.\\nAnd if a permutation is not of this form, then at some point, a non-end person leaves, and at that time, since they are not min or max index remaining, there is someone to their left still there and someone to their right still there, so whichever way they go, they have to pass someone.\\nMoreover, when they leave, the people between them and the aisle are still there, so yes, they must pass by someone.\\nTherefore, the condition is necessary and sufficient.\\nHence, for n=6, P(some student has to pass) = 1 - 2^{5}/6! = 1 - 32/720 = 1 - 4/90 = 1 - 2/45 = 43/45\\n\\nSo answer is 43/45.\\n\\nBut let me confirm with small n.\\nSay n=2: students A,B in seats 1,2.\\nPossible orders:\\n1. A then B: A leaves first. At that time, B is still there, but A is at left end, so can exit left without passing. Then B leaves, can exit right. So no one passes.\\n2. B then A: B leaves first, is at right end, exits right. Then A exits left. No one passes.\\nSo in both cases, no one has to pass. Probability 1.\\nAccording to formula: P(someone passes) = 1 - 2^{1}/2! = 1 - 2/2 = 1-1=0. Correct.\\n\\nn=3: total perm 6.\\nGood permutations: 2^{2}=4: as listed: 1,2,3; 1,3,2; 3,2,1; 3,1,2\\nNow, the bad ones: 2,1,3 and 2,3,1\\nTake 2,1,3: student 2 leaves first. At that time, students 1 and 3 are still there. Student 2 is in middle. To exit left, needs 1 to be gone, but 1 is still there. To exit right, needs 3 gone, but 3 is there. So must pass someone. Indeed, whichever way, passes 1 or 3.\\nSimilarly, in 2,3,1: 2 leaves first, same issue.\\nSo in these two cases, the first leaver (student 2) has to pass someone.\\nSo P(someone passes) = 2/6 = 1/3\\nFormula: 1 - 4/6 = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. Correct.\\n\\nSo for n=6, P = 1 - 2^{5}/6! = 1 - 32/720 = (720 - 32)/720 = 688/720\\nBut simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 16: 688÷16=43, 720÷16=45? 16*43=688? 16*40=640, 16*3=48, total 688 yes. 16*45=720. So 43/45.\\nYes.\\nSo answer is 43/45.\\n\\nTherefore:\\nProblem 1: 7\\nProblem 2: 43/45\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"7\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"43/45\"\n}",
