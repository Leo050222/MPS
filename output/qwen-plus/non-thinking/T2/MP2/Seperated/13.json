Then the length is 3w.\\n\\nPerimeter P = 2(length + width) = 2(3w + w) = 2(4w) = 8w.\\n\\nArea A = length × width = 3w × w = 3w².\\n\\nWe are told that perimeter and area are numerically equal to k, so:\\n\\n8w = 3w² = k\\n\\nSet 8w = 3w²:\\n\\n3w² - 8w = 0\\nw(3w - 8) = 0\\n\\nSo w = 0 or w = 8/3. Since w > 0, we take w = 8/3.\\n\\nThen k = 8w = 8 × (8/3) = 64/3.\\n\\nCheck area: 3w² = 3 × (64/9) = 192/9 = 64/3. Matches.\\n\\nSo k = 64/3.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nLet the ladder have length L (constant).\\n\\nInitially:\\n- Bottom is 15 ft from house → base = 15\\n- Height on wall = h\\nThen by Pythagoras: L² = 15² + h² → L² = 225 + h²\\n\\nAfter moving:\\n- Bottom is 15 + 9 = 24 ft from house\\n- Top slides down 13 ft → new height = h - 13\\nThen: L² = 24² + (h - 13)² = 576 + (h - 13)²\\n\\nSet both expressions for L² equal:\\n\\n225 + h² = 576 + (h - 13)²\\n\\nExpand right side:\\n(h - 13)² = h² - 26h + 169\\nSo:\\n225 + h² = 576 + h² - 26h + 169\\n\\nSubtract h² from both sides:\\n225 = 576 - 26h + 169\\n225 = 745 - 26h\\n\\nNow solve:\\n26h = 745 - 225 = 520\\nh = 520 / 26 = 20\\n\\nNow find L:\\nL² = 15² + h² = 225 + 400 = 625\\nL = √625 = 25\\n\\nSo the ladder is 25 feet long.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"64/3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"25\"\n}",
