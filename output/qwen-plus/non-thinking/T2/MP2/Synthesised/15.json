Instead of finding the maximum possible value of $x + y^2 + z^3$, simply find $k = z + 1/2$, where $z$ is the value of the variable with the cubic term in the non-negative real numbers $x, y, z$ satisfying $x + y + z = 1$ that achieve this maximum. Indecisive Andy starts out at the midpoint of the 1-unit-long segment $\\overline{H T}$. He flips 2010 coins. On each flip, if the coin is heads, he moves halfway towards endpoint $H$, and if the coin is tails, he moves halfway towards endpoint $T$. After his 2010 moves, what is the expected distance between Andy and the point on $\\overline{H T}$ that is a distance $k$ from $H$?",

Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Part 1: Maximize $ x + y^2 + z^3 $**\\n\\nWe are told that $ x, y, z \\\\geq 0 $ and $ x + y + z = 1 $. We want to maximize:\\n\\n$$\\nx + y^2 + z^3\\n$$\\n\\nSince $ x = 1 - y - z $, substitute into the expression:\\n\\n$$\\nx + y^2 + z^3 = (1 - y - z) + y^2 + z^3 = 1 - y - z + y^2 + z^3\\n$$\\n\\nSo we define:\\n\\n$$\\nf(y, z) = 1 - y - z + y^2 + z^3\\n$$\\n\\nwith $ y \\\\geq 0 $, $ z \\\\geq 0 $, $ y + z \\\\leq 1 $.\\n\\nWe aim to maximize $ f(y,z) $ over this domain.\\n\\nLet’s analyze critical points and boundaries.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step 1: Try boundary cases**\\n\\nSince the function is not symmetric and higher powers favor larger values when variables are less than 1, we suspect the maximum occurs at some boundary.\\n\\nTry fixing one variable at 0.\\n\\n**Case 1: $ x = 0 $** → $ y + z = 1 $\\n\\nThen $ x + y^2 + z^3 = y^2 + z^3 = (1 - z)^2 + z^3 = 1 - 2z + z^2 + z^3 $\\n\\nDefine:\\n\\n$$\\ng(z) = 1 - 2z + z^2 + z^3, \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq z \\\\leq 1\\n$$\\n\\nTake derivative:\\n\\n$$\\ng'(z) = -2 + 2z + 3z^2\\n$$\\n\\nSet to zero:\\n\\n$$\\n3z^2 + 2z - 2 = 0\\n\\\\Rightarrow z = \\\\frac{ -2 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{4 + 24} }{6} = \\\\frac{ -2 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{28} }{6} = \\\\frac{ -2 \\\\pm 2\\\\sqrt{7} }{6} = \\\\frac{ -1 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{7} }{3}\\n$$\\n\\nOnly positive root in [0,1]:\\n\\n$ \\\\sqrt{7} \\\\approx 2.645 $, so $ z \\\\approx \\\\frac{-1 + 2.645}{3} \\\\approx \\\\frac{1.645}{3} \\\\approx 0.548 $\\n\\nCheck value at endpoints and critical point:\\n\\n- $ z = 0 $: $ g(0) = 1 $\\n- $ z = 1 $: $ g(1) = 1 - 2 + 1 + 1 = 1 $\\n- $ z \\\\approx 0.548 $: compute $ g(z) $\\n\\nBut let’s check another case.\\n\\n**Case 2: $ y = 0 $** → $ x + z = 1 $\\n\\nThen $ x + y^2 + z^3 = x + 0 + z^3 = (1 - z) + z^3 = 1 - z + z^3 $\\n\\nLet $ h(z) = 1 - z + z^3 $, $ z \\\\in [0,1] $\\n\\n$ h'(z) = -1 + 3z^2 $, set to zero: $ z^2 = 1/3 \\\\Rightarrow z = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\approx 0.577 $\\n\\n$ h(1/\\\\sqrt{3}) = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\right)^3 = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} + \\\\frac{1}{3\\\\sqrt{3}} = 1 - \\\\frac{2}{3\\\\sqrt{3}} $\\n\\nCompute numerically:\\n\\n$ \\\\frac{2}{3\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\approx \\\\frac{2}{5.196} \\\\approx 0.385 $, so $ h \\\\approx 1 - 0.385 = 0.615 $? Wait — no:\\n\\nWait: $ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\approx 0.577 $, $ \\\\frac{1}{3\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\approx 0.192 $\\n\\nSo $ h = 1 - 0.577 + 0.192 = 0.615 $\\n\\nBut earlier in Case 1 at $ z=0 $ or $ z=1 $, we got 1.\\n\\nWait — at $ z=0 $, $ y=1 $, $ x=0 $: then $ x+y^2+z^3 = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 $\\n\\nAt $ z=1 $, $ y=0 $, $ x=0 $: $ 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 $\\n\\nSo both give 1.\\n\\nBut can we get more than 1?\\n\\nWait: $ x + y^2 + z^3 \\\\leq x + y + z = 1 $? No! Because $ y^2 \\\\leq y $ only if $ y \\\\leq 1 $, which it is, but $ y^2 \\\\leq y $ for $ y \\\\in [0,1] $, so $ y^2 \\\\leq y $, and $ z^3 \\\\leq z $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nx + y^2 + z^3 \\\\leq x + y + z = 1\\n$$\\n\\nEquality when $ y^2 = y $ and $ z^3 = z $ → $ y = 0 $ or 1, $ z = 0 $ or 1.\\n\\nBut $ y=1 \\\\Rightarrow z=0 $, then $ x=0 $: value = 1\\n\\n$ z=1 \\\\Rightarrow y=0, x=0 $: value = 1\\n\\n$ y=0, z=0 \\\\Rightarrow x=1 $: value = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1\\n\\nSo in all corner cases, we get 1.\\n\\nBut wait — could we get more than 1? Suppose $ y=0.5 $, $ z=0 $, $ x=0.5 $: value = 0.5 + 0.25 + 0 = 0.75 < 1\\n\\nSuppose $ y=0 $, $ z=0.5 $, $ x=0.5 $: 0.5 + 0 + 0.125 = 0.625 < 1\\n\\nBut what if $ x=1 $, $ y=z=0 $: value = 1\\n\\nSo maximum is **1**, achieved when $ y=z=0 $, $ x=1 $, or $ x=0,y=1,z=0 $, or $ x=0,y=0,z=1 $.\\n\\nBut wait — is there a way to get more than 1?\\n\\nNo, because $ y^2 \\\\leq y $, $ z^3 \\\\leq z $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nx + y^2 + z^3 \\\\leq x + y + z = 1\\n$$\\n\\nSo maximum is 1.\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"find $ k = z + 1/2 $\\\", where $ z $ is the value of the variable with the cubic term **in the configuration that achieves the maximum**.\\n\\nNow, the maximum value 1 is achieved in multiple ways:\\n\\n1. $ x=1, y=0, z=0 $ → $ z=0 $\\n2. $ x=0, y=1, z=0 $ → $ z=0 $\\n3. $ x=0, y=0, z=1 $ → $ z=1 $\\n\\nIn case 3: $ x + y^2 + z^3 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 $, same as others.\\n\\nSo maximum is achieved when $ z=1 $, among other possibilities.\\n\\nBut the question says: \\\"where $ z $ is the value of the variable with the cubic term in the non-negative real numbers $ x, y, z $ satisfying $ x + y + z = 1 $ that achieve this maximum.\\\"\\n\\nIt doesn't say *all* such $ z $, but rather, we need to find $ k = z + 1/2 $ for the $ z $ that achieves the maximum. But multiple $ z $ achieve it.\\n\\nHowever, perhaps the maximum of $ x + y^2 + z^3 $ is actually greater than 1?\\n\\nWait — earlier inequality assumed $ y^2 \\\\leq y $, which is true, and $ z^3 \\\\leq z $, true, so sum $ \\\\leq x+y+z=1 $. So maximum is 1.\\n\\nBut is it possible to have $ x + y^2 + z^3 > 1 $? No, since $ y^2 \\\\leq y $, $ z^3 \\\\leq z $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nx + y^2 + z^3 \\\\leq x + y + z = 1\\n$$\\n\\nEquality iff $ y^2 = y $ and $ z^3 = z $, i.e., $ y=0 $ or 1, $ z=0 $ or 1.\\n\\nNow, with $ x+y+z=1 $, possibilities:\\n\\n- $ y=1, z=0 \\\\Rightarrow x=0 $\\n- $ y=0, z=1 \\\\Rightarrow x=0 $\\n- $ y=0, z=0 \\\\Rightarrow x=1 $\\n\\nAll give value 1.\\n\\nSo maximum is 1, achieved at these three points.\\n\\nNow, among these, the values of $ z $ are 0, 0, and 1.\\n\\nSo $ z $ can be 0 or 1.\\n\\nBut the problem says: \\\"find $ k = z + 1/2 $, where $ z $ is the value... that achieve this maximum.\\\"\\n\\nThis is ambiguous. But likely, they want the value of $ z $ that maximizes the expression, and perhaps in the case where $ z $ is as large as possible, since $ z^3 $ grows faster? But no, maximum is same.\\n\\nBut perhaps I made a mistake: maybe the maximum is **greater than 1**?\\n\\nWait — no: $ y^2 \\\\leq y $ for $ y \\\\in [0,1] $, equality at 0 or 1.\\nSame for $ z^3 \\\\leq z $, equality at 0 or 1.\\nSo indeed, $ x + y^2 + z^3 \\\\leq x + y + z = 1 $, so maximum is 1.\\n\\nBut now, the problem says: \\\"Instead of finding the maximum... simply find $ k = z + 1/2 $, where $ z $ is the value... that achieve this maximum.\\\"\\n\\nBut multiple $ z $: 0 or 1.\\n\\nBut perhaps they mean the value of $ z $ **when the maximum is achieved**, but maybe they imply a unique maximizing triple? It's not unique.\\n\\nWait — perhaps I miscalculated. Let me try $ z=1 $, $ x=y=0 $: value = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\\n\\nTry $ z=0.9 $, $ y=0.1 $, $ x=0 $: then $ x+y^2+z^3 = 0 + 0.01 + 0.729 = 0.739 < 1 $\\n\\nTry $ z=0.9 $, $ x=0.1 $, $ y=0 $: value = 0.1 + 0 + 0.729 = 0.829 < 1 $\\n\\nTry $ z=1 $, best.\\n\\nBut still, $ x=1 $ also gives 1.\\n\\nBut now, the next part involves Andy moving on a segment, and expected distance to a point $ k $ from H.\\n\\nPerhaps the intended maximum is not 1, or perhaps we need to maximize under the constraint, and maybe interior maximum?\\n\\nWait — let's suppose we fix $ z $, then $ x + y = 1 - z $\\n\\nThen $ x + y^2 + z^3 = (1 - z - y) + y^2 + z^3 = 1 - z - y + y^2 + z^3 $\\n\\nFor fixed $ z $, maximize over $ y \\\\in [0, 1-z] $:\\n\\n$ f(y) = y^2 - y + (1 - z + z^3) $\\n\\nThis is quadratic in $ y $: opens upwards, vertex at $ y = 1/2 $\\n\\nSo maximum on interval $ [0, 1-z] $ occurs at endpoint or at $ y=1/2 $ if in interval.\\n\\nBut since coefficient of $ y^2 $ is positive, minimum at vertex, so maximum at endpoints.\\n\\nThus for fixed $ z $, maximum over $ y $ occurs at $ y=0 $ or $ y=1-z $\\n\\n- If $ y=0 $, then $ x=1-z $, value = $ 1 - z + z^3 $\\n- If $ y=1-z $, then $ x=0 $, value = $ (1-z)^2 + z^3 = 1 - 2z + z^2 + z^3 $\\n\\nSo overall maximum is max over $ z \\\\in [0,1] $ of:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\max\\\\left( 1 - z + z^3,  1 - 2z + z^2 + z^3 \\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nDefine:\\n\\n$ A(z) = 1 - z + z^3 $\\n\\n$ B(z) = 1 - 2z + z^2 + z^3 $\\n\\nCompare $ A(z) $ and $ B(z) $:\\n\\n$ A(z) - B(z) = (1 - z + z^3) - (1 - 2z + z^2 + z^3) = -z + 2z - z^2 = z - z^2 = z(1 - z) \\\\geq 0 $\\n\\nSo $ A(z) \\\\geq B(z) $ for all $ z \\\\in [0,1] $, equality at 0,1.\\n\\nTherefore, for each $ z $, the better choice is $ y=0 $, giving value $ 1 - z + z^3 $\\n\\nSo now maximize $ f(z) = 1 - z + z^3 $ for $ z \\\\in [0,1] $\\n\\nTake derivative: $ f'(z) = -1 + 3z^2 $\\n\\nSet to zero: $ 3z^2 = 1 \\\\Rightarrow z^2 = 1/3 \\\\Rightarrow z = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\approx 0.577 $\\n\\nNow second derivative: $ f''(z) = 6z > 0 $ for $ z>0 $, so local minimum? Wait — $ f'(z) = -1 + 3z^2 $\\n\\n$ f''(z) = 6z $, at $ z=1/\\\\sqrt{3}>0 $, so concave up — local minimum!\\n\\nBut we are maximizing.\\n\\nSo maximum must occur at endpoint.\\n\\nCheck endpoints:\\n\\n- $ z=0 $: $ f(0) = 1 $\\n- $ z=1 $: $ f(1) = 1 -1 +1 = 1 $\\n\\nAnd at $ z=1/\\\\sqrt{3} \\\\approx 0.577 $: $ f(z) = 1 - 0.577 + (0.577)^3 \\\\approx 1 - 0.577 + 0.192 = 0.615 < 1 $\\n\\nSo maximum is 1, achieved at $ z=0 $ and $ z=1 $\\n\\nBut at $ z=1 $, $ y=0 $, $ x=0 $, value = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\\n\\nAt $ z=0 $, $ y=0 $, $ x=1 $, value = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1\\n\\nSo again, maximum is 1, achieved when $ z=0 $ or $ z=1 $\\n\\nBut the problem asks for $ k = z + 1/2 $, where $ z $ is the value in the triple that achieves the maximum.\\n\\nStill ambiguous.\\n\\nBut perhaps they intend the maximum to be achieved when $ z $ is chosen to maximize $ z^3 $, so $ z=1 $, then $ k = 1 + 1/2 = 1.5 $\\n\\nBut 1.5 is outside the segment [0,1], which might be an issue later.\\n\\nWait — the segment $ \\\\overline{HT} $ is 1-unit-long. So points on it are from 0 to 1.\\n\\nIf $ k $ is a point on the segment, it should be between 0 and 1.\\n\\nBut $ k = z + 1/2 $, $ z \\\\in [0,1] $, so $ k \\\\in [0.5, 1.5] $, but the segment is length 1, so if $ k>1 $, it's beyond T.\\n\\nBut the problem says: \\\"the point on $ \\\\overline{HT} $ that is a distance $ k $ from H\\\" — if $ k>1 $, this point is not on the segment.\\n\\nSo probably $ k \\\\leq 1 $, so $ z \\\\leq 0.5 $\\n\\nBut earlier, maximum is achieved at $ z=0 $ or $ z=1 $, so $ k=0.5 $ or $ 1.5 $\\n\\n1.5 is off the segment.\\n\\nPerhaps I misinterpreted.\\n\\nWait — reread: \\\"find $ k = z + 1/2 $, where $ z $ is the value of the variable with the cubic term ... that achieve this maximum.\\\"\\n\\nBut maybe the maximum is not 1, and my inequality is wrong.\\n\\nWait — $ x + y^2 + z^3 $, with $ x+y+z=1 $\\n\\nBut $ x = 1 - y - z $, so:\\n\\n$ f = 1 - y - z + y^2 + z^3 $\\n\\nNow, $ -y + y^2 = y^2 - y = y(y-1) \\\\leq 0 $ for $ y \\\\in [0,1] $\\n\\n$ -z + z^3 = z^3 - z = z(z^2 - 1) \\\\leq 0 $ for $ z \\\\in [0,1] $\\n\\nSo $ f = 1 + (y^2 - y) + (z^3 - z) \\\\leq 1 $\\n\\nEquality when both $ y^2 - y = 0 $ and $ z^3 - z = 0 $, i.e., $ y=0 $ or 1, $ z=0 $ or 1, and $ x+y+z=1 $\\n\\nAs before.\\n\\nSo maximum is 1.\\n\\nBut perhaps the problem is to minimize? No, it says maximum.\\n\\nAnother thought: perhaps \\\"instead of finding the maximum\\\" means that we don't need to find the maximum, but rather directly find $ k = z + 1/2 $ for the maximizing z.\\n\\nBut still, which z?\\n\\nPerhaps among the maximizers, we take the one with largest z, so z=1, k=1.5\\n\\nOr smallest, z=0, k=0.5\\n\\nBut let's look at the Andy part.\\n\\nAndy starts at midpoint of HT, so at 0.5.\\nHe flips 2010 coins.\\nOn heads, he moves halfway towards H.\\nOn tails, he moves halfway towards T.\\nH and T are endpoints of a 1-unit segment.\\nSay H is at 0, T is at 1. Then midpoint is 0.5.\\n\\nLet his position be p.\\nIf heads, new position = (p + 0)/2 = p/2\\nBecause halfway to H (0).\\nIf tails, new position = (p + 1)/2\\n\\nAfter 2010 moves, we want expected distance to the point at distance k from H, i.e., to point k (since H is at 0).\\n\\nSo E[ |final_position - k| ]\\n\\nBut the problem says: \\\"what is the expected distance between Andy and the point on $ \\\\overline{HT} $ that is a distance $ k $ from H?\\\"\\n\\nYes, so E[ |X - k| ] where X is final position.\\n\\nBut this depends on k.\\n\\nBut perhaps for the correct k, this expectation is simple.\\n\\nFirst, let's model Andy's position.\\n\\nLet P_0 = 0.5\\nAfter each flip:\\n- Heads (prob 1/2): P_{n} = P_{n-1} / 2\\n- Tails (prob 1/2): P_{n} = (P_{n-1} + 1)/2\\n\\nThis is a random process.\\n\\nLet me find the distribution or expected value.\\n\\nNote that this is a linear recurrence.\\n\\nLet me compute expected position after n steps.\\n\\nLet E_n = E[P_n]\\n\\nThen:\\n\\nE_n = (1/2) * E[ P_{n-1}/2 ] + (1/2) * E[ (P_{n-1} + 1)/2 ]\\n= (1/2)(1/2) E_{n-1} + (1/2)(1/2)(E_{n-1} + 1)\\n= (1/4) E_{n-1} + (1/4) E_{n-1} + 1/4\\n= (1/2) E_{n-1} + 1/4\\n\\nSo E_n = (1/2) E_{n-1} + 1/4\\n\\nWith E_0 = 0.5\\n\\nSolve this recurrence.\\n\\nHomogeneous solution: E_h = A (1/2)^n\\nParticular solution: constant, E_p = C, then C = (1/2)C + 1/4 => (1/2)C = 1/4 => C = 1/2\\nGeneral solution: E_n = A (1/2)^n + 1/2\\nInitial: n=0, E_0 = A + 1/2 = 0.5 => A = 0\\nSo E_n = 1/2 for all n\\n\\nExpected position is always 0.5\\n\\nBut we need expected absolute deviation, not variance.\\n\\nE[ |X - k| ] is not the same as |E[X] - k| unless k=0.5\\n\\nBut perhaps the final position has a known distribution.\\n\\nNotice that each move is a linear transformation.\\n\\nLet me think in terms of binary expansions or something.\\n\\nEach move: with prob 1/2, P <- P/2, with prob 1/2, P <- (P+1)/2\\n\\nThis is similar to a uniform distribution, but let's see the range.\\n\\nAfter n steps, the position can be written as a function of the sequence of moves.\\n\\nLet the moves be d_1, d_2, ..., d_n, where d_i = 0 for heads, 1 for tails.\\n\\nThen the final position can be computed recursively.\\n\\nP_0 = 0.5\\nP_1 = if d_1=0: P_0/2 = 0.25; if d_1=1: (P_0+1)/2 = 1.25/2 = 0.625\\nP_2: if d_2=0: P_1/2, if d_2=1: (P_1+1)/2\\n\\nThis seems messy.\\n\\nI recall that such processes can be represented as:\\n\\nP_n = \\\\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} + \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{d_i}{2^{n-i+1}} ? Let's see.\\n\\nActually, let's derive a closed form.\\n\\nNotice that the recurrence is affine.\\n\\nLet me write the recurrence as:\\n\\nP_n = \\\\begin{cases} \\n\\\\frac{1}{2} P_{n-1} & \\\\text{heads} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\frac{1}{2} P_{n-1} + \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\text{tails}\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n\\nSo in general, P_n = a_n P_0 + b_n, but with randomness.\\n\\nSince P_0 = 1/2, and the operations are linear.\\n\\nLet me define the transformation.\\n\\nLet T_0(x) = x/2\\nT_1(x) = (x+1)/2\\n\\nThen P_n = T_{d_n} \\\\circ T_{d_{n-1}} \\\\circ \\\\cdots \\\\circ T_{d_1} (P_0)\\n\\nBut P_0 = 1/2\\n\\nEach T_i is affine: T_0(x) = (1/2)x + 0, T_1(x) = (1/2)x + 1/2\\n\\nComposition of affine functions: (a x + b) composed with (c x + d) = a(c x + d) + b = (ac)x + (ad + b)\\n\\nSo the composition will be of the form A x + B, with A = (1/2)^n, since each multiplier is 1/2.\\n\\nThe constant term depends on the sequence.\\n\\nSpecifically, after n steps, P_n = (1/2)^n * P_0 + sum over i=1 to n of c_i * (1/2)^{n-i+1} where c_i is 0 or 1/2 depending on the move? Let's see.\\n\\nWhen we apply T_{d_i}, it's (1/2) * previous + b_i, where b_i = 0 if heads, 1/2 if tails.\\n\\nSo unfolding:\\n\\nP_n = (1/2)^n P_0 + sum_{k=1}^n (1/2)^{n-k+1} b_k\\n\\nBut b_k = 0 if d_k=0 (heads), 1/2 if d_k=1 (tails)\\n\\nSo b_k = (1/2) d_k, where d_k = 0 or 1\\n\\nThus:\\n\\nP_n = (1/2)^n * (1/2) + sum_{k=1}^n (1/2)^{n-k+1} * (1/2) d_k\\n= (1/2)^{n+1} + sum_{k=1}^n (1/2)^{n-k+2} d_k\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\nP_n = \\\\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} + \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\frac{d_k}{2^{n-k+2}}\\n\\nLet j = n-k+1, then when k=1, j=n, k=n, j=1\\n\\nBetter to reindex.\\n\\nLet i = n-k+1, then k = n-i+1, when k=1, i=n, k=n, i=1\\n\\n sum_{k=1}^n d_k / 2^{n-k+2} = sum_{i=1}^n d_{n-i+1} / 2^{i+1} \\n\\nNot helpful.\\n\\nNote that the sum is over k, and the exponent on 2 is n-k+2, so for k=n, term is d_n / 2^{2} = d_n / 4\\nFor k=n-1, d_{n-1} / 2^{3}, etc.\\n\\nSo P_n = \\\\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} + \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\frac{d_k}{2^{n-k+2}}\\n\\n= \\\\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} + \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\frac{d_k}{2^{n-k}}\\n\\nLet m = n-k, then sum_{m=0}^{n-1} \\\\frac{d_{n-m}}{2^{m}} \\n\\nSo P_n = \\\\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} + \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\sum_{m=0}^{n-1} \\\\frac{d_{n-m}}{2^{m}}\\n\\nThis is a bit messy.\\n\\nNotice that the sum \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\frac{d_k}{2^{n-k+2}} = \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\\\frac{d_{n-j}}{2^{j}} where j=n-k\\n\\nSo P_n = \\\\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} + \\\\frac{1}{4} S_n\\n where S_n = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\\\frac{d_{n-j}}{2^{j}} \\n\\nS_n is the number formed by the last n digits of the binary expansion, but in reverse order.\\n\\nActually, S_n = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{d_i}{2^{n-i}} \\n from earlier sum_{k=1}^n d_k / 2^{n-k} , which is exactly the number whose binary representation is d_1 d_2 ... d_n after the binary point.\\n\\nFor example, if d_1=1, d_2=0, d_3=1, then sum = 1/4 + 0/2 + 1/1 = wait no.\\n\\n sum_{k=1}^n d_k / 2^{n-k} : for k=1, d_1 / 2^{n-1}, k=2, d_2 / 2^{n-2}, ..., k=n, d_n / 2^0\\n\\nSo it's d_1 * 2^{-(n-1)} + d_2 * 2^{-(n-2)} + ... + d_n * 2^0\\n\\nThis is not a fractional part; it's an integer if scaled.\\n\\nActually, this sum ranges from 0 to sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i = 2^n - 1, so it's an integer between 0 and 2^n - 1.\\n\\nLet T_n = sum_{k=1}^n d_k 2^{n-k}  # this is the integer whose binary representation is d_1 d_2 ... d_n\\nThen sum_{k=1}^n d_k / 2^{n-k} = T_n / 2^{n-k} wait no.\\n\\n sum_{k=1}^n d_k / 2^{n-k} = sum_{k=1}^n d_k 2^{k-n} = 2^{-n} sum_{k=1}^n d_k 2^{k} \\n\\nBetter: sum_{k=1}^n d_k 2^{k-n} = 2^{-n} sum_{k=1}^n d_k 2^{k} \\n\\nBut sum_{k=1}^n d_k 2^{k} is not standard.\\n\\nFrom earlier:\n\nP_n = \\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} + \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{d_k}{2^{n-k+2}} = \\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} + \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{k=1}^n d_k 2^{k-n-1} wait.\n\n \\frac{d_k}{2^{n-k+2}} = d_k \\cdot 2^{k-n-2}\n\nSo P_n = 2^{-n-1} + \\sum_{k=1}^n d_k \\cdot 2^{k-n-2}\n\n= 2^{-n-2} \\left( 2 + \\sum_{k=1}^n d_k \\cdot 2^{k} \\right)\n\nThis is complicated.\n\nNotice that each application of the transformation is like adding a bit.\n\nI recall that for such a process, the final position is uniformly distributed on a certain set, but let's calculate for small n.\n\nLet n=0: P=0.5\n\nn=1:\n- heads: P=0.5/2 = 0.25\n- tails: (0.5+1)/2 = 0.75\n each with prob 1/2\n\nn=2:\n from 0.25:\n   heads: 0.25/2 = 0.125\n   tails: (0.25+1)/2 = 1.25/2 = 0.625\n from 0.75:\n   heads: 0.75/2 = 0.375\n   tails: (0.75+1)/2 = 1.75/2 = 0.875\n\nSo positions: 0.125, 0.625, 0.375, 0.875, each with prob 1/4\n\nWhich are 1/8, 5/8, 3/8, 7/8\n\nSo {1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8} = { (2m-1)/8 for m=1,2,3,4 }\n\nSimilarly, for n=1: 1/4, 3/4 = (2m-1)/4 for m=1,2\n\nn=0: 1/2 = 1/2\n\nSo it seems that after n steps, the position is of the form (2k-1)/2^{n+1} for k=1,2,...,2^n\n\nFor n=0: (2*1-1)/2^{1} = 1/2, yes\n\nn=1: (2k-1)/4 for k=1,2: 1/4, 3/4, yes\n\nn=2: (2k-1)/8 for k=1,2,3,4: 1/8,3/8,5/8,7/8, matches\n\nAnd each with equal probability 1/2^n\n\nIs that true?\n\nFor n=2, we have four outcomes, each with prob 1/4, and four values, so yes, uniform over those 4 points.\n\nSimilarly for n=1, two points, uniform.\n\nSo by induction, after n steps, Andy's position is uniformly distributed over the set { (2k-1)/2^{n+1} for k=1,2,...,2^n }\n\nThat is, the midpoints of the intervals [(j-1)/2^n, j/2^n] for j=1 to 2^n, but specifically the points (2k-1)/2^{n+1} = k/2^n - 1/2^{n+1}, which is the center of the k-th dyadic interval of length 1/2^n.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for n=2010, position X is uniform over { (2k-1)/2^{2011} for k=1,2,...,2^{2010} }\n\nThere are 2^{2010} points, each with probability 2^{-2010}\n\nNow, we need E[ |X - k| ], where k is some number.\n\nBut k = z + 1/2, and z is from the first part.\n\nNow, back to the first part.\n\nPerhaps in the first part, when they say \"find k = z + 1/2\", and z is the value that achieves the maximum, but since there are multiple, perhaps they mean the z that maximizes z^3 under the constraint, but that would be z=1, k=1.5\n\nBut then |X - 1.5|, and X ≤ (2*2^{2010}-1)/2^{2011} = (2^{2011}-1)/2^{2011} = 1 - 2^{-2011} < 1 < 1.5, so |X - 1.5| = 1.5 - X\n\nThen E[|X - 1.5|] = 1.5 - E[X] = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1, since E[X]=0.5 as we saw.\n\nBut is that the answer? 1\n\nBut let's see if there's a better interpretation.\n\nPerhaps the maximum of x + y^2 + z^3 is not 1, and I need to maximize it properly.\n\nEarlier I concluded it's at most 1, but let me try to see if it can be larger.\n\nSuppose x=0, y=0, z=1: value = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\n\nx=1, y=0, z=0: 1 + 0 + 0 = 1\n\nx=0, y=1, z=0: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1\n\nNow, try x=0.5, y=0.5, z=0: value = 0.5 + 0.25 + 0 = 0.75 < 1\n\nx=0, y=0.5, z=0.5: 0 + 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375 < 1\n\nx=0.2, y=0.2, z=0.6: 0.2 + 0.04 + 0.216 = 0.456 < 1\n\nSeems less.\n\nBut what if z is close to 1, y small, x small.\n\nSay z=0.99, then x+y=0.01\n\nTo maximize x + y^2 + z^3 ≈ x + y^2 + 0.970299\n\nMax x + y^2 with x+y=0.01, x,y≥0\n\nx = 0.01 - y, so f(y) = 0.01 - y + y^2\n\nDerivative: -1 + 2y, minimum at y=0.5, but y≤0.01, and since -1+2y<0 for y<0.5, so decreasing, so maximum at y=0, f=0.01\n\nSo total ≈ 0.01 + 0.970299 = 0.980299 < 1\n\nSimilarly, if z=1, it's 1.\n\nSo indeed, maximum is 1, achieved when z=1, or when y=1, or when x=1.\n\nNow, when x=1, z=0; when y=1, z=0; when z=1, z=1.\n\nSo z=0 or 1.\n\nNow, perhaps the problem intends for us to use the z from the maximizing triple, but maybe in the context, they want the z that makes z^3 large, so z=1.\n\nThen k = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5\n\nThen expected distance to k=1.5.\n\nAs above, X ≤ 1 - 2^{-2011} < 1 < 1.5, so |X - 1.5| = 1.5 - X\n\nE[|X - 1.5|] = 1.5 - E[X] = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1\n\nSo answer is 1.\n\nBut is k=1.5 on the segment? The segment is from H to T, length 1, so if H is at 0, T at 1, then k=1.5 is not on the segment, but the problem says \"the point on \\overline{HT} that is a distance k from H\" — if k>1, this point is not on the segment, which is a problem.\n\nUnless they allow it, but typically \"on the segment\" means within [0,1].\n\nPerhaps k is meant to be on the segment, so k≤1, so z≤0.5.\n\nBut in the maximizing triples, z=0 or 1, so z=0 gives k=0.5\n\nThen k=0.5\n\nThen expected distance to 0.5.\n\nNow, X is symmetric around 0.5? Let's see the distribution.\n\nThe set of possible X is { (2k-1)/2^{2011} for k=1,2,...,2^{2010} }\n\nFor example, n=1: 0.25, 0.75, symmetric around 0.5\n\nn=2: 0.125, 0.375, 0.625, 0.875, which is symmetric around 0.5\n\nIn general, the set is symmetric about 0.5, because if you have a point p = (2k-1)/2^{n+1}, then 1-p = 1 - (2k-1)/2^{n+1} = (2^{n+1} - 2k +1)/2^{n+1} = (2(2^n - k) +1)/2^{n+1} = (2m-1)/2^{n+1} where m = 2^n - k +1, and as k runs from 1 to 2^n, m runs from 2^n down to 1, so yes, the set is symmetric about 0.5.\n\nMoreover, since the coin flips are fair, the distribution is symmetric about 0.5.\n\nTherefore, E[|X - 0.5|] is the mean absolute deviation from the mean.\n\nSince the distribution is symmetric and discrete uniform on those points.\n\nFor any symmetric distribution around c, E[|X - c|] is well-defined.\n\nIn this case, c=0.5.\n\nNow, the points are at (2k-1)/2^{n+1} for k=1 to 2^n\n\nLet n=2010\n\nThe points are j / 2^{2011} for j=1,3,5,...,2^{2011}-1, i.e., odd integers from 1 to 2^{2011}-1.\n\nNumber of points: 2^{2010}\n\nDistance from 0.5 = |X - 0.5|\n\n0.5 = 2^{2010} / 2^{2011} = 2^{2010} / 2^{2011}\n\nX = (2k-1)/2^{2011} for k=1 to 2^{2010}\n\nSo X - 0.5 = [ (2k-1) - 2^{2010} ] / 2^{2011} = (2k - 1 - 2^{2010}) / 2^{2011}\n\nSince the distribution is symmetric, we can compute the average of |X - 0.5|.\n\nNote that the values of |X - 0.5| are | (2k-1) - 2^{2010} | / 2^{2011} for k=1 to 2^{2010}\n\nLet m = k, then the expression inside is |2m - 1 - 2^{2010}| / 2^{2011}\n\n2^{2010} is even, 2m-1 is odd, so never zero.\n\nThe values of 2m-1 range from 1 to 2^{2011}-1 step 2, i.e., all odd integers.\n\n2^{2010} is even, so the distance to 2^{2010} in the numerator.\n\nLet d_m = |2m - 1 - 2^{2010}|\n\nSince the set is symmetric, and 2^{2010} is the \"center\" in some sense.\n\nThe odd integers from 1 to 2^{2011}-1 are symmetric around 2^{2010}, because the mean of 1 and 2^{2011}-1 is (1 + 2^{2011}-1)/2 = 2^{2011}/2 = 2^{2010}\n\nAnd since they are arithmetic sequence with difference 2, symmetric about 2^{2010}.\n\nThe values 2m-1 for m=1 to 2^{2010} are 1,3,5,...,2^{2011}-1, which is an arithmetic sequence with first term 1, last 2^{2011}-1, number of terms 2^{2010}, common difference 2.\n\nThe middle of the range is (1 + 2^{2011}-1)/2 = 2^{2010}\n\nSince number of terms is even, there is no single middle term; the two middle terms are the 2^{2009}-th and (2^{2009}+1)-th terms.\n\nBut anyway, the set is symmetric about 2^{2010}.\n\nFor each point less than 2^{2010}, there is a corresponding point greater than 2^{2010} at the same distance.\n\nSpecifically, if a = 2m-1 < 2^{2010}, then b = 2^{2011} - a > 2^{2010}, and b - 2^{2010} = 2^{2011} - a - 2^{2010} = 2^{2010} - a = 2^{2010} - a, while 2^{2010} - a > 0, and b - 2^{2010} = 2^{2010} - a, so |b - 2^{2010}| = 2^{2010} - a = |a - 2^{2010}| since a < 2^{2010}\n\nSimilarly for a > 2^{2010}\n\nAnd since the mapping is one-to-one, and probabilities equal, the distribution of |X - 0.5| is such that we can compute the average.\n\nNow, |X - 0.5| = | (2m-1) - 2^{2010} | / 2^{2011}\n\nLet D_m = |2m-1 - 2^{2010}|\n\nThen |X - 0.5| = D_m / 2^{2011}\n\nD_m is the absolute difference.\n\nSince the set is symmetric, and we have 2^{2010} points, we can pair them.\n\nThe values of 2m-1 range from 1 to 2^{2011}-1 step 2.\n\nThe distance to 2^{2010} is minimized when 2m-1 is close to 2^{2010}.\n\n2^{2010} is even, so closest odds are 2^{2010}-1 and 2^{2010}+1\n\nFor example, if 2^{2010} = 4, then odds: 1,3,5,7, distances to 4: |1-4|=3, |3-4|=1, |5-4|=1, |7-4|=3\n\nSo values: 3,1,1,3\n\nAverage: (3+1+1+3)/4 = 8/4 = 2\n\nThen |X - 0.5| = D_m / 8, since 2^{n+1}=8 for n=2? n=2, 2^{3}=8\n\nX = (2m-1)/8, so |X - 0.5| = | (2m-1)/8 - 4/8 | = |2m-1 - 4| / 8\n\nSo for the values: |1-4|/8=3/8, |3-4|/8=1/8, |5-4|/8=1/8, |7-4|/8=3/8\n\nAverage: (3/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 3/8)/4 = (8/8)/4 = 1/4\n\nSum is 3/8+1/8+1/8+3/8 = 8/8 =1, divided by 4 is 0.25\n\nNow in general, for n steps, the sum of |X - 0.5| over all possibilities.\n\nSince each |X - 0.5| = | (2k-1) - 2^n | / 2^{n+1}  (since 0.5 = 2^n / 2^{n+1})\n\nFor n=2010, 0.5 = 2^{2010} / 2^{2011}\n\nX = (2k-1)/2^{2011}\n\nSo |X - 0.5| = |2k-1 - 2^{2010}| / 2^{2011}\n\nLet S = sum_{k=1}^{2^{2010}} |2k-1 - 2^{2010}|\n\nThen E[|X - 0.5|] = S / (2^{2010} * 2^{2011}) = S / 2^{4021}\n\nSince there are 2^{2010} terms, each with probability 2^{-2010}, so expected value is (1/2^{2010}) sum |X-0.5| = (1/2^{2010}) * sum_{k} |2k-1 - 2^{2010}| / 2^{2011} = [ sum |2k-1 - 2^{2010}| ] / (2^{2010} * 2^{2011}) = S / 2^{4021}\n\nNow compute S = sum_{k=1}^{M} |2k-1 - M| where M = 2^{2010}\n\n2k-1 ranges from 1 to 2M-1 step 2.\n\nThe values are the odd integers from 1 to 2M-1.\n\nM = 2^{2010}, even.\n\nThe sequence is 1,3,5,...,2M-1.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with difference 2.\n\nThe number of terms is M.\n\nThe values less than M: 2k-1 < M, so k < (M+1)/2\n\nSince M even, (M+1)/2 = M/2 + 0.5, so k ≤ M/2\n\nk from 1 to M/2, 2k-1 from 1 to M-1 (since k=M/2, 2*(M/2)-1 = M-1)\n\nValues: 1,3,5,...,M-1, which are the first M/2 odd numbers.\n\nNumber: M/2\n\nSimilarly, values greater than M: 2k-1 > M, so k > (M+1)/2, since M even, (M+1)/2 not integer, so k ≥ M/2 + 1\n\nk from M/2 +1 to M, 2k-1 from 2*(M/2+1)-1 = M+2-1 = M+1 to 2*M-1 = 2M-1\n\nValues: M+1, M+3, ..., 2M-1, number: M - M/2 = M/2\n\nValues equal to M: none, since M even, 2k-1 odd.\n\nFor each k from 1 to M/2, |2k-1 - M| = M - (2k-1) = M - 2k +1\n\nFor each k from M/2 +1 to M, |2k-1 - M| = (2k-1) - M = 2k -1 - M\n\nNow sum S = sum_{k=1}^{M/2} (M - 2k +1) + sum_{k=M/2 +1}^{M} (2k -1 - M)\n\nLet A = sum_{k=1}^{M/2} (M +1 - 2k)\n\nB = sum_{k=M/2 +1}^{M} (2k -1 - M)\n\nA = sum_{j=1}^{M/2} (M+1 - 2j) where j=k\n\n= (M/2)(M+1) - 2 sum_{j=1}^{M/2} j = (M/2)(M+1) - 2 * (1/2) (M/2)(M/2 +1) = (M/2)(M+1) - (M/2)(M/2 +1)\n\n= (M/2) [ (M+1) - (M/2 +1) ] = (M/2) (M+1 - M/2 -1) = (M/2)(M/2) = (M/2)(M/2) = M^2 / 4\n\nSimilarly, B = sum_{k=M/2 +1}^{M} (2k -1 - M) = sum_{k=M/2 +1}^{M} 2k - sum (1+M) = 2 sum_{k=M/2 +1}^{M} k - (1+M) * (number of terms)\n\nNumber of terms = M - M/2 = M/2\n\nsum_{k=M/2 +1}^{M} k = sum_{i=1}^{M/2} (M/2 + i) = (M/2)(M/2) + sum_{i=1}^{M/2} i = (M^2/4) + (1/2)(M/2)(M/2 +1) = M^2/4 + (M/4)(M/2 +1) = M^2/4 + M^2/8 + M/4 = (2M^2/8 + M^2/8) + M/4 = 3M^2/8 + M/4\n\nsum_{k=a}^{b} k = (b-a+1)(a+b)/2\n\nHere a = M/2 +1, b=M, number of terms = M - (M/2 +1) +1 = M - M/2 = M/2\n\nsum = (M/2) * (a+b)/2 = (M/2) * ( (M/2 +1) + M ) / 2 = (M/2) * (3M/2 +1)/2 = (M/2)(3M/4 + 1/2) = (M/2)(3M/4) + (M/2)(1/2) = 3M^2/8 + M/4\n\nYes.\n\nSo B = 2 * (3M^2/8 + M/4) - (1+M) * (M/2) = 2*(3M^2/8) + 2*(M/4) - (M/2)(1+M) = 6M^2/8 + 2M/4 - (M/2 + M^2/2) = (3M^2/4) + M/2 - M/2 - M^2/2 = 3M^2/4 - M^2/2 = 3M^2/4 - 2M^2/4 = M^2/4\n\nOh! So B = M^2 / 4\n\nAnd earlier A = M^2 / 4\n\nSo S = A + B = M^2 / 4 + M^2 / 4 = M^2 / 2\n\nNow M = 2^{2010}, so S = (2^{2010})^2 / 2 = 2^{4020} / 2 = 2^{4019}\n\nNow E[|X - 0.5|] = S / 2^{4021} = 2^{4019} / 2^{4021} = 2^{-2} = 1/4\n\nSo if k=0.5, expected distance is 1/4.\n\nBut is this the intended k?\n\nEarlier if k=1.5, we got 1.\n\nNow, which one is it?\n\nBack to the first part.\n\nPerhaps in the first part, when they say \"find k = z + 1/2\", and z is the value that achieves the maximum, but perhaps they mean that for the maximum to be achieved, and perhaps they imply that z is chosen to make z^3 large, but still.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the maximum is not 1, and I need to consider that x,y,z are chosen to maximize x+y^2+z^3, and perhaps the maximum is greater than 1, but mathematically it's impossible.\n\nUnless I miscalculated the constraint.\n\nx+y+z=1, all >=0.\n\nx + y^2 + z^3 <= x + y + z =1, since y^2 <= y, z^3 <= z for y,z in [0,1], with equality iff y=0 or 1, z=0 or 1.\n\nSo maximum is 1.\n\nPerhaps the \"instead\" part is a hint that we don't need to find the maximum, but directly find k.\n\nAnd perhaps in the maximizing triple, when z is maximized, z=1, k=1.5, but then the point is not on the segment.\n\nPerhaps k is not the point, but the distance, but the problem says \"the point on \\overline{HT} that is a distance k from H\", so if k>1, it's not on the segment.\n\nUnless the segment is extended, but typically not.\n\nPerhaps for the maximum, they have in mind a specific triple.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the maximum is achieved when x=0, y=0, z=1, so z=1, k=1.5, and even though it's not on the segment, we can still compute the distance.\n\nAnd as calculated, E[|X - 1.5|] = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1, since X<=1<1.5.\n\nAnd 1 is a nice number.\n\nIf k=0.5, we got 1/4, also nice.\n\nBut let's see the answer.\n\nPerhaps in the first part, \"find k = z + 1/2\" and z is from the maximizing triple, but perhaps they want the value of z for which the maximum is achieved, but in the context, perhaps when we set y=0, and maximize 1 - z + z^3, but as we saw, it's maximized at endpoints, z=0 or 1.\n\nBut at z=1, f=1, at z=0, f=1, same.\n\nBut perhaps they consider the maximum over z, but it's not unique.\n\nPerhaps the problem is to minimize x+y^2+z^3, but it says maximum.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps \"non-negative real numbers\" and \"achieve this maximum\", but maybe there is a unique maximum when we consider the expression.\n\nOr perhaps I need to maximize x+y^2+z^3, and it turns out that the maximum is achieved when z is specific.\n\nLet's assume that at maximum, x=0, because if x>0, we can increase y or z to increase the expression, but not necessarily.\n\nFrom earlier analysis, the maximum is 1, achieved when (x,y,z) = (1,0,0), (0,1,0), or (0,0,1).\n\nAmong these, the value of z is 0,0,1 respectively.\n\nSo z=0 or 1.\n\nNow, k = z + 1/2 = 0.5 or 1.5.\n\nNow, for the Andy part, if k=0.5, expected distance is 1/4.\n\nIf k=1.5, expected distance is 1.\n\nNow, perhaps the problem intends k=0.5, since it's on the segment.\n\nMaybe they want the expected distance, and for k=0.5, it's 1/4, which is 2^{-2}, and for large n, it makes sense.\n\nBut let's see if there's a different interpretation.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"find k = z + 1/2\" where z is the value that maximizes the expression, but perhaps they mean that z is the value that is used in the cubic term, and in the optimal solution, z is 1, so k=1.5.\n\nBut then the point is not on the segment.\n\nPerhaps the segment is from 0 to 1, and k is 1.5, but the distance is still defined as |position - k|, even if k not on segment.\n\nIn that case, E[|X - 1.5|] = 1.5 - E[X] = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1, since X ≤ 1 < 1.5.\n\nAnd 1 is a nice answer.\n\nPerhaps for the maximum, they have in mind that when z=1, x=y=0, so z=1, k=1.5.\n\nAnd the expected distance is 1.\n\nPerhaps the \"indecisive Andy\" part is independent, but no, it depends on k.\n\nAnother thought: in the first part, perhaps the maximum is not 1, and I need to solve it correctly.\n\nLet me try to maximize f = x + y^2 + z^3 subject to x+ y+ z =1, x,y,z≥0.\n\nFrom x=1-y-z, f = 1-y-z + y^2 + z^3 = 1 + y^2 - y + z^3 - z\n\nLet g(y) = y^2 - y, h(z) = z^3 - z\n\ng(y) = y(y-1) ≤ 0 for y in [0,1], minimum at y=0.5, g(0.5)= -0.25\n\nh(z) = z(z^2-1) ≤ 0 for z in [0,1], minimum at z=1/sqrt(3)≈0.577, h(0.577)≈0.577*(0.333-1) =0.577*(-0.667)≈ -0.385\n\nSo f = 1 + g(y) + h(z) ≤ 1, with equality when g(y)=0 and h(z)=0, i.e., y=0 or 1, z=0 or 1, and x=1-y-z≥0, which requires that not both y=1 and z=1, so the three cases.\n\nSo indeed, maximum is 1.\n\nNow, perhaps the problem is that for the maximum to be achieved, and they want z from the triple where z is maximized, so z=1, k=1.5.\n\nThen for Andy, expected distance to k=1.5.\n\nAs X ≤ 1 - 2^{-2011} < 1 < 1.5, so |X - 1.5| = 1.5 - X\n\nE[|X - 1.5|] = 1.5 - E[X] = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1\n\nSo answer is 1.\n\nPerhaps they want the expected distance, and it's 1.\n\nOr perhaps k=0.5, and answer 1/4.\n\nBut let's see the year 2010, perhaps it's designed to be nice.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"k = z + 1/2\" and z is not from the triple, but something else, but the problem says \"where z is the value of the variable with the cubic term in the non-negative real numbers x,y,z satisfying x+y+z=1 that achieve this maximum.\"\n\nSo it is from the triple.\n\nPerhaps in the maximum, when we have x=0, y=0, z=1, so z=1, k=1.5.\n\nAnd for Andy, after many steps, X is close to uniform on [0,1], but in this case, it's discrete, but for large n, E[|X - c|] for c=1.5 is approximately 1.5 - 0.5 = 1, since X<1.\n\nExactly, as calculated, 1.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 1.\n\nPerhaps for k=0.5, it's 1/4, but 1/4 is also possible.\n\nBut let's calculate for small n what it should be.\n\nSuppose n=0, no moves, Andy at 0.5.\n\nThen if k=0.5, distance |0.5-0.5|=0\n\nIf k=1.5, |0.5-1.5|=1\n\nBut n=0, but the problem has 2010 moves.\n\nFor n=1, if k=0.5, positions 0.25 or 0.75, |0.25-0.5|=0.25, |0.75-0.5|=0.25, expected 0.25\n\nAccording to formula, for n=1, M=2^1=2, S = sum_{k=1}^{2} |2k-1 - 2| = |1-2| + |3-2| =1+1=2, E[|X-0.5|] = S / 2^{1+1+1} wait earlier for n steps, E = S / 2^{2n+1}? For n=2010, S / 2^{4021} = 2^{4019} / 2^{4021} = 1/4\n\nFor n=1, M=2^1=2, S = sum_{k=1}^{2} |2k-1 - 2| = |1-2| + |3-2| =1+1=2, E = S / 2^{2*1 +1} = 2 / 2^3 = 2/8=0.25, matches.\n\nFor k=1.5, E[|X-1.5|] = for n=1, X=0.25 or 0.75, |0.25-1.5|=1.25, |0.75-1.5|=0.75, expected (1.25+0.75)/2 = 2/2=1\n\nAnd 1.5 - 0.5 =1, same.\n\nFor any n, since X ≤ 1 - 2^{-n-1} < 1 < 1.5, so |X - 1.5| = 1.5 - X, so E[|X - 1.5|] = 1.5 - E[X] = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1\n\nSo for any n, it's 1.\n\nFor k=0.5, it's 1/4 for n>=1, but for n=0, it would be 0, but here n=2010>0.\n\nNow, which k to choose?\n\nPerhaps the problem intends for us to use the z from the triple where the maximum is achieved and z is as large as possible, so z=1, k=1.5, and expected distance is 1.\n\nPerhaps there is a different interpretation of the first part.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"find k = z + 1/2\" and z is not the value, but something else, but the text says \"where z is the value of the variable\".\n\nPerhaps in the maximum, they mean the value of z that makes the expression large, but in the optimal solution.\n\nOr perhaps the maximum is achieved when z=1, and that's the intended one.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 1.\n\nPerhaps for the Andy part, the expected distance is always 1 if k=1.5, which is nice.\n\nOr perhaps k=0.5, and 1/4.\n\nBut let's look at the title \"Indecisive Andy\", and he moves halfway, and after many moves, his position is very close to 0 or 1, but actually, the distribution is spread out, but expected position is 0.5.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that k is 1, but k = z + 1/2, so if k=1, z=0.5, but z=0.5 does not achieve the maximum, since at z=0.5, if y=0, x=0.5, f=0.5 + 0 + 0.125=0.625<1.\n\nSo not.\n\nPerhaps the maximum is not 1, and I need to consider that x,y,z can be chosen, and perhaps when z is such that z^3 is large, but with x and y adjusted.\n\nBut as per calculation, it can't exceed 1.\n\nUnless the constraint is x+y+z=1, but perhaps they can be greater, but no, non-negative, sum 1.\n\nPerhaps \"non-negative\" includes zero, which it does.\n\nI think the only possibilities are k=0.5 or k=1.5.\n\nNow, perhaps the problem expects k=0.5, and expected distance 1/4.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nPerhaps in the context, since Andy starts at 0.5, and k=0.5, it makes sense.\n\nBut why mention z etc.\n\nAnother thought: in the first part, \"find k = z + 1/2\", and z is the value, but perhaps for the maximum, when we have the triple, and perhaps they want the z from the triple where x=0, y=0, z=1, so z=1, k=1.5.\n\nAnd then expected distance is 1.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 1.\n\nPerhaps \" the point on \\overline{HT} that is a distance k from H\" and if k>1, it's not on the segment, so probably k≤1, so z≤0.5, so z=0, k=0.5.\n\nThen expected distance is 1/4.\n\nAnd 1/4 is 0.25, which is nice.\n\nFor large n, the mean absolute deviation from mean for a uniform-like distribution on [0,1] is 1/4, since for continuous uniform on [0,1], E[|X-0.5|] = 2 \\int_0^{0.5} (0.5-x) dx = 2 [0.5x - x^2/2]_0^{0.5} = 2 (0.5*0.5 - (0.25)/2) = 2 (0.25 - 0.125) = 2*0.125 = 0.25 = 1/4.\n\nAnd here for large n, it approaches that, and for n=2010, it is exactly 1/4, as calculated.\n\nWhereas for k=1.5, it's 1, which is constant.\n\nSo perhaps k=0.5 is intended.\n\nPerhaps in the maximizing triple, when z=0, for example in (1,0,0) or (0,1,0), so z=0, k=0.5.\n\nAnd since there are two such triples with z=0, and one with z=1, perhaps they want the majority, but not specified.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that for the maximum to be achieved, z can be 0, so k=0.5.\n\nI think both are possible, but perhaps the intended answer is 1/4.\n\nPerhaps \" instead of finding the maximum\" implies that we don't need to care about the maximum, but just use the z from the context, but it's circular.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"k = z + 1/2\" and z is not from the triple, but the value that maximizes something, but the text says \"where z is the value of the variable... that achieve this maximum.\"\n\nSo it is from the triple.\n\nPerhaps in the optimal solution, z is 0, because if z>0, we can increase x or y to get higher, but in (0,0,1), it's 1, same as others.\n\nI think it's ambiguous, but perhaps the safe choice is to take z=0, k=0.5, and expected distance 1/4.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 1/4.\n\nPerhaps for the Andy part, with k=0.5, and n=2010 large, but we have exact 1/4.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nSo k = 0.5\n\nThen expected distance is 1/4.\n\nSo answer is 1/4.\n\nBut let's box it.\n\nPerhaps the problem has a typo, and it's minimize, but it says maximum.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps \"x + y^2 + z^3\" and they want to maximize, but with x+y+z=1, and perhaps they mean that z is fixed or something, but no.\n\nPerhaps in the expression, it's x + y^2 + z^3, and for the maximum, it occurs when z=1, but then k=1.5.\n\nI recall that in some problems, they include the endpoint.\n\nPerhaps the point k=1.5 is allowed, and distance is defined.\n\nBut in that case, expected distance is 1.\n\nBut 1 is simpler.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 1.\n\nLet's see the year 2010, and 1 is nice.\n\nPerhaps for the first part, they intend z=1.\n\nI think I'll go with k=1.5, expected distance 1.\n\nSo answer is 1.\n\nSo \n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
