Julia has a 300 GB hard drive, so we first convert this to megabytes:\\n\\n300 GB = 300 × 1024 = 307,200 MB.\\n\\nShe puts 300,000 MB of data onto the hard drive. To find the remaining empty space:\\n\\nEmpty space = Total capacity - Used space = 307,200 MB - 300,000 MB = 7,200 MB.\\n\\nSo, 7,200 MB of storage remains empty.\\n\\nProblem 2: First, calculate the regular total price:\\n\\nBicycle: $320\\nHelmet: $80\\nTotal regular price = 320 + 80 = $400.\\n\\nNow, calculate the sale prices:\\n\\nBicycle is 20% off: 20% of 320 = 0.20 × 320 = $64 discount.\\nSale price of bicycle = 320 - 64 = $256.\\n\\nHelmet is 10% off: 10% of 80 = 0.10 × 80 = $8 discount.\\nSale price of helmet = 80 - 8 = $72.\\n\\nTotal sale price = 256 + 72 = $328.\\n\\nAmount saved = Regular total - Sale total = 400 - 328 = $72.\\n\\nPercentage savings = (Amount saved / Regular total) × 100 = (72 / 400) × 100 = 18%.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"7200\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"18%\"\n}",
