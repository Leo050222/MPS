Then r ≤ min(10, 7, 3) = 3, since we can't have more than the smallest starting count.\\n\\nSo maximum possible equal remaining is 3 of each.\\n\\nCan we achieve r = 3?\\n- Red: start with 10 → eat 7 → 3 left\\n- Yellow: start with 7 → eat 4 → 3 left\\n- Blue: start with 3 → eat 0 → 3 left\\nYes, possible.\\n\\nThen total eaten = 7 (red) + 4 (yellow) + 0 (blue) = 11\\n\\nIs it possible to eat fewer than 11? Only if we leave more than 3 of each, but blue only has 3, so r cannot exceed 3. So maximum r is 3.\\nThus minimum candies eaten is when r = 3, total eaten = (10 - 3) + (7 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 7 + 4 + 0 = 11\\n\\nSo the smallest possible number of candies Shuxin ate is 11.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"44\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
