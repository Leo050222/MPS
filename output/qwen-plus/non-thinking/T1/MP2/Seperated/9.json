Correct.\\n\\nProblem 2: The original line is y = x + 4. Its y-intercept occurs when x = 0: y = 0 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nTranslating the line down by 6 units means subtracting 6 from the entire function:\\nNew equation: y = x + 4 - 6 = x - 2.\\n\\nThe y-intercept of this new line is when x = 0: y = 0 - 2 = -2.\\n\\nSo, the y-intercept after translation is -2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"40\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-2\"\n}",
