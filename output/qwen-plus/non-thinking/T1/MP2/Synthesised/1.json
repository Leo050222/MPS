  "math_problem": "Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. Friday, at which point it had been on for exactly 100 hours. At what time had Kamile turned her computer on? Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day. Three different numbers from the list $2, 3, 4, 6$ have a sum of $k$. What is the product of these numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given that the computer was on for exactly 100 hours and was turned off at 5 p.m. on Friday. However, instead of finding the exact time it was turned on, we are to compute:\\n\\n1. $ k = h + 7 $, where $ h $ is the remainder when the total duration (100 hours) is divided by the number of hours in a day (24).\\n\\nSo first, compute $ h = 100 \\\\mod 24 $:\\n\\n$ 100 \\\\div 24 = 4 $ with a remainder of $ 4 $, because $ 24 \\\\times 4 = 96 $, and $ 100 - 96 = 4 $.\\n\\nThus, $ h = 4 $, and so:\\n\\n$ k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 $.\\n\\nNow, we are told that three different numbers from the list $ \\\\{2, 3, 4, 6\\\\} $ have a sum of $ k = 11 $.\\n\\nCheck all combinations of three different numbers from the list:\\n\\n- $ 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 $\\n- $ 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 $ ✅\\n- $ 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 $\\n- $ 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 $\\n\\nOnly $ 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 $, so the three numbers are 2, 3, and 6.\\n\\nNow compute their product:\\n\\n$ 2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 6 = 6 \\\\times 6 = 36 $.\\n\\nThus, the answer is 36.\",\n    \"answer\": \"36\"\n}",
