  "math_problem": "If \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers with \\( x>y \\) and \\( x+x y=391 \\), what is the value of \\( x+y \\)? Instead of finding the sum of the two positive integers satisfying the given equation and inequality, simply find \\( k = y + 14 \\), where \\( y \\) is the smaller positive integer in the pair that solves the equation under the stated conditions. There are \\( k \\) people in a room, 60% of whom are men. If no men enter or leave the room, how many women must enter the room so that 40% of the total number of people in the room are men?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given the equation:\\n\\n$$\\nx + xy = 391\\n$$\\n\\nFactor the left-hand side:\\n\\n$$\\nx(1 + y) = 391\\n$$\\n\\nWe are told that $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, and $x > y$. We need to find such values.\\n\\nSo, $x$ and $1 + y$ are positive integers such that their product is 391.\\n\\nFirst, factor 391.\\n\\nCheck divisibility:\\n\\n- 391 ÷ 17 = 23 → because 17 × 23 = 391\\n- Also, 391 ÷ 1 = 391, 391 ÷ 391 = 1\\n\\nSo the positive factor pairs of 391 are:\\n\\n- (1, 391)\\n- (17, 23)\\n- (23, 17)\\n- (391, 1)\\n\\nNow recall: $x(1 + y) = 391$, so $x$ is one factor, and $1 + y$ is the other.\\n\\nTry each possibility:\\n\\n**Case 1:** $x = 1$, $1 + y = 391$ → $y = 390$, but $x = 1 < y = 390$, violates $x > y$\\n\\n**Case 2:** $x = 17$, $1 + y = 23$ → $y = 22$, now check $x > y$: 17 > 22? No. Invalid.\\n\\n**Case 3:** $x = 23$, $1 + y = 17$ → $y = 16$, now $x = 23 > 16 = y$: valid.\\n\\n**Case 4:** $x = 391$, $1 + y = 1$ → $y = 0$, not a positive integer → invalid.\\n\\nSo only valid solution is $x = 23$, $y = 16$\\n\\nNow compute $k = y + 14 = 16 + 14 = 30$\\n\\nSo there are $k = 30$ people in a room.\\n\\n60% are men: $0.6 \\\\times 30 = 18$ men\\n\\nSo women: $30 - 18 = 12$\\n\\nNow, we want to add some number of women (only women), say $w$, so that men become 40% of the new total.\\n\\nNew total: $30 + w$\\n\\nMen: still 18\\n\\nWe want:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{18}{30 + w} = 0.4\\n$$\\n\\nSolve:\\n\\n$$\\n18 = 0.4(30 + w) \\\\\\\\\\n18 = 12 + 0.4w \\\\\\\\\\n6 = 0.4w \\\\\\\\\\nw = \\\\frac{6}{0.4} = 15\\n$$\\n\\nSo 15 women must enter.\\n\\nFinal answer is 15.\",\n    \"answer\": \"15\"\n}",
