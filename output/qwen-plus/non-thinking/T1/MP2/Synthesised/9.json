  "math_problem": "Consider the following flowchart: INPUT $\\rightarrow$ Subtract $8 \\rightarrow \\square \\rightarrow$ Divide by $2 \\rightarrow \\square$ Add $16 \\rightarrow$ OUTPUT. If the OUTPUT is 32, what was the INPUT? Instead of determining the initial input value that produces the specified output via the flowchart's sequence of operations, simply find $k = A - 26$, where $A$ is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step. What is the $y$-intercept of the line $y = x + 4$ after it is translated down $k$ units?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given a flowchart and asked to work backwards from the OUTPUT to find an intermediate value, then use that to compute a transformation of a line.\\n\\nFlowchart steps:\\n1. INPUT → Subtract 8 → A (this is the first square)\\n2. A → Divide by 2 → B\\n3. B → Add 16 → OUTPUT = 32\\n\\nStep 1: Work backwards from OUTPUT = 32\\n- Before adding 16: B = 32 - 16 = 16\\n- Before dividing by 2: A = 16 × 2 = 32\\n\\nSo the intermediate quantity A (at the first square) is 32.\\n\\nNow compute: k = A - 26 = 32 - 26 = 6\\n\\nNow consider the line y = x + 4.\\nIts y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0: y = 0 + 4 = 4.\\n\\nTranslate this line down by k = 6 units: subtract 6 from the y-values.\\nNew y-intercept = 4 - 6 = -2.\\n\\nTherefore, the y-intercept after translation is -2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-2\"\n}",
