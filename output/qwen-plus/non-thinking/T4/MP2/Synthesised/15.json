  "math_problem": "A sequence of functions $\\\\{ f_n(x) \\\\} $ is defined recursively as follows: \\begin{align*} f_1(x) &= \\sqrt {x^2 + 48}, \\quad \\text{and} \\\\ f_{n + 1}(x) &= \\sqrt {x^2 + 6f_n(x)} \\quad \\text{for } n \\geq 1. \\end{align*} (Recall that $\\sqrt {\\makebox[5mm]{}}$ is understood to represent the positive square root .) For each positive integer $n$ , find all real solutions of the equation $ f_n(x) = 2x $ . Instead of finding all real solutions of the equation $f_n(x) = 2x$ for each positive integer $n$, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the constant satisfying $f_1(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 6k}$ derived from the given definition. One day, there is a Street Art Show at somewhere, and there are some spectators around. We consider this place as an Euclidean plane. Let $K$ be the center of the show. And name the spectators by $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}, \\ldots$ They pick their positions $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}, \\ldots$ one by one. The positions need to satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously. (i) The distance between $K$ and $A_{n}$ is no less than 10 meters, that is, $K P_{n} \\geq 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any positive integer $n$. (ii) The distance between $A_{n}$ and any previous spectator is no less than $k$ meters, that is, $P_{m} P_{n} \\geq k \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any $n \\geq 2$ and any $1 \\leq m \\leq n-1$. (iii) $A_{n}$ always choose the position closest to $K$ that satisfies (i) and (ii), that is, $K P_{n}$ reaches its minimum possible value. If there are more than one point that satisfy (i) and (ii) and have the minimum distance to $K, A_{n}$ may choose any one of them. For example, $A_{1}$ is not restricted by (ii), so he may choose any point on the circle $C$ which is centered at $K$ with radius 10 meters. For $A_{2}$, since there are lots of points on $C$ which are at least $k$ meters apart from $P_{1}$, he may choose anyone of them. (1) Which of the following statement is true? (A) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2}$ always hold (unit: meter); (B) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\sqrt{n} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} \\sqrt{n}$ always hold (unit: meter); (C) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n$ always hold (unit: meter); (D) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n^{2} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n^{2}$ always hold (unit: meter).",

The optimal packing density in the plane is hexagonal, with area per point approximately:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Area per point} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} d^2 \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\cdot 64 \\\\approx 55.4 \\\\, \\\\text{m}^2\\n$$\\n\\nIf $ n $ points are packed in a disk of radius $ R_n = KP_n $, then the area is roughly $ \\\\pi R_n^2 $, so:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\pi R_n^2 \\\\gtrsim c \\\\cdot n \\\\Rightarrow R_n \\\\gtrsim \\\\sqrt{n}\\n$$\\n\\nIn fact, since the number of points that can be placed within radius $ R $ with mutual distance at least $ d $ is $ O(R^2) $, then to place $ n $ points, we must have $ R_n = \\\\Omega(\\\\sqrt{n}) $.\\n\\nMoreover, because the algorithm places each point as close to $ K $ as possible, the configuration should fill up the disk efficiently. Thus, the minimal possible maximum radius grows like $ \\\\sqrt{n} $, and $ KP_n $, being the distance of the $ n $-th point, should be on the order of $ \\\\sqrt{n} $.\\n\\nCan we bound $ KP_n $ above and below by constant multiples of $ \\\\sqrt{n} $? \\n\\nYes — due to packing density:\\n\\n- Lower bound: To fit $ n $ points with pairwise distance $ \\\\geq 8 $, they must occupy area $ \\\\geq c n $, so the radius must be $ \\\\geq c' \\\\sqrt{n} $\\n- Upper bound: Since each point is chosen greedily closest to center, the process cannot do worse than some constant factor of optimal packing. So $ KP_n \\\\leq C \\\\sqrt{n} $\\n\\nThus, there exist constants $ c_1, c_2 > 0 $ such that for all $ n $, no matter how earlier choices were made (but following the rules), we have:\\n\\n$$\\nc_1 \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\leq KP_n \\\\leq c_2 \\\\sqrt{n}\\n$$\\n\\nNote: Even though $ A_n $ may choose among multiple valid positions, condition (iii) ensures it picks one minimizing $ KP_n $, so the growth is controlled.\\n\\nTherefore, option (B) is correct.\\n\\n(A) says bounded, which is false — as $ n \\\\to \\\\infty $, points must go outward.\\n(C) and (D) suggest linear or quadratic growth, which is too fast — area grows quadratically with radius, so radius should grow as $ \\\\sqrt{n} $, not $ n $ or $ n^2 $.\\n\\nHence, the correct answer is (B).\",\n    \"answer\": \"B\"\n}",
