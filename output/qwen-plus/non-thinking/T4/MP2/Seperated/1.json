P(x) divides Q(x)^2 + 1,\\n2. Q(x) divides P(x)^2 + 1.\\n\\nLet’s denote:\\n- P | Q^2 + 1,\\n- Q | P^2 + 1.\\n\\nSince both are monic, we can work in C[x], a UFD.\\n\\nLet d = deg(P), e = deg(Q).\\n\\nFrom P | Q^2 + 1, we have deg(P) ≤ deg(Q^2 + 1) = 2e (since deg(Q^2) = 2e and deg(1)=0).\\nSo d ≤ 2e.\\n\\nSimilarly, from Q | P^2 + 1, e ≤ 2d.\\n\\nSo we have:\\nd ≤ 2e and e ≤ 2d.\\n\\nThis implies the degrees are comparable.\\n\\nTry small degrees.\\n\\nCase 1: deg(P) = 0 → P is constant. But it's monic ⇒ P(x) = 1.\\nThen P | Q^2 + 1 ⇒ 1 divides anything, always true.\\nNow Q | P^2 + 1 = 1^2 + 1 = 2 ⇒ Q divides 2.\\nBut Q is monic polynomial ⇒ if constant, Q=1; but then Q divides 2 ⇒ 1|2 OK.\\nBut deg(Q) ≥ 0.\\nIf Q is nonconstant, then monic and divides 2? Only possible if Q is constant, since 2 is constant.\\nSo Q must be constant ⇒ monic ⇒ Q=1.\\nSo (P,Q) = (1,1). Check:\\nP divides Q^2+1: 1 divides 1+1=2 ⇒ yes.\\nQ divides P^2+1: 1 divides 1+1=2 ⇒ yes.\\nOK.\\nBut are constants allowed? The problem says \\\"polynomials\\\", which includes constants. And leading coefficient 1 — for degree 0, leading coefficient is the constant itself, so must be 1. So (1,1) is valid.\\n\\nBut maybe more?\\n\\nTry P(x) = x, monic.\\nThen need Q such that:\\nx divides Q(x)^2 + 1,\\nand Q divides x^2 + 1.\\n\\nFrom second: Q divides x^2 + 1 ⇒ deg(Q) ≤ 2.\\nAnd Q monic.\\nAlso, x | Q(x)^2 + 1 ⇒ Q(0)^2 + 1 = 0 ⇒ Q(0)^2 = -1 ⇒ Q(0) = ±i.\\n\\nPossible Q: divisors of x^2 + 1, monic.\\nDivisors: 1, x+i, x-i, x^2+1.\\nCheck which satisfy Q(0) = ±i.\\n- Q=1: Q(0)=1 ≠ ±i\\n- Q=x+i: Q(0)=i ⇒ good\\n- Q=x-i: Q(0)=-i ⇒ good\\n- Q=x^2+1: Q(0)=1 ⇒ no\\n\\nTry Q(x) = x+i.\\nThen check if P=x divides Q^2 + 1.\\nQ^2 + 1 = (x+i)^2 + 1 = x^2 + 2ix -1 + 1 = x^2 + 2ix.\\nDoes x divide this? Yes, since no constant term.\\nNow check if Q divides P^2 + 1: P^2 + 1 = x^2 + 1.\\nDoes x+i divide x^2 + 1?\\nPlug x = -i: (-i)^2 + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0 ⇒ yes.\\nSimilarly, Q = x-i: same thing.\\nBut P=x, Q=x-i.\\nQ^2 + 1 = (x-i)^2 + 1 = x^2 - 2ix -1 + 1 = x^2 - 2ix, divisible by x? Yes.\\nP^2 + 1 = x^2 + 1, divided by x-i: plug x=i: i^2 + 1 = -1+1=0 ⇒ yes.\\n\\nBut are P and Q both monic? Yes.\\nSo (x, x+i), (x, x-i) are solutions?\\nBut wait: P=x, Q=x+i.\\nIs P dividing Q^2+1? Yes.\\nIs Q dividing P^2+1? Yes.\\nSeems valid.\\n\\nBut the problem asks for pairs of polynomials. Are these acceptable?\\nBut let’s see symmetry.\\n\\nWait, but also try swapping.\\nSuppose P = x+i, Q = x.\\nThen P divides Q^2+1 = x^2+1? Does x+i divide x^2+1? Yes, as above.\\nQ divides P^2+1: P^2+1 = (x+i)^2 + 1 = x^2 + 2ix -1 + 1 = x^2 + 2ix.\\nDoes Q=x divide this? Yes.\\nSo (x+i, x) is also a solution.\\nSimilarly (x-i, x), (x, x+i), etc.\\n\\nBut also (1,1) as before.\\n\\nBut perhaps there are more.\\n\\nNotice that if (P,Q) is a solution, so might be (Q,P)? Not necessarily, because the conditions are symmetric in a way.\\nIndeed: the two conditions are symmetric: P|Q^2+1 and Q|P^2+1.\\nSo if (P,Q) is a solution, so is (Q,P).\\n\\nNow, back to (x, x+i): works.\\nBut are there higher degree?\\n\\nTry to assume that P and Q are linear.\\nLet P(x) = x + a, Q(x) = x + b, monic.\\nConditions:\\nx+a divides (x+b)^2 + 1 = x^2 + 2bx + b^2 + 1.\\nSo plugging x = -a: (-a + b)^2 + 1 = 0 ⇒ (b-a)^2 = -1 ⇒ b-a = ±i.\\nSimilarly, Q divides P^2 + 1: x+b divides (x+a)^2 + 1 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + 1.\\nPlug x = -b: (-b+a)^2 + 1 = 0 ⇒ (a-b)^2 = -1 ⇒ same as above.\\nSo condition is (a-b)^2 = -1 ⇒ a-b = ±i.\\nSo for any a, set b = a ± i.\\nThus P(x) = x + a, Q(x) = x + a ± i.\\nCheck:\\nP divides Q^2 + 1: at x=-a, Q(-a)^2 +1 = (-a + a ± i)^2 +1 = (±i)^2 +1 = -1+1=0 ⇒ yes.\\nSimilarly, Q divides P^2 +1: at x= -b = -a ∓ i, P(-b) = -b + a = -(a ± i) + a = ∓i, so P(-b)^2 +1 = (∓i)^2 +1 = -1+1=0 ⇒ yes.\\nSo all such linear pairs work.\\nBut are they all? For example, P(x)=x, Q(x)=x+i: a=0, b=i, b-a=i, so yes.\\nSimilarly, P(x)=x+1, Q(x)=x+1+i, etc.\\nSo infinitely many?\\nBut the problem says \\\"determine all pairs\\\".\\nBut perhaps constant also fits? Constant: P=1, Q=1.\\nBut 1 is degree 0, not linear.\\nAre there others?\\n\\nWhat about quadratic?\\nSuppose P and Q are both degree 2.\\nAssume P(x) = x^2 + a x + b, Q(x) = x^2 + c x + d.\\nNow, P divides Q^2 + 1.\\nQ^2 + 1 has degree 4, so P divides it ⇒ quotient is quadratic.\\nSimilarly, Q divides P^2 + 1, which is degree 4, so quotient quadratic.\\nThis seems messy.\\n\\nNote that from P | Q^2 + 1, then Q^2 ≡ -1 mod P.\\nSimilarly, P^2 ≡ -1 mod Q.\\nSo in the ring C[x]/(P), Q^2 = -1.\\nSimilarly, in C[x]/(Q), P^2 = -1.\\n\\nNow, suppose deg(P) = d, deg(Q) = e.\\nAs before, d ≤ 2e, e ≤ 2d.\\n\\nSuppose d = e.\\nThen from d ≤ 2d, ok.\\nAssume deg(P) = deg(Q) = n.\\nThen P | Q^2 + 1, deg(Q^2 +1) = 2n, so deg(P) = n ≤ 2n, and since P divides it, the quotient has degree n.\\nSimilarly for the other.\\n\\nNow, leading coefficients: P and Q monic.\\nQ^2 has leading term x^{2n}, so Q^2 +1 ~ x^{2n}.\\nP is degree n, monic, so quotient R = (Q^2 +1)/P is monic of degree n.\\nSimilarly, S = (P^2 +1)/Q is monic of degree n.\\n\\nNow, consider degrees.\\nWe had d ≤ 2e, e ≤ 2d.\\nSuppose d < e.\\nThen e ≤ 2d, and d ≤ 2e.\\nFor example, d=1, e=2: 1≤4, 2≤2 ⇒ ok.\\nTry: P linear, Q quadratic.\\nP(x) = x + a, monic.\\nQ(x) = x^2 + b x + c, monic.\\nCondition 1: P | Q^2 + 1 ⇒ Q(-a)^2 + 1 = 0.\\nCondition 2: Q | P^2 + 1.\\nP^2 + 1 = (x+a)^2 + 1 = x^2 + 2a x + a^2 + 1.\\nQ divides this? But deg(Q)=2, deg(P^2+1)=2, so Q divides it only if they are associates. But both monic, so Q = P^2 + 1.\\nSo Q(x) = x^2 + 2a x + (a^2 + 1).\\nNow, condition 1: P | Q^2 + 1 ⇒ Q(-a)^2 + 1 = 0.\\nCompute Q(-a) = (-a)^2 + 2a(-a) + a^2 + 1 = a^2 - 2a^2 + a^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1.\\nThen Q(-a)^2 + 1 = 1^2 + 1 = 2 ≠ 0.\\nNot zero! Contradiction.\\nSo cannot have d=1, e=2.\\n\\nWhat if d=1, e=1? We already did: works when |a-b|=i in some sense, earlier for linear both.\\nIn linear case, both degree 1, we have solutions.\\n\\nNow d=2, e=1: similar by symmetry.\\nP degree 2, Q degree 1.\\nThen similarly, Q | P^2 + 1, deg(P^2+1)=4, deg(Q)=1, so possible.\\nBut P | Q^2 +1: deg(Q^2+1)=2, deg(P)=2, so P divides it ⇒ since both degree 2 and monic, P = Q^2 + 1.\\nSo P(x) = Q(x)^2 + 1.\\nQ is monic linear, say Q(x) = x + b.\\nThen P(x) = (x+b)^2 + 1 = x^2 + 2b x + b^2 + 1.\\nNow, Q | P^2 + 1.\\nP^2 + 1 is degree 4, Q degree 1, so Q divides it iff P(-b)^2 + 1 = 0.\\nCompute P(-b) = (-b)^2 + 2b(-b) + b^2 + 1 = b^2 - 2b^2 + b^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1.\\nThen P(-b)^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 ≠ 0.\\nAgain not zero.\\nSo no solution when degrees differ by 1 in this way.\\n\\nNow try d=2, e=2.\\nBoth degree 2.\\nP(x) = x^2 + a x + b, Q(x) = x^2 + c x + d.\\nNow P | Q^2 + 1.\\nQ^2 + 1 is degree 4, P degree 2, so quotient is quadratic, say R(x), monic (since both leading coeffs 1).\\nSimilarly, Q | P^2 + 1, quotient S(x) monic quadratic.\\n\\nBut hard.\\nNote that since P | Q^2 + 1, then every root of P is a root of Q^2 + 1, so Q(r)^2 = -1 for each root r of P.\\nSimilarly, for each root s of Q, P(s)^2 = -1.\\n\\nSo let roots of P be r1, r2 (counting multiplicity).\\nThen for each ri, Q(ri)^2 = -1 ⇒ Q(ri) = ±i.\\nSimilarly, for each root sj of Q, P(sj) = ±i.\\n\\nSuppose P has a root r, then Q(r) = i or -i.\\nSimilarly, if Q has root s, P(s) = i or -i.\\n\\nNow, since P and Q are quadratic, two roots each.\\n\\nSuppose P has roots r1, r2.\\nThen Q(r1) = ε1 i, Q(r2) = ε2 i, where εj = ±1.\\nSimilarly, if Q has roots s1, s2, then P(s1) = δ1 i, P(s2) = δ2 i, δj=±1.\\n\\nNow, Q is determined by its values, but we have interpolation.\\nNote that Q(x) - ε i has root at r if Q(r)=ε i.\\nBut not necessarily, because different signs.\\n\\nConsider the difference.\\nSuppose that for all roots r of P, Q(r) = i.\\nThen Q(x) - i has roots at r1,r2, so since deg 2, Q(x) - i = k (x-r1)(x-r2) = k P(x).\\nBut P is monic, so if k≠0, then Q(x) = k P(x) + i.\\nBut Q is monic degree 2, P is monic degree 2, so k must be 1, then Q(x) = P(x) + i.\\nSimilarly, if Q(r) = -i for all r, then Q(x) = P(x) - i.\\nBut could be mixed: one i, one -i.\\n\\nCase 1: Q takes same value at both roots of P.\\nSubcase 1a: Q(r1) = Q(r2) = i.\\nThen as above, Q(x) - i is divisible by P(x), since P has simple roots? But could have multiple root.\\nEven with multiple root, if r1=r2, and Q(r1)=i, then (x-r1)^2 divides Q(x)-i? Not necessarily, only if derivative also matches.\\nFor example, if P has double root r, then for Q(r)^2 = -1, so Q(r)=±i, but no condition on derivative.\\nBut for Q(x) - i to be divisible by (x-r)^2, we need Q(r)=i and Q'(r)=0.\\nBut we don't have that.\\nSo in general, if P has a root r of multiplicity m, then since P | Q^2 +1, and Q^2 +1 must have r as root of multiplicity at least m.\\nBut Q^2 +1, its derivative is 2Q Q', so if Q(r) = i ≠0, then derivative at r is 2i Q'(r), which may not be zero, so multiplicity exactly 1 unless Q'(r)=0.\\nBut if m>1, we need multiplicity at least m>1, so must have Q'(r)=0.\\nSimilarly if Q(r)=-i.\\n\\nSo if P has a multiple root, say r with mult >=2, then at r, Q(r)^2 = -1, and since mult_P(r) >=2, we need (Q^2 +1) has root of mult >=2 at r, so derivative must vanish: 2Q(r)Q'(r)=0.\\nSince Q(r)=±i ≠0, we need Q'(r)=0.\\nSimilarly for Q.\\n\\nBut let's first assume distinct roots.\\n\\nTo simplify, suppose P and Q are such that they satisfy a functional equation.\\n\\nNotice that in the linear case, we had P(x) = x+a, Q(x)=x+a+i or x+a-i.\\nThen Q(x) = P(x) + i or P(x) - i.\\nCheck: if Q = P + i, then Q^2 +1 = (P+i)^2 +1 = P^2 + 2iP -1 +1 = P^2 + 2iP.\\nDoes P divide this? Yes, since P^2 and 2iP are both divisible by P.\\nSimilarly, P^2 +1, does Q divide it? Q = P+i, so P^2 +1 divided by P+i.\\nNote that P^2 +1 = (P+i)(P-i) + something? (P+i)(P-i) = P^2 +1? No: (P+i)(P-i) = P^2 - i^2 = P^2 - (-1) = P^2 +1. Exactly!\\nSo P^2 +1 = (P+i)(P-i).\\nSo if Q = P + i, then Q divides P^2 +1? Only if P-i is polynomial, but Q = P+i, so unless P-i is multiple, but in general, (P+i) divides (P+i)(P-i), yes, quotient is P-i.\\nBut P-i is a polynomial, yes.\\nSo indeed, if Q = P + i, then:\\n- P divides Q^2 +1 = (P+i)^2 +1 = P^2 + 2iP -1 +1 = P^2 + 2iP = P(P + 2i), so yes.\\n- Q = P+i divides P^2 +1 = (P+i)(P-i), so yes.\\nSimilarly, if Q = P - i, then Q^2 +1 = (P-i)^2 +1 = P^2 - 2iP -1 +1 = P^2 - 2iP = P(P - 2i), divisible by P.\\nP^2 +1 = (P+i)(P-i), so if Q=P-i, then Q divides it.\\nPerfect.\\n\\nNow, what if P is constant? P=1, then Q=P+i=1+i, but is Q monic? 1+i is constant, but leading coefficient should be 1, but 1+i ≠1, so not monic unless i=0. So only if constant is 1, but 1+i ≠1. So not.\\nBut earlier we had (1,1). How does that fit?\\nIf P=1, Q=1, then Q ≠ P±i.\\nBut check directly: P divides Q^2+1: 1 divides 1+1=2, yes.\\nQ divides P^2+1: 1 divides 1+1=2, yes.\\nSo it works, but not of the form Q=P±i.\\n\\nNow, are there others?\\nSuppose Q = P + i.\\nThen as above, it works for any monic P.\\nBut Q must be monic: if P is monic of degree n, then Q = P + i is also monic of same degree, since i is constant.\\nSimilarly for Q = P - i.\\nNow, check the conditions:\\nAs above, P divides Q^2 +1: if Q=P+i, Q^2+1 = (P+i)^2 +1 = P^2 + 2iP -1 +1 = P^2 + 2iP = P(P + 2i), so yes, divisible by P.\\nQ divides P^2 +1: P^2 +1 = (P+i)(P-i) = Q (P - i), so yes, since P-i is a polynomial.\\nSimilarly for Q = P - i: Q^2 +1 = (P-i)^2 +1 = P^2 - 2iP + i^2 +1 = P^2 - 2iP -1 +1 = P^2 - 2iP = P(P - 2i), divisible by P.\\nP^2 +1 = (P+i)(P-i) = (P+i) Q, so divisible by Q.\\nSo for any monic polynomial P, setting Q = P + i or Q = P - i gives a solution.\\nBut also, we could have P and Q swapped.\\nFor example, if I set Q first, then P = Q + i, etc.\\nBut in this case, if I take P arbitrary monic, Q = P + i, then it's covered.\\nBut also, the pair (Q,P) would be (P+i, P), but that's different.\\nFor example, take P(x)=x, Q(x)=x+i.\\nThen pair (x, x+i).\\nIf I take P(x)=x+i, Q(x)=x, then pair (x+i, x).\\nIs this covered in the above? If I set P=x+i, Q=P - i = (x+i) - i = x, yes, so Q = P - i.\\nSo both are covered: when Q = P + i or Q = P - i.\\n\\nBut what about (1,1)?\\nIf P=1, Q=1, is 1 = 1 + i? No. 1=1-i? No.\\nSo not covered.\\nBut (1,1) works.\\nAre there others like that?\\nSuppose P and Q are both constant.\\nMonic constant polynomials: must be 1, since leading coefficient is the constant.\\nSo only possibility is P=1, Q=1.\\nCheck: as before, works.\\nNow, is there a pair where P and Q are not related by shift by i?\\nFor example, suppose P(x) = x^2, monic.\\nThen if Q = P + i = x^2 + i, then should work.\\nCheck: P divides Q^2 +1? Q^2 +1 = (x^2 + i)^2 +1 = x^4 + 2i x^2 -1 +1 = x^4 + 2i x^2 = x^2 (x^2 + 2i) = P (P + 2i), so yes.\\nQ divides P^2 +1? P^2 +1 = (x^2)^2 +1 = x^4 +1.\\nQ = x^2 + i, does it divide x^4 +1?\\nCompute: divide x^4 +1 by x^2 + i.\\nx^4 +1 = (x^2 + i)(x^2 - i) ? (x^2 + i)(x^2 - i) = x^4 - i x^2 + i x^2 - i^2 = x^4 - (-1) = x^4 +1. Yes!\\nSo x^4 +1 = (x^2 + i)(x^2 - i) = Q (x^2 - i), so yes.\\nGood.\\n\\nNow, back to (1,1). Can we include it?\\nNotice that if we allow P constant, but in Q=P±i, we get non-monic unless i=0.\\nBut (1,1) is extra.\\nIs there a symmetric pair?\\nAnother thought: suppose P = i, but not monic, since leading coefficient i ≠1.\\nNot allowed.\\n\\nPerhaps when P and Q are such that P^2 +1 and Q^2 +1 are related.\\nAnother idea: from the conditions, since P | Q^2 +1 and Q | P^2 +1, then P divides Q^2 +1, so P divides any combination.\\nIn particular, consider that P divides Q^2 +1, and Q divides P^2 +1, so P divides (P^2 +1)^2 +1? Not helpful.\\nNote that since Q | P^2 +1, then P^2 +1 = Q R for some polynomial R.\\nSimilarly, Q^2 +1 = P S for some S.\\nThen substitute.\\nBut complicated.\\n\\nFrom the root perspective: for each root r of P, Q(r)^2 = -1, so Q(r) = ±i.\\nSimilarly for roots of Q.\\nIn the case where Q = P + i, then for a root r of P, P(r)=0, so Q(r)=0 + i = i, so always i, not -i.\\nSimilarly, if Q=P-i, Q(r)=-i.\\nBut could we have mixed signs?\\nFor example, suppose P has two roots, and Q takes i at one and -i at the other.\\nSay P(r1)=0, Q(r1)=i; P(r2)=0, Q(r2)=-i.\\nThen Q(x) - i has root at r1, Q(x) + i has root at r2.\\nSo (Q(x) - i)(Q(x) + i) = Q(x)^2 +1 has roots at r1 and r2.\\nBut P has roots r1,r2, and P | Q^2 +1, which is satisfied since Q^2 +1 vanishes at r1,r2.\\nBut we need P divides Q^2 +1, which requires that the multiplicity is sufficient, but if roots are simple, and Q^2 +1 has simple roots there, then as long as no other issues, it might be ok, but Q^2 +1 may have higher degree.\\nSuppose P is quadratic with roots r1,r2, and Q^2 +1 vanishes at r1,r2, so (x-r1)(x-r2) = P(x) divides Q^2 +1 only if Q^2 +1 is multiple of P, but deg Q^2 +1 = 2 deg Q, so if deg Q =1, then deg=2, same as P, so possible.\\nTry deg P=2, deg Q=1.\\nEarlier we tried and failed, but let's see.\\nLet Q be linear, monic: Q(x)=x+b.\\nThen Q^2 +1 = (x+b)^2 +1 = x^2 + 2b x + b^2 +1.\\nNow P divides this, and deg P=2, so P must be equal to this, since both monic degree 2.\\nSo P(x) = x^2 + 2b x + b^2 +1.\\nNow, Q | P^2 +1.\\nP^2 +1 is degree 4, Q degree 1, so Q divides it iff P(-b)^2 +1 =0.\\nCompute P(-b) = (-b)^2 + 2b(-b) + b^2 +1 = b^2 - 2b^2 + b^2 +1 = 0 +1 =1.\\nThen P(-b)^2 +1 =1 +1=2≠0. Same as before. So no.\\n\\nIf deg Q=2, same as P.\\nSuppose P and Q both degree 2.\\nSuppose P has roots r1,r2.\\nThen Q(r1)=ε1 i, Q(r2)=ε2 i, with εj=±1.\\nSimilarly, if Q has roots s1,s2, P(s1)=δ1 i, P(s2)=δ2 i.\\n\\nSuppose ε1 =1, ε2=-1.\\nThen Q(r1)=i, Q(r2)=-i.\\nNow Q is quadratic, so we can interpolate: we want Q(r1)=i, Q(r2)=-i.\\nThere is a unique quadratic? No, many quadratics passing through two points.\\nA quadratic is determined by three parameters.\\nSo many possibilities.\\nSet r1=0, r2=1 for simplicity, by shifting.\\nSince the problem is over complexes, and translation invariant? Let's see.\\nSuppose we compose with affine transformation.\\nBut perhaps assume P(x) = x(x-1) = x^2 - x, monic.\\nThen roots at 0 and 1.\\nNeed Q(0) = ε1 i, Q(1) = ε2 i.\\nSuppose ε1=1, ε2=-1, so Q(0)=i, Q(1)=-i.\\nLet Q(x) = x^2 + c x + d.\\nThen Q(0)=d=i.\\nQ(1)=1 + c + d = -i.\\nSo 1 + c + i = -i ⇒ c = -1 -i -i = -1 -2i.\\nSo Q(x) = x^2 - (1+2i)x + i.\\nNow, P | Q^2 +1? Since P has roots 0,1, and we set Q(0)^2 +1 = i^2 +1 = -1+1=0, Q(1)^2 +1 = (-i)^2 +1 = -1+1=0, so yes, Q^2 +1 vanishes at x=0,1, so divisible by x(x-1)=P(x), since P is square-free.\\nNow, need Q | P^2 +1.\\nP(x) = x^2 - x, so P^2 +1 = (x^2 - x)^2 +1 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 +1.\\nNow, does Q divide this?\\nQ(x) = x^2 - (1+2i)x + i.\\nPerform division.\\nDivide x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 +1 by x^2 - (1+2i)x + i.\\nFirst, x^4 / x^2 = x^2.\\nMultiply: x^2 * (x^2 - (1+2i)x + i) = x^4 - (1+2i)x^3 + i x^2.\\nSubtract: (x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 +1) - (x^4 - (1+2i)x^3 + i x^2) = [-2x^3 + (1+2i)x^3] + [x^2 - i x^2] +1 = (-2 +1 +2i)x^3 + (1 - i)x^2 +1 = (-1 + 2i)x^3 + (1 - i)x^2 +1.\\nNow, (-1 + 2i)x^3 / x^2 = (-1 + 2i)x.\\nMultiply: (-1 + 2i)x * (x^2 - (1+2i)x + i) = (-1+2i)x^3 - (-1+2i)(1+2i)x^2 + (-1+2i)i x.\\nCompute coefficients:\\n(-1+2i)(1+2i) = -1*1 + (-1)(2i) + 2i*1 + 2i*2i = -1 -2i + 2i + 4i^2 = -1 + 0i -4 = -5.\\n(-1+2i)i = -i + 2i^2 = -i -2.\\nSo multiply: (-1+2i)x^3 - (-5)x^2 + (-2 - i)x = (-1+2i)x^3 + 5x^2 + (-2 - i)x.\\nNow subtract from current: [(-1 + 2i)x^3 + (1 - i)x^2 +1] - [(-1+2i)x^3 + 5x^2 + (-2 - i)x] = (1 - i - 5)x^2 + (0 - (-2 - i))x +1 = (-4 - i)x^2 + (2 + i)x +1.\\nNow, divide (-4 - i)x^2 by x^2 = -4 - i.\\nMultiply: (-4 - i)(x^2 - (1+2i)x + i) = (-4-i)x^2 + (4+i)(1+2i)x - (4+i)i.\\nCompute (4+i)(1+2i) = 4*1 + 4*2i + i*1 + i*2i = 4 + 8i + i + 2i^2 = 4 + 9i -2 = 2 + 9i.\\n-(4+i)i = -4i - i^2 = -4i +1.\\nSo: (-4-i)x^2 + (2+9i)x + (1 - 4i).\\nNow subtract: [(-4 - i)x^2 + (2 + i)x +1] - [(-4-i)x^2 + (2+9i)x + (1 - 4i)] = (2+i -2 -9i)x + (1 -1 +4i) = (-8i)x + 4i.\\nNot zero! Remainder -8i x + 4i ≠0.\\nSo not divisible.\\nThus, does not work.\\nIf I choose other signs, likely same.\\nSuppose both same sign, say Q(0)=i, Q(1)=i.\\nThen d=i, 1+c+d=i ⇒ 1+c+i=i ⇒ c=-1.\\nSo Q(x)=x^2 -x + i.\\nThen P(x)=x^2 -x.\\nNow P | Q^2 +1? At roots: Q(0)=i, i^2+1=-1+1=0; Q(1)=1-1+i=i, same, so yes.\\nNow Q | P^2 +1? P^2 +1 = (x^2 -x)^2 +1 = x^4 -2x^3 +x^2 +1.\\nDivide by Q(x)=x^2 -x + i.\\nx^4 / x^2 = x^2.\\nx^2*(x^2 -x + i) = x^4 -x^3 + i x^2.\\nSubtract: (x^4 -2x^3 +x^2 +1) - (x^4 -x^3 + i x^2) = -2x^3 + x^3 + x^2 - i x^2 +1 = -x^3 + (1-i)x^2 +1.\\n- x^3 / x^2 = -x.\\n- x * (x^2 -x + i) = -x^3 + x^2 - i x.\\nSubtract: [-x^3 + (1-i)x^2 +1] - [-x^3 + x^2 - i x] = (1-i -1)x^2 + i x +1 = (-i)x^2 + i x +1.\\nNow -i x^2 / x^2 = -i.\\n- i * (x^2 -x + i) = -i x^2 + i x - i^2 = -i x^2 + i x +1.\\nSubtract: [-i x^2 + i x +1] - [-i x^2 + i x +1] =0.\\nOh! It divides, quotient is x^2 - x - i.\\nSo yes! Works.\\nNow, what is Q? Q(x)=x^2 -x + i.\\nP(x)=x^2 -x.\\nNow, is Q = P + i? P + i = x^2 -x + i, yes! Exactly.\\nSo Q = P + i.\\nSimilarly, if both -i, Q=P-i.\\nSo in this case, it reduces to the previous form.\\n\\nNow, what if multiple roots? Suppose P has double root.\\nSay P(x)=(x-a)^2.\\nThen since P | Q^2 +1, and P has double root at a, so Q^2 +1 must have double root at a, so Q(a)^2 +1 =0 and derivative 2Q(a)Q'(a)=0.\\nSince Q(a)^2 = -1 ≠0, so Q(a)≠0, thus Q'(a)=0.\\nSo Q(a)=±i, and Q'(a)=0.\\nSimilarly, now Q | P^2 +1.\\nP^2 +1 = (x-a)^4 +1.\\nQ is monic, and we have Q(a)=±i, Q'(a)=0.\\nSuppose deg Q = m.\\nThen Q | (x-a)^4 +1.\\nNow, (x-a)^4 +1 at x=a is 1 ≠0, so a is not a root of P^2 +1, but Q may not have root at a.\\nBut we need Q divides P^2 +1.\\nNow, since Q'(a)=0 and Q(a)=±i, so near a, Q(x) ≈ ±i + c (x-a)^2 for some c.\\nNow, P^2 +1 = (x-a)^4 +1.\\nFor Q to divide this, but deg Q unknown.\\nSuppose deg Q =2, since P is deg 2.\\nAssume Q monic quadratic: Q(x) = (x-b)(x-c) = x^2 - (b+c)x + bc.\\nBut we have Q(a) = ±i, Q'(a)=0.\\nQ'(x)=2x - (b+c), so Q'(a)=2a - (b+c)=0 ⇒ b+c=2a.\\nQ(a)=a^2 - (b+c)a + bc = a^2 - 2a^2 + bc = -a^2 + bc = ±i.\\nSo bc = a^2 ± i.\\nNow, Q | P^2 +1 = (x-a)^4 +1.\\nSince deg Q=2, deg P^2+1=4, so quotient quadratic.\\nBut we can check if Q divides it by seeing if roots of Q satisfy.\\nRoots b,c with b+c=2a, bc=a^2 ± i.\\nNow, P^2 +1 at x=b: (b-a)^4 +1.\\nNeed this to be 0? No, only if b is root, but not necessarily.\\nSince Q divides it, and Q(b)=0, so must have (P^2 +1)(b) =0.\\nSimilarly for c.\\nSo (b-a)^4 +1 =0, so (b-a)^4 = -1.\\nSimilarly (c-a)^4 = -1.\\nNow, b-a and c-a are numbers whose fourth power is -1.\\nSet u = b-a, v=c-a, then u^4 = -1, v^4 = -1.\\nAnd b+c=2a ⇒ (u+a) + (v+a) = 2a ⇒ u+v=0 ⇒ v=-u.\\nThen v^4 = (-u)^4 = u^4 = -1, good.\\nbc = (u+a)(v+a) = (u+a)(-u+a) = a^2 - u^2.\\nBut earlier bc = a^2 ± i.\\nSo a^2 - u^2 = a^2 ± i ⇒ -u^2 = ± i ⇒ u^2 = ∓ i.\\nBut u^4 = -1, and u^2 = w, say, then w^2 = -1, so w = ±i.\\nBut here u^2 = ∓ i, so either i or -i, which is ±i, so w = ±i, and w^2 = (±i)^2 = -1, yes.\\nSo possible.\\nFor example, u^2 = i or u^2 = -i.\\nSay u^2 = i, then u = ±√i, etc.\\nBut we have u^2 = ∓ i, from earlier.\\nSpecifically, from bc = a^2 ± i, and bc = a^2 - u^2, so -u^2 = ± i ⇒ u^2 = ∓ i.\\nAnd since u^4 = (u^2)^2 = (∓ i)^2 = (-1)*i^2 = (-1)(-1) =1? No!\\n(∓ i)^2 = (∓1)^2 i^2 = 1 * (-1) = -1. Yes! Because i^2 = -1.\\nSo (∓ i)^2 = (-1) * (∓1)^2, no: if u^2 = -i, then (u^2)^2 = (-i)^2 = (-i)(-i) = i^2 = -1.\\nSimilarly if u^2 = i, (i)^2 = -1.\\nSo u^4 = -1, satisfied.\\nSo possible.\\nNow, for example, set a=0 for simplicity.\\nThen b+c=0, so c=-b.\\nbc = -b^2 = ± i? From earlier, bc = a^2 ± i = ± i.\\nBut bc = b*(-b) = -b^2.\\nSo -b^2 = ± i ⇒ b^2 = ∓ i.\\nSay b^2 = -i, then b = ± (-i)^{1/2}.\\nNow, Q(x) = (x-b)(x+b) = x^2 - b^2 = x^2 - (-i) = x^2 + i? b^2 = -i, so Q(x) = x^2 - (b^2) = x^2 - (-i) = x^2 + i.\\nSince monic.\\nb^2 = -i, so Q(x) = x^2 - (sum) x + prod, sum b+c=0, prod bc = b(-b) = -b^2 = -(-i) = i.\\nSo Q(x) = x^2 + 0*x + i = x^2 + i.\\nP(x) = (x-0)^2 = x^2.\\nNow check conditions.\\nP divides Q^2 +1? Q^2 +1 = (x^2 + i)^2 +1 = x^4 + 2i x^2 -1 +1 = x^4 + 2i x^2 = x^2 (x^2 + 2i) = P (P + 2i), so yes.\\nQ divides P^2 +1? P^2 +1 = (x^2)^2 +1 = x^4 +1.\\nDoes x^2 + i divide x^4 +1?\\nAs before, x^4 +1 = (x^2 + i)(x^2 - i)? (x^2 + i)(x^2 - i) = x^4 - i x^2 + i x^2 - i^2 = x^4 - (-1) = x^4 +1. Yes!\\nSo x^4 +1 = (x^2 + i)(x^2 - i) = Q (x^2 - i), so yes.\\nAnd Q = x^2 + i, P = x^2, so Q = P + i.\\nAgain, same form!\\nIf we had chosen other sign, same.\\nSo even in multiple root case, it reduces to Q = P + i or Q = P - i.\\n\\nNow, what about the constant pair (1,1)?\\nHere P=1, Q=1.\\nIs there a way to include it?\\nNotice that if we try Q = P + i = 1 + i, but not monic.\\nBut (1,1) satisfies.\\nAre there other constant pairs? Only (1,1) since monic constant must be 1.\\nNow, is (1,1) of a different form?\\nSuppose we consider that in the relation, if P is constant 1, then Q must divide P^2 +1 =1+1=2, and monic, so if constant, Q=1 (since 1 is the only monic constant dividing 2? But 2 is constant, monic divisors: only 1, since if Q=c, monic means c=1, and 1 divides 2.\\nCould Q be nonconstant? But if Q nonconstant monic, divides 2? Only if 2=0, impossible. So only Q=1.\\nSimilarly, P=1.\\nSo only (1,1).\\nNow, in the form Q=P±i, we get solutions for any monic P, but Q not monic if P constant, except possibly if i=0.\\nBut (1,1) is extra.\\nHowever, notice that if we set P(x)=1, and Q(x)=1, it works, but not covered.\\nBut is there a pair where P and Q are both nonconstant and not differing by i?\\nSuppose P(x)=x, Q(x)=x.\\nThen P divides Q^2+1=x^2+1? At x=0, 0+1=1≠0, no.\\nOr P(x)=x, Q(x)=x+1, etc., unlikely.\\nSuppose that P and Q are such that P^2 +1 = c Q, but c must be constant, but leading coefficients: if deg P = deg Q, then c=1, so P^2 +1 = Q, but then Q = P^2 +1, then P divides Q^2 +1 = (P^2 +1)^2 +1 = P^4 + 2P^2 +1 +1 = P^4 + 2P^2 +2, so P divides this, so divides 2, so P constant, contradiction unless deg 0.\\nIf deg P < deg Q, but earlier inequalities.\\nFrom d ≤ 2e, e ≤ 2d.\\nSuppose d=0, e=0: then P=1,Q=1, works.\\nd=0,e>0: P=1, then Q divides P^2+1=2, so Q constant, contradiction.\\nSimilarly e=0,d>0: Q=1, P divides Q^2+1=1+1=2, so P constant, contradiction.\\nSo only when both constant or both positive degree.\\nNow for positive degree, we have the families Q=P+i and Q=P-i for any monic P of degree at least 1.\\nBut when degree 0, only (1,1).\\nBut in Q=P±i, if we allow P constant, we get non-monic Q.\\nBut notice that for P=1, if we could have Q such that, but no.\\nAnother pair: what if P=i, but not monic.\\nOr perhaps (P,Q) = (i,1), but not monic.\\nNo.\\nBut in the pair (1,1), it works.\\nNow, is there a symmetric pair like (i,i)? But not monic.\\nPerhaps we can list all pairs.\\nSo far, we have:\\n- P any monic polynomial, Q = P + i\\n- P any monic polynomial, Q = P - i\\n- and additionally (P,Q) = (1,1)\\nBut when P is nonconstant, Q=P±i is not 1, so no overlap.\\nBut is (1,1) included in some limit? No.\\nBut let's check if there are more.\\nSuppose that Q = P + i, but then (P,Q) is a pair.\\nSimilarly, we could have P = Q + i, but that would be different.\\nFor example, if P = Q + i, then Q = P - i, which is already included in the second family.\\nSo the two families cover all cases where |P - Q| = i in some sense.\\nBut (1,1) has P-Q=0.\\nNow, another thought: suppose that P and Q are both constant, only (1,1).\\nBut is there a pair where P and Q are related differently?\\nSuppose P(x) = x^2 + 1, Q(x) = x.\\nThen P divides Q^2 +1 = x^2 +1? Yes, equal.\\nQ divides P^2 +1 = (x^2+1)^2 +1 = x^4 + 2x^2 +1 +1 = x^4 + 2x^2 +2.\\nDoes x divide this? At x=0, 2≠0, no.\\nNot.\\nOr P(x)=x^2 +1, Q(x)=x^2 +1, then P divides Q^2+1=(x^2+1)^2 +1=x^4+2x^2+1+1=x^4+2x^2+2, not divisible by x^2+1? At root i, (i)^4 +2(i)^2 +2=1 -2 +2=1≠0, no.\\nBack.\\nPerhaps the only solutions are the ones we have.\\nBut in the family Q=P+i, when P=1, Q=1+i, not monic, so not included.\\nBut (1,1) is separate.\\nNow, is (1,1) the only exception?\\nWhat if we consider P(x)=i, but not monic.\\nNo.\\nAnother idea: suppose that P^2 +1 = k Q, and Q^2 +1 = m P, but with k,m constants, but leading coefficients may not match.\\nFor example, if deg P = deg Q, then k=1, m=1, so P^2 +1 = Q, Q^2 +1 = P, then P^2 +1 = Q, so (P^2 +1)^2 +1 = P, so P^4 + 2P^2 +1 +1 = P, so P^4 + 2P^2 - P +2=0, which for polynomial, only if constant, but then solve p^4 +2p^2 -p +2=0, but p=1: 1+2-1+2=4≠0, p=-1:1+2+1+2=6≠0, etc., no real, complex? But must be constant monic, so p=1, not satisfied.\\nSo no.\\nPerhaps k and m not constant.\\nBut complicated.\\nFrom the initial approach, perhaps all solutions are covered by Q=P±i for nonconstant P, and (1,1).\\nBut when P is constant 1, Q=P±i not valid.\\nBut is there a pair like (P,Q)=(i,0)? No, not monic.\\nPerhaps (P,Q) = (x, x), but doesn't work.\\nAnother pair: suppose P(x) = 2, but not monic.\\nNo.\\nOr perhaps when P and Q are associates, but monic, so same.\\nI think the only solutions are:\\n1. P any monic polynomial, Q = P + i\\n2. P any monic polynomial, Q = P - i\\n3. P = 1, Q = 1\\nBut in 1 and 2, when P is constant, Q is not monic, so we must exclude constant P in 1 and 2, or rather, only include when Q is monic, which requires that the constant term adjustment doesn't affect leading coefficient, which it doesn't, but the constant itself: for Q to be monic, if P is monic of degree n, Q=P±i is also monic of degree n, since ±i is constant. So for any monic P, Q=P±i is monic of same degree.\\nBut if P is constant, say P=c, monic means c=1, then Q=1±i, which is constant, but leading coefficient is 1±i ≠1, so not monic! Ah! That's the point.\\nFor a constant polynomial to be monic, it must be 1.\\nBut 1+i ≠1, so not monic.\\nTherefore, in the families Q=P+i and Q=P-i, when P is nonconstant, Q is monic (same degree, leading coefficient unchanged), but when P is constant, Q is constant but not 1, so not monic.\\nTherefore, for the families, we need deg P ≥ 1.\\nAdditionally, we have the pair where both are constant 1: (1,1).\\nNow, are there any other pairs?\\nFor example, is (i,i) a solution? But not monic.\\nOr (0,1): P=0, but not monic, and leading coefficient undefined or 0, not 1.\\nNo.\\nSuppose P(x)=x^2, Q(x)=x^2 + i, which is in the family.\\nWorks.\\nNow, is there a pair not in these?\\nSuppose P and Q are such that P divides Q^2+1 and Q divides P^2+1, but P - Q is not constant.\\nFor example, suppose P(x)=x, Q(x)=x+2i.\\nThen P divides Q^2+1? Q^2+1=(x+2i)^2 +1=x^2 +4i x -4 +1=x^2 +4i x -3.\\nAt x=0, -3≠0, so no.\\nOr P(x)=x, Q(x)=i, but Q not monic.\\nNo.\\nPerhaps P(x)=x^2 + x, Q(x)=x^2 + x + i, then Q=P+i, so in family.\\nSo probably the families cover all nonconstant cases.\\nBut in the pair (1,1), it works.\\nNow, is (1,1) the only constant pair? Yes.\\nBut notice that if we take P(x)=1, and try Q=1, works.\\nIs there a pair like (P,Q)=(1, i)? But Q not monic.\\nNo.\\nAnother thought: what if P(x) = -1, but not monic, since leading coefficient -1 ≠1.\\nNo.\\nSo only (1,1) for constants.\\nBut in the families, when we have Q=P±i, and P nonconstant, we get solutions.\\nBut also, the pair (Q,P) might be listed, but since we have both Q=P+i and Q=P-i, and P varies, it covers all.\\nFor example, the pair (x+i, x) is given by P=x+i, Q=P - i = x, so in the family Q=P-i with P=x+i.\\nSimilarly.\\nNow, is (1,1) included? No.\\nBut let's confirm if there are any other constant solutions or not.\\nSuppose both constant: P=c, Q=d, monic so c=1, d=1, and P divides Q^2+1: 1 divides 1+1=2, yes; Q divides P^2+1:1 divides 1+1=2, yes.\\nIf one constant one not, impossible as shown.\\nSo only additional pair is (1,1).\\nBut is (1,1) really not in the family? Suppose we allow P constant in Q=P+i, but then Q not monic.\\nUnless i=0, but no.\\nPerhaps we can write the answer as all pairs where Q = P + i or Q = P - i for some monic polynomial P, and the pair (1,1).\\nBut when P is such that P+i or P-i is 1, but P+i=1 implies P=1-i, not monic.\\nNo overlap.\\nBut notice that in (1,1), P and Q are equal, while in others, |P-Q|=|i|=1 in complex, but not constant difference.\\nAnother way: perhaps the pair (1,1) can be seen as a limiting case, but not.\\nMaybe there is another family.\\nSuppose that P^2 +1 = Q R, and Q^2 +1 = P S, but with R,S polynomials.\\nIn the working cases, for Q=P+i, then P^2 +1 = (P+i)(P-i) = Q (P-i), so R=P-i.\\nSimilarly, Q^2 +1 = (P+i)^2 +1 = P^2 + 2iP + i^2 +1 = P^2 + 2iP -1 +1 = P(P + 2i), so S=P+2i.\\nFor (1,1), P^2+1=1+1=2, Q=1, so 2 = 1 * 2, so R=2.\\nQ^2+1=1+1=2, P=1, so 2=1*2, S=2.\\nNow, is there a pair where, say, P and Q are both degree 0, only (1,1).\\nOr perhaps when P and Q are units, but in polynomials, units are nonzero constants, but monic only 1.\\nI think we have all.\\nBut let's see if (i, i) works: P=i, Q=i, but not monic. P^2+1 = -1+1=0, Q divides 0? Yes, but Q=i, and 0/i=0, but the issue is monic: leading coefficient i≠1.\\nSimilarly, if we scale, but monic fixes the leading coefficient.\\nSo only (1,1) for constants.\\nNow, for nonconstants, all covered by Q=P±i with P monic nonconstant.\\nBut when P is nonconstant monic, Q=P±i is also monic nonconstant, and works.\\nIs there a pair where P and Q are both nonconstant but not differing by a constant?\\nFor example, suppose P(x)=x^2, Q(x)=x.\\nThen P divides Q^2+1=x^2+1? x^2 divides x^2+1? No, remainder 1.\\nOr P(x)=x^2, Q(x)=x^2, then Q^2+1=x^4+1, P divides it? x^2 divides x^4+1? At x=0, 1≠0, no.\\nOr P(x)=x+1, Q(x)=x-1, then P divides Q^2+1=(x-1)^2 +1=x^2-2x+1+1=x^2-2x+2, at x=-1, 1+2+2=5≠0, no.\\nSo probably not.\\nThus, the complete set is:\\n- All pairs where Q = P + i and P is a monic polynomial of degree at least 1\\n- All pairs where Q = P - i and P is a monic polynomial of degree at least 1\\n- The pair P(x) = 1, Q(x) = 1\\nBut when degree at least 1, it's fine.\\nBut in the pair (1,1), it's degree 0.\\nNote that if we allow P to be any monic polynomial in the first two families, but then for P constant, Q not monic, so we must restrict to deg P ≥ 1.\\nWe could say: all pairs where either (P,Q) = (1,1) or Q = P + i or Q = P - i with P monic nonconstant.\\nBut when Q = P + i, and P nonconstant monic, then Q is determined.\\nSimilarly.\\nIs the pair (1,1) the only one missing? What about if we have P = i, but no.\\nAnother pair: suppose P(x) = x^n for n≥1, Q(x) = x^n + i, works.\\nAll good.\\nBut in the answer, we need to list all pairs.\\nNotice that in the pair (1,1), if we compute P^2 +1 =2, Q^2+1=2, and each divides the other's something, but not directly related.\\nPerhaps we can include it by noting that when P is constant, only (1,1), but otherwise the shift.\\nBut I think it's fine.\\nNow, for Problem 2.\\nProblem 2: Find all positive integers n such that there exist k≥2 positive rational numbers a1,...,ak with sum = product = n.\\nSo sum_{i=1}^k a_i = n, prod_{i=1}^k a_i = n, a_i >0 rational, k≥2.\\nWe need to find all such n.\\nFirst, since a_i rational positive, and sum and product are integers (n integer), but a_i rational.\\nBy scaling or substitution.\\nNote that for fixed k, we can consider.\\nStart with small k.\\nk=2: then a1 + a2 = n, a1 a2 = n.\\nSo a1 and a2 are roots of t^2 - n t + n =0.\\nDiscriminant d= n^2 - 4n = n(n-4).\\nFor real roots, d≥0, so n≤0 or n≥4, but n positive integer, so n≥4.\\nRoots are [n ± sqrt(n(n-4))]/2.\\nThese need to be positive rational.\\nSince sum and product are rational, roots are rational iff discriminant is perfect square.\\nSo n(n-4) must be perfect square.\\nLet d = n(n-4) = m^2 for some integer m≥0.\\nn and n-4 are integers differing by 4.\\nSet d = n^2 - 4n.\\nSo n^2 - 4n - m^2 =0.\\nOr (n-2)^2 - m^2 = 4.\\nSo (n-2)^2 - m^2 = 4.\\nSo ((n-2) - m)((n-2) + m) = 4.\\nLet u = n-2 - m, v= n-2 + m, u v =4, v>u, and since m≥0, v ≥ |u|, but u,v integers, u v=4.\\nPossible pairs (u,v): (1,4), (2,2), (4,1), (-1,-4), (-2,-2), (-4,-1), and ( -1, -4) already, also (1,4), etc.\\nSince n positive integer, n≥4, so n-2≥2>0.\\nm≥0, so v = n-2 + m ≥ n-2 ≥2 >0, and u = n-2 - m, could be positive or negative.\\nNow u v =4.\\nCases:\\n1. u=1, v=4: then adding: 2(n-2) = u+v=5, so n-2=2.5, not integer.\\n2. u=2, v=2: then 2(n-2)=4, n-2=2, n=4.\\nThen m = (v-u)/2? From u=n-2-m=2, v=n-2+m=2, so adding: 2(n-2)=4, n-2=2, n=4.\\nSubtracting: 2m=0, m=0.\\nThen discriminant m^2=0, so roots [4±0]/2=2,2.\\nSo a1=a2=2, sum=4, product=4, good.\\n3. u=4, v=1: but v=1, u=4, but v should be greater than u since m≥0, v=n-2+m ≥ n-2-m=u, equality only if m=0, but here v=1<4=u, contradiction.\\nSimilarly, negative:\\nu=-1, v=-4: then u+v= -5, 2(n-2)= -5, n-2=-2.5, not integer.\\nu=-2, v=-2: 2(n-2)= -4, n-2=-2, n=0, not positive.\\nu=-4, v=-1: u+v=-5, same as above.\\nAlso u= -1, v= -4, already.\\nAnd u=1,v=4 not integer.\\nBut also u=4,v=1 invalid.\\nWhat about u= -4, v= -1? Same as above.\\nAnd u=1/2, but u,v must be integers since n,m integers.\\nn integer, m integer, so u,v integers.\\nSo only solution for k=2 is n=4.\\nBut are there others? u= -1, v= -4: n-2 = (u+v)/2 = (-5)/2 not int.\\nOr u=4,v=1: n-2 = (4+1)/2=2.5 not int.\\nBut what if m=0, n(n-4)=0, so n=0 or 4, n=4 as above.\\nOr n=1,2,3: for n=3, d=3(-1)= -3<0, no real.\\nn=2, d=2(-2)= -4<0.\\nn=1, d=1(-3)= -3<0.\\nn=5, d=5*1=5, not square.\\nn=6,6*2=12, not square.\\nn=8,8*4=32, not square.\\nn=9,9*5=45, no.\\nn=12,12*8=96, no.\\nn=16,16*12=192, no.\\nn=0, not positive.\\nBut earlier only n=4 for k=2.\\nBut k≥2, so higher k possible.\\nk=3: a1+a2+a3=n, a1a2a3=n, ai>0 rational.\\nBy AM-GM, (a1+a2+a3)/3 ≥ (a1a2a3)^{1/3}, so n/3 ≥ n^{1/3}.\\nLet x=n^{1/3}>0, then x^3 /3 ≥ x, so x^3 - 3x ≥0, x(x^2 -3)≥0, so x≥√3, since x>0.\\nThus n = x^3 ≥ 3√3 ≈ 5.196, so n≥6 since integer.\\nNow, we need to find such rationals.\\nSince ai rational, and symmetric, perhaps assume they are equal, but if a1=a2=a3=a, then 3a=n, a^3=n, so a^3=3a, a^2=3, a=√3, not rational.\\nSo not equal.\\nNow, fix n, solve.\\nSince ai rational, let me set bi = ai, but perhaps clear denominators.\\nNote that the elementary symmetric sums.\\nLet s1=a1+a2+a3=n, s3=a1a2a3=n, s2=a1a2+a1a3+a2a3.\\nThen the cubic is t^3 - s1 t^2 + s2 t - s3 =0.\\nBut we don't know s2.\\nFrom the identity (a1+a2+a3)^2 = a1^2 + a2^2 + a3^2 + 2 s2.\\nBut not helpful.\\nAssume two are equal.\\nOr use the fact that for fixed sum and product, the variance.\\nSince ai>0 rational, and sum and product equal to n, perhaps set one variable.\\nSuppose we let a3 be a parameter.\\nThen a1+a2 = n - a3, a1 a2 = n / a3, since a1a2a3=n.\\nThen a1 and a2 are roots of t^2 - (n - a3) t + n/a3 =0.\\nDiscriminant d= (n - a3)^2 - 4 n / a3.\\nMust be non-negative, and since a1,a2 real, d≥0, and for them to be rational, d must be perfect square of rational, but since coefficients rational (if a3 rational), d must be square of rational.\\nBut a3 is rational positive.\\nSo let a3 = p/q in lowest terms, but perhaps set a3 = r, rational.\\nThen d = (n - r)^2 - 4n / r.\\nMust be a perfect square of a rational number.\\nAnd d≥0.\\nMoreover, a1 and a2 must be positive, so sum n-r >0, product n/r >0, which is true since n>0,r>0.\\nAlso, since k=3≥2, and ai>0.\\nNow, d = (n - r)^2 - 4n / r = n^2 - 2n r + r^2 - 4n / r.\\nWrite as d = r^2 - 2n r + n^2 - 4n / r.\\nTo combine, multiply by r: consider r d = r^3 - 2n r^2 + n^2 r - 4n.\\nBut d must be square of rational, so r d must be such that when divided by r, it's square, but messy.\\nSince r rational, let r = a/b with a,b integers, gcd(a,b)=1, b>0.\\nThen d = (n - a/b)^2 - 4n / (a/b) = (n - a/b)^2 - 4n b / a.\\n= [ (n b - a)^2 / b^2 ] - 4n b / a.\\n= [ (n b - a)^2 a - 4n b^3 ] / (a b^2) \\nBetter:\\nd = \\frac{(n b - a)^2}{b^2} - \\frac{4n b}{a} = \\frac{ a (n b - a)^2 - 4n b^3 }{a b^2}\\nNumerator: a (n^2 b^2 - 2n a b + a^2) - 4n b^3 = a n^2 b^2 - 2n a^2 b + a^3 - 4n b^3\\n= n^2 a b^2 - 2n a^2 b + a^3 - 4n b^3\\nThis must be such that d is a perfect square of a rational, so the entire expression d must be a square in Q.\\nSince denominator is a b^2, and numerator is integer, d = num / (a b^2), and this must be a square of a rational.\\nSo num / (a b^2) = (c/d)^2 for some integers c,d, but better: since it's a rational number, and must be a perfect square, so in reduced terms, numerator and denominator are both perfect squares.\\nBut it's complicated.\\nFor small n, we can try.\\nn≥6.\\nTry n=6.\\nThen s1=6, s3=6.\\nLet r=a3 rational >0.\\nThen d = (6 - r)^2 - 24 / r.\\nMust be ≥0 and perfect square of rational.\\nAlso, a1,a2 >0, so n-r=6-r>0, r<6, and n/r=6/r>0, obvious.\\nr>0.\\nd = (6-r)^2 - 24/r.\\nLet f(r) = (6-r)^2 - 24/r.\\nFor r>0, r<6.\\nFind r such that f(r) ≥0 and f(r) is a perfect square of a rational.\\nTry r=1: f(1)=(6-1)^2 -24/1=25-24=1=1^2, good!\\nSo d=1, perfect square.\\nThen a1,a2 are roots of t^2 - (6-1)t + 6/1 = t^2 -5t +6=0, so (t-2)(t-3)=0, so a1=2,a2=3.\\na3=r=1.\\nSum:2+3+1=6, product:2*3*1=6, good.\\nAnd all rational.\\nSo n=6 works with k=3.\\nNow n=7.\\nf(r)=(7-r)^2 - 28/r.\\nr<7, r>0.\\nTry r=1: (7-1)^2 -28/1=36-28=8, not a perfect square (of rational? 8=(2√2)^2, but not rational square. A perfect square of a rational means (p/q)^2 for integers p,q, so must be square of rational, so in lowest terms, numerator and denominator are both perfect squares. 8=8/1, 8 not perfect square, so no.\\nr=2: (7-2)^2 -28/2=25 -14=11, not square.\\nr=4: (7-4)^2 -28/4=9 -7=2, not square.\\nr=7/2=3.5: (7-3.5)^2 -28/3.5= (3.5)^2 - 8= 12.25 -8=4.25=17/4, is 17/4 a perfect square? 17 not square, so no.\\nr=1/2: (7-0.5)^2 -28/(0.5)= (6.5)^2 - 56= 42.25 -56= -13.75<0, no.\\nr=3: (7-3)^2 -28/3=16 - 9.333=6.666=20/3, not square.\\nr=6: (7-6)^2 -28/6=1 - 14/3= (3-14)/3=-11/3<0.\\nr=5: (7-5)^2 -28/5=4 - 5.6= -1.6<0.\\nr=4.5: (7-4.5)^2 -28/4.5= (2.5)^2 - 6.222...=6.25 - 6.222=0.02777>0, but 1/36? Compute: 28/4.5=28/(9/2)=56/9≈6.222, 2.5^2=6.25, so 6.25 - 56/9= (56.25 - 56)/9? Better: (5/2)^2 - 56/9= 25/4 - 56/9= (225 - 224)/36=1/36=(1/6)^2, oh! Perfect square.\\nSo d=1/36, which is (1/6)^2, good.\\nThen a1,a2 roots of t^2 - (7 - 4.5)t + 7 / 4.5 = t^2 - 2.5 t + 14/9? n/a3=7/(9/2)=14/9? a3=r=9/2? Earlier r=4.5=9/2.\\nBut r=a3=9/2, then sum a1+a2=n - a3=7 - 9/2=14/2 - 9/2=5/2.\\nProduct a1 a2 = n / a3 =7 / (9/2) =14/9.\\nSo equation t^2 - (5/2)t + 14/9=0.\\nDiscriminant d= (5/2)^2 - 4*14/9= 25/4 - 56/9= (225 - 224)/36=1/36, as above.\\nRoots [5/2 ± 1/6]/2? Standard formula: [sum ± sqrt(disc)] / 2 = [5/2 ± 1/6] / 2? No.\\nRoots are [s ± sqrt(d)] / 2, where s is sum, d discriminant.\\nHere sum is 5/2, disc=1/36, so roots [ 5/2 ± 1/6 ] / 2? No, the formula is [ -b ± sqrt(b^2 -4ac) ] / (2a), here a=1,b= -5/2? Equation is t^2 - (5/2)t + 14/9=0, so roots [ 5/2 ± sqrt(1/36) ] / 2 = [5/2 ± 1/6] / 2.\\n[5/2 + 1/6]/2 = [15/6 + 1/6]/2 = (16/6)/2 = 16/12 = 4/3.\\n[5/2 - 1/6]/2 = [15/6 - 1/6]/2 = (14/6)/2 = 14/12 = 7/6.\\nSo a1=4/3, a2=7/6, a3=9/2.\\nSum: 4/3 + 7/6 + 9/2 = 8/6 + 7/6 + 27/6 = 42/6=7.\\nProduct: (4/3)*(7/6)*(9/2) = (4*7*9)/(3*6*2) = (252)/(36) = 7.

For example, is (x+i, x+2i) the same as some other? Probably not.\\nNote that in the pair (P, P+i), Q=P+i, so P=Q-i, so it's covered.\\nThe pair (1,1) is extra.\\nWe could include constant P, but then Q not monic.\\nSo the complete set is all pairs where either P and Q are both identically 1, or Q = P + i, or Q = P - i, with P a monic polynomial (and automatically Q monic if P is, for nonconstant, but for constant P, only if P=1, but then Q=1±i≠1, not monic, so we must specify that for the shift, P is nonconstant, or simply state that P is any monic polynomial, but then for P constant, Q not monic, so the pair is invalid, so in practice, only when deg P ≥1 for the shifts.\\nTo write neatly.\\nNotice that in all cases except (1,1), we have that P and Q differ by a constant, specifically ±i.\\nAnd for (1,1), they are equal.\\nBut are there pairs where they differ by other constants? For example, Q=P+c, then P divides (P+c)^2 +1 = P^2 +2cP +c^2 +1, so P divides c^2 +1, since P divides P^2 and 2cP.\\nSimilarly, Q divides P^2 +1, Q=P+c, so P+c divides P^2 +1.\\nNow P divides c^2 +1, and c^2 +1 is constant, so P must be constant, but if P constant monic, P=1, then 1 divides c^2 +1, always, and Q=1+c, must be monic, so 1+c=1, c=0, then Q=1, so (1,1), and c=0, c^2+1=1, P=1 divides 1.\\nOtherwise, if c≠0, Q=1+c≠1, not monic.\\nSo only when c=0, giving (1,1), or when P nonconstant, but then P divides c^2+1, constant, so only if c^2+1=0, so c=±i, which gives the other cases.\\nExactly!\\nSo the only possibilities are when Q - P = c, constant, and then c^2 +1 =0 or (P,Q)=(1,1) with c=0.\\nBut when c=±i, c^2+1= -1+1=0, so P divides 0, always true, and then the other condition gives that Q divides P^2+1, which as before holds.\\nWhen c=0, Q=P, then P divides P^2+1, so P divides 1, so P constant, monic, so P=1, Q=1.\\nSo all cases covered.\\nTherefore, the pairs are:\\n- P any monic polynomial, Q = P + i\\n- P any monic polynomial, Q = P - i\\n- P = 1, Q = 1\\nBut when P is constant in the first two, Q not monic, so to avoid confusion, we can say:\\nThe pairs are all those where Q = P + i or Q = P - i for some monic polynomial P, and the pair where P(x) = 1 and Q(x) = 1.\\nBut when P is nonconstant, Q=P±i is fine, and for P constant, only the (1,1) pair.\\nSince when P is constant monic, P=1, and Q=P±i=1±i not 1, so not included, so no overlap.\\nSo in the answer, we can list.\\nFor Problem 2, all positive integers n except 1,2,3,5.\\nNow to box the answer.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"All pairs are (P(x), Q(x)) = (1, 1) or (P(x), P(x) + i) or (P(x), P(x) - i) for some monic polynomial P(x).\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"All positive integers n except 1, 2, 3, 5\"\n}",
