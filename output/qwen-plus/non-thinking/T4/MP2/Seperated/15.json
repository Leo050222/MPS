Therefore, if $ f_n(x) = 2x $, then $ 2x > 0 \\\\Rightarrow x > 0 $. So we only consider $ x > 0 $.\\n\\nWe proceed by induction to find a pattern or prove that $ x $ must satisfy a certain value for all $ n $.\\n\\nTry small values of $ n $:\\n\\nCase $ n = 1 $:\\n\\n$ f_1(x) = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 48} = 2x $\\n\\nSquare both sides:\\n\\n$ x^2 + 48 = 4x^2 \\\\Rightarrow 3x^2 = 48 \\\\Rightarrow x^2 = 16 \\\\Rightarrow x = 4 $ (since $ x > 0 $)\\n\\nSo for $ n = 1 $, the only solution is $ x = 4 $.\\n\\nNow suppose for some $ n $, the only solution to $ f_n(x) = 2x $ is $ x = 4 $. Let's check $ n+1 $.\\n\\nAssume $ f_n(4) = 8 $? Wait — we need to compute actual values at $ x = 4 $ to see if the pattern holds.\\n\\nCompute $ f_n(4) $ recursively:\\n\\n- $ f_1(4) = \\\\sqrt{4^2 + 48} = \\\\sqrt{16 + 48} = \\\\sqrt{64} = 8 = 2 \\\\cdot 4 $\\n- $ f_2(4) = \\\\sqrt{4^2 + 6f_1(4)} = \\\\sqrt{16 + 6\\\\cdot8} = \\\\sqrt{16 + 48} = \\\\sqrt{64} = 8 $\\n- $ f_3(4) = \\\\sqrt{16 + 6\\\\cdot8} = \\\\sqrt{64} = 8 $\\n\\nSo it appears that $ f_n(4) = 8 = 2\\\\cdot4 $ for all $ n $. So $ x = 4 $ is always a solution.\\n\\nNow, is it the only solution?\\n\\nWe prove by induction that $ f_n(x) = 2x $ has only solution $ x = 4 $.\\n\\nBase case $ n = 1 $: already done, only solution is $ x = 4 $.\\n\\nInductive step: assume that $ f_n(x) = 2x $ has only solution $ x = 4 $. But actually, we don't need that — instead, we want to solve $ f_{n+1}(x) = 2x $, and show that only $ x = 4 $ works.\\n\\nBut better: define a sequence $ a_n = f_n(x) $, for fixed $ x $, and suppose $ f_{n+1}(x) = 2x $, i.e.,\\n\\n$ \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 6f_n(x)} = 2x $\\n\\nThen squaring:\\n\\n$ x^2 + 6f_n(x) = 4x^2 \\\\Rightarrow 6f_n(x) = 3x^2 \\\\Rightarrow f_n(x) = \\\\frac{x^2}{2} $\\n\\nBut we also have $ f_{n+1}(x) = 2x $, so this implies $ f_n(x) = \\\\frac{x^2}{2} $\\n\\nBut from earlier, $ f_n(x) = 2x $ would imply $ x = 4 $, but here it's different.\\n\\nWait — we are solving $ f_n(x) = 2x $. Suppose $ f_n(x) = 2x $. We want to find all such $ x $ for each $ n $.\\n\\nBut from above, if $ f_{n+1}(x) = 2x $, then $ f_n(x) = \\\\frac{x^2}{2} $\\n\\nBut if we also had $ f_n(x) = 2x $, then $ 2x = \\\\frac{x^2}{2} \\\\Rightarrow 4x = x^2 \\\\Rightarrow x^2 - 4x = 0 \\\\Rightarrow x(x - 4) = 0 \\\\Rightarrow x = 0 $ or $ x = 4 $\\n\\nBut $ x = 0 $: check $ f_1(0) = \\\\sqrt{0 + 48} = \\\\sqrt{48} > 0 $, but $ 2x = 0 $, so not equal. Also, $ f_n(0) > 0 $, so $ f_n(0) \\\\neq 0 $. So $ x > 0 $, and $ x = 0 $ invalid.\\n\\nBut in the implication: if $ f_{n+1}(x) = 2x $, then $ f_n(x) = x^2 / 2 $. For $ f_{n+1}(x) = 2x $ to hold, we need $ f_n(x) = x^2 / 2 $. But unless $ x = 4 $, this may not be consistent.\\n\\nBut we know that at $ x = 4 $, $ f_n(4) = 8 $ for all $ n $, as shown by recurrence:\\n\\nLet’s prove by induction that $ f_n(4) = 8 $ for all $ n $.\\n\\n- Base: $ f_1(4) = \\\\sqrt{16 + 48} = \\\\sqrt{64} = 8 $\\n- Assume $ f_n(4) = 8 $, then $ f_{n+1}(4) = \\\\sqrt{16 + 6*8} = \\\\sqrt{16 + 48} = \\\\sqrt{64} = 8 $\\n\\nSo yes, $ f_n(4) = 8 = 2*4 $ for all $ n $. So $ x = 4 $ is always a solution.\\n\\nNow, is there any other solution?\\n\\nSuppose $ f_n(x) = 2x $. We will show by induction that the only solution is $ x = 4 $.\\n\\nBase case $ n = 1 $: $ \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 48} = 2x \\\\Rightarrow x^2 + 48 = 4x^2 \\\\Rightarrow 3x^2 = 48 \\\\Rightarrow x^2 = 16 \\\\Rightarrow x = 4 $ (positive)\\n\\nAssume that for some $ n $, the only solution to $ f_n(x) = 2x $ is $ x = 4 $.\\n\\nNow consider $ f_{n+1}(x) = 2x $:\\n\\n$ \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 6f_n(x)} = 2x $\\n\\nSquare both sides:\\n\\n$ x^2 + 6f_n(x) = 4x^2 \\\\Rightarrow 6f_n(x) = 3x^2 \\\\Rightarrow f_n(x) = \\\\frac{x^2}{2} $\\n\\nSo for $ f_{n+1}(x) = 2x $, we must have $ f_n(x) = \\\\frac{x^2}{2} $\\n\\nBut we are not assuming $ f_n(x) = 2x $, so this is a different condition.\\n\\nBut we want to find $ x $ such that $ f_{n+1}(x) = 2x $, which requires $ f_n(x) = x^2 / 2 $\\n\\nNow, define $ g_n(x) = f_n(x) $. We know $ f_n(x) $ is increasing in $ x $, probably.\\n\\nAlternatively, suppose $ x > 0 $, and define the function.\\n\\nBut note: if $ f_{n+1}(x) = 2x $, then $ f_n(x) = x^2 / 2 $\\n\\nBut $ f_n(x) $ is defined recursively and is always at least $ \\\\sqrt{x^2} = |x| = x $ (since $ x > 0 $), and grows.\\n\\nBut let’s suppose that $ f_n(x) = x^2 / 2 $, and we know $ f_n(x) \\\\geq \\\\text{something} $\\n\\nBut perhaps try to see if $ x = 4 $ is the only solution by contradiction.\\n\\nAlternatively, suppose that for each $ n $, the equation $ f_n(x) = 2x $ has only solution $ x = 4 $.\\n\\nWe proved for $ n = 1 $.\\n\\nSuppose it's true for $ n $. Now for $ n+1 $:\\n\\nSuppose $ f_{n+1}(x) = 2x $. Then as above, $ f_n(x) = x^2 / 2 $\\n\\nBut we also know from the inductive hypothesis that $ f_n(x) = 2x $ only when $ x = 4 $, but that doesn’t directly help.\\n\\nBut at $ x = 4 $, $ f_n(4) = 8 $, and $ x^2 / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8 $, so equality holds.\\n\\nNow suppose there is another $ x > 0 $, $ x \\\\neq 4 $, such that $ f_{n+1}(x) = 2x $. Then $ f_n(x) = x^2 / 2 $\\n\\nBut we can analyze the behavior of $ f_n(x) $.\\n\\nNote that $ f_1(x) = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 48} $\\n\\n$ f_2(x) = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 6\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 48}} $\\n\\nThis is complicated.\\n\\nBut observe: define a constant sequence at $ x = 4 $: $ f_n(4) = 8 $\\n\\nSuppose $ x < 4 $. Then $ f_1(x) = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 48} > \\\\sqrt{x^2} = x $, but compare to $ 2x $:\\n\\nAt $ x = 4 $, $ f_1(4) = 8 = 2x $\\nFor $ x < 4 $, say $ x = 3 $: $ f_1(3) = \\\\sqrt{9 + 48} = \\\\sqrt{57} \\\\approx 7.55 > 6 = 2x $\\n$ x = 2 $: $ f_1(2) = \\\\sqrt{4 + 48} = \\\\sqrt{52} \\\\approx 7.21 > 4 $\\n$ x = 1 $: $ \\\\sqrt{1 + 48} = 7 > 2 $\\nAs $ x \\\\to 0^+ $, $ f_1(x) \\\\to \\\\sqrt{48} \\\\approx 6.93 > 0 $\\nAs $ x \\\\to \\\\infty $, $ f_1(x) \\\\sim |x| = x $, while $ 2x \\\\to \\\\infty $, but $ x < 2x $, so $ f_1(x) \\\\sim x < 2x $, so for large $ x $, $ f_1(x) < 2x $\\nIndeed, $ \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 48} < 2x $ when $ x^2 + 48 < 4x^2 \\\\Rightarrow 48 < 3x^2 \\\\Rightarrow x^2 > 16 \\\\Rightarrow x > 4 $\\nSo:\\n- For $ x < 4 $, $ f_1(x) > 2x $\\n- At $ x = 4 $, equal\\n- For $ x > 4 $, $ f_1(x) < 2x $\\nAnd since both are continuous, only one solution at $ x = 4 $\\n\\nNow for $ f_2(x) = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 6f_1(x)} $\\nSet $ f_2(x) = 2x $\\nThen $ \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 6f_1(x)} = 2x \\\\Rightarrow x^2 + 6f_1(x) = 4x^2 \\\\Rightarrow f_1(x) = \\\\frac{x^2}{2} $\\nSo we need $ \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 48} = \\\\frac{x^2}{2} $\\nSet $ y = x^2 > 0 $:\\n$ \\\\sqrt{y + 48} = \\\\frac{y}{2} $\\nSquare both sides: $ y + 48 = \\\\frac{y^2}{4} \\\\Rightarrow 4y + 192 = y^2 \\\\Rightarrow y^2 - 4y - 192 = 0 $\\nDiscriminant: $ 16 + 768 = 784 = 28^2 $\\n$ y = [4 ± 28]/2 = 32/2=16 or -24/2=-12 $ → only $ y = 16 $, so $ x^2 = 16 $, $ x = 4 $ (positive)\\nCheck: $ \\\\sqrt{16 + 48} = \\\\sqrt{64} = 8 $, $ x^2 / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8 $, yes.\\nSo only solution for $ f_2(x) = 2x $ is $ x = 4 $\\nSimilarly, for $ f_3(x) = 2x $, we need $ f_2(x) = x^2 / 2 $\\nBut $ f_2(x) = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 6f_1(x)} $\\nSet equal to $ x^2 / 2 $:\\n$ \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 6\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 48}} = \\\\frac{x^2}{2} $\\nAt $ x = 4 $: left = $ f_2(4) = 8 $, right = 16/2=8, good.\\nSuppose there is another solution. But we can prove by induction that the only solution to $ f_n(x) = 2x $ is $ x = 4 $\\nBase: $ n = 1 $, done.\\nAssume for $ n $, only solution is $ x = 4 $\\nNow for $ n+1 $: $ f_{n+1}(x) = 2x $ implies $ f_n(x) = x^2 / 2 $\\nDefine $ h(x) = f_n(x) - x^2 / 2 $\\nWe know at $ x = 4 $, $ f_n(4) = 8 $, $ x^2/2 = 8 $, so equal.\\nNow, suppose $ x < 4 $. We suspect $ f_n(x) > x^2 / 2 $? Not necessarily.\\nBut from the recurrence, perhaps $ f_n(x) $ is convex or something.\\nAlternatively, since the functional recurrence is increasing, and we have equality only at $ x = 4 $, and strict inequality elsewhere, perhaps by induction $ f_n(x) = x^2 / 2 $ only at $ x = 4 $\\nBut we need to show that $ f_n(x) = x^2 / 2 $ has only solution $ x = 4 $\\nBut from the inductive construction, perhaps.\\nNote that $ f_n(x) $ is defined as nested radicals, and likely strictly concave or something, but hard.\\nBut from the first two cases, only solution is $ x = 4 $, and since the pattern continues, and at each step the equation reduces to a previous one that only has solution at $ x = 4 $, likely it's always true.\\nMoreover, since $ f_n(4) = 8 $ for all $ n $, and $ 2x = 8 $ when $ x = 4 $, it's always a solution.\\nTo confirm uniqueness, suppose for contradiction that for some $ n $, there is $ x \\\\neq 4 $ such that $ f_n(x) = 2x $\\nBut from the recurrence, it would require $ f_{n-1}(x) = x^2 / 2 $, and so on, down to $ f_1(x) = x^2 / 2 $, which gives $ \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 48} = x^2 / 2 $, which we solved and only solution is $ x = 4 $\\nYes!\\nSo for $ f_n(x) = 2x $, by repeated substitution:\\n$ f_n(x) = 2x \\\\Rightarrow f_{n-1}(x) = x^2 / 2 $\\nThen $ f_{n-1}(x) = x^2 / 2 \\\\Rightarrow $ but $ f_{n-1}(x) = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 6f_{n-2}(x)} = x^2 / 2 $\\nSo $ x^2 + 6f_{n-2}(x) = x^4 / 4 \\\\Rightarrow f_{n-2}(x) = \\\\frac{x^4 / 4 - x^2}{6} $\\nThis gets messy.\\nBut from $ f_{n}(x) = 2x $, we get $ f_{n-1}(x) = x^2 / 2 $\\nNow, $ f_{n-1}(x) = 2x $ would imply $ x = 4 $, but here it's equal to $ x^2 / 2 $\\nBut to have $ f_{n-1}(x) = x^2 / 2 $, and we know that $ f_{n-1}(x) $ is defined recursively.\\nHowever, for $ n = 2 $, we had $ f_1(x) = x^2 / 2 $, which led to $ \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 48} = x^2 / 2 $, only solution $ x = 4 $\\nFor $ n = 3 $: $ f_3(x) = 2x \\\\Rightarrow f_2(x) = x^2 / 2 $\\nBut $ f_2(x) = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 6f_1(x)} = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 6\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 48}} $\\nSet equal to $ x^2 / 2 $\\nThen $ \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 6\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 48}} = \\\\frac{x^2}{2} $\\nSquare both sides:\\n$ x^2 + 6\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 48} = \\\\frac{x^4}{4} $\\nLet $ y = x^2 $:\\n$ \\\\sqrt{y + 48} = \\\\frac{y^2 / 4 - y}{6} = \\\\frac{y^2 - 4y}{24} $\\nLeft side ≥0, so right side ≥0 ⇒ $ y^2 - 4y ≥ 0 ⇒ y(y-4) ≥ 0 ⇒ y ≥ 4 $\\nNow square again:\\n$ y + 48 = \\\\left( \\\\frac{y^2 - 4y}{24} \\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{(y^2 - 4y)^2}{576} $\\nMultiply both sides by 576:\\n$ 576y + 48*576 = (y^2 - 4y)^2 $\\nCompute: 48*576 = let's see, 50*576=28800, minus 2*576=1152, so 27648\\nBetter: 48*576 = 48*(600-24)=48*600 - 48*24=28800 - 1152=27648\\nAnd 576y\\nSo:\\n$ (y^2 - 4y)^2 - 576y - 27648 = 0 $\\nLet $ z = y $, expand:\\n$ (y^4 - 8y^3 + 16y^2) - 576y - 27648 = 0 $\\n$ y^4 - 8y^3 + 16y^2 - 576y - 27648 = 0 $\\nNow, we know $ y = 16 $ should be a root (since x=4, y=16)\\nPlug y=16: 16^4 = 65536? 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536\\n-8*4096 = -32768\\n+16*256=4096\\n-576*16= -9216\\n-27648\\nSum: 65536 -32768 = 32768; +4096=36864; -9216=27648; -27648=0. Yes.\\nSo (y-16) is a factor.\\nDivide the polynomial by (y-16).\\nSince it's a quartic, and we expect only one positive root, but let's factor.\\nUse polynomial division or synthetic division.\\ny=16:\\nCoefficients: 1 (y^4) -8 (y^3) +16 (y^2) -576 (y) -27648\\nSynthetic division with root 16:\\nBring down 1\\nMultiply by 16: 16\\nAdd to next coefficient: -8+16=8\\nMultiply by 16: 128\\nAdd to next: 16+128=144\\nMultiply by 16: 2304\\nAdd to next: -576+2304=1728\\nMultiply by 16: 27648\\nAdd to last: -27648+27648=0\\nSo quotient is y^3 + 8y^2 + 144y + 1728\\nNow set y^3 + 8y^2 + 144y + 1728 = 0\\nPossible rational roots: factors of 1728 over 1, try negative since all coefficients positive.\\nTry y=-8: (-512) + 8*64=512, +144*(-8)=-1152, +1728 → -512+512=0; -1152+1728=576 ≠0\\ny=-12: (-1728) + 8*144=1152, +144*(-12)=-1728, +1728 → -1728+1152=-576; -1728=-2304; +1728=-576 ≠0\\ny=-16: -4096 + 8*256=2048 → -4096+2048=-2048; +144*(-16)=-2304 → -4352; +1728=-2624 ≠0\\nAll terms positive for y>0, no positive roots. For y<0, but earlier we had y≥4 for the square root to be defined in the equation (since right side must be non-negative), so y≥4, and for y>0, the cubic is positive, so no other real roots in domain.\\nThus only solution y=16, x=4.\\nSo for n=3, only solution is x=4.\\nBy similar reasoning, for each n, the equation f_n(x)=2x reduces through recursion to an equation that ultimately depends on f_1(x) and forces x=4.\\nMoreover, since at each step the derived equation in x has only solution x=4, by induction, for all n, the only real solution is x=4.\\n\\nTherefore, for each positive integer n, the only real solution to f_n(x) = 2x is x = 4.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe have spectators placing themselves on the plane with conditions:\\n(i) KP_n ≥ 10 m\\n(ii) P_m P_n ≥ 1 m for all m < n\\n(iii) P_n is chosen as close as possible to K, i.e., minimize KP_n subject to (i) and (ii)\\n\\nA1 chooses any point on circle radius 10.\\nA2 chooses a point on the circle (or outside?) but minimizes distance to K, so since there are points on the circle at least 1m from P1, A2 will choose such a point on the circle, because going outside would increase distance.\\nSimilarly, all A_n will stay on or near the circle of radius 10, but as more people come, they might be forced to go outward.\\n\\nThe key is packing: we are packing disks of radius 0.5 m around each person, since each pair must be at least 1m apart, so centers at least 1m apart, so disjoint disks of radius 0.5m.\\nAlso, each center is at least 10m from K.\\n\\nThe area available within distance R from K is πR^2, but excluding the inner disk of radius 10, so area between 10 and R is π(R^2 - 100)\\nEach spectator requires area of a disk of radius 0.5, area π(0.5)^2 = π/4\\nBut due to packing efficiency, in 2D, the densest packing of circles has density π/(2√3) ≈ 0.9069, so effective area per circle is (π/4) / (π/(2√3)) = (1/4)*(2√3/π)*π wait no.\\nArea per circle in hexagonal packing is (√3/2) * d^2 for diameter d, but here minimum distance between centers is 1m, so in hexagonal lattice, area per point is (√3/2) * (1)^2 = √3/2 ≈ 0.866\\nWhile area of each exclusion disk is π(0.5)^2 = π/4 ≈ 0.785, but the Voronoi cell area is about 0.866.\\nSo the number of points that can be placed within distance R from K is at most approximately the area divided by area per point:\\nNumber n ≤ [π(R^2 - 10^2)] / (√3/2) + C, but roughly proportional to R^2\\nMore precisely, the maximum number of points with min distance 1 and all at least 10 from origin, within distance R, satisfies n ≤ C (R^2 - 100) for some C.\\nBut in our case, the points are added sequentially, each time choosing the closest possible to K.\\nThis is similar to a greedy algorithm for packing.\\nIt is known that such a process will fill the annuli, and the radius grows like √n.\\nSpecifically, after n points, the minimal possible max radius is about √(n / π) times something, but here it's the opposite.\\nAfter n points, what is KP_n?\\nSince each new point is placed as close as possible to K, it will be on the boundary of the forbidden regions.\\nThe set of allowed points is outside the disk of radius 10, and outside disks of radius 0.5 around each existing point.\\nSo the closest point to K in the allowed set.\\nInitially, on the circle r=10.\\nAs points are added, they form a sort of circular layer.\\nIn the optimal packing, points are arranged in concentric circles.\\nWith greedy placement, it should be similar.\\nThe number of points that can be placed at distance approximately r from K is about 2πr / 1 = 2πr, since circumference, and each takes arc length about 1m.\\nTo place n points, the radius r must satisfy that the total \\\"capacity\\\" up to r is at least n.\\nThe area argument: the area within r is π(r^2 - 100), and number of points ~ area / (area per point) ~ c (r^2 - 100)\\nSo r^2 ~ n / c + 100, so for large n, r ~ √n\\nThus KP_n, the distance for the n-th point, should be on the order of √n\\nMoreover, since it's minimized at each step, it should grow like √n\\nNow look at the options:\\n(A) KP_n bounded between constants — impossible, as n increases, more points, must go farther out.\\n(B) c1 √n ≤ KP_n ≤ c2 √n — this seems plausible\\n(C) linear in n — too fast\\n(D) quadratic — even faster\\nSo likely (B)\\nBut is it tight?\\nFor example, after many points, the inner layers are filled, and new points must go to larger radii.\\nThe minimal radius for the n-th point: since the disk of radius R can contain at most O(R^2) points with min distance 1, so to have n points, we need R such that c R^2 ≥ n, so R ≥ c' √n\\nSimilarly, with efficient packing, we can achieve R = O(√n)\\nIn the greedy algorithm, since it places each point as close as possible, it should achieve KP_n = Θ(√n)\\nThat is, there exist c1, c2 >0 such that c1 √n ≤ KP_n ≤ c2 √n for all n\\nThe lower bound: because the ball of radius KP_n must contain n points with min distance 1, all outside radius 10, so the area argument gives that the area π(KP_n^2 - 100) must be at least c n for some c>0, so KP_n^2 ≥ 100 + c n ≥ c n, so KP_n ≥ √c √n\\nUpper bound: since the greedy choice might not be optimal, but in practice, it fills the space efficiently. It can be shown that the covering radius or something, but intuitively, the points will be packed in a disk of radius O(√n), and since each new point is placed near the current boundary, KP_n should be O(√n)\\nMore rigorously, the final configuration after n points has diameter O(√n), and since points are added in order, the n-th point might be on the boundary, so KP_n = O(√n)\\nAnd from lower bound, Ω(√n)\\nThus Θ(√n)\\nMoreover, the constants can be chosen uniformly, regardless of choices, because even if players choose adversarially among ties, the growth rate is still √n\\nFor example, if all choose points on a ray, but condition (iii) forces them to minimize distance to K, so they cannot go far out unnecessarily.\\nSuppose first point at (10,0)\\nSecond point: can choose any point at least 1m away, on or outside r=10. The closest to K are on the circle r=10, at angular distance such that chordal distance ≥1.\\nChordal distance 2*10*sin(θ/2) ≥1 ⇒ sin(θ/2) ≥ 1/20 ⇒ θ/2 ≥ arcsin(0.05)≈0.05 rad, so θ≥0.1 rad\\nSo can choose at angle 0.1, so still on r=10\\nSimilarly, many points can be placed on r=10, up to about 2π / 0.1 ≈ 60 points? More precisely, number is floor(2π / θ_min) where θ_min from chord 1=2*10*sin(θ/2) ⇒ sin(θ/2)=0.05 ⇒ θ≈0.100167 rad, so number ≈ 2π / 0.100167 ≈ 62.7, so about 62 points on the first circle.\\nAfter that, no more room on r=10, so next point must go to r>10.\\nThe closest point to K not within 0.5m of any existing point.\\nWith 62 points on circle r=10, the gaps between them, the closest point might be at a gap, at distance slightly more than 10.\\nIn fact, the medial axis, but roughly, the distance to K for a point in the gap: the minimal distance is achieved at the midpoint of two adjacent points.\\nTwo points at (10,0) and (10 cos θ, 10 sin θ) with θ≈0.1 rad\\nMidpoint direction: angle θ/2, distance from origin: the point on the bisector at distance r such that distance to each point is at least 0.5? No, the forbidden region is disk of radius 0.5 around each.\\nSo the closest allowed point to K in the gap is along the angle bisector, at distance r where the distance to the nearest point is exactly 0.5 (for minimal r).\\nLet A and B be two adjacent points on r=10, distance d apart, here d≈1 (since min distance 1, and they are close).\\nActually, the chordal distance is at least 1, and for efficiency, approximately 1.\\nSet |AB|=1.\\nThen, the point P on the angle bisector, distance r from K, distance to A is s.\\nBy law of cosines: s^2 = r^2 + 10^2 - 2*r*10*cos(φ) where φ is half the angle at K.\\nAngle AKB is α, with 2*10*sin(α/2)=1 ⇒ sin(α/2)=1/20 ⇒ α/2 ≈ 0.05 rad, so α≈0.1 rad\\nThen for P on bisector, angle between KP and KA is α/2 ≈0.05 rad\\nThen distance PA: PA^2 = r^2 + 10^2 - 2*r*10*cos(α/2)\\nCos(α/2)≈ cos(0.05)≈1 - (0.05)^2/2≈0.99875\\nWe want PA ≥ 0.5, and minimize r.\\nSo PA^2 ≥ 0.25\\nr^2 + 100 - 20r * 0.99875 ≥ 0.25\\nr^2 - 19.975 r + 99.75 ≥ 0\\nSolve equality: r = [19.975 ± √(19.975^2 - 4*99.75)] / 2\\nCompute discriminant: 19.975^2 ≈ 399.000625, 4*99.75=399, so diff≈0.000625, sqrt≈0.025\\nSo r≈ [19.975 ± 0.025]/2\\nr≈20/2=10 or 19.95/2=9.975\\nThe quadratic r^2 -19.975r +99.75 opens upwards, so ≥0 when r≤9.975 or r≥10\\nBut r≥10 from (i), so r≥10\\nBut at r=10, PA^2 = 100 + 100 - 200*0.99875 = 200 - 199.75 = 0.25, so PA=0.5\\nBut the condition is P_m P_n ≥1, so distance between points must be at least 1, so the open disk of radius 0.5 is forbidden, so distance >0.5? No, the distance must be at least 1, so the closed disk of radius 0.5 around each point is forbidden? \\nCondition (ii): P_m P_n ≥1, so the distance is at least 1, so the open ball of radius 1 around each point? No, the set {P: |P - P_m| < 1} is forbidden for new points, but since it's closed inequality, |P - P_m| ≥1, so the closed exterior.\\nSo the point P must satisfy |P - P_m| ≥1 for all m<n.\\nSo the forbidden region is the closed disk of radius 1 around each P_m? No: |P - P_m| ≥1 means P is outside the open disk of radius 1, but since it's closed, it includes the boundary.\\n|P - P_m| ≥1 means distance at least 1, so P is in the closure of the complement of the open disk of radius 1.\\nBut for the inequality, equality is allowed: if |P - P_m| =1, it's allowed.\\nSo the forbidden region is the open disk of radius 1? No: if |P - P_m| <1, it's forbidden; if ≥1, allowed.\\nSo the allowed set is |P| ≥10 and |P - P_m| ≥1 for all m.\\nSo the closed set.\\nNow, at the midpoint of two points A and B with |A-B|=1, the point P on the bisector at distance r from K.\\nWhen r=10, and angle α, we have |P - A| = ?\\nIn triangle KAP, KA=10, KP=10, angle AKP=α/2\\nSo |P - A|^2 = 10^2 + 10^2 - 2*10*10*cos(α/2) = 200(1 - cos(α/2))\\nWith α/2 ≈0.05, cos(0.05)≈0.99875, so 1 - cos≈0.00125, so |P-A|^2≈200*0.00125=0.25, so |P-A|=0.5\\nBut we need |P - A| ≥1, but 0.5 <1, so not allowed.\\nSo at r=10, in the gap, the distance to nearest point is 0.5 <1, so forbidden.\\nSo P must be farther out.\\nSet |P - A| =1\\nThen |P - A|^2 = r^2 + 10^2 - 2*r*10*cos(α/2) =1\\nSo r^2 - 20 r cos(α/2) + 100 =1\\nr^2 - 20r * 0.99875 + 99 =0\\nr^2 - 19.975r + 99 =0\\nDiscriminant: 19.975^2 - 396 = 399.000625 - 396 = 3.000625\\nsqrt≈1.7323 (since √3≈1.732)\\nr = [19.975 ± 1.7323]/2\\nr≈ (21.7073)/2≈10.85365 or (18.2427)/2≈9.12135\\nTake r≥10, so r≈10.854\\nSo the closest point is at distance about 10.85 m from K.\\nAfter placing more points, the radius increases.\\nFor larger n, when the first layer is full, second layer starts at higher radius.\\nIn general, the k-th layer at radius r_k, with number of points proportional to r_k.\\nTotal points up to layer k is sum of circumferences, so about integral of r dr, so n ~ r^2, thus r ~ √n\\nTherefore, the distance KP_n for the n-th point is on the order of √n.\\nMoreover, since the packing density is bounded, there are constants such that c1 √n ≤ KP_n ≤ c2 √n for all n.\\nThe upper bound: even in worst case, the greedy choice won't go much farther than necessary. Since the optimal packing has radius O(√n), and greedy is competitive, KP_n = O(√n)\\nLower bound: as argued, by area, KP_n = Ω(√n)\\nSo (B) is correct.\\n(A) is false because KP_n → ∞ as n→∞\\n(C) and (D) grow faster than necessary.\\nSo answer is (B)\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"B\"\n}",
