Let's think algebraically.\\n\\nWe need:\\n\\n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 = k² for some integer k.\\n\\nLet’s denote:\\n\\n(2n² + 3n + 1)/6 = k²\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n2n² + 3n + 1 = 6k²\\n\\nMultiply both sides by 8 to complete the square:\\n\\n16n² + 24n + 8 = 48k²\\n\\n(4n + 3)² - 1 = 48k²\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n(4n + 3)² - 48k² = 1\\n\\nThis is a Pell equation:\\n\\nx² - 48y² = 1, where x = 4n + 3, y = k\\n\\nWe solve this Pell equation.\\n\\nThe fundamental solution of x² - 48y² = 1:\\n\\nsqrt(48) ≈ 6.928, continued fraction expansion...\\nBut easier: try small solutions.\\n\\nx=1: 1 - 48y² = 1 → y=0 → trivial\\nx=7: 49 - 48y² = 1 → 48 = 48y² → y²=1 → yes!\\nSo x=7, y=1 is a solution.\\n\\nBut x = 4n + 3 = 7 → 4n = 4 → n=1 → but n>1, so discard.\\n\\nNext solution of Pell equation x² - 48y² = 1 can be found by powers of fundamental solution.\\n\\nFundamental solution is (x₁,y₁) = (7,1)\\n\\nSolutions are given by:\\n\\nx_k + y_k√48 = (7 + √48)^k\\n\\nNext solution: k=2:\\n\\n(7 + √48)² = 49 + 14√48 + 48 = 97 + 14√48\\n\\nSo x₂ = 97, y₂ = 14\\n\\nCheck: 97² = 9409, 48×14² = 48×196 = 9408 → 9409 - 9408 = 1 → yes.\\n\\nSo x = 97 = 4n + 3 → 4n = 94 → n = 23.5 → not integer\\n\\nWait! 94 not divisible by 4 → invalid.\\n\\nNext solution: k=3:\\n\\n(7 + √48)^3 = (7 + √48)(97 + 14√48) = 7×97 + 7×14√48 + 97√48 + 14×48 = \\n= 679 + (98 + 97)√48 + 672? Wait:\\nBetter:\\n= 7*97 = 679\\n7*14√48 = 98√48\\n√48*97 = 97√48\\n√48*14√48 = 14*48 = 672\\nSo total: (679 + 672) + (98 + 97)√48 = 1351 + 195√48\\n\\nSo x₃ = 1351, y₃ = 195\\n\\nCheck: 1351² - 48×195² = ?\\nBut assume correct.\\nNow x = 1351 = 4n + 3 → 4n = 1348 → n = 337\\n\\nIs this integer? Yes.\\n\\nBut is there a smaller solution?\\n\\nWe had k=1: n=1 → too small\\nk=2: n=23.5 → invalid\\nk=3: n=337\\n\\nAre there other solutions?\\n\\nBut maybe I missed a smaller solution.\\n\\nWait — perhaps try more values manually.\\n\\nAlternatively, recall that known result: the smallest n > 1 is 337.\\n\\nLet me verify for n=337:\\n\\nSum of squares = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 = 337×338×675 / 6\\n\\nFirst, compute S = (n+1)(2n+1)/6 = 338 × 675 / 6\\n\\n338 / 2 = 169, 6 / 2 = 3 → (169 × 675) / 3\\n\\n675 / 3 = 225 → 169 × 225\\n\\n169×225: 170×225 = 38250, minus 225 = 38025\\n\\nIs 38025 a perfect square?\\nsqrt(38025): 195² = (200-5)² = 40000 - 2000 + 25 = 38025 → yes!\\nSo RMS = sqrt(38025) = 195 → integer.\\n\\nAnd n=337.\\n\\nIs there any smaller n>1?\\n\\nFrom Pell equation, next solution after (7,1) is (97,14), giving n=(97-3)/4=94/4=23.5 not integer\\nThen (1351,195) → n=1348/4=337\\n\\nSo yes, 337 is the smallest integer n>1 satisfying the condition.\\n\\nAnswer 1: 337\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe are told that there exists a degree 5 polynomial P such that if z^5 + 2004z = 1, then P(z²) = 0.\\n\\nWe are to compute P(1)/P(-1).\\n\\nLet’s understand.\\n\\nGiven: z^5 + 2004z - 1 = 0 ⇒ P(z²) = 0\\n\\nSo for every root z of the equation z^5 + 2004z = 1, we have that z² is a root of P(x).\\n\\nLet f(z) = z^5 + 2004z - 1 = 0\\n\\nThis is a degree 5 polynomial, so 5 roots (complex numbers).\\n\\nFor each root z_i, w_i = z_i² is a root of P(x).\\n\\nBut multiple z_i might give same z_i².\\n\\nP has degree 5, and we get 5 values w_i = z_i², but possibly with repetitions.\\n\\nBut P is degree 5, so it can have at most 5 roots. Since we have 5 values (counting multiplicity?), and P vanishes on them, likely these w_i are the roots of P, possibly with multiplicities.\\n\\nBut could two different z_i give same z_i²? Only if z_j = -z_i, but let’s see.\\n\\nSuppose z is a root: z^5 + 2004z = 1\\nThen (-z)^5 + 2004(-z) = -z^5 - 2004z = -(z^5 + 2004z) = -1 ≠ 1\\nSo -z is not a root. Therefore, all z_i are distinct from their negatives, so z_i² ≠ z_j² unless z_i = ±z_j, but since -z_j not root, only if i=j.\\n\\nThus, the map z_i → z_i² is injective among the roots? Not necessarily — could have z_i² = z_j² with i≠j only if z_i = -z_j, but as above, if z_j is root, -z_j is not root, so z_i cannot be -z_j unless both roots, which they’re not.\\n\\nTherefore, all z_i² are distinct.\\n\\nHence, the five values w_i = z_i² are distinct, and P(w_i)=0, and P is degree 5, so P(x) = c(x - w_1)(x - w_2)...(x - w_5) for some constant c.\\n\\nNow, we are to compute P(1)/P(-1)\\n\\nSo P(1) = c ∏(1 - w_i) = c ∏(1 - z_i²)\\nP(-1) = c ∏(-1 - w_i) = c ∏(-1 - z_i²)\\n\\nSo ratio:\\nP(1)/P(-1) = [∏(1 - z_i²)] / [∏(-1 - z_i²)] = ∏ [ (1 - z_i²) / (-1 - z_i²) ]\\n\\nNote: (1 - z²)/(-1 - z²) = (1 - z²)/-(1 + z²) = - (1 - z²)/(1 + z²)\\n\\nSo:\\nP(1)/P(-1) = ∏_{i=1}^5 [ - (1 - z_i²)/(1 + z_i²) ] = (-1)^5 ∏_{i=1}^5 (1 - z_i²)/(1 + z_i²) = - ∏ (1 - z_i²)/(1 + z_i²)\\n\\nNow, (1 - z²)/(1 + z²) = [(1 - z)(1 + z)] / (1 + z²)\\nBut perhaps better to write in terms of rational functions.\\n\\nNote that for each root z_i of f(z) = z^5 + 2004z - 1 = 0\\n\\nWe need to compute ∏ (1 - z_i²)/(1 + z_i²)\\n\\nBut this is a symmetric function of the roots, so can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials, i.e., coefficients of f.\\n\\nBut f(z) = z^5 + 0 z^4 + 0 z^3 + 0 z^2 + 2004 z - 1\\n\\nSo it's sparse.\\n\\nConsider the rational function:\\n\\nR(z) = (1 - z²)/(1 + z²)\\n\\nWe want ∏ R(z_i)\\n\\nBut note that ∏ R(z_i) = ∏ (1 - z_i²) / ∏ (1 + z_i²)\\n\\nNow, ∏ (1 - z_i²) and ∏ (1 + z_i²) can be related to resultant or values of polynomials.\\n\\nNote that ∏ (x - z_i) = f(z) = z^5 + 2004z - 1\\n\\nBut we want ∏ (1 - z_i²) = ∏ (1 - z_i²)\\n\\nSet u = z², but not helpful.\\n\\nNote that 1 - z² = (1 - z)(1 + z)\\nBut product over roots.\\n\\nRecall that for a polynomial f(z) = ∏ (z - z_i), then:\\n\\n∏ g(z_i) = resultant(f, g) / leading coefficient or something? Not exactly.\\n\\nActually, ∏ h(z_i) for a function h can be tricky.\\n\\nBut consider:\\n\\n∏ (a - z_i) = (-1)^n f(a) if monic? No.\\nf(z) = ∏ (z - z_i), so f(a) = ∏ (a - z_i)\\nYes!\\n\\nSo ∏ (a - z_i) = f(a)\\n\\nBut here we have ∏ (1 - z_i²), which is not linear.\\n\\nNote that 1 - z_i² = (1 - z_i)(1 + z_i)\\n\\nSo ∏_{i=1}^5 (1 - z_i²) = ∏ (1 - z_i) ∏ (1 + z_i) = f(1) * f(-1)?\\n\\nWait: f(1) = ∏ (1 - z_i)? No.\\nf(z) = ∏ (z - z_i), so f(1) = ∏ (1 - z_i)\\nf(-1) = ∏ (-1 - z_i) = (-1)^5 ∏ (1 + z_i) = - ∏ (1 + z_i)\\n\\nSo ∏ (1 + z_i) = - f(-1)\\n\\nThus:\\n\\n∏ (1 - z_i²) = ∏ (1 - z_i) ∏ (1 + z_i) = f(1) * [ - f(-1) ] = - f(1) f(-1)\\n\\nSimilarly, ∏ (1 + z_i²) = ∏ (1 + z_i²)\\n\\nNow, 1 + z_i² is not factoring nicely.\\n\\nBut note that ∏ (1 + z_i²) = ∏ (z_i² - (-1))\\n\\nBut not directly.\\n\\nConsider the polynomial whose roots are z_i². But that’s what P is, but we don’t know P.\\n\\nAnother idea: consider the transformation.\\n\\nWe have:\\n\\nP(1)/P(-1) = - ∏ (1 - z_i²)/(1 + z_i²)\\n\\nNow, (1 - z²)/(1 + z²) = [ (1/z - z) / (1/z + z) ] * (z/z) ? Not helpful.\\n\\nNote that:\\n\\n\\\\frac{1 - z^2}{1 + z^2} = \\\\frac{ -(z^2 - 1) }{ z^2 + 1 }\\n\\nBut still.\\n\\nLet’s compute f(1) and f(-1):\\n\\nf(z) = z^5 + 2004z - 1\\n\\nf(1) = 1 + 2004 - 1 = 2004\\nf(-1) = -1 - 2004 - 1 = -2006\\n\\nNow, earlier:\\n\\n∏ (1 - z_i²) = - f(1) f(-1) = - (2004)(-2006) = 2004 × 2006\\n\\nNow, need ∏ (1 + z_i²)\\n\\nNote that 1 + z_i² = |something|, but complex.\\n\\nConsider that ∏ (z_i² + 1) = ∏ (z_i - i)(z_i + i) = [ ∏ (z_i - i) ] [ ∏ (z_i + i) ] = f(i) f(-i)\\n\\nYes!\\n\\nBecause f(i) = ∏ (i - z_j) = (-1)^5 ∏ (z_j - i) = - ∏ (z_j - i)\\nWait:\\nf(z) = ∏ (z - z_j), so f(i) = ∏ (i - z_j)\\nf(-i) = ∏ (-i - z_j)\\n\\nBut ∏ (z_j - i) = ∏ - (i - z_j) = (-1)^5 ∏ (i - z_j) = - f(i)\\nSimilarly, ∏ (z_j + i) = ∏ (z_j - (-i)) = ?\\nf(-i) = ∏ (-i - z_j) = ∏ - (z_j + i) = (-1)^5 ∏ (z_j + i) = - ∏ (z_j + i)\\nSo ∏ (z_j + i) = - f(-i)\\n\\nBut we want ∏ (1 + z_j²) = ∏ (z_j² + 1) = ∏ (z_j - i)(z_j + i) = [∏ (z_j - i)] [∏ (z_j + i)]\\n\\n= [ - f(i) ] [ - f(-i) ] = f(i) f(-i)\\n\\nYes!\\n\\nSo ∏ (1 + z_i²) = f(i) f(-i)\\n\\nNow compute f(i) and f(-i):\\n\\nf(i) = i^5 + 2004 i - 1 = i^4 * i + 2004 i - 1 = (1)*i + 2004 i - 1 = 2005 i - 1\\n\\nf(-i) = (-i)^5 + 2004 (-i) - 1 = -i^5 - 2004 i - 1 = - (i^5) - 2004 i - 1 = - (i) - 2004 i - 1 = -2005 i - 1\\n\\nSo f(i) f(-i) = (2005 i - 1)(-2005 i - 1) = - (2005 i - 1)(2005 i + 1) = - [ (2005 i)^2 - (1)^2 ] = - [ -2005² - 1 ] = - [ - (2005² + 1) ] = 2005² + 1\\n\\nCompute:\\n(a-b)(a+b) = a² - b², here a=2005i, b=1\\nSo (2005i)^2 - (1)^2 = -2005² - 1\\nThen multiplied by -1: - ( -2005² - 1 ) = 2005² + 1\\nYes.\\n\\nSo ∏ (1 + z_i²) = 2005² + 1\\n\\nEarlier:\\n∏ (1 - z_i²) = 2004 × 2006\\n\\nNow, 2004 × 2006 = (2005 - 1)(2005 + 1) = 2005² - 1\\n\\nSo now:\\n\\n∏ (1 - z_i²)/(1 + z_i²) = (2005² - 1) / (2005² + 1)\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\nP(1)/P(-1) = - ∏ (1 - z_i²)/(1 + z_i²) = - (2005² - 1)/(2005² + 1)\\n\\nBut is this simplified? We can leave it, but perhaps compute numerically, but better exact.\\n\\nBut wait: is this the final answer? It's a number.\\n\\nBut let's confirm:\\n\\nP(1)/P(-1) = - (2005² - 1)/(2005² + 1)\\n\\nBut the problem asks for the quotient, so this should be fine.\\n\\nBut let me double-check signs.\\n\\nWe had:\\nP(1)/P(-1) = ∏ [ (1 - w_i) / (-1 - w_i) ] = ∏ [ (1 - z_i²) / (-1 - z_i²) ]\\n\\nNow, -1 - z_i² = - (1 + z_i²)\\nSo (1 - z_i²) / (-1 - z_i²) = (1 - z_i²) / [ - (1 + z_i²) ] = - (1 - z_i²)/(1 + z_i²)\\n\\nThen product over 5 terms: [ - (1 - z_i²)/(1 + z_i²) ] for each i, so total (-1)^5 ∏ (1 - z_i²)/(1 + z_i²) = - ∏ (1 - z_i²)/(1 + z_i²)\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd ∏ (1 - z_i²) = ∏ (1 - z_i)(1 + z_i) = f(1) * [ - f(-1) ]? Earlier:\\n\\nf(1) = ∏ (1 - z_i)\\nf(-1) = ∏ (-1 - z_i) = ∏ - (1 + z_i) = (-1)^5 ∏ (1 + z_i) = - ∏ (1 + z_i)\\nSo ∏ (1 + z_i) = - f(-1)\\nThus ∏ (1 - z_i²) = f(1) * [ - f(-1) ]? No:\\n∏ (1 - z_i²) = ∏ (1 - z_i) ∏ (1 + z_i) = f(1) * [ - f(-1) ]\\nBut f(-1) = -2006, so -f(-1) = 2006\\nf(1)=2004\\nSo 2004 * 2006, yes.\\nAnd f(1) * [-f(-1)] = 2004 * [- (-2006)] = 2004 * 2006, yes.\\n\\nAnd ∏ (1 + z_i²) = f(i) f(-i) = 2005² + 1\\n\\nSo ratio ∏ (1 - z_i²)/(1 + z_i²) = (2004×2006)/(2005² + 1) = (2005² - 1)/(2005² + 1)\\n\\nThus P(1)/P(-1) = - (2005² - 1)/(2005² + 1)\\n\\nNow, 2005² = (2000+5)^2 = 2000² + 2*2000*5 + 5² = 4,000,000 + 20,000 + 25 = 4,020,025\\nSo numerator: 4,020,025 - 1 = 4,020,024\\nDenominator: 4,020,025 + 1 = 4,020,026\\nBut better to leave as expression.\\n\\nBut the answer is - (2005² - 1)/(2005² + 1)\\n\\nBut is this simplified? Or can it be written as a single fraction.\\n\\nBut the problem likely expects a simplified fraction or integer, but this is already simplified.\\n\\nBut let me check if this is correct.\\n\\nAlternative approach: since P(z²) = 0 whenever z^5 + 2004z = 1, then z² is a root of P.\\n\\nSo the minimal polynomial for z² over the rationals divides P, but since degree 5, and likely irreducible, P is essentially the minimal polynomial of z² for a root z.\\n\\nBut anyway, our calculation seems solid.\\n\\nNote that the actual value is - (2005² - 1)/(2005² + 1) = - (4020025 - 1)/(4020025 + 1) = -4020024/4020026\\n\\nBut we can simplify this fraction.\\n\\nLet d = gcd(4020024, 4020026)\\nNote they are consecutive even numbers? 4020026 - 4020024 = 2, so gcd divides 2.\\nBoth even, so gcd=2.\\nSo -4020024/4020026 = - (4020024÷2) / (4020026÷2) = -2010012 / 2010013\\n\\nBut perhaps better to leave in terms of 2005.\\n\\nBut the expression - (2005² - 1)/(2005² + 1) is acceptable, but perhaps they want a single number.\\n\\nBut in the context, since 2005 comes from 2004+1, and 2004 is given, likely this is fine.\\n\\nBut let me confirm with a smaller case or logic.\\n\\nNotice that in the expression, it's symmetric.\\n\\nAnother way: since the polynomial is odd in some sense, but anyway.\\n\\nI think the answer is - (2005² - 1)/(2005² + 1)\\n\\nBut let me write it as a boxed answer.\\n\\nHowever, in the JSON, we need to put the exact value.\\n\\nBut perhaps simplify:\\nP(1)/P(-1) = - \\\\frac{2005^2 - 1}{2005^2 + 1}\\n\\nBut as a number, but it's a fraction.\\n\\nSince 2005 is given by the constant, but 2005 = 2004 + 1, but not necessary.\\n\\nI think this is the simplest form.\\n\\nBut let me check the calculation once more.\\n\\nf(i) = i^5 + 2004 i - 1 = i^4 * i + 2004 i - 1 = 1*i + 2004i -1 = 2005i -1\\nf(-i) = (-i)^5 + 2004*(-i) -1 = -i^5 -2004i -1 = - (i) -2004i -1 = -2005i -1\\nProduct: (2005i -1)(-2005i -1) = let u=2005i, then (u -1)(-u -1) = -u(u) -u(-1) + (-1)(-u) + (-1)(-1)? Better: (a)(b) with a=2005i-1, b=-2005i-1\\na*b = (2005i)(-2005i) + (2005i)(-1) + (-1)(-2005i) + (-1)(-1) = -2005² i² -2005i + 2005i + 1 = -2005² (-1) + 0 + 1 = 2005² + 1\\nYes.\\nf(1)=1^5 +2004*1 -1=2004\\nf(-1)=(-1)^5 +2004*(-1) -1= -1 -2004 -1= -2006\\nThen ∏(1 - z_i^2) = f(1) * [ - f(-1) ] = 2004 * [ - (-2006) ] = 2004 * 2006\\nYes.\\n2004*2006 = (2005-1)(2005+1)=2005^2 -1\\nSo ratio inside: (2005^2 -1)/(2005^2 +1)\\nThen overall: - times that.\\nSo yes.\\n\\nThus P(1)/P(-1) = - \\\\frac{2005^2 - 1}{2005^2 + 1}\\n\\nNow, for the answer, we can write it as a fraction.\\n\\nBut in the JSON, we need to put the exact value.\\n\\nPerhaps compute the fraction: -4020024 / 4020026 = -2010012 / 2010013\\n\\nBut the latter is simplified, since consecutive integers almost, gcd(2010012,2010013)=1 because consecutive integers are coprime.\\n2010013 - 2010012 =1, so yes, coprime.\\n\\nSo -2010012 / 2010013\\n\\nBut perhaps the problem expects the expression in terms of 2005, but I think the simplified fraction is fine, but actually the unsimplified might be acceptable.\\n\\nLooking back, in such problems, often the answer is left as a fraction.\\n\\nBut to be precise, let's use the expression.\\n\\nNotice that 2005 = 2004 + 1, but 2004 is given, so probably - ( (2004+1)^2 - 1 ) / ( (2004+1)^2 + 1 ) but same.\\n\\nI think - (2005^2 - 1)/(2005^2 + 1) is acceptable, but for the box, perhaps write the numerical fraction.\\n\\nBut in the instruction, it says \"exact value\", so fractional form is fine.\\n\\nSince it's a quotient, and likely simplifies, but it doesn't simplify to integer.\\n\\nAnother thought: is P monic? We have a constant c, but it cancels in the ratio, so fine.\\n\\nSo I think this is correct.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: 337\\nProblem 2: - (2005^2 - 1)/(2005^2 + 1)\\n\\nBut to write in JSON, need to put as string.\\n\\nPerhaps write as fraction.\\n\\nSince 2005^2 = 4020025, so - (4020025 - 1)/(4020025 + 1) = -4020024/4020026\\n\\nThen simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: -2010012/2010013\\n\\nAnd this is reduced.\\n\\nSo answer 2: -2010012/2010013\\n\\nBut let me confirm the arithmetic:\\n2005^2 = 2005 * 2005.\\n2000^2=4,000,000\\n5^2=25\\n2*2000*5=20,000\\nSo 4,000,000 + 20,000 + 25 = 4,020,025 yes.\\nSo 2005^2 -1 = 4,020,024\\n2005^2 +1 = 4,020,026\\nNow gcd(4020024,4020026). As difference is 2, and both even, so gcd=2.\\n4020024 ÷ 2 = 2010012\\n4020026 ÷ 2 = 2010013\\nNow 2010012 and 2010013 are consecutive integers? 2010013 - 2010012 =1, yes, so coprime.\\nSo simplified fraction is -2010012/2010013\\n\\nSo this is the exact value.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"337\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-2010012/2010013\"\n}",
