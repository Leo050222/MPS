Then:\\n\\n$$\\nf(z) = (z^{2/3}) f(z^{1/3}) + f(0)\\n$$\\n\\nNot very helpful unless we assume form.\\n\\nTry to guess possible functions.\\n\\nTry $f(x) = kx$: linear function.\\n\\nLeft-hand side: $f(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = k(x^3 + y^3 + xy)$\\n\\nRight-hand side: $x^2(kx) + y^2(ky) + f(xy) = kx^3 + ky^3 + kxy = k(x^3 + y^3 + xy)$\\n\\nPerfect! So $f(x) = kx$ works for any constant $k$.\\n\\nNow try $f(x) = c$, constant.\\n\\nLHS: $f(...) = c$\\n\\nRHS: $x^2 c + y^2 c + c = c(x^2 + y^2 + 1)$\\n\\nThis equals $c$ only if $c(x^2 + y^2 + 1) = c$ for all $x,y$, which implies $c=0$.\\n\\nSo $f(x) = 0$ is a solution — and it's included in $f(x)=kx$ with $k=0$.\\n\\nAre there other solutions?\\n\\nSuppose $f$ is such a function. Define $g(x) = f(x) - kx$, can we show $g=0$?\\n\\nBut let's try to use the equation more.\\n\\nFrom earlier: $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x) + f(0)$\\n\\nSuppose we define $f(0) = c$.\\n\\nSet $x = y$.\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x^3 + x^3 + x^2) = x^2 f(x) + x^2 f(x) + f(x^2)\\n\\\\Rightarrow f(2x^3 + x^2) = 2x^2 f(x) + f(x^2)\\n$$\\n\\nNot obviously helpful.\\n\\nGo back to original equation.\\n\\nLet’s suppose $f(x) = kx$ is the only solution. We already saw it works.\\n\\nTry to prove it's the only one.\\n\\nAssume $f$ satisfies the equation.\\n\\nFrom Equation (1): $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x) + f(0)$\\n\\nLet’s denote $c = f(0)$.\\n\\nNow go back to original equation:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = x^2 f(x) + y^2 f(y) + f(xy)\\n$$\\n\\nBut from (1), $x^2 f(x) = f(x^3) - c$, similarly $y^2 f(y) = f(y^3) - c$\\n\\nSo RHS becomes:\\n\\n$$\\n(f(x^3) - c) + (f(y^3) - c) + f(xy) = f(x^3) + f(y^3) + f(xy) - 2c\\n$$\\n\\nThus:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = f(x^3) + f(y^3) + f(xy) - 2c\\n$$\\n\\nLet $a = x^3$, $b = y^3$, $t = xy$\\n\\nBut note: $t = xy = (a^{1/3})(b^{1/3}) = (ab)^{1/3}$, so not independent.\\n\\nAlternatively, set $u = x^3$, $v = y^3$, then $x = u^{1/3}$, $y = v^{1/3}$, so $xy = u^{1/3} v^{1/3} = (uv)^{1/3}$\\n\\nThen the equation becomes:\\n\\n$$\\nf(u + v + (uv)^{1/3}) = f(u) + f(v) + f((uv)^{1/3}) - 2c\\n$$\\n\\nMessy.\\n\\nAlternative idea: suppose $c = f(0) = 0$. Then Equation (1): $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x)$\\n\\nAnd the transformed equation:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = f(x^3) + f(y^3) + f(xy)\\n$$\\n\\nSo if $f(0) = 0$, then $f(a + b + t) = f(a) + f(b) + f(t)$ where $a = x^3$, $b = y^3$, $t = xy$, but again constrained.\\n\\nBut notice that if we define $g(x) = f(x)$, and suppose $f(0) = 0$, then:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = f(x^3) + f(y^3) + f(xy)\\n$$\\n\\nThis looks additive on certain combinations.\\n\\nSuppose we suspect $f(x) = kx$ is the only solution. We already know it works.\\n\\nTry to compute $f$ at some points.\\n\\nSet $x = 1$, $y = 0$:\\n\\n$f(1^3 + 0 + 0) = 1^2 f(1) + 0 + f(0) \\\\Rightarrow f(1) = f(1) + f(0) \\\\Rightarrow f(0) = 0$\\n\\nOh! Important!\\n\\nSo from $x=1, y=0$:\\n\\n$f(1) = 1^2 f(1) + 0 + f(0) \\\\Rightarrow f(1) = f(1) + f(0) \\\\Rightarrow f(0) = 0$\\n\\nSo $f(0) = 0$\\n\\nGreat! So now Equation (1): $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x)$\\n\\nAnd the main equation becomes:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = x^2 f(x) + y^2 f(y) + f(xy) = f(x^3) + f(y^3) + f(xy)\\n$$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = f(x^3) + f(y^3) + f(xy) \\\\quad (*))\\n$$\\n\\nNow, this suggests that $f$ is additive over these expressions.\\n\\nNow, can we show $f$ is additive in general? Or linear?\\n\\nTry $y = 1$:\\n\\nThen (*) becomes:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x^3 + 1 + x) = f(x^3) + f(1) + f(x)\\n$$\\n\\nBut $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x)$, so:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x^3 + x + 1) = x^2 f(x) + f(x) + f(1) = f(x)(x^2 + 1) + f(1)\\n$$\\n\\nNot sure.\\n\\nBut suppose we assume $f$ is a polynomial.\\n\\nAssume $f(x) = a_n x^n + \\\\cdots$\\n\\nFrom $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x)$, left side degree $3n$, right side $2 + n$, so $3n = n + 2 \\\\Rightarrow 2n = 2 \\\\Rightarrow n = 1$\\n\\nSo if polynomial, must be linear.\\n\\nAnd since $f(0) = 0$, $f(x) = kx$\\n\\nAnd we already checked it works.\\n\\nBut is it the only solution without assuming polynomial?\\n\\nTry to show $f$ is odd or something.\\n\\nSet $y = -x$:\\n\\nCompute LHS: $x^3 + (-x)^3 + x(-x) = x^3 - x^3 - x^2 = -x^2$\\n\\nRHS: $x^2 f(x) + (-x)^2 f(-x) + f(x \\\\cdot (-x)) = x^2 f(x) + x^2 f(-x) + f(-x^2)$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nf(-x^2) = x^2 [f(x) + f(-x)] + f(-x^2)\\n$$\\n\\nWait:\\n\\nLHS: $f(-x^2)$\\n\\nRHS: $x^2 f(x) + x^2 f(-x) + f(-x^2)$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nf(-x^2) = x^2 (f(x) + f(-x)) + f(-x^2)\\n\\\\Rightarrow 0 = x^2 (f(x) + f(-x))\\n$$\\n\\nFor all $x$, so for $x \\\\ne 0$, $f(x) + f(-x) = 0$, so $f$ is odd.\\n\\nGood, $f(-x) = -f(x)$\\n\\nNow, go back to equation (*):\\n\\n$$\\nf(a + b + t) = f(a) + f(b) + f(t)\\n$$\\nwhen $a = x^3$, $b = y^3$, $t = xy$\\n\\nBut $a + b + t = x^3 + y^3 + xy$\\n\\nNote identity: $x^3 + y^3 = (x+y)(x^2 - xy + y^2)$, not helpful.\\n\\nTry specific values.\\n\\nLet $x = y = 1$:\\n\\nLHS: $f(1 + 1 + 1) = f(3)$\\n\\nRHS: $f(1) + f(1) + f(1) = 3f(1)$\\n\\nSo $f(3) = 3f(1)$\\n\\nSimilarly, $x=2, y=0$: $f(8) = 4 f(2)$, but also $f(8) = f((2)^3) = 4 f(2)$, yes.\\n\\nTry $x=2, y=1$:\\n\\nLHS: $f(8 + 1 + 2) = f(11)$\\n\\nRHS: $f(8) + f(1) + f(2) = 4f(2) + f(1) + f(2) = 5f(2) + f(1)$\\n\\nBut $f(11) = ?$\\n\\nIf $f(x) = kx$, then $f(11) = 11k$, and $5f(2)+f(1)=10k + k = 11k$, good.\\n\\nBut can we get a contradiction otherwise?\\n\\nSuppose we define $k = f(1)$\\n\\nWe have $f(1) = k$\\n\\n$f(0) = 0$\\n\\n$f(x^3) = x^2 f(x)$\\n\\nTry $x=1$: $f(1) = 1 \\\\cdot f(1)$, ok.\\n\\n$x=2$: $f(8) = 4 f(2)$\\n\\nCan we find $f(2)$?\\n\\nSet $x=1, y=1$: already did, $f(3) = 3k$\\n\\nSet $x=1, y=2$:\\n\\nLHS: $f(1 + 8 + 2) = f(11)$\\n\\nRHS: $f(1) + f(8) + f(2) = k + 4f(2) + f(2) = k + 5f(2)$\\n\\nSo $f(11) = k + 5f(2)$\\n\\nSet $x=3, y=0$: $f(27) = 9 f(3) = 9 \\\\cdot 3k = 27k$\\n\\nSet $x=3, y=1$:\\n\\nLHS: $f(27 + 1 + 3) = f(31)$\\n\\nRHS: $f(27) + f(1) + f(3) = 27k + k + 3k = 31k$\\n\\nSo $f(31) = 31k$\\n\\nSimilarly, seems like $f(n) = nk$ for integers?\\n\\nTry to show $f(x) = kx$ for all $x$.\\n\\nNote that for any $x$, $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x)$\\n\\nSuppose we let $u = x^3$, then $f(u) = (u^{2/3}) f(u^{1/3})$\\n\\nBut not helpful.\\n\\nBack to equation (*) with $y = 1$:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x^3 + 1 + x) = f(x^3) + f(1) + f(x) = x^2 f(x) + k + f(x) = f(x)(x^2 + 1) + k\\n$$\\n\\nLet $z = x^3 + x + 1$, then $f(z) = f(x)(x^2 + 1) + k$\\n\\nBut $x$ is related to $z$ by cubic, hard to invert.\\n\\nHowever, as $x$ runs over $\\\\mathbb{R}$, $x^3 + x + 1$ runs over all $\\\\mathbb{R}$ (since continuous, limits $\\\\pm\\\\infty$), so for every real $z$, there is $x$ such that $z = x^3 + x + 1$, and then $f(z) = f(x)(x^2 + 1) + k$\\n\\nBut still depends on $x$.\\n\\nSuppose $f(x) = kx$ for all $x$, then it works.\\n\\nAssume there is another solution.\\n\\nBut from the polynomial assumption, only linear.\\n\\nTry to show $f$ is additive.\\n\\nSuppose we can show $f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b)$ for all $a,b$, then with regularity, $f(x)=kx$.\\n\\nBut we have a weaker additivity.\\n\\nNotice that in equation (*): $f(A + B + C) = f(A) + f(B) + f(C)$ when $A = x^3$, $B = y^3$, $C = xy$\\n\\nBut $A, B, C$ are linked.\\n\\nSet $y = x$:\\n\\nThen $f(x^3 + x^3 + x^2) = f(x^3) + f(x^3) + f(x^2) \\\\Rightarrow f(2x^3 + x^2) = 2f(x^3) + f(x^2)$\\n\\nBut $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x)$, so:\\n\\n$$\\nf(2x^3 + x^2) = 2x^2 f(x) + f(x^2)\\n$$\\n\\nNow, this must hold for all $x$.\\n\\nSuppose $f(x) = kx$, then LHS: $k(2x^3 + x^2)$, RHS: $2x^2 (kx) + k x^2 = 2k x^3 + k x^2$, same.\\n\\nNow, can we use this to find $f(x^2)$?\\n\\nFrom $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x)$, set $x = \\\\sqrt{t}$, then $f(t^{3/2}) = t f(\\\\sqrt{t})$\\n\\nMessy.\\n\\nAnother idea: set $x = y = t^{1/3}$\\n\\nThen $x^3 = t$, $y^3 = t$, $xy = t^{2/3}$\\n\\nLHS: $f(t + t + t^{2/3}) = f(2t + t^{2/3})$\\n\\nRHS: $f(t) + f(t) + f(t^{2/3}) = 2f(t) + f(t^{2/3})$\\n\\nSo $f(2t + t^{2/3}) = 2f(t) + f(t^{2/3})$\\n\\nStill complicated.\\n\\nBut perhaps the only solutions are linear.\\n\\nSince we have $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x)$ and the functional equation resembles linearity, and we have no other obvious solutions, and linear works, likely only solutions are $f(x) = kx$.\\n\\nTo confirm, suppose $f(x) = kx$, then:\\n\\nLHS: $k(x^3 + y^3 + xy)$\\n\\nRHS: $x^2 (kx) + y^2 (ky) + k(xy) = kx^3 + ky^3 + kxy = k(x^3 + y^3 + xy)$\\n\\nEqual.\\n\\nAnd we derived $f(0)=0$, $f$ odd, and for several points it matches linear.\\n\\nMoreover, if we assume continuity or monotonicity, must be linear, but not assumed.\\n\\nHowever, in functional equations over $\\\\mathbb{R}$, sometimes pathological solutions exist, but here the relation $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x)$ might restrict.\\n\\nSuppose $f$ is not linear, but satisfies.\\n\\nBut from $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x)$, iteratively, for $x \\\\ne 0$,\\n\\n$f(x) = \\\\frac{f(x^3)}{x^2}$\\n\\n$f(x^3) = \\\\frac{f(x^9)}{x^6}$, so $f(x) = \\\\frac{f(x^9)}{x^8}$\\n\\nIn general, $f(x) = \\\\frac{f(x^{3^n})}{x^{2(3^n - 1)/ (3-1)}} } wait\\n\\nExponent: each time denominator multiplies by $x^{2 \\\\cdot 3^{k}}$?\\n\\nFrom $f(x) = f(x^3)/x^2$\\n\\n$f(x^3) = f(x^9)/ (x^3)^2 = f(x^9)/x^6$\\n\\nSo $f(x) = [f(x^9)/x^6] / x^2 = f(x^9)/x^8$\\n\\nSimilarly, $f(x) = f(x^{3^n}) / x^{2(1 + 3 + 3^2 + \\\\cdots + 3^{n-1})} = f(x^{3^n}) / x^{2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{3^n - 1}{2}} = f(x^{3^n}) / x^{3^n - 1}$\\n\\nSo $f(x) = \\\\frac{f(x^{3^n})}{x^{3^n - 1}}$\\n\\nAs $n \\\\to \\\\infty$, if $|x| > 1$, $x^{3^n} \\\\to \\\\infty$, if $|x| < 1$, $x^{3^n} \\\\to 0$\\n\\nIf we assume $f$ is bounded near 0 or infinity, then $f(x) = 0$, but not necessarily.\\n\\nBut without additional assumptions, hard to rule out pathological solutions.\\n\\nHowever, in olympiad problems, usually the only solutions are the nice ones.\\n\\nMoreover, the equation is algebraic, so likely only polynomial solutions, which we saw must be linear.\\n\\nThus, the only solutions are $f(x) = kx$ for constant $k$.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 1: all functions of the form $f(x) = kx$ for some constant $k$.\\n\\n---\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nFind a sequence of maximal length consisting of non-zero integers in which the sum of any seven consecutive terms is positive and that of any eleven consecutive terms is negative.\\n\\nLet the sequence be $a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$, each $a_i \\\\ne 0$ integer.\\n\\nConditions:\\n\\n- For all $i$, $a_i + a_{i+1} + \\\\cdots + a_{i+6} > 0$\\n- For all $i$, $a_i + a_{i+1} + \\\\cdots + a_{i+10} < 0$\\n\\nWe want maximal $n$.\\n\\nLet $s_k = a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_k$ be the partial sum.\\n\\nThen sum from $i$ to $j$ is $s_j - s_{i-1}$\\n\\nSum of 7 consecutive: $s_{i+6} - s_{i-1} > 0$ for $i=1$ to $n-6$\\n\\nSum of 11 consecutive: $s_{i+10} - s_{i-1} < 0$ for $i=1$ to $n-10$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$s_{i+6} > s_{i-1}$ for $i=1,2,\\\\ldots,n-6$\\n\\n$s_{i+10} < s_{i-1}$ for $i=1,2,\\\\ldots,n-10$\\n\\nSet $j = i-1$, then:\\n\\nFor $j=0$ to $n-7$: $s_{j+7} > s_j$\\n\\nFor $j=0$ to $n-11$: $s_{j+11} < s_j$\\n\\nSo the sequence $s_j$ satisfies:\\n\\n- $s_{j+7} > s_j$ for $j=0,1,\\\\ldots,n-7$\\n- $s_{j+11} < s_j$ for $j=0,1,\\\\ldots,n-11$\\n\\nAnd $s_0 = 0$\\n\\nWe want to maximize $n$ such that such a sequence of integers $a_i \\\\ne 0$ exists, so $s_j$ are integers, $s_j \\\\ne s_{j-1}$ for $j=1,\\\\ldots,n$\\n\\nThe inequalities are strict.\\n\\nNow, consider the values $s_0, s_7, s_{14}, \\\\ldots$\\n\\nFrom $s_{j+7} > s_j$, so $s_7 > s_0 = 0$\\n\\n$s_{14} > s_7 > 0$\\n\\n$s_{21} > s_{14} > 0$, etc.\\n\\nSimilarly, $s_{11} < s_0 = 0$\\n\\n$s_{22} < s_{11} < 0$\\n\\n$s_{33} < s_{22} < 0$, etc.\\n\\nNow, suppose the sequence has length $n$.\\n\\nConsider how many times we can apply the inequalities.\\n\\nSuppose $n \\\\geq 17$\\n\\nThen we can look at $s_0, s_7, s_{14}, s_{21}$ but $s_{21}$ requires $j=14 \\\\leq n-7$, so $n \\\\geq 21$\\n\\nSimilarly, $s_{11}, s_{22}$ require $n \\\\geq 22$\\n\\nBut let's find a contradiction for large $n$.\\n\\nNote that 7 and 11 are coprime, so their linear combinations cover integers.\\n\\nSpecifically, the differences generate multiples of gcd(7,11)=1.\\n\\nBut we have inequalities.\\n\\nSuppose we go forward 7 steps: value increases\\n\\nForward 11 steps: value decreases\\n\\nBut we can combine.\\n\\nFor example, $s_{j+7} > s_j$\\n\\n$s_{j+11} < s_j$\\n\\nNow, $s_{j+14} = s_{(j+7)+7} > s_{j+7} > s_j$\\n\\nSimilarly, $s_{j+21} > s_{j+14} > s_j$, etc.\\n\\nSimilarly, $s_{j+22} < s_{j+11} < s_j$\\n\\nNow, consider $s_{77}$: since 77 = 7*11 = 11*7\\n\\nOn one hand, $s_{77} > s_{70} > s_{63} > \\\\cdots > s_0 = 0$, because we can go up by 7 repeatedly: $s_{7k} > s_{7(k-1)} > \\\\cdots > s_0$\\n\\nNumber of steps: from 0 to 77 in steps of 7: 11 steps, so $s_{77} > s_{70} > \\\\cdots > s_0 = 0$, so $s_{77} \\\\geq 11$ since integers and strict increase? Not necessarily, because the increases are not by at least 1 each, but since $s_{j+7} > s_j$ and both integers, $s_{j+7} \\\\geq s_j + 1$\\n\\nYes! Because $s_k$ are integers, $s_{j+7} > s_j$ implies $s_{j+7} \\\\geq s_j + 1$\\n\\nSimilarly, $s_{j+11} < s_j$ implies $s_{j+11} \\\\leq s_j - 1$\\n\\nSo we have:\\n\\n$s_{j+7} \\\\geq s_j + 1$\\n\\n$s_{j+11} \\\\leq s_j - 1$\\n\\nNow, consider $s_{77}$:\\n\\nPath 1: via 7-steps: $s_0, s_7, s_{14}, \\\\ldots, s_{77}$\\n\\nThere are 11 steps (0 to 7, 7 to 14, ..., 70 to 77), each time $\\\\geq +1$, so $s_{77} \\\\geq s_0 + 11 = 11$\\n\\nPath 2: via 11-steps: $s_0, s_{11}, s_{22}, \\\\ldots, s_{77}$\\n\\n11-steps: 0 to 11, 11 to 22, ..., 66 to 77: 7 steps.\\n\\nEach step $s_{j+11} \\\\leq s_j - 1$, so $s_{77} \\\\leq s_0 - 7 = -7$\\n\\nContradiction: $s_{77} \\\\geq 11$ and $s_{77} \\\\leq -7$\\n\\nSo impossible.\\n\\nTherefore, for the sequence to exist, we must not have both $s_{77}$ defined and the inequalities applicable.\\n\\n$s_{77}$ is defined only if $n \\\\geq 77$\\n\\nBut the inequalities for $s_{j+7} \\\\geq s_j + 1$ require $j \\\\leq n-7$, so for $j=70$, need $n-7 \\\\geq 70$, i.e., $n \\\\geq 77$\\n\\nSimilarly for $s_{j+11} \\\\leq s_j - 1$, for $j=66$, need $n-11 \\\\geq 66$, i.e., $n \\\\geq 77$\\n\\nSo for $n \\\\geq 77$, we get contradiction.\\n\\nThus, $n \\\\leq 76$\\n\\nBut is $n=76$ possible?\\n\\nWe need to check if $n=76$ is possible.\\n\\nAt $n=76$, can we avoid the contradiction?\\n\\nFor the 7-step chain: $s_0, s_7, \\\\ldots, s_{70}$ — $s_{70}$ is defined since $70 \\\\leq 76$\\n\\nBut $s_{77}$ is not defined, since $77 > 76$\\n\\nSimilarly, for 11-step: $s_0, s_{11}, \\\\ldots, s_{66}$ — $s_{66}$ defined, $s_{77}$ not.\\n\\nThe last $s_{j+7} > s_j$ is for $j \\\\leq 76-7=69$, so $s_{76} > s_{69}$? $j=69$, $s_{76} > s_{69}$\\n\\nBut we don't have $s_{77}$, so no direct comparison between the chains.\\n\\nSimilarly, $s_{j+11} < s_j$ for $j \\\\leq 76-11=65$, so $s_{76}$ not involved in decrease.\\n\\nSo the chains stop before 77.\\n\\nNow, what is the maximal $n$ such that we can have the inequalities without forcing a contradiction.\\n\\nWe need that the set of indices where we can apply the recurrence doesn't force $s_k$ to be both large and small.\\n\\nNote that the contradiction arose at index 77, which is lcm(7,11)=77 since coprime.\\n\\nIn general, for such problems, the maximal length is $7 + 11 - 1 = 17$, but here we got 76, which is larger.\\n\\n17 is too small.\\n\\nPerhaps 76 is possible?\\n\\nBut let's see smaller contradictions.\\n\\nFor example, can we have $s_{14}$ and $s_{11}$?\\n\\n$s_{14} \\\\geq s_7 + 1 \\\\geq (s_0 + 1) + 1 = 2$\\n\\n$s_{11} \\\\leq s_0 - 1 = -1$\\n\\nNo direct comparison.\\n\\nBut $s_{14}$ and $s_{11}$ are different.\\n\\nNow, $s_{21} \\\\geq s_{14} + 1 \\\\geq 3$\\n\\n$s_{22} \\\\leq s_{11} - 1 \\\\leq -2$\\n\\nStill no conflict.\\n\\nContinue: $s_{28} \\\\geq 4$, $s_{33} \\\\leq -3$, etc.\\n\\nNow, when do they meet?

Not necessarily.\\n\\nSet $s=a+b>0$, $t=b+c>0$, $u=a+b+c<0$\\n\\nThen $u = s + c <0$, but $s>0$, so $c < -s <0$\\n\\nSimilarly, $u = t + a <0$, so $a < -t <0$\\n\\nAlso $s = a+b >0$, $a<0$, so $b > -a >0$\\n\\nSimilarly, $t = b+c >0$, $c<0$, so $b > -c >0$\\n\\nNow $b+c+d<0$, and $c+d>0$, so $d > -c >0$, but $b+c+d<0$, so $d < -b -c <0$ since $b>0,c<0$, $-b-c$ could be negative.\\n\\nSuppose $a=-2$, $b=3$, then $a+b=1>0$\\n\\n$c$ such that $b+c=3+c>0$, so $c>-3$\\n\\n$a+b+c=-2+3+c=1+c<0$, so $c<-1$\\n\\nSo $-3<c<-1$, say $c=-2$\\n\\nThen $b+c=3-2=1>0$\\n\\nNow $c+d=-2+d>0$, so $d>2$\\n\\n$b+c+d=3-2+d=1+d<0$, so $d<-1$\\n\\nBut $d>2$ and $d<-1$ contradiction.\\n\\nSo cannot have 4 terms?

not all a equal.\\n\\nPerhaps use the values from the small case.\\n\\nFor p=7,q=11, a common construction is to set the sequence as follows: let the sequence be periodic or use a sawtooth, but for maximal length, it is known to be p+q-2.\\n\\nAnd in fact, it can be achieved by setting ai = 11 for i=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, and ai = -7 for i=11,12,13,14,15,16, but then sum of 7 consecutive ending at 16 may be negative, and sum of 11 starting at 6 may be positive.\\n\\nPerhaps set ai = k for i=1 to q-1=10, ai = -m for i=11 to 16, but 6 terms.\\n\\nThen sum of 7 consecutive: if it includes only first 10, sum could be positive if k large, but if it includes the -m, may be negative.\\n\\nFor example, sum from i=10 to 16: a10=k, a11 to a16= -m each, so k +6(-m) = k -6m, need >0\\n\\nSum from i=11 to 17 not defined.\\n\\nSum of 11 consecutive: from i=1 to 11: a1 to a10=k, a11= -m, sum=10k -m <0\\n\\nFrom i=2 to 12: 9k -2m <0\\n\\n...\nFrom i=6 to 16: 5k -6m <0\\n\\nAlso sum of 7: from i=1 to 7: 7k >0 good if k>0\\n\\ni=2 to 8: 7k>0\\n\\n...\ni=4 to 10: 7k>0\\n\\ni=5 to 11: 6k -m >0\\n\\ni=6 to 12: 5k -2m >0\\n\\ni=7 to 13: 4k -3m >0\\n\\ni=8 to 14: 3k -4m >0\\n\\ni=9 to 15: 2k -5m >0\\n\\ni=10 to 16: k -6m >0\\n\\nNow sum of 11: from i=1 to 11: 10k -m <0\\n\\ni=2 to 12: 9k -2m <0\\n\\ni=3 to 13: 8k -3m <0\\n\\ni=4 to 14: 7k -4m <0\\n\\ni=5 to 15: 6k -5m <0\\n\\ni=6 to 16: 5k -6m <0\\n\\nWe need k>0, m>0 integers, since -m<0.\\n\\nFrom sum of 7: k -6m >0, so k >6m\\n\\nFrom sum of 11: 5k -6m <0, so 5k <6m\\n\\nBut k >6m and 5k <6m implies 5(6m) <5k <6m, so 30m <6m, 24m<0, impossible since m>0.\\n\\nContradiction.\\n\\nSo this block won't work.\\n\\nPerhaps have positive and negative interspersed.\\n\\nAfter research, I recall that for such problems, the maximal length is indeed p+q-2, and a construction is to set ai = q for i=1,2,...,p-1, ai = -p for i=p,p+1,...,p+q-2, but with the understanding that it may not work for all, but in this case perhaps scale.\\n\\nAnother construction: set the sequence as the second difference or something.\\n\\nPerhaps use ai = 1 for i=1 to 16, but then sum of 11 is positive, not negative.\\n\\nPerhaps most terms -1, but some large positive.\\n\\nSuppose we set a8 and a9 large positive, others negative.\\n\\nFor example, set a8=a9=10, and other ai= -1 for i=1 to 7,10 to 16.\\n\\nThen sum of 7 consecutive: if it includes a8 and a9, may be positive, else may be negative.\\n\\nFor example, sum 1 to 7: -7<0 not >0.\\n\\nFail.\\n\\nSet the first few and last few positive, middle negative, but then sum of 11 may be negative, sum of 7 may be positive if not in middle.\\n\\nFor example, set a1 to a6=2, a7 to a10= -3, a11 to a16=2.\\n\\nThen sum 1 to 7: 2*6 + (-3) = 12-3=9>0 good\\n\\nSum 2 to 8: 2*5 + (-3)*2 = 10-6=4>0\\n\\nSum 3 to 9: 2*4 + (-3)*3 = 8-9= -1<0 not >0\\n\\nFail.\\n\\nPerhaps make the positive values larger.\\n\\nBut it's messy.\\n\\nGiven that in the small cases it works with p+q-2, and the theoretical upper bound from the lcm argument is higher, but the tight bound is p+q-2, and for this problem, likely 16 is the answer.\\n\\nMoreover, in the initial lcm argument, for n=16<77, no contradiction, and 16 is achievable.\\n\\nUpon searching memory, a standard construction is to set ai = q for i = 1,2,…,p-1, ai = -p for i = p,p+1,…,p+q-2, but as we saw, it may not work, but if we set the values properly.\\n\\nFor p=7,q=11, set ai = 11 for i=1 to 6, ai = -7 for i=7 to 16.\\n\\nThen sum of 7 consecutive:\n- i=1: a1 to a7: 11*6 + (-7) = 66-7=59>0\n- i=2: 11*5 + (-7)*2 = 55-14=41>0\n- i=3: 11*4 + (-7)*3 = 44-21=23>0\n- i=4: 11*3 + (-7)*4 = 33-28=5>0\n- i=5: 11*2 + (-7)*5 = 22-35= -13<0 not >0\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut if we set ai = c for i=1 to 6, ai = d for i=7 to 16, with c>0, d<0.\nThen sum i=5 to 11: a5,a6,a7,a8,a9,a10,a11 = c,c,d,d,d,d,d = 2c+5d >0\nSum i=6 to 12: c,d,d,d,d,d,d = c+6d >0\nSum i=7 to 13: 7d >0, but d<0, impossible.\n\nSo indeed, cannot have 7 consecutive d's.\n\nTo avoid that, perhaps make the sequence not constant in blocks.\n\nPerhaps use a sequence like: repeat (1,1,1,1,1,1,-6) but adjusted.\n\nAfter some thought, I recall that the maximal length is 16, and a construction exists.\n\nFor example, set the sequence as follows: let ai = 11 for i=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, but then sum of 11 is positive.\n\nPerhaps ai = -1 for most, but ai = k for i=8,9.\n\nLet's calculate the required.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 16, and for the purpose, we can box it.\n\nSo for Problem 2, the maximal length is 16.\n\nSo answers:\nProblem 1: f(x) =
