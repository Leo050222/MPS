So (2, 5, 3) works.\\n\\nNow check permutations or other possibilities.\\n\\nIs (3, 2, 5) a solution?\\n- 3 | 2^5 + 1 = 33 → 33 mod 3 = 0 → yes.\\n- 2 | 5^3 + 1 = 126 → even → yes.\\n- 5 | 3^2 + 1 = 10 → yes.\\nSo (3, 2, 5) also works.\\n\\nWait: Let's reindex properly. The triple is (p, q, r), so:\\np=3, q=2, r=5\\nCheck:\\n- p|q^r+1 → 3 | 2^5 + 1 = 33 → yes\\n- q|r^p+1 → 2 | 5^3 + 1 = 126 → yes\\n- r|p^q+1 → 5 | 3^2 + 1 = 10 → yes\\nYes! So (3,2,5) works.\\n\\nTry (5,3,2):\\n- 5 | 3^2 + 1 = 10 → yes\\n- 3 | 2^5 + 1 = 33 → yes\\n- 2 | 5^3 + 1 = 126 → even → yes\\nSo (5,3,2) works.\\n\\nSo we have a cycle: (2,5,3), (5,3,2), (3,2,5)\\n\\nAre there more?\\n\\nTry (2,3,7):\\n- 2 | 3^7 +1 = 2187+1=2188 → even → yes\\n- 3 | 7^2 +1 = 49+1=50 → 50 mod 3 = 2 → no\\nNo.\\n\\nTry (2,3,3): but r must be prime, 3 is ok, but q=r=3.\\n- 2 | 3^3 +1 = 28 → yes\\n- 3 | 3^2 +1 = 10 → 10 mod 3 = 1 → no\\nNo.\\n\\nTry (2,2,r): but q=2, then q^r+1 = 2^r +1, p=2 divides it? 2^r +1 is odd → not divisible by 2 → unless r=0, impossible. So p cannot be 2 if q^r +1 is odd. But q≥2, r≥2 → q^r even only if q even. So if q is odd, q^r odd → q^r+1 even → divisible by 2. So p=2 is possible only if q is odd.\\n\\nBut in our earlier solutions, when p=2, q=5 (odd), so 5^3+1=126 even → divisible by 2.\\n\\nNow suppose p=q=r. Let p=q=r be an odd prime.\\nThen p | p^p +1 → p | p^p +1 → but p^p ≡ 0 mod p, so p^p +1 ≡ 1 mod p → not divisible. So no solution with p=q=r.\\n\\nSuppose two are equal.\\nTry p=2, q=3, r=?\\nNeed:\\n- 2 | 3^r +1 → 3^r ≡ -1 mod 2 → always true since 3^r odd, +1 even.\\n- 3 | r^2 +1 → r^2 ≡ -1 mod 3 → -1 mod 3 = 2. Squares mod 3: 0,1 → no square ≡2 mod 3 → impossible.\\nSo no solution with p=2, q=3.\\n\\nTry p=3, q=3, r=?\\n- 3 | 3^r +1 → 3^r ≡ -1 mod 3 → 0 ≡ -1 mod 3 → no.\\nSo if p divides q^r +1 and q=p, then p | p^r +1 → p | 1 → no.\\nSo q ≠ p in general? Not necessarily, but p cannot divide p^r +1 because p^r ≡0, so +1 ≡1 mod p.\\nThus p ∤ p^r +1. So if q=p, then p | q^r +1 = p^r +1 → contradiction.\\nTherefore q ≠ p.\\nSimilarly, from q | r^p +1, if r=q, then q | q^p +1 → q | 1 → no. So r ≠ q.\\nFrom r | p^q +1, if p=r, then r | r^q +1 → r | 1 → no. So p ≠ r.\\nThus p, q, r are distinct.\\n\\nSo all three primes must be distinct.\\n\\nWe already found (2,5,3), (3,2,5), (5,3,2)\\nLet’s test (2,5,3):\\np=2, q=5, r=3\\n- 2 | 5^3 +1 = 125+1=126 → yes\\n- 5 | 3^2 +1 = 9+1=10 → yes\\n- 3 | 2^5 +1 = 32+1=33 → 33/3=11 → yes\\nGood.\\n(3,2,5): p=3,q=2,r=5\\n- 3 | 2^5+1=33 → yes\\n- 2 | 5^3+1=126 → yes\\n- 5 | 3^2+1=10 → yes\\n(5,3,2): p=5,q=3,r=2\\n- 5 | 3^2+1=10 → yes\\n- 3 | 2^5+1=33 → yes\\n- 2 | 5^3+1=126 → yes\\n\\nNow try (2,7,3):\\n- 2 | 7^3+1=343+1=344 → yes\\n- 7 | 3^2+1=10 → 10 mod 7=3 → no\\nNo.\\n(2,3,7): already tried, fails second condition.\\n(2,7,5):\\n- 2 | 7^5+1 → 7^5 odd → +1 even → yes\\n- 7 | 5^2+1=26 → 26 mod 7=5 → no\\nNo.\\n(2,5,7):\\n- 2 | 5^7+1 → 5^7 odd → +1 even → yes\\n- 5 | 7^2+1=50 → 50/5=10 → yes\\n- 7 | 2^5+1=33 → 33 mod 7=5 → no\\nClose, but no.\\n(2,5, something else)?\\nWe had r=3. Try r=7:\\nAlready did, fails last.\\nr=11:\\n- r=11 | p^q +1 = 2^5 +1=33 → 33 mod 11=0 → yes!\\nWait: p=2, q=5, r=11\\nCheck all:\\n- p|q^r+1 → 2 | 5^{11} +1 → 5^{11} odd → +1 even → yes\\n- q|r^p+1 → 5 | 11^2 +1 = 121+1=122 → 122 mod 5 = 2 → no\\nNo.\\n\\nTry (2,7,3): already failed.\\n\\nWhat about including 2 in different positions.\\nWe have three solutions involving (2,3,5) in cyclic order.\\nAre there any others?\\n\\nSuppose p=2.\\nThen p | q^r +1 → 2 | q^r +1 → q^r must be odd → q odd (so q≠2) → q odd prime, r any prime → q^r odd → +1 even → always true.\\nSo for p=2 and q odd, first condition always holds.\\nNow second: q | r^2 +1 (since p=2)\\nThird: r | 2^q +1\\n\\nSo need:\\n- q | r^2 +1\\n- r | 2^q +1\\nwith q, r odd primes, q≠r, and q≠2, r≠2 (but r could be 2? Wait r is prime, could be 2).\\nBut earlier we assumed all distinct and none equal, but let's allow.\\nBut if r=2, then third condition: r | 2^q +1 → 2 | 2^q +1 → 2^q even → +1 odd → not divisible by 2 → no.\\nSo r cannot be 2. Similarly, if q=2, but we are in case p=2, and q≠p, so q≠2 anyway.\\nSo q and r odd primes.\\n\\nSo for p=2, we need:\\n- q | r^2 +1\\n- r | 2^q +1\\n\\nTry small q.\\nq=3: then need r | 2^3 +1 = 9 → r divides 9 → r=3 (but q=r=3, not allowed as before? But earlier logic: q≠r? From q | r^p +1, if r=q, then q | q^2 +1 → q|1 → no. So r≠q.\\nSo r|9 → r=3 only prime, but r≠q=3 → no.\\nSo no solution for q=3, p=2.\\n\\nq=5: need r | 2^5 +1 = 33 → r divides 33 → r=3 or 11 (primes)\\nAlso need q=5 | r^2 +1 → r^2 ≡ -1 mod 5 → -1 mod 5 = 4 → r^2 ≡4 mod 5 → r≡2 or 3 mod 5\\nr=3: 3 mod 5=3 → 3^2=9≡4 → yes\\nr=11: 11 mod 5=1 → 1^2=1 ≢4 → no\\nSo only r=3\\nThus (p,q,r)=(2,5,3) — which we already have.\\n\\nq=7: need r | 2^7 +1 = 128+1=129 → 129=3×43 → r=3 or 43\\nAlso need 7 | r^2 +1 → r^2 ≡ -1 mod 7 → -1 mod 7=6\\nSquares mod 7: 0,1,4,2 (since 1^2=1,2^2=4,3^2=2,4^2=2,5^2=4,6^2=1) → squares: 0,1,2,4 → 6 not among them → no solution to r^2 ≡ -1 mod 7\\nThus no r satisfies 7 | r^2 +1\\nSo no solution for q=7\\n\\nq=11: r | 2^{11}+1=2048+1=2049\\n2049 ÷ 3 = 683 → 3×683. Is 683 prime? Check: sqrt~26, check divs: not by 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23 → yes, 683 prime. So r=3 or 683\\nNow need 11 | r^2 +1 → r^2 ≡ -1 mod 11 → -1 mod 11=10\\nSquares mod 11: 1,4,9,5,3,3,5,9,4,1 → 0,1,3,4,5,9 → 10 not among → no solution\\nSo no\\n\\nq=13: r | 2^{13}+1=8192+1=8193\\nDivide by 3: 8+1+9+3=21÷3 → 8193÷3=2731 → 3×2731\\n2731: check if prime? Maybe, but also need 13 | r^2 +1 → r^2 ≡ -1 mod 13 → -1 mod 13=12\\nSquares mod 13: 1,4,9,3,12,10 → 1^2=1,2^2=4,3^2=9,4^2=16≡3,5^2=25≡12,6^2=36≡10,7^2=49≡10,8^2=64≡12,9^2=81≡3,10^2=100≡9,11^2=121≡4,12^2=144≡1 → squares: 0,1,3,4,9,10,12 → 12 is present → yes, solvable.\\nr^2 ≡ -1 mod 13 has solutions (r≡5,8 mod 13)\\nNow r divides 8193=3×2731\\nSo r=3 or 2731\\nr=3: 3 mod 13=3 → 3^2=9 ≢12 → no\\nr=2731: compute 2731 mod 13\\n13×210=2730 → 2731≡1 mod 13 → 1^2=1 ≢12 → no\\nSo no\\n\\nq=17: r | 2^{17}+1=131072+1=131073\\nCheck divisibility: sum digits: 1+3+1+0+7+3=15 → div by 3: 131073÷3=43691\\n43691: check if prime? Not necessary, but need 17 | r^2 +1 → r^2 ≡ -1 mod 17 → -1 mod 17=16\\nSquares mod 17: 1,4,9,16,8,2,15,13,... 4^2=16 → yes, so solvable.\\nr must divide 131073=3×43691\\nAssume r=3 or 43691\\nr=3: r^2+1=10 → 10 mod 17=10≠0 → 17∤10 → no\\nr=43691: compute r^2 +1 mod 17\\nFirst, 43691 mod 17\\n17×2570=43690 → 43691≡1 → r≡1 → r^2+1≡1+1=2 ≢0 mod 17 → no\\nSo no\\n\\nAs q increases, 2^q +1 grows fast, and the condition q | r^2 +1 becomes harder. Likely no more solutions.\\n\\nNow suppose p=3.\\nThen 3 | q^r +1 → q^r ≡ -1 mod 3\\nq mod 3: if q≡1 → q^r≡1 → not -1\\nq≡2 → q^r ≡ (-1)^r mod 3 → if r odd → -1 → good; if r even → 1 → bad\\nSo if q≡2 mod 3, and r odd, then ok.\\nq=2: 2≡2 mod 3, r any odd prime → 2^r ≡ (-1)^r ≡ -1 mod 3 since r odd → 2^r +1 ≡0 mod 3 → yes\\nq=5≡2 mod 3, same\\nq=3: q≡0 → q^r≡0 → +1≡1 ≢0 → no\\nq≡1 mod 3: e.g. q=7,13, etc → q^r≡1 → +1≡2 ≢0 → no\\nSo q≡2 mod 3 and r odd (which it is, since prime >2 or r=2)\\nBut r=2: then q^r = q^2 ≡ ? mod 3\\nIf q≡2, q^2≡1 → +1≡2 ≢0 mod 3 → not divisible\\nSo r must be odd prime → so r≥3\\nThus for p=3, we need q≡2 mod 3, r odd prime ≥3\\nNow second condition: q | r^3 +1 = (r+1)(r^2 -r +1)\\nThird: r | 3^q +1\\n\\nTry q=2: q=2≡2 mod 3, ok\\nThen need:\\n- q=2 | r^3 +1 → r^3 +1 even → r odd → r^3 odd → +1 even → always true for odd r\\n- r | 3^2 +1 = 10 → r divides 10 → r=5 (since r odd prime, r≠2, and r≠q=2, r≠p=3? Not necessarily unequal yet, but earlier we know all distinct, so r≠3, r≠2 → r=5)\\nSo r=5\\nNow check first condition: p=3 | q^r +1 = 2^5 +1=33 → 33/3=11 → yes\\nSo (p,q,r)=(3,2,5) — already have\\n\\nNext q≡2 mod 3: q=5\\nThen need:\\n- q=5 | r^3 +1\\n- r | 3^5 +1 = 243+1=244 → 244=2^2×61 → r=61 (since r odd prime, r≠p=3, r≠q=5)\\nSo r=61\\nNow check 5 | r^3 +1 = 61^3 +1\\n61 mod 5=1 → 61^3 ≡1 → +1=2 → 2 mod 5=2 ≠0 → not divisible\\nNo\\n\\nq=11≡2 mod 3\\nThen r | 3^{11} +1 = 177147 +1 = 177148\\nFactor: even? 177148 ÷2=88574, again ÷2=44287\\nSo 4×44287\\nCheck if 44287 prime? Or factors. But r must be odd prime divisor.\\nNow also 11 | r^3 +1\\nTry small r dividing 177148, but large.\\nNote r | 3^{11}+1, and 11 | r^3 +1\\nBut 3^{11}+1 is fixed, its prime factors are limited.\\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, +1=177148\\nDivide by 2: 88574\\nAgain: 44287\\nNow 44287 ÷ 19? 19×2330=44270, 44287-44270=17 → no\\n23? 23×1925=44275, 44287-44275=12 → no\\n29? 29×1527=44283, 44287-44283=4 → no\\n31? 31×1428=44268, 44287-44268=19 → no\\n37? 37×1197=44289>44287 → no\\n41? 41×1080=44280, 44287-44280=7 → no\\n43? 43×1030=44290> → no\\nSo maybe 44287 is prime? Assume so, then r=44287 or 2, but r odd, so r=44287\\nNow check 11 | r^3 +1 → r^3 ≡ -1 mod 11\\nr=44287 mod 11\\n11×4026=44286 → r≡1 mod 11 → r^3≡1 → +1=2 ≢0 mod 11 → no\\nOther factors? 177148=4×44287, and 44287 seems prime, so only odd prime factor is 44287 → no\\n\\nLarger q will give larger numbers, unlikely.\\n\\nNow p=5\\nThen 5 | q^r +1 → q^r ≡ -1 mod 5\\nq mod 5: possible residues.\\nOrder divides 4.\\nNeed q^r ≡4 mod 5\\nPossible if q≡2,3,4 mod 5\\nq≡4: then q^r ≡ (-1)^r → if r odd → -1≡4 → good\\nq≡2: 2^r mod 5: cycle 2,4,3,1 → want ≡4 → when r≡2 mod 4\\nq≡3: 3^r: 3,4,2,1 → want ≡4 → r≡2 mod 4\\nBut r is prime, so r=2 or odd\\nIf r=2, then for q≡2 or 3, r=2≡2 mod 4 → yes\\nFor q≡4, r=2 even → (-1)^2=1 ≢4 → no\\nSo cases:\\n- q≡4 mod 5, r odd\\n- q≡2 or 3 mod 5, r=2 or r≡2 mod 4 but r prime, so r=2 (since if r>2, r odd, r≡1 or 3 mod 4, not 2)\\nSo only r=2 for q≡2,3 mod 5\\nBut r=2: then third condition: r | p^q +1 → 2 | 5^q +1 → 5^q odd → +1 even → yes, always\\nNow second condition: q | r^p +1 = 2^5 +1=33 → q divides 33 → q=3,11 (primes)\\nNow q=3: ≡3 mod 5 → so need r=2 (which we have)\\nNow check first condition: p=5 | q^r +1 = 3^2 +1=10 → yes\\nSo (5,3,2) — already have\\nq=11: ≡1 mod 5? 11÷5=2*5=10, rem 1 → ≡1 → but we need q≡2,3,4 for possibility, but ≡1 → q^r ≡1^r=1 ≢4 mod 5 → so 5 ∤ 11^2 +1=122 → 122/5=24.4 → no\\nSo only q=3\\nThus only known solution\\n\\nOther cases seem not to yield new solutions.\\n\\nMoreover, the three solutions we have are cyclic permutations of (2,3,5) in the order (p,q,r) = (2,5,3), (3,2,5), (5,3,2)\\nNote: (2,3,5) itself: p=2,q=3,r=5\\n- 2 | 3^5 +1=244 → yes\\n- 3 | 5^2 +1=26 → 26 mod 3=2 → no\\nNot a solution\\nOnly the specific cyclic shifts where each divides the next in the chain.\\n\\nWe conjecture these are the only ones.\\n\\nLiterature or known problem: This is a classic problem, and the only solutions are the three cyclic permutations of (2,3,5) in the specified order.\\n\\nThus the ordered triples are (2,5,3), (3,2,5), (5,3,2)\\n\\nProblem 2: We have n ≥ 3, start with n ones on the board. Two buckets, initially empty.\\nA move: erase two numbers a,b, replace with 1 and a+b, add one stone to first bucket, gcd(a,b) stones to second bucket.\\nAfter finite moves, s = number of moves (since one stone per move to first bucket), t = sum of gcd(a,b) over all moves.\\nFind all possible values of t/s.\\n\\nNote: Each move reduces the count of numbers on the board by 1: remove 2, add 2 → net 0? Wait: erase two, replace with two: 1 and a+b → so still two added, so total numbers unchanged?\\nStart with n numbers.\\nErase two → now n-2\\nAdd two → n-2+2 = n\\nSo number of numbers remains constant? But then we can keep moving forever?\\nBut the problem says \\\"after some finite number of moves\\\", implying it stops? But no stopping condition mentioned.\\nRe-read: \\\"After some finite number of moves, there are s stones...\\\" — it doesn't say the process stops; it just performs a finite number of moves and stops at that point.\\nSo we can perform k moves for any k, but probably we need to see what ratios are achievable.\\nBut s is the number of moves, t is the sum of gcds over those moves.\\nAnd we need t/s.\\nBut s can vary, so ratio might depend on how many moves.\\nBut the question asks for all possible values of t/s, so over all possible sequences and lengths.\\n\\nBut perhaps the final state or invariant restricts.\\nNote: each move: we replace a,b with 1 and a+b.\\nThe key is that we always introduce a 1, and combine a and b into a+b.\\nAlso, the sum of numbers on the board: initially sum = n * 1 = n\\nEach move: remove a,b, add 1 and a+b → change in sum: -a -b +1 + (a+b) = 1\\nSo sum increases by 1 per move.\\nAfter s moves, sum = n + s\\n\\nAlso, the multiset evolves.\\nNotice that we always add a 1, so there is always at least one 1 on the board after the first move, but initially there are n ones, so plenty.\\nBut when we pick two numbers, they could both be greater than 1.\\n\\nThe gcd(a,b) depends on a and b.\\nWe need to find possible t/s.\\n\\nPerhaps consider invariants or potential functions.\\nAnother idea: think of the numbers as representing sizes of sets or something, but maybe not.\\nNote that the operation resembles the Euclidean algorithm, but with a twist.\\n\\nObserve: every time we do a move, we are effectively combining two numbers into their sum, but also adding a 1 back.\\nThe 1 might be used later.\\n\\nConsider the sum of the numbers: as above, after s moves, sum = n + s\\n\\nAlso, consider the sum of gcds: t = sum of gcd(a_i,b_i) over moves.\\n\\nBut hard to track.\\n\\nAnother idea: consider the entire process as building a binary tree or expression.\\nEach number on the board can be thought of as being composed of initial 1s.\\nSince we start with n ones, and operations involve summing, each number present is a sum of some subset of the original 1s, i.e., an integer, and specifically, the value is the size of the group.\\nBut when we combine a and b, we form a+b, which represents the union of the groups.\\nHowever, we also add a 1, which is a new singleton.\\nBut the 1 we add is not from the original; it's a new entity.\\nThis complicates things.\\n\\nActually, the added 1 is not linked to the originals; it's just a number 1 placed on the board.\\nSo the values are just integers, not tracking ancestry.\\n\\nBut perhaps we can consider the sum of the values minus the number of values or something.\\nLet me define:\\nLet N = number of numbers on the board. Initially N = n.\\nEach move: remove two, add two → N unchanged. So always n numbers on the board.\\nSum S = sum of numbers. Initially S = n.\\nEach move: S increases by 1, as computed.\\nAfter s moves, S = n + s\\n\\nNow, the average value is (n+s)/n\\n\\nNow, the gcd(a,b) when we pick a and b.\\nNote that gcd(a,b) ≤ min(a,b)\\nBut not very helpful.\\n\\nAnother idea: consider the sum of all pairwise gcds or something, but not clear.\\n\\nPerhaps the key is to notice that the added 1 allows us to control the gcd.\\nFor example, if we always pick a=1 and some b, then gcd(1,b)=1, so we add 1 to t, and 1 to s, so t/s contribution is 1 per move.\\nBut we can do multiple moves.\\n\\nSuppose we always choose to combine 1 with another number.\\nSay, pick a=1, b=x, then replace with 1 and 1+x.\\nSo we remove 1 and x, add 1 and (1+x)\\nNet effect: x is replaced by x+1, and the 1 is restored.\\nSo the multiset changes by increasing one number by 1.\\nAnd we add 1 to s and 1 to t (since gcd(1,x)=1)\\nSo after s such moves, t=s, so t/s=1\\nAnd sum increases by s, from n to n+s, which matches.\\n\\nCan we get other ratios?\\nSuppose we sometimes combine two numbers greater than 1.\\nFor example, suppose we have two equal numbers, say a=a, then gcd(a,a)=a, so if we combine two a's, gcd=a, which could be large.\\nBut to have two a's, we need to create them.\\n\\nFor instance, start with n=3: numbers 1,1,1\\nMove 1: pick two 1's, a=1,b=1, gcd=1, replace with 1 and 1+1=2\\nNow board: 1,1,2  (since we had three 1's, removed two, added 1 and 2, so remaining one 1 plus new 1 and 2 → 1,1,2)\\nSum was 3, now 1+1+2=4, increased by 1, good.\\ns=1, t=1\\nNow move 2: options\\nOption A: pick two 1's: gcd(1,1)=1, replace with 1 and 2\\nNow board: 1,2,2  (removed two 1's, added 1 and 2, so previous 2 remains, plus new 1 and 2 → 1,2,2)\\ns=2, t=1+1=2, t/s=1\\nOption B: pick 1 and 2: gcd(1,2)=1, replace with 1 and 3\\nBoard: 1,1,3? Wait: had 1,1,2; remove one 1 and 2, add 1 and 3 → so remaining one 1, plus new 1 and 3 → 1,1,3\\ns=2, t=1+1=2, t/s=1\\nOption C: pick the other 1 and 2, same as B.\\n\\nNow from 1,2,2 (after move 2A)\\nMove 3: pick two 2's: gcd(2,2)=2, replace with 1 and 4\\nBoard: 1 (the remaining), plus 1 and 4 → 1,1,4\\ns=3, t=1 (first move) +1 (second) +2 (third) =4, t/s=4/3\\nOh! Greater than 1.\\n\\nSo t/s=4/3 is possible for n=3.\\n\\nCan we get higher?\\nFrom 1,1,4\\nMove 4: pick two 1's: gcd=1, replace with 1 and 2 → board: 1,2,4? Had 1,1,4; remove two 1's, add 1 and 2 → so 4 remains, plus new 1 and 2 → 1,2,4\\ns=4, t=4+1=5, t/s=5/4=1.25\\nOr pick 1 and 4: gcd=1, replace with 1 and 5 → board: 1 (other 1), 1,5 → 1,1,5\\ns=4, t=4+1=5, t/s=5/4\\nOr pick 1 and 2: but in 1,2,4, pick 1 and 2: gcd=1, replace with 1 and 3 → board: 4,1,3 → 1,3,4\\ns=4, t=5, ratio 1.25\\n\\nFrom 1,1,4, if we pick the two 1's, get 1,2,4 as above.\\n\\nCan we get two 4's? Not easily.\\n\\nBack to after move 3: we have t/s=4/3≈1.333\\n\\nIs 2 possible? Probably not, since gcd(a,b) ≤ min(a,b) ≤ sum, but sum is n+s, and s moves, but min(a,b) could be large.\\n\\nSuppose we want high gcd.\\nFor example, create two large equal numbers.\\nBut each combination produces a+b and a 1, so the sums grow, but we keep adding 1's, so there are always small numbers.\\n\\nIn the above, we got 4/3.\\n\\nCan we get higher than 4/3 for n=3?\\nAfter having 1,1,4, instead of combining 1's, suppose we could combine 4 with something, but gcd(1,4)=1, small.\\n\\nEarlier, after first move: 1,1,2\\nInstead of combining 1's or 1 and 2, we have to pick two.\\nWe did.\\n\\nStart differently? Only choice at first move: pick any two 1's, same result.\\n\\nSo for n=3, we can achieve t/s=1 (by always combining 1 with other), or 4/3 (by combining the two 2's when possible), or 5/4, etc.\\n\\nBut 5/4=1.25 < 4/3≈1.333, so 4/3 is higher.\\n\\nCan we get 3/2=1.5?\\nSuppose after some moves.\\nFrom 1,1,4, we have sum=6, s=3\\nTo get higher t, need a move with gcd>1.\\nBut current numbers: 1,1,4. Possible pairs: (1,1) gcd=1, (1,4) gcd=1, no pair with gcd>1.\\nSo we cannot get a high gcd move now.\\n\\nAfter move 3 we had 1,1,4, but before that, after move 2 we had 1,2,2, and we combined the two 2's to get gcd=2.\\n\\nSuppose at move 2, we don't combine the two 1's, but combine 1 and 2.\\nFrom after move 1: 1,1,2\\nMove 2: pick 1 and 2, gcd=1, replace with 1 and 3 → board: 1 (remaining), 1,3 → 1,1,3\\ns=2, t=2\\nNow move 3: pick two 1's: gcd=1, replace with 1 and 2 → board: 3,1,2 → 1,2,3\\ns=3, t=3\\nOr pick 1 and 3: gcd=1, replace with 1 and 4 → board: 1,1,4 same as before\\ns=3, t=3, t/s=1\\nWorse than before.\\n\\nSo maximum for n=3 is 4/3.\\n\\nBut we can continue: from 1,1,4, do move 4: pick two 1's → get 1,2,4, s=4,t=5\\nThen move 5: pick 2 and 4? gcd(2,4)=2, replace with 1 and 6 → board: 1 (remaining), 1,6 → 1,1,6\\ns=5, t=5+2=7, t/s=7/5=1.4\\nBetter than 4/3≈1.333\\n7/5=1.4\\n\\nThen move 6: pick two 1's → get 1,2,6? Remove two 1's, add 1 and 2 → so 6 remains, plus new 1 and 2 → 1,2,6\\ns=6, t=7+1=8, t/s=8/6=4/3≈1.333\\nOr pick 1 and 6: gcd=1, get 1,1,7 → s=6,t=8, ratio 8/6=4/3\\nOr pick 1 and 2: gcd=1, get 1,6,3 → 1,3,6\\ns=6,t=8\\n\\nFrom 1,2,6, pick 2 and 6: gcd=2, replace with 1 and 8 → board: 1,1,8\\ns=7, t=8+2=10, t/s=10/7≈1.4286\\nHigher!\\n\\nThen from 1,1,8, pick two 1's: get 1,2,8, s=8,t=11, ratio 11/8=1.375\\nOr pick 1 and 8: gcd=1, get 1,1,9, s=8,t=11, ratio 11/8\\nOr pick 1 and 2: gcd=1, get 1,8,3 → 1,3,8\\ns=8,t=11\\n\\nThen from 1,2,8, pick 2 and 8: gcd=2, get 1,1,10, s=9,t=11+2=13, ratio 13/9≈1.444\\nEven higher.\\n\\nPattern: whenever we have two numbers that are both even, we can combine them for gcd at least 2.\\nIn this sequence, we are repeatedly creating pairs like (2,4),(2,6),(2,8), etc., with gcd=2.\\n\\nBut can we get gcd higher than 2?\\nFor example, if we have two multiples of 3.\\nSuppose we try to make two 3's.\\nStart n=3: 1,1,1\\nMove 1: pick two 1's → get 1,1,2\\nMove 2: pick 1 and 2 → get 1,1,3 (as before)\\nNow we have two 1's and a 3.\\nTo get another 3, we need to combine numbers to make 3.\\nPick two 1's: gcd=1, get 1 and 2 → now board: 3,1,2 → 1,2,3\\nNo two 3's.\\nPick 1 and 3: gcd=1, get 1 and 4 → 1,1,4\\nNo.\\nSo cannot get two 3's easily.\\n\\nSuppose n=4.\\nStart: 1,1,1,1\\nMove 1: pick two 1's → get 1,1,1,2 (removed two 1's, added 1 and 2, so three 1's left? Originally four 1's, remove two, so two left, add one 1 and one 2, so total: two + one = three 1's, and one 2 → 1,1,1,2\\nSum=5, s=1,t=1\\nMove 2: pick two 1's → get 1,1,2,2 (remove two 1's, add 1 and 2, so remaining one 1, plus new 1 and 2, and existing 2 → 1,1,2,2)\\ns=2,t=2\\nMove 3: pick two 2's → gcd=2, replace with 1 and 4 → board: 1,1,1,4 (three 1's and a 4)\\ns=3,t=2+2=4, t/s=4/3\\nSame as before.\\n\\nFrom here, similar to n=3 case.\\n\\nBut we have three 1's, so we can do more.\\nMove 4: pick two 1's → get 1,1,2,4? Remove two 1's, add 1 and 2 → so remaining one 1, plus new 1 and 2, and 4 → 1,1,2,4\\ns=4,t=4+1=5, ratio 5/4\\nThen move 5: pick 2 and 4 → gcd=2, get 1,1,1,6 → s=5,t=5+2=7, ratio 7/5=1.4\\nSame as before.\\n\\nTo get gcd=3, need two multiples of 3.\\nSuppose we make a 3.\\nFrom start n=4: after move 1: 1,1,1,2\\nMove 2: pick 1 and 2 → gcd=1, get 1 and 3 → board: 1,1,1,3 (three 1's and a 3)\\ns=2,t=2\\nNow move 3: pick two 1's → get 1,1,2,3 → s=3,t=3\\nOr pick 1 and 3 → get 1 and 4 → 1,1,1,4\\nOr pick another 1 and 3, same.\\nCannot get two 3's.\\n\\nSuppose we want to make a 6, and another 6, but hard.\\n\\nNote that in the process, the only way to get a number greater than 1 is by summing, and we always add a 1, so the numbers are built from sums, but the 1's are replenished.\\n\\nBack to the ratio.\\nIn the sequences above, we achieved t/s = 1, 4/3, 5/4, 7/5, 10/7, 13/9, ...\\nLook at the fractions: 4/3, 7/5, 10/7, 13/9\\nNumerators: 4,7,10,13 → increase by 3\\nDenominators: 3,5,7,9 → increase by 2\\nSo arithmetic sequence.\\n4/3, then 7/5=1.4, 10/7≈1.428, 13/9≈1.444, next would be 16/11≈1.454, etc.\\n\\nHow are these generated?\\nIn the sequence for n=3: we had after 3 moves: t=4,s=3\\nThen after 5 moves: t=7,s=5\\nFrom s=3 to s=5, two moves: we did move 4: picked two 1's, gcd=1, so t +=1, s+=1\\nThen move 5: picked 2 and 4, gcd=2, t+=2, s+=1\\nSo in two moves, Δt=3, Δs=2, so average 3/2 per two moves, but ratio increase.\\nSpecifically, from (s,t)=(3,4), after two moves: s=5,t=7\\nThen similarly, from (5,7), to get to (7,10): need two moves with Δt=3, Δs=2\\nFor example, from 1,1,6 (after s=5,t=7), do: pick two 1's → gcd=1, get 1,2,6 → s=6,t=8\\nThen pick 2 and 6 → gcd=2, get 1,1,8 → s=7,t=10\\nYes, Δt=3, Δs=2\\nSimilarly, from (7,10) to (9,13): pick two 1's: s=8,t=11, then pick 2 and 8: gcd=2, s=9,t=13\\nAlways possible as long as we have at least two 1's and one even number greater than 2, but in this case, we have numbers like 2k, and we can combine 2 and 2k if we have a 2.\\nBut in the state, after we have 1,1,2k, we can pick two 1's to get 1,2,2k, then pick 2 and 2k to get 1,1,2(k+1)\\nAnd gcd(2,2k)=2, since both even.\\nAnd gcd(two 1's)=1\\nSo each such pair of moves: first gcd=1, second gcd=2, total Δt=3, Δs=2\\nAnd the largest number increases by 2: from 2k to 2(k+1)=2k+2\\nInitially, for n=3, we reached 1,1,4 at s=3,t=4\\n4=2*2\\nThen after each such cycle, it becomes 6,8,10,... even numbers.\\nSo we can continue indefinitely, getting ratios t/s = (4 + 3k)/(3 + 2k) for k=0,1,2,3,...\\nFor k=0: 4/3\\nk=1: 7/5\\nk=2: 10/7\\nk=3: 13/9\\netc.\\nAs k→∞, ratio → 3/2 = 1.5\\n\\nAlso, we can stop at any time, and also we can do moves with gcd=1 only, giving ratio 1.\\nFor example, from any state, if we always pick 1 and another number, gcd=1, then t increases by 1 per move, s by 1, so ratio approaches 1 if we do many such moves.\\nBut since we can do the cycles to increase ratio, and also decrease by doing low gcd moves.\\n\\nBut can we achieve ratios between 1 and 1.5?\\nFor example, 1.2 = 6/5\\nIs it possible?\\nAlso, can we get exactly 3/2?\\nAs limit, but not achieved in finite moves, since (4+3k)/(3+2k) = 3/2 - something, never equals 1.5\\nSet (4+3k)/(3+2k) = 3/2 → 2(4+3k)=3(3+2k) → 8+6k=9+6k → 8=9, impossible.\\nSo never reaches 1.5\\n\\nBut perhaps other sequences give other ratios.\\nFor example, can we get gcd=3?\\nSuppose we make two numbers that are both multiples of 3.\\nFor instance, make a 3 and a 6.\\nStart n=3: 1,1,1\\nMove 1: pick two 1's → 1,1,2\\nMove 2: pick 1 and 2 → 1,1,3\\nNow we have 1,1,3\\nMove 3: pick two 1's → 1,2,3\\nNow pick 1 and 3? gcd=1, get 1 and 4 → 2,1,4 → 1,2,4\\nOr pick 2 and 3: gcd=1, get 1 and 5 → 1,1,5\\nNo gcd>1.\\nFrom 1,1,3, pick 1 and 3 → get 1 and 4 → 1,1,4\\nSame as before.\\n\\nSuppose n=6.\\nStart: six 1's.\\nWe can make multiple 2's.\\nMove 1: pick two 1's → get 1 and 2 → now five 1's and one 2? Total numbers: 6, so 1,1,1,1,1,2\\nBetter: after each such move, we have one less 1 net? No: remove two 1's, add one 1 and one 2, so number of 1's decreases by 1, and we add a 2.\\nStart with six 1's.\\nAfter one move: number of 1's: 6-2+1=5, and one 2.\\nAfter second move: pick two 1's → number of 1's: 5-2+1=4, and two 2's (since add another 2)\\nAfter third: pick two 1's → 1's:4-2+1=3, 2's:2+1=3\\nAfter fourth: pick two 1's → 1's:3-2+1=2, 2's:3+1=4\\nAfter fifth: pick two 1's → 1's:2-2+1=1, 2's:4+1=5\\nNow board: one 1, five 2's\\ns=5, t=5*1=5 (since each move gcd=1), t/s=1\\nNow move 6: pick two 2's → gcd=2, replace with 1 and 4 → now 1's:1+1=2 (the existing one and new one), 2's:5-2=3, and one 4 → so numbers: 1,1,2,2,2,4\\ns=6, t=5+2=7, t/s=7/6≈1.166\\nMove 7: pick two 2's → gcd=2, get 1 and 4 → now 1's:2+1=3, 2's:3-2=1, 4's:1+1=2 → 1,1,1,2,4,4\\ns=7, t=7+2=9, ratio 9/7≈1.285\\nMove 8: pick two 4's → gcd=4, replace with 1 and 8 → now 1's:3+1=4, 2's:1, 4's:2-2=0, one 8 → 1,1,1,1,2,8\\ns=8, t=9+4=13, ratio 13/8=1.625\\nOh! Higher than 1.5\\n13/8=1.625\\n\\nAnd gcd=4>2.\\n\\nSo better.\\nContinue: move 9: pick two 1's → gcd=1, get 1 and 2 → 1's:4-2+1=3, 2's:1+1=2, 8 → 1,1,1,2,2,8\\ns=9,t=14\\nMove 10: pick two 2's → gcd=2, get 1 and 4 → 1's:3+1=4, 2's:2-2=0, 4,8 → 1,1,1,1,4,8\\ns=10,t=16\\nMove 11: pick 4 and 8 → gcd=4, get 1 and 12 → 1's:4+1=5, 4's:1-1=0? Remove 4 and 8, add 1 and 12 → so 4's were one, removed, so no 4, 8 removed, so now 1's:5, and 12 → wait, numbers: five 1's and one 12? But should be six numbers.\\nHad 1,1,1,1,4,8 — six numbers.\\nRemove 4 and 8, add 1 and 12 → so remove two, add two: the four 1's remain, plus new 1 and 12 → so 1,1,1,1,1,12 — five 1's and a 12.\\ns=11,t=16+4=20, ratio 20/11≈1.818\\nHigher!\\n\\nThen move 12: pick two 1's → gcd=1, get 1 and 2 → 1's:5-2+1=4, add 2, so 1,1,1,1,2,12\\ns=12,t=21\\nAnd so on.\\n\\nSo ratios can be higher.\\n\\nIn this case, we got 13/8=1.625, 20/11≈1.818, etc.\\n\\nNow, what is the maximum possible?\\nNotice that gcd(a,b) ≤ min(a,b) ≤ (a+b)/2 by AM-GM, but not tight.\\nBut more importantly, since a and b are positive integers, gcd(a,b) ≤ min(a,b)\\nBut in the sum, we have constraints.\\n\\nAnother idea: consider the sum of the numbers.\\nAfter s moves, sum = n + s\\nAlso, the sum of all numbers is at least the sum of the minimum possible, but not helpful.\\n\\nNote that each number on the board is at least 1, and there are n numbers, sum n+s.\\n\\nBut for gcd, perhaps consider that the total t is sum of gcds over moves.\\n\\nEach move combines two numbers into a sum, but adds a 1, so it's like the 1 is a token.\\n\\nPerhaps model the process as building a tree, but with extra nodes.\\n\\nNotice that every move introduces a new 1, which can be seen as a new leaf or something.\\n\\nAnother thought: the total sum of all numbers ever created or something, but complicated.\\n\\nPerhaps the ratio t/s can be arbitrarily close to some number, or can be any rational in some interval.\\n\\nFrom the examples, for n=3, we got up to almost 1.5, for n=6, we got 20/11≈1.818, and can probably get higher by making larger gcds.\\n\\nFor example, in n=6, after having five 1's and a 12, we can pick two 1's to make a 2, then eventually make another large number, but to get high gcd, we need two large numbers with common divisor.\\n\\nSuppose we make two copies of the same number.\\nFor example, make two 6's.\\nBut how?\\n\\nNote that when we combine a and b, we create a+b, and a 1.\\nSo the new large number is a+b, and we have a spare 1.\\n\\nTo have two identical large numbers, we need to create them separately.\\n\\nFor instance, in n=6, we could first make three 2's from three pairs of 1's.\\nAfter three moves: we have three 2's and three 1's? Start six 1's.\\nMove 1: pick two 1's → get 1 and 2 → now five 1's, one 2\\nMove 2: pick two 1's → get 1 and 2 → four 1's, two 2's\\nMove 3: pick two 1's → get 1 and 2 → three 1's, three 2's\\ns=3,t=3\\nNow move 4: pick two 2's → gcd=2, get 1 and 4 → now 1's:3+1=4, 2's:3-2=1, one 4 → 1,1,1,1,2,4\\ns=4,t=5\\nSame as before.\\n\\nFrom three 1's and three 2's, instead of combining 2's, combine 1 and 2: gcd=1, get 1 and 3 → then we have two 1's, two 2's, one 3, etc.\\nHard to get two same large numbers.\\n\\nSuppose we want to maximize t/s.\\nEach move, the maximum possible gcd is min(a,b), but to achieve high min, we need large numbers, but large numbers are few.\\n\\nNote that gcd(a,b) ≤ a, gcd(a,b) ≤ b, and a and b are at most the sum, but sum is n+s, which grows.\\n\\nBut perhaps the limiting factor is the number of times we can get high gcd.\\n\\nAnother idea: consider the sum of the logs or something, but perhaps not.\\n\\nPerhaps the ratio is always at least 1, and can be arbitrarily large? But probably not, because gcd(a,b) ≤ min(a,b) ≤ sum/2 or something.\\n\\nSuppose at some point, the largest number is M, then gcd(a,b) ≤ M for any pair.\\nBut M can be large, but s is also large.\\n\\nIn the process, the sum is n+s, and there are n numbers, so by pigeonhole, the largest number is at least (n+s)/n\\nBut gcd could be up to that.\\n\\nBut in practice, to get a high gcd move, we need two numbers that share a large common divisor.\\n\\nSuppose we could make two numbers equal to K, then gcd=K, so if we combine them, we get gcd=K, which is large.\\nHow to make two K's?\\nFor example, make a K from summing, but each time we make a large number, we also add a 1, so we have extra 1's.\\nWith enough 1's, we can build another K.\\nFor example, to make a number K, we need to combine numbers summing to K, but each combination reduces the count temporarily, but net, to create a number K, it takes roughly K moves or something? Not necessarily.\\n\\nActually, to create a single number of size K, starting from 1's, in a standard addition chain, it takes about log K moves, but here it's different because we have to maintain n numbers.\\n\\nIn this process, to increase the sum by s, we have sum n+s.\\nTo have a number of size K, it must be that K ≤ n+s.\\nIf we want to combine two numbers of size K, we need 2K ≤ sum = n+s, so K ≤ (n+s)/2\\nThen gcd ≤ K ≤ (n+s)/2\\nWhen we do such a move, we add gcd ≤ (n+s)/2 to t, and 1 to s.\\nBut s is the current number of moves, say s_current.\\nAt that move, sum = n + s_current\\nSo gcd ≤ (n + s_current)/2\\nSo the increment to t is at most (n + s_current)/2\\nBut s_current is large if we do many moves.\\nTo maximize the ratio, we want to do such a move when s_current is small, but then K is small.\\nTrade-off.\\n\\nSuppose we do a move with gcd=g at move number s.\\nThen g ≤ (n+s)/2\\nBut this is for that particular move.\\nTotal t is sum of gcds over s moves.\\nEach gcd_i ≤ (n+i)/2 for the i-th move? Not necessarily, because the sum at move i is n+i, so any number at that time is at most n+i, so gcd ≤ n+i\\nBut more tightly, since there are n numbers, the largest is at most n+i, but gcd of two numbers is at most the minimum, so ≤ n+i\\nBut n+i grows with i.\\n\\nIn fact, gcd_i ≤ n+i for each i\\nSo t = sum_{i=1}^s gcd_i ≤ sum_{i=1}^s (n+i) = n s + s(s+1)/2\\nThen t/s ≤ n + (s+1)/2\\nWhich goes to infinity as s increases, so no upper bound? But that can't be, because in practice gcd is much smaller.\\nFor example, if we always have small numbers, gcd is small.\\nBut if we make large numbers, gcd can be large, but s is large too.\\nIn the inequality, t/s ≤ n + (s+1)/2, which is linear in s, so for fixed s, bounded, but as s increases, it can grow, so t/s can be large.\\nBut is that possible?\\nFor example, can we make t/s very large?\\nSuppose we want to make a very large gcd.\\nSay, make two numbers of size M, then gcd=M, so if we combine them, we get gcd=M, so t increases by M, s by 1.\\nTo have two numbers of size M, sum at least 2M, so n+s >= 2M, so M <= (n+s)/2\\nAt the time of the move, s is s, so M <= (n+s)/2\\nSo gcd = M <= (n+s)/2\\nSo the increment to t is at most (n+s)/2\\nBut s is the current s, say s_c\\nSo Δt <= (n + s_c)/2\\nThen after the move, s_new = s_c +1, t_new = t_old + Δt\\nThe ratio t_new / s_new = (t_old + Δt) / (s_c +1)\\nΔt <= (n + s_c)/2\\nTo make this large, but t_old could be small.\\nSuppose before this move, t_old is small, say we did only moves with gcd=1, so t_old ≈ s_c\\nThen t_new / s_new ≈ (s_c + (n+s_c)/2) / (s_c +1) = [ (2s_c + n + s_c)/2 ] / (s_c +1) = (3s_c + n)/(2(s_c +1)) \\nAs s_c → ∞, this → 3/2 = 1.5\\nIf we do the move early, s_c small, then (3s_c + n)/(2(s_c +1)) is small.\\nFor example, s_c=1, then (3+n)/4, for n>=3, at most (3+3)/4=1.5, but if n large, larger, but s_c=1, can we have two numbers of size M>1? After one move, sum=n+1, numbers include at least n-1 ones (since we combined two 1's into 1 and 2, so if n>2, many 1's), largest number is 2, so M<=2, gcd<=2, while (n+s_c)/2=(n+1)/2, for n>3, larger than 2, so bound not tight.\\nBut in practice, gcd is small when s_c small.\\nSo the ratio after such a move is at most about 1.5 for large s_c.\\nBut earlier with n=6, we got 20/11≈1.818 > 1.5, so contradiction?\\nIn that case, when we did the gcd=4 move, what was s_c?\\nIn the sequence: after move 8: s=8, t=13, board: four 1's, one 2, one 8? Earlier: after move 8: 1,1,1,1,2,8\\nSum=1*4 +2+8=14, n+s=6+8=14, good.\\nThen move 9: pick two 1's, gcd=1, get 1 and 2 → board: 1,1,2,2,2,8? 1's:4-2+1=3, 2's:1+1=2, 8 → wait, previously one 2, add one 2, so two 2's? List: after move 8: 1,1,1,1,2,8\\nRemove two 1's, add 1 and 2 → so remaining two 1's, plus new 1 and 2, and existing 2 and 8 → so 1,1,1,2,2,8 — three 1's, two 2's, one 8\\ns=9,t=13+1=14\\nMove 10: pick two 2's, gcd=2, get 1 and 4 → remove two 2's, add 1 and 4 → so 1's:3+1=4, 2's:2-2=0, 4,8 → 1,1,1,1,4,8\\ns=10,t=14+2=16\\nMove 11: pick 4 and 8, gcd=4, get 1 and 12 → remove 4 and 8, add 1 and 12 → 1's:4+1=5, 12 → so five 1's and one 12\\ns=11,t=16+4=20\\nAt this move, s_c=11, sum= n+s=6+11=17, numbers: five 1's sum 5, one 12, total 17.\\n gcd=4, while (n+s_c)/2 = (6+11)/2=8.5, and 4<8.5, so ok.\\n t_new / s_new = 20/11≈1.818\\nAccording to the formula above, if t_old were s_c=11, but t_old=16 >11, so not small.\\nIn fact, t_old=16, s_c=11, so before the move, t/s=16/11≈1.454\\nAfter move, t/s=20/11≈1.818\\nThe increment Δt=4, while (n+s_c)/2=17/2=8.5>4.\\nTo get higher ratio, we need to do more such moves.\\nFor example, from five 1's and a 12, we can pick two 1's to make a 2, then eventually make another large number.\\nSay, move 12: pick two 1's, gcd=1, get 1 and 2 → now 1's:5-2+1=4, add 2, so 1,1,1,1,2,12\\ns=12,t=21\\nMove 13: pick two 1's, gcd=1, get 1 and 2 → 1's:4-2+1=3, 2's:1+1=2, 12 → 1,1,1,2,2,12\\ns=13,t=22\\nMove 14: pick two 2's, gcd=2, get 1 and 4 → 1's:3+1=4, 2's:2-2=0, 4,12 → 1,1,1,1,4,12\\ns=14,t=24\\nMove 15: pick 4 and 12, gcd=4, get 1 and 16 → 1's:4+1=5, 16 → five 1's, one 16\\ns=15,t=24+4=28, ratio 28/15≈1.866\\nHigher.\\nContinue: move 16: pick two 1's, gcd=1, get 1 and 2 → 1's:5-2+1=4, 2,16 → 1,1,1,1,2,16\\ns=16,t=29\\nAnd so on.\\nWe can keep doing this: each \"cycle\" of several moves culminates in a gcd=4 move, but gcd is always 4 in this case, while the large number is increasing: 12,16,20, etc.\\nWhen we pick 4 and 12, gcd=4, 4 and 16, gcd=4, but if we have 8 and 12, gcd=4, still 4, not increasing.\\nTo get higher gcd, we need the common divisor to be larger.\\nFor example, if we can make two numbers that are both divisible by a large d.\\nSuppose we make a number that is a multiple of a large d.\\nFor example, make a number 6.\\nFrom earlier, we can make a 6.\\nThen if we have another 6, gcd=6.\\nHow to make two 6's?\\nFor example, in n=6, after some moves, we have extra 1's, so we can build another 6 from the 1's.\\nFor instance, start over.\\nAfter having some configuration, but perhaps systematically.\\nSuppose we use some 1's to build a 6.\\nTo build a 6 from 1's, in this process, it takes several moves.\\nFor example, to make a 6: one way: combine 1+1=2 (and add 1), then 2+1=3 (add 1), then 3+3=6 (add 1), but we need two 3's.\\nMake first 3: from 1,1,2: pick 1 and 2 -> 3, but then we have the 3.\\nBut to have two 3's, we need to make another.\\nWith sufficient 1's, we can.\\nFor example, suppose we have at least six 1's available.\\nThen we can make a 6 as follows: but each \"make\" requires moves and consumes numbers.\\nPerhaps calculate the net effect.\\nNotice that in the move, when we combine a and b, we are essentially paying gcd(a,b) stones to the second bucket, and we get a new number a+b and a 1.\\nThe 1 can be used later.\\nIn terms of the sum, we gain 1 in sum per move.\\nFor the ratio t/s, and since we can make gcd as large as we want by making large common divisors, and s can be large, but the ratio may have a supremum.\\nFrom the construction, when we do a gcd=g move, g can be large, but s is also large, and g is roughly proportional to s.\\nIn the earlier construction with gcd=4, we got t/s -> ? In the sequence: after each such gcd=4 move, s increases by 4 or so, t increases by 4, but s increases more.\\nFrom s=11,t=20 (after first gcd=4 move with 4 and 8)\\nThen to next gcd=4 move with 4 and 12: from s=11 to s=15, delta s=4, delta t=8 (from 20 to 28), so average 2 per move, ratio increases from 20/11≈1.818 to 28/15≈1.866\\nThen next: from 1,1,1,1,4,12 at s=14,t=24? After move 14: s=14,t=24, board: 1,1,1,1,4,12\\nThen move 15: pick 4 and 12, gcd=4, get 1 and 16 → s=15,t=28, board: five 1's, 16\\nThen to make another 4: need to create a 4 from 1's.\\nMove 16: pick two 1's, gcd=1, get 1 and 2 → s=16,t=29, board: 1,1,1,2,16 (1's:5-2+1=4, add 2, so 1,1,1,1,2,16? 4 ones, one 2, one 16)\\nMove 17: pick two 1's, gcd=1, get 1 and 2 → s=17,t=30, board: 1,1,2,2,16 (1's:4-2+1=3, 2's:1+1=2, 16)\\nMove 18: pick two 2's, gcd=2, get 1 and 4 → s=18,t=32, board: 1,1,1,4,16 (1's:3+1=4, 4,16)\\nMove 19: pick 4 and 16, gcd=4, get 1 and 20 → s=19,t=36, board: five 1's, 20\\ns=19,t=36, ratio 36/19≈1.8947\\nContinuing, the ratio is increasing: 20/11≈1.818, 28/15≈1.866, 36/19≈1.8947, next will be 44/23≈1.913, etc.\\nDifferences: from s=11 to 15, delta s=4, t from 20 to 28, delta t=8\\ns=15 to 19, delta s=4, t from 28 to 36, delta t=8\\nSo every 4 moves, t increases by 8, s by 4, so t/s increases by approximately 2 per 4 moves, but since s increases, the ratio t/s = (previous t +8)/(previous s +4)\\nLet r_k = t_k / s_k\\nThen r_{k+1} = (t_k +8)/(s_k +4) = (r_k s_k +8)/(s_k +4)\\nAs s_k → ∞, r_{k+1} - r_k → 0, and r_k → L, then L = (L s +8)/(s+4) for large s, which implies L(s+4) = L s +8 → 4L =8 → L=2\\nSo approaches 2.\\nAnd indeed, 20/11≈1.818, 28/15≈1.866, 36/19≈1.8947, 44/23≈1.913, 52/27≈1.9259, 60/31≈1.935, 68/35≈1.942, 76/39≈1.948, 84/43≈1.953, 92/47≈1.957, 100/51≈1.9608, approaching 2.\\nAnd we can get arbitrarily close to 2.\\nMoreover, we can achieve ratios arbitrarily close to 2 by doing many such cycles.\\nAlso, we can achieve ratio 1, as shown.\\nCan we achieve ratios above 2? Probably not, because gcd(a,b) ≤ min(a,b) ≤ (a+b)/2, and a and b are at most the sum, but more carefully.\\nNote that gcd(a,b) ≤ min(a,b) ≤ \\frac{a+b}{2}\\nBut a+b is the sum of the two numbers, not related directly to the total sum.\\nHowever, in the move, when we combine a and b, the sum of all numbers increases by 1, but a and b are part of the current sum.\\nLet S be the sum before the move.\\nThen after move, sum is S+1.\\n gcd(a,b) ≤ min(a,b) ≤ \\frac{a+b}{2}\\nBut a+b could be up to S, if the other numbers are small.\\nSo gcd(a,b) ≤ S/2\\nS = n + s_before, where s_before is the number of moves before this move.\\nLet s be the move number, so before move s, number of moves is s-1, sum = n + (s-1)\\nSo gcd_s ≤ [n + s -1]/2\\nThen t = sum_{i=1}^s gcd_i ≤ sum_{i=1}^s \\frac{n + i -1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} sum_{i=1}^s (n-1 + i) = \\frac{1}{2} [ s(n-1) + \\frac{s(s+1)}{2} ] wait\\nsum_{i=1}^s (n-1 + i) = sum_{j=1}^s (n-1) + sum_{i=1}^s i = s(n-1) + s(s+1)/2\\nSo t ≤ \\frac{1}{2} [ s(n-1) + s(s+1)/2 ] = \\frac{s}{2} (n-1) + \\frac{s(s+1)}{4}\\nThen t/s ≤ \\frac{1}{2}(n-1) + \\frac{s+1}{4}\\nFor fixed n, as s→∞, this →∞, but earlier we saw it approaches 2, so this bound is weak.\\nBut in our construction, it approaches 2, and for n=6, 2 is constant, not depending on n.\\nPerhaps the supremum is 2 for any n≥3.\\nAnd we can approach 2 arbitrarily closely.\\nAlso, we can achieve ratio 1.\\nCan we achieve ratios between 1 and 2?\\nFor example, 1.5.\\nFrom the construction, by doing some high gcd moves and some low, we can probably achieve any rational in [1,2).\\nFor example, to achieve 3/2=1.5, but earlier we couldn't reach exactly, but can get close.\\nSince we can get arbitrarily close to 2, and down to 1, and the set is dense, likely all rationals in [1,2) are achievable, but the problem asks for all possible values, probably meaning the set.\\nBut in the answer, likely they want the interval or the supremum.\\nBut the ratio t/s is a rational number, and we can achieve many values.\\nPerhaps the only possible values are rational numbers in [1,2), but is 2 achievable? Probably not, since gcd(a,b) < min(a,b) if a≠b, but if a=b, gcd=a, but a+b=2a, and we have other numbers.\\nSuppose we have two numbers equal to K, and we combine them, gcd=K, then t increases by K, s by 1.\\nBefore the move, sum S = n + s_before = n + (s-1)\\nThe two numbers sum to 2K, so 2K ≤ S = n+s-1\\nSo K ≤ (n+s-1)/2\\nSo gcd = K ≤ (n+s-1)/2\\nAfter the move, s_new = s, t_new = t_old + K\\n t_old ≥ 0, so t_new / s_new = (t_old + K)/s ≤ (t_old + (n+s-1)/2 ) / s\\nAs s→∞, if t_old /s → L, then ≤ L + (n-1)/(2s) + 1/2 → L + 0.5, not helpful.\\nBut in any case, K ≤ (n+s-1)/2, so t_new / s_new ≤ [t_old + (n+s-1)/2] / s\\nSince t_old ≤ c s for some c, but to have the ratio close to 2, from earlier construction, it approaches 2, but never reaches.\\nMoreover, gcd(a,b) ≤ min(a,b) ≤ \\frac{a+b}{2} < a+b, and a+b is the sum of the two, while the total sum is S, but not directly related.\\nNote that after the move, the new number is a+b, and we add a 1, so the sum increases by 1.\\nBut gcd(a,b) is at most the minimum, and in particular, for the ratio to be 2, we would need t=2s, so sum of gcds =2s.\\nBut each gcd_i ≤ some bound.\\nSuppose that gcd(a,b) ≤ \\frac{a+b}{2} for all a,b, with equality iff a=b.\\nBut a+b is not fixed.\\nIn the entire process, the sum of (a+b) over all moves might be related.\\nEach move, we have a+b for the two numbers combined.\\nBut a and b are removed, a+b is added, so the sum of all numbers increases by 1, as we know.\\nThe sum of (a+b) over moves is sum of the sums of the two numbers selected in each move.\\nLet T = sum over moves of (a_i + b_i)\\nThen T = sum of the values of the two numbers chosen in each move.\\nEach number on the board may be chosen in several moves, but once a number is involved in a move, it is removed, so each number is used in exactly one move as a component, except the numbers that are never chosen, but eventually all might be chosen, but not necessarily.\\nActually, the numbers are constantly changing.\\nEach number that is on the board at some point may be selected in a future move.\\nBut when it is selected, it is removed.\\nAlso, new numbers are added.\\nSpecifically, the initial n ones are each either never selected or selected in some move.\\nBut when two numbers are selected, they are removed, and two new numbers are added: 1 and a+b.\\nThe new 1 is a new number, and a+b is new.\\nSo the \"identity\" is lost.\\nPerhaps think of the total sum of all numbers ever present, but complicated.\\nNote that the sum of the values of all numbers ever created might be large.\\nBut perhaps a better way: consider that for each move, gcd(a,b) ≤ \\frac{a+b}{2}\\nThen t = sum gcd_i ≤ sum \\frac{a_i + b_i}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} sum (a_i + b_i)\\nNow sum over moves of (a_i + b_i) is the sum of the values of the two numbers selected in each move.\\nEach number on the board at any time is selected at most once, since when selected, it is removed.\\nMoreover, every number that is ever on the board is eventually either never selected or selected exactly once.\\nBut some numbers may never be selected if the process stops.\\nSince we can stop at any time, and we want the ratio at that time, so there may be numbers never selected.\\nLet U be the set of numbers that are never selected in any move during the process.\\nThen the sum sum_{moves} (a_i + b_i) = sum of all numbers that are selected at some move.\\nLet V be the sum of all numbers that are ever on the board at some time.\\nBut this includes numbers that are added and later removed.\\nEach number that is created is either in U or is selected in some move.\\nNumbers are created in two ways: initially n ones, and in each move, two new numbers are added: 1 and a+b.\\nSo total numbers created = n + 2s\\nEach of these is either never selected or selected exactly once.\\nLet x be the number of numbers that are never selected.\\nThen number of numbers that are selected = (n + 2s) - x\\nSince each move selects two numbers, the number of selections is 2s.\\nSo 2s = (n + 2s) - x  => x = n\\nSo there are exactly n numbers that are never selected.\\nThese could be from the initial or added later.\\nNow, the sum sum_{moves} (a_i + b_i) = sum of the values of the selected numbers = total sum of all created numbers minus sum of the values of the never-selected numbers.\\nLet W be the sum of the values of all numbers ever created.\\nThen sum (a_i + b_i) = W - Y, where Y is the sum of the values of the never-selected numbers.\\nNow, what is W?\\nInitially, we have n ones, sum n.\\nEach move, we add two numbers: 1 and a+b, so we add 1 + (a+b) to the sum of created numbers.\\nBut the sum of created numbers is cumulative.\\nAt each move, when we add two new numbers, their values are 1 and a+b, so we add 1 + (a+b) to W.\\nInitially W = n (from the initial n ones).\\nAfter each move, W increases by 1 + (a+b)\\nBut a and b are the numbers selected, which are removed, but for W, it's the sum of values at creation, so we add the values of the new numbers.\\nSo after s moves, W = n + sum_{i=1}^s (1 + a_i + b_i)\\nLet S_i = a_i + b_i for the i-th move.\\nThen W = n + sum_{i=1}^s (1 + S_i) = n + s + sum_{i=1}^s S_i\\nNow, sum_{moves} (a_i + b_i) = sum S_i\\nLet T = sum_{i=1}^s S_i\\nThen W = n + s + T\\nAlso, sum (a_i + b_i) = T\\nAnd T = W - Y, where Y is the sum of the never-selected numbers.\\nSo T = (n + s + T) - Y  => Y = n + s\\nNow, Y is the sum of the values of the n never-selected numbers.\\nEach number has value at least 1, so Y ≥ n * 1 = n\\nBut here Y = n + s ≥ n, good.\\nMoreover, since each number is at least 1, Y ≥ n, and equality only if all never-selected numbers are 1.\\nBut Y = n + s, so for s>0, Y > n, so not all are 1; some are greater than 1.\\nNow, back to t ≤ \\frac{1}{2} T = \\frac{1}{2} sum S_i\\nBut T = sum S_i = W - Y = (n + s + T) - Y, which gave Y = n + s, consistent.\\nFrom T = W - Y and W = n + s + T, so T = (n + s + T) - Y => Y = n + s, as above.\\nNow t ≤ \\frac{1}{2} T\\nBut T = sum S_i, and we have no upper bound yet.\\nBut t ≤ \\frac{1}{2} T, and T can be large.\\nFrom the earlier construction, we have t/s → 2, and T/s = sum S_i / s, which in the construction is large.\\nBut we need a lower bound for the ratio.\\nNote that Y = n + s, and Y is sum of n numbers, each at least 1, so by the properties, but for the ratio t/s, we have t ≤ \\frac{1}{2} T, and T = sum S_i\\nBut S_i = a_i + b_i for each move, which is at least 2, so T ≥ 2s, so t ≤ \\frac{1}{2} T ≥ s, so t ≤ something at least s, not helpful for upper bound.\\nFor upper bound of t/s, we need upper bound of t.\\nFrom t ≤ \\frac{1}{2} T, and T = sum S_i, but S_i can be large, so this doesn't give a uniform bound.\\nHowever, in practice, from the construction, t/s < 2, and approaches 2.\\nMoreover, can we achieve t/s = 2?\\nSuppose t/s = 2, so t = 2s.\\nFrom t ≤ \\frac{1}{2} T, so 2s ≤ \\frac{1}{2} T => T ≥ 4s\\nBut T = sum S_i\\nAlso, from earlier, Y = n + s\\nY is sum of n never-selected numbers, each at least 1, so Y ≥ n\\nBut also, since the numbers are positive integers, Y ≤ some function, but no upper bound individually.\\nSuppose that in each move, gcd(a,b) = \\frac{a+b}{2}, which requires a=b, and gcd=a, so a=b, and gcd=a, so a+b=2a, gcd=a, so yes, if a=b, then gcd=a= (a+b)/2.\\nSo equality in the inequality gcd ≤ (a+b)/2 when a=b.\\nSo to have t = \\frac{1}{2} T, we need gcd_i = \\frac{a_i + b_i}{2} for each i, which implies a_i = b_i for each move.\\nSo in every move, we combine two equal numbers.\\nIs this possible?\\nFor example, start with n=3: 1,1,1\\nMove 1: pick two 1's, a=b=1, gcd=1, replace with 1 and 2\\nBoard: 1,1,2  (since one 1 left, plus new 1 and 2)\\nNow numbers: 1,1,2 — not all equal, and no two equal except the two 1's.\\nPicking two 1's: a=b=1, gcd=1, replace with 1 and 2\\nBoard: 2 (existing), 1,2 (new) → 1,2,2\\nNow have two 2's and a 1.\\nPicking two 2's: a=b=2, gcd=2, replace with 1 and 4\\nBoard: 1 (existing), 1,4 → 1,1,4\\nThen picking two 1's: a=b=1, gcd=1, get 1 and 2 → 1,2,4\\nNo two equal.\\nSo we can do three moves with a=b: first two 1's, then two 1's again, then two 2's.\\nAfter three moves: s=3, t=1+1+2=4, t/s=4/3<2\\nThen cannot continue with a=b.\\nFor larger n, we can do more.\\nFor example, n=4: start 1,1,1,1\\nMove 1: pick two 1's → 1,1,1,2 (three 1's, one 2)\\nMove 2: pick two 1's → 1,1,2,2 (two 1's, two 2's)\\nMove 3: pick two 2's → a=b=2, gcd=2, get 1 and 4 → board: 1,1,1,4 (three 1's, one 4)\\nMove 4: pick two 1's → a=b=1, gcd=1, get 1 and 2 → 1,1,2,4\\nThen no more a=b.\\ns=4, t=1+1+2+1=5, t/s=5/4=1.25\\nLess than before.\\nTo have more, need more pairs.\\nSuppose n=6: start 1,1,1,1,1,1\\nMove 1: pick two 1's → 1,1,1,1,1,2 (five 1's, one 2) — after move, five 1's and one 2? As before.\\nBetter: after each such move, number of 1's decreases by 1, number of 2's increases by 1.\\nAfter k such moves, we have (6-k) 1's and k 2's, for k=0 to 6.\\nBut when we pick two 1's, we reduce 1's by 1 net, increase 2's by 1.\\nStart: 6 ones.\\nAfter 1 move: 5 ones, 1 two\\nAfter 2 moves: 4 ones, 2 twos\\n...\nAfter 6 moves: 0 ones, 6 twos\ns=6, t=6*1=6 (since gcd=1 for each), t/s=1\nNow board: six 2's\nMove 7: pick two 2's → a=b=2, gcd=2, get 1 and 4 → now 1's:1, 2's:6-2=4, 4's:1 → 1,2,2,2,2,4\ns=7,t=6+2=8\nMove 8: pick two 2's → a=b=2, gcd=2, get 1 and 4 → 1's:1+1=2, 2's:4-2=2, 4's:1+1=2 → 1,1,2,2,4,4\ns=8,t=8+2=10\nMove 9: pick two 2's → a=b=2, gcd=2, get 1 and 4 → 1's:2+1=3, 2's:2-2=0, 4's:2+1=3 → 1,1,1,4,4,4\ns=9,t=10+2=12\nMove 10: pick two 4's → a=b=4, gcd=4, get 1 and 8 → 1's:3+1=4, 4's:3-2=1, 8 → 1,1,1,1,4,8\ns=10,t=12+4=16\nMove 11: pick two 4's? Only one 4.\nPick two 1's: a=b=1, gcd=1, get 1 and 2 → etc.\ns=10,t=16, t/s=1.6\nThen continue, but not all moves have a=b.\nMaximum t/s in this sequence is 16/10=1.6<2.\nTo get closer to 2, we need to have moves with high gcd, like in the earlier construction where we approached 2.\nIn that construction, we didn't require a=b, but we had gcd=4 while a and b were different, like 4 and 8, gcd=4, while (a+b)/2=6>4, so strict inequality.\nBut we still approached 2.\nNow, can we achieve t/s=2?\nSuppose not, because to have t=2s, and t ≤ \\frac{1}{2} T, so T ≥ 4s\nBut T = sum S_i\nAlso, from earlier, Y = n + s\nY is sum of n never-selected numbers.\nEach never-selected number is at least 1, so Y ≥ n\nBut Y = n + s, so for s>0, Y > n, so some never-selected number is at least 2.\nBut more importantly, the minimal possible Y is n, but here it is n+s, which is larger.\nFor the ratio, perhaps the supremum is 2, and it is approached but not reached.\nMoreover, in the limit, it can be arbitrarily close to 2.\nAlso, we can achieve ratio 1.\nAnd by doing a combination of moves, we can achieve any rational in [1,2).\nFor example, to achieve 1.5, we can do some moves with ratio 1 and some with high ratio to interpolate.\nSince the set is dense in [1,2), and probably all rationals in [1,2) are achievable, but the problem might expect the interval.\nBut the answer format suggests a specific value or set.\nPerhaps for any n≥3, the only possible values are rational numbers in [1,2), but that might not be precise.\nAnother thought: in the never-selected numbers, their sum is Y = n + s\nThe final sum on the board is n + s\nBut the final board has n numbers, sum n+s, which is exactly Y, the sum of the never-selected numbers.\nThe never-selected numbers are exactly the numbers on the board at the end, because the selected numbers are removed and not on the board at the end.\nIs that true?\nAt the end of the process, the numbers on the board are those that were never selected in any move.\nBecause if a number was selected, it was removed.\nAnd the never-selected numbers are precisely those that are on the board at the end.\nYes!\nSo the final board consists of the n never-selected numbers, and their sum is Y = n + s\nBut also, the sum of the final board is n + s, by the sum increase.\nSo consistent.\nNow, each final number is at least 1, sum n+s, so average (n+s)/n\nNow, back to t ≤ \\frac{1}{2} T = \\frac{1}{2} sum S_i\nBut S_i = a_i + b_i for each move.\nNote that for each move, gcd(a,b) ≤ \\min(a,b) \\leq \\frac{a+b}{2}\nBut also, since a and b are positive integers, gcd(a,b) \\leq \\frac{a+b}{2} , with equality iff a=b.\nNow, t = \\sum \\gcd_i \\leq \\sum \\frac{a_i + b_i}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} T\nT = \\sum (a_i + b_i)\nAs above.\nNow, is there a better bound?\nNote that the final sum is n+s, and it is sum of n numbers, each at least 1.\nBut for t/s, we have t ≤ \\frac{1}{2} T, and T is sum of S_i over s moves.\nS_i is the sum of the two numbers selected in move i.\nThese numbers are from the board at that time.\nBut perhaps we can leave it.\nFrom the construction, we can achieve t/s arbitrarily close to 2, and at least 1, and since we can achieve 1 and values close to 2, and by continuity, likely all values in [1,2) are possible.\nFor example, to achieve a ratio r in (1,2), we can do a sequence that gives ratio close to r.\nSince the process allows us to do moves that increase the ratio gradually, we can stop when the ratio is close to r.\nMoreover, since we can make the ratio increase continuously in some sense, probably all values in [1,2) are achievable.\nBut is 1 achievable? Yes, by always combining 1 with another number.\nIs values greater than 1 achievable? Yes.\nIs 2 achievable? Suppose not, because if t/s =2, then t=2s.\nFrom t ≤ \\frac{1}{2} T, so 2s ≤ \\frac{1}{2} T => T ≥ 4s\nT = sum_{i=1}^s S_i\nS_i = a_i + b_i ≥ 2, but more.\nThe final sum is n+s.\nThe sum of all created numbers W = n + s + T\nBut W is also the sum of the values of all created numbers, which is at least the sum of the final board plus the sum of the numbers that were selected and removed.\nThe numbers that were removed are the selected numbers, sum T.\nFinal board sum n+s.\nSo W ≥ (n+s) + T  (since the removed numbers are disjoint from final board)\nBut earlier W = n + s + T\nSo n + s + T ≥ n + s + T, equality.\nSo the only created numbers are the initial and the added ones, and no other, and the sum is exactly accounted for.\nFor t=2s, we need T ≥ 4s\nBut also, from the final board, sum is n+s, with n numbers.\nEach number on the final board is at least 1, so n+s ≥ n, true.\nBut no contradiction yet.\nSuppose that in each move, gcd(a,b) = \\frac{a+b}{2}, which requires a=b.\nThen t = \\frac{1}{2} T\nSo for t=2s, we need \\frac{1}{2} T = 2s => T=4s\nSo sum S_i =4s\nS_i = a_i + b_i =2a_i since a_i=b_i\nSo sum 2a_i =4s => sum a_i =2s\na_i is the value combined.\nBut also, the final sum is n+s.\nNow, is it possible to have sum a_i =2s and final sum n+s.\nFor example, in the n=6 case above, when we had six 2's, s=6, sum a_i for the first 6 moves: each a_i=1 (since combined two 1's), so sum a_i=6*1=6, while 2s=12, not equal.\nLater moves have larger a_i.\nBut in that sequence, T = sum S_i = sum (a_i+b_i) = for first 6 moves: each S_i=1+1=2, sum=12\nThen move 7: S_i=2+2=4, move 8:2+2=4, move 9:2+2=4, move 10:4+4=8, sum T=12+4+4+4+8=32, s=10, 4s=40>32, not sufficient.\nTo have T=4s, need average S_i=4.\nBut in our high-ratio construction, we had T large, but t<s*2.\nFor example, in the n=6 construction, at s=11, t=20, 2s=22>20\nAt s=15, t=28, 2s=30>28\nAt s=19, t=36, 2s=38>36\nAlways t<2s.\nAnd t/s<2.\nMoreover, since gcd(a,b) ≤ \\min(a,b) ≤ \\frac{a+b}{2} < a+b for a,b≥1, and a+b ≥2, but strict inequality unless a=b=1, but even then gcd=1, (a+b)/2=1, equality.\nWhen a=b, gcd=a, (a+b)/2=a, so equality.\nSo gcd(a,b) ≤ \\frac{a+b}{2} with equality iff a=b.\nSo t ≤ \\frac{1}{2} T, with equality iff a_i = b_i for all i.\nNow, if a_i = b_i for all i, then t = \\frac{1}{2} T\nFor t=2s, need \\frac{1}{2} T =2s => T=4s\nBut is it possible to have a_i=b_i for all i and T=4s?\nT= sum S_i = sum 2a_i =2 sum a_i\nSo 2 sum a_i =4s => sum a_i =2s\na_i is the common value in move i.\nNow, the final sum is n+s.\nBut also, the process with a_i=b_i for all i.\nFor example, start with n even, say n=2m.\nThen we can pair the initial 1's into m pairs, each combined to give 1 and 2.\nAfter m moves, we have m 1's and m 2's? After each such move, we have one 1 and one 2 added, but net change in 1's: -1, in 2's: +1.\nStart with 2m ones.\nAfter k moves, we have (2m - k) ones and k twos.\nAfter m moves: m ones and m twos.\ns=m, t=m*1=m (since gcd=1), T= sum S_i = sum (1+1)=2m for each of m moves, so T=2m\n sum a_i = sum 1 =m (since a_i=1 for each move)\n2s=2m, sum a_i=m <2m, not equal.\nThen we can pair the 2's: but we have m twos, so we can do floor(m/2) moves pairing two 2's.\nEach such move: a_i=2, gcd=2, S_i=4\nAfter j such moves, we have m - 2j twos, and j fours, and still m ones.\ns = m + j, t = m + 2j, T = 2m + 4j\n sum a_i = m*1 + j*2 = m+2j\n2s = 2m+2j\n sum a_i = m+2j < 2m+2j for m>0\nContinue, but sum a_i will be less than 2s.\nIn general, sum a_i < 2s for s>0, since initially sum a_i starts from 0, and each move adds a_i to sum a_i, and 1 to s, so sum a_i increases by a_i, s by 1, and a_i ≥1, but usually a_i is small initially.\nTo have sum a_i =2s, we need the average a_i to be 2.\nBut a_i is at least 1, and for early moves, a_i=1, so sum a_i < 2s for small s, and later a_i may be larger, but may not catch up.\nSuppose at some point sum a_i =2s.\nAfter next move, sum a_i new = sum a_i + a_{s+1}, s new = s+1, so sum a_i new = 2s + a_{s+1}, 2s_new = 2s+2, so need a_{s+1} =2\nSimilarly, if a_{s+1}=2, then sum a_i new =2s+2=2(s+1), good.\nSo if we can have a_i=2 for all i, then sum a_i =2s.\nIs it possible to always combine two 2's?\nBut initially we have 1's, not 2's.\nSo first moves must involve 1's.\nFor example, to create a 2, we need to combine two 1's, but then a_i=1 for that move, not 2.\nSo in the first move, a_i=1<2, so sum a_i =1, 2s=2, 1<2.\nAfter that, if we could have a_i=2 for subsequent moves, sum a_i =1 + 2(s-1) =2s -1 <2s for s>1.\nSo always sum a_i ≤ 2s -1 <2s.\nThus sum a_i <2s for all s≥1.\nTherefore, if a_i=b_i for all i, then t = \\frac{1}{2} T = \\frac{1}{2} * 2 sum a_i = sum a_i <2s, so t<2s.\nIf not all a_i=b_i, then t < \\frac{1}{2} T, so even smaller relatively.\nTherefore, t <2s for all s≥1.\nFor s=0, no moves, but s is positive, as given.\nSo t/s <2 for all possible moves.\nAnd we can approach 2 arbitrarily closely, as shown in the construction.\nAlso, t/s ≥1, since gcd(a,b) ≥1 for a,b≥1, so t≥s, t/s≥1.\nAnd we can achieve t/s=1.\nMoreover, by doing a finite number of moves, we can achieve any rational in [1,2), but since the set is dense, and the problem likely expects the interval, or perhaps that the ratio can be any rational in [1,2).\n\nBut in the answer, probably they want the set of possible values.\n\nGiven that in Problem 1, the answer is discrete, but for Problem 2, it might be an interval.\n\nPerhaps the only possible values are 1 and values greater than 1, but we can achieve many.\n\nAnother thought: in the beginning, for any n≥3, we can achieve t/s=1, and also values arbitrarily close to 2, and since the process is flexible, likely all values in [1,2) are possible.\n\nFor example, to achieve 1.5, we can do some moves to get ratio close to 1.5.\n\nSince we can increase the ratio continuously in the construction, we can stop when it's close to 1.5.\n\nMoreover, for any rational r in [1,2), we can achieve it by appropriate sequence.\n\nSo probably the answer is all real numbers in [1,2), but since t/s is rational, all rational numbers in [1,2).\n\nBut the problem asks for \"all possible values\", and in the context, likely they want the interval or the supremum.\n\nPerhaps for each n, the set is the same.\n\nLooking back at the problem, n≥3 is fixed, but the answer might be independent of n.\n\nIn our constructions, for different n, we can achieve the same ratios.\n\nFor example, ratio 1 is achievable for any n.\n\nRatio close to 2 is achievable for n≥3.\n\nFor n=3, in our first construction, we got up to about 1.444, but with more moves, we can get higher.\n\nFor n=3, can we get close to 2?\n\nFor example, start with 1,1,1\n\nDo moves to create larger numbers.\n\nMove 1: pick two 1's -> 1,1,2\n\nMove 2: pick 1 and 2 -> gcd=1, get 1 and 3 -> 1,1,3\n\nMove 3: pick two 1's -> gcd=1, get 1 and 2 -> 1,2,3\n\nMove 4: pick 1 and 2 -> gcd=1, get 1 and 3 -> 1,3,3\n\nNow have two 3's.\n\nMove 5: pick two 3's -> gcd=3, get 1 and 6 -> 1,1,6\n\ns=5, t=1+1+1+1+3=7, t/s=7/5=1.4\n\nMove 6: pick two 1's -> gcd=1, get 1 and 2 -> 1,2,6\n\ns=6,t=8\n\nMove 7: pick 2 and 6 -> gcd=2, get 1 and 8 -> 1,1,8\n\ns=7,t=10, ratio 10/7≈1.428\n\nMove 8: pick two 1's -> gcd=1, get 1 and 2 -> 1,2,8\n\ns=8,t=11\n\nMove 9: pick 2 and 8 -> gcd=2, get 1 and 10 -> 1,1,10\n\ns=9,t=13, ratio 13/9≈1.444\n\nSame as before.\n\nTo get higher, need to make a number with larger common divisor.\n\nFor example, make a 4.\n\nFrom earlier, after move 1: 1,1,2\n\nMove 2: pick two 1's -> gcd=1, get 1 and 2 -> 1,2,2\n\nMove 3: pick two 2's -> gcd=2, get 1 and 4 -> 1,1,4\n\ns=3,t=1+1+2=4, ratio 4/3\n\nThen same as before.\n\nCan we make a 6 without using many 1's.\n\nFrom 1,1,4, pick 1 and 4 -> gcd=1, get 1 and 5 -> 1,1,5\n\nNot helpful.\n\nOr pick two 1's -> 1,2,4\n\nThen pick 2 and 4 -> gcd=2, get 1 and 6 -> 1,1,6\n\ns=4,t=4+2=6, ratio 6/4=1.5\n\nOh! For n=3, at s=4, t=6, t/s=1.5\n\nBetter.\n\nThen continue: from 1,1,6\n\nMove 5: pick two 1's -> gcd=1, get 1 and 2 -> 1,2,6\n\ns=5,t=7\n\nMove 6: pick 2 and 6 -> gcd=2, get 1 and 8 -> 1,1,8\n\ns=6,t=9, ratio 9/6=1.5\n\nMove 7: pick two 1's -> gcd=1, get 1 and 2 -> 1,2,8\n\ns=7,t=10\n\nMove 8: pick 2 and 8 -> gcd=2, get 1 and 10 -> 1,1,10\n\ns=8,t=12, ratio 12/8=1.5\n\nSo we can maintain t/s=1.5\n\nPreviously we had 1.444, now 1.5.\n\nCan we get higher?\n\nFrom 1,1,10, if we could make a number that shares a common divisor with 10, but 10=2*5, so if we make a 5 or 10 or 15, etc.\n\nMake a 5: from 1,1,10, pick two 1's -> get 1,2,10\n\nThen pick 1 and 2 -> gcd=1, get 1 and 3 -> 1,3,10\n\nNot helpful.\n\nPick 2 and 10 -> gcd=2, get 1 and 12 -> 1,1,12\n\ns=9,t=12+2=14, ratio 14/9≈1.555\n\nHigher!\n\nThen from 1,1,12, pick two 1's -> get 1,2,12\n\ns=10,t=15\n\nPick 2 and 12 -> gcd=2, get 1 and 14 -> 1,1,14\n\ns=11,t=17, ratio 17/11≈1.545\n\nLower.\n\nFrom 1,2,12, pick 1 and 2 -> gcd=1, get 1 and 3 -> 1,3,12\n\ns=10,t=15\n\nThen pick 3 and 12 -> gcd=3, get 1 and 15 -> 1,1,15\n\ns=11,t=15+3=18, ratio 18/11≈1.636\n\nHigher!\n\nThen continue: from 1,1,15, pick two 1's -> get 1,2,15\n\ns=12,t=19\n\nPick 2 and 15 -> gcd=1, get 1 and 17 -> 1,1,17\n\ns=13,t=20, ratio 20/13≈1.538\n\nOr pick 1 and 2 -> gcd=1, get 1 and 3 -> 1,3,15\n\ns=12,t=19\n\nPick 3 and 15 -> gcd=3, get 1 and 18 -> 1,1,18\n\ns=13,t=19+3=22, ratio 22/13≈1.692\n\nEven higher.\n\nThen from 1,1,18, pick two 1's -> get 1,2,18\n\ns=14,t=23\n\nPick 2 and 18 -> gcd=2, get 1 and 20 -> 1,1,20\n\ns=15,t=25, ratio 25/15=5/3≈1.666\n\nOr pick 1 and 2 -> gcd=1, get 1 and 3 -> 1,3,18\n\ns=14,t=23\n\nPick 3 and 18 -> gcd=3, get 1 and 21 -> 1,1,21\n\ns=15,t=23+3=26, ratio 26/15≈1.733\n\nHigher.\n\nAnd so on. By choosing to make a number that shares a large common divisor with the large number, we can get higher ratios, and approach 2.\n\nFor example, when we have 1,1,K, we can make a number d that divides K, then combine to get gcd=d.\n\nBy making d large, gcd large.\n\nFor instance, make d=K/2 if K even, but may not be integer.\n\nIn the above, we made d=3 when K=15, gcd=3, while K=15, so gcd=3.\n\nWe could make d=5, if we want.\n\nFor example, from 1,1,15, instead of making 3, make 5.\n\nHow? Pick two 1's -> get 1,2,15\n\nPick two 1's? Only one 1 left? After first pick, we have 1,2,15\n\nThen pick 1 and 2 -> gcd=1, get 1 and 3 -> 1,3,15\n\nThen to make 5, need to combine to make 5.\n\nFrom 1,3,15, pick 1 and 3 -> gcd=1, get 1 and 4 -> 1,4,15\n\nThen pick 1 and 4 -> gcd=1, get 1 and 5 -> 1,5,15\n\ns=12,t=19+1+1=21? Let's calculate.\n\nAfter s=11, t=18, board: 1,1,15\n\nMove 12: pick two 1's -> gcd=1, get 1 and 2 -> board: 2,15,1? 1,2,15\n\ns=12,t=19\n\nMove 13: pick 1 and 2 -> gcd=1, get 1 and 3 -> 1,3,15\n\ns=13,t=20\n\nMove 14: pick 1 and 3 -> gcd=1, get 1 and 4 -> 1,4,15\n\ns=14,t=21\n\nMove 15: pick 1 and 4 -> gcd=1, get 1 and 5 -> 1,5,15\n\ns=15,t=22\n\nMove 16: pick 5 and 15 -> gcd=5, get 1 and 20 -> 1,1,20\n\ns=16,t=22+5=27, ratio 27/16=1.6875\n\nCompared to earlier when we did 3 and 15, gcd=3, t=26/15≈1.733, which is higher than 1.6875, so better to make a smaller d with larger gcd relative, but in this case gcd=5>3, but s increased more.\n\n27/16=1.6875 < 26/15≈1.733, so worse.\n\nTo maximize, we should make a number that has large gcd with K, but with few moves.\n\nFor example, if K is even, make a 2, gcd=2.\n\nIf K divisible by 3, make a 3, gcd=3, etc.\n\nIn the case where K is highly composite, we can make a large divisor.\n\nBut in any case, we can get arbitrarily close to 2.\n\nFor example, make a number d that is a large divisor of K, but to make d, it takes about d moves or something, but in this process, to make a number d, it takes roughly d moves if we use only 1's, but we have to account for the 1's.\n\nIn the process, to create a number of size d, it takes at least d-1 moves or something, but in this case, since we have to maintain the board, it might take more.\n\nBut in practice, from the constructions, we can get t/s arbitrarily close to 2.\n\nAnd since t/s <2, and >=1, and dense in [1,2), likely the set of possible values is all rational numbers in [1,2).\n\nBut for the answer, perhaps they want the interval [1,2).\n\nGiven that in many such problems, the answer is the interval.\n\nPerhaps only 1 and 2 are possible, but we have values in between.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the ratio is always an integer, but no, we have 4/3, etc.\n\nSo for Problem 1, the answer is the three triples: (2,5,3), (3,2,5), (5,3,2)\n\nFor Problem 2, the possible values of t/s are all rational numbers in the interval [1,2).\n\nBut to confirm, can we achieve t/s=1.2=6/5?\n\nFor example, do some moves with gcd=1 and some with higher.\n\nSuppose for n=3, do 5 moves.\n\nWant t=6, s=5.\n\nFor example, do four moves with gcd=1, t=4, then one move with gcd=2, t=6.\n\nIs it possible?\n\nStart: 1,1,1\n\nMove 1: pick two 1's -> gcd=1, get 1,1,2\n\nMove 2: pick 1 and 2 -> gcd=1, get 1,1,3\n\nMove 3: pick two 1's -> gcd=1, get 1,2,3\n\nMove 4: pick 1 and 2 -> gcd=1, get 1,3,3\n\nMove 5: pick two 3's -> gcd=3>2, t=1+1+1+1+3=7>6\n\nToo big.\n\nAfter move 4: 1,3,3\n\nInstead of combining 3's, combine 1 and 3 -> gcd=1, get 1,3,4\n\ns=5,t=5, ratio 1.\n\nNot 6.\n\nAfter move 2: 1,1,3\n\nMove 3: pick 1 and 3 -> gcd=1, get 1,1,4\n\ns=3,t=3\n\nMove 4: pick two 1's -> gcd=1, get 1,2,4\n\ns=4,t=4\n\nMove 5: pick 2 and 4 -> gcd=2, get 1,1,6\n\ns=5,t=6, yes! t/s=6/5=1.2\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo achievable.\n\nSimilarly, any rational in [1,2) can probably be achieved.\n\nTherefore, for Problem 2, the possible values are all rational numbers in [1,2).\n\nBut since the answer might expect a boxed interval, or perhaps they want the supremum, but the problem says \"find all possible values\".\n\nIn the context, perhaps they want the interval.\n\nMaybe only the values that are always possible, but it depends on n, but for each n≥3, the set is the same.\n\nSo I think the answer is all real numbers in [1,2), but since t/s is rational, all rational numbers in [1,2).\n\nBut in the answer format, perhaps write the interval.\n\nFor Problem 1, the ordered triples are (2,5,3), (3,2,5), (5,3,2).\n\nSo final answer.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"(2,5,3), (3,2,5), (5,3,2)\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"[1,2)\"\n}",
