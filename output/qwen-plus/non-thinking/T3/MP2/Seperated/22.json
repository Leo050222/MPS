Wait: 30 = 2×3×5 → largest prime is 5 → a_{10} = 5\\n\\nS_{10} = 35 → 35 = 5×7 → lpd = 7 → a_{11} = 7\\n\\nS_{11} = 35 + 7 = 42 → lpd(42) = 7 → a_{12} = 7\\n\\nS_{12} = 49 → 49 = 7² → lpd = 7 → a_{13} = 7\\n\\nS_{13} = 56 → 56 = 8×7 → lpd = 7 → a_{14} = 7\\n\\nS_{14} = 63 → 63 = 7×9 → lpd = 7 → a_{15} = 7\\n\\nS_{15} = 70 → 70 = 2×5×7 → lpd = 7 → a_{16} = 7\\n\\nS_{16} = 77 → 77 = 7×11 → lpd = 11 → a_{17} = 11\\n\\nS_{17} = 77 + 11 = 88 → lpd(88) = 11 → a_{18} = 11\\n\\nS_{18} = 99 → 99 = 9×11 → lpd = 11 → a_{19} = 11\\n\\nS_{19} = 110 → 110 = 10×11 → lpd = 11 → a_{20} = 11\\n\\nS_{20} = 121 → 121 = 11² → lpd = 11 → a_{21} = 11\\n\\nS_{21} = 132 → 132 = 12×11 → lpd = 11 → a_{22} = 11\\n\\nS_{22} = 143 → 143 = 11×13 → lpd = 13 → a_{23} = 13\\n\\nNow we see a pattern:\\n- The sum increases until it reaches a multiple of a new prime squared or a product that introduces a larger prime.\\n- Each time, a_{n+1} becomes the next prime after a run of repeated values.\\n- The sequence stays constant at a prime p for several steps until the sum becomes divisible by a larger prime.\\n\\nBut notice: once a new prime q appears as a_{k}, then S_{k-1} must have had q as its largest prime factor. Then S_k = S_{k-1} + q, and so on.\\n\\nHowever, observe from above:\\n- After a_3 = 3, we keep getting 3s until sum reaches 15 → then jump to 5\\n- Then 5s until sum reaches 35 → jump to 7\\n- Then 7s until sum reaches 77 → jump to 11\\n- Then 11s until sum reaches 143 → jump to 13\\n\\nWait: 143 = 11×13 → yes, largest prime is 13 → a_{23}=13\\n\\nS_{23} = 143 + 13 = 156 → 156 = 12×13 → lpd=13 → a_{24}=13\\n\\nS_{24}=169=13² → a_{25}=13\\n\\nS_{25}=182=14×13 → lpd=13 → a_{26}=13\\n\\nS_{26}=195=15×13 → lpd=13 → a_{27}=13\\n\\nS_{27}=208=16×13 → lpd=13 → a_{28}=13\\n\\nS_{28}=221=13×17 → 221 ÷ 13 = 17 → yes → lpd=17 → a_{29}=17\\n\\nSo now: each time, when the sum becomes divisible by a new prime times current prime, and that new prime is larger, it becomes the next term.\\n\\nPattern:\\nThe sequence remains constant at a prime p for several steps, and when the sum reaches p × q where q > p is prime, then next term becomes q.\\n\\nThe values of a_n are non-decreasing primes.\\n\\nList of transitions:\\n- a_3 = 3\\n- a_7 = 5 (after sum=15=3×5)\\n- a_{11} = 7 (sum=35=5×7)\\n- a_{17} = 11 (sum=77=7×11)\\n- a_{23} = 13 (sum=143=11×13)\\n- a_{29} = 17 (sum=221=13×17)\\n\\nCheck indices: 3,7,11,17,23,29 — these are primes themselves?\\n3,7,11,17,23,29 — all primes, but not consecutive.\\n\\nLook at positions where new prime starts:\\n- 3 starts at n=3\\n- 5 at n=7\\n- 7 at n=11\\n- 11 at n=17\\n- 13 at n=23\\n- 17 at n=29\\n\\nDifferences between starting indices:\\n7-3=4, 11-7=4, 17-11=6, 23-17=6, 29-23=6 → not clear.\\n\\nAlternatively, note the sum at transition:\\nWhen we switch from p to q, it's because S_n = p×q, and q is the next odd prime after p? Not exactly: from 3→5 (gap 2), 5→7 (2), 7→11 (4), 11→13 (2), 13→17 (4)\\n\\nBut more importantly, how many times does each prime repeat?\\n- 3: from n=3 to n=6 → a_3 to a_6 → 4 terms? Wait:\\na_3=3, a_4=3, a_5=3, a_6=3 → 4 terms\\nThen a_7=5\\n- 5: a_7 to a_{10} → 4 terms\\n- 7: a_{11} to a_{16} → 6 terms\\n- 11: a_{17} to a_{22} → 6 terms\\n- 13: a_{23} to a_{28} → 6 terms\\n- 17: starts at a_{29}\\n\\nWait: 3: 4 terms (n=3 to 6)\\n5: 4 terms (7 to 10)\\n7: 6 terms (11 to 16)\\n11: 6 terms (17 to 22)\\n13: 6 terms (23 to 28)\\n17: ?\\n\\nS_{28} = sum up to a_{28} = previous S_{27}=208? No:\\nLet’s track cumulative sum carefully.\\n\\nInstead, notice: each time a prime p is introduced, it is added k times until the sum becomes divisible by a larger prime.\\n\\nBut from the recurrence, once a_{n+1} = p, then S_n has largest prime factor p.\\nThen S_{n+1} = S_n + p\\nS_{n+2} = S_n + 2p\\n...\\nEach time we add p, so the sum increases by p each step.\\n\\nSo suppose at some point, S_k = M, and a_{k+1} = p (largest prime factor of M)\\nThen a_{k+2} = lpd(M + p)\\na_{k+3} = lpd(M + 2p)\\netc.\\n\\nWe stay with value p as long as the largest prime factor of the current sum is p.\\nBut actually, a_{n+1} depends on sum up to a_n, so:\\nAfter setting a_{k+1} = p, then sum becomes M + p\\nThen a_{k+2} = lpd(M + p)\\nWe want this to be p again, so lpd(M + p) = p ⇒ M + p is composed of primes ≤ p, and p divides it.\\nSimilarly for next.\\n\\nBut in our earlier computation, once p is introduced, it repeats several times.\\n\\nFrom earlier:\\nAfter a_3 = 3, S_3 = 6\\nThen a_4 = lpd(6) = 3 → S_4 = 9\\na_5 = lpd(9)=3 → S_5=12\\na_6 = lpd(12)=3 → S_6=15\\na_7 = lpd(15)=5 → since 15=3×5\\n\\nSo sum went: 6,9,12,15 — all multiples of 3, increasing by 3 each time.\\nSimilarly, after a_7=5, S_7=15+5=20\\na_8=lpd(20)=5 → S_8=25\\na_9=lpd(25)=5 → S_9=30\\na_{10}=lpd(30)=5 → S_{10}=35\\na_{11}=lpd(35)=7 → since 35=5×7\\n\\nSum: 20,25,30,35 — increase by 5 each time.\\nSimilarly: after a_{11}=7, S_{11}=35+7=42\\nThen S_{12}=49, S_{13}=56, S_{14}=63, S_{15}=70, S_{16}=77\\na_{17}=lpd(77)=11 → 77=7×11\\n\\nSo sum increases by 7: 42,49,...,77 — how many steps? From 42 to 77, step 7: (77-42)/7 = 5, so 6 terms? S_{11}=42, S_{12}=49, ..., S_{16}=77 → that's 6 sums, meaning a_{12} to a_{17}: a_{17} is based on S_{16}=77\\na_{17} = lpd(S_{16}) = lpd(77)=11\\n\\nSo the sum during the '7' phase: started at S_7=20? No:\\nClarify:\\n- After a_7=5, S_7 = sum_{i=1}^7 a_i = 1+2+3+3+3+3+5 = let's compute properly.\\n\\nBetter to tabulate:\\n\\nn | a_n | S_n = sum_{k=1}^n a_k\\n1 | 1   | 1\\n2 | 2   | 3\\n3 | 3   | 6\\n4 | 3   | 9\\n5 | 3   | 12\\n6 | 3   | 15\\n7 | 5   | 20\\n8 | 5   | 25\\n9 | 5   | 30\\n10| 5   | 35\\n11| 7   | 42\\n12| 7   | 49\\n13| 7   | 56\\n14| 7   | 63\\n15| 7   | 70\\n16| 7   | 77\\n17|11   | 88\\n18|11   | 99\\n19|11   |110\\n20|11   |121\\n21|11   |132\\n22|11   |143\\n23|13   |156\\n24|13   |169\\n25|13   |182\\n26|13   |195\\n27|13   |208\\n28|13   |221\\n29|17   |238\\n30|17   |255\\n... continue?\\n\\nS_{28}=221, a_{29}=lpd(221). 221÷13=17, so 13×17, lpd=17 → a_{29}=17\\nS_{29}=221+17=238\\na_{30}=lpd(238). 238=2×119=2×7×17 → lpd=17 → a_{30}=17\\nS_{30}=238+17=255\\na_{31}=lpd(255)=255=5×51=5×3×17 → lpd=17 → a_{31}=17\\nS_{31}=272\\na_{32}=lpd(272)=272=16×17 → 2^4×17 → lpd=17 → a_{32}=17\\nS_{32}=289\\n289=17² → lpd=17 → a_{33}=17\\nS_{33}=306\\n306=18×17 → lpd=17 → a_{34}=17\\nS_{34}=323\\n323 ÷ 17 = 19 → yes, 17×19=323 → lpd=19 → a_{35}=19\\n\\nSo new prime 19 at n=35.\\n\\nNow list the starting indices of each prime:\\n- 3: n=3\\n- 5: n=7\\n- 7: n=11\\n- 11: n=17\\n- 13: n=23\\n- 17: n=29\\n- 19: n=35\\n\\nSequence of starting indices: 3,7,11,17,23,29,35\\nDifferences: 4,4,6,6,6,6\\nAfter first two, differences are 6.\\n\\nBut 3 to 7: +4, 7 to 11: +4, 11 to 17: +6, 17 to 23: +6, 23 to 29: +6, 29 to 35: +6\\nSo after n=11, increases by 6 each time.\\n\\nThe primes: 3,5,7,11,13,17,19 — just the odd primes in order.\\nYes: 3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,... all primes ≥3.\\n\\nSo the sequence a_n takes on successive odd primes, each starting at a certain index.\\n\\nLet p_k be the k-th odd prime: p1=3, p2=5, p3=7, p4=11, p5=13, p6=17, p7=19, p8=23, etc.\\n\\nStart index s_k for p_k:\\ns1=3, s2=7, s3=11, s4=17, s5=23, s6=29, s7=35\\n\\ns1=3\\ns2=7 = s1 + 4\\ns3=11 = s2 + 4\\ns4=17 = s3 + 6\\ns5=23 = s4 + 6\\ns6=29 = s5 + 6\\ns7=35 = s6 + 6\\n\\nSo after k=3, increment by 6.\\n\\nHow many terms for each prime?\\nFor p_k, number of times it appears is s_{k+1} - s_k\\n- p1=3: s2-s1=7-3=4 terms (n=3,4,5,6)\\n- p2=5: s3-s2=11-7=4 terms (n=7,8,9,10)\\n- p3=7: s4-s3=17-11=6 terms (n=11 to 16)\\n- p4=11: s5-s4=23-17=6 terms (17-22)\\n- p5=13: s6-s5=29-23=6 terms (23-28)\\n- p6=17: s7-s6=35-29=6 terms (29-34)\\n- p7=19: will last 6 terms? s8 = s7 + 6 = 41? But wait, earlier pattern changed.\\n\\nBut from k≥3, increment is 6, so s_k = s3 + 6(k-3) for k≥3?\\ns3=11\\ns4=11+6=17, s5=23, s6=29, s7=35, s8=41, s9=47, etc.\\n\\nBut s1=3, s2=7, not fitting.\\n\\nNote that s_k for k≥1: 3,7,11,17,23,29,35,41,...\\nAfter s3=11, it increases by 6 each time.\\nSo for k≥4, s_k = 11 + 6(k-3) = 6k -7?\\nCheck: k=4: 6*4-7=24-7=17 ✓\\nk=5:30-7=23 ✓\\nk=6:36-7=29 ✓\\nk=7:42-7=35 ✓\\nk=8:48-7=41 ✓\\n\\nBut k=3: 6*3-7=11 ✓\\nk=2:12-7=5 ≠7 ✗\\nk=1:6-7=-1 ✗\\nSo for k≥3, s_k = 6k -7\\n\\nk=3:18-7=11 ✓\\nk=4:24-7=17 ✓\\nYes.\\n\\nNow what about k=1 and 2? They are exceptions.\\n\\nWe need a_{100}. So find which prime block contains n=100.\\n\\nFirst, list the start indices:\\np1=3: s1=3, lasts 4 terms → n=3 to 6\\np2=5: s2=7, lasts 4 terms → n=7 to 10\\np3=7: s3=11, and s_k=6k-7 for k≥3\\ns3=6*3-7=11 ✓\\nNumber of terms for each p_k, k≥3: s_{k+1} - s_k = [6(k+1)-7] - [6k-7] = 6k+6-7 -6k +7 = 6\\nSo for k≥3, each prime appears for 6 terms.\\n\\nNow, the end of p2 block: n=10\\nThen p3 starts at n=11\\np3: n=11 to 16\\np4:17-22\\np5:23-28\\np6:29-34\\np7:35-40\\np8:41-46\\np9:47-52\\np10:53-58\\np11:59-64\\np12:65-70\\np13:71-76\\np14:77-82\\np15:83-88\\np16:89-94\\np17:95-100\\n\\ns_k = 6k -7 for k≥3\\ns17 = 6*17 -7 = 102-7=95\\nSo p17 starts at n=95\\nAnd lasts 6 terms: n=95,96,97,98,99,100\\nSo a_{100} is the 6th term in the p17 block, so it is p17.\\n\\nWhat is p17? The 17th odd prime.\\nOdd primes: 3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,...\\nList:\\n1:3\\n2:5\\n3:7\\n4:11\\n5:13\\n6:17\\n7:19\\n8:23\\n9:29\\n10:31\\n11:37\\n12:41\\n13:43\\n14:47\\n15:53\\n16:59\\n17:61\\n\\nSo p17=61\\nThus a_{100}=61\\n\\nConfirm: s17=6*17-7=102-7=95 ✓\\nBlock: n=95 to 100 → 6 terms, yes.\\nSo a_{100}=61\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe have 5 lattice points in the plane, no three collinear. We form C(5,3)=10 triangles. We want the minimum possible number of these triangles that have area > 1/2.\\n\\nBy Pick's Theorem, for a lattice polygon, Area = I + B/2 - 1, where I = interior lattice points, B = boundary lattice points.\\n\\nFor a triangle with vertices on lattice points, area is at least 1/2 (by formula: |det|/2 for vectors, minimum non-zero is 1/2).\\n\\nA lattice triangle has area ≥ 1/2, and area = 1/2 if and only if there are no other lattice points inside or on the boundary except the vertices (i.e., I=0, B=3, so Area=0+3/2-1=1/2).\\n\\nSuch a triangle is called a primitive or empty lattice triangle.\\n\\nWe want to minimize the number of triangles with area > 1/2, which is equivalent to maximizing the number of triangles with area exactly 1/2.\\n\\nSo we want as many of the 10 triangles as possible to have area 1/2.\\n\\nIs it possible for all 10 to have area 1/2? Probably not, due to geometric constraints.\\n\\nKnown result: any set of lattice points, the number of empty triangles.\\n\\nTry small configurations.\\n\\nSuppose all 5 points are in convex position, forming a convex pentagon.\\n\\nOr one point inside a quadrilateral.\\n\\nCase 1: 4 points form a convex quadrilateral, one inside.\\n\\nTo maximize empty triangles, we want many triples to form empty triangles.\\n\\nClassic example: take a 2x2 grid. Points: (0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(2,0)\\nBut check if three collinear: (0,0),(1,0),(2,0) are collinear — not allowed.\\n\\nAvoid three collinear.\\n\\nTake points: (0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(2,1)\\nNow check collinearity: (1,0),(1,1),(1,2)? No (1,2) not present.\\n(0,0),(1,0),(2,1)? Not collinear.\\n(0,1),(1,1),(2,1) — oh, (0,1),(1,1),(2,1) are collinear if we have (2,1), but we do: (2,1) is included.\\nPoints: A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0,1), D(1,1), E(2,1)\\nThen C(0,1), D(1,1), E(2,1) are collinear — not allowed.\\n\\nShift: use (0,0),(2,0),(0,2),(2,2),(1,1) — center.\\nPoints: A(0,0), B(2,0), C(0,2), D(2,2), E(1,1)\\nNo three collinear? Check:\\nA,B,E: (0,0),(2,0),(1,1) — slope AB=0, AE=1, not same.\\nA,C,E: (0,0),(0,2),(1,1) — AC vertical, AE slope 1.\\nB,D,E: (2,0),(2,2),(1,1) — BD vertical.\\nA,D,E: (0,0),(2,2),(1,1) — these three: (0,0),(2,2),(1,1) — are collinear! Since (1,1) is midpoint.\\nOh, bad.\\n\\nTo avoid, move E to (1,0), but then may have collinearity.\\nUse (0,0),(3,0),(0,3),(3,3),(1,1) — but still (0,0),(3,3),(1,1) may not be collinear?
