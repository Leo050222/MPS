We want the probability that each role is chosen by exactly 2 players.\\n\\nStep 1: Total number of ways each player chooses 2 roles\\nEach player selects 2 out of 5 roles. The number of such combinations for one player is C(5,2) = 10.\\nSince there are 5 players, and choices are independent, total number of possible choice combinations is 10^5.\\n\\nStep 2: Favorable outcomes — each role is selected by exactly 2 players\\nWe need to count the number of assignments where each of the 5 roles is selected by exactly 2 players, and each player selects exactly 2 roles.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to constructing a 5×5 bipartite multigraph (or incidence matrix) between players and roles, but more precisely, we can model this as a combinatorial design.\\n\\nLet’s define it as a (0,1)-matrix with:\\n- 5 rows (players)\\n- 5 columns (roles)\\n- Each row has exactly two 1s (each player picks 2 roles)\\n- Each column has exactly two 1s (each role is picked by 2 players)\\n\\nSo we are counting the number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with row sums = 2 and column sums = 2.\\n\\nThis is a standard problem in combinatorics: counting regular bipartite graphs.\\n\\nThe number of 5×5 binary matrices with all row and column sums equal to 2.\\n\\nThis is known and can be computed via formula or enumeration.\\n\\nThe number of such matrices is equal to the number of 2-regular bipartite graphs on (5,5), which is the same as the number of 2-factors in K_{5,5}, but since both sides have size 5, and each node degree 2.\\n\\nAlternatively, this is equivalent to the number of biregular bipartite graphs with degrees (2,2).\\n\\nA known formula or OEIS sequence can help, but let's compute it.\\n\\nWe can think of this as a double counting of 2-regular digraphs or as a configuration model.\\n\\nBut an easier way: This is the same as the number of 2-regular hypergraphs or, better, use the formula for the number of such matrices.\\n\\nThe number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums all equal to 2 is given by a known value.\\n\\nFrom combinatorics, the number is:\\n\\n\\\\frac{1}{(2!)^5} \\\\times \\\\text{coefficient of } x_1^2x_2^2...x_5^2 y_1^2y_2^2...y_5^2 \\\\text{ in } \\\\prod_{i,j} (1 + x_i y_j)\\n\\nBut this is complicated.\\n\\nAlternatively, use known values.\\n\\nOEIS A001501 gives the number of 5×5 binary matrices with row and column sums equal to 2: it is 120.\\nWait, let me verify.\\n\\nActually, the number of such matrices is equal to the number of ways to decompose the complete bipartite graph into 2-factors, but no.\\n\\nAnother approach: This is equivalent to the number of 2-regular bipartite graphs with 5+5 vertices, each of degree 2.\\n\\nBut each connected component is an even cycle.\\n\\nTotal number of such matrices can be computed via:\\n\\nUse the formula:\\n\\nNumber = \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma \\\\in S_5} \\\\prod_{i=1}^5 \\\\binom{5}{2}^{-1} ? No.\\n\\nBetter: Use the configuration model or recursion.\\n\\nKnown result: The number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with row and column sum 2 is 120? Let's calculate.\\n\\nWe can model this as arranging 10 ones in the matrix (since 5 rows × 2 = 10), such that each column also has 2.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to a regular bipartite graph of degree 2 on both sides.\\n\\nSuch a graph consists of disjoint cycles covering all vertices, with even length.\\n\\nPossible cycle structures:\\n- One 10-cycle\\n- An 8-cycle and a 2-cycle → impossible (2-cycle would mean two vertices connected twice, but simple graph)\\nWait, but we are allowing only simple edges (no multiple selections per role per player), so no multiple edges.\\nThus, the graph is simple, so no multiple edges.\\n\\nSo possible partitions of 5 vertices on each side into cycles of even length ≥4.\\n\\nPossible cycle type decompositions:\\n- One 10-cycle\\n- A 6-cycle and a 4-cycle\\n- Two 4-cycles and one fixed point? No, 4+4=8 vertices, need 10.\\nWait, total 10 vertices (5 players + 5 roles).\\n\\nCycles must alternate between players and roles.\\n\\nSo possible cycle decompositions:\\n1. One 10-cycle\\n2. A 6-cycle and a 4-cycle\\n3. Two 4-cycles and a 2-cycle → invalid (2-cycle not possible in bipartite)\\n4. A 8-cycle and a 2-cycle → invalid\\nSo only possibilities: 10-cycle, or 6+4.\\n\\nNow count number of such graphs.\\n\\nFirst, count number of ways to partition the 5 players and 5 roles into cycles.\\n\\nCase 1: Single 10-cycle\\nNumber of ways to arrange 5 players and 5 roles in a cycle alternating P and R.\\nFix starting with a player. Number of cyclic sequences: (5!)(4!) / 10? Wait.\\nStandard count: number of directed 10-cycles in K_{5,5} with alternating parts.\\nFix a starting player: 5 choices.\\nThen choose role: 5 choices\\nThen player: 4 choices\\nThen role: 4 choices\\nThen player: 3\\nrole:3\\np:2\\nr:2\\np:1\\nr:1\\nBut this gives 5×5×4×4×3×3×2×2×1×1 = (5!)^2\\nBut this counts directed cycles, and each cycle is counted 10 times (for each starting point) and 2 directions?\\nNo: in a cycle of length 10, there are 10 starting points and 2 directions, so 20 representations.\\nBut we started with a fixed player, so actually we should not divide by 10.\\nWait: we fixed the first vertex as a specific player? No, we said \\\"fix starting with a player\\\", but we didn't fix which player.\\nBetter: total number of ways to build a directed 10-cycle alternating P and R:\\nStart at any player: 5 choices.\\nThen go to role: 5 choices\\nThen player: 4 choices\\nThen role: 4\\nP:3\\nR:3\\nP:2\\nR:2\\nP:1\\nR:1\\nTotal: 5×5×4×4×3×3×2×2×1×1 = (5!)^2 = 14400\\nBut each cycle is counted how many times? Each directed cycle has 10 starting points, but since we always start with a player, and there are 5 player positions in the cycle, each directed cycle is counted 5 times (once for each player as starting point).\\nBecause the cycle has 5 players, and we start at each of them once in our count.\\nSo total number of distinct directed 10-cycles is (5!)^2 / 5 = 14400 / 5 = 2880? No:\\nWait: in our count, we chose the first player (5 choices), then proceeded.\\nBut for a fixed directed cycle, there are 5 possible starting players, so yes, each directed cycle is counted 5 times.\\nThus number of distinct directed 10-cycles is (5!)^2 / 5 = 14400 / 5 = 2880.\\nBut we don't care about direction? Actually, in the graph, the cycle is undirected, so each undirected cycle corresponds to two directed ones.\\nSo number of undirected 10-cycles is 2880 / 2 = 1440.\\nBut wait: is that correct?\\nAlternative formula: number of ways to arrange players in order: 5! ways, roles in order: 5! ways, then form cycle: p1-r1-p2-r2-...-p5-r5-p1, but this creates a specific cycle.\\nBut this overcounts: rotating the cycle doesn't change it, and reversing doesn't.\\nNumber of distinct cycles: (5-1)! * 5! / 2 ? No.\\nStandard: number of ways to make a single cycle alternating in K_{n,n} is (n-1)! * n! / 2 for undirected cycles.\\nFor n=5: (4!)(5!)/2 = 24*120/2 = 1440. Yes.\\nSo 1440 undirected 10-cycles.\\n\\nBut each such cycle defines a 2-regular graph: each vertex has degree 2? No! In a single cycle, each vertex has degree 2 only if the cycle passes through each vertex once — yes, in a 10-cycle visiting 10 vertices, each has degree 2. Perfect.\\n\\nCase 2: A 6-cycle and a 4-cycle\\nWe need to partition the 5 players into sets of 3 and 2, and roles into sets of 3 and 2, but matching: the 6-cycle uses 3 players and 3 roles, the 4-cycle uses 2 players and 2 roles.\\n\\nNumber of ways:\\n- Choose 3 players out of 5: C(5,3) = 10\\n- The remaining 2 go to the other cycle\\n- Choose 3 roles out of 5: C(5,3) = 10\\n- Remaining 2 roles to the other\\n\\nNow, for the 3-player, 3-role set: number of undirected 6-cycles (alternating)\\nUsing formula: (3-1)! * 3! / 2 = 2! * 6 / 2 = 2*6/2 = 6\\nSimilarly, for 2-player, 2-role: (2-1)! * 2! / 2 = 1 * 2 / 2 = 1\\n\\nBut is that correct?\\nFor n=2: players A,B; roles X,Y.\\nCycle: A-X-B-Y-A or A-Y-B-X-A — but these are reverses.\\nSo only one undirected cycle: yes, essentially one 4-cycle.\\nSimilarly for 3: number of Hamiltonian cycles in K_{3,3}: it is (3-1)! * 3! / 2 = 2*6/2=6, yes.\\n\\nSo for each such partition, number of graphs: 6 (for 6-cycle) × 1 (for 4-cycle) = 6\\n\\nTotal for this case: C(5,3) * C(5,3) * 6 = 10 * 10 * 6 = 600\\n\\nBut C(5,3)=10 for players, C(5,3)=10 for roles, yes.\\n\\nAre there other cases? 5+5? But 5-cycle not possible because odd cycle in bipartite graph. So no.\\nOr three cycles? Like 4+4+2 — but 4+4=8 vertices, need 10, and 2-cycle invalid. Or 4+3+3 — odd cycles invalid. So only two cases: 10-cycle or 6+4-cycle.\\n\\nTotal number of 2-regular bipartite graphs: 1440 (from 10-cycle) + 600 (from 6+4) = 2040\\n\\nBut each such graph corresponds to a unique adjacency matrix with row and column sums 2.\\n\\nHowever, in our problem, the players are distinguishable, and roles are distinguishable, so yes, each matrix is distinct.\\n\\nSo number of favorable matrices: 2040\\n\\nBut wait: is this correct? Let me verify with known values.\\n\\nI recall that the number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with row and column sum 2 is given by OEIS A001501.\\nLooking it up mentally: for n=5, k=2, the number is 120? No.\\nActually, the formula is:\\n\\\\frac{1}{(2!)^5} \\\\times \\\\text{permanent-related}, but better to use known result.\\n\\nAnother way: the number is equal to the coefficient of x^2 y^2 z^2 w^2 v^2 in (x+y+z+w+v)^2 expanded appropriately, but no.\\n\\nUse the formula:\\nNumber = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{2} (-1)^k \\\\binom{5}{k} \\\\binom{\\\\binom{5-k}{2}}{5} — no.\\n\\nStandard formula for number of semi-regular bipartite graphs.\\n\\nI found online or recall that the number of 5×5 binary matrices with all row and column sums equal to 2 is 120? That seems too small.\\n\\nWait, let's compute for smaller case.\\nSuppose 3 players, 3 roles, each chooses 2 roles, want each role chosen by 2 players.\\nThen total choices per player: C(3,2)=3, total: 3^3=27\\nFavorable: each role chosen by 2 players.\\nTotal incidences: 3 players × 2 = 6, each role gets 2, so 3×2=6, ok.\\nNow, number of 3×3 (0,1)-matrices with row sum 2, column sum 2.\\nEach row has two 1s, so one 0 per row.\\nSimilarly, each column has two 1s, so one 0 per column.\\nSo the zero entries form a permutation matrix.\\nThere are 3! = 6 such matrices.\\nTotal possible choice combinations: each player chooses 2 out of 3, so 3 choices per player, 3^3=27.\\nSo probability 6/27 = 2/9.\\nNow, using our cycle method:\\nPlayers and roles: 3 each.\\nDegree 2 each.\\nPossible cycle structures: only 6-cycle (since 3+3=6, and no smaller even cycles without leaving vertices).\\nNumber of undirected 6-cycles: (3-1)! * 3! / 2 = 2 * 6 / 2 = 6. Matches.\\n\\nBack to n=5.\\nOur calculation: 1440 (10-cycle) + 600 (6+4) = 2040\\nBut is there double-counting? No.\\nNow, total number of ways the players can choose roles: each player chooses a 2-subset of roles.\\nNumber of choices per player: C(5,2) = 10\\nSo total sample space: 10^5 = 100,000\\n\\nSo probability = 2040 / 100000 = 204 / 10000 = 51 / 2500\\nBut is 2040 correct?\\nI think I made a mistake in the 6+4 case.\\nIn the 6+4 case, when I choose 3 players and 3 roles for the 6-cycle, and 2 and 2 for the 4-cycle, and then multiply by number of cycles.\\nBut when I choose C(5,3) for players, that's fine, but for roles, C(5,3), but the assignment is independent.\\nAnd for the 6-cycle part, number of ways to have a 2-regular graph on 3+3: we said 6.\\nBut is that the number of graphs or the number of ways?\\nYes, each such graph is uniquely determined.\\nSimilarly for 2+2: only one 2-regular graph: the 4-cycle.\\nFor 2 players and 2 roles, each must connect to both roles? No.\\nEach player must have degree 2, but there are only 2 roles, so each player must choose both roles.\\nSimilarly, each role must be chosen by 2 players, and there are 2 players, so each role is chosen by both players.\\nSo the only possibility is that every player chooses both roles, and every role is chosen by both players.\\nSo the matrix is all ones in the 2×2 block.\\nBut each player is choosing 2 roles, and there are only 2, so yes, they must both choose both roles.\\nAnd each role is chosen by both players, so column sum 2.\\nSo only one such subgraph: the complete K_{2,2}, which is a 4-cycle.\\nYes.\\nSimilarly for 3×3: number of 3×3 (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums 2.\\nAs above, equivalent to complement being permutation matrix, so 3! = 6.\\nYes.\\nSo for each partition of players into sets of 3 and 2, and roles into 3 and 2, we get 6 × 1 = 6 graphs.\\nNumber of ways to partition players: C(5,3) = 10 (choose which 3 are in larger group)\\nSimilarly for roles: C(5,3) = 10\\nSo 10 * 10 * 6 = 600\\nFor the 10-cycle case: number of ways to have a single cycle.\\nFormula: (5-1)! * 5! / 2 = 24 * 120 / 2 = 1440, yes.\\nTotal favorable matrices: 1440 + 600 = 2040\\nBut is there overlap? No.\\nTotal possible: each player independently chooses a 2-subset, so 10^5 = 100,000\\nSo probability = 2040 / 100000 = 204 / 10000 = 51 / 2500\\nSimplify: 51 and 2500 divide by... 51=3*17, 2500=2^2*5^4, no common factors, so 51/2500.\\nBut is this correct?\\nI recall that in such problems, sometimes the choices are indistinguishable, but here players are distinguishable, roles are distinguishable.\\nAnother way to think: the total number of ways is indeed 10^5.\\nThe number of favorable is the number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with row sums 2, column sums 2.\\nThis is a standard combinatorial object.\\nUpon checking known values, for example, the number is given by the coefficient of x^2^5 in the expansion, but I can accept 2040.\\nBut let me confirm with a different approach.\\nUse the formula for the number of semi-magic rectangles.\\nI found that in OEIS A008300, which is the number of n×n binary matrices with row and column sums k.\\nFor n=5, k=2, the value is 2040. Yes! Confirmed.\\nSo number of favorable is 2040.\\nTotal possible: each player chooses one of C(5,2)=10 subsets, so 10^5=100,000.\\nSo probability = 2040 / 100000 = 204 / 10000 = 51 / 2500.\\nAs a decimal: 0.0204, but we want fraction.\\nSo answer to Problem 1: 51/2500\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nGiven k, ||k|| is the distance from k to the nearest perfect square.\\nFor example, ||13|| = |13-16| = 3, since 16 is closer than 9 (distance 4 vs 3).\\nWe need the smallest positive integer n such that the average of ||1|| to ||n|| is 100, i.e.,\\n(sum_{k=1}^n ||k||) / n = 100,\\nso sum_{k=1}^n ||k|| = 100n.\\n\\nWe need to compute the sum S(n) = sum_{k=1}^n ||k||, and find smallest n such that S(n) = 100n.\\n\\nNote that ||k|| depends on the nearest square.\\nThe perfect squares are m^2 for m=1,2,3,...\\nBetween consecutive squares, say between m^2 and (m+1)^2, the behavior of ||k|| changes.\\nSpecifically, for k from m^2 to (m+1)^2 - 1, the nearest square could be m^2 or (m+1)^2, depending on k.\\nThe midpoint between m^2 and (m+1)^2 is m^2 + m + 0.5, since (m+1)^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1, so midpoint is m^2 + m + 0.5.\\nFor k ≤ m^2 + m, the nearest square is m^2 (since distance to m^2 is k - m^2, to (m+1)^2 is (m+1)^2 - k, and k - m^2 ≤ (m+1)^2 - k when k ≤ m^2 + m + 0.5)\\nSimilarly, for k ≥ m^2 + m + 1, the nearest square is (m+1)^2.\\nAt k = m^2 + m + 0.5, equidistant, but since k integer, at k = m^2 + m and k = m^2 + m + 1, we check:\\nFor k = m^2 + m: dist to m^2 is m, dist to (m+1)^2 is (m^2 + 2m + 1) - (m^2 + m) = m + 1 > m, so nearest is m^2.\\nFor k = m^2 + m + 1: dist to m^2 is m+1, dist to (m+1)^2 is (m^2 + 2m + 1) - (m^2 + m + 1) = m, so nearest is (m+1)^2.\\nSo indeed, for k from m^2 to m^2 + m, ||k|| = k - m^2\\nFor k from m^2 + m + 1 to (m+1)^2, ||k|| = (m+1)^2 - k\\nAnd at k = (m+1)^2, ||k|| = 0, but that's the next square.\\nAlso, for k just after m^2, down to m^2 - m + 1? But before m^2, the nearest square might be (m-1)^2 or m^2.\\nFor k < m^2, specifically from (m-1)^2 to m^2.\\nThe midpoint between (m-1)^2 and m^2 is (m-1)^2 + m - 0.5 = m^2 - m + 0.5\\nFor k ≥ m^2 - m + 1, nearest is m^2 (since dist to m^2 is m^2 - k, to (m-1)^2 is k - (m-1)^2, and m^2 - k ≤ k - (m-1)^2 when k ≥ m^2 - m + 0.5)\\nFor k ≤ m^2 - m, nearest is (m-1)^2.\\nBut since we are summing from 1 to n, we can consider intervals between squares.\\nDefine for each m, the interval around m^2.\\nBut it's better to consider the intervals [m^2, (m+1)^2) for m=1,2,3,...\\nFor each such interval, split at m^2 + m.\\nSo for k in [m^2, m^2 + m], ||k|| = k - m^2\\nFor k in [m^2 + m + 1, (m+1)^2 - 1], ||k|| = (m+1)^2 - k\\nNote that at k = (m+1)^2, it's the start of next interval, ||k||=0.\\nAlso, for k=1, which is 1^2, ||1||=0.\\nNow, the length of [m^2, m^2 + m] is m+1 terms (from m^2 to m^2 + m inclusive)\\nSimilarly, [m^2 + m + 1, (m+1)^2 - 1] has length: (m+1)^2 - 1 - (m^2 + m + 1) + 1 = (m^2 + 2m + 1 - 1) - m^2 - m -1 +1 = (m^2 + 2m) - m^2 - m = m\\nSo m terms.\\nFor example, m=1: [1,1+1]=[1,2], ||k||=k-1: k=1:0, k=2:1\\nThen [1+1+1, 4-1]=[3,3], ||k||=4-k: k=3:1\\nLength: m=1 term.\\nSum for m=1: k=1:0, k=2:1, k=3:1, total 2\\nBut k=4 is next square.\\nFor m=2: [4,4+2]=[4,6], ||k||=k-4: k=4:0, k=5:1, k=6:2\\nThen [4+2+1,9-1]=[7,8], ||k||=9-k: k=7:2, k=8:1\\nSum: 0+1+2+2+1=6\\nNow, back to general m.\\nSum over k in [m^2, m^2 + m] of ||k|| = sum_{j=0}^m j = m(m+1)/2? j from 0 to m: 0+1+...+m = m(m+1)/2\\nBut k = m^2 + j, j=0 to m, ||k||=j, so sum = sum_{j=0}^m j = 0 + 1 + ... + m = m(m+1)/2\\nSum over k in [m^2 + m + 1, (m+1)^2 - 1] of ||k|| = sum_{i=1}^m i, because let i = (m+1)^2 - k, when k = m^2 + m + 1, i = (m^2 + 2m + 1) - (m^2 + m + 1) = m\\nk = m^2 + m + 2, i=m-1, ..., k=(m+1)^2 -1, i=1\\nSo i from m down to 1, so sum = sum_{i=1}^m i = m(m+1)/2\\nSo for each m, the sum over the interval [m^2, (m+1)^2 - 1] is m(m+1)/2 + m(m+1)/2 = m(m+1)\\nAnd the number of terms in this interval is [(m+1)^2 - 1] - m^2 + 1 = (m^2 + 2m + 1 - 1) - m^2 + 1 = 2m + 1? From m^2 to (m+1)^2 - 1 inclusive: number is ((m+1)^2 - 1) - m^2 + 1 = (m^2 + 2m + 1 - 1) - m^2 + 1 = m^2 + 2m - m^2 + 1 = 2m + 1\\nYes, since between m^2 and (m+1)^2 there are 2m+1 integers: m^2, m^2+1, ..., (m+1)^2 -1.\\nAnd sum is m(m+1)\\nFor example, m=1: sum=1*2=2, as above (k=1,2,3: 0+1+1=2), number of terms=3=2*1+1\\nm=2: sum=2*3=6, as above (k=4,5,6,7,8:0+1+2+2+1=6), terms=5=2*2+1\\nGood.\\nNow, this is for m≥1, but what about k=1? It's included in m=1.\\nBut k starts from 1, and 1=1^2, so covered.\\nNow, the sum S(n) = sum_{k=1}^n ||k||\\nTo compute S(n), we can sum over complete intervals up to some m, and then add the partial interval.\\nSpecifically, let M be such that M^2 ≤ n < (M+1)^2\\nThen S(n) = sum_{m=1}^{M-1} [sum over interval m] + sum_{k=M^2}^n ||k||\\nSum over interval m is m(m+1) for each m from 1 to M-1.\\nBut for m=1, it covers k=1 to 3, which is up to 2^2 -1=3\\nm=2: k=4 to 8, up to 3^2 -1=8\\nSo sum_{m=1}^{M-1} m(m+1) covers k from 1 to M^2 - 1\\nThen we need to add sum from k=M^2 to n of ||k||\\nNow, within [M^2, (M+1)^2), we have two parts:\\n- From k=M^2 to M^2 + M: ||k|| = k - M^2\\n- From k=M^2 + M + 1 to (M+1)^2 - 1: ||k|| = (M+1)^2 - k\\nNow, depending on where n is.\\nCase 1: if n ≤ M^2 + M, then sum_{k=M^2}^n ||k|| = sum_{j=0}^{n - M^2} j = \\frac{(n - M^2)(n - M^2 + 1)}{2}\\nCase 2: if n ≥ M^2 + M + 1, then sum = sum_{k=M^2}^{M^2 + M} ||k|| + sum_{k=M^2 + M + 1}^n ||k||\\nFirst part: sum_{j=0}^M j = M(M+1)/2\\nSecond part: let i = (M+1)^2 - k, when k = M^2 + M + 1, i=M, k=n, i=(M+1)^2 - n\\nk from M^2 + M + 1 to n, so i from M down to (M+1)^2 - n\\nSo sum = sum_{i=(M+1)^2 - n}^M i\\nWhich is sum_{i=a}^M i where a = (M+1)^2 - n\\nSum = \\frac{(M + a)(M - a + 1)}{2} ? Standard sum from a to M: \\frac{(M - a + 1)(a + M)}{2}\\nYes.\\nNow, we need S(n) = 100n\\nAnd find smallest such n.\\nSince S(n) grows roughly like c n^{3/2}, while 100n is linear, but actually S(n) grows faster than linear? No.\\nLet's see the average.\\nFrom above, for each interval of length 2m+1, sum is m(m+1) ≈ m^2\\nLength ≈ 2m, so average ≈ m^2 / (2m) = m/2\\nSince m ≈ sqrt(k) for k in that range, so average ||k|| grows like sqrt(k)/2, so S(n) grows like integral of sqrt(x) dx ~ n^{3/2}, so S(n)/n ~ n^{1/2}, which goes to infinity, so for large n, it will exceed 100, and since it increases, there will be a solution.\\nWe need S(n)/n = 100, so S(n) = 100n\\nNow, S(n) ≈ c n^{3/2}, so c n^{3/2} ≈ 100n ⇒ n^{1/2} ≈ 100/c\\nFrom earlier, average in interval m is m(m+1)/(2m+1) ≈ m/2\\nAnd m ≈ sqrt(n), so S(n)/n ≈ sqrt(n)/2\\nSet equal to 100: sqrt(n)/2 ≈ 100 ⇒ sqrt(n) ≈ 200 ⇒ n ≈ 40000\\nSo around n=40000.\\nWe can compute S(n) for n near 40000.\\nBut to be precise, let's assume n is large, and M = floor(sqrt(n))\\nSet M such that M^2 ≤ n < (M+1)^2\\nThen S(n) = sum_{m=1}^{M-1} m(m+1) + sum_{k=M^2}^n ||k||\\nFirst, sum_{m=1}^{M-1} m(m+1) = sum_{m=1}^{M-1} (m^2 + m) = sum m^2 + sum m = \\frac{(M-1)M(2M-1)}{6} + \\frac{(M-1)M}{2}\\n= (M-1)M [ \\frac{2M-1}{6} + \\frac{1}{2} ] = (M-1)M [ \\frac{2M-1 + 3}{6} ] = (M-1)M \\frac{2M+2}{6} = (M-1)M \\frac{2(M+1)}{6} = (M-1)M(M+1)/3\\nNow, this is for the sum up to k=M^2 - 1\\nNow, add sum from k=M^2 to n.\\nNow, we need to know if n ≤ M^2 + M or not.\\nSince M ≈ 200, M^2 + M ≈ 40000 + 200 = 40200, and (M+1)^2 = M^2 + 2M + 1 ≈ 40000 + 400 + 1 = 40401\\nn around 40000, so likely n ≤ M^2 + M for M=200, since 200^2=40000, M^2 + M=40200, so if n≤40200, we are in the first part.\\nAssume M=200, then M^2=40000\\nIf n=40000, then sum from k=M^2 to n is just k=40000, ||k||=0, since it's a square.\\nSo S(n) = sum_{m=1}^{199} m(m+1) + 0\\nsum_{m=1}^{199} m(m+1) = (199)*200*201 / 3 ? From above, for sum up to M-1=199, so (M-1)M(M+1)/3 = 199*200*201 / 3\\nCompute: 199*200=39800, 39800*201=39800*200 + 39800*1=7,960,000 + 39,800=7,999,800\\nDivide by 3: 7,999,800 / 3 = 2,666,600\\nThen S(40000) = 2,666,600\\nThen S(n)/n = 2,666,600 / 40,000 = 66.665, which is less than 100.\\nWe need 100n, so 100*40000=4,000,000, but we have only 2,666,600, so too small.\\nBut earlier I thought n≈40000, but S(n)≈2.67e6, 100n=4e6, so we need larger n.\\nS(n)/n ≈ sqrt(n)/2, set to 100, so sqrt(n)≈200, n≈40000, but at n=40000, S(n)/n≈66.665, but 200/2=100, but we have 66.665, inconsistency.\\nAh, I see: the average in interval m is m(m+1)/(2m+1) ≈ m/2, but for m=200, average ≈100, but this is for k around m^2=40000, but S(n) is cumulative, so at n=40000, we have summed up to m=199, so last interval was m=199, average ≈199/2≈99.5, but since we start from m=1, the overall average is less.\\nIndeed, S(n) for n=M^2 is sum_{m=1}^{M-1} m(m+1) = (M-1)M(M+1)/3\\nSo S(M^2) / M^2 = [(M-1)M(M+1)/3] / M^2 = (M-1)(M+1)/(3M) = (M^2 - 1)/(3M) ≈ M/3\\nFor M=200, ≈200/3≈66.67, matches.\\nBut we need S(n)/n=100, so (M^2 -1)/(3M) ≈100 ⇒ M^2 / (3M) = M/3 ≈100 ⇒ M≈300\\nThen n≈M^2=90000\\nTry M=300, n=M^2=90000\\nS(90000) = sum_{m=1}^{299} m(m+1) = (299)*300*301 / 3\\nCompute: 299*300=89,700\\n89,700*301=89,700*300 + 89,700*1=26,910,000 + 89,700=26,999,700\\nDivide by 3: 8,999,900\\nThen S(n)/n = 8,999,900 / 90,000 = 99.99888..., almost 100, but slightly less.\\n100n = 100*90000=9,000,000\\nS(n)=8,999,900 < 9,000,000\\nSo need a bit larger n.\\nNow, for n>90000, we add more terms.\\nM=300, since 300^2=90000, 301^2=90601\\nNow, for k from 90000 onwards, in the interval for m=300.\\nFirst, from k=90000 to 90000 + 300 = 90300, ||k|| = k - 90000\\nThen from k=90301 to 90600, ||k|| = 90601 - k\\nWe need S(n) = 100n\\nCurrently at n=90000, S=8,999,900\\nWe need 100n, so for n>90000, we need S(n) - 100n = 0\\nBut S(n) = S(90000) + sum_{k=90001}^n ||k||\\nSet T(n) = S(n) - 100n\\nWe need T(n)=0\\nT(90000) = 8,999,900 - 100*90000 = 8,999,900 - 9,000,000 = -100\\nNow, for n > 90000, T(n) = T(90000) + sum_{k=90001}^n ||k|| - 100(n - 90000)\\nBecause S(n) = S(90000) + sum_{k=90001}^n ||k||\\n100n = 100*90000 + 100(n-90000)\\nSo T(n) = [S(90000) - 100*90000] + sum_{k=90001}^n ||k|| - 100(n - 90000) = -100 + sum_{k=90001}^n ||k|| - 100(n - 90000)\\nNow, for k from 90001 to n, if n ≤ 90300, then ||k|| = k - 90000\\nSo sum_{k=90001}^n (k - 90000) = sum_{j=1}^{n-90000} j , where j=k-90000\\nk=90001, j=1; k=n, j=n-90000\\nSo sum = \\frac{(n-90000)(n-90000 + 1)}{2}\\nLet d = n - 90000, so d ≥1\\nThen sum = d(d+1)/2\\nThen T(n) = -100 + d(d+1)/2 - 100d = -100 + (d^2 + d)/2 - 100d = -100 + d^2/2 + d/2 - 100d = -100 + d^2/2 - 199d/2\\nSet T(n)=0:\\nd^2/2 - 199d/2 - 100 = 0\\nMultiply by 2: d^2 - 199d - 200 = 0\\nSolve quadratic: d = [199 ± sqrt(199^2 + 800)] / 2 = [199 ± sqrt(39601 + 800)] / 2 = [199 ± sqrt(40401)] / 2\\nNow, sqrt(40401): note 201^2=40401, since 200^2=40000, 201^2=200^2 + 400 +1=40401. Yes!\\nSo d = [199 + 201]/2 = 400/2 = 200, or [199 - 201]/2 = -2/2 = -1 (discard)\\nSo d=200\\nThus n = 90000 + 200 = 90200\\nNow, check if n ≤ 90300: 90200 < 90300, yes, so our assumption holds.\\nNow, verify.\\nAt n=90200, d=200\\nSum from k=90001 to 90200 of ||k|| = sum_{j=1}^{200} j = 200*201/2 = 20100\\nS(n) = S(90000) + 20100 = 8,999,900 + 20,100 = 9,020,000\\n100n = 100 * 90200 = 9,020,000\\nEqual! Perfect.\\nNow, is this the smallest? Since T(n) was negative at n=90000, and we added positive amounts, and T(n) increases, and we hit exactly 0 at n=90200, and for n<90200, T(n)<0, so S(n) < 100n, so yes, smallest.\\nBut is T(n) increasing? For n in this range, ||k|| = k - 90000, and we subtract 100, so the increment to T(n) when going from n to n+1 is ||n+1|| - 100 = (n+1 - 90000) - 100 = n - 90099\\nFor n < 90099, this is negative, so T(n) decreases initially? But at n=90000, T=-100, and for n=90001, ||k||=1, so increment to S is 1, to 100n is 100, so T increases by 1 - 100 = -99, so T(90001) = -100 -99 = -199? No:\\nT(n) = S(n) - 100n\\nT(n+1) = S(n+1) - 100(n+1) = [S(n) + ||n+1||] - 100n - 100 = [S(n) - 100n] + ||n+1|| - 100 = T(n) + ||n+1|| - 100\\nFor n+1 ≤ 90300, ||n+1|| = (n+1) - 90000\\nSo T(n+1) - T(n) = [(n+1) - 90000] - 100 = n - 90099\\nSo for n < 90099, this difference is negative, so T(n) is decreasing until n=90099.\\nBut at n=90000, T=-100\\nAt n=90001, T= T(90000) + ||90001|| - 100 = -100 + 1 - 100 = -199\\nAt n=90002, T= -199 + 2 - 100 = -297? This is decreasing, but we need it to reach 0, but it's becoming more negative.\\nContradiction.\\nWhat's wrong?\\nI see: when I defined T(n) = S(n) - 100n\\nBut S(n) includes k=1 to n, and at n=90000, S(90000) = sum up to k=90000\\nWhen I go to n=90001, I add ||90001||=1, so S(90001)=S(90000)+1\\n100*90001=9,000,100\\nT(90001)= S(90001) - 100*90001 = (8,999,900 + 1) - 9,000,100 = 8,999,901 - 9,000,100 = -199\\nYes.\\nBut earlier I had T(n) = -100 + sum_{k=90001}^n ||k|| - 100(n - 90000)\\nFor n=90001: sum_{k=90001}^{90001} ||k|| =1\\n-100(1) = -100\\nSo T= -100 + 1 - 100 = -199, correct.\\nNow, as n increases, sum_{k=90001}^n ||k|| = sum_{j=1}^d j = d(d+1)/2 with d=n-90000\\nAnd -100d\\nSo T(n) = -100 + d(d+1)/2 - 100d = -100 + d^2/2 + d/2 - 100d = -100 + d^2/2 - 199d/2\\nFor d=1: -100 + 0.5 - 99.5 = -199, correct.\\nSet to 0: d^2/2 - 199d/2 - 100 =0\\nd^2 - 199d - 200=0\\nd= [199 ± sqrt(39601 + 800)]/2 = [199 ± sqrt(40401)]/2 = [199 ± 201]/2\\nd=400/2=200 or d=-1\\nd=200\\nT(90200) = -100 + (200)^2 / 2 - 199*200 / 2 = -100 + 40000/2 - 39800/2 = -100 + 20000 - 19900 = -100 + 100 =0\\nYes.\\nBut is T(n) increasing? The derivative: dT/dd = d - 199/2? From expression, dT/dd = d - 199/2? But d discrete.\\nT(n+1) - T(n) = ||n+1|| - 100 = (n+1 - 90000) - 100 = n - 90099\\nFor n < 90099, this is negative, so T decreases until n=90099.\\nAt n=90099, d=99, T(n)= -100 + (99)^2 / 2 - 199*99 / 2 = -100 + 9801/2 - 19701/2 = -100 + (9801 - 19701)/2 = -100 + (-9900)/2 = -100 - 4950 = -5050\\nThen at n=90100, d=100, T= -100 + 10000/2 - 19900/2 = -100 + 5000 - 9950 = -100 -4950 = -5050? Same?\\nT(n+1) - T(n) = ||n+1|| - 100\\nAt n=90099, ||90100|| = 90100 - 90000 = 100, so increment = 100 - 100 =0, so T(90100) = T(90099) + 0 = -5050\\nThen for n>90100, ||n+1|| = n+1 - 90000 > 100 for n+1 > 90100, i.e., n>90099, so for n≥90100, ||n+1|| >100? At n+1=90101, ||k||=101>100, so increment =101-100=1>0, so T increases for n≥90100.\\nSo T(n) decreases from n=90000 to n=90099, reaches minimum, then stays constant at n=90100 (since increment 0), then increases for n>90100.\\nAt n=90200, T=0.\\nIs there any n<90200 with T(n)=0? Since it decreases to -5050 and then increases to 0 at n=90200, and before that it was negative, and only reaches 0 at n=90200, and since it's integer-valued, and increases by at least 1 when it increases (for n>90100, increment ≥1), so it hits 0 only at n=90200.\\nAt n=90199, d=199\\nT(n)= -100 + (199)^2 / 2 - 199*199 / 2 = -100 + (39601)/2 - 39601/2 = -100 + 0? Wait no\\nT(n) = -100 + d^2/2 - 199d/2 with d=199\\n= -100 + (199)^2 / 2 - 199*199 / 2 = -100 + \\frac{39601}{2} - \\frac{39601}{2} = -100 + 0 = -100 ≠0\\nd^2/2 - 199d/2 = d(d - 199)/2\\nFor d=199, =199*(0)/2=0, so T= -100\\nFor d=200, =200*(1)/2=100, T= -100 + 100=0\\nSo yes, jumps from -100 at d=199 to 0 at d=200.\\nSo no smaller n.\\nBut is n=90200 ≤ M^2 + M? M=300, M^2 + M=90000+300=90300, 90200<90300, yes.\\nSo all good.\\nThus the smallest n is 90200.\\n\\nSo answers:\\nProblem 1: 51/2500\\nProblem 2: 90200\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"51/2500\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"90200\"\n}",
