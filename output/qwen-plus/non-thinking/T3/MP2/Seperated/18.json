On each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. The player who empties the pile wins. For example, if Trevor goes first with a pile of 5 beans, he can either add 4 to make the total 9, or remove 4 to make the total 1, and either way Edward wins by removing all the beans. There is no limit to how large the pile can grow; it just starts with some finite number of beans in it, say fewer than 1000. Before the game begins, Edward dispatches a spy to find out how many beans will be in the opening pile, call this $n$, then \"graciously\" offers to let Trevor go first. Knowing that the first player is more likely to win, but not knowing $n$, Trevor logically but unwisely accepts, and Edward goes on to win the game. Find a number $n$ less than 1000 that would prompt this scenario, assuming both players are perfect logicians. A correct answer is worth the nearest integer to $\\log _{2}(n-4)$ points."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\n\\nWe are given a game between Trevor and Edward where they take turns adding or removing the largest perfect square number of beans currently in the pile. The player who empties the pile wins. Trevor goes first, but Edward wins — and this happens despite Trevor having the advantage of going first. We are to find an initial number of beans n < 1000 such that with perfect play, the second player (Edward) wins. Then compute the nearest integer to log₂(n - 4).\\n\\nKey observations:\\n- On any turn, the player must either add or remove the largest perfect square ≤ current pile size.\\n- The move is deterministic based on the current pile size: the largest perfect square ≤ current count.\\n- So from any state k, there is exactly one move possible: either add or remove floor(sqrt(k))².\\n- But wait: the problem says \\\"must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap\\\" — note: \\\"that is in the heap\\\" might be ambiguous.\\n\\nWait: re-read: \\\"add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap\\\" — actually, it probably means: the largest perfect square ≤ current number of beans. So for example, if there are 5 beans, the largest perfect square ≤ 5 is 4, so you can either add 4 or remove 4.\\n\\nSo from state k, let s = floor(sqrt(k))². Then the player can go to k + s or k - s (provided k - s ≥ 0; but adding is always allowed).\\n\\nBut the example says: with 5 beans, Trevor can add 4 (→9) or remove 4 (→1). Edward then wins in both cases. So from 9, largest square ≤9 is 9, so Edward removes 9 →0 and wins. From 1, largest square ≤1 is 1, so Edward removes 1 →0 and wins. So yes, Edward wins.\\n\\nSo the game is: from any position k > 0, define s = largest perfect square ≤ k. Then the player can move to k + s or k - s (if k - s ≥ 0).\\n\\nThe player who moves to 0 wins.\\n\\nWe need to find positions where the first player loses (i.e., second player wins) under optimal play.\\n\\nWe define a position as losing if all moves from it lead to winning positions for the opponent, or more precisely:\\n- A position is winning if there exists at least one move to a losing position for the opponent.\\n- A position is losing if every move leads to a winning position for the opponent.\\n- Position 0 is terminal — but no move from 0, and the player who just moved to 0 wins, so 0 is not a position from which a player moves. So we consider k > 0.\\n\\nActually, the player who empties the pile (i.e., moves to 0) wins. So if a player can move to 0, they win.\\n\\nSo we can do backward dynamic programming from small k up.\\n\\nLet’s define:\\n- f(k): true if the current player can force a win from k beans.\\n\\nBase case: if k = 0, game over. But we don’t define f(0). For k ≥ 1:\\nLet s = floor(sqrt(k))²\\nThen the possible moves are:\\n- Remove s: if k - s == 0 → win immediately\\n- Remove s: if k - s > 0 → go to state k - s\\n- Add s: go to state k + s\\n\\nSo from k, the current player can move to:\\n- k - s (if k - s >= 0)\\n- k + s\\n\\nNote: k - s could be 0, which is a win.\\n\\nSo f(k) = true if at least one of the next states is losing for the opponent (i.e., f(next) = false).\\n\\nBut k + s could be very large. However, since we are only interested in n < 1000, and the game may grow, but perhaps we can cap our analysis.\\n\\nBut note: the problem says Edward wins when Trevor goes first, meaning that for the starting n, f(n) = false (first player loses).\\n\\nWe need to find such an n < 1000 where f(n) = false.\\n\\nBut the game tree might involve states larger than 1000. However, since we’re only asked for one such n, and likely small ones exist, we can try to simulate up to some reasonable bound.\\n\\nLet’s set a limit, say up to 5000, to be safe.\\n\\nFirst, list perfect squares up to, say, 5000: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961, 1024, ..., up to 70²=4900, 71²=5041>5000.\\n\\nFor each k from 1 upwards, we can compute f(k), but since moves can go to k+s which is larger, we need to process in increasing order? No — because k+s > k, so to compute f(k), we may need f(k+s), which is larger.\\n\\nThis is a problem: the state space is unbounded above.\\n\\nBut note: adding s makes the pile larger, and the next player will have a larger square to work with. It might be that some states eventually loop or stabilize.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the losing positions are rare, and we can search for them by simulation with memoization and a reasonable upper bound.\\n\\nLet me try to compute f(k) for small k manually to see if I can spot a pattern.\\n\\nStart with k=1:\\ns = 1\\nMoves: remove 1 → 0 (win), so current player wins.\\nSo f(1) = true\\n\\nk=2:\\ns = 1 (since 1²=1 ≤2, 2²=4>2)\\nMoves: to 2-1=1 or 2+1=3\\nf(1)=true (opponent wins), so if we move to 1, opponent wins\\nNeed f(3): \\n\\nk=3:\\ns=1\\nMoves to 3-1=2 or 3+1=4\\nf(2)=? not yet known\\nf(4)=?\\n\\nk=4:\\ns=4\\nMoves: remove 4 → 0 (win), so f(4)=true\\n\\nBack to k=3: moves to 2 or 4\\nf(2): moves to 1 or 3\\nf(1)=true, f(3)=unknown\\nThis is getting messy.\\n\\nLet’s use dynamic programming with a dictionary and recursion with memoization, setting a high limit.\\n\\nBut since this is text, I’ll try to simulate step by step.\\n\\nDefine f(k): whether current player can force a win from k.\\nf(k) = true if there exists a move to a state m such that f(m) = false.\\nIf all moves lead to f(m)=true, then f(k)=false.\\n\\nWe'll compute f(k) for k from 1 up to, say, 2000, but since k+s can be large, we need to go higher.\\n\\nBut note: when you add s, you go to k + s, and s ≈ sqrt(k), so it grows slowly.\\n\\nLet me write a plan:\\n- Let max_k = 3000 (arbitrary bound)\\n- Initialize f[0] = undefined, but any move to 0 is a win.\\n- For k from 1 to max_k:\\n   s = floor(sqrt(k))**2\\n   moves = []\\n   if k - s == 0: then moving to 0 is a win → f(k) = true\\n   else: candidate moves to k-s and k+s\\n   But k+s may be > max_k, so we cannot evaluate f(k+s) if out of range.\\n\\nProblem: if k+s > max_k, we don't know f(k+s). We might assume it's true (win for the opponent), but that could be wrong.\\n\\nAlternative idea: perhaps the game has periodic behavior or known losing positions.\\n\\nLooking back at the example: n=5, Trevor loses. Let's verify:\\nk=5: s = 4 (since 2²=4, 3²=9>5)\\nMoves: to 5-4=1 or 5+4=9\\nf(1): from 1, s=1, can remove to 0 → win, so f(1)=true\\nf(9): s=9, remove to 0 → win, so f(9)=true\\nSo both moves from 5 go to winning positions for the opponent → so f(5)=false → first player loses.\\nSo n=5 is a losing position.\\n\\nSo answer could be n=5.\\nBut let's check if there are others.\\nThe question says “find a number n less than 1000”, and 5<1000.\\nThen compute nearest integer to log₂(n-4) = log₂(1) = 0 → nearest integer is 0.\\n\\nBut is 5 the only one? Probably not, but it works.\\nBut let me check k=2:\\nk=2: s=1\\nmoves to 1 or 3\\nf(1)=true\\nk=3: s=1, moves to 2 or 4\\nf(4)=true (as s=4, remove to 0)\\nSo f(3): moves to 2 and 4\\nf(2): moves to 1 and 3\\nWe have a cycle.\\nSet up equations:\\nLet f(2) = ?\\nFrom 2: can go to 1 (f=true) or 3\\nf(3) depends on f(2) and f(4)=true\\nf(3) = true if at least one of f(2) or f(4) is false. But f(4)=true, so f(3)=true iff f(2)=false\\nSimilarly, f(2) = true if at least one of f(1)=true or f(3) is false → i.e., f(2)=true unless f(3)=false\\nBut f(3)=true iff f(2)=false\\nCase 1: suppose f(2)=false → then f(3)=true (since f(2)=false, so from 3 can move to 2 which is losing for opponent → so f(3)=true)\\nBut f(2)=false means both moves from 2 lead to winning positions for opponent. Moves to 1 (f=true) and 3 (f=true) → yes, both true, so f(2)=false is consistent.\\nNow f(3): moves to 2 (f=false) and 4 (f=true). Since one move (to 2) leads to losing position for opponent, so f(3)=true.\\nAnd f(2)=false because both neighbors are true.\\nSo f(2)=false, f(3)=true.\\nThus k=2 is losing.\\n\\nBut k=2: s=1, moves to 1 or 3.\\nf(1)=true, f(3)=true → both winning for opponent → so yes, f(2)=false.\\nSo n=2 is also losing.\\n\\nSimilarly, k=5: moves to 1 and 9, both f=true → f(5)=false.\\n\\nk=6: s=4 (since 2²=4, 3²=9>6)\\nmoves to 6-4=2 or 6+4=10\\nf(2)=false → so moving to 2 is good (opponent loses) → so f(6)=true\\n\\nk=7: s=4, moves to 3 or 11\\nf(3)=true, f(11)=?\\n\\nk=11: s=9 (3²=9), moves to 11-9=2 or 11+9=20\\nf(2)=false → so moving to 2 is winning move → f(11)=true\\nSo from 7: moves to 3 (f=true) and 11 (f=true) → both winning for opponent? Then f(7)=false?\\nBut is f(11)=true? Yes, because it can move to 2 (losing for next player).\\nSo f(7): moves to 3 and 11, both f=true → so f(7)=false\\n\\nk=8: s=4? 2²=4, 3²=9>8 → s=4\\nmoves to 4 or 12\\nf(4)=true (can remove 4 to 0)\\nf(12): s=9, moves to 12-9=3 or 12+9=21\\nf(3)=true, f(21)=?\\n\\nk=21: s=16 (4²=16), moves to 21-16=5 or 21+16=37\\nf(5)=false → so moving to 5 is good → f(21)=true\\nSo f(12): moves to 3 (f=true) and 21 (f=true) → both winning for opponent? Then f(12)=false?\\nBut wait: if both moves from 12 go to winning positions for the opponent, then f(12)=false.\\nBut is there a move to a losing position? f(3)=true, f(21)=true → yes, both true → so f(12)=false\\n\\nBack to k=8: moves to 4 (f=true) and 12 (f=false)\\nSince can move to 12, which is losing for opponent, so f(8)=true\\n\\nk=10: s=9, moves to 10-9=1 or 10+9=19\\nf(1)=true, f(19)=?\\n\\nk=19: s=16, moves to 19-16=3 or 19+16=35\\nf(3)=true, f(35)=?\\n\\nk=35: s=25 (5²=25), moves to 35-25=10 or 35+25=60\\nf(10)=? unknown, f(60)=?\\nThis is getting deep.\\n\\nBut we already have several losing positions: 2,5,7,12,...\\n\\nThe problem says “a correct answer” — so any such n is acceptable.\\nTake n=5.\\nThen log₂(n-4) = log₂(1) = 0 → nearest integer is 0.\\n\\nBut let me confirm n=5: as in example, Trevor moves to 1 or 9, Edward removes all and wins. Yes.\\n\\nIs there a constraint that Edward didn't know n? But he dispatched a spy, so he knew n, and still let Trevor go first, and won. So n must be a losing position for first player.\\nYes, n=5 is such.\\n\\nSo n=5 is valid.\\n\\nBut the scoring is nearest integer to log₂(n-4). For n=5, it's log₂(1)=0.\\n\\nBut perhaps there are larger n that give more points, but the problem just asks to find a number, not maximize points.\\nSo any such n is fine.\\n\\nBut let me see if n=2 works:\\nn=2: s=1, Trevor can remove 1 →1, or add 1→3\\nFrom 1: Edward removes 1→0 and wins.\\nFrom 3: s=1, Edward can remove 1→2 or add 1→4\\nIf Edward moves to 2: then Trevor is at 2, which we think is losing? Wait.\\nf(2)=false, meaning the player to move loses.\\nSo if Edward moves to 2, then Trevor is to move from 2, which is losing for Trevor → so Edward wins.\\nBut can Edward choose to move to 2?\\nFrom 3: moves to 2 or 4.\\nf(4)=true, meaning the player to move from 4 wins (by removing 4).\\nSo if Edward moves to 4, then Trevor can remove 4 and win.\\nBut Edward wants to win, so he should not move to 4.\\nHe can move to 2, which is losing for Trevor, so Edward wins.\\nSo yes, from 3, Edward can move to 2 and win.\\nTherefore, whatever Trevor does from 2, Edward wins.\\nSo n=2 is also losing for first player.\\n\\nSimilarly, n=7: s=4, moves to 3 or 11\\nf(3)=true → if move to 3, Edward wins\\nf(11)=true → Edward wins\\nSo yes.\\n\\nSo multiple answers.\\nI can pick n=5.\\nThen log₂(5-4)=log₂(1)=0 → nearest integer 0.\\n\\nBut the problem says “the nearest integer to log₂(n−4) points” — so for n=5, it's 0 points, but that's fine.\\n\\nPerhaps they expect a larger n to get more points, but the problem doesn't say to maximize.\\n\\nBut let me see if there is a known sequence.\\nLosing positions: k where f(k)=false.\\nWe have: 2,5,7,12?\\nEarlier k=12: moves to 3 and 21\\nf(3)=true, f(21)=true (since can move to 5, which is losing)\\nSo yes, f(12)=false\\n\\nk=13: s=9, moves to 4 or 22\\nf(4)=true, f(22)=?\\n\\nk=22: s=16, moves to 6 or 38\\nf(6): earlier, from 6 can move to 2 (f=false), so f(6)=true\\nf(38): s=36, moves to 2 or 74\\nf(2)=false → so f(38)=true\\nSo f(22): moves to 6 (f=true) and 38 (f=true) → both winning for opponent? Then f(22)=false?\\nNo: if both moves go to winning positions for the opponent, then current player loses, so f(22)=false\\n\\nBack to k=13: moves to 4 (f=true) and 22 (f=false)\\nSince can move to 22 (losing for opponent), so f(13)=true\\n\\nk=14: s=9, moves to 5 or 23\\nf(5)=false → so can move to losing position → f(14)=true\\n\\nk=15: s=9, moves to 6 or 24\\nf(6)=true, f(24)=?\\n\\nk=24: s=16, moves to 8 or 40\\nf(8): earlier, from 8 can move to 4 or 12; f(12)=false, so f(8)=true\\nf(40): s=36, moves to 4 or 76\\nf(4)=true, f(76)=?\\nThis is deep.\\n\\nBut we have losing positions: 2,5,7,12,22,...\\n\\nI could pick n=22.\\nThen log₂(22-4)=log₂(18)≈ log₂(16)=4, log₂(32)=5, 18=16*1.125, log₂(18)=ln(18)/ln(2)≈2.89/0.693≈4.17? Wait:\\n2^4=16, 2^5=32\\nlog₂(18)= log₂(2*9)=1+log₂(9)=1+2log₂(3)≈1+2*1.585=1+3.17=4.17\\nNearest integer: 4\\n\\nBut n=5 gives 0, which is less.\\nBut again, any n is acceptable.\\n\\nTo be safe, I'll use n=5, as per the example.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nCount the number of distinct ways to color the vertices of a tetrahedron with 3 colors (red, blue, green) such that no face has all three vertices the same color. Two colorings are the same if one can be rotated to the other.\\n\\nA tetrahedron has 4 vertices, 4 faces (each a triangle), and rotational symmetry group A4 (alternating group) of order 12? Actually, the rotation group of the tetrahedron is A4, which has 12 elements.\\n\\nTotal colorings without symmetry: 3^4 = 81.\\nBut with symmetry, we use Burnside's lemma.\\n\\nBurnside: number of distinct colorings = (1/|G|) * sum_{g in G} fix(g)\\nwhere fix(g) is the number of colorings fixed by rotation g.\\n\\nG is the rotation group of the tetrahedron, order 12.\\n\\nTypes of rotations:\\n1. Identity: 1 element. Fixes all colorings: 3^4 = 81.\\n\\n2. Rotations by 120° and 240° around an axis through a vertex and the centroid of the opposite face. There are 4 vertices, and for each, 2 non-identity rotations (120° and 240°), so 4*2=8 elements.\\nFor such a rotation, it cycles the three vertices of the face and fixes the apex vertex.\\nSo in cycle notation: one 1-cycle (the apex) and one 3-cycle (the base).\\nFor a coloring to be fixed, the three cycled vertices must be the same color, and the apex can be any color.\\nSo number of fixed colorings: 3 (for the cycle) * 3 (for the fixed vertex) = 9.\\nBecause the three in the 3-cycle must be equal, so 3 choices for their color, 3 for the fixed vertex.\\n\\n3. Rotations by 180° around an axis through the midpoints of two opposite edges. How many such axes?\\nIn a tetrahedron, edges come in pairs that are opposite (no common vertex). Number of such pairs: total edges = 6, so 3 pairs of opposite edges.\\nFor each pair, one 180° rotation (which swaps the two edges, and swaps the two vertices of each edge? Let's see.\\nActually, a 180° rotation about the axis through midpoints of two opposite edges will swap the two edges, and thus swap the two vertices of the first edge and swap the two vertices of the second edge.\\nSo it consists of two 2-cycles.\\nFor example, swap vertex A and B, and swap C and D.\\nSo cycle structure: two 2-cycles.\\nNumber of such rotations: 3 (one for each pair of opposite edges).\\nFor a coloring to be fixed, in each 2-cycle, the two vertices must have the same color.\\nSo the two in first pair same color, two in second pair same color.\\nSo number of fixed colorings: 3 choices for first pair, 3 for second pair → 9.\\n\\nSummary:\\n- Identity: 1 element, fix = 81\\n- Face-axis rotations (120°, 240°): 8 elements, each fix = 9\\n- Edge-axis 180° rotations: 3 elements, each fix = 9\\n\\nTotal sum of fix(g) = 1*81 + 8*9 + 3*9 = 81 + 72 + 27 = 180\\n|G| = 12\\nSo number of distinct colorings up to rotation: 180 / 12 = 15\\n\\nBut this is without any restriction. We have the restriction that no face has all three vertices the same color.\\n\\nSo we need to apply Burnside to only the colorings that satisfy the condition.\\n\\nThat is, for each group element g, compute the number of colorings fixed by g that also satisfy the no-monochromatic-face condition.\\n\\nSo redefine fix(g) as number of colorings fixed by g and such that no face is monochromatic.\\n\\nWe go through each type.\\n\\n1. Identity: g = identity.\\nfix(g) = number of colorings where no face is monochromatic.\\nTotal colorings: 3^4 = 81\\nSubtract those with at least one monochromatic face.\\nBut inclusion-exclusion.\\nThere are 4 faces.\\nLet A_i be the set where face i is monochromatic.\\nWe want |total| - |A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3 ∪ A4|\\nBy inclusion-exclusion:\\n|∪ A_i| = Σ|A_i| - Σ|A_i ∩ A_j| + Σ|A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k| - |A1∩A2∩A3∩A4|\\n\\n|A_i|: face i monochromatic. Face i has 3 vertices. They must be same color: 3 choices. The remaining one vertex: 3 choices. So 3*3=9.\\nThere are 4 faces, so Σ|A_i| = 4*9 = 36\\n\\n|A_i ∩ A_j|: two faces monochromatic.\\nCase 1: faces i and j share an edge (i.e., adjacent). In tetrahedron, any two faces share an edge? No, each pair of faces shares an edge? Total number of pairs: C(4,2)=6.\\nEach pair of faces shares exactly one edge (since each edge is shared by two faces).\\nWhen two faces share an edge, they share two vertices.\\nSay face ABC and face ABD share edge AB.\\nFor both to be monochromatic: ABC all same color, say color X; ABD all same color, say Y.\\nBut A,B,C: A,B,C same color X\\nA,B,D: A,B,D same color Y\\nSo A,B must be both X and Y, so X=Y.\\nThen C and D must also be X.\\nSo all four vertices same color.\\nThus, the coloring is constant.\\nSo |A_i ∩ A_j| = 3 (all red, all blue, all green) for adjacent faces.\\nHow many such pairs? All pairs of faces are adjacent? In tetrahedron, every pair of faces shares an edge? Yes, because it's complete graph almost. Each face is a triangle, and any two triangles share an edge? No.\\nVertices: A,B,C,D.\\nFaces: ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.\\nPair ABC and ABD: share AB\\nABC and ACD: share AC\\nABC and BCD: share BC\\nABD and ACD: share AD\\nABD and BCD: share BD\\nACD and BCD: share CD\\nSo yes, every pair of faces shares exactly one edge. So all 6 pairs are adjacent.\\nThus, for each pair, |A_i ∩ A_j| = 3 (the constant colorings)\\nSo Σ|A_i ∩ A_j| = 6 * 3 = 18\\n\\n|A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k|: three faces monochromatic.\\nSay ABC, ABD, ACD.\\nFrom ABC mono: A,B,C same color X\\nABD mono: A,B,D same color Y → so X=Y, and D=X\\nACD mono: A,C,D same color Z → X=Z\\nSo A,B,C,D all color X.\\nSimilarly for any three faces, forces all four same color.\\nSo |A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k| = 3 for each triple.\\nNumber of triples: C(4,3)=4\\nSo sum = 4*3=12\\n\\n|A1∩A2∩A3∩A4|: all four faces monochromatic → again, forces all vertices same color → 3\\n\\nSo |∪ A_i| = 36 - 18 + 12 - 3 = 27\\n36 - 18 = 18, +12=30, -3=27\\nTotal colorings: 81\\nSo number with no monochromatic face: 81 - 27 = 54\\n\\nBut is that right? Let me verify.\\nTotal colorings: 81\\nAll constant: 3 → all faces mono\\nColorings with exactly one vertex different: e.g., three red, one blue.\\nChoose the different vertex: 4 choices, choose its color: 2 (not red), but the majority color: choose color for majority: 3, choose which vertex is different: 4, choose its color: 2 → 3*4*2=24\\nIn such a coloring, the face that includes the three same-color vertices: if the three red are together, but in tetrahedron, any three vertices form a face.\\nIf three vertices same color, say A,B,C red, D blue, then face ABC is monochromatic red.\\nThe other faces: ABD: A,B red, D blue → not mono\\nACD: A,C red, D blue → not mono\\nBCD: B,C red, D blue → not mono\\nSo only one monochromatic face.\\nSimilarly, if two of one color, two of another.\\nCases: two red, two blue, no green.\\nNumber: choose which two vertices red: C(4,2)=6, the other two blue. But since colors specified, 3 choices for the two colors? Better: choose partition of vertices into two pairs.\\nNumber of ways: first, choose how to partition 4 vertices into two unlabeled pairs: number is 3 (since for A, pair with B,C,or D; but each partition counted once: AB-CD, AC-BD, AD-BC).\\nFor each partition, assign colors to the two pairs: 3 choices for first pair, 2 for second? But colors are distinct, so 3*2=6, but since pairs are indistinct in labeling? No, the pairs are fixed by the partition.\\nActually, we assign a color to each pair.\\nBut we have two pairs, assign colors: can be same or different.\\nBut in this case, we want two colors used, each on two vertices.\\nSo choose two colors out of three: C(3,2)=3\\nAssign them to the two pairs: 2 ways (which color to which pair)\\nNumber of partitions into two pairs: 3 (as above)\\nSo total: 3 (color pairs) * 2 (assign) * 3 (partitions) = 18? But each coloring is counted once.\\nFor example, vertices A,B red, C,D blue: this corresponds to partition AB-CD, colors red and blue assigned.\\nNumber: C(4,2)=6 ways to choose which two are red, the other two blue. Since colors are specific, yes, 3 choices for the color of the first pair? Standard: number of ways to color with two colors each used twice: C(4,2) = 6 ways to choose positions for first color, but since two colors, and we choose which color is which: better: choose color for first vertex, but symmetric.\\nTotal: choose two vertices for red: C(4,2)=6, the other two blue. Similarly for other pairs of colors.\\nSo for red and blue: 6 colorings\\nSimilarly for red and green: 6\\nBlue and green: 6\\nTotal 18 colorings with exactly two colors, each used twice.\\n\\nIn such a coloring, is there a monochromatic face?\\nTake A,B red, C,D blue.\\nFace ABC: A,B red, C blue → not mono\\nFace ABD: A,B red, D blue → not mono\\nFace ACD: A red, C,D blue → not mono\\nFace BCD: B red, C,D blue → not mono\\nSo no monochromatic face.\\n\\nNow, colorings with three colors.\\nEither 2,1,1 or 1,1,1,1 but four vertices.\\nPartitions: 2,1,1 or 3,1 or 4 or 2,2.\\nWe did 4:3, 3,1:24, 2,2:18, now 2,1,1: two of one color, one each of others.\\nNumber: choose the color that appears twice: 3 choices\\nChoose which two vertices have that color: C(4,2)=6\\nThen, the remaining two vertices: assign the two other colors: 2 ways (which color to which vertex)\\nSo total: 3*6*2=36\\n\\nIn such a coloring, is there a monochromatic face?\\nSuppose A,B same color, say red.\\nC blue, D green.\\nFace ABC: A,B red, C blue → not mono\\nFace ABD: A,B red, D green → not mono\\nFace ACD: A red, C blue, D green → all different → not mono\\nFace BCD: B red, C blue, D green → all different → not mono\\nSo no monochromatic face.\\n\\nBut earlier I thought three same would make a face mono, but here only two same.\\n\\nNow, the only colorings with monochromatic faces are:\\n- All four same: 3 → each has four monochromatic faces\\n- Three same, one different: 24 → each has exactly one monochromatic face (the face consisting of the three same-color vertices)\\n\\nTotal with at least one monochromatic face: 3 + 24 = 27, matches inclusion-exclusion.\\n\\nSo number with no monochromatic face: 81 - 27 = 54\\n\\nThis includes: the 2,2 split: 18, and the 2,1,1 split: 36, total 54.\\n\\nNow, back to Burnside.\\nWe need for each group element, the number of colorings fixed by g and with no monochromatic face.\\n\\n1. Identity: fix(g) = 54 (as above)\\n\\n2. Rotations by 120° and 240° around vertex-face axis: 8 elements.\\nFor such a rotation, cycle structure: one fixed vertex (apex), and a 3-cycle of the base.\\nFor the coloring to be fixed by g, the three base vertices must be the same color, say X, and the apex can be any color, say Y.\\nSo coloring: three base vertices color X, apex color Y.\\nNow, we need no face monochromatic.\\nFaces:\\n- The base face: the three base vertices, all color X → so this face is monochromatic!\\nUnless... but they are all X, so yes, the base face is monochromatic.\\nTherefore, every such fixed coloring has the base face monochromatic.\\nThus, there are no such colorings that satisfy the no-monochromatic-face condition.\\nSo fix(g) = 0 for these rotations.\\n\\n3. 180° rotations around edge axes: 3 elements.\\nCycle structure: two 2-cycles, say (A B)(C D)\\nFor coloring to be fixed: A and B same color, C and D same color.\\nSo let color of A,B be X, color of C,D be Y.\\nX and Y can be same or different.\\nNow, check if any face is monochromatic.\\nFaces:\\n- ABC: A,B same X, C is Y. If X=Y, then all same, monochromatic. If X≠Y, then A,B:X, C:Y → not mono.\\n- ABD: A,B:X, D:Y → similarly, mono only if X=Y\\n- ACD: A:X, C:D:Y → if X=Y, mono; else not\\n- BCD: B:X, C:D:Y → same\\nSo, if X=Y, then all vertices same color (since A,B:X, C,D:X), so all faces monochromatic.\\nIf X≠Y, then each face has two vertices of one color and one of the other? Let's see:\\nFace ABC: A,B:X, C:Y → two X, one Y\\nSimilarly, ABD: A,B:X, D:Y → two X, one Y\\nACD: A:X, C,Y, D:Y → one X, two Y\\nBCD: B:X, C:Y, D:Y → one X, two Y\\nSo no face is monochromatic, since each has at least two colors.\\nTherefore, the coloring satisfies the condition iff X ≠ Y.\\nNumber of such colorings: choose X: 3 choices, choose Y: 2 choices (different from X), so 3*2=6.\\nSince the pairs are fixed by the rotation, and we assign colors to the two pairs.\\nYes.\\nSo fix(g) = 6 for each such rotation.\\n\\nNow, sum over g of fix(g):\\n- Identity: 1 * 54 = 54\\n- Vertex-axis rotations (8 elements): 8 * 0 = 0\\n- Edge-axis rotations (3 elements): 3 * 6 = 18\\nTotal sum = 54 + 0 + 18 = 72\\n|G| = 12\\nSo number of distinct colorings up to rotation: 72 / 12 = 6\\n\\nTherefore, answer is 6.\\n\\nNow, to confirm, the valid colorings up to symmetry:\\nFrom earlier, the unrestricted Burnside gave 15, but with restriction.\\n\\nThe orbits:\\nType 1: two pairs of same color, but different colors. Like two red, two blue.\\nUnder rotation, all such are equivalent? Depending on how the pairs are arranged.\\nIn the tetrahedron, two pairs: if the two red are connected by an edge, or not? But in K4, any two vertices are connected.\\nBut the pairing: when we have two of one color, two of another, the two red could be adjacent (share an edge) or opposite.\\nBut in tetrahedron, every pair of vertices is connected by an edge, so no opposite vertices.\\nMoreover, any two vertices form an edge.\\nBut in terms of the partition: the two red vertices may be connected, but since all are connected, the key is whether the two red are paired in the sense of the coloring.\\nBut under rotation, can we map any pair to any other?\\nYes, the rotation group acts transitively on edges, and on pairs of disjoint edges.\\nIn this coloring, the two red vertices form an edge, and the two blue form the opposite edge.\\nAnd since the rotation group acts transitively on the three pairs of opposite edges, all such colorings are in one orbit.\\nBut we have three choices of color pairs: red-blue, red-green, blue-green.\\nBut since we can permute colors, but in counting distinct colorings, colors are distinct.\\nIn our case, colors are labeled: red, blue, green.\\nSo a coloring with two red, two blue is different from two red, two green.\\nBut under rotation, can we map a red-blue coloring to a red-green? No, because colors are fixed.\\nBut the rotation doesn't change colors.\\nSo for a fixed color assignment, say two red, two blue.\\nHow many such colorings? As before, 6: choose which two vertices red, the other two blue.\\nNow, the rotation group acts on these.\\nNumber of rotations: 12.\\nStabilizer: for a given coloring, say A,B red, C,D blue.\\nWhich rotations preserve this?\\nMust map red to red, blue to blue.\\nSo must preserve the partition {{A,B},{C,D}}.\\nRotations that swap A and B, swap C and D: the 180° rotation about the axis through midpoints of AB and CD.\\nAlso, identity.\\nAre there others? A 120° rotation would cycle three vertices, but can't preserve the color classes since sizes different? Here both classes size 2.\\nBut a 120° rotation around a vertex: say fix A, cycle B,C,D. But B is red, C,D blue, so cycling would require B,C,D same color, not possible.\\nSimilarly, no other rotations.\\nSo stabilizer has order 2: identity and the 180° swap.\\nThus, orbit size: |G|/|stab| = 12/2 = 6.\\nBut there are only 6 such colorings (for fixed colors red and blue), so the orbit has size 6, meaning all colorings with two red and two blue are in one orbit.\\nSimilarly for other color pairs.\\nBut we have three choices for the pair of colors: choose which two colors to use: C(3,2)=3, and for each, one orbit of size 6, but total colorings 18, 3*6=18, yes.\\nBut each orbit corresponds to a distinct coloring up to rotation? No: each orbit is a set of equivalent colorings.\\nSo for each choice of two colors, there is one orbit (since all configurations are equivalent under rotation).\\nSo three orbits from the 2,2 split.\\n\\nNow, the 2,1,1 split: two of one color, one each of the other two.\\nSay two red, one blue, one green.\\nNumber of such colorings: choose which two vertices red: C(4,2)=6, then assign blue and green to the other two: 2 ways, so 12 colorings? Earlier I said 3*6*2=36 for all, but per color choice.\\nFor fixed colors: say red appears twice, blue once, green once.\\nThen number: choose two vertices for red: C(4,2)=6, then the remaining two: assign blue and green: 2 ways, so 12 colorings.\\nNow, under rotation, what is the orbit?\\nFix a coloring: say A,B red, C blue, D green.\\nCan rotations map this to others?\\nFor example, is there a rotation that swaps C and D? That would require a rotation that fixes the red pair and swaps the singletons.\\nBut a rotation that swaps C and D and fixes A,B? But fixing two points, in 3D, might be reflection, but we have only rotations.\\nThe 180° rotation about the axis through midpoint of AB and midpoint of CD: this swaps A and B? No, if axis through midpoints, it swaps A and B, and swaps C and D.\\nBut in this coloring, A and B both red, so swapping them is fine, but C and D: C blue, D green, so swapping them changes the coloring unless blue=green.\\nSo it does not preserve the coloring.\\nTo map to a coloring where C and D are swapped, we need a rotation that swaps C and D and fixes A,B, but such a rotation might not exist.\\nNote that the two singleton vertices are distinguishable by color.\\nBut under rotation, can we map any vertex to any other? Yes, rotation group is transitive on vertices.\\nBut here we have symmetry.\\nConsider the stabilizer.\\nOr compute orbit size.\\nTotal number of colorings of this type: 36 (as before)\\n|G|=12\\nIf all orbits same size, but likely not.\\nNote that in such a coloring, the two vertices of the same color (say red) form an edge.\\nThe other two are different colors.\\nNow, the rotation group acts transitively on edges, so we can map any edge to any other.\\nMoreover, for a fixed edge (say AB), we assign it red.\\nThen the other two vertices C and D: we assign colors blue and green.\\nWe can assign C blue, D green or C green, D blue.\\nAre these two related by rotation?\\nIs there a rotation that fixes A and B and swaps C and D?\\nAs above, the 180° rotation about the axis through midpoint of AB and midpoint of CD swaps A and B, and swaps C and D.\\nSwapping A and B: since both red, ok.\\nSwapping C and D: if they have different colors, it changes the coloring.\\nBut if we compose with a color swap, but we can't.\\nSo this rotation does not preserve the coloring, but it maps the coloring to the one where C and D are swapped.\\nSpecifically, if we have coloring f with C blue, D green, after rotation g: swaps C and D, so now C has green, D has blue, so it's the other coloring.\\nAnd since A and B are swapped but same color, unchanged.\\nSo yes, the rotation g maps the coloring f to the coloring f' where the colors of C and D are swapped.\\nTherefore, for a fixed pair of vertices for the double color, the two assignments of the singleton colors are in the same orbit.\\nMoreover, since we can map any edge to any other by rotation, all choices of which edge is the double-colored one are in the same orbit.\\nTherefore, all 12 colorings (for fixed colors: red twice, blue once, green once) are in one orbit.\\nSize: 12, |G|=12, so stabilizer trivial.\\nYes.\\nSo one orbit for this color assignment.\\nBut we have choices: which color appears twice?\\nThree choices: red, blue, or green.\\nFor each choice of the duplicated color, we have one orbit.\\nSo three orbits from the 2,1,1 split.\\n\\nTotal orbits: from 2,2 split: 3 orbits (one for each pair of colors used)\\nFrom 2,1,1 split: 3 orbits (one for each color that is duplicated)\\nTotal 6 orbits.\\nMatches our Burnside calculation.\\n\\nAnd no others, since the restricted count is 54, and 3 orbits of size 6 (for 2,2) : 3*6=18 colorings, 3 orbits of size 12 (for 2,1,1): 3*12=36, total 54, good.\\n\\nSo answer is 6.\\n\\nNow back to Problem 1: I need to output n, but the answer field is for the point value? No.\\nLooking back: \\\"Find a number n less than 1000 ... A correct answer is worth the nearest integer to log₂(n−4) points.\\\"\\nBut the answer to Problem 1 is n, not the points.\\nThe scoring is separate, but we need to provide the answer to the problem, which is n.\\nBut in the JSON, it says \\\"answer_1\\\": \\\"your answer to Problem 1\\\"\\nSo I think answer_1 is n, not the points.\\nThe points are mentioned but not what to output.\\nSo for Problem 1, output n.\\nI can choose n=5.\\nTo get a positive score, but the problem doesn't require it.\\nBut let me see if n=5 is acceptable.\\nIn the example, with n=5, Trevor goes first, can add or remove 4, to 9 or 1, Edward then removes all and wins. Yes.\\nAnd n=5<1000.\\nSo it works.\\n\\nI could choose a larger n, but 5 is fine.\\n\\nSo answer_1 = \"5\"\\nanswer_2 = \"6\"\\n\\nBut in the reasoning, I have it.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
