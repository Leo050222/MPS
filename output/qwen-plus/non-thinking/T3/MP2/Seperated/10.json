The jealousy condition is:\\n- No man will allow his wife to sit next to any man except himself.\\n- No woman will allow her husband to sit next to any woman except herself.\\n\\nLet’s interpret this carefully.\\n\\nCondition 1: A wife cannot sit next to any man other than her own husband.\\nSo for any woman, the only man she can be adjacent to is her husband.\\nSimilarly, for any man, the only woman he can be adjacent to (as a neighbor) is his wife.\\n\\nBut note: each person has two neighbors.\\n\\nSo suppose a wife is sitting between two people. Neither of them can be a man unless that man is her husband. So if a wife is adjacent to any man, it must be her husband. But she might be adjacent to two women — is that allowed?\\n\\nWait: the condition says \\\"no man will allow his wife to sit next to any man except for himself\\\" → so the wife may not be adjacent to another man.\\nSo the wife can only be adjacent to her husband or to women.\\nSimilarly, the husband can only be adjacent to his wife or to men.\\n\\nBut also: \\\"no woman will allow her husband to sit next to any woman except for herself\\\" → so the husband cannot be adjacent to any woman except his wife.\\nSo the husband can only be adjacent to his wife or to men.\\n\\nTherefore, summarizing:\\n- Each wife must have only women or her husband as neighbors.\\n- Each husband must have only men or his wife as neighbors.\\n\\nNow, suppose we look at a mixed pair: a man and a woman who are not married. Can they be adjacent?\\nSuppose man A is adjacent to woman B, where B ≠ wife of A.\\nThen from man A’s perspective: his wife is not involved, but he is adjacent to a woman who is not his wife → violates the second condition (his wife would object because her husband is sitting next to another woman).\\nSimilarly, woman B is adjacent to a man not her husband → violates the first condition (her husband objects because she is sitting next to another man).\\n\\nTherefore: **No man can be adjacent to any woman except his wife, and no woman can be adjacent to any man except her husband.**\\n\\nThus, the only allowed man-woman adjacencies are between spouses.\\n\\nThis means that the seating must be such that men are only adjacent to their wives or to other men, and women only to their husbands or other women.\\n\\nNow consider the structure of the seating.\\n\\nLet’s suppose we try to place people.\\n\\nBecause of the adjacency restriction, whenever a man and a woman are adjacent, they must be a married couple.\\n\\nNow, suppose a man is adjacent to a woman. Then they must be married.\\nBut then that woman can only be adjacent to her husband and women.\\nSo on her other side, she can have either her husband again (impossible, one person) or a woman.\\nSimilarly, the man, on his other side, could have a man or his wife.\\n\\nBut let’s think about blocks.\\n\\nCan we have a block like: M W M? \\nMiddle W is adjacent to two men. She can only be adjacent to her husband. So both men must be her husband → impossible.\\nSo no woman can be between two men.\\nSimilarly, no man can be between two women (because then he is adjacent to two women, only one of whom is his wife → the other adjacency violates the rule).\\n\\nTherefore:\\n- No woman is adjacent to two men\\n- No man is adjacent to two women\\n\\nAlso, a man cannot be adjacent to a woman unless married.\\n\\nNow, what configurations are possible?\\n\\nEach man-woman adjacency must be within a married couple.\\nAnd since no person can be adjacent to two people of opposite sex unless both are spouse (impossible), the only way a man and woman are adjacent is if they are a couple and possibly seated together.\\n\\nMoreover, if a couple is seated together, say M-W or W-M, then at the point of contact, it's okay.\\nBut now, beyond that, the man must be adjacent to men only on his other side, and the woman to women only.\\n\\nSo the idea is that couples must be isolated in some way, or arranged in blocks.\\n\\nBut here’s a key observation: suppose we have a maximal block of consecutive men. Then at the ends, they can only be adjacent to their wives or to men. But outside the block, if a man is at the end, his other neighbor must be his wife (since not a man).\\nSimilarly, a maximal block of women must have at the ends women whose other neighbor is their husband.\\n\\nBut more importantly: the only places where gender changes are allowed are at married couples.\\n\\nBut suppose we have a transition from man to woman. That means a man is adjacent to a woman → they must be married.\\nSimilarly, a woman adjacent to a man → must be married.\\n\\nNow, suppose we go around the circle. Each time the gender changes, it must be between a married couple.\\n\\nBut also, due to the earlier result: no person can be adjacent to two people of opposite sex unless both are spouse — which is impossible. So:\\n- A man cannot have a woman on both sides → so no isolated man between two women.\\n- Similarly, no isolated woman between two men.\\n\\nTherefore, any change from M to W or W to M must happen in pairs: i.e., we can have blocks of men and blocks of women.\\n\\nBut when a block of men meets a block of women, there is a transition: one seat is M, next is W → those two must be married.\\nSimilarly, at the other end of the block, when W meets M again, those two must be married.\\n\\nBut now, suppose we have a block of k men. Then it has two ends (in a circle, but if the whole circle isn't all men, then the block has two boundaries).\\nAt each boundary, the end man is adjacent to a woman → so that woman must be his wife.\\nSimilarly, at the start of a women’s block, the first woman is adjacent to a man → must be her husband.\\n\\nBut now, each such transition requires a married couple to be at the boundary.\\n\\nHowever, each person can only be in one couple.\\n\\nNow, suppose we have b such blocks of men. Since it’s a circle, the number of blocks of men must equal the number of blocks of women, and they alternate.\\nSo we have alternating blocks of men and women around the table.\\n\\nLet there be k blocks of men and k blocks of women.\\nEach block has size at least 1.\\nTotal men = 6, total women = 6.\\n\\nAt each interface between a men’s block and a women’s block, there is a man adjacent to a woman → they must be married.\\nThere are 2k such interfaces (each block has two ends).\\nBut each such interface involves one adjacency between a man and a woman → hence a married couple must be placed there.\\n\\nBut each such adjacency uses one couple.\\nHowever, a single couple can provide at most two such interface adjacencies? No.\\nA couple consists of one man and one woman.\\nThey can be seated adjacent to each other, forming one such interface.\\nBut can one couple serve two interfaces?\\nOnly if they are at two different boundaries, which they can’t be.\\nEach person is in one seat.\\nSo each adjacency is between two people.\\nEach interface corresponds to one such cross-gender adjacency.\\nThere are 2k such adjacencies (since k blocks of men, each with two ends, each end adjacent to a woman’s block).\\nEach such adjacency must be a married couple.\\nSo we need 2k married couples to cover these 2k adjacencies.\\nBut we only have 6 couples.\\nSo 2k ≤ 6 ⇒ k ≤ 3.\\n\\nBut also, k ≥ 1.\\n\\nMoreover, each couple can participate in at most two such cross-gender adjacencies? No — a couple, if seated together, provides one such adjacency (if they are adjacent).\\nBut in the block structure, a couple might be at a corner, but each adjacency is a separate edge.\\nEach cross-gender adjacency requires a distinct couple, because each such adjacency involves one man and one woman who must be married.\\nBut one couple can only be responsible for one such adjacency, unless they are adjacent in two places — impossible.\\nActually, one couple can be adjacent in only one seat pair.\\nSo each cross-gender adjacency uses one couple for that edge.\\nBut one couple might be used for only one such edge.\\nHowever, a single couple could potentially be at two interfaces only if they are split, which is impossible.\\nSo each cross-gender adjacency requires a distinct married couple.\\nBut wait: multiple adjacencies can involve the same couple only if the couple is adjacent in multiple places — impossible.\\nBut actually, one couple can be responsible for only one adjacency (the one between them, if they are seated together).\\nBut in our case, each cross-gender adjacency must be a married couple, but different adjacencies could, in principle, involve the same couple only if the couple is repeated — impossible.\\nSo each cross-gender adjacency requires a distinct couple? No — that’s not true.\\nOne couple can provide one adjacency.\\nBut if a couple is seated together, they form one cross-gender adjacency.\\nBut in our setup, we have 2k such adjacencies (since each of the k men’s blocks has two ends, each connecting to a woman, so two cross-gender edges per block).\\nBut each such edge is a man-woman adjacency, hence must be a married couple.\\nSo we need 2k such married adjacencies.\\nBut each married couple can supply at most one such adjacency (by being seated adjacent to each other).\\nTherefore, we need at least 2k distinct couple-adjacent pairs.\\nBut since there are only 6 couples, and each can contribute at most one adjacency, we must have 2k ≤ 6 ⇒ k ≤ 3.\\n\\nBut also, each couple that is adjacent contributes exactly one such cross-gender edge.\\nSo total number of cross-gender edges is equal to the number of couples who are seated adjacently.\\nBut we have 2k such edges required by the block structure.\\nHence, number of adjacent couples must be exactly 2k.\\nBut there are only 6 couples, so 2k ≤ 6 ⇒ k ≤ 3.\\n\\nNow, is k=0 possible? Only if all are men or all are women — impossible, 6 each.\\nSo k ≥ 1.\\n\\nBut also, in a circular arrangement, the number of blocks of men equals the number of blocks of women, say k, and they alternate.\\n\\nNow, total number of cross-gender adjacencies is 2k.\\nEach must be a married couple seated together.\\nSo exactly 2k couples are seated together (adjacent), and the remaining 6−2k couples are not adjacent.\\nBut is that acceptable? The conditions don’t require couples to be together, only that no forbidden adjacency occurs.\\nBut if a couple is not adjacent, that’s fine, as long as the wife isn’t next to another man, etc.\\n\\nBut now, consider a couple who are not seated adjacent.\\nThen the wife is not adjacent to her husband.\\nHer neighbors must be women only (since she cannot be adjacent to any man except her husband).\\nSimilarly, her husband’s neighbors must be men only.\\nSo if a couple is not adjacent, then the wife must be surrounded entirely by women, and the husband by men.\\nThat means the wife must be in the interior of a women’s block, and the husband in the interior of a men’s block.\\n\\nTherefore, only the people at the boundaries of blocks are adjacent to someone of the opposite sex (and thus must be with their spouse), while interior members are only adjacent to same sex.\\n\\nSo in a men’s block of size s, there are s−2 interior men (if s≥3), and 2 boundary men.\\nSimilarly for women.\\n\\nNow, each boundary position (in a block) is occupied by a person who is adjacent to someone of opposite sex, so must be married to that person.\\nAnd since the adjacency is across the boundary, the boundary man is married to the boundary woman in the adjacent women’s block.\\n\\nNow, for each interface between a men’s block and a women’s block, we have one such married pair adjacent.\\nThere are 2k such interfaces (k blocks, each with two interfaces).\\nSo 2k such adjacent married couples.\\nEach such adjacency uses one couple.\\nSince each couple can be used only once, we need 2k distinct couples to be the ones who are at the boundaries and seated adjacently to their spouses.\\n\\nThe remaining 6−2k couples must be in the interior of blocks, so not adjacent to their spouses, but that’s ok as long as they are surrounded by same sex.\\n\\nNow, total number of men is 6.\\nWe have k blocks of men.\\nLet the sizes be m1, m2, ..., mk, each mi ≥ 1, sum mi = 6.\\nSimilarly, women’s blocks: w1, ..., wk, sum wj = 6.\\n\\nIn men’s block i, number of boundary men is 2 (the two ends), unless the block size is 1.\\nIf mi = 1, then that single man is adjacent to two women (one on each side, since blocks alternate), so he is at two interfaces.\\nSimilarly for a woman alone in a block.\\n\\nAh! This is important.\\n\\nIf a block has size 1, then that person is adjacent to two people of the opposite sex (since the two neighbors are from the adjacent blocks, which are of opposite gender).\\nFor example, a single man between two women’s blocks: he is adjacent to two women.\\nBut the condition: a man cannot be adjacent to any woman except his wife.\\nSo both of these women must be his wife — impossible.\\nSimilarly, a single woman between two men’s blocks would have to be married to both men — impossible.\\n\\nTherefore: **No block can have size 1.**\\nEvery block (of men or women) must have size at least 2.\\n\\nBecause if a man is in a block of size 1, he is adjacent to two women → both must be his wife → impossible.\\nSimilarly for a woman.\\n\\nTherefore, each block has size at least 2.\\n\\nNow, we have k blocks of men, each of size ≥2, sum to 6.\\nSimilarly for women.\\nSo k ≤ 3 (since 2k ≤ 6).\\nSimilarly, k ≥ 1.\\n\\nBut also, 2k ≤ 6 ⇒ k ≤ 3.\\n\\nNow, sum of k terms, each ≥2, is 6 ⇒ minimum sum is 2k, so 2k ≤ 6 ⇒ k ≤ 3.\\nAnd 2k ≤ 6 ⇒ k ≤ 3.\\nBut also, since each block ≥2, we need 2k ≤ 6 ⇒ k ≤ 3, and similarly for women.\\n\\nNow, possible k: 1, 2, 3.\\n\\nTry k=3:\\nThen 3 blocks of men, each size ≥2, sum to 6 ⇒ each must be exactly size 2.\\nSimilarly, women’s blocks: each size 2.\\nSo we have 3 blocks of 2 men, 3 blocks of 2 women, alternating.\\n\\nSimilarly, k=2: then 2 blocks of men, each ≥2, sum to 6 ⇒ possibilities: (2,4), (3,3), (4,2)\\nSame for women.\\n\\nk=1: one block of 6 men, one block of 6 women.\\n\\nNow, check each.\\n\\nFirst, k=3:\\nBlocks: M M W W M M W W M M W W — but arranged in circle.\\nSequence: block of 2M, 2W, 2M, 2W, 2M, 2W.\\nSince k=3, three of each.\\nArranged as: M-block, W-block, M-block, W-block, M-block, W-block, and back.\\n\\nEach M-block has size 2, so two men: they are adjacent to each other, and each is at a boundary.\\nThe first man is adjacent to the previous W-block and the second man.\\nThe second man is adjacent to the first man and the next W-block.\\nSo each man in a size-2 block is adjacent to one man and one woman.\\nSimilarly for women.\\n\\nNow, the woman he is adjacent to must be his wife.\\nBut each man is adjacent to one woman (from the adjacent W-block).\\nSimilarly, each woman is adjacent to one man (from adjacent M-block).\\n\\nIn a size-2 block of women: the two women are adjacent to each other, and each is adjacent to one man from the neighboring M-blocks.\\n\\nNow, for a man in an M-block: he is adjacent to one woman (say, from the W-block on his left or right).\\nThat woman must be his wife.\\nSimilarly, that woman is adjacent to him and to another man (from the other side, since her block is between two M-blocks).\\n\\nBut the woman is adjacent to two men: one on the left, one on the right.\\nBut the condition: she cannot be adjacent to any man except her husband.\\nTherefore, both men must be her husband — impossible.\\n\\nAh! Critical point.\\n\\nIn k=3, each woman is in a W-block of size 2, so she is adjacent to one woman and two men? No.\\nIn a linear sense, but it’s a circle.\\nTake a particular woman in a W-block.\\nShe has two neighbors.\\nSince the W-block has size 2, the two women are adjacent.\\nSo one neighbor is the other woman in the block.\\nThe other neighbor is from the adjacent M-block.\\nBut which side?\\nSuppose the arrangement is: ... M M | W W | M M ...\\nSo positions: seat i: M, i+1: M, i+2: W, i+3: W, i+4: M, i+5: M, ...\\nThen seat i+2 (W) is adjacent to i+1 (M) and i+3 (W).\\nSeat i+3 (W) is adjacent to i+2 (W) and i+4 (M).\\nSo each woman is adjacent to one man and one woman.\\nSimilarly, each man is adjacent to one woman and one man.\\n\\nNow, for woman at i+2: she is adjacent to man at i+1.\\nSo that man must be her husband.\\nSimilarly, woman at i+3: adjacent to man at i+4 → must be her husband.\\n\\nNow, man at i+1: he is adjacent to woman at i+2 and to man at i.\\nSo the woman at i+2 must be his wife.\\nSimilarly, man at i+4: adjacent to woman at i+3 → must be his wife.\\n\\nNow, is there a problem? Each person is adjacent to only one person of opposite sex, so only one constraint.\\nSo as long as we assign the spouses accordingly, it might work.\\n\\nBut now, the man at i+1 is married to woman at i+2.\\nMan at i+4 is married to woman at i+3.\\n\\nNow, what about the other adjacencies? None.\\nSo it seems possible.\\n\\nBut earlier I thought a woman adjacent to two men, but no — in this case, each woman is adjacent to only one man.\\nSimilarly for men.\\n\\nIn k=3, with block size 2, each person at the boundary is adjacent to one same-sex and one opposite-sex neighbor.\\nInterior? But size 2, no interior; both are boundary.\\nBut each has only one opposite-sex neighbor.\\nSo the condition is satisfied as long as that opposite-sex neighbor is their spouse.\\n\\nMoreover, no one is adjacent to two opposite-sex people.\\nSo it’s ok.\\n\\nEarlier I mistakenly thought that a woman in the middle of a block would be between two men, but no — in a block of two women, each is at the end, so only one side is connected to a man.\\n\\nSo k=3 is possible.\\n\\nNow, what about k=2?\\nTwo blocks of men, each size at least 2, sum to 6: possibilities: (2,4), (3,3), (4,2)\\nSimilarly for women.\\n\\nTake a men’s block of size 4.\\nThen the two end men are adjacent to women (from the adjacent women’s blocks), and the two middle men are adjacent only to men.\\nSo the two end men must have their wives in the adjacent women’s blocks.\\nThe two middle men are not adjacent to any woman, so their wives must not be adjacent to them, but must be somewhere, and since they are not adjacent to any man except possibly their wife, but they are surrounded by men, so as long as their wife is not next to another man, but wait.\\n\\nThe middle men are adjacent only to men, so they are not adjacent to any woman, so the condition “no man will allow his wife to sit next to any man except himself” — this is about the wife’s adjacency, not his.\\n\\nLet’s clarify.\\nThe condition is symmetric:\\n- For each man, his wife must not be adjacent to any man except him.\\n- For each woman, her husband must not be adjacent to any woman except her.\\n\\nSo for a middle man in a men’s block of size 4: he is adjacent only to men. That’s fine for him. But his wife — where is she?\\nShe must be in a women’s block.\\nShe must not be adjacent to any man except her husband.\\nBut her husband is in the men’s block, not adjacent to her (since he’s in the middle, not at the end).\\nSo she is not adjacent to her husband.\\nTherefore, to satisfy the condition, she must not be adjacent to any man at all.\\nBecause if she is adjacent to a man, it must be her husband, but she’s not adjacent to him, so she cannot be adjacent to any man.\\nTherefore, she must be surrounded only by women.\\nSo she must be in the interior of a women’s block.\\nSimilarly, for a women’s block, interior women are not adjacent to any man.\\n\\nIn a women’s block of size s, the number of women who are not adjacent to any man is max(s−2, 0) if s≥2, but only if s>2; if s=2, both women are adjacent to one man each.\\nIf s=3, the middle woman is adjacent only to women.\\nSimilarly for larger.\\n\\nBack to k=2.\\nSuppose men’s blocks: sizes a and b, a+b=6, a≥2,b≥2.\\nNumber of men who are at boundaries: each block has 2 ends, so 2 per block, total 4 boundary men.\\nBut if a block has size 2, both men are boundary; if size 3, two boundary, one interior; size 4, two boundary, two interior, etc.\\nTotal boundary men: always 2 per block, so 4 for k=2.\\nSimilarly, interior men: 6−4=2.\\nThese 2 interior men must have their wives in the interior of women’s blocks, so not adjacent to any man.\\nTherefore, in the women’s blocks, we need at least 2 women who are not adjacent to any man.\\nSimilarly, each women’s block of size s has max(s−2,0) interior women (not adjacent to any man).\\nTotal interior women needed: at least 2.\\nWith k=2 women’s blocks, total interior women = sum over blocks of max(si−2,0).\\nTotal women =6, number of boundary women = 4 (2 per block), so interior women = 6−4=2.\\nSo we need exactly 2 interior women, which matches.\\nSo as long as each women’s block has size at least 2, and total interior is 2, which is automatic.\\nFor example, if both women’s blocks size 3, then each has one interior woman, total 2.\\nIf one size 2, one size 4: size 2 has 0 interior, size 4 has 2 interior, total 2.\\nSimilarly.\\nSo k=2 is possible.\\n\\nNow k=1: one block of 6 men, one block of 6 women.\\nThen the men’s block has two end men (adjacent to women), and four interior men (adjacent only to men).\\nSimilarly, women’s block: two end women, four interior women.\\n\\nThe two end men are each adjacent to one woman (at the interface).\\nSpecifically, at the two junctions: between last man and first woman, and between last woman and first man.\\nSay the arrangement is: M M M M M M W W W W W W\\nThen man at position 6 is adjacent to man 5 and woman 1.\\nWoman 1 is adjacent to man 6 and woman 2.\\nSimilarly, woman 6 is adjacent to woman 5 and man 1.\\nMan 1 is adjacent to woman 6 and man 2.\\n\\nSo the two end men: man 1 and man 6, each adjacent to one woman.\\nSimilarly, end women: woman 1 and woman 6, each adjacent to one man.\\n\\nThe interior men (2,3,4,5) are adjacent only to men, so their wives must not be adjacent to any man, so must be interior women.\\nSimilarly, interior women (2,3,4,5) must have husbands who are interior men.\\n\\nTotal interior men: 4, interior women: 4.\\nSo we need 4 couples where both are interior, so not adjacent to each other.\\nAnd 2 couples where the husband is an end man and wife is an end woman, and they are adjacent.\\n\\nSpecifically, man 1 is adjacent to woman 6 → so if they are married, ok.\\nMan 6 is adjacent to woman 1 → if married, ok.\\nBut man 1 is adjacent to woman 6, so for man 1, the woman he is adjacent to must be his wife.\\nSimilarly, woman 6 is adjacent to man 1, so her husband must be man 1.\\nSimilarly, man 6 and woman 1 must be married.\\n\\nSo we must have: man 1 married to woman 6, and man 6 married to woman 1.\\n\\nThe other four men (2,3,4,5) are interior, so their wives must be interior women (2,3,4,5), and since they are not adjacent, but as long as the wives are not adjacent to any man except their husband, but the interior women are adjacent only to women, so they are not adjacent to any man, so the condition is satisfied (since they are not adjacent to any man, so certainly not to a man other than husband).\\nSimilarly for the men.\\n\\nSo k=1 is also possible.\\n\\nTherefore, k=1,2,3 are all possible in principle.\\n\\nNow, we need to count the number of ways.\\n\\nBut remember, it's a round table, so rotations are considered the same.\\nAlso, possibly reflections, but usually in such problems, only rotations are considered identical, unless specified.\\nThe problem says “distinct ways”, and for round tables, typically we fix one position or divide by n.\\n\\nStandard approach: for circular arrangements, we fix one person's position to account for rotational symmetry.\\n\\nBut here, people are distinct.\\n\\nSo total number without considering symmetry would be large, but we need to divide by 12 for rotations, or fix one person.\\n\\nBetter to fix one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry.\\n\\nNow, let’s handle each k separately.\\n\\nFirst, k=3:\\nWe have 3 blocks of 2 men, 3 blocks of 2 women, alternating.\\n\\nThe pattern around the table must be alternating blocks: since k=3, and circular, the sequence must be M,W,M,W,M,W or W,M,W,M,W,M.\\nBut these are reflections of each other.\\nAre reflections considered distinct? Usually yes, unless table has indistinguishable directions.\\nTypically in such problems, we consider two arrangements the same only if one can be rotated to the other, not reflected.\\nSo we should count both.\\n\\nBut let’s see.\\nFirst, choose the starting gender.\\nCase 1: starts with M-block.\\nThen sequence: M,M, W,W, M,M, W,W, M,M, W,W\\nBut since circular, “starts with” is arbitrary.\\nBetter to think of the arrangement up to rotation.\\n\\nSince the block structure is symmetric, we can fix the position of one particular person.\\n\\nNote that all blocks are size 2, so the arrangement has a periodicity.\\n\\nTotal number of ways:\\nFirst, arrange the blocks.\\nWe have 3 identical-type blocks of M-pairs, but the men are distinct, so the blocks are distinguishable by who is in them.\\n\\nStep 1: partition the 6 men into 3 unordered pairs, because the blocks are indistinct in order? No, the blocks are arranged in a circle.\\n\\nThe three men’s blocks will be placed at three positions around the table, separated by women’s blocks.\\nSince the table is circular, the arrangement of the blocks matters up to rotation.\\n\\nFirst, arrange the 3 men’s blocks in the circle.\\nBut they are separated by women’s blocks.\\n\\nThe skeleton is fixed: alternating blocks of size 2.\\nThere are two possible patterns: MWMWMW or WMWMWM.\\nBut since the table is round, rotating doesn’t change, but reflecting might.\\nActually, MWMWMW rotated is still the same type.\\nBut MWMWMW and WMWMWM are different if we don’t allow reflection.\\nFor example, in one, a particular man is in an M-block, in the other he might be, but the relative positions.\\nBut since we can rotate, but not reflect, these two are distinct unless there is a reflection symmetry.\\n\\nTo avoid confusion, let’s fix one person’s position.\\n\\nFix man A at position 1.\\nSince the arrangement is circular, we can do this to eliminate rotational symmetry.\\n\\nNow, man A is in a men’s block of size 2.\\nHis block must be two consecutive seats.\\nSince he is at seat 1, his block could be seats 1-2 or seats 12-1.\\nBut since circular, seat 12 and 1 are adjacent.\\n\\nThe block is two consecutive seats with two men.\\nSo man A is at seat 1, so his block is either {12,1} or {1,2}.\\n\\nNow, because of the block structure, and k=3, the blocks are every other pair.\\n\\nSuppose the men’s blocks are at positions (1,2), (5,6), (9,10), for example.\\nBut with man A at 1, and his block including seat 2.\\nThen seats: 1:M, 2:M, 3:W, 4:W, 5:M, 6:M, 7:W, 8:W, 9:M, 10:M, 11:W, 12:W\\nOr if his block is (12,1): 12:M, 1:M, 2:W, 3:W, 4:M, 5:M, 6:W, 7:W, 8:M, 9:M, 10:W, 11:W\\n\\nIn the first case, the men’s blocks start at odd positions: 1,5,9\\nIn the second, at even: 12,4,8\\nBut since we fixed seat 1, these are different.\\n\\nNow, in both cases, the pattern is determined by where the block is.\\n\\nBut notice that in the first arrangement, seat 1 and 2 are men, 3 and 4 women, etc.\\nIn the second, seat 12 and 1 men, 2 and 3 women, etc.\\n\\nThese are actually rotations of each other? Let’s see.\\nFirst arrangement: seats 1:M,2:M,3:W,4:W,5:M,6:M,7:W,8:W,9:M,10:M,11:W,12:W\\nSecond: 1:M,2:W,3:W,4:M,5:M,6:W,7:W,8:M,9:M,10:W,11:W,12:M\\nDifferent.\\nAnd not a rotation of the first.\\nFor example, in first, seat 2 is M, in second, seat 2 is W.\\nSo distinct.\\n\\nBut are they both valid for k=3?\\nYes.\\n\\nNow, with man A fixed at seat 1, how many choices for his block?\\nHe must be in a men’s block of size 2, so his partner in the block is either at seat 2 or at seat 12.\\nTwo choices: left or right.\\n\\nCase 1: man A and another man B at seats 1 and 2 (order to be determined).\\nThen the block is {1,2}.\\nThen the next block must be women at {3,4}, then men at {5,6}, women at {7,8}, men at {9,10}, women at {11,12}.\\n\\nCase 2: man A and man C at seats 12 and 1.\\nThen women at {2,3}, men at {4,5}, women at {6,7}, men at {8,9}, women at {10,11}.\\n\\nSo two possible configurations for the block placement, given man A at seat 1.\\n\\nNow, for each such configuration, we need to assign people.\\n\\nTake Case 1: men’s blocks at (1,2), (5,6), (9,10); women’s at (3,4), (7,8), (11,12)\\n\\nFirst, assign the men to the blocks.\\nWe have 6 men, including man A.\\nMan A is already in the first block (seats 1 and 2).\\nWe need to choose his block partner: there are 5 other men, so 5 choices for who is in the block with him.\\nCall him B.\\nNow, the block has two seats: 1 and 2.\\nWe can seat A and B in 2 ways: A at 1, B at 2, or B at 1, A at 2.\\nBut we fixed man A at seat 1, so only one way: A at 1, B at 2.\\nSo no choice; B is at 2.\\n\\nNow, remaining 4 men to be paired into two blocks: for seats (5,6) and (9,10).\\nFirst, partition 4 men into 2 unordered pairs.\\nNumber of ways to partition 4 distinct men into 2 unordered pairs: \\binom{4}{2}/2 = 6/2 = 3 ways. (Since choosing two for first pair, but the order of pairs doesn't matter, so divide by 2.)\\n\\nStandard formula: number of perfect matchings for 2n objects is (2n-1)!! = (2n)! / (2^n n!)\\nFor 4 men, number of ways to divide into 2 unordered pairs: \\binom{4}{2} = 6 ways to choose first pair, but then the remaining two automatically pair, and since the order of the pairs doesn't matter, we divide by 2, so 3 ways.\\n\\nThen, assign these two pairs to the two blocks: (5,6) and (9,10).\\nThere are 2 blocks, so 2! = 2 ways to assign the two pairs to the two blocks.\\n\\nThen, for each block, 2 ways to seat the two men in the two seats.\\nSo for each pair in a block, 2 ways.\\n\\nSo total for men: after fixing A at 1, and choosing B (5 choices), then partitioning remaining 4 into two pairs: 3 ways, assigning to blocks: 2 ways, seating in each block: 2 * 2 = 4 ways.\\nSo total men: 5 * 3 * 2 * 4 = 5*3*2*4 = 120.\\n\\nBut let me compute: 5 choices for B.\\nThen for the other two blocks: number of ways to assign the 4 men to the 4 seats: first, choose who goes to block (5,6): \\binom{4}{2} = 6 ways to choose the two men, then 2 ways to seat them in (5,6), then the remaining two go to (9,10) with 2 ways to seat them.\\nSo 6 * 2 * 2 = 24 ways.\\nAnd 5 choices for B, so 5*24=120.\\nSame.\\n\\nNow, for women.\\nWe have 6 women, each married to one of the 6 men.\\nNow, the adjacency constraints: each man is adjacent to one woman.\\nSpecifically:\\n- Man at seat 1 (A) is adjacent to seat 12 and seat 2. Seat 2 is man B, so only seat 12 is woman. So he is adjacent to the woman at seat 12.\\nSimilarly, man at seat 2 (B) is adjacent to seat 1 (man) and seat 3 (woman). So adjacent to woman at seat 3.\\nSimilarly, man at 5: adjacent to 4 and 6; 6 is man, 4 is woman (since 3,4 are women), so woman at 4.\\nMan at 6: adjacent to 5 (man) and 7 (woman), so woman at 7.\\nMan at 9: adjacent to 8 and 10; 10 is man, 8 is woman (7,8 women), so woman at 8.\\nMan at 10: adjacent to 9 (man) and 11 (woman), so woman at 11.\\n\\nSo each man is adjacent to exactly one woman: specifically, the one in the previous block or next.\\nList:\\n- A (1) adj to woman at 12\\n- B (2) adj to woman at 3\\n- Man at 5 adj to woman at 4\\n- Man at 6 adj to woman at 7\\n- Man at 9 adj to woman at 8\\n- Man at 10 adj to woman at 11\\n\\nNow, for each man, the woman he is adjacent to must be his wife.\\nSo:\\n- Wife of A is at seat 12\\n- Wife of B is at seat 3\\n- Wife of man at 5 is at seat 4\\n- Wife of man at 6 is at seat 7\\n- Wife of man at 9 is at seat 8\\n- Wife of man at 10 is at seat 11\\n\\nNow, the women’s blocks are: (3,4), (7,8), (11,12)\\nSo seats 3 and 4 are both women, adjacent.\\nSimilarly, 7-8, 11-12.\\n\\nNow, we know who must be at each seat:\\n- Seat 3: wife of B\\n- Seat 4: wife of man at 5\\n- Seat 7: wife of man at 6\\n- Seat 8: wife of man at 9\\n- Seat 11: wife of man at 10\\n- Seat 12: wife of A\\n\\nAll are determined!\\nOnce the men are assigned, the wives are forced to specific seats.\\n\\nMoreover, we need to check if this assignment is consistent with the block assignments.\\nFor example, wife of A is at 12, wife of man at 10 is at 11, and seats 11 and 12 are a women’s block, so they are together, fine.\\nSimilarly, wife of B at 3, wife of man at 5 at 4, and seats 3,4 are a block, so they are adjacent, good.\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nNow, is there any choice? No, the seats are all determined by who the husbands are.\\nSo once men are seated, the women are completely determined.\\n\\nBut we need to make sure that the women are correctly assigned to their husbands, but since each woman is married to one man, and we are placing her at the seat adjacent to her husband, it should be fine.\\n\\nFor example, wife of A is placed at 12, and A is at 1, and 12 and 1 are adjacent, yes.\\nWife of B at 3, B at 2, 2 and 3 adjacent, yes.\\nWife of man at 5 at 4, 4 and 5 adjacent, yes.\\nEtc.\\nAll good.\\n\\nSo for this configuration (men’s blocks at (1,2),(5,6),(9,10)), with A fixed at 1, we have 120 ways for men, and women determined.\\n\\nBut is that correct? 120 ways, but let's see what 120 is.\\nTotal ways to assign men: we have to assign men to the six men's seats.\\nSeats 1,2,5,6,9,10.\\nSeat 1 is fixed for A.\\nSo assign A to 1.\\nThen seat 2: 5 choices (any other man).\\nThen seats 5,6: choose 2 out of remaining 4: \\binom{4}{2}=6, assign to 5 and 6: 2 ways, so 6*2=12.\\nThen seats 9,10: remaining 2 men, 2 ways to assign.\\nSo total: 5 * 12 * 2 = 120, yes.\\nAnd women determined.\\n\\nNow, this is for one block configuration: men’s blocks including (1,2).\\n\\nNow, the other case: when man A is in a block with seat 12.\\nSo seats 12 and 1 are the first men’s block.\\nThen, as above, women at (2,3), men at (4,5), women at (6,7), men at (8,9), women at (10,11).\\n\\nMan A at seat 1.\\nThen his block partner is at seat 12.\\nChoose who: 5 choices.\\nThen seat 12: that man, say C.\\n\\nNow, men’s blocks: (12,1), (4,5), (8,9)\\nSeats for men: 12,1,4,5,8,9\\nFixed: A at 1, C at 12.\\nRemaining 4 men to seats 4,5,8,9.\\n\\nAssign to blocks: block (4,5) and (8,9)\\nPartition 4 men into two pairs: 3 ways, assign to blocks: 2 ways, seat each pair: 2*2=4 ways, so 3*2*4=24 ways.\\nTotal for men: 5 * 24 = 120 ways.\\n\\nNow, adjacencies for men:\\n- Man at 12: adjacent to 11 and 1. 1 is man (A), so adjacent to woman at 11.\\n- Man at 1: adjacent to 12 (man) and 2 (woman), so adjacent to woman at 2.\\n- Man at 4: adjacent to 3 and 5; 5 is man, 3 is woman (2,3 women), so woman at 3.\\n- Man at 5: adjacent to 4 (man) and 6 (woman), so woman at 6.\\n- Man at 8: adjacent to 7 and 9; 9 is man, 7 is woman (6,7 women), so woman at 7.\\n- Man at 9: adjacent to 8 (man) and 10 (woman), so woman at 10.\\n\\nSo:\\n- Wife of man at 12 is at 11\\n- Wife of man at 1 (A) is at 2\\n- Wife of man at 4 is at 3\\n- Wife of man at 5 is at 6\\n- Wife of man at 8 is at 7\\n- Wife of man at 9 is at 10\\n\\nWomen’s blocks: (2,3), (6,7), (10,11)\\nSo:\\n- Seat 2: wife of A\\n- Seat 3: wife of man at 4\\n- Seat 6: wife of man at 5\\n- Seat 7: wife of man at 8\\n- Seat 10: wife of man at 9\\n- Seat 11: wife of man at 12\\n\\nAgain, all determined once men are seated.\\n\\nSo another 120 ways.\\n\\nTherefore, for k=3, with man A fixed at seat 1, total arrangements: 120 (first config) + 120 (second config) = 240.\\n\\nBut is that all for k=3? Yes.\\n\\nNow, this is with one person fixed, so it accounts for rotational symmetry.\\n\\nNow, move to k=2.\\n\\nk=2: two blocks of men, two of women, alternating, each block size at least 2.\\n\\nWith man A fixed at seat 1.\\n\\nThe block structure: since alternating, and circular, the two men’s blocks are opposite, similarly for women.\\n\\nThe size of the blocks can vary.\\n\\nLet the size of the first men’s block be s, then the other is 6−s, with s≥2, 6−s≥2, so s=2,3,4.\\nSimilarly for women, but independently? No, the block sizes are determined by the arrangement.\\n\\nActually, the women’s block sizes must sum to 6, each ≥2, so also 2,3,4.\\n\\nBut the arrangement is determined by where the cuts are.\\n\\nWith man A at seat 1, and he is in a men’s block of size m ≥2.\\nHis block could extend to the right or left, but since fixed at 1, and circular, we can assume the block includes seats 1,2,...,m or seats 12,11,...,1, but to avoid double-counting, perhaps assume the block extends clockwise.\\n\\nSince the table is circular, we can define the block containing A.\\nLet the size of A’s men’s block be s, s=2,3,4.\\nThen the block occupies s consecutive seats including seat 1.\\nIt could be centered at 1, but better to specify the starting point.\\n\\nThe block can start at seat k and go to k+s−1.\\nBut since it contains seat 1, and size s, the starting seat can be from 1−s+1 to 1, modulo 12.\\nBut since circular, and we fixed seat 1, we can list the possible starting points.\\n\\nFor a block of size s containing seat 1, the first seat of the block can be from max(1,13−s) to 1, but in modular arithmetic.\\nFor example, s=2: block can be (12,1) or (1,2)\\ns=3: (11,12,1), (12,1,2), (1,2,3)\\ns=4: (10,11,12,1), (11,12,1,2), (12,1,2,3), (1,2,3,4)\\n\\nBut in our case, for k=2, there are only two men’s blocks, so the block sizes determine the arrangement.\\n\\nMoreover, the two men’s blocks are separated by women’s blocks.\\n\\nSo, once we fix the size s of the block containing A, and its position, then the other men’s block is determined.\\n\\nBut also, the women’s blocks are in between.\\n\\nMoreover, the size of the women’s blocks will affect the adjacencies.\\n\\nLet’s denote.\\nSuppose the men’s block containing A has size s, 2≤s≤4.\\nThen the other men’s block has size 6−s.\\n\\nThe block containing A must be placed.\\nAs above, for size s, there are s possible positions for the block that contain seat 1: namely, the block can start at seat 1−i for i=0 to s−1, where seat numbers mod 12, with 1 to 12.\\nFor example, s=2: start at 12 or 1.\\ns=3: start at 11,12, or 1.\\ns=4: start at 10,11,12, or 1.\\n\\nBut each of these determines the entire block.\\n\\nThen, once this block is placed, the remaining men’s seats are determined, and they must be in one contiguous block of size 6−s, since k=2.\\nSimilarly for women.\\n\\nBut the remaining men’s seats may not be contiguous.\\nFor example, if A’s block is (1,2) size 2, then seats 1,2 taken by men.\\nRemaining men: 4, to be placed in one block of size 4.\\nThe available seats are 3 to 12, but must be 4 consecutive seats not including 1,2.\\nBut 3,4,5,6 or 4,5,6,7, etc., up to 12,1,2,3 but 1,2 are taken, so cannot include 1 or 2.\\nSo possible blocks: 3-6, 4-7, 5-8, 6-9, 7-10, 8-11, 9-12.\\nBut size 4, and not overlapping with 1,2.\\nNow, is 3-6 contiguous? Yes.\\nBut after placing men’s block at 1,2, the seats are 1:M,2:M, then 3 to 12.\\nTo have a single block of 4 men, it must be 4 consecutive seats among 3-12.\\nBut the issue is that the women’s blocks must be in between, but with k=2, there should be two women’s blocks, each separating the men’s blocks.\\n\\nAfter placing one men’s block, say at (1,2), then the next seats are 3,4,etc.\\nTo have only two men’s blocks, the other men’s block must be somewhere else, and the seats in between must be women, but then there might be multiple women’s blocks if not careful.\\n\\nFor example, if men’s blocks at (1,2) and (5,6,7,8), then seats 3,4 are women, 9,10,11,12 are women, so women’s blocks at (3,4) and (9,10,11,12), so two blocks, good.\\nIf men at (1,2) and (3,4,5,6), but then seats 1,2,3,4,5,6 are men, which is one block of size 6, not two.\\nSo to have two separate blocks, there must be at least one woman between them.\\n\\nIn fact, for two men’s blocks, they must be separated by women’s blocks, so the gap between them must be filled with women, and since only two blocks, the women must be in two contiguous groups: one between the two men’s blocks in one direction, and the other in the other direction, but in a circle, it's two arcs.\\n\\nSpecifically, the two men’s blocks divide the circle into two arcs, each arc must be filled with a women’s block.\\nSo the size of the women’s blocks are determined by the gaps.\\n\\nWhen we place the first men’s block (containing A) of size s, and it occupies certain seats, then the remaining 6−s men must be in a single contiguous block of size 6−s.\\nMoreover, the two blocks must not be adjacent, so there is at least one seat between them in each direction, but since women fill the rest, it's automatic.\\n\\nThe key is that after placing the first block, the position of the second block is constrained.\\n\\nPerhaps it's better to think that the two men’s blocks are placed with a certain distance.\\n\\nSince the arrangement is symmetric, and we have fixed A at 1, we can let the size of A’s block be s, and the starting position.\\n\\nFor size s, there are s possible ways to place a block of size s containing seat 1, as listed earlier.\\nThen, the remaining 6−s men must be placed in a single contiguous block of size 6−s in the remaining seats.\\nBut the remaining seats may not allow a contiguous block of size 6−s, or there might be multiple choices, but in this case, since the men’s seats are only in two blocks, the remaining men’s seats must be exactly one contiguous block.\\n\\nAfter removing the first block’s s seats, the remaining 12−s seats are for women and the other men’s block.\\nAmong these 12−s seats, we need to place a contiguous block of 6−s men, and the rest women.\\nBut the women will automatically form two blocks: one on each side of the men’s blocks, but in the circle, when you have two men’s blocks, the women are in the two arcs between them.\\n\\nFor the other men’s block to be contiguous and of size 6−s, and not adjacent to the first block, it must be placed in one of the gaps.\\n\\nBut in the circle, after placing one block of s consecutive seats, the remaining seats are a single arc of 12−s seats.\\nWithin this arc, we need to place a contiguous block of 6−s men.\\nThis is possible only if 6−s ≤ 12−s, which is true, and the block can be placed in various positions within the arc.\\n\\nThe number of ways to place a contiguous block of size t in a arc of size L is L−t+1, if L≥t.\\nHere t=6−s, L=12−s, so number of positions is (12−s) − (6−s) + 1 = 12−s−6+s+1 = 7.\\nSo always 7 possible positions for the second men’s block, regardless of s.\\n\\nIs that right?\\nL = 12−s seats in a row (since the first block breaks the circle into a line).\\nNumber of ways to place a contiguous block of size t=6−s in a line of L=12−s seats is L−t+1 = (12−s) − (6−s) + 1 = 12−s−6+s+1 = 7.\\nYes, always 7, for s=2,3,4.\\n\\nBut is that correct? For example, s=2, L=10, t=4, number of positions: 10−4+1=7, yes.\\nPositions: seats 3-6,4-7,5-8,6-9,7-10,8-11,9-12.\\nAll within 3 to 12, size 4, contiguous.\\nNone of these include seat 1 or 2, good.\\nAnd they are all valid, and each will create two women’s blocks: for example, if second block at 3-6, then men at 1,2 and 3,4,5,6, but then seats 1,2,3,4,5,6 are all men, which is one block, not two.\\nOh! Problem.\\nIf the second block is adjacent to the first, then they merge into one big block.\\nFor example, if first block at (1,2), second at (3,4,5,6), then seats 1 to 6 are men, contiguous, so only one men’s block, not two.\\nBut we want k=2, so the two blocks must be separated by at least one woman.\\nSo we need a gap of at least one seat between the two men’s blocks.\\n\\nTherefore, when placing the second block, it must not be adjacent to the first block.\\n\\nIn the arc of 12−s seats, which is a line from seat a to b, the first block occupies, say, seats p to p+s−1.\\nThen the remaining seats are from p+s to p−1 mod 12, but in order, say from c to d, with d−c+1=12−s.\\nThen the second men’s block of size t=6−s must be placed within c to d, and not adjacent to the first block.\\nAdjacent means that it doesn't touch seat p−1 or p+s.\\nSince the first block is at p to p+s−1, the seats adjacent to it are p−1 and p+s.\\nIn the remaining arc, seat p+s is included if it's in the arc, which it is, since the arc starts at p+s.\\nSimilarly, seat p−1 is at the other end.\\nSo in the line from c=p+s to d=p−1, the seats are c,c+1,...,d.\\nSeat c = p+s is adjacent to the first block (since p+s−1 is in first block, p+s is next).\\nSimilarly, seat d = p−1 is adjacent to p, which is in first block.\\nSo both ends of the arc are adjacent to the first block.\\nTo avoid adjacency, the second men’s block must not include seat c or seat d.\\nMoreover, since it's a block of size t, it must be completely within c+1 to d−1.\\nSo the available positions are from c+1 to d−1, which has length (d−1) − (c+1) + 1 = d−c−1 = (12−s) −1 = 11−s.\\nThen number of ways to place a contiguous block of size t=6−s in a line of length L' = 11−s is max(L'−t+1, 0) if L'≥t, else 0.\\nSo L'−t+1 = (11−s) − (6−s) + 1 = 11−s−6+s+1 = 6.\\nSo always 6 ways, for s=2,3,4.\\n\\nCheck: s=2, t=4, L'=11−2=9, number of positions: 9−4+1=6.\\nPositions: in seats 3 to 12, but not including 3 or 12 (since 3 is adjacent to 2, 12 is adjacent to 1), so from 4 to 11.\\nBlock of size 4: 4-7,5-8,6-9,7-10,8-11,9-12 but 9-12 includes 12, which is adjacent, so not allowed.\\nAvailable: 4-7,5-8,6-9,7-10,8-11, and 9-12 is invalid, 10-13 invalid.\\n4-7: seats 4,5,6,7\\n5-8:5,6,7,8\\n6-9:6,7,8,9\\n7-10:7,8,9,10\\n8-11:8,9,10,11\\n9-12:9,10,11,12 — but 12 is adjacent to 1, so if we place men there, seat 12 is adjacent to seat 1 (man), so the blocks would be adjacent if no woman between, but seat 12 and 1 are adjacent, so if both men, and no woman between in the circle, but in this case, if men at 1,2 and at 9,10,11,12, then seats 12 and 1 are both men and adjacent, so the blocks are connected, forming one big block of size 6.\\nTo prevent that, we need that the second block does not include a seat adjacent to the first block.\\nSeat 12 is adjacent to seat 1, so if the second block includes 12, and first block includes 1, then 12 and 1 are adjacent, so the men are connected.\\nSimilarly, if second block includes seat 3, and first block includes 2, then 2 and 3 adjacent.\\nSo to have two separate blocks, the second block must not include seat 3 or seat 12.\\nIn the arc 3 to 12, exclude 3 and 12, so seats 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 — 8 seats.\\nPlace a block of 4 consecutive men: possible: 4-7,5-8,6-9,7-10,8-11. 9-12 includes 12, not allowed. 3-6 includes 3, not allowed. So only 4-7,5-8,6-9,7-10,8-11. That's 5 ways? But I said 6.\\n4-7,5-8,6-9,7-10,8-11 — that's 5.\\nBut earlier calculation gave 6.\\nMistake.\\nL' = 11−s =11−2=9, t=4, L'−t+1=9−4+1=6, but we have only 5.\\nWhy?\\nSeats available for the block: must be within 4 to 11 inclusive, and size 4, so starting seat from 4 to 8: 4,5,6,7,8.\\nStart at 4: 4,5,6,7\\n5:5,6,7,8\\n6:6,7,8,9\\n7:7,8,9,10\\n8:8,9,10,11\\n9:9,10,11,12 — includes 12, not allowed.\\nSo only 5 ways.\\nBut 8 to 11 is allowed, start at 8.\\nStart at 9 not allowed.\\nSo starts at 4,5,6,7,8 — 5 ways.\\nBut 6 = L'−t+1 =9−4+1=6, but L' is the length of the interval from c+1 to d−1, which is from 4 to 11, size 8, not 9.\\nc = p+s =1+2=3, d=p−1=12 (since p=1, p−1=12), so arc from 3 to 12 inclusive, size 10 seats: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.\\nThen c+1=4, d−1=11, so from 4 to 11 inclusive, size 8 seats.\\nL' = 8.\\nThen L'−t+1 =8−4+1=5, yes.\\nEarlier I said L' =11−s=9, but 11−2=9, but should be (12−s)−2 =10−2=8 for s=2.\\nGeneral: after removing s seats, arc has 12−s seats.\\nThen to have gap, we remove the two end seats (adjacent to the first block), so available for the second block's start is in the interior, but the second block can be placed as long as it doesn't include the end seats, but the number of possible starting positions for the block is the number of positions where the block is contained in the interior arc of size (12−s)−2 =10−s seats? No.\\nThe interior arc has size (12−s) − 2 = 10−s seats? For s=2, 10−2=8, yes.\\nThen number of ways to place a contiguous block of size t=6−s in a line of size L'' = 10−s is max(L''−t+1, 0) if L''≥t.\\nL''−t+1 = (10−s) − (6−s) +1 = 10−s−6+s+1=5.\\nSo always 5 ways, for s=2,3,4.\\nCheck s=2: L''=8, t=4, 8−4+1=5, yes.\\ns=3: L''=10−3=7, t=3, 7−3+1=5.\\ns=4: L''=10−4=6, t=2, 6−2+1=5.\\nGood.\\nSo for each s and each position of the first block, there are 5 ways to place the second men’s block.\\nBut the first block has s possible positions (for size s containing seat 1).\\nSo for each s, number of ways to place the two men’s blocks: s * 5.\\nThen s=2: 2*5=10\\ns=3:3*5=15\\ns=4:4*5=20\\nTotal ways to place the men’s blocks: 10+15+20=45.\\nBut this is just the seat occupation, not who is in them.\\nNow, for each such placement, we need to assign the men to the seats.\\nFirst, the block containing A: size s, A is in it, so we need to assign the other s−1 men in the block from the remaining 5 men.\\nNumber of ways: \\binom{5}{s−1} ways to choose who is in the block with A, then (s−1)! ways to arrange them in the s−1 seats besides A's seat, but A is fixed at 1, so the other s−1 seats in the block can be filled with the chosen men in (s−1)! ways.\\nThen, the other men’s block has size t=6−s, with the remaining 6−s men, who can be arranged in (6−s)! ways.\\nSo for each s, and each block placement, number of ways to assign men: \\binom{5}{s−1} * (s−1)! * (6−s)! = 5! / (5−(s−1))! * (6−s)! / (6−s)! wait.\\n\\binom{5}{s−1} * (s−1)! = P(5, s−1) = 5! / (5−s+1)! \\nThen times (6−s)! for the other block.\\nSo total for men assignment: [5! / (6−s)! ] * (6−s)! = 5! = 120.\\n\\binom{5}{s−1} * (s−1)! = \\frac{5!}{(s−1)! (5−s+1)!} * (s−1)! = \\frac{5!}{(6−s)!}\\nThen times (6−s)! for arranging the other block, so indeed 5! = 120.\\nSo for each way to place the blocks, there are 120 ways to assign the men.\\nAnd there are 45 ways to place the blocks (as above), so total for men: 45 * 120 = 5400.\\nBut this is for the men's seating with A fixed.\\nNow, for the women.\\nWe need to assign the women with the adjacency constraints.\\nIn this configuration, the boundary men are those at the ends of the blocks.\\nEach men’s block of size s has 2 boundary men (the two ends), who are adjacent to women.\\nSimilarly for women’s blocks.\\nTotal boundary men: 2 per block * 2 blocks = 4.\\nThese 4 men are each adjacent to one woman (at the interface), so that woman must be their wife.\\nSimilarly, there are 4 boundary women, each adjacent to one man, who must be their husband.\\nMoreover, the interior men (6-4=2) are not adjacent to any woman, so their wives must not be adjacent to any man, so must be interior women.\\nSimilarly, interior women: 6-4=2, must be married to interior men.\\nNow, for a given block placement and men assignment, we can determine who the boundary men are and where they are.\\nThen, for each boundary man, the woman he is adjacent to must be his wife, and she must be at that seat.\\nSimilarly, for the interior, the wives of interior men must be interior women, but since the interior women are not yet assigned, and no adjacency constraints beyond that, we can assign them.\\nBut let's see.\\nFirst, for the boundary.\\nEach boundary man is adjacent to one specific woman's seat.\\nFor example, take a men’s block from seat a to a+s−1.\\nThen the man at a is adjacent to seat a−1 (which is a woman's seat), and the man at a+s−1 is adjacent to seat a+s (woman's seat).\\nSimilarly for the other block.\\nSo for each boundary man, there is a specific seat where his wife must be.\\nMoreover, that seat is in the women’s block adjacent to that end.\\nNow, since the women’s blocks are determined by the men’s blocks, and the seats are fixed, we can identify the seats.\\nFor example, suppose men’s blocks at (1,2) and (5,6,7,8) — but earlier we have to have gap, so say men at (1,2) and (6,7,8,9) for s=2, t=4.\\nThen seats: 1:M,2:M,3:W,4:W,5:W,6:M,7:M,8:M,9:M,10:W,11:W,12:W\\nWomen’s blocks: (3,4,5) and (10,11,12)\\nBoundary men: at 2 and 1 for first block? Man at 1: adjacent to 12 and 2; 2 is man, 12 is woman, so adjacent to woman at 12.\\nMan at 2: adjacent to 1 (man) and 3 (woman), so adjacent to woman at 3.\\nMan at 6: adjacent to 5 and 7; 7 is man, 5 is woman, so woman at 5.\\nMan at 9: adjacent to 8 (man) and 10 (woman), so woman at 10.\\nSo boundary men: 1,2,6,9\\nAdjacent to women at 12,3,5,10 respectively.\\nSo wife of man at 1 must be at 12\\nWife of man at 2 at 3\\nWife of man at 6 at 5\\nWife of man at 9 at 10\\nNow, the women’s seats are 3,4,5,10,11,12\\nSo seats 3,5,10,12 are assigned to specific women.\\nSeats 4 and 11 are interior women's seats.\\nNow, the interior men are those not boundary: in this case, man at 7 and 8 (since block size 4, ends are 6 and 9, so 7 and 8 are interior).\\nTheir wives must be the interior women, at seats 4 and 11.\\nSo we need to assign the wives of man 7 and man 8 to seats 4 and 11.\\nNumber of ways: 2! = 2, since assign which wife to which seat.\\nBut also, the women at the boundary are determined: wife of man 1 at 12, etc.\\nSo once the men are assigned, the boundary women's seats are determined, so those women are fixed.\\nThen the two interior women's seats are for the two wives of the interior men, and we can assign them in 2! = 2 ways.\\nNow, is this always the case?\\nIn general, for any such configuration, there are 4 boundary men, each requiring their wife at a specific adjacent seat.\\nThere are 4 such seats identified.\\nThen 2 interior men, whose wives must be at the 2 interior women's seats.\\nThe interior women's seats are the ones not adjacent to any man, which in a women’s block of size w, are the internal seats if w>2.\\nIn this case, women’s blocks: one of size 3 (seats 3,4,5), so interior is seat 4.\\nOther of size 3 (10,11,12), interior is 11.\\nSo seats 4 and 11 are interior.\\nYes.\\nNow, are these seats always available and not assigned? Yes, because the boundary women's seats are the end seats of the women’s blocks, while interior are the middle.\\nSo no overlap.\\nMoreover, the number matches: 2 interior women's seats for 2 interior wives.\\nSo for each such arrangement of men, there are 2 ways to assign the women: assign the two interior wives to the two interior seats.\\nNow, this is independent of the block sizes, as long as k=2 and sizes >=2.\\nSo for each way to place the blocks and assign men, there are 2 ways to assign the women.\\nNow, earlier, number of ways to place the blocks: for each s, s choices for first block position, 5 choices for second block position, so s*5 per s.\\nSum over s=2,3,4: 2*5 + 3*5 + 4*5 = 10+15+20=45 ways to place the block positions.\\nThen for each, 120 ways to assign men (as calculated, always 120).\\nThen 2 ways to assign women.\\nSo total for k=2: 45 * 120 * 2 = 45*240 = 10800.\\nBut this is with A fixed at 1.\\nNow, for k=1.\\nk=1: one block of 6 men, one block of 6 women.\\nWith A fixed at 1.\\nThe men’s block is size 6, so it must be 6 consecutive seats including 1.\\nNumber of such blocks: the block can start at seat k for k=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12, but must include 1, and size 6.\\nSo the starting seat can be from 1-5+1= -3? Better: the block occupies 6 consecutive seats including 1.\\nSo the first seat can be from 1-5= -4 to 1, but mod 12.\\nSeats: if start at s, then s to s+5.\\nMust have 1 in [s,s+5], so s ≤ 1 ≤ s+5, so s ≤ 1 and s ≥ 1-5 = -4, so s= -4,-3,-2,-1,0,1, but mod 12, s=8,9,10,11,12,1 (since -4+12=8, etc.)\\ns=8: seats 8,9,10,11,12,1\\ns=9:9,10,11,12,1,2\\ns=10:10,11,12,1,2,3\\ns=11:11,12,1,2,3,4\\ns=12:12,1,2,3,4,5\\ns=1:1,2,3,4,5,6\\nSo 6 possible positions for the men’s block.\\nThen the women’s block is the remaining 6 seats, which will be contiguous since it's a circle and one block removed.\\nFor example, if men at 8-1 and 1, then women at 2,3,4,5,6,7\\nWhich is contiguous.\\nSimilarly for others.\\nSo 6 ways to place the blocks.\\nNow, assign men to the men’s seats.\\nA is fixed at 1.\\nThe men’s block has 6 seats, including 1.\\nRemaining 5 seats to be filled with the other 5 men.\\nNumber of ways: 5! = 120.\\nNow, for women.\\nAs earlier, the two end men are adjacent to women.\\nFor example, if men’s block is s=8: seats 8,9,10,11,12,1\\nThen the block is from 8 to 1, so the ends are seat 8 and seat 1.\\nMan at 8: adjacent to 7 and 9; 9 is man, 7 is woman (since women at 2-7? Seats 2,3,4,5,6,7 are women, so 7 is woman), so adjacent to woman at 7.\\nMan at 1: adjacent to 12 (man) and 2 (woman), so adjacent to woman at 2.\\nSimilarly, the other end: but in a block, the two ends are 8 and 1.\\nMan at 8 adj to 7 (woman), man at 1 adj to 2 (woman).\\nNow, are there other boundary men? No, the others are interior.\\nMan at 9: adj to 8 and 10, both men, so no woman.\\nSimilarly.\\nSo only two boundary men: at 8 and at 1.\\nThey are adjacent to women at 7 and 2 respectively.\\nSo wife of man at 8 must be at 7\\nWife of man at 1 (A) must be at 2\\nNow, the interior men: the other 4 men in seats 9,10,11,12.\\nTheir wives must be interior women.\\nWomen’s block: seats 2,3,4,5,6,7\\nEnds are 2 and 7, interior are 3,4,5,6.\\nSo 4 interior women's seats.\\nWives of the 4 interior men must be at these 4 seats.\\nNumber of ways to assign them: 4! = 24.\\nBut also, the boundary women are determined: wife of A at 2, wife of man at 8 at 7.\\nSo once men are assigned, these two women are fixed.\\nThen the remaining 4 women (wives of the 4 interior men) are assigned to the 4 interior seats in 4! = 24 ways.\\nNow, is this the same for all block positions?\\nCheck another one, say s=1: men at 1,2,3,4,5,6\\nThen ends: man at 1 and man at 6.\\nMan at 1: adj to 12 and 2; 2 is man, 12 is woman (women at 7-12), so adj to woman at 12.\\nMan at 6: adj to 5 (man) and 7 (woman), so adj to woman at 7.\\nSo wife of man at 1 (A) at 12\\nWife of man at 6 at 7\\nInterior men: 2,3,4,5\\nWives at interior women's seats: women’s block 7-12, ends 7 and 12, interior 8,9,10,11.\\nSo assign 4 wives to 4 seats: 4! = 24 ways.\\nGood.\\nNow, for each block position, we have the same: 120 ways for men, 24 ways for women? No, 5! =120 for men, and for women, after fixing the two boundary wives, assign the other 4 wives to the 4 interior seats in 4! =24 ways.\\nBut the number is the same for each block position.\\nNumber of block positions: 6.\\nSo total for k=1: 6 * 120 * 24 = 6*2880 = 17280.\\nBut this is with A fixed.\\nNow, summarize with A fixed at 1:\\n- k=3: 240 ways\\n- k=2: 45 * 120 * 2 = 45*240=10800 ways\\n- k=1: 6 * 120 * 24 = 6*2880=17280 ways\\nTotal: 240 + 10800 + 17280 = let's compute: 240+10800=11040, +17280=28320.\\nBut is that all?\\nWe have covered all k=1,2,3.\\nBut in k=3, we have 240, k=2 10800, k=1 17280, sum 28320.\\nBut this is with one person fixed, so it should be the total number of distinct arrangements up to rotation.\\nBut let me verify with a smaller case or something.\\nAnother way to think: total should be divisible by 12 or something, but we fixed one person, so it's absolute.\\nBut let's see if this makes sense.\\nWe forgot that in k=3, we have two types, but we included both.\\nNow, but in the beginning, for k=3, we got 240, which seems reasonable.\\nBut let's recall that in k=3, with the assignment, women were completely determined, no choice.\\nIn k=2, we had 2 choices for the interior wives.\\nIn k=1, 24 choices.\\nNow, total 28320.\\nBut is this the final answer? Almost, but we need to make sure that in all cases, the conditions are satisfied.\\nIn particular, for the interior people, since they are not adjacent to anyone of opposite sex, the conditions are vacuously satisfied.\\nFor boundary, we ensured that the adjacent opposite-sex person is their spouse.\\nAlso, no one is adjacent to two opposite-sex people, because in the blocks, the end people are adjacent to one same-sex and one opposite-sex, and interior to two same-sex.\\nSo maximum one opposite-sex neighbor, so the only constraint is that that one is their spouse, which we enforced.\\nSo all good.\\nNow, but wait, in k=1, when the men’s block is placed, for example at s=8: seats 8,9,10,11,12,1\\nThen man at 1 is at seat 1, man at 8 at seat 8.\\nThey are not adjacent; in fact, in the block, 8-9-10-11-12-1, so 12 and 1 are adjacent, 8 and 9, etc., so it's contiguous.\\nAdjacencies are fine.\\nNow, total with A fixed: 28320.\\nBut this is the number of ways.\\nBut let's double-check the calculations.\\nFirst, k=3: 240\\nFrom earlier: two configurations, each with 120 men assignments, women determined, so 240, ok.\\nk=2: number of block placements: for each s=2,3,4, s choices for first block, 5 for second, so s*5.\\ns=2:2*5=10\\ns=3:3*5=15\\ns=4:4*5=20\\nSum 45, ok.\\nMen assignment: for each, 120 ways, as calculated.\\nWomen: 2 ways (assign the two interior wives to the two interior seats).\\nSo 45 * 120 * 2 = 45*240=10800, ok.\\nk=1: 6 block positions.\\nMen: 5! =120 ways (since A fixed at 1, other 5 men in other 5 seats).\\nWomen: after fixing the two boundary wives (wife of A and wife of the other end man), assign the remaining 4 wives to the 4 interior women's seats in 4! =24 ways.\\nSo 6 * 120 * 24 = 6*2880=17280, ok.\\nSum: 240 + 10800 = 11040; 11040 + 17280 = 28320.\\nSo total number of distinct seating arrangements is 28320.\\nBut is this correct? We might have missed that in k=2 and k=1, the women's block sizes affect, but we think we covered.\\nAnother thing: in k=1, when we place the men’s block, and it includes seat 1, and we have 6 positions, but are they all distinct under rotation? No, because we fixed A at 1, so different positions are different.\\nFor example, men from 1-6 or from 8-1, etc., are different because the relative positions are different.\\nSo yes.\\nNow, but let's confirm the answer.\\nI recall that in some similar problems, the answer might be different, but let's proceed.\\nSo for Problem 1, answer is 28320.\\nBut let's write it as boxed.\\nBut we have another problem.\\nFirst, let's finish.\\nSo answer for Problem 1 is 28320.\\nNow, Problem 2: Find the value of \\frac{1}{3^{2}+1} + \\frac{1}{4^{2}+2} + \\frac{1}{5^{2}+3} + \\cdots\\nLook at the series: \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2 + (n-2)} ? Let's see.\\nFirst term: n=3, \\frac{1}{3^2 +1} = \\frac{1}{9+1}=1/10\\nThe denominator: for first term, 3^2 +1 =9+1=10\\nSecond: 4^2 +2=16+2=18\\nThird:5^2 +3=25+3=28\\nSo it seems \\frac{1}{n^2 + (n-2)} for n starting from 3.\\nn-2 when n=3 is 1, yes; n=4,2; n=5,3, yes.\\nSo \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2 + n - 2}\\nn^2 + (n-2) = n^2 + n - 2.\\nYes.\\nNow, n^2 + n - 2 = (n+2)(n-1)? Let's factor.\\nn^2 + n - 2 = (n+2)(n-1) = n^2 +2n -n -2 = n^2 +n -2, yes!\\nSo \\frac{1}{n^2 + n - 2} = \\frac{1}{(n+2)(n-1)}\\nNow, partial fractions.\\nLet \\frac{1}{(n+2)(n-1)} = \\frac{a}{n-1} + \\frac{b}{n+2}\\nMultiply: a(n+2) + b(n-1) = 1\\nSet n=1: a(1+2) + b(0) =1 => 3a=1 => a=1/3\\nSet n=-2: a(0) + b(-2-1)=1 => b(-3)=1 => b=-1/3\\nSo \\frac{1}{(n+2)(n-1)} = \\frac{1/3}{n-1} - \\frac{1/3}{n+2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{1}{n-1} - \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right)\\nSo the series is \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{1}{n-1} - \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{n-1} - \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right)\\nLet k = n-1, then when n=3, k=2, n→∞, k→∞\\nSo \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{k} - \\frac{1}{k+3} \\right)\\nThis is a telescoping series.\\nWrite out the terms:\\nFor k=2: \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{5}\\nk=3: \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{6}\\nk=4: \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{7}\\nk=5: \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{8}\\nk=6: \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{9}\\nk=7: \\frac{1}{7} - \\frac{1}{10}\\nand so on.\\nNow, sum: \\frac{1}{3} [ (\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\cdots) - (\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\cdots) ]\\nThe negative terms start from \\frac{1}{5}, while positive from \\frac{1}{2}.\\nSo the sum is \\frac{1}{3} [ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\sum_{m=5}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{m} - \\sum_{m=5}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{m} ] = \\frac{1}{3} [ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} ]\\nSince the infinite tails cancel.\\nSo = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{6}{12} + \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{13}{12} \\right) = \\frac{13}{36}\\nCompute: \\frac{1}{2} = 6/12, \\frac{1}{3}=4/12, \\frac{1}{4}=3/12, sum 13/12, yes.\\nThen \\frac{1}{3} * \\frac{13}{12} = 13/36.\\nSo the sum is \\frac{13}{36}.\\nNow, back to Problem 1.\\nWe have 28320, but is this correct?\\nI recall that in some sources, this problem might have a different answer, but let's see.\\nAnother way: perhaps we double-counted or something.\\nIn k=1, when we have the men’s block, and we placed it in 6 ways, but since the block is symmetric, but we have fixed A at 1, so it's fine.\\nTotal number should be integer, 28320 is integer.\\nPerhaps the answer is 28320.\\nBut let's box it.\\nSo for Problem 1: 28320\\nProblem 2: 13/36\\nNow, in JSON.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"28320\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"13/36\"\n}",
