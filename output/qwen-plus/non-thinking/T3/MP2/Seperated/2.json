Then the congruences become:\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n3a + 5b &\\\\equiv 19 \\\\pmod{m} \\\\\\\\\\n4a + 2b &\\\\equiv 25 \\\\pmod{m}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\nLet’s treat these as equations over $ \\\\mathbb{Z}_m $. We aim to compute $ 2a + 6b \\\\mod m $? But actually, we are to find the value of $ 2a + 6b $ as an integer — but wait: since $ n $ is defined as the answer to this problem, and $ n $ appears in the modulus via $ n+1 $, we need to find $ n $ such that consistent $ a, b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ $ exist satisfying the system modulo $ n+1 $, and $ n $ is the final answer. But the question says “Let $ n $ be the answer to this problem”, so $ n $ is what we’re solving for.\\n\\nBut then it asks: “Find $ 2a + 6b $”.\\n\\nWait — this seems circular. The problem says “Let $ n $ be the answer to this problem.” So $ n = \\\\text{answer} $, which is $ 2a + 6b $? Or is $ n $ just some number, and we are to solve for $ n $, which happens to equal the answer?\\n\\nBut then it says “find $ 2a + 6b $”. So likely, $ n = 2a + 6b $. That must be the interpretation.\\n\\nSo let:\\n$$\\nn = 2a + 6b\\n$$\\nThen the modulus is $ n + 1 = 2a + 6b + 1 $.\\n\\nWe are given:\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n3a + 5b &\\\\equiv 19 \\\\pmod{2a + 6b + 1} \\\\\\\\\\n4a + 2b &\\\\equiv 25 \\\\pmod{2a + 6b + 1}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\nLet $ s = 2a + 6b $, so $ m = s + 1 $, and $ n = s $.\\n\\nSo:\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n3a + 5b - 19 &\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{s+1} \\\\\\\\\\n4a + 2b - 25 &\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{s+1}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\nThat means $ s+1 $ divides both $ 3a + 5b - 19 $ and $ 4a + 2b - 25 $.\\n\\nBut $ s = 2a + 6b $, so $ s+1 = 2a + 6b + 1 $.\\n\\nLet’s denote:\\n- $ A = 3a + 5b - 19 $\\n- $ B = 4a + 2b - 25 $\\n\\nThen $ 2a + 6b + 1 \\\\mid \\\\gcd(A, B) $, or at least divides each.\\n\\nBut since $ a, b $ are positive integers, we can try small values of $ a, b $, compute $ s = 2a + 6b $, then check if the two congruences hold modulo $ s+1 $.\\n\\nLet’s define a plan: loop over small $ a, b $, compute $ s = 2a + 6b $, $ m = s+1 $, and check whether:\\n- $ 3a + 5b \\\\equiv 19 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n- $ 4a + 2b \\\\equiv 25 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nSince $ m = 2a + 6b + 1 $, and $ 3a + 5b < m $ only if $ 3a + 5b < 2a + 6b + 1 \\\\Rightarrow a - b < 1 \\\\Rightarrow a \\\\leq b $, but not necessarily. However, if $ 3a + 5b \\\\equiv 19 \\\\pmod{m} $, and $ m > 3a + 5b $, then congruence implies equality: $ 3a + 5b = 19 $. Similarly for the other.\\n\\nBut $ m = 2a + 6b + 1 $, which could be larger or smaller than $ 3a + 5b $.\\n\\nSuppose $ m > \\\\max(3a+5b, 4a+2b) $, then the congruences imply:\\n$$\\n3a + 5b = 19, \\\\quad 4a + 2b = 25\\n$$\\nLet’s solve this system:\\nFrom first equation: $ 3a + 5b = 19 $\\nSecond: $ 4a + 2b = 25 \\\\Rightarrow 2a + b = 12.5 $ → not integer. Wait, $ 4a + 2b = 25 $ is odd, left side even? $ 4a $ even, $ 2b $ even, sum even, but 25 is odd → impossible.\\n\\nContradiction! So $ 4a + 2b $ is always even, but 25 is odd → so $ 4a + 2b \\\\equiv 25 \\\\pmod{m} $ cannot hold if $ m $ is even? No: modulo arithmetic allows this if $ m $ is odd, because parity isn't preserved in mod unless modulus is 2.\\n\\nBut $ 4a + 2b $ is even, 25 is odd. Their difference is odd. So $ 4a + 2b - 25 $ is odd. Therefore, $ m = s+1 = 2a + 6b + 1 $ must divide an odd number, so $ m $ must be odd. Indeed, $ 2a + 6b $ is even, so $ m = \\\\text{even} + 1 = \\\\text{odd} $, so possible.\\n\\nBut $ 4a + 2b $ is even, 25 is odd, so $ 4a + 2b - 25 $ is odd, and $ m $ divides it, so $ m $ must be odd — which it is.\\n\\nBack to trying small values.\\n\\nLet me assume that $ 3a + 5b - 19 $ is divisible by $ 2a + 6b + 1 $, and same for the other.\\n\\nLet’s eliminate variables.\\n\\nLet $ x = a $, $ y = b $.\\n\\nLet $ m = 2x + 6y + 1 $\\nWe have:\\n$$\\n3x + 5y \\\\equiv 19 \\\\pmod{m}, \\\\quad 4x + 2y \\\\equiv 25 \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\nWhich means:\\n$$\\nm \\\\mid (3x + 5y - 19), \\\\quad m \\\\mid (4x + 2y - 25)\\n$$\\nSo $ m $ divides any linear combination.\\n\\nLet’s form a combination to eliminate one variable.\\n\\nMultiply first congruence by 4: $ 12x + 20y \\\\equiv 76 \\\\pmod{m} $\\nMultiply second by 3: $ 12x + 6y \\\\equiv 75 \\\\pmod{m} $\\nSubtract: $ (12x + 20y) - (12x + 6y) = 14y \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $\\nSo:\\n$$\\n14y \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\nSimilarly, eliminate $ x $:\\nFirst equation ×2: $ 6x + 10y \\\\equiv 38 $\\nSecond ×3: $ 12x + 6y \\\\equiv 75 $\\nBetter: use original.\\nEq1: $ 3x + 5y \\\\equiv 19 $\\nEq2: $ 4x + 2y \\\\equiv 25 $\\nMultiply eq1 by 4: $ 12x + 20y \\\\equiv 76 $\\nMultiply eq2 by 3: $ 12x + 6y \\\\equiv 75 $\\nSubtract: $ 14y \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $ → yes.\\n\\nNow eliminate $ y $:\\neq1 ×2: $ 6x + 10y \\\\equiv 38 $\\neq2 ×5: $ 20x + 10y \\\\equiv 125 $\\nSubtract: $ (20x + 10y) - (6x + 10y) = 14x \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m} $\\nSo:\\n$$\\n14x \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\nSo we have:\\n$$\\n14y \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m}, \\\\quad 14x \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\nAnd $ m = 2x + 6y + 1 $\\n\\nFrom $ 14y \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $, this means $ 14y - 1 $ is divisible by $ m $, so $ m \\\\mid (14y - 1) $\\nSimilarly, $ m \\\\mid (14x - 87) $\\nBut $ m = 2x + 6y + 1 $\\nSo $ 2x + 6y + 1 $ divides $ 14y - 1 $\\nAnd also divides $ 14x - 87 $\\n\\nSince $ m \\\\mid 14y - 1 $, and $ m > 0 $, we have $ m \\\\leq |14y - 1| $. But since $ y \\\\geq 1 $, $ 14y - 1 \\\\geq 13 $, and $ m = 2x + 6y + 1 \\\\geq 2(1) + 6(1) + 1 = 9 $\\nBut $ m \\\\leq 14y - 1 $ (since it divides it and is positive)\\nSo:\\n$$\\n2x + 6y + 1 \\\\leq 14y - 1 \\\\Rightarrow 2x \\\\leq 8y - 2 \\\\Rightarrow x \\\\leq 4y - 1\\n$$\\nSimilarly, from $ m \\\\mid 14x - 87 $, so $ m \\\\leq |14x - 87| $\\nBut $ 14x - 87 $ could be negative, so we consider cases.\\n\\nBut since $ m > 0 $, and divides $ 14x - 87 $, then $ |14x - 87| \\\\geq m $ if $ 14x - 87 \\\\neq 0 $\\nBut $ 14x - 87 = 0 \\\\Rightarrow x = 87/14 \\\\approx 6.21 $, not integer, so never zero.\\nSo $ |14x - 87| \\\\geq m = 2x + 6y + 1 $\\n\\nCase 1: $ 14x - 87 \\\\geq 0 \\\\Rightarrow x \\\\geq 7 $ (since 14×6=84<87, 14×7=98>87)\\nThen $ 14x - 87 \\\\geq 2x + 6y + 1 \\\\Rightarrow 12x - 6y \\\\geq 88 \\\\Rightarrow 6x - 3y \\\\geq 44 $\\nCase 2: $ x \\\\leq 6 $, then $ |14x - 87| = 87 - 14x $, so $ 87 - 14x \\\\geq 2x + 6y + 1 \\\\Rightarrow 86 - 16x \\\\geq 6y $\\n\\nAlso from earlier $ x \\\\leq 4y - 1 $\\n\\nTry small $ y $.\\nStart with $ y = 1 $:\\nThen $ x \\\\leq 4(1) - 1 = 3 $\\nAlso $ m = 2x + 6(1) + 1 = 2x + 7 $\\nAnd $ m \\\\mid 14y - 1 = 14 - 1 = 13 $\\nSo $ m \\\\mid 13 $, $ m = 2x + 7 $, and $ m $ divides 13, so $ m = 1, 13 $ (positive divisors)\\n$ m = 1 $: $ 2x + 7 = 1 \\\\Rightarrow x = -3 $ invalid\\n$ m = 13 $: $ 2x + 7 = 13 \\\\Rightarrow 2x = 6 \\\\Rightarrow x = 3 $\\nNow check $ x = 3, y = 1 $\\nCheck $ m = 2(3) + 6(1) + 1 = 6 + 6 + 1 = 13 $, yes\\nNow check the original congruences:\\n$ 3a + 5b = 3(3) + 5(1) = 9 + 5 = 14 $\\n$ 14 \\\\equiv 19 \\\\pmod{13}? 19 - 14 = 5 $, not divisible by 13 → 14 ≡ 1, 19≡6 mod 13, no\\nNot satisfied.\\nBut we also need $ m \\\\mid 14x - 87 = 14*3 - 87 = 42 - 87 = -45 $, and 13 does not divide 45? 45 / 13 ≈ 3.46, no. 13×3=39, 45-39=6, not divisible. So indeed not.\\nBut earlier we had $ m \\\\mid 14y - 1 = 13 $, so m=13 is required, but doesn't satisfy the other condition.\\nSo no for y=1.\\n\\ny=2:\\nThen $ x \\\\leq 4*2 -1 =7 $\\n$ m = 2x + 12 + 1 = 2x + 13 $\\n$ 14y -1 = 28 -1 =27 $\\nSo $ m \\\\mid 27 $, so $ m $ is a positive divisor of 27: 1,3,9,27\\n$ m = 2x + 13 $\\nSet equal:\\n2x+13=1 → x=-6\\n=3→x=-5\\n=9→x=-2\\n=27→2x=14→x=7\\nSo x=7\\nNow check x=7,y=2\\nm=2*7 + 6*2 +1=14+12+1=27, yes\\nNow check 14x -87=14*7 -87=98-87=11\\nDoes 27 divide 11?

Good.\\nSecond: 4a+2b=4*27 +2*7=108+14=122\\n25 mod 97: 122 -25=97, so 122≡25 mod 97? 122 -25=97, yes.\\nPerfect.\\nNow, $ n = 2a + 6b = 2*27 + 6*7 = 54 + 42 = 96 $\\nAnd modulus is n+1=97, which matches.\\nNow, the problem says “let n be the answer to this problem”, and asks to find $ 2a+6b $, which is exactly n.\\nSo answer is 96.\\n\\nIs this the only solution? We assumed $ m = 14y -1 $, but actually $ m $ divides $ 14y -1 $, so could be a proper divisor. In previous trials, we only took the largest divisor, but smaller ones gave negative x. For y=7, divisors of 97 are 1 and 97, m=1 gives x negative. So only one solution.\\nThus $ 2a+6b = 96 $.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nQuadrilateral ABCD with AB=2, BC=3, CD=5, DA=4. Find maximum possible radius of inscribed circle.\\nA circle can be inscribed in a quadrilateral iff the sums of opposite sides are equal: AB + CD = AD + BC?\\nStandard condition: for tangential quadrilateral, sum of opposite sides equal.\\nAB + CD = 2 + 5 = 7\\nAD + BC = 4 + 3 = 7\\nEqual! So it is possible to have an incircle, and in fact, for any such quadrilateral with fixed side lengths where AB+CD=AD+BC, there exists a tangential quadrilateral, and the inradius depends on the area.\\nFor a tangential quadrilateral, area $ A = r \\\\times s $, where $ s $ is the semiperimeter.\\nSemiperimeter $ s = \\\\frac{2+3+5+4}{2} = \\\\frac{14}{2} = 7 $\\nThen $ A = r \\\\cdot 7 $\\nTo maximize $ r $, we need to maximize area $ A $.\\nSo the problem reduces to: among all quadrilaterals with given side lengths AB=2, BC=3, CD=5, DA=4, and satisfying the tangential condition (which is automatically satisfied since sums are equal), what is the maximum possible area?\\nBut not all such quadrilaterals have an incircle; only those that are tangential. But here, since AB+CD=AD+BC, it is possible to have an incircle, but not all configurations do; however, the maximum area occurs when the quadrilateral is cyclic (by Brahmagupta), but for tangential quadrilaterals, the area is maximized when it's also cyclic?\\nActually, for a given set of side lengths with fixed perimeter and satisfying the tangential condition, the area is maximized when the quadrilateral is cyclic.\\nThere is a formula for the area of a tangential quadrilateral: $ A = r \\\\cdot s $, but to maximize A, we need the maximum possible area for such a quadrilateral.\\nThe maximum area of a quadrilateral with given side lengths is achieved when it is cyclic (Brahmagupta's formula), but only if it can be cyclic. But in this case, since the sums of opposite sides are equal, it can be both cyclic and tangential, i.e., a bicentric quadrilateral.\\nAnd for given side lengths, the maximum area is indeed when it's cyclic.\\nSo we can compute the maximum possible area using Brahmagupta's formula, since the quadrilateral can be made cyclic (and still satisfy the tangential condition).\\nBrahmagupta: for cyclic quadrilateral with sides a,b,c,d, area $ \\\\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)} $\\nHere a=2,b=3,c=5,d=4, s=7\\nSo $ A = \\\\sqrt{(7-2)(7-3)(7-5)(7-4)} = \\\\sqrt{5 \\\\cdot 4 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 3} = \\\\sqrt{120} = 2\\\\sqrt{30} $\\nThen since $ A = r s = 7r $, so $ 7r = 2\\\\sqrt{30} \\\\Rightarrow r = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{30}}{7} $\\nBut is this achievable? Only if the quadrilateral is both cyclic and tangential. With these side lengths, since AB+CD=AD+BC, it is possible to have an incircle, and it can also be cyclic. The existence of a bicentric quadrilateral with given side lengths requires additional conditions, but in this case, since the area computed is positive and the side lengths satisfy the tangential condition, and Brahmagupta gives a real area, it should be possible.\\nMoreover, for four given side lengths with equal opposite sums, there exists a bicentric quadrilateral if the area from Brahmagupta is large enough, but I think in this case it works.\\nAlternatively, the maximum area under the constraint of having an incircle might be less than the cyclic area, but actually, for fixed side lengths and tangential, the area is maximized when cyclic.\\nI recall that among all tangential quadrilaterals with given side lengths, the cyclic one has the maximum area.\\nYes, that's a known result.\\nTherefore, the maximum area is $ \\\\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)} = \\\\sqrt{5 \\\\cdot 4 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 3} = \\\\sqrt{120} = 2\\\\sqrt{30} $\\nThen $ A = r s \\\\Rightarrow 2\\\\sqrt{30} = r \\\\cdot 7 \\\\Rightarrow r = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{30}}{7} $\\nSo the maximum possible inradius is $ \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{30}}{7} $\\nBut let me confirm the calculation:\\ns-a=7-2=5\\ns-b=7-3=4\\ns-c=7-5=2\\ns-d=7-4=3\\nProduct: 5*4=20, 2*3=6, 20*6=120, sqrt(120)=√(4*30)=2√30, yes.\\ns=7, so r=A/s=2√30 / 7\\nSo answer is $ \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{30}}{7} $\\nBut the problem asks for the maximum possible radius, and we assumed it can be achieved when cyclic, which should be fine.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"96\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\\\\sqrt{30}/7\"\n}",
