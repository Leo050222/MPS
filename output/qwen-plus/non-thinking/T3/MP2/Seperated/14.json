Note that squares mod 3 are 0 or 1.\\n\\nLeft-hand side (LHS): a² + b² + 16c² ≡ a² + b² + c² (mod 3), since 16 ≡ 1 mod 3.\\nSo LHS ≡ a² + b² + c² mod 3.\\n\\nRight-hand side (RHS): 9k² + 1 ≡ 0 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 3.\\nSo we need:\\na² + b² + c² ≡ 1 mod 3.\\n\\nNow, primes > 3 are ≡ ±1 mod 3, so their squares ≡ 1 mod 3.\\nPrime 3 has square 0 mod 3.\\nPrime 2 has 2² = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3.\\nSo for any prime p ≠ 3, p² ≡ 1 mod 3; if p = 3, p² ≡ 0.\\n\\nSo a², b², c² each are either 0 or 1 mod 3.\\nTheir sum ≡ 1 mod 3 ⇒ number of primes among a,b,c equal to 3 must be such that the total sum of squares mod 3 is 1.\\nLet x = number of variables among a,b,c equal to 3 (so their square ≡ 0).\\nThen the other (3−x) have square ≡ 1, so sum ≡ 3−x mod 3.\\nWe want 3−x ≡ 1 mod 3 ⇒ −x ≡ 1 mod 3 ⇒ x ≡ 2 mod 3.\\nSince x ∈ {0,1,2,3}, only possibility is x=2.\\nThus exactly two of a,b,c are equal to 3.\\n\\nCase analysis:\\nSubcases based on which two of a,b,c are 3.\\n\\nCase 1: a = 3, b = 3, c arbitrary prime.\\nThen equation becomes:\\n3² + 3² + 16c² = 9k² + 1 → 9 + 9 + 16c² = 9k² + 1 → 18 + 16c² = 9k² + 1 →\\n16c² + 17 = 9k².\\nSo 9k² − 16c² = 17.\\nThis is a difference of squares: (3k)² − (4c)² = 17 → (3k − 4c)(3k + 4c) = 17.\\n17 is prime, so factor pairs: (1,17), (−1,−17). Since k,c positive, take positive: 3k−4c=1, 3k+4c=17.\\nAdd: 6k = 18 → k=3. Then from first: 9 − 4c =1 → 4c=8 → c=2.\\nc=2 is prime. So solution: a=3,b=3,c=2,k=3.\\nCheck: 9+9+16*4=18+64=82. RHS: 9*9+1=81+1=82. Yes.\\n\\nNow check permutations: we assumed a=3,b=3. But since a and b are symmetric in the equation, same result if a=3,b=3. What if other pairs?\\n\\nCase 2: a=3, c=3, b arbitrary prime.\\nThen: a=3, c=3 → a² + b² + 16c² = 9 + b² + 16*9 = 9 + b² + 144 = b² + 153.\\nRHS: 9k² +1.\\nSo b² + 153 = 9k² +1 → 9k² − b² = 152 → (3k − b)(3k + b) = 152.\\nNow b is prime. Let d = 3k−b, e=3k+b, d<e, d*e=152, e−d = 2b.\\nFactor pairs of 152: (1,152), (2,76), (4,38), (8,19).\\nAlso negative, but skip since k,b positive.\\nTry each:\\n(1,152): e−d=151=2b → b=75.5, not integer.\\n(2,76): 74=2b → b=37, prime.\\nThen 3k − b =2, 3k + b=76. Add: 6k=78 → k=13.\\nCheck: b=37, k=13. Now compute LHS: a=3, b=37, c=3 → 9 + 1369 + 16*9 = 9+1369+144=1522.\\nRHS: 9*(169)+1=1521+1=1522. Yes! So another solution: a=3,b=37,c=3,k=13.\\nBut wait: we required exactly two of a,b,c to be 3. Here a=3, c=3, b=37≠3, so yes.\\n\\nSimilarly, could have b=3, c=3, a arbitrary.\\nBy symmetry of a and b, we'll get same with a and b swapped.\\n\\nSo Case 3: b=3, c=3, a arbitrary.\\nThen: a² + 9 + 144 = a² + 153 = 9k² +1 → 9k² − a² =152 → same as above.\\nSo (3k−a)(3k+a)=152.\\nSame factor pairs.\\n(2,76): 3k−a=2, 3k+a=76 → 6k=78→k=13, a=37.\\nSo a=37,b=3,c=3,k=13.\\n\\nNow, are there more factor pairs? We had (4,38): e−d=34=2b → b=17, prime.\\nThen 3k−b=4, 3k+b=38 → add: 6k=42→k=7.\\nThen b= (38−4)/2? Wait: from e−d=2b → b=17. Then 3k = (d+e)/2 = (4+38)/2=21 → k=7.\\nCheck: if in case a=3,c=3,b=17: LHS: 9 + 289 + 144 = 442. RHS: 9*49 +1=441+1=442. Yes!\\nSimilarly, in case b=3,c=3,a=17: same thing.\\nAnd in case a=3,b=3,c=? no, this is different case.\\nWait: this is for when one of a or b is free.\\nSo for (4,38): gives b=17 or a=17 depending on case.\\nSimilarly, (8,19): e−d=11=2b → b=5.5, not integer.\\n(1,152): already did, not integer.\\nWhat about (19,8)? But then d>e, but we assumed d<e, so skip.\\nAlso negative: (−1,−152): e−d = −151, 2b=−151, b negative, invalid.\\nSo only (2,76) and (4,38) give integer b.\\n(4,38): b=17, k=7.\\nNow check if primes: yes.\\nSo solutions:\\n- a=3,b=3,c=2,k=3\\n- a=3,b=37,c=3,k=13\\n- a=3,b=17,c=3,k=7\\n- a=37,b=3,c=3,k=13\\n- a=17,b=3,c=3,k=7\\n\\nBut earlier we said exactly two of a,b,c must be 3. In first solution, a=3,b=3,c=2≠3: yes. Others: a=3,c=3,b≠3: yes.\\nIs there a case where b=3,c=3,a≠3? We did that: gives a=37 or 17.\\nBut what about a=3,b=3,c= something else? Earlier we only got c=2.\\nIn case a=3,b=3: we had 16c² +17 =9k² → 9k²−16c²=17 → only solution from factoring 17: (1,17) giving c=2,k=3.\\nAre there others? 17 is prime, so only ±1,±17. Negative: 3k−4c=−17, 3k+4c=−1: then 6k=−18→k=−3 invalid.\\nOr 3k−4c=−1, 3k+4c=−17: 6k=−18→k=−3 invalid.\\nSo only one solution in this subcase: c=2.\\n\\nNow, are there cases where c=3 and one of a or b is 3, but we already covered.\\nBut in the sum a²+b²+c² ≡1 mod 3, we concluded exactly two of a,b,c are 3.\\nBut what if one of them is 3, but others include 3? No, we said exactly two.\\nBut let's verify: if all three are 3: sum of squares mod 3: 0+0+0=0 ≢1.\\nIf one is 3: then two squares ≡1, sum≡2≢1.\\nIf none is 3: sum≡3≡0≢1.\\nOnly if two are 3: sum≡1≡1. Correct.\\nSo only possibilities are the ones we considered.\\n\\nBut in the cases where c=3 and a=3, b arbitrary, we found b=37 and b=17.\\nSimilarly when c=3 and b=3, a=37 or 17.\\nAnd when a=3,b=3, c=2.\\n\\nBut is c=2 allowed? c is prime, yes.\\nNow, are there any other factor pairs? 152 also has (8,19), but e−d=11, 2b=11, b=5.5 not integer.\\n(19,8) would give negative b.\\nWhat about (−2,−76)? Then e−d = −74 = 2b → b=−37, invalid.\\nSo only two solutions for the 9k²−b²=152: b=37,k=13 and b=17,k=7.\\n\\nBut in the first case, when a=b=3, we have one solution.\\nNow, list all solutions:\\n1. a=3,b=3,c=2,k=3\\n2. a=3,b=37,c=3,k=13\\n3. a=3,b=17,c=3,k=7\\n4. a=37,b=3,c=3,k=13\\n5. a=17,b=3,c=3,k=7\\n\\nBut note: in solution 2 and 4, it's symmetric in a and b, so both are valid since a and b are distinct variables.\\nSimilarly for 3 and 5.\\nIs there a solution where c=3 and a=3, but b=3? That would be all three 3, but then LHS: 9+9+144=162, RHS: 9k²+1=162 → 9k²=161, not integer. And also violates the mod 3 condition since three 3s.\\nSo no.\\n\\nBut in solution 1, c=2, which is fine.\\nNow, are there any constraints we missed? The problem asks for all prime numbers a,b,c and positive integers k.\\nSo these are all solutions.\\nBut perhaps we should check if there are more.\\nAnother thought: in the case where a=3,c=3, we solved 9k²−b²=152, and found b=17,37.\\nBut b must be prime, which they are.\\nSimilarly.\\nNow, is there a case where b=3,c=3, and a=2? For example, but in that case, from symmetry, when we set b=3,c=3, we solve for a, and we got a=17 or 37, not 2.\\nIf a=2,b=3,c=3: LHS: 4+9+144=157. RHS: 9k²+1=157 → 9k²=156 → k²=156/9=52/3, not integer.\\nSo no.\\nSimilarly, other combinations.\\nSo only the five solutions above.\\nBut let me write them clearly:\\n- (a,b,c,k) = (3,3,2,3)\\n- (3,37,3,13)\\n- (3,17,3,7)\\n- (37,3,3,13)\\n- (17,3,3,7)\\n\\nNote that (3,3,2,3) is symmetric in a and b, but since a and b both 3, it's the same.\\nNo duplicate.\\nSo five solutions.\\nBut the problem says \\\"find all\\\", so we need to list them.\\nBut perhaps they consider ordered triples, so all are distinct.\\nYes.\\n\\nBut wait: in the first solution, c=2, while in others c=3.\\nAll satisfy.\\n\\nNow, Problem 2: Find the smallest n such that n! ends in 290 zeroes.\\n\\nThe number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is min of powers of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more 2s than 5s, it's the exponent of 5 in n!.\\nWhich is given by floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + floor(n/625) + ... \\nWe need this sum to be exactly 290.\\nBut the question is to find the smallest n such that n! has at least 290 trailing zeros? No: \\\"ends in 290 zeroes\\\" means exactly 290? Or at least 290?\\nTypically, such problems ask for the smallest n such that n! has at least that many trailing zeros. But it says \\\"ends in 290 zeroes\\\", which might imply exactly 290, but that may not be possible, and usually it's interpreted as at least 290.\\nBut let's read: \\\"the smallest n such that n! ends in 290 zeroes\\\".\\nIf it ends in exactly 290 zeroes, then for some n it might jump over, but actually the number of trailing zeros increases, but not strictly: it stays constant between multiples of 5, but jumps at multiples of 5.\\nActually, the function z(n) = number of trailing zeros in n! is non-decreasing, and increases only when n is a multiple of 5, and the increase is by the multiplicity of 5 in n.\\nSo it can jump by more than 1.\\nFor example, at n=25, z(24)=floor(24/5)=4, z(25)=floor(25/5)+floor(25/25)=5+1=6, so jumps from 4 to 6, skipping 5.\\nSo it's possible that 290 is skipped, meaning no n! has exactly 290 trailing zeros.\\nBut the problem likely means at least 290, as is standard.\\nMoreover, it asks for the smallest n, implying the first time it reaches or exceeds 290.\\nSo we need the smallest n such that z(n) >= 290.\\n\\nSo compute z(n) = sum_{k=1}^infty floor(n / 5^k)\\nWe need z(n) >= 290.\\nWe can estimate n.\\nSince z(n) ≈ n/4, because each term contributes roughly n/5, n/25, etc., sum is n/(5-1) = n/4.\\nMore precisely, sum_{k=1}^infty n / 5^k = n/5 / (1-1/5) = (n/5)/(4/5) = n/4.\\nSo n ≈ 4 * 290 = 1160.\\nBut since floor functions, a bit higher.\\nTry n=1160.\\nz(1160) = floor(1160/5) + floor(1160/25) + floor(1160/125) + floor(1160/625) + floor(1160/3125) + ...\\nCompute:\\n1160 / 5 = 232\\n1160 / 25 = 46.4 → 46\\n1160 / 125 = 9.28 → 9\\n1160 / 625 = 1.856 → 1\\n1160 / 3125 = 0.3712 → 0\\nHigher powers 0.\\nSum: 232 + 46 = 278; 278 + 9 = 287; 287 + 1 = 288 < 290.\\n288 < 290, so too small.\\nNeed larger n.\\nNow try n=1170.\\n1170/5=234\\n1170/25=46.8→46\\n1170/125=9.36→9\\n1170/625=1.872→1\\nSum: 234+46=280; 280+9=289; 289+1=290. Exactly 290.\\nSo z(1170)=290.\\nNow, is this the smallest? Check n=1169.\\nBut z(n) increases only when n is multiple of 5, since otherwise no additional factor of 5.\\nFrom n=1165 to 1169, z(n) same as z(1165)?\\nActually, z(n) is constant between multiples of 5, but changes at multiples of 5.\\nSpecifically, z(n) = z(n-1) if n not divisible by 5, and increases by the exponent of 5 in n if divisible by 5.\\nSo we need to check the last multiple of 5 before 1170, which is 1165.\\nCompute z(1165):\\n1165/5=233\\n1165/25=46.6→46\\n1165/125=9.32→9\\n1165/625=1.864→1\\nSum: 233+46=279; 279+9=288; 288+1=289 < 290.\\nSo z(1165)=289.\\nThen z(1166)=z(1167)=z(1168)=z(1169)=289.\\nThen z(1170): since 1170 divisible by 5, and 1170 / 5 = 234, but exponent of 5 in 1170.\\n1170 ÷ 5 = 234, 234 not divisible by 5, so exponent is 1.\\nThus z(1170) = z(1169) + 1 = 289 + 1 = 290.\\nYes.\\nSo at n=1170, it reaches 290.\\nAnd since z(1169)=289<290, so 1170 is the smallest such n.\\nBut earlier I computed directly: 234+46+9+1=290, yes.\\nSo answer is 1170.\\n\\nBut confirm: is there any n<1170 with z(n)>=290? z(1169)=289<290, and lower n have less or equal, so no.\\nThus smallest n is 1170.\\n\\nNow back to Problem 1: we have five solutions.\\nBut the problem says \\\"find all prime numbers a,b,c and positive integers k\\\", so probably list all ordered triples (a,b,c,k).\\nBut in the answer format, we need to put in a single string or something.\\nPerhaps list them as sets or something.\\nBut since it's multiple answers, maybe describe.\\nLooking at the JSON format, answer_1 should be a string.\\nSo perhaps write the solutions.\\nSince it's a math competition style, perhaps they expect to list the possibilities.\\nNotice that in all solutions, two of the primes are 3, and the third is 2,17, or 37.\\nSpecifically:\\n- When c=2, a=b=3\\n- When c=3, then {a,b} = {3,17} or {3,37}\\nBut since a and b are symmetric except when both 3.\\nSo the solutions are:\\n(a,b,c,k) = (3,3,2,3), (3,17,3,7), (17,3,3,7), (3,37,3,13), (37,3,3,13)\\n\\nWe can write them as ordered triples.\\nBut for the answer, perhaps list all.\\nSince the problem might expect only distinct up to symmetry, but it doesn't say.\\nGiven that a,b,c are specified, probably ordered.\\nBut in the answer, we need to box the answer.\\nPerhaps write: the solutions are (a,b,c,k) = (3,3,2,3), (3,17,3,7), (17,3,3,7), (3,37,3,13), (37,3,3,13)\\nBut for the JSON, just put that string.\\n\\nAlternatively, since k is determined, but anyway.\\nI think listing them is fine.\\n\\nBut let me confirm if there are more.\\nEarlier when a=3,c=3, we had b=17 or 37.\\nBut is there b= other? We had factor pairs, only those two.\\nSimilarly.\\nAnd when a=b=3, only c=2.\\nBut what if c=3, and a=3, but b=3? Already checked, doesn't work.\\nOr other primes.\\nSuppose c=5, but then from mod 3, we need exactly two of a,b,c to be 3.\\nIf c=5≠3, then a and b must both be 3.\\nSo only possibility is a=3,b=3,c=5.\\nThen LHS: 9+9+16*25=18+400=418.\\nRHS: 9k²+1=418 → 9k²=417 → k²=46.333, not integer.\\nSimilarly, if c=7: 16*49=784, plus 18=802. 9k²=801, k²=89, not square.\\nBut according to mod 3, if c≠3, then a and b must both be 3, so only that case, and we already solved 16c² +17=9k², which only has solution c=2,k=3, as 9k²−16c²=17, which factors as (3k−4c)(3k+4c)=17, prime, so only solutions as before.\\nSo no others.\\nSimilarly, if a≠3, but then to have two 3s, either b and c are 3, or a and c, etc., but we covered all cases.\\nSo only five solutions.\\n\\nNow for the answer.\\n\\nProblem 2 is clear: 1170.\\n\\nSo final answers.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"(a,b,c,k) = (3,3,2,3), (3,17,3,7), (17,3,3,7), (3,37,3,13), (37,3,3,13)\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1170\"\n}",
