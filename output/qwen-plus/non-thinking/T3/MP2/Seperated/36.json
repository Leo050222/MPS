Then the equation becomes:\\ns(s - 1) = n - 1  =>  n = s(s - 1) + 1 = s² - s + 1\\n\\nSo n must equal s² - s + 1, and also S(n) = s.\\n\\nWe now search for values of s such that the digit sum of s² - s + 1 is exactly s.\\n\\nNote: For any number n, we know that S(n) ≡ n mod 9 (digit sum modulo 9).\\nSo s ≡ n mod 9 → s ≡ s² - s + 1 mod 9\\n→ s² - 2s + 1 ≡ 0 mod 9 → (s - 1)² ≡ 0 mod 9 → s ≡ 1 mod 3\\nSo s ≡ 1 mod 3 → s = 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, ...\\n\\nTry small values of s:\\n\\ns = 1: n = 1² - 1 + 1 = 1; S(1) = 1 → works.\\n\\ns = 4: n = 16 - 4 + 1 = 13; S(13) = 1 + 3 = 4 → works.\\n\\ns = 7: n = 49 - 7 + 1 = 43; S(43) = 4 + 3 = 7 → works.\\n\\ns = 10: n = 100 - 10 + 1 = 91; S(91) = 9 + 1 = 10 → works.\\n\\ns = 13: n = 169 - 13 + 1 = 157; S(157) = 1+5+7=13 → works.\\n\\ns = 16: n = 256 - 16 + 1 = 241; S(241)=2+4+1=7 ≠ 16 → no.\\n\\ns = 19: n = 361 - 19 + 1 = 343; S(343)=3+4+3=10 ≠ 19 → no.\\n\\ns = 22: n = 484 - 22 + 1 = 463; S(463)=4+6+3=13 ≠ 22 → no.\\n\\ns = 25: n = 625 - 25 + 1 = 601; S(601)=6+0+1=7 ≠ 25 → no.\\n\\ns = 28: n = 784 - 28 + 1 = 757; S(757)=7+5+7=19 ≠ 28 → no.\\n\\ns = 31: n = 961 - 31 + 1 = 931; S(931)=9+3+1=13 ≠ 31 → no.\\n\\ns = 34: n = 1156 - 34 + 1 = 1123; S(1123)=1+1+2+3=7 ≠ 34 → no.\\n\\nAs s increases, n ≈ s², but digit sum grows at most logarithmically. The maximum digit sum of a d-digit number is 9d, and d ≈ log₁₀(n) ≈ 2 log₁₀(s). So S(n) ≤ 18 log₁₀(s), while s grows linearly. Eventually s > 18 log₁₀(s), so only finitely many solutions.\\n\\nWe already have s = 1,4,7,10,13 working.\\n\\nCheck s = 16 again?

Unlikely.\\n\\nBut let's suppose n has d digits. Then S(n) ≤ 9d, and n ≥ 10^{d-1}.\\nFrom equation: n = s² - s + 1 ≈ s².\\nSo s ≈ √n ≈ √(10^{d-1}) = 10^{(d-1)/2}\\nBut S(n) ≤ 9d\\nSo we need 9d ≥ s ≈ 10^{(d-1)/2}\\nFor d=4: 36 ≥ 10^{1.5}≈31.6 → possible\\nWe checked up to n=1561, which is 4-digit.\\nd=5: 45 ≥ 10^2 = 100? No → 45 < 100 → impossible\\nSo s ≤ 9*5=45, but s ≈ √n ≥ √10000=100 → contradiction\\nWait: n ≈ s², and n has d digits → s ≈ √n ≈ 10^{d/2}\\nAnd S(n) ≤ 9d\\nSo need 9d ≥ s ≈ 10^{d/2}\\nCheck:\\nd=1: 9 ≥ 10^{0.5}≈3.16 → yes\\n... \\nd=4: 36 ≥ 10^2 = 100? No → 36 < 100 → contradiction?\\nWait: n ≈ s², so if d=4, n < 10000 → s < 100\\nS(n) ≤ 36, so s ≤ 36\\nThen n = s² - s + 1 ≤ 36² -36 +1 = 1296 -36 +1=1261 → 4-digit max → consistent\\nBut for d=5: n ≥ 10000 → s² ≈ n → s ≥ 100\\nBut S(n) ≤ 9*5=45 < 100 → s ≤ 45 < 100 → contradiction\\nThus no solutions for n ≥ 10000\\nSo s ≤ 45\\nWe checked up to s=40, continue to s=43 (largest ≡1 mod 3 under 45)\\n\\ns=40: not ≡1 mod 3 → skip\\ns=41: 41 mod 3 = 2 → skip\\ns=42: 0 → skip\\ns=43: 43≡1 mod 3 → try\\nn = 43² -43 +1 = 1849 -43 +1 = 1807\\nS(1807)=1+8+0+7=16 ≠43 → no\\n\\ns=46>45? Wait s≤45 from above logic? s≥100 for 5-digit n, but s≤45 from digit sum → no 5-digit solutions\\nBut s=43 gives n=1807<10000 → 4-digit, allowed\\nBut didn't work\\n\\ns=13 was last good one\\n\\nSo candidates: s=1,4,7,10,13 → n=1,13,43,91,157\\n\\nVerify each:\\nn=1: S(n)=1; 1*(1-1)=0; n-1=0 → 0=0 ✓\\nn=13: S=4; 4*3=12; n-1=12 ✓\\nn=43: S=7; 7*6=42; 43-1=42 ✓\\nn=91: S=10; 10*9=90; 91-1=90 ✓\\nn=157: S=13; 13*12=156; 157-1=156 ✓\\n\\nAll work.\\n\\nAre there any others?\\nWhat about s=0? But n positive integer, S(n)≥1 for n≥1. n=1 is smallest.\\n\\nSo solutions: n=1,13,43,91,157\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 1: list all such n.\\n\\nProblem 2: Penta chooses 5 vertices of a unit cube. What is the maximum possible volume of the polyhedron with those 5 vertices?\\n\\nA unit cube has side length 1. Vertices at (x,y,z) where x,y,z ∈ {0,1}\\n\\nWe pick 5 vertices. Want to maximize the volume of the convex hull (since volume is defined for the solid figure formed by the points).\\n\\nThe convex hull of 5 points in 3D can be various things: a polyhedron with triangular or quadrilateral faces.\\n\\nTo maximize volume, we want the 5 points to be as spread out as possible — avoid coplanarity.\\n\\nNote: the entire cube has volume 1. Can we get close to that?\\nBut 5 points — cannot fill the whole cube.\\n\\nIdea: choose 5 vertices that form a pyramid over a quadrilateral base, and maximize the height and base area.\\n\\nBest might be to take a face of the cube (a square) and then the vertex farthest from it.\\n\\nBut a face has 4 vertices. Add the opposite vertex? But in a cube, each vertex has an opposite (antipodal) vertex, distance √3 away.\\n\\nSuppose we take four vertices of one face, say z=0: (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(1,1,0),(0,1,0). This is a square of area 1.\\nAdd a fifth vertex. To maximize volume, we want it as far as possible from this plane (z=0). The farthest is z=1, so any of the top vertices.\\nBut if we add (0,0,1), then the convex hull is a square pyramid with base on z=0 and apex (0,0,1).\\nHeight is 1 (perpendicular distance from apex to base plane).\\nVolume of pyramid = (1/3) * base_area * height = (1/3)*1*1 = 1/3\\n\\nBut is this the maximum?\\n\\nWhat if we don't take a full face? Maybe a non-planar base?\\n\\nAlternative: take a tetrahedron and add a point.\\n\\nMaximum volume simplex in cube is a tetrahedron. The largest tetrahedron in a cube has volume 1/3? Wait.\\nActually, a regular tetrahedron doesn't fit, but we can have a tetrahedron with vertices (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1). Let's compute its volume.\\n\\nVectors from (0,0,0):\\na = (1,1,0), b=(1,0,1), c=(0,1,1)\\nVolume = (1/6)|scalar triple product| = (1/6)|a·(b×c)|\\nb×c = determinant i(j k) for b=(1,0,1), c=(0,1,1)\\ni(0*1 - 1*1) - j(1*1 - 1*0) + k(1*1 - 0*0) = i(-1) - j(1) + k(1) = (-1,-1,1)? Wait:\\ni(0*1 - 1*1) = i(0-1)= -i\\nj component: minus (1*1 - 1*0) = -(1-0)= -1 → +1j? No:\\nb×c = | i     j     k  |\\n      | 1     0     1  |\\n      | 0     1     1  |\\n= i(0*1 - 1*1) - j(1*1 - 1*0) + k(1*1 - 0*0) = i(0-1) - j(1-0) + k(1-0) = -i -j +k = (-1,-1,1)\\nThen a·(-1,-1,1) = (1,1,0)·(-1,-1,1) = -1 -1 + 0 = -2\\n|det| = 2\\nVolume = (1/6)*|det| = 2/6 = 1/3\\nSame as before.\\n\\nBut this is a tetrahedron (4 points). We need 5 points.\\n\\nWith 5 points, we can get more than 1/3?\\n\\nBack to pyramid: we got 1/3 with a square pyramid.\\n\\nBut perhaps a different pyramid.\\n\\nSuppose we take a base that is not a face.\\n\\nFor example, take four points that form a larger area?\\nBut in a cube, maximum area of a planar quadrilateral formed by vertices.\\n\\nThe largest planar set: actually, a face has area 1. Is there a planar quadrilateral with area >1?\\nConsider points (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,1,1),(0,0,1). These are coplanar? Let's see.\\nVectors: from (0,0,0): (1,1,0), (1,1,1), (0,0,1)\\nNormal? Or compute if coplanar: the four points.\\nActually, these four points: (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,1,1),(0,0,1)\\nThis is a parallelogram? From (0,0,0) to (1,1,0), to (1,1,1), to (0,0,1), back to (0,0,0)?\\nVector (1,1,0), (0,0,1), (-1,-1,0), (0,0,-1) — wait, not closing.\\nBetter: points A=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,1,1), D=(0,0,1)\\nThen AB = (1,1,0), AD = (0,0,1), BC = (0,0,1), DC = (1,1,0)? D to C: (1,1,0)\\nSo AB = DC = (1,1,0), AD = BC = (0,0,1), so it's a parallelogram.\\nArea = |AB × AD| = |(1,1,0) × (0,0,1)| = |i(1*1 - 0*0) - j(1*1 - 0*0) + k(1*0 - 1*0)| wait\\ni(1*1 - 0*0) = i(1) ? Standard cross product:\\n(1,1,0) × (0,0,1) = i(1*1 - 0*0) - j(1*1 - 0*0) + k(1*0 - 1*0) = i(1) - j(1) + k(0) = (1,-1,0)\\nMagnitude √(1+1+0)=√2\\nSo area = √2 ≈1.414 >1\\n\\nNice! So this parallelogram has area √2.\\n\\nNow, this lies in what plane? Normal vector (1,-1,0), so plane x - y = constant. At (0,0,0): x-y=0.\\n\\nNow, we want to add a fifth vertex not on this plane, to make a pyramid.\\n\\nThe height will be the perpendicular distance from the apex to this plane.\\n\\nPlane: x - y = 0.\\nDistance from a point (x0,y0,z0) to plane ax+by+cz+d=0.\\nWrite plane: x - y = 0 → a=1,b=-1,c=0,d=0\\nDistance = |x0 - y0| / √(1²+(-1)²) = |x0 - y0|/√2\\n\\nNow, the cube vertices: list their (x,y) and |x-y|:\\n(0,0,0): |0|=0 → dist=0\\n(1,0,0): |1|=1 → dist=1/√2\\n(0,1,0): |-1|=1 → dist=1/√2\\n(1,1,0): |0|=0 → dist=0\\nSimilarly for z=1:\\n(0,0,1):0 →0\\n(1,0,1):1 →1/√2\\n(0,1,1):1 →1/√2\\n(1,1,1):0 →0\\n\\nThe points not on the plane (x≠y) are: (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1)\\nTheir distances to plane are all 1/√2\\n\\nWe already used (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,1,1),(0,0,1) — which are exactly the ones with x=y.\\n\\nSo available points: (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1) — all at distance 1/√2 from the plane.\\n\\nTake any one, say (1,0,0)\\n\\nNow, is this point on the same side? Doesn't matter for distance.\\n\\nNow, the convex hull of these five points: the four coplanar points forming a parallelogram of area √2, and one apex at (1,0,0)\\n\\nIs the apex visible? Meaning, does it form a pyramid without intersecting?\\n\\nNote: the base is in plane x=y, and apex at (1,0,0) where x=1,y=0, so x>y.\\n\\nThe pyramid should be fine.\\n\\nVolume = (1/3) * base_area * height\\nBase area = √2\\nHeight = perpendicular distance = |1-0|/√2 = 1/√2\\nSo volume = (1/3) * √2 * (1/√2) = (1/3)*1 = 1/3\\n\\nSame as before!\\n\\nBut is the base really planar? Yes, we assumed it is, and it is.\\n\\nBut when we add the apex, is the convex hull a pyramid? That is, is the apex connected directly to all base points?\\n\\nCheck if all edges are present.\\n\\nPoints: A=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,1,1), D=(0,0,1), E=(1,0,0)\\n\\nNow, is E connected to A,B,C,D?\\nIn convex hull, since E is not coplanar, and assuming general position.\\n\\nBut note: points A,E,B: (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(1,1,0) — these are on the bottom face.\\nSimilarly, A,E,D: (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(0,0,1) — these are three points.\\n\\nBut is the face A-B-C-D planar? Yes.\\n\\nNow, the convex hull: the base quadrilateral A-B-C-D, and apex E.\\n\\nBut is E visible from the entire base? Or is part of the base obscured?\\n\\nNote that the line from E to C: C=(1,1,1), E=(1,0,0)\\nAnd from E to D: D=(0,0,1)\\n\\nBut consider point F=(1,0,1) — not chosen.\\n\\nActually, the convex hull might include other faces.\\n\\nBut since the base is convex and the apex is outside, the convex hull should be a pyramid with quadrilateral base.\\n\\nHowever, we must ensure that the apex is on one side and the base is visible.\\n\\nThe plane of the base is x=y.\\nThe apex E=(1,0,0) has x-y=1>0.\\nAll base points have x-y=0.\\nSo apex is strictly on one side.\\nMoreover, the base is convex (parallelogram), so yes, the convex hull is a pyramid with that base and apex.\\n\\nThus volume is (1/3)*base_area*height = (1/3)*√2*(1/√2)=1/3\\n\\nSame as the square pyramid.\\n\\nCan we get more than 1/3?\\n\\nPerhaps if the five points are not forming a pyramid, but a different polyhedron.\\n\\nFor example, a triangular bipyramid or something.\\n\\nAnother idea: take two opposite edges and a point.\\n\\nOr, consider that the maximum volume might be achieved when the five points include vertices that are mutually far apart.\\n\\nNote: total volume of cube is 1, but we can't achieve that.\\n\\nAnother configuration: take a tetrahedron and add a point.\\n\\nEarlier tetrahedron had volume 1/3, but adding a fifth point might increase the volume.\\n\\nFor example, take the large tetrahedron: (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1) — volume 1/3 as computed.\\nNow add a fifth point, say (1,1,1).\\n\\nNow, what is the convex hull of these five points?\\n\\nPoints: A=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1), E=(1,1,1)\\n\\nNow, this includes almost all points except (0,0,1) and (1,0,0)? Missing (0,0,1) and (1,0,0), but we have five.\\n\\nNow, to find volume of convex hull.\\n\\nWe can divide into tetrahedrons.\\n\\nNote that these five points: observe that E=(1,1,1) is adjacent.\\n\\nOne way: the convex hull might be a polyhedron with faces.\\n\\nNotice that points A,B,C,D form a tetrahedron of volume 1/3.\\nAdding E, which is outside.\\n\\nThe new convex hull will include E and connect to some faces.\\n\\nWe can compute the volume by dividing into tetrahedrons from a fixed point.\\n\\nFix point A=(0,0,0).\\n\\nThen the other points: B,C,D,E.\\n\\nBut they may not all be visible, but in this case, likely.\\n\\nThe convex hull faces: let's see which tetrahedrons are formed.\\n\\nSince all points are vertices of the cube, and this set is symmetric.\\n\\nNote that the five points are all except (0,0,1) and (1,0,0)? List: cube has 8 vertices.\\nChosen: (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1)\\nMissing: (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1) — three missing.\\n\\nNow, to compute volume.\\n\\nUse the formula for convex hull volume.\\n\\nDivide the polyhedron into tetrahedrons.\\n\\nOne way: from point E=(1,1,1), connect to the faces of the tetrahedron ABCD that are visible.\\n\\nBut ABCD is a tetrahedron, and E is another point.\\n\\nNote that E is adjacent to B,C,D.\\n\\nIn fact, the convex hull might consist of several tetrahedrons.\\n\\nList the faces.\\n\\nObserve that points B,C,D,E are all with x+y+z even? A=(0,0,0) sum 0, B=(1,1,0) sum 2, C=(1,0,1) sum 2, D=(0,1,1) sum 2, E=(1,1,1) sum 3 — mixed.\\n\\nCompute vectors.\\n\\nUse the following method: the volume can be computed by choosing a point and summing volumes of tetrahedrons formed with each face, but only if the point is inside, which it's not.\\n\\nBetter: use the general formula for polyhedron volume: sum over faces of (1/3) * area_vector · centroid, but complicated.\\n\\nDivide into tetrahedrons sharing a common edge or point.\\n\\nFix point A=(0,0,0).\\n\\nNow, the other points: B,C,D,E.\\n\\nThe convex hull from A: we need to see which triangles are faces.\\n\\nNote that the polyhedron has faces:\\n- Triangle A-B-C\\n- Triangle A-C-E? Let's see.\\n\\nActually, plot the points.\\n\\nA=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1), E=(1,1,1)\\n\\nNow, distance A to B: √2, A to C: √2, A to D: √2, A to E: √3\\nB to C: from (1,1,0) to (1,0,1): difference (0,-1,1), dist √(0+1+1)=√2\\nSimilarly, B to D: (1,1,0) to (0,1,1): (-1,0,1), dist √2\\nB to E: (1,1,0) to (1,1,1): (0,0,1), dist 1\\nC to D: (1,0,1) to (0,1,1): (-1,1,0), dist √2\\nC to E: (1,0,1) to (1,1,1): (0,1,0), dist 1\\nD to E: (0,1,1) to (1,1,1): (1,0,0), dist 1\\n\\nNow, likely faces include:\\n- Triangle B-C-E: points (1,1,0),(1,0,1),(1,1,1) — all have x=1? B has x=1, C x=1, E x=1 — yes, on plane x=1.\\nSimilarly, triangle B-D-E: B=(1,1,0), D=(0,1,1), E=(1,1,1) — y=1? B y=1, D y=1, E y=1 — yes, plane y=1.\\nTriangle C-D-E: C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1), E=(1,1,1) — z=1? C z=1, D z=1, E z=1 — yes, plane z=1.\\n\\nNow, what about A? A is connected.\\nTriangle A-B-C: A=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1)\\nSimilarly, triangle A-B-D: A,B,D\\nAnd triangle A-C-D? A,C,D\\n\\nBut A-C-D: points (0,0,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1)\\nThis might be a face.\\n\\nAlso, is there a face A-B-E? Probably not, because B and E are connected, but A to E might not be direct if obstructed.\\n\\nNote that the three faces on x=1,y=1,z=1 planes meet at E.\\n\\nThe remaining part is near A.\\n\\nLikely, the convex hull has faces:\\n- Triangle A-B-C\\n- Triangle A-C-D\\n- Triangle A-D-B\\n- And the three triangles on the 'top': B-C-E, C-D-E, D-B-E? Earlier I said B-D-E, but D-B-E is same.\\n\\nBut triangle B-C-E, C-D-E, and B-D-E — but B-D-E and B-C-E share B-E, etc.\\n\\nBut do they cover? The quadrilateral B-C-E-D? But we have three triangles: B-C-E, C-D-E, and B-D-E — but that would be redundant.\\n\\nActually, points B,C,D,E: are they coplanar? B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1), E=(1,1,1)\\nVectors from B: to C: (0,-1,1), to D: (-1,0,1), to E: (0,0,1)\\nNow, normal: (C-B) × (D-B) = (0,-1,1) × (-1,0,1) = i( (-1)*1 - 1*0 ) - j( 0*1 - 1*(-1) ) + k( 0*0 - (-1)*(-1) ) = i(-1) - j(0 +1) + k(0 -1) = (-1, -1, -1)? Compute:\\ni( (-1)(1) - (1)(0) ) = i(-1 - 0) = -i\\nj component: minus [ (0)(1) - (1)(-1) ] = - [0 - (-1)] = -[1] = -1 → so +1j? No, the j component has a negative sign in cross product.\\nStandard: i (By Cz - Bz Cy) for vectors U×V, i(Uy Vz - Uz Vy)\\nU = C-B = (0,-1,1), V = D-B = (-1,0,1)\\ni( (-1)*1 - 1*0 ) = i(-1 - 0) = -i\\nj( -( Ux Vz - Uz Vx ) ) = - ( 0*1 - 1*(-1) ) = - (0 +1) = -1 → so -j? The j component is - (Ux Vz - Uz Vx) = - (0*1 - 1*(-1)) = - (0 +1) = -1, so coefficient -1 for j, meaning -j\\nk( Ux Vy - Uy Vx ) = (0*0 - (-1)*(-1)) = (0 - 1) = -1 → -k\\nSo cross product: (-1, -1, -1)? i,j,k components: -1, -1, -1 so (-1,-1,-1)\\nNow, vector to E: E-B = (0,0,1)\\nDot product with normal: (-1,-1,-1)·(0,0,1) = -1 ≠0, so not coplanar.\\n\\nThe three triangles: B-C-E, C-D-E, D-B-E — but D-B-E is same as B-D-E.\\nBut these three triangles together form a surface, but they overlap or something? No, they share edges.\\nTriangle B-C-E, triangle C-D-E, and triangle B-D-E — but B-D-E and B-C-E share edge B-E, but the region between C,D is covered by C-D-E, but the triangle B-C-D is not included.\\nActually, these three triangles form a triangular bipyramid or something? Points B,C,D,E.\\nBut with three triangles meeting at E, and base B-C-D.\\nYes: if we have triangle B-C-D and then apex E, but we don't have triangle B-C-D as a face necessarily.\\nIn this case, since B,C,D are not coplanar with E, but we can have pyramid with base B-C-D and apex E.\\nBut earlier we have the three lateral faces.\\nFor the convex hull, if E is on one side, then yes.\\nBut in our case, the base B-C-D: points B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1)\\nThis is a triangle.\\nAnd E=(1,1,1)\\nNow, is E on the same side as the normal?\\nBut anyway, back to the full polyhedron.\\n\\nPerhaps the convex hull of the five points is a polyhedron with five faces: three quadrilaterals or something.\\n\\nAnother idea: the maximum volume might be 1/2.\\n\\nRecall that in a cube, the largest volume with k points.\\n\\nI recall that for 5 points, the maximum volume convex hull is 1/2.\\n\\nHow? Take a regular tetrahedron, but in cube it's hard.\\n\\nAnother configuration: take four points of a face, but not the whole face? No.\\n\\nTake two adjacent faces.\\n\\nFor example, take all vertices except three that are mutually adjacent.\\n\\nSuppose we take the five points including both ends of a space diagonal.\\n\\nTry: take (0,0,0) and (1,1,1), the antipodal points.\\nThen add three more.\\n\\nTo maximize, add points far from the line joining them.\\n\\nThe line from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1) is the diagonal.\\nPoints far from it are like (1,0,0), (0,1,0), etc.\\n\\nTake (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)\\nThese are five points: the 'even' parity or something.\\n(0,0,0) sum 0, (1,1,1) sum 3, (1,0,0) sum 1, (0,1,0) sum 1, (0,0,1) sum 1 — mixed.\\n\\nNow, what is the convex hull?\\nThis looks familiar — it's almost the whole cube minus three corners.\\nSpecifically, missing (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1)\\n\\nNow, this polyhedron: it includes the origin and the three adjacent vertices on the axes, and the opposite corner (1,1,1)\\n\\nThis should be a polyhedron with vertices at these five points.\\n\\nTo find its volume.\\n\\nWe can see that it consists of several parts.\\n\\nNote that from (0,0,0) to (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), and to (1,1,1)\\n\\nOne way to compute volume: use the fact that this is a square pyramid or divide into tetrahedrons.\\n\\nDivide into two parts: for example, tetrahedron (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1) and then the remaining part.\\nBut the remaining part includes (1,1,1)\\n\\nThe convex hull might be divided as follows: consider the tetrahedron T1 = (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(1,1,1)\\nBut (0,0,1) is not in it.\\n\\nBetter: fix (0,0,0) and (1,1,1), and the other three.\\n\\nNote that the three points (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1) are on the coordinate planes.\\n\\nThe convex hull is a polyhedron known as a disphenoid or something, but let's calculate.\\n\\nWe can use the inclusion of the unit cube.\\n\\nNotice that the convex hull of these five points contains the points and fills a certain region.\\n\\nWe can compute the volume by noting that it is the set of points where x,y,z >=0, and x+y+z <=2 or something, but let's see the bounds.\\n\\nThe faces: likely, there is a face between (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(1,1,1)?\\nPoints (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(1,1,1): are they coplanar with others?\\nSimilarly, (1,0,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,1), and (0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,1)\\nAnd also the face (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(0,1,0), but that might not be a face because (0,0,1) is there.\\nActually, the three points (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1) may form a triangle, and (0,0,0) and (1,1,1) are apices.\\n\\nIn fact, this polyhedron is a triangular bipyramid with the triangle being (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1) and apices (0,0,0) and (1,1,1)?\\nBut is (0,0,0) connected to the triangle?\\nDistance from (0,0,0) to (1,0,0) is 1, etc., but the point (0,0,0) is not on the same side.\\n\\nLet me check if the five points are in convex position.\\n\\nAssume the convex hull has faces:\\n- Triangle (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(0,1,0)\\n- Triangle (0,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)\\n- Triangle (0,0,0),(0,0,1),(1,0,0)\\n- Triangle (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(1,1,1)\\n- Triangle (0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,1)\\n- Triangle (0,0,1),(1,0,0),(1,1,1)\\n- And triangle (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)? But that might not be a face.\\n\\nThis is messy.\\n\\nUse the formula for volume of convex hull.\\n\\nOne reliable way is to divide the polyhedron into tetrahedrons.\\n\\nFor example, from vertex (0,0,0), we can see that it is connected to (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), and (1,1,1)?\\nBut likely, the convex hull has a face that is a quadrilateral or something.\\n\\nNotice that the three points (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) are not coplanar with (0,0,0) or (1,1,1), but let's see the plane they form.\\nPoints P=(1,0,0), Q=(0,1,0), R=(0,0,1)\\nVectors PQ = (-1,1,0), PR = (-1,0,1)\\nCross product: i(1*1 - 0*0) - j( -1*1 - (-1)*0 ) + k( -1*0 - (-1)*1 ) = i(1) - j(-1) + k(1) = (1,1,1)\\nSo normal (1,1,1), plane x+y+z=1 (since at P:1+0+0=1)\\nNow, point (0,0,0): 0<1, point (1,1,1):3>1, so they are on opposite sides.\\nTherefore, the convex hull has this triangle PQR as a face, and then (0,0,0) and (1,1,1) on opposite sides, so it is a triangular bipyramid with base PQR and apices (0,0,0) and (1,1,1).\\nIs that possible? In a bipyramid, the base is internal, but here the base PQR is a face, and the two apices are on opposite sides.\\nYes, and since the line from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1) passes through the plane x+y+z=1 at (1/3,1/3,1/3), which is inside the triangle PQR? The triangle PQR has vertices at (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1), and the point (1/3,1/3,1/3) is the centroid, which is inside.\\nSo yes, the convex hull is a triangular bipyramid with equatorial triangle PQR and apices A=(0,0,0) and B=(1,1,1).\\nVolume of a bipyramid is (1/3) * area_of_base * (h1 + h2), where h1 and h2 are the distances from the apices to the plane of the base.\\nHere, base is triangle PQR in plane x+y+z=1.\\nArea of triangle PQR: as computed, vectors PQ=(-1,1,0), PR=(-1,0,1), cross product (1,1,1), magnitude √3, so area = (1/2)*|PQ × PR| = (1/2)*√3\\nNow, distance from A=(0,0,0) to plane x+y+z-1=0: |0+0+0-1|/√(1²+1²+1²) = 1/√3\\nDistance from B=(1,1,1) to the same plane: |1+1+1-1|/√3 = |2|/√3 = 2/√3\\nNow, volume = (1/3) * base_area * (h1 + h2) = (1/3) * (√3 / 2) * (1/√3 + 2/√3) = (1/3) * (√3 / 2) * (3/√3) = (1/3) * (√3 / 2) * √3 * √3 / √3 wait\\n3/√3 = √3\\nSo = (1/3) * (√3 / 2) * √3 = (1/3) * (3 / 2) = (1/3)*(1.5) = 0.5\\nCompute:\\n(√3 / 2) * √3 = (3/2)\\nThen (1/3) * (3/2) = 1/2\\nYes, volume = 1/2\\n\\nOh! So 0.5\\n\\nNow, is this valid? Are these five points the vertices of the convex hull? That is, are there any other points or is this correct?\\nThe convex hull should be just these five points, and since they are in convex position (no one inside the convex hull of others), yes.\\nFor example, is (0,0,0) inside the tetrahedron of the others? No, because the others have coordinates summing to at least 1, while (0,0,0) is at origin.\\nSimilarly, all are extreme points.\\nSo yes.\\nVolume is 1/2.\\n\\nNow, is this larger than previous 1/3? Yes, 0.5 > 0.333.\\n\\nCan we get larger?\\nMaximum possible: the cube has volume 1, but with 5 points, probably not more than 1/2.\\nSuppose we try to include more volume.\\nBut 1/2 seems plausible.\\nAnother configuration: take a whole face and two opposite corners, but we have only 5 points.\\nFor example, take the bottom face: (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(1,1,0),(0,1,0), and then (1,1,1). But that's 5 points.\\nConvex hull: this is a square pyramid with base on z=0 and apex (1,1,1).\\nBase area 1, height 1, volume (1/3)*1*1=1/3 < 1/2.\\nWorse.\\nOther configurations seem smaller.\\nSo 1/2 is better.\\n\\nIs there a configuration with volume larger than 1/2?\\nSuppose we take points that are not including the origin.\\nBut by symmetry, probably not.\\nMaximum is 1/2.\\n\\nConfirm with another method.\\nIn the bipyramid: points (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,1)\\nWe can compute volume by dividing into two tetrahedrons: for example, tetrahedron (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(1,1,1) and tetrahedron (0,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,1), but they overlap on the face (0,0,0),(0,1,0),(1,1,1), and also miss some part.\\nBetter to use the bipyramid formula, or divide along a diagonal.\\nSince it's a bipyramid, volume is sum of two tetrahedrons: one from apex A to base, one from apex B to base.\\nTetrahedron A-P-Q-R: points (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)\\nVolume = (1/6) | scalar triple product |\\nVectors from A: u=(1,0,0), v=(0,1,0), w=(0,0,1)\\nu·(v×w) = (1,0,0)·( (0,1,0)×(0,0,1) ) = (1,0,0)·(i(1*1-0*0) -j(0*1-0*0) +k(0*0-1*0)) wait\\nv×w = (0,1,0)×(0,0,1) = i(1*1 - 0*0) - j(0*1 - 0*0) + k(0*0 - 1*0) = i(1) - j(0) + k(0) = (1,0,0)\\nThen u·(1,0,0) = 1*1 +0+0=1\\n|det|=1, volume=1/6\\nBut this tetrahedron is only part.\\nNow, the other tetrahedron: B-P-Q-R: (1,1,1),(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)\\nVectors from B: to P: (1,0,0)-(1,1,1)=(0,-1,-1), to Q: (0,1,0)-(1,1,1)=(-1,0,-1), to R: (0,0,1)-(1,1,1)=(-1,-1,0)\\nScalar triple product: u·(v×w) with u=(0,-1,-1), v=(-1,0,-1), w=(-1,-1,0)\\nv×w = (-1,0,-1)×(-1,-1,0) = i(0*0 - (-1)*(-1)) - j( -1*0 - (-1)*(-1) ) + k( -1*(-1) - 0*(-1) ) = i(0 - 1) - j(0 - 1) + k(1 - 0) = (-1, -(-1), 1) = (-1,1,1)? Compute:\\ni( (0)(0) - (-1)(-1) ) = i(0 - 1) = -i\\nj component: -[ (-1)(0) - (-1)(-1) ] = -[0 - 1] = -[-1] = 1 → so +j? The j component is - (Ux Wz - Uz Wx) = - [ (-1)(0) - (-1)(-1) ] = - [0 - 1] = -[-1] = 1, so +1j\\nk( Ux Wy - Uy Wx ) = (-1)(-1) - (0)(-1) = 1 - 0 = 1 → +k\\nSo v×w = (-1,1,1)\\nThen u·(-1,1,1) = (0,-1,-1)·(-1,1,1) = 0*(-1) + (-1)*1 + (-1)*1 = 0 -1 -1 = -2\\n|det|=2, volume=2/6=1/3\\nNow, if we add the two tetrahedrons: 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/6 + 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2\\nAnd since they share only the face PQR, and are on opposite sides, no overlap, and their union is the bipyramid, so total volume is 1/2.\\nPerfect.\\n\\nNow, is this the maximum? Can we get more?\\nSuppose we try a different set.\\nFor example, take the five points including (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1) as before, but we computed that the tetrahedron alone is 1/3, and adding a point might give less than 1/2.\\nIn that case, the convex hull volume: we can compute, but likely less.\\nSince 1/2 is half the cube, and the cube is symmetric, probably this is maximum.\\nI recall that the maximum volume convex hull of 5 points in a unit cube is indeed 1/2.\\nSo answer should be 1/2.\\n\\nThus, for Problem 2, answer is 1/2.\\n\\nNow, back to Problem 1, we have n=1,13,43,91,157.\\n\\nSo final answers.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1,13,43,91,157\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/2\"\n}",
