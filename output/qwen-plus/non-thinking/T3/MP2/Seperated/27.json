That means they are roots of the quadratic equation:\\n$$\\nx^2 + x - A = 0\\n$$\\nSince $x_1 \\\\ne x_2$, this quadratic has two distinct roots, so discriminant $D = 1 + 4A > 0$, but since we allow complex numbers, even if discriminant is negative or zero, as long as roots are distinct. But for now, just note that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the two (possibly complex) roots of $x^2 + x - A = 0$. So by Vieta's formulas:\\n$$\\nx_1 + x_2 = -1,\\\\quad x_1 x_2 = -A\\n$$\\nNow, we are also told:\\n$$\\nx_1^4 + 3x_1^3 + 5x_1 = x_2^4 + 3x_2^3 + 5x_2\\n\\\\Rightarrow x_1^4 + 3x_1^3 + 5x_1 - (x_2^4 + 3x_2^3 + 5x_2) = 0\\n\\\\Rightarrow (x_1^4 - x_2^4) + 3(x_1^3 - x_2^3) + 5(x_1 - x_2) = 0\\n$$\\nFactor each term using difference of powers:\\n- $x_1^4 - x_2^4 = (x_1 - x_2)(x_1^3 + x_1^2 x_2 + x_1 x_2^2 + x_2^3)$\\n- $x_1^3 - x_2^3 = (x_1 - x_2)(x_1^2 + x_1 x_2 + x_2^2)$\\n- $x_1 - x_2 = (x_1 - x_2)$\\n\\nDivide both sides by $x_1 - x_2 \\\\ne 0$ (since $x_1 \\\\ne x_2$):\\n$$\\n(x_1^3 + x_1^2 x_2 + x_1 x_2^2 + x_2^3) + 3(x_1^2 + x_1 x_2 + x_2^2) + 5 = 0\\n$$\\nSimplify step by step.\\n\\nGroup terms:\\nFirst, $x_1^3 + x_2^3 + x_1^2 x_2 + x_1 x_2^2 = (x_1^3 + x_2^3) + x_1 x_2(x_1 + x_2)$\\nBut recall identity: $x_1^3 + x_2^3 = (x_1 + x_2)^3 - 3x_1 x_2 (x_1 + x_2)$\\n\\nAlternatively, factor symmetric expressions.\\n\\nLet $s = x_1 + x_2 = -1$, $p = x_1 x_2 = -A$\\n\\nWe will express everything in terms of $s$ and $p$.\\n\\nFirst, compute:\\n$$\\nx_1^3 + x_1^2 x_2 + x_1 x_2^2 + x_2^3 = (x_1^3 + x_2^3) + x_1 x_2(x_1 + x_2)\\n= (s^3 - 3s p) + p s = s^3 - 3s p + s p = s^3 - 2s p\\n$$\\nNext,\\n$$\\nx_1^2 + x_1 x_2 + x_2^2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + p = (s^2 - 2p) + p = s^2 - p\\n$$\\nSo the entire expression becomes:\\n$$\\n(s^3 - 2s p) + 3(s^2 - p) + 5 = 0\\n$$\\nNow plug in $s = -1$:\\n$$\\n((-1)^3 - 2(-1)p) + 3((-1)^2 - p) + 5 = 0\\n\\\\Rightarrow (-1 + 2p) + 3(1 - p) + 5 = 0\\n\\\\Rightarrow -1 + 2p + 3 - 3p + 5 = 0\\n\\\\Rightarrow ( -1 + 3 + 5 ) + (2p - 3p) = 0\\n\\\\Rightarrow 7 - p = 0 \\\\Rightarrow p = 7\\n$$\\nBut $p = x_1 x_2 = -A$, so:\\n$$\\n-A = 7 \\\\Rightarrow A = -7\\n$$\\nNow check whether for $A = -7$, there exist **distinct** complex numbers $x_1, x_2$ satisfying the equations.\\n\\nEquation: $x^2 + x + 7 = 0$ (since $x^2 + x - A = x^2 + x + 7 = 0$)\\nDiscriminant: $1 - 28 = -27 < 0$, so two distinct complex roots — good.\\nAlso, by construction, they satisfy same value of $A$, and our derivation shows that the third condition holds iff $A = -7$.\\n\\nHence the only such real value is $A = -7$.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nEvaluate:\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{n=2}^{17} \\\\frac{n^2 + n + 1}{n^4 + 2n^3 - n^2 - 2n}\\n$$\\nFirst, simplify the denominator:\\n$$\\nn^4 + 2n^3 - n^2 - 2n = n(n^3 + 2n^2 - n - 2)\\n$$\\nFactor $n^3 + 2n^2 - n - 2$:\\nTry rational roots: possible $\\\\pm1, \\\\pm2$\\nTry $n=1$: $1 + 2 -1 -2 = 0$ → yes, $n-1$ is a factor.\\nDivide:\\n$$\\nn^3 + 2n^2 - n - 2 = (n - 1)(n^2 + 3n + 2) = (n - 1)(n + 1)(n + 2)\\n$$\\nSo full factorization:\\n$$\\nn^4 + 2n^3 - n^2 - 2n = n(n - 1)(n + 1)(n + 2)\\n$$\\nSo the expression becomes:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{n^2 + n + 1}{n(n - 1)(n + 1)(n + 2)}\\n$$\\nNote: $n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2) = (n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)$ — product of four consecutive integers almost, but not quite symmetric.\\n\\nWe aim to decompose:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{n^2 + n + 1}{(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)}\\n$$\\nUse partial fractions.\\nLet:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{n^2 + n + 1}{(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)} = \\\\frac{A}{n-1} + \\\\frac{B}{n} + \\\\frac{C}{n+1} + \\\\frac{D}{n+2}\\n$$\\nMultiply both sides by $(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)$:\\n$$\\nn^2 + n + 1 = A n (n+1)(n+2) + B (n-1)(n+1)(n+2) + C (n-1)n(n+2) + D (n-1)n(n+1)\\n$$\\nNow plug in suitable values.\\n\\nLet $n = 1$:\\nLeft: $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$\\nRight: $A(1)(2)(3) = 6A \\\\Rightarrow 6A = 3 \\\\Rightarrow A = \\\\frac{1}{2}$\\n\\nLet $n = 0$:\\nLeft: $0 + 0 + 1 = 1$\\nRight: $B(-1)(1)(2) = -2B \\\\Rightarrow -2B = 1 \\\\Rightarrow B = -\\\\frac{1}{2}$\\n\\nLet $n = -1$:\\nLeft: $1 -1 +1 = 1$\\nRight: $C(-2)(-1)(1) = 2C \\\\Rightarrow C = \\\\frac{1}{2}$\\n\\nLet $n = -2$:\\nLeft: $4 - 2 + 1 = 3$\\nRight: $D(-3)(-2)(-1) = D(-6) \\\\Rightarrow -6D = 3 \\\\Rightarrow D = -\\\\frac{1}{2}$\\n\\nSo:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{n^2 + n + 1}{(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)} = \\\\frac{1/2}{n-1} - \\\\frac{1/2}{n} + \\\\frac{1/2}{n+1} -
