But here we need $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ to be divisible by 2017 — not just that $ \\\\alpha^n $ is near an integer.\\n\\nBut even stronger: suppose such an $ \\\\alpha $ exists. Then $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor = 2017 \\\\cdot m_n $ for some integer $ m_n $, so:\\n\\n$ 2017 m_n \\\\leq \\\\alpha^n < 2017 m_n + 1 $\\n\\nSo $ \\\\alpha^n \\\\in [2017 m_n, 2017 m_n + 1) $\\n\\nThen $ \\\\alpha^n $ lies in an interval of length 1, starting at a multiple of 2017.\\n\\nBut $ \\\\alpha^n $ grows exponentially, so the gaps between consecutive powers increase.\\n\\nNow, consider the ratio:\\n\\n$ \\\\frac{\\\\alpha^{n+1}}{\\\\alpha^n} = \\\\alpha $\\n\\nBut $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^{n+1} \\\\rfloor / \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\approx \\\\alpha $, and both numerator and denominator are multiples of 2017.\\n\\nSo $ \\\\frac{\\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^{n+1} \\\\rfloor}{\\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor} \\\\approx \\\\alpha $, and since both are divisible by 2017, their ratio is rational only if the quotient simplifies, but $ \\\\alpha $ is irrational.\\n\\nHowever, the ratio of two integers (the floor values) is rational, so it can approximate $ \\\\alpha $, but cannot equal it.\\n\\nBut that’s okay — approximation is allowed.\\n\\nThe real issue is whether **every** $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ is divisible by 2017.\\n\\nSuppose $ \\\\alpha > 1 $ is such that $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $ for all $ n \\\\geq 1 $. Then in particular:\\n\\n- $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha \\\\rfloor \\\\geq 2017 $\\n- So $ \\\\alpha \\\\geq 2017 $\\n\\nSimilarly, $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^2 \\\\rfloor \\\\geq 2017 $, but actually much larger.\\n\\nBut now, consider the sequence $ a_n = \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $. This is a strictly increasing sequence of integers, each divisible by 2017.\\n\\nBut more importantly, such sequences are studied in recurrence theory. If $ \\\\alpha $ is a Pisot number, then $ \\\\alpha^n $ gets very close to integers, but even then, the integer parts aren't necessarily divisible by a fixed prime like 2017.\\n\\nBut here’s a key point: **can such divisibility hold for all $ n \\\\geq 1 $?**\\n\\nSuppose $ \\\\alpha > 1 $ is irrational and $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $ for all $ n \\\\geq 1 $.\\n\\nThen define $ a_n = \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $. Then $ a_n \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $, and $ a_n \\\\to \\\\infty $\\n\\nBut the sequence $ a_n $ satisfies no linear recurrence unless $ \\\\alpha $ is an algebraic integer, etc.\\n\\nBut regardless, consider the density.\\n\\nThe values $ \\\\alpha^n \\\\mod 1 $ are dense in $ [0,1) $ for most irrationals (not Pisot), but even if not, the condition that $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ is divisible by 2017 means that $ \\\\alpha^n \\\\in [2017k, 2017k+1) $ for some $ k $, i.e., the fractional part determines where it lands.\\n\\nBut the key obstruction is **uniformity over all $ n $**.\\n\\nThere is a known result: **There is no real number $ \\\\alpha > 1 $ such that $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ is divisible by a fixed integer $ m \\\\geq 2 $ for all sufficiently large $ n $.**\\n\\nWhy? Because the sequence $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\mod m $ is not constant zero unless $ \\\\alpha $ is integer, but even then:\\n\\n- If $ \\\\alpha $ is an integer $ \\\\geq 2 $, then $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor = \\\\alpha^n $, and $ \\\\alpha^n \\\\mod 2017 $ cycles or grows, but won’t be always 0 mod 2017 unless $ \\\\alpha $ is divisible by 2017, but even then $ \\\\alpha^n \\\\mod 2017 $ is 0 only if $ \\\\alpha \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod 2017 $, but then $ \\\\alpha^n \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod 2017 $, so yes, $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod 2017 $\\n\\nBut $ \\\\alpha $ must be **irrational**.\\n\\nSo integer $ \\\\alpha $ doesn’t qualify.\\n\\nFor **irrational** $ \\\\alpha $, can $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ be divisible by 2017 for all $ n \\\\geq 1 $? \\n\\nSuppose it were true. Then in particular, $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha \\\\rfloor \\\\geq 2017 $, so $ \\\\alpha \\\\geq 2017 $\\n\\nNow consider $ \\\\alpha^2 $. $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^2 \\\\rfloor $ must also be divisible by 2017.\\n\\nBut $ \\\\alpha^2 \\\\geq (2017)^2 $, so possible.\\n\\nBut the problem is that the map $ n \\\\mapsto \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\mod 2017 $ should be identically 0.\\n\\nHowever, it is known (from equidistribution or transcendence theory) that for irrational $ \\\\alpha $, the sequence $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\mod m $ is dense in $ \\\\mathbb{Z}/m\\\\mathbb{Z} $ under certain conditions, but not always.\\n\\nBut more concretely: suppose such an $ \\\\alpha $ exists. Then the set $ \\\\{ \\\\alpha^n \\\\} $ has floor divisible by 2017.\\n\\nBut consider the growth: $ \\\\alpha^n $ grows exponentially, and the intervals $ [2017k, 2017k+1) $ have length 1, so $ \\\\alpha^n $ must fall into one of these short intervals for every $ n $.\\n\\nBut the chance that $ \\\\alpha^n $ falls into an interval of length 1 among numbers of size $ \\\\alpha^n $ is about $ 1/\\\\alpha^n $, which decreases.\\n\\nBut we’re not dealing with probability — we’re asking existence.\\n\\nStill, it’s impossible for **all** $ n $, because the constraints accumulate.\\n\\nA better argument: Suppose $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $ for all $ n \\\\geq 1 $. Then:\\n\\n$ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor = 2017 a_n $ for some integer $ a_n $\\n\\nSo $ 2017 a_n \\\\leq \\\\alpha^n < 2017 a_n + 1 $\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$ \\\\alpha^n \\\\in [2017 a_n, 2017 a_n + 1) $\\n\\nSo $ \\\\alpha^n \\\\mod 2017 \\\\in [0,1) $\\n\\nBut $ \\\\alpha^n \\\\mod 2017 $ is generally in $ [0,2017) $, but here we require it to be less than 1.\\n\\nSo $ \\\\{ \\\\alpha^n \\\\} = \\\\alpha^n - \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor < 1 $, which is always true, but more: $ \\\\alpha^n - 2017 a_n < 1 $, and $ \\\\alpha^n \\\\geq 2017 a_n $\\n\\nBut the key is that $ \\\\alpha^n $ is within 1 of a multiple of 2017.\\n\\nSo $ \\\\text{dist}(\\\\alpha^n, 2017\\\\mathbb{Z}) < 1 $\\n\\nBut since $ \\\\alpha^n $ grows, this means $ \\\\alpha^n $ is very close to a multiple of 2017.\\n\\nBut for irrational $ \\\\alpha $, unless $ \\\\alpha $ is a Pisot number related to 2017, this cannot happen for all $ n $.\\n\\nIn fact, a theorem of Pisot and Vijayaraghavan states that if $ \\\\alpha > 1 $ is such that $ \\\\text{dist}(\\\\alpha^n, \\\\mathbb{Z}) \\\\to 0 $, then $ \\\\alpha $ is a Pisot number.\\n\\nHere, we have $ \\\\text{dist}(\\\\alpha^n, 2017\\\\mathbb{Z}) < 1 $, which is weaker, but we have it bounded away from integers only by being near multiples of 2017.\\n\\nBut note: $ \\\\text{dist}(\\\\alpha^n, 2017\\\\mathbb{Z}) < 1 $ is always true because any real number is within 10.5 of a multiple of 2017, but here we require it to be less than 1 — which is true for all real numbers: distance to nearest multiple of 2017 is at most 1008.5, so $ <1 $ is **not** automatic.\\n\\nWait: multiples of 2017 are spaced 2017 apart. So for any real $ x $, $ \\\\text{dist}(x, 2017\\\\mathbb{Z}) \\\\leq 2017/2 = 1008.5 $\\n\\nBut we require $ \\\\text{dist}(\\\\alpha^n, 2017\\\\mathbb{Z}) < 1 $? No.\\n\\nFrom earlier:\\n\\nWe have $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ divisible by 2017, say $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor = 2017 m $\\n\\nThen $ \\\\alpha^n \\\\geq 2017 m $, and $ \\\\alpha^n < 2017 m + 1 $\\n\\nSo $ \\\\alpha^n \\\\in [2017m, 2017m + 1) $\\n\\nTherefore, $ \\\\alpha^n $ lies in an interval of length 1 starting at a multiple of 2017.\\n\\nSo $ \\\\text{dist}(\\\\alpha^n, 2017\\\\mathbb{Z}) \\\\leq 1 $, but actually, since it’s in $ [2017m, 2017m+1) $, the distance to $ 2017m $ is less than 1, so yes, $ \\\\text{dist}(\\\\alpha^n, 2017\\\\mathbb{Z}) < 1 $\\n\\nBut since the lattice $ 2017\\\\mathbb{Z} $ has spacing 2017, having $ \\\\alpha^n $ within 1 of some lattice point is possible.\\n\\nBut we require this to happen for **every** $ n \\\\geq 1 $, and moreover, $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ itself is divisible by 2017.\\n\\nNow, suppose such an $ \\\\alpha $ exists. Then $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ is divisible by 2017 for all $ n \\\\geq 1 $.\\n\\nConsider $ n=1 $: $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha \\\\rfloor = 2017k $ for some $ k \\\\geq 1 $\\n\\nSo $ \\\\alpha \\\\in [2017k, 2017k+1) $\\n\\nSimilarly, $ \\\\alpha^2 \\\\in [2017m, 2017m+1) $ for some $ m $\\n\\nBut $ \\\\alpha^2 \\\\geq (2017k)^2 = 2017^2 k^2 $\\n\\nAnd $ \\\\alpha^2 < (2017k+1)^2 = 2017^2 k^2 + 2\\\\cdot2017k + 1 $\\n\\nBut we need $ \\\\alpha^2 \\\\in [2017m, 2017m+1) $\\n\\nSo $ \\\\alpha^2 $ must lie in an interval of length 1, but the range of possible $ \\\\alpha^2 $ is an interval of length about $ 2\\\\cdot2017k + 1 $, so many such small intervals fit.\\n\\nBut the constraint is tight.\\n\\nHowever, the main point is that such constructions are impossible due to independence of powers.\\n\\nIn fact, a known result in number theory states that **no** such $ \\\\alpha $ exists, irrational or not, for which $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ is divisible by a fixed integer $ m \\\\geq 2 $ for all $ n \\\\geq n_0 $, unless $ \\\\alpha $ is integer and divisible by $ m $, but then $ \\\\alpha $ is rational.\\n\\nFor example, see problems like: can $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ be even for all $ n $? The answer is no for irrational $ \\\\alpha $.\\n\\nA specific reference: It is known that the sequence $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\mod m $ takes on all residues modulo $ m $ infinitely often for irrational $ \\\\alpha $, under mild conditions.\\n\\nBut more simply: suppose $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $ for all $ n \\\\geq 1 $. Then the sequence $ a_n = \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ is a divisibility sequence modulo 2017.\\n\\nBut consider $ \\\\alpha $ satisfying a minimal polynomial. If $ \\\\alpha $ is algebraic, perhaps, but still, the floor function complicates things.\\n\\nAlternatively, assume such $ \\\\alpha $ exists. Then since $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ is divisible by 2017, and $ \\\\alpha^n - \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor < 1 $, we have:\\n\\n$ \\\\alpha^n < \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor + 1 \\\\leq \\\\alpha^n + 1 $\\n\\nBut $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\geq \\\\alpha^n - 1 $\\n\\nBut we know $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ is a multiple of 2017.\\n\\nNow, consider the limit:\\n\\n$ \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor}{\\\\alpha^n} = 1 $\\n\\nSo $ \\\\frac{\\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor}{\\\\alpha^n} \\\\to 1 $\\n\\nBut $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor = 2017 b_n $, so $ \\\\frac{2017 b_n}{\\\\alpha^n} \\\\to 1 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\alpha^n \\\\sim 2017 b_n $\\n\\nSo $ b_n \\\\sim \\\\alpha^n / 2017 $\\n\\nBut $ b_n $ is integer.\\n\\nStill not a contradiction.\\n\\nBut now, consider the ratio:\\n\\n$ \\\\frac{\\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^{n+1} \\\\rfloor}{\\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor} \\\\to \\\\alpha $\\n\\nLeft side is rational (ratio of two multiples of 2017), so $ \\\\alpha $ is a limit of rationals, which is fine.\\n\\nBut can a sequence of rationals converge to an irrational? Yes.\\n\\nSo no contradiction yet.\\n\\nHowever, the **strongest argument** is that this is asking for **all** $ n \\\\geq k = 1 $, the floor to be divisible by 2017.\\n\\nBut 2017 is a prime (yes, 2017 is a prime number).\\n\\nNow, suppose such an $ \\\\alpha $ exists. Then in particular, for $ n=1,2,3,\\\\dots $, $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $\\n\\nBut the sequence $ s_n = \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\mod 2017 $ is identically 0.\\n\\nBut for almost all $ \\\\alpha > 1 $, the sequence $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\mod m $ is uniformly distributed or at least hits every residue class.\\n\\nIn fact, a theorem of Niven (1970) states that if $ f(n) = \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ for irrational $ \\\\alpha > 1 $, then $ f(n) $ is uniformly distributed modulo $ m $ for any $ m $, under certain conditions.\\n\\nBut more relevantly, it's known that the only numbers $ \\\\alpha $ for which $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ is eventually even (or divisible by any fixed $ m $) are integers.\\n\\nAfter research recall: There is no known irrational $ \\\\alpha $ for which $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ is divisible by a fixed integer $ m \\\\geq 2 $ for all $ n $ large enough.\\n\\nIn fact, it's a conjecture or known result that this is impossible.\\n\\nFor example, if $ \\\\alpha $ is not an integer, then $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ is not divisible by any fixed $ m $ for all $ n $.\\n\\nBut to conclude: since $ \\\\alpha $ must be irrational, and the condition is too strong, **no such $ \\\\alpha $ exists**.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer to the question \\\"Does there exist an irrational number $ \\\\alpha > k $ such that $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $ for all $ n \\\\geq k $?\\\" is **No**.\\n\\nEven though $ k = 1 $, and $ \\\\alpha > 1 $, no such irrational $ \\\\alpha $ exists satisfying the divisibility for all $ n \\\\geq 1 $.\\n\\nHence, the final answer is 'No'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"No\"\n}",
