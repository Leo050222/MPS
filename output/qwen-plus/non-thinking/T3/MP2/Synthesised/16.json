Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\n### Step 1: Understand the set and the conditions\\n\\nWe are working with the set $\\\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\\\}$.\\n\\nWe want subsets $S$ such that:\\n- $S$ is non-empty.\\n- No subset of $S$ (including possibly $S$ itself) has elements summing to 10.\\n\\nBut we are not asked for the total number of such subsets. Instead, we are told:\\n\\n> Find $k = N_5 - 8$, where $N_5$ is the number of non-empty subsets **whose largest element is 5** and that satisfy the condition (i.e., no subset of it sums to 10).\\n\\nThen, use this $k$ to find the number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ of nonnegative integers satisfying:\\n$$\\n(ab + k)(bc + k)(ca + k) = 84\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Find $N_5$: subsets with largest element 5, non-empty, and no subset summing to 10\\n\\nSince the largest element is 5, all elements in such subsets must be from $\\\\{1,2,3,4,5\\\\}$, and **must include 5** (otherwise the largest element wouldn't be 5).\\n\\nSo we consider subsets of the form $S = A \\\\cup \\\\{5\\\\}$, where $A \\\\subseteq \\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$, and $A$ can be empty (so $S = \\\\{5\\\\}$ is allowed).\\n\\nThere are $2^4 = 16$ possible subsets $A$, so 16 subsets where 5 is the largest element (including $\\\\{5\\\\}$). But we need only those where **no subset of $S$** has sum 10.\\n\\nNote: The condition is not just that $S$ doesn’t sum to 10, but **no subset of $S$** sums to 10.\\n\\nSo even if $S$ doesn't sum to 10, if some subset of $S$ (like $\\\\{1,4,5\\\\}$ or $\\\\{2,3,5\\\\}$) sums to 10, then $S$ is invalid.\\n\\nOur goal: among the 16 subsets containing 5 and no element greater than 5 (i.e., subsets of $\\\\{1,2,3,4,5\\\\}$ that contain 5), count how many have **no subset** summing to 10.\\n\\nLet’s denote $T = A \\\\cup \\\\{5\\\\}$, $A \\\\subseteq \\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$. We want to exclude any $T$ that contains a subset (possibly proper) whose elements sum to 10.\\n\\nLet’s first list all subsets of $\\\\{1,2,3,4,5\\\\}$ that sum to 10. Then, any superset of such a subset that includes 5 as maximum will be invalid.\\n\\n#### Subsets of $\\\\{1,2,3,4,5\\\\}$ that sum to 10:\\n\\nWe look for all subsets (not necessarily containing 5) with sum 10.\\n\\n- $\\\\{4,5,1\\\\} = 10$\\n- $\\\\{3,2,5\\\\} = 10$\\n- $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\} = 10$\\n- $\\\\{4,6\\\\}$ — but 6 is not allowed here (we're only considering subsets within $\\\\{1,2,3,4,5\\\\}$)\\n- $\\\\{5,4,1\\\\}$ already listed\\n- $\\\\{5,3,2\\\\}$ already listed\\n- $\\\\{1,4,5\\\\}$ → sum 10\\n- $\\\\{2,3,5\\\\}$ → sum 10\\n- $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$ → sum 10\\n- $\\\\{1,3,6\\\\}$ — 6 excluded\\n- $\\\\{2,8\\\\}$ — no\\n- $\\\\{10\\\\}$ — not in set\\n\\nAny others?\\n\\nTry 2-element:\\n- $5+5$: no\\n- $6+4$: 6 not allowed\\n- $5+4=9$, $5+3=8$, $5+2=7$, $5+1=6$, $4+3=7$, etc. → no 2-element subsets sum to 10\\n\\n3-element:\\n- $1+4+5 = 10$ ✓\\n- $2+3+5 = 10$ ✓\\n- $1+3+6$ → invalid\\n- $2+4+4$ → no\\n- $1+2+7$ → no\\n- $3+4+3$ → no\\n- $1+2+3+4 = 10$ ✓\\n\\n4-element: only $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$\\n\\n5-element: $\\\\{1,2,3,4,5\\\\} = 15$ → too big\\n\\nSo the subsets summing to 10 within $\\\\{1,2,3,4,5\\\\}$ are:\\n1. $\\\\{1,4,5\\\\}$\\n2. $\\\\{2,3,5\\\\}$\\n3. $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$\\n\\nAre there others?\\n\\nTry $\\\\{1,3,6\\\\}$ — no\\n$\\\\{2,8\\\\}$ — no\\n$\\\\{4,6\\\\}$ — no\\n$\\\\{1,2,7\\\\}$ — no\\n\\nWhat about $\\\\{4,6\\\\}$? 6 not allowed.\\n\\nHow about $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$ — yes, sum 10.\\n\\nIs there a 1-element? 10? no.\\n\\n2-element: max is 5+4=9 → none.\\n\\nSo only three subsets sum to 10:\\n- $A = \\\\{1,4,5\\\\}$\\n- $B = \\\\{2,3,5\\\\}$\\n- $C = \\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$\\n\\nNow, any subset $S$ that contains 5 as maximum and contains one of these as a subset is invalid.\\n\\nSo we want subsets $S = \\\\{5\\\\} \\\\cup A$, $A \\\\subseteq \\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$, such that $S$ does **not** contain any of these three subsets.\\n\\nThat is:\\n- $S$ must not contain $\\\\{1,4,5\\\\}$ as a subset → so if $S$ contains 1 and 4, then since it always contains 5, $\\\\{1,4,5\\\\} \\\\subseteq S$, which is bad.\\n- Similarly, if $S$ contains 2 and 3, then $\\\\{2,3,5\\\\} \\\\subseteq S$ → bad.\\n- If $S$ contains $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$, i.e., all four, then $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\} \\\\subseteq S$, sum 10 → bad.\\n\\nSo we must avoid:\\n1. $1 \\\\in S$ and $4 \\\\in S$ → implies $\\\\{1,4,5\\\\} \\\\subseteq S$\\n2. $2 \\\\in S$ and $3 \\\\in S$ → implies $\\\\{2,3,5\\\\} \\\\subseteq S$\\n3. $1,2,3,4$ all in $S$ → implies $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\} \\\\subseteq S$\\n\\nBut note: condition 3 is actually implied by conditions 1 and 2? Not quite. Condition 3 is independent: you could have all four without violating 1 or 2? Wait: if you have 1 and 4 → violates 1; 2 and 3 → violates 2. So having all four would violate both 1 and 2. So actually, condition 3 is redundant because any set containing $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$ must contain 1 and 4, and 2 and 3, so it would already be excluded by the first two conditions.\\n\\nThus, to avoid any subset summing to 10, it suffices to ensure:\\n- Not both 1 and 4 are in $S$\\n- Not both 2 and 3 are in $S$\\n\\nBecause:\\n- If both 1 and 4 are in $S$, then $\\\\{1,4,5\\\\} \\\\subseteq S$, sum = 10 → invalid\\n- If both 2 and 3 are in $S$, then $\\\\{2,3,5\\\\} \\\\subseteq S$, sum = 10 → invalid\\n- If all four are in, then both above happen → already excluded\\n- Is there any other way to get a subset summing to 10? For example, could some other combination like $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$ appear? But that requires all four, which is already covered.\\n\\nWait: $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$ sums to 10, but if a set contains all four, it's already invalid due to containing 1 and 4, or 2 and 3. But suppose a set contains $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$ but not 5? But in our case, all sets contain 5, so if they contain $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$, they contain 1,4 and 2,3, so already invalid.\\n\\nAre there any other subsets summing to 10?\\n\\nTry: $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\} = 10$ — already considered\\n$\\\\{1,3,6\\\\}$ — 6 not present\\n$\\\\{2,4,4\\\\}$ — no\\n$\\\\{5,4,1\\\\}$ — same as before\\n\\nWhat about $\\\\{1,2,7\\\\}$ — no\\n\\nOr $\\\\{6,4\\\\}$ — no\\n\\nHow about $\\\\{10\\\\}$ — not in set\\n\\nSo only three subsets sum to 10, and avoiding the two pairs (1 and 4), (2 and 3) ensures we don’t have any subset summing to 10.\\n\\nBut wait: is there a subset like $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$ that doesn’t require 5? Yes, but if $S$ contains $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$, then it contains a subset (itself minus 5? no, $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$ is a subset) that sums to 10. But to have $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\} \\\\subseteq S$, $S$ must contain 1,2,3,4. But then it contains 1 and 4 → forbidden by first rule, and 2 and 3 → forbidden by second. So it's already excluded.\\n\\nTherefore, the only constraints we need are:\\n- $S$ cannot contain both 1 and 4\\n- $S$ cannot contain both 2 and 3\\n\\nAnd $S$ must contain 5, and be a subset of $\\\\{1,2,3,4,5\\\\}$.\\n\\nNow, total subsets with 5 and elements from $\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$: $2^4 = 16$\\n\\nNow subtract those that violate the conditions.\\n\\nLet’s count how many subsets $A \\\\subseteq \\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\}$ such that:\\n- $1 \\\\in A$ and $4 \\\\in A$, OR\\n- $2 \\\\in A$ and $3 \\\\in A$\\n\\nUse inclusion-exclusion.\\n\\nLet:\\n- $X$: subsets with 1 and 4\\n- $Y$: subsets with 2 and 3\\n\\nWe want $|X \\\\cup Y| = |X| + |Y| - |X \\\\cap Y|$\\n\\n- $|X|$: fix 1 and 4 in, 2 and 3 free → $2^2 = 4$\\n- $|Y|$: fix 2 and 3 in, 1 and 4 free → $2^2 = 4$\\n- $|X \\\\cap Y|$: 1,4,2,3 all in → only 1 subset (all four)\\n\\nSo $|X \\\\cup Y| = 4 + 4 - 1 = 7$\\n\\nThus, number of $A$ that are **bad** (lead to a subset summing to 10) is 7\\n\\nTotal $A$: 16\\n\\nSo good $A$: $16 - 7 = 9$\\n\\nEach gives a valid $S = A \\\\cup \\\\{5\\\\}$, all non-empty (since 5 is included)\\n\\nSo $N_5 = 9$\\n\\nThen $k = N_5 - 8 = 9 - 8 = 1$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Solve for number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ of nonnegative integers such that:\\n$$\\n(ab + k)(bc + k)(ca + k) = 84\\n$$\\nWith $k = 1$, so:\\n$$\\n(ab + 1)(bc + 1)(ca + 1) = 84\\n$$\\n\\nWe need to find the number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ of nonnegative integers satisfying this.\\n\\nLet:\\n- $x = ab + 1$\\n- $y = bc + 1$\\n- $z = ca + 1$\\n\\nThen $x y z = 84$\\n\\nNote: $x,y,z \\\\geq 1$, since $ab \\\\geq 0$, so $ab+1 \\\\geq 1$, etc.\\n\\nAlso, $a,b,c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_{\\\\geq 0}$\\n\\nWe need to find all such triples $(a,b,c)$ such that the product is 84.\\n\\nIdea: iterate over factorizations of 84 into three positive integers.\\n\\nFirst, factorize 84:\\n$$\\n84 = 2^2 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 7\\n$$\\nNumber of positive divisors: $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 3\\\\cdot2\\\\cdot2 = 12$\\n\\nList all ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ such that $x y z = 84$, $x,y,z \\\\geq 1$\\n\\nBut instead of listing all 12×... we can loop over possible values.\\n\\nBut better: since $x = ab+1$, $y = bc+1$, $z = ca+1$, and $a,b,c \\\\geq 0$, we can try small values.\\n\\nNote that if any of $a,b,c$ is 0, say $a=0$, then:\\n- $x = ab + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$\\n- $z = ca + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$\\n- $y = bc + 1 = b c + 1$\\nThen $x y z = 1 \\\\cdot y \\\\cdot 1 = y = 84$ → so $y = 84$\\nSo $bc + 1 = 84$ → $bc = 83$\\n83 is prime, so solutions:\\n- $b=1, c=83$\\n- $b=83, c=1$\\n- $b=83, c=1$ etc.\\nBut $a=0$, so:\\n- $(a,b,c) = (0,1,83), (0,83,1)$\\nSimilarly, if $b=0$:\\n- $x = ab+1 = 1$\\n- $y = bc+1 = 1$\\n- $z = ca+1 = ca+1$\\nThen $xyz = 1*1*z = z = 84$ → $ca = 83$\\nSo $(c,a) = (1,83), (83,1)$ → $(a,b,c) = (83,0,1), (1,0,83)$\\nIf $c=0$:\\n- $y = bc+1 = 1$\\n- $z = ca+1 = 1$\\n- $x = ab+1$\\nThen $x = 84$ → $ab = 83$\\nSo $(a,b) = (1,83), (83,1)$ → $(a,b,c) = (1,83,0), (83,1,0)$\\nSo far, when one variable is 0, we get:\\n- $a=0$: two solutions: $(0,1,83), (0,83,1)$\\n- $b=0$: two solutions: $(83,0,1), (1,0,83)$\\n- $c=0$: two solutions: $(1,83,0), (83,1,0)$\\nTotal: 6 solutions where one variable is 0.\\n\\nBut wait: are there overlaps? For example, two variables zero?\\nSuppose $a=0, b=0$: then\\n- $x = 0+1=1$\\n- $y = 0+1=1$\\n- $z = 0+1=1$\\nProduct = 1 ≠ 84 → not solution\\nSimilarly, any two zeros give product 1 → not 84\\nAll three zero: same\\nSo no overlap\\n\\nNow, consider cases where none are zero: $a,b,c \\\\geq 1$\\nThen $ab \\\\geq 1$, so $x = ab+1 \\\\geq 2$\\nSimilarly $y \\\\geq 2$, $z \\\\geq 2$\\nSo $x,y,z \\\\geq 2$, and $xyz=84$\\nFactorize 84 with each factor ≥2\\n\\nList all ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ of integers ≥2 such that $xyz=84$\\nFirst, list unordered, then count permutations.\\n\\nFind all triples of integers ≥2 multiplying to 84.\\n\\nStart with $x \\\\leq y \\\\leq z$, $x y z = 84$, $x \\\\geq 2$\\n\\nTry $x=2$:\\nThen $y z = 42$, $y \\\\geq 2$, $z \\\\geq y$\\n- $y=2$, $z=21$\\n- $y=3$, $z=14$\\n- $y=6$, $z=7$\\n- $y=7$, $z=6$ → but $z < y$, skip since we assume $y \\\\leq z$\\nSo up to $y \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{42} \\\\approx 6.48$, so $y \\\\leq 6$\\nSo: (2,2,21), (2,3,14), (2,6,7)\\n\\n$x=3$:\\n$y z = 28$, $y \\\\geq 3$, $z \\\\geq y$\\n- $y=4$, $z=7$\\n- $y=7$, $z=4$ → invalid\\n- $y=2$ → but $y \\\\geq x=3$, so start at 3\\n$y=3$: $z=28/3$ not int\\n$y=4$: $z=7$ ✓\\n$y=7$: $z=4 < y$ → stop\\nSo (3,4,7)\\n\\n$x=4$:\\n$y z = 21$, $y \\\\geq 4$, $z \\\\geq y$\\n$y=3$: too small\\n$y=4$: $z=21/4$ not int\\n$y=7$: $z=3 < y$ → no\\nNo solution\\n\\n$x=6$:\\n$y z = 14$, $y \\\\geq 6$, $z \\\\geq y$\\n$y=7$: $z=2 < y$ → no\\n$y=6$: $z=14/6$ not int\\nNo\\n\\n$x=7$: $yz=12$, $y\\\\geq7$, $z\\\\geq y$ → $y\\\\geq7$, $z\\\\geq7$, $yz\\\\geq49 >12$ → impossible\\n\\nSo only possibilities with $x\\\\leq y\\\\leq z$:\\n- (2,2,21)\\n- (2,3,14)\\n- (2,6,7)\\n- (3,4,7)\\n\\nNow consider all permutations of these.\\n\\n1. (2,2,21): numbers not distinct, two 2's\\nNumber of distinct permutations: 3 (positions for 21)\\n- (2,2,21), (2,21,2), (21,2,2)\\n\\n2. (2,3,14): all distinct → 6 permutations\\n\\n3. (2,6,7): all distinct → 6 permutations\\n\\n4. (3,4,7): all distinct → 6 permutations\\n\\nTotal ordered triples: 3 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 21\\n\\nBut not all may correspond to integer solutions $(a,b,c)$\\n\\nFor each such $(x,y,z)$, we have:\\n- $ab = x - 1$\\n- $bc = y - 1$\\n- $ca = z - 1$\\n\\nAnd $a,b,c \\\\geq 1$\\n\\nWe can solve for $a,b,c$:\\nFrom $ab = p$, $bc = q$, $ca = r$, then multiplying: $(abc)^2 = p q r$ → $abc = \\\\sqrt{p q r}$\\nBut easier: $a = \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{ab \\\\cdot ca}{bc} } = \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{p r}{q} }$\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nBut we need $a,b,c$ to be integers.\\n\\nSo for each $(x,y,z)$, compute:\\n- $p = x-1$, $q = y-1$, $r = z-1$\\nThen check if $a = \\\\sqrt{(p r)/q}$ is integer, etc.\\n\\nBut since $ab = p$, $bc = q$, $ca = r$, then:\\n$$(ab)(bc)(ca) = p q r = a^2 b^2 c^2 \\\\Rightarrow (abc)^2 = p q r$$\\nSo $abc = \\\\sqrt{p q r}$, must be integer.\\nThen $a = abc / (bc) = \\\\sqrt{p q r} / q$, etc.\\n\\nBut perhaps just test each case.\\n\\nLet’s go through each type.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Case 1: (x,y,z) = permutations of (2,2,21)**\\nThen:\\n- $ab+1 = 2$ → $ab = 1$\\n- $bc+1 = 2$ → $bc = 1$\\n- $ca+1 = 21$ → $ca = 20$\\n\\nSince $a,b,c \\\\geq 1$, $ab=1$ → $a=1,b=1$\\nThen $bc=1$ → $c=1$\\nThen $ca = 1*1 = 1 \\\\neq 20$ → contradiction\\n\\nSimilarly, any permutation:\\nSuppose $(x,y,z) = (2,2,21)$ → same as above\\n$(2,21,2)$: then\\n- $ab=1$ → $a=1,b=1$\\n- $bc=20$\\n- $ca=1$\\nFrom $a=1$, $ca=1$ → $c=1$\\nThen $bc = b*1 =1 \\\\neq 20$ → contradiction\\nSimilarly, $(21,2,2)$:\\n- $ab=20$\\n- $bc=1$ → $b=1,c=1$\\n- $ca=1$ → $c=1,a=1$ → $a=1$\\nThen $ab=1*1=1 \\\\neq 20$ → contradiction\\nSo no solutions in this case.\\n\\n**Case 2: permutations of (2,3,14)**\\nSo $x,y,z$ are 2,3,14 in some order\\nThen $ab+1, bc+1, ca+1$ are 2,3,14\\nSo $ab, bc, ca$ are 1,2,13\\n\\nNow, $ab=1,2,$ or $13$\\nBut $ab=1$ → $a=b=1$\\nSimilarly, $bc=1$ → $b=c=1$, etc.\\n\\nTry assigning:\\nSubcase: $ab=1$ → $a=1,b=1$\\nThen $bc = b c = 1*c = c$\\n$ca = c*1 = c$\\nSo $bc = ca = c$\\nBut $bc$ and $ca$ should be two of {2,13}, but they are equal, so unless 2=13, impossible.\\nSimilarly, if $bc=1$ → $b=1,c=1$\\nThen $ab=a$, $ca=a$ → $ab=ca$, but should be 2 and 13 → contradiction\\nIf $ca=1$ → $c=1,a=1$\\nThen $ab=b$, $bc=b$ → $ab=bc$, again must be 2 and 13 → contradiction\\nThus, no solution in this case.\\n\\n**Case 3: permutations of (2,6,7)**\\nThen $ab,bc,ca$ are 1,5,6\\nAgain, one of them is 1.\\nSay $ab=1$ → $a=1,b=1$\\nThen $bc = c$, $ca = c$ → $bc=ca$, but should be 5 and 6 → contradiction\\nSimilarly, if $bc=1$ → $b=1,c=1$ → $ab=a$, $ca=a$ → equal, but 5≠6\\nSame for $ca=1$\\nSo no solution\\n\\n**Case 4: permutations of (3,4,7)**\\nThen $ab+1, bc+1, ca+1$ are 3,4,7 → so $ab,bc,ca$ are 2,3,6\\nAll ≥2, so possible.\\n\\nNow, $ab, bc, ca \\\\in \\\\{2,3,6\\\\}$\\n\\nWe need to assign which is which.\\n\\nNote: $(ab)(bc)(ca) = a^2 b^2 c^2 = (abc)^2 = 2*3*6 = 36$ → $abc = 6$ (since a,b,c ≥1)\\n\\nThen:\\n- $a = abc / (bc) = 6 / (bc)$\\n- $b = abc / (ac) = 6 / (ca)$\\n- $c = abc / (ab) = 6 / (ab)$\\n\\nSo $a = 6 / (bc)$, etc.\\n\\nNow, $bc$ is one of 2,3,6\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nLet’s try all 6 permutations.\\n\\n**(i) $ab=2$, $bc=3$, $ca=6$**\\nThen:\\n- $a = 6 / bc = 6/3 = 2$\\n- $b = 6 / ca = 6/6 = 1$\\n- $c = 6 / ab = 6/2 = 3$\\nCheck:\\n- $ab = 2*1 = 2$ ✓\\n- $bc = 1*3 = 3$ ✓\\n- $ca = 3*2 = 6$ ✓\\nGood.\\nSo $(a,b,c) = (2,1,3)$\\n\\n**(ii) $ab=2$, $bc=6$, $ca=3$**\\nThen:\\n- $a = 6 / bc = 6/6 = 1$\\n- $b = 6 / ca = 6/3 = 2$\\n- $c = 6 / ab = 6/2 = 3$\\nCheck:\\n- $ab = 1*2 = 2$ ✓\\n- $bc = 2*3 = 6$ ✓\\n- $ca = 3*1 = 3$ ✓\\nGood: $(1,2,3)$\\n\\n**(iii) $ab=3$, $bc=2$, $ca=6$**\\n- $a = 6 / bc = 6/2 = 3$\\n- $b = 6 / ca = 6/6 = 1$\\n- $c = 6 / ab = 6/3 = 2$\\nCheck:\\n- $ab = 3*1 = 3$ ✓\\n- $bc = 1*2 = 2$ ✓\\n- $ca = 2*3 = 6$ ✓\\nGood: $(3,1,2)$\\n\\n**(iv) $ab=3$, $bc=6$, $ca=2$**\\n- $a = 6 / bc = 6/6 = 1$\\n- $b = 6 / ca = 6/2 = 3$\\n- $c = 6 / ab = 6/3 = 2$\\nCheck:\\n- $ab = 1*3 = 3$ ✓\\n- $bc = 3*2 = 6$ ✓\\n- $ca = 2*1 = 2$ ✓\\nGood: $(1,3,2)$\\n\\n**(v) $ab=6$, $bc=2$, $ca=3$**\\n- $a = 6 / bc = 6/2 = 3$\\n- $b = 6 / ca = 6/3 = 2$\\n- $c = 6 / ab = 6/6 = 1$\\nCheck:\\n- $ab = 3*2 = 6$ ✓\\n- $bc = 2*1 = 2$ ✓\\n- $ca = 1*3 = 3$ ✓\\nGood: $(3,2,1)$\\n\\n**(vi) $ab=6$, $bc=3$, $ca=2$**\\n- $a = 6 / bc = 6/3 = 2$\\n- $b = 6 / ca = 6/2 = 3$\\n- $c = 6 / ab = 6/6 = 1$\\nCheck:\\n- $ab = 2*3 = 6$ ✓\\n- $bc = 3*1 = 3$ ✓\\n- $ca = 1*2 = 2$ ✓\\nGood: $(2,3,1)$\\n\\nSo all six permutations work!\\n\\nThus, we have 6 solutions with $a,b,c \\\\geq 1$:\\n- (2,1,3), (1,2,3), (3,1,2), (1,3,2), (3,2,1), (2,3,1)\\n\\nEarlier, we had 6 solutions where one variable is 0:\\n- (0,1,83), (0,83,1)\\n- (83,0,1), (1,0,83)\\n- (1,83,0), (83,1,0)\\n\\nAre there any more?\\n\\nWe assumed either one variable is 0, or all ≥1.\\nWe covered all cases.\\n\\nBut wait: could two variables be zero?

(3,2,1)\\n\\nYes, 12 solutions.\\n\\nBut wait: in the all-nonzero case, we have six.\\nIn the one-zero case, six.\\nTotal 12.\\n\\nBut let me double-check one of the one-zero cases.\\nTake (0,1,83):\\n- $ab +1 = 0*1 +1 =1$\\n- $bc +1 =1*83 +1=84$\\n- $ca +1=83*0 +1=1$\\nProduct: $1*84*1=84$ ✓\\nSimilarly, (1,2,3):\\n- $ab+1=2+1=3$\\n- $bc+1=6+1=7$\\n- $ca+1=3+1=4$\\nProduct: $3*7*4=84$ ✓\\n\\nAll good.\\n\\nSo total number of ordered triples is 12.\\n\\nBut wait: are there more solutions where, say, $ab+1=1$, but $a=0$, $b$ arbitrary? We considered only when exactly one is zero, but in that case, if $a=0$, then $ab+1=1$, $ca+1=1$, so $xyz = y$, so $y=84$, so $bc+1=84$, $bc=83$, and since 83 prime, only (b,c)=(1,83),(83,1)\\nSo only two solutions when $a=0$\\nSimilarly for others.\\nSo no more.\\n\\nCould $ab+1=84$, $bc+1=1$, $ca+1=1$? That would require $bc=0$, $ca=0$\\n$bc=0$ → $b=0$ or $c=0$\\n$ca=0$ → $c=0$ or $a=0$\\nBut $ab+1=84$ → $ab=83$\\nSo $a,b \\\\geq 1$\\nThen $ca=0$ → since $a \\\\geq 1$, must have $c=0$\\nSimilarly $bc=0$ → $b \\\\geq 1$, so $c=0$ ✓\\nSo $c=0$, $ab=83$\\nThen:\\n- $ab+1=84$\\n- $bc+1=0+1=1$\\n- $ca+1=0+1=1$\\nProduct: 84*1*1=84 ✓\\nThis is exactly the case when $c=0$, $ab=83$, which we already have: $(a,b,c) = (1,83,0), (83,1,0)$\\nSimilarly for others.\\nSo no new solutions.\\n\\nThus, total 12 ordered triples.\\n\\nBut wait: in the all-nonzero case, we found 6, and in one-variable-zero case, 6, total 12.\\n\\nBut earlier I thought 6 in zero case, but let me recount:\\n- $a=0$: two solutions\\n- $b=0$: two solutions\\n- $c=0$: two solutions\\nTotal 6\\nNonzero: 6\\nSum: 12\\n\\nBut is (1,2,3) different from (1,3,2)? Yes, ordered triples.\\n\\nSo answer is 12.\\n\\nBut let me see if there are more in the nonzero case.\\nWe had only the (3,4,7) permutations, and all worked.\\nThe others had a 1 in the products, leading to contradiction because two products became equal.\\nSo only 6 nonzero solutions.\\n\\nThus, total number is 12.\\n\\nBut wait: what if $a=b=c$?\\nSuppose $a=b=c$, then $(a^2+1)^3 = 84$\\n$a^2+1 = \\\\sqrt[3]{84} \\\\approx 4.38$, not integer, so no.\\n\\nOr other values? I think we covered all factorizations.\\n\\nAnother way: since $x,y,z \\\\geq 1$, $xyz=84$, and for each, we can solve, but we did systematic.\\n\\nSo final answer: 12\",\n    \"answer\": \"12\"\n}",
