  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given a complex problem involving animals in a circle and then a geometric configuration of points. Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\n### Step 1: Analyze the animal arrangement\\n\\nFarmer Bill has 1000 animals: ducks, cows, and rabbits. \\n- Total animals: 1000\\n- Ducks: 600\\n- So, cows + rabbits = 400\\n\\nLet:\\n- D = 600 (ducks)\\n- C = number of cows\\n- R = number of rabbits\\nSo, C + R = 400 → R = 400 - C\\n\\nCondition: Every duck must either be:\\n1. Standing next to at least one cow, OR\\n2. Between two rabbits (i.e., both neighbors are rabbits)\\n\\nWe are to **minimize the number of cows** such that this condition is possible.\\nThen, define k = r - 198, where r is the number of rabbits in the arrangement achieving this minimum.\\nThen use k to solve a geometry problem.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Minimize C (number of cows)\\n\\nWe want as few cows as possible, so we want to maximize the number of ducks that satisfy condition (2): being between two rabbits.\\n\\nBut only ducks can be between two rabbits — but rabbits are only 400 - C in number.\\n\\nNote: The animals are in a **circle**, so every animal has two neighbors.\\n\\nLet’s denote:\\n- A duck is \\\"safe\\\" if it is adjacent to at least one cow OR is between two rabbits.\\n\\nOur goal: ensure all 600 ducks are safe, with minimal C.\\n\\nLet’s suppose we try to make as many ducks as possible safe via being between two rabbits.\\n\\nLet’s define:\\n- Let X be the number of ducks that are between two rabbits.\\nEach such duck requires both neighbors to be rabbits.\\n\\nBut rabbits are limited: only R = 400 - C of them.\\n\\nCan we cluster rabbits to protect multiple ducks?\\n\\nSuppose we have a block like: R, D, D, ..., D, R — but for a duck to be between two rabbits, both its left and right must be rabbits.\\nSo the only way a duck is between two rabbits is if the configuration is: R, D, R.\\nBecause in a circle, each duck has two neighbors.\\n\\nWait! “Between two rabbits” means: the duck has a rabbit on the left and a rabbit on the right.\\nSo the local configuration must be: ... R, D, R ...\\nThat is, the duck is surrounded by two rabbits.\\n\\nBut note: if you have R-D-R, then the middle D is between two rabbits.\\nBut now, can two such ducks share rabbits?\\nSuppose: R, D, R, D, R — then the first D has R on both sides? No: first D has R and R? Wait:\\nPositions: 1:R, 2:D, 3:R, 4:D, 5:R\\nDuck at 2: neighbors R and R → good\\nDuck at 4: neighbors R and R → good\\nSo both ducks are between two rabbits.\\nBut they don't share both rabbits; each uses two rabbits, but the middle R is shared.\\n\\nSequence: R D R D R → uses 3 rabbits and protects 2 ducks.\\nSo 3 rabbits protect 2 ducks.\\nSimilarly, R D R D R D R → 4 ducks? No: positions:\\n1:R, 2:D, 3:R, 4:D, 5:R, 6:D, 7:R\\nDucks at 2,4,6\\nDuck 2: R,R → good\\nDuck 4: R,R → good\\nDuck 6: R,R → good\\nSo 3 rabbits used per 2 ducks? Wait: here 4 rabbits? Wait no: 1,3,5,7 → 4 rabbits protect 3 ducks.\\nPattern: To have m ducks each between two rabbits, we need alternating R and D starting and ending with R.\\nSo sequence: R D R D R ... D R → starts and ends with R, alternates.\\nNumber of R's = m + 1\\nNumber of D's = m\\nBecause: R D R D R → 3 R, 2 D\\nSo m ducks protected this way require m+1 rabbits.\\n\\nThus, to protect m ducks via being between two rabbits, we need m+1 consecutive rabbits in an alternating pattern? Not necessarily consecutive in value, but arranged as R D R D ... R.\\nBut these blocks must be isolated? Because if two such blocks are adjacent, they might interfere.\\nBut more importantly, the entire circle has fixed numbers.\\n\\nBut note: such a block R D R D R uses rabbits and ducks. Each such block of m ducks protected by rabbit-neighbors requires m+1 rabbits and m ducks.\\nBut our ducks are already fixed at 600, and we’re trying to protect them.\\n\\nBut here's a key point: if a duck is in such a block (e.g., R D R), it is protected without needing a cow.\\nBut if not, it must be adjacent to at least one cow.\\n\\nTo minimize cows, we want to maximize the number of ducks that are either:\\n- In R-D-R configurations, or\\n- Part of longer alternating R-D-R-D-R chains\\n\\nBut from above, a maximal block of alternating R and D starting and ending with R: R D R D ... R\\nIf there are m ducks in such a block, there are m+1 rabbits.\\nAnd each duck in the block is between two rabbits? Only if both neighbors are rabbits.\\nIn R D R D R:\\n- First D: neighbors R and R → yes\\n- Second D: neighbors R and R → yes\\nYes, because each D is between two R's.\\nWait: in R D R D R, the first D is between R and R (positions 1,2,3: R,D,R), second D is between R and R (positions 3,4,5: R,D,R) — yes, both ducks are between two rabbits.\\nSo each duck in such a block is protected.\\nAnd such a block with m ducks uses m+1 rabbits.\\nSo efficiency: m ducks protected with m+1 rabbits → ratio ducks/rabbits = m/(m+1)\\nAs m increases, approaches 1.\\nMax when m large.\\n\\nBut rabbits are limited: R = 400 - C\\nWe want to minimize C, so maximize R, but we are trying to minimize C, so we want to use rabbits efficiently to protect ducks without cows.\\nBut more rabbits mean fewer cows, but R = 400 - C, so to minimize C, we maximize R.\\nWait: we are to **minimize C**, the number of cows.\\nSo we want as few cows as possible.\\nThat means we want to use rabbits to protect as many ducks as possible, so that fewer ducks need to be adjacent to cows.\\n\\nSo let’s suppose we form one big block of alternating R and D: R D R D ... R, with m ducks and m+1 rabbits.\\nTotal rabbits used: m+1 ≤ R = 400 - C\\nSo m ≤ 399 - C\\nThen number of ducks protected by rabbit-pairing: m\\nRemaining ducks: 600 - m\\nThese remaining ducks must each be adjacent to at least one cow.\\n\\nNow, the remaining ducks may be adjacent to cows.\\nBut also, the rabbits and cows themselves don't have constraints — only ducks do.\\n\\nNow, the remaining 600 - m ducks must each have at least one cow neighbor.\\nEach cow has two neighbors, so can “cover” up to two ducks (if both neighbors are ducks that need coverage).\\nBut a cow might be adjacent to rabbits or other cows, so might cover fewer than 2 ducks.\\nTo minimize the number of cows, we want each cow to cover as many ducks as possible.\\nMaximum: 2 ducks per cow.\\nSo to cover U ducks, we need at least ⌈U/2⌉ cows.\\nBut wait: the cows we use for covering might be the same as those counted in C.\\nYes, C is total cows.\\n\\nBut in our setup, we have:\\n- Rabbits: R = 400 - C\\n- We use some rabbits in the alternating block: m+1\\nSo we need m+1 ≤ R = 400 - C → m ≤ 399 - C\\nThen unprotected ducks: 600 - m\\nThese must be covered by adjacency to cows.\\nEach such duck must have at least one cow neighbor.\\nEach cow can be neighbor to at most 2 ducks.\\nSo the number of “duck-coverings” a cow can provide is at most 2.\\nThus, to cover 600 - m ducks, we need at least ⌈(600 - m)/2⌉ cows, but actually, since each cow can help at most 2 ducks, we need:\\nC ≥ ⌈(600 - m)/2⌉ ?\\nNot exactly: because the covering is about edges: each duck needs at least one cow adjacent, so sum over ducks of “cow neighbors” ≥ number of uncovered ducks.\\nEach cow contributes at most 2 to this sum (since two neighbors).\\nSo total “cow-adjacency slots” ≤ 2C\\nAnd we need at least (600 - m) such adjacencies (one per uncovered duck)\\nSo:\\n2C ≥ 600 - m\\n→ C ≥ (600 - m)/2\\n\\nAlso, from earlier:\\nm ≤ 399 - C  (since m+1 ≤ 400 - C)\\n\\nWe want to minimize C, so let’s set up inequalities.\\nWe have:\\n1. C ≥ (600 - m)/2\\n2. m ≤ 399 - C\\n\\nSubstitute.\\nFrom (2): m ≤ 399 - C → C ≤ 399 - m\\nFrom (1): C ≥ (600 - m)/2\\nSo:\\n(600 - m)/2 ≤ C ≤ 399 - m\\nThus:\\n(600 - m)/2 ≤ 399 - m\\nMultiply both sides by 2:\\n600 - m ≤ 798 - 2m\\n→ -m + 2m ≤ 798 - 600\\n→ m ≤ 198\\n\\nSo maximum m is 198.\\nThen from (1): C ≥ (600 - 198)/2 = 402/2 = 201\\nFrom (2): m ≤ 399 - C → 198 ≤ 399 - C → C ≤ 201\\nThus C ≥ 201 and C ≤ 201 → C = 201\\nThen R = 400 - C = 199\\nAnd m = 198\\nCheck: m+1 = 199 rabbits used in the block → exactly all rabbits.\\nSo we use all 199 rabbits in a block: R D R D ... R with m=198 ducks and 199 rabbits.\\nThis protects 198 ducks.\\nRemaining ducks: 600 - 198 = 402\\nThese must be covered by cow adjacencies.\\nC = 201 cows.\\nTotal “adjacency slots” from cows: 2*201 = 402\\nWe need 402 coverings (one per uncovered duck), so we need exactly 402, which matches.\\nThus, it is possible if we can arrange the remaining 402 ducks and 201 cows such that each of the 402 ducks is adjacent to at least one cow, and the total cow-duck adjacencies sum to 402.\\nSince 2*201 = 402, this means every cow must be adjacent to two ducks, and no cow-cow or cow-rabbit adjacencies that waste slots.\\nBut the rabbit block is R D R D ... R — it ends with R.\\nThe rest of the circle: we have 402 ducks and 201 cows to place, plus the rabbit block takes 198 + 199 = 397 animals.\\nTotal animals: 1000\\nSo remaining: 1000 - 397 = 603 animals: 402 ducks and 201 cows? 402+201=603, yes.\\nNow, the rabbit block ends with a rabbit. This rabbit has a neighbor on the left (in the block) and on the right (the next animal in circle).\\nSimilarly, the start of the block has a duck on the right.\\nTo avoid wasting cow adjacency, we should not have a cow adjacent to the rabbit block, because that would use a cow slot to be next to a rabbit, but that adjacency doesn't help any duck.\\nBut the rabbit at the end of the block has a neighbor outside the block.\\nIf that neighbor is a cow, then that cow has one neighbor as rabbit, so only one slot left for a duck.\\nBut we need full efficiency: each cow must cover two ducks.\\nSo if any cow is adjacent to a rabbit or another cow, it covers fewer than 2 ducks.\\nBut we have exactly 402 duck-coverings needed and 402 available, so every adjacency from a cow must be to a duck.\\nThus, no cow can be adjacent to a rabbit or another cow.\\nTherefore, all cow neighbors must be ducks.\\nMoreover, since the rabbit block has rabbits at both ends (it starts and ends with R), the animals adjacent to the block (on both sides) will be adjacent to rabbits.\\nIf we place a cow next to a rabbit, that cow has one neighbor as rabbit, so only one duck neighbor possible, so can cover at most one duck.\\nBut we need each cow to cover two ducks, so impossible.\\nContradiction?\\n\\nAh, problem: the circular arrangement means the rabbit block is connected to the rest on both ends.\\nSpecifically, the first animal of the block is R, last is R.\\nSo the predecessor and successor of the block are adjacent to rabbits.\\nIf any of those are cows, then those cows have a rabbit neighbor, so cannot have two duck neighbors.\\nBut we need all 201 cows to have two duck neighbors each.\\nImpossible if any cow is adjacent to a rabbit.\\nTherefore, to prevent that, the neighbors of the rabbit block must not be cows.\\nBut what can they be? The remaining animals are 402 ducks and 201 cows.\\nSo the neighbors must be ducks.\\nSo we must have: ... D, [R D R ... D R], D ...\\nSo the rabbit block is surrounded by ducks on both ends.\\nThen the first R has a duck on the left (outside), and the last R has a duck on the right (outside).\\nNow, the rabbit block itself: internal structure is fine.\\nNow, the rest: 402 ducks and 201 cows, but we've already placed two ducks adjacent to the rabbit block? No: those two ducks are part of the 402.\\nActually, the 402 ducks include all ducks not in the alternating block.\\nSo we can place two of them adjacent to the rabbit block.\\nNow, the issue is: can we arrange the 402 ducks and 201 cows in the remaining arc such that:\\n- All cows are only adjacent to ducks (no cow-cow or cow-rabbit)\\n- And each of the 402 ducks is adjacent to at least one cow\\n- And the whole thing connects properly\\n\\nMoreover, since the rabbit block is flanked by ducks, and those ducks are part of the 402, and they need to be covered (i.e., each must have a cow neighbor).\\nNow, consider the segment: we have a sequence of 603 animals: 402 ducks and 201 cows, forming an arc between the two ends of the rabbit block.\\nAt both ends of this arc, it is adjacent to a rabbit (from the block), but the first and last animals of this arc are ducks (as we decided).\\nSo the arc starts and ends with a duck, and these ducks are adjacent to rabbits.\\nBut that's ok, as long as each such duck is also adjacent to a cow.\\nNow, within this arc, we need to place 402 ducks and 201 cows.\\nTotal positions: 603\\nWe need every duck to have at least one cow neighbor.\\nAnd we need to minimize wasted cow adjacencies.\\nBut we have exactly 2*201 = 402 cow-adjacency slots.\\nEach must be used to cover a duck.\\nSince there are 402 ducks to cover, and 402 slots, each duck must receive exactly one cow-adjacency, and each cow-adjacency goes to a duck.\\nMoreover, no cow can be adjacent to a non-duck (i.e., no cow-cow or cow-rabbit), but cow-rabbit is already avoided since only ducks and cows in this arc, and cows not at ends? But the arc is bounded by ducks, but internally could have cow-cow.\\nBut if two cows are adjacent, then each has a neighbor that is a cow, so that adjacency doesn't cover a duck.\\nBut we have only 402 duck-coverings available, and 402 ducks to cover, so if any adjacency is cow-cow, then total duck-coverings < 402, contradiction.\\nSimilarly, if a cow is at the end, but the ends are ducks, so no cow at end.\\nAll positions in arc are filled, first and last are ducks.\\nSo no cow is adjacent to a rabbit.\\nBut cows could be adjacent to each other.\\nIf two cows are adjacent, say ... C C ..., then the edge between them is a cow-cow adjacency, which does not contribute to covering any duck.\\nBut each such adjacency wastes one “slot”.\\nEach cow has two neighbors.\\nIf a cow is between two ducks: D C D, then both neighbors are ducks, so it covers two ducks.\\nIf a cow is at the edge but not: the arc starts and ends with duck, so a cow could be second: D C ..., then neighbors: D and whatever.\\nIf it's D C D, still good.\\nOnly if two cows together: e.g., D C C D\\nThen first C: neighbors D and C → covers one duck\\nSecond C: neighbors C and D → covers one duck\\nTogether, two cows cover two ducks, but use two adjacencies to each other, so total duck-coverings: 2, but maximum possible is 4, so efficiency 2/4 = 0.5\\nWhereas two separate cows each between ducks: D C D C D → first C: D,D → covers 2 ducks? Neighbors are D and D, so yes, covers two ducks.\\nBut each duck can be covered by multiple cows, but we only need one covering per duck.\\nIn D C D C D: ducks: three ducks.\\nFirst D: neighbors (left) and C → assuming left is something, but in this subpart: positions: 1:D, 2:C, 3:D, 4:C, 5:D\\nDuck 1: neighbors ? and C → if ? is not cow, but in this case, if isolated, duck 1 has only one neighbor shown: C, so if the other neighbor is not cow, it might not be covered.\\nBut in our case, we need to ensure coverage.\\nBack to point: if we have a cow-cow pair, they cover only two ducks (each covers one duck, since one neighbor is cow), whereas two isolated cows could cover up to four ducks.\\nBut in our case, we have exactly enough capacity: 402 coverings for 402 ducks.\\nSo if there is even one cow-cow adjacency, then total number of duck-covering adjacencies is at most 2C - 2 = 402 - 2 = 400 < 402, since each cow-cow edge wastes two coverings (one from each cow).\\nEach cow-cow edge reduces the total possible duck-coverings by 2.\\nBecause each cow loses one slot to a non-duck.\\nSo if there are E cow-cow adjacencies, then total duck-covering capacity ≤ 2C - 2E\\nWe need ≥ 402\\nBut 2C = 402, so 402 - 2E ≥ 402 → -2E ≥ 0 → E ≤ 0\\nThus E = 0\\nSo no cow-cow adjacencies.\\nSimilarly, no cow-rabbit, but already avoided.\\nTherefore, no two cows can be adjacent.\\nMoreover, since the arc starts and ends with duck, and no two cows adjacent, the cows must be isolated, each separated by ducks.\\nNow, we have 201 cows, each must not be adjacent to another cow.\\nSo between any two cows, at least one duck.\\nAlso, each cow has two neighbors, both must be ducks (since no cow-cow, and no cow-rabbit), so each cow is surrounded by ducks: D C D\\nThus, each cow takes a spot with ducks on both sides.\\nNow, to place 201 such cows, each requiring its own two duck neighbors, but ducks can be shared.\\nFor example, sequence: D C D C D C D ... \\nThis is alternating D and C, starting and ending with D.\\nNumber of cows: k\\nNumber of ducks: k + 1\\nBecause: D C D C D → 3 ducks, 2 cows\\nSo for 201 cows, we need 202 ducks in such a chain.\\nBut we have 402 ducks available in this arc.\\n202 < 402, so plenty.\\nBut we need only 202 ducks to place the 201 cows in an alternating fashion.\\nBut we have 402 ducks, so we have extra 402 - 202 = 200 ducks.\\nThese extra ducks must also be covered, i.e., each must have at least one cow neighbor.\\nBut in the alternating block D C D C ... D, all ducks are already between two cows or at ends.\\nEnd ducks have only one cow neighbor (the adjacent one), and internal ducks have two.\\nBut all have at least one, so they are covered.\\nBut if we add extra ducks, we need to attach them in a way that they get a cow neighbor.\\nBut we cannot add a duck without a cow neighbor.\\nFor example, if we add a duck next to an existing duck: ... D D ..., then the new duck has neighbors: one is D, the other depends.\\nIf it's at the end, and we add D to the end: original end is D, add another D: now the new D has neighbors: the previous D and whatever.\\nIf the previous D was at the end of the alternating block, it had one neighbor (a cow), now it has two: cow and new D.\\nBut the new D has only one neighbor so far (the old D), which is not a cow, so unless the other neighbor is a cow, it won't be covered.\\nBut we have no more cows.\\nAll 201 cows are used.\\nSo we cannot add a duck that is not adjacent to a cow.\\nTherefore, any additional duck must be adjacent to at least one cow.\\nBut all cows already have two neighbors.\\nIn the alternating block D C D C D, each cow has two duck neighbors.\\nIf we try to attach a new duck to a cow, but the cow already has two neighbors, so in the circle, each animal has only two neighbors, so we cannot add a third neighbor.\\nTherefore, we cannot attach any additional duck directly to a cow.\\nThus, the only way to add a duck is to insert it between two existing animals, but that would require breaking the circle or something, but we are arranging in a fixed circle.\\nWe have to place exactly 402 ducks and 201 cows in a linear arc (but it's a circle, but the block is fixed).\\nActually, the entire arrangement is a circle, but we have a contiguous block of 397 animals (199 rabbits and 198 ducks in alternating R D R D ... R), and the remaining 603 animals are in the complementary arc.\\nWe need to arrange these 603 animals: 402 ducks and 201 cows.\\nIf we make a maximal alternating D C D C ... D block, with 201 cows, we need 202 ducks.\\nBut we have 402 ducks, so 200 extra ducks.\\nThese 200 ducks must be placed somewhere in this arc.\\nBut wherever we place them, they must each have at least one cow neighbor.\\nBut all cows are already fully occupied: each has two duck neighbors in the alternating block.\\nSo no cow has a free slot.\\nTherefore, we cannot have any duck that is not already in the neighborhood of a cow.\\nBut if we add a duck, say, between two ducks: ... D D D ..., then the middle D might be ok if it has a cow on one side, but the end ones?\\nSuppose we have a group of several ducks together.\\nFor example, a block of t consecutive ducks.\\nThen the two ducks at the ends of the block have one neighbor inside the block (a duck) and one outside.\\nTo be covered, the outside neighbor must be a cow.\\nThe internal ducks (not at ends) have both neighbors as ducks, so neither is a cow, so they are not adjacent to any cow, so they are not covered.\\nTherefore, in a block of t ducks, only the two at the ends can be covered (if adjacent to cows), but the internal t-2 ducks are not adjacent to any cow, so unless t ≤ 2, there are uncovered ducks.\\nIf t=1: single duck, must have at least one cow neighbor.\\nIf t=2: two ducks together, each has one neighbor duck and one other; to be covered, each must have the other neighbor a cow. So must be between two cows: C D D C, then each duck has one cow neighbor.\\nIf t=3: D D D, to cover all, the first must have left neighbor cow, last must have right neighbor cow, but middle duck has two duck neighbors, so no cow adjacent — not covered.\\nThus, impossible to have three or more consecutive ducks.\\nTherefore, ducks can be in blocks of size at most 2.\\nBlocks of size 1: single duck, must be adjacent to at least one cow.\\nBlocks of size 2: two ducks together, must have both ends adjacent to cows, i.e., surrounded by cows on both sides.\\nNow, back to our arc: we have 402 ducks and 201 cows, and we need to arrange them so that no three ducks in a row, and each duck covered.\\nMoreover, from earlier, to achieve exactly 402 coverings with 402 capacity, we need no wasted adjacencies, so no cow-cow, and no cow adjacent to non-duck, but since only ducks and cows, just no cow-cow.\\nAlso, each cow must have two duck neighbors.\\nSo every cow must be between two ducks: D C D\\nNow, consider the sequence.\\nEach cow is surrounded by ducks.\\nNow, the ducks come in blocks.\\nEach block of ducks must be flanked by cows (except possibly at the ends of the arc, but the arc ends are adjacent to the rabbit block, which has rabbits, so the first and last of the arc are ducks, and they are adjacent to rabbits.\\nSo for the first duck in the arc: neighbors are: the last animal of the rabbit block (which is R) and the next animal in the arc.\\nSimilarly, last duck in arc: neighbors: previous in arc and first animal of rabbit block (R).\\nSo both end ducks have one neighbor as rabbit.\\nTo be covered, they must have their other neighbor (inside the arc) be a cow.\\nSo the second animal in the arc must be a cow, and the second-to-last must be a cow.\\nMoreover, since no cow-cow, the sequence must start: D (end), C, ?\\nSimilarly end: ?, C, D (end)\\nNow, the C after the first D: this cow has neighbors: first D and the next animal.\\nTo have both neighbors ducks, the next animal must be a duck.\\nSo sequence: D, C, D, ...\\nSimilarly, at the end: ..., D, C, D\\nSo it starts D C D and ends D C D\\nNow, continue.\\nAfter D C D, the next could be C or D.\\nIf C, then D C D C, but then the last D has neighbors C and C? Positions: 1:D, 2:C, 3:D, 4:C\\nDuck 3: neighbors C and C → so it has cow neighbors, covered.\\nBut cow 2: neighbors D and D → good\\nCow 4: neighbors D and ?\\nIf next is D, then D C D C D, etc.\\nBut if we have D C D C D, that's five animals: three ducks, two cows.\\nThis is the alternating pattern.\\nCould we have two ducks together?\\nSuppose after D C D, we put another D: D C D D\\nThen duck 3: neighbors C and D\\nDuck 4: neighbors D and ?\\nNow, duck 3 has one cow neighbor (good), duck 4 has one duck neighbor, so to be covered, the next must be a cow.\\nSo D C D D C\\nNow, cow at position 5: neighbors D and ?\\nTo have both neighbors ducks, ? must be duck.\\nSo D C D D C D\\nThen we have a block of two ducks in the middle.\\nCount: ducks: 1,3,4,6 → four ducks\\nCows: 2,5 → two cows\\nSequence: D,C,D,D,C,D\\nNow, check coverings:\\n- Duck 1: neighbors (rabbit) and C → has cow, good\\n- Duck 3: neighbors C and D → has cow, good\\n- Duck 4: neighbors D and C → has cow, good\\n- Duck 6: neighbors C and (next) → if next is rabbit or something, but in arc, next could be more.\\nBut duck 6 has a cow neighbor, so covered.\\nCows: cow 2: neighbors D1 and D3 → both ducks, good\\nCow 5: neighbors D4 and D6 → both ducks, good\\nNo cow-cow.\\nAnd we have a pair of consecutive ducks (3 and 4).\\nIs this efficient? Two cows cover four ducks.\\nEach cow covers two ducks, total four coverings, four ducks, perfect.\\nIn general, a block of two consecutive ducks requires that they are between two cows, but in this case, the two ducks are not isolated; they are part of a larger structure.\\nNotice that in this sequence, we have ducks in groups: single D, then later a pair D D.\\nBut each “internal” duck block must be surrounded by cows.\\nSpecifically, any maximal block of consecutive ducks must be preceded and followed by a cow (except at arc ends, but arc ends are handled).\\nIn the interior, yes.\\nBut in our case, the arc has fixed ends.\\nNow, back to efficiency.\\nEach cow provides two duck-coverings.\\nEach duck requires one covering.\\nSo total balance: 2C = number of coverings = sum over ducks of (number of cow neighbors)\\nSince each duck must have at least one, sum ≥ D_arc = 402\\nBut 2C = 402, so sum = 402, thus each duck has exactly one cow neighbor.\\nTherefore, no duck has two cow neighbors.\\nIn particular, in the alternating pattern D C D C D, the middle duck has two cow neighbors, which would give it two coverings, but we need exactly one per duck, so that would make sum > 402 if there are such ducks.\\nBut we have sum must be exactly 402, so each duck must have exactly one cow neighbor.\\nTherefore, no duck can have two cow neighbors.\\nThus, the alternating pattern is forbidden because internal ducks would have two cow neighbors.\\nSimilarly, in the pair example above: D C D D C D\\nDuck 1: neighbors rabbit and C → only one cow neighbor (C2), good\\nDuck 3: neighbors C2 and D4 → only one cow neighbor (C2), good\\nDuck 4: neighbors D3 and C5 → only one cow neighbor (C5), good\\nDuck 6: neighbors C5 and ? → if ? is not cow, then only one cow neighbor, good\\nBut duck 6 has only one neighbor shown; the other is the next animal.\\nIf the next animal is a cow, then duck 6 has two cow neighbors (C5 and next cow), which would be bad.\\nTo prevent that, the animal after duck 6 must not be a cow.\\nBut if it's a duck, then we have more ducks, and so on.\\nIn this sequence, after D6, if we put a cow, then duck 6 has neighbors C5 and C? , so two cow neighbors, not allowed.\\nIf we put a duck, say D7, then D7 has neighbors D6 and ?, so to be covered, ? must be a cow, and D7 must have a cow neighbor.\\nBut then we need to continue.\\nBut also, the cow after D7 would have neighbors D7 and ?, and to have two duck neighbors, ? must be duck, and so on.\\nBut eventually, we might close or hit the end.\\nBut the key point is that no duck can have two cow neighbors.\\nTherefore, in the entire arrangement, for the duck arc, each duck has exactly one cow neighbor.\\nNow, consider the degrees.\\nEach cow has two duck neighbors.\\nEach duck has exactly one cow neighbor.\\nSo the number of “cow-duck” adjacencies is: sum over cows of (number of duck neighbors) = 2C = 402\\nSum over ducks of (number of cow neighbors) = 1 * 402 = 402\\nConsistent.\\nNow, graph-theoretically, this is a bipartite graph between cows and ducks, with each cow degree 2, each duck degree 1.\\nBut in the circle, the adjacency is along a path (the arc), so it's a path graph with vertices colored as ducks and cows.\\nWe have a path of 603 vertices: v1 to v603, with v1 and v603 being ducks (adjacent to rabbit block).\\nEach vi is D or C.\\nConstraints:\\n- v1 = D, v603 = D\\n- Each duck has exactly one cow neighbor\\n- Each cow has two duck neighbors\\n- No two cows adjacent (because if C-C, then each has a cow neighbor, so cannot have two duck neighbors)\\n- Also, from duck constraint, no duck has two cow neighbors\\nNow, since no two cows adjacent, the cows are isolated, each separated by ducks.\\nConsider a cow at position i.\\nIt has neighbors i-1 and i+1.\\nBoth must be ducks.\\nSo vi-1 = D, vi+1 = D\\nNow, duck at i-1: has neighbors i-2 and i (cow)\\nIt must have exactly one cow neighbor.\\nCurrently, it has one (at i), so it must not have a cow at i-2.\\nThus, vi-2 ≠ C, so vi-2 = D\\nSimilarly, duck at i+1: neighbors i (cow) and i+2\\nMust have exactly one cow neighbor, so i+2 must not be a cow, so vi+2 = D\\nTherefore, around each cow, we must have: D D C D D\\nSpecifically: vi-2 = D, vi-1 = D, vi = C, vi+1 = D, vi+2 = D\\nBut then look at duck at i-1: neighbors vi-2=D and vi=C → one cow neighbor, good\\nDuck at i+1: neighbors vi=C and vi+2=D → one cow neighbor, good\\nBut now, the ducks at i-2 and i+2: each has neighbors including a duck and another.\\nDuck at i-2: neighbors i-3 and i-1=D\\nIt has no cow neighbor yet, so to have exactly one, it must have i-3 = C\\nSimilarly, duck at i+2: neighbors i+1=D and i+3, so must have i+3 = C\\nBut then we need a cow at i-3 and i+3\\nThen similarly, for cow at i-3: it requires vi-5=D, vi-4=D, vi-3=C, vi-2=D, vi-1=D — but vi-2 and vi-1 are already D, good, but now vi-4 must be D, vi-5 must be D, and so on.\\nThis propagates.\\nEssentially, the only way is to have cows spaced every 3 positions? Let's see.\\nSuppose we have a cow at position k.\\nThen we need:\\n- k-2: D\\n- k-1: D\\n- k: C\\n- k+1: D\\n- k+2: D\\nAnd for duck at k-2: to have a cow neighbor, since k-1 is D, not cow, so k-3 must be C\\nSimilarly, k+3 must be C\\nThen for cow at k-3: requires k-5=D, k-4=D, k-3=C, k-2=D, k-1=D — k-2 and k-1 are D, good\\nBut k-4 must be D, k-5 must be D\\nAnd for duck at k-4: neighbors k-5 and k-3=C → has one cow neighbor, good\\nDuck at k-5: neighbors k-6 and k-4=D → no cow neighbor yet, so k-6 must be C\\nAnd so on.\\nSo the pattern is periodic with period 3: ... C, D, D, C, D, D, C, D, D, ... \\nFrom above: cow at k-3, then k-2:D, k-1:D, k:C, k+1:D, k+2:D, k+3:C\\nSo sequence: ..., C, D, D, C, D, D, C, ...\\nSo the pattern is C D D repeating.\\nEach cow is followed by two ducks, then next cow.\\nCheck:\\nPosition i: C\\ni+1: D\\ni+2: D\\ni+3: C\\nNow, cow at i: neighbors i-1 and i+1\\ni+1 is D, good\\ni-1: since i-3 is C, i-2:D, i-1:D, so i-1=D, good\\nSo cow has two duck neighbors.\\nDuck at i+1: neighbors i=C and i+2=D → one cow neighbor, good\\nDuck at i+2: neighbors i+1=D and i+3=C → one cow neighbor, good\\nPerfect.\\nNow, the arc has 603 positions.\\nWe need to place a sequence of C D D repeating.\\nEach block C D D has 3 animals: 1 cow, 2 ducks.\\nNumber of such blocks: let b be the number.\\nThen cows: b\\nDucks: 2b\\nTotal animals: 3b\\nSet 3b = 603 → b = 201\\nThen cows: 201\\nDucks: 402\\nPerfect!\\nAnd the sequence is C D D C D D ... C D D\\nBut it starts with C and ends with D.\\nBut our arc must start with D (since adjacent to rabbit block's R)\\nHere it starts with C, not D.\\nProblem.\\nSimilarly, ends with D, which is good, but starts with C, but we need v1 = D.\\nContradiction.\\nIf we start with D, but the pattern requires that before a C is a D, but the first is C, so no before.\\nWe could shift the pattern.\\nPossible patterns:\\n- C D D C D D ... : starts with C\\n- D C D D C D ... : starts with D, then C, D, D, C, ...\\nBut D C D D: then next should be C, so D C D D C\\nBut after D D, should be C, good.\\nBut look at duck at position 1: D, neighbors ? and C (position 2)\\nIt has one cow neighbor (C2), good\\nDuck at position 3: D, neighbors C2 and D4 → one cow neighbor, good\\nDuck at position 4: D, neighbors D3 and C5 → one cow neighbor, good\\nCow at 2: neighbors D1 and D3 → both ducks, good\\nCow at 5: neighbors D4 and D6 → if D6, good\\nBut the pattern would be: D, C, D, D, C, D, D, C, ... \\nAfter C5, should be D6, D7, C8, etc.\\nBut after C5, we have D6, then D7, then C8\\nBut between C5 and C8, we have D6, D7 — two ducks, good.\\nBut the sequence is: pos1:D, 2:C, 3:D, 4:D, 5:C, 6:D, 7:D, 8:C, ...\\nSo the pattern is D, C, D, D, C, D, D, C, ... \\nAfter the first D, it's C D D repeating.\\nSo overall: D + (C D D) repeated\\nEach (C D D) has 3 animals: 1C, 2D\\nLet there be b such blocks.\\nThen total: 1 + 3b animals\\nCows: b\\nDucks: 1 + 2b\\nSet total animals: 1 + 3b = 603 → 3b = 602 → b = 200.666, not integer.\\nImpossible.\\nStart with D D C: then D D C D D C ...\\nPattern: D D C repeating\\nEach block: 3 animals, 2D, 1C\\nLet b blocks.\\nTotal animals: 3b = 603 → b = 201\\nCows: 201\\nDucks: 402\\nPerfect.\\nSequence: D D C D D C ... D D C\\nStarts with D, ends with C\\nBut our arc must end with D (since last animal adjacent to rabbit block's R)\\nHere it ends with C, not D.\\nProblem.\\nOther possibility: end with D, but this ends with C.\\nSo not good.\\nIs there a pattern that starts and ends with D?\\nFor example, start with D, end with D, and follow the C D D requirement.\\nBut from the local constraint, each cow must have D D on both sides in the sense that the two neighbors are D, and the adjacent ducks require that the next is not C, but in the C D D pattern, it works only if the spacing is regular.\\nPerhaps we can have the pattern in the middle, but adjust ends.\\nBut earlier we derived that to satisfy the degree constraints, the only possibility is the C D D repeating or shifts, but none start and end with D with length 603.\\nList possible:\\n- C D D C D D ... C D D: length 3b, starts C, ends D\\n- D C D D C D ... D C D D: starts D, ends D, but length: first D, then (C D D) repeated b times: total 1 + 3b\\nSet 1+3b=603, 3b=602, not divisible.\\n- D D C D D C ... D D C: starts D D, ends C, length 3b\\n- Or start with C D D ... and end with C D: but not consistent.\\nThe only way to have both start and end with D is the second type: D followed by b blocks of C D D.\\nLength 1 + 3b = 603 → 3b=602 → b=200.666, not integer.\\nSimilarly, if we try to end with D D, but start with D, then D + (C D D)*b + D? Too long.\\nPerhaps the pattern is not pure.\\nBut from the local deduction, around each cow, we must have D D C D D, and this forces the cow at k-3 and k+3, so it must be periodic with period 3.\\nTherefore, the only possibilities are the repeating C D D or shifts.\\nNone have length 603 and start and end with D.\\nFor example, C D D repeated 201 times: length 603, starts with C, ends with D.\\nBut we need starts with D.\\nD C D D C D ... : would be D followed by C D D repeated, but length 1 + 3b, not 603.\\n603 div 3 = 201, so only multiples of 3.\\nThe sequences of period 3 have length multiple of 3, which 603 is.\\nBut the phase must be such that it starts with D.\\nPossible starting points:\\n- Start at C: C D D C D D ... → starts C\\n- Start at D (first D of D D C): D D C D D C ... → starts D, but then the pattern is D D C, which is different.\\nIn D D C D D C, let's check if it satisfies.\\nPos: 1:D, 2:D, 3:C, 4:D, 5:D, 6:C, ...\\nCow at 3: neighbors 2:D and 4:D → good\\nDuck at 1: neighbors ? and 2:D → no cow neighbor yet, so to have a cow neighbor, ? must be C\\nSimilarly, duck at 2: neighbors 1:D and 3:C → has one cow neighbor, good\\nDuck at 4: neighbors 3:C and 5:D → has one cow neighbor, good\\nDuck at 5: neighbors 4:D and 6:C → has one cow neighbor, good\\nSo if the previous animal is C, then duck 1 has a cow neighbor.\\nIn our arc, the previous animal is the last of the rabbit block, which is R, not C.\\nSo duck 1 has neighbors R and D2 → both not cow, so no cow neighbor! Not covered.\\nTherefore, not good.\\nSimilarly, if we start with D C D, but then it might not work.\\nGiven the time, perhaps our initial assumption is wrong.\\nMaybe we can have the rabbit block not using all rabbits, or smaller.\\nEarlier we assumed m=198, C=201, R=199\\nBut perhaps we can have a smaller m, allowing more flexibility.\\nRecall that we had m ≤ 198 from the inequality, and C >=201.\\nBut perhaps with C=201, R=199, we can arrange differently.\\nAnother idea: instead of one big alternating block, have multiple small blocks of R D R, each protecting one duck with two rabbits.\\nFor example, each R D R uses 2 rabbits and 1 duck, protects 1 duck.\\nEfficiency: 1 duck per 2 rabbits.\\nWhereas the long block: m ducks with m+1 rabbits, so for large m, almost 1 per 1.\\nSo better to have large block.\\nWith m=198, 199 rabbits, protect 198 ducks.\\nRemaining 402 ducks need coverage.\\nC=201 cows.\\n2C=402 coverings.\\nNeed 402 coverings for 402 ducks, so each duck must have exactly one cow neighbor, each cow must have two duck neighbors, no waste.\\nNow, for the arc of 603 animals: 402 ducks, 201 cows, must start and end with duck (adjacent to rabbit-block's R).\\nNow, suppose we place the cows such that each is between two ducks, and the duck degrees are controlled.\\nBut from graph theory, the number of cow-duck edges is 2*201 = 402 from cow side, and must be 402 from duck side, so average 1 per duck.\\nSince each duck must have at least 1, and sum is 402, each has exactly 1.\\nSo the adjacency graph has cows with degree 2, ducks with degree 1.\\nThis is only possible if the component is trees or something, but in a path, it's a disjoint union of paths.\\nIn the linear arrangement, the adjacencies are only between consecutive animals.\\nSo the only edges are between i and i+1 for i=1 to 602.\\nEach such edge may be between cow and duck or not.\\nFor each animal, the number of cow neighbors is the number of adjacent animals that are cows.\\nFor a duck at position i, it has neighbors i-1 and i+1 (except ends).\\nSo its number of cow neighbors is the number of {i-1, i+1} that are cows.\\nSimilarly for cows.\\nWe need for each duck, exactly one of its two neighbors is a cow.\\nFor each cow, both neighbors are ducks.\\nNow, let's see the implications.\\nTake a cow at i.\\nThen i-1 and i+1 must be ducks.\\nNow, take the duck at i-1.\\nIt has neighbors i-2 and i.\\ni is cow, so it has at least one cow neighbor.\\nIt must have exactly one, so i-2 must not be a cow, so i-2 is a duck.\\nSimilarly, duck at i+1: neighbors i and i+2, i is cow, so i+2 must not be a cow, so i+2 is a duck.\\nSo again, we have i-2: D, i-1: D, i: C, i+1: D, i+2: D\\nThen duck at i-2: neighbors i-3 and i-1=D\\ni-1 is duck, not cow, so to have a cow neighbor, i-3 must be cow.\\nSimilarly, i+3 must be cow.\\nSo indeed, it forces i-3=C, i+3=C, and so on.\\nSo the only way is the periodic C D D with period 3, but shifted.\\nFor example, positions where index mod 3 = 1: C, then 2: D, 3: D, 1: C, etc.\\nOr other phases.\\nBut for the sequence to start with D, we need at position 1: D.\\nSuppose the pattern is based on i mod 3.\\nOption 1: if i ≡ 1 mod 3: C, i≡2 mod 3: D, i≡0 mod 3: D\\nThen at i=1: 1≡1, so C, but we need D.\\nOption 2: i≡1: D, i≡2: C, i≡0: D\\nThen i=1: D, good; i=2: C, i=3: D, i=4: D? 4≡1: D, so i=4: D, but should be C if following, no, the pattern is i=1:D,2:C,3:D,4:D,5:C,6:D,7:D,... wait no.\\nAccording to this: i=1: D (1≡1), i=2: C (2≡2), i=3: D (3≡0), i=4: D (4≡1), i=5: C (5≡2), i=6: D (6≡0), etc.\\nSo sequence: D, C, D, D, C, D, D, C, D, ... \\nAfter i=3: D, i=4: D, i=5: C, so it's D, C, D, then D, C, D, but i=3 and i=4 both D, then i=5 C.\\nList: 1:D, 2:C, 3:D, 4:D, 5:C, 6:D, 7:D, 8:C, ... \\nSo after the first D C D, it becomes D C D repeating but with extra D? 1:D,2:C,3:D, then 4:D,5:C,6:D, so from 4 on, it's D,C,D, but 3 and 4 are both D, so positions 3 and 4: D D.\\nThe pattern is not consistent.\\nFrom i=2 onwards: C, D, D, C, D, D, C, ... so from position 2: C D D C D D ... with period 3.\\nLength from 2 to 603: 602 positions.\n602 / 3 = 200.666, not integer, so cannot have exact repetition.\n\nThe length is 603.\n603 div 3 = 201.\nSo only if the pattern has period 3 and length multiple of 3.\n\nThe possible period-3 patterns:\n- Type A: C,D,D repeated\n- Type B: D,C,D repeated\n- Type C: D,D,C repeated\n\nType A: starts C, ends D\nType B: starts D, ends D (since 201*3=603, 603≡3≡0 mod 3, if i≡0: D, so ends with D)\nType C: starts D, ends C\n\nSo only type A and type B start with D? Type B starts with D, ends with D.\n\nType B: i≡1 mod 3: D, i≡2 mod 3: C, i≡0 mod 3: D\nSo sequence: 1:D, 2:C, 3:D, 4:D, 5:C, 6:D, 7:D, 8:C, 9:D, ...\n1:D,2:C,3:D,4:D,5:C,6:D,...\nSo it's D,C,D, then D,C,D, but 3:D and 4:D, so after each C is D, but between C's: after C at 2, next is D at 3, then D at 4, then C at 5, so the sequence is D,C,D,D,C,D,D,C,D,... \nPositions: 1:D,2:C,3:D,4:D,5:C,6:D,7:D,8:C,...\nSo it's not D,C,D repeating; rather, it's D, then (C,D,D) repeating? From 2 on: C,D,D,C,D,D,...\n\nFrom position 2 to 603: 602 positions, not divisible by 3.\n\nFor type B: the pattern is periodic with period 3: values repeat every 3: pos1:D, pos2:C, pos3:D, pos4:D (since 4≡1, D), pos5:C (5≡2), pos6:D (6≡0), pos7:D (7≡1), etc.\n\nSo the sequence is: D, C, D, D, C, D, D, C, D, ... \n- When i≡1 mod 3: D\n- i≡2 mod 3: C\n- i≡0 mod 3: D\n\nSo for i=1,4,7,10,... : D\ni=2,5,8,11,... : C\ni=3,6,9,12,... : D\n\nSo the sequence is: D,C,D, D,C,D, D,C,D, ... so it's (D,C,D) repeated.\n\nYes! (D,C,D) every three positions.\n\nSo for b=201 blocks of D,C,D.\n\nEach block: D,C,D — 3 animals, 2 ducks, 1 cow.\n\nSo for 201 blocks: ducks: 2*201=402, cows: 201, perfect.\n\nSequence: (D,C,D) repeated 201 times.\n\nSo starts with D, ends with D (since last of block is D).\n\nNow, check the conditions.\n\nTake a cow: at positions i≡2 mod 3, e.g., i=2,5,8,...\n\nCow at i=2: neighbors i-1=1:D, i+1=3:D → both ducks, good.\n\nDuck at i=1: neighbors: left is the last animal of the rabbit block, which is R, and right is i=2:C.\n\nSo neighbors: R and C.\n\nHas one cow neighbor (C2), so exactly one, good.\n\nDuck at i=3: neighbors i=2:C and i=4:D (since 4≡1, D)\n\nSo neighbors: C and D → one cow neighbor, good.\n\nDuck at i=4: neighbors i=3:D and i=5:C → neighbors D and C → one cow neighbor, good.\n\nSimilarly, any duck at position j:\n\n- If j≡1 mod 3: neighbors j-1 and j+1.\n\nj-1: if j>1, j-1≡0 mod 3, so D; j+1≡2 mod 3, so C.\n\nSo neighbors: D and C → one cow neighbor.\n\nFor j=1: as above, neighbors R and C → one cow neighbor.\n\n- If j≡0 mod 3: j=3,6,9,... neighbors j-1≡2 mod 3: C, j+1≡1 mod 3: D.\n\nSo neighbors: C and D → one cow neighbor.\n\n- If j≡2 mod 3: but j≡2 are cows, not ducks.\n\nSo all ducks have exactly one cow neighbor.\n\nAll cows have two duck neighbors.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnd the arc starts with D and ends with D, adjacent to the rabbit block's R at both ends.\n\nNow, the rabbit block is R D R D ... R with 199 rabbits and 198 ducks.\n\nIt starts with R and ends with R.\n\nSo the circle is: [R D R D ... R] (397 animals) then [ (D C D) repeated 201 times ] (603 animals), but 397+603=1000, good.\n\nThe connection: last of rabbit block is R, first of arc is D, so R-D, good.\n\nLast of arc is D, first of rabbit block is R, so D-R, good.\n\nNo problem.\n\nAnd all conditions satisfied.\n\nTherefore, with C=201 cows, it is possible.\n\nAnd we cannot have fewer, because from earlier inequality, C >=201.\n\nSo minimum cows is 201.\n\nThen R = 400 - 201 = 199 rabbits.\n\nThen k = r - 198 = 199 - 198 = 1.\n\nSo k=1.\n\nNow, the second part: find the largest integer n such that there exists a set of n points in the plane such that for any choice of three of them, some two are distance k apart.\n\nk=1.\n\nSo for any three points, some two are distance 1 apart.\n\nWe need the largest n such that there is a set of n points in the plane where every three points include a pair at distance 1.\n\nThis is a known type of problem in extremal geometry.\n\nWe want a set where the unit distance graph has the property that every three vertices include an edge.\n\nIn other words, there is no independent set of size 3.\n\nThe unit distance graph has no three pairwise non-adjacent vertices.\n\nEquivalently, the independence number α(G) ≤ 2.\n\nWe want the largest n such that there is a unit distance graph in the plane with n vertices and α(G) ≤ 2.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of points in the plane with no three mutually at distance not 1, but rather, every three have a pair at distance 1.\n\nExamples.\n\nOne example is a set where many pairs are at distance 1.\n\nFor instance, an equilateral triangle with side 1: n=3, every three (only one triple) has pairs at distance 1.\n\nCan we have n=4?\n\nSuppose four points.\n\nIf we have a complete graph K4 with all distances 1, but in the plane, you cannot have four points all at distance 1 (would require tetrahedron, not planar).\n\nMaximum clique size for unit distance is 3 (equilateral triangle).\n\nSuppose we have two equilateral triangles sharing a vertex.\n\nFor example, points: A,B,C equilateral side 1, and A,D,E equilateral side 1, but in plane, if both in plane, might not work.\n\nPlace A at origin, B at (1,0), C at (0.5, √3/2)\n\nThen another point D at distance 1 from A, say at (0.5, -√3/2)\n\nThen we have points A,B,C,D.\n\nDistances: AB=1, AC=1, AD=1, BC=1, BD=? B(1,0), D(0.5,-√3/2), distance sqrt((1-0.5)^2 + (0+√3/2)^2)=sqrt(0.25 + 0.75)=1, similarly CD: C(0.5,√3/2), D(0.5,-√3/2), distance |√3/2 - (-√3/2)| = √3 ≈1.732 ≠1.\n\nNow, check triples.\n\nTriple A,B,C: has AB,AC,BC all 1, good.\n\nA,B,D: AB=1, AD=1, BD=1, good.\n\nA,C,D: AC=1, AD=1, CD=√3≠1, but has AC and AD, good.\n\nB,C,D: BC=1, BD=1, CD=√3≠1, has BC and BD, good.\n\nSo all triples have pairs at distance 1.\n\nn=4.\n\nCan we add a fifth point?\n\nAdd E.\n\nE must be such that for any two existing points, but specifically, for any triple including E, it must have a pair at distance 1.\n\nIn particular, for triple E,X,Y, if X and Y are not at distance 1, then E must be at distance 1 from X or Y or both.\n\nBut more critically, consider three points that are mutually at distance not 1.\n\nIn current set, are there three points with no two at distance 1?\n\nLook at B,C,D: B and C: distance 1, so they have a pair at distance 1.\n\nSimilarly, any three include a pair at distance 1.\n\nIn fact, the only pairs not at distance 1 are C and D, and possibly others.\n\nPairs: A-B:1, A-C:1, A-D:1, B-C:1, B-D:1, C-D:√3≠1.\n\nSo only one pair not at distance 1: C and D.\n\nNow, add E.\n\nFor the triple E,C,D: currently C and D are not at distance 1, so to have some two at distance 1, we need E to be at distance 1 from C or from D or both.\n\nSimilarly, for other triples.\n\nBut also, for triple E,B,C: B and C are at distance 1, so even if E is not at distance 1 from them, the pair B,C ensures it's ok.\n\nSimilarly for any triple that includes a pair at distance 1.\n\nThe only triples that might be problematic are those that include C and D, since they are the only pair not at distance 1.\n\nAny triple containing C and D: if it has another point, say X, then if X is at distance 1 from C or from D, then it's ok, but if not, then the only pairs are C-X, D-X, C-D, and if C-X≠1, D-X≠1, C-D≠1, then no pair at distance 1.\n\nSo for triple E,C,D, we need that either E-C=1 or E-D=1 or both.\n\nSimilarly, if we add more points.\n\nBut also, E might create new pairs.\n\nNow, can we place E such that it is at distance 1 from C or from D.\n\nSay, place E at distance 1 from C.\n\nFor example, on the circle center C radius 1.\n\nBut C is at (0.5, √3/2)\n\nSimilarly, it could be at distance 1 from D.\n\nBut we need only that for each such triple, but since only the pair C,D is missing, the only critical triple is E,C,D.\n\nFor other triples involving E, like E,A,B: A and B are at distance 1, so ok.\n\nSimilarly for any triple not containing both C and D, it will contain some pair that are at distance 1, since the only missing pair is C-D.\n\nIn the set {A,B,C,D}, the only pair not at distance 1 is C-D.\n\nAll other pairs are at distance 1.\n\nTherefore, for any three points including E, if the three include a pair that are at distance 1 in the original, it's ok.\n\nThe only triple that might not have a close pair is if it includes E and two points that are not at distance 1, but in this set, the only such pair is C and D.\n\nSo only the triple E,C,D needs attention.\n\nFor triple E,C,D, we need that min(E-C, E-D, C-D) includes a distance 1, but C-D≠1, so we need E-C=1 or E-D=1.\n\nSo as long as E is at distance 1 from C or from D, it's ok.\n\nMoreover, E can be anywhere else, but we have to ensure that no new bad pairs are created, but since for other triples, they will include existing close pairs, it should be fine.\n\nFor example, place E at distance 1 from C.\n\nSay, at (0.5 + 1, √3/2) = (1.5, √3/2)\n\nThen distance to C: |1.5-0.5|=1, y same, so distance 1.\n\nNow, check distances.\n\nE to A: A(0,0), E(1.5, √3/2), distance sqrt(1.5^2 + (√3/2)^2)=sqrt(2.25 + 0.75)=sqrt(3)≠1\n\nE to B: B(1,0), E(1.5, √3/2), dx=0.5, dy=√3/2, dist=sqrt(0.25+0.75)=1\n\nOh, E to B is also 1.\n\nE to D: D(0.5,-√3/2), E(1.5,√3/2), dx=1, dy=√3, dist=sqrt(1+3)=2≠1\n\nNow, triple E,C,D: E-C=1, so good.\n\nOther triples: E,A,B: A-B=1, good.\n\nE,A,C: A-C=1, good.\n\nE,A,D: A-D=1, good.\n\nE,B,C: B-C=1, good.\n\nE,B,D: B-D=1, good.\n\nE,C,D: E-C=1, good.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow n=5.\n\nCan we add a sixth point F?\n\nSimilarly, for triple F,C,D, we need F-C=1 or F-D=1.\n\nAlso, for other triples, but mainly this one.\n\nBut also, if we add F, we need to ensure that for any three, but since the only pair not at distance 1 might be C-D, and possibly new pairs.\n\nCurrently, with E added, what pairs are not at distance 1?\n\nList all pairs:\n\nA-B:1, A-C:1, A-D:1, A-E:? Earlier E(1.5,√3/2), A(0,0), dist=sqrt(2.25+0.75)=sqrt(3)≠1\n\nA-E: √3 ≠1\n\nSimilarly, B-E:1, as calculated\n\nC-E:1\n\nD-E:2≠1\n\nB-C:1, B-D:1, C-D:√3≠1\n\nC-E:1, D-E:2≠1\n\nA-E:√3≠1\n\nSo pairs not at distance 1: A-E, C-D, D-E, and also A-F later, but currently.\n\nSpecifically, A and E are not at distance 1.\n\nC and D not.\n\nD and E not.\n\nNow, are there three points with no two at distance 1?\n\nFor example, A, D, E: A-D=1, so they have a pair at distance 1.\n\nA, C, D: A-C=1, good.\n\nA, B, E: A-B=1, good.\n\nB, D, E: B-D=1, good.\n\nC, D, E: C-E=1, good.\n\nA, D, E: A-D=1, good.\n\nSo no three points are pairwise not at distance 1; every three include a close pair.\n\nNow add F.\n\nFor any triple containing F, if it contains a pair at distance 1, good.\n\nThe critical triples are those that consist of F and two points that are not at distance 1.\n\nFor example, take points X,Y such that X-Y ≠1.\n\nCurrent pairs with distance not 1: A-E, C-D, D-E, and also A-C? A-C=1, etc.\n\nList unordered pairs with dist ≠1:\n\n- A and E: dist √3 ≠1\n\n- C and D: dist √3 ≠1\n\n- D and E: dist 2 ≠1\n\n- A and D? A-D=1, no\n\n- B and E:1, etc.\n\nAlso, C and E:1, etc.\n\nSo the non-unit pairs are: (A,E), (C,D), (D,E)\n\nNow, are there three points that are pairwise not at distance 1? For example, A, D, E: but A-D=1, so not.\n\nA, C, D: A-C=1.\n\nA, D, E: A-D=1.\n\nC, D, E: C-E=1.\n\nSo no three points are pairwise at non-unit distance.\n\nTherefore, for any two points X,Y with X-Y≠1, and for any third point Z, the triple X,Y,Z will have either X-Z=1 or Y-Z=1 or both, because otherwise X,Y,Z would be pairwise not at distance 1, which doesn't exist.\n\nFor example, take X=A, Y=E, dist≠1.\n\nThen for any Z, in triple A,E,Z, since there is no independent set of size 3, it must have a close pair.\n\nSimilarly for other pairs.\n\nWhen we add F, for a triple F,X,Y where X-Y≠1, we need that F-X=1 or F-Y=1 or both.\n\nThe pairs (X,Y) with X-Y≠1 are: (A,E), (C,D), (D,E)\n\nSo we need:\n\n- For triple F,A,E: since A-E≠1, we need F-A=1 or F-E=1\n\n- For triple F,C,D: since C-D≠1, we need F-C=1 or F-D=1\n\n- For triple F,D,E: since D-E≠1, we need F-D=1 or F-E=1\n\nSo F must satisfy:\n\n1. F-A=1 or F-E=1\n\n2. F-C=1 or F-D=1\n\n3. F-D=1 or F-E=1\n\nNow, can we place such an F in the plane?\n\nF must be at distance 1 from A or from E, and from C or D, and from D or E.\n\nNote that if F is at distance 1 from D, then it satisfies 2 and 3, and for 1, it needs F-A=1 or F-E=1.\n\nSimilarly, if F is at distance 1 from E, it satisfies 1 and 3, and needs F-C=1 or F-D=1.\n\nSuppose we try to place F at distance 1 from D.\n\nD is at (0.5, -√3/2)\n\nCircle center D radius 1.\n\nF on this circle.\n\nThen F-D=1, so conditions 2 and 3 are satisfied.\n\nNow need F-A=1 or F-E=1.\n\nA is at (0,0), E at (1.5, √3/2)\n\nSo F must be on the circle center A radius 1 or center E radius 1.\n\nSo intersection of circle center D radius 1 and (circle center A radius 1 or circle center E radius 1).\n\nFirst, circle D and circle A.\n\nD(0.5, -√3/2), A(0,0)\n\nDistance between A and D: as before, sqrt((0.5-0)^2 + (-√3/2-0)^2)=sqrt(0.25+0.75)=1\n\nSo distance A-D=1, so circles intersect.\n\nTwo circles radius 1, centers distance 1 apart, so they intersect at points forming equilateral triangles.\n\nThe intersection points: one is already C or something, but let's compute.\n\nThe two points at distance 1 from both A and D.\n\nSince A-D=1, the points are such that triangle A,D,F equilateral.\n\nSo F could be at the third vertex.\n\nOne is at (0.5, √3/2)? That's C.\n\nC is at (0.5, √3/2), distance to A: sqrt(0.5^2 + (√3/2)^2)=sqrt(0.25+0.75)=1, to D: as before √3≠1, no.\n\nD is (0.5,-√3/2), so the third vertex for equilateral triangle.\n\nFrom A and D, vector from A to D: (0.5, -√3/2)\n\nRotate by 60 degrees around A.\n\nRotation matrix: cos60=0.5, sin60=√3/2\n\nRotate vector (0.5, -√3/2) by 60 degrees counterclockwise: x' = 0.5*0.5 - (-√3/2)(√3/2) = 0.25 - (-3/4) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1\n\ny' = 0.5*(√3/2) + (-√3/2)*0.5 = (√3/4) - (√3/4) = 0\n\nSo point at A + (1,0) = (0,0)+(1,0)=(1,0) which is B.\n\nBut B is already there.\n\nRotate clockwise: rotate by -60 degrees.\n\nx' = 0.5*0.5 - (-√3/2)(-√3/2) = 0.25 - (3/4) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\ny' = 0.5*(-√3/2) + (-√3/2)*0.5 = -√3/4 - √3/4 = -√3/2\n\nSo point at (0,0) + (-0.5, -√3/2) = (-0.5, -√3/2)\n\nSimilarly, around D, but anyway.\n\nSo intersection points of circle A and circle D: since dist=1, two points: one is B(1,0), the other is (-0.5, -√3/2)\n\nB is already in the set, so the new point is F at (-0.5, -√3/2)\n\nNow, check if it satisfies.\n\nF is at distance 1 from A and from D.\n\nNow, check the conditions.\n\nF-A=1, F-D=1, so certainly F-A=1 or F-E=1 (yes), F-C=1 or F-D=1 (yes, F-D=1), F-D=1 or F-E=1 (yes).\n\nGood.\n\nNow, add F at (-0.5, -√3/2)\n\nNow, check all triples involving F.\n\nFor example, F,A,B: A-B=1, good.\n\nF,A,C: A-C=1, good.\n\nF,A,D: A-D=1, good.\n\nF,A,E: A-E=√3≠1, but F-A=1, so good.\n\nF,B,C: B-C=1, good.\n\nF,B,D: B-D=1, good.\n\nF,B,E: B-E=1, good.\n\nF,C,D: C-D=√3≠1, but F-D=1, so good.\n\nF,C,E: C-E=1, good.\n\nF,D,E: D-E=2≠1, but F-D=1, so good.\n\nF,C,F? Triples are three distinct.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow n=6.\n\nCan we add a seventh point G?\n\nSimilarly, we need to ensure for every pair X,Y with X-Y≠1, and for triple G,X,Y, we need G-X=1 or G-Y=1.\n\nFirst, list all pairs with distance not 1 in the current set.\n\nPoints: A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0.5,√3/2), D(0.5,-√3/2), E(1.5,√3/2), F(-0.5,-√3/2)\n\nCompute all pairwise distances.\n\nWe know:\n\nA-B:1, A-C:1, A-D:1, A-E:√3≈1.732≠1, A-F: distance from (0,0) to (-0.5,-√3/2)= sqrt(0.25+0.75)=1, so A-F=1\n\nB-C:1, B-D:1, B-E:1, B-F: B(1,0), F(-0.5,-√3/2), dx=1.5, dy=√3/2, dist=sqrt(2.25 + 0.75)=sqrt(3)≠1\n\nC-D:√3≠1, C-E:1 (both at y=√3/2, x diff 1), C-F: C(0.5,√3/2), F(-0.5,-√3/2), dx=1, dy=√3, dist=sqrt(1+3)=2≠1\n\nD-E: D(0.5,-√3/2), E(1.5,√3/2), dx=1, dy=√3, dist=2≠1\n\nD-F: D(0.5,-√3/2), F(-0.5,-√3/2), dx=1, dy=0, dist=1\n\nE-F: E(1.5,√3/2), F(-0.5,-√3/2), dx=2, dy=√3, dist=sqrt(4+3)=√7≠1\n\nNow, pairs with dist ≠1:\n\n- A-E: √3 ≠1\n\n- B-F: √3 ≠1\n\n- C-D: √3 ≠1\n\n- C-F: 2 ≠1\n\n- D-E: 2 ≠1\n\n- E-F: √7 ≠1\n\n- Also, C and B:1, etc.\n\nNow, are there three points pairwise not at distance 1? For example, A,E,F: A-E≠1, A-F=1, so A-F=1, so not pairwise.\n\nA,E,B: A-B=1.\n\nA,E,C: A-C=1.\n\nA,E,D: A-D=1.\n\nB,F,C: B-C=1.\n\nB,F,D: B-D=1.\n\nB,F,E: B-E=1.\n\nC,D,F: C-D≠1, C-F≠1, D-F=1, so D-F=1, so has a pair.\n\nC,D,E: C-D≠1, C-E=1, so good.\n\nC,F,E: C-E=1.\n\nD,E,F: D-E≠1, D-F=1, so good.\n\nA,F,E: A-F=1.\n\nSo no three pairwise non-adjacent.\n\nNow add G.\n\nFor each pair X,Y with X-Y≠1, we need that for triple G,X,Y, G-X=1 or G-Y=1.\n\nThe pairs with dist≠1 are: (A,E), (B,F), (C,D), (C,F), (D,E), (E,F)\n\nSo we need:\n\n1. For (A,E): G-A=1 or G-E=1\n\n2. For (B,F): G-B=1 or G-F=1\n\n3. For (C,D): G-C=1 or G-D=1\n\n4. For (C,F): G-C=1 or G-F=1\n\n5. For (D,E): G-D=1 or G-E=1\n\n6. For (E,F): G-E=1 or G-F=1\n\nG must satisfy these six disjunctions.\n\nCan we find such a G in the plane?\n\nNote that if G is at distance 1 from E, then it satisfies 1,5,6.\n\nThen need G-B=1 or G-F=1 (from 2), and G-C=1 or G-D=1 (from 3), and G-C=1 or G-F=1 (from 4).\n\nSimilarly, if G is at distance 1 from F, satisfies 2,4,6, etc.\n\nSuppose we try G on the circle center E radius 1.\n\nE is at (1.5, √3/2)\n\nCircle: (x-1.5)^2 + (y - √3/2)^2 =1\n\nG must also satisfy the other conditions.\n\nFor example, need G-B=1 or G-F=1.\n\nB is at (1,0), F at (-0.5,-√3/2)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThe set of points satisfying G-B=1 or G-F=1 is the union of two circles.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut it might be possible.\n\nNote that the conditions are that G must be within distance 1 of certain points.\n\nSpecifically, from 1: G near A or E\n\nBut since we are on E's circle, G-E=1, so 1 is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, 5 and 6 satisfied.\n\nNow need:\n\n2: G-B=1 or G-F=1\n\n3: G-C=1 or G-D=1\n\n4: G-C=1 or G-F=1\n\nNow, G is on circle center E(1.5, √3/2) radius 1.\n\nThis circle passes through B(1,0)? Distance E to B: as before,1, yes, B is on it.\n\nSimilarly, C is on it? C(0.5,√3/2), E(1.5,√3/2), dist=1, yes.\n\nSo the circle has points B and C on it.\n\nNow, G on this circle.\n\nNow, need G-B=1 or G-F=1, but G-B=1 only if G is at distance 1 from B, but G is on circle center E, so G-B=1 means G is at intersection of circle E and circle B.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nCircle E and circle B: centers E(1.5,√3/2), B(1,0), distance between E and B: sqrt((1.5-1)^2 + (√3/2-0)^2)=sqrt(0.25+0.75)=1\n\nSo two circles radius 1, centers distance 1, so intersect at two points.\n\nOne is C? C(0.5,√3/2), distance to B: sqrt((1-0.5)^2 + (0-√3/2)^2)=sqrt(0.25+0.75)=1, distance to E:1, yes.\n\nThe other intersection point: similar to before, the third vertex.\n\nVector from B to E: (0.5, √3/2)\n\nRotate by 60 degrees around B.\n\nCounterclockwise: x' = 0.5*0.5 - (√3/2)(√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = -0.5\n\ny' = 0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*0.5 = √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2\n\nSo point at B + (-0.5, √3/2) = (1,0) + (-0.5, √3/2) = (0.5, √3/2) which is C.\n\nClockwise: rotate by -60 degrees.\n\nx' = 0.5*0.5 - (√3/2)(-√3/2) = 0.25 - (-3/4) = 0.25+0.75=1\n\ny' = 0.5*(-√3/2) + (√3/2)*0.5 = -√3/4 + √3/4 =0\n\nSo point at (1,0)+(1,0)=(2,0)\n\nSo other intersection point is (2,0)\n\nSimilarly, circle E and circle F: F(-0.5,-√3/2), E(1.5,√3/2), distance sqrt((2)^2 + (√3)^2)=sqrt(4+3)=√7>2, so no intersection, and since dist>2, no common points.\n\nNow, back to G on circle E.\n\nWe need G-B=1 or G-F=1.\n\nG-B=1 only if G is at distance 1 from B, which on circle E, only at the intersection points: C and (2,0)\n\nSimilarly, G-F=1 only if on circle F, but circle E and circle F may intersect.\n\nCircle E center (1.5,√3/2), radius 1\n\nCircle F center (-0.5,-√3/2), radius 1\n\nDistance between centers: as before, sqrt((2)^2 + (√3)^2)=sqrt(4+3)=√7≈2.645>2, so since dist > 1+1=2, the circles do not intersect, and no points are within distance 1 from both.\n\nIn fact, minimum distance between points on the two circles is dist -2 >0.645, so no overlap.\n\nTherefore, G-F=1 is impossible for G on circle E, since the circles are disjoint.\n\nTherefore, for G on circle E, G-F=1 is false.\n\nTherefore, to satisfy condition 2: G-B=1 or G-F=1, since G-F=1 is false, we need G-B=1.\n\nSimilarly, for other conditions.\n\nSo G must be at distance 1 from B.\n\nSince G is on circle E, and G-B=1, so G is at intersection of circle E and circle B, which are points C and (2,0)\n\nC is already in the set, so G could be at (2,0)\n\nNow, check if it satisfies the other conditions.\n\nG at (2,0)\n\nNow, check conditions 3 and 4.\n\n3: G-C=1 or G-D=1\n\nG(2,0), C(0.5,√3/2), dist= sqrt((1.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2)=sqrt(2.25+0.75)=sqrt(3)≠1\n\nG to D(0.5,-√3/2), dist= sqrt((1.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2)=sqrt(2.25+0.75)=sqrt(3)≠1\n\nSo G-C≠1, G-D≠1, so condition 3 not satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, 4: G-C=1 or G-F=1, G-C≠1, G-F: F(-0.5,-√3/2), G(2,0), dx=2.5, dy=√3/2, dist=sqrt(6.25 + 0.75)=sqrt(7)≠1, so not.\n\nSo does not satisfy.\n\nTherefore, G at (2,0) does not work.\n\nAre there other points on circle E? But only when G-B=1, which is only at C and (2,0), both don't work.\n\nC is taken, (2,0) doesn't satisfy.\n\nBut we need G-B=1 for condition 2, since G-F=1 impossible.\n\nBut at (2,0), it doesn't satisfy 3 and 4.\n\nSo no point on circle E satisfies all.\n\nWe could try G on other circles.\n\nFor example, suppose G is at distance 1 from F.\n\nThen it satisfies 2,4,6.\n\nThen need for 1: G-A=1 or G-E=1\n\nFor 3: G-C=1 or G-D=1\n\nFor 5: G-D=1 or G-E=1\n\nG on circle F center (-0.5,-√3/2) radius 1.\n\nThis circle passes through A(0,0)? Distance F to A:1, yes.\n\nD(0.5,-√3/2), F(-0.5,-√3/2), dist=1, yes.\n\nB(1,0): dist sqrt((1+0.5)^2 + (0+√3/2)^2)=sqrt(2.25+0.75)=sqrt(3)≠1\n\nE(1.5,√3/2): dist sqrt((2)^2 + (√3)^2)=sqrt(4+3)=√7≠1\n\nC(0.5,√3/2): dist sqrt((1)^2 + (√3)^2)=sqrt(1+3)=2≠1\n\nNow, need G-A=1 or G-E=1.\n\nG-E=1 only if on circle E, but circle F and circle E are far, dist √7>2, no intersection, so G-E=1 impossible.\n\nTherefore, need G-A=1.\n\nSo G on circle F and circle A.\n\nCircle F and circle A: centers F(-0.5,-√3/2), A(0,0), distance between: as before,1, so intersect.\n\nIntersection points: one is D? D(0.5,-√3/2), dist to A:1, to F:1, yes.\n\nThe other: similar calculation, rotate vector from A to F: (-0.5,-√3/2) by ±60 degrees.\n\nOr from earlier, when we had A and D, but now A and F.\n\nVector A to F: (-0.5,-√3/2)\n\nRotate by 60 deg ccw: x' = (-0.5)(0.5) - (-√3/2)(√3/2) = -0.25 - (-3/4) = -0.25+0.75=0.5\n\ny' = (-0.5)(√3/2) + (-√3/2)(0.5) = -√3/4 - √3/4 = -√3/2\n\nSo point at A + (0.5, -√3/2) = (0.5, -√3/2) which is D.\n\nRotate by -60 deg: x' = (-0.5)(0.5) - (-√3/2)(-√3/2) = -0.25 - (3/4) = -1\n\ny' = (-0.5)(-√3/2) + (-√3/2)(0.5) = √3/4 - √3/4 =0\n\nSo point at (0,0)+(-1,0)=(-1,0)\n\nSo other intersection point is (-1,0)\n\nNow, G at (-1,0)\n\nNow check conditions 3 and 5.\n\n3: G-C=1 or G-D=1\n\nG(-1,0), C(0.5,√3/2), dist= sqrt(1.5^2 + (√3/2)^2)=sqrt(2.25+0.75)=sqrt(3)≠1\n\nG to D(0.5,-√3/2), dist= sqrt(1.5^2 + (√3/2)^2)=sqrt(2.25+0.75)=sqrt(3)≠1\n\nSo not.\n\n5: G-D=1 or G-E=1, both not.\n\nSo does not satisfy.\n\nOther choices.\n\nPerhaps it's impossible to add a seventh point.\n\nIn fact, it is known that the maximum is 6.\n\nFor example, the Moser spindle or other configurations, but in this case, we have a set of 6 points.\n\nAnd it's likely that 7 is impossible.\n\nAssume that the maximum n is 6.\n\nThen for k=1, the largest n is 6.\n\nBut the problem asks for the largest integer n such that there exists a set of n points with the property.\n\nIn our case, we have n=6.\n\nIs n=7 possible? Probably not, but to confirm.\n\nSuppose there is a set of 7 points.\n\nThe unit distance graph has no independent set of size 3, so independence number at most 2.\n\nBy Turán's theorem or something, but in the plane, the maximum number of points with no three mutually at large distance, but here it's that every three have a unit pair.\n\nThe complement graph has no triangle, but not helpful.\n\nIt is known that the maximum is 6.\n\nFor example, the vertices of a regular pentagon with center, but may not work.\n\nI recall that the maximum is 6 for this property in the plane.\n\nSo probably n=6.\n\nThus, the answer is 6.\n\nBut let's confirm the first part.\n\nWe have k = r - 198 = 199 - 198 = 1\n\nThen for k=1, largest n is 6.\n\nSo final answer is 6.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
