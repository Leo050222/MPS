This is because all prime factors of $ m $ divide $ r - 1 $ (from the divisibility conditions), making $ r $ and $ m $ coprime. Thus, $ k = \\\\gcd(r, m) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: By testing constant, linear, and quadratic functions, and analyzing the functional equation, we find that the only solutions are $ f(x) = 0 $ and $ f(x) = x^2 $. Verification shows both satisfy the given equation for all real $ x, y $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=0 and f(x)=x^2\"\n}",
