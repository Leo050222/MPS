Focusing on non-root preimages, level 1 (element 16) has two valid function values (2 and 15) when f(1)=2. For level 2 elements (4 and 13):\\n- If f(16)=2, each has 2 choices (total 4).\\n- If f(16)=15, each has 1 choice (total 1).\\nThus, a₂ = 4 + 1 = 5. Then k = a₂ + 4 = 9.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let roots of f(x)=x³+x+1 be α, β, γ. Using Vieta's formulas: α+β+γ=0, αβ+βγ+γα=1, αβγ=-1. Roots of g are α², β², γ². Compute coefficients:\\n- Sum of roots: α²+β²+γ² = (α+β+γ)² - 2(αβ+βγ+γα) = -2.\\n- Sum of products: α²β²+β²γ²+γ²α² = (αβ+βγ+γα)² - 2αβγ(α+β+γ) = 1.\\n- Product: (αβγ)² = 1.\\nThus, g(x)=x³+2x²+x-1.
