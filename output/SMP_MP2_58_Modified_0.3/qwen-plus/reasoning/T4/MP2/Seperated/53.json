Evaluating at $ x = -1 $, we find $ Q(-1) = 1 $ because $ Q(-1) = (-1 + 1)P(-1) - (-1) = 1 $. Thus, $ m = Q(-1) + 1 = 2 $. The problem explicitly states to compute $ m $ as the solution for $ P(n+1) $, so the answer is 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: After extensive analysis of possible triples $ (a, b, c) $, considering substitutions $ x = a-2 $, $ y = b-2 $, $ z = c-2 $, and checking divisibility conditions, it is found that no triples satisfy both the primality of $ (a-2)(b-2)(c-2) + 12 $ and its proper division of $ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc - 2017 $. Cases where $ N $ is positive fail the divisibility condition, and cases where divisibility holds result in negative $ N $, which is invalid. Thus, no such triples exist.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
