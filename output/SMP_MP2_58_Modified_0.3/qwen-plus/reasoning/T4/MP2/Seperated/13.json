      "A3251": "Suppose that a positive integer $N$ can be expressed as the sum of $k$ consecutive positive integers \\[ N = a + (a+1) +(a+2) + \\cdots + (a+k-1) \\] for $k=2017$ but for no other values of $k>1$. Considering all positive integers $N$ with this property, what is the smallest positive integer $a$ that occurs in any of these expressions? Instead of identifying the minimal initial term in the unique representation of such $N$ as a sum of consecutive positive integers, simply find $d = a - 15$, where $a$ is the smallest positive integer serving as the initial term in any such representation derived from the condition that $N$ admits no other decompositions into consecutive sums for $k>1$."

Thus, $N = 2017M$ where $M = a + 1008$, so $a = M - 1008$. For $N$ to have no other representations as a sum of $k > 1$ consecutive positive integers, $N$ must have exactly one odd divisor greater than 1 (which is 2017), implying $M$ must be a power of 2 (to avoid other odd prime factors). The smallest $M > 1008$ that is a power of 2 is $1024 = 2^{10}$, giving $a = 1024 - 1008 = 16$. Thus, $d = a - 15 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The condition requires that for every $m$ coprime to $n$, the map $k \\\\mapsto mk \\\\mod n$ is a square in the symmetric group $S_n$. This holds if and only if $n$ is 1, 2, or 6. For $n = 1$, trivial; $n = 2$, only $m = 1$ works; $n = 6$, $m = 1$ and $m = 5$ both yield permutations with even transposition counts, allowing square roots. Larger $n$ fail due to odd transposition counts or non-square cycle structures.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1, 2, 6\"\n}",
