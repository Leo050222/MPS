Setting $ y = 1 $ gives $ f(1) = f(0) + |f(1)| $. If $ f(1) \\\\geq 0 $, this implies $ f(0) = 0 $. If $ f(1) < 0 $, contradictions arise when analyzing $ y = -1 $ and other values, showing $ f(0) $ must be 0. Thus, $ k = f(0) + 4 = 4 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize circles through 4 concyclic points among 7 arbitrary points, arrange points on a parabola. A circle intersects a parabola in at most 4 points, so no 5 points are concyclic. Each 4-point subset defines a unique circle, yielding $ \\\\binom{7}{4} = 35 $ circles.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"35\"\n}",
