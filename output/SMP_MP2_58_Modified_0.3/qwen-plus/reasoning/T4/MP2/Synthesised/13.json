  "math_problem": "Suppose that a positive integer $N$ can be expressed as the sum of $k$ consecutive positive integers \\[ N = a + (a+1) +(a+2) + \\cdots + (a+k-1) \\] for $k=2017$ but for no other values of $k>1$. Considering all positive integers $N$ with this property, what is the smallest positive integer $a$ that occurs in any of these expressions? Instead of identifying the minimal initial term in the unique representation of such $N$ as a sum of consecutive positive integers, simply find $d = a - 15$, where $a$ is the smallest positive integer serving as the initial term in any such representation derived from the condition that $N$ admits no other decompositions into consecutive sums for $k>1$. Determine which positive integers $n$ have the following property: For all integers $m$ such that $\\gcd(m,n)=d$, there exists a permutation $\\pi\\colon \\{1,2,\\dots,n\\} \\to \\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$ such that $\\pi(\\pi(k)) \\equiv mk \\pmod{n}$ for all $k \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding the smallest initial term $a$ for which a positive integer $N$ can be expressed as the sum of 2017 consecutive positive integers but no other $k > 1$. Using the formula for the sum of $k$ consecutive integers, $N = \\\\frac{k}{2}(2a + k - 1)$, we derive $2N = k(2a + k - 1)$. For $k = 2017$, this gives $2N = 2017(2a + 2016)$, so $N = 2017(a + 1008)$. \\n\\nTo ensure $N$ cannot be expressed as a sum of $k > 1$ consecutive integers for any other $k$, the number of such representations must be exactly 1. This corresponds to $N$ having exactly two odd divisors (since the number of representations equals the number of odd divisors of $N$ minus 1). Thus, the odd part of $N$ must be a prime number. Since $2017$ is prime, $N = 2^s \\\\cdot 2017$ for some $s \\\\geq 1$, and $a = 2^s - 1008$. The smallest $a > 0$ occurs at $s = 10$, giving $a = 1024 - 1008 = 16$. Hence, $d = a - 15 = 1$.\\n\\nNext, we determine all positive integers $n$ such that for all $m$ with $\\\\gcd(m, n) = d = 1$, there exists a permutation $\\\\pi$ with $\\\\pi(\\\\pi(k)) \\\\equiv mk \\\\pmod{n}$. This requires that the multiplication map $L_m(k) = mk \\\\mod n$ is a square in the symmetric group $S_n$ for all $m$ coprime to $n$. Analysis shows this holds if and only if $n = 1$ or $n \\\\equiv 2 \\\\pmod{4}$, as these are the only cases where the cycle structure of $L_m$ has even multiplicities for all cycle lengths, ensuring it is a square.\",\n    \"answer\": \"all positive integers n such that n = 1 or n ≡ 2 mod 4\"\n}",
