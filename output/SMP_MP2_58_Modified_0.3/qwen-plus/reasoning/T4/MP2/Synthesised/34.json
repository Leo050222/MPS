  "math_problem": "Determine all functions $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ such that for every pair of real numbers $x$ and $y$,  \n\\[f(x+y^2)=f(x)+|y f(y)|.\\] Instead of characterizing all functions satisfying the given functional equation, simply find $k = f(0) + 4$, where $f(0)$ is the value of the function at zero derived from analysis of the functional equation. There are arbitrary 7 points in the plane. Circles are drawn through every $k$ possible concyclic points. Find the maximum number of circles that can be drawn.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the functional equation $f(x + y^2) = f(x) + |y f(y)|$ for all real $x, y$. Setting $x = 0$ gives $f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)|$. Testing constant functions, $f(x) = 0$ works. For linear functions $f(x) = kx$ with $k \\\\geq 0$, substituting into the equation confirms validity. All solutions satisfy $f(0) = 0$, so $k = f(0) + 4 = 4$.  \\n\\nNext, with $k = 4$, determine the maximum number of circles through 4 concyclic points among 7 arbitrary points. Using combinatorial geometry, the maximum number of distinct circles each containing at least 4 points is constrained by pairwise intersections (at most 2 points per circle pair). The bound $6M \\\\leq 21 \\\\times 2$ (where $M$ is the number of circles) gives $M \\\\leq 7$. This is achievable via a $(7, 4, 2)$ block design (complement of the Fano plane), where each pair of points lies on exactly 2 circles, yielding 7 circles.\",\n    \"answer\": \"7\"\n}",
