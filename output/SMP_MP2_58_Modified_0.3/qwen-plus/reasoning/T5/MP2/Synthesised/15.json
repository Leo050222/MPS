Instead of finding all monic polynomials with integer coefficients such that there exists a positive integer $N$ where for every prime $p>N$ with $f(p)$ a positive integer, $p$ divides $2(f(p)!)+1$, simply find $d = k - 2$, where $k$ is the absolute value of the constant term in the unique linear monic polynomial with integer coefficients that satisfies the condition. Does there exist a function $f: \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R $  satisfying the following conditions: \n(i) for each real $y$  there is a real  $x$ such that $f(x)=y$ , and \n(ii)  $f(f(x)) = (x - d)f(x) + 2$ for all real $x$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, consider the linear monic polynomial $ f(x) = x + c $ with integer coefficients. For primes $ p > N $, $ f(p) = p + c $ must be positive, so $ c $ is likely negative. Using Wilson's theorem, we analyze $ 2(f(p)!) + 1 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod p $. For $ f(p) = p - m $, we derive $ 2(p - m)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. Using Wilson's theorem, $ (p - 1)! = (p - 1)(p - 2)\\\\cdots(p - m + 1)(p - m)! \\\\equiv (-1)^{m-1}(m-1)!(p - m)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. Solving $ 2(-1)^m / (m-1)! + 1 = 0 $, we find $ m = 3 $ works, giving $ c = -3 $. The constant term is $ -3 $, so $ k = | -3 | = 3 $, and $ d = k - 2 = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, check if a function $ f: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} $ exists with $ f(f(x)) = (x - 1)f(x) + 2 $ and surjectivity. Assume surjectivity: for $ y = 0 $, there exists $ b $ with $ f(b) = 0 $, leading to $ f(0) = 2 $. From $ x = 0 $, $ f(2) = 0 $. For $ y = 1 $, surjectivity gives $ f(a) = 1 $, leading to $ f(1) = 0 $. For $ y = -1 $, surjectivity gives $ f(d) = -1 $, leading to $ f(-1) = 1 $. From $ x = -1 $, $ f(1) = 0 $, but from $ f(d) = -1 $, $ d = 2 $ implies $ f(2) = -1 $, contradicting $ f(2) = 0 $. This contradiction proves no such function exists.\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\"\n}",
