Instead of finding all functions satisfying the given functional equation and limit condition, simply find $k = f(1) + 1$, where $f(1)$ is the constant factor in the scaling relation $f(f(y)) = f(1) y$ derived from the functional equation."

This satisfies the equation: f(xf(y))=f(x/y)=y/x=yf(x). The limit condition f(x)→0 as x→∞ holds. For f(y)=1/y, f(1)=1, so k=f(1)+1=2.\\n\\nProblem 2: The product (x₁²+1)...(x₄²+1) equals P(i)P(-i) where P(x)=x⁴+ax³+bx²+cx+d. Computing this gives (1−b+d)²+(c−a)². Let t=b−d≥5; then 1−b+d=1−t. The expression becomes (1−t)²+(c−a)². Minimizing requires t=5 (smallest t) and c=a (to eliminate the second term). For roots all 1, P(x)=(x−1)⁴, so b=6, d=1, t=5, and c=a=−4. The product is (1−5)²+0=16.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"16\"\n}",
