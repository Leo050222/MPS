The greatest common divisor (gcd) of these primes is gcd(43, 47) = 1. The problem instructs to compute k = d - 1 where d is this gcd, so k = 1 - 1 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize the sum S, consider sequences where a_k forms a geometric progression. Setting a_k = (3/4)(1/4)^{k-1} satisfies the constraint sum a_k = 1. Calculating the terms, the sum S converges to 2/3. Using Lagrange multipliers and verifying critical points confirms this is the maximum value, as other configurations yield lower sums.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2/3\"\n}",
