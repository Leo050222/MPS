      "A1098": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability $ p $ that all intermediate rock counts are multiples of 5 is analyzed using recurrence relations. Starting from 2015 rocks (a multiple of 5), each step requires removing a multiple of 5 rocks. The recurrence shows the probability depends on the product of terms involving 31. The exponent of 31 in the numerator is 14 (from 13 terms, one contributing $ 31^2 $) and in the denominator (from 403!) is 13. Thus, $ b = 14 - 13 = 1 $, so $ m = b + 2 = 3 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using the identity $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) $, substituting $ x+y+z=3 $ and $ x^3+y^3+z^3=3 $ leads to $ 3P_2 - P_3 = 8 $ where $ P_2 = xy + yz + zx $, $ P_3 = xyz $. Solving for symmetric cases (two variables equal) yields solutions: all ones $ (1,1,1) $ and permutations of $ (-5,4,4) $. These are the only solutions where variables are real or form symmetric complex triples, as verified by substitution and discriminant analysis.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"all permutations of (1, 1, 1) and (-5, 4, 4)\"\n}",
