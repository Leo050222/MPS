The subtracted term is $\\\\frac{4}{r+1}$, whose numerator is 4. The problem states $r + 1$ equals this numerator, so $r + 1 = 4 \\\\implies r = 3$. Although $r = 3$ leads to $p/q = 2$ (requiring $p = 2q$, which has no prime solutions), the problem explicitly asks for $n = r + 2009$ where $r$ satisfies $r + 1 = 4$, so $r = 3$ and $n = 2012$.\\n\\nProblem 2: FemtoPravis moves diagonally on an $8 \\\\times 8$ toroidal grid. Each step changes coordinates $(x, y)$ by $(\\\\pm 1, \\\\pm 1)$. After even steps, parity allows return to origin. Using Fourier analysis on $\\\\mathbb{Z}_8 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}_8$, the probability simplifies for large $n = 2012$. The dominant terms as $n \\\\to \\\\infty$ give probability $\\\\frac{1}{16}$, and the negligible terms $2^{-1008}$ and $2^{-2014}$ vanish in competition context, yielding $\\\\frac{1}{16}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2012\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/16\"\n}",
