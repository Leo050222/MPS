Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing the sum of all possible totals and the associated $100m + n$, simply find $k = z - 2$, where $z$ is the common value taken by the two equal variables in the solution where exactly two of the variables are equal."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We consider the case where exactly two variables are equal. Assuming x = y ≠ z, solving the system leads to the cubic equation 2x³ - 9x² + 10x - 3 = 0. The roots are x = 1, 1/2, 3. The roots x = 1 and x = 1/2 result in all three variables being equal (x = y = z), which is not the case we want. The root x = 3 gives x = y = 3 and z = -1/3, where exactly two variables are equal. The common value of the two equal variables is 3. Thus, k = z - 2 (where z here is the common value, not the variable) is 3 - 2 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The polygons are ICAO (4-gon), VENTI (5-gon), and ALBEDO (6-gon). The key is determining the number of distinct distances ON given IN = 1. The relative orientations of the polygons at shared vertices (A and E) lead to two distinct configurations due to symmetry (clockwise and counterclockwise). Each configuration results in a unique distance ON, but due to cosine symmetry (cos(θ) = cos(-θ) and cos(180°±θ) = -cos(θ)), there are only two distinct values for ON.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\"\n}",
