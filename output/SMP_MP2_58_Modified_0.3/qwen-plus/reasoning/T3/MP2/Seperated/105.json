By computing terms step-by-step, we observe a pattern where primes repeat in runs until the sum reaches a product of consecutive primes. For a₁₀₀, the two preceding terms are a₉₈=47 and a₉₉=53. Their sum is 47 + 53 = 100.\\n\\nProblem 2: Alice aims to maximize the minimum distance from her final number to any perfect square after 100 operations (add 1 or square). The optimal strategy involves adding 2 initially (2 operations), squaring four times (6 operations total), then adding 94 times. This results in X = 65536 + 94 = 65630. The closest squares are 256²=65536 (distance 94) and 257²=66049 (distance 419), so the minimum distance is 94.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"94\"\n}",
