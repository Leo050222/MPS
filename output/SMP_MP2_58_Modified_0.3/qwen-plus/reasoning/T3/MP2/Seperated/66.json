However, the two dice are not fair, meaning that they can land on each face with different probability. Marisa rolls the two dice and calculates their sum. Given that the sum is 2 with probability 0.04, and 12 with probability 0.01, the maximum possible probability of the sum being 7 is $p$. Compute $\\lfloor 100 p\\rfloor$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To find a positive integer $a$ such that $x^2 - ax + a$ has an integer root, assume $r$ is an integer root. Then $r^2 - ar + a = 0 \\\\implies a = \\\\frac{r^2}{r - 1}$. For $a$ to be a positive integer, $r - 1$ must divide $r^2$. Rewriting $r^2 = (r - 1)(r + 1) + 1$, we see $r - 1$ must divide 1. Thus, $r - 1 = \\\\pm 1$. For $r = 2$, $a = 4$ (valid). For $r = 0$, $a = 0$ (invalid as $a$ must be positive). Only $a = 4$ works. Hence, $k = a + 7 = 11$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let $p_i$ be the probability of rolling $i$ on one die. Sum 2 probability is $p_1^2 = 0.04 \\\\implies p_1 = 0.2$. Sum 12 probability is $p_6^2 = 0.01 \\\\implies p_6 = 0.1$. Sum 7 probability is $2(p_1p_6 + p_2p_5 + p_3p_4)$. With $p_1 = 0.2$, $p_6 = 0.1$, and $p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 0.7$, maximize $p_2p_5 + p_3p_4$. By AM-GM, maximum occurs when $p_2 = p_5 = 0.35$ (or $p_3 = p_4 = 0.35$), giving $p_2p_5 = 0.1225$. Total sum 7 probability is $2(0.02 + 0.1225) = 0.285$. Thus, $\\\\lfloor 100 \\\\times 0.285 \\\\rfloor = 28$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"28\"\n}",
