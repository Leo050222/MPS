Factorizing 2019 as $ 3 \\\\times 673 $, we analyze the Euler's totient function for both sides. After simplifying using properties of $ \\\\varphi $, we find that $ n = 2019 $ is the only solution where $ n $ is a multiple of 2019. Thus, $ \\\\gcd(2019, n) = 2019 $, and $ k = 2019 - 2018 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The recurrence relation is transformed by defining $ b_n = a_n + 1 $, leading to $ b_{n+1} = \\\\frac{b_n^2}{b_{n-1}} $. Using initial conditions $ a_1 = 1 $ (so $ b_1 = 2 $) and $ a_9 = 7 $ (so $ b_9 = 8 $), we derive $ b_9 = \\\\frac{(b_2)^8}{128} = 8 $, giving $ (b_2)^8 = 1024 $. Solving for $ b_5 $, we find $ b_5 = 4 $, so $ a_5 = b_5 - 1 = 3 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
