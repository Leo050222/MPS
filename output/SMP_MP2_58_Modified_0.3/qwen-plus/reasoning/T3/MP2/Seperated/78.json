Compute Q(-1) = (-1)² + 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2. Then k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Suppose such an irrational α > 1 exists. For each n ≥ 1, floor(αⁿ) must be divisible by 2017. Consider α = N + ε where N is a multiple of 2017 and 0 < ε < 1. For n=1, floor(α) = N, which is divisible by 2017. For n=2, floor(α²) = N² + floor(2Nε + ε²). To be divisible by 2017, floor(2Nε + ε²) must be a multiple of 2017. However, for higher n, the required conditions on ε become increasingly restrictive (e.g., ε < 1/(nN^{n-1}) for all n), which is impossible for any fixed ε > 0. Additionally, if α were a Pisot number, the sequence floor(αⁿ) mod 2017 would be periodic but cannot be constant 0 for all n due to exponential growth. Equidistribution theorems also imply that fractional parts of αⁿ would not consistently align to make floor(αⁿ) divisible by 2017. Thus, no such irrational α exists.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
