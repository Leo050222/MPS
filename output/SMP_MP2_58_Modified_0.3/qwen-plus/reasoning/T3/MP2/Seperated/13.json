Find the number of anti-palindromes less than $3^{12}$ such that no two consecutive digits in base 3 are equal. Instead of determining the total count of qualifying anti-palindromes, simply find $k = b_1 + 27$, where $b_1$ is the number of valid anti-palindromes with one digit derived from the anti-palindrome condition and the no consecutive equal digits constraint."

This is the only valid one-digit anti-palindrome (since 0 and 2 fail the condition). The no consecutive digits constraint is vacuously true for one digit. Thus, $b_1 = 1$, and $k = 1 + 27 = 28$. Problem 2: Constructing a valid cyclic sequence of ten numbers where each is one more than the gcd of its neighbors, a working example is [2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3]. Summing these gives 28. Other valid configurations also sum to 28, confirming the result.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"28\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"28\"\n}",
