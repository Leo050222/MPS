Substituting gives $a^5 + n^5 = 16an$. Testing small values, $a = 2$ and $n = 2$ satisfies the equation: $2^5 + 2^5 = 32 + 32 = 64 = 16 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 2$. Thus, the solution pair is $(-2, 2)$, where $n = 2$ (positive integer). Then $k = n - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given polynomial $x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48$ with roots $p < q < r$, we have $pqr = 48$. To minimize $\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$, use Lagrange multipliers with constraint $pqr = 48$. Solving yields $q = 2p$, $r = 3p$, leading to $p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$.
