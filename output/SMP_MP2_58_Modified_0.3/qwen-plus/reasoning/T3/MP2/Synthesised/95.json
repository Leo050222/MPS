  "math_problem": "Find all prime numbers $p,q,r$ , such that $\\frac{p}{q}-\\frac{4}{r+1}=1$ Instead of finding all prime numbers $p,q,r$ satisfying the given equation, simply find $n = r + 2009$, where $r$ is the prime number such that $r + 1$ equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term. FemtoPravis is walking on an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard that wraps around at its edges (so squares on the left edge of the chessboard are adjacent to squares on the right edge, and similarly for the top and bottom edges). Each femtosecond, FemtoPravis moves in one of the four diagonal directions uniformly at random. After $n$ femtoseconds, what is the probability that FemtoPravis is at his original location?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve for prime $ r $ such that $ r + 1 $ equals the numerator of the subtracted term $ \\\\frac{4}{r+1} $. The numerator is 4, so $ r + 1 = 4 \\\\implies r = 3 $ (a prime). Thus, $ n = r + 2009 = 3 + 2009 = 2012 $.\\n\\nNext, analyze FemtoPravis's movement on an $ 8 \\\\times 8 $ toroidal grid. Each diagonal move changes coordinates by $ (\\\\pm 1, \\\\pm 1) $. After $ t = 2012 $ steps (even), the walk is confined to states where both coordinates are even (mod 8). Using Fourier analysis and character sums, the probability of returning to the origin converges to $ \\\\frac{1}{16} $ for large even $ t $, as higher-order terms vanish. For $ t = 2012 $, the negligible terms confirm the limit value.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/16\"\n}",
