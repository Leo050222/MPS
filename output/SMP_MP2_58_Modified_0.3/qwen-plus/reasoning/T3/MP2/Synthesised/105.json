  "math_problem": "Consider a sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ of integers, satisfying $a_1=1, a_2=2$ and $a_{n+1}$ is the largest prime divisor of $a_1+a_2+\\ldots+a_n$. Find $a_{100}$. Instead of determining the final term of the sequence, simply find $m$, the sum of the two consecutive terms immediately preceding that final term. Alice starts with the number 0. She can apply $m$ operations on her number. In each operation, she can either add 1 to her number, or square her number. After applying all operations, her score is the minimum distance from her number to any perfect square. What is the maximum score she can attain?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first analyze the sequence $\\\\{a_n\\\\}$ defined by $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 2$, and $a_{n+1}$ being the largest prime divisor of the sum $S_n = a_1 + a_2 + \\\\ldots + a_n$. Computing initial terms reveals a pattern where each prime $p$ appears for a specific number of terms before transitioning to the next prime. For primes $p = 3$ and $p = 5$, the count is 4 terms each, while for all primes $p \\\\geq 7$, the count is 6 terms. By tracking cumulative term counts:\\n\\n- Terms 1–2: $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 2$\\n- Terms 3–6: $a_n = 3$ (4 terms)\\n- Terms 7–10: $a_n = 5$ (4 terms)\\n- Terms 11–16: $a_n = 7$ (6 terms)\\n- Terms 17–22: $a_n = 11$ (6 terms)\\n- Terms 23–28: $a_n = 13$ (6 terms)\\n- Terms 29–34: $a_n = 17$ (6 terms)\\n- Terms 35–40: $a_n = 19$ (6 terms)\\n- Terms 41–46: $a_n = 23$ (6 terms)\\n- Terms 47–52: $a_n = 29$ (6 terms)\\n- Terms 53–58: $a_n = 31$ (6 terms)\\n- Terms 59–64: $a_n = 37$ (6 terms)\\n- Terms 65–70: $a_n = 41$ (6 terms)\\n- Terms 71–76: $a_n = 43$ (6 terms)\\n- Terms 77–82: $a_n = 47$ (6 terms)\\n- Terms 83–88: $a_n = 53$ (6 terms)\\n- Terms 89–94: $a_n = 59$ (6 terms)\\n- Terms 95–100: $a_n = 61$ (6 terms)\\n\\nThus, $a_{98} = 61$, $a_{99} = 61$, so $m = 61 + 61 = 122$.\\n\\nNext, Alice starts with 0 and applies 122 operations (each +1 or square). To maximize the minimum distance to any perfect square, the optimal strategy is:\\n- Use 6 operations to reach $65536$ via repeated squaring: $+1, +1, \\\\text{square}, \\\\text{square}, \\\\text{square}, \\\\text{square}$.\\n- Add 116 times to get $65536 + 116 = 65652$.\\n\\nThe nearest squares are $256^2 = 65536$ (distance 116) and $257^2 = 66049$ (distance 397). The minimum distance is 116, which is the maximum achievable score.\",\n    \"answer\": \"116\"\n}",
