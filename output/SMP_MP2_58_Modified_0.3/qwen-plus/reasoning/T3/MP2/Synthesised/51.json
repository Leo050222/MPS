  "math_problem": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form. Determine all the roots, real or complex, of the system of simultaneous equations $x + y + z = m$, $x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = m$, $x^{m} + y^{m} + z^{m} = m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding the roots of the system of equations with $ m = 3 $. Starting from the initial rock pile of 2015 (a multiple of 5), the probability $ p $ that all intermediate pile sizes are multiples of 5 leads to analyzing the recurrence relation for $ f(m) $, the probability starting from $ m = 403 $. The exponent $ b $ of 31 in $ p $ is determined to be 1, so $ m = b + 2 = 3 $. \\n\\nFor the system:\\n- $ x + y + z = 3 $\\n- $ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3 $\\n- $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 $\\n\\nUsing Newton's identities, the elementary symmetric sums are $ s_1 = 3 $, $ s_2 = 3 $, $ s_3 = 1 $, leading to the polynomial $ (t - 1)^3 = 0 $. Thus, all roots are $ 1 $, repeated three times.\", \"answer\": \"1, 1, 1\"}",
