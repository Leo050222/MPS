  "math_problem": "Let $Q(x)=x^{2}+2x+3$, and suppose that $P(x)$ is a polynomial such that $P(Q(x))=x^{6}+6x^{5}+18x^{4}+32x^{3}+35x^{2}+22x+8$. Compute $P(2)$. Instead of computing $P(2)$, simply find $k = Q(r) - 1$, where $r$ is the unique real root of the derivative of $Q$. Does there exist an irrational number $\\alpha>k$ such that $\\left\\lfloor\\alpha^{n}\\right\\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod 2017)$ for all integers $n \\geq k$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find the derivative of $ Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3 $, which is $ Q'(x) = 2x + 2 $. The unique real root $ r $ satisfies $ 2x + 2 = 0 $, so $ r = -1 $. Compute $ Q(r) = Q(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2 $. Thus, $ k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, determine if there exists an irrational $ \\\\alpha > k = 1 $ such that $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $ for all integers $ n \\\\geq k = 1 $. For $ n = 1 $, $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha \\\\rfloor $ must be divisible by 2017, so $ \\\\alpha \\\\in [2017, 2018) $. For $ n = 2 $, $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^2 \\\\rfloor $ must also be divisible by 2017, requiring $ \\\\alpha^2 \\\\in [2017^2, 2017^2 + 1) $ or similar intervals. However, as $ n $ increases, the condition $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $ imposes increasingly strict constraints on $ \\\\alpha $. By analyzing the growth of $ \\\\alpha^n $ and the modular requirement, it becomes evident that no irrational $ \\\\alpha $ can satisfy the condition for all $ n \\\\geq 1 $. Specifically, the fractional parts $ \\\\{\\\\alpha^n\\\\} $ would need to avoid certain residues modulo 2017, but for irrational $ \\\\alpha > 1 $, the sequence $ \\\\{\\\\alpha^n\\\\} $ is either dense in $[0, 1)$ (by equidistribution theorems) or tends to 0 (for Pisot numbers), neither of which guarantees $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $ for all $ n $. Thus, no such irrational $ \\\\alpha $ exists.\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\"\n}",
