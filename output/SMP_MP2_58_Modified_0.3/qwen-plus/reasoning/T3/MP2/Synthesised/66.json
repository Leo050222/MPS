  "math_problem": "For how many positive integers $a$ does the polynomial $x^{2}-a x+a$ have an integer root? Instead of counting the positive integers $a$ such that the given quadratic polynomial has an integer root, simply find $k = a + 7$, where $a$ is a positive integer such that $x^{2} - a x + a$ has an integer root. Marisa has two identical cubical dice labeled with the numbers \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\). However, the two dice are not fair, meaning that they can land on each face with different probability. Marisa rolls the two dice and calculates their sum. Given that the sum is 2 with probability 0.04, and 12 with probability 0.01, the maximum possible probability of the sum being $k$ is $p$. Compute $\\lfloor 100 p \\rfloor$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the value of $k$. The polynomial $x^2 - ax + a$ has an integer root $r$. Substituting $r$ gives $r^2 - ar + a = 0$, so $a = \\\\frac{r^2}{r - 1}$. For $a$ to be a positive integer, $r - 1$ must divide $r^2$. Rewriting $a = r + 1 + \\\\frac{1}{r - 1}$, $\\\\frac{1}{r - 1}$ must be an integer, so $r - 1 = \\\\pm 1$. This gives $r = 2$ (yielding $a = 4$) or $r = 0$ (yielding $a = 0$, invalid as $a$ must be positive). Thus, $a = 4$ is the only valid solution, so $k = a + 7 = 11$.\\n\\nNext, analyze the dice probabilities. Let $p_i$ be the probability of rolling $i$ on one die. Given $\\\\text{P}(\\\\text{sum} = 2) = p_1^2 = 0.04$, so $p_1 = 0.2$. Similarly, $\\\\text{P}(\\\\text{sum} = 12) = p_6^2 = 0.01$, so $p_6 = 0.1$. The sum $k = 11$ occurs for pairs $(5,6)$ and $(6,5)$, so its probability is $2p_5p_6 = 0.2p_5$. To maximize this, maximize $p_5$ under the constraint $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 = 1$. Substituting known values, $p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 0.7$. The maximum $p_5 = 0.7$ (when $p_2 = p_3 = p_4 = 0$) gives $\\\\text{P}(\\\\text{sum} = 11) = 0.2 \\\\times 0.7 = 0.14$. Thus, $\\\\lfloor 100 \\\\times 0.14 \\\\rfloor = 14$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"14\"\n}",
