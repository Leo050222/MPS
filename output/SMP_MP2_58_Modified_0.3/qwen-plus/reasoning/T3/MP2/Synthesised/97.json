Instead of determining the smallest achievable absolute value for the sum of the polynomial evaluations at the two intermediate points, simply find $m = P(70) + 162$, where $P$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients such that $P(0) + P(90) = 2018$ that achieves this smallest value. Milan has a bag of $m-1$ red balls and $m$ green balls. He repeatedly draws 2 balls out of the bag uniformly at random. If they are the same color, he changes them both to the opposite color and returns them to the bag. If they are different colors, he discards them. Eventually the bag has 1 ball left.

  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the polynomial constraint. Let $ P $ be a polynomial with integer coefficients such that $ P(0) + P(90) = 2018 $. We are to find the least possible value of $ |P(20) + P(70)| $, and instead of computing this directly, we are told to compute $ m = P(70) + 162 $ for a specific $ P $ achieving this minimal value.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Understanding the Polynomial Constraint\\n\\nLet $ Q(x) = P(x) + P(90 - x) $. Since $ P $ has integer coefficients, so does $ Q $, and it satisfies:\\n- $ Q(0) = P(0) + P(90) = 2018 $\\n- $ Q(x) $ is symmetric around $ x = 45 $, i.e., $ Q(90 - x) = Q(x) $\\n\\nThus, $ Q(x) $ can be written as $ Q(x) = R((x - 45)^2) $, where $ R $ is a polynomial with integer coefficients.\\n\\nWe want to minimize $ |Q(20)| = |P(20) + P(70)| $.\\n\\nSince $ Q(x) $ is symmetric, $ Q(20) = Q(70) $, and we know:\\n$$\\nQ(20) = R(625), \\\\quad Q(0) = R(2025)\\n$$\\nBecause $ R $ has integer coefficients, $ R(2025) - R(625) $ must be divisible by $ 2025 - 625 = 1400 $, so:\\n$$\\nQ(20) = 2018 - 1400k \\\\quad \\\\text{for some integer } k\\n$$\\nThe smallest absolute value of $ Q(20) $ occurs when $ k = 2 $, giving:\\n$$\\nQ(20) = 2018 - 2800 = -782\\n$$\\nThis is the minimal achievable value of $ |P(20) + P(70)| $, which is 782.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Constructing a Valid Polynomial\\n\\nWe construct a quadratic polynomial $ P(x) = x^2 - 80x + 559 $, which has integer coefficients and satisfies:\\n- $ P(0) = 559 $\\n- $ P(90) = 8100 - 7200 + 559 = 1459 $\\n- $ P(0) + P(90) = 2018 $\\n- $ P(20) = 400 - 1600 + 559 = -641 $\\n- $ P(70) = 4900 - 5600 + 559 = -141 $\\n- $ P(20) + P(70) = -641 + (-141) = -782 $\\n\\nSo this polynomial achieves the minimal value of $ |P(20) + P(70)| = 782 $.\\n\\nNow compute:\\n$$\\nm = P(70) + 162 = -141 + 162 = 21\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Ball Problem\\n\\nMilan has $ m - 1 = 20 $ red balls and $ m = 21 $ green balls. He repeatedly draws two balls at random:\\n- If both are the same color, he changes them to the opposite color and returns them.\\n- If they are different, he discards both.\\n\\nEventually, only one ball remains. We are to compute the probability $ p $ that it is green, then compute $ \\\\lfloor m \\\\cdot p \\\\rfloor $.\\n\\nDefine $ D = G - R $, the difference between the number of green and red balls. Initially:\\n$$\\nD = 21 - 20 = 1\\n$$\\n\\nEach operation affects $ D $ as follows:\\n- **RR**: $ D \\\\to D + 4 $\\n- **GG**: $ D \\\\to D - 4 $\\n- **RG/GR**: $ D \\\\to D $\\n\\nSo $ D \\\\mod 4 $ is invariant throughout the process.\\n\\nAt the end, if the last ball is green, then $ D = 1 $; if red, $ D = -1 \\\\equiv 3 \\\\mod 4 $. Since the initial $ D \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 4 $, the final state must have $ D \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 4 $, meaning the last ball **must** be green.\\n\\nTherefore, $ p = 1 $, and:\\n$$\\n\\\\lfloor m \\\\cdot p \\\\rfloor = \\\\lfloor 21 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\rfloor = 21\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"21\"}",
