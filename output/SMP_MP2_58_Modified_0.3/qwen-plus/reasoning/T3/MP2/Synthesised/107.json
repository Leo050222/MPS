Suppose $x^{3}-a x^{2}+b x-48$ is a polynomial with three positive roots $p, q$, and $r$ such that $p<q<r$. What is the minimum possible value of $k / p+2 / q+3 / r$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we proceed in two distinct parts as outlined.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Part 1: Solving the Diophantine Equation**\\n\\nWe are given the equation:\\n$$\\nm^5 - n^5 = 16mn\\n$$\\nand asked to find all integer pairs $(m, n)$ satisfying it. Then, from the solution where $m$ and $n$ have opposite signs (i.e., one positive and one negative), we define $k = n - 1$, where $n$ is the **positive** integer in such a pair.\\n\\n#### Step 1: Try small values\\n\\nLet’s consider the case where $m < 0$ and $n > 0$. Let $m = -a$, with $a > 0$, so the equation becomes:\\n$$\\n(-a)^5 - n^5 = 16(-a)n \\\\Rightarrow -a^5 - n^5 = -16an \\\\Rightarrow a^5 + n^5 = 16an\\n$$\\n\\nTry $a = 2$, $n = 2$:\\n$$\\n2^5 + 2^5 = 32 + 32 = 64,\\\\quad 16 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 2 = 64\\n$$\\nSo this works. Thus, $m = -2$, $n = 2$ is a valid solution.\\n\\nCheck if there are other solutions:\\n- For $a = 1$, $n^5 + 1 = 16n$: no integer solutions.\\n- For $a = 3$, $n^5 + 243 = 48n$: no integer solutions.\\n- Similarly for higher values, the left-hand side grows much faster than the right-hand side.\\n\\nThus, the only solution with opposite signs is $(-2, 2)$, and since $n = 2$ is the positive integer in this pair, we compute:\\n$$\\nk = n - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Part 2: Minimizing the Expression**\\n\\nWe are given a cubic polynomial:\\n$$\\nx^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48\\n$$\\nwith three **positive real roots** $p < q < r$, and we are to minimize the expression:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{k}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}\\n$$\\nwhere $k = 1$ from Part 1.\\n\\nThis simplifies to minimizing:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}\\n$$\\nsubject to the constraint that $pqr = 48$ (from Vieta's formula).\\n\\n#### Step 1: Use Lagrange Multipliers\\n\\nDefine:\\n$$\\nf(p, q, r) = \\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r},\\\\quad g(p, q, r) = pqr - 48 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nUsing Lagrange multipliers:\\n$$\\n\\\\nabla f = \\\\lambda \\\\nabla g\\n$$\\nCompute partial derivatives:\\n- $\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial p} = -\\\\frac{1}{p^2}$, $\\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial p} = qr$\\n- $\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial q} = -\\\\frac{2}{q^2}$, $\\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial q} = pr$\\n- $\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial r} = -\\\\frac{3}{r^2}$, $\\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial r} = pq$\\n\\nEquating ratios:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{-1/p^2}{qr} = \\\\frac{-2/q^2}{pr} = \\\\frac{-3/r^2}{pq}\\n$$\\nSolving these gives:\\n$$\\nq = 2p,\\\\quad r = 3p\\n$$\\nSubstitute into the constraint $pqr = 48$:\\n$$\\np(2p)(3p) = 6p^3 = 48 \\\\Rightarrow p^3 = 8 \\\\Rightarrow p = 2\\n$$\\nThen:\\n$$\\nq = 4,\\\\quad r = 6\\n$$\\n\\nNow compute the expression:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r} = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\n$$\\n\\n#### Step 2: Confirm Minimum via AM-GM\\n\\nLet $x = p$, $y = q/2$, $z = r/3$, then:\\n$$\\nxyz = \\\\frac{pqr}{6} = \\\\frac{48}{6} = 8\\n$$\\nand the expression becomes:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{x} + \\\\frac{1}{y} + \\\\frac{1}{z}\\n$$\\nBy AM-GM:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{x} + \\\\frac{1}{y} + \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\geq 3 \\\\sqrt[3]{\\\\frac{1}{xyz}} = 3 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\n$$\\nEquality holds when $x = y = z = 2$, i.e., $p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$, confirming the minimum value is indeed $\\\\frac{3}{2}$.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Final Answer**\\n\\nThe minimum possible value of $\\\\frac{k}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$ is $\\\\frac{3}{2}$, which is the exact value required.\", \"answer\": \"3/2\"}",
