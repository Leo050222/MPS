First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill 11. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The system of equations is solved by expressing y and z in terms of x using the third equation. Subtracting the first two equations gives (x - 1)(z - y) = 11. Using y + z = 19 - x and solving leads to a quadratic equation x² - 18x + 72 = 0 with roots x = 6 and x = 12. The smaller root for x + 1 is 7 (x = 6). Substituting x = 6 into the equations gives z = 38/5. Thus, k = z + 17/5 = 55/5 = 11.\\n\\nProblem 2: Alice (skill 11) plays games against lower-skilled players (1-10) and higher-skilled players (12-21). For each lower-skilled player, the probability Alice plays them is 1/11 (due to symmetry with 10 higher-skilled players). With 10 lower-skilled players, the expected games against them is 10/11. Alice always plays exactly one game against a higher-skilled player (the first one encountered), contributing 1. Total expectation: 10/11 + 1 = 21/11.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"21/11\"\n}",
