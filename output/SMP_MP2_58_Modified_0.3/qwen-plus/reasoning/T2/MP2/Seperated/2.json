      "A1036": "Let $m, n > 2$ be integers. One of the angles of a regular $n$-gon is dissected into $m$ angles of equal size by $(m-1)$ rays. If each of these rays intersects the polygon again at one of its vertices, we say $n$ is $m$-cut. Compute the smallest positive integer $n$ that is both 3-cut and 4-cut. Instead of computing the smallest positive integer $n$ that is both 3-cut and 4-cut, simply find $k = t - \\frac{23}{2}$, where $t$ is the least common multiple of 3 and 4, where this is the smallest positive integer divisible by both values of $m$ in the required cut conditions."

Alice places an apple beneath one of the points, then picks five of the other seven points and reveals that none of them are hiding the apple. Bob then drops a bomb on any of the points, and destroys the apple if he drops the bomb either on the point containing the apple or on an adjacent point. Bob wins if he destroys the apple, and Alice wins if he fails. If both players play optimally, what is the probability that Bob destroys the apple?"

Thus, k = 12 - 23/2 = (24/2 - 23/2) = 1/2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Alice places the apple at one point and reveals five non-apple points, leaving three possible points (including the apple). Bob must bomb a location covering the apple or adjacent points. Alice chooses the two decoy points to minimize Bob's success probability. By symmetry and game theory analysis, Alice can ensure that any bomb location covering two points of the remaining three covers decoys, not the apple. Bob's optimal strategy is to bomb a location covering one point, giving a success probability of 1/3 (since there are three points and only one is the apple).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/3\"\n}",
