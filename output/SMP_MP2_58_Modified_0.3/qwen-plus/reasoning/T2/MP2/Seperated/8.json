      "A1269": "Teresa the bunny has a fair 8-sided die. Seven of its sides have fixed labels $1,2, \\ldots, 7$, and the label on the eighth side can be changed and begins as 1. She rolls it several times, until each of $1,2, \\ldots, 7$ appears at least once. After each roll, if $k$ is the smallest positive integer that she has not rolled so far, she relabels the eighth side with $k$. The probability that 7 is the last number she rolls is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the specified linear combination from the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process, simply find $m = q_0 + 3999/4$, where $q_0$ is the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process derived from the recursive probability analysis of the states based on the number of distinct fixed labels collected."

By modeling the process as a sequence of phases where each phase corresponds to collecting the smallest missing number, the recurrence relation for the probability of collecting all numbers 1-6 before 7 is found. The key insight is that for each phase with m uncollected numbers in 1-6, the probability f(m) satisfies f(m) = (m+1)/(m+2) * f(m-1). Starting from f(0)=1, we compute f(6) = 1/4. The problem specifies to compute m = q_0 + 3999/4 where q_0 = 1/4, yielding m = 1/4 + 3999/4 = 4000/4 = 1000.\\n\\nProblem 2: To count triples (a,b,c) with a ≤ b ≤ c, gcd(a,b,c)=1, and abc=6^2020, we use inclusion-exclusion over the gcd. The Möbius function restricts non-zero terms to square-free divisors d=1,2,3,6. Computing f(N) for N=6^2020 and its divisions by d^3, we simplify using symmetry and modular arithmetic. The final count modulo 1000 is derived by evaluating the expression 6b^2 + 12b + 8 mod 1000 with b=1009, resulting in 602.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1000\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"602\"\n}",
