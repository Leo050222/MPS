A route is a sequence of at least two points $P_{a_{1}}, P_{a_{2}}, \\ldots, P_{a_{n}}$ such that if an ant were to visit these points in their given order, starting at $P_{a_{1}}$ and ending at $P_{a_{n}}$, by following $n-1$ straight line segments (each connecting each $P_{a_{i}}$ and $P_{a_{i+1}}$ ), it would never visit a point twice or cross its own path. Find the number of routes. Instead of determining the total number of such routes, simply find $k = r - 1092$, where $r$ is the number of valid routes starting from the designated point $P_8$."

A route is a sequence of at least two distinct points where the path does not cross itself. For any subset S containing P8 (labeled 0) with size k ≥ 2, the number of non-crossing Hamiltonian paths starting at 0 is 2^{k-2}. The total number of routes is the sum over all subsets S containing 0 of size k (from 2 to 8) of C(7, k-1) * 2^{k-2}. This sum equals (3^7 - 1)/2 = 1093. Thus, k = r - 1092 = 1093 - 1092 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: For the equilateral octagon with alternating angles α (at A,C,E,G) and β (at B,D,F,H), the area condition gives Area(octagon) = 3 * Area(ACEG). Using coordinate geometry and shoelace formula, we derive sin β = 4/5. Thus, m = 4, n = 5, and 100m + n = 405.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"405\"\n}",
