To maximize the smallest sector's area, the central angles must be optimized. The two diameters form four sectors with angles θ, π−θ, θ, π−θ. Adding a radius splits one sector. The maximum minimal central angle is π/3, leading to sector area (π/3)/2 = π/6. Thus, a=1, b=6. The problem asks for k = b + 4 = 10.\\n\\nProblem 2: Find the smallest integer >10 where base 10 digit sum equals base 17 digit sum. Checking numbers, N=153: base 10 sum=1+5+3=9; base 17 is 9*17 + 0, sum=9+0=9. This is the first valid number.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"153\"\n}",
