      "A3322": "A rubber band is 4 inches long. An ant begins at the left end. Every minute, the ant walks one inch along rightwards along the rubber band, but then the band is stretched (uniformly) by one inch. For what value of $n$ will the ant reach the right end during the $n$th minute? Instead of determining the minute during which the ant reaches the right end, simply find $e = p + \\frac{23}{4}$, where $p$ is the portion of the rubber band's length traversed by the ant during the first minute accounting for the uniform stretch."

Stretching occurs after the minute, but the portion traversed during the minute is based on the band's length at that time. Thus, p = 1/4. Calculating e = p + 23/4 = 1/4 + 23/4 = 24/4 = 6.\\n\\nProblem 2: For six students, the valid permutations where no student has to pass anyone are those formed by inserting each subsequent student at either end, totaling 2^(6-1) = 32 permutations. Total permutations = 720. Probability of no passing = 32/720 = 2/45. Thus, the probability that some student has to pass is 1 - 2/45 = 43/45.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"43/45\"\n}",
