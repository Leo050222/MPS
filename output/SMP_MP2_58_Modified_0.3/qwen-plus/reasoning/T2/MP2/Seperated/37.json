If $A X=6, X Y=4$, and $Y E=7$, then the area of pentagon $A B C D E$ can be written as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are integers, $c$ is positive, $b$ is square-free, and $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$. Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of determining the encoded numerical representation of the pentagon's area in radical form, simply find $k = CE - 8$, where $CE$ is the common length of the specified equal chords derived from the given segment lengths along the intersecting lines."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: In cyclic convex pentagon $ABCDE$ with $AC = BD = CE$, intersecting chords theorems and congruent triangles from equal arcs give $AX = DX = 6$ (since $AB = CD$ implies congruent triangles $AXB$ and $DXC$). Thus, $XD = 6$, so $YD = XD - XY = 6 - 4 = 2$. Let $CX = x$, then $BX = x$ (from congruence), $BD = x + 6$, and $AC = 6 + x$. Using intersecting chords at $Y$: $(x + 4) \\\\cdot 2 = (x - 1) \\\\cdot 7$, solving gives $x = 3$. Thus, $CE = AC = 9$, so $k = CE - 8 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Unit square $ABCD$ with $A(0,0)$, $B(1,0)$, $C(1,1)$, $D(0,1)$. Circle tangent to $AB$ at $E(h,0)$ has center $(h, 32/49)$. Distance from center to $D(0,1)$ equals radius: $h^2 + (1 - 32/49)^2 = (32/49)^2$. Solving gives $h^2 = 15/49$, so $DE = \\\\sqrt{h^2 + 1} = \\\\sqrt{64/49} = 8/7$. Thus, $m = 8$, $n = 7$, and $100m + n = 807$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"807\"\n}",
