  "math_problem": "$A B C D E$ is a cyclic convex pentagon, and $A C=B D=C E . A C$ and $B D$ intersect at $X$, and $B D$ and $C E$ intersect at $Y$. If $A X=6, X Y=4$, and $Y E=7$, then the area of pentagon $A B C D E$ can be written as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are integers, $c$ is positive, $b$ is square-free, and $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$. Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of determining the encoded numerical representation of the pentagon's area in radical form, simply find $k = CE - 8$, where $CE$ is the common length of the specified equal chords derived from the given segment lengths along the intersecting lines. Let $A B C D$ be a unit square. A circle with radius $\\frac{32}{49}$ passes through point $D$ and is tangent to side $A B$ at point $E$. Then $D E=\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=k$. Find $100 m+n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two parts. First, we need to find $ k = CE - 8 $ where $ CE $ is the common length of chords $ AC = BD = CE $ in a cyclic pentagon. Given $ AX = 6 $, $ XY = 4 $, and $ YE = 7 $, we use the Power of a Point theorem at intersections $ X $ and $ Y $.\\n\\nLet $ CE = t $. For point $ X $ (intersection of $ AC $ and $ BD $):\\n$$\\nAX \\\\cdot XC = BX \\\\cdot XD \\\\implies 6(t - 6) = p(t - p)\\n$$\\nFor point $ Y $ (intersection of $ BD $ and $ CE $):\\n$$\\nBY \\\\cdot YD = CY \\\\cdot YE \\\\implies (p + 4)(t - p - 4) = 7(t - 7)\\n$$\\nSolving these equations yields $ t = 9 $ or $ t = 17 $. To determine the correct value, we consider the second part of the problem involving a unit square.\\n\\nIn the unit square $ ABCD $, a circle with radius $ \\\\frac{32}{49} $ is tangent to $ AB $ at $ E $ and passes through $ D $. The center of the circle is $ (h, r) $, where $ r = \\\\frac{32}{49} $. Using the distance formula:\\n$$\\nh^2 + (r - 1)^2 = r^2 \\\\implies h^2 = 2r - 1 = \\\\frac{15}{49}\\n$$\\nThus, $ DE = \\\\sqrt{h^2 + 1} = \\\\frac{8}{7} $, so $ m = 8 $, $ n = 7 $, and $ \\\\gcd(8, 7) = 1 $. Since $ \\\\gcd(m, n) = k $, we have $ k = 1 $, implying $ CE - 8 = 1 \\\\implies CE = 9 $.\\n\\nFinally, $ 100m + n = 100 \\\\cdot 8 + 7 = 807 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"807\"\n}",
