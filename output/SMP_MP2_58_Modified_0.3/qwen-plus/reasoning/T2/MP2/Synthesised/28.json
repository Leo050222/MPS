There are 21 competitors with distinct skill levels numbered $1,2, \\ldots, 21$. They participate in a pingpong tournament as follows. First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill $k$. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the system of equations:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\nxy + z &= 40 \\\\\\\\\\nxz + y &= 51 \\\\\\\\\\nx + y + z &= 19\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Solve the System of Equations\\n\\nFrom the third equation, express $ y + z = 19 - x $. Substitute into the first two equations.\\n\\n- From the first equation: $ z = 40 - xy $\\n- Plug into the third: $ x + y + (40 - xy) = 19 \\\\Rightarrow x + y - xy = -21 \\\\Rightarrow (x - 1)(y - 1) = 22 $\\n\\nThis is a key factorization. Similarly, from the second equation:\\n\\n- $ y = 51 - xz = 51 - x(40 - xy) = 51 - 40x + x^2y \\\\Rightarrow y(1 - x^2) = 51 - 40x \\\\Rightarrow y = \\\\frac{40x - 51}{x^2 - 1} $\\n\\nAlso, from the earlier factorization:\\n\\n- $ y = \\\\frac{x + 21}{x - 1} $\\n\\nEquating both expressions for $ y $:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{x + 21}{x - 1} = \\\\frac{40x - 51}{x^2 - 1}\\n$$\\n\\nMultiply both sides by $ x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1) $:\\n\\n$$\\n(x + 21)(x + 1) = 40x - 51 \\\\Rightarrow x^2 + 22x + 21 = 40x - 51 \\\\Rightarrow x^2 - 18x + 72 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nSolving this quadratic:\\n\\n$$\\nx = \\\\frac{18 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{324 - 288}}{2} = \\\\frac{18 \\\\pm 6}{2} = 6 \\\\text{ or } 12\\n$$\\n\\nNow compute corresponding $ y $ and $ z $ values:\\n\\n- **For $ x = 6 $:**\\n  - $ y = \\\\frac{6 + 21}{6 - 1} = \\\\frac{27}{5} $\\n  - $ z = 19 - 6 - \\\\frac{27}{5} = \\\\frac{38}{5} $\\n\\n- **For $ x = 12 $:**\\n  - $ y = \\\\frac{12 + 21}{12 - 1} = \\\\frac{33}{11} = 3 $\\n  - $ z = 19 - 12 - 3 = 4 $\\n\\nSo the solutions are:\\n\\n- $ (x, y, z) = (6, \\\\frac{27}{5}, \\\\frac{38}{5}) $\\n- $ (x, y, z) = (12, 3, 4) $\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Determine $ k = z + \\\\frac{17}{5} $\\n\\nWe are told to find $ k = z + \\\\frac{17}{5} $, where $ z $ corresponds to the solution with the **smaller root for $ x + 1 $**.\\n\\n- For $ x = 6 $: $ x + 1 = 7 $\\n- For $ x = 12 $: $ x + 1 = 13 $\\n\\nThus, the smaller root is $ x = 6 $, so $ z = \\\\frac{38}{5} $\\n\\n$$\\nk = \\\\frac{38}{5} + \\\\frac{17}{5} = \\\\frac{55}{5} = 11\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Analyze the Tournament\\n\\nThere are 21 competitors with distinct skill levels from 1 to 21. Alice has skill level $ k = 11 $.\\n\\nThe tournament proceeds as follows:\\n\\n- One player is randomly chosen as active.\\n- Each round, a random inactive player is selected to challenge the current active player.\\n- The higher-skilled player wins and becomes active; the loser is eliminated.\\n- After 20 rounds, only one player remains.\\n\\nWe are to compute the **expected number of games Alice plays**.\\n\\nLet:\\n- $ m = 10 $: number of players with skill < 11 (skills 1–10)\\n- $ n = 10 $: number of players with skill > 11 (skills 12–21)\\n\\nAlice will play against a player if she is still active when that player is selected.\\n\\nUsing known results in such tournaments, the expected number of games played by a player with $ m $ players below and $ n $ players above is:\\n\\n$$\\nE = \\\\frac{m + 1}{n + 1}\\n$$\\n\\nHowever, this formula applies when the player is **initially active**. But since Alice may be initially active or inactive, we must consider both cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Compute Expected Games\\n\\n#### Case 1: Alice is Initially Active (Probability $ \\\\frac{1}{21} $)\\n\\n- Inactive players: 10 L's (skills < 11), 10 H's (skills > 11)\\n- Expected number of games Alice plays: $ \\\\frac{m + n + 1}{n + 1} = \\\\frac{21}{11} $\\n\\n#### Case 2: Alice is Initially Inactive (Probability $ \\\\frac{20}{21} $)\\n\\n- With probability $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $, initial active is a L (skills < 11):\\n  - Probability Alice plays an extra game after beating all L's: $ \\\\frac{1}{10} $\\n  - Expected games: $ 1 + \\\\frac{1}{10} = \\\\frac{11}{10} $\\n\\n- With probability $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $, initial active is a H (skills > 11):\\n  - Alice always loses her first game → Expected games: 1\\n\\nSo overall expected games when inactive:\\n\\n$$\\nE_2 = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{11}{10} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cdot 1 = \\\\frac{21}{20}\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Final Calculation\\n\\n$$\\nE = \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{21} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{21}{11} \\\\right) + \\\\left( \\\\frac{20}{21} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{21}{20} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{11} + 1 = \\\\frac{12}{11}\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"12/11\"}",
