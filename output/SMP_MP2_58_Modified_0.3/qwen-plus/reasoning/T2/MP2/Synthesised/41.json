  "math_problem": "Find all positive integers $n$ such that: \n\\[\n\\dfrac{n^3+3}{n^2+7}\n\\]\nis a positive integer. Instead of finding all positive integers making the given rational expression a positive integer, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the positive integer such that for each such positive integer, it equals the value of the expression plus $k$. Find all the values of $m$ for which the zeros of $2 x^{2}-m x-8$ differ by $|m - k|$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find positive integers $ n $ such that $ \\\\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7} $ is a positive integer. Rewrite the expression as $ n - \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $. For this to be an integer, $ n^2 + 7 $ must divide $ 7n - 3 $. Testing small values of $ n $, we find $ n = 2 $ (yields 1) and $ n = 5 $ (yields 4) are solutions. For each $ n $, $ n = \\\\text{expression value} + k $. Solving $ 2 = 1 + k $ and $ 5 = 4 + k $ gives $ k = 1 $. \\n\\nNext, find $ m $ such that the zeros of $ 2x^2 - mx - 8 $ differ by $ |m - k| = |m - 1| $. The difference of zeros is $ \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\right)^2 + 16} $. Setting this equal to $ |m - 1| $ and solving $ \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16} = |m - 1| $ leads to $ 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0 $. Solving gives $ m = 6 $ and $ m = -\\\\frac{10}{3} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6, -10/3\"\n}",
