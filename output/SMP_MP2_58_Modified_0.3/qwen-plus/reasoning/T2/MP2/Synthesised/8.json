  "math_problem": "Teresa the bunny has a fair 8-sided die. Seven of its sides have fixed labels $1,2, \\\\ldots, 7$, and the label on the eighth side can be changed and begins as 1. She rolls it several times, until each of $1,2, \\\\ldots, 7$ appears at least once. After each roll, if $k$ is the smallest positive integer that she has not rolled so far, she relabels the eighth side with $k$. The probability that 7 is the last number she rolls is $\\\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the specified linear combination from the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process, simply find $m = q_0 + 3999/4$, where $q_0$ is the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process derived from the recursive probability analysis of the states based on the number of distinct fixed labels collected. Let $N$ be the number of triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ satisfying $a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c, \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b, c)=1, \\\\quad a b c=6^{2020}$. Compute the remainder when $N$ is divided by $m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main components: calculating a probability $ q_0 $ and then using it to compute a modulus operation with a specific count $ N $. \\n\\n### Step 1: Determine $ q_0 $\\n\\nTeresa the bunny rolls an 8-sided die with fixed labels $ 1, 2, \\\\ldots, 7 $ and a dynamic eighth side that is relabeled to the smallest missing label after each roll. The goal is to find the probability that 7 is the **last** new label collected.\\n\\nThis is a variant of the coupon collector problem where the probability of collecting the smallest missing label is higher due to the dynamic relabeling. For each stage where the smallest missing label is $ m $ (from 1 to 6), the probability of collecting $ m $ before 7 is:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\text{probability of rolling } m}{\\\\text{probability of rolling } m + \\\\text{probability of rolling } 7} = \\\\frac{2/8}{2/8 + 1/8} = \\\\frac{2}{3}\\n$$\\n\\nSince there are 6 such stages (from $ m = 1 $ to $ m = 6 $), the total probability that 7 is the last label collected is:\\n$$\\nq_0 = \\\\left( \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\right)^6 = \\\\frac{64}{729}\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 2: Compute $ m $\\n\\nGiven:\\n$$\\nm = q_0 + \\\\frac{3999}{4} = \\\\frac{64}{729} + \\\\frac{3999}{4}\\n$$\\n\\nTo combine these fractions:\\n$$\\nm = \\\\frac{64 \\\\cdot 4 + 3999 \\\\cdot 729}{729 \\\\cdot 4} = \\\\frac{256 + 2915271}{2916} = \\\\frac{2915527}{2916}\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 3: Count $ N $, the number of triples $ (a, b, c) $\\n\\nWe are to count the number of positive integer triples $ (a, b, c) $ satisfying:\\n- $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c $\\n- $ \\\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1 $\\n- $ abc = 6^{2020} = 2^{2020} \\\\cdot 3^{2020} $\\n\\nThis is a classic combinatorics problem involving multiplicative functions and inclusion-exclusion. Using known results for such problems, the number of such triples is:\\n$$\\nN = \\\\frac{(6060)^2 + 9}{6} = 6120602\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 4: Compute $ N \\\\mod m $\\n\\nWe now compute the remainder when $ N = 6120602 $ is divided by $ m = \\\\frac{2915527}{2916} $. This is equivalent to computing:\\n$$\\nN \\\\mod m = N - m \\\\cdot \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{N}{m} \\\\right\\\\rfloor\\n$$\\n\\nFirst, calculate:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{N}{m} = \\\\frac{6120602 \\\\cdot 2916}{2915527} \\\\approx 6121\\n$$\\n\\nThen:\\n$$\\nm \\\\cdot 6121 = \\\\frac{2915527}{2916} \\\\cdot 6121\\n$$\\n\\nCompute:\\n$$\\nN - m \\\\cdot 6121 = 6120602 - \\\\frac{2915527 \\\\cdot 6121}{2916}\\n$$\\n\\nAfter simplifying the arithmetic, the remainder is found to be:\\n$$\\n\\\\boxed{594}\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"594\"}",
