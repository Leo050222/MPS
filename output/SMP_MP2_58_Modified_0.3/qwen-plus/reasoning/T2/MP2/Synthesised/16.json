  "math_problem": "The numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 10$ are randomly arranged in a circle. Let $p$ be the probability that for every positive integer $k<10$, there exists an integer $k^{\\prime}>k$ such that there is at most one number between $k$ and $k^{\\prime}$ in the circle. If $p$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing one hundred times the numerator plus the denominator when the probability is expressed as a reduced fraction, simply find $k = p + \\frac{167}{90}$, where $p$ is the probability for the circular arrangement satisfying the given condition. Find all real solutions $(x, y)$ of the system $x^{k}+y=12=y^{k}+x$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding $ k = p + \\\\frac{167}{90} $, where $ p $ is the probability that a circular arrangement of numbers $ 1 $ to $ 10 $ satisfies the given condition. Through analysis, it is determined that the only valid value for $ k $ that simplifies the system $ x^k + y = 12 = y^k + x $ to solvable real solutions is $ k = 2 $. This is because $ p = \\\\frac{13}{90} $, leading to $ k = \\\\frac{13}{90} + \\\\frac{167}{90} = \\\\frac{180}{90} = 2 $. Solving the system with $ k = 2 $ yields four real solutions by considering symmetric cases and quadratic equations.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(3, 3), (-4, -4), ((1 + 3√5)/2, (1 - 3√5)/2), ((1 - 3√5)/2, (1 + 3√5)/2)\"\n}",
