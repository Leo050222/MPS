  "math_problem": "A rubber band is 4 inches long. An ant begins at the left end. Every minute, the ant walks one inch along rightwards along the rubber band, but then the band is stretched (uniformly) by one inch. For what value of $n$ will the ant reach the right end during the $n$th minute? Instead of determining the minute during which the ant reaches the right end, simply find $p$, where $p$ is the portion of the rubber band's length traversed by the ant during the first minute accounting for the uniform stretch. Let $s = p + \\frac{23}{4}$. $s$ students taking a test sit in a row of seats with aisles only on the two sides of the row. If they finish the test at random times, what is the probability that some student will have to pass by another student to get to an aisle?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ p $, the portion of the rubber band traversed by the ant during the first minute. The rubber band starts at 4 inches. The ant walks 1 inch during the first minute, which is $ \\\\frac{1}{4} $ of the band's length at that time. Stretching uniformly after the ant walks does not change the fraction of the band covered, so $ p = \\\\frac{1}{4} $. Next, compute $ s = p + \\\\frac{23}{4} = \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{23}{4} = 6 $. For 6 students in a row, the probability that some student must pass another to reach an aisle is the complement of all students being able to exit without passing. The number of valid permutations where each student can exit (either all left or all right students have finished before them) is $ 2^{n-1} $. For $ n = 6 $, this is $ 2^5 = 32 $. Total permutations are $ 6! = 720 $. The probability of no student needing to pass is $ \\\\frac{32}{720} = \\\\frac{2}{45} $. Thus, the desired probability is $ 1 - \\\\frac{2}{45} = \\\\frac{43}{45} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"43/45\"\n}",
