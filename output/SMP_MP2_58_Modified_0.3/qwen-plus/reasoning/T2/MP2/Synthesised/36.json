  "math_problem": "Eight points are chosen on the circumference of a circle, labelled $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{8}$ in clockwise order. A route is a sequence of at least two points $P_{a_{1}}, P_{a_{2}}, \\ldots, P_{a_{n}}$ such that if an ant were to visit these points in their given order, starting at $P_{a_{1}}$ and ending at $P_{a_{n}}$, by following $n-1$ straight line segments (each connecting each $P_{a_{i}}$ and $P_{a_{i+1}}$ ), it would never visit a point twice or cross its own path. Find the number of routes. Instead of determining the total number of such routes, simply find $k = r - 1092$, where $r$ is the number of valid routes starting from the designated point $P_8$. Let $A B C D E F G H$ be an equilateral octagon with $\\angle A \\cong \\angle C \\cong \\angle E \\cong \\angle G$ and $\\angle B \\cong \\angle D \\cong \\angle F \\cong \\angle H$. If the area of $A B C D E F G H$ is three times the area of $A C E G$, then $\\sin B$ can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\gcd(m, n)=k$. Find $100 m+n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the route-counting component. The task is to determine $ k = r - 1092 $, where $ r $ is the number of valid non-crossing routes starting from point $ P_8 $ on a circle with 8 labeled points.\\n\\n### Step 1: Counting Non-Crossing Routes\\n\\nWe define $ g(n) $ as the number of non-crossing paths starting at a fixed vertex in an $ n $-gon (with all points on a circle), where each path has at least two points and does not revisit any point or cross its own path.\\n\\nThis sequence satisfies the recurrence:\\n$$\\ng(n) = 3g(n-1) + 1 \\\\quad \\\\text{for } n \\\\geq 3, \\\\quad \\\\text{with } g(2) = 1\\n$$\\n\\nComputing up to $ n = 8 $:\\n- $ g(2) = 1 $\\n- $ g(3) = 3 \\\\cdot 1 + 1 = 4 $\\n- $ g(4) = 3 \\\\cdot 4 + 1 = 13 $\\n- $ g(5) = 3 \\\\cdot 13 + 1 = 40 $\\n- $ g(6) = 3 \\\\cdot 40 + 1 = 121 $\\n- $ g(7) = 3 \\\\cdot 121 + 1 = 364 $\\n- $ g(8) = 3 \\\\cdot 364 + 1 = 1093 $\\n\\nThus, $ r = g(8) = 1093 $, and so:\\n$$\\nk = r - 1092 = 1093 - 1092 = 1\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 2: Solving the Octagon Area Condition\\n\\nLet $ ABCDEFGH $ be an equilateral octagon with alternating angles $ \\\\angle A = \\\\angle C = \\\\angle E = \\\\angle G = \\\\alpha $ and $ \\\\angle B = \\\\angle D = \\\\angle F = \\\\angle H = \\\\beta $. Since the sum of interior angles in an octagon is $ 1080^\\\\circ $, we have:\\n$$\\n4\\\\alpha + 4\\\\beta = 1080^\\\\circ \\\\Rightarrow \\\\alpha + \\\\beta = 270^\\\\circ \\\\Rightarrow \\\\alpha = 270^\\\\circ - \\\\beta\\n$$\\n\\nThe area of the octagon is given to be three times the area of quadrilateral $ ACEG $. Using coordinate geometry and vector analysis, the areas are found to be:\\n- $ \\\\text{Area}_{\\\\text{octagon}} = 2(\\\\sin \\\\beta + 1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta) $\\n- $ \\\\text{Area}_{ACEG} = 2(1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta) $\\n\\nSetting $ \\\\text{Area}_{\\\\text{octagon}} = 3 \\\\cdot \\\\text{Area}_{ACEG} $:\\n$$\\n2(\\\\sin \\\\beta + 1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta) = 6(1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta)\\n\\\\Rightarrow \\\\sin \\\\beta = 2(1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta)\\n$$\\n\\nUsing trigonometric identities:\\n$$\\n\\\\sin \\\\beta = 2 \\\\sin^2(\\\\beta/2), \\\\quad 1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta = 2 \\\\sin^2(\\\\beta/2)\\n\\\\Rightarrow \\\\tan(\\\\beta/2) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\n$$\\n\\nFrom this, we compute:\\n$$\\n\\\\sin \\\\beta = \\\\frac{4}{5}\\n$$\\n\\nSince $ \\\\gcd(4, 5) = 1 $, and $ k = 1 $, this matches the condition that $ \\\\gcd(m, n) = k $.\\n\\n### Final Computation\\n\\nGiven $ \\\\sin B = \\\\frac{m}{n} = \\\\frac{4}{5} $, we find:\\n$$\\n100m + n = 100 \\\\cdot 4 + 5 = 405\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"405\"}",
