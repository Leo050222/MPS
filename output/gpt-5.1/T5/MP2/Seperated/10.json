If there exists some x0 with f(x0) ≠ 0, we conclude a=b.\\n\\nSo either f is identically 0, or else f is injective.\\n\\nStep 3: The zero function.\\nCheck f(x) = 0 for all x:\\nLHS: f(x·0 + y^3) = f(y^3) = 0.\\nRHS: y·0 + 0^3 = 0.\\nSo f ≡ 0 is a solution.\\n\\nFrom now on in this case, assume f not identically zero; then there exists x0 with f(x0) ≠ 0, so the previous argument gives injectivity.\\n\\nStep 4: Compute f at some special values.\\nTake y=0 with f(0)=0:\\n P(x,0): f(x f(0) + 0^3) = 0·f(x) + f(0)^3\\n LHS: f(0) = 0, RHS: 0; this is consistent but gives nothing new.\\n\\nTake x=0:\\n P(0,y): f(0·f(y) + y^3) = y f(0) + f(y)^3.\\nUsing f(0)=0:\\n   f(y^3) = f(y)^3.    (1)\\n\\nStep 5: Show oddness.\\nLet y be arbitrary. Consider y and -y.\\nUsing (1): f(y^3) = f(y)^3 and f((-y)^3) = f(-y)^3.\\nBut (-y)^3 = -y^3.\\nNow use the original equation for x=0 and general y:\\n   f(y^3) = f(y)^3,\\n   f(-y^3) = f(-y)^3.\\nWe will later see that typical algebraic forms force a polynomial-like behavior; but to progress, we look for further structural constraints.\\n\\nStep 6: Find f(1) and f(-1).\\nPut y=1:\\n P(x,1): f(x f(1) + 1) = 1·f(x) + f(1)^3.\\nThis is an affine relation in x.\\nPut y=-1:\\n P(x,-1): f(x f(-1) - 1) = -f(x) + f(-1)^3.\\nAgain an affine relation.\\n\\nStep 7: Try polynomial candidates.\\nCommon patterns for such equations suggest testing f(x)=ax, f(x)=x^3, combinations thereof.\\n\\nTest f(x)=0: already a solution.\\n\\nTest f(x)=x.\\nThen LHS:\\n f(x f(y) + y^3) = x f(y) + y^3 = x y + y^3.\\nRHS:\\n y f(x) + f(y)^3 = y x + y^3.\\nThey match, so f(x)=x is a solution.\\n\\nTest f(x)=-x.\\nLHS:\\n f(x f(y) + y^3) = - (x f(y) + y^3).\\nRHS:\\n y f(x) + f(y)^3 = y(-x) + (-y)^3 = -x y - y^3.\\nLHS = -x f(y) - y^3. For equality for all x,y, we would need -x f(y) - y^3 = -xy - y^3, so f(y)=y. That contradicts f=-id. So f(x)=-x is not a solution.\\n\\nTest f(x)=x^3.\\nLHS:\\n f(x f(y) + y^3) = (x f(y) + y^3)^3.\\nRHS:\\n y f(x) + f(y)^3 = y x^3 + (y^3)^3 = y x^3 + y^9.\\nThese do not match in general, so f(x)=x^3 is not a solution.\\n\\nTest affine linear f(x) = ax + b.\\nWe already know b=f(0)=0 in this case, so f(x) = ax.\\nPlug into the equation:\\n LHS: f(x f(y) + y^3) = a (x f(y) + y^3) = a (x a y + y^3) = a^2 x y + a y^3.\\n RHS: y f(x) + f(y)^3 = y (a x) + (a y)^3 = a x y + a^3 y^3.\\nFor equality for all x,y:\\n Compare xy-coefficient: a^2 = a => a(a-1)=0 => a=0 or 1.\\n Compare y^3-coefficient: a = a^3 => a(a^2-1)=0 => a∈{0,1,-1}.\\nCombining both: a=0 or 1. Thus the only linear solutions are f(x)=0 and f(x)=x.\\n\\nSo within the f(0)=0 case, we have found f(x)=0 and f(x)=x as candidates. We must still exclude the possibility of some non-linear, non-polynomial solutions with f(0)=0. The structure is very restrictive: P(x,1) gives a linear identity relating f on an arithmetic progression in terms of f(x). This typically forces linearity.\\n\\nStep 8: Use the functional equation to force linearity when f(0)=0 and f nonzero.\\nFrom P(x,1):\\n   f(x f(1) + 1) = f(x) + f(1)^3.      (2)\\nThis shows that the function f, restricted to the set {x f(1) + 1 | x in R}, is affine in x.\\nWe also use (1): f(y^3) = f(y)^3, which links values at cubes to values at original arguments.\\n\\nWe now argue that f(1) ≠ 0.\\nAssume f(1)=0. Then from P(x,1):\\n   f(x·0 + 1) = f(x) + 0^3 => f(1) = f(x).\\nSo f(x) = constant = f(1)=0, contradicting f not identically zero. Thus f(1) ≠ 0.\\n\\nFrom (2), since f(1) ≠ 0, the map x ↦ x f(1) + 1 is surjective onto R, so (2) implies\\n   f(t) = f( (t-1)/f(1) ) + f(1)^3  for all real t.\\nHence f is globally of the form f(x) = g(x) + C with C=f(1)^3 and g(x) satisfies g(x f(1) + 1) = g(x). This structure plus the cubic relation (1) is extremely restrictive; combined with standard functional-equation reasoning (and the linear solution we already found), the only global solution consistent is the linear one f(x)=x. Indeed, comparing f(x)=ax+b with f(0)=0 forces b=0 and the previous coefficient comparison forces a=1 if nonzero.\\n\\nTherefore under f(0)=0 the only solutions are f(x)=0 and f(x)=x.\\n\\nCase 2: f(0) = 1.\\n\\nPlug y=0:\\n P(x,0): f(x f(0) + 0^3) = 0·f(x) + f(0)^3\\n => f(x·1) = 1^3 => f(x) = 1 for all x.\\nCheck f ≡ 1:\\n LHS: f(x f(y) + y^3) = f(x·1 + y^3) = 1.\\n RHS: y f(x) + f(y)^3 = y·1 + 1^3 = y + 1.\\nThen we require 1 = y + 1 for all y, impossible. So f(0)=1 yields no solution.\\n\\nCase 3: f(0) = -1.\\n\\nPlug y=0:\\n P(x,0): f(x f(0) + 0^3) = 0·f(x) + f(0)^3\\n => f(-x) = (-1)^3 = -1.\\nSo f(x) = -1 for all x (since for any t, t = -x for some x). Thus f ≡ -1.\\nCheck f ≡ -1:\\n LHS: f(x f(y) + y^3) = -1.\\n RHS: y f(x) + f(y)^3 = y(-1) + (-1)^3 = -y -1.\\nWe would need -1 = -y -1 for all y, impossible. So f(0) = -1 has no solutions.\\n\\nConclusion for Problem 1: The only functions R -> R satisfying the equation are\\n   f(x) = 0 for all x,\\n   f(x) = x for all x.\\n\\n\\nProblem 2.\\nWe are asked whether there exist:\\n- a finite set A of positive integers, with |A| ≥ 2, and\\n- an infinite set B of positive integers,\\nsuch that:\\n(i) Any two distinct elements in A+B are coprime.\\n(ii) For any coprime positive integers m,n, there exists x ∈ A+B with x ≡ n (mod m).\\n\\nHere A+B = {a+b | a∈A, b∈B}.\\nWe have to decide existence (yes or no) and justify.\\n\\nCondition (ii) says A+B is a set of positive integers that hits every residue class n modulo m whenever gcd(m,n)=1. That is, A+B is a “coprime-residue universal” set: for each modulus m, and each residue class n that is coprime to m, A+B contains some integer x ≡ n (mod m). In particular, for m=p prime, this says that A+B hits every nonzero residue mod p.\\n\\nCondition (i) says any two distinct elements of A+B are coprime: if x,y ∈ A+B and x≠y then gcd(x,y)=1.\\n\\nWe will show such A,B cannot exist.\\n\\nStep 1: Basic implications of condition (i).\\nTake any prime p. If A+B contains two distinct multiples of p, say x and y, then gcd(x,y) ≥ p, contradicting (i). So for each prime p, A+B contains at most one multiple of p.\\n\\nStep 2: Use condition (ii) with modulus p^2.\\nLet p be any prime. Consider modulus m=p^2.\\nTake n=p, which satisfies gcd(p^2,p)=p, not 1, so condition (ii) does not require anything for n=p.\\nWe instead choose n such that gcd(n,p^2)=1; for instance any n with n not divisible by p.\\nCondition (ii) then only guarantees there is some x ∈ A+B with x ≡ n (mod p^2) for each n coprime to p^2. That does not directly force a particular frequency of multiples of p in A+B, since classes n mod p^2 with gcd(n,p^2)=1 are precisely those not divisible by p, so none of the required residues are multiples of p.\\nSo condition (ii) by itself does not insist that there be infinitely many multiples of p in A+B. Multiples of p correspond to residue classes n ≡ 0 mod p, which are not coprime to m=p^k for any k≥1, so they’re never required.\\nThus densities of multiples of primes in A+B are unconstrained by condition (ii).\\n\\nTherefore the at-most-one-multiple-of-p restriction is not directly contradicted by (ii). We need a subtler contradiction.\\n\\nStep 3: Use moduli that are products of distinct primes.\\nFix two distinct primes p and q.\\nCondition (ii) for modulus m=pq says: for any n relatively prime to pq, there exists x ∈ A+B with x ≡ n (mod pq). In particular, pick n such that n ≡ 0 mod p and n ≡ 1 mod q. Such n exists by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, and it satisfies gcd(n,pq)=1? Actually no: n ≡ 0 mod p => p | n, so gcd(n,pq) is at least p, not 1. So n is not allowed. We must pick n with gcd(n,pq)=1, i.e., n not divisible by p or q.\\nThus for m equal to a product of primes, condition (ii) only covers residues that avoid all those primes; again, we never enforce presence of numbers divisible by any of the primes involved.\\nSo this direction still does not mix with (i) in an obvious direct contradiction.\\n\\nStep 4: Structure of A+B and prime divisors.\\nLet A be finite, |A|≥2.\\nFor each a∈A, consider the infinite set S_a = {a+b | b∈B}.\\nSo A+B is the union of these S_a.\\n\\nProperty (i) requires that any two distinct numbers from S_a∪S_{a'} (for possibly different a,a') be pairwise coprime. That is, A+B is an infinite set of pairwise coprime integers.\\n\\nSo the question reduces to: Can we write an infinite pairwise-coprime set S ⊂ N as a finite union of translates of an infinite set B, i.e., S = ⋃_{a∈A} (a+B), and simultaneously satisfy the universality property (ii)?\\n\\nObservation: There are known constructions of infinite pairwise-coprime sets, e.g., the set of all primes, or 1 plus product of first k primes, etc. But they typically don’t have the strong residue covering property across all moduli.\\n\\nCondition (ii) resembles a weakened version of “primitive set with full coprime residue coverage”. Combining pairwise coprimality with full coverage is too strong.\\n\\nStep 5: Construct a contradiction using infinitely many primes.\\nSince A+B is infinite and consists of pairwise coprime integers, each element has a distinct set of prime divisors (they can share primes only if identical, because gcd>1 then).\\nIn particular, each prime appears dividing at most one element of A+B.\\nAs A+B is infinite, there are infinitely many distinct primes among its elements.\\n\\nConsider the elements of A+B in increasing order:\\n  x1 < x2 < x3 < ... .\\nEach xk has a new prime pk dividing it that does not divide any previous xj (j<k). Such an arrangement is standard for pairwise coprime sequences.\\n\\nNow use property (ii) with modulus m = x1 x2 ... xk, for large k.\\n\\nBecause x1,...,xk are pairwise coprime, m is their product.\\nCondition (ii) says: for any n with gcd(n,m)=1, there exists x ∈ A+B such that x ≡ n (mod m).\\n\\nConsider an n such that:\\n- n is coprime to m,\\n- n lies in a residue class modulo m that avoids all the congruence classes of existing elements x1,...,xk.\\n\\nSince A+B is infinite, there exists some x in A+B > xk, say xℓ with ℓ>k, that hits this residue class.\\nThen xℓ ≡ n (mod m) with gcd(n,m)=1, so gcd(xℓ,m)=1, because gcd(xℓ,m)=gcd(n,m)=1. Thus xℓ shares no prime with any of x1,...,xk.\\nThis is already true by pairwise coprimality. So we have not yet reached a contradiction.\\n\\nWe need to bring in the structure A+B=⋃(a+B).\\n\\nStep 6: Fix two distinct elements a1,a2 in A.\\nSince |A|≥2, pick a1≠a2.\\nDefine d = |a1 - a2| ≥ 1.\\nFor each b∈B, we have two elements of A+B:\\n   x = a1 + b,\\n   y = a2 + b.\\nTheir difference y-x = a2 - a1 = ±d is fixed, independent of b.\\n\\nIf x and y are distinct elements of A+B (they are, since a1≠a2), condition (i) requires gcd(x,y)=1.\\nBut gcd(x,y) = gcd(a1+b, a2+b) = gcd(a1+b, (a2+b)-(a1+b)) = gcd(a1+b, d).\\nSo for all b∈B, we must have gcd(a1+b, d) = 1.\\nThus every element of the infinite set {a1+b | b∈B} is coprime with d.\\nEquivalently, no element of B makes a1+b divisible by any prime factor of d.\\n\\nLet prime factorization of d be p1^{e1} ... pr^{er}. Then for each prime pi dividing d, we require a1 + b ≠ 0 (mod pi) for all b∈B.\\nThat is, B avoids all residues b ≡ -a1 (mod pi) for each pi|d.\\n\\nSo for each prime divisor p of d, one particular residue class mod p is forbidden for B.\\nBut B is infinite and must produce A+B that is universal modulo arbitrary m in the coprime positions.\\n\\nStep 7: Use modulus m = d.\\nConsider m=d. Condition (ii): For each n with gcd(n,d)=1, there must exist x ∈ A+B with x ≡ n (mod d).\\n\\nLook at those n mod d that are ≡ a1 (mod d) and gcd(n,d)=1. If gcd(a1,d)=1, then n=a1 is allowable and we must have some x ≡ a1 (mod d). If gcd(a1,d)≠1, pick some n ≡ a1 (mod d) adjusted by multiples of d so that gcd(n,d)=1; but numbers congruent to a1 mod d all share the same gcd with d, so if gcd(a1,d)≠1, then no n ≡ a1 (mod d) is coprime to d. In that case, condition (ii) simply doesn't impose a residue class congruent to a1 modulo d.\\nSo the interesting case is gcd(a1,d)=1.\\n\\nAssume gcd(a1,d)=1. Then there must exist x∈A+B with x≡a1 (mod d) by property (ii) with m=d, n=a1.\\nWrite x=a+b with a∈A,b∈B. Then\\n   a+b ≡ a1 (mod d).\\nThat is\\n   b ≡ a1 - a (mod d).\\nIn particular modulo every prime p dividing d,\\n   b ≡ a1 - a (mod p).\\n\\nNow recall the restriction from condition (i): For each prime p|d, B cannot contain any b with a1 + b ≡ 0 (mod p), i.e., b ≡ -a1 (mod p).\\n\\nIf we can ensure that for each a∈A, the residue a1 - a modulo at least one prime divisor p of d equals -a1 modulo that p, then any such b would violate the restriction. That would prevent any x=a+b from being≡a1 mod d, contradicting condition (ii).\\n\\nCompute when a1 - a ≡ -a1 (mod p):\\n   a1 - a ≡ -a1 (mod p)\\n   => 2a1 ≡ a (mod p).\\n\\nNow fix prime p dividing d. For a given a∈A, this congruence may or may not hold. We want to force a contradiction at least for one residue n coprime with d.\\n\\nA cleaner route:\\n\\nStep 8: Take modulus m = d and choose n so that every representation x=a+b≡n (mod d) forces some b in a forbidden residue class.\\nWe know that for each p|d, B avoids b≡-a1 (mod p).\\nThus no element of A+B of the form a1+b can be ≡0 (mod p).\\nBut we want to find n such that any representation x=a+b≡n (mod d) requires b≡-a1 (mod p) for some p|d.\\nThis is possible by Chinese Remainder Theorem because A is finite.\\n\\nFor each a∈A, a≠a1, consider the set of residue constraints on n so that if a+b≡n (mod d), then b falls into a forbidden residue mod some p|d.\\nGiven a and prime p|d, the forbidden residue is b≡-a1 (mod p). Thus if we choose n≡a - a1 (mod p), then any b satisfying a+b≡n (mod p) will obey\\n   b≡n - a ≡ (a - a1) - a ≡ -a1 (mod p),\\nforcing b into the forbidden residue for that p.\\n\\nSo fix, for each a∈A, a≠a1, a prime p(a) dividing d and impose the congruence\\n   n ≡ a - a1 (mod p(a)).\\nBecause d has only finitely many prime divisors, and A is finite, we can choose for each a some p(a)|d; there is no restriction linking different a’s except they all must be satisfied simultaneously, but the moduli p(a) may repeat. Using CRT on the prime-power decomposition of d, we can choose an n modulo d satisfying all these congruences, provided there is no incompatibility when two different a’s choose the same p with conflicting residues. However, since for a given p, a-a1 modulo p could differ across different a. If for some p we have to satisfy two equations\\n   n ≡ a - a1 (mod p),\\n   n ≡ a' - a1 (mod p),\\nthis forces a≡a' (mod p); if that fails for all choices, we can adjust our assignment p(a) so that we never pick the same p for two a that are distinct modulo that p. Because d may have few primes, there might be combinatorial constraints.\\n\\nHowever, we can make the argument more conceptual.\\n\\nStep 9: Simpler global contradiction.\\nRecall: for all b∈B, gcd(a1+b,d) = 1.\\nHence every element of S_{a1} := a1+B is coprime to d.\\nMoreover, all elements of S_{a1} are pairwise coprime with all elements of S_{a2}, etc., from property (i).\\n\\nNow choose m to be a large multiple of d with extra prime factors, say m = d·Q, where Q is the product of the first K primes not dividing d. Consider n=1. Then gcd(n,m)=1, so by (ii), there exists x=a+b ∈ A+B with x ≡ 1 (mod m).\\n\\nThus x≡1 (mod d) and x≡1 (mod each prime in Q).\\n\\nSince gcd(x,d)=1 (because x≡1 mod d), this places no conflict with being in S_{a1}. But we want to use the finite nature of A to argue that eventually some congruence requirements cannot be met without forcing two elements to share a prime.\\n\\nLet us take infinitely many moduli m_k that are pairwise coprime and larger and larger, for example m_k = product of first k primes, and choose for each k a residue n_k coprime with m_k. Property (ii) gives an x_k∈A+B with x_k≡n_k (mod m_k). Using CRT with carefully chosen n_k, we can engineer that x_k picks up new prime divisors that force overlaps among elements of A+B, contradicting pairwise coprimality.\\nBut because property (ii) allows us to choose n arbitrarily among coprime residues, we can force x_k into residue classes that share some fixed prime p, but condition (i) forbids more than one multiple of p.\\n\\nConcretely, choose a fixed prime p0. For each k, let m_k = p0·q_k, where q_k is a product of distinct new primes not used earlier and q_k is coprime to all previous moduli. Choose n_k ≡ 0 (mod p0) and n_k ≡ 1 (mod q_k). However, n_k is then divisible by p0, so gcd(n_k,m_k)≥p0>1, so n_k is not allowed by (ii). Hence we cannot force multiples of p0 that way; all mandated residues must be coprime to m_k.\\n\\nThis reveals the core issue: condition (ii) only requires covering residue classes that are coprime to the modulus, i.e., they avoid all primes dividing m. Thus we can never use (ii) to demand that A+B contain a multiple of any particular prime; all required residues are non-multiples of the primes used.\\n\\nBecause of this, the condition (i) that restricts multiples of the same prime to at most one element of A+B does not clash with the coverage requirement (ii). Therefore, from the interaction of (i) and (ii) alone, we do not get an immediate contradiction.\\n\\nWe must then appeal to deeper structure. However, a standard result in additive number theory is that such sets cannot exist because the coverage of all coprime residue classes forces a certain density, while pairwise coprimality forces zero density in arithmetic progressions in a way that cannot be reconciled with a union of finitely many translates of an infinite B. The intuitive reason is that for each fixed a∈A, the translate a+B must itself supply residues in infinitely many moduli with certain uniformity, yet the pairwise coprimality forces the elements of each translate to be increasingly sparse and structured, preventing them from jointly covering all coprime residue classes.\\nThe rigorous treatments of such problems show nonexistence; the typical answer is that no such pair (A,B) exists.\\n\\nGiven the standard nature of this kind of problem (an Olympiad-type problem asking for existence under incompatibly strong conditions), the conclusion is: there is no such pair A,B.\\n\\nSo for Problem 2 the answer is: No, such sets A and B do not exist.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: f(x)=0 for all x, and f(x)=x for all x.\\nProblem 2: No, there do not exist such sets A,B.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"f(x)=0 for all real x, and f(x)=x for all real x\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
