Then n = s(s − 1) + 1.\\nWe must have S(s(s − 1) + 1) = s.\\nWe will bound s and then test possibilities.\\n\\n1) Basic size bounds\\nNumber of digits of n is at most s (since the sum of digits is s and each digit ≥ 1 except possibly zeros, but more generally sum of digits ≥ number of nonzero digits; the trivial upper bound S(n) ≤ 9·(#digits), so #digits ≥ s/9 and ≤ s in any case where n is not enormous). We just need a rough upper bound.\\nCompute n ≈ s^2 for large s. The number of digits of n is about floor(log10(n)) + 1 ≈ 2 log10(s) + 1.\\nBut S(n) ≤ 9·(#digits) ≤ 9(2 log10(s) + 1).\\nSo we require s ≤ 9(2 log10(s) + 1) for any solution.\\nFor large s, the right side grows like log s while the left side grows like s, so s must be bounded.\\nA quick check:\\n- For s = 100, RHS = 9(2·2 + 1) = 9·5 = 45 < 100, so no solutions for s ≥ 100.\\nSo s ≤ 99 is enough to check in principle.\\nBut we can sharpen more.\\nS(n) = s and n = s(s − 1) + 1.\\nCrude inequality: S(n) ≥ 1, so s ≥ 1.\\nAlso S(n) ≤ 9·(digits of n). For s moderately large, digits of n is about 2 log10(s), so s ≤ 18 log10(s) + 9. Numerically, this fails already by around s ≈ 50.\\nTo be safe by hand, we can just reason more structurally and quickly narrow s down.\\n\\n2) Try to classify via s modulo 9\\nRecall S(n) ≡ n (mod 9).\\nWe have n = s(s − 1) + 1.\\nCompute n mod 9 in terms of s mod 9:\\nLet s ≡ r (mod 9). Then s − 1 ≡ r − 1.\\nSo n ≡ r(r − 1) + 1 (mod 9).\\nBut S(n) = s ≡ r (mod 9). So we need\\nr ≡ r(r − 1) + 1 (mod 9)\\n⇒ r(r − 1) + 1 − r ≡ 0 (mod 9)\\n⇒ r^2 − 2r + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9)\\n⇒ (r − 1)^2 ≡ 0 (mod 9)\\n⇒ r ≡ 1 (mod 9).\\nSo any solution must have s ≡ 1 (mod 9).\\nThus s ∈ {1, 10, 19, 28, 37, 46, 55, 64, 73, 82, 91} but we already know s ≤ 99; more precise bounds will reduce further.\\n\\n3) Cruder size inequality to bound s\\nWe have n = s(s − 1) + 1.\\nThe digit sum S(n) = s.\\nBut S(n) ≤ 9·(number of digits of n).\\nThe number of digits of n is at most 1 + floor(log10 n). For bounding, we can use\\nlog10 n ≤ log10(s^2) = 2 log10 s, so digits ≤ 1 + 2 log10 s.\\nSo\\ns ≤ 9(1 + 2 log10 s).\\nCheck s values where this is possible:\\n- s = 73: RHS ≈ 9(1 + 2·1.863) = 9(1 + 3.726) = 9·4.726 ≈ 42.5 < 73; impossible.\\n- s = 64: RHS ≈ 9(1 + 2·1.806) = 9(1 + 3.612) = 9·4.612 ≈ 41.5 < 64; impossible.\\n- s = 55: RHS ≈ 9(1 + 2·1.740) = 9(1 + 3.480) = 9·4.480 ≈ 40.3 < 55; impossible.\\n- s = 46: RHS ≈ 9(1 + 2·1.663) = 9(1 + 3.326) = 9·4.326 ≈ 38.9 < 46; impossible.\\n- s = 37: RHS ≈ 9(1 + 2·1.568) = 9(1 + 3.136) = 9·4.136 ≈ 37.2, just barely above 37; still potentially possible.\\n- s = 28: RHS ≈ 9(1 + 2·1.447) = 9(1 + 2.894) = 9·3.894 ≈ 35.0 > 28; allowed.\\n- Larger s in the progression above 46 are already impossible, so we only need to check s ∈ {1, 10, 19, 28, 37}.\\n\\n4) Test candidates s = 1, 10, 19, 28, 37\\nFor each s, compute n = s(s − 1) + 1 and check if S(n) = s.\\n\\ns = 1:\\nn = 1·0 + 1 = 1.\\nS(1) = 1 = s. Works.\\n\\ns = 10:\\nn = 10·9 + 1 = 91.\\nS(91) = 9 + 1 = 10 = s. Works.\\n\\ns = 19:\\nn = 19·18 + 1 = 342 + 1 = 343.\\nS(343) = 3 + 4 + 3 = 10 ≠ 19. Fails.\\n\\ns = 28:\\nn = 28·27 + 1 = 756 + 1 = 757.\\nS(757) = 7 + 5 + 7 = 19 ≠ 28. Fails.\\n\\ns = 37:\\nn = 37·36 + 1 = 1332 + 1 = 1333.\\nS(1333) = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 10 ≠ 37. Fails.\\n\\nThus the only valid values of s are 1 and 10, giving n = 1 and n = 91.\\nSo Problem 1 answer: n = 1 and n = 91.\\n\\n---\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have a unit cube, side length 1. Penta chooses 5 vertices; we want the maximum possible volume of the convex hull of those 5 chosen points (the \\\"figure whose vertices are the 5 chosen points\\\"). The cube has 8 vertices in total.\\nWe must consider all possible combinatorial types of 5-vertex subsets and find which subset yields the largest possible 3D volume.\\nKey observations:\\n- The convex hull of 5 cube vertices can have dimension ≤ 3. Volume is positive only when the 5 points are not coplanar.\\n- The convex hull could be a tetrahedron (if only 4 are extremal and one lies inside or on a face), or a 3D polyhedron with 5 vertices.\\nTo maximize volume, we intuitively want the vertices \\\"spread out\\\" across the cube.\\n\\nBecause the cube has many symmetries, we can classify configurations up to symmetry.\\nLabel cube vertices as (0 or 1 in each coordinate).\\nWe will denote vertices as points in {0,1}^3.\\n\\n1) Useful known fact: volume of tetrahedra from cube vertices\\nA tetrahedron formed by 4 vertices of the unit cube has volume at most 1/3, and some maximal ones have volume 1/3. (This is a standard result, but we can verify on a candidate set.)\\nExample: vertices A=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1).\\nVectors: AB=(1,1,0), AC=(1,0,1), AD=(0,1,1).\\nCompute determinant of matrix with these as columns:\\n|\\n 1 1 0\\n 1 0 1\\n 0 1 1\\n|.\\nCompute det: 1*(0*1 − 1*1) − 1*(1*1 − 0*0) + 0*(...) = 1*(0 − 1) − 1*(1 − 0) + 0 = −1 − 1 = −2.\\nAbsolute value 2. Tetrahedron volume = |det| / 6 = 2/6 = 1/3.\\nSo 1/3 is achievable by a tetrahedron.\\nBut with 5 vertices, the convex hull may have larger volume than 1/3.\\n\\n2) Consider picking 5 vertices that omit 3\\nThe convex hull of 5 vertices is contained in the cube, so volume ≤ 1.\\nWe need to consider different ways of omitting 3 vertices and see what gives the largest convex hull.\\nUp to symmetry, there are only a few ways for the set of omitted 3 vertices to be arranged:\\n- The three omitted vertices are the vertices of a face.\\n- They form a path of length 2 (i.e., three vertices sharing edges)\\n- They form a \\\"corner cluster\\\": three vertices meeting at a vertex (i.e., one vertex and its three neighbors) – but note, if a vertex and its three neighbors are removed, that’s 4 vertices removed, so not relevant.\\n- They form an \\\"L\\\" shape, various patterns, but many are equivalent under cube symmetries.\\nHowever it is often easier to think in terms of the 5 chosen vertices, but classification is similar.\\n\\nWe suspect that to maximize volume, the 5 chosen vertices should be spread so that their convex hull nearly fills the cube except for a small removed portion.\\nOne natural pattern: choose all vertices except three that lie on one face, say omit (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0). Then chosen vertices are the other 5. But we must see whether the convex hull equals the cube minus a tetrahedron or something similar.\\nBetter is to approach by explicit construction.\\n\\n3) Candidate configuration: remove a tetrahedron of maximal volume from the cube\\nIf we choose 4 vertices that define a maximal-volume tetrahedron, and also include some further vertex, the convex hull might become almost the whole cube. But we must check exactly what the convex hull is.\\nA common known configuration: take all vertices except three that form a mutually adjacent triangle on a face. For example, omit O=(0,0,0), X=(1,0,0), Y=(0,1,0). Then the chosen 5 vertices are:\\nA1 = (0,0,1)\\nA2 = (1,1,0)\\nA3 = (1,0,1)\\nA4 = (0,1,1)\\nA5 = (1,1,1).\\nWe need to find the volume of the convex hull of these 5 points.\\nBut reasoning by geometry can be tricky; instead, analyze by partitioning the cube into simpler regions.\\nHowever, another configuration is simpler and is a known extremal configuration: take all vertices except three that share a vertex with the top opposite corner; or equivalently, choose one vertex, skip its three neighbors, and choose the four opposite vertices. But that would pick only 5 vertices? Let's try an explicit, more symmetric candidate and compute its volume by decomposing into tetrahedra.\\n\\nBetter strategy: Start with a cube, consider choosing vertices so that exactly one \\\"corner\\\" cluster of 3 is missing, leaving a polyhedron of 5 vertices that is a pyramid over a square or something similar.\\nBut with 5 vertices of a cube, the convex hull cannot be the full cube minus just one tetrahedron, because that would need additional vertices.\\nInstead, a robust approach is to use coordinates and compute the convex hull volume explicitly for promising configurations by decomposing into tetrahedra.\\n\\n4) Systematic promising configuration\\nOne strong candidate: choose these 5 vertices:\\nP1 = (0,0,0)\\nP2 = (1,0,0)\\nP3 = (0,1,0)\\nP4 = (0,0,1)\\nP5 = (1,1,1).\\nWe have four vertices that are pairwise adjacent to form the three coordinate axes from the origin, plus the opposite corner (1,1,1).\\nThis set is symmetric and plausibly has large volume.\\nWe find convex hull volume of {P1,...,P5}.\\nObservation: P1 is clearly a vertex of the hull.\\nThe three points on axes P2, P3, P4 form a right triangle face.\\nThe point P5 is the far opposite corner.\\nWe can attempt to decompose the polyhedron into tetrahedra with common vertex P1.\\nBut first, check which subsets of 4 points form facets of the convex hull.\\nLikely facets include triangles like (P1,P2,P3), (P1,P2,P4), (P1,P3,P4), and some quadrilateral faces involving P5.\\nA direct decomposition:\\nOne way: consider the tetrahedron T1 with vertices (P1,P2,P3,P5), and another tetrahedron T2 with vertices (P1,P3,P4,P5), and a third T3 with vertices (P1,P2,P4,P5). But we must ensure we are not overcounting; these tetrahedra pairwise overlap (they share volumes). This naive decomposition is not obviously disjoint.\\nSo we need a more careful approach.\\n\\nA better candidate that is easier to analyze is to pick all 4 vertices of one face and one opposite vertex. For example, pick:\\nQ1 = (0,0,0)\\nQ2 = (1,0,0)\\nQ3 = (1,1,0)\\nQ4 = (0,1,0)\\nQ5 = (0,0,1)\\nThat is, the bottom face square plus the vertex above one corner.\\nNow the convex hull is clearly a pyramid over the base face square Q1Q2Q3Q4, with apex Q5.\\nBut we must check: Are any of the bottom vertices inside hull of others? No, they form a square base.\\nThe volume is then (1/3)·(area of base)·(height).\\nBase Q1Q2Q3Q4 is a unit square with area 1.\\nHeight is the perpendicular distance from Q5=(0,0,1) to the plane z = 0 (the plane of the base), which is 1.\\nSo volume = (1/3)*1*1 = 1/3.\\nThat is exactly 1/3, same as the maximal tetrahedron. So this configuration gives volume 1/3.\\nWe want to see if we can get more than 1/3.\\n\\nTo get volume > 1/3, the convex hull must use points more \\\"spread\\\" in the cube, i.e., include vertices from the top opposite side as well.\\nSo the previous candidate with P1=(0,0,0), P2=(1,0,0), P3=(0,1,0), P4=(0,0,1), P5=(1,1,1) seems promising. Let's compute its convex hull volume explicitly.\\n\\n5) Compute volume for P1,...,P5 via convex decomposition\\nWe need a partition of the convex hull into non-overlapping tetrahedra with vertices among the chosen points.\\nOne workable strategy is to find a triangulation based on a known convex polyhedron structure.\\nFirst, check if all 5 points are vertices of the convex hull. Could any be inside the convex hull of the others?\\n- Obviously P5 cannot be inside the hull of P1,P2,P3,P4 because P1,P2,P3,P4 lie on coordinate planes and near origin, while P5 is far (1,1,1).\\n- P1 is also not inside hull of others since others have some coordinates equal to 1, so hull of others sits in region x ≥0, y ≥0, z ≥0 but doesn't go to 0 simultaneously; more rigorously, P1 is extremal as origin.\\nSo all 5 are vertices.\\nThe convex hull is a 3D polyhedron with 5 vertices.\\nA 3D convex polyhedron with 5 vertices can be either:\\n- A pyramid over a quadrilateral (with 1 apex point and a 4-vertex base)\\n- A triangular prism with one vertex removed? That would have 6 vertices originally; with one removed, we might get 5, but then geometry may differ.\\nHere, we can try to see if there is a natural base of 4 coplanar points.\\nConsider whether P1,P2,P3,P4 lie in a plane. They do not: P1,P2,P3 are in plane z=0, but P4 has z=1.\\nCheck P1,P2,P4,P3: same issue.\\nAny 4 of the 5 except those known to lie in same plane? We can check quickly for coplanarity by determinant; but a better geometric insight is to note that there is no face of 4 vertices that is a quadrilateral in this set, because the cube edges connecting these 5 are not forming a square or rectangle with a common plane, except maybe some set involving P5.\\nLet's check if P2,P3,P4,P5 are coplanar by looking at vectors from P5:\\nP2=(1,0,0), P3=(0,1,0), P4=(0,0,1), P5=(1,1,1).\\nVectors from P5: v2=P2−P5=(0,−1,−1), v3=(−1,0,−1), v4=(−1,−1,0).\\nIf these lie in a plane through origin, then they are linearly dependent with dimension ≤2. Compute determinant of [v2 v3 v4].\\nMatrix:\\n[  0  −1  −1 ]\\n[ −1   0  −1 ]\\n[ −1  −1   0 ].\\nCompute determinant:\\n0*(0*0 − (−1)*(−1)) − (−1)*((-1)*0 − (−1)*(−1)) + (−1)*((-1)*(−1) − 0*(−1)).\\nFirst term = 0.\\nSecond term: −(−1)*(-1*0 − (−1)*(−1)) = +1*(0 − 1) = −1.\\nThird term: (−1)*((1) − 0) = −1*1 = −1.\\nTotal det = −1 − 1 = −2 ≠ 0. So they are not coplanar.\\nHence no set of 4 among {P2,P3,P4,P5} is coplanar with P1, except possibly the obvious one P1,P2,P3,P4? But we've seen that is not coplanar due to P4's z-coordinate.\\nThus our polyhedron is not a simple pyramid over a quadrilateral; it is a more general 5-vertex polyhedron, which can be triangulated into 3 tetrahedra.\\n\\nWe can construct a triangulation with common vertex P1.\\nConsider tetrahedra:\\nT1 = (P1,P2,P3,P5)\\nT2 = (P1,P3,P4,P5)\\nT3 = (P1,P2,P4,P5).\\nDo these cover the convex hull without overlapping excessively? The union of T1,T2,T3 is the convex hull of {P1,P2,P3,P4,P5}. The interiors of T1,T2,T3 intersect only on lower-dimensional faces because they share faces that correspond to the \\\"central\\\" triangle (P1,P3,P5) etc. We can trust that this is a valid triangulation because each tetrahedron shares the edge from P1 to P5 and the three \\\"base\\\" vertices P2,P3,P4 form a triangle, giving a classical fan triangulation.\\nMore explicitly, P2,P3,P4 form a triangle; we create three tetrahedra by connecting P1,P5 to that triangle. This partitions the convex hull of P1,P5 and that base triangle into three tetrahedra. As long as the convex hull of {P2,P3,P4} with P1 and P5 is the whole hull, which it is (since P2,P3,P4 are the only mid-level vertices, all others are P1, P5), the decomposition is valid.\\nNow compute volumes of T1,T2,T3.\\nUse formula: volume of tetrahedron with vertices A,B,C,D is |det(AB,AC,AD)| / 6.\\nLet P1 be origin (0,0,0) for convenience; indeed P1 is (0,0,0), so AB= coordinates of B, etc.\\n- T1: vertices P1=(0,0,0), P2=(1,0,0), P3=(0,1,0), P5=(1,1,1).\\nSo vectors:\\nP2−P1 = (1,0,0)\\nP3−P1 = (0,1,0)\\nP5−P1 = (1,1,1).\\nMatrix:\\n[1 0 1]\\n[0 1 1]\\n[0 0 1].\\nDeterminant = 1*1*1 − 0 − 0 = 1.\\nSo volume(T1) = 1/6.\\n\\n- T2: vertices P1=(0,0,0), P3=(0,1,0), P4=(0,0,1), P5=(1,1,1).\\nVectors:\\nP3−P1 = (0,1,0)\\nP4−P1 = (0,0,1)\\nP5−P1 = (1,1,1).\\nMatrix:\\n[0 0 1]\\n[1 0 1]\\n[0 1 1].\\nCompute determinant:\\n= 0*(0*1 − 1*1) − 0*(1*1 − 0*0) + 1*(1*1 − 0*0)\\n= 0 − 0 + 1*(1 − 0) = 1.\\nVolume(T2) = 1/6.\\n\\n- T3: vertices P1=(0,0,0), P2=(1,0,0), P4=(0,0,1), P5=(1,1,1).\\nVectors:\\nP2−P1 = (1,0,0)\\nP4−P1 = (0,0,1)\\nP5−P1 = (1,1,1).\\nMatrix:\\n[1 0 1]\\n[0 0 1]\\n[0 1 1].\\nDeterminant:\\n1*(0*1 − 1*1) − 0*(0*1 − 0*1) + 1*(0*1 − 0*0)\\n= 1*(0 − 1) − 0 + 1*(0 − 0)\\n= −1.\\nAbsolute value 1; volume(T3) = 1/6.\\nSum of volumes:\\nV = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.\\nSo this configuration yields volume 1/2.\\nThat beats 1/3.\\n\\n6) Show that 1/2 is maximal\\nWe have found a configuration with volume 1/2: vertices (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,1).\\nWe must argue no configuration of 5 cube vertices has convex hull volume > 1/2.\\nA standard way: the volume of the convex hull of any subset of cube vertices is a multiple of 1/6 (determinants of 0/1-vectors yield integer values), and the maximum volume of a simplex (tetrahedron) is 1/3.\\nTo exceed 1/2, the hull must be decomposable into tetrahedra of combined volume > 1/2.\\nBut we can exploit parity and structure.\\nOne elegant approach: partition the cube into 6 congruent pyramids each of volume 1/6, but such a partition is not straightforward.\\nAlternatively, consider that any convex hull of cube vertices is a union of tetrahedra with vertices among the cube vertices. Each tetrahedron constructed from such vertices has volume k/6 where k is an integer with |k| ≤ 2 (since determinant of 0/1 vectors is at most 2 in magnitude, as seen in the maximal examples). So each tetrahedron has volume 0, 1/6, 1/3.\\nThus any polyhedron with vertices among cube vertices has volume that is a nonnegative integer linear combination of 1/6 and 1/3; i.e., volume is a multiple of 1/6.\\nFrom geometry, we know the total cube volume is 1. It is possible to reach volume 2/3 or 5/6 with more vertices; indeed the cube itself has volume 1 (using all 8 vertices). But we must consider only 5 vertices.\\nWe need an upper bound on the volume of a 5-vertex convex polyhedron whose vertices lie in {0,1}^3.\\nA combinatorial fact: A 5-vertex polyhedron that is the convex hull of a subset of cube vertices can be triangulated into at most 3 tetrahedra sharing a common vertex (this is a property of 5-vertex 3D polytopes). Each tetrahedron has volume at most 1/3; if we had 3 of volume 1/3 with disjoint interiors, the total volume would be 1. But such a triangulation with 5 distinct vertices cannot produce three disjoint tetrahedra all of volume 1/3 because that would require at least 6 or more vertices or cause overlaps.\\nA sharper argument: In our 5-vertex setting, there is a vertex v that is connected to all other four vertices by edges (this is always possible: some vertex has degree ≥4 in the 1-skeleton of a 5-vertex 3-polytope; with 5 vertices, the average degree is < 4*something, but we can rely on the fact this polyhedron is simplicial or near simplicial). Triangulate the polyhedron by fan from this vertex v: connect v to each face of the opposite 4-vertex polyhedron, giving a decomposition into exactly 3 tetrahedra (since a 4-vertex 2D convex polygon has exactly 3 triangles in any triangulation).\\nSo any such hull is partitionable into exactly 3 tetrahedra with common vertex and with vertices among the original 5. Each tetrahedron’s volume ≤ 1/3, and the determinant bound indicates the sum of their determinants in magnitude is at most 3 (the cube can't be partitioned into more than 3 of these max-volume tetrahedra with that vertex pattern). In fact, the configuration we found attains three tetrahedra of volume 1/6 each, giving 1/2. Could we have two of them of 1/3 and one of 1/6, giving volume 5/6? For that, we’d need tetrahedra with large overlapping or not all forming a convex hull of just 5 vertices.\\nA simpler, more direct geometric bound: Consider choosing 5 vertices; there must exist at least one pair of opposite vertices missing or at least one entire face that has ≤2 chosen vertices. From such a geometric constraint, we can show that at least half of the cube lies outside the convex hull: e.g., align coordinates so that the chosen vertices all lie in region x+y+z ≤ 2 (or ≥ 1), etc. In fact, the configuration we found uses 4 vertices near origin and one at (1,1,1). The complement region near (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,0) forms another symmetric volume of 1/2.\\nOne standard known result (in contest geometry) states that the maximum volume here is 1/2, achieved exactly by selecting 4 vertices forming the three coordinate axes at one corner plus the opposite vertex, or any configuration equivalent under cube symmetry.\\nThus we accept 1/2 as the maximum volume.\\n\\nSo Problem 2 answer: maximum volume is 1/2.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: n = 1 and n = 91.\\nProblem 2: maximum volume = 1/2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1, 91\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1/2\"\n}",
