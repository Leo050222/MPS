  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe seek a 4-digit perfect square n whose digits are all less than 6, and such that adding 1 to each digit yields another 4-digit perfect square.\\n\\n1) Let n be a 4-digit square: 1000 ≤ n ≤ 9999. So its square root is between 32 and 99.\\n2) All digits of n are in {0,1,2,3,4,5}. Adding 1 to each digit gives a new number m whose digits are in {1,2,3,4,5,6}; m must also be a 4-digit perfect square.\\n3) If n = abcd (in decimal), then m = (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)(d+1). We must have m = n + (1111)\\n   only when there are no carries, but here carries may occur because adding 1 to each digit is not the same as adding 1111 in arithmetic with carries. So we treat the condition purely digitwise: each digit of n increased by 1 gives the corresponding digit of m.\\n4) We narrow the square range by considering rough digit-size. If the first digit of n (thousands place) is ≤5 (since digits < 6), then n ∈ [1000,5999]. That restricts the square root k to: 32^2=1024, 77^2=5929, 78^2=6084. So k ∈ [32,77]. Thus n = k^2 with 32 ≤ k ≤ 77 and digits of k^2 all ≤5.\\n5) Similarly, m must be a 4-digit square with first digit between 1 and 6, i.e. m ∈ [2000,6999] (since the first digit is original+1 and original ≤5). Thus its root ℓ satisfies 45^2=2025 and 83^2=6889, so ℓ ∈ [45,82]. \\n6) Now we search for k in [32,77] such that k^2 has all digits in {0,…,5} and, when each digit is increased by 1, we obtain ℓ^2 with ℓ in [45,82]. Testing squares (mentally filtering by digits) we find:\\n   - 50^2 = 2500: digits 2,5,0,0 all ≤5. Adding 1 to each digit gives 3611, not a square (not 60^2=3600, not 61^2=3721).\\n   - 52^2 = 2704: digit 7 invalid (>5).\\n   - 54^2 = 2916: digits 9,6 invalid.\\n   - 55^2 = 3025: digit 6 not present, but 3,0,2,5 all ≤5; adding 1 gives 4136, not a square.\\n   - 56^2 = 3136: digit 6 and 7? Actually 3136 has 6 only (6>5) so invalid.\\n   - 57^2 = 3249: 9 invalid.\\n   - 58^2 = 3364: 6>5, 4 OK but 6 invalid.\\n   - 59^2 = 3481: 8>5 and 9>5.\\n   - 60^2 = 3600: 6>5 invalid.\\n   Continue scanning more selectively, or instead look systematically among known 4-digit squares with small digits.\\n7) Notice a promising candidate known from common squares: 2916 = 54^2 and 4356 = 66^2. Here, every digit of 2916 is less than 6, and adding 1 to each digit gives 3,10,2,7; but that has a 10 so it is not valid digitwise; we discard 2916.\\n8) Another well-known square pair: 1296 = 36^2 and 2401 = 49^2; however 9>5 in 1296, so 1296 invalid.\\n9) A more systematic approach: search squares whose digits are in {0,…,5}. Among 4-digit squares, there is 2025 = 45^2, 2116 = 46^2, 2304 = 48^2, 2500 = 50^2, 2809 = 53^2 (9 invalid), 3025 = 55^2, 3136 (6 invalid), 3249 (9 invalid), 3364 (6 invalid), 3600 (6 invalid), etc. Continuing that list: 4096 (9 invalid), 4225(>5?), it has 2,2,5 plus 4, all ≤5, so 4225 = 65^2 also qualifies. Check 4225: digits 4,2,2,5 all ≤5; adding 1 gives 5336. But 73^2=5329 and 74^2=5476, so 5336 is not a square.\\n10) Also 2025 has digits 2,0,2,5; adding 1 yields 3136, which is 56^2, and 3136 is indeed a perfect square. Check digits of 2025: all less than 6; 2025 is a 4-digit square (45^2). Then digitwise +1 gives 3136, which is 56^2. All conditions are satisfied.\\n11) Therefore n = 2025.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe know the remainders of a polynomial P(x) upon division by linear factors x-1, x-2, x-3, and we want the remainder when dividing by the cubic (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6.\\n\\n1) Let the divisor be Q(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3).\\n2) When P is divided by Q(x), the remainder R(x) must have degree at most 2: R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.\\n3) Because Q(x) has roots 1, 2, 3, we have for each r in {1,2,3} that P(r) = R(r), since Q(r)=0.\\n4) We are given:\\n   P(1) = -4,\\n   P(2) = -1,\\n   P(3) = 4.\\n   Thus R(1) = -4, R(2) = -1, R(3) = 4.\\n5) Write equations for R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c:\\n   - R(1) = a + b + c = -4.\\n   - R(2) = 4a + 2b + c = -1.\\n   - R(3) = 9a + 3b + c = 4.\\n6) Subtract the first equation from the second:\\n   (4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = -1 - (-4)\\n   3a + b = 3.\\n7) Subtract the second from the third:\\n   (9a + 3b + c) - (4a + 2b + c) = 4 - (-1)\\n   5a + b = 5.\\n8) Subtract the equation 3a + b = 3 from 5a + b = 5:\\n   (5a + b) - (3a + b) = 5 - 3\\n   2a = 2 so a = 1.\\n9) Plug a = 1 into 3a + b = 3:\\n   3(1) + b = 3 ⇒ 3 + b = 3 ⇒ b = 0.\\n10) Use a + b + c = -4:\\n    1 + 0 + c = -4 ⇒ c = -5.\\n11) Therefore the remainder is R(x) = x^2 - 5.\\n\\nSo the answers are: Problem 1: 2025; Problem 2: x^2 - 5.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2025\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"x^2-5\"\n}",
