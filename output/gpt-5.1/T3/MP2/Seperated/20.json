So (0,0) is a solution.\\nSimilarly if n = 0 ⇒ m^5 = 0 ⇒ m = 0, already included.\\nAssume m and n are nonzero. Then divide both sides by mn:\\n (m^5 - n^5)/(mn) = 16 ⇒ m^4/mn + m^3 n/mn + m^2 n^2/mn + m n^3/mn + n^4/mn = 16.\\nThat is\\n m^3/n + m^2 + m n + n^2 + n^3/m = 16.    (1)\\nLet t = m/n, so m = t n, with t rational and n ≠ 0. Substitute into original equation:\\n (t n)^5 - n^5 = 16 (t n) n ⇒ t^5 n^5 - n^5 = 16 t n^2.\\nFactor n^2:\\n n^2 (t^5 n^3 - n^3) = 16 t n^2 ⇒ t^5 n^3 - n^3 = 16 t.\\nSo\\n n^3 (t^5 - 1) = 16 t.              (2)\\nThus n^3 = 16 t / (t^5 - 1).\\nWe need m = t n and n integers, so t rational and (2) must yield integer n.\\nAlternatively, we can search over integer pairs via bounding. Observe growth: |m^5 - n^5| grows on order of max(|m|,|n|)^5 while |16mn| grows like max(|m|,|n|)^2, so only small integers can work.\\nWe do a more direct integer bounding argument: suppose |m|,|n| ≥ 3. Then\\n |m^5 - n^5| ≥ ||m|^5 - |n|^5| ≥ ||m|^5 - (|m|-1)^5| when |m|≥|n|.\\nFor k ≥ 3, k^5 - (k-1)^5 = 5k^4 -10k^3 +10k^2 -5k +1.\\nFor k ≥ 3 this is > 5k^4 -10k^3 - something, clearly larger than 16k^2 once k is a bit bigger; but to be rigorous, check k = 3,4,5 and see that the minimal possible nonzero difference between two fifth powers with magnitude at least 3^5 is already greater than 16|mn|.\\nA more straightforward approach is casework small values, since equation is very restrictive and symmetric.\\nWe systematically try small |m|,|n| values (this is what one would do computationally, but we can reason by patterns):\\n1) m = n. Then m^5 - m^5 = 0 ⇒ 16 m^2 = 0 ⇒ m = 0 ⇒ (0,0).\\n2) m = -n. Then m^5 - n^5 = (-n)^5 - n^5 = -n^5 - n^5 = -2 n^5. Right side: 16 m n = 16(-n)n = -16 n^2.\\nSo -2 n^5 = -16 n^2 ⇒ 2 n^5 = 16 n^2 ⇒ 2 n^2 (n^3 - 8) = 0 ⇒ n = 0 or n^3 = 8 ⇒ n = 2.\\nIf n=0 ⇒ (0,0) as before. If n=2, then m = -2. So (-2,2) and (2,-2) (since we only assumed m = -n; n=2 gives m=-2, or if you start with n=-m, you get (2,-2)). These satisfy equation? Check (2,-2): 2^5 - (-2)^5 = 32 - (-32) = 64,\\n16·2·(-2) = -64, so 64 ≠ -64. So that pair does not solve. For m=-n with n=2: m=-2, n=2:\\n(-2)^5 - 2^5 = -32 - 32 = -64; 16·(-2)·2 = -64, works. So only (-2,2).\\n3) Try small absolute values for one variable and solve for the other.\\nLet m = 1: 1 - n^5 = 16 n ⇒ n^5 + 16 n -1 = 0. \\nCheck integer divisors of 1 (±1):\\n n = 1: 1 +16 -1 =16 ≠0.\\n n = -1: -1 -16 -1 = -18 ≠0. So no integer n.\\nLet m = -1: (-1)^5 - n^5 = -1 - n^5 = 16(-1)n = -16 n ⇒ n^5 -16 n +1 =0.\\nTest n = ±1:\\n n=1: 1 -16 +1 = -14 ≠0.\\n n=-1: -1 +16 +1 =16 ≠0. So no integer n.\\nLet m = 2: 32 - n^5 = 32 n ⇒ n^5 +32 n -32 =0.\\nTest divisors of 32: n = ±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±16, ±32.\\n n=1: 1+32-32=1≠0.\\n n=2: 32+64-32=64≠0.\\n n=-1: -1 -32 -32 = -65≠0.\\n n=-2: -32 -64 -32 = -128≠0.\\n Bigger magnitudes will make |n^5| dominate, so no root.\\nLet m = -2: (-32) - n^5 = -32 n ⇒ n^5 -32 n +32 =0.\\nCheck divisors of 32: n = ±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±16, ±32.\\n n=1:1-32+32=1≠0.\\n n=2:32-64+32=0 ⇒ n=2 works, giving m=-2, which we already found.\\n n=-1:-1+32+32=63≠0.\\n n=-2:-32+64+32=64≠0.\\n others have |n^5| much larger in magnitude than remaining linear terms; direct evaluation shows no equality.\\nNext test cases where |m| or |n| equals 3 or 4; a quick check:\\nTake m=3: 243 - n^5 = 48 n ⇒ n^5 +48n -243=0.\\nCheck divisors of 243 (±1,±3,±9,±27,±81,±243):\\n n=1:1+48-243=-194≠0.\\n n=3:243+144-243=144≠0.\\n n=9:59049+432-243>0 large,\\n n=-1:-1-48-243=-292≠0,\\n n=-3:-243-144-243=-630≠0. Others even larger magnitude.\\nSimilarly m=-3: -243-n^5 = -48n ⇒ n^5 -48n +243=0.\\nTest divisors of 243:\\n n=1:1-48+243=196≠0.\\n n=3:243-144+243=342≠0.\\n n=-1:-1+48+243=290≠0.\\n n=-3:-243+144+243=144≠0.\\nNo roots.\\nFor |m|≥3 and |n|≥3, note that difference of fifth powers grows rapidly. A rigorous bound: assume |m|≥|n|≥3 and m≠±n.\\nThen |m^5 - n^5| ≥ |m^5 - (m-1)^5| = 5m^4 -10m^3 +10m^2 -5m +1.\\nFor m≥3 this exceeds 16m^2; compute at m=3: 5·81 -10·27 +10·9 -15 +1 =405 -270 +90 -15 +1=211 > 16·9=144. The difference grows like 5m^4 while 16|mn|≤16 m^2|n|≤16 m^3, so for m≥3 the left side minimal gap between neighboring fifth powers already exceeds maximal possible 16|mn| with |n|≤m. Thus no solutions with |m|≥3, |n|≥3, m≠n.\\nWe must still check cases where one of |m|,|n| is 3 or 4 and the other is smaller in magnitude, but we effectively did by fixing m in {±1,±2,±3} and scanning integer n. By symmetry, swapping m,n yields no new solutions.\\nHence all integer solutions are (0,0) and (-2,2).\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nPolynomial x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48 with positive roots p<q<r. By Viète:\\n p + q + r = a,\\n pq + pr + qr = b,\\n p q r = 48.\\nWe seek minimum of S = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r under constraints p,q,r>0, p<q<r, pqr=48.\\nExpress S using product constraint:\\n 1/p = (qr)/48,\\n 1/q = (pr)/48,\\n 1/r = (pq)/48.\\nSo\\n S = (qr)/48 + 2(pr)/48 + 3(pq)/48 = (qr + 2pr + 3pq)/48.\\nLet’s write it in symmetric sums: let s1 = p+q+r, s2 = pq+pr+qr, s3 = pqr=48.\\nCompute qr, pr, pq individually not directly from s1,s2,s3. Another approach: treat p,q,r as variables with constraint pqr=48, and use calculus/inequalities.\\nGiven p<q<r, but for minimization we can initially ignore strict ordering and impose it later; the minimum over all positive p,q,r with product 48 may occur at symmetric or boundary configurations. However coefficients in S are asymmetric (1,2,3), so minimum likely at some interior critical point where constraints hold, not fully symmetric.\\nBetter approach: use Lagrange multipliers: minimize\\n S(p,q,r) = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r subject to g(p,q,r) = ln p + ln q + ln r - ln 48 = 0 (equivalent to pqr=48).\\nSet up ∇S = λ ∇g.\\nCompute partial derivatives:\\n ∂S/∂p = -1/p^2,\\n ∂S/∂q = -2/q^2,\\n ∂S/∂r = -3/r^2.\\n∂g/∂p = 1/p, ∂g/∂q = 1/q, ∂g/∂r = 1/r.\\nSo equations:\\n -1/p^2 = λ (1/p) ⇒ -1/p^2 = λ/p ⇒ multiply by p: -1/p = λ.   (A)\\n -2/q^2 = λ (1/q) ⇒ -2/q^2 = λ/q ⇒ multiply by q: -2/q = λ.     (B)\\n -3/r^2 = λ (1/r) ⇒ -3/r^2 = λ/r ⇒ multiply by r: -3/r = λ.       (C)\\nSet these equal: from (A) and (B): -1/p = -2/q ⇒ 1/p = 2/q ⇒ q = 2p.\\nFrom (B) and (C): -2/q = -3/r ⇒ 2/q = 3/r ⇒ r = (3/2) q.\\nCombining: with q = 2p ⇒ r = (3/2)(2p) = 3p.\\nThus at interior critical point, (p,q,r) proportional to (1,2,3).\\nImpose product constraint: p·(2p)·(3p) = 48 ⇒ 6 p^3 = 48 ⇒ p^3 = 8 ⇒ p=2 (positive root). Then q=4, r=6.\\nThese are distinct and ordered 2<4<6, so they respect the conditions on roots.\\nWe must verify this critical point indeed gives a minimum of S under constraint. Since S is convex in each variable over (0,∞) (second derivatives 2/p^3, 4/q^3, 6/r^3 > 0), and the constraint surface is smooth, this stationary point is the unique constrained extremum and corresponds to minimum (no local maxima since as any variable →0^+ or →∞ under fixed product, some terms of S blow up). More concretely: if p→0, then 1/p→∞, so S→∞; if r→∞, to keep product fixed, p or q →0, again S→∞. Thus S attains a global minimum at the unique interior critical point.\\nSo minimal S is attained at (p,q,r) = (2,4,6).\\nCompute S there:\\n S_min = 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/6 = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3/2.\\nThus minimum possible value is 3/2.\\n\\nTherefore:\\nProblem 1 solutions: (m,n) = (0,0) and (m,n) = (-2,2).\\nProblem 2 minimum value: 3/2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"(0,0), (-2,2)\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
