  "math_problem": "Let $n=2000$ and $p=23$. The exponent of $p$ in $n!$ is $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\lfloor n / p^k \\rfloor$. Find the greatest positive integer $x$ such that $p^{6+x}$ divides $n!$. Instead of determining the largest additional exponent beyond 6 for which the prime power divides the factorial, simply find $m = \\lfloor n / p \\rfloor - 36$, where $\\lfloor n / p \\rfloor$ is the first term in the sum for the exponent of $p$ in $n!$. Let $S=\\{-100,-99,-98, \\ldots, 99,100\\}$. Choose a $m$-element subset $T$ of $S$ at random. Find the expected number of elements of the set $\\{|x|: x \\in T\\}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First compute m. Here n = 2000 and p = 23, so floor(n/p) = floor(2000/23). Since 23*86 = 1978 and 23*87 = 2001 > 2000, floor(2000/23) = 86. Then m = floor(n/p) - 36 = 86 - 36 = 50.\\n\\nNow consider the set S = {-100, -99, ..., -1, 0, 1, ..., 99, 100}. We choose a random m-element subset T of S, with m = 50. We want the expected number of distinct absolute values in {|x| : x in T}.\\n\\nLet A = {|x| : x in S}. Then A = {0, 1, 2, ..., 100}. For each k in A, define an indicator random variable I_k that equals 1 if k appears in {|x| : x in T}, and 0 otherwise. The expected number of distinct absolute values is E[sum_{k=0}^{100} I_k] = sum_{k=0}^{100} E[I_k] = sum_{k=0}^{100} P(I_k = 1).\\n\\nWe need P(I_k = 1), i.e., the probability that some element of T has absolute value k.\\n\\nCase 1: k = 0. Only element with |x| = 0 is 0 itself. S has 201 elements (from -100 to 100). Probability that 0 is not chosen in a random 50-element subset T is the probability that T is entirely contained in S \\\\ {0}, which has 200 elements. Thus P(I_0 = 0) = C(200, 50) / C(201, 50). Therefore P(I_0 = 1) = 1 - C(200, 50) / C(201, 50). Using C(201, 50) = 201/151 * C(200, 50)? Instead, more simply, note that in choosing T as a 50-element subset, each element of S has equal chance to be in T, so P(0 in T) = 50 / 201. Thus P(I_0 = 1) = 50/201.\\n\\nCase 2: k in {1, 2, ..., 100}. For each such k, the elements with absolute value k are the pair {k, -k}. We want the probability that at least one of k or -k belongs to T.\\n\\nProbability that neither k nor -k is chosen equals the probability that the 50-element subset T is entirely contained in S without these two elements. S \\\\ {k, -k} has 199 elements, so P(neither k nor -k in T) = C(199, 50) / C(201, 50). Hence P(I_k = 1) = 1 - C(199, 50) / C(201, 50).\\n\\nNow compute these probabilities more explicitly.\\n\\nFor k = 0: P(I_0 = 1) = 50/201.\\n\\nFor k >= 1: P(I_k = 1) = 1 - C(199, 50)/C(201, 50).\\n\\nCompute ratio C(199, 50)/C(201, 50). Using the identity C(201, 50) = (201*200)/(151*150) * C(199, 50). This comes from:\\nC(201, 50) / C(199, 50) = [201! / (50! * 151!)] / [199! / (50! * 149!)] = (201 * 200 * 199! * 50! * 149!) / (50! * 151! * 199!) = (201 * 200) / (151 * 150).\\nTherefore C(199, 50)/C(201, 50) = (151 * 150) / (201 * 200).\\n\\nThus for k >= 1:\\nP(I_k = 1) = 1 - (151 * 150) / (201 * 200).\\n\\nSimplify this:\\n151 * 150 = 22650.\\n201 * 200 = 40200.\\nSo P(I_k = 1) = 1 - 22650/40200 = (40200 - 22650)/40200 = 17550/40200.\\nSimplify fraction 17550/40200 by dividing numerator and denominator by 50: 17550/50 = 351, 40200/50 = 804. So we get 351/804. Check if reducible: gcd(351,804)? 351 = 3 * 117 = 3 * 9 * 13 = 27 * 13. 804 = 4 * 201 = 4 * 3 * 67 = 12 * 67. Common factor 3: 351/3 = 117, 804/3 = 268. So 351/804 = 117/268. 117 factors: 9*13; 268 factors: 4*67; no further common factors. So P(I_k = 1) = 117/268.\\n\\nNow P(I_0 = 1) = 50/201 (simplified fraction). We will keep as 50/201.\\n\\nExpected number of distinct absolute values:\\nE = P(I_0 = 1) + sum_{k=1}^{100} P(I_k = 1) = 50/201 + 100 * (117/268).\\n\\nNow compute this sum exactly. First, 100 * 117/268 = 11700/268. Simplify 11700/268 dividing numerator and denominator by 4: 11700/4 = 2925, 268/4 = 67. So this is 2925/67.\\n\\nSo E = 50/201 + 2925/67.\\nFind common denominator: lcm of 201 and 67. Since 201 = 3 * 67, lcm = 201. Express 2925/67 with denominator 201: multiply numerator and denominator by 3 to get 8775/201.\\nThus E = 50/201 + 8775/201 = 8825/201.\\n\\nWe can check if 8825/201 simplifies. 8825 factors: 8825 = 25 * 353 (because 353 * 25 = 8825). 201 = 3 * 67. There is no common factor, so the fraction is in lowest terms.\\n\\nTherefore, the expected number of distinct absolute values in {|x| : x in T} for m = 50 is 8825/201.\",\n    \"answer\": \"8825/201\"\n}",
