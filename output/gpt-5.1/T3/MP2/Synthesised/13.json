  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be square with 4 digits, such that all its digits are less than 6. If we add 1 to each digit the resulting number is another square. Find $n$ Instead of identifying the 4-digit perfect square satisfying the digit increment condition, simply find $m = a - 42$, where $a$ is the integer whose square is that number. P is a polynomial. When P is divided by $x-1$, the remainder is -4 . When P is divided by $x-2$, the remainder is -1 . When $P$ is divided by $x-3$, the remainder is 4 . Determine the remainder when $P$ is divided by $x^{m}-6 x^{2}+11 x-6$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First part: Find the 4-digit square n whose digits are all < 6, and when 1 is added to each digit, the new number is also a perfect square. Let n = a^2 and the new number be b^2. Adding 1 to each digit increases the number by a sum of powers of 10: n' = n + 1111. So we need a^2 and b^2 such that b^2 - a^2 = 1111 and both are 4-digit numbers with the digit condition. Use b^2 - a^2 = (b - a)(b + a) = 1111. Factor 1111: 1111 = 101 * 11. Both 101 and 11 are odd, so possible (b - a, b + a) pairs are (1, 1111), (11, 101), (101, 11), (1111, 1). Since b + a > b - a, we use (11, 101) or (1, 1111). Case 1: b - a = 11, b + a = 101. Then 2b = 112 => b = 56, 2a = 90 => a = 45. Then n = a^2 = 2025. Check digits: all ≤ 5, so < 6. Add 1 to each digit: 3136 = 56^2, a perfect square. So n = 2025, a = 45. The other pair (1, 1111) gives a non-integer, so discard. We are told to compute m = a - 42, so m = 45 - 42 = 3. Second part: P(x) is a polynomial with P(1) = -4, P(2) = -1, P(3) = 4. We must find the remainder when P is divided by x^m - 6x^2 + 11x - 6, with m = 3. Substitute: divisor is x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6. Factor this cubic: test small integer roots. f(1) = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0, so (x - 1) is a factor. Divide x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 by (x - 1) to get x^2 - 5x + 6. Factor: x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3). So x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3). When P is divided by this cubic, the remainder R(x) has degree ≤ 2, so R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. Because P(1), P(2), P(3) equal the same values as R(1), R(2), R(3), we have: R(1) = a + b + c = -4; R(2) = 4a + 2b + c = -1; R(3) = 9a + 3b + c = 4. Subtract equations to solve. From R(2) - R(1): (4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = -1 - (-4) => 3a + b = 3. From R(3) - R(2): (9a + 3b + c) - (4a + 2b + c) = 4 - (-1) => 5a + b = 5. Subtract these: (5a + b) - (3a + b) = 5 - 3 => 2a = 2 => a = 1. Then 3a + b = 3 => 3(1) + b = 3 => b = 0. Then a + b + c = -4 => 1 + 0 + c = -4 => c = -5. So R(x) = x^2 - 5. That is the remainder when P(x) is divided by x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6.\",\n    \"answer\": \"x^2-5\"\n}",
