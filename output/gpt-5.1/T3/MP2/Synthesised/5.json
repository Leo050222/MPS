  "math_problem": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $N$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen. James writes down three integers. Alex picks some two of those integers, takes the average of them, and adds the result to the third integer. If the possible final results Alex could get are $(N - 86)$, 13, and 37, what are the three integers James originally chose?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"There are 8 antigens and 256 students, each corresponding to a distinct subset of the 8-antigen set. The number of distinct subsets is 2^8 = 256, so indeed each subset is represented exactly once. For a fixed antigen, in the 2^8 subsets, that antigen is present in exactly half of them (since for that antigen, in forming all subsets, there are two choices: included or not included, and all combinations are equally represented). Therefore, N = 2^7 = 128.\\n\\nNow for the second part: James writes down three integers a, b, c. Alex chooses two, averages them, and adds to the third. The three possible final results are N - 86, 13, and 37. Since N = 128, N - 86 = 42. So the three possible final results are 42, 13, 37.\\n\\nThe possible operations are:\\n1) (a + b)/2 + c = (a + b + 2c)/2\\n2) (a + c)/2 + b = (a + c + 2b)/2\\n3) (b + c)/2 + a = (b + c + 2a)/2\\nLet these results be R1, R2, R3, which are {42, 13, 37} in some order.\\n\\nMultiply each equation by 2:\\n(1) a + b + 2c = 2R1\\n(2) a + c + 2b = 2R2\\n(3) b + c + 2a = 2R3\\n\\nAdd all three:\\n(a + b + 2c) + (a + c + 2b) + (b + c + 2a) = 2R1 + 2R2 + 2R3\\nLeft side simplifies: (a+a+2a) + (b+2b+b) + (2c+c+c) = 4a + 4b + 4c = 4(a + b + c).\\nRight side: 2(R1 + R2 + R3).\\nThus: 4(a + b + c) = 2(R1 + R2 + R3) -> a + b + c = (R1 + R2 + R3)/2.\\nSince R1 + R2 + R3 = 42 + 13 + 37 = 92, we get a + b + c = 92/2 = 46.\\n\\nNow, from (1): a + b + 2c = 2R1. But a + b = 46 - c, so 46 - c + 2c = 46 + c = 2R1 => c = 2R1 - 46.\\nSimilarly from (2): a + c + 2b = 46 + b = 2R2 => b = 2R2 - 46.\\nFrom (3): b + c + 2a = 46 + a = 2R3 => a = 2R3 - 46.\\n\\nNow we must assign which of 42, 13, 37 is R1, R2, R3. But any permutation yields a valid triple (a, b, c); it only changes the labels. One natural ordering is R1 = 42, R2 = 13, R3 = 37.\\nThen:\\nc = 2*42 - 46 = 84 - 46 = 38.\\nb = 2*13 - 46 = 26 - 46 = -20.\\na = 2*37 - 46 = 74 - 46 = 28.\\nCheck the three possible results:\\n- Using a and b, then adding c: (a + b)/2 + c = (28 - 20)/2 + 38 = 8/2 + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42.\\n- Using a and c, then adding b: (a + c)/2 + b = (28 + 38)/2 - 20 = 66/2 - 20 = 33 - 20 = 13.\\n- Using b and c, then adding a: (b + c)/2 + a = (-20 + 38)/2 + 28 = 18/2 + 28 = 9 + 28 = 37.\\nThese match the given possible results 42, 13, and 37.\\n\\nTherefore, James’s original three integers can be 28, -20, and 38.\",\n    \"answer\": \"28, -20, 38\"\n}",
