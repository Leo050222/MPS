  "math_problem": "A point $(x, y)$ is selected uniformly at random from the unit square $S=\\{(x, y) \\mid 0 \\leq x \\leq 1,0 \\leq y \\leq 1\\}$. If the probability that $(3x+2y, x+4y)$ is in $S$ is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a+b$. Instead of computing the numerical identifier from the fractional probability that the transformed point remains within the unit square, simply find $k=$ area$(R) + 1553/120$, where area$(R)$ is the measure of the subset of the unit square on which both components of the linear transformation are at most 1. In bridge, a standard 52-card deck is dealt in the usual way to 4 players. By convention, each hand is assigned a number of \"points\" based on the formula $$4 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~A} \\text {'s })+3 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~K} \\text {'s })+2 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{Q} \\text {'s })+1 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~J} \\text {'s })$$ Given that a particular hand has exactly 4 cards that are A, K, Q, or J, find the probability that its point value is $k$ or higher.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n  \"reasoning\": \"We pick (x,y) uniformly from the unit square S=[0,1]×[0,1]. The transformed point is (3x+2y, x+4y). We only care about the subset R of S where both components are ≤1:\\n\\n(1) 3x+2y ≤ 1\\n(2) x+4y ≤ 1\\nwith 0 ≤ x,y ≤ 1.\\n\\nFind the feasible region R. Solve the intersection of the lines 3x+2y=1 and x+4y=1:\\nFrom the second, x=1-4y. Substitute into the first:\\n3(1-4y)+2y = 1 ⇒ 3 -12y +2y = 1 ⇒ 3 -10y =1 ⇒ 10y=2 ⇒ y=1/5, then x=1-4/5=1/5. So the lines intersect at (1/5,1/5).\\n\\nIntercepts on axes:\\nFor 3x+2y=1:\\n- y=0 ⇒ x=1/3\\n- x=0 ⇒ y=1/2\\nFor x+4y=1:\\n- y=0 ⇒ x=1\\n- x=0 ⇒ y=1/4\\n\\nThe region R within the unit square and satisfying both inequalities is the quadrilateral with vertices (0,0), (1/3,0), (1/5,1/5), (0,1/4). The edge along the x-axis is limited by 3x≤1→x≤1/3. On the y-axis, y≤1/4 from x+4y≤1. For 0≤x≤1/5, the tighter upper bound is y≤(1-3x)/2 (since (1-x)/4 is larger there); for 1/5≤x≤1/3, the tighter is y≤(1-x)/4 (since (1-3x)/2 becomes smaller.\\n\\nCompute area(R) by splitting:\\nArea=∫[0→1/5](1-3x)/2 dx + ∫[1/5→1/3](1-x)/4 dx.\\nFirst integral:\\nI1 = (1/2)∫(1-3x)dx from 0 to 1/5 = (1/2)[x - (3/2)x^2]_0^{1/5}\\nAt x=1/5: x=1/5, x^2=1/25 ⇒ x - (3/2)x^2 = 1/5 - (3/2)(1/25)=1/5 - 3/50 = 10/50 -3/50=7/50.\\nSo I1=(1/2)*(7/50)=7/100.\\nSecond integral:\\nI2 = (1/4)∫(1-x)dx from 1/5 to 1/3 = (1/4)[x - x^2/2]_{1/5}^{1/3}.\\nEvaluate at 1/3: 1/3 - 1/18=5/18.\\nAt 1/5: 1/5 - 1/50=10/50 -1/50=9/50.\\nDifference: 5/18 - 9/50 = (5*50 - 9*18)/900 = (250 -162)/900 = 88/900=22/225.\\nThen I2=(1/4)*(22/225)=22/900=11/450.\\nSo area(R)=7/100 + 11/450. Common denominator 900: 7/100=63/900, 11/450=22/900, sum=85/900=17/180.\\n\\nThe problem defines k = area(R) + 1553/120. So\\nk = 17/180 + 1553/120.\\nFind common denominator: lcm(180,120)=360.\\n17/180 = (17*2)/360=34/360.\\n1553/120 = (1553*3)/360=4659/360.\\nSo k=(34+4659)/360=4693/360.\\n\\nNow consider the bridge problem. A 52-card deck has 16 honors (A,K,Q,J: 4 ranks × 4 suits) and 36 non-honors. A hand has 13 cards. We are told the hand has exactly 4 honors among its 13 cards. So the count of honors is fixed at 4, and the other 9 cards are non-honors. The honor cards can be of four types: A,K,Q,J with point values 4,3,2,1 respectively. Let a,k,q,j be the counts of A,K,Q,J in the hand; a+k+q+j=4. The point value of the hand (only honors contribute) is\\nP = 4a + 3k + 2q + j.\\n\\nWe must find the probability that P ≥ k, where k=4693/360≈13.036..., given there are exactly 4 honors. So P must be at least 14 (since it is an integer). The maximum possible points with 4 honors is 4*4=16 (four aces). We enumerate all integer tuples (a,k,q,j) with a+k+q+j=4 and 4a+3k+2q+j≥14.\\n\\nTotal points with 4 honors is 4a+3k+2q+j = (a+k+q+j)+3a+2k+q = 4+3a+2k+q ⇒ P=4+3a+2k+q.\\nWe require 4+3a+2k+q≥14 ⇒ 3a+2k+q≥10.\\nAlso j=4-(a+k+q)≥0.\\nWe search possibilities with nonnegative integers a,k,q,j.\\n\\nStart with high a.\\nCase a=4: then k=q=j=0. Points=16≥14; valid.\\nCase a=3: Then we have 3a=9, so need 9+2k+q≥10 ⇒2k+q≥1. Also k+q+j=1.\\nPossible (k,q,j): (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1).\\nCheck each:\\n- (1,0,0): 2*1+0=2≥1; P=4+9+2+0=15≥14; valid.\\n- (0,1,0): 0+1=1≥1; P=4+9+0+1=14; valid.\\n- (0,0,1): 0+0=0<1; P=13; invalid.\\nSo valid: (a,k,q,j)=(3,1,0,0) and (3,0,1,0).\\n\\nCase a=2: Then 3a=6; need 6+2k+q≥10 ⇒2k+q≥4. Also k+q+j=2.\\nList (k,q,j) with sum 2: (2,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,2,0),(0,1,1),(0,0,2).\\nCompute 2k+q:\\n- (2,0,0): 2*2+0=4≥4; P=4+6+4+0=14; valid.\\n- (1,1,0): 2*1+1=3<4; P=4+6+2+1=13; invalid.\\n- (1,0,1): 2*1+0=2<4; P=12; invalid.\\n- (0,2,0): 0+2=2<4; P=12; invalid.\\n- (0,1,1): 0+1=1<4; P=11; invalid.\\n- (0,0,2): 0+0=0<4; P=10; invalid.\\nSo only (a,k,q,j)=(2,2,0,0) valid.\\n\\nCase a=1: Then 3a=3; need 3+2k+q≥10 ⇒2k+q≥7. Also k+q+j=3.\\nTriples (k,q,j) with sum 3: (3,0,0),(2,1,0),(2,0,1),(1,2,0),(1,1,1),(1,0,2),(0,3,0),(0,2,1),(0,1,2),(0,0,3).\\nCheck 2k+q:\\n(3,0,0):6+0=6<7; invalid.\\n(2,1,0):4+1=5<7; invalid.\\n(2,0,1):4+0=4<7; invalid.\\n(1,2,0):2+2=4<7; invalid.\\n(1,1,1):2+1=3<7; invalid.\\n(1,0,2):2+0=2<7; invalid.\\n(0,3,0):0+3=3<7; invalid.\\n(0,2,1):0+2=2<7; invalid.\\n(0,1,2):0+1=1<7; invalid.\\n(0,0,3):0+0=0<7; invalid.\\nSo none valid.\\n\\nCase a=0: Then 3a=0; need 2k+q≥10 with k+q+j=4.\\nQuadruples with a=0 and k+q+j=4 ⇒ (k,q,j) with sum 4. Maximum 2k+q occurs when k=4,q=0: 8<10; any other has smaller 2k+q. So no valid.\\n\\nThus the only point distributions with total points ≥14 are:\\n1) (a,k,q,j)=(4,0,0,0) → point 16\\n2) (3,1,0,0) → point 15\\n3) (3,0,1,0) → point 14\\n4) (2,2,0,0) → point 14\\n\\nNow we need probabilities under the constraint “exactly 4 honors in the 13-card hand”. There are 16 honors and 36 non-honors.\\nTotal number of hands with exactly 4 honors:\\nN_total = C(16,4)*C(36,9).\\nThe 36 non-honors are indistinguishable for point counting; their only role is to confirm the count of 9 non-honors chosen.\\n\\nFor each pattern (a,k,q,j), count the number of ways to choose the honors consistent with that count. Each rank has 4 cards (suits). So:\\n- Choose a aces from 4, k kings from 4, q queens from 4, j jacks from 4, with a+k+q+j=4.\\nFor fixed (a,k,q,j), the number of honor selections is C(4,a)*C(4,k)*C(4,q)*C(4,j). Then for each such honor selection we choose 9 non-honors from 36: factor C(36,9) which will cancel in the conditional probability.\\n\\nCompute honor-ways for each valid pattern:\\n(4,0,0,0): C(4,4)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)=1.\\n(3,1,0,0): C(4,3)*C(4,1)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)=4*4=16.\\n(3,0,1,0): C(4,3)*C(4,0)*C(4,1)*C(4,0)=4*4=16.\\n(2,2,0,0): C(4,2)*C(4,2)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)=6*6=36.\\nTotal favorable honor patterns = 1+16+16+36=69.\\n\\nTotal honor patterns with exactly 4 honors regardless of points: choose any 4 of the 16 honor cards: C(16,4).\\nWe can also compute this by summing over all nonnegative quadruples (a,k,q,j) with sum 4 of C(4,a)C(4,k)C(4,q)C(4,j); that sum equals C(16,4) by multinomial interpretation. So conditional probability that a randomly chosen 13-card hand with exactly 4 honors has point value ≥k (i.e., ≥14) is:\\nP = 69 / C(16,4).\\n\\nCompute C(16,4):\\nC(16,4) = (16*15*14*13)/(4*3*2*1) = (16*15*14*13)/24.\\nCompute numerator:16*15=240; 14*13=182; 240*182=240*(200-18)=48000-4320=43680. Then divide by 24:\\n43680/24 = 1820.\\nSo C(16,4)=1820.\\nThus P=69/1820.\\nCheck for simplification: 1820 factors: 1820=182*10=2*91*10? More systematically: 1820=182*10=2*7*13*10=2*7*13*2*5=2^2*5*7*13. 69=3*23. No common factors. So fraction is reduced.\\n\\nTherefore the desired probability is 69/1820.\",\n  \"answer\": \"69/1820\"\n}",
