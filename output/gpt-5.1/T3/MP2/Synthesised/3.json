  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Let P(x)=∑ a_i x^i, with 0≤a_i≤99 integers. Write P(10)=331633 and P(−10)=273373 in base 10, with coefficients as digits: P(10)=3·10^5+3·10^4+1·10^3+6·10^2+3·10+3, P(−10)=2·10^5+7·10^4+3·10^3+3·10^2+7·10+3. For |x|=10, if all coefficients are <10 and there are no carries, then a_i are just the digits. But we must also fit P(−10). In general, with base 10 and no carries, the coefficient of x^i is determined by combining P(10) and P(−10): write P(x)=∑ a_i x^i, then P(10)=∑ a_i 10^i, P(−10)=∑ a_i (−10)^i. For each i, define d_i and e_i as the base-10 digits at 10^i in P(10) and P(−10). Then: for even i, a_i=(d_i+e_i)/2; for odd i, a_i=(d_i−e_i)/2, assuming no carries and each a_i<10. Read off digits (from units upward): P(10) digits: index 0..5 are 3,3,6,1,3,3 (i.e., 331633); P(−10) digits: 3,7,3,3,7,2 (i.e., 273373). Compute coefficients a_i:\\n i=0 (even): a_0=(3+3)/2=3; i=1 (odd): a_1=(3−7)/2=−2 (invalid if taken naively). This shows there must be carries in decimal representation, so direct digit-pair method fails. Instead, treat coefficients as possibly up to 99 and solve via parity: let P(x)=∑ a_i x^i. Then P(10)=331633, P(−10)=273373. Compute S_even=∑ a_{2j}10^{2j}, S_odd=∑ a_{2j+1}10^{2j+1}. Then P(10)=S_even+S_odd, P(−10)=S_even−S_odd. So S_even=(P(10)+P(−10))/2, S_odd=(P(10)−P(−10))/2. Compute: P(10)+P(−10)=331633+273373=605006; hence S_even=302503. Also P(10)−P(−10)=331633−273373=58260; hence S_odd=29130. Now express these in powers of 10 with coefficients restricted by 0≤a_i≤99. Even part: S_even=302503. Write as a_0·10^0 + a_2·10^2 + a_4·10^4 + a_6·10^6+… with each a_{2j}≤99 and integer. Since 302503<10^6, highest even index is 4. Let S_even=a_0 + a_2·100 + a_4·10000. Similarly S_odd=29130=a_1·10 + a_3·1000 + a_5·100000, but 29130<10^5 so a_5=0. Thus:\\n (1) a_0 + 100 a_2 + 10000 a_4 = 302503\\n (2) 10 a_1 + 1000 a_3 = 29130\\n with 0≤a_i≤99 integers.\\n Solve (2): divide by 10: a_1 + 100 a_3 = 2913. Since a_3≤29 (else 100 a_3≥3000), try a_3 from 0 up. Then a_1=2913−100 a_3. Need 0≤a_1≤99. So 0≤2913−100 a_3≤99 ⇒ 100 a_3≤2913 and 100 a_3≥2814 ⇒ 28.14≤a_3≤29.13, so a_3 is 29. Then a_1=2913−2900=13. Both ≤99, valid. Thus a_3=29.\\n So k=a_3−27=29−27=2.\\n Next, consider a primitive integer right triangle with legs m,n and hypotenuse h, relatively prime sides (so it is a primitive Pythagorean triple). Let the legs be a,b and hypotenuse c. For primitive triples we can use parameterization: a=m^2−n^2, b=2mn, c=m^2+n^2 with m>n>0, gcd(m,n)=1, opposite parity. Then perimeter P=a+b+c=2m^2+2mn and area A=ab/2=(m^2−n^2)mn. We need to maximize P^k/A with k=2. So maximize P^2/A=(a+b+c)^2 / (ab/2)=2(a+b+c)^2/(ab). Using a,b legs directly is simpler: given primitive triple (a,b,c) with gcd(a,b,c)=1 and c^2=a^2+b^2, P=a+b+c, A=ab/2. Then T= P^2/A =2P^2/(ab). Since we want the largest possible integer value, and triples are infinite, we must see if T grows without bound or has a max. Use m,n form. Compute:\\n P=2m^2+2mn=2m(m+n). Also a=m^2−n^2, b=2mn ⇒ ab=2mn(m^2−n^2)=2mn(m−n)(m+n). Then\\n T=2P^2/(ab)=2[2m(m+n)]^2 / [2mn(m−n)(m+n)] =2·4m^2(m+n)^2 / [2mn(m−n)(m+n)] = (8m^2(m+n)^2)/(2mn(m−n)(m+n)) = (4m(m+n))/(n(m−n)).\\n So T=4m(m+n)/[n(m−n)], with integers m>n>0, gcd(m,n)=1, m−n odd. Need T integral and as large as possible. Write T = 4m(m+n)/(n(m−n)). Consider growth: for fixed ratio r=m/n>1, asymptotically m≈rn, T≈ 4rn(rn+n)/(n(rn−n))=4r(r+1)/(r−1), bounded in r. That expression increases as r increases and tends to 8 as r→∞. For r→1^+, T→∞. So the largest occurs near m≈n, i.e., m=n+1. So set m=n+1. Then gcd(n+1,n)=1 always, and m−n=1 (odd). So all such pairs are primitive. Plug into T:\\n T=4m(m+n)/[n(m−n)] with m=n+1 ⇒ m+n=(2n+1), m−n=1, so\\n T=4(n+1)(2n+1)/n.\\n We need n such that T is integer: 4(n+1)(2n+1) must be divisible by n. Since gcd(n, n+1)=1 and gcd(n, 2n+1)=gcd(n,1)=1, gcd(n, (n+1)(2n+1))=1. Therefore n must divide 4 for T integer. So n∈{1,2,4}. Compute: n=1 → m=2, triple (3,4,5). Then T=4·2·3/(1·1)=24. n=2 → m=3: T=4·3·5/(2·1)=60/2=30. n=4 → m=5: T=4·5·9/(4·1)=180/4=45. So among m=n+1 pairs, max T is 45 (at n=4,m=5 ⇒ 9-40-41 triple).\\n But we must also consider m>n+1. However, earlier bound T≈4r(r+1)/(r−1). For m>n+1, r≥1+1/n. The worst case for large T is smallest r, i.e., r close to 1. For given n, r_min=(n+1)/n yields the largest T for that n. For larger m, r increases, and for real r the function 4r(r+1)/(r−1) decreases for r>1 until some point then increases? Check derivative: f(r)=4(r^2+r)/(r−1)=4[(r^2+r)/(r−1)]. Long division: r^2+r=(r−1)r+2r ⇒ f(r)=4[r+2r/(r−1)]. Derivative: f'(r)=4[1+2·((r−1)−1)/(r−1)^2]=4[1+2(r−2)/(r−1)^2]. For r>1, (r−2) can be negative for r<2, so behavior changes. But we do not need exact calculus; better to work discretely: for fixed n, T as function of integer m>n is T=4m(m+n)/[n(m−n)]. For fixed n, consider m=n+k, k≥1. Then T=4(n+k)(2n+k)/[n k]. For k fixed, as n grows, T≈4(2n^2)/(n k)=8n/k→∞, but we must respect primitive and parity conditions and integrality. However, T need not be integral for all, and we require primitive triple (gcd(m,n)=1, m−n odd).\\n Instead of bounding by continuous r, check the integrality condition: T integral ⇔ n(m−n) | 4m(m+n). Let d=n(m−n). Because gcd(n,m)=1, gcd(n, m+n)=gcd(n, n)=n; that does not help directly, so we do a more number-theoretic analysis. But note that we already found infinite families with T integer? For m=n+1, integrality forces n|4, so finite. For other k, integrality may impose bounds leading to finite many solutions. Let's search structurally: write m and n coprime, opposite parity. Let g=gcd(n, m+n). Then g=gcd(n,m). since m≡−n mod (m+n), so gcd(n,m+n)=gcd(n,m). But gcd(m,n)=1, so g=1. Hence n and m+n are coprime. Similarly, gcd(m−n,m)=gcd(m−n,n), but since gcd(m,n)=1, gcd(m−n,n)=1 as well. Also gcd(m−n,m+n)=gcd(m−n,2n)=1 or 2. Using these, factor numerator and denominator: numerator N=4m(m+n), denominator D=n(m−n). Because gcd(m+n,n)=1 and gcd(m,m−n)=1, D must divide 4·(m+n)·n? But more precisely, since gcd(m, n)=1, gcd(m, n(m−n))=1; so any prime factor of D that divides m must come from gcd(m, m−n) which is 1. Thus gcd(m,D)=1. Therefore D | 4(m+n). So n(m−n) divides 4(m+n). This is crucial. Derivation: T = 4m(m+n)/[n(m−n)]. Since gcd(m, n(m−n))=1, denominator divides 4(m+n). Correct. So n(m−n) ≤ 4(m+n). This inequality bounds possibilities.\\n Let x=n, y=m−n>0. Then gcd(m,n)=1 implies gcd(x,y)=1 (since m=x+y). Also x,y opposite parity because m,n opposite parity ⇒ (x+y) and x opposite parity ⇒ y same parity as m−n so odd. Actually if m,n have opposite parity, then y=m−n is odd. So y is odd, x can be any positive integer coprime to y. Inequality: x y ≤ 4(x+y). We seek integer pairs x,y≥1, gcd(x,y)=1, y odd, and also n<m ⇒ y≥1. From xy ≤4(x+y), we derive finite solutions.\\n Rewrite xy −4x−4y ≤0 ⇒ (x−4)(y−4) ≤16. Indeed xy−4x−4y+16 ≤16 ⇒ (x−4)(y−4) ≤16. Now x,y positive integers with y odd and gcd(x,y)=1. There are finitely many pairs. We also must check D|4(m+n)=4(x+ x+y)=4(2x+y). Equivalently, xy | 4(2x+y). This will further restrict pairs. But we can just brute-force logically: from (x−4)(y−4) ≤16 and x≥1,y≥1. Try small y. Because y odd and at least 1.\\n Case y=1: inequality x·1 ≤4(x+1) ⇒ x ≤4x+4 ⇒ true for all x≥1. Also (x−4)(−3) ≤16 ⇒ always if x≥1. Next, T in terms of x,y? Recall T=4m(m+n)/[n(m−n)]=4(x+y)(2x+y)/[x y]. Substitute. For y=1: T=4(x+1)(2x+1)/(x·1)=4(2x^2+3x+1)/x=8x+12+4/x. For T integer, 4/x must be integer so x|4: x∈{1,2,4}. Values: x=1→T=8+12+4=24; x=2→T=16+12+2=30; x=4→T=32+12+1=45. These correspond to n=1,2,4 with m=n+1 as found.\\n Check inequality for y≥3: because (x−4)(y−4) ≤16 and y≥3 odd ⇒ y=3,5,7,…\\n - y=3: inequality: 3x ≤4(x+3) ⇒3x ≤4x+12 ⇒ x≥−12, always true for x≥1. Also (x−4)(−1) ≤16 always as long as x≥1. T=4(x+3)(2x+3)/(3x). Compute T integer condition: T= [4(2x^2+9x+9)]/(3x)= (8x+36+36/x)/3= (8x)/3 +12+12/x. For integer T, both 8x/3 and 12/x must combine to an integer. Let’s write T explicitly: T=(8x^2+36x+36)/(3x). For T integer, 3x | 8x^2+36x+36. Reduce mod x: need 3x |36 ⇒ 3x ≤36 ⇒ x≤12. Also, since T must be positive, fine. Enumerate x=1..12 with gcd(x,3)=1? No, we only need gcd(x,y)=1: y=3, so gcd(x,3)=1 ⇒ x≠3,6,9,12. For each, check divisibility. Compute numerator N=8x^2+36x+36. For x=1: N=8+36+36=80, D=3→80/3 not integer. x=2: N=32+72+36=140, D=6→140/6 not int. x=4: N=128+144+36=308, D=12→308/12 not int. x=5: N=200+180+36=416, D=15→416/15 not int. x=7: N=392+252+36=680, D=21→680/21 not int. x=8: N=512+288+36=836, D=24→836/24 not int. x=10: N=800+360+36=1196, D=30→1196/30 not int. x=11: N=968+396+36=1400, D=33→1400/33 not int. So no new integer T for y=3.\\n - y=5: inequality: 5x ≤4(x+5) ⇒5x ≤4x+20 ⇒ x≤20. Also (x−4)(1) ≤16 ⇒ x−4≤16 ⇒ x≤20, consistent. T=4(x+5)(2x+5)/(5x)=4(2x^2+15x+25)/(5x)=(8x^2+60x+100)/(5x). Need 5x | 8x^2+60x+100. Mod x: require 5x |100 ⇒5x ≤100 ⇒ x≤20 (already). Also gcd(x,5)=1 since gcd(x, y=5)=1 ⇒ x≠5,10,15,20. Check x in {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14,16,17,18,19}. For each, see if numerator divisible by 5x. Since we know 5x | 100, actually 5x must divide 100. For x>20 impossible, for x in set, 5x∈{5,10,15,20,30,35,40,45,55,60,65,70,80,85,90,95}. Only those dividing 100 are 5,10,20,25,50,100. From list: 5,10,20,50,100 correspond to x=1,2,4,10,20. But x≠10,20, and x=1,2,4 allowed. We must still verify full divisibility. For x=1: N=8+60+100=168, D=5→168/5 not int. x=2: N=32+120+100=252, D=10→252/10 not int. x=4: N=128+240+100=468, D=20→468/20 not int. So no solution y=5.\\n Because xy ≤4(x+y) and symmetry in x,y (apart from parity/gcd), as y grows larger, x is bounded too. We could in principle scan remaining odd y: y=7,9,11,... but the inequality gets tighter. Observe that for y≥7, (x−4)(y−4)≤16 ⇒ x−4 ≤16/(y−4). When y=7, RHS=16/3<6 so x≤10; y=9→16/5<4 so x≤8; y=11→16/7<3 so x≤7; y=13→16/9<2 so x≤6; y=15→16/11<2 so x≤6; for larger y, x≤5. So the search is finite and small. For each y≥7, we check possible x with gcd(x,y)=1 and integrality condition xy | 4(2x+y). But we can shortcut using the divisor argument: since gcd(x,y)=1, we have xy divides 4(2x+y) ⇒ y divides 4(2x+y). Mod y, 2x+y≡2x, so y | 8x. Since gcd(x,y)=1, y |8. So y∈{1,2,4,8}, but y is odd, so y∈{1}. Thus the only possible y is 1. This is much simpler and retroactively covers all cases, including y=3,5 which we tested directly and found no integrality; the theorem says they can’t satisfy divisibility, consistent with computations (we implicitly used the stronger condition D|4(m+n), which already narrowed choices). Therefore the only possible y=m−n that yields integer T is y=1. Then n divides 4 as shown earlier, giving n∈{1,2,4}, and corresponding T values 24,30,45. Hence the largest possible integral value of P^k/A is 45.\\n Therefore the requested final answer is 45.\",\n    \"answer\": \"45\"\n}",
