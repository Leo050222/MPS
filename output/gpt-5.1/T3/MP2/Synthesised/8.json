  "math_problem": "Find two lines of symmetry of the graph of the function $y=x+\\frac{1}{x}$. Express your answer as two equations of the form $y=a x+b$. Instead of determining the equations of the lines of symmetry, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote parallel to the y-axis, derived from the asymptotic analysis of the curve. Determine all triplets of real numbers $(x, y, z)$ satisfying the system of equations $x^{2} y+y^{2} z =k+1039$, $x^{2} z+z^{2} y =260$, $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) =-540$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given f(x) = x + 1/x. Its graph has no vertical asymptote; both asymptotes are oblique: y = x and y = -x. Thus there is no asymptote parallel to the y-axis, so its equation cannot be written in the form y = ax + b with a finite coefficient vector (a, b). The notion of the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector of a vertical asymptote is ill-defined here, so k is undefined. Since k is not well-defined, the shifted constant k + 1039 in the first equation of the system is also not well-defined, and the system cannot be solved in a mathematically consistent way. Therefore there is no determinate triplet (x, y, z) we can obtain from the given instructions.\",\n    \"answer\": \"no solution\"\n}",
