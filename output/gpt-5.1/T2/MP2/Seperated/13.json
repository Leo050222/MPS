  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let width be w and length be 3w. Perimeter is 2(l + w) = 2(3w + w) = 8w. Area is l·w = 3w². Given perimeter and area are numerically equal to k, we have 8w = k and 3w² = k. Set them equal: 8w = 3w². Since k > 0, w > 0, so divide by w: 8 = 3w, hence w = 8/3. Then k = 8w = 8·(8/3) = 64/3. (Check: area = 3w² = 3·(64/9) = 64/3, consistent.) So k = 64/3.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let the length of the ladder be L. Initially, distance from house is 15 ft, so the vertical height is h₁ = sqrt(L² − 15²). After pulling the bottom 9 ft farther, the distance from the house is 24 ft, and the height becomes h₂ = sqrt(L² − 24²). The top slides 13 ft down, so h₁ − h₂ = 13. Set up equation: sqrt(L² − 15²) − sqrt(L² − 24²) = 13. Simplify squares: sqrt(L² − 225) − sqrt(L² − 576) = 13. Let A = sqrt(L² − 225), B = sqrt(L² − 576). Then A − B = 13 and A² − B² = (L² − 225) − (L² − 576) = 351. Also A² − B² = (A − B)(A + B) = 13(A + B). Thus 13(A + B) = 351 ⇒ A + B = 351/13. Solve system: A − B = 13, A + B = 351/13. Add: 2A = 13 + 351/13 = (169 + 351)/13 = 520/13, so A = 260/13 = 20. Then A² = L² − 225 = 400 ⇒ L² = 625 ⇒ L = 25 (positive length).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"64/3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"25\"\n}",
