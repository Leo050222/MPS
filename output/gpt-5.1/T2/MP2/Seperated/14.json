  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Donuts come in dozens (12). Victoria needs at least 550 donuts. Compute the minimum number of dozens: 550 ÷ 12 ≈ 45.83..., so we need 46 dozens. Each dozen costs 7.49 dollars. Total cost = 46 × 7.49. Compute: 7.49 × 40 = 299.60, and 7.49 × 6 = 44.94. Sum = 299.60 + 44.94 = 344.54. So Victoria must pay 344.54 dollars.\\n\\nProblem 2: We want primes p such that 5p = ⌊n²/5⌋ for some positive integer n. Let n = 5k + r, where r ∈ {0,1,2,3,4}. Then n² = 25k² + 10kr + r², so\\n\\nn²/5 = 5k² + 2kr + r²/5, and ⌊n²/5⌋ = 5k² + 2kr + ⌊r²/5⌋.\\nWe need 5p = 5k² + 2kr + ⌊r²/5⌋, so p = k² + (2kr)/5 + ⌊r²/5⌋/5.\\nFor p to be an integer, 5 must divide 2kr + ⌊r²/5⌋·(mod 5 condition). An easier route is to analyze n² modulo 5: n² mod 5 can be 0,1,4. Write n² = 5m + s with s ∈ {0,1,4}. Then ⌊n²/5⌋ = m when s ∈ {0,1,4}. We require m = 5p, hence n² = 5(5p) + s = 25p + s, with s ∈ {0,1,4}. So n² ≡ s (mod 25), and n² = 25p + s ⇒ p = (n² - s)/25 must be prime.\\nNow consider n modulo 25 and compute n² mod 25. We need values congruent to s ∈ {0,1,4}. Also we need (n² - s)/25 prime and positive. Enumerate residues:\\nSquares mod 25 for n = 0..24 are: 0²=0, 1²=1, 2²=4, 3²=9, 4²=16, 5²=0, 6²=11, 7²=24, 8²=14, 9²=6, 10²=0, 11²=21, 12²=19, 13²=19, 14²=21, 15²=0, 16²=6, 17²=14, 18²=24, 19²=11, 20²=0, 21²=16, 22²=9, 23²=4, 24²=1 (all mod 25). The residues that equal 0,1,4 are possible s values, but recall s is exactly 0,1,4. So we need n² ≡ 0,1,4 (mod 25) and then set s equal to that residue.\\nCase s = 0: n² ≡ 0 mod 25. Then n multiple of 5. Let n = 5t, then n² = 25t², so 25p = n² (since s = 0) ⇒ p = t². For p prime and t positive integer, t² prime implies t = 1 and p = 1, not prime. So no solutions for s = 0.\\nCase s = 1: n² ≡ 1 mod 25. Then possible residues for n are those with square 1 mod 25: from the list, n ≡ 1,24 (or equivalently ±1). So n² = 25p + 1 ⇒ p = (n² - 1)/25. Note n² - 1 = (n-1)(n+1). For n ≡ 1 mod 25, write n = 25k + 1. Then n² - 1 = (25k + 1)² - 1 = 625k² + 50k. Factor 25: (n² - 1)/25 = 25k² + 2k = k(25k + 2). For this to be prime, k must be 1 (otherwise product of two >1). For k = 1, p = 1*(25*1 + 2) = 27, not prime. For n ≡ 24 mod 25, write n = 25k + 24. Then n² - 1 = (25k + 24)² - 1 = 625k² + 1200k + 576 - 1 = 625k² + 1200k + 575. Divide by 25: p = (n² - 1)/25 = 25k² + 48k + 23. We need this prime. Try small k.\\n- k = 0: n = 24, p = 23 (prime). Check original condition: n² = 576, n²/5 = 115.2, floor = 115 = 5*23, works.\\n- k = 1: p = 25 + 48 + 23 = 96, not prime.\\n- For k ≥ 2, 25k² + 48k + 23 grows and can be composite; however, the problem statement asserts only two prime solutions total, so we must also inspect the other s case.\\nCase s = 4: n² ≡ 4 mod 25. From the list, residues giving 4 are n ≡ 2,23 (i.e., ±2). Then n² = 25p + 4 ⇒ p = (n² - 4)/25. Also n² - 4 = (n-2)(n+2).\\nSubcase n ≡ 2 mod 25: n = 25k + 2. Then n² - 4 = (25k + 2)² - 4 = 625k² + 100k. So p = (n² - 4)/25 = 25k² + 4k = k(25k + 4). For primality, k must be 1. For k = 1: p = 1*(25+4) = 29 (prime). Then n = 27. Check: n² = 729, n²/5 = 145.8, floor = 145 = 5*29, works.\\nSubcase n ≡ 23 mod 25: n = 25k + 23. Then n² - 4 = (25k + 23)² - 4 = 625k² + 1150k + 529 - 4 = 625k² + 1150k + 525. Divide by 25: p = 25k² + 46k + 21. Try k = 0: p = 21, not prime. For k ≥ 1, expression becomes composite or at least not obviously prime, and the problem states there are exactly two such primes overall.\\nCollecting valid primes found: p = 23 (from n = 24) and p = 29 (from n = 27). These are the two primes such that 5p = floor(n²/5) for some positive integer n. Their sum is 23 + 29 = 52.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"344.54\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"52\"\n}",
