  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Instead of determining the number of partitions of the set into pairs that form a single cell, simply find $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game. What is the probability that exactly $k$ games will need to be played to determine a winner?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair, so the set A must have exactly 2 elements (since the pairs form a partition of A and there is exactly one pair). Thus n = 2 and k = n + 5 = 7. In a best-of-9 series, the first team to 5 wins takes the series. For the series to end in exactly k = 7 games, the winning team must earn its 5th win in game 7, and after 6 games the wins must be split 4–2 in favor of the ultimate winner. Let M be the Mathletes (win probability p = 2/3) and O the opponents (win probability q = 1/3). Case 1: Mathletes win the series in 7. Then after 6 games they must have 4 wins and 2 losses, and they win game 7. Probability: C(6,4) * p^4 * q^2 * p = 15 * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2. Case 2: Opponents win the series in 7. After 6 games, opponents have 4 wins and Mathletes 2, then opponents win game 7. Probability: C(6,4) * q^4 * p^2 * q = 15 * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2. Total probability is 15 * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2 + 15 * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2. Factor: 15 * (2^5/3^7 + 2^2/3^7) = 15 * (32 + 4)/3^7 = 15 * 36 / 3^7 = 540 / 2187. Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 27: (540/27) / (2187/27) = 20/81. Thus the probability that exactly k games (k = 7) are needed is 20/81.\",\n    \"answer\": \"20/81\"\n}",
