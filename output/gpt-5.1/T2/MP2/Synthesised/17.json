Instead of determining the smallest positive shift that preserves the function values modulo the prime for every input, simply find \\( d = \\operatorname{lcm}(23, 22, 10) - 2528 \\).

  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First compute d. We are told d = lcm(23,22,10) - 2528. Since 23,22,10 factor as 23, 2·11, 2·5, the LCM is 2·5·11·23 = 2530. Thus d = 2530 - 2528 = 2.\\n\\nNext, solve for positive integers a,b such that 8 a^a b^b = 27 a^b b^a.\\nRewrite by dividing both sides by a^a b^a (positive, so allowed):\\n8 b^{b-a} = 27 a^{b-a}.\\nIf a=b, then left side becomes 8, right side 27, impossible. So a ≠ b, and b-a ≠ 0.\\nLet k = b - a. Then k ≠ 0, and we have:\\n8 b^k = 27 a^k.\\nRearrange:\\n(b/a)^k = 27/8 = (3/2)^3.\\nSince a,b are positive integers, b/a is rational in lowest terms. The fraction 27/8 in lowest terms is (3^3)/(2^3). To express (3/2)^3 as (b/a)^k, the base b/a in lowest terms must be 3/2, so assume b/a = 3/2.\\nWrite a = 2m, b = 3m for some positive integer m.\\nThen b/a = 3/2, so (b/a)^k = (3/2)^k = (3/2)^3 ⇒ k = 3.\\nSo b - a = 3.\\nSubstitute a=2m, b=3m into b-a=3: 3m - 2m = 3 ⇒ m = 3.\\nHence a = 6, b = 9.\\nCheck the original equation:\\nLeft: 8·6^6·9^9; Right: 27·6^9·9^6.\\nFactor: Left/Right = (8/27)·6^{6-9}·9^{9-6} = (8/27)·6^{-3}·9^3.\\nCompute 9^3=729 and 6^3=216, so 9^3/6^3 = 729/216 = 27/8, giving (8/27)·(27/8)=1, so equality holds. Thus (a,b)=(6,9).\\nNow d = 2, so a^d + b^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 6^2 + 9^2 = 36 + 81 = 117.\\nTherefore, the final answer is 117.\",\n    \"answer\": \"117\"\n}",
