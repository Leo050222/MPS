Write n = q^k * m, where k ≥ 1 and all prime factors of m are < q.\\n\\nFirst check small n directly:\\n- n = 2: σ(2) = 1 + 2 = 3, q = 2, so σ(n)/(q − 1) = 3/1 = 3 ≠ 2.\\n- n = 3: σ(3) = 4, q = 3, 4/(3−1) = 4/2 = 2 ≠ 3.\\n- n = 4 = 2^2: σ(4) = 1+2+4=7, q=2, 7/(2−1)=7≠4.\\n- n = 5: σ(5)=6, q=5, 6/4=1.5≠5.\\n- n = 6=2·3: σ(6)=1+2+3+6=12, q=3, 12/(3−1)=6, so n=6 works.\\n- n = 7: σ(7)=8, q=7, 8/6 not integer.\\n- n = 8=2^3: σ(8)=1+2+4+8=15, q=2, 15/(2−1)=15≠8.\\n- n = 9=3^2: σ(9)=1+3+9=13, q=3, 13/2≠9.\\n- n = 10=2·5: σ(10)=1+2+5+10=18, q=5, 18/4=4.5≠10.\\n- n = 12=2^2·3: σ(12)=1+2+3+4+6+12=28, q=3, 28/2=14≠12.\\nAlready we have one solution, n=6.\\n\\nNow analyze structure.\\nLet q = p(n). Then σ(n) = σ(q^k)σ(m) = ((q^{k+1} − 1)/(q − 1))·σ(m). The equation σ(n) = n(q − 1) becomes\\n((q^{k+1} − 1)/(q − 1))·σ(m) = q^k m (q − 1).\\nEquivalently,\\nσ(m) = q^k m (q − 1)^2 / (q^{k+1} − 1).\\nSince σ(m) is an integer and gcd(q^{k+1} − 1, q) = 1, the denominator (q^{k+1} − 1) must divide m (q − 1)^2.\\nBut every prime divisor of m is < q, while any prime divisor of q^{k+1} − 1 is also < q^{k+1} and can be ≥ q or < q. However, to have q^{k+1} − 1 | m(q − 1)^2, any prime ≥ q dividing q^{k+1} − 1 must divide (q−1)^2. That forces strong constraints; particularly, for k ≥ 2, q^{k+1} − 1 is large and typically has primes not dividing q − 1, so the divisibility is impossible. One therefore expects k must be 1 (n is squarefree with respect to its largest prime factor).\\n\\nSo consider k = 1: n = q·m, where all primes of m are < q.\\nThen σ(n) = σ(q)σ(m) = (1+q)σ(m) and the equation becomes\\n(1+q)σ(m) = qm(q−1)\\n⇒ σ(m) = q m (q−1)/(q+1).\\nThus (q+1) | q m (q−1). Since gcd(q+1, q(q−1)) is small (it divides 2), we must have q+1 | 2m.\\nBecause all prime factors of m are < q, any prime factor of q+1 must be ≤ q+1, but if a prime factor r of q+1 satisfied r > q, then r cannot divide m; then it must divide 2. Thus every prime factor of q+1 greater than 2 is impossible; so q+1 can only be 2^t. Therefore q+1 is a power of 2. This implies q is a Mersenne prime of the form 2^t − 1.\\nNow q is odd ≥ 3, so q+1 is even, and gcd(q+1, q(q−1)) = 2. Hence (q+1)/2 | m.\\nWrite m = ((q+1)/2)·u. Substitute back:\\nσ(m) = σ((q+1)/2·u) = q m (q−1)/(q+1) = q ((q+1)/2) u (q−1)/(q+1) = q u (q−1)/2.\\nBecause (q+1)/2 and u have primes < q, but this route gets messy. Instead, test the candidate Mersenne primes and see whether any composite m solution exists.\\nFor q=3 (smallest odd prime), q+1=4, so (q+1)/2 = 2. Thus (q+1)/2 | m implies 2 | m. But primes of m are < 3, so only prime possible is 2, hence m = 2^s, s ≥ 1.\\nThen n = 3·2^s.\\nCompute σ(n): σ(3·2^s) = σ(3)σ(2^s) = 4(2^{s+1} − 1). We need\\nσ(n) = n(q−1) = 3·2^s·2 = 6·2^s.\\nSo 4(2^{s+1} − 1) = 6·2^s ⇒ divide by 2: 2(2^{s+1} − 1) = 3·2^{s} ⇒ 2^{s+2} − 2 = 3·2^{s}.\\nSo 2^{s+2} − 3·2^{s} = 2 ⇒ 2^{s}(4 − 3) = 2 ⇒ 2^{s} = 2 ⇒ s=1.\\nThus m = 2, n = 3·2 = 6. This gives n=6.\\nFor q≥5 with q+1 a power of 2 (q=7,31,127,...), then (q+1)/2 is at least 4. Then any m multiple of (q+1)/2 has a prime factor ≥ (q+1)/2 ≥ 4. In particular, the largest prime factor of m is ≥ prime factor of (q+1)/2, which can be ≥ q/2. But we must still have all primes of m < q, which is possible. However, checking q=7 explicitly is manageable.\\nFor q=5, q+1=6 is not a power of 2, so ruled out.\\nFor q=7, q+1=8, so (q+1)/2=4. Then 4 | m and primes of m < 7, so m can be of form 2^a·3^b·5^c with a ≥ 2. Try small m and see if σ(qm) = qm(q−1) holds:\\nσ(7m) = σ(7)σ(m) = 8 σ(m) and needed 8σ(m) = 7m·6 = 42m ⇒ σ(m) = (42/8)m = (21/4)m. So we need σ(m)/m = 21/4.\\nBut σ(m)/m for m composed of 2,3,5 is a product of factors of the form σ(p^k)/p^k. The maximal such ratio is achieved by taking large powers of small primes. Numerically, σ(2^a)/2^a approaches 2, σ(3^b)/3^b approaches 3/2, σ(5^c)/5^c approaches 6/5. The product’s limit is 2·3/2·6/5 = 18/5 = 3.6 < 21/4 = 5.25, so impossible. Hence no solution for q=7.\\nFor larger Mersenne primes q, the required σ(m)/m value gets even larger (since σ(n)/n = q−1, and with n = q·m, we have σ(m)/m = (q−1) * q/(q+1), which grows with q). Meanwhile for any m with primes < q, σ(m)/m remains bounded above by the product over primes < q of p/(p−1), which grows slowly and is far below needed value for large q. So no further solutions.\\nThus the only solution is n=6.\\n\\nTherefore, for Problem 1, the unique integer n ≥ 2 satisfying σ(n)/(p(n)−1)=n is n=6.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe need all integers n of the form a^2 + b^2, with gcd(a,b)=1, such that for every prime p ≤ √n, p divides ab.\\nEquivalently, every prime ≤ √n divides at least one of a or b.\\nBecause gcd(a,b)=1, no prime can divide both a and b. So the primes ≤ √n are partitioned between divisors of a and divisors of b: each such prime divides exactly one of a,b.\\nLet P_a be the product of distinct primes ≤ √n that divide a, and P_b similarly for b. Then P_a·P_b is the product over all primes ≤ √n. Denote this primorial of √n by Q = ∏_{p ≤ √n} p.\\nThen each prime ≤ √n divides ab, so Q divides |ab|.\\nBasic estimate: any prime ≤ √|ab| divides at least one of a or b is very restrictive. But we also have n = a^2 + b^2.\\n\\nThe condition Q | ab implies |ab| ≥ Q. On the other hand, since a^2 + b^2 = n, by AM-GM we get |ab| ≤ (a^2 + b^2)/2 = n/2.\\nSo Q ≤ |ab| ≤ n/2 ⇒ Q ≤ n/2.\\nBut Q grows faster than √n. For n reasonably large, Q will exceed n/2, giving a contradiction.\\nWe just need to identify precise n where Q ≤ n/2 can hold.\\nCompute Q for ranges of n:\\nLet x = √n. Then Q(x) = ∏_{p ≤ x} p.\\nWe need Q(x) ≤ x^2 / 2.\\nCheck small x manually and ensure that beyond some x, Q(x) > x^2/2 always.\\n\\nCompute Q(x) for integer x:\\nx in [1,2): no primes ≤1, trivial but then n<4.\\nWe care about n that can be expressed as a^2 + b^2 with gcd(a,b)=1 and n≥1.\\nStart enumerating small x:\\n- x < 2 (n < 4): primes ≤x: none, Q = 1. Then condition is vacuous since there is no prime ≤ √n. So any n < 4 that is sum of two coprime squares qualifies.\\nSuch n: 1 = 1^2 + 0^2 (gcd(1,0)=1), 2 = 1^2 + 1^2, 3 not a sum of two squares. So candidate n: 1,2.\\n- For 2 ≤ x < 3 (4 ≤ n < 9): primes ≤x: 2, so Q=2.\\nNeed 2 ≤ n/2 ⇒ n ≥ 4. So possible n = 4,5,6,7,8 by this crude bound. We must then test individually.\\nBut also primality condition: every prime ≤ √n (i.e. just 2) divides ab. So 2 | ab.\\nCheck each n in [4,8] that are sums of two coprime squares:\\n4 = 2^2 + 0^2, but gcd(2,0)=2≠1, so 4 not allowed.\\n5 = 1^2 + 2^2, gcd(1,2)=1. √5≈2.236, primes ≤√5: just 2. Need 2|ab=2, yes. So n=5 works.\\n8 = 2^2 + 2^2 not coprime; 8 also = sqrt not integer other combos? 8 = 1^2+√7^2 impossible, 8=√? So only 2^2+2^2. So 8 not allowed.\\n6 and 7 not sums of two squares (7 is, 7= (±√?); known criterion: prime ≡3 mod4 cannot occur to odd power; 7≡3 mod4 so cannot be sum of two squares). 6 is 1^2+√5^2 no; 6= (√2)^2+√?; no integer representation.\\nSo in this interval we just get n=5.\\nAlso n=1,2 from before.\\n\\nContinue with x in [3,5): i.e. 9≤n<25.\\nPrimes ≤x for different x, but we only need primes ≤√n per n. Let's do via n directly.\\nWe now systematically test n in increasing order until Q>n/2 guarantees no further solutions.\\nCompute Q for x as an integer step function:\\nFor x in [2,3): primes {2}, Q=2.\\nFor x in [3,5): primes {2,3}, Q=6.\\nFor x in [5,7): primes {2,3,5}, Q=30.\\nFor x in [7,11): primes {2,3,5,7}, Q=210.\\nFor x in [11,13): primes {2,3,5,7,11}, Q=2310.\\nAlready Q grows quickly.\\nWe need Q ≤ n/2 = x^2/2.\\nCheck for ranges:\\n1) For x in [3,5): Q=6, need 6 ≤ x^2/2 ⇒ x^2 ≥12 ⇒ x ≥ √12≈3.46. So only for x≥3.46. That means n≥x^2≥12. So for 9≤n<12 (i.e. 9,10,11) the inequality fails. But inequality Q≤n/2 is necessary (not sufficient) for existence; if it fails, no solutions there. For 9≤n<12, we get 9,10,11 rejected automatically.\\nFor 12≤n<25, the necessary inequality holds, so we must test these n individually.\\n2) For x in [5,7): Q=30, need 30 ≤ x^2/2 ⇒ x^2 ≥60 ⇒ x ≥ √60≈7.746, which is not in [5,7). So for any x with 5≤x<7 (i.e., 25≤n<49), Q>n/2. Thus no solutions with 25≤n<49.\\n3) For x≥7, Q=210 already for x in [7,11). Need 210 ≤ x^2/2 ⇒ x^2 ≥420 ⇒ x≥√420≈20.5; but in [7,11),x≤11<20.5, so no solutions there.\\nContinuing, Q only grows, so Q>n/2 for all larger x up to 20.5 anyway. But for n≥(20.5)^2≈420, primes up to x include primes up to at least 19; Q at x>19 is at least 2·3·5·7·11·13·17·19=9699690, which is far bigger than n/2 for n≈400. So indeed for all larger n the inequality fails even more strongly.\\nHence the only possible n must lie below 25, and more narrowly in ranges where Q ≤ n/2 holds, i.e. [1,4) and [4,9) (already checked) and [12,25).\\nWe already found n=1,2,5. Now examine 12≤n<25.\\nList numbers here that are sums of two squares with coprime components.\\nRecall: a positive integer is sum of two squares iff all prime factors ≡3 mod4 appear with even exponent. For small n we can just list.\\nFrom 12 to 24:\\n12 not (12=3·4=3·2^2, but 3 (≡3 mod4) appears to first power ⇒ not sum of two squares).\\n13 = 2^2 + 3^2, gcd(2,3)=1.\\n14=2·7, 7≡3 mod4, exponent 1 ⇒ not.\\n15=3·5 with 3≡3 mod4 exponent 1 ⇒ not.\\n16=4^2+0^2, but gcd(4,0)=4≠1 ⇒ disallowed. 16 also = (±) other combos? 1^2+√15,2^2+√12,3^2+√7, none.\\n17=1^2+4^2, gcd(1,4)=1.\\n18=2·3^2, 3 has exponent 2 even, so sum-of-two-squares; find representation: 18=3^2+3^2 but gcd(3,3)=3≠1, so no coprime representation (there can't be anything else: other attempts 1^2+√17, etc). So 18 excluded.\\n19? 19≡3 mod4? Actually 19≡3 mod4? 16+3=19, yes 19≡3 (mod4), so cannot be sum of two squares.\\n20=4·5, prime factor ≡3 mod4 absent, so yes. Representation: 20=2^2+4^2 (gcd=2), also 20= (±?) 20−1=19,20−4=16=4^2 so 2^2+4^2 only; 20−9=11,20−16=4. So no coprime pair; gcd(2,4)=2⇒disallowed.\\n21=3·7, both ≡3 mod4 exponents odd ⇒ not.\\n22=2·11; 11≡3 mod4? 11≡3 (8+3), yes, exponent 1 odd ⇒ not.\\n23≡3 mod4? 23≡ (20+3) ⇒3 mod4 ⇒ not.\\n24=8·3, factor 3 exponent 1 odd ⇒ not.\\nThus sums of two coprime squares in [12,24] are n=13 and 17.\\nNow check the prime-divisibility condition for these.\\nFor each n, list primes ≤√n and check if each divides ab.\\n1) n=13: representation a^2+b^2 with gcd=1 is ±(2,3) up to ordering. Take a=2,b=3. Then n=13, √13≈3.6055. Primes ≤√13 are 2 and 3.\\na·b=6, divisible by both 2 and 3. So n=13 works.\\n2) n=17: representation a^2+b^2 with gcd=1: ±(1,4). Then √17≈4.123, primes ≤√17 are 2 and 3.\\na·b=4, divisible by 2 but not by 3. So the condition fails. Could there be another coprime representation? Sums of two squares for 17: 1^2+4^2 or permutations/signs only. So no representation makes ab multiple of 3. Therefore n=17 fails.\\nThus within 12≤n<25 only n=13 satisfies the condition.\\n\\nWe also need to consider n=1 and n=2 from before.\\n- n=1: representations of 1 as sum of squares of coprime integers: 1=1^2+0^2, gcd(1,0)=1. √1=1, there is no prime ≤1, so the condition \\\"if p≤√n then p|ab\\\" is vacuously true. So n=1 works.\\n- n=2: 2=1^2 +1^2 with gcd(1,1)=1. √2≈1.414, no prime ≤1.414, so condition is vacuous again. So n=2 works.\\n- n=5 we already saw works.\\nWe argued there can be no other n≥25 because Q>n/2 breaks the necessary inequality.\\n- For 25≤n<49, x in [5,7), Q=30>n/2 (since n≤48⇒n/2≤24). So impossible.\\n- For 49≤n<121, x in [7,11), Q=210>n/2 (n≤120⇒n/2≤60).\\n- For larger x, Q only gets bigger while n ≤ x^2, making Q > n/2 even more pronounced; thus no larger n.\\nTherefore the only n satisfying the condition are n=1,2,5,13.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: n=6.\\nProblem 2: all n are 1,2,5,13.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1, 2, 5, 13\"\n}",
