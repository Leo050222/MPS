Four regions each have central angle x°, and the remaining two regions have central angles 20° and 140°.\\nSum of all central angles = 360°:\\n4x + 20 + 140 = 360\\n4x + 160 = 360\\n4x = 200\\nx = 50.\\nWe are implicitly to assume that the four regions of angle x° are the shaded regions (this is standard for such problems when not otherwise specified). So each shaded region is 50°, and there are 4 such regions.\\nTotal shaded angle = 4 × 50° = 200°.\\nProbability that the arrow lands on a shaded region = shaded angle / total angle = 200 / 360 = 5/9.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe require that (205800, 35k) is a happy pair, meaning gcd(205800, 35k) is a perfect square. We need the number of positive integers k ≤ 2940 satisfying this.\\n\\nStep 1: Prime factorization of 205800 and 35.\\nFirst 205800:\\n205800 = 2058 × 100 = 2058 × (2² × 5²).\\nFactor 2058:\\n2058 ÷ 2 = 1029,\\n1029 ÷ 3 = 343,\\n343 = 7³.\\nSo 2058 = 2 × 3 × 7³.\\nTherefore\\n205800 = (2 × 3 × 7³) × (2² × 5²) = 2³ × 3¹ × 5² × 7³.\\nSo 205800 = 2^3 · 3^1 · 5^2 · 7^3.\\n\\nAlso 35 = 5 × 7.\\nSo 35k = 5 × 7 × k.\\nLet the prime factorization of k be k = 2^a · 3^b · 5^c · 7^d · (other primes), where a, b, c, d ≥ 0, and the exponents of other primes are irrelevant for the gcd with 205800 because 205800 has only primes 2,3,5,7.\\nThen\\n35k = 2^a · 3^b · 5^{c+1} · 7^{d+1} · (other primes).\\n\\nStep 2: Compute gcd(205800, 35k) via prime exponents.\\n205800 = 2^3 · 3^1 · 5^2 · 7^3.\\n35k = 2^a · 3^b · 5^{c+1} · 7^{d+1} · ...\\nThen\\nv2(gcd) = min(3, a)\\nv3(gcd) = min(1, b)\\nv5(gcd) = min(2, c+1)\\nv7(gcd) = min(3, d+1).\\nAll other primes have exponent 0 in gcd.\\nWe need gcd to be a perfect square. A number is a perfect square iff all prime exponents are even. So each of these exponents must be even.\\n\\nThus we require:\\n1) min(3, a) is even\\n2) min(1, b) is even\\n3) min(2, c+1) is even\\n4) min(3, d+1) is even.\\n\\nNow solve each condition separately.\\n\\nCondition for 2-adic exponent:\\nLet e2 = min(3, a). Possible values: 0,1,2,3, but constrained by a.\\nWe require e2 even.\\nConsider values of a:\\n- If a = 0: e2 = min(3,0) = 0 (even) → allowed.\\n- If a = 1: e2 = 1 (odd) → not allowed.\\n- If a = 2: e2 = 2 (even) → allowed.\\n- If a ≥ 3: e2 = 3 (odd) → not allowed.\\nSo allowed a values: a ∈ {0, 2}.\\n\\nCondition for 3-adic exponent:\\nLet e3 = min(1, b). Possible values: 0 or 1.\\nWe need e3 even.\\n- If b = 0: e3 = 0 (even) → allowed.\\n- If b ≥ 1: e3 = 1 (odd) → not allowed.\\nSo allowed b values: b = 0.\\nThus k must not contain factor 3.\\n\\nCondition for 5-adic exponent:\\nLet e5 = min(2, c+1).\\nConsider c:\\n- If c = 0: c+1 = 1 → e5 = min(2,1) = 1 (odd) → not allowed.\\n- If c = 1: c+1 = 2 → e5 = min(2,2) = 2 (even) → allowed.\\n- If c ≥ 2: c+1 ≥ 3 → e5 = min(2, c+1) = 2 (even) → allowed.\\nSo allowed c values: c ≥ 1.\\nEquivalently, k must contain at least one factor 5.\\n\\nCondition for 7-adic exponent:\\nLet e7 = min(3, d+1).\\nConsider d:\\n- If d = 0: d+1 = 1 → e7 = 1 (odd) → not allowed.\\n- If d = 1: d+1 = 2 → e7 = 2 (even) → allowed.\\n- If d = 2: d+1 = 3 → e7 = 3 (odd) → not allowed.\\n- If d ≥ 3: d+1 ≥ 4 → e7 = min(3, d+1) = 3 (odd) → not allowed.\\nSo allowed d values: d = 1 only.\\nEquivalently, k must contain exactly 7^1 and no higher power of 7.\\n\\nThus any valid k must have prime exponents (restricted to primes 2,3,5,7):\\n- v2(k) = a ∈ {0, 2}\\n- v3(k) = 0\\n- v5(k) = c ≥ 1\\n- v7(k) = 1\\n- and may contain other primes (not 2,3,5,7) in any exponent, but recall that k ≤ 2940 so there are bounds.\\n\\nSo write k in the form:\\n\\nk = 2^a · 5^c · 7 · t,\\nwhere a ∈ {0, 2}, c ≥ 1, t is a positive integer with\\n- gcd(t, 2·3·5·7) = 1 (i.e., t has no prime factors 2,3,5,7),\\n- and k ≤ 2940.\\n\\nStep 3: Rewrite the inequality and structure counting.\\nCase split by a.\\n\\nCase 1: a = 0.\\nThen k = 5^c · 7 · t.\\nThe inequality is 5^c · 7 · t ≤ 2940.\\nSo t ≤ 2940 / (7 · 5^c).\\nAnd t must be coprime to 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nCompute the range of c.\\nWe need 7 · 5^c ≤ 2940 → 5^c ≤ 2940/7 = 420 → c must satisfy 5^c ≤ 420.\\nCheck powers:\\n5^1 = 5 ≤ 420,\\n5^2 = 25 ≤ 420,\\n5^3 = 125 ≤ 420,\\n5^4 = 625 > 420.\\nSo c ∈ {1, 2, 3}.\\n\\nFor each c, define N_c = floor(2940 / (7 · 5^c)). We count t ≤ N_c with gcd(t, 2·3·5·7) = 1.\\nSince t is coprime to 5 and 7 and also to 6 = 2·3, equivalently gcd(t, 210) = 1.\\nUse multiplicative density φ(210)/210 on [1, N_c]. But since N_c is small and exact counting is needed, we can compute via multiplicative formula: the count of integers ≤ N_c coprime to 2,3,5,7 is:\\n\\nCount(N_c) = N_c × (1 - 1/2) × (1 - 1/3) × (1 - 1/5) × (1 - 1/7) plus corrections for remainder; but the exact formula is floor-by-floor inclusion–exclusion. However, because 210 is small, a simpler approach is:\\nFor any positive integer M, the number of integers in [1, M] that are coprime to 210 equals:\\n\\nfloor(M/1) - floor(M/2) - floor(M/3) - floor(M/5) - floor(M/7)\\n+ floor(M/6) + floor(M/10) + floor(M/14) + floor(M/15) + floor(M/21) + floor(M/35)\\n- floor(M/30) - floor(M/42) - floor(M/70) - floor(M/105)\\n+ floor(M/210).\\n\\nThis is standard inclusion–exclusion on primes 2,3,5,7.\\nWe'll use this with M = N_c for each c, and similarly later for other cases.\\n\\nBut before that, let’s compute N_c.\\n\\nFor c = 1:\\nDenominator = 7·5^1 = 35.\\nN_1 = floor(2940/35).\\n35 × 80 = 2800; 35 × 84 = 2940.\\nThus N_1 = 84.\\n\\nFor c = 2:\\nDenominator = 7·25 = 175.\\nN_2 = floor(2940/175).\\n175 × 10 = 1750,\\n175 × 15 = 2625,\\n175 × 16 = 2800,\\n175 × 17 = 2975 > 2940.\\nSo N_2 = 16.\\n\\nFor c = 3:\\nDenominator = 7·125 = 875.\\nN_3 = floor(2940/875).\\n875 × 3 = 2625,\\n875 × 4 = 3500 > 2940.\\nSo N_3 = 3.\\n\\nNow count for each M = N_c the numbers ≤ M coprime to 2,3,5,7.\\nDefine function f(M) = # {1 ≤ t ≤ M : gcd(t, 210)=1}.\\nCompute f(84), f(16), f(3).\\n\\nWe can exploit the fact that φ(210) = 48 and the pattern repeats every 210. But M is less than 210 in all cases here (max is 84), so one direct inclusion–exclusion per M is fine.\\n\\nGeneral inclusion–exclusion for primes 2,3,5,7:\\nLet P = {2,3,5,7}.\\nWe want:\\n\\nf(M) = M\\n- (⌊M/2⌋ + ⌊M/3⌋ + ⌊M/5⌋ + ⌊M/7⌋)\\n+ (⌊M/6⌋ + ⌊M/10⌋ + ⌊M/14⌋ + ⌊M/15⌋ + ⌊M/21⌋ + ⌊M/35⌋)\\n- (⌊M/30⌋ + ⌊M/42⌋ + ⌊M/70⌋ + ⌊M/105⌋)\\n+ ⌊M/210⌋.\\n\\nFor f(84):\\nM = 84.\\nCompute floors:\\n⌊84/2⌋ = 42\\n⌊84/3⌋ = 28\\n⌊84/5⌋ = 16\\n⌊84/7⌋ = 12\\nSum1 = 42 + 28 + 16 + 12 = 98.\\n\\nPairs:\\n⌊84/6⌋ = 14\\n⌊84/10⌋ = 8\\n⌊84/14⌋ = 6\\n⌊84/15⌋ = 5\\n⌊84/21⌋ = 4\\n⌊84/35⌋ = 2\\nSum2 = 14 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 39.\\n\\nTriples:\\n⌊84/30⌋ = 2\\n⌊84/42⌋ = 2\\n⌊84/70⌋ = 1\\n⌊84/105⌋ = 0\\nSum3 = 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 5.\\n\\nQuadruple:\\n⌊84/210⌋ = 0.\\n\\nSo\\nf(84) = 84 - 98 + 39 - 5 + 0 = (84 - 98) + (39 - 5) = -14 + 34 = 20.\\nSo there are 20 valid t for c = 1.\\n\\nFor f(16):\\nM = 16.\\nFloors for singles:\\n⌊16/2⌋ = 8\\n⌊16/3⌋ = 5\\n⌊16/5⌋ = 3\\n⌊16/7⌋ = 2\\nSum1 = 8 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 18.\\n\\nPairs:\\n⌊16/6⌋ = 2\\n⌊16/10⌋ = 1\\n⌊16/14⌋ = 1\\n⌊16/15⌋ = 1\\n⌊16/21⌋ = 0\\n⌊16/35⌋ = 0\\nSum2 = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 5.\\n\\nTriples:\\n⌊16/30⌋ = 0\\n⌊16/42⌋ = 0\\n⌊16/70⌋ = 0\\n⌊16/105⌋ = 0\\nSum3 = 0.\\n\\nQuadruple:\\n⌊16/210⌋ = 0.\\n\\nSo\\nf(16) = 16 - 18 + 5 - 0 + 0 = 3.\\nSo there are 3 valid t for c = 2.\\n\\nFor f(3):\\nM = 3.\\nSingles:\\n⌊3/2⌋ = 1\\n⌊3/3⌋ = 1\\n⌊3/5⌋ = 0\\n⌊3/7⌋ = 0\\nSum1 = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2.\\n\\nPairs:\\n⌊3/6⌋ = 0\\n⌊3/10⌋ = 0\\n⌊3/14⌋ = 0\\n⌊3/15⌋ = 0\\n⌊3/21⌋ = 0\\n⌊3/35⌋ = 0\\nSum2 = 0.\\n\\nTriples all 0, quadruple 0.\\n\\nSo\\nf(3) = 3 - 2 + 0 - 0 + 0 = 1.\\nThus there is 1 valid t for c = 3.\\n\\nTotal for Case 1 (a=0):\\nCount_case1 = f(84) + f(16) + f(3) = 20 + 3 + 1 = 24.\\n\\nCase 2: a = 2.\\nThen k = 2^2 · 5^c · 7 · t = 4 · 5^c · 7 · t.\\nInequality: 4 · 5^c · 7 · t ≤ 2940.\\nSo t ≤ 2940 / (28 · 5^c) = 105 / (1 · 5^c) because 2940 / 28 = 105.\\nSo t ≤ 105 / 5^c.\\nAnd again gcd(t, 2·3·5·7) = 1.\\n\\nWe need 28 · 5^c ≤ 2940 → 5^c ≤ 2940/28 = 105.\\nCheck powers of 5:\\n5^1 = 5 ≤ 105,\\n5^2 = 25 ≤ 105,\\n5^3 = 125 > 105.\\nSo c ∈ {1, 2}.\\n\\nCompute bounds:\\nFor c = 1:\\nDenominator = 28 · 5 = 140.\\nBut from formula, t ≤ 105 / 5^1 = 21.\\nCheck directly: k = 4 · 5 · 7 · t = 140t ≤ 2940 → t ≤ 21.
