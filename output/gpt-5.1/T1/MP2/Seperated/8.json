Find its prime factorization:\\n391 ÷ 17 = 23, so 391 = 17 * 23.\\nThus the positive factor pairs of 391 are (1, 391), (17, 23), (23, 17), and (391, 1), where we interpret x as the first factor and (1 + y) as the second factor.\\nCase 1: x = 1, 1 + y = 391 -> y = 390, but then x > y is false (1 is not greater than 390). Discard.\\nCase 2: x = 17, 1 + y = 23 -> y = 22, and x > y is true (17 > 22 is false). Discard.\\nCase 3: x = 23, 1 + y = 17 -> y = 16, and x > y is true since 23 > 16. This is valid.\\nCase 4: x = 391, 1 + y = 1 -> y = 0, but y must be positive. Discard.\\nSo the only valid solution is x = 23 and y = 16.\\nWe are asked for x + y: 23 + 16 = 39.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nThere are 30 people in the room, 60% of whom are men.\\nNumber of men initially: 0.60 * 30 = 18.\\nNumber of women initially: 30 - 18 = 12.\\nLet w be the number of women who enter the room. No men enter or leave, so the number of men remains 18.\\nThe new total number of people is 30 + w, and the number of men is still 18.\\nWe want men to be 40% of the total, so:\\n18 = 0.40 * (30 + w).\\nConvert 0.40 to a fraction: 0.40 = 2/5.\\nSo 18 = (2/5)(30 + w).\\nMultiply both sides by 5: 90 = 2(30 + w).\\nDivide by 2: 45 = 30 + w.\\nSolve for w: w = 45 - 30 = 15.\\nTherefore, 15 women must enter the room.\\n\\nFinal answers: Problem 1: 39; Problem 2: 15.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"39\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"15\"\n}",
