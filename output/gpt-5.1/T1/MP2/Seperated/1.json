  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The computer was turned off at 5 p.m. Friday after being on for exactly 100 hours. First, convert 100 hours to days and hours: 100 ÷ 24 = 4 days with a remainder of 4 hours, so 100 hours = 4 days + 4 hours. To find when it was turned on, we subtract 100 hours from 5 p.m. Friday. Subtract 4 hours from 5 p.m. Friday: 5 p.m. − 4 hours = 1 p.m. Friday. Then subtract 4 days from 1 p.m. Friday: 1 p.m. Thursday (1 day back), 1 p.m. Wednesday (2 days back), 1 p.m. Tuesday (3 days back), 1 p.m. Monday (4 days back). So the computer was turned on at 1 p.m. Monday.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need three different numbers from the list {2, 3, 4, 6} whose sum is 11, then find their product. Consider all combinations of three distinct numbers:\\n- 2 + 3 + 4 = 9\\n- 2 + 3 + 6 = 11\\n- 2 + 4 + 6 = 12\\n- 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\\nThe only combination that sums to 11 is 2, 3, and 6. Their product is 2 × 3 × 6 = 36.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1 p.m. Monday\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"36\"\n}",
