  "math_problem": "The price of each item at the Gauss Gadget Store has been reduced by $20 \\%$ from its original price. An MP3 player has a sale price of $\\\\$ 112$. What would the same MP3 player sell for if it was on sale for $30 \\%$ off of its original price? Instead of computing the sale price under the alternative discount percentage, simply find $k = R - 128$, where $R$ is the original price of the MP3 player determined from the given sale price after the initial discount. For some integers $m$ and $n$, the expression $(x+m)(x+n)$ is equal to a quadratic expression in $x$ with a constant term of $-k$. Which of the following cannot be a value of $m$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First find the original price R. A 20% discount means the sale price is 80% of the original: 0.8R = 112, so R = 112 / 0.8 = 140. Then k = R - 128 = 140 - 128 = 12. The constant term of (x+m)(x+n) is mn, so mn = -k = -12. We list integer factor pairs of -12: (1, -12), (2, -6), (3, -4), (-1, 12), (-2, 6), (-3, 4). Thus possible m values are 1, -12, 2, -6, 3, -4, -1, 12, -2, 6, -3, 4. Any integer not in this set cannot be m. Given typical answer choices for such a problem, the value that cannot be m is 5.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
