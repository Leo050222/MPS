  "math_problem": "If $x$ and $y$ are positive integers with $x+y=31$, what is the largest possible value of $x y$? Instead of finding the largest possible value of the product $x y$, simply find $k$, which is that largest value minus 231. If a line segment joins the points $(-k,-2)$ and $(6,8)$, how many points on the line segment have coordinates that are both integers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We want to maximize xy subject to x + y = 31 with x, y positive integers. The product xy = x(31 - x) is a quadratic in x opening downward, so its maximum occurs at the vertex near x = 31/2. For integers, check x = 15 and x = 16. Then y = 16 or 15 respectively, giving xy = 15·16 = 240 (both cases). So the largest possible product is 240. We are told k is this maximum minus 231, so k = 240 - 231 = 9. Now consider the line segment joining (-k, -2) and (6, 8). Since k = 9, the endpoints are (-9, -2) and (6, 8). The vector from (-9, -2) to (6, 8) is (6 - (-9), 8 - (-2)) = (15, 10). Lattice points on a segment between two lattice endpoints occur at integer steps along the direction of the primitive step vector, whose components are (15/g, 10/g) where g = gcd(15, 10). Here gcd(15, 10) = 5, so the step is (3, 2). This means the number of lattice points on the segment (including endpoints) equals g + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6. Therefore there are 6 points on the line segment with integer coordinates.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
