  "math_problem": "Storage space on a computer is measured in gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB), where $1 \\mathrm{~GB} = 1024 \\mathrm{MB}$. Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes. The regular price for a bicycle is $\\\\$320$. The bicycle is on sale for $20\\\\%$ off. The regular price for a helmet is $\\\\$80$. The helmet is on sale for $10\\\\%$ off. If Sandra bought both items on sale, her percentage savings on the total purchase is $\\left( \\frac{\\text{total savings}}{\\text{total price}} \\right) \\times d\\\\%$. Compute this value.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"1) Convert hard drive capacity to MB: C = 300 GB × 1024 MB/GB = 300 × 1024 = 307200 MB. 2) Compute d = C − 307100 = 307200 − 307100 = 100. 3) Compute regular total price: bike $320 + helmet $80 = $400. 4) Compute sale prices and savings: bike is 20% off → savings = 0.20 × 320 = 64, sale price = 320 − 64 = 256. Helmet is 10% off → savings = 0.10 × 80 = 8, sale price = 80 − 8 = 72. 5) Total savings = 64 + 8 = 72. Total sale price (amount paid) = 256 + 72 = 328. 6) Base percentage savings on total purchase = (total savings / total price) × 100% if using a normal definition, but the problem defines the final percentage savings as (total savings / total price) × d%, where d = 100. 7) Compute (total savings / total price) × d% as a numerical value: (72 / 400) × 100 = 0.18 × 100 = 18. 8) Thus the requested value is 18.\",\n    \"answer\": \"18\"\n}",
