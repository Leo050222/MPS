  "math_problem": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$. Shuxin begins with $d$ red candies, 7 yellow candies, and 3 blue candies. After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining. What is the smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Let the number of skateboards be 7k and bicycles be 4k. We are told there are 12 more skateboards than bicycles: 7k - 4k = 12 ⇒ 3k = 12 ⇒ k = 4. Then d = k + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10, so Shuxin starts with d = 10 red candies, 7 yellow, and 3 blue. Let the final equal number of each color be N. Since Shuxin can only eat candies (not add), N must be at most the smallest initial count, which is 3 (blue). So N ∈ {0,1,2,3}. The number eaten is (10 - N) + (7 - N) + (3 - N) = 20 - 3N. To minimize the number eaten, maximize N; the largest possible is N = 3. Then total eaten = 20 - 3·3 = 11. Therefore, the smallest possible number of candies Shuxin ate is 11.\",\n    \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
