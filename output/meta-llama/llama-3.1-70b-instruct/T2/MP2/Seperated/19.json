The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill 11. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We are given a system of three equations involving x, y, z. From the equations, express z in terms of x and y, then substitute into the other equations to reduce variables. Solve for y in terms of x, and then find z. Equations: xy + z = 40, xz + y = 51, x + y + z = 19. From the third, z = 19 - x - y. Substitute into the first: xy + (19 - x - y) = 40 => xy + 19 - x - y = 40 => xy - x - y = 21 (Equation A). Substitute z into the second: x(19 - x - y) + y = 51 => 19x - x^2 - xy + y = 51. From Equation A, xy = 21 + x + y, so replace xy: 19x - x^2 - (21 + x + y) + y = 51 => 19x - x^2 - 21 - x - y + y = 51 => (19x - x - x^2 - 21) = 51 => (18x - x^2 - 21) = 51 => -x^2 + 18x - 21 = 51 => -x^2 + 18x = 72 => x^2 - 18x = -72. Complete the square: x^2 - 18x + 81 = 9 => (x - 9)^2 = 9. So, x - 9 = ±3 => x = 12 or x = 6. For x=12: from Equation A: xy = 21 + 12 + y => xy = 33 + y. But xy = 21 + x + y = 21 + 12 + y = 33 + y, so consistent. From xy = 33 + y, since x=12, 12y = 33 + y => 11y = 33 => y=3. Then z=19 - x - y = 19 - 12 - 3 = 4. First set: (12, 3, 4). For x=6: xy = 21 + 6 + y => xy = 27 + y. But xy = 21 + 6 + y = 27 + y, consistent. With x=6, 6y = 27 + y => 5y = 27 => y=27/5. Then z=19 - 6 - 27/5 = 19 - 6 - 5.4 = 19 - 11.4 = 7.6. So the second solution: (6, 27/5, 38/5). Final step: check values back, all consistent. Therefore, solutions are (12, 3, 4) and (6, 27/5, 38/5).\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"[{\\\"x\\\": 12, \\\"y\\\": 3, \\\"z\\\": 4}, {\\\"x\\\": 6, \\\"y\\\": \\\"27/5\\\", \\\"z\\\": \\\"38/5\\\"}]\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
