  "math_problem": "Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. Friday, at which point it had been on for exactly 100 hours. At what time had Kamile turned her computer on? Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day. Three different numbers from the list $2, 3, 4, 6$ have a sum of $k$. What is the product of these numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. on Friday, and it had been on for exactly 100 hours.\n2. To find the time she turned it on, we add 100 hours to 5 p.m. Friday.\n3. Calculate how many days and hours that is:\n   - 100 hours = 4 days and 4 hours (since 4 days = 96 hours, remaining 4 hours).\n4. Add 4 days and 4 hours to Friday 5 p.m.\n   - Adding 4 days to Friday 5 p.m. brings us to Tuesday 5 p.m.\n   - Add 4 hours to Tuesday 5 p.m. results in Tuesday 9 p.m.\n5. Therefore, Kamile turned her computer on at Tuesday 9 p.m.\n\nNext, we do the following:\n\n- Determine the total duration (100 hours) modulo the number of hours in a day (24 hours):\n\n  \\( h = 100 \\mod 24 = 100 - 4 \\times 24 = 100 - 96 = 4 \\).\n\n- Compute \\( k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \\).\n\nThe list of numbers is 2, 3, 4, 6.\n\n- Find three different numbers from this list that sum to \\( k = 11 \\):\n\n  Let's check combinations:\n  - 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 → sums to 11\n  - 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 → too high\n  - 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 → too high\n  - 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 → too low\n\n  Only the combination 2, 3, and 6 sums to 11.\n\nFinally, the product of these numbers:\n\n\\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 6 = 36 \\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"36\"\n}\n```",
