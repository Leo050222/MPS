  "math_problem": "Solve for $2d$ if $10d + 8 = 528$. Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance $s$ equal to that solution plus 48. Megan and Hana raced their remote control cars for $s$ m. The two cars started at the same time. The average speed of Megan's car was $\\frac{5}{4} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Hana's car finished 5 seconds before Megan's car. What was the average speed of Hana's car?",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. Solve the linear equation for \\(d\\): \\(10d + 8 = 528\\).\n\n   Subtract 8 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   10d = 520\n   \\]\n\n   Divide both sides by 10:\n   \\[\n   d = 52\n   \\]\n\n2. The race distance \\(s\\) is equal to this solution \\(d\\) plus 48:\n   \\[\n   s = d + 48 = 52 + 48 = 100\n   \\]\n\n3. Megan's average speed is given as \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\) m/s.\n\n4. Find Megan's time to finish the race:\n   \\[\n   t_M = \\frac{s}{\\text{speed}_M} = \\frac{100}{\\frac{5}{4}} = 100 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 80 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n5. Hana finishes 5 seconds before Megan:\n   \\[\n   t_H = t_M - 5 = 80 - 5 = 75 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n6. Calculate Hana's average speed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{speed}_H = \\frac{s}{t_H} = \\frac{100}{75} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ m/s}\n   \\]\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\n    \"answer\": \"4/3\"\n}\n```",
