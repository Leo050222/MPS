  "math_problem": "If \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers with \\( x>y \\) and \\( x+x y=391 \\), what is the value of \\( x+y \\)? Instead of finding the sum of the two positive integers satisfying the given equation and inequality, simply find \\( k = y + 14 \\), where \\( y \\) is the smaller positive integer in the pair that solves the equation under the stated conditions. There are \\( k \\) people in a room, 60% of whom are men. If no men enter or leave the room, how many women must enter the room so that 40% of the total number of people in the room are men?",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze the first part of the problem:\n\nGiven the equation: \\(x + xy = 391\\), with \\(x, y\\) positive integers, \\(x > y\\).\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation to factor it:\n\\[ x + xy = x(1 + y) = 391 \\]\n\nStep 2: Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers, \\(x\\) divides 391:\n\\[ x \\mid 391 \\]\n\nStep 3: Find the divisors of 391:\n- 391 factors as \\( 391 = 17 \\times 23 \\), both prime.\n\nDivisors are: 1, 17, 23, 391.\n\nHowever, since \\(x > y > 0\\), and \\(x\\) must be a divisor of 391, the possible values for \\(x\\) are 17, 23, 391, but not 1 because \\(x > y\\) and both are positive integers.\n\nStep 4: For each possible \\(x\\), find \\(1 + y = 391 / x\\), then compute \\(y\\):\n\n- When \\(x = 17\\):\n  \\[\n  1 + y = 391/17 = 23\n  \\implies y = 22\n  \\]\n  Check if \\(x > y\\):\n  \\[\n  17 > 22 \\text{? No}, \\text{ so discard}\n  \\]\n\n- When \\(x = 23\\):\n  \\[\n  1 + y = 391/23 = 17\n  \\implies y = 16\n  \\]\n  Check if \\(x > y\\):\n  \\[\n  23 > 16 \\quad \\text{Yes}\n  \\]\n  Both positive integers, so \\((x, y) = (23, 16)\\).\n\n- When \\(x = 391\\):\n  \\[\n  1 + y = 391/391 = 1\n  \\implies y= 0\n  \\]\n  But \\(y\\) must be positive, so discard.\n\nThus, the valid pair is \\((x, y) = (23, 16)\\).\n\nStep 5: Find \\(k = y + 14\\):\n\\[\nk = 16 + 14 = 30\n\\]\n\n---\n\nFor the second part:\n\nInitial number of people: \\(k = 30\\).\n\n60% are men, so:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men} = 0.6 \\times 30 = 18\n\\]\n\nNumber of women initially:\n\\[\n30 - 18 = 12\n\\]\n\nLet \\(w\\) be the number of women entering.\n\nTotal new number of people:\n\\[\n30 + w\n\\]\n\nNumber of men remains 18 as no men leave or enter. We want the new percentage of men to be 40%:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{30 + w} = 0.4\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(w\\):\n\n\\[\n18 = 0.4(30 + w)\n\\]\n\\[\n18 = 12 + 0.4w\n\\]\n\\[\n18 - 12 = 0.4w\n\\]\n\\[\n6 = 0.4w\n\\]\n\\[\nw = \\frac{6}{0.4} = 15\n\\]\n\n---\n\nFinal answer in requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"answer\": \"30\"\n}\n```",
