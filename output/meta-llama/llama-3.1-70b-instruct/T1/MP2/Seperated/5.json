  "reasoning_content": "Let's solve each problem step by step.\n\n**Problem 1:**\n\n1. The ratio of skateboards to bicycles is 7:4.\n2. Let the number of skateboards be 7x and bicycles be 4x.\n3. We know there are 12 more skateboards than bicycles:\n   7x = 4x + 12\n4. Solve for x:\n   7x - 4x = 12\n   3x = 12\n   x = 4\n5. Now, calculate total skateboards and bicycles:\n   Skateboards = 7 * 4 = 28\n   Bicycles = 4 * 4 = 16\n6. Total = 28 + 16 = 44\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\n1. Initial candies:\n   Red = 10, Yellow = 7, Blue = 3\n2. After eating some candies, remaining candies of each color are equal:\n   Let the remaining number of each color be R.\n3. For red: remaining = R, so candies eaten from red = 10 - R\n   For yellow: remaining = R, eaten = 7 - R\n   For blue: remaining = R, eaten = 3 - R\n4. Total candies eaten = (10 - R) + (7 - R) + (3 - R) = 20 - 3R\n5. To minimize candies eaten, maximize R, but R cannot be more than the smallest initial count (which is 3), because:\n   R ≤ 3\n6. To make all remaining equal, R must be ≤ 3.\n7. Choose R as large as possible, i.e., R = 3.\n8. Candies eaten:\n   Red: 10 - 3 = 7\n   Yellow: 7 - 3 = 4\n   Blue: 3 - 3 = 0\n9. Total candies eaten = 7 + 4 + 0 = 11\n\n---\n\n**Final step:** Present the reasoning and answers in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The ratio is 7:4, so let skateboards = 7x and bicycles = 4x.
