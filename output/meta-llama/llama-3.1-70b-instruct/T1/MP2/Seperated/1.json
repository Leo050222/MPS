  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, Kamile's computer was on for 100 hours before 5 p.m. on Friday. To find the time she turned it on, subtract 100 hours from 5 p.m. Friday. 100 hours equals 4 days and 4 hours. Subtracting 4 days from Friday 5 p.m. brings us to Monday 5 p.m. (since we go back four days). Then subtracting 4 hours from Monday 5 p.m. gives us Monday 1 p.m. Therefore, Kamile turned on her computer at 1 p.m. on Monday.\\n\\nFor Problem 2, the numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6. We need to find three numbers from these that sum to 11.\\n- Testing combinations:\\n  - 2 + 3 + 6 = 11\\n  - 2 + 4 + 6 = 12\\n  - 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\\n  - 2 + 3 + 4 = 9\\n  - 2 + 4 + 6 (already checked)\\n  - 3 + 4 + 6 (already checked)\\n  The only combination that sums to 11 is 2, 3, and 6.\\nThe product of 2, 3, and 6 is 2 * 3 * 6 = 36.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"Monday 1 p.m.\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"36\"\n}",
