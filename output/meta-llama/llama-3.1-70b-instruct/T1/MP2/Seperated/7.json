The remaining two regions have angles of 20° and 140°, adding up to 160°. The sum of all angles is 360°, so 4x + 20 + 140 = 360. Simplify: 4x + 160 = 360, thus 4x = 200, giving x = 50°. The shaded regions are the four regions with angle 50°, totaling 4 * 50° = 200°. The probability that the arrow stops in the shaded region is the ratio of shaded region angles to the circle, which is 200/360 = 5/9.\\n\\nProblem 2: For (205800, 35k) to be a happy pair, gcd(205800, 35k) must be a perfect square. First, find gcd(205800, 35k). Since gcd(a, bc) = gcd(a, b * c) and is divisibility, we analyze gcd(205800, 35k).\\n\\nPrime factor 205800:\\n205800 / 2 = 102900\\n102900 / 2 = 51450\\n51450 / 2 = 25725 (not divisible further by 2)\\n25725 / 3 = 8575\\n8575 / 5 = 1715\\n1715 / 5 = 343\\n343 = 7^3\\nThus, 205800 factors as 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^2 * 7^3.\\n\\nPrime factor 35:\\n35 = 5 * 7.\\n\\nSo gcd(205800, 35k) = gcd(2^3 * 3^1 * 5^2 * 7^3, 5 * 7 * k).\\n\\nThe gcd must contain at least 5^1 and 7^1 because of 35, so gcd includes 5^1 and 7^1. The gcd's other prime factors depend on k. For gcd to be a perfect square, the exponents of all primes in gcd must be even.\\n\\nPrimarily, |gcd(205800, 35k)| = 5^{min(2, e_5)} * 7^{min(3, e_7)} * other primes, where e_5 and e_7 are exponents in k's prime factorization for 5 and 7.\\n\\nFrom gcd conditions:\\n- e_5 ≥ 1 (since gcd includes 5^1), and min(2, e_5) must be even,\\n   so min(2, e_5) can be 2 (even), thus e_5 ≥ 2, meaning e_5 ≥ 2 for the gcd to be a perfect square.\\n- e_7 ≥ 1, and min(3, e_7) must be even, so min(3, e_7) can be 2, which is even, so e_7 ≥ 2.\\n\\nThus, in k:\\n- e_5 ≥ 2 (exponent of 5 in k) and e_5 can be ≥ 2,\\n- e_7 ≥ 2,\\n- For other primes, they can be any exponents.\\n\\nNow, since gcd(205800,35k) divides 205800, which has exponents: 2^3, 3^1, 5^2, 7^3, and the gcd must include at least 5^2 and 7^2, the exponents in gcd for these primes are fixed at 2, 2.\\n\\nIn particular, the key is that the exponents of 5 and 7 in k must be at least 2, and their gcd exponents are exactly 2, which is a perfect square.\\n\\nk is positive integer, and we need to count how many such k satisfy these conditions with k ≤ 2940.\\n\\nExpress e_5 and e_7 for k:\\n- e_5 ≥ 2,\\ e_5 can be any integer ≥ 2.\\n- e_7 ≥ 2.\\n- For other primes, no restrictions.\\n\\nNow, since 5^e_5 * 7^e_7 divides k, and k ≤ 2940.\\n\\nPrime factorization of 2940:\\n2940 / 2 = 1470\\n1470 / 2 = 735\\n735 / 3 = 245\\n245 / 5 = 49\\n49 = 7^2\\nSo, 2940 = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1 * 7^2.\\n\\nAny k ≤ 2940 can only have prime factors less than or equal to 2940, and for the primes 5 and 7, the exponents must be at least 2 for 5 and 2 for 7, but exponent can't exceed the maximum in 2940. But note that 5^e_5 in k, with e_5 ≥ 2, and similarly for 7.\\n\\nSince 5^1 is in 2940, but our e_5 ≥ 2, we must check if e_5 = 2, 3,... up to the maximum exponent such that 5^e_5 ≤ 2940.\\n\\nSimilarly for 7: 7^{e_7} with e_7 ≥ 2.\\n\\nCheck maximum e_5:\\ 5^{e_5} ≤ 2940:\\ 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125 > 2940, so max e_5=4.\\nSimilarly for 7: 7^2=49, 7^3=343, 7^4=2401, 7^5=16807 > 2940, so max e_7=4.\\n\\nPossible e_5 values: 2,3,4.\\nPossible e_7 values: 2,3,4.\\n\\nNow, for each combination of e_5 and e_7, define k = 5^{e_5} * 7^{e_7} * other factors, where other prime factors can be any primes less than or equal to 2940 / (5^{e_5} * 7^{e_7}).\\n\\nSince 5^{e_5} * 7^{e_7} ≤ 2940, and for each pair, the number of multiplicative combinations for other primes is the count of divisors of the remaining part that are less than or equal to the remaining quotient.\\n\\nNumber of k for each pair = number of divisors of the remaining part, bounded by the remaining factors.\\n\\nBut since the exponents of other primes are unrestricted (their exponents can be zero or higher), and the only restriction for the value of k is that the product of all prime powers ≤ 2940, the total count boils down to the number of combinations where the prime powers for 5 and 7 are within their respective bounds, and the remaining part of k divides the quotient 2940 / (5^{e_5} * 7^{e_7}) and is composed of primes with exponents ≤ their maximum for that quotient.\\n\\nThus, the total count is obtained by summing over e_5 = 2..4 and e_7=2..4 of the number of divisors of 2940 / (5^{e_5} * 7^{e_7}).\\n\\nCalculations:\\n- For (e_5, e_7) = (2, 2):\\ 5^2=25, 7^2=49,\\ 2940 / (25*49)=2940/1225=2.4 (not an integer), discard.\\n- For (2, 3): 25*343=8575, >2940, discard.\\n- For (2, 4): 25*2401=60025 > 2940, discard.\\n- For (3, 2): 125*49=6125 >2940, discard.\\n- For (3, 3): 125*343=42975 >2940, discard.\\n- For (3, 4): 125*2401 >2940, discard.\\n- For (4, 2): 625*49=30625 >2940, discard.\\n- For (4, 3): 625*343 >2940, discard.\\n- For (4, 4): 625*2401 >2940, discard.\\n\\nAll these either produce products exceeding 2940 or non-integer quotients, meaning only the pairs (e_5, e_7) = (2, 2) satisfy the condition with quotient integral.\\n\\nBut since the quotient is not an integer in other pairs, only the pair (2, 2) works, corresponding to k divisible by 25 and 49, and their product exactly divides 2940?\\n\\nCheck: 25*49=1225, 2940/1225=2.4, not integer.\\n\\nTherefore, no such k with e_5 ≥ 2 and e_7 ≥ 2 satisfy the divisibility condition.\\n\\nHowever, since gcd includes at least e_5=2 and e_7=2, the only possibility is when k is divisible by the minimal powers 25 and 49 simultaneously that are the only factors satisfying the bounds.\\n\\nBut from above, 1225 doesn't divide 2940 evenly, so no k exist with both exponents reaching those maximums.\\n\\nAlternative approach: Since gcd must be a perfect square, and the gcd divides both 205800 and 35k:\\n- For gcd to be a perfect square, all prime exponents in gcd are even.\\n- gcd divides 205800, which includes 2^3, 3^1, 5^2, 7^3. \\n- The minimal exponents for gcd are the minimum between those in 205800 and those in 35k:\\nIn particular, the exponents of gcd are at most 2 for 5 and 2 for 7 (since 205800 has 5^2 and 7^3, and gcd exponents max at the smaller of exponents in both numbers).\\n- To ensure gcd is a perfect square, the exponents of gcd for prime 7 must be even, so in gcd, exponent of 7 is 2 (since 3 in 205800, but must be at most 2 for gcd, and we need even). Similarly for 5, it's 2.\\n\\nIn summary, the gcd's exponents of 5 and 7 are fixed at e_5=2, e_7=2.\\n- For gcd to be that, e_5 and e_7 in k must be at least 2, and e_5 in 35k: e_5(k) ≥ 2. Similarly for e_7.\\n- But the maximum exponents are constrained by 2940.\\n\\nSince 5^{e_5} divides k, with e_5 ≥ 2, and 5^{4} ≤ 2940, e_5 can be 2, 3, or 4.\\nSimilarly for 7: e_7=2, 3, or 4.\\n\\nNow, for each of these values, the total product 5^{e_5} * 7^{e_7} ≤ 2940?\\nCheck maximum:\\n- 5^4=625, 7^4=2401,\\ 625*2401=1,502,625 > 2940, discard.\\n- 5^3=125, 7^3=343,\\ 125*343=42,875 > 2940, discard.\\n- 5^2=25, 7^2=49,\\ 25*49=1225 ≤ 2940, acceptable.\\n\\nOnly with (e_5,e_7) = (2,2), the product divides 2940?\\nYes, because 1225 divides 2940? 2940/1225=2.4, no.\\nSo 1225 doesn't divide 2940 exactly, so no.\\n\\nThus, the conclusion is that the only possibility is when e_5=2 and e_7=2, but this does not produce an integer divisor of 2940.\\n\\nTherefore, the only way for gcd to be a perfect square is if gcd divides 205800 and is a perfect square, and gcd divides 35k and is a perfect square, which implies that gcd divides 205800 and that gcd divides 35k. But in the original problem, the key is that gcd(205800, 35k) is a perfect square, so the exponents of its prime factorization must be even, and the gcd divides both 205800 and 35k.\\n\\nSince 205800 factors as 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^2 * 7^3, for gcd to be a perfect square, the exponents in gcd must be even, thus 2^even * 3^0 or 1 * 5^2 * 7^2. But the maximum exponents in 205800 for 2 and 7 are 3 and 3, respectively. To get a perfect square dividing 205800, exponents of 2 and 7 in gcd should be 0 or 2, since exponents of 3 are 1, which cannot be included in a perfect square, as the exponent would have to be even; so 3 must be zero (no 3 in gcd).\"\n\nThus, gcd of 205800 and 35k must be divisible by 5^2 and 7^2, with exponents at most 2, and 2^0 or 2^2, respectively.\n\nFrom that, gcd is 5^2 * 7^2=1225.\n\nSince gcd divides both 205800 and 35k:\n- 1225 divides 205800. Is 1225 dividing 205800? 205800/1225=168, so yes.\n- Also, 1225 divides 35k, so 35k is divisible by 1225.\n\nBecause 1225=5^2*7^2, and 35=5*7, then 35k divisible by 1225 implies:\n- 1225 divides 35k,\n- 35*k divisible by 1225,\n- Divide both sides by 35: (1225/35) divides k,\n- 1225/35=35.\n\nTherefore, 35 divides k.\n\nNow, k = 35 * t, for some positive integer t.\n\nRecall k ≤ 2940,\n- So 35 * t ≤ 2940,\n- t ≤ 2940/35 = 84.\n\nSince 1225 divides 35k if and only if 35 divides k, which is equivalent to k divisible by 35, and we have k=35 * t with t=1,2,...,84.\n\nFurthermore, for gcd(205800, 35k) to be 1225, the gcd's prime exponents for 2 and 3 do not impact because they are odd exponents in 205800; only the exponents for 5 and 7 matter for the gcd being a perfect square.\n\nHence, the total number of suitable k's is the number of integers t from 1 to 84, such that k=35t, i.e., t=1..84.\n\nSince k=35t, and k must be an integer, and gcd(205800, 35k)=1225, satisfying the above, the count is 84.\n\n**Final Step:** The possible values of k are all multiples of 35 up to 2940, with t=1..84. Each such k produces gcd 1225, a perfect square. All these satisfy conditions.\n\n**Answer to Problem 2:** 84\n\n---\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The circle is divided into six regions with known angles for four regions in terms of x and the other two given angles. Summing all gives 4x + 20 + 140 = 360, leading to 4x=200, so x=50. The shaded regions are the four with x=50°, totaling 200°. The probability is thus 200/360 = 5/9. \\n\\nProblem 2: For (205800, 35k) to be a happy pair, gcd must be a perfect square dividing both numbers. Prime factorization of 205800 shows exponents 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^2 * 7^3. The gcd's prime exponents that form a perfect square are constrained: exponents for 5 and 7 must be 2, with others zero, since 205800's exponents for 2 and 3 are odd and cannot be part of the gcd if they are to produce a perfect square. The gcd is then 1225, dividing 205800; for it to divide 35k, 35k must be divisible by 1225. Because 1225=5^2*7^2 and 35=5*7, divisibility implies that 35 divides k. The maximum t in k=35t with k ≤ 2940 is t=84. All such t produce valid k; thus, there are 84 possible values.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5/9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"84\"\n}",
