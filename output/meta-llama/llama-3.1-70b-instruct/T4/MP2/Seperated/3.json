  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1 involves finding primes \\(p, q, r\\) satisfying divisibility conditions. Since all are prime, consider the smallest primes and analyze the divisibility relations: \\(p \\mid q^r + 1\\), \\(q \\mid r^p + 1\\), and \\(r \\mid p^q + 1\\). For \\(p=2\\), \\(q=2\\), or \\(r=2\\), some relations simplify significantly. Checking cases, the minimal solutions where these relations hold are when \\( (p, q, r) = (2, 3, 2) \\) or permutations thereof that satisfy the divisibility conditions. The key is to verify if other larger primes can satisfy all three relations, but the symmetry and divisibility constraints suggest the only solutions are those involving small primes. For Problem 2, each move replaces two numbers \\(a, b\\) with 1 and \\(a+b\\), and adds stones to the buckets: 1 stone to the first bucket, and \\(\\gcd(a, b)\\) stones to the second. Starting from \\(n\\) ones, the total sum increases by 1 in the first bucket each move, totaling \\(s\\), equal to the number of moves. The sum of all numbers increases to \\(n + s\\), and the total stones in the second bucket tally the sum of gcd's over the sequence. Ultimately, the ratio \\(\\frac{t}{s}\\) can be shown to depend only on the initial structure and the gcd properties, leading to the conclusion that \\(t = n-1\\) and \\(s = n-1\\), so the ratio \\(\\frac{t}{s}\\) is 1.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"(2, 3, 2)\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
