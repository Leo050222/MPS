  "reasoning_content": "Let's proceed with each problem step-by-step.\n\n**Problem 1: Find all integers n ≥ 2 satisfying (σ(n)) / (p(n) - 1) = n**\n\nStep 1: Understand the notation\n- σ(n): sum of positive divisors of n\n- p(n): largest prime divisor of n\n- The equation: σ(n) / (p(n) - 1) = n\n\nStep 2: Rewrite the problem\np(n) is the greatest prime dividing n, and the equation involves both the sum of divisors and p(n). The key is to analyze possible forms of n based on p(n).\n\nStep 3: Start with small n\nSuppose n is a prime power: n = p^k\n- σ(n) = 1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^k = (p^{k+1} - 1)/(p - 1)\n- p(n) = p\n- Equation: σ(n) / (p - 1) = n\nSo:\n(p^{k+1} - 1)/(p - 1) / (p - 1) = p^k\n=> (p^{k+1} - 1)/(p - 1)^2 = p^k\n\nCheck for small p:\n\n- For p=2:\nEquation: σ(2^k) = (2^{k+1} - 1)/(2 - 1) = 2^{k+1} - 1\nThen σ(2^k) / (2-1) = 2^{k+1} - 1\nSet equal to 2^k:\n(2^{k+1} - 1) / 1 = 2^k\n=> 2^{k+1} - 1 = 2^k\n=> 2^{k+1} = 2^k + 1\n=> 2*2^k = 2^k + 1\n=> 2^k (2 - 1) = 1\n=> 2^k = 1\n=> k=0\nBut k=0 corresponds to n=2^0=1, but n≥2, so invalid.\n\nTry p=3:\nσ(3^k) = (3^{k+1}-1)/(3-1) = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\nEquation:\n(3^{k+1} - 1)/2 / (3 - 1) = n\n=> (3^{k+1} - 1)/2 / 2 = n\n=> (3^{k+1} - 1)/4 = 3^k\nSet equal:\n(3^{k+1} - 1)/4 = 3^k\n=> 3^{k+1} - 1 = 4*3^k\n=> 3*3^k - 1 = 4*3^k\n=> 3*3^k - 4*3^k = 1\n=> (3^k)(3 - 4) = 1\n=> -3^k = 1\nContradiction, as 3^k > 0.\n\nSimilarly, for larger primes, the equation becomes impossible unless the divisor sum simplifies appropriately. It's likely no solutions occur for prime powers larger than 2.\n\nStep 4: Check for composite n with multiple prime factors\nSuppose n has two distinct prime factors, say n = p^a * q^b.\n- p(n) is the largest prime divisor, say p\n- p divides n\n- σ(n) = σ(p^a) * σ(q^b) * ... (multiplicative over coprime factors)\n\nTry n=6:\np(6)=3\nσ(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12\nCheck the condition:\n12/(3-1)= 12/2=6, which matches n=6\nThus, n=6 satisfies the condition.\n\nCheck n=12:\np(12)=? Largest prime divisor is  competent to checkg it if 12 is divisible by 3 or 2.\n\nDivisors of 12:\n1,2,3,4,6,12\np(12)= 3\nσ(12) = 1+2+3+4+6+12=28\nCalculate:\n28/(3-1)=28/2=14 ≠12\nNo; so 12 doesn't satisfy.\n\nCheck n=18:\nDivisors: 1,2,3,6,9,18\np(18)= 3\nσ(18)=1+2+3+6+9+18=39\n39/2=19.5 ≠18\n\nCheck n=20:\nDivisors: 1,2,4,5,10,20\np(20)= 5\nσ(20)=1+2+4+5+10+20=42\n42/(5-1)=42/4=10.5 ≠20\n\nSimilarly, in the case of n=6, the condition holds. Other candidates should be checked; as the example suggests, n=6 is a solution.\n\n**Summary for Problem 1:**\n- For n=6, the condition is satisfied.\n- For prime powers, no solutions other than trivial or contradictions.\n- For composite n, other than 6, no evident solutions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only solution satisfying all conditions is n=6.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2: n of form a^2 + b^2 with gcd(a, b)=1, such that if p ≤ √n, then p divides a*b**\n\nStep 1: Understand the conditions\n- n=a^2 + b^2\n- gcd(a, b)=1\n- For all primes p ≤ √n, p divides a or p divides b (since p divides a*b)\n\nStep 2: Known fact\n- If p divides p(a, b), then p divides a or b.\n- Since gcd(a, b)=1, p dividing a or b means p is a prime factor of a or b separately\n- The condition applies to all primes ≤ √n\n\nStep 3: Interpretation\n- All primes p ≤ √n are divisors of a or b\n- Since primes larger than √n are not constrained.\n\nStep 4: Analysis\nSuppose that all primes ≤ √n divide a or b.\n- If a and b are coprime and their prime divisors among small primes cover all primes up to √n, then a and b are divisible by all these primes.\n- But a and b are coprime, so the only way is that one of them retains all small prime factors.\n\nSuppose a is divisible by all primes p ≤ √n, and b shares no such small primes, then gcd(a, b)=1 holds.\n\nNow, because n=a^2 + b^2, and a is divisible by all small primes, and b shares no such primes (i.e., small primes do not divide b).\n\nSince a is divisible by all primes p ≤ √n, and the small primes p are less than or equal to √n, then a ≥ the product of all primes ≤ √n.\n\nSimilarly for b, but since gcd(a, b)=1, probably only one of them carries all small primes.\n\nLet's analyze the minimal case:\n\n- Suppose a is divisible by all primes p ≤ √n\n- And b is coprime with a: gcd(a, b)=1\n- n=a^2 + b^2\n- For primes p ≤ √n, p divides a or b\n\nNow, given that, and that p divides a, p divides a^2\n- Therefore p divides n, since n = a^2 + b^2 and p divides a^2 + b^2, p divides a^2, so p divides n.\n\nSimilarly, p divides n for all p ≤ √n.\n\nHence, the product of all primes p ≤ √n divides a (or b), which divides n’s divisors.\n\nConsider the possibility with simplest case: a=1 and b such that b^2=n - 1.\n\nBut a=1, gcd(1,b)=1 always, and the primes ≤ √n are those less than or equal to sqrt(n).\n\nCheck some examples:\n\n- For n=1^2+0^2=1; trivial\n- For n=2: 1^2+1^2=2; primes ≤√2 ≈1.4 are prime 2? 2 divides a*b? a=1, b=1; 1*1=1; 2 does not divide 1, so no.\n\n- For n=5: same; 2^2+1^2=5\na=2, b=1\nPrimes ≤√5≈2.2 are 2\n\nDoes 2 divide a*b=2*1=2? Yes.\n\nAre a and b coprime? gcd(2,1)=1. Yes.\n\nPrime 2 divides a=2. All small primes ≤√n are p=2, and p divides a.\n\nThus, 5 satisfies the condition.\n\n- For n=13: 3^2+2^2=9+4=13\na=3, b=2\n√13≈3.6, primes ≤3.6: 2 and 3\n\nCheck:\n- p=2: divides a=3? no, 2 does not divide 3, but p=2 should divide a or b? in the previous construct, the condition is that primes ≤√n divide a or b. 2 divides b=2, yes.\n\n- p=3: divides a=3? yes.\n\nYes, the condition holds for 13.\n\nSimilarly for n=17: 4^2+1^2=17\n\na=4, b=1\n\nPrimes ≤√17≈4.1: 2 and 3\n\n- p=2: divides a=4? yes.\n\n- p=3: divides a=4? no, but does p=3 divide a or b? b=1, no. \nSince p=3 divides a? no, but it doesn't divide b=1 either.\n\nWait, the condition states: \"such that if p ≤ √n, then p divides a b\". It's ambiguous whether \"p divides a b\", meaning p divides a or p divides b, or p divides the product a*b, i.e., p divides a or p divides b.\n\nIn the problem statement, \"if p ≤ √n, then p divides a b\" - that indicates p divides a*b, which means p divides either a or b or both.\n\nGiven that, in previous examples, for 17:\n\na=4, b=1:\n\n- p=2: divides a? yes. OK.\n\n- p=3: divides a? no, divides b? no.\n\nThe only primes ≤√17 are 2 and 3; 2 divides a, 3 doesn't divide a or b, but the condition only requires that p divides a or b, so the condition is satisfied as long as p divides a or b.\n\nSo, for n=17, the condition holds.\n\nSimilarly, the previous example n=13 also holds.\n\nNow, for the problem:\n\n- For n=a^2 + b^2, gcd(a, b)=1\n- For all p ≤ √n, p divides a or p divides b\n\nPossible conclusion: If all smaller primes up to √n divide either a or b, and gcd(a, b)=1, then these primes are either dividing only one of them; since gcd is 1, they can't both share any small prime factor.\n\nThis indicates that one of the numbers contains all small prime factors; the other is coprime from them.\n\nNow, since n = a^2 + b^2, and at least one of a, b is divisible by these small primes.\n\nSuppose that a contains all these small primes, then n=a^2 + b^2. Because all small primes divide a, they also divide a^2, and potentially n.\n\nSince gcd(a, b)=1 and all small primes divide a, then b is coprime to all these primes, and b has no small prime factors.\n\nGiven that, and that gcd(a, b)=1, small prime factors are entirely in a, and no small primes in b.\n\nSum-up:\n\n- a is divisible by all primes p ≤√n\n- b is coprime to all p ≤√n\n- And n=a^2 + b^2\n\nNow, since a is divisible by all primes p ≤√n, the minimal such a must be divisible by the product of all primes p ≤√n.\n\nAlso, as a^2 ≤ n, and n=a^2 + b^2, with b≥1, then a^2 < n.\n\nFrom the inequality:\n\na^2 < n = a^2 + b^2 ⇒ b^2 > 0\n\nFurthermore, as a is divisible by all small primes, the minimal a is at least the product of all primes p ≤√n, which grows very fast.\n\nIn particular, for minimal case:\n\nIf we accept the minimal scenario where a is the product of all primes p ≤√n, and b=1,\n\nthen n= a^2 + 1.\n\nSince a≥product of all p ≤√n, but more precise analysis is extremely complicated; perhaps better to check some small examples satisfying the conditions:\n\n- n=5: as above, n=1^2+2^2=1+4=5, and gcd(1,2)=1, small primes p ≤√5 are 2, p divides b=2, OK.\n\n- n=13: 13=2^2+3^2, gcd(2,3)=1, small primes p ≤√13 ≈3.6 are 2 and 3, p divides a=2 or b=3, yes.\n\n- n=25: 3^2+4^2=9+16=25, gcd(3,4)=1. small primes less than √25=5 are 2,3,5.\n\n- p=2: divides a=3? no; b=4? no; but the condition is p divides a or p divides b: 2 divides 4, OK.\n\n- p=3: divides a=3? yes; OK.\n\n- p=5: natural to check; 5 divides neither 3 nor 4. But 5 is not less than or equal to √25=5, so p=5? Yes, p=5 ≤5. Does 5 divide a or b? a=3, no; b=4, no. So at p=5, the condition fails unless p=5 is allowed? The problem states p ≤ √n, so p=5 is allowed. Therefore, 5 should divide a or b; in this case, neither is divisible by 5, so 25 does not satisfy the condition.\n\nSimilarly, for n=25, the condition fails at p=5.\n\nLet's check n=50:\n\nn=7^2+7^2=49+49=98, but gcd(7,7)=7≠1; so not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, the pattern suggests the possibilities are only for n where the small primes divide one of the numbers, and the sum of squares equals n, with the gcd=1.\n\nGiven the above, our small example solutions are:\n\n- n=5: 1^2+2^2=5, gcd=1, all primes p ≤√n=2 satisfy p divides b=2, OK.\n\n- n=13: 2^2+3^2=13, gcd=1, p=2 divides a=2.\n\n- n=17: 4^2+1^2=17, gcd=1; primes p ≤ √17≈4.1 are 2,3; 2 divides a=4, OK; 3 divides neither 4 nor 1, so fails.\n\nSimilarly, for n=25, as shown, fails.\n\nThis suggests the solutions are those where the set of small primes p divides a, with a matching the small primes up to √n, agreeing with earlier calculations.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\n- The only solutions are n where n=a^2 + b^2, gcd(a, b)=1, and all primes ≤√n divide a or b.\n\n- From the small examples, certain numbers like 5, 13, possibly 25, but the last fails at p=5.\n\n- Therefore, the solutions are n=5 and n=13, i.e., numbers of the form a^2 + b^2 with coprime a, b, and the condition holds as above.\n\n---\n\n### Final answers in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1 analysis showed that n=6 satisfies the given divisor sum condition with the largest prime divisor.
