      "A3384": "One day, there is a Street Art Show at somewhere, and there are some spectators around. We consider this place as an Euclidean plane. Let $K$ be the center of the show. And name the spectators by $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}, \\ldots$ They pick their positions $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}, \\ldots$ one by one. The positions need to satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously. (i) The distance between $K$ and $A_{n}$ is no less than 10 meters, that is, $K P_{n} \\geq 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any positive integer $n$. (ii) The distance between $A_{n}$ and any previous spectator is no less than 1 meter, that is, $P_{m} P_{n} \\geq 1 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any $n \\geq 2$ and any $1 \\leq m \\leq n-1$. (iii) $A_{n}$ always choose the position closest to $K$ that satisfies (i) and (ii), that is, $K P_{n}$ reaches its minimum possible value. If there are more than one point that satisfy (i) and (ii) and have the minimum distance to $K, A_{n}$ may choose any one of them. For example, $A_{1}$ is not restricted by (ii), so he may choose any point on the circle $C$ which is centered at $K$ with radius 10 meters. For $A_{2}$, since there are lots of points on $C$ which are at least 1 meter apart from $P_{1}$, he may choose anyone of them. (1) Which of the following statement is true? (A) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2}$ always hold (unit: meter); (B) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\sqrt{n} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} \\sqrt{n}$ always hold (unit: meter); (C) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n$ always hold (unit: meter); (D) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n^{2} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n^{2}$ always hold (unit: meter)."

Now, because they need to stay at least 1 meter apart, the points will be spaced roughly 1 meter apart on the circle or just outside it, causing the number of points around the circle to be approximately proportional to the circumference divided by 1 meter:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of points} \\sim \\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\times 10}{1}\\right) \\equiv 20\\pi \\approx 62.83\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that we can only place a finite number of points near radius 10 if they are densely packed around the circle.\n\n- **But**, since the problem involves an arbitrary number of spectators \\(n\\), how can \\(K P_n\\) grow with \\(n\\)?\n\n- The key is: spectaters are always choosing the closest possible position at radius \\(\\geq 10\\) that respects previous placement constraints.\n\n- If each subsequent point can be placed on the circle of radius 10 (or close to it), to maintain the minimum 1-meter separation, as \\(n\\) increases, they will need to be spread around the circle.\n\n- This does **not** necessarily make \\(K P_n\\) grow; since the points can be on the radius 10 circle, the minimal distance to \\(K\\) remains 10.\n\n**Implications:**\n\n- **Best case:** All points are on the circle of radius 10, so \\(K P_n =10\\) always.\n- **Largest case:** When points need to be placed further out to satisfy the 1-meter separation (e.g., if the circle is crowded), the minimal \\(K P_n\\) could be slightly larger but cannot grow proportionally with \\(n\\).\n\n- **Hence:** The minimal \\(K P_n\\) is approximately constant (around 10), and the maximum would be bounded but could be larger if the points are forced outward.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Choosing the correct statement**\n\n- The problem asks about asymptotic bounds of \\(K P_n\\) in relation to \\(n\\).\n\n- Option (A): bounded \\(c_1 \\leq K P_n \\leq c_2\\) — plausible, as points could be on the circle with radius fixed at 10.\n\n- Option (B): \\( \\propto \\sqrt{n} \\) — unlikely, since \\(K P_n\\) can be kept near 10 with strategic placement.\n\n- Option (C): \\( \\propto n \\) — unlikely unless the radius must increase linearly, but the design allows placing points on the circle of radius 10.\n\n- Option (D): \\(\\propto n^2\\) — even less plausible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the flexibility the spectators have and the constraint that they pick points as close as possible to \\(K\\), the most consistent answer is **(A)**, i.e., \\(K P_n\\) can be kept roughly constant.\n\n### **Final answer for Problem 2:**\n\n**\"A\"**\n\n---\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"In Problem 1, the recursive sequence stabilizes at x=4, which always satisfies the equation for all n, hence the solution is 4.
