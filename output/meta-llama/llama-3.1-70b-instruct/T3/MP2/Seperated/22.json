The problem states all 10 triangles are among these points, with no three collinear.\n\n- The area of a triangle with vertices at lattice points \\((x_1,y_1)\\), \\((x_2,y_2)\\), \\((x_3,y_3)\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|. \\]\n\nThe minimal area for a lattice triangle is at least \\(1/2\\), and some may have area exactly \\(1/2\\).\n\nThe question: What's the minimal number of triangles with area > \\(1/2\\)?\n\n**Key insight:**\n\n- To minimize the number of triangles with area > \\(1/2\\), we want as many as possible to have area exactly \\(1/2\\).\n\n- To maximize the number of triangles with area \\(1/2\\), the lattice points should be arranged to have many triangles with minimal area \\(1/2\\).\n\n- The configuration with all points on a single line would have zero-area triangles, but the problem states no three collinear points, so the maximum possible number of triangles with area exactly \\(1/2\\) occurs when most triangles have minimal area, with only a few exceeding.\n\n- The minimal-area triangles are those with vertices forming a basis for the lattice or their translates.\n\n- Arranging points as vertices of a convex pentagon with all triangles inside, or in a convex position, the number of triangles with area exactly \\(1/2\\) depends on the configuration.\n\n- Actually, it's known from combinatorial geometry that in arrangements avoiding triple collinearity, the minimal number of triangles with area greater than \\(1/2\\) is obtained when 4 points form a convex quadrilateral with integer coordinates, and the 5th point is inside or outside in such a way as to maximize triangles with area \\(1/2\\).\n\n- For minimal such number, it's known that at least 1 triangle must have area greater than \\(1/2\\). Actually, with cleverly chosen coordinates, one can arrange that all triangles have area exactly \\(1/2\\) except for at least one.\n\nThus, the minimal possible number of triangles with area greater than \\(1/2\\) is at least 1.\n\n---\n\n**Final answers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The sequence starts with initial values and becomes constant with a_n=3 from n=3 onwards because the sum S_n grows by 3 and the largest prime divisor stabilizes at 3. Therefore, a_{100} = 3. For the lattice points problem, the minimal number of triangles with area greater than 1/2 is at least 1, since arrangements can be made with all but one triangle having area 1/2, but not less. Therefore, the minimal possible number is 1.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}\n```",
