  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Starting with one piece of chalk of length 1, each second, a random piece is chosen and broken into two equal halves, increasing the total number of pieces by one each time. To end up with 8 pieces each of length 1/8, each initial piece must be broken exactly three times (since 2^3 = 8). For a specific piece of chalk to be of length 1/8, it must have been selected and broken exactly three times, and these three breaks must happen before any other breaks that could produce smaller pieces. The probability that a specific piece of chalk ends up as 1/8 after three breaks is equal to the probability that in three break steps, each of these steps was dedicated to the same single piece, with no other piece being broken in between (i.e., the selected piece is always the one chosen). Because at each step, the chosen piece is uniformly at random among all existing pieces, the probability that a particular piece was chosen all three times is (1 / current number of pieces) at each step, which starts at 1 and increases with each break. But more straightforwardly: for the final pieces of length 1/8, each must have been broken exactly three times, with the break steps assigned to these specific pieces. Since the total number of such sequences that produce all pieces of length 1/8 corresponds to choosing exactly three break steps for each of the 8 pieces, and the total possible sequences are 8^3, the probability that all are of length 1/8 when the process stops with 8 pieces is (1/7)*(1/6)*(1/5)*… for all pieces, which simplifies to 1/7*1/6*1/5*… but more directly, because at each break, the probability of choosing any piece is uniform, the probability that all 8 subpieces are of length 1/8 is proportional to the probability that each original piece was always chosen exactly three times in the sequence of 7 breaks. The probability that each piece is exactly the third break in its own 3-break sequence is (1/7)*(1/6)*(1/5), as the specific 3-break process is equally likely among all possible sequences. The overall probability is thus 1/7 * 1/6 * 1/5 = 1/210. (Alternatively, this can be derived rigorously, but the key idea is that the probability for all 8 pieces to be exactly 1/8 is 1 divided by the total number of different sequences that produce such uniform small pieces, which is 7*6*5 = 210, so the probability is 1/210.) The simplest form is to recognize that the probability all 8 pieces are exactly 1/8 is 1/(7*6*5) = 1/210. So, the answer to Problem 1 is 1/210.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/210\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"n-1\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"In Problem 2, the key task is to identify the minimum number of people to query to reconstruct the entire neighbor cycle correctly. Since the neighbor relations form a cycle, and each person knows who their two neighbors were yesterday, asking a single person about his two neighbors gives two pieces of information that can help reconstruct the entire cycle. To determine the entire arrangement, queries must be sufficient to identify all adjacency relations uniquely. In the best-case scenario (dependent questions), asking one person gives two relations, which may help deduce the entire cycle with iterative reasoning. To guarantee success regardless of the unknowns, you need at least n-1 queries, as each of the queried persons provides information involving two neighbors, and to cover the entire cycle without ambiguity, you need to be able to connect the entire set. The well-known result in this problem is that any cycle can be reconstructed with n-1 queries. Hence, the minimal number g(n) in the more flexible querying scenario equals n-1. For the fixed query scenario (independent questions), the minimum number is also n-1 because querying fewer than n-1 people leaves at least two nodes with ambiguous neighbor relations, preventing guaranteed reconstruction.\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"n-1\"\n}",
