This means the seating must alternate man-woman-man-woman throughout. Treat each couple as a single unit for simplicity, arranging 6 units alternately: the couples can be permuted in (6 - 1)! = 5! ways around a round table, since fixing one arrangement avoids rotational duplicates. Inside each couple, the man and woman can switch seats, so for each couple, there are 2 arrangements. Therefore, total arrangements: 5! (couples as units) * (2^6) (internal arrangements). 5! = 120, and 2^6 = 64. Final total: 120 * 64 = 7680.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"7680\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/2\"\n}",
