Ansoon starts at the first locker and always moves clockwise. When she is at locker $n$ and there are more than $n$ open lockers, she keeps locker $n$ open and closes the next $n$ open lockers, then repeats the process with the next open locker.

      "A647": "For an even integer positive integer $n$ Kevin has a tape of length $4 n$ with marks at $-2 n,-2 n+1, \\ldots, 2 n-1,2 n$. He then randomly picks $n$ points in the set $-n,-n+1,-n+2, \\ldots, n-1, n$, and places a stone on each of these points. We call a stone 'stuck' if it is on $2 n$ or $-2 n$, or either all the points to the right, or all the points to the left, all contain stones. Then, every minute, Kevin shifts the unstuck stones in the following manner: He picks an unstuck stone uniformly at random and then flips a fair coin. If the coin came up heads, he then moves that stone and every stone in the largest contiguous set containing that stone one point to the left. If the coin came up tails, he moves every stone in that set one point right instead. He repeats until all the stones are stuck. Let $p_{k}$ be the probability that at the end of the process there are exactly $k$ stones in the right half. Evaluate $$\\frac{p_{n-1}-p_{n-2}+p_{n-3}-\\ldots+p_{3}-p_{2}+p_{1}}{p_{n-1}+p_{n-2}+p_{n-3}+\\ldots+p_{3}+p_{2}+p_{1}}$$ in terms of $n$."

  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze each problem step by step.\n\n**Problem 1:**\n\n- Initial condition: N lockers, all open, labeled 1 to N, in a circle.\n- Process:\n  - Ansoo starts at locker 1, moving clockwise.\n  - At locker n:\n    - If more than n lockers are open:\n      - Keep locker n open.\n      - Close the next n open lockers.\n      - Then move to the next open locker.\n    - Else (at most n open lockers):\n      - Keep locker n open.\n      - Close all other lockers.\n\n- Continue until only one locker remains open.\n- Goal: Find the smallest N > 2021 such that the last open locker is locker 1.\n\nThis process resembles a variant of the Josephus problem with a dynamic rule: the process depends on the current position and the number of open lockers.\n\n**Key insight:**\nBecause of the symmetry and the way lockers are closed in blocks, and because the last remaining locker must be locker 1, the process effectively reduces to properties similar to the Josephus problem (where eliminations occur in a certain pattern). \n\nFrom analysis and the structure:\n- The key step is that only when the process reaches a point where only locker 1 is left open, the initial N must satisfy the corresponding Josephus position:\n  - The pattern is consistent with the Josephus problem with a step size related to the number of open lockers.\n\nTesting small N that lead to locker 1 remaining:\n- For small N, simulation or pattern recognition suggests the process is analogous to the Josephus problem with k=2 (standard), which has a known pattern.\n\n- For the standard Josephus problem with k=2, the position of the survivor is:\n  - For n in the form 2^m + l (where 0 ≤ l < 2^m),\n    - the survivor position is 2l + 1.\n- For the problem, since the last locker is 1, N must be such that the Josephus survivor is position 1, which occurs when N is a power of 2, i.e., N = 2^m for some m.\n\nTherefore:\n- The last open locker being locker 1 implies N is a power of 2.\n- The smallest power of 2 greater than 2021:\n  - 2^10 = 1024 (less than 2021)\n  - 2^11 = 2048 (greater than 2021)\n\nHence, the smallest N > 2021 such that the last locker is 1 is **2048**.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\nGiven:\n- n even positive integer.\n- Tape length: 4n, marks at -2n, ..., 2n.\n- Randomly choose n points from -n, ..., n, and place stones on these points.\n- 'Stuck' points:\n  - On endpoints: -2n or 2n, or\n  - All stones on one side (either all left or all right).\n\n- The process involves moving stones:\n  - Each step:\n    - Choose an unstuck stone uniformly.\n    - Flip a coin: move its connected set left or right by one point.\n  - Continue until all stones are stuck.\n\n- p_k: probability that at the end there are exactly k stones on the right half (-n to -1 or 1 to n, i.e., n-1, etc.).\n\n- The question: evaluate the ratio:\n  \n  (p_{n-1} - p_{n-2} + p_{n-3} - ... + p_1) / (p_{n-1} + p_{n-2} + p_{n-3} + ... + p_1).\n\n**Observation:**\n- Due to symmetry and fair random moves:\n  - Each stone has an equal chance of ending on either side.\n  - The process of moving stones is symmetric in left/right directions.\n  - The problem's terms form an alternating sum and sum over the same probabilities.\n\n- Because of the symmetric initial distribution and the symmetry of moves:\n  - The expected number of stones on either side balances out.\n  - This leads to the conclusion that the numerator (alternating sum) equals zero, because contributions cancel symmetrically.\n  - The denominator is the total probability mass over all possible k, which is 1, as probabilities sum to 1 over all possible outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the ratio simplifies to **0/1 = 0**.\n\n---\n\n**Final answers:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1 relies on the Josephus problem properties, identifying N as a power of two for the last locker to be locker 1.
