  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze each problem step by step:\n\n**Problem 1:**\nWe are given the function S(n) as the sum of the digits of n, and the equation:\nS(n)(S(n)-1) = n-1.\n\nStep 1: Notice that the left side involves S(n) and S(n)-1, which are integers related to the digit sum of n, while the right side involves n itself.\n\nStep 2: Let's suppose S(n) = s. Then the equation becomes:\ns(s-1) = n - 1, which implies:\nn = s(s-1) + 1.\n\nStep 3: Because n is a positive integer and S(n) = s, for a given n, the digit sum s must satisfy:\ns = S(n) ≤ 9 * (number of digits of n).\n\nStep 4: Since n = s(s-1) + 1, and S(n) = s, we need s to be consistent with the number of digits of n.\n\nStep 5: Test small values of s:\n\n- For s=1: n=1(0)+1=1, S(1)=1. Checks out.\n- For s=2: n=2(1)+1=3, S(3)=3 ≠ 2, discard.\n- For s=3: n=3(2)+1=7, S(7)=7 ≠ 3, discard.\n- For s=4: n=4(3)+1=13, S(13)=4, matches s=4, good.\n- For s=5: n=5(4)+1=21, S(21)=3 ≠ 5, discard.\n- For s=6: n=6(5)+1=31, S(31)=4 ≠ 6, discard.\n- For s=7: n=7(6)+1=43, S(43)=4 ≠ 7, discard.\n- For s=8: n=8(7)+1=57, S(57)=12 ≠ 8, discard.\n- For s=9: n=9(8)+1=73, S(73)=10 ≠ 9, discard.\n\nStep 6: Now check the s=4 case:\nn=13, S(13)=1+3=4, consistent. So n=13 is a solution.\n\nStep 7: For larger s, the digit sum S(n) ≤ 9 * number of digits:\n- n=57 for s=8, and S(57)=12 ≠ 8, does not match, discard.\n- n=73 for s=9, S(73)=10 ≠ 9, discard.\n\nConclusion: The only solution is n=13.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2:**\nWe choose 5 vertices of a unit cube to form a figure, and need to maximize the volume of the figure made by these points.\n\nStep 1: A cube has vertices at all 8 points of the form (x,y,z) with each coordinate 0 or 1.\n\nStep 2: To maximize the volume of the convex hull of 5 points, we seek the configuration that \"captures\" as large a volume as possible.\n\nStep 3: The maximum volume figure with 5 vertices occurs when we choose 4 vertices forming a tetrahedron with the largest possible volume, plus an additional point that increases the convex hull's volume as much as possible.\n\nStep 4: The largest volume tetrahedron within the cube is formed by four vertices that are as far apart as possible, such as (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). The volume of this tetrahedron is:\n(1/6) * |det| of vectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) which is 1/6 * 1 = 1/6.\n\nStep 5: To form a figure with 5 vertices, one approach is to include one more vertex from the cube that maximizes the convex hull's volume.\n\nStep 6: Consider choosing 4 vertices that form the maximum-volume tetrahedron, then select the vertex diagonally opposite (say, (1,1,1)).\n\nStep 7: The convex hull of these 5 points can be a larger polyhedron, but since the cube is symmetric, the maximum convex volume with 5 points will be achieved when including vertices that maximize the convex hull.\n\nStep 8: The best configuration to maximize volume is to have 4 vertices forming a tetrahedron with maximum volume (which is 1/6), and the 5th point extending the volume as much as possible.\n\nStep 9: The maximum volume obtainable with 5 vertices is when the convex hull is a pyramid with a base tetrahedron and an apex at the opposite corner, leading to a larger volume than the tetrahedron alone.\n\nStep 10: The maximum volume with 5 vertices of a cube occurs when the convex hull is a 4-simplex inscribed in the cube or a similar arrangement, but in a cube, the maximum is achieved with two adjacent vertices and the point at the opposite corner creating a triangular prism or similar shape.\n\nFrom known results, the maximum volume of such a convex figure with 5 vertices is 1/2. This occurs when five vertices include four vertices forming a face diagonally opposite, with the fifth vertex extending across the cube to form a larger convex shape.\n\n---\n\n**Final answers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, setting S(n)=s implies n=s(s-1)+1.
