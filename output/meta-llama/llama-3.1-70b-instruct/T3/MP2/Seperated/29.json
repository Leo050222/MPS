  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze both problems step by step.\n\n**Problem 1: Find all prime numbers p, q, r such that (p / q) - (4 / (r + 1)) = 1**\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation:\np/q - 4/(r+1) = 1\n\nStep 2: Rearrange:\np/q = 1 + 4/(r+1)\n\nStep 3: Express right side with common denominator:\np/q = (r+1 + 4) / (r+1) = (r + 5) / (r + 1)\n\nStep 4: Cross-multiplied:\np(r + 1) = q(r + 5)\n\nSince p, q, r are primes, p and q are prime numbers, and r is a prime number. \n\nStep 5: Note that p and q are positive primes, and r is a prime.\n\nLet's analyze possible cases:\n\n- Because p/r + 1 = (r+5)/(r+1), the right side reduces to a rational number. For p, q, r all prime, p = q(r + 5)/(r + 1). Since p and q are integers (primes), the fraction must be integral.\n\n-- Focus on p = q * (r + 5)/(r + 1).\n\n-- For p to be prime, and q prime, the fraction must be a simplified integer.\n\nStep 6: Consider potential values for r:\n- r is prime, so r ≥ 2.\n- Let's evaluate r = 2, 3, 5, 7, ... and see if p and q are prime.\n\n**Try r = 2**:\n- (r + 5) = 7, (r + 1) = 3.\n- p = q * 7/3. For p to be integer, q must be divisible by 3.\n- q is prime, and divisible by 3, so q = 3.\n- Then p = 3 * 7/3 = 7, which is prime.\n- So p=7, q=3, r=2.\n\nCheck the original equation:\np/q - 4/(r+1) = 7/3 - 4/3 = 3/3 = 1. Valid.\n\n**Try r = 3**:\n- (r + 5) = 8, (r + 1) = 4.\n- p = q * 8/4 = 2q.\n- For p prime, 2q is prime, but 2q is only prime if q=2, since 2*2=4 (not prime). q=2:\n- p=2*2=4 (not prime). So invalid.\n\n**Try r=5**:\n- (r + 5) = 10, (r+1) = 6.\n- p= q*10/6= q*5/3.\n- For p to be integer, q must be divisible by 3.\n- q=3 (prime), then p=3*5/3=5 (prime).\n- Check the original:\np/q=5/3, 4/(r+1)=4/6=2/3\np/q - 4/(r+1)=5/3 -2/3=3/3=1. Valid.\n\n**Try r=7**:\n- (r + 5)=12, (r+1)=8.\n- p=q*12/8= q*3/2.\n- For p integer, q divisible by 2.\n- q=2 (prime), then p=2*3/2=3 (prime).\n- Check original:\np/q=3/2, 4/(8)=1/2\nDifference: 3/2 - 1/2=1. Valid.\n\n**For larger r values:**\n\n- r=11:\n  (r+5)=16, (r+1)=12\n  p=q*16/12= q*4/3\n  q must be multiple of 3, q=3:\n  p=3*4/3=4 (not prime), discard.\n\n- r=13:\n  (r+5)=18, (r+1)=14\n  p= q*18/14= q*9/7\n  q must be multiple of 7, q=7:\n  p=7*9/7=9 (not prime), discard.\n\n- r=17:\n  (r+5)=22, (r+1)=18\n  p= q*22/18= q*11/9\n  q multiple of 9, but 9 is not prime, discard.\n\nFurther larger prime values will not give integer p unless q divides numerator and denominator appropriately.\n\nFrom the analysis, the solutions are:\n\n- For r=2: p=7, q=3, r=2\n- For r=5: p=5, q=3, r=5\n- For r=7: p=3, q=2, r=7\n\n**Final solutions for Problem 1:**\n\n- (p, q, r) = (7, 3, 2)\n- (p, q, r) = (5, 3, 5)\n- (p, q, r) = (3, 2, 7)\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2: Probability that after 2012 moves, FemtoPravis is at the original position on an 8x8 toroidal chessboard**\n\nStep 1: Movement in diagonals: diagonal moves change the position by (±1, ±1).\n\nStep 2: After k moves, the position change depends on the sum of move directions.\n\nStep 3: The initial position is (0,0). Let's analyze parity:\n\n- Moves are in diagonals: each move swaps the parity of both coordinate sums or keeps them constant depending on movement.\n\n- A move in a diagonal direction (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) always changes both coordinates by ±1, which affects parity:\n\nparity analysis:\n- Each move adds either (±1, ±1), which toggles parity of both coordinates.\n\n- After k moves:\n  - The parity of each coordinate is determined by the parity of the number of moves taken.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- To return to the starting position, the net movement must be (0,0).\n\n- Since each move changes the parity of both coordinates, after an even number of moves, the parity can be maintained.\n\n- For the position to be the same after 2012 moves (which is even):\n\nThe position is the same iff the sum of the moves results in no net change in position, which requires that the total number of moves in each diagonal direction balance out to net zero movement.\n\nStep 4: Known result for such random walk:\n\n- The probability that after an even number of steps, the position is back to the start on a toroidal grid is related to a binomial coefficient involving symmetric distributions. Specifically, for a symmetric random walk in two dimensions with steps of ±1 per coordinate, the probability of returning to the origin after 2n steps is:\n\nP = (Combination of steps where steps in opposite directions balance) / total possible sequences = (Number of paths that return to origin) / (total number of path sequences).\n\n- For the diagonal moves, each step can be viewed as choosing one of four directions with equal probability.\n\n- The problem reduces to counting paths with a fixed number of moves in each direction summing to zero.\n\n- Since each move has equal probability 1/4, the probability of returning to the original position after 2n steps is:\n\nP = (number of such paths) / 4^{2n}.\n\nIt is known that, for symmetric steps, the probability of returning to the origin after 2n steps in such a model is:\n\nP = C(2n, n)^2 / 4^{2n}\n\nwhere C(2n, n) is the binomial coefficient.\n\n- For n=1006 (since 2012/2=1006):\n\nP = [C(2*1006, 1006)]^2 / 4^{2012}\n\nThis is exact.\n\n**Final answer for Problem 2:**\n\nThe probability that FemtoPravis is back at the starting point after 2012 moves is:\n\nP = [C(2012, 1006)]^2 / 4^{2012}\n\n---\n\n**Final JSON output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, we algebraically manipulated the equation to identify values of r for which p and q are primes, leading to three solutions: (7, 3, 2), (5, 3, 5), and (3, 2, 7).
