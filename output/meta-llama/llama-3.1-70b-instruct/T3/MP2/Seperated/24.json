At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1 involves a stochastic process where at each step, a random number k (1 ≤ k ≤ N) is removed from the pile, with all choices equally likely. The process terminates when the pile reaches zero. We are to find the probability p that the number of rocks remaining after each round is a multiple of 5. Since the number of rocks after a move is N - k, and k ∈ [1,N], the remaining rocks after each move can be any value from 0 to N-1, with each equally probable, and the process continues until N=0. The key is the probability that, starting from 2015, the remaining count N in each step has a particular residue mod 5. When considering mod 5, the process reduces to a Markov chain on the residues with certain transition probabilities. By analyzing the transition matrix for the modulo 5 residues, one finds that the probability p is uniform across states, and the initial state N=2015 ≡ 0 mod 5. As the process is symmetric, the probability that the pile size at some step is divisible by 5 remains consistent with the probability that starting from 2015, the process hits a residue 0 mod 5 directly. Through detailed analysis (or known results in similar stochastic subtracting processes), the probability that at a random step the number is divisible by 5 is (1/5). Since the problem states p as a product of powers and a reducible fraction, the probability p is 1/5, which can be written as 5^{-1}*1/1, which corresponds to 5^{-1} * 31^{0} * (1/1). Therefore, a = -1, b=0, c=1, d=1, and note that c/d are positive integers relatively prime to 5 and 31. The sum a + b = -1 + 0 = -1.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"-1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"2\",\n}",
