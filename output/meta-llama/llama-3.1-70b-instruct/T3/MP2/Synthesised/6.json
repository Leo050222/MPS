  "math_problem": "Let $Q(x)=x^{2}+2x+3$, and suppose that $P(x)$ is a polynomial such that $P(Q(x))=x^{6}+6x^{5}+18x^{4}+32x^{3}+35x^{2}+22x+8$. Compute $P(2)$. Instead of computing $P(2)$, simply find $k = Q(r) - 1$, where $r$ is the unique real root of the derivative of $Q$. Does there exist an irrational number $\\alpha>k$ such that $\\left\\lfloor\\alpha^{n}\\right\\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod 2017)$ for all integers $n \\geq k$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's carefully analyze the problem step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the given information\n\nWe have:\n- \\(Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3\\).\n- \\(P(x)\\) is such that:\n  \\[\n  P(Q(x)) = x^6 + 6x^5 + 18x^4 + 32x^3 + 35x^2 + 22x + 8.\n  \\]\n- The goal is to compute \\(k = Q(r) - 1\\), where \\(r\\) is the **unique real root of \\(Q'(x)\\)**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find the derivative of \\(Q(x)\\)\n\n\\[\nQ'(x) = 2x + 2.\n\\]\n\nSet \\(Q'(x) = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n2x + 2 = 0 \\implies x = -1.\n\\]\n\nSince this is a linear derivative, the only critical point is \\(x = -1\\), and it is the **unique real root**.\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nr = -1.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find \\(k = Q(r) - 1\\)\n\nEvaluate \\(Q(-1)\\):\n\n\\[\nQ(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2.\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nk = Q(-1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Understand the relation \\(P(Q(x))\\)\n\nObservation: The composition \\(P(Q(x))\\) is a polynomial in \\(x\\). To find \\(P(2)\\), note that:\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3.\n\\]\n\nWe are asked, instead of \\(P(2)\\), to find \\(Q(r) - 1\\), which we have as \\(k=1\\).\n\nBut the problem also involves the mysterious part about the existence of an irrational \\(\\alpha > k\\) such that for all \\(n \\geq k\\),\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\right\\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}.\n\\]\n\nThis is a side question of a number theory flavor: whether such an \\(\\alpha\\) exists. Since \\(\\alpha\\) can be irrational and larger than an integer, the key is to check the behavior of \\(\\alpha^n \\pmod{2017}\\).\n\n**In particular**, for all \\(n \\geq k=1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\right\\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}.\n\\]\n\nThis is akin to requiring \\(\\alpha^n\\) to be very close to a multiple of 2017, for all large \\(n\\). Given the nature of exponential growth and modular behavior, such a sequence with consistent divisibility for all \\(n \\geq 1\\) is not possible with irrational \\(\\alpha\\). This resembles properties of algebraic integers or roots of unity mod a prime, but an irrational \\(\\alpha\\) cannot have the exact behavior stated for all \\(n\\).\n\n**Thus, the existence of such \\(\\alpha\\)** is **not** possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Final step: Compilation of the answer**\n\nThe primary answer requested is \\(k = 1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}\n```",
