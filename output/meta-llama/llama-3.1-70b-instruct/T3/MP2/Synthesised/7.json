  "math_problem": "You start with a single piece of chalk of length 1. Every second, you choose a piece of chalk that you have uniformly at random and break it in half. You continue this until you have 8 pieces of chalk. What is the probability that they all have length $\\frac{1}{8}$? Instead of computing the probability that all final pieces have equal length, simply find $k = \\binom{6}{3} - 16$, where $\\binom{6}{3}$ is the number of ways to interleave the remaining breaks between the two subtrees after the initial split, derived from the structural consideration of the balanced binary tree that produces uniform lengths. Yesterday, $n\\ge k$ people sat around a round table. Each participant remembers only who his two neighbours were, but not necessarily which one sat on his left and which one sat on his right. Today, you would like the same people to sit around the same round table so that each participant has the same two neighbours as yesterday (it is possible that yesterday’s left-hand side neighbour is today’s right-hand side neighbour). You are allowed to query some of the participants: if anyone is asked, he will answer by pointing at his two neighbours from yesterday.\n\na) Determine the minimal number $f(n)$ of participants you have to query in order to be certain to succeed, if later questions must not depend on the outcome of the previous questions. That is, you have to choose in advance the list of people you are going to query, before effectively asking any question.\n\nb) Determine the minimal number $g(n)$ of participants you have to query in order to be certain to succeed, if later questions may depend on the outcome of previous questions. That is, you can wait until you get the first answer to choose whom to ask the second question, and so on.",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Part 1:** The mathematical problem involves a process of breaking a chalk piece of length 1 into 8 equal pieces, with each break chosen uniformly at random from among all currently unbroken pieces. The question is about the probability that all 8 pieces are of length 1/8. The problem then defines a combinatorial quantity: \\(k = \\binom{6}{3} - 16\\).\n\n- The binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) equals \\(20\\).\n- Therefore, \\(k = 20 - 16 = 4\\).\n\nThe key points: the problem simplifies to a structural consideration involving the interleaving of remaining breaks, particularly the difference \\(k\\), which has been explicitly computed as 4.\n\n**Part 2:** The second part involves seating people around a round table and reassigning their positions given only neighbor information, with questions posed to certain participants to clarify their adjacency. The two key questions are:\n\na) The minimal number of participants \\(f(n)\\) who must be queried *beforehand*, in advance of any questioning, to guarantee success regardless of outcomes.\n\nb) The minimal number of participants \\(g(n)\\) who need to be queried *adaptively*—where subsequent questions depend on previous answers—to guarantee success.\n\nGiven the nature of the problem, this is a classic problem in combinatorial identification and symmetry resolution:\n\n- For part (a): since the person asking must design a fixed querying strategy without adapting, he needs to identify the global configuration with minimal pre-questions. Usually, in such problems, querying a small number of nodes that can distinguish the entire structure is sufficient. For a circle of \\(n\\) participants, identifying an arrangement generally requires \\(n-1\\) queries in the worst case (since knowing all but one participant's neighbors could situate the last).\n\n- For part (b): adaptive questioning allows a more efficient strategy, often requiring only a small number of queries—often just enough to \"break symmetry\" and identify the configuration exactly. Even then, in certain symmetric structures, it may take as few as 2 or 3 questions.\n\nBased on standard results in similar neighbor-identification problems:\n\n- The worst-case fixed pre-query number \\(f(n)\\) ≈ \\(n-1\\) (since you need to determine the entire arrangement).\n- The adaptive querying \\(g(n)\\) can often be as low as 2, assuming the problem admits such a strategy.\n\n**Final step:** The problem asks for the computed value in JSON format, specifically for the variable \"answer\" with no additional commentary.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"4\"\n}\n```",
