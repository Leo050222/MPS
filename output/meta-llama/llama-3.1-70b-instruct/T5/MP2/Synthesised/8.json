But \\(f(1) \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), so it can be any positive integer except possibly some.\n\nNow, the division condition:\n\n\\[ 2f(1) -1 \\mid 1 \\times f(1) + 1 \\times f(1) = 2f(1). \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 2f(1) - 1 \\mid 2 f(1). \\]\n\n**Step 2: Express \\(f(1)\\) in terms of \\(\\kappa\\):**\n\n\\[f(1) = \\kappa + 1.\\]\n\nWe are asked to find \\(\\kappa\\).\n\n**Step 3: The divisibility condition at \\(m=n=1\\):**\n\n\\[ 2f(1) -1 \\mid 2f(1) \\]\n\\[ 2(\\kappa + 1) - 1 \\mid 2(\\kappa + 1) \\]\n\\[ 2\\kappa + 2 - 1 = 2\\kappa + 1. \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 2\\kappa + 1 \\mid 2\\kappa + 2. \\]\n\nSince \\(2\\kappa + 1\\) divides \\(2\\kappa + 2\\), the division yields:\n\n\\[\n2\\kappa + 2 = k (2\\kappa + 1), \\text{ for some integer } k.\n\\]\n\nWe check if \\(2\\kappa + 1\\) divides \\(2\\kappa + 2\\):\n\n\\[\n2\\kappa + 2 = (2\\kappa + 1) + 1.\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n(2\\kappa + 1) \\mid 1,\n\\]\n\nwhich implies that \\(2\\kappa + 1 \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}\\), because only divisors of 1 and -1 are ±1.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n2 \\kappa + 1 = \\pm 1.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\(\\kappa\\):**\n\n1.

If \\(2\\kappa + 1 = -1\\), then \\(\\kappa = -1\\).\n\n---\n\nHence, the only possible values are \\(\\kappa = 0\\) or \\(\\kappa = -1\\).\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: Verifying the possibility of such \\(\\kappa\\) values**\n\nThe problem asks: for these \\(\\kappa\\), do there exist functions \\(f\\) satisfying the full set of conditions?\n\nIn particular, we need to check if the problem is consistent for these two main candidate values.\n\n---\n\n**Part 3: Sketching candidate functions**\n\n- For \\(\\kappa = 0\\), then \\(f(1)=1\\).\n\n- For \\(\\kappa = -1\\), then \\(f(1)=0\\).\n\nBut \\(f:\\mathbb{N}\\to \\mathbb{N}\\), and \\(f(1)\\) must be positive, so \\(f(1)=0\\) is impossible because 0 is not in \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). Therefore,\n\n**\\(\\kappa = -1\\) is invalid because it yields \\(f(1)=0\\).**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only feasible \\(\\kappa\\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).\n\n---\n\n**Part 4: Addressing the sequence \\(F(n)\\)**\n\nThe problem then transitions to the set of conditions (a), (b), (c) for the sequence \\(F(n)\\), which involve \\(\\kappa\\), which we've found to be 0.\n\n- Condition (a): Contains all integers \\(\\geq \\kappa=0\\). That is all nonnegative integers.\n\n- Condition (b): For every \\(\\ell\\ge 0\\) and \\(M \\ge 0\\), there exists \\(n > M\\) with \\(F(n) = \\ell\\). This is essentially that the sequence is \"cofinal\" in all non-negative integers.\n\n- Condition (c): The functional-type recursive relation:\n\n\\[\nF(F(n^{163})) = F(F(n)) + F(F(361))\n\\]\n\nfor all \\( n \\ge 2 \\).\n\nThe question: does such a sequence exist satisfying these conditions?\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Constructing such a sequence**\n\n- Since all integers \\(\\geq 0\\) must appear, and for large enough \\(n\\), the sequence must attain every value \\(\\ell \\geq 0\\), the sequence must be *dense enough* in non-negative integers.\n\n- Condition (c) relates iterated compositions of \\(F\\) evaluated at some polynomial functions of \\(n\\).\n\n- Because the sequence covers all \\(\\geq 0\\), and the relation involves compositions, a simple candidate could be a constant sequence:\n\n\\[\nF(n) = 0, \\quad \\forall n \\ge 1.\n\\]\n  \nCheck the conditions:\n\n- (a): true; all \\(\\geq 0\\).\n\n- (b): for any \\(\\ell \\ge 0\\), since \\(F(n)=0\\) for all \\(n\\), the sequence only takes value 0, so condition (b) fails unless we interpret it differently.\n\n- Alternatively, consider \\(F(n)=n-1\\). For \\(n \\ge 2\\):\n\n\\[\nF(n) = n-1 \\ge 1.\n\\]\n\nBut then, it only takes positive integers, so it does not include 0.\n\nAlternatively, a sequence enumerating all nonnegative integers in a way satisfying (b) and (a) would need to be carefully constructed.\n\n- As for (c), the functional equation:\n\n\\[\nF(F(n^{163})) = F(F(n)) + F(F(361))\n\\]\n\nimposes a strong constraint that resembles a linear functional equation on the sequence.\n\nSuppose \\(F(n)\\) is linear: \\(F(n) = an + b\\).\n\nPlug into (c):\n\n\\[\nF(F(n^{163})) = F(F(n)) + F(F(361))\n\\]\n\nwhich expands as:\n\n- \\(F(n) = a n + b\\)\n\n- \\(F(F(n^{163})) = a (a n^{163} + b) + b = a^2 n^{163} + a b + b\\).\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[\nF(F(n)) = a (a n + b) + b = a^2 n + a b + b,\n\\]\nand\n\n\\[\nF(F(361)) = a (a \\times 361 + b) + b = a^2 \\times 361 + a b + b.\n\\]\n\nPlug into (c):\n\n\\[\na^2 n^{163} + a b + b = a^2 n + a b + b + a^2 \\times 361 + a b + b.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\na^2 n^{163} = a^2 n + a^2 \\times 361 + (a b + b) - (a b + b),\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\na^2 n^{163} = a^2 n + a^2 \\times 361.\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(a^2\\):\n\n\\[\nn^{163} = n + 361.\n\\]\n\nBut this is false for arbitrary large \\(n\\), so the linear ansatz can't satisfy the functional equation unless the polynomial degree matches the structure identically, which is impossible here.\n\nHence, the sequence cannot be linear.\n\nGiven the structure, it's complicated to explicitly construct such a sequence, but the key is whether such a sequence exists at all.\n\nBecause (a) and (b) impose coverage of all integers \\(\\geq 0\\) and their infinite occurrence after any large \\(M\\), and (c) connects iterates of \\(F\\) evaluated at polynomial arguments, it's conceivable that such a sequence does exist (e.g., some constructed sequence with translates and iteration properties, perhaps based on factorials or recursive definitions), given the flexibility in (a) and (b).\n\n**Final step: Address the question**\n\nThe question specifically asks: *\"Does there exist such a sequence?\"* given the conditions that \\(\\kappa = 0\\).\n\nBased on the above, and under the assumption that the problem expects to confirm existence or nonexistence:\n\n- Since creating such sequences with arbitrary properties isn't strictly impossible, and the conditions are consistent given the fullness in coverage and some recursive property, the logical answer is **\"Yes\"**.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
