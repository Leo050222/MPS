Thus:\n     \\[f(c) = 0.\\]\n\n3. **Check the case \\(x=1\\):**\n   \\[f(y + f(1)) = f(1 + y) = 1 \\cdot f(1 + y) \\Rightarrow \\text{always holds},\\]\n   giving no new info.\n\n4. **Check the case \\(x=-1\\):**\n   \\[f(-y + f(1)) = -1 \\cdot f(-1 + y) = -f(-1 + y).\\]\n   But this is symmetrical and not immediately conclusive, so move on.\n\n5. **Attempt to find potential solutions:**\n\n   - Test linear solutions: assume \\(f(x) = kx + d\\).\n\n   - Substitute into the original:\n\n     \\[f(xy + f(x^2)) = f(xy + kx^2 + d) = k(y x + x^2 k + d) + d.\\]\n     \\[x f(x + y) = x (k(x + y) + d) = x (k x + k y + d) = k x^2 + k x y + d x.\\]\n\n   Equate both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   k (y x + k x^2 + d) + d = k x^2 + k x y + d x.\n   \\]\n\n   Expand the left side:\n\n   \\[\n   k y x + k^2 x^2 + k d + d = k x^2 + k x y + d x.\n   \\]\n\n   Comparing coefficients:\n\n   - For \\(x y\\): \\(k y x\\) on both sides, matching.\n   - For \\(x^2\\): \\(k^2 x^2 = k x^2 \\Rightarrow k^2 = k \\Rightarrow k=0 \\text{ or } 1.\\)\n   - For constants: \\(k d + d = 0 \\Rightarrow d (k + 1) = 0.\\)\n\n   **Case 1:** \\(k=0\\):\n   - Then \\(f(x) = d\\) constant.\n   - Inserting into equation:\n\n     \\(f(x y + c) = c\\),\n     \\[f(x y + c) = c,\\]\n     \\[x f(x + y) = x c.\\]\n     Equate:\n\n     \\[c = x c \\Rightarrow c(1 - x) = 0 \\text{ for all } x\\]\n     - Only possible if \\(c=0\\).\n\n   So one solution is **constant zero function**:\n\n   \\[\n   f(x)=0.\n   \\]\n\n   **Case 2:** \\(k=1\\):\n   - Then \\(f(x) = x + d\\),\n   - Condition \\(d (1 + 1)= 0 \\Rightarrow 2d=0 \\Rightarrow d=0\\).\n\n   So \\(f(x)=x\\).\n\n6. **Check solutions:**\n\n   - **Solution 1:** \\(f(x)=0\\):\n     \\[f(x y + f(x^2))=f(x y+0)=0,\\]\n     RHS: \\(x f(x + y) = x \\cdot 0=0\\), consistent.\n\n   - **Solution 2:** \\(f(x)=x\\):\n     \\[f(x y + (x^2))= x y + x^2,\\]\n     RHS: \\(x f(x + y) = x (x + y)=x^2 + x y\\),\n     equality holds.\n\n7. **Are there other solutions?**\n\n   - The non-linear function options seem unlikely from previous steps.\n\n   - Let's verify any potential functions for irregular behaviors by substitution.\n\n   - From the general reasoning, the only solutions are the linear, consistent, and we've checked constant zero and identity.\n\n**Conclusion for Problem 1:**\n\n\\[f(x)=0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(x)=x\\]\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2: Determine all positive integers relatively prime to all the terms of**\n\n\\[a_n=2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1, \\quad n\\geq 1.\\]\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Express \\(a_n\\) in terms of factors:**\n\n   - Note that \\(6^n = (2 \\cdot 3)^n = 2^n 3^n\\).\n\n2. **Check divisibility by small primes:**\n\n   - For \\(a_n\\), check prime divisibility.\n\n3. **Observation about 2:**\n\n   - \\(a_n \\equiv 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 \\pmod{2}\\):\n\n     \\(2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\\) for \\(n \\geq 1\\),\n\n     \\(3^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}\\),\n\n     \\(6^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\\),\n\n     sum: \\(0 + 1 + 0 =1\\);\r\n\r\n     minus 1: \\(0\\). So:\n\n     \\[a_n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}.\\]\n\n     So \\(2\\) divides \\(a_n\\) for all \\(n\\).\n\n4. **Check divisibility by 3:**\n\n   \\(a_n \\equiv 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 \\pmod{3}\\):\n\n   \\(2^n \\pmod{3}\\):\n\n   - \\(2^1=2\\),\n   - \\(2^2=4 \\equiv 1\\),\n   - \\(2^3=2\\),\n   - \\(2^4=1\\),\n   pattern: alternates between 2 and 1.\n\n   \\(3^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\n   \\(6^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\n   Compute:\n\n   For odd \\(n\\):\n\n   \\[\n   2^n \\equiv 2, \\quad 3^n \\equiv 0, \\quad 6^n \\equiv 0, \\quad a_n \\equiv 2 + 0 + 0 -1 = 1 \\not\\equiv 0.\n   \\]\n\n   For even \\(n\\):\n\n   \\[\n   2^n \\equiv 1, \\quad 3^n \\equiv 0, \\quad 6^n \\equiv 0, \\quad a_n \\equiv 1 + 0 + 0 - 1= 0.\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore:\n\n   - \\(a_n\\) divisible by 3 **only when \\(n\\) is even**.\n\n   **Conclusion:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{For } n\\text{ even}, a_n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}.\n   \\]\n\n   - For odd \\(n\\), \\(a_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), so 3 does not divide \\(a_n\\).\n\n5. **Summary of divisibility:**\n\n   - 2 divides **all** \\(a_n\\).\n\n   - 3 divides **even** \\(a_n\\).\n\n6. **Are there other primes dividing all \\(a_n\\)?**\n\n   Let's check if there's a prime dividing all \\(a_n\\):\n\n   - For \\(n=1\\):\n\n     \\[\n     a_1=2^1 + 3^1 + 6^1 -1= 2+3+6 -1= 10.\n     \\]\n\n     Factors: 2 and 5.\n\n   Since 10 is divisible by 2 and 5, both are potential candidates.\n\n   Is 5 dividing all \\(a_n\\)? Check \\(a_2\\):\n\n   \\[\n   a_2= 4 + 9 + 36 -1=48,\n   \\]\n\n   divisible by 6 but not 5. So 5 does not always divide.\n\n   How about prime 2? Yes, because:\n\n   \\[\n   a_1=10, \\quad a_2=48,\n   \\]\n\n   both divisible by 2. Check \\(a_3\\):\n\n   \\[\n   8 + 27 + 216 -1= 250,\n   \\]\n\ndivisible by 2. All \\(a_n\\) are even (\\(a_n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\\)).\n\n7. **Summary:**\n\n   - All \\(a_n\\) are divisible by 2.\n\n   - For odd \\(n\\), \\(a_n\\) are not necessarily divisible by 3; only for even \\(n\\).\n\n8. **Primes relatively prime to all \\(a_n\\):**\n\n   Since all \\(a_n\\) are divisible by 2, any prime not dividing 2 (i.e., odd primes) may or may not divide some \\(a_n\\), but the problem asks for positive integers that are **relatively prime to ALL** \\(a_n\\).  \n\n   - Clearly, 2 divides all \\(a_n\\), so 2 is **not** coprime to all \\(a_n\\).\n\n   - Any odd prime \\(p\\neq 2\\): \n\n     The sequence has terms divisible by 2, but not necessarily by \\(p\\). Also, we're to find positive integers coprime to all \\(a_n\\), i.e., numbers that do **not** share any prime factor with **any** of the \\(a_n\\).\n\n   - The only candidate for being **coprime to all** is 1, because:\n\n     - All \\(a_n\\) are even, so any number greater than 1 must have a prime factor, and some \\(a_n\\) are not divisible by that prime.\n\n   But, wait: the question is: \"Determine all positive integers relatively prime to all the terms of the sequence.\" That means, positive integers \\(m\\) such that \\(\\gcd(m,a_n)=1\\) for all \\(n\\).\n\n   Since \\(a_n\\) is divisible by 2 for all \\(n\\), any such \\(m\\) cannot be divisible by 2; they must be odd.\n\n   But for \\(m\\) odd, is that possible?\n\n   - The sequence contains terms \\(a_{n}\\) divisible by 2 but sometimes not divisible by other primes beyond 2.\n\n   - Consider \\(m=1\\):\n\n     \\(\\gcd(1,a_n)=1\\) always.\n\n   - For \\(m= p\\) prime:\n\n     - \\(p\\) divides \\(a_n\\) for some \\(n\\), when that \\(a_n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\\). For example, for \\(p=3\\):\n\n       - \\(a_{n}\\) divisible by 3 for even \\(n\\).\n\n     So, \\(p=3\\) divides some \\(a_n\\), thus \\(\\gcd(p,a_{n})\\neq 1\\) for that \\(a_n\\). So \\(p=3\\) cannot be coprime to all \\(a_n\\).\n\n     - Similarly for any odd prime \\(p\\), since the sequence varies, it's not necessarily divisible by \\(p\\). We need that \\(p\\) does not divide **any** \\(a_n\\).\n\n   - Now, the sequence for different \\(n\\) is not always divisible by the same prime (except 2). So, the only positive integer coprime with all \\(a_n\\) is \\(1\\).\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\n- The only positive integer coprime to **all** the terms is \\(1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final answers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, the functional equation suggests linear solutions; testing these yields solutions f(x)=0 and f(x)=x.
