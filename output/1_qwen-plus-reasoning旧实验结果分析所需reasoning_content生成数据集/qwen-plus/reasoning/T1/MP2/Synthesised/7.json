  "math_problem": "What is the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region if a circular spinner is divided into six regions, four regions each have a central angle of $x^{\\circ}$, and the remaining regions have central angles of $20^{\\circ}$ and $140^{\\circ}$, where the shaded regions consist of the $140^{\\circ}$ region and two of the $x^{\\circ}$ regions? Instead of computing the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region, simply find $N = \\theta + 2700$, where $\\theta$ is the total central angle in degrees of the shaded regions. We call the pair $(m, n)$ of positive integers a happy pair if the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is a perfect square. For example, $(20, 24)$ is a happy pair because the greatest common divisor of 20 and 24 is 4. Suppose that $k$ is a positive integer such that $(205800, 35k)$ is a happy pair. What is the number of possible values of $k$ with $k \\leq N$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the value of $ x $ for the spinner. The total central angle is $ 360^\\\\circ $, so $ 4x + 20 + 140 = 360 $. Solving gives $ 4x = 200 $, so $ x = 50 $. The shaded regions consist of the $ 140^\\\\circ $ region and two $ x^\\\\circ $ regions, so the total shaded angle $ \\\\theta = 140 + 2 \\\\times 50 = 240^\\\\circ $. Thus, $ N = \\\\theta + 2700 = 240 + 2700 = 2940 $.\\n\\nNext, analyze the happy pair condition for $ (205800, 35k) $. Factorize $ 205800 = 2^3 \\\\times 3^1 \\\\times 5^2 \\\\times 7^3 $ and $ 35k = 5 \\\\times 7 \\\\times k $. The gcd must be a perfect square, so exponents in the gcd must be even:\\n- For prime 2: $ \\\\min(3, a) $ must be even $ \\\\Rightarrow a = 0 $ or $ 2 $.\\n- For prime 3: $ \\\\min(1, b) $ must be even $ \\\\Rightarrow b = 0 $.\\n- For prime 5: $ \\\\min(2, c+1) $ must be even $ \\\\Rightarrow c \\\\geq 1 $.\\n- For prime 7: $ \\\\min(3, d+1) $ must be even $ \\\\Rightarrow d = 1 $.\\n\\nLet $ k = 2^a \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7 \\\\times t $, where $ t $ is coprime to $ 210 $ (i.e., $ \\\\gcd(t, 210) = 1 $).
