  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The spinner has six regions: four with central angle $x^\\\\circ$, one with $20^\\\\circ$, and one with $140^\\\\circ$. The total central angle of a circle is $360^\\\\circ$, so $4x + 20 + 140 = 360$. Solving gives $4x = 200 \\\\implies x = 50$. Assuming the shaded regions are the four $x^\\\\circ$ regions (as the problem implies finding $\\\\theta$ without specifying shaded regions, and standard problems often shade the variable regions), $\\\\theta = 4 \\\\times 50 = 200$. Thus, $N = \\\\theta + 2700 = 200 + 2700 = 2900$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Factorize $205800 = 2^3 \\\\cdot 3^1 \\\\cdot 5^2 \\\\cdot 7^3$ and $35 = 5 \\\\cdot 7$. For $\\\\gcd(205800, 35k)$ to be a perfect square, exponents in the gcd must be even. Analyzing each prime:\\n- Prime 2: $\\\\min(3, a)$ must be even $\\\\implies a = 0$ or $2$.\\n- Prime 3: $\\\\min(1, b)$ must be even $\\\\implies b = 0$.\\n- Prime 5: $\\\\min(2, c+1)$ must be even $\\\\implies c \\\\geq 1$.\\n- Prime 7: $\\\\min(3, d+1)$ must be even $\\\\implies d = 1$.\\n- Other primes in $k$ (coprime to 210) do not affect the gcd (exponent 0, even).\\n\\nExpress $k = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot m$ with $m$ coprime to 210. For $k \\\\leq 2940$, solve $2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 420$ (since $35k = 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot k$ and $205800$ constraints). \\n- Case $a=0$: $5^c \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 420$.
