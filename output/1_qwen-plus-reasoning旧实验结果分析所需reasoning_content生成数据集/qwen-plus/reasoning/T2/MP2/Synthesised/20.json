  "math_problem": "Find all positive integers $n$ such that: \n\\[\n\\dfrac{n^3+3}{n^2+7}\n\\]\nis a positive integer. Instead of finding all positive integers making the given rational expression a positive integer, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the positive integer such that for each such positive integer, it equals the value of the expression plus $k$. Find all the values of $m$ for which the zeros of $2 x^{2}-m x-8$ differ by $|m - k|$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find positive integers $ n $ such that $ \\\\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7} $ is a positive integer. Perform polynomial division: $ \\\\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7} = n - \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $. For the expression to be an integer, $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $ must be a positive integer. Testing small $ n $ values (since $ n^2 + 7 > 7n - 3 $ for $ n \\\\geq 6 $), valid $ n $ are 2 and 5. For $ n = 2 $, the expression value is 1; for $ n = 5 $, it is 4. Thus, $ k = n - \\\\text{expression value} = 1 $ in both cases.\\n\\nNext, find $ m $ such that the zeros of $ 2x^2 - mx - 8 $ differ by $ |m - k| = |m - 1| $. The difference of zeros is $ \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{m^2 + 64}}{2} $. Setting this equal to $ |m - 1| $:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{m^2 + 64}}{2} = |m - 1| \\\\implies \\\\sqrt{m^2 + 64} = 2|m - 1| \\\\implies m^2 + 64 = 4(m - 1)^2\\n$$\\nSolving $ 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0 $ gives $ m = 6 $ and $ m = -\\\\frac{10}{3} $. Both satisfy the original equation.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6, -10/3\"\n}",
