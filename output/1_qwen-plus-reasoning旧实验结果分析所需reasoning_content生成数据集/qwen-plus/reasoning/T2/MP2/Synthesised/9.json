  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Instead of determining the number of partitions of the set into pairs that form a single cell, simply find $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game. What is the probability that exactly $k$ games will need to be played to determine a winner?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires determining the probability that exactly $ k $ games are played in a best-of-9 series where the first team to win 5 games wins. First, we analyze the consistent 2-configuration part: a 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of one pair, meaning the set $ A $ must have $ n = 2 $ elements (since a single pair partitions $ A $). Thus, $ k = n + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7 $. \\n\\nFor the best-of-9 series, the series ends at exactly 7 games if one team wins the 7th game and has exactly 4 wins in the first 6 games.
