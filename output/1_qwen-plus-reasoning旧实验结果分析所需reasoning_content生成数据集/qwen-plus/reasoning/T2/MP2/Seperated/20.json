  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To find positive integers $n$ such that $\\\\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7}$ is a positive integer, we perform polynomial division: $n^3 + 3 = n(n^2 + 7) - 7n + 3$. Thus, the expression simplifies to $n - \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7}$. For this to be an integer, $n^2 + 7$ must divide $7n - 3$. Since $n^2 + 7 > 0$, we require $n^2 + 7 \\\\leq |7n - 3|$. Solving $n^2 - 7n + 10 \\\\leq 0$ gives $2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 5$. Testing $n = 2, 3, 4, 5$: only $n = 2$ (yields 1) and $n = 5$ (yields 4) work. For each valid $n$, $k = n - \\\\text{expression value}$. Both give $k = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let roots be $\\\\alpha, \\\\beta$. Sum $\\\\alpha + \\\\beta = \\\\frac{m}{2}$, product $\\\\alpha\\\\beta = -4$. Given $|\\\\alpha - \\\\beta| = m - 1$, we use $(\\\\alpha - \\\\beta)^2 = (\\\\alpha + \\\\beta)^2 - 4\\\\alpha\\\\beta$. Substituting: $(m - 1)^2 = \\\\left(\\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\right)^2 + 16$. Solving $3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0$ gives $m = 6$ and $m = -\\\\frac{10}{3}$. Since $|\\\\alpha - \\\\beta| \\\\geq 0$, $m - 1 \\\\geq 0 \\\\implies m \\\\geq 1$. Only $m = 6$ is valid.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
