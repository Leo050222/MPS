  "math_problem": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form. Determine all the roots, real or complex, of the system of simultaneous equations $x + y + z = m$, $x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = m$, $x^{m} + y^{m} + z^{m} = m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, we analyze the probability $ p $ that the number of rocks left after each round is a multiple of 5. Starting with 2015 rocks (which is $ 5 \\\\times 403 $), we define $ g(t) $ as the probability starting from $ 5t $ rocks. Using recurrence relations, we find $ g(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{k=0}^{t-1} (5k + 1)}{5^t t!} $. For $ t = 403 $, we compute the exponent of 31 in $ p = g(403) $. The numerator's product includes terms divisible by 31 (13 terms) and one term divisible by $ 31^2 $, giving a total exponent of 14. The denominator $ 403! $ has an exponent of 13 for 31. Thus, $ b = 14 - 13 = 1 $, so $ m = b + 2 = 3 $. Solving the system $ x + y + z = 3 $, $ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3 $, $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 $, we find the elementary symmetric sums lead to the polynomial $ (t - 1)^3 $, so all roots are 1, 1, 1.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1, 1, 1\"\n}",
