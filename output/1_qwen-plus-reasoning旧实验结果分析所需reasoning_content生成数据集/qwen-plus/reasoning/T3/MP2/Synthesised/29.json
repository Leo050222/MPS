  "math_problem": "Find all prime numbers $p,q,r$ , such that $\\frac{p}{q}-\\frac{4}{r+1}=1$ Instead of finding all prime numbers $p,q,r$ satisfying the given equation, simply find $n = r + 2009$, where $r$ is the prime number such that $r + 1$ equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term. FemtoPravis is walking on an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard that wraps around at its edges (so squares on the left edge of the chessboard are adjacent to squares on the right edge, and similarly for the top and bottom edges). Each femtosecond, FemtoPravis moves in one of the four diagonal directions uniformly at random. After $n$ femtoseconds, what is the probability that FemtoPravis is at his original location?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding $ n = r + 2009 $, where $ r $ is a prime such that $ r + 1 $ equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term $ \\\\frac{4}{r+1} $. The numerator of this term is always 4, so $ r + 1 = 4 $, giving $ r = 3 $ (a prime). Thus, $ n = 3 + 2009 = 2012 $.\\n\\nNext, consider FemtoPravis moving on an $ 8 \\\\times 8 $ toroidal chessboard. Each move changes coordinates by $ (\\\\pm1, \\\\pm1) $, so after $ n = 2012 $ steps (even), the position must have both coordinates even. The walk is confined to a $ 4 \\\\times 4 $ sublattice of even positions. As $ n $ is large, the probability distribution converges to uniform over the 16 reachable positions. Hence, the probability of being at the origin is $ \\\\frac{1}{16} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/16\"\n}",
