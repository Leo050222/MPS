  "math_problem": "Find all the pairs $(m, n)$ of integers which satisfy the equation \\[m^5 - n^5 = 16mn.\\] Instead of determining all integer solutions to the Diophantine equation, simply find $k = n - 1$, where $n$ is the positive integer appearing in the solution pair with variables of opposite signs. Suppose $x^{3}-a x^{2}+b x-48$ is a polynomial with three positive roots $p, q$, and $r$ such that $p<q<r$. What is the minimum possible value of $k / p+2 / q+3 / r$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the Diophantine equation $m^5 - n^5 = 16mn$ for integer pairs $(m, n)$ with opposite signs. Assume $m = -a$ (negative) and $n > 0$. Substituting gives $a^5 + n^5 = 16an$. Testing small positive integers, $a = 2$ and $n = 2$ satisfy the equation: $2^5 + 2^5 = 32 + 32 = 64 = 16 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 2$. Thus, $(m, n) = (-2, 2)$ is a solution with opposite signs, where $n = 2$ is positive. Hence, $k = n - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nNext, consider the polynomial $x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48$ with positive roots $p < q < r$. By Vieta's formulas, $pqr = 48$. We minimize $\\\\frac{k}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r} = \\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$.\\n\\nTesting integer root triples $(p, q, r)$ with $pqr = 48$:\\n- $(2, 4, 6)$: $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3}{2}$.\\n\\nUsing Lagrange multipliers, the minimum occurs when $q = 2p$ and $r = 3p$, leading to $p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$ (since $pqr = 48$). This confirms the minimum value is $\\\\frac{3}{2}$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3/2\"\n}",
