  "math_problem": "For a given positive integer $n$, we define $\\varphi(n)$ to be the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ which share no common prime factors with $n$. Find all positive integers $n$ for which $\\varphi(2019 n)=\\varphi\\left(n^{2}\\right)$. Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ for which $\\varphi(2019 n)=\\varphi(n^2)$, simply find $k=\\gcd(2019,n)-2018$, where $n$ is the positive integer solution that is a multiple of $2019$. The sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$ of real numbers satisfies the recurrence $a_{n+1}=\\frac{a_{n}^{2}-a_{n-1}+2 a_{n}}{a_{n-1}+k}$. Given that $a_{1}=k$ and $a_{9}=7$, find $a_{5}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, factorize 2019 as 3 × 673 (both primes). For n to be a multiple of 2019, let n = 2019m. The equation φ(2019n) = φ(n²) requires analyzing prime exponents. Let n = 3^a × 673^b × k (k coprime to 2019). Since n is a multiple of 2019, a ≥ 1, b ≥ 1. Using φ properties, equating φ(2019n) and φ(n²) leads to constraints on exponents: a = 1, b = 1, and k = 1 (the coprime part). Thus, n = 2019 is the only solution. Then gcd(2019, n) = 2019, so k = 2019 - 2018 = 1.\\n\\nNext, the recurrence a_{n+1} = (a_n² - a_{n-1} + 2a_n)/(a_{n-1} + 1) with a₁ = 1 and a₉ = 7. Substitute b_n = a_n + 1, transforming the recurrence to b_{n+1} = b_n² / b_{n-1}, a geometric-like sequence. With b₁ = 2, b₉ = 8, solving gives b₅ = 4, so a₅ = 3.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
