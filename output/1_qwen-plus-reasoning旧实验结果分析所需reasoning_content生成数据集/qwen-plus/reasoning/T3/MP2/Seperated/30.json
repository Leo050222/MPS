Factorizing 2019 as $ 3 \\\\times 673 $, we analyze $ \\\\varphi(2019n) = \\\\varphi(n^2) $. Using properties of Euler's totient function, we derive that $ n $ must be exactly 2019 (since higher exponents or additional prime factors violate the equality). Thus, $ \\\\gcd(2019, n) = 2019 $, so $ k = 2019 - 2018 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Substituting $ b_n = a_n + 1 $ transforms the recurrence into $ b_{n+1} = \\\\frac{b_n^2}{b_{n-1}} $, indicating a geometric sequence. With $ b_1 = 2 $ and $ b_9 = 8 $, solving $ b_9 = \\\\frac{c^8}{128} = 8 $ gives $ c^4 = 32 $.
