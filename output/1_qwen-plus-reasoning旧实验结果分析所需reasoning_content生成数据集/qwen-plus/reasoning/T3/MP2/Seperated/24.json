      "A1098": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability $ p $ that the number of rocks left after each round is a multiple of 5 is analyzed by modeling the process as a recurrence relation. Starting with $ 2015 = 5 \\\\times 403 $, the key insight is that at each step with $ 5m $ rocks, the probability of choosing a valid $ k $ (a multiple of 5) is $ \\\\frac{1}{5} $, but the exact probability depends on the product of terms involving $ 5k + 1 $. Using prime factorization analysis, the exponent of 31 in the numerator (product of $ 5k + 1 $ for $ k = 1 $ to $ 402 $) is 14, and in the denominator (factorial $ 403! $) is 13. Thus, the exponent $ b $ of 31 in $ p $ is $ 14 - 13 = 1 $. The problem asks for $ m = b + 2 $, so $ m = 3 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The system $ x + y + z = 3 $ and $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 $ is solved using algebraic identities. By substituting into the identity $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) $, we find that solutions must satisfy $ xyz = 3(xy + yz + zx) - 8 $. Analyzing cases where variables are equal or two are equal, the only solutions are the triple $ (1, 1, 1) $ and all permutations of $ (4, 4, -5) $. These are verified to satisfy both equations, and no other solutions with repeated variables exist. Complex solutions with distinct variables exist but are parameterized; however, the problem likely expects the explicit symmetric solutions.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(1,1,1), (4,4,-5), (4,-5,4), (-5,4,4)\"\n}",
