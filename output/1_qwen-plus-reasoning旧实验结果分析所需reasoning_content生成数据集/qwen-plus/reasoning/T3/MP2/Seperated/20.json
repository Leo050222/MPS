Assuming $m < 0$ and $n > 0$, let $m = -a$ ($a > 0$), leading to $a^5 + n^5 = 16an$. Testing small values, we find $a = 2$, $n = 2$ satisfies the equation, giving $m = -2$, $n = 2$. This is the only solution with opposite signs. Thus, $k = n - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given polynomial $x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48$ with roots $p < q < r$, we have $pqr = 48$. To minimize $\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$, we use Lagrange multipliers or test integer factorizations. The critical point occurs at $p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$, yielding $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{3}{2}$. This is confirmed as the minimum via optimization and testing other factorizations.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
