Setting $ x = 0 $ gives $ f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)| $. Testing constant functions shows $ f(x) = 0 $ is a solution, but further analysis reveals all solutions must be linear $ f(x) = c x $ with $ c \\\\geq 0 $. Substituting into the equation confirms $ f(0) = 0 $ for all valid $ c $. Thus, $ k = 0 + 4 = 4 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize the number of circles through 4 concyclic points among 7 arbitrary points, note that each circle with $ m \\\\geq 4 $ points contributes $ \\\\binom{m}{3} $ triples. The total number of triples from 7 points is $ \\\\binom{7}{3} = 35 $. For circles with exactly 4 points, each contributes 4 triples. Using combinatorial bounds, the maximum number of such circles is constrained by pair intersections: each pair of points can lie on at most 2 circles (since 2 circles intersect in at most 2 points). This leads to $ 6t \\\\leq 42 $ (where $ t $ is the number of circles), giving $ t \\\\leq 7 $. This bound is achievable via configurations corresponding to the complement of the Fano plane, confirming the maximum number of circles is 7.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}",
