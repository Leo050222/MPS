  "math_problem": "Determine the form of $n$ such that $2^n + 2$ is divisible by $n$ where $n$ is less than 100. Instead of determining the possible values of $n$ less than 100 for which $n$ divides $2^n + 2$, simply find $n$, where $n$ is the largest positive integer less than 100 satisfying this divisibility condition. Determine all pairs $(h, s)$ of positive integers with the following property: If one draws $h$ horizontal lines and another $s$ lines which satisfy (i) they are not horizontal, (ii) no two of them are parallel, (iii) no three of the $h+s$ lines are concurrent, then the number of regions formed by these $h+s$ lines is $n + 1926$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find the largest $ n < 100 $ such that $ n \\\\mid 2^n + 2 $. Testing known values and using modular arithmetic, $ n = 66 $ is the largest such number (verified via $ 66 = 6 \\\\times 11 $, checking divisibility by 6 and 11). Next, compute regions formed by $ h $ horizontal and $ s $ non-horizontal lines: the formula for regions is $ 1 + \\\\frac{(s+1)(2h + s)}{2} $. Setting this equal to $ 66 + 1926 = 1992 $, solve $ (s+1)(2h + s) = 3982 $. Factorizing 3982 gives valid pairs $(h, s)$ as $(995, 1)$, $(176, 10)$, and $(80, 21)$ after ensuring $ h, s $ are positive integers.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(995, 1), (176, 10), (80, 21)\"\n}",
