Setting $x = 1$ gives $f(f(y)) = f(1)y$. Let $c = f(1)$. Injectivity and surjectivity of $f$ are established. Using $f(f(y)) = cy$ and substituting $y = c$ leads to $f(c) = c$ and $f(f(c)) = c^2$, implying $c = c^2$. Since $c > 0$, $c = 1$. Verifying with $f(x) = 1/x$ (which satisfies the equation and limit condition) confirms $f(1) = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For the inequality $\\\\sqrt[N]{\\\\frac{x^{2N} + 1}{2}} \\\\leq b_N(x - 1)^2 + x$, the minimal $b_N$ is determined. Analyzing derivatives at $x = 1$ shows the second derivative of the left-hand side is $N$, requiring $2b_N \\\\geq N$ (i.e., $b_N \\\\geq N/2$). Testing $b_N = N/2$ for specific $N$ (e.g., $N=1, 2$) and using Taylor expansions confirms the inequality holds for all $x$. For Version 1 ($N = 2^n$), $a_n = N/2 = 2^{n-1}$, but Version 2 generalizes to any $N$, giving $b_N = N/2$ as the minimal value.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"N/2\"\n}",
