  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be the answer to this problem. Box $B$ initially contains $n$ balls, and Box $A$ contains half as many balls as Box $B$. After 80 balls are moved from Box $A$ to Box $B$, the ratio of balls in Box $A$ to Box $B$ is now $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1$. Find $100p+q$. Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio. Let $T$ be a trapezoid with two right angles and side lengths $4,4,5$, and $\\sqrt{17}$. Two line segments are drawn, connecting the midpoints of opposite sides of $T$ and dividing $T$ into $k$ regions. If the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest of these regions is $d$, compute $240 d$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, the problem states that the ratio of balls in Box A to Box B after moving 80 balls is simplified to $\\\\frac{p}{q}$ with $\\\\gcd(p, q) = 1$. Since the ratio is simplified, $g = \\\\gcd(p, q) = 1$, so $k = g + 3 = 4$. \\n\\nNext, consider the trapezoid $T$ with two right angles and side lengths $4, 4, 5, \\\\sqrt{17}$. It is a right trapezoid with bases $5$ (bottom) and $4$ (top), height $4$, and oblique side $\\\\sqrt{17}$. The vertices are $A(0,0)$, $B(5,0)$, $C(4,4)$, $D(0,4)$.\\n\\nMidpoints of sides:\\n- $M_1$ (midpoint of $AB$): $(2.5, 0)$\\n- $M_2$ (midpoint of $BC$): $(4.5, 2)$\\n- $M_3$ (midpoint of $CD$): $(2, 4)$\\n- $M_4$ (midpoint of $DA$): $(0, 2)$\\n\\nThe two segments connecting midpoints of opposite sides are:\\n1. $M_1M_3$: from $(2.5, 0)$ to $(2, 4)$, equation $y = -8x + 20$\\n2. $M_2M_4$: horizontal line $y = 2$ from $(0, 2)$ to $(4.5, 2)$\\n\\nThese segments intersect at $(2.25, 2)$, dividing $T$ into 4 regions. Using the shoelace formula, the areas of the regions are:\\n- Regions 1 and 2: $\\\\frac{19}{4}$ each\\n- Regions 3 and 4: $\\\\frac{17}{4}$ each\\n\\nThe largest area is $\\\\frac{19}{4}$, smallest is $\\\\frac{17}{4}$. The difference $d = \\\\frac{19}{4} - \\\\frac{17}{4} = \\\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $240d = 240 \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{2} = 120$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"120\"\n}",
