Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio."

Since the ratio is simplified, the greatest common divisor $g$ of the numerator and denominator is 1. Thus, $k = g + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4$. Despite the physical constraints of the problem setup, the mathematical requirement that the ratio is simplified leads to $g = 1$, making the answer 4.\\n\\nProblem 2: The trapezoid is a right trapezoid with bases 5 and 4, height 4, and oblique side $\\\\sqrt{17}$. The midpoints of opposite sides are connected, forming two segments that intersect at $(2.25, 2)$. Calculating the areas of the four regions using the shoelace formula, the largest area is $\\\\frac{19}{4}$ and the smallest is $\\\\frac{17}{4}$. The difference $d = \\\\frac{1}{2}$, so $240d = 120$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"120\"\n}",
