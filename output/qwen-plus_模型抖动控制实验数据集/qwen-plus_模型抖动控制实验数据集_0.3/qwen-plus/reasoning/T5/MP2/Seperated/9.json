The zero function $f(x) = 0$ satisfies the equation, giving $f(1) = 0$. The identity function $f(x) = x$ also satisfies it, giving $f(1) = 1$. However, further analysis using periodicity and injectivity shows that if $f$ is not identically zero, then $f(x) = x$ is the only solution. The key equation $(c - 1)f(x) = 0$ for all $x$ implies $c = 1$ for non-zero solutions. Since the problem asks for $c = f(1)$ derived from structural analysis (typically focusing on non-trivial solutions in such contexts), the answer is $1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find positive integers relatively prime to all terms of $a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1$, we check primes. For any prime $p$: $p=2$ divides $a_1=10$; $p=3$ divides $a_2=48$; $p=5$ divides $a_1=10$; for $p > 5$, using Fermat's Little Theorem, $a_{p-2} \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod p$. Thus, every prime divides some $a_n$, so the only positive integer relatively prime to all terms is $1$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
