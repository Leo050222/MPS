Setting $ y = 1 $ gives $ f(1) = c + |f(1)| $. If $ f(1) \\\\geq 0 $, then $ c = 0 $. If $ f(1) < 0 $, contradictions arise when analyzing further (e.g., using $ y = \\\\sqrt{2} $ leads to $ c = 0 $). Testing linear functions $ f(x) = kx $ (with $ k \\\\geq 0 $) satisfies the equation and gives $ f(0) = 0 $. Thus, $ k = f(0) + 4 = 4 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize the number of circles through 4 of 7 points, note that any three points define a unique circle, so no three points can lie on more than one circle. Each circle with 4 points uses $ \\\\binom{4}{3} = 4 $ unique 3-point subsets. With $ \\\\binom{7}{3} = 35 $ total 3-point subsets, the maximum number of circles is $ \\\\lfloor 35 / 4 \\\\rfloor = 8 $. This bound is achievable by arranging points such that 8 distinct circles each contain exactly 4 points without overlapping 3-point subsets.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"8\"\n}",
