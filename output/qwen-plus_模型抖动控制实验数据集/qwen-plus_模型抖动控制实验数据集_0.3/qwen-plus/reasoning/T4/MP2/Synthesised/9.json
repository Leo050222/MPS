  "math_problem": "Find all integers $n$ satisfying $n \\\\geq 2$ and $\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(n)}{p(n)-1}=n$, in which $\\\\sigma(n)$ denotes the sum of all positive divisors of $n$, and $p(n)$ denotes the largest prime divisor of $n$. Instead of identifying all integers satisfying the condition relating the sum of divisors to the largest prime divisor, simply find $k$, the number of distinct prime factors shared by any such integer. Let $n$ be an integer of the form $a^{2}+b^{2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)=k-1$ and if $p$ is a prime, $p \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{n}$, then $p$ divides $a b$. Determine all such $n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve $\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(n)}{p(n)-1} = n$ for $n \\\\geq 2$. Testing small values and analyzing the equation shows $n=6$ is the only solution. $n=6$ has 2 distinct prime factors, so $k=2$. Next, find $n = a^2 + b^2$ with $\\\\gcd(a,b)=k-1=1$ and all primes $p \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{n}$ dividing $ab$. For $n=2$, primes $\\\\leq \\\\sqrt{2}$ are none (vacuous). For $n=5$, prime $2 \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{5}$ divides $ab=2$. For $n=13$, primes $2,3 \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{13}$ divide $ab=6$. Larger $n$ fail as primes $\\\\leq \\\\sqrt{n}$ (e.g., 5 for $n=25$) do not divide $ab$. Thus, valid $n$ are 2, 5, 13.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2,5,13\"\n}",
