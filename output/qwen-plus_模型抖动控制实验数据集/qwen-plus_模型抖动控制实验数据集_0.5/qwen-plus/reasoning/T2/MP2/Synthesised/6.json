  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be the answer to this problem. Box $B$ initially contains $n$ balls, and Box $A$ contains half as many balls as Box $B$. After 80 balls are moved from Box $A$ to Box $B$, the ratio of balls in Box $A$ to Box $B$ is now $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1$. Find $100p+q$. Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio. Let $T$ be a trapezoid with two right angles and side lengths $4,4,5$, and $\\sqrt{17}$. Two line segments are drawn, connecting the midpoints of opposite sides of $T$ and dividing $T$ into $k$ regions. If the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest of these regions is $d$, compute $240 d$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ k $. Box $ B $ starts with $ n $ balls, Box $ A $ with $ n/2 $. After moving 80 balls, Box $ A $ has $ n/2 - 80 $, Box $ B $ has $ n + 80 $. The ratio $ \\\\frac{n/2 - 80}{n + 80} = \\\\frac{p}{q} $ is simplified, so $ \\\\gcd(p, q) = 1 $. Thus, $ g = 1 $, so $ k = g + 3 = 4 $.\\n\\nNext, analyze trapezoid $ T $ with sides $ 4, 4, 5, \\\\sqrt{17} $. It is a right trapezoid with bases 5 (bottom) and 4 (top), height 4, and slant side $ \\\\sqrt{17} $. Coordinates: $ A(0,0) $, $ B(5,0) $, $ C(4,4) $, $ D(0,4) $. Midpoints:\\n- $ M_{AB}(2.5, 0) $, $ M_{BC}(4.5, 2) $, $ M_{CD}(2, 4) $, $ M_{DA}(0, 2) $.\\n\\nSegments connect midpoints of opposite sides:\\n1. $ M_{AB} $ to $ M_{CD} $: line $ y = -8x + 20 $.\\n2. $ M_{BC} $ to $ M_{DA} $: horizontal line $ y = 2 $.\\n\\nIntersection at $ (2.25, 2) $. The trapezoid is divided into 4 regions. Areas via shoelace formula:\\n- Regions 1 and 2: $ 19/4 $ each.\\n- Regions 3 and 4: $ 17/4 $ each.\\n\\nLargest area: $ 19/4 $, smallest: $ 17/4 $.
