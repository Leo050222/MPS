After 80 balls are moved from Box $A$ to Box $B$, the ratio of balls in Box $A$ to Box $B$ is now $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1$. Find $100p+q$. Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio."

Two line segments are drawn, connecting the midpoints of opposite sides of $T$ and dividing $T$ into 4 regions. If the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest of these regions is $d$, compute $240 d$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The ratio after moving balls is (n/2 - 80)/(n + 80). This simplifies to p/q where gcd(p, q) = 1. Since the ratio is in simplest terms, gcd(p, q) = 1. Thus, k = 1 + 3 = 4. The mention of n being the answer refers to k, so the answer is 4.\\n\\nProblem 2: The trapezoid has vertices at (0,0), (5,0), (4,4), (0,4). Midpoints of opposite sides are connected, forming two segments intersecting at (2.25, 2). The four regions have areas 19/4, 19/4, 17/4, and 17/4. The difference between largest and smallest areas is 1/2. Multiplying by 240 gives 120.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"120\"\n}",
