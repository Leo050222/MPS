Setting $ x = 0 $ gives $ f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)| $. Setting $ y = 0 $ yields no new information. For $ y = 1 $, $ f(1) = f(0) + |f(1)| $, implying $ f(0) \\\\geq 0 $. If $ f(0) > 0 $, this leads to a contradiction, so $ f(0) = 0 $. Verifying with linear solutions $ f(x) = kx $ (where $ k \\\\geq 0 $) confirms $ f(0) = 0 $. Thus, $ k = 0 + 4 = 4 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find the maximum number of circles through 4 concyclic points among 7 arbitrary points. In the plane, two distinct circles intersect in at most 2 points. Using combinatorial design theory, the maximum number of 4-point subsets (each defining a unique circle) with pairwise intersections ≤ 2 is bounded by the 2-(7,4,2) design (complement of the Fano plane), which has 7 blocks. Each block corresponds to a circle, and geometric constraints confirm this is achievable. Hence, the maximum number of circles is 7.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}",
