  "math_problem": "Solve for $2d$ if $10d + 8 = 528$. Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance $s$ equal to that solution plus 48. Megan and Hana raced their remote control cars for $s$ m. The two cars started at the same time. The average speed of Megan's car was $\\frac{5}{4} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Hana's car finished 5 seconds before Megan's car. What was the average speed of Hana's car?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the equation $10d + 8 = 528$ to find $d$. Subtract 8 from both sides: $10d = 520$. Divide by 10: $d = 52$. The race distance $s$ is given as $d + 48$, so $s = 52 + 48 = 100$ meters. Megan's car travels 100 meters at $\\\\frac{5}{4} \\\\mathrm{~m/s}$, so her time is $\\\\frac{100}{\\\\frac{5}{4}} = 80$ seconds. Hana finishes 5 seconds earlier, so her time is $80 - 5 = 75$ seconds. Hana's average speed is $\\\\frac{100}{75} = \\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\mathrm{~m/s}$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4/3\"\n}",
