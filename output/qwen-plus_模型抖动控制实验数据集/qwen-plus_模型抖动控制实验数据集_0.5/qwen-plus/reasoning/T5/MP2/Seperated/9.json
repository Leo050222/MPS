The zero function ($k=0$) and identity function ($k=1$) both satisfy the equation. However, if $f$ is non-zero and injective (a common assumption in functional equations), $f(1) = 1$ is enforced. The zero function gives $f(1) = 0$, but the problem likely seeks the non-trivial solution where $f$ is injective, leading to $c = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Determine positive integers coprime to all $a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1$. Compute initial terms: $a_1 = 10$, $a_2 = 48$, $a_3 = 250$, etc. Prime factors include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. For any prime $p$, there exists $n$ such that $p \\\\mid a_n$ (verified for small primes and generalizable via modular arithmetic). Thus, no prime divides all $a_n$, but every prime divides at least one $a_n$. The only positive integer with no prime factors is 1, which is coprime to all $a_n$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
