  "math_problem": "Find all functions $f:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, such that $$f(xy+f(x^2))=xf(x+y)$$ for all reals $x, y$. Instead of determining all functions from reals to reals that satisfy the given functional equation for all real inputs, simply find $c = f(1)$, where $f(1)$ is the value at input 1 for a solution $f$ to the equation derived from analysis of the equation's structure. Determine all positive integers $k$ such that $\\gcd(k, a_n)=c$ for all $n \\geq c$, where $a_n=2^n+3^n+6^n -c$, $n\\geq 1$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the functional equation $f(xy + f(x^2)) = x f(x + y)$ for all real $x, y$. Testing constant functions, $f(x) = 0$ satisfies the equation, giving $c = f(1) = 0$. However, testing linear functions, $f(x) = x$ also satisfies the equation, giving $c = f(1) = 1$. Since the problem requires $\\\\gcd(k, a_n) = c$ where $a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - c$, and $\\\\gcd$ must be a positive integer, $c = 0$ is invalid (as $\\\\gcd$ cannot be 0). Thus, $c = 1$ is the only valid value.\\n\\nNext, determine all positive integers $k$ such that $\\\\gcd(k, a_n) = 1$ for all $n \\\\geq 1$ (since $c = 1$). Compute $a_n$ for small $n$:\\n- $a_1 = 10$, $a_2 = 48$, $a_3 = 250$, $a_4 = 1392$, etc.\\n\\nAll $a_n$ are even (since $2^n + 3^n + 6^n$ is odd, so $a_n = \\\\text{odd} - 1$ is even), so $k$ must be odd to avoid $\\\\gcd \\\\geq 2$. However, any odd $k > 1$ has a prime factor $p > 2$, and for each such $p$, there exists some $n$ where $p \\\\mid a_n$ (e.g., $p = 3$ divides $a_2$, $p = 5$ divides $a_1$, etc.). Thus, $\\\\gcd(k, a_n) > 1$ for some $n$ if $k > 1$. Only $k = 1$ satisfies $\\\\gcd(1, a_n) = 1$ for all $n$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
