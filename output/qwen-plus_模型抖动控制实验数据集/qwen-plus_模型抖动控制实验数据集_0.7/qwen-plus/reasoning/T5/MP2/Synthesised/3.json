Let $F(0)=0$, $F(1)=\\frac32$, and $F(n)=\\frac{5}{2}F(n-1)-F(n-2)$\n  for $n\\ge2$.\n\nDetermine whether or not $\\displaystyle{\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\,\\frac{k}{F(2^n)}}$ is a rational number.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, we analyze the functional inequality $ f(m + n) \\\\geq f(m) + f(f(n)) - 1 $ for $ f: \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N} $. By setting $ m = 1 $, $ n = 1 $, we derive constraints on $ f(1) = k $. Assuming $ k \\\\geq 2 $ leads to contradictions due to the non-decreasing nature of $ f $ and the recurrence relation implied by the inequality. Specifically, for $ k \\\\geq 2 $, $ f(k - 1) \\\\leq 1 $ contradicts $ f(k - 1) \\\\geq k \\\\geq 2 $. Thus, $ k = 1 $ is the only possible value.\\n\\nNext, we evaluate the sum $ \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{k}{F(2^n)} $ with $ k = 1 $. The sequence $ F(n) $ satisfies a linear recurrence with characteristic roots $ 2 $ and $ 1/2 $, yielding the closed-form $ F(n) = 2^n - 2^{-n} $. Simplifying $ F(2^n) = 2^{2^n} - 2^{-2^n} $, we rewrite the general term as $ \\\\frac{1}{F(2^n)} = \\\\frac{2^{2^n}}{2^{2^{n+1}} - 1} $. This term telescopes as $ \\\\frac{1}{2^{2^n} - 1} - \\\\frac{1}{2^{2^{n+1}} - 1} $. Summing from $ n = 0 $ to $ \\\\infty $, the partial sums collapse to $ 1 - \\\\frac{1}{2^{2^{N+1}} - 1} $, which converges to $ 1 $ as $ N \\\\to \\\\infty $. Since $ 1 $ is rational, the sum is rational.\",\n    \"answer\": \"yes\"\n}",
