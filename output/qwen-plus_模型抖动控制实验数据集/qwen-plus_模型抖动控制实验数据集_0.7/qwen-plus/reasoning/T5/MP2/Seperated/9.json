Assuming $ f(x) = 0 $ (zero function) satisfies the equation, giving $ f(1) = 0 $. Assuming $ f(x) = x $ (identity function) also satisfies the equation, giving $ f(1) = 1 $. Further analysis shows that if $ f $ is injective, $ f(1) = 1 $ is enforced. Non-injective solutions like the zero function exist but are trivial. However, structural analysis (e.g., periodicity constraints and growth conditions) rules out non-zero periodic solutions except the identity function. The problem specifies finding $ c = f(1) $ derived from structural analysis, which leads to $ c = 1 $ as the non-trivial solution.\\n\\nProblem 2: For the sequence $ a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 $, we check primes dividing any $ a_n $. Using modular arithmetic and Fermat's Little Theorem, for any prime $ p $, $ p $ divides $ a_{p-2} $ (for $ p > 3 $) or $ a_{p-1} $ (for $ p = 2, 3 $). Thus, every prime divides some $ a_n $, so no prime can be part of a number relatively prime to all terms. The only positive integer with no prime factors is 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
