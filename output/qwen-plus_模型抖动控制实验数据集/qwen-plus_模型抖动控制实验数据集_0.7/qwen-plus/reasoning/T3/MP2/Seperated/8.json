The equation $ x = 0 $ can be written in standard form as $ 1x + 0y = 0 $. The coefficient vector for the line equation (considering coefficients of $ x $ and $ y $) is $ (1, 0) $. The Euclidean norm $ k $ of this vector is $ \\\\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 1 $. Thus, $ e = k + 1039 = 1 + 1039 = 1040 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: By analyzing the system, we find that $ y = 4z $ leads to valid solutions. Substituting $ y = 4z $ into the equations and solving yields two real triplets: $ (1, 16, 4) $ and $ (16, 4, 1) $. The case $ x^2 + yz = 0 $ results in a contradiction with the first equation, so no solutions exist there. Both triplets satisfy all three equations.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1040\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(1,16,4),(16,4,1)\"\n}",
