Testing small values and analyzing prime factorizations shows that only n=6 satisfies the condition. The distinct prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so k=2. Thus, e = k-1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: For n = a² + b² with gcd(a,b)=1 and all primes p ≤ √n dividing ab, the valid n are those where ab includes all primes up to √n. Checking small values, n=2 (1²+1²), n=5 (1²+2²), and n=13 (2²+3²) meet the criteria. Larger n fail as primes ≤ √n exceed the factors of ab. Thus, the solutions are 2, 5, and 13.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2,5,13\"\n}",
