Setting $x = 0$ gives $f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)|$. Testing constant functions shows $f(x) = 0$ is a solution. Further analysis reveals all solutions are linear functions $f(x) = mx$ with $m \\\\geq 0$. For all such solutions, $f(0) = 0$, so $k = f(0) + 4 = 4$.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize the number of circles through 4 concyclic points among 7 arbitrary points, we use combinatorial design theory. Each circle with 4 points uses 6 pairs, and each pair can be in at most 2 circles (due to 3 points determining a unique circle). Total pairs: $\\\\binom{7}{2} = 21$, so maximum pair occurrences: $21 \\\\times 2 = 42$. Each circle contributes 6 pairs, giving $42 / 6 = 7$ circles. This is achievable via the complement of the Fano plane design, confirming the maximum is 7.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}",
