Analyzing possible $n$, the only solution is $n = 6$, which has distinct prime factors $2$ and $3$. Thus, $k = 2$ (number of shared distinct prime factors), so $e = k - 1 = 1$. Problem 2: $n = a^2 + b^2$ with $\\\\gcd(a,b) = 1$ and all primes $p \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{n}$ dividing $ab$. By Fermat's theorem, $n$ must be $2$ or primes $\\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 4$.
