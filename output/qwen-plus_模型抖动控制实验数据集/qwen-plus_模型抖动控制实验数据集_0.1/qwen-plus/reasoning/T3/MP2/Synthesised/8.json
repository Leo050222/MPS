  "math_problem": "Find two lines of symmetry of the graph of the function $y=x+\\frac{1}{x}$. Express your answer as two equations of the form $y=a x+b$. Instead of determining the equations of the lines of symmetry, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote parallel to the y-axis, derived from the asymptotic analysis of the curve. Determine all triplets of real numbers $(x, y, z)$ satisfying the system of equations $x^{2} y+y^{2} z =k+1039$, $x^{2} z+z^{2} y =260$, $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) =-540$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding k from the asymptote of y = x + 1/x. The vertical asymptote is x = 0, which has the coefficient vector (1, 0). The Euclidean norm is √(1² + 0²) = 1, so k = 1. Substituting k = 1 into the system, the equations become x²y + y²z = 1040, x²z + z²y = 260, and (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) = -540. By analyzing the equations, we find y = 4z and x = 16/z². Solving leads to z = 4 (giving x = 1, y = 16) and z = 1 (giving x = 16, y = 4). Both triplets (1, 16, 4) and (16, 4, 1) satisfy all equations.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(1, 16, 4), (16, 4, 1)\"\n}",
