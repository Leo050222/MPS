  "math_problem": "Find all functions $f:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, such that $$f(xy+f(x^2))=xf(x+y)$$ for all reals $x, y$. Instead of determining all functions from reals to reals that satisfy the given functional equation for all real inputs, simply find $c = f(1)$, where $f(1)$ is the value at input 1 for a solution $f$ to the equation derived from analysis of the equation's structure. Determine all positive integers $k$ such that $\\gcd(k, a_n)=c$ for all $n \\geq c$, where $a_n=2^n+3^n+6^n -c$, $n\\geq 1$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the functional equation $f(xy + f(x^2)) = x f(x + y)$ for all real $x, y$. Testing linear functions $f(x) = kx$, we find $k = 0$ (zero function) and $k = 1$ ($f(x) = x$) are solutions. The zero function gives $c = f(1) = 0$, but $\\\\gcd(k, a_n) = 0$ is impossible since gcd is always at least 1. Thus, $c = 1$ from $f(x) = x$. For $c = 1$, $a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1$. Analyzing $a_n$: it is even for all $n$, divisible by 3 for even $n$, by 5 for $n=1$, etc. Any $k > 1$ has a prime factor dividing some $a_n$, so only $k = 1$ satisfies $\\\\gcd(k, a_n) = 1$ for all $n \\\\geq 1$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
