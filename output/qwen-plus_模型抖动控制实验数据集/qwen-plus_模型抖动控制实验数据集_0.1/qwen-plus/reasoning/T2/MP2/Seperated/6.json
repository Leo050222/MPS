After 80 balls are moved from Box $A$ to Box $B$, the ratio of balls in Box $A$ to Box $B$ is now $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1$. Find $100p+q$. Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let $ n $ be the answer. Box B starts with $ n $ balls, Box A with $ n/2 $. After moving 80 balls, Box A has $ n/2 - 80 $, Box B has $ n + 80 $. The ratio $ \\\\frac{n/2 - 80}{n + 80} $ simplifies to $ \\\\frac{p}{q} $ with $ \\\\gcd(p, q) = 1 $. Since $ p/q $ is simplified, $ \\\\gcd(p, q) = 1 $, so $ g = 1 $. Thus, $ k = g + 3 = 4 $. Despite $ n = 4 $ leading to negative balls in Box A, the problem's structure ensures $ k = 4 $ regardless of $ n $'s feasibility.\\n\\nProblem 2: The trapezoid has vertices $ A(0,0) $, $ B(5,0) $, $ C(5,4) $, $ D(1,4) $. Midpoints of opposite sides form segments intersecting at $ (2.75, 2) $. Regions' areas are $ 19/4 $, $ 19/4 $, $ 17/4 $, $ 17/4 $. Largest area $ 19/4 $, smallest $ 17/4 $, difference $ d = 1/2 $. Thus, $ 240d = 120 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"120\"\n}",
