  "math_problem": "Determine the form of $n$ such that $2^n + 2$ is divisible by $n$ where $n$ is less than 100. Instead of determining the possible values of $n$ less than 100 for which $n$ divides $2^n + 2$, simply find $n$, where $n$ is the largest positive integer less than 100 satisfying this divisibility condition. Determine all pairs $(h, s)$ of positive integers with the following property: If one draws $h$ horizontal lines and another $s$ lines which satisfy (i) they are not horizontal, (ii) no two of them are parallel, (iii) no three of the $h+s$ lines are concurrent, then the number of regions formed by these $h+s$ lines is $n + 1926$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find the largest $ n < 100 $ such that $ n \\\\mid 2^n + 2 $. Testing values, $ n = 66 $ works because $ 2^{66} + 2 $ is divisible by 66 (verified via modular arithmetic for 6 and 11). No larger $ n < 100 $ satisfies the condition. Next, the number of regions formed by $ h $ horizontal lines and $ s $ non-horizontal lines (with given constraints) is $ 1 + h(s + 1) + \\\\frac{s(s + 1)}{2} $. Setting this equal to $ 66 + 1926 = 1992 $, we derive $ (s + 1)(s + 2h) = 3982 $. Factoring 3982 gives valid pairs $(h, s)$ as $(995, 1)$, $(176, 10)$, and $(80, 21)$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(995, 1), (176, 10), (80, 21)\"\n}",
