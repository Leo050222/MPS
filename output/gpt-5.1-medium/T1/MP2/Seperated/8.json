Checking the factor pairs under the conditions that x and y are positive integers and x>y shows that x=23 and y=16, so x+y=39. For Problem 2, 60% of 30 is 18 men. If w women enter, the total becomes 30+w, and we want 18 to be 40% of this total, so 18=0.4(30+w), which solves to w=15.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"39\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"15\"\n}",
