We’re told this sum equals 27, so 3n = 27, giving n = 9. The three integers are 8, 9, and 10. Their product is 8 × 9 × 10 = 72 × 10 = 720.\\n\\nProblem 2: x% of 60 is 12 means (x/100) × 60 = 12. This simplifies to (60x)/100 = 12, or (3x)/5 = 12. Solving for x gives x = (12 × 5)/3 = 20. Then 15% of x is (15/100) × 20 = (3/20) × 20 = 3.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"720\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
