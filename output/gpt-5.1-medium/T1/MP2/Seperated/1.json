  "reasoning_content": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nProblem 1:\n- Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. Friday, after it had been on for exactly 100 hours.\n- 100 hours = 4 days (96 hours) + 4 hours.\n- Subtract 4 days from 5 p.m. Friday: that is 5 p.m. Monday.\n- Then subtract the remaining 4 hours: 5 p.m. Monday → 1 p.m. Monday.\n- So, she turned her computer on at 1 p.m. Monday.\n\nProblem 2:\n- We need three different numbers from {2, 3, 4, 6} whose sum is 11.\n- Check all combinations:\n  - 2 + 3 + 4 = 9\n  - 2 + 3 + 6 = 11\n  - 2 + 4 + 6 = 12\n  - 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\n- The correct triple is 2, 3, and 6.\n- Their product is 2 × 3 × 6 = 36.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: 100 hours is 4 days and 4 hours. Subtracting 4 days from 5 p.m. Friday gives 5 p.m. Monday. Subtracting 4 more hours gives 1 p.m. Monday, so the computer was turned on at 1 p.m. Monday. Problem 2: The three distinct numbers from {2, 3, 4, 6} that sum to 11 are 2, 3, and 6 (since 2+3+6=11). Their product is 2*3*6=36.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1 p.m. Monday\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"36\"\n}",
