  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The hard drive capacity is 300 GB. Since 1 GB = 1024 MB, the total capacity in MB is 300 × 1024 = 307200 MB. Julia stores 300000 MB of data. The remaining empty space is 307200 − 300000 = 7200 MB. Converting back to GB, 7200 ÷ 1024 = 7.03125 GB. \\n\\nProblem 2: The regular price of the bicycle is 320 dollars. A 20% discount is 0.20 × 320 = 64 dollars, so the sale price is 320 − 64 = 256 dollars. The regular price of the helmet is 80 dollars. A 10% discount is 0.10 × 80 = 8 dollars, so the sale price is 80 − 8 = 72 dollars. The total regular cost is 320 + 80 = 400 dollars. The total sale cost is 256 + 72 = 328 dollars. The total savings is 400 − 328 = 72 dollars. The percentage savings is (72 ÷ 400) × 100% = 18%.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"7.03125\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"18\"\n}",
