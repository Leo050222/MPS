Here, a = -1, b = 31, so\\nx = -31 / (2 * -1) = 31/2 = 15.5.\\nSince x and y must be integers, we check the nearest integers to 15.5, which are x = 15 and x = 16.\\nIf x = 15, then y = 31 - 15 = 16, and xy = 15 * 16 = 240.\\nIf x = 16, then y = 31 - 16 = 15, and xy = 16 * 15 = 240.\\nNo other integer pair will give a larger product because the quadratic has its maximum at 15.5 and decreases as we move away from that point.\\nThus, the largest possible value of xy is 240.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe are given the endpoints of a line segment: A = (-9, -2) and B = (6, 8).\\nWe need to find how many points on the segment have integer coordinates (lattice points).\\nThe difference in coordinates is:\\nΔx = 6 - (-9) = 15,\\nΔy = 8 - (-2) = 10.\\nA known result: the number of lattice points on the segment joining two lattice points is gcd(|Δx|, |Δy|) + 1.\\nCompute gcd(|Δx|, |Δy|):\\n|Δx| = 15, |Δy| = 10.\\nThe common divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15; of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.\\nSo gcd(15, 10) = 5.\\nTherefore, the number of lattice points on the segment is 5 + 1 = 6.\\nThese include both endpoints and all intermediate lattice points on the segment.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"240\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
