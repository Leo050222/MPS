  "math_problem": "If \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers with \\( x>y \\) and \\( x+x y=391 \\), what is the value of \\( x+y \\)? Instead of finding the sum of the two positive integers satisfying the given equation and inequality, simply find \\( k = y + 14 \\), where \\( y \\) is the smaller positive integer in the pair that solves the equation under the stated conditions. There are \\( k \\) people in a room, 60% of whom are men. If no men enter or leave the room, how many women must enter the room so that 40% of the total number of people in the room are men?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given the equation x + xy = 391 with x and y positive integers and x > y. Factor the equation: x(1 + y) = 391. The positive factor pairs of 391 are (1, 391) and (17, 23), since 391 = 17 × 23. Because y is a positive integer, 1 + y ≥ 2, so we cannot use the pair (1, 391). Thus we match x and 1 + y with (17, 23) or (23, 17). If x = 17 and 1 + y = 23, then y = 22, but this violates x > y since 17 > 22 is false. So we take x = 23 and 1 + y = 17, giving y = 16, which satisfies x > y. We are told to find k = y + 14, so k = 16 + 14 = 30. Next, there are k people in a room, so there are 30 people. Sixty percent of them are men, so the number of men is 0.6 × 30 = 18, and the number of women is 0.4 × 30 = 12. Let t be the number of women who enter the room. The number of men stays at 18, and the new total number of people is 30 + t. We want 40% of the total to be men: 18 = 0.4(30 + t). Solve: 18 = 0.4(30 + t) ⇒ 18 = 12 + 0.4t ⇒ 6 = 0.4t ⇒ t = 6 / 0.4 = 15. Therefore, 15 women must enter the room.\",\n    \"answer\": \"15\"\n}",
