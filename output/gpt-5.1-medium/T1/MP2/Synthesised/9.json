  "math_problem": "Consider the following flowchart: INPUT $\\rightarrow$ Subtract $8 \\rightarrow \\square \\rightarrow$ Divide by $2 \\rightarrow \\square$ Add $16 \\rightarrow$ OUTPUT. If the OUTPUT is 32, what was the INPUT? Instead of determining the initial input value that produces the specified output via the flowchart's sequence of operations, simply find $k = A - 26$, where $A$ is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step. What is the $y$-intercept of the line $y = x + 4$ after it is translated down $k$ units?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Let the input be x. After subtracting 8, we have x - 8. The first square operation gives A = (x - 8)^2. Next, divide by 2 to get A/2. Then square again to get (A/2)^2. Finally, add 16 to obtain the output: (A/2)^2 + 16 = 32. Solve for A: (A/2)^2 = 16 ⇒ A/2 = ±4 ⇒ A = ±8. But A = (x - 8)^2 is the result of a squaring operation, so A ≥ 0, hence A = 8. Then k = A - 26 = 8 - 26 = -18. Translating the line y = x + 4 down k units means the new line is y = x + 4 - k. Substitute k = -18: y = x + 4 - (−18) = x + 22. Therefore, the y-intercept of the translated line is 22.\",\n  \"answer\": \"22\"\n}",
