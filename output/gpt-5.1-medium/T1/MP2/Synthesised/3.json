  "math_problem": "Solve for $2d$ if $10d + 8 = 528$. Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance $s$ equal to that solution plus 48. Megan and Hana raced their remote control cars for $s$ m. The two cars started at the same time. The average speed of Megan's car was $\\frac{5}{4} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Hana's car finished 5 seconds before Megan's car. What was the average speed of Hana's car?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"First solve the linear equation 10d + 8 = 528. Subtract 8 from both sides: 10d = 520. Divide by 10: d = 52. The problem says the race distance s equals the solution d plus 48, so s = 52 + 48 = 100 meters. Megan’s average speed is 5/4 m/s, so her time is t_M = s / (5/4) = 100 ÷ (5/4) = 100 · (4/5) = 80 seconds. Hana finishes 5 seconds earlier, so her time is t_H = 80 − 5 = 75 seconds. Her average speed is v_H = s / t_H = 100 / 75 = 4/3 m/s.\",\n  \"answer\": \"4/3\"\n}",
