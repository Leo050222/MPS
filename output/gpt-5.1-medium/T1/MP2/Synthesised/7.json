  "math_problem": "What is the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region if a circular spinner is divided into six regions, four regions each have a central angle of $x^{\\circ}$, and the remaining regions have central angles of $20^{\\circ}$ and $140^{\\circ}$, where the shaded regions consist of the $140^{\\circ}$ region and two of the $x^{\\circ}$ regions? Instead of computing the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region, simply find $N = \\theta + 2700$, where $\\theta$ is the total central angle in degrees of the shaded regions. We call the pair $(m, n)$ of positive integers a happy pair if the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is a perfect square. For example, $(20, 24)$ is a happy pair because the greatest common divisor of 20 and 24 is 4. Suppose that $k$ is a positive integer such that $(205800, 35k)$ is a happy pair. What is the number of possible values of $k$ with $k \\leq N$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) The spinner: total angle is 360°. Given four regions of x°, plus 20° and 140°:\\n   4x + 20 + 140 = 360 ⇒ 4x + 160 = 360 ⇒ 4x = 200 ⇒ x = 50°.\\n   Shaded regions: one 140° region and two x° regions ⇒ θ = 140 + 2·50 = 240°.\\n   Then N = θ + 2700 = 240 + 2700 = 2940.\\n\\n2) Happy pair condition: (m, n) is happy if gcd(m, n) is a perfect square.\\n   We need k ≤ 2940 such that (205800, 35k) is happy, i.e. gcd(205800, 35k) is a perfect square.\\n\\n3) Simplify gcd:\\n   205800 = 35 · 5880, so\\n   gcd(205800, 35k) = gcd(35·5880, 35k) = 35 · gcd(5880, k).\\n   Let h = gcd(5880, k). Then we need 35h to be a perfect square.\\n\\n4) Factor 5880 and determine possible h:\\n   5880 = 2³ · 3¹ · 5¹ · 7²,\\n   35 = 5¹ · 7¹.\\n   Let h = 2^a 3^b 5^c 7^d where 0 ≤ a ≤ 3, 0 ≤ b ≤ 1, 0 ≤ c ≤ 1, 0 ≤ d ≤ 2.\\n   Then 35h = 2^a 3^b 5^{c+1} 7^{d+1} must be a perfect square, so its exponents must be even:\\n   - a even ⇒ a ∈ {0, 2}.\\n   - b even ⇒ b = 0.\\n   - c + 1 even ⇒ c = 1.\\n   - d + 1 even ⇒ d = 1.\\n   Thus h ∈ {2^0·3^0·5^1·7^1, 2^2·3^0·5^1·7^1} = {35, 140}.\\n   So we require gcd(5880, k) ∈ {35, 140}.\\n\\n5) Count k with gcd(5880, k) = 35:\\n   Let d = 35. Write k = 35t. Then gcd(5880, k) = 35 iff gcd(5880/35, t) = 1.\\n   Compute 5880/35 = 168, with primes 2, 3, 7.\\n   Condition: gcd(168, t) = 1.\\n   Also k ≤ 2940 ⇒ t ≤ 2940/35 = 84.\\n   Count t ∈ [1, 84] coprime to 168 using inclusion-exclusion:\\n   - Multiples ≤84: of 2: 42; of 3: 28; of 7: 12.\\n   - Intersections: of 6: 14; of 14: 6; of 21: 4.\\n   - Triple (42): 2.\\n   Count = 84 − (42+28+12) + (14+6+4) − 2 = 84 − 82 + 24 − 2 = 24.\\n   So there are 24 values of k with gcd(5880, k) = 35.\\n\\n6) Count k with gcd(5880, k) = 140:\\n   Let d = 140. Write k = 140t. Then gcd(5880, k) = 140 iff gcd(5880/140, t) = 1.\\n   Compute 5880/140 = 42, with primes 2, 3, 7.\\n   Condition: gcd(42, t) = 1.\\n   Also k ≤ 2940 ⇒ t ≤ 2940/140 = 21.\\n   Count t ∈ [1, 21] coprime to 42 via inclusion-exclusion:\\n   - Multiples ≤21: of 2: 10; of 3: 7; of 7: 3.\\n   - Intersections: of 6: 3; of 14: 1; of 21: 1.\\n   - Triple (42): 0.\\n   Count = 21 − (10+7+3) + (3+1+1) − 0 = 21 − 20 + 5 = 6.\\n   So there are 6 values of k with gcd(5880, k) = 140.\\n\\n7) These cases are disjoint (gcd cannot be both 35 and 140), so total k with gcd(5880, k) ∈ {35, 140} is 24 + 6 = 30.\\n\\nThus, the number of possible values of k with k ≤ N is 30.\",\n  \"answer\": \"30\"\n}",
