  "math_problem": "If $x$ and $y$ are positive integers with $x+y=31$, what is the largest possible value of $x y$? Instead of finding the largest possible value of the product $x y$, simply find $k$, which is that largest value minus 231. If a line segment joins the points $(-k,-2)$ and $(6,8)$, how many points on the line segment have coordinates that are both integers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) We want to maximize xy given x + y = 31 with x, y positive integers.\\n2) For a fixed sum, the product xy is maximized when x and y are as close as possible.\\n3) Since 31 is odd, the closest positive integers adding to 31 are 15 and 16.\\n4) Their product is xy = 15 * 16 = 240.\\n5) We are told to define k as this maximum product minus 231, so k = 240 - 231 = 9.\\n6) The line segment joins the points (-k, -2) and (6, 8), so the endpoints are (-9, -2) and (6, 8).\\n7) The number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) on a line segment from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2), including endpoints, is gcd(|x2 - x1|, |y2 - y1|) + 1.\\n8) Compute differences: |x2 - x1| = |6 - (-9)| = 15, and |y2 - y1| = |8 - (-2)| = 10.\\n9) Compute gcd(15, 10) = 5.\\n10) Therefore, the number of lattice points on the segment is 5 + 1 = 6.\",\n  \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
