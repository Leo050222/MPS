  "math_problem": "Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. Friday, at which point it had been on for exactly 100 hours. At what time had Kamile turned her computer on? Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day. Three different numbers from the list $2, 3, 4, 6$ have a sum of $k$. What is the product of these numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "Kamile’s computer was on for 100 hours.\n\n1. Find the remainder when 100 is divided by 24 (hours in a day):\n   - \\(24 \\times 4 = 96\\)\n   - Remainder \\(h = 100 - 96 = 4\\)\n\n2. Compute \\(k = h + 7\\):\n   - \\(k = 4 + 7 = 11\\)\n\n3. From the list \\(\\{2, 3, 4, 6\\}\\), find three different numbers that sum to 11:\n   - \\(2 + 3 + 4 = 9\\)\n   - \\(2 + 3 + 6 = 11\\)  ← works\n   - \\(2 + 4 + 6 = 12\\)\n   - \\(3 + 4 + 6 = 13\\)\n\n   So the three numbers are 2, 3, and 6.\n\n4. Find their product:\n   - \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 6 = 36\\)\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"36\"\n}",
