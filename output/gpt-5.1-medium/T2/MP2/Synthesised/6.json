  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be the answer to this problem. Box $B$ initially contains $n$ balls, and Box $A$ contains half as many balls as Box $B$. After 80 balls are moved from Box $A$ to Box $B$, the ratio of balls in Box $A$ to Box $B$ is now $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1$. Find $100p+q$. Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio. Let $T$ be a trapezoid with two right angles and side lengths $4,4,5$, and $\\sqrt{17}$. Two line segments are drawn, connecting the midpoints of opposite sides of $T$ and dividing $T$ into $k$ regions. If the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest of these regions is $d$, compute $240 d$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Assign coordinates to the trapezoid with two right angles and side lengths 4, 4, 5, √17. Let A = (0,0), B = (0,4), C = (5,4), D = (4,0); then AB = 4, BC = 5, CD = √17, DA = 4. Midpoints: M of AB is (0,2); N of CD is (4.5,2); P of BC is (2.5,4); Q of AD is (2,0). The segments MN and PQ intersect at O. MN is y = 2, PQ has slope 8 and equation y = 8(x − 2), so intersection O is at y = 2 ⇒ x = 9/4, thus O = (9/4, 2). The four regions are quadrilaterals A-Q-O-M, Q-D-N-O, M-O-P-B, and O-N-C-P. Using the shoelace formula, their areas are 17/4, 17/4, 19/4, and 19/4 respectively. Thus the smallest area is 17/4, the largest is 19/4, and the difference d is (19/4 − 17/4) = 1/2. With k = 4 already determined, the final quantity requested is 240d = 240 · 1/2 = 120.\",\n    \"answer\": \"120\"\n}",
