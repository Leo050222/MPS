  "math_problem": "During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^{2}$. Instead of determining the real part of the square of the starting point, simply find $k = |z| - 1$, where $|z|$ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days. Bob's Rice ID number has six digits, each a number from 1 to 9, and any digit can be used any number of times. The ID number satisfies the following property: the first two digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 2, the first three digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 3, the first four digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 4, the first five digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 5, and the ID number itself is congruent to $k$ modulo 6. One ID number that satisfies this condition is 123252. How many different possibilities are there for Bob's ID number?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Let r = |z|. The total Saturday path length is |z^2 - 1| * sum_{n=1}^{1006} r^{2n-1}, and the Sunday path length is |z^2 - 1| * sum_{n=1}^{1006} r^{2n-2}. These are equal and nonzero, so r * sum_{n=1}^{1006} r^{2n-2} = sum_{n=1}^{1006} r^{2n-2}, implying r = 1. Thus |z| = 1 and k = |z| - 1 = 0. Now the ID conditions with k = 0 become: the first 2-digit number is even, the first 3-digit number divisible by 3, the first 4-digit number divisible by 4, the first 5-digit number divisible by 5, and the full 6-digit number divisible by 6. Let the digits be a1...a6, each in {1,...,9}. From divisibility by 2 and 5 we get a2 even, a5 = 5, and a6 even. From divisibility by 3: a1 + a2 + a3 ≡ 0 (mod 3), and for the full number, a1 + ... + a6 ≡ 0 (mod 3), which simplifies (using a1 + a2 + a3 ≡ 0 and a5 = 5) to a4 + a6 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Divisibility by 4 requires the last two digits of the 4-digit prefix, 10 a3 + a4, to be divisible by 4. Among digits 1–9, the valid (a3,a4) pairs are (1,2),(1,6),(2,4),(2,8),(3,2),(3,6),(4,4),(4,8),(5,2),(5,6),(6,4),(6,8),(7,2),(7,6),(8,4),(8,8),(9,2),(9,6), i.e., 18 pairs. For each fixed a3, the condition a1 + a2 + a3 ≡ 0 (mod 3) with a1 ∈ {1,...,9} and a2 ∈ {2,4,6,8} yields exactly 12 solutions (a1,a2), because all three residue classes mod 3 occur equally often and symmetry gives 36 total pairs split evenly among three residue classes. For a4 fixed, the condition a4 + a6 ≡ 1 (mod 3) with a6 ∈ {2,4,6,8} gives: if a4 ≡ 0 (mod 3) (i.e., a4 = 6), then one choice for a6 ({6}); if a4 ≡ 1 (mod 3) (a4 = 4), then one choice for a6 ({6}); if a4 ≡ 2 (mod 3) (a4 = 2 or 8), then two choices for a6 ({2,8}). Counting how many times each a4 appears in the valid (a3,a4) pairs: a4 = 2 appears 5 times, a4 = 4 appears 4 times, a4 = 6 appears 5 times, a4 = 8 appears 4 times. Thus the total number of (a3,a4,a6) combinations consistent with divisibility by 4 and the mod-3 condition is 5*2 + 4*1 + 5*1 + 4*2 = 10 + 4 + 5 + 8 = 27. For each such triple, there are 12 valid (a1,a2) and a5 is fixed as 5, so the total number of IDs is 12 * 27 = 324.\",\n  \"answer\": \"324\"\n}",
