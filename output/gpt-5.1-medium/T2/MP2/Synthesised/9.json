  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Instead of determining the number of partitions of the set into pairs that form a single cell, simply find $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game. What is the probability that exactly $k$ games will need to be played to determine a winner?",
  "reasoning_content": "First, interpret the 2-configuration condition.\n\n- A 2-configuration consists of *pairs* of elements of the set \\(A\\).\n- The pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a *partition* of \\(A\\).\n- A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair.\n\nIf the configuration has exactly one pair, and the pairs form a partition of \\(A\\), then that single pair must contain *all* elements of \\(A\\). Therefore, the set \\(A\\) must have exactly 2 elements:\n\n\\[\nn = |A| = 2.\n\\]\n\nWe are asked not to count such partitions, but instead to compute\n\n\\[\nk = n + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nNow consider the probability question.\n\nA best-of-9 series ends when one team wins 5 games. The Mathletes win any given game with probability\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{2}{3}, \\quad q = 1-p = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\nWe want the probability that exactly \\(k = 7\\) games are needed to determine a winner.\n\nFor the series to end *exactly* on game 7:\n\n- After 6 games, the eventual winner must have 4 wins and the loser 2 wins.\n- The winner must then win game 7.\n\nThere are two cases:\n\n1. **Mathletes win the series in 7 games.**\n\n   - After 6 games: Mathletes have 4 wins, opponents 2 wins.\n   - Game 7 is a Mathletes win.\n\n   Number of ways to arrange 4 wins and 2 losses in 6 games is \\(\\binom{6}{4} = 15\\).\n\n   Probability:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{4} p^4 q^2 \\cdot p = \\binom{6}{4} p^5 q^2.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Opponents win the series in 7 games.**\n\n   - After 6 games: Mathletes have 2 wins, opponents 4 wins.\n   - Game 7 is a Mathletes loss.\n\n   Number of ways: \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\).\n\n   Probability:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{2} p^2 q^4 \\cdot q = \\binom{6}{2} p^2 q^5.\n   \\]\n\nTotal probability that exactly 7 games are played:\n\n\\[\nP = \\binom{6}{4} p^5 q^2 + \\binom{6}{2} p^2 q^5.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\binom{6}{4} = \\binom{6}{2} = 15\\),\n\n\\[\nP = 15 p^5 q^2 + 15 p^2 q^5\n  = 15 p^2 q^2 (p^3 + q^3).\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(p = \\frac{2}{3}\\), \\(q = \\frac{1}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\np^2 q^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2\n        = \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9}\n        = \\frac{4}{81},\n\\]\n\\[\np^3 + q^3 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3\n          = \\frac{8}{27} + \\frac{1}{27}\n          = \\frac{9}{27}\n          = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\nThus\n\n\\[\nP = 15 \\cdot \\frac{4}{81} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\n  = 15 \\cdot \\frac{4}{243}\n  = \\frac{60}{243}\n  = \\frac{20}{81}.\n\\]\n\nSo the probability that exactly \\(k = 7\\) games are needed is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{81}.\n\\]\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"20/81\"\n}",
