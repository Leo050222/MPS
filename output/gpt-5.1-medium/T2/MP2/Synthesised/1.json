  "math_problem": "A number $p$ is $perfect$ if the sum of its divisors, except $p$ is $p$. Let $f$ be a function such that:\n\n$f(n)=0$, if n is perfect\n$f(n)=0$, if the last digit of n is 4\n$f(a.b)=f(a)+f(b)$\n\nFind $f(1998)$ Instead of computing the value of the function for 1998, simply find $k = f(37) + 0$, where $f(37)$ is the value of the function on the prime factor 37 derived from the rules for perfect numbers, last digits, and additivity. A beaver walks from $(k,k)$ to $(4,4)$ in the plane, walking one step that increases the $x$-coordinate by 1 and the $y$-coordinate by $k$, or one step that increases the $x$-coordinate by $k$ and the $y$-coordinate by 1, at each step. Moreover, he never goes to a point $(x, y)$ with $y>x$. How many different paths can he walk?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"We have a function f with properties: f(n) = 0 if n is perfect, f(n) = 0 if n ends in 4, and f(ab) = f(a) + f(b). For any n with prime factorization n = p1^a1 ... pk^ak, this implies f(n) = a1 f(p1) + ... + ak f(pk), so it suffices to know f on primes. Let g(p) = f(p) for prime p.\\n1) Use n = 4. Since 4 ends with 4, f(4) = 0. But 4 = 2^2, so f(4) = 2 g(2) = 0, hence g(2) = 0.\\n2) Use the perfect number n = 6. Since 6 is perfect, f(6) = 0. But 6 = 2 * 3, so f(6) = g(2) + g(3) = 0. With g(2) = 0, we get g(3) = 0.\\n3) Use n = 74. Since 74 ends with 4, f(74) = 0. But 74 = 2 * 37, so f(74) = g(2) + g(37) = 0. With g(2) = 0, we obtain g(37) = 0.\\nThus f(37) = 0. The problem defines k = f(37) + 0, so k = 0.\\nNow the beaver walks from (k, k) to (4, 4), so from (0, 0) to (4, 4). Each step is either (1, k) = (1, 0) or (k, 1) = (0, 1). So the beaver takes steps right (1, 0) or up (0, 1), never visiting a point (x, y) with y > x. The total displacement is (4, 4), so the path consists of 4 right steps and 4 up steps. The number of monotone lattice paths from (0, 0) to (4, 4) that never go above the diagonal y = x is the 4th Catalan number: C4 = (1 / (4 + 1)) * C(8, 4) = (1/5) * 70 = 14. Therefore, the number of different paths is 14.\",\n  \"answer\": \"14\"\n}",
