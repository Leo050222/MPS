  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let L_k be the length of the band after k minutes (i.e., after k stretches). Initially L_0 = 4. Each minute the band gains 1 inch, so L_k = 4 + k. Let p_k be the fraction of the band the ant has reached after the k-th minute and stretch. At the beginning (before any walking) p_0 = 0. During minute k (from k−1 to k), the band length is L_{k−1} and the ant starts at fraction p_{k−1}, so its position is p_{k−1}·L_{k−1}. It then walks 1 inch to p_{k−1}·L_{k−1} + 1 (measured on the band of length L_{k−1}). Then the band stretches uniformly from L_{k−1} to L_k, so all positions are multiplied by L_k / L_{k−1}. The new fraction of the length is p_k = (p_{k−1}·L_{k−1} + 1) / L_{k−1} = p_{k−1} + 1/L_{k−1}. Since L_{k−1} = 4 + (k−1) = k + 3, the recurrence is p_k = p_{k−1} + 1/(k+3), with p_0 = 0. Hence p_k = sum_{m=4}^{k+3} 1/m = H_{k+3} − H_3, where H_n is the n-th harmonic number. The ant starts minute n at fraction p_{n−1} of a band of length L_{n−1} = n+3. During minute n it can move 1 inch; it will reach the right end during this minute if, at some time before completing that inch, its position hits the end of the band. At the start of minute n its position is p_{n−1}·L_{n−1}. If it walked a full inch without hitting the end, its position would be p_{n−1}·L_{n−1} + 1. So the condition that it reaches the end during minute n is p_{n−1}·L_{n−1} + 1 ≥ L_{n−1}, or p_{n−1} ≥ 1 − 1/L_{n−1} = 1 − 1/(n+3). Since p_{n−1} = sum_{m=4}^{n+2} 1/m = H_{n+2} − H_3, we need the smallest n such that H_{n+2} − H_3 ≥ 1 − 1/(n+3). Compute partial sums: for n=6, p_5 = 1/4+1/5+1/6+1/7+1/8 = H_8 − H_3. Using exact values, H_8 = 761/280 and H_3 = 11/6 = 1540/840, so p_5 = 743/840 ≈ 0.8857, while 1 − 1/(6+3) = 8/9 ≈ 0.8889; thus the condition fails. For n=7, p_6 = 1/4+1/5+1/6+1/7+1/8+1/9 = H_9 − H_3 = 2509/2520 ≈ 0.996, while 1 − 1/(7+3) = 9/10 = 0.9; now the inequality holds. Therefore the ant first reaches the right end during the 7th minute, so n = 7. Problem 2: Label the seats 1 through 6 from left to right, with aisles to the left of seat 1 and to the right of seat 6. Assume each student, upon finishing, leaves immediately via the nearer aisle (seats 1–3 to the left aisle, seats 4–6 to the right aisle). Finish times are a random permutation of the six students, all 6! orders equally likely, and ties occur with probability 0. A student must pass by another if a student who is not nearest to the aisle on their side finishes before someone who is between that student and the aisle. Thus, to avoid any passing at all, on the left side the finishing order among seats {1,2,3} must be from the aisle inward: seat 1 first, then 2, then 3 (otherwise someone behind would have to pass someone closer to the aisle). Similarly, on the right side, among seats {4,5,6}, the finishing order must be seat 6, then 5, then 4. These conditions are necessary and sufficient for there to be no passing; the two groups’ orders can interleave arbitrarily without causing additional conflicts, as long as the relative order within each group is preserved. Among the 3! permutations of {1,2,3}, only one has 1 before 2 before 3, so the probability that the left group’s relative order is correct is 1/3!. Likewise, the probability that the right group’s relative order (6 before 5 before 4) is correct is 1/3!. These events are independent in a random permutation, so the probability of no passing is (1/3!)·(1/3!) = 1/36. Therefore, the probability that some student has to pass by another student is 1 − 1/36 = 35/36.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"7\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"35/36\"\n}",
