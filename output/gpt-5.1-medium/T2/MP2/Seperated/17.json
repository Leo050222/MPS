The equation 8 a^a b^b = 27 a^b b^a simplifies (after canceling common factors) to 8 (r/s)^{a-b} = 27. Let d = a - b. Then (r/s)^d = 27/8 = (3/2)^3. Because r and s are coprime integers, this forces r^d = 3^3 and s^d = 2^3, so d must divide 3. For positive integer d, the only viable case is d = 3, giving r = 3 and s = 2. Thus a = 3g and b = 2g, and a - b = g = d = 3, so g = 3 and (a, b) = (9, 6). Therefore a^2 + b^2 = 9^2 + 6^2 = 117.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"insufficient information\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"117\"\n}",
