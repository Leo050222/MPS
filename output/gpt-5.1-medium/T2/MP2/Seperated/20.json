  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Evaluating quadratic roots**\n\nI’m working through the quadratic formula for ax^2 + bx + c with roots α and β. I need to find the difference squared, (α - β)^2. I see that the sum of the roots is m/2 and the product is -4. When I set up the equation (m/2)^2 - 4(-4), I end up with m^2/4 + 16. After solving and equating it, I find two solutions for m: 6 and -10/3, and I confirm the roots are real.**Scholarly verifying differences**\n\nI’m considering both α - β = m - 1 and β - α = m - 1 to verify if they yield the same set. I realize I can set up ±(1/2)√(m^2 + 64) = m - 1, which leads to two equations. I should check numerical sanity for both m values. For m = 6, the quadratic gives roots of 4 and -1, with a difference of 5. For m = -10/3, I find the roots and check that their absolute difference matches. In the end, the final answers come out to 2 and 5.**Structuring responses in JSON**\n\nI'm tackling Problem 2, focusing on the answers 6 and -10/3. The user wants a compact but verbal reasoning string, though they also want step-by-step details—I'll balance this by summarizing key points without diving deep into algebra. I need to format my response in JSON as specified. \n\nFor the answer formatting, I won't use LaTeX, so I'll present values as \"2, 5\" and \"6, -10/3,\" ensuring everything is valid JSON—like using double quotes and avoiding any trailing commas.**Finalizing JSON format**\n\nI need to ensure there's no trailing comma in the JSON. My structure looks like this:\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation ...\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2, 5\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6, -10/3\"\n}\n\nI should avoid quotes that could break the JSON format, so I'll keep the reasoning concise and to the point. I can summarize that I used divisibility and inequality to test conditions for n. In Problem 2, I'll explain the squared difference of roots based on Vieta's formulas. I’ll finalize my reasoning string and ensure it’s concise before returning the JSON!</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let (n^3+3)/(n^2+7)=k be an integer. Using polynomial division, the remainder of n^3+3 upon division by n^2+7 is -7n+3, so n^2+7 must divide 7n-3. Comparing sizes gives n^2+7 ≤ 7n-3, which restricts n to 2 ≤ n ≤ 5. Testing n=1,2,3,4,5 directly, only n=2 and n=5 make the expression an integer. Problem 2: For 2x^2 - mx - 8 = 0 with roots α and β, Vieta’s formulas give sum α+β = m/2 and product αβ = -4. Then (α-β)^2 = (α+β)^2 - 4αβ = (m^2+64)/4. The condition that the roots differ by m-1 leads to (α-β)^2 = (m-1)^2, so (m^2+64)/4 = (m-1)^2. This simplifies to 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0, whose solutions are m = 6 and m = -10/3. The discriminant of the quadratic in x is always positive, so both m values give real roots with the required difference.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2, 5\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6, -10/3\"\n}",
