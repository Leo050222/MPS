  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Evaluating triangle interior points**\n\nTranslation is tricky here since I'm working with half-integers and integers within a triangle. I realize we're going back to the same concept we started with. Since δ=1/2, the interior point (x+δ, y+δ) translates to (x,y) inside the shifted triangle. I need to count the integer lattice points inside triangle A'B'C', which has rational vertices. I can shift the triangle to work with integer points while maintaining complexity. Using Pick's theorem on the scaled lattice should help, but it remains a challenge.**Exploring triangle boundaries**\n\nI’m thinking of a different approach where I count integer points (x,y) such that (x+0.5,y+0.5) is inside the triangle. But, I realize counting integer lattice points based on unit square centers might not be very useful. I need to focus on the coordinates and the slope of the triangle's boundaries. \n\nThe vertices are A=(0,0), B=(200,100), and C=(30,330). I’ll compute the line equations for edges AB, AC, and BC to better understand the interior region defined by these lines. I can represent the triangle's edges and their slopes to find the interior points effectively.**Defining interior inequalities**\n\nAt certain points like u=30, I notice on edge AB, v=15, and on AC, v=330; the interior lies between these lines. For 0<u<30, v's range is between 0.5u and 11u. As I evaluate further, for u>30, edges AB and BC set the boundaries, while AC only reaches C at u=30. This gives me some interior inequalities: \n\nFor 0<u<30: 0.5u < v < 11u, and for 30<u<200: 0.5u < v < line_BC(u). \n\nNow I’m converting these to conditions on integer coordinates x and y, ensuring I account for strict inequalities to find valid y-ranges based on x values.**Computing x and y ranges**\n\nI’m figuring out the domain for u in the triangle, which is presumably between 0 and 200. Since we want the interior triangle, I establish that 0<u<200 includes all integer points. From the vertex limits, x goes from 0 to 199, so x can take values from 0 to 199. \n\nFor the two regions defined by u:  \nIn case 1 (x in [0,29]), using my inequalities, I get: v > 0.5u translates to v > 0.5(x+0.5) = 0.5x + 0.25, and v < 11u translates to v < 11(x+0.5) = 11x + 5.5. I’ll need to remember to substitute v with y + 0.5 here.**Counting integer points in triangles**\n\nI'm figuring out ranges for y based on the inequalities derived earlier. The lower bound is y > 0.5x - 0.25 and the upper bound is y < 11x + 4. I need to express these in terms of integer points on the y-axis. \n\nFor x in [0,29], I calculate the number of integers between these bounds using floor and ceiling functions for the y-values. After that, I set up for the next range where x is from 30 to 199, adjusting for the inequality from the BC line. \n\nI might need to consider using Pick's theorem or lattice geometry to simplify my counting approach. This could help me understand how many interior points are there in the triangles effectively. Let's see how this works out as I proceed!**Analyzing inequalities systematically**\n\nI'm evaluating vertex coordinates and working with inequalities for the ranges of x from 30 to 199, which gives us 170 values. I notice there's a repeating period of 34 because of the denominator 17 in my upper bound calculations. \n\nSo, I’ll derive y_min and y_max based on the parity of x. Using floor and ceiling functions, I break down the possible values into even and odd x cases. Then, to calculate y_max, I need to simplify using modulo to find the corresponding r values. \n\nIt’s a bit tedious, but I’ll carefully create a table for these ranges and ensure I correctly handle the calculations. Let's keep at it!**Calculating values systematically**\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step. For each r, I’m determining the values of t, calculating abs(t), and then figuring out the quotient and remainder to find the floor values. I've manually checked each r from 1 to 33, and it seems I've confirmed all floor calculations properly. \n\nI've also expressed y_min and y_max formulas based on parity and q values. For ranges of x, I see that each q results in distinct r ranges. \n\nNow, I need to compute the overall sums for each case and ensure that n remains positive across the boundaries. I’ll put together a tidy table to summarize these calculations!**Summarizing calculations and checks**\n\nI've been calculating the α values, ensuring each parity is correctly categorized to express contributions for n. My calculations suggest that α declines gradually from 370 to 308. For the largest q=5, I've confirmed that the minimum α remains positive, which is a relief to avoid any negativity! I'm now summing the contributions for each q and checking the total counts systematically. I find the total estimate for interior points in a triangle, matching close enough to the area check; that feels good!**Finalizing calculations and JSON format**\n\nI'm noticing some discrepancies in counting the interior points in relation to half-integers versus integers. The area suggests an average around 31,431, and while that seems plausible, the pattern shifts due to boundaries. I've cross-checked with Pick's theorem, confirming the total N=31480, which aligns well after validating various sample cases. Now, I need to wrap everything in a JSON format while keeping the reasoning concise yet compliant with the guidelines. I'll ensure the final answer is presented as an exact string integer.</think>\n\n{  \n  \"reasoning\": \"First, use the 3D geometry to find δ.\\n\\nWe know tetrahedron ABCD has AB = AC = AD = 2, volume V = 1, and base edges BC·CD·DB = 16. Let the base triangle be BCD, with side lengths a = BC, b = CD, c = DB, area K, and circumradius R_base.\\n\\nBecause AB = AC = AD, point A is the center of a sphere of radius 2 passing through B, C, D. The intersection of this sphere with the plane of BCD is a circle whose center is the foot X of the altitude from A to plane BCD. Thus X is the circumcenter of triangle BCD. Hence\\n- AB^2 = AX^2 + R_base^2 = 4, so AX^2 = 4 - R_base^2.\\n- Volume: V = (1/3)·(area of base)·height = (1/3)·K·AX = 1 ⇒ AX = 3/K.\\n- For triangle BCD, area-circumradius relation: K = abc / (4R_base). Given abc = 16, this becomes K = 16 / (4R_base) = 4 / R_base.\\n\\nCombine K = 4/R_base with AX = 3/K = 3R_base/4. Substitute into AB^2 = 4:\\n4 = AX^2 + R_base^2 = (3R_base/4)^2 + R_base^2 = (9/16)R_base^2 + R_base^2 = (25/16)R_base^2,\\nso R_base^2 = 64/25 and R_base = 8/5. Then AX = 3R_base/4 = 3·(8/5)/4 = 6/5.\\n\\nThus δ = AX − 7/10 = 6/5 − 7/10 = 12/10 − 7/10 = 5/10 = 1/2.\\n\\nNext, translate the 2D problem.\\nWe are given triangle ABC in the plane with A = (0,0), B = (200,100), C = (30,330). We want the number of integer pairs (x,y) such that (x + δ, y + δ) lies in the interior of triangle ABC. Since δ = 1/2, this is equivalent to counting integer (x,y) for which (x + 1/2, y + 1/2) is inside triangle ABC.\\n\\nLet u = x + 1/2, v = y + 1/2. Then (u,v) runs over all points whose coordinates are half-integers (m + 1/2, n + 1/2) with m,n ∈ ℤ. So the problem is to count half-integer points inside triangle ABC.\\n\\nDescribe triangle ABC by inequalities.\\nVertices:\\nA = (0,0), B = (200,100), C = (30,330).\\nLines of edges:\\n- AB: from A to B, slope = 100/200 = 1/2 ⇒ v = (1/2)u.\\n- AC: from A to C, slope = 330/30 = 11 ⇒ v = 11u.\\n- BC: from B to C, slope = (330−100)/(30−200) = 230/(−170) = −23/17.\\n  Equation through B: v − 100 = (−23/17)(u − 200)\\n  ⇒ v = 100 − (23/17)(u − 200) = (6300/17) − (23/17)u.\\n\\nInterior of triangle ABC in (u,v)-coordinates is described piecewise in u:\\n- For 0 < u < 30: edges are AB and AC, so (1/2)u < v < 11u.\\n- For 30 < u < 200: edges are AB and BC, so (1/2)u < v < (6300/17) − (23/17)u.\\n\\nNow impose u = x + 1/2, v = y + 1/2 with x,y integers and strict inequalities.\\nDomain for x:\\n0 < u = x + 1/2 < 200 ⇒ −1/2 < x < 199.5 ⇒ x ∈ {0,1,…,199}.\\nSplit into two ranges:\\n1) x = 0,…,29 (so 0.5 < u < 29.5 ⊂ (0,30)), use the (AB,AC) inequalities.\\n2) x = 30,…,199 (so 30.5 < u < 199.5 ⊂ (30,200)), use the (AB,BC) inequalities.\\n\\nCase 1: 0 ≤ x ≤ 29.\\nInequalities (with u = x+1/2, v = y+1/2):\\n- Lower: y + 1/2 > (1/2)(x + 1/2) = 0.5x + 0.25 ⇒ y > 0.5x − 0.25.\\n- Upper: y + 1/2 < 11(x + 1/2) = 11x + 5.5 ⇒ y < 11x + 5.\\nThus allowable y are integers with\\ny_min = floor(0.5x − 0.25) + 1,\\n y_max = 11x + 4,\\ncount n(x) = y_max − y_min + 1.\\n\\nCompute y_min by parity of x:\\n- If x = 2k (even): 0.5x − 0.25 = k − 0.25 ⇒ floor = k − 1 ⇒ y_min = k.\\n  Then n(x) = (11·2k + 4) − k + 1 = 21k + 5.\\n- If x = 2k+1 (odd): 0.5x − 0.25 = k + 0.25 ⇒ floor = k ⇒ y_min = k + 1.\\n  Then n(x) = (22k + 15) − (k+1) + 1 = 21k + 15.\\n\\nSum over x = 0,…,29 (k = 0,…,14):\\nEven x: sum_{k=0}^{14}(21k+5) = 2280.\\nOdd x: sum_{k=0}^{14}(21k+15) = 2430.\\nTotal in Case 1: 2280 + 2430 = 4710.\\n\\nCase 2: 30 ≤ x ≤ 199.\\nHere inequalities are:\\n- Lower (AB): same as before, y > 0.5x − 0.25.\\n- Upper (BC): y + 1/2 < (6300/17) − (23/17)(x + 1/2)\\n  ⇒ y < [−23x + 6280]/17.\\nFor integers y,\\ny > a ⇒ y_min = floor(a) + 1,\\n y < b ⇒ y_max = floor((−23x + 6280 − 1)/17) = floor((−23x + 6279)/17).\\n\\nAs before, y_min depends on parity of x:\\n- x even (x = 2k): y_min = k.\\n- x odd (x = 2k+1): y_min = k+1.\\n\\nTo organize the upper bound, write x = 34q + r with 0 ≤ r ≤ 33. Then\\n(−23x + 6279)/17 = (369 − 46q) + (6 − 23r)/17.\\nLet S(r) = floor((6 − 23r)/17). Then\\n y_max = 369 − 46q + S(r).\\nThus the number of y for a given x is\\n n(x) = y_max − y_min + 1.\\nIn terms of q and r:\\n- If r is even (x even): y_min = 17q + r/2,\\n  n(q,r) = 370 + S(r) − 63q − r/2.\\n- If r is odd (x odd): y_min = 17q + (r+1)/2,\\n  n(q,r) = 370 + S(r) − 63q − (r+1)/2.\\nDefine α(r) so that n(q,r) = α(r) − 63q:\\n- For even r: α(r) = 370 + S(r) − r/2.\\n- For odd r: α(r) = 370 + S(r) − (r+1)/2.\\n\\nCompute S(r) for r = 0,…,33 explicitly, then α(r).
