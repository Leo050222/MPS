  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing number theory equations**\n\nI'm diving into number theory by looking at equations mod 3. I notice that squares mod 3 yield 0 or 1. Now, I want to explore the possibilities for primes while considering 3 or equivalent to ±1. I see I need to represent whether primes are equal to 3. The cases show that either we have one non-3 prime, or all are non-3, leading to some interesting conclusions! I need to check these conditions carefully.**Exploring modular equations**\n\nI need to account for the weighting of 16c² as equivalent to c² mod 3 since 16 is congruent to 1, so our classification still holds. Next, I’ll structure factorization by rearranging the equation and checking mod 4. The squares mod 4 yield 0 or 1, and I see that both a and b must be odd primes, since even this odd square gives a specific outcome. Now, I’m thinking about examining the equation modulo 8 as well!**Analyzing equations and primes**\n\nI’m examining the left-hand side where 1+1-1 equals 1 mod 8, confirming that a and b are odd primes, so their squares equal 1. This makes k² also equal to 1 mod 8, indicating that k is odd. It seems I should interpret the equation in the context of norms or as a sum of two squares representation. I need to consider rearranging it for factorization while keeping in mind the clues about finding a valid solution with small primes. A brute force search might help!**Planning to search for primes**\n\nIt looks like I can't run code directly, but I can use a Python shell to systematically search for prime triples a, b, and c up to a certain bound, along with integer k. Since the default workspace should be safe and isn’t repository-specific, I’m feeling good about this. I'll focus on small primes and keep the numbers manageable. Alright, let's get to searching for those prime triples!**Analyzing prime numbers and equations**\n\nI’m determining whether 151 is a prime number by checking divisibility against primes up to the square root. It seems confirmed that 151 is indeed prime. Then I’m exploring mathematical equations involving k and p but discovering that certain possibilities don’t lead to integers. \n\nNext, I find that the only feasible arrangement involves using 3, leading me to a diophantine equation that’s similar to Pell’s equation. It feels like I've made a key realization about factorization with differences of squares!**Solving equations step-by-step**\n\nI’m working through the equations \\(3k - 4q = d_1\\) and \\(3k + 4q = d_2\\) with their product equal to 17. Since 17 is prime, I explore possible pairs for \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\) but eliminate options leading to negative values. \n\nAdding the equations gives a straightforward solution for \\(k\\) and \\(q\\). After calculations, I validate my solution satisfies the original equations, leading to \\(c = 2\\). Finally, I proceed to find \\(m = c + 288\\), resulting in \\(m = 290\\).**Finding trailing zeros in factorials**\n\nI’m tasked with finding the smallest \\(n\\) such that \\(n!\\) ends with 290 trailing zeros. The count of trailing zeros in \\(n!\\) depends on factors of 2 and 5, but since 5 is limiting, I focus on \\(v_5(n!) = 290\\). This involves using a standard formula where \\(v_5(n!)\\) sums the floor of divisions of \\(n\\) by powers of 5. \n\nNow, I realize that the function steadily increases but... can it skip any integers? If \\(v_5(n_0!) = 288\\), adding 1 for multiples of 5 might not suffice if it’s a multiple of 25, so I need to keep track of contributions carefully!**Examining factorial increments**\n\nI’m revisiting how to determine \\(v_5((n+1)!)\\) based on \\(v_5(n!)\\) and the exponent of 5 in \\(n+1\\). If \\(v_5(n!) = 288\\) and \\(n+1\\) happens to be 25, then \\(v_5(n+1) = 2\\), reaching a total of 290. \n\nI’m considering whether \\(289\\) could exist with some \\(n\\) but want to take a direct approach through arithmetic. We’ll find the smallest \\(n\\) where \\(v_5(n!) \\geq 290\\) and ensure it doesn't skip over 290. It’s possible that some values can indeed be missing, so it’s worth checking.**Finding exact trailing zeros in factorials**\n\nI'm analyzing values of \\(v_5(n!)\\) as I compute the trailing zeros for factorials. I discover that certain values, like \\(5\\), are unattainable, indicating that some values may be skipped entirely in this count. My goal is to find the smallest \\(n\\) such that \\(v_5(n!) = 290\\).\n\nI start with an approximate \\(n\\) and compute \\(v_5(1160!)\\), yielding 288. I realize I need a higher \\(n\\) to achieve 290. Through systematic calculations, I find that \\(1170\\) yields exactly 290 zeros. I’m making sure that there are no smaller \\(n\\) that can lead to the same count!**Confirming minimal n for trailing zeros**\n\nI’m analyzing \\(v_5(n!)\\) to ensure the minimal \\(n\\) with at least 290 trailing zeros is accurately found. Since \\(v_5\\) is a nondecreasing function, earlier values can't exceed 290 if 1170 does. I realize \\(1168\\) had 289, confirming no earlier \\(n\\) contributed 290. Thus, \\(1170\\) is the first instance of exactly 290. \n\nNow I need to prepare a concise JSON output summarizing this reasoning without diving into too much detail. The answer is \\(1170\\).</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Use congruences modulo 3 and 4 to restrict the primes. Mod 3 forces exactly two of a,b,c to be 3, and the remaining one to be a different prime. Trying the cases shows the only viable pattern is a = b = 3 and c ≠ 3. Substituting a = b = 3 into the original equation yields 9k^2 - 16c^2 = 17. Factoring this as (3k - 4c)(3k + 4c) = 17 and using that 17 is prime gives the unique positive solution 3k - 4c = 1 and 3k + 4c = 17, which solves to k = 3 and c = 2. Then m = c + 288 = 2 + 288 = 290. The number of trailing zeros in n! is v_5(n!) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + floor(n/625) + ..., so we need v_5(n!) = 290. Solving this numerically around n ≈ 4m shows v_5(1160!) = 288, v_5(1168!) = 289, and v_5(1170!) = 290, with v_5(n!) strictly increasing or constant in between. Thus the smallest n with exactly 290 trailing zeros is n = 1170.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1170\"\n}",
