Since 23^3 > 2000, only the first two terms matter. This exponent turns out to be 89. We need 23^(6+x) to divide 2000!, so 6 + x ≤ 89, giving the largest positive integer x as 83. For Problem 2, model the expected size of the set of absolute values by indicator variables for each possible absolute value a in {0,1,...,100}. For a > 0, the pair {a, -a} has 2 elements in S; compute the probability that neither member of the pair is chosen in a 50-element subset of a 201-element set and subtract from 1. For a = 0, compute the probability that 0 is chosen. Sum these probabilities over all 101 absolute values using linearity of expectation. Simplifying the resulting combinatorial ratios yields an exact expected value of 8825/201.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"83\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"8825/201\"\n}",
