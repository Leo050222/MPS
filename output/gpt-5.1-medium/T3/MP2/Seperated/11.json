  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing discriminants and bounds**\n\nI'm considering how ab is constrained by the discriminant, where a and b are the roots of a quadratic equation. The discriminant D must be non-negative, leading to the condition that ab should be less than or equal to t²/4. When t is positive, I can make ab very negative, causing s to increase. For t greater than zero, minimal s occurs when ab is maximized within the constraint, and for t less than zero, the opposite is true.**Exploring constraints on ab and s**\n\nI noticed that the coefficient of ab is negative, meaning increasing ab will decrease s. Therefore, to minimize s, I need to maximize ab, but it can't exceed the floor of t²/4, or the discriminant will be negative. When t is negative, the situation flips, as minimal s can occur with minimal ab, leading it towards negative infinity. However, I need to keep s above 2012. There may be some combinations that allow for boundary cases, but ab can also be unboundedly negative under certain conditions.**Assessing the relationship between t and s**\n\nWhen t is less than zero, the equation becomes s = t³ - 63t ab. As ab decreases, I need to analyze the signs of the terms. If I take t as negative, then s becomes -|t|³ + 63|t|ab. If ab approaches negative infinity, s approaches negative infinity too. With fixed negative t, s is an increasing function of ab. Thus, to minimize s for a given t, I want to minimize ab. However, I need s to be at least 2012, suggesting there might be intervals of ab yielding that result for various t values.**Exploring cubic expressions with k**\n\nI'm checking the expression \\(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc\\) by setting \\(c = -60(a+b)\\). I realize that I can rewrite this in terms of \\(c\\) and think about using divisibility properties. If I set \\(c = k(a+b)\\), I can expand it and see how it relates to my original expression. It seems I should choose \\(k\\) to satisfy the equation I’m exploring.\n\nThe goal is to make sure that when I factor, the terms align properly with the additional -60 term. It looks like I want \\(k^3(a^2 + 2ab + b^2) - 3kab\\) to equal -60ab for all integers a and b.**Reassessing polynomial identities**\n\nI've realized that the original polynomial identity can't hold unless the coefficients match, which isn't happening with the \\(a^2\\) term coefficient. So, I explore a different approach by setting \\(c\\) depending on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). I think using \\(S\\) and \\(P\\) from the quadratic equation is helpful. My expression for \\(s\\) simplifies nicely with these parameters. \n\nI can still parametrize it with integer conditions that lead to s being a specific integer, ≥2012. This gives a clearer path forward to finding feasible solutions. My final expression seems workable, and I suspect I can factor it down to a more usable format based on the established relationships!**Exploring polynomial properties**\n\nI'm examining the polynomial expression related to \\(s\\) and its factors. I found that \\(a^2 - 61ab + b^2\\) can be rewritten in terms of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\). This gives me existing forms but leads me to explore \\(s\\) with modular arithmetic, considering moduli like 3, 7, and possibly 9 to analyze potential integer values. \n\nI also plan to check whether multiples of some base arise, especially looking to see if \\(s\\) can never equal certain residues using modular analysis. It’s a journey through algebraic properties to find specific integer solutions that fulfill the original equation. Let's continue this exploration!**Finding minimal polynomial values**\n\nI’m trying to find minimal values of \\(s\\) in a polynomial context while exploring its properties in modular arithmetic. I attempt various fixed values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and check residues across different mod bases like 7, 9, and potentially 13 to see if I can limit possible values for \\(s\\).\n\nFrom my exploration, relating \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) both negatively leads to potential candidates of \\(s\\). The best candidate found so far is \\(2197\\), which seems to fit the requirement of being greater than or equal to 2012. However, I’m still questioning whether this approach might need further adjustments to consider all integer pairs for minimal solutions. Let's refine this further!**Exploring minimal parameters**\n\nI’m trying to analyze the polynomial expression by parameterizing with the greatest common divisor (gcd). I think about scaling values and exploring pairs of coprime integers to identify potential minimal values for \\(s\\). By checking different integer pairs, I realize the smallest absolute value of \\(f_0\\) appears to be 1, leading me to find that scaling \\(g\\) can yield \\(s=2197\\). However, I discover a better candidate \\(s=2187\\) by evaluating the relationship between \\(f_0\\), \\(g\\), and the minimal \\(s\\) that meets our conditions.**Analyzing coprime pairs**\n\nI'm looking at small coprime pairs \\( (a, b) \\) where both \\( |a| \\) and \\( |b| \\) are up to 3. I’ve computed values and identified \\( f_0 \\), which includes \\( 0, 1, 8, 27, 118, 127, \\ldots \\), and now I need to evaluate the minimal \\( s \\) values for \\( f_0 = 8 \\) and \\( 27 \\). \n\nIt's looking like \\( f_0 = 1 \\) gives me \\( 2197 \\), but for \\( f_0 = 6 \\), I can get \\( 2058 \\), which is less than \\( 2197 \\). So, I need to check if there are coprime integers producing \\( f(a, b) = \\pm6 \\) to confirm if \\( 2058 \\) is achievable.**Exploring cubic equations**\n\nI'm considering pairs \\( (a, b) \\) with small values, as \\( f \\mod 7 \\) and \\( f \\mod 9 \\) can help determine potential solutions. I’ve established that \\( f(a,b) \\) cannot equal \\( \\pm 6 \\) based on modulo analysis, which is great since it limits the options for \\( f_0 \\). \n\nThis leaves me with possible minimal values of 1 and some others. I’ve confirmed that \\( 2197 \\) is indeed the minimal \\( s \\). Now, I need to prepare a JSON summarizing the process for both problems clearly and succinctly, ensuring the format is valid and easy to follow.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, rewrite s = a^3 + b^3 - 60ab(a+b) using a = g x, b = g y with gcd(x, y) = 1, giving s = g^3 f(x, y), where f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 60xy(x+y). By modular analysis, f(x, y) ≡ (x+y)^3 (mod 7) and (mod 9), so f(x, y) can only be 0, ±1 (mod 7) and 0, ±1 (mod 9), which excludes small values like ±2, ±3, ±4, ±5, ±6. Checking small coprime pairs shows the smallest positive base value is f(x, y) = 1 (e.g., (1, 0)), so the possible s are perfect cubes g^3. The smallest cube at least 2012 is 13^3 = 2197, and this is achieved by (a, b) = (13, 0). Thus the least s ≥ 2012 is 2197. For Problem 2, let a, b, c be the roots of x^3 + x^2 - 333x - 1001. The elementary symmetric sums are a + b + c = -1, ab + bc + ca = -333, and abc = 1001. Using Newton sums for a cubic, the power sums satisfy P1 = a + b + c = -1, P2 = (a + b + c)P1 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 667, and P3 = (a + b + c)P2 - (ab + bc + ca)P1 + 3abc, giving a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = P3 = 2669.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2197\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"2669\"\n}",
