      "A1054": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours?"

  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Calculating contributions in permutations**\n\nI'm considering a counting method for contributions in permutations. For each permutation, I want to define the contribution as B - X, where X counts the non-a students before the earliest a. If A equals 0, then the contribution is also 0. It’s simpler to compute the probability that there’s at least one 'a' before a fixed non-a student j. I'm summing the indicators to find the expected number. The expected count of non-a students with an earlier a is calculated as B * A / (A + 1), which is useful for determining expected suffering units for antigen a given S.**Finding unconditional expectation**\n\nI'm working through the unconditional expectation for contributions, which is E[contrib(a)] = E[B * A/(A + 1)], considering a random selection S. The students are chosen uniformly, with each having a 1/2 chance of being included in S—that's equivalent to a uniform distribution over all subsets. I realize the inclusion is independent, making A and B follow a Binomial distribution. Therefore, I need to compute E[B * A/(A + 1)], and since A and B are independent, I can separate them for calculation. E[B] turns out to be 64, and now I need to figure out E[A/(A + 1)].**Computing expected values**\n\nI’m aiming to compute E[A/(A + 1)], which can be rephrased as 1 - E[1/(A + 1)]. So, I need to find E[1/(A + 1)] for a Binomial distribution with parameters n = 128 and p = 1/2. There's an identity for this, which seems to check out when verifying for n = 0. Applying it here, I derive E[1/(A + 1)] as [1 - (1/2)^{129}] / (129/2). After simplification, I find E[A/(A + 1)] and ultimately get E[contrib(a)] = 64 * (127 + 2^{-128}) / 129.**Calculating expected suffering across antigens**\n\nI’m calculating the expected total suffering across 8 antigens, which leads me to multiply by 8. That gives me 512 times the earlier derived value. I simplify it down, where 512*127 comes to 65024. Next, I handle the additional tiny fraction from the formula, breaking it down to ensure accuracy. I combine these parts into a single fraction and consider whether I should keep it in its unsimplified form or present it as a rational number. Ultimately, both forms are mathematically valid; I’ll need to check one final detail regarding handling the case when A=0, which seems fine in this context.**Analyzing integer problems and solutions**\n\nI’m reviewing the contribution formula for when A=0, confirming that it leads to the expected value being 512*(127 + 2^{-128})/129. Then, I pivot to a new problem involving three integers, asking what values can lead to results of 42, 13, and 37 from averaging combinations. I establish necessary integer conditions and find that the total sum of the integers must be 46. Assigning integers based on permutations of the results confirms distinct values. \n\nUltimately, the integers derived are 38, -20, and 28, listed as “38,-20,28” for clarity. For the previous numeric expression, I think they might prefer a simplified form like \"512*(127 + 1/2^128)/129\" which maintains exactness while being neat.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to ensure that the JSON output follows the guidelines. The reasoning field can't be a direct rehash of my chain of thought. Instead, I'll summarize it with high-level descriptions for each problem without going into too much detail or revealing intermediate steps. For the first problem, I'll note that I used the linearity of expectation and symmetry to compute the expected contributions, while for the second, I'll outline setting up equations based on the averages. This should keep it concise and appropriate! Now, let's finalize the JSON.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, treat each of the 8 antigens independently and use linearity of expectation. For a fixed antigen, exactly half the students have it and half do not. Each student is independently selected with probability 1/2, and the biting order is random. Compute the expected contribution of one antigen by considering the binomially distributed counts of selected students with and without that antigen, and the probability that a given student without the antigen is bitten after the first student with it. This yields an expectation for one antigen, then multiply by 8 for all antigens.\\n\\nFor Problem 2, label the original integers a, b, c. The three possible results are a+(b+c)/2, b+(a+c)/2, and c+(a+b)/2, which are given as 42, 13, and 37 in some order. Summing these three expressions equals 2(a+b+c), so a+b+c is fixed. Then each original integer can be written in terms of one result and the total sum, leading to a unique multiset of three integers (up to ordering) that produce exactly the given three possible results.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"512*(127+1/2^128)/129\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"38,-20,28\"\n}",
