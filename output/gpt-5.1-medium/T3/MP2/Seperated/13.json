  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Structuring Math Explanation**\n\nI need to summarize the equations. So, starting with subtracting eqA from eqB, I find that \\(a=1\\), then \\(b=0\\) after working through \\(3*1 + b = 3\\). That leads to \\(c=-5\\) since \\(a+b+c=-4\\). So, my final polynomial is \\(R(x) = x^2 - 5\\). \n\nThe user asked for a reasoning string in JSON format without a trailing comma, and while they want step-by-step details, I’ll keep my outline high-level and concise. I'll avoid explicit multi-step operations.**Creating Short Reasoning**\n\nI’m putting together a short reasoning explanation. For problem 1, I’ll denote original squares as \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). Noting that adding 1 to each digit raises the number by 1111 without a carry, I find \\(b^2 - a^2 = 1111\\). After some factorization and checking digit conditions, I settle on \\(n = 2025\\). For problem 2, the divisor is \\((x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\\) and I determine \\(R(x) = x^2 - 5\\) from the quadratic remainder. The final answers are \"2025\" and \"x^2-5\", formatted in JSON.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let the original number be n = a^2 and the digit-wise incremented number be m = b^2. Since all digits of n are at most 5, adding 1 to each digit increases the number by exactly 1111 without carries, so b^2 - a^2 = 1111. Using b^2 - a^2 = (b - a)(b + a), factor 1111 = 1·1111 = 11·101. The pair that yields a 4-digit square for a^2 with digits under 6 is a = 45, giving n = 45^2 = 2025, whose incremented digits give 3136 = 56^2, also a square. So n = 2025.\\n\\nProblem 2: The divisor x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 factors as (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3). The remainder upon division by this cubic is a quadratic R(x) that matches P(x) at x = 1, 2, 3. Given P(1) = -4, P(2) = -1, P(3) = 4, we set R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c and impose R(1) = -4, R(2) = -1, R(3) = 4. Solving this system gives a = 1, b = 0, c = -5, so the remainder is R(x) = x^2 - 5.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2025\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"x^2-5\"\n}",
