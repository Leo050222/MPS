  "math_problem": "Determine all composite positive integers $n$ for which it is possible to arrange all divisors of $n$ that are greater than 1 in a circle so that no two adjacent divisors are relatively prime. Instead of determining all composite positive integers $n$ for which such a circular arrangement exists, simply find $k = \\gcd(p, q) + 1$, where $p$ and $q$ are the distinct prime factors of $n$ in the case where the set of divisors of $n$ greater than 1 has exactly three elements. Let $\\mathbb{N}$ denote the set of positive integers. Find all functions $f : \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that for positive integers $a$ and $b,$ \n\\[f(a^k + b^k) = f(a)f(b) \\text{ and } f(a^k) = f(a)^2.\\]",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first identify composite numbers $ n $ where the set of divisors greater than 1 has exactly three elements. The total number of positive divisors of $ n $ (including 1) must then be 4. Numbers with exactly 4 divisors are either $ p^3 $ (where $ p $ is prime) or $ pq $ (where $ p $ and $ q $ are distinct primes).\\n\\n- For $ n = p^3 $, the divisors greater than 1 are $ \\\\{p, p^2, p^3\\\\} $, but this case has only one distinct prime factor.\\n- For $ n = pq $, the divisors greater than 1 are $ \\\\{p, q, pq\\\\} $, which has exactly two distinct prime factors $ p $ and $ q $.\\n\\nThe problem specifies $ p $ and $ q $ as the **distinct** prime factors of $ n $, so we focus on $ n = pq $. Since $ p $ and $ q $ are distinct primes, $ \\\\gcd(p, q) = 1 $. Thus, $ k = \\\\gcd(p, q) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2\"\n}",
