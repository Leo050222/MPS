Instead of determining all integers at least 2 such that no difference of the specified powered terms between distinct bases up to that integer is divisible by it, simply find $s = k - 1$, where $k$ is the smallest integer at least 2 for which at least one such difference between distinct bases up to $k$ is divisible by $k$. $2020$ positive integers are written in one line. Each of them starting with the $s$-th is divisible by previous and by the sum of two previous numbers. What is the smallest value the last number can take?\n\nA. Gribalko",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the smallest integer $ k \\\\geq 2 $ such that there exist distinct positive integers $ m, n \\\\leq k $ with $ k \\\\mid n^{n-1} - m^{m-1} $. For $ k = 2 $, the only pair is $ (1, 2) $, and $ 2^1 - 1^0 = 1 $, not divisible by 2. For $ k = 3 $, all differences $ 2^1 - 1^0 = 1 $, $ 3^2 - 1^0 = 8 $, $ 3^2 - 2^1 = 7 $ are not divisible by 3. For $ k = 4 $, the pair $ (1, 3) $ gives $ 3^2 - 1^0 = 8 $, which is divisible by 4. Thus, $ k = 4 $ is the smallest such $ k $, so $ s = k - 1 = 3 $.\\n\\nNext, consider a sequence of 2020 positive integers where each term starting from the $ s $-th (i.e., the 3rd term) is divisible by the previous term and by the sum of the two previous terms. To minimize the last term, choose the smallest possible initial terms $ a_1 = 1 $, $ a_2 = 1 $. The conditions imply:\\n- $ a_3 $ must be divisible by $ a_2 = 1 $ and $ a_1 + a_2 = 2 $, so $ a_3 = 2 $.\\n- $ a_4 $ must be divisible by $ a_3 = 2 $ and $ a_2 + a_3 = 3 $, so $ a_4 = 6 $.\\n- $ a_5 $ must be divisible by $ a_4 = 6 $ and $ a_3 + a_4 = 8 $, so $ a_5 = 24 $.\\n\\nThis pattern continues, with $ a_n = (n-1)! $ for $ n \\\\geq 2 $. Verifying the recurrence, each term $ a_i $ is the least common multiple of $ a_{i-1} $ and $ a_{i-2} + a_{i-1} $, which simplifies to $ a_i = (i-1)! $ due to the properties of consecutive integers and factorials. Thus, the 2020th term is $ 2019! $, the smallest possible value satisfying all conditions.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2019!\"\n}",
