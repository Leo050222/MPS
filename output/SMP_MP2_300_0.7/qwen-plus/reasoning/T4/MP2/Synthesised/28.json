Find all functions $f:\\mathbb Z\\rightarrow \\mathbb Z$ such that, for all integers $a,b,c$ that satisfy $a+b+c=k$, the following equality holds:\n\\[f(a)^2+f(b)^2+f(c)^2=2f(a)f(b)+2f(b)f(c)+2f(c)f(a).\\]\n(Here $\\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the set of integers.)",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve for $n$ using the given conditions. We have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1989$ and $a + b + c + d = m^2$, with the largest of $a, b, c, d$ being $n^2$. By testing possible values for the largest number (a perfect square), we find that $36 = 6^2$ works: $36^2 + 18^2 + 15^2 + 12^2 = 1989$ and $36 + 18 + 15 + 12 = 81 = 9^2$. Thus, $n = 6$, so $k = n - 6 = 0$.\\n\\nNext, solve the functional equation for $k = 0$, i.e., for all $a, b, c$ with $a + b + c = 0$: \\n$$\\nf(a)^2 + f(b)^2 + f(c)^2 = 2f(a)f(b) + 2f(b)f(c) + 2f(c)f(a).\\n$$\\nRewriting, this becomes $(f(a) - f(b) - f(c))^2 = 4f(b)f(c)$. Analyzing solutions, we find two families:\\n1. $f(x) = c x^2$ for some integer $c$.\\n2. $f(x) = c$ if $x$ is odd, $0$ if $x$ is even, for some integer $c$.\\n\\nThese are the only solutions satisfying the equation for all $a + b + c = 0$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"all functions f such that f(x) = c x^2 for some integer c, or f(x) = c for odd x and 0 for even x, where c is an integer\"\n}",
