  "math_problem": "Find all prime numbers $ p,q$ less than 2005 and such that $ q|p^2 + 4$, $ p|q^2 + 4$. Instead of identifying all pairs of prime numbers less than 2005 satisfying the divisibility conditions, simply find $k = q - 11$, where $q$ is the prime satisfying $q^2 = \\frac{p^2 + 4}{q'}$ for the ordered pair $(p, q')$ of distinct primes less than 2005 such that $q'$ divides $p^2 + 4$ and $p$ divides ${q'}^2 + 4$. Let real  $a$, $b$, and $c$ satisfy $$abc+a+b+c=ab+bc+ca+5.$$ Find the least possible value of $a^k + b^k + c^2$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, identify the prime pair (p, q') where q' divides p\\u00b2 + 4 and p divides q'\\u00b2 + 4. Through analysis, the valid pair is (29, 5) since 5 divides 29\\u00b2 + 4 = 845 and 29 divides 5\\u00b2 + 4 = 29. Here, q\\u00b2 = (29\\u00b2 + 4)/5 = 169, so q = 13 (prime). Thus, k = q - 11 = 2.\\n\\nNext, solve for the minimum of a\\u207f + b\\u207f + c\\u00b2 with k=2, given abc + a + b + c = ab + bc + ca + 5. Rewrite the equation as (a-1)(b-1)(c-1) = 4. Substitute x = a-1, y = b-1, z = c-1, so xyz = 4. Minimize (x+1)\\u00b2 + (y+1)\\u00b2 + (z+1)\\u00b2.\\n\\nTesting symmetric cases with two negative variables (e.g., x = y = -2, z = 1) gives a = -1, b = -1, c = 2. This satisfies the original equation and yields a\\u00b2 + b\\u00b2 + c\\u00b2 = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6. Calculus confirms this is the minimum, as other configurations yield higher values.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
