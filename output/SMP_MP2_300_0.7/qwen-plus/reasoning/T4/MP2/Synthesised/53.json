Instead of evaluating the interpolating polynomial at the next successive integer beyond the given points, simply find $m = Q(-1) + 1$, where $Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x$ is the auxiliary polynomial of degree $n+1$ that vanishes at $x=0,1,\\ldots,n$. Are there any triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive integers such that $(a-m)(b-m)(c-m) + 12$ is prime that properly divides the positive number $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc - 2017$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the polynomial $ P(x) $ of degree $ n $ satisfying $ P(k) = \\\\frac{k}{k+1} $ for $ k = 0, 1, \\\\ldots, n $. Define the auxiliary polynomial $ Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x $, which vanishes at $ x = 0, 1, \\\\ldots, n $ and has degree $ n+1 $. Thus, $ Q(x) = c x(x-1)\\\\cdots(x-n) $ for some constant $ c $. Evaluating $ Q(-1) $ directly gives:\\n\\n$$\\nQ(-1) = (-1 + 1)P(-1) - (-1) = 1.\\n$$\\n\\nTherefore, $ m = Q(-1) + 1 = 2 $.\\n\\nNext, we examine whether there exist positive integers $ a, b, c $ such that $ (a - m)(b - m)(c - m) + 12 $ is prime and properly divides $ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc - 2017 $. Substituting $ m = 2 $, this becomes:\\n\\n- $ d = (a - 2)(b - 2)(c - 2) + 12 $ must be prime,\\n- $ N = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc - 2017 $ must be positive,\\n- $ d $ must divide $ N $ with $ 1 < d < N $.\\n\\nExtensive case analysis shows that when $ d $ is prime, $ N $ is typically negative or $ d > N $, violating the condition $ 1 < d < N $. For example:\\n- If $ a = 3, b = 3, c = 3 $, then $ d = 13 $, but $ N = -1963 $ (negative).\\n- If $ a = 12, b = 12, c = 12 $, then $ N = 143 $, but $ d = 1012 $ (not prime and $ d > N $).\\n- When $ N $ is positive (e.g., $ a = 12, b = 12, c = 13 $), $ d $ is not prime or does not divide $ N $.\\n\\nAll valid combinations either result in $ N \\\\leq 0 $, $ d $ not being prime, or $ d \\\\geq N $, so no triple satisfies all conditions.\",\n    \"answer\": \"No\"\n}",
