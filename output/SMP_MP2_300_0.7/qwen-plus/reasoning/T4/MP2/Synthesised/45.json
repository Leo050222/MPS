  "math_problem": "Find the number of triples of sets $(A, B, C)$ such that: (a) $A, B, C \\subseteq\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 8\\}$. (b) $|A \\cap B|=|B \\cap C|=|C \\cap A|=2$. (c) $|A|=|B|=|C|=4$. Here, $|S|$ denotes the number of elements in the set $S$. Instead of determining the total number of such triples of sets, simply find $m = |A \\cap B \\cap C|$, where $|A \\cap B \\cap C|$ is the size of the triple intersection derived from the structural consideration of configurations with no elements belonging to exactly two of the sets. Compute the number of ways there are to assemble $m$ red unit cubes and $25$ white unit cubes into a $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ cube such that red is visible on exactly 4 faces of the larger cube. (Rotations and reflections are considered distinct.)",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine $ m = |A \\\\cap B \\\\cap C| $ under the given constraints:\\n\\n- $ A, B, C \\\\subseteq \\\\{1, 2, \\\\dots, 8\\\\} $\\n- $ |A| = |B| = |C| = 4 $\\n- $ |A \\\\cap B| = |B \\\\cap C| = |C \\\\cap A| = 2 $\\n- No elements belong to exactly two of the sets.\\n\\nUnder this condition, all pairwise intersections must be equal to the triple intersection. Since $ |A \\\\cap B| = 2 $ and there are no elements in exactly two sets, it follows that $ |A \\\\cap B \\\\cap C| = 2 $. Thus, $ m = 2 $.\\n\\nNext, we compute the number of ways to assemble 2 red unit cubes and 25 white unit cubes into a $ 3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 3 $ cube such that red is visible on exactly 4 faces (rotations and reflections are considered distinct).\\n\\nEach red cube contributes to the visibility of certain faces depending on its position:\\n- Corner: visible on 3 faces\\n- Edge center: visible on 2 faces\\n- Face center: visible on 1 face\\n- Interior: not visible on any face\\n\\nWe consider all pairs of surface positions (since interior positions cannot contribute to face visibility) where the union of their visible faces has size exactly 4. The valid configurations are:\\n\\n1. **Two adjacent corners** (sharing an edge): 12 such pairs\\n2. **One corner and one edge center sharing exactly one face**: 48 such pairs\\n3. **One corner and one face center on opposite faces**: 24 such pairs\\n4. **Two edge centers with disjoint face sets**: 30 such pairs\\n\\nSumming these gives $ 12 + 48 + 24 + 30 = 114 $ valid configurations.\", \"answer\": \"114\"}",
