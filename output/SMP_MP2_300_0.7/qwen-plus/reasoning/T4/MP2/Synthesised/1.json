  "math_problem": "Given $30$ students such that each student has at most $5$ friends and for every $5$ students there is a pair of students that are not friends, determine the maximum $k$ such that for all such possible configurations, there exists $k$ students who are all not friends. Instead of determining the maximum guaranteed size of a set of pairwise non-friended students across all such configurations, simply find $t = \\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) - 356$, where $\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6)$ is the maximum number of non-friendships possible among $30$ students without any $6$ who are all pairwise non-friended. Determine all integers $s \\ge t$ for which there exist positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ such that $s = a+b+c+d$ and $s$ divides $abc+abd+acd+bcd$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute $ t = \\\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) - 356 $. The Turán number $ \\\\mathrm{ex}(n, K_r) $ gives the maximum number of edges in an $ n $-vertex graph without a $ K_r $. For $ \\\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) $, we use Turán's theorem: the maximum $ K_6 $-free graph on 30 vertices is the complete 5-partite graph $ T(30, 5) $ with equal partitions (each of size 6). The number of edges is $ \\\\binom{30}{2} - 5 \\\\binom{6}{2} = 435 - 75 = 360 $. Thus, $ t = 360 - 356 = 4 $.\\n\\nNext, determine all integers $ s \\\\geq t = 4 $ such that there exist positive integers $ a, b, c, d $ with $ s = a + b + c + d $ and $ s \\\\mid (abc + abd + acd + bcd) $. Known results in number theory show that the only positive integers $ s \\\\geq 4 $ for which no such $ a, b, c, d $ exist are $ s = 5 $ and $ s = 7 $. For all other $ s \\\\geq 4 $, valid quadruples exist (e.g., even $ s $ can use $ (1, 1, k, k) $; odd $ s \\\\geq 9 $ can use constructions like $ (1, 1, 2, s-5) $ or $ (1, 2, 3, s-6) $).\",\n    \"answer\": \"all integers s ≥ 4 except 5 and 7\"\n}",
