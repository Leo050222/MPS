  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We are given four positive integers $a, b, c, d$ such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1989$, their sum is a perfect square $m^2$, and the largest of them is $n^2$. The goal is to find $k = n - 6$.  \\n\\nFirst, since the sum of squares is 1989, the largest number $L = n^2$ must satisfy $L^2 \\\\leq 1989$, so $L \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{1989} \\\\approx 44.6$. Since $L = n^2$, possible values for $n$ are 1 through 6 (as $7^2 = 49 > 44.6$). Thus, $L \\\\in \\\\{1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36\\\\}$.\\n\\nTesting the largest possible $L = 36$ (i.e., $n = 6$):  \\n- Remaining sum of squares: $1989 - 36^2 = 1989 - 1296 = 693$.  \\n- Let the other three numbers be $x, y, z$, so $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 693$ and $x + y + z = m^2 - 36$.  \\n- The total sum $S = 36 + x + y + z = m^2$ must be between $36 + 3 = 39$ and $36 + 3 \\\\times 36 = 144$, so $m^2 \\\\in \\\\{64, 81\\\\}$ (since $7^2 = 49 < 39$).\\n\\nFor $m^2 = 81$: $x + y + z = 45$. Using the identity $(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)$, we get $45^2 = 693 + 2Q \\\\Rightarrow Q = 666$. Solving for $x, y, z$, we find $x = 12$, $y = 15$, $z = 18$ (or permutations), which satisfy $12^2 + 15^2 + 18^2 = 693$ and $12 + 15 + 18 = 45$. Thus, the numbers are $12, 15, 18, 36$, with sum $81 = 9^2$ (so $m = 9$) and largest number $36 = 6^2$ (so $n = 6$).  \\n\\nChecking smaller $L$ values (e.g., $L = 25$) leads to contradictions or no valid solutions. Hence, $n = 6$, so $k = n - 6 = 0$.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need to find all functions $f: \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z}$ such that for all $a, b, c$ with $a + b + c = 0$,  \\n$$\\nf(a)^2 + f(b)^2 + f(c)^2 = 2f(a)f(b) + 2f(b)f(c) + 2f(c)f(a).\\n$$\\n\\nRewriting the equation:  \\n$$\\n(f(a) - f(b) - f(c))^2 = 4f(b)f(c).\\n$$\\nSetting $a = b = c = 0$ gives $3f(0)^2 = 6f(0)^2 \\\\Rightarrow f(0) = 0$. Setting $b = 0$ (so $c = -a$) shows $f$ is even ($f(a) = f(-a)$).  \\n\\nFor $b = a$, $c = -2a$, we get $f(2a)(f(2a) - 4f(a)) = 0$. Assuming $f(a) \\\\neq 0$, induction shows $f(n) = kn^2$ for some integer $k$. Verifying, $f(n) = kn^2$ satisfies the equation:  \\n$$\\nk^2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) = 2k^2(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2a^2),\\n$$\\nwhich holds because $a + b + c = 0 \\\\Rightarrow a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = 2(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2a^2)$.  \\n\\nThe zero function ($k = 0$) is included. No other solutions exist, as shown by testing parity-based functions and finding contradictions unless $k = 0$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(n) = k n^2 for some integer k\"\n}",
