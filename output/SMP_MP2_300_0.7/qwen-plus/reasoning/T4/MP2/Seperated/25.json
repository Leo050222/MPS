  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: By setting x=0 in the functional equation, we derive f(g(y)) = f(0) + y for all y. Using the condition f(0) + g(0) = 0, we let c = f(0), so g(0) = -c. Substituting y=0 into the derived equation gives f(-c) = c. Assuming linearity (common in functional equations), we test f(t) = mt + c and find that m=1 and c=0 satisfy all conditions. Thus, f(0) = 0, so b=0 and k = 0 + 2 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Testing constant functions, f=0 works. For linear functions f(y)=ay+b, solving coefficients shows a=0 (f=0) or a=2 (f(y)=2y). Verifying both in the original equation confirms they are solutions. Further analysis shows no other solutions exist, as non-linear or mixed cases lead to contradictions. Thus, the solutions are f(x)=0 and f(x)=2x for all x.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = 0 and f(x) = 2x\"\n}",
