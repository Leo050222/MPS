By analyzing degrees and leading coefficients, for non-constant polynomials (which are the primary focus as constant pairs like $(1,1)$ lead to $T=3$ but are trivial), the leading terms of $P^2 + Q^2 + 1$ (degree $2d$) and $PQT$ (degree $2d$) imply $T=2$. This is confirmed by constructing explicit examples (e.g., $P = Q + i$) where $T=2$ holds universally for non-constant valid pairs. The problem specifies finding $T$ derived from divisibility conditions, which consistently yields $T=2$ for non-trivial cases.\\n\\nProblem 2: For positive integers $n$, we need $k \\\\geq 2$ positive rationals summing and multiplying to $n$. By AM-GM inequality, primes $n \\\\geq 2$ fail (as $n/k < n^{1/k}$ for $k \\\\geq 2$). Composite $n \\\\geq 4$ work: for $n = d_1 d_2$ ($d_1, d_2 \\\\geq 2$), use $(n - d_1 - d_2)$ copies of 1, $d_1$, and $d_2$ (e.g., $n=4$: $[2,2]$; $n=6$: $[1,2,3]$). Exceptions are $n=1,2,3,5,7$ (primes or too small), but all composites $n \\\\geq 4$ satisfy the condition.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"all composite integers greater than or equal to 4\"\n}",
