By Fermat's Little Theorem and the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $ n $ must be square-free and its prime factors $ p $ must satisfy $ p - 1 \\\\mid 12 $. The primes $ p $ with $ p - 1 \\\\mid 12 $ are $ 2, 3, 5, 7, 13 $. The number of non-empty subsets of these primes (since $ n > 1 $) is $ 2^5 - 1 = 31 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"31\"\n}",
