      "A390": "Two players, $B$ and $R$ , play the following game on an infinite grid of unit squares, all initially colored white. The players take turns starting with $B$ . On $B$ 's turn, $B$ selects one white unit square and colors it blue. On $R$ 's turn, $R$ selects two white unit squares and colors them red. The players alternate until $B$ decides to end the game. At this point, $B$ gets a score, given by the number of unit squares in the largest (in terms of area) simple polygon containing only blue unit squares. What is the largest score $B$ can guarantee?\n(A simple polygon is a polygon (not necessarily convex) that does not intersect itself and has no holes.) Instead of determining the largest score $B$ can guarantee, simply find $m = |P_i| - 2$, where $|P_i|$ is the number of unit squares in each of the disjoint $2 \\times 2$ blocks into which the grid is partitioned to analyze the connectivity of blue squares."

However, due to R's optimal play (placing two red squares per turn), B can guarantee at most 2 blue squares per 2x2 block. Thus, |P_i| = 2, leading to m = |P_i| - 2 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: By setting y = xa and z = xb with gcd(a, b) = 1, the equation simplifies to b = x(a² + x)/(x²a - 1). Analyzing small values of x:\\n- For x = 1, valid (a, b) pairs are (2, 5) and (3, 5), yielding solutions (1, 2, 5) and (1, 3, 5).\\n- For x = 2, valid (a, b) pairs are (1, 2) and (3, 2), yielding solutions (2, 2, 4) and (2, 6, 4).\\nNo solutions exist for x ≥ 3.
