  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We need to find consecutive positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that both fractions are integers. Assuming $b = a + 1$, the first fraction simplifies to 1 for any $a$. Checking small values, $(a, b) = (1, 2)$ and $(2, 3)$ work. For $(2, 3)$, the first fraction is 1, and the second is 11 (both integers). Similarly, $(3, 2)$ gives the first fraction as 11. However, the problem specifies $k$ as the value of $\\\\frac{a^2 + b}{b^2 - a}$ for consecutive pairs. For consecutive pairs where $b = a + 1$ (e.g., $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 3)$), this value is always 1. Thus, $k = 1$, so $e = 1 + 2022 = 2023$.\\n\\nProblem 2: $d$ is the gcd of $P(n)$ for all $n > 2023$. $d$ is the product of primes $p$ where the cube map modulo $p$ is surjective (i.e., $\\\\gcd(3, p-1) = 1$). These primes $\\\\leq 40$ are 2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 23, 29. The exponent of each prime $p$ in $d$ is $\\\\lfloor 40/p \\\\rfloor$. Summing these exponents: $20 + 13 + 8 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 48$. Thus, $m = 48$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2023\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"48\"\n}",
