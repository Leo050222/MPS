Testing $ k=2 $: only pair (1,2) gives $ 2^1 - 1^0 = 1 \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2} $. For $ k=3 $: pairs (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) yield differences 1, 8, 7, none divisible by 3. For $ k=4 $: pair (1,3) gives $ 3^2 - 1^0 = 8 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{4} $. Thus $ k=4 $ is the smallest, so $ s = k - 1 = 3 $. Problem 2: The sequence starts with $ a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1 $. Each subsequent term $ a_n $ (for $ n \\\\geq 3 $) must be divisible by $ a_{n-1} $ and $ a_{n-2} + a_{n-1} $. The minimal such $ a_n $ is $ \\\\text{LCM}(a_{n-1}, a_{n-2} + a_{n-1}) $. This yields $ a_n = (n-1)! $. For 2020 terms, the last term is $ a_{2020} = 2019! $, which is the smallest possible.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2019!\"\n}",
