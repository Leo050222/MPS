The left-hand side becomes $ f(0^3 + 1^3 + 0 \\\\cdot 1) = f(1) $. The right-hand side becomes $ 0^2 f(0) + 1^2 f(1) + f(0 \\\\cdot 1) = f(1) + f(0) $. Equating both sides gives $ f(1) = f(1) + f(0) $, so $ f(0) = 0 $. Thus, $ k = 0 + 1 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a sequence where every 7 consecutive terms sum to positive and every 11 consecutive terms sum to negative, the maximal length is determined by avoiding contradictions in overlapping sums. For $ N = 17 $, summing all 7-term and 11-term sums leads to a contradiction (positive sum equals negative sum). For $ N = 16 $, no such contradiction arises, and it is possible to construct such a sequence. Hence, the maximal length is 16.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"16\"\n}",
