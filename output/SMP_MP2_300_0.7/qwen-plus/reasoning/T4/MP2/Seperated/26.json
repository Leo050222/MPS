We need to find distinct positive integers $s_1, \\\\ldots, s_n$ such that $\\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{s_i}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{17}{670}$. This is equivalent to $\\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{s_i - 1}{s_i} = \\\\frac{17}{670}$, or $\\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{s_i}{s_i - 1} = \\\\frac{670}{17}$. By analyzing the equation $\\\\prod \\\\frac{s_i}{s_i - 1} = \\\\frac{670}{17}$, we find that the minimal set includes numbers from 2 to 39 (38 numbers), plus 120 and 469. The maximum element in this set is 469. Thus, $d = 469 - 67 = 402$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The polynomial $P(x, y)$ must be homogeneous of degree $n$, satisfy $P(a+b, c) + P(b+c, a) + P(c+a, b) = 0$ for all $a, b, c$, and $P(1, 0) = 1$. By testing small degrees and generalizing, we find that $P(x, y) = (x - 2y)(x + y)^{n-1}$ satisfies all conditions for any positive integer $n$. This form is unique due to the constraints, as shown by verifying homogeneity, the functional equation, and the initial condition.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"402\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"P(x, y) = (x - 2y)(x + y)^{n-1}\"\n}",
