  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The equation given is $4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1$. Rearranging gives $4b^2 = 3a^2 + 1$, so $3a^2 + 1$ must be divisible by 4. This implies $a^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 4$, so $a$ must be odd. Testing odd integers greater than 1: for $a = 15$, $3(15)^2 + 1 = 676$, which gives $b^2 = 169$ (so $b = 13$). Thus, $a = 15$ is the smallest such integer greater than 1. Therefore, $d = a - 14 = 15 - 14 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given $z^5 + 2004z = 1$, we need $P(z^2) = 0$ where $P$ is degree 5. The ratio $P(1)/P(-1)$ is computed using products over roots. $P(1) = \\\\prod (1 - z_i^2) = 2004 \\\\times 2006 = 2005^2 - 1$, and $P(-1) = \\\\prod (-1 - z_i^2) = -\\\\prod (1 + z_i^2) = -(2005^2 + 1)$. Thus, $P(1)/P(-1) = -(2005^2 - 1)/(2005^2 + 1) = -2010012/2010013$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-2010012/2010013\"\n}",
