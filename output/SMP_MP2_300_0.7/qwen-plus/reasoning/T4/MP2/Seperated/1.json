Instead of determining the maximum guaranteed size of a set of pairwise non-friended students across all such configurations, simply find $t = \\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) - 356$, where $\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6)$ is the maximum number of non-friendships possible among $30$ students without any $6$ who are all pairwise non-friended."

By Turán's theorem, this is achieved by the complete 5-partite graph $T(30, 5)$ with equal partitions (each of size 6). The number of edges is $\\\\frac{1}{2}(30^2 - 5 \\\\cdot 6^2) = 360$. Thus, $t = 360 - 356 = 4$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For $s \\\\geq 4$, we need $s = a + b + c + d$ and $s \\\\mid (abc + abd + acd + bcd)$. Analysis shows that for prime $s \\\\geq 5$, no such positive integers $a, b, c, d$ exist due to modular constraints. However, for composite $s \\\\geq 4$, constructions (e.g., using symmetric partitions or geometric progressions) always yield valid solutions. Thus, the valid $s$ are all integers $\\\\geq 4$ that are not prime.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"all integers s ≥ 4 that are not prime\"\n}",
