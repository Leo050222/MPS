Instead of finding the floor of the product of the next successive integer and the value of $P$ evaluated at that integer, simply find $d = Q(0) + 5$, where $Q(x) = x^{2} P(x) - 1$ is the auxiliary polynomial derived from the given interpolation condition."

Since P(n) = 1/n² for n = 1, ..., 2016, Q(n) = 0 for these n, making Q(x) a degree 2017 polynomial with roots at 1, ..., 2016. However, Q(0) = 0²P(0) - 1 = -1 directly from the definition of Q(x), regardless of P(0). Thus, d = Q(0) + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let roots be a, b, c, d with ab = -32. By Vieta's formulas: a+b+c+d = 18, abcd = -1984 ⇒ cd = (-1984)/(-32) = 62. Sum of products three at a time: abc + abd + acd + bcd = -200 ⇒ ab(c+d) + cd(a+b) = -200. Let S = a+b, T = c+d (S+T=18). Then -32T + 62S = -200. Substituting T = 18 - S gives -32(18 - S) + 62S = -200 ⇒ 94S = 376 ⇒ S = 4, T = 14. Then k = ab + cd + (a+b)(c+d) = -32 + 62 + 4*14 = 86.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"86\"\n}",
