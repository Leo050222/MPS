This implies $ \\\\gcd(r, m) = 1 $, so $ k = \\\\gcd(r, m) + 1 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: By substituting specific values (e.g., $ x = 0 $, $ y = 0 $) and analyzing functional equations, we find $ f(0) = 0 $. Further substitutions and polynomial analysis show that the only solutions are the zero function and $ f(x) = x^2 $. Verification confirms both satisfy the given equation.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x^2\"\n}",
