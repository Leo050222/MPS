By analyzing the commuting condition, it is derived that $ q(x) = 6 - p(x) $. Substituting into the functional equation $ p(6 - y) + p(y) = 6 $, the coefficients of $ p(x) $ are constrained. Evaluating $ p(3) $ and $ q(6) $ using the derived form of $ p(x) $ shows that $ p(3) = 3 $ and $ q(6) = -24 $ regardless of the leading coefficient $ a $, due to cancellation of terms.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(3, -24)\"\n}",
