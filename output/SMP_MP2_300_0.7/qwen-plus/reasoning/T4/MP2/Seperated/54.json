All three methods of transportation are used in the county with no community being serviced by all three modes and no three communities being linked pairwise by the same mode. Determine the largest number of communities in this county. Instead of determining the largest number of communities in this county, simply find $k = c(uv) - 2$, where $c(uv)$ is the label of the mode of transportation linking two communities both serviced only by the modes labeled 1 and 3."

Communities serviced only by modes 1 and 3 (Type B vertices) must have their connecting edge colored 3 to avoid monochromatic triangles with Type C vertices. Thus, c(uv) = 3, so k = 3 - 2 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: By setting x = 1, we find f(1) = 1. Using y = f(x), we derive f(x) ≤ x. From x = 1 inequality, f(y) ≥ y. Combining these gives f(y) = y for all y, which satisfies the original inequality as equality.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = x\"\n}",
