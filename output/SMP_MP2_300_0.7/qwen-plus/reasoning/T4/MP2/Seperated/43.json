Using the Law of Sines, side $b = CA = 4 \\\\sin B$. Since $\\\\angle ABC \\\\geq 90^\\\\circ$, $B \\\\in [90^\\\\circ, 180^\\\\circ)$, so $\\\\sin B \\\\leq 1$, implying $b \\\\leq 4$. The maximum chord length in a circle of radius 2 is the diameter (4), achieved when $B = 90^\\\\circ$ (Thales' theorem). For $B > 90^\\\\circ$, $b < 4$, but the quartic equation $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + 1 = 0$ (with $a=BC, b=CA, c=AB$) has no real roots due to contradictions in discriminant analysis and chord length constraints. Only when $b = 4$ (right-angled at $B$) does the quartic admit real roots. Thus, $b = 4$, so $k = b + 2013 = 2017$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Count ordered arrays $(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_{100})$ with $x_i \\\\in \\\\{1, \\\\ldots, 2017\\\\}$ satisfying $2017 \\\\mid \\\\sum x_i$ and $2017 \\\\mid \\\\sum x_i^2$. Let $p = 2017$ (prime). Using character sums and properties of quadratic Gauss sums, the number of solutions is $p^{n-2}$ for $n$ variables. Here, $n = 100$, so the count is $2017^{98}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2017\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2017^98\"\n}",
