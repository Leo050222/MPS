  "math_problem": "Let $n=2000$ and $p=23$. The exponent of $p$ in $n!$ is $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\lfloor n / p^k \\rfloor$. Find the greatest positive integer $x$ such that $p^{6+x}$ divides $n!$. Instead of determining the largest additional exponent beyond 6 for which the prime power divides the factorial, simply find $m = \\lfloor n / p \\rfloor - 36$, where $\\lfloor n / p \\rfloor$ is the first term in the sum for the exponent of $p$ in $n!$. Let $S=\\{-100,-99,-98, \\ldots, 99,100\\}$. Choose a $m$-element subset $T$ of $S$ at random. Find the expected number of elements of the set $\\{|x|: x \\in T\\}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute $ m = \\\\lfloor 2000 / 23 \\\\rfloor - 36 $. Since $ 23 \\\\times 86 = 1978 $, $ \\\\lfloor 2000 / 23 \\\\rfloor = 86 $, so $ m = 86 - 36 = 50 $. The set $ S = \\\\{-100, -99, \\\\ldots, 99, 100\\\\} $ has 201 elements. To find the expected number of distinct absolute values in a random 50-element subset $ T $, use linearity of expectation. For absolute value 0 (only element 0), the probability it is in $ T $ is $ 50/201 $. For each $ k = 1 $ to $ 100 $, the probability at least one of $ k $ or $ -k $ is in $ T $ is $ 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\binom{199}{50}}{\\\\binom{201}{50}} = 1 - \\\\frac{151 \\\\times 150}{201 \\\\times 200} = \\\\frac{117}{268} $. Summing these contributions: $ \\\\frac{50}{201} + 100 \\\\times \\\\frac{117}{268} = \\\\frac{8825}{201} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"8825/201\"\n}",
