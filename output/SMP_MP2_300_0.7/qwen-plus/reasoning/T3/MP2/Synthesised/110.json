  "math_problem": "Find all triples of primes $(p,q,r)$ satisfying $3p^{4}-5q^{4}-4r^{2}=26$. Instead of determining all triples of primes that satisfy the given Diophantine equation, simply find $m = r - 16$, where $r$ is the prime in the solution triple. Triangle $A B C$ has perimeter 1. Its three altitudes form the side lengths of a triangle. Find the set of all possible values of $\\min (A B, B C, C A)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we analyze the Diophantine equation $3p^4 - 5q^4 - 4r^2 = 26$ where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are primes. Since fourth powers grow rapidly, we test small prime values for $q$ first.\\n\\n- **Case $q = 2$:**  \\n  $q^4 = 16$, so the equation becomes $3p^4 - 4r^2 = 106$. Testing $p = 2$ gives $3(16) = 48$, which leads to a negative $r^2$, invalid. Larger $p$ values also fail due to mismatched parity or non-square results.\\n\\n- **Case $q = 3$:**  \\n  $q^4 = 81$, so the equation becomes $3p^4 - 4r^2 = 431$. Testing $p = 5$:  \\n  $3(625) = 1875$, so $4r^2 = 1875 - 431 = 1444 \\\\Rightarrow r^2 = 361 \\\\Rightarrow r = 19$, which is prime. Verifying:  \\n  $3(5^4) - 5(3^4) - 4(19^2) = 1875 - 405 - 1444 = 26$, valid.\\n\\n- **Larger $q$:**  \\n  For $q \\\\geq 5$, $5q^4$ becomes too large, making $3p^4$ insufficient to satisfy the equation without resulting in non-integer or non-prime $r$.\\n\\nThe only solution is $(p, q, r) = (5, 3, 19)$. Thus, $r = 19$, and $m = r - 16 = 3$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
