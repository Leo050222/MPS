  "math_problem": "I have 8 unit cubes of different colors, which I want to glue together into a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ cube. How many distinct $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ cubes can I make? Rotations of the same cube are not considered distinct, but reflections are. Instead of determining the number of distinct assemblies up to rotational symmetry, simply find $m = \\binom{7}{3}$, where $m$ is the number of ways to choose three of the remaining seven cubes for the three positions that share a face with the fixed cube. The number $$m + 316990099009866=\\\\frac{32016000000000001}{101}$$ is the product of two distinct prime numbers. Compute the smaller of these two primes.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, calculate $ m = \\\\binom{7}{3} = 35 $. Then, compute $ m + 316990099009866 = 35 + 316990099009866 = 316990099009901 $. The problem states this equals $ \\\\frac{32016000000000001}{101} $, which is verified by multiplication. Next, factor $ 316990099009901 $. Testing divisibility by small primes, we find $ 316990099009901 = 73 \\\\times 4342329986437 $. Since the problem specifies it is the product of two distinct primes and 73 is smaller than 4342329986437, the smaller prime is 73.\",\n    \"answer\": \"73\"\n}",
