  "math_problem": "Let $a, b$ be positive reals with $a>b>\\frac{1}{2} a$. Place two squares of side lengths $a, b$ next to each other, such that the larger square has lower left corner at $(0,0)$ and the smaller square has lower left corner at $(a, 0)$. Draw the line passing through $(0, a)$ and $(a+b, 0)$. The region in the two squares lying above the line has area 2013. If $(a, b)$ is the unique pair maximizing $a+b$, compute $\\frac{a}{b}$. Instead of computing $\\frac{a}{b}$ for the unique pair maximizing $a + b$, simply find $\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is the value of $\\frac{(a + b)^2}{a^2 - a b + 2 b^2}$ for that pair. Find the real solution(s) to the equation $(x+y)^{\\lambda - 2/7}=(x+1)(y-1)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, we determine the equation of the line passing through (0, a) and (a + b, 0), which is $ y = -\\\\frac{a}{a + b}x + a $. The area above this line within the two squares is calculated by integrating the region above the line in both squares. Simplifying the total area expression, we find it equals $ \\\\frac{a^2 - ab + 2b^2}{2} = 2013 $, leading to $ a^2 - ab + 2b^2 = 4026 $.\\n\\nTo maximize $ a + b $ under the constraint $ a > b > \\\\frac{1}{2}a $, we set $ t = \\\\frac{a}{b} $ (so $ 1 < t < 2 $) and rewrite the constraint as $ b^2(t^2 - t + 2) = 4026 $. Maximizing $ a + b = b(t + 1) $ is equivalent to maximizing $ \\\\frac{(t + 1)^2}{t^2 - t + 2} $. Taking the derivative and solving, we find the maximum occurs at $ t = \\\\frac{5}{3} $.\\n\\nSubstituting $ t = \\\\frac{5}{3} $, we compute $ \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{(a + b)^2}{a^2 - ab + 2b^2} = \\\\frac{16}{7} $. The equation $ (x + y)^{\\\\lambda - 2/7} = (x + 1)(y - 1) $ simplifies to $ (x + y)^2 = (x + 1)(y - 1) $. Rearranging and completing the square shows the only real solution is $ x = -1 $, $ y = 1 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(-1, 1)\"\n}",
