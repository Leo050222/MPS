  "math_problem": "In a $k \\times k$ chessboard, a set $S$ of 25 cells that are in a $5 \\times 5$ square is chosen uniformly at random. The probability that there are more black squares than white squares in $S$ is $48\\%$. Find $k$. Instead of determining the dimension of the board, simply find $b = n - 3$, where $n$ is the number of possible starting positions along one dimension for the subsquare derived from the positional analysis of the board. Find all ordered pairs of integers $(x, y)$ such that $3^{x} 4^{y}=b^{x+y}+b^{2(x+y)-1}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the number of starting positions $ n $ for a $ 5 \\\\times 5 $ square on a $ k \\\\times k $ chessboard. The number of such positions along one dimension is $ n = k - 4 $. The probability that a randomly chosen $ 5 \\\\times 5 $ square has more black squares than white squares is given as 48%. On a standard chessboard, a $ 5 \\\\times 5 $ square has 13 black and 12 white squares if the top-left corner has even parity (i.e., $ i + j $ even), or vice versa. The probability depends on the parity distribution of the top-left corners. For $ n \\\\times n $ top-left positions, the number of even parity corners is $ \\\\frac{n^2 + 1}{2} $ if $ n $ is odd, and $ \\\\frac{n^2}{2} $ if $ n $ is even. Given the probability is 48% (less than 50%), $ n $ must be odd, and the minority parity (odd $ i + j $) corresponds to more black squares. Solving $ \\\\frac{12}{25} = 0.48 $, we find $ n^2 = 25 $, so $ n = 5 $. Thus, $ b = n - 3 = 2 $.\\n\\nNext, solve $ 3^x 4^y = 2^{x+y} + 2^{2(x+y)-1} $. Let $ s = x + y $. The equation becomes $ 3^x 4^y = 2^s + 2^{2s - 1} $. Testing small integer values:\\n- For $ s = 1 $: $ 3^0 4^1 = 4 $, RHS = $ 2^1 + 2^1 = 4 $ → solution $ (0, 1) $.\\n- For $ s = 2 $: $ 3^1 4^1 = 12 $, RHS = $ 2^2 + 2^3 = 12 $ → solution $ (1, 1) $.\\n- For $ s = 4 $: $ 3^2 4^2 = 144 $, RHS = $ 2^4 + 2^7 = 144 $ → solution $ (2, 2) $.\\nNo other integer solutions exist after checking all cases.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(0,1),(1,1),(2,2)\"\n}",
