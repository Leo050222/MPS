  "math_problem": "Find all prime numbers $p,q,r$ , such that $\\frac{p}{q}-\\frac{4}{r+1}=1$ Instead of finding all prime numbers $p,q,r$ satisfying the given equation, simply find $n = r + 2009$, where $r$ is the prime number such that $r + 1$ equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term. FemtoPravis is walking on an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard that wraps around at its edges (so squares on the left edge of the chessboard are adjacent to squares on the right edge, and similarly for the top and bottom edges). Each femtosecond, FemtoPravis moves in one of the four diagonal directions uniformly at random. After $n$ femtoseconds, what is the probability that FemtoPravis is at his original location?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding primes $p, q, r$ such that $\\\\frac{p}{q} - \\\\frac{4}{r+1} = 1$, but instead focuses on determining $n = r + 2009$ where $r + 1$ equals the numerator of the subtracted term $\\\\frac{4}{r+1}$. The numerator of $\\\\frac{4}{r+1}$ is 4, so $r + 1 = 4 \\\\implies r = 3$. Although $r = 3$ does not yield valid primes $p, q$ (as $\\\\frac{p}{q} = 2$ implies $p = 2q$, and $q = 2$ gives $p = 4$, which is not prime), the problem explicitly instructs to use $r = 3$ based on the numerator condition. Thus, $n = 3 + 2009 = 2012$.\\n\\nNext, consider FemtoPravis's movement on an $8 \\\\times 8$ toroidal chessboard. Each move changes $(x, y)$ by $(\\\\pm 1, \\\\pm 1)$, so after $n$ steps, $x$ and $y$ displacements have the same parity as $n$. Since $n = 2012$ is even, $x$ and $y$ must be even modulo 8. The valid states for $(x, y)$ are those where both coordinates are even (0, 2, 4, 6 mod 8), giving $4 \\\\times 4 = 16$ states. For large $n$, the walk becomes uniformly distributed over these states due to symmetry and ergodicity. Thus, the probability of being at the origin $(0, 0)$ is $\\\\frac{1}{16}$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/16\"\n}",
