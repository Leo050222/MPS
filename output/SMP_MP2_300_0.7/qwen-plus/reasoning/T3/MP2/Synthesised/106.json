  "math_problem": "The altitudes of a triangle are $12$, $15$, and $20$.  What is the area of this triangle? Instead of finding the area of the triangle, simply find $k = x - 3$, where $x$ is the scaling factor such that the side lengths are $5x$ for the longest side, $4x$ for the middle-length side, and $3x$ for the shortest side. Find all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of complex numbers with $a^{k}+b^{k} \\neq 0$, $a+\\frac{10b}{a^{k}+b^{k}}=5$, and $b+\\frac{10a}{a^{k}+b^{k}}=4$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the scaling factor $x$ for the triangle with altitudes 12, 15, and 20. The sides are proportional to $5x$, $4x$, and $3x$ (since altitudes are inversely proportional to sides). Using the area formula for a right triangle (as $3x$, $4x$, $5x$ form a right triangle), the area is $6x^2$. Equating this to the area via altitude $12$ (for side $5x$): $\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cdot 5x \\\\cdot 12 = 30x$. Solving $6x^2 = 30x$ gives $x = 5$. Thus, $k = x - 3 = 2$.\\n\\nNext, solve the system with $k = 2$:\\n$$\\na + \\\\frac{10b}{a^2 + b^2} = 5, \\\\quad b + \\\\frac{10a}{a^2 + b^2} = 4.\\n$$\\nLet $S = a^2 + b^2$ and $t = \\\\frac{10}{S}$. Rewriting gives linear equations in $a$ and $b$, leading to a quartic equation in $t$. Solving yields $t = 2, \\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\frac{4 \\\\pm 3i}{5}$. Substituting back gives four ordered pairs $(a, b)$: $(1, 2)$, $(4, 2)$, $\\\\left(\\\\frac{5}{2}, 2 - \\\\frac{3i}{2}\\\\right)$, and $\\\\left(\\\\frac{5}{2}, 2 + \\\\frac{3i}{2}\\\\right)$. All satisfy $a^2 + b^2 \\\\neq 0$ and the original equations.\",\n    \"answer\": \"[(1, 2), (4, 2), (5/2, 2 - 3i/2), (5/2, 2 + 3i/2)]\"\n}",
