  "math_problem": "Let $S$ be the set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2012\\}$. A perfectutation is a bijective function $h$ from $S$ to itself such that there exists an $a \\in S$ such that $h(a) \\neq a$, and that for any pair of integers $a \\in S$ and $b \\in S$ such that $h(a) \\neq a, h(b) \\neq b$, there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $h^{k}(a)=b$. Let $n$ be the number of ordered pairs of perfectutations $(f, g)$ such that $f(g(i))=g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in S$, but $f \\neq g$. Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by 2011. Instead of determining the remainder when the number of ordered pairs of distinct commuting perfectutations is divided by the prime, simply find $m = p - 2010$, where $p$ is that prime. Find the largest positive integer $n$ for which there exist $n$ finite sets $X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots, X_{n}$ with the property that for every $m \\leq a<b<c \\leq n$, the equation $\\left|X_{a} \\cup X_{b} \\cup X_{c}\\right|=\\lceil\\sqrt{a b c}\\rceil$ holds.",
