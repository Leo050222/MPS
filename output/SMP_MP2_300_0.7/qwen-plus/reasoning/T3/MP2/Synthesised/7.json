Instead of counting the total number of triangle-free graphs with exactly 23 edges on the given labeled vertices, simply find $m = N_{\\Delta=5} - 37798$, where $N_{\\Delta=5}$ is the number of such graphs where the maximum degree is exactly 5. Suppose $f(x)$ is a rational function such that $3f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + \\frac{2f(x)}{x} = x^{2}$ for $x \\neq 0$. Find $f(-m)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding $ f(-m) $ where $ m = N_{\\\\Delta=5} - 37798 $. First, we determine $ N_{\\\\Delta=5} $, the number of triangle-free graphs on 10 labeled vertices with exactly 23 edges and maximum degree exactly 5.\\n\\nBy Turán's theorem, the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on 10 vertices is 25, achieved by the complete bipartite graph $ K_{5,5} $. To get 23 edges, we remove 2 edges from $ K_{5,5} $. The number of distinct $ K_{5,5} $ graphs is $ \\\\binom{10}{5}/2 = 126 $. Each $ K_{5,5} $ has 25 edges, so the number of ways to remove 2 edges is $ \\\\binom{25}{2} = 300 $. Thus, the total number of such graphs is $ 126 \\\\times 300 = 37800 $.\\n\\nSince removing 2 edges from $ K_{5,5} $ affects at most 4 vertices (reducing their degrees), the remaining 6 vertices still have degree 5, ensuring the maximum degree is exactly 5. Therefore, $ N_{\\\\Delta=5} = 37800 $, so $ m = 37800 - 37798 = 2 $.\\n\\nNext, solve the functional equation $ 3f\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{2f(x)}{x} = x^2 $. Substituting $ x \\\\to \\\\frac{1}{x} $ gives a second equation. Solving the system yields $ f(x) = \\\\frac{3}{5x^2} - \\\\frac{2x^3}{5} $. Evaluating at $ x = -m = -2 $:\\n$$\\nf(-2) = \\\\frac{3}{5(-2)^2} - \\\\frac{2(-2)^3}{5} = \\\\frac{3}{20} + \\\\frac{16}{5} = \\\\frac{3}{20} + \\\\frac{64}{20} = \\\\frac{67}{20}.\\n$$\",\n    \"answer\": \"67/20\"\n}",
