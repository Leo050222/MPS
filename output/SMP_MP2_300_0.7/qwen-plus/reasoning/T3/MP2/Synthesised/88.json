  "math_problem": "In the game of Galactic Dominion, players compete to amass cards, each of which is worth a certain number of points. Say you are playing a version of this game with only two kinds of cards, planet cards and hegemon cards. Each planet card is worth 2010 points, and each hegemon card is worth four points per planet card held. You start with no planet cards and no hegemon cards, and, on each turn, starting at turn one, you take either a planet card or a hegemon card, whichever is worth more points given the hand you currently hold. Define a sequence \\(\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}\\) for all positive integers \\(n\\) by setting \\(a_{n}\\) to be 0 if on turn \\(n\\) you take a planet card and 1 if you take a hegemon card. What is the smallest value of \\(N\\) such that the sequence \\(a_{N}, a_{N+1}, \\ldots\\) is necessarily periodic (meaning that there is a positive integer \\(k\\) such that \\(a_{n+k}=a_{n}\\) for all \\(n \\geq N\\)) ? Instead of determining the minimal index from which the tail of the sequence is periodic, simply find \\(k = a_{502} + 9\\), where \\(a_{502}\\) is the term of the sequence at position 502 derived from the game's decision rules. Two positive rational numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), when written in lowest terms, have the property that the sum of their numerators is \\(k\\) and the sum of their denominators is 10. What is the largest possible value of \\(x+y\\)?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the game mechanics of Galactic Dominion. Each turn, a player chooses between a planet card (worth 2010 points) or a hegemon card (worth 4 times the number of planet cards currently held). The decision is based on which option yields more points at that moment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine $ a_{502} $\\n\\nLet’s simulate the sequence $ \\\\{a_n\\\\} $, where:\\n- $ a_n = 0 $ if a **planet** card is taken on turn $ n $\\n- $ a_n = 1 $ if a **hegemon** card is taken on turn $ n $\\n\\nAt any turn $ n $, the value of a planet card is always 2010, and the value of a hegemon card is $ 4p $, where $ p $ is the number of planet cards already held before this turn.\\n\\nWe compare:\\n- Planet: 2010\\n- Hegemon: $ 4p $\\n\\nSo, as long as $ 4p < 2010 $, the player takes a planet card. This inequality holds when:\\n$$\\np < \\\\frac{2010}{4} = 502.5\\n$$\\nThus, for all $ p \\\\leq 502 $, the player takes a planet card.\\n\\nNow, consider turn $ n = 502 $:\\n- Before taking the card, the player has $ p = 501 $ planet cards (since they took one per turn up to turn 501)\\n- So, $ 4 \\\\times 501 = 2004 < 2010 $ → take a **planet** card\\n\\nTherefore, $ a_{502} = 0 $\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Compute $ k = a_{502} + 9 $\\n\\n$$\\nk = 0 + 9 = 9\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Maximize $ x + y $ Given Constraints\\n\\nWe are told:\\n- $ x $ and $ y $ are positive rational numbers in lowest terms\\n- Sum of numerators = $ k = 9 $\\n- Sum of denominators = 10\\n\\nLet:\\n- $ x = \\\\frac{a}{b} $, $ y = \\\\frac{c}{d} $\\n- With $ a + c = 9 $, $ b + d = 10 $\\n- And $ \\\\gcd(a,b) = \\\\gcd(c,d) = 1 $\\n\\nOur goal is to **maximize** $ x + y = \\\\frac{a}{b} + \\\\frac{c}{d} $\\n\\n#### Strategy:\\nTo maximize the sum, we want to make one fraction as large as possible while keeping the other valid under the constraints.\\n\\nTry $ a = 8, c = 1 $, $ b = 1, d = 9 $:\\n- $ x = \\\\frac{8}{1} = 8 $, $ y = \\\\frac{1}{9} $\\n- Both in lowest terms\\n- Numerators sum to 9, denominators sum to 10\\n- Sum: $ 8 + \\\\frac{1}{9} = \\\\frac{73}{9} $\\n\\nCheck other combinations (e.g., $ a = 7, c = 2 $, etc.), but none yield a larger sum than $ \\\\frac{73}{9} $\\n\\nHence, the **maximum** value of $ x + y $ is $ \\\\frac{73}{9} $\",\n    \"answer\": \"73/9\"\n}",
