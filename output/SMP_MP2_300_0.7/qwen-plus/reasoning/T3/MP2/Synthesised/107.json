Suppose $x^{3}-a x^{2}+b x-48$ is a polynomial with three positive roots $p, q$, and $r$ such that $p<q<r$. What is the minimum possible value of $k / p+2 / q+3 / r$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the Diophantine equation $m^5 - n^5 = 16mn$ for integer pairs $(m, n)$ with opposite signs. Assume $m = -a$ (negative) and $n$ positive, leading to $a^5 + n^5 = 16an$. Testing small integers, $(a, n) = (2, 2)$ satisfies the equation, giving $m = -2$, $n = 2$. Thus, $k = n - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nNext, consider the polynomial $x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48$ with positive roots $p < q < r$ where $pqr = 48$. Minimize $\\\\frac{k}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r} = \\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$ using Lagrange multipliers. The constraint $pqr = 48$ leads to ratios $q = 2p$, $r = 3p$. Solving $p \\\\cdot 2p \\\\cdot 3p = 48$ gives $p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$. Substituting these values yields $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{3}{2}$, which is the minimum value.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3/2\"\n}",
