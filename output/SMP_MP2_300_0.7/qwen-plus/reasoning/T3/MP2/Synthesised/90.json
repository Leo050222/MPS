  "math_problem": "For a real number $r$, the quadratics $x^{2}+(r-1)x+6$ and $x^{2}+(2r+1)x+22$ have a common real root. The sum of the possible values of $r$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100a+b$. Instead of computing the numerical value obtained by multiplying the numerator by 100 and adding the denominator of the reduced fractional representation of the sum of the possible parameter values, simply find $m = b - 4$, where $b$ is that denominator. Find the largest integer $n$ such that $3^{512}-m$ is divisible by $2^{n}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the condition that the two quadratics \\n$$\\nx^2 + (r - 1)x + 6 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad x^2 + (2r + 1)x + 22\\n$$\\nhave a common real root. Let this common root be $\\\\alpha$. Then both equations must be satisfied:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\alpha^2 + (r - 1)\\\\alpha + 6 = 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{(1)}\\n$$\\n$$\\n\\\\alpha^2 + (2r + 1)\\\\alpha + 22 = 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{(2)}\\n$$\\n\\nSubtracting equation (1) from (2), we eliminate $\\\\alpha^2$:\\n\\n$$\\n[(2r + 1) - (r - 1)]\\\\alpha + (22 - 6) = 0 \\\\Rightarrow (r + 2)\\\\alpha + 16 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nSolving for $\\\\alpha$, we get:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\alpha = -\\\\frac{16}{r + 2}, \\\\quad \\\\text{provided } r \\\\neq -2\\n$$\\n\\nNow substitute $\\\\alpha = -\\\\frac{16}{r + 2}$ into equation (1):\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left(-\\\\frac{16}{r + 2}\\\\right)^2 + (r - 1)\\\\left(-\\\\frac{16}{r + 2}\\\\right) + 6 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nMultiply through by $(r + 2)^2$ to eliminate denominators:\\n\\n$$\\n256 - 16(r - 1)(r + 2) + 6(r + 2)^2 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nExpanding and simplifying:\\n\\n$$\\n256 - 16(r^2 + r - 2) + 6(r^2 + 4r + 4) = 0\\n$$\\n$$\\n256 - 16r^2 - 16r + 32 + 6r^2 + 24r + 24 = 0\\n$$\\n$$\\n-10r^2 + 8r + 312 = 0 \\\\Rightarrow 5r^2 - 4r - 156 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nThis is a quadratic in $r$. The sum of its roots is given by $-b/a = \\\\frac{4}{5}$. Thus, the sum of possible values of $r$ is $\\\\frac{4}{5}$, so $a = 4$, $b = 5$.\\n\\nNext, the problem asks us to compute $m = b - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1$.\\n\\nWe are now tasked with finding the largest integer $n$ such that $3^{512} - m = 3^{512} - 1$ is divisible by $2^n$. This is equivalent to computing the 2-adic valuation $v_2(3^{512} - 1)$.\\n\\nUsing the identity:\\n$$\\n3^{512} - 1 = (3 - 1)(3 + 1)(3^2 + 1)(3^4 + 1)\\\\cdots(3^{256} + 1)\\n$$\\n\\nEach factor contributes to the power of 2 as follows:\\n- $3 - 1 = 2 \\\\Rightarrow v_2 = 1$\\n- $3 + 1 = 4 \\\\Rightarrow v_2 = 2$\\n- For $k \\\\geq 1$, $3^{2^k} + 1 \\\\equiv 2 \\\\mod 4 \\\\Rightarrow v_2 = 1$\\n\\nThere are 8 such terms where $k \\\\geq 1$, so total valuation is:\\n$$\\nv_2(3^{512} - 1) = 1 + 2 + 8 \\\\cdot 1 = 11\\n$$\\n\\nThus, the largest integer $n$ such that $2^n$ divides $3^{512} - 1$ is $11$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
