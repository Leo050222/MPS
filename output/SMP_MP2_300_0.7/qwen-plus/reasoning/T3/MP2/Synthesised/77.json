  "math_problem": "Marcus and four of his relatives are at a party. Each pair of the five people are either friends or enemies. For any two enemies, there is no person that they are both friends with. In how many ways is this possible? Instead of determining the total number of valid friendship and enmity assignments among the five people, simply find $q = s - 1$, where $s$ is the number of such assignments in which no two people are friends. How many lattice points are enclosed by the triangle with vertices $(q,99),(5,100)$, and $(2003,500)$? Don't count boundary points.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine q = s - 1 where s is the number of valid assignments with no two friends. The only such assignment is all enemies. For any two enemies (all pairs), there are no common friends (since no one is friends), so this assignment is valid. Thus, s = 1, so q = 0.\\n\\nNext, find interior lattice points of the triangle with vertices (0,99), (5,100), (2003,500). Using the shoelace formula, the area A = 1. Boundary points B: edge (0,99)-(5,100) has gcd(5,1)+1=2 points; edge (5,100)-(2003,500) has gcd(1998,400)+1=3 points; edge (2003,500)-(0,99) has gcd(2003,401)+1=2 points. Total boundary points B = 2+3+2-3 = 4. By Pick's Theorem, interior points I = A - B/2 + 1 = 1 - 4/2 + 1 = 0.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
