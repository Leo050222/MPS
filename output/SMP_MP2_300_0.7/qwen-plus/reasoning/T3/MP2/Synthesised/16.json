  "math_problem": "Alice draws three cards from a standard 52-card deck with replacement. Ace through 10 are worth 1 to 10 points respectively, and the face cards King, Queen, and Jack are each worth 10 points. The probability that the sum of the point values of the cards drawn is a multiple of 10 can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing a hundred times the numerator plus the denominator of the fraction representing the probability in lowest terms, simply find $k = d + 0$, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that probability fraction. Suppose $P(x)$ is a polynomial such that $P(1)=1$ and $$\\frac{P(2 x)}{P(x+1)}=8-\\frac{56}{x+7}$$ for all real $x$ for which both sides are defined. Find $P(-k)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the probability that the sum of three cards drawn with replacement is a multiple of 10. Each card's point value: 1-9 have 4 cards each (probability 1/13), 10 has 16 cards (probability 4/13). Using generating functions and roots of unity, the probability is calculated as (1/10)[1 + 9*(3/13)^3] = 244/2197. Since gcd(244, 2197)=1, d=1, so k = d + 0 = 1.\\n\\nNext, solve for polynomial P(x) with P(1)=1 and P(2x)/P(x+1) = 8x/(x+7). Assume P(x) is cubic. By analyzing roots and coefficients, P(x) = (1/21)x(x+2)(x+6). Verify P(1)=1 and the functional equation. Compute P(-1) = (1/21)(-1)(1)(5) = -5/21.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-5/21\"\n}",
