  "math_problem": "There are $N$ lockers, labeled from 1 to $N$, placed in clockwise order around a circular hallway. Initially, all lockers are open. Ansoon starts at the first locker and always moves clockwise. When she is at locker $n$ and there are more than $n$ open lockers, she keeps locker $n$ open and closes the next $n$ open lockers, then repeats the process with the next open locker. If she is at locker $n$ and there are at most $n$ lockers still open, she keeps locker $n$ open and closes all other lockers. She continues this process until only one locker is left open. What is the smallest integer $N>2021$ such that the last open locker is locker 1? Instead of determining the smallest integer greater than a fixed threshold such that the locker elimination process results in the starting locker being the last open, simply find $l = $ last $+ 0$, where last is the label of the last open locker derived from the analysis of the process in that scenario. For an even integer positive integer $n$ Kevin has a tape of length $4 n$ with marks at $-2 n,-2 n+1, \\ldots, 2 n-1,2 n$. He then randomly picks $n$ points in the set $-n,-n+1,-n+2, \\ldots, n-1, n$, and places a stone on each of these points. We call a stone 'stuck' if it is on $2 n$ or $-2 n$, or either all the points to the right, or all the points to the left, all contain stones. Then, every minute, Kevin shifts the unstuck stones in the following manner: He picks an unstuck stone uniformly at random and then flips a fair coin. If the coin came up heads, he then moves that stone and every stone in the largest contiguous set containing that stone one point to the left. If the coin came up tails, he moves every stone in that set one point right instead. He repeats until all the stones are stuck. Let $p_{k}$ be the probability that at the end of the process there are exactly $k$ stones in the right half. Evaluate $$\\frac{\\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k}{\\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} p_k}$$ in terms of $n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main components, but the key is to determine the value of $ l $ and then evaluate the given fraction involving probabilities $ p_k $.\\n\\nFirst, the locker problem states that we need to find $ l = \\\\text{last} + 0 $, where $ \\\\text{last} $ is the label of the last open locker. The problem specifies that we are considering the scenario where the last open locker is locker 1 (as we would for $ N > 2021 $), so $ \\\\text{last} = 1 $. Thus, $ l = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, for the stone process, Kevin places $ n $ stones on a tape from $ -2n $ to $ 2n $, with initial positions in $ \\\\{-n, -n+1, \\\\ldots, n\\\\} $. A stone is stuck if it's at the ends ($ \\\\pm 2n $) or if all points to one side are occupied. The process continues until all stones are stuck, and $ p_k $ is the probability of exactly $ k $ stones in the right half (positions $ > 0 $).\\n\\nThe fraction to evaluate is:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k}{\\\\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} p_k}\\n$$\\nwith $ l = 1 $. For even $ n $, the sum runs from $ k = 1 $ to $ k = n-1 $.\\n\\nBy symmetry of the initial setup and the process (left-right symmetry), $ p_k = p_{n-k} $. For $ n = 2 $ (smallest even $ n $), the sum has only one term ($ k = 1 $), so the numerator and denominator both equal $ p_1 $, giving a ratio of 1. This pattern holds for larger even $ n $ due to the alternating signs and symmetry, where the numerator simplifies to the denominator. Thus, the fraction is always 1 for any even $ n $.\", \"answer\": \"1\"}",
