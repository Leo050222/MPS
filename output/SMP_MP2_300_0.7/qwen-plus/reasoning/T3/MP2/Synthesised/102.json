  "math_problem": "Simplify: $2 \\sqrt{1.5+\\sqrt{2}}-(1.5+\\sqrt{2})$. Instead of determining the simplified value of the given algebraic expression, simply find $k = \\sqrt{4} - 1$, where $\\sqrt{4}$ is the rational component in the denested form of the nested square root derived from the structural analysis of the expression. Find a nonzero monic polynomial $P(x)$ with integer coefficients and minimal degree such that $P(k-\\sqrt[3]{2}+\\sqrt[3]{4})=0$. (A polynomial is called monic if its leading coefficient is 1.)",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute $ k = \\\\sqrt{4} - 1 $. Since $ \\\\sqrt{4} = 2 $, we have $ k = 2 - 1 = 1 $. Next, define $ \\\\beta = k - \\\\sqrt[3]{2} + \\\\sqrt[3]{4} = 1 - \\\\alpha + \\\\alpha^2 $ where $ \\\\alpha = \\\\sqrt[3]{2} $ (so $ \\\\alpha^3 = 2 $). To find the minimal monic polynomial with integer coefficients for $ \\\\beta $, express $ \\\\beta $ in terms of $ \\\\alpha $ and eliminate $ \\\\alpha $. Starting with $ \\\\beta = \\\\alpha^2 - \\\\alpha + 1 $, rearrange to $ \\\\alpha^2 = \\\\beta + \\\\alpha - 1 $. Multiply by $ \\\\alpha $: $ \\\\alpha^3 = \\\\beta\\\\alpha + \\\\alpha^2 - \\\\alpha $. Substitute $ \\\\alpha^3 = 2 $ and $ \\\\alpha^2 = \\\\beta + \\\\alpha - 1 $: $ 2 = \\\\beta\\\\alpha + (\\\\beta + \\\\alpha - 1) - \\\\alpha $, simplifying to $ \\\\beta\\\\alpha = 3 - \\\\beta $, so $ \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{3 - \\\\beta}{\\\\beta} $. Substitute into $ \\\\alpha^3 = 2 $: $ \\\\left( \\\\frac{3 - \\\\beta}{\\\\beta} \\\\right)^3 = 2 $. Expanding gives $ (3 - \\\\beta)^3 = 2\\\\beta^3 $, leading to $ 27 - 27\\\\beta + 9\\\\beta^2 - \\\\beta^3 = 2\\\\beta^3 $. Rearranging terms yields $ 3\\\\beta^3 - 9\\\\beta^2 + 27\\\\beta - 27 = 0 $, and dividing by 3 gives the monic polynomial $ \\\\beta^3 - 3\\\\beta^2 + 9\\\\beta - 9 = 0 $. This polynomial is irreducible over $ \\\\mathbb{Q} $ (no rational roots via Rational Root Theorem and degree 3), so it is minimal.\",\n    \"answer\": \"x^3 - 3x^2 + 9x - 9\"\n}",
