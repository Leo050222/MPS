  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be square with 4 digits, such that all its digits are less than 6. If we add 1 to each digit the resulting number is another square. Find $n$ Instead of identifying the 4-digit perfect square satisfying the digit increment condition, simply find $m = a - 42$, where $a$ is the integer whose square is that number. P is a polynomial. When P is divided by $x-1$, the remainder is -4 . When P is divided by $x-2$, the remainder is -1 . When $P$ is divided by $x-3$, the remainder is 4 . Determine the remainder when $P$ is divided by $x^{m}-6 x^{2}+11 x-6$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find the 4-digit square $ n = a^2 $ where all digits are less than 6. Adding 1 to each digit gives another square $ b^2 $, so $ b^2 - a^2 = 1111 $. Factoring $ (b-a)(b+a) = 1111 $, the valid factor pair is $ (11, 101) $, yielding $ a = 45 $ and $ b = 56 $. Thus, $ m = a - 42 = 3 $. Next, the divisor polynomial $ x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 $ factors as $ (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) $. The remainder $ R(x) $ when $ P $ is divided by this cubic must satisfy $ R(1) = -4 $, $ R(2) = -1 $, $ R(3) = 4 $. Solving the system for $ R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $ gives $ R(x) = x^2 - 5 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"x^2 - 5\"\n}",
