  "math_problem": "Let $x, y, z$ be real numbers satisfying $$\\frac{1}{x}+y+z=x+\\frac{1}{y}+z=x+y+\\frac{1}{z}=3$$ The sum of all possible values of $x+y+z$ can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing the sum of all possible totals and the associated $100m + n$, simply find $k = z - 2$, where $z$ is the common value taken by the two equal variables in the solution where exactly two of the variables are equal. Regular polygons $I C A O, V E N T I$, and $A L B E D O$ lie on a plane. Given that $I N= k$, compute the number of possible values of $O N$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve for the case where exactly two variables are equal in the system $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 3$. Assume $x = y \\\\neq z$. Substituting into the equations gives $\\\\frac{1}{x} + x + z = 3$ and $2x + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 3$. Solving leads to a cubic equation $2x^3 - 9x^2 + 10x - 3 = 0$, with roots $x = 1$, $x = \\\\frac{1}{2}$, and $x = 3$. The roots $x = 1$ and $x = \\\\frac{1}{2}$ result in all variables equal, so the only valid solution with exactly two equal variables is $x = y = 3$, $z = -\\\\frac{1}{3}$. The common value of the two equal variables is $3$, so $k = z - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1$.\\n\\nNext, consider the regular polygons: ICAO (square, 4-gon), VENTI (pentagon, 5-gon), and ALBEDO (hexagon, 6-gon). The shared vertices are $I$ (square and pentagon), $A$ (square and hexagon), $E$ (pentagon and hexagon), and $O$ (square and hexagon). Given $IN = k = 1$, where $N$ is a vertex of the pentagon and $O$ is a vertex of the square and hexagon, the number of possible values of $ON$ depends on the geometric constraints.\\n\\nThe square and hexagon share vertices $A$ and $O$, while the pentagon shares $I$ with the square and $E$ with the hexagon. The distance $IN = 1$ fixes the pentagon's scale relative to $I$. The square and hexagon's relative orientation allows two distinct configurations (mirror images) due to the angle constraints at shared vertices, leading to two distinct distances for $ON$. Thus, the number of possible values of $ON$ is $2$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2\"\n}",
