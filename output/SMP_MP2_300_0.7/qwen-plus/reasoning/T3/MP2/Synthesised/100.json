  "math_problem": "For each positive integer $n$, there is a circle around the origin with radius $n$. Rainbow Dash starts off somewhere on the plane, but not on a circle. She takes off in some direction in a straight path. She moves $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}$ units before crossing a circle, then $\\sqrt{5}$ units, then $\\frac{3 \\sqrt{5}}{5}$ units. What distance will she travel before she crosses another circle? Instead of determining the distance before crossing another circle, simply find $k = d - 6$, where $d$ is the distance to the next circle crossing derived from the geometric analysis of the straight-line trajectory relative to the concentric circles. A restricted path of length $n$ is a path of length $n$ such that for all $i$ between 1 and $n-2$ inclusive, if the $i$th step is upward, the $i+1$st step must be rightward. Find the number of restricted paths that start at $(k,k)$ and end at $(7,3)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main parts: determining $ k = d - 6 $ where $ d $ is the distance to the next circle crossing, and counting restricted paths from $ (k, k) $ to $ (7, 3) $.\\n\\n### **Part 1: Finding $ k $**\\nRainbow Dash crosses concentric circles with radii $ n $, starting from a point not on any circle. The distances between crossings are given as $ \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}}{5} $, $ \\\\sqrt{5} $, and $ \\\\frac{3\\\\sqrt{5}}{5} $. Using geometric analysis:\\n\\n- Let $ r $ be the radius of the first circle crossed. The perpendicular distance from the origin to the path is $ h $.\\n- The cumulative distances to the first three crossings are:\\n  - $ t_1 = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}}{5} $\\n  - $ t_2 = \\\\frac{6\\\\sqrt{5}}{5} $\\n  - $ t_3 = \\\\frac{9\\\\sqrt{5}}{5} $\\n- These satisfy:\\n  $$\\n  t_1^2 + h^2 = r^2, \\\\quad t_2^2 + h^2 = (r+1)^2, \\\\quad t_3^2 + h^2 = (r+2)^2\\n  $$\\n- Subtracting equations gives:\\n  $$\\n  t_2^2 - t_1^2 = 2r + 1 \\\\implies 7 = 2r + 1 \\\\implies r = 3\\n  $$\\n  $$\\n  t_3^2 - t_2^2 = 2r + 3 \\\\implies 9 = 9 \\\\quad \\\\text{(valid)}\\n  $$\\n- For the fourth crossing at radius $ r+3 = 6 $:\\n  $$\\n  t_4^2 = 6^2 - h^2 = 36 - \\\\frac{44}{5} = \\\\frac{136}{5} \\\\implies t_4 = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{136}{5}}\\n  $$\\n- The distance to the next crossing is:\\n  $$\\n  d = t_4 - t_3 = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{136}{5}} - \\\\frac{9}{\\\\sqrt{5}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{136} - 9}{\\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\approx 1.19\\n  $$\\n- Thus, $ k = d - 6 \\\\approx -4.81 $. Since $ k $ must be an integer for the path problem (coordinates must be integers), we round to $ k = -5 $.\\n\\n### **Part 2: Counting Restricted Paths**\\nA restricted path of length $ n $ has the condition: for all $ i \\\\in [1, n-2] $, if the $ i $-th step is upward (U), the $ (i+1) $-st step must be rightward (R). We count paths from $ (-5, -5) $ to $ (7, 3) $:\\n\\n- Right steps: $ 7 - (-5) = 12 $\\n- Up steps: $ 3 - (-5) = 8 $\\n- Total steps: $ n = 20 $\\n\\nThe restriction implies no \\\"UU\\\" in the first 19 steps (positions 1–19). Valid paths are:\\n- **Case 1**: 19th step is R, 20th is U (7 U's in first 19 steps):\\n  $$\\n  \\\\binom{19 - 7 + 1}{7} = \\\\binom{13}{7} = 1716\\n  $$\\n- **Case 2**: 19th and 20th steps are U (6 U's in first 18 steps, ending with R):\\n  $$\\n  \\\\binom{18 - 6 + 1}{6} = \\\\binom{13}{6} = 1716 \\\\quad \\\\text{(but adjusted to first 18 steps)} \\\\implies \\\\binom{12}{6} = 924\\n  $$\\n- Total paths: $ 1716 + 924 = 2640 $.\", \"answer\": \"2640\"}",
