Let $x, y, n$ be positive integers with $n > k$. How many ordered triples $(x, y, n)$ of solutions are there to the equation $x^{n}-y^{n}=2^{100}$ ?",

Both factors must be powers of 2 with $ x - y = 2^a $, $ x + y = 2^b $, $ a + b = 100 $, $ a < b $, and $ a \\\\geq 1 $ (to ensure integer $ x, y $).\\n     - Valid $ a $ values: $ 1 \\\\leq a \\\\leq 49 $ (since $ b = 100 - a > a \\\\Rightarrow a < 50 $), giving **49 solutions**.\\n   - For $ n \\\\geq 3 $: By Mihăilescu's theorem and factorization analysis, no solutions exist because the required conditions for powers of 2 cannot be satisfied (e.g., sums of terms would not be powers of 2, or parity issues arise).\\n\\nThus, only $ n = 2 $ yields valid solutions, totaling **49 ordered triples**.\",\n    \"answer\": \"49\"\n}",
