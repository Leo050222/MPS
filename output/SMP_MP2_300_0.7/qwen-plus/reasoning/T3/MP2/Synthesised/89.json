  "math_problem": "There are 8 lily pads in a pond numbered $1,2, \\ldots, 8$. A frog starts on lily pad 1. During the $i$-th second, the frog jumps from lily pad $i$ to $i+1$, falling into the water with probability $\\frac{1}{i+1}$. The probability that the frog lands safely on lily pad 8 without having fallen into the water at any point can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Find $100 m+n$. Instead of determining the numerical value derived from the reduced fractional representation of the survival probability, simply find $k = P + \\frac{16023}{8}$, where $P$ is the probability that the frog lands safely on lily pad 8 without having fallen into the water at any point derived from the sequential jump success probabilities suggested by the jumping mechanism. Find the value of $$ \\binom{k}{1}+\\binom{k}{4}+\\binom{k}{7}+\\cdots+\\binom{k}{2002} $$.",
