  "math_problem": "How many ways, without taking order into consideration, can 2002 be expressed as the sum of 3 positive integers (for instance, $1000+1000+2$ and $1000+2+1000$ are considered to be the same way)? Instead of determining the total number of unordered triples of positive integers that sum to the given total, simply find $l$, the terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends. Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer with exactly $(l + 2012)$ positive factors. What is the sum of the (not necessarily distinct) prime factors of $n$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing how many **unordered** triples of positive integers sum to 2002. This is equivalent to finding all combinations $ (a, b, c) $ such that:\\n\\n$$\\na + b + c = 2002 \\\\quad \\\\text{with} \\\\quad a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c\\n$$\\n\\nThis leads to a case analysis based on the value of the middle term $ b $. The key insight is that for each valid $ b $, there are certain constraints on $ a $ and $ c $, which can be translated into arithmetic sequences.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine the Range of $ b $\\n\\nWe consider two cases:\\n\\n- **Case 1:** $ b \\\\leq \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2002}{3} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 667 $\\n- **Case 2:** $ b \\\\geq 668 $ and $ b \\\\leq \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2001}{2} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 1000 $\\n\\nThe number of values in Case 1 is $ 667 $, while in Case 2 it's $ 1000 - 668 + 1 = 333 $. Since $ 333 < 667 $, **Case 2 is the shorter sequence**.\\n\\nThe terminal term (i.e., the last value) of this shorter sequence is $ \\\\boxed{1000} $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nl = 1000\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Compute $ l + 2012 $\\n\\n$$\\nl + 2012 = 1000 + 2012 = 3012\\n$$\\n\\nWe now seek the smallest positive integer $ n $ with exactly **3012 positive divisors**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Factorization of 3012\\n\\n$$\\n3012 = 2^2 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 251\\n$$\\n\\nTo minimize $ n $, we want to assign the largest exponents to the smallest primes. The number of divisors of $ n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\\\cdots p_k^{e_k} $ is:\\n\\n$$\\n(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)\\\\cdots(e_k + 1)\\n$$\\n\\nSo we need to find the factorization of 3012 into integers greater than 1, sorted in decreasing order, and then subtract 1 from each to get the exponents.\\n\\nThe optimal factorization (to minimize $ n $) is:\\n\\n$$\\n3012 = 251 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 2\\n$$\\n\\nWhich gives exponents:\\n\\n$$\\ne_1 = 250,\\\\quad e_2 = 2,\\\\quad e_3 = 1,\\\\quad e_4 = 1\\n$$\\n\\nAssigning these to the smallest primes:\\n\\n$$\\nn = 2^{250} \\\\cdot 3^2 \\\\cdot 5^1 \\\\cdot 7^1\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Sum of Prime Factors (with Multiplicity)\\n\\nNow compute the sum of all prime factors of $ n $, counting multiplicity:\\n\\n- $ 2 $ appears 250 times: $ 250 \\\\times 2 = 500 $\\n- $ 3 $ appears 2 times: $ 2 \\\\times 3 = 6 $\\n- $ 5 $ appears once: $ 5 $\\n- $ 7 $ appears once: $ 7 $\\n\\nTotal:\\n\\n$$\\n500 + 6 + 5 + 7 = \\\\boxed{518}\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"518\"}",
