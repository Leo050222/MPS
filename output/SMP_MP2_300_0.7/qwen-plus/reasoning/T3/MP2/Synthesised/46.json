  "math_problem": "Determine the number of integers $2 \\leq n \\leq 2016$ such that $n^{n}-1$ is divisible by $2,3,5,7$. Instead of determining the number of integers in the given range satisfying the specified modular congruence conditions, simply find $m = \\gcd(n,6) - 1$, where $\\gcd(n,6)$ is the greatest common divisor between such an integer $n$ and $6$, derived from the analysis that such $n$ must be coprime to the primes $2$ and $3$. Assume the quartic $x^{4}-a x^{3}+b x^{2}-a x+d=0$ has four real roots $m + \\frac{1}{2} \\leq x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4} \\leq 2$. Find the maximum possible value of $\\frac{\\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\\right)\\left(x_{1}+x_{3}\\right) x_{4}}{\\left(x_{4}+x_{2}\\right)\\left(x_{4}+x_{3}\\right) x_{1}}$ (over all valid choices of $\\left.a, b, d\\right)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding the maximum value of the expression $\\\\frac{(x_1 + x_2)(x_1 + x_3)x_4}{(x_4 + x_2)(x_4 + x_3)x_1}$ for a quartic polynomial $x^4 - ax^3 + bx^2 - ax + d = 0$ with four real roots in $[0.5, 2]$. First, from the problem statement, $m = \\\\gcd(n, 6) - 1$ where $n$ must be coprime to 2 and 3, so $\\\\gcd(n, 6) = 1$, giving $m = 0$. Thus, the roots lie in $[0.5, 2]$.\\n\\nThe quartic has coefficients such that the sum of roots equals the sum of products of roots three at a time (from Vieta's formulas: $S = P_3$). For roots $0.5, 1, 1, 2$, this condition holds: $S = 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.5$ and $P_3 = 0.5 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\cdot 1 + 0.5 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\cdot 2 + 0.5 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\cdot 2 + 1 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\cdot 2 = 4.5$.\\n\\nTo maximize the expression, assign $x_1 = 0.5$ (smallest root), $x_2 = 2$, $x_3 = 1$, $x_4 = 1$ (valid permutation of roots):\\n$$\\nE = \\\\frac{(0.5 + 2)(0.5 + 1) \\\\cdot 1}{(1 + 2)(1 + 1) \\\\cdot 0.5} = \\\\frac{2.5 \\\\cdot 1.5}{3 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 0.5} = \\\\frac{3.75}{3} = 1.25 = \\\\frac{5}{4}.\\n$$\\n\\nAnalysis shows this is the maximum, as other root assignments or polynomials yield lower values due to constraints from Vieta's formulas and the interval $[0.5, 2]$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5/4\"\n}",
