  "math_problem": "Find all positive integers $a,b$ for which $a^4+4b^4$ is a prime number. Instead of finding all positive integer pairs that make the given expression prime, simply find $m$, the prime number equal to that expression. Manya has a stack of $85=1+4+16+64$ blocks comprised of 4 layers (the $k$ th layer from the top has $4^{k-1}$ blocks). Each block rests on 4 smaller blocks, each with dimensions half those of the larger block. Laura removes blocks one at a time from this stack, removing only blocks that currently have no blocks on top of them. Find the number of ways Laura can remove precisely $m$ blocks from Manya's stack (the order in which they are removed matters).",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine the prime number $ m = a^4 + 4b^4 $ for positive integers $ a, b $. Using the **Sophie Germain identity**,\\n\\n$$\\na^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2)\\n$$\\n\\nFor this product to be prime, one of the factors must equal 1. Since both factors are positive integers and $ a, b \\\\geq 1 $, the only viable case is when:\\n\\n$$\\na^2 - 2ab + 2b^2 = 1 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad (a - b)^2 + b^2 = 1\\n$$\\n\\nThis equation holds only when $ a = b = 1 $, yielding:\\n\\n$$\\na^4 + 4b^4 = 1 + 4 = 5\\n$$\\n\\nThus, $ m = 5 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\nNext, we analyze the block removal process from Manya's stack. The stack has 4 layers with sizes:\\n- Layer 1: 1 block\\n- Layer 2: 4 blocks\\n- Layer 3: 16 blocks\\n- Layer 4: 64 blocks\\n\\nEach block rests on 4 smaller blocks below it, forming a rooted 4-ary tree where each node (block) has 4 children. Laura removes blocks in an order such that a block can only be removed if all blocks above it have been removed.\\n\\nWe are to count the number of ways to remove exactly $ m = 5 $ blocks, where the order matters.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of **linear extensions** of a rooted 4-ary tree of depth 4, restricted to removing exactly 5 nodes starting from the root.\\n\\nLet $ g(n) $ denote the number of ways to remove $ n $ blocks from such a tree. We compute $ g(5) $ using a recursive approach based on distributing the remaining $ n-1 $ removals among the 4 subtrees rooted at the children of the root.\\n\\nThe recurrence is:\\n\\n$$\\ng(n) = \\\\sum_{m_1 + \\\\cdots + m_4 = n-1} \\\\frac{(n-1)!}{m_1! \\\\cdots m_4!} \\\\cdot \\\\prod_{i=1}^4 g(m_i)\\n$$\\n\\nwith base cases:\\n- $ g(0) = 1 $\\n- $ g(1) = 1 $\\n\\nComputing step-by-step:\\n\\n- $ g(2) = 4 $\\n- $ g(3) = 28 $\\n- $ g(4) = 280 $\\n- $ g(5) = 3640 $\\n\\nHence, the number of valid sequences to remove exactly 5 blocks is **3640**.\", \"answer\": \"3640\"}",
