  "math_problem": "Determine the positive real value of $x$ for which $$\\sqrt{2+A C+2 C x}+\\sqrt{A C-2+2 A x}=\\sqrt{2(A+C) x+2 A C}$$. Instead of determining the positive real number that equates the sum of the two specified square roots to the third square root, simply find $k = b + 5$, where $b$ is the value assumed by the inner expression of the second square root when the equation holds. Solve the equation\n\\[ 3^x - k^y = z^2. \\]\nin positive integers.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the equation involving square roots. Squaring both sides and simplifying shows that the product of the inner expressions of the square roots must be zero. Since the first inner expression is always positive for positive x, the second inner expression must be zero. Thus, b = AC - 2 + 2Ax = 0, so k = b + 5 = 5. Next, solve 3^x - 5^y = z^2 in positive integers. Testing small values reveals that x=2, y=1, z=2 satisfies the equation (3^2 - 5^1 = 9 - 5 = 4 = 2^2). Further analysis using modular arithmetic and factorization confirms this is the only solution.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2,1,2\"\n}",
