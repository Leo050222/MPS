  "math_problem": "Given complex number $z$, define sequence $z_{0}, z_{1}, z_{2}, \\ldots$ as $z_{0}=z$ and $z_{n+1}=2 z_{n}^{2}+2 z_{n}$ for $n \\geq 0$. Given that $z_{10}=2017$, find the minimum possible value of $|z|$. Instead of determining the minimal modulus of the initial complex number that generates the given terminal sequence value, simply find $k = w_{10} + \\frac{1965}{2}$, where $w_{10}$ is the tenth term of the auxiliary sequence obtained by adding $\\frac{1}{2}$ to each term of the original sequence. Compute the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $n^{2}-k$ is a perfect square.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem defines a sequence $ z_n $ with $ z_{n+1} = 2z_n^2 + 2z_n $ and introduces an auxiliary sequence $ w_n = z_n + \\\\frac{1}{2} $. Substituting $ z_n = w_n - \\\\frac{1}{2} $ into the recurrence simplifies it to $ w_{n+1} = 2w_n^2 $, which has the closed-form solution $ w_n = 2^{2^n - 1} w_0^{2^n} $. Given $ z_{10} = 2017 $, we find $ w_{10} = z_{10} + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{4035}{2} $. Then $ k = w_{10} + \\\\frac{1965}{2} = \\\\frac{4035 + 1965}{2} = 3000 $.\\n\\nNext, we solve $ n^2 - k = m^2 $ for positive integers $ n $, which rearranges to $ (n - m)(n + m) = 3000 $. Factor pairs of 3000 with both factors even (to ensure $ n $ and $ m $ are integers) yield valid $ n $ values: 55, 65, 85, 131, 155, 253, 377, 751. Summing these gives 1872.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1872\"\n}",
