  "math_problem": "A tightrope walker stands in the center of a rope of length 32 meters. Every minute she walks forward one meter with probability $3 / 4$ and backward one meter with probability $1 / 4$. What is the probability that she reaches the end in front of her before the end behind her? Instead of computing the probability of reaching the forward end before the backward end in this biased random walk on a line, simply find $k = r + 2/3$, where $r$ is the ratio of the backward probability to the forward probability. Sam spends his days walking around the following $2 \\times 2$ grid of squares. Say that two squares are adjacent if they share a side. He starts at the square labeled $k$ and every second walks to an adjacent square. How many paths can Sam take so that the sum of the numbers on every square he visits in his path is equal to 20 (not counting the square he started on)?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve for k in the tightrope walker problem. The backward probability is 1/4 and forward is 3/4, so the ratio r = (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3. Then k = r + 2/3 = 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. \\n\\nNext, analyze Sam's grid problem. The 2x2 grid has squares labeled such that the starting square is k=1. Assuming standard row-major labeling (1, 2, 3, 4), the adjacency and labels are:\\n- Square 1 (start) adjacent to 2 and 3\\n- Square 2 adjacent to 1 and 4\\n- Square 3 adjacent to 1 and 4\\n- Square 4 adjacent to 2 and 3\\n\\nLabels: 1, 2, 3, 4. The sum of visited squares (excluding the start) must equal 20. Using dynamic programming with states for each square and sum, we define:\\n- a_s: paths ending at 1 with sum s\\n- b_s: paths ending at 2 with sum s\\n- c_s: paths ending at 3 with sum s\\n- d_s: paths ending at 4 with sum s\\n\\nRecurrence relations:\\na_s = b_{s-1} + c_{s-1}\\nb_s = a_{s-2} + d_{s-2}\\nc_s = a_{s-3} + d_{s-3}\\nd_s = b_{s-4} + c_{s-4}\\n\\nComputing up to s=20:\\n- Total paths for sum=20 is a_20 + b_20 + c_20 + d_20 = 74 + 42 + 43 + 31 = 190.\",\n    \"answer\": \"190\"\n}",
