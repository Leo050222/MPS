  "math_problem": "Let $f(x)=x^{2}-2$, and let $f^{n}$ denote the function $f$ applied $n$ times. Consider the sequence $(L_n)$ defined by $L_0 = 2$, $L_1 = 1$, and $L_{n+2} = L_{n+1} + L_n$ for $n \\geq 0$. Compute the remainder when $f^{24}(18)$ is divided by 89. Instead of determining the value modulo the given prime of the result of iterating the quadratic function the specified number of times starting from the given initial value, simply find $d = L_8 - 42$, where $L_8$ is the eighth term of the sequence $(L_n)$ defined in the problem. How many polynomials of degree exactly $d$ with real coefficients send the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ to a permutation of itself?",

For any permutation of $\\\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\\\}$, there is a unique interpolating polynomial of degree at most 5. This polynomial has degree exactly 5 if and only if it does not lie on a polynomial of degree $\\\\leq 4$.\\n\\nThe total number of permutations is $6! = 720$. The only permutations that correspond to polynomials of degree $\\\\leq 4$ are the two affine linear permutations: the identity permutation ($P(x) = x$) and the reverse permutation ($P(x) = 7 - x$). These are the only polynomials of degree $\\\\leq 1$ (hence $\\\\leq 4$) that bijectively map $\\\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\\\}$ to itself. Higher-degree polynomials cannot induce permutations due to constraints on finite differences and the requirement for distinct values within the set.\\n\\nThus, the number of polynomials of degree exactly 5 is $720 - 2 = 718$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"718\"\n}",
