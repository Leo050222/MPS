  "math_problem": "For a given positive integer $n$, we define $\\varphi(n)$ to be the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ which share no common prime factors with $n$. Find all positive integers $n$ for which $\\varphi(2019 n)=\\varphi\\left(n^{2}\\right)$. Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ for which $\\varphi(2019 n)=\\varphi(n^2)$, simply find $k=\\gcd(2019,n)-2018$, where $n$ is the positive integer solution that is a multiple of $2019$. The sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$ of real numbers satisfies the recurrence $a_{n+1}=\\frac{a_{n}^{2}-a_{n-1}+2 a_{n}}{a_{n-1}+k}$. Given that $a_{1}=k$ and $a_{9}=7$, find $a_{5}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, factorize 2019 = 3 × 673 (both primes). For n to be a multiple of 2019, write n = 2019m. The equation φ(2019n) = φ(n²) requires analyzing Euler's totient function. By expressing n in terms of prime factors and simplifying, we find that the only n multiple of 2019 satisfying the equation is n = 2019. Thus, gcd(2019, n) = 2019, so k = 2019 - 2018 = 1.\\n\\nNext, with k = 1, the recurrence becomes a_{n+1} = (a_n² + 2a_n - a_{n-1}) / (a_{n-1} + 1). Given a₁ = 1 and a₉ = 7, we derive a pattern for the sequence: for n ≥ 2, a_n = t^{n-1}/2^{n-2} - 1 where t = x + 1 (x = a₂). Using a₉ = 7, solve t^8 / 128 - 1 = 7 ⇒ t^8 = 1024 ⇒ t^4 = 32. Then a₅ = t^4 / 8 - 1 = 32 / 8 - 1 = 3.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
