  "math_problem": "Let $S(n)$ be the sum of the digits of the positive integer $n$. Find all $n$ such that $S(n)(S(n)-1)=n-1$. Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ satisfying the given condition, simply find $k = S(n) + 4$, where $n$ is the smallest such positive integer. Penta chooses $k$ of the vertices of a unit cube. What is the maximum possible volume of the figure whose vertices are the $k$ chosen points?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the equation:\\n\\n$$\\nS(n)(S(n) - 1) = n - 1\\n$$\\n\\nLet $ s = S(n) $, the sum of the digits of $ n $. Then the equation becomes:\\n\\n$$\\ns(s - 1) = n - 1 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad n = s^2 - s + 1\\n$$\\n\\nWe are to find the **smallest positive integer** $ n $ such that $ S(n) = s $, i.e., the digit sum of $ n = s^2 - s + 1 $ is exactly $ s $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Try small values of $ s $\\n\\n- $ s = 1 $:  \\n  $ n = 1^2 - 1 + 1 = 1 $, and $ S(1) = 1 $ → valid.\\n- $ s = 2 $:  \\n  $ n = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3 $, $ S(3) = 3 \\\\neq 2 $ → invalid.\\n- $ s = 3 $:  \\n  $ n = 9 - 3 + 1 = 7 $, $ S(7) = 7 \\\\neq 3 $ → invalid.\\n- $ s = 4 $:  \\n  $ n = 16 - 4 + 1 = 13 $, $ S(13) = 1 + 3 = 4 $ → valid.\\n\\nHowever, since $ n = 1 $ (for $ s = 1 $) is smaller than $ n = 13 $, it is the **smallest solution**.\\n\\nThus, the smallest $ n $ satisfying the condition is $ n = 1 $, and $ S(n) = 1 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Compute $ k = S(n) + 4 $\\n\\n$$\\nk = 1 + 4 = 5\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Determine the maximum volume of a figure formed by choosing 5 vertices from a unit cube\\n\\nA unit cube has 8 vertices. We are to choose **5** of them and compute the **maximum possible volume** of the convex polyhedron formed by those points.\\n\\nThe key insight is that the **maximum volume** for a convex polyhedron with 5 vertices in a unit cube is achieved when the selected vertices form a specific configuration:\\n\\n- Vertices: $ (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1) $\\n- These correspond to all cube vertices where at least two coordinates are 1, plus the origin.\\n\\nThis configuration forms a convex polyhedron whose volume can be computed as the region within the cube where the triangle inequalities hold:\\n\\n$$\\nx + y \\\\geq z,\\\\quad x + z \\\\geq y,\\\\quad y + z \\\\geq x\\n$$\\n\\nThis region excludes three disjoint tetrahedrons each of volume $ \\\\frac{1}{6} $, so the total excluded volume is $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $, leaving:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Volume} = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\n$$\\n\\nThis is the **maximum possible volume** for any set of 5 vertices in the unit cube.\", \"answer\": \"1/2\"}",
