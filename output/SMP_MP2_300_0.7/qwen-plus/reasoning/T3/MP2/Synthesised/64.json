  "math_problem": "Regular hexagon $P_{1} P_{2} P_{3} P_{4} P_{5} P_{6}$ has side length 2. For $1 \\leq i \\leq 6$, let $C_{i}$ be a unit circle centered at $P_{i}$ and $\\ell_{i}$ be one of the internal common tangents of $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+2}$, where $C_{7}=C_{1}$ and $C_{8}=C_{2}$. Assume that the lines $\\{\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}, \\ell_{5}, \\ell_{6}\\}$ bound a regular hexagon. The area of this hexagon can be expressed as $\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of determining the value 100 times the numerator plus the denominator for the area of the bounded regular hexagon when expressed as the square root of a reduced fraction, simply find $k$, the denominator of that reduced fraction. Find all square numbers $ S_1$ and $ S_2$ such that $ S_1 - S_2 = k + 1986$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves a regular hexagon with side length 2, where unit circles are centered at each vertex. Internal common tangents of circles two vertices apart form a smaller regular hexagon. The key steps are:\\n\\n1. **Distance between centers**: For vertices $P_i$ and $P_{i+2}$ in the original hexagon, the distance is $2\\\\sqrt{3}$ (since the central angle is $120^\\\\circ$).\\n2. **Internal common tangents**: For two unit circles separated by $2\\\\sqrt{3}$, the internal common tangents are lines equidistant from the origin due to symmetry. The distance from the origin to each tangent line (apothem of the bounded hexagon) is calculated as $\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}}$.\\n3. **Area of bounded hexagon**: Using the apothem $A = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}}$, the area of a regular hexagon is $\\\\frac{3\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. Relating $s$ to $A$ ($A = \\\\frac{s\\\\sqrt{3}}{2}$), the area simplifies to $\\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{3}}{3}$. This equals $\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{16}{3}}$, so $a = 16$, $b = 3$ (reduced fraction).\\n4. **Denominator $k$**: The denominator $b = 3$, so $k = 3$.\\n\\nThe problem specifies to find $k$, the denominator of the reduced fraction inside the square root for the area. Thus, $k = 3$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
