  "math_problem": "Let \\(P(x)\\) be a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients. Suppose that \\(P(1)=20, P(-1)=22\\), and \\(P(P(0))=400\\). Compute the largest possible value of \\(P(10)\\). Instead of finding the maximum possible evaluation of the quadratic at a designated point, simply find \\(k = b + 3\\), where \\(b\\) is the linear coefficient of the polynomial as determined by the given evaluation conditions. If $x, y$, and $z$ are real numbers such that $2 x^{k}+y^{k}+z^{2}=2 x-4 y+2 x z-5$, find the maximum possible value of $x-y+z$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, consider the quadratic polynomial $P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. Given $P(1) = 20$ and $P(-1) = 22$, we derive the equations:\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{cases}\\na + b + c = 20 \\\\\\\\\\na - b + c = 22\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n$$\\nSubtracting these gives $2b = -2 \\\\implies b = -1$. Thus, $k = b + 3 = -1 + 3 = 2$.\\n\\nNext, substitute $k = 2$ into the equation $2x^k + y^k + z^2 = 2x - 4y + 2xz - 5$, yielding:\\n$$\\n2x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2x - 4y + 2xz - 5\\n$$\\nRearranging terms:\\n$$\\n2x^2 - 2xz - 2x + y^2 + 4y + z^2 + 5 = 0\\n$$\\nCompleting the square for $x$, $y$, and $z$:\\n- Group $x$ and $z$ terms: $2x^2 - 2xz - 2x = 2\\\\left(x - \\\\frac{z+1}{2}\\\\right)^2 - \\\\frac{(z+1)^2}{2}$\\n- Simplify $z$-related terms: $-\\\\frac{(z+1)^2}{2} + z^2 = \\\\frac{1}{2}(z - 1)^2 - 1$\\n- Complete the square for $y$: $y^2 + 4y + 4 = (y + 2)^2$\\n\\nThis results in:\\n$$\\n2\\\\left(x - \\\\frac{z+1}{2}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2}(z - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 0\\n$$\\nSince all terms are non-negative, each must be zero:\\n- $z = 1$, $y = -2$, $x = \\\\frac{z+1}{2} = 1$\\n\\nThus, $x - y + z = 1 - (-2) + 1 = 4$, which is the only possible value and hence the maximum.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4\"\n}",
