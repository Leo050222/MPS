  "math_problem": "A point $(x, y)$ is selected uniformly at random from the unit square $S=\\{(x, y) \\mid 0 \\leq x \\leq 1,0 \\leq y \\leq 1\\}$. If the probability that $(3x+2y, x+4y)$ is in $S$ is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a+b$. Instead of computing the numerical identifier from the fractional probability that the transformed point remains within the unit square, simply find $k=$ area$(R) + 1553/120$, where area$(R)$ is the measure of the subset of the unit square on which both components of the linear transformation are at most 1. In bridge, a standard 52-card deck is dealt in the usual way to 4 players. By convention, each hand is assigned a number of \"points\" based on the formula $$4 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~A} \\text {'s })+3 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~K} \\text {'s })+2 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{Q} \\text {'s })+1 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~J} \\text {'s })$$ Given that a particular hand has exactly 4 cards that are A, K, Q, or J, find the probability that its point value is $k$ or higher.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the area(R) where both components of the transformation (3x + 2y, x + 4y) are ≤ 1 within the unit square. The region R is bounded by 3x + 2y ≤ 1, x + 4y ≤ 1, x ≥ 0, and y ≥ 0. Solving the system of equations, the intersection of the lines is (1/5, 1/5). The vertices of R are (0, 0), (1/3, 0), (1/5, 1/5), and (0, 1/4). Using the shoelace formula, the area of R is calculated as 7/120. Then, k = area(R) + 1553/120 = 7/120 + 1553/120 = 1560/120 = 13.\\n\\nNext, for the bridge problem, we need the probability that a hand with exactly 4 honor cards (A, K, Q, J) has a point value ≥ 13. The point value is calculated as 4a + 3k + 2q + j where a + k + q + j = 4. Valid combinations with point value ≥ 13 are:\\n- (4,0,0,0): 1 way\\n- (3,1,0,0), (3,0,1,0), (3,0,0,1): 16 each (total 48)\\n- (2,2,0,0), (2,1,1,0): 36 and 96 (total 132)\\n- (1,3,0,0): 16\\n\\nTotal favorable combinations: 1 + 48 + 132 + 16 = 197. Total possible combinations of 4 honor cards from 16 is C(16,4) = 1820. The probability is 197/1820, which is reduced since 197 is prime and does not divide 1820.\",\n    \"answer\": \"197/1820\"\n}",
