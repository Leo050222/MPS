  "math_problem": "Let $N$ be a positive integer. A collection of $4N^2$ unit tiles with two segments drawn on them as shown is assembled into a $2N\\times2N$ board. Tiles can be rotated.\n[asy]size(1.5cm);draw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle);draw((0,0.5)--(0.5,0),red);draw((0.5,1)--(1,0.5),red);[/asy]\nThe  segments  on  the  tiles  define  paths  on  the  board. Determine  the  least  possible  number  and  the largest possible number of such paths. Instead of determining the minimal and maximal possible numbers of paths formed by the segments on the assembled board, simply find $k = f(1) - 2$, where $f(1)$ is the maximum possible number of such paths when $N=1$. You are trapped in a room with only one exit, a long hallway with a series of doors and land mines. To get out you must open all the doors and disarm all the mines. In the room is a panel with 3 buttons, which conveniently contains an instruction manual. The red button arms a mine, the yellow button disarms two mines and closes a door, and the green button opens two doors. Initially $k$ doors are closed and $k$ mines are armed. The manual warns that attempting to disarm two mines or open two doors when only one is armed/closed will reset the system to its initial state. What is the minimum number of buttons you must push to get out?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the maximum number of paths for N=1. A 2x2 board with 4 tiles, each having two segments. Each tile can be rotated, and paths are formed by connected segments. By analyzing tile orientations, the maximum number of paths (f(1)) is found to be 5 (4 single-segment perimeter paths and 1 cycle of 4 internal segments). Thus, k = f(1) - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3.\\n\\nNext, solve the button problem with k=3 (3 closed doors, 3 armed mines). Buttons: red arms a mine, yellow disarms two mines and closes a door (requires ≥2 mines), green opens two doors (requires ≥2 doors). Using equations for state transitions:\\n- Doors: 3 + y - 2g = 0 ⇒ y = 2g - 3\\n- Mines: 3 + x - 2y = 0 ⇒ x = 2y - 3\\n\\nMinimum non-negative integers: g=3, y=3, x=3. Total presses: 3+3+3=9. Valid sequence (e.g., R, R, R, Y, Y, Y, G, G, G) avoids resets and reaches (0,0).\",\n    \"answer\": \"9\"\n}",
