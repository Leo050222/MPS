Ace through 10 are worth 1 to 10 points respectively, and the face cards King, Queen, and Jack are each worth 10 points. The probability that the sum of the point values of the cards drawn is a multiple of 10 can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing a hundred times the numerator plus the denominator of the fraction representing the probability in lowest terms, simply find $k = d + 0$, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that probability fraction."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability that the sum of three card draws (with replacement) is a multiple of 10 is calculated using modular arithmetic and generating functions. The key insight is recognizing that the characteristic function for residues modulo 10 simplifies due to symmetry. The probability simplifies to $\\\\frac{244}{2197}$, which is in lowest terms (gcd(244, 2197) = 1). The problem instructs to find $k = d + 0$ where $d$ is the gcd of numerator and denominator, so $k = 1 + 0 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The functional equation $\\\\frac{P(2x)}{P(x+1)} = 8 - \\\\frac{56}{x+7}$ simplifies to $\\\\frac{8x}{x+7}$. Assuming $P(x)$ is a cubic polynomial (degree analysis confirms this), we find $P(x) = \\\\frac{1}{21}x(x+2)(x+6)$ using root analysis and the condition $P(1) = 1$. Evaluating at $x = -1$ gives $P(-1) = -\\\\frac{5}{21}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-5/21\"\n}",
