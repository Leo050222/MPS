Substituting $y = 1 - x$, the expression becomes a quartic in $x$. Differentiating and solving shows a critical point at $x = y = 1/2$, yielding the value $-1/8$. Checking interior points and other boundaries confirms this is the global minimum. Adding $\\\\frac{401}{8}$ gives $k = -\\\\frac{1}{8} + \\\\frac{401}{8} = 50$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For $\\\\gcd(n^n + 50, n + 1) = 1$, use modular arithmetic: $n \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod (n + 1)$, so $n^n \\\\equiv (-1)^n \\\\mod (n + 1)$. Thus, $\\\\gcd(n + 1, (-1)^n + 50) = 1$. Split into cases:\\n- If $n$ is odd ($n + 1$ even), $\\\\gcd(m, 49) = 1$ (i.e., $m$ not divisible by 7).\\n- If $n$ is even ($n + 1$ odd), $\\\\gcd(m, 51) = 1$ (i.e., $m$ not divisible by 3 or 17).\\nCounting favorable $n$ in $\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, 2023!\\\\}$ (where $2023!$ is divisible by all small integers) gives probability $\\\\frac{3}{7} + \\\\frac{16}{51} = \\\\frac{265}{357}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"50\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"265/357\"\n}",
