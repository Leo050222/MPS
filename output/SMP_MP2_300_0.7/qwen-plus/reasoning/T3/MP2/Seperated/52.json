      "A1138": "The country of HMMTLand has 8 cities. Its government decides to construct several two-way roads between pairs of distinct cities. After they finish construction, it turns out that each city can reach exactly 3 other cities via a single road, and from any pair of distinct cities, either exactly 0 or 2 other cities can be reached from both cities by a single road. Compute the number of ways HMMTLand could have constructed the roads. Instead of computing the total number of possible road constructions satisfying the conditions, simply find $e = N - 833$, where $N$ is the number of connected road constructions satisfying the conditions."

The only such connected graph is the 3-dimensional hypercube (Q3). The number of labeled copies of Q3 is calculated by dividing the total permutations of 8 vertices (8!) by the size of its automorphism group (48), yielding 840. Thus, N = 840, and e = N - 833 = 7.\\n\\nProblem 2: For √x, √(x+7), and √(10−x) to form a non-degenerate triangle, all triangle inequalities must hold strictly. Solving these inequalities shows the valid interval for x is (0.2, 9). The length of this interval is 8.8, and the total interval length is 10. The probability is 8.8/10 = 22/25.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"7\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"22/25\"\n}",
