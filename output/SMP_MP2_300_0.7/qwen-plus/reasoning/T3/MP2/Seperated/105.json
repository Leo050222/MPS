Computing initial terms reveals a pattern: primes 3 and 5 each appear 4 times, while primes ≥7 appear 6 times. Tracking cumulative terms:\\n- Terms 1-2: initial values.\\n- Prime 3: terms 3-6 (4 terms).\\n- Prime 5: terms 7-10 (4 terms).\\n- Prime 7: terms 11-16 (6 terms).\\n- Prime 11: terms 17-22 (6 terms).\\n- Continuing this pattern, primes 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59 each add 6 terms. Cumulative terms up to prime 59: 94. Prime 61 starts at term 95 and spans terms 95-100 (6 terms). Thus, a₉₉=61. Therefore, k = a₉₉ - 51 = 61 - 51 = 10.\\n\\nProblem 2: For 5 lattice points with no three collinear, the area of a triangle is >1/2 iff its determinant (from shoelace formula) is ≥2. The maximum number of triangles with area 1/2 (determinant 1) is 6, achieved by configurations like {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,3)}. This leaves 10 - 6 = 4 triangles with area >1/2. Known results confirm this is the minimum possible.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4\"\n}",
