Let $ r = P(1) $, $ s = P(2) $. Then $ r + s = -b $, $ rs = c $, and $ r = 1 + b + c $, $ s = 4 + 2b + c $. Solving these equations yields $ r = -1 $, $ s = \\\\frac{3}{2} $, so $ b = -\\\\frac{1}{2} $, $ c = -\\\\frac{3}{2} $. Thus, $ k = c + \\\\frac{4037}{2} = -\\\\frac{3}{2} + \\\\frac{4037}{2} = 2017 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need $ N > 2017 $ such that exactly 40% of numbers from 1 to $ N $ have leftmost digit 1. The count of such numbers $ C(N) $ must satisfy $ C(N) = 0.4N $. Analyzing intervals where leftmost digit 1 occurs (e.g., [1,1], [10,19], [100,199], etc.), the smallest $ N > 2017 $ satisfying $ 5C(N) = 2N $ is found in the 7-digit range. The solution arises when $ N = 1481480 $, where $ C(N) = 592592 $ and $ 0.4 \\\\times 1481480 = 592592 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2017\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1481480\"\n}",
