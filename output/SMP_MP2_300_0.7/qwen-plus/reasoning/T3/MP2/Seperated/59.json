If Jude continues flipping forever, let $p$ be the probability that he flips 3 heads in a row at some point. Compute $\\lfloor 180 p\\rfloor$. Instead of computing the floor of 180 times the probability of eventually flipping three heads in a row, simply find $\\delta = p_5 - \\frac{53}{72}$, where $p_5$ is the probability that the fifth head is preceded by a tail and that no three consecutive heads have occurred in the sequence up to the fifth head, as derived from analyzing the process to avoid three consecutive heads."

Using recurrence relations for states based on the number of heads (h) and current run length (r=1 or 2, avoiding r=3), we calculate f(h, r) as the probability of being in state (h, r) without three consecutive heads. For h=5, f(5, 1) = 53/72, which is p_5. Thus, δ = 53/72 - 53/72 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: We count non-self-intersecting concave quadrilaterals with vertices (0,0), (1,0), and two distinct lattice points (a,b), (c,d) where 0 ≤ a,c ≤ 59 and 1 ≤ b,d ≤ 5. A concave quadrilateral occurs when one upper point is inside the triangle formed by the other three. By analyzing conditions for a point (a,b) to be inside triangle (0,0), (1,0), (c,d) (and vice versa), we sum valid pairs for all (b,d) with b < d. The total is 20 (for (1,3)) + 30 (for (1,4)) + 36 (for (1,5)) + 24 (for (2,5)) + 12 (for (3,5)) = 122.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"122\"\n}",
