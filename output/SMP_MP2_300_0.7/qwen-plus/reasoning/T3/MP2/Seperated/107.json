Assuming $m < 0$ and $n > 0$, let $m = -k$ ($k > 0$), leading to $k^5 + n^5 = 16kn$. Testing small positive integers, we find $(k, n) = (2, 2)$ satisfies the equation, giving $(m, n) = (-2, 2)$. Here, $n = 2$ (positive), so $k = n - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For the polynomial with roots $p < q < r$ and $pqr = 48$, we minimize $\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$. Using Lagrange multipliers, we find the optimal values occur when $q = 2p$ and $r = 3p$, leading to $p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$. Substituting these values gives $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{3}{2}$, which is the minimum.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
