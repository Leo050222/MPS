For primes a,b,c:\\n- If c ≠ 3, then 16c² ≡ 1 mod 3, so a² + b² ≡ 0 mod 3 ⇒ a = b = 3 (only primes divisible by 3).\\n- Substituting a = b = 3 gives 9 + 9 + 16c² = 9k² + 1 ⇒ 16c² + 17 = 9k².\\n- Rewrite as (3k)² - (4c)² = 17 ⇒ (3k - 4c)(3k + 4c) = 17 (prime).\\n- Factor pairs: 1 × 17. Solving gives 3k - 4c = 1 and 3k + 4c = 17 ⇒ c = 2 (prime).\\n- Thus, m = c + 288 = 2 + 288 = 290.\\n\\nProblem 2: Trailing zeros in n! are given by Z(n) = ⌊n/5⌋ + ⌊n/25⌋ + ⌊n/125⌋ + ⌊n/625⌋ + ...\\n- Need Z(n) = 290. Testing values:\\n  - Z(1169) = 233 + 46 + 9 + 1 = 289\\n  - Z(1170) = 234 + 46 + 9 + 1 = 290\\n- Smallest n is 1170.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"290\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1170\"\n}",
