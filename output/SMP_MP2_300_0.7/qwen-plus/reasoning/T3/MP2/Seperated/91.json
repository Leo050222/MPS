The distance from vertex $A$ to face $B C D$ can be written as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are positive integers, $b$ is square-free, and $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$. Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of computing the encoded value $100a + 10b + c$ from the parameters of the distance expression, simply find $d = \\gcd(a, c) + 0$, where $a, b, c$ are the positive integers such that the distance is $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$ with $b$ square-free and $\\gcd(a, c)=1$."

The volume of tetrahedron ABCD is found to be 48 via scalar triple product. The area of face BCD is 6√41 using Heron's formula. The height (distance) is 3*Volume / Area = 24√41 / 41. Here, a=24, b=41, c=41 with gcd(a,c)=1. The problem asks for d = gcd(a,c) + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The quadratic form factors as (3x + y)(x + 3y). For this product to be a prime power, both factors must be powers of the same prime. Analysis shows only prime 2 is possible. Cases:\\n- x = y: 16x² is prime power ⇒ x = 2^m (11 values, m=0 to 10).\\n- x > y: x=5*2^t, y=2^t (9 values, t=0 to 8).\\n- x < y: x=2^t, y=5*2^t (9 values, t=0 to 8).\\nTotal ordered pairs: 11 + 9 + 9 = 29.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"29\"\n}",
