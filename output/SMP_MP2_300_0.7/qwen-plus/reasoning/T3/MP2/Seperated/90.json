The sum of the possible values of $r$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100a+b$. Instead of computing the numerical value obtained by multiplying the numerator by 100 and adding the denominator of the reduced fractional representation of the sum of the possible parameter values, simply find $m = b - 4$, where $b$ is that denominator."

Subtracting the two quadratics gives $(r+2)\\\\alpha + 16 = 0$, so $\\\\alpha = -16/(r+2)$ (for $r \\\\neq -2$). Substituting into the first quadratic yields $5r^2 - 4r - 156 = 0$. The sum of roots is $4/5$, so $a=4$, $b=5$. Then $m = b - 4 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using induction and LTE for $p=2$, $v_2(3^{2^k} - 1) = k + 2$. For $3^{512} - 1 = 3^{2^9} - 1$, $k=9$, so $v_2 = 9 + 2 = 11$. Thus the largest $n$ is 11.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
