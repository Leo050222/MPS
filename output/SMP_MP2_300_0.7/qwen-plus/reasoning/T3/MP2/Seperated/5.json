Instead of computing the circumradius of the cyclic hexagon with the specified side lengths, simply find $k = d - 15$, where $d$ is the length of the diameter of the circumcircle derived from the geometric construction ensuring the points are concyclic."

The total central angles sum to 2π, so α + β + γ = π. Using the chord length formula (chord length = 2R sin(θ/2)), we derive equations: sin(α/2) = 1/R, sin(β/2) = 9/(2R), sin(γ/2) = 6/R. Letting x = α/2, y = β/2, z = γ/2, we have x + y + z = π/2. Using the identity cos(x + y) = sin(z), we substitute and simplify to get an equation in R. Solving leads to R = 8 (valid after checking extraneous roots), so diameter d = 16. Thus, k = d - 15 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let c = P(1). The polynomial equation implies P(t) = c t² + P(c) t + P(P(c)). Assuming P is quadratic (higher degrees are invalid), we find constraints: c = P(1), m = P(c), n = P(m), and m + n = 0. Solving gives two cases: the zero polynomial (yielding 0) and a non-zero quadratic with c = -1, m = -1/3, n = 1/3. Computing P(P(P(P(1)))) for this case: P(1) = -1, P(-1) = -1/3, P(-1/3) = 1/3, P(1/3) = 1/9. The largest value is 1/9.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/9\"\n}",
