Since $\\\\sqrt{4} = 2$ is a constant rational value, $k = 2 - 1 = 1$ regardless of the nested square root analysis.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let $\\\\alpha = 1 - \\\\sqrt[3]{2} + \\\\sqrt[3]{4}$. Let $\\\\beta = \\\\sqrt[3]{2}$, so $\\\\beta^3 = 2$ and $\\\\alpha = \\\\beta^2 - \\\\beta + 1$. Multiplying $\\\\alpha$ by $\\\\beta + 1$ gives $\\\\alpha(\\\\beta + 1) = \\\\beta^3 + 1 = 3$, so $\\\\beta = \\\\frac{3}{\\\\alpha} - 1$. Substituting into $\\\\beta^3 = 2$ and simplifying yields the cubic equation $\\\\alpha^3 - 3\\\\alpha^2 + 9\\\\alpha - 9 = 0$. This monic polynomial with integer coefficients is irreducible over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ (verified via Rational Root Theorem), making it the minimal degree polynomial satisfying the condition.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"x^3-3x^2+9x-9\"\n}",
