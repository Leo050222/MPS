Considering parity and modular constraints, we find that $p$ and $q$ must both be odd primes. Testing small primes, we find that $p = 5$, $q = 3$ satisfies the equation when $r = 19$ (a prime). Verifying: $3(5^4) - 5(3^4) - 4(19^2) = 1875 - 405 - 1444 = 26$. Thus, $r = 19$, so $m = r - 16 = 3$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For triangle $ABC$ with perimeter 1, let sides be $a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c$ (so $\\\\min(AB, BC, CA) = a$). The altitudes $h_a, h_b, h_c$ form a triangle iff $h_b + h_c > h_a$, which simplifies to $a(1 - a) > bc$. Using triangle inequalities and optimization, the valid range for $a$ is derived as $\\\\left( \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{5}}{4}, \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\right]$. The lower bound is exclusive (degenerate triangle at equality), and the upper bound $\\\\frac{1}{3}$ is inclusive (equilateral triangle).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"((3 - sqrt(5))/4, 1/3]\"\n}",
