Factoring gives $(b-a)(b+a) = 1111 = 11 \\\\times 101$. Solving $b-a=11$ and $b+a=101$ yields $a=45$, $b=56$. Thus $n=45^2=2025$, and $m = 45 - 42 = 3$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The divisor $x^3-6x^2+11x-6 = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$. The remainder $R(x)$ is quadratic: $R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. Using given remainders: $R(1)=-4$, $R(2)=-1$, $R(3)=4$. Solving the system gives $a=1$, $b=0$, $c=-5$, so $R(x) = x^2 - 5$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"x^2 - 5\"\n}",
