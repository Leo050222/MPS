First, compute $ f(1) = \\\\frac{1}{9} $ and $ f'(1) = \\\\frac{2}{27} $. The tangent line is $ L(t) = \\\\frac{2t + 1}{27} $. The difference $ L(t) - f(t) $ has numerator $ 2t^4 + t^3 - 11t + 8 $. Evaluating $ p(1) = 2(1)^4 + (1)^3 - 11(1) + 8 = 0 $, so $ k = 0 + 1 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Solve $ x^n - y^n = 2^{100} $ for positive integers $ x, y, n $ with $ n > 1 $. For $ n = 2 $, factor as $ (x - y)(x + y) = 2^{100} $. Both factors must be powers of 2, leading to $ x - y = 2^a $, $ x + y = 2^b $ with $ a + b = 100 $ and $ a < b $. Valid $ a $ ranges from 1 to 49 (49 solutions). For $ n \\\\geq 3 $, using Mih\\u0103ilescu's theorem and modular arithmetic, no solutions exist. Thus, only 49 ordered triples.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"49\"\n}",
