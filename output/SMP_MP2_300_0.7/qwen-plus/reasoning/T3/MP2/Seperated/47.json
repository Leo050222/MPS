Thus, $ d = 1 + 0 = 1 $. Problem 2: To find the largest $ n $ such that $ 2^n $ divides $ 7^{2048} - 1 $, we use the Lifting The Exponent (LTE) lemma for $ p = 2 $. For even $ n $, $ v_2(7^n - 1) = 3 + v_2(n) $. Here, $ n = 2048 = 2^{11} $, so $ v_2(2048) = 11 $. Thus, $ v_2(7^{2048} - 1) = 3 + 11 = 14 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"14\"\n}",
