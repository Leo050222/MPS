Instead of finding the area of the triangle, simply find $k = x - 3$, where $x$ is the scaling factor such that the side lengths are $5x$ for the longest side, $4x$ for the middle-length side, and $3x$ for the shortest side."

Given altitudes 12, 15, 20, the sides are proportional to 1/12, 1/15, 1/20, simplifying to 5:4:3. Let sides be 5x, 4x, 3x. The area via the right triangle (3-4-5) is (3x)(4x)/2 = 6x². Using the altitude to the longest side (5x): Area = (5x)(12)/2 = 30x. Equating 6x² = 30x gives x = 5. Thus, k = x - 3 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let t = 10/(a² + b²). The system becomes linear in a, b: a + tv = 5, b + tu = 4. Solving yields a = (5 - 4t)/(1 - t²), b = (4 - 5t)/(1 - t²). Substituting t = 10/(a² + b²) leads to a quartic equation in t, solved as t = 2, 1/2, (4±3i)/5. Each t gives valid (a, b): (1, 2), (4, 2), (5/2, 2 - 3i/2), (5/2, 2 + 3i/2). All satisfy the original equations and a² + b² ≠ 0.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(1, 2), (4, 2), (5/2, 2 - 3i/2), (5/2, 2 + 3i/2)\"\n}",
