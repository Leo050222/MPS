For example, $r(2023)=r\\left(11111100111_{2}\\right)=11100111111_{2}=1855$.

Instead of determining whether such a progression exists, simply find $e = \\delta + 19$, where $\\delta$ is the binary digit in the third of three consecutive terms with equal binary length at the minimal bit position $j \\geq 1$ where the binary representations of the first and second of those terms differ, derived from the arithmetic progression relation among the original terms."

For an arithmetic progression of odd integers with even common difference $ d $, the minimal $ j $ where consecutive terms differ is the position of the least significant set bit in $ d $. In the earliest valid triplet (e.g., $ a = 9 $, $ d = 2 $), the third term's bit at $ j = 2 $ is 0, so $ \\\\delta = 0 $. Thus, $ e = 0 + 19 = 19 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Subsets $ S $ must have 19 elements where no non-empty subset sum is divisible by 20. Valid subsets must have all elements congruent to a residue $ r \\\\mod 20 $ with $ \\\\gcd(r, 20) = 1 $ (8 such residues: 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19).
