Simplifying, $a = r + 1 + \\\\frac{1}{r - 1}$, so $r - 1$ must divide 1. The integer solutions are $r - 1 = 1$ (yielding $r = 2$, $a = 4$) and $r - 1 = -1$ (yielding $r = 0$, $a = 0$, invalid as $a$ must be positive). Thus, only $a = 4$ works, so there is 1 positive integer $a$. Adding 42 gives $k = 43$.\\n\\nProblem 2: A $13 \\\\times 13$ board has 169 squares; leaving the central square uncovered leaves 168 squares, which is divisible by 4 (42 tiles). Using a column-based 4-coloring (color $j \\\\mod 4$ for column $j$), the counts after removing the central square (column 6, color 2) are: color 0: 52, color 1: 39, color 2: 38, color 3: 39. Horizontal tiles cover one of each color, vertical tiles cover 4 of one color. The difference between color 1 and color 2 is 1, but this difference must be a multiple of 4 (since vertical tiles change counts by multiples of 4 and horizontal tiles preserve differences). As 1 is not divisible by 4, tiling is impossible.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"43\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
