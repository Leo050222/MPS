Instead of finding all real parameters $k$ such that the quartic equation has exactly one real solution $r$, simply find $e = \\kappa + \\frac{40009}{4}$, where $\\kappa$ is the value of $k$ for which the unique real root is positive, derived from the factorization analysis of the polynomial."

For a unique positive real root, one quadratic must have a double root at r = 2 (positive), requiring a = -4. This gives c = 7/4 and k = -9/4. Thus, e = -9/4 + 40009/4 = 10000.\\n\\nProblem 2: The sum of digits from 1 to 799 is calculated by breaking into units, tens, and hundreds places. Units and tens each sum to 3600, hundreds sum to 2800, totaling 10,000. Hence, n = 799.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10000\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"799\"\n}",
