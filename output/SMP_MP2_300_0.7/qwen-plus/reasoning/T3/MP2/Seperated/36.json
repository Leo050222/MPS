A perfectutation is a bijective function $h$ from $S$ to itself such that there exists an $a \\in S$ such that $h(a) \\neq a$, and that for any pair of integers $a \\in S$ and $b \\in S$ such that $h(a) \\neq a, h(b) \\neq b$, there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $h^{k}(a)=b$. Let $n$ be the number of ordered pairs of perfectutations $(f, g)$ such that $f(g(i))=g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in S$, but $f \\neq g$. Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by 2011 . Instead of determining the remainder when the number of ordered pairs of distinct commuting perfectutations is divided by the prime, simply find $m = p - 2010$, where $p$ is that prime."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The problem defines a perfectutation as a permutation with exactly one non-trivial cycle (length ≥2). The key insight is that the problem asks for m = p - 2010 where p is the prime modulus 2011 (since 2011 is prime and the remainder is computed modulo 2011). Thus, p = 2011, so m = 2011 - 2010 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: For n=4, a valid construction exists (e.g., X₁=∅, X₂={a}, X₃={b,c}, X₄={d,e}), satisfying all triple union conditions. For n=5, contradictions arise in required union sizes (e.g., |X₂∪X₃∪X₅| must be 6 but constraints limit it to ≤5). Larger n fail due to growth rate mismatches between √(abc) and achievable union sizes. Thus, the maximum n is 4.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4\"\n}",
