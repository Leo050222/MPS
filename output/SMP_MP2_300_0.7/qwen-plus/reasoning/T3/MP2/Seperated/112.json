Each block rests on 4 smaller blocks, each with dimensions half those of the larger block. Laura removes blocks one at a time from this stack, removing only blocks that currently have no blocks on top of them.

Solving $a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2 = 1$ gives $(a - b)^2 + b^2 = 1$. Positive integers yield $a = 1$, $b = 1$, resulting in $1^4 + 4(1)^4 = 5$, which is prime. Other values produce composite numbers.\\n\\nProblem 2: The stack is a 4-ary tree with 4 layers. Laura removes 5 blocks, starting with the root (layer 1). Valid sequences depend on dependencies (parent must be removed before child). Cases based on layers removed:\\n- (4,0,0): 24 sequences\\n- (3,1,0): 576\\n- (2,2,0): 1152\\n- (2,1,1): 768\\n- (1,3,0): 96\\n- (1,2,1): 576\\n- (1,1,2): 192\\nTotal: 24 + 576 + 1152 + 768 + 96 + 576 + 192 = 3384.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3384\"\n}",
