If each player chooses their roles randomly, what is the probability that each role will have exactly two players? Instead of computing the probability that every role is selected by precisely two players, simply find $e = T(favorable) - 1940$, where $T(favorable)$ is the total number of favorable outcomes where each role receives exactly two choices."

This corresponds to counting 5x5 (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums equal to 2. The known value for this count (from combinatorial sequence A001499) is 2040. Thus, T(favorable) = 2040. Then e = 2040 - 1940 = 100.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need the smallest n where the average of ||k|| (absolute difference to nearest square) from k=1 to n is 100. Analyzing the sum structure, for M=299, the interval after 299² (89401) up to 300²-1 (89999) is considered. Solving S(n) = 100n within this interval, the smallest n is found at t=399 (n = 299² + 399 = 89800), where the sum equals 100n exactly. Previous values have averages less than 100.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"89800\"\n}",
