Using Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = -1$ and $x_1x_2 = -A$. The third equation $x_1^4 + 3x_1^3 + 5x_1 = x_2^4 + 3x_2^3 + 5x_2$ simplifies by expressing higher powers of $x$ in terms of lower ones using $x^2 = -x + A$. Substituting, $f(x) = x^4 + 3x^3 + 5x$ becomes $(7 + A)x + (A^2 - 2A)$. For $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ with $x_1 \\\\neq x_2$, we require $7 + A = 0$, so $A = -7$. Thus, $k = A + 9 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The sum $\\\\sum_{n=2}^{17} \\\\frac{n^2 + n + 1}{n^4 + 2n^3 - n^2 - 2n}$ is simplified by factoring the denominator as $n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2)$.
