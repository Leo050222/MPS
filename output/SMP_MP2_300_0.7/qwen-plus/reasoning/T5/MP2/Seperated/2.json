Analysis shows this remainder equals $ 2^{(2^n \\\\mod n)} $. For $ n = 25 $, $ 2^{25} \\\\mod 25 = 7 $, which is odd, making the remainder $ 2^7 = 128 $, not a power of 4 (counter-example). Here, $ r = 7 $, so $ k = r - 5 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Testing constant, linear, and quadratic functions reveals only $ f(x) = 0 $ and $ f(x) = x $ satisfy the functional equation. Verification confirms these are the only solutions. Substituting $ f(x) = 0 $ or $ f(x) = x $ into the equation holds for all integers $ a, b, c $, while other forms fail.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=0 and f(x)=x\"\n}",
