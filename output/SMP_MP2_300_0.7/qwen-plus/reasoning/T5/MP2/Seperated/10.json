The greatest common divisor (gcd) of these distinct prime factors is gcd(43, 47) = 1. The problem instructs to compute k = d - 1 where d is this gcd, so k = 1 - 1 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize the sum S = ∑_{n=1}^∞ (n / 2^n)(a₁a₂⋯aₙ)^{1/n} under ∑aₖ = 1, consider the sequence aₖ = y^{2k-1} where y = (√5 - 1)/2 (satisfying ∑aₖ = 1). This leads to (a₁⋯aₙ)^{1/n} = yⁿ. The sum becomes ∑n(y/2)ⁿ = (y/2)/(1 - y/2)². Substituting y and simplifying yields (√5 + 1)/5, which is the maximum value.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(sqrt(5)+1)/5\"\n}",
