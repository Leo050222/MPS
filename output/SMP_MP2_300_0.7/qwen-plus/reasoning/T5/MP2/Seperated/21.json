Since gcd(2f(1)-1, 2f(1)) = 1, the only possibility is 2f(1) - 1 = 1, so f(1) = 1. Thus κ = f(1) - 1 = 0. Further checks with f(n) = n² confirm it satisfies the condition, and f(1) must be 1, so κ = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: We construct a sequence F where F(1) = 0 (to include 0), and for n ≥ 2, partition N≥2 into sequences closed under 163rd powers. Assign each sequence to a positive integer m, ensuring each m occurs infinitely often. Define F(n) = m for n in the m-th sequence. Then F(F(n^163)) = F(F(n)) since F(n^163) = F(n), satisfying condition (c) with C = 0. Conditions (a) and (b) are met as all non-negative integers occur and positive integers repeat infinitely.
