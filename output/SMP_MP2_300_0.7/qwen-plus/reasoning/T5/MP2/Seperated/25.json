For a = 0, the constant term fails (0 = 2014). For a = 2, b = 1007 satisfies the equation. Thus, the coefficient a is 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Testing constant functions, f(x) = 0 works. Assuming f is linear, f(x) = kx leads to k = 0 or 1. Verifying f(x) = x satisfies the equation. Non-linear or other solutions lead to contradictions. Thus, the solutions are f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x\"\n}",
