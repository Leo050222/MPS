For degree 3, the polynomial T₃(2x - 1) = 32x³ - 48x² + 18x - 1 equioscillates between -1 and 1 at four points (0, 1/4, 3/4, 1), satisfying the root condition (it has three roots in [0,1]). This polynomial is normalized to have max |P(x)| = 1 on [0,1]. Evaluating at x=1 gives P(1) = 1, which is the value α.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given p is a monic polynomial of degree 2n with p(1/k) = k² for 1 ≤ |k| ≤ n, we define g(x) = x^{2n}p(1/x) - x^{2n+2}. This polynomial has roots at x = ±1, ..., ±n (from the given conditions) and two additional roots. The product of all roots (in terms of y = x²) must equal 1 due to the constant term of g(x). The product of the given roots (y = k² for k=1 to n) is (n!)², so the remaining root is y = 1/(n!)², leading to x = ±1/n! as the other solutions.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"±1/n!\"\n}",
