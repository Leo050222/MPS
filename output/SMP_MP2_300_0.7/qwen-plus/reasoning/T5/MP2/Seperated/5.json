This is because any two non-adjacent vertices must share a common neighbor (to form a triangle upon edge addition), ensuring distance 2. The star graph (with 2018 edges) is excluded since |E| > 2018, but all other maximal triangle-free graphs (e.g., complete bipartite graphs with partitions ≥2) still have diameter 2. Thus, diam(G) = 2, so d = 2 - 2 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume f is constant. Substituting x = y = z = 1 gives 3f(2) = 1 ⇒ f(2) = 1/3. Testing f(x) = 1/3 satisfies the equation for all x, y, z with xyz = 1. To check uniqueness, define g(x) = f(x) - 1/3. The functional equation becomes g(x + 1/y) + g(y + 1/z) + g(z + 1/x) = 0. Using substitutions (e.g., y = 1, z = 1/x), we derive 2g(x + 1) + g(2/x) = 0. Iterating this shows g(x) = 0 for all x, proving f(x) = 1/3 is the only solution.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/3\"\n}",
