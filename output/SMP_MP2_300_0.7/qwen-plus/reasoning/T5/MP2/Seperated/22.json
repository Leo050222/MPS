Testing constant functions, f(x) = c satisfies the equation if 2c = c², so c = 2 (since c ≠ 0). Non-constant functions lead to contradictions, so c = 2. Thus, d = c - 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume f is quadratic. Testing f(x) = x² + 1 satisfies the equation for all x, y. Verifying coefficients shows it's the only solution. Other forms (constant, linear) fail. Thus, the function is f(x) = x² + 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"x^2 + 1\"\n}",
