  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We analyze the functional equation $ f(xf(y) + y^3) = yf(x) + f(y)^3 $. First, constant functions are checked: $ f(y) = 0 $ is a solution, but we need the non-constant one. Assuming $ f $ is non-constant, we find $ f(0) = 0 $ and $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $. Testing linear functions, $ f(x) = x $ satisfies the equation. Verifying $ f(1) = 1 $, we compute $ k = f(1) + 1 = 2 $. Other potential values for $ f(1) $ (like $ -1 $) lead to contradictions, confirming $ f(1) = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: We consider whether a finite set $ A $ (size ≥ 2) and infinite set $ B $ exist such that $ A+B $ has pairwise coprime elements and hits every coprime residue class. For $ A+B $ to have pairwise coprime elements, all elements must be distinct primes (or 1, but 1 is excluded). However, condition 2 requires $ A+B $ to intersect every coprime residue class mod $ m $ for any $ m $. A finite union of translates (from finite $ A $) cannot cover all $ \\\\phi(m) $ coprime residues for large $ m $, as $ \\\\phi(m) $ grows while the number of covered residues is bounded by $ |A| $. Thus, no such sets exist.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
