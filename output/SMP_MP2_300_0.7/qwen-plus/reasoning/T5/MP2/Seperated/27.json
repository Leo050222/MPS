For N=2011 (length of the sequence), any valid sequence would require the sum to be of the form C + D^{n+1} where C=1. However, with N≥3, additional terms (j≥3) contribute positive constants (since x_j ≥1), making the sum exceed D^{n+1} + 1 for all n. The only valid sequences exist for N=1 (sequence (1)) and N=2 (sequence (1,2)), but for N=2011, no such sequences exist due to the extra constant terms from j≥3.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"no such sequences\"\n}",
