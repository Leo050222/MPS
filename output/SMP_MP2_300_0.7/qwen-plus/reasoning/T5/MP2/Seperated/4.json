The variables are x₁ to x₂₀₀₂, so t = 2002. Calculating δ: 2002 - 4003/2 = (4004 - 4003)/2 = 1/2.\\n\\nProblem 2: We analyze the functional equation f(2xy + 1/2) + f(x - y) = 4f(x)f(y) + 1/2. Testing constant functions shows no solutions. Assuming f is quadratic and even (from substituting x=0), we find f(0) = 1/4 and f(1/2) = 1/2. Testing f(x) = x² + 1/4 satisfies the equation for all x, y ∈ ℚ. Further analysis confirms this is the only solution by transforming the equation and verifying uniqueness through polynomial structure and substitution tests.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = x^2 + 1/4\"\n}",
