How many red monochromatic triangles\nare there? Instead of determining the number of red monochromatic triangles, simply find $e = k - 39$, where $k$ is the number of possible third vertices that can form a triangle with any two given vertices of $P$."

Thus, k = 41. Then e = k - 39 = 41 - 39 = 2. The details about monochromatic triangles are irrelevant as the problem explicitly redirects to compute e based on k.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume f(x) = x + 1. Verify: f(xy + f(x)) = f(xy + x + 1) = xy + x + 2. Right-hand side: x f(y) + 2 = x(y + 1) + 2 = xy + x + 2. Equality holds. To confirm uniqueness, injectivity is proven by assuming f(a) = f(b) leading to a = b. Using x = 1 gives f(y + c) = f(y) + 2 (c = f(1)), suggesting linearity. Solving for linear form f(x) = ax + b yields a = 1, b = 1. No non-linear solutions exist due to constraints from the functional equation and injectivity.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"x+1\"\n}",
