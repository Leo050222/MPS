Assuming the reciprocal of f on [0,2) is linear, let g(x) = 1/f(x) = kx + c. Using f(0) = 1 (from x=0, y=0), we get c=1. Substituting into the functional equation and matching terms shows k = -1/2. Thus, α = k + 5/2 = (-1/2) + 5/2 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Testing constant and linear functions, the zero function satisfies the equation. For non-zero solutions, assuming f(x) = kx leads to k³ = k, giving k = 0, 1, -1. Verifying, f(x) = 0, f(x) = x, and f(x) = -x all satisfy the equation. Further analysis shows no other solutions exist, as non-linear or mixed sign functions fail the functional equation.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=0, f(x)=x, f(x)=-x\"\n}",
