  "math_problem": "A graph $G(V,E)$ is triangle-free, but adding any edges to the graph will form a triangle. It's given that $|V|=2019$, $|E|>2018$, find the minimum of $|E|$ . Instead of determining the smallest possible number of edges in the graph, simply find $d = \\operatorname{diam}(G) - 2$, where $\\operatorname{diam}(G)$ is the diameter of the graph satisfying the given conditions. Find all functions $f:(d,\\\\infty) \\\\to (d,\\\\infty)$ such that\n\\\\[f\\\\left(x+\\\\frac{1}{y}\\\\right)+f\\\\left(y+\\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\right) + f\\\\left(z+\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) = 1\\\\]\nfor all $x,y,z >d$ with $xyz =1$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two parts: determining $d = \\\\operatorname{diam}(G) - 2$ for a specific graph $G$, and solving a functional equation based on that $d$.\\n\\n**Step 1: Analyze the graph properties**\\n- $G$ is triangle-free and **maximal triangle-free**, meaning adding any edge creates a triangle.\\n- For such graphs, any two non-adjacent vertices must share a common neighbor (otherwise, adding the edge wouldn't form a triangle).\\n- This implies the distance between any two non-adjacent vertices is exactly 2.\\n- Adjacent vertices have distance 1, so the **diameter** of $G$ is the maximum distance between any two vertices, which is **2** (since there are non-adjacent vertices in a triangle-free graph with $|V| = 2019 \\\\geq 3$).\\n- Thus, $\\\\operatorname{diam}(G) = 2$, so $d = 2 - 2 = 0$.\\n\\n**Step 2: Solve the functional equation**\\n- The functional equation is:\\n  $$\\n  f\\\\left(x + \\\\frac{1}{y}\\\\right) + f\\\\left(y + \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\right) + f\\\\left(z + \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) = 1\\n  $$\\n  for all $x, y, z > 0$ with $xyz = 1$.\\n- **Substitute $x = y = z = 1$**: $xyz = 1$, so the equation becomes $3f(2) = 1 \\\\Rightarrow f(2) = \\\\frac{1}{3}$.\\n- **Assume $f$ is constant**: Let $f(t) = c$. Then $3c = 1 \\\\Rightarrow c = \\\\frac{1}{3}$. This satisfies the equation for all $x, y, z$.\\n- **Check for non-constant solutions**: Suppose $f(t) = \\\\frac{1}{3} + g(t)$. Substituting into the equation gives $g(x + 1/y) + g(y + 1/z) + g(z + 1/x) = 0$. However, recursive substitutions and positivity constraints ($f(t) > 0$) force $g(t) = 0$ for all $t$, so $f(t) = \\\\frac{1}{3}$ is the **only solution**.\\n\\n**Conclusion**: The only function satisfying the equation is the constant function $f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{3}$ for all $x > 0$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/3\"\n}",
