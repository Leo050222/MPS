Does there exist a finite set $A$ of positive integers of cardinality at least $k$ and an infinite set $B$ of positive integers, such that any two distinct elements in $A+B$ are coprime, and for any coprime positive integers $m,n$, there exists an element $x$ in $A+B$ satisfying $x\\equiv n \\pmod m$?\n\nHere $A+B=\\{a+b|a\\in A, b\\in B\\}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first analyze the functional equation:\\n\\n$$\\nf(xf(y) + y^3) = yf(x) + f(y)^3\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine $ f(1) $\\n\\nAssume $ f $ is non-constant. Let’s test for possible values of $ f(1) $.  \\n\\n- **Set $ x = 0 $:**  \\n  $$\\n  f(y^3) = y f(0) + f(y)^3\\n  $$\\n  If $ f(0) \\\\neq 0 $, then $ f $ would be constant (as shown in the reasoning), which contradicts the non-constant assumption. So $ f(0) = 0 $.  \\n\\n- **Set $ y = 1 $:**  \\n  $$\\n  f(x f(1) + 1) = f(x) + f(1)^3\\n  $$\\n  Let $ c = f(1) $. Then:\\n  $$\\n  f(cx + 1) = f(x) + c^3\\n  $$\\n  Setting $ x = 0 $ gives:\\n  $$\\n  f(1) = f(0) + c^3 \\\\Rightarrow c = c^3 \\\\Rightarrow c(c^2 - 1) = 0\\n  $$\\n  So $ c = 0, 1, -1 $.  \\n\\n- **Case $ c = 0 $:**  \\n  Then $ f(1) = 0 $, and the equation becomes $ f(1) = f(x) $ for all $ x $, implying $ f $ is constant — contradiction.  \\n\\n- **Case $ c = -1 $:**  \\n  Testing $ f(x) = -x $ fails to satisfy the original equation (as shown in the detailed analysis).  \\n\\n- **Case $ c = 1 $:**  \\n  The function $ f(x) = x $ satisfies the equation:\\n  $$\\n  f(xf(y) + y^3) = f(xy + y^3) = xy + y^3 = yx + y^3 = yf(x) + f(y)^3\\n  $$\\n  This works.  \\n\\nThus, the only valid non-constant solution has $ f(1) = 1 $, so:\\n$$\\nk = f(1) + 1 = 2\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 2: Analyze the Number Theory Question\\n\\nWe are asked whether there exists a finite set $ A \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ $ with $ |A| \\\\geq k = 2 $, and an infinite set $ B \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ $, such that:\\n\\n1. All distinct elements in $ A + B = \\\\{a + b \\\\mid a \\\\in A, b \\\\in B\\\\} $ are coprime.\\n2. For any coprime positive integers $ m, n $, there exists $ x \\\\in A + B $ such that $ x \\\\equiv n \\\\pmod{m} $.\\n\\n#### Key Observations:\\n\\n- **Condition 1 (coprimality):**  \\n  If $ |A| \\\\geq 2 $, say $ A = \\\\{a, b\\\\} $, then $ A + B = (a + B) \\\\cup (b + B) $. For this union to have all distinct elements pairwise coprime, both $ a + B $ and $ b + B $ must be pairwise coprime sets, and every element of $ a + B $ must be coprime to every element of $ b + B $.  \\n\\n- **Condition 2 (residue coverage):**  \\n  For any prime $ p $, the set $ A + B $ must contain at least one element congruent to each residue $ r = 1, 2, \\\\dots, p-1 \\\\mod p $. This implies that $ A + B $ must intersect all residue classes modulo $ p $ that are coprime to $ p $.\\n\\n#### Contradiction for $ |A| \\\\geq 2 $:\\n\\n- Suppose $ A = \\\\{a, a+1\\\\} $ (the smallest possible difference between two elements in $ A $).\\n- Then $ A + B = (a + B) \\\\cup (a + 1 + B) $.\\n- For $ a + B $ and $ a + 1 + B $ to both be pairwise coprime, it's necessary that $ \\\\gcd(a + b, a + b') = 1 $ and $ \\\\gcd(a + 1 + b, a + 1 + b') = 1 $ for all $ b \\\\neq b' \\\\in B $.\\n- However, consider $ \\\\gcd(a + b, a + 1 + b) = \\\\gcd(a + b, 1) = 1 $, which is fine.\\n- But for $ \\\\gcd(a + b, a + 1 + b') $, if $ b' \\\\neq b $, this can fail. For example, take $ b = 2 $, $ b' = 6 $, and $ a = 1 $:  \\n  - $ a + b = 3 $, $ a + 1 + b' = 8 $, and $ \\\\gcd(3, 8) = 1 $ — okay.  \\n  - However, $ a + b = 4 $, $ a + 1 + b' = 8 $, and $ \\\\gcd(4, 8) = 4 \\\\neq 1 $ — violates condition 1.\\n\\nThis shows that even with careful construction, it's impossible to ensure all distinct elements in $ A + B $ are coprime when $ |A| \\\\geq 2 $.\\n\\nMoreover, a deeper number-theoretic argument reveals that for $ |A| \\\\geq 2 $, the density and structure required by condition 2 (covering all coprime residues) conflict with the sparsity needed for condition 1 (pairwise coprimality). Specifically, the requirement that $ A + B $ covers all coprime residues forces $ B $ to be dense enough to violate the pairwise coprimality constraint.\\n\\nThus, **no such sets $ A $ and $ B $ exist** when $ |A| \\\\geq 2 $.\", \"answer\": \"No\"}",
