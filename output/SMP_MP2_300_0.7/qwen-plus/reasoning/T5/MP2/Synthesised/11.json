  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem consists of two parts. First, we need to find $\\\\alpha = P(1)$ for the extremal cubic polynomial $P(x)$ with a root in $[0,1]$, normalized to have maximum absolute value 1 on $[0,1]$, that maximizes $\\\\int_0^1 |P(x)| \\\\, dx$. Second, using this $\\\\alpha$, we determine all other real numbers $x$ satisfying $p(\\\\alpha / x) = x^2$ for a specific monic polynomial $p$ of degree $2n$.\\n\\n**Part 1: Finding $\\\\alpha = P(1)$**  \\n\\nThe extremal cubic polynomial that maximizes the $L^1$ norm under the $L^\\\\infty$ constraint (maximum absolute value 1) and having a root in $[0,1]$ is derived from the Chebyshev polynomial of degree 3, $T_3(x) = 4x^3 - 3x$, mapped to the interval $[0,1]$. Using the transformation $x = (t + 1)/2$ (where $t \\\\in [-1,1]$), we define:\\n$$\\nP(x) = T_3(2x - 1) = 4(2x - 1)^3 - 3(2x - 1).\\n$$\\nExpanding this gives:\\n$$\\nP(x) = 32x^3 - 48x^2 + 18x - 1.\\n$$\\nThis polynomial has roots at $x = \\\\frac{2 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ and $x = \\\\frac{1}{2}$, all within $[0,1]$, and achieves $|P(x)| = 1$ at $x = 0, \\\\frac{1}{4}, \\\\frac{3}{4}, 1$. Specifically:\\n- $P(0) = -1$,\\n- $P(\\\\frac{1}{4}) = 1$,\\n- $P(\\\\frac{1}{2}) = 0$,\\n- $P(\\\\frac{3}{4}) = -1$,\\n- $P(1) = 1$.\\n\\nSince $P(1) = 1$ and the polynomial is normalized to have maximum absolute value 1 on $[0,1]$, we conclude $\\\\alpha = P(1) = 1$.\\n\\n**Part 2: Finding other real $x$ such that $p(\\\\alpha / x) = x^2$**  \\n\\nGiven $\\\\alpha = 1$, the equation becomes $p(1/x) = x^2$. The polynomial $p(x)$ is monic of degree $2n$ and satisfies $p(1/k) = k^2$ for all integers $k$ with $1 \\\\leq |k| \\\\leq n$. Define $q(x) = x^2 p(x) - 1$, which is a polynomial of degree $2n + 2$. The condition $p(1/k) = k^2$ implies $q(1/k) = 0$ for $k = \\\\pm 1, \\\\ldots, \\\\pm n$, giving $2n$ roots. By symmetry and polynomial properties, $q(x)$ also has roots at $x = \\\\pm k$ for $k = 1, \\\\ldots, n$. Thus, the roots of $q(x) = 0$ are $x = \\\\pm 1/k$ and $x = \\\\pm k$ for $k = 1, \\\\ldots, n$.\\n\\nThe solutions to $p(1/x) = x^2$ correspond to $x = 1/y$ where $y$ is a root of $q(y) = 0$. This yields solutions $x = \\\\pm k$ and $x = \\\\pm 1/k$ for $k = 1, \\\\ldots, n$. The given conditions $p(1/k) = k^2$ correspond to $x = k$ (since $p(1/k) = k^2 \\\\implies p(1/x) = x^2$ when $x = k$). The \\\"other\\\" solutions are those not in $\\\\{ \\\\pm 1, \\\\ldots, \\\\pm n \\\\}$, which are $x = \\\\pm 1/k$ for $k = 1, \\\\ldots, n$.\\n\\nHowever, for $k = 1$, $x = \\\\pm 1$ are already included in the given solutions. For $k > 1$, $x = \\\\pm 1/k$ are distinct and not integers with $1 \\\\leq |x| \\\\leq n$. But the problem specifies $n$ is even and asks for all other real numbers $x$, independent of $n$. Through analysis of specific cases (e.g., $n = 2$), the only consistent solution across all even $n$ that satisfies the symmetry and polynomial structure is $x = \\\\pm 1$. This arises because the reciprocal symmetry of the polynomial roots and the normalization $\\\\alpha = 1$ lead to $x = \\\\pm 1$ as the universal other solutions when considering the extremal polynomial's properties.\", \"answer\": \"1\"}",
