  "math_problem": "Let $f$ be a monic cubic polynomial satisfying $f(x)+f(-x)=0$ for all real numbers $x$. For all real numbers $y$, define $g(y)$ to be the number of distinct real solutions $x$ to the equation $f(f(x))=y$. Suppose that the set of possible values of $g(y)$ over all real numbers $y$ is exactly $\\{1,5,9\\}$. Compute the sum of all possible values of $f(10)$. Instead of computing the sum of all possible values attained by the polynomial at the given argument, simply find $k$, the difference between such an attained value and 969, where the attained value is derived from the structural condition on the number of preimages under the function composition. Four points are chosen uniformly and independently at random in the interior of a given circle. Find the probability that they are the vertices of a convex quadrilateral, which equals $k - \\dfrac{35}{12\\pi^{2}}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves a monic cubic polynomial $ f $ that is odd, so $ f(x) = x^3 + ax $. The condition $ f(x) + f(-x) = 0 $ implies $ f $ has only odd powers, and being monic cubic, it must be $ f(x) = x^3 + ax $. \\n\\nTo satisfy the condition that the set of possible values of $ g(y) $ (number of distinct real solutions to $ f(f(x)) = y $) is exactly $ \\\\{1, 5, 9\\\\} $, we analyze the critical points of $ f $. The derivative $ f'(x) = 3x^2 + a $ has critical points at $ x = \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{-a/3} $ when $ a < 0 $. Let $ c = \\\\sqrt{-a/3} $, so $ a = -3c^2 $, and $ f(x) = x^3 - 3c^2x $.\\n\\nThe local maximum of $ f $ is $ 2c^3 $ at $ x = -c $, and the local minimum is $ -2c^3 $ at $ x = c $. For $ f(f(x)) = y $, the number of solutions depends on the number of real roots of $ f(z) = y $ (denoted $ N(y) $) and the number of real roots of $ f(x) = z $ (denoted $ M(z) $).\\n\\n- When $ |y| > 2c^3 $, $ N(y) = 1 $, and $ |z| > 2c^3 $, so $ M(z) = 1 $, giving $ g(y) = 1 $.\\n- When $ |y| = 2c^3 $, $ N(y) = 2 $, with $ z = -c $ (or $ c $) and $ z = 2c $ (or $ -2c $). For $ g(y) = 5 $, we need $ M(-c) + M(2c) = 5 $. This requires $ M(-c) = 3 $ (so $ c < 2c^3 $) and $ M(2c) = 2 $ (so $ 2c = 2c^3 $), leading to $ c = 1 $.\\n- When $ |y| < 2c^3 $, $ N(y) = 3 $, and all $ |z| < 2c^3 $, so $ M(z) = 3 $, giving $ g(y) = 9 $.\\n\\nThus, $ c = 1 $ is the only solution, so $ f(x) = x^3 - 3x $. Then $ f(10) = 10^3 - 3 \\\\cdot 10 = 970 $. The problem asks for $ k $, the difference between this value and 969, so $ k = 970 - 969 = 1 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
