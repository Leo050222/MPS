  "math_problem": "Find all functions $f:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, such that $$f(xy+f(x^2))=xf(x+y)$$ for all reals $x, y$. Instead of determining all functions from reals to reals that satisfy the given functional equation for all real inputs, simply find $c = f(1)$, where $f(1)$ is the value at input 1 for a solution $f$ to the equation derived from analysis of the equation's structure. Determine all positive integers $k$ such that $\\gcd(k, a_n)=c$ for all $n \\geq c$, where $a_n=2^n+3^n+6^n -c$, $n\\geq 1$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the functional equation $f(xy + f(x^2)) = x f(x + y)$ for all real $x, y$. Testing constant solutions, $f(x) = 0$ works, giving $c = f(1) = 0$. Testing linear solutions, $f(x) = x$ works, giving $c = 1$. However, $c = 0$ is invalid for the gcd condition since gcd must be a positive integer. Thus, $c = 1$ is the only valid value. Next, analyze $a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1$. For $\\\\gcd(k, a_n) = 1$ to hold for all $n \\\\geq 1$, $k$ must be coprime to all $a_n$. Since every prime divides some $a_n$ (e.g., 2 divides all $a_n$, 3 divides $a_2$, 5 divides $a_1$, etc.), the only $k$ satisfying the condition is $1$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
