Instead of finding all monic polynomials with integer coefficients such that there exists a positive integer $N$ where for every prime $p>N$ with $f(p)$ a positive integer, $p$ divides $2(f(p)!)+1$, simply find $d = k - 2$, where $k$ is the absolute value of the constant term in the unique linear monic polynomial with integer coefficients that satisfies the condition. Does there exist a function $f: \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R $  satisfying the following conditions: \n(i) for each real $y$  there is a real  $x$ such that $f(x)=y$ , and \n(ii)  $f(f(x)) = (x - d)f(x) + 2$ for all real $x$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, identify the unique linear monic polynomial with integer coefficients satisfying the condition. A linear monic polynomial is $ f(x) = x + c $. For primes $ p > N $, $ f(p) = p + c $ must be positive, so $ c $ is likely negative. Using Wilson's theorem, $ (p-1)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. Testing $ c = -3 $ (i.e., $ f(x) = x - 3 $), we find $ (p-3)! \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod p $ for $ p > 3 $, leading to $ 2(p-3)! + 1 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod p $, which satisfies the condition. The constant term is $ -3 $, so $ k = | -3 | = 3 $. Thus, $ d = k - 2 = 1 $. \\n\\nNext, check if a function $ f: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} $ exists with $ f(f(x)) = (x - 1)f(x) + 2 $ and surjectivity. Assume surjectivity: for $ y = -1 $, there exists $ b $ with $ f(b) = -1 $, leading to $ f(-1) = -b + 3 $. For $ y = 1 $, $ f(a) = 1 $ implies $ f(1) = a + 1 $. From $ x = 1 $, $ f(f(1)) = 2 $, and since $ f(0) = 2 $ (from $ f(b) = 0 $ implying $ f(0) = 2 $), $ f(1) = 0 $. This forces $ a = -1 $, so $ f(-1) = 1 $. Then $ b = 2 $, so $ f(2) = -1 $. However, $ f(2) = 0 $ from $ x = 0 $ (since $ f(f(0)) = f(2) = 0 $), creating a contradiction $ 0 = -1 $. Thus, no such function exists.\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\"\n}",
