Instead of finding all functions satisfying the functional equation, simply find $\\delta = c - 1$, where $c$ is the additive constant for which the linear function satisfies the equation. Let $\\mathbb{R}_\\delta^+ = (\\delta, \\infty)$ be the set of all real numbers greater than $\\delta$. Find all functions $f : \\mathbb{R}_\\delta^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}_\\delta^+$ and polynomials $P(x)$ with coefficients greater than or equal to $\\delta$ such that $P(\\delta) = \\delta$ which satisfy the equality $f(f(x) + P(y)) = f(x - y) + 2y$ for all real numbers $x > y > \\delta$.",

Substituting into the equation and equating coefficients of like terms leads to the following conditions:\\n\\n- Coefficient of $xy$: $a^2 = 1 \\\\Rightarrow a = 1$ or $a = -1$\\n- Coefficient of $y$: $a(a + b) = 2$\\n- Constant terms: $b(a + 2) = b(2a + 1)$\\n\\nFor $a = 1$, solving gives $b = 1$, and this satisfies all conditions. For $a = -1$, the constant term condition fails. Thus, the only valid linear solution is $f(x) = x + 1$, so $c = 1$.\\n\\nTherefore, $\\\\delta = c - 1 = 0$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
