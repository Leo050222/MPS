Line AG is x=0 (y-axis). Line CF connects C(1,1) and F(1/3,4/3), with slope -1/2, equation y = -1/2 x + 3/2. Intersection X with AG (x=0) is (0, 3/2). AX = 3/2. Compute k = AX + 29/2 = 3/2 + 29/2 = 32/2 = 16.\\n\\nProblem 2: The condition requires S to be closed under x ↦ 2x mod 16. The functional graph has a cycle at 0 and trees feeding into it. Using poset upper set counting: for each node, u(y) = product over children (1 + u(child)). Leaves (1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15) have u=1. Nodes 2,10,6,14 (each with two leaves) have u=4. Nodes 4,12 (each with two nodes) have u=25. Node 8 (with 4 and 12) has u=676. Node 0 has u=677. Total upper sets = 677 + 1 = 678.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"16\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"678\"\n}",
