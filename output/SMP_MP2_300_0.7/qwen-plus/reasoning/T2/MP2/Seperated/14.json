Assuming every twelve donuts cost \\$7.49, what is the minimum amount Victoria needs to pay, in dollars? Instead of computing the minimum cost to acquire at least the required number of units when purchases are constrained to multiples of the base quantity, simply find $e = \\left\\lfloor 550 / 12 \\right\\rfloor - 43$."

Testing values, $ n = 24 $ gives $ \\\\left\\\\lfloor 24^2 / 5 \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 115 = 5 \\\\times 23 $, so $ p = 23 $. $ n = 27 $ gives $ \\\\left\\\\lfloor 27^2 / 5 \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 145 = 5 \\\\times 29 $, so $ p = 29 $.
