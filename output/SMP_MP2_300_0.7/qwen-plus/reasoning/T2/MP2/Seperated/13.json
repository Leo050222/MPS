Assume that all animals are distinguishable from each other. Instead of determining the total number of ways to pair up all the animals into mixed-species pairs, simply find $k = x + 2$, where $x$ is the number of cow-pig pairs in any such complete pairing."

Let $ x $ = cow-pig pairs, $ y $ = cow-horse, $ z $ = pig-horse. Total pairs: $ x + y + z = 8 $. Cows used: $ x + y = 5 $, pigs: $ x + z = 4 $, horses: $ y + z = 7 $. Solving gives $ x = 1 $. Thus, $ k = x + 2 = 3 $. Problem 2: Count valid 3-cell colorings in a $ 3 \\\\times 3 $ grid with no shared edges. Using combinatorial analysis and inclusion-exclusion, valid configurations total 22. This includes cases like three corners, center with two corners, edge centers with corners, etc., verified by systematic counting and correcting inclusion-exclusion errors.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"22\"\n}",
