The probability that there exists a time during this process where there are more blue balls than red balls in the jar can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime integers $a$ and $b$. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing 100 times the numerator plus the denominator of the probability expressed in lowest terms, simply find $n$ equal to the greatest common divisor of that numerator and denominator plus 2004."

Total sequences: C(10,2)=45. Bad sequences (where blue > red at some point) are those where either the first 7 removals are red (3 sequences) or one blue is in positions 1-7 and the other in 10 (7 sequences), totaling 10. Probability=10/45=2/9. gcd(2,9)=1, so n=1+2004=2005.\\n\\nProblem 2: Each subdivision of an L-shape produces 4 smaller L-shapes. By symmetry, each L-shape (regardless of orientation) contributes exactly one L-shape in the original orientation when subdivided. After n subdivisions, the count of original-orientation L-shapes is 4^{n-1}. For n=2005, this is 4^{2004}.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2005\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4^2004\"\n}",
