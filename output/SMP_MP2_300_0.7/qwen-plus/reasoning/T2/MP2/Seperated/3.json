(Rotations and reflections are considered different.) Instead of counting the total number of valid placements satisfying the row, column, and corner avoidance conditions, simply find $s = m - 4$, where $m$ is the number of columns available for the intermediate rows after assigning columns to the boundary rows under the given constraints."

In a move, Sally can move to a point in the lattice exactly one unit away. Given that Sally starts at $(2,1)$, compute the number of possible paths Sally can take."

Boundary rows cannot use corner columns (1 and 8), so they choose from columns 2-7 (6 columns). After selecting 2 distinct columns for rows 1 and 8, 8 - 2 = 6 columns remain available for the 6 intermediate rows. Thus, m = 6, so s = 6 - 4 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a 3×24 grid, the number of Hamiltonian paths starting at (2,1) follows a pattern where each additional column doubles the number of paths. For n=1, there are 2 paths; for n=2, 4 paths; hence, the pattern is 2^n. For n=24, the number of paths is 2^24 = 16777216.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"16777216\"\n}",
