Somehow, they have managed to arrange these sticks, such that they form the sides of an equiangular hexagon. Compute the sum of all possible values of the area of this hexagon. Instead of computing the sum of all possible values of the area of this hexagon, simply find $e = (d + 208)$, where $d$ is the smaller possible value of the length of the fourth side in an arrangement starting with the shortest stick as the first side."

With s1 = 1 (shortest stick), solving these equations shows valid fourth side lengths (s4) are 2 and 4. The smaller value d = 2, so e = 2 + 208 = 210.\\n\\nProblem 2: The largest 2013-digit base -4 number has digits 3 at even positions and 0 at odd positions. This forms N = (16^1007 - 1)/5. Using modular arithmetic and Chinese Remainder Theorem, N mod 210 = 51.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"210\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"51\"\n}",
