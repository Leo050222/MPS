Given $AX = 6$, $XY = 4$, and $YE = 7$, we need to find $k = CE - 8$.  \\n\\nLet $L = AC = BD = CE$. Using the intersecting chords theorem:\\n- At $X$: $AX \\\\cdot XC = BX \\\\cdot XD$  \\n  $6(L - 6) = BX(4 + YD)$\\n- At $Y$: $BY \\\\cdot YD = CY \\\\cdot YE$  \\n  $(BX + 4)YD = (L - 7) \\\\cdot 7$\\n\\nLet $BX = m$, $YD = n$. Then $BD = m + 4 + n = L$, so $m + n = L - 4$. Substituting into the equations:\\n- $6(L - 6) = m(4 + n)$\\n- $7(L - 7) = (m + 4)n$\\n\\nSolving these, we derive two cases from factoring:\\n1. $m = 3$, $n = 2$ → $L = 9$\\n2. $m = 6$, $n = 7$ → $L = 17$\\n\\nFor $L = 9$, the configuration leads to degenerate angles (e.g., $\\\\cos\\\\theta = -1$), violating convexity. For $L = 17$, all conditions hold with valid convex geometry. Thus, $CE = 17$, so $k = 17 - 8 = 9$.\\n\\nProblem 2: A unit square $ABCD$ has $A(0,0)$, $B(1,0)$, $C(1,1)$, $D(0,1)$. A circle with radius $\\\\frac{32}{49}$ is tangent to $AB$ at $E(h, 0)$, so its center is $(h, \\\\frac{32}{49})$. Since it passes through $D(0,1)$:\\n$$\\n\\\\sqrt{h^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{32}{49} - 1\\\\right)^2} = \\\\frac{32}{49}\\n$$\\nSolving:\\n$$\\nh^2 + \\\\left(-\\\\frac{17}{49}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\left(\\\\frac{32}{49}\\\\right)^2 \\\\implies h^2 = \\\\frac{32^2 - 17^2}{49^2} = \\\\frac{735}{2401} = \\\\frac{15}{49}\\n$$\\nThus, $h = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{15}}{7}$. The distance $DE$ is:\\n$$\\nDE = \\\\sqrt{h^2 + 1^2} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{15}{49} + 1} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{64}{49}} = \\\\frac{8}{7}\\n$$\\nSo $m = 8$, $n = 7$, giving $100m + n = 807$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"807\"\n}",
