Instead of determining the probability of obtaining exactly two distinct colors in the sample, simply find $k = \\binom{5}{2} + 80$, where $\\binom{5}{2}$ is the number of ways to choose the two distinct colors from the five available."

Calculating $ \\\\binom{5}{2} = 10 $, so $ k = 10 + 80 = 90 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Triangle $ \\\\triangle ABC $ has sides $ AB = 21 $, $ BC = 55 $, and $ CA = 56 $. Points $ P $ lie on the angle bisector of $ \\\\angle BAC $ and satisfy $ \\\\angle BPC = 90^\\\\circ $, meaning $ P $ lies on the circle with diameter $ BC $. The distance between the two intersection points of the angle bisector with this circle is the chord length. Using the chord length formula $ 2\\\\sqrt{r^2 - d^2} $, where $ r = 55/2 $ (radius) and $ d = 25\\\\sqrt{3}/4 $ (distance from circle center to angle bisector), we find $ r^2 - d^2 = 10225/16 $. Thus, the chord length is $ 2 \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{10225/16} = \\\\frac{5\\\\sqrt{409}}{2} $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"90\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"5*sqrt(409)/2\"\n}",
