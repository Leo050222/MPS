      "A1433": "During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^{2}$. Instead of determining the real part of the square of the starting point, simply find $k = |z| - 1$, where $|z|$ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days."

The ID number satisfies the following property: the first two digits is a number divisible by 2, the first three digits is a number divisible by 3, etc. so that the ID number itself is divisible by 6. One ID number that satisfies this condition is 123252. How many different possibilities are there for Bob's ID number?"

For Saturday, the path length is |z² - 1| * r * C, and for Sunday, it is |z² - 1| * C, where C is a geometric series sum and r = |z|. Setting both equal implies r = 1, so k = |z| - 1 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: The ID must satisfy divisibility conditions. d5 is fixed as 5. d2 must be even (4 choices). For each d1 (9 choices) and d2, d3 has 3 choices to satisfy divisibility by 3. For each d3, d4 has 2 choices to satisfy divisibility by 4. For each d4, d6 has a number of choices (depending on d4's residue mod 3) such that the total sum is divisible by 3 and d6 is even. Analysis shows that for each d3, there are exactly 3 valid (d4, d6) pairs. Total count: 9 * 4 * 3 * 3 = 324.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"324\"\n}",
