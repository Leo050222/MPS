Then $ e = s + 17 = 24 + 17 = 41 $. Problem 2: The polynomial $ x^2 + x + 41 $ generates primes for $ x = 0 $ to $ x = 39 $. For $ x = 40 $, the value is $ 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 1681 = 41^2 $, which is composite. Checking all smaller positive integers confirms $ x = 40 $ is the smallest such value.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"41\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"40\"\n}",
