To maximize the smallest sector, consider the configuration where two diameters form angles such that splitting one sector creates symmetry. The optimal setup has three sectors of angle $\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{3}$ and two sectors of $\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{3}$, making the smallest sector $\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\pi$. The denominator $b = 3$, so $k = b + 4 = 7$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Check numbers greater than 10 for equal digit sums in base 10 and base 17. For $N = 153$, base 10 digits sum to $1+5+3=9$, and base 17 representation is $9 \\\\times 17 + 0$, with digit sum $9+0=9$.
