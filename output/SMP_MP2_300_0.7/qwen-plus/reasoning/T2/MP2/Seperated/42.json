Testing values, 2(4)² + 3² = 32 + 9 = 41. Here, r = 4 and s = 3 are coprime (gcd(4, 3) = 1). Thus, k = gcd(r, s) + 0 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The sum ∑_{i=1}^∞ (i+1)(i+2)(i+3)/(-2)^i is evaluated using generating functions. The generating function for ∑_{i=0}^∞ (i+1)(i+2)(i+3)x^i = 6/(1 - x)^4. Subtracting the i=0 term (6) gives the sum from i=1. Substituting x = -1/2: 6/(1 - (-1/2))^4 - 6 = 6/(3/2)^4 - 6 = 32/27 - 6 = -130/27.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-130/27\"\n}",
