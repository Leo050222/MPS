In each pair, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is knocked out of the tournament. The probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other during the tournament is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of evaluating the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator representing the probability that the two designated players meet during the tournament, simply find $e = b - 16$, where $b$ is the denominator of that probability when expressed as a reduced fraction."

For round k (1 ≤ k ≤ 5), the probability they meet in round k is 1/(31·2^(k-1)). Summing these gives 1/31 + 1/62 + 1/124 + 1/248 + 1/496 = 31/496 = 1/16. The reduced fraction has denominator b = 16, so e = b - 16 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: For small x > 0, expand (1+x)^10 ≈ 1 + 10x. The expression becomes x^p · [(-10x)/(2)] = -5x^{p+1}. To have this approach a constant integer c as x→0, set p+1 = 0 ⇒ p = -1. The limit is -5, so c = -5. The inequality holds for c = -5 and p = -1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(-1, -5)\"\n}",
