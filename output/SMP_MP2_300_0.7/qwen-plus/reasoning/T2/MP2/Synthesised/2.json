  "math_problem": "Let $m, n > 2$ be integers. One of the angles of a regular $n$-gon is dissected into $m$ angles of equal size by $(m-1)$ rays. If each of these rays intersects the polygon again at one of its vertices, we say $n$ is $m$-cut. Compute the smallest positive integer $n$ that is both 3-cut and 4-cut. Instead of computing the smallest positive integer $n$ that is both 3-cut and 4-cut, simply find $k = t - \\frac{23}{2}$, where $t$ is the least common multiple of 3 and 4, where this is the smallest positive integer divisible by both values of $m$ in the required cut conditions. Alice and Bob play a game on a circle with $(k \\times 16)$ marked points. Alice places an apple beneath one of the points, then picks $(k \\times 10)$ of the other $(k \\times 14)$ points and reveals that none of them are hiding the apple. Bob then drops a bomb on any of the points, and destroys the apple if he drops the bomb either on the point containing the apple or on an adjacent point. Bob wins if he destroys the apple, and Alice wins if he fails. If both players play optimally, what is the probability that Bob destroys the apple?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute k = t - 23/2 where t is LCM(3,4). LCM(3,4)=12, so k=12 - 11.5=0.5. The circle has k×16=8 points. Alice places the apple under one point and reveals k×10=5 points (from the remaining 7), leaving 3 candidate points. Bob wins if he bombs the apple or an adjacent point (covers 3 consecutive points). By the pigeonhole principle, any 3 points on an 8-point circle must have at least 2 in some 3-consecutive arc. Alice optimally chooses the 3 candidates to minimize Bob's coverage (max 2 points), and Bob optimally bombs to cover 2. Thus, the probability is 2/3.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2/3\"\n}",
