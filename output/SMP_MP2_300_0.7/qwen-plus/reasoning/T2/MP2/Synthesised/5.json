  "math_problem": "A committee of 5 is to be chosen from a group of 9 people. How many ways can it be chosen, if Bill and Karl must serve together or not at all, and Alice and Jane refuse to serve with each other? Instead of determining the total number of valid committee selections, simply find $k$, the number of valid committees when the must-serve-together pair is excluded and the refusing-to-serve-together pair is both included. An ant starts out at $(k, k)$. Each second, if it is currently at the square $(x, y)$, it can move to $(x-1, y-1),(x-1, y+1),(x+1, y-1)$, or $(x+1, y+1)$. In how many ways can it end up at $(2010,2010)$ after 4020 seconds?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ k $, the number of valid committees where Bill and Karl are excluded (so neither serves) and Alice and Jane are both included. However, Alice and Jane refuse to serve together, making any committee with both invalid. Thus, $ k = 0 $. The ant starts at $ (0, 0) $. Each move changes $ x $ and $ y $ by $ \\\\pm 1 $, so to reach $ (2010, 2010) $ in 4020 moves, the total displacement in $ x $ and $ y $ must each be 2010. This requires 3015 right moves (and 1005 left) for $ x $, and similarly 3015 up moves (and 1005 down) for $ y $. The number of ways to choose right moves is $ \\\\binom{4020}{3015} $, and the same for up moves. Since these choices are independent, the total number of paths is $ \\\\left( \\\\binom{4020}{3015} \\\\right)^2 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"C(4020, 3015)^2\"\n}",
