  "math_problem": "Suppose $a$ and $b$ be positive integers not exceeding 100 such that $$a b=\\left(\\frac{\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)}{\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)}\\right)^{2}$$ Compute the largest possible value of $a+b$. Instead of computing the maximum possible sum of two positive integers not exceeding 100 that satisfy the given equation relating their product to the square of the ratio of their least common multiple to their greatest common divisor, simply find $m = s - 77$, where $s$ is that maximum possible sum. Consider a $5 \\times 5$ grid of squares. Vladimir colors some of these squares red, such that for any two distinct rows, the number of columns in which both have a red square is at most $m$. What is the maximum number of squares he could have colored red?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we proceed in two distinct parts:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Part 1: Finding the Maximum Value of $ a + b $**\\n\\nWe are given that $ a $ and $ b $ are positive integers not exceeding 100 such that:\\n$$\\nab = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)}{\\\\gcd(a, b)} \\\\right)^2\\n$$\\n\\nLet $ d = \\\\gcd(a, b) $. Then we can write $ a = d \\\\cdot x $, $ b = d \\\\cdot y $, where $ \\\\gcd(x, y) = 1 $. Using the identity $ \\\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = \\\\frac{ab}{d} $, the equation becomes:\\n$$\\nab = \\\\left( \\\\frac{ab}{d^2} \\\\right)^2 \\\\Rightarrow ab = \\\\frac{a^2 b^2}{d^4} \\\\Rightarrow d^4 = ab\\n$$\\n\\nThis implies that $ ab $ must be a perfect fourth power. Since $ a = d x $, $ b = d y $, and $ \\\\gcd(x, y) = 1 $, then $ x y = d^2 $. Because $ x $ and $ y $ are coprime, both must be perfect squares. Let $ x = s^2 $, $ y = t^2 $, so $ d = st $, and thus:\\n$$\\na = s^3 t, \\\\quad b = s t^3\\n$$\\n\\nWe now seek to maximize $ a + b = s t (s^2 + t^2) $ under the constraints $ a \\\\leq 100 $, $ b \\\\leq 100 $, and $ \\\\gcd(s, t) = 1 $.\\n\\nTesting all valid combinations of $ s $ and $ t $ with $ \\\\gcd(s, t) = 1 $, we find that the maximum occurs when $ s = 2 $, $ t = 3 $:\\n- $ a = 2^3 \\\\cdot 3 = 24 $\\n- $ b = 2 \\\\cdot 3^3 = 54 $\\n- $ a + b = 78 $\\n\\nAll other combinations either exceed the limit of 100 or yield smaller sums.\\n\\nThus, the largest possible value of $ a + b $ is $ s = 78 $.\\n\\nNow compute $ m = s - 77 = 78 - 77 = 1 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Part 2: Maximum Number of Red Squares in a 5×5 Grid**\\n\\nVladimir colors some squares red in a $ 5 \\\\times 5 $ grid such that for any two distinct rows, the number of columns in which both have a red square is at most $ m = 1 $.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum number of 1s in a binary matrix of size $ 5 \\\\times 5 $ where the dot product of any two distinct rows is at most 1.\\n\\nLet $ w_i $ be the number of red squares in row $ i $, and let $ W = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{5} w_i $ be the total number of red squares.\\n\\nThe sum of pairwise dot products over all distinct row pairs is:\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{1 \\\\leq i < j \\\\leq 5} (\\\\text{row}_i \\\\cdot \\\\text{row}_j) \\\\leq \\\\binom{5}{2} \\\\cdot 1 = 10\\n$$\\n\\nOn the other hand, this sum also equals:\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{j=1}^{5} \\\\binom{c_j}{2}\\n$$\\nwhere $ c_j $ is the number of red squares in column $ j $, and $ \\\\sum c_j = W $.\\n\\nUsing the inequality $ \\\\sum \\\\binom{c_j}{2} \\\\geq \\\\frac{W^2}{5} - \\\\frac{W}{2} $, we derive:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{W^2}{5} - \\\\frac{W}{2} \\\\leq 10 \\\\Rightarrow W^2 - 5W - 100 \\\\leq 0\\n$$\\nSolving gives $ W \\\\leq \\\\frac{5 + \\\\sqrt{425}}{2} \\\\approx 12.8 $, so $ W \\\\leq 12 $.\\n\\nA construction achieving $ W = 12 $ is:\\n- Row 1: [1, 2, 3]\\n- Row 2: [1, 4, 5]\\n- Row 3: [2, 4]\\n- Row 4: [3, 5]\\n- Row 5: [2, 5]\\n\\nEach pair of rows intersects in at most one column, satisfying the condition. No configuration with more than 12 red squares satisfies the constraint.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Final Answer**\", \"answer\": \"12\"}",
