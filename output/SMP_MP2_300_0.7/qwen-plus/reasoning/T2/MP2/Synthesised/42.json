We need to express $41$ as $2r^2 + s^2$ with coprime positive integers $r, s$. Testing values, $2(4)^2 + 3^2 = 32 + 9 = 41$, so $r = 4$, $s = 3$. Since $\\\\gcd(4, 3) = 1$, $k = \\\\gcd(r, s) + 0 = 1$.\\n\\nNext, evaluate the infinite sum $\\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{(i+k)(i+2)(i+3)}{(-2)^i}$ with $k = 1$. This becomes $\\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{(i+1)(i+2)(i+3)}{(-2)^i}$.\\n\\nUsing generating functions, recall that $\\\\sum_{i=0}^{\\\\infty} (i+1)(i+2)(i+3)x^i = \\\\frac{6}{(1 - x)^4}$ for $|x| < 1$.
