  "math_problem": "Eight points are chosen on the circumference of a circle, labelled $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{8}$ in clockwise order. A route is a sequence of at least two points $P_{a_{1}}, P_{a_{2}}, \\ldots, P_{a_{n}}$ such that if an ant were to visit these points in their given order, starting at $P_{a_{1}}$ and ending at $P_{a_{n}}$, by following $n-1$ straight line segments (each connecting each $P_{a_{i}}$ and $P_{a_{i+1}}$ ), it would never visit a point twice or cross its own path. Find the number of routes. Instead of determining the total number of such routes, simply find $k = r - 1092$, where $r$ is the number of valid routes starting from the designated point $P_8$. Let $A B C D E F G H$ be an equilateral octagon with $\\angle A \\cong \\angle C \\cong \\angle E \\cong \\angle G$ and $\\angle B \\cong \\angle D \\cong \\angle F \\cong \\angle H$. If the area of $A B C D E F G H$ is three times the area of $A C E G$, then $\\sin B$ can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\gcd(m, n)=k$. Find $100 m+n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine the number of valid routes starting from $ P_8 $ on a circle with 8 points. A route is defined as a sequence of at least two points where the path does not cross itself or revisit any point. For a convex polygon with $ n $ points, the number of such non-crossing paths starting at a fixed vertex is given by the formula:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{3^{n-1} - 1}{2}\\n$$\\n\\nFor $ n = 8 $, this becomes:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{3^7 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{2187 - 1}{2} = 1093\\n$$\\n\\nLet $ r = 1093 $. Then $ k = r - 1092 = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, consider the equilateral octagon $ ABCDEFGH $ with alternating angles $ \\\\angle A \\\\cong \\\\angle C \\\\cong \\\\angle E \\\\cong \\\\angle G = \\\\alpha $ and $ \\\\angle B \\\\cong \\\\angle D \\\\cong \\\\angle F \\\\cong \\\\angle H = \\\\beta $.
