  "math_problem": "$A B C D E$ is a cyclic convex pentagon, and $A C=B D=C E . A C$ and $B D$ intersect at $X$, and $B D$ and $C E$ intersect at $Y$. If $A X=6, X Y=4$, and $Y E=7$, then the area of pentagon $A B C D E$ can be written as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are integers, $c$ is positive, $b$ is square-free, and $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$. Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of determining the encoded numerical representation of the pentagon's area in radical form, simply find $k = CE - 8$, where $CE$ is the common length of the specified equal chords derived from the given segment lengths along the intersecting lines. Let $A B C D$ be a unit square. A circle with radius $\\frac{32}{49}$ passes through point $D$ and is tangent to side $A B$ at point $E$. Then $D E=\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=k$. Find $100 m+n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding $ k = CE - 8 $ where $ CE $ is derived from the cyclic pentagon's geometry. Using the intersecting chords theorem and cyclic quadrilateral similarity conditions:\\n\\n- For chords $ AC $ and $ BD $ intersecting at $ X $: $ AX \\\\cdot CX = BX \\\\cdot XD $. Given $ AX = 6 $, let $ CX = m $, so $ AC = 6 + m $.\\n- For chords $ BD $ and $ CE $ intersecting at $ Y $: $ BY \\\\cdot YD = CY \\\\cdot YE $. Given $ YE = 7 $, $ CE = CY + 7 = AC = 6 + m $, so $ CY = m - 1 $.\\n- The quadratic equation from intersecting chords at $ X $ factors as $ (BX - 6)(BX - m) = 0 $, giving $ BX = 6 $ or $ BX = m $.\\n- Assuming order $ B-Y-X-D $ on $ BD $, $ XY = 4 $ implies $ BY = BX - 4 $. Substituting into the second intersecting chords equation yields $ 2(4 + m) = 7(m - 1) $, solving to $ m = 3 $.\\n- Thus, $ CE = 6 + 3 = 9 $, so $ k = 9 - 8 = 1 $.\\n\\nFor the unit square $ ABCD $ with $ A(0,0), B(1,0), C(1,1), D(0,1) $:\\n- A circle tangent to $ AB $ at $ E(h,0) $ has center $ (h, 32/49) $. Passing through $ D(0,1) $ gives $ h^2 + (1 - 32/49)^2 = (32/49)^2 $, so $ h^2 = 15/49 $.\\n- Distance $ DE = \\\\sqrt{h^2 + 1} = \\\\sqrt{64/49} = 8/7 $. Thus, $ m = 8, n = 7 $, $ \\\\gcd(8,7) = 1 = k $.\\n- Final result: $ 100m + n = 807 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"807\"\n}",
