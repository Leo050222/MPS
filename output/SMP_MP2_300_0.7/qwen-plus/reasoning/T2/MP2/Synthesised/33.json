Line $C F$ meets line $A G$ at $X$. The length $A X$ can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing the hundredfold numerator plus the denominator of the intersection length in reduced terms, simply find $k = AX + \\frac{29}{2}$, where $AX$ is the distance from $A$ to the intersection point $X$. Compute the number of sets $S$ such that every element of $S$ is a nonnegative integer less than $k$, and if $x \\in S$ then $(2 x \\bmod k) \\in S$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, set up coordinates for the squares. Square $ABCD$ has vertices $A(0,0)$, $B(1,0)$, $C(1,1)$, $D(0,1)$. Square $DEFG$ has side length $\\\\frac{1}{3}$, with $E$ on $\\\\overline{CD}$ (so $E(\\\\frac{1}{3},1)$), $F(\\\\frac{1}{3}, \\\\frac{4}{3})$, and $G(0, \\\\frac{4}{3})$ (since $A, D, G$ lie on the line $x=0$ in order). Line $AG$ is the vertical line $x=0$. Line $CF$ connects $C(1,1)$ and $F(\\\\frac{1}{3}, \\\\frac{4}{3})$; its equation is $y = -\\\\frac{1}{2}x + \\\\frac{3}{2}$. The intersection $X$ of $CF$ and $AG$ is at $(0, \\\\frac{3}{2})$, so $AX = \\\\frac{3}{2}$. Then $k = AX + \\\\frac{29}{2} = \\\\frac{3}{2} + \\\\frac{29}{2} = 16$.\\n\\nNext, find the number of sets $S$ where elements are nonnegative integers less than $16$ and if $x \\\\in S$, then $(2x \\\\mod 16) \\\\in S$. The operation $f(x) = 2x \\\\mod 16$ forms a tree rooted at $0$, with all paths leading to $0$. Closed sets under $f$ are either empty or contain $0$ and a downward-closed subset of the non-zero elements. Using recursive counting:\\n- Leaves (level 4: 8 nodes) have 2 choices each.\\n- Level 3 nodes (4 nodes) each have $1 + 2 \\\\times 2 = 5$ choices.\\n- Level 2 nodes (2 nodes) each have $1 + 5 \\\\times 5 = 26$ choices.\\n- Level 1 node (8) has $1 + 26 \\\\times 26 = 677$ choices.\\nTotal closed sets: $1$ (empty set) + $677$ (sets containing $0$) = $678$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"678\"\n}",
