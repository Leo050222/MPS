  "math_problem": "In $\\triangle A B C$, the incircle centered at $I$ touches sides $A B$ and $B C$ at $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Additionally, the area of quadrilateral $B X I Y$ is $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the area of $A B C$. Let $p$ be the smallest possible perimeter of a $\\triangle A B C$ that meets these conditions and has integer side lengths. Find the smallest possible area of such a triangle with perimeter $p$. Instead of determining the smallest possible area of a triangle satisfying the incircle and area conditions with the minimal integer-sided perimeter, simply find $s$, where $s$ is the semiperimeter of a triangle achieving that minimal perimeter. For a positive integer $n$, let $p(n)$ denote the product of the positive integer factors of $n$. Determine the number of factors $n$ of $(s + 2305)$ for which $p(n)$ is a perfect square.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"In $\\\\triangle ABC$, the incircle touches $AB$ at $X$ and $BC$ at $Y$. The area of quadrilateral $BXIY$ is $\\\\frac{2}{5}$ of the area of $\\\\triangle ABC$. Using properties of the incircle and tangent lengths, we find that $(s - b)^2 = \\\\frac{ac}{5}$, where $s$ is the semiperimeter, and $a, b, c$ are the side lengths. For integer sides, the smallest perimeter occurs with sides $4, 5, 5$, giving semiperimeter $s = 7$. \\n\\nNext, $s + 2305 = 2312 = 2^3 \\\\cdot 17^2$. We need to count divisors $n$ of $2312$ where the product of $n$'s positive divisors is a perfect square. The product of divisors of $n$ is $n^{d(n)/2}$, which is a perfect square iff $n^{d(n)}$ is a fourth power. This requires $v_p(n) \\\\cdot d(n) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod 4$ for all primes $p$ dividing $n$.\\n\\nChecking all 12 divisors of $2312$, the valid ones are $1, 8, 34, 136, 2312$, totaling 5.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
