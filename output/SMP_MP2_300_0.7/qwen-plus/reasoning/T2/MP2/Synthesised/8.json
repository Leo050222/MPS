  "math_problem": "Teresa the bunny has a fair 8-sided die. Seven of its sides have fixed labels $1,2, \\\\ldots, 7$, and the label on the eighth side can be changed and begins as 1. She rolls it several times, until each of $1,2, \\\\ldots, 7$ appears at least once. After each roll, if $k$ is the smallest positive integer that she has not rolled so far, she relabels the eighth side with $k$. The probability that 7 is the last number she rolls is $\\\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the specified linear combination from the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process, simply find $m = q_0 + 3999/4$, where $q_0$ is the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process derived from the recursive probability analysis of the states based on the number of distinct fixed labels collected. Let $N$ be the number of triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ satisfying $a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c, \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b, c)=1, \\\\quad a b c=6^{2020}$. Compute the remainder when $N$ is divided by $m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main parts: determining the value of $ m $ and computing $ N \\\\mod m $, where $ N $ is the number of triples $(a, b, c)$ satisfying specific conditions.\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine $ m $\\n\\nThe problem states that $ m = q_0 + \\\\frac{3999}{4} $, where $ q_0 $ is the probability that the highest fixed label (7) is the last new label obtained in the rolling process. This is a variant of the coupon collector problem with a twist: the eighth side of the die is relabeled to the smallest missing number after each roll.\\n\\nThrough recursive analysis and recognizing a pattern in smaller cases (e.g., for $ n = 2, 3 $), it's found that the probability $ q_n $ that the $ n $-th label is the last to be collected is $ \\\\frac{2}{n+1} $. For $ n = 7 $, this gives:\\n$$\\nq_0 = \\\\frac{2}{7+1} = \\\\frac{1}{4}\\n$$\\nThus,\\n$$\\nm = \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{3999}{4} = \\\\frac{4000}{4} = 1000\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 2: Compute $ N $, the number of valid triples\\n\\nWe are to count the number of triples $(a, b, c)$ such that:\\n- $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c $\\n- $ \\\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1 $\\n- $ abc = 6^{2020} $\\n\\nSince $ 6^{2020} = 2^{2020} \\\\cdot 3^{2020} $, we consider the exponents of 2 and 3 separately. The condition $ \\\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1 $ implies that not all three numbers are divisible by 2 **and** not all are divisible by 3.\\n\\nUsing inclusion-exclusion and properties of divisor functions, the total number of ordered triples with $ abc = 6^{2020} $ and $ \\\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1 $ is:\\n$$\\nT_1 = (3 \\\\cdot 2020)^2 = 9 \\\\cdot 2020^2\\n$$\\n\\nThe number of unordered triples with $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c $ is derived as:\\n$$\\nN = \\\\frac{T_1 + 3E}{6}\\n$$\\nwhere $ E = 4 $ (the number of unordered pairs with two equal elements and $ \\\\gcd = 1 $). Substituting values:\\n$$\\nN = \\\\frac{9 \\\\cdot 2020^2 + 12}{6} = 6 \\\\cdot 1010^2 + 2\\n$$\\n\\nCompute:\\n$$\\n1010^2 = 1020100 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad 6 \\\\cdot 1020100 = 6120600 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad N = 6120602\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 3: Compute $ N \\\\mod m $\\n\\nWith $ m = 1000 $, we find:\\n$$\\n6120602 \\\\mod 1000 = 602\\n$$\",\n    \"answer\": \"602\"\n}",
