  "math_problem": "The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to $k>0$, find $k$. Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition. A ladder is leaning against a house with its lower end $d$ feet from the house. When the lower end is pulled 9 feet farther from the house, the upper end slides 13 feet down. How long is the ladder (in feet)?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, let the width of the rectangle be $ w $. The length is $ 3w $. The perimeter is $ 2(w + 3w) = 8w $ and the area is $ w \\\\cdot 3w = 3w^2 $. Setting them equal gives $ 8w = 3w^2 $, so $ w(3w - 8) = 0 $. Since $ w > 0 $, $ w = \\\\frac{8}{3} $. Then $ d = w + \\\\frac{37}{3} = \\\\frac{8}{3} + \\\\frac{37}{3} = \\\\frac{45}{3} = 15 $. For the ladder problem, initially the base is $ d = 15 $ feet from the house. Let the ladder length be $ L $ and initial height be $ h $. Then $ L^2 = 15^2 + h^2 $. After moving, the base is $ 15 + 9 = 24 $ feet and height is $ h - 13 $, so $ L^2 = 24^2 + (h - 13)^2 $. Equating both expressions: $ 225 + h^2 = 576 + h^2 - 26h + 169 $. Simplifying gives $ 225 = 745 - 26h $, so $ 26h = 520 $ and $ h = 20 $. Thus $ L^2 = 15^2 + 20^2 = 625 $, so $ L = 25 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"25\"\n}",
