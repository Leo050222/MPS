  "math_problem": "A jar contains 8 red balls and 2 blue balls. Every minute, a ball is randomly removed. The probability that there exists a time during this process where there are more blue balls than red balls in the jar can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime integers $a$ and $b$. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing 100 times the numerator plus the denominator of the probability expressed in lowest terms, simply find $n$ equal to the greatest common divisor of that numerator and denominator plus 2004. The L shape made by adjoining three congruent squares can be subdivided into four smaller L shapes. Each of these can in turn be subdivided, and so forth. If we perform $n$ successive subdivisions, how many of the $4^{n}$ L's left at the end will be in the same orientation as the original one?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main parts. First, calculating the probability that at some point during the removal of balls from a jar (8 red, 2 blue), there are more blue balls than red balls. Using combinatorial analysis and the reflection principle, the number of favorable sequences where blue exceeds red at some point is 10 out of 45 total sequences, simplifying to 2/9. Since 2 and 9 are coprime, gcd(2,9)=1, so n = 1 + 2004 = 2005.\\n\\nNext, for the L-shape subdivision: each subdivision of an L-shape into four smaller L-shapes results in one L in each of four orientations. After n subdivisions, the number of L-shapes in the original orientation is 4^{n-1}. For n=2005, this is 4^{2004}.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4^2004\"\n}",
