  "math_problem": "Farmer John has 5 cows, 4 pigs, and 7 horses. Assume that all animals are distinguishable from each other. How many ways can he pair up the animals so that every pair consists of animals of different species? Instead of determining the total number of ways to pair up all the animals into mixed-species pairs, simply find $k = x + 2$, where $x$ is the number of cow-pig pairs in any such complete pairing. Compute the number of ways to color $k$ cells in a $3 \\times 3$ grid so that no two colored cells share an edge.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ k $. Farmer John has 5 cows (C), 4 pigs (P), and 7 horses (H). To form mixed-species pairs, let $ x $ be the number of cow-pig pairs, $ y $ cow-horse, and $ z $ pig-horse. The equations are:\\n- $ x + y = 5 $ (cows)\\n- $ x + z = 4 $ (pigs)\\n- $ y + z = 7 $ (horses)\\n\\nSolving: From the first two, $ y = 5 - x $, $ z = 4 - x $. Substituting into the third: $ (5 - x) + (4 - x) = 7 \\\\implies 9 - 2x = 7 \\\\implies x = 1 $. Thus, $ k = x + 2 = 3 $.\\n\\nNext, count the number of ways to color 3 cells in a $ 3 \\\\times 3 $ grid with no two adjacent. Total combinations: $ \\\\binom{9}{3} = 84 $. Subtract invalid cases (at least one adjacent pair). Using inclusion-exclusion and direct enumeration, valid configurations are:\\n- 4 (three corners)\\n- 4 (two corners, one edge center)\\n- 4 (one corner, two edge centers)\\n- 4 (three edge centers)\\n- 6 (center + two corners)\\nTotal: $ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 22 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"22\"\n}",
