  "math_problem": "Pyramid $E A R L Y$ is placed in $(x, y, z)$ coordinates so that $E=(10,10,0), A=(10,-10,0), R=(-10,-10,0), L=(-10,10,0)$, and $Y=(0,0,10)$. Tunnels are drilled through the pyramid in such a way that one can move from $(x, y, z)$ to any of the 9 points $(x, y, z-1),(x \\pm 1, y, z-1)$, $(x, y \\pm 1, z-1),(x \\pm 1, y \\pm 1, z-1)$. Sean starts at $Y$ and moves randomly down to the base of the pyramid, choosing each of the possible paths with probability $\\frac{1}{9}$ each time. What is the probability that he ends up at the point $(8,9,0)$? Instead of computing the probability of reaching the specified base point, simply find $p_y$, where $p_y$ is the number of steps with positive y-displacement required to achieve the net y-displacement to that point, derived from the total step count and net displacement equations in the y-direction. In a game, $N$ people are in a room. Each of them simultaneously writes down an integer between 0 and 100 inclusive. A person wins the game if their number is exactly $\\left(p_y - \\frac{25}{3}\\right)$ of the average of all the numbers written down. There can be multiple winners or no winners in this game. Let $m$ be the maximum possible number such that it is possible to win the game by writing down $m$. Find the smallest possible value of $N$ for which it is possible to win the game by writing down $m$ in a room of $N$ people.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ p_y $, the number of steps with positive y-displacement. Sean starts at $ Y = (0,0,10) $ and ends at $ (8,9,0) $, requiring 10 steps (since $ z $ decreases from 10 to 0). The net y-displacement is $ +9 $. Let $ p_y $ be steps with $ \\\\Delta y = +1 $, $ n_y $ with $ \\\\Delta y = -1 $, and $ z_y $ with $ \\\\Delta y = 0 $. Solving $ p_y - n_y = 9 $ and $ p_y + n_y + z_y = 10 $, we find $ p_y = 9 $ (since $ n_y = 0 $, $ z_y = 1 $).\\n\\nNext, compute $ p_y - \\\\frac{25}{3} = 9 - \\\\frac{25}{3} = \\\\frac{2}{3} $. The winning condition is a number $ m $ equal to $ \\\\frac{2}{3} $ of the average. For $ m $ to be maximum, $ \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\times \\\\text{average} \\\\leq 100 $, so the average $ \\\\leq 150 $, but since all numbers are $ \\\\leq 100 $, the average $ \\\\leq 100 $. Thus $ m \\\\leq \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\times 100 \\\\approx 66.67 $, so maximum integer $ m = 66 $.\\n\\nTo win with $ m = 66 $, the average must be $ 99 $ (since $ 66 = \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\times 99 $). For $ N $ people, if one writes $ 66 $ and $ N-1 $ write $ 100 $, the sum is $ 66 + 100(N-1) $. The average is $ \\\\frac{66 + 100(N-1)}{N} = 99 $. Solving $ 66 + 100(N-1) = 99N $ gives $ N = 34 $. Checking smaller $ N $: for $ N = 33 $, the required sum of others exceeds $ 32 \\\\times 100 $, making it impossible. Thus, the smallest $ N $ is 34.\",\n    \"answer\": \"34\"\n}",
