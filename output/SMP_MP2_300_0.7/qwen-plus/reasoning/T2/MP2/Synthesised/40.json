  "math_problem": "Solve the system of equations $p+3q+r=3$, $p+2q+3r=3$, $p+q+r=2$ for the ordered triple $(p, q, r)$. Instead of determining the ordered triple, simply find $k = p - \\frac{1}{4}$, where $p$ is the value of the first variable in the solution to the given system of equations. Is there an integer $n$ such that $\\sqrt{n-k}+\\sqrt{n+k}$ is a rational number?",

Substituting $ q = \\\\frac{1}{2} $: $ \\\\frac{1}{2} + 2r = 1 \\\\implies r = \\\\frac{1}{4} $.\\nSubstitute $ q $ and $ r $ into equation 3: $ p + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{4} = 2 \\\\implies p = \\\\frac{5}{4} $.\\n\\nCompute $ k = p - \\\\frac{1}{4} = \\\\frac{5}{4} - \\\\frac{1}{4} = 1 $.\\n\\nNow, check if there exists an integer $ n $ such that $ \\\\sqrt{n - k} + \\\\sqrt{n + k} = \\\\sqrt{n - 1} + \\\\sqrt{n + 1} $ is rational. Assume $ S = \\\\sqrt{n - 1} + \\\\sqrt{n + 1} $ is rational. Squaring both sides: $ S^2 = 2n + 2\\\\sqrt{n^2 - 1} $. For $ S $ to be rational, $ \\\\sqrt{n^2 - 1} $ must be rational. However, $ n^2 - 1 $ being a perfect square of a rational number implies $ n^2 - m^2 = 1 $ for some rational $ m $, which only holds for $ n = \\\\pm 1 $ (integer solutions). Testing $ n = 1 $: $ \\\\sqrt{0} + \\\\sqrt{2} = \\\\sqrt{2} $ (irrational). $ n = -1 $: $ \\\\sqrt{-2} $ is not real. No other integer $ n $ satisfies the condition, as shown by algebraic analysis of rational sums and perfect squares. Thus, no such integer $ n $ exists.\",\n    \"answer\": \"No\"\n}",
