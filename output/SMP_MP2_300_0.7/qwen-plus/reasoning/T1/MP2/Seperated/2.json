Your store sells only these two models. You plan to issue 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupons, limited to one per order, where x is an integer greater than 0 and smaller than 99. (For example, the discount for an order of 250 RMB is x RMB, not 2x RMB). The Tmall.com '60 RMB off 299 RMB' coupon can be applied to purchases at store B and can be stacked with your 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupon. What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less on either the 250 RMB pair of the headphones or the 600 RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A? What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less for buying both the 250 RMB pair of the headphones and the 600 RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Compute T = sum_{n=0}^7 2^n (-1)^{s(n)}. For n=0 to 7, binary representations and s(n) (number of 1s) are: n=0 (000, 0), n=1 (001, 1), n=2 (010, 1), n=3 (011, 2), n=4 (100, 1), n=5 (101, 2), n=6 (110, 2), n=7 (111, 3). Calculating terms: 1*1=1, 2*(-1)=-2, 4*(-1)=-4, 8*1=8, 16*(-1)=-16, 32*1=32, 64*1=64, 128*(-1)=-128. Summing: 1-2-4+8-16+32+64-128 = -45. Thus, T = -45. Then k = T + 46 = -45 + 46 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: For single items:\\n- Headphones (250 RMB): Store A price = 250 (no Tmall coupon, as 250 < 299). Store B price = 250 - x (x off 99 applies). Need 250 - x ≤ 249 ⇒ x ≥ 1.\\n- Speakers (600 RMB): Store A price = 600 - 60 = 540 (Tmall coupon applies). Store B price = 600 - x - 60 = 540 - x. Need 540 - x ≤ 539 ⇒ x ≥ 1.\\nMinimal x for either item is 1.\\n\\nFor buying both (250 + 600 = 850 RMB):\\n- Store A price = 850 - 60 = 790 (Tmall coupon applies).\\n- Store B price = 850 - x - 60 = 790 - x.
