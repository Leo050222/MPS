      "A3034": "A group of friends are sharing a bag of candy. On the first day, they eat $\frac{1}{2}$ of the candies in the bag. On the second day, they eat $\frac{2}{3}$ of the remaining candies. On the third day, they eat $\frac{3}{4}$ of the remaining candies. On the fourth day, they eat $\frac{4}{5}$ of the remaining candies. On the fifth day, they eat $\frac{5}{6}$ of the remaining candies. At the end of the fifth day, there is 1 candy remaining in the bag. How many candies were in the bag before the first day? Instead of determining the initial number of candies in the bag, simply find $k = r - 269$, where $r$ is the number of candies remaining after the first day derived from the consumption on the first day."

Each figure after the first is formed by adding 1 tile to the previous figure. How many tiles are used to form the figure in the sequence with perimeter 91 cm?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Working backwards from the 1 candy remaining after day 5. After day 5: 1 = (1/6) * remaining before day 5 → 6 candies. After day 4: 6 = (1/5) * remaining before day 4 → 30 candies. After day 3: 30 = (1/4) * remaining before day 3 → 120 candies. After day 2: 120 = (1/3) * remaining before day 2 → 360 candies. This 360 is the remaining after day 1 (r). Thus, k = 360 - 269 = 91.\\n\\nProblem 2: Each tile is an equilateral triangle (side 7 cm). The perimeter for n tiles arranged linearly follows P = 7(n + 2). Setting 7(n + 2) = 91 gives n + 2 = 13 → n = 11.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"91\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
