Calculating k = |S| + 2016 gives 5 + 2016 = 2021.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given 45a + b = 2021 with a, b positive integers, express b = 2021 - 45a. To minimize a + b, substitute b to get a + b = 2021 - 44a. This is minimized when a is maximized. The largest integer a satisfying 45a < 2021 is 44 (since 45*44 = 1980). Then b = 2021 - 1980 = 41, so a + b = 44 + 41 = 85.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2021\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"85\"\n}",
