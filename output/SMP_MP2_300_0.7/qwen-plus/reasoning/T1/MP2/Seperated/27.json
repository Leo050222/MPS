      "A3193": "In her last basketball game, Jackie scored 36 points. These points raised the average number of points that she scored per game from 20 to 21. To raise this average to 22 points, how many points must Jackie score in her next game? Instead of determining the score required in the subsequent game to achieve the next targeted average, simply find $e = (total_after - 333)$, where $total_after$ is the cumulative points scored upon attaining the intermediate average following the recent game."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let n be the number of games before the last game. Original total points: 20n. After scoring 36, total becomes 20n + 36, and average becomes 21 over n+1 games. Solving 20n + 36 = 21(n + 1) gives n = 15. Total points after the recent game: 21 * 16 = 336. Thus, e = 336 - 333 = 3.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let x be the number of 3-point baskets. Then 3x + 2(10 - x) = 26. Simplifying: x + 20 = 26 → x = 6.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
