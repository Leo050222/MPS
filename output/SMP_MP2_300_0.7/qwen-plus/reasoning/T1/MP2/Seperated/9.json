The total central angle of a circle is $360^\\\\circ$, so $4x + 20 + 140 = 360$. Solving gives $4x = 200 \\\\implies x = 50$. Assuming the shaded regions are the four regions with $x^\\\\circ$, the total shaded angle $\\\\theta = 4 \\\\times 50 = 200$. Then $N = \\\\theta + 2700 = 200 + 2700 = 2900$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Factorize $205800 = 2^3 \\\\cdot 3^1 \\\\cdot 5^2 \\\\cdot 7^3$ and $35k = 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot k$. The gcd must be a perfect square, so exponents in the gcd must be even.
