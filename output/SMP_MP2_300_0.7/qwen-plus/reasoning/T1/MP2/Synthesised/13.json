  "math_problem": "Two different numbers are randomly selected from the set $\\{-3, -1, 0, 2, 4\\}$ and then multiplied together. What is the probability that the product of the two numbers chosen is 0? Instead of determining the probability that the product of the two selected numbers is zero, simply find $k = |S| + 2016$, where $|S|$ is the number of elements in the given set. Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers for which $45a + b = k$. What is the minimum possible value of $a + b$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding the minimum value of $a + b$ where $45a + b = k$, and $k = |S| + 2016$. The set $S = \\\\{-3, -1, 0, 2, 4\\\\}$ has $|S| = 5$, so $k = 5 + 2016 = 2021$. We solve $45a + b = 2021$ with $a, b$ as positive integers. Rearranging gives $b = 2021 - 45a$, and $a + b = 2021 - 44a$. To minimize $a + b$, maximize $a$ such that $b > 0$. The largest valid $a$ is $44$ (since $45 \\\\times 44 = 1980$ and $b = 2021 - 1980 = 41$). Thus, $a + b = 44 + 41 = 85$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"85\"\n}",
