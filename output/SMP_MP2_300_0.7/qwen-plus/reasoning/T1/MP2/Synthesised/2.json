  "math_problem": "Let $s(n)$ denote the number of 1's in the binary representation of $n$. Compute $$\\frac{1}{255} \\sum_{0 \\leq n<16} 2^{n}(-1)^{s(n)}$$ Instead of evaluating the provided expression, simply find $k = T + 46$, where $T = \\sum_{n=0}^{7} 2^{n} (-1)^{s(n)}$ is the alternating sum over the subrange of length 8. You plan to open your own Tmall.com store, called 'Store B,' selling the same headphones and speaker set at the same list prices as Store A does. Your store sells only these two models. You plan to issue 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupons, limited to one per order, where x is an integer greater than 0 and smaller than 99. (For example, the discount for an order of 250 RMB is x RMB, not 2x RMB). The Tmall.com '60 RMB off 299 RMB' coupon can be applied to purchases at store B and can be stacked with your 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupon. What is the minimal number x such that $k \\leq x < 99$ and Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less on either the 250 RMB pair of the headphones or the 600 RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A? What is the minimal number x such that $k \\leq x < 99$ and Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less for buying both the 250 RMB pair of the headphones and the 600 RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute T = sum_{n=0}^7 2^n (-1)^{s(n)}, where s(n) is the number of 1's in binary n. For n=0 to 7:\\n- n=0 (000): s=0, term=1*1=1\\n- n=1 (001): s=1, term=2*(-1)=-2\\n- n=2 (010): s=1, term=4*(-1)=-4\\n- n=3 (011): s=2, term=8*1=8\\n- n=4 (100): s=1, term=16*(-1)=-16\\n- n=5 (101): s=2, term=32*1=32\\n- n=6 (110): s=2, term=64*1=64\\n- n=7 (111): s=3, term=128*(-1)=-128\\nSum: 1 - 2 - 4 + 8 - 16 + 32 + 64 - 128 = -45. Thus, T = -45.\\nThen k = T + 46 = -45 + 46 = 1.\\n\\nFor the headphones (250 RMB):\\n- Store B discount: x (since 250 ≥ 99, but <299 so no 60 off).\\n- Price in B: 250 - x. To save ≥1 RMB: 250 - x ≤ 249 ⇒ x ≥ 1.\\n\\nFor the speakers (600 RMB):\\n- Store B discount: x + 60 (both coupons apply).\\n- Price in B: 600 - (x + 60) = 540 - x. Saving is 60 + x ≥ 61 ≥ 1 for any x ≥ 1.\\n\\nFor both items (850 RMB):\\n- Store B discount: x + 60.\\n- Price in B: 850 - (x + 60) = 790 - x. Saving is 60 + x ≥ 61 ≥ 1 for any x ≥ 1.\\n\\nSince k = 1, the minimal x satisfying k ≤ x < 99 is x = 1, which works for all cases.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
