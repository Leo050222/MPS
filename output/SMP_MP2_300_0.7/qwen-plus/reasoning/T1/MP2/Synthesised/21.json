  "math_problem": "It takes Pearl 7 days to dig 4 holes. It takes Miguel 3 days to dig 2 holes. If they work together and each continues digging at these same rates, how many holes in total will they dig in 21 days? Instead of determining the total number of holes dug together over the 21-day period, simply find $\\delta = h_m - 8$, where $h_m$ is the number of holes the second worker would dig alone in 21 days derived from his rate of 2 holes in 3 days. A hockey team has $\\delta$ more red helmets than blue helmets. The ratio of red helmets to blue helmets is $5:3$. What is the total number of red helmets and blue helmets?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, calculate the number of holes Miguel digs alone in 21 days. Miguel's rate is 2 holes in 3 days, so his daily rate is $\\\\frac{2}{3}$ holes/day. In 21 days, he digs $h_m = \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\times 21 = 14$ holes. Then $\\\\delta = h_m - 8 = 14 - 8 = 6$. Next, let $B$ be the number of blue helmets. Red helmets are $R = B + 6$. The ratio $R:B = 5:3$ gives $\\\\frac{B + 6}{B} = \\\\frac{5}{3}$. Solving: $3(B + 6) = 5B \\\\implies 3B + 18 = 5B \\\\implies 2B = 18 \\\\implies B = 9$. Thus, $R = 9 + 6 = 15$. Total helmets are $15 + 9 = 24$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"24\"\n}",
