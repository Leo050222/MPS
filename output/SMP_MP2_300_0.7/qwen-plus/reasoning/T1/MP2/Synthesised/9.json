  "math_problem": "What is the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region if a circular spinner is divided into six regions, four regions each have a central angle of $x^{\\circ}$, and the remaining regions have central angles of $20^{\\circ}$ and $140^{\\circ}$, where the shaded regions consist of the $140^{\\circ}$ region and two of the $x^{\\circ}$ regions? Instead of computing the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region, simply find $N = \\theta + 2700$, where $\\theta$ is the total central angle in degrees of the shaded regions. We call the pair $(m, n)$ of positive integers a happy pair if the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is a perfect square. For example, $(20, 24)$ is a happy pair because the greatest common divisor of 20 and 24 is 4. Suppose that $k$ is a positive integer such that $(205800, 35k)$ is a happy pair. What is the number of possible values of $k$ with $k \\leq N$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the central angle $x$ for the spinner. The total degrees in a circle is 360°, so $4x + 20 + 140 = 360$. Solving gives $4x = 200 \\\\implies x = 50$. The shaded regions consist of the $140^\\\\circ$ region and two $x^\\\\circ$ regions, so $\\\\theta = 140 + 2 \\\\times 50 = 240$. Thus, $N = \\\\theta + 2700 = 240 + 2700 = 2940$.\\n\\nNext, analyze the happy pair condition for $(205800, 35k)$. Factorize $205800 = 2^3 \\\\cdot 3^1 \\\\cdot 5^2 \\\\cdot 7^3$. The gcd must be a perfect square, so exponents in the gcd must be even. For $35k = 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot k$, the prime exponents in $k$ must satisfy:\\n- Prime 2: $\\\\min(3, v_2(k))$ even $\\\\implies v_2(k) \\\\in \\\\{0, 2\\\\}$\\n- Prime 3: $\\\\min(1, v_3(k))$ even $\\\\implies v_3(k) = 0$\\n- Prime 5: $\\\\min(2, v_5(k) + 1)$ even $\\\\implies v_5(k) \\\\geq 1$\\n- Prime 7: $\\\\min(3, v_7(k) + 1)$ even $\\\\implies v_7(k) = 1$\\n- Other primes: No restriction (exponents in gcd are 0, which is even).\\n\\nThus, $k = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot m$ where $a \\\\in \\\\{0, 2\\\\}$, $c \\\\geq 1$, $m \\\\geq 1$, and $\\\\gcd(m, 210) = 1$. Count valid $k \\\\leq 2940$:\\n- **Case 1 ($a = 0$)**: $k = 7 \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 2940 \\\\implies 5^c \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 420$\\n  - $c = 1$: $m \\\\leq 84$, 20 valid $m$\\n  - $c = 2$: $m \\\\leq 16$, 3 valid $m$\\n  - $c = 3$: $m \\\\leq 3$, 1 valid $m$\\n  - Total: $20 + 3 + 1 = 24$\\n- **Case 2 ($a = 2$)**: $k = 28 \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 2940 \\\\implies 5^c \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 105$\\n  - $c = 1$: $m \\\\leq 21$, 5 valid $m$\\n  - $c = 2$: $m \\\\leq 4$, 1 valid $m$\\n  - Total: $5 + 1 = 6$\\n\\nTotal valid $k$: $24 + 6 = 30$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"30\"\n}",
