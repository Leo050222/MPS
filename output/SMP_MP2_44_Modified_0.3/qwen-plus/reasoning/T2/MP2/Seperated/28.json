First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill 11. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?"

Substitute into the first two equations:\\n- First equation: $ x(19 - x - z) + z = 40 \\\\Rightarrow -x^2 + 19x - xz + z = 40 $\\n- Second equation: $ xz + (19 - x - z) = 51 \\\\Rightarrow xz - z - x = 32 $\\nSolving for $ z $ from both equations:\\n- From first: $ z = \\\\frac{x^2 - 19x + 40}{1 - x} $\\n- From second: $ z = \\\\frac{x + 32}{x - 1} $\\nEquating and simplifying gives $ x^2 - 18x + 72 = 0 $, with roots $ x = 6 $ and $ x = 12 $.\\n- For $ x = 6 $: $ z = \\\\frac{6 + 32}{6 - 1} = \\\\frac{38}{5} $\\n- For $ x = 12 $: $ z = \\\\frac{12 + 32}{12 - 1} = 4 $\\nThe problem specifies the solution corresponding to the smaller root for $ x + 1 $. The roots for $ x $ are 6 and 12, so $ x + 1 $ are 7 and 13. The smaller root is 7 (from $ x = 6 $), so $ z = \\\\frac{38}{5} $. Compute $ k = z + \\\\frac{17}{5} = \\\\frac{38 + 17}{5} = \\\\frac{55}{5} = 11 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Alice (skill 11) has 10 players with lower skill (L) and 10 with higher skill (H). The expected number of games she plays is derived as follows:\\n- She always plays exactly 1 game against a higher-skill player (the first H she faces).\\n- The expected number of lower-skill players she plays against is $ \\\\frac{L}{L + H + 1} = \\\\frac{10}{21} $.\\n- Total expected games: $ 1 + \\\\frac{10}{21} = \\\\frac{31}{21} $.\\nThis result is validated by smaller cases (e.g., 3-player tournament) where the formula holds.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"31/21\"\n}",
