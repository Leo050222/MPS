  "math_problem": "When three consecutive integers are added, the total is 27. What is the result when the same three integers are multiplied? Instead of determining the product of the three consecutive integers, simply find $p = \\left(m - \\frac{177}{20}\\right)$, where $m$ is the middle integer among the three consecutive integers. If $x \\%$ of 60 is 12, what is $100\\left(p\\right) \\%$ of $x$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find the three consecutive integers. Let the middle integer be $ m $. The sum of three consecutive integers is $ (m-1) + m + (m+1) = 3m $. Given the sum is 27, $ 3m = 27 $ so $ m = 9 $. Next, compute $ p = m - \\\\frac{177}{20} = 9 - 8.85 = 0.15 $. For the percentage part, $ x\\\\% $ of 60 is 12: $ \\\\frac{x}{100} \\\\times 60 = 12 $ gives $ x = 20 $. Now, $ 100(p)\\\\% = 15\\\\% $. Calculate $ 15\\\\% $ of $ x = 20 $: $ 0.15 \\\\times 20 = 3 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
