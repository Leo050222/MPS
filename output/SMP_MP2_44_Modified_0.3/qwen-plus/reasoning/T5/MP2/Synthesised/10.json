  "math_problem": "Let $A$ be the set of all integers $n$ such that $1 \\leq n \\leq 2021$ and $\\gcd(n, 2021) = 1$. For every nonnegative integer $j$, let\n\\[S(j) = \\sum_{n \\in A} n^j.\\]\nDetermine all values of $j$ such that $S(j)$ is a multiple of 2021. Instead of determining the nonnegative integers $j$ for which the power sum over the residues coprime to the modulus is divisible by the modulus, simply find $k = d - 1$, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of the distinct prime factors of the modulus. Determine the maximum value of the sum\n\\[S = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{n}{2^n} (a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n)^{1/n}\\]\nover all sequences $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\cdots$ of real numbers satisfying $a_k \\geq k$ for each $k$ and\n\\[\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty a_k = 1.\\]",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem instructs to find $k = d - 1$, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of the distinct prime factors of the modulus 2021. First, factorize 2021: $2021 = 43 \\\\times 47$, where 43 and 47 are distinct primes. The distinct prime factors are 43 and 47. The greatest common divisor of these primes is $\\\\gcd(43, 47) = 1$ since they are distinct primes. Thus, $d = 1$, and $k = d - 1 = 0$. The second part of the problem statement about the sum $S$ appears to be extraneous or a misdirection, as the instructions explicitly state to focus on computing $k = d - 1$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
