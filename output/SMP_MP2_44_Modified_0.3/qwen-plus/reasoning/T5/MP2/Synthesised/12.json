  "math_problem": "Let $F_m$ be the $m$th Fibonacci number, defined by $F_1 = F_2 = 1$ and $F_m = F_{m-1} + F_{m-2}$ for all $m \\geq 3$. Let $p(x)$ be the polynomial of degree $1008$ such that $p(2n+1) = F_{2n+1}$ for $n=0,1,2,\\dots,1008$. Find integers $j$ and $k$ such that $p(2019) = F_j - F_k$. Instead of determining integers $j$ and $k$ such that the value of the interpolating polynomial at a point beyond the range of interpolation points equals the difference of two Fibonacci numbers, simply find $d = N - 1008$, where $N$ is the degree of the polynomial. Determine the smallest real number $r > d$ such that there exist differentiable functions $f\\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and $g\\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying \\begin{enumerate} \\item[(a)] $f(d) > d$, \\item[(b)] $g(d) = d$, \\item[(c)] $|f'(x)| \\leq |g(x)|$ for all $x$, \\item[(d)] $|g'(x)| \\leq |f(x)|$ for all $x$, and \\item[(e)] $f(r) = d$. \\end{enumerate}",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding the smallest real number $ r > d $ where $ d = N - 1008 $, and $ N $ is the degree of the polynomial $ p(x) $. Since $ p(x) $ is given as a polynomial of degree 1008, $ N = 1008 $, so $ d = 1008 - 1008 = 0 $. \\n\\nNext, we analyze the conditions for differentiable functions $ f $ and $ g $:\\n- $ f(0) > 0 $ (from $ f(d) > d $ with $ d = 0 $),\\n- $ g(0) = 0 $ (from $ g(d) = d $),\\n- $ |f'(x)| \\\\leq |g(x)| $ for all $ x $,\\n- $ |g'(x)| \\\\leq |f(x)| $ for all $ x $,\\n- $ f(r) = 0 $ (from $ f(r) = d $).\\n\\nAssuming equality in the differential inequalities (to minimize $ r $), we solve the system $ f' = -g $ and $ g' = f $, leading to $ f'' + f = 0 $. The solution is $ f(x) = a \\\\cos x $ and $ g(x) = a \\\\sin x $ for $ a > 0 $. This satisfies all conditions, with $ f(r) = 0 $ implying $ \\\\cos r = 0 $, so the smallest $ r > 0 $ is $ \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} $. \\n\\nUsing differential inequality analysis, any $ r < \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} $ would fail to satisfy $ f(r) = 0 $, confirming $ \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} $ as the minimal value.\",\n    \"answer\": \"pi/2\"\n}",
