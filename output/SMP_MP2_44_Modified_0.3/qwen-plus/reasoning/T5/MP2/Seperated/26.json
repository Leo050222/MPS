Instead of finding all functions satisfying the given functional equation and limit condition, simply find $k = f(1) + 1$, where $f(1)$ is the constant factor in the scaling relation $f(f(y)) = f(1) y$ derived from the functional equation."

Setting $x = 1$ gives $f(f(y)) = f(1)y$. Let $c = f(1)$. Setting $y = 1$ yields $f(cx) = f(x)$. Substituting $y \\\\to f(y)$ into the original equation gives $f(cxy) = f(x)f(y)$. Setting $x = 1$ here gives $f(cy) = cf(y)$. Combining $f(cy) = f(y)$ and $f(cy) = cf(y)$ implies $f(y) = cf(y)$, so $c = 1$. Thus $f(1) = 1$, so $k = f(1) + 1 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The product $(x_1^2 + 1)\\\\cdots(x_4^2 + 1)$ equals $|P(i)|^2 = (1 - b + d)^2 + (c - a)^2$. Given $b - d \\\\geq 5$, let $u = b - d \\\\geq 5$. The expression becomes $(1 - u)^2 + (c - a)^2$. Minimizing requires $u = 5$ (smallest $u$) and $c = a$ (to eliminate the second term). For $P(x) = (x - 1)^4$, $b = 6$, $d = 1$, so $b - d = 5$, and $c = a = -4$, giving $(1 - 5)^2 + 0 = 16$. This is achievable and minimal, as other configurations yield larger values.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"16\"\n}",
