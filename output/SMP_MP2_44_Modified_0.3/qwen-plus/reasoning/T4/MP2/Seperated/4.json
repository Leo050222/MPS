Larger n < 100 (e.g., 68, 70, ..., 98) fail divisibility. Thus, n=66. Then e = 66 + 1926 = 1992.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of regions formed by h horizontal and s non-horizontal lines (no two parallel, no three concurrent) is given by R = 1 + h(s+1) + s(s+1)/2 = 1992. Simplifying gives (s+1)(2h + s) = 3982. Factoring 3982 = 2×11×181, valid positive integer pairs (h,s) are derived from factor pairs of 3982 where h = (b - a + 1)/2 > 0.
