In each move, Sir Alex is allowed to perform exactly one of the following two operations:\n[list=1]\n[*] Choose any number of the form $2^j$, where $j$ is a non-negative integer, and put it into an empty cell.\n[*] Choose two (not necessarily adjacent) cells with the same number in them; denote that number by $2^j$. Replace the number in one of the cells with $2^{j+1}$ and erase the number in the other cell.\n[/list]\nAt the end of the game, one cell contains $2^n$, where $n$ is a given positive integer, while the other cells are empty.

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The functional equation is analyzed by setting x=0, yielding f(2y) = f(y) + y + (f(0) - 1). Assuming an affine solution f(x) = mx + b, substituting into the relation f(2y) = f(y) + y (derived from the problem's context) gives 2my + b = my + b + y, leading to m = 1. Verifying with the original equation confirms f(x) = x + 1 is the unique affine solution, so the coefficient a = 1. Thus, k = a + 8 = 9.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize moves, Sir Alex places as many 2^0s as possible (operation 1) and combines them (operation 2) while keeping non-empty cells ≤9. The total sum must be 2^n, requiring A = 2^n operation 1 moves (placing 2^0s) and B = 2^n - 1 operation 2 moves (combining). The constraint of 9 cells is satisfied by interleaving operations to maintain ≤9 non-empty cells. Total moves = A + B = 2^{n+1} - 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2^{n+1}-1\"\n}",
