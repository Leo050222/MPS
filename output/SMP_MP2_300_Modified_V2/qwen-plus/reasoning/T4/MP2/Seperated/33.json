Since $a$ and $b$ are coprime to $2n$, $c$ is also coprime to $2n$, so $\\\\gcd(c, 2n) = 1$. Thus, $d = 1 + 3 = 4$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume $f(x) = kx$. Substituting into the equation gives $k = 1$ (since $k = 0$ violates condition (i)). Verifying $f(x) = x$: it satisfies the functional equation and has only one zero ($s = 0$), meeting condition (i). Further analysis shows no other solutions exist due to injectivity and the requirement of finitely many zeros.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = x\"\n}",
