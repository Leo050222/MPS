At any point, Evan may pick two of the numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) written on the board and write either their arithmetic mean \\(\\tfrac{x+y}{2}\\) or their harmonic mean \\(\\tfrac{2xy}{x+y}\\) on the board as well. Find all pairs \\((m,n)\\) such that Evan can write 1 on the board in finitely many steps. Instead of determining all initial pairs of relatively prime positive integers that permit writing the number 1 on the board, simply find \\(k = d + 1\\), where \\(d\\) is the odd part of the sum of the numerator and denominator for the reduced fractions initially on the board."

The sum of numerator and denominator for each reduced fraction (1/1) is 1+1=2. Summing both fractions gives 2+2=4. The odd part of 4 is 1, so d=1. Thus, k = d + 1 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Testing constant and polynomial functions, the only solutions satisfying the functional equation for all real x,y are f(x)=0 and f(x)=x². Verification confirms these work, and no other solutions exist due to degree analysis and substitution checks.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=0 and f(x)=x^2\"\n}",
