Instead of finding the floor of the product of the next successive integer and the value of $P$ evaluated at that integer, simply find $d = Q(0) + 5$, where $Q(x) = x^{2} P(x) - 1$ is the auxiliary polynomial derived from the given interpolation condition."

Q(x) is degree 2017 (as P is degree 2015). Evaluating at x=0: Q(0) = 0²P(0) - 1 = -1. Thus, d = Q(0) + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let roots be a, b, c, d with ab = -32. By Vieta: abcd = -1984 ⇒ cd = (-1984)/(-32) = 62. Let S1 = a + b, S2 = c + d. Then S1 + S2 = 18. Sum of three-root products: abS2 + cdS1 = -200 ⇒ -32S2 + 62S1 = -200. Substituting S2 = 18 - S1: -32(18 - S1) + 62S1 = -200 ⇒ 94S1 = 376 ⇒ S1 = 4, S2 = 14. Then k = ab + cd + S1S2 = -32 + 62 + 56 = 86.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"86\"\n}",
