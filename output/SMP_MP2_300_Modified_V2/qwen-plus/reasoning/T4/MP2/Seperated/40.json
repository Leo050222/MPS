Checking k=2: only pair (1,2), difference 1 mod 2 ≠ 0. k=3: all differences mod 3 are non-zero. k=4: for m=1, n=3, 3^2 - 1^0 = 8 ≡ 0 mod 4. Thus, k=4 is the smallest such k, so s = k-1 = 3.\\n\\nProblem 2: The sequence must satisfy a_n divisible by a_{n-1} and a_{n-2}+a_{n-1} for n ≥ 3. Starting with minimal a1=1, a2=1, we find a3=2 (div by 1 and 2), a4=6 (div by 2 and 3), a5=24 (div by 6 and 8), etc. This follows a_n = (n-1)! for n ≥ 2. For 2020 terms, the last term is a_{2020} = 2019!.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2019!\"\n}",
