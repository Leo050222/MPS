Instead of determining all natural numbers $n$ for which there exist real numbers satisfying the given condition on absolute differences, simply find $k = N + 40$, where $N$ is the number of distinct absolute differences required for the configuration with five real numbers derived from the structural consideration of the pairwise differences in the problem setup."

For n=5, the number of pairwise differences is C(5,2) = 10. The problem states that N is the number of distinct absolute differences required, which corresponds to the size of the set {1, 2, ..., C(5,2)}. Thus, N = 10. Therefore, k = 10 + 40 = 50.\\n\\nProblem 2: Solving the system of equations, we test integer solutions and find that (x, y, z) = (2, 4, 6) satisfies all three equations. Substituting x=2, y=4, z=6 into each equation confirms validity. Further analysis shows no other real solutions exist due to the monotonicity and structure of the equations, confirming uniqueness.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"50\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(2,4,6)\"\n}",
