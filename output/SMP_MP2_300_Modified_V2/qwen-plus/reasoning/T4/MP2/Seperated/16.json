Instead of determining all such pairs of monic complex polynomials satisfying the given divisibility conditions, simply find $k = T + 14$, where $T$ is the constant satisfying $P^{2} + Q^{2} + 1 = P Q T$ for pairs $P, Q$ meeting the conditions."

By examining degrees and leading coefficients, we find that for non-constant polynomials, the equation $P^2 + Q^2 + 1 = PQT$ must hold with $T = 2$. This is verified through examples (linear polynomials) and algebraic manipulation showing that $P = Q \\\\pm i$ satisfies the conditions and yields $T = 2$. The constant pair $(1,1)$ gives $T = 3$, but the problem focuses on non-trivial pairs where $T$ is uniquely determined as 2. Thus, $k = T + 14 = 16$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using combinatorial design and coding theory, we model students as vectors with answers per problem. The condition that any two students share at most one common answer translates to a constraint on agreeing pairs. By Cauchy-Schwarz and Singleton bound analysis, the maximum number of problems $n$ satisfies $24n \\\\leq 120$, giving $n \\\\leq 5$. A construction using affine geometry $AG(2,4)$ confirms $n = 5$ is achievable, as 16 points (students) in this plane have exactly one common line (problem answer) per pair.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"16\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"5\"\n}",
