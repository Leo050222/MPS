This is derived from the requirement that $ a_n - g_n \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod m $ for all $ n > 1 $ while $ a_2 - a_1 \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod m $. Through examples and modular analysis, it is shown that $ r \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod p $ for all prime factors $ p $ of $ m $, leading to $ \\\\gcd(r, m) = 1 $. Thus, $ k = \\\\gcd(r, m) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: By substituting specific values (e.g., $ x = 0 $, $ y = 0 $) and analyzing functional equations, we determine $ f(0) = 0 $. Testing constant and polynomial solutions, we find $ f(x) = 0 $ and $ f(x) = x^2 $ satisfy the equation. Further analysis shows these are the only solutions, as non-polynomial or other forms lead to contradictions or reduce to these cases.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=0 and f(x)=x^2\"\n}",
