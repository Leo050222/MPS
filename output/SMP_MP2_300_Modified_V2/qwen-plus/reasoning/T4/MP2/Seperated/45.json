Here, $|S|$ denotes the number of elements in the set $S$. Instead of determining the total number of such triples of sets, simply find $m = |A \\cap B \\cap C|$, where $|A \\cap B \\cap C|$ is the size of the triple intersection derived from the structural consideration of configurations with no elements belonging to exactly two of the sets."

Thus, all pairwise intersections must equal the triple intersection. Given |A ∩ B| = |B ∩ C| = |C ∩ A| = 2, the triple intersection size m must be 2. Verifying with set sizes: each set has 4 elements, so only regions are triple intersection (m) and single sets (4 - m each). Total elements: 3*(4 - m) + m = 8 ⇒ m = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: To have red visible on exactly 4 faces, consider combinations of red cube positions:\\n- Case 1: Two adjacent corners (12 pairs), union of faces = 4.\\n- Case 2: Corner and edge cube sharing 1 face (8*6 = 48 pairs).\\n- Case 3: Corner and face center on opposite face (8*3 = 24 pairs).\\n- Case 4: Two edge cubes with disjoint face sets (30 pairs).\\nTotal: 12 + 48 + 24 + 30 = 114.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"114\"\n}",
