The condition f(x²) ≡ f(x)² + 15 mod 17 requires f(1) = a where a² - a + 15 ≡ 0 mod 17, giving a = 2 or 16. For a = 2 (the case with two valid level 1 choices), f(16) = b has solutions b = 2 or 15. For b = 2, f(4) and f(13) each have 2 choices (total 4); for b = 15, both must be 0 (total 1). Thus, a₂ = 5, so k = 5 + 4 = 9.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let roots of f(x) = x³ + x + 1 be α, β, γ. By Vieta, α + β + γ = 0, αβ + αγ + βγ = 1, αβγ = -1. Roots of g are α², β², γ². Compute coefficients: sum of squares = -2, sum of products = 1, product = 1. Thus, g(x) = x³ + 2x² + x - 1. Evaluating at 9 gives 9³ + 2·9² + 9 - 1 = 899.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"899\"\n}",
