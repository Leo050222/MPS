  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The problem requires computing $ d = \\\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) + 1644 $, where $ \\\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) $ is the maximum number of edges in a $ K_6 $-free graph on 30 vertices. By Turán's theorem, the extremal graph for $ \\\\mathrm{ex}(n, K_r) $ is the complete $ (r-1) $-partite graph with partitions as equal as possible. For $ n = 30 $ and $ r = 6 $, the Turán graph $ T(30, 5) $ has 5 partitions of 6 vertices each. The number of edges is calculated as $ \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( 30^2 - 5 \\\\cdot 6^2 \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{2}(900 - 180) = 360 $. Thus, $ \\\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) = 360 $, and $ d = 360 + 1644 = 2004 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Consider the equation $ 2003^x + 2004^x = 2005^x $. Dividing both sides by $ 2005^x $ gives $ \\\\left( \\\\frac{2003}{2005} \\\\right)^x + \\\\left( \\\\frac{2004}{2005} \\\\right)^x = 1 $. Let $ f(x) = a^x + b^x - 1 $ where $ 0 < a, b < 1 $. The function $ f(x) $ is strictly decreasing because its derivative is negative (as $ \\\\ln a, \\\\ln b < 0 $). At $ x = 0 $, $ f(0) = 2 - 1 = 1 > 0 $. As $ x \\\\to \\\\infty $, $ f(x) \\\\to 0 + 0 - 1 = -1 < 0 $. Since $ f(x) $ is continuous and strictly decreasing, it crosses zero exactly once. For $ x < 0 $, $ f(x) > 0 $ (as both terms grow exponentially), so there is exactly one real solution.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2004\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
