      "A3214": "Alice and Bob play a game on a board consisting of one row of 2022 consecutive squares. They take turns placing tiles that cover two adjacent squares, with Alice going first. By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule. Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends; Bob's goal is to minimize it. What is the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure at the end of the game, no matter how Bob plays?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we find that valid n must satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 4. For n=1, the solution is trivial (k₁=1), but structural considerations in Egyptian fractions typically exclude 1 as a denominator. The minimal non-trivial n is 3, with solution (2, 3, 6). Here, one part equals n=3, which aligns with structural considerations. Thus, k=3, so e=3+2021=2024.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a board of 2022 squares (divisible by 3), Alice can ensure 2022/3=674 uncovered squares by strategically placing dominoes to isolate every third square, leveraging the minimum maximal matching size in path graphs. This strategy works regardless of Bob's moves, ensuring 674 uncovered squares.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2024\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"674\"\n}",
