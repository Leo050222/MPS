For odd exponents, $a^k + b^k = (a + b)(\\\\text{other factor})$. Since $p$ is prime, both factors must be powers of $p$. When $a = b$, the equation simplifies to $2a^{2013} = p^n$, implying $p = 2$ (as $2$ must be the prime factor). Cases where $a \\\\neq b$ lead to contradictions via modular arithmetic and LTE, showing no other primes work. Thus, $p = 2$ is the only prime.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need $C(2^n + 1) = C(n)$, where $C(k)$ is the sum of distinct prime divisors. Testing small $n$: $n=3$ gives $2^3 + 1 = 9$ (prime sum $3$) and $C(3) = 3$, which matches. For other $n$, $C(2^n + 1)$ grows much faster than $C(n)$ due to additional prime factors in $2^n + 1$. Mihăilescu's theorem confirms $2^n + 1$ is a prime power only for $n=1, 3$, but $n=1$ fails. No other $n$ satisfies the condition.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
