This gives $ f(1^3) = 1^2 f(1) + f(0) $, simplifying to $ f(1) = f(1) + f(0) $, hence $ f(0) = 0 $. Thus, $ k = 0 + 1 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a sequence of non-zero integers where any 7 consecutive terms sum to positive and any 11 consecutive terms sum to negative, the maximal length is derived by analyzing overlapping sums. Using partial sums $ S_k $, contradictions arise when $ n = 17 $ due to equal coefficient sums for 7-term and 11-term conditions. A valid sequence of length 16 exists (e.g., alternating -5 and 13), confirming maximal length 16.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"16\"\n}",
