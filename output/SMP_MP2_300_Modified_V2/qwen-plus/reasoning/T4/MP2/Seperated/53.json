Instead of determining the polynomial's value at the point immediately following the last given evaluation point, simply find $q = Q(-1)$, where $Q(x)$ is the auxiliary polynomial of degree $n+1$ defined by $Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x$."

Evaluating at x = -1: Q(-1) = (-1+1)P(-1) - (-1) = 0 + 1 = 1. This holds regardless of n, so q = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let z = a + bi. Given |z - 1| = 2 ⇒ (a-1)² + b² = 4. Given |z² - 1| = 6 ⇒ (a² - b² - 1)² + (2ab)² = 36. Expanding the second equation: (a² + b²)² - 2(a² - b²) + 1 = 36. Let S = a² + b², then from first equation S = 2a + 3. Substitute into second equation: (2a + 3)² - 2(2a² - 2a - 3) = 35 ⇒ 16a + 15 = 35 ⇒ a = 5/4.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"5/4\"\n}",
