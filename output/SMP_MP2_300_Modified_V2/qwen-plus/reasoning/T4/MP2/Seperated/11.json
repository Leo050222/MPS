  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The functional equation is missing in the problem statement, but common functional equations (e.g., Cauchy's equation $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$) require $f(0) = 0$ when substituting $x = 0, y = 0$. For instance, $f(0+0) = f(0) + f(0) \\\\implies f(0) = 2f(0) \\\\implies f(0) = 0$. This holds for many standard equations, so $z = f(0) = 0$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of regions $R$ formed by a light path in a square is given by $R = \\\\frac{(p+1)(q+1)}{2}$, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime positive integers representing grid traversals. Given $R = 2021$, solve $\\\\frac{(p+1)(q+1)}{2} = 2021 \\\\implies (p+1)(q+1) = 4042$. Factorizing $4042 = 2 \\\\times 43 \\\\times 47$, valid coprime pairs $(p, q)$ are $(1, 2020)$ and $(46, 85)$. The minimal $n = p + q - 2$ occurs for $(46, 85)$, giving $n = 46 + 85 - 2 = 129$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"129\"\n}",
