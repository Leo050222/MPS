  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We consider consecutive positive integers $a$ and $b$, so $|a - b| = 1$. For pairs where both fractions are integers, we analyze cases $b = a + 1$ and $a = b + 1$. When $b = a + 1$, the first fraction simplifies to 1 for all $a$, and the second fraction must be integer. Checking small values, only $a = 2$, $b = 3$ works (second fraction = 11). Similarly, for $a = b + 1$, $a = 3$, $b = 2$ gives the first fraction as 11. However, the problem specifies $k$ as the value of $\\\\frac{a^2 + b}{b^2 - a}$ for consecutive pairs. For $(a, b) = (2, 3)$, $k = 1$. Thus, $e = 1 + 2022 = 2023$.\\n\\nProblem 2: $d$ is the gcd of $P(n)$ for all $n > 2023$, where $P(n) = \\\\prod_{k=1}^{40} (n - k^3)$. For a prime $p$ to divide $d$, every residue mod $p$ must be a cubic residue. This occurs when $\\\\gcd(3, p-1) = 1$ (or $p = 3$). Valid primes $\\\\leq 40$ are $2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 23, 29$. For each, compute the minimum number of $k$ such that $k^3 \\\\equiv n \\\\mod p$ for some $n$, which gives the exponent in $d$. Summing exponents: $20 + 13 + 8 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 48$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2023\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"48\"\n}",
