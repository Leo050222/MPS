Since ∠ABC ≥ 90°, sin B ≤ 1, so b ≤ 4. The maximum value of b occurs when ∠ABC = 90°, making AC the diameter of the circle (length 4). For the quartic equation to have real roots, constraints from the triangle and polynomial analysis lead to the conclusion that b must equal 4 (the only feasible value satisfying all conditions). Thus, k = b + 2013 = 4 + 2013 = 2017.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need to count ordered arrays (x₁,..., x₁₀₀) with entries in {1, 2,..., 2017} such that both the sum and sum of squares are divisible by 2017 (a prime). Using character sums over finite fields, the number of solutions for n-tuples satisfying two independent congruences (linear and quadratic) modulo a prime p is p^{n-2}. Here, p = 2017 and n = 100, so the count is 2017^{98}.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2017\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2017^98\"\n}",
