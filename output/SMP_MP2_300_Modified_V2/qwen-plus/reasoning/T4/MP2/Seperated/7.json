By checking small primes and using modular arithmetic, we find the valid ordered triples are cyclic permutations of (2, 5, 3). Specifically, the triples are (2, 5, 3), (3, 2, 5), and (5, 3, 2). In each triple, r is the third element. The problem asks for k = r + 2004 where r divides p^q + 1. For the triple (3, 2, 5), r = 5 satisfies 5 | 3^2 + 1 = 10. Thus, k = 5 + 2004 = 2009.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given the functional equation f(x) + f(1 - 1/x) = log|x|, we substitute x, y = 1 - 1/x, and z = 1/(1 - x) to form a system of equations. Solving this system yields f(x) = log|x/(x - 1)|. For x = 2007, f(2007) = log(2007/2006).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2009\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"log(2007/2006)\"\n}",
