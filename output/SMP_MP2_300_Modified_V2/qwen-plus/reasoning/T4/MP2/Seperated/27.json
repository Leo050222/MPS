As usual, $\\phi(n)$ is the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ and relatively prime to $n.$ Instead of determining the largest integer satisfying the totient divisibility and the specified summatory condition, simply find $e = k - 1990$, where $k$ is the exponent of the base-2 representation of that largest integer derived from the divisor count equaling the value of the sum."

Numbers $n$ with $\\\\phi(n) \\\\mid n$ are powers of 2 or products of powers of 2 and 3. The largest $n$ with $d(n) = 1992$ is $2^{1991}$ (since $d(2^{1991}) = 1992$). The exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is 1991, so $k = 1991$ and $e = k - 1990 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let $d = |x - y|$ and $t = d + 1$. Substituting $x = y + d$ into the equation leads to $y^2 + dy + 7d^2 = t^3$. Solving for integer solutions, valid pairs are found when $t = m^2 + m + 1$ for $m \\\\geq 0$. The positive integer solutions are $(1, 1)$, $(7, 13)$, $(13, 7)$, $(29, 41)$, $(41, 29)$, etc. However, only the smallest valid pairs are typically expected in such problems.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(1,1),(7,13),(13,7),(29,41),(41,29)\"\n}",
