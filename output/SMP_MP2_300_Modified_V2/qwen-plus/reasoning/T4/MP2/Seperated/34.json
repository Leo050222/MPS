Setting $ x = -y^2 $ gives $ f(0) = f(-y^2) + |y f(y)| $, so $ f(-y^2) = c - |y f(y)| $. For $ y = 1 $, $ f(1) = c + |f(1)| $. If $ f(1) \\\\geq 0 $, then $ c = 0 $. If $ f(1) < 0 $, contradictions arise (e.g., $ f(4) = 2d $ and $ f(4) = -2d $ for $ d < 0 $). Thus, $ c = 0 $. All solutions are $ f(x) = mx $ with $ m \\\\geq 0 $, so $ f(0) = 0 $. Hence, $ k = 0 + 4 = 4 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize circles through 4 concyclic points from 7 points, note two circles intersect at most 2 points. Using combinatorial design theory, the complement of the Fano plane (a 2-(7,4,2) design) gives 7 circles, each with 4 points, pairwise intersecting in 2 points. This configuration is geometrically realizable, and no more circles are possible due to intersection constraints and pair counting. Thus, the maximum number of circles is 7.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}",
