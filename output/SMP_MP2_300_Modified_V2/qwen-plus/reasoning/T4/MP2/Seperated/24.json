Checking the condition a₁ ≤ 2a₂:\\n- (1,2): 1 ≤ 2*2 = 4 ✔️\\n- (2,1): 2 ≤ 2*1 = 2 ✔️\\nBoth permutations satisfy the condition, so f(2)=2. Thus, k = f(2)-1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The equation is 2(x+y+z+2xyz)² = (2xy+2yz+2zx+1)² + 2023. Testing small positive integers, we find that triples where two variables are 3 and one is 2 satisfy the equation. For example, (2,3,3):\\n- Left: 2(2+3+3 + 2*2*3*3)² = 2(44)² = 3872\\n- Right: (2*2*3 + 2*3*3 + 2*3*2 + 1)² + 2023 = 43² + 2023 = 3872\\nAll permutations of (2,3,3) work: (2,3,3), (3,2,3), (3,3,2). No other triples satisfy the equation after exhaustive checking of small values and analyzing the Diophantine structure.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(2,3,3),(3,2,3),(3,3,2)\"\n}",
