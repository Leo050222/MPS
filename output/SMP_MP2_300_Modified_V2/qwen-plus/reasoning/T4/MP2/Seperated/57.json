Instead of identifying all positive integer pairs that simultaneously divide the exponential expression depending on their absolute difference, simply find $k = f(1) - 11$, where $f(d) = 9^d + 3^d + 1$ is the expression that must be divisible by both integers when $d$ is their absolute difference."

Thus, $ k = f(1) - 11 = 13 - 11 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given $ a + b + c + d = 2 $ and $ ab + bc + cd + da + ac + bd = 0 $, we analyze symmetric cases. For maximum $ abcd $, setting two variables as $ \\\\frac{1 + \\\\sqrt{3}}{2} $ and two as $ \\\\frac{1 - \\\\sqrt{3}}{2} $ yields $ abcd = \\\\left( \\\\frac{-1}{2} \\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{1}{4} $. For minimum $ abcd $, setting three variables to 1 and one to -1 satisfies the constraints and gives $ abcd = -1 $. These are confirmed as the extrema through symmetry and critical point analysis.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-1, 1/4\"\n}",
