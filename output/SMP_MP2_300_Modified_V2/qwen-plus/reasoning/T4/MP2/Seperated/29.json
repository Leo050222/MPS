Instead of finding all pairs $(a, b)$ of real numbers such that for each $n$, $a f_n + b f_{n+1}$ is a member of the sequence, simply find $k = f_0 + 1$, where $f_0$ is the preceding term in the Fibonacci sequence derived from the recurrence relation $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ applied at $n=2$."

Thus, k = f₀ + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The equation x²(1 + x²) = -1 + 21ʸ simplifies to x⁴ + x² + 1 = 21ʸ. Testing small integer values:\\n- For y = 0: 21⁰ = 1 ⇒ x⁴ + x² + 1 = 1 ⇒ x = 0. Solution: (0, 0).\\n- For y = 1: 21¹ = 21 ⇒ x⁴ + x² = 20 ⇒ x = ±2. Solutions: (±2, 1).\\n- For y ≥ 2: No integer solutions as 21ʸ grows faster than x⁴ + x² + 1.\\n- Negative y: RHS becomes negative, but LHS is non-negative, so no solutions.\\nThus, all integer solutions are (0, 0), (2, 1), (-2, 1).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(0, 0), (2, 1), (-2, 1)\"\n}",
