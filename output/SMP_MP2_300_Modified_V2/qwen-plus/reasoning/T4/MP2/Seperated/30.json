On the second day two medals and $\\frac{1}{7}$ of the remaining medals were awarded, and so on. On the last day, the remaining $n$ medals were awarded. How many medals did the meeting last, and what was the total number of medals ? Instead of determining the duration of the meeting and the total number of medals awarded, simply find $\\delta = c - 35$, where $c$ is the constant term in the particular solution of the recurrence relation for the number of remaining medals derived from the awarding process."
