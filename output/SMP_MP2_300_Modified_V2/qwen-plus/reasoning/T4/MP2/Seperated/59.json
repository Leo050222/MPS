The smallest non-trivial case occurs when ab + 1 = 3! = 6 (e.g., a=1, b=5), leading to bc + 1 = 6 = 3! (with c=1). Here, y = 3, so k = y - 1 = 2. While trivial cases like (1,1,1) give k=1, the problem likely targets the minimal non-trivial solution where bc + 1 is not 2!, which is standard in such problems.\\n\\nProblem 2: We seek n > 1 where (2^n + 1)/n² is integer. Testing small n shows n=3 works. Using modular arithmetic and LTE, we prove n must be a power of 3. For n=3^k, LTE gives v_3(2^{3^k} + 1) = k + 1. Requiring v_3(n²) = 2k ≤ k + 1 implies k=1. Checking other primes shows no solutions, so n=3 is the only answer.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
