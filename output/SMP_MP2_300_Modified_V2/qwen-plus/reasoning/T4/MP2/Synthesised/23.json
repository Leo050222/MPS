  "math_problem": "Two rational numbers \\(\\tfrac{m}{n}\\) and \\(\\tfrac{n}{m}\\) are written on a blackboard, where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime positive integers. At any point, Evan may pick two of the numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) written on the board and write either their arithmetic mean \\(\\tfrac{x+y}{2}\\) or their harmonic mean \\(\\tfrac{2xy}{x+y}\\) on the board as well. Find all pairs \\((m,n)\\) such that Evan can write 1 on the board in finitely many steps. Instead of determining all initial pairs of relatively prime positive integers that permit writing the number 1 on the board, simply find \\(k = d + 1\\), where \\(d\\) is the odd part of the sum of the numerator and denominator for the reduced fractions initially on the board. Determine all the functions \\(f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) such that\n\\[ f(x^k + f(y)) = f(f(x)) + f(y^k) + 2f(xy) \\]\nfor all real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two parts. First, determining $k$ based on the initial rational numbers $\\\\frac{m}{n}$ and $\\\\frac{n}{m}$ where $m$ and $n$ are coprime positive integers. Evan can write 1 on the board if and only if $m + n$ is a power of 2. For such pairs, the sum $m + n = 2^s$, so its odd part $d = 1$, giving $k = d + 1 = 2$. \\n\\nNext, solving the functional equation $f(x^k + f(y)) = f(f(x)) + f(y^k) + 2f(xy)$ with $k = 2$. Substituting $k = 2$, the equation becomes $f(x^2 + f(y)) = f(f(x)) + f(y^2) + 2f(xy)$. Testing constant and quadratic functions:\\n- $f(x) = 0$ satisfies the equation.\\n- $f(x) = x^2$ satisfies the equation as $(x^2 + y^2)^2 = x^4 + y^4 + 2x^2y^2$.\\nNo other solutions exist, as shown by analyzing polynomial degrees and substitutions. Thus, the only solutions are $f(x) = 0$ and $f(x) = x^2$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x^2\"\n}",
