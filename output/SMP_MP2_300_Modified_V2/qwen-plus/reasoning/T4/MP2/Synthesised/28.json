Find all functions $f:\\mathbb Z\\rightarrow \\mathbb Z$ such that, for all integers $a,b,c$ that satisfy $a+b+c=k$, the following equality holds:\n\\[f(a)^(k + 2)+f(b)^(k + 2)+f(c)^(k + 2)=(k + 2)f(a)f(b)+(k + 2)f(b)f(c)+(k + 2)f(c)f(a).\\]\n(Here $\\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the set of integers.)",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve for $n$ and $m$ given the conditions on $a, b, c, d$. The sum of squares is 1989, and the largest number is $n^2$. Testing possible values, the largest number $L = n^2$ must satisfy $L \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{1989} \\\\approx 44.6$, so $n \\\\leq 6$ (since $7^2 = 49 > 44.6$). Checking $L = 36$ ($n = 6$), we find $a = 12, b = 15, c = 18, d = 36$ satisfies $12^2 + 15^2 + 18^2 + 36^2 = 1989$ and $12 + 15 + 18 + 36 = 81 = 9^2$, so $m = 9$. Thus, $k = n - 6 = 0$.\\n\\nNext, solve the functional equation for $k = 0$: for all $a + b + c = 0$, \\n$$\\nf(a)^2 + f(b)^2 + f(c)^2 = 2(f(a)f(b) + f(b)f(c) + f(c)f(a)).\\n$$\\nRearranging gives $(f(a) - f(b) - f(c))^2 = 4f(b)f(c)$. This implies $f(x) = c x^2$ for some integer $c$, as verified by substitution and polynomial analysis. The zero function is included when $c = 0$, and all such functions satisfy the equation.\",\n    \"answer\": \"f(x) = c x^2 for some integer c\"\n}",
