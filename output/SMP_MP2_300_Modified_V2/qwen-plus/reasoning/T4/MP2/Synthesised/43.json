Find all possible values of $x$. Instead of determining all possible real roots of the quartic equation with coefficients given by the side lengths, simply find $k = b + 2013$, where $b$ is the length of side $CA$. Find the numbers of ordered array $(x_1,...,x_{100})$ that satisfies the following conditions: $(i)$ $x_1,...,x_{100} \\in \\{1,2,..,k\\}$; $(ii)$ $k | x_1 + \\dots + x_{100}$; $(iii)$ $k | x_1^2 + \\dots + x_{100}^2$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves a triangle $ABC$ inscribed in a circle of radius 2 with $\\\\angle ABC \\\\geq 90^\\\\circ$. The side lengths are related to the circumradius via the Law of Sines: $a = BC = 4 \\\\sin A$, $b = CA = 4 \\\\sin B$, $c = AB = 4 \\\\sin C$. For $\\\\angle ABC \\\\geq 90^\\\\circ$, $B \\\\in [90^\\\\circ, 180^\\\\circ)$, so $\\\\sin B \\\\leq 1$, implying $b \\\\leq 4$. The maximum value of $b$ occurs when $B = 90^\\\\circ$, making $CA$ the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, hence $CA = 2 \\\\times 2 = 4$ (diameter of the circumscribed circle). Thus, $b = 4$ is the only valid value for $b$ that satisfies the geometric constraints.\\n\\nGiven $k = b + 2013 = 4 + 2013 = 2017$, we need to count the number of ordered arrays $(x_1, \\\\dots, x_{100})$ where each $x_i \\\\in \\\\{1, 2, \\\\dots, 2017\\\\}$, such that $2017$ divides both the sum $x_1 + \\\\dots + x_{100}$ and the sum of squares $x_1^2 + \\\\dots + x_{100}^2$.\\n\\nSince $2017$ is prime, the problem reduces to counting solutions to two congruences modulo $2017$ in the finite field $\\\\mathbb{Z}/2017\\\\mathbb{Z}$. For a prime $k$ and $n \\\\geq 2$, the number of $n$-tuples satisfying $\\\\sum x_i \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod k$ and $\\\\sum x_i^2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod k$ is $k^{n-2}$. Here, $n = 100$, so the number of solutions is $2017^{98}$.\", \"answer\": \"2017^98\"}",
