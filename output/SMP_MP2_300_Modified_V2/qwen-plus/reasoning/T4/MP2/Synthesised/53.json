Instead of determining the polynomial's value at the point immediately following the last given evaluation point, simply find $q = Q(-1)$, where $Q(x)$ is the auxiliary polynomial of degree $n+1$ defined by $Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x$. Let $z$ be a complex number. In the complex plane, the distance from $z$ to $q$ is $(q + 1)$ , and the distance from $z^{2}$ to $q$ is $(q + 5)$ . What is the real part of $z$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, define the auxiliary polynomial $ Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x $. Since $ P(k) = \\\\frac{k}{k+1} $ for $ k = 0, 1, \\\\ldots, n $, we find $ Q(k) = 0 $ for these $ k $, so $ Q(x) $ has roots at $ 0, 1, \\\\ldots, n $. As $ Q(x) $ is degree $ n+1 $, it can be written as $ Q(x) = c x(x-1)\\\\cdots(x-n) $. Evaluating $ Q(-1) $ directly: $ Q(-1) = (-1+1)P(-1) - (-1) = 1 $, so $ q = Q(-1) = 1 $. \\n\\nNext, given $ |z - q| = q + 1 $ and $ |z^2 - q| = q + 5 $, substitute $ q = 1 $: $ |z - 1| = 2 $ and $ |z^2 - 1| = 6 $. Using $ |z^2 - 1| = |z - 1||z + 1| $, we get $ 2|z + 1| = 6 \\\\implies |z + 1| = 3 $. \\n\\nLet $ z = a + bi $. Then $ (a - 1)^2 + b^2 = 4 $ and $ (a + 1)^2 + b^2 = 9 $. Subtracting these equations: $ 4a = 5 \\\\implies a = \\\\frac{5}{4} $. Thus, the real part of $ z $ is $ \\\\frac{5}{4} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5/4\"\n}",
