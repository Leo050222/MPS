  "math_problem": "Determine all composite positive integers $n$ for which it is possible to arrange all divisors of $n$ that are greater than 1 in a circle so that no two adjacent divisors are relatively prime. Instead of determining all composite positive integers $n$ for which such a circular arrangement exists, simply find $k = \\gcd(p, q) + 1$, where $p$ and $q$ are the distinct prime factors of $n$ in the case where the set of divisors of $n$ greater than 1 has exactly three elements. Let $\\mathbb{N}$ denote the set of positive integers. Find all functions $f : \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that for positive integers $a$ and $b,$ \n\\[f(a^k + b^k) = f(a)f(b) \\text{ and } f(a^k) = f(a)^k.\\]",

Numbers with exactly four divisors are either $p^3$ (where $p$ is prime) or $pq$ (where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes). \\n\\n- For $n = p^3$, the divisors greater than 1 are $p, p^2, p^3$. However, this case has only one distinct prime factor ($p$), so it does not involve two distinct primes $p$ and $q$.\\n- For $n = pq$ (distinct primes $p$ and $q$), the divisors greater than 1 are $p, q, pq$, which are exactly three elements. Here, $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, so $\\\\gcd(p, q) = 1$.\\n\\nThus, $k = \\\\gcd(p, q) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2\"\n}",
