  "math_problem": "Given $30$ students such that each student has at most $5$ friends and for every $5$ students there is a pair of students that are not friends, determine the maximum $k$ such that for all such possible configurations, there exists $k$ students who are all not friends. Instead of determining the maximum such $k$, simply find $d = \\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) + 1644$, where $\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6)$ is the maximum number of edges in a graph on $30$ vertices with no clique of $6$ vertices derived from the extremal analysis of the complement of the friendship graph. How many real numbers $x$ are solutions to the following equation? $$(d - 1)^{x}+d^{x}=(d + 1)^{x}$$",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the definition of $ d = \\\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) + 1644 $. The term $ \\\\mathrm{ex}(n, K_r) $ refers to the Turán number, which gives the maximum number of edges in an $ n $-vertex graph that does not contain a complete subgraph $ K_r $. For $ \\\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) $, this corresponds to the maximum number of edges in a graph on 30 vertices with no clique of size 6.\\n\\nAccording to Turán's theorem, the extremal graph for avoiding $ K_6 $ is the complete 5-partite graph $ T(30, 5) $, where each partition has exactly 6 vertices (since $ 30 \\\\div 5 = 6 $). The number of edges in such a graph is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Edges} = \\\\binom{5}{2} \\\\cdot 6 \\\\cdot 6 = 10 \\\\cdot 36 = 360\\n$$\\n\\nThus, $ \\\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) = 360 $, and so:\\n\\n$$\\nd = 360 + 1644 = 2004\\n$$\\n\\nNext, we analyze the equation:\\n\\n$$\\n(d - 1)^x + d^x = (d + 1)^x\\n$$\\n\\nSubstituting $ d = 2004 $, the equation becomes:\\n\\n$$\\n2003^x + 2004^x = 2005^x\\n$$\\n\\nWe define the function:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x) = 2005^x - 2004^x - 2003^x\\n$$\\n\\nWe are interested in the number of real solutions to $ f(x) = 0 $. To determine this, consider the behavior of $ f(x) $:\\n\\n- As $ x \\\\to -\\\\infty $: All terms decay exponentially, but $ 2005^x $ decays slower than $ 2004^x $ and $ 2003^x $, so $ f(x) < 0 $.\\n- At $ x = 0 $: $ f(0) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 < 0 $\\n- As $ x \\\\to \\\\infty $: $ 2005^x $ dominates, so $ f(x) > 0 $\\n\\nThe derivative of $ f(x) $ is:\\n\\n$$\\nf'(x) = \\\\ln(2005) \\\\cdot 2005^x - \\\\ln(2004) \\\\cdot 2004^x - \\\\ln(2003) \\\\cdot 2003^x\\n$$\\n\\nSince all logarithmic terms are positive and the exponential growth rates increase with base, $ f'(x) > 0 $ for all $ x $. Therefore, $ f(x) $ is strictly increasing.\\n\\nBecause $ f(x) $ is continuous, strictly increasing, and transitions from negative to positive as $ x $ increases, there is **exactly one** real solution to the equation.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
