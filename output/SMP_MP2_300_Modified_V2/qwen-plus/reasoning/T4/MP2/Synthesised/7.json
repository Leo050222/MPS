Let $A:=\\mathbb{Q}\\backslash\\{0,1\\}$ denote the set of all rationals other than 0 and 1.

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, identify all ordered triples of primes (p, q, r) satisfying the divisibility conditions. Testing small primes reveals three valid cyclic triples: (2, 5, 3), (5, 3, 2), and (3, 2, 5). Each triple satisfies:\\n- For (2, 5, 3): 2 | 5³ + 1 = 126, 5 | 3² + 1 = 10, 3 | 2⁵ + 1 = 33.\\n- For (5, 3, 2): 5 | 3² + 1 = 10, 3 | 2⁵ + 1 = 33, 2 | 5³ + 1 = 126.\\n- For (3, 2, 5): 3 | 2⁵ + 1 = 33, 2 | 5³ + 1 = 126, 5 | 3² + 1 = 10.\\n\\nThe problem specifies finding k = r + 2004 where r is the prime in the triple that divides p^q + 1 (i.e., the third element of the ordered triple). The possible values of r are 3, 2, and 5. However, the triple (3, 2, 5) has r = 5 as the largest prime, which is a standard solution in such problems where r is the prime factor of p^q + 1 (here, 5 divides 3² + 1 = 10). Thus, r = 5, so k = 5 + 2004 = 2009.\\n\\nNext, solve the functional equation f(x) + f(1 - 1/x) = log |x|. Using substitution and solving the system, we find f(x) = log(|x| / |x - 1|). For k = 2009 (which is in A = ℚ \\\\ {0, 1}), compute f(2009) = log(2009 / 2008).\",\n    \"answer\": \"log(2009/2008)\"\n}",
