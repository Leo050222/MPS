  "math_problem": "Find all integers $n$ satisfying $n \\\\geq 2$ and $\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(n)}{p(n)-1}=n$, in which $\\\\sigma(n)$ denotes the sum of all positive divisors of $n$, and $p(n)$ denotes the largest prime divisor of $n$. Instead of identifying all integers satisfying the condition relating the sum of divisors to the largest prime divisor, simply find $k$, the number of distinct prime factors shared by any such integer. Let $n$ be an integer of the form $a^{k}+b^{k}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)=k-1$ and if $p$ is a prime, $p \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{n}$, then $p$ divides $a b$. Determine all such $n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the equation $\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(n)}{p(n)-1} = n$ for $n \\\\geq 2$, where $\\\\sigma(n)$ is the sum of divisors and $p(n)$ is the largest prime divisor of $n$. Testing small values and analyzing the structure shows that $n = 6$ is the only solution. This $n$ has two distinct prime factors (2 and 3), so $k = 2$. Next, consider $n = a^k + b^k = a^2 + b^2$ with $\\\\gcd(a, b) = k - 1 = 1$ and all primes $p \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{n}$ dividing $ab$. Checking small values:\\n- $n = 2 = 1^2 + 1^2$: $\\\\gcd(1,1) = 1$, no primes $\\\\leq \\\\sqrt{2}$, valid.\\n- $n = 5 = 1^2 + 2^2$: primes $\\\\leq \\\\sqrt{5}$ is 2, which divides $ab = 2$, valid.\\n- $n = 13 = 2^2 + 3^2$: primes $\\\\leq \\\\sqrt{13}$ are 2, 3, both divide $ab = 6$, valid.\\nLarger $n$ fail because primes $\\\\leq \\\\sqrt{n}$ exceed the factors of $ab$. Thus, the valid $n$ are 2, 5, 13.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2,5,13\"\n}",
