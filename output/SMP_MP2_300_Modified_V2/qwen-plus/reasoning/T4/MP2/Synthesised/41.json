  "math_problem": "Two players, $B$ and $R$ , play the following game on an infinite grid of unit squares, all initially colored white. The players take turns starting with $B$ . On $B$ 's turn, $B$ selects one white unit square and colors it blue. On $R$ 's turn, $R$ selects two white unit squares and colors them red. The players alternate until $B$ decides to end the game. At this point, $B$ gets a score, given by the number of unit squares in the largest (in terms of area) simple polygon containing only blue unit squares. What is the largest score $B$ can guarantee?\n(A simple polygon is a polygon (not necessarily convex) that does not intersect itself and has no holes.) Instead of determining the largest score $B$ can guarantee, simply find $m = |P_i| - 2$, where $|P_i|$ is the number of unit squares in each of the disjoint $2 \\times 2$ blocks into which the grid is partitioned to analyze the connectivity of blue squares. Find all $x,y$ and $z$ in positive integers: $z + y^{m} + x^{3} = xyz$ and $x = \\gcd(y,z)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ m $. The grid is partitioned into disjoint $ 2 \\\\times 2 $ blocks, each containing 4 unit squares. Thus, $ |P_i| = 4 $, so $ m = |P_i| - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 $. The equation becomes $ z + y^2 + x^3 = xyz $ with $ x = \\\\gcd(y, z) $. \\n\\nLet $ x = d $, $ y = da $, $ z = db $ where $ \\\\gcd(a, b) = 1 $. Substituting gives $ db + d^2a^2 + d^3 = d^3ab $, simplifying to $ b + da^2 + d^2 = d^2ab $. Rearranged: $ b = \\\\frac{d(a^2 + d)}{d^2a - 1} $. \\n\\nFor $ d = 1 $: $ b = \\\\frac{a^2 + 1}{a - 1} $. $ a - 1 $ divides 2, so $ a = 2, 3 $. Solutions: $ (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 5) $. \\n\\nFor $ d = 2 $: $ b = \\\\frac{2a^2 + 4}{4a - 1} $. $ 4a - 1 $ divides 33, so $ a = 1, 3 $. Solutions: $ (x, y, z) = (2, 2, 4), (2, 6, 4) $. \\n\\nHigher $ d $ values yield no integer solutions. All solutions satisfy $ x = \\\\gcd(y, z) $ and the equation.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(1,2,5), (1,3,5), (2,2,4), (2,6,4)\"\n}",
