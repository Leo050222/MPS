Instead of finding all pairs $(a, b)$ of real numbers such that for each $n$, $a f_n + b f_{n+1}$ is a member of the sequence, simply find $k = f_0 + 1$, where $f_0$ is the preceding term in the Fibonacci sequence derived from the recurrence relation $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ applied at $n=2$. Solve in $ \\mathbb{Z}^2 $ the equation: $ x^2\\left( 1+x^2 \\right) =-k+21^y. $",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $k = f_0 + 1$. The Fibonacci sequence starts as $\\\\{1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\\\dots\\\\}$, so $f_1 = 1$, $f_2 = 1$. Using the recurrence $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ at $n=2$, we get $f_2 = f_1 + f_0 \\\\implies 1 = 1 + f_0 \\\\implies f_0 = 0$. Thus, $k = 0 + 1 = 1$. The equation becomes $x^2(1 + x^2) = -1 + 21^y$. Rearranging gives $x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 21^y$. Testing integer values:\\n- For $x = 0$: $0 + 0 + 1 = 1 = 21^0 \\\\implies y = 0$, so $(0, 0)$ is a solution.\\n- For $x = \\\\pm 2$: $16 + 4 + 1 = 21 = 21^1 \\\\implies y = 1$, so $(\\\\pm 2, 1)$ are solutions.\\n- Other values of $x$ (e.g., $\\\\pm 1, \\\\pm 3, \\\\dots$) do not yield powers of 21. Negative $y$ values make $21^y$ fractional, leading to negative RHS, which cannot equal the non-negative LHS. Thus, the only integer solutions are $(0, 0)$, $(2, 1)$, and $(-2, 1)$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(0, 0), (2, 1), (-2, 1)\"\n}",
