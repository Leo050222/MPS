Instead of finding all positive integers $a, b, c$ such that $ab + 1$, $bc + 1$, and $ca + 1$ are all factorials of positive integers, simply find $k = y - 1$, where $y$ is the positive integer such that $bc + 1 = y!$ in any such triple $(a, b, c)$.

The only valid triples $(a, b, c)$ satisfying this are permutations of $(1, 1, m! - 1)$ for $ m \\\\geq 2 $. In such triples, $ bc + 1 = m! $, so $ y = m $ and $ k = y - 1 = m - 1 $. However, the problem specifies finding $ k $ such that there exist integers $ n > k $ with $ \\\\frac{2^n + k}{n^2} $ being an integer.\\n\\nTesting small values:\\n- For $ k = 1 $ (from $ m = 2 $, triple $(1, 1, 1)$), check $ \\\\frac{2^n + 1}{n^2} $:\\n  - $ n = 3 $: $ \\\\frac{8 + 1}{9} = 1 $, which is an integer.\\n  - No other $ n > 1 $ satisfies the condition (verified via modular arithmetic and LTE lemma).\\n- For $ k \\\\geq 2 $, no $ n > k $ makes $ \\\\frac{2^n + k}{n^2} $ an integer.\\n\\nThus, $ k = 1 $ is the only valid value, and the only $ n > 1 $ is $ n = 3 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
