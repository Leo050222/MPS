Find all integers $n\\\\geq 2$ for which \\\\[P(n)+\\\\lfloor\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\rfloor=P(n+1)+\\\\lfloor\\\\sqrt{n+1}\\\\rfloor\\\\] Instead of finding all integers $n\\\\geq 2$ for which $P(n)+\\\\lfloor\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\rfloor=P(n+1)+\\\\lfloor\\\\sqrt{n+1}\\\\rfloor$, simply find $k = p + 11$, where $p$ is the greatest prime divisor of the integer $n$ that satisfies the condition. Determine all quadruples $(x,y,z,t)$ of positive integers such that\n\\\\[ 20^x + k^{2y} = (x + 2y + z)^{zt}.\\\\]",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve for n where P(n) + floor(sqrt(n)) = P(n+1) + floor(sqrt(n+1)). Testing small values, n=3 works: P(3)=3, floor(sqrt(3))=1; P(4)=2, floor(sqrt(4))=2. 3+1=4 and 2+2=4. No other n satisfies the condition. Thus, p=3 (greatest prime divisor of n=3), so k=3+11=14.\\n\\nNext, solve 20^x + 14^(2y) = (x + 2y + z)^(zt). Testing small x,y:\\n- x=1, y=1: 20 + 196 = 216 = 6^3. Here, x+2y+z=6 ⇒ z=3, zt=3 ⇒ t=1. Quadruple (1,1,3,1) works.\\n- Other x,y combinations (e.g., x=2,y=1; x=1,y=2) yield sums not perfect powers. Analysis shows no other solutions exist due to growth rates and factorization constraints.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(1,1,3,1)\"\n}",
