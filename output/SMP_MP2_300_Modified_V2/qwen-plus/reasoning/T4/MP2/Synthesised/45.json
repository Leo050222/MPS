  "math_problem": "Find the number of triples of sets $(A, B, C)$ such that: (a) $A, B, C \\subseteq\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 8\\}$. (b) $|A \\cap B|=|B \\cap C|=|C \\cap A|=2$. (c) $|A|=|B|=|C|=4$. Here, $|S|$ denotes the number of elements in the set $S$. Instead of determining the total number of such triples of sets, simply find $m = |A \\cap B \\cap C|$, where $|A \\cap B \\cap C|$ is the size of the triple intersection derived from the structural consideration of configurations with no elements belonging to exactly two of the sets. Compute the number of ways there are to assemble $m$ red unit cubes and $(m + 23)$ white unit cubes into a $(m + 1) \\times (m + 1) \\times (m + 1)$ cube such that red is visible on exactly 4 faces of the larger cube. (Rotations and reflections are considered distinct.)",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine $ m = |A \\\\cap B \\\\cap C| $ under the condition that no elements belong to exactly two of the sets $ A, B, C $. This implies that the regions corresponding to pairwise intersections (but not the triple intersection) are empty, i.e., $ p = q = r = 0 $. Given $ |A \\\\cap B| = |B \\\\cap C| = |C \\\\cap A| = 2 $, and since $ |A \\\\cap B| = p + m $, we find $ m = 2 $. \\n\\nNext, we compute the number of ways to assemble $ m = 2 $ red unit cubes and $ m + 23 = 25 $ white unit cubes into a $ (m + 1) \\\\times (m + 1) \\\\times (m + 1) = 3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 3 $ cube such that red is visible on exactly 4 faces. \\n\\nIn a $ 3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 3 $ cube:\\n- **Corners** (8 positions): each visible on 3 faces.\\n- **Edge centers** (12 positions): each visible on 2 faces.\\n- **Face centers** (6 positions): each visible on 1 face.\\n- **Inner cube** (1 position): visible on 0 faces.\\n\\nWe count pairs of positions where the union of visible faces has size exactly 4:\\n\\n1. **Two corners sharing an edge**: These share 2 faces, so their union covers $ 3 + 3 - 2 = 4 $ faces. There are 12 such pairs (one for each edge).\\n2. **One corner and one edge center sharing exactly 1 face**: Union size $ 3 + 2 - 1 = 4 $. Each corner has 6 such edge centers, giving $ 8 \\\\times 6 = 48 $ pairs.\\n3. **One corner and one face center on a non-corner face**: Union size $ 3 + 1 - 0 = 4 $. Each corner has 3 such face centers, giving $ 8 \\\\times 3 = 24 $ pairs.\\n4. **Two edge centers with disjoint face sets**: Union size $ 2 + 2 - 0 = 4 $.
