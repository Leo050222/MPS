  "math_problem": "A sequence of functions $\\\\{ f_n(x) \\\\} $ is defined recursively as follows: \\begin{align*} f_1(x) &= \\sqrt {x^2 + 48}, \\quad \\text{and} \\\\ f_{n + 1}(x) &= \\sqrt {x^2 + 6f_n(x)} \\quad \\text{for } n \\geq 1. \\end{align*} (Recall that $\\sqrt {\\makebox[5mm]{}}$ is understood to represent the positive square root .) For each positive integer $n$ , find all real solutions of the equation $ f_n(x) = 2x $ . Instead of finding all real solutions of the equation $f_n(x) = 2x$ for each positive integer $n$, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the constant satisfying $f_1(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 6k}$ derived from the given definition. One day, there is a Street Art Show at somewhere, and there are some spectators around. We consider this place as an Euclidean plane. Let $K$ be the center of the show. And name the spectators by $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}, \\ldots$ They pick their positions $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}, \\ldots$ one by one. The positions need to satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously. (i) The distance between $K$ and $A_{n}$ is no less than 10 meters, that is, $K P_{n} \\geq 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any positive integer $n$. (ii) The distance between $A_{n}$ and any previous spectator is no less than $(k - 7)$ meters, that is, $P_{m} P_{n} \\geq (k - 7) \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any $n \\geq 2$ and any $1 \\leq m \\leq n-1$. (iii) $A_{n}$ always choose the position closest to $K$ that satisfies (i) and (ii), that is, $K P_{n}$ reaches its minimum possible value. If there are more than one point that satisfy (i) and (ii) and have the minimum distance to $K, A_{n}$ may choose any one of them. For example, $A_{1}$ is not restricted by (ii), so he may choose any point on the circle $C$ which is centered at $K$ with radius $(k + 2)$ meters. For $A_{2}$, since there are lots of points on $C$ which are at least $(k - 7)$ meters apart from $P_{1}$, he may choose anyone of them. (1) Which of the following statement is true? (A) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2}$ always hold (unit: meter); (B) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\sqrt{n} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} \\sqrt{n}$ always hold (unit: meter); (C) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n$ always hold (unit: meter); (D) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n^{2} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n^{2}$ always hold (unit: meter).",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the value of $ k $. The problem states that $ f_1(x) = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 48} $, and we are to find $ k $ such that $ f_1(x) = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 6k} $. Equating the constants under the square root gives $ 6k = 48 $, so $ k = 8 $.\\n\\nNext, analyze the Street Art Show conditions. With $ k = 8 $, condition (ii) requires the distance between any two spectators to be at least $ k - 7 = 1 $ meter. Condition (i) mandates all spectators are at least 10 meters from $ K $. Condition (iii) specifies that each new spectator chooses the closest possible position to $ K $ satisfying (i) and (ii).\\n\\nFor large $ n $, the problem reduces to packing $ n $ points in the plane such that each is at least 1 meter apart and all are at least 10 meters from $ K $. The minimal enclosing radius $ R $ for $ n $ points with pairwise distances $ \\\\geq 1 $ grows proportionally to $ \\\\sqrt{n} $ due to area considerations: the area required is $ \\\\Theta(n) $, so $ R = \\\\Theta(\\\\sqrt{n}) $. Thus, $ KP_n $ scales as $ \\\\sqrt{n} $, matching option (B). Options (A), (C), and (D) are invalid because $ KP_n $ is unbounded (A), and linear/quadratic growth (C, D) is too fast compared to the area-based $ \\\\sqrt{n} $ scaling.\",\n    \"answer\": \"B\"\n}",
