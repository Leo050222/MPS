  "math_problem": "A polynomial $P$ of degree 2015 satisfies the equation $P(n)=\\frac{1}{n^{2}}$ for $n=1,2, \\ldots, 2016$. Find $\\lfloor 2017 P(2017)\\rfloor$. Instead of finding the floor of the product of the next successive integer and the value of $P$ evaluated at that integer, simply find $d = Q(0) + 5$, where $Q(x) = x^{2} P(x) - 1$ is the auxiliary polynomial derived from the given interpolation condition. In the polynomial $x^{d} - 18x^{3} + kx^{2} + 200x - 1984 = 0$, the product of $(d - 2)$ of its roots is $(d - 36)$. Find $k$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, define $ Q(x) = x^2 P(x) - 1 $. Since $ P $ is degree 2015, $ Q(x) $ is degree 2017. For $ n = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, 2016 $, $ Q(n) = 0 $, so $ Q(x) $ has roots at these points. Evaluating at $ x = 0 $, $ Q(0) = 0^2 P(0) - 1 = -1 $. Thus, $ d = Q(0) + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4 $.\\n\\nNext, consider the polynomial $ x^4 - 18x^3 + kx^2 + 200x - 1984 = 0 $ (since $ d = 4 $). Let the roots be $ r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4 $. Vieta's formulas give:\\n- Sum of roots: $ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 = 18 $\\n- Sum of products of roots two at a time: $ k $\\n- Sum of products three at a time: $ -200 $\\n- Product of roots: $ -1984 $\\n\\nGiven the product of $ d - 2 = 2 $ roots is $ d - 36 = -32 $, assume $ r_1 r_2 = -32 $. Let $ r_3 r_4 = D $. Then $ (-32)D = -1984 \\\\implies D = 62 $. Let $ A = r_1 + r_2 $, $ B = r_3 + r_4 $, so $ A + B = 18 $. The sum of products three at a time is $ r_1 r_2 (r_3 + r_4) + r_3 r_4 (r_1 + r_2) = -32B + 62A = -200 $. Substituting $ B = 18 - A $:\\n$$\\n-32(18 - A) + 62A = -200 \\\\implies 94A = 376 \\\\implies A = 4, \\\\, B = 14\\n$$\\nThe sum of products two at a time is:\\n$$\\nk = r_1 r_2 + r_3 r_4 + (r_1 + r_2)(r_3 + r_4) = -32 + 62 + (4)(14) = 86\\n$$\",\n    \"answer\": \"86\"\n}",
