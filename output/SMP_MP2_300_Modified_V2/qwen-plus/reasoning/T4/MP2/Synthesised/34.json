  "math_problem": "Determine all functions $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ such that for every pair of real numbers $x$ and $y$,  \n\\[f(x+y^2)=f(x)+|y f(y)|.\\] Instead of characterizing all functions satisfying the given functional equation, simply find $k = f(0) + 4$, where $f(0)$ is the value of the function at zero derived from analysis of the functional equation. There are arbitrary $(k + 3)$ points in the plane. Circles are drawn through every $k$ possible concyclic points. Find the maximum number of circles that can be drawn.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the functional equation $f(x + y^2) = f(x) + |y f(y)|$. Setting $x = 0$ gives $f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)|$. Setting $y = 0$ yields no new information. Setting $x = -y^2$ gives $f(0) = f(-y^2) + |y f(y)|$. Combining these, $f(-y^2) = 2f(0) - f(y^2)$. Assuming $f$ is linear ($f(x) = cx$), substituting into the equation shows $c \\\\geq 0$ works, and $f(0) = 0$ for all solutions. Thus, $k = f(0) + 4 = 4$.\\n\\nNext, with $k = 4$, we have $k + 3 = 7$ points. We need the maximum number of circles through every 4 concyclic points. A 2-(7,4,2) design (complement of the Fano plane) shows 7 circles, each with 4 points, where every pair of points lies on exactly 2 circles. This configuration is realizable in the plane, giving the maximum number of circles as 7.\",\n    \"answer\": \"7\"\n}",
