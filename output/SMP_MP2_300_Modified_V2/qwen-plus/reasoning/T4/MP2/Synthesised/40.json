Instead of determining all integers at least 2 such that no difference of the specified powered terms between distinct bases up to that integer is divisible by it, simply find $s = k - 1$, where $k$ is the smallest integer at least 2 for which at least one such difference between distinct bases up to $k$ is divisible by $k$. $(s + 2017)$ positive integers are written in one line. Each of them starting with the $s$-th is divisible by previous and by the sum of two previous numbers. What is the smallest value the last number can take?\n\nA. Gribalko",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the smallest integer $ k \\\\geq 2 $ such that there exist distinct positive integers $ m, n \\\\leq k $ with $ k \\\\mid n^{n-1} - m^{m-1} $. Checking small values:\\n- For $ k = 2 $: Only pair $ (1, 2) $, $ 2^1 - 1^0 = 1 $, not divisible by 2.\\n- For $ k = 3 $: Pairs $ (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) $ yield differences 1, 8, 7; none divisible by 3.\\n- For $ k = 4 $: Pair $ (1, 3) $ gives $ 3^2 - 1^0 = 8 $, which is divisible by 4. Thus, $ k = 4 $ is the smallest such integer.\\n\\nLet $ s = k - 1 = 3 $. The problem requires $ s + 2017 = 2020 $ positive integers where each term starting from the $ s $-th (i.e., the 3rd term) is divisible by the previous term and the sum of the two previous terms.\\n\\nConstructing the minimal sequence:\\n- Let $ a_1 = 1 $, $ a_2 = 1 $.\\n- $ a_3 $ must be divisible by $ a_2 = 1 $ and $ a_1 + a_2 = 2 $, so $ a_3 = 2 $.\\n- $ a_4 $ must be divisible by $ a_3 = 2 $ and $ a_2 + a_3 = 3 $, so $ a_4 = 6 $.\\n- Continuing this pattern, each term $ a_n = (n-1)! $ satisfies the divisibility conditions:\\n  - $ a_i $ is divisible by $ a_{i-1} = (i-2)! $ since $ (i-1)! / (i-2)! = i-1 $.\\n  - $ a_i $ is divisible by $ a_{i-2} + a_{i-1} = (i-3)! + (i-2)! = (i-3)!(i-1) $ since $ (i-1)! / [(i-3)!(i-1)] = i-2 $.\\n\\nThus, the sequence $ a_n = (n-1)! $ is minimal. For $ n = 2020 $, the last term is $ a_{2020} = 2019! $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2019!\"\n}",
