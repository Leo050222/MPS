Let $f(x)=x^{3}+x+1$. Suppose $g$ is a cubic polynomial such that $g(0)=-1$, and the roots of $g$ are the squares of the roots of $f$. Find $g(k)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main parts. First, determining $ k = a_2 + 4 $, where $ a_2 $ is the number of valid function assignments up to the second level of the preimage tree under the squaring map modulo 17 rooted at 1, given two valid choices at the first preimage level. Second, computing $ g(k) $ for a cubic polynomial $ g $ whose roots are the squares of the roots of $ f(x) = x^3 + x + 1 $, with $ g(0) = -1 $.\\n\\n**Part 1: Finding $ k $**\\n\\n- The squaring map modulo 17 (a prime) forms a cyclic group of order 16 for non-zero elements. The preimage tree rooted at 1:\\n  - Level 0: {1} (root).\\n  - Level 1: Preimages of 1 under squaring: $ x^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 17 $, solutions $ x = 1, 16 $. Excluding the root, Level 1 has one distinct node: {16}.\\n  - Level 2: Preimages of 16 under squaring: $ x^2 \\\\equiv 16 \\\\mod 17 $, solutions $ x = 4, 13 $.\\n\\n- Functional equation constraints:\\n  - For Level 0 (root $ x = 1 $): $ f(1) = f(1)^2 + 15 \\\\mod 17 $, yielding two valid values for $ f(1) $: 2 and 16.\\n  - For Level 1 ($ x = 16 $): $ f(1) = f(16)^2 + 15 \\\\mod 17 $. For each valid $ f(1) $, there are two valid choices for $ f(16) $.\\n  - For Level 2 ($ x = 4, 13 $): $ f(16) = f(4)^2 + 15 $ and $ f(16) = f(13)^2 + 15 $. In the generic case where $ f(16) - 15 $ is a non-zero quadratic residue (ensuring two solutions per equation), each of the two Level 2 nodes has two valid choices.\\n\\n- Given the problem specifies \\\"in the case where there are two valid choices for the value at the first preimage level,\\\" we consider the scenario where Level 2 assignments are valid and each Level 2 node has two choices. Thus, $ a_2 = 2 \\\\times 2 = 4 $ (two nodes, two choices each).\\n\\n- Therefore, $ k = a_2 + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8 $.\\n\\n**Part 2: Computing $ g(k) $**\\n\\n- Let $ f(x) = x^3 + x + 1 $ with roots $ \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma $. The polynomial $ g(x) $ has roots $ \\\\alpha^2, \\\\beta^2, \\\\gamma^2 $.\\n\\n- Using Vieta's formulas for $ f(x) $:\\n  - $ \\\\alpha + \\\\beta + \\\\gamma = 0 $,\\n  - $ \\\\alpha\\\\beta + \\\\alpha\\\\gamma + \\\\beta\\\\gamma = 1 $,\\n  - $ \\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma = -1 $.\\n\\n- Compute symmetric sums for $ g(x) $:\\n  - Sum of roots: $ \\\\alpha^2 + \\\\beta^2 + \\\\gamma^2 = (\\\\alpha + \\\\beta + \\\\gamma)^2 - 2(\\\\alpha\\\\beta + \\\\alpha\\\\gamma + \\\\beta\\\\gamma) = -2 $.\\n  - Sum of products: $ \\\\alpha^2\\\\beta^2 + \\\\alpha^2\\\\gamma^2 + \\\\beta^2\\\\gamma^2 = (\\\\alpha\\\\beta + \\\\alpha\\\\gamma + \\\\beta\\\\gamma)^2 - 2\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma(\\\\alpha + \\\\beta + \\\\gamma) = 1 $.\\n  - Product of roots: $ (\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma)^2 = 1 $.\\n\\n- Thus, $ g(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + x - 1 $ (monic polynomial with $ g(0) = -1 $).\\n\\n- Evaluate $ g(8) $:\\n  $$\\n  g(8) = 8^3 + 2 \\\\cdot 8^2 + 8 - 1 = 512 + 128 + 8 - 1 = 647.\\n  $$\", \"answer\": \"647\"}",
