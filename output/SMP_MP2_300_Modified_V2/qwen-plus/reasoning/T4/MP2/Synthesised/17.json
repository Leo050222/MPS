Instead of determining the extrapolated value of the interpolating polynomial at the next successive integer, simply find $q_val$, where $q_val$ is the value at $x=-1$ of the expression $(x+1)P(x) - x$ with $P(x)$ the polynomial satisfying the given interpolation conditions. A sequence of real numbers $a_0, a_1, . . .$ is said to be good if the following three conditions hold.\n(i) The value of $a_0$ is a positive integer.\n(ii) For each non-negative integer $i$ we have $a_{i+1} = 2a_i + 1 $ or $a_{i+1} =\\frac{a_i}{a_i + 2} $\n(iii) There exists a positive integer $k$ such that $a_k = q_val + 2013$.\n\nFind the smallest positive integer $n$ such that there exists a good sequence $a_0, a_1, . . .$ of real numbers with the property that $a_n = q_val + 2013$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the polynomial interpolation condition. Given that $ P(k) = \\\\frac{k}{k+1} $ for $ k = 0, 1, \\\\ldots, n $, and $ P(x) $ is a polynomial of degree $ n $, we define:\\n\\n$$\\nQ(x) = (x + 1)P(x) - x\\n$$\\n\\nThis expression has roots at $ x = 0, 1, \\\\ldots, n $, so it must be of the form:\\n\\n$$\\nQ(x) = c \\\\cdot x(x - 1)(x - 2)\\\\cdots(x - n)\\n$$\\n\\nHowever, evaluating $ Q(-1) $ directly gives:\\n\\n$$\\nQ(-1) = (-1 + 1)P(-1) - (-1) = 0 + 1 = 1\\n$$\\n\\nThus, $ q_{\\\\text{val}} = Q(-1) = 1 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\nNext, we are told to find the smallest positive integer $ n $ such that there exists a **good sequence** $ a_0, a_1, \\\\ldots $ satisfying:\\n\\n- $ a_0 $ is a positive integer,\\n- Each $ a_{i+1} = 2a_i + 1 $ or $ a_{i+1} = \\\\frac{a_i}{a_i + 2} $,\\n- There exists some $ k $ such that $ a_k = q_{\\\\text{val}} + 2013 = 1 + 2013 = 2014 $.\\n\\nWe aim to find the **smallest positive integer $ n $** such that $ a_n = 2014 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Reverse Analysis\\n\\nLet’s consider the reverse process from $ a_n = 2014 $. Define the reverse operations:\\n\\n- If $ b > 1 $, then $ b $ could have come from $ a = \\\\frac{b - 1}{2} $\\n- If $ b < 1 $, then $ b $ could have come from $ a = \\\\frac{2b}{1 - b} $\\n\\nStarting from $ b = 2014 $, we apply these reverse operations repeatedly until we reach a **positive integer** $ a_0 $. The number of steps required to do this gives us the minimal $ n $ such that $ a_n = 2014 $.\\n\\nThrough detailed computation (as shown in the thought process), we trace the reverse path from 2014 through successive applications of the two reverse operations. This leads to a cycle where the sequence eventually returns to 2014 after **60 steps**.\\n\\nImportantly, **none of the intermediate values** in the reverse path from 2014 to the start are integers except for the initial value itself (i.e., $ a_0 = 2014 $). Therefore, the **first time** the sequence reaches 2014 again with a valid starting point $ a_0 $ being a positive integer is after **60 steps**.\\n\\nHence, the **smallest positive integer $ n $** such that $ a_n = 2014 $ is:\\n\\n$$\\nn = 60\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"60\"}",
