The distances from 1 are: $\\\\frac{11}{10} = 1.1$ (0.1), $\\\\frac{111}{100} = 1.11$ (0.11), 1.101 (0.101), $\\\\frac{1111}{1000} = 1.111$ (0.111), and 1.011 (0.011). The closest is 1.011. Convert 1.011 to a fraction with denominator 1000: $\\\\frac{1011}{1000}$. Here, $d = 1011$ (numerator). Compute $k = d + \\\\frac{748889}{1000} = 1011 + 748.889 = 1759.889$? Wait, no: $k = \\\\frac{1011}{1000} + \\\\frac{748889}{1000} = \\\\frac{1011 + 748889}{1000} = \\\\frac{749900}{1000} = 749.9$. Problem 2: The ratio of milk to flour is 50:250 = 1:5.
