There are $N$ lists $a, b, c, d, e$ with a mean of 2023 and a median of 2023, in which the integer 2023 appears more than once, and in which no other integer appears more than once.

Instead of computing the sum of the digits of the total number of such ordered quintuples, simply find $e = \\left(N - \\frac{21464546}{7}\\right)$, where $N$ is the total number of such ordered quintuples."
