If 10 of the smaller cubes are red, 9 are blue, and 8 are yellow, what is the smallest possible surface area of the larger cube that is red? Instead of determining the minimal total exposed face area contributed by the red small cubes on the surface of the assembled large cube, simply find $d = n + 20$, where $n$ is the number of red small cubes placed in positions exposing three faces in the assembly that achieves this minimum."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To minimize the red surface area, red cubes should occupy positions with the fewest exposed faces. The 3×3×3 cube has 1 center (0 faces), 6 face centers (1 face), 12 edges (2 faces), and 8 corners (3 faces). With 10 red cubes, the optimal placement is 1 in the center (0 exposure), 6 in face centers (6×1=6), and 3 on edges (3×2=6), totaling 12 exposed red faces. This uses no corner positions, so n=0. Thus, d = 0 + 20 = 20.\\n\\nProblem 2: Find LCM of 20, 16, and 2016. Prime factorizations: 20=2²×5, 16=2⁴, 2016=2⁵×3²×7. LCM takes highest exponents: 2⁵×3²×5×7=32×9×5×7=10080.
