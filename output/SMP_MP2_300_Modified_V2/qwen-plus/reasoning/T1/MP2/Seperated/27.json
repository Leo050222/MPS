      "A3193": "In her last basketball game, Jackie scored 36 points. These points raised the average number of points that she scored per game from 20 to 21. To raise this average to 22 points, how many points must Jackie score in her next game? Instead of determining the score required in the subsequent game to achieve the next targeted average, simply find $e = (total_after - 333)$, where $total_after$ is the cumulative points scored upon attaining the intermediate average following the recent game."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let n be the number of games before the last game. The total points before the last game were 20n. After scoring 36 points, the total became 20n + 36 over n + 1 games, with an average of 21. Solving (20n + 36)/(n + 1) = 21 gives n = 15. Total points after the last game: 21 * 16 = 336. The problem asks for e = total_after - 333, where total_after is the cumulative points after the recent game (which raised the average to 21). Thus, e = 336 - 333 = 3.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let x be the number of 3-point baskets. Then 10 - x is the number of 2-point baskets. The total points equation is 3x + 2(10 - x) = 26. Simplifying gives x + 20 = 26, so x = 6.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
