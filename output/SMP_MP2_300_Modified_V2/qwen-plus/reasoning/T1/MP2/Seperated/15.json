What would the same MP3 player sell for if it was on sale for $30 \\%$ off of its original price? Instead of computing the sale price under the alternative discount percentage, simply find $k = R - 128$, where $R$ is the original price of the MP3 player determined from the given sale price after the initial discount."

Then k = R - 128 = 140 - 128 = 12.\\n\\nProblem 2: The constant term of (x+m)(x+n) is mn = -12. For m to be valid, there must exist an integer n such that mn = -12. The integer divisors of -12 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±12. Any integer not in this set cannot be m. Common non-divisors like 5 cannot work (since -12/5 is not integer), so 5 is a value that cannot be m.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"12\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"5\"\n}",
