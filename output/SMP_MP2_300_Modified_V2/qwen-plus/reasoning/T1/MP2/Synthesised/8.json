  "math_problem": "A cube has an edge length of 30. A rectangular solid has edge lengths 20, 30, and $L$. If the cube and the rectangular solid have equal surface areas, what is the value of $L$? Instead of determining the third edge length of the rectangular solid, simply find $h = S - 5397$, where $S$ is the surface area of the cube. The line with equation $y = x$ is translated $h$ units to the right and $(h - 1)$ units down. What is the $y$-intercept of the resulting line?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, calculate the surface area of the cube with edge length 30. The surface area of a cube is $6 \\\\times \\\\text{edge length}^2$, so $6 \\\\times 30^2 = 6 \\\\times 900 = 5400$. Thus, $S = 5400$. Next, compute $h = S - 5397 = 5400 - 5397 = 3$. The line $y = x$ is translated $h = 3$ units to the right and $(h - 1) = 2$ units down. Translating right by 3 units replaces $x$ with $x - 3$, giving $y = (x - 3)$. Translating down by 2 units subtracts 2 from the equation, resulting in $y = (x - 3) - 2 = x - 5$. The $y$-intercept of $y = x - 5$ is $-5$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-5\"\n}",
