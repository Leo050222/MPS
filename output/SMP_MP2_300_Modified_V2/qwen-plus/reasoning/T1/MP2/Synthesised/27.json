  "math_problem": "In her last basketball game, Jackie scored 36 points. These points raised the average number of points that she scored per game from 20 to 21. To raise this average to 22 points, how many points must Jackie score in her next game? Instead of determining the score required in the subsequent game to achieve the next targeted average, simply find total_after, where total_after is the cumulative points scored upon attaining the intermediate average following the recent game. Lauren plays basketball with her friends. She makes 10 baskets. Each of these baskets is worth either 2 or (total_after - 333) points. Lauren scores a total of 26 points. How many (total_after - 333) point baskets did she make?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the number of games Jackie played before her last game. Let n be the number of games. Her total points before the last game were 20n. After scoring 36 points, her total became 20n + 36, and the average became 21 over n + 1 games. Solving (20n + 36)/(n + 1) = 21 gives n = 15. Thus, total_after = 20*15 + 36 = 336. For Lauren, each basket is worth 2 or (336 - 333) = 3 points. Let x be the number of 3-point baskets. The equation 2(10 - x) + 3x = 26 simplifies to x = 6.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
