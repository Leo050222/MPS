  "math_problem": "Anna thinks of an integer that is not a multiple of three, not a perfect square, and the sum of its digits is a prime number. What could the integer be? Instead of identifying an integer satisfying the conditions on multiples of three, perfect squares, and prime digit sums, simply find $k$ equal to the sum of the digits of such an integer plus 108. Ewan writes out a sequence where he counts by $(k - 102)$s starting at $(k - 110)$. Which number will appear in Ewan's sequence?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Anna's integer must not be a multiple of three, not a perfect square, and have a prime digit sum. Choosing 2 (digit sum 2, prime), k = 2 + 108 = 110. Ewan's sequence starts at k - 110 = 0 and steps by k - 102 = 8: 0, 8, 16, ..., 80. Alternatively, choosing 14 (digit sum 5, prime), k = 113, sequence starts at 3 stepping by 11: 3, 14, ..., 80. Both sequences include 80. Solving n(S + 6) - 8 = 80 shows 80 is valid for S=2 and S=5, confirming it appears in the sequence.\",\n    \"answer\": \"80\"\n}",
