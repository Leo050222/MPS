  "math_problem": "Consider positive integers $a \\leq b \\leq c \\leq d \\leq e$. There are $N$ lists $a, b, c, d, e$ with a mean of 2023 and a median of 2023, in which the integer 2023 appears more than once, and in which no other integer appears more than once. What is the sum of the digits of $N$? Instead of computing the sum of the digits of the total number of such ordered quintuples, simply find $N$, the total number of such ordered quintuples. In Rad's garden there are exactly 30 red roses, exactly 19 yellow roses, and no other roses. How many of the yellow roses does Rad need to remove so that $\\left(N - \\frac{21464546}{7}\\right)$ of the roses in the garden are yellow?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number $ N $ of ordered quintuples $ (a, b, c, d, e) $ satisfying the following conditions:\\n\\n- $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c \\\\leq d \\\\leq e $ are positive integers.\\n- The **mean** is 2023, so $ a + b + c + d + e = 5 \\\\times 2023 = 10115 $.\\n- The **median** is 2023, so $ c = 2023 $.\\n- The integer **2023 appears more than once**.\\n- No other integer appears more than once.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Understand the structure\\n\\nSince $ c = 2023 $, and the list is non-decreasing, the value 2023 must appear at least once in positions $ b, c, d $. To satisfy the condition that **2023 appears more than once**, it must appear in at least two of these positions.\\n\\nWe consider all valid configurations where 2023 appears **more than once**, while ensuring:\\n- All other numbers (not equal to 2023) are distinct.\\n- The sum $ a + b + c + d + e = 10115 $.\\n\\nLet’s analyze the possible cases based on how many times 2023 appears.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Case Analysis\\n\\n#### **Case A: 2023 appears exactly twice**\\n\\nThere are two subcases:\\n\\n- **Subcase A1**: $ b = c = 2023 $, $ d > 2023 $, $ e > d $\\n  - Then $ a < 2023 $, and $ a + d + e = 6069 $\\n  - Count the number of integer solutions with $ a < 2023 $, $ d > 2023 $, $ e > d $\\n  - This corresponds to counting pairs $ (d, e) $ such that $ d + e \\\\leq 6068 $, $ d > 2023 $, $ e > d $\\n  - Total: **1,021,110**\\n\\n- **Subcase A2**: $ c = d = 2023 $, $ b < 2023 $, $ a < b $\\n  - Then $ a + b + e = 6069 $, $ e > 2023 $\\n  - Count the number of integer pairs $ (a, b) $ such that $ a < b < 2023 $\\n  - Total: $ \\\\binom{2022}{2} = \\\\frac{2022 \\\\times 2021}{2} = 2,043,231 $\\n\\n**Total for Case A**: $ 1,021,110 + 2,043,231 = 3,064,341 $\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Case B: 2023 appears exactly three times**\\n\\nOnly one valid configuration:\\n\\n- $ b = c = d = 2023 $, $ a < 2023 $, $ e > 2023 $\\n  - Then $ a + e = 4046 $\\n  - $ a $ ranges from 1 to 2022 (since $ a < 2023 $)\\n  - Total: **2022**\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Case C: 2023 appears exactly five times**\\n\\n- All five values are 2023: $ (2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023) $\\n  - Valid since no other integers exist, so the \\\"no other integer appears more than once\\\" condition is vacuously true\\n  - Total: **1**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Summing Up\\n\\n$$\\nN = \\\\text{Case A} + \\\\text{Case B} + \\\\text{Case C} = 3,064,341 + 2022 + 1 = 3,066,364\\n$$\\n\\nThis is the total number of valid ordered quintuples.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Final Verification\\n\\nThe problem also includes a secondary question about Rad's garden, but the instruction explicitly says:\\n\\n> \\\"Instead of computing the sum of the digits of the total number of such ordered quintuples, simply find $ N $, the total number of such ordered quintuples.\\\"\\n\\nThus, the final answer is $ N = 3,066,364 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3066364\"\n}",
