  "math_problem": "Pablo has 27 solid $1 \\\\times 1 \\\\times 1$ cubes that he assembles in a larger $3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 3$ cube. If 10 of the smaller cubes are red, 9 are blue, and 8 are yellow, what is the smallest possible surface area of the larger cube that is red? Instead of determining the minimal total exposed face area contributed by the red small cubes on the surface of the assembled large cube, simply find $d = n + 20$, where $n$ is the number of red small cubes placed in positions exposing three faces in the assembly that achieves this minimum. What is the tens digit of the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of $d$, $(d - 4)$, and $(d + 1996)$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine the minimal red surface area by placing red cubes in positions with the fewest exposed faces. In a 3×3×3 cube, positions are categorized by exposed faces: 8 corners (3 faces), 12 edges (2 faces), 6 face centers (1 face), and 1 center (0 faces). To minimize red surface area, prioritize placing red cubes in the center (0 faces), then face centers (1 face), then edges (2 faces). With 10 red cubes: 1 in the center, 6 in face centers, and 3 in edges. This uses all 10 red cubes without any in corners, so n = 0 (number of red cubes in corner positions). Thus, d = n + 20 = 20.\\n\\nNext, find the smallest positive integer divisible by d = 20, d - 4 = 16, and d + 1996 = 2016. Compute LCM(20, 16, 2016):\\n- Prime factors: 20 = 2²×5, 16 = 2⁴, 2016 = 2⁵×3²×7.\\n- LCM takes highest powers: 2⁵×3²×5×7 = 32×9×5×7 = 10080.\\nThe tens digit of 10080 is 8.\",\n    \"answer\": \"8\"\n}",
