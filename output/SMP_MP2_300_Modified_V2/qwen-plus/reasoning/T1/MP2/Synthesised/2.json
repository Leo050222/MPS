  "math_problem": "Let $s(n)$ denote the number of 1's in the binary representation of $n$. Compute $$\\frac{1}{255} \\sum_{0 \\leq n<16} 2^{n}(-1)^{s(n)}$$ Instead of evaluating the provided expression, simply find $k = T + 46$, where $T = \\sum_{n=0}^{7} 2^{n} (-1)^{s(n)}$ is the alternating sum over the subrange of length 8. You plan to open your own Tmall.com store, called 'Store B,' selling the same headphones and speaker set at the same list prices as Store A does. Your store sells only these two models. You plan to issue 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupons, limited to one per order, where x is an integer greater than 0 and smaller than 99. (For example, the discount for an order of 250 RMB is x RMB, not 2x RMB). The Tmall.com '60 RMB off 299 RMB' coupon can be applied to purchases at store B and can be stacked with your 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupon. What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least $k$ RMB less on either the $(k + 249)$ RMB pair of the headphones or the $(k + 599)$ RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A? What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least $k$ RMB less for buying both the $(k + 249)$ RMB pair of the headphones and the $(k + 599)$ RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute T = \\u2211_{n=0}^7 2^n (-1)^{s(n)}, where s(n) is the number of 1's in the binary representation of n. Calculating each term:\\n- n=0 (000): 1 \\u00d7 1 = 1\\n- n=1 (001): 2 \\u00d7 (-1) = -2\\n- n=2 (010): 4 \\u00d7 (-1) = -4\\n- n=3 (011): 8 \\u00d7 1 = 8\\n- n=4 (100): 16 \\u00d7 (-1) = -16\\n- n=5 (101): 32 \\u00d7 1 = 32\\n- n=6 (110): 64 \\u00d7 1 = 64\\n- n=7 (111): 128 \\u00d7 (-1) = -128\\nSumming these: 1 - 2 - 4 + 8 - 16 + 32 + 64 - 128 = -45. Thus, T = -45 and k = T + 46 = 1.\\n\\nFor the coupon problem, k = 1. The headphones cost 250 RMB (k + 249) and speakers cost 600 RMB (k + 599). Store B's coupon gives x RMB off 99 RMB (one per order), and Tmall's coupon gives 60 RMB off 299 RMB, stackable.\\n\\n- **Headphones (250 RMB)**: Tmall coupon doesn't apply (250 < 299), so discount is x. Saving = x. Need x \\u2265 1 \\u21d2 minimal x = 1.\\n- **Speakers (600 RMB)**: Both coupons apply (600 \\u2265 299 and 99), saving = 60 + x \\u2265 1 (always true for x > 0).\\n\\nSince the question asks for the minimal x where saving \\u2265 k (1 RMB) on *either* item, x = 1 suffices (headphones saving exactly 1). For buying both items, the total saving is 60 + x, which also requires x = 1. However, the problem specifies finding the minimal x for the first condition (either item), which is 1.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
