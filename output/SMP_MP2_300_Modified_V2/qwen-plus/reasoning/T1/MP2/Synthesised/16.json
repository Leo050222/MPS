  "math_problem": "Consider the following flowchart: INPUT $\\rightarrow$ Subtract $8 \\rightarrow \\square \\rightarrow$ Divide by $2 \\rightarrow \\square$ Add $16 \\rightarrow$ OUTPUT. If the OUTPUT is 32, what was the INPUT? Instead of determining the initial input value that produces the specified output via the flowchart's sequence of operations, simply find $k = A - 26$, where $A$ is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step. What is the $y$-intercept of the line $y = x + (k - 2)$ after it is translated down $k$ units?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The flowchart steps are: INPUT → Subtract 8 (result is A) → Divide by 2 → Add 16 = OUTPUT (32). Starting from OUTPUT: (A / 2) + 16 = 32. Solving gives A / 2 = 16 → A = 32. Then k = A - 26 = 32 - 26 = 6. The line is y = x + (k - 2) = x + 4. Translating down k=6 units gives y = x + 4 - 6 = x - 2. The y-intercept is -2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-2\"\n}",
