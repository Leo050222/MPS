  "math_problem": "Which of the following numbers is closest to 1: $\\x0crac{11}{10}$, $\\x0crac{111}{100}$, 1.101, $\\x0crac{1111}{1000}$, 1.011? Instead of determining which of the given numbers is closest to 1, simply find $k = d + \\frac{748889}{1000}$, where $d$ is the value of the number in the list expressed as a fraction with denominator 1000. Luca mixes $(k - 700)$ mL of milk for every 250 mL of flour to make pizza dough. How much milk does he mix with $k$ mL of flour?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, identify the number closest to 1 from the list. The distances from 1 are: $\\\\frac{11}{10} = 0.1$, $\\\\frac{111}{100} = 0.11$, $1.101 = 0.101$, $\\\\frac{1111}{1000} = 0.111$, and $1.011 = 0.011$. The smallest distance is $0.011$, so $1.011$ is closest to 1. Expressing $1.011$ as a fraction with denominator 1000 gives $\\\\frac{1011}{1000}$, so $d = \\\\frac{1011}{1000}$. Compute $k = d + \\\\frac{748889}{1000} = \\\\frac{1011 + 748889}{1000} = \\\\frac{749900}{1000} = 749.9$. Luca mixes $(k - 700) = 49.9$ mL of milk per 250 mL of flour. To find the milk for $k = 749.9$ mL of flour, use the ratio: $\\\\frac{49.9}{250} \\\\times 749.9 = \\\\frac{49.9 \\\\times 749.9}{250} = \\\\frac{37420.01}{250} = 149.68004$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"149.68004\"\n}",
