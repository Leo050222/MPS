Instead of determining the numerical value of the given algebraic expression, simply find \\( k = v - 1 \\), where \\( v \\) is the quantity defined in terms of \\( x \\) as stated. The line with equation $y = 3x + k$ is translated $(k - 3)$ units to the right. What is the equation of the resulting line?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Given x = 2, compute v = 3x = 6. Then k = v - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5. The translation distance is k - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2 units to the right. Translating the line y = 3x + k (which is y = 3x + 5) 2 units right involves replacing x with (x - 2).
