  "math_problem": "An electric car is charged 3 times per week for 52 weeks. The cost to charge the car each time is $0.78. What is the total cost to charge the car over these 52 weeks? Instead of computing the overall expenditure, simply find $t_c$, the total number of charging sessions over the 52 weeks. If $4x + (t_c - 142) = 8x - 48$, what is the value of $2x$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, calculate the total number of charging sessions $ t_c $. The car is charged 3 times per week for 52 weeks, so $ t_c = 3 \\\\times 52 = 156 $. Next, substitute $ t_c = 156 $ into the equation $ 4x + (t_c - 142) = 8x - 48 $. This gives $ 4x + (156 - 142) = 8x - 48 $, simplifying to $ 4x + 14 = 8x - 48 $. Rearranging terms: $ 14 + 48 = 8x - 4x $, so $ 62 = 4x $. Solving for $ x $, we get $ x = \\\\frac{62}{4} = 15.5 $. Therefore, $ 2x = 31 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"31\"\n}",
