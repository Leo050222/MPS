  "math_problem": "The product of $N$ consecutive four-digit positive integers is divisible by $2010^{2}$. What is the least possible value of $N$? Instead of determining the smallest such $N$, simply find $e = v_5(\\ell) - 2$, where $\\ell$ is the largest four-digit multiple of $25$ that is less than $2 \\times 67^2$. The area of the triangular region bounded by the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis and the line with equation $y=2x-(e + 6)$ is one-quarter of the area of the triangular region bounded by the $x$-axis, the line with equation $y=2x-(e + 6)$ and the line with equation $x=d$, where $d>e$. What is the value of $d$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute $2 \\\\times 67^2$: $67^2 = 4489$, so $2 \\\\times 4489 = 8978$. The largest four-digit multiple of 25 less than 8978 is $8975$ (since $25 \\\\times 359 = 8975$). Factorizing $8975 = 5^2 \\\\times 359$, so $v_5(\\\\ell) = 2$. Thus, $e = 2 - 2 = 0$.\\n\\nNext, the line equation becomes $y = 2x - 6$. The triangular region bounded by the axes has vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(3, 0)$, and $(0, -6)$, with area $\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\times 3 \\\\times 6 = 9$.\\n\\nThe second triangular region is bounded by the $x$-axis, $y = 2x - 6$, and $x = d$. Its vertices are $(3, 0)$, $(d, 0)$, and $(d, 2d - 6)$. The area is $\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\times (d - 3) \\\\times (2d - 6) = (d - 3)^2$. Given $9 = \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\times (d - 3)^2$, solving gives $(d - 3)^2 = 36$, so $d = 9$ (since $d > 0$).\",\n    \"answer\": \"9\"\n}",
