  "math_problem": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$. Shuxin begins with $d$ red candies, $(d - 3)$ yellow candies, and $(d - 7)$ blue candies. After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining. What is the smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the scaling factor $ k $ for the ratio of skateboards to bicycles (7:4). Given there are 12 more skateboards than bicycles:\\n$$\\n7k - 4k = 12 \\\\implies 3k = 12 \\\\implies k = 4\\n$$\\nThus, $ d = k + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 $.\\n\\nShuxin starts with:\\n- Red candies: $ d = 10 $\\n- Yellow candies: $ d - 3 = 7 $\\n- Blue candies: $ d - 7 = 3 $\\n\\nLet $ x $ be the equal number of remaining candies. To minimize candies eaten, maximize $ x $ (since total eaten $ = (10 - x) + (7 - x) + (3 - x) = 20 - 3x $). The maximum $ x $ is 3 (limited by blue candies). \\n- Red eaten: $ 10 - 3 = 7 $\\n- Yellow eaten: $ 7 - 3 = 4 $\\n- Blue eaten: $ 3 - 3 = 0 $\\nTotal eaten: $ 7 + 4 + 0 = 11 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
