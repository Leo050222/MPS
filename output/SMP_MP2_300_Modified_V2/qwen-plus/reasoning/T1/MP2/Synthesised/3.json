  "math_problem": "If $x$ and $y$ are positive integers with $x+y=31$, what is the largest possible value of $x y$? Instead of finding the largest possible value of the product $x y$, simply find $k$, which is that largest value minus 231. If a line segment joins the points $(-k,-(k - 7))$ and $((k - 3),(k - 1))$, how many points on the line segment have coordinates that are both integers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, maximize $xy$ given $x + y = 31$ where $x, y$ are positive integers. The product $xy$ is maximized when $x$ and $y$ are as close as possible. Since $31$ is odd, the closest integers are $15$ and $16$, giving $xy = 15 \\\\times 16 = 240$. Then $k = 240 - 231 = 9$. \\n\\nNext, find the number of integer-coordinate points on the line segment joining $(-k, -(k - 7)) = (-9, -2)$ and $(k - 3, k - 1) = (6, 8)$. Compute the differences: $\\\\Delta x = 6 - (-9) = 15$, $\\\\Delta y = 8 - (-2) = 10$. The number of integer points on the segment is $\\\\gcd(15, 10) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
