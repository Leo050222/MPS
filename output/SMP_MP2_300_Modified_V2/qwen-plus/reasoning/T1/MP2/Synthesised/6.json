  "math_problem": "The surface area of a cube is 24. What is the volume of the cube? Instead of determining the volume of the cube, simply find $a$, where $a$ is the length of an edge of the cube. One integer is selected at random from the following list of 15 integers: $1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5$. The probability that the selected integer is equal to $n$ is $a - \\frac{5}{3}$. What is the value of $n$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find the edge length $a$ of the cube. The surface area of a cube is $6a^2 = 24$. Solving for $a$: $a^2 = 4$, so $a = 2$. Next, calculate the probability given by $a - \\\\frac{5}{3} = 2 - \\\\frac{5}{3} = \\\\frac{1}{3}$. The list has 15 integers. The probability of selecting $n$ is $\\\\frac{\\\\text{count of } n}{15}$. Checking counts: $n=5$ appears 5 times, so $\\\\frac{5}{15} = \\\\frac{1}{3}$. Thus, $n = 5$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
