  "math_problem": "Storage space on a computer is measured in gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB), where $1 \\mathrm{~GB} = 1024 \\mathrm{MB}$. Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes. The regular price for a bicycle is $\\\\$(d + 220)$. The bicycle is on sale for $(d - 80)\\\\%$ off. The regular price for a helmet is $\\\\$(d - 20)$. The helmet is on sale for $(d - 90)\\\\%$ off. If Sandra bought both items on sale, what is her percentage savings on the total purchase?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, convert the hard drive capacity from GB to MB. Given 1 GB = 1024 MB, the total capacity C is 300 * 1024 = 307200 MB. Then calculate d = C - 307100 = 307200 - 307100 = 100.\\n\\nNext, determine the regular prices and discounts:\\n- Bicycle regular price: d + 220 = 100 + 220 = $320.\\n- Bicycle discount: (d - 80)% = 20%, so sale price is 320 * (1 - 0.20) = $256.\\n- Helmet regular price: d - 20 = 100 - 20 = $80.\\n- Helmet discount: (d - 90)% = 10%, so sale price is 80 * (1 - 0.10) = $72.\\n\\nTotal regular price: 320 + 80 = $400.\\nTotal sale price: 256 + 72 = $328.\\nTotal savings: 400 - 328 = $72.\\nPercentage savings: (72 / 400) * 100 = 18%.\",\n    \"answer\": \"18\"\n}",
