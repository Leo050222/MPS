  "math_problem": "Let $A$ be the set of all integers $n$ such that $1 \\leq n \\leq 2021$ and $\\gcd(n, 2021) = 1$. For every nonnegative integer $j$, let\n\\[S(j) = \\sum_{n \\in A} n^j.\\]\nDetermine all values of $j$ such that $S(j)$ is a multiple of 2021. Instead of determining the nonnegative integers $j$ for which the power sum over the residues coprime to the modulus is divisible by the modulus, simply find $e = d - 1$, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of the distinct prime factors of the modulus. Determine the maximum value of the sum\n\\[S = \\sum_{n=(e + 1)}^\\infty \\frac{n}{2^n} (a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n)^{1/n}\\]\nover all sequences $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\cdots$ of real numbers satisfying\n\\[\\sum_{k=(e + 1)}^\\infty a_k = (e + 1).\\]",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, factorize 2021 to find its prime factors: 2021 = 43 × 47. The distinct prime factors are 43 and 47. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of these primes is gcd(43, 47) = 1, so d = 1. Thus, e = d - 1 = 0.\\n\\nNext, we need to maximize the sum S = ∑ₙ=₁^∞ (n / 2ⁿ)(a₁a₂⋯aₙ)^(1/n) subject to ∑ₖ=₁^∞ aₖ = 1 (since e + 1 = 1). \\n\\nUsing the method of Lagrange multipliers and testing geometric sequences, we consider aₖ = (1 - r)r^(k-1) for 0 < r < 1, ensuring ∑ₖ=₁^∞ aₖ = 1. The product term becomes (a₁a₂⋯aₙ)^(1/n) = (1 - r)r^((n-1)/2). Substituting into S and simplifying, we find S = (1 - r)/(2(1 - √r/2)²). Maximizing this expression with respect to r, we set t = √r and find the critical point at t = 1/2 (i.e., r = 1/4). This gives S = 2/3.\\n\\nTesting other sequences (e.g., equal terms, two-term sequences) yields lower values, confirming that the maximum value of S is 2/3.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2/3\"\n}",
