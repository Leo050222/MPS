  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the functional equation $f(xy + f(x)) = xf(y) + 2$ for $f:\\\\mathbb{R}^+ \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^+$. Setting $x = 1$, we get $f(y + f(1)) = f(y) + 2$. Let $c = f(1)$, so $f(y + c) = f(y) + 2$. Assuming a linear solution $f(x) = mx + b$, substituting into the equation yields $m = 1$ and $b = 1$, so $f(x) = x + 1$. Verifying, $f(xy + f(x)) = xy + x + 2 = x(y + 1) + 2 = xf(y) + 2$, which holds. Thus, $f(1) = 2$, so $k = f(1) - 2 = 0$.\\n\\nNext, determine $\\\\alpha$ such that for every continuous $f:[0,1] \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$, differentiable on $(0,1)$, with $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, there exists $\\\\xi \\\\in (0,1)$ where $f(\\\\xi) + \\\\alpha = f'(\\\\xi)$. Define $\\\\phi(x) = e^{-x}f(x) - \\\\frac{1}{e-1}(1 - e^{-x})$. Then $\\\\phi(0) = \\\\phi(1) = 0$, so by Rolle's theorem, there exists $\\\\xi \\\\in (0,1)$ with $\\\\phi'(\\\\xi) = 0$. Computing $\\\\phi'(x) = e^{-x}(f'(x) - f(x) - \\\\frac{1}{e-1})$, setting $\\\\phi'(\\\\xi) = 0$ gives $f'(\\\\xi) - f(\\\\xi) = \\\\frac{1}{e-1}$. For $\\\\alpha \\\\neq \\\\frac{1}{e-1}$, the function $f(x) = \\\\frac{e^x - 1}{e - 1}$ satisfies $f(0) = 0$, $f(1) = 1$, but $f'(x) - f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{e-1} \\\\neq \\\\alpha$ for all $x$, so no such $\\\\xi$ exists. Thus, the only valid $\\\\alpha$ is $\\\\frac{1}{e-1}$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/(e-1)\"\n}",
