Instead of finding all monic polynomials with integer coefficients such that there exists a positive integer $N$ where for every prime $p>N$ with $f(p)$ a positive integer, $p$ divides $2(f(p)!)+1$, simply find $d = k - 2$, where $k$ is the absolute value of the constant term in the unique linear monic polynomial with integer coefficients that satisfies the condition. Does there exist a function $f: \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R $  satisfying the following conditions: \n(i) for each real $y$  there is a real  $x$ such that $f(x)=y$ , and \n(ii)  $f(f(x)) = (x - d)f(x) + (d + 1)$ for all real $x$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, consider linear monic polynomials $ f(x) = x + c $ with integer coefficients. For primes $ p > N $, $ f(p) = p + c $ must be positive, so $ c $ is likely negative. Let $ c = -m $ ( $ m > 0 $), so $ f(p) = p - m $. Using Wilson's theorem, $ (p-1)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. For $ f(p)! = (p - m)! $, we need $ 2(p - m)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. Expanding $ (p-1)! = (p-1)(p-2)\\\\cdots(p - m + 1)(p - m)! \\\\equiv (-1)^{m-1}(m-1)!(p - m)! \\\\mod p $, and by Wilson's theorem, this equals $ -1 \\\\mod p $. Solving $ 2(p - m)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $ leads to $ 2(-1)^{m-1} = (m-1)! $. Testing values, $ m = 3 $ satisfies $ 2 \\\\cdot 1 = 2! $, so $ c = -3 $. The constant term is $ -3 $, so $ k = 3 $, giving $ d = k - 2 = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, check if a function $ f: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} $ exists with $ f(f(x)) = (x - 1)f(x) + 2 $ and surjectivity. Assume $ f $ is surjective; it must also be injective (if $ f(x_1) = f(x_2) $, then $ x_1 = x_2 $). Let $ f(0) = a $, then $ f(a) = -a + 2 $. For $ x = 1 $, $ f(f(1)) = 2 $, so $ f(1) = 0 $ (since $ f(0) = 2 $ and injectivity). For $ x = 0 $, $ f(2) = 0 $. Thus $ f(1) = f(2) = 0 $ with $ 1 \\\\neq 2 $, contradicting injectivity. Hence, no such function exists.\",\n    \"answer\": \"No\"\n}",
