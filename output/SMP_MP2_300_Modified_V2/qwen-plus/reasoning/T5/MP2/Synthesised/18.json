  "math_problem": "The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers and takes non-negative integer values. $f(2)=0,f(3)>0,f(9999)=3333$ and for all $m,n:$ \\[ f(m+n)-f(m)-f(n)=0 \\text{ or } 1. \\] Determine $f(1982)$. Instead of determining the value attained by the function at 1982, simply find $k = f(3) + 1$, where $f(3)$ is the positive integer value attained by the function at 3. Consider $(k + 7)$ points in space, no four of which are coplanar. Each pair of points is joined by an edge (that is, a line segment) and each edge is either colored with one of $k$ colors or left uncolored. Find the smallest value of $\\,n\\,$ such that whenever exactly $\\,n\\,$ edges are colored, the set of colored edges necessarily contains a triangle all of whose edges have the same color.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The function $ f(n) $ satisfies $ f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) \\\\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\} $, with $ f(2) = 0 $, $ f(3) > 0 $, and $ f(9999) = 3333 $. By analyzing the functional equation and using induction, we find $ f(n) = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n}{3} \\\\right\\\\rfloor $. This gives $ f(3) = 1 $, so $ k = f(3) + 1 = 2 $. \\n\\nNext, we consider $ k + 7 = 9 $ points in space. The problem reduces to finding the smallest $ n $ such that any 2-coloring of $ n $ edges among these 9 points contains a monochromatic triangle. The maximum number of edges that can be 2-colored without a monochromatic triangle is the sum of two triangle-free graphs. Using Mantel's theorem, the largest triangle-free graph on 9 vertices has 20 edges (complete bipartite $ K_{4,5} $). The complement of $ K_{4,5} $ is $ K_4 \\\\cup K_5 $, whose largest triangle-free subgraph has $ 4 + 6 = 10 $ edges. Thus, the maximum edges without a monochromatic triangle is $ 20 + 10 = 30 $. Therefore, the smallest $ n $ ensuring a monochromatic triangle is $ 30 + 1 = 31 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"31\"\n}",
