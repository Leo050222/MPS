  "math_problem": "Find all functions $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ which satisfy the following equality for all $x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}$\n\\[f(x)f(y)-f(x-1)-f(y+1)=f(xy)+2x-2y-4.\\] Instead of determining all real-valued functions satisfying the given functional equation for all real inputs, simply find $k = q + 10$, where $q$ is the coefficient of the linear term in the quadratic polynomial that satisfies the equation. Let $f$ be a monic cubic polynomial satisfying $f(x)+f(-x)=0$ for all real numbers $x$. For all real numbers $y$, define $g(y)$ to be the number of distinct real solutions $x$ to the equation $f(f(x))=y$. Suppose that the set of possible values of $g(y)$ over all real numbers $y$ is exactly $\\{1,5,9\\}$. Compute the sum of all possible values of $f(k)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve for the quadratic polynomial satisfying the functional equation. Assume $ f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $. By equating coefficients on both sides of the equation, we find $ a = 1 $, $ b = 0 $, and $ c = 1 $. Thus, $ f(x) = x^2 + 1 $, so the linear term coefficient $ q = 0 $. Hence, $ k = q + 10 = 10 $.\\n\\nNext, consider the monic cubic polynomial $ f(x) $ satisfying $ f(x) + f(-x) = 0 $, so $ f(x) = x^3 + ax $. For $ f(f(x)) = y $, the number of real solutions $ g(y) $ must be exactly $ \\\\{1, 5, 9\\\\} $. Analyzing the critical points and symmetry, we find $ a = -3 $ is the only value where $ g(y) $ skips 3 and 7. Thus, $ f(x) = x^3 - 3x $.\\n\\nFinally, compute $ f(k) = f(10) = 10^3 - 3 \\\\cdot 10 = 970 $. Since this is the only possible $ f $, the sum of all possible values of $ f(k) $ is 970.\",\n    \"answer\": \"970\"\n}",
