  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the extremal cubic polynomial $ P(x) $ of degree 3 that has a root in $[0,1]$ and is normalized so that $ \\\\max_{x \\\\in [0,1]} |P(x)| = 1 $. The goal is to find $ \\\\alpha = P(1) $, where $ P $ achieves the supremum of $ \\\\int_0^1 |P(x)| \\\\, dx $ among all such polynomials.\\n\\n### Step 1: Understanding the Extremal Polynomial\\n\\nThe key insight comes from approximation theory. For a cubic polynomial with a root in $[0,1]$, the extremal polynomial that maximizes the integral $ \\\\int_0^1 |P(x)| \\\\, dx $ under the constraint $ \\\\max |P| = 1 $ is closely related to the Chebyshev polynomial of degree 3.\\n\\nThe Chebyshev polynomial $ T_3(t) = 4t^3 - 3t $ oscillates between $-1$ and $1$ on $[-1,1]$, achieving its extrema at $ t = -1, -\\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\frac{1}{2}, 1 $. To map this to the interval $[0,1]$, we use the transformation $ t = 2x - 1 $, which maps $ x \\\\in [0,1] $ to $ t \\\\in [-1,1] $.\\n\\nDefine:\\n$$\\nP(x) = T_3(2x - 1) = 4(2x - 1)^3 - 3(2x - 1)\\n$$\\nExpanding this gives:\\n$$\\nP(x) = 32x^3 - 48x^2 + 18x - 1\\n$$\\nThis polynomial satisfies:\\n- $ P(0) = -1 $\\n- $ P(1/4) = 1 $\\n- $ P(3/4) = -1 $\\n- $ P(1) = 1 $\\n- It has roots at $ x = \\\\frac{2 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{3}}{4} $ and $ x = \\\\frac{1}{2} $, all within $[0,1]$\\n- $ \\\\max_{x \\\\in [0,1]} |P(x)| = 1 $\\n\\nThus, this polynomial is valid for the given constraints.\\n\\n### Step 2: Compute $ \\\\alpha = P(1) $\\n\\nFrom the above, we compute:\\n$$\\nP(1) = 32(1)^3 - 48(1)^2 + 18(1) - 1 = 1\\n$$\\nHence, $ \\\\alpha = 1 $.\\n\\n### Step 3: Analyze the Second Part of the Problem\\n\\nGiven $ \\\\alpha = 1 $, the second part involves a monic real polynomial $ p(x) $ of degree $ 2n $ satisfying:\\n$$\\np\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{k}\\\\right) = k^2 \\\\quad \\\\text{for all integers } k \\\\text{ with } 1 \\\\leq |k| \\\\leq n\\n$$\\nWe are to find all other real numbers $ x $ such that:\\n$$\\np\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) = x^2\\n$$\\n\\nLet us define:\\n$$\\nf(x) = p\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) - x^2\\n$$\\nThen $ f(k) = 0 $ for $ k = \\\\pm 1, \\\\pm 2, \\\\dots, \\\\pm n $, giving $ 2n $ known roots. Since $ p $ is a monic polynomial of degree $ 2n $, the function $ f(x) $ is a rational function whose numerator is a polynomial of degree $ 2n + 2 $ (after clearing denominators).\\n\\nTherefore, the equation $ f(x) = 0 $ has exactly $ 2n + 2 $ roots in total. Given that $ 2n $ of them are already known (the integer values $ \\\\pm 1, \\\\dots, \\\\pm n $), there must be **two additional real roots**.\\n\\nHowever, due to the symmetry and structure of the polynomial, these two extra roots turn out to be **$ x = 0 $** and **$ x = \\\\infty $**, but since $ x = \\\\infty $ is not a real number, only $ x = 0 $ remains as a candidate. However, $ x = 0 $ makes $ \\\\frac{1}{x} $ undefined, so it is not a valid solution.\\n\\nThus, **there are no other real solutions** beyond the given $ 2n $ values.\\n\\nBut the problem specifically asks for **all other real numbers $ x $** for which the equation holds. Since the only possible candidates are invalid or non-real, the conclusion is that **no other real numbers satisfy the equation**.\\n\\nHowever, the problem explicitly states to provide the value of $ \\\\alpha $, which is the main focus of the question.\", \"answer\": \"1\"}",
