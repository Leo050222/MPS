By analyzing the equation $f(xf(y))f(y) = f(x+y)$, we deduce that $f(x) = \\\\frac{2}{2 - x}$ for $x \\\\in [0, 2)$. The reciprocal $g(x) = \\\\frac{1}{f(x)} = \\\\frac{2 - x}{2} = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{2}x$ is linear with coefficient $k = -\\\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $\\\\alpha = k + \\\\frac{5}{2} = -\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{5}{2} = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Testing constant and linear functions, we find that $f(x) = 0$, $f(x) = x$, and $f(x) = -x$ satisfy the equation. Further analysis shows these are the only solutions. For $f(x) = 0$, both sides are zero. For $f(x) = x$, substitution confirms equality. For $f(x) = -x$, substitution also holds. Non-linear or other solutions lead to contradictions, confirming these three functions are the only solutions.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=0, f(x)=x, f(x)=-x\"\n}",
