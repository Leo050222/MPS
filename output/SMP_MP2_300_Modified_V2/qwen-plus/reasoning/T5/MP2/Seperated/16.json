How many red monochromatic triangles\nare there?

Thus, k = 41. The problem asks for e = k - 39, so e = 41 - 39 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume f(x) = x + 1. Verify: f(xy + f(x)) = f(xy + x + 1) = xy + x + 2. Right side: x f(y) + 2 = x(y + 1) + 2 = xy + x + 2. This holds. To confirm uniqueness, set x = 1 to get f(y + f(1)) = f(y) + 2, suggesting linearity. Solving functional equations leads to f(x) = x + 1 as the only solution satisfying all conditions.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = x + 1\"\n}",
