For large n, the dominant term is from the largest xⱼ. Suppose max xⱼ = M, then the sum ~ S Mⁿ where S is the sum of j with xⱼ=M. This must equal aⁿ⁺¹ + 1 ~ aⁿ⁺¹, so S Mⁿ ≈ aⁿ⁺¹ ⇒ a ≈ M. Thus, S = M (from asymptotic analysis). The only way the sum equals Mⁿ⁺¹ + 1 for all n is if there's exactly one j=M with xⱼ=M and the remaining sum (from xⱼ=1) equals 1. This requires j=1 to be the only term with xⱼ=1 (sum j=1), so the sequence must have exactly two terms: (x₁,x₂)=(1,2). However, the problem has 2011 terms, so additional terms (j≥3) with xⱼ=1 contribute a constant sum >0, making the total sum = 2ⁿ⁺¹ + C (C>0), which cannot equal aⁿ⁺¹ + 1 for all n. Thus, no such sequences exist for 2011 terms.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"no such sequences\"\n}",
