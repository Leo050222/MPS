This implies $ 2a - 1 \\\\mid 1 $, so $ 2a - 1 = 1 $, giving $ a = 1 $. Thus, $ k = f(1) + 2 = 3 $. Verification with $ f(n) = n^2 $ confirms it satisfies the condition, and $ f(1) = 1 $ is forced.\\n\\nProblem 2: Testing constant polynomials shows only the zero polynomial works. For linear polynomials $ P(x) = cx $, substitution confirms they satisfy the equation for any real $ c $. Higher-degree polynomials fail due to mismatched coefficients (e.g., quadratic terms introduce constants that don't cancel). Thus, all solutions are linear polynomials $ P(x) = cx $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"P(x) = cx for some real constant c\"\n}",
