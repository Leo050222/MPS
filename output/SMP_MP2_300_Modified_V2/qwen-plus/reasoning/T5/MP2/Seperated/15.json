Instead of finding all monic polynomials with integer coefficients such that there exists a positive integer $N$ where for every prime $p>N$ with $f(p)$ a positive integer, $p$ divides $2(f(p)!)+1$, simply find $d = k - 2$, where $k$ is the absolute value of the constant term in the unique linear monic polynomial with integer coefficients that satisfies the condition."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Consider linear monic polynomials $f(x) = x + c$ with integer $c$. For primes $p > N$, $f(p) = p + c$ must be positive, so $c$ is negative (let $c = -k$, $k > 0$). Using Wilson's theorem, $(p-1)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p$. For $f(p) = p - k$, we need $p \\\\mid 2((p - k)!) + 1$. Testing $k=3$: $(p-1)! = (p-1)(p-2)(p-3)! \\\\equiv (-1)(-2)(p-3)! = 2(p-3)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p$, so $2(p-3)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p$, hence $2((p-3)!) + 1 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod p$. This works for all primes $p > 3$. For $k \\\\neq 3$, contradictions arise (e.g., $k=2$ gives $2 \\\\cdot 1 + 1 = 3 \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod p$ for $p > 3$). The unique linear polynomial is $f(x) = x - 3$, constant term $-3$, absolute value $k=3$. Thus $d = 3 - 2 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume such a function $f$ exists. Surjectivity implies $\\\\exists d$ with $f(d) = 2$. Then $f(2) = 2d$ (from $x=d$). Also, $\\\\exists b$ with $f(b) = -1$, so $f(-1) = -b + 3$ (from $x=b$). From $x=1$, $f(f(1)) = 2$, so $f(1) = d'$ where $f(d') = 2$. If $f(0) = 2$ (so $d=0$), then $f(2) = 0$. But $f(-1) = 1$ (from $f(a)=1 \\\\implies a=-1$), and $f(b)=-1$ implies $b=2$, so $f(2) = -1$. Contradiction: $f(2)$ cannot be both $0$ and $-1$. Hence no such function exists.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
