Assuming linearity and verifying, f(x) = x satisfies the equation. Further analysis shows no other solutions exist due to injectivity, surjectivity, and the derived properties (e.g., f(x²) = (f(x))² and additivity). Thus, the only solution is f(x) = x.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = x\"\n}",
