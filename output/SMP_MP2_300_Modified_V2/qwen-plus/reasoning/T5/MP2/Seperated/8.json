Substituting into the functional equation and equating coefficients, we find $a = 1$, $b = 0$, $c = 1$. Thus, $f(x) = x^2 + 1$, where the linear term coefficient $q = 0$. Therefore, $k = q + 10 = 10$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The monic cubic polynomial satisfying $f(x) + f(-x) = 0$ must be $f(x) = x^3 + px$. Analysis shows $p = -3$ is the only value where the set of $g(y)$ values is exactly $\\\\{1, 5, 9\\\\}$. Thus, $f(10) = 10^3 - 3 \\\\cdot 10 = 970$. Since this is the only possible value, the sum is $970$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"970\"\n}",
