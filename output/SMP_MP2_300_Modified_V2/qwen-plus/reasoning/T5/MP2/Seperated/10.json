The greatest common divisor (gcd) of these primes is 1 since they are distinct. Thus, d = 1, and e = d - 1 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize the sum S, consider sequences where a_k follows a geometric progression. Setting a_k = 3/4^k satisfies the constraint sum a_k = 1. Calculating the sum S with this sequence yields S = 2/3. Testing other sequences (e.g., single-term, two-term) results in lower values. Using Lagrange multipliers confirms that the geometric sequence provides the critical point, and the sum converges to 2/3, which is the maximum value.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2/3\"\n}",
