The coefficient of $ x $ gives $ -2a f(y) + b = f(y) + b $, leading to $ -2a = 1 $ so $ a = -1/2 $. Thus $ p = -1/2 $, and $ k = p + 1/2 = 0 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Test polynomial degrees. Constant and linear polynomials only yield the zero polynomial. For quadratic $ f(x) = ax^2 $, the equation holds for all $ a,b,c $ with $ ab + bc + ca = 0 $. Higher-degree polynomials fail due to mismatched leading terms. Thus, all solutions are $ f(x) = kx^2 $ for real $ k $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = kx^2 for some real constant k\"\n}",
