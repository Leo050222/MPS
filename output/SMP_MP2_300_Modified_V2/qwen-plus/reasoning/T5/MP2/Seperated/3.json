Additionally, the 99 points form a path where consecutive pairs (e.g., $(k,1)$ and $(k+1,1)$) contribute 98 edges. This gives $99 + 98 = 197$ edges. This matches the pattern $2n - 3$ for $n=100$, which is the maximum possible due to constraints on determinant conditions.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"197\"\n}",
