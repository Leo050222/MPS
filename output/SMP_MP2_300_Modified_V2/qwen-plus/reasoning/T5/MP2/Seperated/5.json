This is because any two non-adjacent vertices must share a common neighbor (to ensure adding their edge forms a triangle), so their distance is 2. Adjacent vertices have distance 1, and the graph isn't complete (triangle-free), so diameter is exactly 2. Thus, diam(G) = 2, so d = 2 - 2 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume f is constant, f(x) = c. Then 3c = 1 ⇒ c = 1/3. Testing shows this works. To check uniqueness, substitutions (e.g., y=1, z=1/x) lead to equations like 2f(x+1) + f(2/x) = 1. Assuming non-constant f leads to contradictions via iterative substitutions requiring f to stay positive, forcing f(x) = 1/3 for all x > 0.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = 1/3\"\n}",
