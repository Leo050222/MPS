Using x = 1, y = -1 leads to f(1) = c. Setting y = 1 gives c f(x) = f(x+1)f(x). Assuming f(x) ≠ 0 (as f(0) ≠ 0 and contradictions arise if f(x) = 0), f(x+1) = c for all x, implying f is constant. Constant solutions require 2c = c², so c = 2 (since c ≠ 0). Thus d = c - 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume f is quadratic. Testing f(x) = x² + 1 satisfies the equation. Verifying coefficients and specific values confirms it works. The recurrence from x = 0 and x = 1 leads to f(y+1) - f(y) = 2y + 1, solved by f(x) = x² + 1. No other solutions exist as the functional equation enforces this quadratic form.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"x^2 + 1\"\n}",
