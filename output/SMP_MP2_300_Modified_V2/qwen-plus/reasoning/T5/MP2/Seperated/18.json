Given $ f(2) = 0 $, we deduce $ f(1) = 0 $ (since $ f(2) = 2f(1) + d $, $ d \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\} $, and $ f(2) = 0 $ implies $ f(1) = 0 $). For $ f(3) $, using $ m=2, n=1 $, $ f(3) = f(2) + f(1) + d = d $, and since $ f(3) > 0 $, $ d=1 $, so $ f(3) = 1 $. Verifying with $ f(9999) = 3333 $, the function $ f(n) = \\\\lfloor n/3 \\\\rfloor $ satisfies all conditions (e.g., $ f(3k) = k $, $ f(9999) = 3333 $). Thus, $ k = f(3) + 1 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need the smallest $ n $ such that any $ n $ colored edges (red/blue) on 9 vertices contain a monochromatic triangle. The maximum number of edges without a monochromatic triangle is the sum of two triangle-free graphs. The Turán number $ \\\\text{ex}(9, K_3) = 20 $ (complete bipartite $ K_{4,5} $). The complement of $ K_{4,5} $ is $ K_4 \\\\cup K_5 $, with maximum triangle-free subgraphs $ \\\\text{ex}(4, K_3) = 4 $ and $ \\\\text{ex}(5, K_3) = 6 $, totaling 10 edges. Thus, maximum edges without a monochromatic triangle is $ 20 + 10 = 30 $. Hence, $ n = 31 $ is the smallest value where any coloring must contain a monochromatic triangle.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"31\"\n}",
