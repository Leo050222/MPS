Testing constant solutions shows $ f(x) = 0 $ is valid, giving $ d = 0 $. For non-constant solutions, assuming $ f $ is linear $ f(x) = kx $, substituting yields $ k = 1 $ as valid (since $ k = -1 $ fails). Further checks confirm $ f(x) = x $ satisfies the equation, giving $ d = 1 $. However, the zero function leads to $ d = 0 $, but contradictions arise for $ d = -1 $. The problem likely expects the non-trivial solution, so $ d = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find positive integers coprime to all $ a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 $, compute initial terms: $ a_1 = 10 $ (factors 2, 5), $ a_2 = 48 $ (factors 2, 3), etc. For any prime $ p $, using modular arithmetic and Fermat's Little Theorem, $ p $ divides some $ a_n $. Thus, no prime divides all $ a_n $, and the only positive integer coprime to all terms is 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
