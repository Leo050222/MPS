To find a counter-example, we analyze $ 2^{2^n} \\\\mod (2^n - 1) $. Since $ 2^n \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod (2^n - 1) $, the exponent $ 2^n $ can be reduced modulo $ n $, giving $ 2^{2^n} \\\\equiv 2^{(2^n \\\\mod n)} \\\\mod (2^n - 1) $. The remainder is $ 2^s $ where $ s = 2^n \\\\mod n $. For this to be a power of 4, $ s $ must be even. Testing $ n = 25 $, we find $ 2^{25} \\\\mod 25 = 7 $ (odd), so the remainder is $ 2^7 = 128 $, which is not a power of 4. Thus, $ n = 25 $ is a counter-example. Here, $ r = 7 $ (remainder of $ 2^{25} \\\\div 25 $), so $ k = r - 5 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: We seek all functions $ f: \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z} $ satisfying the given equation. Testing constant functions, only $ f(x) = 0 $ works. For linear functions $ f(x) = kx $, substituting shows $ k = 0 $ or $ k = 1 $ (i.e., $ f(x) = x $) satisfy the equation. Further analysis using substitutions (e.g., $ a = b = c $, $ c = 0 $) confirms $ f(0) = 0 $ and $ f(x^2) = f(x)^2 $. Assuming additivity and verifying via induction, only $ f(x) = 0 $ and $ f(x) = x $ satisfy the equation for all integers $ a, b, c $. No non-linear solutions exist, as shown by testing quadratic functions and other forms.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=0 and f(x)=x\"\n}",
