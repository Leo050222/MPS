Setting $x = 1$ gives $f(y + f(1)) = f(y) + 2$, suggesting linearity. Assuming $f(x) = ax + b$, substitution yields $a = 1$, $b = 1$, so $f(x) = x + 1$. Verifying, $f(1) = 2$, hence $k = 2 - 2 = 0$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For the condition $f(\\\\xi) + \\\\alpha = f'(\\\\xi)$ to hold for all valid $f$, define $g(x) = e^{-x}f(x)$. Then $g'(x) = e^{-x}(f'(x) - f(x))$, so the equation becomes $g'(\\\\xi) = \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\xi}$. Using Rolle's theorem on $h(x) = g(x) - \\\\alpha(1 - e^{-x})$, we require $h(0) = h(1) = 0$, leading to $\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{e - 1}$. Counterexamples confirm this is the only solution.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/(e-1)\"\n}",
