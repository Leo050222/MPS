Through analysis of critical points and maximizing the integral under the constraint, the polynomial P(x) = 4x³ - 8x² + 5x is identified. This polynomial satisfies P(1/2) = 1 (local maximum), P(1) = 1, and has a local minimum at x=5/6. The maximum absolute value is 1, and the integral is maximized. Thus, α = P(1) = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given a monic polynomial p of degree 2n (n even) with p(1/k) = k² for integers k where 1 ≤ |k| ≤ n, we define q(x) = p(1/x) - x². The equation p(1/x) = x² is equivalent to q(x) = 0. By constructing the polynomial s(y) = y²p(y) - 1, which has roots at y = ±1, ±2, ..., ±n and y = ±1/1, ±1/2, ..., ±1/n, the solutions for x are x = 1/y. The given solutions are x = ±k (integers with 1 ≤ |k| ≤ n), so the other solutions are x = ±1/k for k = 1, 2, ..., n. These are the real numbers not in the given set of integers but satisfying the equation.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"±1/k for k=1,2,...,n\"\n}",
