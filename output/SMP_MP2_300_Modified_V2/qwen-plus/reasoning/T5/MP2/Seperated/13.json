Since f(9999)=3333=3·3333, we have 3333 ≥ 3333·f(3), so f(3) ≤ 1. As f(3)>0, f(3)=1. Thus, k = f(3)+1 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need σ(n)/(p(n)-1)=n where p(n) is the largest prime divisor. Testing small n, n=6 works: σ(6)=12, p(n)=3, 12/(3-1)=6. For prime powers, no solutions. For composite n with multiple primes, only n=6 satisfies the equation. Other candidates fail the divisor sum condition.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
