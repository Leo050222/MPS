      "A1098": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability $ p $ is derived by analyzing the recursive structure of valid transitions where each step leaves a multiple of 5 rocks. The key insight is recognizing the recurrence relation for the probability $ f(m) $ starting from $ m = 403 $ (since $ 2015 = 5 \\\\times 403 $). Using the identity for the sum $ S(m) $, we find $ f(403) = \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{k=1}^{402} (5k + 1)}{5^{403} \\\\cdot 403!} $. Calculating the 31-adic valuation, we determine the exponent $ b = 1 $ for 31 in the simplified form of $ p $. Thus, $ m = b + 2 = 3 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using the identity $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) $, we substitute $ x + y + z = 3 $ and $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 $ to find $ xyz = 3(xy + yz + zx) - 8 $. Solving for symmetric cases, we find the solutions are either all ones or permutations of $ (-5, 4, 4) $. These are the only solutions where variables are real or complex, as verified by parameterizing the system and checking discriminants.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(1,1,1) and permutations of (-5,4,4)\"\n}",
