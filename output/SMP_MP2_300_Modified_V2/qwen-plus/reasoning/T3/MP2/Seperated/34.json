You repeatedly do the following: select two points on the twig independently and uniformly at random, make cuts on these two points, and keep only the largest piece. After 2012 repetitions, what is the expected length of the remaining piece? Instead of computing the expected remaining length after many such cutting operations, simply find $k = a_1 + \\frac{133}{18}$, where $a_1$ is the expected length of the longest piece obtained from a unit-length twig in a single operation of selecting two uniform random points, cutting, and retaining the largest segment."

The expected maximum length $ a_1 $ for a single operation is a known result derived from integrating over the joint distribution of two uniform random variables. By analyzing the regions where each segment is the longest and computing the expectation, it is found that $ a_1 = \\\\frac{11}{18} $. Thus, $ k = \\\\frac{11}{18} + \\\\frac{133}{18} = \\\\frac{144}{18} = 8 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Kevin starts with vectors $ (1,0) $ and $ (0,1) $. Each operation replaces one vector with their sum, preserving the determinant (which remains 1). The cotangent of the angle between the vectors equals their dot product. To minimize the angle, the dot product must be maximized. After 8 steps, the maximum dot product corresponds to the 16th Fibonacci number (with $ F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1 $), which is $ F_{16} = 987 $. Hence, the cotangent of the minimum angle is 987.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"8\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"987\"\n}",
