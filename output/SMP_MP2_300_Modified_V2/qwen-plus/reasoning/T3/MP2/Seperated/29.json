Rotations of the same cube are not considered distinct, but reflections are. Instead of determining the number of distinct cubes up to rotations, simply find $k = m - 34$, where $m$ is the number of ways to choose which of the remaining cubes occupy the positions adjacent to the fixed cube, derived from the analysis of fixing one cube's position to account for rotational symmetry."

The number of ways to choose which 3 of the remaining 7 cubes occupy these adjacent positions is the combination C(7,3) = 35. Thus, m = 35. Then k = m - 34 = 35 - 34 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The sum of coefficients of P(x) is P(1). Define Q(x) = P(x) - (x + 6), which has roots at 5, 11, 17. Since P(x) is quartic, Q(x) = (x-5)(x-11)(x-17)(x-k). The x³ coefficient of P(x) is -29, so -(5+11+17+k) = -29 ⇒ k = -4. Then P(1) = (1-5)(1-11)(1-17)(1+4) + 1 + 6 = (-4)(-10)(-16)(5) + 7 = -3200 + 7 = -3193.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-3193\"\n}",
