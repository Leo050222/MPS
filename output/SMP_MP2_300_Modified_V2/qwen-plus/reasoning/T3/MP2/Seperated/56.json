Find the probability that there exist positive integers $b, c \\geq 1$ such that $f^{b}(1)=a$ and $f^{c}(a)=1$. $\\left(f^{k}(x)\\right.$ denotes the result of applying $f$ to $x k$ times). Instead of determining the probability that the randomly selected $a$ lies in the same cycle as the fixed starting point $1$ in the functional graph of the random function, simply find $k = p_1 + 2$, where $p_1$ is the initial avoidance factor representing the likelihood of no prior distinct iterates before immediate potential closure to $1$, derived from the step-by-step construction of the cycle length distribution containing $1$."

Through analysis of functional graphs, the expected cycle length containing node 1 is 1 for any n. The 'initial avoidance factor' refers to the probability of avoiding immediate closure (cycle length 1), which asymptotically approaches 1 as n grows. Thus, p₁ ≈ 1, leading to k = 1 + 2 = 3.\\n\\nProblem 2: This asks for the number of monotonic Boolean functions over 3 variables. Monotonic functions correspond to antichains in the Boolean lattice {0,1}³. The Dedekind number for n=3 is known to be 20, which counts all such antichains (and thus monotonic functions).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"20\"\n}",
