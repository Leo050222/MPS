Since √4 is always 2 (a rational number), k = 2 - 1 = 1. The structural analysis of the nested square root √(1.5 + √2) confirms that the denesting process involves rational components, but the problem explicitly defines √4 as the rational component, making k = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let α = 1 - ∛2 + ∛4. Let β = ∛2, so β³ = 2 and α = β² - β + 1. By manipulating equations involving β and α, we derive α³ - 3α² + 9α - 9 = 0. This cubic polynomial is monic, has integer coefficients, and is irreducible over ℚ (verified via Rational Root Theorem), confirming it is the minimal degree polynomial satisfying P(α) = 0.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"x^3 - 3x^2 + 9x - 9\"\n}",
