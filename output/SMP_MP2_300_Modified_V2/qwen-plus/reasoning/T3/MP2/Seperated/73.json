  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Given $f(x) = x^3 + 3x - 1$ with roots $a, b, c$, we use Vieta's formulas: $a + b + c = 0$, $ab + bc + ca = 3$, $abc = 1$. For each root, $x^3 = 1 - 3x$. Thus, $a^3 + b^3 = 2 + 3c$ (since $a + b = -c$). The sum becomes $\\\\sum \\\\frac{1}{2 + 3c}$. Constructing a polynomial with roots $3a + 2$, $3b + 2$, $3c + 2$ via substitution $x = (y - 2)/3$ into $f(x)$ yields $y^3 - 6y^2 + 39y - 89 = 0$. The sum of reciprocals of roots is $\\\\frac{39}{89}$. Then $k = \\\\frac{39}{89} + \\\\frac{50}{89} = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The Pell equation $x^2 - 29y^2 = 1$ has minimal solution found via continued fractions of $\\\\sqrt{29}$. The continued fraction period is 5 (odd), so the minimal solution corresponds to the convergent at the end of the second period. Calculating convergents, the minimal solution is $x = 9801$, $y = 1820$, giving $x + y = 11621$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11621\"\n}",
