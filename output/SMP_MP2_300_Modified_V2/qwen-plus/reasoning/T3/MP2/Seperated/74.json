Given $P(1) = 20$ and $P(-1) = 22$, we derive:\\n- $a + b + c = 20$\\n- $a - b + c = 22$\\nSubtracting these equations gives $2b = -2 \\\\implies b = -1$. The value of $b$ is uniquely determined by these conditions, regardless of other constraints. Thus, $k = b + 3 = -1 + 3 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Rearrange the equation $2x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2x - 4y + 2xz - 5$ to:\\n$$2x^2 - 2xz - 2x + y^2 + 4y + z^2 + 5 = 0$$\\nCompleting the square:\\n- $2x^2 - 2xz = 2\\\\left(x - \\\\frac{z}{2}\\\\right)^2 - \\\\frac{z^2}{2}$\\n- $y^2 + 4y = (y + 2)^2 - 4$\\nSubstituting and simplifying leads to:\\n$$(x - 1)^2 + (x - z)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 0$$\\nThis implies $x = 1$, $z = 1$, $y = -2$. Thus, $x - y + z = 1 - (-2) + 1 = 4$, which is the only solution and hence the maximum value.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4\"\n}",
