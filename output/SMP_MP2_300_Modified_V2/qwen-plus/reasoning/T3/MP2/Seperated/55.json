  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The quartic equation $r^4 + kr^3 + r^2 + 4kr + 16 = 0$ is analyzed for factorization. It factors into $(r^2 + ar + 4)(r^2 + cr + 4)$ where $a + c = k$ and $ac = -7$. For exactly one positive real root, one quadratic must have a double root (discriminant zero) and the other no real roots. Setting $a = -4$ (yielding a double root at $r = 2$, positive), we find $c = 7/4$. Thus, $k = a + c = -9/4$. Calculating $e = \\\\kappa + \\\\frac{40009}{4}$ gives $e = \\\\frac{-9 + 40009}{4} = 10000$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The sum of digits from 1 to $n$ is calculated incrementally. Sum up to 699 is 8400. The sum from 700 to 799 is 1600 (hundreds digit sum 700, tens/units sum 900), totaling 10,000. Thus, $n = 799$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10000\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"799\"\n}",
