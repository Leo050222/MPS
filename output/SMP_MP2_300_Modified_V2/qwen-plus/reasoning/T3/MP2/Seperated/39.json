Factoring and analyzing discriminants leads to solving $y^2 + 2m^2 = 249$. Testing odd $y$ values yields valid solutions at $y = 7$ (giving $x = 11$) and $y = 11$ (giving $x = 7$). The equation is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, so both pairs $(7, 11)$ and $(11, 7)$ are solutions.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(7,11) and (11,7)\"\n}",
