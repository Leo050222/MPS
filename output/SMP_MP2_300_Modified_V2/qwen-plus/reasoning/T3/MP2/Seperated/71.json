Subsets with largest element 5 must include 5 and elements from $ \\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\} $. Valid subsets $ S = \\\\{5\\\\} \\\\cup A $ (where $ A \\\\subseteq \\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\} $) must not have any subset summing to 10. This requires $ A $ to avoid subsets summing to 5 (to prevent $ 5 + \\\\text{sum} = 10 $) and $ A \\\\neq \\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\} $ (to avoid sum 10). Valid $ A $ are: $ \\\\emptyset, \\\\{1\\\\}, \\\\{2\\\\}, \\\\{3\\\\}, \\\\{4\\\\}, \\\\{1,2\\\\}, \\\\{1,3\\\\}, \\\\{2,4\\\\}, \\\\{3,4\\\\} $ (9 subsets). Thus $ N_5 = 9 $, so $ k = 9 - 8 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Find ordered triples $ (a,b,c) $ of nonnegative integers satisfying $ (ab+1)(bc+1)(ca+1) = 84 $. Factorizations of 84 into three positive integers are analyzed. Valid cases:\\n- Two factors are 1, one is 84: Each permutation gives 2 solutions (e.g., $ a=0 $, $ bc=83 $), totaling 6 solutions.\\n- Permutations of $ (3,4,7) $: Corresponds to $ ab=2, bc=3, ca=6 $, yielding permutations of $ (1,2,3) $, totaling 6 solutions.\\nTotal solutions: 6 + 6 = 12.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
