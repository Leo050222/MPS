Substituting $z_n = w_n - \\\\frac{1}{2}$ into the recurrence gives $w_{n+1} = 2w_n^2$. Given $z_{10} = 2017$, we have $w_{10} = z_{10} + \\\\frac{1}{2} = 2017 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{4035}{2}$.

This factors as $(n - m)(n + m) = 3000$. Both factors must be even (since their product is even and they must have the same parity). Let $a = n - m$, $b = n + m$, so $ab = 3000$ and $n = \\\\frac{a + b}{2}$. Valid factor pairs $(a, b)$ with $a < b$ and both even yield $n$ values: 55, 65, 85, 131, 155, 253, 377, 751. Summing these gives $55 + 65 + 85 + 131 + 155 + 253 + 377 + 751 = 1872$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3000\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1872\"\n}",
