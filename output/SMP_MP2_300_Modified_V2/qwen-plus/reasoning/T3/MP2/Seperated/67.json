The equation φ(2019n) = φ(n²) simplifies using Euler's totient function properties. Factoring 2019 = 3×673 (primes), and analyzing the prime exponents in n, we find the only valid solution where n is a multiple of 2019 is n = 2019. Thus, gcd(2019, n) = 2019, so k = 2019 - 2018 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Define b_n = a_n + 1. The recurrence simplifies to b_{n+1} = b_n² / b_{n-1}, indicating a geometric sequence. Given a₁ = 1, b₁ = 2. With a₉ = 7, b₉ = 8. Solving b₉ = 2r⁸ = 8 gives r⁸ = 4, so r⁴ = 2. Then b₅ = 2r⁴ = 4, so a₅ = 4 - 1 = 3.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
