Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing the sum of all possible totals and the associated $100m + n$, simply find $k = z - 2$, where $z$ is the common value taken by the two equal variables in the solution where exactly two of the variables are equal."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We consider the case where exactly two variables are equal, say $x = y \\\\neq z$. From the given equations, solving leads to the cubic equation $2x^3 - 9x^2 + 10x - 3 = 0$, with roots $x = 1$, $x = \\\\frac{1}{2}$, and $x = 3$. The roots $x = 1$ and $x = \\\\frac{1}{2}$ result in all variables being equal, which is invalid for exactly two equal variables. The root $x = 3$ gives $x = y = 3$ and $z = -\\\\frac{1}{3}$, so the common value of the two equal variables is 3. Thus, $k = z - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The polygons share vertices: ICAO (square), VENTI (pentagon), and ALBEDO (hexagon). Key shared vertices are $I$ (square and pentagon), $E$ (pentagon and hexagon), $A$ (square and hexagon), and $O$ (square and hexagon). The distance $IN = 1$ fixes the pentagon's scale. The hexagon can have $A$ and $O$ separated by 1 or 2 edges (3 edges is invalid as it would make $E = O$). Each configuration (1 or 2 edges apart) allows two orientations (above/below the line $AO$), but due to symmetry and the problem's constraints, the number of distinct $ON$ values is determined by the valid configurations of the polygons. After analyzing possible orientations and distances, there are exactly 2 distinct values for $ON$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\"\n}",
