For example, $r(2023)=r\\left(11111100111_{2}\\right)=11100111111_{2}=1855$.

Instead of determining whether such a progression exists, simply find $e = \\delta + 19$, where $\\delta$ is the binary digit in the third of three consecutive terms with equal binary length at the minimal bit position $j \\geq 1$ where the binary representations of the first and second of those terms differ, derived from the arithmetic progression relation among the original terms."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The key is analyzing the binary structure of an arithmetic progression (AP) of odd integers where reversing their binary representations also forms an AP. For three consecutive terms with equal binary length, the minimal bit position $ j \\\\geq 2 $ (since all terms are odd) where the first and second terms differ corresponds to the least significant 1 in the common difference $ d $. The third term's bit at position $ j $ must satisfy the condition $ 2r(a+d) = r(a) + r(a+2d) $ for the reversed sequences to form an AP. Through analysis of valid numerical examples and constraints from the AP relation, the bit $ \\\\delta $ at position $ j $ in the third term is consistently 1. Thus, $ e = \\\\delta + 19 = 20 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To ensure no non-empty subset sum is divisible by 20, all elements of $ S $ must be congruent modulo 20 to a fixed residue coprime to 20 (i.e., $ \\\\gcd(a, 20) = 1 $). There are $ \\\\phi(20) = 8 $ such residues (1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19). For each residue, there are exactly 50 numbers in $ \\\\{1, \\\\ldots, 1000\\\\} $, and choosing 19 elements from these gives $ \\\\binom{50}{19} $ subsets per residue.
