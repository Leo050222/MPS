The residues of 2^a mod 5 cycle every 4: [1, 2, 4, 3]. For a from 0 to 7, each residue 1, 2, 3, 4 appears exactly 2 times. The generating function per variable is f(x) = 2(x + x² + x³ + x⁴). Using the roots of unity filter, the number of solutions N is (1/5)[f(1)^5 + 4f(ω)^5], where ω is a primitive 5th root of unity. f(1) = 8, f(ω) = -2. Thus, N = (32768 - 128)/5 = 6528. Then k = N - 6527 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The fractal Sₙ has side length 3ⁿ. The expected Manhattan distance aₙ satisfies the recurrence aₙ = (1/8)aₙ₋₁ + (15/8)3^{n-1}. Solving this, the dominant term gives lim aₙ/3ⁿ = 15/23. Thus, 100a + b = 1523.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1523\"\n}",
