In how many ways is this possible? Instead of determining the total number of valid friendship and enmity assignments among the five people, simply find $q = s - 1$, where $s$ is the number of such assignments in which no two people are friends."

If no two people are friends, all pairs are enemies. The condition states that for any two enemies, there is no common friend. Since there are no friends in this case, the condition is trivially satisfied. There is exactly one such assignment (all enemies), so s = 1. Thus, q = 1 - 1 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using Pick's Theorem (Area = I + B/2 - 1), where I is interior lattice points and B is boundary points. The triangle vertices are (0,99), (5,100), (2003,500). Shoelace formula gives area = 1. Boundary points: AB has gcd(5,1)+1=2 points, BC has gcd(1998,400)+1=3 points, CA has gcd(2003,401)+1=2 points. Total boundary points B = 2+3+2-3=4 (subtracting 3 for overlapping vertices). Solving 1 = I + 4/2 - 1 gives I = 0. Thus, the number of enclosed lattice points (excluding boundary) is 0.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"0\"\n}",
