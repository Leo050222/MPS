      "A1054": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $e = N - 86$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Each of the 8 antigens is included in exactly half of all subsets (since subsets are all possible combinations). With 256 students (2^8 subsets), for any given antigen, the number of students with that antigen is 256/2 = 128. Thus, N = 128. Calculating e = N - 86 gives 128 - 86 = 42.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let the three integers be a, b, c. The operations yield three equations: (a+b)/2 + c = 42, (a+c)/2 + b = 13, (b+c)/2 + a = 37 (in some order). Summing all three results gives 92, so the total sum S = a+b+c = 46. Solving for each variable using S, we find a = 28, b = -20, c = 38 (or permutations). Verifying confirms these values produce the given results.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"42\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-20, 28, 38\"\n}",
