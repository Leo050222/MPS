Instead of computing the total number of such valid colorings, simply find $m = N_1 + 1968$, where $N_1$ is the number of valid colorings arising from partitioning the vertices into two disjoint scalene triangles and a singleton vertex, with each part monochromatic in a distinct color."

A regular heptagon has 7 vertices. For each singleton (7 choices), there is exactly one way to partition the remaining 6 vertices into two scalene triangles (verified by checking step sizes and disjointness). Each partition has three distinct parts (two triangles, one singleton), and assigning three distinct colors (red, green, blue) to these parts gives 3! = 6 colorings per partition. Thus, N₁ = 7 × 6 = 42. Then m = N₁ + 1968 = 42 + 1968 = 2010.\\n\\nProblem 2: The sequence Sₖ is defined with S₀ = 0 and aᵢ = 1 if Sᵢ₋₁ < i, else -1. Zeros of Sₖ occur at k = 3, 12, 39, 120, 363, 1092, 3279, etc., following the recurrence kₙ₊₁ = 3kₙ + 3. The largest k ≤ 2010 in this sequence is 1092, as the next zero (3279) exceeds 2010.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2010\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1092\"\n}",
