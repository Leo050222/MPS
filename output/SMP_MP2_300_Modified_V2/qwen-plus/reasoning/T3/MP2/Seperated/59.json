If Jude continues flipping forever, let $p$ be the probability that he flips 3 heads in a row at some point. Compute $\\lfloor 180 p\\rfloor$. Instead of computing the floor of 180 times the probability of eventually flipping three heads in a row, simply find $\\delta = p_5 - \\frac{53}{72}$, where $p_5$ is the probability that the fifth head is preceded by a tail and that no three consecutive heads have occurred in the sequence up to the fifth head, as derived from analyzing the process to avoid three consecutive heads."

Using dynamic programming to track the probability of sequences with n heads and streaks (1 or 2), we define A(n) as the probability the nth head is preceded by a tail (streak 1) and B(n) as the probability it is part of a streak of 2. The recurrence relations are A(n) = [A(n-1) + B(n-1)] * q_{n-1} and B(n) = A(n-1) * p_{n-1}, where p_k = 1/(k+2) and q_k = (k+1)/(k+2). Starting with A(1)=1, B(1)=0, we compute up to n=5. For n=5, A(5) = 53/72, so δ = 53/72 - 53/72 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need to count non-self-intersecting concave quadrilaterals with vertices (0,0), (1,0), and two distinct lattice points (a,b), (c,d) where 0 ≤ a,c ≤ 59 and 1 ≤ b,d ≤ 5. A quadrilateral is concave if one of the upper points (b,d ≥ 1) lies inside the triangle formed by the other three points. For two points above the x-axis, concavity occurs when one point is inside the triangle formed by (0,0), (1,0), and the other point. The number of such pairs is calculated by considering all combinations of y-coordinates (b,d) where b < d (10 pairs) and counting valid (a,c) pairs for each. Each pair (b,d) contributes 60*59 valid (a,c) pairs (since x ranges 0-59), leading to 10 * 60*59 = 35400 concave quadrilaterals.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"35400\"\n}",
