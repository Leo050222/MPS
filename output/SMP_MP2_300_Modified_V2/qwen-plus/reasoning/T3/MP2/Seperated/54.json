Instead of computing the value of the function at the specified argument, simply find $k = f(68) - 730$, where $f(68)$ is the intermediate value of the function obtained by applying the recursive relation to reach the target argument."

For $n=68$, binary is $1000100_2$, which translates to $1 \\\\cdot 3^6 + 0 \\\\cdot 3^5 + 0 \\\\cdot 3^4 + 0 \\\\cdot 3^3 + 1 \\\\cdot 3^2 + 0 \\\\cdot 3^1 + 0 \\\\cdot 3^0 = 729 + 9 = 738$. Thus, $k = f(68) - 730 = 738 - 730 = 8$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The cube graph is bipartite with partitions of size 4 (even and odd Hamming weights). Counting independent sets involves summing over subsets of one partition and valid subsets of the other. Using bipartite structure and neighborhood analysis, the total number of valid colorings (independent sets) is 35.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"8\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"35\"\n}",
