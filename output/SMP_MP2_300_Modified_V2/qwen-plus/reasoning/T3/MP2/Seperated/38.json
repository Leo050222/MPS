He repeats this action until there are equal numbers of white and black socks remaining. Suppose that the probability he stops before all socks are gone is $p$. If the sum of all distinct possible values of $p$ over all initial combinations of socks is $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$ Instead of computing the sum of all distinct possible values of the stopping probability over all initial combinations of socks, simply find $e = p_{10} + \\frac{38324}{19}$, where $p_{10}$ is the stopping probability when the drawer initially contains an equal number of white and black socks."

After the first sock is thrown away, the state becomes (9,10) or (10,9). Using the formula for the probability of stopping before all socks are gone in such a process, $ f(w, b) = \\\\frac{2 \\\\min(w, b)}{w + b} $, we find $ f(9, 10) = \\\\frac{18}{19} $. Thus $ p_{10} = \\\\frac{18}{19} $. Adding $ \\\\frac{38324}{19} $ gives $ \\\\frac{18 + 38324}{19} = \\\\frac{38342}{19} = 2018 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: This is a Markov chain problem where the expected time to reach 0 frogs on the shore (all in the pool) starting from 1 frog on the shore with $ N = 2019 $ total frogs follows the pattern $ 2^N - 1 $. Verified with small cases (e.g., $ N=2 $ gives 3, $ N=3 $ gives 7), the expected time is $ 2^{2019} - 1 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2018\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2^{2019} - 1\"\n}",
