Since 8 = 2^3 and 125 = 5^3 are coprime, gcd(8,125) = 1. Thus, d = 1 + 0 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find the largest n such that 2^n divides 7^2048 - 1, we use the Lifting The Exponent (LTE) lemma for p=2. For odd integers x and y where x ≡ y mod 2 but x ≢ y mod 4, and even n, v_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2(x - y) + v_2(x + y) + v_2(n) - 1. Here, x=7, y=1, n=2048. v_2(7-1)=1, v_2(7+1)=3, v_2(2048)=11. Thus, v_2(7^2048 - 1) = 1 + 3 + 11 - 1 = 14.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"14\"\n}",
