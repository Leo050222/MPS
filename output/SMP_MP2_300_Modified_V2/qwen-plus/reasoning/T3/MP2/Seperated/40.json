Setting $b = g$ (since $g$ divides $b$), we get $a = g + 120$. For $\\\\gcd(a, b) = g$, $g$ must divide 120. The largest divisor of 120 is 120, giving $a = 240$, $b = c = 120$. The problem asks for $k = \\\\gcd(\\\\text{largest}, \\\\text{smaller}) - \\\\text{smaller} = \\\\gcd(240, 120) - 120 = 120 - 120 = 0$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let arithmetic sequence $a_n = A + (n-1)D$ and geometric sequence $g_n = G r^{n-1}$. Using the given terms:\\n- $n=1$: $A + G = 0 \\\\Rightarrow A = -G$\\n- $n=2$: $A + D + Gr = 0 \\\\Rightarrow D = G(1 - r)$\\n- $n=3$: $A + 2D + Gr^2 = 1 \\\\Rightarrow G(r-1)^2 = 1$\\n- $n=4$: $A + 3D + Gr^3 = 0 \\\\Rightarrow r^3 - 3r + 2 = 0$, solving gives $r = -2$ (since $r=1$ is invalid). Then $G = 1/9$, $A = -1/9$, $D = 1/3$. The 10th term is $a_{10} + g_{10} = (-1/9 + 9 \\\\cdot 1/3) + (1/9)(-2)^9 = 26/9 - 512/9 = -54$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-54\"\n}",
