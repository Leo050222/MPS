  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The equation involves square roots. Squaring both sides leads to the conclusion that the product of the inner expressions of the first two square roots must be zero. Since the first inner expression (2 + AC + 2Cx) is always positive for positive x, the second inner expression (AC - 2 + 2Ax) must be zero. Thus, b = 0, so k = b + 5 = 5.\\n\\nProblem 2: Analyzing modulo 4 shows x must be even. Factoring 3^x - z^2 = 5^y as (3^{x/2} - z)(3^{x/2} + z) = 5^y, both factors must be powers of 5. Solving 2*3^{x/2} = 5^a + 5^b with a < b and coprime factors leads to a=0, d=1, giving x=2, y=1, z=2. Checking small values and modular constraints confirms this is the only solution in positive integers.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(2,1,2)\"\n}",
