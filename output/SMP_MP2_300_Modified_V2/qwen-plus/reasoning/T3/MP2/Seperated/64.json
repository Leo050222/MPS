For $1 \\leq i \\leq 6$, let $C_{i}$ be a unit circle centered at $P_{i}$ and $\\ell_{i}$ be one of the internal common tangents of $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+2}$, where $C_{7}=C_{1}$ and $C_{8}=C_{2}$. Assume that the lines $\\{\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}, \\ell_{5}, \\ell_{6}\\}$ bound a regular hexagon. The area of this hexagon can be expressed as $\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of determining the value 100 times the numerator plus the denominator for the area of the bounded regular hexagon when expressed as the square root of a reduced fraction, simply find $e = k + 1986$, where $k$ is the denominator of that reduced fraction."
