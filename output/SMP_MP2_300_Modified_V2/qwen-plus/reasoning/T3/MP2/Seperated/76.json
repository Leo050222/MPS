By eliminating variables, we find 14b ≡ 1 mod m and 14a ≡ 87 mod m. Testing small values, we find a = 27, b = 7 satisfies the congruences with modulus m = 97. Thus, ℓ = m - 95 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: The quadrilateral has AB + CD = BC + DA = 7, so it is tangential. The maximum area for a tangential quadrilateral with given sides occurs when it is cyclic (Brahmagupta's formula). The semiperimeter s = 7, and the area K = √[(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)] = √(5×4×2×3) = 2√30. The inradius r = K/s = 2√30/7.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\\\\sqrt{30}/7\"\n}",
