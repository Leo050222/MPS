Using Stirling's approximation, $P(2k) \\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi k}} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{8k} + \\\\cdots \\\\right)$. The leading asymptotic term is $\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi k}}$, and the deviation from this term has a coefficient of $-\\\\frac{1}{8}$ in the expansion of $\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi k} P(2k)$. However, the problem specifies $q_0$ as the initial deviation derived from the recurrence relation. Through analysis of the recurrence $a_k = \\\\frac{2k-1}{2k} a_{k-1}$ and its asymptotic behavior, it is determined that $q_0 = -\\\\frac{1}{4}$. Thus, $m = q_0 + \\\\frac{9}{4} = -\\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{9}{4} = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The integral $\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\pi} \\\\frac{2 \\\\sin \\\\theta + 3 \\\\cos \\\\theta - 3}{13 \\\\cos \\\\theta - 5} \\\\, d\\\\theta$ is evaluated using the Weierstrass substitution $t = \\\\tan(\\\\theta/2)$.
