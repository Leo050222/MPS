The sum of the possible values of $r$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100a+b$. Instead of computing the numerical value obtained by multiplying the numerator by 100 and adding the denominator of the reduced fractional representation of the sum of the possible parameter values, simply find $m = b - 4$, where $b$ is that denominator."

Subtracting the quadratics gives $(r + 2)\\\\alpha + 16 = 0$, so $\\\\alpha = -\\\\frac{16}{r + 2}$ (for $r \\\\neq -2$). Substituting into the first quadratic and simplifying leads to $5r^2 - 4r - 156 = 0$. The sum of roots is $\\\\frac{4}{5}$, so $a = 4$, $b = 5$. The problem asks for $m = b - 4 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using the 2-adic valuation and factorization, $3^{512} - 1$ factors into terms where each $3^{2^k} + 1$ for $k \\\\geq 1$ has $v_2 = 1$, $3 + 1$ has $v_2 = 2$, and $3 - 1$ has $v_2 = 1$. Summing valuations: $1 + 2 + 8 \\\\times 1 = 11$. Thus, the largest $n$ is 11.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
