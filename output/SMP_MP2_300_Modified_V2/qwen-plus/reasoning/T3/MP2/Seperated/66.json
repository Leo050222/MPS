However, the two dice are not fair, meaning that they can land on each face with different probability. Marisa rolls the two dice and calculates their sum. Given that the sum is 2 with probability 0.04, and 12 with probability 0.01, the maximum possible probability of the sum being 7 is $p$. Compute $\\lfloor 100 p\\rfloor$."

Thus, $a = \\\\frac{r^2}{r - 1}$. For $a$ to be a positive integer, $r - 1$ must divide $r^2$. Using polynomial division, $r^2 = (r - 1)(r + 1) + 1$, so $\\\\frac{r^2}{r - 1} = r + 1 + \\\\frac{1}{r - 1}$. This implies $r - 1$ divides 1, so $r - 1 = \\\\pm 1$. For $r = 2$, $a = 4$ (valid positive integer). For $r = 0$, $a = 0$ (invalid as $a$ must be positive). Negative $r$ leads to negative $a$, which is invalid. Thus, the only valid $a$ is 4. Therefore, $k = a + 7 = 11$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let $p_i$ be the probability of rolling $i$ on each die. Given $P(\\\\text{sum}=2) = p_1^2 = 0.04$, so $p_1 = 0.2$. Similarly, $P(\\\\text{sum}=12) = p_6^2 = 0.01$, so $p_6 = 0.1$. The probability of sum 7 is $2(p_1 p_6 + p_2 p_5 + p_3 p_4)$. To maximize this, we maximize $p_2 p_5 + p_3 p_4$ under $p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 0.7$. By AM-GM, the maximum of $xy + zw$ given $x + y + z + w = S$ is $(S/2)^2$, achieved when one pair sums to $S$ and the other pair is zero. Here $S = 0.7$, so maximum $p_2 p_5 + p_3 p_4 = (0.7/2)^2 = 0.1225$. Thus, $P(\\\\text{sum}=7) = 2(0.2 \\\\cdot 0.1 + 0.1225) = 0.285$. Then $\\\\lfloor 100 \\\\cdot 0.285 \\\\rfloor = 28$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"28\"\n}",
