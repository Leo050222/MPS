Then m = 86 - 36 = 50.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let X be the number of distinct absolute values in a random 50-element subset T of S. Using linearity of expectation, E[X] = E[X_0] + sum_{k=1}^{100} E[X_k]. For X_0 (absolute value 0), probability 0 is in T is 50/201. For each k ≥ 1, probability at least one of ±k is in T is 1 - C(199,50)/C(201,50) = 117/268.
