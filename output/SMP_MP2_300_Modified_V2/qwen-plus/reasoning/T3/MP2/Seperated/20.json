The volume gives Area(BCD) = 3/h. For triangle BCD, Area = (BC·CD·DB)/(4r) = 16/(4r) = 4/r, where r is the circumradius of BCD. Thus, 3/h = 4/r ⇒ r = 4h/3. Since AB² = h² + r², substituting r gives 4 = h² + (16h²)/9 ⇒ 25h² = 36 ⇒ h = 6/5. Then δ = h - 7/10 = 6/5 - 7/10 = 1/2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Count integer pairs (x,y) such that (x+1/2, y+1/2) is in the interior of triangle ABC with A=(0,0), B=(200,100), C=(30,330). The area of ABC is 31500. Using Pick's Theorem for the half-integer lattice, the number of interior points is Area - B/2, where B is boundary points on the lattice. Boundary points: 30 on AC (x=0 to 29), 10 on BC (solutions to 23x + 17y = 6280), total B=40. Thus, interior points = 31500 - 40/2 = 31480.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"31480\"\n}",
