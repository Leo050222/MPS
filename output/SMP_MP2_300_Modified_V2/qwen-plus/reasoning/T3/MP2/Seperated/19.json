Using coordinate geometry with D at (0,0), B(-3,0), C(7,0), A(0,h) where h = AD = (12/7)x. The orthocenter H lies on the altitude from A (y-axis) at (0, k) where k = HD = x. The altitude from B to AC has slope 7/h (since AC has slope -h/7), and passes through B(-3,0), so its equation is y = (7/h)(x + 3). At x=0, y = 21/h, which is the y-coordinate of H, so k = 21/h. Substituting h = (12/7)k gives k = 21 / ((12/7)k) => 4k² = 49 => k = 7/2. Thus HD = 7/2, so m = HD - 3/2 = 7/2 - 3/2 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Each term (n³ - 1)/(n³ + 1) factors as [(n-1)(n² + n + 1)] / [(n+1)(n² - n + 1)].
