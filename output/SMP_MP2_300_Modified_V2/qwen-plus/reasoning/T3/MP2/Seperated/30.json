Instead of finding the sum of the unique positive integers $n_1$ through $n_6$, simply find $k = n_3 - 299$, where $n_3$ is the subscript of the Fibonacci number with coefficient $10$ in the linear combination."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The sum involves five indices each from 0 to 100, summing Fibonacci numbers of their total. Using the Binet formula $F_n = \\\\frac{\\\\phi^n - \\\\psi^n}{\\\\sqrt{5}}$ where $\\\\phi = \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $\\\\psi = \\\\frac{1-\\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, the multiple sum becomes a combination of geometric series. The generating function for each index sum $\\\\sum_{i=0}^{100} x^i = \\\\frac{x^{101} - 1}{x - 1}$ simplifies using $\\\\phi - 1 = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\phi}$ to $\\\\phi^{102} - \\\\phi$ for $x = \\\\phi$. Raising this to the 5th power and expanding via the binomial theorem gives coefficients matching the problem's linear combination. The exponents for $F_{n_3}$ (coefficient 10) is 308, so $k = 308 - 299 = 9$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let $\\\\alpha = \\\\tan^{-1}(x/9)$ and $\\\\beta = \\\\tan^{-1}(x/16)$. Using the sine subtraction formula, $\\\\sin(\\\\alpha - \\\\beta) = \\\\frac{7x}{\\\\sqrt{(x^2 + 81)(x^2 + 256)}}$. Maximizing this expression by setting $t = x^2$ and finding critical points yields $t = 144$ (i.e., $x = 12$). Substituting back gives the maximum value $\\\\frac{7}{25}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7/25\"\n}",
