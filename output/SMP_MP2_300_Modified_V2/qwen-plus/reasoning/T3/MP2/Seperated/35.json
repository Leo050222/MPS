      "A745": "Alice is sitting in a teacup ride with infinitely many layers of spinning disks. The largest disk has radius 5. Each succeeding disk has its center attached to a point on the circumference of the previous disk and has a radius equal to $2 / 3$ of the previous disk. Each disk spins around its center (relative to the disk it is attached to) at a rate of \\pi / 6$ radians per second. Initially, at $t=0$, the centers of the disks are aligned on a single line, going outward. Alice is sitting at the limit point of all these disks. After 12 seconds, what is the length of the trajectory that Alice has traced out? Instead of computing the total path length traversed by the limit point, simply find $k = r - 7$, where $r$ is the radius of the trajectory traced by that limit point."

      "A1550": "The number 770 is written on a blackboard. Melody repeatedly performs moves, where a move consists of subtracting either 40 or 41 from the number on the board. She performs moves until the number is not positive, and then she stops. Let $N$ be the number of sequences of moves that Melody could perform. Suppose $N=a \\cdot 2^{b}$ where $a$ is an odd positive integer and $b$ is a nonnegative integer. Compute $100 a+b$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The trajectory of Alice is modeled as a complex function. The position is the sum of an infinite geometric series of rotating vectors. Simplifying the series shows the trajectory is a circle with center (6, 0) and radius 9. Thus, r = 9, so k = r - 7 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of sequences is determined by counting valid combinations of subtracting 40 or 41 from 770 until non-positive. Valid sequences occur for k=19 and k=20 moves. For k=19, total sequences are 2^18. For k=20, total sequences are 2^19. Summing gives N = 3 * 2^18. Thus, a=3, b=18, so 100a + b = 318.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"318\"\n}",
