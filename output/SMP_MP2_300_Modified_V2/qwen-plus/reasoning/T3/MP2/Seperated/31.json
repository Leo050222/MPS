If each player chooses their roles randomly, what is the probability that each role will have exactly two players? Instead of computing the probability that every role is selected by precisely two players, simply find $e = T(favorable) - 1940$, where $T(favorable)$ is the total number of favorable outcomes where each role receives exactly two choices."

This is a known combinatorial value from OEIS sequence A001499, which gives 2040 for n=5. Thus, T(favorable) = 2040. Calculating e = 2040 - 1940 = 100.\\n\\nProblem 2: The function ||k|| represents the absolute difference between k and the nearest perfect square. By analyzing intervals between consecutive squares and summing ||k|| values, we find that the cumulative sum up to n follows a specific pattern. Solving for the smallest n where the average equals 100 leads to n = 89800, verified by quadratic solution within the interval for m=299.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"89800\"\n}",
