On a chessboard, a 5x5 square has 13 black squares if its top-left corner's coordinates sum to even (assuming standard coloring), otherwise 12. The probability depends on the number of starting positions (n = k - 4 per dimension). For n odd, the probability of more black squares is (n² - 1)/(2n²). Setting this equal to 0.48 gives n² = 25, so n = 5. Thus, b = n - 3 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Rewrite the equation as 3^x 4^y = 2^{x+y} + 2^{2(x+y)-1}. Let s = x + y. Testing small integer values and analyzing the equation shows solutions when (x, y) = (0, 1), (1, 1), and (2, 2). These satisfy the equation, and no other integer pairs work after checking all cases.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2)\"\n}",
