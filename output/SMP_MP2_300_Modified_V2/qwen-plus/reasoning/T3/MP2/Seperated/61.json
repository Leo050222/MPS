You continue this until you have 8 pieces of chalk. What is the probability that they all have length $\\frac{1}{8}$ ? Instead of determining the probability that the final pieces are all of equal length, simply find $e = \\binom{6}{3} - 16$, where $\\binom{6}{3}$ is the number of ways to interleave the remaining breaks equally between the two subpieces created by the first break."

Calculating $ \\\\binom{6}{3} = \\\\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20 $, so $ e = 20 - 16 = 4 $. \\n\\nProblem 2: For the quartic polynomial $ Q(x) = x^4 - kx^3 - x^2 - x - 45 $ to be quirky, one root must equal the sum of the other three. Using Vieta's formulas and assuming $ r_4 = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 $, we derive the equation $ k^4 + 4k^2 + 8k + 720 = 0 $. The product of the roots of this quartic (the four values of $ k $) is the constant term $ 720 $, as it is a monic polynomial.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"720\"\n}",
