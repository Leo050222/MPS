  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To find k = p(1) + 1, we first compute the tangent line approximation to f(t) = t/(t³ + 8) at t=1. The tangent line L(t) is f(1) + f’(1)(t - 1). Calculating f(1) = 1/9 and f’(1) = 2/27, we get L(t) = (2t + 1)/27. The difference L(t) - f(t) has a numerator polynomial p(t) = (2t + 1)(t³ + 8) - 27t = 2t⁴ + t³ - 11t + 8. Evaluating p(1) gives 0, so k = 0 + 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The equation xⁿ - yⁿ = 2¹⁰⁰ requires factoring as (x - y)(xⁿ⁻¹ + ... + yⁿ⁻¹) = 2¹⁰⁰. For n > 1, both factors must be powers of 2. For n=2, this reduces to (x - y)(x + y) = 2¹⁰⁰, with x - y = 2ᵃ and x + y = 2ᵇ where a + b = 100 and a < b. Valid solutions occur for a = 1 to 49 (49 solutions). For n ≥ 3, no solutions exist due to parity and Mihăilescu's theorem constraints. Thus, only 49 ordered triples exist.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"49\"\n}",
