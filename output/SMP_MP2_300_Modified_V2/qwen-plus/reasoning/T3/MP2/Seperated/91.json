Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of computing the encoded value $100a + 10b + c$ from the parameters of the distance expression, simply find $d = \\gcd(a, c) + 0$, where $a, b, c$ are the positive integers such that the distance is $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$ with $b$ square-free and $\\gcd(a, c)=1$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To find the distance from vertex A to face BCD in tetrahedron ABCD, we use the volume formula. First, compute the area of triangle BCD with sides BC=10, CD=10, BD=6√2. Using coordinates, B=(0,0,0), D=(6√2,0,0), C=(3√2,√82,0), the area is 6√41. Next, assign coordinates to A=(3√2, q, r) satisfying AB=6, AC=8, AD=6. Solving gives r=24/√41, so the distance is 24√41/41. Here, a=24, b=41, c=41 with gcd(24,41)=1. The problem asks for d = gcd(a,c) + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Factor 3x² + 10xy + 3y² = (3x + y)(x + 3y). For this to be a prime power, both factors must be powers of the same prime. Only prime p=2 works.
