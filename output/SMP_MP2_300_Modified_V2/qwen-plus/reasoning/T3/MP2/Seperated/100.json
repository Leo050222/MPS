She takes off in some direction in a straight path. She moves \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}$ units before crossing a circle, then \\sqrt{5}$ units, then \\frac{3 \\sqrt{5}}{5}$ units. What distance will she travel before she crosses another circle? Instead of determining the distance before crossing another circle, simply find $k = d - 6$, where $d$ is the distance to the next circle crossing derived from the geometric analysis of the straight-line trajectory relative to the concentric circles."

Given the first three crossing distances, we determine the perpendicular distance from the origin to the path is $ \\\\sqrt{44/5} $. The next crossing at radius 6 gives the distance $ d = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{136} - 9}{\\\\sqrt{5}} $. Simplifying $ k = d - 6 $ yields $ -\\\\frac{24}{5} $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find restricted paths from (0,0) to (7,3), we use dynamic programming. Define $ dp[i][j] $ as the number of paths to (i,j). The restriction implies if the $ i $-th step is up, the next must be right. This leads to recurrence relations considering the last step. After computing all states, the result is 120.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"-24/5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"120\"\n}",
