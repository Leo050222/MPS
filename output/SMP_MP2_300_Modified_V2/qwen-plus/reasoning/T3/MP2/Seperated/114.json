  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Analyzing the equation modulo 3, primes (except 3) have squares ≡1 mod 3. The RHS is 1 mod 3. For LHS to equal RHS, exactly two of a, b, c must be 3 (to get 0+0+1=1 mod 3). Considering the case where a=3, b=3 (so c≠3), the equation simplifies to 16c² + 17 = 9k². Factoring as (3k - 4c)(3k + 4c) = 17 (prime), solving gives c=2 (prime). Thus, m = c + 288 = 290.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of trailing zeros in n! is given by Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + floor(n/625). Testing values, Z(1170) = 234 + 46 + 9 + 1 = 290. Checking smaller n (e.g., 1169) gives Z=289, so 1170 is the smallest n.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"290\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1170\"\n}",
