Compute Q(r) = (-1)² + 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2. Then k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Suppose such an irrational α > 1 exists. For all n ≥ 1, floor(αⁿ) must be divisible by 2017, implying αⁿ ∈ [2017kₙ, 2017kₙ + 1) for integers kₙ. Let γ = α/2017 > 1. Then γⁿ ∈ [kₙ, kₙ + 1/2017), meaning the fractional part of γⁿ is less than 1/2017 for all n. However, for irrational γ > 1, Diophantine approximation theory shows that fractional parts {γⁿ} cannot all be arbitrarily small (e.g., Pisano numbers have {γⁿ} → 0 but not uniformly bounded by 1/2017 for all n). Additionally, if γ were rational, α would be rational, contradicting the requirement. Thus, no such irrational α exists.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
