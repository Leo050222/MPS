Substituting gives $k^5 + n^5 = 16kn$. Testing small values, $k = 2$, $n = 2$ satisfies the equation: $2^5 + 2^5 = 64 = 16 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 2$. Thus, $(m, n) = (-2, 2)$ is the only solution with opposite signs where $n$ is positive. Hence, $k = n - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given polynomial $x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48$ with roots $p < q < r$, we use Vieta's formulas: $pqr = 48$. To minimize $\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$, we consider integer factorizations of 48. Testing triplets, $(2, 4, 6)$ yields $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{3}{2}$. Using Lagrange multipliers confirms this is the minimum, as the critical point occurs at $p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
