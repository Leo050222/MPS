Each block rests on 4 smaller blocks, each with dimensions half those of the larger block. Laura removes blocks one at a time from this stack, removing only blocks that currently have no blocks on top of them. Find the number of ways Laura can remove precisely 5 blocks from Manya's stack (the order in which they are removed matters)."

For this product to be prime, one factor must be 1. Solving $a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2 = 1$ gives $(a - b)^2 + b^2 = 1$, which holds only for $a = b = 1$. Substituting yields $1^4 + 4(1)^4 = 5$, a prime. Thus, $m = 5$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The stack is a 4-ary tree with 4 layers. Removal order must respect dependencies (a block can only be removed after its parent). The first block must be the root (layer 1). Analyzing cases based on the number of layer 2 blocks removed (t = 1 to 4):\\n- t=1: 1056 sequences\\n- t=2: 3168 sequences\\n- t=3: 864 sequences\\n- t=4: 24 sequences\\nTotal: 1056 + 3168 + 864 + 24 = 5112.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"5112\"\n}",
