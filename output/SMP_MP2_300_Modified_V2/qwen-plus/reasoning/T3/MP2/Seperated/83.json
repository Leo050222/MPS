Let the two circles intersect at $A$ and $B$, and let the tangents to $\\omega_{2}$ at $A$ and $B$ intersect at $P$. If the area of $\\triangle ABP$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $b$ is square-free and $a, c$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a+10b+c$. Instead of computing the encoded integer from the parameters in the simplified expression for the area of $\\triangle ABP$, simply find $m = c - 22$, where $c$ is the denominator in that fractional expression derived from the geometric configuration of the circles and tangents."

The tangents from P to ω₂ form a triangle ABP where P lies on the line through the centers. Coordinates show P is at (-5, 0), and the area of △ABP is 192√6/25. Here, c = 25, so m = c - 22 = 3.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a 2×n grid with 3 colors and no adjacent same colors, the recurrence relation is f(n) = 3·f(n-1) with f(1) = 6. Thus, f(n) = 2·3ⁿ. For n = 2008, the number of colorings is 2·3²⁰⁰⁸.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2*3^2008\"\n}",
