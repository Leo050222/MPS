  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We analyze the Diophantine equation $3p^4 - 5q^4 - 4r^2 = 26$ for prime triples $(p, q, r)$. By considering parity and modular arithmetic (mod 3), we deduce $q$ must be 3 (the only prime satisfying the congruence conditions). Substituting $q = 3$, the equation simplifies to $3p^4 - 4r^2 = 431$. Testing small primes for $p$, we find $p = 5$ yields $r^2 = 361$, so $r = 19$ (a prime). Verifying, $3(5)^4 - 5(3)^4 - 4(19)^2 = 26$ holds. Thus, $r = 19$, and $m = r - 16 = 3$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let the triangle sides be $a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c$ with perimeter 1. The altitudes are proportional to $1/a, 1/b, 1/c$. For these to form a triangle, the critical inequality is $1/b + 1/c > 1/a$. Using $b + c = 1 - a$ and AM-GM, the maximum product $bc$ occurs when $b = c$, leading to $a > 1/5$. The smallest side $a$ must also satisfy $a \\\\leq 1/3$ (as the smallest side in a triangle with perimeter 1). Thus, the set of possible values for $\\\\min(AB, BC, CA)$ is $(1/5, 1/3]$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(1/5, 1/3]\"\n}",
