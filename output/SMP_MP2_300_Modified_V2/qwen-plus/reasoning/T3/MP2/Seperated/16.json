Ace through 10 are worth 1 to 10 points respectively, and the face cards King, Queen, and Jack are each worth 10 points. The probability that the sum of the point values of the cards drawn is a multiple of 10 can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing a hundred times the numerator plus the denominator of the fraction representing the probability in lowest terms, simply find $k = d + 0$, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that probability fraction."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability that the sum of three card values (with replacement) is a multiple of 10 is calculated using generating functions and roots of unity. The probability simplifies to 244/2197, which is in lowest terms (gcd(244, 2197) = 1). The problem instructs to find k = d + 0 where d is the gcd of numerator and denominator. Since the fraction is reduced, d = 1, so k = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The functional equation P(2x)/P(x+1) = 8x/(x+7) leads to determining P(x) as a cubic polynomial. Solving for coefficients using P(1) = 1 gives P(x) = (1/21)x(x+6)(x+2). Evaluating at x = -1 yields P(-1) = -5/21.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-5/21\"\n}",
