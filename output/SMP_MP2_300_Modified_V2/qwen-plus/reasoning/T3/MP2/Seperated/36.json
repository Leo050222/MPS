A perfectutation is a bijective function $h$ from $S$ to itself such that there exists an $a \\in S$ such that $h(a) \\neq a$, and that for any pair of integers $a \\in S$ and $b \\in S$ such that $h(a) \\neq a, h(b) \\neq b$, there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $h^{k}(a)=b$. Let $n$ be the number of ordered pairs of perfectutations $(f, g)$ such that $f(g(i))=g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in S$, but $f \\neq g$. Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by 2011 . Instead of determining the remainder when the number of ordered pairs of distinct commuting perfectutations is divided by the prime, simply find $m = p - 2010$, where $p$ is that prime."

Since 2011 is the prime, m = 2011 - 2010 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: For n ≥ 4, the triple (1,3,4) requires |X₁ ∪ X₃ ∪ X₄| = ⌈√(12)⌉ = 4. However, from (1,2,3) and (1,2,4), both unions have size 3, implying X₃ and X₄ are subsets of a 3-element set S = X₁ ∪ X₂ ∪ X₃. Thus, X₁ ∪ X₃ ∪ X₄ ⊆ S, which has size ≤ 3, contradicting the required size 4. For n=3, it's possible (e.g., X₁={1}, X₂={2}, X₃={3} with union size 3 = ⌈√6⌉). Hence, the largest n is 3.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
