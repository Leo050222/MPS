Let $ r = P(1) $, $ s = P(2) $. Then $ r + s = -b $ and $ rs = c $. Solving $ r = 1 + b + c $, $ s = 4 + 2b + c $, and substituting into $ r + s = -b $ gives $ 2b + c = -\\\\frac{5}{2} $. Substituting into $ rs = c $ yields $ b = -\\\\frac{1}{2} $, $ c = -\\\\frac{3}{2} $. Thus, $ k = c + \\\\frac{4037}{2} = \\\\frac{4034}{2} = 2017 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need $ N > 2017 $ such that exactly 40% of numbers from 1 to $ N $ have leftmost digit 1. The count $ C(N) $ of such numbers satisfies $ C(N) = 0.4N $. For $ N $ in $ [10^6, 1999999] $, $ C(N) = N - 888888 $. Solving $ N - 888888 = 0.4N $ gives $ N = 1481480 $, which is the smallest $ N > 2017 $ satisfying the condition.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2017\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1481480\"\n}",
