After they finish construction, it turns out that each city can reach exactly 3 other cities via a single road, and from any pair of distinct cities, either exactly 0 or 2 other cities can be reached from both cities by a single road. Compute the number of ways HMMTLand could have constructed the roads. Instead of computing the total number of possible road constructions satisfying the conditions, simply find $e = N - 833$, where $N$ is the number of connected road constructions satisfying the conditions."

The only such connected graph is the 3-cube (Q3). The number of labeled copies of Q3 is calculated by dividing the total permutations of 8 vertices by the size of its automorphism group (48), giving 8! / 48 = 840. The problem asks for e = N - 833, where N is the number of connected constructions, so e = 840 - 833 = 7.\\n\\nProblem 2: For √x, √(x+7), and √(10−x) to form a non-degenerate triangle, the triangle inequalities must hold. The critical inequalities reduce to solving when the sum of the two smaller sides exceeds the largest side. This leads to the valid interval for x being (1/5, 9). The length of this interval is 44/5, and the total interval length is 10, so the probability is (44/5)/10 = 22/25.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"7\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"22/25\"\n}",
