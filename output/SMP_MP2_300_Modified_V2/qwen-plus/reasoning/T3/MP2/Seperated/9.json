      "A1734": "Six men and their wives are sitting at a round table with 12 seats. These men and women are very jealous - no man will allow his wife to sit next to any man except for himself, and no woman will allow her husband to sit next to any woman except for herself. In how many distinct ways can these 12 people be seated such that these conditions are satisfied? Instead of determining the total number of distinct valid seating arrangements under the jealousy conditions, simply find $k = N_3 - 2879$, where $N_3$ is the number of such arrangements in the configuration consisting of six alternating blocks of exactly two persons of the same gender each, derived from the block decomposition analysis of the seating constraints."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The problem requires finding $ N_3 $, the number of valid seating arrangements with six alternating blocks of two same-gender individuals (three MM blocks and three WW blocks) under jealousy conditions. The key insight is that the jealousy conditions enforce a cyclic permutation of the six men, where each man's right neighbor in an MM block determines the placement of his wife in the adjacent WW block. For circular arrangements, fixing one man's position to account for rotational symmetry leaves $ (6-1)! = 120 $ distinct arrangements. Thus, $ N_3 = 120 $. Calculating $ k = N_3 - 2879 $ gives $ 120 - 2879 = -2759 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The series is $ \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{(k+2)^2 + k} $. Simplifying the denominator gives $ (k+1)(k+4) $. Using partial fractions, $ \\\\frac{1}{(k+1)(k+4)} = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{k+1} - \\\\frac{1}{k+4} \\\\right) $. This telescopes to $ \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{13}{36} $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"-2759\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"13/36\"\n}",
