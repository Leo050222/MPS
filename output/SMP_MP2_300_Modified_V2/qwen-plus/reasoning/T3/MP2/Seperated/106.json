Instead of finding the area of the triangle, simply find $k = x - 3$, where $x$ is the scaling factor such that the side lengths are $5x$ for the longest side, $4x$ for the middle-length side, and $3x$ for the shortest side."

The reciprocals of the altitudes (12, 15, 20) are 1/12, 1/15, 1/20, which simplify to the ratio 5:4:3. Thus, the sides are 5x, 4x, 3x. Since the triangle is a right triangle (3-4-5), its area is (3x)(4x)/2 = 6x². Using the altitude formula, area = 30x (from 2A = 12*5x). Equating 6x² = 30x gives x = 5. Thus, k = x - 3 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let S = a² + b² and t = 10/S. The equations become a + tb = 5 and b + ta = 4. Solving the linear system and substituting S = 10/t leads to a quartic equation in t. Factoring reveals solutions t = 1/2, 2, (4±3i)/5. Back-substituting gives the ordered pairs (4, 2), (1, 2), (5/2, 2 - 3i/2), and (5/2, 2 + 3i/2). All satisfy the original equations and S ≠ 0.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(4, 2), (1, 2), (5/2, 2 - 3i/2), (5/2, 2 + 3i/2)\"\n}",
