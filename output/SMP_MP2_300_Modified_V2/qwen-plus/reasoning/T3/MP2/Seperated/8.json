The point values are as follows: the value of each red card is 1 , the value of each blue card is equal to twice the number of red cards, and the value of each yellow card is equal to three times the number of blue cards. What is the maximum score you can get with fifteen cards?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The chord BC has length 1 in a unit circle. Using the chord length formula, the central angle for BC is 60°, so the inscribed angle subtended by BC (acute angle at A) is 30°. Thus, sin θ = sin 30° = 1/2. Then n = 1/2 + 29/2 = 15.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let R, B, Y be the number of red, blue, yellow cards (R + B + Y = 15). Score S = R + 2RB + 3BY. Substituting Y = 15 - R - B, S = R(1 - B) + 45B - 3B². For B ≥ 2, maximizing S requires R = 0 (since coefficient of R is negative). Then S = 3B(15 - B), a quadratic maximized at B = 7.5. Testing integers B = 7 and B = 8 gives S = 168 in both cases. Other cases (R > 0 or B < 2) yield lower scores. Maximum score is 168.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"15\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"168\"\n}",
