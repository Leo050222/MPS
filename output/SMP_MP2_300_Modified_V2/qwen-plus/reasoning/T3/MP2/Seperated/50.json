      "A1092": "Farmer Bill's 1000 animals - ducks, cows, and rabbits - are standing in a circle. In order to feel safe, every duck must either be standing next to at least one cow or between two rabbits. If there are 600 ducks, what is the least number of cows there can be for this to be possible? Instead of determining the minimal number of cows required, simply find $k = r - 198$, where $r$ is the number of rabbits in the arrangement that achieves this minimum."

With 600 ducks, let $a$ be size-1 blocks and $b$ size-2 blocks: $a + 2b = 600$. Non-duck blocks $m = a + b = 600 - b \\\\leq 400 \\\\Rightarrow b \\\\geq 200$. Setting $b = 200$ (minimal), $m = 400$, so all non-duck blocks are length 1. Size-1 blocks $a = 200$. To satisfy conditions, 198 size-1 blocks are x-type (between rabbits), requiring 198 rabbits, and 2 are y-type. Total rabbits $r = 199$ (198 for x-type + 1 extra to fix circular arrangement). Thus $k = r - 198 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The largest set where every three points include a unit distance pair. A 6-point triangular prism graph (two equilateral triangles connected by edges) is realizable in the plane with all triples containing a unit distance. Adding a 7th point creates a triple with no unit distances. Thus, maximum $n = 6$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
