By computing initial terms and identifying a pattern, we observe that each prime p is repeated for a number of terms determined by the difference between the next prime and the previous prime. Tracking the ranges of terms for each prime, we find that a₉₈=47 (part of the prime 47's range from n=89 to 98) and a₉₉=53 (the first term of the next prime). The sum of these two consecutive terms preceding a₁₀₀ is 47 + 53 = 100.\\n\\nProblem 2: Alice starts at 0 and applies 100 operations (add 1 or square). The goal is to maximize the minimum distance to the nearest perfect square. By strategically using square operations followed by add operations, the optimal strategy involves building up to a number just below a large square and adding enough to reach a point where the minimal distance to the nearest square is maximized. The highest achievable minimal distance is 93, achieved by sequences like adding 3, squaring to 9, adding 1 to 10, squaring to 100, squaring to 10000, and adding 93 to reach 10093 (distance 93 from 100²=10000 and 101²=10201).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"93\"\n}",
