      "A499": "A tightrope walker stands in the center of a rope of length 32 meters. Every minute she walks forward one meter with probability $3 / 4$ and backward one meter with probability $1 / 4$. What is the probability that she reaches the end in front of her before the end behind her? Instead of computing the probability of reaching the forward end before the backward end in this biased random walk on a line, simply find $k = r + 2/3$, where $r$ is the ratio of the backward probability to the forward probability."

He starts at the square labeled 1 and every second walks to an adjacent square. How many paths can Sam take so that the sum of the numbers on every square he visits in his path is equal to 20 (not counting the square he started on)?"

Then k = r + 2/3 = 1/3 + 2/3 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using dynamic programming to track the number of paths where the sum of visited squares (excluding the start) equals 20. Define dp[s][v] as the number of paths ending at position v with sum s. Transitions are based on adjacency in the 2x2 grid (1-2-4-3-1 cycle). After computing up to s=20, the total paths are the sum of dp[20][1] + dp[20][2] + dp[20][3] + dp[20][4] = 74 + 42 + 43 + 31 = 190.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"190\"\n}",
