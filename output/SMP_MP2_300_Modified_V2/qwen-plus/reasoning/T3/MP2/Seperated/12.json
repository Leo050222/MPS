Instead of finding the maximum value of the function over the domain of nonnegative integers up to the given bound, simply find $k = f(100,100) - 97$, where $f(100,100)$ is the value of the function at equal arguments equal to the upper bound derived from the recursive definition."

Thus, f(100, 100) = 101. Calculating k = 101 - 97 gives 4.\\n\\nProblem 2: The intersection points of x⁴ + y⁴ = 100 and xy = 4 are symmetric. Using substitution and algebraic manipulation, we find (x² + y²)² = 132 and (x² - y²)² = 68. The area of the convex quadrilateral formed by these points is calculated using the shoelace formula, resulting in 4√17, which is written as 4sqrt(17) in plain text.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4sqrt(17)\"\n}",
