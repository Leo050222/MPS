Using substitution $y = 1 - x$, the expression simplifies to $2x^4 - 4x^3 + 7x^2 - 5x + 1$. Taking the derivative and finding critical points shows the minimum occurs at $x = y = 1/2$, yielding the value $-1/8$. Adding $\\\\frac{401}{8}$ gives $k = 50$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The condition $\\\\gcd(n^n + 50, n + 1) = 1$ reduces to checking $\\\\gcd(n + 1, (-1)^n + 50) = 1$. For odd $n$, $(-1)^n + 50 = 49$, requiring $\\\\gcd(n + 1, 49) = 1$ (i.e., $7 \\\\nmid n + 1$). For even $n$, $(-1)^n + 50 = 51$, requiring $\\\\gcd(n + 1, 51) = 1$ (i.e., $3, 17 \\\\nmid n + 1$). Using density arguments over $\\\\{1, 2, \\\\ldots, 2023!\\\\}$, the probability is calculated as $\\\\frac{3}{7} + \\\\frac{16}{51} = \\\\frac{265}{357}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"50\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"265/357\"\n}",
