  "math_problem": "Find all positive integers $a,b$ for which $a^4+4b^4$ is a prime number. Instead of finding all positive integer pairs that make the given expression prime, simply find $m$, the prime number equal to that expression. Manya has a stack of $85=1+4+16+64$ blocks comprised of 4 layers (the $k$ th layer from the top has $4^{k-1}$ blocks). Each block rests on 4 smaller blocks, each with dimensions half those of the larger block. Laura removes blocks one at a time from this stack, removing only blocks that currently have no blocks on top of them. Find the number of ways Laura can remove precisely $m$ blocks from Manya's stack (the order in which they are removed matters).",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine the prime number $ m = a^4 + 4b^4 $ for positive integers $ a, b $. Using the **Sophie Germain identity**, we factor:\\n\\n$$\\na^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2)\\n$$\\n\\nFor this product to be prime, one of the factors must equal 1. Since both are positive integers and $ a, b \\\\geq 1 $, the smaller factor is $ a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2 $. Setting it to 1:\\n\\n$$\\n(a - b)^2 + b^2 = 1\\n$$\\n\\nThis equation has only one solution in positive integers: $ b = 1 $, $ a = 1 $. Substituting back gives:\\n\\n$$\\na^4 + 4b^4 = 1 + 4 = 5\\n$$\\n\\nThus, $ m = 5 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\nNext, we analyze the block removal process from Manya's stack. The stack consists of 4 layers with $ 4^{k-1} $ blocks in layer $ k $, totaling $ 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 = 85 $ blocks. Each block rests on 4 smaller blocks below it, forming a **complete 4-ary tree** rooted at the top block.\\n\\nLaura removes blocks **only if no blocks are on top of them**, meaning she can only remove a block after its parent (the block directly above it) has been removed. This implies that the order of removal must respect the **parent-child dependency** in the tree.\\n\\nWe are to count the number of **distinct sequences** in which Laura can remove **exactly 5 blocks**, where the **order matters**.\\n\\nSince the root (top block) is the only removable block initially, it **must be removed first**. Thus, the sequence starts with the root, and we consider all valid sequences of length 5 starting with the root.\\n\\nThe problem reduces to counting the number of **linear extensions** of size 5 in a rooted 4-ary tree, where each node must appear **after its parent**.\\n\\nWe enumerate all possible combinations of nodes removed (i.e., how many from each level), ensuring the constraints:\\n- Level 1: 1 block (root)\\n- Level 2: up to 4 blocks\\n- Level 3: up to 16 blocks\\n- Level 4: up to 64 blocks\\n\\nLet $ x $, $ y $, $ z $ denote the number of blocks removed from levels 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Then:\\n$$\\nx + y + z = 4 \\\\quad \\\\text{(since root is always removed first)}\\n$$\\n\\nWe consider all valid combinations of $ (x, y, z) $ such that:\\n- $ y \\\\leq 4x $ (each level 3 block must have a level 2 parent)\\n- $ z \\\\leq 4y $ (each level 4 block must have a level 3 parent)\\n\\nFor each valid combination, we compute:\\n1. The number of ways to choose the specific blocks.\\n2. The number of valid **topological orderings** (i.e., sequences respecting parent-child dependencies).\\n\\nAfter detailed case analysis (as shown in the thought process), the total number of valid sequences is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Total} = 24 + 576 + 1152 + 768 + 96 + 576 + 192 = 3384\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"3384\"}",
