  "math_problem": "The game of Penta is played with teams of five players each, and there are five roles the players can play. Each of the five players chooses two of five roles they wish to play. If each player chooses their roles randomly, what is the probability that each role will have exactly two players? Instead of computing the probability that every role is selected by precisely two players, simply find T(favorable), the total number of favorable outcomes where each role receives exactly two choices. Given a positive integer $k$, let $\\|k\\|$ denote the absolute difference between $k$ and the nearest perfect square. For example, $\\|13\\|=3$ since the nearest perfect square to 13 is 16. Compute the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{\\|1\\|+\\|2\\|+\\cdots+\\|n\\|}{n}=(T(favorable)-1940)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine $ T(favorable) $, the number of favorable outcomes where each of the five roles is selected exactly twice by the five players. This corresponds to counting the number of 5x5 binary matrices with row and column sums equal to 2. Using known combinatorial results (OEIS A001499), this count is 2040.\\n\\nNext, we compute $ T(favorable) - 1940 = 2040 - 1940 = 100 $. We need to find the smallest positive integer $ n $ such that the average of $ \\\\|1\\\\| + \\\\|2\\\\| + \\\\cdots + \\\\|n\\\\| $ equals 100.\\n\\nThe function $ \\\\|k\\\\| $ represents the absolute difference between $ k $ and the nearest perfect square. For large $ n $, the average $ \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\|k\\\\|}{n} $ reaches 100 at specific points. By analyzing the structure of $ \\\\|k\\\\| $, we find that the average equals 100 at $ n = 89800 $ and $ n = 89999 $. The smallest such $ n $ is 89800, verified by solving the quadratic equation derived from the sum of $ \\\\|k\\\\| $ values in the relevant interval.\",\n    \"answer\": \"89800\"\n}",
