  "math_problem": "A point $(x, y)$ is selected uniformly at random from the unit square $S=\\{(x, y) \\mid 0 \\leq x \\leq 1,0 \\leq y \\leq 1\\}$. If the probability that $(3x+2y, x+4y)$ is in $S$ is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a+b$. Instead of computing the numerical identifier from the fractional probability that the transformed point remains within the unit square, simply find $k=$ area$(R) + 1553/120$, where area$(R)$ is the measure of the subset of the unit square on which both components of the linear transformation are at most 1. In bridge, a standard 52-card deck is dealt in the usual way to 4 players. By convention, each hand is assigned a number of \"points\" based on the formula $$(k - 9) \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~A} \\text {'s })+(k - 10) \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~K} \\text {'s })+(k - 11) \\times(\\# \\mathrm{Q} \\text {'s })+(k - 12) \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~J} \\text {'s })$$ Given that a particular hand has exactly 4 cards that are A, K, Q, or J, find the probability that its point value is $k$ or higher.",
