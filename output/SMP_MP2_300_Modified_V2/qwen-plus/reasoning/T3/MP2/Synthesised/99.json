  "math_problem": "A fat coin is one which, when tossed, has a $2 / 5$ probability of being heads, $2 / 5$ of being tails, and $1 / 5$ of landing on its edge. Mr. Fat starts at 0 on the real line. Every minute, he tosses a fat coin. If it's heads, he moves left, decreasing his coordinate by 1; if it's tails, he moves right, increasing his coordinate by 1. If the coin lands on its edge, he moves back to 0. If Mr. Fat does this ad infinitum, what fraction of his time will he spend at 0? Instead of finding the long-run proportion of time spent at the origin, simply find $r$, where $r$ is the factor less than 1 by which the stationary probability at distance $n$ from 0 relates to that at distance $n+1$, derived from the balance equations for the long-run proportions at non-zero positions. Let $Z$ be as in problem 15. Let $X$ be the greatest integer such that $|X Z| \\leq r + \\frac{9}{2}$. Find $X$.",

Due to symmetry, $ \\\\pi(k) = \\\\pi(-k) $ for all $ k \\\\neq 0 $, so we define:\\n\\n- $ \\\\pi(0) = a_0 $\\n- $ \\\\pi(k) = a_k $ for $ k \\\\geq 1 $\\n\\nWe derive the balance equations for the stationary distribution.\\n\\n#### For $ k \\\\geq 2 $:\\n$$\\n\\\\pi(k) = \\\\frac{2}{5} \\\\pi(k-1) + \\\\frac{2}{5} \\\\pi(k+1)\\n$$\\n\\nAssume a geometric form $ \\\\pi(k) = c r^k $ for $ k \\\\geq 1 $. Substituting into the recurrence:\\n\\n$$\\nc r^k = \\\\frac{2}{5} c r^{k-1} + \\\\frac{2}{5} c r^{k+1}\\n$$\\n\\nDivide both sides by $ c r^{k-1} $:\\n\\n$$\\nr = \\\\frac{2}{5} + \\\\frac{2}{5} r^2\\n$$\\n\\nMultiply through by 5:\\n\\n$$\\n5r = 2 + 2r^2 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad 2r^2 - 5r + 2 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nSolving this quadratic:\\n\\n$$\\nr = \\\\frac{5 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{25 - 16}}{4} = \\\\frac{5 \\\\pm 3}{4} \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad r = 2 \\\\text{ or } r = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\n$$\\n\\nSince $ r < 1 $, we take $ r = \\\\frac{1}{2} $.\\n\\nThus, the stationary probabilities decay geometrically as $ \\\\pi(k) = c \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right)^k $ for $ k \\\\geq 1 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Determine $ \\\\pi(0) $\\n\\nUsing the balance equation for $ k = 1 $:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\pi(1) = \\\\frac{2}{5} \\\\pi(0) + \\\\frac{2}{5} \\\\pi(2)\\n$$\\n\\nSubstitute $ \\\\pi(1) = c \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{2} $, $ \\\\pi(2) = c \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{4} $:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{c}{2} = \\\\frac{2}{5} \\\\pi(0) + \\\\frac{2}{5} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{c}{4} = \\\\frac{2}{5} \\\\pi(0) + \\\\frac{c}{10}\\n$$\\n\\nMultiply both sides by 10:\\n\\n$$\\n5c = 4 \\\\pi(0) + c \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad 4c = 4 \\\\pi(0) \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad \\\\pi(0) = c\\n$$\\n\\nNow compute total probability:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\pi(0) + 2 \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\pi(k) = c + 2 \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty c \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right)^k = c + 2c \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac{1/2}{1 - 1/2} \\\\right) = c + 2c = 3c\\n$$\\n\\nSet equal to 1:\\n\\n$$\\n3c = 1 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad c = \\\\frac{1}{3}\\n$$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n- $ \\\\pi(0) = \\\\frac{1}{3} $\\n- $ \\\\pi(k) = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right)^k $ for $ k \\\\geq 1 $\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Find $ r $\\n\\nThe problem defines $ r $ as the factor less than 1 such that:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\pi(n+1) = r \\\\cdot \\\\pi(n)\\n$$\\n\\nFrom above:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\pi(n+1) = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right)^{n+1}, \\\\quad \\\\pi(n) = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right)^n\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\pi(n+1)}{\\\\pi(n)} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\n$$\\n\\nSo $ r = \\\\frac{1}{2} $\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Use Given Information to Find $ X $\\n\\nWe are told:\\n\\n> Let $ Z $ be as in problem 15.

Find $ X $.\\n\\nFrom earlier, $ r = \\\\frac{1}{2} $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nr + \\\\frac{9}{2} = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{9}{2} = 5\\n$$\\n\\nAssuming **problem 15** asked for the long-run proportion of time spent at 0, which is $ \\\\pi(0) = \\\\frac{1}{3} $, then $ Z = \\\\frac{1}{3} $.\\n\\nNow solve:\\n\\n$$\\n|X \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{3}| \\\\leq 5 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad |X| \\\\leq 15\\n$$\\n\\nThe greatest integer $ X $ satisfying this is:\\n\\n$$\\nX = 15\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"15\"}",
