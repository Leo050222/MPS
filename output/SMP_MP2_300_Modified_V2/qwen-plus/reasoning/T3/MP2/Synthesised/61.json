  "math_problem": "You start with a single piece of chalk of length 1. Every second, you choose a piece of chalk that you have uniformly at random and break it in half. You continue this until you have 8 pieces of chalk. What is the probability that they all have length $\\frac{1}{8}$ ? Instead of determining the probability that the final pieces are all of equal length, simply find $e = \\binom{6}{3} - 16$, where $\\binom{6}{3}$ is the number of ways to interleave the remaining breaks equally between the two subpieces created by the first break. A complex quartic polynomial $Q$ is quirky if it has four distinct roots, one of which is the sum of the other three. There are four complex values of $k$ for which the polynomial $Q(x)=x^{e}-k x^{3}-x^{2}-x-(e + 41)$ is quirky. Compute the product of these four values of $k$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute $ e = \\\\binom{6}{3} - 16 $. Since $ \\\\binom{6}{3} = 20 $, we have $ e = 20 - 16 = 4 $. The polynomial becomes $ Q(x) = x^4 - kx^3 - x^2 - x - 45 $ (as $ e + 41 = 45 $). For $ Q(x) $ to be quirky, one root must be the sum of the other three. Let the roots be $ r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4 $ with $ r_4 = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 $. By Vieta's formulas: $ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 = k \\\\implies 2r_4 = k \\\\implies r_4 = k/2 $. Using Vieta's for sum of products and product of roots, substituting $ r_4 = k/2 $ leads to the equation $ (k/2)^4 + (k/2)^2 + (k/2) + 45 = 0 $. Multiplying by 16 gives $ k^4 + 4k^2 + 8k + 720 = 0 $. The product of the roots of this quartic (values of $ k $) is the constant term 720 (since the polynomial is monic).\",\n    \"answer\": \"720\"\n}",
