  "math_problem": "Let $x, y, z$ be real numbers satisfying $$\\frac{1}{x}+y+z=x+\\frac{1}{y}+z=x+y+\\frac{1}{z}=3$$ The sum of all possible values of $x+y+z$ can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing the sum of all possible totals and the associated $100m + n$, simply find $k = z - 2$, where $z$ is the common value taken by the two equal variables in the solution where exactly two of the variables are equal. Regular polygons $I C A O, V E N T I$, and $A L B E D O$ lie on a plane. Given that $I N= k$, compute the number of possible values of $O N$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves solving for real numbers $x, y, z$ satisfying three equations. By analyzing the system, we find that when exactly two variables are equal, the common value of the two equal variables is 3. Thus, $k = z - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1$. \\n\\nNext, considering the regular polygons:\\n- ICAO (4 letters) is a square.\\n- VENTI (5 letters) is a pentagon.\\n- ALBEDO (6 letters) is a hexagon.\\n\\nGiven $IN = k = 1$, where $I$ and $N$ are vertices of the pentagon VENTI, $IN$ corresponds to a diagonal of the pentagon. The number of possible values of $ON$ depends on the relative orientations of the square, pentagon, and hexagon. Since the square (4 sides) and hexagon (6 sides) share vertex $O$, their rotational symmetries have a greatest common divisor of 2. This leads to exactly 2 distinct configurations for $ON$, resulting in 2 possible values.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2\"\n}",
