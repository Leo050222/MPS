  "math_problem": "Find all real numbers $k$ such that $r^{4}+k r^{3}+r^{2}+4 k r+16=0$ is true for exactly one real number $r$. Instead of finding all real parameters $k$ such that the quartic equation has exactly one real solution $r$, simply find $\\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is the value of $k$ for which the unique real root is positive, derived from the factorization analysis of the polynomial. Daniel wrote all the positive integers from 1 to $n$ inclusive on a piece of paper. After careful observation, he realized that the sum of all the digits that he wrote was exactly $\\kappa + \\frac{40009}{4}$. Find $n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first analyze the quartic equation $ r^4 + k r^3 + r^2 + 4k r + 16 = 0 $. By substituting $ y = r + \\\\frac{4}{r} $ (valid for $ r \\\\neq 0 $), the equation transforms into $ y^2 + ky - 7 = 0 $. For real $ r $, $ y \\\\in (-\\\\infty, -4] \\\\cup [4, \\\\infty) $. The quadratic in $ y $ must yield exactly one valid $ y $ that leads to a single real root $ r $. When $ y = 4 $, the corresponding $ r $ is $ 2 $ (positive), and the other root of the quadratic in $ y $ lies within $ (-4, 4) $, yielding no real $ r $. Solving $ 4^2 + 4k - 7 = 0 $ gives $ k = -\\\\frac{9}{4} $, so $ \\\\kappa = -\\\\frac{9}{4} $.\\n\\nNext, the sum of digits from 1 to $ n $ equals $ \\\\kappa + \\\\frac{40009}{4} = \\\\frac{-9 + 40009}{4} = 10000 $. Calculating digit sums:\\n- Sum from 1–99: 900\\n- Sum from 100–199: 1000 → Total 1900\\n- Sum from 200–299: 1100 → Total 3000\\n- Sum from 300–399: 1200 → Total 4200\\n- Sum from 400–499: 1300 → Total 5500\\n- Sum from 500–599: 1400 → Total 6900\\n- Sum from 600–699: 1500 → Total 8400\\n- Sum from 700–799: 1600 → Total 10000\\n\\nThus, $ n = 799 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"799\"\n}",
