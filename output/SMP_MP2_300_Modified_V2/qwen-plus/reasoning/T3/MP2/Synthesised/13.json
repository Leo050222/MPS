  "math_problem": "Define a number to be an anti-palindrome if, when written in base 3 as $a_{n} a_{n-1} \\ldots a_{0}$, then $a_{i}+a_{n-i}=2$ for any $0 \\leq i \\leq n$. Find the number of anti-palindromes less than $3^{12}$ such that no two consecutive digits in base 3 are equal. Instead of determining the total count of qualifying anti-palindromes, simply find $k = b_1 + 27$, where $b_1$ is the number of valid anti-palindromes with one digit derived from the anti-palindrome condition and the no consecutive equal digits constraint. $(k - 18)$ positive integers are arranged around a circle. Each number is one more than the greatest common divisor of its two neighbors. What is the sum of the $(k - 18)$ numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ b_1 $, the number of one-digit anti-palindromes in base 3. A one-digit number $ a_0 $ must satisfy $ a_0 + a_0 = 2 $ (anti-palindrome condition), so $ 2a_0 = 2 \\\\implies a_0 = 1 $. The no consecutive digits constraint is vacuously true for one digit. Thus, $ b_1 = 1 $. Then $ k = b_1 + 27 = 28 $. Next, $ k - 18 = 10 $, so there are 10 positive integers arranged in a circle where each number is one more than the gcd of its neighbors. A valid cycle is $ [2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2] $, which satisfies the condition for all positions. Summing these values: $ 2+3+4+3+2+2+3+4+3+2 = 28 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"28\"\n}",
