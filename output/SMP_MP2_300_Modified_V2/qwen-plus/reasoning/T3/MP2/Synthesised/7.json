Instead of counting the total number of triangle-free graphs with exactly 23 edges on the given labeled vertices, simply find $m = N_{\\Delta=5} - 37798$, where $N_{\\Delta=5}$ is the number of such graphs where the maximum degree is exactly 5. Suppose $f(x)$ is a rational function such that $3f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + \\frac{2f(x)}{x} = x^{2}$ for $x \\neq 0$. Find $f(-m)$.",

A triangle-free graph with 23 edges must be a subgraph of $ K_{5,5} $, as any non-bipartite triangle-free graph would have fewer edges due to the constraint $ e(G) > \\\\frac{n^2}{4} - \\\\frac{n}{2} = 20 $ for $ n = 10 $.\\n\\nThe number of distinct $ K_{5,5} $ graphs (accounting for labeled vertices) is $ \\\\binom{10}{5}/2 = 126 $. Each $ K_{5,5} $ has 25 edges, so the number of subgraphs with 23 edges is $ \\\\binom{25}{2} = 300 $. Since removing two edges from $ K_{5,5} $ keeps the graph connected and bipartite, each such subgraph has a unique bipartition and maximum degree exactly 5 (as at least 6 vertices retain degree 5). Thus, $ N_{\\\\Delta=5} = 126 \\\\times 300 = 37800 $.\\n\\nTherefore, $ m = 37800 - 37798 = 2 $.\\n\\nNext, we solve for $ f(-m) = f(-2) $, where $ f(x) $ satisfies $ 3f\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{2f(x)}{x} = x^2 $. Substituting $ x \\\\to \\\\frac{1}{x} $ gives a second equation. Solving the system:\\n- Original: $ 3f(1/x) + \\\\frac{2}{x}f(x) = x^2 $\\n- Substituted: $ 3f(x) + 2x f(1/x) = \\\\frac{1}{x^2} $\\n\\nSolving for $ f(x) $, we find $ f(x) = \\\\frac{3 - 2x^5}{5x^2} $. Evaluating at $ x = -2 $:\\n$$\\nf(-2) = \\\\frac{3 - 2(-2)^5}{5(-2)^2} = \\\\frac{3 + 64}{20} = \\\\frac{67}{20}\\n$$\",\n    \"answer\": \"67/20\"\n}",
