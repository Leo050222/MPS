  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be square with 4 digits, such that all its digits are less than 6. If we add 1 to each digit the resulting number is another square. Find $n$ Instead of identifying the 4-digit perfect square satisfying the digit increment condition, simply find $m = a - 42$, where $a$ is the integer whose square is that number. P is a polynomial. When P is divided by $x-1$, the remainder is -4 . When P is divided by $x-2$, the remainder is -1 . When $P$ is divided by $x-3$, the remainder is 4 . Determine the remainder when $P$ is divided by $x^{m}-6 x^{2}+11 x-6$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, identify the 4-digit square $ n = a^2 $ where all digits are less than 6. Adding 1 to each digit gives another square $ b^2 $, so $ b^2 - a^2 = 1111 $. Factoring $ 1111 = 11 \\\\times 101 $, we solve $ (b - a)(b + a) = 1111 $. The valid factor pair is $ (11, 101) $, yielding $ a = 45 $ (since $ a = (101 - 11)/2 = 45 $). Thus, $ m = a - 42 = 3 $. \\n\\nNext, the divisor polynomial is $ x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) $. The remainder when $ P $ is divided by this cubic must be a quadratic $ R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $. Using the given remainders:\\n- $ R(1) = -4 \\\\implies a + b + c = -4 $\\n- $ R(2) = -1 \\\\implies 4a + 2b + c = -1 $\\n- $ R(3) = 4 \\\\implies 9a + 3b + c = 4 $\\n\\nSolving the system yields $ a = 1 $, $ b = 0 $, $ c = -5 $, so $ R(x) = x^2 - 5 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"x^2 - 5\"\n}",
