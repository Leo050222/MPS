  "math_problem": "Let $\\omega_{1}$ be a circle of radius 5, and let $\\omega_{2}$ be a circle of radius 2 whose center lies on $\\omega_{1}$. Let the two circles intersect at $A$ and $B$, and let the tangents to $\\omega_{2}$ at $A$ and $B$ intersect at $P$. If the area of $\\triangle ABP$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $b$ is square-free and $a, c$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a+10b+c$. Instead of computing the encoded integer from the parameters in the simplified expression for the area of $\\triangle ABP$, simply find $m = c - 22$, where $c$ is the denominator in that fractional expression derived from the geometric configuration of the circles and tangents. How many ways can you color the squares of a $(m - 1) \\times 2008$ grid in $m$ colors such that no two squares of the same color share an edge?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the area of triangle ABP. Circle ω₁ has radius 5, ω₂ has radius 2 with center on ω₁, so the distance between centers O₁ and O₂ is 5. Solving the circle equations, the radical axis (line AB) is x = 23/5. The length of AB is 8√6/5. The tangents from P to ω₂ at A and B intersect at P, which lies on the x-axis. Using the polar line distance formula, the distance from O₂ to AB is 2/5, so O₂P = 10, placing P at (-5, 0). The area of △ABP is (1/2) * (8√6/5) * (48/5) = 192√6/25. Thus, c = 25, so m = c - 22 = 3.\\n\\nNext, consider a (m - 1) × 2008 = 2 × 2008 grid with m = 3 colors. For a 2×n grid, the number of valid colorings (no adjacent same color) follows a recurrence: each column has 3 extensions from the previous, starting with 6 colorings for n=1. The formula is 2 * 3^n. For n = 2008, the number of colorings is 2 * 3^2008.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2*3^2008\"\n}",
