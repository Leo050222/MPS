  "math_problem": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form. Determine all the roots, real or complex, of the system of simultaneous equations $x + y + z = m$, $x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = m$, $x^{m} + y^{m} + z^{m} = m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, analyze Alice's rock game. The initial pile is 2015 rocks (5×403). For the number of rocks left after each round to be a multiple of 5, each removal must be a multiple of 5. Define state M as the number of 5-rock units (N = 5M). The probability of transitioning from state M to a valid state is derived via recurrence relations. The key insight is that the probability p corresponds to f(403), where f(M) follows a recurrence based on valid transitions. \\n\\nTo find the exponent of 31 in p's form:\\n- Numerator (product of 5t + 1 for t=1 to 402) has 13 terms divisible by 31, with one term (t=192) divisible by 31², giving total exponent 14.\\n- Denominator (403!) has exponent of 31 equal to 13 (since 403 = 13×31).\\n- Thus, exponent b of 31 in p is 14 - 13 = 1.\\n\\nGiven m = b + 2 = 3, solve the system:\\nx + y + z = 3,\\nx² + y² + z² = 3,\\nx³ + y³ + z³ = 3.\\n\\nUsing symmetric sums, the elementary symmetric polynomials yield the polynomial (t - 1)³ = 0, so all roots are 1 (triple root).\",\n    \"answer\": \"1, 1, 1\"\n}",
