  "math_problem": "Roger initially has 20 socks in a drawer, each of which is either white or black. He chooses a sock uniformly at random from the drawer and throws it away. He repeats this action until there are equal numbers of white and black socks remaining. Suppose that the probability he stops before all socks are gone is $p$. If the sum of all distinct possible values of $p$ over all initial combinations of socks is $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the sum of all distinct possible values of the stopping probability over all initial combinations of socks, simply find $p_{10}$, the stopping probability when the drawer initially contains an equal number of white and black socks. There are $p_{10} + \\frac{38324}{19}$ frogs in a pool and there is 1 frog on the shore. In each time-step thereafter, one random frog moves position. If it was in the pool, it jumps to the shore, and vice versa. Find the expected number of time-steps before all frogs are in the pool for the first time.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine $ p_{10} $, the stopping probability when Roger initially has 10 white and 10 black socks (20 total). The process stops when the number of white and black socks becomes equal again after throwing socks. Starting with equal numbers, the first throw results in an imbalance (e.g., 9W10B or 10W9B), and the process continues until equality is restored. This is modeled as a symmetric random walk on the difference $ d = W - B $, where the walk starts at $ d = 0 $, takes a step to $ d = \\\\pm1 $, and we compute the probability of returning to $ d = 0 $ before reaching $ t = 0 $ (all socks gone).\\n\\nFor $ 2n $ socks (equal numbers), the stopping probability $ p_n $ is derived as $ \\\\frac{2(n-1)}{2n - 1} $. For $ n = 10 $, this gives $ p_{10} = \\\\frac{18}{19} $.\\n\\nNext, the number of frogs in the pool is $ p_{10} + \\\\frac{38324}{19} = \\\\frac{18 + 38324}{19} = 2018 $. With 1 frog on the shore, the total number of frogs is $ N = 2019 $.\\n\\nThe problem reduces to finding the expected time for all frogs to be in the pool, starting with 1 on the shore. This is a classic Markov chain problem where each step randomly moves a frog between the pool and shore. The expected time to reach all frogs in the pool (state $ k = 0 $) from $ k = 1 $ (1 frog on shore) is known to be $ 2^N - 1 $ for $ N $ total frogs. For $ N = 2019 $, this is $ 2^{2019} - 1 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2^2019 - 1\"\n}",
