  "math_problem": "In a $k \\times k$ chessboard, a set $S$ of 25 cells that are in a $5 \\times 5$ square is chosen uniformly at random. The probability that there are more black squares than white squares in $S$ is $48\\%$. Find $k$. Instead of determining the dimension of the board, simply find $b = n - 3$, where $n$ is the number of possible starting positions along one dimension for the subsquare derived from the positional analysis of the board. Find all ordered pairs of integers $(x, y)$ such that $3^{x} 4^{y}=b^{x+y}+b^{2(x+y)-1}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the number of starting positions $ n $ for a $ 5 \\\\times 5 $ square on a $ k \\\\times k $ chessboard. The probability of more black squares (13) than white squares (12) in the $ 5 \\\\times 5 $ square is 48%, which occurs when the top-left corner is white (since 48% < 50%). For an $ n \\\\times n $ grid of starting positions, the number of positions where the top-left corner is white (i.e., $ a + b $ odd) is $ \\\\frac{n^2 - 1}{2} $ when $ n $ is odd. Setting $ \\\\frac{n^2 - 1}{2n^2} = 0.48 $, solving gives $ n = 5 $. Thus, $ b = n - 3 = 2 $. \\n\\nNext, solve $ 3^x 4^y = 2^{x+y} + 2^{2(x+y)-1} $. Let $ s = x + y $. Testing integer values:\\n- For $ s = 1 $: $ 3^x 4^{1-x} = 4 $. Solution $ x = 0, y = 1 $.\\n- For $ s = 2 $: $ 3^x 4^{2-x} = 12 $. Solution $ x = 1, y = 1 $.\\n- For $ s = 4 $: $ 3^x 4^{4-x} = 144 $. Solution $ x = 2, y = 2 $.\\nNo other integer solutions exist. The valid ordered pairs are $ (0, 1) $, $ (1, 1) $, and $ (2, 2) $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(0,1),(1,1),(2,2)\"\n}",
