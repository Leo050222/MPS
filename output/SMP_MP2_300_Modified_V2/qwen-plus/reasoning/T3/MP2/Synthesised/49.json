  "math_problem": "How many ways, without taking order into consideration, can 2002 be expressed as the sum of 3 positive integers (for instance, $1000+1000+2$ and $1000+2+1000$ are considered to be the same way)? Instead of determining the total number of unordered triples of positive integers that sum to the given total, simply find $l$, the terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends. Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer with exactly $(l + 2012)$ positive factors. What is the sum of the (not necessarily distinct) prime factors of $n$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing how many unordered triples of positive integers sum to 2002. The key is to determine the terminal term $ l $ of the shorter arithmetic sequence that arises in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Understanding the Structure of Unordered Triples\\n\\nWe are looking for all unordered triples $ (a, b, c) $ such that:\\n- $ a + b + c = 2002 $\\n- $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c $\\n\\nThis implies:\\n- $ a \\\\geq 1 $\\n- $ b \\\\geq a $\\n- $ c \\\\geq b $\\n\\nFrom these constraints, we derive:\\n- $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c \\\\Rightarrow 3b \\\\leq a + b + c = 2002 \\\\Rightarrow b \\\\leq \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2002}{3} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 667 $\\n- Also, since $ c = 2002 - a - b \\\\geq b $, we get $ a \\\\leq 2002 - 2b $\\n\\nThus, for each valid $ b $, the number of valid $ a $ values is:\\n- If $ b \\\\leq 667 $, then $ a \\\\in [1, b] $, so there are $ b $ valid values.\\n- If $ b > 667 $, then $ a \\\\in [1, 2002 - 2b] $, so there are $ 2002 - 2b $ valid values.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Identifying the Shorter Arithmetic Sequence\\n\\nThe two sequences of counts (number of valid $ a $ values for each $ b $) are:\\n\\n1. **First sequence** (for $ b = 1 $ to $ 667 $):  \\n   $ 1, 2, 3, \\\\dots, 667 $  \\n   This is an arithmetic sequence with length 667.\\n\\n2. **Second sequence** (for $ b = 668 $ to $ 1000 $):  \\n   $ 666, 664, \\\\dots, 2 $  \\n   This is an arithmetic sequence with common difference $-2$, starting at 666 and ending at 2.  \\n   Number of terms: $ 1000 - 668 + 1 = 333 $\\n\\nSince $ 333 < 667 $, the **shorter sequence** is the second one. Its **terminal term** is **2**, so:\\n$$\\nl = 2\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Finding the Smallest Integer with Exactly $ l + 2012 = 2014 $ Divisors\\n\\nWe now find the smallest positive integer $ n $ with exactly 2014 positive divisors.\\n\\n#### Factorization of 2014\\n$$\\n2014 = 2 \\\\times 19 \\\\times 53\\n$$\\n\\nThe number of positive divisors of $ n $ is given by:\\n$$\\n\\\\text{If } n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\\\cdots p_k^{e_k}, \\\\quad \\\\text{then } \\\\tau(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)\\\\cdots(e_k + 1)\\n$$\\n\\nSo we want:\\n$$\\n(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)(e_3 + 1) = 2014 = 2 \\\\times 19 \\\\times 53\\n$$\\n\\nAssigning the largest exponents to the smallest primes minimizes $ n $. Thus, we assign:\\n- $ e_1 + 1 = 53 \\\\Rightarrow e_1 = 52 $\\n- $ e_2 + 1 = 19 \\\\Rightarrow e_2 = 18 $\\n- $ e_3 + 1 = 2 \\\\Rightarrow e_3 = 1 $\\n\\nTherefore, the minimal $ n $ is:\\n$$\\nn = 2^{52} \\\\cdot 3^{18} \\\\cdot 5^1\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Sum of Prime Factors (With Multiplicity)\\n\\nWe compute the sum of all prime factors of $ n $, counting multiplicities:\\n- $ 52 \\\\times 2 = 104 $\\n- $ 18 \\\\times 3 = 54 $\\n- $ 1 \\\\times 5 = 5 $\\n\\nTotal:\\n$$\\n104 + 54 + 5 = 163\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"163\"}",
