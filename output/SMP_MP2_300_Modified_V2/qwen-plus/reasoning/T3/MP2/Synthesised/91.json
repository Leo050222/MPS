  "math_problem": "Tetrahedron $A B C D$ has side lengths $A B=6, B D=6 \\sqrt{2}, B C=10, A C=8, C D=10$, and $A D=6$. The distance from vertex $A$ to face $B C D$ can be written as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are positive integers, $b$ is square-free, and $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$. Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of computing the encoded value $100a + 10b + c$ from the parameters of the distance expression, simply find $d = \\gcd(a, c) + 0$, where $a, b, c$ are the positive integers such that the distance is $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$ with $b$ square-free and $\\gcd(a, c)=1$. Find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(x, y)$ with $x, y \\leq 2020$ such that $(k + 2) x^{2}+10 x y+(k + 2) y^{2}$ is the power of some prime $p^k$ for integer $k \\geq d$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves finding the distance from vertex $A$ to face $BCD$ in tetrahedron $ABCD$, then using that to determine $d = \\\\gcd(a, c)$ where the distance is $\\\\frac{a\\\\sqrt{b}}{c}$. Finally, we count ordered pairs $(x, y)$ with $x, y \\\\leq 2020$ such that $(k + 2)x^2 + 10xy + (k + 2)y^2 = p^k$ for some prime $p$ and $k \\\\geq d$.\\n\\n**Step 1: Distance from $A$ to face $BCD$**\\n\\nGiven side lengths:\\n- $AB = 6$, $BD = 6\\\\sqrt{2}$, $BC = 10$, $AC = 8$, $CD = 10$, $AD = 6$.\\n\\nFace $BCD$ has sides $BC = CD = 10$, $BD = 6\\\\sqrt{2}$. Using Heron's formula or geometry, the area of $\\\\triangle BCD$ is $6\\\\sqrt{41}$.\\n\\nUsing coordinates:\\n- Place $B = (0, 0, 0)$, $D = (6\\\\sqrt{2}, 0, 0)$, $C = (3\\\\sqrt{2}, \\\\sqrt{82}, 0)$.\\n- Solve for $A = (x, y, z)$ with $AB = 6$, $AD = 6$, $AC = 8$.\\n- Find $z = \\\\pm \\\\frac{24\\\\sqrt{41}}{41}$, so the distance from $A$ to $BCD$ is $\\\\frac{24\\\\sqrt{41}}{41}$.\\n\\nThus, $a = 24$, $b = 41$, $c = 41$, with $\\\\gcd(a, c) = 1$. Hence, $d = \\\\gcd(a, c) = 1$.\\n\\n**Step 2: Counting valid $(x, y)$ pairs**\\n\\nWe need $(k + 2)x^2 + 10xy + (k + 2)y^2 = p^k$ for $k \\\\geq 1$ (since $d = 1$).\\n\\n- **Case $k = 3$:** The quadratic form becomes $5(x + y)^2 = 5^3 = 125$, so $x + y = 5$. Valid pairs: $(1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)$ (4 pairs).\\n- **Case $k = 9$:** The quadratic form becomes $32t^2 = 2^9 = 512$ for $x = y = t$, so $t = 4$. Valid pair: $(4, 4)$ (1 pair).\\n\\nNo other values of $k$ yield valid solutions within $x, y \\\\leq 2020$. Total ordered pairs: $4 + 1 = 5$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
