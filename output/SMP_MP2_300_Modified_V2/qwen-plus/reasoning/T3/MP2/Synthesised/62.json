  "math_problem": "Let the function $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ take only integer inputs and have integer outputs. For any integers $x$ and $y$, $f$ satisfies $f(x)+f(y)=f(x+1)+f(y-1)$. If $f(2016)=6102$ and $f(6102)=2016$, what is $f(1)$? Instead of determining the value of the function at a specific input, simply find $h = k + 5$, where $k$ is the constant difference $f(z+1) - f(z)$ for all integers $z$ derived from the functional equation. Let $n$ be a positive integer. In how many ways can a $h \\times hn$ grid be tiled with the following tetromino?\n[asy]\nsize(4cm);\ndraw((1,0)--(3,0)--(3,1)--(0,1)--(0,0)--(1,0)--(1,2)--(2,2)--(2,0));\n[/asy]",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The functional equation $f(x) + f(y) = f(x+1) + f(y-1)$ implies that the difference $f(z+1) - f(z)$ is constant for all integers $z$. Let this constant be $k$. Rearranging the equation gives $f(x+1) - f(x) = f(y) - f(y-1)$, confirming $k$ is constant. Thus, $f$ is linear: $f(z) = kz + c$.\\n\\nUsing the given values $f(2016) = 6102$ and $f(6102) = 2016$:\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{cases}\\n2016k + c = 6102 \\\\\\\\\\n6102k + c = 2016\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n$$\\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\\n$$\\n(6102 - 2016)k = 2016 - 6102 \\\\implies 4086k = -4086 \\\\implies k = -1.\\n$$\\nThus, $h = k + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4$.\\n\\nThe grid to tile is $4 \\\\times 4n$. The given tetromino (from the Asymptote code) is the T-tetromino, which covers 4 squares. However, the T-tetromino cannot tile any rectangle due to coloring arguments and known tiling constraints. Specifically, a checkerboard coloring shows that each T-tetromino covers 3 squares of one color and 1 of the other, but a $4 \\\\times 4n$ grid has equal black and white squares. While the counts balance for even numbers of tetrominoes, the T-tetromino's structure prevents tiling any rectangle, including $4 \\\\times 4n$ grids. Thus, the number of tilings is 0 for any positive integer $n$.\", \"answer\": \"0\"}",
