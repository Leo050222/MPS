  "math_problem": "Let $n=2000$ and $p=23$. The exponent of $p$ in $n!$ is $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\lfloor n / p^k \\rfloor$. Find the greatest positive integer $x$ such that $p^{6+x}$ divides $n!$. Instead of determining the largest additional exponent beyond 6 for which the prime power divides the factorial, simply find $m = \\lfloor n / p \\rfloor - 36$, where $\\lfloor n / p \\rfloor$ is the first term in the sum for the exponent of $p$ in $n!$. Let $S=\\{-100,-99,-98, \\ldots, 99,100\\}$. Choose a $m$-element subset $T$ of $S$ at random. Find the expected number of elements of the set $\\{|x|: x \\in T\\}$.",
