  "math_problem": "Determine the positive real value of $x$ for which $$\\sqrt{2+A C+2 C x}+\\sqrt{A C-2+2 A x}=\\sqrt{2(A+C) x+2 A C}$$. Instead of determining the positive real number that equates the sum of the two specified square roots to the third square root, simply find $k = b + 5$, where $b$ is the value assumed by the inner expression of the second square root when the equation holds. Solve the equation\n\\[ 3^x - k^y = z^2. \\]\nin positive integers.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the given square root equation. Let the equation be $\\\\sqrt{2 + AC + 2Cx} + \\\\sqrt{AC - 2 + 2Ax} = \\\\sqrt{2(A + C)x + 2AC}$. Squaring both sides and simplifying shows that the product of the square roots must be zero. Since the first square root cannot be zero (as its inner expression is positive for positive $x$), the second square root must be zero. Thus, $AC - 2 + 2Ax = 0$, so $b = 0$ (the inner expression of the second square root). Then $k = b + 5 = 5$. Next, solve $3^x - 5^y = z^2$ in positive integers. Testing small values, $x=2$, $y=1$, $z=2$ satisfies $3^2 - 5^1 = 9 - 5 = 4 = 2^2$. Modulo analysis confirms no other solutions exist. The only solution is $(x, y, z) = (2, 1, 2)$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2, 1, 2\"\n}",
