Suppose $x^{(k + 2)}-a x^{(k + 1)}+b x-(k + 47)$ is a polynomial with three positive roots $p, q$, and $r$ such that $p<q<r$. What is the minimum possible value of $k / p+2 / q+3 / r$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the Diophantine equation $m^5 - n^5 = 16mn$ for integer pairs $(m, n)$ with opposite signs. Assume $m = -a$ (negative) and $n > 0$ (positive), leading to $a^5 + n^5 = 16an$. Testing small positive integers, the only solution is $a = 2$, $n = 2$, giving $(m, n) = (-2, 2)$. Thus, $n = 2$ (positive integer in the opposite-sign pair), so $k = n - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nNext, consider the polynomial $x^{k+2} - a x^{k+1} + b x - (k + 47)$ with $k = 1$, which becomes $x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48$. By Vieta's formulas, the roots $p, q, r$ satisfy $pqr = 48$ and $p < q < r$. We need to minimize $\\\\frac{k}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r} = \\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$.\\n\\nUsing Lagrange multipliers with constraint $pqr = 48$, we find the minimum occurs at $p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$ (since $2 \\\\cdot 4 \\\\cdot 6 = 48$). Substituting these values gives $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{3}{2}$. Testing other factorizations of 48 confirms this is the minimum.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3/2\"\n}",
