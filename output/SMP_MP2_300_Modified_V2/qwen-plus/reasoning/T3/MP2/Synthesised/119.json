  "math_problem": "Let $S(n)$ be the sum of the digits of the positive integer $n$. Find all $n$ such that $S(n)(S(n)-1)=n-1$. Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ satisfying the given condition, simply find $k = S(n) + 4$, where $n$ is the smallest such positive integer. Penta chooses $k$ of the vertices of a unit cube. What is the maximum possible volume of the figure whose vertices are the $k$ chosen points?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the equation:\\n\\n$$\\nS(n)(S(n) - 1) = n - 1\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $ S(n) $ is the sum of the digits of the positive integer $ n $. Let $ s = S(n) $, so the equation becomes:\\n\\n$$\\ns(s - 1) = n - 1 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad n = s^2 - s + 1\\n$$\\n\\nWe are to find the **smallest** positive integer $ n $ satisfying this condition. We test small values of $ s $:\\n\\n- For $ s = 1 $: $ n = 1^2 - 1 + 1 = 1 $, and $ S(1) = 1 $, so $ 1 \\\\cdot 0 = 0 = 1 - 1 $. ✅\\n- For $ s = 2 $: $ n = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3 $, but $ S(3) = 3 \\\\neq 2 $. ❌\\n- For $ s = 3 $: $ n = 9 - 3 + 1 = 7 $, but $ S(7) = 7 \\\\neq 3 $. ❌\\n- For $ s = 4 $: $ n = 16 - 4 + 1 = 13 $, and $ S(13) = 4 $, so $ 4 \\\\cdot 3 = 12 = 13 - 1 $. ✅\\n\\nThus, both $ n = 1 $ and $ n = 13 $ satisfy the equation. Since $ n = 1 $ is smaller, it is the **smallest** solution.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Compute $ k = S(n) + 4 $\\n\\nFor $ n = 1 $, $ S(n) = 1 $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nk = 1 + 4 = 5\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Maximum Volume of a Figure with 5 Vertices from a Unit Cube\\n\\nA unit cube has 8 vertices. We are to choose 5 of them and compute the **maximum possible volume** of the convex hull formed by these points.\\n\\nThe maximum volume occurs when the selected 5 vertices form a configuration that maximizes the spatial spread within the cube. A known optimal configuration is:\\n\\n- $ (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,1) $\\n\\nThis set includes the origin and three adjacent vertices along the axes, plus the opposite corner.\\n\\nThe convex hull of these five points forms a polyhedron whose volume can be computed as the sum of three tetrahedrons:\\n\\n1. $ (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,1) $ → volume $ \\\\frac{1}{6} $\\n2. $ (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,1) $ → volume $ \\\\frac{1}{6} $\\n3. $ (0,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,1) $ → volume $ \\\\frac{1}{6} $\\n\\nTotal volume:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{6} + \\\\frac{1}{6} + \\\\frac{1}{6} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\n$$\\n\\nThis is the **maximum possible volume** for any 5-vertex subset of the unit cube.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Final Answer\\n\\nThe value of $ k = S(n) + 4 = 5 $, and the maximum volume of the figure formed by choosing 5 vertices of a unit cube is $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $.\", \"answer\": \"1/2\"}",
