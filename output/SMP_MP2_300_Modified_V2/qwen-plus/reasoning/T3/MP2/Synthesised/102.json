  "math_problem": "Simplify: $2 \\sqrt{1.5+\\sqrt{2}}-(1.5+\\sqrt{2})$. Instead of determining the simplified value of the given algebraic expression, simply find $k = \\sqrt{4} - 1$, where $\\sqrt{4}$ is the rational component in the denested form of the nested square root derived from the structural analysis of the expression. Find a nonzero monic polynomial $P(x)$ with integer coefficients and minimal degree such that $P(k-\\sqrt[3]{2}+\\sqrt[3]{4})=(k - 1)$. (A polynomial is called monic if its leading coefficient is 1.)",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine k. The problem states k = \\u221a4 - 1, where \\u221a4 is the rational component in the denested form. Since \\u221a4 = 2 (a rational number), k = 2 - 1 = 1. Next, compute k - 1 = 0. The task is to find a monic polynomial P(x) with integer coefficients such that P(k - \\u221b2 + \\u221b4) = 0. Let \\u03b2 = \\u221b2, so \\u221b4 = \\u03b2\\u00b2 and k - \\u221b2 + \\u221b4 = 1 - \\u03b2 + \\u03b2\\u00b2. Denote \\u03b1 = 1 - \\u03b2 + \\u03b2\\u00b2. To find the minimal polynomial of \\u03b1, express powers of \\u03b1 in terms of \\u03b2. Using \\u03b2\\u00b3 = 2, compute \\u03b1\\u00b2 = 3\\u03b2\\u00b2 - 3 and \\u03b1\\u00b3 = 9\\u03b2 - 9. Substitute \\u03b2 from \\u03b1\\u00b2 to derive \\u03b1\\u00b3 - 3\\u03b1\\u00b2 + 9\\u03b1 - 9 = 0. This cubic polynomial is irreducible over \\u211a (no rational roots via Rational Root Theorem), so it is the minimal monic polynomial with integer coefficients.\",\n    \"answer\": \"x^3 - 3x^2 + 9x - 9\"\n}",
