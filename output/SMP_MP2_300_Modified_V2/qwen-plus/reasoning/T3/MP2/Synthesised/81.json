  "math_problem": "Find two lines of symmetry of the graph of the function $y=x+\\frac{1}{x}$. Express your answer as two equations of the form $y=a x+b$. Instead of determining the equations of the lines of symmetry, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote parallel to the y-axis, derived from the asymptotic analysis of the curve. Determine all triplets of real numbers $(x, y, z)$ satisfying the system of equations $x^{2} y+y^{2} z =k+1039$, $x^{2} z+z^{2} y =260$, $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) =-540$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, identify the vertical asymptote of $ y = x + \\\\frac{1}{x} $, which is $ x = 0 $. The coefficient vector for this line (in standard form $ 1x + 0y = 0 $) has a Euclidean norm of $ \\\\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 1 $, so $ k = 1 $. Substituting $ k = 1 $ into the system, we solve:\\n- $ x^2 y + y^2 z = 1040 $\\n- $ x^2 z + z^2 y = 260 $\\n- $ (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) = -540 $\\n\\nBy analyzing the first two equations, we find $ y = 4z $. Substituting $ y = 4z $ into the system and solving leads to $ x = \\\\frac{16}{t^2} $ where $ t = z $. Further substitution into the third equation yields a cubic equation in $ t $, solved as $ t = 1 $ and $ t = 4 $. This gives the triplets $ (16, 4, 1) $ and $ (1, 16, 4) $, both satisfying all equations.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(16,4,1),(1,16,4)\"\n}",
