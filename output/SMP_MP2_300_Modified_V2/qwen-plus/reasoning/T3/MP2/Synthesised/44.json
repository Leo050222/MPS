  "math_problem": "Let $k$ be the answer to this problem. The probability that an integer chosen uniformly at random from $\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$ is a multiple of 11 can be written as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing $100a + b$, simply find $d = \\gcd(a, b)$, where $\\frac{a}{b}$ is the reduced form of the probability. Suppose $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. Isabella and Vidur both fill up an $a \\times b$ table. Isabella fills it up with numbers $1,2, \\ldots, a b$, putting the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, b$ in the first row, $b+1, b+2, \\ldots, 2 b$ in the second row, and so on. Vidur fills it up like a multiplication table, putting $i j$ in the cell in row $i$ and column $j$. The sum of the numbers in Isabella's grid is $\\frac{a b (a b + d)}{2}$ and the sum of the numbers in Vidur's grid is $\\frac{a (a + d) b (b + d)}{4}$; the difference between these two quantities is $(d + 1199)$. Compute $a+b$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves finding $a + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are coprime positive integers derived from a probability condition and grid sums. The key steps are:\\n\\n1. **Grid Sum Difference**: The difference between Isabella's and Vidur's grid sums is given as $d + 1199$, where $d = \\\\gcd(a, b)$. Since $a/b$ is the reduced form of the probability, $d = 1$, so the difference is $1200$.\\n\\n2. **Equation Setup**: The difference simplifies to $\\\\frac{ab(a-1)(b-1)}{4} = 1200$, leading to $ab(a-1)(b-1) = 4800$.\\n\\n3. **Finding Coprime Pairs**: Solving $ab(a-1)(b-1) = 4800$ with $\\\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, the valid coprime pair is $(a, b) = (5, 16)$ (or vice versa), as $5 \\\\times 16 \\\\times 4 \\\\times 15 = 4800$.\\n\\n4. **Verification**: Although the probability condition initially seems inconsistent, the problem structure prioritizes the grid condition. The answer $a + b = 5 + 16 = 21$ satisfies all grid-related constraints with $d = 1$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"21\"\n}",
