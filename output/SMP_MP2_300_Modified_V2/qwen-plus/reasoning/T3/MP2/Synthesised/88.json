  "math_problem": "In the game of Galactic Dominion, players compete to amass cards, each of which is worth a certain number of points. Say you are playing a version of this game with only two kinds of cards, planet cards and hegemon cards. Each planet card is worth 2010 points, and each hegemon card is worth four points per planet card held. You start with no planet cards and no hegemon cards, and, on each turn, starting at turn one, you take either a planet card or a hegemon card, whichever is worth more points given the hand you currently hold. Define a sequence \\(\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}\\) for all positive integers \\(n\\) by setting \\(a_{n}\\) to be 0 if on turn \\(n\\) you take a planet card and 1 if you take a hegemon card. What is the smallest value of \\(N\\) such that the sequence \\(a_{N}, a_{N+1}, \\ldots\\) is necessarily periodic (meaning that there is a positive integer \\(k\\) such that \\(a_{n+k}=a_{n}\\) for all \\(n \\geq N\\)) ? Instead of determining the minimal index from which the tail of the sequence is periodic, simply find \\(k = a_{502} + 9\\), where \\(a_{502}\\) is the term of the sequence at position 502 derived from the game's decision rules. Two positive rational numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), when written in lowest terms, have the property that the sum of their numerators is \\(k\\) and the sum of their denominators is \\(k + 1\\). What is the largest possible value of \\(x+y\\)?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the game mechanics of Galactic Dominion. Each turn, a player chooses between a planet card (worth 2010 points) or a hegemon card (worth 4 points per planet card held). The decision is based on which option yields more points at that moment.\\n\\nLet $ p(n) $ be the number of planet cards after $ n $ turns. On turn $ n $, the player has $ p(n-1) $ planet cards before making a choice. The value of taking a planet card is always 2010, while the value of taking a hegemon card is $ 4 \\\\cdot p(n-1) $. The player selects the option with the higher value.\\n\\nWe determine when the player switches from taking planet cards to hegemon cards:\\n- While $ 4 \\\\cdot p(n-1) < 2010 $, the player takes a planet card.\\n- This inequality holds as long as $ p(n-1) \\\\leq 502 $, since $ 4 \\\\cdot 502 = 2008 < 2010 $ and $ 4 \\\\cdot 503 = 2012 > 2010 $.\\n\\nThus, for turns $ n = 1 $ through $ n = 503 $, the player takes a planet card ($ a_n = 0 $), and starting at turn $ n = 504 $, the player takes a hegemon card ($ a_n = 1 $).\\n\\nTherefore, $ a_{502} = 0 $, and so:\\n$$\\nk = a_{502} + 9 = 0 + 9 = 9\\n$$\\n\\nNext, we are given two positive rational numbers $ x $ and $ y $ in lowest terms such that:\\n- The sum of their numerators is $ k = 9 $\\n- The sum of their denominators is $ k + 1 = 10 $\\n\\nWe aim to maximize $ x + y $. Let $ x = \\\\frac{a}{b} $ and $ y = \\\\frac{c}{d} $, where $ \\\\gcd(a,b) = \\\\gcd(c,d) = 1 $, $ a + c = 9 $, and $ b + d = 10 $. We seek to maximize:\\n$$\\nx + y = \\\\frac{a}{b} + \\\\frac{c}{d}\\n$$\\n\\nBy testing all valid combinations of $ a, b, c, d $ satisfying the constraints, the maximum occurs when:\\n- $ x = \\\\frac{8}{1} $, $ y = \\\\frac{1}{9} $\\n- Both are in lowest terms\\n- Numerator sum: $ 8 + 1 = 9 $\\n- Denominator sum: $ 1 + 9 = 10 $\\n\\nThis gives:\\n$$\\nx + y = \\\\frac{8}{1} + \\\\frac{1}{9} = \\\\frac{73}{9}\\n$$\\n\\nNo other combination yields a larger sum under the given constraints.\",\n    \"answer\": \"73/9\"\n}",
