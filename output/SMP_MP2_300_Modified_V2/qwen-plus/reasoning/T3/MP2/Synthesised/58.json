  "math_problem": "Rishabh has 2024 pairs of socks in a drawer. He draws socks from the drawer uniformly at random, without replacement, until he has drawn a pair of identical socks. Compute the expected number of unpaired socks he has drawn when he stops. Instead of computing the expected number of unpaired socks upon obtaining the first matching pair, simply find $k = E_1 - 1$, where $E_1$ is the expected total number of socks drawn until stopping in the case with a single pair. Let $N$ be the number of sequences of positive integers $\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots, a_{15}\\right)$ for which the polynomials $$x^{2}-a_{i} x+a_{i+1}$$ each have an integer root for every $k \\leq i \\leq (k + 14)$, setting $a_{16}=a_{1}$. Estimate $N$. An estimate of $E$ will earn $\\left\\lfloor (k + 19) \\min \\left(\\frac{N}{E}, \\frac{E}{N}\\right)^{2}\\right\\rfloor$ points.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires estimating N, the number of cyclic sequences of length 15 where each polynomial $x^2 - a_i x + a_{i+1}$ has an integer root (with $a_{16} = a_1$).\\n\\nFirst, for the sock problem: with a single pair (2 socks), the expected number of socks drawn until stopping ($E_1$) is 2 (since the second sock must match the first). Thus, $k = E_1 - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nFor the sequence problem, each $a_i$ must be a positive integer such that $a_{i+1} = r(a_i - r)$ for some integer $r$ (since the polynomial must factor into $(x - r)(x - s)$ with $r + s = a_i$ and $rs = a_{i+1}$). Valid transitions form a functional graph:\\n- **Component 1**: The constant sequence $a_i = 4$ is valid because $4 = 2(4 - 2)$, so $x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2$ has an integer root. This gives **1 sequence**.\\n- **Component 2**: A 3-cycle $6 \\\\to 8 \\\\to 7 \\\\to 6$:\\n  - $6 \\\\to 8$: $x^2 - 6x + 8 = (x - 2)(x - 4)$\\n  - $8 \\\\to 7$: $x^2 - 8x + 7 = (x - 1)(x - 7)$\\n  - $7 \\\\to 6$: $x^2 - 7x + 6 = (x - 1)(x - 6)$\\n  Since 15 is a multiple of 3, there are **3 distinct sequences** (starting at 6, 8, or 7).\\n\\nOther transitions (e.g., $6 \\\\to 5$ or $6 \\\\to 9$) lead to paths that cannot close into a cycle of length 15. No other cycles of length dividing 15 exist. Thus, $N = 1 + 3 = 4$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4\"\n}",
