  "math_problem": "A group of 101 Dalmathians participate in an election, where they each vote independently on either candidate $A$ or $B$ with equal probability. If $X$ Dalmathians voted for the winning candidate, the expected value of $X^{2}$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for positive integers $a, b$ with $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1$. Find the unique positive integer $k \\leq 103$ such that $103 \\mid a-bk$. Instead of determining the specified integer related to the expected value of the square of the number voting for the winning candidate, simply find $r = P(\\textrm{same}) + 3/2$, where $P(\\textrm{same})$ is the probability that two voters vote for the same candidate derived from the independence of their votes. Find all possible values of $\\frac{d}{a}$ where $a^{r}-6 a d+8 d^{2}=0, a \\neq 0$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute $ P(\\\\text{same}) $, the probability that two independent voters choose the same candidate. Each voter selects $ A $ or $ B $ with probability $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $. The probability both choose $ A $ is $ \\\\frac{1}{4} $, and both choose $ B $ is $ \\\\frac{1}{4} $, so $ P(\\\\text{same}) = \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{4} = \\\\frac{1}{2} $. Then $ r = P(\\\\text{same}) + \\\\frac{3}{2} = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{3}{2} = 2 $. \\n\\nNext, solve $ a^r - 6ad + 8d^2 = 0 $ with $ r = 2 $, giving $ a^2 - 6ad + 8d^2 = 0 $. Let $ k = \\\\frac{d}{a} $ (since $ a \\\\neq 0 $), so $ d = ka $. Substituting yields $ a^2 - 6a(ka) + 8(ka)^2 = 0 $, simplifying to $ 1 - 6k + 8k^2 = 0 $. Solving $ 8k^2 - 6k + 1 = 0 $ using the quadratic formula: \\n$$\\nk = \\\\frac{6 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \\\\cdot 8 \\\\cdot 1}}{2 \\\\cdot 8} = \\\\frac{6 \\\\pm 2}{16} \\\\implies k = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\text{ or } \\\\frac{1}{4}.\\n$$\\nThus, the possible values of $ \\\\frac{d}{a} $ are $ \\\\frac{1}{4} $ and $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/4, 1/2\"\n}",
