Instead of determining the value modulo 100 of the iterated binary operation on the given decreasing sequence of integers, simply find $d$, where $d$ is the tens digit of the final operand in that sequence. Find the number of 7-tuples $\\left(n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{7}\\right)$ of integers such that $$\\sum_{i=1}^{7} n_{i}^{(d + 6)}=(d + 96957)$$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding the tens digit $d$ of the final operand in the sequence $579, 569, \\\\ldots, 19, 9$. The sequence decreases by 10 each time, ending at 9. Since 9 is a single-digit number, its tens digit is 0, so $d = 0$. Next, we compute the number of 7-tuples $(n_1, \\\\ldots, n_7)$ such that $\\\\sum_{i=1}^7 n_i^{(d + 6)} = d + 96957$. Substituting $d = 0$, this becomes $\\\\sum_{i=1}^7 n_i^6 = 96957$. \\n\\nEach $n_i^6$ is non-negative, and possible values are $0, 1, 64, 729, 4096, 15625, 46656$ (since $7^6 = 117649 > 96957$). The only valid combination summing to 96957 with 7 terms is $2 \\\\times 46656 + 5 \\\\times 729 = 96957$. \\n\\n- $46656 = (\\\\pm 6)^6$ (2 choices per term)\\n- $729 = (\\\\pm 3)^6$ (2 choices per term)\\n\\nThe number of ways to choose positions for the two $46656$ terms is $\\\\binom{7}{2} = 21$. Each of these terms has 2 sign choices ($2^2 = 4$), and each of the five $729$ terms has 2 sign choices ($2^5 = 32$). Total tuples: $21 \\\\times 4 \\\\times 32 = 2688$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2688\"\n}",
