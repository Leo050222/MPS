  "math_problem": "In acute triangle $ABC$, let $H$ be the orthocenter and $D$ the foot of the altitude from $A$. The circumcircle of triangle $BHC$ intersects $AC$ at $E \\neq C$, and $AB$ at $F \\neq B$. If $BD=3, CD=7$, and $\\frac{AH}{HD}=\\frac{5}{7}$, the area of triangle $AEF$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100a+b$. Instead of finding the area of triangle $AEF$, simply find $m = \\mathrm{HD} - \\frac{3}{2}$, where $\\mathrm{HD}$ is the length of the segment from the orthocenter $H$ to the foot of the altitude $D$. Compute $\\frac{m^{3}-1}{m^{3}+1} \\cdot \\frac{3^{3}-1}{3^{3}+1} \\cdot \\frac{4^{3}-1}{4^{3}+1} \\cdot \\frac{5^{3}-1}{5^{3}+1} \\cdot \\frac{6^{3}-1}{6^{3}+1}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Given BD = 3 and CD = 7, BC = 10. Let HD = x, so AH = (5/7)x and AD = AH + HD = (12/7)x. Using coordinate geometry with D at (0,0), B at (-3,0), C at (7,0), and A at (0,h), the orthocenter H lies on the y-axis. The altitude from B to AC has slope 7/h, giving H's y-coordinate as 21/h. Thus, HD = 21/h. From AH/HD = 5/7, (h - 21/h)/(21/h) = 5/7 simplifies to h = 6. Hence, HD = 21/6 = 7/2. Then m = HD - 3/2 = 7/2 - 3/2 = 2. Compute the product: (2³-1)/(2³+1) = 7/9, (3³-1)/(3³+1) = 13/14, (4³-1)/(4³+1) = 63/65, (5³-1)/(5³+1) = 62/63, (6³-1)/(6³+1) = 215/217. Multiplying these: (7/9)(13/14)(63/65)(62/63)(215/217) = 43/63 after simplification.\",\n    \"answer\": \"43/63\"\n}",
