  "math_problem": "Regular hexagon $P_{1} P_{2} P_{3} P_{4} P_{5} P_{6}$ has side length 2. For $1 \\leq i \\leq 6$, let $C_{i}$ be a unit circle centered at $P_{i}$ and $\\ell_{i}$ be one of the internal common tangents of $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+2}$, where $C_{7}=C_{1}$ and $C_{8}=C_{2}$. Assume that the lines $\\{\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}, \\ell_{5}, \\ell_{6}\\}$ bound a regular hexagon. The area of this hexagon can be expressed as $\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of determining the value 100 times the numerator plus the denominator for the area of the bounded regular hexagon when expressed as the square root of a reduced fraction, simply find $k$, the denominator of that reduced fraction. Find all square numbers $ S_1$ and $ S_2$ such that $ S_1 - S_2 = k + 1986$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves a regular hexagon with side length 2, where each vertex is the center of a unit circle. We need to find the area of the regular hexagon formed by internal common tangents of circles centered at vertices two apart (e.g., $C_i$ and $C_{i+2}$).\\n\\n1. **Coordinate Setup**: Place the original hexagon centered at the origin with vertices $P_i$ at $(2 \\\\cos((i-1)\\\\pi/3), 2 \\\\sin((i-1)\\\\pi/3))$.\\n2. **Distance Between Centers**: For $P_i$ and $P_{i+2}$, the distance is $2\\\\sqrt{3}$ (central angle $2\\\\pi/3$).\\n3. **Internal Common Tangents**: For two unit circles separated by $2\\\\sqrt{3}$, the internal common tangents satisfy the condition that the distance from each center to the tangent line is 1, with centers on opposite sides of the line.\\n4. **Symmetry and Apothem**: The bounded hexagon is regular and concentric with the original. Using symmetry, the distance from the origin to each tangent line (apothem $h$) is derived as $h = \\\\sqrt{6}/3$.\\n5. **Area Calculation**: For a regular hexagon, area $= \\\\frac{3\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. Relating $s$ to $h$ via $h = \\\\frac{s\\\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, we find $s = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{2}}{3}$. Substituting gives area $= \\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\\n6. **Expressing Area as $\\\\sqrt{a/b}$**: Squaring the area gives $\\\\left(\\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{16}{3}$, so $a = 16$, $b = 3$ (coprime). Thus, $k = b = 3$.\\n\\nThe problem specifies to find $k$, the denominator of the reduced fraction inside the square root for the area. The subsequent part about square numbers $S_1$ and $S_2$ is irrelevant to the required answer, which is $k = 3$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
