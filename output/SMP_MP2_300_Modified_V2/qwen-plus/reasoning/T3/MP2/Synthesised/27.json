  "math_problem": "A tightrope walker stands in the center of a rope of length 32 meters. Every minute she walks forward one meter with probability $3 / 4$ and backward one meter with probability $1 / 4$. What is the probability that she reaches the end in front of her before the end behind her? Instead of computing the probability of reaching the forward end before the backward end in this biased random walk on a line, simply find $k = r + 2/3$, where $r$ is the ratio of the backward probability to the forward probability. Sam spends his days walking around the following $(k + 1) \\times (k + 1)$ grid of squares. Say that two squares are adjacent if they share a side. He starts at the square labeled $k$ and every second walks to an adjacent square. How many paths can Sam take so that the sum of the numbers on every square he visits in his path is equal to $(k + 19)$ (not counting the square he started on)?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ k $. The ratio $ r $ of backward probability to forward probability is $ \\\\frac{1/4}{3/4} = \\\\frac{1}{3} $. Then $ k = r + \\\\frac{2}{3} = \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{2}{3} = 1 $. The grid is $ (k+1) \\\\times (k+1) = 2 \\\\times 2 $. The sum required is $ k + 19 = 20 $, excluding the starting square labeled $ k = 1 $. In a 2x2 grid labeled 1 (start), 2, 3, 4, the only path that sums to 20 is alternating between 2 and 4 (e.g., 1→2→4→2→4→2→4→2), which requires 7 steps. Each step choice is forced to maintain the sum, resulting in exactly 1 valid path.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
