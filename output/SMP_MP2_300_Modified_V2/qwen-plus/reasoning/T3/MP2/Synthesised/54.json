  "math_problem": "Let $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ be a strictly increasing function such that $f(1)=1$ and $f(2n)f(2n+1)=9f(n)^{2}+3f(n)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Compute $f(137)$. Instead of computing the value of the function at the specified argument, simply find $k = f(68) - 730$, where $f(68)$ is the intermediate value of the function obtained by applying the recursive relation to reach the target argument. How many ways can the $k$ vertices of a three-dimensional cube be colored red and blue such that no two points connected by an edge are both red? Rotations and reflections of a given coloring are considered distinct.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first analyze the function $ f: \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{N} $ defined by the recurrence:\\n\\n- $ f(1) = 1 $\\n- $ f(2n)f(2n+1) = 9f(n)^2 + 3f(n) $\\n\\nThis recurrence suggests a pattern where $ f(n) $ can be interpreted as the base-3 representation of the binary digits of $ n $. Specifically, for any $ n $, if we write $ n $ in binary and interpret that string as a base-3 number, we get $ f(n) $.\\n\\nFor example:\\n- $ n = 1 $ (binary: `1`) → $ f(1) = 1 $\\n- $ n = 2 $ (binary: `10`) → $ f(2) = 3 $\\n- $ n = 3 $ (binary: `11`) → $ f(3) = 4 $\\n- $ n = 4 $ (binary: `100`) → $ f(4) = 9 $\\n\\nThis pattern holds because the recurrence splits into:\\n- $ f(2n) = 3f(n) $\\n- $ f(2n+1) = 3f(n) + 1 $\\n\\nThese correspond to appending a `0` or `1` in base-3, respectively.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Compute $ f(68) $\\n\\nConvert $ 68 $ to binary:\\n$$\\n68 = 64 + 4 = 2^6 + 2^2 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\text{binary: } 1000100\\n$$\\n\\nInterpret this binary string as a base-3 number:\\n$$\\nf(68) = 1 \\\\cdot 3^6 + 0 \\\\cdot 3^5 + 0 \\\\cdot 3^4 + 0 \\\\cdot 3^3 + 1 \\\\cdot 3^2 + 0 \\\\cdot 3^1 + 0 \\\\cdot 3^0 = 729 + 9 = 738\\n$$\\n\\nThus,\\n$$\\nk = f(68) - 730 = 738 - 730 = 8\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Count Valid Colorings of a Cube\\n\\nWe are asked to count the number of ways to color the **8 vertices** of a cube with red and blue such that **no two adjacent vertices are both red**, and **rotations/reflections are considered distinct**.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of **independent sets** in the cube graph $ Q_3 $, where each vertex represents a cube vertex, and edges represent adjacency.\\n\\nThe cube graph $ Q_3 $ has:\\n- 8 vertices\\n- 12 edges\\n- Maximum independent set size = 4\\n\\nBy enumerating all possible independent sets (subsets of vertices with no two adjacent), we find:\\n\\n| Size | Count |\\n|------|-------|\\n| 0    | 1     |\\n| 1    | 8     |\\n| 2    | 16    |\\n| 3    | 8     |\\n| 4    | 2     |\\n\\nTotal = $ 1 + 8 + 16 + 8 + 2 = 35 $\\n\\nSince rotations and reflections are considered **distinct**, we do not factor out symmetries. Thus, the total number of valid colorings is exactly the number of independent sets in $ Q_3 $, which is **35**.\",\n    \"answer\": \"35\"\n}",
