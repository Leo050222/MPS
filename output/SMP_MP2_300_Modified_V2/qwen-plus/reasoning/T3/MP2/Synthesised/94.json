  "math_problem": "Suppose that there are real numbers $a, b, c \\geq 1$ and that there are positive reals $x, y, z$ such that $$\\begin{aligned} a^{x}+b^{y}+c^{z} & =4 \\\\\\\\ x a^{x}+y b^{y}+z c^{z} & =6 \\\\\\\\ x^{2} a^{x}+y^{2} b^{y}+z^{2} c^{z} & =9 \\end{aligned}$$ What is the maximum possible value of $c$ ? Instead of determining the maximum possible value of $c$, simply find $m = k + \\frac{3}{2}$, where $k$ is the common value of the exponents $x, y, z$ satisfying the first two given equations when the exponents are equal. Let $P$ be a polynomial such that $P(x)=P(0)+P(1) x+P(2) x^{2}$ and $P(-1)=1$. Compute $P(m)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, consider the case where exponents are equal: $x = y = z = k$. The first equation becomes $a^k + b^k + c^k = 4$, and the second equation becomes $k(a^k + b^k + c^k) = 6$. Substituting the first into the second gives $4k = 6$, so $k = \\\\frac{3}{2}$. Then $m = k + \\\\frac{3}{2} = \\\\frac{3}{2} + \\\\frac{3}{2} = 3$.\\n\\nNext, define the polynomial $P(x) = P(0) + P(1)x + P(2)x^2$. Let $P(0) = A$, $P(1) = B$, $P(2) = C$. Then $P(x) = A + Bx + Cx^2$. By definition:\\n- $P(1) = A + B + C = B \\\\implies A + C = 0$,\\n- $P(2) = A + 2B + 4C = C \\\\implies A + 2B + 3C = 0$,\\n- $P(-1) = A - B + C = 1$.\\n\\nFrom $A = -C$, substitute into the second equation: $-C + 2B + 3C = 0 \\\\implies 2B + 2C = 0 \\\\implies B = -C$. Substitute $A = -C$ and $B = -C$ into $P(-1)$: $-C - (-C) + C = 1 \\\\implies C = 1$. Thus, $A = -1$, $B = -1$, and $P(x) = x^2 - x - 1$. Evaluating at $m = 3$: $P(3) = 9 - 3 - 1 = 5$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
