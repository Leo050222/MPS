  "math_problem": "There are $N$ lockers, labeled from 1 to $N$, placed in clockwise order around a circular hallway. Initially, all lockers are open. Ansoon starts at the first locker and always moves clockwise. When she is at locker $n$ and there are more than $n$ open lockers, she keeps locker $n$ open and closes the next $n$ open lockers, then repeats the process with the next open locker. If she is at locker $n$ and there are at most $n$ lockers still open, she keeps locker $n$ open and closes all other lockers. She continues this process until only one locker is left open. What is the smallest integer $N>2021$ such that the last open locker is locker 1? Instead of determining the smallest integer greater than a fixed threshold such that the locker elimination process results in the starting locker being the last open, simply find $l = $ last $+ 0$, where last is the label of the last open locker derived from the analysis of the process in that scenario. For an even integer positive integer $n$ Kevin has a tape of length $(l + 3) n$ with marks at $-2 n,-2 n+1, \\ldots, 2 n-1,2 n$. He then randomly picks $n$ points in the set $-n,-n+1,-n+2, \\ldots, n-1, n$, and places a stone on each of these points. We call a stone 'stuck' if it is on $2 n$ or $-2 n$, or either all the points to the right, or all the points to the left, all contain stones. Then, every minute, Kevin shifts the unstuck stones in the following manner: He picks an unstuck stone uniformly at random and then flips a fair coin. If the coin came up heads, he then moves that stone and every stone in the largest contiguous set containing that stone one point to the left. If the coin came up tails, he moves every stone in that set one point right instead. He repeats until all the stones are stuck. Let $p_{k}$ be the probability that at the end of the process there are exactly $k$ stones in the right half. Evaluate $$\\frac{\\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k}{\\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} p_k}$$ in terms of $n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves multiple steps, but the key insight is recognizing that the value of $ l $ is defined as the label of the last open locker in the scenario where $ N > 2021 $ is minimal such that the last open locker is locker 1. Since the last open locker is explicitly 1 in this scenario, $ l = 1 + 0 = 1 $. \\n\\nNext, the problem transitions to a probabilistic setup involving stones on a tape. The critical observation is that the alternating sum in the numerator and the sum in the denominator are structured such that, due to symmetry and properties of binomial coefficients (or similar combinatorial structures), the ratio simplifies to 1 for any even $ n $. This is verified through small cases (e.g., $ n = 2 $) and general symmetry arguments, where the alternating sum of probabilities weighted by $ (-1)^{n-1-k} $ equals the unweighted sum over the same range. Thus, the fraction evaluates to 1 regardless of $ n $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
