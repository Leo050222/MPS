  "math_problem": "Let $f(x)=x^{2}-2$, and let $f^{n}$ denote the function $f$ applied $n$ times. Consider the sequence $(L_n)$ defined by $L_0 = 2$, $L_1 = 1$, and $L_{n+2} = L_{n+1} + L_n$ for $n \\geq 0$. Compute the remainder when $f^{24}(18)$ is divided by 89. Instead of determining the value modulo the given prime of the result of iterating the quadratic function the specified number of times starting from the given initial value, simply find $d = L_8 - 42$, where $L_8$ is the eighth term of the sequence $(L_n)$ defined in the problem. How many polynomials of degree exactly $d$ with real coefficients send the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ to a permutation of itself?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding $d = L_8 - 42$, where $L_n$ is defined by $L_0 = 2$, $L_1 = 1$, and $L_{n+2} = L_{n+1} + L_n$.

A polynomial of degree at most 5 is uniquely determined by its values at 6 distinct points (via Lagrange interpolation). For a permutation $\\\\sigma$ of $\\\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\\\}$, there is a unique interpolating polynomial $P_\\\\sigma$ of degree at most 5 such that $P_\\\\sigma(i) = \\\\sigma(i)$ for $i = 1, \\\\dots, 6$.\\n\\nThe degree of $P_\\\\sigma$ is exactly 5 if and only if it is not a polynomial of degree at most 4. The only permutations for which $P_\\\\sigma$ has degree at most 4 are those where the 5th finite difference is zero. However, for the set $\\\\{1, 2, \\\\dots, 6\\\\}$, the only permutations that can be interpolated by a polynomial of degree at most 4 (and in fact, degree at most 1) are the affine permutations: the identity permutation ($\\\\sigma(i) = i$) and the reverse permutation ($\\\\sigma(i) = 7 - i$). These correspond to linear polynomials, which have degree 1 (hence degree $\\\\leq 4$).\\n\\nAll other permutations require a polynomial of degree exactly 5. There are $6! = 720$ total permutations. Subtracting the 2 affine permutations, the number of polynomials of degree exactly 5 is $720 - 2 = 718$.\", \"answer\": \"718\"}",
