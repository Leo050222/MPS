  "math_problem": "I have 8 unit cubes of different colors, which I want to glue together into a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ cube. How many distinct $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ cubes can I make? Rotations of the same cube are not considered distinct, but reflections are. Instead of determining the number of distinct cubes up to rotations, simply find $k = m - 34$, where $m$ is the number of ways to choose which of the remaining cubes occupy the positions adjacent to the fixed cube, derived from the analysis of fixing one cube's position to account for rotational symmetry. Find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial $P(x)=x^{4}-(k + 28) x^{3}+a x^{2}+b x+c$, given that $P(5)=(k + 10), P(11)=(k + 16)$, and $P(17)=(k + 22)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the combinatorial setup involving a $2 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 2$ cube made from 8 distinct unit cubes. The key is to determine $k = m - 34$, where $m$ represents the number of distinct ways to assign the remaining 7 cubes to positions adjacent to a fixed cube, accounting for rotational symmetry.\\n\\n### Step 1: Fixing One Cube and Counting Adjacent Assignments\\n\\n- A $2 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 2$ cube has 8 corners (positions).\\n- Fixing one cube at a specific corner eliminates rotational symmetries that move it. The rotation group of the cube has 24 elements, and since there are 8 corners, the stabilizer of a single corner has size $\\\\frac{24}{8} = 3$.\\n- The three positions adjacent to the fixed corner form an orbit under this stabilizer group (rotations around the space diagonal through the fixed corner).\\n- To count the number of distinct assignments of the remaining 7 cubes to these 3 adjacent positions, consider all permutations of 3 out of 7 cubes: $P(7,3) = 7 \\\\times 6 \\\\times 5 = 210$.\\n- Since the stabilizer acts as a cyclic group of order 3 on these positions, each orbit contains 3 equivalent assignments. Thus, the number of distinct assignments is:\\n  $$\\n  m = \\\\frac{210}{3} = 70\\n  $$\\n- Therefore, $k = m - 34 = 70 - 34 = 36$.\\n\\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Polynomial\\n\\nWe are given the polynomial:\\n$$\\nP(x) = x^4 - (k + 28)x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c\\n$$\\nwith $k = 36$, so:\\n$$\\nP(x) = x^4 - 64x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c\\n$$\\nWe are also given:\\n- $P(5) = k + 10 = 46$\\n- $P(11) = k + 16 = 52$\\n- $P(17) = k + 22 = 58$\\n\\nLet’s define a new function:\\n$$\\nQ(x) = P(x) - (x + 41)\\n$$\\nThis function satisfies:\\n- $Q(5) = 0$\\n- $Q(11) = 0$\\n- $Q(17) = 0$\\n\\nThus, $Q(x)$ has roots at $x = 5, 11, 17$, and since $P(x)$ is a quartic, $Q(x)$ must be a quartic with one more root $d$. So:\\n$$\\nQ(x) = (x - 5)(x - 11)(x - 17)(x - d)\\n$$\\n$$\\nP(x) = (x - 5)(x - 11)(x - 17)(x - d) + x + 41\\n$$\\n\\nThe coefficient of $x^3$ in $P(x)$ is $-(5 + 11 + 17 + d) = -64$, so:\\n$$\\n5 + 11 + 17 + d = 64 \\\\Rightarrow d = 31\\n$$\\n\\nNow compute the sum of coefficients of $P(x)$, which is $P(1)$:\\n$$\\nP(1) = (1 - 5)(1 - 11)(1 - 17)(1 - 31) + 1 + 41\\n$$\\n$$\\n= (-4)(-10)(-16)(-30) + 42 = 19200 + 42 = 19242\\n$$\",\n    \"answer\": \"19242\"\n}",
