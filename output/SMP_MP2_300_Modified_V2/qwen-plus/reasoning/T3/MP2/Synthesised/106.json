  "math_problem": "The altitudes of a triangle are $12$, $15$, and $20$.  What is the area of this triangle? Instead of finding the area of the triangle, simply find $k = x - 3$, where $x$ is the scaling factor such that the side lengths are $5x$ for the longest side, $4x$ for the middle-length side, and $3x$ for the shortest side. Find all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of complex numbers with $a^{k}+b^{k} \\neq 0$, $a+\\frac{10b}{a^{k}+b^{k}}=5$, and $b+\\frac{10a}{a^{k}+b^{k}}=4$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves finding ordered pairs (a, b) of complex numbers given specific equations. First, the scaling factor x for the triangle's sides (5x, 4x, 3x) is determined using the relationship between altitudes and side lengths. The altitudes 12, 15, 20 correspond to sides inversely proportional to these values, leading to side ratios 5:4:3. Using the area formula for a right triangle (3-4-5), the scaling factor x is found to be 5, so k = x - 3 = 2.\\n\\nWith k = 2, the equations become:\\na + (10b)/(a² + b²) = 5,\\nb + (10a)/(a² + b²) = 4.\\nLetting C = 10/(a² + b²), the system is solved as a linear system in a and b. Solving the resulting quartic equation for C yields four solutions, leading to four ordered pairs (a, b):\\n- (4, 2) from C = 1/2,\\n- (1, 2) from C = 2,\\n- (5/2, (4 - 3i)/2) from C = (4 + 3i)/5,\\n- (5/2, (4 + 3i)/2) from C = (4 - 3i)/5.\\nAll pairs satisfy the conditions and a² + b² ≠ 0.\",\n    \"answer\": \"[(4, 2), (1, 2), (5/2, (4 - 3i)/2), (5/2, (4 + 3i)/2)]\"\n}",
