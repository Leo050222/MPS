  "math_problem": "A person starts at position (0,0,0) in the space {0,1}^3. Each minute, one of the three coordinates is chosen uniformly at random and flipped (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0). After an even number of minutes, the position always has an even number of 1's. In terms of $k$, for $k>0$ how likely is he to be back where he started after $2 k$ minutes? Instead of determining the return probability as a function of $k$, simply find $m = q_0 + 9/4$, where $q_0$ is the initial deviation of the return probability from its limiting value derived from the recurrence relation for returns to the origin. Compute $\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{2 \\sin \\theta + m \\cos \\theta - m}{13 \\cos \\theta - 5} \\,\\mathrm{d} \\theta$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves a random walk on the 3-dimensional hypercube {0,1}^3 starting at (0,0,0). Each step flips one coordinate uniformly at random. The return probability to the origin after 2k steps is derived using eigenvalues of the transition matrix. For the hypercube, the return probability is:\\n\\n$$\\np_{2k}(0) = \\\\frac{1}{8} \\\\left[ 1 + 3\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right)^{2k} + 3\\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right)^{2k} + (-1)^{2k} \\\\right] = \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{9}\\\\right)^k.\\n$$\\n\\nThe limiting value as $ k \\\\to \\\\infty $ is $ \\\\frac{1}{4} $. The deviation from the limit is $ q_k = \\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{9}\\\\right)^k $. The initial deviation $ q_0 $ (at $ k=0 $) is $ \\\\frac{3}{4} $. Thus, $ m = q_0 + \\\\frac{9}{4} = \\\\frac{3}{4} + \\\\frac{9}{4} = 3 $.\\n\\nNext, compute the integral:\\n$$\\n\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\pi} \\\\frac{2 \\\\sin \\\\theta + 3 \\\\cos \\\\theta - 3}{13 \\\\cos \\\\theta - 5} \\\\, d\\\\theta.\\n$$\\n\\nSplit the numerator as $ 2 \\\\sin \\\\theta + 3(\\\\cos \\\\theta - 1) $.
