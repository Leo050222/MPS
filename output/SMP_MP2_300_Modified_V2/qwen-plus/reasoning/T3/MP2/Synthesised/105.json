  "math_problem": "Consider a sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ of integers, satisfying $a_1=1, a_2=2$ and $a_{n+1}$ is the largest prime divisor of $a_1+a_2+\\ldots+a_n$. Find $a_{100}$. Instead of determining the final term of the sequence, simply find $m$, the sum of the two consecutive terms immediately preceding that final term. Alice starts with the number $(m - 100)$. She can apply $m$ operations on her number. In each operation, she can either add 1 to her number, or square her number. After applying all operations, her score is the minimum distance from her number to any perfect square. What is the maximum score she can attain?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The sequence $\\\\{a_n\\\\}$ starts with $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 2$, and each subsequent term $a_{n+1}$ is the largest prime divisor of the sum $S_n = a_1 + \\\\cdots + a_n$. By computing the sequence, we observe a pattern where each prime $p$ appears for a number of terms equal to $q - s$, where $q$ is the next prime after $p$ and $s$ is the previous prime. \\n\\n- $a_{98} = 47$ (last term of the prime 47's run, which spans indices 89 to 98).\\n- $a_{99} = 53$ (first term of the next prime, 53).\\n- Thus, $m = a_{98} + a_{99} = 47 + 53 = 100$.\\n\\nAlice starts with $m - 100 = 0$ and applies $m = 100$ operations (each either +1 or square). To maximize the minimum distance to any perfect square:\\n- Use 2 operations to reach 2 (+1, +1).\\n- Square 4 times (operations 3–6) to reach $65536 = 2^{16}$.\\n- Apply 94 +1 operations (total 100 operations) to reach $65536 + 94 = 65630$.\\n- The nearest squares are $256^2 = 65536$ (distance 94) and $257^2 = 66049$ (distance 419).\\n- The minimum distance is 94, which is the maximum achievable.\", \"answer\": \"94\"}",
