  "math_problem": "Find the smallest value that the expression takes $x^4 + y^4 - x^2y - xy^2$, for positive numbers $x$ and $y$ satisfying $x + y \\le 1$. Instead of determining the minimal value attained by the given quartic expression over the region of positive variables summing to at most one, simply find $k$ equal to that minimal value plus $\\frac{401}{8}$. An integer $n$ is chosen uniformly at random from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 2023!\\}$. Compute the probability that $$\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(n^{n}+k, n+1\\right)=1$$",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find the minimal value of $x^4 + y^4 - x^2y - xy^2$ for positive $x, y$ with $x + y \\\\leq 1$. By symmetry and boundary analysis, the minimum occurs at $x = y = \\\\frac{1}{2}$ (on $x + y = 1$), yielding $-\\\\frac{1}{8}$. Thus, $k = -\\\\frac{1}{8} + \\\\frac{401}{8} = 50$.\\n\\nNext, compute the probability that $\\\\gcd(n^n + 50, n + 1) = 1$ for $n$ uniformly random in $\\\\{1, 2, \\\\ldots, 2023!\\\\}$. Using modular arithmetic:\\n- For even $n$, $n^n + 50 \\\\equiv 1 + 50 = 51 \\\\mod (n+1)$, so $\\\\gcd(n^n + 50, n+1) = \\\\gcd(n+1, 51)$. This equals 1 iff $n+1$ is not divisible by 3 or 17.\\n- For odd $n$, $n^n + 50 \\\\equiv -1 + 50 = 49 \\\\mod (n+1)$, so $\\\\gcd(n^n + 50, n+1) = \\\\gcd(n+1, 49)$. This equals 1 iff $n+1$ is not divisible by 7.\\n\\nSince $2023!$ is divisible by all small integers, the density of favorable $n$ is:\\n- For even $n$ (half of all $n$): proportion of odd $n+1$ not divisible by 3 or 17 is $\\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{16}{17} = \\\\frac{32}{51}$.\\n- For odd $n$ (half of all $n$): proportion of even $n+1$ not divisible by 7 is $\\\\frac{6}{7}$.\\n\\nTotal probability: $\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{32}{51} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{6}{7} = \\\\frac{16}{51} + \\\\frac{3}{7} = \\\\frac{265}{357}$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"265/357\"\n}",
