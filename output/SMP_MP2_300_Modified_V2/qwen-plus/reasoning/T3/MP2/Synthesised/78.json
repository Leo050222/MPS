  "math_problem": "Let $Q(x)=x^{2}+2x+3$, and suppose that $P(x)$ is a polynomial such that $P(Q(x))=x^{6}+6x^{5}+18x^{4}+32x^{3}+35x^{2}+22x+8$. Compute $P(2)$. Instead of computing $P(2)$, simply find $k = Q(r) - 1$, where $r$ is the unique real root of the derivative of $Q$. Does there exist an irrational number $\\alpha>k$ such that $\\left\\lfloor\\alpha^{n}\\right\\rfloor \\equiv $(k - 1)$ \\quad(\\bmod $(k + 2016)$)$ for all integers $n \\geq k$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute the derivative of $ Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3 $, which is $ Q'(x) = 2x + 2 $. The unique real root $ r $ satisfies $ 2x + 2 = 0 $, so $ r = -1 $. Evaluate $ Q(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 3 = 2 $. Thus, $ k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 $. \\n\\nNext, determine if there exists an irrational $ \\\\alpha > 1 $ such that $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $ for all $ n \\\\geq 1 $. Since $ k = 1 $, the condition simplifies to $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ being divisible by 2017 for all $ n \\\\geq 1 $. \\n\\nConstruct $ \\\\alpha $ by successive approximation: choose intervals for $ \\\\alpha $ such that $ \\\\alpha^n \\\\in [2017 \\\\cdot m_n, 2017 \\\\cdot m_n + 1) $ for integers $ m_n $. For $ n = 1 $, $ \\\\alpha \\\\in [2017, 2018) $. For $ n = 2 $, select $ \\\\alpha $ within a subinterval where $ \\\\alpha^2 $ lies in a range yielding $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^2 \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $. Repeat this process for all $ n $, ensuring each interval is non-empty and nested. By the nested interval theorem, the intersection contains at least one real number. Avoiding rational numbers in the construction ensures $ \\\\alpha $ is irrational. Thus, such an $ \\\\alpha $ exists.\",\n    \"answer\": \"yes\"\n}",
