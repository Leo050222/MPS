  "math_problem": "Marcus and four of his relatives are at a party. Each pair of the five people are either friends or enemies. For any two enemies, there is no person that they are both friends with. In how many ways is this possible? Instead of determining the total number of valid friendship and enmity assignments among the five people, simply find $q = s - 1$, where $s$ is the number of such assignments in which no two people are friends. How many lattice points are enclosed by the triangle with vertices $(q,99),((q + 5),100)$, and $((q + 2003),500)$? Don't count boundary points.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine q = s - 1 where s is the number of valid assignments with no two people friends. If no two people are friends, all pairs are enemies. The condition states that any two enemies have no common friend. Since there are no friends, this condition is vacuously true, so the all-enemies assignment is valid. There's exactly 1 such assignment, so s = 1 and q = 0.\\n\\nNext, find lattice points enclosed by the triangle with vertices (0,99), (5,100), (2003,500) (excluding boundaries). Using Pick's Theorem: Area A = 1 (via shoelace formula). Boundary points B = 4 (calculated via gcd for each edge). Pick's formula: A = I + B/2 - 1 ⇒ 1 = I + 2 - 1 ⇒ I = 0.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
