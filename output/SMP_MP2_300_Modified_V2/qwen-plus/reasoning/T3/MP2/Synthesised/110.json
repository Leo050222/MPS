  "math_problem": "Find all triples of primes $(p,q,r)$ satisfying $3p^{4}-5q^{4}-4r^{2}=26$. Instead of determining all triples of primes that satisfy the given Diophantine equation, simply find $m = r - 16$, where $r$ is the prime in the solution triple. Triangle $A B C$ has perimeter $(m - 2)$. Its three altitudes form the side lengths of a triangle. Find the set of all possible values of $\\min (A B, B C, C A)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the Diophantine equation $3p^4 - 5q^4 - 4r^2 = 26$ for prime triples $(p, q, r)$. Analyzing modulo 3 shows $q$ must be 3 (the only prime where $q^4 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod 3$). Substituting $q = 3$ gives $3p^4 - 4r^2 = 431$. Testing small primes, $p = 5$ yields $r = 19$ (prime), satisfying the equation. Thus, $r = 19$, so $m = r - 16 = 3$. The perimeter of triangle $ABC$ is $m - 2 = 1$. For the altitudes to form a triangle, the reciprocals of the sides must satisfy triangle inequalities. Let $a = \\\\min(AB, BC, CA)$. The critical condition $\\\\frac{1}{b} + \\\\frac{1}{c} > \\\\frac{1}{a}$ (with $a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c$ and $a + b + c = 1$) leads to $a > \\\\frac{1}{5}$. The upper bound $a \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{3}$ comes from $a$ being the smallest side. All values in $(\\\\frac{1}{5}, \\\\frac{1}{3}]$ are valid.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(1/5, 1/3]\"\n}",
