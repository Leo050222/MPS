  "math_problem": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $N$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen. James writes down three integers. Alex picks some two of those integers, takes the average of them, and adds the result to the third integer. If the possible final results Alex could get are $(N - 86)$, 13, and 37, what are the three integers James originally chose?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine N, the number of students with a given antigen. With 8 antigens, each student's blood type is a unique subset of these antigens (256 students = 2^8 subsets). For any specific antigen, half of all subsets include it (2^7 = 128), so N = 128. Next, N - 86 = 42. The problem states the possible results from Alex's operations are 42, 13, and 37. Let the three integers be a, b, c. The operations yield three equations: (a+b)/2 + c, (a+c)/2 + b, (b+c)/2 + a. Multiplying by 2 gives linear equations. Summing all three results: 42 + 13 + 37 = 92, so the sum of the integers S = 92/2 = 46. Solving for each integer using S: a = 2*37 - 46 = 28, b = 2*13 - 46 = -20, c = 2*42 - 46 = 38. Verifying confirms these values produce the required results.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-20, 28, 38\"\n}",
