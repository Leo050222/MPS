  "math_problem": "Tetrahedron $A B C D$ with volume 1 is inscribed in circumsphere $\\omega$ such that $A B=A C=A D=2$ and $B C \\cdot C D \\cdot D B=16$. Find the radius of $\\omega$. Instead of determining the circumradius of the sphere containing all four vertices, simply find $\\delta = AX - \\frac{7}{10}$, where $AX$ is the altitude from vertex $A$ to the plane of face $BCD$. In the Cartesian plane, let $A=(0,0)$, $B=(200,100)$, and $C=(30,330)$. Compute the number of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of integers so that $\\left(x+\\delta, y+\\delta\\right)$ is in the interior of triangle $A B C$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve for δ in the tetrahedron problem. Given AB = AC = AD = 2, the projection of A onto plane BCD (point X) is the circumcenter of triangle BCD. Let AX = h (altitude), and let r be the circumradius of BCD. From Pythagoras: 4 = h² + r². The volume of the tetrahedron is 1 = (1/3) * area(BCD) * h ⇒ area(BCD) = 3/h. Using the triangle area formula area = (BC·CD·DB)/(4r) = 16/(4r) = 4/r, so 3/h = 4/r ⇒ r = 4h/3. Substituting into 4 = h² + r² gives h = 6/5. Thus, δ = AX - 7/10 = 6/5 - 7/10 = 1/2.\\n\\nNext, compute the number of integer pairs (x, y) such that (x + δ, y + δ) = (x + 0.5, y + 0.5) is in the interior of triangle ABC with A=(0,0), B=(200,100), C=(30,330). The interior conditions for (u, v) = (x + 0.5, y + 0.5) are:\\n- v > (1/2)u (below AB),\\n- v < 11u (below AC),\\n- 23u + 17v < 6300 (below BC).\\n\\nTranslating to integer (x, y):\\n- x ≤ 2y (from v > (1/2)u),\\n- y ≤ 11x + 4 (from v < 11u),\\n- 23x + 17y ≤ 6279 (from 23u + 17v < 6300, since x, y integers).\\n\\nSplit into cases:\\n- **Case 1 (x = 0 to 29)**: Upper bound from AC. For even x=2k, count = 21k + 5 (sum 2280); for odd x=2k+1, count = 21k + 15 (sum 2430). Total: 4710.\\n- **Case 2 (x = 30 to 199)**: Upper bound from BC. Sum of valid y values computed as 26770.\\n\\nTotal count = 4710 + 26770 = 31480. Verified via area (31500) minus half the boundary half-integer points (40/2 = 20), yielding 31500 - 20 = 31480.\",\n    \"answer\": \"31480\"\n}",
