Instead of determining the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial, simply find \\(k = a_3 - 27\\), where \\(a_3\\) is the coefficient of \\(x^3\\).

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the polynomial coefficients. Given $P(10) = 331633$ and $P(-10) = 273373$, we use the identities:\\n- $P(10) + P(-10) = 2(a_0 + 100a_2 + 10000a_4 + \\\\cdots) = 605006 \\\\implies a_0 + 100a_2 + 10000a_4 + \\\\cdots = 302503$\\n- $P(10) - P(-10) = 2(10a_1 + 1000a_3 + 100000a_5 + \\\\cdots) = 58260 \\\\implies 10a_1 + 1000a_3 + 100000a_5 + \\\\cdots = 29130$\\n\\nFrom the second equation, dividing by 10 gives $a_1 + 100a_3 + \\\\cdots = 2913$. Since coefficients are less than 100, $a_3 = 29$ (as $100 \\\\times 29 = 2900$, leaving $a_1 = 13$). Thus, $k = a_3 - 27 = 2$.\\n\\nNext, for primitive Pythagorean triples $(m^2 - n^2, 2mn, m^2 + n^2)$ with $\\\\gcd(m,n)=1$ and $m > n$, compute $\\\\frac{P^k}{A} = \\\\frac{P^2}{A}$. Here, $P = 2m(m + n)$ and $A = mn(m^2 - n^2)$. Simplifying:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{P^2}{A} = \\\\frac{4m^2(m + n)^2}{mn(m - n)(m + n)} = \\\\frac{4m(m + n)}{n(m - n)}\\n$$\\n\\nAnalyzing divisibility and constraints ($\\\\gcd(m,n)=1$, $m,n$ not both odd), valid $n$ values are divisors of 4 (1, 2, 4). Testing:\\n- $n=1, m=2$: $\\\\frac{4 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 3}{1 \\\\cdot 1} = 24$\\n- $n=2, m=3$: $\\\\frac{2 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 5}{1 \\\\cdot 1} = 30$\\n- $n=4, m=5$: $\\\\frac{5 \\\\cdot 9}{1 \\\\cdot 1} = 45$\\n\\nThe largest integral value is 45.\",\n    \"answer\": \"45\"\n}",
