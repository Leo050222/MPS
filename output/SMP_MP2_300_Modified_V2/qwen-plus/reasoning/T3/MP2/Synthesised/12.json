  "math_problem": "A function $f$ satisfies, for all nonnegative integers $x$ and $y$: - $f(0, x)=f(x, 0)=x$ - If $x \\geq y \\geq 0, f(x, y)=f(x-y, y)+1$ - If $y \\geq x \\geq 0, f(x, y)=f(x, y-x)+1$ Find the maximum value of $f$ over $0 \\leq x, y \\leq 100$. Instead of finding the maximum value of the function over the domain of nonnegative integers up to the given bound, simply find $k = f(100,100) - 97$, where $f(100,100)$ is the value of the function at equal arguments equal to the upper bound derived from the recursive definition. A convex quadrilateral is determined by the points of intersection of the curves \\( x^{k}+y^{4}=100 \\) and \\( x y=k \\); determine its area.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The function $ f $ is defined recursively. For $ f(100, 100) $, since $ x = y = 100 $, the rule $ f(x, y) = f(x - y, y) + 1 $ applies, leading to $ f(100, 100) = f(0, 100) + 1 = 100 + 1 = 101 $. Thus, $ k = f(100, 100) - 97 = 101 - 97 = 4 $. \\n\\nNext, the curves $ x^4 + y^4 = 100 $ and $ xy = 4 $ intersect at four points due to symmetry. Solving $ xy = 4 $ for $ y $ and substituting into $ x^4 + y^4 = 100 $ gives $ x^8 - 100x^4 + 256 = 0 $. Letting $ u = x^4 $, the quadratic equation $ u^2 - 100u + 256 = 0 $ has solutions $ u = 50 \\\\pm 2\\\\sqrt{561} $. The positive intersection points in the first quadrant are $ (a, b) $ and $ (b, a) $ where $ a^4 = 50 + 2\\\\sqrt{561} $, $ b^4 = 50 - 2\\\\sqrt{561} $, and $ ab = 4 $. \\n\\nUsing symmetry and the shoelace formula, the area of the convex quadrilateral formed by the intersection points $ (a, b) $, $ (b, a) $, $ (-a, -b) $, $ (-b, -a) $ is calculated. Key steps include recognizing $ a^2 + b^2 = \\\\sqrt{132} $ and $ (a^2 - b^2)^2 = 68 $, leading to $ a^2 - b^2 = 2\\\\sqrt{17} $. The area is $ 2(a^2 - b^2) = 4\\\\sqrt{17} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4\\\\sqrt{17}\"\n}",
