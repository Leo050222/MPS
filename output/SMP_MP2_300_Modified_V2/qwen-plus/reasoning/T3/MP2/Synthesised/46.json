  "math_problem": "Determine the number of integers $2 \\leq n \\leq 2016$ such that $n^{n}-1$ is divisible by $2,3,5,7$. Instead of determining the number of integers in the given range satisfying the specified modular congruence conditions, simply find $m = \\gcd(n,6) - 1$, where $\\gcd(n,6)$ is the greatest common divisor between such an integer $n$ and $6$, derived from the analysis that such $n$ must be coprime to the primes $2$ and $3$. Assume the quartic $x^{4}-a x^{3}+b x^{2}-a x+d=m$ has four real roots $m + \\frac{1}{2} \\leq x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4} \\leq m + 2$. Find the maximum possible value of $\\frac{\\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\\right)\\left(x_{1}+x_{3}\\right) x_{4}}{\\left(x_{4}+x_{2}\\right)\\left(x_{4}+x_{3}\\right) x_{1}}$ (over all valid choices of $\\left.a, b, d\\right)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires determining $ m = \\\\gcd(n, 6) - 1 $ where $ n $ must be coprime to 2 and 3 (as $ n^n - 1 $ must be divisible by 2 and 3). Since $ \\\\gcd(n, 6) = 1 $ for such $ n $, $ m = 0 $. The quartic equation becomes $ x^4 - a x^3 + b x^2 - a x + d = 0 $ with roots in $ [\\\\frac{1}{2}, 2] $. Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of roots equals the sum of products of roots three at a time. By analyzing the expression to maximize, $ \\\\frac{(x_1 + x_2)(x_1 + x_3)x_4}{(x_4 + x_2)(x_4 + x_3)x_1} $, and considering valid root configurations (e.g., roots $ \\\\frac{1}{2}, 2, 1, 1 $), the maximum value occurs when roots are labeled to exploit symmetry and boundary values. The maximum value is found to be $ \\\\frac{5}{4} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5/4\"\n}",
