  "math_problem": "For how many positive integers $a$ does the polynomial $x^{2}-a x+a$ have an integer root? Instead of counting the positive integers $a$ such that the given quadratic polynomial has an integer root, simply find $k = a + 7$, where $a$ is a positive integer such that $x^{2} - a x + a$ has an integer root. Marisa has two identical cubical dice labeled with the numbers \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\). However, the two dice are not fair, meaning that they can land on each face with different probability. Marisa rolls the two dice and calculates their sum. Given that the sum is 2 with probability 0.04, and 12 with probability 0.01, the maximum possible probability of the sum being $k$ is $p$. Compute $\\lfloor (k + 93) p \\rfloor$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve for positive integers $a$ such that $x^2 - ax + a$ has an integer root. Let $r$ be an integer root, then $r^2 - ar + a = 0 \\\\implies a = \\\\frac{r^2}{r - 1}$. For $a$ to be a positive integer, $r - 1$ must divide $r^2$. Rewriting $a = r + 1 + \\\\frac{1}{r - 1}$, $\\\\frac{1}{r - 1}$ must be integer, so $r - 1 = \\\\pm 1$. $r = 2$ gives $a = 4$ (valid), $r = 0$ gives $a = 0$ (invalid). Thus, $a = 4$, so $k = a + 7 = 11$.\\n\\nNext, consider Marisa's dice. Let $p_i$ be the probability of rolling $i$ on one die. Sum 2 has probability $p_1^2 = 0.04 \\\\implies p_1 = 0.2$. Sum 12 has probability $p_6^2 = 0.01 \\\\implies p_6 = 0.1$. Sum $k = 11$ occurs for $(5,6)$ and $(6,5)$, so probability $2p_5p_6$. To maximize this, maximize $p_5$. With $p_1 + p_6 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 1$, set $p_2 = p_3 = p_4 = 0$, so $p_5 = 1 - 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.7$. Thus, maximum probability $p = 2 \\\\times 0.7 \\\\times 0.1 = 0.14$.\\n\\nCompute $\\\\lfloor (k + 93)p \\\\rfloor = \\\\lfloor (11 + 93) \\\\times 0.14 \\\\rfloor = \\\\lfloor 104 \\\\times 0.14 \\\\rfloor = \\\\lfloor 14.56 \\\\rfloor = 14$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"14\"\n}",
