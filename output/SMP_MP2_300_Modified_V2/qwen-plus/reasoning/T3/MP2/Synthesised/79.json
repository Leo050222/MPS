  "math_problem": "Let $a, b$ be positive reals with $a>b>\\frac{1}{2} a$. Place two squares of side lengths $a, b$ next to each other, such that the larger square has lower left corner at $(0,0)$ and the smaller square has lower left corner at $(a, 0)$. Draw the line passing through $(0, a)$ and $(a+b, 0)$. The region in the two squares lying above the line has area 2013. If $(a, b)$ is the unique pair maximizing $a+b$, compute $\\frac{a}{b}$. Instead of computing $\\frac{a}{b}$ for the unique pair maximizing $a + b$, simply find $\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is the value of $\\frac{(a + b)^2}{a^2 - a b + 2 b^2}$ for that pair. Find the real solution(s) to the equation $(x+y)^{\\lambda - 2/7}=(x+1)(y-1)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the area above the line through (0, a) and (a+b, 0) within the two squares. The line equation is $ y = -\\\\frac{a}{a+b}x + a $. For the first square (0 ≤ x ≤ a), the area above the line is $ \\\\frac{a^3}{2(a+b)} $. For the second square (a ≤ x ≤ a+b), the area above the line is $ \\\\frac{b^2(a + 2b)}{2(a+b)} $. Summing these gives total area $ \\\\frac{a^2 - ab + 2b^2}{2} = 2013 $, so $ a^2 - ab + 2b^2 = 4026 $.\\n\\nTo maximize $ a + b $, let $ t = \\\\frac{a}{b} $ (with $ 1 < t < 2 $). Substitute $ a = tb $ into the constraint: $ b^2(t^2 - t + 2) = 4026 $. Then $ (a + b)^2 = b^2(t + 1)^2 = \\\\frac{4026(t + 1)^2}{t^2 - t + 2} $. Maximizing $ a + b $ is equivalent to maximizing $ \\\\frac{(t + 1)^2}{t^2 - t + 2} $. Taking the derivative and solving shows the maximum occurs at $ t = \\\\frac{5}{3} $, giving $ \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{(a + b)^2}{a^2 - ab + 2b^2} = \\\\frac{16}{7} $.\\n\\nNext, solve $ (x + y)^{\\\\lambda - 2/7} = (x + 1)(y - 1) $. Since $ \\\\lambda - \\\\frac{2}{7} = 2 $, the equation becomes $ (x + y)^2 = (x + 1)(y - 1) $. Expanding and simplifying yields $ x^2 + xy + y^2 + x - y + 1 = 0 $. Analyzing the discriminant shows the only real solution is $ x = -1 $, $ y = 1 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(-1, 1)\"\n}",
