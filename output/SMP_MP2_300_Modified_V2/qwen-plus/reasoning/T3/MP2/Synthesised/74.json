  "math_problem": "Let \\(P(x)\\) be a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients. Suppose that \\(P(1)=20, P(-1)=22\\), and \\(P(P(0))=400\\). Compute the largest possible value of \\(P(10)\\). Instead of finding the maximum possible evaluation of the quadratic at a designated point, simply find \\(k = b + 3\\), where \\(b\\) is the linear coefficient of the polynomial as determined by the given evaluation conditions. If $x, y$, and $z$ are real numbers such that $2 x^{k}+y^{k}+z^{2}=2 x-4 y+2 x z-5$, find the maximum possible value of $x-y+z$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Let $P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ be the quadratic polynomial. From $P(1) = 20$ and $P(-1) = 22$, we derive:\\n- $a + b + c = 20$\\n- $a - b + c = 22$\\n\\nSubtracting these equations gives $2b = -2 \\\\implies b = -1$. Adding them gives $2a + 2c = 42 \\\\implies a + c = 21$, so $c = 21 - a$.\\n\\nGiven $P(P(0)) = 400$, and $P(0) = c$, we have $P(c) = ac^2 + bc + c = ac^2$ (since $b = -1$). Thus, $ac^2 = 400$. Substituting $c = 21 - a$:\\n$$\\na(21 - a)^2 = 400\\n$$\\nSolving this cubic equation yields $a = 1, 16, 25$, but $b = -1$ is fixed. Therefore, $k = b + 3 = -1 + 3 = 2$.\\n\\nFor the second part, with $k = 2$, the equation becomes:\\n$$\\n2x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2x - 4y + 2xz - 5\\n$$\\nRearranging and completing the square:\\n$$\\n2\\\\left(x - \\\\frac{1 + z}{2}\\\\right)^2 + (y + 2)^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2}(z - 1)^2 = 0\\n$$\\nThis implies $x = 1$, $y = -2$, $z = 1$. Thus, $x - y + z = 1 - (-2) + 1 = 4$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4\"\n}",
