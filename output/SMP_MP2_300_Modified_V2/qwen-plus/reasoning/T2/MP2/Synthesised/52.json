  "math_problem": "Suppose that $x, y$, and $z$ are non-negative real numbers such that $x+y+z=1$. What is the maximum possible value of $x+y^{2}+z^{3}$ ? Instead of finding the maximum possible value of $x + y^2 + z^3$, simply find $k = z + 1/2$, where $z$ is the value of the variable with the cubic term in the non-negative real numbers $x, y, z$ satisfying $x + y + z = 1$ that achieve this maximum. Indecisive Andy starts out at the midpoint of the 1-unit-long segment $\\overline{H T}$. He flips $(k + 4019/2)$ coins. On each flip, if the coin is heads, he moves halfway towards endpoint $H$, and if the coin is tails, he moves halfway towards endpoint $T$. After his $(k + 4019/2)$ moves, what is the expected distance between Andy and the point on $\\overline{H T}$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the optimization part: maximizing $ x + y^2 + z^3 $ under the constraint $ x + y + z = 1 $ with $ x, y, z \\\\geq 0 $. \\n\\n### Step 1: Reformulate the Objective\\nGiven $ x + y + z = 1 $, we can express $ x = 1 - y - z $. Substituting into the objective function:\\n$$\\nx + y^2 + z^3 = (1 - y - z) + y^2 + z^3 = 1 - y - z + y^2 + z^3.\\n$$\\nThis simplifies to:\\n$$\\nf(y, z) = y^2 - y + z^3 - z + 1.\\n$$\\nWe aim to maximize this expression over the domain $ y, z \\\\geq 0 $ and $ y + z \\\\leq 1 $.\\n\\n### Step 2: Analyze Critical Points and Boundaries\\n- **Interior critical points** (where $ x > 0 $): Setting partial derivatives to zero gives $ y = \\\\frac{1}{2} $, $ z = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} $, but this leads to $ x < 0 $, which is invalid.\\n- **Boundary analysis**:\\n  - When $ x = 0 $, $ y + z = 1 $, so $ f = (1 - z)^2 + z^3 $, which has a maximum of 1 at $ z = 0 $ or $ z = 1 $.\\n  - When $ y = 0 $, $ x + z = 1 $, so $ f = 1 - z + z^3 $, which also achieves a maximum of 1 at $ z = 0 $ or $ z = 1 $.\\n  - When $ z = 0 $, $ x + y = 1 $, so $ f = 1 - y + y^2 $, which again achieves a maximum of 1 at $ y = 0 $ or $ y = 1 $.\\n\\nThus, the maximum value of $ x + y^2 + z^3 $ is **1**, achieved at three points:\\n- $ (x, y, z) = (1, 0, 0) $ → $ z = 0 $\\n- $ (x, y, z) = (0, 1, 0) $ → $ z = 0 $\\n- $ (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 1) $ → $ z = 1 $\\n\\nSince the question asks for \\\"the value of the variable with the cubic term\\\" that achieves the maximum, and the cubic term is $ z^3 $, the relevant value is $ z = 1 $ (as it's the only point where the cubic term contributes directly to the maximum).\\n\\n### Step 3: Compute $ k = z + \\\\frac{1}{2} $\\nWith $ z = 1 $, we get:\\n$$\\nk = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3}{2}.\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 4: Determine Number of Coin Flips\\nThe number of coin flips is:\\n$$\\nk + \\\\frac{4019}{2} = \\\\frac{3}{2} + \\\\frac{4019}{2} = \\\\frac{4022}{2} = 2011.\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 5: Expected Distance After Moves\\nAndy starts at the midpoint of segment $ \\\\overline{HT} $, which is at position $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $. Each move:\\n- Heads: move halfway toward $ H $ (position 0)\\n- Tails: move halfway toward $ T $ (position 1)\\n\\nLet $ D_n $ be the distance from the midpoint after $ n $ moves. It can be shown through recurrence relations and symmetry that for any $ n \\\\geq 1 $, the expected absolute distance from the midpoint is always:\\n$$\\n\\\\mathbb{E}[|D_n|] = \\\\frac{1}{4}.\\n$$\\nThis result holds regardless of the specific number of moves as long as $ n \\\\geq 1 $, which is satisfied here since $ n = 2011 $.\\n\\n### Final Answer\\nThe expected distance between Andy and the midpoint of $ \\\\overline{HT} $ after 2011 moves is $ \\\\frac{1}{4} $.\", \"answer\": \"1/4\"}",
