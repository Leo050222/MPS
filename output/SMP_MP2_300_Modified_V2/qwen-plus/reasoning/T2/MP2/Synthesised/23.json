  "math_problem": "Find all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of positive integers such that $2 a+1$ divides $3 b-1$ and $2 b+1$ divides $3 a-1$. Instead of determining all such ordered pairs, simply find $k = b - 14$, where $(a, b)$ is the ordered pair satisfying the divisibility conditions in which the second component exceeds the first. Meghana writes two (not necessarily distinct) primes $q$ and $r$ in base $(k + 7)$ next to each other on a blackboard, resulting in the concatenation of $q$ and $r$ (for example, if $q=(k + 10)$ and $r=(k + 2)$, the number on the blackboard is now $(k + 132)$). She notices that $k$ more than the resulting number is the square of a prime $p$. Find all possible values of $p$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the divisibility conditions: 2a + 1 divides 3b - 1 and 2b + 1 divides 3a - 1. Let m = 2a + 1 and n = 2b + 1, leading to equations 3n - 5 = 2mt and 3m - 5 = 2ns. Testing small positive integers for s and t (since 4st < 9), valid pairs (s, t) are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). This yields ordered pairs (a, b): (2,2), (12,17), (17,12). The pair with b > a is (12,17), so b = 17. Thus, k = b - 14 = 3.\\n\\nNext, base = k + 7 = 10. Meghana concatenates primes q and r in base 10, forming N = 10q + r (for single-digit r) or similar. The condition N + k = p² implies N = p² - 3. Checking primes p:\\n- p = 5: p² - 3 = 22 = 10*2 + 2 (q=2, r=2, both primes).\\n- Other primes (p=2,3,7,11,...) yield N values that cannot be split into two primes. Thus, only p=5 works.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
