  "math_problem": "If you roll four fair 6-sided dice, what is the probability that at least three of them will show the same value? Instead of computing the probability that at least three dice show the same value among four rolls, simply find $g = \\binom{4}{3} - 3$, where $\\binom{4}{3}$ is the number of ways to choose which three dice match in the exactly three matching case derived from the event decomposition. The classrooms at MIT are each identified with a positive integer (with no leading zeroes). One day, as President Reif walks down the Infinite Corridor, he notices that a digit zero on a room sign has fallen off. Let $N$ be the original number of the room, and let $M$ be the room number as shown on the sign. The smallest interval containing all possible values of $\\frac{M}{N}$ can be expressed as $\\left[\\frac{a}{b}, \\frac{c}{d}\\right)$ where $a, b, c, d$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=\\operatorname{gcd}(c, d)=g$. Compute $(g + 999) a+(g + 99) b+(g + 9) c+d$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute $ g = \\\\binom{4}{3} - 3 $. Since $ \\\\binom{4}{3} = 4 $, we have $ g = 4 - 3 = 1 $. Next, analyze the room number problem. When a zero falls off from $ N $, forming $ M $, the smallest value of $ \\\\frac{M}{N} $ is $ \\\\frac{1}{10} $ (achieved when the zero is at the end of $ N $, e.g., $ N = 10 $, $ M = 1 $). The largest possible values approach $ \\\\frac{2}{11} $ from below (e.g., $ N = 1099\\\\ldots9 $, $ M = 199\\\\ldots9 $), but never reach $ \\\\frac{2}{11} $. Thus, the interval is $ \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1}{10}, \\\\frac{2}{11} \\\\right) $. Here, $ a = 1 $, $ b = 10 $, $ c = 2 $, $ d = 11 $, and $ \\\\gcd(1, 10) = \\\\gcd(2, 11) = 1 = g $. Compute $ (g + 999)a + (g + 99)b + (g + 9)c + d $: $ (1 + 999) \\\\cdot 1 + (1 + 99) \\\\cdot 10 + (1 + 9) \\\\cdot 2 + 11 = 1000 + 1000 + 20 + 11 = 2031 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2031\"\n}",
