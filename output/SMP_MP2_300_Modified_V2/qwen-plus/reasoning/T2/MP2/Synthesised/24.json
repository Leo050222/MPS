  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be the answer to this problem. Box $B$ initially contains $n$ balls, and Box $A$ contains half as many balls as Box $B$. After 80 balls are moved from Box $A$ to Box $B$, the ratio of balls in Box $A$ to Box $B$ is now $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1$. Find $100p+q$. Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio. Let $T$ be a trapezoid with two right angles and side lengths $4,4,5$, and $\\sqrt{17}$. Two line segments are drawn, connecting the midpoints of opposite sides of $T$ and dividing $T$ into $k$ regions. If the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest of these regions is $d$, compute $(k + 236) d$.",

After moving 80 balls, Box $ A $ has $ n/2 - 80 $, Box $ B $ has $ n + 80 $. The ratio $ \\\\frac{n/2 - 80}{n + 80} $ simplifies to $ \\\\frac{p}{q} $ with $ \\\\gcd(p, q) = 1 $, so $ g = 1 $.

Midpoints of opposite sides are connected: horizontal line $ y = 2 $ (midpoints of legs) and line from $ (2.5, 0) $ to $ (2, 4) $ (midpoints of bases). These intersect at $ (2.25, 2) $, dividing $ T $ into 4 regions.\\n\\nCalculate areas:\\n- Regions 1 and 2 (below $ y = 2 $): each $ 19/4 = 4.75 $\\n- Regions 3 and 4 (above $ y = 2 $): each $ 17/4 = 4.25 $\\n\\nDifference $ d = 4.75 - 4.25 = 0.5 $.
