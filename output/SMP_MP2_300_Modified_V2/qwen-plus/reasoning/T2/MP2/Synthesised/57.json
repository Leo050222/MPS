  "math_problem": "Find the number of triangulations of a general convex 7-gon into 5 triangles by 4 diagonals that do not intersect in their interiors. Instead of determining the cardinality of the set of non-crossing triangulations of the given convex polygon, simply find $k = N - 41$, where $N$ is that cardinality derived from the standard combinatorial analysis of convex polygon triangulations. Let $P$ be a point selected uniformly at random in the cube $[0,1]^{3}$. The plane parallel to $x+y+z=0$ passing through $P$ intersects the cube in a two-dimensional region $\\mathcal{R}$. Let $t$ be the expected value of the perimeter of $\\mathcal{R}$. If $t^{2}$ can be written as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)=k$, compute $(k + 99) a+b$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The number of triangulations of a convex 7-gon is given by the 5th Catalan number, which is 42. Thus, $ k = N - 41 = 42 - 41 = 1 $. For the cube problem, the expected perimeter $ t $ of the plane section is calculated by integrating over the sum $ s = x + y + z $ of a random point in $[0,1]^3$. The perimeter depends on $ s $: for $ 0 \\\\leq s \\\\leq 1 $ and $ 2 \\\\leq s \\\\leq 3 $, it is $ 3s\\\\sqrt{2} $ and $ 3(3-s)\\\\sqrt{2} $ respectively; for $ 1 \\\\leq s \\\\leq 2 $, it is constant $ 3\\\\sqrt{2} $. Using the probability density function of $ s $, the expected value $ t $ is found to be $ \\\\frac{11}{4}\\\\sqrt{2} $, so $ t^2 = \\\\frac{121}{8} $. Here, $ a = 121 $, $ b = 8 $, and $ \\\\gcd(121, 8) = 1 = k $. Thus, $ (k + 99)a + b = (1 + 99) \\\\cdot 121 + 8 = 12108 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"12108\"\n}",
