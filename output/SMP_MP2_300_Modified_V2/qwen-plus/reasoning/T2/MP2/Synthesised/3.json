  "math_problem": "How many ways can you mark 8 squares of an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard so that no two marked squares are in the same row or column, and none of the four corner squares is marked? (Rotations and reflections are considered different.) Instead of counting the total number of valid placements satisfying the row, column, and corner avoidance conditions, simply find $s = m - 4$, where $m$ is the number of columns available for the intermediate rows after assigning columns to the boundary rows under the given constraints. Sally the snail sits on the $3 \\times 24$ lattice of points $(i, j)$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq 3$ and $1 \\leq j \\leq 24$. She wants to visit every point in the lattice exactly once. In a move, Sally can move to a point in the lattice exactly one unit away. Given that Sally starts at $(s,(s - 1))$, compute the number of possible paths Sally can take.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve for s in the chessboard problem. The chessboard is 8x8, and we need to avoid marking the four corners. Boundary rows (1 and 8) cannot use columns 1 or 8 (corners), so they choose from columns 2-7 (6 columns). Assigning two distinct columns to boundary rows leaves 8 - 2 = 6 columns available for intermediate rows (2-7). Thus, m = 6, so s = m - 4 = 2.\\n\\nNext, Sally starts at (s, s-1) = (2, 1) on a 3x24 lattice. For a 3xN grid, Hamiltonian paths starting at the middle of the first column are constrained to two possible snake-like paths: one starting upward and the other downward. Any deviation leads to unvisited nodes or backtracking. For N ≥ 2 (here N=24), only two valid paths exist. Hence, the number of paths is 2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2\"\n}",
