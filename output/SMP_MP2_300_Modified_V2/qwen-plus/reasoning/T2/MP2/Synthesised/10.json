  "math_problem": "You are given a $10 \\times 2$ grid of unit squares. Two different squares are adjacent if they share a side. How many ways can one mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent? Instead of counting the total number of ways to mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent, simply find $w$, where $w$ is the number of ways to mark one square in each of nine consecutive rows such that no two marked squares in adjacent rows share the same column. Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are positive integers with $m<n$ such that the interval $[m, n)$ contains more multiples of $(w + 2019)$ than multiples of $(w + 1998)$. Compute the maximum possible value of $n-m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by interpreting the definition of $ w $. The problem states:\\n\\n> \\\"Suppose that $ m $ and $ n $ are positive integers with $ m < n $ such that the interval $[m, n)$ contains more multiples of $(w + 2019)$ than multiples of $(w + 1998)$. Compute the maximum possible value of $ n - m $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine $ w $\\n\\nWe are told to compute $ w $, defined as:\\n\\n> \\\"the number of ways to mark one square in each of nine consecutive rows such that no two marked squares in adjacent rows share the same column.\\\"\\n\\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of sequences of length 9 where each element is either 'L' or 'R', and no two consecutive elements are the same.\\n\\n- For the first row, there are 2 choices (L or R).\\n- For each subsequent row, only 1 choice is valid (the opposite of the previous).\\n\\nThus, the total number of such sequences is:\\n$$\\nw = 2\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Define the Multiples\\n\\nGiven $ w = 2 $, we compute:\\n- $ A = w + 2019 = 2021 $\\n- $ B = w + 1998 = 2000 $\\n\\nWe now seek the **maximum** value of $ n - m $ such that the interval $[m, n)$ contains **more** multiples of $ A = 2021 $ than of $ B = 2000 $.\\n\\nLet:\\n- $ f_A = \\\\text{number of multiples of } A \\\\text{ in } [m, n) $\\n- $ f_B = \\\\text{number of multiples of } B \\\\text{ in } [m, n) $\\n\\nWe want:\\n$$\\nf_A > f_B\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Strategy for Maximizing $ n - m $\\n\\nThe key idea is to find the **longest interval** where the count of multiples of $ A $ exceeds that of $ B $. Since $ A > B $, the density of multiples of $ B $ is higher, so this can only happen in specific intervals.\\n\\nLet’s consider an interval starting just after a multiple of $ B $, i.e., $ m = B \\\\cdot s + 1 $, and ending just before the next multiple of $ B $ after $ k $ steps, i.e., $ n = B \\\\cdot (s + k) $.\\n\\nThen:\\n- Length of interval: $ L = n - m = B \\\\cdot k - 1 $\\n- Number of multiples of $ B $: $ k - 1 $\\n- Number of multiples of $ A $: $ k $, if the $ k $-th multiple of $ A $ lies within the interval\\n\\nSo we require:\\n$$\\nA \\\\cdot (t + k - 1) < B \\\\cdot (s + k)\\n$$\\nfor some integer $ t $, which simplifies to:\\n$$\\nd < A - k(A - B)\\n$$\\nwhere $ d = A \\\\cdot t - B \\\\cdot s $, and $ 1 \\\\leq d < A $\\n\\nSubstituting $ A = 2021 $, $ B = 2000 $, $ A - B = 21 $, we get:\\n$$\\nd < 2021 - 21k\\n$$\\nSince $ d \\\\geq 1 $, we must have:\\n$$\\n2021 - 21k > 1 \\\\Rightarrow k < \\\\frac{2020}{21} \\\\approx 96.19\\n$$\\nSo the **maximum integer** $ k $ satisfying this is:\\n$$\\nk = 96\\n$$\\n\\nFor $ k = 96 $, we have:\\n$$\\nd < 2021 - 21 \\\\cdot 96 = 2021 - 2016 = 5 \\\\Rightarrow d = 1, 2, 3, 4\\n$$\\n\\nThus, it's possible to construct an interval of length:\\n$$\\nL = B \\\\cdot k - 1 = 2000 \\\\cdot 96 - 1 = 192000 - 1 = 191999\\n$$\\nthat contains exactly 96 multiples of $ A $ and 95 multiples of $ B $, satisfying $ f_A > f_B $.\\n\\nAny longer interval would include the next multiple of $ B $, making $ f_B = 96 $, and thus $ f_A = f_B $, violating the condition.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Final Answer\\n\\nThe **maximum possible value** of $ n - m $ is:\\n$$\\n191999\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"191999\"}",
