  "math_problem": "A jar contains 8 red balls and 2 blue balls. Every minute, a ball is randomly removed. The probability that there exists a time during this process where there are more blue balls than red balls in the jar can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime integers $a$ and $b$. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing 100 times the numerator plus the denominator of the probability expressed in lowest terms, simply find $n$ equal to the greatest common divisor of that numerator and denominator plus 2004. The L shape made by adjoining three congruent squares can be subdivided into four smaller L shapes. Each of these can in turn be subdivided, and so forth. If we perform $n$ successive subdivisions, how many of the $4^{n}$ L's left at the end will be in the same orientation as the original one?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves multiple steps. First, we calculate the probability that during the removal of balls from a jar (8 red, 2 blue), there exists a time when blue balls exceed red balls. Using combinatorial analysis and the reflection principle, we find there are 10 such sequences out of 45 total, giving a probability of 10/45 = 2/9. Since 2 and 9 are coprime, gcd(2,9)=1, so n = 1 + 2004 = 2005.\\n\\nNext, we analyze the L-shape subdivision. Each subdivision of an L-shape into 4 smaller L-shapes results in the number of same-orientation L-shapes following the recurrence: after n subdivisions, the count is 4^{n-1}. For n=2005, this is 4^{2004}.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4^2004\"\n}",
