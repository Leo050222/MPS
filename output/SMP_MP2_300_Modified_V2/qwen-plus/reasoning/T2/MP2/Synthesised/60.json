  "math_problem": "After walking so much that his feet get really tired, the beaver staggers so that, at each step, his coordinates change by either (+1,+1) or (+1,-1). Now he walks from (0,0) to (8,0) without ever going below the x-axis. How many such paths are there? Instead of counting the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,0) that never go below the x-axis, simply find $k = m - 49$, where $m$ is the number of lattice paths from (0,-2) to (8,0) using steps of (+1,+1) or (+1,-1) derived from the reflection principle to count paths that violate the non-negativity condition. How many multiples of $k$ between $(k + 3)^{6}$ and $(k + 3)^{9}$ are perfect squares?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ m $, the number of lattice paths from $ (0, -2) $ to $ (8, 0) $ using steps $ (+1, +1) $ or $ (+1, -1) $. Each path consists of 8 steps. Let $ u $ be up steps and $ d $ be down steps. Then $ u + d = 8 $ and $ u - d = 2 $ (net $ y $-change from $ -2 $ to $ 0 $). Solving gives $ u = 5 $, $ d = 3 $. The number of such paths is $ \\\\binom{8}{5} = 56 $, so $ m = 56 $. Thus, $ k = m - 49 = 56 - 49 = 7 $.\\n\\nNext, find multiples of $ k = 7 $ between $ (k + 3)^6 = 10^6 $ and $ (k + 3)^9 = 10^9 $ that are perfect squares. A multiple of 7 that is a perfect square must be $ (7t)^2 = 49t^2 $ for integer $ t $. Solve $ 10^6 \\\\leq 49t^2 \\\\leq 10^9 $:\\n- Lower bound: $ t \\\\geq \\\\lceil \\\\sqrt{10^6 / 49} \\\\rceil = \\\\lceil 1000 / 7 \\\\rceil = 143 $\\n- Upper bound: $ t \\\\leq \\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt{10^9 / 49} \\\\rfloor = \\\\lfloor 10^{4.5} / 7 \\\\rfloor = \\\\lfloor 31622.7766 / 7 \\\\rfloor = 4517 $\\n\\nThe number of integers $ t $ from 143 to 4517 inclusive is $ 4517 - 143 + 1 = 4375 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4375\"\n}",
