  "math_problem": "Now a ball is launched from a vertex of an equilateral triangle with side length 5. It strikes the opposite side after traveling a distance of $\\sqrt{19}$. Find the distance from the ball's point of first contact with a wall to the nearest vertex. Instead of finding the distance from the point of first contact to the nearest vertex, simply find $k = d + 199/2$, where $d$ is the distance from the foot of the perpendicular from the launch vertex to the opposite side to the point of first contact. Eric is taking a biology class. His problem sets are worth 100 points in total, his three midterms are worth 100 points each, and his final is worth 300 points. If he gets a perfect score on his problem sets and scores $(k - 40) \\%$, $(k - 30) \\%$, and $(k - 20) \\%$ on his midterms respectively, what is the minimum possible percentage $p$ he can get on his final to ensure a passing grade? (Eric passes if and only if his overall percentage is at least $(k - 30) \\%)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, consider the equilateral triangle with side length 5. The height from the launch vertex (A) to the opposite side (BC) is $ \\\\frac{5\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} $. Let the foot of the perpendicular from A to BC be M (midpoint of BC). The ball travels $ \\\\sqrt{19} $ from A to point D on BC. Using coordinates: A at $ (2.5, \\\\frac{5\\\\sqrt{3}}{2}) $, M at $ (2.5, 0) $, and D at $ (x, 0) $. The distance AD gives $ (x - 2.5)^2 + \\\\left( \\\\frac{5\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\right)^2 = 19 $. Solving, $ (x - 2.5)^2 = 0.25 $, so $ x = 3 $ or $ 2 $, making $ d = |x - 2.5| = 0.5 $. Thus, $ k = d + \\\\frac{199}{2} = 0.5 + 99.5 = 100 $. \\n\\nFor Eric's grades: Problem sets (100 points, perfect score = 100). Midterms: $ (100 - 40)\\\\% = 60 $, $ (100 - 30)\\\\% = 70 $, $ (100 - 20)\\\\% = 80 $ (total 210). Final is 300 points. Total possible points = 700. To pass, overall percentage $ \\\\geq (100 - 30)\\\\% = 70\\\\% $. Total required points: $ 0.7 \\\\times 700 = 490 $. Points needed from final: $ 490 - (100 + 210) = 180 $. Minimum percentage on final: $ \\\\frac{180}{300} \\\\times 100 = 60 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"60\"\n}",
