  "math_problem": "Farmer John has 5 cows, 4 pigs, and 7 horses. Assume that all animals are distinguishable from each other. How many ways can he pair up the animals so that every pair consists of animals of different species? Instead of determining the total number of ways to pair up all the animals into mixed-species pairs, simply find $k = x + 2$, where $x$ is the number of cow-pig pairs in any such complete pairing. Compute the number of ways to color $k$ cells in a $k \\times k$ grid so that no two colored cells share an edge.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the number of cow-pig pairs (x) in any valid pairing. Farmer John has 5 cows (C), 4 pigs (P), and 7 horses (H). Let x = cow-pig pairs, y = cow-horse pairs, z = pig-horse pairs. The equations are: x + y = 5 (cows), x + z = 4 (pigs), y + z = 7 (horses). Solving gives x = 1, so k = x + 2 = 3. Next, compute the number of ways to color 3 cells in a 3×3 grid with no two adjacent. Valid configurations include 6 permutation matrices (one per row/column) and 14 non-permutation configurations (e.g., two in a row/column with a third non-adjacent cell). Total valid configurations: 20.\",\n    \"answer\": \"20\"\n}",
