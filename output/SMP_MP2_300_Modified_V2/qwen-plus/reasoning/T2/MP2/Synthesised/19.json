  "math_problem": "Suppose $a$ and $b$ be positive integers not exceeding 100 such that $$a b=\\left(\\frac{\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)}{\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)}\\right)^{2}$$ Compute the largest possible value of $a+b$. Instead of computing the maximum possible sum of two positive integers not exceeding 100 that satisfy the given equation relating their product to the square of the ratio of their least common multiple to their greatest common divisor, simply find $m = s - 77$, where $s$ is that maximum possible sum. Consider a $(m + 4) \\times (m + 4)$ grid of squares. Vladimir colors some of these squares red, such that the centers of any four red squares do not form an axis-parallel rectangle (i.e. a rectangle whose sides are parallel to those of the squares). What is the maximum number of squares he could have colored red?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"First, solve the equation $ ab = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)}{\\\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)} \\\\right)^2 $ for positive integers $ a, b \\\\leq 100 $. Let $ d = \\\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b) $, so $ a = dx $, $ b = dy $ with $ \\\\operatorname{gcd}(x, y) = 1 $. Then $ \\\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = dxy $, and the equation becomes:\\n$$\\nd^2xy = (xy)^2 \\\\implies d^2 = xy.\\n$$\\nSince $ \\\\operatorname{gcd}(x, y) = 1 $, $ x $ and $ y $ must be perfect squares. Let $ x = m^2 $, $ y = n^2 $ with $ \\\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n) = 1 $, so $ d = mn $. Thus, $ a = m^3n $, $ b = mn^3 $.\\n\\nCheck all valid $ (m, n) $ pairs where $ a, b \\\\leq 100 $:\\n- $ (m, n) = (1, 4) $: $ a = 4, b = 64 $ (sum 68)\\n- $ (m, n) = (2, 3) $: $ a = 24, b = 54 $ (sum 78)\\n- Other pairs yield smaller sums.\\n\\nThe maximum sum $ s = 78 $. Compute $ m = s - 77 = 1 $. The grid size is $ (m + 4) \\\\times (m + 4) = 5 \\\\times 5 $.\\n\\nFor a $ 5 \\\\times 5 $ grid, the maximum number of red squares without axis-parallel rectangles is determined by the Zarankiewicz problem $ z(5, 5; 2, 2) $. Known value: 12. This is achievable by arranging red squares such that no two rows share two columns, satisfying the rectangle-free condition.\", \"answer\": \"12\"}",
