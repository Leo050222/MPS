  "math_problem": "Consider 8-digit numbers, where the first digit is from 1 to 9, the other digits are from 0 to 9, and exactly four of the digits are 9. Count how many such numbers there are. Instead of counting the total number of such 8-digit numbers, simply find $k = \\binom{8}{4} - 67$, where $\\binom{8}{4}$ is the number of ways to choose the four positions for the 9's. $r$ and $s$ are integers such that $3 r \\geq 2 s - k$ and $4 s \\geq r + (k + 9)$. What is the smallest possible value of $r / s$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, calculate $ k = \\\\binom{8}{4} - 67 $. $ \\\\binom{8}{4} = 70 $, so $ k = 70 - 67 = 3 $. The inequalities become $ 3r \\\\geq 2s - 3 $ and $ 4s \\\\geq r + 12 $. Rearranging, $ r \\\\geq \\\\frac{2s - 3}{3} $ and $ r \\\\leq 4s - 12 $. For integer $ s \\\\geq 4 $, the smallest valid $ s $ is 4. When $ s = 4 $, $ r \\\\geq \\\\frac{5}{3} \\\\approx 1.67 $ (so $ r \\\\geq 2 $) and $ r \\\\leq 4 $. Testing $ r = 2 $, $ s = 4 $: $ 3(2) = 6 \\\\geq 5 $ and $ 4(4) = 16 \\\\geq 14 $, both true. The ratio $ r/s = 2/4 = 1/2 $. Checking other $ s $ values (e.g., $ s = 6, r = 3 $) also gives $ 1/2 $, but no smaller ratio exists as lower $ s $ values fail the inequalities. Negative $ s $ or $ r $ yield invalid solutions. Thus, the smallest $ r/s $ is $ 1/2 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/2\"\n}",
