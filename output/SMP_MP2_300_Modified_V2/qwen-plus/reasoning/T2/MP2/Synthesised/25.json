  "math_problem": "Nine fair coins are flipped independently and placed in the cells of a 3 by 3 square grid. Let $p$ be the probability that no row has all its coins showing heads and no column has all its coins showing tails. If $p=\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator of the desired probability in lowest terms, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the sum of the probability that a specific row does not have all heads and the probability that a specific row has all heads. Circle $\\omega_{1}$ of radius $k$ and circle $\\omega_{2}$ of radius $(k + 1)$ are concentric. Godzilla inscribes square $C A S H$ in $\\omega_{1}$ and regular pentagon $M O N E Y$ in $\\omega_{2}$. It then writes down all $(k + 19)$ (not necessarily distinct) distances between a vertex of $C A S H$ and a vertex of $M O N E Y$ and multiplies them all together. What is the maximum possible value of his result?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding the maximum product of all distances between vertices of a square inscribed in a circle of radius $ k $ and a regular pentagon inscribed in a concentric circle of radius $ k + 1 $. First, we determine $ k $: it is the sum of the probability that a specific row does not have all heads and the probability that it does. For a 3-coin row, the probability of all heads is $ \\\\frac{1}{8} $, so the probability of not all heads is $ \\\\frac{7}{8} $. Their sum is $ \\\\frac{1}{8} + \\\\frac{7}{8} = 1 $, so $ k = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, the circles have radii $ k = 1 $ and $ k + 1 = 2 $. The square (4 vertices) is inscribed in the unit circle, and the pentagon (5 vertices) in the circle of radius 2. The product of all 20 distances between vertices is invariant under rotation due to symmetry. Using complex analysis, the product of distances between all pairs of vertices of a regular $ m $-gon and $ n $-gon on concentric circles of radii $ r $ and $ R $ is $ |R^{mn} - r^{mn}| $ when $ \\\\gcd(m, n) = 1 $. Here, $ m = 4 $, $ n = 5 $, $ r = 1 $, $ R = 2 $, and $ \\\\gcd(4, 5) = 1 $, so the product is $ 2^{20} - 1 = 1048575 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1048575\"\n}",
