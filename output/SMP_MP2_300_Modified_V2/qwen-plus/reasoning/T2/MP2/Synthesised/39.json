  "math_problem": "The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to $k>0$, find $k$. Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition. A ladder is leaning against a house with its lower end $d$ feet from the house. When the lower end is pulled $(d - 6)$ feet farther from the house, the upper end slides $(d - 2)$ feet down. How long is the ladder (in feet)?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The rectangle has width $ w $ and length $ 3w $. Perimeter $ = 2(3w + w) = 8w $, area $ = 3w^2 $. Setting them equal: $ 8w = 3w^2 \\\\implies w = \\\\frac{8}{3} $ (since $ w > 0 $). Then $ d = w + \\\\frac{37}{3} = \\\\frac{8}{3} + \\\\frac{37}{3} = 15 $. For the ladder: initial base $ = 15 $ ft, new base $ = 15 + (15 - 6) = 24 $ ft, height decreases by $ 15 - 2 = 13 $ ft. Let original height be $ h $. Using Pythagoras: $ 15^2 + h^2 = 24^2 + (h - 13)^2 $. Solving gives $ h = 20 $, so ladder length $ = \\\\sqrt{15^2 + 20^2} = 25 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"25\"\n}",
