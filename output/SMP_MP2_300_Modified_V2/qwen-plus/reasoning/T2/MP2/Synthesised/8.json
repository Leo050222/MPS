  "math_problem": "Teresa the bunny has a fair 8-sided die. Seven of its sides have fixed labels $1,2, \\\\ldots, 7$, and the label on the eighth side can be changed and begins as 1. She rolls it several times, until each of $1,2, \\\\ldots, 7$ appears at least once. After each roll, if $k$ is the smallest positive integer that she has not rolled so far, she relabels the eighth side with $k$. The probability that 7 is the last number she rolls is $\\\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the specified linear combination from the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process, simply find $m = q_0 + 3999/4$, where $q_0$ is the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process derived from the recursive probability analysis of the states based on the number of distinct fixed labels collected. Let $N$ be the number of triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ satisfying $a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c, \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b, c)=1, \\\\quad a b c=6^{2020}$. Compute the remainder when $N$ is divided by $m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main components: determining the probability $ q_0 $ that 7 is the last number rolled by Teresa the bunny, and computing the number $ N $ of triples $(a, b, c)$ satisfying specific conditions, then finding $ N \\\\mod m $ where $ m = q_0 + \\\\frac{3999}{4} $.\\n\\n**Step 1: Compute $ q_0 $**  \\nTeresa's process is modeled as a coupon collector problem with a twist: the eighth side of the die is relabeled to the smallest missing label after each roll. The key insight is that the probability $ q_0 $ that 7 is the last label collected depends on the number of uncollected labels $ n $. For $ n $ uncollected labels (including 7), the recurrence relation for the probability $ p(n) $ that 7 is last is:\\n$$\\np(n) = \\\\frac{n}{n+1} \\\\cdot p(n-1)\\n$$\\nwith base case $ p(1) = 1 $. Solving this recurrence gives:\\n$$\\np(n) = \\\\frac{2}{n+1}\\n$$\\nFor $ n = 7 $ (initial state with all 7 labels uncollected), we find:\\n$$\\nq_0 = p(7) = \\\\frac{2}{8} = \\\\frac{1}{4}\\n$$\\n\\n**Step 2: Compute $ m $**  \\nGiven $ m = q_0 + \\\\frac{3999}{4} $:\\n$$\\nm = \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{3999}{4} = \\\\frac{4000}{4} = 1000\\n$$\\n\\n**Step 3: Compute $ N $**  \\nThe number $ N $ counts triples $(a, b, c)$ with $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c $, $ \\\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1 $, and $ abc = 6^{2020} $. Factorizing $ 6^{2020} = 2^{2020} \\\\cdot 3^{2020} $, we analyze exponents for primes 2 and 3 separately.\\n\\n- The condition $ \\\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1 $ requires $ \\\\min(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 0 $ and $ \\\\min(y_1, y_2, y_3) = 0 $ for exponents $ x_i, y_i $ of 2 and 3.\\n- Using inclusion-exclusion, the number of ordered triples with $ \\\\min(x_i) = 0 $ is $ 3 \\\\cdot 2020 = 6060 $ (similarly for $ y_i $).\\n- Total ordered triples with $ \\\\gcd = 1 $: $ T_0 = 6060^2 $.\\n- Number of ordered triples with $ a = b $ and $ \\\\gcd = 1 $: $ U_0 = 4 $ (derived from valid exponent combinations).\\n- The number of unordered triples $ N $ is:\\n$$\\nN = \\\\frac{T_0 + 3U_0}{6} = \\\\frac{6060^2 + 12}{6} = 6 \\\\cdot 1010^2 + 2 = 6120602\\n$$\\n\\n**Step 4: Compute $ N \\\\mod m $**  \\nSince $ m = 1000 $, we find the remainder of $ 6120602 $ modulo 1000:\\n$$\\n6120602 \\\\mod 1000 = 602\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"602\"}",
