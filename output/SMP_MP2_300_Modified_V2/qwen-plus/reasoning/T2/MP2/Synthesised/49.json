  "math_problem": "A candy company makes 5 colors of jellybeans, which come in equal proportions. If I grab a random sample of 5 jellybeans, what is the probability that I get exactly 2 distinct colors? Instead of determining the probability of obtaining exactly two distinct colors in the sample, simply find $k = \\binom{5}{2} + 80$, where $\\binom{5}{2}$ is the number of ways to choose the two distinct colors from the five available. Triangle $\\triangle A B C$ has $A B=(k - 69), B C=(k - 35)$, and $C A=(k - 34)$. There are two points $P$ in the plane of $\\triangle A B C$ for which $\\angle B A P=\\angle C A P$ and $\\angle B P C=k^{\\circ}$. Find the distance between them.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute $ k = \\\\binom{5}{2} + 80 $. Since $ \\\\binom{5}{2} = 10 $, we have $ k = 10 + 80 = 90 $. Next, determine the side lengths of $ \\\\triangle ABC $: $ AB = k - 69 = 21 $, $ BC = k - 35 = 55 $, and $ CA = k - 34 = 56 $. \\n\\nThe problem requires finding the distance between two points $ P $ such that $ \\\\angle BAP = \\\\angle CAP $ (i.e., $ P $ lies on the angle bisector of $ \\\\angle A $) and $ \\\\angle BPC = 90^\\\\circ $ (i.e., $ P $ lies on the circle with $ BC $ as diameter). \\n\\nPlace $ B $ at $ (0, 0) $, $ C $ at $ (55, 0) $, and compute coordinates of $ A $ using distances $ AB = 21 $ and $ AC = 56 $. Solving yields $ A = (3, 12\\\\sqrt{3}) $. The angle bisector of $ \\\\angle A $ passes through $ A $ and the point $ D $ on $ BC $ where $ BD/DC = AB/AC = 3/8 $, giving $ D = (15, 0) $. The equation of the angle bisector is $ y = -\\\\sqrt{3}x + 15\\\\sqrt{3} $. \\n\\nThe circle with $ BC $ as diameter has center $ (27.5, 0) $ and radius $ 27.5 $, with equation $ x^2 + y^2 - 55x = 0 $. Substituting the angle bisector into the circle equation yields a quadratic in $ x $: $ 4x^2 - 145x + 675 = 0 $. The discriminant is $ 10225 $, so the distance between the intersection points is $ \\\\sqrt{10225}/2 = 5\\\\sqrt{409}/2 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5\\\\sqrt{409}/2\"\n}",
