  "math_problem": "During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^{2}$. Instead of determining the real part of the square of the starting point, simply find $k = |z| - 1$, where $|z|$ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days. Bob's Rice ID number has six digits, each a number from 1 to 9, and any digit can be used any number of times. The ID number satisfies the following property: the first two digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo $(k + 2)$, the first three digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo $(k + 3)$, the first four digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo $(k + 4)$, the first five digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 5, and the ID number itself is congruent to $k$ modulo 6. One ID number that satisfies this condition is 123252. How many different possibilities are there for Bob's ID number?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, analyze the complex number problem. On Saturday, Eli travels from z to z^3, z^5, ..., z^2013, with 1006 segments. On Sunday, from 1 to z^2, z^4, ..., z^2012, also 1006 segments. The total distance traveled on both days is the sum of segment lengths. For Saturday, each segment length is |z^(2k+3) - z^(2k+1)| = |z|^(2k+1)|z^2 - 1|, summing to |z^2 - 1| * r * (r^2012 - 1)/(r^2 - 1) where r = |z|. For Sunday, it's |z^2 - 1| * (r^2012 - 1)/(r^2 - 1). Setting both distances equal (given as √2012), we get r * Sum_sun = Sum_sun, implying r = 1 (since Sum_sun ≠ 0). Thus, |z| = 1, so k = |z| - 1 = 0.\\n\\nNext, for Bob's ID number (6 digits, 1-9):\\n- k = 0, so conditions are:\\n  1. First two digits even (mod 2).\\n  2. First three digits sum to 0 mod 3.\\n  3.
