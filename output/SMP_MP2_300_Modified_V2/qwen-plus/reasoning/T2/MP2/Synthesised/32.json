  "math_problem": "On a blackboard a stranger writes the values of $s_{7}(n)^{2}$ for $n=0,1, \\ldots, 7^{20}-1$, where $s_{7}(n)$ denotes the sum of digits of $n$ in base 7 . Compute the average value of all the numbers on the board. Instead of computing the average of the squares of the digit sums, simply find $m = \\mathrm{Var}(S) - 65$, where $S$ is the sum of digits in base 7 of a uniformly random $n$ from $0$ to $7^{20}-1$. The number 3003 is the only number known to appear eight times in Pascal's triangle, at positions $\\binom{3003}{1},\\binom{3003}{3002},\\binom{a}{2},\\binom{a}{a-2},\\binom{m}{b},\\binom{m}{m-b},\\binom{14}{6},\\binom{14}{8}$. Compute $a+b(m-b)$.",

Since each digit in base 7 is independently and uniformly distributed over $ \\\\{0, 1, \\\\dots, 6\\\\} $, we can compute the variance of $ S $ as follows:\\n\\n- The expected value of a single digit $ d $ is $ \\\\mathbb{E}[d] = \\\\frac{0 + 1 + \\\\cdots + 6}{7} = 3 $.\\n- The second moment is $ \\\\mathbb{E}[d^2] = \\\\frac{0^2 + 1^2 + \\\\cdots + 6^2}{7} = \\\\frac{91}{7} = 13 $.\\n- Thus, the variance of a single digit is $ \\\\text{Var}(d) = \\\\mathbb{E}[d^2] - (\\\\mathbb{E}[d])^2 = 13 - 9 = 4 $.\\n- Since there are 20 independent digits (as $ n < 7^{20} $), the total variance is $ \\\\text{Var}(S) = 20 \\\\times 4 = 80 $.\\n\\nGiven $ m = \\\\text{Var}(S) - 65 $, we find $ m = 80 - 65 = 15 $.\\n\\nNext, we analyze the Pascal's triangle positions where 3003 appears. The problem states that 3003 appears at:\\n- $ \\\\binom{3003}{1}, \\\\binom{3003}{3002} $\\n- $ \\\\binom{a}{2}, \\\\binom{a}{a-2} $\\n- $ \\\\binom{m}{b}, \\\\binom{m}{m-b} $\\n- $ \\\\binom{14}{6}, \\\\binom{14}{8} $\\n\\nWe determine:\\n- $ \\\\binom{a}{2} = 3003 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{a(a-1)}{2} = 3003 \\\\Rightarrow a = 78 $\\n- $ \\\\binom{15}{b} = 3003 \\\\Rightarrow b = 5 $ (since $ \\\\binom{15}{5} = 3003 $)\\n\\nFinally, compute $ a + b(m - b) = 78 + 5(15 - 5) = 78 + 50 = 128 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"128\"\n}",
