  "math_problem": "Ava and Tiffany participate in a knockout tournament consisting of a total of 32 players. In each of 5 rounds, the remaining players are paired uniformly at random. In each pair, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is knocked out of the tournament. The probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other during the tournament is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of evaluating the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator representing the probability that the two designated players meet during the tournament, simply find $b$, the denominator of that probability when expressed as a reduced fraction. Let $p$ be a real number and $c \\neq 0$ an integer such that $c-0.1<x^{p}\\left(\\frac{1-(1+x)^{(b-6)}}{1+(1+x)^{(b-6)}}\\right)<c+0.1$ for all (positive) real numbers $x$ with $(b-16)<x<10^{-100}$. Find the ordered pair $(p, c)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the probability that Ava and Tiffany meet in a 32-player knockout tournament. In such tournaments with random pairings each round, the probability two specific players meet is 2/n where n is the number of players. For n=32, this probability is 2/32 = 1/16. Thus, the denominator b of the reduced fraction is 16.\\n\\nNext, analyze the expression for small x > 0 (since b-16 = 0, x is in (0, 10^-100)). With b=16, b-6=10, so the expression becomes x^p * [1 - (1+x)^10]/[1 + (1+x)^10]. For small x, (1+x)^10 ≈ 1 + 10x, so the numerator ≈ -10x and the denominator ≈ 2. The fraction simplifies to ≈ -5x. To make x^p * (-5x) approach a constant, set p+1=0 ⇒ p=-1. The constant is -5, so c=-5. The ordered pair is (-1, -5).\",\n    \"answer\": \"(-1, -5)\"\n}",
