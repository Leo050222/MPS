  "math_problem": "Compute all ordered triples $(x, y, z)$ of real numbers satisfying the following system of equations: $$\\begin{aligned} x y+z & =40 \\\\\\\\ x z+y & =51 \\\\\\\\ x+y+z & =19 \\end{aligned}$$ Instead of computing all ordered triples of real numbers satisfying the system of equations, simply find $k = z + \\frac{17}{5}$, where $z$ is the third component in the solution corresponding to the smaller root for $x + 1$ among the roots of the quadratic equation derived from the system. There are 21 competitors with distinct skill levels numbered $1,2, \\ldots, 21$. They participate in a pingpong tournament as follows. First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill $k$. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the system of equations:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\nxy + z &= 40 \\\\\\\\\\nxz + y &= 51 \\\\\\\\\\nx + y + z &= 19\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Step 1: Solve the System of Equations**\\n\\nFrom the third equation, express $ z = 19 - x - y $. Substitute into the first two equations:\\n\\n- From the first equation:\\n  $$\\n  xy + (19 - x - y) = 40 \\\\Rightarrow xy - x - y = 21 \\\\Rightarrow (x - 1)(y - 1) = 22\\n  $$\\n\\n- From the second equation:\\n  $$\\n  x(19 - x - y) + y = 51 \\\\Rightarrow 19x - x^2 - xy + y = 51\\n  $$\\n\\nSubstitute $ y = \\\\frac{x + 21}{x - 1} $ from the factorization above into this expression and simplify. After algebraic manipulation, we find that $ x $ satisfies the quadratic:\\n\\n$$\\nx^2 - 18x + 72 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nSolving this gives:\\n$$\\nx = 6 \\\\quad \\\\text{or} \\\\quad x = 12\\n$$\\n\\nFor each value of $ x $, compute corresponding $ y $ and $ z $:\\n\\n- If $ x = 6 $:\\n  $$\\ny = \\\\frac{6 + 21}{6 - 1} = \\\\frac{27}{5}, \\\\quad z = 19 - 6 - \\\\frac{27}{5} = \\\\frac{38}{5}\\n  $$\\n\\n- If $ x = 12 $:\\n  $$\\ny = \\\\frac{12 + 21}{12 - 1} = 3, \\\\quad z = 19 - 12 - 3 = 4\\n  $$\\n\\nSo the solutions are:\\n- $ (x, y, z) = (6, \\\\frac{27}{5}, \\\\frac{38}{5}) $\\n- $ (x, y, z) = (12, 3, 4) $\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Step 2: Determine $ k = z + \\\\frac{17}{5} $**\\n\\nWe are told to use the solution corresponding to the **smaller root for $ x + 1 $** among the roots of the quadratic.\\n\\n- For $ x = 6 $: $ x + 1 = 7 $\\n- For $ x = 12 $: $ x + 1 = 13 $\\n\\nThus, the smaller root is $ x = 6 $, so we take $ z = \\\\frac{38}{5} $.\\n\\nThen:\\n$$\\nk = z + \\\\frac{17}{5} = \\\\frac{38}{5} + \\\\frac{17}{5} = \\\\frac{55}{5} = 11\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Step 3: Expected Number of Games Alice Plays in the Tournament**\\n\\nAlice has skill level $ k = 11 $ in a tournament with 21 players numbered $ 1 $ through $ 21 $.\\n\\nThe tournament proceeds as follows:\\n- One player is randomly chosen as active.\\n- Each round, a random inactive player is selected to challenge the current active player.\\n- The higher-skilled player becomes (or remains) active; the loser is eliminated.\\n- This continues for 20 rounds until one player remains.\\n\\nWe are to compute the **expected number of games Alice plays**, given her skill level is 11.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Insight**\\n\\nAlthough the skill levels determine who wins, the **selection of who plays** is entirely random. That is, the process of choosing which inactive player challenges the current active player is uniformly random at each step.\\n\\nThis implies that the **expected number of games any player plays is the same**, regardless of their skill level.\\n\\nWhy? Because the selection of who plays is independent of skill — it's purely based on random choice. Skill only determines the outcome of the game, not whether the player participates.\\n\\nTherefore, the expected number of games played by **any** player is equal to the average number of games per player across all possible tournaments.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Step 4: Compute the Expected Number of Games Per Player**\\n\\nThere are 21 players and 20 games in total (since 20 players must be eliminated).\\n\\nEach game involves **two players**, so the total number of player-game participations is:\\n$$\\n2 \\\\times 20 = 40\\n$$\\n\\nHence, the expected number of games per player is:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{40}{21}\\n$$\\n\\nSince the selection process is symmetric and random, **every player has the same expected number of games**, including Alice.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Final Answer**\", \"answer\": \"40/21\"}",
