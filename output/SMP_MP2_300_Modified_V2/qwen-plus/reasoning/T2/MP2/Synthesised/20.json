  "math_problem": "Wendy eats sushi for lunch. She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, labeled as follows:\n\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} A & B & C \\\\ D & E & F \\\\ \\end{array}$\n\nwhere pieces are adjacent if they share a side (not counting diagonally), with adjacencies $A$-$B$, $A$-$D$, $B$-$C$, $B$-$E$, $C$-$F$, $D$-$E$, $E$-$F$. The pieces of sushi are distinguishable. She can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other remaining pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row. Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers randomly (and independently) chosen from the range $[(k - 1),k]$. Find the probability that $a$, $b$ and $k$ form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ k $. The grid has pieces labeled $ A, B, C $ (top row) and $ D, E, F $ (bottom row). The two endpoint pieces of the top row are $ A $ and $ C $. After eating $ A $ and $ C $, the remaining pieces are $ B, D, E, F $. The induced subgraph on these remaining pieces has edges: $ B-E $, $ D-E $, and $ E-F $. In this subgraph, $ F $ is only adjacent to $ E $, so $ \\\\deg(F) = 1 $. Thus, $ k = \\\\deg(F) + 0 = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, $ a $ and $ b $ are chosen uniformly from $ [0, 1] $ (since $ k = 1 $, the range is $ [k-1, k] = [0, 1] $). To form an obtuse triangle with side lengths $ a, b, k = 1 $:\\n- The triangle inequalities require $ a + b > 1 $ (as $ 1 $ is the longest side since $ a, b \\\\leq 1 $).\\n- For obtuseness, $ 1^2 > a^2 + b^2 $ (since $ 1 $ is the longest side).\\n\\nThe region where $ a + b > 1 $ and $ a^2 + b^2 < 1 $ within $ [0, 1] \\\\times [0, 1] $ is the area of the quarter-circle $ a^2 + b^2 < 1 $ minus the area of the triangle $ a + b \\\\leq 1 $. The quarter-circle area is $ \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} $, and the triangle area is $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $. Thus, the favorable area is $ \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi - 2}{4} $. The probability is this area divided by the sample space area (1), so the probability is $ \\\\frac{\\\\pi - 2}{4} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(\\\\pi - 2)/4\"\n}",
