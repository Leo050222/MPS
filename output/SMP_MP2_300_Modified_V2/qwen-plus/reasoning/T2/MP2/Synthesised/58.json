  "math_problem": "Let $A B C$ be an isosceles triangle with apex $A$. Let $I$ be the incenter. If $A I=3$ and the distance from $I$ to $B C$ is 2 , then what is the length of $B C$ ? Instead of determining the length of the base $BC$, simply find $d = AY - 4$, where $AY$ is the length of the segment from $A$ to $Y$ along the angle bisector, and $Y$ is the point of tangency of the incircle with $BC$. Find an $n$ such that $n! + (-d)(n-1)! + (-d)^2 (n-2)! + (-d)^3 (n-3)! + \\cdots + (-d)^{n-1} \\cdot 1!$ is prime. Be prepared to justify your answer for $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}n, \\\\\\\\ \\left[\\frac{n+225}{(d + 9)}\\right],\\\\ \\end{array} n \\leq (d + 24)\\right.$ points, where $[N]$ is the greatest integer less than $N$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves an isosceles triangle $ABC$ with apex $A$, incenter $I$, $AI = 3$, and the inradius $r = 2$ (distance from $I$ to $BC$). Since $I$ lies on the angle bisector (which is also the altitude in an isosceles triangle), the altitude $AY$ from $A$ to $BC$ equals $AI + r = 3 + 2 = 5$. Thus, $d = AY - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1$.\\n\\nNext, we evaluate the sum $S(n) = n! + (-d)(n-1)! + (-d)^2(n-2)! + \\\\cdots + (-d)^{n-1} \\\\cdot 1!$ for $d = 1$. This simplifies to $S(n) = n! - (n-1)! + (n-2)! - \\\\cdots + (-1)^{n-1} \\\\cdot 1!$.\\n\\n- For $n = 1$: $S(1) = 1! = 1$ (not prime).\\n- For $n = 2$: $S(2) = 2! - 1! = 1$ (not prime).\\n- For $n = 3$: $S(3) = 3! - 2! + 1! = 6 - 2 + 1 = 5$ (prime).\\n\\nSince $n = 3$ satisfies $n \\\\leq d + 24 = 25$ and $S(3)$ is prime, $n = 3$ is valid. The condition $\\\\left[\\\\frac{n + 225}{d + 9}\\\\right] = \\\\left[\\\\frac{3 + 225}{10}\\\\right] = 22$ is consistent with the problem's requirements.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
