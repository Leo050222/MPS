  "math_problem": "Define $\\varphi^{k}(n)$ as the number of positive integers that are less than or equal to $n / k$ and relatively prime to $n$. Find $\\phi^{2001}\\left(2002^{2}-1\\right)$. (Hint: $\\phi(2003)=2002$.) Instead of determining $\\varphi^k(n)$ as defined for the given argument and superscript, simply find $q = \\gcd(m, k) + k$, where $k$ is the superscript used in $\\varphi^k(n)$, and $m$ is the positive integer for which the argument of $\\varphi$ is $m^2 - 1$. The real function $f$ has the property that, whenever $a, b, n$ are positive integers such that $a+b=2^{n}$, the equation $f(a)+f(b)=n^{2}$ holds. What is $f(q)$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, identify m and k from the problem. The argument of φ is 2002² - 1, so m = 2002. The superscript k is 2001. Compute q = gcd(m, k) + k. Since gcd(2002, 2001) = 1 (consecutive integers), q = 1 + 2001 = 2002.\\n\\nNext, determine f(2002) given the function property: for a + b = 2ⁿ, f(a) + f(b) = n². To find f(2002), use the smallest n where 2ⁿ > 2002, which is n = 11 (2¹¹ = 2048). Thus, 2002 + 46 = 2048, so f(2002) + f(46) = 11² = 121.\\n\\nFor f(46), use n = 6 (2⁶ = 64): 46 + 18 = 64 ⇒ f(46) + f(18) = 6² = 36.\\nFor f(18), use n = 5 (2⁵ = 32): 18 + 14 = 32 ⇒ f(18) + f(14) = 5² = 25.\\nFor f(14), use n = 4 (2⁴ = 16): 14 + 2 = 16 ⇒ f(14) + f(2) = 4² = 16. Since f(2) = 2 (from 2 + 2 = 4 = 2² ⇒ 2f(2) = 4), f(14) = 14.\\n\\nBacktracking: f(18) = 25 - 14 = 11; f(46) = 36 - 11 = 25; f(2002) = 121 - 25 = 96.\",\n    \"answer\": \"96\"\n}",
