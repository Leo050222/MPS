  "math_problem": "The fraction $\\frac{1}{2015}$ has a unique \"(restricted) partial fraction decomposition\" of the form $\\frac{1}{2015}=\\frac{a}{5}+\\frac{b}{13}+\\frac{c}{31}$ where $a, b, c$ are integers with $0 \\leq a<5$ and $0 \\leq b<13$. Find $a+b$. Instead of finding the sum of the coefficients corresponding to the two smallest denominators, simply find $L = b + 2004$, where $b$ is the integer coefficient of the term with denominator $13$ in the restricted partial fraction decomposition. Katherine has a piece of string that is $L$ millimeters long. She cuts the string at a location chosen uniformly at random, and takes the left half. She continues this process until the remaining string is less than one millimeter long. What is the expected number of cuts that she makes?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, factorize 2015 = 5 × 13 × 31. The partial fraction decomposition requires solving 1 = 403a + 155b + 65c (since 1/2015 = a/5 + b/13 + c/31 implies 1 = a×13×31 + b×5×31 + c×5×13). \\n\\n- Modulo 5: 403 ≡ 3 mod 5, so 3a ≡ 1 mod 5 ⇒ a = 2 (since 3×2 = 6 ≡ 1 mod 5).\\n- Modulo 13: 155 ≡ -1 mod 13, so -b ≡ 1 mod 13 ⇒ b = 12 (since -12 ≡ 1 mod 13).\\n\\nThus, L = b + 2004 = 12 + 2004 = 2016.\\n\\nFor the expected number of cuts: Katherine starts with length L = 2016. Each cut reduces the length to a uniform random value in (0, current length). The process stops when the length is < 1. Let E(x) be the expected cuts for length x ≥ 1. The recurrence is E(x) = 1 + (1/x)∫₀ˣ E(y) dy. Solving this gives E(x) = 1 + ln x for x ≥ 1. For L = 2016, the expected cuts are 1 + ln(2016).\",\n    \"answer\": \"1+ln(2016)\"\n}",
