  "math_problem": "In $\\triangle A B C$, the incircle centered at $I$ touches sides $A B$ and $B C$ at $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Additionally, the area of quadrilateral $B X I Y$ is $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the area of $A B C$. Let $p$ be the smallest possible perimeter of a $\\triangle A B C$ that meets these conditions and has integer side lengths. Find the smallest possible area of such a triangle with perimeter $p$. Instead of determining the smallest possible area of a triangle satisfying the incircle and area conditions with the minimal integer-sided perimeter, simply find $s$, where $s$ is the semiperimeter of a triangle achieving that minimal perimeter. For a positive integer $n$, let $p(n)$ denote the product of the positive integer factors of $n$. Determine the number of factors $n$ of $(s + 2305)$ for which $p(n)$ is a perfect square.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves finding the semiperimeter $ s $ of a triangle with minimal integer perimeter satisfying specific incircle area conditions, then analyzing factors of $ s + 2305 $. \\n\\n1. **Triangle Analysis**:\\n   - In $ \\\\triangle ABC $, the incircle touches $ AB $ at $ X $ and $ BC $ at $ Y $. The area of quadrilateral $ BXIY $ is $ \\\\frac{2}{5} $ of the area of $ \\\\triangle ABC $.\\n   - Using properties of the incircle, the area ratio simplifies to $ \\\\frac{s - b}{s} = \\\\frac{2}{5} $, leading to $ b = \\\\frac{3}{5}s $, where $ b $ is the side opposite vertex $ B $.\\n   - This implies $ 3(a + c) = 7b $ for sides $ a, b, c $. Setting $ b = 3k $, we get $ a + c = 7k $, and the semiperimeter $ s = 5k $.\\n   - The smallest integer $ k $ yielding valid triangle inequalities is $ k = 1 $, giving sides $ (3, 3, 4) $ with perimeter $ 10 $ and semiperimeter $ s = 5 $.\\n\\n2. **Factor Analysis**:\\n   - Compute $ s + 2305 = 5 + 2305 = 2310 $.\\n   - Factorize $ 2310 = 2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5 \\\\times 7 \\\\times 11 $ (square-free with 5 distinct primes).\\n   - A divisor $ n $ of $ 2310 $ has product of factors $ n^{d(n)/2} $, which is a perfect square iff:\\n     - $ n = 1 $ (trivial case), or\\n     - $ n $ has $ k \\\\geq 2 $ prime factors (since $ d(n) = 2^k $, and $ 2^{k-1} $ is even for $ k \\\\geq 2 $).\\n   - Count valid divisors:\\n     - $ k = 0 $: 1 divisor ($ n = 1 $).\\n     - $ k = 2 $: $ \\\\binom{5}{2} = 10 $.\\n     - $ k = 3 $: $ \\\\binom{5}{3} = 10 $.\\n     - $ k = 4 $: $ \\\\binom{5}{4} = 5 $.\\n     - $ k = 5 $: $ \\\\binom{5}{5} = 1 $.\\n   - Total: $ 1 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 27 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"27\"\n}",
