  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be the answer to this problem. An urn contains white and black balls. There are $n$ white balls and at least two balls of each color in the urn. Two balls are randomly drawn from the urn without replacement. Find the probability, in percent, that the first ball drawn is white and the second is black. Instead of determining the percentage probability of drawing a white ball followed by a black ball without replacement, simply find $d = m - 74$, where $m$ is the total number of balls in the urn derived from the condition that this probability is an integer percentage. Find $x_{2012}$ given that $x_{n+1}=2x_{n}-x_{n-1}+d^{n}$ and $x_{1}=(d - 1)$, $x_{2}=d$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding $x_{2012}$ based on a recurrence relation derived from specific conditions. First, we determine $d = m - 74$, where $m$ is the total number of balls in an urn such that the probability of drawing a white ball followed by a black ball is an integer percentage. \\n\\nThe probability of drawing a white then black ball is $\\\\frac{n(m - n)}{m(m - 1)} \\\\times 100$, where $n$ is the number of white balls and $m = n + b$ (with $b \\\\geq 2$ black balls). For this to be an integer, $m(m - 1)$ must divide $100n(m - n)$.\\n\\nTesting values, we find $m = 76$ works: with $n = 19$ white balls and $b = 57$ black balls, the probability is $\\\\frac{19}{76} \\\\times \\\\frac{57}{75} = \\\\frac{19}{100} = 19\\\\%$, an integer. Thus, $d = 76 - 74 = 2$.\\n\\nNext, solve the recurrence $x_{k+1} = 2x_k - x_{k-1} + 2^k$ with $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 2$. The homogeneous solution is $A + Bk$, and a particular solution is $2^{k+1}$. Using initial conditions, we find $x_k = 2^{k+1} - 3k$. For $k = 2012$, this gives $x_{2012} = 2^{2013} - 6036$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2^{2013} - 6036\"\n}",
