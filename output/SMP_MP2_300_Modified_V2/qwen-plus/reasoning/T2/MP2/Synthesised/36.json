  "math_problem": "Eight points are chosen on the circumference of a circle, labelled $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{8}$ in clockwise order. A route is a sequence of at least two points $P_{a_{1}}, P_{a_{2}}, \\ldots, P_{a_{n}}$ such that if an ant were to visit these points in their given order, starting at $P_{a_{1}}$ and ending at $P_{a_{n}}$, by following $n-1$ straight line segments (each connecting each $P_{a_{i}}$ and $P_{a_{i+1}}$ ), it would never visit a point twice or cross its own path. Find the number of routes. Instead of determining the total number of such routes, simply find $k = r - 1092$, where $r$ is the number of valid routes starting from the designated point $P_8$. Let $A B C D E F G H$ be an equilateral octagon with $\\angle A \\cong \\angle C \\cong \\angle E \\cong \\angle G$ and $\\angle B \\cong \\angle D \\cong \\angle F \\cong \\angle H$. If the area of $A B C D E F G H$ is three times the area of $A C E G$, then $\\sin B$ can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\gcd(m, n)=k$. Find $(k + 99) m+n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two parts. First, determining $ k = r - 1092 $, where $ r $ is the number of valid routes starting from $ P_8 $ on a circle with 8 points. A valid route is a non-crossing path with at least two points.\\n\\n### Part 1: Counting Valid Routes\\n\\nFor a circle with $ m $ other points (excluding the starting point), the number of non-crossing routes starting at a fixed point follows a recursive formula:\\n$$\\nr(m) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\\\left[1 + r(k-1) + r(m-k)\\\\right]\\n$$\\nwith base case $ r(0) = 0 $. Computing step-by-step:\\n- $ r(1) = 1 $\\n- $ r(2) = 4 $\\n- $ r(3) = 13 $\\n- $ r(4) = 40 $\\n- $ r(5) = 121 $\\n- $ r(6) = 364 $\\n- $ r(7) = 1093 $\\n\\nThus, $ r = 1093 $ for 7 other points (starting at $ P_8 $), so $ k = 1093 - 1092 = 1 $.\\n\\n### Part 2: Equilateral Octagon Area Condition\\n\\nGiven an equilateral octagon with alternating angles $ \\\\alpha $ and $ \\\\beta $, where $ \\\\alpha + \\\\beta = 270^\\\\circ $, and area of the octagon is three times the area of quadrilateral $ ACEG $.\\n\\nUsing coordinate geometry and the shoelace formula:\\n- Area of octagon: $ 2(\\\\sin \\\\beta + 1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta) $\\n- Area of $ ACEG $: $ 2(1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta) $\\n\\nSetting $ 2(\\\\sin \\\\beta + 1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta) = 3 \\\\cdot 2(1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta) $, simplifying gives:\\n$$\\n\\\\sin \\\\beta = 2(1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta)\\n$$\\nUsing trigonometric identities, solving yields $ \\\\sin \\\\beta = \\\\frac{4}{5} $. Thus, $ m = 4 $, $ n = 5 $, and $ \\\\gcd(4, 5) = 1 = k $.\\n\\nFinally, compute $ (k + 99)m + n = (1 + 99) \\\\cdot 4 + 5 = 405 $.\", \"answer\": \"405\"}",
