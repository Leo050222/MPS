Evaluate $\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(i+k)(i+2)(i+3)}{(-(k+1))^{i}}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, factorize 2009: 2009 = 7² × 41. After extracting square factors (7²), the remaining odd prime factor is 41. We need to express 41 as 2r² + s² with coprime positive integers r, s. Testing values, 2(4)² + 3² = 32 + 9 = 41, so r = 4, s = 3. gcd(4, 3) = 1, so k = 1 + 0 = 1.\\n\\nNext, evaluate the sum ∑_{i=1}^∞ [(i + k)(i + 2)(i + 3)] / [-(k + 1)]^i with k = 1. This becomes ∑_{i=1}^∞ [(i + 1)(i + 2)(i + 3)] / (-2)^i. Expanding the numerator: (i + 1)(i + 2)(i + 3) = i³ + 6i² + 11i + 6. Using generating functions or known series formulas for |x| < 1 (x = -1/2):\\n\\n∑_{i=1}^∞ (i³ + 6i² + 11i + 6)x^i = [x(1 + 4x + x²)/(1 - x)^4] + 6[x(1 + x)/(1 - x)^3] + 11[x/(1 - x)^2] + 6[x/(1 - x)].\\n\\nSubstituting x = -1/2:\\n- 1 - x = 3/2, so 1/(1 - x) = 2/3.\\n- Calculating each term:\\n  - ∑i³x^i = 2/27,\\n  - 6∑i²x^i = -4/9,\\n  - 11∑ix^i = -22/9,\\n  - 6∑x^i = -2.\\n- Summing these gives -130/27.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-130/27\"\n}",
