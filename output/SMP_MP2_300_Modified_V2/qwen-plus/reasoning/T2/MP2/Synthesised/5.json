  "math_problem": "A committee of 5 is to be chosen from a group of 9 people. How many ways can it be chosen, if Bill and Karl must serve together or not at all, and Alice and Jane refuse to serve with each other? Instead of determining the total number of valid committee selections, simply find $k$, the number of valid committees when the must-serve-together pair is excluded and the refusing-to-serve-together pair is both included. An ant starts out at $(k, k)$. Each second, if it is currently at the square $(x, y)$, it can move to $(x-1, y-1),(x-1, y+1),(x+1, y-1)$, or $(x+1, y+1)$. In how many ways can it end up at $((k + 2010),(k + 2010))$ after $(k + 4020)$ seconds?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ k $, the number of valid committees where Bill and Karl are excluded (so neither is on the committee) and Alice and Jane are both included. However, Alice and Jane refuse to serve together, meaning any committee containing both is invalid. Thus, there are **no valid committees** in this scenario, so $ k = 0 $.\\n\\nNext, the ant starts at $ (k, k) = (0, 0) $ and must reach $ (k + 2010, k + 2010) = (2010, 2010) $ in $ k + 4020 = 4020 $ seconds. Each move changes $ x $ and $ y $ by $ \\\\pm 1 $, so the displacement in $ x $ and $ y $ after 4020 moves must each be 2010.\\n\\nFor the $ x $-displacement: Let $ p $ be the number of $ +1 $ steps and $ q $ be the number of $ -1 $ steps. Then $ p + q = 4020 $ and $ p - q = 2010 $, giving $ p = 3015 $, $ q = 1005 $. The number of ways to choose these steps is $ \\\\binom{4020}{1005} $. The same applies for the $ y $-displacement.\\n\\nSince the $ x $- and $ y $-directions are independent, the total number of paths is $ \\\\left( \\\\binom{4020}{1005} \\\\right)^2 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"C(4020, 1005)^2\"\n}",
