      "A3322": "A rubber band is 4 inches long. An ant begins at the left end. Every minute, the ant walks one inch along rightwards along the rubber band, but then the band is stretched (uniformly) by one inch. For what value of $n$ will the ant reach the right end during the $n$th minute? Instead of determining the minute during which the ant reaches the right end, simply find $e = p + \\frac{23}{4}$, where $p$ is the portion of the rubber band's length traversed by the ant during the first minute accounting for the uniform stretch."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The ant walks 1 inch on a 4-inch rubber band during the first minute, covering 1/4 of the band's length. Stretching uniformly preserves the fraction of the band traversed, so p = 1/4. Thus, e = p + 23/4 = 1/4 + 23/4 = 24/4 = 6.\\n\\nProblem 2: For six students in a row, the total permutations of finishing times are 6! = 720. The number of permutations where no student has to pass another (each finishes at an end of the remaining contiguous block) is 2^(6-1) = 32. The probability of no passing is 32/720 = 2/45. Therefore, the probability that some student must pass another is 1 - 2/45 = 43/45.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"43/45\"\n}",
