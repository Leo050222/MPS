A route is a sequence of at least two points $P_{a_{1}}, P_{a_{2}}, \\ldots, P_{a_{n}}$ such that if an ant were to visit these points in their given order, starting at $P_{a_{1}}$ and ending at $P_{a_{n}}$, by following $n-1$ straight line segments (each connecting each $P_{a_{i}}$ and $P_{a_{i+1}}$ ), it would never visit a point twice or cross its own path. Find the number of routes. Instead of determining the total number of such routes, simply find $k = r - 1092$, where $r$ is the number of valid routes starting from the designated point $P_8$."

For n=8 points, r = (3^7 - 1)/2 = 1093. Thus, k = r - 1092 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: For the equilateral octagon with alternating angles, using coordinate geometry and shoelace formula, the area condition leads to sin(ε_B) = 4/5 where ε_B is the exterior angle at B. Since sin(B) = sin(180° - ε_B) = sin(ε_B), we get sin(B) = 4/5. Thus, m=4, n=5, and 100m + n = 405.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"405\"\n}",
