However, the original problem states that Alice and Jane refuse to serve together, meaning any committee containing both is invalid. Since the requirement for k includes both Alice and Jane being present, which violates the problem's constraints, there are no valid committees meeting these conditions. Thus, k = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: The ant moves diagonally each second, changing both coordinates by ±1. To reach (2010, 2010) in 4020 moves, the net change in x and y must each be 2010. For x, this requires 3015 moves with +1 and 1005 with -1 (since 3015 - 1005 = 2010), giving C(4020, 3015) ways. Similarly for y. Since the choices for x and y directions are independent (each move's x and y components are chosen separately), the total number of paths is [C(4020, 3015)]². Noting that C(4020, 3015) = C(4020, 1005), the answer is [C(4020, 1005)]².\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"C(4020,1005)^2\"\n}",
