Substitute q = 1/2 into equation 3: p + 1/2 + r = 2 ⇒ p + r = 3/2. Use equation 2: p + 2*(1/2) + 3r = 3 ⇒ p + 1 + 3r = 3 ⇒ p + 3r = 2. Subtract p + r = 3/2 from p + 3r = 2: 2r = 1/2 ⇒ r = 1/4. Then p = 3/2 - 1/4 = 5/4. Compute k = p + 311/4 = 5/4 + 311/4 = 316/4 = 79.\\n\\nProblem 2: The sequence must be strictly increasing with each term a multiple of the previous. Let the sequence be a, ar₁, ar₁r₂, ar₁r₂r₃, ar₁r₂r₃r₄, ar₁r₂r₃r₄r₅. Since the sum is 79 (prime), a = 1. The minimal sum with ratios ≥2 is 1+2+4+8+16+32=63. The difference 79-63=16 is achieved by increasing the last ratio from 2 to 3: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 48 (sum 79). The largest number is 48.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"79\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"48\"\n}",
