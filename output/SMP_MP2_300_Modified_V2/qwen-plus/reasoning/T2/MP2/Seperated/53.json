The optimal configuration occurs when the two diameters form angles of $2\\\\pi/3$ and $\\\\pi/3$, and the larger angle ($2\\\\pi/3$) is split into two equal parts of $\\\\pi/3$. This results in five sectors with angles $\\\\pi/3, \\\\pi/3, \\\\pi/3, \\\\pi/3, 2\\\\pi/3$. The smallest sector has a central angle of $\\\\pi/3$, giving an area of $(\\\\pi/3)/2 = \\\\pi/6$. Thus, $a=1$, $b=6$, and $k = b + 4 = 10$.\\n\\nProblem 2: We seek the smallest integer $N > 10$ where the sum of digits in base 10 equals the sum in base 17. Checking sequentially, $N = 153$ is the first such number. In base 10, $1+5+3=9$; in base 17, $153 = 9 \\\\times 17 + 0$, so digits are $9$ and $0$, summing to $9$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"153\"\n}",
