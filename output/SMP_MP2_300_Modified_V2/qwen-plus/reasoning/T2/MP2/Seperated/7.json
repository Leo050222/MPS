Multiplying both sides by $2015$ gives $1 = 403a + 155b + 65c$. We solve for integers $a, b, c$ with $0 \\\\leq a < 5$ and $0 \\\\leq b < 13$. Reducing modulo 65, we find $13a + 25b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{65}$. Testing $a = 2$, we get $25b \\\\equiv 40 \\\\pmod{65}$, which simplifies to $5b \\\\equiv 8 \\\\pmod{13}$. The inverse of 5 modulo 13 is 8, so $b \\\\equiv 64 \\\\equiv 12 \\\\pmod{13}$. Thus $b = 12$, and $L = b + 2004 = 2016$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let $E(L)$ be the expected number of cuts for a string of length $L$. For $L \\\\geq 1$, $E(L) = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{L} \\\\int_0^L E(x) \\\\, dx$ with $E(x) = 0$ for $x < 1$. Differentiating gives $E'(L) = \\\\frac{1}{L}$, so $E(L) = 1 + \\\\ln L$. For $L = 2016$, the expected number of cuts is $1 + \\\\ln(2016)$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2016\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1+ln(2016)\"\n}",
