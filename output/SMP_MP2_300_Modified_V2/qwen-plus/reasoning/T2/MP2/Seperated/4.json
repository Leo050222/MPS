      "A1185": "Let $N$ be a positive integer. Brothers Michael and Kylo each select a positive integer less than or equal to $N$, independently and uniformly at random. Let $p_{N}$ denote the probability that the product of these two integers has a units digit of 0. The maximum possible value of $p_{N}$ over all possible choices of $N$ can be written as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing one hundred times the numerator plus the denominator when the maximum possible value of $p_N$ is expressed as a reduced fraction, simply find $e = \\left(k + \\frac{1973}{100}\\right)$, where $k$ is the maximum possible value of $p_N$ derived from the upper bound analysis of the probability."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability $ p_N $ that the product of two randomly chosen numbers $ \\\\leq N $ has a units digit of 0 depends on the conditions that the product must be divisible by both 2 and 5. This requires at least one even number and at least one multiple of 5. Through analysis of residues modulo 10 and asymptotic behavior, it is found that $ p_N $ reaches its maximum value of $ \\\\frac{27}{100} $ when $ N $ is a multiple of 10. The problem specifies computing $ e = k + \\\\frac{1973}{100} $, where $ k = \\\\frac{27}{100} $. Thus, $ e = \\\\frac{27}{100} + \\\\frac{1973}{100} = \\\\frac{2000}{100} = 20 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find the number of ordered triplets $ (a, b, c) $ with $ 1 \\\\leq a, b, c < 10 $ such that $ abc $ is divisible by 20, we note that 20 = $ 2^2 \\\\times 5 $. The product must include at least one factor of 5 (so at least one of $ a, b, c $ is 5) and at least two factors of 2. By categorizing numbers into sets based on divisibility by 2 and 5, and using inclusion-exclusion principles, the valid triplets are calculated as follows:\\n- Exactly one 5: $ 3 \\\\times 32 = 96 $\\n- Exactly two 5s: $ 3 \\\\times 2 = 6 $\\n- Exactly three 5s: 0\\nTotal: $ 96 + 6 = 102 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"20\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"102\"\n}",
