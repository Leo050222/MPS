Find $a_{N}(0)$. Instead of determining the value of the leading digit polynomial evaluated at zero, simply find $e = (v + 1012)$, where $v = a_{N}(0)$ and $a_{N}(x)$ is the leading digit polynomial in the unique base-$b(x)$ representation."

In base $ b(x) = x^2 + x + 1 $, the leading term of $ S(x) $ is $ x^{2015} $. The leading digit $ a_N(x) $ must satisfy $ \\\\deg(a_N(x)) < 2 $, so it is linear: $ a_N(x) = x + d $. The highest power $ b(x)^N $ contributes $ x^{2N + 1} $, so $ 2N + 1 = 2015 \\\\implies N = 1007 $. The coefficient of $ x^{2014} $ in $ S(x) $ is 1, which equals $ N + d $ (from expanding $ a_N(x)b(x)^N $). Thus, $ 1007 + d = 1 \\\\implies d = -1006 $, so $ a_N(0) = -1006 $. Then $ e = v + 1012 = -1006 + 1012 = 6 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: A regular 6-gon has 14 triangulations (Catalan number $ C_4 $). The only invalid triangulations are those containing a triangle with all sides as diagonals (central triangles $ \\\\{1,3,5\\\\} $ and $ \\\\{2,4,6\\\\} $), which are 2. Thus, valid triangulations are $ 14 - 2 = 12 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
