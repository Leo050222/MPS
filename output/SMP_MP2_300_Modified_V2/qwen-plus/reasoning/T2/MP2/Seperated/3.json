(Rotations and reflections are considered different.) Instead of counting the total number of valid placements satisfying the row, column, and corner avoidance conditions, simply find $s = m - 4$, where $m$ is the number of columns available for the intermediate rows after assigning columns to the boundary rows under the given constraints."

In a move, Sally can move to a point in the lattice exactly one unit away. Given that Sally starts at $(2,1)$, compute the number of possible paths Sally can take."

Boundary rows are rows 1 and 8, each with 6 available columns (2-7). After assigning distinct columns to these two rows (6 choices for row 1, 5 for row 8), 6 columns remain for the intermediate rows (rows 2-7). Thus, m = 6, so s = m - 4 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of Hamiltonian paths on a 3×24 grid starting at (2,1) follows the recurrence a(n) = 2a(n-1) + 2a(n-2) with a(1)=0, a(2)=2.
