Somehow, they have managed to arrange these sticks, such that they form the sides of an equiangular hexagon. Compute the sum of all possible values of the area of this hexagon. Instead of computing the sum of all possible values of the area of this hexagon, simply find $e = (d + 208)$, where $d$ is the smaller possible value of the length of the fourth side in an arrangement starting with the shortest stick as the first side."

Starting with $a = 1$ (shortest stick), valid permutations yield possible fourth sides $d$. Analyzing sums $S = b + c = e + f$, only $S = 8$ and $S = 9$ provide valid configurations. For $S = 9$, $d = 2$ is achievable (e.g., sides $1, 6, 3, 2, 5, 4$), and for $S = 8$, $d = 4$. The smaller $d$ is 2, so $e = 2 + 208 = 210$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The largest 2013-digit base -4 number has digits alternating 3 (even positions) and 0 (odd positions), giving $N = \\\\frac{16^{1007} - 1}{5}$. Using modular arithmetic and the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $N \\\\mod 210$ is computed by solving congruences modulo 2, 3, 5, and 7. The solution yields $N \\\\equiv 51 \\\\mod 210$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"210\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"51\"\n}",
