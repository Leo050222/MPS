The problem defines k as the number of ways to choose all five numbers congruent to 0 modulo 3 (which is C(5,5)=1) plus the number of ways to choose two numbers congruent to 1 modulo 3 in a valid combination for the sum divisible by 3. The valid case with two numbers ≡1 mod3 is when there are also two ≡2 mod3 and one ≡0 mod3 (sum: 2*1 + 2*2 + 1*0 = 6 ≡ 0 mod3). The number of ways for this case is C(5,2)*C(5,2)*C(5,1) = 10*10*5 = 500. Thus, k = 1 + 500 = 501.\\n\\nProblem 2: φ(n) = 11³ + 1 = 1332. n must be a product of three primes (allowing multiplicity). Testing n = 37² * 2: φ(37² * 2) = φ(37²) * φ(2) = (37² - 37) * 1 = 1332, which matches. n = 37² * 2 = 2738 is a product of three primes (37, 37, 2). Another solution is 3² * 223 = 2007, but the problem mentions '37²·3…', suggesting 37² is a factor, so 2738 is the intended answer.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"501\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2738\"\n}",
