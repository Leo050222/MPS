After 80 balls are moved from Box $A$ to Box $B$, the ratio of balls in Box $A$ to Box $B$ is now $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1$. Find $100p+q$. Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio."

The ratio $ \\\\frac{n/2 - 80}{n + 80} = \\\\frac{p}{q} $ with $ \\\\gcd(p, q) = 1 $. Since $ p $ and $ q $ are coprime, $ g = \\\\gcd(p, q) = 1 $. Thus, $ k = g + 3 = 4 $. The value of $ n $ is irrelevant to $ g $, as the simplified ratio always has $ \\\\gcd 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The trapezoid has vertices at $ (0,0) $, $ (5,0) $, $ (4,4) $, $ (0,4) $. Midpoints of sides are calculated. The two segments connecting midpoints intersect at $ (2.25, 2) $. Using the shoelace formula, regions have areas $ 19/4 $ (two regions) and $ 17/4 $ (two regions). The difference $ d = 19/4 - 17/4 = 1/2 $. Thus, $ 240d = 120 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"120\"\n}",
