Instead of computing the probability that at least three dice show the same value among four rolls, simply find $g = \\binom{4}{3} - 3$, where $\\binom{4}{3}$ is the number of ways to choose which three dice match in the exactly three matching case derived from the event decomposition."

One day, as President Reif walks down the Infinite Corridor, he notices that a digit zero on a room sign has fallen off. Let $N$ be the original number of the room, and let $M$ be the room number as shown on the sign. The smallest interval containing all possible values of $\\frac{M}{N}$ can be expressed as $\\left[\\frac{a}{b}, \\frac{c}{d}\\right)$ where $a, b, c, d$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=\\operatorname{gcd}(c, d)=1$.

The maximum ratio approaches $ \\\\frac{2}{11} $ as $ N $ has a zero followed by many 9s (e.g., $ N = 10999\\\\ldots9 $), but never reaches $ \\\\frac{2}{11} $. Thus, the interval is $ \\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{10}, \\\\frac{2}{11}\\\\right) $.
