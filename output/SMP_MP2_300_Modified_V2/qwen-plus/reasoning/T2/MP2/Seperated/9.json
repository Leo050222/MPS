A known Egyptian fraction decomposition of 1 is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/42 = 1. Here, 2 is included, and the pair (3, 7) are distinct odd primes. The LCM of {2, 3, 7, 42} is 42. Thus, ℓ = 42, so k = 42 - 10 = 32.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a random permutation π of {1, ..., 100}, the conditions π²⁰(20) = 20 and π²¹(21) = 21 require the cycle lengths of 20 and 21 to divide 20 and 21, respectively. Divisors of 20 are {1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20} (6 divisors), and divisors of 21 are {1, 3, 7, 21} (4 divisors). The joint probability is (6 × 4) / (100 × 99) = 24/9900 = 2/825. Thus, a = 2, b = 825, and 100a + b = 1025.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"32\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1025\"\n}",
