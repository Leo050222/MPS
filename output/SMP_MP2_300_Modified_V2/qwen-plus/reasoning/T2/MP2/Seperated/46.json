Rearranging inequalities gives $ r \\\\geq \\\\frac{2s - 3}{3} $ and $ r \\\\leq 4s - 12 $. Testing integer values, the smallest valid ratio occurs at $ (r, s) = (2, 4) $ or $ (3, 6) $, both yielding $ \\\\frac{r}{s} = \\\\frac{1}{2} $. No smaller ratio satisfies both inequalities.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/2\"\n}",
