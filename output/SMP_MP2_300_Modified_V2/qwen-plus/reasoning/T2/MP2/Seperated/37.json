If $A X=6, X Y=4$, and $Y E=7$, then the area of pentagon $A B C D E$ can be written as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are integers, $c$ is positive, $b$ is square-free, and $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$. Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of determining the encoded numerical representation of the pentagon's area in radical form, simply find $k = CE - 8$, where $CE$ is the common length of the specified equal chords derived from the given segment lengths along the intersecting lines."

Using intersecting chords theorem: AX·XC = BX·XD and BY·YD = CY·YE. Let AC = BD = CE = L. Then XC = L - 6, CY = L - 7. Let BX = x, XD = L - x. From AX·XC = BX·XD: 6(L - 6) = x(L - x). For Y: BY = x + 4 (if X between B and Y), YD = L - (x + 4), so (x + 4)(L - x - 4) = 7(L - 7). Solving these equations, valid solution requires L ≤ 12 (from cosine constraint in cyclic quadrilateral). Only L = 9 satisfies all conditions (L = 17 invalid as cos(a/2) > 1). Thus CE = 9, k = CE - 8 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Unit square ABCD with A(0,0), B(1,0), C(1,1), D(0,1). Circle tangent to AB (y=0) at E(h,0), so center (h, r) with r = 32/49. Distance from center to D(0,1) equals radius: h² + (1 - r)² = r² ⇒ h² = 2r - 1. DE = √(h² + 1) = √(2r) = √(64/49) = 8/7. Thus m = 8, n = 7, 100m + n = 807.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"807\"\n}",
