First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill 11. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The system of equations is solved by expressing y and z in terms of x using the third equation. Subtracting the first two equations gives (x - 1)(z - y) = 11. Using substitution and simplification, a quadratic equation in x is derived: x² - 18x + 72 = 0, with roots x = 6 and x = 12. The smaller root for x + 1 is 7 (from x = 6). Substituting x = 6 into the equations gives z = 38/5. Thus, k = z + 17/5 = 38/5 + 17/5 = 55/5 = 11.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using linearity of expectation, the expected number of games Alice plays is calculated by considering her interactions with lower-skilled (L) and higher-skilled (H) players. For each L player, the probability Alice faces them is 2/(12×11) = 1/66 (due to relative ordering with H players). With 10 L players, this contributes 10/66 = 5/33. Alice always faces exactly one H player (the first H encountered), contributing 1. Total expectation is 1 + 5/33 = 38/33.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"38/33\"\n}",
