Let $p$ be the probability that for every positive integer $k<10$, there exists an integer $k^{\\prime}>k$ such that there is at most one number between $k$ and $k^{\\prime}$ in the circle. If $p$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing one hundred times the numerator plus the denominator when the probability is expressed as a reduced fraction, simply find $k = p + \\frac{167}{90}$, where $p$ is the probability for the circular arrangement satisfying the given condition."

Analysis shows that for k=1-4, the condition is always satisfied due to the pigeonhole principle (more larger numbers than outside positions). For k=5-9, the critical constraint is that the arrangement must avoid gaps where all larger numbers are too far. Through detailed consideration of valid configurations and recognizing the problem's structure, the probability p is determined to be 13/90. Adding 167/90 gives k = 13/90 + 167/90 = 180/90 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: The system x² + y = 12 and y² + x = 12 is solved by subtracting equations to find (x - y)(x + y - 1) = 0. Case 1 (x = y) yields solutions (3, 3) and (-4, -4). Case 2 (x + y = 1) leads to quadratic solutions involving √5, resulting in two additional pairs. All real solutions are verified to satisfy both equations.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(3,3), (-4,-4), ((1+3√5)/2,(1-3√5)/2), ((1-3√5)/2,(1+3√5)/2)\"\n}",
