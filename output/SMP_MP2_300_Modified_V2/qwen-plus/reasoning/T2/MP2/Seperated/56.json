However, 74 = 37 × 2 ends in 4, so f(74) = 0. By additivity, f(74) = f(37) + f(2). Since 4 ends in 4, f(4) = 0 = 2f(2) ⇒ f(2) = 0. Thus, 0 = f(37) + 0 ⇒ f(37) = 0. Hence, k = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of paths from (0,0) to (4,4) without crossing y > x is the 4th Catalan number. The formula is Cₙ = (1/(n+1)) × binomial(2n, n). For n=4, C₄ = (1/5) × 70 = 14.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"14\"\n}",
