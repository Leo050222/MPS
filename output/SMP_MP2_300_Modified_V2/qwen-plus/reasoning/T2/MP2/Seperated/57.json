For a 7-gon, n=7, so the number of triangulations N is the 5th Catalan number, C_5 = 42. Thus, k = N - 41 = 42 - 41 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The perimeter of the intersection region R depends on c = x + y + z where P = (x,y,z) is uniform in [0,1]^3. For 0 ≤ c ≤ 1 and 2 < c ≤ 3, the perimeter is 3c√2 and 3(3-c)√2 respectively; for 1 < c ≤ 2, it is constant 3√2. The expected perimeter t is computed by integrating over c with the Irwin-Hall pdf. The calculation yields t = (11√2)/4, so t² = 121/8. Thus, a=121, b=8, and 100a + b = 12108.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"12108\"\n}",
