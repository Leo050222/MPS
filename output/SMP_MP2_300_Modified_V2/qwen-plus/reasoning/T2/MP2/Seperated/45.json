Compute gcd(2002, 2001). Since 2002 - 2001 = 1, gcd(2002, 2001) = 1. Thus, q = 1 + 2001 = 2002.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find f(2002), note that 2002 + 46 = 2048 = 2^11, so f(2002) + f(46) = 11² = 121. Next, 46 + 18 = 64 = 2^6 ⇒ f(46) + f(18) = 36. Then 18 + 14 = 32 = 2^5 ⇒ f(18) + f(14) = 25. Further, 14 + 2 = 16 = 2^4 ⇒ f(14) + f(2) = 16. Finally, 2 + 2 = 4 = 2^2 ⇒ 2f(2) = 4 ⇒ f(2) = 2. Back-substituting: f(14) = 14, f(18) = 11, f(46) = 25, so f(2002) = 121 - 25 = 96.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2002\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"96\"\n}",
