Now he walks from $(0,0)$ to $(8,0)$ without ever going below the $x$-axis. How many such paths are there? Instead of counting the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,0) that never go below the x-axis, simply find $k = m - 49$, where $m$ is the number of lattice paths from (0,-2) to (8,0) using steps of (+1,+1) or (+1,-1) derived from the reflection principle to count paths that violate the non-negativity condition."

The total x-change is 8, so U + D = 8. The y-change is 0 - (-2) = 2, so U - D = 2. Solving gives U = 5, D = 3. The number of paths is C(8,5) = 56. Thus, m = 56. Then k = m - 49 = 56 - 49 = 7.\\n\\nProblem 2: Multiples of 7 that are perfect squares must be of the form (7k)² = 49k². We need 10⁶ ≤ 49k² ≤ 10⁹. Solving for k: k ≥ ceil(√(10⁶/49)) = 143 and k ≤ floor(√(10⁹/49)) = 4517. The count is 4517 - 143 + 1 = 4375.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"7\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4375\"\n}",
