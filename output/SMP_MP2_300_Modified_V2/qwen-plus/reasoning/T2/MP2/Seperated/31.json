Two balls are randomly drawn from the urn without replacement. Find the probability, in percent, that the first ball drawn is white and the second is black. Instead of determining the percentage probability of drawing a white ball followed by a black ball without replacement, simply find $d = m - 74$, where $m$ is the total number of balls in the urn derived from the condition that this probability is an integer percentage."

The probability that the first ball is white and the second is black is $ \\\\frac{n(m - n)}{m(m - 1)} \\\\times 100 $, where $ n $ is the number of white balls. This percentage must be an integer. After testing values, $ m = 76 $ satisfies the condition with $ n = 19 $ (white balls) and $ m - n = 57 $ (black balls), yielding a probability of 19%. Thus, $ d = m - 74 = 76 - 74 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The recurrence relation $ x_{n+1} = 2x_n - x_{n-1} + 2^n $ with $ x_1 = 1 $, $ x_2 = 2 $ is solved by finding the homogeneous solution $ A + Bn $ and a particular solution $ 2^{n+1} $. Combining these and applying initial conditions gives $ x_n = 2^{n+1} - 3n $. For $ n = 2012 $, $ x_{2012} = 2^{2013} - 3 \\\\times 2012 = 2^{2013} - 6036 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2^{2013} - 6036\"\n}",
