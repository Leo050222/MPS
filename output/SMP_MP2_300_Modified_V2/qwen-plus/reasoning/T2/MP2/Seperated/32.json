The variance of a single digit is (7^2 - 1)/12 = 4. Thus, Var(S) = 20 * 4 = 80. Then m = 80 - 65 = 15.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given 3003 appears in Pascal's triangle at specified positions. C(14,6)=3003, so the last two positions are confirmed. C(15,b)=3003 implies b=5 (since C(15,5)=3003). C(a,2)=3003 solves to a=78 (78*77/2=3003).
