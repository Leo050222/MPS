In each pair, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is knocked out of the tournament. The probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other during the tournament is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of evaluating the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator representing the probability that the two designated players meet during the tournament, simply find $e = b - 16$, where $b$ is the denominator of that probability when expressed as a reduced fraction."

For N players (a power of 2), the probability any two players meet is 2/N. Here, N=32, so probability is 2/32 = 1/16. The denominator b=16, so e = b - 16 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: For very small x > 0, expand (1+x)^10 ≈ 1 + 10x. The fraction becomes [1 - (1+10x)]/[1 + (1+10x)] = (-10x)/(2 + 10x) ≈ -5x. Multiplying by x^p gives -5x^{p+1}. To have this approach a constant c ≠ 0 as x→0, the exponent must be 0, so p = -1. Then the expression approaches -5, so c = -5. The ordered pair is (-1, -5).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(-1, -5)\"\n}",
