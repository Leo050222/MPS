      "A1433": "During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^{2}$. Instead of determining the real part of the square of the starting point, simply find $k = |z| - 1$, where $|z|$ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days."

The ID number satisfies the following property: the first two digits is a number divisible by 2, the first three digits is a number divisible by 3, etc. so that the ID number itself is divisible by 6. One ID number that satisfies this condition is 123252. How many different possibilities are there for Bob's ID number?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The total path lengths on both days must be equal. On Saturday, the path length is the sum of distances between consecutive odd-powered terms starting from z, and on Sunday, it's the sum for even-powered terms starting from 1. Let r = |z|. The Saturday path length S = r * T, where T is the Sunday path length. For S = T, r must be 1. Thus, k = |z| - 1 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: The ID number must satisfy divisibility conditions for each prefix. Key steps:\\n- D5 = 5 (divisible by 5).\\n- D2 must be even (2,4,6,8).\\n- For each D1 (1-9) and D2, D3 must make the sum D1+D2+D3 divisible by 3 (3 choices for D3).\\n- For each D3, D4 must form a number with D3 divisible by 4 (2 choices for D4), and D6 must be even with D4+D6 ≡ 1 mod 3 (total 3 valid (D4,D6) pairs per D3).\\n- Total combinations: 9 (D1) * 4 (D2) * 3 (D3) * 3 ((D4,D6)) = 324.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"324\"\n}",
