She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, but sushi is sticky, and Wendy can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi, assuming that the pieces of sushi are distinguishable? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row."

The induced subgraph adjacencies are B-E, D-E, E-F. The bottom-right piece F is adjacent only to E, so deg(F) = 1. Thus, k = 1 + 0 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a, b ∈ [0,1], the triangle with sides a, b, 1 is obtuse if 1 is the longest side (always true) and a² + b² < 1, while satisfying the triangle inequality a + b > 1. The valid region is the area inside the unit circle quadrant (a² + b² < 1) and above the line a + b = 1. This area is the circular segment: π/4 - 1/2. Hence, the probability is π/4 - 1/2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"pi/4 - 1/2\"\n}",
