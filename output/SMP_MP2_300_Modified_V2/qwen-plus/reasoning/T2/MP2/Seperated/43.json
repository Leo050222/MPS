Squaring both sides gives $a^2 + b + 2a\\\\sqrt{b} = 15 + \\\\sqrt{216}$. Equating rational and irrational parts:\\n- $a^2 + b = 15$\\n- $2a\\\\sqrt{b} = \\\\sqrt{216} = 6\\\\sqrt{6}$\\n\\nFrom the second equation, $a\\\\sqrt{b} = 3\\\\sqrt{6}$, so squaring gives $a^2b = 54$. Solving $a^2 + b = 15$ and $a^2b = 54$, let $x = a^2$, then $x(15 - x) = 54$. This quadratic yields $x = 9$ (since $x = 6$ isn't a perfect square). Thus, $a^2 = 9 \\\\implies a = 3$ (positive root), and $b = 6$. The problem asks for $k = a + 3 = 6$.\\n\\nProblem 2: This is a modified coupon collector problem where no consecutive repeats are allowed. For $n = 6$, the expected number of rolls to collect all numbers is $1 + (n-1) \\\\cdot H_{n-1}$, where $H_{n-1}$ is the $(n-1)$th harmonic number. Here, $H_5 = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{5} = \\\\frac{137}{60}$. Thus, the expected value is $1 + 5 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{137}{60} = \\\\frac{149}{12}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"149/12\"\n}",
