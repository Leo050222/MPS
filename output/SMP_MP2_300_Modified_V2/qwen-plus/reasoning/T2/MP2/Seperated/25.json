      "A2212": "Nine fair coins are flipped independently and placed in the cells of a 3 by 3 square grid. Let $p$ be the probability that no row has all its coins showing heads and no column has all its coins showing tails. If $p=\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator of the desired probability in lowest terms, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the sum of the probability that a specific row does not have all heads and the probability that a specific row has all heads."

Godzilla inscribes square $C A S H$ in $\\omega_{1}$ and regular pentagon $M O N E Y$ in $\\omega_{2}$. It then writes down all 20 (not necessarily distinct) distances between a vertex of $C A S H$ and a vertex of $M O N E Y$ and multiplies them all together. What is the maximum possible value of his result?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The problem asks for k, the sum of the probability that a specific row does not have all heads and the probability that it does. For a single row of 3 coins, the probability of all heads is (1/2)^3 = 1/8. The probability of not all heads is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8. Their sum is 7/8 + 1/8 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The product of all 20 distances between vertices of the square (radius 1) and pentagon (radius 2) is maximized when the rotation angle θ is chosen to maximize the product. Using complex numbers and trigonometric identities, the product of (5 - 4 cos Δθ) terms simplifies to (2^20 + 1)^2. Taking the square root gives the maximum product of distances as 2^20 + 1 = 1048577.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1048577\"\n}",
