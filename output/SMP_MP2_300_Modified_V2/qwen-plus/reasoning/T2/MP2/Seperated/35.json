Let $a$ be the proportion of pixels that are black. Estimate $A=\\lfloor 10000 a\\rfloor$.

Calculating 1,048,576 - 1,048,572 gives k = 4.\\n\\nProblem 2: The optimal strategy is to always play rock, as playing scissors never results in a win. Each game has a 50% chance of winning (computer plays scissors) and 50% tie. The number of wins in 8 games follows a binomial distribution with n=8 and p=0.5. The probability of winning at least 4 games is the sum of probabilities for 4 to 8 wins. Calculating the binomial coefficients: C(8,4)=70, C(8,5)=56, C(8,6)=28, C(8,7)=8, C(8,8)=1. Total favorable outcomes = 70+56+28+8+1=163. Total possible outcomes = 2^8=256. Thus, the probability is 163/256.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"163/256\"\n}",
