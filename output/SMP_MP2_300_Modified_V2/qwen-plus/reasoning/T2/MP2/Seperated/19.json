Instead of computing the maximum possible sum of two positive integers not exceeding 100 that satisfy the given equation relating their product to the square of the ratio of their least common multiple to their greatest common divisor, simply find $m = s - 77$, where $s$ is that maximum possible sum."

Let $d = \\\\gcd(a,b)$, so $a = d \\\\cdot m$, $b = d \\\\cdot n$ with $\\\\gcd(m,n) = 1$. Then $m \\\\cdot n = d^2$, implying $m = s^2$, $n = t^2$ where $\\\\gcd(s,t) = 1$ and $d = s \\\\cdot t$. Thus, $a = s^3 t$, $b = s t^3$. Checking valid pairs within 100, the maximum sum $a + b$ is 78 (e.g., $a=24$, $b=54$). Then $m = 78 - 77 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: To avoid axis-parallel rectangles, no two rows can share two red columns. Using the Zarankiewicz problem $z(5,5,2,2)$, the maximum number of red squares in a $5 \\\\times 5$ grid without rectangles is 12. A valid construction includes one row with 4 red squares and four rows with 2 red squares each, totaling 12. Attempts to reach 13 violate the column pair constraint.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
