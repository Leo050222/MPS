Determine the number of ordered pairs of composite positive integers $(m, n)$ for which $L(m) L(n)=80$. Instead of determining the number of ordered pairs of composite positive integers whose largest proper factors have product equal to the given integer, simply find $k = N(40) + 0$, where $N(d)$ is the number of primes less than or equal to the smallest prime factor of $d$."

The smallest prime factor of 40 is 2. Primes ≤ 2 are [2], so N(40) = 1. Thus, k = 1 + 0 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: A square inscribed in a circle of radius 1 has its diagonal equal to the circle's diameter (2). For a square with side length s, diagonal = s√2 = 2 ⇒ s = √2.
