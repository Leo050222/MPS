  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Instead of determining the number of partitions of the set into pairs that form a single cell, simply find $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game.

  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-part problem. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of a \"consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell\"\n\nThe problem says:\n\n> Given a set $ A $ with $ n \\geq 1 $ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $ A $. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair.\n\nSo:\n- A **2-configuration** involves **pairs**, i.e., 2-element subsets.\n- It's **consistent**, and forms a **partition** of $ A $ — meaning the pairs are disjoint and their union is all of $ A $.\n- An **order 1** 2-configuration with **exactly 1 cell** consists of **exactly one pair**.\n\nSince it's a partition of $ A $ into pairs, and there's exactly **one pair**, then $ A $ must consist of **exactly 2 elements**, because a pair has size 2, and the pair must equal $ A $ (since it's a partition with one part).\n\nSo:\n- The only way a partition of $ A $ into pairs has exactly one pair is if $ |A| = 2 $.\n- So $ n = 2 $.\n\nThen it says:\n\n> Instead of determining the number of partitions... simply find $ k = n + 5 $, where $ n $ is the cardinality of the set $ A $ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell.\n\nSo:\n- $ n = 2 $\n- $ k = 2 + 5 = 7 $\n\n✅ So $ k = 7 $\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Now interpret the second part:\n\n> A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $ \\frac{2}{3} $ of winning any given game. What is the probability that **exactly $ k $ games** will need to be played to determine a winner?\n\nWe found $ k = 7 $, so we want the probability that the series ends **in exactly 7 games**, i.e., one team reaches its 5th win **on the 7th game**, and before that, it had exactly 4 wins in the first 6 games (and the opponent had 2 wins), and then wins game 7.\n\nNote: Since it's first to 5 wins, the series ends as soon as a team gets its 5th win. So for the series to end in exactly 7 games, one team must get its 5th win on game 7 ⇒ that team must have exactly 4 wins in the first 6 games, and the other team has 2 wins (since 4 + 2 = 6). Then the team wins game 7.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n- Mathletes win in exactly 7 games.\n- Opponent wins in exactly 7 games.\n\nBut the question asks: “What is the probability that exactly $ k $ games will need to be played to determine a winner?” — i.e., total probability that series ends at game 7.\n\nLet’s compute both.\n\nLet $ p = \\frac{2}{3} $ = Mathletes’ win probability per game  \nThen opponent’s win probability = $ q = \\frac{1}{3} $\n\n#### Case 1: Mathletes win in exactly 7 games  \n- They must have exactly 4 wins in first 6 games → number of ways: $ \\binom{6}{4} $  \n- Probability of each such sequence: $ p^4 q^{2} $  \n- Then they win game 7: multiply by $ p $  \n→ Total: $ \\binom{6}{4} p^5 q^2 $\n\n#### Case 2: Opponent wins in exactly 7 games  \n- Opponent must have 4 wins in first 6 games → $ \\binom{6}{4} $ ways  \n- Each such sequence has probability $ q^4 p^2 $  \n- Then opponent wins game 7: multiply by $ q $  \n→ Total: $ \\binom{6}{4} p^2 q^5 $\n\nSo total probability =  \n$$\n\\binom{6}{4} \\left( p^5 q^2 + p^2 q^5 \\right)\n$$\n\nCompute:\n\n- $ \\binom{6}{4} = 15 $\n- $ p = \\frac{2}{3},\\ q = \\frac{1}{3} $\n- $ p^5 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5 = \\frac{32}{243} $\n- $ q^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9} $\n- So $ p^5 q^2 = \\frac{32}{243} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{32}{2187} $\n\n- $ p^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{9} $\n- $ q^5 = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{243} $\n- So $ p^2 q^5 = \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{243} = \\frac{4}{2187} $\n\nAdd them: $ \\frac{32 + 4}{2187} = \\frac{36}{2187} $\n\nMultiply by 15:  \n$ 15 \\cdot \\frac{36}{2187} = \\frac{540}{2187} $\n\nSimplify fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 9:  \n540 ÷ 9 = 60  \n2187 ÷ 9 = 243  \n\nSo $ \\frac{60}{243} $\n\nDivide by 3 again:  \n60 ÷ 3 = 20  \n243 ÷ 3 = 81  \n\nSo $ \\frac{20}{81} $\n\nCheck: 20 and 81 share no common factors (81 = 3⁴, 20 = 2²·5), so simplified.\n\n✅ So probability = $ \\frac{20}{81} $\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"A consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell must consist of a single pair, which partitions the set A; thus |A| = n = 2. Therefore k = n + 5 = 7. For a best-of-9 series (first to 5 wins), the probability that exactly 7 games are played equals the probability that one team gets its 5th win on game 7. This requires that team to have exactly 4 wins in the first 6 games and win game 7. With Mathletes' win probability p = 2/3 and opponent's q = 1/3, the total probability is binom(6,4) * (p^5 q^2 + p^2 q^5) = 15 * (32/2187 + 4/2187) = 15 * 36/2187 = 540/2187 = 20/81.\",  \n    \"answer\": \"20/81\"\n}",
