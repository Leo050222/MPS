  "math_problem": "After walking so much that his feet get really tired, the beaver staggers so that, at each step, his coordinates change by either (+1,+1) or (+1,-1). Now he walks from (0,0) to (8,0) without ever going below the x-axis. How many such paths are there? Instead of counting the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,0) that never go below the x-axis, simply find $k = m - 49$, where $m$ is the number of lattice paths from (0,-2) to (8,0) using steps of (+1,+1) or (+1,-1) derived from the reflection principle to count paths that violate the non-negativity condition. How many multiples of $k$ between $(k + 3)^{6}$ and $(k + 3)^{9}$ are perfect squares?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a combinatorial path-counting problem involving lattice paths with steps (+1, +1) and (+1, −1), i.e., up-right and down-right steps (like Dyck paths but on a slanted grid). Let's parse the problem carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the original path counting\n\nThe beaver walks from (0,0) to (8,0), using only steps:\n\n- U = (+1, +1) — up-right  \n- D = (+1, −1) — down-right  \n\nSo each step increases x by 1. To go from x = 0 to x = 8, exactly **8 steps**, each of which changes y by ±1.\n\nLet number of U steps = u, D steps = d. Then:\n\n- u + d = 8 (total steps)\n- net y-change = u·(+1) + d·(−1) = u − d = 0 ⇒ u = d ⇒ u = d = 4.\n\nSo total unrestricted paths from (0,0) to (8,0) = C(8,4) = 70.\n\nBut we require paths that **never go below the x-axis**, i.e., y ≥ 0 at all intermediate points (including start? yes, (0,0) is okay).\n\nThis is a classic **Dyck path**-like problem, but note: usual Dyck paths go from (0,0) to (2n,0) with up (1,1) and down (1,−1), staying nonnegative — exactly our case! Here n = 4, since 8 steps, 4 ups, 4 downs.\n\nSo number of such Dyck paths = Catalan number C₄ = (1/5)·C(8,4) = (1/5)·70 = 14.\n\nBut the problem does **not** ask for that count directly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Define m and k\n\n> Instead of counting the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,0) that never go below the x-axis, simply find $k = m - 49$, where $m$ is the number of lattice paths from (0,−2) to (8,0) using steps of (+1,+1) or (+1,−1) derived from the reflection principle to count paths that violate the non-negativity condition.\n\nSo m is defined as the number of paths from (0, −2) to (8, 0) with steps U = (+1,+1), D = (+1,−1).\n\nLet’s compute m.\n\nEach step increases x by 1 → need 8 steps.\n\nLet u = #U steps, d = #D steps ⇒ u + d = 8.\n\nNet y-change: starts at y = −2, ends at y = 0 ⇒ total y-change = +2.\n\nEach U contributes +1, each D contributes −1 ⇒ u − d = +2.\n\nSo:\n\nu + d = 8  \nu − d = 2  \nAdd: 2u = 10 ⇒ u = 5, d = 3.\n\nSo number of such paths = C(8,5) = C(8,3) = 56.\n\nThus m = 56.\n\nThen k = m − 49 = 56 − 49 = **7**.\n\n✅ So k = 7.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Count multiples of k = 7 between $(k + 3)^6$ and $(k + 3)^9$ that are perfect squares.\n\nk = 7 ⇒ k + 3 = 10.\n\nSo we consider the interval:\n\n- Lower bound: $10^6 = 1{,}000{,}000$  \n- Upper bound: $10^9 = 1{,}000{,}000{,}000$\n\nWe want **multiples of 7** in [10⁶, 10⁹] that are **perfect squares**.\n\nThat is, integers N such that:\n\n- $10^6 \\le N \\le 10^9$  \n- $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$  \n- $N = s^2$ for some integer s.\n\nSo equivalently: find integers s such that:\n\n- $s^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$ ⇒ $s \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$, because 7 is prime ⇒ s must be divisible by 7.\n\nLet s = 7t, then N = (7t)² = 49t².\n\nNow impose:\n\n$10^6 \\le 49t^2 \\le 10^9$\n\nDivide by 49:\n\n$\\frac{10^6}{49} \\le t^2 \\le \\frac{10^9}{49}$\n\nCompute bounds:\n\n- $10^6 = 1{,}000{,}000$  \n- $10^9 = 1{,}000{,}000{,}000$\n\nCompute:\n\n- $10^6 / 49 ≈ 20408.163...$  \n- $10^9 / 49 ≈ 20{,}408{,}163.265...$\n\nSo:\n\n$t^2 \\in [20408.163..., 20408163.265...]$\n\nSo t must satisfy:\n\n- $t \\ge \\lceil \\sqrt{10^6 / 49} \\rceil = \\lceil \\sqrt{20408.163...} \\rceil$  \n- $t \\le \\lfloor \\sqrt{10^9 / 49} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\sqrt{20408163.265...} \\rfloor$\n\nCompute square roots:\n\nFirst, $\\sqrt{20408.163...}$:\n\nNote: $142^2 = 20164$, $143^2 = 20449$. Since 20408.16 < 20449, and > 20164, so √20408.16 ≈ 142.86 ⇒ ceil = **143**\n\nCheck: 142² = 20164 < 20408.16 → too small  \n143² = 20449 > 20408.16 → okay, so smallest integer t with t² ≥ 20408.16 is t = 143.\n\nNow upper bound: $\\sqrt{20{,}408{,}163.265...}$\n\nLet’s estimate:\n\n- $4500^2 = 20{,}250{,}000$  \n- $4517^2 = ?$ Try 4517²:\n\nWe can compute more precisely.\n\nNote: $ \\sqrt{20{,}408{,}163.265} \\approx ? $\n\nSince $4517^2 = (4500 + 17)^2 = 4500² + 2·4500·17 + 17² = 20,250,000 + 153,000 + 289 = 20,403,289$\n\nStill less than 20,408,163.\n\nTry 4518² = 4517² + 2·4517 + 1 = 20,403,289 + 9034 + 1 = 20,412,324 → too big.\n\nSo 4517² = 20,403,289  \n4518² = 20,412,324\n\nOur upper limit is ~20,408,163.265, so max t² ≤ that ⇒ t ≤ 4517.\n\nCheck 4517² = 20,403,289 ≤ 20,408,163.265 → yes  \n4518² = 20,412,324 > → no.\n\nSo t_max = 4517.\n\nThus t ranges from 143 to 4517 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers from a to b inclusive = b − a + 1.\n\nSo count = 4517 − 143 + 1 = 4517 − 142 = 4375.\n\nWait: 4517 − 143 = 4374; +1 = **4375**\n\nLet’s verify arithmetic:\n\n4517 − 143 =  \n4517 − 100 = 4417  \n4417 − 43 = 4374  \n+1 = 4375 ✅\n\nSo there are **4375** integers t such that t ∈ [143, 4517], and thus 4375 values of N = 49t² in [10⁶, 10⁹] that are perfect squares and divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait — is every such N a multiple of 7? Yes: N = 49t² = 7·(7t²), so divisible by 7.\n\nAlso, N is a perfect square by construction.\n\nAnd we ensured $10^6 \\le N \\le 10^9$.\n\nSo answer is **4375**.\n\nBUT — double-check endpoints:\n\n- Smallest N = 49 × 143²  \nCompute 143² = 20449  \n49 × 20449 = ?\n\n20449 × 50 = 1,022,450  \nMinus 20449 = 1,022,450 − 20,449 = 1,002,001\n\nSo N_min = 1,002,001 ≥ 1,000,000 → OK.\n\n- Largest N = 49 × 4517²  \nWe had 4517² = 20,403,289  \n49 × 20,403,289 = ?\n\nCompute 20,403,289 × 50 = 1,020,164,450  \nMinus 20,403,289 = 1,020,164,450 − 20,403,289 = 999,761,161\n\nWhich is < 1,000,000,000 → OK.\n\nNext t = 4518 gives N = 49 × 4518² = 49 × 20,412,324 = let's approximate: ~20.412M × 49 ≈ 1,000,203,876 > 10⁹ → excluded.\n\nSo yes, t = 143 to 4517 inclusive is correct.\n\nCount = 4517 − 143 + 1 = 4375.\n\n✅\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We first determined k by computing m, the number of lattice paths from (0,-2) to (8,0) with steps (+1,+1) and (+1,-1). Solving u + d = 8 and u - d = 2 gives u = 5, d = 3, so m = C(8,5) = 56. Thus k = m - 49 = 7. Next, we counted perfect squares that are multiples of k = 7 in the interval [10^6, 10^9], since k + 3 = 10. A perfect square divisible by 7 must be of the form (7t)^2 = 49t^2. Solving 10^6 ≤ 49t^2 ≤ 10^9 gives t^2 ∈ [10^6/49, 10^9/49] ≈ [20408.16, 20408163.27], so t ∈ [143, 4517]. The count is 4517 - 143 + 1 = 4375.\",  \n    \"answer\": \"4375\"\n}",
