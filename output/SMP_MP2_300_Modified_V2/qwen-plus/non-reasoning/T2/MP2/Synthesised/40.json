  "reasoning_content": "We are given a system of three linear equations:\n\n1. $ p + 3q + r = 3 $  \n2. $ p + 2q + 3r = 3 $  \n3. $ p + q + r = 2 $\n\nWe are to solve for $ p $, then compute $ k = p + \\frac{311}{4} $, and then use that $ k $ as the **sum** of a strictly increasing sequence of six positive integers where each term (after the first) is a multiple of the previous one — i.e., a geometric-like sequence with integer ratios (but not necessarily constant ratio; just each term divisible by the prior). Then find the **largest number** in that sequence.\n\nLet’s proceed step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Solve the linear system for $ p, q, r $\n\nWe have:\n\n- Eq (A): $ p + 3q + r = 3 $  \n- Eq (B): $ p + 2q + 3r = 3 $  \n- Eq (C): $ p + q + r = 2 $\n\nSubtract Eq (C) from Eq (A):\n\n(A) − (C):  \n$ (p + 3q + r) - (p + q + r) = 3 - 2 $  \n→ $ 2q = 1 $ → $ q = \\frac{1}{2} $\n\nSubtract Eq (C) from Eq (B):\n\n(B) − (C):  \n$ (p + 2q + 3r) - (p + q + r) = 3 - 2 $  \n→ $ q + 2r = 1 $\n\nWe already have $ q = \\frac{1}{2} $, so:\n\n$ \\frac{1}{2} + 2r = 1 $ → $ 2r = \\frac{1}{2} $ → $ r = \\frac{1}{4} $\n\nNow plug $ q = \\frac{1}{2}, r = \\frac{1}{4} $ into Eq (C) to get $ p $:\n\n$ p + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 2 $  \n→ $ p + \\frac{3}{4} = 2 $  \n→ $ p = 2 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{5}{4} $\n\nSo $ p = \\frac{5}{4} $\n\nThen compute:\n\n$ k = p + \\frac{311}{4} = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{311}{4} = \\frac{316}{4} = 79 $\n\nSo $ k = 79 $\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find a strictly increasing sequence of **six positive integers**, say:\n\n$ a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4 < a_5 < a_6 $, all positive integers,\n\nsuch that for each $ i = 2 $ to $ 6 $, $ a_i $ is a **multiple** of $ a_{i-1} $, i.e., $ a_i = m_i a_{i-1} $, where $ m_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 2} $ (since strictly increasing and positive integers ⇒ multiplier at least 2).\n\nAlso, sum $ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = 79 $\n\nWe need to find the **largest possible value of $ a_6 $**, given these constraints? Wait — no: the problem says:\n\n> I have written a strictly increasing sequence of six positive integers, such that each number (besides the first) is a multiple of the one before it, and the sum of all six numbers is $ k $. What is the largest number in my sequence?\n\nIt doesn’t say “maximize” — it implies there is a unique such sequence? Or perhaps only one possible? Let's check.\n\nWe need to find **any** such sequence of six positive integers, strictly increasing, each divides the next (i.e., $ a_{i} \\equiv 0 \\mod a_{i-1} $), summing to 79, and report $ a_6 $.\n\nBut likely only one such sequence exists — because 79 is small, and growing multiplicatively with integer multipliers ≥ 2 quickly blows up.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nLet $ a_1 = x $, a positive integer.\n\nThen:\n\n- $ a_2 = x \\cdot m_2 $, $ m_2 \\ge 2 $\n- $ a_3 = a_2 \\cdot m_3 = x \\cdot m_2 m_3 $, $ m_3 \\ge 2 $\n- ...\n- $ a_6 = x \\cdot m_2 m_3 m_4 m_5 m_6 $\n\nLet $ M = m_2 m_3 m_4 m_5 m_6 $, product of five integers ≥ 2 ⇒ $ M \\ge 2^5 = 32 $\n\nSo $ a_6 = x M \\ge 32x $\n\nAlso, sum:\n\n$ S = x + x m_2 + x m_2 m_3 + x m_2 m_3 m_4 + x m_2 m_3 m_4 m_5 + x m_2 m_3 m_4 m_5 m_6 = x(1 + m_2 + m_2 m_3 + m_2 m_3 m_4 + m_2 m_3 m_4 m_5 + M) = 79 $\n\nSince all terms are integers, $ x $ must be a positive integer divisor of 79.\n\n79 is prime ⇒ divisors are 1 and 79.\n\nIf $ x = 79 $, then even the first term is 79, but we need six positive terms summing to 79 ⇒ impossible (minimum sum would be 79 + ... > 79). So $ x = 1 $\n\nThus $ a_1 = 1 $\n\nSo now the sum becomes:\n\n$ 1 + m_2 + m_2 m_3 + m_2 m_3 m_4 + m_2 m_3 m_4 m_5 + m_2 m_3 m_4 m_5 m_6 = 79 $\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nLet $ b_1 = 1 $  \n$ b_2 = m_2 $  \n$ b_3 = m_2 m_3 $  \n$ b_4 = m_2 m_3 m_4 $  \n$ b_5 = m_2 m_3 m_4 m_5 $  \n$ b_6 = m_2 m_3 m_4 m_5 m_6 $\n\nSo $ b_i $ is increasing, each $ b_i = b_{i-1} \\cdot m_i $, $ m_i \\ge 2 $, integer.\n\nSo $ b_1 = 1 $  \n$ b_2 \\ge 2 $  \n$ b_3 \\ge 2b_2 \\ge 4 $  \n$ b_4 \\ge 2b_3 \\ge 8 $  \n$ b_5 \\ge 2b_4 \\ge 16 $  \n$ b_6 \\ge 2b_5 \\ge 32 $\n\nSum $ b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 + b_5 + b_6 = 79 $\n\nTry minimal growth: all multipliers = 2 ⇒ geometric sequence with ratio 2:\n\nThen $ b_i = 2^{i-1} $:  \n1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 → sum = 1+2+4+8+16+32 = 63 < 79\n\nNeed sum = 79 ⇒ need 16 more.\n\nWe can increase some multipliers to make later terms larger, but keep total sum 79.\n\nWe want to find such a sequence — and then report $ a_6 = b_6 $.\n\nNote: Since $ a_1 = 1 $, $ a_i = b_i $.\n\nSo find integers $ b_1=1 < b_2 < b_3 < b_4 < b_5 < b_6 $, each dividing the next, sum = 79.\n\nLet’s try to build from start.\n\nLet’s suppose multipliers are $ m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5, m_6 \\ge 2 $, integers.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- $ b_1 = 1 $  \n- $ b_2 = a $, $ a \\ge 2 $  \n- $ b_3 = a b $, $ b \\ge 2 $  \n- $ b_4 = a b c $, $ c \\ge 2 $  \n- $ b_5 = a b c d $, $ d \\ge 2 $  \n- $ b_6 = a b c d e $, $ e \\ge 2 $\n\nSo sum:\n\n$ S = 1 + a + ab + abc + abcd + abcde = 79 $\n\nWe can attempt small values.\n\nStart with minimal case: all multipliers = 2 → gives sum 63 as above.\n\nDifference: 79 − 63 = 16.\n\nWe need to distribute extra 16 among terms by increasing some multipliers.\n\nNote: Increasing an earlier multiplier increases all subsequent terms.\n\nLet’s list the base (all 2s) terms:\n\n- $ b_1 = 1 $  \n- $ b_2 = 2 $  \n- $ b_3 = 4 $  \n- $ b_4 = 8 $  \n- $ b_5 = 16 $  \n- $ b_6 = 32 $  \nSum = 63\n\nNow, suppose we increase $ m_2 $ from 2 to 3. Then:\n\n- $ b_2 = 3 $ (+1)  \n- $ b_3 = 3 × 2 = 6 $ (+2)  \n- $ b_4 = 6 × 2 = 12 $ (+4)  \n- $ b_5 = 12 × 2 = 24 $ (+8)  \n- $ b_6 = 24 × 2 = 48 $ (+16)  \nTotal increase = 1+2+4+8+16 = 31 → new sum = 63 + 31 = 94 > 79 → too big.\n\nWhat if we increase $ m_6 $ only? That affects only $ b_6 $. Currently $ b_6 = 32 $, and $ b_5 = 16 $, so $ m_6 = b_6 / b_5 = 32/16 = 2 $. If we set $ m_6 = 3 $, then $ b_6 = 16×3 = 48 $, increase by 16 → sum becomes 63 + 16 = 79 ✅\n\nCheck if valid:\n\n- $ b_1 = 1 $  \n- $ b_2 = 2 $  \n- $ b_3 = 4 $  \n- $ b_4 = 8 $  \n- $ b_5 = 16 $  \n- $ b_6 = 48 $  \n\nCheck divisibility:\n\n- 2 / 1 = 2 ✔  \n- 4 / 2 = 2 ✔  \n- 8 / 4 = 2 ✔  \n- 16 / 8 = 2 ✔  \n- 48 / 16 = 3 ✔  \n\nAll multipliers integers ≥ 2, strictly increasing (1,2,4,8,16,48 — yes, 48 > 16), all positive integers.\n\nSum = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 48 = let's compute:\n\n1+2 = 3  \n3+4 = 7  \n7+8 = 15  \n15+16 = 31  \n31+48 = 79 ✔\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo the sequence is: $ 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 48 $, and the largest number is $ 48 $.\n\nIs there another possible sequence? Let's see if other options give different $ a_6 $.\n\nSuppose instead we increase $ m_5 $: currently $ m_5 = b_5 / b_4 = 16/8 = 2 $. Change to 3 ⇒ $ b_5 = 8×3 = 24 $, then $ b_6 = 24×2 = 48 $ (if $ m_6 = 2 $), then sum becomes:\n\n1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 24 + 48 = 87 > 79.\n\nToo big.\n\nWhat if $ m_5 = 3 $, $ m_6 = 1 $? Not allowed — must be ≥ 2.\n\nWhat if $ m_4 = 3 $: then\n\n- $ b_1 = 1 $  \n- $ b_2 = 2 $  \n- $ b_3 = 4 $  \n- $ b_4 = 4×3 = 12 $  \n- $ b_5 = 12×2 = 24 $  \n- $ b_6 = 24×2 = 48 $  \nSum = 1+2+4+12+24+48 = 91 > 79.\n\nToo big.\n\nWhat if we try $ m_2 = 2, m_3 = 2, m_4 = 2, m_5 = 2, m_6 = 3 $ → we already did that → $ a_6 = 48 $\n\nWhat if $ m_6 = 4 $: then $ b_6 = 16×4 = 64 $, sum = 1+2+4+8+16+64 = 95 > 79.\n\nSo 48 seems minimal possible $ a_6 $ for sum 79? But question asks \"What is the largest number in my sequence?\" — implying uniqueness.\n\nIs there a sequence with larger $ a_6 $? To get larger $ a_6 $, need smaller earlier terms, but $ a_1 = 1 $ is forced (since 79 is prime), and minimal growth gives smallest $ a_6 $, but we increased last multiplier to hit exact sum.\n\nCould we have non-minimal early multipliers but compensate with smaller later ones? No, because multipliers must be integers ≥ 2, and sequence must be strictly increasing ⇒ each $ a_i > a_{i-1} $, so $ m_i \\ge 2 $ always.\n\nWait — actually, $ m_i $ could be 1? No, because then $ a_i = a_{i-1} $, not strictly increasing. So $ m_i \\ge 2 $ is required.\n\nHence minimal possible $ a_2 = 2 $, etc.\n\nSo the only way to reach sum 79 from base 63 is to add 16 to the last term, i.e., set $ a_6 = 32 + 16 = 48 $, as done.\n\nAlternatively, could we have different structure? For example, $ a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 6 $ (i.e., $ m_3 = 3 $), then $ a_4 $ must be multiple of 6, say 12, then $ a_5 $ multiple of 12, say 24, $ a_6 $ multiple of 24, say 48? Let's test:\n\n1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 → sum = 1+2+6+12+24+48 = 93 > 79.\n\nToo big.\n\nTry smaller: 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, ? → sum so far = 1+2+6+12+24 = 45, need $ a_6 = 79 - 45 = 34 $, but 34 not multiple of 24 → invalid.\n\nTry 1, 2, 6, 12, ? — sum so far 1+2+6+12 = 21, need last two terms sum to 58, with $ a_5 $ multiple of 12, $ a_6 $ multiple of $ a_5 $.\n\nLet $ a_5 = 12k $, $ a_6 = 12k \\cdot m $, $ k,m \\ge 2 $\n\nThen $ a_5 + a_6 = 12k(1 + m) = 58 $? But 58 not divisible by 12 → impossible.\n\nTry $ a_1 = 1, a_2 = 3 $: then $ a_3 \\ge 6 $, $ a_4 \\ge 12 $, $ a_5 \\ge 24 $, $ a_6 \\ge 48 $, sum ≥ 1+3+6+12+24+48 = 94 > 79.\n\nSo $ a_2 = 2 $ is forced.\n\nSimilarly, $ a_3 $ must be multiple of 2, minimal is 4. If we take $ a_3 = 6 $, then as above sum explodes.\n\nSo only viable sequence is 1,2,4,8,16,48.\n\nThus largest number is 48.\n\n✅\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Solving the system yields p = 5/4, so k = p + 311/4 = 316/4 = 79. Since k = 79 is prime, the only possible first term of the six-term strictly increasing sequence where each term divides the next is a_1 = 1. Starting from the minimal geometric progression with ratio 2 (1,2,4,8,16,32) sums to 63. To reach sum 79, we need an additional 16, which can be added to the last term by changing its multiplier from 2 to 3, giving a_6 = 16 * 3 = 48. The resulting sequence is (1,2,4,8,16,48), summing to 79 and satisfying all conditions. Thus the largest number is 48.\",  \n    \"answer\": \"48\"  \n}",
