  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n**Statement Recap:**\n\n- Eli delivers milk in the complex plane.\n- **Saturday**: starts at $ z $, then visits $ z^3, z^5, z^7, \\dots, z^{2013} $ — i.e., odd powers from 3 to 2013 inclusive.\n- **Sunday**: starts at $ 1 $, then visits $ z^2, z^4, z^6, \\dots, z^{2012} $ — even powers from 2 to 2012 inclusive.\n- He walks straight-line distances between consecutive points.\n- The **total distance from starting point to last house** is $ \\sqrt{2012} $ on **both days**.\n\nWait! Let's re-read carefully:\n\n> \"If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $ \\sqrt{2012} $ on both days...\"\n\nThat wording is ambiguous: does it mean the *total path length* (sum of all segment lengths), or just the straight-line distance from start to final point?\n\nIt says: *\"the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house\"*. That sounds like just the Euclidean distance between start and final point — i.e., $ |z^{2013} - z| = \\sqrt{2012} $ on Saturday, and $ |z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012} $ on Sunday.\n\nYes — “from his starting point to the last house” means direct distance, not sum over all legs.\n\nSo:\n\n- Saturday: start at $ z $, last house is $ z^{2013} $ ⇒ distance = $ |z^{2013} - z| = \\sqrt{2012} $\n- Sunday: start at $ 1 $, last house is $ z^{2012} $ ⇒ distance = $ |z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012} $\n\nSo we have:\n\n$$\n|z^{2013} - z| = |z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012}\n$$\n\nLet’s factor:\n\n- $ |z^{2013} - z| = |z(z^{2012} - 1)| = |z| \\cdot |z^{2012} - 1| $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n|z| \\cdot |z^{2012} - 1| = |z^{2012} - 1|\n$$\n\nAssuming $ |z^{2012} - 1| \\ne 0 $, we can divide both sides:\n\n$$\n|z| = 1\n$$\n\nBut wait — then $ |z| = 1 $, so $ k = |z| - 1 = 0 $. Is that possible? Let's verify.\n\nIf $ |z| = 1 $, then $ |z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012} $. But for a complex number $ w $ on the unit circle, $ |w - 1| \\le 2 $, since max distance between two points on unit circle is 2 (antipodal). But $ \\sqrt{2012} \\approx \\sqrt{2025} = 45 $, so $ \\sqrt{2012} \\approx 44.86 $, which is way larger than 2.\n\nContradiction! So our assumption that $ |z^{2012} - 1| \\ne 0 $ must be wrong? But if $ |z^{2012} - 1| = 0 $, then $ z^{2012} = 1 $, so $ |z^{2012} - 1| = 0 $, but RHS is $ \\sqrt{2012} \\ne 0 $, contradiction.\n\nSo something is off.\n\nLet’s double-check interpretation.\n\nOriginal statement:\n\n> Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $ \\sqrt{2012} $ on both days...\n\nWait — maybe it's the **total walking distance**, i.e., sum of all segment lengths? That would make more sense, because otherwise the numbers don’t match.\n\nLet’s test that.\n\n- Saturday path: $ z \\to z^3 \\to z^5 \\to \\dots \\to z^{2013} $\n\nHow many segments? Powers: 3,5,...,2013 → arithmetic sequence with difference 2.\n\nNumber of terms: $ \\frac{2013 - 3}{2} + 1 = \\frac{2010}{2} + 1 = 1005 + 1 = 1006 $ points? Wait: first term 3, last 2013, common diff 2:\n\nNumber of odd exponents from 3 to 2013 inclusive:\n\nGeneral odd numbers: $ 2k+1 $. Set $ 2k+1 = 3 \\Rightarrow k = 1 $; $ 2k+1 = 2013 \\Rightarrow k = 1006 $. So k from 1 to 1006 ⇒ 1006 terms.\n\nSo positions visited: $ z $ (start), then 1006 houses ⇒ total of 1006 segments:  \n$ |z^3 - z| + |z^5 - z^3| + |z^7 - z^5| + \\dots + |z^{2013} - z^{2011}| $\n\nSimilarly, Sunday: starts at 1, then $ z^2, z^4, ..., z^{2012} $. Even exponents from 2 to 2012.\n\nNumber of even exponents: $ \\frac{2012 - 2}{2} + 1 = \\frac{2010}{2} + 1 = 1005 + 1 = 1006 $ houses.\n\nSo segments: $ |z^2 - 1| + |z^4 - z^2| + \\dots + |z^{2012} - z^{2010}| $: also 1006 segments.\n\nSo both paths have same number of segments: 1006.\n\nNow, suppose $ z $ lies on real axis? Or perhaps $ z $ is real and positive? Try assuming $ z $ is real and > 0.\n\nThen all powers are real and increasing if $ z > 1 $, decreasing if $ 0 < z < 1 $.\n\nThen distances become absolute differences:\n\nSaturday total distance:\n$$\n|z^3 - z| + |z^5 - z^3| + \\dots + |z^{2013} - z^{2011}| = |z^{2013} - z|\n$$\nBecause it's telescoping if all terms same sign! Indeed, if $ z > 0 $, and $ z \\ne 1 $, then sequence $ z, z^3, z^5, \\dots $ is monotonic, so absolute differences sum to total change: $ |z^{2013} - z| $. Same for Sunday: $ |z^{2012} - 1| $.\n\nSo again we get same equations:\n\n$$\n|z^{2013} - z| = |z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012}\n$$\n\nBut earlier we saw that leads to contradiction unless $ |z| $ is large.\n\nLet’s suppose $ z $ is real and positive: $ z > 0 $. Then:\n\n- $ |z^{2013} - z| = z^{2013} - z = \\sqrt{2012} $ if $ z > 1 $\n- $ |z^{2012} - 1| = z^{2012} - 1 = \\sqrt{2012} $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nz^{2012} = 1 + \\sqrt{2012} \\\\\nz^{2013} = z \\cdot z^{2012} = z(1 + \\sqrt{2012}) = z + \\sqrt{2012}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nz(1 + \\sqrt{2012}) = z + \\sqrt{2012} \\\\\nz + z\\sqrt{2012} = z + \\sqrt{2012} \\\\\nz\\sqrt{2012} = \\sqrt{2012} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow z = 1\n$$\n\nBut if $ z = 1 $, then $ z^{2012} = 1 $, so $ |z^{2012} - 1| = 0 \\ne \\sqrt{2012} $. Contradiction.\n\nWhat if $ 0 < z < 1 $? Then $ z^{2012} < 1 $, so $ |z^{2012} - 1| = 1 - z^{2012} = \\sqrt{2012} \\Rightarrow z^{2012} = 1 - \\sqrt{2012} < 0 $, impossible.\n\nSo $ z $ cannot be real positive.\n\nTry $ z $ real negative? Let $ z = -r $, $ r > 0 $. Then powers alternate sign.\n\n- $ z^3 = -r^3 $, $ z^5 = -r^5 $, etc. All odd powers negative if $ z < 0 $, even powers positive.\n\nSo Saturday: start at $ z = -r $, then $ z^3 = -r^3 $, $ z^5 = -r^5 $, ..., $ z^{2013} = -r^{2013} $. Since 2013 is odd.\n\nSo sequence: $ -r, -r^3, -r^5, \\dots, -r^{2013} $. If $ r > 1 $, magnitudes increase, so values become more negative: sequence decreasing (more negative), so distances: $ |-r^3 + r| + |-r^5 + r^3| + \\dots + |-r^{2013} + r^{2011}| = r - r^3 + r^3 - r^5 + \\dots + r^{2011} - r^{2013} = r - r^{2013} $. So total = $ r - r^{2013} $. But this is positive only if $ r^{2013} < r \\Rightarrow r^{2012} < 1 \\Rightarrow r < 1 $. So $ 0 < r < 1 $.\n\nThen $ z = -r $, $ 0 < r < 1 $, so $ z^{2012} = r^{2012} > 0 $, and $ |z^{2012} - 1| = 1 - r^{2012} = \\sqrt{2012} $ → again impossible.\n\nSo $ z $ must be complex.\n\nLet’s go back to the key equation:\n\n$$\n|z^{2013} - z| = |z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012}\n$$\n\nLet $ w = z^{2012} $. Then $ z^{2013} = z \\cdot w $, so:\n\n$$\n|z w - z| = |z| \\cdot |w - 1| = \\sqrt{2012} \\\\\n|w - 1| = \\sqrt{2012}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n|z| \\cdot \\sqrt{2012} = \\sqrt{2012} \\Rightarrow |z| = 1\n$$\n\nAgain we get $ |z| = 1 $, but then $ |w - 1| = |z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012} $, impossible since $ |z^{2012}| = 1 $, so max $ |z^{2012} - 1| = 2 $.\n\nThus, our interpretation must be wrong.\n\nLet’s read original problem again carefully:\n\n> During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $ z $ and delivers milk to houses located at $ z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013} $, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $ z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012} $, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $ \\sqrt{2012} $ on both days, find the real part of $ z^{2} $. Instead of determining the real part of the square of the starting point, simply find $ k = |z| - 1 $, where $ |z| $ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days.\n\nWait! There's a crucial sentence at the end:\n\n> \"...find the real part of $ z^{2} $. Instead of determining the real part of the square of the starting point, simply find $ k = |z| - 1 $, where $ |z| $ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the **equality of the total path lengths on both days**.\"\n\nAh! So it's not that each total path equals $ \\sqrt{2012} $, but rather that the **two total path lengths are equal**, and that common value is $ \\sqrt{2012} $. But the key condition used to find $ |z| $ is the *equality*: total Saturday distance = total Sunday distance.\n\nAnd *that equality* allows solving for $ |z| $, and then $ k = |z| - 1 $.\n\nSo let’s define:\n\nLet $ S = $ total distance Saturday = $ \\sum_{j=1}^{n} |z^{2j+1} - z^{2j-1}| $, where exponents go from $ z^1 = z $ (start) to $ z^{2013} $, odd powers: $ z^1, z^3, z^5, ..., z^{2013} $. Wait — does he start at $ z $, then go to $ z^3 $, so first segment is $ |z^3 - z| $, then $ |z^5 - z^3| $, ..., last is $ |z^{2013} - z^{2011}| $. So number of segments = number of houses delivered to = number of terms in $ z^3, z^5, ..., z^{2013} $ = let's compute:\n\nFirst exponent 3, last 2013, step 2: number = $ \\frac{2013 - 3}{2} + 1 = \\frac{2010}{2} + 1 = 1005 + 1 = 1006 $ segments.\n\nSimilarly, Sunday: start at 1, then $ z^2, z^4, ..., z^{2012} $: exponents 2 to 2012 step 2: $ \\frac{2012 - 2}{2} + 1 = 1005 + 1 = 1006 $ segments.\n\nSo both sums have 1006 terms.\n\nNow, assume $ z $ is a complex number with $ |z| = r $. Then $ |z^k| = r^k $.\n\nThe distance between $ z^a $ and $ z^b $ is $ |z^a - z^b| $. Not easy in general, but if all points lie on a ray from origin (i.e., same argument), i.e., $ z $ is real positive, then they are collinear and distances add up telescopically.\n\nBut earlier that led to contradiction unless $ r = 1 $, which doesn't work.\n\nAlternative idea: Suppose $ z $ is such that all the points $ z, z^3, z^5, \\dots $ lie on a straight line through origin — i.e., $ z $ is real or pure imaginary? Let's suppose $ z $ is real and $ z > 0 $. Then as before:\n\nSaturday total = $ |z^{2013} - z| $, Sunday total = $ |z^{2012} - 1| $. Setting them equal:\n\n$$\n|z^{2013} - z| = |z^{2012} - 1|\n$$\n\nLet $ x = z > 0 $. So:\n\n$$\n|x^{2013} - x| = |x^{2012} - 1|\n$$\n\nFactor left: $ x|x^{2012} - 1| = |x^{2012} - 1| $\n\nSo either $ |x^{2012} - 1| = 0 \\Rightarrow x^{2012} = 1 \\Rightarrow x = 1 $ (since x > 0), but then both sides 0, but problem says distance is $ \\sqrt{2012} $, so not this case.\n\nOr $ x = 1 $, same.\n\nOtherwise, $ x = 1 $ is only solution to equality, but contradicts distance value.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"If the distance [...] is $ \\sqrt{2012} $ on both days\", i.e., the common value is $ \\sqrt{2012} $. So we have:\n\n$$\n|z^{2013} - z| = |z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012}\n$$\n\nAnd from $ |z^{2013} - z| = |z| \\cdot |z^{2012} - 1| $, we get:\n\n$$\n|z| \\cdot \\sqrt{2012} = \\sqrt{2012} \\Rightarrow |z| = 1\n$$\n\nSo $ k = |z| - 1 = 0 $\n\nBut earlier we worried about $ |z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012} $ being impossible for |z|=1. However, the problem doesn't require that to hold in reality — it's a hypothetical condition to solve for $ z $, and perhaps in complex numbers with |z| ≠ 1, but math forces |z| = 1.\n\nMaybe the problem expects us to ignore the geometric impossibility and just do the algebra: from equality of the two distances (which are $ |z^{2013} - z| $ and $ |z^{2012} - 1| $), we get $ |z| = 1 $, so $ k = 0 $.\n\nMoreover, the problem says \"find $ k = |z| - 1 $, where $ |z| $ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days.\"\n\nSo the equality gives $ |z| = 1 $, hence $ k = 0 $.\n\nI think answer is 0.\n\nLet’s tentatively go with **answer_1 = \"0\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\nBob's Rice ID number has six digits, each from 1 to 9 (no zeros), digits can repeat.\n\nLet the ID be $ d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4 d_5 d_6 $, each $ d_i \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,9\\} $.\n\nConditions:\n\n- The number formed by first $ k $ digits is divisible by $ k $, for $ k = 1 $ to $ 6 $.\n\nThat is:\n\n- $ d_1 $ divisible by 1 → always true (any digit 1–9)\n- $ 10 d_1 + d_2 $ divisible by 2 → last digit $ d_2 $ must be even → $ d_2 \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\} $\n- $ 100 d_1 + 10 d_2 + d_3 $ divisible by 3 → sum of digits $ d_1+d_2+d_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $\n- First 4-digit number divisible by 4 → last two digits $ d_3 d_4 $ form number divisible by 4\n- First 5-digit number divisible by 5 → last digit $ d_5 $ must be 5 (since digits are 1–9, no 0, so only possibility is 5)\n- First 6-digit number divisible by 6 → must be divisible by 2 and 3. Since divisible by 2, $ d_6 $ even; and sum $ d_1+\\dots+d_6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $\n\nAlso, all digits 1–9, no zero.\n\nLet’s proceed step by step.\n\nLet ID = $ d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4 d_5 d_6 $\n\n**Step 1: $ d_5 = 5 $** (due to divisibility by 5, and no 0 allowed)\n\nSo $ d_5 = 5 $\n\n**Step 2: $ d_2 \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\} $** (for divisibility by 2)\n\n**Step 3: $ d_6 \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\} $** (for divisibility by 2, since whole number must be even)\n\n**Step 4: Divisibility by 4: number $ 10 d_3 + d_4 $ must be divisible by 4**\n\nSo $ 10 d_3 + d_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} $. Since $ 10 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} $, so $ 2 d_3 + d_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} $\n\n$ d_3, d_4 \\in \\{1,\\dots,9\\} $\n\n**Step 5: Divisibility by 3 for first 3 digits: $ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $**\n\n**Step 6: Divisibility by 6 for full number: already ensured by even $ d_6 $ and digit sum divisible by 3. So need $ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 + d_6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $. Since $ d_5 = 5 $, and $ 5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} $, so sum $ \\equiv d_1+d_2+d_3+d_4+d_6 + 2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\Rightarrow d_1+d_2+d_3+d_4+d_6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} $\n\nBut also from step 5: $ d_1+d_2+d_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $, so $ d_4 + d_6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} $\n\nSo constraint: $ d_4 + d_6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} $\n\nAlso $ d_2 \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\} $, $ d_6 \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\} $, $ d_4 \\in \\{1..9\\} $, $ d_3 \\in \\{1..9\\} $, $ d_1 \\in \\{1..9\\} $, $ d_5 = 5 $\n\nWe need to count number of 6-tuples satisfying all.\n\nLet’s use constructive counting.\n\nWe'll iterate over choices with constraints.\n\nStart with $ d_5 = 5 $ fixed.\n\nLet’s list possible $ d_2 $: 4 choices (2,4,6,8)\n\n$ d_6 $: 4 choices (2,4,6,8)\n\nFor each pair $ (d_2, d_6) $, we’ll count possibilities for other digits.\n\nBut dependencies:\n\n- $ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $ → for fixed $ d_2 $, $ d_1 + d_3 \\equiv -d_2 \\pmod{3} $\n\n- $ 2 d_3 + d_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} $\n\n- $ d_4 + d_6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} $\n\nSo for fixed $ d_6 $, $ d_4 \\equiv 1 - d_6 \\pmod{3} $, i.e., $ d_4 \\mod 3 $ is determined.\n\nSince $ d_4 \\in [1,9] $, for each residue mod 3, there are 3 choices: e.g., if $ d_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $, then $ d_4 \\in \\{3,6,9\\} $; if $ \\equiv 1 $, $ \\{1,4,7\\} $; if $ \\equiv 2 $, $ \\{2,5,8\\} $\n\nSo 3 choices for $ d_4 $ given its required residue.\n\nSimilarly, for $ d_3 $, once $ d_4 $ is chosen, $ 2 d_3 \\equiv -d_4 \\pmod{4} $. Since 2 and 4 are not coprime, solutions exist only if $ -d_4 $ is even, i.e., $ d_4 $ even.\n\nBecause $ 2 d_3 \\mod 4 $ can be 0 or 2 only (since 2*odd=2 mod 4, 2*even=0 mod 4). So $ d_4 $ must be even or odd accordingly.\n\nLet’s solve $ 2 d_3 \\equiv -d_4 \\pmod{4} $\n\nPossible $ d_4 \\mod 4 $: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 → residues 1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1\n\nSo $ -d_4 \\mod 4 $: if $ d_4 \\equiv 0 $, then $ -d_4 \\equiv 0 $; if $ d_4 \\equiv 1 $, $ -d_4 \\equiv 3 $; $ d_4 \\equiv 2 $, $ -d_4 \\equiv 2 $; $ d_4 \\equiv 3 $, $ -d_4 \\equiv 1 $\n\nEquation $ 2 d_3 \\equiv c \\pmod{4} $ has solutions iff $ c $ is even, i.e., $ c \\equiv 0 $ or $ 2 \\mod 4 $. So $ -d_4 \\equiv 0 $ or $ 2 \\mod 4 $ ⇒ $ d_4 \\equiv 0 $ or $ 2 \\mod 4 $\n\nSo $ d_4 \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\} $ (even digits) — since 1–9, evens are 2,4,6,8 — all ≡ 0 or 2 mod 4? 2≡2, 4≡0, 6≡2, 8≡0. Yes.\n\nSo $ d_4 \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\} $ — 4 choices.\n\nThen for each such $ d_4 $, solve $ 2 d_3 \\equiv -d_4 \\pmod{4} $\n\n- If $ d_4 = 2 $, $ -d_4 \\equiv 2 \\mod 4 $, so $ 2 d_3 \\equiv 2 \\mod 4 \\Rightarrow d_3 $ odd: $ d_3 \\in \\{1,3,5,7,9\\} $ — 5 choices\n\n- If $ d_4 = 4 $, $ -d_4 \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 $, so $ 2 d_3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\Rightarrow d_3 $ even: $ d_3 \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\} $ — 4 choices\n\n- If $ d_4 = 6 $, same as $ d_4 = 2 $ (since 6 ≡ 2 mod 4), so $ d_3 $ odd: 5 choices\n\n- If $ d_4 = 8 $, same as $ d_4 = 4 $, $ d_3 $ even: 4 choices\n\nSo for $ d_4 \\in \\{2,6\\} $: 5 options for $ d_3 $; for $ d_4 \\in \\{4,8\\} $: 4 options.\n\nNow, recall $ d_4 + d_6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} $\n\n$ d_6 \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\} $, so $ d_6 \\mod 3 $: 2→2, 4→1, 6→0, 8→2\n\nSo $ d_6 $ residues mod 3:  \n- $ d_6 = 2 $: 2  \n- $ d_6 = 4 $: 1  \n- $ d_6 = 6 $: 0  \n- $ d_6 = 8 $: 2  \n\nSo $ d_4 \\equiv 1 - d_6 \\pmod{3} $\n\nLet’s tabulate for each $ d_6 $, required $ d_4 \\mod 3 $, and which of {2,4,6,8} satisfy.\n\n- $ d_6 = 2 $: need $ d_4 \\equiv 1 - 2 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 $. So $ d_4 \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 $. From {2,4,6,8}: 2≡2, 4≡1, 6≡0, 8≡2 → so $ d_4 = 2 $ or $ 8 $ → 2 choices\n\n- $ d_6 = 4 $: need $ d_4 \\equiv 1 - 1 = 0 \\mod 3 $.

So $ d_4 \\equiv 1 $: from set, 4≡1 → only $ d_4 = 4 $ → 1 choice\n\n- $ d_6 = 8 $: same as $ d_6 = 2 $, need $ d_4 \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 $: $ d_4 = 2 $ or $ 8 $ → 2 choices\n\nSo total $ (d_4, d_6) $ pairs: for $ d_6=2 $: 2 options; $ d_6=4 $: 1; $ d_6=6 $: 1; $ d_6=8 $: 2 → total 6 pairs.\n\nList them:\n\n- $ d_6 = 2 $: $ d_4 = 2, 8 $\n- $ d_6 = 4 $: $ d_4 = 6 $\n- $ d_6 = 6 $: $ d_4 = 4 $\n- $ d_6 = 8 $: $ d_4 = 2, 8 $\n\nNow for each, number of $ d_3 $:\n\n- $ d_4 = 2 $: $ d_3 $ odd → 5 choices (1,3,5,7,9)\n- $ d_4 = 4 $: $ d_3 $ even → 4 choices (2,4,6,8)\n- $ d_4 = 6 $: same as $ d_4 = 2 $ (6 ≡ 2 mod 4) → 5 choices\n- $ d_4 = 8 $: same as $ d_4 = 4 $ → 4 choices\n\nSo:\n\n- Pair (d4=2, d6=2): 5 d3\n- (d4=8, d6=2): 4 d3\n- (d4=6, d6=4): 5 d3\n- (d4=4, d6=6): 4 d3\n- (d4=2, d6=8): 5 d3\n- (d4=8, d6=8): 4 d3\n\nTotal d3 options across all valid (d4,d6): 5+4+5+4+5+4 = 27\n\nBut we need to multiply by choices for d2, d1, etc.\n\nRecall d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8} — 4 choices.\n\nFor each d2, and for each d3, we need d1 such that $ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $\n\nd1 ∈ {1..9}, so for fixed $ d_2, d_3 $, the required residue of d1 mod 3 is fixed. In 1–9, each residue class appears exactly 3 times:  \n- ≡0: 3,6,9  \n- ≡1: 1,4,7  \n- ≡2: 2,5,8  \n\nSo for any required residue, 3 choices for d1.\n\nSo for each (d2,d3) pair, 3 choices for d1.\n\nNumber of (d2,d3) pairs: d2 has 4 choices, and d3 depends on d4,d6, but we already summed d3 options over valid (d4,d6) as 27. But d2 is independent, so total (d2,d3) combinations = 4 × (average d3 per d4,d6)? No, better: for each of the 6 (d4,d6) pairs, we have some d3 count, and for each, d2 has 4 choices, so total (d2,d3) for those = sum over pairs of (4 × d3_count) = 4 × 27 = 108\n\nThen for each, 3 choices for d1 → 108 × 3 = 324 combinations for (d1,d2,d3,d4,d6)\n\nd5 is fixed = 5.\n\nSo total IDs = 324\n\nBut wait, is that all? Let's verify with the example: 123252\n\nCheck: d1=1, d2=2, d3=3, d4=2, d5=5, d6=2\n\n- d2=2 ∈ {2,4,6,8} ✓  \n- d5=5 ✓  \n- d6=2 ∈ {2,4,6,8} ✓  \n- d4=2, d6=2: 2+2=4 ≡ 1 mod 3? 4 mod 3 = 1 ✓  \n- 2d3 + d4 = 2×3 + 2 = 8 ≡ 0 mod 4 ✓  \n- d1+d2+d3 = 1+2+3 = 6 ≡ 0 mod 3 ✓  \n- First 4 digits: 1232; 32 div by 4? 32/4=8 ✓  \n- First 5: 12325; ends with 5 ✓  \n- Full: 123252; even, sum=1+2+3+2+5+2=15 div by 3 ✓  \n\nSo valid.\n\nNow, our count gave 324. But let's see if we missed constraints.\n\nWe have ensured:\n\n- d1–d6 ∈ 1–9  \n- d2,d6 even  \n- d5=5  \n- d4 ∈ {2,4,6,8} and satisfies d4+d6 ≡1 mod 3  \n- For each such d4, d3 chosen to satisfy 2d3 + d4 ≡0 mod 4  \n- d1 chosen so d1+d2+d3 ≡0 mod 3  \n\nAll conditions satisfied.\n\nSo total = number of (d4,d6) pairs × (d3 options for each) × d2 choices (4) × d1 choices (3) = as computed 6 pairs, with d3 counts [5,4,5,4,5,4], sum 27, times 4 × 3 = 12, so 27 × 12 = 324\n\nThus answer_2 = 324\n\nBut let's double-check count of (d4,d6) pairs:\n\nd6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\n\n- d6=2: d4 ≡2 mod 3 and d4∈{2,4,6,8} → d4=2 (2), d4=8 (8%3=2) → yes, 2 values  \n- d6=4: d4≡0 mod 3 → d4=6 (6%3=0) → 1  \n- d6=6: d4≡1 mod 3 → d4=4 (4%3=1) → 1  \n- d6=8: d4≡2 mod 3 → d4=2,8 → 2  \nTotal 6 — correct.\n\nd3 counts:\n\n- d4=2: 2 mod 4 =2 → need 2d3≡2 mod 4 → d3 odd → {1,3,5,7,9} =5  \n- d4=8: 8 mod 4=0 → need 2d3≡0 mod 4 → d3 even → {2,4,6,8} =4  \n- d4=6: 6 mod 4=2 → same as d4=2 →5  \n- d4=4: 4 mod 4=0 → same as d4=8 →4  \n\nSo pairs:\n\n(d4,d6) = (2,2): d3=5  \n(8,2): d3=4  \n(6,4): d3=5  \n(4,6): d3=4  \n(2,8): d3=5  \n(8,8): d3=4  \n\nSum 5+4+5+4+5+4 = 27 — correct.\n\nThen 27 × 4 (d2) × 3 (d1) = 324\n\nSo answer is 324.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The condition that the distance from start to last house is sqrt(2012) on both days gives |z^{2013} - z| = |z^{2012} - 1| = sqrt(2012). Factoring the left side yields |z| * |z^{2012} - 1| = |z^{2012} - 1|, implying |z| = 1 (since |z^{2012} - 1| = sqrt(2012) ≠ 0). Thus k = |z| - 1 = 0. Problem 2: The six-digit ID must satisfy divisibility rules for lengths 1 through 6, with digits 1-9 only. Key constraints are d5 = 5, d2 and d6 even (2,4,6,8), d4 must be even and satisfy d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3, and 2d3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 4. Counting valid (d4,d6) pairs (6 total) with corresponding d3 options (summing to 27), and for each, 4 choices for d2 and 3 for d1 (to satisfy digit sum mod 3), yields 27 * 4 * 3 = 324 valid IDs.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"324\"\n}",
