Determine the number of ordered pairs of composite positive integers $ (m, n) $ for which $ L(m)L(n) = 80 $. Instead of determining the number of ordered pairs... simply find $ k = N(40) + 0 $, where $ N(d) $ is the number of primes less than or equal to the smallest prime factor of $ d $.\n\nSo despite the long setup about $ L(n) $ and composite pairs, the problem says: *Instead of* doing that complicated counting, just compute $ k = N(40) + 0 $, where $ N(d) $ is the number of primes ≤ smallest prime factor of $ d $.\n\nSo we need:\n\n- Find the smallest prime factor of $ d = 40 $.\n- Count how many primes are ≤ that smallest prime factor.\n- Add 0 → so just that count.\n\nFactor 40:  \n$ 40 = 2^3 \\cdot 5 $, so smallest prime factor is $ 2 $.\n\nPrimes ≤ 2: only prime is $ 2 $. So primes ≤ 2 are: {2} → count = 1.\n\nThus $ N(40) = 1 $, so $ k = 1 + 0 = 1 $.\n\n✅ Answer to Problem 1 is **1**.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\nA square is inscribed in a circle of radius 1. Find the perimeter of the square.\n\nWhen a square is inscribed in a circle, all four vertices lie on the circle. The diagonal of the square equals the diameter of the circle.\n\n- Circle radius = 1 ⇒ diameter = 2 ⇒ diagonal of square = 2.\n\nLet side length of square be $ s $. Then diagonal = $ s\\sqrt{2} $.\n\nSo:\n$$\ns\\sqrt{2} = 2 \\Rightarrow s = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nPerimeter = $ 4s = 4\\sqrt{2} $.\n\n✅ Answer to Problem 2 is $ 4\\sqrt{2} $.\n\n---\n\nNow format final answer in required JSON.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The smallest prime factor of 40 is 2. The primes ≤ 2 are just {2}, so N(40) = 1. Thus k = N(40) + 0 = 1. Problem 2: A square inscribed in a circle of radius 1 has diagonal equal to the circle's diameter, which is 2. Since diagonal = s√2, side s = 2/√2 = √2. Perimeter = 4s = 4√2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4\\\\sqrt{2}\"\n}",
