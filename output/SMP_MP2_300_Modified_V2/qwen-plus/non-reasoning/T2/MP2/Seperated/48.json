  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:  \nWe are told: “Given a set $ A $ with $ n \\geq 1 $ elements, find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $ A $ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell.” But then it says: “Instead of determining the number of partitions… simply find $ k = n + 5 $, where $ n $ is the cardinality of the set $ A $ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell.”\n\nSo we need to find the *smallest possible* (or the only possible) $ n $ such that a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell exists — then compute $ k = n + 5 $.\n\nLet’s unpack terminology.\n\nA “2-configuration” typically refers to a collection of 2-element subsets (i.e., unordered pairs), possibly with some consistency condition. “Order 1” likely means each element appears in exactly 1 pair (i.e., degree 1 in the corresponding graph), and “exactly 1 cell” suggests there is exactly one such pair (i.e., one 2-element subset). So a 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell would be a single unordered pair — i.e., a 2-element subset — and “consistent” and “order 1” would mean that each element in the pair appears exactly once (which is automatic), and no element outside the pair appears — but the configuration is *of the set $ A $*, so all elements of $ A $ must be accounted for? Or does “configuration of $ A $” mean it's built from elements of $ A $, not necessarily covering all?\n\nBut “order 1” often means each element of $ A $ appears in exactly one block (i.e., the configuration is a partition). If there is exactly 1 cell, and each cell is a 2-element subset (since it's a 2-configuration), then the only way for a partition of $ A $ into 2-element subsets with exactly one subset is if $ |A| = 2 $. Because a partition into pairs requires even size, and with exactly one pair → $ n = 2 $.\n\nAlso, “consistent 2-configuration of order 1” — likely means a 1-regular 2-uniform hypergraph on $ A $, i.e., a perfect matching — which for one edge requires exactly 2 vertices.\n\nThus $ n = 2 $ is the only possible size. Then $ k = n + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7 $.\n\nSo answer_1 = 7.\n\nProblem 2:  \nBest-of-9 series: first to 5 wins. So series ends when either team reaches 5 wins. We want probability that **exactly 7 games** are played to determine a winner.\n\nThat means after 6 games, no team has yet reached 5 wins, but after the 7th game, one team reaches exactly 5 wins.\n\nSo after 6 games, one team must have exactly 4 wins, and the other has 2 wins (since 4 + 2 = 6), and then the team with 4 wins wins game 7 → reaches 5.\n\nCould it be 4–2 only? Yes: because if it were 3–3, then after game 7, winner would have 4, not 5 — insufficient. If it were 5–1 or 6–0 after 6 games, series would have ended earlier. So to go to game 7 and end at game 7, the winner must reach their 5th win *on game 7*, meaning they had exactly 4 wins in the first 6 games, and the opponent had exactly 2 wins (since 4 + 2 = 6). (Note: 4 + 1 = 5 → opponent would have 1, but 4+1=5 ≠ 6 games; total games after 6 is 6, so wins must sum to 6.)\n\nSo possibilities:\n\n- Mathletes win in exactly 7 games: they have 4 wins in first 6 games, and win game 7.\n\n- Opponent wins in exactly 7 games: opponent has 4 wins in first 6 games → Mathletes have 2 wins in first 6, and opponent wins game 7.\n\nBut the problem asks: “What is the probability that exactly 7 games will need to be played to determine a winner?” — i.e., regardless of who wins, as long as it ends at game 7.\n\nSo total probability = P(Mathletes win in 7) + P(Opponent wins in 7).\n\nGiven Mathletes win any game independently with probability $ p = \\frac{2}{3} $, opponent wins with $ q = \\frac{1}{3} $.\n\nP(Mathletes win in exactly 7) = P(exactly 4 wins in first 6 games) × P(win game 7)  \n= $ \\binom{6}{4} p^4 q^{2} \\times p = \\binom{6}{4} p^5 q^2 $\n\nSimilarly, P(Opponent wins in exactly 7) = P(opponent has 4 wins in first 6) × P(opponent wins game 7)  \n= $ \\binom{6}{4} q^4 p^{2} \\times q = \\binom{6}{4} q^5 p^2 $\n\nSo total = $ \\binom{6}{4} \\left( p^5 q^2 + q^5 p^2 \\right) $\n\nCompute:\n\n$ \\binom{6}{4} = 15 $\n\n$ p = \\frac{2}{3},\\ q = \\frac{1}{3} $\n\nSo:\n\n$ p^5 q^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2^5}{3^5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^2} = \\frac{32}{3^7} = \\frac{32}{2187} $\n\n$ q^5 p^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^5 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3^5} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3^2} = \\frac{4}{3^7} = \\frac{4}{2187} $\n\nSum = $ \\frac{32 + 4}{2187} = \\frac{36}{2187} $\n\nMultiply by 15: $ 15 \\times \\frac{36}{2187} = \\frac{540}{2187} $\n\nSimplify fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 9:  \n540 ÷ 9 = 60  \n2187 ÷ 9 = 243  \n\nSo $ \\frac{60}{243} $\n\nDivide by 3: 60 ÷ 3 = 20, 243 ÷ 3 = 81 → $ \\frac{20}{81} $\n\nCheck: 2187 = 3^7 = 2187, yes. 540 / 2187 = ?  \n540 ÷ 27 = 20, 2187 ÷ 27 = 81 → yes, since 27×81 = 2187, and 27×20 = 540.\n\nSo simplified: $ \\frac{20}{81} $\n\nThus answer_2 = \"20/81\"\n\nNow format JSON.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: A consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell means a single 2-element subset (a pair) forming a partition of the set A, requiring |A| = 2.
