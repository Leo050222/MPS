She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, but sushi is sticky, and Wendy can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi, assuming that the pieces of sushi are distinguishable? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row.\n\nLet’s parse this carefully.\n\nWe have a $2 \\times 3$ grid:\n\nLabel positions as:\n\n```\nA B C   ← top row\nD E F   ← bottom row\n```\n\nSo:\n- Top row: A (1,1), B (1,2), C (1,3)\n- Bottom row: D (2,1), E (2,2), F (2,3)\n\nAdjacency is orthogonal only (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.\n\nSo adjacency list (undirected graph):\n\n- A adjacent to B and D  \n- B adjacent to A, C, E  \n- C adjacent to B and F  \n- D adjacent to A, E  \n- E adjacent to B, D, F  \n- F adjacent to C and E  \n\nSo degrees in full graph:\n- deg(A) = 2  \n- deg(B) = 3  \n- deg(C) = 2  \n- deg(D) = 2  \n- deg(E) = 3  \n- deg(F) = 2  \n\nNow, the problem says:\n\n> ...find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces **after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row**.\n\nThe two endpoint pieces of the top row are A and C.\n\nSo Wendy eats A and C first — but we don’t care about order yet; just that they’re removed.\n\nSo remaining pieces: B, D, E, F.\n\nInduced subgraph on {B, D, E, F} — i.e., keep only edges between these vertices that existed in original graph.\n\nOriginal edges among these:\n\nRecall full adjacencies:\n\n- B connected to A, C, E → among {B,D,E,F}, only E remains ⇒ B–E edge exists  \n- D connected to A, E ⇒ A is gone, so only D–E remains  \n- E connected to B, D, F ⇒ all three (B, D, F) are present ⇒ E–B, E–D, E–F  \n- F connected to C, E ⇒ C is gone, so only F–E remains  \n\nSo edges in induced subgraph on {B, D, E, F}:\n\n- B–E  \n- D–E  \n- E–F  \n\nThat’s it. No B–D, B–F, D–F.\n\nSo degrees in this induced subgraph:\n\n- deg(B) = 1 (only to E)  \n- deg(D) = 1 (only to E)  \n- deg(E) = 3 (to B, D, F)  \n- deg(F) = 1 (only to E)\n\nThus, $\\deg(F) = 1$, so $k = \\deg(F) + 0 = 1$.\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **1**.\n\nNote: The “sticky” condition (can only eat a piece adjacent to at most two others) seems like a red herring here — because the problem explicitly tells us *not* to count orders, but just compute this degree after removing A and C. So we don’t need to verify whether eating A and C first is allowed under the rule — it's given as the scenario.\n\nAlso, “adjacent to at most two other pieces” likely refers to the number of *uneaten* adjacent pieces at the time of eating — but again, since the problem says “after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row”, and asks for degree of F in the induced subgraph on remaining pieces, it's purely a graph-theoretic degree in the subgraph induced by {B,D,E,F}. So yes, deg(F) = 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers randomly (and independently) chosen from the range $[0,1]$. Find the probability that $a, b$ and 1 form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle.\n\nWe are to find probability that three lengths $a$, $b$, and $1$, with $a,b \\in [0,1]$, form an **obtuse triangle**.\n\nFirst, recall triangle conditions:\n\n- Triangle inequality: sum of any two sides > third.\n\nSince $a,b \\in [0,1]$, and third side is 1, the only nontrivial inequalities are:\n\n- $a + b > 1$ (since $a + 1 > b$ always true because $a \\ge 0$, $b \\le 1$ ⇒ $a+1 \\ge 1 \\ge b$; similarly $b + 1 > a$ always holds). So only constraint for triangle existence is $a + b > 1$.\n\nSo sample space for triangle is region: $a \\in [0,1], b \\in [0,1], a+b > 1$. That’s the upper-right triangle of unit square above line $a+b=1$, area = $1/2$.\n\nBut we want **obtuse** triangle.\n\nRecall: For triangle with sides $x,y,z$, it is obtuse iff the square of one side is **greater than** sum of squares of other two.\n\nSo for sides $a,b,1$, there are three cases:\n\n1. Angle opposite side $a$ is obtuse ⇒ $a^2 > b^2 + 1^2 = b^2 + 1$  \n2. Angle opposite side $b$ is obtuse ⇒ $b^2 > a^2 + 1$  \n3. Angle opposite side $1$ is obtuse ⇒ $1^2 > a^2 + b^2$\n\nBut note: Since $a,b \\in [0,1]$, $a^2 \\le 1$, $b^2 \\le 1$, so:\n\n- $a^2 > b^2 + 1$ ⇒ $a^2 > b^2 + 1 \\ge 1$, so $a^2 > 1$, but $a \\le 1 \\Rightarrow a^2 \\le 1$, equality only at $a = 1$. So $a^2 > b^2 + 1$ impossible unless $b=0$ and $a>1$, which can't happen. So case 1 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, case 2: $b^2 > a^2 + 1$ impossible.\n\nSo only possible obtuse angle is the one opposite side length 1.\n\nThus, triangle is obtuse **iff** $1^2 > a^2 + b^2$, i.e., $a^2 + b^2 < 1$, **and** triangle inequalities hold (i.e., $a + b > 1$).\n\nSo desired region is:\n\n$$\n\\{(a,b) \\in [0,1]^2 \\mid a + b > 1 \\text{ and } a^2 + b^2 < 1\\}\n$$\n\nWe need area of this region.\n\nLet’s sketch or compute.\n\nUnit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\n\n- Line $a + b = 1$: diagonal from (1,0) to (0,1).\n- Circle $a^2 + b^2 = 1$: quarter-circle in first quadrant, radius 1, centered at origin; intersects square at (1,0) and (0,1), and bulges out — but within square, it’s the arc from (1,0) to (0,1) passing through $(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) \\approx (0.707, 0.707)$.\n\nRegion $a^2 + b^2 < 1$ is interior of quarter circle.\n\nRegion $a + b > 1$ is above the diagonal.\n\nSo intersection is the part of the quarter-disk that lies above the line $a + b = 1$.\n\nSo geometrically: in unit square, quarter circle radius 1, and line from (1,0) to (0,1). They intersect at (1,0) and (0,1), and the line cuts the quarter disk into two parts: a smaller segment near the corner (0,0) — but wait: actually, the line $a+b=1$ goes from (1,0) to (0,1), same endpoints as the quarter circle arc. So the region $a^2 + b^2 < 1$ and $a + b > 1$ is the region *inside the circle* and *above the line*, i.e., a circular segment.\n\nYes — exactly the segment of the quarter disk cut off by chord from (1,0) to (0,1).\n\nSo area = area of sector minus area of triangle formed by center (0,0) and points (1,0), (0,1).\n\n- Sector: angle between vectors (1,0) and (0,1) is $\\pi/2$ radians (90°), radius 1 ⇒ area = $\\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1^2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$\n\n- Triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (0,1): right triangle, legs 1, area = $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo area of segment (the part of sector *above* the chord) = sector − triangle = $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nBut wait: is that the region where $a+b > 1$? Let's verify.\n\nThe chord from (1,0) to (0,1) is the line $a+b=1$. The center (0,0) is *below* the chord (since 0+0 = 0 < 1). So the triangle (0,0),(1,0),(0,1) is the region *below* the chord (i.e., $a+b \\le 1$) inside the sector.\n\nTherefore, the part of the sector *above* the chord is indeed sector minus that triangle: $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nAnd that region satisfies both:\n\n- $a^2 + b^2 < 1$ (inside circle)\n- $a + b > 1$ (above chord)\n\nAlso, since $a,b \\in [0,1]$, and the quarter circle lies entirely within $[0,1]^2$, no further restriction.\n\nSo desired area = $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nTotal sample space is unit square area = 1, and $a,b$ are chosen uniformly from $[0,1]^2$, so probability = $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSimplify: $\\frac{\\pi - 2}{4}$\n\nSo answer is $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{1}{2}$, or equivalently $\\frac{\\pi - 2}{4}$\n\nEither is exact. Usually written as $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nLet’s confirm numerically: $\\pi/4 \\approx 0.7854$, minus 0.5 = 0.2854\n\nDoes that make sense? Area above diagonal in unit square is 0.5; portion of that inside circle should be less than half — yes, ~0.285 seems reasonable.\n\nAlternative derivation: integrate.\n\nWe can compute:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\int_{a=0}^{1} \\int_{b = \\max(1-a, 0)}^{\\sqrt{1 - a^2}} db\\, da\n$$\n\nBut need to find limits where upper limit $\\sqrt{1 - a^2} > \\max(1-a, 0)$\n\nFind where $ \\sqrt{1 - a^2} = 1 - a $\n\nSquare both sides: $1 - a^2 = 1 - 2a + a^2 \\Rightarrow -a^2 = -2a + a^2 \\Rightarrow 0 = -2a + 2a^2 \\Rightarrow 2a(a - 1) = 0 \\Rightarrow a = 0$ or $a = 1$\n\nSo curves meet only at endpoints. And for $a \\in (0,1)$, which is larger? At $a = 0.5$: $\\sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \\sqrt{0.75} \\approx 0.866$, $1 - 0.5 = 0.5$, so sqrt > 1−a. So for all $a \\in (0,1)$, $\\sqrt{1 - a^2} > 1 - a$, so upper limit is $\\sqrt{1 - a^2}$, lower is $1 - a$, provided $1 - a \\ge 0$ ⇒ $a \\le 1$, ok.\n\nBut also need $\\sqrt{1 - a^2} \\le 1$, always true.\n\nHowever, when does $1 - a \\le \\sqrt{1 - a^2}$? As above, always in [0,1].\n\nBut also need $1 - a \\ge 0$ ⇒ $a \\le 1$, fine.\n\nBut for $a$ such that $\\sqrt{1 - a^2} < 0$? Never.\n\nSo integral becomes:\n\n$$\n\\int_{a=0}^{1} \\left[ \\sqrt{1 - a^2} - (1 - a) \\right] da = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{1 - a^2}\\, da - \\int_0^1 (1 - a)\\, da\n$$\n\n- $\\int_0^1 \\sqrt{1 - a^2}\\, da$ = area of quarter circle = $\\pi/4$\n\n- $\\int_0^1 (1 - a)\\, da = [a - a^2/2]_0^1 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2$\n\nSo same result: $\\pi/4 - 1/2$\n\n✅ Confirmed.\n\nSo answer to Problem 2 is $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n- Problem 1: 1  \n- Problem 2: $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nIn JSON format as requested.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The 2×3 grid is labeled A B C (top row) and D E F (bottom row).
