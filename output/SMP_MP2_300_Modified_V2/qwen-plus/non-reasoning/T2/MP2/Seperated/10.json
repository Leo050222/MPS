  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve each step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> You are given a $10 \\times 2$ grid of unit squares. Two different squares are adjacent if they share a side. How many ways can one mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent? Instead of counting the total number of ways to mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent, simply find $e = w + 2019$, where $w$ is the number of ways to mark one square in each of nine consecutive rows such that no two marked squares in adjacent rows share the same column.\n\nSo we’re not asked to count all valid 9-markings with no adjacency — only a *restricted* version: mark **exactly one square per row**, for **nine consecutive rows**, and in **adjacent rows**, the marked squares must be in **different columns** (i.e., cannot both be in column 1 or both in column 2). Since it's a $10 \\times 2$ grid, rows are numbered 1 through 10, columns are 1 and 2.\n\nSo “nine consecutive rows” means rows $r, r+1, ..., r+8$, where $r$ can be 1 or 2 (since 10 − 9 + 1 = 2 possible starting rows: rows 1–9 or rows 2–10).\n\nFor each such block of 9 rows, we want to count the number of ways to choose one square per row (so column 1 or 2), such that **no two adjacent rows have the same column**.\n\nThat is: a sequence of length 9 over alphabet {1,2}, with no two consecutive entries equal.\n\nThis is a classic recurrence: number of binary strings of length $k$ with no two consecutive equal digits.\n\nLet’s define $a_k$: number of length-$k$ sequences over {1,2} with no two consecutive equal symbols.\n\n- For $k = 1$: 2 options → $a_1 = 2$\n- For $k = 2$: 12, 21 → 2 options → $a_2 = 2$\n- In general: first symbol: 2 choices; each subsequent symbol must differ from previous ⇒ 1 choice ⇒ So for $k \\ge 1$, $a_k = 2 \\cdot 1^{k-1} = 2$\n\nWait — is that right?\n\nYes! Because once you pick the first column (2 choices), each next row must pick the *other* column — forced. So for length $k$, there are exactly **2** such sequences: alternating starting with column 1 or column 2.\n\nE.g., for k=3: 121, 212 → only 2.\n\nSo for any fixed block of 9 consecutive rows, number of valid markings = 2.\n\nThere are **2** such blocks: rows 1–9 and rows 2–10.\n\nSo total $w = 2 \\text{ (blocks)} \\times 2 \\text{ (patterns per block)} = 4$\n\nWait — but hold on: Are the blocks disjoint? Yes, but the problem says:\n\n> \"the number of ways to mark one square in each of nine consecutive rows such that no two marked squares in adjacent rows share the same column.\"\n\nIt doesn’t say “for some choice of nine consecutive rows”, but rather count *all* such markings across *all possible* nine-consecutive-row selections.\n\nSo yes: for each possible set of 9 consecutive rows (there are 2 such sets), and for each such set, count number of column assignments (1 per row) with alternating columns → 2 per set.\n\nSo $w = 2 \\times 2 = 4$\n\nThus $e = w + 2019 = 4 + 2019 = 2023$\n\nBut wait — double-check: Is there any overcount? For example, is there a marking that appears in both blocks? That is, a marking covering rows 1–9 and also rows 2–10? That would require a marking on rows 1–10 with alternating columns — but the problem only asks for markings on *nine consecutive rows*, not on the full 10. Each marking is defined on a specific set of 9 rows. So even if a longer pattern exists, each 9-row segment is considered separately. So no overcount — they are distinct configurations because they occupy different sets of rows.\n\nHence $w = 4$, $e = 2023$\n\n✅ So answer_1 = 2023\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are positive integers with $m < n$ such that the interval $[m, n)$ contains more multiples of 2021 than multiples of 2000. Compute the maximum possible value of $n - m$.\n\nNote: $[m, n)$ means integers $x$ such that $m \\le x < n$, i.e., integer count = $n - m$. We want to maximize $L = n - m$, subject to:\n\n$$\n\\#\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z} : m \\le x < n,\\ 2021 \\mid x\\} > \\#\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z} : m \\le x < n,\\ 2000 \\mid x\\}\n$$\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- $A(L, m) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2021} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m-1}{2021} \\right\\rfloor$ = number of multiples of 2021 in $[m,n)$\n- $B(L, m) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2000} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m-1}{2000} \\right\\rfloor$ = number of multiples of 2000 in $[m,n)$\n\nWe need $A > B$, and maximize $L = n - m$.\n\nObservation: The densities are $1/2021 \\approx 0.0004948$ and $1/2000 = 0.0005$. So 2000 has slightly higher density ⇒ over large intervals, there will be more multiples of 2000. To get *more* multiples of 2021, we need to carefully choose an interval that catches many 2021-multiples and avoids 2000-multiples.\n\nSince 2021 and 2000 are coprime? Let's check:\n\n- 2000 = $2^4 \\cdot 5^3$\n- 2021 = ? Let's factor: 2021 ÷ 43 = 47? 43×47 = 2021? 43×47 = (45−2)(45+2) = 45² − 4 = 2025 − 4 = 2021. Yes! So 2021 = 43 × 47, both primes, neither divides 2000 ⇒ gcd(2000,2021)=1.\n\nSo the combined period is 2000×2021 = let's compute: 2000×2021 = 2000×(2000 + 21) = 2000² + 2000×21 = 4,000,000 + 42,000 = 4,042,000.\n\nOver one full period, number of multiples of 2021 is exactly 2000, and of 2000 is exactly 2021 ⇒ so over full period, multiples of 2000 outnumber those of 2021 by 21.\n\nSo to get more 2021s than 2000s, interval must be *less than full period*, and positioned to include as many 2021-multiples and as few 2000-multiples as possible.\n\nWe want to maximize $L = n - m$, so consider the largest possible $L$ such that there exists some $m$ with $A - B \\ge 1$.\n\nLet’s define the difference function:\n\n$$\nD(m, n) = A(m,n) - B(m,n) = \\left( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2021} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m-1}{2021} \\right\\rfloor \\right) - \\left( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2000} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m-1}{2000} \\right\\rfloor \\right)\n$$\n\nLet $x = m-1$, $y = n-1$, so $y \\ge x \\ge 0$, and $L = n - m = y - x$.\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nD = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{y}{2021} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2021} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{y}{2000} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2000} \\right\\rfloor\n$$\n\nWe want $D \\ge 1$, maximize $y - x$.\n\nIdea: To maximize length while keeping difference ≥ 1, consider placing interval just after a multiple of 2000 and ending just before the next one, while including many 2021-multiples.\n\nAlternate approach: Consider the fractional parts.\n\nLet’s define for real $t$: $f(t) = \\lfloor t / 2021 \\rfloor - \\lfloor t / 2000 \\rfloor$. Then $D = f(y) - f(x)$.\n\nSince $1/2021 < 1/2000$, $f(t)$ is generally decreasing, but stepwise.\n\nThe maximum possible $y - x$ such that $f(y) - f(x) \\ge 1$ occurs when $f$ drops by at most 0 over most of interval, then jumps up? Wait no — $f(t)$ increases by 1 at each multiple of 2021, decreases by 1 at each multiple of 2000? No: $\\lfloor t/a \\rfloor$ increases by 1 at multiples of $a$. So:\n\n- At each multiple of 2021, $f(t)$ increases by 1.\n- At each multiple of 2000, $f(t)$ decreases by 1.\n\nSo net change over interval is (# of 2021-multiples) − (# of 2000-multiples) in $(x, y]$? Actually, since floor jumps at integer points, and we use $\\lfloor y/a \\rfloor - \\lfloor x/a \\rfloor$, it counts multiples in $(x, y]$, i.e., $a \\mid k$ and $x < k \\le y$. But our original count was $m \\le x < n$, i.e., $x$ from $m$ to $n-1$, inclusive ⇒ integers $k$ with $m \\le k \\le n-1$, i.e., $k \\in [m, n-1]$, which is same as $k \\in [x+1, y]$, since $x = m-1$, $y = n-1$. So yes, $k \\in (x, y]$. So $A = \\#\\{k \\in (x,y] : 2021 \\mid k\\}$, same for B.\n\nSo $D = \\#2021\\text{-mults in }(x,y] - \\#2000\\text{-mults in }(x,y]$\n\nWe want this ≥ 1, maximize $y - x$.\n\nSo we want longest interval $(x, y]$ containing at least one more multiple of 2021 than of 2000.\n\nSince densities differ by tiny amount, the maximal such interval should be just less than the distance between two consecutive points where the cumulative counts cross.\n\nThis is similar to “discrepancy” problem.\n\nLet’s consider the sequence of all multiples of 2000 and 2021 sorted. Each time we pass a multiple of 2021, D increases by 1; each time we pass a multiple of 2000, D decreases by 1.\n\nStart from some $x$, D = 0. As we increase $y$, D changes at each multiple.\n\nWe want the longest interval where net change ≥ 1.\n\nEquivalently: find maximum gap between a point where D = 0 and next point where D = 1, staying ≥ 1 throughout? Not quite.\n\nBetter: We want max $y - x$ such that D(x,y) ≥ 1.\n\nThis is equivalent to: what’s the maximum distance between a 2021-multiple and the *previous* 2000-multiple, such that in between there are no 2000-multiples but at least one 2021-multiple? Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: To maximize length with more 2021s than 2000s, best is to take interval that contains *one* multiple of 2021 and *zero* multiples of 2000. Then D = 1 − 0 = 1, acceptable. What's the longest interval containing exactly one 2021-multiple and no 2000-multiple?\n\nThat would be from just after a 2000-multiple to just before the next 2000-multiple, and aligned to include one 2021-multiple.\n\nThe maximum possible length of an interval containing no multiple of 2000 is 1999 (e.g., between two consecutive multiples: $[2000k + 1, 2000(k+1) - 1]$, length 1999). Within that, can we fit at least one multiple of 2021? Yes, if 2021 ≤ 1999? No, 2021 > 1999. So an interval of length 1999 cannot contain a full 2021-skip — but it can contain at most one multiple of 2021, since 2021 > 1999 ⇒ spacing larger than interval length ⇒ at most one.\n\nBut can an interval of length 1999 contain a multiple of 2021? Only if the interval covers some 2021k. Since 2021 > 1999, the gap between consecutive 2021-multiples is 2021, so to contain one, the interval must \"catch\" it — possible.\n\nBut length 1999 is too small to guarantee — but we want *maximum possible* $L$, so perhaps larger than 1999? But if interval length ≥ 2000, it must contain at least one multiple of 2000 (by pigeonhole: any 2000 consecutive integers contain exactly one multiple of 2000). So if $L \\ge 2000$, then $B \\ge 1$. To have $A > B$, need $A \\ge 2$. So need at least two multiples of 2021.\n\nSimilarly, if $L \\ge 4042$, then at least two multiples of 2021 (since 2×2021 = 4042), etc.\n\nGeneral fact: In any interval of length $L$, number of multiples of $d$ is either $\\lfloor L/d \\rfloor$ or $\\lceil L/d \\rceil$, depending on alignment.\n\nSpecifically:\n- Max number of multiples of $d$ in interval of length $L$ is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{L + d - 1}{d} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{L-1}{d} \\right\\rfloor + 1$\n- Min is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{L}{d} \\right\\rfloor$\n\nBut we need $A > B$, i.e.,\n\n$$\nA \\ge B + 1\n$$\n\nLet $A_{\\max}(L)$ = max possible $A$ for length $L$ = $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{L + 2021 - 1}{2021} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{L + 2020}{2021} \\right\\rfloor$\n\nSimilarly, $B_{\\min}(L)$ = min possible $B$ = $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{L}{2000} \\right\\rfloor$\n\nSo sufficient condition for existence: $A_{\\max}(L) > B_{\\min}(L)$\n\nWe want largest $L$ such that there exists alignment with $A > B$. Necessary and sufficient is that $A_{\\max}(L) \\ge B_{\\min}(L) + 1$\n\nSo solve:\n\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{L + 2020}{2021} \\right\\rfloor \\ge \\left\\lfloor \\frac{L}{2000} \\right\\rfloor + 1\n$$\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nLet $a = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{L}{2000} \\right\\rfloor$, so $a \\le L/2000 < a+1$, i.e., $2000a \\le L < 2000(a+1)$\n\nThen RHS = $a + 1$\n\nLHS = $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{L + 2020}{2021} \\right\\rfloor \\ge a + 1$\n\nSo need $\\frac{L + 2020}{2021} \\ge a + 1$, i.e., $L \\ge 2021(a + 1) - 2020 = 2021a + 2021 - 2020 = 2021a + 1$\n\nSo need:\n\n$$\n2021a + 1 \\le L < 2000(a + 1)\n$$\n\nSo for given $a$, feasible $L$ exists iff:\n\n$$\n2021a + 1 < 2000(a + 1)\n$$\n\nBecause upper bound must exceed lower bound.\n\nCompute:\n\n$2021a + 1 < 2000a + 2000$\n\n⇒ $21a < 1999$\n\n⇒ $a < 1999 / 21 = 95.190...$, so $a \\le 95$\n\nSo max $a = 95$\n\nThen lower bound: $L \\ge 2021×95 + 1$\n\nCompute 2021×95:\n\n2021 × 100 = 202100  \n2021 × 5 = 10105  \nSo 2021 × 95 = 202100 − 10105 = 191995\n\nThen +1 = 191996\n\nUpper bound: $L < 2000×(95 + 1) = 2000×96 = 192000$\n\nSo $L$ can be from 191996 to 191999 inclusive.\n\nThus maximum possible $L = 191999$\n\nCheck if $L = 191999$ works.\n\nThen $a = \\lfloor 191999 / 2000 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 95.9995 \\rfloor = 95$\n\nSo min $B = 95$\n\nMax $A = \\lfloor (191999 + 2020)/2021 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 194019 / 2021 \\rfloor$\n\nCompute 2021 × 96 = 2021 × 100 − 2021 × 4 = 202100 − 8084 = 194016\n\n194019 − 194016 = 3, so floor = 96\n\nSo $A_{\\max} = 96$, $B_{\\min} = 95$, so $A_{\\max} = B_{\\min} + 1$, so possible to have $A = 96$, $B = 95$, thus $A > B$.\n\nCan we achieve this? Yes, by aligning interval to start right after a multiple of 2000, and end right before the next, to minimize $B$, and position to catch extra 2021-multiple.\n\nSpecifically, set $m = 2000k + 1$, $n = m + L = 2000k + 1 + 191999 = 2000k + 192000 = 2000(k + 96)$\n\nSo $[m,n) = [2000k + 1, 2000(k + 96))$, which contains *no* multiple of 2000? Wait, multiples of 2000 in this interval: 2000(k+1), 2000(k+2), ..., 2000(k+95) — that's 95 multiples. Since interval is from $2000k + 1$ to $2000k + 192000$, exclusive of upper bound, so includes integers up to $2000k + 191999$. The largest multiple of 2000 ≤ that is $2000k + 192000 - 2000 = 2000(k + 95) = 2000k + 190000$. So multiples are $2000(k+1)$ up to $2000(k+95)$: that's 95 multiples. So $B = 95$, matches $B_{\\min} = \\lfloor L/2000 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 191999/2000 \\rfloor = 95$. Good.\n\nNow $A$: number of multiples of 2021 in $[2000k + 1, 2000k + 192000)$. Length 191999.\n\nMax possible is 96, as computed. Can we choose $k$ so that there are 96 multiples? Since the average spacing is 2021, over length ~192000, expected ~192000/2021 ≈ 95.0? Wait 192000 / 2021 ≈ let's compute: 2021 × 95 = 191995, as before. So 192000 − 191995 = 5, so 95 full gaps cover 191995, so 96th multiple is 5 more. So in any interval of length 192000, you can fit 96 multiples if aligned to start at a multiple.\n\nBut our interval length is 191999, just one less. So if we take interval of length 191999 that starts at a multiple of 2021, then it includes multiples at positions 0, 2021, ..., up to largest ≤ 191999. Since 2021 × 95 = 191995, so multiples at 0, 2021, ..., 191995 → that's 96 multiples (indices 0 to 95 inclusive). So interval $[0, 191999]$ contains multiples $0, 2021, ..., 191995$: yes, 96 numbers.\n\nBut our interval must be $[m, n)$ with $m,n$ positive integers, and avoid multiples of 2000. If we set $m = 1$, $n = 192000$, then $[1, 192000)$ includes multiples of 2000: 2000, 4000, ..., 192000? 192000 is excluded, so up to 190000 = 2000×95, so 95 multiples — ok. And multiples of 2021 from 2021 up to largest ≤ 191999. 2021×94 = 2021×90 + 2021×4 = 181890 + 8084 = 189974; 2021×95 = 191995; 2021×96 = 194016 > 191999, so multiples: 2021, 4042, ..., 191995 → how many? From 1 to 95: 95 multiples? Wait index: first is 2021×1, last is 2021×95 = 191995, so 95 multiples.\n\nBut earlier we said $A_{\\max} = \\lfloor (L + 2020)/2021 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 191999 + 2020 = 194019 / 2021 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 96.001... \\rfloor = 96$. How to get 96? That requires including 2021×0 = 0, but 0 is not in $[1, 192000)$. So if we shift to include 0, but $m$ must be positive integer, so $m \\ge 1$, so 0 excluded.\n\nThus actual max $A$ for $m \\ge 1$ is 95? But wait, 2021×95 = 191995, which is in $[1, 192000)$, and 2021×1 = 2021, so indices 1 through 95: 95 multiples.\n\nBut formula $\\lfloor (n-1)/2021 \\rfloor - \\lfloor (m-1)/2021 \\rfloor$, with $m=1$, $n=192000$, so $n-1 = 191999$, $m-1 = 0$, so $A = \\lfloor 191999/2021 \\rfloor - \\lfloor 0/2021 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 95.0... \\rfloor = 95$, since 2021×95 = 191995 ≤ 191999, and 2021×96 = 194016 > 191999.\n\nSo $A = 95$, $B = \\lfloor 191999/2000 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 95.9995 \\rfloor = 95$, so $A = B$, not greater.\n\nTo get $A > B$, need $A = 96$, $B = 95$, so need $\\lfloor (n-1)/2021 \\rfloor - \\lfloor (m-1)/2021 \\rfloor = 96$, and $\\lfloor (n-1)/2000 \\rfloor - \\lfloor (m-1)/2000 \\rfloor = 95$\n\nSo need the count of 2021-multiples to be 96, 2000-multiples to be 95.\n\nSince 2021-multiples are spaced 2021 apart, to get 96 of them, the interval length must be at least 2021×95 = 191995 (from first to last), plus room to include both ends.\n\nMinimal length to include 96 multiples is from $2021a$ to $2021(a+95)$ inclusive, length = $2021×95 = 191995$, but that's distance between first and last; number of integers from $x$ to $y$ inclusive is $y - x + 1$, so to include $k$ multiples, minimal length is $2021(k-1) + 1$.\n\nFor k=96, minimal length = 2021×95 + 1 = 191995 + 1 = 191996.\n\nSimilarly, to include only 95 multiples of 2000, maximal length without 96th is less than 2000×96 = 192000, so length ≤ 191999.\n\nSo interval length $L$ must satisfy:\n\n- $L \\ge 191996$ to fit 96 multiples of 2021\n- $L \\le 191999$ to fit at most 95 multiples of 2000\n\nSo $L \\in \\{191996, 191997, 191998, 191999\\}$\n\nNow, can we achieve $A = 96$, $B = 95$ for $L = 191999$?\n\nThat requires that in some interval of length 191999, there are 96 multiples of 2021 and 95 of 2000.\n\nSince 2021 and 2000 are coprime, by Chinese remainder theorem, there exists some integer $x$ such that $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2021}$ and $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2000}$, i.e., $x$ is a multiple of 2021, and $x-1$ is multiple of 2000. Then interval $[x - 191995, x]$ has length 191996, contains multiples $x - 2021×95, x - 2021×94, ..., x$, i.e., 96 multiples.\n\nBut we need length 191999.\n\nSet interval $[a, b)$ with $b - a = L$, containing multiples $2021k, 2021(k+1), ..., 2021(k+95)$ — that's 96 multiples, spanning from $2021k$ to $2021(k+95) = 2021k + 191995$. So to include all, need $a \\le 2021k$ and $b > 2021k + 191995$. So $b - a > 191995$, so $L \\ge 191996$.\n\nTo avoid extra 2000-multiple, ensure only 95 of them.\n\nThe 95 multiples of 2000 would be, say, $2000m, 2000(m+1), ..., 2000(m+94)$, spanning $2000m$ to $2000(m+94) = 2000m + 188000$. To fit in length $L$, need $L > 188000$, which is true.\n\nBut to have exactly 95, the interval must contain $2000m$ to $2000(m+94)$, but not $2000(m-1)$ or $2000(m+95)$. So length must be less than distance to next, i.e., $L < 2000×96 = 192000$, as before.\n\nSo for $L = 191999$, it's possible if we can align so that the 96th 2021-multiple is included and the 96th 2000-multiple is excluded.\n\nSince 2021×95 = 191995, and 2000×96 = 192000, difference is 5. So if we take interval of length 191999 ending just before a 2000-multiple, and starting at a 2021-multiple, it might work.\n\nSpecifically, suppose we want interval $[s, s + L)$ with $L = 191999$, containing 2021-multiples $t, t+2021, ..., t+191995$, so $s \\le t$, $s + L > t + 191995$, so $s > t + 191995 - L = t + 191995 - 191999 = t - 4$. So $s > t - 4$, and $s \\le t$, so $s \\in \\{t-3, t-2, t-1, t\\}$.\n\nSimilarly, to avoid 96th 2000-multiple, suppose the 2000-multiples in interval are $u, u+2000, ..., u+188000 = u + 2000×94$, so last is $u + 188000$, and we need $s + L \\le u + 192000 - 1 = u + 191999$, and $s > u - 1$.\n\nBut perhaps simplest: known result in such problems is that the maximum $n - m$ is $2021 \\times 2000 - 2021 - 2000 = \\text{lcm} - 2021 - 2000$, but lcm is product since coprime: $2021×2000 - 2021 - 2000 = 2021×2000 - 4021$\n\nCompute: 2021×2000 = 4,042,000; minus 4021 = 4,037,979 — too big, not matching.\n\nWait, recall classic problem: maximum gap between points where #A > #B for two arithmetic progressions.\n\nActually, standard result: for two moduli $a < b$, coprime, the maximum length of interval with more multiples of $b$ than $a$ is $ab - a - b$. But here we want more of larger modulus (2021 > 2000), so perhaps $ab - a - b = 2021×2000 - 2021 - 2000 = 4,042,000 - 4021 = 4,037,979$. But that seems way too large, and contradicts earlier density argument.\n\nBut wait, in our case, 2021 > 2000, so its multiples are sparser, so to have more of them, need very special alignment, and the longest possible interval is indeed related to Frobenius coin problem.\n\nFrobenius number for two coprime integers $a,b$ is $ab - a - b$, the largest integer not expressible as $ax + by$ for nonnegative integers $x,y$.\n\nBut not directly applicable.\n\nLet’s search for known similar problem: \"largest interval with more multiples of p than q\".\n\nI recall that the maximum possible difference $A - B$ over interval of length $L$ is roughly $L(1/2021 - 1/2000) = L(-21)/(2021×2000)$, negative, so to get positive difference, $L$ must be small.\n\nBut we got $L = 191999$ earlier, and it fits the inequality.\n\nMoreover, in contest problems, this type often has answer $2021 \\times 95 = 191995$, but we need $A > B$, and with $L = 191995$, $A_{\\max} = \\lfloor (191995 + 2020)/2021 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 194015/2021 \\rfloor = 96? 2021×96 = 194016, so 194015/2021 = 95.9995, floor 95. So $A_{\\max} = 95$, $B_{\\min} = \\lfloor 191995/2000 \\rfloor = 95$, so still tie.\n\nAt $L = 191996$: $A_{\\max} = \\lfloor (191996 + 2020)/2021 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 194016/2021 \\rfloor = 96$, $B_{\\min} = \\lfloor 191996/2000 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 95.998 \\rfloor = 95$, so possible.\n\nThus minimal $L$ for possibility is 191996, maximal is 191999.\n\nSo answer is 191999.\n\nConfirm with small analogy: suppose instead of 2021 and 2000, use 3 and 2. Want interval with more multiples of 3 than of 2.\n\nMultiples of 3: 3,6,9,12,...; of 2: 2,4,6,8,...\n\nIn [1,5): numbers 1,2,3,4 → multiples: 3 (one of 3), 2,4 (two of 2) → not good.\n\n[3,6): 3,4,5 → one multiple of 3 (3), none of 2? 4 is in, so one. Tie.\n\n[3,7): 3,4,5,6 → multiples: 3,6 (two of 3), 4,6 (two of 2) → tie.\n\n[1,7): 1-6 → 3,6 (two 3s), 2,4,6 (three 2s).\n\nTry [7,13): 7-12 → multiples of 3: 9,12 (two), of 2: 8,10,12 (three).\n\nHard to get more 3s than 2s. Max interval? Perhaps [9,10): just {9}, one 3, zero 2s → length 1. Or [9,12): 9,10,11 → one 3 (9), one 2 (10) → tie. [9,13): 9,10,11,12 → two 3s, two 2s.\n\nSo for small numbers, max L is small. But for large coprime numbers, the max L is indeed $ab - a - b$? For a=2,b=3, ab-a-b=6-2-3=1, and indeed max L=1 works ([3,4) has one multiple of 3, zero of 2). So perhaps general answer is $2021 \\times 2000 - 2021 - 2000 = 4,042,000 - 4021 = 4,037,979$.\n\nBut that contradicts density: over 4 million, expected multiples of 2021: ~2000, of 2000: ~2021, so B > A.\n\nWait no: in interval of length L, expected A ≈ L/2021, B ≈ L/2000, so A - B ≈ L(1/2021 - 1/2000) = L(-21)/(2021×2000) < 0, so for large L, always B > A. So maximum L is bounded, and our earlier calculation giving ~192000 seems plausible.\n\nIn fact, the critical point is when the cumulative counts cross. The maximum run where A > B is up to just before the next 2000-multiple after a cluster of 2021-multiples.\n\nGiven that 2021 and 2000 differ by 21, and 2000×96 = 192000, 2021×95 = 191995, difference 5, so the longest interval avoiding the 96th 2000-multiple while including the 96th 2021-multiple is 191999.\n\nThus answer_2 = 191999\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n- Problem 1: $e = 2023$\n- Problem 2: $n - m = 191999$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We need w = number of ways to mark one square in each of nine consecutive rows (rows 1-9 or 2-10) such that no two adjacent rows have the same column. For each block of 9 rows, there are exactly 2 alternating patterns (starting with column 1 or 2), so w = 2 blocks × 2 patterns = 4. Thus e = w + 2019 = 4 + 2019 = 2023. Problem 2: To maximize n−m such that [m,n) contains more multiples of 2021 than of 2000, note that multiples of 2000 occur every 2000, multiples of 2021 every 2021. Since gcd(2000,2021)=1, the maximum interval length achieving one more multiple of 2021 than 2000 is bounded by the requirement that the interval can contain at most 95 multiples of 2000 (so length < 192000) and at least 96 multiples of 2021 (requiring length ≥ 2021×95 = 191995, and to fit 96 multiples, minimal length is 191996).
