  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1: We are told to compute $ k = \\binom{5}{2} + 80 $.  \nFirst, compute $ \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2 \\cdot 1} = 10 $.  \nThen $ k = 10 + 80 = 90 $.  \nSo answer_1 = 90.\n\nProblem 2: Triangle ABC has side lengths AB = 21, BC = 55, CA = 56.  \nWe are to find the distance between the two points P such that:\n- ∠BAP = ∠CAP → i.e., P lies on the angle bisector of ∠BAC (internal or external? Note: angle equality suggests AP is the internal or external angle bisector — but since it's ∠BAP = ∠CAP, and A is the vertex, this means ray AP bisects ∠BAC; however, P can be anywhere in the plane, not necessarily inside triangle — so both internal and external bisectors are possible).\n- ∠BPC = 90° → i.e., P lies on the circle with diameter BC (Thales’ theorem: locus of points P such that ∠BPC = 90° is the circle with diameter BC, excluding B and C).\n\nSo we need intersection points of:\n- The (two) angle bisectors of ∠BAC: internal and external bisectors — they are perpendicular lines through A.\n- The circle with diameter BC.\n\nThus there are potentially up to 4 intersections, but only those satisfying ∠BAP = ∠CAP (i.e., lying on either the internal or external bisector) and ∠BPC = 90°.\n\nBut the problem says “there are two points P in the plane…”, and asks for the distance between them.\n\nSo likely: the internal and external angle bisectors of ∠A intersect the circle with diameter BC at exactly one point each (or two total), and those are the two points.\n\nLet’s formalize.\n\nLet’s place coordinates to compute.\n\nPlace points to simplify:\n\nLet’s put B and C on x-axis, since BC is a side and the circle with diameter BC is easy then.\n\nLet B = (0, 0), C = (55, 0), so BC = 55.\n\nThen circle with diameter BC has center at midpoint M = (27.5, 0), radius = 55/2 = 27.5. Equation:  \n$ (x - 27.5)^2 + y^2 = (27.5)^2 $.\n\nNow locate A such that AB = 21, AC = 56.\n\nLet A = (x, y). Then:\n\nAB² = x² + y² = 21² = 441  \nAC² = (x − 55)² + y² = 56² = 3136\n\nSubtract first from second:\n\n(x − 55)² + y² − (x² + y²) = 3136 − 441 = 2695  \nExpand: x² − 110x + 3025 − x² = 2695  \n→ −110x + 3025 = 2695  \n→ −110x = 2695 − 3025 = −330  \n→ x = (−330)/(−110) = 3\n\nThen from x² + y² = 441 → 9 + y² = 441 → y² = 432 → y = ±√432 = ±√(144×3) = ±12√3\n\nSo A is at (3, 12√3) or (3, −12√3). Since triangle orientation doesn’t matter, pick upper half: A = (3, 12√3)\n\nSo now we have:\n\n- A = (3, 12√3)\n- B = (0, 0)\n- C = (55, 0)\n\nWe need points P such that:\n- ∠BAP = ∠CAP ⇒ AP is angle bisector of ∠BAC ⇒ P lies on internal or external angle bisector line through A.\n- ∠BPC = 90° ⇒ P lies on circle with diameter BC: center O = (27.5, 0), radius R = 27.5.\n\nSo find intersection of angle bisectors (two lines through A) with that circle → two points P₁, P₂ → find distance between them.\n\nSo first find equations of internal and external angle bisectors at A.\n\nRecall: Angle bisector theorem in vector form — direction vector of internal bisector is unit vector along AB + unit vector along AC.\n\nLet’s compute vectors:\n\nAB = B − A = (0 − 3, 0 − 12√3) = (−3, −12√3)  \nAC = C − A = (55 − 3, 0 − 12√3) = (52, −12√3)\n\nCompute magnitudes:\n\n|AB| = 21 (given)  \n|AC| = 56 (given)\n\nSo unit vectors:\n\nu_AB = AB / |AB| = (−3/21, −12√3/21) = (−1/7, −4√3/7)  \nu_AC = AC / |AC| = (52/56, −12√3/56) = (13/14, −3√3/14)\n\nNow internal bisector direction vector = u_AB + u_AC:\n\nCompute:\n\nx-component: −1/7 + 13/14 = (−2 + 13)/14 = 11/14  \ny-component: −4√3/7 + (−3√3/14) = (−8√3 − 3√3)/14 = −11√3/14\n\nSo direction vector for internal bisector: (11/14, −11√3/14) = (11/14)(1, −√3)\n\nSo slope = (−√3)/1 = −√3\n\nThus internal bisector line through A = (3, 12√3) with slope −√3:\n\nEquation: y − 12√3 = −√3 (x − 3)\n\nSimilarly, external bisector direction = u_AB − u_AC (or u_AC − u_AB — gives opposite direction, same line):\n\nu_AB − u_AC = (−1/7 − 13/14, −4√3/7 + 3√3/14) = (−2/14 − 13/14, −8√3/14 + 3√3/14) = (−15/14, −5√3/14) = (−5/14)(3, √3)\n\nSo direction (3, √3), slope = √3 / 3 = 1/√3\n\nSo external bisector has slope 1/√3, passes through A:\n\ny − 12√3 = (1/√3)(x − 3)\n\nSo we have two lines:\n\nL₁ (internal): y = −√3 (x − 3) + 12√3 = −√3 x + 3√3 + 12√3 = −√3 x + 15√3  \nL₂ (external): y = (1/√3)(x − 3) + 12√3 = x/√3 − 3/√3 + 12√3 = x/√3 + (−3/√3 + 12√3)\n\nSimplify constant: −3/√3 = −√3, and 12√3, so total = 11√3  \nSo L₂: y = x/√3 + 11√3\n\nNow find intersection of each line with circle:\n\nCircle: (x − 27.5)² + y² = (27.5)² = 756.25\n\nLet’s use fractions: 27.5 = 55/2, so (55/2)² = 3025/4 = 756.25 ✔\n\nSo circle: (x − 55/2)² + y² = (55/2)²\n\nWe’ll solve for intersections.\n\nFirst, L₁: y = −√3 x + 15√3 = √3 (−x + 15)\n\nPlug into circle:\n\n(x − 55/2)² + [√3 (−x + 15)]² = (55/2)²  \n→ (x − 55/2)² + 3(−x + 15)² = (55/2)²\n\nCompute:\n\nLet’s expand both terms.\n\nFirst term: (x − 55/2)² = x² − 55x + (55/2)² = x² − 55x + 3025/4\n\nSecond term: 3(−x + 15)² = 3(x² − 30x + 225) = 3x² − 90x + 675\n\nSum: x² − 55x + 3025/4 + 3x² − 90x + 675 = 4x² − 145x + (3025/4 + 675)\n\nConvert 675 = 2700/4, so sum constant = (3025 + 2700)/4 = 5725/4\n\nSo left side = 4x² − 145x + 5725/4\n\nSet equal to right side = 3025/4\n\nSo:\n\n4x² − 145x + 5725/4 = 3025/4  \n→ 4x² − 145x + (5725 − 3025)/4 = 0  \n→ 4x² − 145x + 2700/4 = 0  \n→ 4x² − 145x + 675 = 0   [since 2700/4 = 675]\n\nNow solve quadratic: 4x² − 145x + 675 = 0\n\nDiscriminant D = 145² − 4·4·675 = 21025 − 16·675 = 21025 − 10800 = 10225\n\nCheck √10225: 101² = 10201, 102² = 10404 → no. Try 101.1²? Wait, factor: 10225 ÷ 25 = 409, and 409 is prime? 20.2² = 408.04, 20.22² ≈ 409. So maybe not perfect square? But geometry suggests nice answer.\n\nWait — perhaps made arithmetic error.\n\nLet’s double-check expansion.\n\nWe had:\n\n(x − 55/2)² = x² − 55x + (55/2)² = x² − 55x + 3025/4 ✔\n\n3(−x + 15)² = 3(x² − 30x + 225) = 3x² − 90x + 675 ✔\n\nSum: x² + 3x² = 4x²  \n−55x − 90x = −145x ✔  \nConstants: 3025/4 + 675 = 3025/4 + 2700/4 = 5725/4 ✔\n\nSet equal to 3025/4 ⇒ subtract: 5725/4 − 3025/4 = 2700/4 = 675 ✔\n\nSo equation: 4x² − 145x + 675 = 0 ✔\n\nNow compute discriminant again:\n\n145² = (140+5)² = 19600 + 1400 + 25 = 21025 ✔  \n4·4·675 = 16·675. Compute 675·16: 675·10=6750, 675·6=4050, total 10800 ✔  \n21025 − 10800 = 10225 ✔\n\nNow factor 10225: divide by 25 → 10225 / 25 = 409. And 409 is prime (yes, 409 is prime). So √10225 = 5√409 — messy. But answer should be nice. Maybe we misinterpreted bisectors?\n\nAlternative approach: Use known fact.\n\nPoints P such that ∠BAP = ∠CAP and ∠BPC = 90°.\n\nThat is, P lies on the Apollonius circle? Or use reflection.\n\nObservation: Condition ∠BAP = ∠CAP means AP is the angle bisector — so P lies on the locus of points where ratio of distances to AB and AC lines? No — angle condition is directional.\n\nBut another idea: Reflect one of B or C across the angle bisector.\n\nStandard trick: For angle bisector, reflection of B across internal bisector lies on line AC.\n\nBut here we also require ∠BPC = 90°.\n\nAlternatively, consider that set of points P with ∠BPC = 90° is circle Γ with diameter BC.\n\nAnd condition ∠BAP = ∠CAP means P lies on the locus of points from which segment BC subtends angle related to A? Not directly.\n\nWait — perhaps use trigonometric form.\n\nLet’s denote angle at A: ∠BAC = α.\n\nBy law of cosines:\n\ncos α = (AB² + AC² − BC²)/(2·AB·AC) = (21² + 56² − 55²)/(2·21·56)\n\nCompute:\n\n21² = 441  \n56² = 3136  \n55² = 3025  \nSo numerator = 441 + 3136 − 3025 = (3577) − 3025 = 552\n\nDenominator = 2·21·56 = 42·56 = let's compute: 40·56 = 2240, 2·56 = 112, total 2352\n\nSo cos α = 552 / 2352 = simplify: divide numerator & denominator by 24? 552 ÷ 24 = 23, 2352 ÷ 24 = 98? 24×98 = 2352? 24×100=2400, minus 24×2=48 → 2352 yes. 552 ÷ 24 = 23. So cos α = 23/98\n\nThen sin α = √(1 − (23/98)²) = √( (98² − 23²)/98² ) = √( (9604 − 529)/9604 ) = √(9075 / 9604)\n\n9075 = 25×363 = 25×3×121 = 75×121 = (25×3)×121 → 9075 = 25 × 363, and 363 = 3×121 = 3×11², so 9075 = 25×3×121 = 3×5²×11² → √9075 = 5×11×√3 = 55√3\n\n9604 = 98² = (2×49)² = 4×2401 = 4×7⁴ = (2×7²)² = 98², yes.\n\nSo sin α = √9075 / 98 = 55√3 / 98\n\nSo sin α = 55√3 / 98\n\nNow, the internal and external angle bisectors make angles α/2 and (π + α)/2 with AB, but perhaps coordinate approach was fine — but messy.\n\nMaybe instead of solving quadratics, notice symmetry: the two points P lie on circle with diameter BC, and on two lines through A — so chord of intersection of two lines with circle — distance between intersection points.\n\nBut the two lines intersect at A, and intersect circle at two points each — but we want one point per line (the two P’s), so total two points.\n\nSo distance between P₁ and P₂ is distance between the two intersection points of the two bisector lines with the circle.\n\nSince both lines pass through A, and circle is fixed, the segment P₁P₂ is a chord of the circle, but not necessarily diameter.\n\nAlternative insight: The two angle bisectors are perpendicular! Because internal and external bisectors are always perpendicular.\n\nIndeed, angle between them is 90°, since they bisect supplementary angles.\n\nSo lines L₁ and L₂ are perpendicular.\n\nSo we have two perpendicular lines through A, intersecting circle Γ (with diameter BC) at points P₁ and P₂ respectively.\n\nWe need distance between P₁ and P₂.\n\nLet O = center of circle = midpoint of BC = (27.5, 0)\n\nLet d = |OA|, distance from A to O.\n\nWe have A = (3, 12√3), O = (27.5, 0) = (55/2, 0)\n\nSo OA² = (55/2 − 3)² + (0 − 12√3)² = (55/2 − 6/2)² + 432 = (49/2)² + 432 = (2401/4) + 432 = 2401/4 + 1728/4 = 4129/4\n\nSo OA = √(4129/4) = √4129 / 2\n\nWhat is √4129? 64² = 4096, 65² = 4225, so ~64.26 — not nice.\n\nBut perhaps distance P₁P₂ can be found using geometry: For a circle radius R, and a point A outside, two perpendicular lines through A intersect circle at P₁, P₂. Distance P₁P₂?\n\nNot standard.\n\nBetter to solve the two quadratics and compute distance.\n\nWe already have for L₁: 4x² − 145x + 675 = 0\n\nLet’s solve it.\n\nx = [145 ± √10225] / 8\n\n√10225 = √(25×409) = 5√409\n\nSo x = [145 ± 5√409]/8\n\nThen y = −√3 x + 15√3 = √3 (15 − x)\n\nSo P₁ has coordinates:\n\nx₁ = [145 + 5√409]/8, y₁ = √3 (15 − x₁)\n\nx₂ = [145 − 5√409]/8, y₂ = √3 (15 − x₂)\n\nBut these are two points on same line L₁ — but we need one point from L₁ and one from L₂.\n\nSo for L₁, there are two intersections with circle — but only one is relevant? Problem says \"two points P in the plane\" satisfying both conditions — one on internal, one on external bisector.\n\nSo take one solution from L₁ and one from L₂.\n\nSo solve L₂ intersection.\n\nL₂: y = x/√3 + 11√3\n\nWrite as y = (x + 33)/√3 ? Check: x/√3 + 11√3 = x/√3 + 33/√3 = (x + 33)/√3 — yes! Because 11√3 = 11√3 × (√3/√3) = 33/√3.\n\nSo y = (x + 33)/√3\n\nNow plug into circle:\n\n(x − 55/2)² + y² = (55/2)²  \n→ (x − 55/2)² + (x + 33)² / 3 = 3025/4\n\nMultiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators:\n\n12(x − 55/2)² + 4(x + 33)² = 12·3025/4 = 3·3025 = 9075\n\nNow compute:\n\nFirst, (x − 55/2)² = x² − 55x + 3025/4, so 12 times = 12x² − 660x + 12·3025/4 = 12x² − 660x + 3·3025 = 12x² − 660x + 9075\n\nSecond, 4(x + 33)² = 4(x² + 66x + 1089) = 4x² + 264x + 4356\n\nSum: (12x² + 4x²) + (−660x + 264x) + (9075 + 4356) = 16x² − 396x + 13431\n\nSet equal to 9075:\n\n16x² − 396x + 13431 = 9075  \n→ 16x² − 396x + (13431 − 9075) = 0  \n→ 16x² − 396x + 4356 = 0\n\nDivide by 4: 4x² − 99x + 1089 = 0\n\nNow discriminant D = 99² − 4·4·1089 = 9801 − 16·1089\n\nCompute 1089×16: 1000×16=16000, 89×16=1424, total 17424\n\nSo D = 9801 − 17424 = negative? That can't be — means no intersection? But problem states there are two points, so must intersect.\n\nMistake: 1089×16: 1089×10=10890, 1089×6=6534, sum 17424 ✔  \n9801 − 17424 = −7623 < 0 → no real intersection? Contradiction.\n\nSo error in line equation for external bisector.\n\nLet’s double-check external bisector.\n\nEarlier, we used u_AB − u_AC, but direction of external bisector is proportional to (AB / |AB|) − (AC / |AC|), yes.\n\nBut let's verify with angle bisector theorem: external bisector divides opposite side externally in ratio of adjacent sides.\n\nThe external bisector of ∠A intersects line BC at point D such that BD/DC = AB/AC = 21/56 = 3/8, externally.\n\nSo BD/DC = 3/8, external ⇒ D lies on extension of BC beyond C or B.\n\nLet’s find coordinates of D on line BC (x-axis) such that BD/DC = 3/8 externally.\n\nIf D is on x-axis, B=0, C=55, let D = d.\n\nExternal division: BD/DC = AB/AC = 3/8, and D not between B and C.\n\nFormula for external division of B and C in ratio m:n is (m·C − n·B)/(m − n) = (3·55 − 8·0)/(3 − 8) = 165 / (−5) = −33\n\nSo D = −33 on x-axis.\n\nSo external bisector is line from A=(3,12√3) to D=(−33,0)\n\nSlope = (0 − 12√3)/(−33 − 3) = (−12√3)/(−36) = √3/3 = 1/√3 — matches earlier.\n\nSo line is correct.\n\nThen why no intersection? Let's check distance from A to circle center O.\n\nO = (27.5, 0), A = (3, 12√3) ≈ (3, 20.7846)\n\nDistance AO ≈ √[(24.5)² + (20.7846)²] = √[600.25 + 432] = √1032.25 ≈ 32.13\n\nRadius R = 27.5, so A is outside circle (32.13 > 27.5), so lines from A should intersect circle at two points each.\n\nBut our quadratic for L₂ gave negative discriminant, so algebra error.\n\nLet’s recalculate L₂ intersection carefully.\n\nL₂: y = x/√3 + 11√3\n\nCompute y² = (x/√3 + 11√3)² = (x/√3)² + 2·x/√3·11√3 + (11√3)² = x²/3 + 22x + 121·3 = x²/3 + 22x + 363\n\nBecause: (x/√3)(11√3) = x·11·(√3/√3) = 11x, times 2 is 22x. And (11√3)² = 121·3 = 363.\n\nYes.\n\nNow (x − 55/2)² = x² − 55x + (55/2)² = x² − 55x + 3025/4\n\nSo sum:\n\nx² − 55x + 3025/4 + x²/3 + 22x + 363 = 3025/4\n\nSimplify left:\n\nx² + x²/3 = (4/3)x²  \n−55x + 22x = −33x  \nConstants: 3025/4 + 363 = 3025/4 + 1452/4 = 4477/4\n\nSo left side = (4/3)x² − 33x + 4477/4\n\nSet equal to 3025/4:\n\n(4/3)x² − 33x + 4477/4 = 3025/4  \n→ (4/3)x² − 33x + (4477 − 3025)/4 = 0  \n→ (4/3)x² − 33x + 1452/4 = 0  \n→ (4/3)x² − 33x + 363 = 0\n\nMultiply by 3: 4x² − 99x + 1089 = 0 — same as before.\n\nNow discriminant: 99² = 9801, 4·4·1089 = 16·1089.\n\n1089 = 33², since 30²=900, 33²=1089.\n\nSo 16·1089 = 16·33² = (4·33)² = 132² = 17424\n\n9801 − 17424 = negative — impossible.\n\nBut geometrically, line from A to D=(-33,0) — let's see if it intersects circle.\n\nA=(3,20.78), D=(-33,0), so parametric: x = 3 + t(-36) = 3 − 36t, y = 20.78 + t(−20.78) = 20.78(1 − t)\n\nAt t=0, A; t=1, D.\n\nCircle: (x − 27.5)² + y² = 27.5² = 756.25\n\nAt D=(-33,0): (−33 − 27.5)² + 0 = (−60.5)² = 3660.25 > 756.25, so D is outside.\n\nAt A: (3−27.5)² + (20.78)² = (−24.5)² + 432 = 600.25 + 432 = 1032.25 > 756.25, also outside.\n\nBut the line may not intersect if it's too far.\n\nDistance from center O=(27.5,0) to line L₂.\n\nLine L₂: y = x/√3 + 11√3, or in standard form: x/√3 − y + 11√3 = 0\n\nMultiply by √3: x − √3 y + 33 = 0\n\nSo line: x − √3 y + 33 = 0\n\nDistance from O=(27.5, 0) to this line is |27.5 − 0 + 33| / √(1² + (√3)²) = |60.5| / √(1 + 3) = 60.5 / 2 = 30.25\n\nRadius is 27.5, and 30.25 > 27.5, so line does NOT intersect the circle!\n\nBut problem states there are two such points P. So our assumption that external bisector is the other one must be wrong.\n\nPerhaps both points lie on the internal bisector? But internal bisector is one line, intersects circle at two points — and for each, does ∠BAP = ∠CAP hold? Yes, since on the bisector. And ∠BPC = 90° by construction. So two points on the same line.\n\nThe problem says \"two points P in the plane\", and \"∠BAP = ∠CAP\" — which is satisfied for any P on the angle bisector line (internal or external), but perhaps only the internal is intended, and it intersects the circle at two points.\n\nLet’s check distance from O to internal bisector L₁.\n\nL₁: y = −√3 x + 15√3, or √3 x + y − 15√3 = 0\n\nStandard form: √3 x + y − 15√3 = 0\n\nDistance from O=(27.5, 0): |√3·27.5 + 0 − 15√3| / √( (√3)² + 1² ) = |√3(27.5 − 15)| / √(3 + 1) = |√3·12.5| / 2 = (12.5√3)/2 = 6.25√3 ≈ 6.25×1.732 = 10.825\n\nRadius = 27.5, and 10.825 < 27.5, so yes, intersects at two points.\n\nSo the two points are the two intersections of the internal angle bisector with the circle with diameter BC.\n\nThen distance between them is the length of the chord cut by the line on the circle.\n\nFor a circle radius R, distance from center to line is d, chord length = 2√(R² − d²)\n\nHere R = 55/2 = 27.5, d = distance from O to L₁ = 6.25√3\n\nCompute d² = (6.25√3)² = (25/4)² * 3 = (625/16)*3 = 1875/16\n\nR² = (55/2)² = 3025/4 = 12100/16\n\nSo R² − d² = (12100 − 1875)/16 = 10225/16\n\nSo chord length = 2√(10225/16) = 2 * √10225 / 4 = √10225 / 2\n\nBut √10225 = √(25×409) = 5√409\n\nSo length = 5√409 / 2\n\nBut problem likely expects integer or nice answer. Perhaps 409 is 20.2^2? No.\n\nWait, earlier we had discriminant 10225 for the quadratic, and chord length is √(discriminant)/|a| for quadratic ax²+bx+c=0? For line intersecting circle, the distance between intersection points can be found from quadratic.\n\nFrom earlier, for L₁, we had quadratic 4x² − 145x + 675 = 0\n\nRoots x₁, x₂, difference x₁ − x₂ = √D / a = √10225 / 4\n\nThen y₁ − y₂ = −√3 (x₁ − x₂) since y = −√3 x + const\n\nSo Δx = √10225 / 4, Δy = −√3 √10225 / 4\n\nThen distance = √(Δx² + Δy²) = √[ (10225/16) + 3·10225/16 ] = √[4·10225/16] = √[10225/4] = √10225 / 2 = 5√409 / 2\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut perhaps 409 is 409, and answer is 5√409 / 2, but unlikely.\n\nMaybe we placed B and C wrong. Try different placement.\n\nOr use properties: The two points P are the intersections of the angle bisector with the circle, and the distance is the chord length.\n\nBut perhaps compute numerically.\n\n√409 ≈ 20.2237, so 5*20.2237 = 101.1185, /2 = 50.559\n\nBut 55 is BC, so plausible.\n\nBut answer might be 55, or 42, etc.\n\nAnother idea: Use inversion or known result.\n\nSearch for similar problem: Points P such that ∠BAP = ∠CAP and ∠BPC = 90°.\n\nThis is equivalent to P lying on the angle bisector and on the circle with diameter BC.\n\nSo chord length is what we have.\n\nPerhaps simplify 10225.\n\n10225 divided by 25 = 409, and 409 is prime, so yes.\n\nSo answer is √10225 / 2 = 5√409 / 2\n\nBut maybe write as fraction.\n\nOr perhaps the problem expects the answer as \\frac{5\\sqrt{409}}{2}, but in JSON we need exact value, so \"5*sqrt(409)/2\" or as decimal? No, exact.\n\nBut let's check if 409 is correct.\n\nFrom earlier, cos α = 23/98, so α = arccos(23/98)\n\nThen the distance from A to BC is height h = AB sin(angle at B)? Better: area of triangle.\n\nUse Heron's formula.\n\ns = (21 + 55 + 56)/2 = 132/2 = 66\n\nArea = √[s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c)] = √[66·45·11·10] = √[66·45·110]\n\nCompute: 66·110 = 7260, 7260·45 = 7260·40 + 7260·5 = 290400 + 36300 = 326700\n\nSo area = √326700\n\nSimplify: 326700 = 100·3267 = 100·3·1089 = 300·1089 = 300·33² = (10·33)² · 3 = 330² · 3? 330² = 108900, times 3 = 326700 yes.\n\nSo area = √(330² · 3) = 330√3\n\nSo height from A to BC is h = 2·area / BC = 2·330√3 / 55 = 660√3 / 55 = 12√3, matches our coordinate y-coordinate.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, the internal bisector intersects BC at point E such that BE/EC = AB/AC = 21/56 = 3/8\n\nSo BE = (3/11)·55 = 15, EC = 40\n\nSo E = (15, 0) since B=0, C=55.\n\nSo internal bisector is line from A=(3,12√3) to E=(15,0)\n\nSlope = (0 − 12√3)/(15 − 3) = (−12√3)/12 = −√3, same as before.\n\nSo line is correct.\n\nThen distance from O=(27.5,0) to line AE.\n\nLine through (3,12√3) and (15,0)\n\nVector form: direction (12, −12√3), so normal vector (√3, 1) or something.\n\nEquation: (y − 0) = −√3 (x − 15), so y = −√3 x + 15√3, same.\n\nSo all correct.\n\nThus chord length is √10225 / 2 = 5√409 / 2\n\nPerhaps answer is \\frac{5\\sqrt{409}}{2}, but let's see if 409 can be written as something else.\n\n409 = 400 + 9 = 20^2 + 3^2, not helpful.\n\nMaybe the problem wants the distance squared? No.\n\nOr perhaps I miscalculated the quadratic.\n\nFrom earlier, for L₁, we had:\n\n(x − 55/2)² + 3(−x + 15)² = (55/2)²\n\nLet me plug x=15: left = (15 − 27.5)² + 3(0)² = (−12.5)² = 156.25, right = 756.25, not equal.\n\nx=0: (−27.5)² + 3(15)² = 756.25 + 675 = 1431.25 > 756.25\n\nx=30: (2.5)² + 3(−15)² = 6.25 + 675 = 681.25 < 756.25\n\nx=31: (3.5)² + 3(−16)² = 12.25 + 768 = 780.25 > 756.25\n\nSo roots around 30.2 and 30.8? But earlier quadratic 4x² − 145x + 675 = 0, at x=30: 4*900=3600, −145*30=−4350, +675 = 3600−4350+675 = −75, negative.\n\nAt x=0: +675 >0, so roots one small, one large.\n\nx=5: 4*25=100, −725 +675 = 50 >0\n\nx=10: 400 −1450 +675 = −375 <0\n\nSo roots between 0-5 and 10-? At x=35: 4*1225=4900, −5075 +675 = 500 >0, so between 10-35.\n\nAnyway, the calculation seems consistent.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 55, but let's think differently.\n\nAnother approach: Use complex numbers or geometry.\n\nThe two points P are such that AP is angle bisector and BPC is right angle.\n\nThen by circle property, P lies on circle diameter BC, so BP² + CP² = BC² = 55² = 3025\n\nAlso, by angle bisector theorem in triangle BPC? Not directly.\n\nPerhaps use coordinates and accept 5√409 / 2.\n\nBut let's compute numerical value: √409 ≈ 20.223748, times 5 = 101.11874, /2 = 50.55937\n\nNow, is there a nice number near? 50.5 = 101/2, but not.\n\nPerhaps answer is 55, or 42, or 33.\n\nWait, BC=55, AB=21, AC=56, note 21-28-35 is 3-4-5, but 21-56-55: 21²+56² = 441+3136=3577, 55²=3025, not.\n\n21-55-56: 55²+21² = 3025+441=3466, 56²=3136.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps the distance is BC itself, 55.\n\nOr diameter.\n\nBut chord length less than diameter 55, and we have ~50.56, close to 55.\n\nPerhaps exact value is \\frac{55}{\\sqrt{3}} or something, but 55/1.732≈31.75.\n\nNo.\n\nGiven time, and that Problem 1 is 90, and Problem 2 likely expects a nice answer, perhaps I missed that the two points are symmetric and distance is 2* something.\n\nOr perhaps use formula for chord length: 2R sin θ, where θ is half the central angle.\n\nBut we have distance from center to line d = R cos φ, where φ is angle between radius to midpoint of chord and line.\n\nThen chord length = 2√(R² − d²) = 2√(756.25 − (6.25√3)²) = 2√(756.25 − 117.1875) = 2√639.0625 = 2*25.28 = 50.56, same.\n\n639.0625 = 639 + 1/16 = (10225/16), as before.\n\nSo I think answer is \\frac{\\sqrt{10225}}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{409}}{2}\n\nSo for JSON, answer_2 = \"5*sqrt(409)/2\" or as a single radical? Usually written as fraction.\n\nBut the problem says \"exact value\", so \\frac{5\\sqrt{409}}{2}\n\nIn JSON, we can write \"5*sqrt(409)/2\"\n\nOr perhaps they want decimal, but no, exact.\n\nLooking back at Problem 1, it's integer, so Problem 2 might be integer.\n\nLet me try different placement: Put A at origin.\n\nLet A = (0,0), AB along x-axis.\n\nLet B = (21,0), since AB = 21.\n\nLet C = (x,y) such that AC = 56, BC = 55.\n\nSo x² + y² = 56² = 3136  \n(x − 21)² + y² = 55² = 3025\n\nSubtract: (x−21)² − x² = 3025 − 3136 = −111  \nx² −42x +441 − x² = −111  \n−42x = −552  \nx = 552/42 = 92/7 ≈ 13.1429\n\nThen y² = 3136 − x² = 3136 − (92/7)² = 3136 − 8464/49 = (3136*49 − 8464)/49\n\n3136*49 = 3136*(50−1) = 156800 − 3136 = 153664\n\n153664 − 8464 = 145200\n\nSo y² = 145200 / 49 = (145200 ÷ 4) / (49÷?) 145200 = 100*1452 = 100*12*121 = 1200*121 = 145200, and 121=11², so y = (110√12)/7? 145200 = 1452 * 100 = (4*363)*100 = 4*3*121*100 = 12*121*100, so y = √(12*121*100 / 49) = (11*10*2√3)/7 = 220√3 / 7\n\nSo C = (92/7, 220√3/7)\n\nThen angle bisector of ∠A is line that makes equal angles with AB (x-axis) and AC.\n\nUnit vector along AB: (1,0)\n\nUnit vector along AC: C / |AC| = C / 56 = (92/7/56, 220√3/7/56) = (92/(7*56), 220√3/(7*56)) = (92/392, 220√3/392) = (23/98, 55√3/98)\n\nThen internal bisector direction = (1,0) + (23/98, 55√3/98) = (121/98, 55√3/98)\n\nSo slope = (55√3/98) / (121/98) = 55√3 / 121 = 5√3 / 11\n\nSo line y = (5√3/11) x\n\nThen circle with diameter BC: B=(21,0), C=(92/7, 220√3/7)\n\nMidpoint O = ((21 + 92/7)/2, (0 + 220√3/7)/2) = ((147/7 + 92/7)/2, 110√3/7) = (239/7 / 2, 110√3/7) = (239/14, 110√3/7)\n\nRadius R = BC/2 = 55/2\n\nThen distance from O to line y − (5√3/11)x = 0\n\nLine: (5√3/11)x − y = 0\n\nDistance = |(5√3/11)x_O − y_O| / √((5√3/11)² + 1) = |(5√3/11)(239/14) − 110√3/7| / √(75/121 + 1) = |√3 [5*239/(11*14) − 110/7]| / √(196/121) = |√3 [1195/154 − 2420/154]| / (14/11) = |√3 (−1225/154)| * 11/14 = √3 * 1225/154 * 11/14\n\nSimplify: 1225 = 35², 154 = 14*11, so 1225/(154) * 11/14 = 1225/(14*11) * 11/14 = 1225/196 = (35/14)² = (5/2)² = 25/4\n\nSo distance = √3 * 25/4 = 25√3/4\n\nThen R = 55/2, R² = 3025/4, d² = (625*3)/16 = 1875/16 = 7500/64, better common denominator.\n\nR² = 3025/4 = 12100/16, d² = (25√3/4)² = 1875/16, same as before! So R² − d² = 10225/16, same.\n\nSo chord length = 2√(R² − d²) = 2*√10225/4 = √10225/2 = 5√409/2\n\nSo confirmed.\n\nTherefore answer_2 = \"5*sqrt(409)/2\"\n\nBut perhaps write as \\frac{5\\sqrt{409}}{2}, but in JSON string, use \"5*sqrt(409)/2\"\n\nNow for final answer.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: k = \\\\binom{5}{2} + 80 = 10 + 80 = 90.
