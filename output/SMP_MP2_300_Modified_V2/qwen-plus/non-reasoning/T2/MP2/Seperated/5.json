  "reasoning_content": "Let's solve each problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 1:**\n\nWe are told:\n\n- A committee of 5 is to be chosen from 9 people.\n- Bill and Karl must serve together or not at all. (i.e., either both are on the committee, or neither.)\n- Alice and Jane refuse to serve with each other. (i.e., they cannot both be on the committee.)\n\nBut the question says:\n\n> Instead of determining the total number of valid committee selections, simply find $k$, the number of valid committees **when the must-serve-together pair is excluded** and the **refusing-to-serve-together pair is both included**.\n\nSo we want:\n\n- Bill and Karl are **both excluded** (i.e., neither is on the committee).\n- Alice and Jane are **both included** (i.e., both are on the committee).\n\nAnd the committee size is 5.\n\nSo far, we have:\n\n- Fixed members: Alice and Jane → 2 people.\n- Excluded: Bill and Karl → so they are not available.\n- Total people: 9.\n\nSo let’s list the 9 people: assume they are {Alice, Jane, Bill, Karl} ∪ other 5 people = let’s call the remaining 5 people: C, D, E, F, G (just labels). So total 9.\n\nWe are to choose a 5-person committee such that:\n\n- Alice ∈ committee ✅  \n- Jane ∈ committee ✅  \n- Bill ∉ committee ✅  \n- Karl ∉ committee ✅  \n\nSo Alice and Jane are in → 2 spots taken.\n\nWe need 3 more members, chosen from the remaining people *excluding* Bill and Karl, and also excluding Alice and Jane (since they’re already placed), i.e., from the other 5 people: C, D, E, F, G.\n\nSo number of ways = number of ways to choose 3 people from those 5 = C(5,3) = 10.\n\nBUT — wait! Is there any restriction violated by including Alice and Jane together? Yes — the problem says “Alice and Jane refuse to serve with each other”, meaning they **cannot both be on the committee**. So a committee with both Alice and Jane is *invalid* under the overall constraints.\n\nHowever, the problem says:\n\n> find $k$, the number of valid committees **when the must-serve-together pair is excluded and the refusing-to-serve-together pair is both included**.\n\nThis seems contradictory — because if Alice and Jane both serve, it violates their constraint. But the problem is asking for the count *under those specific conditions*, regardless of validity? Wait — read carefully.\n\nActually, reread the exact wording:\n\n> How many ways can it be chosen, if Bill and Karl must serve together or not at all, and Alice and Jane refuse to serve with each other? Instead of determining the total number of valid committee selections, simply find $k$, the number of valid committees when the must-serve-together pair is excluded and the refusing-to-serve-together pair is both included.\n\nWait — this is confusing. It says “find k, the number of valid committees when [conditions]”. So “valid committees” means committees satisfying *all* constraints — but then it specifies additional conditions: must-serve-together pair is excluded (so Bill & Karl out), and refusing pair is both included (Alice & Jane in). But Alice & Jane both in violates the “refuse to serve together” constraint.\n\nSo how can such a committee be *valid*? It can’t.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the phrasing means: compute the number of committees satisfying:\n\n- Bill and Karl are both excluded,\n- Alice and Jane are both included,\n\nand *ignore* whether that violates the “refuse” constraint — i.e., just compute the count under those two fixed conditions, as a subcase (even though it’s invalid overall), and that count is k.\n\nBut the problem says “the number of valid committees when …”, which suggests that under those conditions, the committee is still valid — but it can’t be, unless we misinterpret “refuse to serve with each other”.\n\nWait — maybe “refuse to serve with each other” means they won’t serve *if the other is present*, but the problem is asking for committees where they *are* both present — so those committees are *not valid*, hence k = 0?\n\nBut that seems too trivial.\n\nLet’s re-read the sentence again:\n\n> How many ways can it be chosen, if Bill and Karl must serve together or not at all, and Alice and Jane refuse to serve with each other? Instead of determining the total number of valid committee selections, simply find $k$, the number of valid committees when the must-serve-together pair is excluded and the refusing-to-serve-together pair is both included.\n\nKey phrase: “valid committees when …” — i.e., committees that satisfy all original constraints *and also* have Bill/Karl excluded *and* Alice/Jane both included.\n\nBut original constraints include “Alice and Jane refuse to serve with each other”, i.e., the committee must NOT contain both. So any committee with both Alice and Jane violates the constraint ⇒ no such valid committee exists.\n\nHence k = 0.\n\nThat makes sense. Because “valid” means satisfying all constraints; adding extra conditions doesn’t override the base constraints.\n\nSo k = number of 5-person subsets of 9 people such that:\n\n- Bill ∉ committee AND Karl ∉ committee,\n- Alice ∈ committee AND Jane ∈ committee,\n- AND (Alice and Jane not both in) ← contradiction.\n\nSo impossible ⇒ k = 0.\n\nYes, that must be it. The problem is testing attention to logical consistency.\n\nSo answer to Problem 1 is 0.\n\nLet’s double-check: Is there any interpretation where “refuse to serve with each other” could mean something else? Like they refuse to serve *unless* some condition holds? No — standard interpretation is mutual exclusion: at most one of them may serve.\n\nThus, requiring both violates the rule ⇒ no valid committee satisfies all constraints and has both Alice and Jane. So k = 0.\n\n✅ So answer_1 = 0.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\nAn ant starts at (0,0). Each second, from (x,y), it moves to one of:\n\n- (x−1, y−1)  \n- (x−1, y+1)  \n- (x+1, y−1)  \n- (x+1, y+1)\n\nSo in each move, x changes by ±1, and y changes by ±1, independently.\n\nSo each move is a vector in {(±1, ±1)} — four possibilities.\n\nAfter t seconds, it has made t moves, each contributing (Δx, Δy) ∈ {(±1,±1)}.\n\nLet’s define:\n\nLet a = number of moves of type (+1, +1)  \nb = number of moves of type (+1, −1)  \nc = number of moves of type (−1, +1)  \nd = number of moves of type (−1, −1)\n\nThen total moves: a + b + c + d = 4020.\n\nNet x-displacement = (a + b) − (c + d) = (a + b) − (c + d)  \nNet y-displacement = (a + c) − (b + d)\n\nWe want final position (2010, 2010), so:\n\nx: (a + b) − (c + d) = 2010  \ny: (a + c) − (b + d) = 2010\n\nAlso, total moves: a + b + c + d = 4020.\n\nLet’s simplify.\n\nLet:\n\nS = a + b + c + d = 4020  \nX = (a + b) − (c + d) = 2010  \nY = (a + c) − (b + d) = 2010\n\nNote that:\n\na + b = (S + X)/2 ⇒ since (a+b) − (c+d) = X and (a+b) + (c+d) = S ⇒ adding: 2(a+b) = S + X ⇒ a+b = (S + X)/2\n\nSimilarly, c+d = (S − X)/2\n\nSame for y: a + c = (S + Y)/2, b + d = (S − Y)/2\n\nCompute:\n\nS = 4020, X = 2010, Y = 2010\n\nSo:\n\na + b = (4020 + 2010)/2 = 6030/2 = 3015  \nc + d = 4020 − 3015 = 1005\n\na + c = (4020 + 2010)/2 = 3015  \nb + d = 1005\n\nNow we have:\n\n(1) a + b = 3015  \n(2) a + c = 3015  \n(3) c + d = 1005  \n(4) b + d = 1005  \n(5) a + b + c + d = 4020 (redundant)\n\nFrom (1) and (2): a + b = a + c ⇒ b = c\n\nFrom (3) and (4): c + d = b + d ⇒ c = b — consistent.\n\nLet b = c = t\n\nThen from (1): a = 3015 − t  \nFrom (3): d = 1005 − c = 1005 − t\n\nAll variables must be non-negative integers.\n\nSo constraints:\n\na = 3015 − t ≥ 0 ⇒ t ≤ 3015  \nb = t ≥ 0  \nc = t ≥ 0  \nd = 1005 − t ≥ 0 ⇒ t ≤ 1005\n\nSo t ∈ [0, 1005], integer.\n\nSo t can be 0,1,2,…,1005 → 1006 possible values.\n\nFor each t, the number of sequences (i.e., orderings of moves) with counts a,b,c,d is the multinomial coefficient:\n\nNumber = 4020! / (a! b! c! d!) = 4020! / [(3015 − t)! · t! · t! · (1005 − t)!]\n\nSo total number of paths = sum over t = 0 to 1005 of 4020! / [(3015 − t)! t! t! (1005 − t)!]\n\nBut this looks messy — maybe there's a better combinatorial interpretation.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nEach move changes x and y by ±1. So after n moves, x and y have same parity as n, since each move changes both coordinates by odd amounts (±1), so x ≡ n mod 2, y ≡ n mod 2.\n\nHere n = 4020, even; target (2010,2010) — both even ⇒ OK.\n\nLet’s define:\n\nLet u = number of right moves (x+1): that’s moves (+1, +1) and (+1, −1) ⇒ u = a + b  \nLet v = number of left moves (x−1): c + d = 4020 − u  \nThen net x = u − (4020 − u) = 2u − 4020 = 2010 ⇒ 2u = 6030 ⇒ u = 3015 — matches earlier.\n\nSimilarly, let p = number of up moves (y+1): a + c = ?  \nNet y = p − (4020 − p) = 2p − 4020 = 2010 ⇒ p = 3015.\n\nSo indeed, exactly 3015 moves increase x, 3015 increase y.\n\nSo we need sequences of 4020 moves, each being one of four types, such that:\n\n- Exactly 3015 moves have Δx = +1 (i.e., type (+1,±1))  \n- Exactly 3015 moves have Δy = +1 (i.e., type (±1,+1))\n\nSo think of assigning to each move a pair (dx, dy) ∈ {−1,+1}².\n\nWe need sum dx_i = 2010, sum dy_i = 2010.\n\nBut sum dx_i = (# of +1 in x) − (# of −1 in x) = (u) − (4020 − u) = 2u − 4020 = 2010 ⇒ u = 3015, as before.\n\nSame for y.\n\nSo we need number of 4020-length sequences over alphabet {(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1)} such that:\n\n- Number of entries with first coordinate +1 is 3015  \n- Number of entries with second coordinate +1 is 3015\n\nLet A = count of (1,1)  \nB = count of (1,-1)  \nC = count of (-1,1)  \nD = count of (-1,-1)\n\nThen:\n\nA + B = 3015  (x+1 moves)  \nA + C = 3015  (y+1 moves)  \nA + B + C + D = 4020\n\nAs before ⇒ B = C, and D = 4020 − (A + B + C) = 4020 − (A + 2B)\n\nBut from A + B = 3015 ⇒ A = 3015 − B  \nSo D = 4020 − ((3015 − B) + 2B) = 4020 − (3015 + B) = 1005 − B\n\nSo D = 1005 − B ≥ 0 ⇒ B ≤ 1005, and B ≥ 0.\n\nSo B ranges 0 to 1005, and for each B, A = 3015 − B, C = B, D = 1005 − B.\n\nSo same as before with t = B.\n\nSo total number = Σ_{B=0}^{1005} 4020! / [A! B! C! D!] = Σ_{B=0}^{1005} 4020! / [(3015−B)! B! B! (1005−B)!]\n\nCan this sum be simplified?\n\nLet’s try small analogous case to guess pattern.\n\nSuppose we want to go from (0,0) to (2,2) in 4 steps.\n\nThen u = (4 + 2)/2 = 3 x+1 moves, p = 3 y+1 moves.\n\nSo A + B = 3, A + C = 3, A+B+C+D = 4 ⇒ D = 4 − (A+B+C) = 4 − (3 + C) = 1 − C ⇒ C ≤ 1.\n\nFrom A = 3 − B, C = B, D = 1 − B ⇒ B = 0 or 1.\n\nIf B = 0: A = 3, C = 0, D = 1 → check sum: 3+0+0+1 = 4 ✔  \nIf B = 1: A = 2, C = 1, D = 0 → sum = 4 ✔\n\nSo terms:\n\nB=0: 4!/(3! 0! 0! 1!) = 24 / (6·1·1·1) = 4  \nB=1: 4!/(2! 1! 1! 0!) = 24 / (2·1·1·1) = 12  \nTotal = 16.\n\nIs there another way to compute number of paths to (2,2) in 4 steps? Each step is diagonal.\n\nNote that each step is like a king move but only diagonals — so it's equivalent to moving in Z^2 with steps (±1,±1). This is same as rotating coordinates.\n\nLet’s define new coordinates:\n\nLet u = x + y  \nv = x − y\n\nThen each move:\n\n(+1,+1) → Δu = +2, Δv = 0  \n(+1,−1) → Δu = 0, Δv = +2  \n(−1,+1) → Δu = 0, Δv = −2  \n(−1,−1) → Δu = −2, Δv = 0\n\nSo moves change either u by ±2 or v by ±2, but not both.\n\nSo in terms of (u,v), each move is (±2,0) or (0,±2).\n\nStart at (0,0) → u=0, v=0  \nTarget (2010,2010) → u = 4020, v = 0\n\nSo we need to go from (u,v) = (0,0) to (4020, 0) in 4020 steps, each step being (±2,0) or (0,±2).\n\nBut each step changes u or v by ±2, so after s steps, total |Δu| + |Δv| in terms of units of 2.\n\nLet’s define:\n\nLet p = number of (+2,0) moves — i.e., (+1,+1) moves  \nq = number of (−2,0) moves — i.e., (−1,−1) moves  \nr = number of (0,+2) moves — i.e., (+1,−1) moves  \ns = number of (0,−2) moves — i.e., (−1,+1) moves  \n\nThen:\n\nTotal moves: p + q + r + s = 4020  \nNet u = 2(p − q) = 4020 ⇒ p − q = 2010  \nNet v = 2(r − s) = 0 ⇒ r = s\n\nFrom p − q = 2010 and p + q = ? Let T = p + q, then p = (T + 2010)/2, q = (T − 2010)/2 ⇒ T must be ≥ 2010 and same parity.\n\nAlso r = s, and r + s = 4020 − T = 2r ⇒ r = (4020 − T)/2\n\nSo T must be even? 4020 is even, so T must be even for r integer.\n\nAlso p,q ≥ 0 ⇒ T ≥ 2010 and T ≡ 2010 mod 2 ⇒ since 2010 even, T even.\n\nSo T = 2010, 2012, ..., up to 4020.\n\nBut p = (T + 2010)/2 ≤ 4020? Well, max T = 4020 ⇒ p = (4020 + 2010)/2 = 6030/2 = 3015, ok.\n\nMin T = 2010 ⇒ p = (2010 + 2010)/2 = 2010, q = 0.\n\nSo T ranges from 2010 to 4020 step 2.\n\nNumber of possible T: from 2010 to 4020 inclusive, step 2 ⇒ number = ((4020 − 2010)/2) + 1 = (2010/2) + 1 = 1005 + 1 = 1006 — same as before.\n\nFor each T, p = (T + 2010)/2, q = (T − 2010)/2, r = s = (4020 − T)/2\n\nThen number of sequences = 4020! / (p! q! r! s!)\n\nSame sum.\n\nBut perhaps there's a closed form.\n\nNotice that the generating function for one step is:\n\nf(X,Y) = X Y + X Y^{-1} + X^{-1} Y + X^{-1} Y^{-1} = (X + X^{-1})(Y + Y^{-1})\n\nSo after n steps, coefficient of X^{a} Y^{b} in [(X + X^{-1})(Y + Y^{-1})]^n = [X + X^{-1}]^n [Y + Y^{-1}]^n\n\nSo coefficient of X^{2010} Y^{2010} in [(X + X^{-1})(Y + Y^{-1})]^{4020} = [X + X^{-1}]^{4020} [Y + Y^{-1}]^{4020}\n\nSince the two factors are independent.\n\nSo coefficient of X^{2010} in (X + X^{-1})^{4020} times coefficient of Y^{2010} in (Y + Y^{-1})^{4020}\n\nNow, (X + X^{-1})^n = Σ_{k=0}^n C(n,k) X^{n−2k}\n\nBecause term k corresponds to choosing X^{-1} k times, X (n−k) times ⇒ exponent = (n−k) − k = n − 2k\n\nSo exponent e = n − 2k ⇒ k = (n − e)/2\n\nSo coefficient of X^e is C(n, (n−e)/2) if n−e even and 0 ≤ (n−e)/2 ≤ n.\n\nHere n = 4020, e = 2010 ⇒ k = (4020 − 2010)/2 = 2010/2 = 1005\n\nSo coefficient = C(4020, 1005)\n\nSimilarly for Y.\n\nSo total number = [C(4020, 1005)]²\n\nWait — is that correct?\n\nBecause (X + X^{-1})^n [Y + Y^{-1}]^n, and we want coeff of X^{2010} Y^{2010}, and since independent, yes, product of coefficients.\n\nSo answer = [C(4020, 1005)]²\n\nLet’s verify with small case: (2,2) in 4 steps.\n\nThen n = 4, e = 2 ⇒ k = (4−2)/2 = 1 ⇒ C(4,1) = 4, squared = 16 — matches our earlier manual count! ✅\n\nSo yes! The number is [C(4020, 1005)]²\n\nSo answer_2 = \\binom{4020}{1005}^2\n\nBut the problem asks for \"in how many ways\", and this is an integer, huge, but exact.\n\nSo we leave it as that expression? But the instructions say \"provide your final answers in the exact JSON format\" and \"for numerical answers, provide the exact value\". But \\binom{4020}{1005}^2 is too large to compute explicitly — but perhaps they want the expression? No, the example shows \"42\", a number.\n\nBut in contest problems like this, the answer is left as binomial coefficient squared, but here maybe we need to output the expression? But instructions say \"exact value\", and it's an integer, so technically correct to write it as that, but JSON expects a string? No — the example has \"42\" as string, so probably they expect the numeric string, but it's astronomically large.\n\nWait — maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me double-check the generating function logic.\n\nThe step set is {(±1,±1)}, so the 2D generating function per step is x y + x y^{-1} + x^{-1} y + x^{-1} y^{-1} = (x + x^{-1})(y + y^{-1})\n\nYes.\n\nThen n steps: [(x + x^{-1})(y + y^{-1})]^n = (x + x^{-1})^n (y + y^{-1})^n\n\nCoefficient of x^a y^b is [coeff of x^a in (x + x^{-1})^n] × [coeff of y^b in (y + y^{-1})^n]\n\nYes.\n\nAnd coeff of x^a in (x + x^{-1})^n is C(n, k) where n − 2k = a ⇒ k = (n − a)/2\n\nSo for a = 2010, n = 4020, k = (4020 − 2010)/2 = 1005, so C(4020, 1005)\n\nSame for y.\n\nSo total = C(4020, 1005)^2\n\nThat is the exact answer.\n\nIn programming competition contexts, this is acceptable as the answer — written as \\binom{4020}{1005}^2, but since JSON requires a string without LaTeX, and the problem says \"exact value\", and it's an integer, perhaps we need to output it as a string of digits? But that's infeasible manually.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the expression in terms of binomial coefficient? However, the instruction says \"for numerical answers, provide the exact value\", and \"no LaTeX\", so likely they expect the expression evaluated? But it's too big.\n\nWait — perhaps there's a simplification I missed.\n\nAnother thought: Since each move changes x and y by ±1, the ant’s position after n steps has x + y even, etc., but we already used that.\n\nOr perhaps parity: x and y always have same parity as n, which they do.\n\nBut no, the generating function derivation is solid and verified on small case.\n\nSo answer is \\binom{4020}{1005}^2.\n\nIn JSON, we need to put it as a string? But the example has \"42\", a number. So perhaps write it as the integer, but it's huge.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the answer in boxed notation? No, instructions are clear: put the exact value in quotes.\n\nGiven that, and that it's a math contest problem, the expected answer is \\binom{4020}{1005}^2, but as a string? Or maybe compute log? No.\n\nWait — perhaps I miscalculated the exponent.\n\nTarget is (2010, 2010), n = 4020.\n\nFrom (x + x^{-1})^n, coefficient of x^{2010} is C(n, (n - 2010)/2) = C(4020, (4020 - 2010)/2) = C(4020, 2010/2) = C(4020, 1005) — correct.\n\nSo answer is [C(4020, 1005)]².\n\nIn many online judges, they would accept this form, but here, since it says \"exact value\", and it's an integer, perhaps we write it as the product, but no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is simply 1? No, small case gave 16.\n\nI think we have to go with \\binom{4020}{1005}^2, and since JSON requires a string, and no LaTeX, perhaps write it as \"C(4020,1005)^2\" — but the example uses plain numbers.\n\nLooking back at problem statement: \"In how many ways...\", and it's a counting problem, so answer is that integer.\n\nBut given constraints, I think the expected answer is \\binom{4020}{1005}^2, and in the JSON, we write it as a string representation of that number — but it's too long.\n\nWait — perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternative idea: Since each move is (±1,±1), the ant's path is equivalent to choosing for each step a sign for x and a sign for y independently.\n\nThat is, each move corresponds to choosing dx = ±1 and dy = ±1 independently — 4 choices, yes.\n\nSo over 4020 steps, we choose a sequence of dx_i ∈ {±1}, dy_i ∈ {±1}, independently.\n\nThen final x = sum dx_i = 2010  \nFinal y = sum dy_i = 2010\n\nSince dx_i are independent of dy_i, the number of ways is [number of ways to get sum dx_i = 2010] × [number of ways to get sum dy_i = 2010]\n\nEach dx_i = ±1, sum of 4020 terms = 2010.\n\nLet p = number of +1s, m = number of −1s, p + m = 4020, p − m = 2010 ⇒ 2p = 6030 ⇒ p = 3015, m = 1005\n\nSo number of dx sequences = C(4020, 3015) = C(4020, 1005) (since C(n,k)=C(n,n−k))\n\nSame for dy.\n\nAnd since dx and dy choices are independent, total = C(4020, 1005) × C(4020, 1005) = [C(4020, 1005)]²\n\nYes, same result.\n\nSo confirmed.\n\nTherefore, answer_2 = \\binom{4020}{1005}^2\n\nIn JSON, since it must be a string without LaTeX, and the problem likely expects this form, but the instruction says \"exact value\", and in programming, sometimes they want the expression.\n\nBut given the example is \"42\", a number, and this is too big, perhaps the answer is to leave it as the binomial expression.\n\nHowever, standard practice in such problems is to box the expression, but here JSON requires a string.\n\nI think the intended answer is the integer, but since we can't compute it here, and the problem is from a contest, the answer is \\binom{4020}{1005}^2, and we'll write it as a string \"C(4020,1005)^2\" — but that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the number of ways as 1? No.\n\nWait — is there only one way? No, small case had 16.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 0? No.\n\nI think we have to go with the mathematical answer: [C(4020, 1005)]²\n\nIn JSON, we can write it as a string representing the expression, but instructions say \"no explanations, no units unless part of the answer, no LaTeX formatting\", so \"binomial(4020,1005)^2\" is not allowed.\n\nBut \"42\" is fine. So perhaps the problem expects us to realize it's \\binom{4020}{1005}^2 and output that as a string without LaTeX — but how?\n\nMaybe just compute that it's equal to \\frac{4020!^2}{1005!^2 \\cdot 3015!^2}, but same issue.\n\nI think the expected answer is the expression \\binom{4020}{1005}^2, and in the JSON, we write it as a string \"C(4020,1005)^2\" — but let's see if there's another way.\n\nWait — perhaps the answer is simply \\binom{4020}{2010}, but no, small case: for (2,2) in 4 steps, that would be C(4,2)=6, but we got 16.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, I conclude answer_2 = \\binom{4020}{1005}^2\n\nSince we must output in JSON as a string, and no LaTeX, perhaps write it as \"(4020 choose 1005)^2\", but instructions say \"no explanations\".\n\nThe safest is to output the numerical value as a string, but it's infeasible.\n\nGiven that this is a reasoning exercise, and the problem is well-known, the answer is \\binom{4020}{1005}^2, and in many contexts, it's written as such.\n\nBut the instruction says \"put ONLY the answer value in the quotes\", and for numerical answers, \"exact value\". Since it's an integer, and huge, perhaps the problem expects the expression in terms of binomial coefficient, but formatted as text.\n\nI'll go with the standard way: write it as the square of the binomial coefficient, using the notation that is unambiguous.\n\nBut looking at similar problems, sometimes they accept \\dbinom{4020}{1005}^2, but no LaTeX.\n\nPerhaps just \"4020C1005^2\" — but not standard.\n\nGiven the constraints, and that the first answer is 0, a simple number, and second is huge, I think the intended answer is \\binom{4020}{1005}^2, and we'll represent it as a string \"C(4020,1005)^2\"\n\nBut let's check if 1005 is correct: n = 4020, target x = 2010, so number of +1 steps = (n + x)/2 = (4020 + 2010)/2 = 3015, so number of −1 steps = 1005, so C(4020, 3015) = C(4020, 1005), yes.\n\nSo answer is [C(4020, 1005)]²\n\nI'll write it as \"C(4020,1005)^2\" — but the instructions might expect the numeric string. Since it's impossible, and the problem is theoretical, I'll go with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 1? No.\n\nI think we should output the exact expression as a string.\n\nSo final answers:\n\nanswer_1 = \"0\"  \nanswer_2 = \"C(4020,1005)^2\"\n\nBut wait — the example has \"42\" without quotes in the description, but in JSON it's with quotes. So \"0\" and \"C(4020,1005)^2\" are strings.\n\nBut is \"C(4020,1005)^2\" acceptable? Perhaps not; maybe they want the number.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the number of ways is 0 because parity? No, 4020 even, 2010 even, ok.\n\nOr maybe it's impossible? No, we have solution.\n\nI think we have to go with the mathematical answer.\n\nSo:\n\nanswer_1 = \"0\"  \nanswer_2 = \"C(4020,1005)^2\"\n\nBut to comply with \"exact value\", and since it's an integer, perhaps write it as the product, but no.\n\nI'll proceed.\n\n---\n\nFinal reasoning summary:\n\nProblem 1: Committees must satisfy all constraints. Requiring Bill and Karl both excluded and Alice and Jane both included violates the \"Alice and Jane refuse to serve together\" constraint, so no such valid committee exists ⇒ k = 0.\n\nProblem 2: Each move changes x and y by ±1 independently. To reach (2010, 2010) in 4020 steps, need exactly 3015 steps with dx = +1 (so 1005 with dx = −1), and similarly 3015 with dy = +1. Since dx and dy choices are independent, number of ways is C(4020, 1005) for x-direction and same for y-direction, so total is [C(4020, 1005)]².\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The conditions require Bill and Karl to both be excluded and Alice and Jane to both be included. However, the problem states that Alice and Jane refuse to serve with each other, meaning no valid committee can include both. Thus, there are zero committees satisfying all constraints under these conditions. Problem 2: Each move changes x and y by ±1 independently. To reach (2010, 2010) in 4020 steps, the number of +1 steps in x must be (4020 + 2010)/2 = 3015, so the number of ways to choose which steps have dx = +1 is C(4020, 3015) = C(4020, 1005). Similarly for y. Since x and y choices are independent, the total number of paths is [C(4020, 1005)]².\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"C(4020,1005)^2\"\n}",
