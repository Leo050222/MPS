  "reasoning_content": "Let's solve each problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 1:**\n\n> The following image is 1024 pixels by 1024 pixels, and each pixel is either black or white. The border defines the boundaries of the image, but is not part of the image. Let $a$ be the proportion of pixels that are black. Estimate $A=\\lfloor 10000 a\\rfloor$. An estimate of $E$ will earn $\\left\\lfloor 20 \\min \\left(\\frac{A}{E}, \\frac{E}{A}\\right)^{12}\\right\\rfloor$ points. Instead of estimating the floored scaled proportion of black pixels, simply find $k = N - 1048572$, where $N$ is the total number of pixels.\n\nWe are told the image is **1024 pixels by 1024 pixels**, and each pixel is part of the image (the border is *not* part of the image — it just defines boundaries). So the total number of pixels $N = 1024 \\times 1024$.\n\nCompute:\n\n$$\n1024 \\times 1024 = 2^{10} \\times 2^{10} = 2^{20} = 1,\\!048,\\!576\n$$\n\nSo $N = 1,\\!048,\\!576$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nk = N - 1,\\!048,\\!572 = 1,\\!048,\\!576 - 1,\\!048,\\!572 = 4\n$$\n\nThat’s it. The rest about $a$, $A$, estimation, etc., is a red herring — the problem says: *\"Instead of estimating..., simply find $k = N - 1048572$\"*.\n\nSo answer to Problem 1 is **4**.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\n> The game of rock-scissors is played just like rock-paper-scissors, except that neither player is allowed to play paper. You play against a poorly-designed computer program that plays rock with 50% probability and scissors with 50% probability. If you play optimally against the computer, find the probability that after 8 games you have won at least 4.\n\nFirst, understand the rules of rock-scissors:\n\n- Only two moves: Rock (R) and Scissors (S)\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Rock? Wait — no! In standard RPS, Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock.\n\nBut here, paper is removed → only Rock and Scissors remain.\n\nSo what are the outcomes?\n\n- Rock vs Scissors → Rock wins\n- Scissors vs Rock → Rock wins (i.e., same as above — Scissors loses to Rock)\n- Rock vs Rock → tie\n- Scissors vs Scissors → tie\n\nSo only winning move is playing Rock when opponent plays Scissors, or playing Scissors when opponent plays Rock? Wait — hold on.\n\nWait: In standard RPS:\n- Rock crushes Scissors → Rock wins\n- Scissors cuts Paper → Scissors wins\n- Paper covers Rock → Paper wins\n\nSo if only Rock and Scissors are allowed, then:\n\n- Rock vs Scissors → Rock wins  \n- Scissors vs Rock → Scissors loses → Rock wins  \nSo Rock always beats Scissors.\n\nWhat about Scissors vs Scissors? Tie. Rock vs Rock? Tie.\n\nSo the only way to win is: you play Rock and opponent plays Scissors.\n\nThe only way opponent wins is: opponent plays Rock and you play Scissors.\n\nSo win/loss/tie matrix:\n\n| You \\ Opp | Rock (0.5) | Scissors (0.5) |\n|-----------|------------|----------------|\n| Rock      | tie        | **win**        |\n| Scissors  | **lose**   | tie            |\n\nSo if you choose Rock:\n- Win with prob 0.5 (when opp plays Scissors)\n- Tie with prob 0.5 (when opp plays Rock)\n\nIf you choose Scissors:\n- Lose with prob 0.5 (when opp plays Rock)\n- Tie with prob 0.5 (when opp plays Scissors)\n\nSo clearly, playing Rock gives you 50% chance to win, 50% tie → **no chance to lose**, and expected win rate = 0.5.\n\nPlaying Scissors gives 50% chance to lose, 50% tie → expected win rate = 0.\n\nSo optimal strategy is to **always play Rock**, giving you per-game:\n- P(win) = 0.5  \n- P(lose) = 0  \n- P(tie) = 0.5  \n\nWe play 8 independent games. In each, win with probability 0.5, else tie.\n\nWe want probability that you have **won at least 4 games** out of 8.\n\nSince each game is independent and win probability is 0.5, number of wins $W \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n=8, p=0.5)$.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nP(W \\ge 4) = \\sum_{k=4}^{8} \\binom{8}{k} (0.5)^8 = (0.5)^8 \\cdot \\sum_{k=4}^{8} \\binom{8}{k}\n$$\n\nCompute binomial coefficients:\n\n- $\\binom{8}{0} = 1$  \n- $\\binom{8}{1} = 8$  \n- $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$  \n- $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$  \n- $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$  \n- $\\binom{8}{5} = 56$  \n- $\\binom{8}{6} = 28$  \n- $\\binom{8}{7} = 8$  \n- $\\binom{8}{8} = 1$\n\nSum from k = 4 to 8:  \n70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = let's compute:\n\n70 + 56 = 126  \n126 + 28 = 154  \n154 + 8 = 162  \n162 + 1 = 163\n\nTotal sum of all binomial coefficients = $2^8 = 256$\n\nSo sum from 0 to 3 = 256 − 163 = 93  \nCheck: 1 + 8 + 28 + 56 = 93 ✔️\n\nSo $P(W \\ge 4) = \\frac{163}{256}$\n\nIs that reduced? 163 is prime? Let's check: 163 is not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11,13 → 13×12=156, 13×13=169 > 163 → yes, 163 is prime. 256 = 2⁸, so no common factor. So fraction is already reduced.\n\nSo answer is $\\frac{163}{256}$\n\nBut the problem says \"find the probability\", and doesn’t specify format — but since it's rational and exact, and 163/256 is exact, we can output as decimal? No — better to output exact fraction? But the instructions say: “For numerical answers, provide the exact value”. Fraction is exact.\n\nHowever, in many contest contexts, they expect reduced fraction, or sometimes decimal. But JSON value must be in quotes — and it's a number, so likely as string \"163/256\" or as decimal? Let's see instruction again:\n\n> For numerical answers, provide the exact value  \n> For text answers, provide the exact text  \n\n\"163/256\" is an exact representation; \"0.63671875\" is also exact decimal (since denominator is power of 2), but longer.\n\nBut the problem says \"find the probability\", and in math competitions, fractions are preferred for exactness.\n\nAlso, note that 163/256 = 0.63671875 exactly.\n\nBut the instruction says \"exact value\". Both are exact. However, since it's a rational number with small numerator/denominator, safest is to give as reduced fraction string.\n\nBut wait — look at example format: `\"answer_2\": \"Monday\"` — so strings are fine. And `\"answer_1\": \"4\"` — integer as string.\n\nSo `\"answer_2\": \"163/256\"` is acceptable.\n\nBut let’s double-check logic: Is always playing Rock truly optimal?\n\nAlternative: Could we mix strategies? Suppose we play Rock with probability $p$, Scissors with $1-p$.\n\nThen per-game win probability =\n\n- Win when: we play Rock & opp plays Scissors → $p \\cdot 0.5$  \n- Win when: we play Scissors & opp plays Rock → $(1-p) \\cdot 0.5$? No! That’s a loss.\n\nRecall:  \n- You Rock, opp Scissors → you win  \n- You Scissors, opp Rock → you lose  \n- You Rock, opp Rock → tie  \n- You Scissors, opp Scissors → tie  \n\nSo only one way to win: you Rock, opp Scissors → prob = $p \\cdot 0.5$  \nOnly one way to lose: you Scissors, opp Rock → prob = $(1-p) \\cdot 0.5$  \nTie otherwise.\n\nSo expected win probability = $0.5p$, which is maximized at $p = 1$, giving 0.5.\n\nSo yes, pure Rock is optimal. So wins ~ Binomial(8, 0.5), and P(W ≥ 4) = 163/256.\n\nThus answer is \"163/256\".\n\nBut wait — is there a possibility of “at least 4 wins” meaning strictly more than 4? No: “at least 4” means 4,5,6,7, or 8.\n\nYes, we included k = 4 to 8 → correct.\n\nSo final answers:\n\n- Problem 1: 4  \n- Problem 2: \"163/256\"\n\nNow format as JSON.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The image is 1024x1024 pixels, so total pixels N = 1024^2 = 2^20 = 1,048,576. Then k = N - 1,048,572 = 4. Problem 2: With only rock and scissors, rock beats scissors. The computer plays rock or scissors each with 0.5 probability. Optimal strategy is always play rock, giving 0.5 win probability per game, 0.5 tie. Number of wins in 8 games is Binomial(8, 0.5). P(at least 4 wins) = sum_{k=4 to 8} C(8,k) / 256 = (70+56+28+8+1)/256 = 163/256.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"163/256\"\n}",
