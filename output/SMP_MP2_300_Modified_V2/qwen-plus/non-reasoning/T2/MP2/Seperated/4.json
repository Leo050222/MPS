Brothers Michael and Kylo each select a positive integer less than or equal to $ N $, independently and uniformly at random. Let $ p_N $ denote the probability that the product of these two integers has a units digit of 0. The maximum possible value of $ p_N $ over all possible choices of $ N $ can be written as $ \\frac{a}{b} $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $ 100a + b $. Instead of computing one hundred times the numerator plus the denominator when the maximum possible value of $ p_N $ is expressed as a reduced fraction, simply find $ e = \\left(k + \\frac{1973}{100}\\right) $, where $ k $ is the maximum possible value of $ p_N $ derived from the upper bound analysis of the probability.\n\nWait — this wording is confusing. Let's parse carefully.\n\nIt says:\n\n- \"The maximum possible value of $ p_N $ over all possible choices of $ N $ can be written as $ \\frac{a}{b} $... Compute $ 100a + b $.\"\n\nThen it says: *\"Instead of computing one hundred times the numerator plus the denominator [...] simply find $ e = \\left(k + \\frac{1973}{100}\\right) $, where $ k $ is the maximum possible value of $ p_N $ derived from the upper bound analysis of the probability.\"*\n\nSo the problem is *not* asking for $ 100a + b $, but rather $ e = k + \\frac{1973}{100} $, where $ k = \\max_N p_N $.\n\nSo we need to compute $ \\max_N p_N $, call it $ k $, then compute $ k + \\frac{1973}{100} $.\n\nSo first, find $ \\max_N p_N $.\n\n---\n\n#### Understanding $ p_N $:\n\nMichael picks $ x \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,N\\} $, Kylo picks $ y \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,N\\} $, uniformly and independently.\n\nWe want $ \\Pr( xy \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10} ) $.\n\nUnits digit 0 ⇔ divisible by 10 ⇔ divisible by both 2 and 5.\n\nSo $ xy $ divisible by 10 iff at least one factor contributes a factor of 2 and at least one contributes a factor of 5.\n\nThat is, $ xy $ divisible by 10 iff:\n\n- $ x $ or $ y $ is even (i.e., divisible by 2), AND  \n- $ x $ or $ y $ is divisible by 5.\n\nBut careful: It's not enough that one is even and one is multiple of 5 — they could be the same number! Actually, the condition is:\n\n$ xy $ divisible by 10 ⇔ $ v_2(xy) \\ge 1 $ and $ v_5(xy) \\ge 1 $, i.e., total exponent of 2 in $ xy $ is ≥1, and same for 5.\n\nSo equivalently:\n\n- At least one of $ x,y $ is even (i.e., divisible by 2), AND  \n- At least one of $ x,y $ is divisible by 5.\n\nYes — because if both are odd, product is odd → not divisible by 2 → fails. If neither divisible by 5, product not divisible by 5 → fails.\n\nSo event $ A $: at least one even  \nEvent $ B $: at least one multiple of 5  \nWe want $ \\Pr(A \\cap B) = 1 - \\Pr(A^c \\cup B^c) = 1 - [\\Pr(A^c) + \\Pr(B^c) - \\Pr(A^c \\cap B^c)] $\n\nWhere:\n\n- $ A^c $: both odd ⇒ $ x $ and $ y $ odd  \n- $ B^c $: neither divisible by 5 ⇒ $ x \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}, y \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} $  \n- $ A^c \\cap B^c $: both odd AND neither divisible by 5.\n\nSo:\n\nLet:\n- $ o_N $ = number of odd integers in $ [1,N] $\n- $ f_N $ = number of integers in $ [1,N] $ not divisible by 5\n- $ of_N $ = number of integers in $ [1,N] $ that are odd AND not divisible by 5\n\nThen:\n\n- $ \\Pr(A^c) = \\left(\\frac{o_N}{N}\\right)^2 $\n- $ \\Pr(B^c) = \\left(\\frac{f_N}{N}\\right)^2 $\n- $ \\Pr(A^c \\cap B^c) = \\left(\\frac{of_N}{N}\\right)^2 $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\np_N = 1 - \\left(\\frac{o_N}{N}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{f_N}{N}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{of_N}{N}\\right)^2\n$$\n\nWe want to maximize $ p_N $ over positive integers $ N $.\n\nNote: Since only units digit matters, and divisibility by 2 and 5 depends only on residues mod 10, the behavior of $ p_N $ is periodic mod 10? Not exactly — because counts like $ o_N $ depend on floor division.\n\nBut as $ N \\to \\infty $, the density approaches limiting value:\n\n- Proportion odd → $ \\frac{1}{2} $\n- Proportion not divisible by 5 → $ \\frac{4}{5} $\n- Proportion odd and not divisible by 5 → among numbers mod 10, which residues are odd and not divisible by 5?\n\nResidues mod 10: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9  \nOdd ones: 1,3,5,7,9  \nAmong those, not divisible by 5: exclude 5 → so 1,3,7,9 → 4 out of 10 → proportion = $ \\frac{2}{5} $\n\nSo asymptotically:\n\n- $ \\frac{o_N}{N} \\to \\frac{1}{2} $\n- $ \\frac{f_N}{N} \\to \\frac{4}{5} $\n- $ \\frac{of_N}{N} \\to \\frac{2}{5} $\n\nThus asymptotic $ p_N \\to $\n\n$$\n1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{16}{25} + \\frac{4}{25}\n$$\n\nCompute:\n\n- $ \\frac{16}{25} - \\frac{4}{25} = \\frac{12}{25} $\n- So $ 1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{12}{25} = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{12}{25} $\n\nCommon denominator 100:\n\n- $ \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{75}{100} $, $ \\frac{12}{25} = \\frac{48}{100} $, so difference = $ \\frac{27}{100} = 0.27 $\n\nSo limit is $ \\frac{27}{100} = 0.27 $\n\nBut is this the *maximum*? Or can finite $ N $ give higher?\n\nLet’s test small $ N $.\n\nBut note: For small $ N $, proportions deviate. For example, if $ N = 10 $, exact counts:\n\n- Numbers 1–10:\n  - Odd: 1,3,5,7,9 → 5 → $ o_{10} = 5 $\n  - Not divisible by 5: exclude 5 and 10 → 8 numbers → $ f_{10} = 8 $\n  - Odd and not divisible by 5: exclude 5 → 1,3,7,9 → 4 → $ of_{10} = 4 $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\np_{10} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{10}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{8}{10}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{4}{10}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{25}{100} - \\frac{64}{100} + \\frac{16}{100} = \\frac{100 - 25 - 64 + 16}{100} = \\frac{27}{100}\n$$\n\nSame as limit.\n\nTry $ N = 5 $:\n\n- 1–5:\n  - Odd: 1,3,5 → 3\n  - Not divisible by 5: 1,2,3,4 → 4\n  - Odd and not divisible by 5: 1,3 → 2\n\nSo:\n\n$$\np_5 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{9}{25} - \\frac{16}{25} + \\frac{4}{25} = \\frac{25 - 9 - 16 + 4}{25} = \\frac{4}{25} = 0.16\n$$\n\nLess.\n\nTry $ N = 20 $:\n\n- Odd numbers: 10 → $ o = 10 $\n- Not divisible by 5: total 20, multiples of 5: 4 (5,10,15,20) → $ f = 16 $\n- Odd and not divisible by 5: odd numbers are 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19 → remove 5,15 → 8 left → $ of = 8 $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\np_{20} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{10}{20}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{16}{20}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{8}{20}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{64}{100} + \\frac{16}{100}\n$$\n\nConvert all to 100ths:\n\n- $ 1 = \\frac{100}{100} $\n- $ \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{25}{100} $\n- So $ \\frac{100 - 25 - 64 + 16}{100} = \\frac{27}{100} $ again.\n\nSo seems $ p_N = \\frac{27}{100} $ whenever $ N $ is multiple of 10? Let's verify $ N = 10m $.\n\nIn general, for $ N = 10m $:\n\n- Odd numbers: exactly $ 5m $ → $ o_N = 5m $\n- Multiples of 5: $ 2m $ (since every 5th number: 5,10,...,10m → $ \\frac{10m}{5} = 2m $) → not divisible by 5: $ 10m - 2m = 8m $ → $ f_N = 8m $\n- Odd and not divisible by 5: among odds 1,3,5,...,10m−1 (5m numbers), those divisible by 5 are numbers ≡ 5 mod 10 → positions: 5,15,25,...,10m−5 → how many? From 5 to 10m−5 step 10: $ \\frac{10m - 5 - 5}{10} + 1 = \\frac{10m - 10}{10} + 1 = m - 1 + 1 = m $. So $ m $ odds divisible by 5 → so odd and not divisible by 5: $ 5m - m = 4m $ → $ of_N = 4m $\n\nThen:\n\n$$\np_N = 1 - \\left(\\frac{5m}{10m}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{8m}{10m}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{4m}{10m}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{27}{100}\n$$\n\nSo for all $ N $ divisible by 10, $ p_N = \\frac{27}{100} $.\n\nWhat about $ N = 10m + r $, $ r = 1 $ to $ 9 $? Could $ p_N $ exceed $ \\frac{27}{100} $?\n\nLet’s try $ N = 9 $:\n\n- 1–9:\n  - Odd: 1,3,5,7,9 → 5\n  - Not divisible by 5: exclude 5 → 8\n  - Odd and not divisible by 5: 1,3,7,9 → 4\n\nSo same counts as $ N = 10 $ except denominator is 9.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\np_9 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{9}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{8}{9}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right)^2 = \\frac{81 - 25 - 64 + 16}{81} = \\frac{8}{81} \\approx 0.0988\n$$\n\nNo, wait: numerator: 81 − 25 = 56; 56 − 64 = −8; −8 + 16 = 8 → yes, $ \\frac{8}{81} \\approx 0.0988 $. Much smaller.\n\nTry $ N = 8 $:\n\n- Odds: 1,3,5,7 → 4\n- Not div by 5: 1–8 except 5 → 7\n- Odd & not div by 5: 1,3,7 → 3\n\nSo:\n\n$$\np_8 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{4}{8}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{7}{8}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{16}{64} - \\frac{49}{64} + \\frac{9}{64} = \\frac{64 - 16 - 49 + 9}{64} = \\frac{8}{64} = \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125\n$$\n\nStill less.\n\nTry $ N = 15 $:\n\n- Total = 15  \n- Odds: ceil(15/2) = 8? Wait: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15 → yes, 8  \n- Multiples of 5: 5,10,15 → 3 → not divisible by 5: 12  \n- Odd and not divisible by 5: from odds {1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15}, remove 5 and 15 → 6 left\n\nSo:\n\n$$\np_{15} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{8}{15}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{12}{15}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{6}{15}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{64}{225} - \\frac{144}{225} + \\frac{36}{225} = \\frac{225 - 64 - 144 + 36}{225} = \\frac{53}{225} \\approx 0.2356\n$$\n\nLess than 0.27.\n\nTry $ N = 25 $:\n\n- Odds: 13 (since 1–25 has 13 odds: (25+1)/2 = 13)\n- Multiples of 5: floor(25/5) = 5 → not divisible by 5: 20\n- Odd multiples of 5: numbers ≡ 5 mod 10 up to 25: 5,15,25 → 3 → so odd & not div by 5 = 13 − 3 = 10\n\nSo:\n\n$$\np_{25} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{13}{25}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{20}{25}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{10}{25}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{169}{625} - \\frac{400}{625} + \\frac{100}{625} = \\frac{625 - 169 - 400 + 100}{625} = \\frac{56}{625} = 0.0896??\n$$\n\nWait: 625 − 169 = 456; 456 − 400 = 56; 56 + 100 = 156 → oh! I misapplied sign: it's +100, so numerator = 625 − 169 − 400 + 100 = (625 + 100) − (169 + 400) = 725 − 569 = 156\n\nSo $ \\frac{156}{625} = 0.2496 $, still less than 0.27.\n\nSo far, $ \\frac{27}{100} = 0.27 $ is highest, achieved at $ N $ multiple of 10.\n\nCan it be higher? Let's consider maximizing expression:\n\n$$\np_N = 1 - \\left(\\frac{o}{N}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{f}{N}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{of}{N}\\right)^2\n$$\n\nLet $ a = o/N $, $ b = f/N $, $ c = of/N $. Note $ c \\le \\min(a,b) $, and also $ c \\ge a + b - 1 $ by inclusion-exclusion (since $ of = o + f - \\text{odd or div-by-5} $, but maybe not helpful).\n\nBut observe that function $ g(a,b,c) = 1 - a^2 - b^2 + c^2 $ is increasing in $ c $, decreasing in $ a $ and $ b $. So to maximize, want $ c $ as large as possible, $ a $ and $ b $ as small as possible.\n\nBut $ a = $ fraction odd → minimum possible is $ \\frac{1}{2} $ (approached as $ N $ large even), cannot go below $ \\frac{1}{2} $ for $ N \\ge 2 $, since at least half are odd.\n\nSimilarly, $ b = $ fraction not divisible by 5 → minimum is $ \\frac{4}{5} $, approached.\n\nAnd $ c = $ fraction odd and not divisible by 5 → maximum is $ \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4 $, as in mod 10 analysis.\n\nSo the supremum is $ 1 - (1/2)^2 - (4/5)^2 + (2/5)^2 = \\frac{27}{100} $, and it's attained when $ N $ is multiple of 10.\n\nHence $ \\max_N p_N = \\frac{27}{100} $. So $ k = \\frac{27}{100} $.\n\nThen $ e = k + \\frac{1973}{100} = \\frac{27 + 1973}{100} = \\frac{2000}{100} = 20 $.\n\nSo answer to Problem 1 is **20**.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> For how many ordered triplets $ (a, b, c) $ of positive integers less than 10 is the product $ a \\times b \\times c $ divisible by 20?\n\nPositive integers less than 10 ⇒ $ a,b,c \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\} $. So each has 9 possibilities ⇒ total triplets = $ 9^3 = 729 $.\n\nWe need count of ordered triplets where $ abc $ divisible by 20.\n\n20 = $ 2^2 \\cdot 5 $. So $ abc $ must have at least two factors of 2 and at least one factor of 5.\n\nSo conditions:\n\n- Among $ a,b,c $, total exponent of 2 ≥ 2  \n- Among $ a,b,c $, total exponent of 5 ≥ 1\n\nWe’ll use complementary counting? Or direct counting? Since domain is small (only numbers 1–9), we can categorize numbers by their 2-adic and 5-adic valuations.\n\nList numbers 1 through 9 with $ v_2 $ and $ v_5 $:\n\n| n | $ v_2(n) $ | $ v_5(n) $ |\n|---|-------------|-------------|\n| 1 | 0           | 0           |\n| 2 | 1           | 0           |\n| 3 | 0           | 0           |\n| 4 | 2           | 0           |\n| 5 | 0           | 1           |\n| 6 | 1           | 0           |\n| 7 | 0           | 0           |\n| 8 | 3           | 0           |\n| 9 | 0           | 0           |\n\nNote: 10 is excluded (since <10), so only one number with $ v_5 = 1 $: just 5. No number has $ v_5 \\ge 2 $.\n\nSo to get $ v_5(abc) \\ge 1 $, at least one of $ a,b,c $ must be 5.\n\nAlso need $ v_2(abc) \\ge 2 $. So sum of $ v_2 $'s across a,b,c ≥ 2.\n\nLet’s define:\n\nLet S = set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}\n\nLet’s partition S based on $ v_2 $:\n\n- $ v_2 = 0 $: numbers with no factor of 2 → odd numbers: 1,3,5,7,9 → 5 numbers  \n- $ v_2 = 1 $: divisible by 2 but not 4 → 2,6 → 2 numbers  \n- $ v_2 = 2 $: divisible by 4 but not 8 → 4 → 1 number  \n- $ v_2 = 3 $: divisible by 8 → 8 → 1 number  \n\nSo:\n\n- Type A (v2=0): {1,3,5,7,9} — size 5  \n- Type B (v2=1): {2,6} — size 2  \n- Type C (v2=2): {4} — size 1  \n- Type D (v2=3): {8} — size 1  \n\nAlso, only number with $ v_5 \\ge 1 $ is 5, which is in Type A.\n\nSo to satisfy both conditions:\n\n- At least one of a,b,c = 5 (to get factor of 5)  \n- Sum of $ v_2 $'s ≥ 2\n\nSo we need to count ordered triples (a,b,c) ∈ S³ such that:\n\n- At least one coordinate is 5  \n- Sum of $ v_2 $ values ≥ 2\n\nWe can do inclusion: fix positions of 5s, but perhaps easier to iterate over how many 5s, and for each, count ways to choose other numbers so total $ v_2 \\ge 2 $.\n\nLet’s define:\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- Let X be the multiset of $ v_2 $ contributions.\n\nBut maybe better: total number of triples with at least one 5 is:\n\nTotal with ≥1 five = total triples − triples with no 5 = $ 9^3 - 8^3 = 729 - 512 = 217 $\n\nBut among these 217, some have insufficient powers of 2.\n\nSo compute number of triples with at least one 5 AND total $ v_2 < 2 $, i.e., total $ v_2 = 0 $ or $ 1 $, then subtract from 217.\n\nSo desired = 217 − (# triples with ≥1 five AND $ v_2 $-sum = 0 or 1)\n\nSo compute:\n\nLet A = set of numbers with $ v_2 = 0 $: {1,3,5,7,9} — size 5  \nLet B = set with $ v_2 = 1 $: {2,6} — size 2  \nLet C = set with $ v_2 = 2 $: {4} — size 1  \nLet D = set with $ v_2 = 3 $: {8} — size 1  \n\nNote: Only 5 in A has $ v_5 = 1 $; others in A have $ v_5 = 0 $.\n\nSo to have at least one 5, and total $ v_2 \\in \\{0,1\\} $, we consider cases:\n\nCase 1: total $ v_2 = 0 $  \n⇒ all three numbers must be from A (since only A has $ v_2 = 0 $), and at least one is 5.\n\nA = {1,3,5,7,9}, size 5. Number of triples with all entries in A: $ 5^3 = 125 $. Among them, those with no 5: choose from {1,3,7,9} (size 4) → $ 4^3 = 64 $. So with at least one 5 and all in A: $ 125 - 64 = 61 $\n\nCase 2: total $ v_2 = 1 $  \nThis means sum of three $ v_2 $'s equals 1. Since each $ v_2 \\ge 0 $, the only way is: one of them has $ v_2 = 1 $, others have $ v_2 = 0 $. (Cannot have one with $ v_2 = 1 $, others 0; or one with $ v_2 = 1 $, rest 0 — yes.)\n\nSo pattern: exactly one coordinate has $ v_2 = 1 $ (i.e., is in B = {2,6}), and the other two have $ v_2 = 0 $ (i.e., in A), and overall at least one 5.\n\nSo count number of ordered triples where:\n\n- One position is from B (2 choices: 2 or 6),  \n- Other two positions are from A (5 choices each),  \n- And among the three numbers, at least one is 5.\n\nTotal such triples without 5 restriction:  \nChoose which position is B: 3 choices  \nValue at B-position: 2 choices (2 or 6)  \nValues at A-positions: 5 × 5 = 25  \nSo total = 3 × 2 × 25 = 150\n\nNow subtract those with *no 5*: then A-positions must be from A \\ {5} = {1,3,7,9}, size 4 ⇒ 4 × 4 = 16  \nSo no-5 triples = 3 × 2 × 16 = 96\n\nThus with at least one 5 = 150 − 96 = 54\n\nAre there other ways to get total $ v_2 = 1 $? Like one number with $ v_2 = 1 $, others 0 — yes, that's only way. Because min nonzero $ v_2 $ is 1, next is 2, etc. So no combination like 1+0+0 only.\n\nSo total \"bad\" triples (≥1 five but $ v_2 $-sum ≤ 1) = case1 + case2 = 61 + 54 = 115\n\nTherefore, good triples = 217 − 115 = **102**\n\nWait, let’s verify with alternative approach.\n\nAlternative: Direct count of triples with at least one 5 AND total $ v_2 \\ge 2 $.\n\nWe can break into cases based on how many 5s: 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut maybe our previous calculation is correct? Let's sanity check numbers.\n\nTotal with at least one 5: 217  \nWe found 61 with all $ v_2 = 0 $ (i.e., all from A, at least one 5)  \n54 with exactly one $ v_2 = 1 $, others $ v_2 = 0 $, at least one 5  \nSo 115 bad.\n\n217 − 115 = 102.\n\nLet’s test with brute-force reasoning on small scale? Maybe write down all combos? Not feasible manually, but let's spot-check.\n\nFor example, (5,4,1): v2 = 0 + 2 + 0 = 2, has 5 → valid  \n(5,2,1): v2 = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 → invalid  \n(5,2,2): v2 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 → valid  \n(5,5,1): v2 = 0+0+0 = 0 → invalid  \n(5,5,2): v2 = 0+0+1 = 1 → invalid  \n(5,5,4): v2 = 0+0+2 = 2 → valid  \n\nSo seems consistent.\n\nThus answer to Problem 2 is **102**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n- Problem 1: $ e = 20 $  \n- Problem 2: $ 102 $\n\nNow format JSON.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability p_N that the product of two independent uniform random integers from 1 to N has units digit 0 equals the probability that the product is divisible by 10, i.e., has at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 5. This occurs iff at least one number is even and at least one is divisible by 5. Using inclusion-exclusion, p_N = 1 - (o_N/N)^2 - (f_N/N)^2 + (of_N/N)^2, where o_N is count of odds, f_N count not divisible by 5, of_N count odd and not divisible by 5. As N increases, proportions approach 1/2, 4/5, and 2/5 respectively, giving limiting p_N = 27/100. This value is attained when N is a multiple of 10 (e.g., N=10,20), and no larger value is possible. Thus k = 27/100, and e = k + 1973/100 = 2000/100 = 20. Problem 2: Count ordered triplets (a,b,c) with each in {1,...,9} such that abc divisible by 20 = 2^2 * 5. Must have at least one 5 (only source of factor 5) and total v_2 >= 2. Total with at least one 5 is 9^3 - 8^3 = 217. Subtract those with at least one 5 but total v_2 <= 1: case v_2=0 (all from {1,3,5,7,9}, at least one 5) gives 61; case v_2=1 (exactly one from {2,6}, others from {1,3,5,7,9}, at least one 5) gives 54; total bad = 115. So good = 217 - 115 = 102.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"20\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"102\"\n}",
