  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve each step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> Define $\\varphi^{k}(n)$ as the number of positive integers that are less than or equal to $n / k$ and relatively prime to $n$. Find $\\varphi^{2001}\\left(2002^{2}-1\\right)$.

What is $f(2002)$?\n\nWe are told: For all positive integers $a, b, n$ with $a + b = 2^n$, it holds that $f(a) + f(b) = n^2$.\n\nWe need to find $f(2002)$. Since $f$ is defined on positive integers (as domain includes $a,b$ positive integers), and the condition relates values symmetrically around $2^n/2$, perhaps $f$ has a specific form.\n\nLet’s try to deduce $f(x)$.\n\nLet’s denote $S_n = \\{ (a,b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\times \\mathbb{Z}^+ : a + b = 2^n \\}$. For any such pair, $f(a) + f(b) = n^2$.\n\nThis resembles a functional equation with symmetry.\n\nA common trick: suppose $f(x) = g(\\log_2 x)$? Not obviously helpful.\n\nTry assuming $f(x)$ depends only on the smallest $n$ such that $x \\le 2^n$, i.e., the number of bits? Or maybe $f(x) = c \\cdot (\\text{something})$.\n\nBut better: try to find a consistent definition.\n\nLet’s try small $n$:\n\n- $n = 1$: $a + b = 2^1 = 2$. Positive integers ⇒ only $(1,1)$. So $f(1) + f(1) = 1^2 = 1$ ⇒ $2f(1) = 1$ ⇒ $f(1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n- $n = 2$: $a + b = 4$. Positive integer pairs: $(1,3), (2,2), (3,1)$. So:\n  - $f(1) + f(3) = 4$\n  - $f(2) + f(2) = 4$ ⇒ $2f(2) = 4$ ⇒ $f(2) = 2$\n  - Also $f(3) + f(1) = 4$, same as above.\n\nSince $f(1) = \\frac{1}{2}$, then $f(3) = 4 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5$\n\n- $n = 3$: $a + b = 8$. Pairs include $(1,7), (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2), (7,1)$\n\nThen:\n\n- $f(1) + f(7) = 9$ ⇒ $f(7) = 9 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{17}{2} = 8.5$\n- $f(2) + f(6) = 9$ ⇒ $f(6) = 9 - 2 = 7$\n- $f(3) + f(5) = 9$ ⇒ $f(5) = 9 - \\frac{7}{2} = \\frac{11}{2} = 5.5$\n- $f(4) + f(4) = 9$ ⇒ $2f(4) = 9$ ⇒ $f(4) = \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5$\n\nSo far:\n\n| x | f(x)   |\n|---|--------|\n| 1 | 0.5    |\n| 2 | 2      |\n| 3 | 3.5    |\n| 4 | 4.5    |\n| 5 | 5.5    |\n| 6 | 7      |\n| 7 | 8.5    |\n\nHmm, not obvious linear.\n\nWait: Let's list $x$ and $f(x)$:\n\n- $f(1) = \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $f(2) = 2 = \\frac{4}{2}$\n- $f(3) = \\frac{7}{2}$\n- $f(4) = \\frac{9}{2}$\n- $f(5) = \\frac{11}{2}$\n- $f(6) = \\frac{14}{2} = 7$\n- $f(7) = \\frac{17}{2}$\n\nNot clear.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe $f(x) = (\\log_2 x)^2$? No, $f(2) = 2$, but $(\\log_2 2)^2 = 1$.\n\nAnother idea: Try to define $f(x)$ in terms of the smallest $n$ such that $x \\le 2^n$, i.e., $n = \\lceil \\log_2 x \\rceil$. But $f(3)$: $\\lceil \\log_2 3 \\rceil = 2$, $2^2 = 4$, not matching.\n\nWait — notice that for any $x$, and for any $n$ such that $x < 2^n$, we can write $b = 2^n - x$, and then $f(x) + f(2^n - x) = n^2$.\n\nSo $f(x) = n^2 - f(2^n - x)$.\n\nThat’s a reflection identity.\n\nIf we could find an $n$ such that both $x$ and $2^n - x$ are “simple”, maybe we can recurse.\n\nWe want $f(2002)$. Let's find $n$ such that $2^n > 2002$, and preferably $2^n - 2002$ is small or known.\n\nCompute powers of 2:\n\n- $2^{10} = 1024$\n- $2^{11} = 2048$\n- $2^{12} = 4096$\n\nSo $2^{11} = 2048$, and $2048 - 2002 = 46$\n\nSo for $n = 11$, $a = 2002$, $b = 46$, and $f(2002) + f(46) = 11^2 = 121$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nf(2002) = 121 - f(46)\n$$\n\nNow need $f(46)$. Find $n$ such that $2^n > 46$: $2^6 = 64$, $64 - 46 = 18$, so $f(46) + f(18) = 6^2 = 36$ ⇒ $f(46) = 36 - f(18)$\n\nSo $f(2002) = 121 - (36 - f(18)) = 85 + f(18)$\n\nNow $f(18)$: $2^5 = 32$, $32 - 18 = 14$ ⇒ $f(18) + f(14) = 25$ ⇒ $f(18) = 25 - f(14)$\n\nSo $f(2002) = 85 + 25 - f(14) = 110 - f(14)$\n\n$f(14)$: $2^4 = 16$, $16 - 14 = 2$ ⇒ $f(14) + f(2) = 4^2 = 16$ ⇒ $f(14) = 16 - f(2) = 16 - 2 = 14$\n\nSo $f(2002) = 110 - 14 = 96$\n\nLet’s verify steps carefully:\n\n- $2^{11} = 2048$, $2048 - 2002 = 46$ → $f(2002) + f(46) = 121$ ✔  \n- $2^6 = 64$, $64 - 46 = 18$ → $f(46) + f(18) = 36$ ✔  \n- So $f(2002) = 121 - f(46) = 121 - (36 - f(18)) = 85 + f(18)$ ✔  \n- $2^5 = 32$, $32 - 18 = 14$ → $f(18) + f(14) = 25$ ⇒ $f(18) = 25 - f(14)$ ✔  \n- So $f(2002) = 85 + 25 - f(14) = 110 - f(14)$ ✔  \n- $2^4 = 16$, $16 - 14 = 2$ ⇒ $f(14) + f(2) = 16$, and earlier we found $f(2) = 2$ ⇒ $f(14) = 14$ ✔  \n- So $f(2002) = 110 - 14 = 96$\n\nDouble-check $f(2) = 2$: From $n = 2$, $a + b = 4$, pair $(2,2)$ gives $2f(2) = 4$ ⇒ $f(2) = 2$. Correct.\n\nAlso check $f(14)$: Is there another way to confirm? Let's see if $14$ can be expressed via other $n$.\n\n- $2^4 = 16$: done.\n- $2^5 = 32$: $32 - 14 = 18$, same as before.\n- $2^6 = 64$: $64 - 14 = 50$, unknown.\n\nSo consistent.\n\nThus $f(2002) = 96$\n\n✅ Answer to Problem 2 is **96**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We are told to compute q = gcd(m, k) + k, where k = 2001 and m = 2002 since the argument is 2002^2 - 1 = m^2 - 1. Since 2002 and 2001 are consecutive integers, gcd(2002, 2001) = 1, so q = 1 + 2001 = 2002. Problem 2: Using the functional equation f(a) + f(b) = n^2 when a + b = 2^n, we express f(2002) recursively: 2002 + 46 = 2048 = 2^11 ⇒ f(2002) = 121 - f(46). Then 46 + 18 = 64 = 2^6 ⇒ f(46) = 36 - f(18). Then 18 + 14 = 32 = 2^5 ⇒ f(18) = 25 - f(14). Then 14 + 2 = 16 = 2^4 ⇒ f(14) = 16 - f(2) = 16 - 2 = 14. Back-substituting: f(18) = 25 - 14 = 11, f(46) = 36 - 11 = 25, f(2002) = 121 - 25 = 96.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2002\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"96\"\n}",
