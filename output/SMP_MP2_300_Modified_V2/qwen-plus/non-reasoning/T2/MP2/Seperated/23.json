  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> Find all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of positive integers such that  \n> (i) $2a + 1 \\mid 3b - 1$, and  \n> (ii) $2b + 1 \\mid 3a - 1$.  \n> Instead of determining all such ordered pairs, simply find $k = b - 14$, where $(a, b)$ is the ordered pair satisfying the divisibility conditions in which the second component exceeds the first.\n\nSo we need to find **the** ordered pair $(a,b)$ with $b > a$, satisfying both divisibility conditions, and compute $k = b - 14$.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- $d_1 = 2a + 1$, so $d_1 \\mid 3b - 1$ ⇒ $3b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d_1}$\n- $d_2 = 2b + 1$, so $d_2 \\mid 3a - 1$ ⇒ $3a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d_2}$\n\nSince $a,b$ are positive integers, $d_1, d_2$ are odd integers ≥ 3.\n\nLet’s try small values.\n\nBecause the problem says “the ordered pair” (singular) where $b > a$, likely there is only one such pair satisfying the condition — or at least only one small one.\n\nTry small $a$, compute constraints on $b$.\n\n#### Try $a = 1$:  \nThen $2a + 1 = 3$, so $3 \\mid 3b - 1$ ⇒ $3b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ ⇒ $0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ → impossible.\n\n#### $a = 2$: $2a+1 = 5$. So $5 \\mid 3b - 1$ ⇒ $3b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod 5: $3^{-1} \\equiv 2$ (since $3·2 = 6 ≡ 1$), so $b ≡ 2 \\pmod{5}$. So $b = 2,7,12,17,...$\n\nAlso need $2b + 1 \\mid 3a - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5$. So $2b + 1$ divides 5. Since $2b + 1 ≥ 3$, possible divisors of 5 are 1 and 5; only possible is $2b + 1 = 5$ ⇒ $b = 2$. Check if $b > a$: $2 > 2$? No. So discard.\n\n#### $a = 3$: $2a+1 = 7$. So $7 \\mid 3b - 1$ ⇒ $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{7}$. Inverse of 3 mod 7 is 5 (3·5 = 15 ≡ 1), so $b ≡ 5 \\pmod{7}$. So $b = 5,12,19,...$\n\nAlso $2b + 1 \\mid 3a - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8$. So $2b + 1$ divides 8. Positive divisors of 8: 1,2,4,8. Since $2b + 1$ is odd and ≥ 3, only possible is $2b + 1 = 1$ (no), $= 8$? 8 is even → no. So only odd divisor ≥3 is 1 (too small) → none. So no solution.\n\n#### $a = 4$: $2a+1 = 9$. So $9 \\mid 3b - 1$ ⇒ $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{9}$. Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod 9? But gcd(3,9)=3, so 3 has no inverse mod 9. Equation $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{9}$ has solution only if 3 divides 1 → false. So no solution.\n\n#### $a = 5$: $2a+1 = 11$. So $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{11}$. Inverse of 3 mod 11 is 4 (3·4 = 12 ≡ 1), so $b ≡ 4 \\pmod{11}$. So $b = 4,15,26,...$\n\nAlso $2b + 1 \\mid 3a - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14$. Divisors of 14: 1,2,7,14. Odd ones ≥3: 7. So $2b + 1 = 7$ ⇒ $b = 3$. But $b ≡ 4 \\pmod{11}$, 3 ≠ 4 mod 11 → no.\n\n#### $a = 6$: $2a+1 = 13$. So $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{13}$. Inverse of 3 mod 13 is 9 (3·9 = 27 ≡ 1), so $b ≡ 9 \\pmod{13}$. So $b = 9,22,35,...$\n\nAlso $2b + 1 \\mid 3a - 1 = 18 - 1 = 17$, which is prime. Odd divisors ≥3: only 17. So $2b + 1 = 17$ ⇒ $b = 8$. But $b ≡ 9 \\pmod{13}$, 8 ≠ 9 → no.\n\n#### $a = 7$: $2a+1 = 15$. So $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{15}$. Again, gcd(3,15)=3 ∤ 1 → no solution.\n\n#### $a = 8$: $2a+1 = 17$. So $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{17}$. Inverse of 3 mod 17 is 6 (3·6 = 18 ≡ 1), so $b ≡ 6 \\pmod{17}$. So $b = 6,23,40,...$\n\nAlso $2b + 1 \\mid 3a - 1 = 24 - 1 = 23$, prime. So $2b + 1 = 23$ ⇒ $b = 11$. But 11 ≢ 6 mod 17 → no.\n\n#### $a = 9$: $2a+1 = 19$. So $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{19}$. Inverse of 3 mod 19 is 13 (3·13 = 39 ≡ 1), so $b ≡ 13 \\pmod{19}$. So $b = 13,32,...$\n\nAlso $2b + 1 \\mid 3a - 1 = 27 - 1 = 26$. Divisors of 26: 1,2,13,26. Odd ≥3: 13. So $2b + 1 = 13$ ⇒ $b = 6$, not ≡13 mod 19.\n\n#### $a = 10$: $2a+1 = 21$. $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{21}$. gcd(3,21)=3 ∤ 1 → no.\n\n#### $a = 11$: $2a+1 = 23$. So $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{23}$. Inverse of 3 mod 23 is 8 (3·8 = 24 ≡ 1), so $b ≡ 8 \\pmod{23}$. So $b = 8,31,...$\n\nAlso $2b + 1 \\mid 3a - 1 = 33 - 1 = 32$. Divisors of 32: powers of 2. Only odd divisor is 1 → no solution.\n\n#### $a = 12$: $2a+1 = 25$. $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{25}$. Inverse of 3 mod 25 is 17 (3·17 = 51 ≡ 1), so $b ≡ 17 \\pmod{25}$. So $b = 17,42,...$\n\nAlso $2b + 1 \\mid 3a - 1 = 36 - 1 = 35$. Divisors of 35: 1,5,7,35. Odd ≥3: 5,7,35.\n\nSo try:\n- $2b + 1 = 5$ ⇒ $b = 2$ → not 17 mod 25\n- $2b + 1 = 7$ ⇒ $b = 3$\n- $2b + 1 = 35$ ⇒ $b = 17$. Bingo! $b = 17$ satisfies $b ≡ 17 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nNow check if $b > a$: $17 > 12$ → yes.\n\nSo candidate: $(a,b) = (12,17)$\n\nCheck both conditions:\n\n- $2a + 1 = 25$, does $25 \\mid 3b - 1 = 51 - 1 = 50$? Yes, $50/25 = 2$.\n\n- $2b + 1 = 35$, does $35 \\mid 3a - 1 = 36 - 1 = 35$? Yes, $35/35 = 1$.\n\n✅ Works.\n\nIs this the only one with $b > a$? Let's see if any smaller $b > a$ works.\n\nWe found earlier:\n\n- $a = 2$, $b = 2$: not $b > a$\n\n- $a = 12$, $b = 17$: works.\n\nTry $a = 13$: $2a+1 = 27$. $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{27}$. gcd(3,27)=3 ∤ 1 → no.\n\n$a = 14$: $2a+1 = 29$. So $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{29}$. Inverse of 3 mod 29 is 10 (3·10 = 30 ≡ 1), so $b ≡ 10 \\pmod{29}$. So $b = 10,39,...$\n\nAlso $2b + 1 \\mid 3a - 1 = 42 - 1 = 41$, prime. So $2b + 1 = 41$ ⇒ $b = 20$. But 20 ≢ 10 mod 29 → no.\n\n$a = 15$: $2a+1 = 31$. $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{31}$. Inverse of 3 mod 31 is 21 (3·21 = 63 ≡ 1), so $b ≡ 21 \\pmod{31}$. So $b = 21,52,...$\n\nAlso $2b + 1 \\mid 45 - 1 = 44$. Divisors of 44: 1,2,4,11,22,44. Odd ≥3: 11. So $2b + 1 = 11$ ⇒ $b = 5$ → no.\n\n$a = 16$: $2a+1 = 33$, gcd(3,33)=3 ∤ 1 → no.\n\n$a = 17$: $2a+1 = 35$. So $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{35}$. Solve: need $3b = 35k + 1$. Try k = 1 → 36 → b = 12. k = 2 → 71 → not divisible by 3. k = 4 → 141 → b = 47. So b ≡ ? mod 35.\n\nBut also $2b + 1 \\mid 3a - 1 = 51 - 1 = 50$. Divisors of 50: 1,2,5,10,25,50. Odd ≥3: 5,25.\n\n- $2b + 1 = 5$ ⇒ $b = 2$\n\n- $2b + 1 = 25$ ⇒ $b = 12$\n\nCheck if $b = 12$ satisfies $3b ≡ 1 \\pmod{35}$: $3·12 = 36 ≡ 1 \\pmod{35}$ → yes! So $(a,b) = (17,12)$, but then $b < a$, so not our case.\n\nSo far only $(12,17)$ satisfies $b > a$.\n\nThus $k = b - 14 = 17 - 14 = 3$.\n\n✅ Answer for Problem 1: **3**\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> Meghana writes two (not necessarily distinct) primes $q$ and $r$ in base 10 next to each other on a blackboard, resulting in the concatenation of $q$ and $r$ (e.g., $q = 13$, $r = 5$ → number is 135). She notices that three more than the resulting number is the square of a prime $p$. Find all possible values of $p$.\n\nSo: Let $q,r$ be primes (could be same), concatenate decimal representations → call that number $N$. Then $N + 3 = p^2$, where $p$ is prime.\n\nWe need to find all possible $p$ such that $p^2 - 3$ is a concatenation of two primes.\n\nLet’s formalize concatenation:\n\nIf $q$ has $d$ digits, then concatenating $q$ and $r$ gives $N = q \\cdot 10^{\\text{digits}(r)} + r$.\n\nSo $N = q \\cdot 10^{\\ell} + r$, where $\\ell = \\lfloor \\log_{10} r \\rfloor + 1$, i.e., number of digits of $r$.\n\nSimilarly, could be $r$ concatenated with $q$, but problem says “writes two primes $q$ and $r$ next to each other”, i.e., order matters: first $q$, then $r$. So $N = \\text{concat}(q,r)$.\n\nWe need $p^2 = N + 3 = q \\cdot 10^{\\ell} + r + 3$, where $q,r$ are primes.\n\nSince $p^2$ must be > 3, $p ≥ 2$. Try small primes $p$, compute $p^2 - 3$, and check if it can be written as concatenation of two primes.\n\nList small primes $p$: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,...\n\nCompute $p^2 - 3$:\n\n- $p = 2$: $4 - 3 = 1$ → can’t be concatenation of two primes (needs at least 2 digits? smallest prime is 2, so smallest concatenation is \"2\"+\"2\" = 22. So 1 too small.)\n\n- $p = 3$: $9 - 3 = 6$ → single digit → no.\n\n- $p = 5$: $25 - 3 = 22$. Can 22 be split into two primes concatenated? Possible splits: \"2\"+\"2\" → both primes → yes! $q = 2$, $r = 2$. So $p = 5$ works.\n\n- $p = 7$: $49 - 3 = 46$. Splits: \"4\"+\"6\" → 4 not prime; \"46\" → can't split into two nonempty parts unless two-digit number → only split is \"4\" and \"6\", neither prime. So no.\n\n- $p = 11$: $121 - 3 = 118$. Digits = 3 → possible splits: \"1\"+\"18\", \"11\"+\"8\". Check:\n  - \"1\" not prime.\n  - \"11\" is prime, \"8\" not prime.\n  So no.\n\n- $p = 13$: $169 - 3 = 166$. Splits: \"1\"+\"66\", \"16\"+\"6\" → 1 not prime, 16 not prime, 6 not prime.\n\n- $p = 17$: $289 - 3 = 286$. Splits: \"2\"+\"86\", \"28\"+\"6\". \"2\" is prime, \"86\" not prime. \"28\" not prime.\n\n- $p = 19$: $361 - 3 = 358$. Splits: \"3\"+\"58\", \"35\"+\"8\". \"3\" prime, \"58\" not prime (58 = 2×29). \"35\" not prime.\n\n- $p = 23$: $529 - 3 = 526$. Splits: \"5\"+\"26\", \"52\"+\"6\". \"5\" prime, \"26\" not prime.\n\n- $p = 29$: $841 - 3 = 838$. Splits: \"8\"+\"38\", \"83\"+\"8\". \"8\" not prime, \"83\" is prime, \"8\" not prime.\n\n- $p = 31$: $961 - 3 = 958$. \"9\"+\"58\", \"95\"+\"8\": 9 not prime, 95 not prime.\n\n- $p = 37$: $1369 - 3 = 1366$. 4-digit → splits: \"1\"+\"366\", \"13\"+\"66\", \"136\"+\"6\". \"1\" no; \"13\" prime, \"66\" no; \"136\" no.\n\n- $p = 41$: $1681 - 3 = 1678$. Splits: \"1\"+\"678\", \"16\"+\"78\", \"167\"+\"8\". \"167\" is prime? Yes, 167 is prime. \"8\" not prime.\n\n- $p = 43$: $1849 - 3 = 1846$. Splits: \"1\"+\"846\", \"18\"+\"46\", \"184\"+\"6\" → none work.\n\n- $p = 47$: $2209 - 3 = 2206$. Splits: \"2\"+\"206\", \"22\"+\"06\", \"220\"+\"6\". \"2\" prime, \"206\" = 2×103 → not prime.\n\n- $p = 53$: $2809 - 3 = 2806$. \"2\"+\"806\", \"28\"+\"06\", \"280\"+\"6\" → \"2\" prime, \"806\" even >2 → no.\n\nWait — maybe try other way: instead of iterating $p$, iterate small primes $q,r$, compute $N = \\text{concat}(q,r)$, then check if $N + 3$ is square of prime.\n\nPrimes ≤ 100: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97.\n\nStart with 1-digit primes: 2,3,5,7.\n\nConcatenations of two 1-digit primes: 22,23,25,27,32,33,35,37,52,53,55,57,72,73,75,77.\n\nNow add 3 and test if perfect square and square root is prime.\n\n- 22 + 3 = 25 = 5² → p = 5 ✅\n\n- 23 + 3 = 26 → not square\n\n- 25 + 3 = 28\n\n- 27 + 3 = 30\n\n- 32 + 3 = 35\n\n- 33 + 3 = 36 = 6² → 6 not prime\n\n- 35 + 3 = 38\n\n- 37 + 3 = 40\n\n- 52 + 3 = 55\n\n- 53 + 3 = 56\n\n- 55 + 3 = 58\n\n- 57 + 3 = 60\n\n- 72 + 3 = 75\n\n- 73 + 3 = 76\n\n- 75 + 3 = 78\n\n- 77 + 3 = 80\n\nSo only 22 works among 1-digit+1-digit.\n\nNow try 1-digit + 2-digit primes.\n\nq ∈ {2,3,5,7}, r ∈ {11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97}\n\nThen N = q*100 + r (since r has 2 digits)\n\nSo N + 3 = q*100 + r + 3\n\nWe want this to be p².\n\nSo p² ∈ [200 + 11 + 3 = 214, 700 + 97 + 3 = 800] → p ∈ [15,28], since 15² = 225, 28² = 784, 29² = 841 > 800.\n\nSo check p from 15 to 28, but only prime p: 17,19,23.\n\n- p = 17: p² = 289 → N = 286. Can 286 be written as concat(q,r) with q prime (1-digit), r prime (2-digit)? Then q = first digit = 2, r = 86 → 86 not prime.\n\n- p = 19: 361 → N = 358 → q = 3, r = 58 → not prime.\n\n- p = 23: 529 → N = 526 → q = 5, r = 26 → not prime.\n\nWhat about q = 2-digit, r = 1-digit? The problem says \"writes two primes q and r next to each other\", doesn’t specify order, but says \"concatenation of q and r\", and example is q=13, r=5 → 135, i.e., q first. So q can be multi-digit.\n\nSo consider q 2-digit, r 1-digit: N = q*10 + r.\n\nq ∈ {11,13,...,97}, r ∈ {2,3,5,7}\n\nSo N ∈ [11*10 + 2 = 112, 97*10 + 7 = 977]\n\nSo p² = N + 3 ∈ [115, 980] → p up to floor(sqrt(980)) ≈ 31.3 → p ≤ 31.\n\nPrimes p: 11,13,17,19,23,29,31\n\nCompute p² - 3 and see if it ends with digit 2,3,5,7 (since r is 1-digit prime), and first part (remove last digit) is prime.\n\nSo for each p, compute M = p² - 3, check if last digit ∈ {2,3,5,7}, and floor(M/10) is prime.\n\n- p = 11: 121 - 3 = 118 → ends with 8 → no\n\n- p = 13: 169 - 3 = 166 → ends 6 → no\n\n- p = 17: 289 - 3 = 286 → ends 6\n\n- p = 19: 361 - 3 = 358 → 8\n\n- p = 23: 529 - 3 = 526 → 6\n\n- p = 29: 841 - 3 = 838 → 8\n\n- p = 31: 961 - 3 = 958 → 8\n\nAll end with even digit or 5? Wait 25 - 3 = 22 ends with 2 → worked.\n\nWhat about p = 37: 1369 - 3 = 1366 → ends 6\n\np = 41: 1681 - 3 = 1678 → 8\n\np = 43: 1849 - 3 = 1846 → 6\n\np = 47: 2209 - 3 = 2206 → 6\n\np = 53: 2809 - 3 = 2806 → 6\n\nAll even endings? Because p odd ⇒ p² odd ⇒ p² - 3 even ⇒ N even ⇒ last digit even or 5? Wait, even numbers end with 0,2,4,6,8. Primes ending digit can be 2 or 5 only for single-digit; otherwise primes > 5 end with 1,3,7,9. So if r is single-digit prime, r ∈ {2,3,5,7}, so N = q*10 + r ends with r, so N ends with 2,3,5,7 ⇒ N is odd except when r = 2. So N can be even only if r = 2.\n\nSo p² = N + 3 ⇒ if r = 2, N even ⇒ p² odd ⇒ ok. So possible.\n\nSo for r = 2, N ends with 2 ⇒ p² ends with 5 ⇒ p ends with 5 ⇒ p = 5 is only prime ending with 5. Indeed p = 5 gave N = 22.\n\nAny other p ending with 5? Only p = 5, since all others divisible by 5.\n\nSo only possible p ending with 5 is p = 5.\n\nThus only possible case where r = 2 is p = 5.\n\nWhat if r = 5? Then N ends with 5 ⇒ N divisible by 5 ⇒ N + 3 ≡ 3 mod 5 ⇒ p² ≡ 3 mod 5. But quadratic residues mod 5 are 0,1,4. So 3 is not a quadratic residue mod 5 ⇒ impossible. So r cannot be 5.\n\nIf r = 3: N ends with 3 ⇒ N ≡ 3 mod 10 ⇒ p² = N + 3 ≡ 6 mod 10. But squares mod 10 are 0,1,4,5,6,9. 6 is possible (e.g., 4² = 16, 6² = 36). So possible.\n\nSimilarly r = 7 ⇒ N ends 7 ⇒ p² ends 0 ⇒ p ends 0 ⇒ p = 10, not prime. So r = 7 impossible.\n\nSo only possible r values: 2,3.\n\nWe already have r = 2 → p = 5.\n\nNow try r = 3.\n\nThen N ends with 3 ⇒ p² ends with 6 ⇒ p ends with 4 or 6. But p prime > 2 must be odd ⇒ p ends with ... wait, 4 and 6 are even ⇒ only possible if p = 2, but 2² = 4, 4 - 3 = 1, not ending with 3. Contradiction? Wait p² ends with 6 ⇒ p must end with 4 or 6, but those are even ⇒ only even prime is 2, 2² = 4, not ending with 6. So no odd prime squared ends with 6? Wait 4² = 16, but 4 not prime. 14² = 196, 14 not prime. So no prime p > 2 ends with even digit, so p² for odd p ends with 1,5,9, or (if p ends 1→1, 3→9, 5→5, 7→9, 9→1). So squares of odd primes end with 1,5,9. So p² ends with 6 is impossible for prime p > 2. So r = 3 impossible.\n\nSimilarly r = 7 ⇒ p² ends with 0 ⇒ p ends with 0 ⇒ p = 10, not prime.\n\nSo only possible r is 2 or 5, but r = 5 impossible mod 5, so only r = 2.\n\nThus only possibility is N ends with 2 ⇒ p² ends with 5 ⇒ p = 5.\n\nBut wait — what if q = 2, r = 2 → N = 22, works.\n\nAre there other possibilities where r = 2 and q has more digits?\n\nSay q = 11, r = 2 → N = 112, N + 3 = 115 = not square.\n\nq = 13, r = 2 → 132 + 3 = 135\n\nq = 17, r = 2 → 172 + 3 = 175\n\nq = 19, r = 2 → 192 + 3 = 195\n\nq = 23, r = 2 → 232 + 3 = 235\n\nNone are squares.\n\nWhat about q = 101? But then N large; p² = N + 3 would be huge. But maybe there's another small one.\n\nWait earlier we had p = 5 gives 25, N = 22.\n\nIs there p = 7? 49 - 3 = 46 → can 46 be split as \"4\"+\"6\"? No. Or \"46\" itself? Need two primes concatenated, so must split into two non-empty parts. So 46 must be split after first digit: only \"4\" and \"6\", both not prime.\n\nWhat about three-digit N? Say N = 101, then p² = 104, not square.\n\nTry N = 112 → 115\n\nWait maybe q = 2, r = 2 is only solution.\n\nBut problem says \"find all possible values of p\". So far only p = 5.\n\nWait double-check p = 2: 4 - 3 = 1 → can't split.\n\np = 3: 9 - 3 = 6 → no.\n\np = 5: 25 - 3 = 22 = \"2\"+\"2\" → works.\n\np = 7: 49 - 3 = 46 → no.\n\np = 11: 121 - 3 = 118 → splits: \"1\"+\"18\", \"11\"+\"8\". \"11\" prime, \"8\" not.\n\np = 13: 169 - 3 = 166 → \"16\"+\"6\", \"1\"+\"66\"\n\np = 17: 289 - 3 = 286 → \"2\"+\"86\", \"28\"+\"6\"\n\np = 19: 361 - 3 = 358 → \"3\"+\"58\", \"35\"+\"8\"\n\np = 23: 529 - 3 = 526 → \"5\"+\"26\", \"52\"+\"6\"\n\np = 29: 841 - 3 = 838 → \"8\"+\"38\", \"83\"+\"8\" → \"83\" prime, \"8\" not.\n\np = 31: 961 - 3 = 958 → \"9\"+\"58\", \"95\"+\"8\"\n\np = 37: 1369 - 3 = 1366 → \"1\"+\"366\", \"13\"+\"66\", \"136\"+\"6\" → \"13\" prime, \"66\" not.\n\np = 41: 1681 - 3 = 1678 → \"16\"+\"78\", \"167\"+\"8\" → \"167\" prime, \"8\" not.\n\np = 43: 1849 - 3 = 1846 → \"18\"+\"46\", \"184\"+\"6\"\n\np = 47: 2209 - 3 = 2206 → \"2\"+\"206\", \"22\"+\"06\", \"220\"+\"6\"\n\np = 53: 2809 - 3 = 2806 → same issue.\n\nWhat if r = 2 and q = 22? But 22 not prime.\n\nOr q = 2, r = 22? But r must be prime, 22 not prime.\n\nSo only possibility is q = 2, r = 2 → N = 22 → p = 5.\n\nBut wait — what about q = 2, r = 23? Then N = 223, N + 3 = 226, not square.\n\nq = 2, r = 29 → 229 + 3 = 232\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe q = 23, r = 2 → 232 + 3 = 235\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps q = 3, r = 2 → 32 + 3 = 35\n\nNo.\n\nWait — what about q = 5, r = 2 → 52 + 3 = 55\n\nNo.\n\nSo seems only solution is p = 5.\n\nBut problem says \"find all possible values of p\", plural? Maybe there's another.\n\nTry p = 73: 73² = 5329, minus 3 = 5326. Can this be concatenation? Ends with 6 → r would have to be 6, not prime.\n\np = 97: 9409 - 3 = 9406 → ends 6.\n\nAll p odd > 5 give p² ≡ 1 or 9 mod 10 ⇒ p² - 3 ≡ 8 or 6 mod 10 ⇒ ends with 6 or 8 ⇒ r would be 6 or 8, not prime.\n\nOnly p = 5 gives p² = 25 ⇒ ends with 5 ⇒ p² - 3 = 22 ⇒ ends with 2 ⇒ r = 2, valid.\n\nThus only possible p is 5.\n\n✅ Answer for Problem 2: **5**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We searched for positive integer solutions (a,b) with b > a satisfying 2a+1 | 3b-1 and 2b+1 | 3a-1. Testing small values, the only pair found is (a,b) = (12,17), which satisfies both conditions: 2*12+1 = 25 divides 3*17-1 = 50, and 2*17+1 = 35 divides 3*12-1 = 35. Thus k = b - 14 = 17 - 14 = 3. Problem 2: We need p prime such that p^2 - 3 is the concatenation of two primes q and r. Testing small p, only p = 5 yields p^2 - 3 = 22, which is the concatenation of primes q = 2 and r = 2. All other p yield p^2 - 3 ending in digits incompatible with r being a prime (since r must be 2,3,5,7, but only r = 2 leads to p^2 ending in 5, forcing p = 5). Hence the only possible p is 5.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"5\"\n}",
