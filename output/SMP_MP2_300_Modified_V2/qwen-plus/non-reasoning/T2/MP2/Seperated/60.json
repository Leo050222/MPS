Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> After walking so much that his feet get really tired, the beaver staggers so that, at each step, his coordinates change by either $(+1,+1)$ or $(+1,-1)$. Now he walks from $(0,0)$ to $(8,0)$ without ever going below the $x$-axis. How many such paths are there? Instead of counting the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,0) that never go below the x-axis, simply find $k = m - 49$, where $m$ is the number of lattice paths from $(0,-2)$ to $(8,0)$ using steps of $(+1,+1)$ or $(+1,-1)$ derived from the reflection principle to count paths that violate the non-negativity condition.\n\nLet’s parse this carefully.\n\nThe beaver moves in steps: each step increases $x$ by 1, and $y$ changes by $+1$ or $-1$. So it's like Dyck path steps: up-right or down-right — i.e., like a 1D simple symmetric random walk projected onto the plane with time as x-coordinate.\n\nFrom $(0,0)$ to $(8,0)$: total steps = 8 (since x increases by 1 per step). To end at y=0, number of up steps (+1 in y) must equal number of down steps (−1 in y). So we need 4 ups and 4 downs.\n\nTotal unrestricted paths from (0,0) to (8,0): $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$.\n\nBut we want only those that **never go below the x-axis**, i.e., $y \\ge 0$ for all intermediate points (including start). These are Dyck paths of length 8 (i.e., 4 up, 4 down), which are counted by the **Catalan number** $C_4 = \\frac{1}{5}\\binom{8}{4} = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 70 = 14$.\n\nBut the problem says: *Instead of counting the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,0) that never go below the x-axis*, compute $k = m - 49$, where $m$ is the number of lattice paths from $(0,-2)$ to $(8,0)$ using same steps.\n\nSo they’re telling us to use the **reflection principle**, and define $m$ as number of paths from $(0,-2)$ to $(8,0)$. Then subtract 49.\n\nLet’s compute $m$: number of paths from $(0,-2)$ to $(8,0)$ using steps $(+1,+1)$ and $(+1,-1)$.\n\nEach step changes $x$ by +1, so again exactly 8 steps.\n\nLet $u$ = number of up steps $(+1,+1)$, $d$ = number of down steps $(+1,-1)$. Then:\n\n- $u + d = 8$\n- Net change in $y$: $u \\cdot (+1) + d \\cdot (-1) = u - d = \\text{final } y - \\text{initial } y = 0 - (-2) = +2$\n\nSo:\n- $u + d = 8$\n- $u - d = 2$\n\nAdd: $2u = 10 \\Rightarrow u = 5$, $d = 3$\n\nSo number of such paths is $\\binom{8}{5} = \\binom{8}{3} = 56$\n\nThus $m = 56$\n\nThen $k = m - 49 = 56 - 49 = 7$\n\nWait — but why is this relevant? Let's verify if this matches reflection principle logic.\n\nIn reflection principle for Dyck paths: number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(2n,0)$ that **touch or go below** the x-axis equals number of unrestricted paths from $(0,-2)$ to $(2n,0)$. Why?\n\nStandard reflection principle: To count paths from A to B that touch or cross a boundary (e.g., y = -1), reflect the starting point across the boundary.\n\nHere, “never go below x-axis” means $y \\ge 0$ always → violation means $y \\le -1$ at some point.\n\nThe standard trick for paths from $(0,0)$ to $(2n,0)$ that **go below 0** (i.e., reach $y = -1$) is to reflect the part before first hitting $y = -1$ across line $y = -1$, mapping start point $(0,0)$ to $(0,-2)$. So number of bad paths = number of unrestricted paths from $(0,-2)$ to $(2n,0)$. That’s exactly what’s described.\n\nSo for $n = 4$, total paths = $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$, bad paths = $m = 56$, so good paths = $70 - 56 = 14$, which matches Catalan $C_4 = 14$. So yes, $m = 56$.\n\nThen $k = m - 49 = 56 - 49 = 7$\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **7**\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> How many multiples of 7 between $10^{6}$ and $10^{9}$ are perfect squares?\n\nWe want integers $n$ such that:\n\n- $n$ is a perfect square: $n = k^2$ for some integer $k$\n- $n$ is divisible by 7 ⇒ $7 \\mid k^2$ ⇒ since 7 is prime, $7 \\mid k$, so $k = 7m$ for some integer $m$\n- So $n = (7m)^2 = 49 m^2$\n\nSo $n$ must be of the form $49 m^2$, and satisfy:\n\n$$\n10^6 \\le 49 m^2 \\le 10^9\n$$\n\nDivide by 49:\n\n$$\n\\frac{10^6}{49} \\le m^2 \\le \\frac{10^9}{49}\n$$\n\nTake square roots:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{10^6}{49}} \\le m \\le \\sqrt{\\frac{10^9}{49}}\n$$\n\nCompute:\n\n- $\\sqrt{10^6} = 10^3 = 1000$, so $\\sqrt{10^6 / 49} = \\frac{1000}{7} \\approx 142.857...$\n- $\\sqrt{10^9} = 10^{4.5} = 10^4 \\cdot \\sqrt{10} \\approx 10000 \\cdot 3.16227766 \\approx 31622.7766$, so $\\sqrt{10^9 / 49} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10^9}}{7} \\approx \\frac{31622.7766}{7} \\approx 4517.5395$\n\nSo $m$ must be integer satisfying:\n\n$$\n\\left\\lceil \\frac{1000}{7} \\right\\rceil \\le m \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\sqrt{10^9}}{7} \\right\\rfloor\n$$\n\nCompute exactly:\n\n- $10^6 = 1{,}000{,}000$, $10^9 = 1{,}000{,}000{,}000$\n\nWe need integer $m$ such that:\n\n$$\n49 m^2 \\in [10^6, 10^9]\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n- Lower bound: $49 m^2 \\ge 10^6 \\Rightarrow m^2 \\ge \\lceil 10^6 / 49 \\rceil$\n\nCompute $10^6 / 49$:\n\n$49 \\times 20408 = 49 \\times 20000 = 980000$, $49 \\times 408 = 49 \\times 400 = 19600$, $49 \\times 8 = 392$, so $49 \\times 408 = 19600 + 392 = 19992$, total $980000 + 19992 = 999992$. So $49 \\times 20408 = 999992$, then $49 \\times 20409 = 999992 + 49 = 1{,}000{,}041 > 10^6$. So smallest $m^2$ such that $49 m^2 \\ge 10^6$ is $m^2 \\ge 20409$? Wait no — careful.\n\nWe have $49 m^2 \\ge 10^6 \\Rightarrow m^2 \\ge \\frac{10^6}{49} \\approx 20408.163265...$, so smallest integer $m^2$ is $20409$, but $m$ itself must be integer, so we need smallest integer $m$ such that $m \\ge \\sqrt{10^6 / 49} = 1000/7 \\approx 142.857$, so $m_{\\min} = 143$\n\nCheck: $m = 143 \\Rightarrow n = 49 \\times 143^2$\n\nCompute $143^2 = (140 + 3)^2 = 19600 + 2\\cdot140\\cdot3 + 9 = 19600 + 840 + 9 = 20449$, then $49 \\times 20449 = ?$\n\nBut we don’t need to compute n; just ensure $49 \\times 143^2 \\ge 10^6$: Since $143 > 1000/7$, yes.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound: $49 m^2 \\le 10^9 \\Rightarrow m^2 \\le 10^9 / 49 \\approx 20{,}408{,}163.265...$, so $m \\le \\lfloor \\sqrt{10^9 / 49} \\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10^{4.5}}{7} \\right\\rfloor$\n\nCompute $\\sqrt{10^9} = \\sqrt{1{,}000{,}000{,}000} = 31{,}622.7766...$, divide by 7: $31{,}622.7766 / 7 \\approx 4517.5395$, so floor is 4517.\n\nSo $m$ ranges from 143 to 4517 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers = $4517 - 143 + 1 = 4517 - 142 = 4375$\n\nWait: $4517 - 143 = 4374$, plus 1 = **4375**\n\nLet’s double-check bounds.\n\n- $m_{\\min} = \\lceil 1000/7 \\rceil = \\lceil 142.857... \\rceil = 143$ ✅\n\n- $m_{\\max} = \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{10^9 / 49} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\sqrt{10^9}}{7} \\right\\rfloor$\n\nCompute $\\sqrt{10^9} = \\sqrt{10^9} = 10^{4.5} = 10^4 \\cdot \\sqrt{10} \\approx 10000 \\cdot 3.16227766 = 31622.7766$, yes.\n\n$31622.7766 / 7 = 4517.5395...$, floor = 4517 ✅\n\nNow check edge cases:\n\n- For $m = 4517$: $n = 49 \\times 4517^2$. Is this ≤ $10^9$?\n\nCompute $4517^2$: approximate: $4500^2 = 20{,}250{,}000$, $4517 = 4500 + 17$, so $(4500 + 17)^2 = 4500^2 + 2\\cdot4500\\cdot17 + 17^2 = 20{,}250{,}000 + 153{,}000 + 289 = 20{,}403{,}289$\n\nThen $49 \\times 20{,}403{,}289 = ?$\n\nBut $10^9 / 49 \\approx 20{,}408{,}163.265$, and $4517^2 = 20{,}403{,}289 < 20{,}408{,}163$, so yes, okay.\n\nWhat about $m = 4518$: $4518^2 = (4517 + 1)^2 = 4517^2 + 2\\cdot4517 + 1 = 20{,}403{,}289 + 9034 + 1 = 20{,}412{,}324$, which exceeds $10^9 / 49 \\approx 20{,}408{,}163$, so indeed 4517 is max.\n\nSimilarly, $m = 143$: $143^2 = 20449$, $49 \\times 20449 = 1{,}002{,}001$, which is > $10^6 = 1{,}000{,}000$, okay.\n\n$m = 142$: $142^2 = 20164$, $49 \\times 20164 = ?$ $20000 \\times 49 = 980{,}000$, $164 \\times 49 = (160+4)\\times49 = 7840 + 196 = 8036$, total $988{,}036 < 10^6$, so indeed 142 is too small.\n\nSo $m = 143$ to $4517$: count = $4517 - 143 + 1 = 4375$\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 2 is **4375**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The number of paths from (0,-2) to (8,0) using steps (+1,+1) and (+1,-1) requires 8 steps, with net y-change of +2, so 5 up and 3 down steps, giving C(8,5) = 56.
