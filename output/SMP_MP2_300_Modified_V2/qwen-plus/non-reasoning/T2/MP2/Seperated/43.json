  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**:  \nWe are told that $ a $ and $ b $ are integers such that  \n$$\na + \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{216}}.\n$$  \nWe are to compute $ k = a + 3 $, where $ a $ is the integer coefficient in the denested form $ a + \\sqrt{b} $.\n\nSo first, simplify the nested radical:  \n$$\n\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{216}}.\n$$\n\nNote: $ \\sqrt{216} = \\sqrt{36 \\cdot 6} = 6\\sqrt{6} $. So the expression becomes:\n$$\n\\sqrt{15 + 6\\sqrt{6}}.\n$$\n\nWe suspect this can be written as $ \\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y} $, or more likely $ a + \\sqrt{b} $, with $ a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} $. Since the outer square root is of a sum involving a square root, try assuming:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{15 + 6\\sqrt{6}} = \\sqrt{m} + \\sqrt{n},\n$$\nwith $ m, n $ rational (maybe integers). Then squaring both sides:\n\n$$\n(\\sqrt{m} + \\sqrt{n})^2 = m + n + 2\\sqrt{mn} = 15 + 6\\sqrt{6}.\n$$\n\nSo match rational and irrational parts:\n\n- $ m + n = 15 $\n- $ 2\\sqrt{mn} = 6\\sqrt{6} \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{mn} = 3\\sqrt{6} \\Rightarrow mn = 9 \\cdot 6 = 54 $.\n\nSo we need two numbers $ m, n $ such that:\n\n- $ m + n = 15 $\n- $ mn = 54 $\n\nSolve quadratic: $ t^2 - 15t + 54 = 0 $. Discriminant: $ 225 - 216 = 9 $, so roots:\n\n$$\nt = \\frac{15 \\pm 3}{2} = 9, 6.\n$$\n\nSo $ m = 9, n = 6 $ (or vice versa). Then:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{15 + 6\\sqrt{6}} = \\sqrt{9} + \\sqrt{6} = 3 + \\sqrt{6}.\n$$\n\nCheck: $ (3 + \\sqrt{6})^2 = 9 + 6 + 6\\sqrt{6} = 15 + 6\\sqrt{6} $. Yes! Correct.\n\nSo $ a = 3 $, $ b = 6 $. Then $ k = a + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 $.\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **6**.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**:  \nMark has a cursed six-sided die that **never rolls the same number twice in a row**, and all other outcomes are equally likely.\n\nWe are to compute the **expected number of rolls** it takes for Mark to roll **every number at least once** (i.e., expected time to see all 6 faces — a variant of the coupon collector problem with memory constraint).\n\nStandard coupon collector (i.i.d. uniform over 6) has expectation $ 6 H_6 = 6(1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{6}) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{49}{20} = \\frac{294}{20} = 14.7 $, but here transitions are not i.i.d.: after rolling a number, the next roll cannot be the same, and among the remaining 5 numbers, each is equally likely → probability $ \\frac{1}{5} $ each.\n\nSo this is a **Markov chain** problem: states are subsets of {1,…,6} seen so far, plus memory of last rolled number (since transition probabilities depend on previous roll). So state space is large: for each subset $ S \\subseteq [6] $, and each $ i \\in S $ (last seen element), we have state $ (S, i) $. But due to symmetry, we can reduce: only need size of $ S $, say $ k $ elements seen, and whether the last roll was one of them — but since last roll must be in $ S $, and all elements in $ S $ are symmetric, we can define state by $ k $ (number of distinct values seen) and possibly “type” — but actually, because the constraint is only “cannot repeat last value”, and all unseen values are equally likely, perhaps we can define state by $ k $ and the fact that last roll is some specific value (but due to symmetry, just $ k $ suffices? Not quite — because from state with $ k $ seen, if last roll was in the seen set, then next roll can be any of the other $ k-1 $ seen values or any of the $ 6-k $ unseen ones — total $ 5 $ options, each equally likely.\n\nYes! That’s key.\n\nLet’s formalize:\n\nLet $ E_k $ = expected additional rolls needed to collect all 6 numbers, given that currently $ k $ distinct numbers have been seen, and the **last roll was one of those $ k $** (which it always is, since you just rolled something). Since the die cannot repeat the last number, the next roll must be one of the other 5 numbers, uniformly at random.\n\nSo from state $ k $, after one roll:\n\n- With probability $ \\frac{6 - k}{5} $, we roll a *new* number → go to state $ k+1 $.\n- With probability $ \\frac{k - 1}{5} $, we roll a *previously seen* number (but not the last one) → stay in state $ k $.\n\nNote: Why $ k - 1 $? Because among the 5 allowed numbers (all except last), there are $ k $ total seen numbers, one of which is the forbidden last one, so $ k - 1 $ seen-but-not-last numbers remain; and $ 6 - k $ unseen numbers.\n\nSo recurrence:\n\n$$\nE_k = 1 + \\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1} + \\frac{k - 1}{5} E_k, \\quad \\text{for } k = 1,2,\\dots,5.\n$$\n\nBecause we spend 1 roll, then with prob $ \\frac{6-k}{5} $ go to $ k+1 $, else with prob $ \\frac{k-1}{5} $ stay at $ k $.\n\nWe also have $ E_6 = 0 $ (already collected all).\n\nWe need $ E_1 $, but wait — what is the initial state?\n\nAt the very first roll, there is no “previous roll”, so the constraint doesn’t apply yet. So first roll is uniform over 1–6, and after that, we have seen 1 number, and last roll is that number. So effectively, after roll 1, we are in state $ k = 1 $.\n\nSo total expected rolls = $ 1 + E_1 $.\n\nLet’s confirm: We must count the first roll, then expect $ E_1 $ more.\n\nSo define $ E_k $ = expected *additional* rolls starting from having seen $ k $ distinct numbers and just having rolled one of them.\n\nThen:\n\n- $ E_6 = 0 $\n- For $ k = 1 $ to $ 5 $:\n\n$$\nE_k = 1 + \\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1} + \\frac{k - 1}{5} E_k\n$$\n\nSolve for $ E_k $:\n\nBring $ \\frac{k - 1}{5} E_k $ to left:\n\n$$\nE_k - \\frac{k - 1}{5} E_k = 1 + \\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{5 - (k - 1)}{5} \\right) E_k = 1 + \\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{6 - k}{5} E_k = 1 + \\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1}\n$$\n\nAssuming $ k \\ne 6 $, so $ 6 - k \\ne 0 $, divide both sides by $ 6 - k $:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{5} E_k = \\frac{1}{6 - k} + \\frac{1}{5} E_{k+1}\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n$$\nE_k = \\frac{5}{6 - k} + E_{k+1}\n$$\n\nNice! So:\n\n$$\nE_k = E_{k+1} + \\frac{5}{6 - k}\n$$\n\nThat’s a simple backward recurrence.\n\nSo:\n\n- $ E_6 = 0 $\n- $ E_5 = E_6 + \\frac{5}{6 - 5} = 0 + 5 = 5 $\n- $ E_4 = E_5 + \\frac{5}{6 - 4} = 5 + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5 $\n- $ E_3 = E_4 + \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{15}{2} + \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{45 + 10}{6} = \\frac{55}{6} \\approx 9.1667 $\n- $ E_2 = E_3 + \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{55}{6} + \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{110 + 15}{12} = \\frac{125}{12} \\approx 10.4167 $\n- $ E_1 = E_2 + \\frac{5}{5} = \\frac{125}{12} + 1 = \\frac{137}{12} \\approx 11.4167 $\n\nThen total expected number of rolls = $ 1 + E_1 = 1 + \\frac{137}{12} = \\frac{149}{12} $.\n\nWait — hold on! Let's double-check indexing.\n\nWe said: After first roll, we are in state $ k = 1 $, and $ E_1 $ is expected *additional* rolls from there. So total = 1 (first roll) + $ E_1 $. Yes.\n\nBut let's verify recurrence derivation again, carefully.\n\nFrom state $ k $, one roll is made (cost 1). Then:\n\n- With prob $ \\frac{6 - k}{5} $, go to $ k+1 $\n- With prob $ \\frac{k - 1}{5} $, stay at $ k $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nE_k = 1 + \\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1} + \\frac{k - 1}{5} E_k\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nE_k \\left(1 - \\frac{k - 1}{5}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1}\n$$\n\n$$\nE_k \\cdot \\frac{6 - k}{5} = 1 + \\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1}\n$$\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nThen dividing both sides by $ \\frac{6 - k}{5} $ (nonzero for $ k < 6 $):\n\n$$\nE_k = \\frac{5}{6 - k} + E_{k+1}\n$$\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo:\n\n- $ E_5 = \\frac{5}{1} + E_6 = 5 $\n- $ E_4 = \\frac{5}{2} + E_5 = 2.5 + 5 = 7.5 $\n- $ E_3 = \\frac{5}{3} + 7.5 = \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{15}{2} = \\frac{10 + 45}{6} = \\frac{55}{6} $\n- $ E_2 = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{55}{6} = \\frac{15}{12} + \\frac{110}{12} = \\frac{125}{12} $\n- $ E_1 = \\frac{5}{5} + \\frac{125}{12} = 1 + \\frac{125}{12} = \\frac{137}{12} $\n\nThen total expected rolls = $ 1 + E_1 = 1 + \\frac{137}{12} = \\frac{149}{12} $.\n\nBut wait — is the first roll really \"free\" of constraints? Yes: the curse says \"never rolls the same number twice in a row\", so before any roll, there's no prior, so first roll is uniform over 6. So yes, we roll once, land on some number (now $ k = 1 $), and then proceed under the constraint.\n\nSo total expectation = $ 1 + E_1 = \\frac{149}{12} $.\n\nBut let's sanity check with small case.\n\nSuppose 2-sided die (faces A,B), cursed: no repeats. What’s expected time to see both?\n\n- Roll 1: get A or B → k=1.\n- From k=1: last was say A; next roll must be B (only other option), so guaranteed to get new on roll 2. So total rolls = 2 always ⇒ expectation = 2.\n\nUsing formula: For n=2,\n\n$ E_1 = \\frac{5}{2-1}? $ No — our derivation was for n=6. Generalizing: for n-face die, from state k, forbidden is last, so  n−1 options, of which $ n−k $ are new.\n\nSo general recurrence would be:\n\nFrom k, next roll has $ n−1 $ equally likely options:\n\n- $ n−k $ new → go to k+1\n- $ k−1 $ old (excluding last) → stay at k\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nE_k = 1 + \\frac{n - k}{n - 1} E_{k+1} + \\frac{k - 1}{n - 1} E_k\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nE_k \\left(1 - \\frac{k - 1}{n - 1}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{n - k}{n - 1} E_{k+1}\n$$\n\n$$\nE_k \\cdot \\frac{n - k}{n - 1} = 1 + \\frac{n - k}{n - 1} E_{k+1}\n$$\n\nSo again:\n\n$$\nE_k = \\frac{n - 1}{n - k} + E_{k+1}\n$$\n\nFor n=2:\n\n- $ E_1 = \\frac{2 - 1}{2 - 1} + E_2 = 1 + 0 = 1 $\n- Total = 1 (first roll) + $ E_1 = 2 $. Correct.\n\nSo formula holds.\n\nThus for n=6:\n\n$$\nE_k = E_{k+1} + \\frac{5}{6 - k}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n- $ E_5 = \\frac{5}{1} = 5 $\n- $ E_4 = \\frac{5}{2} + 5 = \\frac{15}{2} $\n- $ E_3 = \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{15}{2} = \\frac{10 + 45}{6} = \\frac{55}{6} $\n- $ E_2 = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{55}{6} = \\frac{15 + 110}{12} = \\frac{125}{12} $\n- $ E_1 = \\frac{5}{5} + \\frac{125}{12} = \\frac{137}{12} $\n- Total = $ 1 + \\frac{137}{12} = \\frac{149}{12} $\n\n$ \\frac{149}{12} = 12.416\\overline{6} $. Does that make sense? Less than standard coupon collector’s 14.7, which makes sense because the constraint *helps* avoid wasteful repeats — though not too much, since you still might roll an already-seen number (just not the immediate last). So yes, ~12.4 seems plausible.\n\nThus answer to Problem 2 is $ \\frac{149}{12} $.\n\nBut let's write as reduced fraction: 149 is prime? 149 not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11 → yes, prime. 12 shares no factor → $ \\frac{149}{12} $ is reduced.\n\nSo final answers:\n\n- Problem 1: 6  \n- Problem 2: $ \\frac{149}{12} $\n\nNow format JSON.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We simplify √(15 + √216). Since √216 = 6√6, the expression becomes √(15 + 6√6). Assuming it equals √m + √n, squaring gives m + n = 15 and 2√(mn) = 6√6 → mn = 54. Solving t² − 15t + 54 = 0 yields t = 6, 9, so √(15 + 6√6) = √9 + √6 = 3 + √6. Thus a = 3, and k = a + 3 = 6. Problem 2: This is a constrained coupon collector problem where after each roll, the next roll cannot be the same as the previous, and all other 5 outcomes are equally likely. Define E_k as expected additional rolls needed when k distinct numbers have been seen and the last roll was one of them. The recurrence derived is E_k = E_{k+1} + 5/(6 − k) for k = 1 to 5, with E_6 = 0. Solving backward: E_5 = 5, E_4 = 15/2, E_3 = 55/6, E_2 = 125/12, E_1 = 137/12. Since the first roll is unconstrained and brings us to k = 1, total expectation is 1 + E_1 = 149/12.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"149/12\"\n}",
