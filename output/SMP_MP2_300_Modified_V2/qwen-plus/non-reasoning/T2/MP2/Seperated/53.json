  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> Two diameters and one radius are drawn in a circle of radius 1, dividing the circle into 5 sectors. The largest possible area of the smallest sector can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b} \\pi$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100a+b$. Instead of computing the numerical identifier formed by the numerator and denominator of the reduced fractional coefficient of $\\pi$ expressing the largest possible area of the smallest sector, simply find $k$, where $k$ is four greater than the denominator of that fraction.\n\nWait — the problem says:  \n- \"The largest possible area of the smallest sector can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}\\pi$\"  \n- Then it says: *\"Instead of computing $100a + b$, simply find $k$, where $k$ is four greater than the denominator of that fraction.\"*  \nSo we need to find $b$, then compute $k = b + 4$.\n\nSo our goal is to find the **maximum possible value of the minimum sector area**, under the constraint that the circle (radius 1) is divided into **5 sectors** by **two diameters and one radius**.\n\nLet’s understand the geometry.\n\n- A **diameter** is a line segment through the center, endpoints on the circle. Drawing a diameter corresponds to drawing a straight line through the center — i.e., defining two opposite points on the circle, or equivalently, defining an angle of $\\pi$ radians (180°) — but more importantly, a diameter defines *two radial lines*: from center to each endpoint — i.e., two radii in opposite directions.\n\nBut wait: the problem says “two diameters and one radius” are drawn.\n\nEach **diameter** consists of **two opposite radii**, so drawing a diameter adds **two radial lines** (at angles $\\theta$ and $\\theta + \\pi$). So two diameters give **four radial lines**, unless they coincide or overlap.\n\nBut if two diameters are drawn, they intersect at the center, and unless they’re the same line (i.e., same diameter), they form an angle between them — say angle $\\alpha$ between the two diameters. Each diameter contributes two opposite rays, so total distinct rays depend on whether diameters are distinct.\n\nLet’s count how many **distinct radial lines (rays from center)** are drawn:\n\n- One diameter → 2 opposite rays.\n- Second diameter → another pair of opposite rays. If it's not the same as the first, and not perpendicular necessarily, then generally gives 2 more rays — unless it coincides with the first (then no new rays), or shares a ray? But a diameter is defined by its direction; two distinct diameters intersect at center and have two distinct directions (angles), say $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$, with $0 < |\\theta_1 - \\theta_2| < \\pi$. Then their four endpoints are at angles $\\theta_1$, $\\theta_1 + \\pi$, $\\theta_2$, $\\theta_2 + \\pi$. These are 4 distinct angles modulo $2\\pi$, unless $\\theta_2 = \\theta_1 + \\pi$, which would make them the same diameter.\n\nSo two distinct diameters give **4 distinct radial lines**, i.e., 4 rays from center.\n\nThen adding **one more radius**, i.e., one more ray — unless it coincides with one of the existing 4, it adds a 5th ray.\n\nSo total number of rays from center = 5 ⇒ divides circle into **5 sectors**, as stated.\n\nSo configuration: 5 rays from center → 5 central angles summing to $2\\pi$. Sector areas are proportional to central angles (since radius = 1, area = $\\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\theta$), so area of sector with angle $\\theta$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\theta$. So maximizing the minimal sector area is equivalent to maximizing the minimal central angle.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to:\n\n> Choose 5 rays (directions) in the circle, constrained such that among them, **two pairs are antipodal** (i.e., differ by $\\pi$) — because they come from two diameters — and the fifth ray is arbitrary (a single radius). So the set of 5 angles modulo $2\\pi$ must contain two disjoint antipodal pairs, and one extra angle.\n\nLet’s formalize.\n\nLet the angles (measured from some fixed axis) be:\n\n- From diameter 1: $\\alpha$, $\\alpha + \\pi$  \n- From diameter 2: $\\beta$, $\\beta + \\pi$  \n- From radius: $\\gamma$\n\nAll angles modulo $2\\pi$. To get exactly 5 distinct rays, we require all five angles distinct mod $2\\pi$. So $\\gamma$ must not equal any of $\\alpha, \\alpha+\\pi, \\beta, \\beta+\\pi$, and also $\\alpha \\not\\equiv \\beta \\pmod{\\pi}$ (otherwise diameters coincide).\n\nSo wlog, assume $0 \\le \\alpha < \\beta < \\pi$, since angles are modulo $2\\pi$, and antipodal symmetry lets us fix one diameter along x-axis: let $\\alpha = 0$, so diameter 1 gives rays at $0$ and $\\pi$.\n\nLet diameter 2 be at angle $\\theta$, where $0 < \\theta < \\pi$, $\\theta \\ne 0$, so rays at $\\theta$ and $\\theta + \\pi$.\n\nThen the five rays are at angles:\n\n- $0$\n- $\\pi$\n- $\\theta$\n- $\\theta + \\pi$\n- $\\gamma$\n\nAll modulo $2\\pi$, and all distinct.\n\nWe can assume $0 < \\theta < \\pi$, and choose $\\gamma$ in $(0, 2\\pi)$, avoiding those four values.\n\nNow, to get sector angles, we sort the 5 angles around the circle, take differences (with wrap-around), and get 5 positive angles summing to $2\\pi$. We want to **maximize the minimum** of those 5 angles.\n\nThis is a classic “maximin” spacing problem with constraints.\n\nBecause of symmetry, likely optimal configuration is when the 5 angles are as evenly spaced as possible — but subject to constraint that among them, two pairs are antipodal.\n\nSo we have two antipodal pairs: $(0,\\pi)$ and $(\\theta, \\theta+\\pi)$. So the set is symmetric under rotation by $\\pi$ only if $\\theta = \\pi/2$, i.e., diameters are perpendicular — then rays are at $0, \\pi/2, \\pi, 3\\pi/2$, i.e., the four cardinal directions — that's 4 rays. Then adding a fifth radius $\\gamma$ breaks symmetry.\n\nBut we need exactly 5 rays, so with two diameters (4 rays) + one radius = 5.\n\nSo base configuration: 4 rays at positions $0, \\theta, \\pi, \\theta+\\pi$, with $0 < \\theta < \\pi$, and fifth ray at $\\gamma$.\n\nTo maximize minimal arc between consecutive rays (after sorting), we should place $\\gamma$ to “fill the largest gap” among the 4-ray configuration.\n\nFirst, consider the 4-ray case (two diameters): angles $0, \\theta, \\pi, \\theta+\\pi$. Sort them modulo $2\\pi$.\n\nAssume $0 < \\theta < \\pi$. Then ordering is:\n\n- $0$\n- $\\theta$\n- $\\pi$\n- $\\theta + \\pi$ (since $\\theta < \\pi \\implies \\theta + \\pi < 2\\pi$)\n\nSo sorted: $0,\\ \\theta,\\ \\pi,\\ \\theta+\\pi$\n\nDifferences (arcs):\n\n- $\\theta - 0 = \\theta$\n- $\\pi - \\theta$\n- $(\\theta + \\pi) - \\pi = \\theta$\n- $2\\pi - (\\theta + \\pi) = \\pi - \\theta$\n\nSo the four arcs are: $\\theta,\\ \\pi - \\theta,\\ \\theta,\\ \\pi - \\theta$\n\nSo gaps alternate: two of size $\\theta$, two of size $\\pi - \\theta$. So the largest gap is $\\max(\\theta, \\pi - \\theta)$, minimized when $\\theta = \\pi/2$, giving all gaps $\\pi/2$. So with perpendicular diameters, the 4 rays divide circle into 4 equal quadrants of $\\pi/2$ each.\n\nNow add a fifth ray $\\gamma$. To maximize the minimal sector, we should place $\\gamma$ in the middle of the largest gap. But if all gaps are equal ($\\pi/2$), then inserting $\\gamma$ in the middle of any gap splits it into two gaps of $\\pi/4$ each. Then the gaps become: $\\pi/4,\\ \\pi/4,\\ \\pi/2,\\ \\pi/2,\\ \\pi/2$? Wait no — inserting one point in a circle with 4 points creates 5 arcs. Original 4 arcs sum to $2\\pi$. Inserting a point in one arc of size $L$ replaces it with two arcs summing to $L$. So if all original arcs are $\\pi/2$, and we split one into $x$ and $L - x$, then the five arc lengths are: $x,\\ L-x,\\ \\pi/2,\\ \\pi/2,\\ \\pi/2$, i.e., three $\\pi/2$'s and two that sum to $\\pi/2$. To maximize the minimum, set $x = L - x = \\pi/4$. Then arcs are: $\\pi/4,\\ \\pi/4,\\ \\pi/2,\\ \\pi/2,\\ \\pi/2$. Minimum is $\\pi/4$.\n\nBut maybe we can do better by choosing $\\theta \\ne \\pi/2$, so that gaps are unequal, and we can place $\\gamma$ to balance them.\n\nSuppose $\\theta < \\pi/2$. Then gaps are: $\\theta,\\ \\pi - \\theta,\\ \\theta,\\ \\pi - \\theta$, with $\\theta < \\pi - \\theta$. So two small gaps of size $\\theta$, two large of size $\\pi - \\theta$. The largest gap is $\\pi - \\theta > \\pi/2$.\n\nIf we place $\\gamma$ in the middle of a large gap, splitting it into two of size $(\\pi - \\theta)/2$, then the multiset of gaps becomes:\n\n- $\\theta$ (twice)\n- $(\\pi - \\theta)/2$ (twice, since two large gaps, but we only add one point, so only one large gap is split)\nWait no — there are two large gaps (both size $\\pi - \\theta$), but we only add one ray, so we can only split one of them.\n\nSo after adding $\\gamma$ in one large gap, arcs are:\n\n- $\\theta$\n- $\\theta$\n- $(\\pi - \\theta)/2$\n- $(\\pi - \\theta)/2$\n- remaining large gap: $\\pi - \\theta$\n\nSo arcs: $\\theta,\\ \\theta,\\ \\pi - \\theta,\\ \\frac{\\pi - \\theta}{2},\\ \\frac{\\pi - \\theta}{2}$\n\nSum check: $2\\theta + (\\pi - \\theta) + 2\\cdot\\frac{\\pi - \\theta}{2} = 2\\theta + \\pi - \\theta + \\pi - \\theta = 2\\pi$. Good.\n\nSo the five arc lengths: $\\theta,\\ \\theta,\\ \\pi - \\theta,\\ \\frac{\\pi - \\theta}{2},\\ \\frac{\\pi - \\theta}{2}$\n\nThe minimum among these is $\\min\\left( \\theta,\\ \\frac{\\pi - \\theta}{2} \\right)$, since $\\pi - \\theta > \\frac{\\pi - \\theta}{2}$, and $\\theta < \\pi - \\theta$ by assumption.\n\nSo min = $\\min\\left( \\theta,\\ \\frac{\\pi - \\theta}{2} \\right)$\n\nWe want to maximize this minimum over $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi/2)$.\n\nSet $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi - \\theta}{2}$ → solve:\n\n$2\\theta = \\pi - \\theta \\implies 3\\theta = \\pi \\implies \\theta = \\pi/3$\n\nCheck: $\\pi/3 \\approx 1.047$, $\\pi - \\pi/3 = 2\\pi/3 \\approx 2.094$, half is $\\pi/3$. So yes, equal.\n\nSo at $\\theta = \\pi/3$, min = $\\pi/3$\n\nThen arcs are:\n\n- $\\theta = \\pi/3$ (twice)\n- $\\pi - \\theta = 2\\pi/3$\n- $(\\pi - \\theta)/2 = \\pi/3$ (twice)\n\nSo arcs: $\\pi/3,\\ \\pi/3,\\ \\pi/3,\\ \\pi/3,\\ 2\\pi/3$? Wait no — earlier list was $\\theta,\\ \\theta,\\ \\pi - \\theta,\\ \\frac{\\pi - \\theta}{2},\\ \\frac{\\pi - \\theta}{2}$ → that's five: $\\pi/3,\\ \\pi/3,\\ 2\\pi/3,\\ \\pi/3,\\ \\pi/3$ → that's four $\\pi/3$ and one $2\\pi/3$? Sum: $4\\cdot\\pi/3 + 2\\pi/3 = 6\\pi/3 = 2\\pi$. Yes. So arcs: four of $\\pi/3$, one of $2\\pi/3$. So minimum is $\\pi/3$.\n\nIs this the best possible?\n\nWhat if we place $\\gamma$ not in a large gap, but in a small gap? Then we split a $\\theta$-gap into two pieces, say $x$ and $\\theta - x$, so arcs become: $x,\\ \\theta - x,\\ \\theta,\\ \\pi - \\theta,\\ \\pi - \\theta$. Min is $\\min(x, \\theta - x, \\theta, \\pi - \\theta)$. Max min occurs when $x = \\theta/2$, so min = $\\min(\\theta/2, \\theta, \\pi - \\theta) = \\theta/2$, which is less than $\\pi/3$ for $\\theta = \\pi/3$ gives $\\pi/6 < \\pi/3$, so worse.\n\nSo best is to split a large gap, and optimize $\\theta$ so that $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi - \\theta}{2} \\implies \\theta = \\pi/3$, giving min arc = $\\pi/3$.\n\nBut wait — is there a configuration where min arc > $\\pi/3$?\n\nSuppose we try to make all five arcs equal: $2\\pi/5 = 0.4\\pi \\approx 1.2566$, while $\\pi/3 \\approx 1.0472$, so $2\\pi/5 > \\pi/3$, so potentially better. But can we achieve equal spacing with the antipodal constraint?\n\nEqual spacing would mean angles at $0, 2\\pi/5, 4\\pi/5, 6\\pi/5, 8\\pi/5$. Check if among these, there are two antipodal pairs.\n\nAntipodal means difference $\\pi$. Check differences:\n\n- $0$ and $\\pi$: is $\\pi$ in set? $2\\pi/5 = 72^\\circ$, $4\\pi/5 = 144^\\circ$, $6\\pi/5 = 216^\\circ$, $8\\pi/5 = 288^\\circ$. $\\pi = 180^\\circ = 5\\pi/5$, not in set. So no diameter includes $\\pi$, so cannot have a diameter unless both $\\phi$ and $\\phi + \\pi$ are in set.\n\nSo for a set to contain a diameter, it must contain both $\\phi$ and $\\phi + \\pi$. In equally spaced 5 points, since 5 is odd, adding $\\pi$ to each angle maps the set to itself only if $\\pi$ is multiple of $2\\pi/5$, i.e., $k \\cdot 2\\pi/5 = \\pi \\implies k = 5/2$, not integer. So no, 5 equally spaced points cannot contain an antipodal pair. Thus equal spacing is impossible under constraints.\n\nSo maximum min arc is indeed $\\pi/3$, achieved when $\\theta = \\pi/3$, and $\\gamma$ placed to split a large gap.\n\nBut wait — we have two diameters: at $0$ and $\\pi$, and at $\\theta = \\pi/3$ and $\\theta + \\pi = 4\\pi/3$. So rays at: $0,\\ \\pi/3,\\ \\pi,\\ 4\\pi/3$. That's four. Now we need to add $\\gamma$. To split the large gap — where are the gaps?\n\nSorted angles: $0,\\ \\pi/3,\\ \\pi,\\ 4\\pi/3$\n\nDifferences:\n\n- $\\pi/3 - 0 = \\pi/3$\n- $\\pi - \\pi/3 = 2\\pi/3$\n- $4\\pi/3 - \\pi = \\pi/3$\n- $2\\pi - 4\\pi/3 = 2\\pi/3$\n\nSo gaps: $\\pi/3,\\ 2\\pi/3,\\ \\pi/3,\\ 2\\pi/3$\n\nSo two gaps of $2\\pi/3$. Place $\\gamma$ in the middle of one $2\\pi/3$ gap, say between $\\pi$ and $4\\pi/3$: midpoint is $\\pi + \\pi/3 = 4\\pi/3$? No: gap from $\\pi$ to $4\\pi/3$ is length $4\\pi/3 - \\pi = \\pi/3$, not $2\\pi/3$. Wait I think I messed up.\n\nAngles: $0,\\ \\pi/3,\\ \\pi,\\ 4\\pi/3$\n\nCompute differences in order:\n\n- $0$ to $\\pi/3$: $\\pi/3$\n- $\\pi/3$ to $\\pi$: $\\pi - \\pi/3 = 2\\pi/3$\n- $\\pi$ to $4\\pi/3$: $4\\pi/3 - \\pi = \\pi/3$\n- $4\\pi/3$ to $2\\pi$: $2\\pi - 4\\pi/3 = 2\\pi/3$\n\nYes, so gaps are $\\pi/3,\\ 2\\pi/3,\\ \\pi/3,\\ 2\\pi/3$\n\nSo the large gaps are from $\\pi/3$ to $\\pi$, and from $4\\pi/3$ to $2\\pi$.\n\nSo place $\\gamma$ at midpoint of first large gap: $\\pi/3 + \\pi/3 = 2\\pi/3$? Midpoint of interval $[\\pi/3, \\pi]$ is $(\\pi/3 + \\pi)/2 = (4\\pi/3)/2 = 2\\pi/3$\n\nSimilarly, midpoint of $[4\\pi/3, 2\\pi]$ is $(4\\pi/3 + 2\\pi)/2 = (10\\pi/3)/2 = 5\\pi/3$\n\nSo choose $\\gamma = 2\\pi/3$\n\nNow full set of angles: $0,\\ \\pi/3,\\ 2\\pi/3,\\ \\pi,\\ 4\\pi/3$\n\nSort them: $0,\\ \\pi/3,\\ 2\\pi/3,\\ \\pi,\\ 4\\pi/3$\n\nDifferences:\n\n- $\\pi/3 - 0 = \\pi/3$\n- $2\\pi/3 - \\pi/3 = \\pi/3$\n- $\\pi - 2\\pi/3 = \\pi/3$\n- $4\\pi/3 - \\pi = \\pi/3$\n- $2\\pi - 4\\pi/3 = 2\\pi/3$\n\nWait, that's only five angles, but differences should be five arcs. Sorted list has 5 angles, so 5 arcs: between consecutive, and last to first.\n\nList: $a_1=0,\\ a_2=\\pi/3,\\ a_3=2\\pi/3,\\ a_4=\\pi,\\ a_5=4\\pi/3$\n\nArcs:\n\n- $a_2 - a_1 = \\pi/3$\n- $a_3 - a_2 = \\pi/3$\n- $a_4 - a_3 = \\pi/3$\n- $a_5 - a_4 = \\pi/3$\n- $2\\pi - a_5 = 2\\pi - 4\\pi/3 = 2\\pi/3$\n\nSo arcs: four of $\\pi/3$, one of $2\\pi/3$. Min = $\\pi/3$\n\nBut is there a way to get min larger than $\\pi/3$?\n\nSuppose we choose $\\theta$ such that after adding $\\gamma$, we get three arcs of size $x$, two of size $y$, etc., and maximize min.\n\nAlternative approach: Since we must have two antipodal pairs, the configuration is determined by angles $0,\\ \\pi,\\ \\theta,\\ \\theta+\\pi,\\ \\gamma$\n\nThe five angles modulo $2\\pi$. To maximize minimal adjacent difference, best is to make as many arcs equal as possible.\n\nNote that the set must be invariant under the map $x \\mapsto x + \\pi$ applied to pairs, but not globally.\n\nAnother idea: Use symmetry. Suppose we set $\\gamma = \\pi/2$, and choose $\\theta$ optimally.\n\nBut perhaps $\\pi/3$ is indeed maximal.\n\nAssume min arc is $m$. Then sum of arcs is $2\\pi$, so $5m \\le 2\\pi \\implies m \\le 2\\pi/5 = 0.4\\pi \\approx 1.2566$, while $\\pi/3 \\approx 1.0472$, so room for improvement.\n\nCan we achieve $m = 2\\pi/5$? As argued, no, because of antipodal constraint.\n\nWhat is the theoretical maximum? Perhaps $\\pi/3$ is answer.\n\nConfirm with known sources or logic.\n\nI recall a similar problem: With two diameters (4 rays) and one extra radius, max min sector is $\\pi/3$.\n\nAssuming that, then minimal central angle is $\\pi/3$, so minimal sector area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{angle} \\times r^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\times 1^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$\n\nWait! Important: Area of sector with central angle $\\theta$ in circle radius $r$ is $\\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\theta$. Since $r = 1$, area = $\\frac{1}{2} \\theta$.\n\nSo if minimal central angle is $\\pi/3$, then minimal area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$\n\nSo $\\frac{a}{b}\\pi = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi$, so $a=1, b=6$\n\nThen $k = b + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10$\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIs minimal central angle $\\pi/3$, leading to area $\\pi/6$?\n\nIn our construction, yes: arcs include $\\pi/3$, so sector area $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$\n\nAnd we argued this is maximal possible min.\n\nThus $b = 6$, $k = 10$\n\nSo answer to Problem 1 is **10**\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> What is the smallest integer greater than 10 such that the sum of the digits in its base 17 representation is equal to the sum of the digits in its base 10 representation?\n\nWe need smallest integer $n > 10$ such that $s_{10}(n) = s_{17}(n)$, where $s_b(n)$ is sum of base-$b$ digits of $n$.\n\nWe can brute-force check small $n$.\n\nRecall base 17 digits are 0–9, then A=10, B=11, ..., G=16.\n\nBut for small $n$, base 17 representation is just $n$ itself if $n < 17$, since it's a single digit.\n\nSo for $11 \\le n \\le 16$:  \n- Base 10 digit sum = $n$ (since single digit)  \n- Base 17 digit sum = $n$ (same)  \nSo equality holds for all $n$ from 11 to 16.\n\nBut the problem asks for smallest integer **greater than 10**, so 11?\n\nCheck $n = 11$:  \n- Base 10: digit sum = 1 + 1 = 2  \nWait! I made a mistake.\n\n$n = 11$ in base 10 is \"11\", digits 1 and 1, sum = 2  \nIn base 17, since $11 < 17$, it's single digit \"B\" or just 11, digit sum = 11\n\nSo $s_{10}(11) = 2$, $s_{17}(11) = 11$, not equal.\n\nSimilarly, $n = 12$: s10 = 1+2 = 3, s17 = 12  \nNot equal.\n\nSo for $n < 17$, s17(n) = n, s10(n) = digit sum of decimal representation, which for $n < 10$ is $n$, but $n > 10$, so for $n = 11$ to $16$: s10 = 1 + d where d = 1 to 6, so s10 = 2 to 7, while s17 = n = 11 to 16, so never equal.\n\nSo start checking from $n = 17$ upward.\n\nLet’s make a table.\n\nWe need efficient way.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- For $n$, write in base 10: digits $d_k...d_0$, sum $S_{10} = \\sum d_i$\n\n- In base 17: $n = a_m 17^m + ... + a_0$, digits $a_i \\in [0,16]$, sum $S_{17} = \\sum a_i$\n\nWe want $S_{10} = S_{17}$\n\nStart checking $n = 17$:\n\n- Base 10: \"17\", sum = 1 + 7 = 8  \n- Base 17: $17 = 1 \\times 17^1 + 0 \\times 17^0$, so digits \"10\", sum = 1 + 0 = 1 ≠ 8\n\nn = 18:  \n- s10 = 1 + 8 = 9  \n- 18 in base 17 = 1×17 + 1 = \"11\", sum = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nn = 19: s10 = 10, base 17 = \"12\", sum = 3\n\n...\n\nn = 25: s10 = 2 + 5 = 7, base 17 = 1×17 + 8 = \"18\", sum = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nn = 26: s10 = 8, base 17 = \"19\", sum = 1 + 9 = 10\n\nn = 27: s10 = 9, \"1A\" = 1 + 10 = 11\n\nn = 28: s10 = 10, \"1B\" = 1 + 11 = 12\n\n...\n\nWhen does s17 catch up? s17 for two-digit base 17 numbers (i.e., $17 \\le n \\le 17^2 - 1 = 288$) is $a + b$ where $n = 17a + b$, $a \\ge 1$, $0 \\le b \\le 16$, so $s_{17} = a + b$\n\nWhile $s_{10}$ is sum of decimal digits.\n\nSo for $n = 17a + b$, we need $s_{10}(17a + b) = a + b$\n\nSince $a \\ge 1$, $b \\ge 0$, and $n > 10$\n\nTry small $a$:\n\na = 1: n = 17 + b, b = 0 to 16, so n = 17 to 33\n\ns17 = 1 + b\n\ns10(n): compute for each\n\nn=17: s10=8, s17=1+0=1  \nn=18:9 vs 2  \nn=19:10 vs 3  \nn=20:2 vs 4? 20: digits 2,0 sum=2, s17=1+3=4?

Adding a fifth radius γ creates five sectors. To maximize the minimal sector area, we maximize the minimal central angle. With θ = π/3 and γ placed to split a large gap, the minimal central angle is π/3, giving sector area (1/2)(π/3) = π/6. Thus a=1, b=6, and k = b + 4 = 10. Problem 2: We search for the smallest n > 10 where digit sum in base 10 equals digit sum in base 17. Checking multiples of 17, n = 17k, we need s10(17k) = k. For k = 9, n = 153, s10 = 1+5+3 = 9, and in base 17, 153 = 9×17 + 0, so digits '90', sum = 9 + 0 = 9.
