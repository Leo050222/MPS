  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve each step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> Ava and Tiffany participate in a knockout tournament consisting of a total of 32 players. In each of 5 rounds, the remaining players are paired uniformly at random. In each pair, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is knocked out of the tournament. The probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other during the tournament is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of evaluating the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator representing the probability that the two designated players meet during the tournament, simply find $e = b - 16$, where $b$ is the denominator of that probability when expressed as a reduced fraction.\n\nSo we need to compute the probability that Ava and Tiffany meet *at some point* in a random knockout tournament with 32 players, where pairings are random each round (among survivors), and winners are decided fairly.\n\nThis is a classic problem.\n\n#### Key idea:\n\nIn any single-elimination tournament with $2^n$ players, where match pairings are random each round among remaining players (and outcomes are fair), the probability that two specific players meet is $\\frac{2}{2^n} = \\frac{2}{N}$, where $N = 32$.\n\nWait — is that true?\n\nLet’s verify with small cases.\n\n- With $N = 2$: only one match. Ava and Tiffany must play → probability = 1 = $2/2$ → yes.\n\n- With $N = 4$: players A, B, C, D. What’s P(A and B meet)?\n\nTotal possible tournament structures? But since pairings are random each round, and winners random, it's symmetric.\n\nAlternative known result: In a random knockout tournament with $n$ players (power of 2), the probability that two specific players meet is $\\frac{2}{n}$.\n\nWhy? Because each match eliminates exactly one player. To eliminate all but one winner, exactly $n-1$ matches are played. Each match involves 2 players, so total number of *player-pair appearances* across all matches is $2(n-1)$. There are $\\binom{n}{2}$ possible unordered pairs. If all pairings were equally likely over all possible tournaments (uniform over all possible match histories), then expected number of times a given pair meets is $\\frac{2(n-1)}{\\binom{n}{2}} = \\frac{2(n-1)}{n(n-1)/2} = \\frac{4}{n}$. But that’s expectation — not probability.\n\nBut actually, there's a cleaner argument:\n\n**Key insight**: For two players to meet, they must be in the same half of the bracket *at the right time*, but here bracket is not fixed — pairings are random each round.\n\nBetter approach: Think recursively.\n\nLet $P(n)$ be the probability that two specific players meet in a tournament of $n = 2^k$ players.\n\nAt round 1, all $n$ players are randomly paired into $n/2$ matches.\n\n- Probability Ava and Tiffany are paired in round 1: $\\frac{1}{n-1}$. (Because Ava can be paired with any of the other $n-1$ players equally.)\n\nIf they meet in round 1, done.\n\nIf not, both must win their respective matches to survive to round 2. Since each has 1/2 chance to win, and independent, probability both win = $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\n\nThen, conditional on both surviving round 1 *and not playing each other*, they are now among $n/2$ players, and the situation restarts — i.e., probability they meet later is $P(n/2)$.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nP(n) = \\frac{1}{n-1} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n-1}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot P\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nLet’s test for $n = 2$: $P(2) = 1$, correct.\n\nFor $n = 4$:  \n$P(4) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot P(2) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nIs that correct? Let's enumerate.\n\nWith 4 players: A, T, X, Y.\n\nRound 1 pairings: 3 possibilities (since pairings of 4 labeled items: number of perfect matchings = 3):\n\n1. (A,T), (X,Y) → they meet ⇒ prob 1/3.\n\n2. (A,X), (T,Y) → A and T both must win to meet in final. Each wins w.p. 1/2 ⇒ both win w.p. 1/4 ⇒ then they meet in round 2 (final). So contributes $(1/3)(1/4) = 1/12$.\n\n3. (A,Y), (T,X) → same: 1/12.\n\nTotal = $1/3 + 1/12 + 1/12 = 4/12 + 1/12 + 1/12 = 6/12 = 1/2$. Yes.\n\nSo $P(4) = 1/2 = 2/4$.\n\nSimilarly, $P(2) = 1 = 2/2$.\n\nTry $n = 8$ using formula:\n\n$$\nP(8) = \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot P(4) = \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{6}{56} = \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{3}{28} = \\frac{4}{28} + \\frac{3}{28} = \\frac{7}{28} = \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{8}.\n$$\n\nYes! So pattern holds: $P(n) = \\frac{2}{n}$ for $n = 2^k$.\n\nThus for $n = 32$, $P = \\frac{2}{32} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nSo reduced fraction is $\\frac{1}{16}$, so $a = 1$, $b = 16$.\n\nThen $e = b - 16 = 16 - 16 = 0$.\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> Let $p$ be a real number and $c \\neq 0$ an integer such that  \n> $$\nc - 0.1 < x^{p}\\left(\\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}}\\right) < c + 0.1\n$$  \n> for all (positive) real numbers $x$ with $0 < x < 10^{-100}$. Find the ordered pair $(p, c)$.\n\nWe are to find $p$ and integer $c \\ne 0$ such that the expression is within $0.1$ of $c$ for all tiny positive $x$.\n\nThat suggests the expression tends to $c$ as $x \\to 0^+$, and the convergence is fast enough that even for $x < 10^{-100}$, it's within $0.1$.\n\nSo essentially, find the limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} x^p \\cdot \\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{1 + (1+x)^{10}}\n$$\nand choose $p$ so that this limit exists and is a nonzero finite integer $c$, and the error is less than $0.1$ near zero.\n\nSo first expand $(1+x)^{10}$ for small $x$:\n\n$$\n(1+x)^{10} = 1 + 10x + \\binom{10}{2}x^2 + \\cdots = 1 + 10x + 45x^2 + O(x^3)\n$$\n\nThen numerator:\n\n$$\n1 - (1+x)^{10} = -10x - 45x^2 + O(x^3)\n$$\n\nDenominator:\n\n$$\n1 + (1+x)^{10} = 2 + 10x + 45x^2 + O(x^3)\n$$\n\nSo the fraction:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{1 + (1+x)^{10}} = \\frac{-10x - 45x^2 + O(x^3)}{2 + 10x + 45x^2 + O(x^3)}\n$$\n\nAs $x \\to 0$, denominator → 2, so leading behavior is:\n\n$$\n\\approx \\frac{-10x}{2} = -5x\n$$\n\nMore precisely, do series expansion:\n\nLet’s write:\n\n$$\n\\frac{-10x - 45x^2 + O(x^3)}{2(1 + 5x + \\frac{45}{2}x^2 + O(x^3))} = \\frac{-10x - 45x^2 + O(x^3)}{2} \\cdot \\left(1 - 5x + O(x^2)\\right)\n$$\n\nBecause $1/(1+\\varepsilon) = 1 - \\varepsilon + \\varepsilon^2 - \\dots$\n\nSo:\n\nFirst factor: $\\frac{-10x - 45x^2}{2} = -5x - \\frac{45}{2}x^2$\n\nMultiply by $(1 - 5x)$:\n\n$$\n(-5x - \\tfrac{45}{2}x^2)(1 - 5x) = -5x + 25x^2 - \\tfrac{45}{2}x^2 + O(x^3) = -5x + \\left(25 - \\tfrac{45}{2}\\right)x^2 + O(x^3)\n$$\n\n$25 = 50/2$, so $50/2 - 45/2 = 5/2$, so:\n\n$$\n= -5x + \\tfrac{5}{2}x^2 + O(x^3)\n$$\n\nSo overall:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{1 + (1+x)^{10}} = -5x + \\frac{5}{2}x^2 + O(x^3)\n$$\n\nTherefore, the whole expression is:\n\n$$\nx^p \\cdot \\left(-5x + \\frac{5}{2}x^2 + O(x^3)\\right) = -5 x^{p+1} + \\frac{5}{2} x^{p+2} + O(x^{p+3})\n$$\n\nWe want this to approach a nonzero *integer* $c$ as $x \\to 0^+$. For a limit to exist and be nonzero finite, the exponent of the leading term must be 0, i.e., $p+1 = 0 \\implies p = -1$.\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nx^{-1} \\cdot \\left(-5x + \\frac{5}{2}x^2 + O(x^3)\\right) = -5 + \\frac{5}{2}x + O(x^2)\n$$\n\nSo as $x \\to 0^+$, expression → $-5$, and for tiny $x$, say $x < 10^{-100}$, the error is less than $0.1$ (since next term is $\\frac{5}{2}x < 2.5 \\times 10^{-100} \\ll 0.1$).\n\nSo $c = -5$, which is a nonzero integer.\n\nThus $(p, c) = (-1, -5)$.\n\nDouble-check: Is there any other $p$ that could work?\n\nIf $p+1 > 0$, then expression → 0, so $c = 0$, but problem says $c \\ne 0$.\n\nIf $p+1 < 0$, i.e., $p < -1$, then $x^{p+1} \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to 0^+$, so unbounded → no finite $c$.\n\nSo only possibility is $p = -1$, giving limit $-5$.\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 2 is $(-1, -5)$.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n- Problem 1: $e = b - 16 = 16 - 16 = 0$\n\n- Problem 2: $(p, c) = (-1, -5)$\n\nNow format as JSON.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: In a random knockout tournament with 32 players, the probability that two specific players meet is 2/32 = 1/16.
