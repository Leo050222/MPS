  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\nWe are told:\n\n- $ f: \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0} $\n- $ f(2) = 0 $\n- $ f(3) > 0 $, and it's an integer → so $ f(3) \\ge 1 $\n- $ f(9999) = 3333 $\n- For all positive integers $ m,n $:\n  $$\n  f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) \\in \\{0,1\\}\n  $$\n  i.e., $ f(m+n) = f(m) + f(n) $ or $ f(m) + f(n) + 1 $\n\nWe are to find $ k = f(3) + 1 $, not $ f(1982) $.\n\nSo first, determine possible values of $ f(3) $, using the functional condition and known values.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- $ a = f(1) $. Since domain is positive integers and codomain is non-negative integers, $ a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0} $.\n\nWe know $ f(2) = 0 $. But $ f(2) = f(1+1) $, so:\n$$\nf(2) = f(1) + f(1) + \\varepsilon_1 = 2a + \\varepsilon_1,\n$$\nwhere $ \\varepsilon_1 \\in \\{0,1\\} $. So:\n$$\n2a + \\varepsilon_1 = 0.\n$$\nSince $ a \\ge 0 $, and $ \\varepsilon_1 \\in \\{0,1\\} $, only possibility is $ a = 0 $, $ \\varepsilon_1 = 0 $. So:\n$$\nf(1) = 0.\n$$\n\nNow compute $ f(3) = f(2+1) $. Then:\n$$\nf(3) = f(2) + f(1) + \\varepsilon_2 = 0 + 0 + \\varepsilon_2 = \\varepsilon_2 \\in \\{0,1\\}.\n$$\nBut we’re told $ f(3) > 0 $, so $ f(3) = 1 $. Therefore:\n$$\nk = f(3) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n$$\n\nWait — but hold on! Is this consistent with $ f(9999) = 3333 $? Let's verify.\n\nIf $ f(1) = 0 $, $ f(2) = 0 $, $ f(3) = 1 $, then what about $ f(4) = f(3+1) = f(3)+f(1)+\\varepsilon = 1 + 0 + \\varepsilon = 1 $ or $ 2 $. Similarly, growth is at most linear with slope ~1/3? Because $ f(9999) = 3333 = 9999 / 3 $. So maybe $ f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor $?\n\nCheck: $ f(1) = 0 $, $ f(2) = 0 $, $ f(3) = 1 $, $ f(4) = \\lfloor 4/3 \\rfloor = 1 $, $ f(5) = 1 $, $ f(6) = 2 $, etc.\n\nDoes $ f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor $ satisfy the condition?\n\nLet’s test $ f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) \\in \\{0,1\\} $.\n\nRecall identity: for floor function,\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m+n}{3} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{3} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor \\in \\{0,1\\}.\n$$\n\nYes! Because $ \\left\\lfloor x+y \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor x \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor y \\right\\rfloor \\in \\{0,1\\} $ always (since fractional parts sum to < 2). Here $ x = m/3, y = n/3 $, so $ x+y = (m+n)/3 $, and the difference is either 0 or 1.\n\nSo $ f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor $ satisfies the condition.\n\nCheck given values:\n\n- $ f(2) = \\lfloor 2/3 \\rfloor = 0 $ ✅  \n- $ f(3) = \\lfloor 3/3 \\rfloor = 1 > 0 $ ✅  \n- $ f(9999) = \\lfloor 9999/3 \\rfloor = 3333 $ ✅  \n\nAlso codomain is non-negative integers ✅.\n\nSo $ f(3) = 1 $, thus $ k = f(3) + 1 = 2 $.\n\nIs there any other possible function satisfying the constraints? Suppose $ f(3) = 2 $. Then since $ f(3) = f(2+1) = f(2)+f(1)+\\varepsilon = 0 + 0 + \\varepsilon = \\varepsilon $, and $ \\varepsilon \\in \\{0,1\\} $, so $ f(3) $ cannot be 2. So indeed $ f(3) = 1 $ is forced.\n\nThus answer to Problem 1 is **2**.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\nWe have 9 points in space, no four coplanar — but that geometric condition likely just ensures general position; for graph-theoretic coloring, it may be irrelevant except to avoid degeneracies. The key is:\n\n- There are $ \\binom{9}{2} = 36 $ pairs → 36 edges total.\n- Each edge is colored **red**, **blue**, or **uncolored**.\n- We color *exactly* $ n $ edges (i.e., choose $ n $ edges to color, each gets red or blue).\n- We want the **smallest** $ n $ such that **any** coloring of $ n $ edges (with red/blue only) **must contain** a monochromatic triangle (i.e., 3 vertices all pairwise connected by edges of same color — red or blue).\n\nThis is a Ramsey-type extremal problem: what is the minimal number of edges that forces a monochromatic triangle in a 2-coloring of a subset of edges of $ K_9 $?\n\nEquivalently: What is the maximum number of edges one can 2-color (red/blue) in $ K_9 $ **without** creating a monochromatic triangle? Then $ n $ is one more than that maximum.\n\nLet $ ex(9; \\text{mono-triangle}) $ be the maximum number of edges in a red-blue edge-coloring of a graph on 9 vertices with **no monochromatic triangle**.\n\nThen answer is $ n = ex(9; \\text{mono-triangle}) + 1 $.\n\nThis is related to the concept of **Ramsey-Turán theory**, but more concretely, it's the extremal function for 2-colorings avoiding monochromatic $ K_3 $.\n\nThere is known result: The maximum number of edges in a graph on $ v $ vertices whose edges can be 2-colored without monochromatic triangle is bounded.\n\nBut perhaps better approach: Use known Ramsey numbers.\n\nThe classical Ramsey number $ R(3,3) = 6 $: any 2-coloring of $ K_6 $ yields a monochromatic triangle.\n\nBut here we don’t need to color *all* edges — only some. So we ask: what’s the largest number of edges we can 2-color in $ K_9 $ without forcing a mono triangle?\n\nThis is equivalent to: what’s the maximum size of a **$ K_3 $-free 2-edge-colored graph**, i.e., a graph whose edges are partitioned into red and blue, neither red nor blue subgraph contains $ K_3 $.\n\nSo let $ G $ be graph on 9 vertices, edge set partitioned into red $ R $ and blue $ B $, with $ R $ triangle-free and $ B $ triangle-free.\n\nWe want max $ |R| + |B| $, where both $ R $ and $ B $ are triangle-free graphs on same vertex set.\n\nSo problem reduces to: what is the maximum number of edges in the union of two triangle-free graphs on 9 vertices?\n\nThis is a known extremal problem.\n\nLet $ \\mathrm{ex}(n, K_3) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor $, Turán’s theorem: maximum edges in triangle-free graph on $ n $ vertices is $ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor $.\n\nFor $ n = 9 $, $ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{81}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 20.25 \\right\\rfloor = 20 $.\n\nSo each of red and blue can have at most 20 edges.\n\nBut can we achieve $ |R| = |B| = 20 $? That would give 40 edges, but total possible edges in $ K_9 $ is only 36. So upper bound is 36.\n\nBut can we partition (or select subset of) 36 edges into red/blue with both parts triangle-free? No — because if all 36 edges were present and 2-colored, by Ramsey $ R(3,3)=6 $, any 2-coloring of $ K_6 $ has mono triangle, so certainly $ K_9 $’s full 2-coloring must have one. So full 36 is impossible.\n\nSo we want largest $ m $ such that there exists a graph $ G $ on 9 vertices with $ m $ edges, and a 2-coloring of its edges with no monochromatic triangle.\n\nEquivalently: largest $ m $ such that $ G $ is the union of two triangle-free graphs.\n\nLet $ f(n) = \\max \\{ |E(G)| : G = R \\cup B, R \\cap B = \\emptyset, R,B \\text{ triangle-free} \\} $.\n\nThis is studied; it's called the **bipartite decomposition number**, but more precisely, it's the maximum number of edges in a graph with bipartite edge-cover? Not exactly.\n\nActually, a classic result: Goodman (1959) gave minimum number of monochromatic triangles in a 2-coloring of $ K_n $, but we need extremal: maximum edges without *any* mono triangle.\n\nKnown values? Let's try small constructions.\n\nSuppose we make red graph bipartite (hence triangle-free), blue graph also bipartite.\n\nMaximum edges in bipartite graph on 9 vertices is $ \\lfloor 9/2 \\rfloor \\cdot \\lceil 9/2 \\rceil = 4 \\cdot 5 = 20 $, same as Turán.\n\nSo if we take red = complete bipartite $ K_{4,5} $ (20 edges), triangle-free.\n\nWhat remains? Total edges 36 − 20 = 16 edges uncolored (if we only color red). But we can color some of remaining edges blue, as long as blue is triangle-free.\n\nThe complement of $ K_{4,5} $ in $ K_9 $ consists of edges inside the part of size 4 and inside the part of size 5: i.e., $ \\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{5}{2} = 6 + 10 = 16 $ edges.\n\nCan we color all 16 as blue? Are those 16 edges triangle-free? The subgraph induced by those 16 edges is the disjoint union of $ K_4 $ and $ K_5 $. Both contain many triangles! So blue would have triangles — not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot take all complement.\n\nInstead, pick red and blue both as bipartite graphs with different partitions.\n\nStandard construction: use two orthogonal bipartitions.\n\nBut perhaps best known value: For $ n = 9 $, the maximum number of edges in a 2-colorable (red/blue) graph without monochromatic triangle is **32**? Let's search reasoning.\n\nAlternative idea: Use probabilistic or known extremal results.\n\nI recall a result: The maximum number of edges in a graph on $ n $ vertices that can be 2-edge-colored without monochromatic triangle is $ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{3} \\right\\rfloor $. Is that true?\n\nCheck for $ n = 6 $: $ \\lfloor 36/3 \\rfloor = 12 $. But $ K_6 $ has 15 edges, and any 2-coloring has mono triangle, but maybe a subgraph with 12 edges can avoid? Not sure.\n\nWait — another angle: This problem is identical to finding the 2-color Ramsey-Turán number.\n\nBut perhaps look for known answer.\n\nActually, this problem appears in contests. Let me think differently.\n\nWe want smallest $ n $ such that any red/blue coloring of *any* $ n $-edge subset of $ K_9 $ contains a monochromatic triangle.\n\nEquivalently, largest $ m $ such that there exists an $ m $-edge graph on 9 vertices whose edges can be 2-colored with no mono triangle. Then $ n = m + 1 $.\n\nSo what’s the largest triangle-free-by-color graph?\n\nSuppose we take red graph to be triangle-free with $ e_R $ edges, blue graph triangle-free with $ e_B $ edges, disjoint edge sets.\n\nSo $ e_R + e_B = m $, and both $ e_R \\le 20 $, $ e_B \\le 20 $, but also they must be on same vertex set with no overlapping edges.\n\nTo maximize sum, we want both close to 20, but their edge sets disjoint.\n\nCan we find two triangle-free graphs on 9 vertices with disjoint edges totaling more than, say, 30?\n\nMaximum possible is 36, but as said, impossible.\n\nKnown extremal construction: Take red = $ K_{4,5} $ (20 edges), which uses all edges between parts A (size 4) and B (size 5). Then remaining edges are within A and within B: $ \\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{5}{2} = 6 + 10 = 16 $. To make blue triangle-free, we can take a triangle-free subgraph of those 16. The subgraph on A is $ K_4 $, max triangle-free subgraph has at most $ \\lfloor 4^2/4 \\rfloor = 4 $ edges (e.g., $ C_4 $). Similarly, on B ($ K_5 $), max triangle-free is $ \\lfloor 25/4 \\rfloor = 6 $. So blue can have up to $ 4 + 6 = 10 $ edges. So total $ 20 + 10 = 30 $.\n\nCan we do better with different red graph?\n\nSuppose red is not complete bipartite, but something else.\n\nAnother idea: Use three parts. Suppose partition vertices into three sets of sizes as equal as possible: 3,3,3. Then make red edges between group 1 and 2, blue edges between group 2 and 3, and maybe some more? But need to avoid triangles.\n\nIf red = all edges between group 1 and 2: $ 3 \\times 3 = 9 $ edges.\n\nBlue = all edges between group 2 and 3: 9 edges.\n\nThen total 18. Less than 30.\n\nNot good.\n\nBetter: Use bipartition for red, and another bipartition for blue, arranged so their union is large.\n\nSuppose red is $ K_{4,5} $ (20 edges) as before.\n\nBlue: instead of restricting to within parts, use some cross edges but carefully.\n\nBut red already uses all cross edges between 4-set and 5-set, so blue can only use edges inside the 4-set or inside 5-set.\n\nSo blue is confined to those 16 edges.\n\nMax triangle-free on 4 vertices: $ \\lfloor 4^2/4 \\rfloor = 4 $, achieved by $ C_4 $ or $ K_{2,2} $.\n\nOn 5 vertices: max triangle-free is $ \\lfloor 25/4 \\rfloor = 6 $, achieved by $ K_{2,3} $ (which has $ 2 \\times 3 = 6 $ edges).\n\nSo blue can have 4 + 6 = 10 edges.\n\nTotal = 30.\n\nCan we get 31? Suppose red has 19 edges (still triangle-free), freeing up 1 more edge in the cut, which could be used by blue in a way that allows blue to gain more than 1? Unlikely, since internal edges are limited.\n\nIs 30 achievable? Yes: red = $ K_{4,5} $ minus one edge → 19 edges; then remaining edges: 16 + 1 = 17, and maybe blue can take 12? But $ K_4 $ has only 6 edges total; triangle-free subgraph max 4. $ K_5 $ has 10 edges; triangle-free max 6. So still 10. So 19 + 10 = 29 < 30.\n\nSo 30 seems achievable and likely maximal.\n\nBut let's verify if 31 is possible.\n\nSuppose we choose red graph as $ K_{3,6} $: bipartite, 3×6 = 18 edges.\n\nRemaining edges: total 36 − 18 = 18, consisting of $ \\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{6}{2} = 3 + 15 = 18 $. Within 3-set: only 3 edges (a triangle!), so to keep blue triangle-free, can take at most 2 edges (since 3 edges on 3 vertices is triangle). Within 6-set: max triangle-free is $ \\lfloor 36/4 \\rfloor = 9 $. So blue can have at most 2 + 9 = 11. Total = 18 + 11 = 29.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo $ K_{4,5} $ seems best.\n\nThus max $ m = 30 $.\n\nHence smallest $ n $ forcing monochromatic triangle is $ 31 $.\n\nBut wait — is there a known result? Let me check small cases.\n\nFor $ n = 6 $, $ R(3,3) = 6 $ means any 2-coloring of all $ \\binom{6}{2} = 15 $ edges has mono triangle. But what's the max edges without mono triangle? For $ K_5 $, can we 2-color all 10 edges without mono triangle? Yes: $ K_5 $ can be decomposed into two 5-cycles? Not sure. Actually, the Ramsey number tells us that with 6 vertices, unavoidable. But for fewer edges.\n\nI found online (or recall) that the maximum number of edges in a graph on $ n $ vertices that can be 2-colored without monochromatic triangle is $ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{3} \\right\\rfloor $. For $ n = 9 $, $ \\lfloor 81/3 \\rfloor = 27 $. But we already have a construction with 30, so that formula is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps it's $ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{2} \\right\\rfloor $? No, 40 > 36.\n\nLet me think of upper bound.\n\nSuppose $ G $ is graph with $ m $ edges, 2-colored red/blue, no mono triangle.\n\nThen red graph has $ r $ edges, triangle-free ⇒ $ r \\le \\lfloor n^2/4 \\rfloor = 20 $.\n\nSimilarly $ b \\le 20 $.\n\nSo $ m = r + b \\le 40 $, but $ m \\le 36 $, so trivial.\n\nBut more tightly, the red and blue edges are disjoint, but their union's structure may impose more.\n\nHowever, there's a theorem: The maximum number of edges in a $ K_3 $-free 2-edge-colored graph on $ n $ vertices is $ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{3} \\right\\rfloor $ — no, that's for something else.\n\nWait, consider the following: In any graph, the number of triangles is related to edge distribution, but we need zero monochromatic triangles.\n\nPerhaps use Goodman's formula: In any 2-coloring of $ K_n $, number of monochromatic triangles is at least $ \\binom{n}{3} - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil (n-2) $ or something — but that's for full coloring.\n\nBut we don't have full coloring.\n\nLet’s instead search for known answer.\n\nThis problem is from Putnam or similar. I recall a similar problem: For 9 points, smallest $ n $ such that any red/blue coloring of $ n $ edges yields mono triangle is **33**? Or 32?\n\nWait, another approach: Use extremal example — the complete bipartite graph $ K_{4,5} $ has 20 edges, triangle-free. If we take red = $ K_{4,5} $, and blue = another triangle-free graph on remaining edges. As before, 10 more → 30.\n\nCan we add one more edge to blue without creating triangle? Suppose in the 4-set, we have $ K_{2,2} = C_4 $ (4 edges, triangle-free). Can we add a 5th edge? $ K_4 $ has 6 edges; adding any 5th edge to $ C_4 $ creates a triangle? $ C_4 $ plus a diagonal is $ K_4 $ minus one edge, which is triangle-free? No: $ C_4 $ with one diagonal creates two triangles? Let's see: vertices a,b,c,d in cycle a-b-c-d-a. Add diagonal a-c: then triangle a-b-c and a-c-d? a-b-c: edges a-b, b-c, a-c — yes, triangle. So cannot add diagonal. So max in $ K_4 $ is 4.\n\nSimilarly in $ K_5 $, $ K_{2,3} $ has 6 edges; adding any 7th edge creates triangle? $ K_{2,3} $ is bipartite, so triangle-free; adding an edge within the part of size 3 creates triangle? Yes, because if you add edge between two vertices in the size-3 part, and they have common neighbor in size-2 part, forms triangle. Since each vertex in size-3 part is connected to both in size-2 part, yes — so adding any intra-part edge creates triangle. So max is 6.\n\nThus blue max 10, red max 20, total 30.\n\nThus $ m = 30 $ is achievable and maximal.\n\nTherefore, with 30 edges, it's possible to avoid mono triangle; with 31, impossible.\n\nSo answer is $ \\boxed{31} $.\n\nBut let me verify with a concrete example.\n\nTake vertices partitioned into A = {1,2,3,4}, B = {5,6,7,8,9}.\n\nRed edges: all between A and B: 4×5 = 20 edges.\n\nBlue edges: in A, take a 4-cycle: 1-2-3-4-1 → edges {12,23,34,41} = 4 edges.\n\nIn B, take complete bipartite $ K_{2,3} $: split B into {5,6} and {7,8,9}, add all edges between: 5-7,5-8,5-9,6-7,6-8,6-9 = 6 edges.\n\nTotal blue = 4 + 6 = 10.\n\nNo red triangle (bipartite), no blue triangle (both parts bipartite). So total colored edges = 30, no mono triangle.\n\nAdd any 31st edge: it must be an uncolored edge. Uncolored edges are:\n\n- In A: $ \\binom{4}{2} = 6 $ total, we used 4, so 2 left: say 1-3 and 2-4 (the diagonals).\n\n- In B: $ \\binom{5}{2} = 10 $ total, we used 6, so 4 left: the edges within {5,6} (just 5-6), and within {7,8,9}: $ \\binom{3}{2} = 3 $ edges: 7-8,7-9,8-9.\n\nSo uncolored edges: 2 + 4 = 6 edges.\n\nIf we color any of these as red: but red is only defined between A and B; adding an edge within A or B to red would make red non-bipartite? But red doesn't have to stay bipartite; we just need red triangle-free. However, adding edge 1-3 to red: now in A, we have vertices 1,2,3 with red edges 1-2, 2-3, 1-3 → triangle! So cannot add to red.\n\nSimilarly, adding 5-6 to red: 5 and 6 are both in B; they have common neighbors in A, say 1; so red edges 5-1, 6-1, and 5-6 form triangle. Since all A-B edges are red, yes: 5-1, 6-1, 5-6 would be red triangle. So adding any intra-A or intra-B edge to red creates red triangle.\n\nSimilarly, if we add to blue: say add 1-3 to blue. In A, blue has C_4: 1-2-3-4-1. Adding 1-3 creates triangle 1-2-3 (edges 1-2,2-3,1-3 all blue). So yes, triangle.\n\nAdd 5-6 to blue: in B, blue has only edges from {5,6} to {7,8,9}, no edges within {5,6} or within {7,8,9}. So adding 5-6: does it create triangle? 5 and 6 both connect to 7, so edges 5-7, 6-7, 5-6 all blue → triangle. Yes.\n\nSimilarly, adding 7-8: 7 and 8 both connect to 5 and 6, so 5-7,5-8,7-8 → triangle.\n\nSo indeed, any additional edge, regardless of color, creates a monochromatic triangle.\n\nThus 31 is indeed minimal.\n\nSo answer to Problem 2 is **31**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Using f(2) = 0 and the functional equation f(m+n) = f(m) + f(n) or f(m) + f(n) + 1, we deduce f(1) = 0. Then f(3) = f(2+1) = f(2) + f(1) + ε = 0 + 0 + ε, where ε ∈ {0,1}. Since f(3) > 0, ε = 1, so f(3) = 1. Thus k = f(3) + 1 = 2. This is consistent with f(n) = ⌊n/3⌋, which satisfies all conditions including f(9999) = 3333. Problem 2: We seek the smallest n such that any red/blue coloring of n edges among the 36 edges of K₉ forces a monochromatic triangle. The maximum number of edges that can be 2-colored without a monochromatic triangle is 30, achieved by taking red as the complete bipartite graph K₄,₅ (20 edges) and blue as a triangle-free graph on the remaining 16 edges (e.g., a 4-cycle on the 4-set and K₂,₃ on the 5-set, totaling 10 edges). Adding any 31st edge forces a monochromatic triangle, so n = 31.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"31\"\n}",
