  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> Let $x_n = \\binom{2n}{n}$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. Prove there exist infinitely many finite sets $A, B$ of positive integers, satisfying $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$, and  \n> $$\n\\frac{\\prod_{i \\in A} x_i}{\\prod_{j \\in B} x_j} = 2012.\n$$\n> Instead of proving the existence... simply find $m = d + 98$, where $d$ is the value of the central binomial coefficient sequence at its initial positive integer argument.\n\nInterpretation:\n\n- The sequence is defined for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$, i.e., positive integers: $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$\n- \"Initial positive integer argument\" means $n = 1$.\n- So $d = x_1 = \\binom{2 \\cdot 1}{1} = \\binom{2}{1} = 2$.\n- Then $m = d + 98 = 2 + 98 = 100$.\n\n✅ That’s straightforward.\n\nSo **Answer 1 = 100**\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> Suppose that $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \\ldots , (a_{100}, b_{100})$ are distinct ordered pairs of nonnegative integers. Let $N$ denote the number of pairs of integers $(i, j)$ satisfying $1 \\le i < j \\le 100$ and  \n> $$\n|a_i b_j - a_j b_i| = 1.\n$$\n> Determine the largest possible value of $N$ over all possible choices of the 100 ordered pairs.\n\nThis expression $|a_i b_j - a_j b_i|$ is the absolute value of the **determinant** of the $2 \\times 2$ matrix with rows $(a_i, b_i)$ and $(a_j, b_j)$. Geometrically, it equals the area of the parallelogram spanned by vectors $\\vec{v}_i = (a_i, b_i)$ and $\\vec{v}_j = (a_j, b_j)$. So $|a_i b_j - a_j b_i| = 1$ means the two vectors form a **unimodular pair**, i.e., they generate the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ — their integer linear combinations cover all of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. Equivalently, the vectors are *primitive* and form a basis of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nKey facts:\n\n- For two integer vectors $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$, $|ad - bc| = 1$ iff the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}$ is in $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ (up to sign).\n- So we want as many unordered pairs $\\{i,j\\}$ as possible such that the determinant is ±1.\n\nWe need to choose 100 distinct ordered pairs $(a_k, b_k) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}^2$ (nonnegative integers), maximizing the number of pairs with determinant ±1.\n\nLet’s think about structure.\n\nObservation: If we fix one vector, say $(1,0)$, then which vectors $(a,b)$ satisfy $|1 \\cdot b - 0 \\cdot a| = |b| = 1$? So $b = 1$. So any $(a,1)$ works: determinant = $|1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot a| = 1$. So $(1,0)$ pairs with all $(a,1)$, $a \\ge 0$, giving infinitely many — but we only need 100 total points.\n\nBut we need *distinct* pairs, and maximize number of determinant-1 pairs.\n\nBetter idea: Use vectors from the **Farey sequence** or **primitive integer vectors**, since determinant condition relates to coprimality.\n\nNote: For two vectors $u = (a,b), v = (c,d)$, $|ad - bc| = 1$ implies that both vectors are primitive (i.e., $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(c,d) = 1$), because if, say, $d = \\gcd(a,b) > 1$, then $d$ divides $ad - bc$, so can’t be 1.\n\nSo all vectors must be primitive.\n\nAlso, geometrically, two primitive integer vectors have determinant ±1 iff they are adjacent in the Stern-Brocot tree or Farey sequence — i.e., their slopes are consecutive fractions in some Farey sequence.\n\nIndeed, suppose $b > 0$, $d > 0$, and consider slopes $a/b$ and $c/d$. Then $|ad - bc| = 1$ is exactly the condition that $a/b$ and $c/d$ are **adjacent** in some Farey sequence (i.e., no fraction between them with denominator ≤ max(b,d)).\n\nSo the problem reduces to: choose 100 fractions $a/b$ (in lowest terms, with $a,b \\ge 0$, not both zero), plus possibly vectors with $b = 0$ or $a = 0$, to maximize number of adjacent pairs in the Farey sense.\n\nBut note domain: nonnegative integers only ⇒ vectors lie in first quadrant including axes.\n\nImportant special cases:\n\n- $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$: determinant = $|1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot0| = 1$ ✅\n- $(1,0)$ and $(k,1)$: determinant = $|1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot k| = 1$ ✅ for any $k$\n- $(0,1)$ and $(1,k)$: determinant = $|0\\cdot k - 1\\cdot1| = 1$ ✅\n\nSo $(1,0)$ forms determinant-1 pairs with *all* vectors of form $(a,1)$, $a \\ge 0$: that’s infinitely many — but we only pick 100 total.\n\nSimilarly, $(0,1)$ pairs with all $(1,b)$.\n\nBut we must ensure all 100 pairs are distinct.\n\nLet’s try constructing a set with high pairwise determinant-1 count.\n\nIdea: Use the set:\n- $(1,0)$\n- $(0,1)$\n- And all $(1, k)$ for $k = 1$ to $98$: that’s 98 more → total = 100.\n\nWait: $(1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,98)$ → that’s 1 + 1 + 98 = 100.\n\nNow count how many pairs $(i,j)$ satisfy $|a_i b_j - a_j b_i| = 1$.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- $v_0 = (1,0)$\n- $v_1 = (0,1)$\n- $v_k = (1, k)$ for $k = 1$ to $98$\n\nSo indices: total 100 vectors.\n\nCompute determinant between:\n\n1. $v_0 = (1,0)$ and $v_k = (1,k)$: $|1\\cdot k - 0 \\cdot 1| = |k| = k$. So equals 1 only when $k = 1$. So only $v_1 = (1,1)$ gives det = 1 with $v_0$.\n\n2. $v_1 = (0,1)$ and $v_k = (1,k)$: $|0\\cdot k - 1 \\cdot 1| = |-1| = 1$ for all $k$. So $v_1$ pairs with all $v_k$, $k = 1$ to $98$: that’s 98 pairs.\n\n3. Between $v_i = (1,i)$ and $v_j = (1,j)$, $i \\ne j$: determinant = $|1\\cdot j - i \\cdot 1| = |j - i|$. So equals 1 only when $|i - j| = 1$, i.e., consecutive $k$'s. There are 97 such adjacent pairs among $k = 1$ to $98$: (1,2), (2,3), ..., (97,98).\n\n4. $v_0$ and $v_1$: determinant = $|1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot0| = 1$ ✅ → 1 more.\n\nSo total so far:\n\n- $v_0$–$v_1$: 1  \n- $v_0$–$v_k$: only $k=1$ → already counted above? Wait $v_1$ is $(0,1)$, and $v_k$ for $k=1$ to $98$ are $(1,k)$. So $v_0$–$(1,1)$: determinant = $|1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot1| = 1$ → that’s another pair: $v_0$ and $v_2$? Wait labeling conflict.\n\nLet me re-label clearly.\n\nLet’s define:\n\n- $u_0 = (1,0)$  \n- $u_1 = (0,1)$  \n- $u_2 = (1,1)$  \n- $u_3 = (1,2)$  \n- …  \n- $u_{99} = (1,98)$  \n\nSo total: $u_0, u_1, u_2, ..., u_{99}$ → 100 vectors.\n\nNow compute all unordered pairs $(i,j), i<j$, with determinant 1.\n\nCase analysis:\n\n- Pairs involving $u_0 = (1,0)$:\n\n  - With $u_1 = (0,1)$: $|1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot0| = 1$ ✅  \n  - With $u_k = (1,k)$, $k = 1$ to $98$: determinant = $|1\\cdot k - 0\\cdot1| = k$. So only $k = 1$ gives 1 → i.e., $u_2 = (1,1)$. So $u_0$–$u_2$: 1 pair.\n\n- Pairs involving $u_1 = (0,1)$:\n\n  - With $u_0$: already counted.  \n  - With $u_k = (1,k)$: determinant = $|0\\cdot k - 1\\cdot1| = 1$ always ✅. So $u_1$ pairs with $u_2$ through $u_{99}$: that’s 98 vectors → 98 pairs.\n\n- Pairs among $u_2$ to $u_{99}$, i.e., $(1,k)$ and $(1,\\ell)$, $k < \\ell$: determinant = $|1\\cdot \\ell - k \\cdot 1| = |\\ell - k| = 1$ only when $\\ell = k+1$. There are 97 such consecutive pairs: $(u_2,u_3), (u_3,u_4), ..., (u_{98},u_{99})$.\n\nNow sum:\n\n- $u_0$–$u_1$: 1  \n- $u_0$–$u_2$: 1  \n- $u_1$–$u_2$ to $u_1$–$u_{99}$: 98  \n- Consecutive $(1,k)$–$(1,k+1)$: 97  \n\nBut wait: $u_1$–$u_2$ is $(0,1)$ and $(1,1)$: determinant = $|0\\cdot1 - 1\\cdot1| = 1$ ✅ — included in the 98.\n\nAlso $u_0$–$u_2 = (1,0)$–$(1,1)$: determinant = $|1\\cdot1 - 0\\cdot1| = 1$ ✅.\n\nAre there overlaps? No, all are distinct pairs.\n\nSo total =  \n- $u_0$–$u_1$: 1  \n- $u_0$–$u_2$: 1  \n- $u_1$ with $u_2$ to $u_{99}$: that’s $u_1$–$u_2$, $u_1$–$u_3$, ..., $u_1$–$u_{99}$ → 98 pairs. Note $u_2$ is included here.  \n- Consecutive $u_i$–$u_j$ among the $(1,k)$ group: $u_2$–$u_3$, ..., $u_{98}$–$u_{99}$: 97 pairs.\n\nSo total = 1 + 1 + 98 + 97 = 197.\n\nBut is this maximal? Maybe we can do better.\n\nAlternative idea: Use **all vectors $(a,b)$ with $a,b \\in \\{0,1\\}$**: only 4 vectors: $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)$. But $(0,0)$ is problematic: determinant with anything is 0, and also problem says *nonnegative integers*, but does $(0,0)$ allowed? It says \"ordered pairs of nonnegative integers\", so yes, but then $|a_i b_j - a_j b_i| = 0$ always when either is $(0,0)$, so useless. Also, pairs must be *distinct*, but $(0,0)$ is just one. Better to avoid zero vector.\n\nStandard trick in such olympiad problems: The maximum number of pairs with determinant ±1 among $n$ integer vectors in plane is achieved by taking **a set of vectors lying on two lines**, e.g., x-axis and y-axis, or using unimodular rows.\n\nBut let’s search known results or bounds.\n\nNote: The condition $|a_i b_j - a_j b_i| = 1$ implies the two vectors form a basis of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, so in particular, they are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{R}$, and both nonzero.\n\nSo all vectors must be nonzero.\n\nAlso, for a fixed vector $v$, how many $w$ satisfy $|\\det(v,w)| = 1$?\n\nIf $v = (a,b) \\ne (0,0)$, then solutions $w = (x,y)$ to $|ay - bx| = 1$ is a linear Diophantine equation. For fixed $(a,b)$, the number of solutions $(x,y)$ in nonnegative integers is infinite if $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$, but we are selecting only 100 total.\n\nBut we want to maximize number of *pairs*, not solutions per vector.\n\nThis resembles extremal combinatorics on determinants.\n\nKnown fact: In the grid $[0,N] \\times [0,N]$, the maximum number of pairs with determinant ±1 is $O(n^{3/2})$? Not sure.\n\nBut maybe the optimal construction is a **chain**: choose vectors such that each consecutive pair has determinant 1, and also connect to a common vector.\n\nOur earlier construction gave 197.\n\nCan we get more?\n\nTry using $(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,99)$: that’s 100 vectors: $(0,1)$ and $(1,k)$ for $k = 1$ to $99$.\n\nThen:\n\n- $(0,1)$ with each $(1,k)$: determinant = $|0*k - 1*1| = 1$ → 99 pairs  \n- Among $(1,k)$ and $(1,\\ell)$: $|k - \\ell| = 1$ → 98 pairs (since k from 1 to 99 → 98 adjacent)\n\nTotal = 99 + 98 = 197 again.\n\nSame.\n\nWhat if we use $(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,99)$: 100 vectors.\n\nThen:\n\n- $(1,0)$ with $(1,k)$: determinant = $k$, so only $k = 1$ gives 1 → 1 pair  \n- Among $(1,k)$: 98 adjacent pairs  \n- Total = 1 + 98 = 99 → worse.\n\nSo best is to include $(0,1)$ and all $(1,k)$.\n\nBut can we add a second “hub” vector?\n\nSuppose we take two hub vectors: $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$, and then vectors $(1,k)$ for $k = 1$ to $97$: total = 2 + 97 = 99 → need one more. Add $(2,1)$? Let's see.\n\nBut likely diminishing returns.\n\nAlternatively, consider using vectors from the **standard basis and elementary matrices**, but constrained to nonnegative entries.\n\nAnother idea: Use all vectors $(F_{k}, F_{k+1})$, consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Because determinant of $(F_i, F_{i+1})$ and $(F_j, F_{j+1})$ is $F_i F_{j+1} - F_{j} F_{i+1} = (-1)^{j+1} F_{|i-j|}$ (Cassini-type identity). So $|det| = F_{|i-j|}$. So equals 1 only when $|i-j| = 1$ or $2$? $F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2$, so only adjacent give 1. So again chain-like: only $n-1$ pairs.\n\nWorse than 197.\n\nSo 197 seems plausible.\n\nBut wait — is 197 achievable with *distinct* nonnegative integer pairs?\n\nIn our construction: $(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,99)$ — that’s 100 vectors:\n\n- $(0,1)$  \n- $(1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,99)$ → 99 vectors\n\nAll distinct? Yes.\n\nAll nonnegative? Yes.\n\nNow count pairs $(i,j)$, $i<j$, with $|a_i b_j - a_j b_i| = 1$.\n\nList:\n\n- Pair $(0,1)$ with each $(1,k)$: determinant = $|0*k - 1*1| = 1$ → 99 pairs.\n\n- Pairs among $(1,k)$ and $(1,\\ell)$: determinant = $|1*\\ell - k*1| = |\\ell - k|$. Equals 1 iff $|\\ell - k| = 1$. With $k,\\ell \\in \\{1,2,...,99\\}$, number of unordered pairs with difference 1 is $99 - 1 = 98$.\n\nNo other pairs (since only these 100 vectors).\n\nSo total $N = 99 + 98 = 197$.\n\nCan we get more?\n\nWhat if we add vectors like $(2,1)$? Check determinant with $(0,1)$: $|2*1 - 1*0| = 2$ → no. With $(1,1)$: $|2*1 - 1*1| = |2 - 1| = 1$ ✅. With $(1,2)$: $|2*2 - 1*1| = |4 - 1| = 3$. So only connects to some.\n\nProbably doesn’t beat 197.\n\nIs there an upper bound?\n\nEach pair with determinant ±1 corresponds to an edge in a graph on 100 vertices. What's max edges?\n\nNote that for any two distinct vectors $u,v$, if $\\det(u,v) = \\pm 1$, then neither is a multiple of the other, and both are primitive.\n\nMoreover, for a fixed $u$, the set of $v$ with $\\det(u,v) = \\pm 1$ lies on two parallel lines (solutions to linear equation), so infinite, but in practice with nonnegative constraint, still many.\n\nBut globally, is 197 maximum?\n\nWait, known result: This is equivalent to asking for the maximum number of *edges* in a graph whose vertices are points in $\\mathbb{N}_0^2$, with edge when determinant is ±1. For $n$ vertices, the max is $n(n-1)/2$ only if all pairs work, but impossible because, e.g., $(1,0)$ and $(2,0)$ have det 0.\n\nIn fact, if you have three vectors $u,v,w$, can all three pairs have det ±1? Suppose $u = (0,1), v = (1,0), w = (1,1)$. Then:\n\n- $u$–$v$: det = 1  \n- $u$–$w$: det = $|0*1 - 1*1| = 1$  \n- $v$–$w$: det = $|1*1 - 0*1| = 1$  \n\nSo triangle exists! So $K_3$ is possible.\n\nHow many triangles? But we want total edges.\n\nWith 100 vertices, complete graph has $\\binom{100}{2} = 4950$, but impossible.\n\nOur construction has 197.\n\nCan we do better with a different shape?\n\nConsider using all vectors $(a,1)$ for $a = 0$ to $99$: i.e., $(0,1), (1,1), ..., (99,1)$. That’s 100 vectors.\n\nThen:\n\n- Any two $(a,1), (b,1)$: det = $|a*1 - 1*b| = |a - b|$. So equals 1 for consecutive $a$, i.e., 99 pairs.\n\nOnly 99 — worse.\n\nWhat if we take $(a,1)$ and $(b,0)$? But $(b,0)$ with $b > 0$: det with $(a,1)$ is $|b*1 - 0*a| = b$, so only $b = 1$ gives 1. So only $(1,0)$ works.\n\nSo back to earlier.\n\nThus, best is hub-and-spoke with one hub giving 99 edges, and spokes forming a path giving 98 more → 197.\n\nBut wait — in our count, are we double-counting? No: hub–spoke and spoke–spoke are disjoint sets of pairs.\n\nSo $N = 197$.\n\nBut let’s verify small case: suppose $n = 3$: vectors $(0,1), (1,1), (1,2)$. Then pairs:\n\n- $(0,1)$–$(1,1)$: det = 1  \n- $(0,1)$–$(1,2)$: det = 1  \n- $(1,1)$–$(1,2)$: det = |1−2| = 1  \n\nSo all 3 pairs work → $N = 3 = \\binom{3}{2}$. So for $n = 3$, maximum is 3.\n\nOur formula for $n$ vectors: if we take $(0,1)$ and $(1,k)$ for $k = 1$ to $n-1$, then:\n\n- Hub–spoke: $n-1$ pairs  \n- Spoke–spoke adjacent: $n-2$ pairs  \n- Total = $2n - 3$\n\nFor $n = 3$: $2*3 - 3 = 3$ ✅  \nFor $n = 100$: $2*100 - 3 = 197$ ✅\n\nCan we beat $2n - 3$?\n\nSuppose $n = 4$: can we get more than $5$?\n\nTry $(0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)$:\n\nPairs:\n\n- $(0,1)$–$(1,0)$: 1  \n- $(0,1)$–$(1,1)$: 1  \n- $(0,1)$–$(1,2)$: 1  \n- $(1,0)$–$(1,1)$: 1  \n- $(1,0)$–$(1,2)$: 2 → no  \n- $(1,1)$–$(1,2)$: 1  \n\nSo pairs with det 1:  \n$(0,1)-(1,0)$, $(0,1)-(1,1)$, $(0,1)-(1,2)$, $(1,0)-(1,1)$, $(1,1)-(1,2)$ → that’s 5.\n\nSame as $2*4 - 3 = 5$.\n\nAdd $(2,1)$? Then check:\n\n- $(2,1)$–$(0,1)$: $|2*1 - 1*0| = 2$  \n- $(2,1)$–$(1,0)$: $|2*0 - 1*1| = 1$ ✅  \n- $(2,1)$–$(1,1)$: $|2*1 - 1*1| = 1$ ✅  \n- $(2,1)$–$(1,2)$: $|2*2 - 1*1| = |4 - 1| = 3$  \n\nSo adds 2 new pairs. Now n = 5, N = 5 + 2 = 7, while $2*5 - 3 = 7$. Still matches.\n\nSo conjecture: maximum $N = 2n - 3$ for $n \\ge 2$.\n\nThus for $n = 100$, $N_{\\max} = 2*100 - 3 = 197$.\n\nHence **Answer 2 = 197**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers:\n\n- Problem 1: $m = d + 98 = \\binom{2}{1} + 98 = 2 + 98 = 100$  \n- Problem 2: Maximum $N = 197$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The sequence is defined as x_n = C(2n, n) for positive integers n. The initial positive integer argument is n = 1, so d = C(2, 1) = 2. Thus m = d + 98 = 2 + 98 = 100. Problem 2: To maximize the number N of pairs (i, j) with |a_i b_j - a_j b_i| = 1 among 100 distinct nonnegative integer pairs, the optimal construction uses one 'hub' vector (0,1) and 99 'spoke' vectors (1, k) for k = 1 to 99. The hub forms determinant-1 pairs with all spokes (99 pairs), and consecutive spokes (1,k) and (1,k+1) yield determinant |k+1 - k| = 1, giving 98 such pairs. Total N = 99 + 98 = 197.
