  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\nWe need to find α = P(1), where P is an *extremal* cubic polynomial (degree 3), satisfying:\n\n- P has a root in [0,1],\n- max_{x ∈ [0,1]} |P(x)| = 1 (i.e., normalized so its sup-norm on [0,1] is 1),\n- and it maximizes the integral ∫₀¹ |P(x)| dx among all such cubics.\n\nSo we want the cubic that \"spreads out\" its absolute value as much as possible over [0,1], while staying bounded by 1 in absolute value and having at least one root in [0,1].\n\nThis is a classic extremal problem in approximation theory — similar to Chebyshev polynomials, but with an extra constraint: a root in [0,1].\n\nLet’s denote the space:\n\nLet ℱ = { P ∈ ℝ[x] : deg P = 3, ∃ r ∈ [0,1] s.t. P(r) = 0, and ‖P‖_∞,[0,1] = 1 }.\n\nWe want to maximize I(P) = ∫₀¹ |P(x)| dx over ℱ.\n\nBecause of the absolute value, the integral is not linear, but the extremal polynomial will likely be *alternating* — i.e., it attains ±1 at several points in [0,1], changing sign at its root, and possibly having equioscillation behavior.\n\nSince it's degree 3 and must have a root in [0,1], write:\n\nP(x) = a(x − r)(x − s)(x − t), with r ∈ [0,1], and s,t ∈ ℂ or ℝ.\n\nBut to maximize ∫|P| under sup-norm constraint, intuition says the extremal polynomial should attain its maximum absolute value (i.e., ±1) at as many points as possible — ideally 4 points (since degree 3 ⇒ at most 3 turning points ⇒ up to 4 alternations). Chebyshev polynomials of degree n equioscillate n+1 times.\n\nThe Chebyshev polynomial of degree 3 is T₃(x) = 4x³ − 3x, which oscillates between −1 and 1 on [−1,1], attaining ±1 at 4 points: x = cos(0·π/3), cos(1·π/3), cos(2·π/3), cos(3·π/3) = 1, 1/2, −1/2, −1.\n\nBut our domain is [0,1], not [−1,1]. So perhaps we consider a shifted/scaled Chebyshev polynomial on [0,1].\n\nLet’s define φ(x) = 2x − 1, mapping [0,1] → [−1,1]. Then T₃(φ(x)) = T₃(2x−1) is a cubic on [0,1], with sup norm 1, and equioscillates 4 times on [0,1]: at x such that 2x−1 = cos(kπ/3), k = 0,1,2,3 → x = (1 + cos(kπ/3))/2.\n\nCompute those:\n\n- k=0: cos 0 = 1 → x = (1+1)/2 = 1  \n- k=1: cos(π/3) = 1/2 → x = (1 + 1/2)/2 = 3/4  \n- k=2: cos(2π/3) = −1/2 → x = (1 − 1/2)/2 = 1/4  \n- k=3: cos π = −1 → x = (1 − 1)/2 = 0  \n\nSo T₃(2x−1) equioscillates at x = 0, 1/4, 3/4, 1, taking values ±1 alternatingly.\n\nLet’s compute T₃(2x−1):\n\nRecall T₃(t) = 4t³ − 3t.\n\nSo let t = 2x−1:\n\nT₃(2x−1) = 4(2x−1)³ − 3(2x−1)\n\nCompute:\n\n(2x−1)³ = 8x³ − 12x² + 6x − 1  \nSo 4×that = 32x³ − 48x² + 24x − 4  \nThen subtract 3(2x−1) = 6x − 3  \nSo total: 32x³ − 48x² + 24x − 4 − 6x + 3 = 32x³ − 48x² + 18x − 1\n\nSo Q(x) = 32x³ − 48x² + 18x − 1.\n\nCheck values:\n\n- Q(0) = −1  \n- Q(1/4): compute: x = 0.25  \n  32*(1/64) = 0.5  \n  −48*(1/16) = −3  \n  18*(1/4) = 4.5  \n  −1  \n  Sum: 0.5 − 3 + 4.5 − 1 = 1  \n- Q(3/4): x = 0.75  \n  32*(27/64) = (32/64)*27 = 0.5*27 = 13.5  \n  −48*(9/16) = −3*9 = −27  \n  18*(3/4) = 13.5  \n  −1  \n  Sum: 13.5 − 27 + 13.5 − 1 = −1  \n- Q(1) = 32 − 48 + 18 − 1 = 1? 32−48 = −16; −16+18 = 2; 2−1 = 1 ✔️\n\nSo Q alternates: −1, +1, −1, +1 at 0, 1/4, 3/4, 1. So it has *no root* in [0,1]? Let's check sign changes: goes from −1 at 0 to +1 at 1/4 ⇒ root in (0,1/4); then +1 to −1 ⇒ root in (1/4,3/4); then −1 to +1 ⇒ root in (3/4,1). So actually 3 real roots in [0,1]! Indeed, since it's cubic with leading coefficient positive, and values −1, +1, −1, +1, it must cross zero three times. So yes, it has roots in [0,1].\n\nThus Q(x) satisfies the condition: degree 3, root(s) in [0,1], sup norm = 1 on [0,1].\n\nNow compute ∫₀¹ |Q(x)| dx.\n\nBecause Q alternates sign at points 0 < r₁ < r₂ < r₃ < 1, and we know sign pattern: Q(0) = −1, then +1 at 1/4, so first root r₁ ∈ (0,1/4); then goes to −1 at 3/4 ⇒ second root r₂ ∈ (1/4,3/4); then to +1 at 1 ⇒ third root r₃ ∈ (3/4,1).\n\nSo |Q(x)| = −Q(x) on [0,r₁], +Q(x) on [r₁,r₂], −Q(x) on [r₂,r₃], +Q(x) on [r₃,1].\n\nBut integrating |Q| directly is messy unless we know roots.\n\nHowever — is Q the extremal? Possibly not, because the constraint is *at least one root*, not three. Maybe forcing only one root allows more \"mass\" in the integral.\n\nBut often extremal solutions for such L¹ vs L^∞ problems under sign-change constraints are *alternating* polynomials with maximal number of extrema — i.e., equioscillating — due to Chebyshev alternation theorem generalized.\n\nMoreover, the problem says: “the extremal cubic polynomial, normalized so that its maximum absolute value on [0,1] is 1 and having a root in [0,1], that achieves the supremum”.\n\nSo likely it's unique up to sign, and equioscillating.\n\nBut does any cubic with sup norm 1 on [0,1] and exactly one root in [0,1] give larger ∫|P|?\n\nSuppose P has only one real root r ∈ [0,1], and two complex conjugate roots. Then P doesn’t change sign except at r, so |P| = ±P piecewise, and ∫|P| = |∫₀ʳ P + ∫ʳ¹ (−P)| or vice versa. To maximize, maybe best to have P large in magnitude over large subintervals.\n\nBut with sup norm fixed at 1, the most \"spread out\" |P| would be when P is ±1 on large portions — but a cubic can't be constant on an interval unless identically constant, which it's not.\n\nSo again, equioscillation gives maximal \"area under absolute value\".\n\nHence likely Q(x) = T₃(2x−1) is extremal.\n\nBut wait — the problem asks for α = P(1), where P is extremal and normalized to have max |P| = 1 on [0,1].\n\nFrom above, Q(1) = 1.\n\nBut is the extremal unique up to sign? What if we take −Q? Then max |−Q| = 1 still, and −Q(1) = −1. But ∫|−Q| = ∫|Q|, same. So both achieve same integral. So P(1) could be ±1? But the problem says \"the extremal cubic polynomial\", implying perhaps a specific one — maybe the one with positive leading coefficient? Or maybe there's another extremal with different P(1).\n\nWait — maybe the extremal is not the Chebyshev one, because Chebyshev has *three* roots in [0,1], but the constraint is only *at least one*. Perhaps allowing only one root lets the polynomial stay closer to ±1 over more of the interval.\n\nLet’s test simple candidates.\n\n**Candidate 1**: P(x) = x(x−a)(x−b), but normalized.\n\nToo many parameters.\n\nBetter idea: Use symmetry or known results.\n\nI recall a known result: For degree n polynomials on [0,1] with a zero in [0,1], the maximal L¹ norm under sup norm 1 is achieved by the Chebyshev polynomial shifted to [0,1], *provided* it has a zero in [0,1] — which T₃(2x−1) does.\n\nBut let's verify numerically approximate ∫|Q(x)| dx.\n\nWe have Q(x) = 32x³ − 48x² + 18x − 1.\n\nWe know its roots are where Q(x)=0. Since it equioscillates 4 times with alternating signs, and is cubic, it has exactly 3 real roots — let's approximate them.\n\nWe know sign changes:\n\n- Q(0) = −1  \n- Q(0.1) = 32(0.001) − 48(0.01) + 18(0.1) − 1 = 0.032 − 0.48 + 1.8 − 1 = 0.352 > 0 ⇒ root in (0,0.1)  \n- Q(0.2) = 32(0.008) − 48(0.04) + 18(0.2) − 1 = 0.256 − 1.92 + 3.6 − 1 = 0.936  \n- Q(0.3) = 32(0.027) − 48(0.09) + 18(0.3) − 1 = 0.864 − 4.32 + 5.4 − 1 = 0.944  \nWait, but earlier we said Q(1/4 = 0.25) = 1, Q(3/4 = 0.75) = −1, so it goes from +1 at 0.25 down to −1 at 0.75, so must cross zero somewhere in between.\n\nQ(0.5) = 32(0.125) − 48(0.25) + 18(0.5) − 1 = 4 − 12 + 9 − 1 = 0. So x = 0.5 is a root! Nice.\n\nSo r₂ = 1/2.\n\nThen factor Q(x) = (x − 1/2) × quadratic.\n\nDo polynomial division or factor.\n\nLet’s divide Q(x) by (x − 1/2).\n\nUse synthetic division with root 1/2:\n\nCoefficients: 32, −48, 18, −1\n\nBring down 32. Multiply by 1/2: 16. Add to −48 → −32  \nMultiply −32 by 1/2 = −16. Add to 18 → 2  \nMultiply 2 by 1/2 = 1. Add to −1 → 0. Good.\n\nSo quotient is 32x² − 32x + 2.\n\nSo Q(x) = (x − 1/2)(32x² − 32x + 2)\n\nSimplify quadratic: factor 2 → 2(16x² − 16x + 1)\n\nDiscriminant: 256 − 64 = 192 = 64×3 ⇒ sqrt = 8√3\n\nRoots: [16 ± 8√3]/32 = [2 ± √3]/4\n\nCompute numerically:\n\n√3 ≈ 1.732  \nSo [2 − 1.732]/4 = 0.267/4 ≈ 0.0668  \n[2 + 1.732]/4 = 3.732/4 ≈ 0.933\n\nSo roots at approx x ≈ 0.067, 0.5, 0.933 — all in [0,1]. Great.\n\nSo |Q(x)| is:\n\n- Negative on [0, 0.067) → |Q| = −Q  \n- Positive on (0.067, 0.5) → |Q| = Q  \n- Negative on (0.5, 0.933) → |Q| = −Q  \n- Positive on (0.933, 1] → |Q| = Q\n\nSo ∫₀¹ |Q| dx = ∫₀^{r₁} (−Q) + ∫_{r₁}^{1/2} Q + ∫_{1/2}^{r₃} (−Q) + ∫_{r₃}^1 Q\n\nBut integrating piecewise is tedious. However, note that Q is antisymmetric about x = 1/2? Let's test:\n\nQ(1−x) = 32(1−x)³ − 48(1−x)² + 18(1−x) − 1\n\nCompute:\n\n(1−x)³ = 1 − 3x + 3x² − x³  \n32×that = 32 − 96x + 96x² − 32x³  \n(1−x)² = 1 − 2x + x²  \n−48×that = −48 + 96x − 48x²  \n18(1−x) = 18 − 18x  \n−1 remains.\n\nSum all:\n\nConstants: 32 − 48 + 18 − 1 = 1  \nx terms: −96x + 96x − 18x = −18x  \nx² terms: 96x² − 48x² = 48x²  \nx³ terms: −32x³\n\nSo Q(1−x) = −32x³ + 48x² − 18x + 1 = −[32x³ − 48x² + 18x − 1] = −Q(x)\n\nYes! So Q is antisymmetric about x = 1/2: Q(1−x) = −Q(x). Therefore, |Q(1−x)| = |Q(x)|, so |Q| is symmetric about x = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, ∫₀¹ |Q(x)| dx = 2 ∫₀^{1/2} |Q(x)| dx\n\nOn [0,1/2], Q goes from −1 at 0 to 0 at r₁ ≈ 0.067, then to +1 at 0.25, then to 0 at 0.5.\n\nSo on [0, r₁]: Q < 0 ⇒ |Q| = −Q  \nOn [r₁, 0.5]: Q ≥ 0 ⇒ |Q| = Q\n\nSo ∫₀^{1/2} |Q| = ∫₀^{r₁} (−Q) + ∫_{r₁}^{1/2} Q\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nHowever — the problem does *not* ask for C, but for α = P(1) for the extremal P.\n\nWe found Q(1) = 1.\n\nBut is there another extremal with P(1) ≠ ±1?\n\nSuppose we consider P(x) = c(x − r)(x − a)(x − b), with r ∈ [0,1], and scale c so that max |P| = 1.\n\nTo maximize ∫|P|, intuitively you want P to be as close to ±1 as possible over as much of [0,1] as possible. The equioscillating polynomial does that optimally.\n\nMoreover, standard references (e.g., problems from Putnam, IMC) suggest that for this exact problem — cubic, root in [0,1], sup norm 1 — the extremal is indeed T₃(2x−1), and P(1) = 1.\n\nBut let’s test a simpler candidate: suppose P has a double root at 0 and another root at 1: P(x) = k x²(x−1). Then P(1) = 0. Max |P| on [0,1]? Let's see.\n\nP(x) = k x²(1−x) (if we flip sign to make positive inside). Actually x²(x−1) ≤ 0 on [0,1], max magnitude at critical point.\n\nLet f(x) = x²(1−x) on [0,1]. Derivative: 2x(1−x) − x² = 2x − 2x² − x² = 2x − 3x² = x(2−3x). Zero at x = 0, x = 2/3.\n\nf(2/3) = (4/9)(1/3) = 4/27 ≈ 0.148. So to make sup |P| = 1, need k = 1/(4/27) = 27/4 = 6.75.\n\nThen P(x) = (27/4) x²(1−x) — but this is nonnegative on [0,1], so |P| = P, and ∫₀¹ P = (27/4) ∫₀¹ x²(1−x) dx = (27/4) [∫x² − x³] = (27/4)[1/3 − 1/4] = (27/4)(1/12) = 27/48 = 9/16 = 0.5625.\n\nWhereas for Q(x), since |Q| ≤ 1, ∫|Q| ≤ 1, but likely > 0.5625. In fact, because Q hits ±1 at 4 points, average |Q| should be decent.\n\nWe can estimate ∫|Q| numerically. Since Q is antisymmetric, and |Q| symmetric, and Q(0.25)=1, Q(0.5)=0, Q(0.75)=−1, etc.\n\nApproximate using Simpson or just sample:\n\nAt x = 0: |Q| = 1  \nx = 0.067: 0  \nx = 0.25: 1  \nx = 0.5: 0  \nx = 0.75: 1  \nx = 0.933: 0  \nx = 1: 1\n\nSo |Q| looks like \"W\" shape: peaks at 0,0.25,0.75,1, zeros at ~0.067,0.5,0.933.\n\nRough trapezoidal estimate with points 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1:\n\n|Q(0)| = 1  \n|Q(0.25)| = 1  \n|Q(0.5)| = 0  \n|Q(0.75)| = 1  \n|Q(1)| = 1\n\nTrapezoid with h = 0.25: (0.25/2)[1 + 2(1 + 0 + 1) + 1] = (0.125)[1 + 2(2) + 1] = 0.125[1 + 4 + 1] = 0.125×6 = 0.75\n\nSo ∫ ≈ 0.75, larger than 0.5625. So Q is better.\n\nCan we do better than Q? Suppose we try P(x) = T₃(2x−1) scaled differently? No, it's already sup norm 1.\n\nThus, extremal is Q(x), and P(1) = Q(1) = 1.\n\nBut wait — the problem says \"normalized so that its maximum absolute value on [0,1] is 1\". Q achieves +1 and −1, so yes.\n\nHence α = 1.\n\nBut let’s double-check Q(1): earlier we computed Q(1) = 32 − 48 + 18 − 1 = (32+18) − (48+1) = 50 − 49 = 1. Yes.\n\nSo answer to Problem 1 is **1**.\n\nHold on — is there a possibility that the extremal has P(1) = −1? But then α would be −1. However, the problem says \"the extremal cubic polynomial\", singular, and often convention takes the one with positive leading coefficient. Since Q has leading coefficient 32 > 0, and P(1) = 1, that's natural.\n\nThus, answer_1 = 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\nWe are told:\n\n- n is even positive integer.\n- p is monic real polynomial of degree 2n:  \n  p(x) = x^{2n} + a_{2n−1}x^{2n−1} + … + a₀\n- p(1/k) = k² for all integers k with 1 ≤ |k| ≤ n.\n\nThat is, for k = ±1, ±2, ..., ±n, we have p(1/k) = k².\n\nWe are to find all other real numbers x such that p(1/x) = x².\n\nIn other words, define function q(x) = p(1/x) − x². We know q(k) = 0 for k = ±1, ±2, ..., ±n. So q has at least 2n roots: ±1,…,±n.\n\nWhat is the degree of q(x)?\n\np is degree 2n, monic, so p(1/x) = (1/x)^{2n} + a_{2n−1}(1/x)^{2n−1} + … + a₀  \nSo p(1/x) is a Laurent polynomial, but q(x) = p(1/x) − x².\n\nTo clear denominators, multiply by x^{2n}:\n\nLet’s define r(x) = x^{2n} p(1/x). Since p is monic degree 2n, r(x) is monic polynomial of degree 2n:  \nr(x) = x^{2n} [ (1/x)^{2n} + a_{2n−1}(1/x)^{2n−1} + … + a₀ ] = 1 + a_{2n−1} x + … + a₀ x^{2n}\n\nSo r(x) = a₀ x^{2n} + a₁ x^{2n−1} + … + a_{2n−1} x + 1 — i.e., reciprocal polynomial of p.\n\nGiven p(x) = ∑_{j=0}^{2n} c_j x^j, c_{2n}=1, then r(x) = ∑ c_j x^{2n−j} = x^{2n} p(1/x).\n\nSo r(x) is degree 2n, monic? No: leading term is c₀ x^{2n}, and c₀ = a₀ is unknown. But constant term of r is c_{2n} = 1.\n\nAnyway, back to q(x) = p(1/x) − x².\n\nWe know q(k) = 0 for k = ±1,…,±n ⇒ 2n distinct real roots.\n\nWhat is the nature of q(x)? It's not a polynomial, but a rational function: p(1/x) is rational with denominator x^{2n}, so q(x) = [r(x) − x^{2n+2}] / x^{2n}\n\nBecause:\n\np(1/x) = r(x) / x^{2n}, so q(x) = r(x)/x^{2n} − x² = [r(x) − x^{2n+2}] / x^{2n}\n\nSo numerator is s(x) = r(x) − x^{2n+2}\n\nNow, s(x) is a polynomial. Degree? r(x) is degree at most 2n (since p degree 2n), and x^{2n+2} is degree 2n+2, so s(x) has degree 2n+2, leading term −x^{2n+2}.\n\nWe know that for each k ∈ {±1,…,±n}, q(k) = 0 ⇒ s(k) = 0 (since denominator k^{2n} ≠ 0). So s(x) has roots at x = ±1, ±2, …, ±n — total 2n roots.\n\nThus, s(x) is divisible by ∏_{j=1}^n (x − j)(x + j) = ∏_{j=1}^n (x² − j²)\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nD(x) = ∏_{j=1}^n (x² − j²)\n\nThis is a polynomial of degree 2n, even, monic? Leading term: each (x² − j²) has leading term x², so product has leading term x^{2n}. Yes, monic degree 2n.\n\nSo s(x) = r(x) − x^{2n+2} is divisible by D(x), and deg s = 2n+2, deg D = 2n, so quotient is quadratic.\n\nThus,\n\ns(x) = D(x) ⋅ (A x² + B x + C)\n\nBut s(x) = r(x) − x^{2n+2}, and r(x) has degree ≤ 2n, so s(x) = −x^{2n+2} + lower-degree terms.\n\nThus, leading term of s is −x^{2n+2}, and leading term of D(x) is x^{2n}, so leading term of quadratic factor must be −x².\n\nSo A = −1.\n\nAlso, note that r(x) is reciprocal-like: if p(x) = ∑ c_j x^j, then r(x) = ∑ c_j x^{2n−j}, so r(x) is the \"reversed\" coefficients. In particular, r(x) is not necessarily even or odd, but let's see symmetry.\n\nGiven that p(1/k) = k² for k = ±1,…,±n, then for k and −k:\n\np(1/k) = k², p(−1/k) = (−k)² = k². So p(1/k) = p(−1/k) for k = 1,…,n.\n\nThus p is even on the set {±1, ±1/2, …, ±1/n}. Not enough to conclude p is even, but suggests perhaps p is even? Let's test.\n\nIf p were even, p(x) = p(−x), then p(1/k) = p(−1/k), which matches. And since the interpolation points are symmetric, and p is monic degree 2n, it's plausible p is even.\n\nAssume p is even: then only even powers appear: p(x) = x^{2n} + a_{2n−2} x^{2n−2} + … + a₀\n\nThen r(x) = x^{2n} p(1/x) = x^{2n} [ x^{-2n} + a_{2n−2} x^{-(2n−2)} + … + a₀ ] = 1 + a_{2n−2} x² + … + a₀ x^{2n}\n\nSo r(x) is also even.\n\nThen s(x) = r(x) − x^{2n+2} is even minus even = even? x^{2n+2} is even, r(x) even ⇒ s(x) even.\n\nAnd D(x) = ∏ (x² − j²) is even.\n\nSo quadratic factor must be even ⇒ B = 0, and A x² + C, with A = −1.\n\nSo s(x) = −D(x)(x² − C) ? Wait: A = −1, so s(x) = D(x)(−x² + Bx + C), but if even, B = 0, so s(x) = D(x)(−x² + C) = −D(x)(x² − C)\n\nThus,\n\nr(x) = s(x) + x^{2n+2} = x^{2n+2} − D(x)(x² − C)\n\nNow, r(x) has degree at most 2n, but RHS has x^{2n+2} − [x^{2n}](x² − C) = x^{2n+2} − x^{2n+2} + C x^{2n} = C x^{2n}\n\nSo r(x) = C x^{2n} + lower terms.\n\nBut r(x) is degree at most 2n, and leading coefficient is C.\n\nBut earlier, r(x) = x^{2n} p(1/x), and p is monic degree 2n ⇒ p(x) = x^{2n} + … ⇒ p(1/x) = x^{-2n} + … ⇒ r(x) = 1 + …, so constant term of r is 1, and leading coefficient of r is a₀ (coefficient of x^0 in p is a₀, so coefficient of x^{2n} in r is a₀).\n\nBut from above, r(x) = C x^{2n} + lower, so leading coefficient is C = a₀.\n\nBut also, constant term of r is 1.\n\nNow, D(x) = ∏_{j=1}^n (x² − j²) = ∏ (x−j)(x+j), so D(0) = ∏ (−j²) = (−1)^n ∏ j² = (−1)^n (n!)^2\n\nSince n is even, (−1)^n = 1, so D(0) = (n!)^2\n\nThen s(0) = r(0) − 0 = r(0) = 1\n\nBut also s(0) = D(0)(−0² + C) = D(0) ⋅ C = (n!)^2 C\n\nSo 1 = (n!)^2 C ⇒ C = 1/(n!)^2\n\nThus s(x) = −D(x)(x² − C) = −D(x)(x² − 1/(n!)^2)\n\nBut we may not need C.\n\nBack to original question: Find all real x such that p(1/x) = x².\n\nThat is, q(x) = 0 ⇔ s(x) = 0 (since denominator x^{2n} ≠ 0 for x ≠ 0, and x = 0 is not in domain because 1/x undefined).\n\nSo s(x) = 0.\n\nWe have s(x) = r(x) − x^{2n+2} = 0 ⇒ r(x) = x^{2n+2}\n\nBut from factorization, s(x) = −D(x)(x² − C), with C = 1/(n!)^2\n\nSo s(x) = 0 iff D(x) = 0 or x² = C\n\nD(x) = 0 when x = ±j for j = 1 to n — which are the given solutions.\n\nAdditional solutions: x² = C = 1/(n!)^2 ⇒ x = ± 1/(n!)\n\nAre these real? Yes.\n\nNow, check if x = 0 is allowed? p(1/x) undefined at x = 0, so exclude.\n\nSo total real solutions to p(1/x) = x² are:\n\n- x = ±1, ±2, ..., ±n (given)\n- x = ± 1/(n!)\n\nThus \"all other real numbers x\" beyond the given ones are x = ± 1/(n!)\n\nBut the problem says: \"Suppose that p(1/k) = k² for all integers k such that 1 ≤ |k| ≤ n. Find all other real numbers x for which p(1/x) = x².\"\n\nSo the given x's are integers k with |k| between 1 and n, i.e., x = ±1,…,±n.\n\nOther real x satisfying the equation are x = ± 1/(n!)\n\nHence answer is x = \\pm \\frac{1}{(n!)^2}? Wait no — we had x² = C = 1/(n!)^2, so x = ± 1/(n!)\n\nYes.\n\nConfirm dimensions: C = 1/(n!)^2, so x = ±1/(n!)\n\nThus the other real numbers are \\frac{1}{n!} and -\\frac{1}{n!}\n\nSo answer_2 = \"±1/(n!)\"\n\nBut the problem asks to \"find all other real numbers x\", so list them. Since n is given as even positive integer, answer should be in terms of n.\n\nSo final answer: x = \\frac{1}{n!} and x = -\\frac{1}{n!}\n\nIn the required JSON, we need to output the answer as a string? Or as a set? Looking at instructions: \"provide your final answers in the exact JSON format\", and \"for text answers, provide the exact text\".\n\nProbably write as \"±\\\\frac{1}{n!}\" but without LaTeX? Or as \"1/n!\" and \"-1/n!\"? But the problem says \"all other real numbers\", plural.\n\nBut in the JSON, answer_2 should be a string representing the answer.\n\nLooking at example: \"answer_2\": \"Monday\", so likely a string.\n\nCommon contest format: \"\\pm \\frac{1}{n!}\" but since no LaTeX, perhaps \"±1/(n!)\"\n\nYes.\n\nSo answer_2 = \"±1/(n!)\"\n\nBut let's double-check the algebra.\n\nWe had:\n\ns(x) = r(x) − x^{2n+2} = −D(x)(x² − C)\n\nSet s(x) = 0 ⇒ D(x) = 0 or x² = C\n\nD(x) = 0 ⇒ x = ±1,…,±n\n\nx² = C, and C = 1/(n!)^2? Let's recheck:\n\ns(0) = r(0) = constant term of r(x) = coefficient of x^0 in r(x) = coefficient of x^{2n} in p(x) = leading coefficient of p = 1? Wait no!\n\np(x) = x^{2n} + a_{2n−1}x^{2n−1} + … + a₁ x + a₀\n\nSo coefficient of x^0 is a₀.\n\nThen r(x) = x^{2n} p(1/x) = x^{2n} [ (1/x)^{2n} + a_{2n−1}(1/x)^{2n−1} + … + a₀ ] = 1 + a_{2n−1} x + a_{2n−2} x² + … + a₀ x^{2n}\n\nSo constant term of r is 1, and leading coefficient is a₀.\n\nThus r(0) = 1.\n\nD(0) = ∏_{j=1}^n (0 − j²) = ∏ (−j²) = (−1)^n ∏ j² = (−1)^n (n!)^2\n\nn even ⇒ D(0) = (n!)^2\n\ns(0) = r(0) − 0 = 1\n\ns(0) = −D(0)(0 − C) = −D(0)(−C) = D(0) C\n\nSo 1 = D(0) C = (n!)^2 C ⇒ C = 1/(n!)^2\n\nThus x² = 1/(n!)^2 ⇒ x = ± 1/(n!)\n\nYes.\n\nSo answer is ±1/(n!)\n\nThus answer_2 = \"±1/(n!)\"\n\nBut to match formatting, perhaps write as a set? But instructions say \"exact text\", and example is \"Monday\", so likely \"±1/(n!)\"\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers:\n\n- answer_1 = \"1\"\n- answer_2 = \"±1/(n!)\"\n\nNow write reasoning concisely.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The extremal cubic polynomial achieving the maximum integral under the sup-norm constraint and having a root in [0,1] is the shifted Chebyshev polynomial T_3(2x-1) = 32x^3 - 48x^2 + 18x - 1, which has sup norm 1 on [0,1] and roots in [0,1].
