We are to find the **minimum possible** $ |E| $, then compute $ d = \\operatorname{diam}(G) - 2 $.\n\nSo first step: Understand the extremal graph theory context.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Maximal triangle-free graphs\n\nA graph is *maximal triangle-free* if it is triangle-free, but adding any missing edge creates a triangle.\n\nSuch graphs are well-studied. A classic example is the **complete bipartite graph** $ K_{a,b} $, which is triangle-free (bipartite), and is maximal triangle-free **iff** it's *complete* bipartite and both parts are *independent sets*, and adding any edge within a part would create an odd cycle — but wait: adding an edge *within* a part doesn’t create a triangle necessarily — only edges *between* parts are allowed in bipartite; but $ K_{a,b} $ already has all possible edges between parts. So you cannot add any more *between-part* edges. To add an edge, you’d have to add one *inside* a part — say within the part of size $ a $. Does that create a triangle? Let's see: suppose we add edge $ u v $ inside left part. For a triangle, need a common neighbor $ w $ adjacent to both $ u $ and $ v $. Since $ u,v $ are in left part, their neighbors are all in right part. In $ K_{a,b} $, both $ u $ and $ v $ are adjacent to *all* vertices in right part. So any $ w $ in right part forms triangle $ u-v-w $. So yes! Adding *any* intra-part edge to $ K_{a,b} $ creates a triangle. So $ K_{a,b} $ is maximal triangle-free.\n\nAre there other maximal triangle-free graphs? Yes, but Turán’s theorem tells us the *maximum* number of edges in a triangle-free graph on $ n $ vertices is achieved by the complete bipartite graph with parts as equal as possible: $ K_{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor, \\lceil n/2 \\rceil} $. That’s the extremal (Turán) graph $ T_2(n) $.\n\nBut here we want **minimal** number of edges in a *maximal* triangle-free graph on $ n = 2019 $ vertices, with $ |E| > 2018 $. So minimal maximal triangle-free graphs.\n\nWhat’s the smallest possible size of a maximal triangle-free graph?\n\nThis is a known problem: minimal maximal triangle-free graphs. They are sometimes called *triangle-independent* or *minimally saturated* for triangles? Wait: “Maximal triangle-free” means no triangle, but adding any edge creates one → this is *triangle-saturated*: it's triangle-free and saturated with respect to triangles.\n\nYes! A graph $ G $ is **saturated** with respect to property $ \\mathcal{P} $ if $ G $ does not satisfy $ \\mathcal{P} $, but adding any edge makes it satisfy $ \\mathcal{P} $. So here, $ \\mathcal{P} = $ \"contains a triangle\", so $ G $ is *triangle-saturated*.\n\nSo we want the **minimum number of edges in a triangle-saturated graph on $ n = 2019 $ vertices**.\n\nThere is known result: the minimum size of a triangle-saturated graph on $ n $ vertices is $ n - 1 $, achieved by a **star** $ K_{1,n-1} $ — but is the star triangle-saturated?\n\n- Star $ K_{1,n-1} $: center $ c $, leaves $ v_1,\\dots,v_{n-1} $. No triangles (no edges among leaves). Add any missing edge: either between two leaves, say $ v_i v_j $. Then $ c, v_i, v_j $ form a triangle. So yes! Adding any leaf–leaf edge creates triangle. What about adding an edge from center to itself? No loops. All edges incident to center already exist. So only missing edges are among leaves. So yes, star is triangle-saturated.\n\nNumber of edges in star = $ n - 1 = 2018 $.\n\nBut problem says $ |E| > 2018 $. So star is excluded. So minimal $ |E| $ satisfying conditions is **at least 2019**.\n\nIs there a triangle-saturated graph on 2019 vertices with 2019 edges? That would be a unicyclic graph (tree + 1 edge → one cycle). But need to ensure it's triangle-saturated.\n\nHowever, note: star has diameter 2 (distance from any leaf to another is 2 via center). So $ \\operatorname{diam}(K_{1,n-1}) = 2 $, so $ d = \\operatorname{diam}(G) - 2 = 0 $.\n\nBut star has $ |E| = 2018 $, which is *not allowed*, since problem says $ |E| > 2018 $. So we need next smallest triangle-saturated graph.\n\nWhat’s next? Perhaps add one edge to star: make a triangle? No — can't, because then it wouldn't be triangle-free. So we need another triangle-saturated graph with more edges.\n\nStandard examples of triangle-saturated graphs:\n\n- Stars $ K_{1,n-1} $: $ n-1 $ edges, diameter 2.\n\n- Complete bipartite $ K_{2,n-2} $: edges = $ 2(n-2) = 2n - 4 $. For $ n = 2019 $, that's huge: ~4034. Too big; we want minimal.\n\nBut maybe there are others with $ n $ edges.\n\nConsider a **friendship graph**: $ F_k $, which is $ k $ triangles sharing a common vertex. But that contains triangles → invalid.\n\nWe need triangle-free.\n\nAnother idea: Take star $ K_{1,n-1} $, and subdivide an edge? That would increase vertices — not allowed.\n\nOr consider a graph composed of a star plus one edge among leaves — but that creates a triangle → violates triangle-free.\n\nSo can't just add edge to star.\n\nThus, to keep triangle-free and saturated, perhaps we need a different structure.\n\nKnown result: The minimum size of a triangle-saturated graph on $ n \\ge 5 $ vertices is $ n $, achieved by the **cycle $ C_5 $** for $ n = 5 $, but $ C_5 $ has 5 edges, is triangle-free, and adding any chord creates a triangle? Let's check: $ C_5 $: vertices 1-2-3-4-5-1. Missing edges are chords: e.g., 1-3: then triangle? 1-2-3-1? That's a triangle only if edge 1-3 and 2-3 and 1-2 exist — yes, 1-2 and 2-3 exist, so 1-3 creates triangle 1-2-3. Similarly, 1-4: path 1-5-4, so 1-4 creates triangle 1-5-4? Yes, if 1-5 and 5-4 exist (they do), so 1-4 creates triangle. So $ C_5 $ is triangle-saturated? Actually yes! And has $ n = 5 $ edges.\n\nBut $ C_n $ for $ n > 5 $: say $ C_6 $. Add chord 1-3: then triangle 1-2-3? Yes. But add chord 1-4: that's a diameter chord; does it create triangle? 1-4, with existing edges 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, etc. To get triangle, need a common neighbor: vertices adjacent to both 1 and 4. In $ C_6 $: neighbors of 1 are 2 and 6; neighbors of 4 are 3 and 5 — no common neighbor, so 1-4 does **not** create triangle. So $ C_6 $ is *not* saturated.\n\nSo only odd cycles? $ C_5 $ works, but $ C_7 $: add chord 1-3 → triangle 1-2-3. Add 1-4: neighbors of 1: 2,7; neighbors of 4: 3,5 — no intersection. So no triangle. So not saturated.\n\nThus $ C_5 $ is special.\n\nBack to general $ n $. Known theorem: Erdős, Hajnal, Moon (1964) — minimal size of triangle-saturated graph on $ n $ vertices is $ n $ for $ n \\ge 5 $, and extremal graphs are obtained by taking a star and adding a pendant edge? No.\n\nActually, let’s search known values: OEIS A006855? Or recall: the saturation number $ \\operatorname{sat}(n, K_3) $ is the minimum number of edges in a $ K_3 $-saturated graph on $ n $ vertices.\n\nIt is known that:\n- $ \\operatorname{sat}(n, K_3) = n - 1 $ for $ n \\le 4 $,\n- $ \\operatorname{sat}(n, K_3) = n $ for $ n \\ge 5 $.\n\nYes! Classic result: saturation number for triangles is $ \\operatorname{sat}(n, K_3) = n $ for all $ n \\ge 5 $, achieved for example by the graph consisting of a triangle-free connected graph with exactly one cycle — a unicyclic graph whose unique cycle is of length 5, and trees attached? But simpler: the **friendship graph is not allowed** (has triangles).\n\nWait, actually standard construction for $ \\operatorname{sat}(n,K_3) = n $ is the **union of a 5-cycle and $ n-5 $ isolated vertices?** No, must be connected? Not required — but usually considered simple graphs, no isolates? Problem doesn’t specify connectivity, but diameter is defined only for connected graphs. Since diameter appears later, $ G $ must be connected.\n\nSo we need a connected triangle-saturated graph on $ n = 2019 $ vertices with $ n $ edges → it must be **unicyclic**: connected, $ |E| = |V| $ ⇒ cyclomatic number 1 ⇒ exactly one cycle.\n\nAnd to be triangle-saturated, the unique cycle must be of length at least 5, and structured so that adding any chord or edge creates a triangle.\n\nBut earlier we saw $ C_5 $ works. Can we build a unicyclic graph with a $ C_5 $ and trees attached? Suppose we take $ C_5 $, and attach leaves to its vertices. Say attach a leaf to vertex 1: new vertex 6 adjacent only to 1. Now is it still saturated?\n\nMissing edges include: between 6 and 2: does that create triangle? 6-1-2 exists, so 6-2 creates triangle 6-1-2. Good. Between 6 and 3: neighbors of 6 is {1}, neighbors of 3 is {2,4}; no common neighbor ⇒ no triangle yet. So 6-3 does not create triangle ⇒ not saturated.\n\nSo attaching trees breaks saturation.\n\nHence, likely the only connected triangle-saturated graphs with $ n $ edges are rare.\n\nBut known result: $ \\operatorname{sat}(n,K_3) = n $ for $ n \\ge 5 $, and one construction is the **graph obtained from $ C_5 $ by repeatedly adding a new vertex and joining it to two adjacent vertices of the existing graph** — but that may create triangles.\n\nAlternative: the **book graph**? No.\n\nLet’s step back.\n\nThe problem says: “A graph $ G(V,E) $ is triangle-free, but adding any edges to the graph will form a triangle. It's given that $ |V|=2019 $, $ |E|>2018 $, find the minimum of $ |E| $.”\n\nSo minimal $ |E| $ is $ \\operatorname{sat}(2019, K_3) $, subject to $ > 2018 $. Since $ \\operatorname{sat}(n,K_3) = n-1 = 2018 $ is achievable (star), but excluded, next possible is $ 2019 $. Is $ \\operatorname{sat}(n,K_3) = n $ for $ n \\ge 5 $? Yes, and 2019 ≥ 5, so answer is 2019.\n\nThus minimal $ |E| = 2019 $.\n\nNow, what is the diameter of such a graph?\n\nWe need a triangle-saturated graph on 2019 vertices with 2019 edges — so unicyclic, one cycle, rest trees. To minimize diameter? Or what is diameter forced to be?\n\nBut the problem doesn’t ask for minimal or maximal diameter — it says “the graph satisfying the given conditions”, and then defines $ d = \\operatorname{diam}(G) - 2 $. So likely, for the extremal graph achieving minimal $ |E| > 2018 $, the diameter is fixed.\n\nWhat’s diameter of star? 2.\n\nIf we have a graph with 2019 edges, i.e., one more than star, while remaining triangle-free and saturated, what does it look like?\n\nOne way: take star $ K_{1,2018} $, which has center $ c $, leaves $ v_1,\\dots,v_{2018} $. It has 2018 edges. To add one edge without creating triangle, we cannot add any $ v_i v_j $, since that creates triangle $ c v_i v_j $. So impossible? Wait — but then how can there exist a triangle-free graph with 2019 edges on 2019 vertices that is saturated? Because adding any edge to star creates triangle, so star is already saturated — you cannot add edges and stay triangle-free. So any supergraph of star is not triangle-free. So the only triangle-free graphs containing star are star itself. So there is **no** triangle-free graph with 2019 edges that contains star as a subgraph.\n\nTherefore, a triangle-saturated graph with 2019 edges cannot contain a vertex of degree 2018. So it must be different.\n\nPerhaps it's a **complete bipartite graph $ K_{2,2017} $**? Edges = $ 2 \\times 2017 = 4034 $, too many.\n\nWhat about $ K_{3,2016} $? Even more.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the minimal triangle-saturated graphs with more than $ n-1 $ edges have larger diameter.\n\nBut let's recall: In any triangle-saturated graph, every pair of non-adjacent vertices must have at least one common neighbor — because if $ u,v $ are not adjacent, and have no common neighbor, then adding edge $ uv $ creates no triangle (since no $ w $ adjacent to both). So necessary and sufficient condition for triangle-saturated is:\n\n- $ G $ triangle-free,\n- Every pair of non-adjacent vertices has at least one common neighbor.\n\nThat’s key!\n\nSo $ G $ is triangle-free and **weakly closed**: every non-edge lies in at least one $ C_4 $ or \"V\" shape with common neighbor.\n\nSo for any non-adjacent $ u,v $, $ |N(u) \\cap N(v)| \\ge 1 $.\n\nNow, in such a graph, what is the diameter?\n\nIf every non-adjacent pair has a common neighbor, then distance between any two non-adjacent vertices is at most 2 (via common neighbor). If adjacent, distance 1. So diameter ≤ 2.\n\nCan diameter be 1? Only if complete graph, but complete graph on ≥3 vertices has triangles → invalid. So diameter is at least 2.\n\nThus, for any triangle-saturated graph, $ \\operatorname{diam}(G) = 2 $.\n\nBecause:\n- Not complete ⇒ some non-edge ⇒ those two vertices have a common neighbor ⇒ distance 2.\n- All distances are 1 or 2 ⇒ diameter = 2.\n\nYes! So for any triangle-saturated graph with at least one non-edge (i.e., not complete, which it can’t be), diameter is exactly 2.\n\nHence $ \\operatorname{diam}(G) = 2 $, so $ d = 2 - 2 = 0 $.\n\nThis holds for star (diam 2), and for any other triangle-saturated graph — since if $ u,v $ not adjacent, they have common neighbor, so distance 2; if adjacent, distance 1. So max distance is 2.\n\nThus $ d = 0 $.\n\nGreat! So $ d = 0 $.\n\nNow the functional equation becomes:\n\nFind all functions $ f: (0,\\infty) \\to (0,\\infty) $ such that for all $ x,y,z > 0 $ with $ xyz = 1 $,\n\n$$\nf\\left(x+\\frac{1}{y}\\right)+f\\left(y+\\frac{1}{z}\\right) + f\\left(z+\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 1.\n$$\n\nBecause $ d = 0 $, so $ d+1 = 1 $.\n\nSo domain is $ (0,\\infty) $, codomain $ (0,\\infty) $, and equation:\n\n$$\nf\\left(x+\\frac{1}{y}\\right)+f\\left(y+\\frac{1}{z}\\right) + f\\left(z+\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 1 \\quad \\forall x,y,z > 0,\\ xyz = 1.\n$$\n\nWe need to find all such functions.\n\nLet’s try constant function: suppose $ f(t) = c $ for all $ t > 0 $. Then LHS = $ 3c = 1 $ ⇒ $ c = \\frac{1}{3} $. And $ c > 0 $, so OK. So $ f(t) = \\frac{1}{3} $ is a solution.\n\nAre there others?\n\nTry to see if function must be constant.\n\nMake substitutions using $ xyz = 1 $.\n\nLet $ x = a $, $ y = b $, then $ z = \\frac{1}{ab} $.\n\nThen arguments become:\n\n- First term: $ x + \\frac{1}{y} = a + \\frac{1}{b} $\n- Second: $ y + \\frac{1}{z} = b + ab = b(1 + a) $\n- Third: $ z + \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{ab} + \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{1 + b}{ab} $\n\nNot obviously symmetric.\n\nTry symmetric choice: let $ x = y = z $. Since $ xyz = 1 $, then $ x^3 = 1 $ ⇒ $ x = 1 $. So $ x = y = z = 1 $.\n\nThen each argument is $ 1 + \\frac{1}{1} = 2 $, so equation becomes:\n\n$ f(2) + f(2) + f(2) = 1 $ ⇒ $ 3f(2) = 1 $ ⇒ $ f(2) = \\frac{1}{3} $.\n\nSo $ f $ must satisfy $ f(2) = \\frac{1}{3} $.\n\nNow try other points. Let $ x = t $, $ y = \\frac{1}{t} $, then $ z = \\frac{1}{x y} = \\frac{1}{t \\cdot \\frac{1}{t}} = 1 $.\n\nSo $ x = t $, $ y = t^{-1} $, $ z = 1 $, all > 0.\n\nThen:\n\n- $ x + \\frac{1}{y} = t + t = 2t $\n- $ y + \\frac{1}{z} = t^{-1} + 1 $\n- $ z + \\frac{1}{x} = 1 + t^{-1} $\n\nSo second and third arguments are equal: both $ 1 + \\frac{1}{t} $.\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\n$$\nf(2t) + 2 f\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{t}\\right) = 1 \\quad \\forall t > 0.\n$$\n\nLet $ u = t > 0 $, so:\n\n$$\nf(2u) = 1 - 2 f\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{u}\\right).\n$$\n\nSet $ v = 1 + \\frac{1}{u} $. Since $ u > 0 $, $ \\frac{1}{u} > 0 $, so $ v > 1 $. Also, $ u = \\frac{1}{v - 1} $, so $ 2u = \\frac{2}{v - 1} $. Thus:\n\n$$\nf\\left(\\frac{2}{v - 1}\\right) = 1 - 2 f(v) \\quad \\forall v > 1.\n$$\n\nSo for all $ v > 1 $,\n\n$$\nf\\left(\\frac{2}{v - 1}\\right) + 2 f(v) = 1. \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nNow, let $ w = \\frac{2}{v - 1} $. Then $ v = 1 + \\frac{2}{w} $, and $ w > 0 $ (since $ v > 1 $ ⇒ $ v-1 > 0 $ ⇒ $ w > 0 $). So for all $ w > 0 $,\n\n$$\nf(w) + 2 f\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{w}\\right) = 1. \\tag{2}\n$$\n\nNow apply (1) again to argument $ 1 + \\frac{2}{w} $, which is > 1, so:\n\nLet $ v' = 1 + \\frac{2}{w} > 1 $, then\n\n$$\nf\\left(\\frac{2}{v' - 1}\\right) = 1 - 2 f(v') = 1 - 2 f\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{w}\\right).\n$$\n\nBut $ v' - 1 = \\frac{2}{w} $, so $ \\frac{2}{v' - 1} = w $. So LHS is $ f(w) $, and RHS is $ 1 - 2 f\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{w}\\right) $, which matches (2): $ f(w) = 1 - 2 f\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{w}\\right) $, same as (2).\n\nSo consistent.\n\nNow, suppose $ f $ is constant $ \\frac{1}{3} $: satisfies (2) since $ \\frac{1}{3} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 1 $.\n\nAre there non-constant solutions?\n\nAssume $ f $ is of form $ f(t) = \\frac{1}{3} + g(t) $, where $ g $ is some function. Plug into original equation:\n\nLHS = $ \\sum \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} + g(\\cdot) \\right] = 1 + g(A) + g(B) + g(C) = 1 $, so need $ g(A) + g(B) + g(C) = 0 $ for all $ x,y,z > 0, xyz = 1 $, where $ A = x + 1/y $, etc.\n\nSo $ g $ must satisfy sum zero over those arguments.\n\nBut without more constraints, many $ g $ could work? However, domain and codomain are $ (0,\\infty) $, and $ f(t) > 0 $, so $ g(t) > -\\frac{1}{3} $.\n\nBut the problem asks to \"find all functions\", implying perhaps only constant.\n\nTry to see if $ f $ must be constant.\n\nFrom (2): $ f(w) = 1 - 2 f\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{w}\\right) $.\n\nApply again: replace $ w $ with $ 1 + \\frac{2}{w} $:\n\nLet $ w_1 = w $, $ w_2 = 1 + \\frac{2}{w_1} $, $ w_3 = 1 + \\frac{2}{w_2} $, etc.\n\nCompute iteration: suppose $ w_1 = 2 $, then $ w_2 = 1 + \\frac{2}{2} = 2 $, fixed point. So $ w = 2 $ is fixed: $ f(2) = \\frac{1}{3} $, as before.\n\nSuppose $ w = 1 $: then $ f(1) = 1 - 2 f(1 + 2/1) = 1 - 2 f(3) $.\n\nSimilarly, $ f(3) = 1 - 2 f(1 + 2/3) = 1 - 2 f(5/3) $.\n\n$ f(5/3) = 1 - 2 f(1 + 2/(5/3)) = 1 - 2 f(1 + 6/5) = 1 - 2 f(11/5) $, and so on — infinite chain.\n\nBut unless $ f $ is constant, hard to satisfy positivity.\n\nAssume $ f $ is continuous (though not given), then only constant solution. But problem doesn’t specify continuity.\n\nHowever, in competition problems like this, usually only constant function works, especially with symmetry and positivity constraints.\n\nMoreover, the functional equation is highly symmetric, and the constraint $ xyz = 1 $ suggests substituting $ x = a/b, y = b/c, z = c/a $, but may not help.\n\nTry another substitution: let $ x = \\frac{a}{b}, y = \\frac{b}{c}, z = \\frac{c}{a} $, then $ xyz = 1 $. Then:\n\n- $ x + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{c}{b} = \\frac{a + c}{b} $\n- $ y + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{b}{c} + \\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{a + b}{c} $\n- $ z + \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{c}{a} + \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{b + c}{a} $\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n$$\nf\\left(\\frac{a+c}{b}\\right) + f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{c}\\right) + f\\left(\\frac{b+c}{a}\\right) = 1 \\quad \\forall a,b,c > 0.\n$$\n\nStill symmetric.\n\nIf we set $ a = b = c $, get $ f(2) + f(2) + f(2) = 1 $, same.\n\nNow, suppose $ f $ is constant, works.\n\nTo check uniqueness, assume there is a non-constant solution. Then there exist $ p,q > 0 $ with $ f(p) \\neq f(q) $. But the functional equation forces many relations; likely contradiction with positivity.\n\nGiven the problem asks to \"find all functions\", and in such olympiad contexts with symmetric equations and positivity, the only solution is the constant function.\n\nThus $ f(t) = \\frac{1}{3} $ for all $ t > 0 $.\n\nSo the answer is the constant function $ \\frac{1}{3} $.\n\nBut the problem says \"Find all functions $ f:(d,\\infty) \\to (d,\\infty) $\" — with $ d = 0 $, so $ (0,\\infty) \\to (0,\\infty) $, and $ f(t) = \\frac{1}{3} $ maps into $ (0,\\infty) $, yes.\n\nSo final answer is $ \\frac{1}{3} $.\n\nBut wait — the problem says \"Find all functions\", but the answer format expects a single value in quotes. Looking back at instructions: \"put ONLY the answer value in the quotes\". And example shows \"42\" or \"Monday\". So likely they want the function's expression? But format is for a single value.\n\nRe-read the problem: \"Find all functions ... such that [equation].\"\n\nBut then it says \"provide your final answer in the exact JSON format\", with \"answer\": \"your final answer\".\n\nIn similar problems, if answer is a function, sometimes they want the expression, e.g., \"1/3\".\n\nGiven that the only function is constant $ \\frac{1}{3} $, and it's unique, the answer is $ \\frac{1}{3} $.\n\nSo answer is \"1/3\".\n\nBut let's confirm $ d = 0 $ is correct.\n\nEarlier: triangle-saturated graph must have diameter 2, because any two non-adjacent vertices have a common neighbor ⇒ distance 2, and adjacent distance 1, so diameter = 2. Yes.\n\nThus $ d = 0 $.\n\nEquation simplifies to sum equals 1, constant solution $ \\frac{1}{3} $.\n\nHence answer is $ \\frac{1}{3} $.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The graph G is triangle-saturated (triangle-free but adding any edge creates a triangle). For n = 2019 vertices, the minimal number of edges in such a graph is n - 1 = 2018 (achieved by the star graph), but the problem requires |E| > 2018, so the next possible minimal size is 2019. However, any triangle-saturated graph must have diameter 2, because non-adjacent vertices must share a common neighbor (otherwise adding the edge wouldn't create a triangle), ensuring distance at most 2, and since the graph isn't complete, diameter is exactly 2. Thus diam(G) = 2, so d = diam(G) - 2 = 0. Substituting d = 0 into the functional equation gives f(x + 1/y) + f(y + 1/z) + f(z + 1/x) = 1 for all x, y, z > 0 with xyz = 1. Testing the constant function f(t) = 1/3 satisfies the equation.
