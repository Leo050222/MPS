  "reasoning_content": "We are given a system of two linear congruences modulo $ m = n+1 $:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3a + 5b &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{m} \\\\\n4a + 2b &\\equiv 25 \\pmod{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe are told that $ n $ is the answer to the problem, but instead of solving for $ n $ directly, we define $ m = n+1 $, and then define $ \\ell = m - 95 $. So $ \\ell = (n+1) - 95 = n - 94 $. So once we find $ m $, we get $ \\ell $, and then use it as side $ AB $ in quadrilateral $ABCD$ with sides:\n\n- $ AB = \\ell $\n- $ BC = 3 $\n- $ CD = 5 $\n- $ DA = 4 $\n\nWe are to find the **maximum possible radius** of a circle inscribed in quadrilateral $ABCD$. That is, the **inradius**, assuming such a circle exists — i.e., the quadrilateral is **tangential**, meaning it has an incircle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand when a quadrilateral has an incircle\n\nA convex quadrilateral has an incircle (is tangential) **iff** the sums of lengths of opposite sides are equal:\n\n$$\nAB + CD = BC + DA\n$$\n\nSo for $ABCD$ to be tangential:\n\n$$\n\\ell + 5 = 3 + 4 = 7 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\ell = 2\n$$\n\nSo only if $ \\ell = 2 $ does a tangential quadrilateral exist with those side lengths. But the problem asks for the **maximum possible radius** of an inscribed circle in quadrilateral $ABCD$ with those side lengths. So perhaps $ABCD$ is not required to be tangential? Wait — a circle *inscribed* means tangent to all four sides — that's only possible if the quadrilateral is tangential. So the maximum possible inradius occurs when the quadrilateral is tangential and also has maximal area (since for a tangential quadrilateral, area $ K = r \\cdot s $, where $ s = \\frac{a+b+c+d}{2} $ is the semiperimeter, and $ r = K/s $). So to maximize $ r $, for fixed side lengths, we need to maximize area $ K $.\n\nBut for a tangential quadrilateral with fixed side lengths, the area is **maximized** when it's also **cyclic**, i.e., a **bicentric quadrilateral**, and in that case, there's a known formula (Brahmagupta’s formula for cyclic quadrilaterals, and Pitot for tangential). However, not all tangential quadrilaterals are cyclic, and not all cyclic quadrilaterals are tangential.\n\nBut crucially: For a quadrilateral to have an incircle, necessary and sufficient condition is Pitot: $ AB + CD = BC + DA $. So unless this holds, no incircle exists. So the *maximum possible* inradius is achieved only when this condition holds — otherwise, inradius is zero (no incircle). So the problem likely expects us to enforce Pitot, find $ \\ell $, then compute the inradius for that tangential quadrilateral.\n\nSo from Pitot:\n\n$$\nAB + CD = BC + DA \\Rightarrow \\ell + 5 = 3 + 4 = 7 \\Rightarrow \\ell = 2\n$$\n\nSo $ \\ell = 2 $. Then $ m = \\ell + 95 = 97 $, so $ n = m - 1 = 96 $. But wait — the problem says “Let $ n $ be the answer to this problem.” So is $ n = 96 $? But then it says “Instead of determining the value of $ n $, simply find $ \\ell = m - 95 $”, and then use $ \\ell $ as side length. So yes, we need $ \\ell = 2 $.\n\nBut hold on — is $ \\ell = 2 $ forced? Let's double-check.\n\nThe quadrilateral side lengths are $ AB = \\ell $, $ BC = 3 $, $ CD = 5 $, $ DA = 4 $. For a tangential quadrilateral, Pitot says sum of one pair of opposite sides equals sum of the other pair. There are two possibilities:\n\n- $ AB + CD = BC + DA $ → $ \\ell + 5 = 3 + 4 = 7 $ → $ \\ell = 2 $\n- $ AB + BC = CD + DA $ → $ \\ell + 3 = 5 + 4 = 9 $ → $ \\ell = 6 $\n- $ AB + DA = BC + CD $ → $ \\ell + 4 = 3 + 5 = 8 $ → $ \\ell = 4 $\n\nWait! Actually, the Pitot theorem states: A convex quadrilateral has an incircle **iff** the sums of lengths of **two pairs of opposite sides** are equal. So only one condition: $ AB + CD = BC + DA $, or equivalently $ AB + BC = CD + DA $, etc.? No — careful!\n\nStandard statement: In a tangential quadrilateral, the sums of lengths of **opposite sides** are equal. Opposite sides are $ AB $ and $ CD $, and $ BC $ and $ DA $. So only one condition: $ AB + CD = BC + DA $. So only $ \\ell + 5 = 3 + 4 = 7 \\Rightarrow \\ell = 2 $.\n\nOther pairings are not opposite. So yes, only $ \\ell = 2 $ works.\n\nThus $ \\ell = 2 $. So sides are $ 2, 3, 5, 4 $. Check triangle inequalities? Not directly relevant, but for existence of a convex quadrilateral with given sides, the sum of any three sides must exceed the fourth:\n\n- $ 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 > 5 $\n- $ 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 > 4 $\n- $ 2 + 4 + 5 = 11 > 3 $\n- $ 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 > 2 $\n\nSo OK.\n\nNow, for a tangential quadrilateral, area $ K = r \\cdot s $, where $ s = \\frac{a+b+c+d}{2} $ is semiperimeter.\n\nSo $ s = \\frac{2 + 3 + 5 + 4}{2} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7 $\n\nSo $ K = 7r \\Rightarrow r = K/7 $. So to maximize $ r $, maximize area $ K $.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible area of a tangential quadrilateral with given side lengths?\n\nIt is known that among all tangential quadrilaterals with given side lengths, the **cyclic** one has maximal area. And a quadrilateral that is both cyclic and tangential is called **bicentric**. Not all side-length combinations allow bicentric quadrilaterals, but if they do, that gives max area.\n\nThere is a formula for area of a bicentric quadrilateral? Or we can use Brahmagupta’s formula for cyclic quadrilaterals: $ K = \\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)} $, which applies to any cyclic quadrilateral.\n\nBut is the quadrilateral with sides $ 2,3,5,4 $ cyclic? For a quadrilateral to be cyclic, sum of opposite angles is 180°, but side-wise, there's no simple necessary/sufficient condition like Pitot. However, for given sides, a cyclic quadrilateral exists iff the sum of some three sides > fourth (already satisfied), and also the sides can be ordered so that the quadrilateral closes — but more concretely, Brahmagupta’s formula gives real area iff the expression under sqrt is non-negative.\n\nCompute:\n\n$ s = 7 $, so:\n\n- $ s - a = 7 - 2 = 5 $\n- $ s - b = 7 - 3 = 4 $\n- $ s - c = 7 - 5 = 2 $\n- $ s - d = 7 - 4 = 3 $\n\nSo product: $ 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 120 $, so $ K = \\sqrt{120} = 2\\sqrt{30} \\approx 10.954 $\n\nThen $ r = K / s = \\sqrt{120}/7 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{7} $\n\nBut is this achievable? That is, does there exist a quadrilateral with sides $ 2,3,5,4 $ that is both cyclic and tangential? For bicentric quadrilaterals, there is a necessary and sufficient condition: $ R \\ge 2r $, but more concretely, there's **Fuss' theorem**, but perhaps overkill.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to assume the quadrilateral is tangential (so $ \\ell = 2 $), and then the inradius is maximized when area is maximized, and for tangential quadrilaterals with fixed sides, the area is maximized when it's also cyclic, giving $ r = \\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)} / s $\n\nSo $ r = \\sqrt{120}/7 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{7} $. But is this the answer? It's irrational. Maybe simplifies? $ \\sqrt{120} = 2\\sqrt{30} $, yes.\n\nBut let's step back — maybe we misinterpreted the problem.\n\nLet’s re-read the first part carefully.\n\n> Let $ n $ be the answer to this problem. $ a $ and $ b $ are positive integers satisfying  \n> $ 3a + 5b \\equiv 19 \\pmod{n+1} $  \n> $ 4a + 2b \\equiv 25 \\pmod{n+1} $  \n> Find $ 2a + 6b $. Instead of determining the value of $ n $, simply find $ \\ell = m - 95 $, where $ m = n + 1 $ is the common modulus...\n\nWait! It says \"Find $ 2a + 6b $\" — but then immediately says \"Instead of determining the value of $ n $, simply find $ \\ell = m - 95 $...\" So perhaps $ 2a + 6b $ is congruent to something mod $ m $, and maybe $ 2a + 6b \\equiv ? \\pmod{m} $, and that value is related to $ \\ell $, or maybe $ 2a + 6b = \\ell $, or something.\n\nLet me solve the linear system modulo $ m $.\n\nWe have:\n\n(1) $ 3a + 5b \\equiv 19 \\pmod{m} $  \n(2) $ 4a + 2b \\equiv 25 \\pmod{m} $\n\nWe want $ 2a + 6b \\mod m $. Perhaps we can express $ 2a + 6b $ as a linear combination of the left-hand sides.\n\nLet’s try to find constants $ x, y $ such that:\n\n$ x(3a + 5b) + y(4a + 2b) = 2a + 6b $\n\nThen:\n\n$ (3x + 4y)a + (5x + 2y)b = 2a + 6b $\n\nSo solve:\n\n- $ 3x + 4y = 2 $\n- $ 5x + 2y = 6 $\n\nSolve:\n\nFrom first: $ 3x = 2 - 4y \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{2 - 4y}{3} $\n\nPlug into second:\n\n$ 5\\cdot \\frac{2 - 4y}{3} + 2y = 6 $\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n$ 5(2 - 4y) + 6y = 18 \\Rightarrow 10 - 20y + 6y = 18 \\Rightarrow 10 - 14y = 18 \\Rightarrow -14y = 8 \\Rightarrow y = -\\frac{4}{7} $\n\nNot integer. Try another approach: solve for $ a $ and $ b $ in terms of $ m $.\n\nUse linear algebra.\n\nWrite system:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 5 \\\\\n4 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na \\\\ b\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\equiv\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n19 \\\\ 25\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\pmod{m}\n$$\n\nDeterminant $ D = 3\\cdot 2 - 5\\cdot 4 = 6 - 20 = -14 $. So inverse exists modulo $ m $ iff $ \\gcd(14, m) = 1 $, i.e., $ m $ coprime to 14.\n\nAssuming that, solution is:\n\n$ a \\equiv D^{-1} (2\\cdot 19 - 5\\cdot 25) = D^{-1}(38 - 125) = D^{-1}(-87) \\pmod{m} $  \n$ b \\equiv D^{-1} (3\\cdot 25 - 4\\cdot 19) = D^{-1}(75 - 76) = D^{-1}(-1) \\pmod{m} $\n\nRecall for system $ \\begin{bmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} e \\\\ f \\end{bmatrix} $, solution is:\n\n$ a \\equiv (s e - q f)/D $, $ b \\equiv (p f - r e)/D $\n\nYes, since inverse matrix is $ \\frac{1}{D} \\begin{bmatrix} s & -q \\\\ -r & p \\end{bmatrix} $\n\nSo here $ p=3, q=5, r=4, s=2, e=19, f=25 $, $ D = -14 $\n\nSo:\n\n$ a \\equiv \\frac{2\\cdot 19 - 5\\cdot 25}{-14} = \\frac{38 - 125}{-14} = \\frac{-87}{-14} = \\frac{87}{14} \\pmod{m} $  \n$ b \\equiv \\frac{3\\cdot 25 - 4\\cdot 19}{-14} = \\frac{75 - 76}{-14} = \\frac{-1}{-14} = \\frac{1}{14} \\pmod{m} $\n\nSo $ a \\equiv \\frac{87}{14},\\ b \\equiv \\frac{1}{14} \\pmod{m} $\n\nThus $ 2a + 6b \\equiv 2\\cdot \\frac{87}{14} + 6\\cdot \\frac{1}{14} = \\frac{174 + 6}{14} = \\frac{180}{14} = \\frac{90}{7} \\pmod{m} $\n\nSo $ 2a + 6b \\equiv \\frac{90}{7} \\pmod{m} $. Since $ a,b $ are integers, $ \\frac{90}{7} $ must be integer mod $ m $, i.e., $ 7 $ must have inverse mod $ m $, and $ 90 \\cdot 7^{-1} \\mod m $ is integer.\n\nBut the problem says “Find $ 2a + 6b $”. Perhaps it wants the *value* of $ 2a + 6b $, not modulo $ m $. But $ a,b $ are positive integers satisfying those congruences; there are infinitely many solutions unless $ m $ is known.\n\nBut recall: $ n $ is defined as “the answer to this problem”, and $ \\ell = m - 95 $, and then quadrilateral is built. So likely, the system has a *unique* solution for $ 2a + 6b $ modulo $ m $, and perhaps $ 2a + 6b $ equals $ \\ell $, or relates.\n\nWait, the problem says: “Find $ 2a + 6b $. Instead of determining the value of $ n $, simply find $ \\ell = m - 95 $...” — this suggests that $ 2a + 6b = \\ell $, or $ 2a + 6b $ is congruent to $ \\ell $ mod $ m $, but since $ \\ell = m - 95 $, and $ m $ is modulus, $ \\ell \\equiv -95 \\pmod{m} $. Not helpful.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps $ 2a + 6b = 95 $, so $ \\ell = m - 95 $, and $ m $ is such that the system has solution, and $ 2a + 6b = 95 $ is the minimal positive value? Let's test small $ m $.\n\nWe need $ m $ such that the system has integer solutions $ a,b $. Since determinant is $ -14 $, for solution to exist for any RHS, need $ \\gcd(14, m) $ divides the \"determinants\" of augmented matrices, but since RHS are integers, as long as $ \\gcd(14,m) $ divides the numerators when solving.\n\nBut perhaps the problem intends that $ 2a + 6b $ is constant across all solutions, i.e., same modulo $ m $, and that value is $ \\ell $, and then $ \\ell = m - 95 $ implies $ m = \\ell + 95 $, so $ 2a + 6b \\equiv \\ell \\pmod{\\ell + 95} $. If $ 2a + 6b $ is positive and less than $ m $, then $ 2a + 6b = \\ell $.\n\nSo suppose $ 2a + 6b = \\ell $. Then since $ \\ell = m - 95 $, and $ m = n+1 $, and $ n = \\ell + 94 $, and $ n $ is the answer, but problem says \"Let $ n $ be the answer\", so final answer is $ n $, but then it says \"Instead of determining $ n $, find $ \\ell $\", and then use $ \\ell $ for quadrilateral. So ultimately, answer is the inradius, not $ n $.\n\nSo we need inradius of quadrilateral with sides $ \\ell, 3, 5, 4 $, maximized.\n\nEarlier we concluded $ \\ell = 2 $ for tangential. But is that the only possibility? Let's verify if other values of $ \\ell $ could allow an incircle if we reorder sides.\n\nQuadrilateral $ABCD$ has sides in order: $ AB = \\ell $, $ BC = 3 $, $ CD = 5 $, $ DA = 4 $. So opposite sides are $ AB $ & $ CD $, $ BC $ & $ DA $. So Pitot requires $ AB + CD = BC + DA $, i.e., $ \\ell + 5 = 7 $, so $ \\ell = 2 $. No choice.\n\nSo $ \\ell = 2 $.\n\nThus quadrilateral has sides $ 2,3,5,4 $, semiperimeter $ s = 7 $.\n\nFor a tangential quadrilateral, area $ K = r s $, so $ r = K/s $. Max $ K $ for given sides is when cyclic, giving $ K = \\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)} = \\sqrt{5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} = \\sqrt{120} = 2\\sqrt{30} $.\n\nSo $ r = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{7} $.\n\nBut is this the maximum possible inradius? Could there be a non-cyclic tangential quadrilateral with larger area? No — among all quadrilaterals with given sides, cyclic has maximal area (Brahmagupta). And among tangential ones, the cyclic one (if it exists) maximizes area.\n\nDoes a cyclic quadrilateral with sides $ 2,3,5,4 $ exist? The necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a cyclic quadrilateral with given side lengths is that the sum of any three sides exceeds the fourth, which holds, and also that the expression under Brahmagupta's formula is non-negative, which it is ($120 > 0$). So yes.\n\nMoreover, for it to be tangential, we need $ \\ell = 2 $, which we have, so it is bicentric? Not necessarily — being cyclic and having sides satisfying Pitot doesn't guarantee it's tangential; wait no, Pitot is necessary and sufficient for tangential, so if sides satisfy $ AB + CD = BC + DA $, then there exists a tangential quadrilateral with those sides. And separately, if Brahmagupta gives real area, there exists a cyclic one. But can both be satisfied simultaneously? That is, is there a bicentric quadrilateral with sides $ 2,3,5,4 $?\n\nThere is a theorem: A convex quadrilateral is bicentric iff $ ab + cd = ac + bd = ad + bc $ or something? No.\n\nActually, a necessary and sufficient condition for bicentric is complicated, but a known simpler condition: For a quadrilateral with sides $ a,b,c,d $ in order, it is bicentric iff $ a + c = b + d $ (tangential) and $ a c + b d = \\sqrt{(ab+cd)(ad+bc)} $ or something — too messy.\n\nPerhaps the problem assumes that with $ \\ell = 2 $, the quadrilateral can be arranged to be both cyclic and tangential, so max inradius is $ \\sqrt{120}/7 $.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects an integer answer. Let's compute numerical value: $ \\sqrt{120} \\approx 10.95445 $, divided by 7 ≈ 1.5649.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nAnother thought: \"Maximum possible radius of a circle inscribed in quadrilateral $ABCD$\" — maybe not requiring the circle to be tangent to all four sides, but just inscribed meaning inside and tangent to at least some sides? No, standard definition: inscribed circle = incircle = tangent to all four sides.\n\nPerhaps the quadrilateral doesn't have to be convex? But incircle usually assumes convex.\n\nOr perhaps we can vary the shape, not just cyclic/tangential, but for fixed sides, the inradius is maximized when the quadrilateral is \"as close to a rhombus as possible\", but with fixed sides, the tangential condition fixes $ \\ell $, and then area is maximized when cyclic.\n\nI think $ \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{7} $ is correct.\n\nBut let's check if $ \\ell $ could be something else. Suppose the system has solutions only for certain $ m $, and $ \\ell = m - 95 $ must be positive, and perhaps $ m $ divides some number.\n\nFrom earlier, $ a \\equiv \\frac{87}{14} \\pmod{m} $, $ b \\equiv \\frac{1}{14} \\pmod{m} $. For $ a,b $ to be integers, $ 14 $ must divide $ 87 $ and $ 1 $ modulo $ m $, i.e., $ 14 $ must have inverse mod $ m $, and $ 87 \\cdot 14^{-1} $ and $ 1 \\cdot 14^{-1} $ must be integers mod $ m $. So $ m $ must be coprime to 14, i.e., odd and not divisible by 7.\n\nAlso, $ 2a + 6b \\equiv \\frac{90}{7} \\pmod{m} $. For this to be integer, $ 7 $ must divide $ 90 $ mod $ m $, i.e., $ m $ divides $ 90 - 7k $ for some k, but more precisely, $ \\frac{90}{7} $ mod $ m $ means $ 90 \\cdot 7^{-1} \\mod m $, so as long as $ \\gcd(7,m)=1 $, it's defined.\n\nBut perhaps the smallest such $ m $ is when $ \\frac{90}{7} $ is integer, i.e., $ m $ divides $ 90/7 - integer $, but $ 90/7 $ is not integer. So $ 2a + 6b = \\frac{90}{7} + km $ for some integer $ k $. Since $ a,b $ are positive integers, perhaps minimal positive value of $ 2a + 6b $ is when $ k $ is chosen so that it's integer and minimal.\n\n$ \\frac{90}{7} = 12 + \\frac{6}{7} $, so to make it integer, need $ km \\equiv -6/7 \\pmod{1} $, i.e., $ 7km \\equiv -6 \\pmod{7} $, not helpful.\n\nPerhaps assume $ m = 97 $, then $ \\ell = 2 $, as before. 97 is prime, coprime to 14, good. Then $ 7^{-1} \\mod 97 $: find $ x $ such that $ 7x \\equiv 1 \\mod 97 $. $ 7*14 = 98 \\equiv 1 \\mod 97 $, so $ 7^{-1} \\equiv 14 $. Then $ 2a + 6b \\equiv 90 * 14 = 1260 \\mod 97 $. Compute $ 97*13 = 1261 $, so $ 1260 \\equiv -1 \\mod 97 $. So $ 2a + 6b \\equiv 96 \\mod 97 $. So possible value is 96, or 96 + 97k. Minimal positive is 96. Then $ \\ell = m - 95 = 97 - 95 = 2 $, matches.\n\nSo $ \\ell = 2 $.\n\nThus quadrilateral sides 2,3,5,4, semiperimeter 7, max area $ \\sqrt{120} = 2\\sqrt{30} $, so max inradius $ r = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{7} $.\n\nBut the problem asks for \"maximum possible radius\", and this is exact.\n\nSo answer should be $ \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{7} $. But let's see if it simplifies or if they want decimal — no, problem says \"exact value\".\n\nHowever, maybe I missed that for a tangential quadrilateral, area is also given by $ K = \\sqrt{(ab + cd)(ad + bc) - abcd \\cos^2 \\theta} $ or something, but no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum inradius occurs when the quadrilateral is degenerate? No, radius would be zero.\n\nOr when it's a kite? With sides 2,3,5,4, hard to form kite.\n\nI think $ \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{7} $ is correct.\n\nBut let's rationalize or write as $ \\frac{\\sqrt{120}}{7} $. Both fine.\n\nNow, JSON format requires answer in quotes, no LaTeX, so probably \"2*sqrt(30)/7\" or \"\\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{7}\", but instructions say \"no LaTeX formatting\", and \"for numerical answers, provide the exact value\". So likely they want simplified radical form as a string.\n\nBut looking at examples, they have \"42\" or \"Monday\", so probably expects a number, but this is irrational. Perhaps I made a mistake and the answer is rational.\n\nLet me double-check Brahmagupta: sides a=2, b=3, c=5, d=4, s=7.\n\n(s-a)=5, (s-b)=4, (s-c)=2, (s-d)=3, product 5*4*2*3 = 120, yes.\n\nArea = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nr = area / s = 2*sqrt(30)/7.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects the answer as a fraction: \"2\\sqrt{30}/7\", but instructions say \"no LaTeX\", so maybe \"2*sqrt(30)/7\".\n\nBut in many contests, they accept \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{7}, but here it says \"no LaTeX formatting\", so likely plain text.\n\nLooking back at rules: \"For numerical answers, provide the exact value\". This is an exact value, so \"2*sqrt(30)/7\" or \"2√30/7\". But √ is not ASCII, so probably \"2*sqrt(30)/7\".\n\nHowever, let me see if there's an alternative interpretation where r is integer.\n\nSuppose the quadrilateral is a square? No, sides different.\n\nOr perhaps it's a rhombus? No.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe \"maximum possible radius\" means over all possible $ \\ell $, not fixed $ \\ell $. But the problem defines $ \\ell = m - 95 $, and $ m = n+1 $, and $ n $ is answer, so $ \\ell $ is determined.\n\nWe found $ \\ell = 2 $, so fixed.\n\nThus answer is $ \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{7} $.\n\nSo final answer is \"2*sqrt(30)/7\"\n\nBut let's confirm with another approach.\n\nThere is a formula for inradius of a tangential quadrilateral: $ r = \\frac{K}{s} $, and $ K $ is maximized when cyclic, so yes.\n\nThus I think that's it.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The system of congruences modulo m = n+1 has determinant -14, and solving yields that for integer solutions a, b, m must be coprime to 14. The condition for a quadrilateral with sides AB = ℓ, BC = 3, CD = 5, DA = 4 to have an incircle is the Pitot theorem: AB + CD = BC + DA, so ℓ + 5 = 3 + 4 = 7, giving ℓ = 2. Thus the side lengths are 2, 3, 5, 4, with semiperimeter s = (2+3+5+4)/2 = 7.
