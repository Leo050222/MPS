  "reasoning_content": "We are given a complex problem that involves two main parts:\n\n1. A geometry problem about a tetrahedron $ABCD$, where we need to compute the distance from vertex $A$ to face $BCD$. That distance is expressed as $\\frac{a\\sqrt{b}}{c}$, with $a,b,c$ positive integers, $b$ square-free, and $\\gcd(a,c)=1$. Then define $d = \\gcd(a,c) + 0 = \\gcd(a,c) = 1$, since the condition says $\\gcd(a,c)=1$. So $d = 1$.\n\n2. Then, using that $d = 1$, find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x,y \\le 2020$ such that the quadratic form  \n$$\n(k+2)x^2 + 10xy + (k+2)y^2\n$$\nis equal to $p^k$ for some prime $p$ and integer $k \\ge d = 1$.\n\nBut wait — the expression depends on $k$, and $k$ is not fixed; it's part of the condition: there exists *some* integer $k \\ge d = 1$ and some prime $p$ such that the expression equals $p^k$.\n\nSo for each pair $(x,y)$, we ask: does there exist an integer $k \\ge 1$ and a prime $p$ such that  \n$$\n(k+2)(x^2 + y^2) + 10xy = p^k?\n$$\n\nLet’s denote:\n$$\nQ_k(x,y) = (k+2)(x^2 + y^2) + 10xy.\n$$\n\nWe want the number of $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+^2$, $1 \\le x,y \\le 2020$, such that for **some** $k \\ge 1$, $Q_k(x,y)$ is a prime power $p^k$.\n\nThis seems extremely open-ended unless there's simplification or constraint we’re missing.\n\nBut hold on — maybe the problem is misread? Let's re-express the original problem carefully.\n\n> The distance from vertex $A$ to face $BCD$ can be written as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are positive integers, $b$ is square-free, and $\\gcd(a, c)=1$. Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of computing the encoded value $100a + 10b + c$ from the parameters of the distance expression, simply find $d = \\gcd(a, c) + 0$, where $a, b, c$ are the positive integers such that the distance is $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$ with $b$ square-free and $\\gcd(a, c)=1$. Find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(x, y)$ with $x, y \\leq 2020$ such that $(k + 2) x^{2}+10 x y+(k + 2) y^{2}$ is the power of some prime $p^k$ for integer $k \\geq d$.\n\nSo yes — first compute $d = \\gcd(a,c) = 1$, because the problem explicitly states “$\\gcd(a,c)=1$” in the definition of the reduced fraction. So regardless of actual values of $a,c$, the condition enforces $\\gcd(a,c)=1$, so $d = 1$.\n\nThus $k \\ge 1$.\n\nNow consider the expression:\n\n$$\n(k+2)x^2 + 10xy + (k+2)y^2 = (k+2)(x^2 + y^2) + 10xy.\n$$\n\nLet’s try to understand when this can be a prime power $p^k$.\n\nNote: For fixed $(x,y)$, the left-hand side is a function of $k$: linear in $k$:\n\n$$\nQ_k = (k+2)(x^2 + y^2) + 10xy = k(x^2 + y^2) + 2(x^2 + y^2) + 10xy.\n$$\n\nSo $Q_k = k S + T$, where $S = x^2 + y^2 > 0$, $T = 2(x^2 + y^2) + 10xy = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 10xy$.\n\nSo $Q_k = kS + T$, and we want $Q_k = p^k$ for some prime $p$ and integer $k \\ge 1$.\n\nThat is, for given $x,y$, does there exist $k \\ge 1$ such that $p^k - kS = T$?\n\nThis is a Diophantine equation mixing exponential and linear terms — generally hard, but perhaps only small $k$ possible.\n\nTry small $k$:\n\n- $k = 1$: then $Q_1 = (1+2)(x^2 + y^2) + 10xy = 3(x^2 + y^2) + 10xy$. Want this to be $p^1 = p$, i.e., a prime.\n\nSo for $k=1$, condition becomes: $3x^2 + 10xy + 3y^2$ is prime.\n\n- $k = 2$: $Q_2 = 4(x^2 + y^2) + 10xy = 4x^2 + 10xy + 4y^2 = 2(2x^2 + 5xy + 2y^2)$. Could be $p^2$.\n\n- $k = 3$: $Q_3 = 5(x^2 + y^2) + 10xy = 5x^2 + 10xy + 5y^2 = 5(x+y)^2$. Ah! This is interesting.\n\nCheck:\n\n$$\nQ_3 = (3+2)(x^2 + y^2) + 10xy = 5x^2 + 5y^2 + 10xy = 5(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) = 5(x+y)^2.\n$$\n\nSo $Q_3 = 5(x+y)^2$.\n\nWe want $Q_3 = p^3$. So $5(x+y)^2 = p^3$.\n\nSince RHS is a perfect cube, LHS must be a perfect cube. So $5(x+y)^2 = p^3$.\n\nLet $x+y = m$. Then $5m^2 = p^3$. Since $p$ is prime, the prime factorization of LHS is $5 \\cdot m^2$. So $p$ must be 5 (only prime dividing LHS besides those in $m$). Try $p = 5$: then $5m^2 = 125 \\implies m^2 = 25 \\implies m = 5$. So $x+y = 5$, and $p=5$, $k=3$: works. Are there others? Suppose $p \\ne 5$, then $p^3$ divisible by $p$, but LHS has only prime factor 5 and those in $m$. So $p$ must be 5. So only possibility is $p = 5$, $m^2 = 5^{2} \\implies m = 5$. So only solutions for $k=3$ are $x+y = 5$, with $x,y \\ge 1$, so $(x,y) = (1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1)$ — 4 pairs.\n\nBut the problem asks for existence of *some* $k \\ge 1$, so if for a given $(x,y)$, any $k \\ge 1$ makes $Q_k$ a prime power $p^k$, count it.\n\nSo perhaps many pairs satisfy $k=1$: $3x^2 + 10xy + 3y^2$ is prime.\n\nBut $x,y$ up to 2020 → huge domain. Counting how many such pairs make that expression prime seems intractable unless expression factors or is always composite except trivial cases.\n\nLet’s examine the quadratic form:\n\n$$\n3x^2 + 10xy + 3y^2.\n$$\n\nCompute its discriminant: $10^2 - 4\\cdot3\\cdot3 = 100 - 36 = 64 = 8^2$, so it's factorable over integers.\n\nIndeed, try factoring:\n\nAssume $(ax + by)(cx + dy) = ac x^2 + (ad + bc) xy + bd y^2$.\n\nWe want $ac = 3$, $bd = 3$, $ad + bc = 10$.\n\nPossibilities: $a=3,c=1$ or $a=1,c=3$, same for $b,d$.\n\nTry $a=3,c=1$, $b=1,d=3$: then $ad + bc = 3\\cdot3 + 1\\cdot1 = 9 + 1 = 10$. Yes!\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n3x^2 + 10xy + 3y^2 = (3x + y)(x + 3y).\n$$\n\nCheck: $(3x + y)(x + 3y) = 3x\\cdot x + 3x\\cdot 3y + y\\cdot x + y\\cdot 3y = 3x^2 + 9xy + xy + 3y^2 = 3x^2 + 10xy + 3y^2$. Correct.\n\nSo for $k = 1$, $Q_1 = (3x + y)(x + 3y)$. For this to be prime, one factor must be 1, the other prime.\n\nSince $x,y \\ge 1$, both $3x+y \\ge 4$, $x+3y \\ge 4$, so neither can be 1. So $Q_1$ is always composite for $x,y \\ge 1$. So no solutions for $k = 1$.\n\nWhat about $k = 2$: $Q_2 = 4x^2 + 10xy + 4y^2 = 2(2x^2 + 5xy + 2y^2)$. Factor inner: $2x^2 + 5xy + 2y^2 = (2x + y)(x + 2y)$. Check: $2x\\cdot x = 2x^2$, $2x\\cdot 2y = 4xy$, $y\\cdot x = xy$, $y\\cdot 2y = 2y^2$: total $2x^2 + 5xy + 2y^2$. Yes.\n\nSo $Q_2 = 2(2x + y)(x + 2y)$. Since $x,y \\ge 1$, each factor $\\ge 3, 3$, so product $\\ge 2\\cdot3\\cdot3 = 18$, and has at least three prime factors (counting multiplicity), unless some factor is 1 — impossible. So $Q_2$ is composite for all $x,y \\ge 1$. So cannot be $p^2$ unless it's square of prime, but it's even, so $p=2$, then $Q_2 = 4$, but min is 18, so no.\n\n$k = 3$: we had $Q_3 = 5(x+y)^2$. Want $5(x+y)^2 = p^3$.\n\nAs before, only solution is $x+y = 5$, $p = 5$: $5 \\cdot 25 = 125 = 5^3$. So 4 pairs.\n\n$k = 4$: $Q_4 = 6(x^2 + y^2) + 10xy = 6x^2 + 10xy + 6y^2 = 2(3x^2 + 5xy + 3y^2)$. Discriminant of inner: $25 - 36 = -11 < 0$, so doesn’t factor, but still likely composite.\n\nBut maybe $k=0$? No, $k \\ge d = 1$.\n\nWait — what about $k = 5$: $Q_5 = 7x^2 + 10xy + 7y^2$. Not obviously factorable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better approach.\n\nLet’s revisit the problem statement again — could there be a misinterpretation?\n\nIt says: “$(k + 2) x^{2}+10 x y+(k + 2) y^{2}$ is the power of some prime $p^k$”\n\ni.e., the expression equals $p^k$, where the exponent is the same $k$ that appears in the coefficient.\n\nSo for each $k \\ge d = 1$, define $f_k(x,y) = (k+2)(x^2 + y^2) + 10xy$, and ask whether $f_k(x,y) = p^k$ for some prime $p$.\n\nSo for each pair $(x,y)$, if there exists at least one $k \\ge 1$ such that $f_k(x,y)$ is a perfect $k$-th power of a prime.\n\nWe already saw $k = 3$ gives $f_3(x,y) = 5(x+y)^2$. Set equal to $p^3$: $5(x+y)^2 = p^3$. As before, only solution in positive integers is $x+y = 5$, $p = 5$.\n\nAre there other $k$?\n\nTry $k = 5$: $f_5 = 7x^2 + 10xy + 7y^2$. Can this be $p^5$? Unlikely for small $x,y$, and $p^5$ grows fast.\n\nWhat about $k = 0$? Not allowed ($k \\ge 1$).\n\nWhat about large $k$? $f_k \\approx k(x^2 + y^2)$, while $p^k$ grows exponentially in $k$, so for fixed $(x,y)$, $f_k$ is linear in $k$, $p^k$ exponential, so at most one $k$ could satisfy equality, and only small $k$ plausible.\n\nTry $k = 2$: $f_2 = 4x^2 + 10xy + 4y^2 = 2(2x+y)(x+2y)$. For this to be $p^2$, need $2(2x+y)(x+2y) = p^2$. Since LHS even, $p = 2$, so $2(2x+y)(x+2y) = 4 \\implies (2x+y)(x+2y) = 2$. But $x,y \\ge 1$, so $2x+y \\ge 3$, impossible.\n\n$k = 4$: $f_4 = 6x^2 + 10xy + 6y^2 = 2(3x^2 + 5xy + 3y^2)$. Set equal to $p^4$. If $p = 2$, RHS = 16, so $2(3x^2 + 5xy + 3y^2) = 16 \\implies 3x^2 + 5xy + 3y^2 = 8$. Try $x = y = 1$: $3 + 5 + 3 = 11 > 8$. $x = 1, y = 1$ too big. No solutions.\n\n$k = 6$: $f_6 = 8x^2 + 10xy + 8y^2 = 2(4x^2 + 5xy + 4y^2)$. Set to $p^6$. $p = 2$ gives $64$, so $2(\\cdots) = 64 \\implies \\cdots = 32$. Try $x = y = 2$: $4*4 + 5*4 + 4*4 = 16 + 20 + 16 = 52 > 32$. $x = 1, y = 2$: $4 + 10 + 16 = 30$, close. $x = 1, y = 2$: $4(1) + 5(2) + 4(4) = 4 + 10 + 16 = 30$. Not 32. $x = 2, y = 1$: same. No.\n\nSo only viable $k$ is $k = 3$, giving 4 pairs.\n\nBut wait — what about $x = y$? Let’s test symmetry.\n\nIf $x = y$, then $f_k = (k+2)(2x^2) + 10x^2 = (2k + 4 + 10)x^2 = (2k + 14)x^2 = 2(k + 7)x^2$.\n\nSet equal to $p^k$. So $2(k+7)x^2 = p^k$.\n\nIf $x = 1$, then $2(k+7) = p^k$.\n\nTry $k = 1$: $2(8) = 16 = 2^4$, not $p^1$.\n\n$k = 2$: $2(9) = 18$, not square.\n\n$k = 3$: $2(10) = 20$, not cube.\n\n$k = 4$: $2(11) = 22$.\n\nNo.\n\nBut earlier we have 4 solutions from $k = 3$, $x+y = 5$: $(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1)$. All with $x,y \\le 2020$, so valid.\n\nAre there more for other $k$?\n\nConsider $k = 5$: $f_5 = 7x^2 + 10xy + 7y^2 = p^5$.\n\nMinimum when $x = y = 1$: $7 + 10 + 7 = 24$, while $2^5 = 32$, $3^5 = 243$. So $24 < 32$, try $x = 1, y = 1$: 24 ≠ 32. $x = 1, y = 2$: $7 + 20 + 28 = 55$. Not 32 or 243. Unlikely.\n\nWhat about $k = 0$? Not allowed.\n\nPerhaps $k = 7$: $f_7 = 9x^2 + 10xy + 9y^2$. At $x = y = 1$: $9 + 10 + 9 = 28$, $2^7 = 128$.\n\nNo.\n\nSo only $k = 3$ gives solutions.\n\nBut wait — what if $x = 0$ or $y = 0$? Problem says positive integers, so $x,y \\ge 1$.\n\nThus only 4 pairs.\n\nBut the problem asks for number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x,y \\le 2020$. So answer is 4?\n\nBut let's double-check if there are other $k$.\n\nConsider $k = 2m$ even, or something.\n\nAnother idea: suppose $x = y$. Then $f_k = (k+2)(2x^2) + 10x^2 = (2k + 14)x^2 = 2(k + 7)x^2$.\n\nFor this to be $p^k$, need $x^2$ to supply factors. Suppose $x = p^a$, then $2(k+7)p^{2a} = p^k \\implies k = 2a$ and $2(k+7) = p^{k - 2a} = p^0 = 1$, impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps $x = 5, y = 0$, but y must be positive.\n\nThus only the 4 pairs.\n\nBut wait — when $x+y = 5$, $x,y$ positive integers ≤ 2020: yes, all four are within bound.\n\nSo answer is 4.\n\nBut the problem might expect more. Let's see if $k = 3$ allows other $x+y$ if $p$ different.\n\nWe had $5(x+y)^2 = p^3$. Prime factorization: LHS has prime factors of 5 and those of $(x+y)$. So $p$ must be 5, and $x+y$ must be power of 5. Let $x+y = 5^m$. Then $5 \\cdot 5^{2m} = 5^{2m+1} = p^3 = 5^3$, so $2m + 1 = 3 \\implies m = 1$. So only $x+y = 5$.\n\nThus only 4 pairs.\n\nHence answer is 4.\n\nBut the problem says \"Find the number of ordered pairs...\", so answer is 4.\n\nHowever, let's confirm the geometry part quickly to ensure $d = 1$ is correct.\n\nTetrahedron $ABCD$ with edges:\n\n- $AB = 6$\n- $BD = 6\\sqrt{2}$\n- $BC = 10$\n- $AC = 8$\n- $CD = 10$\n- $AD = 6$\n\nWe need distance from $A$ to plane $BCD$.\n\nVolume $V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{area of } \\triangle BCD \\times h$, where $h$ is distance from $A$ to plane $BCD$.\n\nSo $h = \\frac{3V}{\\text{Area}_{BCD}}$.\n\nCompute volume using Cayley-Menger determinant.\n\nFor tetrahedron with vertices $A,B,C,D$, squared distances:\n\nLet’s label points: $A,B,C,D$.\n\nEdges:\n\n- $AB^2 = 36$\n- $AC^2 = 64$\n- $AD^2 = 36$\n- $BC^2 = 100$\n- $BD^2 = 72$\n- $CD^2 = 100$\n\nCayley-Menger determinant:\n\n$$\n288 V^2 = \n\\begin{vmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & AB^2 & AC^2 & AD^2 \\\\\n1 & AB^2 & 0 & BC^2 & BD^2 \\\\\n1 & AC^2 & BC^2 & 0 & CD^2 \\\\\n1 & AD^2 & BD^2 & CD^2 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}\n$$\n\nPlug in:\n\nRow 0: $0,1,1,1,1$\n\nRow 1: $1,0,36,64,36$\n\nRow 2: $1,36,0,100,72$\n\nRow 3: $1,64,100,0,100$\n\nRow 4: $1,36,72,100,0$\n\nCompute determinant.\n\nThis is tedious, but perhaps notice symmetries: $AB = AD = 6$, $BC = CD = 10$, so triangle $BCD$ is isosceles with $BC = CD = 10$, $BD = 6\\sqrt{2} \\approx 8.485$.\n\nCompute area of $\\triangle BCD$ using Heron's formula.\n\nSides: $a = BC = 10$, $b = CD = 10$, $c = BD = 6\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSemi-perimeter $s = \\frac{10 + 10 + 6\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 10 + 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nArea $= \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{(10 + 3\\sqrt{2})(3\\sqrt{2})(3\\sqrt{2})(10 + 3\\sqrt{2} - 6\\sqrt{2})} = \\sqrt{(10 + 3\\sqrt{2})(3\\sqrt{2})^2(10 - 3\\sqrt{2})} = \\sqrt{[(10 + 3\\sqrt{2})(10 - 3\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot 18} = \\sqrt{(100 - 18) \\cdot 18} = \\sqrt{82 \\cdot 18} = \\sqrt{1476}$.\n\nSimplify: $1476 = 4 \\cdot 369 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 123 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 41 = 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 41 = 36 \\cdot 41$. So $\\sqrt{1476} = 6\\sqrt{41}$.\n\nSo area of $\\triangle BCD = 6\\sqrt{41}$.\n\nNow volume: use scalar triple product. Place $B$ at origin, $C$ on x-axis, $D$ in xy-plane.\n\nLet $B = (0,0,0)$, $C = (10,0,0)$ since $BC = 10$.\n\nLet $D = (x,y,0)$ such that $BD = 6\\sqrt{2}$, $CD = 10$.\n\nThen $x^2 + y^2 = (6\\sqrt{2})^2 = 72$.\n\n$(x-10)^2 + y^2 = 100$.\n\nSubtract: $(x-10)^2 - x^2 = 100 - 72 = 28 \\implies x^2 -20x +100 - x^2 = 28 \\implies -20x = -72 \\implies x = 3.6 = \\frac{18}{5}$.\n\nThen $y^2 = 72 - x^2 = 72 - \\left(\\frac{324}{25}\\right) = \\frac{1800 - 324}{25} = \\frac{1476}{25} = \\frac{36 \\cdot 41}{25}$, so $y = \\frac{6\\sqrt{41}}{5}$.\n\nSo $D = \\left(\\frac{18}{5}, \\frac{6\\sqrt{41}}{5}, 0\\right)$.\n\nNow $A = (p,q,r)$, with distances:\n\n- $AB = 6$: $p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 36$\n- $AC = 8$: $(p-10)^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 64$\n- $AD = 6$: $\\left(p - \\frac{18}{5}\\right)^2 + \\left(q - \\frac{6\\sqrt{41}}{5}\\right)^2 + r^2 = 36$\n\nSubtract first from second: $(p-10)^2 - p^2 = 64 - 36 = 28 \\implies p^2 -20p +100 - p^2 = 28 \\implies -20p = -72 \\implies p = \\frac{18}{5}$.\n\nSame x-coordinate as D.\n\nNow from first: $p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 36 \\implies \\left(\\frac{18}{5}\\right)^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 36 \\implies \\frac{324}{25} + q^2 + r^2 = \\frac{900}{25} \\implies q^2 + r^2 = \\frac{576}{25}$.\n\nThird equation: $\\left(p - \\frac{18}{5}\\right)^2 + \\left(q - \\frac{6\\sqrt{41}}{5}\\right)^2 + r^2 = 36$. But $p = \\frac{18}{5}$, so first term 0. So $\\left(q - \\frac{6\\sqrt{41}}{5}\\right)^2 + r^2 = 36$.\n\nExpand: $q^2 - \\frac{12q\\sqrt{41}}{5} + \\frac{36 \\cdot 41}{25} + r^2 = 36$.\n\nBut $q^2 + r^2 = \\frac{576}{25}$, and $\\frac{36 \\cdot 41}{25} = \\frac{1476}{25}$.\n\nSo $\\frac{576}{25} - \\frac{12q\\sqrt{41}}{5} + \\frac{1476}{25} = 36 = \\frac{900}{25}$.\n\nSo $\\frac{576 + 1476}{25} - \\frac{12q\\sqrt{41}}{5} = \\frac{900}{25} \\implies \\frac{2052}{25} - \\frac{900}{25} = \\frac{12q\\sqrt{41}}{5} \\implies \\frac{1152}{25} = \\frac{12q\\sqrt{41}}{5}$.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5: $\\frac{1152}{5} = 12q\\sqrt{41} \\implies q = \\frac{1152}{5 \\cdot 12 \\sqrt{41}} = \\frac{96}{5 \\sqrt{41}} = \\frac{96 \\sqrt{41}}{205}$.\n\nThen $q^2 = \\frac{9216 \\cdot 41}{42025} = \\frac{377856}{42025}$. And $q^2 + r^2 = \\frac{576}{25} = \\frac{576 \\cdot 1681}{42025} = \\frac{968256}{42025}$. So $r^2 = \\frac{968256 - 377856}{42025} = \\frac{590400}{42025} = \\frac{590400 \\div 25}{42025 \\div 25} = \\frac{23616}{1681}$. Note $1681 = 41^2$, and $23616 = ?$ $41^2 = 1681$, $23616 / 1681 = 14.04...$ Wait, compute: $1681 \\times 14 = 23534$, remainder 82, not square.\n\nBut we only need $|r|$, the distance from $A$ to plane $BCD$, which is $|r|$ since plane $BCD$ is $z = 0$.\n\nSo $h = |r| = \\sqrt{r^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{590400}{42025}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{590400}}{205}$.\n\nSimplify $\\sqrt{590400}$. Factor: $590400 = 5904 \\times 100 = 16 \\times 369 \\times 100 = 16 \\times 9 \\times 41 \\times 100 = 144 \\times 41 \\times 100 = 14400 \\times 41$. So $\\sqrt{590400} = \\sqrt{14400 \\times 41} = 120 \\sqrt{41}$.\n\nThus $h = \\frac{120 \\sqrt{41}}{205} = \\frac{24 \\sqrt{41}}{41}$.\n\nSo $a = 24$, $b = 41$, $c = 41$, $\\gcd(24,41) = 1$, yes. So $d = \\gcd(a,c) = 1$.\n\nThus confirmed.\n\nSo back to counting: only 4 pairs.\n\nAnswer is 4.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The distance from A to face BCD is computed as 24√41 / 41, so a=24, b=41, c=41, and gcd(a,c)=1, thus d=1. For k≥1, the expression (k+2)x²+10xy+(k+2)y² must equal p^k for some prime p. Factoring shows for k=1 it's (3x+y)(x+3y), composite for x,y≥1. For k=2 it's 2(2x+y)(x+2y), also composite. For k=3 it's 5(x+y)², set equal to p³ gives only solution x+y=5, yielding ordered pairs (1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1). Higher k yield no solutions within bounds. Thus there are 4 ordered pairs.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4\"\n}",
