  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-part problem. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 1: Compute $ T(\\text{favorable}) $**\n\n> The game of Penta is played with teams of five players each, and there are five roles the players can play. Each of the five players chooses two of five roles they wish to play. If each player chooses their roles randomly, what is the probability that each role will have exactly two players? Instead of computing the probability that every role is selected by precisely two players, simply find $ T(\\text{favorable}) $, the total number of favorable outcomes where each role receives exactly two choices.\n\nSo:\n\n- There are **5 players**, each selects **2 roles** out of **5 roles**, i.e., each player chooses a 2-element subset of $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\n- So total number of *choices* made = $5 \\times 2 = 10$ role selections (with repetition allowed across players).\n- We want the number of ways the 5 players can each choose a 2-element subset such that **each role appears in exactly two of the chosen subsets**, i.e., total count of times role $i$ appears across all 5 players’ choices is exactly 2, for each $i = 1$ to $5$.\n\nSo we need to count the number of 5-tuples $(S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5)$, where each $S_j \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, $|S_j| = 2$, and for each role $r \\in \\{1,\\dots,5\\}$, the number of $j$ such that $r \\in S_j$ is exactly 2.\n\nThis is equivalent to constructing a **5×5 incidence matrix** $A = [a_{ij}]$, where rows = players (5), columns = roles (5), and $a_{ij} = 1$ if player $i$ chooses role $j$, else 0.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- Each row has exactly two 1s (since each player picks 2 roles).\n- Each column has exactly two 1s (since each role is picked by exactly two players).\n\nSo this is counting the number of **5×5 (0,1)-matrices** with **row sums = 2**, **column sums = 2**.\n\nThat is, the number of **5×5 binary matrices with all row and column sums equal to 2**.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorics / enumeration problem — counting **regular bipartite graphs**: bipartite graph with left side = players (5 vertices), right side = roles (5 vertices), each vertex has degree 2. So it's the number of **2-regular bipartite graphs** on $K_{5,5}$, i.e., number of 2-factors in $K_{5,5}$.\n\nEquivalently: number of 2-regular bipartite multigraphs? No, simple — no multiple edges (a player can’t pick same role twice — but since they pick *two distinct roles*, and roles are just labels, no repeated role per player, so no multiple edges). So it's simple bipartite 2-regular graphs — i.e., disjoint unions of even cycles covering all vertices.\n\nSince both sides have size 5, and each vertex degree 2, total edges = $5 \\times 2 = 10$. In a bipartite graph with both parts size 5, a 2-regular graph is a 2-factor — union of even-length cycles covering all 10 vertices.\n\nBut wait: total vertices = 10 (5+5), each degree 2 → graph is a disjoint union of cycles, all even length (bipartite), covering all vertices.\n\nSo possible cycle type decompositions of 10 vertices into even cycles: partitions of 10 into even parts ≥ 4 (since smallest even cycle in bipartite graph is 4-cycle):\n\n- One 10-cycle\n- One 6-cycle + one 4-cycle\n- Two 4-cycles + one 2-cycle? No, 2-cycle not allowed in simple bipartite graph (would mean two parallel edges between same pair — not allowed; also a 2-cycle would require an edge from player to role and back — but it's bipartite, no loops or 2-cycles). So minimum cycle length is 4.\n\nSo partitions of 10 into even integers ≥4:\n\n- 10  \n- 6 + 4  \n- 4 + 4 + 2 → invalid (2 not allowed)  \n- 4 + 6 → same as above  \n- 4 + 4 + 4 → sum = 12 > 10 → no  \nSo only:  \n- One 10-cycle  \n- One 6-cycle and one 4-cycle  \n\nAlso 4 + 4 + 2 invalid; 4 + 4 + 4 too big; 2+2+2+2+2 invalid. So only two types.\n\nBut perhaps easier: count number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums 2.\n\nThis is a known enumeration: number of $n \\times n$ (0,1)-matrices with all row and column sums equal to $k$ is denoted $A(n,k)$. Here $n = 5$, $k = 2$.\n\nWe can compute $A(5,2)$.\n\nThere is known data: OEIS A001499: number of $n \\times n$ (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums equal to $k$.\n\nLet’s recall or compute $A(5,2)$.\n\nWe can compute via formula or reasoning.\n\nOne way: This is same as number of 2-regular bipartite graphs on two parts of size 5 = number of ways to place 10 ones in a 5×5 grid with two per row/column.\n\nWe can compute using inclusion-exclusion or known values.\n\nI recall:\n\n- $A(1,1) = 1$  \n- $A(2,1) = 2$  \n- $A(2,2) = 1$ (all ones)  \n- $A(3,1) = 6$  \n- $A(3,2) = 6$ (complement of permutation matrices)  \n- $A(4,2) = 90$ (I think)  \n- $A(5,2) = ?$\n\nLet me try to compute $A(5,2)$.\n\nAlternative approach: It's the number of ways to choose 2 positions in each row, such that each column ends up with exactly 2 ones.\n\nThis is equivalent to number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with row sums 2, column sums 2.\n\nWe can model as: number of 2-factors in $K_{5,5}$. A 2-factor in $K_{n,n}$ is a spanning 2-regular subgraph = disjoint union of even cycles covering all vertices.\n\nNumber of 2-factors in $K_{n,n}$ is known: see OEIS A001499 or literature.\n\nLet me search my memory or derive.\n\nStandard formula: Number of $n \\times n$ (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums $k$ is:\n\n$$\nA(n,k) = \\sum_{\\sigma_1,\\dots,\\sigma_k \\in S_n} \\prod_{i=1}^n [ \\text{number of } \\sigma_j \\text{ mapping } i \\text{ somewhere} ]\n$$\n\nToo messy.\n\nBetter: Use known values.\n\nI recall that $A(5,2) = 225$? Let's test small cases.\n\nFor $n = 3, k = 2$: each row has two 1s → each row omits one column. So choosing for each row which column to omit. To have each column omitted exactly once (since column sum = 2 ⇒ appears in 2 rows ⇒ omitted in 1 row), so it's number of permutations: assign to each row a unique column to omit → $3! = 6$. Yes, matches.\n\nFor $n = 4, k = 2$: each row omits 2 columns. Column sum = 2 ⇒ each column appears in 2 rows ⇒ omitted in 2 rows. So we need a 4×4 (0,1)-matrix with row sums 2, column sums 2. Equivalently, its complement has row sums 2, column sums 2 as well (since 4−2 = 2). So it's same as $A(4,2)$. Known value is 90. (Yes, OEIS A001499: row n=4, k=2 is 90.)\n\nNow for $n = 5, k = 2$: OEIS A001499 says:\n\n- n=1: 1  \n- n=2: k=1→2, k=2→1  \n- n=3: k=1→6, k=2→6  \n- n=4: k=1→24, k=2→90, k=3→90, k=4→1  \n- n=5: k=1→120, k=2→2025? Wait let me verify.\n\nActually, I can compute using formula:\n\nThe number is:\n\n$$\nA(n,k) = \\frac{(nk)!}{(k!)^{2n}} \\times \\text{coefficient of } x_1^k \\cdots x_n^k y_1^k \\cdots y_n^k \\text{ in } \\prod_{i,j} (1 + x_i y_j)\n$$\n\nToo heavy.\n\nAlternative: use Bregman-Minc inequality? No.\n\nLet me instead think combinatorially.\n\nWe need to assign to each of 5 players a 2-element subset of {1,2,3,4,5}, such that each element appears in exactly two subsets.\n\nSo it's a collection of 5 distinct (but subsets can repeat? Wait: do players choose independently — can two players choose the same pair of roles? The problem says “each player chooses two of five roles they wish to play” — doesn’t say choices must be distinct. So repetitions allowed. So multisets of 5 subsets, each of size 2, such that each element appears in total twice.\n\nSo it's a multiset of 5 edges (since a 2-subset = an edge) on vertex set [5], such that each vertex has degree 2.\n\nSo it's a 2-regular multigraph on 5 labeled vertices, with exactly 5 edges.\n\nBut a 2-regular graph on v vertices has e = v edges (since sum degrees = 2v = 2e ⇒ e = v). Here v = 5, e = 5. So yes.\n\nSo we need number of 2-regular multigraphs on 5 labeled vertices with 5 edges, where each edge is an unordered pair {i,j}, i≠j (no loops, since roles are distinct and player chooses two *different* roles).\n\nSo it's number of 2-regular simple graphs on 5 labeled vertices? But a 2-regular simple graph is a disjoint union of cycles. On 5 vertices, possible cycle structures:\n\n- One 5-cycle  \n- One 3-cycle + one 2-cycle → but 2-cycle not allowed (needs two vertices with two parallel edges, or a loop — not allowed). So only possibility is a 5-cycle.\n\nBut wait: in simple graph, 2-regular means each vertex degree 2 ⇒ disjoint cycles covering all vertices. With 5 vertices, only possibility is a single 5-cycle.\n\nNumber of undirected 5-cycles on labeled vertices: $\\frac{(5-1)!}{2} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12$. Because number of cyclic orderings of 5 labeled vertices is $(5-1)! = 24$, and each cycle counted twice (clockwise/counter), so 12.\n\nBut hold on — is that the number of 2-regular *simple* graphs? Yes, only 5-cycles.\n\nBut in our case, the \"edges\" correspond to players' choices: each player contributes an edge. So 5 edges. In a 5-cycle, there are 5 edges — perfect.\n\nSo if all subsets are distinct and form a 5-cycle, that works.\n\nBut can there be repeated edges? For example, could two players both choose roles {1,2}? Then role 1 appears in those two players, so already twice — then no other player can choose role 1. Similarly role 2 appears twice. So if one pair is chosen twice, then those two roles are \"filled\", and remaining 3 players must choose among remaining 3 roles, each picking 2 roles, but roles 1 and 2 are done.\n\nSuppose player 1 and 2 both choose {1,2}. Then role 1 count = 2, role 2 count = 2. Remaining roles 3,4,5 need to reach count 2 each, with 3 players left, each choosing 2 roles from {3,4,5}. Each of those players chooses a 2-subset of {3,4,5}, i.e., one of {3,4}, {3,5}, {4,5}.\n\nThere are 3 possible pairs. We need total appearances of 3,4,5 to be 2 each, over 3 players.\n\nLet x = number of players choosing {3,4}, y = {3,5}, z = {4,5}, with x+y+z = 3.\n\nThen count of role 3 = x + y = 2  \nRole 4 = x + z = 2  \nRole 5 = y + z = 2  \n\nAdd all three: 2(x+y+z) = 6 ⇒ x+y+z = 3, consistent.\n\nSolve:\nx + y = 2  \nx + z = 2  \ny + z = 2  \n\nSubtract first two: y − z = 0 ⇒ y = z  \nThen from y + z = 2 ⇒ 2y = 2 ⇒ y = 1, z = 1, then x = 1.\n\nSo x=y=z=1.\n\nSo one player chooses {3,4}, one {3,5}, one {4,5}.\n\nSo this is possible: the multiset of subsets is: {1,2}, {1,2}, {3,4}, {3,5}, {4,5}.\n\nCheck counts:\n- Role 1: in first two → 2  \n- Role 2: in first two → 2  \n- Role 3: in {3,4} and {3,5} → 2  \n- Role 4: in {3,4} and {4,5} → 2  \n- Role 5: in {3,5} and {4,5} → 2  \n\nYes! So this is a valid configuration, and it includes a repeated pair.\n\nSo the graph can have multiple edges — it's a 2-regular multigraph (no loops), i.e., a 2-regular graph allowing parallel edges.\n\nSo we need number of 5-edge multigraphs on 5 labeled vertices, no loops, each vertex degree 2.\n\nEquivalently: number of 2-regular multigraphs on [5] with 5 edges.\n\nSince sum of degrees is 10, and 5 edges, average degree 2, and we require each degree exactly 2.\n\nSo it's the number of ways to write a 2-regular multigraph on 5 labeled vertices.\n\nSuch a multigraph is a disjoint union of cycles, where each cycle has length at least 2, and for length 2, it's a double edge between two vertices.\n\nSo possible cycle type decompositions for degree sequence all 2, 5 vertices:\n\n- One 5-cycle  \n- One 3-cycle + one 2-cycle (i.e., a double edge)  \n- One 4-cycle + one 1-cycle → no loops  \n- Two cycles: could be 2-cycle + 3-cycle, as above  \n- Three cycles: e.g., 2-cycle + 2-cycle + 1-cycle → no  \n- Or 2-cycle + 2-cycle + 1-cycle invalid  \n- 2-cycle + 2-cycle + 2-cycle would be 6 vertices  \nSo with 5 vertices, possibilities:\n\n- 5-cycle  \n- 3-cycle + double edge (2-cycle) on remaining 2 vertices  \n\nThat's it, since 5 = 5 or 3+2.\n\nCan't have 4+1 (loop), or 2+2+1, etc.\n\nSo two cases.\n\nLet’s count both.\n\n**Case 1: One 5-cycle**\n\nNumber of undirected 5-cycles on labeled vertices 1–5.\n\nAs before: number of ways to arrange 5 vertices in a cycle, up to rotation and reflection.\n\nStandard formula: $\\frac{(5-1)!}{2} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12$.\n\nEach 5-cycle has 5 edges, all distinct, no multiples.\n\nSo 12 such simple graphs.\n\nBut in our problem, the players are *distinguishable*: player 1 to player 5. So we need to assign the 5 edges to the 5 players — i.e., order matters.\n\nIn the matrix view, rows are labeled (players), so different assignments to different players count as different.\n\nSo for a given multiset of 5 edges (with multiplicities), the number of ways to assign them to 5 labeled players is the number of sequences (ordered 5-tuples) of edges whose multiset is that.\n\nSo for a 5-cycle with 5 distinct edges, number of ways to assign to 5 players is $5! = 120$, since all edges distinct.\n\nBut wait — no: the edges are determined by the cycle, but multiple cycles may give same edge set? No, a 5-cycle has a specific set of 5 edges.\n\nBut different cycles can have same edge set? No, edge set determines the cycle up to direction, but since undirected, yes.\n\nActually, for a fixed set of 5 edges forming a 5-cycle, how many ways to assign them to players? Since players are ordered, and edges may repeat or not.\n\nIn case all 5 edges are distinct, then number of ways to assign them to 5 players is $5!$ = 120, because it's bijection from players to edges.\n\nBut is that correct? Each player chooses an unordered pair; so if we have a set of 5 distinct pairs, then assigning which player chooses which pair is $5!$.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each 5-cycle (as a set of 5 edges), there are $5!$ assignments.\n\nHow many distinct 5-cycle edge sets are there? That's the number of 5-cycles as subgraphs = 12, as above.\n\nSo contribution from 5-cycles: $12 \\times 120 = 1440$.\n\nBut wait — is that right? Let's verify with smaller case.\n\nSuppose n=3 players, 3 roles, each chooses 2 roles, want each role chosen twice.\n\nThen total choices = 6, each role appears twice.\n\nWith 3 roles, each player chooses 2 out of 3, so possible choices: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3} — three possible pairs.\n\nEach player chooses one of these.\n\nWe need total count of each role = 2.\n\nLet x = # players choosing {1,2}, y = # choosing {1,3}, z = # choosing {2,3}, x+y+z = 3.\n\nRole 1 count = x + y = 2  \nRole 2 count = x + z = 2  \nRole 3 count = y + z = 2  \n\nThen x=y=z=1, as before.\n\nSo only possibility is one of each pair.\n\nNumber of ways to assign to 3 labeled players: number of bijections from players to the three pairs = $3! = 6$.\n\nAnd indeed, earlier we said $A(3,2) = 6$, matches.\n\nIn that case, the edge multiset is {{1,2},{1,3},{2,3}}, which is the complete graph $K_3$, a 3-cycle.\n\nNumber of 3-cycles on 3 vertices: only one (since only one set of 3 edges), and $3! = 6$ assignments.\n\nSo yes, method works.\n\nBack to n=5.\n\nCase 1: all 5 edges distinct, forming a 5-cycle.\n\nNumber of 5-cycles (as edge sets) on K_5: standard result is $\\frac{1}{2} \\binom{5}{5} (5-1)! = \\frac{24}{2} = 12$, yes.\n\nSo 12 edge sets.\n\nEach gives $5! = 120$ assignments.\n\nContribution: $12 \\times 120 = 1440$.\n\nCase 2: a 3-cycle on three vertices, and a double edge on the other two vertices.\n\nSo partition vertices into a set A of 3 vertices and set B of 2 vertices.\n\n- Choose which 3 vertices are in the 3-cycle: $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways. The remaining 2 are in the double edge.\n\n- Number of 3-cycles on 3 labeled vertices: only one undirected cycle: edges {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,1}. So for any 3-set, exactly one 3-cycle (since it's complete, only one way to make a cycle).\n\nSo 10 ways to choose the 3-set, and for each, 1 cycle.\n\n- Double edge on the 2-set: only one way — the pair appears twice.\n\nSo the multiset of edges is: the three edges of the 3-cycle, plus two copies of the pair for the 2-set.\n\nSo total edges: 3 + 2 = 5, with one edge repeated.\n\nSo the multiset has 4 distinct edges? No: 3 distinct from triangle, and one edge repeated, so total distinct edges = 4, with multiplicities: three singles, one double.\n\nNow, number of ways to assign these 5 edges (with one repeat) to 5 labeled players.\n\nThe multiset has five elements: e1,e2,e3,e4,e4 (where e4 is the double edge).\n\nNumber of distinct sequences (ordered 5-tuples) with this multiset is $\\frac{5!}{2!} = 60$, since one edge appears twice.\n\nSo for each such partition, we have 60 assignments.\n\nNumber of partitions: choose the 2-set for the double edge: $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$, then the 3-set is determined. And for each 2-set, only one double edge (the pair itself). For the 3-set, only one 3-cycle (as it's complete, only one set of 3 edges forming a cycle).\n\nSo 10 choices.\n\nThus contribution: $10 \\times 60 = 600$.\n\nAre there other cases?\n\nWhat about a 4-cycle plus an isolated vertex? No, isolated vertex would have degree 0, but we need degree 2 for all.\n\nOr a double edge plus another double edge plus a single edge? That would be 2+2+1=5 edges, but degrees: each double edge contributes degree 2 to its two vertices, so two double edges cover 4 vertices, each degree 2, and the fifth vertex needs degree 2, so it must be incident to the single edge, but a single edge gives degree 1 to each end, so can't give degree 2 to one vertex alone. So impossible.\n\nOr three double edges: would require 6 vertices.\n\nSo only two cases: 5-cycle, or 3-cycle + double edge.\n\nSo total $T(\\text{favorable}) = 1440 + 600 = 2040$.\n\nWait, but let's verify with known value.\n\nI recall that $A(5,2)$, number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with row and column sums 2, is indeed 2025? Or 2040?\n\nLet me cross-check.\n\nWe can compute $A(5,2)$ using formula:\n\n$$\nA(n,k) = \\sum_{\\lambda} \\frac{(n!)^2}{\\prod_i (\\lambda_i)! \\prod_j (\\mu_j)!} \\times \\text{something}\n$$\n\nNo.\n\nUse the fact that it's equal to the number of 2-factorizations or known tables.\n\nUpon quick search in mind: OEIS A001499: Number of n X n (0,1)-matrices with exactly k 1's in each row and column.\n\nValues:\n\n- n=1: k=1 → 1  \n- n=2: k=1 → 2, k=2 → 1  \n- n=3: k=1 → 6, k=2 → 6  \n- n=4: k=1 → 24, k=2 → 90, k=3 → 90  \n- n=5: k=1 → 120, k=2 → ?  \n\nI think k=2 is 2025. Let me see if 2040 makes sense.\n\nOur calculation gave 2040.\n\nBut let's double-check case 2.\n\nCase 2: 3-cycle on vertices A,B,C: edges AB,BC,CA.\n\nDouble edge on D,E: edge DE twice.\n\nSo edge multiset: {AB, BC, CA, DE, DE}.\n\nNumber of ways to assign to 5 players: number of sequences of length 5 where DE appears twice, others once.\n\nYes, $\\frac{5!}{2!} = 60$.\n\nNumber of ways to choose which 3 vertices for triangle: $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$, and for each, only one triangle (since on 3 vertices, only one 3-cycle).\n\nSo 10 × 60 = 600.\n\nCase 1: 5-cycle.\n\nNumber of 5-cycles as subgraphs of K_5.\n\nNumber of ways to choose a 5-cycle: fix vertex 1, choose two neighbors, etc.\n\nStandard formula: number of undirected Hamiltonian cycles in K_n is $\\frac{(n-1)!}{2}$.\n\nFor n=5: $\\frac{4!}{2} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12$, yes.\n\nEach corresponds to a set of 5 edges.\n\nAssigning to 5 players: since all edges distinct, $5! = 120$ ways.\n\n12 × 120 = 1440.\n\nTotal 1440 + 600 = 2040.\n\nSo $T(\\text{favorable}) = 2040$.\n\nNow the problem says:\n\n> Compute the smallest positive integer $n$ such that  \n> $$\\frac{\\|1\\|+\\|2\\|+\\cdots+\\|n\\|}{n} = T(\\text{favorable}) - 1940$$\n\nWe have $T = 2040$, so RHS = $2040 - 1940 = 100$.\n\nSo we need smallest $n$ such that average of $\\|k\\|$ from 1 to $n$ is 100:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\|k\\| = 100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\sum_{k=1}^n \\|k\\| = 100n\n$$\n\nSo define $S(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\|k\\|$, and find smallest $n$ with $S(n) = 100n$.\n\nRecall $\\|k\\| = \\min( |k - m^2| )$ over integers $m$, i.e., distance to nearest square.\n\nSo for each $k$, find nearest square and take absolute difference.\n\nSquares: $0^2 = 0$, $1^2 = 1$, $2^2 = 4$, $3^2 = 9$, $4^2 = 16$, $5^2 = 25$, $6^2 = 36$, $7^2 = 49$, $8^2 = 64$, $9^2 = 81$, $10^2 = 100$, $11^2 = 121$, $12^2 = 144$, $13^2 = 169$, $14^2 = 196$, $15^2 = 225$, etc.\n\nNote: for $k$ between $m^2$ and $(m+1)^2$, the nearest square is either $m^2$ or $(m+1)^2$, and the midpoint is at $m^2 + m + 0.5$, since distance from $m^2$ to $(m+1)^2$ is $2m+1$, so halfway is $m^2 + m + 0.5$.\n\nSo for integer $k$, if $k \\le m^2 + m$, then nearest square is $m^2$, else $(m+1)^2$.\n\nBecause:\n\n- Distance to $m^2$: $k - m^2$  \n- Distance to $(m+1)^2$: $(m+1)^2 - k = m^2 + 2m + 1 - k$  \n- Set equal: $k - m^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1 - k \\Rightarrow 2k = 2m^2 + 2m + 1 \\Rightarrow k = m^2 + m + 0.5$\n\nSo for $k \\le m^2 + m$, $\\|k\\| = k - m^2$  \nFor $k \\ge m^2 + m + 1$, $\\|k\\| = (m+1)^2 - k$\n\nAt $k = m^2 + m + 1$, distance to $(m+1)^2$ is $(m+1)^2 - (m^2 + m + 1) = m^2 + 2m + 1 - m^2 - m - 1 = m$, and to $m^2$ is $m^2 + m + 1 - m^2 = m + 1$, so yes, nearer to $(m+1)^2$.\n\nSo in interval $[m^2, (m+1)^2]$, length $2m+1$, the values of $\\|k\\|$ are:\n\n- At $k = m^2$: 0  \n- $k = m^2 + 1$: 1  \n- ...  \n- $k = m^2 + m$: m  \n- $k = m^2 + m + 1$: m (since distance to $(m+1)^2$ is $(m+1)^2 - (m^2 + m + 1) = m$)  \n- $k = m^2 + m + 2$: m-1  \n- ...  \n- $k = (m+1)^2$: 0  \n\nSo the sequence is symmetric: 0,1,2,...,m,m,m-1,...,2,1,0 — total $2m+1$ terms.\n\nFrom $m^2$ to $(m+1)^2$ inclusive is $(m+1)^2 - m^2 + 1 = 2m + 2$? Wait: $(m+1)^2 - m^2 = 2m + 1$, so number of integers from $m^2$ to $(m+1)^2$ inclusive is $(2m+1) + 1 = 2m+2$.\n\nBut earlier we said length $2m+1$ — mistake.\n\nSquares: $m^2$, then next is $(m+1)^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1$, so integers from $m^2$ to $(m+1)^2$ inclusive: that's $(m^2 + 2m + 1) - m^2 + 1 = 2m + 2$ numbers.\n\nBut the distances: at $k=m^2$: 0  \n$k=m^2 + 1$: 1  \n...  \n$k=m^2 + m$: m  \n$k=m^2 + m + 1$: ? distance to $m^2$ is $m+1$, to $(m+1)^2$ is $(m+1)^2 - (m^2 + m + 1) = m^2 + 2m + 1 - m^2 - m - 1 = m$, so $\\|k\\| = m$  \n$k=m^2 + m + 2$: distance to $(m+1)^2$ is $m-1$  \n...  \n$k=(m+1)^2$: 0  \n\nSo the values are:\n\n- $k = m^2 + i$ for $i = 0$ to $m$: $\\|k\\| = i$  \n- $k = m^2 + m + 1 + j$ for $j = 0$ to $m$: $\\|k\\| = m - j$  \n\nWhen $j=0$: $k=m^2 + m + 1$, $\\|k\\|=m$  \n$j=1$: $k=m^2 + m + 2$, $\\|k\\|=m-1$  \n...  \n$j=m$: $k=m^2 + 2m + 1 = (m+1)^2$, $\\|k\\|=0$\n\nSo i from 0 to m: m+1 values  \nj from 0 to m: m+1 values  \nBut $k=m^2 + m + 1 + j$, when j=0, k=m^2 + m + 1; j=m, k=m^2 + 2m + 1 = (m+1)^2  \nSo total values: from $m^2$ to $(m+1)^2$ inclusive is $(m+1)^2 - m^2 + 1 = 2m + 2$ values, and we have (m+1) + (m+1) = 2m+2, good.\n\nAnd the sequence of $\\|k\\|$ is:  \n0,1,2,...,m, m,m-1,...,1,0\n\nSo it increases from 0 to m, then stays at m for one more, then decreases to 0.\n\nSo sum over $k = m^2$ to $(m+1)^2$ of $\\|k\\|$ is:\n\nSum_{i=0}^m i + Sum_{j=0}^m (m - j) = Sum_{i=0}^m i + Sum_{k=0}^m k = 2 * \\frac{m(m+1)}{2} = m(m+1)\n\nSum_{i=0}^m i = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}, yes.\n\nSo total sum over the block from $m^2$ to $(m+1)^2$ is $m(m+1)$.\n\nBut note: this block includes both endpoints, and has $2m+2$ numbers.\n\nNow, for our sum $S(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\|k\\|$, we need to compute cumulative sum.\n\nNote that $k=1$ is $1^2$, so start from m=1.\n\nList squares and blocks.\n\n- Between $0^2 = 0$ and $1^2 = 1$: k=0,1. But we start from k=1, so k=1: $\\|1\\| = 0$ (since 1 is square).\n\n- Next block: from $1^2 = 1$ to $2^2 = 4$: k=1,2,3,4. Length = 4 - 1 + 1 = 4 = 2*1 + 2, yes.\n\nm=1: sum = m(m+1) = 1*2 = 2.\n\nCompute manually: k=1:0, k=2: |2-1|=1 or |2-4|=2 → min=1, k=3: |3-1|=2, |3-4|=1 → min=1, k=4:0. Sum=0+1+1+0=2. Yes.\n\n- m=2: from $4$ to $9$: k=4,5,6,7,8,9. Length=6=2*2+2. Sum=m(m+1)=2*3=6.\n\nCheck: k=4:0, k=5:1, k=6:2, k=7:2 (dist to 4 is 3, to 9 is 2), k=8:1, k=9:0. Sum=0+1+2+2+1+0=6. Yes.\n\n- m=3: 9 to 16: sum=3*4=12  \n- m=4: 16 to 25: sum=4*5=20  \n- m=5: 25 to 36: sum=5*6=30  \n- m=6: 36 to 49: sum=6*7=42  \n- m=7: 49 to 64: sum=7*8=56  \n- m=8: 64 to 81: sum=8*9=72  \n- m=9: 81 to 100: sum=9*10=90  \n- m=10: 100 to 121: sum=10*11=110  \n- etc.\n\nNow, $S(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\|k\\|$.\n\nWe need $S(n) = 100n$.\n\nSince $\\|k\\|$ is generally small, around sqrt(k), the average grows like sqrt(n)/3 or something, but here we need average 100, so n must be large, around where $\\|k\\|$ averages 100, i.e., near squares of size ~200, since distance to nearest square can be up to ~100.\n\nMaximum $\\|k\\|$ in block m is m, achieved at the \"middle\" points.\n\nSo to have average 100, we need m around 100, so n around $100^2 = 10000$.\n\nBut let's see the behavior.\n\nNote that for large m, in block from $m^2$ to $(m+1)^2$, sum is $m(m+1) \\approx m^2$, and length is $2m+2 \\approx 2m$, so average in block is $\\frac{m^2}{2m} = m/2$.\n\nSo to have overall average 100, we need m/2 ≈ 100 ⇒ m ≈ 200.\n\nSo n around $200^2 = 40000$.\n\nBut let's compute cumulative sum.\n\nDefine $S(M) = \\sum_{k=1}^{M^2} \\|k\\|$, i.e., sum up to perfect square $M^2$.\n\nNote that k=1 = 1^2, so include from 1.\n\nThe blocks are:\n\n- From $1^2 = 1$ to $2^2 = 4$: m=1, sum=2  \n- $2^2=4$ to $3^2=9$: but overlap at 4. To avoid double-counting, better to define blocks as $[m^2, (m+1)^2)$ or disjoint.\n\nStandard way: the intervals $[m^2, (m+1)^2)$ for m≥0.\n\n- m=0: [0,1): k=0 only  \n- m=1: [1,4): k=1,2,3  \n- m=2: [4,9): k=4,5,6,7,8  \n- m=3: [9,16): k=9 to 15  \n- etc.\n\nBut our sum starts at k=1, and $\\|k\\|$ for k in [m^2, (m+1)^2) is as before, but excluding the right endpoint.\n\nTo simplify, since the function is symmetric and we can compute sum up to $N^2$.\n\nNote that sum from $k = m^2$ to $(m+1)^2$ inclusive is $m(m+1)$, as established.\n\nBut this includes both endpoints, and for consecutive m, the blocks overlap at endpoints.\n\nSo better to define sum from $k = m^2 + 1$ to $(m+1)^2 - 1$, i.e., interior.\n\nBut perhaps compute $S(n)$ incrementally.\n\nSince we need $S(n) = 100n$, and $S(n)$ is roughly integral of distance to nearest square.\n\nThe average of $\\|k\\|$ up to $n$ is approximately $\\frac{1}{3} \\sqrt{n}$ for large n? Let's think.\n\nIn each block of length ~2m, sum ~m^2, so average ~m/2, and m ~ sqrt(k), so average ~ sqrt(k)/2.\n\nSo to have average 100, need sqrt(n)/2 ≈ 100 ⇒ sqrt(n) ≈ 200 ⇒ n ≈ 40000.\n\nSo try n = 40000.\n\nBut we need exact smallest n.\n\nNote that $S(n)$ is a piecewise quadratic function.\n\nLet’s find n such that $S(n) = 100n$.\n\nConsider n = t^2.\n\nThen $S(t^2) = \\sum_{k=1}^{t^2} \\|k\\|$.\n\nThe blocks are from $m=1$ to $m=t-1$: block m goes from $m^2$ to $(m+1)^2$, but again overlap.\n\nBetter: sum from k=1 to N, where N = M^2.\n\nThe values k=1 to M^2 include:\n\n- k=1 = 1^2: || = 0  \n- Then for each m from 1 to M-1, the interval from $m^2$ to $(m+1)^2$ inclusive, but as noted, overlapping.\n\nStandard approach: the sum $S(N)$ can be computed as sum over m of contributions.\n\nI recall that the sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\|k\\|$ has been studied, but perhaps we can solve numerically.\n\nSince the problem likely expects a nice answer, and T(favorable) - 1940 = 100, and 100 is nice, perhaps n is a perfect square.\n\nAssume n = a^2.\n\nThen S(a^2) = sum_{k=1}^{a^2} ||k||.\n\nNow, for each m from 1 to a-1, the block from m^2 to (m+1)^2 inclusive has sum m(m+1), but includes (m+1)^2 which is also start of next block.\n\nTo avoid double-counting, consider disjoint intervals: [1,1], [2,3], [4,8], [9,15], etc., but messy.\n\nNote that for k from 1 to M^2, the number of k with ||k|| = d.\n\nBut perhaps compute S(n) for n near 40000.\n\nBut there might be a closed form.\n\nObserve that for each m ≥ 1, in the range k = m^2 - m + 1 to m^2 + m, the nearest square is m^2, and ||k|| = |k - m^2|.\n\nThe length of this range is 2m, from m^2 - m + 1 to m^2 + m.\n\nFor example, m=1: 1-1+1=1 to 1+1=2: k=1,2. ||1||=0, ||2||=1.\n\nm=2: 4-2+1=3 to 4+2=6: k=3,4,5,6. ||3||=1, ||4||=0, ||5||=1, ||6||=2.\n\nBut ||6||=2, and distance to 9 is 3, so yes.\n\nThe range where m^2 is nearest is from m^2 - m + 1 to m^2 + m, inclusive, length 2m.\n\nAt the boundaries, it ties, but we defined nearest, and at tie, it's equidistant, but the problem says \"the nearest perfect square\", and if tie, which one? For example, k=2: dist to 1 is 1, to 4 is 2, so 1 is nearer. k=5: dist to 4 is 1, to 9 is 4. k=8: dist to 9 is 1, to 4 is 4. k=10: dist to 9 is 1, to 16 is 6. The tie occurs at midpoints, like k=2.5 between 1 and 4, but for integers, when is distance equal? When k - m^2 = (m+1)^2 - k ⇒ k = m^2 + m + 0.5, not integer, so no ties for integer k. So always unique nearest square.\n\nSo for each k, unique m such that ||k|| = |k - m^2|, and m is floor(sqrt(k)) or ceil(sqrt(k)), whichever closer.\n\nAnd the range where m^2 is nearest is from m^2 - m + 1 to m^2 + m.\n\nFor m=1: 1-1+1=1 to 1+1=2: k=1,2  \nFor m=2: 4-2+1=3 to 4+2=6: k=3,4,5,6  \nFor m=3: 9-3+1=7 to 9+3=12: k=7,8,9,10,11,12  \nLength 2m.\n\nAnd for k in this range, ||k|| = |k - m^2|.\n\nSo sum over k in [m^2 - m + 1, m^2 + m] of ||k|| = sum_{d=0}^{m-1} d + sum_{d=0}^{m} d? Let's see.\n\nFor k from m^2 - m + 1 to m^2: that's m values: k = m^2 - m + 1, ..., m^2, so distances: 1,2,...,m? No.\n\nk = m^2 - i, for i = 0 to m-1: distance i.\n\nk = m^2 - m + 1 = m^2 - (m-1), so i = m-1 down to 0.\n\nSo distances: for k = m^2 - (m-1) to m^2: distances 1,2,...,m-1,0? Let's list.\n\nFor m=3: range k=7 to 12.\n\nm^2 = 9.\n\nk=7: |7-9|=2  \nk=8:1  \nk=9:0  \nk=10:1  \nk=11:2  \nk=12:3  \n\nSo values: 2,1,0,1,2,3\n\nNot symmetric.\n\nEarlier we had for [m^2, (m+1)^2] it is symmetric, but here it's different.\n\nPerhaps stick to the first method.\n\nGiven time, and that this is a contest problem, likely T(favorable) = 2040 is correct, so RHS = 100, and the smallest n with average 100 is n = 40000, but let's verify with a small calculation.\n\nSuppose n = 4m^2, then average might be m/2, so for average 100, m=200, n=4*40000=160000? No.\n\nFrom earlier, in block m, average is m/2, and block ends at (m+1)^2 ≈ m^2, so at n = m^2, the average is roughly m/2, so for average 100, m=200, n=40000.\n\nAssume n = 40000 = 200^2.\n\nThen S(40000) = sum_{k=1}^{40000} ||k||.\n\nThe blocks are for m from 1 to 199: block from m^2 to (m+1)^2 inclusive has sum m(m+1), but overlaps.\n\nSum from k=1 to M^2 can be computed as sum over m=1 to M-1 of sum from k=m^2 to (m+1)^2 minus overlaps, but it's messy.\n\nPerhaps the problem intends T(favorable) = 2040, and the answer is n=40000.\n\nBut let's check if there's a smaller n.\n\nSuppose n = 2m^2, then average might be m/2.\n\nSet m/2 = 100, m=200, n=80000.\n\nBut earlier logic suggested n≈40000.\n\nPerhaps compute S(n) for n=100.\n\nSquares up to 100: 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100.\n\nSum ||k|| from 1 to 100.\n\nWe can compute sum over each block.\n\nBlock m=1: k=1 to 4, sum=2  \nm=2: k=4 to 9, but overlap, so better k=5 to 8: for k=5,6,7,8: ||5||=1, ||6||=2, ||7||=2, ||8||=1, sum=6  \nBut k=4 is in previous.\n\nStandard way: sum from k=1 to N is sum over all k.\n\nSince it's tedious, and this is taking too long, and given that in many similar problems, the answer is 40000, and 2040 - 1940 = 100, and 100^2 = 10000, but average 100 suggests n=40000.\n\nPerhaps n=10000.\n\nIf n=10000=100^2, then average 100 would require S(10000)=10^6.\n\nIs that reasonable? Sum of ||k|| up to 10000.\n\nIn each block m, sum ~m^2, number of blocks up to m=100 is about 100, sum of m^2 from 1 to 100 is about 100^3/3 ≈ 333333, less than 10^6.\n\nSum of m^2 from 1 to M is M(M+1)(2M+1)/6.\n\nFor M=100: 100*101*201/6 = (100*101*201)/6.\n\n100/2=50, so 50*101*201/3 = 50*101*67 = 50*6767 = 338350.\n\nBut this is sum of m^2, while our sum per block is m(m+1) ≈ m^2, and number of blocks from m=1 to 99 is 99, sum m(m+1) = sum m^2 + sum m = 338350 + 4950 = 343300.\n\nSo S(10000) ≈ 343300, while 100*10000 = 10^6, too small.\n\nFor n=40000=200^2, sum m(m+1) from m=1 to 199 = sum m^2 + sum m = [199*200*399/6] + [199*200/2].\n\nCompute approx: 199≈200, so sum m^2 ≈ 200^3/3 = 8,000,000/3 ≈ 2,666,667, sum m ≈ 200^2/2 = 20,000, total ≈ 2,686,667.\n\n100*40000 = 4,000,000, still less.\n\nFor n=90000=300^2, sum m^2 to 299 ≈ 299^3/3 ≈ 27,000,000/3 = 9,000,000, close to 100*90000 = 9,000,000.\n\nSo n=90000.\n\nSum m(m+1) from m=1 to M-1 for n=M^2.\n\nSum_{m=1}^{M-1} m(m+1) = sum m^2 + sum m = \\frac{(M-1)M(2M-1)}{6} + \\frac{(M-1)M}{2} = \\frac{(M-1)M}{6} [2M-1 + 3] = \\frac{(M-1)M(2M+2)}{6} = \\frac{(M-1)M(M+1)}{3}\n\nSince 2M+2 = 2(M+1), so \\frac{(M-1)M \\cdot 2(M+1)}{6} = \\frac{(M-1)M(M+1)}{3}\n\nYes.\n\nSo S(M^2) = \\frac{(M-1)M(M+1)}{3}\n\nThis is sum from k=1 to M^2 of ||k||, assuming the blocks cover exactly and no overlap, but does it?\n\nFor M=2: S(4) = ||1||+||2||+||3||+||4|| = 0+1+1+0 = 2\n\nFormula: (2-1)*2*(2+1)/3 = 1*2*3/3 = 2, good.\n\nM=3: S(9) = sum k=1 to 9.\n\nFrom earlier: block m=1: k=1-4 sum=2  \nm=2: k=4-9 sum=6, but k=4 counted twice.\n\nActual sum: k=1:0,2:1,3:1,4:0,5:1,6:2,7:2,8:1,9:0.

Sum=1+2+3+3+2+1+0=12, total 8+12=20, yes.\n\nSo formula S(M^2) = \\frac{(M-1)M(M+1)}{3} is correct.\n\nGreat!\n\nSo for n = M^2, S(n) = \\frac{(M-1)M(M+1)}{3}\n\nWe need S(n) = 100n = 100 M^2\n\nSo \\frac{(M-1)M(M+1)}{3} = 100 M^2\n\nAssume M ≠ 0, divide both sides by M:\n\n\\frac{(M-1)(M+1)}{3} = 100 M\n\nSo \\frac{M^2 - 1}{3} = 100 M\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\nM^2 - 1 = 300 M\n\nSo M^2 - 300M - 1 = 0\n\nSolve: M = [300 ± sqrt(90000 + 4)]/2 = [300 ± sqrt(90004)]/2\n\nsqrt(90004) = ? 300^2 = 90000, so sqrt(90004) = sqrt(90000 + 4) ≈ 300 + 4/(2*300) = 300 + 1/150 ≈ 300.00666, not integer.\n\nSo no perfect square solution.\n\nBut we need smallest n, not necessarily square.\n\nHowever, the equation is S(n) = 100n.\n\nS(n) is integer, 100n integer, so ok.\n\nSince S(n) is increasing, and for n = M^2, S(M^2) = \\frac{(M-1)M(M+1)}{3}\n\nSet f(M) = S(M^2) - 100 M^2 = \\frac{(M-1)M(M+1)}{3} - 100 M^2 = M [ \\frac{(M-1)(M+1)}{3} - 100 M ] = M [ \\frac{M^2 - 1 - 300 M}{3} ] = \\frac{M(M^2 - 300M - 1)}{3}\n\nSo for large M, this is negative when M^2 - 300M - 1 < 0, i.e., M < 300 + epsilon.\n\nAt M=300, f(300) = \\frac{300(90000 - 90000 - 1)}{3} = \\frac{300(-1)}{3} = -100\n\nAt M=301, f(301) = \\frac{301(301^2 - 300*301 - 1)}{3} = 301^2 = 90601, 300*301 = 90300, so 90601 - 90300 - 1 = 300, so f=301*300/3 = 301*100 = 30100 > 0\n\nSo S(300^2) = S(90000) = \\frac{299*300*301}{3} = 299*100*301 = 299*30100\n\nCompute 300*30100 = 9,030,000, minus 1*30100 = 9,030,000 - 30,100 = 8,999,900\n\n100*90000 = 9,000,000\n\nSo S(90000) = 8,999,900 < 9,000,000\n\nDifference = 100\n\nSo at n=90000, S(n) = 9,000,000 - 100 = 8,999,900\n\nWe need S(n) = 100n, so for n=90000, deficit 100.\n\nNow, what is ||k|| for k=90001,90002,etc.\n\n90000 = 300^2, so nearest square is 300^2 = 90000.\n\nSo for k=90001, ||k|| = 1  \nk=90002, ||k|| = 2  \n...\nk=90000 + d, ||k|| = d, until midpoint to next square.\n\nNext square is 301^2 = 90601.\n\nMidpoint between 300^2 and 301^2 is 90000 + 300.5 = 90300.5\n\nSo for k from 90001 to 90300, nearest square is 90000, ||k|| = k - 90000\n\nFor k=90301 to 90601, nearest is 90601, ||k|| = 90601 - k\n\nSo for k=90001, ||k|| = 1  \nk=90002, 2  \n...  \nk=90300, 300  \nk=90301, 300 (since 90601 - 90301 = 300)  \nk=90302, 299  \netc.\n\nSo to increase S(n) by 100, we need to go from n=90000 to n=90000 + d, where sum of ||k|| from 90001 to 90000+d = 100.\n\nSince ||90001|| = 1, ||90002|| = 2, etc., sum_{i=1}^d i = d(d+1)/2\n\nSet d(d+1)/2 = 100 ⇒ d^2 + d - 200 = 0 ⇒ d = [-1 ± sqrt(1+800)]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(801)]/2\n\nsqrt(801) ≈ 28.3, so d≈13.65, try d=14: 14*15/2 = 105 > 100  \nd=13: 13*14/2 = 91 < 100  \nSo at d=13, sum=91, need 9 more.\n\nBut ||90014|| = 14, too big.\n\nSo not sufficient.\n\nAfter k=90000, the values are 1,2,3,..., so cumulative sum is triangular numbers.\n\nAt n=90000 + d, S(n) = S(90000) + sum_{i=1}^d i = 8,999,900 + d(d+1)/2\n\nSet equal to 100n = 100(90000 + d) = 9,000,000 + 100d\n\nSo:\n\n8,999,900 + d(d+1)/2 = 9,000,000 + 100d\n\nSimplify:\n\nd(d+1)/2 - 100d = 100\n\nMultiply by 2:\n\nd(d+1) - 200d = 200\n\nd^2 + d - 200d = 200\n\nd^2 - 199d - 200 = 0\n\nSolve: d = [199 ± sqrt(199^2 + 800)]/2 = [199 ± sqrt(39601 + 800)]/2 = [199 ± sqrt(40401)]/2\n\nsqrt(40401) = ? 201^2 = 40401, yes! Because 200^2=40000, 201^2=40401.\n\nSo d = [199 ± 201]/2\n\nPositive: (199 + 201)/2 = 400/2 = 200\n\nSo d = 200\n\nThus n = 90000 + 200 = 90200\n\nCheck: S(90200) = S(90000) + sum_{i=1}^{200} i = 8,999,900 + 200*201/2 = 8,999,900 + 20100 = 9,020,000\n\n100n = 100*90200 = 9,020,000\n\nYes!\n\nSo n = 90200\n\nIs this the smallest? We assumed n > 90000, but maybe there is smaller n.\n\nAt M=300, S(90000) = 8,999,900 < 9,000,000, and S(n) increases by at least 1 each step, so the first time S(n) = 100n is at n=90200.\n\nTo confirm no smaller, check if for some n < 90000, S(n) = 100n.\n\nBut S(n) < 100n for n=90000, and for smaller n, the ratio S(n)/n is smaller (since average increases), so likely 90200 is smallest.\n\nThus answer is 90200.\n\nSo final answer.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We first computed T(favorable) as the number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with all row and column sums equal to 2, which corresponds to the number of ways 5 players can each choose 2 roles from 5 such that each role is chosen exactly twice. This equals the number of 2-regular bipartite graphs on K_{5,5}, which we calculated as 2040 (1440 from 5-cycles and 600 from 3-cycle plus double edge). Thus T(favorable) − 1940 = 100. We then solved for the smallest n such that the average of ||k|| from k=1 to n equals 100. Using the formula for the sum up to a perfect square, S(M²) = (M−1)M(M+1)/3, and solving S(n) = 100n, we found that at M = 300, S(90000) = 8,999,900, which is 100 less than 100×90000 = 9,000,000. Extending beyond 90000, we solved d² − 199d − 200 = 0 and found d = 200, giving n = 90000 + 200 = 90200, where S(90200) = 9,020,000 = 100×90200.\",\n    \"answer\": \"90200\"\n}",
