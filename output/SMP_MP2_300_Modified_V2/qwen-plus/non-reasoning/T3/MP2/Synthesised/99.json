  "math_problem": "A fat coin is one which, when tossed, has a $2 / 5$ probability of being heads, $2 / 5$ of being tails, and $1 / 5$ of landing on its edge. Mr. Fat starts at 0 on the real line. Every minute, he tosses a fat coin. If it's heads, he moves left, decreasing his coordinate by 1; if it's tails, he moves right, increasing his coordinate by 1. If the coin lands on its edge, he moves back to 0. If Mr. Fat does this ad infinitum, what fraction of his time will he spend at 0? Instead of finding the long-run proportion of time spent at the origin, simply find $r$, where $r$ is the factor less than 1 by which the stationary probability at distance $n$ from 0 relates to that at distance $n+1$, derived from the balance equations for the long-run proportions at non-zero positions. Let $Z$ be as in problem 15. Let $X$ be the greatest integer such that $|X Z| \\leq r + \\frac{9}{2}$. Find $X$.",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a stochastic process on the integers (the real line, but positions are integers), where Mr. Fat starts at 0 and at each minute:\n\n- With probability $ \\frac{2}{5} $: moves **left** → position decreases by 1  \n- With probability $ \\frac{2}{5} $: moves **right** → position increases by 1  \n- With probability $ \\frac{1}{5} $: lands on edge → moves **back to 0**\n\nWe are to find $ r $, defined as *the factor less than 1 by which the stationary probability at distance $ n $ from 0 relates to that at distance $ n+1 $*, i.e., for $ n \\ge 1 $, if $ \\pi_n = \\Pr(\\text{at position } n) $ in stationary distribution, then due to symmetry, $ \\pi_n = \\pi_{-n} $, and we define $ r = \\frac{\\pi_{n+1}}{\\pi_n} $ for $ n \\ge 1 $. So $ \\pi_n = \\pi_1 r^{n-1} $ for $ n \\ge 1 $.\n\nThen, let $ Z $ be “as in problem 15”. Since problem 15 is not provided, but this is likely a standard reference — perhaps from an AMC/AIME/competition context — we need to infer what $ Z $ is.\n\nBut wait — the problem says:  \n> Let $ Z $ be as in problem 15. Let $ X $ be the greatest integer such that $ |X Z| \\leq r + \\frac{9}{2} $. Find $ X $.\n\nSo we must determine $ r $ first, then presumably $ Z $ is known or standard. But since problem 15 is not given, maybe $ Z = 1 $? Or perhaps $ Z $ is the stationary probability at 0? Or maybe it's a typo or misdirection? Let’s read carefully.\n\nActually, re-examining: The problem says “Let $ Z $ be as in problem 15.” Since we don’t have problem 15, perhaps this is a red herring — or more likely, in the original source (e.g., an AoPS contest), problem 15 defines $ Z $, possibly as the expected return time or something. But since it's not provided, maybe $ Z = 1 $ is intended? Or perhaps $ Z $ is the *normalizing constant*? Unlikely.\n\nWait — maybe “Z” is a typo and should be “r”? No, it says “Let Z be as in problem 15”.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a known problem: the “fat coin” random walk with reset to 0. This is a well-known type of Markov chain with a central state (0) that acts as a reflecting/resetting state.\n\nLet’s proceed step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Model as a Markov chain on integers\n\nState space: $ \\mathbb{Z} $, but due to symmetry, stationary distribution satisfies $ \\pi_n = \\pi_{-n} $. So define:\n\n- $ \\pi_0 $: stationary prob at 0  \n- For $ n \\ge 1 $, $ \\pi_n = \\pi_{-n} $, and define $ a_n = \\pi_n $ for $ n \\ge 1 $\n\nSo total probability:  \n$$\n\\pi_0 + 2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n = 1\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Write balance equations\n\nFor state 0: inflow = outflow.\n\n- Outflow from 0:  \n  - To -1 (heads): prob $ \\frac{2}{5} $  \n  - To +1 (tails): prob $ \\frac{2}{5} $  \n  - Stay at 0? No — edge sends to 0, but from 0, edge means *you go to 0*, i.e., self-loop? Wait no: when at any position, you toss the coin; if edge, you move *to 0*. So from state 0, if edge, you stay at 0. So from 0, transitions:\n    - Heads → -1, prob $ \\frac{2}{5} $  \n    - Tails → +1, prob $ \\frac{2}{5} $  \n    - Edge → 0, prob $ \\frac{1}{5} $\n\nSo from 0, outflow to other states is $ \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{4}{5} $, and self-loop $ \\frac{1}{5} $.\n\nThus, balance at 0:\n\nInflow to 0 comes from:\n- Any state $ k \\ne 0 $: if edge occurs, go to 0 → each state $ k $ contributes $ \\pi_k \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} $\n- Also, from -1 via tails? No: from -1, tails → 0? Wait: from position $ k $, if tails → $ k+1 $, so from -1, tails → 0. Similarly, from +1, heads → 0.\n\nSo inflow to 0 is:\n\n- From -1 via tails: $ \\pi_{-1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = a_1 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} $  \n- From +1 via heads: $ \\pi_{1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = a_1 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} $  \n- From all $ k \\ne 0 $ via edge: $ \\sum_{k \\ne 0} \\pi_k \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{5}(1 - \\pi_0) $\n\nSo total inflow = $ \\frac{4}{5} a_1 + \\frac{1}{5}(1 - \\pi_0) $\n\nOutflow from 0 = $ \\pi_0 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} \\right) = \\frac{4}{5} \\pi_0 $ (since heads and tails leave 0; edge stays)\n\nSo balance at 0:\n\n$$\n\\frac{4}{5} a_1 + \\frac{1}{5}(1 - \\pi_0) = \\frac{4}{5} \\pi_0\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n$$\n4 a_1 + 1 - \\pi_0 = 4 \\pi_0 \\implies 4 a_1 + 1 = 5 \\pi_0 \\quad \\text{(Eq 0)}\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Balance at state $ n \\ge 2 $\n\nConsider $ n \\ge 2 $. Who can go to $ n $?\n\n- From $ n-1 $ via tails: $ \\pi_{n-1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} $  \n- From $ n+1 $ via heads: $ \\pi_{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} $  \n- From any $ k $ via edge? No — edge goes to 0, not to $ n $. So only nearest neighbors.\n\nAlso, no self-loop at $ n $ (no edge → stay; edge → 0). So outflow from $ n $ is:\n\n- Heads → $ n-1 $: $ \\frac{2}{5} $  \n- Tails → $ n+1 $: $ \\frac{2}{5} $  \n- Edge → 0: $ \\frac{1}{5} $\n\nSo total outflow = $ \\pi_n \\cdot 1 $, obviously.\n\nThus balance at $ n \\ge 2 $:\n\nInflow = outflow:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{5} \\pi_{n-1} + \\frac{2}{5} \\pi_{n+1} = \\pi_n \\quad \\text{(since outflow is } \\pi_n \\text{, but wait — no: balance is inflow = outflow, and outflow is } \\pi_n \\times 1 \\text{? No!)} \n$$\n\nHold on: In stationary distribution, for each state $ i $, total rate *into* $ i $ equals total rate *out of* $ i $. Since it's discrete-time, it's:\n\n$$\n\\pi_i = \\sum_j \\pi_j P_{j,i}\n$$\n\nSo for $ i = n \\ge 2 $:\n\n- Can come from $ j = n-1 $ via tails: $ P_{n-1,n} = \\frac{2}{5} $  \n- From $ j = n+1 $ via heads: $ P_{n+1,n} = \\frac{2}{5} $  \n- From any $ j $ via edge? No, edge goes to 0 only. So only those two.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\pi_n = \\frac{2}{5} \\pi_{n-1} + \\frac{2}{5} \\pi_{n+1}\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n$$\n5 \\pi_n = 2 \\pi_{n-1} + 2 \\pi_{n+1}\n\\Rightarrow 2 \\pi_{n+1} - 5 \\pi_n + 2 \\pi_{n-1} = 0 \\quad \\text{(Eq n ≥ 2)}\n$$\n\nThis is a linear homogeneous recurrence.\n\nAssume solution $ \\pi_n = A r^n $ for $ n \\ge 1 $. Since symmetric, and we expect decay as $ |n| $ grows, $ 0 < r < 1 $.\n\nPlug into recurrence:\n\n$$\n2 A r^{n+1} - 5 A r^n + 2 A r^{n-1} = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 2 r^{n+1} - 5 r^n + 2 r^{n-1} = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow r^{n-1} (2 r^2 - 5 r + 2) = 0\n$$\n\nSo characteristic equation:\n\n$$\n2 r^2 - 5 r + 2 = 0\n$$\n\nSolve:\n\nDiscriminant $ D = 25 - 16 = 9 $, so\n\n$$\nr = \\frac{5 \\pm 3}{4} = \\frac{8}{4}=2,\\ \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nSo roots: $ r = 2 $ and $ r = \\frac{1}{2} $. Since we want decaying probabilities as $ n \\to \\infty $, pick $ r = \\frac{1}{2} $. So\n\n$$\n\\pi_n = a_1 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{n-1}, \\quad n \\ge 1\n$$\n\nThus $ r = \\frac{1}{2} $. That matches “the factor less than 1 by which stationary probability at distance $ n $ relates to that at $ n+1 $”: indeed $ \\pi_{n+1}/\\pi_n = \\frac{1}{2} $.\n\nSo $ r = \\frac{1}{2} $.\n\n✅ So answer for $ r $ is $ \\frac{1}{2} $.\n\nNow: “Let $ Z $ be as in problem 15.” Since we don’t have problem 15, but this problem is likely from a known source — perhaps an old AIME or similar — and “problem 15” may define $ Z = 1 $, or maybe $ Z = \\pi_0 $, or maybe $ Z = $ expected return time.\n\nBut wait — the expression is $ |X Z| \\le r + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 $. So $ |X Z| \\le 5 $.\n\nWe need greatest integer $ X $ satisfying that.\n\nIf $ Z $ were 1, then $ |X| \\le 5 $ ⇒ greatest integer $ X = 5 $.\n\nBut is $ Z $ possibly something else?\n\nLet’s see if we can compute $ \\pi_0 $, maybe $ Z = \\pi_0 $. From earlier Eq 0:\n\n$$\n4 a_1 + 1 = 5 \\pi_0\n$$\n\nAnd $ a_1 = \\pi_1 $, and $ \\pi_n = \\pi_1 (1/2)^{n-1} $, so sum:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\pi_n = \\pi_1 \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (1/2)^k = \\pi_1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - 1/2} = 2 \\pi_1\n$$\n\nSo total mass away from 0 is $ 2 \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\pi_n = 2 \\cdot 2 \\pi_1 = 4 \\pi_1 $ (since both sides). Wait no: earlier we said $ \\pi_n = \\pi_{-n} = a_n $, and $ a_n = \\pi_1 (1/2)^{n-1} $. So\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n \\ne 0} \\pi_n = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\pi_n + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\pi_{-n} = 2 \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n = 2 \\cdot \\left[ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \\dots \\right] = 2 \\cdot \\left[ a_1 (1 + \\tfrac{1}{2} + \\tfrac{1}{4} + \\dots) \\right] = 2 \\cdot a_1 \\cdot 2 = 4 a_1\n$$\n\nYes, because geometric series sum = $ \\frac{1}{1 - 1/2} = 2 $.\n\nSo $ \\sum_{n \\ne 0} \\pi_n = 4 a_1 $, thus $ \\pi_0 = 1 - 4 a_1 $\n\nBut from Eq 0: $ 4 a_1 + 1 = 5 \\pi_0 $. Substitute $ \\pi_0 = 1 - 4 a_1 $:\n\nLHS: $ 4 a_1 + 1 $  \nRHS: $ 5(1 - 4 a_1) = 5 - 20 a_1 $  \nSo $ 4 a_1 + 1 = 5 - 20 a_1 \\Rightarrow 24 a_1 = 4 \\Rightarrow a_1 = \\frac{1}{6} $\n\nThen $ \\pi_0 = 1 - 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} $\n\nSo stationary probability at 0 is $ \\frac{1}{3} $. Maybe $ Z = \\pi_0 = \\frac{1}{3} $. Then $ |X Z| \\le 5 \\Rightarrow |X| \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\le 5 \\Rightarrow |X| \\le 15 $, so greatest integer $ X = 15 $.\n\nBut why would $ Z $ be $ \\pi_0 $? Unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe $ Z $ is the *expected return time* to 0. In Markov chains, for irreducible positive recurrent chain, $ \\pi_0 = 1 / \\mathbb{E}[T_0] $, where $ T_0 $ is return time to 0. So $ \\mathbb{E}[T_0] = 1 / \\pi_0 = 3 $. So $ Z = 3 $. Then $ |X \\cdot 3| \\le 5 \\Rightarrow |X| \\le 5/3 \\approx 1.666 $, so greatest integer $ X = 1 $.\n\nBut which is it?\n\nLet’s test consistency.\n\nWe found $ \\pi_0 = \\frac{1}{3} $, $ a_1 = \\frac{1}{6} $, $ a_2 = \\frac{1}{12} $, etc.\n\nCheck balance at $ n = 1 $ — we haven’t done that yet; the recurrence was for $ n \\ge 2 $. Need to verify $ n = 1 $ separately.\n\n### Balance at $ n = 1 $:\n\nWho goes to 1?\n\n- From 0 via tails: $ \\pi_0 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} $  \n- From 2 via heads: $ \\pi_2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} $  \n- From any $ k $ via edge? No.\n\nSo inflow = $ \\frac{2}{5} \\pi_0 + \\frac{2}{5} \\pi_2 $\n\nOutflow from 1:  \n- Heads → 0: $ \\frac{2}{5} $  \n- Tails → 2: $ \\frac{2}{5} $  \n- Edge → 0: $ \\frac{1}{5} $  \nSo total outflow probability weight = $ \\pi_1 \\cdot 1 $, but in balance equation:\n\n$$\n\\pi_1 = \\frac{2}{5} \\pi_0 + \\frac{2}{5} \\pi_2\n$$\n\nWe have $ \\pi_0 = \\frac{1}{3},\\ \\pi_1 = \\frac{1}{6},\\ \\pi_2 = \\frac{1}{12} $\n\nRHS = $ \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{2}{60} = \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{4}{30} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{1}{6} = \\pi_1 $. ✅ Good.\n\nSo distribution is consistent.\n\nNow back to $ Z $. Since problem says “Let $ Z $ be as in problem 15”, and we don’t have it, but in many contexts, especially if this is from AoPS Intermediate Counting or similar, problem 15 might define $ Z = \\pi_0 $ or $ Z = \\mathbb{E}[T_0] $. But without it, perhaps the problem expects us to assume $ Z = 1 $, as simplest.\n\nHowever, note the expression: $ |X Z| \\le r + \\frac{9}{2} = 5 $. If $ Z $ were fractional, $ X $ could be large; if $ Z $ were large, $ X $ small.\n\nBut the problem asks for “greatest integer $ X $ such that $ |X Z| \\le 5 $”. To maximize $ X $, we’d want smallest possible positive $ Z $. But $ Z $ is defined externally.\n\nWait — maybe “Z” is a typo and should be “r”? But it says “Let Z be as in problem 15”.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in problem 15, $ Z = 2 $? Or maybe $ Z = \\frac{1}{2} = r $? Then $ |X \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}| \\le 5 \\Rightarrow |X| \\le 10 \\Rightarrow X = 10 $.\n\nBut we need to resolve this.\n\nLet me search for similar problems online mentally: “fat coin random walk stationary distribution” — yes, this is a classic “random walk with restart” or “teleportation to origin”.\n\nIn such models, the stationary distribution often has geometric decay away from origin, and $ r $ is the ratio we found: $ \\frac{1}{2} $.\n\nNow, what could $ Z $ be? Perhaps $ Z = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\pi_n^2 $, but unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe problem 15 defines $ Z = 2 $, as in “twice something”.\n\nBut here's a thought: the problem says “Let $ X $ be the greatest integer such that $ |X Z| \\le r + \\frac{9}{2} $”. Since $ r + \\frac{9}{2} = 5 $, and answer is an integer, likely $ Z = 1 $, giving $ X = 5 $. That’s clean.\n\nMoreover, in competition problems, if a prior problem defines $ Z $, and it's not provided, often $ Z = 1 $ is default.\n\nAlso, $ X = 5 $ is simple and plausible.\n\nAlternatively, check if $ Z $ could be $ \\pi_0 = \\frac{1}{3} $: then $ X \\le 15 $, $ X = 15 $. But 15 seems large.\n\nOr $ Z = \\mathbb{E}[T_0] = 3 $: then $ X \\le 5/3 $, so $ X = 1 $.\n\nWhich is most reasonable?\n\nLet’s see the phrase: “Let $ Z $ be as in problem 15.” If problem 15 was about the same setup and asked for $ \\pi_0 $, then $ Z = \\frac{1}{3} $. But the problem says “instead of finding the long-run proportion… simply find $ r $”, implying $ r $ is intermediate, and $ Z $ is from prior.\n\nGiven that we computed $ \\pi_0 = \\frac{1}{3} $, and it's a nice fraction, and common to denote central probability as $ Z $, possible.\n\nBut then $ |X \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}| \\le 5 \\Rightarrow X \\le 15 $, so $ X = 15 $.\n\nSimilarly, if $ Z = \\frac{1}{2} $, $ X = 10 $.\n\nBut let’s test $ Z = \\frac{1}{3} $: then $ X = 15 $ satisfies $ |15 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}| = 5 \\le 5 $, equality holds.\n\nGreatest integer — so 15 is allowed.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer one over another?\n\nWait, rereading: “Let $ X $ be the greatest integer such that $ |X Z| \\le r + \\frac{9}{2} $”.\n\nSince $ r + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{9}{2} = 5 $, and inequality is ≤, so maximum $ X $ occurs when $ Z $ is minimal positive value. But $ Z $ is fixed by problem 15.\n\nPerhaps in problem 15, $ Z = 1 $. Why? Because often $ Z $ denotes a partition function or normalizing constant — but here total probability sums to 1, so $ Z = 1 $.\n\nIn statistical mechanics, $ Z $ is partition function, but here it's probability distribution already normalized.\n\nGiven ambiguity, and that the problem is likely designed to have a unique answer, and $ r = \\frac{1}{2} $ is solid, and $ r + \\frac{9}{2} = 5 $, the most natural assumption is $ Z = 1 $, yielding $ X = 5 $.\n\nMoreover, 5 is small, clean, and matches the bound exactly.\n\nThus I’ll go with $ X = 5 $.\n\nFinal answer: 5.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The stationary distribution satisfies a recurrence for |n| ≥ 2: 2π_{n+1} − 5π_n + 2π_{n−1} = 0, whose characteristic equation 2r² − 5r + 2 = 0 has roots r = 2 and r = 1/2. Since probabilities must decay as |n| increases, r = 1/2 is selected, giving π_{n+1}/π_n = 1/2 for n ≥ 1. Thus r = 1/2. Then r + 9/2 = 1/2 + 9/2 = 5.
