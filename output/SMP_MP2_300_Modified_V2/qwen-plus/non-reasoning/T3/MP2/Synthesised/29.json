  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-step problem involving combinatorics and polynomial interpolation.\n\nLet’s break it down carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the cube assembly problem\n\nWe have **8 unit cubes of different colors**, to be assembled into a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ cube (i.e., 8 positions, one for each cube). Since all cubes are distinct (different colors), the total number of labelings (assignments of cubes to positions) is $8! = 40320$, *if* positions were labeled (i.e., fixed in space).\n\nBut rotations are considered the same — i.e., two colorings that can be rotated into each other are not distinct. Reflections *are* considered distinct (so we don’t identify mirror images).\n\nSo the number of distinct cubes up to rotation is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{8!}{|G|}\n$$\n\nwhere $G$ is the rotation group of the cube. The rotation group of the cube (proper rotations, excluding reflections) has order **24**.\n\nSo number of distinct cubes up to rotation = $ \\frac{40320}{24} = 1680 $.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\n> Instead of determining the number of distinct cubes up to rotations, simply find $k = m - 34$, where $m$ is the number of ways to choose which of the remaining cubes occupy the positions adjacent to the fixed cube, derived from the analysis of fixing one cube's position to account for rotational symmetry.\n\nSo they want us to fix one cube in a particular position to eliminate rotational symmetry, then count how many ways to assign the remaining cubes to positions *adjacent* to it — that count is $m$, and then $k = m - 34$.\n\nLet’s interpret “fixing one cube’s position to account for rotational symmetry”.\n\nStandard technique: To eliminate rotational symmetry, fix one colored cube at a particular position — say, the “bottom-front-left” corner (a specific position). Since all cubes are distinct, we can fix *which* cube goes there — but actually, to account for symmetry, we fix the *position*, not the cube.\n\nWait — standard Burnside / orbit-stabilizer: number of orbits = total / |G| = 40320 / 24 = 1680.\n\nAlternatively, fix one cube (say, the red cube) at a particular position — since rotations act transitively on positions, we can rotate any configuration so that red cube is at a chosen position (e.g., position (0,0,0)). Then the remaining 7 cubes go into the other 7 positions — but now, because we’ve fixed the position of one cube, we’ve eliminated all rotational symmetry? Not quite — some rotations may fix that position.\n\nWhich rotations fix a given corner? Only the identity and possibly some others?\n\nLet’s consider: In a cube, the stabilizer of a corner under the rotation group.\n\nThe rotation group acts on the 8 corners. Since group order is 24 and number of corners is 8, by orbit-stabilizer:\n\n- Orbit size of a corner = 8 ⇒ stabilizer size = 24 / 8 = **3**.\n\nIndeed, the three rotations that fix a given corner are: identity, 120° rotation about the space diagonal through that corner and opposite corner, and 240° rotation.\n\nSo if we fix a particular cube (say, cube A) at a particular corner, then the remaining cubes can be placed in the other 7 positions in $7!$ ways, but we must divide by the size of the stabilizer of that corner (since those 3 rotations preserve that corner and permute the other positions). So number of distinct configurations with cube A fixed at that corner is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{7!}{3} = \\frac{5040}{3} = 1680\n$$\n\nWait — that matches the earlier total number of distinct cubes! That makes sense: fixing one labeled cube at a corner accounts for all symmetries except those that fix that corner — so dividing by stabilizer gives correct count.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\n> $m$ is the number of ways to choose which of the remaining cubes occupy the positions **adjacent to the fixed cube**, derived from the analysis of fixing one cube's position...\n\nSo now: fix one cube at a corner. How many positions are *adjacent* to that corner?\n\nIn a $2\\times2\\times2$ cube, each corner (unit cube) is adjacent (sharing a face) to **3 other unit cubes**, because a corner cube has neighbors along x, y, z directions — each direction has one neighbor (since size is 2). So degree = 3.\n\nSo among the 7 remaining positions, exactly **3 are face-adjacent** to the fixed corner cube.\n\nSo “positions adjacent to the fixed cube” = 3 positions.\n\nWe need to count number of ways to choose which of the remaining 7 cubes go into those 3 adjacent positions.\n\nThat would be: choose 3 cubes out of remaining 7, assign them to the 3 adjacent positions: i.e., number of injective assignments = $P(7,3) = 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 = 210$.\n\nBut wait — does the problem say “choose which of the remaining cubes occupy the positions adjacent”, i.e., just selection (not assignment)? Or assignment?\n\nIt says “occupy the positions”, plural, and “positions adjacent” — there are 3 positions, each gets a cube, all distinct, so it's permutations: $7 \\times 6 \\times 5 = 210$.\n\nThen $m = 210$, so $k = m - 34 = 210 - 34 = 176$.\n\nBut let’s verify if this interpretation is correct.\n\nAlternative interpretation: maybe after fixing one cube at a corner, we consider only the 3 adjacent positions, and count how many ways to assign cubes there — yes, that’s $P(7,3)=210$. So $k = 176$.\n\nHold onto that: $k = 176$.\n\nBut let’s double-check whether “adjacent” means face-adjacent only — yes, in grid terms, adjacency usually means sharing a face; in $2\\times2\\times2$, each corner cube touches exactly 3 others via faces — correct.\n\nSo $m = 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 = 210$, $k = 210 - 34 = 176$.\n\nSo $k = 176$.\n\nNow proceed.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Polynomial $P(x) = x^4 - (k + 28)x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c$\n\nGiven:\n- $P(5) = k + 10$\n- $P(11) = k + 16$\n- $P(17) = k + 22$\n\nWe are to find the **sum of the coefficients** of $P(x)$.\n\nRecall: sum of coefficients of a polynomial $P(x)$ is $P(1)$.\n\nSo we need to compute $P(1)$.\n\nWe know $P(x)$ is degree 4, monic, with known leading coefficient 1 and coefficient of $x^3$ equal to $-(k+28)$. Coefficients $a,b,c$ are unknown.\n\nWe’re given values at three points: $x = 5, 11, 17$, and we know the form of $P(x)$. Since it's degree 4, and we have only 3 conditions, but also structure: perhaps define a new polynomial to exploit pattern.\n\nObserve the inputs: 5, 11, 17 — arithmetic progression with difference 6.\n\nOutputs: $k+10$, $k+16$, $k+22$ — also arithmetic progression with difference 6.\n\nSo $P(x)$ increases linearly over these 3 points? But $P(x)$ is quartic — however, maybe $P(x) - (x + (k+5))$ has roots? Let's see:\n\nAt $x = 5$: $P(5) = k + 10 = (5) + (k + 5)$ → $P(5) = 5 + k + 5 = k + 10$ ✓  \nAt $x = 11$: $P(11) = k + 16 = 11 + k + 5 = k + 16$ ✓  \nAt $x = 17$: $P(17) = k + 22 = 17 + k + 5 = k + 22$ ✓  \n\nSo $P(x) = x + k + 5$ at $x = 5, 11, 17$.\n\nThus, the polynomial $Q(x) = P(x) - (x + k + 5)$ has roots at $x = 5, 11, 17$.\n\nSo $Q(x)$ is degree 4 (since $P$ is degree 4, subtracting linear doesn’t reduce degree), and has at least three known roots. So we can write:\n\n$$\nQ(x) = (x - 5)(x - 11)(x - 17)(dx + e)\n$$\n\nBecause it's degree 4, and we factor out the cubic, left with linear factor.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nP(x) = (x - 5)(x - 11)(x - 17)(dx + e) + x + k + 5\n$$\n\nAlso, we know the expansion of $P(x)$ starts with $x^4 - (k + 28)x^3 + \\dots$\n\nLet’s expand the leading terms of RHS.\n\nFirst, $(x - 5)(x - 11)(x - 17)$ is a monic cubic:\n\nCompute:\n\n$(x - 5)(x - 11) = x^2 - 16x + 55$\n\nMultiply by $(x - 17)$:\n\n$(x^2 - 16x + 55)(x - 17) = x^3 - 17x^2 -16x^2 + 272x + 55x - 935 = x^3 - 33x^2 + 327x - 935$\n\nCheck:\n\n- $x^2 \\cdot x = x^3$\n- $x^2 \\cdot (-17) = -17x^2$\n- $-16x \\cdot x = -16x^2$ → total $-33x^2$\n- $-16x \\cdot (-17) = +272x$\n- $55 \\cdot x = 55x$ → total $327x$\n- $55 \\cdot (-17) = -935$\n\nYes.\n\nSo $(x - 5)(x - 11)(x - 17) = x^3 - 33x^2 + 327x - 935$\n\nNow multiply by $(dx + e)$:\n\n$(x^3 - 33x^2 + 327x - 935)(dx + e) =$\n\n- $dx^4 + ex^3$\n- $-33d x^3 -33e x^2$\n- $+327d x^2 + 327e x$\n- $-935d x - 935e$\n\nCollect terms:\n\n- $x^4$: $d$\n- $x^3$: $e - 33d$\n- $x^2$: $-33e + 327d$\n- $x^1$: $327e - 935d$\n- constant: $-935e$\n\nThen add $x + k + 5$:\n\nSo full $P(x) =$\n\n- $x^4$: $d$\n- $x^3$: $e - 33d$\n- $x^2$: $-33e + 327d$\n- $x^1$: $327e - 935d + 1$\n- constant: $-935e + k + 5$\n\nBut we are told $P(x) = x^4 - (k + 28)x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c$, i.e., leading coefficient is 1 ⇒ $d = 1$\n\nSo $d = 1$\n\nThen:\n\n- Coefficient of $x^3$: $e - 33(1) = e - 33$\n\nBut this must equal $-(k + 28)$, so:\n\n$$\ne - 33 = -(k + 28) \\Rightarrow e = -k - 28 + 33 = -k + 5\n$$\n\nSo $e = 5 - k$\n\nNow we have $d = 1$, $e = 5 - k$\n\nNow compute $P(1)$, the sum of coefficients.\n\nWe can compute $P(1)$ using the expression:\n\n$$\nP(x) = (x - 5)(x - 11)(x - 17)(x + e) + x + k + 5 \\quad \\text{(since } d = 1\\text{)}\n$$\n\nWait: $(dx + e) = x + e$, yes.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nP(1) = (1 - 5)(1 - 11)(1 - 17)(1 + e) + 1 + k + 5\n$$\n\nCompute:\n\n- $1 - 5 = -4$\n- $1 - 11 = -10$\n- $1 - 17 = -16$\n\nProduct: $(-4)(-10)(-16) = (40)(-16) = -640$\n\nThen $(1 + e) = 1 + (5 - k) = 6 - k$\n\nSo first term: $-640 \\cdot (6 - k) = -640(6 - k) = -3840 + 640k$\n\nThen add $1 + k + 5 = k + 6$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nP(1) = (-3840 + 640k) + (k + 6) = 641k - 3834\n$$\n\nNow recall $k = 176$\n\nCompute:\n\n$641 \\times 176$\n\nBreak it down:\n\n- $641 \\times 100 = 64100$\n- $641 \\times 70 = 641 \\times 7 \\times 10 = 4487 \\times 10 = 44870$\n- $641 \\times 6 = 3846$\n\nSo $641 \\times 176 = 641 \\times (100 + 70 + 6) = 64100 + 44870 + 3846 = $\n\n64100 + 44870 = 108970  \n108970 + 3846 = 112816\n\nThen $P(1) = 112816 - 3834 = 108982$\n\nWait: 112816 − 3834:\n\n112816 − 3000 = 109816  \n109816 − 834 = 108982 ✓\n\nSo sum of coefficients = $P(1) = 108982$\n\nBut let’s verify calculations step-by-step to avoid arithmetic error.\n\nFirst, confirm $k = 176$:\n\n- Fix one cube at a corner.\n- Adjacent positions: 3.\n- Remaining cubes: 7 distinct.\n- Number of ways to assign cubes to those 3 positions: $7 \\times 6 \\times 5 = 210$. Yes.\n- $m = 210$, $k = m - 34 = 176$. Correct.\n\nNow $e = 5 - k = 5 - 176 = -171$\n\nThen $1 + e = 1 - 171 = -170$\n\nEarlier I said $1 + e = 6 - k$, but $e = 5 - k$, so $1 + e = 1 + 5 - k = 6 - k$. Yes, and $6 - 176 = -170$. Correct.\n\nThen $(1 - 5)(1 - 11)(1 - 17) = (-4)(-10)(-16)$\n\n- $(-4)(-10) = 40$\n- $40 \\times (-16) = -640$. Correct.\n\nSo first term: $-640 \\times (6 - k) = -640 \\times (-170) = +640 \\times 170$\n\nCompute $640 \\times 170$:\n\n- $640 \\times 100 = 64000$\n- $640 \\times 70 = 44800$\n- Total = 64000 + 44800 = 108800\n\nWait! Earlier I computed $-640 \\times (6 - k) = -640 \\times (-170) = +108800$, not $-3840 + 640k$. Let's recast.\n\nActually:\n\n$-640 \\times (6 - k) = -640 \\times 6 + 640 \\times k = -3840 + 640k$. Yes, same.\n\nBut with $k = 176$: $640 \\times 176 = ?$\n\nCompute $640 \\times 176$:\n\n- $640 \\times 100 = 64000$\n- $640 \\times 70 = 44800$\n- $640 \\times 6 = 3840$\n- Sum: $64000 + 44800 = 108800$; $108800 + 3840 = 112640$\n\nWait — earlier I had $641 \\times 176 = 112816$, but here it's $640 \\times 176$.\n\nYes! Mistake above: I used $641k$, but it's $640k$.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n$P(1) = -640(6 - k) + k + 6 = -3840 + 640k + k + 6 = 641k - 3834$. Yes, that part is correct: because $-640(6 - k) = -3840 + 640k$, then adding $k + 6$ gives $641k - 3834$. So that derivation is fine.\n\nNow compute $641 \\times 176$ accurately.\n\nDo $641 \\times 176$:\n\nUse multiplication:\n\n```\n    641\n  × 176\n  -----\n   3846   ← 641 × 6\n  4487    ← 641 × 70 (shifted left by 1) = 641×7=4487, then ×10 → 44870? Wait no — careful.\n\nActually:\n\n176 = 100 + 70 + 6\n\n641 × 100 = 64100  \n641 × 70 = 641 × 7 × 10 = (641×7) × 10\n\n641 × 7: 600×7=4200, 40×7=280, 1×7=7 → 4200+280+7 = 4487 → ×10 = 44870  \n641 × 6 = 3846  \n\nNow sum: 64100 + 44870 = 108970; 108970 + 3846 = 112816. Correct.\n\nThen $641k - 3834 = 112816 - 3834$\n\n112816 − 3834:\n\n112816 − 3000 = 109816  \n109816 − 834 = 108982. Yes.\n\nBut let’s verify via alternate route: compute $P(1)$ directly using numbers.\n\nWe have:\n\n- $d = 1$\n- $e = 5 - k = 5 - 176 = -171$\n\nSo $P(x) = (x-5)(x-11)(x-17)(x - 171) + x + k + 5$\n\nWait no: $(dx + e) = x + e = x - 171$\n\nSo at $x = 1$: $(1-5)(1-11)(1-17)(1 - 171) + 1 + 176 + 5$\n\n= $(-4)(-10)(-16)(-170) + 182$\n\nNow compute product:\n\n- $(-4)(-10) = 40$\n- $(-16)(-170) = 2720$\n- Then $40 × 2720 = ?$\n\n$40 × 2720 = 2720 × 4 × 10 = 10880 × 10 = 108800$\n\nYes! So first term = $108800$\n\nThen add $1 + k + 5 = 1 + 176 + 5 = 182$\n\nSo $P(1) = 108800 + 182 = 108982$\n\nSame result.\n\nSo sum of coefficients = **108982**\n\nThus answer is 108982.\n\nBut wait — the problem says “Find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial $P(x)=x^{4}-(k + 28) x^{3}+a x^{2}+b x+c$”, and we found it.\n\nAll steps check out.\n\nSo final answer is 108982.\n\n---\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We first determine k by analyzing the cube assembly. Fixing one cube at a corner of the 2×2×2 cube leaves 7 distinct cubes to assign to the remaining positions. Exactly 3 positions are face-adjacent to the fixed corner. The number of ways to assign 3 distinct cubes to these positions is P(7,3) = 7×6×5 = 210, so m = 210. Thus k = m − 34 = 210 − 34 = 176. Next, we consider the polynomial P(x) = x⁴ − (k + 28)x³ + ax² + bx + c. Given P(5) = k + 10, P(11) = k + 16, P(17) = k + 22, we observe that P(x) − (x + k + 5) has roots at x = 5, 11, 17. Hence P(x) = (x−5)(x−11)(x−17)(dx + e) + x + k + 5. Since P(x) is monic quartic, d = 1. Matching the x³ coefficient gives e = 5 − k = −171. Evaluating P(1) yields (1−5)(1−11)(1−17)(1 + e) + 1 + k + 5 = (−4)(−10)(−16)(−170) + 182 = 108800 + 182 = 108982.
