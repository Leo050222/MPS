  "math_problem": "How many ways, without taking order into consideration, can 2002 be expressed as the sum of 3 positive integers (for instance, $1000+1000+2$ and $1000+2+1000$ are considered to be the same way)? Instead of determining the total number of unordered triples of positive integers that sum to the given total, simply find $l$, the terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends. Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer with exactly $(l + 2012)$ positive factors. What is the sum of the (not necessarily distinct) prime factors of $n$?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-step problem. Let's break it down carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the first part — counting unordered triples of positive integers summing to 2002**\n\nWe want the number of unordered triples $(a, b, c)$ of **positive integers**, with $a \\le b \\le c$, such that:\n\n$$\na + b + c = 2002\n$$\n\nBut the problem says:\n\n> Instead of determining the total number of unordered triples... simply find $l$, the terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends.\n\nSo we don’t need the full count — just $l$, defined as the *terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence* that arises when enumerating possible **middle addends**, i.e., values of $b$ (since in $a \\le b \\le c$, $b$ is the middle one).\n\nLet’s analyze how $b$ can vary.\n\nGiven $a \\le b \\le c$, and all positive integers, and $a + b + c = 2002$.\n\nSince $a \\le b \\le c$, then:\n- Minimum $a$ is 1.\n- Since $a \\le b$, and $c = 2002 - a - b \\ge b$, so:\n\n$$\n2002 - a - b \\ge b \\implies 2002 - a \\ge 2b \\implies b \\le \\frac{2002 - a}{2}\n$$\n\nAlso, since $a \\le b$, we have $a \\le b$. So for fixed $b$, what are possible $a$?\n\nFrom $a \\le b$ and $c = 2002 - a - b \\ge b$, we get:\n\n$$\n2002 - a - b \\ge b \\implies a \\le 2002 - 2b\n$$\n\nAlso $a \\ge 1$, and $a \\le b$, so combining:\n\n$$\n1 \\le a \\le \\min(b,\\; 2002 - 2b)\n$$\n\nFor this interval to be nonempty, need:\n\n$$\n\\min(b,\\; 2002 - 2b) \\ge 1 \\implies \n\\begin{cases}\nb \\ge 1 \\\\\n2002 - 2b \\ge 1 \\implies b \\le 1000.5 \\implies b \\le 1000\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAlso, since $a \\le b$ and $a \\le 2002 - 2b$, to have at least one $a$, need:\n\n$$\n\\text{lower bound } \\le \\text{upper bound} \\implies 1 \\le \\min(b, 2002 - 2b)\n$$\n\nSo both $b \\ge 1$ and $2002 - 2b \\ge 1 \\implies b \\le 1000$\n\nAlso, since $a \\le b$, and $a \\le 2002 - 2b$, the tighter upper bound on $a$ is $\\min(b, 2002 - 2b)$. So for different ranges of $b$, which one is smaller?\n\n- When is $b \\le 2002 - 2b$?  \n  $b \\le 2002 - 2b \\implies 3b \\le 2002 \\implies b \\le \\lfloor 2002/3 \\rfloor = 667$ (since $3 \\times 667 = 2001$, $3 \\times 668 = 2004 > 2002$)\n\nSo:\n\n- For $b \\le 667$: $\\min(b, 2002 - 2b) = b$, so $a$ can range from $1$ to $b$, but also must satisfy $c = 2002 - a - b \\ge b$, i.e., $a \\le 2002 - 2b$. Wait — contradiction? Let's double-check.\n\nHold on — earlier we derived $a \\le 2002 - 2b$ from $c \\ge b$. That inequality must hold regardless. So even if $b \\le 667$, we still require $a \\le 2002 - 2b$. But if $b \\le 667$, then $2002 - 2b \\ge 2002 - 1334 = 668$, and $b \\le 667$, so $2002 - 2b > b$. So indeed, for $b \\le 667$, the binding constraint is $a \\le b$, but wait — no! Let's re-derive carefully.\n\nWe have:\n\n- $a \\le b \\le c$\n- $a + b + c = 2002$\n- So $c = 2002 - a - b \\ge b \\implies a \\le 2002 - 2b$ — this is necessary.\n- Also $a \\le b$ — also necessary.\n- And $a \\ge 1$\n\nSo overall, for a given $b$, valid $a$ must satisfy:\n\n$$\n1 \\le a \\le \\min(b,\\; 2002 - 2b)\n$$\n\nSo number of $a$'s is $\\max\\left(0,\\; \\min(b,\\; 2002 - 2b) \\right)$\n\nThus, for $b$ such that $\\min(b, 2002 - 2b) \\ge 1$, i.e., $b \\ge 1$ and $2002 - 2b \\ge 1 \\implies b \\le 1000$, and also $b \\le 2002 - 2b \\iff b \\le 667.\\overline{3}$, so:\n\n- For $1 \\le b \\le 667$: $\\min = b$, so $a = 1$ to $b$: $b$ choices? Wait no — $a$ must also satisfy $c = 2002 - a - b \\ge b$, i.e., $a \\le 2002 - 2b$. But if $b \\le 667$, then $2002 - 2b \\ge 668 > b$, so $a \\le b$ is less restrictive → so $a$ can be $1$ to $b$, **but** does each such $a$ give $c \\ge b$? Let's test with $b = 1$: then $a \\le 1$, so $a = 1$, then $c = 2002 - 1 - 1 = 2000 \\ge 1$: OK. So yes.\n\nBut wait — if $a = b = 1$, then $c = 2000$, fine.\n\nBut what about $b = 667$: then $2002 - 2b = 2002 - 1334 = 668$, so $a \\le \\min(667, 668) = 667$, so $a = 1$ to $667$. Then $c = 2002 - a - 667 = 1335 - a$. Since $a \\le 667$, $c \\ge 1335 - 667 = 668 \\ge b = 667$: OK.\n\nNow for $b = 668$: then $2002 - 2b = 2002 - 1336 = 666$, and $b = 668$, so $\\min = 666$. So $a = 1$ to $666$. Also need $a \\le b = 668$: OK. So $a$ up to 666.\n\nSo for $b$ from $668$ to $1000$, the upper bound is $2002 - 2b$, decreasing.\n\nSo the number of $a$'s for each $b$ is:\n\n- For $b = 1$ to $667$: $a = 1$ to $b$ → $b$ values\n- For $b = 668$ to $1000$: $a = 1$ to $2002 - 2b$ → $2002 - 2b$ values\n\nSo the \"case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends\" splits at $b = 667$ and $b = 668$, and yields two arithmetic sequences:\n\n- First sequence: $b = 1$ to $667$: number of solutions for each $b$ is $b$: so counts are $1, 2, 3, ..., 667$ → arithmetic sequence with first term 1, last term 667, common difference 1.\n\n- Second sequence: $b = 668$ to $1000$: number of solutions is $2002 - 2b$. Let's compute values:\n\nAt $b = 668$: $2002 - 2*668 = 2002 - 1336 = 666$  \nAt $b = 669$: $2002 - 1338 = 664$  \nSo it's decreasing by 2 each time: $666, 664, 662, ..., ?$\n\nWhat is the last $b$? $b_{\\max} = 1000$: $2002 - 2*1000 = 2002 - 2000 = 2$\n\nSo sequence is: $666, 664, ..., 2$: an arithmetic sequence with first term 666, common difference $-2$, last term 2.\n\nHow many terms? From 2 to 666 step 2: number of terms = $\\frac{666 - 2}{2} + 1 = \\frac{664}{2} + 1 = 332 + 1 = 333$\n\nCheck: $b$ from 668 to 1000 inclusive: $1000 - 668 + 1 = 333$: matches.\n\nSo second arithmetic sequence: terms are $2002 - 2b$ for $b = 668$ to $1000$: values $666, 664, ..., 2$. So it's an arithmetic sequence with **terminal term** $l = 2$.\n\nThe problem says: *\"find $l$, the terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends.\"*\n\nWe have two arithmetic sequences:\n\n- First: $1, 2, ..., 667$: length 667, terminal term 667  \n- Second: $666, 664, ..., 2$: length 333, terminal term 2  \n\nWhich is shorter? 333 < 667 ⇒ second is shorter ⇒ its terminal term is $l = 2$\n\n✅ So $l = 2$\n\nWait — but let's double-check wording: “shorter arithmetic sequence” — could refer to length or number of terms? Yes, length in terms of count of elements.\n\nSo shorter one has 333 terms, ends at 2 ⇒ $l = 2$\n\nHold on — is there any chance they mean the *sequence of $b$ values*, not the sequence of counts?\n\nLet’s reread: “the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends”.\n\n“Middle addends” = possible values of $b$. In case analysis, we split $b$ into two ranges: $1$ to $667$, and $668$ to $1000$. Are these arithmetic sequences? Yes — both are consecutive integers, so arithmetic sequences with difference 1.\n\n- First: $b = 1, 2, ..., 667$: length 667, terminal term 667  \n- Second: $b = 668, 669, ..., 1000$: length $1000 - 668 + 1 = 333$, terminal term 1000\n\nSo shorter sequence of $b$’s is $668$ to $1000$: length 333, terminal term $1000$\n\nThat would make $l = 1000$\n\nWhich interpretation is correct?\n\nThe phrase: “arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends”\n\nThe case analysis splits the domain of possible $b$ into two intervals — that’s natural. The “possible middle addends” are the $b$’s, so the sequences are the ranges of $b$. So the two arithmetic sequences are the sets of $b$ values in each case: $[1,667]$ and $[668,1000]$, both arithmetic (consecutive integers). Their lengths are 667 and 333 ⇒ shorter is second, terminal term is $1000$\n\nThat seems more plausible — because “enumerating the possible middle addends” means listing possible $b$, not the number of $a$ for each $b$.\n\nAlso, the problem says “the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis”, and case analysis naturally partitions the domain of $b$.\n\nMoreover, the first sequence goes up to $ \\lfloor 2002/3 \\rfloor = 667 $, and second from $668$ to $\\lfloor (2002-1)/2 \\rfloor = 1000$ (since $a \\ge 1$, $c \\ge b$ ⇒ $a + b + c = 2002$, $c \\ge b$, $a \\ge 1$ ⇒ $1 + b + b \\le 2002 \\Rightarrow 2b \\le 2001 \\Rightarrow b \\le 1000$)\n\nYes, $b_{\\max} = 1000$, because minimal $a=1$, and $c \\ge b$, so $1 + b + b \\le 2002 \\Rightarrow b \\le 1000.5 \\Rightarrow b \\le 1000$\n\nSo $b$ ranges from $1$ to $1000$, split at $667$ and $668$. So sequences:\n\n- $b = 1$ to $667$: length 667  \n- $b = 668$ to $1000$: length $1000 - 668 + 1 = 333$\n\nSo shorter arithmetic sequence of $b$’s is $668, 669, ..., 1000$, which is arithmetic with difference 1, first term 668, last term $l = 1000$\n\nHence $l = 1000$\n\nThis feels right.\n\nLet’s verify with small analog: say sum = 9. How many unordered triples of positive integers sum to 9?\n\nList: $a \\le b \\le c$, $a+b+c = 9$\n\nPossible:\n\n- $a=1$: then $b+c = 8$, $b \\le c$, $b \\ge a = 1$, and $b \\le c = 8-b \\Rightarrow b \\le 4$. So $b = 1$ to $4$, but also $b \\ge a = 1$, and $b \\le c \\Rightarrow b \\le 4$. Also need $b \\ge a = 1$, and since $a \\le b$, ok. But also $b \\le c = 8 - b \\Rightarrow b \\le 4$. So $b = 1$ to $4$, but must have $b \\le c$ and $a \\le b$: so $b = 1,2,3,4$\n\nBut check each:\n\n- $b = 1$: $c = 7$, triple $(1,1,7)$ — OK  \n- $b = 2$: $c = 6$, $(1,2,6)$  \n- $b = 3$: $c = 5$, $(1,3,5)$  \n- $b = 4$: $c = 4$, $(1,4,4)$\n\n- $a = 2$: then $b + c = 7$, $b \\ge 2$, $c \\ge b$, so $b \\le c = 7-b \\Rightarrow b \\le 3.5 \\Rightarrow b \\le 3$. So $b = 2,3$\n\n- $b = 2$: $c = 5$, $(2,2,5)$  \n- $b = 3$: $c = 4$, $(2,3,4)$\n\n- $a = 3$: $b + c = 6$, $b \\ge 3$, $c \\ge b$, so $b \\le 3$ (since $b \\le c = 6-b \\Rightarrow 2b \\le 6 \\Rightarrow b \\le 3$), so $b = 3$, $c = 3$: $(3,3,3)$\n\nTotal: 7 triples.\n\nNow, what are possible $b$ (middle values)? List $b$ in each triple:\n\n- $(1,1,7)$: $b = 1$  \n- $(1,2,6)$: $b = 2$  \n- $(1,3,5)$: $b = 3$  \n- $(1,4,4)$: $b = 4$  \n- $(2,2,5)$: $b = 2$  \n- $(2,3,4)$: $b = 3$  \n- $(3,3,3)$: $b = 3$\n\nSo $b$ takes values: 1,2,3,4 — but not all $b$ in range appear as middle in *some* triple? Actually, for sum $S = 9$, max $b$ occurs when $a = b$, $c \\ge b$: $a + b + c = 9$, $a = b$, $c \\ge b$ ⇒ $2b + c = 9$, $c \\ge b$ ⇒ $2b + b \\le 9 \\Rightarrow b \\le 3$. Wait, but we have $b = 4$ in $(1,4,4)$. Here $a = 1$, $b = 4$, $c = 4$, so $a < b = c$. So $b$ can be larger.\n\nGeneral bounds for $b$: since $a \\le b \\le c$, and $a \\ge 1$, $c \\ge b$, then:\n\n- Minimal $b$: when $a = b = c$ ⇒ $3b = 9 \\Rightarrow b = 3$? No — minimal $b$ is when $a$ is minimal and $c$ maximal, e.g., $(1,1,7)$ gives $b = 1$. So $b_{\\min} = 1$\n\n- Max $b$: when $a$ is minimal ($1$) and $b = c$: then $1 + b + b = 9 \\Rightarrow 2b = 8 \\Rightarrow b = 4$. So $b_{\\max} = 4$\n\nSo $b$ ranges from $1$ to $4$. Split point? When does the constraint switch from $a \\le b$ being binding vs $c \\ge b$? As before: $a \\le b$ and $a \\le S - 2b$. So $\\min(b, S - 2b)$. Set equal: $b = S - 2b \\Rightarrow 3b = S \\Rightarrow b = S/3$. For $S = 9$, $b = 3$. So:\n\n- $b = 1,2,3$: $\\min = b$  \n- $b = 4$: $\\min = S - 2b = 9 - 8 = 1$, so $a = 1$ only.\n\nSo $b$ ranges $1$ to $\\lfloor (S-1)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 8/2 \\rfloor = 4$, split at $\\lfloor S/3 \\rfloor = 3$. So sequences: $b = 1$ to $3$ (length 3), and $b = 4$ (length 1). Shorter is $b = 4$, terminal term $l = 4$\n\nIndeed, for $S = 9$, $l = 4 = \\lfloor (S-1)/2 \\rfloor$\n\nIn general, for sum $S$, $b_{\\max} = \\lfloor (S-1)/2 \\rfloor$, because $a \\ge 1$, $c \\ge b$, so $1 + b + b \\le S \\Rightarrow 2b \\le S - 1 \\Rightarrow b \\le \\lfloor (S-1)/2 \\rfloor$\n\nFor $S = 2002$: $b_{\\max} = \\lfloor 2001/2 \\rfloor = 1000$\n\nAnd split point is at $\\lfloor S/3 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2002/3 \\rfloor = 667$, since $3 \\times 667 = 2001$, $3 \\times 668 = 2004 > 2002$\n\nSo $b$ ranges:\n\n- Case 1: $b = 1$ to $667$: length $667$  \n- Case 2: $b = 668$ to $1000$: length $1000 - 668 + 1 = 333$\n\nSo shorter arithmetic sequence is the second, with terminal term $l = 1000$\n\n✅ So $l = 1000$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer with exactly $(l + 2012)$ positive factors**\n\nWe have $l = 1000$, so $l + 2012 = 1000 + 2012 = 3012$\n\nSo $n$ is the smallest positive integer with exactly **3012 positive divisors**.\n\nWe need to find the sum of the (not necessarily distinct) prime factors of $n$.\n\nThat is, if $n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\dots p_k^{e_k}$, then sum of prime factors *with multiplicity* = $e_1 \\cdot p_1 + e_2 \\cdot p_2 + \\dots + e_k \\cdot p_k$? Wait — no.\n\n\"Sum of the (not necessarily distinct) prime factors\" usually means sum of primes in the prime factorization, counting multiplicity. For example, $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$, prime factors with multiplicity: $2, 2, 3$, sum = $2+2+3 = 7$\n\nYes, that's standard: \"sum of prime factors with multiplicity\" = integer's *integer logarithm* or SOPF with multiplicity.\n\nSo for $n = \\prod p_i^{e_i}$, sum = $\\sum e_i p_i$\n\nWe need to find minimal $n$ with $d(n) = 3012$, then compute $\\sum e_i p_i$\n\nSo first, factor $3012$\n\nCompute prime factorization of $3012$:\n\n- Even: $3012 / 2 = 1506$  \n- $1506 / 2 = 753$  \n- $753$: sum digits $7+5+3 = 15$, divisible by 3: $753 / 3 = 251$  \n- $251$ is prime? Check divisibility: not even, not divisible by 3 ($2+5+1 = 8$), not by 5, 7: $7*35 = 245$, $251-245 = 6$, not divisible, 11: $11*22 = 242$, $251-242 = 9$, no, 13: $13*19 = 247$, $251-247 = 4$, 17: $17*14 = 238$, $251-238 = 13$, 19: $19*13 = 247$, same. So 251 is prime.\n\nSo $3012 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 251$\n\nSo $d(n) = 3012 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 251$\n\nRecall: if $n = \\prod p_i^{e_i}$, then $d(n) = \\prod (e_i + 1)$\n\nSo we need to write $3012$ as a product of integers $> 1$, each corresponding to $(e_i + 1)$, and assign them to primes in increasing order (to minimize $n$), with exponents in decreasing order (since smaller primes should get larger exponents).\n\nStandard method to minimize $n$ given $d(n) = k$: factor $k$ into integers $> 1$, subtract 1 to get exponents $e_i$, sort exponents in decreasing order, assign to smallest primes.\n\nSo factor $3012$ into factors $> 1$, as many as possible? No — to minimize $n = \\prod p_i^{e_i}$, we want:\n\n- Smaller primes raised to larger exponents.\n\nSo best is to write $3012$ as product of integers $(e_i + 1)$, sorted in decreasing order, then assign largest exponent to smallest prime.\n\nSo first, find all ways to write $3012$ as product of integers $\\ge 2$, then for each, sort the $(e_i + 1)$ in decreasing order, set $e_i = f_i - 1$, sort $e_i$ decreasing, assign to primes $2,3,5,\\dots$\n\nThen compute $n$, pick smallest.\n\nSince $3012$ has large prime factor $251$, likely the optimal factorization is $3012 = 251 \\times 12$, or $251 \\times 6 \\times 2$, etc.\n\nNote: $251$ is large, so $e_i + 1 = 251 \\Rightarrow e_i = 250$, which would mean a prime raised to 250th power — huge. But maybe unavoidable? Let's see alternatives.\n\nCan we write $3012$ as product without using 251? No, because 251 is prime factor, so any factorization must include 251 or a multiple, but since it's prime, one of the $(e_i + 1)$ must be divisible by 251, so minimal is $e_i + 1 = 251$, so $e_i = 250$\n\nThus, any $n$ with $d(n) = 3012$ must have some prime factor with exponent $250$, since 251 is prime.\n\nSo minimal $n$ will assign exponent $250$ to the smallest prime, i.e., $2^{250}$, and then handle the remaining factor $3012 / 251 = 12$\n\nBecause $3012 = 251 \\times 12$, and $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$\n\nSo remaining divisor count factor is $12$, which can be written as:\n\n- $12 = 12$ → one more exponent: $e_2 + 1 = 12 \\Rightarrow e_2 = 11$, assign to next prime $3^{11}$\n\n- Or $12 = 6 \\times 2$ → exponents $5$ and $1$, assign to $3^5 \\cdot 5^1$\n\n- Or $12 = 4 \\times 3$ → $3^3 \\cdot 5^2$? Wait, exponents are $e_i = f_i - 1$, so $f_i = 4,3$ → $e_i = 3,2$, so $3^3 \\cdot 5^2$\n\n- Or $12 = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2$ → exponents $2,1,1$ → $3^2 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 7^1$\n\n- Or $12 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3$ same.\n\nTo minimize $n = 2^{250} \\times \\text{(other part)}$, we need to minimize the other part.\n\nCompare options:\n\n- $3^{11}$: $3^{11} = 177147$\n\n- $3^5 \\cdot 5^1 = 243 \\cdot 5 = 1215$\n\n- $3^3 \\cdot 5^2 = 27 \\cdot 25 = 675$\n\n- $3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 315$\n\n- $3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11$? That would require $12 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 1$ — no, all $f_i \\ge 2$, so minimum $f_i = 2$, so max number of factors is number of 2s in factorization. $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$, so can do $2 \\times 2 \\times 3$ → three factors → exponents $1,1,2$ → sorted decreasing: $2,1,1$, assign to $3^2, 5^1, 7^1 = 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 315$\n\nCan we do four factors? $12 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 1$, but $1$ not allowed (since $e_i + 1 \\ge 2$). So max three factors.\n\nSo best is $3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 315$\n\nIs there better? What about $3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 315$, or $3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11$ would require $d$ factor $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times ?$, but $12$ has only three prime factors counting multiplicity: $2,2,3$, so max three $f_i$'s.\n\nSo minimal additional part is $3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 315$\n\nThus minimal $n = 2^{250} \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$\n\nBut wait — is assigning the largest exponent to smallest prime always best? Yes.\n\nBut we assumed $e_1 + 1 = 251$, $e_1 = 250$ on prime $2$\n\nCould we instead use $e_1 + 1 = 502 = 2 \\times 251$, so $e_1 = 501$, then remaining factor $3012 / 502 = 6$, so $e_2 + 1 = 6$, $e_2 = 5$, so $n = 2^{501} \\cdot 3^5$, which is way bigger than $2^{250} \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, since exponent doubled.\n\nSimilarly, $e_1 + 1 = 753 = 3 \\times 251$, $e_1 = 752$, remaining $4$, $n = 2^{752} \\cdot 3^3$, worse.\n\nOr $e_1 + 1 = 3012$, $e_1 = 3011$, $n = 2^{3011}$, astronomically worse.\n\nSo best is $e_1 + 1 = 251$, $e_1 = 250$, and factor remaining $12$ into as many small factors as possible, assigned to next smallest primes with exponents in decreasing order.\n\nWe have $12 = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2$, so exponents $2,1,1$, sorted decreasing: $2,1,1$\n\nAssign to primes $3,5,7$: so $3^2 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 7^1$\n\nThus $n = 2^{250} \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$\n\nNow, sum of prime factors with multiplicity:\n\n- From $2^{250}$: $250$ copies of $2$: sum = $250 \\times 2 = 500$  \n- From $3^2$: two $3$s: $2 \\times 3 = 6$  \n- From $5^1$: one $5$: $5$  \n- From $7^1$: one $7$: $7$  \n\nTotal sum = $500 + 6 + 5 + 7 = 518$\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's confirm.\n\nPrime factorization: $n = 2^{250} \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1$\n\nPrime factors with multiplicity: $2$ appears 250 times, $3$ appears 2 times, $5$ once, $7$ once.\n\nSo sum = $250 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\cdot 5 + 1 \\cdot 7 = 500 + 6 + 5 + 7 = 518$\n\nYes.\n\nBut is this indeed the minimal $n$?\n\nAlternative: could we use $12 = 4 \\times 3$, so exponents $3$ and $2$, assign to $3^3$ and $5^2$: $n = 2^{250} \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^2 = 2^{250} \\cdot 27 \\cdot 25 = 2^{250} \\cdot 675$\n\nCompare to $2^{250} \\cdot 315$: $315 < 675$, so $315$ is better.\n\n$12 = 6 \\times 2$: exponents $5$ and $1$: $3^5 \\cdot 5 = 243 \\cdot 5 = 1215 > 315$\n\n$12 = 12$: $3^{11} = 177147 > 315$\n\nSo yes, $3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 315$ is minimal.\n\nThus $n = 2^{250} \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, sum of prime factors with multiplicity = $518$\n\n✅ Answer is $518$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding l, the terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence in the case analysis for middle addends b in unordered triples summing to 2002. The possible b range from 1 to 1000, split at b = 667, giving sequences b = 1 to 667 (length 667) and b = 668 to 1000 (length 333). The shorter sequence ends at l = 1000. Then l + 2012 = 3012. The smallest n with exactly 3012 positive divisors must have divisor function d(n) = 3012 = 2^2 * 3 * 251. Since 251 is prime, one exponent must be 250 (as e_i + 1 = 251). To minimize n, assign exponent 250 to the smallest prime, 2. The remaining factor 12 = 3012 / 251 is factored as 3 * 2 * 2, giving exponents 2, 1, 1, assigned to next smallest primes 3, 5, 7, yielding n = 2^250 * 3^2 * 5 * 7. The sum of prime factors with multiplicity is 250*2 + 2*3 + 1*5 + 1*7 = 500 + 6 + 5 + 7 = 518.\",  \n    \"answer\": \"518\"\n}",
