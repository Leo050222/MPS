  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-step problem. Let's break it down carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the probability problem**\n\nAlice starts with 2015 rocks. At each round, if there are $ N $ rocks, she removes $ k \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,N\\} $ uniformly at random (i.e., each $ k $ has probability $ \\frac{1}{N} $). She continues until the pile is empty.\n\nLet $ p $ be the probability that **after each round**, the number of rocks left is a multiple of 5.\n\nThat is: starting from 2015, after round 1, remaining rocks = $ 2015 - k_1 $ must be divisible by 5; after round 2, remaining = $ 2015 - k_1 - k_2 $ must be divisible by 5; and so on, until reaching 0.\n\nSo the sequence of pile sizes:\n- Initially: $ N_0 = 2015 $\n- After round 1: $ N_1 = N_0 - k_1 $\n- After round 2: $ N_2 = N_1 - k_2 = N_0 - k_1 - k_2 $\n- ...\n- Eventually $ N_t = 0 $\n\nWe require that **every** $ N_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} $, for all $ i = 0,1,2,\\dots,t $. Since $ N_0 = 2015 $, and $ 2015 \\div 5 = 403 $, so $ 2015 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} $. So initial condition holds.\n\nSo we need the entire path from 2015 down to 0 to stay within multiples of 5 — i.e., all intermediate pile sizes must be multiples of 5.\n\nThat means all removals $ k_i $ must be multiples of 5 as well, because:\n\nIf $ N_{i-1} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} $, and $ N_i = N_{i-1} - k_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} $, then $ k_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} $.\n\nSo at each step, when pile size is $ N $ (a multiple of 5), Alice must remove a multiple of 5 rocks, and $ k \\in [1,N] $, so allowed $ k $'s are $ 5,10,15,\\dots,N $, i.e., multiples of 5 up to $ N $.\n\nSo number of valid choices at pile size $ N $ (where $ N \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 $) is $ \\frac{N}{5} $, since $ k = 5,10,\\dots,N $ → total $ N/5 $ options.\n\nTotal possible choices at pile size $ N $ is $ N $.\n\nSo conditional probability that she picks a multiple-of-5 $ k $, given current pile size $ N $, is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{N/5}{N} = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$\n\nBUT — this only applies when $ N $ is divisible by 5. However, in our event, we *require* that all pile sizes remain divisible by 5, so the process is constrained to only those states: $ N = 2015, 2010, 2005, \\dots, 5, 0 $. So the process is effectively a Markov chain on the states $ 0,5,10,\\dots,2015 $.\n\nLet’s define $ S_n = $ state with $ 5n $ rocks. Then initial state is $ n_0 = 2015 / 5 = 403 $. Final state is $ n = 0 $.\n\nAt state $ n $ (i.e., $ 5n $ rocks), Alice must remove $ k \\in \\{5,10,\\dots,5n\\} $, i.e., $ k = 5j $ where $ j \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,n\\} $. So she chooses $ j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\} $ uniformly among $ n $ options? Wait — no: original rule says she picks $ k \\in \\{1,\\dots,5n\\} $ uniformly. So probability that $ k \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 $ is $ \\frac{n}{5n} = \\frac{1}{5} $, as before.\n\nBut crucially, **given that she stays in the \"good\" path**, the conditional probability to go from $ 5n $ to $ 5(n-1) $ is not uniform over $ j $, because she could jump multiple steps: e.g., from 2015 she could remove 10 → go to 2005 (i.e., $ n $ drops by 2), or remove 15 → drop by 3, etc.\n\nSo the process can skip intermediate multiples of 5. But the condition is that *every* intermediate pile size must be multiple of 5 — so she cannot skip: if she removes $ k = 10 $ from 2015, pile becomes 2005 — still multiple of 5, fine. If she removes $ k = 15 $, goes to 2000 — also fine. So jumps are allowed, as long as landing positions are multiples of 5 — which they will be iff $ k \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 $.\n\nSo the constraint is just: at each step, given current $ N \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 $, she must pick $ k \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 $, and $ 1 \\le k \\le N $. So number of favorable $ k $ is $ \\lfloor N/5 \\rfloor = N/5 $, since $ N $ divisible by 5.\n\nSo at each step with $ N = 5n $, probability of staying in good set is $ \\frac{1}{5} $, independent of $ n $.\n\nBut wait — is that correct? Let's test small case.\n\nSuppose start with $ N = 5 $. Then possible $ k = 1,2,3,4,5 $, each with prob $ \\frac{1}{5} $. To stay in multiples of 5 after removal, need $ 5 - k \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\Rightarrow k \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 $. Only $ k = 5 $ works → probability $ \\frac{1}{5} $. OK.\n\nIf $ N = 10 $: $ k = 1 $ to $ 10 $. Need $ 10 - k \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\Rightarrow k \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 $, so $ k = 5 $ or $ 10 $ → 2 options → probability $ \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5} $. Yes.\n\nSo indeed, for any $ N \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 $, exactly $ N/5 $ values of $ k \\in [1,N] $ satisfy $ k \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 $, so probability is always $ \\frac{1}{5} $.\n\nTherefore, the probability that *all* intermediate pile sizes are multiples of 5 is the product of probabilities at each step *along the path*, but the number of steps is random! Because depending on how much she removes each time, the number of rounds varies.\n\nHowever, note: the event requires that *every* pile size after each round is divisible by 5 — including the last non-zero one, which must be 5 (since next removal brings it to 0). So the path must go through some decreasing sequence of multiples of 5 ending at 0.\n\nLet’s define the “good” paths as sequences:\n\n$$\n2015 = 5n_0 > 5n_1 > 5n_2 > \\dots > 5n_t = 0,\n$$\n\nwith $ n_0 = 403 $, $ n_t = 0 $, and each $ n_i < n_{i-1} $, and at step $ i $, she removes $ k_i = 5(n_{i-1} - n_i) $, which must satisfy $ 1 \\le k_i \\le 5n_{i-1} $, i.e., $ n_{i-1} - n_i \\ge 1 $ and $ \\le n_{i-1} $, so $ n_i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n_{i-1}-1\\} $. So $ n_i $ can be any integer strictly less than $ n_{i-1} $, down to 0.\n\nSo the $ n $-process is: start at $ n = 403 $, at each step choose $ j \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,n\\} $ (since $ k = 5j $, and $ k \\le 5n \\Rightarrow j \\le n $), then go to $ n' = n - j $. So $ n' \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\} $, uniformly? No — recall: original $ k \\in \\{1,\\dots,5n\\} $ uniformly, and only $ k $ divisible by 5 are allowed, and among those, $ k = 5j $ for $ j = 1 $ to $ n $, each occurs with probability $ \\frac{1}{5n} $, and there are $ n $ such $ k $, so conditional on choosing a multiple-of-5 $ k $, each $ j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\} $ is equally likely — probability $ \\frac{1}{n} $.\n\nBut the *unconditional* probability of a particular path $ n_0 \\to n_1 \\to \\dots \\to n_t = 0 $ is:\n\nAt state $ n_{i-1} $, probability to pick $ k = 5(n_{i-1} - n_i) $ is $ \\frac{1}{5 n_{i-1}} $, since all $ k \\in [1,5n_{i-1}] $ equally likely.\n\nSo for path $ 403 = n_0 > n_1 > \\dots > n_t = 0 $, the probability is:\n\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^{t} \\frac{1}{5 n_{i-1}} = \\frac{1}{5^t} \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{t} \\frac{1}{n_{i-1}}\n$$\n\nBut the total probability $ p $ is sum over all such paths of this quantity.\n\nThis seems messy. But maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLet’s define $ f(n) $ = probability that, starting from $ 5n $ rocks, the process stays within multiples of 5 throughout until 0.\n\nWe want $ f(403) $.\n\nBase case: $ f(0) = 1 $ (already done).\n\nFor $ n \\ge 1 $, from $ 5n $, Alice picks $ k \\in \\{1,\\dots,5n\\} $ uniformly. To stay good, need $ k \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 $, i.e., $ k = 5j $, $ j = 1 $ to $ n $. For each such $ j $, new pile size is $ 5n - 5j = 5(n-j) $, so state becomes $ n-j $. So:\n\n$$\nf(n) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\Pr(k = 5j) \\cdot f(n-j) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{5n} \\cdot f(n-j)\n$$\n\nSo\n\n$$\nf(n) = \\frac{1}{5n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} f(n-j) = \\frac{1}{5n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(i)\n$$\n\nwhere $ i = n-j $.\n\nLet $ S(n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} f(i) $. Then $ \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(i) = S(n-1) $.\n\nSo\n\n$$\nf(n) = \\frac{S(n-1)}{5n}\n$$\n\nAlso, $ S(n) = S(n-1) + f(n) = S(n-1) + \\frac{S(n-1)}{5n} = S(n-1)\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{5n}\\right) = S(n-1) \\cdot \\frac{5n + 1}{5n} $\n\nWith $ S(0) = f(0) = 1 $.\n\nSo recursively:\n\n$$\nS(n) = \\prod_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{5k + 1}{5k}\n$$\n\nBecause:\n\n- $ S(1) = S(0) \\cdot \\frac{5\\cdot1 + 1}{5\\cdot1} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{6}{5} $\n- $ S(2) = S(1) \\cdot \\frac{11}{10} = \\frac{6}{5} \\cdot \\frac{11}{10} $\n- etc.\n\nSo\n\n$$\nS(n) = \\prod_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{5k + 1}{5k} = \\prod_{k=1}^{n} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{5k}\\right)\n$$\n\nThen $ f(n) = \\frac{S(n-1)}{5n} $, so\n\n$$\nf(n) = \\frac{1}{5n} \\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{5k + 1}{5k}\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\nf(403) = \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 403} \\prod_{k=1}^{402} \\frac{5k + 1}{5k}\n$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$$\nf(403) = \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 403} \\cdot \\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^{402} (5k + 1)}{\\prod_{k=1}^{402} 5k}\n= \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 403} \\cdot \\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^{402} (5k + 1)}{5^{402} \\cdot 402!}\n$$\n\nNote $ \\prod_{k=1}^{402} 5k = 5^{402} \\cdot (1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot 402) = 5^{402} \\cdot 402! $\n\nNow numerator: $ \\prod_{k=1}^{402} (5k + 1) = 6 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 16 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot (5 \\cdot 402 + 1) = 6 \\cdot 11 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot 2011 $\n\nObserve: $ 5k + 1 $ for $ k = 1 $ to $ 402 $ gives numbers congruent to 1 mod 5, from 6 to 2011.\n\nWhat is $ 5 \\cdot 402 + 1 = 2010 + 1 = 2011 $. Yes.\n\nSo numerator is product of arithmetic progression: first term 6, last 2011, difference 5, number of terms = 402.\n\nWe can write this product as:\n\n$$\n\\prod_{k=1}^{402} (5k + 1) = \\prod_{j=1}^{402} (5j + 1)\n$$\n\nDoes this contain factor 31? Let's see when $ 5j + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 31 \\Rightarrow 5j \\equiv -1 \\equiv 30 \\mod 31 \\Rightarrow j \\equiv 30 \\cdot 5^{-1} \\mod 31 $\n\nSince $ 5 \\cdot 6 = 30 \\equiv -1 $, so $ 5 \\cdot 25 = 125 \\equiv 125 - 4\\cdot31 = 125 - 124 = 1 \\mod 31 $, so $ 5^{-1} \\equiv 25 \\mod 31 $. So $ j \\equiv 30 \\cdot 25 = 750 \\equiv 750 \\mod 31 $. Compute $ 31 \\cdot 24 = 744 $, so $ 750 - 744 = 6 $. So $ j \\equiv 6 \\mod 31 $.\n\nSo $ j = 6, 37, 68, \\dots $ up to ≤ 402.\n\nSequence: $ j_m = 6 + 31(m-1) $. Max $ m $ s.t. $ 6 + 31(m-1) \\le 402 \\Rightarrow 31(m-1) \\le 396 \\Rightarrow m-1 \\le 12.77 \\Rightarrow m \\le 13 $. So $ m = 1 $ to $ 13 $: $ j = 6,37,68,99,130,161,192,223,254,285,316,347,378 $. Next would be $ 409 > 402 $. So 13 values.\n\nThus numerator has exactly 13 factors divisible by 31? Not necessarily — could be higher powers, but likely just one factor each, unless some $ 5j+1 $ divisible by $ 31^2 = 961 $. Check if any $ 5j + 1 = 961 \\Rightarrow j = (960)/5 = 192 $. Yes! $ j = 192 $ gives $ 5*192 + 1 = 960 + 1 = 961 = 31^2 $. So that term contributes $ 31^2 $.\n\nAny $ 5j + 1 = 31^3 = 29791 $? Too big, since max is 2011. So only possible higher power is $ 31^2 $, and it appears once.\n\nSo total exponent of 31 in numerator is: number of $ j \\in [1,402] $ such that $ 31 \\mid (5j+1) $, plus extra 1 if $ 31^2 \\mid (5j+1) $. We have 13 values where $ 31 \\mid $, and among them, $ j = 192 $ gives $ 5j+1 = 961 = 31^2 $, so contributes exponent 2 instead of 1 ⇒ total exponent = $ 13 + 1 = 14 $.\n\nWait: standard prime exponent in product is sum over terms of exponent of 31 in each term. So for each $ j $, compute $ v_{31}(5j+1) $, sum them.\n\nWe know $ 5j+1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 31 $ for $ j \\equiv 6 \\mod 31 $. So $ j = 6 + 31t $, $ t = 0 $ to $ 12 $ (since $ t = 0 \\to j = 6 $, $ t = 12 \\to j = 6 + 372 = 378 $, next $ t = 13 \\to 409 > 402 $). So $ t = 0,1,\\dots,12 $: 13 values.\n\nNow $ 5j + 1 = 5(6 + 31t) + 1 = 30 + 155t + 1 = 31 + 155t = 31(1 + 5t) $. So $ v_{31}(5j+1) = 1 + v_{31}(1 + 5t) $.\n\nSo need $ v_{31}(1 + 5t) $. When is $ 1 + 5t \\equiv 0 \\mod 31 $? $ 5t \\equiv -1 \\mod 31 \\Rightarrow t \\equiv -1 \\cdot 5^{-1} \\equiv -25 \\equiv 6 \\mod 31 $. So $ t = 6 $ gives $ 1 + 5*6 = 31 $, so $ v_{31} = 2 $. Next $ t = 6 + 31 = 37 $, but $ t \\le 12 $, so only $ t = 6 $.\n\nThus only one term with $ v_{31} = 2 $, others have $ v_{31} = 1 $. So total exponent of 31 in numerator = $ 12 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 2 = 14 $.\n\nNow denominator of $ f(403) $ is:\n\n- $ 5 \\cdot 403 \\cdot 5^{402} \\cdot 402! = 5^{403} \\cdot 403 \\cdot 402! = 5^{403} \\cdot 403! $\n\nSince $ 403 \\cdot 402! = 403! $.\n\nSo denominator is $ 5^{403} \\cdot 403! $\n\nNow factor 31 in denominator: $ v_{31}(403!) $. Since $ 31 \\cdot 12 = 372 $, $ 31 \\cdot 13 = 403 $, so $ 31 \\times 13 = 403 $, so 403! includes multiples: 31, 62, ..., 390, 403. How many? $ \\lfloor 403/31 \\rfloor = 13 $. Also $ \\lfloor 403/31^2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 403/961 \\rfloor = 0 $. So $ v_{31}(403!) = 13 $.\n\nSo total exponent of 31 in $ f(403) = $ (exponent in numerator) minus (exponent in denominator) = $ 14 - 13 = 1 $.\n\nSo $ b = 1 $.\n\nThe problem says: \"If $ p $ is of the form $ 5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d} $, where $ a,b $ are integers and $ c,d $ are positive integers relatively prime to $ 5 \\cdot 31 $, find $ a+b $. Instead of determining $ a + b $ for the probability $ p $ in the specified form, simply find $ m = b + 2 $, where $ b $ is the exponent of $ 31 $ in that form.\"\n\nSo $ b = 1 \\Rightarrow m = 1 + 2 = 3 $.\n\nSo $ m = 3 $.\n\nNow we need to solve the system:\n\n$$\nx + y + z = m = 3 \\\\\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = m = 3 \\\\\nx^m + y^m + z^m = m = 3\n$$\n\nSince $ m = 3 $, the third equation is $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 $.\n\nSo system:\n\n1. $ x + y + z = 3 $\n2. $ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3 $\n3. $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 $\n\nWe are to find **all roots**, real or complex, of this system — i.e., all ordered triples $ (x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{C}^3 $ satisfying these.\n\nBut likely they want the set of solutions, perhaps up to permutation, or list them? The problem says \"Determine all the roots, real or complex, of the system\", but then asks for final answer in JSON with \"answer\": \"...\". Probably expects the number of solutions? Or the solutions themselves? But format suggests a single value.\n\nWait, re-read: \"Determine all the roots [...]\". But final answer is to be in JSON with \"answer\": \"your final answer\". And rules say \"for numerical answers, provide the exact value\". So likely they want the number of complex solutions (counting multiplicity? or distinct?).\n\nBut systems of polynomial equations can have infinitely many solutions, unless zero-dimensional.\n\nLet’s analyze.\n\nLet $ s_1 = x+y+z = 3 $\n\n$ s_2 = xy + yz + zx $. Recall identity:\n\n$ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = s_1^2 - 2 s_2 $\n\nGiven $ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3 $, and $ s_1 = 3 $, so:\n\n$ 3 = 9 - 2 s_2 \\Rightarrow 2 s_2 = 6 \\Rightarrow s_2 = 3 $\n\nSo $ xy + yz + zx = 3 $\n\nNow $ s_3 = xyz $. Use identity:\n\n$ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 + 3 s_3 $\n\nPlug in:\n\n$ 3 = 27 - 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 + 3 s_3 = 27 - 27 + 3 s_3 = 0 + 3 s_3 \\Rightarrow s_3 = 1 $\n\nSo elementary symmetric sums:\n\n- $ s_1 = 3 $\n- $ s_2 = 3 $\n- $ s_3 = 1 $\n\nTherefore, $ x,y,z $ are roots of the cubic:\n\n$$\nt^3 - s_1 t^2 + s_2 t - s_3 = 0 \\Rightarrow t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t - 1 = 0\n$$\n\nNotice: $ t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t - 1 = (t-1)^3 $\n\nYes! Because $ (t-1)^3 = t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t - 1 $\n\nSo the cubic has triple root $ t = 1 $.\n\nTherefore, the only solution (up to ordering) is $ x = y = z = 1 $.\n\nSince the system is symmetric, the only solution in $ \\mathbb{C}^3 $ is $ (1,1,1) $. Are there others? Suppose two variables equal, but the cubic forces all three to be 1. Since the elementary symmetric sums uniquely determine the multiset of roots, and here it's $ \\{1,1,1\\} $, so only solution is $ x=y=z=1 $.\n\nThus there is exactly **one** solution (as an unordered triple), but as an ordered triple, it's just one: $ (1,1,1) $.\n\nSo the system has a unique solution in $ \\mathbb{C}^3 $.\n\nHence the answer is likely **1**, but let's confirm.\n\nCould there be other solutions where variables are not all equal? Suppose $ x,y,z $ are not all equal, but still satisfy the symmetric sums. But the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials says that the multiset of roots is uniquely determined by $ s_1,s_2,s_3 $, so if $ x,y,z $ satisfy those, they must be 1,1,1 in some order. So only solution is $ x=y=z=1 $.\n\nThus only one ordered triple.\n\nSo answer is 1.\n\nBut wait — the problem says \"Determine all the roots, real or complex, of the system\". It might expect listing them, but JSON answer is a single value. Given the format examples (\"42\", \"Monday\"), and instruction \"put ONLY the answer value\", likely they want the number of solutions, which is 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the value of $ m $, but no — $ m $ was intermediate; problem says \"Determine all the roots [...]\". But final answer field is singular.\n\nLet me double-check calculations.\n\nWe found $ m = b + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 $. Correct.\n\nThen system:\n\n$ x+y+z = 3 $\n\n$ x^2+y^2+z^2 = 3 $\n\nSubtracting: $ (x+y+z)^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2 + 2(xy+yz+zx) \\Rightarrow 9 = 3 + 2s_2 \\Rightarrow s_2 = 3 $. OK.\n\nThen $ x^3+y^3+z^3 = s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 3s_3 = 27 - 27 + 3s_3 = 3s_3 = 3 \\Rightarrow s_3 = 1 $. OK.\n\nCubic: $ t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t - 1 = (t-1)^3 $. Yes.\n\nSo only solution is $ x=y=z=1 $. So one solution.\n\nHence answer is 1.\n\nBut wait — is multiplicity considered? In algebraic geometry, the system defines a zero-dimensional variety with multiplicity, but usually \"number of solutions\" counting multiplicity for $ (t-1)^3 $ would be 3, but here it's a system in three variables, but reduced to one cubic, so the solution set is a single point with multiplicity? But the question says \"determine all the roots\", and in context of competitions, usually means distinct solutions.\n\nMoreover, the solution $ (1,1,1) $ is the only one.\n\nThus answer is 1.\n\nBut let's see if there are other solutions where variables are not all equal — suppose $ x=1, y=1, z=1 $ is only possibility.\n\nAssume $ x,y,z $ real: then from $ x+y+z = 3 $, $ x^2+y^2+z^2 = 3 $, by Cauchy-Schwarz, $ (x^2+y^2+z^2)(1^2+1^2+1^2) \\ge (x+y+z)^2 \\Rightarrow 3 \\cdot 3 \\ge 9 $, equality holds iff $ x=y=z $. So in reals, only solution is $ x=y=z=1 $. In complexes, same symmetric sum argument forces the elementary symmetric sums, hence same cubic, so same multiset.\n\nThus only solution is $ (1,1,1) $.\n\nSo number of solutions is 1.\n\nAnswer is 1.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We first determine b, the exponent of 31 in the probability p. The probability p that all intermediate pile sizes are multiples of 5 starting from 2015 leads to a recursive function f(n) for n = 403 (since 2015 = 5*403). Analysis shows f(403) = (1/(5^403 * 403!)) * product_{k=1}^{402} (5k + 1). The exponent of 31 in the numerator is 14 (13 terms divisible by 31, one of which is 31^2), and in the denominator 403! has exponent 13, giving b = 14 - 13 = 1. Thus m = b + 2 = 3. The system x + y + z = 3, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3, x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 implies elementary symmetric sums s1 = 3, s2 = 3, s3 = 1, leading to cubic (t - 1)^3 = 0.
