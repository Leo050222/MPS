  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n**Game Rules Recap:**\n\n- Two card types: planet cards (P) and hegemon cards (H).\n- Each planet card is worth **2010 points**, fixed.\n- Each hegemon card is worth **4 points per planet card held** at the time of taking it.\n    - So if you currently hold `p` planet cards, a hegemon card taken now is worth `4p` points.\n- You start with 0 planet cards, 0 hegemon cards.\n- On each turn `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`, you choose the card type that gives **more points** *given your current hand*.\n    - If tie? The problem says “whichever is worth more”, implying strict inequality; but we must check if ties occur.\n- Define sequence `{a_n}`:\n    - `a_n = 0` if you take a planet card on turn `n`\n    - `a_n = 1` if you take a hegemon card on turn `n`\n\nWe need to compute `a_502`, then compute `k = a_502 + 9`.\n\nSo first, understand the dynamics.\n\nLet’s define state at turn `n` (before choosing card `n`) as `(p_n, h_n)` = number of planet and hegemon cards held before turn `n`. Initially, before turn 1: `(p_1, h_1) = (0, 0)`.\n\nAt turn `n`, you compare:\n- Planet card value = 2010\n- Hegemon card value = `4 * p_n`\n\nYou pick the one with higher value. If equal, need to know tie-breaking rule — but problem says “whichever is worth more”, so perhaps tie is not possible or we assume planet is chosen? But let’s see when equality occurs:\n\nSet `4p = 2010` → `p = 2010 / 4 = 502.5`, not integer ⇒ no tie possible, since `p` is always integer. So no ties ever.\n\nSo decision rule is clean:\n\n- If `4p_n < 2010` → planet card is better → take planet → `a_n = 0`\n- If `4p_n > 2010` → hegemon card is better → take hegemon → `a_n = 1`\n\nNote: `4p_n > 2010 ⇔ p_n ≥ 503`, since `4×502 = 2008 < 2010`, `4×503 = 2012 > 2010`.\n\nSo:\n\n- As long as current number of planet cards `p < 503`, planet card is better → you take planet.\n- Once `p ≥ 503`, hegemon card is better → you’ll prefer hegemon.\n\nBut wait: once you start taking hegemon cards, `p` stays same (since hegemon doesn’t increase planet count), so `p` remains constant, and `4p` stays same, so hegemon remains better forever? Yes — unless `p` changes.\n\nSo key idea:\n\n- Initially `p = 0`: `4p = 0 < 2010` → take planet → `p = 1`\n- Then `p = 1`: `4 < 2010` → take planet → `p = 2`\n- ...\n- Continue until `p = 502`: `4×502 = 2008 < 2010` → still take planet → `p = 503`\n- Now `p = 503`: `4×503 = 2012 > 2010` → take hegemon → `h` increases, `p` unchanged.\n\nSo up to turn `503`, you take planet cards? Let's verify.\n\nStart: before turn 1: `p = 0`\n\n- Turn 1: `p = 0` → take planet → `p = 1`\n- Turn 2: `p = 1` → take planet → `p = 2`\n- ...\n- Turn `t`: before turn `t`, `p = t−1`. So you take planet as long as `4(t−1) < 2010` ⇒ `t−1 < 502.5` ⇒ `t ≤ 503`\n\nCheck:\n\n- Before turn 503: `p = 502`, `4×502 = 2008 < 2010` → take planet → `p = 503`\n- Before turn 504: `p = 503`, `4×503 = 2012 > 2010` → take hegemon\n\nSo:\n\n- Turns 1 through 503: all planet cards → `a_1 = a_2 = ... = a_503 = 0`\n- Starting turn 504: `p = 503`, so hegemon is better → you’ll take hegemon every turn from then on? Wait — but does `p` ever increase again? Only by taking planet cards. But once `p ≥ 503`, hegemon is always better, so you never take another planet card. So yes, from turn 504 onward, you always take hegemon → `a_n = 1` for all `n ≥ 504`.\n\nThus:\n\n- `a_1` through `a_503`: all 0\n- `a_504`, `a_505`, …: all 1\n\nTherefore:\n\n- `a_502 = 0` (since 502 ≤ 503)\n\nThen `k = a_502 + 9 = 0 + 9 = 9`\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **9**\n\nWait — double-check indexing.\n\nBefore turn `n`, you have `p = number of planet cards taken in turns 1 to n−1`.\n\nSo after `t` planet cards, you have `p = t`, and that happens *after* turn `t`.\n\nSo:\n\n- After turn 1: `p = 1`\n- After turn 2: `p = 2`\n- ...\n- After turn 502: `p = 502`\n- So **before turn 503**: `p = 502` → still take planet → `a_503 = 0`\n- Before turn 504: `p = 503` → take hegemon → `a_504 = 1`\n\nSo `a_502`: turn 502 → before turn 502, `p = 501`, `4×501 = 2004 < 2010` → take planet → `a_502 = 0`. Correct.\n\nYes, `a_502 = 0`, so `k = 9`.\n\n✅ Confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\nTwo positive rational numbers `x` and `y`, written in lowest terms, satisfy:\n\n- Sum of numerators = 9\n- Sum of denominators = 10\n\nLet `x = a/b`, `y = c/d`, where `gcd(a,b) = 1`, `gcd(c,d) = 1`, `a,b,c,d ∈ ℤ⁺`.\n\nGiven:\n\n- `a + c = 9`\n- `b + d = 10`\n\nWe want to **maximize** `x + y = a/b + c/d`.\n\nSince `a,c` are positive integers (x,y positive rationals), and `b,d` likewise.\n\nSo `a ∈ {1,2,…,8}`, `c = 9−a`, `b ∈ {1,2,…,9}`, `d = 10−b`.\n\nConstraints: fractions must be in lowest terms: `gcd(a,b)=1`, `gcd(c,d)=1`.\n\nWe need to maximize `a/b + (9−a)/(10−b)` over integers `a ∈ [1,8]`, `b ∈ [1,9]`, such that:\n\n- `gcd(a,b) = 1`\n- `gcd(9−a, 10−b) = 1`\n\nLet’s denote `S(a,b) = a/b + (9−a)/(10−b)`\n\nWe can try all feasible `(a,b)` pairs.\n\nBut smarter: to maximize sum of two positive fractions, we want large numerators and small denominators — but numerators and denominators are linked.\n\nSince `a + c = 9`, max numerator for one fraction is 8 (other is 1); similarly min denominator is 1.\n\nTry extremes.\n\n#### Try `b = 1`: then `d = 9`\n\nThen `x = a/1 = a`, integer; need `gcd(a,1)=1` always true.\n\n`y = (9−a)/9`, need `gcd(9−a,9)=1`\n\nSo `9−a` must be coprime to 9 ⇒ `9−a` not divisible by 3 ⇒ `a ≠ 9−3k`, i.e., `a ≠ 0,3,6,9`, but `a ∈ [1,8]`, so exclude `a = 3,6`\n\nSo allowed `a ∈ {1,2,4,5,7,8}`\n\nCompute `S = a + (9−a)/9 = a + 1 − a/9 = (9a + 9 − a)/9 = (8a + 9)/9`\n\nWait: `a + (9−a)/9 = (9a)/9 + (9−a)/9 = (9a + 9 − a)/9 = (8a + 9)/9`\n\nSo `S = (8a + 9)/9`, increasing in `a`, so maximize `a`: try `a = 8`\n\nThen `c = 1`, `d = 9`, `gcd(1,9)=1` ✅\n\n`x = 8/1 = 8`, `y = 1/9`, sum = `8 + 1/9 = 73/9 ≈ 8.111...`\n\nCheck if valid: `gcd(8,1)=1`, `gcd(1,9)=1` ✅\n\nWhat about `a = 7`: `x = 7/1 = 7`, `y = 2/9`, `gcd(2,9)=1`, sum = `7 + 2/9 = 65/9 ≈ 7.222` < 73/9\n\nSo `a=8, b=1` gives `73/9`\n\n#### Try `b = 2`, `d = 8`\n\nThen `x = a/2`, need `gcd(a,2)=1` ⇒ `a` odd: `a ∈ {1,3,5,7}` (since `a ≤ 8`, and `c = 9−a ≥ 1` ⇒ `a ≤ 8`)\n\nAlso `y = (9−a)/8`, need `gcd(9−a,8)=1` ⇒ `9−a` odd and not divisible by 2 ⇒ already odd if `a` even? Wait `9−a` odd ⇔ `a` even. But `a` must be odd ⇒ `9−a` even ⇒ `gcd(even,8) ≥ 2` unless `9−a = 2,6`? Let's list:\n\n- `a = 1`: `c = 8`, `d = 8`, `gcd(8,8) = 8 ≠ 1` ❌\n- `a = 3`: `c = 6`, `gcd(6,8) = 2` ❌\n- `a = 5`: `c = 4`, `gcd(4,8) = 4` ❌\n- `a = 7`: `c = 2`, `gcd(2,8) = 2` ❌\n\nSo no valid pair for `b = 2`\n\n#### `b = 3`, `d = 7`\n\nNeed `gcd(a,3)=1` ⇒ `a ≠ multiple of 3`: `a ∈ {1,2,4,5,7,8}`\n\nAnd `gcd(9−a,7)=1`. Since 7 is prime, need `9−a ≠ 7k`, i.e., `9−a ≠ 0,7,14,...` ⇒ `a ≠ 9,2,−5,...` So only forbidden `a = 2` (since `9−2 = 7`, `gcd(7,7)=7`)\n\nSo exclude `a = 2`\n\nSo candidates: `a = 1,4,5,7,8`\n\nCompute `S = a/3 + (9−a)/7`\n\nCompute for each:\n\n- `a = 1`: `1/3 + 8/7 = (7 + 24)/21 = 31/21 ≈ 1.476`\n- `a = 4`: `4/3 + 5/7 = (28 + 15)/21 = 43/21 ≈ 2.048`\n- `a = 5`: `5/3 + 4/7 = (35 + 12)/21 = 47/21 ≈ 2.238`\n- `a = 7`: `7/3 + 2/7 = (49 + 6)/21 = 55/21 ≈ 2.619`\n- `a = 8`: `8/3 + 1/7 = (56 + 3)/21 = 59/21 ≈ 2.809`\n\nAll much less than `73/9 ≈ 8.111`\n\n#### `b = 4`, `d = 6`\n\n`gcd(a,4)=1` ⇒ `a` odd and not multiple of 2 ⇒ `a ∈ {1,3,5,7}`\n\n`gcd(9−a,6)=1`: need `9−a` coprime to 6 ⇒ not divisible by 2 or 3.\n\nSo `9−a` must be odd ⇒ `a` even → conflict! Because `a` must be odd for `gcd(a,4)=1`, but then `9−a` even ⇒ `gcd ≥ 2`. So no solutions.\n\nIndeed:\n\n- `a = 1`: `c = 8`, `gcd(8,6)=2`\n- `a = 3`: `c = 6`, `gcd=6`\n- etc.\n\nNo good.\n\n#### `b = 5`, `d = 5`\n\n`gcd(a,5)=1` ⇒ `a ≠ 5`\n\n`a ∈ {1,2,3,4,6,7,8}`\n\n`gcd(9−a,5)=1` ⇒ `9−a ≠ 5k` ⇒ `a ≠ 9,4,−1,...` So exclude `a = 4` (since `9−4 = 5`)\n\nSo `a ∈ {1,2,3,6,7,8}`\n\nCompute `S = a/5 + (9−a)/5 = 9/5 = 1.8` — constant! Because same denominator. So max is `1.8`, less than `73/9`\n\n#### `b = 6`, `d = 4`: symmetric to `b = 4`, `d = 6`, likely no solution or low sum.\n\nBut let’s test `b = 9`, `d = 1`: symmetric to `b = 1`, `d = 9`, i.e., swap x and y.\n\nThen `x = a/9`, `y = c/1 = c`, with `a + c = 9`, so `c = 9−a`, `x = a/9`, `y = 9−a`\n\nSum = `a/9 + 9−a = 9 − a(1 − 1/9) = 9 − (8a)/9 = (81 − 8a)/9`\n\nThis is decreasing in `a`, so maximize at smallest `a`: `a = 1`\n\nThen `x = 1/9`, `y = 8/1 = 8`, same sum `73/9`. So same max.\n\nNow check if any other combo gives higher.\n\nWhat about `b = 1`, `a = 8`: got `73/9 ≈ 8.111`\n\nCan we get higher? Next best would be `a = 8`, `b = 1` is best for x; what if `a = 9`? Not allowed, since `a + c = 9`, `a,c ≥ 1`, so max `a = 8`.\n\nWhat about `b = 1`, `a = 8`: done.\n\nIs there a case where one fraction is larger than 8? Only if denominator < 1, impossible.\n\nSo `x = 8/1 = 8` is max possible value for one term; adding positive y makes sum > 8, but y is at least `1/d`, and `d = 10−b = 9`, so `y = 1/9`, total `73/9`.\n\nCould we get `x = 9/1`? No, because then `c = 0`, but y must be positive rational ⇒ `c ≥ 1`, so `a ≤ 8`.\n\nSimilarly, `b = 1` is minimal denominator.\n\nSo `73/9` seems maximum.\n\nBut wait — what if `b = 1`, `a = 8`, `c = 1`, `d = 9`: sum `8 + 1/9 = 73/9`\n\nIs there a way to get, say, `x = 7/1 = 7`, `y = 2/1 = 2`? That would require `d = 1`, so `b = 9`, `a = 7`, `c = 2`, `d = 1`: check gcd: `gcd(7,9)=1`, `gcd(2,1)=1`, OK.\n\nThen sum = `7 + 2 = 9`\n\nWait! Hold on! `b + d = 10`, so if `d = 1`, then `b = 9`. And `a + c = 9`. So `a = 7`, `c = 2`, `b = 9`, `d = 1`: then `x = 7/9`, `y = 2/1 = 2`, sum = `7/9 + 2 = 25/9 ≈ 2.777`, not 9. I misread.\n\n`x = a/b = 7/9`, not `7/1`. Denominator is `b`, not `d`. So if `b = 9`, `x = a/9`, small.\n\nTo get large `x`, need small `b`, like `b = 1`.\n\nSo `b = 1`, `d = 9` is best for making one term large.\n\nWhat about `b = 1`, `a = 8`, `c = 1`, `d = 9`: sum `8 + 1/9 = 73/9`\n\nWhat about `b = 1`, `a = 5`, `c = 4`, `d = 9`: `5 + 4/9 = 49/9 ≈ 5.444`, smaller.\n\nSo `a = 8` best.\n\nAny other `b` giving larger sum? Try `b = 1`, `a = 8`: done.\n\nWhat about `b = 1`, `a = 8`, but is `gcd(8,1)=1`? Yes.\n\n`c = 1`, `d = 9`, `gcd(1,9)=1`: yes.\n\nSo `73/9` is achievable.\n\nIs there a way to get `x + y > 73/9`?\n\nSuppose `b = 1`, `a = 8`, `c = 1`, `d = 9`: sum `73/9 ≈ 8.111`\n\nWhat if `b = 1`, `a = 8`, `c = 1`, but `d = 9` is forced.\n\nCould `d` be smaller? `d = 10 − b`, so if `b = 1`, `d = 9`; if `b = 2`, `d = 8`, etc. So `d` minimized when `b` maximized, but then `x = a/b` becomes small.\n\nSo trade-off.\n\nTry `b = 8`, `d = 2`: then `x = a/8`, `y = c/2`, with `a + c = 9`\n\nTo maximize `a/8 + c/2 = a/8 + (9−a)/2 = a/8 + 9/2 − a/2 = 9/2 + a(1/8 − 4/8) = 9/2 − (3a)/8`\n\nDecreasing in `a`, so minimize `a`: `a = 1`, then `c = 8`, `x = 1/8`, `y = 8/2 = 4`, but `y = 8/2 = 4/1`? Wait, `y = c/d = 8/2 = 4`, but must be in lowest terms: `8/2 = 4/1`, so `y = 4/1`, meaning reduced form has denominator 1, but problem says \"when written in lowest terms\", so `c/d` must be reduced ⇒ `gcd(c,d) = 1`. Here `gcd(8,2) = 2 ≠ 1`, so invalid. So `c = 8`, `d = 2` not allowed.\n\nSo need `gcd(c,d) = 1`. For `d = 2`, `c` must be odd.\n\nSo `c ∈ {1,3,5,7}`, `a = 9−c ∈ {8,6,4,2}`\n\nThen `x = a/8`, need `gcd(a,8)=1` ⇒ `a` odd ⇒ but `a` is even in all cases above ⇒ no solution for `b = 8`.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the maximum is indeed `73/9`.\n\nBut wait — double-check if `73/9` is the largest possible.\n\nWhat about `b = 1`, `a = 8`, `c = 1`, `d = 9`: sum `8 + 1/9 = 73/9`\n\nWhat about `b = 1`, `a = 7`, `c = 2`, `d = 9`: `7 + 2/9 = 65/9 ≈ 7.222`\n\nOr `b = 1`, `a = 8`, `c = 1`, `d = 9`: best.\n\nIs there `b = 1`, `a = 8`, `d = 9`, yes.\n\nAny other combination where one term is integer > 8? Impossible since `a ≤ 8`.\n\nSo `73/9` is max.\n\nBut problem asks: “What is the largest possible value of `x+y`?”\n\nSo answer is `73/9`\n\nBut is `73/9` reducible? 73 is prime, 9 = 3², no common factor ⇒ already reduced.\n\nSo answer is `73/9`\n\nBut let me confirm no other pair gives higher.\n\nTry `b = 1`, `a = 8`, `c = 1`, `d = 9`: works.\n\nTry `b = 1`, `a = 8`, `c = 1`, but `d` must be `10 − b = 9`, yes.\n\nAnother idea: `b = 1`, `a = 8`, `x = 8/1`, fine.\n\n`y = 1/9`, fine.\n\nSum = `73/9`\n\nAlternatively, `x = 1/9`, `y = 8/1`: same sum.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThus answer to Problem 2 is `73/9`\n\nBut wait — the problem says “two positive rational numbers x and y, when written in lowest terms, have the property that the sum of their numerators is 9 and the sum of their denominators is 10”.\n\nImportant: It says “the sum of their numerators” — meaning, if `x = a/b` reduced, `y = c/d` reduced, then `a + c = 9`, `b + d = 10`.\n\nYes, that’s how we interpreted.\n\nSo `73/9` is correct.\n\nBut let me see if `x = 5/1 = 5`, `y = 4/9`, sum = `5 + 4/9 = 49/9 ≈ 5.444`, less.\n\nOr `x = 9/1` invalid since then `c = 0`.\n\nSo yes.\n\n✅ Answer is `73/9`\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers:\n\n- Problem 1: `a_502 = 0`, so `k = 0 + 9 = 9`\n- Problem 2: `73/9`\n\nNow format JSON.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The decision rule compares 2010 (planet card value) vs 4p (hegemon card value, where p is current number of planet cards).
