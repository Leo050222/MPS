  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\nWe have a \"fat coin\" with probabilities:\n\n- Heads (H): $ \\frac{2}{5} $ → move left (−1)\n- Tails (T): $ \\frac{2}{5} $ → move right (+1)\n- Edge (E): $ \\frac{1}{5} $ → reset to 0\n\nMr. Fat starts at 0 on the integer line (though positions are integers, since moves are ±1 or reset to 0). So state space is all integers $ \\mathbb{Z} $, but due to symmetry (same prob for left/right), stationary distribution is symmetric: $ \\pi_n = \\pi_{-n} $.\n\nLet $ \\pi_n $ be the stationary probability of being at position $ n $. We want to find $ r $, the factor such that for $ n \\neq 0 $,  \n$$\n\\pi_{n+1} = r \\cdot \\pi_n \\quad \\text{(for } n \\ge 1\\text{)}.\n$$\nThat is, the stationary distribution decays geometrically away from 0 (for positive positions), with ratio $ r < 1 $. Then compute $ e = r + \\frac{9}{2} $.\n\nWe are told to derive $ r $ from the *balance equations* for non-zero positions.\n\nLet’s write balance equations.\n\nFor any state $ n \\neq 0 $, the stationary distribution satisfies:\n\n$$\n\\pi_n = \\text{inflow to } n = \\text{outflow from } n \\text{ (but balance is inflow = outflow)}.\n$$\n\nStandard global balance: For each state $ n $,\n$$\n\\pi_n \\cdot (\\text{total rate out}) = \\sum_{m} \\pi_m \\cdot P(m \\to n).\n$$\n\nBut since it's a discrete-time Markov chain (one toss per minute), we use stationarity condition:\n\n$$\n\\pi_n = \\sum_{m} \\pi_m P(m \\to n).\n$$\n\nLet’s define transition probabilities:\n\n- From any state $ m $:\n  - To $ m-1 $: if heads → $ \\frac{2}{5} $, unless $ m = 0 $, but wait — no, movement rules are same regardless of current position? Let's re-read:\n\n> \"If it's heads, he moves left, decreasing his coordinate by 1; if it's tails, he moves right, increasing his coordinate by 1. If the coin lands on its edge, he moves back to 0.\"\n\nSo yes — from any position $ m $:\n\n- With prob $ \\frac{2}{5} $: go to $ m-1 $\n- With prob $ \\frac{2}{5} $: go to $ m+1 $\n- With prob $ \\frac{1}{5} $: go to $ 0 $\n\nSo transitions are:\n\n- $ P(m \\to m-1) = \\frac{2}{5} $\n- $ P(m \\to m+1) = \\frac{2}{5} $\n- $ P(m \\to 0) = \\frac{1}{5} $\n- All other transitions: 0\n\nSo for $ n \\neq 0 $, who can transition to $ n $?\n\n- From $ n+1 $, via heads: $ P(n+1 \\to n) = \\frac{2}{5} $\n- From $ n-1 $, via tails: $ P(n-1 \\to n) = \\frac{2}{5} $\n- From anywhere else? Only if someone jumps to 0, but that only goes to 0, not to $ n \\ne 0 $. So only neighbors contribute.\n\nThus, for $ n \\ne 0 $:\n\n$$\n\\pi_n = \\frac{2}{5} \\pi_{n-1} + \\frac{2}{5} \\pi_{n+1}\n$$\n\nWait — careful: the equation is:\n\n$$\n\\pi_n = \\sum_m \\pi_m P(m \\to n)\n$$\n\nSo to get to $ n $, you must come from:\n\n- $ m = n+1 $, and toss heads → move left to $ n $: $ P(n+1 \\to n) = \\frac{2}{5} $\n- $ m = n-1 $, and toss tails → move right to $ n $: $ P(n-1 \\to n) = \\frac{2}{5} $\n- Also, could you come from any $ m $ via edge? No — edge always goes to 0, so only contributes to $ \\pi_0 $.\n\nSo yes, for $ n \\ne 0 $:\n\n$$\n\\pi_n = \\frac{2}{5} \\pi_{n-1} + \\frac{2}{5} \\pi_{n+1}\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n$$\n5 \\pi_n = 2 \\pi_{n-1} + 2 \\pi_{n+1}\n$$\n\nRearrange:\n\n$$\n2 \\pi_{n+1} - 5 \\pi_n + 2 \\pi_{n-1} = 0\n$$\n\nThis is a linear homogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nAssume solution $ \\pi_n = A r^{|n|} $, due to symmetry: $ \\pi_n = \\pi_{-n} $. So for $ n > 0 $, let $ \\pi_n = a r^n $, where $ 0 < r < 1 $.\n\nPlug into recurrence for $ n \\ge 2 $ (so $ n-1 \\ge 1 $, all terms positive indices):\n\nLet $ \\pi_n = a r^n $, then:\n\n- $ \\pi_{n+1} = a r^{n+1} $\n- $ \\pi_{n-1} = a r^{n-1} $\n\nPlug in:\n\n$$\n2 a r^{n+1} - 5 a r^n + 2 a r^{n-1} = 0\n$$\n\nDivide by $ a r^{n-1} $ (nonzero):\n\n$$\n2 r^{2} - 5 r + 2 = 0\n$$\n\nYes! Characteristic equation:\n\n$$\n2r^2 - 5r + 2 = 0\n$$\n\nSolve:\n\nDiscriminant: $ D = 25 - 16 = 9 $, so\n\n$$\nr = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{4} = \\frac{5 \\pm 3}{4}\n\\Rightarrow r = \\frac{8}{4} = 2,\\quad r = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nSince we need $ r < 1 $, pick $ r = \\frac{1}{2} $.\n\nSo $ r = \\frac{1}{2} $.\n\nThen $ e = r + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 $.\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **5**.\n\nBut wait — double-check recurrence setup.\n\nWe used:\n\n$$\n\\pi_n = \\frac{2}{5}\\pi_{n-1} + \\frac{2}{5}\\pi_{n+1}\n$$\n\nIs this correct?\n\nLet’s verify with small $ n $, say $ n = 1 $:\n\nWho goes to 1?\n\n- From 0: tails → 0→1 with prob $ \\frac{2}{5} $\n- From 2: heads → 2→1 with prob $ \\frac{2}{5} $\n- From any other $ m $: only possible via edge → 0, so no.\n\nSo yes: $ \\pi_1 = \\frac{2}{5}\\pi_0 + \\frac{2}{5}\\pi_2 $\n\nSimilarly, for $ n = 2 $: $ \\pi_2 = \\frac{2}{5}\\pi_1 + \\frac{2}{5}\\pi_3 $\n\nSo for $ n \\ge 1 $, the recurrence is:\n\n$$\n\\pi_n = \\frac{2}{5}\\pi_{n-1} + \\frac{2}{5}\\pi_{n+1} \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 2\n$$\n\nBut for $ n = 1 $, it's different because $ \\pi_{n-1} = \\pi_0 $, which is special (not following geometric decay). So the recurrence $ 2\\pi_{n+1} - 5\\pi_n + 2\\pi_{n-1} = 0 $ holds for $ n \\ge 2 $, and the characteristic equation still gives the ratio between successive terms for $ n \\ge 2 $, i.e., $ \\pi_{n+1}/\\pi_n = r $ constant for $ n \\ge 1 $ if geometric tail.\n\nIndeed, assuming $ \\pi_n = C r^n $ for $ n \\ge 1 $, then plugging into recurrence for $ n \\ge 2 $ yields same quadratic. So $ r = \\frac{1}{2} $ is correct.\n\nThus $ e = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{9}{2} = 5 $.\n\n✅ Problem 1 answer: **5**\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> Let $ Z $ be as in problem 15. Let $ X $ be the greatest integer such that $ |X Z| \\leq 5 $. Find $ X $.\n\nBut problem 15 is not provided! So we must infer what $ Z $ is.\n\nGiven context: This is likely from a known problem set — perhaps an AMC/AIME-style problem where “problem 15” defines $ Z $. Since it's not given, maybe $ Z $ is defined in Problem 1? But Problem 1 has no $ Z $.\n\nWait — maybe “Z” refers to the random variable representing Mr. Fat’s position? But then $ |X Z| \\le 5 $ doesn’t make sense without distribution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe “Z” is standard normal? But no context.\n\nHold on — perhaps this is a trick: In many contexts, especially in problems paired like this, “Z” might refer to the **partition function**, or maybe “Z” is the **expected return time** or something from Problem 1.\n\nBut Problem 1 asks for fraction of time at 0 — i.e., stationary probability $ \\pi_0 $. Maybe $ Z = \\pi_0 $? Then $ X = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{5}{\\pi_0} \\right\\rfloor $, since $ |X Z| \\le 5 \\implies X \\le 5/Z $, greatest integer X is floor(5/Z).\n\nSo maybe we need $ \\pi_0 $.\n\nLet’s compute stationary distribution fully for Problem 1, to get $ \\pi_0 $, then see.\n\nWe have states $ \\dots, -2,-1,0,1,2,\\dots $\n\nBy symmetry: $ \\pi_{-n} = \\pi_n $. Let $ \\pi_0 = a $, and for $ n \\ge 1 $, $ \\pi_n = b r^n $, with $ r = \\frac{1}{2} $, so $ \\pi_n = b \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n $.\n\nSo total sum:\n\n$$\n\\pi_0 + 2 \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\pi_n = a + 2 \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty b \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n = a + 2b \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1/2}{1 - 1/2} \\right) = a + 2b \\cdot (1) = a + 2b = 1\n$$\n\nSo $ a + 2b = 1 $. (Eq 1)\n\nNow use balance at state 0:\n\n$$\n\\pi_0 = \\sum_m \\pi_m P(m \\to 0)\n$$\n\nWho goes to 0?\n\n- From any $ m $, via edge: $ P(m \\to 0) = \\frac{1}{5} $, for all $ m $. So total inflow to 0 from edge is $ \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_m \\pi_m = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{5} $\n\n- Also, can you get to 0 from neighbors via regular moves?\n\nYes: from 1, via heads → 1→0; from −1, via tails → −1→0.\n\nSo:\n\n- $ P(1 \\to 0) = \\frac{2}{5} $\n- $ P(-1 \\to 0) = \\frac{2}{5} $\n\nSo additional inflow: $ \\frac{2}{5} \\pi_1 + \\frac{2}{5} \\pi_{-1} = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot 2 \\pi_1 = \\frac{4}{5} \\pi_1 $\n\nThus:\n\n$$\n\\pi_0 = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{4}{5} \\pi_1\n$$\n\nBut $ \\pi_1 = b r^1 = b \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{b}{2} $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\na = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{b}{2} = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{2b}{5} = \\frac{1 + 2b}{5}\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n$$\n5a = 1 + 2b \\quad \\text{(Eq 2)}\n$$\n\nFrom Eq 1: $ a = 1 - 2b $. Plug into Eq 2:\n\n$$\n5(1 - 2b) = 1 + 2b \\\\\n5 - 10b = 1 + 2b \\\\\n5 - 1 = 10b + 2b \\\\\n4 = 12b \\Rightarrow b = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\nThen $ a = 1 - 2b = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} $\n\nSo $ \\pi_0 = \\frac{1}{3} $, and $ \\pi_n = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n $ for $ n \\ge 1 $, and symmetric.\n\nCheck: $ \\pi_0 = 1/3 $, $ \\pi_1 = 1/6 $, $ \\pi_2 = 1/12 $, etc.\n\nSum: $ \\frac{1}{3} + 2(\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{24} + \\dots) = \\frac{1}{3} + 2 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1/6}{1 - 1/2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 1 $. Good.\n\nSo stationary prob at 0 is $ \\frac{1}{3} $.\n\nBut does that help with Problem 2? It says “Let $ Z $ be as in problem 15”. Since problem 15 isn’t here, maybe in original source, problem 15 defines $ Z $ as the stationary probability at 0? Or maybe $ Z = \\pi_0 = \\frac{1}{3} $. Then $ |X Z| \\le 5 \\implies |X| \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\le 5 \\implies |X| \\le 15 $, so greatest integer $ X = 15 $.\n\nBut “greatest integer such that $ |X Z| \\le 5 $” — if $ Z > 0 $, then $ X $ can be positive or negative, but “greatest integer” means largest possible integer X satisfying inequality. Since $ |X Z| \\le 5 $, then $ -5/Z \\le X \\le 5/Z $, so max integer X is $ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{5}{Z} \\right\\rfloor $.\n\nIf $ Z = \\pi_0 = \\frac{1}{3} $, then $ \\frac{5}{Z} = 15 $, so $ X = 15 $.\n\nAlternatively, maybe $ Z = r = \\frac{1}{2} $, then $ 5 / (1/2) = 10 $, so $ X = 10 $.\n\nBut problem says “Let $ Z $ be as in problem 15”, and we don’t have problem 15. However, note that Problem 1 asks for $ e = r + \\frac{9}{2} = 5 $, and maybe problem 15 is a standard problem where $ Z $ is defined as the ratio $ r $, i.e., $ Z = r = \\frac{1}{2} $. Then $ X = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{5}{1/2} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 10 \\rfloor = 10 $.\n\nBut “greatest integer such that $ |X Z| \\le 5 $”: if $ Z = \\frac{1}{2} $, then $ |X| \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\le 5 \\implies |X| \\le 10 $, so greatest integer X is 10.\n\nSimilarly, if $ Z = \\frac{1}{3} $, X = 15.\n\nWhich is more plausible?\n\nLet’s see the expression: “Let $ X $ be the greatest integer such that $ |X Z| \\leq 5 $.” This is equivalent to $ X = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{5}{|Z|} \\right\\rfloor $, assuming $ Z > 0 $.\n\nNow, in Problem 1, we found $ r = \\frac{1}{2} $, and $ r $ is a natural candidate for $ Z $, especially since problem says “Let $ Z $ be as in problem 15”, and problem 1 involves deriving $ r $, so maybe problem 15 is identical or similar and defines $ Z = r $.\n\nAlso, $ r = \\frac{1}{2} $ is simple, and leads to integer $ X = 10 $.\n\nAlternatively, maybe $ Z = e = 5 $, then $ |5X| \\le 5 \\implies |X| \\le 1 $, so $ X = 1 $. But that seems too trivial.\n\nOr $ Z = $ expected return time to 0? In Markov chains, expected return time = $ 1/\\pi_0 = 3 $. Then $ X = \\lfloor 5 / 3 \\rfloor = 1 $. Still small.\n\nBut “greatest integer X such that $ |X Z| \\le 5 $” — if Z were large, X would be small; if Z small, X large.\n\nGiven no info, but the problem is paired with Problem 1, and Problem 1 prominently features $ r = \\frac{1}{2} $, and the prompt says “derived from the balance equations for the long-run proportions at non-zero positions”, and $ r $ is that decay factor — it's very likely that $ Z = r = \\frac{1}{2} $.\n\nHence $ X = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{5}{1/2} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 10 \\rfloor = 10 $.\n\nAlso, $ |10 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}| = 5 \\le 5 $, and $ |11 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}| = 5.5 > 5 $, so yes, 10 is greatest integer.\n\nThus answer to Problem 2 is **10**.\n\n✅ So final answers:\n\n- Problem 1: 5  \n- Problem 2: 10\n\n---\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The stationary distribution for positions n ≠ 0 satisfies the recurrence 2π_{n+1} − 5π_n + 2π_{n−1} = 0.
