  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n**Given:**\n- Tetrahedron $ABCD$ has volume $V = 1$.\n- $AB = AC = AD = 2$: So $A$ is equidistant from $B, C, D$, i.e., $B, C, D$ lie on a sphere centered at $A$ with radius 2.\n- $BC \\cdot CD \\cdot DB = 16$.\n- Let $AX$ be the altitude from $A$ to plane $BCD$. So $X$ is foot of perpendicular from $A$ to plane $BCD$.\n- Define $\\delta = AX - \\frac{7}{10}$. We need to compute $\\delta$.\n\nSo essentially, we need to find the height $h = AX$, then subtract $0.7$.\n\nRecall volume of tetrahedron:\n$$\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (\\text{area of base } \\triangle BCD) \\cdot h\n$$\nGiven $V = 1$, so:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot [\\triangle BCD] \\cdot h \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad [\\triangle BCD] = \\frac{3}{h}\n$$\n\nAlso, since $AB = AC = AD = 2$, point $A$ lies on the line perpendicular to plane $BCD$ through its circumcenter? Not necessarily — but the set of points equidistant to $B,C,D$ is the line perpendicular to plane $BCD$ through the circumcenter of triangle $BCD$. So yes: Since $AB = AC = AD$, point $A$ lies on the line through the circumcenter $O'$ of $\\triangle BCD$, perpendicular to the plane. So the foot $X$ of the perpendicular from $A$ to plane $BCD$ is exactly the circumcenter $O'$ of triangle $BCD$.\n\nThus, $X = O'$, and $AX = h$ is the distance from $A$ to circumcenter of $\\triangle BCD$. Also, since $AB = AC = AD = 2$, by definition of circumradius $R_{\\triangle}$ of triangle $BCD$, we have for each vertex:\n$$\nAB^2 = AX^2 + XB^2 = h^2 + R_{\\triangle}^2 = 4\n\\Rightarrow R_{\\triangle}^2 = 4 - h^2\n$$\n\nSo the circumradius $R$ of triangle $BCD$ satisfies $R^2 = 4 - h^2$.\n\nAlso, area of triangle $BCD$ can be expressed via sides $a = BC$, $b = CD$, $c = DB$, and circumradius $R$:\n$$\n[\\triangle BCD] = \\frac{abc}{4R}\n$$\n\nWe’re told $abc = BC \\cdot CD \\cdot DB = 16$, so:\n$$\n[\\triangle BCD] = \\frac{16}{4R} = \\frac{4}{R}\n$$\n\nBut earlier we had $[\\triangle BCD] = \\frac{3}{h}$. So:\n$$\n\\frac{4}{R} = \\frac{3}{h} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad R = \\frac{4h}{3}\n$$\n\nNow recall $R^2 = 4 - h^2$, so:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{4h}{3}\\right)^2 = 4 - h^2 \\\\\n\\frac{16h^2}{9} = 4 - h^2 \\\\\n\\frac{16h^2}{9} + h^2 = 4 \\\\\n\\frac{16h^2 + 9h^2}{9} = 4 \\\\\n\\frac{25h^2}{9} = 4 \\\\\n25h^2 = 36 \\\\\nh^2 = \\frac{36}{25} \\\\\nh = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2\n$$\n\n(Since height is positive.)\n\nThen $\\delta = h - \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{6}{5} - \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{12}{10} - \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\nWe are given triangle $ABC$ with vertices:\n\n- $A = (0, 0)$\n- $B = (200, 100)$\n- $C = (30, 330)$\n\nWe want number of integer ordered pairs $(x, y)$ such that point $\\left(x + \\frac{1}{2},\\; y + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ lies **strictly inside** triangle $ABC$.\n\nThat is, the point is the center of the unit square with lower-left corner $(x, y)$. So this is counting the number of unit squares (with integer-coordinate corners) whose centers lie strictly inside triangle $ABC$. Equivalently, it's the number of integer lattice points $(x, y)$ such that the open unit square $(x, x+1) \\times (y, y+1)$ intersects triangle $ABC$ *at its center* — but more directly, it's just shifting the triangle: define region $T = \\{ (u,v) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : (u,v) \\in \\text{int}(ABC) \\}$. Then count integer $(x,y)$ such that $(x+0.5, y+0.5) \\in T$. That’s same as counting integer points in the set $T - (0.5, 0.5)$, i.e., shift triangle $ABC$ by $(-0.5, -0.5)$, then count integer points strictly inside the shifted triangle.\n\nBut perhaps easier: This is a classic application of **Pick’s Theorem**, but Pick’s theorem counts integer points *inside* and *on boundary* of a lattice polygon. However, our points are not the integer lattice points themselves, but half-integer points $(x+0.5, y+0.5)$. So define new lattice: let $u = x + 0.5$, $v = y + 0.5$, so $(u,v)$ runs over the “half-integer” lattice: all points with both coordinates half-integers (i.e., in $\\mathbb{Z} + \\frac{1}{2}$). So we want number of half-integer points strictly inside triangle $ABC$.\n\nLet’s make change of variables: Let $u = x + \\frac{1}{2}, v = y + \\frac{1}{2}$. Then $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ iff $(u,v) \\in \\left(\\mathbb{Z} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2$. So problem reduces to: How many points of the lattice $\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{Z}^2$ (i.e., points with both coordinates half-integers) lie strictly inside triangle $ABC$?\n\nThis is equivalent to scaling up by factor 2: define $u' = 2u$, $v' = 2v$, then $(u', v') \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$, and condition becomes: $(u', v')$ lies strictly inside triangle $A'B'C'$, where $A' = 2A = (0,0)$, $B' = 2B = (400, 200)$, $C' = 2C = (60, 660)$. Because scaling preserves strict interiority.\n\nIndeed: $(u,v) \\in \\text{int}(ABC) \\iff (2u,2v) \\in \\text{int}(2\\cdot ABC) = \\text{int}(A'B'C')$.\n\nSo number of half-integer points inside $ABC$ equals number of integer points inside triangle $A'B'C'$.\n\nSo now problem reduces to: Count integer lattice points strictly inside triangle with vertices:\n\n- $A' = (0, 0)$\n- $B' = (400, 200)$\n- $C' = (60, 660)$\n\nLet’s denote this triangle as $T'$.\n\nWe can apply **Pick’s Theorem**: For a simple lattice polygon,\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = I + \\frac{B}{2} - 1\n$$\n\nwhere $I$ = number of interior lattice points, $B$ = number of boundary lattice points.\n\nSo $I = \\text{Area} - \\frac{B}{2} + 1$\n\nSo we need:\n\n- Area of triangle $A'B'C'$\n- Number $B$ of lattice points on the boundary (i.e., on edges $A'B'$, $B'C'$, $C'A'$)\n\n---\n\n#### Step 1: Compute area of triangle $A'B'C'$\n\nUsing shoelace formula:\n\nVertices in order: $A'(0,0), B'(400,200), C'(60,660)$\n\nShoelace sum:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_1)| \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2} |0\\cdot200 + 400\\cdot660 + 60\\cdot0 - (0\\cdot400 + 200\\cdot60 + 660\\cdot0)| \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2} |0 + 264000 + 0 - (0 + 12000 + 0)| \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2} |264000 - 12000| = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 252000 = 126000\n$$\n\nSo area = 126000.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 2: Count boundary lattice points $B$\n\nFor a segment between two lattice points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, number of lattice points on the segment including endpoints is:\n\n$$\n\\gcd(|x_2 - x_1|, |y_2 - y_1|) + 1\n$$\n\nSo compute for each edge:\n\n- Edge $A'B'$: from $(0,0)$ to $(400,200)$  \n  $\\Delta x = 400$, $\\Delta y = 200$, $\\gcd(400,200) = 200$  \n  So points = $200 + 1 = 201$\n\n- Edge $B'C'$: from $(400,200)$ to $(60,660)$  \n  $\\Delta x = |60 - 400| = 340$, $\\Delta y = |660 - 200| = 460$  \n  $\\gcd(340, 460)$: compute  \n  $340 = 2^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 17$  \n  $460 = 2^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 23$  \n  So $\\gcd = 2^2 \\cdot 5 = 20$  \n  So points = $20 + 1 = 21$\n\n- Edge $C'A'$: from $(60,660)$ to $(0,0)$  \n  $\\Delta x = 60$, $\\Delta y = 660$, $\\gcd(60,660)$  \n  $660 = 11 \\cdot 60$, so $\\gcd = 60$  \n  So points = $60 + 1 = 61$\n\nBut vertices are counted twice (each vertex belongs to two edges), so total boundary points:\n\n$$\nB = (201 + 21 + 61) - 3 = 283 - 3 = 280\n$$\n\nBecause each of the 3 vertices was counted in two edges, so subtract 3 duplicates.\n\n✅ So $B = 280$\n\n---\n\n#### Step 3: Apply Pick’s Theorem\n\n$$\nI = \\text{Area} - \\frac{B}{2} + 1 = 126000 - \\frac{280}{2} + 1 = 126000 - 140 + 1 = 125861\n$$\n\nSo number of interior integer lattice points in triangle $A'B'C'$ is $125861$. Therefore, number of half-integer points $(x+0.5, y+0.5)$ strictly inside original triangle $ABC$ is also $125861$.\n\nHence answer to Problem 2 is $125861$.\n\nWait — double-check arithmetic:\n\n- Area = 126000 ✔  \n- $B = 201 + 21 + 61 = 283$, minus 3 duplicates → 280 ✔  \n- $B/2 = 140$  \n- $126000 - 140 = 125860$, plus 1 = 125861 ✔\n\nYes.\n\n✅ So answer is 125861.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n- Problem 1: $\\delta = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Problem 2: $125861$\n\nNow format as JSON.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Using volume formula V = (1/3)*[BCD]*h = 1, and expressing [BCD] via abc/(4R) = 16/(4R) = 4/R, and relating R to h via AB^2 = h^2 + R^2 = 4, we solved to get h = 6/5, so delta = h - 7/10 = 1/2. Problem 2: The condition (x+1/2, y+1/2) in interior of triangle ABC is equivalent to counting integer points inside triangle A'B'C' obtained by scaling ABC by factor 2. Using shoelace, area = 126000. Boundary points computed via gcd on each edge: A'B' has gcd(400,200)=200 => 201 points; B'C' gcd(340,460)=20 => 21 points; C'A' gcd(60,660)=60 => 61 points; total boundary points B = 201+21+61-3 = 280. By Pick's theorem, interior points I = area - B/2 + 1 = 126000 - 140 + 1 = 125861.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"125861\"\n}",
