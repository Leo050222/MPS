  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> A group of 101 Dalmathians participate in an election, where they each vote independently on either candidate $A$ or $B$ with equal probability. If $X$ Dalmathians voted for the winning candidate, the expected value of $X^{2}$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for positive integers $a, b$ with $\\gcd(a, b)=1$. Find the unique positive integer $k \\leq 103$ such that $103 \\mid a-bk$. Instead of determining the specified integer related to the expected value of the square of the number voting for the winning candidate, simply find $r = P(\\textrm{same}) + \\frac{3}{2}$, where $P(\\textrm{same})$ is the probability that two voters vote for the same candidate derived from the independence of their votes.\n\nWait — the problem says: *“Instead of determining the specified integer … simply find $ r = P(\\text{same}) + \\frac{3}{2} $”*.\n\nSo we don’t need to compute the expected value of $ X^2 $, nor find $ a, b, k $. We just need:\n\n- Compute $ P(\\text{same}) $: probability that two randomly chosen (independent) voters vote for the same candidate.\n\nEach voter chooses $ A $ or $ B $ independently with equal probability: $ \\Pr(A) = \\Pr(B) = \\frac{1}{2} $.\n\nSo for two independent voters:\n\n$$\nP(\\text{same}) = P(\\text{both } A) + P(\\text{both } B) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nr = P(\\text{same}) + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n$$\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **2**.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> Find all possible values of $ \\frac{d}{a} $ where $ a^{2} - 6 a d + 8 d^{2} = 0 $, $ a \\ne 0 $.\n\nWe are to solve for ratio $ \\frac{d}{a} $. Let $ r = \\frac{d}{a} $. Since $ a \\ne 0 $, this is valid.\n\nThen $ d = r a $. Plug into equation:\n\n$$\na^2 - 6a (r a) + 8 (r a)^2 = 0 \\\\\na^2 - 6 r a^2 + 8 r^2 a^2 = 0\n$$\n\nFactor $ a^2 $ (nonzero):\n\n$$\na^2 (1 - 6r + 8r^2) = 0 \\Rightarrow 1 - 6r + 8r^2 = 0\n$$\n\nSolve quadratic:\n\n$$\n8r^2 - 6r + 1 = 0\n$$\n\nUse quadratic formula:\n\n$$\nr = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 1}}{2 \\cdot 8} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 32}}{16} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{4}}{16} = \\frac{6 \\pm 2}{16}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n- $ r = \\frac{6 + 2}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} $\n- $ r = \\frac{6 - 2}{16} = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4} $\n\nThus possible values of $ \\frac{d}{a} $ are $ \\frac{1}{4} $ and $ \\frac{1}{2} $.\n\nThe problem says “Find all possible values”, so answer should list both.\n\nBut how to format? As a set? The instructions say: “put ONLY the answer value in the quotes”, and “for numerical answers, provide the exact value”.\n\nSince there are two values, likely as a list or comma-separated? But the JSON expects a single value per key.\n\nLet’s check wording again: “Find all possible values of $ \\frac{d}{a} $”. So answer is a set: $ \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\} $. But JSON doesn’t support sets natively; common practice is to use a list.\n\nAlso, the example shows `\"answer_2\": \"Monday\"` — i.e., string. But here it's numbers.\n\nWe can write as a list: `[\"1/4\", \"1/2\"]`? Or as a sorted list of fractions.\n\nBut instruction says: “For numerical answers, provide the exact value”. Since there are two, perhaps comma-separated string? Let's see if problem expects multivalued answer.\n\nLooking at standard contest math problems like this, often answers are listed in increasing order, separated by commas, inside quotes.\n\nE.g., `\"1/4, 1/2\"`\n\nYes — that’s common.\n\nAlso, note: both are rational, reduced.\n\nSo answer is `\"1/4, 1/2\"`\n\n✅\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers:\n\n- Problem 1: `2`\n- Problem 2: `\"1/4, 1/2\"`\n\nNow write reasoning and JSON.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Each voter chooses A or B independently with probability 1/2. For two voters, P(same) = P(both A) + P(both B) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1/2. Then r = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2. Problem 2: Let r = d/a. Substituting d = ra into the equation gives a^2(1 - 6r + 8r^2) = 0. Since a ≠ 0, solve 8r^2 - 6r + 1 = 0. Using quadratic formula yields r = (6 ± √(36 - 32))/16 = (6 ± 2)/16 → r = 1/2 or 1/4.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/4, 1/2\"\n}",
