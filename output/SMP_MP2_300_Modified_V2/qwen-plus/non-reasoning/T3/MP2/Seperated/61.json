There are four complex values of $k$ for which the polynomial $Q(x)=x^{4}-k x^{3}-x^{2}-x-45$ is quirky. Compute the product of these four values of $k$.\n\nLet the roots be $a, b, c, d$, all distinct complex numbers.\n\nGiven: $Q(x) = x^4 - k x^3 - x^2 - x - 45$\n\nBy Vieta’s formulas for monic quartic $x^4 + p x^3 + q x^2 + r x + s$, sum of roots = $-p$. Here, coefficient of $x^3$ is $-k$, so:\n\n- $a + b + c + d = k$  (since $-(-k) = k$)\n\nAlso:\n- Sum of pairwise products: $ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = -1$\n- Sum of triple products: $abc + abd + acd + bcd = 1$ (since coefficient of $x$ is $-1$, and Vieta says sum of triple products = $-$(coefficient of $x$) = $-(-1) = 1$)\n- Product of roots: $abcd = -45$ (since constant term is $-45$, and for monic quartic, product = $(-1)^4 \\cdot (\\text{constant term}) = -45$)\n\nNow, “quirky” means one root equals sum of the other three.\n\nWithout loss of generality, suppose:\n\n$$\nd = a + b + c\n$$\n\nThen total sum:\n\n$$\na + b + c + d = a + b + c + (a + b + c) = 2(a + b + c) = k \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a + b + c = \\frac{k}{2}, \\quad d = \\frac{k}{2}\n$$\n\nSo all roots expressed in terms of $k$: $a,b,c$ are roots satisfying $a+b+c = k/2$, and $d = k/2$.\n\nAlso, since $d = a+b+c$, then $a+b+c-d = 0$. So the elementary symmetric sums can be rewritten.\n\nLet’s define:\n\nLet $S_1 = a + b + c + d = k$\n\nBut $d = a + b + c$, so $S_1 = 2(a + b + c) = k \\implies a + b + c = k/2$, as above.\n\nLet $S_2 = \\sum_{i<j} r_i r_j = ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = -1$\n\nLet’s compute $S_2$ in terms of $a,b,c$ only, using $d = a+b+c$.\n\nCompute:\n\n- $ab + ac + bc$ → call this $P_2$\n- $ad = a(a+b+c) = a^2 + ab + ac$\n- $bd = b(a+b+c) = ab + b^2 + bc$\n- $cd = c(a+b+c) = ac + bc + c^2$\n\nSo sum of all pairwise products:\n\n$$\nS_2 = ab + ac + bc + [a^2 + ab + ac] + [ab + b^2 + bc] + [ac + bc + c^2]\n$$\n\nGroup terms:\n\n- $ab$: appears in $ab$, then in $ad$, $bd$: total count = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n- $ac$: appears in $ac$, $ad$, $cd$: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n- $bc$: appears in $bc$, $bd$, $cd$: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n- $a^2$: from $ad$\n- $b^2$: from $bd$\n- $c^2$: from $cd$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nS_2 = 3(ab + ac + bc) + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)\n$$\n\nBut $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + ac + bc) = \\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\right)^2 - 2P_2$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nS_2 = 3P_2 + \\left[\\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\right)^2 - 2P_2\\right] = P_2 + \\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\right)^2\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\nP_2 = S_2 - \\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\right)^2 = -1 - \\frac{k^2}{4}\n$$\n\nSo $ab + ac + bc = -1 - \\frac{k^2}{4}$\n\nNow consider sum of triple products:\n\n$$\nS_3 = abc + abd + acd + bcd = abc + ab(a+b+c) + ac(a+b+c) + bc(a+b+c)\n$$\n\nFactor:\n\n- $abd = ab d = ab(a+b+c)$\n- $acd = ac d = ac(a+b+c)$\n- $bcd = bc d = bc(a+b+c)$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nS_3 = abc + (ab + ac + bc)(a + b + c) = abc + P_2 \\cdot \\frac{k}{2}\n$$\n\nBut $S_3 = 1$ (from Vieta), so:\n\n$$\nabc + P_2 \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = 1\n$$\n\nSubstitute $P_2 = -1 - \\frac{k^2}{4}$:\n\n$$\nabc + \\left(-1 - \\frac{k^2}{4}\\right)\\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = 1\n$$\n\nCompute second term:\n\n$$\n\\left(-1 - \\frac{k^2}{4}\\right)\\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = -\\frac{k}{2} - \\frac{k^3}{8}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nabc = 1 + \\frac{k}{2} + \\frac{k^3}{8}\n$$\n\nNow product of all four roots:\n\n$$\nabcd = abc \\cdot d = abc \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = -45\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\left(1 + \\frac{k}{2} + \\frac{k^3}{8}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = -45\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\nLeft side:\n\n$$\n\\left(1 + \\frac{k}{2} + \\frac{k^3}{8}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = \\frac{k}{2} + \\frac{k^2}{4} + \\frac{k^4}{16}\n$$\n\nMultiply entire equation by 16:\n\n$$\n16 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{k}{2} + \\frac{k^2}{4} + \\frac{k^4}{16} \\right) = 16 \\cdot (-45)\n$$\n\nCompute LHS:\n\n- $16 \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = 8k$\n- $16 \\cdot \\frac{k^2}{4} = 4k^2$\n- $16 \\cdot \\frac{k^4}{16} = k^4$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nk^4 + 4k^2 + 8k = -720\n$$\n\nBring all to one side:\n\n$$\nk^4 + 4k^2 + 8k + 720 = 0\n$$\n\nWait — check sign: RHS was $-45$, multiplied by 16 gives $-720$, so moving to LHS gives $+720$. Yes.\n\nSo the equation satisfied by $k$ is:\n\n$$\nk^4 + 4k^2 + 8k + 720 = 0\n$$\n\nBut hold on — is this correct? Let's double-check algebra.\n\nWe had:\n\n$$\nabcd = abc \\cdot d = abc \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = -45\n$$\n\nAnd:\n\n$$\nabc = 1 + \\frac{k}{2} + \\frac{k^3}{8}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\left(1 + \\frac{k}{2} + \\frac{k^3}{8}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = -45\n$$\n\nCompute LHS carefully:\n\nDistribute:\n\n- $1 \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = \\frac{k}{2}$\n- $\\frac{k}{2} \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = \\frac{k^2}{4}$\n- $\\frac{k^3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = \\frac{k^4}{16}$\n\nYes, so:\n\n$$\n\\frac{k^4}{16} + \\frac{k^2}{4} + \\frac{k}{2} = -45\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by 16:\n\n$$\nk^4 + 4k^2 + 8k = -720\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nk^4 + 4k^2 + 8k + 720 = 0\n$$\n\nThat's a quartic in $k$. The problem says there are **four complex values of $k$** for which $Q$ is quirky — i.e., this equation has four roots (counting multiplicity), and they’re distinct? Not specified, but we’re to compute the **product** of the four values of $k$.\n\nFor monic quartic $k^4 + a k^3 + b k^2 + c k + d = 0$, product of roots = $d$ if degree even and leading coefficient 1, with sign $(-1)^4 d = d$.\n\nOur polynomial is:\n\n$$\nk^4 + 0\\cdot k^3 + 4k^2 + 8k + 720 = 0\n$$\n\nSo product of roots = constant term = **720**\n\nBUT — wait! Is this polynomial correct? Let's sanity-check.\n\nWe assumed $d = a+b+c$. But the condition is \"one of which is the sum of the other three\". There are 4 choices for which root is the sum: could be $a = b+c+d$, etc. However, due to symmetry, each case would lead to same equation? Or does our derivation already account for all possibilities?\n\nActually, no — our derivation assumed $d = a+b+c$, but the condition doesn’t specify which root is the sum. So perhaps the full set of $k$ satisfying quirky condition corresponds to union over all 4 choices. But the problem says \"there are four complex values of $k$\" — implying the equation we get is degree 4, and those are the four $k$'s.\n\nOur derived equation is degree 4, monic, constant term 720 ⇒ product = 720.\n\nBut let’s verify with an alternative approach.\n\nAlternative method:\n\nLet roots be $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4$, distinct, and suppose $r_4 = r_1 + r_2 + r_3$. Then as before, sum $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 = 2(r_1 + r_2 + r_3) = k$, so $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = k/2$, $r_4 = k/2$.\n\nSo one root is $k/2$. Therefore, $x = k/2$ is a root of $Q(x)$. So $Q(k/2) = 0$.\n\nThat’s a key insight! Since one root equals sum of other three, and total sum is $k$, then that root must be $k/2$. So $k/2$ is a root.\n\nSo for $Q$ to be quirky, it must have $k/2$ as a root.\n\nSo plug $x = k/2$ into $Q(x)$:\n\n$$\nQ\\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\right)^4 - k \\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\right)^3 - \\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\right) - 45 = 0\n$$\n\nCompute each term:\n\n- $(k/2)^4 = k^4 / 16$\n- $k (k/2)^3 = k \\cdot k^3 / 8 = k^4 / 8$\n- $(k/2)^2 = k^2 / 4$\n- $k/2$\n- constant $-45$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\frac{k^4}{16} - \\frac{k^4}{8} - \\frac{k^2}{4} - \\frac{k}{2} - 45 = 0\n$$\n\nCompute $\\frac{k^4}{16} - \\frac{k^4}{8} = \\frac{k^4}{16} - \\frac{2k^4}{16} = -\\frac{k^4}{16}$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n-\\frac{k^4}{16} - \\frac{k^2}{4} - \\frac{k}{2} - 45 = 0\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by $-1$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{k^4}{16} + \\frac{k^2}{4} + \\frac{k}{2} + 45 = 0\n$$\n\nNow multiply by 16:\n\n$$\nk^4 + 4k^2 + 8k + 720 = 0\n$$\n\nSame equation! ✅ So this confirms correctness.\n\nTherefore, the four values of $k$ are the four roots of this quartic, and since it's monic, the product is the constant term: **720**\n\nBUT — careful: For monic polynomial $k^4 + a k^3 + b k^2 + c k + d = 0$, product of roots is $d$ when degree is even? Actually, yes: for polynomial $\\prod_{i=1}^4 (k - r_i) = k^4 - (\\sum r_i)k^3 + \\dots + (-1)^4 r_1 r_2 r_3 r_4 = k^4 + \\dots + (r_1 r_2 r_3 r_4)$. So constant term = product of roots.\n\nOur polynomial is $k^4 + 0k^3 + 4k^2 + 8k + 720$, so product = **720**\n\n✅ Answer for Problem 2 is **720**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers:\n\n- Problem 1: $ \\binom{6}{3} - 16 = 20 - 16 = 4 $\n- Problem 2: product of four $k$ values = 720\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Compute binomial coefficient C(6,3) = 20, then subtract 16 to get 4. Problem 2: For Q to be quirky, one root equals sum of other three; using Vieta's formulas and the condition, we deduce that k/2 must be a root of Q, leading to the equation k^4 + 4k^2 + 8k + 720 = 0. Since this monic quartic has four roots (the values of k), their product equals the constant term, 720.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"720\"\n}",
