Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1 Analysis**\n\n> For any odd positive integer $ n $, let $ r(n) $ be the odd positive integer such that the binary representation of $ r(n) $ is the binary representation of $ n $ written backwards. For example, $ r(2023)=r\\left(11111100111_{2}\\right)=11100111111_{2}=1855 $. Determine, with proof, whether there exists a strictly increasing eight-term arithmetic progression $ a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{8} $ of odd positive integers such that $ r\\left(a_{1}\\right), \\ldots, r\\left(a_{8}\\right) $ is an arithmetic progression in that order. Instead of determining whether such a progression exists, simply find $ e = \\delta + 19 $, where $ \\delta $ is the binary digit in the third of three consecutive terms with equal binary length at the minimal bit position $ j \\geq 1 $ where the binary representations of the first and second of those terms differ, derived from the arithmetic progression relation among the original terms.\n\nThis problem is *not* asking us to prove existence or nonexistence — it’s asking for a specific numeric value $ e = \\delta + 19 $, defined via a very specific construction involving:\n\n- An arithmetic progression $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_8 $ of **odd** positive integers.\n- All $ a_i $ have **equal binary length**, i.e., same number of bits (so no leading zeros; since they’re odd, least significant bit is always 1).\n- Consider **three consecutive terms**, say $ a_k, a_{k+1}, a_{k+2} $, all with same binary length.\n- Let $ j \\ge 1 $ be the **minimal bit position** (counting from right? left? need to clarify) where $ a_k $ and $ a_{k+1} $ differ in binary.\n- Then $ \\delta $ is the binary digit (i.e., 0 or 1) at that same position $ j $ in $ a_{k+2} $.\n- Then $ e = \\delta + 19 $.\n\nBut wait — the problem says:  \n> “...derived from the arithmetic progression relation among the original terms.”\n\nSo perhaps this is not about arbitrary APs, but about the *structure forced* by requiring both $ a_i $ and $ r(a_i) $ to be arithmetic progressions.\n\nLet’s parse carefully.\n\nWe have:\n- $ a_1, \\dots, a_8 $: odd, strictly increasing, arithmetic progression → so $ a_i = a + (i-1)d $, with $ d > 0 $, and all $ a_i $ odd ⇒ $ a $ odd, $ d $ even (since odd + even = odd; odd + odd = even → to keep all terms odd, common difference must be even).\n\n- $ r(a_i) $ also forms an arithmetic progression: $ r(a_i) = r(a) + (i-1)\\Delta $ for some $ \\Delta $.\n\nThe function $ r(n) $ reverses binary digits. So if $ n $ has binary representation $ b_m b_{m-1} \\dots b_1 b_0 $ (with $ b_0 $ LSB), then $ r(n) = b_0 b_1 \\dots b_{m-1} b_m $ interpreted as binary number (but note: leading zeros in reversed string become trailing zeros in original, but since $ n $ is odd, $ b_0 = 1 $, so reversed string ends in 1 → $ r(n) $ is also odd, good).\n\nNow, reversing bits is *not linear*, nor affine. So for $ r(a + (i-1)d) $ to be arithmetic in $ i $, extremely restrictive.\n\nIn fact, known result: The only way $ r $ maps an arithmetic progression of odd numbers of fixed bit-length to another AP is when the progression corresponds to incrementing the *reversed* bits linearly — i.e., when the $ a_i $’s binary representations are reversals of an AP — but here it's the opposite.\n\nHowever, the problem says: *Instead of determining whether such a progression exists*, just compute $ e = \\delta + 19 $, where $ \\delta $ is defined as:\n\n> “the binary digit in the third of three consecutive terms with equal binary length at the minimal bit position $ j \\ge 1 $ where the binary representations of the first and second of those terms differ, derived from the arithmetic progression relation among the original terms.”\n\nKey phrase: “derived from the arithmetic progression relation among the original terms”.\n\nSo maybe we don’t need to construct an actual AP — perhaps this is a *generic property*: for any 3-term AP of odd integers with same binary length, look at minimal bit position where first two differ, and take digit at that position in third term.\n\nLet’s test with smallest possible such triple.\n\nLet’s pick smallest odd integers with same binary length.\n\nBinary length = 1: only 1 → can’t have 3 distinct odds.\n\nLength = 2: odd numbers with 2 bits: only 3 = `11` → only one.\n\nLength = 3: 3-bit odd numbers: from `101` = 5 to `111` = 7 → 5, 7 → only two.\n\nLength = 4: 4-bit numbers: from `1001` = 9 to `1111` = 15, odd ones: 9,11,13,15 → four numbers.\n\nList them:\n\n- 9 = `1001`\n- 11 = `1011`\n- 13 = `1101`\n- 15 = `1111`\n\nAll 4-bit, odd.\n\nNow consider 3-term APs among these.\n\nCheck differences:\n\n11 − 9 = 2  \n13 − 11 = 2  \n15 − 13 = 2  \nSo full AP: 9,11,13,15 with d = 2.\n\nTake first three: a₁=9=`1001`, a₂=11=`1011`, a₃=13=`1101`.\n\nWrite binary aligned (4 bits, MSB left):\n\n- 9: `1 0 0 1`  \n- 11: `1 0 1 1`  \n- 13: `1 1 0 1`\n\nPositions: let’s define position j ≥ 1. Usually in binary, position 1 is LSB (rightmost), or MSB? The problem says “minimal bit position j ≥ 1 where binary representations of first and second differ”.\n\nIn the example: r(2023): 2023 = `11111100111₂` (11 bits), reversed → `11100111111₂`. So reversal includes all bits — no stripping leading zeros. So positions are usually indexed from right (LSB = position 1) or left?\n\nStandard in computer science: bit position often starts at 0 for LSB. But problem says j ≥ 1, so likely j = 1 is LSB.\n\nLet’s verify with 9 and 11:\n\n9 = `1001₂` = bits (from right, position 1 to 4):  \npos1 (2⁰): 1  \npos2 (2¹): 0  \npos3 (2²): 0  \npos4 (2³): 1  \n\nSo `1001` → positions:  \nj=1: 1  \nj=2: 0  \nj=3: 0  \nj=4: 1  \n\n11 = `1011₂`:  \nj=1: 1  \nj=2: 1  \nj=3: 0  \nj=4: 1  \n\nSo compare j=1: both 1 → same  \nj=2: 0 vs 1 → differ! So minimal j = 2.\n\nThen δ = binary digit of a₃ = 13 at position j = 2.\n\n13 = `1101₂`:  \nj=1: 1  \nj=2: 0  \nj=3: 1  \nj=4: 1  \n\nSo digit at j=2 is 0 → δ = 0 → e = 0 + 19 = 19.\n\nBut is this the *minimal* such triple? The problem says “at the minimal bit position j ≥ 1 where the binary representations of the first and second of those terms differ, derived from the arithmetic progression relation”.\n\nDoes “derived from the arithmetic progression relation” mean something else? Like, using that a₂ − a₁ = a₃ − a₂ = d, so a₃ = 2a₂ − a₁, and that imposes constraints on bits?\n\nLet’s compute a₃ = 2a₂ − a₁ = 2·11 − 9 = 22 − 9 = 13 — matches.\n\nNow, what is bit j=2 of a₃? We got 0.\n\nBut is there a smaller j? j=1 is same (both end in 1), so j=2 is minimal.\n\nThus δ = 0, e = 19.\n\nBut wait — the problem says “three consecutive terms with equal binary length”. In our case, all have length 4. Good.\n\nIs there any 3-term AP of odd integers with equal binary length where minimal differing position j is smaller? j=1 is impossible because all odd numbers have bit j=1 = 1, so first two always agree at j=1. So minimal possible j is 2.\n\nHence for *any* such triple of odd numbers in AP with same bit length, j=2 is minimal possible position where first two differ.\n\nThen δ is bit j=2 of third term.\n\nWhat is bit j=2 (2¹ place) of a₃ = a₁ + 2d?\n\nSince a₁ and a₂ = a₁ + d are odd, d is even. Let d = 2k.\n\nThen a₁ ≡ 1 mod 2  \na₂ = a₁ + 2k ⇒ same parity, odd.\n\nBit j=2 is the coefficient of 2¹, i.e., (n mod 4) // 2.\n\nBecause:\n- n mod 4 ∈ {1,3} for odd n.\n- If n ≡ 1 mod 4 → binary ends `01` → j=1=1, j=2=0  \n- If n ≡ 3 mod 4 → ends `11` → j=1=1, j=2=1\n\nSo bit j=2 is 0 if n ≡ 1 mod 4, 1 if n ≡ 3 mod 4.\n\nSo δ = [a₃ mod 4] // 2.\n\nNow a₁ odd, d even ⇒ let a₁ ≡ r mod 4, r ∈ {1,3}; d ≡ 0 or 2 mod 4.\n\nCase 1: d ≡ 0 mod 4 ⇒ a₂ = a₁ + d ≡ r mod 4, a₃ = a₁ + 2d ≡ r mod 4 ⇒ δ = same as a₁’s j=2 bit.\n\nBut a₁ and a₂ would agree at j=2 too ⇒ minimal j would be >2, contradicting minimality. So to have minimal j=2, we need a₁ and a₂ to differ at j=2 ⇒ a₁ ≢ a₂ mod 4 ⇒ since d even, d ≡ 2 mod 4.\n\nSo d = 2 mod 4.\n\nThen:\n- a₁ mod 4 = 1 ⇒ a₂ = 1 + 2 = 3 mod 4 ⇒ differ at j=2  \n- a₃ = a₁ + 2d = 1 + 4 = 5 ≡ 1 mod 4 ⇒ j=2 bit = 0  \n- Or a₁ ≡ 3 mod 4 ⇒ a₂ = 3 + 2 = 5 ≡ 1 mod 4 ⇒ differ  \n- a₃ = 3 + 4 = 7 ≡ 3 mod 4 ⇒ j=2 bit = 1\n\nSo δ could be 0 or 1 depending on a₁.\n\nBut problem asks for *the* value e = δ + 19, implying it's uniquely determined.\n\nPerhaps the “minimal” refers to over all possible such configurations, take the minimal possible j, and then in that case, what is δ? Since j=2 is minimal possible, and for j=2, δ depends on a₁ mod 4.\n\nBut maybe in the *smallest possible* such AP — i.e., smallest a₁, d — we get a unique δ.\n\nSmallest odd a₁: 1? But 1 is `1`, length 1. Next term a₂ = 1 + d, must be odd ⇒ d even. Smallest d = 2 ⇒ a₂ = 3 = `11`, length 2 ≠ length of 1 ⇒ unequal length.\n\nWe need equal binary length. So find smallest 3-term AP of odd integers with same bit length.\n\nAs before: length 4: 9,11,13 — works.\n\na₁ = 9 ≡ 1 mod 4 ⇒ a₃ = 13 ≡ 1 mod 4 ⇒ δ = 0.\n\nIs there a smaller-length equal-length triple? Length 3: odd numbers from 5 (`101`) to 7 (`111`): 5,7 — only two.\n\nLength 4 is minimal possible for 3-term AP of odd numbers with equal bit-length.\n\nThus minimal configuration is 9,11,13 → δ = 0 → e = 19.\n\nThus answer to Problem 1 is **19**.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> Determine the number of subsets $ S $ of $ \\{1,2,\\ldots,1000\\} $ that satisfy:\n> - $ |S| = 19 $, and  \n> - the sum of the elements in any non-empty subset of $ S $ is **not divisible by 20**.\n\nSo we need 19-element subsets S of {1,…,1000} such that **no non-empty subset of S has sum ≡ 0 mod 20**.\n\nThis is a classic problem related to the **Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem**, but that says any 2n−1 integers have a subset of n whose sum is divisible by n. Here n = 20, so EGZ says any 39 integers have a 20-element subset summing to multiple of 20 — not directly applicable.\n\nBut our condition is stronger: *no non-empty subset* (of any size) has sum divisible by 20.\n\nThat means the subset S must be **sum-free modulo 20**, i.e., its subset sums avoid 0 mod 20.\n\nLet’s denote $ A = S \\mod 20 $, i.e., residues mod 20 of elements of S.\n\nSince we care only about sums mod 20, the actual values matter only mod 20.\n\nNote: If S contains two elements congruent mod 20, say a ≡ b mod 20, then their difference is divisible by 20, but we care about *sums*, not differences. However, if we have a and b with a ≡ −b mod 20, then a + b ≡ 0 mod 20 → violates condition. So S cannot contain both x and −x mod 20 unless x ≡ 0 or x ≡ 10 (since −x ≡ x mod 20 ⇒ 2x ≡ 0 ⇒ x ≡ 0 or 10).\n\nAlso, if S contains 0 mod 20, i.e., a multiple of 20, then that single element’s sum is 0 mod 20 → forbidden. So S cannot contain any element ≡ 0 mod 20.\n\nSimilarly, if S contains 10, then 10 + 10 = 20 ≡ 0, but we can have at most one 10 (since elements of S are distinct integers, but multiple elements can be ≡ 10 mod 20 — e.g., 10,30,50,... — all ≡ 10). So if S contains two numbers ≡ 10 mod 20, their sum ≡ 20 ≡ 0 mod 20 → forbidden. So at most one element ≡ 10 mod 20.\n\nMore generally, the set of residues R = {a mod 20 : a ∈ S} must be such that no non-empty subset sum of R (with multiplicities as in S) is ≡ 0 mod 20.\n\nBut since elements of S are distinct integers, but residues can repeat. So R is a multiset of size 19 over Z/20Z \\ {0}, with constraints.\n\nTo maximize size without subset sum 0 mod 20, best is to pick all elements from a set of residues that is “sum-free” mod 20 — i.e., no subset sums to 0.\n\nA standard approach: use residues in a half-group — e.g., all in {1,2,…,9}, since sums stay < 20? No, 19 elements each ≥1 sum to ≥19, but mod 20, could wrap.\n\nBetter idea: Use only one residue r with gcd(r,20)=1, say r=1. Then subset sums are k·1 mod 20 for k=1 to 19 ⇒ sums are 1 through 19 mod 20 — none is 0. So if all elements of S are ≡ 1 mod 20, then any non-empty subset sum is k mod 20, k=1..19 ⇒ never 0. So this works.\n\nHow many numbers in {1,…,1000} are ≡ 1 mod 20? Floor((1000−1)/20)+1 = floor(999/20)+1 = 49 + 1 = 50.\n\nSo number of 19-element subsets with all elements ≡ 1 mod 20 is C(50,19).\n\nBut are there other possibilities? Yes — e.g., all ≡ 3 mod 20, same thing: sums are 3k mod 20, k=1..19. Since gcd(3,20)=1, as k runs 1..19, 3k mod 20 runs through 1..19 — no zero. So any residue r coprime to 20 works.\n\nResidues coprime to 20: φ(20) = φ(4·5) = 20·(1−1/2)(1−1/5) = 20·1/2·4/5 = 8. They are: 1,3,7,9,11,13,17,19.\n\nEach such r gives a class of numbers ≡ r mod 20 in {1,…,1000}.\n\nHow many numbers ≡ r mod 20 in [1,1000]?\n\nFor any r ∈ [1,20], count = floor((1000 − r)/20) + 1.\n\nSince 1000 = 50·20, numbers ≡ r mod 20 from 1 to 1000 are exactly 50 for each r = 1 to 20. Because 20×50 = 1000, so complete residue system repeated 50 times.\n\nIndeed: numbers ≡ r mod 20 in [1,1000] are r, r+20, ..., up to ≤1000. Max k such that r + 20(k−1) ≤ 1000 ⇒ k ≤ (1000 − r)/20 + 1. For r=1: (999)/20 +1 = 49.95 +1 → 50. For r=20: numbers 20,40,...,1000 → 50 numbers. So yes, each residue class mod 20 has exactly 50 representatives.\n\nSo for each of the 8 coprime residues, we have C(50,19) subsets where all elements are ≡ r mod 20.\n\nBut wait — are there subsets mixing residues that still avoid subset sum 0 mod 20?\n\nFor example, can we take some ≡1 and some ≡2? Then 1+2=3, fine, but maybe 1+1+...+1 (20 times) = 20 ≡ 0, but we only have 19 elements, so max sum of 1s is 19. But with mixed, could get 0 earlier.\n\nActually, the maximal size of a subset of Z/20Z with no non-empty subset summing to 0 is given by the **Davenport constant** D(G) of group G = Z/20Z.\n\nD(Z/nZ) = n. That is, any sequence of n elements in Z/nZ has a non-empty subsequence summing to 0 mod n. And n−1 may avoid it.\n\nIndeed, D(Z/nZ) = n. So any 20 elements in Z/20Z have a non-empty subset summing to 0 mod 20. Therefore, to avoid it, we can have at most 19 elements — which matches our |S| = 19.\n\nAnd extremal sequences achieving no zero-sum subset are precisely those consisting of 19 copies of a generator — i.e., all equal to some r with gcd(r,20)=1. Because if you have 19 copies of r, sums are kr mod 20, k=1..19, and since r is invertible, kr runs through 1..19 mod 20 — no zero.\n\nIf you have a mixture, say two different residues, it may create a zero-sum subset earlier.\n\nBut is it possible to have 19 elements not all same residue, yet no subset sum 0 mod 20?\n\nExample: take 19 copies of 2. gcd(2,20)=2 ≠1. Then sums are 2k mod 20, k=1..19 → values: 2,4,...,38 mod 20 = 2,4,...,18,0,2,4,... So when k=10, 2·10 = 20 ≡ 0 → violates. So cannot use r not coprime to 20.\n\nWhat about using r=10? Then each element ≡10, sum of two is 20≡0 → violates. So max one element ≡10.\n\nBut we need 19 elements — impossible to use 10.\n\nSimilarly, r=4: gcd(4,20)=4, then 5·4 = 20 ≡0, so with five 4s, sum is 0. So to avoid, can have at most 4 copies.\n\nThus only safe way to get 19 elements is to pick all from a single residue class coprime to 20.\n\nAre there other constructions? For example, using residues from {1,2,...,9} all distinct? But then you have 19 elements, but only 9 residues — must repeat. Repeats may cause issues.\n\nBut Davenport constant says maximum size without zero-sum subset is 19, achieved only by 19 copies of a generator. In cyclic group Z/nZ, the extremal zero-sum-free sequences of length n−1 are precisely the sequences with all terms equal to a fixed generator.\n\nHence the only 19-element subsets of Z/20Z with no non-empty zero-sum subset are those with all 19 elements congruent to the same r mod 20, where gcd(r,20)=1.\n\nTherefore, total number of such S is:\n\nNumber of choices for r ∈ {1,3,7,9,11,13,17,19} = 8 residues.\n\nFor each r, number of ways to choose 19 distinct integers from the 50 numbers in {1,…,1000} congruent to r mod 20 is C(50,19).\n\nSo total = 8 × C(50,19).\n\nBut wait — is that correct? Are there subsets with repeated residues but not all same, yet still zero-sum-free? Literature says for cyclic groups, the only zero-sum-free sequences of length n−1 are the \"constant\" ones with generator. Yes, that’s a known result.\n\nThus answer is $ 8 \\times \\binom{50}{19} $.\n\nBut the problem asks for the *number*, so we need to compute it? No, it's huge; likely leave as expression? But competition problems usually expect simplified form or numeric? However, C(50,19) is an integer, and 8*C(50,19) is exact.\n\nBut let’s confirm count per residue: yes, 50 numbers per residue class mod 20 in 1..1000.\n\nResidues coprime to 20: as listed, 8.\n\nSo answer is $ 8 \\times \\binom{50}{19} $.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects just that expression? However, instructions say “provide your final answers in the exact JSON format”, and “for numerical answers, provide the exact value”. But $ \\binom{50}{19} = 253724018596810 $ (we can compute or recall), then ×8.\n\nLet me compute C(50,19):\n\nC(50,19) = C(50,31), but better compute:\n\nWe can note that C(50,19) = 50! / (19! 31!)\n\nBut rather than compute manually, perhaps recognize that this is standard.\n\nActually, let me approximate or recall: C(50,10) = 10272278170, C(50,15) = 2250829575120, C(50,20) = 47129212243960, so C(50,19) = C(50,31) = C(50,19) = ?\n\nUse symmetry: C(50,19) = C(50,31), but better calculate ratio:\n\nC(50,19) = C(50,18) × (50−18)/(19) = ... too long.\n\nAlternatively, trust that answer is 8 × C(50,19), and perhaps problem expects that expression? But instructions say “exact value”, so likely compute.\n\nLet me try to compute C(50,19):\n\nWe can use known value or calculate stepwise.\n\nC(50,19) = product_{k=0 to 18} (50−k) / (19−k) = (50×49×...×32) / 19!\n\nBut instead, search known value:  \nC(50,19) = 253724018596810  \nLet me verify with smaller: C(10,3)=120, ok.\n\nActually, I can reason that this number is standard, but perhaps the answer is simply $ 8 \\times \\binom{50}{19} $, and in contest, they accept the expression. But the instruction says “exact value”, so must be integer.\n\nLet me compute using Python-like mental steps:\n\nC(50,19) = 50×49×48×47×46×45×44×43×42×41×40×39×38×37×36×35×34×33×32 / 19!\n\nBut that’s tedious.\n\nAlternative insight: Perhaps the condition “sum of elements in any non-empty subset is not divisible by 20” is equivalent to all elements being congruent to the same r mod 20 with gcd(r,20)=1 — and that’s the only possibility — so answer is 8 × C(50,19).\n\nGiven that, and that C(50,19) = 253724018596810 (I’ll assume this is correct; quick check: C(50,10) = 10,272,278,170; C(50,15) = 2,250,829,575,120; C(50,20) = 47,129,212,243,960; then C(50,19) = C(50,20) × 20 / 31 = 47129212243960 × 20 / 31.\n\nCompute: 47129212243960 × 20 = 942584244879200  \nDivide by 31: 942584244879200 / 31.\n\n31 × 30405943383200 = ? 31 × 3e13 = 9.3e14, close.\n\nActually, 31 × 30405943383200 = 31 × 3.04059433832e13 = let's do 942584244879200 ÷ 31.\n\n31 × 30,000,000,000,000 = 930,000,000,000,000  \nSubtract: 942,584,244,879,200 − 930,000,000,000,000 = 12,584,244,879,200  \n31 × 406,000,000,000 = 12,586,000,000,000 — too big  \n31 × 405,900,000,000 = 31×4.059e11 = ~1.25829e13  \nClose to 1.258424e13  \nDifference small.\n\nBut perhaps accept known value: online or standard computation gives C(50,19) = 253,724,018,596,810.\n\nThen ×8 = 2,029,792,148,774,480.\n\nSo answer is 2029792148774480.\n\nBut let me confirm with reliable source logic: Actually, I recall C(50,20) = 47129212243960, and C(50,19) = C(50,20) × 20 / 31 = 47129212243960 × 20 / 31.\n\nCalculate:\n\n47129212243960 × 20 = 942584244879200  \nNow divide by 31:\n\n942584244879200 ÷ 31.\n\nDo division:\n\n31 × 30405943383200 = ?  \n31 × 30,405,943,383,200 =  \n30,405,943,383,200 × 30 = 912,178,301,496,000  \nPlus 30,405,943,383,200 = 942,584,244,879,200 — exactly!\n\nSo 30,405,943,383,200 × 31 = 942,584,244,879,200  \nThus C(50,19) = 30,405,943,383,200\n\nWait, that contradicts earlier. Which is correct?\n\nC(50,20) = 47,129,212,243,960  \nThen C(50,19) = C(50,20) × 20 / 31 = 47,129,212,243,960 × 20 / 31\n\n47,129,212,243,960 × 20 = 942,584,244,879,200  \nYes.\n\n942,584,244,879,200 / 31 = ?\n\n31 × 30,405,943,383,200 = as above = 942,584,244,879,200  \nSo C(50,19) = 30,405,943,383,200\n\nThen ×8 = 243,247,547,065,600\n\nSo answer is 243247547065600.\n\nBut let me verify C(50,20): known value is indeed 47,129,212,243,960.\n\nYes, standard.\n\nSo C(50,19) = 47,129,212,243,960 × 20 / 31 = 942,584,244,879,200 / 31 = 30,405,943,383,200.\n\nThus 8 × that = 243,247,547,065,600.\n\nSo answer to Problem 2 is 243247547065600.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n- Problem 1: e = 19  \n- Problem 2: 243247547065600\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The minimal bit position j where two consecutive odd terms in an arithmetic progression with equal binary length differ is j=2 (since all odd numbers have bit 1 = 1).
