  "reasoning_content": "Let's solve each problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 1:**\n\nWe have 1000 animals in a circle: ducks (D), cows (C), and rabbits (R). Total:  \nD + C + R = 1000  \nGiven D = 600 ⇒ C + R = 400.\n\nConstraint: Every duck must satisfy **at least one** of:\n- Be adjacent to at least one cow (i.e., left or right neighbor is a cow), OR  \n- Be *between two rabbits*, i.e., both neighbors are rabbits → pattern R-D-R.\n\nGoal: Minimize number of cows C. So maximize use of the “between two rabbits” condition for ducks, since that doesn’t require cows.\n\nBut note: To have a duck between two rabbits (R-D-R), we need two rabbits per such duck — but rabbits can be shared among multiple such patterns.\n\nLet’s analyze possible duck placements:\n\nEach duck must be “covered” either by:\n- At least one adjacent cow (so duck is next to C), or  \n- Both neighbors are R (i.e., it's in an R-D-R triple).\n\nLet’s define:\n- Let x = number of ducks that are *between two rabbits*: i.e., positions where duck has R on both sides → R-D-R.\n\n- Let y = number of ducks that are *not* between two rabbits, so they must be adjacent to at least one cow.\n\nSo x + y = 600.\n\nNow, how many such R-D-R triples can exist? Each such triple uses 1 duck and 2 rabbits — but rabbits are shared: e.g., sequence R-D-R-D-R contains two overlapping R-D-R triples? No — R-D-R-D-R has positions:\n\n1: R  \n2: D  \n3: R  \n4: D  \n5: R  \n\nThen duck at position 2 has neighbors R,R → OK. Duck at position 4 has neighbors R,R → also OK. So rabbits at positions 1,3,5 cover *two* ducks. So 3 rabbits can support up to 2 such “between-rabbits” ducks.\n\nIn general, in a maximal block of alternating R-D-R-D-...-R, with k rabbits, you can fit k−1 ducks between them (since each internal duck is between two rabbits). For example:\n\n- R-D-R → 2 rabbits, 1 duck  \n- R-D-R-D-R → 3 rabbits, 2 ducks  \n- So pattern: a run of m rabbits in a row can’t help — because for R-D-R, rabbits must be *separated* by ducks. So to get many R-D-R, we want alternating R-D-R-D-...-R.\n\nBut animals are arranged in a *circle*, so the pattern must wrap around.\n\nSuppose we have a segment: R-D-R-D-...-R-D-R — starts and ends with R, length odd: number of R’s = number of D’s + 1.\n\nSo for x ducks placed as R-D-R type, minimal number of rabbits needed is x + 1 (in a linear segment), but in a circle, to close it, if we try to make a full cycle of R-D-R-D-...-R-D, then to wrap, last D must be adjacent to first R → so pattern would be R-D-R-D-...-R-D, ending with D, then back to first R. Then the last D has neighbors: previous R and first R → so yes, it's also R-D-R. So in a circular alternating pattern R-D-R-D-...-R-D, with equal numbers? Let's test small case.\n\nSuppose circle: R-D-R-D → 4 animals: positions 1=R, 2=D, 3=R, 4=D. Then neighbors:\n\n- D at 2: neighbors R (1) and R (3) → OK  \n- D at 4: neighbors R (3) and R (1) → OK  \nSo 2 ducks, 2 rabbits → works! So in circle, alternating R-D-R-D... with even length gives #R = #D.\n\nIndeed: In a circle, alternating R and D requires even number of animals, and #R = #D.\n\nSo for x ducks all in R-D-R configuration (i.e., each duck has R on both sides), we can achieve that with exactly x rabbits — if arranged alternately R-D-R-D-...-R-D (x of each), total 2x animals.\n\nBut wait: in R-D-R-D (x=2), rabbits are at positions 1 and 3 → two rabbits, yes. Each duck has two rabbit neighbors. So x ducks → x rabbits suffice in circular alternating pattern.\n\nHold on: In R-D-R-D (4 animals):  \n- D1 (pos2): neighbors pos1=R, pos3=R → OK  \n- D2 (pos4): neighbors pos3=R, pos1=R → OK  \nYes! So with x ducks in pure R-D alternating circle, we need exactly x rabbits.\n\nBut we also have cows possibly elsewhere. However, our goal is to minimize cows, so we want as many ducks as possible covered by R-D-R, i.e., placed in alternating R-D blocks.\n\nHowever, we cannot have *all* 600 ducks in such a pattern unless we have at least 600 rabbits — but total non-ducks are only 400 (since 1000 − 600 = 400). So max rabbits is 400, so max x ≤ 400.\n\nBut can we get x = 400 ducks covered by R-D-R using 400 rabbits? That would require 400 R and 400 D in alternating circle → 800 animals. But we have 600 ducks total, so we’d only be covering 400 of them that way; remaining 200 ducks must be covered by adjacency to cows.\n\nBut we only have 400 non-ducks total: R + C = 400. If we use R = 400, then C = 0. But then no cows — can remaining 200 ducks be covered? No — because if R = 400, D = 600, total animals = 1000, so all animals are R and D. Then we have 400 R and 600 D in a circle.\n\nCan we arrange 400 R and 600 D in a circle so that *every* D has either a C neighbor (but there is no C!) or is between two R’s?\n\nSo only option is: every D must be between two R’s.\n\nBut for a D to be between two R’s, it must have R on left and right. So each such D consumes two \"R adjacencies\". Each R has two neighbors; so each R can be neighbor to at most two ducks (its left and right neighbors). So each R can contribute to at most two D’s being \"covered\" via the between-two-R condition — but to cover a D via R-D-R, the D needs *two* R neighbors, i.e., consumes *two* R-adjacency slots.\n\nLet’s model this as a graph or counting argument.\n\nLet’s define:\n\nLet R = number of rabbits = r  \nLet C = number of cows = c  \nSo r + c = 400.\n\nEach duck must be either:\n- Adjacent to at least one cow, or  \n- Between two rabbits.\n\nLet’s count “rabbit-duck adjacencies”: each R has two neighbors; each neighbor could be D, C, or R. Let A_RD = number of adjacent (unordered) pairs {R,D} in the circle. Since it's a circle of 1000, there are 1000 adjacent pairs (each animal has left and right, but each edge counted once).\n\nEach such R-D adjacency contributes to covering a duck — but a duck needs either:\n- At least one R-D adjacency (if it's using rabbit adjacency — but alone that doesn’t satisfy condition; the condition for rabbit coverage is *two* R neighbors), or  \n- Two R-D adjacencies (i.e., both neighbors R).\n\nSo for a duck to be covered by rabbits only, it must have degree 2 in the R-D adjacency graph — i.e., be incident to two R-D edges.\n\nLet’s define:\n\nLet x = number of ducks with both neighbors rabbits → each such duck contributes 2 to A_RD.\n\nLet y = number of ducks with exactly one neighbor rabbit → contributes 1 to A_RD.\n\nLet z = number of ducks with no rabbit neighbors → contributes 0.\n\nThen x + y + z = 600.\n\nTotal A_RD = 2x + y.\n\nBut also, each rabbit has two neighbors; let’s say a rabbit’s neighbors are some combination. The maximum number of R-D adjacencies is bounded by number of rabbits times 2, i.e., A_RD ≤ 2r.\n\nSo 2x + y ≤ 2r.  (1)\n\nNow, which ducks are *not* covered by rabbit-only condition? Those with fewer than 2 rabbit neighbors, i.e., y + z ducks. These must be covered by having at least one cow neighbor.\n\nSo for each such duck, it must be adjacent to at least one cow.\n\nLet A_CD = number of C-D adjacencies.\n\nEach such adjacency can help cover a duck. A duck with at least one C neighbor is covered.\n\nSo to cover y + z ducks, we need A_CD ≥ y + z, because each C-D edge covers one duck (though one cow can cover up to two ducks — its two neighbors — so A_CD is the number of C-D adjacent pairs, and each such pair covers one duck; but one duck might be adjacent to two cows, but that’s fine — we just need at least one per duck).\n\nSo minimum A_CD needed is y + z.\n\nBut A_CD ≤ 2c, since each cow has two neighbors.\n\nSo y + z ≤ 2c.  (2)\n\nAlso, total non-ducks: r + c = 400.  (3)\n\nWe want to minimize c ⇒ maximize r.\n\nLet’s express everything in terms of r and c.\n\nFrom (3): c = 400 − r.\n\nFrom (2): y + z ≤ 2(400 − r) = 800 − 2r.\n\nBut y + z = 600 − x, since x + y + z = 600.\n\nSo 600 − x ≤ 800 − 2r ⇒ −x ≤ 200 − 2r ⇒ x ≥ 2r − 200.  (4)\n\nFrom (1): 2x + y ≤ 2r.\n\nBut y = (y + z) − z = (600 − x) − z − z? Wait no: y + z = 600 − x, so y = (600 − x) − z.\n\nBut z ≥ 0, so y ≤ 600 − x.\n\nThus 2x + y ≤ 2x + (600 − x) = x + 600.\n\nBut that’s weak.\n\nBetter: from (1): 2x + y ≤ 2r, and y ≥ 0, so 2x ≤ 2r ⇒ x ≤ r.\n\nAlso from (4): x ≥ 2r − 200.\n\nSo combine:\n\n2r − 200 ≤ x ≤ r\n\n⇒ 2r − 200 ≤ r ⇒ r ≤ 200.\n\nSo maximum possible r is 200.\n\nThen x ≥ 2(200) − 200 = 200, and x ≤ 200 ⇒ x = 200.\n\nSo r = 200 is achievable only if x = 200.\n\nThen y + z = 600 − 200 = 400.\n\nFrom (2): y + z ≤ 2c = 2(400 − r) = 2(200) = 400. So equality holds ⇒ y + z = 400 and c = 200.\n\nSo with r = 200, c = 200, x = 200, y + z = 400.\n\nNow check if (1) holds: 2x + y ≤ 2r = 400 ⇒ 400 + y ≤ 400 ⇒ y ≤ 0 ⇒ y = 0.\n\nThen z = 400.\n\nSo y = 0, z = 400, x = 200.\n\nThat means:\n- 200 ducks have both neighbors rabbits,\n- 400 ducks have no rabbit neighbors (z = 400),\n- and y = 0 means no duck has exactly one rabbit neighbor.\n\nNow, is this feasible?\n\nWe have r = 200 rabbits.\n\nEach of the x = 200 ducks with two rabbit neighbors must be placed as R-D-R.\n\nEach such R-D-R uses two R-D adjacencies, and involves two rabbits and one duck.\n\nBut rabbits are shared? For example, R1-D1-R2-D2-R3: here D1 uses R1 and R2, D2 uses R2 and R3. So R2 is shared.\n\nSo to get x ducks each with two R neighbors, we need at least x+1 rabbits in a line, but in a circle, perhaps x rabbits suffice? Earlier we saw R-D-R-D circle with equal numbers works.\n\nBut here x = 200, r = 200. Can we arrange 200 R and 200 D in alternating circle? That would give 200 R-D-R triples? Wait, in R-D-R-D-...-R-D (200 each), total 400 animals, each D has two R neighbors → yes, all 200 D’s are covered. So that uses 200 R and 200 D.\n\nBut we have 600 D’s total, so remaining 400 D’s must be placed somewhere else.\n\nTotal animals: 1000 = 600 D + r + c = 600 + 200 + 200 = 1000. Good.\n\nSo far we used 200 R and 200 D in an alternating block? But it's a circle — we can’t have disjoint blocks easily; it's one circle.\n\nWe need to place all 1000 animals in one circle.\n\nWe have 200 R, 200 C, 600 D.\n\nWe want 200 D’s to be each between two R’s → so those 200 D’s must each have R on both sides.\n\nThat requires, for each such D, two R neighbors. Since there are only 200 R’s, and each R has only two neighbors, the total number of \"R-neighbor-slots\" is 2 × 200 = 400.\n\nEach R-D-R duck uses two of those slots (one R provides one slot, the other R provides another). So 200 such ducks consume 200 × 2 = 400 R-neighbor-slots — exactly all available.\n\nTherefore, *all* R-neighbor-slots are used to cover those 200 ducks — meaning no R is adjacent to anything other than those 200 ducks. So each R has both neighbors being those special ducks.\n\nThus, the 200 R’s and 200 D’s form a perfect alternating cycle: R-D-R-D-...-R-D, length 400.\n\nThat uses 200 R and 200 D.\n\nRemaining animals: 600 − 200 = 400 ducks, and 200 cows.\n\nSo 400 D + 200 C = 600 animals left to place.\n\nThey must be arranged in the circle along with the 400-animal R-D block.\n\nBut the circle has to be connected. So we need to interleave or attach.\n\nThe remaining 400 D must each be adjacent to at least one cow (since they have no R neighbors — all R-adjacency slots are used up).\n\nSo these 400 D must be placed such that each is next to a C.\n\nEach cow has two neighbors; to cover 400 D’s, with each cow able to cover up to two D’s (if both neighbors are D), we need at least 400 / 2 = 200 cows — which we have.\n\nSo if we arrange blocks like C-D-C-D-... or D-C-D-C..., but we have 200 C and 400 D.\n\nMaximum D’s a cow can cover is 2 (its two neighbors), so 200 cows can cover up to 400 D’s — exactly.\n\nSo we need each cow to have both neighbors being D, and no two cows adjacent (otherwise a cow’s neighbor might be C, wasting a slot).\n\nSo ideal pattern: D-C-D-C-D-... i.e., alternating D and C. With 200 C and 400 D, that would require 200 C each separating two D’s, but 200 C can separate at most 200×2 = 400 D’s if placed as isolated C’s each between two D’s.\n\nPattern: D-C-D-C-D-...-D-C-D → starts and ends with D, number of C = number of gaps between D’s.\n\nIf we have a sequence of 400 D’s, inserting a C between some of them.\n\nBut to give each C two D neighbors, C must be between two D’s: i.e., D-C-D.\n\nEach such unit uses 1 C and 2 D’s, but D’s are shared: D-C-D-C-D uses 3 D and 2 C.\n\nGeneral: a segment D-C-D-C-...-D with k C’s has k+1 D’s.\n\nSo to get 200 C’s and 400 D’s in such a chain: number of D’s = number of C’s + 1 = 201 — too few.\n\nBut we need 400 D’s covered by 200 C’s, each covering two D’s — that suggests each C is adjacent to two D’s, i.e., local pattern D-C-D, and these can overlap: e.g., D-C-D-C-D has C1 neighbors D1,D2; C2 neighbors D2,D3 — so D2 is shared. So with 200 C’s, we can cover 200 + 1 = 201 D’s if linear, but we need 400.\n\nWait, no: in D-C-D-C-D, number of D’s is 3, C’s is 2, and each D except ends has two C neighbors? Let's list:\n\nPositions: 1:D, 2:C, 3:D, 4:C, 5:D\n\nD1 neighbors: C2 only (and position 5? No, linear; but circle is circular, so need to consider.\n\nIn circle, to maximize coverage, best is to place cows surrounded by ducks: i.e., each cow has two duck neighbors. Then each cow covers two ducks (since each such duck has at least one cow neighbor).\n\nSo with 200 cows, each with two D neighbors, that's 400 D-neighbor slots, each assigned to a distinct duck (since each duck needs only one such slot), so yes, 400 ducks can each be adjacent to exactly one cow.\n\nBut can a duck be adjacent to two cows? Yes, but not necessary.\n\nSo arrangement: intersperse the 200 C’s among the 400 D’s such that each C is between two D’s, and no two C’s are adjacent.\n\nFor example, pattern: D-D-C-D-D-C-... but then each C has two D neighbors, and each D may have zero or one C neighbor.\n\nTo ensure each of the 400 D’s has at least one C neighbor, we need that the C’s are placed so that no D is isolated from C’s.\n\nMaximum gap between C’s: if we place C’s every k positions, then ducks between them must be within distance 1 of a C.\n\nSince each C covers its two adjacent positions, a C at position i covers positions i−1 and i+1.\n\nSo the set of positions covered by C’s is the union of {i−1, i+1} for each C at i.\n\nTo cover 400 specific duck positions, we need their positions to be subset of ∪{i−1,i+1}.\n\nBut in our case, the 400 ducks are to be placed, and we can choose positions.\n\nSo yes, possible: place 200 C’s, and put a D before and after each C: i.e., for each C, have D-C-D. But that would use 200×3 = 600 positions for 200 C and 400 D — exactly! Because each D-C-D unit has 1 C and 2 D’s, but D’s are not shared between units. So 200 units × (D-C-D) = 200 C, 400 D, length 600.\n\nThen we have the other block: 200 R and 200 D in alternating R-D-R-D... length 400.\n\nBut total would be 600 + 400 = 1000 — perfect.\n\nNow, can we concatenate them in a circle? The R-D block is length 400, ends with say D (since R-D-R-D... with even length ends with D). The D-C-D block starts with D — so joining D to D is fine, but then that junction D has neighbors: previous D (from R-D block) and next C? Wait, need to arrange carefully.\n\nActually, the circle must be seamless. But existence is plausible; the counting constraints are satisfied, and equality cases are achievable.\n\nThus minimal c = 200, achieved when r = 200.\n\nThe problem asks for k = r − 198, where r is number of rabbits in arrangement achieving minimum cows.\n\nSo r = 200 ⇒ k = 200 − 198 = 2.\n\nBut wait — is r = 200 indeed achievable? We assumed yes, but let's verify the inequality again.\n\nWe had from x ≥ 2r − 200 and x ≤ r, so r ≤ 200.\n\nAnd for r = 200, x = 200.\n\nThen A_RD = 2x + y = 400 + y ≤ 2r = 400 ⇒ y = 0.\n\nThen z = 400, y + z = 400 = 2c = 400 ⇒ c = 200.\n\nSo yes.\n\nCould r be less than 200? Yes, but we want minimal c, which corresponds to maximal r, so r = 200 is best.\n\nThus k = 200 − 198 = 2.\n\nAnswer to Problem 1 is 2.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\nFind the largest integer n such that there exists a set of n points in the plane with the property: for any choice of three points, some two are at unit distance apart.\n\nIn other words: no 3-point subset is \"unit-distance-free\"; i.e., the graph with vertices as points and edges between unit-distance pairs must have the property that every 3-vertex subset contains at least one edge. Equivalently, the graph has **independence number α(G) ≤ 2**, i.e., no independent set of size 3.\n\nSo we need the largest n such that there exists a unit-distance graph in the plane with independence number at most 2.\n\nEquivalently: what’s the maximum number of points in the plane with no three mutually pairwise non-unit-distance — i.e., the complement graph has no triangle? No: condition is that in every 3-subset, at least one pair is at unit distance ⇒ the complement graph has no triangle (since a triangle in complement means three points, no two at unit distance). So complement graph is triangle-free.\n\nSo we want a set S of n points in plane, such that the unit-distance graph G has complement \\overline{G} triangle-free.\n\nBy Turán's theorem, a triangle-free graph on n vertices has at most ⌊n²/4⌋ edges.\n\nSo \\overline{G} has at most ⌊n²/4⌋ edges.\n\nBut \\overline{G}’s edges are pairs *not* at unit distance.\n\nTotal possible pairs: \\binom{n}{2}.\n\nSo number of unit-distance pairs in G is at least \\binom{n}{2} − ⌊n²/4⌋.\n\nBut that’s a lower bound; not directly helpful.\n\nWe need existence.\n\nKnown related problem: the \"no-three-in-line\" or unit-distance problems.\n\nThis is similar to finding the maximum size of a set with no equilateral triangle? No.\n\nActually, this is asking for the largest n where the plane admits an n-point set whose unit-distance graph has independence number ≤ 2.\n\nWhat’s the largest known such set?\n\nConsider small cases.\n\nn = 3: easy — place an equilateral triangle of side 1. Then all pairs are unit distance — certainly satisfies.\n\nn = 4: can we place 4 points so that every 3 contain a unit pair? Yes, e.g., vertices of unit rhombus.\n\nBut we need for *all* triples — there are \\binom{4}{3}=4 triples; each must have a unit pair.\n\nEquivalently, the only forbidden configuration is a triple with all three distances ≠ 1.\n\nSo to maximize n, we want to avoid having any 3-point subset with all pairwise distances ≠ 1.\n\nWhat’s the minimal number of unit distances needed? Not clear.\n\nKnown result: The Moser spindle has 7 points, unit-distance graph with chromatic number 4, independence number? Let's see.\n\nBut perhaps think of constructing large sets.\n\nSuppose we take points on a line. Unit distances on a line are limited: if points are on real line, unit distance pairs are those at distance 1. To avoid three points with no unit pair, we need that in any three, two are at distance 1.\n\nOn a line, maximum n? Suppose points at integers: then unit distance only between consecutive integers. So the unit-distance graph is a path. Independence number of a path on n vertices is ⌈n/2⌉. We need ⌈n/2⌉ ≤ 2 ⇒ n ≤ 4. So on line, max n=4.\n\nBut in plane, better.\n\nConsider a set of points all lying on a circle of radius r. Unit chords correspond to central angle θ where chord length = 2r sin(θ/2) = 1 ⇒ sin(θ/2) = 1/(2r). So for appropriate r, many chords can be unit.\n\nBut perhaps known extremal result.\n\nThis problem is known: it's asking for the maximum number of points in the plane with no 3-point subset forming a \"unit-distance-free\" set, i.e., the Ramsey-type number R(3; G_unit), but not exactly.\n\nActually, it's the largest n such that the unit-distance graph can have independence number 2.\n\nWhat's the maximum n where α(G) ≤ 2 for some unit-distance graph G in plane?\n\nEquivalently, the smallest n where *every* n-point set in plane has an independent set of size 3 in the unit-distance graph — but we want existence of one set with no independent set of size 3.\n\nSo it's the maximum n such that there exists a unit-distance graph in plane with α ≤ 2.\n\nKnown that the Moser spindle has 7 vertices, and its independence number is 3? Let me recall: Moser spindle is two rhombi sharing a vertex, 7 points, unit distances, and it's 4-chromatic. Independence number: total vertices 7, chromatic number 4, so α ≥ 7/4 = 1.75, so α ≥ 2. Actually, I think α = 3 for Moser spindle.\n\nPerhaps consider regular polygons.\n\nEquilateral triangle: n=3, α=1.\n\nSquare with side 1: points A,B,C,D. Distances: AB=BC=CD=DA=1, AC=BD=√2 ≠1, AD=1? If labeled cyclically, AB=BC=CD=DA=1, then diagonals √2. So unit pairs are the 4 sides. Then independent set: can we find 3 points with no unit pair? A and C are not adjacent (distance √2), A and D are adjacent (distance 1), so {A,C} is independent, but add B? A-B=1, B-C=1, so no. {A,C,D}: A-D=1, so no. Max independent set size is 2 (e.g., A and C). So square has α=2, n=4.\n\nAdd center of square? Distance from center to corner is √2/2 ≈ 0.707 ≠1, so no new unit distances. So unit graph unchanged, independent set still size 2? But now n=5, and {center, A, C} — center-A ≠1, center-C ≠1, A-C=√2≠1, so {center,A,C} is independent set of size 3! So not allowed.\n\nSo adding center breaks it.\n\nWhat about vertices of regular pentagon with side length 1? Then adjacent distances are 1, others are larger. Independent set: non-adjacent vertices. In C5, independence number is 2 (since α(C5)=2). So n=5 possible.\n\nRegular pentagon side 1: distances between vertices: only adjacent are 1, others are >1 (golden ratio related, ~1.618). So unit-distance graph is C5, α=2. So n=5 works.\n\nRegular hexagon side 1: unit distances: adjacent (6 edges), and opposite? Distance across is 2, not 1. So graph is C6, α(C6)=3 (e.g., every other vertex: 3 vertices, no two adjacent). So {v1,v3,v5} — distances v1-v3 is 2*sin(120°)=2*(√3/2)=√3≈1.732≠1, so no unit distance, so independent set of size 3. So hexagon fails.\n\nSo C5 works, n=5.\n\nCan we get n=6?\n\nTry the complete graph K3 plus three more points each connected to all? But unit distance can't realize K6 in plane.\n\nPerhaps two equilateral triangles sharing a base: like a rhombus made of two equilateral triangles — i.e., diamond with angles 60 and 120. Points: A,B,C,D where ABC and ABD are equilateral. So A,B,C equilateral side 1, A,B,D equilateral side 1 on other side. So points: A,B,C,D. Distances: AB=AC=BC=AD=BD=1, CD = ? In this kite, C and D are symmetric over AB, distance CD = √3 ≈1.732 ≠1. So unit distances: all pairs except C-D. So graph is K4 minus one edge. Independence number: can we find 3 points with no unit pair? Only missing edge is C-D, so any triple containing C and D and one more: C-D not edge, but C-A is edge, so not independent. The only non-edge is C-D, so maximum independent set size is 2 (e.g., {C,D}). So n=4, α=2.\n\nAdd a fifth point E such that it is at unit distance from some, but not creating independent triple.\n\nPerhaps the Petersen graph? Not realizable as unit-distance.\n\nKnown result: The maximum is 6.\n\nWait, consider the vertices of a regular triangle with side 1, and its three midpoints. But distances: midpoint to vertices is 0.5, not 1.\n\nAnother idea: Take an equilateral triangle of side 1: A,B,C. Add points at unit distance from two vertices. For example, the two possible positions for a point at unit distance from A and B are the third vertices of equilateral triangles: C and C' (reflection). So C' is the other intersection of circles radius 1 around A and B. So points A,B,C,C'. Now distances: A-B=1, A-C=1, B-C=1, A-C'=1, B-C'=1, C-C' = ? In equilateral triangle, C and C' are symmetric over AB, distance C-C' = √3. So unit distances include all pairs except C-C'. So same as before, 4 points.\n\nAdd a fifth point D at unit distance from C and C'? Then D would be at intersection of circles radius 1 around C and C', distance C-C'=√3 < 2, so two intersections. But then check independence.\n\nPerhaps search known answer.\n\nI recall a similar problem: \"What is the largest set in the plane with no three points pairwise at distances all different from 1?\" But here it's \"at least one pair equals 1\".\n\nThis is equivalent to saying the family of unit-distance avoiding sets has VC-dimension or something, but perhaps not.\n\nAnother angle: suppose we take all points of a triangular lattice with minimum distance 1. Then many unit distances. But independence number might be large.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 6.\n\nTry to construct 6 points.\n\nTake a regular pentagon with side 1: 5 points, α=2.\n\nAdd a sixth point at unit distance from two non-adjacent vertices? Say in pentagon A,B,C,D,E, add F such that F-A=1 and F-C=1. Then in triple {F,B,D}, need some unit pair. If B-D ≠1, F-B? Not necessarily 1. So may create independent triple.\n\nPerhaps the optimal is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3} realized as unit-distance? But K_{3,3} is not a unit-distance graph in plane (it's not planar, but unit-distance graphs can be non-planar; however, K_{3,3} is not a unit-distance graph — known result).\n\nActually, a known construction: the 6-point set consisting of vertices of a regular triangle and the centers of its sides? No.\n\nWait, consider points: (0,0), (1,0), (0.5, √3/2) — equilateral triangle side 1.\n\nAdd (0,1), (1,1), (0.5, 1+√3/2)? Too messy.\n\nPerhaps look for known answer.\n\nI recall that the maximum is 6, achieved by the vertices of a regular pentagon plus its center, but only if center-to-vertex is 1. For regular pentagon, radius R = 1/(2 sin(π/5)) = 1/(2 sin 36°) ≈ 1/(2*0.5878) ≈ 0.8507, not 1. So not unit.\n\nIf we take a regular hexagon with side length 1, radius is 1, so distance from center to vertex is 1. So vertices of regular hexagon + center = 7 points. Unit distances: each vertex to center =1, and adjacent vertices =1. So unit graph has edges from center to all 6, and the 6-cycle edges.\n\nSo total edges: 6 (spokes) + 6 (rim) = 12.\n\nNow, independence number: can we find 3 points with no unit pair? Try three alternate vertices on rim: v1,v3,v5. Distances: v1-v3 = 2 (diameter), not 1; v1-v5 = 2; v3-v5 = 2. And none connected to center since we didn't include center. So {v1,v3,v5} — no two at unit distance? v1-v2=1, but v2 not in set. So yes, {v1,v3,v5} is independent set of size 3. So fails.\n\nBut if we take only the center and three vertices that are mutually at distance >1 and not adjacent. In hexagon, v1,v3,v5 are all distance 2 apart, and none adjacent, so yes.\n\nSo not good.\n\nWhat if we take the vertices of a square with side 1, and its two diagonally opposite vertices? Already have 4.\n\nAdd points at unit distance from two corners.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 6, and it's a known result.\n\nUpon second thought, this problem is identical to finding the largest n such that the unit-distance graph can be the complement of a triangle-free graph, and by geometric constraints, the maximum is 6.\n\nI found online (recalling) that the answer is 6.\n\nFor example, take the following 6 points: the vertices of a regular triangle of side 1, and the three points obtained by rotating each vertex around the centroid by 120 degrees — but complicated.\n\nA standard example is the \"triangular prism\" graph, but in plane.\n\nPerhaps accept that n=6 is possible, n=7 is impossible.\n\nAssume answer is 6.\n\nBut let's verify if n=6 is possible.\n\nTake points: A=(0,0), B=(1,0), C=(0.5, √3/2) — equilateral triangle side 1.\n\nAdd D=(0,1), E=(1,1), F=(0.5, 1+√3/2). Then distances: A-D=1, B-E=1, C-F=1, and D-E=1, etc. But many distances not 1.\n\nToo many unknowns.\n\nPerhaps the minimal counterexample is known: Erdős–Faber–Lovász or others.\n\nAnother idea: In the plane, the maximum number of points with mutual distances in {1,d} for some d, but not helpful.\n\nI recall that the answer to this exact problem is **6**.\n\nFor instance, the set consisting of the vertices of a regular pentagon and one additional point placed to \"cover\" all triples.\n\nSince for n=6, \\binom{6}{3}=20 triples, and we need each to contain a unit pair, it's feasible.\n\nAnd it's known that 7 is impossible because of the following: By the pigeonhole principle or combinatorial geometry, any 7 points in the plane contain a triple with all distances ≠1. But I'm not sure.\n\nActually, consider that the unit-distance graph on n points has at most O(n^{4/3}) edges (by Szemerédi–Trotter), but for independence number, not direct.\n\nPerhaps upper bound: if α ≤ 2, then the graph is the union of two cliques? No, independence number ≤2 means the complement is triangle-free, not that graph is union of cliques.\n\nBy Turán, complement has ≤ floor(n²/4) edges, so unit-distance graph has ≥ \\binom{n}{2} - n²/4 = n(n-1)/2 - n²/4 = (2n(n-1) - n²)/4 = (2n² - 2n - n²)/4 = (n² - 2n)/4 = n(n-2)/4 edges.\n\nSo unit-distance graph must have at least n(n-2)/4 unit distances.\n\nFor n=7, need at least 7*5/4 = 35/4 = 8.75, so at least 9 unit distances.\n\nIs it possible to have 7 points in plane with at least 9 unit distances and no independent set of size 3? Possibly, but geometrically constrained.\n\nHowever, I think the accepted answer is **6**.\n\nSo answer to Problem 2 is 6.\n\nBut let me double-check with a concrete construction for n=6.\n\nConstruction: Take an equilateral triangle ABC side 1. Add points D,E,F such that D is at unit distance from A and B, E from B and C, F from C and A. So D is the other intersection of circles radius 1 around A and B, similarly for others.\n\nSo we have triangle ABC, and three outer points D,E,F.\n\nDistances: A-B=1, A-C=1, B-C=1, A-D=1, B-D=1, B-E=1, C-E=1, C-F=1, A-F=1.\n\nAlso, D-E? Distance between D and E: depends. In standard configuration, D, E, F form another triangle.\n\nThis is the Moser spindle, which has 7 points. Moser spindle has 7 points and is used to show chromatic number at least 4. Its independence number is 3? Let me check.\n\nMoser spindle: two rhombi ABCD and AEFG sharing vertex A, with all sides length 1, and diagonal BD = EG = 1. Actually, it's 7 points: A,B,C,D,E,F,G? Standard Moser spindle has 7 vertices.\n\nUpon recall, Moser spindle has independence number 3.\n\nSo perhaps n=6 is maximum.\n\nI think the answer is 6.\n\nSo final answers:\n\nProblem 1: k = 2  \nProblem 2: n = 6\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: With 600 ducks and 400 non-ducks (rabbits r and cows c), the constraint that every duck must be adjacent to a cow or between two rabbits leads to inequalities showing r <= 200.
