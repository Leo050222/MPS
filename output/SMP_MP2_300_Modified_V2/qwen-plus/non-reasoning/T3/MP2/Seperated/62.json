  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\nWe are told:\n\n- $ f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} $\n- For all integers $ x, y $:  \n  $$ f(x) + f(y) = f(x+1) + f(y-1) $$\n- $ f(2016) = 6102 $, $ f(6102) = 2016 $\n- Define $ k = f(z+1) - f(z) $, the constant difference (we’ll verify it’s constant).\n- Then compute $ h = k + 5 $\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the functional equation\n\nGiven:\n$$\nf(x) + f(y) = f(x+1) + f(y-1) \\quad \\text{for all } x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\n\nRearrange:\n$$\nf(x+1) - f(x) = f(y) - f(y-1)\n$$\n\nLeft side depends only on $ x $, right side only on $ y $. So both sides must be equal to a constant — call it $ k $. That is:\n\n$$\nf(x+1) - f(x) = k \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\n\nSo $ f $ is an arithmetic sequence over integers:  \n$$\nf(n) = f(0) + kn\n$$\n\nLet’s verify: If $ f(n) = a + kn $, then  \n$ f(x) + f(y) = a + kx + a + ky = 2a + k(x+y) $  \n$ f(x+1) + f(y-1) = a + k(x+1) + a + k(y-1) = 2a + kx + k + ky - k = 2a + k(x+y) $  \n✅ So it satisfies the equation.\n\nThus $ f $ is linear with integer slope $ k $, and integer intercept $ a = f(0) $.\n\nSo general form:  \n$$\nf(n) = kn + c \\quad \\text{for some integers } k, c\n$$\n\nGiven:\n- $ f(2016) = 6102 \\Rightarrow k \\cdot 2016 + c = 6102 $  \n- $ f(6102) = 2016 \\Rightarrow k \\cdot 6102 + c = 2016 $\n\nSubtract first from second:\n\n$$\nk(6102 - 2016) = 2016 - 6102 \\\\\nk(4086) = -4086 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow k = -1\n$$\n\nSo the constant difference $ k = f(z+1) - f(z) = -1 $\n\nThen $ h = k + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4 $\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **4**\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\nWe need to count the number of ways to tile a $ 4 \\times 4n $ grid with a specific tetromino.\n\nFirst, understand the tetromino shape from Asymptote code:\n\n```asy\ndraw((1,0)--(3,0)--(3,1)--(0,1)--(0,0)--(1,0)--(1,2)--(2,2)--(2,0));\n```\n\nLet’s parse coordinates:\n\n- Points drawn in order:\n  - (1,0) → (3,0): horizontal segment length 2 along x-axis at y=0\n  - (3,0) → (3,1): up 1\n  - (3,1) → (0,1): left 3 at y=1\n  - (0,1) → (0,0): down 1\n  - (0,0) → (1,0): right 1\n  - (1,0) → (1,2): up 2\n  - (1,2) → (2,2): right 1\n  - (2,2) → (2,0): down 2\n\nThis draws a shape — but perhaps easier: count unit squares.\n\nIt's a tetromino → 4 unit squares.\n\nLet’s reconstruct the shape by listing occupied unit squares.\n\nFrom the drawing path, it looks like a “T”-like or “skew” shape? But better to search known tetrominoes.\n\nAlternatively, notice the Asymptote draws a polygonal outline — maybe it's the **T-tetromino**, **L**, **S**, etc.\n\nBut let’s try to deduce the shape.\n\nThe path goes:\n\n- From (1,0) to (3,0): covers bottom edge from x=1 to x=3 at y=0 → so squares possibly at (1,0), (2,0)? Wait, unit squares are usually [i,i+1] × [j,j+1].\n\nBut perhaps simpler: standard tetromino tiling problems often use the **T-tetromino**, **L**, **I**, **O**, **S**, etc.\n\nHowever, the Asymptote code draws a shape that includes:\n\n- A 3×1 horizontal bar at y=1 from x=0 to x=3 → i.e., cells (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)? But wait, from (3,1) to (0,1) is a line — top edge.\n\n- Then (0,1) to (0,0) to (1,0) → left-bottom corner.\n\n- Then (1,0) up to (1,2), then right to (2,2), then down to (2,0).\n\nLet me list all unit squares inside this boundary.\n\nAlternative idea: This is a known problem — the tetromino shown is the **\"T\" tetromino**? Or maybe the **\"skew\" (S or Z)**? But S/Z are 2×2 with offset.\n\nWait — actually, common contest problem: tiling $ 4 \\times n $ board with **T-tetrominoes** — but T-tetromino covers 4 squares, but cannot tile $ 4 \\times n $ for arbitrary n because of coloring arguments.\n\nBut here it's $ 4 \\times 4n $, and tetromino is fixed.\n\nLet me try to identify the shape precisely.\n\nAsymptote code draws outline:\n\nStart at (1,0)\n\n- (1,0) → (3,0): line right → x from 1 to 3 at y=0  \n- (3,0) → (3,1): up to y=1  \n- (3,1) → (0,1): left to x=0 at y=1  \n- (0,1) → (0,0): down to y=0  \n- (0,0) → (1,0): right to start — closes lower part? But then continues:\n\n- (1,0) → (1,2): up to y=2  \n- (1,2) → (2,2): right  \n- (2,2) → (2,0): down to y=0  \n\nSo overall shape has bounding box from x=0 to 3, y=0 to 2.\n\nLet’s mark unit squares with bottom-left corners (i,j) where square occupies [i,i+1]×[j,j+1].\n\nPlot points:\n\nThe polygon vertices (in order):\n\n1. (1,0)  \n2. (3,0)  \n3. (3,1)  \n4. (0,1)  \n5. (0,0)  \n6. (1,0) ← back, but then continues  \n7. (1,2)  \n8. (2,2)  \n9. (2,0)\n\nWait — but (2,0) is on x-axis, between (1,0) and (3,0). So the figure is self-intersecting? Unlikely.\n\nBetter: maybe it's a union of unit squares:\n\nFrom description, likely the tetromino consists of squares at:\n\n- (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) — that’s an L-shape of height 3 and width 2? No, that’s 4 squares: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) → that’s a “straight” L (3 vertical + 1 horizontal), i.e., a **skew?** Actually that’s a **'L' tetromino** rotated.\n\nBut let’s count squares in standard tetrominoes:\n\n- I: 1×4  \n- O: 2×2  \n- T: center with 3 in row and one above/below  \n- L: 3 in line + one perpendicular at end  \n- S: zigzag 2×2 offset\n\nBut the Asymptote code is known in some contests — this particular drawing is the **T-tetromino**? Let's search mental image.\n\nAlternatively, notice the problem says: *In how many ways can a $ 4 \\times 4n $ grid be tiled* with this tetromino?\n\nKey observations:\n\n- Each tetromino covers 4 squares ⇒ total squares = $ 4 \\times 4n = 16n $, divisible by 4 ⇒ possible.\n\n- The grid is 4 rows high, arbitrary width multiple of 4.\n\n- Many tiling problems with fixed tetromino on $ 4 \\times m $ have either 0 tilings or 1 or exponential — but answer likely simple: maybe **0**, **1**, or **$ 2^n $**, etc.\n\nBut we need to determine based on shape.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct unit squares covered.\n\nFrom path:\n\n- Bottom edge from x=0 to x=3 at y=0 is drawn twice? Not quite.\n\nList all edges:\n\n1. (1,0)-(3,0): bottom edge of squares (1,0) and (2,0)  \n2. (3,0)-(3,1): right edge of square (2,0) and (2,1)?  \n3. (3,1)-(0,1): top edge at y=1 from x=0 to x=3 → top of squares (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)? No — y=1 is top of row j=0.\n\nSo squares with y-interval [0,1] have top at y=1.\n\nSo edge (3,1)-(0,1) is top edge of row y=0 → implies squares (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0) are present? But then (0,0)-(1,0)-(3,0) already suggests that.\n\nBut then (0,1)-(0,0) is left edge of (0,0); (0,0)-(1,0) bottom edge.\n\nThen (1,0)-(1,2): vertical line at x=1 from y=0 to y=2 → suggests squares (1,0), (1,1) — and maybe (1,2)? But y=2 is top of row j=1? Wait, square (i,j) occupies x∈[i,i+1], y∈[j,j+1]. So y from 0 to 1 is row 0; 1 to 2 is row 1.\n\nSo vertical line x=1 from y=0 to y=2 is left edge of squares (1,0) and (1,1).\n\nThen (1,2)-(2,2): top edge of row j=1, from x=1 to 2 → top of square (1,1)\n\nThen (2,2)-(2,0): vertical line x=2 from y=0 to y=2 → right edge of squares (1,0) and (1,1)\n\nSo far, squares involved:\n\n- (0,0): bounded by x=0–1, y=0–1  \n- (1,0): x=1–2, y=0–1  \n- (2,0): x=2–3, y=0–1  \n- (1,1): x=1–2, y=1–2  \n\nThat’s 4 squares: positions (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (1,1) — that’s the **T-tetromino**: three in a row horizontally at bottom (y=0), and one centered above middle (at (1,1)).\n\nYes! That matches classic T-tetromino.\n\nSo shape is:\n\n```\n  □\n□ □ □\n```\n\ni.e., row y=1: one square at x=1  \nrow y=0: squares at x=0,1,2\n\nSo occupies cells: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (1,1)\n\nNow, can we tile a $ 4 \\times 4n $ board with T-tetrominoes?\n\nImportant fact: **T-tetromino has odd parity under checkerboard coloring**.\n\nStandard checkerboard coloring of grid: cell (i,j) is black if i+j even.\n\nEach T-tetromino covers 3 squares of one color and 1 of the other — because in T-shape: suppose base at y=0: (0,0)=black, (1,0)=white, (2,0)=black, stem (1,1)=white → so 2 black, 2 white? Wait:\n\n- (0,0): 0+0 = even → black  \n- (1,0): 1+0 = odd → white  \n- (2,0): 2+0 = even → black  \n- (1,1): 1+1 = even → black  \n\nSo 3 black, 1 white.\n\nYes! So imbalance: covers 3 of one color, 1 of other.\n\nTotal cells in $ 4 \\times 4n = 16n $: half black, half white → 8n each.\n\nEach T-tetromino covers 3 of one color and 1 of other ⇒ net excess of 2 per tile.\n\nSo if we use $ t $ tiles, total black squares covered = $ 3a + 1b $, where a tiles placed \"black-heavy\", b placed \"white-heavy\", but since tile can be rotated, it can be placed in 4 orientations, each covering either 3 black + 1 white or 3 white + 1 black depending on position.\n\nBut crucially, **each placement covers an odd number of black squares** (3 or 1), so total black squares covered = sum of t odd numbers = t mod 2.\n\nWe need total black squares = 8n, which is even ⇒ t must be even.\n\nBut that doesn’t forbid tiling.\n\nHowever, known result: **A rectangle can be tiled with T-tetrominoes iff both sides are multiples of 4.**\n\nIndeed, $ 4 \\times 4n $ satisfies that.\n\nMoreover, it's known that the number of tilings of $ 4 \\times 4n $ with T-tetrominoes is **1**? Or more?\n\nWait — actually, no. Small cases:\n\n- $ 4 \\times 4 $: Can it be tiled with T-tetrominoes? 16 squares → 4 tiles.\n\nBut due to geometry, it's impossible? Let's test.\n\nActually, well-known result: **T-tetromino cannot tile any rectangle unless both dimensions are multiples of 4**, and moreover, the number of tilings of $ 4 \\times 4n $ is $ 0 $ for all n? Or not?\n\nWait — I recall that T-tetromino has a coloring invariant modulo 4.\n\nAnother coloring: use mod 4 coloring in rows or columns.\n\nBut perhaps simpler: look for existing knowledge.\n\nActually, there's a famous result: the T-tetromino **cannot tile any rectangle** — is that true?\n\nNo — counterexample: $ 8 \\times 8 $ can be tiled? I think yes, but not $ 4 \\times 4 $.\n\nLet’s try $ 4 \\times 4 $.\n\nSuppose we try to place a T-tetromino in corner: say covering (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (1,1). That occupies rows 0 and 1, columns 0–2.\n\nThen remaining area is messy.\n\nBut known fact: **The T-tetromino does not tile any rectangle.** Is that correct?\n\nUpon recall: Yes! It's a classic result that no rectangle can be tiled by T-tetrominoes. Why? Because of a coloring with 4 colors.\n\nUse coloring $ c(i,j) = (i \\bmod 2, j \\bmod 2) $, i.e., 2×2 periodic.\n\nEach T-tetromino, in any orientation, covers all four color classes? Let's check.\n\nOur T: cells (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (1,1)\n\nMod 2:\n\n- (0,0) → (0,0)  \n- (1,0) → (1,0)  \n- (2,0) → (0,0) again  \n- (1,1) → (1,1)\n\nSo colors covered: (0,0) twice, (1,0), (1,1) — missing (0,1). So not balanced.\n\nThus total coverage over rectangle would require equal counts of each color, but T misses one color per placement ⇒ impossible.\n\nIn $ 4 \\times 4n $, number of cells of each 2×2 color is equal: since 4 is multiple of 2, $ 4 \\times 4n = 16n $ cells, divided equally into 4 color classes → 4n each.\n\nBut each T-tetromino covers:\n\n- In orientation above: (0,0), (1,0), (0,0), (1,1) → colors: (0,0)×2, (1,0)×1, (1,1)×1 → counts: (0,0):2, others:1 ⇒ sum over all tiles must match 4n each ⇒ impossible because (0,0) count would be even, but others odd per tile — inconsistency.\n\nBut different orientations may cover different distributions.\n\nTry rotating T 90°: then cells might be (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1) — mod 2: (0,0), (0,1), (0,0), (1,1) → (0,0)×2, (0,1), (1,1)\n\nStill missing (1,0).\n\nAll rotations of T-tetromino always miss exactly one of the four 2×2 colors — i.e., covers exactly three distinct colors, with one repeated.\n\nHence total number of cells of the missing color across all tiles is 0, but rectangle has positive count ⇒ impossible.\n\nTherefore, **no rectangle can be tiled with T-tetrominoes**.\n\nHence for any $ n \\geq 1 $, number of tilings = 0.\n\nBut wait — is that accurate?\n\nLet me verify with a quick search in mind: Yes, it's a well-known result that the T-tetromino is not a rectangle-tile — see e.g., Golomb’s book or online resources.\n\nThus answer to Problem 2 is **0**.\n\nBut hold on — the Asymptote code might not be T.\n\nLet me double-check shape.\n\nAsymptote:\n\n```\ndraw((1,0)--(3,0)--(3,1)--(0,1)--(0,0)--(1,0)--(1,2)--(2,2)--(2,0));\n```\n\nLet’s list all line segments and infer filled squares.\n\nThe path seems to trace the outline of a polyomino. To find unit squares inside, use ray casting or just recognize that this is the **\"P\" tetromino?** No.\n\nAlternative idea: Count area enclosed.\n\nUsing shoelace formula on vertices (assuming non-self-intersecting polygon):\n\nVertices in order:\n\n1. (1,0)  \n2. (3,0)  \n3. (3,1)  \n4. (0,1)  \n5. (0,0)  \n6. (1,0) — back to start? But then continues to (1,2), so maybe it's two separate shapes? No, it's one draw command.\n\nActually, the path is:\n\n- (1,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (0,1) → (0,0) → (1,0): this closes a pentagon — a 3×1 rectangle from x=0–3, y=0–1, but with left part cut? From (0,1) to (0,0) to (1,0) to (1,0) — redundant.\n\nThen from (1,0) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,0): this is a 1×2 rectangle from x=1–2, y=0–2.\n\nSo combined shape is union of:\n\n- Rectangle A: x=0 to 3, y=0 to 1 → 3×1 = 3 squares? But x=0–3 is width 3 → squares (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) — yes.\n\n- Rectangle B: x=1 to 2, y=0 to 2 → height 2 → squares (1,0), (1,1) — but (1,0) already counted.\n\nSo total unique squares: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (1,1) — same as before.\n\nSo yes, T-tetromino.\n\nHence, no rectangle tiling possible ⇒ answer is 0.\n\nThus Problem 2 answer is **0**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers:\n\n- Problem 1: $ h = k + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4 $\n- Problem 2: $ 0 $\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The functional equation implies f(z+1) - f(z) is constant, say k.
