  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> Find two lines of symmetry of the graph of the function $ y = x + \\frac{1}{x} $. Express your answer as two equations of the form $ y = ax + b $. Instead of determining the equations of the lines of symmetry, simply find $ e = k + 1039 $, where $ k $ is the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote parallel to the y-axis, derived from the asymptotic analysis of the curve.\n\nLet’s parse carefully.\n\n- Function: $ y = x + \\frac{1}{x} $\n- Domain: $ x \\ne 0 $\n- Asymptotes:\n  - Vertical asymptote: occurs where denominator is zero → $ x = 0 $ (since $ \\frac{1}{x} $ blows up)\n  - Oblique (slant) asymptote: as $ x \\to \\pm\\infty $, $ \\frac{1}{x} \\to 0 $, so $ y \\sim x $, i.e., line $ y = x $ is an oblique asymptote.\n\nThe problem says: *“the asymptote parallel to the y-axis”* — that means a **vertical asymptote**, since vertical lines are parallel to the y-axis.\n\nSo the vertical asymptote is $ x = 0 $.\n\nNow, what is the “coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote”? The line $ x = 0 $ is not of the form $ y = ax + b $; it's a vertical line, which cannot be expressed in slope-intercept form. But perhaps they want us to write it in standard linear form: $ Ax + By + C = 0 $.\n\nStandard form of $ x = 0 $ is $ 1\\cdot x + 0\\cdot y + 0 = 0 $, so coefficient vector is $ (A, B, C) = (1, 0, 0) $. But Euclidean norm would be $ \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = 1 $. However, the problem says “coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote”, and maybe they mean just $ (A, B) $ for the normal vector? Or perhaps they consider the line as $ x = 0 $, and think of it as $ 1\\cdot x + 0\\cdot y = 0 $, so coefficient vector $ (1, 0) $, norm = 1.\n\nBut let’s double-check: Is there any other asymptote parallel to the y-axis? No — only $ x = 0 $.\n\nSo $ k = \\text{Euclidean norm of coefficient vector of } x = 0 $.\n\nIf written as $ x = 0 $, the \"coefficients\" of $ x $ and $ y $ in $ x + 0y = 0 $ are $ (1, 0) $, norm = $ \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 1 $.\n\nThus $ k = 1 $, so $ e = k + 1039 = 1 + 1039 = 1040 $.\n\nWait — but the problem says: *“Instead of determining the equations of the lines of symmetry, simply find $ e = k + 1039 $…”* So we don’t need to find the symmetry lines — just compute $ e $.\n\nSo answer to Problem 1 is **1040**.\n\nHold on — is there any trick? Let's verify symmetry lines quickly, just to ensure no misinterpretation.\n\nFunction: $ y = x + \\frac{1}{x} $\n\nCheck symmetry:\n\n- Is it symmetric about $ y = x $? Let's test: swapping $ x $ and $ y $ gives $ x = y + \\frac{1}{y} $ → multiply both sides by $ y $: $ xy = y^2 + 1 $ → $ y^2 - xy + 1 = 0 $. Not obviously same curve. But actually, the curve $ y = x + \\frac{1}{x} $ is symmetric about the line $ y = x $, because if $ (a, b) $ lies on it, then $ b = a + \\frac{1}{a} $. Does $ (b, a) $ lie on it? Check if $ a = b + \\frac{1}{b} $? Not generally true. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, consider transformation: Let $ u = x $, $ v = y $. The curve satisfies $ xy = x^2 + 1 $ → $ x^2 - xy + 1 = 0 $. This is a quadratic curve. Its general conic form: $ x^2 - xy + 0y^2 + 0x + 0y + 1 = 0 $. Discriminant $ B^2 - 4AC = (-1)^2 - 4(1)(0) = 1 > 0 $, so it's a hyperbola. Hyperbolas have two lines of symmetry: the transverse and conjugate axes — i.e., the two angle bisectors of asymptotes.\n\nAsymptotes of $ y = x + \\frac{1}{x} $: as $ x \\to 0 $, $ y \\to \\pm\\infty $, vertical asymptote $ x = 0 $; as $ x \\to \\pm\\infty $, $ y \\sim x $, so oblique asymptote $ y = x $. So asymptotes are $ x = 0 $ and $ y = x $. These intersect at origin. The angle between them is 45°, so symmetry axes should be the angle bisectors.\n\nLines through origin: one asymptote is vertical ($ x = 0 $), direction vector $ (0,1) $; other is $ y = x $, direction vector $ (1,1) $. Angle bisectors can be found by unit vectors:\n\n- Unit vector along $ x = 0 $ (i.e., y-axis): $ \\mathbf{u} = (0,1) $\n- Unit vector along $ y = x $: $ \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,1) $\n\nSum: $ \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},\\ 1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) $ → slope = $ \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\sqrt{2} + 1 $. That seems messy.\n\nBut perhaps simpler: For hyperbola $ xy = 1 $, symmetry lines are $ y = x $ and $ y = -x $. Our curve is $ y = x + \\frac{1}{x} \\implies y - x = \\frac{1}{x} \\implies (y - x)x = 1 \\implies xy - x^2 = 1 $. Not same.\n\nBut regardless — the problem says *“instead of determining the equations… simply find e = k + 1039”*, and defines $ k $ as Euclidean norm of coefficient vector in equation of asymptote parallel to y-axis.\n\nThat asymptote is $ x = 0 $. To write as linear equation: $ 1\\cdot x + 0\\cdot y = 0 $. Coefficient vector for $ (x, y) $ is $ (1, 0) $, norm = 1.\n\nSo $ k = 1 $, $ e = 1040 $.\n\n✅ So answer_1 = \"1040\"\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> Determine all triplets of real numbers $ (x, y, z) $ satisfying the system:\n> \n> (1) $ x^{2} y + y^{2} z = 1040 $  \n> (2) $ x^{2} z + z^{2} y = 260 $  \n> (3) $ (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) = -540 $\n\nWe need to find all real solutions $ (x, y, z) $.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nEquation (1): $ x^2 y + y^2 z = 1040 $  \nEquation (2): $ x^2 z + z^2 y = 260 $  \nEquation (3): $ (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) = -540 $\n\nNote: $ (x-y)(y-z)(z-x) = -(x-y)(y-z)(x-z) $, and it's alternating — changes sign under swap.\n\nObservation: Both (1) and (2) share terms with $ x^2 $, $ y $, $ z $, and $ y^2 z $, $ z^2 y $. Perhaps factor something?\n\nLet’s try to subtract or manipulate.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nLet’s factor $ y $ from (1): $ y(x^2 + y z) = 1040 $  \nSimilarly, (2): $ z(x^2 + y z) = 260 $\n\nWhoa! Check:\n\n(1): $ x^2 y + y^2 z = y x^2 + y^2 z = y(x^2 + y z) $ ✅  \n(2): $ x^2 z + z^2 y = z x^2 + y z^2 = z(x^2 + y z) $ ✅\n\nYes! So both left-hand sides share common factor $ (x^2 + y z) $.\n\nLet $ A = x^2 + y z $. Then:\n\n- $ y A = 1040 $ → (1')  \n- $ z A = 260 $ → (2')\n\nAssuming $ A \\ne 0 $, we can divide:\n\nFrom (1') and (2'): $ \\frac{y A}{z A} = \\frac{1040}{260} = 4 \\Rightarrow \\frac{y}{z} = 4 \\Rightarrow y = 4z $\n\nAlso, from (2'): $ z A = 260 \\Rightarrow A = \\frac{260}{z} $, provided $ z \\ne 0 $\n\nThen from (1'): $ y A = 4z \\cdot \\frac{260}{z} = 4 \\cdot 260 = 1040 $ ✅ consistent.\n\nSo $ y = 4z $, and $ A = x^2 + y z = x^2 + (4z) z = x^2 + 4z^2 = \\frac{260}{z} $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nx^2 + 4z^2 = \\frac{260}{z} \\quad \\text{(4)}\n$$\n\nAlso, equation (3): $ (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) = -540 $\n\nSubstitute $ y = 4z $:\n\n- $ x - y = x - 4z $\n- $ y - z = 4z - z = 3z $\n- $ z - x = -(x - z) $\n\nSo product:\n\n$$\n(x - 4z)(3z)(z - x) = -540\n$$\n\nNote $ (z - x) = -(x - z) $, so:\n\n$$\n(x - 4z)(3z)(-1)(x - z) = -540 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow -3z (x - 4z)(x - z) = -540 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 3z (x - 4z)(x - z) = 540 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow z (x - 4z)(x - z) = 180 \\quad \\text{(5)}\n$$\n\nNow we have two equations: (4) and (5), in variables $ x $ and $ z $.\n\nLet’s try to find integer solutions — given RHS are integers (1040, 260, 540), likely integer or rational solutions.\n\nAssume $ z $ is a nonzero rational number; try small integer values for $ z $.\n\nTry $ z = 1 $:\n\n- From (4): $ x^2 + 4(1)^2 = 260/1 = 260 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 256 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm 16 $\n- Check (5): $ z(x - 4z)(x - z) = 1 \\cdot (x - 4)(x - 1) = 180 $\n\nTest $ x = 16 $: $ (16 - 4)(16 - 1) = 12 \\cdot 15 = 180 $ ✅\n\nSo $ x = 16, z = 1, y = 4z = 4 $\n\nTriplet: $ (x, y, z) = (16, 4, 1) $\n\nCheck original equations:\n\n(1) $ x^2 y + y^2 z = 256 \\cdot 4 + 16 \\cdot 1 = 1024 + 16 = 1040 $ ✅  \n(2) $ x^2 z + z^2 y = 256 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 4 = 256 + 4 = 260 $ ✅  \n(3) $ (16 - 4)(4 - 1)(1 - 16) = (12)(3)(-15) = 36 \\cdot (-15) = -540 $ ✅\n\nGreat.\n\nNow check $ x = -16, z = 1 $:\n\nThen $ x^2 = 256 $, OK for (4). But (5): $ (x - 4)(x - 1) = (-16 - 4)(-16 - 1) = (-20)(-17) = 340 $, times $ z = 1 $ → 340 ≠ 180. So discard.\n\nTry $ z = 2 $:\n\n(4): $ x^2 + 4*(4) = x^2 + 16 = 260 / 2 = 130 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 114 $, not perfect square, but maybe ok? Check (5): $ z(x - 4z)(x - z) = 2(x - 8)(x - 2) = 180 \\Rightarrow (x - 8)(x - 2) = 90 $\n\nSolve: $ x^2 -10x + 16 = 90 \\Rightarrow x^2 -10x -74 = 0 $, discriminant $ 100 + 296 = 396 $, not square → irrational. Possible, but maybe not intended. Let's hold.\n\nTry $ z = 5 $: then $ A = 260 / 5 = 52 $, and $ x^2 + 4*25 = x^2 + 100 = 52 \\Rightarrow x^2 = -48 $, invalid.\n\n$ z = -1 $:\n\nThen $ y = 4z = -4 $\n\n(4): $ x^2 + 4(1) = 260 / (-1) = -260 \\Rightarrow x^2 = -264 $, invalid.\n\n$ z = 4 $: $ A = 260 / 4 = 65 $, $ x^2 + 4*16 = x^2 + 64 = 65 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm 1 $\n\nCheck (5): $ z(x - 4z)(x - z) = 4(x - 16)(x - 4) = 180 \\Rightarrow (x - 16)(x - 4) = 45 $\n\nIf $ x = 1 $: $ (-15)(-3) = 45 $ ✅\n\nSo $ x = 1, z = 4, y = 16 $\n\nTriplet: $ (1, 16, 4) $\n\nCheck original:\n\n(1) $ x^2 y + y^2 z = 1^2 * 16 + 256 * 4 = 16 + 1024 = 1040 $ ✅  \n(2) $ x^2 z + z^2 y = 1 * 4 + 16 * 16 = 4 + 256 = 260 $ ✅  \n(3) $ (1 - 16)(16 - 4)(4 - 1) = (-15)(12)(3) = -540 $ ✅\n\nSo $ (1, 16, 4) $ is also a solution.\n\nNotice this is a cyclic permutation? Let's see: previous was $ (16, 4, 1) $, now $ (1, 16, 4) $. Indeed, it's a cyclic shift: $ (x, y, z) \\to (z, x, y) $ or something? Let's check mapping.\n\nFrom $ (16, 4, 1) $, if we do $ (x, y, z) \\mapsto (y, z, x) = (4, 1, 16) $, is that a solution?\n\nTest $ (4, 1, 16) $:\n\n(1) $ x^2 y + y^2 z = 16 * 1 + 1 * 16 = 16 + 16 = 32 \\ne 1040 $. So no.\n\nBut $ (1, 16, 4) $ works. How is it related?\n\nIn our derivation, we assumed $ A \\ne 0 $ and divided, got $ y = 4z $. So all solutions must satisfy $ y = 4z $. So $ (1, 16, 4) $ has $ y = 16, z = 4 $, so $ y = 4z = 16 $, yes.\n\nSo $ z = 4, y = 16, x = 1 $ satisfies $ y = 4z $.\n\nAre there more?\n\nFrom earlier, with $ y = 4z $, and equation (4): $ x^2 = \\frac{260}{z} - 4z^2 $\n\nAnd (5): $ z(x - 4z)(x - z) = 180 $\n\nLet’s treat $ z $ as parameter and solve.\n\nLet $ z \\ne 0 $. Let’s set $ u = x $. Then:\n\nFrom (4): $ u^2 = \\frac{260}{z} - 4z^2 $ → requires RHS ≥ 0.\n\nFrom (5): $ z(u - 4z)(u - z) = 180 $\n\nLet’s expand (5):\n\n$ z[ u^2 - 5z u + 4z^2 ] = 180 $  \n→ $ z u^2 - 5z^2 u + 4z^3 = 180 $\n\nNow substitute $ u^2 = \\frac{260}{z} - 4z^2 $:\n\nThen $ z u^2 = z \\cdot \\left( \\frac{260}{z} - 4z^2 \\right) = 260 - 4z^3 $\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n$ (260 - 4z^3) - 5z^2 u + 4z^3 = 180 $  \nSimplify: $ 260 - 5z^2 u = 180 $  \n→ $ -5z^2 u = -80 $  \n→ $ 5z^2 u = 80 $  \n→ $ u = \\frac{80}{5z^2} = \\frac{16}{z^2} $\n\nSo $ x = \\frac{16}{z^2} $\n\nGreat! So $ x = \\frac{16}{z^2} $\n\nNow plug into (4):\n\n$ x^2 + 4z^2 = \\frac{260}{z} $  \n→ $ \\left( \\frac{16}{z^2} \\right)^2 + 4z^2 = \\frac{260}{z} $  \n→ $ \\frac{256}{z^4} + 4z^2 = \\frac{260}{z} $\n\nMultiply both sides by $ z^4 $ (since $ z \\ne 0 $):\n\n$ 256 + 4z^6 = 260 z^3 $\n\nBring all to one side:\n\n$ 4z^6 - 260 z^3 + 256 = 0 $\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n$ z^6 - 65 z^3 + 64 = 0 $\n\nLet $ w = z^3 $. Then:\n\n$ w^2 - 65 w + 64 = 0 $\n\nSolve quadratic:\n\nDiscriminant: $ 65^2 - 4*64 = 4225 - 256 = 3969 = 63^2 $ (since $ 63^2 = 3969 $)\n\nSo $ w = \\frac{65 \\pm 63}{2} $\n\n→ $ w_1 = \\frac{65 + 63}{2} = \\frac{128}{2} = 64 $  \n→ $ w_2 = \\frac{65 - 63}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 $\n\nSo $ z^3 = 64 $ or $ z^3 = 1 $\n\nReal solutions:\n\n- $ z^3 = 1 \\Rightarrow z = 1 $\n- $ z^3 = 64 \\Rightarrow z = 4 $\n\n(Only real cube roots considered, since we want real $ x,y,z $.)\n\nSo $ z = 1 $ or $ z = 4 $\n\nThen:\n\n- If $ z = 1 $: $ y = 4z = 4 $, $ x = \\frac{16}{z^2} = 16 $ → $ (16, 4, 1) $\n- If $ z = 4 $: $ y = 16 $, $ x = \\frac{16}{16} = 1 $ → $ (1, 16, 4) $\n\nAre there any other real solutions? What if $ A = 0 $? Earlier we assumed $ A \\ne 0 $ to divide.\n\nCheck case $ A = x^2 + y z = 0 $\n\nThen from (1): $ y A = 0 = 1040 $ → contradiction. So $ A \\ne 0 $ necessarily.\n\nThus only two real solutions.\n\nBut wait — the problem asks for *all triplets*. Are permutations possible? Let's see if other orderings satisfy.\n\nSuppose we try assuming other relations — e.g., could $ x = 4y $ or something? But our derivation came from factoring common $ A $, which is inherent in the structure of equations (1) and (2). Since we didn’t assume ordering, and derived $ y = 4z $ necessarily from the ratio, these are the only possibilities.\n\nHence only two real triplets: $ (16, 4, 1) $ and $ (1, 16, 4) $\n\nBut wait — check if $ (4, 1, 16) $ works? Already did — no.\n\nWhat about $ z = 1 $ gave $ x = 16 $, $ y = 4 $. Is there a solution with negative $ z $? $ z^3 = 1 $ or $ 64 $ have only one real root each (positive), since cube root is bijective on reals. So no negative $ z $.\n\nThus only two real solutions.\n\nBut let’s verify if both satisfy all equations — already did.\n\nSo answer to Problem 2 is the set of two triplets: $ (16, 4, 1) $ and $ (1, 16, 4) $\n\nHow to format answer? The problem says “Determine all triplets”, so list them.\n\nIn JSON, likely as a list of lists.\n\nBut the instruction says: *“Put ONLY the answer value in the quotes (no explanations, no units unless part of the answer, no LaTeX formatting)”*, and *“For text answers, provide the exact text”*\n\nSo probably represent as list of lists: `[[16, 4, 1], [1, 16, 4]]`\n\nBut need to confirm ordering — are there more?\n\nWait, what if we consider $ z^3 = 1 $ has complex roots, but we only want real numbers, so only $ z = 1 $. Same for 64.\n\nSo yes, only two.\n\nThus answer_2 = `\"[[16, 4, 1], [1, 16, 4]]\"` — but need to check if order matters or if they expect sorted somehow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want all permutations? But only these two satisfy the equations.\n\nLet’s test $ (4, 1, 16) $ again explicitly:\n\nEq1: $ x^2 y + y^2 z = 16 * 1 + 1 * 16 = 16 + 16 = 32 \\ne 1040 $. So no.\n\nSo only those two.\n\nHence final answers:\n\n- answer_1 = \"1040\"\n- answer_2 = \"[[16, 4, 1], [1, 16, 4]]\"\n\nBut in JSON, strings must be quoted. So inside the JSON, the value for answer_2 is a string containing that representation.\n\nYes, per instructions: “Put ONLY the answer value in the quotes”.\n\nSo answer_2 is the string `\"[[16, 4, 1], [1, 16, 4]]\"`\n\n✅\n\n---\n\n### Final JSON:\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The function y = x + 1/x has a vertical asymptote at x = 0.
