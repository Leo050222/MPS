  "reasoning_content": "Let's solve each problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 1:**\n\nWe have 5 people: Marcus and four relatives → total of 5 people.\n\nEach pair is either friends or enemies. So the relationship graph is a complete graph K₅, with edges colored red (friends) or blue (enemies), say.\n\nCondition: *For any two enemies, there is no person that they are both friends with.*\n\nThat is: If persons A and B are enemies, then there is **no** person C such that C is friends with both A and B.\n\nIn graph-theoretic terms:\n\n- Let G be the friendship graph on 5 vertices: an edge between u and v means they are friends.\n- Then the enemy relation is the complement graph: edge in complement = enemies.\n\nThe condition says: For any non-edge {A,B} in G (i.e., A and B are enemies), there is **no common neighbor** of A and B in G.\n\nThat is: In G, every pair of non-adjacent vertices has **no common neighbor**, i.e., their neighborhoods are disjoint.\n\nSo G is a graph on 5 vertices such that for any non-edge uv, N(u) ∩ N(v) = ∅.\n\nWe are told to compute q = s − 1, where s is the number of such assignments in which **no two people are friends**, i.e., the friendship graph has **zero edges**.\n\nSo s is the number of valid configurations where the friendship graph is empty.\n\nBut wait — the problem says:\n\n> Instead of determining the total number of valid friendship and enmity assignments among the five people, simply find q = s − 1, where s is the number of such assignments in which no two people are friends.\n\nSo we only need to count how many assignments satisfy the condition *and* have no friendships — i.e., all pairs are enemies.\n\nSo: All 5 people are pairwise enemies. Is this assignment valid? Let's check the condition.\n\nCondition: For any two enemies, there is no person that they are both friends with.\n\nIf there are **no friends at all**, then for any two enemies A and B, is there a person C who is friends with both A and B? No — because there are no friendships at all ⇒ no such C exists.\n\nSo the condition is vacuously satisfied.\n\nThus, the all-enemies configuration is valid.\n\nHow many such assignments are there? Only **one**: all C(5,2) = 10 pairs are enemies; no friendships.\n\nSo s = 1 ⇒ q = s − 1 = 0.\n\nWait — but hold on: Are there other assignments with no friendships? No — “no two people are friends” means the friendship set is empty — only one such assignment.\n\nBut let’s double-check if the condition could be violated in the all-enemies case.\n\nTake any two enemies — say A and B. Is there a person C such that C is friends with both A and B? Since no one is friends with anyone, answer is no. So condition holds.\n\nHence s = 1 ⇒ q = 0.\n\nBut wait — is there any subtlety? The problem says “each pair of the five people are either friends or enemies”. So it's a complete partition: for each unordered pair, exactly one of friend/enemy. So yes, the all-enemy assignment is unique.\n\nSo answer to Problem 1 is 0.\n\nHold on — maybe I misread. Let me re-read:\n\n> For any two enemies, there is no person that they are both friends with.\n\nYes — that’s equivalent to: no vertex is adjacent (in friendship graph) to both endpoints of a non-edge.\n\nThat’s the definition of a graph with no induced subgraph isomorphic to P₃? Or something else?\n\nBut for our purpose, we only need s = number of valid assignments with *no friendships*, i.e., empty friendship graph.\n\nOnly one such graph. And it satisfies condition. So s = 1 ⇒ q = 0.\n\nSo answer_1 = \"0\"\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2:** Count lattice points *strictly inside* the triangle with vertices A = (0,99), B = (5,100), C = (2003,500). Do **not** count boundary points.\n\nWe need interior lattice points only.\n\nUse **Pick’s Theorem**: For a simple lattice polygon,\n\nArea = I + B/2 − 1,\n\nwhere I = number of interior lattice points, B = number of boundary lattice points.\n\nSo I = Area − B/2 + 1.\n\nSo we need:\n\n- Area of triangle ABC\n- Number of lattice points on the boundary (i.e., on the three edges AB, BC, CA, counting vertices only once)\n\nStep 1: Compute area.\n\nUsing shoelace formula:\n\nVertices: (x₁,y₁) = (0,99), (x₂,y₂) = (5,100), (x₃,y₃) = (2003,500)\n\nArea = |(x₁(y₂−y₃) + x₂(y₃−y₁) + x₃(y₁−y₂))| / 2\n\nCompute:\n\ny₂ − y₃ = 100 − 500 = −400  \nx₁(y₂−y₃) = 0 × (−400) = 0\n\ny₃ − y₁ = 500 − 99 = 401  \nx₂(y₃−y₁) = 5 × 401 = 2005\n\ny₁ − y₂ = 99 − 100 = −1  \nx₃(y₁−y₂) = 2003 × (−1) = −2003\n\nSum = 0 + 2005 − 2003 = 2\n\nAbsolute value = 2 ⇒ Area = 2 / 2 = 1\n\nWait — area = 1? That seems suspiciously small given the large coordinates.\n\nLet me recalculate carefully.\n\nShoelace formula:\n\nList points in order, repeat first:\n\nx   y  \n0   99  \n5   100  \n2003 500  \n0   99  \n\nSum of x_i y_{i+1}:  \n0×100 = 0  \n5×500 = 2500  \n2003×99 = ?\n\nCompute 2003×99 = 2003×(100−1) = 200300 − 2003 = 198297\n\nSo sum1 = 0 + 2500 + 198297 = 200797\n\nSum of y_i x_{i+1}:  \n99×5 = 495  \n100×2003 = 200300  \n500×0 = 0  \nSum2 = 495 + 200300 + 0 = 200795\n\nThen area = |sum1 − sum2| / 2 = |200797 − 200795| / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1.\n\nYes! Area = 1.\n\nThat’s surprising but algebraically correct. Let's sanity-check geometry.\n\nPoints: A(0,99), B(5,100), C(2003,500)\n\nVector AB = (5,1), vector AC = (2003,401)\n\nCross product AB × AC = 5×401 − 1×2003 = 2005 − 2003 = 2 ⇒ area = |2|/2 = 1.\n\nYes! So triangle has area 1.\n\nNow, Pick’s theorem: I = Area − B/2 + 1 = 1 − B/2 + 1 = 2 − B/2.\n\nSo I = 2 − B/2 ⇒ must be integer ⇒ B must be even.\n\nSo we need B = number of lattice points on the boundary.\n\nBoundary consists of three line segments: AB, BC, CA.\n\nNumber of lattice points on a segment from (x₁,y₁) to (x₂,y₂) inclusive is:\n\ngcd(|x₂−x₁|, |y₂−y₁|) + 1.\n\nSo compute for each edge:\n\n1. AB: from (0,99) to (5,100)\n\nΔx = 5, Δy = 1 ⇒ gcd(5,1) = 1 ⇒ points = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nIndeed, only endpoints — no interior lattice points.\n\n2. BC: from (5,100) to (2003,500)\n\nΔx = 2003 − 5 = 1998  \nΔy = 500 − 100 = 400  \ngcd(1998, 400)\n\nCompute gcd(1998, 400):\n\n1998 ÷ 400 = 4×400 = 1600, remainder 398  \ngcd(400, 398)  \n400 − 398 = 2  \ngcd(398, 2) = 2, since 398 even.\n\nSo gcd = 2 ⇒ number of lattice points on BC = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThat includes endpoints B and C, and one interior lattice point.\n\n3. CA: from (2003,500) to (0,99)\n\nΔx = 2003, Δy = 500 − 99 = 401  \ngcd(2003, 401)\n\nCheck if 401 divides 2003: 401×5 = 2005 → too big; 401×4 = 1604, 2003−1604 = 399  \nSo gcd(2003,401) = gcd(401, 399)  \n401 − 399 = 2  \ngcd(399,2): 399 odd ⇒ gcd = 1\n\nSo gcd = 1 ⇒ points on CA = 1 + 1 = 2 (only endpoints)\n\nNow total boundary points B = (points on AB) + (points on BC) + (points on CA) − 3 (since each vertex counted twice)\n\nBecause each vertex belongs to two edges.\n\nSo:\n\nAB contributes 2 points: A, B  \nBC contributes 3 points: B, X, C  \nCA contributes 2 points: C, A  \n\nSo total distinct boundary points = {A, B, C, X} = 4 points.\n\nLet’s list:\n\n- AB: A, B  \n- BC: B, (some interior point), C → call it D  \n- CA: C, A  \n\nSo set = {A, B, C, D} → 4 points.\n\nThus B = 4.\n\nCheck via formula:\n\nB = (AB_pts + BC_pts + CA_pts) − 3 = (2 + 3 + 2) − 3 = 7 − 3 = 4. Yes.\n\nSo B = 4.\n\nThen I = Area − B/2 + 1 = 1 − 4/2 + 1 = 1 − 2 + 1 = 0.\n\nSo zero interior lattice points.\n\nIs that possible? Triangle of area 1 with only 4 boundary lattice points — yes, e.g., a very thin triangle.\n\nIndeed, since area is 1, and minimal area for a lattice triangle is 1/2 (by Pick or determinant), but here it's 1, and with only 4 boundary points, I = 0 is consistent.\n\nSo answer_2 = \"0\"\n\nWait — but let me double-check BC gcd again.\n\nB = (5,100), C = (2003,500)\n\nΔx = 1998, Δy = 400\n\nWe computed gcd(1998,400):\n\n1998 mod 400 = 1998 − 4×400 = 1998 − 1600 = 398  \n400 mod 398 = 2  \n398 mod 2 = 0 ⇒ gcd = 2. Correct.\n\nSo points on BC = gcd + 1 = 3 ⇒ includes B, one interior, C.\n\nAB: Δx=5, Δy=1 ⇒ gcd=1 ⇒ 2 points.\n\nCA: Δx=2003, Δy=401.\n\n2003 and 401: is 401 prime? Yes, 401 is prime.\n\nDoes 401 divide 2003? 401×5 = 2005, so no. So gcd = 1. Correct.\n\nSo B = 4.\n\nI = 1 − 4/2 + 1 = 0.\n\nThus answer_2 = \"0\"\n\n---\n\nFinal answers:\n\nanswer_1 = \"0\"  \nanswer_2 = \"0\"\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The condition requires that for any two enemies, no third person is friends with both. When no two people are friends (all pairs are enemies), the condition is vacuously satisfied because there are no friendships at all. There is exactly one such assignment (the empty friendship graph), so s = 1 and q = s - 1 = 0. Problem 2: Using the shoelace formula, the area of the triangle with vertices (0,99), (5,100), and (2003,500) is 1. The number of boundary lattice points is calculated by summing lattice points on each edge using gcd: AB has gcd(5,1)+1 = 2 points, BC has gcd(1998,400)+1 = 3 points, CA has gcd(2003,401)+1 = 2 points. Subtracting double-counted vertices gives total boundary points B = (2+3+2)-3 = 4. By Pick's Theorem, interior points I = Area - B/2 + 1 = 1 - 4/2 + 1 = 0.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"0\"\n}",
