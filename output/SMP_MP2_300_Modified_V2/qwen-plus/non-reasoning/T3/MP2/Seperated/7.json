Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**:  \n*How many graphs are there on 10 vertices labeled $1,2,\\ldots,10$ such that there are exactly 23 edges and no triangles? Instead of counting the total number of triangle-free graphs with exactly 23 edges on the given labeled vertices, simply find $m = N_{\\Delta=5} - 37798$, where $N_{\\Delta=5}$ is the number of such graphs where the maximum degree is exactly 5.*\n\nThis problem seems to be referencing a known enumeration or a contest-style problem where the value $N_{\\Delta=5}$ is either known or derivable from constraints.\n\nLet’s analyze:\n\n- Graphs on 10 labeled vertices, exactly 23 edges, triangle-free, and max degree exactly 5.\n\nTotal possible edges among 10 vertices: $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$. So 23 edges is just under half — not sparse, but not dense.\n\nTriangle-free graphs on $n$ vertices with given number of edges — this is highly nontrivial to count directly. But the problem says “instead of counting the total… simply find $m = N_{\\Delta=5} - 37798$”.\n\nThat suggests that $N_{\\Delta=5}$ is a known or computable integer, and perhaps this problem appears in a known source (e.g., an old contest or OEIS), and the subtraction yields a nice number.\n\nLet’s consider extremal graph theory: Mantel’s theorem says the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices is $\\lfloor n^2/4 \\rfloor$. For $n = 10$, that’s $\\lfloor 100/4 \\rfloor = 25$. So 23 edges is *two less than the Turán number* — i.e., near-maximal triangle-free graphs.\n\nSo triangle-free graphs on 10 vertices with 23 edges are \"almost complete bipartite\" — likely close to $K_{5,5}$, which has 25 edges and is bipartite (hence triangle-free). Removing 2 edges from $K_{5,5}$ gives a triangle-free graph with 23 edges.\n\nBut $K_{5,5}$ has all degrees equal to 5. So its degree sequence is ten 5s. Removing an edge reduces degrees of two vertices (one in each part) from 5 to 4. So max degree remains 5 unless we remove *all* edges incident to a vertex — but we only remove 2 edges.\n\nSo most 23-edge subgraphs of $K_{5,5}$ still have max degree 5.\n\nBut there may be other triangle-free graphs with 23 edges not contained in a balanced complete bipartite graph — e.g., $K_{4,6}$ has $4 \\cdot 6 = 24$ edges, also triangle-free; degrees: four vertices degree 6, six vertices degree 4 → max degree 6. So $K_{4,6}$ has max degree 6, so not counted in $N_{\\Delta=5}$. Similarly, $K_{3,7} = 21$ edges < 23.\n\nSo to get 23 edges and max degree ≤ 5, the graph must be quite regular.\n\nLet’s suppose the graph is *5-regular*: 10 vertices, each degree 5 ⇒ sum of degrees = 50 ⇒ number of edges = 25. Too many.\n\nWe need 23 edges ⇒ sum of degrees = 46.\n\nSo average degree = 4.6.\n\nIf max degree is exactly 5, then some vertices have degree 5, others less.\n\nLet $x$ = number of vertices of degree 5. Then remaining $10 - x$ vertices have degree ≤ 4.\n\nSum of degrees = 46.\n\nSo:\n$$\n5x + \\sum_{\\text{others}} \\deg(v) = 46, \\quad \\text{where each other } \\deg(v) \\le 4.\n$$\n\nMax possible sum for others is $4(10 - x) = 40 - 4x$. So total sum ≤ $5x + 40 - 4x = x + 40$. Set ≥ 46 ⇒ $x + 40 \\ge 46 \\Rightarrow x \\ge 6$.\n\nAlso, min possible sum for others is (say) 0, but realistically, since total is 46 and x vertices contribute 5x, others contribute $46 - 5x$, which must be ≥ 0 ⇒ $x \\le 9$ (since 5×9 = 45, need 1 more from others).\n\nSo $x \\in \\{6,7,8,9\\}$.\n\n- If $x = 6$: sum from degree-5 vertices = 30 ⇒ remaining 4 vertices must sum to 16 ⇒ average 4 ⇒ possible if all are degree 4.\n\n- If $x = 7$: 35 ⇒ remaining 3 must sum to 11 ⇒ avg ~3.67 ⇒ possible (e.g., 4,4,3)\n\n- $x = 8$: 40 ⇒ remaining 2 sum to 6 ⇒ e.g., 3,3 or 4,2\n\n- $x = 9$: 45 ⇒ remaining 1 must be degree 1.\n\nSo many degree sequences possible.\n\nBut counting triangle-free graphs with given degree sequence and labeled vertices is extremely hard without computation.\n\nGiven the problem asks for $N_{\\Delta=5} - 37798$, and expects a simple answer, it's likely that $N_{\\Delta=5}$ is a known value from literature or a past competition.\n\nLet me search my knowledge: Is there a known count of triangle-free graphs on 10 vertices with 23 edges and max degree exactly 5?\n\nAlternatively — maybe this is from the 2022 AIME or similar? Unlikely.\n\nWait — perhaps this is a trick: maybe *no* triangle-free graph on 10 vertices with 23 edges can have maximum degree less than 5? Or maybe all such graphs must have max degree at least 5, and the number with max degree *exactly* 5 is known.\n\nBut again, this seems too specific.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the problem is misdirection, and actually $N_{\\Delta=5} = 37798$, so $m = 0$? But why would they phrase it that way?\n\nOr perhaps it's from a database: The number of triangle-free graphs on 10 labeled vertices with 23 edges is known; and among them, those with max degree exactly 5 is $N_{\\Delta=5} = 37798 + m$, and maybe $m = 0$ or small.\n\nWait — let's estimate total number of triangle-free graphs with 23 edges on 10 vertices.\n\nTotal number of graphs with 23 edges: $\\binom{45}{23} \\approx 2.0 \\times 10^{12}$ — huge.\n\nBut triangle-free is a strong restriction.\n\nHowever, near the Turán threshold, almost all triangle-free graphs with many edges are bipartite (Erdős–Simonovits stability), so likely bipartite.\n\nSo consider bipartite graphs on 10 labeled vertices with 23 edges.\n\nA bipartite graph is defined by a partition $V = A \\cup B$, $|A| = a$, $|B| = 10-a$, max edges $a(10-a)$. Max at $a = 5$: 25 edges.\n\nSo to have 23 edges, we need partitions where $a(10-a) \\ge 23$.\n\nSolve $a(10-a) \\ge 23$ ⇒ $10a - a^2 \\ge 23$ ⇒ $a^2 -10a +23 \\le 0$. Roots: $a = [10 ± \\sqrt{100 - 92}]/2 = [10 ± \\sqrt{8}]/2 ≈ [10 ± 2.828]/2 ⇒ a ∈ [3.586, 6.414]$. So integer $a = 4,5,6$.\n\n- $a = 4$, $b = 6$: max edges = 24 ⇒ can have 23 edges.\n\n- $a = 5$, $b = 5$: max = 25 ⇒ can have 23.\n\n- $a = 6$, $b = 4$: same as $a = 4$.\n\nSo possible bipartitions: sizes (4,6) and (5,5).\n\nNow, for each unordered partition, count number of ways to choose 23 edges between parts.\n\nBut vertices are labeled, so partitions are *labeled*: choosing which 4 vertices go to A matters.\n\n- Number of ways to choose $A$ of size 4: $\\binom{10}{4} = 210$. For each, number of bipartite graphs with 23 edges between A and B: $\\binom{24}{23} = 24$. So total for (4,6)-type: $210 \\times 24 = 5040$.\n\n- For (5,5): $\\binom{10}{5} = 252$ ways to choose A. Each allows $\\binom{25}{23} = \\binom{25}{2} = 300$ graphs. So $252 \\times 300 = 75600$.\n\nBut wait — this counts *bipartite* graphs, which are triangle-free, but overcounts? Because a graph may be bipartite in more than one way? For example, if a graph is complete bipartite $K_{5,5}$, it has a unique bipartition (since it's complete bipartite and connected and balanced). But some graphs may admit multiple bipartitions — e.g., empty graph has many. But with 23 edges, likely connected and uniquely bipartite if bipartite.\n\nHowever, crucially: not all triangle-free graphs are bipartite! There exist triangle-free non-bipartite graphs (e.g., pentagon $C_5$), but with 23 edges on 10 vertices, girth constraints may force bipartiteness? Not necessarily — e.g., you could have $C_5$ plus many edges carefully added.\n\nBut perhaps for maximal edge count near 25, all triangle-free graphs are bipartite — known result? Yes: the stability theorem says that any triangle-free graph with more than $(1/4 - \\epsilon)n^2$ edges is close to bipartite. Here $23/25 = 0.92$ of extremal, so very close — likely all are bipartite. In fact, it's known that for $n = 10$, the only triangle-free graphs with 24 or 25 edges are the complete bipartite ones $K_{4,6}$ and $K_{5,5}$. What about 23?\n\nLet’s verify: $K_{4,6}$ has 24 edges; remove one edge → 23 edges, max degree: in $K_{4,6}$, degrees are 6 (for the 4-vertex side) and 4 (for the 6-vertex side). So max degree = 6. So such graphs have $\\Delta = 6$, not 5.\n\nSimilarly, $K_{5,5}$ has all degrees 5; remove two edges: if we remove two edges incident to distinct vertices on same side, say both from left side, then two left vertices go from degree 5 to 4, others remain 5 ⇒ max degree still 5. If we remove two edges sharing a vertex, say both incident to same left vertex, then that vertex degree drops to 3, others unchanged ⇒ still max degree 5.\n\nSo all 23-edge subgraphs of $K_{5,5}$ have $\\Delta = 5$.\n\nHow many such subgraphs? $\\binom{25}{23} = \\binom{25}{2} = 300$ per fixed $K_{5,5}$ partition.\n\nNumber of ways to choose a 5–5 partition: $\\binom{10}{5}/2 = 126$, because $\\{A,B\\}$ and $\\{B,A\\}$ give same complete bipartite graph. Wait — but in our case, the graph is *labeled*, and the partition is determined by the graph only if it's complete bipartite. But when we take a *subgraph*, the bipartition may not be unique.\n\nHowever, for counting $N_{\\Delta=5}$, we need graphs that are triangle-free, 23 edges, and max degree *exactly* 5.\n\nFrom above:\n\n- Any subgraph of $K_{5,5}$ with 23 edges has max degree at most 5, and since original degrees are all 5, and we remove only 2 edges, at least three vertices retain degree 5 (actually, at least 5 vertices do — because removing two edges affects at most 4 vertices, so at least 6 vertices keep degree 5). So max degree is exactly 5.\n\n- Subgraphs of $K_{4,6}$ with 23 edges: $K_{4,6}$ has degrees: 4 vertices degree 6, 6 vertices degree 4. Remove one edge ⇒ two vertices drop degree by 1: one from degree-6 side becomes 5, one from degree-4 side becomes 3. So max degree becomes 5 (since others still have degree 6? No — we removed only one edge, so three of the degree-6 vertices still have degree 6). Wait: $K_{4,6}$ has part A size 4, part B size 6. All edges between. So each vertex in A has degree 6, each in B has degree 4.\n\nRemove one edge between $a_i$ and $b_j$: then $a_i$ degree becomes 5, $b_j$ becomes 3; others unchanged. So max degree is still 6 (from other $a_k$). So to get max degree ≤ 5, we must remove *at least one edge incident to each of the 4 high-degree vertices*. But we only remove one edge → impossible. So no subgraph of $K_{4,6}$ with 23 edges has $\\Delta \\le 5$. Thus, only subgraphs of $K_{5,5}$ qualify.\n\nTherefore, $N_{\\Delta=5}$ equals the number of 23-edge subgraphs of some $K_{5,5}$, but with no double-counting: a given graph might be a subgraph of multiple $K_{5,5}$'s? Unlikely — if a graph has max degree 5 and 23 edges, and is bipartite with bipartition (5,5), it may be embeddable only in that partition.\n\nBut to avoid overcount, standard approach: count all bipartite graphs with a fixed balanced bipartition, then multiply by number of balanced bipartitions, assuming no overlap.\n\nNumber of ways to choose a 5–5 partition: $\\binom{10}{5} = 252$. Each defines a complete bipartite graph $K_{5,5}$ with 25 edges. Number of 23-edge subgraphs per partition: $\\binom{25}{23} = 300$. So total = $252 \\times 300 = 75600$.\n\nBut is there any graph counted multiple times? That is, can a 23-edge triangle-free graph with $\\Delta = 5$ be bipartite with respect to two different 5–5 partitions?\n\nSuppose a graph G is bipartite with partitions $A,B$ and also $A',B'$, both size 5. Then the bipartitions must be compatible. For connected bipartite graphs, the bipartition is unique. If G is disconnected, possibly not — but with 23 edges on 10 vertices, it's likely connected (minimum edges for disconnected is, say, isolated vertex + rest: but 23 edges is too many for that). Actually, maximum edges in disconnected graph: e.g., $K_9$ has $\\binom{9}{2}=36$, too big, but triangle-free disconnected: say $K_{5,5}$ minus edges is still connected usually. Anyway, assume uniqueness for now.\n\nSo $N_{\\Delta=5} = 75600$.\n\nThen $m = 75600 - 37798 = 37802$.\n\nWait: 75600 − 37798 = ?\n\nCompute: 75600 − 37798 = (75600 − 37600) − 198 = 38000 − 198 = 37802.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is this correct? Let's verify if there are other triangle-free, 23-edge, $\\Delta = 5$ graphs *not* contained in any $K_{5,5}$. For example, unbalanced bipartite graphs with max degree 5.\n\nSay partition (3,7): max edges = 21 < 23 → impossible.\n\n(4,6): max 24, but as shown, degrees on size-4 side are up to 6, so to get max degree 5, we must ensure no vertex on size-4 side has degree > 5. Since max possible is 6, we need to remove at least one edge incident to each of the 4 vertices? No — just ensure each has degree ≤ 5. Since each can connect to up to 6 vertices in other part, to limit degree to 5, for each of the 4, we must omit at least one edge from it. So minimum edges removed = 4 (one per vertex), but we only need to go from 24 to 23, i.e., remove 1 edge. So impossible to cap all degrees at 5 by removing only one edge. So no (4,6)-bipartite graph with 23 edges has $\\Delta \\le 5$.\n\nSimilarly, non-bipartite triangle-free graphs with 23 edges and $\\Delta = 5$: unlikely, as they'd require odd cycles, but adding chords to odd cycles creates triangles. It's very constrained.\n\nThus, likely $N_{\\Delta=5} = 75600$, so $m = 75600 - 37798 = 37802$.\n\nHold on — but the problem says \"maximum degree is *exactly* 5\", not \"at most 5\". In our count, all these graphs have max degree *exactly* 5 (since original $K_{5,5}$ has all degrees 5, and removing edges only lowers some degrees, but at least 6 vertices remain degree 5, so max is still 5). So yes.\n\nThus answer to Problem 1 is **37802**.\n\nBut let me double-check arithmetic:\n\n252 × 300 = 252 × 3 × 100 = 756 × 100 = 75600. Yes.\n\n75600 − 37798:\n\n75600  \n−37798  \n= ?\n\n75600 − 37000 = 38600  \n38600 − 798 = 37802. Yes.\n\nSo answer 1 = 37802.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**:  \nSuppose $f(x)$ is a rational function such that  \n$$\n3f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + \\frac{2f(x)}{x} = x^{2} \\quad \\text{for } x \\neq 0.\n$$  \nFind $f(-2)$.\n\nWe are given a functional equation involving $f(x)$ and $f(1/x)$. Standard technique: write the equation for $x$ and for $1/x$, then solve the system.\n\nLet’s denote the given equation as (1):\n\n(1) $3f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + \\frac{2}{x} f(x) = x^2$\n\nNow replace $x$ with $\\frac{1}{x}$ (valid since $x \\ne 0$):\n\nThen $\\frac{1}{x} \\to x$, so:\n\n$3f\\left(\\frac{1}{1/x}\\right) + \\frac{2}{1/x} f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$\\frac{1}{1/x} = x$, and $\\frac{2}{1/x} = 2x$, and RHS = $1/x^2$.\n\nSo:\n\n(2) $3f(x) + 2x f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$\n\nNow we have system:\n\n(1) $3f(1/x) + \\frac{2}{x} f(x) = x^2$  \n(2) $2x f(1/x) + 3f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$\n\nLet $a = f(x)$, $b = f(1/x)$. Then:\n\n(1) $3b + \\frac{2}{x} a = x^2$  \n(2) $2x b + 3a = \\frac{1}{x^2}$\n\nSolve for $a$.\n\nMultiply equation (1) by $x$ to eliminate denominator:\n\n$x \\cdot (3b + \\frac{2}{x} a) = x \\cdot x^2 \\Rightarrow 3x b + 2a = x^3$ → call this (1')\n\nEquation (2): $2x b + 3a = x^{-2}$ → (2)\n\nNow we have:\n\n(1') $3x b + 2a = x^3$  \n(2) $2x b + 3a = x^{-2}$\n\nLet’s eliminate $b$. Multiply (1') by 2: $6x b + 4a = 2x^3$  \nMultiply (2) by 3: $6x b + 9a = 3x^{-2}$\n\nSubtract: (6xb + 9a) − (6xb + 4a) = 3x^{-2} − 2x^3 ⇒ 5a = 3x^{-2} − 2x^3\n\nThus:\n\n$a = f(x) = \\frac{3}{5x^2} - \\frac{2}{5}x^3$\n\nCheck if this is rational: yes, ratio of polynomials.\n\nNow compute $f(-2)$:\n\n$f(-2) = \\frac{3}{5(-2)^2} - \\frac{2}{5}(-2)^3 = \\frac{3}{5 \\cdot 4} - \\frac{2}{5}(-8) = \\frac{3}{20} + \\frac{16}{5}$\n\nCompute: $\\frac{16}{5} = \\frac{64}{20}$, so $\\frac{3}{20} + \\frac{64}{20} = \\frac{67}{20}$\n\nSo $f(-2) = \\frac{67}{20}$\n\nLet’s verify the solution satisfies original equation.\n\nLet $f(x) = \\frac{3}{5x^2} - \\frac{2}{5}x^3$\n\nThen $f(1/x) = \\frac{3}{5(1/x)^2} - \\frac{2}{5}(1/x)^3 = \\frac{3}{5} x^2 - \\frac{2}{5} x^{-3}$\n\nNow compute LHS of (1): $3f(1/x) + \\frac{2}{x} f(x)$\n\nFirst term: $3f(1/x) = 3\\left( \\frac{3}{5} x^2 - \\frac{2}{5} x^{-3} \\right) = \\frac{9}{5} x^2 - \\frac{6}{5} x^{-3}$\n\nSecond term: $\\frac{2}{x} f(x) = \\frac{2}{x} \\left( \\frac{3}{5x^2} - \\frac{2}{5}x^3 \\right) = \\frac{6}{5x^3} - \\frac{4}{5} x^2$\n\nAdd:\n\n$\\frac{9}{5}x^2 - \\frac{4}{5}x^2 = \\frac{5}{5}x^2 = x^2$\n\nAnd $-\\frac{6}{5}x^{-3} + \\frac{6}{5}x^{-3} = 0$\n\nSo total = $x^2$. Correct.\n\nThus $f(-2) = \\frac{67}{20}$\n\nAs decimal: 3.35, but answer should be exact fraction.\n\nSo answer 2 = \"67/20\"\n\nBut check format: the problem says \"put ONLY the answer value in the quotes\", and for rational numbers, likely as reduced fraction string.\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers:\n\n- Problem 1: 37802  \n- Problem 2: \"67/20\"\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Triangle-free graphs on 10 labeled vertices with exactly 23 edges and maximum degree exactly 5 must be subgraphs of K_{5,5}, since other bipartitions yield maximum degree > 5 and non-bipartite graphs with 23 edges are unlikely to be triangle-free with max degree 5.
