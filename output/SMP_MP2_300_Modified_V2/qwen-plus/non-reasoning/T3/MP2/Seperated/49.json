  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> How many ways, without taking order into consideration, can 2002 be expressed as the sum of 3 positive integers (for instance, $1000+1000+2$ and $1000+2+1000$ are considered to be the same way)? Instead of determining the total number of unordered triples of positive integers that sum to the given total, simply find $e = l + 2012$, where $l$ is the terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends.\n\nSo we’re not asked for the total number of unordered triples — just a derived quantity: $e = l + 2012$, where $l$ is the *terminal term* of the *shorter arithmetic sequence* that arises when analyzing possible *middle addends* in the enumeration of unordered triples $(a,b,c)$ with $a \\le b \\le c$, $a+b+c = 2002$, $a,b,c \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$.\n\nLet’s understand the standard approach to counting unordered triples of positive integers summing to $N = 2002$.\n\nWe want number of integer solutions to:\n\n$$\na + b + c = 2002,\\quad \\text{with } 1 \\le a \\le b \\le c.\n$$\n\nStandard method: Let’s define variables to enforce ordering.\n\nLet:\n- $a = x$\n- $b = x + y$, where $y \\ge 0$\n- $c = x + y + z$, where $z \\ge 0$\n\nThen:\n$$\na + b + c = x + (x+y) + (x+y+z) = 3x + 2y + z = 2002,\n$$\nwith $x \\ge 1$, $y \\ge 0$, $z \\ge 0$.\n\nBut perhaps more common is to use transformation to nonnegative integers via $a' = a-1$, etc., but here ordering matters.\n\nAlternative standard method: For unordered triples of positive integers summing to $N$, the count equals the number of integer partitions of $N$ into exactly 3 positive parts.\n\nThe number of partitions of $N$ into exactly 3 positive parts is known to be:\n\n$$\np_3(N) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{N^2}{12} \\right\\rfloor \\quad \\text{if } N \\text{ is odd}, \\quad \\left\\lfloor \\frac{N^2 + 3}{12} \\right\\rfloor \\quad \\text{if } N \\text{ is even}.\n$$\n\nBut again, problem says *don’t compute total*, instead do case analysis on middle addend.\n\nLet’s let the three numbers be $a \\le b \\le c$, all $\\ge 1$, sum = 2002.\n\nThen $b$ is the middle term. Since $a \\le b \\le c$, and $a + c = 2002 - b$, and also $a \\le b$, $c \\ge b$, so:\n\n- From $a \\le b$ and $a = 2002 - b - c$, but better: since $a \\le b \\le c$, then:\n\nMinimum $a$ is 1, maximum $a$ is $b$ (since $a \\le b$), and $c = 2002 - a - b \\ge b \\implies 2002 - a - b \\ge b \\implies a \\le 2002 - 2b$.\n\nAlso $a \\ge 1$, so for fixed $b$, valid $a$ satisfy:\n\n$$\n1 \\le a \\le \\min(b,\\; 2002 - 2b)\n$$\n\nAlso need RHS ≥ LHS, i.e., $\\min(b, 2002 - 2b) \\ge 1$, so both $b \\ge 1$ and $2002 - 2b \\ge 1 \\implies b \\le 1000.5 \\implies b \\le 1000$.\n\nAlso since $a \\le b$ and $c \\ge b$, and $a + b + c = 2002$, the smallest possible $b$ occurs when numbers are as equal as possible? Let's find range of possible $b$.\n\nSince $a \\le b \\le c$, then $b$ is at least the ceiling of average: average is $2002/3 = 667.\\overline{3}$, so $b \\ge 668$? Wait no: consider $a=1, b=1, c=2000$: then $b = 1$. So $b$ can be small. But constraint $c \\ge b$ gives $2002 - a - b \\ge b \\implies a \\le 2002 - 2b$. Since $a \\ge 1$, need $2002 - 2b \\ge 1 \\implies b \\le 1000$. So $b$ max is 1000.\n\nAlso $b$ must be at least such that there exists $a \\le b$ and $c = 2002 - a - b \\ge b$. To get minimal $b$, suppose $a = b$, then $c = 2002 - 2b \\ge b \\implies 2002 \\ge 3b \\implies b \\le \\lfloor 2002/3 \\rfloor = 667$. Wait, that’s upper bound for $b$ when $a = b$? No, that’s condition for $c \\ge b$ when $a = b$: then $c = 2002 - 2b \\ge b \\implies b \\le 667.\\overline{3} \\implies b \\le 667$. But earlier we had $b \\le 1000$ from $a \\ge 1$. So which is tighter?\n\nLet’s carefully derive bounds on $b$.\n\nGiven $a \\le b \\le c$, all ≥ 1, sum = 2002.\n\nFrom $b \\le c = 2002 - a - b \\implies a \\le 2002 - 2b$.\n\nAlso $a \\ge 1$, so $1 \\le a \\le \\min(b, 2002 - 2b)$.\n\nSo for this interval to be nonempty: need $\\min(b, 2002 - 2b) \\ge 1$.\n\nSo both $b \\ge 1$ and $2002 - 2b \\ge 1 \\implies b \\le 1000$.\n\nBut also need $\\min(b, 2002 - 2b) \\ge 1$, and for there to exist integer $a$, need lower bound ≤ upper bound: $1 \\le \\min(b, 2002 - 2b)$, which holds as long as $b \\ge 1$ and $b \\le 1000$.\n\nHowever, for a given $b$, number of $a$ is:\n\n$$\n\\#a = \\max\\left(0,\\; \\min(b, 2002 - 2b) - 1 + 1\\right) = \\min(b, 2002 - 2b)\n$$\n\nWait: number of integers $a$ with $1 \\le a \\le M$ is $M$, if $M \\ge 1$, else 0. So yes, for each $b$, number of valid $a$ is $\\min(b, 2002 - 2b)$, provided that is ≥ 1.\n\nSo the count of triples is:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{b=1}^{1000} \\min(b, 2002 - 2b)\n$$\n\nBut this sum splits at point where $b = 2002 - 2b \\implies 3b = 2002 \\implies b = 2002/3 \\approx 667.333...$\n\nSo for $b \\le 667$, $b \\le 2002 - 2b$, so $\\min = b$\n\nFor $b \\ge 668$, $2002 - 2b < b$, so $\\min = 2002 - 2b$\n\nCheck: at $b = 667$: $2002 - 2*667 = 2002 - 1334 = 668$, so $b = 667 < 668$, so min = b.\n\nAt $b = 668$: $2002 - 1336 = 666 < 668$, so min = 666.\n\nSo the switch happens between $b = 667$ and $b = 668$.\n\nThus:\n\n- For $b = 1$ to $667$: term = $b$\n- For $b = 668$ to $1000$: term = $2002 - 2b$\n\nNow, how many terms in each part?\n\nFirst part: $b = 1$ to $667$: 667 terms, arithmetic sequence $1,2,...,667$, sum = $\\frac{667 \\cdot 668}{2}$\n\nSecond part: $b = 668$ to $1000$: number of terms = $1000 - 668 + 1 = 333$\n\nSequence of terms: when $b = 668$, term = $2002 - 2*668 = 2002 - 1336 = 666$\n\n$b = 669$: $2002 - 1338 = 664$\n\nSo it's decreasing by 2 each time: $666, 664, 662, ..., ?$\n\nLast term: $b = 1000$: $2002 - 2000 = 2$\n\nSo sequence: starts at 666, ends at 2, step -2 → arithmetic sequence with first term $l_1 = 666$, last term $l = 2$, common difference $d = -2$, number of terms $n = \\frac{666 - 2}{2} + 1 = \\frac{664}{2} + 1 = 332 + 1 = 333$. Yes matches.\n\nSo second part is arithmetic sequence: $666, 664, ..., 2$, which has 333 terms, first term 666, last term 2.\n\nThe problem says: “find $e = l + 2012$, where $l$ is the terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends.”\n\nWe have two arithmetic sequences:\n\n- First: $b = 1$ to $667$: terms $1,2,...,667$ → length 667, terminal term = 667\n\n- Second: $b = 668$ to $1000$: terms $666, 664, ..., 2$ → length 333, terminal term = 2\n\nWhich is shorter? 333 < 667, so shorter sequence is the second one, with terminal term $l = 2$\n\nThus $e = l + 2012 = 2 + 2012 = 2014$\n\nWait — but let’s double-check: is the \"shorter arithmetic sequence\" referring to the sequence of *terms* (i.e., the values of $\\min(b, 2002-2b)$) or the sequence of $b$'s? The problem says: “the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends”.\n\nMiddle addends are the $b$'s. In case analysis, we split $b$ into two ranges: $b = 1$ to $667$, and $b = 668$ to $1000$. These are two arithmetic sequences of $b$ values:\n\n- First: $b = 1,2,3,...,667$: arithmetic sequence with difference 1, length 667, terminal term 667\n\n- Second: $b = 668,669,...,1000$: arithmetic sequence with difference 1, length 333, terminal term 1000\n\nThen “shorter arithmetic sequence” would be the $b$-range with fewer terms: second one, length 333, terminal term $l = 1000$\n\nThen $e = 1000 + 2012 = 3012$\n\nBut the problem says “the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends”. The middle addends are $b$, and we partitioned the domain of $b$ into two intervals, each forming an arithmetic sequence (consecutive integers). So yes, the $b$-sequences are arithmetic.\n\nLengths: first is $b = 1$ to $667$: 667 terms  \nSecond is $b = 668$ to $1000$: $1000 - 668 + 1 = 333$ terms.\n\nSo shorter is second, terminal term $l = 1000$, so $e = 1000 + 2012 = 3012$\n\nBut wait — is $b = 1$ to $667$ valid? Let's verify feasibility.\n\nRecall $a \\le b \\le c$, $a \\ge 1$, $c = 2002 - a - b \\ge b \\implies a \\le 2002 - 2b$\n\nFor $b = 1$: need $a \\le 2002 - 2 = 2000$, and $a \\le b = 1$, so $a = 1$, then $c = 2002 - 1 - 1 = 2000$, and $1 \\le 1 \\le 2000$: OK.\n\nFor $b = 667$: $a \\le \\min(667, 2002 - 1334 = 668) = 667$, and $a \\ge 1$, so $a = 1$ to $667$. Then $c = 2002 - a - 667 = 1335 - a$. Since $a \\le 667$, $c \\ge 1335 - 667 = 668 \\ge b = 667$: OK.\n\nFor $b = 668$: $a \\le \\min(668, 2002 - 1336 = 666) = 666$, and $a \\ge 1$, so $a = 1$ to $666$, $c = 2002 - a - 668 = 1334 - a \\ge 1334 - 666 = 668 = b$: OK.\n\nFor $b = 1000$: $a \\le \\min(1000, 2002 - 2000 = 2) = 2$, so $a = 1$ or $2$. Then $c = 2002 - a - 1000 = 1002 - a$, so if $a = 1$, $c = 1001 \\ge 1000$; if $a = 2$, $c = 1000$, OK.\n\nSo $b$ ranges from 1 to 1000 inclusive.\n\nThus the two $b$-intervals are:\n\n- $b = 1,2,\\dots,667$: length 667\n\n- $b = 668,669,\\dots,1000$: length 333\n\nSo shorter is second, terminal term $l = 1000$\n\nHence $e = 1000 + 2012 = 3012$\n\nBut wait — the problem says “the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends”. Is there another interpretation?\n\nPerhaps “case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends” refers to enumerating possible values of $b$, and in each case, the number of $a$ forms an arithmetic sequence? Earlier we saw for $b = 1$ to $667$, number of $a$ is $b$: so sequence $1,2,3,...,667$: arithmetic, length 667, terminal 667\n\nFor $b = 668$ to $1000$, number of $a$ is $2002 - 2b$: sequence $666,664,...,2$: arithmetic, length 333, terminal 2\n\nNow which is shorter? 333 < 667, so shorter is second, terminal term $l = 2$, so $e = 2 + 2012 = 2014$\n\nThe phrase is ambiguous, but note: it says “the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends”.\n\nThe case analysis is splitting based on $b$, and in each case, the *count* of solutions (i.e., number of $a$) forms an arithmetic sequence. That seems more likely — because the “enumerating” refers to counting how many ways for each $b$, i.e., the number of $a$'s.\n\nMoreover, the problem mentions “the terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence”, and in the second case, the sequence of counts is $666, 664, ..., 2$, which is arithmetic with difference $-2$, and terminal (i.e., last) term is 2.\n\nWhereas the $b$-sequences are trivial arithmetic sequences with difference 1 — less interesting.\n\nAlso, the problem says “arising in the case analysis for enumerating”, and enumeration typically refers to counting, i.e., the number of options.\n\nFurthermore, in many combinatorial derivations, when you split into cases, the *number of solutions per case* forms arithmetic sequences.\n\nSo likely $l = 2$, $e = 2014$\n\nBut let’s see if 2014 makes sense. Or maybe they mean the sequence of $c$ or something else.\n\nAlternative approach: Let’s denote the three numbers as $x \\le y \\le z$, sum $x+y+z = 2002$\n\nLet $y$ be the middle term. For fixed $y$, what are possible $x$? As before, $x \\le y$ and $z = 2002 - x - y \\ge y \\implies x \\le 2002 - 2y$, and $x \\ge 1$, so $x$ ranges from 1 to $\\min(y, 2002 - 2y)$\n\nSo number of $x$ is $\\min(y, 2002 - 2y)$, as before.\n\nSo the sequence of counts vs $y$ is:\n\n- For $y = 1$ to $667$: count = $y$ → arithmetic sequence $1,2,...,667$, length 667, last term 667\n\n- For $y = 668$ to $1000$: count = $2002 - 2y$ → arithmetic sequence $666,664,...,2$, length 333, last term 2\n\nSo two arithmetic sequences of counts. Shorter is second, length 333, terminal term 2.\n\nHence $l = 2$, $e = 2 + 2012 = 2014$\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nSo answer to Problem 1 is **2014**\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer with exactly 2015 positive factors. What is the sum of the (not necessarily distinct) prime factors of $n$?\n\nRecall: If $n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_k^{a_k}$, then number of positive divisors is $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\\dots(a_k + 1)$\n\nWe need this product to be 2015.\n\nFactor 2015:\n\n2015 ÷ 5 = 403  \n403 = 13 × 31  \nSo $2015 = 5 \\times 13 \\times 31$\n\nAll prime.\n\nSo the divisor function value is product of integers > 1, each being $a_i + 1$\n\nTo minimize $n$, we assign larger exponents to smaller primes (since $p^a$ grows slower for smaller $p$), and sort exponents in decreasing order.\n\nSo factorization of 2015 into integers > 1: possibilities:\n\n- Three factors: $5 \\times 13 \\times 31$\n\n- Two factors: $5 \\times 403$, $13 \\times 155$, $31 \\times 65$\n\n- One factor: $2015$ → exponent $2014$, so $n = 2^{2014}$, huge.\n\nWe want smallest $n$, so prefer more small prime bases with moderate exponents.\n\nStandard strategy: write $2015 = \\prod (e_i)$ where $e_i = a_i + 1$, then exponents $a_i = e_i - 1$, assign largest $a_i$ to smallest prime.\n\nSo list possible exponent configurations (multisets of $a_i$):\n\nSince $2015 = 5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 31$, all prime, the possible ways to write as product of integers > 1:\n\n1. Single factor: $2015$ → exponents: $[2014]$ → $n = 2^{2014}$\n\n2. Two factors: factor pairs of 2015:\n\n- $5 \\times 403$: then exponents $4$ and $402$ → assign $402$ to prime 2, $4$ to prime 3: $n = 2^{402} \\cdot 3^4$\n\n- $13 \\times 155$: $12$ and $154$: $2^{154} \\cdot 3^{12}$\n\n- $31 \\times 65$: $30$ and $64$: $2^{64} \\cdot 3^{30}$\n\n3. Three factors: $5 \\times 13 \\times 31$: exponents $4,12,30$ → assign largest exponent to smallest prime: so $2^{30} \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 5^{4}$\n\nAlso permutations, but to minimize $n$, sort exponents descending and assign to ascending primes.\n\nSo candidate exponents: $30,12,4$ → $n = 2^{30} \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 5^{4}$\n\nCompare size with two-factor options.\n\nIs $2^{64} \\cdot 3^{30}$ smaller than $2^{30} \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 5^{4}$?\n\nTake logs:\n\n- $\\log n_1 = 30 \\log 2 + 12 \\log 3 + 4 \\log 5$\n\n- $\\log n_2 = 64 \\log 2 + 30 \\log 3$\n\nCompute approximate values:\n\n$\\log_{10} 2 \\approx 0.3010$, $\\log_{10} 3 \\approx 0.4771$, $\\log_{10} 5 \\approx 0.6990$\n\nThen:\n\n$n_1$: $30*0.3010 = 9.03$, $12*0.4771 = 5.7252$, $4*0.6990 = 2.796$ → sum ≈ 17.5512\n\n$n_2$: $64*0.3010 = 19.264$, $30*0.4771 = 14.313$ → sum ≈ 33.577 → much larger.\n\nSimilarly, $2^{402} \\cdot 3^4$ is enormous.\n\nWhat about other three-factor combinations? But 2015 has only three prime factors, so only one way to write as product of three integers > 1, up to order: $5\\times13\\times31$\n\nCould we use more than three factors by including 1? No, since $a_i + 1 \\ge 2$, so all factors must be ≥ 2.\n\nCould we use four factors? Only if we break a factor into smaller ones, but 2015 is squarefree with three primes, so any factorization into ≥4 factors would require using 1, which is invalid (since $a_i + 1 \\ge 2$). So maximum number of factors in the product is 3.\n\nThus the minimal $n$ corresponds to exponents $30,12,4$ assigned to primes $2,3,5$ respectively.\n\nSo $n = 2^{30} \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 5^{4}$\n\nNow, “sum of the (not necessarily distinct) prime factors of $n$”\n\nThis means sum of prime factors *with multiplicity*, i.e., the sum of all primes in the prime factorization, counting repeats.\n\nSo $n = 2^{30} \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 5^{4}$ has:\n\n- thirty 2's\n\n- twelve 3's\n\n- four 5's\n\nSo sum = $30 \\times 2 + 12 \\times 3 + 4 \\times 5 = 60 + 36 + 20 = 116$\n\nBut wait — is this what “sum of the (not necessarily distinct) prime factors” means?\n\nYes, standard interpretation: e.g., for $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$, sum of prime factors with multiplicity is $2+2+3 = 7$\n\nSometimes called “integer logarithm” or “sopfr”.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThus answer is 116.\n\nBut let’s confirm $n$ is indeed minimal.\n\nCould we assign exponents differently? Say $2^{30} \\cdot 3^{4} \\cdot 5^{12}$? That would be larger since $5^{12} > 3^{12}$, and 5 > 3, so better to put larger exponent on smaller prime.\n\nOur assignment $2^{30} 3^{12} 5^4$ is optimal.\n\nIs there a way with more primes? For example, if we could write 2015 as product involving more terms, but since 2015 = 5×13×31, all prime, we cannot write as product of more than three integers all ≥2 without introducing 1, which is invalid.\n\nUnless we use exponents like $a_i + 1 = 2015$, but that’s one prime.\n\nOr $a_i + 1 = 5 \\times 13 = 65$, $a_j + 1 = 31$, so two primes: exponents 64 and 30 → $2^{64} 3^{30}$, which we saw is larger.\n\nSo yes, three primes is best.\n\nThus sum is $30\\cdot2 + 12\\cdot3 + 4\\cdot5 = 60 + 36 + 20 = 116$\n\nAnswer to Problem 2 is **116**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To count unordered triples of positive integers summing to 2002, we fix the middle term b and find the number of valid smallest terms a. This leads to two cases: for b from 1 to 667, the count of a is b (forming arithmetic sequence 1,2,...,667); for b from 668 to 1000, the count is 2002-2b (forming arithmetic sequence 666,664,...,2). The shorter sequence is the latter with 333 terms and terminal term 2, so e = 2 + 2012 = 2014. Problem 2: The number of divisors is 2015 = 5×13×31. To minimize n, assign exponents 30,12,4 to the smallest primes 2,3,5 respectively, giving n = 2^30 × 3^12 × 5^4.
