  "reasoning_content": "Let's solve each problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 1:**\n\nWe are told:\n\n- A tightrope walker stands in the center of a rope of length 32 meters → so the rope extends 16 meters forward and 16 meters backward from her starting position.\n- So positions can be modeled as integers from −16 to +16, with start at 0.\n- Each minute, she moves +1 (forward) with probability $ p = \\frac{3}{4} $, and −1 (backward) with probability $ q = \\frac{1}{4} $.\n- We are asked: *What is the probability that she reaches the end in front of her before the end behind her?*  \nBut then it says: *\"Instead of computing the probability... simply find $ k = r + \\frac{2}{3} $, where $ r $ is the ratio of the backward probability to the forward probability.\"*\n\nSo we don’t need to compute the actual absorption probability — just compute $ r = \\frac{q}{p} = \\frac{1/4}{3/4} = \\frac{1}{3} $.  \nThen $ k = r + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = 1 $.\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **1**.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\nSam walks on a $2 \\times 2$ grid of squares. Let’s assume the labeling is:\n\n```\n1 2\n3 4\n```\n\nThat is standard row-major labeling for a 2×2 grid: top-left = 1, top-right = 2, bottom-left = 3, bottom-right = 4.\n\nAdjacency: squares sharing a side → so:\n- 1 is adjacent to 2 (right) and 3 (down)\n- 2 is adjacent to 1 (left) and 4 (down)\n- 3 is adjacent to 1 (up) and 4 (right)\n- 4 is adjacent to 2 (up) and 3 (left)\n\nSo adjacency graph is a cycle of length 4: 1–2–4–3–1 (a square). No diagonals.\n\nHe starts at square 1. Every second he moves to an adjacent square. We want number of paths such that the **sum of the numbers on every square he visits *in his path* is equal to 20**, *not counting the square he started on*.\n\nImportant: “Not counting the square he started on” → So the sum includes only the squares visited *after* the start — i.e., the squares he steps on during moves, not the initial square 1.\n\nAlso, “paths” — presumably finite sequences of moves (each move goes to adjacent square), and the sum of labels of all visited squares *except the first* equals 20.\n\nWe need to count all such finite paths (of any length ≥ 1) where the sum of labels of all positions *after the start* equals 20.\n\nLet’s formalize:\n\n- A path is a sequence $ s_0, s_1, s_2, ..., s_n $, where $ s_0 = 1 $, and for each $ i \\ge 1 $, $ s_i $ is adjacent to $ s_{i-1} $, and all $ s_i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\} $.\n\n- Sum condition: $ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i = 20 $.\n\n- We count all such finite paths (any $ n \\ge 1 $) satisfying this.\n\nNote: The same square can be visited multiple times — no restriction against revisiting.\n\nSo this is like counting walks on the graph (4-node cycle) starting at node 1, where the sum of node labels along the walk (excluding start) equals 20.\n\nEach node has label equal to its number: 1→1, 2→2, 3→3, 4→4.\n\nSo we’re counting walks starting at 1, of length $ n \\ge 1 $, where the sum of the $ n $ visited nodes (i.e., $ s_1 $ through $ s_n $) is exactly 20.\n\nSince node values are small (1–4), and sum needed is 20, the minimal number of steps is when all steps are to square 4: $ \\lceil 20/4 \\rceil = 5 $. Max steps is if all steps are to square 1: 20 steps.\n\nSo $ n $ ranges from 5 to 20.\n\nWe need to count number of walks of length $ n $ on the 4-cycle graph (nodes 1–2–4–3–1), starting at 1, such that sum of node labels visited at steps 1..n equals 20.\n\nThis is a classic dynamic programming / generating function problem.\n\nLet’s define $ f(n, s, v) $ = number of walks of length $ n $, ending at node $ v \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\} $, with total sum of visited nodes (i.e., the $ n $ labels) equal to $ s $.\n\nWe want $ \\sum_{v=1}^4 f(n, 20, v) $ over all $ n $, but since sum is fixed at 20, and each step contributes at least 1, $ n \\le 20 $, and we can compute up to $ n = 20 $.\n\nBut doing this manually is tedious — maybe there's symmetry or generating function insight.\n\nLet’s list adjacency again clearly:\n\n- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3}\n- Node 2: neighbors {1, 4}\n- Node 3: neighbors {1, 4}\n- Node 4: neighbors {2, 3}\n\nSo it's an undirected graph: edges are (1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4). So it's a *diamond* graph — actually, it's the complete graph $ K_4 $ minus two opposite edges? Wait no: 1 connected to 2 and 3; 2 connected to 1 and 4; 3 connected to 1 and 4; 4 connected to 2 and 3. So yes — it's a 4-cycle: 1-2-4-3-1. Yes, same as before.\n\nSo structure is a cycle of even length — symmetric.\n\nLet’s assign variables:\n\nLet’s define DP state: $ dp[s][v] $ = number of ways to achieve sum $ s $ ending at node $ v $, where $ v \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\} $, and the sum includes only the nodes visited *after start*, i.e., the first step lands on some neighbor of 1, and contributes its label.\n\nInitial step: from 1, can go to 2 or 3. So:\n\n- After 1 step: sum = label of destination = 2 or 3 → so dp[2][2] = 1, dp[3][3] = 1.\n\nThen recursively, for each sum s, and each node v, dp[s][v] contributes to dp[s + w][u] for each neighbor u of v, where w = label of u.\n\nSo transitions:\n\n- From node 1: can go to 2 (label 2) or 3 (label 3)\n- From node 2: can go to 1 (label 1) or 4 (label 4)\n- From node 3: can go to 1 (label 1) or 4 (label 4)\n- From node 4: can go to 2 (label 2) or 3 (label 3)\n\nSo transition map:\n\n- To reach sum s at node 1: must have come from node 2 or 3 at sum s−1 (since label of 1 is 1)\n- To reach sum s at node 2: must have come from node 1 or 4 at sum s−2 (since label of 2 is 2)\n- To reach sum s at node 3: must have come from node 1 or 4 at sum s−3 (label 3)\n- To reach sum s at node 4: must have come from node 2 or 3 at sum s−4 (label 4)\n\nSo recurrence:\n\n- $ dp[s][1] = dp[s-1][2] + dp[s-1][3] $\n- $ dp[s][2] = dp[s-2][1] + dp[s-2][4] $\n- $ dp[s][3] = dp[s-3][1] + dp[s-3][4] $\n- $ dp[s][4] = dp[s-4][2] + dp[s-4][3] $\n\nBase cases: only possible after at least one move.\n\nInitialize for s = 0: no moves → but problem says \"not counting start\", and path must include at least one move (to have sum), so s ≥ 1.\n\nFrom start at 1:\n\n- Step 1: to 2 → sum = 2 → dp[2][2] = 1\n- Step 1: to 3 → sum = 3 → dp[3][3] = 1\n\nAll other dp[s][v] = 0 for s < label(v), or inconsistent.\n\nSo:\n\n- dp[1][*] = 0 (can't get sum 1 in one step: min label reachable in one step is 2 or 3)\n- dp[2][2] = 1; others at s=2: dp[2][1]=dp[2][3]=dp[2][4]=0\n- dp[3][3] = 1; others at s=3: 0\n- dp[4][?]: possible ways to get sum 4:\n    - Two steps: e.g., 1→2→1: sum = 2 + 1 = 3 → no\n    - 1→2→4: sum = 2 + 4 = 6\n    - 1→3→1: 3 + 1 = 4 → yes! So path: 1→3→1 → sum = 3 (first step) + 1 (second step) = 4, ends at 1 → so dp[4][1] += 1\n    - Also 1→2→1: sum = 2 + 1 = 3 → already counted\n    - 1→3→4: 3 + 4 = 7\n    - One step to 4? Not possible — 1 not adjacent to 4.\n    - So only way to get sum 4 in two steps is 1→3→1 or 1→2→1? 1→2→1 gives sum 2+1 = 3. 1→3→1 gives 3+1 = 4. Also 1→2→? other than 1: 2→4 → sum 2+4 = 6. So only 1→3→1 gives sum 4 → dp[4][1] = 1.\n\nLet’s instead write a small table up to s = 20 using recurrence. Since it's only up to 20, and 4 states, we can simulate.\n\nWe’ll compute dp[s][v] for s from 1 to 20.\n\nInitialize all dp[s][v] = 0.\n\nSet base:\n\n- dp[2][2] = 1   (1→2)\n- dp[3][3] = 1   (1→3)\n\nNow iterate s from 1 to 20.\n\nBut recurrences require smaller s, so compute in increasing s.\n\nLet’s make a table.\n\nWe'll denote dp[s] = [a,b,c,d] where a = dp[s][1], b = dp[s][2], c = dp[s][3], d = dp[s][4]\n\nInitialize all zeros.\n\nSet:\n- s=2: [0,1,0,0]\n- s=3: [0,0,1,0]\n\nNow compute s=4:\n\n- dp[4][1] = dp[3][2] + dp[3][3] = 0 + 1 = 1\n- dp[4][2] = dp[2][1] + dp[2][4] = 0 + 0 = 0\n- dp[4][3] = dp[1][1] + dp[1][4] → s−3 = 1, dp[1][*] = 0 → 0\n- dp[4][4] = dp[0][2] + dp[0][3] → s−4 = 0, undefined; assume dp[0][v] = 0 for all v (no steps, no contribution), so 0\n\nSo dp[4] = [1, 0, 0, 0]\n\ns=5:\n\n- dp[5][1] = dp[4][2] + dp[4][3] = 0 + 0 = 0\n- dp[5][2] = dp[3][1] + dp[3][4] = 0 + 0 = 0\n- dp[5][3] = dp[2][1] + dp[2][4] = 0 + 0 = 0\n- dp[5][4] = dp[1][2] + dp[1][3] = 0 + 0 = 0  \nSo dp[5] = [0,0,0,0]\n\ns=6:\n\n- dp[6][1] = dp[5][2] + dp[5][3] = 0 + 0 = 0\n- dp[6][2] = dp[4][1] + dp[4][4] = 1 + 0 = 1\n- dp[6][3] = dp[3][1] + dp[3][4] = 0 + 0 = 0\n- dp[6][4] = dp[2][2] + dp[2][3] = 1 + 0 = 1  \nSo dp[6] = [0,1,0,1]\n\ns=7:\n\n- dp[7][1] = dp[6][2] + dp[6][3] = 1 + 0 = 1\n- dp[7][2] = dp[5][1] + dp[5][4] = 0 + 0 = 0\n- dp[7][3] = dp[4][1] + dp[4][4] = 1 + 0 = 1\n- dp[7][4] = dp[3][2] + dp[3][3] = 0 + 1 = 1  \nSo dp[7] = [1,0,1,1]\n\ns=8:\n\n- dp[8][1] = dp[7][2] + dp[7][3] = 0 + 1 = 1\n- dp[8][2] = dp[6][1] + dp[6][4] = 0 + 1 = 1\n- dp[8][3] = dp[5][1] + dp[5][4] = 0 + 0 = 0\n- dp[8][4] = dp[4][2] + dp[4][3] = 1 + 0 = 1  \nSo dp[8] = [1,1,0,1]\n\ns=9:\n\n- dp[9][1] = dp[8][2] + dp[8][3] = 1 + 0 = 1\n- dp[9][2] = dp[7][1] + dp[7][4] = 1 + 1 = 2\n- dp[9][3] = dp[6][1] + dp[6][4] = 0 + 1 = 1\n- dp[9][4] = dp[5][2] + dp[5][3] = 0 + 0 = 0  \nSo dp[9] = [1,2,1,0]\n\ns=10:\n\n- dp[10][1] = dp[9][2] + dp[9][3] = 2 + 1 = 3\n- dp[10][2] = dp[8][1] + dp[8][4] = 1 + 1 = 2\n- dp[10][3] = dp[7][1] + dp[7][4] = 1 + 1 = 2\n- dp[10][4] = dp[6][2] + dp[6][3] = 1 + 0 = 1  \nSo dp[10] = [3,2,2,1]\n\ns=11:\n\n- dp[11][1] = dp[10][2] + dp[10][3] = 2 + 2 = 4\n- dp[11][2] = dp[9][1] + dp[9][4] = 1 + 0 = 1\n- dp[11][3] = dp[8][1] + dp[8][4] = 1 + 1 = 2\n- dp[11][4] = dp[7][2] + dp[7][3] = 0 + 1 = 1  \ndp[11] = [4,1,2,1]\n\ns=12:\n\n- dp[12][1] = dp[11][2] + dp[11][3] = 1 + 2 = 3\n- dp[12][2] = dp[10][1] + dp[10][4] = 3 + 1 = 4\n- dp[12][3] = dp[9][1] + dp[9][4] = 1 + 0 = 1\n- dp[12][4] = dp[8][2] + dp[8][3] = 1 + 0 = 1  \ndp[12] = [3,4,1,1]\n\ns=13:\n\n- dp[13][1] = dp[12][2] + dp[12][3] = 4 + 1 = 5\n- dp[13][2] = dp[11][1] + dp[11][4] = 4 + 1 = 5\n- dp[13][3] = dp[10][1] + dp[10][4] = 3 + 1 = 4\n- dp[13][4] = dp[9][2] + dp[9][3] = 2 + 1 = 3  \ndp[13] = [5,5,4,3]\n\ns=14:\n\n- dp[14][1] = dp[13][2] + dp[13][3] = 5 + 4 = 9\n- dp[14][2] = dp[12][1] + dp[12][4] = 3 + 1 = 4\n- dp[14][3] = dp[11][1] + dp[11][4] = 4 + 1 = 5\n- dp[14][4] = dp[10][2] + dp[10][3] = 2 + 2 = 4  \ndp[14] = [9,4,5,4]\n\ns=15:\n\n- dp[15][1] = dp[14][2] + dp[14][3] = 4 + 5 = 9\n- dp[15][2] = dp[13][1] + dp[13][4] = 5 + 3 = 8\n- dp[15][3] = dp[12][1] + dp[12][4] = 3 + 1 = 4\n- dp[15][4] = dp[11][2] + dp[11][3] = 1 + 2 = 3  \ndp[15] = [9,8,4,3]\n\ns=16:\n\n- dp[16][1] = dp[15][2] + dp[15][3] = 8 + 4 = 12\n- dp[16][2] = dp[14][1] + dp[14][4] = 9 + 4 = 13\n- dp[16][3] = dp[13][1] + dp[13][4] = 5 + 3 = 8\n- dp[16][4] = dp[12][2] + dp[12][3] = 4 + 1 = 5  \ndp[16] = [12,13,8,5]\n\ns=17:\n\n- dp[17][1] = dp[16][2] + dp[16][3] = 13 + 8 = 21\n- dp[17][2] = dp[15][1] + dp[15][4] = 9 + 3 = 12\n- dp[17][3] = dp[14][1] + dp[14][4] = 9 + 4 = 13\n- dp[17][4] = dp[13][2] + dp[13][3] = 5 + 4 = 9  \ndp[17] = [21,12,13,9]\n\ns=18:\n\n- dp[18][1] = dp[17][2] + dp[17][3] = 12 + 13 = 25\n- dp[18][2] = dp[16][1] + dp[16][4] = 12 + 5 = 17\n- dp[18][3] = dp[15][1] + dp[15][4] = 9 + 3 = 12\n- dp[18][4] = dp[14][2] + dp[14][3] = 4 + 5 = 9  \ndp[18] = [25,17,12,9]\n\ns=19:\n\n- dp[19][1] = dp[18][2] + dp[18][3] = 17 + 12 = 29\n- dp[19][2] = dp[17][1] + dp[17][4] = 21 + 9 = 30\n- dp[19][3] = dp[16][1] + dp[16][4] = 12 + 5 = 17\n- dp[19][4] = dp[15][2] + dp[15][3] = 8 + 4 = 12  \ndp[19] = [29,30,17,12]\n\ns=20:\n\n- dp[20][1] = dp[19][2] + dp[19][3] = 30 + 17 = 47\n- dp[20][2] = dp[18][1] + dp[18][4] = 25 + 9 = 34\n- dp[20][3] = dp[17][1] + dp[17][4] = 21 + 9 = 30\n- dp[20][4] = dp[16][2] + dp[16][3] = 13 + 8 = 21  \n\nSo dp[20] = [47, 34, 30, 21]\n\nTotal number of paths with sum 20 = sum over v = 47 + 34 + 30 + 21 = let's compute:\n\n47 + 34 = 81  \n30 + 21 = 51  \n81 + 51 = 132\n\nSo answer is 132.\n\nBut wait — is this correct? Let's sanity check with small sums.\n\nFor example, sum = 2: only path 1→2 → 1 way → dp[2][2] = 1 ✔  \nSum = 3: 1→3 → 1 way ✔  \nSum = 4: we found dp[4][1] = 1 → path 1→3→1 ✔  \nAre there others? 1→2→1→2? That would be sum 2+1+2 = 5, too big. So only one way for sum 4.\n\nSum = 6: dp[6] = [0,1,0,1] → total 2. What are they?\n\n- 1→2→4: sum 2+4 = 6 → ends at 4 ✔  \n- 1→3→4: sum 3+4 = 7 → no  \n- 1→2→1→2→1→2: too long  \nWait, 1→2→4 is one (sum 6). Another? 1→3→1→3→1→3? sum 3+1+3+1+3 = 11. No.\n\nHow to get sum 6 ending at 2? dp[6][2] = 1 → means last step was to 2, so previous sum was 6−2 = 4, and came from neighbor of 2, i.e., 1 or 4. So dp[4][1] = 1, dp[4][4] = 0 → so path: ...→1→2, with sum up to 1 being 4. dp[4][1] = 1 corresponds to path 1→3→1, so full path: 1→3→1→2 → sum = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 ✔  \nYes! So two paths: 1→2→4 and 1→3→1→2.\n\nSo dp counts seem plausible.\n\nThus for sum = 20, total = 47 + 34 + 30 + 21 = 132.\n\nTherefore answer to Problem 2 is **132**.\n\n---\n\nFinal answers:\n\n- Problem 1: 1  \n- Problem 2: 132\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The ratio r of backward probability (1/4) to forward probability (3/4) is (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3.
