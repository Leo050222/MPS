  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**:  \nFind all integer pairs $(m, n)$ satisfying  \n$$\nm^5 - n^5 = 16mn.\n$$  \nThen define $k = n - 1$, where $n$ is the **positive integer** appearing in the solution pair with **variables of opposite signs**, i.e., one of $m,n$ is positive and the other negative.\n\nSo we need to find integer solutions $(m,n)$ to $m^5 - n^5 = 16mn$, and among those where $m$ and $n$ have opposite signs and $n > 0$, pick that $n$, compute $k = n - 1$.\n\nLet’s analyze the equation:\n\n$$\nm^5 - n^5 = 16mn.\n$$\n\nNote: $m^5 - n^5 = (m - n)(m^4 + m^3 n + m^2 n^2 + m n^3 + n^4)$. But factoring may not help directly.\n\nTry small integer values.\n\nBecause of symmetry? Not symmetric — LHS is antisymmetric only if we swap and negate, but RHS is $16mn$, symmetric in sign change: if $(m,n)$ is a solution, then $(-m,-n)$ gives LHS $(-m)^5 - (-n)^5 = -m^5 + n^5 = -(m^5 - n^5)$, RHS $16(-m)(-n) = 16mn$, so $-(m^5 - n^5) = 16mn \\implies m^5 - n^5 = -16mn$. So not symmetric; sign changes give related but different equations.\n\nBut we’re told to look for solutions where $m$ and $n$ have **opposite signs**, and $n$ is **positive**, so $n > 0$, $m < 0$.\n\nLet’s set $m = -a$, where $a > 0$, $n > 0$. Then:\n\n$$\n(-a)^5 - n^5 = 16(-a)n \\Rightarrow -a^5 - n^5 = -16an \\Rightarrow a^5 + n^5 = 16an.\n$$\n\nSo now both $a,n > 0$ integers satisfying:\n\n$$\na^5 + n^5 = 16an. \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nSince $a,n$ are positive integers, LHS grows quickly; RHS is linear in each variable. So only small values possible.\n\nTry small $n$:\n\n- $n = 1$: Equation becomes $a^5 + 1 = 16a \\Rightarrow a^5 - 16a + 1 = 0$. Try $a = 1$: $1 - 16 + 1 = -14$. $a = 2$: $32 - 32 + 1 = 1$. $a = 3$: $243 - 48 + 1 = 196$. So no integer root.\n\n- $n = 2$: $a^5 + 32 = 32a \\Rightarrow a^5 - 32a + 32 = 0$. Try $a = 2$: $32 - 64 + 32 = 0$ → YES! So $a = 2$, $n = 2$. Then $m = -a = -2$, $n = 2$. Check original: $(-2)^5 - 2^5 = -32 - 32 = -64$, RHS $16mn = 16(-2)(2) = -64$. Yes! So $(m,n) = (-2,2)$ is a solution. Here $n = 2 > 0$, $m = -2 < 0$: opposite signs. So this qualifies.\n\nAre there others?\n\nContinue checking:\n\n- $n = 3$: $a^5 + 243 = 48a \\Rightarrow a^5 - 48a + 243 = 0$. Try $a = 3$: $243 - 144 + 243 = 342$. Too big. $a = 1$: $1 - 48 + 243 = 196$. $a = 2$: $32 - 96 + 243 = 179$. All positive. No root.\n\n- $n = 4$: $a^5 + 1024 = 64a \\Rightarrow a^5 - 64a + 1024 = 0$. $a = 4$: $1024 - 256 + 1024 = 1792$. Way too big. LHS dominates.\n\nWhat about $n = 0$? But $n$ must be positive per problem statement.\n\nWhat about $n = 16$? Unlikely — $n^5$ huge.\n\nBut maybe $a = n$? Try $a = n$: then $2n^5 = 16n^2 \\Rightarrow 2n^5 - 16n^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2n^2(n^3 - 8) = 0 \\Rightarrow n = 0$ or $n^3 = 8 \\Rightarrow n = 2$. So $n = 2$, $a = 2$ is the only equal case. That matches our earlier solution.\n\nWhat about $a = 1$: then $1 + n^5 = 16n \\Rightarrow n^5 - 16n + 1 = 0$. Try $n = 1$: $1 - 16 + 1 = -14$. $n = 2$: $32 - 32 + 1 = 1$. So no integer root.\n\n$a = 3$: $243 + n^5 = 48n \\Rightarrow n^5 - 48n + 243 = 0$. Try $n = 3$: $243 - 144 + 243 = 342$. No.\n\nSo likely only solution with opposite signs and $n>0$ is $(m,n) = (-2,2)$. Then $k = n - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n\nBut wait — could there be another solution where $n$ is positive and $m$ is negative, but not $m = -n$?\n\nTry $n = 4$, $m = -1$: LHS = $(-1)^5 - 4^5 = -1 - 1024 = -1025$, RHS = $16(-1)(4) = -64$. Not equal.\n\n$m = -4$, $n = 1$: LHS = $(-4)^5 - 1 = -1024 - 1 = -1025$, RHS = $16(-4)(1) = -64$. No.\n\n$m = -1$, $n = 2$: $-1 - 32 = -33$, RHS = $16(-1)(2) = -32$. Close but no.\n\n$m = -3$, $n = 1$: $-243 - 1 = -244$, RHS = $-48$.\n\n$m = -2$, $n = 1$: $-32 - 1 = -33$, RHS = $-32$.\n\n$m = -2$, $n = 3$: $-32 - 243 = -275$, RHS = $16(-2)(3) = -96$.\n\nSo only $(-2,2)$ works among small values.\n\nAlso check $(m,n) = (2,-2)$: then $m>0$, $n<0$, but problem says “$n$ is the positive integer appearing in the solution pair with variables of opposite signs”, so only cases where $n>0$, $m<0$ count. So only $(-2,2)$ qualifies.\n\nThus $k = n - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n\n✅ Answer 1: **1**\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**:  \nGiven cubic polynomial  \n$$\nx^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48\n$$  \nwith three **positive** roots $p < q < r$, all positive reals.\n\nBy Vieta:\n- $p + q + r = a$\n- $pq + qr + rp = b$\n- $pqr = 48$\n\nWe are to minimize  \n$$\n\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{2}{q} + \\frac{3}{r}.\n$$\n\nAll variables $p,q,r > 0$, $p<q<r$, $pqr = 48$.\n\nWe need to minimize $S = \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{2}{q} + \\frac{3}{r}$ subject to $pqr = 48$, $0 < p < q < r$.\n\nThis is an inequality optimization problem. Since the constraint is symmetric in a multiplicative way but the objective is weighted, likely minimum occurs when variables are chosen to balance the \"cost\" per unit of product.\n\nUse AM-GM or Lagrange multipliers? But with ordering constraint $p<q<r$, the minimum may occur at boundary or interior.\n\nBut perhaps the minimum occurs when equality conditions of weighted AM-GM hold — i.e., set up Lagrangian:\n\nLet $f(p,q,r) = \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{2}{q} + \\frac{3}{r}$, constraint $g(p,q,r) = \\ln p + \\ln q + \\ln r = \\ln 48$.\n\nSet $\\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g$:\n\nPartial derivatives:\n\n- $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} = -\\frac{1}{p^2},\\quad \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p} = \\frac{1}{p}$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q} = -\\frac{2}{q^2},\\quad \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial q} = \\frac{1}{q}$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r} = -\\frac{3}{r^2},\\quad \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial r} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{p^2} = \\lambda \\cdot \\frac{1}{p} \\Rightarrow \\lambda = -\\frac{1}{p}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{2}{q^2} = \\lambda \\cdot \\frac{1}{q} \\Rightarrow \\lambda = -\\frac{2}{q}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{3}{r^2} = \\lambda \\cdot \\frac{1}{r} \\Rightarrow \\lambda = -\\frac{3}{r}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{p} = -\\frac{2}{q} = -\\frac{3}{r} \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{2}{q} = \\frac{3}{r}\n$$\n\nLet common value be $t$, so:\n\n- $1/p = t \\Rightarrow p = 1/t$\n- $2/q = t \\Rightarrow q = 2/t$\n- $3/r = t \\Rightarrow r = 3/t$\n\nThen $pqr = \\frac{1}{t} \\cdot \\frac{2}{t} \\cdot \\frac{3}{t} = \\frac{6}{t^3} = 48 \\Rightarrow t^3 = \\frac{6}{48} = \\frac{1}{8} \\Rightarrow t = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThus:\n\n- $p = 1/t = 2$\n- $q = 2/t = 4$\n- $r = 3/t = 6$\n\nCheck ordering: $2 < 4 < 6$: OK.\n\nCheck product: $2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 = 48$: yes.\n\nNow compute objective:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{2}{q} + \\frac{3}{r} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\n$$\n\nIs this the minimum? Since the Lagrangian critical point satisfies ordering and constraint, and the function tends to infinity as any variable approaches 0 or ∞ (e.g., $p \\to 0^+$ makes $1/p \\to \\infty$; $r \\to \\infty$ makes $3/r \\to 0$ but then $p$ or $q$ must go to 0 to keep product 48, blowing up), this critical point is likely the global minimum.\n\nAlso, since weights increase (1,2,3) and denominators increase (p<q<r), assigning larger denominator to larger weight makes sense — and indeed we assigned largest $r$ to largest coefficient 3.\n\nSo minimum is $3/2$.\n\n✅ Answer 2: **1.5** or as fraction **3/2**. The problem says \"minimum possible value\", and 3/2 is exact.\n\nBut let's confirm no smaller value possible with integer roots? The roots don’t have to be integers, but in this case they turned out integers. Suppose we try nearby values:\n\nSay $p = 1.9$, then to keep $pqr = 48$, need $qr = 48/1.9 \\approx 25.26$. Try $q = 4.1$, then $r = 25.26 / 4.1 \\approx 6.16$. Compute $1/1.9 + 2/4.1 + 3/6.16 \\approx 0.526 + 0.488 + 0.487 = 1.501 > 1.5$. Slightly larger.\n\nSo yes, minimum is $3/2$.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers:\n\n- Problem 1: $k = 1$\n- Problem 2: $\\frac{3}{2}$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We seek integer solutions (m,n) to m^5 - n^5 = 16mn with m and n of opposite signs and n positive. Substituting m = -a (a > 0) yields a^5 + n^5 = 16an. Testing small values shows (a,n) = (2,2) works, giving (m,n) = (-2,2). This is the only such solution with opposite signs and n > 0. Thus k = n - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. Problem 2: Given positive roots p < q < r of x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48, with pqr = 48, we minimize S = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r. Using Lagrange multipliers under constraint pqr = 48, we find critical point when 1/p = 2/q = 3/r = t. Solving yields p = 2, q = 4, r = 6, satisfying pqr = 48 and p < q < r. Then S = 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/6 = 3/2. This is the global minimum as confirmed by boundary behavior and local testing.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
