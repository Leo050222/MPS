  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> I have 8 unit cubes of different colors, which I want to glue together into a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ cube. How many distinct $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ cubes can I make? Rotations of the same cube are not considered distinct, but reflections are. Instead of determining the number of distinct cubes up to rotations, simply find $k = m - 34$, where $m$ is the number of ways to choose which of the remaining cubes occupy the positions adjacent to the fixed cube, derived from the analysis of fixing one cube's position to account for rotational symmetry.\n\nLet’s parse carefully.\n\nWe have 8 distinguishable (colored) unit cubes. We assemble them into a $2\\times2\\times2$ cube — i.e., a cube made of 8 smaller cubes, each occupying one of the 8 corner positions.\n\nWe want to count distinct colorings *up to rotation* (reflections *are* considered distinct), i.e., two colorings related by a rotation are considered the same; reflections are *not* identified — so we’re counting orbits under the action of the **rotation group of the cube**, not the full symmetry group (which includes reflections).\n\nStandard approach: Use Burnside’s Lemma or fix one cube to break symmetry.\n\nThe problem says: “Instead of determining the number of distinct cubes up to rotations, simply find $k = m - 34$, where $m$ is the number of ways to choose which of the remaining cubes occupy the positions adjacent to the fixed cube, derived from the analysis of fixing one cube's position to account for rotational symmetry.”\n\nSo they are guiding us through a standard symmetry reduction: fix one colored cube at a particular position (say, the “bottom-front-left” corner) to eliminate rotational symmetry. Since all cubes are distinct, fixing one cube’s position removes the overcounting due to rotations.\n\nBut how many rotational symmetries does a cube have? The rotation group of the cube has **24 elements** (the orientation-preserving symmetries: 6 faces × 4 rotations = 24). So total number of colorings without considering symmetry is $8! = 40320$. Dividing by 24 gives $40320 / 24 = 1680$ distinct cubes up to rotation.\n\nBut the problem doesn’t ask for that directly. It defines:\n\n- Fix one cube’s position (to account for rotational symmetry). Since all cubes are distinct, we can fix, say, the red cube at a particular corner. That leaves 7! = 5040 ways to assign the remaining cubes to the other 7 positions.\n\nBut wait — the problem says: “$m$ is the number of ways to choose which of the remaining cubes occupy the positions *adjacent to the fixed cube*”.\n\nIn a $2\\times2\\times2$ cube, each corner (unit cube) is adjacent (i.e., shares a face) with **3 other cubes**, because each corner touches three others along x, y, z directions.\n\nLet’s verify: In a $2\\times2\\times2$ cube, coordinates are all $(x,y,z)$ where $x,y,z \\in \\{0,1\\}$. Each corner has exactly three neighbors differing in exactly one coordinate. So yes — degree 3.\n\nSo if we fix one cube at, say, position $(0,0,0)$, then its three adjacent positions are:\n\n- $(1,0,0)$ — along x-axis  \n- $(0,1,0)$ — along y-axis  \n- $(0,0,1)$ — along z-axis  \n\nSo there are **3 positions adjacent to the fixed cube**.\n\nThe problem says: “$m$ is the number of ways to choose which of the remaining cubes occupy the positions adjacent to the fixed cube”.\n\nWe have 7 remaining distinct cubes. We need to assign 3 of them to those 3 adjacent positions — order matters, since positions are distinct (e.g., x-, y-, z-directions are distinguishable *relative to the fixed cube*, but after fixing the cube’s position and orientation, those positions are distinct).\n\nSo number of injective assignments of 3 distinct cubes to 3 labeled positions = $P(7,3) = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 = 210$.\n\nThus $m = 210$.\n\nThen $k = m - 34 = 210 - 34 = 176$.\n\nWait — is that correct? Let's double-check interpretation.\n\nAlternative interpretation: Maybe “choose which cubes occupy the adjacent positions” means *selecting the set* (unordered), not assigning. But the phrase says “occupy the positions”, plural, and positions are distinct, so likely assignment (ordered). Also, 7×6×5 = 210 is standard.\n\nAnd 210 − 34 = 176.\n\nBut why 34? Is there a reason 34 appears? Let's see if 34 is meaningful.\n\nTotal number of ways to assign remaining 7 cubes to remaining 7 positions is 7! = 5040.\n\nNumber of ways to assign cubes to the 3 adjacent positions and then the rest: $P(7,3) \\times 4! = 210 \\times 24 = 5040$, consistent.\n\nSo yes, $m = P(7,3) = 210$.\n\nHence $k = 210 - 34 = 176$.\n\nSo answer to Problem 1 is **176**.\n\nHold on — let’s ensure no trick. The problem says: “derived from the analysis of fixing one cube's position to account for rotational symmetry.” When we fix one cube’s position, we eliminate rotational symmetry — but does fixing it at a corner fully break all symmetry? Actually, no — some rotations may keep that corner fixed. For example, rotations around the corner — but in the cube group, the stabilizer of a corner is the set of rotations that map that corner to itself. How many such rotations?\n\nA corner is incident to 3 faces. Rotations fixing a corner correspond to permutations of the three adjacent edges — i.e., the 3! = 6 rotations that permute the x,y,z axes — but only the even ones? Wait, the stabilizer of a corner in the rotation group has size 3: actually, let’s recall:\n\nThe rotation group acts transitively on the 8 corners, and |G| = 24, so stabilizer size = 24 / 8 = **3**.\n\nYes! Because orbit-stabilizer: orbit size = 8 (corners), group size = 24 ⇒ stabilizer size = 3.\n\nSo if we fix a particular corner position (say, (0,0,0)), there are 3 rotations that keep that corner in place: the identity, and two nontrivial rotations — specifically, 120° and 240° rotations about the space diagonal through that corner and the opposite corner.\n\nBut the problem says “fixing one cube's position to account for rotational symmetry” — usually, to eliminate symmetry, you fix *both position and orientation*, i.e., fix not just which corner the cube goes to, but also how it’s oriented — but unit cubes have no orientation (they’re just colored blocks, no internal orientation), so fixing the cube at a corner eliminates all but the stabilizer.\n\nHowever, the problem seems to be using a simplified method: fix one cube at a corner — then consider assignments of others. And then defines $m$ as number of ways to assign cubes to the *three adjacent positions*. Since the stabilizer has size 3, perhaps some further division is implied? But the problem explicitly says: “$m$ is the number of ways to choose which of the remaining cubes occupy the positions adjacent to the fixed cube, derived from the analysis…”, and then compute $k = m - 34$.\n\nGiven that, and that 7×6×5 = 210 is natural, and 210 − 34 = 176, and no other obvious value fits, we’ll go with **176**.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> Find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial $P(x)=x^{4}-29 x^{3}+a x^{2}+b x+c$, given that $P(5)=11, P(11)=17$, and $P(17)=23$.\n\nRecall: Sum of coefficients of a polynomial $P(x)$ is $P(1)$.\n\nSo we need to find $P(1)$.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- $P(x) = x^4 - 29x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c$\n- $P(5) = 11$\n- $P(11) = 17$\n- $P(17) = 23$\n\nWe need $P(1) = 1 - 29 + a + b + c = a + b + c - 28$\n\nSo if we can find $a + b + c$, we’re done.\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1. $P(5) = 5^4 - 29 \\cdot 5^3 + a \\cdot 5^2 + b \\cdot 5 + c = 11$  \n2. $P(11) = 11^4 - 29 \\cdot 11^3 + a \\cdot 11^2 + b \\cdot 11 + c = 17$  \n3. $P(17) = 17^4 - 29 \\cdot 17^3 + a \\cdot 17^2 + b \\cdot 17 + c = 23$\n\nLet’s compute the known parts.\n\nFirst, define $Q(x) = x^4 - 29x^3$. Then $P(x) = Q(x) + a x^2 + b x + c$.\n\nSo:\n\n- $P(5) = Q(5) + 25a + 5b + c = 11$  \n- $P(11) = Q(11) + 121a + 11b + c = 17$  \n- $P(17) = Q(17) + 289a + 17b + c = 23$\n\nCompute $Q(x)$ values:\n\n- $5^4 = 625$, $5^3 = 125$, so $Q(5) = 625 - 29·125 = 625 - 3625 = -3000$\n\nCheck: 29×125 = (30−1)×125 = 3750 − 125 = 3625 → yes. So $Q(5) = 625 − 3625 = -3000$\n\n- $11^4 = 14641$, $11^3 = 1331$, so $Q(11) = 14641 − 29·1331$\n\nCompute 29×1331: 1331×30 = 39930, minus 1331 = 38599\n\nSo $Q(11) = 14641 − 38599 = -23958$\n\n- $17^4 = (17^2)^2 = 289^2 = 83521$, $17^3 = 4913$, so $Q(17) = 83521 − 29·4913$\n\nCompute 29×4913: 4913×30 = 147390, minus 4913 = 142477\n\nSo $Q(17) = 83521 − 142477 = -58956$\n\nNow write equations:\n\n1. $-3000 + 25a + 5b + c = 11$ → $25a + 5b + c = 3011$  ...(i)  \n2. $-23958 + 121a + 11b + c = 17$ → $121a + 11b + c = 23975$ ...(ii)  \n3. $-58956 + 289a + 17b + c = 23$ → $289a + 17b + c = 58979$ ...(iii)\n\nNow subtract (i) from (ii):\n\n(ii) − (i): $(121a - 25a) + (11b - 5b) + (c - c) = 23975 - 3011$  \n→ $96a + 6b = 20964$  \nDivide by 6: $16a + b = 3494$ ...(A)\n\nSimilarly, (iii) − (ii):  \n$(289a - 121a) + (17b - 11b) + (c - c) = 58979 - 23975 = 35004$  \n→ $168a + 6b = 35004$  \nDivide by 6: $28a + b = 5834$ ...(B)\n\nNow subtract (A) from (B):  \n$(28a - 16a) + (b - b) = 5834 - 3494$ → $12a = 2340$ → $a = 195$\n\nPlug into (A): $16·195 + b = 3494$  \n16×195 = 3120 → $b = 3494 − 3120 = 374$\n\nNow plug a,b into (i): $25a + 5b + c = 3011$  \n25×195 = 4875  \n5×374 = 1870  \nSo 4875 + 1870 = 6745  \nThen $c = 3011 − 6745 = -3734$\n\nSo $a = 195$, $b = 374$, $c = -3734$\n\nThen $P(1) = 1 - 29 + a + b + c = -28 + (195 + 374 − 3734) = -28 + (569 − 3734) = -28 − 3165 = -3193$\n\nWait: 195 + 374 = 569; 569 − 3734 = −3165; −3165 − 28 = −3193.\n\nBut let’s verify with another equation to be safe.\n\nCheck (ii): $121a + 11b + c = 121×195 + 11×374 − 3734$\n\n121×195: 100×195 = 19500, 20×195 = 3900, 1×195 = 195 → total = 19500+3900+195 = 23595  \n11×374 = 4114  \nSo 23595 + 4114 = 27709; 27709 − 3734 = 23975 → matches RHS. Good.\n\nSo $P(1) = -3193$\n\nBut wait — is there a smarter way? Notice that $P(5)=11$, $P(11)=17$, $P(17)=23$: these outputs increase by 6 each time input increases by 6. So $P(x)$ at $x = 5,11,17$ lies on a line: $y = x + 6$, since 5+6=11, 11+6=17, 17+6=23.\n\nSo define $R(x) = P(x) - (x + 6)$. Then $R(5) = R(11) = R(17) = 0$. So $R(x)$ has roots at $x = 5, 11, 17$. Since $P(x)$ is degree 4, $R(x)$ is also degree 4 (leading term $x^4$), so $R(x)$ is divisible by $(x-5)(x-11)(x-17)$, a cubic. So we can write:\n\n$$\nR(x) = (x-5)(x-11)(x-17)(x - r)\n$$\n\nfor some $r$, since it's monic? Wait: $P(x)$ is monic (leading coefficient 1), and $x+6$ has degree 1, so $R(x)$ is monic quartic. So yes,\n\n$$\nP(x) = (x-5)(x-11)(x-17)(x - r) + x + 6\n$$\n\nNow expand or evaluate at $x = 1$:\n\n$$\nP(1) = (1-5)(1-11)(1-17)(1 - r) + 1 + 6 = (-4)(-10)(-16)(1 - r) + 7\n$$\n\nCompute $(-4)(-10) = 40$, $40 × (-16) = -640$, so:\n\n$$\nP(1) = -640(1 - r) + 7 = -640 + 640r + 7 = 640r - 633\n$$\n\nSo if we can find $r$, we get $P(1)$.\n\nBut we also know the coefficient of $x^3$ in $P(x)$ is $-29$.\n\nLet’s compute coefficient of $x^3$ in $(x-5)(x-11)(x-17)(x - r)$.\n\nFirst, $(x-5)(x-11)(x-17)$ is a monic cubic: $x^3 - (5+11+17)x^2 + (\\text{sum of pairwise products})x - (5·11·17)$\n\nSum of roots = 5+11+17 = 33, so cubic is $x^3 - 33x^2 + sx - t$\n\nMultiply by $(x - r)$: $(x^3 - 33x^2 + sx - t)(x - r) = x^4 - r x^3 - 33x^3 + 33r x^2 + s x^2 - s r x - t x + t r$\n\nBetter: general expansion: $(x^3 + A x^2 + B x + C)(x - r) = x^4 + (A - r)x^3 + (B - A r)x^2 + (C - B r)x - C r$\n\nHere, for cubic $(x-5)(x-11)(x-17)$, coefficients:\n\n- Sum of roots = 5+11+17 = 33 → coefficient of $x^2$ is $-33$\n- Sum of pairwise products = 5·11 + 5·17 + 11·17 = 55 + 85 + 187 = 327 → coefficient of $x$ is $+327$\n- Product = 5·11·17 = 5·187 = 935 → constant term = $-935$\n\nSo cubic = $x^3 - 33x^2 + 327x - 935$\n\nNow multiply by $(x - r)$:\n\n- $x^4$\n- $x^3$: $-r x^3 - 33 x^3 = -(r + 33)x^3$\n- So coefficient of $x^3$ in quartic is $-(r + 33)$\n\nThen $P(x) = [x^4 - (r+33)x^3 + \\dots] + x + 6$\n\nSo coefficient of $x^3$ in $P(x)$ is $-(r + 33)$. But given it's $-29$, so:\n\n$$\n-(r + 33) = -29 \\implies r + 33 = 29 \\implies r = -4\n$$\n\nGreat! So $r = -4$\n\nThen $P(1) = 640r - 633 = 640(-4) - 633 = -2560 - 633 = -3193$\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo answer is **-3193**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers:\n\n- Problem 1: $k = 176$  \n- Problem 2: $P(1) = -3193$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: With 8 distinct colored unit cubes forming a 2x2x2 cube, fixing one cube at a corner leaves 7 remaining cubes.
