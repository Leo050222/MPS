  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\nWe are told:\n\n- $ f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N} $ is **strictly increasing**,  \n- $ f(1) = 1 $,  \n- For all $ n \\in \\mathbb{N} $,  \n  $$\n  f(2n) \\cdot f(2n+1) = 9f(n)^2 + 3f(n)\n  $$\n\nWe are to compute $ k = f(68) - 730 $. So we need $ f(68) $.\n\nLet’s try to deduce the form of $ f(n) $.\n\nGiven the recurrence involves $ f(2n) $ and $ f(2n+1) $ in a product, and the RHS is quadratic in $ f(n) $, perhaps $ f(n) $ has a simple closed form — maybe linear? Try $ f(n) = an + b $. But $ f(1) = 1 $, so $ a + b = 1 $. Also strictly increasing ⇒ $ a > 0 $. Try $ f(n) = n $. Then LHS: $ f(2n)f(2n+1) = (2n)(2n+1) = 4n^2 + 2n $. RHS: $ 9n^2 + 3n $. Not equal.\n\nTry $ f(n) = 3n - 2 $? Then $ f(1) = 1 $, OK. $ f(2) = 4 $, $ f(3) = 7 $, then check for $ n = 1 $:  \nLHS: $ f(2)f(3) = 4 \\cdot 7 = 28 $  \nRHS: $ 9f(1)^2 + 3f(1) = 9(1) + 3 = 12 $. No.\n\nTry $ f(n) = 3n - 2 $ doesn’t work.\n\nMaybe exponential? Try $ f(n) = a^n $. Then $ f(1) = a = 1 $ → constant, not strictly increasing.\n\nTry $ f(n) = 3f(n-1) + c $ — but recurrence is multiplicative over even/odd pairs.\n\nLet’s compute small values manually using the recurrence and strict monotonicity.\n\nWe know:\n- $ f(1) = 1 $\n\nUse $ n = 1 $:  \n$ f(2) f(3) = 9f(1)^2 + 3f(1) = 9 + 3 = 12 $\n\nSo $ f(2) f(3) = 12 $, with $ f(1) < f(2) < f(3) $, all natural numbers.\n\nPossible factor pairs of 12 with $ f(2) < f(3) $:  \n(1,12), (2,6), (3,4)\n\nBut $ f(2) > f(1) = 1 $, so $ f(2) \\ge 2 $. Also $ f(2) < f(3) $.\n\nSo possible:\n- $ f(2)=2, f(3)=6 $\n- $ f(2)=3, f(3)=4 $\n\nWhich one satisfies strict increase going forward? Let's hold both options and test further.\n\nAlso, $ f $ maps to $ \\mathbb{N} $, i.e., positive integers.\n\nNow use $ n = 2 $:  \n$ f(4) f(5) = 9f(2)^2 + 3f(2) $\n\nSimilarly, $ n = 3 $:  \n$ f(6) f(7) = 9f(3)^2 + 3f(3) $\n\nAnd $ f $ must be strictly increasing overall:  \n$ f(1)=1 < f(2) < f(3) < f(4) < f(5) < f(6) < f(7) < \\dots $\n\nLet’s try option A: $ f(2)=2, f(3)=6 $\n\nThen:\n- $ f(1)=1 $, $ f(2)=2 $, $ f(3)=6 $ → OK so far.\n\nNow $ n=2 $:  \n$ f(4)f(5) = 9*(2)^2 + 3*2 = 36 + 6 = 42 $\n\nFactor pairs of 42 with $ f(4) > f(3)=6 $, $ f(5) > f(4) $, both integers.\n\nSo $ f(4) \\ge 7 $, $ f(5) > f(4) $, and $ f(4)f(5)=42 $. Possible integer pairs (a,b) with a<b, a*b=42:\n\n(1,42), (2,21), (3,14), (6,7)\n\nOnly pair with $ a \\ge 7 $ is (6,7), but $ a=6 $ not >6 (needs > f(3)=6 ⇒ ≥7). So no pair with $ a \\ge 7 $. So (6,7) gives $ f(4)=6 $, but $ f(4) > f(3)=6 $ ⇒ must be at least 7 ⇒ impossible. So option A fails.\n\nTry option B: $ f(2)=3, f(3)=4 $\n\nThen sequence so far: $ f(1)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=4 $. Strictly increasing? Yes: 1 < 3 < 4.\n\nNow $ n=2 $:  \n$ f(4)f(5) = 9*(3)^2 + 3*3 = 81 + 9 = 90 $\n\nWe need $ f(4) > f(3)=4 $, $ f(5) > f(4) $, integers, product 90.\n\nList factor pairs (a,b), a < b, a*b=90:\n\n(1,90), (2,45), (3,30), (5,18), (6,15), (9,10)\n\nWe need $ a > 4 $, so possible a: 5,6,9,...\n\nSo candidates:\n- (5,18): f(4)=5, f(5)=18\n- (6,15): f(4)=6, f(5)=15\n- (9,10): f(4)=9, f(5)=10\n\nAll satisfy f(4) > 4 and f(5) > f(4).\n\nNow also need $ f(6)f(7) = 9f(3)^2 + 3f(3) = 9*16 + 12 = 144 + 12 = 156 $\n\nSince $ f(4) < f(5) < f(6) < f(7) $, and $ f(5) $ is known in each case, we can test consistency.\n\nAlso $ n = 4 $ gives $ f(8)f(9) = 9f(4)^2 + 3f(4) $, etc.\n\nBut maybe there's a pattern. Let's hypothesize that $ f(n) = 3n - 2 $ was wrong, but what about $ f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{3n}{2} \\right\\rfloor $ or something? Unlikely.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe $ f(n) = a_n $ where $ a_{2n} $ and $ a_{2n+1} $ are roots of quadratic $ x y = 9a_n^2 + 3a_n $, and since function is strictly increasing, perhaps $ f(2n) $ and $ f(2n+1) $ are consecutive integers? Or differ by 1?\n\nIn option B, for n=1: f(2)=3, f(3)=4 → consecutive.\n\nFor n=2: f(4)f(5)=90. If they’re consecutive, solve $ x(x+1)=90 \\Rightarrow x^2+x-90=0 \\Rightarrow x=(−1±√361)/2 = (−1±19)/2 → x=9 or −10. So x=9, x+1=10 → 9×10=90. So f(4)=9, f(5)=10 works! And 9>4, 10>9, OK.\n\nSo try:\n- f(1)=1  \n- f(2)=3, f(3)=4  \n- f(4)=9, f(5)=10  \n\nCheck ordering: 1 < 3 < 4 < 9 < 10 — OK.\n\nNow n=3: f(6)f(7) = 9f(3)^2 + 3f(3) = 9*16 + 12 = 144 + 12 = 156\n\nTry consecutive integers: x(x+1)=156 → x²+x−156=0 → discriminant = 1 + 624 = 625 = 25² → x = (−1 ± 25)/2 = 12 or −13 → x=12, so 12×13 = 156. So f(6)=12, f(7)=13.\n\nSequence now:  \nf(1)=1  \nf(2)=3  \nf(3)=4  \nf(4)=9  \nf(5)=10  \nf(6)=12  \nf(7)=13  \n\nCheck ordering: 1 < 3 < 4 < 9 < 10 < 12 < 13 — OK.\n\nNow n=4: f(8)f(9) = 9f(4)^2 + 3f(4) = 9*81 + 27 = 729 + 27 = 756\n\nConsecutive? x(x+1)=756 → x²+x−756=0 → disc = 1 + 3024 = 3025 = 55² → x = (−1 ± 55)/2 = 27 or −28 → 27×28 = 756. So f(8)=27, f(9)=28.\n\nSequence continues: … <13 <27<28 — OK.\n\nn=5: f(10)f(11) = 9f(5)^2 + 3f(5) = 9*100 + 30 = 900 + 30 = 930  \nx(x+1)=930 → x²+x−930=0 → disc = 1 + 3720 = 3721 = 61² → x=(−1±61)/2 = 30 → 30×31 = 930. So f(10)=30, f(11)=31.\n\nn=6: f(12)f(13) = 9f(6)^2 + 3f(6) = 9*144 + 36 = 1296 + 36 = 1332  \nx(x+1)=1332 → x²+x−1332=0 → disc = 1 + 5328 = 5329 = 73² → x=(−1±73)/2 = 36 → 36×37 = 1332. So f(12)=36, f(13)=37.\n\nn=7: f(14)f(15) = 9f(7)^2 + 3f(7) = 9*169 + 39 = 1521 + 39 = 1560  \nx(x+1)=1560 → x²+x−1560=0 → disc = 1 + 6240 = 6241 = 79² → x=(−1±79)/2 = 39 → 39×40 = 1560. So f(14)=39, f(15)=40.\n\nSo far, pattern seems to be:\n\n- f(1) = 1  \n- f(2) = 3  \n- f(3) = 4  \n- f(4) = 9  \n- f(5) = 10  \n- f(6) = 12  \n- f(7) = 13  \n- f(8) = 27  \n- f(9) = 28  \n- f(10) = 30  \n- f(11) = 31  \n- f(12) = 36  \n- f(13) = 37  \n- f(14) = 39  \n- f(15) = 40  \n\nLet’s list n and f(n):\n\n| n | f(n) |\n|---|------|\n| 1 | 1    |\n| 2 | 3    |\n| 3 | 4    |\n| 4 | 9    |\n| 5 | 10   |\n| 6 | 12   |\n| 7 | 13   |\n| 8 | 27   |\n| 9 | 28   |\n|10 | 30   |\n|11 | 31   |\n|12 | 36   |\n|13 | 37   |\n|14 | 39   |\n|15 | 40   |\n\nNotice something? Look at binary representations or group by powers of 2.\n\nObserve:\n\n- For n=1: f(1)=1  \n- n=2,3: f=3,4 → range size 2  \n- n=4–7: f=9,10,12,13 → values: 9,10,12,13 — missing 11? So not contiguous.\n\nBut earlier we assumed f(2n), f(2n+1) are consecutive integers. That gave consistent results so far.\n\nLet’s verify if this assumption holds in general.\n\nSuppose for all n, $ f(2n) = x $, $ f(2n+1) = x+1 $, then $ x(x+1) = 9f(n)^2 + 3f(n) $. So $ x^2 + x - (9f(n)^2 + 3f(n)) = 0 $. Discriminant: $ 1 + 4(9f(n)^2 + 3f(n)) = 1 + 36f(n)^2 + 12f(n) = (6f(n) + 1)^2 $. Indeed:\n\n$ (6f(n) + 1)^2 = 36f(n)^2 + 12f(n) + 1 $. Yes! So discriminant is perfect square, and solution:\n\n$ x = \\frac{-1 + (6f(n) + 1)}{2} = \\frac{6f(n)}{2} = 3f(n) $\n\nSo $ f(2n) = 3f(n) $, $ f(2n+1) = 3f(n) + 1 $\n\nThat’s huge! Let's verify:\n\nIf $ f(2n) = 3f(n) $, $ f(2n+1) = 3f(n) + 1 $, then product is $ 3f(n) \\cdot (3f(n)+1) = 9f(n)^2 + 3f(n) $ — matches recurrence!\n\nAlso, strictly increasing? Need to verify ordering.\n\nGiven $ f $ strictly increasing, and $ f(2n) = 3f(n) $, $ f(2n+1) = 3f(n)+1 $, then for $ n < m $, need $ f(2n+1) < f(2m) $, i.e., $ 3f(n)+1 < 3f(m) $, i.e., $ f(m) > f(n) + \\frac{1}{3} $, which holds since $ f $ integer-valued and increasing ⇒ $ f(m) \\ge f(n)+1 $, so OK.\n\nAlso $ f(2n) = 3f(n) $, $ f(2n+1) = 3f(n)+1 $, and $ f(2n+2) = f(2(n+1)) = 3f(n+1) $. Since $ f(n+1) > f(n) $, $ 3f(n+1) > 3f(n)+1 $ as long as $ f(n+1) \\ge f(n)+1 $, which holds.\n\nSo this functional equation is consistent with strict increase.\n\nThus, we have derived:\n\n> For all $ n \\in \\mathbb{N} $,\n> $$\n> f(2n) = 3f(n), \\quad f(2n+1) = 3f(n) + 1\n> $$\n> and $ f(1) = 1 $.\n\nThis is a well-defined recursive definition.\n\nLet’s verify with earlier values:\n\n- $ f(1) = 1 $  \n- $ f(2) = f(2·1) = 3f(1) = 3 $ ✓  \n- $ f(3) = f(2·1 + 1) = 3f(1) + 1 = 4 $ ✓  \n- $ f(4) = f(2·2) = 3f(2) = 9 $ ✓  \n- $ f(5) = f(2·2 + 1) = 3f(2) + 1 = 10 $ ✓  \n- $ f(6) = f(2·3) = 3f(3) = 12 $ ✓  \n- $ f(7) = f(2·3 + 1) = 3f(3) + 1 = 13 $ ✓  \n- $ f(8) = 3f(4) = 27 $ ✓  \n- $ f(9) = 3f(4)+1 = 28 $ ✓  \nAll match.\n\nGreat! So the function is fully determined by:\n\n- $ f(1) = 1 $  \n- $ f(2n) = 3f(n) $  \n- $ f(2n+1) = 3f(n) + 1 $\n\nThis resembles interpreting $ n $ in binary and mapping to base-3 representation.\n\nIndeed, this is a known bijection: write $ n $ in binary (without leading zeros), then interpret that string as a base-3 number.\n\nLet’s test:\n\n- n = 1 → binary \"1\" → base3 \"1\" = 1 ✓  \n- n = 2 → \"10\"_2 → \"10\"_3 = 3 ✓  \n- n = 3 → \"11\"_2 → \"11\"_3 = 3 + 1 = 4 ✓  \n- n = 4 → \"100\"_2 → \"100\"_3 = 9 ✓  \n- n = 5 → \"101\"_2 → \"101\"_3 = 9 + 0 + 1 = 10 ✓  \n- n = 6 → \"110\"_2 → \"110\"_3 = 9 + 3 + 0 = 12 ✓  \n- n = 7 → \"111\"_2 → \"111\"_3 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13 ✓  \nYes! So $ f(n) $ is the value obtained by taking binary representation of $ n $ and reading it as a base-3 number.\n\nTherefore, to compute $ f(68) $, write 68 in binary, then interpret as base-3.\n\n68 in binary:\n\n64 + 4 = 2^6 + 2^2 → 1000100₂\n\nCheck:  \n64 → 1  \n32 → 0  \n16 → 0  \n8 → 0  \n4 → 1  \n2 → 0  \n1 → 0  \nSo 68 = 1000100₂ (7 bits)\n\nNow interpret \"1000100\" as base-3 number:\n\nDigits from left (most significant) to right: 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0\n\nPositions (powers of 3): 3⁶, 3⁵, 3⁴, 3³, 3², 3¹, 3⁰\n\nSo:\n\n$ f(68) = 1·3^6 + 0·3^5 + 0·3^4 + 0·3^3 + 1·3^2 + 0·3^1 + 0·3^0 $  \n= $ 3^6 + 3^2 $  \n= $ 729 + 9 = 738 $\n\nThus $ k = f(68) - 730 = 738 - 730 = 8 $\n\nLet’s double-check binary of 68:\n\n68 ÷ 2 = 34 r0  \n34 ÷ 2 = 17 r0  \n17 ÷ 2 = 8 r1  \n8 ÷ 2 = 4 r0  \n4 ÷ 2 = 2 r0  \n2 ÷ 2 = 1 r0  \n1 ÷ 2 = 0 r1  \n\nReading remainders bottom-up: 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 → yes, 1000100₂.\n\n3⁶ = 729, 3² = 9, sum 738. Correct.\n\nSo answer to Problem 1 is **8**.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\nCount colorings of the 8 vertices of a cube with red/blue such that **no two adjacent vertices (connected by an edge) are both red**. Rotations/reflections are considered **distinct**, so no Burnside — just count all valid colorings.\n\nThis is counting the number of **independent sets** on the cube graph, where red = selected vertex, and no two reds are adjacent. Blue can be anywhere.\n\nSo we need the number of independent sets in the 3D cube graph $ Q_3 $.\n\nThe cube graph $ Q_3 $ has:\n- 8 vertices  \n- Each vertex degree 3  \n- It's bipartite (like all hypercubes), with bipartition into even and odd weight binary strings (e.g., number of 1s mod 2). So two sets of 4 vertices each, no edges within a part.\n\nLet’s denote the two parts as A and B, each size 4, all edges go between A and B.\n\nAn independent set can contain vertices only from A, or only from B, or some from A and some from B, but with no edge between them. Since all edges are between A and B, if we pick a vertex from A and one from B, they may or may not be adjacent — but in $ Q_3 $, each vertex in A is adjacent to exactly 3 vertices in B (since degree 3), and not to the remaining 1 in B.\n\nSo adjacency is not complete bipartite $ K_{4,4} $, but a 3-regular bipartite graph.\n\n$ Q_3 $ is the graph whose vertices are $ \\{0,1\\}^3 $, edges between strings differing in exactly one coordinate.\n\nBipartition: A = even parity (0 or 2 ones):  \n000, 011, 101, 110 → 4 vertices  \nB = odd parity: 001, 010, 100, 111 → 4 vertices\n\nEach vertex in A is adjacent to three in B: e.g., 000 differs in one bit from 001, 010, 100 → those three in B.\n\nSo neighborhood of each A-vertex is 3 distinct B-vertices.\n\nWe need number of subsets S of V such that no two in S are adjacent.\n\nStandard approach: use inclusion or recursion, but for $ Q_3 $, it's small enough to compute directly or use known value.\n\nI recall the number of independent sets in $ Q_n $ is known; for $ Q_3 $, it's 35? Let's compute carefully.\n\nLet’s denote $ i(G) $ = number of independent sets of graph G.\n\nWe can compute via case analysis.\n\nLet’s fix the bipartition A and B, each size 4.\n\nLet $ S $ be independent set. Let $ a = |S \\cap A| $, $ b = |S \\cap B| $. Since no edges inside A or B, the only restriction is that no vertex in $ S \\cap A $ is adjacent to any in $ S \\cap B $.\n\nSo for a given subset $ X \\subseteq A $, the allowed $ Y \\subseteq B $ are those disjoint from the neighborhood $ N(X) $, i.e., $ Y \\subseteq B \\setminus N(X) $.\n\nSo for each $ X \\subseteq A $, number of allowed $ Y $ is $ 2^{|B \\setminus N(X)|} = 2^{4 - |N(X)|} $.\n\nSo total independent sets = $ \\sum_{X \\subseteq A} 2^{4 - |N(X)|} $\n\nSo we need, for each possible $ X \\subseteq A $, the size of its neighborhood in B.\n\nSince the graph is symmetric, we can group by $ |X| = k $, and for each k, find how many X have neighborhood size d.\n\nA has 4 vertices: label them for concreteness.\n\nLet A = {000, 011, 101, 110}  \nB = {001, 010, 100, 111}\n\nCompute neighborhoods:\n\n- 000 ∈ A is adjacent to: flip each bit → 001, 010, 100 ∈ B  \nSo N(000) = {001, 010, 100}\n\n- 011 ∈ A: flip bit 1 → 111, flip bit 2 → 001, flip bit 3 → 010  \nSo N(011) = {111, 001, 010}\n\n- 101 ∈ A: flip bit 1 → 001, bit 2 → 111, bit 3 → 100  \nSo N(101) = {001, 111, 100}\n\n- 110 ∈ A: flip bit 1 → 010, bit 2 → 100, bit 3 → 111  \nSo N(110) = {010, 100, 111}\n\nSo each vertex in A has neighborhood of size 3, missing exactly one vertex in B.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- N(000) misses 111  \n- N(011) misses 100  \n- N(101) misses 010  \n- N(110) misses 001  \n\nLet’s verify:\n\nB = {001, 010, 100, 111}\n\n- N(000) = {001,010,100} → misses 111 ✓  \n- N(011) = {111,001,010} → misses 100 ✓  \n- N(101) = {001,111,100} → misses 010 ✓  \n- N(110) = {010,100,111} → misses 001 ✓  \n\nSo each A-vertex misses a distinct B-vertex. So the \"missing\" map is a bijection from A to B.\n\nNow, for a subset X ⊆ A, what is |N(X)|?\n\nSince each adds up to at most 4, and each misses a unique vertex, the union N(X) = B \\ {missed vertices of X}, i.e., N(X) = B minus the set of vertices missed by elements of X.\n\nBecause each v ∈ A misses a unique w ∈ B, and N(v) = B \\ {w_v}, so\n\nN(X) = ∩_{v∈X} N(v)? No, union.\n\nN(X) = ∪_{v∈X} N(v) = ∪_{v∈X} (B \\ {w_v}) = B \\ (∩_{v∈X} {w_v}) = B \\ {w_v : v∈X} only if the w_v are distinct, which they are.\n\nSince each v misses a distinct w, and there are 4 of each, the set {w_v : v∈X} has size |X|, and they are distinct.\n\nSo N(X) = B \\ {w_v : v∈X} ? No:\n\nN(v) = B \\ {w_v}, so ∪_{v∈X} (B \\ {w_v}) = B \\ (∩_{v∈X} {w_v}) = B \\ ∅ = B if |X|≥2? No, intersection of singletons is empty unless same element.\n\nActually, ∪ (B \\ {w_v}) = B \\ (∩ {w_v}) but ∩ of sets {w_v} is empty if more than one, since all w_v distinct.\n\nMore carefully:\n\n∪_{v∈X} (B \\ {w_v}) = B \\ (∩_{v∈X} {w_v})\n\nBut ∩_{v∈X} {w_v} is empty if |X| ≥ 2, since w_v are distinct. If |X|=1, ∩ is {w_v}. So:\n\n- If |X| = 0: N(∅) = ∅  \n- If |X| = 1: N(X) = B \\ {w_v}, size 3  \n- If |X| = 2: ∪ (B \\ {w_v}) = B \\ ({w_{v1}} ∩ {w_{v2}}) = B \\ ∅ = B, size 4  \n- Similarly for |X| ≥ 2: since all w_v distinct, the intersection is empty, so union is all of B.\n\nWait, is that true? Let's test.\n\nTake X = {000, 011}:  \nN(000) = {001,010,100}  \nN(011) = {111,001,010}  \nUnion = {001,010,100,111} = B. Yes.\n\nAny two A-vertices miss different B-vertices, so their neighborhoods cover all B.\n\nSimilarly, |X|=3 or 4 also give N(X)=B.\n\nSo:\n\n- |X| = 0: |N(X)| = 0  \n- |X| = 1: |N(X)| = 3  \n- |X| ≥ 2: |N(X)| = 4  \n\nNow, number of X ⊆ A:\n\n- |X| = 0: 1 subset, |N|=0 → contributes $ 2^{4 - 0} = 2^4 = 16 $  \n- |X| = 1: C(4,1) = 4 subsets, each |N|=3 → each contributes $ 2^{4-3} = 2^1 = 2 $, total 4×2 = 8  \n- |X| = 2: C(4,2) = 6 subsets, each |N|=4 → contributes $ 2^{4-4} = 2^0 = 1 $, total 6×1 = 6  \n- |X| = 3: C(4,3) = 4 subsets, each contributes 1 → total 4  \n- |X| = 4: C(4,4) = 1 subset, contributes 1 → total 1  \n\nSum = 16 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 35\n\nBut wait — does this include the empty set? Yes, when X=∅ and Y=∅, that's the all-blue coloring. Valid.\n\nSo total independent sets = 35.\n\nBut is that correct? Let me verify with another method.\n\nAlternative: use recurrence or known values.\n\nI recall that the number of independent sets in $ Q_3 $ is indeed 35. (Quick search in mind: OEIS A000016 or similar — but let's trust derivation.)\n\nDouble-check counts:\n\n- X=∅: Y can be any subset of B, since no restriction → 2^4 = 16  \n- X singleton: say X={000}, then N(X)={001,010,100}, so Y must avoid these, i.e., Y ⊆ B \\ N(X) = {111}, so Y can be ∅ or {111} → 2 options. Same for each of 4 choices → 8  \n- X size 2: N(X)=B, so B \\ N(X) = ∅, so Y must be ∅ only → 1 option per X → 6  \n- X size 3: same, Y=∅ → 4  \n- X size 4: Y=∅ → 1  \nTotal: 16+8+6+4+1 = 35.\n\nYes.\n\nSo number of valid colorings = 35.\n\nBut wait — problem says \"colored red and blue such that no two points connected by an edge are both red\". So red vertices form an independent set; blue can be anything else. So yes, exactly the number of independent sets.\n\nSo answer is 35.\n\nBut let me make sure we didn’t miss anything. Is there any restriction on blue? No. So all independent sets correspond to choosing red vertices as independent set, rest blue. So yes, 35.\n\nThus answer to Problem 2 is **35**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The function f satisfies f(2n) = 3f(n) and f(2n+1) = 3f(n) + 1 with f(1) = 1. This corresponds to interpreting the binary representation of n as a base-3 number. For n = 68, binary is 1000100₂, which interpreted in base 3 is 3^6 + 3^2 = 729 + 9 = 738. Thus f(68) - 730 = 8. Problem 2: The condition is equivalent to counting independent sets in the 3D cube graph Q_3. Using bipartition into even and odd parity vertices (each size 4), and analyzing neighborhood sizes, the total number of independent sets is calculated as 35.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"8\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"35\"\n}",
