  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n**Statement**:  \nAlice draws three cards from a standard 52-card deck **with replacement**. Card values:\n\n- Ace = 1, 2–10 = face value,  \n- Jack, Queen, King = each worth 10 points.\n\nSo possible point values per card: {1, 2, ..., 10}, with different frequencies.\n\nLet’s find the distribution of point values for a single draw.\n\nIn a standard deck:\n- Each rank appears 4 times (one per suit).\n- Ranks: A, 2–10, J, Q, K → total 13 ranks.\n\nSo:\n- Value 1 (Ace): 4 cards  \n- Values 2 through 9: each has 4 cards → 8 × 4 = 32 cards  \n- Value 10: 4 (10s) + 4 (J) + 4 (Q) + 4 (K) = 16 cards  \n\nSo value distribution per draw:\n\n| Value v | Count | Probability p_v = count / 52 |\n|---------|--------|-------------------------------|\n| 1       | 4      | 4/52 = 1/13                   |\n| 2       | 4      | 1/13                          |\n| ...     | ...    | ...                           |\n| 9       | 4      | 1/13                          |\n| 10      | 16     | 16/52 = 4/13                  |\n\nSo:\n- For v = 1 to 9: p_v = 1/13  \n- For v = 10: p_v = 4/13  \n\nCheck sum: 9 × (1/13) + 4/13 = 9/13 + 4/13 = 13/13 = 1 ✅\n\nWe draw **three times with replacement**, so independent draws.\n\nLet X₁, X₂, X₃ be i.i.d. random variables with above distribution.\n\nWe want:  \nP(X₁ + X₂ + X₃ ≡ 0 mod 10)\n\nThat is, probability that sum modulo 10 is 0.\n\nSince we only care about sum mod 10, and draws are independent, we can use **generating functions modulo x¹⁰ − 1**, or more simply, compute the distribution of sum mod 10 via convolution of mod-10 distributions.\n\nLet’s define the mod-10 value distribution of a single draw:\n\nLet a_k = P(X ≡ k mod 10), for k = 0,1,…,9.\n\nNote: values are 1 to 10.\n\nSo:\n- X = 1 → mod 10 = 1  \n- X = 2 → 2  \n- …  \n- X = 9 → 9  \n- X = 10 → 0 (since 10 ≡ 0 mod 10)\n\nSo:\n\n- P(X ≡ 0) = P(X = 10) = 4/13  \n- P(X ≡ k) = P(X = k) = 1/13, for k = 1 to 9\n\nThus the mod-10 distribution vector is:\n\na = [a₀, a₁, ..., a₉] = [4/13, 1/13, 1/13, 1/13, 1/13, 1/13, 1/13, 1/13, 1/13, 1/13]\n\nThat is: a₀ = 4/13, a₁ through a₉ = 1/13 each.\n\nNow, for three independent draws, the mod-10 sum distribution is the 3-fold cyclic convolution of a with itself.\n\nLet b = a ∗ a ∗ a (mod 10), and we want b₀.\n\nWe can compute this using discrete Fourier transform (DFT) over ℤ₁₀, but perhaps easier: use generating function.\n\nLet f(x) = Σ_{k=0}^9 a_k x^k = (4/13) + (1/13)(x + x² + ... + x⁹)\n\nNote: x¹⁰ = 1 in cyclotomic sense; we’ll evaluate f(x)^3 and extract coefficient of x⁰ mod x¹⁰ − 1.\n\nBut maybe even simpler: use roots of unity filter.\n\nRecall: For any distribution, probability that sum ≡ 0 mod m is:\n\nP(S ≡ 0 mod m) = (1/m) Σ_{j=0}^{m−1} [f(ω^j)]³,\n\nwhere ω = e^(2πi/m), a primitive m-th root of unity.\n\nHere m = 10.\n\nSo:\n\nP = (1/10) Σ_{j=0}^9 [f(ω^j)]³,\n\nwhere ω = e^(2πi/10) = e^(πi/5).\n\nLet’s compute f(ω^j) = (4/13) + (1/13) Σ_{k=1}^9 ω^{jk}\n\nNote: Σ_{k=0}^9 ω^{jk} = 0 for j not divisible by 10, and = 10 when j ≡ 0 mod 10.\n\nSo Σ_{k=1}^9 ω^{jk} = [Σ_{k=0}^9 ω^{jk}] − ω^{j·0} − ω^{j·10}? Wait no: k runs 0 to 9 gives full sum.\n\nBut our sum is k = 1 to 9, so:\n\nΣ_{k=1}^9 ω^{jk} = [Σ_{k=0}^9 ω^{jk}] − 1 − ω^{j·10}? No: ω^{j·10} = (ω^{10})^j = 1^j = 1, but k=10 is not included. Our k only goes 1 to 9, so it's full sum minus k=0 term (which is 1) and k=10 is not in range anyway.\n\nSo Σ_{k=1}^9 ω^{jk} = [Σ_{k=0}^9 ω^{jk}] − 1.\n\nAnd Σ_{k=0}^9 ω^{jk} = \n- 10 if j ≡ 0 mod 10  \n- 0 otherwise.\n\nSo:\n\n- If j = 0: ω^0 = 1, so Σ_{k=1}^9 1 = 9 ⇒ f(1) = (4/13) + (1/13)(9) = 13/13 = 1\n\n- If j = 1,2,...,9: Σ_{k=1}^9 ω^{jk} = 0 − 1 = −1 ⇒ f(ω^j) = (4/13) + (1/13)(−1) = 3/13\n\nWait: is that right?\n\nΣ_{k=0}^9 ω^{jk} = 0 for j = 1,…,9 ⇒ Σ_{k=1}^9 ω^{jk} = −ω^{j·0} = −1? Yes! Because sum from k=0 to 9 is 0 ⇒ sum_{k=1}^9 = −ω^0 = −1.\n\nSo yes: for j = 1 to 9, f(ω^j) = 4/13 − 1/13 = 3/13.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- f(ω⁰) = 1  \n- f(ω^j) = 3/13 for j = 1,…,9\n\nThen:\n\nP = (1/10)[ (1)³ + 9 × (3/13)³ ] = (1/10)[ 1 + 9 × 27 / 2197 ] = (1/10)[ 1 + 243 / 2197 ]\n\nCompute:\n\n1 = 2197/2197, so sum = (2197 + 243)/2197 = 2440 / 2197\n\nThen P = (1/10) × (2440 / 2197) = 2440 / (10 × 2197) = 244 / 2197\n\nSimplify 244 / 2197.\n\nCheck gcd(244, 2197).\n\n244 = 2² × 61  \n2197 = 13³ = 13×13×13 = 2197  \n13 and 61 are both primes, distinct. So gcd = 1.\n\nSo probability = 244 / 2197, reduced.\n\nNow the problem says:\n\n> The probability [...] can be written as m/n, where gcd(m,n)=1. Find 100m + n.  \n> Instead of computing a hundred times the numerator plus the denominator [...] simply find k = d + 0, where d is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that probability fraction.\n\nWait — reread carefully.\n\n> Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing a hundred times the numerator plus the denominator of the fraction representing the probability in lowest terms, simply find $k = d + 0$, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that probability fraction.\n\nThis is confusingly worded. It says \"Instead of computing 100m + n, simply find k = d + 0\", where d = gcd(m,n). Since gcd(m,n) = 1 always in lowest terms, then k = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBut that seems too trivial — maybe it's a trick? Let's read again.\n\nOriginal:\n\n> The probability that the sum of the point values of the cards drawn is a multiple of 10 can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing a hundred times the numerator plus the denominator of the fraction representing the probability in lowest terms, simply find $k = d + 0$, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that probability fraction.\n\nAh! It says: *“Instead of computing 100m + n, simply find k = d + 0”*, i.e., they are telling us **not** to compute 100m + n, but rather just output d, since k = d + 0 = d.\n\nAnd d = gcd(m,n) = 1, because m/n is in lowest terms.\n\nSo answer to Problem 1 is **1**.\n\nBut let’s double-check our probability computation, because if we made a mistake and the fraction isn’t reduced, then d might not be 1 — but the problem states “can be written as m/n where gcd(m,n)=1”, so by definition d = 1.\n\nHence answer_1 = 1.\n\nBut wait — is our probability correct?\n\nLet me verify with alternate method: compute total number of equally likely outcomes.\n\nSince draws are with replacement, each draw has 52 options → total outcomes = 52³.\n\nWe can compute number of ordered triples (c₁,c₂,c₃) such that sum of values ≡ 0 mod 10.\n\nEach card has value v ∈ {1,…,10} with multiplicities:\n\n- v=1 to 9: 4 cards each  \n- v=10: 16 cards\n\nSo number of ways to get values (v₁,v₂,v₃) is:  \nprod_{i=1}^3 w(v_i), where w(v) = 4 if v=1..9, 16 if v=10.\n\nSo total favorable = Σ_{v₁,v₂,v₃ ∈ {1..10}, v₁+v₂+v₃ ≡ 0 mod 10} w(v₁) w(v₂) w(v₃)\n\nLet’s define weight vector: for v=1..9: w_v = 4; w_{10} = 16.\n\nLet’s define mod-10 weights: as before, w₀ = w_{10} = 16 (since 10 ≡ 0), w_k = 4 for k = 1..9.\n\nSo same as before, but now counting, not probability.\n\nSo total favorable = Σ_{a+b+c ≡ 0 mod 10} w_a w_b w_c, where indices a,b,c ∈ {0..9}, w₀ = 16, w₁..w₉ = 4.\n\nTotal outcomes = 52³ = (4×13)³ = 64 × 2197 = let's not compute yet.\n\nFavorable = ?\n\nUse same roots of unity filter:\n\nLet g(x) = Σ_{k=0}^9 w_k x^k = 16 + 4(x + x² + ... + x⁹) = 16 + 4·(x + ... + x⁹)\n\nAs before, Σ_{k=1}^9 x^k = (x − x^{10})/(1 − x), but for roots of unity, same logic.\n\nAt x = 1: g(1) = 16 + 4×9 = 16 + 36 = 52\n\nAt x = ω^j, j = 1..9: Σ_{k=1}^9 ω^{jk} = −1 ⇒ g(ω^j) = 16 + 4·(−1) = 12\n\nSo favorable = (1/10) Σ_{j=0}^9 [g(ω^j)]³ = (1/10)[52³ + 9·12³]\n\nCompute:\n\n52³ = (50+2)³ = 125000 + 3·2500·2 + 3·50·4 + 8 = wait better: 52² = 2704, ×52 = 2704×50 + 2704×2 = 135200 + 5408 = 140608\n\nCheck: 52×52 = 2704, 2704×52:\n\n2704 × 50 = 135200  \n2704 × 2 = 5408  \nSum = 140608 ✅\n\n12³ = 1728  \n9×1728 = 15552\n\nSo sum = 140608 + 15552 = 156160\n\nDivide by 10: 15616\n\nSo favorable = 15616\n\nTotal outcomes = 52³ = 140608\n\nSo probability = 15616 / 140608\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16? Let's see.\n\n15616 ÷ 16 = 976  \n140608 ÷ 16 = 8788\n\nAgain ÷ 4: 976 ÷ 4 = 244, 8788 ÷ 4 = 2197\n\nSo 244 / 2197 — matches earlier result.\n\nAnd gcd(244,2197)=1 as established.\n\nSo yes, reduced fraction is 244/2197, so gcd = 1.\n\nHence answer_1 = 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\nGiven:  \nP(x) is a polynomial such that P(1) = 1, and for all real x where defined:\n\n$$\n\\frac{P(2x)}{P(x+1)} = 8 - \\frac{56}{x+7}\n$$\n\nWe are to find P(−1).\n\nFirst, simplify RHS:\n\n$$\n8 - \\frac{56}{x+7} = \\frac{8(x+7) - 56}{x+7} = \\frac{8x + 56 - 56}{x+7} = \\frac{8x}{x+7}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\frac{P(2x)}{P(x+1)} = \\frac{8x}{x+7}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\nP(2x) = P(x+1) \\cdot \\frac{8x}{x+7}\n$$\n\nSince P is a polynomial, RHS must be a polynomial in x. So (x+7) must divide P(x+1) × 8x.\n\nBut 8x and x+7 are coprime (no common factor), so x+7 must divide P(x+1).\n\nLet’s set y = x + 1 ⇒ x = y − 1\n\nThen x + 7 = y + 6\n\nSo P(x+1) = P(y), and condition becomes:\n\nP(2x) = P(y) · 8x / (x+7) = P(y) · 8(y−1) / (y+6)\n\nSo:\n\nP(2(y−1)) = P(y) · 8(y−1)/(y+6)\n\ni.e.,\n\nP(2y − 2) = P(y) · \\frac{8(y−1)}{y+6}\n\nSince LHS is polynomial in y, RHS must be polynomial ⇒ (y+6) divides P(y)·(y−1). Since y+6 and y−1 are coprime, y+6 must divide P(y).\n\nSo P(y) is divisible by (y + 6). So (x + 6) is a factor of P(x).\n\nSimilarly, perhaps other factors.\n\nAssume P is a polynomial of degree d.\n\nLook at degrees in functional equation:\n\ndeg(P(2x)) = deg(P) = d  \ndeg(P(x+1)) = d  \nRHS: 8x/(x+7) is rational, but overall RHS of original equation is rational function of degree 0 (numerator and denominator degree 1), so for ratio to be rational function of degree 0, degrees match — fine.\n\nBut for P(2x)/P(x+1) to equal 8x/(x+7), which has a zero at x = 0 and pole at x = −7.\n\nSo:\n\n- P(2x) has a zero when x = 0 ⇒ P(0) = 0  \n- P(x+1) has a zero when x = −7 ⇒ P(−6) = 0\n\nAlso, pole at x = −7 comes from denominator, so P(x+1) must vanish at x = −7 ⇒ P(−6) = 0 — already noted.\n\nZero at x = 0 in RHS means numerator zero and denominator nonzero there ⇒ P(2·0) = P(0) = 0, and P(0+1) = P(1) ≠ 0 — indeed P(1) = 1 ≠ 0, good.\n\nSo far, we have:\n\n- P(0) = 0 ⇒ x is a factor  \n- P(−6) = 0 ⇒ (x + 6) is a factor\n\nAlso, check behavior at other points.\n\nSuppose P(x) = c x (x + 6) Q(x), where Q is polynomial.\n\nLet’s try low-degree assumption.\n\nTry deg P = 2: P(x) = ax² + bx + c\n\nWe know:\n\n- P(1) = a + b + c = 1  \n- P(0) = c = 0 ⇒ c = 0  \n- P(−6) = a·36 − 6b + c = 36a − 6b = 0 ⇒ 6a − b = 0 ⇒ b = 6a\n\nThen P(x) = ax² + 6a x = a x (x + 6)\n\nThen P(1) = a·1·7 = 7a = 1 ⇒ a = 1/7\n\nSo P(x) = (1/7) x (x + 6)\n\nCheck if this satisfies the functional equation.\n\nCompute LHS: P(2x)/P(x+1)\n\nP(2x) = (1/7)(2x)(2x + 6) = (1/7)(2x)(2)(x + 3) = (4x/7)(x + 3)\n\nWait: 2x + 6 = 2(x + 3), so P(2x) = (1/7)(2x)(2x + 6) = (1/7)(2x)(2)(x + 3) = (4x/7)(x + 3)\n\nP(x+1) = (1/7)(x+1)(x+1 + 6) = (1/7)(x+1)(x+7)\n\nSo ratio = [4x(x + 3)/7] / [(x+1)(x+7)/7] = 4x(x + 3) / [(x+1)(x+7)]\n\nBut RHS is 8x/(x+7)\n\nSo is 4x(x + 3)/[(x+1)(x+7)] = 8x/(x+7)? Cancel x and (x+7):\n\nLeft: 4(x + 3)/(x + 1), Right: 8\n\nSo 4(x + 3)/(x + 1) = 8 ⇒ (x + 3)/(x + 1) = 2 ⇒ x + 3 = 2x + 2 ⇒ x = 1 — only true at x = 1, not identity. So degree 2 fails.\n\nTry degree 3.\n\nAssume P(x) = k x (x + 6)(x − a), introduce another root.\n\nWe know P(1) = 1.\n\nAlso, from functional equation, maybe more constraints.\n\nFrom:\n\nP(2x) / P(x+1) = 8x / (x + 7)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nP(2x) (x + 7) = 8x P(x + 1)\n\nThis is a polynomial identity (both sides polynomials), valid for all x (since denominators canceled; original undefined at x = −7, but polynomial identity holds everywhere by continuity or clearing denominators).\n\nSo:\n\nP(2x)(x + 7) − 8x P(x + 1) = 0 identically.\n\nThis is a functional equation we can use to find degree and coefficients.\n\nLet deg P = d.\n\nThen LHS: deg(P(2x)(x + 7)) = d + 1  \ndeg(8x P(x + 1)) = 1 + d  \nSo degrees match.\n\nLeading coefficients:\n\nLet P(x) = a x^d + lower.\n\nThen P(2x) = a (2x)^d + ... = a 2^d x^d + ...\n\nSo P(2x)(x + 7) has leading term a 2^d x^{d+1}\n\n8x P(x + 1): P(x + 1) = a (x + 1)^d = a x^d + ... , so 8x P(x + 1) has leading term 8a x^{d+1}\n\nSet equal: a 2^d = 8a ⇒ if a ≠ 0, 2^d = 8 = 2³ ⇒ d = 3\n\nSo degree of P is 3.\n\nGreat! So P is cubic.\n\nWe already know roots at x = 0 and x = −6, so P(x) = k x (x + 6)(x − r) for some r.\n\nSo three roots: 0, −6, r.\n\nNow use functional equation to find r and k.\n\nWe also know P(1) = 1.\n\nSo P(1) = k·1·7·(1 − r) = 7k(1 − r) = 1 ⇒ k = 1 / [7(1 − r)]\n\nNow use the identity:\n\nP(2x)(x + 7) = 8x P(x + 1)\n\nCompute both sides symbolically.\n\nLet P(x) = k x (x + 6)(x − r)\n\nThen:\n\nP(2x) = k (2x) (2x + 6) (2x − r) = k·2x·2(x + 3)·(2x − r) = 4k x (x + 3)(2x − r)\n\nSo P(2x)(x + 7) = 4k x (x + 3)(2x − r)(x + 7)\n\nRHS: 8x P(x + 1) = 8x · k (x + 1)(x + 1 + 6)(x + 1 − r) = 8k x (x + 1)(x + 7)(x + 1 − r)\n\nCancel x (valid as polynomial identity, and both sides have factor x — indeed P has root at 0, so OK), and cancel (x + 7) — does P(x+1) have factor (x + 7)? Yes, when x = −7, x + 1 = −6, and we know P(−6) = 0, so yes, (x + 7) is factor of P(x + 1), as expected.\n\nSo after canceling x and (x + 7) (both sides have them), we get:\n\nLHS: 4k (x + 3)(2x − r)  \nRHS: 8k (x + 1)(x + 1 − r)\n\nCancel k (assuming k ≠ 0, which it isn't):\n\n4 (x + 3)(2x − r) = 8 (x + 1)(x + 1 − r)\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n(x + 3)(2x − r) = 2 (x + 1)(x + 1 − r)\n\nExpand both sides.\n\nLHS: (x + 3)(2x − r) = x·2x + x·(−r) + 3·2x + 3·(−r) = 2x² − r x + 6x − 3r = 2x² + (6 − r)x − 3r\n\nRHS: 2(x + 1)(x + 1 − r) = 2[ (x + 1)(x + (1 − r)) ] = 2[ x² + x(1 − r) + x + (1 − r) ] = 2[ x² + x(2 − r) + (1 − r) ] = 2x² + 2(2 − r)x + 2(1 − r) = 2x² + (4 − 2r)x + (2 − 2r)\n\nSet equal:\n\n2x² + (6 − r)x − 3r = 2x² + (4 − 2r)x + (2 − 2r)\n\nSubtract 2x² both sides:\n\n(6 − r)x − 3r = (4 − 2r)x + (2 − 2r)\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\nx term: 6 − r = 4 − 2r ⇒ 6 − r − 4 + 2r = 0 ⇒ 2 + r = 0 ⇒ r = −2\n\nConstant term: −3r = 2 − 2r ⇒ −3r + 2r = 2 ⇒ −r = 2 ⇒ r = −2 ✅ consistent.\n\nSo r = −2.\n\nThus roots are x = 0, x = −6, x = −2.\n\nSo P(x) = k x (x + 2)(x + 6)\n\nNow use P(1) = 1:\n\nP(1) = k·1·3·7 = 21k = 1 ⇒ k = 1/21\n\nSo P(x) = (1/21) x (x + 2)(x + 6)\n\nNow find P(−1):\n\nP(−1) = (1/21)(−1)(−1 + 2)(−1 + 6) = (1/21)(−1)(1)(5) = −5/21\n\nSo answer_2 = −5/21\n\nBut let's verify quickly with functional equation.\n\nP(x) = (1/21) x (x + 2)(x + 6)\n\nCompute P(2x) = (1/21)(2x)(2x + 2)(2x + 6) = (1/21)(2x)·2(x + 1)·2(x + 3) = (1/21)·8x(x + 1)(x + 3)\n\nP(x + 1) = (1/21)(x + 1)(x + 1 + 2)(x + 1 + 6) = (1/21)(x + 1)(x + 3)(x + 7)\n\nSo ratio P(2x)/P(x + 1) = [8x(x + 1)(x + 3)/21] / [(x + 1)(x + 3)(x + 7)/21] = 8x / (x + 7) ✅ matches.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo P(−1) = −5/21\n\nAnswer is −5/21.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n- Problem 1: 1  \n- Problem 2: -5/21\n\nNow format JSON.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability that the sum of three card values (with replacement) is divisible by 10 is 244/2197, which is in lowest terms, so gcd(numerator, denominator) = 1.
