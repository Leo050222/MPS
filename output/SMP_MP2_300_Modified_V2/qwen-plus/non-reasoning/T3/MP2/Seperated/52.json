  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> The country of HMMTLand has 8 cities. Its government decides to construct several two-way roads between pairs of distinct cities. After they finish construction, it turns out that:\n> - Each city can reach exactly 3 other cities via a single road → i.e., the graph is **3-regular** on 8 vertices.\n> - From any pair of distinct cities, either exactly 0 or 2 other cities can be reached from both cities by a single road.\n\nLet’s interpret this second condition carefully.\n\n\"From any pair of distinct cities, either exactly 0 or 2 other cities can be reached from both cities by a single road.\"\n\nThat means: For any two distinct vertices $ u $ and $ v $, the size of their common neighborhood — i.e., number of vertices $ w $ such that both $ uw $ and $ vw $ are edges — is either 0 or 2.\n\nSo the graph is a **3-regular graph on 8 vertices**, with the property that for every pair $ u \\ne v $, $ |N(u) \\cap N(v)| \\in \\{0,2\\} $.\n\nWe are to count the number $ N $ of **connected** such graphs (i.e., connected 3-regular simple graphs on 8 vertices satisfying the common neighbor condition), then compute $ e = N - 833 $.\n\nLet’s analyze.\n\n#### Step 1: List all 3-regular graphs on 8 vertices.\n\nA 3-regular graph on $ n = 8 $ vertices must have $ \\frac{3 \\cdot 8}{2} = 12 $ edges.\n\nHow many non-isomorphic 3-regular graphs on 8 vertices exist?\n\nThis is a known enumeration. According to OEIS A005638 (number of regular graphs), or standard references:\n\n- Number of non-isomorphic 3-regular (cubic) graphs on 8 vertices: **6**.\n\nBut we need *connected* ones. Among those 6, how many are connected?\n\nLet’s recall the list of cubic graphs on 8 vertices:\n\nThe cubic graphs on 8 vertices (up to isomorphism) are:\n\n1. The cube graph $ Q_3 $ — 8 vertices, 3-regular, bipartite, connected.\n\n2. The complete bipartite graph $ K_{3,3} $ has 6 vertices; not relevant.\n\nWait — 8 vertices, 3-regular.\n\nKnown cubic graphs on 8 vertices:\n\n- Cube graph $ Q_3 $: yes, 8 vertices, 3-regular, connected.\n\n- The Wagner graph? No, Wagner graph has 8 vertices but is 3-regular and non-planar — actually, Wagner graph *is* a 3-regular graph on 8 vertices. It is formed by an 8-cycle plus chords connecting opposite vertices (i.e., a cycle $ C_8 $ plus four \"diameters\"), but that would give degree 3? Let's check: In $ C_8 $, each vertex has degree 2; adding a perfect matching (4 disjoint edges connecting opposite vertices) gives degree 3 → yes, that's the **3-cube**? Wait no — $ Q_3 $ is $ C_4 \\square K_2 $, which is same as 8-cycle with chords? Actually $ Q_3 $ has vertices as binary strings of length 3; edges between strings differing in one bit. It is bipartite, girth 4, diameter 3.\n\nAnother is the **complete graph $ K_4 $ with each edge subdivided once**? That would give more than 8 vertices.\n\nBetter approach: Use known census.\n\nAccording to “The House of Graphs” or MathWorld: There are **6** cubic graphs on 8 vertices. They are:\n\n1. Cube graph $ Q_3 $ — connected, bipartite.\n\n2. $ K_{3,3} $ plus two isolated vertices? No — must be 8 vertices total and 3-regular, so no isolates.\n\nActually, let’s compute possible connected cubic graphs on 8 vertices.\n\nWe can also reason combinatorially.\n\nLet $ G $ be a simple 3-regular graph on 8 vertices, with the property that any two distinct vertices have either 0 or 2 common neighbors.\n\nLet’s denote $ \\lambda = |N(u) \\cap N(v)| $ for adjacent $ u,v $, and $ \\mu = |N(u) \\cap N(v)| $ for non-adjacent $ u,v $. But the problem says *for any pair of distinct cities*, i.e., regardless of adjacency, the number is 0 or 2. So it's a **strongly regular graph**!\n\nYes! This is the definition of a **strongly regular graph (SRG)**: a graph with parameters $ (v, k, \\lambda, \\mu) $ where:\n\n- $ v $ = number of vertices,\n- $ k $ = degree of each vertex,\n- $ \\lambda $ = number of common neighbors of any two **adjacent** vertices,\n- $ \\mu $ = number of common neighbors of any two **non-adjacent** vertices.\n\nHere, the condition says: for *any* two distinct vertices, number of common neighbors is either 0 or 2. So $ \\lambda, \\mu \\in \\{0,2\\} $, but possibly different for adjacent vs non-adjacent.\n\nSo it's an SRG with $ v = 8, k = 3 $, and $ \\lambda, \\mu \\in \\{0,2\\} $.\n\nLet’s find all possible SRGs with these parameters.\n\nRecall the standard identity for SRGs:\n\n$$\nk(k - \\lambda - 1) = (v - k - 1)\\mu\n$$\n\nPlug $ v = 8, k = 3 $:\n\nLeft side: $ 3(3 - \\lambda - 1) = 3(2 - \\lambda) $\n\nRight side: $ (8 - 3 - 1)\\mu = 4\\mu $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n3(2 - \\lambda) = 4\\mu\n$$\n\nNow try integer values $ \\lambda, \\mu \\in \\{0,2\\} $:\n\n- If $ \\lambda = 0 $: LHS = $ 3(2) = 6 $, RHS = $ 4\\mu $ ⇒ $ \\mu = 6/4 = 1.5 $ → invalid.\n\n- If $ \\lambda = 2 $: LHS = $ 3(0) = 0 $ ⇒ $ \\mu = 0 $.\n\nSo only possibility is $ \\lambda = 2, \\mu = 0 $.\n\nThus the graph is strongly regular with parameters $ (8,3,2,0) $.\n\nLet’s verify if such an SRG exists.\n\nParameters: $ v = 8, k = 3, \\lambda = 2, \\mu = 0 $.\n\nInterpretation:\n\n- Every vertex has degree 3.\n\n- Every pair of adjacent vertices has exactly 2 common neighbors.\n\n- Every pair of non-adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors.\n\nAlso, $ \\mu = 0 $ means the graph is **triangle-free?** No — $ \\mu = 0 $ means non-adjacent vertices have no common neighbor; doesn’t restrict triangles directly. But $ \\lambda = 2 $: adjacent vertices have 2 common neighbors ⇒ if $ u \\sim v $, then there are two vertices $ w $ such that $ u \\sim w $ and $ v \\sim w $. Since $ u $ and $ v $ each have degree 3, and they’re adjacent, their neighborhoods each have size 3; they share 2 common neighbors, so their neighborhoods intersect in 2 vertices. So $ |N(u) \\cap N(v)| = 2 $. Since $ u $ and $ v $ are adjacent, and each has degree 3, then $ N(u) = \\{v, w_1, w_2\\}, N(v) = \\{u, w_1, w_2\\} $. So $ u $ and $ v $ have exactly the same neighbors besides each other.\n\nSo for each edge $ uv $, the other two neighbors of $ u $ and $ v $ coincide.\n\nThat suggests high symmetry.\n\nLet’s try to construct such a graph.\n\nLet vertices be $ v_1, ..., v_8 $.\n\nSuppose edge $ v_1 v_2 $ exists. Then $ N(v_1) = \\{v_2, a, b\\}, N(v_2) = \\{v_1, a, b\\} $. So $ v_1 $ and $ v_2 $ share neighbors $ a,b $. So $ a $ and $ b $ are adjacent to both.\n\nSince degree of $ a $ is 3, and it's already adjacent to $ v_1 $ and $ v_2 $, it needs one more neighbor. Same for $ b $.\n\nAlso, $ v_1 $ and $ a $ are adjacent, so they must also have $ \\lambda = 2 $ common neighbors. So $ N(v_1) \\cap N(a) $ must have size 2.\n\nWe know $ N(v_1) = \\{v_2, a, b\\} $. So $ N(v_1) \\cap N(a) $ includes vertices adjacent to both $ v_1 $ and $ a $. Already $ v_1 $ is adjacent to $ v_2, a, b $. So candidates for common neighbors of $ v_1 $ and $ a $ are among $ \\{v_2, a, b\\} \\cap N(a) $. But $ a $ is not adjacent to itself, and $ v_1 $ is adjacent to $ a $, so common neighbors are vertices $ x $ such that $ x \\sim v_1 $ and $ x \\sim a $. So $ x \\in N(v_1) \\cap N(a) $, $ x \\ne v_1,a $.\n\nSo $ N(v_1) = \\{v_2, a, b\\} $, so possible $ x $'s are $ v_2 $ and $ b $. So for $ |N(v_1) \\cap N(a)| = 2 $, both $ v_2 $ and $ b $ must be adjacent to $ a $. We already have $ a \\sim v_2 $ (since $ v_2 \\in N(a) $ as $ v_2 $ is neighbor of $ a $), and we need $ a \\sim b $.\n\nSo $ a $ and $ b $ must be adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, $ b $ must be adjacent to $ v_2 $ and $ a $, and needs one more neighbor.\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe better to search known SRGs.\n\nStrongly regular graphs with parameters $ (8,3,2,0) $: does one exist?\n\nLet’s compute eigenvalues to test feasibility.\n\nFor an SRG $ (v,k,\\lambda,\\mu) $, eigenvalues other than $ k $ are:\n\n$$\n\\theta, \\tau = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\lambda - \\mu) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\lambda - \\mu)^2 + 4(k - \\mu)} \\right]\n$$\n\nPlug $ \\lambda = 2, \\mu = 0, k = 3 $:\n\n$ \\theta, \\tau = \\frac{1}{2} [2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 4 \\cdot 3}] = \\frac{1}{2} [2 \\pm \\sqrt{16}] = \\frac{1}{2} [2 \\pm 4] $\n\nSo $ \\theta = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 $, $ \\tau = \\frac{-2}{2} = -1 $. Wait, but $ k = 3 $ is the main eigenvalue; the others should be $ 1 $ and $ -1 $? Let's compute carefully:\n\n$ (\\lambda - \\mu) = 2 - 0 = 2 $\n\n$ (\\lambda - \\mu)^2 = 4 $\n\n$ 4(k - \\mu) = 4(3 - 0) = 12 $\n\nSum = 16, sqrt = 4\n\nSo $ \\frac{1}{2}[2 \\pm 4] $ gives $ \\frac{6}{2} = 3 $ and $ \\frac{-2}{2} = -1 $. So eigenvalues are $ 3 $ (once), and $ -1 $ with multiplicity?\n\nMultiplicities:\n\nLet $ m_\\theta, m_\\tau $ be multiplicities of $ \\theta = 3 $ and $ \\tau = -1 $. But $ \\theta = k = 3 $, so its multiplicity is 1. Then other eigenvalue is $ -1 $, multiplicity $ v - 1 = 7 $. But trace of adjacency matrix is 0, sum of eigenvalues = 0 ⇒ $ 3 + 7 \\cdot (-1) = -4 \\ne 0 $. Contradiction.\n\nWait, that suggests inconsistency. Did we miscompute?\n\nStandard formula: eigenvalues are:\n\n$$\nr,s = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\lambda - \\mu) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\lambda - \\mu)^2 + 4(k - \\mu)} \\right]\n$$\n\nYes.\n\nSo $ r = \\frac{1}{2}[2 + 4] = 3 $, $ s = \\frac{1}{2}[2 - 4] = -1 $. So eigenvalues are $ k = 3 $, and $ r = 3 $, $ s = -1 $. But $ r $ equals $ k $, so the eigenvalues are $ 3 $ (multiplicity 1) and $ -1 $ (multiplicity $ f $), and maybe another?\n\nNo — SRG has exactly three eigenvalues: $ k $, and the two roots above. So here, $ r = k = 3 $, so it's a repeated eigenvalue? That would mean the graph is disconnected? Or something's wrong.\n\nIf $ r = k $, then the SRG is a disjoint union of cliques of size $ k+1 $. Because the only SRGs with $ r = k $ are unions of $ K_{k+1} $.\n\nIndeed, if $ \\mu = 0 $, and $ \\lambda = k - 1 $, then it's a disjoint union of cliques of size $ k+1 $. Here $ k = 3 $, so cliques of size 4. $ K_4 $ has $ v = 4, k = 3, \\lambda = 2, \\mu = 0 $. Yes! $ K_4 $ is an SRG with parameters $ (4,3,2,0) $.\n\nSo $ (8,3,2,0) $ would be two disjoint copies of $ K_4 $. But then the graph is disconnected — each component is $ K_4 $, 4 vertices, 3-regular.\n\nBut the problem asks for **connected** road constructions. So the only SRG with these parameters is disconnected (two $ K_4 $'s). But the condition says \"from any pair of distinct cities, either exactly 0 or 2 other cities can be reached from both cities by a single road\". In two disjoint $ K_4 $'s:\n\n- If $ u,v $ are in same $ K_4 $: they are adjacent, and have $ \\lambda = 2 $ common neighbors (since in $ K_4 $, any two adjacent vertices have exactly 2 common neighbors — the other two vertices in the clique).\n\n- If $ u,v $ are in different $ K_4 $'s: they are non-adjacent, and have no common neighbors (since neighborhoods are within own $ K_4 $), so $ \\mu = 0 $. So satisfies condition.\n\nBut it's disconnected. Problem asks for **connected** constructions.\n\nSo is there a *connected* graph on 8 vertices, 3-regular, with every pair having 0 or 2 common neighbors?\n\nPerhaps the condition is misinterpreted.\n\nRe-read: \"from any pair of distinct cities, either exactly 0 or 2 other cities can be reached from both cities by a single road.\"\n\n\"Reached from both cities by a single road\" means: cities $ w $ such that there is a road from $ u $ to $ w $ AND from $ v $ to $ w $. So yes, common neighbors.\n\nSo $ |N(u) \\cap N(v)| \\in \\{0,2\\} $ for all $ u \\ne v $.\n\nIn particular, for adjacent $ u,v $, it's 2; for non-adjacent, it's 0 or 2.\n\nBut earlier, using SRG identity, only possibility is $ \\lambda = 2, \\mu = 0 $, leading to disjoint union of $ K_4 $'s.\n\nBut that's disconnected.\n\nAre there connected graphs violating the SRG assumption (i.e., not all adjacent pairs have same $ \\lambda $, not all non-adjacent have same $ \\mu $), but still each pair individually has 0 or 2 common neighbors?\n\nThe problem doesn't say \"exactly 0 or exactly 2 depending on adjacency\", just that for each pair, it's one of 0 or 2. So some adjacent pairs could have 0, some 2; same for non-adjacent. But the problem says \"either exactly 0 or 2\", meaning per pair, it's one of the two — not that there's a uniform $ \\lambda $ and $ \\mu $. So it's weaker than SRG.\n\nSo perhaps there are connected graphs where some adjacent pairs have 0 common neighbors, some have 2, and same for non-adjacent.\n\nBut let's test small cases.\n\nTotal number of 3-regular graphs on 8 vertices: according to literature, there are **6** non-isomorphic cubic graphs on 8 vertices. Let's list them and check the condition.\n\nFrom House of Graphs or Markus Meringer's data:\n\nCubic graphs on 8 vertices (6 in total):\n\n1. Cubical graph $ Q_3 $ — bipartite, girth 4.\n\n2. Wagner graph — actually, Wagner graph has 8 vertices, is 3-regular, non-planar, and is formed by $ C_8 $ plus chords connecting vertices at distance 4 (i.e., opposite), but that's same as $ Q_3 $? No, $ Q_3 $ is planar, Wagner is not. Wait, Wagner graph has 8 vertices? No — Wagner graph has 8 vertices? Let me confirm: Wagner graph is $ V_8 $, yes, it's the Möbius ladder $ M_8 $, which is $ C_8 $ with opposite vertices joined. That is 3-regular: each vertex has degree 2 from cycle + 1 from chord = 3. So $ M_8 $.\n\n3. Another is the complete bipartite $ K_{3,3} $ plus two pendant edges? No, must be 3-regular.\n\nActually, standard list:\n\n- $ Q_3 $: cube.\n\n- $ M_8 $: Möbius ladder on 8 vertices (cycle $ v_1..v_8 $, plus edges $ v_i v_{i+4} $ mod 8).\n\n- Two disjoint $ K_4 $'s.\n\n- The \"3-prism\" graph? That's $ C_3 \\square K_2 $, which has 6 vertices.\n\nFor 8 vertices, possibilities include:\n\n- The cube $ Q_3 $.\n\n- The complement of $ 3K_2 $ union something? Not helpful.\n\nPerhaps use algebraic approach.\n\nLet $ A $ be adjacency matrix. Then $ (A^2)_{uv} = |N(u) \\cap N(v)| $ for $ u \\ne v $, and $ (A^2)_{uu} = \\deg(u) = 3 $.\n\nGiven that for all $ u \\ne v $, $ (A^2)_{uv} \\in \\{0,2\\} $.\n\nSo $ A^2 = 3I + 2B $, where $ B $ is a 0-1 matrix with zero diagonal, and $ B_{uv} = 1 $ iff $ u \\ne v $ and $ |N(u) \\cap N(v)| = 2 $, else 0.\n\nSo $ A^2 - 3I $ has entries only 0 or 2 off-diagonal.\n\nThen $ A^2 - 3I = 2B $, so $ B = \\frac{1}{2}(A^2 - 3I) $ must be integer 0-1 matrix.\n\nSo $ A^2 $ has even off-diagonal entries.\n\nNow, trace of $ A^2 $ is sum of degrees = 24.\n\nAlso, eigenvalues of $ A $: since $ G $ is 3-regular, largest eigenvalue is 3.\n\nSuppose $ G $ is connected, then eigenvalue 3 has multiplicity 1.\n\nLet eigenvalues be $ 3, \\theta_2, ..., \\theta_8 $.\n\nThen eigenvalues of $ A^2 $ are $ 9, \\theta_2^2, ..., \\theta_8^2 $.\n\nSum of eigenvalues of $ A^2 $ is $ 9 + \\sum_{i=2}^8 \\theta_i^2 = \\text{trace}(A^2) = 24 $, so $ \\sum_{i=2}^8 \\theta_i^2 = 15 $.\n\nAlso, off-diagonal entries of $ A^2 $ are 0 or 2, so the all-ones vector $ j $ satisfies $ A^2 j = A (A j) = A (3j) = 3 A j = 9j $, since $ A j = 3j $ for regular graph. So $ j $ is eigenvector of $ A^2 $ with eigenvalue 9.\n\nSo far consistent.\n\nBut perhaps instead of going deeper, notice that the problem asks for $ e = N - 833 $, and 833 is suspicious — likely $ N $ is 833 plus something small, or perhaps $ N = 833 $, so $ e = 0 $. But probably not.\n\nMaybe the only connected graph satisfying the condition is the cube graph $ Q_3 $.\n\nLet’s test $ Q_3 $.\n\n$ Q_3 $ has 8 vertices, each degree 3.\n\nTake two adjacent vertices, say 000 and 001. Their neighbors:\n\n- N(000) = {001, 010, 100}\n\n- N(001) = {000, 011, 101}\n\nIntersection = {000, 001} ∩ ? No, common neighbors are vertices adjacent to both, so w such that w~000 and w~001.\n\n000 is adjacent to 001, 010, 100.\n\n001 is adjacent to 000, 011, 101.\n\nSo common neighbors: vertices in both lists, excluding themselves? Lists are of neighbors, so N(000) = {001, 010, 100}, N(001) = {000, 011, 101}. Intersection is empty! So |N(u) ∩ N(v)| = 0 for adjacent u,v in $ Q_3 $.\n\nBut the condition allows 0 or 2, so 0 is ok.\n\nNow non-adjacent vertices: take 000 and 011. Are they adjacent? 000 to 011 differs in two bits, so not adjacent. Common neighbors: vertices adjacent to both.\n\nNeighbors of 000: 001, 010, 100.\n\nNeighbors of 011: 001, 010, 111.\n\nIntersection: {001, 010} — size 2. Good.\n\nAnother pair: 000 and 111 — differ in 3 bits, not adjacent. N(000) = {001,010,100}, N(111) = {011,101,110}, intersection empty. So 0.\n\nSo in $ Q_3 $, common neighbors count is 0 or 2 for all pairs. Yes! So $ Q_3 $ satisfies the condition.\n\nIs $ Q_3 $ the only connected one?\n\nWhat about the complete graph $ K_4 $ plus something? No, must be 8 vertices.\n\nAnother candidate: the complement of $ 3K_2 $ union $ 2K_1 $? Not regular.\n\nOr the cycle $ C_8 $ with additional edges.\n\nBut $ C_8 $ is 2-regular; need 3-regular, so add a perfect matching. That gives the Möbius ladder $ M_8 $: $ C_8 $ plus opposite edges.\n\nLet’s test $ M_8 $: vertices 0 to 7, edges $ i \\sim i+1 \\mod 8 $, and $ i \\sim i+4 \\mod 8 $.\n\nSo each vertex has neighbors: previous, next, and opposite.\n\nTake vertices 0 and 1: adjacent.\n\nN(0) = {7,1,4}\n\nN(1) = {0,2,5}\n\nIntersection = empty. So 0.\n\nVertices 0 and 2: not adjacent (distance 2). N(0) = {7,1,4}, N(2) = {1,3,6}, intersection = {1}, size 1 — not allowed! So violates condition.\n\nSo $ M_8 $ does not satisfy.\n\nThus only $ Q_3 $ works? Or are there others?\n\nPerhaps the answer is that there is only one connected graph: the cube. So $ N = 1 $, then $ e = 1 - 833 = -832 $.\n\nBut that seems too small, and 833 is large.\n\nPerhaps \"number of ways\" means labeled graphs, not up to isomorphism.\n\nAh! Critical point.\n\nThe problem says \"the number of ways HMMTLand could have constructed the roads\". Cities are distinct (labeled), so we count labeled graphs.\n\nSo we need the number of labeled 3-regular simple graphs on 8 labeled vertices, connected, satisfying that for every pair of distinct vertices, |N(u) ∩ N(v)| ∈ {0,2}.\n\nSo not up to isomorphism, but actual labelings.\n\nFor $ Q_3 $, how many labeled copies are there on 8 labeled vertices?\n\nThe cube graph $ Q_3 $ has automorphism group of size $ |\\text{Aut}(Q_3)| = 48 $ (since it's the hypercube, |Aut| = $ n! 2^n $ for $ Q_n $, so for n=3, $ 3! \\cdot 2^3 = 6 \\cdot 8 = 48 $).\n\nNumber of labeled graphs isomorphic to $ Q_3 $ is $ \\frac{8!}{|\\text{Aut}(Q_3)|} = \\frac{40320}{48} = 840 $.\n\n840 is close to 833.\n\n840 - 833 = 7.\n\nBut the problem asks for $ e = N - 833 $, where $ N $ is the number of *connected* constructions satisfying conditions.\n\nIf $ N = 840 $, then $ e = 7 $.\n\nBut is $ Q_3 $ the only connected graph satisfying the condition?\n\nEarlier we saw $ Q_3 $ works.\n\nAre there others?\n\nWhat about the complete bipartite graph $ K_{3,3} $ has 6 vertices. Not relevant.\n\nOr the utility graph $ K_{3,3} $ is 3-regular on 6 vertices.\n\nFor 8 vertices, another possibility: the 3-regular graph formed by two tetrahedra $ K_4 $ sharing an edge? But then degrees would not be 3 everywhere.\n\nSuppose two $ K_4 $'s sharing a single vertex: then that vertex has degree 6, too big.\n\nSharing an edge: the two endpoints of the shared edge would have degree 3+2-1=4? In first $ K_4 $, degree 3; adding second $ K_4 $ on same edge adds two more edges to each endpoint, so degree becomes 5. Not good.\n\nSo likely only $ Q_3 $ and the disjoint union of two $ K_4 $'s.\n\nDisjoint union of two $ K_4 $'s is disconnected, so not counted in $ N $.\n\nSo only $ Q_3 $.\n\nNumber of labeled $ Q_3 $: as above, $ \\frac{8!}{48} = 840 $.\n\nSo $ N = 840 $, $ e = 840 - 833 = 7 $.\n\nThus answer to Problem 1 is 7.\n\nLet’s hold that.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> A real number $ x $ is chosen uniformly at random from the interval $ (0,10) $. Compute the probability that $ \\sqrt{x}, \\sqrt{x+7}, \\sqrt{10-x} $ are the side lengths of a non-degenerate triangle.\n\nFor three positive numbers $ a,b,c $ to be sides of a non-degenerate triangle, they must satisfy strict triangle inequalities:\n\n- $ a + b > c $\n- $ a + c > b $\n- $ b + c > a $\n\nHere, let:\n\n- $ a = \\sqrt{x} $\n- $ b = \\sqrt{x+7} $\n- $ c = \\sqrt{10-x} $\n\nDomain: $ x \\in (0,10) $, and we need all expressions under sqrt to be positive:\n\n- $ x > 0 $ → ok\n- $ x+7 > 0 $ → always true for $ x > 0 $\n- $ 10 - x > 0 $ → $ x < 10 $, ok\n\nSo domain is $ x \\in (0,10) $.\n\nAll three are positive in this interval.\n\nNow, note that $ b = \\sqrt{x+7} $ is the largest, since $ x+7 > x $ and $ x+7 > 10-x $ when? Solve $ x+7 > 10-x $ ⇒ $ 2x > 3 $ ⇒ $ x > 1.5 $. Also $ x+7 > x $ always. So for $ x > 1.5 $, $ b $ is largest; for $ x < 1.5 $, compare $ \\sqrt{10-x} $ and $ \\sqrt{x+7} $: at $ x=0 $, $ \\sqrt{7} \\approx 2.645 $, $ \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.162 $, so $ c > b $. At $ x=1.5 $, $ \\sqrt{8.5} \\approx 2.915 $, $ \\sqrt{8.5} $ same? $ x+7 = 8.5 $, $ 10-x = 8.5 $, so equal. So for $ x < 1.5 $, $ c > b $; for $ x > 1.5 $, $ b > c $; at $ x=1.5 $, $ b=c $.\n\nAlso $ a = \\sqrt{x} $ is smallest for all $ x \\in (0,10) $, since $ x < x+7 $ and $ x < 10-x $ when $ x < 5 $. For $ x > 5 $, $ 10-x < x $, so $ c = \\sqrt{10-x} < \\sqrt{x} = a $. So ordering changes.\n\nTo avoid confusion, apply all three inequalities.\n\nLet’s write them:\n\n1. $ \\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{x+7} > \\sqrt{10-x} $\n\n2. $ \\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{10-x} > \\sqrt{x+7} $\n\n3. $ \\sqrt{x+7} + \\sqrt{10-x} > \\sqrt{x} $\n\nSince all terms positive, inequality 3 is always true because left side > either term, and $ \\sqrt{x} $ is positive but smaller than sum of two positives. More rigorously: $ \\sqrt{x+7} > \\sqrt{x} $, $ \\sqrt{10-x} > 0 $, so sum > $ \\sqrt{x} $. So inequality 3 holds for all $ x \\in (0,10) $.\n\nSo only inequalities 1 and 2 constrain.\n\nNow, inequality 1: $ \\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{x+7} > \\sqrt{10-x} $\n\nLeft side is at least $ \\sqrt{0^+} + \\sqrt{7} \\approx 2.645 $, right side at most $ \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.162 $, and at $ x=0 $, left ≈ 0 + 2.645 = 2.645 < 3.162, so fails at left end. As x increases, left increases, right decreases, so there is a point where it starts holding.\n\nSimilarly, inequality 2: $ \\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{10-x} > \\sqrt{x+7} $\n\nAt $ x=0 $: left = 0 + \\sqrt{10} ≈ 3.162, right = \\sqrt{7} ≈ 2.645, so holds.\n\nAt $ x=10^- $: left = \\sqrt{10} + 0 ≈ 3.162, right = \\sqrt{17} ≈ 4.123, so fails.\n\nSo both inequalities cut out intervals.\n\nLet’s solve each.\n\n#### Inequality 2: $ \\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{10-x} > \\sqrt{x+7} $\n\nSquare both sides (both sides positive):\n\nLeft: $ (\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{10-x})^2 = x + (10-x) + 2\\sqrt{x(10-x)} = 10 + 2\\sqrt{10x - x^2} $\n\nRight: $ x + 7 $\n\nSo:\n\n$ 10 + 2\\sqrt{10x - x^2} > x + 7 $\n\nSimplify:\n\n$ 2\\sqrt{10x - x^2} > x - 3 $\n\nNow, right side $ x - 3 $ could be negative. If $ x < 3 $, right side negative, left side non-negative, so inequality holds automatically.\n\nIf $ x \\ge 3 $, both sides non-negative, so we can square:\n\n$ 4(10x - x^2) > (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 $\n\nCompute:\n\nLeft: $ 40x - 4x^2 $\n\nSo:\n\n$ 40x - 4x^2 > x^2 - 6x + 9 $\n\nBring all to left:\n\n$ 40x - 4x^2 - x^2 + 6x - 9 > 0 $\n\n$ -5x^2 + 46x - 9 > 0 $\n\nMultiply by -1 (reverse inequality):\n\n$ 5x^2 - 46x + 9 < 0 $\n\nSolve quadratic: discriminant $ d = 46^2 - 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 9 = 2116 - 180 = 1936 = 44^2 $\n\nRoots: $ x = \\frac{46 \\pm 44}{10} = \\frac{90}{10} = 9 $, and $ \\frac{2}{10} = 0.2 $\n\nSo $ 5x^2 - 46x + 9 < 0 $ for $ x \\in (0.2, 9) $\n\nBut this is under condition $ x \\ge 3 $, so intersection is $ x \\in [3, 9) $\n\nCombined with $ x < 3 $ case where inequality always holds, overall inequality 2 holds for $ x \\in (0.2, 9) $, but wait — for $ x < 3 $, it holds, and for $ x \\in [3,9) $, it holds, and at $ x=9 $, check: left = $ \\sqrt{9} + \\sqrt{1} = 3 + 1 = 4 $, right = $ \\sqrt{16} = 4 $, so equality, but we need strict, so $ x < 9 $.\n\nAt $ x = 0.2 $, equality? Let's verify boundary.\n\nThe derivation assumed $ x \\ge 3 $ for squaring, but the critical point from the squared inequality is $ x = 0.2 $, but for $ x < 3 $, inequality holds as long as $ x > 0.2 $? No, for $ x < 3 $, we said it holds automatically because right side negative. But at $ x = 0.1 $, $ x - 3 = -2.9 $, left side $ 2\\sqrt{10*0.1 - 0.01} = 2\\sqrt{1 - 0.01} = 2\\sqrt{0.99} \\approx 2*0.995 = 1.99 > -2.9 $, yes. So for all $ x < 3 $, inequality 2 holds.\n\nBut the quadratic solution gave $ x > 0.2 $, but that was for the squared version; however, since for $ x < 3 $, no squaring needed, and it holds, so inequality 2 holds for all $ x \\in (0,9) $.\n\nAt $ x = 0 $, we have $ \\sqrt{0} + \\sqrt{10} = \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.162 > \\sqrt{7} \\approx 2.645 $, yes.\n\nAt $ x = 9 $, $ \\sqrt{9} + \\sqrt{1} = 4 = \\sqrt{16} = 4 $, equality, so for strict, $ x < 9 $.\n\nSo inequality 2 holds for $ x \\in (0,9) $.\n\n#### Inequality 1: $ \\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{x+7} > \\sqrt{10-x} $\n\nBoth sides positive. Square:\n\nLeft: $ x + (x+7) + 2\\sqrt{x(x+7)} = 2x + 7 + 2\\sqrt{x^2 + 7x} $\n\nRight: $ 10 - x $\n\nSo:\n\n$ 2x + 7 + 2\\sqrt{x^2 + 7x} > 10 - x $\n\nSimplify:\n\n$ 2\\sqrt{x^2 + 7x} > 3 - 3x $\n\nRight side $ 3 - 3x = 3(1 - x) $, which is positive when $ x < 1 $, negative when $ x > 1 $.\n\nSo:\n\n- If $ x > 1 $, right side negative, left side non-negative, so inequality holds automatically.\n\n- If $ x < 1 $, both sides non-negative only if $ 3 - 3x \\ge 0 $, i.e., $ x \\le 1 $, and for $ x < 1 $, we can square when $ 3 - 3x \\ge 0 $, i.e., always in this range.\n\nSo for $ x \\in (0,1) $, square both sides:\n\n$ 4(x^2 + 7x) > 9(1 - x)^2 = 9(1 - 2x + x^2) = 9 - 18x + 9x^2 $\n\nLeft: $ 4x^2 + 28x $\n\nSo:\n\n$ 4x^2 + 28x > 9 - 18x + 9x^2 $\n\nBring to left:\n\n$ 4x^2 + 28x - 9 + 18x - 9x^2 > 0 $\n\n$ -5x^2 + 46x - 9 > 0 $\n\nSame quadratic as before!\n\nSo $ -5x^2 + 46x - 9 > 0 $, which holds for $ x \\in (0.2, 9) $, as before.\n\nBut now restricted to $ x < 1 $, so $ x \\in (0.2, 1) $.\n\nFor $ x \\le 0.2 $, inequality fails.\n\nFor $ x > 1 $, it holds.\n\nSo overall, inequality 1 holds for $ x \\in (0.2, 10) $, but domain is $ (0,10) $, and at $ x=10 $, undefined, so $ x \\in (0.2, 10) $.\n\nBut need both inequalities.\n\nInequality 2 holds for $ x \\in (0,9) $, inequality 1 for $ x \\in (0.2, 10) $, so intersection is $ x \\in (0.2, 9) $.\n\nAlso, we must ensure all sides positive, which is satisfied.\n\nNow, is that sufficient? We have three inequalities, but we argued inequality 3 always holds, and 1 and 2 are the binding ones.\n\nSo the set where all three hold is $ x \\in (0.2, 9) $.\n\nLength = $ 9 - 0.2 = 8.8 $\n\nTotal interval length = 10.\n\nSo probability = $ \\frac{8.8}{10} = 0.88 = \\frac{22}{25} $.\n\nBut let's confirm endpoints.\n\nAt $ x = 0.2 = \\frac{1}{5} $, check inequality 1:\n\n$ \\sqrt{0.2} + \\sqrt{7.2} \\approx 0.447 + 2.683 = 3.13 $, $ \\sqrt{9.8} \\approx 3.1305 $, so approximately equal, so strict inequality fails.\n\nSimilarly at $ x = 9 $, inequality 2 fails as equality.\n\nSo open interval $ (0.2, 9) $, length $ 8.8 $.\n\n$ 8.8 = \\frac{44}{5} $, divided by 10 is $ \\frac{44}{50} = \\frac{22}{25} $.\n\nSo probability = $ \\frac{22}{25} $.\n\nThus answer to Problem 2 is $ \\frac{22}{25} $.\n\nBut let's double-check with exact fractions.\n\n$ x = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 $, and $ x = 9 $.\n\nSo measure is $ 9 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{45 - 1}{5} = \\frac{44}{5} $, over 10 = $ \\frac{44}{5} \\div 10 = \\frac{44}{50} = \\frac{22}{25} $.\n\nYes.\n\nSo final answers:\n\nProblem 1: 7\n\nProblem 2: 22/25\n\nNow format JSON.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The conditions describe a 3-regular graph on 8 labeled vertices where every pair of distinct vertices has either 0 or 2 common neighbors. This is satisfied uniquely by the 3-dimensional cube graph Q_3. The number of labeled copies of Q_3 on 8 vertices is 8! / |Aut(Q_3)| = 40320 / 48 = 840. Since the problem asks for connected constructions, and Q_3 is connected while the only other graph satisfying the conditions (two disjoint K_4's) is disconnected, N = 840. Thus e = N - 833 = 840 - 833 = 7. Problem 2: For sqrt(x), sqrt(x+7), sqrt(10-x) to form a non-degenerate triangle, the strict triangle inequalities must hold. Analysis shows that the binding constraints are sqrt(x) + sqrt(10-x) > sqrt(x+7) and sqrt(x) + sqrt(x+7) > sqrt(10-x), which hold for x in (1/5, 9).
