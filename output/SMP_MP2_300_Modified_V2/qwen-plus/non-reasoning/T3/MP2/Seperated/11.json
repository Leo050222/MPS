  "reasoning_content": "We are given two distinct problems. Let's solve each step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> Compute the number of ways to color the vertices of a regular heptagon red, green, or blue (with rotations and reflections distinct) such that no isosceles triangle whose vertices are vertices of the heptagon has all three vertices the same color. Instead of computing the total number of such valid colorings, simply find $ m = N_1 + 1968 $, where $ N_1 $ is the number of valid colorings arising from partitioning the vertices into two disjoint scalene triangles and a singleton vertex, with each part monochromatic in a distinct color.\n\nSo we need to compute $ N_1 $: number of colorings where:\n\n- The 7 vertices of a regular heptagon are partitioned into:\n  - Two disjoint **scalene triangles**, i.e., triangles with all side lengths different (in terms of chord lengths between vertices on the circle), and\n  - One remaining vertex (a singleton).\n- Each of these three parts (two triangles + one vertex) is assigned a **distinct color** among {red, green, blue}.\n- So colors are assigned bijectively: 3! = 6 ways to assign colors to the three parts.\n- Rotations and reflections are considered **distinct**, i.e., we do **not** quotient by symmetry — so label the vertices 0 through 6 (fixed positions), and count labeled partitions.\n\nSo first, how many ways to partition the 7 labeled vertices into two disjoint 3-element subsets (triangles) and one singleton, such that **both 3-element subsets form scalene triangles** (i.e., their vertex triples induce scalene triangles in the regular heptagon), and the singleton is just the leftover vertex.\n\nAlso note: Since the heptagon is regular, triangle shape (scalene/isosceles/equilateral) depends only on the multiset of arc distances (steps mod 7) between consecutive vertices (in cyclic order). For any triple of vertices, we can sort them cyclically and consider the three arc lengths (gaps) between them modulo 7 — they sum to 7.\n\nLet’s formalize:\n\nLabel vertices $ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 $ mod 7.\n\nA triangle formed by vertices $ a,b,c $ is **isosceles** iff two of the chord lengths (Euclidean distances) are equal. In a regular $ n $-gon, chords of same length correspond to same minimal step distance (i.e., same minimal $ \\min(|i-j|, n-|i-j|) $), called the *step size*. So chord length depends only on the step size $ d \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor\\} $. For $ n = 7 $, possible step sizes are 1,2,3.\n\nSo for a triangle with vertices $ x,y,z $, compute the three pairwise step sizes (minimal distances mod 7): $ d_{xy}, d_{yz}, d_{zx} $. But note: having two equal step sizes does **not necessarily** imply isosceles triangle — because chord lengths depend only on step size, so if two step sizes are equal, then two sides have equal length → isosceles. So triangle is **scalene** iff all three pairwise minimal step distances are distinct.\n\nBut caution: For three points on a circle, the triangle is isosceles iff at least two of the three chord lengths are equal. Since chord length is determined solely by step size $ s = \\min(|i-j|, 7-|i-j|) \\in \\{1,2,3\\} $, and since $ s=1,2,3 $ give distinct chord lengths (in regular heptagon), yes — scalene triangle ↔ the three pairwise step sizes are all distinct.\n\nSo for a triple $ \\{a,b,c\\} $, compute the three unordered step sizes (i.e., the three values $ \\min(|a-b|,7-|a-b|), \\min(|b-c|,7-|b-c|), \\min(|c-a|,7-|c-a|) $), and check if they are all distinct (i.e., a permutation of {1,2,3}).\n\nNote: Since there are only 3 possible step sizes (1,2,3), and we need all three, the only way a triple yields a scalene triangle is if its three pairwise minimal distances are exactly 1, 2, and 3 in some order.\n\nSo our goal reduces to: Count the number of unordered partitions of the 7-element set into:\n\n- Two disjoint 3-element subsets $ T_1, T_2 $, both of which are scalene (i.e., each has pairwise step sizes {1,2,3}),\n- And a singleton $ \\{v\\} $.\n\nSince vertices are labeled (rotations/reflections are distinct), we count **ordered** partitions? Wait: the problem says “partitioning the vertices into two disjoint scalene triangles and a singleton vertex, with each part monochromatic in a distinct color”.\n\nSo the parts are unlabeled except for being assigned distinct colors. But since colors are assigned distinctly, and there are 3! colorings per partition into three labeled parts (triangle A, triangle B, singleton), but the two triangles are *unlabeled* in the partition — i.e., swapping $ T_1 $ and $ T_2 $ gives same partition.\n\nSo we must be careful:\n\n- First, count number of **unordered** partitions $ \\{T_1, T_2, \\{v\\}\\} $, where $ T_1, T_2 $ are 3-element subsets, disjoint, union with $ \\{v\\} $ is all 7 vertices, and both $ T_1 $ and $ T_2 $ are scalene.\n\n- Then, for each such partition, assign 3 distinct colors to the 3 parts: 3! = 6 ways.\n\n- Since the two triangles are indistinct in the partition, but colors are assigned to *parts*, and parts are distinguishable only by their vertex sets — but since $ T_1 $ and $ T_2 $ are different sets, assigning red to $ T_1 $ vs $ T_2 $ is different coloring. So actually, once the partition is fixed as a set of three parts: two 3-sets and one 1-set, then labeling the parts with colors is 3! regardless.\n\nSo yes, for each such partition (as a collection of three subsets), there are 6 colorings.\n\nThus $ N_1 = 6 \\times (\\text{number of such partitions}) $.\n\nSo now compute number of ways to choose:\n\n- A singleton $ v \\in \\{0,\\dots,6\\} $: 7 choices.\n\n- Then partition remaining 6 vertices into two unordered 3-element subsets $ T_1, T_2 $, both scalene.\n\nSo for each $ v $, count number of unordered $\\{T_1,T_2\\}$ with $ T_1 \\cup T_2 = [7]\\setminus\\{v\\} $, $ |T_1|=|T_2|=3 $, $ T_1 \\cap T_2 = \\emptyset $, and both $ T_1 $, $ T_2 $ scalene.\n\nSince total vertices are few (7), perhaps we can enumerate all 3-element subsets of a 7-element set and test which are scalene.\n\nTotal number of 3-element subsets of 7 elements: $ \\binom{7}{3} = 35 $. For each, determine if it's scalene.\n\nLet’s list all 3-element subsets up to rotation? But since labels matter, better to fix vertex set $ \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\} $, and for each 3-subset, compute the three pairwise minimal distances.\n\nLet’s define function: for a triple $ \\{a,b,c\\} $, sort them: $ x<y<z $, then compute steps:\n\n- $ d_1 = y - x $\n- $ d_2 = z - y $\n- $ d_3 = 7 - (z - x) = 7 - (z - x) = 7 - (d_1 + d_2) $\n\nBut those are the *gaps along the circle* in one direction. However, chord lengths depend on minimal distance between each pair, not gaps.\n\nBetter: for each pair, compute $ \\min(|i-j|, 7-|i-j|) $. So for triple $ \\{a,b,c\\} $, compute three values:\n\n- $ s_{ab} = \\min(|a-b|, 7-|a-b|) $\n- $ s_{bc} = \\min(|b-c|, 7-|b-c|) $\n- $ s_{ca} = \\min(|c-a|, 7-|c-a|) $\n\nEach $ s \\in \\{1,2,3\\} $. Triple is scalene iff $ \\{s_{ab}, s_{bc}, s_{ca}\\} = \\{1,2,3\\} $.\n\nLet’s find how many 3-subsets have this property.\n\nBecause of symmetry, number of scalene triples is same for any starting point; we can fix one element, say 0, and count triples containing 0, then multiply by 7 and divide by 3 (since each triple contains 3 vertices).\n\nSo count number of scalene triples containing 0.\n\nTriples containing 0: choose two others from {1,2,3,4,5,6}: $ \\binom{6}{2} = 15 $.\n\nList them:\n\n(0,1,2): pairs: |0-1|=1, |0-2|=2, |1-2|=1 → steps: 1,2,1 → multiset {1,1,2} → not scalene.\n\n(0,1,3): |0-1|=1, |0-3|=3, |1-3|=2 → {1,2,3} → ✅\n\n(0,1,4): |0-1|=1, |0-4|=4→min(4,3)=3, |1-4|=3→min(3,4)=3 → {1,3,3} → ❌\n\n(0,1,5): |0-1|=1, |0-5|=5→min(5,2)=2, |1-5|=4→min(4,3)=3 → {1,2,3} → ✅\n\n(0,1,6): |0-1|=1, |0-6|=1 (since 7-1=6, min(6,1)=1), |1-6|=5→min(5,2)=2 → {1,1,2} → ❌\n\nSo far with 0,1: scalene at (0,1,3) and (0,1,5)\n\nNow (0,2,3): |0-2|=2, |0-3|=3, |2-3|=1 → {1,2,3} → ✅\n\n(0,2,4): |0-2|=2, |0-4|=3 (min(4,3)=3), |2-4|=2 → {2,2,3} → ❌\n\n(0,2,5): |0-2|=2, |0-5|=2 (min(5,2)=2), |2-5|=3 → {2,2,3} → ❌\n\n(0,2,6): |0-2|=2, |0-6|=1, |2-6|=4→min(4,3)=3 → {1,2,3} → ✅\n\nSo (0,2,3), (0,2,6)\n\n(0,3,4): |0-3|=3, |0-4|=3, |3-4|=1 → {1,3,3} → ❌\n\n(0,3,5): |0-3|=3, |0-5|=2, |3-5|=2 → {2,2,3} → ❌\n\n(0,3,6): |0-3|=3, |0-6|=1, |3-6|=3 → {1,3,3} → ❌\n\n(0,4,5): |0-4|=3, |0-5|=2, |4-5|=1 → {1,2,3} → ✅\n\n(0,4,6): |0-4|=3, |0-6|=1, |4-6|=2 → {1,2,3} → ✅\n\n(0,5,6): |0-5|=2, |0-6|=1, |5-6|=1 → {1,1,2} → ❌\n\nLet’s tally:\n\nFrom above:\n\n- (0,1,3) ✅  \n- (0,1,5) ✅  \n- (0,2,3) ✅  \n- (0,2,6) ✅  \n- (0,4,5) ✅  \n- (0,4,6) ✅  \n\nThat’s 6.\n\nDouble-check we didn’t miss:\n\nList all 15:\n\n1. (0,1,2) ❌  \n2. (0,1,3) ✅  \n3. (0,1,4) ❌  \n4. (0,1,5) ✅  \n5. (0,1,6) ❌  \n6. (0,2,3) ✅  \n7. (0,2,4) ❌  \n8. (0,2,5) ❌  \n9. (0,2,6) ✅  \n10. (0,3,4) ❌  \n11. (0,3,5) ❌  \n12. (0,3,6) ❌  \n13. (0,4,5) ✅  \n14. (0,4,6) ✅  \n15. (0,5,6) ❌  \n\nYes, exactly 6 triples containing 0 are scalene.\n\nTherefore total number of scalene 3-subsets = $ \\frac{7 \\times 6}{3} = 14 $.\n\nBecause each scalene triple is counted 3 times (once for each vertex).\n\nSo there are 14 scalene triangles (3-vertex subsets) among the 7 vertices.\n\nNow, we need to count number of ways to choose two disjoint scalene triangles $ T_1, T_2 $, and a singleton $ v $, covering all 7 vertices.\n\nSo $ |T_1| = |T_2| = 3 $, disjoint, $ T_1 \\cup T_2 \\cup \\{v\\} = \\{0,\\dots,6\\} $.\n\nSo equivalently: choose $ v $, then partition remaining 6 vertices into two scalene triangles.\n\nSo for each $ v $, how many ways to split $ S = [7]\\setminus\\{v\\} $ (size 6) into two disjoint 3-subsets, both scalene.\n\nNote: Since the whole set has 7 elements, removing one leaves 6; number of ways to split 6 labeled elements into two unordered 3-subsets is $ \\frac{1}{2}\\binom{6}{3} = 10 $. Because choose 3 for $ T_1 $, rest is $ T_2 $, but $ \\{T_1,T_2\\} = \\{T_2,T_1\\} $, so divide by 2.\n\nSo for each $ v $, there are 10 possible unordered partitions of the remaining 6 into two 3-sets. Among those, how many have both 3-sets scalene?\n\nSo we need, for a fixed 6-element subset $ S $ (which is all vertices except $ v $), how many of the 10 bipartitions into two 3-sets consist of two scalene triples.\n\nBut scalene triples are defined on the full 7-gon; removing a vertex may affect whether a triple is scalene? No — scalene is property of the triple alone, independent of other vertices. So a triple is scalene iff its three pairwise minimal distances are {1,2,3}, regardless of $ v $. So we can precompute all scalene triples (we have 14), and for each $ v $, count number of unordered pairs $ \\{T_1,T_2\\} $ such that $ T_1 \\cap T_2 = \\emptyset $, $ T_1 \\cup T_2 = [7]\\setminus\\{v\\} $, and both $ T_1 $, $ T_2 $ are in the set of 14 scalene triples.\n\nSo let’s list all 14 scalene triples.\n\nFrom earlier, scalene triples containing 0: (0,1,3), (0,1,5), (0,2,3), (0,2,6), (0,4,5), (0,4,6)\n\nBy rotational symmetry (adding 1 mod 7 to all elements), we can generate all.\n\nLet’s apply rotation $ +k \\mod 7 $.\n\nTake base scalene triples containing 0:\n\nA = (0,1,3)  \nB = (0,1,5)  \nC = (0,2,3)  \nD = (0,2,6)  \nE = (0,4,5)  \nF = (0,4,6)\n\nNow rotate each by k = 0 to 6.\n\nBut need to avoid duplicates.\n\nSince total is 14, and we have 6 containing 0, and each triple contains 3 vertices, total incidences = 14×3 = 42, and 7 vertices × (number containing it) = 42 ⇒ each vertex is in exactly 6 scalene triples — matches our earlier count (6 per vertex).\n\nSo the 14 scalene triples are:\n\nFrom A=(0,1,3): rotations:\n\nk=0: (0,1,3)  \nk=1: (1,2,4)  \nk=2: (2,3,5)  \nk=3: (3,4,6)  \nk=4: (4,5,0) = (0,4,5) — but that’s E! So overlap.\n\nIndeed, (0,4,5) is rotation of (0,1,3) by +4? 0+4=4, 1+4=5, 3+4=7≡0 → yes, (4,5,0). So E is rotation of A.\n\nSimilarly, check B=(0,1,5):  \nk=0: (0,1,5)  \nk=1: (1,2,6)  \nk=2: (2,3,0) = (0,2,3) = C  \nk=3: (3,4,1) = (1,3,4)  \nk=4: (4,5,2) = (2,4,5)  \nk=5: (5,6,3) = (3,5,6)  \nk=6: (6,0,4) = (0,4,6) = F\n\nSo B generates F, C, etc.\n\nThus the 14 are covered by two orbits? Let's see size of orbit of A=(0,1,3) under rotation.\n\nRotations: k=0 to 6 gives 7 triples, unless symmetric. Is (0,1,3) invariant under nontrivial rotation? No, since 7 is prime, orbit size is 7 unless triple is invariant, which it's not. So orbit of A has 7 triples.\n\nSimilarly, orbit of B=(0,1,5): also 7? But 7+7=14, and no overlap? Check if A-orbit and B-orbit intersect.\n\nA-orbit includes (0,1,3), (1,2,4), (2,3,5), (3,4,6), (4,5,0), (5,6,1), (6,0,2)\n\nList:\n\nk=0: (0,1,3)  \nk=1: (1,2,4)  \nk=2: (2,3,5)  \nk=3: (3,4,6)  \nk=4: (4,5,0)  \nk=5: (5,6,1)  \nk=6: (6,0,2)\n\nThat's 7.\n\nB-orbit: (0,1,5), (1,2,6), (2,3,0)=(0,2,3), (3,4,1)=(1,3,4), (4,5,2)=(2,4,5), (5,6,3)=(3,5,6), (6,0,4)=(0,4,6)\n\nThat's another 7, all distinct from A-orbit? Compare:\n\nA has (0,1,3), B has (0,1,5) — different.\n\nA has (1,2,4), B has (1,2,6) — different.\n\nA has (2,3,5), B has (0,2,3) — different.\n\nSo yes, two disjoint orbits of size 7 → total 14 scalene triples.\n\nSo the 14 scalene triples are exactly the 7 rotations of (0,1,3) and 7 rotations of (0,1,5).\n\nNow, back to counting, for a fixed $ v $, say $ v = 0 $, how many ways to partition $ \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\} $ into two disjoint scalene triples.\n\nSo we need unordered pairs $ \\{T_1,T_2\\} $, $ T_1 \\cup T_2 = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\} $, $ |T_1|=|T_2|=3 $, both scalene.\n\nList all scalene triples that are subsets of {1,2,3,4,5,6} (i.e., don't contain 0).\n\nFrom A-orbit: which ones avoid 0?\n\nA-orbit: (0,1,3), (1,2,4), (2,3,5), (3,4,6), (4,5,0), (5,6,1), (6,0,2)\n\nThose without 0: (1,2,4), (2,3,5), (3,4,6), (5,6,1) — (5,6,1) = (1,5,6), and (6,0,2) has 0, (4,5,0) has 0, (0,1,3) has 0. So four from A-orbit.\n\nSimilarly B-orbit: (0,1,5), (1,2,6), (0,2,3), (1,3,4), (2,4,5), (3,5,6), (0,4,6)\n\nWithout 0: (1,2,6), (1,3,4), (2,4,5), (3,5,6) — four.\n\nSo total scalene triples within {1,2,3,4,5,6}: 8.\n\nList them:\n\nFrom A:  \n- (1,2,4)  \n- (2,3,5)  \n- (3,4,6)  \n- (1,5,6)  [since (5,6,1)]\n\nFrom B:  \n- (1,2,6)  \n- (1,3,4)  \n- (2,4,5)  \n- (3,5,6)\n\nThat's 8.\n\nNow, from these 8, how many unordered pairs $ \\{T_1,T_2\\} $ partition {1,2,3,4,5,6}?\n\nThat is, $ T_1 \\cap T_2 = \\emptyset $, $ T_1 \\cup T_2 = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\} $.\n\nSo for each $ T_1 $ in the 8, check if its complement in {1..6} is also in the 8.\n\nBecause $ T_2 $ must be the complement, size 3.\n\nSo for each of the 8 triples, compute complement in {1,2,3,4,5,6}, and check if complement is also scalene (i.e., in the list).\n\nLet’s list each and complement:\n\n1. T = (1,2,4), complement = {3,5,6} → is (3,5,6) in list? Yes, from B-orbit. So ✅\n\n2. T = (2,3,5), complement = {1,4,6} → is (1,4,6) scalene? Not in our list. Our list has (1,2,6), (1,3,4), etc. (1,4,6): check if scalene. Compute pairwise distances: |1-4|=3, |1-6|=5→min(5,2)=2, |4-6|=2 → {2,2,3} → not scalene. So ❌\n\n3. T = (3,4,6), complement = {1,2,5} → (1,2,5): |1-2|=1, |1-5|=4→min(4,3)=3, |2-5|=3 → {1,3,3} → not scalene. ❌\n\n4. T = (1,5,6), complement = {2,3,4} → (2,3,4): |2-3|=1, |3-4|=1, |2-4|=2 → {1,1,2} → not scalene. ❌\n\n5. T = (1,2,6), complement = {3,4,5} → (3,4,5): |3-4|=1, |4-5|=1, |3-5|=2 → {1,1,2} → ❌\n\n6. T = (1,3,4), complement = {2,5,6} → (2,5,6): |2-5|=3, |5-6|=1, |2-6|=4→min(4,3)=3 → {1,3,3} → ❌\n\n7. T = (2,4,5), complement = {1,3,6} → (1,3,6): |1-3|=2, |3-6|=3, |1-6|=1 → {1,2,3} → ✅ Is (1,3,6) in our list? Our list has (1,2,4), (2,3,5), (3,4,6), (1,5,6), (1,2,6), (1,3,4), (2,4,5), (3,5,6). Not (1,3,6). But is it scalene? Yes, {1,2,3}. So did we miss it?\n\nEarlier we listed only rotations of A and B, but (1,3,6): differences: 1-3=2, 3-6=3, 1-6=5→min=2? Wait |1-6|=5, 7-5=2, yes min=2. So steps: 2,3,2 → {2,2,3}? Wait no:\n\nPairs: (1,3): min(|1-3|,7-|1-3|)=min(2,5)=2  \n(3,6): min(3,4)=3  \n(1,6): min(5,2)=2  \nSo {2,2,3} → not scalene! I miscalculated.\n\n|1-6| = 5, min(5,7-5)=min(5,2)=2. Yes. So (1,3,6) has steps 2,3,2 → not scalene.\n\nSo complement (1,3,6) is not scalene.\n\n8. T = (3,5,6), complement = {1,2,4} → (1,2,4) is in list (first one). So ✅\n\nSo far, only two pairs:  \n- T1=(1,2,4), T2=(3,5,6)  \n- T1=(3,5,6), T2=(1,2,4) — same unordered pair.\n\nAnd T1=(1,2,6)? Complement {3,4,5} not scalene.\n\nWait, we have T=(1,2,4) → complement (3,5,6) ∈ list  \nT=(3,5,6) → complement (1,2,4) ∈ list — same pair.\n\nAre there others?\n\nWhat about T=(2,4,5), complement {1,3,6} — not scalene.\n\nT=(1,3,4), complement {2,5,6} — not.\n\nBut earlier we have only two working.\n\nWait, check T=(2,3,5), complement {1,4,6} — we said not scalene, but verify (1,4,6):  \n|1-4|=3, |4-6|=2, |1-6|=2 → {2,2,3} → no.\n\nT=(3,4,6), complement {1,2,5}: |1-2|=1, |2-5|=3, |1-5|=4→min=3 → {1,3,3}\n\nT=(1,5,6), complement {2,3,4}: {1,1,2}\n\nT=(1,2,6), complement {3,4,5}: {1,1,2}\n\nT=(1,3,4), complement {2,5,6}: |2-5|=3, |5-6|=1, |2-6|=4→min=3 → {1,3,3}\n\nT=(2,4,5), complement {1,3,6}: as above {2,2,3}\n\nT=(3,5,6), complement {1,2,4} — already counted.\n\nSo only one unordered pair for v=0: { (1,2,4), (3,5,6) }\n\nBut wait, is (3,5,6) in our list? Yes, from B-orbit.\n\nAnd (1,2,4) from A-orbit.\n\nSo one partition.\n\nBut is there another? What about (1,2,6) and ? No.\n\nPerhaps (2,3,5) and ? No.\n\nSo only one way for v=0.\n\nBy symmetry, for each v, there is exactly one such partition? Let's test v=1.\n\nRemove v=1, remaining {0,2,3,4,5,6}\n\nScalene triples not containing 1: from A-orbit: (0,1,3) has 1, exclude; (1,2,4) has 1; (2,3,5) no 1; (3,4,6) no 1; (4,5,0) = (0,4,5) no 1; (5,6,1) has 1; (6,0,2) = (0,2,6) no 1.\n\nSo from A: (2,3,5), (3,4,6), (0,4,5), (0,2,6) — four.\n\nFrom B: (0,1,5) has 1; (1,2,6) has 1; (0,2,3) no 1; (1,3,4) has 1; (2,4,5) no 1; (3,5,6) no 1; (0,4,6) no 1.\n\nSo (0,2,3), (2,4,5), (3,5,6), (0,4,6) — four.\n\nTotal 8 again.\n\nNow look for complementary pairs.\n\nTake (2,3,5), complement {0,4,6} → (0,4,6) is in list (B-orbit, yes). So { (2,3,5), (0,4,6) } is a partition.\n\nSimilarly, (0,4,6) complement is (2,3,5).\n\nSo again one partition.\n\nThus for each v, there is exactly one way to partition the remaining 6 vertices into two disjoint scalene triangles.\n\nSince there are 7 choices for v, total number of such partitions $ \\{T_1,T_2,\\{v\\}\\} $ is 7.\n\nEach partition has 3 parts: two triangles and a singleton. Assign 3 distinct colors: 3! = 6 ways.\n\nSo $ N_1 = 7 \\times 6 = 42 $.\n\nThen $ m = N_1 + 1968 = 42 + 1968 = 2010 $.\n\nSo answer to Problem 1 is 2010.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> Let $ S_{0}=0 $ and let $ S_{k} = a_{1} + 2 a_{2} + \\ldots + k a_{k} $ for $ k \\geq 1 $.

Let's verify:\n\nn=1: (3^2 - 3)/2 = 3 ✔  \nn=2: (3^3 - 3)/2 = 12 ✔  \nn=3: (3^4 - 3)/2 = 39 ✔  \nn=4: 120 ✔  \nn=5: 363 ✔  \nn=6: 1092 ✔  \nn=7: 3279 > 2010.\n\nSo largest k ≤ 2010 in this sequence is 1092.\n\nBut is S₁₀₉₂ really 0?
