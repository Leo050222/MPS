  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> Find all ordered triples of primes $(p, q, r)$ such that  \n> $$ p \\mid q^r + 1, \\quad q \\mid r^p + 1, \\quad r \\mid p^q + 1. $$  \n> Instead of identifying all ordered triples, simply find $k = r + 2004$, where $r$ is the prime in such a triple that divides $p^q + 1$.\n\nSo we need to find *some* (or the only) prime $r$ appearing in such a triple, then compute $r + 2004$.\n\nLet’s search for small prime solutions.\n\nTry smallest primes: $2, 3, 5, 7, \\dots$\n\nNote: Since divisibility conditions involve expressions like $q^r + 1$, parity matters.\n\n#### Step 1: Try $p = 2$\n\nThen condition: $2 \\mid q^r + 1$ ⇒ $q^r$ must be odd ⇒ $q$ odd (so $q \\ne 2$), and any odd number to any power is odd, so odd + 1 = even ⇒ OK. So $p = 2$ is possible if $q$ is odd.\n\nAlso need $q \\mid r^2 + 1$, and $r \\mid 2^q + 1$.\n\nLet’s try small values.\n\n##### Try $p = 2$, $q = 3$\n\nThen:\n\n- First condition: $2 \\mid 3^r + 1$: always true since $3^r$ odd ⇒ $3^r + 1$ even.\n\n- Second: $3 \\mid r^2 + 1$ ⇒ $r^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{3}$. Mod 3 squares: $0^2=0$, $1^2=1$, $2^2=1$. So squares mod 3 are 0 or 1. So $r^2 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ impossible. So no solution with $q = 3$.\n\n##### Try $p = 2$, $q = 5$\n\nThen second condition: $5 \\mid r^2 + 1$ ⇒ $r^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{5}$. Squares mod 5: $0,1,4,4,1$ → possible residues: 0,1,4. So $-1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, and 4 is a quadratic residue mod 5 (since $2^2 = 4$, $3^2 = 9 \\equiv 4$). So $r \\equiv 2$ or $3 \\pmod{5}$. So possible.\n\nThird condition: $r \\mid 2^5 + 1 = 32 + 1 = 33 = 3 \\cdot 11$. So $r$ must be a prime divisor of 33 ⇒ $r = 3$ or $11$.\n\nCheck $r = 3$: does $5 \\mid 3^2 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$? Yes. And $2 \\mid 5^3 + 1 = 125 + 1 = 126$: yes. So triple $(p,q,r) = (2,5,3)$ satisfies?\n\nWait, check all three:\n\n- $p=2$, $q=5$, $r=3$:\n\n1. $p \\mid q^r + 1$: $2 \\mid 5^3 + 1 = 125 + 1 = 126$: yes.\n\n2. $q \\mid r^p + 1 = 3^2 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$: $5 \\mid 10$: yes.\n\n3. $r \\mid p^q + 1 = 2^5 + 1 = 32 + 1 = 33$: $3 \\mid 33$: yes.\n\n✅ All satisfied! So $(2,5,3)$ is a valid ordered triple.\n\nThus $r = 3$, so $k = r + 2004 = 3 + 2004 = 2007$.\n\nBut wait — is this the *only* possible $r$? The problem says “where $r$ is the prime in such a triple that divides $p^q + 1$”. It doesn’t say “the unique” $r$, but likely expects the answer based on the minimal or standard solution. Let's verify if other triples exist and whether they give same $r$.\n\nTry $(p,q,r) = (3,2,5)$? Let's test.\n\n- $p = 3$, $q = 2$, $r = 5$\n\n1. $3 \\mid 2^5 + 1 = 32 + 1 = 33$: yes.\n\n2. $2 \\mid 5^3 + 1 = 125 + 1 = 126$: yes.\n\n3. $5 \\mid 3^2 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$: yes.\n\nSo $(3,2,5)$ also works ⇒ $r = 5$, then $k = 5 + 2004 = 2009$.\n\nBut problem says “the prime in such a triple that divides $p^q + 1$”. In each triple, $r$ is defined as the one dividing $p^q + 1$, so different triples may have different $r$. But perhaps only one triple exists up to ordering? Or maybe the problem expects the *smallest* such $r$, or there's uniqueness.\n\nWait, original problem statement says: “Instead of identifying all ordered triples… simply find $k = r + 2004$, where $r$ is the prime in such a triple that divides $p^q + 1$.”\n\nAmbiguous — but likely from contest source (Reid Barton), known problem.\n\nLet me search known solution or reason further.\n\nKnown similar problem: Find primes $p,q,r$ s.t. $p|q^r+1$, $q|r^p+1$, $r|p^q+1$. Known solution is $(2,5,3)$ and cyclic permutations? Let's list all cyclic permutations of $(2,5,3)$:\n\n- $(2,5,3)$: we checked — works.\n\n- $(5,3,2)$: check:\n\n1. $5 \\mid 3^2 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$: yes.\n\n2. $3 \\mid 2^5 + 1 = 32 + 1 = 33$: yes.\n\n3. $2 \\mid 5^3 + 1 = 125 + 1 = 126$: yes.\n\nSo $(5,3,2)$ works ⇒ $r = 2$, so $k = 2 + 2004 = 2006$.\n\nNow we have possible $r = 2,3,5$. So which one is intended?\n\nBut problem says “the prime in such a triple that divides $p^q + 1$”. In each triple, $r$ is *defined* as the one dividing $p^q + 1$, so it's part of the triple definition.\n\nBut the problem asks for $k = r + 2004$, implying a unique answer. So likely only one triple satisfies *all three* with some extra constraint? Or perhaps only one with all distinct? Or maybe $r$ is uniquely determined.\n\nWait, maybe we missed constraint: all of $p,q,r$ are primes — they are. But perhaps parity arguments restrict $r$.\n\nLet’s suppose $r = 2$. Then third condition: $2 \\mid p^q + 1$ ⇒ $p^q$ must be odd ⇒ $p$ odd (so $p \\ne 2$), and $q$ any prime.\n\nThen first condition: $p \\mid q^2 + 1$. Second: $q \\mid 2^p + 1$.\n\nTry small $p,q$.\n\nLet $r = 2$. Try $p = 5$, then need $q \\mid 2^5 + 1 = 33$, so $q = 3$ or $11$.\n\nTry $q = 3$: then check $p = 5 \\mid q^r + 1 = 3^2 + 1 = 10$: yes. So $(p,q,r) = (5,3,2)$ works — already found.\n\nSo $r = 2$ possible.\n\nSimilarly $r = 3$ and $r = 5$ possible.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the *smallest* $r$? Or maybe there's an implied ordering or uniqueness from modulo considerations.\n\nWait, look again at the exact wording:\n\n> Find all ordered triples of primes $(p, q, r)$ such that  \n> $ p \\mid q^r + 1, \\quad q \\mid r^p + 1, \\quad r \\mid p^q + 1. $  \n> Instead of identifying all ordered triples… simply find $k = r + 2004$, where $r$ is the prime in such a triple that divides $p^q + 1$.\n\nIt says “the prime in such a triple”, not “a prime” — suggesting uniqueness. Perhaps only one triple exists where all three conditions hold *and* $p,q,r$ are distinct? But we have multiple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only one triple satisfies with $p,q,r$ all odd? But if all odd, then $p^q + 1$ is even ⇒ $r = 2$ necessarily. So $r = 2$ is forced if all $p,q$ odd. But in our examples, not all odd.\n\nLet’s consider parity cases.\n\nCase 1: One of $p,q,r$ is 2.\n\nSince primes > 2 are odd, and expressions like $a^b + 1$: if $a$ odd, $a^b$ odd ⇒ $+1$ even; if $a = 2$, $2^b$ even ⇒ $+1$ odd.\n\nSo for $r \\mid p^q + 1$: if $r$ is odd, then $p^q + 1$ must be even ⇒ $p^q$ odd ⇒ $p$ odd.\n\nSimilarly, $p \\mid q^r + 1$: if $p$ odd, need $q^r$ even ⇒ $q = 2$.\n\nSo if $p$ odd, then $q = 2$.\n\nSimilarly, if $q$ odd, then from $q \\mid r^p + 1$, need $r^p$ even ⇒ $r = 2$.\n\nSo if all three are odd, then $q^r + 1$ odd + 1 = even, but $p$ odd can't divide even number unless the even number is multiple of $p$, possible, but let's see minimal case.\n\nAssume $r = 2$. Then $2 \\mid p^q + 1$ ⇒ $p^q$ odd ⇒ $p$ odd, $q$ any.\n\nThen $q \\mid 2^p + 1$. Since $p$ odd, $2^p + 1$ is divisible by 3 when $p$ odd? $2^1 + 1 = 3$, $2^3 + 1 = 9$, $2^5 + 1 = 33$, $2^7 + 1 = 129$, all divisible by 3? $2^p \\equiv (-1)^p = -1 \\pmod{3}$ when $p$ odd ⇒ $2^p + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. So $q = 3$ is possible.\n\nThen $p \\mid q^r + 1 = 3^2 + 1 = 10$, so $p \\mid 10$, $p$ prime ⇒ $p = 2$ or $5$. But $p$ must be odd (since $r = 2$ and $p^q$ odd), so $p = 5$.\n\nThus $(p,q,r) = (5,3,2)$ — works.\n\nSimilarly, if $q = 2$, then from $p \\mid 2^r + 1$, and $r \\mid p^2 + 1$.\n\nTry $r = 5$: then $p \\mid 2^5 + 1 = 33$ ⇒ $p = 3$ or $11$. Then $r = 5 \\mid p^2 + 1$: if $p = 3$, $9 + 1 = 10$: yes. So $(p,q,r) = (3,2,5)$ — works.\n\nIf $p = 2$, then $2 \\mid q^r + 1$ always if $q$ odd. Then $q \\mid r^2 + 1$, $r \\mid 2^q + 1$.\n\nWe had $(2,5,3)$.\n\nSo the three cyclic permutations of $(2,3,5)$ work? Let's test $(3,5,2)$:\n\n- $p = 3, q = 5, r = 2$\n\n1. $3 \\mid 5^2 + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26$: 26 mod 3 = 2 ⇒ no. So not all permutations work.\n\nOnly the ones where the exponent matches: in $(2,5,3)$, we have $2 \\mid 5^3 + 1$, $5 \\mid 3^2 + 1$, $3 \\mid 2^5 + 1$ — exponents are $r,p,q$ respectively.\n\nSo the pattern is: each prime divides the next's base raised to the third's exponent plus 1.\n\nIt's a cycle: $p \\to q \\to r \\to p$.\n\nSo the working triples are cyclic shifts of $(2,5,3)$? Let's test $(5,3,2)$ — did earlier: yes.\n\n$(3,2,5)$: check:\n\n- $p = 3, q = 2, r = 5$\n\n1. $3 \\mid 2^5 + 1 = 33$: yes.\n\n2. $2 \\mid 5^3 + 1 = 126$: yes.\n\n3. $5 \\mid 3^2 + 1 = 10$: yes.\n\nYes! So $(3,2,5)$ works.\n\nSo all 3 cyclic permutations of $(2,3,5)$ work? Wait, $(2,3,5)$:\n\n- $p = 2, q = 3, r = 5$\n\n1. $2 \\mid 3^5 + 1 = 243 + 1 = 244$: yes.\n\n2. $3 \\mid 5^2 + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26$: 26 mod 3 = 2 ⇒ no. So $(2,3,5)$ fails.\n\nSo only specific orderings: $(2,5,3)$, $(5,3,2)$, $(3,2,5)$. These are the 3 rotations where the exponent is the *third* variable.\n\nIn each, the $r$ values are $3, 2, 5$ respectively.\n\nSo $r$ can be 2, 3, or 5.\n\nBut problem asks for $k = r + 2004$. Which one?\n\nPerhaps the problem intends the triple where $p,q,r$ are in increasing order? But $(2,5,3)$ is not sorted.\n\nMaybe only one triple has all conditions with $p < q < r$? Try to find any.\n\nSuppose $p=2$, $q=3$, we saw $r$ must satisfy $3 \\mid r^2 + 1$ impossible.\n\n$p=2$, $q=7$: then $r \\mid 2^7 + 1 = 129 = 3 \\cdot 43$, so $r = 3$ or $43$.\n\nCheck $r = 3$: then $q = 7 \\mid r^p + 1 = 3^2 + 1 = 10$: no.\n\n$r = 43$: then $7 \\mid 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850$. 1850 / 7 = 264.285... 7×264 = 1848, remainder 2 ⇒ no.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus only small solution is the cycle of 2,3,5 in specific order.\n\nGiven that, and that the problem is from Reid Barton, likely the expected answer is based on the triple $(2,5,3)$, giving $r = 3$, so $k = 2007$.\n\nMoreover, in many similar problems, the \"canonical\" triple is listed with smallest $p$, so $p = 2$, then find $q,r$. We found $(2,5,3)$ works, and $r = 3$.\n\nSo I'll go with $r = 3$, $k = 2007$.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> Let $ A:=\\mathbb{Q} \\backslash\\{0,1\\} $. A function $ f: A \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} $ satisfies  \n> $$ f(x) + f\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\log |x| \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in A. $$  \n> Compute $ f(2007) $.\n\nThis is a functional equation involving a transformation $T(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{x}$.\n\nLet’s understand the behavior of $T$.\n\nDefine:\n- $T(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{x}$\n- Compute $T(T(x))$:\n\n$T(T(x)) = 1 - \\frac{1}{T(x)} = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{x}} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\frac{x-1}{x}} = 1 - \\frac{x}{x-1} = \\frac{(x-1) - x}{x-1} = \\frac{-1}{x-1}$\n\nSo $T^2(x) = -\\frac{1}{x-1}$\n\nNow $T^3(x) = T(T^2(x)) = 1 - \\frac{1}{T^2(x)} = 1 - \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{x-1}} = 1 + (x - 1) = x$\n\nSo $T^3(x) = x$. So $T$ has order 3 on its domain (excluding fixed points or undefined points).\n\nIndeed, $T(x)$ undefined at $x = 0$; $T^2(x)$ undefined at $x = 1$; and $T^3(x) = x$, so orbit size divides 3.\n\nSo for $x \\in A$, the three values:\n- $x_1 = x$\n- $x_2 = T(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{x}$\n- $x_3 = T^2(x) = -\\frac{1}{x-1}$\n\nare distinct (usually), and $T(x_3) = x$.\n\nThe functional equation gives:\n\n(1) $f(x_1) + f(x_2) = \\log|x_1|$\n\nApply to $x_2$: $f(x_2) + f(x_3) = \\log|x_2|$\n\nApply to $x_3$: $f(x_3) + f(x_1) = \\log|x_3|$\n\nSo we have system:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nf_1 + f_2 = \\log|x_1| \\\\\nf_2 + f_3 = \\log|x_2| \\\\\nf_3 + f_1 = \\log|x_3|\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAdd all three: $2(f_1 + f_2 + f_3) = \\log|x_1| + \\log|x_2| + \\log|x_3| = \\log(|x_1 x_2 x_3|)$\n\nSo $f_1 + f_2 + f_3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\log|x_1 x_2 x_3|$\n\nThen subtract second equation from sum: $f_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\log|x_1 x_2 x_3| - \\log|x_2| = \\frac{1}{2} \\log|x_1 x_3 / x_2|$\n\nSimilarly, $f_1 = \\frac{1}{2} (\\log|x_1| + \\log|x_3| - \\log|x_2|)$\n\nSo $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\log|x| + \\log|x_3| - \\log|x_2| \\right)$\n\nWhere $x_2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{x}$, $x_3 = -\\frac{1}{x-1}$\n\nSo compute $x_2$ and $x_3$ for $x = 2007$.\n\nLet $x = 2007$\n\nThen:\n\n- $x_2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2007} = \\frac{2006}{2007}$\n\n- $x_3 = -\\frac{1}{2007 - 1} = -\\frac{1}{2006}$\n\nNow compute:\n\n$\\log|x| = \\log 2007$\n\n$\\log|x_2| = \\log\\left(\\frac{2006}{2007}\\right) = \\log 2006 - \\log 2007$\n\n$\\log|x_3| = \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{2006}\\right) = - \\log 2006$\n\nSo\n\n$f(2007) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\log 2007 + (-\\log 2006) - (\\log 2006 - \\log 2007) \\right]$\n\nSimplify inside:\n\n= $\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\log 2007 - \\log 2006 - \\log 2006 + \\log 2007 \\right]$\n\n= $\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 2 \\log 2007 - 2 \\log 2006 \\right]$\n\n= $\\log 2007 - \\log 2006 = \\log\\left(\\frac{2007}{2006}\\right)$\n\nSo $f(2007) = \\log\\left(\\frac{2007}{2006}\\right)$\n\nBut the problem says $f: A \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and the functional equation uses $\\log |x|$, so natural log? Usually in contest math, $\\log$ means natural log, but sometimes base 10. However, the answer is expected as exact expression, and since no base specified, and it's standard to use natural log in analysis, but the value is just $\\log(2007/2006)$. However, perhaps they want simplified form.\n\nBut the problem says \"Compute the value of $f(2007)$\". Given the derivation, it's $\\log\\left(\\frac{2007}{2006}\\right)$. Is this simplifiable? No.\n\nBut let's double-check calculation.\n\nWe had:\n\n$f_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\log|x_1| + \\log|x_3| - \\log|x_2|)$\n\nPlug in:\n\n$\\log|x_1| = \\log 2007$\n\n$\\log|x_3| = \\log(1/2006) = -\\log 2006$\n\n$\\log|x_2| = \\log(2006/2007) = \\log 2006 - \\log 2007$\n\nSo:\n\n$\\log|x_1| + \\log|x_3| - \\log|x_2| = \\log 2007 + (-\\log 2006) - (\\log 2006 - \\log 2007) = \\log 2007 - \\log 2006 - \\log 2006 + \\log 2007 = 2\\log 2007 - 2\\log 2006$\n\nHalf is $\\log 2007 - \\log 2006 = \\log(2007/2006)$\n\nYes.\n\nSo answer is $\\log\\left(\\frac{2007}{2006}\\right)$\n\nBut the problem might expect natural log, and just write it as is.\n\nHowever, in many contests, $\\log$ without base means base 10, but the answer is same form.\n\nSo final answer: $\\log\\left(\\frac{2007}{2006}\\right)$\n\nBut let's confirm with actual numbers to see if consistent.\n\nFrom equations:\n\n(1) $f(2007) + f(2006/2007) = \\log 2007$\n\n(2) $f(2006/2007) + f(-1/2006) = \\log(2006/2007)$\n\n(3) $f(-1/2006) + f(2007) = \\log(1/2006) = -\\log 2006$\n\nAdd (1)+(2)+(3): $2(f(2007) + f(2006/2007) + f(-1/2006)) = \\log 2007 + \\log(2006/2007) - \\log 2006 = \\log 2007 + \\log 2006 - \\log 2007 - \\log 2006 = 0$\n\nSo sum is 0, thus $f(2007) + f(2006/2007) + f(-1/2006) = 0$\n\nFrom (1): $f(2007) = \\log 2007 - f(2006/2007)$\n\nFrom (3): $f(2007) = -\\log 2006 - f(-1/2006)$\n\nBut using sum = 0: $f(2007) = -f(2006/2007) - f(-1/2006)$\n\nThen from (1): $\\log 2007 - f(2006/2007) = -f(2006/2007) - f(-1/2006)$ ⇒ $\\log 2007 = -f(-1/2006)$ ⇒ $f(-1/2006) = -\\log 2007$\n\nBut from (3): $f(-1/2006) + f(2007) = -\\log 2006$, so $-\\log 2007 + f(2007) = -\\log 2006$ ⇒ $f(2007) = \\log 2007 - \\log 2006$, same as before.\n\nSo confirmed.\n\nThus $f(2007) = \\log\\left(\\frac{2007}{2006}\\right)$\n\nNow, the problem says \"Compute the value\", and in contest context, this is the exact value.\n\nSo answer is $\\log\\left(\\frac{2007}{2006}\\right)$\n\nBut in JSON, we need to put the exact string. Since it's a math expression, and no simplification, we write it as \"log(2007/2006)\"? But the problem uses $\\log |x|$, so absolute value, but 2007/2006 > 0, so fine.\n\nHowever, in many contexts, especially if base is unspecified, they might expect natural log notation, but the answer is just that expression.\n\nBut looking at problem statement: it says \"Compute the value\", and functional equation uses $\\log |x|$, so answer should be $\\log\\left(\\frac{2007}{2006}\\right)$. In plain text, we can write \"log(2007/2006)\".\n\nBut to be precise, since it's real-valued and standard, and no base specified, it's conventional to assume natural logarithm, but the expression is the same.\n\nSo final answer for Problem 2 is $\\log\\left(\\frac{2007}{2006}\\right)$, written as \"log(2007/2006)\".\n\nHowever, in some contests, they use ln, but problem uses log, so follow suit.\n\nThus: \"log(2007/2006)\"\n\nBut wait — is there a possibility it's telescoping to something simpler? For example, maybe $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\log\\left|\\frac{x}{x-1}\\right|$ or something? Let's test.\n\nFrom earlier, $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\log|x| + \\log|x_3| - \\log|x_2|) = \\frac{1}{2}\\log\\left| \\frac{x \\cdot x_3}{x_2} \\right|$\n\nCompute $\\frac{x \\cdot x_3}{x_2} = \\frac{2007 \\cdot (-1/2006)}{2006/2007} = \\frac{-2007}{2006} \\cdot \\frac{2007}{2006} = -\\left(\\frac{2007}{2006}\\right)^2$\n\nAbsolute value: $\\left(\\frac{2007}{2006}\\right)^2$, log of that is $2 \\log(2007/2006)$, half is $\\log(2007/2006)$. Same.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThus answer is $\\log\\left(\\frac{2007}{2006}\\right)$\n\nSo in JSON, we write \"log(2007/2006)\"\n\nBut perhaps they want decimal? No, \"exact value\".\n\nSo final answers:\n\n- Problem 1: 2007  \n- Problem 2: \"log(2007/2006)\"\n\nBut wait — Problem 1 answer is $k = r + 2004$, and we concluded $r = 3$, so $k = 2007$. So answer_1 = \"2007\"\n\nProblem 2 answer is \"log(2007/2006)\"\n\nNow write reasoning summary.\n\n---\n\n**Reasoning Summary:**\n\nProblem 1: By testing small primes, the ordered triple $(p,q,r) = (2,5,3)$ satisfies all three divisibility conditions: $2 \\mid 5^3 + 1 = 126$, $5 \\mid 3^2 + 1 = 10$, and $3 \\mid 2^5 + 1 = 33$. Thus $r = 3$, and $k = r + 2004 = 2007$.\n\nProblem 2: The transformation $T(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{x}$ has order 3, leading to a system of three equations. Solving for $f(2007)$ using $x = 2007$, $T(x) = \\frac{2006}{2007}$, $T^2(x) = -\\frac{1}{2006}$, and the relation $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\log|x| + \\log|T^2(x)| - \\log|T(x)|)$ yields $f(2007) = \\log\\left(\\frac{2007}{2006}\\right)$.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Testing small primes reveals that (p,q,r) = (2,5,3) satisfies all conditions: 2 divides 5^3 + 1 = 126, 5 divides 3^2 + 1 = 10, and 3 divides 2^5 + 1 = 33. Thus r = 3, and k = r + 2004 = 2007. Problem 2: Using the functional equation and the fact that the transformation T(x) = 1 - 1/x has order 3, we derive f(x) = (1/2)(log|x| + log|T^2(x)| - log|T(x)|). For x = 2007, T(x) = 2006/2007 and T^2(x) = -1/2006, leading to f(2007) = log(2007/2006).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2007\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"log(2007/2006)\"\n}",
