  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1 Analysis**\n\n> Find all natural numbers $ n (n \\geq 2) $ such that there exists reals $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ which satisfy  \n> $$ \\{ |a_i - a_j| \\mid 1\\leq i<j \\leq n\\} = \\left\\{1,2,\\dots,\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\right\\}. $$\n\nThis is a classic problem about *distance sets*: can the set of pairwise distances among $ n $ real numbers be exactly the first $ \\binom{n}{2} $ positive integers?\n\nLet’s denote $ D_n = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} $. So we need $ \\binom{n}{2} $ distinct positive integer distances, and they must be precisely $ 1, 2, ..., D_n $.\n\nThis is related to *Golomb rulers*, but Golomb rulers require *all pairwise differences to be distinct*, not necessarily covering a full interval. Here, it's stronger: not only distinct, but *consecutive integers from 1 to $ \\binom{n}{2} $*.\n\nLet’s test small $ n $:\n\n- $ n = 2 $: $ \\binom{2}{2} = 1 $, need distance set = {1}. Easy: choose $ a_1 = 0, a_2 = 1 $. OK.\n\n- $ n = 3 $: $ \\binom{3}{2} = 3 $, need distances {1,2,3}. Can three points on line have pairwise distances 1,2,3? Suppose points at positions $ x < y < z $. Then distances: $ y-x, z-y, z-x $. These must be 1,2,3 in some order. Note $ z-x = (z-y) + (y-x) $, so largest distance must equal sum of two smaller ones. Indeed, 3 = 1 + 2. So set $ y-x = 1, z-y = 2 \\Rightarrow z-x = 3 $. So positions: 0,1,3 → distances: 1,2,3. Works.\n\n- $ n = 4 $: $ \\binom{4}{2} = 6 $, need distances {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Is it possible?\n\nLet’s suppose points sorted: $ a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4 $. Then distances include:\n- Adjacent: $ d_1 = a_2-a_1 $, $ d_2 = a_3-a_2 $, $ d_3 = a_4-a_3 $\n- Next: $ a_3-a_1 = d_1+d_2 $, $ a_4-a_2 = d_2+d_3 $, $ a_4-a_1 = d_1+d_2+d_3 $\n\nSo the six distances are:\n- $ d_1, d_2, d_3 $\n- $ d_1+d_2, d_2+d_3, d_1+d_2+d_3 $\n\nAll must be distinct integers from 1 to 6.\n\nLet’s try to assign smallest possible $ d_i $’s.\n\nSuppose $ d_1 = 1 $. To get distance 2, could be $ d_2 = 2 $, then $ d_1+d_2 = 3 $. So far: 1,2,3.\n\nThen need 4,5,6 from remaining: $ d_3 $, $ d_2+d_3 = 2+d_3 $, $ d_1+d_2+d_3 = 3+d_3 $. So these three are $ d_3, d_3+2, d_3+3 $. To get {4,5,6}, try $ d_3 = 4 $: then values are 4,6,7 — too big (7 > 6). Try $ d_3 = 3 $: then 3,5,6 — but 3 already used (as $ d_1+d_2 $), and also $ d_3 = 3 $ duplicates. Try $ d_3 = 4 $ gives 4,6,7 → 7 invalid.\n\nTry $ d_1 = 1, d_2 = 3 $: then $ d_1+d_2 = 4 $. So far: 1,3,4. Need 2,5,6. Then $ d_3 $ must be 2? Then $ d_2+d_3 = 5 $, $ d_1+d_2+d_3 = 6 $. Yes! So $ d_1 = 1, d_2 = 3, d_3 = 2 $. But ordering requires $ a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4 $, so gaps just need to be positive; order of $ d_i $ doesn’t matter as long as positive. So positions: 0, 1, 4, 6 → differences:\n\n- 1−0 = 1  \n- 4−1 = 3  \n- 6−4 = 2  \n- 4−0 = 4  \n- 6−1 = 5  \n- 6−0 = 6  \n\nSet = {1,2,3,4,5,6}. ✅ Works.\n\nSo $ n = 4 $ works.\n\n- $ n = 5 $: $ \\binom{5}{2} = 10 $, need distances {1,2,…,10}.\n\nNow this becomes harder. Known result: Such a set is called a *B_h set* or more specifically, a *Sidon set* with consecutive differences — but here it's not Sidon (which requires all differences distinct), it's stronger: differences must be *exactly* the first $ \\binom{n}{2} $ integers.\n\nThere is a known impossibility result: For $ n \\geq 5 $, it's impossible to have $ n $ real numbers whose pairwise distances are exactly $ \\{1,2,\\dots,\\binom{n}{2}\\} $.\n\nWhy? Because the largest distance is $ \\max a_i - \\min a_i = D = \\binom{n}{2} $. So the total length of the interval spanned is $ D $. But the number of points is $ n $, so by pigeonhole, some adjacent gap must be ≤ $ D/(n-1) $. For $ n = 5 $, $ D = 10 $, so average gap = 10/4 = 2.5. Possible.\n\nBut more deeply: The multiset of all pairwise distances for $ n = 5 $ includes:\n\n- 4 adjacent gaps: $ d_1,d_2,d_3,d_4 $\n- 3 “skip-1” gaps: $ d_1+d_2, d_2+d_3, d_3+d_4 $\n- 2 “skip-2”: $ d_1+d_2+d_3, d_2+d_3+d_4 $\n- 1 full span: $ d_1+d_2+d_3+d_4 = 10 $\n\nSo total 10 distances.\n\nThey must be exactly 1 through 10.\n\nNote that the full span is 10 ⇒ $ d_1+d_2+d_3+d_4 = 10 $. All $ d_i \\ge 1 $, integers? Wait — problem says *reals* $ a_i $, not necessarily integers. So distances need to be integers 1 through 10, but positions can be real.\n\nBut absolute differences must be exactly those integers — so the set of $ |a_i - a_j| $ must equal that integer set. So distances are forced to be integers, but points need not be integers.\n\nHowever, if all pairwise distances among $ n $ points on a line are integers, then the points can be taken on integer lattice after scaling/translation? Not necessarily — e.g., $ 0, \\sqrt{2}, 1+\\sqrt{2} $ has distances $ \\sqrt{2}, 1, 1+\\sqrt{2} $ — not all rational. But here all distances are integers, so the set is *integral distance set* on line ⇒ points can be taken as integers (since on line, fix $ a_1 = 0 $, $ a_2 = d_{12} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ $, then $ a_3 $ must satisfy $ |a_3|, |a_3 - a_2| \\in \\mathbb{Z} $ ⇒ $ a_3 $ integer, etc.). So WLOG, assume $ a_i $ are integers.\n\nThus, problem reduces to: does there exist an $ n $-element subset of $ \\mathbb{Z} $ whose pairwise distances are exactly $ \\{1,2,\\dots,\\binom{n}{2}\\} $?\n\nThis is equivalent to asking whether there is a set of $ n $ integers with difference set equal to initial segment of naturals.\n\nKnown in combinatorics: Such sets are called *convex* or *interval distance sets*. It's known that maximum size is 4. Reference: \"A note on the distance set problem\" — but let’s reason.\n\nFor $ n = 5 $, need 10 distances: 1 through 10.\n\nThe largest distance is $ \\max - \\min = 10 $. So wlog, $ a_1 = 0, a_5 = 10 $. Then other points $ a_2,a_3,a_4 \\in (0,10) $.\n\nDistances from 0: $ a_2,a_3,a_4,10 $ → must be four of {1,…,10}\n\nDistances from 10: $ 10-a_2,10-a_3,10-a_4,0 $ → but 0 excluded (i<j only), so $ 10-a_2 $ etc. So the set $ \\{a_2,a_3,a_4,10\\} $ and $ \\{10-a_2,10-a_3,10-a_4\\} $ must together cover 1–10 without overlap except possibly.\n\nNote symmetry: if $ d $ is a distance, so is $ 10-d $, unless $ d=5 $. So distances come in pairs summing to 10, except possibly 5.\n\nIn {1,…,10}, pairs: (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), and 5,10. Wait 10 is the max, and 10 only appears once — as $ a_5 - a_1 $. So 10 is unpaired. Then remaining 1–9 must be covered by other distances.\n\nBut number of distances involving endpoint 0 or 10: from 0: 4 distances (to each of 4 others); from 10: 4 distances (to each of first 4); but $ a_5 - a_1 = 10 $ counted in both? No — only once. Actually, total distances = 10. Among them:\n\n- Distances involving $ a_1 = 0 $: $ a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 = 10 $ → 4 values\n- Distances involving $ a_5 = 10 $: $ 10-a_2, 10-a_3, 10-a_4 $, and $ 10-a_1 = 10 $ → but $ 10-a_1 $ already counted, so 3 new ones.\n\nSo total unique distances from endpoints: up to 4 + 3 = 7, plus internal distances among $ a_2,a_3,a_4 $: $ \\binom{3}{2} = 3 $.\n\nSo indeed 4 + 3 + 3 = 10.\n\nNow, the 3 internal distances are $ |a_3-a_2|, |a_4-a_3|, |a_4-a_2| $, all < 10.\n\nTo get distance 1, some adjacent pair must differ by 1.\n\nSimilarly, to get 2, etc.\n\nBut crucial known result: The only $ n $ for which such a set exists are $ n = 2,3,4 $. For $ n = 5 $, impossible. (See e.g., problem from Putnam or IMO shortlist — \"real numbers with consecutive differences\".)\n\nThus, natural numbers $ n \\ge 2 $ satisfying condition: $ n = 2,3,4 $. So count $ N = 3 $.\n\nBut wait — reread problem statement:\n\n> Instead of determining all natural numbers $ n $ for which there exist real numbers satisfying the given condition on absolute differences, simply find $ k = N + 40 $, where $ N $ is the number of distinct absolute differences required for the configuration with five real numbers derived from the structural consideration of the pairwise differences in the problem setup.\n\nHold on! The problem says:\n\n> \"Instead of determining all natural numbers $ n $ [...] simply find $ k = N + 40 $, where $ N $ is the number of distinct absolute differences required for the configuration with five real numbers derived from the structural consideration of the pairwise differences in the problem setup.\"\n\nSo now it's shifting: forget finding all $ n $; instead, consider $ n = 5 $, and compute $ N = $ number of distinct absolute differences *required*, i.e., $ \\binom{5}{2} = 10 $. Because for five numbers, number of unordered pairs is 10, so you need 10 distinct absolute differences — that’s the minimal number required to even hope to fill {1,2,…,10}. So $ N = \\binom{5}{2} = 10 $. Then $ k = N + 40 = 50 $.\n\nBut let's confirm wording:\n\n> \"N is the number of distinct absolute differences required for the configuration with five real numbers derived from the structural consideration of the pairwise differences\"\n\nYes — for 5 numbers, there are $ \\binom{5}{2} = 10 $ pairs, hence 10 absolute differences. To satisfy the equality in the set, you need exactly those 10 values to be distinct and cover 1 through 10 — so *required* number of distinct differences is 10.\n\nHence $ N = 10 $, $ k = 50 $.\n\nSo answer to Problem 1 is **50**.\n\nWait — but the problem says \"Find the minimum possible value of $ n $\" in the middle? Let's reread entire Problem 1 statement carefully.\n\nActually, the user pasted two separate problems, but the formatting is messy. Let me re-extract:\n\n> Problem 1: Find all natural numbers $ n (n \\geq 2) $ such that there exists reals $ a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n $ which satisfy [...]  \n> Let $ A=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}, B=\\{7,8,9,\\dots,n\\} $. $ A_i(i=1,2,\\dots,20) $ contains eight numbers, three of which are chosen from $ A $ and the other five numbers from $ B $. $ |A_i \\cap A_j|\\leq 2, 1\\leq i<j\\leq 20 $. Find the minimum possible value of $ n $. Instead of determining all natural numbers $ n $ for which there exist real numbers satisfying the given condition on absolute differences, simply find $ k = N + 40 $, where $ N $ is the number of distinct absolute differences required for the configuration with five real numbers derived from the structural consideration of the pairwise differences in the problem setup.\n\nThis is confusing — it seems like two unrelated Problem 1 subparts? Or is it a single problem with a red herring?\n\nWait — likely, the user intended:\n\n- First paragraph: classic distance set problem.\n\n- Second paragraph: a completely different combinatorial design problem about families of 8-element sets with intersection ≤ 2, 3 from A={1..6}, 5 from B={7..n}, 20 such sets, minimize n.\n\n- Then a sentence saying: \"Instead of determining all natural numbers n [...] simply find k = N + 40...\", i.e., ignore the first part and the second part, and just compute k based on n=5.\n\nBut why mention the set system? Perhaps it's a distractor, or perhaps the \"structural consideration\" refers to that set system? Unlikely.\n\nLet’s read again:\n\n> Let $ A=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}, B=\\{7,8,9,\\dots,n\\} $. $ A_i(i=1,2,\\dots,20) $ contains eight numbers, three of which are chosen from $ A $ and the other five numbers from $ B $. $ |A_i \\cap A_j|\\leq 2, 1\\leq i<j\\leq 20 $. Find the minimum possible value of $ n $.\n\nThis is a standard extremal set theory problem: family of 20 subsets, each of size 8, with 3 elements from a 6-element set A, 5 from B (size unknown, say $ m = n-6 $), and pairwise intersections at most 2.\n\nWe need to minimize $ n $, i.e., minimize $ |B| = m $, such that such a family exists.\n\nEach $ A_i = X_i \\cup Y_i $, where $ X_i \\subseteq A, |X_i|=3 $, $ Y_i \\subseteq B, |Y_i|=5 $.\n\nConstraint: $ |A_i \\cap A_j| \\le 2 $. Since $ A $ and $ B $ are disjoint, $ |A_i \\cap A_j| = |X_i \\cap X_j| + |Y_i \\cap Y_j| \\le 2 $.\n\nSo for any $ i \\ne j $, $ |X_i \\cap X_j| + |Y_i \\cap Y_j| \\le 2 $.\n\nNote $ |X_i \\cap X_j| \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\} $, but since $ |X_i| = |X_j| = 3 $, max intersection 3, but sum must be ≤ 2, so possibilities:\n\n- If $ |X_i \\cap X_j| = 0 $, then $ |Y_i \\cap Y_j| \\le 2 $\n- If $ |X_i \\cap X_j| = 1 $, then $ |Y_i \\cap Y_j| \\le 1 $\n- If $ |X_i \\cap X_j| = 2 $, then $ |Y_i \\cap Y_j| = 0 $\n- $ |X_i \\cap X_j| = 3 $ implies $ X_i = X_j $, then need $ |Y_i \\cap Y_j| \\le 2 $, but if many $ A_i $ share same $ X_i $, their $ Y_i $ must be 5-subsets of B with pairwise intersection ≤ 2.\n\nHow many 3-subsets of A? $ \\binom{6}{3} = 20 $. Exactly 20! And we need 20 sets $ A_i $. So likely, each $ X_i $ is a distinct 3-subset of A. So $ X_1,\\dots,X_{20} $ = all $ \\binom{6}{3} = 20 $ triples from A.\n\nThen for any $ i \\ne j $, $ |X_i \\cap X_j| $ can be 0,1, or 2 (never 3 since all distinct).\n\nWhat is max possible $ |X_i \\cap X_j| $ for distinct 3-sets? 2 (e.g., {1,2,3} and {1,2,4}).\n\nSo to satisfy $ |X_i \\cap X_j| + |Y_i \\cap Y_j| \\le 2 $, when $ |X_i \\cap X_j| = 2 $, need $ |Y_i \\cap Y_j| = 0 $, i.e., disjoint 5-sets.\n\nWhen $ |X_i \\cap X_j| = 1 $, need $ |Y_i \\cap Y_j| \\le 1 $.\n\nWhen $ |X_i \\cap X_j| = 0 $, need $ |Y_i \\cap Y_j| \\le 2 $.\n\nSo the $ Y_i $'s must be 5-element subsets of B, indexed by 3-subsets of A, with intersection constraints depending on intersection of their X's.\n\nThis resembles a code or design where the \"inner product\" or intersection is controlled.\n\nTo minimize $ |B| = m $, we want to pack as many 5-subsets as possible under these constraints.\n\nBut the problem asks for minimum $ n = 6 + m $.\n\nHowever, the instruction says: \"Instead of determining all natural numbers $ n $ [...] simply find $ k = N + 40 $, where $ N $ is the number of distinct absolute differences required for the configuration with five real numbers...\"\n\nSo regardless of the set system, we are told to ignore it and compute $ N = \\binom{5}{2} = 10 $, so $ k = 50 $.\n\nThus, answer_1 = 50.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\nSolve the system:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx^3 = 3x - 12y + 50, \\\\\ny^3 = 12y + 3z - 2, \\\\\nz^3 = 27z + 27x.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWe seek real solutions $ (x,y,z) $.\n\nLet’s rearrange each equation:\n\n1. $ x^3 - 3x + 12y = 50 $ → $ 12y = 50 - x^3 + 3x $ → $ y = \\frac{50 - x^3 + 3x}{12} $\n\n2. $ y^3 - 12y - 3z = -2 $ → $ 3z = y^3 - 12y + 2 $ → $ z = \\frac{y^3 - 12y + 2}{3} $\n\n3. $ z^3 - 27z - 27x = 0 $ → $ z^3 - 27z = 27x $ → $ x = \\frac{z^3 - 27z}{27} = \\frac{z(z^2 - 27)}{27} $\n\nSo we have cyclic dependencies.\n\nTry to find integer solutions first.\n\nAssume $ x,y,z $ integers.\n\nFrom equation 3: $ z^3 - 27z = 27x \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{z(z-3\\sqrt{3})(z+3\\sqrt{3})}{27} $, but better: factor $ z^3 - 27z = z(z^2 - 27) $. For x integer, RHS must be divisible by 27.\n\nTry small integer z:\n\n- $ z = 0 $: $ x = 0 $. Then from eq2: $ y^3 - 12y + 2 = 0 $. Try y=1: 1-12+2 = -9 ≠0. y=2: 8-24+2=-14. y=3:27-36+2=-7. y=4:64-48+2=18. No.\n\n- $ z = 3 $: $ z^3 - 27z = 27 - 81 = -54 $, so $ x = -54/27 = -2 $.\n\nThen eq1: $ x = -2 $, so $ (-2)^3 = -8 = 3(-2) -12y +50 = -6 -12y +50 = 44 -12y $. So $ -8 = 44 -12y \\Rightarrow 12y = 52 \\Rightarrow y = 13/3 \\approx 4.333 $. Not integer, but maybe ok.\n\nThen check eq2: $ y = 13/3 $, compute $ y^3 = 2197/27 $, $ 12y = 52 $, so $ y^3 -12y +2 = 2197/27 - 52 + 2 = 2197/27 - 50 = (2197 - 1350)/27 = 847/27 $. Then $ z = (y^3 -12y +2)/3 = (847/27)/3 = 847/81 \\approx 10.46 $, but we assumed z=3. Contradiction.\n\nTry $ z = 6 $: $ z^3 -27z = 216 - 162 = 54 $, so $ x = 54/27 = 2 $.\n\nThen eq1: $ x = 2 $, $ x^3 = 8 = 3(2) -12y +50 = 6 -12y +50 = 56 -12y \\Rightarrow 12y = 56 - 8 = 48 \\Rightarrow y = 4 $.\n\nGreat! y = 4.\n\nNow eq2: $ y = 4 $, $ y^3 = 64 $, $ 12y = 48 $, so $ y^3 -12y +2 = 64 - 48 + 2 = 18 $, so $ z = 18 / 3 = 6 $. Consistent!\n\nSo $ (x,y,z) = (2,4,6) $ is a solution.\n\nCheck all equations:\n\n1. $ x^3 = 8 $, RHS: $ 3x -12y +50 = 6 - 48 + 50 = 8 $. ✓  \n2. $ y^3 = 64 $, RHS: $ 12y + 3z -2 = 48 + 18 -2 = 64 $. ✓  \n3. $ z^3 = 216 $, RHS: $ 27z + 27x = 162 + 54 = 216 $. ✓  \n\nSo (2,4,6) works.\n\nAre there other real solutions?\n\nConsider subtracting shifted versions or looking at monotonicity.\n\nDefine functions:\n\nFrom eq1: $ y = \\frac{50 + 3x - x^3}{12} $. This is a decreasing cubic in x (since $ -x^3 $ dominates), so y is strictly decreasing in x.\n\nFrom eq2: $ z = \\frac{y^3 -12y +2}{3} $. Let $ f(y) = \\frac{y^3 -12y +2}{3} $. Derivative $ f'(y) = \\frac{3y^2 -12}{3} = y^2 - 4 $, so decreasing on (-2,2), increasing elsewhere.\n\nFrom eq3: $ x = \\frac{z^3 -27z}{27} = \\frac{z(z^2 - 27)}{27} $. Let $ g(z) = \\frac{z^3 -27z}{27} $, derivative $ g'(z) = \\frac{3z^2 -27}{27} = \\frac{z^2 -9}{9} $, so decreasing on (-3,3), increasing elsewhere.\n\nBut we found one solution. To check uniqueness, consider the composition $ x \\mapsto y \\mapsto z \\mapsto x $, i.e., define $ h(x) = g(f(\\frac{50 + 3x - x^3}{12})) $. Then fixed points of h are solutions.\n\nBut rather than analyze fully, note that the system is quite rigid, and often such olympiad systems have unique real solution.\n\nTry to see if others exist.\n\nSuppose we try $ x = 2 + a $, $ y = 4 + b $, $ z = 6 + c $, small perturbations.\n\nPlug into eq1: $ (2+a)^3 = 3(2+a) -12(4+b) +50 $\n\nLHS: $ 8 + 12a + 6a^2 + a^3 $\n\nRHS: $ 6 + 3a -48 -12b +50 = 8 + 3a -12b $\n\nSo $ 8 + 12a + 6a^2 + a^3 = 8 + 3a -12b \\Rightarrow 9a + 6a^2 + a^3 = -12b \\Rightarrow b = -\\frac{9a + 6a^2 + a^3}{12} $\n\nSimilarly, eq2: $ (4+b)^3 = 12(4+b) + 3(6+c) -2 = 48 + 12b + 18 + 3c -2 = 64 + 12b + 3c $\n\nLHS: $ 64 + 48b + 12b^2 + b^3 $\n\nSo $ 64 + 48b + 12b^2 + b^3 = 64 + 12b + 3c \\Rightarrow 36b + 12b^2 + b^3 = 3c \\Rightarrow c = 12b + 4b^2 + \\frac{b^3}{3} $\n\nEq3: $ (6+c)^3 = 27(6+c) + 27(2+a) = 162 + 27c + 54 + 27a = 216 + 27c + 27a $\n\nLHS: $ 216 + 108c + 18c^2 + c^3 $\n\nSo $ 216 + 108c + 18c^2 + c^3 = 216 + 27c + 27a \\Rightarrow 81c + 18c^2 + c^3 = 27a \\Rightarrow a = 3c + \\frac{2}{3}c^2 + \\frac{c^3}{27} $\n\nNow substitute step by step.\n\nFrom first: $ b = -\\frac{9a + 6a^2 + a^3}{12} $\n\nIf $ a $ small, $ b \\approx -\\frac{9a}{12} = -\\frac{3a}{4} $\n\nThen $ c \\approx 12b = 12(-3a/4) = -9a $\n\nThen $ a \\approx 3c = 3(-9a) = -27a \\Rightarrow a + 27a = 0 \\Rightarrow 28a = 0 \\Rightarrow a = 0 $\n\nSo only solution near (2,4,6) is itself. Given monotonicity in parts, likely unique.\n\nAlso, check behavior at infinity: as $ x \\to \\infty $, $ y \\sim -x^3/12 \\to -\\infty $, then $ z \\sim y^3/3 \\to -\\infty $, then $ x = (z^3 -27z)/27 \\sim z^3/27 \\to -\\infty $, inconsistency unless bounded. So only bounded solution.\n\nThus, unique real solution is $ (2,4,6) $.\n\nAnswer is the triple: $ (2,4,6) $. As per instructions, put in quotes as string? Or as tuple? The problem says \"triples (x,y,z) of real numbers\", and example shows \"Monday\", so likely format as ordered triple in parentheses, space-separated? But JSON value must be exact text.\n\nLooking at instruction: \"For text answers, provide the exact text\". So probably \"(2, 4, 6)\" or \"(2,4,6)\". Since no specification, safest is \"(2,4,6)\".\n\nBut check if other solutions exist. Try $ z = -3 $: $ z^3 -27z = -27 + 81 = 54 $, $ x = 2 $ again. Then same as before? No, z=-3 gives x=2, then y from eq1 same: y=4, but then eq2: y=4 gives z=6, contradiction. So no.\n\nThus only solution is (2,4,6).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n- Problem 1: $ k = 50 $\n- Problem 2: $ (2,4,6) $\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The number of distinct absolute differences required for five real numbers is the number of unordered pairs, which is \\\\binom{5}{2} = 10.
