  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve each step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\nWe are to find $ k = T + 14 $, where $ T $ is the constant satisfying:\n\n$$\nP^2 + Q^2 + 1 = P Q T\n$$\n\nfor monic complex polynomials $ P(x), Q(x) $ such that:\n\n- $ P \\mid Q^2 + 1 $\n- $ Q \\mid P^2 + 1 $\n\nWe are *not* asked to find all such pairs, but rather to find the constant $ T $ (presumably same for all such nontrivial pairs satisfying the identity), then compute $ k = T + 14 $.\n\nLet’s analyze.\n\nLet $ P $ and $ Q $ be monic complex polynomials satisfying:\n\n1. $ Q^2 + 1 = P \\cdot A $ for some polynomial $ A $\n2. $ P^2 + 1 = Q \\cdot B $ for some polynomial $ B $\n\nAlso, we’re told that $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 = P Q T $, i.e., the left-hand side is divisible by both $ P $ and $ Q $, and the quotient is constant $ T $. So $ PQ $ divides $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 $, and the quotient is constant.\n\nThat suggests degrees match: $ \\deg(P^2 + Q^2 + 1) = \\deg(P) + \\deg(Q) $, since RHS degree is $ \\deg(P) + \\deg(Q) $, and LHS degree is $ \\max(2\\deg P, 2\\deg Q) $, unless degrees are equal.\n\nSo suppose $ \\deg P = \\deg Q = d $. Since both are monic, leading term of $ P^2 $ is $ x^{2d} $, same for $ Q^2 $, so $ P^2 + Q^2 $ has leading term $ 2x^{2d} $, unless $ d = 0 $.\n\nBut if $ d = 0 $, then $ P = Q = 1 $ (monic constant polynomials). Check:\n\n- $ P = 1 $, $ Q = 1 $: does $ 1 \\mid 1^2 + 1 = 2 $? Yes. And $ 1 \\mid 1^2 + 1 = 2 $. So OK.\n\nThen $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 $, and $ PQ = 1 $, so $ T = 3 $. Then $ k = 3 + 14 = 17 $. But is this the only possibility? Probably not — maybe there are nonconstant solutions, and $ T $ is fixed across all such pairs.\n\nTry low-degree candidates.\n\n#### Try linear monic polynomials.\n\nLet $ P(x) = x - a $, $ Q(x) = x - b $, with $ a,b \\in \\mathbb{C} $.\n\nCondition: $ P \\mid Q^2 + 1 $ means $ Q(a)^2 + 1 = 0 $, i.e., $ (a - b)^2 + 1 = 0 $ → $ (a - b)^2 = -1 $ → $ a - b = \\pm i $.\n\nSimilarly, $ Q \\mid P^2 + 1 $ ⇒ $ P(b)^2 + 1 = 0 $ ⇒ $ (b - a)^2 + 1 = 0 $, same condition. So consistent.\n\nSo any pair of linear monic polynomials whose roots differ by $ \\pm i $ works.\n\nSo pick simplest: let $ a = 0 $, so $ P(x) = x $, then $ b = \\pm i $. Take $ b = i $, so $ Q(x) = x - i $.\n\nCheck:\n\n- $ Q^2 + 1 = (x - i)^2 + 1 = x^2 - 2ix - 1 + 1 = x^2 - 2ix $. Does $ x $ divide this? Yes: $ x(x - 2i) $. OK.\n\n- $ P^2 + 1 = x^2 + 1 $. Does $ Q = x - i $ divide it? Evaluate at $ x = i $: $ i^2 + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0 $. Yes.\n\nSo $ P(x) = x $, $ Q(x) = x - i $ is a valid pair.\n\nNow compute $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 $:\n\n- $ P^2 = x^2 $\n- $ Q^2 = (x - i)^2 = x^2 - 2ix - 1 $\n- So sum: $ x^2 + (x^2 - 2ix - 1) + 1 = 2x^2 - 2ix $\n\nAnd $ PQ = x(x - i) = x^2 - i x $\n\nWe want $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 = T \\cdot PQ $, i.e.,\n\n$$\n2x^2 - 2i x = T (x^2 - i x)\n$$\n\nFactor RHS: $ T x (x - i) $, LHS: $ 2x(x - i) $. Indeed:\n\n$ 2x^2 - 2i x = 2x(x - i) $, and $ PQ = x(x - i) $, so $ T = 2 $.\n\nSo $ T = 2 $ here.\n\nEarlier with constants $ P = Q = 1 $, we got $ T = 3 $. But problem says “for pairs $ P, Q $ meeting the conditions”, and asks for $ T $ satisfying $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 = P Q T $. But $ T $ is not unique unless further constraints.\n\nWait — perhaps only nonconstant coprime solutions? Or maybe the identity $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 = P Q T $ holds *only* when $ T $ is constant — which forces degrees to match: $ \\deg(P^2 + Q^2 + 1) = \\deg(P) + \\deg(Q) $. For nonconstant $ P,Q $, this only possible if $ \\deg P = \\deg Q = 1 $, because:\n\n- If $ \\deg P = m $, $ \\deg Q = n $, then $ \\deg(P^2) = 2m $, $ \\deg(Q^2) = 2n $, so $ \\deg(LHS) = \\max(2m, 2n) $, assuming no cancellation.\n- $ \\deg(RHS) = m + n $.\n\nSo need $ \\max(2m, 2n) = m + n $. WLOG assume $ m \\ge n $. Then $ 2m = m + n \\Rightarrow m = n $. So $ m = n $, and $ 2m = 2m $, OK. So degrees must be equal.\n\nSo $ \\deg P = \\deg Q = d $, and $ 2d = 2d $, fine. But for $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 = PQ T $ to hold with constant $ T $, the polynomials must be proportional: $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 $ must be a constant multiple of $ PQ $. That’s a strong condition.\n\nLet’s suppose $ P $ and $ Q $ are monic of degree $ d $. Then leading term of $ P^2 $ is $ x^{2d} $, same for $ Q^2 $, so $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 $ has leading term $ 2x^{2d} $ (unless $ P = \\omega Q $ with $ \\omega^2 = -1 $, causing cancellation).\n\nIf $ P = i Q $, then $ P^2 = -Q^2 $, so $ P^2 + Q^2 = 0 $, then LHS = 1, but RHS = $ i Q^2 T $, degree $ 2d $, can’t equal constant unless $ d = 0 $. So no.\n\nThus generally, leading coefficient of LHS is 2, of RHS is $ T \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = T $, and degree of RHS is $ 2d $, same as LHS, so comparing leading coefficients: $ 2 = T $. So $ T = 2 $.\n\nIndeed, in our linear example, $ T = 2 $. In constant case $ P = Q = 1 $, LHS = 3, RHS = $ 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot T = T $, so $ T = 3 $, but degree condition fails: $ \\deg(PQ) = 0 $, $ \\deg(LHS) = 0 $, still OK, but it's a special case.\n\nHowever, problem says “instead of determining all such pairs … simply find $ k = T + 14 $, where $ T $ is the constant satisfying $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 = P Q T $ for pairs $ P, Q $ meeting the conditions.”\n\nIt implies that $ T $ is uniquely determined — so likely they have in mind nonconstant solutions, or the generic case. Also, constant polynomials: $ P = 1 $, $ Q = 1 $ works, but also $ P = 1 $, $ Q $ any monic polynomial dividing $ 1^2 + 1 = 2 $, i.e., $ Q $ divides 2 ⇒ $ Q $ constant, so $ Q = 1 $ or $ Q = 2 $, but must be monic ⇒ $ Q = 1 $. So only constant pair is $ (1,1) $.\n\nBut maybe there's a well-known identity here.\n\nThis looks similar to the Markov equation or Euclid’s algorithm for polynomials.\n\nRecall: If $ P \\mid Q^2 + 1 $ and $ Q \\mid P^2 + 1 $, then consider resultants or use symmetry.\n\nSuppose $ P $ and $ Q $ satisfy $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 = c P Q $. This is analogous to the Markov equation $ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz $, but here $ z = 1 $, and coefficient is $ T $.\n\nIn number theory, integer solutions to $ x^2 + y^2 + 1 = T x y $ are studied; minimal solution is $ x = y = 1 $ gives $ 1 + 1 + 1 = T \\cdot 1 \\Rightarrow T = 3 $. Next, $ x = 1, y = 2 $: $ 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 = T \\cdot 2 \\Rightarrow T = 3 $. Wait: $ 6/2 = 3 $. Try $ x = 2, y = 5 $: $ 4 + 25 + 1 = 30 = T \\cdot 10 \\Rightarrow T = 3 $. Indeed, the Diophantine equation $ x^2 + y^2 + 1 = 3xy $ has infinitely many solutions (Markov-type), e.g., (1,1), (1,2), (2,5), etc.\n\nSo perhaps $ T = 3 $ is forced.\n\nBut earlier with polynomials $ P = x $, $ Q = x - i $, we got $ T = 2 $. Let's double-check that computation.\n\n$ P(x) = x $, $ Q(x) = x - i $\n\n- $ P^2 = x^2 $\n- $ Q^2 = (x - i)^2 = x^2 - 2 i x + i^2 = x^2 - 2 i x - 1 $\n- So $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 = x^2 + (x^2 - 2 i x - 1) + 1 = 2x^2 - 2 i x $\n\n- $ P Q = x(x - i) = x^2 - i x $\n\nNow, is $ 2x^2 - 2 i x = T (x^2 - i x) $?\n\nYes: factor LHS = $ 2x(x - i) $, RHS = $ T x(x - i) $, so $ T = 2 $. Correct.\n\nSo $ T = 2 $ for this pair.\n\nBut does this pair satisfy the original divisibility conditions fully?\n\n- $ P \\mid Q^2 + 1 $: $ Q^2 + 1 = (x - i)^2 + 1 = x^2 - 2 i x - 1 + 1 = x^2 - 2 i x = x(x - 2i) $, divisible by $ x $. OK.\n\n- $ Q \\mid P^2 + 1 = x^2 + 1 $. Since $ Q(x) = x - i $, evaluate at $ x = i $: $ i^2 + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0 $. So yes.\n\nSo it's a valid pair with $ T = 2 $.\n\nBut problem says “find $ k = T + 14 $, where $ T $ is the constant satisfying $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 = P Q T $ for pairs $ P, Q $ meeting the conditions.” It doesn’t say “for all such pairs”, but “the constant $ T $” — implying uniqueness.\n\nPerhaps only when $ P $ and $ Q $ are coprime and nonconstant, $ T $ is always 2? Or maybe the problem expects the answer from the standard solution.\n\nAlternatively, suppose $ P $ and $ Q $ are both degree 1, monic: $ P = x - a $, $ Q = x - b $. Then as before, conditions give $ (a - b)^2 = -1 $.\n\nCompute $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 $:\n\n- $ (x - a)^2 + (x - b)^2 + 1 = 2x^2 - 2(a + b)x + (a^2 + b^2) + 1 $\n\n- $ PQ = (x - a)(x - b) = x^2 - (a + b)x + ab $\n\nWe want $ 2x^2 - 2(a + b)x + (a^2 + b^2 + 1) = T [x^2 - (a + b)x + ab] $\n\nMatch coefficients:\n\n- $ x^2 $: $ 2 = T $\n- $ x $: $ -2(a + b) = -T(a + b) \\Rightarrow -2(a + b) = -2(a + b) $, OK.\n- Constant: $ a^2 + b^2 + 1 = T ab = 2ab $\n\nSo need $ a^2 + b^2 + 1 = 2ab \\Rightarrow (a - b)^2 = -1 $, which matches our earlier condition! Because $ a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = -1 \\Rightarrow (a - b)^2 = -1 $. So consistent.\n\nThus for all linear monic solutions, $ T = 2 $.\n\nFor constant solution $ P = Q = 1 $, $ T = 3 $, but perhaps the problem intends nonconstant, or the generic case. Since the problem says “determine all pairs … instead … simply find $ k = T + 14 $”, and given that linear solutions exist and yield $ T = 2 $, and it's the only $ T $ that works for nonconstant polynomials (as shown by leading coefficient argument: leading term of $ P^2 + Q^2 $ is $ 2x^{2d} $, of $ PQ $ is $ x^{2d} $, so $ T = 2 $), then $ T = 2 $.\n\nHence $ k = 2 + 14 = 16 $.\n\nWait, but let's test quadratic? Suppose $ \\deg P = \\deg Q = 2 $, monic.\n\nLet $ P = x^2 + ax + b $, $ Q = x^2 + cx + d $. Then $ P^2 + Q^2 + 1 $ has leading term $ 2x^4 $, $ PQ = x^4 + \\dots $, so again leading coefficient comparison gives $ T = 2 $. So regardless of degree, as long as degrees equal and monic, $ T = 2 $.\n\nThus $ T = 2 $, $ k = 16 $.\n\nSo answer to Problem 1 is **16**.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n16 students, each answers multiple-choice problems with 4 choices per problem. Any two students have **at most one answer in common** — meaning, for any two distinct students, the number of problems on which they selected the same choice is ≤ 1.\n\nWe are to find the **maximum number of problems**, say $ m $.\n\nThis is a combinatorial design problem.\n\nModel each student as a vector in $ [4]^m $, i.e., length-$ m $ strings over alphabet size 4.\n\nCondition: for any two distinct vectors $ u, v $, the number of coordinates where they agree is at most 1.\n\nWe want maximum $ m $ given $ n = 16 $ vectors.\n\nThis is related to coding theory: constant weight? No, not weight, but Hamming correlation.\n\nDefine agreement number: $ \\operatorname{agr}(u,v) = |\\{i : u_i = v_i\\}| \\le 1 $ for $ u \\ne v $.\n\nWe want largest $ m $ such that there exists a code of size 16 over alphabet $ \\mathbb{F}_4 $ (or just size-4 alphabet) with pairwise agreement ≤ 1.\n\nEquivalently, the Hamming distance $ d(u,v) = m - \\operatorname{agr}(u,v) \\ge m - 1 $.\n\nSo minimum Hamming distance $ d_{\\min} \\ge m - 1 $.\n\nSo we have a code of length $ m $, size $ 16 $, over alphabet size $ q = 4 $, with $ d_{\\min} \\ge m - 1 $.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible $ m $?\n\nUse bounds, e.g., Plotkin bound, or pigeonhole.\n\nAlternative approach: For each problem, the 16 students choose among 4 options. By pigeonhole, some option is chosen by at least $ \\lceil 16/4 \\rceil = 4 $ students.\n\nBut we need global constraint.\n\nLet’s count total number of (student pair, problem) where the two students agree on that problem.\n\nThere are $ \\binom{16}{2} = 120 $ pairs of students.\n\nFor each pair, they agree on at most 1 problem, so total number of such agreeing incidences is at most $ 120 \\times 1 = 120 $.\n\nOn the other hand, for each problem, count how many pairs agree on it.\n\nFor a single problem, suppose the 16 students' answers are distributed among 4 choices. Let $ a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 $ be the numbers choosing each option, with $ \\sum a_i = 16 $.\n\nNumber of pairs agreeing on this problem is $ \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\binom{a_i}{2} $.\n\nWe want to maximize total agreements over all problems, but we have an upper bound of 120.\n\nTo get an upper bound on $ m $, we need a lower bound on agreements per problem, because total agreements = sum over problems of agreements on that problem ≤ 120.\n\nSo if we can find the *minimum possible* number of agreeing pairs on a single problem, given 16 students and 4 choices, then $ m \\times (\\text{min agreements per problem}) \\le 120 $.\n\nBut we want maximum $ m $, so we need the *smallest possible* number of agreeing pairs per problem, because that would allow more problems within the 120 limit.\n\nWhat’s the minimal value of $ \\sum \\binom{a_i}{2} $ subject to $ \\sum a_i = 16 $, $ a_i \\ge 0 $ integer?\n\nThis sum is minimized when the $ a_i $ are as equal as possible, by convexity of $ \\binom{x}{2} $.\n\n16 divided by 4 is exactly 4. So $ a_i = 4 $ for all $ i $.\n\nThen $ \\sum \\binom{4}{2} = 4 \\times 6 = 24 $.\n\nSo on each problem, at least 24 pairs agree (if distribution is perfectly balanced), and in any case, ≥ 24.\n\nIs 24 the minimum? Yes, because $ \\binom{a}{2} $ is convex, so by Jensen, minimized at equal distribution.\n\nThus for each problem, number of agreeing pairs ≥ 24.\n\nTherefore, total agreeing incidences ≥ $ 24 m $.\n\nBut total agreeing incidences ≤ 120.\n\nSo $ 24 m \\le 120 \\Rightarrow m \\le 5 $.\n\nSo maximum $ m = 5 $.\n\nCan $ m = 5 $ be achieved?\n\nWe need to arrange 16 students, 5 problems, 4 choices, such that every pair agrees on at most one problem.\n\nWith $ m = 5 $, total possible agreements allowed = 120, and minimum per problem is 24, and $ 5 \\times 24 = 120 $, so we must have *exactly* 24 agreeing pairs per problem, which requires that on each problem, exactly 4 students choose each option.\n\nSo the answer distribution per problem is uniform: 4 per choice.\n\nNow, is there a set of 16 vectors in $ [4]^5 $ such that:\n\n- Each coordinate has each symbol exactly 4 times (so it's a kind of orthogonal array), and\n- Any two distinct vectors agree in at most one coordinate.\n\nThis is equivalent to an Orthogonal Array OA(16, 5, 4, 2), where strength 2 means that in any two columns, all $ 4^2 = 16 $ ordered pairs appear equally often. For an OA with $ N $ rows, $ k $ columns, $ s $ symbols, strength $ t $, we need $ N = \\lambda s^t $.\n\nHere, if we want that any two rows agree in at most one column, that's related to the concept of a code with maximum correlation 1.\n\nAn OA of strength 2 with $ s = 4 $, $ k = 5 $, would have $ N $ multiple of $ 4^2 = 16 $, smallest is $ N = 16 $, giving $ \\lambda = 1 $. Indeed, an OA(16, 5, 4, 2) exists? The Rao bound says for OA(N, k, s, t), $ N \\ge s^t + (k - t)(s - 1) $, but here $ t = 2 $, $ s = 4 $, $ k = 5 $, $ s^t = 16 $, so $ N \\ge 16 $, so $ N = 16 $ is possible only if it's tight.\n\nIn fact, finite geometry: the affine geometry AG(2,4) has $ 4^2 = 16 $ points. Lines have 4 points. But perhaps use dual.\n\nStandard construction: the set of all vectors in $ \\mathbb{F}_4^2 $ has 16 elements. Consider evaluation of linear functions? Or use characters.\n\nActually, known result: maximum size of a code of length $ m $ over alphabet size $ q $ with pairwise intersection (agreement) at most $ \\lambda $ is bounded; here $ \\lambda = 1 $, $ q = 4 $, $ n = 16 $.\n\nThe bound we used is tight: $ m \\le 5 $, and equality can be achieved by the set of all $ 4 \\times 4 $ Latin squares? Or more directly, consider the vectors as elements of $ \\mathbb{F}_4^2 $, and define 5 functions (coordinate projections) corresponding to linear forms.\n\nA concrete construction: take all 16 vectors $ (a, b) \\in \\mathbb{F}_4^2 $. Define 5 problems corresponding to the following linear functionals:\n\n- Problem 1: $ f_1(a,b) = a $\n- Problem 2: $ f_2(a,b) = b $\n- Problem 3: $ f_3(a,b) = a + b $\n- Problem 4: $ f_4(a,b) = a + \\omega b $, where $ \\omega $ is primitive element\n- Problem 5: $ f_5(a,b) = a + \\omega^2 b $\n\nSince $ \\mathbb{F}_4 $ has 4 elements, each functional is a surjective linear map from $ \\mathbb{F}_4^2 \\to \\mathbb{F}_4 $, so each takes each value exactly 4 times (since kernel has size 4, image size 4, so fibers size 4). So uniform.\n\nNow, do any two distinct vectors agree on more than one functional? Suppose vectors $ u = (a,b) $, $ v = (c,d) $, $ u \\ne v $. They agree on functional $ f $ if $ f(u) = f(v) $, i.e., $ f(u - v) = 0 $. So for how many $ f_i $ is $ f_i(u - v) = 0 $?\n\nLet $ w = u - v \\ne 0 $. Each $ f_i $ is a nonzero linear functional, so kernel is a hyperplane (1-dimensional subspace of $ \\mathbb{F}_4^2 $), which has size 4. There are $ (4^2 - 1)/(4 - 1) = 5 $ one-dimensional subspaces in $ \\mathbb{F}_4^2 $, since number of lines through origin is $ (q^2 - 1)/(q - 1) = q + 1 = 5 $.\n\nEach nonzero $ w $ lies in exactly one 1-dimensional subspace, i.e., is a scalar multiple of some basis vector. But each kernel is a subspace of dimension 1, and there are 5 such kernels (corresponding to the 5 directions). Since there are exactly 5 one-dimensional subspaces, and each nonzero $ w $ belongs to exactly one of them, then for a fixed $ w \\ne 0 $, the set of linear functionals vanishing on $ w $ corresponds to functionals whose kernel contains $ w $, i.e., kernel is the span of $ w $. Since each 1D subspace is kernel of some functional (up to scalar), and there are 5 such subspaces, there is exactly one functional (up to scalar) with that kernel. But we have 5 functionals, presumably with distinct kernels — the 5 different 1D subspaces.\n\nThus, for any nonzero $ w $, there is exactly one $ f_i $ such that $ f_i(w) = 0 $, i.e., $ u $ and $ v $ agree on exactly one problem.\n\nPerfect! So this construction achieves $ m = 5 $.\n\nThus maximum number of problems is **5**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n- Problem 1: $ k = 16 $\n- Problem 2: $ 5 $\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: For monic complex polynomials P and Q satisfying P | Q²+1 and Q | P²+1, the identity P² + Q² + 1 = PQT implies T is the leading coefficient ratio. Since P and Q are monic of equal degree d, the leading term of P² + Q² is 2x^{2d}, and of PQ is x^{2d}, so T = 2. Thus k = T + 14 = 16. Problem 2: With 16 students and 4 choices per problem, the condition that any two students agree on at most one answer leads to a counting argument: there are C(16,2) = 120 student pairs, each contributing at most 1 agreement, so total agreements ≤ 120. Per problem, the minimum number of agreeing pairs occurs when answers are evenly distributed (4 per choice), giving ΣC(4,2) = 24 agreements per problem. Thus 24m ≤ 120 ⇒ m ≤ 5.
