  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\n> Let $\\{f_n\\}$ be the Fibonacci sequence $\\{1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots\\}$.\n\nNote: This is the standard Fibonacci sequence starting with $f_1 = 1$, $f_2 = 1$, $f_3 = 2$, etc. But the problem says:\n\n> Instead of finding all pairs $(a, b)$ of real numbers such that for each $n$, $a f_n + b f_{n+1}$ is a member of the sequence, simply find $k = f_0 + 1$, where $f_0$ is the preceding term in the Fibonacci sequence derived from the recurrence relation $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ applied at $n=2$.\n\nSo we need to find $f_0$, the term before $f_1$, consistent with the recurrence.\n\nGiven:\n- $f_1 = 1$\n- $f_2 = 1$\n- Recurrence: $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ for $n \\ge 3$\n\nBut it says \"applied at $n = 2$\", i.e., use recurrence for $n = 2$:  \n$f_2 = f_1 + f_0$\n\nWe know $f_2 = 1$, $f_1 = 1$, so:\n\n$$\n1 = 1 + f_0 \\implies f_0 = 0\n$$\n\nThus,\n$$\nk = f_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\n$$\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **1**.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\n> Solve in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ the equation:  \n> $$\nx^2(1 + x^2) = -1 + 21^y\n$$\n\nWe seek integer solutions $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n$$\nx^2(1 + x^2) = x^2 + x^4 = x^4 + x^2\n$$\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n$$\nx^4 + x^2 + 1 = 21^y\n$$\n\nBecause moving $-1$ to left: $x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 21^y$\n\nSo define:\n\n$$\nN(x) = x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 21^y\n$$\n\nWe want integer $x$, integer $y$, such that this holds.\n\nNote: Since RHS is $21^y$, and $21 = 3 \\cdot 7$, it's positive for all integer $y$, and $21^y > 0$. Also, LHS $x^4 + x^2 + 1 \\ge 1$ for all integer $x$, since $x^4, x^2 \\ge 0$, and equality only if $x = 0$: then $0 + 0 + 1 = 1$. So check small $x$.\n\n#### Try $x = 0$:  \nLHS = $0^4 + 0^2 + 1 = 1$ → $21^y = 1 \\implies y = 0$. So $(x, y) = (0, 0)$ is a solution.\n\n#### Try $x = \\pm 1$:  \n$x^4 = 1$, $x^2 = 1$ → $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$ → $21^y = 3$. Not possible (21^y is 1, 21, 441, ...). So no.\n\n#### $x = \\pm 2$:  \n$x^2 = 4$, $x^4 = 16$ → $16 + 4 + 1 = 21$ → $21^y = 21 \\implies y = 1$. So $(x, y) = (\\pm 2, 1)$ are solutions.\n\n#### $x = \\pm 3$:  \n$x^2 = 9$, $x^4 = 81$ → $81 + 9 + 1 = 91$. Is 91 a power of 21? $21^1 = 21$, $21^2 = 441$, so no.\n\n#### $x = \\pm 4$:  \n$x^2 = 16$, $x^4 = 256$ → $256 + 16 + 1 = 273$. Not a power of 21.\n\n#### $x = \\pm 5$:  \n$x^2 = 25$, $x^4 = 625$ → $625 + 25 + 1 = 651$. $21^2 = 441$, $21^3 = 9261$, so no.\n\n#### $x = \\pm 6$:  \n$x^2 = 36$, $x^4 = 1296$ → $1296 + 36 + 1 = 1333$. Still < 441? No, 1333 > 441, but not equal to 441 or 9261.\n\nCheck $21^2 = 441$, $21^3 = 9261$, $21^4 = 194481$, etc.\n\nLet’s see growth:\n\n- $x^4 + x^2 + 1$ grows like $x^4$\n- $21^y$ grows exponentially in $y$\n\nSo maybe only small solutions.\n\nLet’s try $y = 0$: then RHS = 1 → $x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 1 \\implies x^4 + x^2 = 0 \\implies x^2(x^2 + 1) = 0$. Since $x^2 + 1 > 0$ for all real $x$, only solution is $x = 0$. So $(0, 0)$.\n\n$y = 1$: RHS = 21 → $x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 21 \\implies x^4 + x^2 - 20 = 0$. Let $z = x^2$, then $z^2 + z - 20 = 0$. Solve: discriminant $1 + 80 = 81$, so $z = \\frac{-1 \\pm 9}{2} = 4$ or $-5$. Since $z = x^2 \\ge 0$, $z = 4 \\implies x = \\pm 2$. So $(\\pm 2, 1)$.\n\n$y = 2$: RHS = 441 → $x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 441 \\implies x^4 + x^2 - 440 = 0$. Let $z = x^2$: $z^2 + z - 440 = 0$. Discriminant $1 + 1760 = 1761$. Is 1761 a perfect square? $42^2 = 1764$, $41^2 = 1681$, so no. So no integer $z$, thus no integer $x$.\n\n$y = 3$: RHS = 9261 → $x^4 + x^2 = 9260$. Try approximate $x^4 \\approx 9260 \\implies x \\approx \\sqrt[4]{9260}$. $10^4 = 10000$, so $x \\approx 10$. Try $x = 10$: $10^4 + 10^2 = 10000 + 100 = 10100 > 9260$. $x = 9$: $6561 + 81 = 6642$. Too low. $x = 10$ gives 10100, too high. No integer solution.\n\n$y = -1$: RHS = $21^{-1} = \\frac{1}{21}$, not integer, but LHS is integer, so impossible. So $y$ must be non-negative integer.\n\nThus only possible $y = 0, 1, 2, 3,...$, but only $y = 0, 1$ give solutions.\n\nAlso check $x = \\pm 1$ again: gives 3, not power of 21.\n\nWhat about $x = \\pm 7$: $x^2 = 49$, $x^4 = 2401$, sum = $2401 + 49 + 1 = 2451$. $21^3 = 9261$, too big; $21^2 = 441$, too small.\n\nSo only solutions are:\n\n- $(x, y) = (0, 0)$\n- $(x, y) = (2, 1)$\n- $(x, y) = (-2, 1)$\n\nAre there any others? Let's consider modulo constraints to prove finiteness.\n\nObserve modulo small numbers.\n\nNote: $x^4 + x^2 + 1 = \\frac{x^6 - 1}{x^2 - 1}$ for $x^2 \\ne 1$, but maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that for $|x| \\ge 3$, $x^4 + x^2 + 1$ lies strictly between consecutive powers of 21? Not necessarily, but growth rates differ.\n\nBut since problem asks to \"solve in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$\", i.e., find all integer pairs, and we found three: $(0,0), (2,1), (-2,1)$.\n\nWait — does the original equation allow negative $y$? Let's double-check original:\n\n$$\nx^2(1 + x^2) = -1 + 21^y\n$$\n\nIf $y < 0$, RHS is fractional (since $21^y = 1/21^{|y|}$), while LHS is integer ≥ 0. So RHS would be $-1 + \\text{fraction} \\in (-1, 0)$, but LHS is ≥ 0, so impossible. So $y \\ge 0$.\n\nAlso, $x$ can be any integer, positive, negative, or zero. Since $x^2$ appears, $x$ and $-x$ give same LHS, so symmetric.\n\nThus full solution set is:\n\n$$\n\\{(0, 0), (2, 1), (-2, 1)\\}\n$$\n\nBut the problem says \"Solve in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$\", i.e., list all integer solutions. However, the answer format expects a single value — but looking back at instructions:\n\n> After your reasoning, provide your final answers in the exact JSON format specified below.\n\nAnd the example shows `\"answer_1\": \"42\"`, `\"answer_2\": \"Monday\"` — so likely expects a single value per problem.\n\nBut Problem 2 asks to \"solve\", i.e., find all integer solutions. How to represent that?\n\nPossibility: list as a set of tuples, but JSON requires string? Or perhaps count? But instruction says \"put ONLY the answer value in the quotes\".\n\nLooking again at Problem 1: it redirected to compute $k = f_0 + 1 = 1$, so answer is scalar.\n\nFor Problem 2, maybe they expect the number of solutions? Or list them in some encoded way?\n\nBut instruction says: \"For text answers, provide the exact text\". So perhaps write the set as a string.\n\nHowever, standard contest practice: if multiple solutions, list them explicitly.\n\nBut JSON doesn’t allow tuples directly in strings unless formatted.\n\nLet’s read problem statement again carefully:\n\n> Solve in $ \\mathbb{Z}^2 $ the equation: $ x^2\\left( 1+x^2 \\right) =-1+21^y. $\n\n\"Solve\" means find all integer pairs $(x,y)$ satisfying it.\n\nSo answer should be those three pairs.\n\nHow to format? Perhaps as a list of strings: `[\"(0, 0)\", \"(2, 1)\", \"(-2, 1)\"]`, but JSON answer field is a single string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect the solutions written in a specific format, e.g., lexicographic order, comma-separated.\n\nBut instruction says: \"no additional text before or after the JSON\", and \"put ONLY the answer value in the quotes\".\n\nLooking at similar problems, sometimes answers are given as sets written in standard notation.\n\nBut safest: since it's a math competition-style problem, and only three solutions, and the problem says \"solve\", likely expects listing them.\n\nHowever, the JSON format shown has `\"answer_1\": \"42\"` — a string containing the answer.\n\nSo for answer_2, we can write a string representing the solution set.\n\nStandard way: $\\{(0,0),(-2,1),(2,1)\\}$ — but using ASCII.\n\nSo: \"{(0, 0), (-2, 1), (2, 1)}\"\n\nBut need to confirm no other solutions.\n\nLet’s double-check $x = \\pm 1$: LHS = $1*(1+1) = 2$, RHS = $-1 + 21^y$, so $21^y = 3$, no.\n\n$x = \\pm 3$: $9*(1+9) = 9*10 = 90$, so $-1 + 21^y = 90 \\implies 21^y = 91$, not power.\n\n$x = \\pm 4$: $16*17 = 272$, $21^y = 273$, not power.\n\n$x = \\pm 5$: $25*26 = 650$, $21^y = 651$, no.\n\n$x = \\pm 6$: $36*37 = 1332$, $21^y = 1333$, no.\n\n$x = \\pm 7$: $49*50 = 2450$, $21^y = 2451$, no.\n\n$x = \\pm 8$: $64*65 = 4160$, $21^y = 4161$. $21^3 = 9261$, too big; $21^2 = 441$, too small.\n\nSo no more.\n\nThus only three solutions.\n\nHence answer_2 is the set {(0, 0), (-2, 1), (2, 1)}.\n\nIn JSON string: \"{(0, 0), (-2, 1), (2, 1)}\"\n\nBut need to ensure no spaces? Usually spaces allowed.\n\nAlternatively, sorted by x: (-2,1), (0,0), (2,1)\n\nYes.\n\nSo final answer_2: \"{(-2, 1), (0, 0), (2, 1)}\"\n\nBut let’s verify original equation for (0,0):  \nLHS: $0^2(1 + 0^2) = 0$  \nRHS: $-1 + 21^0 = -1 + 1 = 0$ ✅\n\nFor (2,1): $4*(1 + 4) = 4*5 = 20$, RHS: $-1 + 21 = 20$ ✅  \nSame for (-2,1): same LHS.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo answer_2 is that set.\n\nNow compile reasoning and answers.\n\n---\n\n### Final JSON:\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The Fibonacci sequence is defined with f_1 = 1, f_2 = 1, and recurrence f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}. Applying the recurrence at n = 2 gives f_2 = f_1 + f_0 => 1 = 1 + f_0 => f_0 = 0. Thus k = f_0 + 1 = 1. Problem 2: Rewrite equation as x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 21^y. Testing small integer x values: x = 0 gives 1 = 21^y => y = 0; x = ±2 gives 16 + 4 + 1 = 21 => y = 1; other small |x| yield values not powers of 21. Negative y gives non-integer RHS, impossible. Thus only integer solutions are (-2, 1), (0, 0), (2, 1).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"{(-2, 1), (0, 0), (2, 1)}\"\n}",
