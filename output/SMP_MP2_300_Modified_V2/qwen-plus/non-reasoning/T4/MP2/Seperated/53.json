  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\nWe are told:\n\n- $ P(x) $ is a polynomial of degree $ n $,\n- $ P(k) = \\frac{k}{k+1} $ for $ k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n $,\n- Define an auxiliary polynomial $ Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x $,\n- $ Q(x) $ has degree $ n+1 $ (since $ (x+1)P(x) $ is degree $ n+1 $, and subtracting $ x $ doesn’t reduce degree unless leading coefficients cancel — but we’ll see),\n- We are to compute $ q = Q(-1) $.\n\nLet’s analyze $ Q(x) $.\n\nGiven:\n$$\nQ(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x\n$$\n\nThen:\n$$\nQ(-1) = (-1 + 1)P(-1) - (-1) = 0 \\cdot P(-1) + 1 = 1\n$$\n\nWait — that seems too easy! But hold on: Is this valid? Yes, algebraically, plugging $ x = -1 $ gives:\n\n$$\nQ(-1) = ( -1 + 1 ) P(-1) - (-1) = 0 \\cdot P(-1) + 1 = 1\n$$\n\nSo regardless of what $ P $ is, as long as it's defined at $ -1 $ (which it is, since it's a polynomial), $ Q(-1) = 1 $. So answer is 1?\n\nBut wait — the problem says “Instead of determining the polynomial's value at the point immediately following the last given evaluation point, simply find $ q = Q(-1) $, where $ Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x $.” So maybe they want us to verify consistency or use the given data to confirm that $ Q(x) $ has certain roots, and then deduce $ Q(-1) $ via interpolation or factorization.\n\nLet’s double-check.\n\nWe know $ P(k) = \\frac{k}{k+1} $ for $ k = 0, 1, ..., n $. Then:\n\n$$\nQ(k) = (k+1)P(k) - k = (k+1)\\cdot \\frac{k}{k+1} - k = k - k = 0\n$$\n\nSo $ Q(k) = 0 $ for $ k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n $. That’s $ n+1 $ distinct roots.\n\nSince $ Q(x) $ is degree $ n+1 $, and has $ n+1 $ roots at $ x = 0, 1, ..., n $, it must be of the form:\n\n$$\nQ(x) = c \\cdot x(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-n)\n$$\n\nfor some constant $ c $.\n\nSo:\n$$\nQ(x) = c \\cdot \\prod_{j=0}^{n} (x - j)\n$$\n\nNow evaluate $ Q(-1) $:\n\n$$\nQ(-1) = c \\cdot \\prod_{j=0}^{n} (-1 - j) = c \\cdot \\prod_{j=0}^{n} (-(j+1)) = c \\cdot (-1)^{n+1} \\cdot \\prod_{j=0}^{n} (j+1) = c \\cdot (-1)^{n+1} \\cdot (n+1)!\n$$\n\nSo if we can find $ c $, we can compute $ Q(-1) $.\n\nHow to find $ c $? Use another known value of $ Q(x) $. For example, consider behavior as $ x \\to \\infty $, or plug in a convenient $ x $ not among $ 0,\\dots,n $. But we only know $ Q(k)=0 $ for those $ k $. However, recall definition:\n\n$$\nQ(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x\n$$\n\nSo for large $ x $, $ P(x) $ is degree $ n $, say leading term $ a x^n $. Then $ (x+1)P(x) $ has leading term $ a x^{n+1} $, and subtracting $ x $ doesn’t affect leading term. So $ Q(x) $ has leading coefficient $ a $.\n\nOn the other hand, $ Q(x) = c \\cdot x(x-1)\\cdots(x-n) $, whose leading term is $ c x^{n+1} $. So $ c = a $, the leading coefficient of $ P $.\n\nBut we don’t know $ a $. So perhaps better to evaluate $ Q(x) $ at another point where we can compute both sides — like $ x = -1 $, but that’s what we want.\n\nWait — earlier we computed directly $ Q(-1) = 1 $, using definition. Is that correct?\n\nYes:\n\n$$\nQ(-1) = ((-1)+1) P(-1) - (-1) = 0 \\cdot P(-1) + 1 = 1\n$$\n\nThat’s algebraically exact, no assumptions needed. Since $ P $ is a polynomial, it's defined everywhere, including at $ -1 $, so this holds.\n\nSo why go through the root argument? Because maybe the problem expects us to realize that $ Q(x) = c \\cdot \\prod_{j=0}^n (x-j) $, and then compute $ c $ by evaluating at another point — say $ x = -1 $ — but that’s circular.\n\nAlternatively, evaluate $ Q(x) $ at $ x = -1 $ using both expressions:\n\nFrom definition: $ Q(-1) = 1 $\n\nFrom factored form: $ Q(-1) = c \\cdot (-1)(-2)\\cdots(-(n+1)) = c \\cdot (-1)^{n+1} (n+1)! $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nc = \\frac{1}{(-1)^{n+1} (n+1)!} = \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\n$$\n\nBut again, not needed — the question only asks for $ Q(-1) $, which is unambiguously 1.\n\nThus, answer to Problem 1 is **1**.\n\n✅ Confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\nLet $ z $ be a complex number such that:\n\n- $ |z - 1| = 2 $\n- $ |z^2 - 1| = 6 $\n\nFind $ \\operatorname{Re}(z) $.\n\nLet $ z = x + iy $, with $ x, y \\in \\mathbb{R} $. Then:\n\n1. $ |z - 1| = |(x - 1) + iy| = \\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + y^2} = 2 $  \n   ⇒ $ (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 4 $  … (Eq. 1)\n\n2. $ z^2 = (x + iy)^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy $, so  \n   $ z^2 - 1 = (x^2 - y^2 - 1) + i(2xy) $,  \n   so  \n   $ |z^2 - 1|^2 = (x^2 - y^2 - 1)^2 + (2xy)^2 = 36 $  … (Eq. 2)\n\nWe need to find $ x = \\operatorname{Re}(z) $.\n\nLet’s simplify Eq. 2.\n\nCompute:\n\n$$\n(x^2 - y^2 - 1)^2 + 4x^2 y^2\n$$\n\nExpand first term:\n\n$ (x^2 - y^2 - 1)^2 = (x^2 - y^2)^2 - 2(x^2 - y^2) + 1 = x^4 - 2x^2 y^2 + y^4 - 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 1 $\n\nThen add $ 4x^2 y^2 $:\n\nTotal = $ x^4 - 2x^2 y^2 + y^4 - 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 1 + 4x^2 y^2 = x^4 + 2x^2 y^2 + y^4 - 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 1 $\n\nNote $ x^4 + 2x^2 y^2 + y^4 = (x^2 + y^2)^2 $, so:\n\n$$\n|z^2 - 1|^2 = (x^2 + y^2)^2 - 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 1 = 36 \\quad \\text{(Eq. 2')}\n$$\n\nFrom Eq. 1: $ (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 4 \\Rightarrow x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 = 4 \\Rightarrow x^2 + y^2 = 2x + 3 $\n\nLet $ r^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 2x + 3 $. So $ r^2 = 2x + 3 $. Good.\n\nThen $ (x^2 + y^2)^2 = (2x + 3)^2 = 4x^2 + 12x + 9 $\n\nAlso, from $ x^2 + y^2 = 2x + 3 $, solve for $ y^2 = 2x + 3 - x^2 $\n\nThen $ 2y^2 = 4x + 6 - 2x^2 $\n\nNow plug into Eq. 2':\n\n$$\n(x^2 + y^2)^2 - 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 1 = 36\n$$\n\nSubstitute:\n\n- $ (x^2 + y^2)^2 = (2x + 3)^2 = 4x^2 + 12x + 9 $\n- $ -2x^2 $\n- $ +2y^2 = 4x + 6 - 2x^2 $\n- $ +1 $\n\nSum all:\n\n$$\n[4x^2 + 12x + 9] + [-2x^2] + [4x + 6 - 2x^2] + 1\n$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- $ 4x^2 - 2x^2 - 2x^2 = 0 $\n- $ 12x + 4x = 16x $\n- Constants: $ 9 + 6 + 1 = 16 $\n\nSo total = $ 16x + 16 = 36 $\n\nThus:\n\n$$\n16x = 20 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{20}{16} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25\n$$\n\nSo real part of $ z $ is $ \\frac{5}{4} $.\n\n✅ Check consistency:\n\nIf $ x = \\frac{5}{4} $, then from Eq. 1:\n\n$ (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 4 \\Rightarrow (\\frac{1}{4})^2 + y^2 = 4 \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{16} + y^2 = 4 \\Rightarrow y^2 = \\frac{64 - 1}{16} = \\frac{63}{16} $\n\nSo $ y = \\pm \\sqrt{63}/4 $, fine.\n\nThen $ z^2 - 1 $ magnitude squared:\n\nWe already derived it reduces correctly, and our algebra led to identity, so it's consistent.\n\nThus answer is $ \\frac{5}{4} $.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n- Problem 1: $ Q(-1) = 1 $\n- Problem 2: $ \\operatorname{Re}(z) = \\frac{5}{4} $\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Define Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x. Direct substitution x = -1 yields Q(-1) = 0*P(-1) + 1 = 1. This is exact and independent of P's form. Problem 2: Let z = x + iy. From |z - 1| = 2, we get (x-1)^2 + y^2 = 4. From |z^2 - 1| = 6, square both sides and simplify using x^2 + y^2 = 2x + 3 (derived from first equation), leading to 16x + 16 = 36, so x = 5/4.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"5/4\"\n}",
