      "A3384": "One day, there is a Street Art Show at somewhere, and there are some spectators around. We consider this place as an Euclidean plane. Let $K$ be the center of the show. And name the spectators by $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}, \\ldots$ They pick their positions $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}, \\ldots$ one by one. The positions need to satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously. (i) The distance between $K$ and $A_{n}$ is no less than 10 meters, that is, $K P_{n} \\geq 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any positive integer $n$. (ii) The distance between $A_{n}$ and any previous spectator is no less than 1 meter, that is, $P_{m} P_{n} \\geq 1 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any $n \\geq 2$ and any $1 \\leq m \\leq n-1$. (iii) $A_{n}$ always choose the position closest to $K$ that satisfies (i) and (ii), that is, $K P_{n}$ reaches its minimum possible value. If there are more than one point that satisfy (i) and (ii) and have the minimum distance to $K, A_{n}$ may choose any one of them. For example, $A_{1}$ is not restricted by (ii), so he may choose any point on the circle $C$ which is centered at $K$ with radius 10 meters. For $A_{2}$, since there are lots of points on $C$ which are at least 1 meter apart from $P_{1}$, he may choose anyone of them. (1) Which of the following statement is true? (A) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2}$ always hold (unit: meter); (B) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\sqrt{n} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} \\sqrt{n}$ always hold (unit: meter); (C) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n$ always hold (unit: meter); (D) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n^{2} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n^{2}$ always hold (unit: meter)."

  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve each step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\nWe are told:\n\n- $ f_1(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 48} $\n- $ f_{n+1}(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 6 f_n(x)} $\n\nThen it says:\n\n> Instead of finding all real solutions of the equation $ f_n(x) = 2x $ for each positive integer $ n $, simply find $ e = k - 8 $, where $ k $ is the constant satisfying $ f_1(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 6k} $ derived from the given definition.\n\nSo we need to match the given expression for $ f_1(x) $ with the form $ \\sqrt{x^2 + 6k} $, and solve for $ k $, then compute $ e = k - 8 $.\n\nGiven:\n$$\nf_1(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 48}\n$$\n\nBut also, per the pattern used in the recurrence (i.e., $ f_{n+1}(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 6 f_n(x)} $), the *first* function is defined separately, but the problem says: “find $ k $ such that $ f_1(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 6k} $”.\n\nSo set:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{x^2 + 48} = \\sqrt{x^2 + 6k}\n$$\n\nSince square roots are equal and nonnegative, their radicands must be equal:\n\n$$\nx^2 + 48 = x^2 + 6k \\Rightarrow 48 = 6k \\Rightarrow k = 8\n$$\n\nThen $ e = k - 8 = 8 - 8 = 0 $\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\nWe have spectators $ A_1, A_2, \\dots $ placing themselves on the Euclidean plane around center $ K $, obeying:\n\n- (i) $ KP_n \\geq 10 $ — all points lie on or outside circle radius 10.\n- (ii) $ P_m P_n \\geq 1 $ for all $ m < n $ — minimum pairwise distance is 1 meter.\n- (iii) $ A_n $ chooses the point **closest to $ K $** satisfying (i) and (ii). That is, minimize $ KP_n $ subject to being at least 10 away from $ K $, and at least 1 away from all previous $ P_1, ..., P_{n-1} $.\n\nWe are to determine asymptotic growth rate of $ KP_n $ as $ n \\to \\infty $, i.e., how far from center the $ n $-th spectator must stand, *in the worst-case or guaranteed* scenario.\n\nNote: The problem says “no matter how $ A_1, ..., A_n $ choose their positions”, meaning we consider the *worst-case* placement consistent with the rules — but actually, rule (iii) says they *always choose the position closest to $ K $* satisfying constraints. So it's a *deterministic greedy process*, but with some ambiguity when multiple points achieve minimal distance — they may choose any.\n\nSo the process is essentially: pack points in the plane, starting from radius 10 outward, such that each new point is as close to center as possible while staying ≥10 from center and ≥1 from all earlier points.\n\nThis is analogous to packing non-overlapping unit disks (radius 0.5) whose centers are at least distance 1 apart, and all centers lie in annulus $ r \\geq 10 $. Since each point requires a disk of radius 0.5 around it that doesn’t overlap with others, the area required for $ n $ points is at least $ n \\cdot \\pi (0.5)^2 = n \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4} $.\n\nAll points lie in the disk of radius $ R_n = KP_n $, but only the part with radius ≥10. So the available region for placing $ n $ points is the annulus $ 10 \\leq r \\leq R_n $, whose area is $ \\pi(R_n^2 - 10^2) $.\n\nTo fit $ n $ disjoint unit-distance-separated points (i.e., centers of disjoint radius-0.5 disks), we need:\n\n$$\n\\pi(R_n^2 - 100) \\geq n \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad R_n^2 - 100 \\geq \\frac{n}{4} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad R_n^2 \\geq \\frac{n}{4} + 100\n$$\n\nSo asymptotically, $ R_n \\gtrsim \\sqrt{n/4} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{n} $. So $ R_n $ grows like $ \\Theta(\\sqrt{n}) $.\n\nAlso, can we achieve $ R_n = O(\\sqrt{n}) $? Yes — by arranging points in concentric circles (like hexagonal packing), you can place ~$ c R $ points on circle radius $ R $, and total number up to radius $ R $ is ~$ c' R^2 $. So to get $ n $ points, need $ R \\sim \\sqrt{n} $.\n\nThus, there exist constants $ c_1, c_2 > 0 $ such that for all $ n $,\n$$\nc_1 \\sqrt{n} \\leq KP_n \\leq c_2 \\sqrt{n}\n$$\n\nHence option **(B)** is correct.\n\nLet’s double-check other options:\n\n- (A): bounded? No — as $ n $ increases, you eventually run out of space near radius 10; you must go farther out → unbounded.\n- (C): linear? That would mean area grows like $ n^2 $, but area only grows like $ R^2 $, so $ R \\sim \\sqrt{n} $, not $ n $.\n- (D): quadratic? Even worse.\n\nSo (B) is correct.\n\n✅ Answer to Problem 2 is **\"B\"**\n\n---\n\n### Final JSON:\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Given f_1(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 48), and we need k such that f_1(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 6k). Equating radicands gives 48 = 6k => k = 8, so e = k - 8 = 0. Problem 2: Spectators are placed greedily at minimal distance from K while maintaining min distance 1 from each other and min distance 10 from K. This is equivalent to packing n non-overlapping disks of radius 0.5 in the region r >= 10. The area required grows linearly with n, while area available up to radius R is pi(R^2 - 100), leading to R ~ sqrt(n). Thus KP_n is Theta(sqrt(n)), so option (B) is correct.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"B\"\n}",
