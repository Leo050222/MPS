  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\nWe are to find $ m = |A \\cap B \\cap C| $, where $ A, B, C \\subseteq \\{1,2,\\dots,8\\} $, each of size 4, and pairwise intersections all have size 2:\n\n- $ |A| = |B| = |C| = 4 $\n- $ |A \\cap B| = |B \\cap C| = |C \\cap A| = 2 $\n\nWe are told: *“where $ |A \\cap B \\cap C| $ is the size of the triple intersection derived from the structural consideration of configurations with no elements belonging to exactly two of the sets.”*\n\nThat phrase is unusual — let’s parse it carefully.\n\nIt says: “derived from the structural consideration of configurations with **no elements belonging to exactly two** of the sets.”\n\nSo consider the Venn diagram of three sets $ A, B, C $. Each element in the universe $ \\{1,\\dots,8\\} $ can belong to:\n\n- None of the sets\n- Exactly one: only $ A $, only $ B $, only $ C $\n- Exactly two: $ A \\cap B \\setminus C $, $ B \\cap C \\setminus A $, $ C \\cap A \\setminus B $\n- All three: $ A \\cap B \\cap C $\n\nThe phrase says: “configurations with **no elements belonging to exactly two** of the sets”. So the regions $ A \\cap B \\setminus C $, $ B \\cap C \\setminus A $, $ C \\cap A \\setminus B $ are all empty.\n\nThat means:\n- $ A \\cap B \\subseteq C $, so $ A \\cap B = A \\cap B \\cap C $\n- Similarly, $ B \\cap C = A \\cap B \\cap C $, and $ C \\cap A = A \\cap B \\cap C $\n\nTherefore, all three pairwise intersections equal the triple intersection.\n\nBut we’re told $ |A \\cap B| = |B \\cap C| = |C \\cap A| = 2 $, so then:\n\n$$\n|A \\cap B \\cap C| = 2\n$$\n\nWait — but is that possible? Let's verify consistency with sizes.\n\nAssume $ A \\cap B \\cap C = X $, with $ |X| = x $. Since there are no elements in exactly two sets, then:\n\n- Elements in $ A $ only: $ a $\n- Elements in $ B $ only: $ b $\n- Elements in $ C $ only: $ c $\n- Elements in all three: $ x $\n- No elements in exactly two.\n\nThen:\n\n- $ |A| = a + x = 4 $ → $ a = 4 - x $\n- $ |B| = b + x = 4 $ → $ b = 4 - x $\n- $ |C| = c + x = 4 $ → $ c = 4 - x $\n\nAlso, pairwise intersections:\n\n- $ A \\cap B = X $, since no elements in exactly two → $ |A \\cap B| = x $, but given $ |A \\cap B| = 2 $, so $ x = 2 $\n\nThus $ m = 2 $\n\nCheck total number of distinct elements used:\n\nTotal elements in $ A \\cup B \\cup C = a + b + c + x = 3(4 - x) + x = 12 - 3x + x = 12 - 2x $\n\nIf $ x = 2 $, then union size = $ 12 - 4 = 8 $. That fits perfectly since the ground set has size 8, and all elements must lie in $ A \\cup B \\cup C $ (since if any element is in none, union size < 8, but not forbidden — wait, is it required that all 8 elements are used? No — condition only says subsets of {1,…,8}, no requirement to cover all.\n\nBut here, union size = 8 when $ x = 2 $, meaning all 8 elements are used — one possibility. But could there be unused elements? Let's see.\n\nSuppose $ x = 2 $, then $ a = b = c = 2 $, so total elements in union = $ a + b + c + x = 2+2+2+2 = 8 $. So indeed, all 8 elements are used, each in exactly one of the “only A”, “only B”, “only C”, or “all three” regions.\n\nThat matches the universe size. So this configuration is tight and feasible.\n\nCould $ x $ be other values? Suppose $ x = 1 $: then $ a = b = c = 3 $, union size = $ 3+3+3+1 = 10 > 8 $, impossible.\n\nIf $ x = 3 $: then $ a = b = c = 1 $, union = $ 1+1+1+3 = 6 \\le 8 $, okay — but then $ |A \\cap B| = x = 3 $, contradicting given $ |A \\cap B| = 2 $. So only possible $ x = 2 $.\n\nHence $ m = 2 $\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **2**\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\nWe need to count the number of ways to assemble a $ 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 $ cube using:\n\n- 2 red unit cubes\n- 25 white unit cubes  \n(so total $ 2 + 25 = 27 = 3^3 $, perfect)\n\nConstraint: **red is visible on exactly 4 faces of the larger cube**.\n\nInterpretation: The large cube has 6 faces. Each face is a $ 3 \\times 3 = 9 $ grid of unit-square faces. A red unit cube contributes its face(s) to the exterior if it lies on the surface.\n\nA unit cube in a $ 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 $ cube can be:\n\n- **Corner**: 3 faces exposed → contributes to 3 outer faces\n- **Edge (not corner)**: on an edge but not corner → in $ 3\\times3\\times3 $, edges have length 3 → each edge has 3 cubes: 2 corners + 1 middle. So edge-middle cubes have **2 faces exposed**\n- **Face-center (center of a face, not on edge)**: each face has 9 positions; center is position (2,2) on that face → such a cube has **1 face exposed**\n- **Interior**: the very center cube (position (2,2,2)) → **0 faces exposed**\n\nLet’s classify all 27 positions by number of exposed faces:\n\n- **Corners**: 8 corners → each has 3 faces exposed  \n- **Edges (non-corner)**: A cube has 12 edges. Each edge has 1 non-corner cube (since length 3 → positions 1,2,3 → 1 and 3 are corners, 2 is middle). So 12 edge-centers → each has 2 faces exposed  \n- **Face-centers (center of each face, not on edge)**: 6 faces, each has 1 center cube → 6 cubes, each with 1 face exposed  \n- **Interior**: 1 cube at very center → 0 faces exposed  \n\nCheck count: $ 8 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 27 $ ✅\n\nSo exposure counts:\n\n| Type             | Count | Exposed faces per cube |\n|------------------|-------|------------------------|\n| Corner           | 8     | 3                      |\n| Edge-middle      | 12    | 2                      |\n| Face-center      | 6     | 1                      |\n| Interior         | 1     | 0                      |\n\nWe place **2 red cubes**, and want total number of **red-colored unit-square faces visible on the exterior** to be exactly **4**.\n\nEach red cube contributes some number of visible faces (depending on its position), and total visible red faces = sum over the two red cubes of their exposed faces.\n\nSo we need to choose two positions (distinct) from the 27, such that the sum of their exposures = 4.\n\nLet’s list all unordered pairs (i,j) of position types (with multiplicities) such that exp(i) + exp(j) = 4.\n\nPossible exposure values: 0,1,2,3.\n\nSo pairs (a,b) with a ≤ b, a + b = 4:\n\n- (0,4): no cube has 4 exposed faces → invalid  \n- (1,3): yes → face-center (1) + corner (3) → sum = 4  \n- (2,2): edge-middle + edge-middle → 2+2 = 4  \n- (0,4), (4,0): invalid  \n- (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) — but unordered, so two cases: (1,3) and (2,2)\n\nAlso (4,0) invalid. What about (0,4)? No. (1,3), (2,2), and (4,0) only options for sum 4.\n\nIs (0,4) possible? No cube has 4 faces exposed in 3×3×3 — max is 3.\n\nSo only two cases:\n\n**Case 1**: One red cube at a face-center (exposure 1), one at a corner (exposure 3) → total = 4  \n**Case 2**: Both red cubes at edge-middle positions (each exposure 2) → total = 4  \n\nAre there others? (4,0) no. (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) same as above. So only these.\n\nNow compute number of ways for each case.\n\nBut careful: the problem says “red is visible on exactly 4 faces of the larger cube”.\n\nImportant: Could a single red cube lie on multiple faces, but those faces are *different* faces of the big cube — yes, e.g., corner lies on 3 faces. So “visible on exactly 4 faces” means: among the 6 outer faces of the big cube, exactly 4 of them contain at least one red square.\n\nWait! Reread problem:\n\n> “red is visible on exactly 4 faces of the larger cube”\n\nThis is ambiguous: does it mean:\n\n- (A) Total number of unit-square red faces visible = 4?  \n- (B) Number of big cube faces (out of 6) that show at least one red square = 4?\n\nIn combinatorics problems like this, especially with coloring cubes and visibility, “red is visible on exactly k faces” usually means **exactly k of the 6 outer faces of the large cube contain at least one red unit-square** — i.e., the projection onto those faces shows red.\n\nFor example, if both red cubes are on the same face, say both on front face, then only 1 face shows red.\n\nIf one is on front (face-center), one on top (face-center), then 2 faces show red.\n\nBut if one is on a corner, it belongs to 3 faces — so it makes 3 faces show red.\n\nSo “red is visible on exactly 4 faces” means: the set of large cube faces that contain ≥1 red unit-square has cardinality 4.\n\nThat interpretation matches standard phrasing (e.g., “a color appears on exactly k faces” means k faces exhibit that color).\n\nSo we need: the union of the sets of large-faces covered by the two red cubes has size exactly 4.\n\nEach red cube occupies some subset of the 6 faces:\n\n- Corner cube: belongs to 3 faces (e.g., (1,1,1) → x=1,y=1,z=1 → faces: x=1, y=1, z=1)\n- Edge-middle (non-corner): belongs to 2 faces (e.g., along edge where x=1,y=1, z=2 → faces x=1 and y=1)\n- Face-center: belongs to 1 face (e.g., center of front face z=1 → only z=1)\n- Interior: belongs to 0 faces\n\nSo define for each position, its face-set $ F(p) \\subseteq \\{F_x^-, F_x^+, F_y^-, F_y^+, F_z^-, F_z^+\\} $, size = exposure count.\n\nWe need $ |F(p_1) \\cup F(p_2)| = 4 $\n\nSo now we must count number of unordered pairs of distinct positions $ (p_1, p_2) $ such that the union of their face-sets has size 4.\n\nSince rotations/reflections are considered distinct, we don’t identify symmetric positions — all positions are labeled by coordinates; each of the 27 cells is unique.\n\nSo we can enumerate by type and compute.\n\nFirst, label the 6 faces:\n\n- $ X^- $: face with x = 1  \n- $ X^+ $: face with x = 3  \n- $ Y^- $: y = 1  \n- $ Y^+ $: y = 3  \n- $ Z^- $: z = 1  \n- $ Z^+ $: z = 3  \n\nCorners: all combinations of coordinates in {1,3} × {1,3} × {1,3} → 8 corners. Each corner lies on three faces, one from each pair: e.g., (1,1,1) → $ X^-, Y^-, Z^- $; (1,1,3) → $ X^-, Y^-, Z^+ $, etc.\n\nEdge-middle positions: on edges — an edge is intersection of two face-planes. For example, edge where x=1 and y=1 → z varies: positions (1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,1,3); middle is (1,1,2) → belongs to $ X^- $ and $ Y^- $. So each edge-middle belongs to exactly two faces — specifically, one from each of two coordinate directions, fixed to min or max.\n\nThere are 12 edges:\n\n- Edges parallel to x-axis: fix y and z ∈ {1,3} → 2×2 = 4 edges → each has middle at y,z fixed, x=2 → e.g., (2,1,1) → faces $ Y^- $, $ Z^- $  \n- Parallel to y-axis: fix x,z ∈ {1,3} → 4 edges → middle at x,z fixed, y=2  \n- Parallel to z-axis: fix x,y ∈ {1,3} → 4 edges → middle at x,y fixed, z=2  \n\nSo all edge-middles belong to two faces, and the two faces are from different axes (never both X^− and X^+, obviously).\n\nFace-centers: centers of each face:\n\n- $ X^- $ face-center: (1,2,2) → only $ X^- $  \n- $ X^+ $: (3,2,2)  \n- $ Y^- $: (2,1,2)  \n- $ Y^+ $: (2,3,2)  \n- $ Z^- $: (2,2,1)  \n- $ Z^+ $: (2,2,3)  \n\nSo 6 positions, each associated with exactly one face.\n\nInterior: (2,2,2) → no face.\n\nNow, to compute number of unordered pairs $ \\{p_1,p_2\\} $ such that $ |F(p_1) \\cup F(p_2)| = 4 $\n\nWe’ll go case by case based on types of $ p_1, p_2 $. Let’s denote types:\n\n- C: corner, |F| = 3  \n- E: edge-middle, |F| = 2  \n- F: face-center, |F| = 1  \n- I: interior, |F| = 0  \n\nWe need $ |F_1 \\cup F_2| = 4 $. Since max |F| = 3, possible combos:\n\n- C + C: |F1| = |F2| = 3 → |union| can be 3,4,5,6 depending on overlap  \n- C + E: 3+2 → union size between max(3,2)=3 and min(6,5)=5  \n- C + F: 3+1 → union size 3 or 4 (if F-face not in C’s 3, then 4; if it is, then 3)  \n- C + I: 3+0 = 3 → too small  \n- E + E: 2+2 → union size 2,3, or 4  \n- E + F: 2+1 → union size 2 or 3 (if F-face not in E’s two, then 3; if it is, then 2)  \n- E + I: 2+0 = 2  \n- F + F: 1+1 → union size 1 or 2  \n- F + I: 1  \n- I + I: 0  \n\nSo only possible combos yielding union size 4 are:\n\n- C + C  \n- C + E  \n- C + F  \n- E + E  \n\nLet’s analyze each.\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 1: C + C (two corners)**\n\nEach corner has 3 faces. Union size = 4 means they share exactly 2 faces? Let's compute:\n\n$ |F1 \\cup F2| = |F1| + |F2| - |F1 \\cap F2| = 3 + 3 - |int| = 6 - |int| $\n\nSet = 4 ⇒ $ 6 - |int| = 4 $ ⇒ $ |F1 \\cap F2| = 2 $\n\nSo two corners must share exactly 2 faces → meaning they agree in two coordinates (since each face corresponds to fixing a coordinate to 1 or 3). A corner is a point in {1,3}^3.\n\nTwo corners share a face if they agree in the coordinate corresponding to that face’s direction.\n\nE.g., corners (1,1,1) and (1,1,3) both have x=1 and y=1 → so they share faces $ X^- $ and $ Y^- $ → intersection size 2 → union size 4. Indeed: F1 = {X^-,Y^-,Z^-}, F2 = {X^-,Y^-,Z^+}, intersection = {X^-,Y^-}, size 2.\n\nWhen do two corners share exactly 2 faces? They must agree in exactly two coordinates (since each coordinate fixed to 1 or 3 defines a face). In {1,3}^3, two points agree in k coordinates ⇒ Hamming distance = 3−k.\n\nAgree in 2 coords ⇒ differ in 1 coord ⇒ e.g., (1,1,1) and (1,1,3): same x,y, different z.\n\nNumber of such ordered pairs: choose which coordinate differs: 3 choices. For that coordinate, if first is 1, second must be 3, or vice versa — but since values are only 1 or 3, for a fixed coordinate, there are 2 possibilities: (1,3) or (3,1). But since corners are all combinations, for each choice of differing coordinate, number of unordered pairs that differ only there:\n\n- Fix coordinate to vary: say z. Then x and y must match. x ∈ {1,3}, y ∈ {1,3} → 4 choices for (x,y). For each, corners are (x,y,1) and (x,y,3) → one unordered pair per (x,y). So 4 pairs per axis.\n\n3 axes → 3 × 4 = 12 unordered pairs of corners that differ in exactly one coordinate → intersection size 2 → union size 4.\n\nTotal corner pairs: $ \\binom{8}{2} = 28 $. Let's verify: pairs differing in 1 coord: 12; in 2 coords: e.g., (1,1,1) & (1,3,3): agree only in x → intersection size 1 → union size 5; differ in 3 coords: (1,1,1) & (3,3,3): agree in 0 → intersection 0 → union 6.\n\nSo only the 12 pairs with Hamming distance 1 give union size 4.\n\nSo Case 1 contributes **12** placements.\n\nBut wait — are the red cubes distinguishable? No, they are identical red cubes. So unordered pairs are correct.\n\nSo 12 ways for two corners.\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 2: C + E (corner + edge-middle)**\n\nCorner has 3 faces, edge-middle has 2 faces. Want $ |F_C \\cup F_E| = 4 $\n\nSo $ |F_C| + |F_E| - |F_C \\cap F_E| = 3 + 2 - |int| = 5 - |int| = 4 $ ⇒ $ |F_C \\cap F_E| = 1 $\n\nSo they share exactly one face.\n\nWe need to count number of (corner, edge-middle) pairs such that their face-sets intersect in exactly one face.\n\nFirst, total corners: 8  \nTotal edge-middles: 12  \n\nBut need to count how many E's intersect a given C in exactly one face.\n\nFix a corner, say (1,1,1) → faces $ X^-, Y^-, Z^- $\n\nWhich edge-middles have face-set intersecting this in size 1?\n\nEdge-middles are on edges — each edge is intersection of two face-planes.\n\nList all 12 edges and their face-sets:\n\nEdges parallel to x-axis (vary x, y,z fixed ∈ {1,3}):\n\n- y=1,z=1 → edge: (1,1,1)-(3,1,1), middle (2,1,1) → faces $ Y^-, Z^- $  \n- y=1,z=3 → (2,1,3) → $ Y^-, Z^+ $  \n- y=3,z=1 → (2,3,1) → $ Y^+, Z^- $  \n- y=3,z=3 → (2,3,3) → $ Y^+, Z^+ $  \n\nParallel to y-axis (x,z fixed):\n\n- x=1,z=1 → (1,2,1) → $ X^-, Z^- $  \n- x=1,z=3 → (1,2,3) → $ X^-, Z^+ $  \n- x=3,z=1 → (3,2,1) → $ X^+, Z^- $  \n- x=3,z=3 → (3,2,3) → $ X^+, Z^+ $  \n\nParallel to z-axis (x,y fixed):\n\n- x=1,y=1 → (1,1,2) → $ X^-, Y^- $  \n- x=1,y=3 → (1,3,2) → $ X^-, Y^+ $  \n- x=3,y=1 → (3,1,2) → $ X^+, Y^- $  \n- x=3,y=3 → (3,3,2) → $ X^+, Y^+ $  \n\nSo all 12 edge-middles, each with two faces.\n\nNow corner (1,1,1): faces $ X^-, Y^-, Z^- $\n\nCompute intersection with each E:\n\n- (2,1,1): $ Y^-, Z^- $ → int = {Y^-, Z^-} → size 2  \n- (2,1,3): $ Y^-, Z^+ $ → int = {Y^-} → size 1 ✅  \n- (2,3,1): $ Y^+, Z^- $ → int = {Z^-} → size 1 ✅  \n- (2,3,3): $ Y^+, Z^+ $ → int = ∅ → size 0  \n- (1,2,1): $ X^-, Z^- $ → int = {X^-, Z^-} → size 2  \n- (1,2,3): $ X^-, Z^+ $ → int = {X^-} → size 1 ✅  \n- (3,2,1): $ X^+, Z^- $ → int = {Z^-} → size 1 ✅  \n- (3,2,3): $ X^+, Z^+ $ → int = ∅  \n- (1,1,2): $ X^-, Y^- $ → int = {X^-, Y^-} → size 2  \n- (1,3,2): $ X^-, Y^+ $ → int = {X^-} → size 1 ✅  \n- (3,1,2): $ X^+, Y^- $ → int = {Y^-} → size 1 ✅  \n- (3,3,2): $ X^+, Y^+ $ → int = ∅  \n\nSo for corner (1,1,1), which E's give intersection size 1? Let's list:\n\n- (2,1,3): Y^-,Z^+ → int {Y^-}  \n- (2,3,1): Y^+,Z^- → int {Z^-}  \n- (1,2,3): X^-,Z^+ → int {X^-}  \n- (3,2,1): X^+,Z^- → int {Z^-}  \n- (1,3,2): X^-,Y^+ → int {X^-}  \n- (3,1,2): X^+,Y^- → int {Y^-}  \n\nThat's 6 edge-middles.\n\nSimilarly, by symmetry, each corner will have exactly 6 edge-middles with intersection size 1.\n\nBecause for a corner, its 3 faces are, say, A,B,C. An edge-middle has two faces. To intersect in exactly one, its two-face set must contain exactly one of A,B,C. Number of 2-element subsets of {A,B,C,D,E,F} that contain exactly one of A,B,C — but edge-middles’ face-sets are always two faces from different axes, so cannot be, say, X^- and X^+. So for corner with faces X^-,Y^-,Z^-, the edge-middles with exactly one of these are those whose two faces include one from {X^-,Y^-,Z^-} and one from the complementary set {X^+,Y^+,Z^+}. How many such edge-middles?\n\nAn edge-middle is defined by fixing two coordinates to 1 or 3, and varying the third. Its faces correspond to the two fixed coordinates.\n\nSo for corner (1,1,1), fixed coords are all 1. To share exactly one face, the edge-middle must fix exactly one coordinate to 1 (matching), and the other fixed coordinate to 3 (not matching). Because if both fixed to 1, then both faces match → intersection size 2. If one fixed to 1, one to 3 → intersection size 1. If both to 3 → intersection 0.\n\nSo for corner (1,1,1), edge-middles where exactly one of their two fixed coordinates is 1.\n\nNumber of edge-middles: each is determined by choosing which axis is varying (3 choices), and values of the other two coordinates (each ∈ {1,3} → 4 combos). So 3 × 4 = 12.\n\nFor a given corner, say all coords 1, number of edge-middles with exactly one coordinate fixed to 1: choose which of the two fixed coordinates is 1: 2 choices; set that to 1, the other to 3; and choose axis varying: but wait, better: for each edge type:\n\n- Parallel to x: y,z fixed. To have exactly one of y,z = 1: (y,z) ∈ {(1,3),(3,1)} → 2 options  \n- Parallel to y: x,z fixed → (x,z) ∈ {(1,3),(3,1)} → 2  \n- Parallel to z: x,y fixed → (x,y) ∈ {(1,3),(3,1)} → 2  \n\nSo 2+2+2 = 6 per corner.\n\nYes, matches earlier count.\n\nSo each corner pairs with 6 edge-middles to give intersection size 1 → union size 4.\n\n8 corners × 6 = 48 ordered pairs (C,E). But since C and E are distinct types, and red cubes are identical, but positions are distinct, and we are choosing a set of two positions — one corner, one edge-middle — so unordered pair {c,e} is fine, and since c and e are different types, no double-counting. So 48 such pairs.\n\n✅ Case 2 contributes **48**\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 3: C + F (corner + face-center)**\n\nCorner has 3 faces, face-center has 1 face. Want $ |F_C \\cup F_F| = 4 $ ⇒ since |F_F| = 1, need that face not in F_C, i.e., $ F_F \\notin F_C $, so union size = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nSo face-center must be on a face *not incident to the corner*.\n\nCorner (1,1,1) is incident to faces X^-, Y^-, Z^-. So face-centers on X^+, Y^+, Z^+ are not incident → their faces are X^+, Y^+, Z^+, none in {X^-,Y^-,Z^-}, so union size = 4.\n\nHow many such face-centers? 3: X^+, Y^+, Z^+\n\nFace-centers total: 6. For a given corner, 3 are opposite (not sharing a face), 3 are adjacent (sharing a face: X^-, Y^-, Z^- themselves).\n\nSo per corner, 3 face-centers work.\n\n8 corners × 3 = 24\n\nAgain, unordered pairs of distinct types → 24 ways.\n\n✅ Case 3 contributes **24**\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 4: E + E (two edge-middles)**\n\nEach has 2 faces. Want $ |F_{E1} \\cup F_{E2}| = 4 $\n\nSo $ |F1| + |F2| - |F1 \\cap F2| = 2 + 2 - |int| = 4 - |int| = 4 $ ⇒ $ |int| = 0 $\n\nSo their face-sets must be disjoint.\n\nEach edge-middle has two faces, from two different axes.\n\nDisjoint means no common face → their two-face sets are completely disjoint.\n\nSince there are only 6 faces, and each E uses 2, disjoint means the four faces are all distinct.\n\nSo we need two edge-middles whose face-sets are disjoint.\n\nList all edge-middles with their face-sets:\n\nRecall:\n\n- Parallel to x: (2,y,z) with y,z ∈ {1,3} → faces Y^{y}, Z^{z}  \n  So:  \n  - (2,1,1): Y^-, Z^-  \n  - (2,1,3): Y^-, Z^+  \n  - (2,3,1): Y^+, Z^-  \n  - (2,3,3): Y^+, Z^+  \n\n- Parallel to y: (x,2,z), x,z ∈ {1,3} → faces X^{x}, Z^{z}  \n  - (1,2,1): X^-, Z^-  \n  - (1,2,3): X^-, Z^+  \n  - (3,2,1): X^+, Z^-  \n  - (3,2,3): X^+, Z^+  \n\n- Parallel to z: (x,y,2), x,y ∈ {1,3} → faces X^{x}, Y^{y}  \n  - (1,1,2): X^-, Y^-  \n  - (1,3,2): X^-, Y^+  \n  - (3,1,2): X^+, Y^-  \n  - (3,3,2): X^+, Y^+  \n\nSo all 12, each with two faces.\n\nWe need pairs of these with disjoint face-sets.\n\nLet’s find how many unordered pairs of edge-middles have disjoint face-sets.\n\nApproach: total E pairs = $ \\binom{12}{2} = 66 $. Subtract those with intersection size 1 or 2.\n\nBut maybe direct count is feasible.\n\nNote: Two edge-middles have disjoint faces iff their face-sets share no letter-direction or sign.\n\nSince each face is labeled by axis and sign, disjoint means:\n\n- No common axis? Not necessary — e.g., one has X^-, Y^-, another has X^+, Z^+ → they share axis X, but different signs, so faces are different → still disjoint. Disjoint means no common face, i.e., no identical label.\n\nSo (X^-,Y^-) and (X^+,Z^+) are disjoint.\n\nWhen do two edge-middles share a face? If they both have, say, X^-.\n\nSo to be disjoint, for each face in first, it's not in second.\n\nLet’s categorize edge-middles by their axis-pair:\n\n- Type YZ: 4 of them — faces involving Y and Z  \n- Type XZ: 4 — X and Z  \n- Type XY: 4 — X and Y  \n\nTwo edge-middles from same type: e.g., both YZ: (2,1,1): Y^-,Z^- and (2,1,3): Y^-,Z^+ → share Y^- → intersection size 1 → not disjoint.\n\nSimilarly, any two YZ-type share at least one axis, and likely a face.\n\nBut let's systematically count disjoint pairs.\n\nWe'll iterate over all 12, but smarter:\n\nFix an edge-middle, count how many others are disjoint from it.\n\nTake (2,1,1): faces Y^-, Z^-\n\nWhich other E's have neither Y^- nor Z^-?\n\nList all other 11:\n\nFrom YZ-type (parallel to x):  \n- (2,1,3): Y^-, Z^+ → has Y^- → not disjoint  \n- (2,3,1): Y^+, Z^- → has Z^- → not  \n- (2,3,3): Y^+, Z^+ → no Y^- or Z^- → disjoint ✅  \n\nFrom XZ-type (parallel to y):  \n- (1,2,1): X^-, Z^- → has Z^- → no  \n- (1,2,3): X^-, Z^+ → no Z^- or Y^- → disjoint ✅  \n- (3,2,1): X^+, Z^- → has Z^- → no  \n- (3,2,3): X^+, Z^+ → disjoint ✅  \n\nFrom XY-type (parallel to z):  \n- (1,1,2): X^-, Y^- → has Y^- → no  \n- (1,3,2): X^-, Y^+ → no Y^- or Z^- → disjoint ✅  \n- (3,1,2): X^+, Y^- → has Y^- → no  \n- (3,3,2): X^+, Y^+ → disjoint ✅  \n\nSo disjoint ones:  \n- (2,3,3)  \n- (1,2,3)  \n- (3,2,3)  \n- (1,3,2)  \n- (3,3,2)  \n\nThat's 5.\n\nList:  \n1. (2,3,3) — Y^+,Z^+  \n2. (1,2,3) — X^-,Z^+  \n3. (3,2,3) — X^+,Z^+  \n4. (1,3,2) — X^-,Y^+  \n5. (3,3,2) — X^+,Y^+  \n\nYes, 5.\n\nSo for (2,1,1), 5 disjoint partners.\n\nBy symmetry, each edge-middle has exactly 5 disjoint partners.\n\nBecause the structure is symmetric: each E has two faces; there are 6 faces; number of E's that avoid both specific faces.\n\nTotal E's: 12. Minus those that contain Y^- or Z^-.\n\nHow many E's contain Y^-? Those with Y^- in face-set:  \n- YZ-type with y=1: (2,1,1), (2,1,3) → 2  \n- XY-type with y=1: (1,1,2), (3,1,2) → 2  \nSo 4 contain Y^-  \n\nSimilarly, contain Z^-:  \n- YZ-type z=1: (2,1,1), (2,3,1) → 2  \n- XZ-type z=1: (1,2,1), (3,2,1) → 2  \nSo 4 contain Z^-  \n\nBut (2,1,1) contains both, so by inclusion-exclusion: |contain Y^- or Z^-| = 4 + 4 − 1 = 7 (since only (2,1,1) is in both)\n\nSo E's containing Y^- or Z^-: 7, including itself. So other E's containing Y^- or Z^-: 6. So disjoint = 12 − 1 (itself) − 6 = 5. Yes.\n\nSo each of 12 E's has 5 disjoint partners.\n\nSo total ordered pairs = 12 × 5 = 60  \nBut each unordered pair counted twice → number of unordered disjoint E+E pairs = 60 / 2 = 30\n\n✅ Case 4 contributes **30**\n\n---\n\nNow sum all cases:\n\n- C+C: 12  \n- C+E: 48  \n- C+F: 24  \n- E+E: 30  \n\nTotal = 12 + 48 = 60; 60 + 24 = 84; 84 + 30 = 114\n\nSo total number of ways to choose two positions such that red is visible on exactly 4 faces = **114**\n\nBut wait — is that the final answer?\n\nLet’s double-check if any case was missed or overcounted.\n\nEarlier we excluded C+I, E+I, etc., correctly.\n\nAlso, note: the problem says “assemble 2 red and 25 white cubes”, and “rotations and reflections are considered distinct”, meaning we count all placements as distinct — which we did, since we counted position pairs in the fixed 3×3×3 grid.\n\nSo answer should be 114.\n\nBut let’s sanity check with total possible placements: $ \\binom{27}{2} = 351 $. 114 is about 1/3, plausible.\n\nAlternative way: write a quick mental script — but we’ll trust the case analysis.\n\nSo answer to Problem 2 is **114**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n- Problem 1: $ m = 2 $  \n- Problem 2: $ 114 $\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Given constraints |A|=|B|=|C|=4, |A∩B|=|B∩C|=|C∩A|=2, and the condition that no element belongs to exactly two sets, the pairwise intersections must equal the triple intersection.
