  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-step problem. Let's parse and solve it carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of $ Q(x) $\n\nWe are told:\n\n- $ P $ is a polynomial of degree 2015.\n- $ P(n) = \\frac{1}{n^2} $ for $ n = 1, 2, \\dots, 2016 $.\n- Define auxiliary polynomial:  \n  $$ Q(x) = x^2 P(x) - 1 $$\n\nSince $ P $ has degree 2015, $ x^2 P(x) $ has degree $ 2017 $, so $ Q(x) $ is a degree-2017 polynomial.\n\nAlso, for $ n = 1 $ to $ 2016 $, we have:\n$$\nQ(n) = n^2 P(n) - 1 = n^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{n^2} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0\n$$\nSo $ Q(x) $ has roots at $ x = 1, 2, \\dots, 2016 $. That’s **2016 distinct roots**.\n\nThus, $ Q(x) $ is divisible by:\n$$\n(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-2016)\n$$\nwhich is a degree-2016 polynomial.\n\nSince $ Q(x) $ has degree 2017, the quotient must be linear:\n$$\nQ(x) = c(x - 1)(x - 2)\\cdots(x - 2016)(x - r)\n$$\nfor some constant $ c $ and some root $ r $ (possibly not integer).\n\nBut wait — we can determine $ Q(0) $ directly from definition:\n$$\nQ(0) = 0^2 \\cdot P(0) - 1 = -1\n$$\nHold on! Is that correct?\n\nYes: $ Q(x) = x^2 P(x) - 1 $, so plugging $ x = 0 $ gives $ Q(0) = 0^2 \\cdot P(0) - 1 = -1 $. So $ Q(0) = -1 $, regardless of $ P(0) $.\n\nThen $ d = Q(0) + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4 $.\n\nWait — is that too quick? Let's double-check.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n> Instead of finding the floor of the product [...] simply find $ d = Q(0) + 5 $, where $ Q(x) = x^{2} P(x) - 1 $ is the auxiliary polynomial derived from the given interpolation condition.\n\nSo yes, $ Q(0) = 0^2 \\cdot P(0) - 1 = -1 $, always. So $ d = -1 + 5 = 4 $.\n\nBut hold on — is $ P(x) $ defined at 0? Yes, it's a polynomial, so it's defined everywhere. And $ x^2 P(x) $ is also a polynomial, so $ Q(x) $ is a polynomial, and evaluating at 0 is fine.\n\nSo $ Q(0) = -1 $, hence $ d = 4 $.\n\nLet’s verify consistency: Does $ Q(x) = x^2 P(x) - 1 $ having roots at $ x = 1 $ to $ 2016 $, and degree 2017, imply anything about $ Q(0) $? Well, yes — but our direct evaluation is valid and doesn’t require knowing $ P(0) $, because the $ x^2 $ factor kills it.\n\nSo $ d = 4 $.\n\n✅ So $ d = 4 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use $ d = 4 $ in the next part.\n\nWe are told:\n\n> In the polynomial  \n> $$ x^{d} - 18x^{3} + kx^{2} + 200x - 1984 = 0, $$  \n> the product of $ (d - 2) $ of its roots is $ (d - 36) $. Find $ k $.\n\nWe now know $ d = 4 $, so plug in:\n\n- Polynomial becomes:\n  $$\n  x^4 - 18x^3 + kx^2 + 200x - 1984 = 0\n  $$\n  (since $ d = 4 $, $ x^d = x^4 $)\n\n- $ d - 2 = 2 $, so “the product of $ (d - 2) = 2 $ of its roots” means: product of **two** of its roots equals $ d - 36 = 4 - 36 = -32 $.\n\nBut which two? It says “the product of $ (d - 2) $ of its roots is $ (d - 36) $”. That phrasing is ambiguous — does it mean *some* two roots multiply to $-32$, or *any* two, or *the sum over all products of two roots*, i.e., elementary symmetric sum $ e_2 $?\n\nLet’s examine standard interpretations.\n\nFor a degree-$ n $ monic polynomial:\n$$\nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_0 = 0,\n$$\nthe elementary symmetric sums of roots $ r_1, \\dots, r_n $ satisfy:\n\n- $ \\sum r_i = -a_{n-1} $\n- $ \\sum_{i<j} r_i r_j = a_{n-2} $\n- $ \\sum_{i<j<k} r_i r_j r_k = -a_{n-3} $\n- $ r_1 r_2 \\dots r_n = (-1)^n a_0 $\n\nIn our case, polynomial is:\n\n$$\nx^4 - 18x^3 + kx^2 + 200x - 1984\n$$\n\nSo coefficients:\n\n- $ a_3 = -18 $ → sum of roots $ = 18 $\n- $ a_2 = k $ → sum of pairwise products $ = k $\n- $ a_1 = 200 $ → sum of triple products $ = -200 $\n- $ a_0 = -1984 $ → product of all four roots $ = (+1)(-1984) = -1984 $, since $ (-1)^4 = 1 $\n\nNow the phrase: “the product of $ (d - 2) = 2 $ of its roots is $ (d - 36) = -32 $”.\n\nThat sounds like: *there exists a pair of roots whose product is $-32$*. But that alone doesn’t determine $k$, unless more is known.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's misphrased and actually means: *the sum of the products of roots taken $ (d-2) $ at a time* — i.e., the elementary symmetric sum $ e_{d-2} = e_2 $ — equals $ d - 36 = -32 $. That would make sense: $ e_2 = k = -32 $. Then answer is $ k = -32 $. But let's test if that fits.\n\nBut wait — the problem says: “the product of $ (d - 2) $ of its roots is $ (d - 36) $”. Grammatically, “product of 2 of its roots” usually means product of *some* two — but in contest math, sometimes it's shorthand for the elementary symmetric sum — but that's \"sum of products\", not \"product\".\n\nAlternatively, could it mean the product of *all but* $ (d-2) = 2 $ roots? That is, product of $ d - (d-2) = 2 $ roots? No, same.\n\nWait, re-read: “the product of $ (d - 2) $ of its roots is $ (d - 36) $”.\n\nThat is: choose $ d-2 = 2 $ roots out of $ d = 4 $, and take their product — and that product equals $ d - 36 = -32 $. But there are $ \\binom{4}{2} = 6 $ such products. Which one? It must be that **all** such pairwise products equal $-32$? Impossible unless all roots equal (but then product would be square, etc.) — unlikely.\n\nAlternative interpretation: Maybe it's saying that the product of **exactly $ d-2 $ roots**, i.e., 2 roots, *when the other $ d - (d-2) = 2 $ roots are fixed somehow*? Unclear.\n\nLet’s consider factoring possibility.\n\nGiven polynomial:\n$$\nx^4 - 18x^3 + kx^2 + 200x - 1984\n$$\n\nSuppose it factors as quadratics:\n$$\n(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)\n$$\n\nThen expanding:\n\n- $ x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd $\n\nMatch coefficients:\n\n- $ a + c = -18 $\n- $ ac + b + d = k $\n- $ ad + bc = 200 $\n- $ bd = -1984 $\n\nWe’re told that product of *two* roots is $-32$. So perhaps $ b = -32 $ or $ d = -32 $, or one quadratic has constant term $-32$, meaning its roots multiply to $-32$.\n\nIndeed, if one quadratic factor is $ x^2 + px - 32 $, then its roots multiply to $-32$. That matches “product of 2 of its roots is $-32$”.\n\nSo suppose $ b = -32 $. Then $ bd = -1984 \\implies d = \\frac{-1984}{-32} = 62 $.\n\nSo $ b = -32, d = 62 $.\n\nThen:\n\n- $ a + c = -18 $\n- $ ad + bc = a\\cdot 62 + c \\cdot (-32) = 62a - 32c = 200 $\n- And $ k = ac + b + d = ac - 32 + 62 = ac + 30 $\n\nNow solve:\n\nFrom $ a + c = -18 $, so $ c = -18 - a $\n\nPlug into $ 62a - 32c = 200 $:\n\n$$\n62a - 32(-18 - a) = 200 \\\\\n62a + 576 + 32a = 200 \\\\\n94a = 200 - 576 = -376 \\\\\na = -376 / 94 = -4\n$$\n\nCheck: $ 94 \\times 4 = 376 $, yes → $ a = -4 $\n\nThen $ c = -18 - (-4) = -14 $\n\nNow compute $ k = ac + 30 = (-4)(-14) + 30 = 56 + 30 = 86 $\n\nSo $ k = 86 $\n\nLet’s verify full factorization:\n\n- First quadratic: $ x^2 + ax + b = x^2 - 4x - 32 $\n- Second: $ x^2 + cx + d = x^2 -14x + 62 $\n\nMultiply:\n\n- $ (x^2 - 4x - 32)(x^2 -14x + 62) $\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n1. $ x^2 \\cdot (x^2 -14x + 62) = x^4 -14x^3 + 62x^2 $\n2. $ -4x \\cdot (x^2 -14x + 62) = -4x^3 + 56x^2 - 248x $\n3. $ -32 \\cdot (x^2 -14x + 62) = -32x^2 + 448x - 1984 $\n\nAdd:\n\n- $ x^4 $\n- $ x^3 $: $ -14 -4 = -18 $ → OK\n- $ x^2 $: $ 62 + 56 - 32 = 86 $ → matches $ k = 86 $\n- $ x $: $ -248 + 448 = 200 $ → OK\n- constant: $ -1984 $ → OK\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnd indeed, roots of $ x^2 - 4x - 32 = 0 $ are $ \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 128}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 12}{2} = 8, -4 $, product $ 8 \\cdot (-4) = -32 $. So yes — two roots multiply to $-32$.\n\nThus $ k = 86 $.\n\nTherefore, answer is $ 86 $.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given P(n) = 1/n² for n = 1 to 2016, and P is degree 2015. Define Q(x) = x²P(x) − 1. Since P(n) = 1/n², Q(n) = 0 for n = 1 to 2016, so Q has those 2016 roots. Q is degree 2017 because x²P(x) is degree 2017. Evaluating Q(0) = 0²·P(0) − 1 = −1. Thus d = Q(0) + 5 = −1 + 5 = 4. Now consider the polynomial x⁴ − 18x³ + kx² + 200x − 1984 = 0. The condition states that the product of (d−2) = 2 of its roots is (d−36) = −32. Factoring the quartic as (x² − 4x − 32)(x² − 14x + 62) yields roots whose product in the first quadratic is −32, matching the condition. Expanding gives coefficient of x² as k = 86.\",\n    \"answer\": \"86\"\n}",
