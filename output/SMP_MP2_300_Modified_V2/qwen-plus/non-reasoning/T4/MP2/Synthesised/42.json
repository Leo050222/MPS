Then define $m = c - 476$, where $c$ is the positive integer appearing in the term $(c, ab)$.

Solve the system...\"* — but no specific $n$ is given. However, perhaps the system has a unique solution independent of $n$, or maybe only one value of $c$ makes the first equation hold, giving a unique $m$, and then the second system may have a unique solution (e.g., all $x_i = 1$ or something), and the answer is to output $m$? Wait — no, the final instruction says:\n\n> Instead of determining the positive integers satisfying the given equation on greatest common divisors, simply find $m = c - 476$, where $c$ is the positive integer appearing in the term $(c, ab)$. Let $n$ be a given positive integer. Solve the system [...] in the set of nonnegative real numbers.\n\nThen it says: \"After your reasoning, provide your final answer in the exact JSON format...\"\n\nSo what is the *final answer*? It must be the solution to the system — but the system depends on $n$ and $m$. However, the problem doesn’t specify $n$, nor ask for a formula — it says “solve the system”, implying perhaps there's a unique solution (maybe all $x_i = 1$?), and the answer is that solution — but how to represent a tuple of $n$ variables? That seems ambiguous.\n\nWait — re-read the problem statement again carefully.\n\n> Solve the equation [...] in positive integers. (Here $(x,y)$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$.) Instead of determining the positive integers satisfying the given equation on greatest common divisors, simply find $m = c - 476$, where $c$ is the positive integer appearing in the term $(c, ab)$. Let $n$ be a given positive integer. Solve the system [...] in the set of nonnegative real numbers.\n\nSo the problem wants us to:\n\n- Find $m = c - 476$, where $c$ appears in $(c, ab)$ in a solution $(a,b,c)$ of the gcd equation.\n- Then, *for that $m$*, solve the system (presumably for general $n$) — but the answer format expects a single value in quotes.\n\nPossibility: The system has a unique solution for all $n$, and the solution is something simple like $x_1 = x_2 = \\dots = x_n = 1$, and maybe the answer is that — but the JSON expects a single value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that only one triple $(a,b,c)$ satisfies the first equation, giving a unique $c$, hence unique $m$, and then the second system has a unique solution whose *sum* or some function is constant — but the problem says “solve the system”, not “find the sum”.\n\nWait — maybe the problem is ill-posed or from a contest where standard assumptions apply.\n\nLet’s step back and try to solve the first equation.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the gcd equation\n\nWe need positive integers $a,b,c$ such that:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a^2, b^2) + \\gcd(a, bc) + \\gcd(b, ac) + \\gcd(c, ab) = 199.\n\\]\n\nRecall:\n\n- $\\gcd(a^2,b^2) = \\gcd(a,b)^2$. Let $d = \\gcd(a,b)$. So $a = d a'$, $b = d b'$, with $\\gcd(a',b') = 1$.\n\nThen:\n\n- $\\gcd(a^2,b^2) = d^2$.\n\n- $\\gcd(a, bc) = \\gcd(d a', d b' c) = d \\cdot \\gcd(a', b' c)$. Since $\\gcd(a',b') = 1$, $\\gcd(a', b' c) = \\gcd(a', c)$.\n\nSo $\\gcd(a, bc) = d \\cdot \\gcd(a', c)$.\n\n- Similarly, $\\gcd(b, ac) = \\gcd(d b', d a' c) = d \\cdot \\gcd(b', a' c) = d \\cdot \\gcd(b', c)$, since $\\gcd(b', a') = 1$.\n\n- $\\gcd(c, ab) = \\gcd(c, d^2 a' b')$. Since $\\gcd(a',b') = 1$, this is $\\gcd(c, d^2) \\cdot \\gcd(c, a') \\cdot \\gcd(c, b')$? Not quite — gcd is not multiplicative over products unless arguments are coprime. Actually, $\\gcd(c, d^2 a' b') = \\gcd(c, d^2) \\cdot \\gcd(c, a') \\cdot \\gcd(c, b')$ only if $d^2$, $a'$, $b'$ are pairwise coprime — but $a'$ and $b'$ are coprime, but $d$ may share factors with $c$, and $a', b'$ may share factors with $c$.\n\nThis is getting messy.\n\nTry small values.\n\nNote 199 is prime. So the sum of four positive integers equals a prime ⇒ likely three of them are 1, and one is 196? Or other combos: e.g., 1+1+1+196, 1+1+2+195, etc. But gcds are at least 1, so minimum sum is 4. So possible.\n\nSince all terms are positive integers ≥ 1, and sum is 199, which is odd, the number of odd terms must be odd.\n\nBut more promising: try assuming $a = b = 1$. Then:\n\n- $\\gcd(a^2,b^2) = \\gcd(1,1) = 1$\n- $\\gcd(a,bc) = \\gcd(1, c) = 1$\n- $\\gcd(b,ac) = \\gcd(1,c) = 1$\n- $\\gcd(c,ab) = \\gcd(c,1) = 1$\n\nSum = 4 → too small.\n\nTry $a = b = c = k$. Then:\n\n- $\\gcd(a^2,b^2) = k^2$\n- $\\gcd(a,bc) = \\gcd(k, k^2) = k$\n- $\\gcd(b,ac) = k$\n- $\\gcd(c,ab) = \\gcd(k,k^2) = k$\n\nSum = $k^2 + 3k = 199$\n\nSolve $k^2 + 3k - 199 = 0$. Discriminant $9 + 796 = 805$, not square (28²=784, 29²=841), so no integer solution.\n\nTry $a = b$. Let $a = b = t$, $c$ variable.\n\nThen:\n\n- $\\gcd(a^2,b^2) = t^2$\n- $\\gcd(a,bc) = \\gcd(t, t c) = t$\n- $\\gcd(b,ac) = \\gcd(t, t c) = t$\n- $\\gcd(c,ab) = \\gcd(c, t^2)$\n\nSo sum = $t^2 + t + t + \\gcd(c,t^2) = t^2 + 2t + \\gcd(c,t^2) = 199$\n\nSo $t^2 + 2t \\le 199$, and $\\gcd(c,t^2) = 199 - t^2 - 2t$\n\nLet $g = \\gcd(c,t^2)$. So $g \\mid t^2$, and $g = 199 - t^2 - 2t > 0$, so $t^2 + 2t < 199$\n\nTry $t = 13$: $169 + 26 = 195$, so $g = 4$. OK.\n\n$t = 13$: then $g = \\gcd(c,169) = 4$. But 169 = 13², its positive divisors are 1,13,169. So $\\gcd(c,169)$ can only be 1,13, or 169. So $g=4$ impossible.\n\nSo $t$ must be such that $t^2$ has divisor $g = 199 - t^2 - 2t$.\n\nTry $t = 10$: $100 + 20 = 120$, $g = 79$. Does 79 divide 100? No.\n\n$t = 11$: $121 + 22 = 143$, $g = 56$. 56 ∤ 121.\n\n$t = 12$: $144 + 24 = 168$, $g = 31$. 31 ∤ 144.\n\n$t = 14$: $196 + 28 = 224 > 199$, too big.\n\n$t = 9$: $81 + 18 = 99$, $g = 100$. Does 100 divide 81? No.\n\n$t = 8$: $64 + 16 = 80$, $g = 119$. 119 ∤ 64.\n\n$t = 7$: $49 + 14 = 63$, $g = 136$. No.\n\nSo $a = b$ may not work.\n\nTry $a = 1$. Then equation becomes:\n\n- $\\gcd(1,b^2) = 1$\n- $\\gcd(1,bc) = 1$\n- $\\gcd(b,c) $ because $\\gcd(b,1\\cdot c) = \\gcd(b,c)$\n- $\\gcd(c,1\\cdot b) = \\gcd(c,b)$\n\nSo sum = $1 + 1 + \\gcd(b,c) + \\gcd(b,c) = 2 + 2\\gcd(b,c) = 199 \\implies 2\\gcd(b,c) = 197$, impossible (197 odd).\n\nSimilarly, $b = 1$: symmetric, same issue.\n\nTry $c = 1$:\n\nThen:\n\n- $\\gcd(a^2,b^2)$\n- $\\gcd(a,b\\cdot1) = \\gcd(a,b)$\n- $\\gcd(b,a\\cdot1) = \\gcd(a,b)$\n- $\\gcd(1,ab) = 1$\n\nSo sum = $\\gcd(a,b)^2 + 2\\gcd(a,b) + 1 = (\\gcd(a,b)+1)^2$\n\nSet equal to 199: $(d+1)^2 = 199$, but 199 is not a perfect square (14² = 196, 15² = 225). So no.\n\nTry $c = ab$. Then $\\gcd(c,ab) = ab$. That term is large. Suppose $a=1,b=1,c=1$: sum=4. Too small.\n\nWhat if $a,b$ coprime? Let $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$. Then:\n\n- $\\gcd(a^2,b^2) = 1$\n- $\\gcd(a,bc) = \\gcd(a,c)$ since $\\gcd(a,b)=1$\n- $\\gcd(b,ac) = \\gcd(b,c)$\n- $\\gcd(c,ab) = \\gcd(c,a)\\gcd(c,b)$? Not necessarily — only if $a,b$ coprime, then $\\gcd(c,ab) = \\gcd(c,a)\\gcd(c,b)$. Yes! Because if $\\gcd(a,b)=1$, then the prime factors of $a$ and $b$ are disjoint, so $\\gcd(c,ab) = \\gcd(c,a)\\cdot \\gcd(c,b)$.\n\nSo with $\\gcd(a,b)=1$, the sum becomes:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\gcd(a,c) + \\gcd(b,c) + \\gcd(a,c)\\gcd(b,c)\n\\]\n\nLet $x = \\gcd(a,c), y = \\gcd(b,c)$. Since $a,b$ coprime, $x$ and $y$ are coprime as well? Not necessarily — e.g., $c=30, a=6, b=5$: $\\gcd(6,30)=6, \\gcd(5,30)=5$, coprime. In general, if $\\gcd(a,b)=1$, then any common divisor of $a$ and $c$, and $b$ and $c$, must be coprime, because any prime dividing both $x$ and $y$ would divide both $a$ and $b$, contradiction. So $\\gcd(x,y)=1$.\n\nSo sum = $1 + x + y + xy = (x+1)(y+1)$\n\nSo the entire sum is $(x+1)(y+1) = 199$\n\nSince 199 is prime, the only positive integer factorizations are $1 \\times 199$ or $199 \\times 1$\n\nSo either:\n\n- $x+1 = 1, y+1 = 199 \\implies x = 0$, impossible since gcd is at least 1.\n\n- $x+1 = 199, y+1 = 1 \\implies y = 0$, impossible.\n\nBut $x,y \\ge 1$, so $x+1 \\ge 2$, $y+1 \\ge 2$, so product at least 4. But 199 is prime, so cannot be expressed as product of two integers ≥2. Contradiction.\n\nTherefore, assumption $\\gcd(a,b)=1$ leads to no solution.\n\nSo $\\gcd(a,b) = d > 1$\n\nLet’s go back to earlier substitution:\n\nLet $a = d a'$, $b = d b'$, $\\gcd(a',b') = 1$\n\nThen:\n\n- $\\gcd(a^2,b^2) = d^2$\n\n- $\\gcd(a,bc) = \\gcd(d a', d b' c) = d \\cdot \\gcd(a', b' c) = d \\cdot \\gcd(a', c)$, since $\\gcd(a',b') = 1$\n\n- $\\gcd(b,ac) = d \\cdot \\gcd(b', c)$\n\n- $\\gcd(c, ab) = \\gcd(c, d^2 a' b')$\n\nNow, since $\\gcd(a',b') = 1$, we can write $\\gcd(c, d^2 a' b') = \\gcd(c, d^2) \\cdot \\gcd(c, a') \\cdot \\gcd(c, b')$ only if $d^2$, $a'$, $b'$ are pairwise coprime — but $a'$ and $b'$ are coprime, but $d$ may share factors with $a'$ or $b'$? No — we defined $d = \\gcd(a,b)$, and $a = d a'$, $b = d b'$, with $\\gcd(a',b') = 1$, but $a'$ and $d$ may not be coprime. Example: $a = 12, b = 18$, $d = 6$, $a' = 2, b' = 3$, and $\\gcd(a',d) = \\gcd(2,6) = 2 \\ne 1$. So $a'$ and $d$ can share factors.\n\nSo that path is messy.\n\nAlternative idea: Try to minimize all gcds except one.\n\nSuppose $a$ and $b$ are powers of same prime, say $a = p^r$, $b = p^s$, $r \\le s$. Then:\n\n- $\\gcd(a^2,b^2) = p^{2r}$\n- $\\gcd(a,bc) = \\gcd(p^r, p^s c) = p^r \\cdot \\gcd(1, c)$ if $c$ not divisible by $p$? Wait: $\\gcd(p^r, p^s c) = p^{\\min(r,s)} \\cdot \\gcd(1, c)$ if $p \\nmid c$, but actually $\\gcd(p^r, p^s c) = p^{\\min(r,s)} \\cdot \\gcd(1, c)$ only if $p \\nmid c$. More carefully: if $c = p^t c'$, $p \\nmid c'$, then $\\gcd(p^r, p^s \\cdot p^t c') = p^{\\min(r, s+t)}$\n\nThis is getting too involved.\n\nPerhaps the problem is from a known source, and the intended solution is to notice that the maximum possible value of each gcd term is bounded, and 199 is large, so likely $a$ and $b$ are large.\n\nBut wait — the problem says: \"Instead of determining the positive integers satisfying the given equation [...] simply find $m = c - 476$\". So maybe there is a unique $c$ that works, and it's 476 + m, and perhaps $c = 476$, so $m = 0$? But then $m+1 = 1$, and second equation denominator is 1.\n\nOr maybe $c = 477$, $m = 1$.\n\nBut we need to find $c$.\n\nLet’s search for small $c$.\n\nSuppose $c = 199 - 3 = 196$, and other terms are 1. Is it possible that three terms are 1?\n\nFor $\\gcd(a^2,b^2) = 1$ ⇒ $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$\n\n$\\gcd(a,bc) = 1$ ⇒ $\\gcd(a,bc) = 1$. Since $\\gcd(a,b)=1$, this means $\\gcd(a,c) = 1$\n\nSimilarly, $\\gcd(b,ac) = 1$ ⇒ $\\gcd(b,c) = 1$\n\nThen $\\gcd(c,ab) = \\gcd(c,a)\\gcd(c,b) = 1\\cdot1 = 1$, so sum = 4.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSuppose $\\gcd(a^2,b^2) = 196 = 14^2$, so $\\gcd(a,b) = 14$. Let $a = 14a'$, $b = 14b'$, $\\gcd(a',b') = 1$\n\nThen:\n\n- First term = 196\n\n- Second: $\\gcd(a,bc) = \\gcd(14a', 14b' c) = 14 \\cdot \\gcd(a', b' c) = 14 \\cdot \\gcd(a',c)$\n\n- Third: $14 \\cdot \\gcd(b',c)$\n\n- Fourth: $\\gcd(c, ab) = \\gcd(c, 196 a' b')$\n\nTo make sum 199, need the last three terms to sum to 3. Since each is at least 1, must be 1+1+1.\n\nSo:\n\n- $14 \\cdot \\gcd(a',c) = 1$ ⇒ impossible, since 14 > 1.\n\nSo first term can't be 196.\n\nWhat if first term is 100? Then remaining sum is 99.\n\nBut this trial and error is inefficient.\n\nPerhaps the problem is misdirection, and the only way the sum is 199 is if three terms are 1 and one is 196, but as seen, $\\gcd(a,bc) \\ge \\gcd(a,b)$, etc.\n\nWait, another idea: Use inequality.\n\nWe know:\n\n- $\\gcd(a^2,b^2) = \\gcd(a,b)^2 \\ge 1$\n\n- $\\gcd(a,bc) \\ge \\gcd(a,b)$, because $b$ divides $bc$, so common divisors of $a$ and $b$ divide $a$ and $bc$.\n\nSimilarly, $\\gcd(b,ac) \\ge \\gcd(a,b)$\n\n- $\\gcd(c,ab) \\ge 1$\n\nSo sum $\\ge \\gcd(a,b)^2 + 2\\gcd(a,b) + 1 = (\\gcd(a,b)+1)^2$\n\nSo $(d+1)^2 \\le 199 \\implies d+1 \\le \\lfloor \\sqrt{199} \\rfloor = 14$, so $d \\le 13$\n\nAlso, upper bound: each term ≤ max of its arguments, but not helpful.\n\nSo $d = \\gcd(a,b) \\in [1,13]$\n\nThen $(d+1)^2 \\le 199$, and equality would require the other gcds to be minimal, i.e., $\\gcd(a,bc) = d$, $\\gcd(b,ac) = d$, $\\gcd(c,ab) = 1$\n\nIs that possible?\n\nIf $\\gcd(a,bc) = d$, and $a = d a'$, $b = d b'$, $\\gcd(a',b') = 1$, then $\\gcd(a,bc) = d \\cdot \\gcd(a', b' c) = d$ implies $\\gcd(a', b' c) = 1$. Since $\\gcd(a',b') = 1$, this means $\\gcd(a',c) = 1$\n\nSimilarly, $\\gcd(b,ac) = d$ implies $\\gcd(b',c) = 1$\n\nThen $\\gcd(c,ab) = \\gcd(c, d^2 a' b')$. Since $\\gcd(c,a') = \\gcd(c,b') = 1$, this equals $\\gcd(c,d^2)$\n\nSo sum = $d^2 + d + d + \\gcd(c,d^2) = d^2 + 2d + g$, where $g = \\gcd(c,d^2) \\le d^2$\n\nSet equal to 199: $d^2 + 2d + g = 199 \\implies g = 199 - d^2 - 2d$\n\nAnd $g$ must be a positive divisor of $d^2$\n\nTry $d = 13$: $169 + 26 = 195$, $g = 4$. Divisors of $169 = 13^2$ are 1,13,169. 4 not among them.\n\n$d = 12$: $144 + 24 = 168$, $g = 31$. $12^2 = 144$, 31 ∤ 144.\n\n$d = 11$: $121 + 22 = 143$, $g = 56$. $11^2 = 121$, 56 ∤ 121.\n\n$d = 10$: $100 + 20 = 120$, $g = 79$. $10^2 = 100$, no.\n\n$d = 9$: $81 + 18 = 99$, $g = 100$. $9^2 = 81$, no.\n\n$d = 8$: $64 + 16 = 80$, $g = 119$. $64$, no.\n\n$d = 7$: $49 + 14 = 63$, $g = 136$. $49$, no.\n\n$d = 6$: $36 + 12 = 48$, $g = 151$. $36$, no.\n\n$d = 5$: $25 + 10 = 35$, $g = 164$. $25$, no.\n\n$d = 4$: $16 + 8 = 24$, $g = 175$. $16$, no.\n\n$d = 3$: $9 + 6 = 15$, $g = 184$. $9$, no.\n\n$d = 2$: $4 + 4 = 8$, $g = 191$. $4$, no.\n\n$d = 1$: $1 + 2 = 3$, $g = 196$. $1^2 = 1$, only divisor is 1, but 196 ≠ 1.\n\nNone work. So our assumption that $\\gcd(a,bc) = d$ and $\\gcd(b,ac) = d$ is invalid.\n\nPerhaps $\\gcd(a,bc) = 1$, which requires $a$ and $bc$ coprime, so $a = 1$, but we saw that gives sum = 2 + 2\\gcd(b,c), even, can't be 199.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the nature of the problem, perhaps the intended answer is that $m = 0$, i.e., $c = 476$, and then the second system has a nice solution.\n\nBut why 476? 476 = 2^2 * 7 * 17. Not obvious.\n\nPerhaps the problem is defective or from a specific contest with known answer.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the equation has solution $a = 1, b = 199, c = 1$, let's test:\n\n- $\\gcd(1, 199^2) = 1$\n- $\\gcd(1, 199*1) = 1$\n- $\\gcd(199, 1*1) = 1$\n- $\\gcd(1, 1*199) = 1$\nSum = 4.\n\nNo.\n\nTry $a = 199, b = 1, c = 1$: same.\n\nTry $a = 199, b = 199, c = 1$: then\n\n- $\\gcd(a^2,b^2) = 199^2 = 39601$, way too big.\n\nSo not.\n\nGiven the time, and that the problem asks for $m = c - 476$, and then to solve the system, but the final answer format expects a single value, and the system's right-hand side is $\\frac{n(n+m)}{m+1}$, perhaps for the system to have nonnegative real solutions, the RHS must be at least the minimum possible value of the left-hand side.\n\nBy Power Mean or Jensen, for nonnegative $x_i$, we have $x_i^i \\ge i x_i - i + 1$? Not sure.\n\nFor each $i$, by AM-GM or Bernoulli, but perhaps equality when all $x_i = 1$:\n\nIf $x_i = 1$ for all $i$, then first equation: $1 + 1^2 + 1^3 + \\dots + 1^n = n$ ✓\n\nSecond equation: $1 + 2*1 + 3*1 + \\dots + n*1 = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$\n\nSo RHS must equal $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \\frac{n(n+m)}{m+1}$\n\nSo $\\frac{n+1}{2} = \\frac{n+m}{m+1}$\n\nMultiply both sides by $2(m+1)$:\n\n$(n+1)(m+1) = 2(n+m)$\n\nExpand: $n m + n + m + 1 = 2n + 2m$\n\nBring all to one side: $n m + n + m + 1 - 2n - 2m = 0 \\implies n m - n - m + 1 = 0 \\implies (n-1)(m-1) = 0$\n\nSo either $n = 1$ or $m = 1$\n\nSince $n$ is any given positive integer, for the equality to hold for all $n$, we need $m = 1$\n\nThus $m = 1$, so $c = 477$\n\nThen the solution to the system is $x_i = 1$ for all $i$, and the answer might be \"1\" or the tuple, but the format wants a single value.\n\nThe problem says \"Solve the system [...] in the set of nonnegative real numbers.\" and then \"provide your final answer\".\n\nIn many contexts, \"solve\" means give the solution, but JSON expects a single value. Perhaps the answer is $m = 1$\n\nGiven that, and the reasoning above leading to $m = 1$ as the only value making the system consistent with $x_i = 1$, and 199 is prime, perhaps the intended $m$ is 1.\n\nSo $m = 1$\n\nThen final answer is \"1\"\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The gcd equation sum is 199, a prime.
