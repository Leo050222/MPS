  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-step problem. Let's parse and solve it carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of $ k $ and compute $ s = k - 1 $\n\n> Determine all integers $ k \\ge 2 $ such that for all pairs $ (m, n) $ of **different positive integers not greater than $ k $**, the number  \n> $$ n^{n-1} - m^{m-1} $$  \n> is **not divisible by $ k $**.\n\nThen:\n\n> Instead of determining all integers at least 2 such that no difference of the specified powered terms between distinct bases up to that integer is divisible by it, simply find $ s = k - 1 $, where $ k $ is the **smallest integer $ \\ge 2 $** for which **at least one such difference** between distinct bases up to $ k $ is divisible by $ k $.\n\nSo we need the **smallest $ k \\ge 2 $** such that there exist distinct $ m, n \\in \\{1, 2, ..., k\\} $ with  \n$$\nk \\mid \\left( n^{n-1} - m^{m-1} \\right)\n$$\n\nThen define $ s = k - 1 $.\n\nLet’s compute values for small $ k $.\n\nWe’ll compute $ a_i = i^{i-1} $ for $ i = 1, 2, 3, \\dots $, then check whether any two distinct $ a_i, a_j $ are congruent modulo $ k $, i.e., $ a_i \\equiv a_j \\pmod{k} $.\n\nBecause if $ a_n \\equiv a_m \\pmod{k} $, then $ a_n - a_m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{k} $, i.e., divisible by $ k $.\n\nSo we want smallest $ k \\ge 2 $ such that among $ a_1, a_2, ..., a_k $, there is a collision modulo $ k $.\n\nCompute $ a_i = i^{i-1} $:\n\n- $ a_1 = 1^{0} = 1 $\n- $ a_2 = 2^{1} = 2 $\n- $ a_3 = 3^{2} = 9 $\n- $ a_4 = 4^{3} = 64 $\n- $ a_5 = 5^{4} = 625 $\n- $ a_6 = 6^{5} = 7776 $\n- $ a_7 = 7^{6} = 117649 $\n- $ a_8 = 8^{7} = 2097152 $\n- etc.\n\nNow test small $ k $:\n\n#### $ k = 2 $: values $ a_1 = 1 $, $ a_2 = 2 $. Mod 2: $ a_1 \\equiv 1 $, $ a_2 \\equiv 0 $. Distinct ⇒ no collision ⇒ no divisible difference.\n\n#### $ k = 3 $: $ a_1 = 1 $, $ a_2 = 2 $, $ a_3 = 9 $. Mod 3:  \n- $ a_1 \\equiv 1 $  \n- $ a_2 \\equiv 2 $  \n- $ a_3 \\equiv 0 $  \nAll distinct mod 3 ⇒ no collision.\n\n#### $ k = 4 $: $ a_1 = 1 $, $ a_2 = 2 $, $ a_3 = 9 $, $ a_4 = 64 $. Mod 4:  \n- $ a_1 \\equiv 1 $  \n- $ a_2 \\equiv 2 $  \n- $ a_3 = 9 \\equiv 1 $  \n- So $ a_1 \\equiv a_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} $, and $ 1 \\ne 3 $, so distinct indices.\n\nThus $ a_3 - a_1 = 9 - 1 = 8 $, divisible by 4.\n\n✅ So $ k = 4 $ works: there exists a pair $ (m,n) = (1,3) $, both ≤ 4 and distinct, such that $ n^{n-1} - m^{m-1} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} $.\n\nIs there a smaller $ k $? We checked $ k = 2, 3 $ — no collision. So smallest $ k = 4 $.\n\nHence $ s = k - 1 = 3 $.\n\n✅ So $ s = 3 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use $ s = 3 $\n\n> $ (s + 2017) = 3 + 2017 = 2020 $ positive integers are written in one line.\n\nSo we have a sequence of 2020 positive integers:  \n$ x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{2020} $, all positive integers.\n\n> Each of them **starting with the $ s $-th** is divisible by previous and by the sum of two previous numbers.\n\nSince $ s = 3 $, “starting with the $ s $-th” means from $ x_3 $ onward: for all $ i \\ge 3 $,  \n- $ x_i $ is divisible by $ x_{i-1} $, and  \n- $ x_i $ is divisible by $ x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} $.\n\nSo for all $ i \\ge 3 $:\n- $ x_{i-1} \\mid x_i $, and  \n- $ x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} \\mid x_i $.\n\nWe are to find the **smallest possible value of the last number**, i.e., minimize $ x_{2020} $, given that all $ x_i $ are positive integers.\n\nWe want minimal growth — likely achieved by making each $ x_i $ equal to the **least common multiple** (LCM) of $ x_{i-1} $ and $ x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} $, but perhaps even smaller: since divisibility only requires $ x_i $ to be a common multiple, the minimal choice is the **least common multiple**, or possibly just the product if they’re coprime — but to minimize, we want the LCM.\n\nBut maybe we can choose initial terms cleverly to keep everything small.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nLet $ x_1 = a $, $ x_2 = b $, positive integers.\n\nThen:\n\n- $ x_3 $ must be divisible by $ x_2 = b $ and by $ x_1 + x_2 = a + b $. So minimal $ x_3 = \\mathrm{lcm}(b, a+b) $.\n\n- $ x_4 $ must be divisible by $ x_3 $ and by $ x_2 + x_3 = b + x_3 $. So $ x_4 = \\mathrm{lcm}(x_3, b + x_3) $.\n\nThis seems messy. Perhaps try small initial values.\n\nTry $ x_1 = 1 $, $ x_2 = 1 $.\n\nThen:\n\n- $ x_3 $ divisible by $ x_2 = 1 $ (always true), and by $ x_1 + x_2 = 2 $. So minimal $ x_3 = 2 $.\n\n- $ x_4 $ divisible by $ x_3 = 2 $, and by $ x_2 + x_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 $. So $ x_4 = \\mathrm{lcm}(2,3) = 6 $.\n\n- $ x_5 $ divisible by $ x_4 = 6 $, and by $ x_3 + x_4 = 2 + 6 = 8 $. So need multiple of $ \\mathrm{lcm}(6,8) = 24 $. So $ x_5 = 24 $.\n\n- $ x_6 $ divisible by $ x_5 = 24 $, and by $ x_4 + x_5 = 6 + 24 = 30 $. $ \\mathrm{lcm}(24,30) = \\mathrm{lcm}(2^3\\cdot3, 2\\cdot3\\cdot5) = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 120 $. So $ x_6 = 120 $.\n\n- $ x_7 $: divisible by 120 and by $ x_5 + x_6 = 24 + 120 = 144 $. $ \\mathrm{lcm}(120,144) $: factor:\n\n  - $ 120 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 $  \n  - $ 144 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 $  \n  - LCM = $ 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = 16 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 = 720 $\n\nSo $ x_7 = 720 $.\n\n- $ x_8 $: divisible by 720 and by $ x_6 + x_7 = 120 + 720 = 840 $. Compute $ \\mathrm{lcm}(720, 840) $:\n\n  - $ 720 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 $  \n  - $ 840 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 $  \n  - LCM = $ 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 16 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = (144) \\cdot 35 = 5040 $\n\nSo $ x_8 = 5040 $.\n\nSequence so far:\n\n- $ x_1 = 1 $  \n- $ x_2 = 1 $  \n- $ x_3 = 2 $  \n- $ x_4 = 6 $  \n- $ x_5 = 24 $  \n- $ x_6 = 120 $  \n- $ x_7 = 720 $  \n- $ x_8 = 5040 $  \n\nThese are factorials! Indeed:\n\n- $ 1 = 1! $  \n- $ 1 = 1! $ or $ 0! = 1 $, but $ x_3 = 2 = 2! $, $ x_4 = 6 = 3! $, $ x_5 = 24 = 4! $, $ x_6 = 120 = 5! $, $ x_7 = 720 = 6! $, $ x_8 = 5040 = 7! $\n\nSo pattern: $ x_n = (n-1)! $ for $ n \\ge 3 $? Let's verify:\n\n- $ x_3 = 2 = 2! = (3-1)! $ ✅  \n- $ x_4 = 6 = 3! = (4-1)! $ ✅  \n- Yes.\n\nSo conjecture: with $ x_1 = x_2 = 1 $, we get $ x_n = (n-1)! $ for $ n \\ge 3 $.\n\nLet’s verify recurrence:\n\nAssume $ x_{n-2} = (n-3)! $, $ x_{n-1} = (n-2)! $. Then:\n\n- $ x_{n-1} = (n-2)! $  \n- $ x_{n-2} + x_{n-1} = (n-3)! + (n-2)! = (n-3)! [1 + (n-2)] = (n-3)! (n-1) $\n\nSo $ x_{n-2} + x_{n-1} = (n-3)! (n-1) $\n\nAnd $ x_{n-1} = (n-2)! = (n-3)! (n-2) $\n\nSo LCM of $ (n-3)! (n-2) $ and $ (n-3)! (n-1) $ is $ (n-3)! \\cdot \\mathrm{lcm}(n-2, n-1) $\n\nSince $ n-2 $ and $ n-1 $ are consecutive integers → coprime ⇒ LCM = $ (n-2)(n-1) $\n\nSo LCM = $ (n-3)! (n-2)(n-1) = (n-1)! $\n\nWhich matches $ x_n = (n-1)! $. So yes! The factorial sequence satisfies the condition.\n\nThus with $ x_1 = x_2 = 1 $, we get $ x_n = (n-1)! $ for $ n \\ge 3 $.\n\nSo $ x_{2020} = 2019! $\n\nThat’s huge. But is this the **smallest possible**?\n\nMaybe we can do better with other starting values.\n\nSuppose we try $ x_1 = a $, $ x_2 = b $, and try to keep ratios small.\n\nNote the conditions:\n\nFor $ i \\ge 3 $:\n\n- $ x_i $ is divisible by $ x_{i-1} $ ⇒ $ x_i = x_{i-1} \\cdot r_i $, where $ r_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ $\n\n- Also $ x_i $ divisible by $ x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} $ ⇒ $ x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} \\mid x_i $\n\nSo $ x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} \\mid x_{i-1} \\cdot r_i $ ⇒ $ r_i $ must be multiple of $ \\frac{x_{i-2} + x_{i-1}}{\\gcd(x_{i-1}, x_{i-2} + x_{i-1})} $\n\nLet $ d_i = \\gcd(x_{i-1}, x_{i-2} + x_{i-1}) = \\gcd(x_{i-1}, x_{i-2}) $, since $ \\gcd(a, a+b) = \\gcd(a,b) $.\n\nSo $ d_i = \\gcd(x_{i-1}, x_{i-2}) $\n\nThus minimal $ r_i = \\frac{x_{i-2} + x_{i-1}}{d_i} $, and then $ x_i = x_{i-1} \\cdot \\frac{x_{i-2} + x_{i-1}}{d_i} $\n\nSo recurrence:\n\n$$\nx_i = \\frac{x_{i-1} (x_{i-2} + x_{i-1})}{\\gcd(x_{i-1}, x_{i-2})}\n$$\n\nThat’s a known recurrence? Let's test with $ x_1 = x_2 = 1 $:\n\n- $ \\gcd(1,1) = 1 $, so $ x_3 = \\frac{1 \\cdot (1+1)}{1} = 2 $  \n- $ \\gcd(2,1) = 1 $, $ x_4 = \\frac{2 \\cdot (1+2)}{1} = 6 $  \n- $ \\gcd(6,2) = 2 $, $ x_5 = \\frac{6 \\cdot (2+6)}{2} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 8}{2} = 24 $  \n- $ \\gcd(24,6) = 6 $, $ x_6 = \\frac{24 \\cdot (6+24)}{6} = \\frac{24 \\cdot 30}{6} = 24 \\cdot 5 = 120 $  \n- $ \\gcd(120,24) = 24 $, $ x_7 = \\frac{120 \\cdot (24+120)}{24} = \\frac{120 \\cdot 144}{24} = 120 \\cdot 6 = 720 $  \n- $ \\gcd(720,120) = 120 $, $ x_8 = \\frac{720 \\cdot (120+720)}{120} = \\frac{720 \\cdot 840}{120} = 720 \\cdot 7 = 5040 $\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nSo recurrence is:\n\n$$\nx_i = x_{i-1} \\cdot \\frac{x_{i-2} + x_{i-1}}{\\gcd(x_{i-1}, x_{i-2})}\n$$\n\nTo minimize $ x_{2020} $, we want the multiplicative factors $ \\frac{x_{i-2} + x_{i-1}}{\\gcd(x_{i-1}, x_{i-2})} $ to be as small as possible.\n\nNote that $ \\frac{x_{i-2} + x_{i-1}}{\\gcd(x_{i-1}, x_{i-2})} = \\frac{x_{i-2}}{d} + \\frac{x_{i-1}}{d} $, where $ d = \\gcd $. So if $ x_{i-1} $ and $ x_{i-2} $ are equal, say $ x_{i-1} = x_{i-2} = a $, then $ d = a $, and factor = $ \\frac{a + a}{a} = 2 $. So $ x_i = a \\cdot 2 = 2a $. That’s small.\n\nCan we make all terms equal? Suppose $ x_1 = x_2 = a $. Then:\n\n- $ x_3 = \\frac{a(a + a)}{\\gcd(a,a)} = \\frac{a \\cdot 2a}{a} = 2a $  \n- Now $ x_2 = a $, $ x_3 = 2a $, $ \\gcd(a, 2a) = a $, so  \n  $ x_4 = \\frac{2a (a + 2a)}{a} = \\frac{2a \\cdot 3a}{a} = 6a $  \n- $ x_3 = 2a $, $ x_4 = 6a $, $ \\gcd = 2a $, so  \n  $ x_5 = \\frac{6a (2a + 6a)}{2a} = \\frac{6a \\cdot 8a}{2a} = 6a \\cdot 4 = 24a $  \n- So $ x_n = a \\cdot (n-1)! $ for $ n \\ge 3 $. So scaling initial values by $ a $ scales all later terms by $ a $. Since we want minimal positive integers, best to take $ a = 1 $.\n\nSo $ x_1 = x_2 = 1 $ gives minimal possible growth.\n\nAny other choice? Try $ x_1 = 1 $, $ x_2 = 2 $:\n\n- $ \\gcd(2,1) = 1 $, $ x_3 = \\frac{2(1+2)}{1} = 6 $  \n- $ x_2 = 2 $, $ x_3 = 6 $, $ \\gcd = 2 $, $ x_4 = \\frac{6(2+6)}{2} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 8}{2} = 24 $  \n- $ x_3 = 6 $, $ x_4 = 24 $, $ \\gcd = 6 $, $ x_5 = \\frac{24(6+24)}{6} = \\frac{24 \\cdot 30}{6} = 120 $  \n- So again $ x_3 = 6 = 3! $, $ x_4 = 24 = 4! $, $ x_5 = 120 = 5! $, so from $ x_3 $ onward same as before but shifted: $ x_n = n! $ for $ n \\ge 3 $? Wait:\n\n- $ x_1 = 1 $  \n- $ x_2 = 2 $  \n- $ x_3 = 6 = 3! $  \n- $ x_4 = 24 = 4! $  \n- $ x_5 = 120 = 5! $  \nSo $ x_n = n! $ for $ n \\ge 3 $, meaning $ x_{2020} = 2020! $, larger than $ 2019! $. So worse.\n\nThus minimal is with $ x_1 = x_2 = 1 $, giving $ x_{2020} = 2019! $\n\nBut wait — problem says:\n\n> Each of them starting with the $ s $-th is divisible by previous and by the sum of two previous numbers.\n\n\"Divisible by previous\" means divisible by $ x_{i-1} $, yes.\n\n\"and by the sum of two previous numbers\" — does that mean divisible by $ x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} $, or divisible by each of the two previous numbers? Grammar: \"divisible by previous and by the sum of two previous numbers\" — i.e., divisible by (previous) AND divisible by (sum of two previous). That's how we interpreted.\n\nYes.\n\nSo our interpretation is correct.\n\nHence minimal $ x_{2020} = 2019! $\n\nBut the problem asks:\n\n> What is the smallest value the last number can take?\n\nSo answer is $ 2019! $\n\nBut is that the expected answer? It's enormous; maybe we missed something.\n\nWait — re-read problem statement:\n\n> $(s + 2017)$ positive integers are written in one line. Each of them starting with the $s$-th is divisible by previous and by the sum of two previous numbers.\n\n\"Each of them starting with the $s$-th\" — i.e., for $ i = s, s+1, \\dots, s+2017 $, but total count is $ s + 2017 $, and indexing starts at 1.\n\nLet’s clarify:\n\n- Total numbers: $ s + 2017 $. Let $ N = s + 2017 $. Since $ s = 3 $, $ N = 2020 $, as before.\n\n- \"Each of them starting with the $ s $-th\" means for indices $ i = s, s+1, \\dots, N $, i.e., from position $ s = 3 $ up to position $ 2020 $, inclusive.\n\nSo positions $ i = 3 $ to $ 2020 $ must satisfy the divisibility.\n\nSo $ x_3 $ through $ x_{2020} $ must each be divisible by previous term and by sum of two previous.\n\nSo our analysis holds.\n\nThus minimal last term is $ x_{2020} = 2019! $\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter construction where terms stay small — e.g., constant sequence? Try $ x_i = c $ for all $ i $. Then for $ i \\ge 3 $, need $ c $ divisible by $ c $ (OK), and by $ c + c = 2c $ ⇒ $ 2c \\mid c $ ⇒ only possible if $ c = 0 $, but numbers must be positive. So impossible.\n\nWhat if geometric progression? Say $ x_i = r^{i-1} $. Then $ x_{i-1} = r^{i-2} $, $ x_{i-2} = r^{i-3} $, sum = $ r^{i-3}(1 + r) $. Need $ r^{i-1} $ divisible by $ r^{i-2} $ (OK), and by $ r^{i-3}(1+r) $ ⇒ need $ r^{i-1} / (r^{i-3}(1+r)) = r^2/(1+r) $ integer. So $ 1+r \\mid r^2 $. For integer $ r \\ge 1 $:\n\n- $ r = 1 $: $ 1+1 = 2 $, $ r^2 = 1 $, 2 ∤ 1 → no  \n- $ r = 2 $: $ 3 \\mid 4 $? No  \n- $ r = 3 $: $ 4 \\mid 9 $? No  \n- $ r = 4 $: $ 5 \\mid 16 $? No  \n- $ r = 5 $: $ 6 \\mid 25 $? No  \n- $ r = 8 $: $ 9 \\mid 64 $? No  \n- $ r = 15 $: $ 16 \\mid 225 $? 225/16 = 14.0625 → no  \nHard.\n\nSo factorial seems minimal.\n\nThus answer is $ 2019! $\n\nBut the problem is from A. Gribalko — possibly an olympiad problem — and answers are usually nice numbers. Did we misinterpret $ s $?\n\nLet’s double-check $ s $.\n\nWe found $ k = 4 $ is smallest where some $ n^{n-1} - m^{m-1} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{k} $, with $ 1 \\le m < n \\le k $.\n\nWe had $ m = 1, n = 3 $: $ 3^{2} - 1^{0} = 9 - 1 = 8 $, divisible by 4. Yes.\n\nBut is $ 1^0 $ defined? Yes, conventionally $ 1^0 = 1 $. OK.\n\nBut what about $ m = 2, n = 4 $: $ 4^3 - 2^1 = 64 - 2 = 62 $, 62 mod 4 = 2, not 0.\n\nBut we only need one pair.\n\nIs there a $ k = 2 $ or $ 3 $ we missed?\n\nFor $ k = 2 $: pairs (1,2): $ 2^1 - 1^0 = 2 - 1 = 1 $, not divisible by 2.\n\nOnly pair.\n\nFor $ k = 3 $: pairs (1,2): $ 2 - 1 = 1 $, not div by 3  \n(1,3): $ 9 - 1 = 8 $, 8 mod 3 = 2  \n(2,3): $ 9 - 2 = 7 $, 7 mod 3 = 1  \nSo no.\n\nSo $ k = 4 $, $ s = 3 $ is correct.\n\nThus $ x_{2020} = 2019! $\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the answer as $ 2019! $, and we output that.\n\nHowever, in JSON, we need to write the exact value? But $ 2019! $ is astronomically huge — cannot write decimal.\n\nBut the problem says \"What is the smallest value the last number can take?\" and options aren’t given — it's an open response.\n\nBut in competition problems like this, sometimes the answer is simply $ 2019! $, and you write it as is.\n\nBut the instruction says: \"For numerical answers, provide the exact value\". And \"no LaTeX\".\n\nSo we must write `2019!`? But is that acceptable? Or do they want the integer? Impossible.\n\nLooking back at problem statement: it says \"What is the smallest value the last number can take?\" and it's from A. Gribalko — likely expects $ 2019! $.\n\nAlso, in the example, answer is `\"42\"` — a number. So perhaps they expect the expression? But instructions say \"exact value\", and for huge numbers, factorial notation is standard.\n\nBut let's see if there's a trick.\n\nWait: maybe \"divisible by previous and by the sum of two previous numbers\" means divisible by the previous number **and also** divisible by each of the two previous numbers? i.e., \"the sum of two previous numbers\" is misread.\n\nBut grammar: \"divisible by previous and by the sum of two previous numbers\" — \"previous\" (singular) and \"the sum of two previous numbers\" (singular noun phrase). So it's two things: (1) previous number, (2) sum of two previous numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thought: \"starting with the $ s $-th\" might mean the $ s $-th term has the property, and then every term after that, but the condition applies to each term starting from $ s $, i.e., for $ i \\ge s $, $ x_i $ divisible by $ x_{i-1} $ and by $ x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} $. Which is what we did.\n\nSo I think $ 2019! $ is correct.\n\nThus final answer is `2019!`\n\nBut let's confirm indexing:\n\n- Total terms: $ s + 2017 = 3 + 2017 = 2020 $\n\n- Indices: $ x_1, x_2, ..., x_{2020} $\n\n- Conditions start at $ i = s = 3 $, so $ x_3 $ must be divisible by $ x_2 $ and $ x_1 + x_2 $  \n- $ x_4 $ divisible by $ x_3 $ and $ x_2 + x_3 $  \n- ...  \n- $ x_{2020} $ divisible by $ x_{2019} $ and $ x_{2018} + x_{2019} $\n\nSo yes, $ x_{2020} = 2019! $\n\nTherefore answer is `2019!`\n\nBut in JSON, we write it as a string? The example has `\"42\"` — number in quotes. So `\"2019!\"` is a string, but is that allowed? The instruction says \"for numerical answers, provide the exact value\", and \"put ONLY the answer value in the quotes\". If the answer is a factorial, writing `\"2019!\"` is conventional.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect the answer as a number, but it's impossible.\n\nGiven constraints, `\"2019!\"` is appropriate.\n\nBut let me see if maybe $ s = 3 $ leads to 2020 terms, and the last is $ x_{2020} = (2020 - 1)! = 2019! $. Yes.\n\nSo final answer is `2019!`.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We first find the smallest k ≥ 2 such that there exist distinct m, n ≤ k with k dividing n^{n−1} − m^{m−1}. Testing small k: for k = 2 and k = 3, no such pair exists. For k = 4, m = 1, n = 3 gives 3^2 − 1^0 = 9 − 1 = 8, divisible by 4. Thus k = 4, so s = k − 1 = 3. Then s + 2017 = 2020 positive integers x₁, x₂, …, x₂₀₂₀ are given, with conditions for i ≥ 3: xᵢ divisible by xᵢ₋₁ and by xᵢ₋₂ + xᵢ₋₁. Starting with x₁ = x₂ = 1 yields x₃ = 2, x₄ = 6, x₅ = 24, etc., following xₙ = (n−1)! for n ≥ 3. This satisfies the divisibility conditions and minimizes growth. Hence x₂₀₂₀ = 2019!.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2019!\"\n}",
