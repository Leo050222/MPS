  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\nWe are to count the number $ N $ of **ordered quintuples** of positive integers  \n$$\na \\le b \\le c \\le d \\le e\n$$  \nsuch that:\n\n- Mean = 2023 → sum $ a + b + c + d + e = 5 \\times 2023 = 10115 $\n- Median = 2023 → since there are 5 numbers, median is the third one: $ c = 2023 $\n- The integer 2023 appears **more than once**, and **no other integer appears more than once**.\n\nSo:\n- $ c = 2023 $\n- Since values are non-decreasing and no repeats except for 2023 (and only 2023 may repeat), and it must appear **more than once**, possible multiplicities of 2023 are: **2, 3, 4, or 5 times**, but with constraint that all other numbers are distinct and not equal to 2023.\n\nAlso, since $ a \\le b \\le c \\le d \\le e $, and $ c = 2023 $, then:\n- $ a, b \\le 2023 $\n- $ d, e \\ge 2023 $\n\nAnd all numbers are **positive integers**, so $ a \\ge 1 $.\n\nAlso, \"no other integer appears more than once\" means:\n- If 2023 appears $ k $ times ($k \\ge 2$), then the remaining $5 - k$ positions must be filled with **distinct integers**, all ≠ 2023, and also distinct from each other.\n\nLet’s consider possible cases based on how many times 2023 appears.\n\nLet $ k = $ number of times 2023 appears, $ k = 2, 3, 4, 5 $. But note: since $ c = 2023 $ is fixed as median, and list is sorted, the positions where 2023 can appear are constrained.\n\nBecause list is sorted, if 2023 appears $k$ times, those $k$ copies must occupy **consecutive positions**, and since $c = 2023$, the middle position (3rd) must be among them.\n\nSo possible placements of the $k$ copies of 2023 in positions 1–5 (1-indexed):\n\n- $k = 2$: the two 2023s must include position 3 ⇒ possibilities: positions (2,3), (3,4), or (3, something else? Wait — must be consecutive in sorted list, but since all copies are equal, they will cluster. So yes, in sorted list, equal elements are adjacent. So two 2023s must be in two adjacent positions, one of which is position 3 ⇒ options: (2,3) or (3,4)\n\n- $k = 3$: positions (1,2,3), (2,3,4), or (3,4,5)\n\n- $k = 4$: positions (1,2,3,4), (2,3,4,5)\n\n- $k = 5$: all five positions\n\nBut we also have the condition: **no other integer appears more than once**, i.e., all non-2023 entries are distinct and different from 2023.\n\nAlso, since $a \\le b \\le c \\le d \\le e$, and $c = 2023$, let's denote:\n\nLet’s define variables:\n\nLet $c = 2023$. Then sum is:\n\n$$\na + b + 2023 + d + e = 10115 \\Rightarrow a + b + d + e = 10115 - 2023 = 8092\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\na + b + d + e = 8092 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nAlso, constraints:\n\n- $a, b \\le 2023$, $d, e \\ge 2023$\n- All of $a,b,d,e$ are positive integers\n- Among $a,b,d,e$, any that equal 2023 must be part of the repeated 2023s; but since only 2023 may repeat, and others must be distinct and ≠ 2023, then:\n\nLet’s define how many of $a,b,d,e$ equal 2023.\n\nSince $c = 2023$, total number of 2023s is $1 + $ (# among $a,b,d,e$ that equal 2023). So $k = 1 + t$, where $t =$ number of positions among $\\{a,b,d,e\\}$ equal to 2023. Since $k \\ge 2$, $t \\ge 1$.\n\nAlso, because list is sorted:\n\n- If $a = 2023$, then since $a \\le b \\le c = 2023$, we get $a = b = c = 2023$\n\n- Similarly, if $b = 2023$, then $b = c = 2023$, and $a \\le 2023$\n\n- If $d = 2023$, then $c = d = 2023$, and $e \\ge 2023$\n\n- If $e = 2023$, then $c = d = e = 2023$\n\nSo possible patterns (sorted quintuples) with $c = 2023$, and 2023 appearing $k$ times, and all other entries distinct and ≠ 2023.\n\nLet’s enumerate possible configurations by number of 2023s.\n\n---\n\n#### Case analysis by number $k$ of 2023s:\n\n##### $k = 2$: exactly two 2023s ⇒ one is $c$, another is either $b$ or $d$\n\n- Subcase 1: $b = c = 2023$, so $a < 2023$, $d > 2023$, $e > d$ (since all others distinct and ≠ 2023, and sorted)\n\nBut wait: $d$ and $e$ must be > 2023? Not necessarily >, but ≥, and since they can’t equal 2023 (only two copies), so $d > 2023$, $e > d$ (to ensure distinctness and ordering). Similarly, $a < b = 2023$, and $a$ must be positive integer ≠ 2023, and $b = 2023$, so $a < 2023$, and since all others distinct, $a$ is unique.\n\nAlso $a < b = c = 2023$, so $a \\le 2022$\n\nSimilarly, $d > 2023$, $e > d$, so $d \\ge 2024$, $e \\ge d+1$\n\nAlso $a, d, e$ must be distinct from each other and from 2023 — automatically satisfied if $a < 2023 < d < e$\n\nSo this subcase: $a < 2023$, $b = c = 2023$, $d < e$, both > 2023, all distinct.\n\nSum: $a + 2023 + 2023 + d + e = 10115 \\Rightarrow a + d + e = 10115 - 4046 = 6069$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\na + d + e = 6069,\\quad a \\in [1, 2022],\\quad d \\ge 2024,\\quad e \\ge d+1\n$$\n\nLet’s define $d' = d - 2024 \\ge 0$, $e' = e - (d+1) \\ge 0$, but maybe better to fix $d$, then $e = 6069 - a - d$, and require $e > d$, i.e., $6069 - a - d > d \\Rightarrow 6069 - a > 2d \\Rightarrow d < \\frac{6069 - a}{2}$\n\nAlso $e \\ge d+1$, same inequality.\n\nAlso $e > d \\ge 2024$, and $a \\ge 1$\n\nSo for each $a \\in [1, 2022]$, number of integer pairs $(d,e)$ with:\n\n- $d \\ge 2024$\n- $e > d$\n- $e = 6069 - a - d$\n- So need $6069 - a - d > d \\Rightarrow d < \\frac{6069 - a}{2}$\n- Also $e = 6069 - a - d \\ge d+1 \\Rightarrow 6069 - a - d \\ge d + 1 \\Rightarrow 6068 - a \\ge 2d \\Rightarrow d \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{6068 - a}{2} \\right\\rfloor$\n\nAlso $d \\ge 2024$, and $e = 6069 - a - d \\ge d+1 \\Rightarrow d \\le \\frac{6068 - a}{2}$\n\nAlso $e$ must be integer ⇒ automatically since all are integers.\n\nAlso $e > d \\Rightarrow d < \\frac{6069 - a}{2}$, same bound.\n\nSo for each $a$, number of valid $d$ is:\n\n$$\n\\max\\left(0,\\ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{6068 - a}{2} \\right\\rfloor - 2024 + 1 \\right)\n$$\n\nBecause $d$ integer satisfying $2024 \\le d \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{6068 - a}{2} \\right\\rfloor$\n\nSo count = $ \\max\\left(0,\\ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{6068 - a}{2} \\right\\rfloor - 2023 \\right) $\n\nLet’s find range of $a$ for which this is positive.\n\nWe need:\n\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{6068 - a}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\ge 2024 \\Rightarrow \\frac{6068 - a}{2} \\ge 2024 \\Rightarrow 6068 - a \\ge 4048 \\Rightarrow a \\le 6068 - 4048 = 2020\n$$\n\nSo for $a = 1$ to $2020$, count is positive; for $a = 2021, 2022$, floor((6068−a)/2) = ?\n\n- $a = 2021$: (6068−2021)=4047, /2 = 2023.5 → floor = 2023 < 2024 → count = 0\n\n- $a = 2022$: 6068−2022 = 4046, /2 = 2023 → floor = 2023 → count = 0\n\nSo $a = 1$ to $2020$\n\nNow compute sum over $a = 1$ to $2020$ of:\n\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{6068 - a}{2} \\right\\rfloor - 2023\n$$\n\nLet $f(a) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{6068 - a}{2} \\right\\rfloor - 2023$\n\nNote: $6068 - a$ is integer, so floor division by 2 is just integer division.\n\nLet’s set $x = a$, then $6068 - x$ goes from $6067$ down to $4048$ as $x$ goes 1 to 2020.\n\nSo $6068 - a$ runs from 6067 to 4048 inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: 2020\n\nWe want sum of $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{6068 - a}{2} \\right\\rfloor$ for $a = 1$ to $2020$, minus $2020 \\times 2023$\n\nLet $S = \\sum_{a=1}^{2020} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{6068 - a}{2} \\right\\rfloor = \\sum_{m = 4048}^{6067} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{2} \\right\\rfloor$, where $m = 6068 - a$, so when $a = 1$, $m = 6067$; $a = 2020$, $m = 4048$. So decreasing, but sum same.\n\nSo $S = \\sum_{m = 4048}^{6067} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{2} \\right\\rfloor$\n\nLet’s split into even and odd $m$.\n\nFor integer $m$, $\\lfloor m/2 \\rfloor = m//2$\n\n- If $m = 2k$, floor = $k$\n- If $m = 2k+1$, floor = $k$\n\nSo over consecutive integers, floor(m/2) increases by 1 every 2 steps.\n\nSequence of floor(m/2) for m = 4048 to 6067:\n\n- Length = 6067 − 4048 + 1 = 2020 terms — matches.\n\nLet’s find first and last:\n\n- m = 4048 ⇒ floor = 2024\n- m = 4049 ⇒ floor = 2024\n- m = 4050 ⇒ 2025\n- m = 4051 ⇒ 2025\n- ...\n- m = 6066 ⇒ 3033\n- m = 6067 ⇒ 3033\n\nSo values go from 2024 up to 3033, each appearing **twice**, except possibly at ends? Let's check:\n\n- min floor = 4048/2 = 2024\n- max floor = 6067//2 = 3033 (since 2×3033 = 6066, 6067 = 2×3033 +1)\n\nSo floors take values from 2024 to 3033 inclusive.\n\nHow many integers from 2024 to 3033? 3033 − 2024 + 1 = 1010\n\nEach value appears twice in the sequence of 2020 terms ⇒ perfect! So S = 2 × sum_{i=2024}^{3033} i\n\nSum from 2024 to 3033 = (number of terms) × (first + last)/2 = 1010 × (2024 + 3033)/2 = 1010 × 5057 / 2\n\nCompute 5057 / 2 = 2528.5, but keep fractional? Better compute as:\n\nSum = 1010 × 5057 / 2 = (1010 / 2) × 5057 = 505 × 5057\n\nCompute 505 × 5057:\n\nFirst, 500 × 5057 = 2,528,500  \n5 × 5057 = 25,285  \nSum = 2,553,785\n\nSo S = 2 × that? Wait no: earlier we said S = 2 × sum_{i=2024}^{3033} i = 2 × (505 × 5057) = 2 × 2,553,785 = 5,107,570\n\nWait no: sum_{i=2024}^{3033} i = 505 × 5057 = 2,553,785  \nThen S = 2 × that = 5,107,570? But that would be if each i appears twice — yes.\n\nBut hold on: number of terms in m is 2020, and number of distinct floor values is 1010, each appearing twice ⇒ yes.\n\nSo S = 5,107,570\n\nThen sum of f(a) = S − 2020 × 2023\n\nCompute 2020 × 2023:\n\n2020 × 2000 = 4,040,000  \n2020 × 23 = 2020 × 20 + 2020 × 3 = 40,400 + 6,060 = 46,460  \nTotal = 4,040,000 + 46,460 = 4,086,460\n\nSo sum f(a) = 5,107,570 − 4,086,460 = 1,021,110\n\nSo subcase 1 (b = c = 2023) gives 1,021,110 quintuples.\n\nBut wait — is that correct? Let's sanity check magnitude.\n\nBut hold on — we might be overcomplicating. Perhaps there's symmetry.\n\nAlso, there is symmetric subcase: $c = d = 2023$, i.e., $d = 2023$, $c = 2023$, so $a \\le b < 2023$, $e > 2023$\n\nLet’s check.\n\n##### Subcase 2: $c = d = 2023$, so $k = 2$, with 2023 at positions 3 and 4.\n\nThen $a \\le b < 2023$, $e > 2023$, and all distinct.\n\nSum: $a + b + 2023 + 2023 + e = 10115 \\Rightarrow a + b + e = 6069$, same as before!\n\nConstraints:\n\n- $a \\le b < 2023$, $a,b$ positive integers, distinct from each other and from 2023 ⇒ $1 \\le a < b \\le 2022$\n\n- $e > 2023$, and $e$ distinct ⇒ $e \\ge 2024$\n\nSo $a + b + e = 6069$, $e = 6069 - a - b > 2023 \\Rightarrow a + b < 6069 - 2023 = 4046$\n\nAlso $a < b \\le 2022$, so max $a + b \\le 2021 + 2022 = 4043 < 4046$, so always satisfied.\n\nAlso $e > d = 2023$, and since $d = 2023$, and $e$ must be > d and ≠ 2023, ok.\n\nAlso need $e > d = 2023$, and since list is sorted, $e \\ge d = 2023$, but to be distinct, $e > 2023$\n\nSo $e \\ge 2024$\n\nThus $a + b \\le 6069 - 2024 = 4045$\n\nSince $a < b \\le 2022$, max sum is 2021 + 2022 = 4043, so fine.\n\nSo number of integer pairs $(a,b)$ with $1 \\le a < b \\le 2022$, and $e = 6069 - a - b \\ge 2024$\n\nI.e., $a + b \\le 4045$\n\nBut since max $a+b = 4043$, all such pairs satisfy.\n\nSo total number = number of pairs $1 \\le a < b \\le 2022$\n\nThat is $\\binom{2022}{2} = \\frac{2022 \\times 2021}{2}$\n\nCompute: 2022 × 2021 = ?\n\n2000×2021 = 4,042,000  \n22×2021 = 44,462  \nSum = 4,086,462  \nDivide by 2: 2,043,231\n\nSo subcase 2 yields 2,043,231 quintuples.\n\nWait — but earlier subcase 1 gave 1,021,110, now this is double? That seems inconsistent — why?\n\nBecause in subcase 1, we had $b = c = 2023$, so $a < 2023$, $d > 2023$, $e > d$, with $a + d + e = 6069$\n\nWe computed number of $(a,d,e)$ with those constraints as 1,021,110\n\nIn subcase 2, $c = d = 2023$, $a < b < 2023$, $e > 2023$, with $a + b + e = 6069$, and we counted all $(a,b)$ pairs with $a < b \\le 2022$, which is $\\binom{2022}{2} = 2,043,231$, and for each, $e$ is determined uniquely and satisfies $e > 2023$.\n\nBut is $e$ guaranteed to be > d = 2023? Yes, since $a + b \\le 4043$, so $e = 6069 - a - b \\ge 6069 - 4043 = 2026 > 2023$, ok.\n\nAlso need $e$ distinct from all others — since $e > 2023$, and $a,b < 2023$, yes.\n\nBut in subcase 1, $e$ had to be > d, and d > 2023, so e was larger, but here e just needs to be > 2023, no lower bound relative to d beyond that.\n\nHowever, in subcase 2, d = 2023, so e > d is required for strict increase? No — the condition is \"no other integer appears more than once\", but e could equal d only if e = 2023, but it can't, since only two 2023s already used at c and d. So e ≠ 2023, and since sorted, e ≥ d = 2023, so e ≥ 2024. So ok.\n\nBut now counts differ: subcase 1: ~1M, subcase 2: ~2M. That suggests asymmetry because in subcase 1, d and e both > 2023 and distinct, so more constraints.\n\nBut wait — problem says \"no other integer appears more than once\", but doesn't require strict increase — only that multiplicities are at most 1 except for 2023. So duplicates only allowed for 2023. So in subcase 1, with b=c=2023, we have a < 2023, d > 2023, e > d, so all good.\n\nIn subcase 2, a < b < 2023, e > 2023, so also good.\n\nBut are there more subcases for k=2? What about a=c=2023? But a ≤ b ≤ c, so a=c=2023 implies a=b=c=2023, so k≥3. Similarly, c=e=2023 implies d=e=2023, so k≥3. So only two ways to have exactly two 2023s: (b,c) or (c,d).\n\nSo k=2 contributes: subcase 1 + subcase 2 = 1,021,110 + 2,043,231 = 3,064,341\n\nBut this is getting huge, and the problem asks for $e = N - \\frac{21464546}{7}$. Let's compute that fraction: 21464546 ÷ 7.\n\n7 × 3,066,363 = ? 7×3,000,000=21,000,000; 7×66,363=464,541; total 21,464,541 — close to 21,464,546, difference 5, so 21464546 / 7 = 3,066,363.714... not integer? But N must be integer, so perhaps N is such that N - that is integer.\n\n21464546 ÷ 7: let's compute exactly.\n\n7 × 3,066,363 = 7×3,000,000=21,000,000; 7×66,363= let's compute 66,363×7:\n\n60,000×7=420,000  \n6,363×7=44,541  \nSum 464,541  \nTotal 21,464,541\n\n21464546 − 21464541 = 5, so 21464546 / 7 = 3,066,363 + 5/7\n\nSo $e = N - 3,066,363 - \\frac{5}{7} = (N - 3,066,363) - \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nFor e to be integer, N must be congruent to 5 mod 7? But the problem says \"find e = (N - 21464546/7)\", and presumably e is integer, so N must be such that N - 21464546/7 is integer, i.e., N = 21464546/7 + e, so N = (21464546 + 7e)/7, so 21464546 + 7e must be divisible by 7, which it is, so N is rational, but N is count, so must be integer, so 21464546 + 7e ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 21464546 ≡ 0 mod 7? But we saw remainder 5, so 7e ≡ -5 mod 7 ⇒ e ≡ 2 mod 7. But perhaps e is not necessarily integer? Problem says \"find e = ...\", and doesn't specify type, but likely integer.\n\nThis suggests our earlier approach is wrong — perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me reread Problem 1.\n\n\"Consider positive integers $a \\leq b \\leq c \\leq d \\leq e$. There are $N$ lists $a, b, c, d, e$ with a mean of 2023 and a median of 2023, in which the integer 2023 appears more than once, and in which no other integer appears more than once. What is the sum of the digits of $N$? Instead of computing the sum of the digits of the total number of such ordered quintuples, simply find $e = \\left(N - \\frac{21464546}{7}\\right)$, where $N$ is the total number of such ordered quintuples.\"\n\nAh! It says \"Instead of computing the sum of the digits of $N$, simply find $e = N - 21464546/7$\". So they are telling us to compute that expression, not to find sum of digits. And likely, this expression simplifies to a nice integer.\n\nSo perhaps N = 21464546/7 + e, and e is integer, so N = (21464546 + 7e)/7, and N must be integer, so 21464546 + 7e ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 21464546 ≡ 0 mod 7? But 21464546 mod 7: earlier we had 21464546 - 7*3066363 = 21464546 - 21464541 = 5, so 21464546 ≡ 5 mod 7, so 7e ≡ -5 ≡ 2 mod 7, so e ≡ 2*7^{-1} mod 7. But 7^{-1} mod 7 doesn't exist. Wait, no: 7e ≡ 2 mod 7 ⇒ 0 ≡ 2 mod 7, impossible. Contradiction.\n\nUnless I miscalculated 21464546 / 7.\n\nLet me divide properly:\n\n7 * 3,066,363 = as above 21,464,541\n\n21464546 - 21464541 = 5, yes.\n\nBut perhaps the number is 21,464,546, and /7 is meant to be exact? Maybe it's 21,464,546 = 7 * 3,066,363.714... no.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo, or perhaps we need to compute N exactly, and then compute that expression.\n\nMaybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nWe have a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ e, all positive integers.\n\nc = 2023 (median).\n\nSum = 5*2023 = 10115.\n\nSo a + b + d + e = 8092.\n\n2023 appears more than once, others at most once.\n\nSo the multiset {a,b,c,d,e} has 2023 with multiplicity k ≥ 2, and all other elements distinct and ≠ 2023.\n\nSince c = 2023, the positions of 2023 must include position 3.\n\nLet’s let the number of 2023s be k = 2,3,4,5.\n\nFor each k, the other 5−k positions are filled with distinct integers, all ≠ 2023, and respecting order.\n\nBecause of ordering, the non-2023 elements must be placed in the \"gaps\" around the block of 2023s.\n\nFor example, if k=2, the two 2023s are at positions i and i+1, with i=2 or 3 (since must include 3).\n\n- If at (2,3): then a < 2023, d > 2023, e > d\n\n- If at (3,4): then a ≤ b < 2023, e > 2023\n\nAs before.\n\nFor k=3: three consecutive 2023s including position 3: so (1,2,3), (2,3,4), or (3,4,5)\n\n- (1,2,3): then d > 2023, e > d, and a=b=c=2023, so a,b,c fixed, d and e > 2023, distinct.\n\nSum: 2023*3 + d + e = 10115 ⇒ d + e = 10115 - 6069 = 4046\n\nd and e integers, 2023 < d < e, so d ≥ 2024, e ≥ d+1, d + e = 4046\n\nSo e = 4046 - d > d ⇒ 4046 - d > d ⇒ 4046 > 2d ⇒ d < 2023\n\nBut d ≥ 2024, contradiction. So impossible.\n\n- (2,3,4): then a < 2023, e > 2023, b=c=d=2023\n\nSum: a + 2023*3 + e = 10115 ⇒ a + e = 10115 - 6069 = 4046\n\na < 2023, e > 2023, a and e integers, distinct from 2023 and each other.\n\nSo a ≤ 2022, e ≥ 2024, a + e = 4046\n\nSo e = 4046 - a ≥ 2024 ⇒ a ≤ 4046 - 2024 = 2022, ok.\n\na ≥ 1, e = 4046 - a ≤ ? no upper bound, but e > 2023, and a < 2023, so a from 1 to 2022, e = 4046 - a from 4045 down to 2024.\n\nAll these e are > 2023, and since a < 2023 < e, and a ≠ e (because a ≤ 2022, e ≥ 2024), so all good.\n\nNumber of solutions: a = 1 to 2022, but e = 4046 - a must be > 2023, i.e., a < 2023, which is true, and a ≥ 1, e = 4046 - a ≥ 2024 ⇒ a ≤ 2022, same.\n\nSo a = 1,2,...,2022 ⇒ 2022 solutions.\n\n- (3,4,5): then a ≤ b < 2023, c=d=e=2023\n\nSum: a + b + 2023*3 = 10115 ⇒ a + b = 4046\n\na ≤ b < 2023, a,b positive integers, distinct from 2023 and each other.\n\nSo a + b = 4046, a ≤ b < 2023\n\nThen b < 2023, a = 4046 - b > b? No, a ≤ b, so 4046 - b ≤ b ⇒ 4046 ≤ 2b ⇒ b ≥ 2023\n\nBut b < 2023, contradiction. So no solutions.\n\nSo for k=3, only (2,3,4) works, with 2022 solutions.\n\nFor k=4: positions (1,2,3,4) or (2,3,4,5)\n\n- (1,2,3,4): then e > 2023, a=b=c=d=2023\n\nSum: 2023*4 + e = 10115 ⇒ e = 10115 - 8092 = 2023, but e must be > 2023 and ≠ 2023, contradiction.\n\n- (2,3,4,5): then a < 2023, b=c=d=e=2023\n\nSum: a + 2023*4 = 10115 ⇒ a = 10115 - 8092 = 2023, but a < 2023, contradiction.\n\nSo k=4 impossible.\n\nk=5: all 2023, sum = 5*2023 = 10115, ok. But \"2023 appears more than once\" — yes, 5 times. \"No other integer appears more than once\" — vacuously true. So this is allowed.\n\nSo quintuple (2023,2023,2023,2023,2023) — one solution.\n\nNow summarize all cases:\n\n- k=2:\n  - (b,c) = (2023,2023): a < 2023, d > 2023, e > d, a + d + e = 6069\n  - (c,d) = (2023,2023): a < b < 2023, e > 2023, a + b + e = 6069\n\n- k=3: only (b,c,d) = (2023,2023,2023): a < 2023, e > 2023, a + e = 4046 → 2022 solutions\n\n- k=5: 1 solution\n\nk=4 impossible.\n\nNow let's compute k=2 cases carefully.\n\nFirst, (b,c) = (2023,2023): so a < 2023, d > 2023, e > d, all integers, a ≥ 1, d ≥ 2024, e ≥ d+1, and a + d + e = 6069\n\nFrom earlier, we had sum over a of floor((6068-a)/2) - 2023, and got 1,021,110\n\nBut let's verify with small numbers to see if method is sound.\n\nSuppose instead of 2023, use small number, say median = 3, mean = 3, so sum = 15, c=3.\n\nThen a≤b≤3≤d≤e, sum=15, 3 appears more than once, others distinct.\n\nThen a+b+3+d+e=15 ⇒ a+b+d+e=12\n\nc=3.\n\nk=2: (b,c)=(3,3) ⇒ a<3, d>3, e>d, a+d+e=9\n\na=1 or 2\n\nIf a=1: d+e=8, d≥4, e>d ⇒ d=4, e=4 not allowed (e>d), d=4,e=4 invalid; d=4,e=4 not >; d=4,e=4 not allowed; d=4,e=4 sum 8 but e not >d; d=3 not allowed (d>3); d=4,e=4 no; d=4,e=4 invalid; d=4,e=4 not >; minimum e=d+1=5, so d+e ≥ d+(d+1) = 2d+1 = 8 ⇒ 2d+1 ≤ 8 ⇒ d ≤ 3.5, d≤3, but d≥4, impossible.\n\na=2: d+e=7, d≥4, e≥d+1, so d=4,e=3 invalid; no.\n\nSo no solutions for small case? But let's list manually.\n\nPossible quintuples with median 3, mean 3, so sum 15, c=3.\n\nAnd 3 appears at least twice.\n\nTry (1,3,3,4,4) but 4 repeats, not allowed.\n\n(1,3,3,4,5): sum=16>15.\n\n(1,3,3,4,4) sum=15 but 4 repeats.\n\n(2,3,3,4,3) not sorted.\n\nSorted: a≤b≤c≤d≤e, c=3.\n\nSo possibilities with two 3s: positions (2,3) or (3,4)\n\n(2,3): a<3, d>3, e>d, sum a+3+3+d+e=15 ⇒ a+d+e=9\n\na=1: d+e=8, d≥4, e≥d+1 ⇒ d=4,e=4 not >; d=4,e=4 invalid; d=3 not allowed; no.\n\na=2: d+e=7, d≥4, e≥d+1 ⇒ d=4,e=3 invalid.\n\nSo no solutions for k=2 in small case.\n\nk=3: (b,c,d)=(3,3,3): a<3, e>3, a+e=15-9=6\n\na=1,e=5>3 ok; a=2,e=4>3 ok; a=3 not allowed. So (1,3,3,3,5), (2,3,3,3,4) — both valid? Check distinctness: in (1,3,3,3,5), 3 appears three times, others 1 and 5 appear once, ok. Sum=1+3+3+3+5=15, median=3, mean=3. Yes.\n\nSimilarly (2,3,3,3,4): sum=2+3+3+3+4=15, and 2,4,3 — 3 repeats, others unique. Ok.\n\nSo two solutions for k=3.\n\nk=5: (3,3,3,3,3) sum=15, ok.\n\nSo total N = 2 + 1 = 3 for small case.\n\nBack to original, perhaps only k=3 and k=5 contribute, and k=2 is impossible? But earlier for k=2 with (c,d), we had many solutions.\n\nIn small case with median 3, (c,d)=(3,3), then a<b<3, e>3, a+b+e=9\n\na and b <3, positive integers, a<b, so possibilities: a=1,b=2 only.\n\nThen e=9-1-2=6>3, ok. So (1,2,3,3,6) sum=15, median=3, 3 appears twice, others 1,2,6 unique. Yes! So one solution for (c,d) subcase.\n\nSo in small case, k=2 has 1 solution, k=3 has 2, k=5 has 1, total 4.\n\nLet's list all:\n\n- (1,2,3,3,6)\n- (1,3,3,3,5)\n- (2,3,3,3,4)\n- (3,3,3,3,3)\n\nYes, 4 solutions.\n\nSo our earlier calculation for large case should work.\n\nBut given time, and that the problem asks for e = N - 21464546/7, and likely this simplifies, perhaps the intended answer is an integer, and maybe N = 21464546/7 + integer.\n\n21464546 / 7 = 3,066,363.714285... = 3,066,363 + 5/7\n\nSo e = N - 3,066,363 - 5/7 = (N - 3,066,363) - 5/7\n\nFor e to be integer, N must be 3,066,363 + 5/7 + e, so N = (7*3,066,363 + 5 + 7e)/7 = (21,464,541 + 5 + 7e)/7 = (21,464,546 + 7e)/7, so N = 3,066,363 + e + 5/7, not integer unless e has fraction.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to compute N and then the expression, and it turns out to be a nice number.\n\nGiven the time, and that this is a contest-style problem, perhaps the answer is 0 or small number.\n\nMaybe I missed that \"lists\" means sequences, and \"2023 appears more than once\" means at least twice, and \"no other integer appears more than once\" means all other values are distinct and different from 2023.\n\nAnother thought: since a≤b≤c≤d≤e and c=2023, and only 2023 can repeat, the only possible repeats are at the center, so the block of 2023s must be contiguous and include c.\n\nSo the configuration is determined by how many 2023s, and how many numbers less than 2023 and greater than 2023.\n\nLet L = number of elements < 2023\nG = number of elements > 2023\nK = number of 2023s\nThen L + G + K = 5, K ≥ 2, L,G ≥ 0\n\nAnd since sorted, the L elements are first, then K copies of 2023, then G elements.\n\nSo a_1 ≤ ... ≤ a_L < 2023 = ... = 2023 < a_{L+K+1} ≤ ... ≤ a_5\n\nSo the tuple is determined by choosing L distinct positive integers < 2023, G distinct integers > 2023, and K = 5 - L - G ≥ 2\n\nAlso sum = sum of L numbers + 2023*K + sum of G numbers = 10115\n\nSo sum_L + sum_G = 10115 - 2023*K = 2023*(5 - K) = 2023*L + 2023*G? No.\n\n10115 = 5*2023, so sum_L + sum_G = 5*2023 - K*2023 = (5-K)*2023\n\nSo sum of the L smaller numbers plus sum of G larger numbers equals (5-K)*2023\n\nSince each smaller number ≤ 2022, and there are L of them, sum_L ≤ L*2022\n\nEach larger number ≥ 2024, sum_G ≥ G*2024\n\nSo sum_L + sum_G ≤ L*2022 + (some upper bound), but lower bound sum_L + sum_G ≥ 1+2+...+L + 2024+2025+...+(2024+G-1) = L(L+1)/2 + G*2024 + G(G-1)/2\n\nBut perhaps for feasibility, sum_L + sum_G = (5-K)*2023\n\nLet’s try possible (L,G,K):\n\nK=2 ⇒ L+G=3, sum_L + sum_G = 3*2023 = 6069\n\nL,G ≥ 0, L+G=3\n\nPossible (L,G): (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0)\n\n- (0,3): sum_G = 6069, G=3, numbers >2023, distinct, minimum sum = 2024+2025+2026 = 6075 > 6069, impossible\n\n- (1,2): sum_L + sum_G = 6069, L=1, G=2, so a < 2023, d<e, both >2023, a + d + e = 6069\n\nMin d+e = 2024+2025 = 4049, so a ≤ 6069-4049 = 2020, and a ≥ 1, and a < 2023, ok.\n\nNumber of solutions: for each a=1 to 2020, number of (d,e) with 2024 ≤ d < e, d+e = 6069-a\n\nFor fixed s = 6069-a, number of pairs d<e, d≥2024, e>s-d, but e = s-d > d ⇒ d < s/2, and d ≥ 2024, e = s-d ≥ d+1 ⇒ d ≤ (s-1)/2\n\nSo d from 2024 to floor((s-1)/2)\n\ns = 6069-a, a=1 to 2020, s=6068 down to 4049\n\nfloor((s-1)/2) = floor((6068-a-1)/2) = floor((6067-a)/2)\n\nSo d_max = floor((6067-a)/2), d_min = 2024\n\nCount = max(0, floor((6067-a)/2) - 2024 + 1) = floor((6067-a)/2) - 2023\n\nSame as before but with 6067 instead of 6068.\n\nEarlier we had 6069 - a - d > d ⇒ d < (6069-a)/2, so d ≤ floor((6069-a-1)/2) = floor((6068-a)/2)\n\nSo yes.\n\nThen sum over a=1 to 2020 of [floor((6068-a)/2) - 2023] = as before 1,021,110\n\n- (2,1): L=2, G=1, so a<b<2023, e>2023, a+b+e = 6069\n\na and b distinct <2023, e>2023\n\ne = 6069-a-b > 2023 ⇒ a+b < 4046\n\na<b≤2022, so a+b ≤ 2021+2022 = 4043 < 4046, so all pairs with a<b≤2022 are ok.\n\nNumber = \\binom{2022}{2} = 2022*2021/2 = as before 2,043,231\n\n- (3,0): sum_L = 6069, L=3, numbers <2023, distinct, max sum = 2020+2021+2022 = 6063 < 6069, impossible\n\nSo for K=2, total = 1,021,110 + 2,043,231 = 3,064,341\n\nK=3: L+G=2, sum_L + sum_G = 2*2023 = 4046\n\n(L,G) = (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\n\n- (0,2): sum_G = 4046, G=2, min sum = 2024+2025 = 4049 > 4046, impossible\n\n- (1,1): a < 2023, e > 2023, a + e = 4046\n\na ≥ 1, e = 4046-a > 2023 ⇒ a < 2023, and a ≤ 2022, e = 4046-a ≥ 2024 ⇒ a ≤ 2022, so a = 1 to 2022, e = 4045 down to 2024, all >2023, and a ≠ e since a ≤ 2022 < 2024 ≤ e, so 2022 solutions\n\n- (2,0): sum_L = 4046, L=2, a<b<2023, max sum = 2021+2022 = 4043 < 4046, impossible\n\nSo K=3 contributes 2022\n\nK=4: L+G=1, sum_L + sum_G = 1*2023 = 2023\n\n(L,G) = (0,1) or (1,0)\n\n- (0,1): e = 2023, but e > 2023 required, impossible\n\n- (1,0): a = 2023, but a < 2023 required, impossible\n\nSo K=4 impossible\n\nK=5: L=G=0, sum = 5*2023 = 10115, ok, 1 solution\n\nSo total N = 3,064,341 + 2022 + 1 = 3,066,364\n\nThen e = N - 21464546/7 = 3,066,364 - 3,066,363.714285... = 0.285714... = 2/7\n\nBecause 1 - 5/7 = 2/7\n\n3,066,364 = 3,066,363 + 1, so e = 1 - 5/7 = 2/7\n\nSo e = 2/7\n\nBut the problem says \"find e = (N - 21464546/7)\", and 21464546/7 = 3,066,363 + 5/7, so N = 3,066,364 = 3,066,363 + 1, so e = 1 - 5/7 = 2/7\n\nSo answer_1 = \"2/7\"\n\nBut usually answers are integers; however, the problem doesn't specify.\n\nPerhaps write as fraction.\n\nNow Problem 2:\n\nRad's garden: 30 red roses, 19 yellow roses, total 49 roses.\n\nLet x be number of yellow roses to remove.\n\nAfter removal, yellow roses = 19 - x, total roses = 49 - x\n\nWe want (19 - x) / (49 - x) = 2/7\n\nSolve:\n\n7(19 - x) = 2(49 - x)\n\n133 - 7x = 98 - 2x\n\n133 - 98 = 7x - 2x\n\n35 = 5x\n\nx = 7\n\nSo remove 7 yellow roses.\n\nCheck: yellow left = 12, total = 42, 12/42 = 2/7, yes.\n\nSo answer_2 = \"7\"\n\nNow for answer_1, e = 2/7, so \"2/7\"\n\nBut in JSON, should be string \"2/7\"\n\nOr perhaps decimal?
