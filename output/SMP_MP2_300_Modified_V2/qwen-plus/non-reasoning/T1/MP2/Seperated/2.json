Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\nWe are told:\n\nLet $ s(n) $ denote the number of 1's in the binary representation of $ n $ (i.e., the Hamming weight or population count).\n\nWe need to compute:\n\n$$\nk = T + 46, \\quad \\text{where } T = \\sum_{n=0}^{7} 2^n (-1)^{s(n)}\n$$\n\nSo we need to compute $ T $ for $ n = 0 $ to $ 7 $, i.e., 8 terms.\n\nLet’s list $ n $, its binary representation, $ s(n) $, $ (-1)^{s(n)} $, and $ 2^n (-1)^{s(n)} $:\n\n| n | binary | s(n) | (-1)^{s(n)} | 2^n | term = 2^n * (-1)^{s(n)} |\n|---|--------|------|-------------|-----|--------------------------|\n| 0 | 0      | 0    | (+1)        | 1   | +1                       |\n| 1 | 1      | 1    | -1          | 2   | -2                       |\n| 2 | 10     | 1    | -1          | 4   | -4                       |\n| 3 | 11     | 2    | +1          | 8   | +8                       |\n| 4 | 100    | 1    | -1          | 16  | -16                      |\n| 5 | 101    | 2    | +1          | 32  | +32                      |\n| 6 | 110    | 2    | +1          | 64  | +64                      |\n| 7 | 111    | 3    | -1          | 128 | -128                     |\n\nNow sum the terms:\n\n+1 −2 −4 +8 −16 +32 +64 −128\n\nGroup:\n\n(1 − 2) = −1  \n−1 − 4 = −5  \n−5 + 8 = 3  \n3 − 16 = −13  \n−13 + 32 = 19  \n19 + 64 = 83  \n83 − 128 = −45\n\nSo $ T = -45 $\n\nThen $ k = T + 46 = -45 + 46 = 1 $\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **1**\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\nWe have:\n\n- Store A sells:\n  - Headphones: 250 RMB\n  - Speakers: 600 RMB\n\n- Store B sells same items at same list prices.\n\n- Store B issues a coupon: “x RMB off 99 RMB”, meaning: if order total ≥ 99 RMB, get x RMB discount. Only one per order.\n\n- Also, Tmall’s “60 RMB off 299 RMB” coupon applies and can be stacked with yours.\n\nInterpretation of stacking: Since both are “off” coupons, and it says “can be stacked”, we assume they apply **additively**, i.e., total discount = x + 60, **provided both conditions are satisfied**.\n\nBut crucially: each coupon has its own minimum spend requirement:\n\n- Your coupon: order must be ≥ 99 RMB → then you get x RMB off.\n- Tmall coupon: order must be ≥ 299 RMB → then you get 60 RMB off.\n\nSo to use **both**, the order must satisfy **both thresholds**, i.e., total ≥ max(99, 299) = 299 RMB.\n\nSo for orders < 299 RMB, only your coupon applies (if ≥99), not Tmall’s.\n\nNow question has two parts:\n\n#### Part A:\n> What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend **at least 1 RMB less** on **either** the 250 RMB headphones **or** the 600 RMB speakers set in Store B than in Store A?\n\nThat is: For **one item alone**, can he get ≥1 RMB discount?\n\n- Headphones = 250 RMB.\n\nCheck if he can apply coupons:\n\n- 250 ≥ 99 → yes → your coupon applies → discount = x  \n- 250 < 299 → Tmall coupon does **not** apply.\n\nSo total discount on headphones = x  \nSo final price = 250 − x  \nTo be at least 1 RMB less than Store A’s 250 → need 250 − x ≤ 249 ⇒ x ≥ 1\n\nBut also x must be integer > 0 and < 99 → smallest such x is **1**\n\nBUT wait — is there any restriction preventing x = 1? The problem says “x is an integer greater than 0 and smaller than 99”. So x = 1 is allowed.\n\nHowever, let’s verify speakers:\n\n- Speakers = 600 RMB.\n\n600 ≥ 299 → both coupons apply → discount = x + 60  \nFinal price = 600 − x − 60 = 540 − x  \nTo be ≤ 599 ⇒ 540 − x ≤ 599 ⇒ always true since x > 0 ⇒ 540 − x < 540 < 599. So even x = 1 gives 539, which is 61 less.\n\nSo for either item alone, x = 1 suffices.\n\nBut hold on — is the “x RMB off 99 RMB” coupon applicable to a single item purchase? Yes, as long as total ≥ 99. Both 250 and 600 qualify.\n\nSo minimal x for part A is **1**\n\nBUT — wait! Read carefully:\n\n> “You plan to issue 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupons, limited to one per order”\n\nAnd:\n\n> “What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less on **either** the 250 RMB pair of the headphones **or** the 600 RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?”\n\nSo yes — for headphones alone: pay 250 − x, need 250 − x ≤ 249 ⇒ x ≥ 1.\n\nSo answer for first subpart is **1**\n\n#### Part B:\n\n> What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less for buying **both** the 250 RMB headphones and the 600 RMB speakers set in Store B than in Store A?\n\nSo combined purchase: 250 + 600 = 850 RMB.\n\nIn Store A: pays 850.\n\nIn Store B: can apply both coupons? Let's check thresholds:\n\n- 850 ≥ 99 → your coupon applies → x off  \n- 850 ≥ 299 → Tmall coupon applies → 60 off  \nSo total discount = x + 60  \nFinal price = 850 − x − 60 = 790 − x\n\nWe want:\n\n790 − x ≤ 849 ⇒ x ≥ 850 − 790 = 60? Wait no:\n\nWait: “at least 1 RMB less” means final price ≤ 850 − 1 = 849.\n\nSo:\n\n790 − x ≤ 849  \n→ −x ≤ 849 − 790 = 59  \n→ x ≥ −59 → always true? That can’t be right.\n\nHold on — miscalculation.\n\n850 − (x + 60) = 790 − x? No:\n\n850 − x − 60 = 790 − x → yes.\n\nSet 790 − x ≤ 849  \n→ −x ≤ 59  \n→ x ≥ −59 → always true for positive x.\n\nBut that suggests even x = 1 gives 790 − 1 = 789, which is 61 less — way more than 1.\n\nSo why ask for minimal x? Something is off.\n\nWait — maybe stacking is **not additive**, or there’s a subtlety.\n\nLet’s re-read coupon wording:\n\n- Your coupon: “x RMB off 99 RMB” — standard interpretation: “Get x RMB discount when spending at least 99 RMB”.\n\n- Tmall coupon: “60 RMB off 299 RMB” — same.\n\nBut can they be stacked? The problem says: “can be applied … and can be stacked”.\n\nIn real e-commerce, “stacking” usually means both discounts apply, but sometimes platform rules limit stacking of similar coupons. However, problem explicitly says they *can* be stacked.\n\nSo yes, total discount = x + 60.\n\nThen for combined purchase: 850 − x − 60 = 790 − x.\n\nWe want 790 − x ≤ 849 → x ≥ −59 → always true.\n\nSo minimal x is still 1.\n\nBut that seems too trivial — perhaps misinterpretation.\n\nAlternative interpretation: “x RMB off 99 RMB” means “x RMB discount *on orders of exactly 99 RMB*”? No, that’s not standard. Standard is “minimum spend 99, get x off”.\n\nAnother possibility: “x RMB off 99 RMB” means “x% off”? But no — it says “x RMB off 99 RMB”, like “20 RMB off 99 RMB”, a common Tmall format meaning: if order ≥ 99, get 20 off.\n\nYes, that’s correct.\n\nBut then why would part B require larger x? Let's double-check Store A pricing.\n\nStore A sells same items at same list prices — so Store A charges 250 and 600 individually, and 850 together.\n\nBut perhaps in Store A, Xiao Ming could also use Tmall’s 60-off-299 coupon? The problem doesn’t say Store A offers your coupon, but Tmall’s coupon is platform-wide, so it applies to Store A too!\n\nAh! Critical point!\n\nThe problem says:\n\n> The Tmall.com '60 RMB off 299 RMB' coupon can be applied to purchases at store B and can be stacked with your 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupon.\n\nIt does **not** say it’s unavailable at Store A. In fact, since it’s a platform coupon, it likely applies to Store A as well.\n\nSo to compare fairly, we must consider what Xiao Ming can spend in Store A *with available coupons*, and in Store B *with available coupons*, and find x such that Store B price ≤ Store A price − 1.\n\nThat makes sense! Otherwise, part B is trivial.\n\nSo let’s reinterpret:\n\n- In Store A: Xiao Ming can use Tmall’s 60-off-299 coupon (since it’s platform-wide), but **not** your x-off-99 coupon (since Store A doesn’t issue it).\n\n- In Store B: He can use **both**: your x-off-99 and Tmall’s 60-off-299, *if eligible*.\n\nSo we need to compute max possible discount in each store.\n\n#### For a single item:\n\n- Headphones = 250 RMB.\n\nIn Store A: 250 ≥ 299? No → cannot use Tmall coupon → pays 250.\n\nIn Store B: 250 ≥ 99 → can use your coupon → pays 250 − x. (Tmall coupon not applicable since 250 < 299.)\n\nSo to have 250 − x ≤ 249 ⇒ x ≥ 1.\n\nSame as before.\n\n- Speakers = 600 RMB.\n\nIn Store A: 600 ≥ 299 → can use Tmall coupon → pays 600 − 60 = 540.\n\nIn Store B: 600 ≥ 299 → can use both → pays 600 − x − 60 = 540 − x.\n\nSo Store B saves extra x vs Store A.\n\nTo save ≥1: need 540 − x ≤ 539 ⇒ x ≥ 1.\n\nStill x = 1.\n\n#### For combined purchase: 250 + 600 = 850.\n\nIn Store A: 850 ≥ 299 → can use Tmall coupon → pays 850 − 60 = 790.\n\nIn Store B: 850 ≥ 299 and ≥ 99 → can use both → pays 850 − x − 60 = 790 − x.\n\nSo Store B price = Store A price − x.\n\nTo have Store B price ≤ Store A price − 1 ⇒ x ≥ 1.\n\nAgain, x = 1.\n\nBut the problem asks: “What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less …” — and for combined, difference is exactly x, so x = 1 suffices.\n\nSo both parts give x = 1?\n\nBut maybe there's a catch with coupon application rules.\n\nLet’s read again: “x RMB off 99 RMB” — is it possible that this coupon is *only* valid on orders where the amount *before discount* is ≥ 99, but the discount is capped or conditional?\n\nNo, standard is flat discount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe “x RMB off 99 RMB” means “you pay 99 − x for orders of value 99”, i.e., it's a fixed-price deal? But that contradicts “x RMB off”, and “limited to one per order” suggests discount.\n\nAlso example: “discount for an order of 250 RMB is x RMB, not 2x” — confirms it's a flat discount x, not percentage.\n\nSo all consistent.\n\nThus minimal x is 1 for both.\n\nBut the problem phrases them as two separate questions — maybe expecting two answers? Let's see exact wording:\n\n> What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less on either the 250 RMB pair of the headphones or the 600 RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?  \n> What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less for buying both the 250 RMB pair of the headphones and the 600 RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?\n\nSo two questions → two answers.\n\nBoth are 1.\n\nBut maybe for “either”, we need x such that **at least one** of the two items gives ≥1 RMB saving — which x = 1 does (both do).\n\nSo answer to first is 1, second is 1.\n\nBut let’s test edge case: is x = 1 allowed? Yes: “x is an integer greater than 0 and smaller than 99”.\n\nSo x = 1 is valid.\n\nHence both answers are 1.\n\nBut wait — maybe for the headphones alone in Store B, can he use Tmall coupon? 250 < 299 → no.\n\nSo discount = x only.\n\nIn Store A, no x-coupon, and no Tmall coupon → pays 250.\n\nSo yes, x = 1 gives 249.\n\nAll good.\n\nThus final answers:\n\n- Problem 1: 1  \n- Problem 2, part 1: 1  \n- Problem 2, part 2: 1  \n\nBut the JSON format only has `\"answer_1\"` and `\"answer_2\"`. Looking back at the instruction:\n\n> \"answer_1\": \"your answer to Problem 1\"  \n> \"answer_2\": \"your answer to Problem 2\"\n\nBut Problem 2 has two questions. How to output?\n\nRe-read problem statement:\n\n> Problem 2: You plan to open... What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less on either [...]? What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less for buying both [...]?\n\nSo Problem 2 has **two questions**, both asking for a minimal x.\n\nBut the JSON only has `\"answer_2\"` — singular.\n\nPossibility: They expect a single answer — but that doesn’t make sense.\n\nOr maybe `\"answer_2\"` should contain both values, e.g., as a list or pair.\n\nBut instruction says: “For numerical answers, provide the exact value” and “Put ONLY the answer value in the quotes”.\n\nAnd example shows `\"answer_2\": \"Monday\"` — a string.\n\nLooking at formatting rules: “no units unless part of the answer”, “no explanations”.\n\nPossibility: They expect two numbers separated by comma? Or as a tuple?\n\nBut JSON value must be a string or number. Since it's two numbers, safest is to output as a string like \"1,1\".\n\nBut let’s see if problem expects something else.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe for “either”, we need x such that **for at least one** of the items, he saves ≥1, which is x=1.\n\nFor “both items together”, also x=1.\n\nSo both are 1.\n\nThus `\"answer_2\": \"1,1\"` or `\"answer_2\": \"1\"`? But problem clearly asks two questions.\n\nGiven the JSON has only `\"answer_2\"`, and no `\"answer_3\"`, likely they expect `\"answer_2\"` to be the answer to the *second* question of Problem 2? No — the instruction says `\"answer_2\": \"your answer to Problem 2\"`.\n\nBut Problem 2 contains two questions. This is ambiguous.\n\nLet me check original problem statement again:\n\n> Problem 2: You plan to open... What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less on either [...] ? What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less for buying both [...] ?\n\nSo it's one problem with two subquestions. In many contests, such problems expect both answers, often as an ordered pair.\n\nSince JSON only allows one `\"answer_2\"`, and no further fields, likely expected format is `\"answer_2\": \"1 1\"` or `\"1,1\"`.\n\nBut instruction says “no additional text”, and “exact value”.\n\nLooking at similar problems, sometimes they expect the two answers concatenated.\n\nTo resolve, note that the first subquestion is about “either”, second about “both”.\n\nAnd both evaluate to 1.\n\nSo safest is `\"answer_2\": \"1,1\"`\n\nBut let’s see if there's any reason x must be larger.\n\nWait — reconsider coupon stacking rule.\n\nIs it possible that “stacking” means the second coupon applies to the amount *after* the first discount? But problem says “x RMB off 99 RMB” and “60 RMB off 299 RMB” — both are absolute discounts, and stacking usually means both subtracted from total.\n\nMoreover, example says “discount for an order of 250 RMB is x RMB, not 2x” — confirms flat.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother angle: Minimum spend for your coupon is 99, but after Tmall discount? No — minimum spend is pre-discount.\n\nStandard is pre-discount total.\n\nSo 850 qualifies for both.\n\nThus x = 1 works.\n\nHence answers:\n\n- answer_1 = 1  \n- answer_2 = ? Since two questions, and only one field, likely they want both numbers. I'll go with `\"1,1\"`\n\nBut let’s confirm with a sanity check: if x = 1,\n\n- Headphones only: Store A = 250, Store B = 250 − 1 = 249 → saves 1 ✔  \n- Speakers only: Store A = 600 − 60 = 540, Store B = 600 − 1 − 60 = 539 → saves 1 ✔  \n- Both: Store A = 850 − 60 = 790, Store B = 850 − 1 − 60 = 789 → saves 1 ✔\n\nAll satisfied.\n\nSo minimal x is 1 for all.\n\nThus `\"answer_2\": \"1,1\"`\n\nBut maybe the problem expects just the second x? No — it says “What is the minimal number x such that … ? What is the minimal number x such that … ?” — two x’s.\n\nGiven constraints, `\"answer_2\": \"1,1\"` is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the answer to the *last* question only? But instruction says “your answer to Problem 2”, and Problem 2 contains both.\n\nI think `\"1,1\"` is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers:\n\n- answer_1 = 1  \n- answer_2 = \"1,1\"\n\nNow write reasoning concisely.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Compute T = sum_{n=0}^7 2^n (-1)^{s(n)}. Listing n from 0 to 7, their binary forms, s(n), and terms: n=0: +1; n=1: -2; n=2: -4; n=3: +8; n=4: -16; n=5: +32; n=6: +64; n=7: -128. Summing gives T = -45. Then k = T + 46 = 1. Problem 2: For a single item, Store A has no x-coupon; for headphones (250), Store A charges 250 (since 250 < 299, no Tmall coupon), Store B charges 250 - x, so x >= 1. For speakers (600), Store A charges 600 - 60 = 540, Store B charges 600 - x - 60 = 540 - x, so x >= 1. For both items (850), Store A charges 850 - 60 = 790, Store B charges 850 - x - 60 = 790 - x, so x >= 1.
