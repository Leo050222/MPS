  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 1**\n\nPablo assembles a $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ cube from 27 unit cubes:  \n- 10 red  \n- 9 blue  \n- 8 yellow  \n\nWe are to **minimize the total surface area of the large cube that is red**, i.e., minimize the total number of red unit-square faces visible on the exterior of the large cube.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\n> Instead of determining the minimal total exposed face area contributed by the red small cubes on the surface of the assembled large cube, simply find $d = n + 20$, where $n$ is the number of red small cubes placed in positions exposing **three faces** in the assembly that achieves this minimum.\n\nSo we need to:\n- Find the arrangement of red cubes (among the 27 positions) that minimizes total red-exposed surface area.\n- Among such optimal arrangements, determine how many red cubes are placed in **corner positions**, since only corners expose **three faces** (edges expose two, faces expose one, interior exposes zero).\n- Then compute $d = n + 20$, where $n$ = number of red cubes in corner positions.\n\nSo first, understand the position types in a $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ cube:\n\n- **Corners**: 8 positions — each has 3 faces exposed.\n- **Edges (but not corners)**: Each edge of a cube has 3 cubes; subtracting 2 corners leaves 1 middle cube per edge. A cube has 12 edges → 12 edge-center positions, each with **2 faces exposed**.\n- **Face centers (not on edge)**: Each face has a center cube (the one not on any edge). There are 6 faces → 6 face-center positions, each with **1 face exposed**.\n- **Interior**: The very center cube — 1 position, with **0 faces exposed**.\n\nLet’s verify count:  \n8 corners + 12 edges + 6 face-centers + 1 interior = 27 ✔️\n\nSo exposure counts per position type:\n\n| Type         | Count | Exposed faces per cube |\n|--------------|--------|-------------------------|\n| Corner       | 8      | 3                       |\n| Edge (mid)   | 12     | 2                       |\n| Face center  | 6      | 1                       |\n| Interior     | 1      | 0                       |\n\nTo minimize total red-exposed surface area, we want red cubes to occupy positions with **as few exposed faces as possible**, i.e., prefer interior → face centers → edges → corners.\n\nBut we have 10 red cubes to place.\n\nAvailable positions by exposure:\n\n- Interior: 1 position → 0 exposure  \n- Face centers: 6 positions → 1 exposure each  \n- Edges: 12 positions → 2 exposure each  \n- Corners: 8 positions → 3 exposure each  \n\nSo best strategy: fill lowest-exposure positions first.\n\nWe have 10 red cubes.\n\n- Use interior: 1 cube → 0 exposure  \n- Use face centers: up to 6 → now used 7 cubes  \n- Still need 3 more red cubes → next best is edges (2 exposure each), so use 3 edge positions.\n\nSo optimal placement uses:\n\n- 1 interior  \n- 6 face centers  \n- 3 edge centers  \n- 0 corners  \n\nThat gives total exposed red area =  \n$1 \\cdot 0 + 6 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 2 + 0 \\cdot 3 = 0 + 6 + 6 = 12$\n\nIs that minimal? Yes — any red cube placed in a corner would add 3 instead of at most 2 (if we instead used an edge instead of corner), so we avoid corners entirely.\n\nBut wait — can we do better than 12? Let's see if using more face centers or edges helps — but we already used all 6 face centers and the only lower than edge is interior (only 1). So yes, 12 is minimal.\n\nThus, in the optimal arrangement, **no red cube is placed in a corner**, so $n = 0$.\n\nTherefore, $d = n + 20 = 0 + 20 = 20$\n\nBUT — hold on! Is it *possible* to place 10 red cubes without using any corner? Let's check availability:\n\n- Interior: 1  \n- Face centers: 6  \n- Edges: 12  \n\nSo 1 + 6 + 12 = 19 positions with exposure ≤ 2. We only need 10 → definitely possible. So yes, $n = 0$ is achievable.\n\nHence answer to Problem 1 is **20**.\n\nWait — but let me double-check: Are there any constraints I missed? For example, do we have to use exactly 10 red, 9 blue, 8 yellow — but no restriction on arrangement other than total counts. So yes, we can freely assign colors to positions to minimize red exposure.\n\nSo $n = 0$, $d = 20$\n\n✅\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2**\n\nWhat is the **tens digit** of the **smallest positive integer divisible by each of 20, 16, and 2016**?\n\nThat is, find $\\text{LCM}(20, 16, 2016)$, then find its tens digit (i.e., the second digit from the right).\n\nStep 1: Prime factorizations.\n\n- $20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5$  \n- $16 = 2^4$  \n- $2016 = ?$\n\nFactor 2016:\n\n2016 ÷ 2 = 1008  \n1008 ÷ 2 = 504  \n504 ÷ 2 = 252  \n252 ÷ 2 = 126  \n126 ÷ 2 = 63 → that's five 2s: $2^5$  \n63 = $7 \\cdot 9 = 7 \\cdot 3^2$\n\nSo $2016 = 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7$\n\nNow collect max exponents across all three numbers:\n\n- $2$: max exponent among $2^2$, $2^4$, $2^5$ → $2^5$  \n- $3$: only in 2016 → $3^2$  \n- $5$: only in 20 → $5^1$  \n- $7$: only in 2016 → $7^1$\n\nSo LCM = $2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n- $2^5 = 32$  \n- $3^2 = 9$  \n- So $32 \\cdot 9 = 288$  \n- $288 \\cdot 5 = 1440$  \n- $1440 \\cdot 7 = ?$\n\n$1440 \\cdot 7 = 1440 \\cdot (5 + 2) = 7200 + 2880 = 10080$\n\nOr directly:  \n$1440 \\times 7$:  \n$1000×7 = 7000$  \n$400×7 = 2800$  \n$40×7 = 280$  \nTotal = $7000 + 2800 = 9800 + 280 = 10080$\n\nSo LCM = **10080**\n\nNow, what is the **tens digit**? That is the digit in the 10s place.\n\n10080 → digits: 1 0 0 8 0  \nFrom right: units = 0, tens = 8, hundreds = 0, thousands = 0, ten-thousands = 1\n\nSo tens digit is **8**\n\n✅\n\n---\n\n### Final Answers\n\n- Problem 1: $d = 20$  \n- Problem 2: tens digit = 8\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To minimize red surface area on the 3×3×3 cube, place red cubes in positions with fewest exposed faces: 1 interior (0 faces), 6 face-centers (1 face each), and 3 edge-centers (2 faces each), totaling 10 red cubes. This uses no corner positions (which expose 3 faces), so n = 0. Thus d = n + 20 = 20. Problem 2: Compute LCM(20, 16, 2016). Prime factorizations: 20 = 2²·5, 16 = 2⁴, 2016 = 2⁵·3²·7. LCM takes max exponents: 2⁵·3²·5·7 = 32·9·5·7 = 288·5 = 1440, 1440·7 = 10080. The tens digit of 10080 is 8.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"20\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"8\"\n}",
