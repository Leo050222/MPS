To raise this average to 22 points, how many points must Jackie score in her next game? Instead of determining the score required in the subsequent game to achieve the next targeted average, simply find $e = (total_after - 333)$, where $total_after$ is the cumulative points scored upon attaining the intermediate average following the recent game."

  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:\n\nJackie scored 36 points in her last game, and that raised her average from 20 to 21.\n\nLet’s find how many games she had played *before* that game.\n\nLet $ n $ be the number of games before the recent game.\n\nThen total points before the recent game = $ 20n $.\n\nAfter scoring 36 points in the next game (game # $ n+1 $), her new average is 21, over $ n+1 $ games:\n\n$$\n\\frac{20n + 36}{n + 1} = 21\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by $ n + 1 $:\n\n$$\n20n + 36 = 21(n + 1) = 21n + 21\n$$\n\nBring terms together:\n\n$$\n20n + 36 = 21n + 21 \\\\\n36 - 21 = 21n - 20n \\\\\n15 = n\n$$\n\nSo she had played 15 games before the recent one → total games after the recent game = 16.\n\nTotal points after the recent game = $ 20 \\cdot 15 + 36 = 300 + 36 = 336 $.\n\nCheck: average = $ 336 / 16 = 21 $ ✔️\n\nNow, the problem says:\n\n> Instead of determining the score required in the subsequent game to achieve the next targeted average, simply find $ e = (\\text{total\\_after} - 333) $, where $ \\text{total\\_after} $ is the cumulative points scored upon attaining the intermediate average following the recent game.\n\n\"Intermediate average following the recent game\" — that is the average of 21, achieved *after* the recent game. So \"total_after\" is the total points after that recent game, i.e., 336.\n\nThus:\n\n$$\ne = 336 - 333 = 3\n$$\n\nAnswer 1 is 3.\n\nProblem 2:\n\nLauren makes 10 baskets, each worth 2 or 3 points. Total points = 26.\n\nLet $ x $ = number of 3-point baskets.\n\nThen number of 2-point baskets = $ 10 - x $.\n\nTotal points:\n\n$$\n3x + 2(10 - x) = 26 \\\\\n3x + 20 - 2x = 26 \\\\\nx + 20 = 26 \\\\\nx = 6\n$$\n\nSo she made 6 three-point baskets.\n\nAnswer 2 is 6.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let n be games before the recent game. Then 20n + 36 = 21(n + 1) → 20n + 36 = 21n + 21 → n = 15. So total games after recent game = 16, total points = 20*15 + 36 = 336. Then e = 336 - 333 = 3. Problem 2: Let x be number of 3-point baskets. Then 3x + 2(10 - x) = 26 → x + 20 = 26 → x = 6.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
