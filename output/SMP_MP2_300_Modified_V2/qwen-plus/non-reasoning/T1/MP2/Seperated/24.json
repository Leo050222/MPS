On the third day, they eat $\frac{3}{4}$ of the remaining candies. On the fourth day, they eat $\frac{4}{5}$ of the remaining candies.

However, when tiles are added to form figures, they may share sides, reducing total perimeter.\n\nThe problem says: “Each figure after the first is formed by adding 1 tile to the previous figure.” So it's a sequence where figure $ n $ has $ n $ tiles.\n\nWe need to find $ n $ such that the perimeter of the figure made of $ n $ equilateral triangle tiles (each side 7 cm) is 91 cm.\n\nBut how does perimeter change as we add tiles?\n\nThis depends on *how* tiles are attached. Since no diagram is given, we must infer the standard pattern for such problems.\n\nCommon patterns:\n\n- If triangles are arranged in a straight \"strip\" (like a row), sharing one side each time, then:\n    - 1 triangle: 3 sides → perimeter = 3×7 = 21\n    - Add second triangle sharing one side → new perimeter adds 2 sides (since one side is internal), subtracts 2×7 (the shared side is removed from both perimeters) → net change: +2×7 − 2×7? Wait, better to compute directly.\n\nStandard approach:\n\n- Each triangle contributes 3 edges of length 7.\n- When two triangles share a side, that side becomes internal → subtract 2×7 from total perimeter (since it was counted once in each triangle’s perimeter, now not part of outer perimeter).\n\nSo total perimeter = (3n × 7) − 2 × 7 × (number of shared sides)\n\nLet $ s $ = number of shared sides (i.e., interior edges between two tiles).\n\nThen perimeter $ P = 21n - 14s $\n\nWe are told $ P = 91 $. So:\n\n$$\n21n - 14s = 91\n$$\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\n$$\n3n - 2s = 13 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n$$\n\nAlso, for planar arrangements of triangles, maximum number of shared sides is limited. But more importantly, the problem likely assumes a *linear chain*: each new triangle shares exactly one side with the previous figure.\n\nLet’s test that.\n\n- Figure 1 (n=1): 1 triangle → s = 0 → P = 21\n- Figure 2 (n=2): attach second triangle sharing one side → s = 1 → P = 21×2 − 14×1 = 42 − 14 = 28\n- Figure 3: add third triangle sharing one side with the figure → but depending on attachment, could share 1 side → s = 2 → P = 63 − 28 = 35\n\nSo pattern: each new tile adds 7 cm to perimeter? Let's list:\n\nn | P  \n1 | 21  \n2 | 28  \n3 | 35  \n4 | 42  \n... seems like P = 7(2n + 1)? Wait: 21 = 7×3, 28 = 7×4, 35 = 7×5, 42 = 7×6 → so P = 7(n + 2)? Check: n=1 → 7×3 = 21 ✔, n=2 → 7×4 = 28 ✔, n=3 → 7×5 = 35 ✔.\n\nSo P = 7(n + 2)\n\nThen set equal to 91:\n\n7(n + 2) = 91 ⇒ n + 2 = 13 ⇒ n = 11\n\nCheck: n = 11 → P = 7×13 = 91 ✔\n\nBut why is P = 7(n + 2)? Let's verify logic.\n\nIn a linear chain of equilateral triangles (like a “snake”), each triangle after the first shares one side with the previous, so adds 2 new external sides (since it has 3 sides, one is shared → 2 exposed). First triangle has 3 exposed sides.\n\nSo:\n\n- n = 1: 3 sides → 21 cm  \n- n = 2: 3 + 2 = 5 sides → 35 cm? Wait no — earlier we said 28. Contradiction.\n\nWait, let's draw mentally:\n\nOne equilateral triangle: 3 sides → perimeter 21.\n\nAdd second triangle sharing a full side: now shape is a rhombus-like shape (two triangles back-to-back), i.e., a diamond (a rhombus made of two equilateral triangles) — actually, it's a rhombus with angles 60° and 120°, with 4 outer sides → perimeter = 4×7 = 28. Yes! So 4 sides.\n\nThat matches: 28.\n\nAdd third triangle: where? To maintain minimal perimeter growth, usually attached to an outer side — but to keep linear chain, attach to one end: then new triangle shares one side, adds two new sides, but one side of previous end becomes internal? Let's count edges.\n\nBetter: use graph / edge counting.\n\nEach triangle has 3 edges.\n\nTotal edges counted with multiplicity: 3n.\n\nEach shared edge is counted twice in that sum, but appears 0 times in perimeter.\n\nSo perimeter in terms of number of unit edges (each 7 cm) is:\n\nLet $ e $ = number of distinct outer edges (i.e., edges on boundary). Then perimeter = $ 7e $.\n\nWe have: total edge incidences = 3n = 2s + e, because each shared edge is in 2 triangles → contributes 2 to count, each outer edge is in 1 triangle → contributes 1.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n3n = 2s + e \\Rightarrow e = 3n - 2s\n$$\n\nThus perimeter $ P = 7e = 7(3n - 2s) = 21n - 14s $ — same as before.\n\nNow, what is maximum possible $ s $ for n triangles? In a tree-like arrangement (no cycles), max $ s = n - 1 $, since each shared edge connects two tiles, and to connect n tiles, need at least n−1 adjacencies (like a tree). If cycles exist, s can be larger.\n\nBut minimal perimeter occurs when s is maximal.\n\nHowever, problem doesn’t specify arrangement — but says “a sequence of figures is formed using tiles. Each figure after the first is formed by adding 1 tile to the previous figure.” This suggests a specific, consistent way — likely the most natural: each new tile is attached along one full side to the existing figure, and no two tiles overlap.\n\nIn such case, the *minimum* number of shared sides is n−1 (tree), and maximum depends on geometry.\n\nBut perimeter is given as 91, which is fairly large — suggests relatively few shared sides.\n\nTry assuming s = n − 1 (linear chain/tree):\n\nThen $ e = 3n - 2(n - 1) = 3n - 2n + 2 = n + 2 $\n\nSo $ e = n + 2 $, thus $ P = 7(n + 2) $, as before.\n\nSet $ 7(n + 2) = 91 \\Rightarrow n + 2 = 13 \\Rightarrow n = 11 $\n\nThat gives e = 13 outer edges → perimeter 91 cm.\n\nIs this valid? For n = 11, s = 10 shared sides → possible? Yes — e.g., a straight chain of 11 triangles, each sharing one side with next → like a zigzag strip. In such a strip of equilateral triangles (alternating up/down), the shape has perimeter growing linearly.\n\nIndeed, standard result: for a polyiamond (triangular polyform) that is a \"straight\" path of n triangles (a “tribone” or “triangle snake”), the perimeter is $ 2n + 4 $ in terms of triangle sides? Wait, let's verify small n:\n\nn = 1: e = 3 → P = 21  \nn = 2: diamond → 4 sides → e = 4  \nn = 3: attach third triangle to end → now shape has 5 outer sides? Let's think.\n\nTwo triangles (diamond): vertices A,B,C,D — sides AB, BC, CD, DA — all length 7.\n\nAdd third triangle sharing side, say, CD → new triangle CDE. Now outer edges: AB, BC, CE, ED, DA? Wait, CD was outer, now becomes internal. So remove CD, add CE and ED → net +1 edge. So e goes from 4 to 5.\n\nSo n=1: e=3  \nn=2: e=4  \nn=3: e=5  \n→ e = n + 2 ✔\n\nYes! So e = n + 2.\n\nThus perimeter = 7(n + 2)\n\nSo for P = 91 ⇒ n + 2 = 13 ⇒ n = 11\n\nTherefore, answer_2 = 11\n\n✅\n\n---\n\nFinal answers:\n\nanswer_1 = 91  \nanswer_2 = 11\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let initial candies be x.
