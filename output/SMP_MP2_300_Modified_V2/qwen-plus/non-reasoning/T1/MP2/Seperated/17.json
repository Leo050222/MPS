We only need $ k = v - 1 $, and since $ v = 3x = 6 $, then $ k = 5 $.\n\nProblem 2:  \nThe original line is $ y = 3x + 5 $. Translating a graph **2 units to the right** means replacing $ x $ with $ x - 2 $ in the equation (since shifting right by $ a $ units replaces $ x $ with $ x - a $).  \nSo substitute:  \n$ y = 3(x - 2) + 5 = 3x - 6 + 5 = 3x - 1 $.  \nThus, the resulting equation is $ y = 3x - 1 $.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Given x = 2, v = 3x = 6.
