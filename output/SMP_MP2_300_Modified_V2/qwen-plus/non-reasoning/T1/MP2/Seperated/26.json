      "A3130": "Storage space on a computer is measured in gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB), where $1 \\mathrm{~GB} = 1024 \\mathrm{MB}$. Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes."

  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:  \nWe are told Julia has a 300 GB hard drive. Since 1 GB = 1024 MB, the total capacity C in MB is:  \nC = 300 × 1024 = 307200 MB.  \n\nWe are asked to compute d = C − 307100.  \nSo d = 307200 − 307100 = 100.  \n\nNote: The problem says “Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find d = C − 307100”, and C is the total capacity in MB. So we do exactly that — no need to consider the 300000 MB data for d; it's just a red herring for this specific computation.\n\nProblem 2:  \nRegular prices:  \n- Bicycle: $320  \n- Helmet: $80  \nTotal regular price = 320 + 80 = $400  \n\nSale discounts:  \n- Bicycle: 20% off → saves 0.20 × 320 = $64 → sale price = 320 − 64 = $256  \n- Helmet: 10% off → saves 0.10 × 80 = $8 → sale price = 80 − 8 = $72  \n\nTotal sale price = 256 + 72 = $328  \n\nTotal savings = 400 − 328 = $72  \n\nPercentage savings on total purchase = (savings / original total) × 100 = (72 / 400) × 100 = 0.18 × 100 = 18%  \n\nSo answer is 18.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Convert 300 GB to MB: 300 × 1024 = 307200 MB.
