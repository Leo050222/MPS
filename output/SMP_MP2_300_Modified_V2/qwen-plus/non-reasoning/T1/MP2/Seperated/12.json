Step 2: If $m$ is even, Alicia sets $n=\frac{1}{2} m$. If $m$ is odd, Alicia sets $n=m+1$. Step 3: Alicia writes down the number $m+n+1$ as the next term. Step 4: Alicia sets $m$ equal to the value of the term that she just wrote down in Step 3. Step 5: Alicia repeats Steps 2, 3, 4 until she has five terms, at which point she stops. Instead of determining the fifth term generated by the iterative algorithm, simply find $k$ equal to the fifth term minus 30."

  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems. Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 1:**\n\nAlicia starts with $ m = 3 $. She generates a sequence of five terms using the following algorithm:\n\n- Step 1: Write down $ m $ as the first term.\n- Step 2: If $ m $ is even, set $ n = \\frac{1}{2}m $; if $ m $ is odd, set $ n = m + 1 $.\n- Step 3: Write down $ m + n + 1 $ as the next term.\n- Step 4: Set $ m $ equal to that new term (i.e., update $ m $ to be the term just written).\n- Step 5: Repeat Steps 2–4 until five terms are written.\n\nWe need the **fifth term**, then compute $ k = \\text{fifth term} - 30 $.\n\nLet’s generate the terms one by one.\n\n---\n\n**Term 1:**  \nStart with $ m = 3 $. So first term is $ 3 $.\n\nNow update for next term:\n\n- $ m = 3 $ (odd) → $ n = m + 1 = 4 $\n- Next term = $ m + n + 1 = 3 + 4 + 1 = 8 $\n\nSo **Term 2 = 8**, and now set $ m = 8 $.\n\n---\n\n**Term 2 = 8**, so now $ m = 8 $ (even):\n\n- $ n = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 = 4 $\n- Next term = $ m + n + 1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 $\n\nSo **Term 3 = 13**, set $ m = 13 $.\n\n---\n\n**Term 3 = 13**, $ m = 13 $ (odd):\n\n- $ n = 13 + 1 = 14 $\n- Next term = $ 13 + 14 + 1 = 28 $\n\nSo **Term 4 = 28**, set $ m = 28 $.\n\n---\n\n**Term 4 = 28**, $ m = 28 $ (even):\n\n- $ n = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 28 = 14 $\n- Next term = $ 28 + 14 + 1 = 43 $\n\nSo **Term 5 = 43**\n\nThus, $ k = 43 - 30 = 13 $\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **13**\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\nEvaluate $ \\sqrt{13 + \\sqrt{7 + \\sqrt{4}}} $\n\nStart from innermost:\n\n- $ \\sqrt{4} = 2 $\n- Then $ 7 + \\sqrt{4} = 7 + 2 = 9 $, so $ \\sqrt{7 + \\sqrt{4}} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 $\n- Then $ 13 + \\sqrt{7 + \\sqrt{4}} = 13 + 3 = 16 $, so $ \\sqrt{13 + \\sqrt{7 + \\sqrt{4}}} = \\sqrt{16} = 4 $\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 2 is **4**\n\n---\n\nNow format final answer in required JSON.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Starting with m=3, Term 1 = 3.
