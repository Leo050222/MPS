  "reasoning_content": "We are given two problems to solve.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 1**:  \nIf $ x $ and $ y $ are positive integers with $ x + y = 31 $, what is the largest possible value of $ xy $? Then define $ k = (\\text{largest } xy) - 231 $. Find $ k $.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning for Problem 1**:\n\nWe are maximizing the product $ xy $ given that $ x + y = 31 $, and $ x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ $ (positive integers).\n\nFor a fixed sum, the product $ xy $ is maximized when $ x $ and $ y $ are as close as possible to each other (by AM-GM inequality or symmetry of quadratic). Since $ x + y = 31 $, which is odd, the closest integers are $ x = 15 $, $ y = 16 $ (or vice versa).\n\nCheck:  \n$ 15 + 16 = 31 $, product = $ 15 \\times 16 = 240 $.\n\nAre there any other integer pairs? Let's verify extremes:  \n- $ x = 1, y = 30 \\Rightarrow xy = 30 $  \n- $ x = 2, y = 29 \\Rightarrow 58 $  \n- ... increasing up to middle.\n\nSo yes, max occurs at $ (15,16) $ or $ (16,15) $, product = 240.\n\nThen $ k = 240 - 231 = 9 $.\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **9**.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2**:  \nHow many points on the line segment joining $ (-9,-2) $ and $ (6,8) $ have **both coordinates integers**?\n\nThat is, how many **lattice points** lie on the segment (including endpoints)?\n\nStandard method: The number of lattice points on the line segment between two lattice points $ (x_1, y_1) $ and $ (x_2, y_2) $ is:\n\n$$\n\\gcd(|x_2 - x_1|, |y_2 - y_1|) + 1\n$$\n\nWhy? Because the vector from start to end is $ (\\Delta x, \\Delta y) $, and the number of equally spaced lattice points along it equals the number of times you can step by the reduced direction vector — i.e., the gcd gives the number of equal subdivisions; adding 1 includes both endpoints.\n\nCompute:\n\n- $ \\Delta x = 6 - (-9) = 15 $  \n- $ \\Delta y = 8 - (-2) = 10 $\n\nSo $ \\gcd(15, 10) = 5 $\n\nTherefore, number of lattice points = $ 5 + 1 = 6 $\n\nLet’s double-check by finding parametric form:\n\nSegment: $ (x(t), y(t)) = (-9 + 15t,\\ -2 + 10t) $, where $ t \\in [0,1] $\n\nWe want both coordinates integers ⇒ need $ -9 + 15t \\in \\mathbb{Z} $ and $ -2 + 10t \\in \\mathbb{Z} $. Since $ -9 $ and $ -2 $ are integers, need $ 15t $ and $ 10t $ integers ⇒ $ t = \\frac{k}{\\text{lcm}(15,10)} = \\frac{k}{30} $, but more precisely, $ t = \\frac{m}{d} $ where $ d = \\gcd(15,10) = 5 $, so $ t = 0, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{4}{5}, 1 $ → 6 values.\n\nIndeed:\n\n- $ t = 0 $: $ (-9,-2) $  \n- $ t = 1/5 $: $ x = -9 + 3 = -6 $, $ y = -2 + 2 = 0 $ → $ (-6, 0) $  \n- $ t = 2/5 $: $ x = -9 + 6 = -3 $, $ y = -2 + 4 = 2 $ → $ (-3, 2) $  \n- $ t = 3/5 $: $ x = -9 + 9 = 0 $, $ y = -2 + 6 = 4 $ → $ (0, 4) $  \n- $ t = 4/5 $: $ x = -9 + 12 = 3 $, $ y = -2 + 8 = 6 $ → $ (3, 6) $  \n- $ t = 1 $: $ (6, 8) $\n\nAll integer coordinates. So total = 6.\n\n✅ Answer to Problem 2 is **6**.\n\n---\n\nNow format final answer in required JSON.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: For positive integers x and y with x + y = 31, the product xy is maximized when x and y are as close as possible, i.e., 15 and 16, giving xy = 240.
