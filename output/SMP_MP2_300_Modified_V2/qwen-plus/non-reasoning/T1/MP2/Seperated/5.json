But we are *not* asked to find the actual start time — instead, define $ k = h + 7 $, where $ h $ is the remainder when 100 is divided by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day).  \n\nSo compute $ 100 \\div 24 $:  \n$ 24 \\times 4 = 96 $, remainder $ 100 - 96 = 4 $. So $ h = 4 $.  \nThen $ k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 $.  \n\nThat’s all we need for Problem 1.\n\nProblem 2:  \nWe have the list: $ 2, 3, 4, 6 $. We must pick three *different* numbers whose sum is 11. Let's list all combinations of 3 distinct numbers from this set:\n\n- 2, 3, 4 → sum = 9  \n- 2, 3, 6 → sum = 11 ✅  \n- 2, 4, 6 → sum = 12  \n- 3, 4, 6 → sum = 13  \n\nOnly 2, 3, 6 sum to 11. Their product is $ 2 \\times 3 \\times 6 = 36 $.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Compute remainder h when 100 is divided by 24: 100 = 24×4 + 4, so h = 4. Then k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11.
