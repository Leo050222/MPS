Then:  \n$ t_M = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{100}{5/4} = 100 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 80 $ seconds.  \n\nHana finished 5 seconds before Megan, so Hana’s time $ t_H = t_M - 5 = 80 - 5 = 75 $ seconds.  \n\nHana’s average speed = $ \\frac{100}{t_H} = \\frac{100}{75} = \\frac{4}{3} $ m/s ≈ 1.333... m/s.  \n\nAs a fraction: $ \\frac{4}{3} $.
