Instead of determining the time lag in minutes between the two riders' completion times, simply find $f = t_B - \\frac{5}{4}$, where $t_B$ is the time in hours required for the rider with the slower speed to complete the trip."

That means:  \n$ 0.5 \\cdot N = 16 \\Rightarrow N = \\frac{16}{0.5} = 32 $.\n\nNow compute 75% of $ N $:  \n$ 0.75 \\cdot 32 = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 32 = 24 $.\n\nSo answer for Problem 2 is 24.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Bri's time to complete 30 km at 15 km/h is 30/15 = 2 hours. Then f = t_B - 5/4 = 2 - 1.25 = 0.75 = 3/4. Problem 2: 50% of N = 16 implies N = 32. Then 75% of N = 0.75 * 32 = 24.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3/4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"24\"\n}",
