      "A3077": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$."

  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:  \nWe are told the ratio of skateboards to bicycles is 7:4. So let the number of skateboards be $7k$ and bicycles be $4k$, for some positive integer $k$.  \nWe’re also told there were 12 more skateboards than bicycles:  \n$$\n7k = 4k + 12\n$$  \nSubtract $4k$ from both sides:  \n$$\n3k = 12 \\Rightarrow k = 4\n$$  \nNow compute $d = k + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10$.\n\nProblem 2:  \nShuxin starts with:\n- Red: 10  \n- Yellow: 7  \n- Blue: 3  \n\nShe eats some candies, and after eating, the remaining numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies are equal. Let that common remaining count be $r$. Since she can’t have more remaining than she started with, $r$ must satisfy:\n- $r \\leq 10$ (red),\n- $r \\leq 7$ (yellow),\n- $r \\leq 3$ (blue).\n\nSo the maximum possible $r$ is 3 (the smallest starting count). To minimize the number eaten, we want to maximize the number remaining — i.e., make $r$ as large as possible while satisfying all constraints. So $r = 3$ is the largest possible equal remainder.\n\nThen remaining candies: 3 red, 3 yellow, 3 blue → total remaining = 9.  \nInitial total = 10 + 7 + 3 = 20.  \nSo candies eaten = 20 − 9 = 11.\n\nCheck if smaller number eaten is possible: suppose $r = 2$: remaining = 6, eaten = 14 → larger.  \n$r = 1$: eaten = 17.  \n$r = 0$: eaten = 20.  \nSo minimal eaten occurs at maximal feasible $r = 3$, giving 11 eaten.\n\nThus smallest possible number eaten is 11.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let skateboards = 7k, bicycles = 4k. Given 7k = 4k + 12 → 3k = 12 → k = 4. Then d = k + 6 = 10. Problem 2: Initial counts: red=10, yellow=7, blue=3. To have equal remaining amounts, the common remainder r cannot exceed the smallest initial count, which is 3 (blue). So max r = 3. Remaining total = 3+3+3 = 9. Initial total = 20. Eaten = 20−9 = 11. Any smaller r increases eaten count, so 11 is minimal.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
