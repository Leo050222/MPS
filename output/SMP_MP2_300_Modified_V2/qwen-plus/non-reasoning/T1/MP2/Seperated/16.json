Let's solve them step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 1:**\n\nFlowchart:  \nINPUT → Subtract 8 → □ → Divide by 2 → □ → Add 16 → OUTPUT = 32  \n\nWe are told to find $ k = A - 26 $, where $ A $ is the intermediate quantity at the **first square**, i.e., right after \"Subtract 8\".\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- INPUT = $ x $  \n- After subtracting 8: $ A = x - 8 $  \n- Then divide by 2: $ \\frac{A}{2} = \\frac{x - 8}{2} $  \n- Then add 16: $ \\frac{x - 8}{2} + 16 = \\text{OUTPUT} = 32 $\n\nSo set up equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{x - 8}{2} + 16 = 32\n$$\n\nSubtract 16 from both sides:\n\n$$\n\\frac{x - 8}{2} = 16\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n$$\nx - 8 = 32\n$$\n\nSo $ x = 40 $\n\nThen $ A = x - 8 = 40 - 8 = 32 $\n\nThen $ k = A - 26 = 32 - 26 = 6 $\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 1 is **6**\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\nOriginal line: $ y = x + 4 $  \nThe y-intercept is the value of $ y $ when $ x = 0 $:  \n$ y = 0 + 4 = 4 $\n\nNow translate the line **down 6 units**: that means subtract 6 from the y-value everywhere → new equation is:\n\n$$\ny_{\\text{new}} = (x + 4) - 6 = x - 2\n$$\n\nSo new y-intercept is when $ x = 0 $: $ y = -2 $\n\n✅ So answer to Problem 2 is **-2**\n\n---\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let INPUT = x. After subtracting 8, we get A = x - 8. Then dividing by 2 gives (x - 8)/2, and adding 16 yields output: (x - 8)/2 + 16 = 32. Solving: (x - 8)/2 = 16 → x - 8 = 32 → x = 40. So A = 40 - 8 = 32. Then k = A - 26 = 32 - 26 = 6. Problem 2: Original y-intercept of y = x + 4 is 4. Translating down 6 units subtracts 6 from the entire function: y = x + 4 - 6 = x - 2.
