  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1: We are told to compute $ k = |S| + 2016 $, where $ S = \\{-3, -1, 0, 2, 4\\} $. The set has 5 elements: -3, -1, 0, 2, 4. So $ |S| = 5 $. Therefore, $ k = 5 + 2016 = 2021 $.\n\nNote: Although the problem initially describes a probability scenario involving selecting two different numbers and multiplying them, it explicitly says: “Instead of determining the probability … simply find $ k = |S| + 2016 $”. So we ignore the probability part and just compute $ |S| + 2016 $.\n\nProblem 2: We are given $ 45a + b = 2021 $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are positive integers (so $ a \\geq 1 $, $ b \\geq 1 $). We want to minimize $ a + b $.\n\nFrom the equation: $ b = 2021 - 45a $. Since $ b \\geq 1 $, we require:\n$$\n2021 - 45a \\geq 1 \\implies 45a \\leq 2020 \\implies a \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2020}{45} \\right\\rfloor.\n$$\nCompute $ 45 \\times 44 = 1980 $, $ 45 \\times 45 = 2025 > 2020 $, so max $ a = 44 $.\n\nAlso, since $ a \\geq 1 $, $ a \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 44\\} $.\n\nNow $ a + b = a + (2021 - 45a) = 2021 - 44a $. So $ a + b = 2021 - 44a $. This is a decreasing linear function in $ a $: larger $ a $ gives smaller sum.\n\nSo to minimize $ a + b $, maximize $ a $, subject to $ b = 2021 - 45a \\geq 1 $.\n\nTry $ a = 44 $: then $ b = 2021 - 45 \\times 44 = 2021 - 1980 = 41 $. $ b = 41 \\geq 1 $, valid. Then $ a + b = 44 + 41 = 85 $.\n\nCheck $ a = 45 $: $ b = 2021 - 2025 = -4 < 1 $, invalid.\n\nSo maximum allowed $ a = 44 $, giving minimum $ a + b = 85 $.\n\nDouble-check: Is there any constraint that $ b $ must be positive integer? Yes — and 41 is positive. So answer is 85.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The set S = {-3, -1, 0, 2, 4} has 5 elements, so |S| = 5. Then k = |S| + 2016 = 5 + 2016 = 2021. Problem 2: From 45a + b = 2021 and a, b positive integers, solve for b = 2021 - 45a. To ensure b ≥ 1, need 45a ≤ 2020 → a ≤ floor(2020/45) = 44. Then a + b = a + (2021 - 45a) = 2021 - 44a, which decreases as a increases. So maximum a = 44 gives minimum sum: b = 2021 - 45*44 = 41, so a + b = 44 + 41 = 85.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2021\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"85\"\n}",
