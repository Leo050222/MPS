  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:  \nWe are told a cube has edge length 30.  \nSurface area of a cube = 6 × (edge length)² = 6 × 30² = 6 × 900 = 5400.  \nSo S = 5400.  \nThen h = S − 5397 = 5400 − 5397 = 3.  \nNote: The rectangular solid info is a red herring — the problem explicitly says “Instead of determining the third edge length… simply find h = S − 5397”, and S is defined as the surface area of the cube. So we only need to compute the cube’s surface area.\n\nProblem 2:  \nOriginal line: y = x.  \nTranslating 3 units to the right means replacing x with (x − 3):  \ny = (x − 3).  \nThen translating 2 units down means subtracting 2 from the entire expression:  \ny = (x − 3) − 2 = x − 5.  \nSo the resulting line is y = x − 5.  \nThe y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0: y = 0 − 5 = −5.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Surface area of cube with edge length 30 is 6 * 30^2 = 6 * 900 = 5400. Then h = S - 5397 = 5400 - 5397 = 3. Problem 2: Original line y = x. Translate 3 units right: replace x with (x - 3), giving y = x - 3. Then translate 2 units down: subtract 2, giving y = x - 5.
