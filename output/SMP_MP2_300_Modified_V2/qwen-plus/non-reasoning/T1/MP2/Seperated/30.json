  "reasoning_content": "Let's solve each problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 1**:  \nAnna thinks of an integer that is:\n- Not a multiple of three → i.e., its digit sum is not divisible by 3 (since divisibility by 3 depends on digit sum), but note: the condition is on the number itself, not just digit sum — however, it's equivalent: a number is divisible by 3 iff its digit sum is divisible by 3.\n- Not a perfect square.\n- The sum of its digits is a prime number.\n\nWe are *not* asked to find such an integer explicitly, but rather compute:\n\n> $ k = $ (sum of its digits) + 108.\n\nSo we need to find *some* integer satisfying the three conditions, compute its digit sum (which must be prime), then add 108.\n\nSo essentially, we need to find *a prime number p* such that there exists an integer whose digit sum is p, and the integer is:\n- not divisible by 3 → since digit sum = p, this means p ≠ 0 mod 3 → i.e., p ≠ 3, 6, 9, ... but p is prime, so only p = 3 is a prime divisible by 3. So p ≠ 3.\n- not a perfect square.\n\nSo pick a small prime p ≠ 3, say p = 2, 5, 7, 11, etc., and ensure there exists a number with digit sum p that is not a perfect square and not divisible by 3.\n\nLet’s try smallest possible candidates.\n\nTry p = 2 → digit sum = 2. Smallest such numbers: 2, 11, 20, 101, etc.\n\n- 2: not divisible by 3? Yes (2 mod 3 = 2). Is 2 a perfect square? No. Digit sum = 2 → prime. So 2 satisfies all conditions.\n\nSo digit sum = 2 ⇒ k = 2 + 108 = 110.\n\nBut wait — check: is 2 a multiple of 3? No. Is 2 a perfect square? No (1²=1, 2²=4). Sum of digits = 2 → prime. ✅\n\nSo k = 110.\n\nCould there be ambiguity? The problem says “What could the integer be?” — i.e., *any* such integer works; we just need one. So using 2 is valid.\n\nThus answer for Problem 1 is 110.\n\n(Just to verify other small options: p = 5 → e.g., number 5: not multiple of 3, not square, digit sum 5 → prime ⇒ k = 113. But the question doesn’t ask for all possibilities — just “what could the integer be”, and then compute k = digit sum + 108. Since multiple answers are possible, but the problem expects a single answer, likely the smallest/simplest. And 2 is valid, gives k = 110.)\n\nSo we’ll go with **110**.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2**:  \nEwan writes out a sequence where he counts by 11s starting at 3.\n\nSo sequence is:  \n3, 3 + 11 = 14, 14 + 11 = 25, 36, 47, 58, 69, 80, 91, 102, 113, ...\n\nGeneral term: a_n = 3 + 11(n−1), for n = 1,2,3,...\n\nSo terms are all integers congruent to 3 mod 11.\n\nThe question is: “Which number will appear in Ewan's sequence?”\n\nBut the problem as stated seems incomplete — it doesn’t give options or a specific target. However, perhaps it's implied that we should give *an example*, or maybe it's a standard question expecting the *form*, but the instruction says “Which number will appear…” — likely expects *one* such number (e.g., the first few, or maybe a specific one like the 10th term? But no index given.)\n\nWait — re-read: “Ewan writes out a sequence where he counts by 11s starting at 3. Which number will appear in Ewan's sequence?”\n\nThis is oddly phrased — unless it's a multiple-choice question missing options, but here no options are given. However, in many standardized problems, this type of question expects you to recognize the pattern and perhaps give the *general form*, but the answer format expects a concrete value (e.g., \"47\", not a formula).\n\nBut maybe it's a trick — *any* number ≡ 3 (mod 11) appears. But the question says “Which number will appear”, implying a specific one — perhaps the smallest positive one? That’s 3.\n\nBut 3 is trivial — and appears first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's expecting us to realize that, for example, 100 is not in the sequence, but 102 is (since 3 + 11×9 = 3 + 99 = 102), but again — no context.\n\nWait — perhaps this is from a known problem set where options are implied, but here none are given. Let's consider if there's a canonical answer.\n\nSequence: 3, 14, 25, 36, 47, 58, 69, 80, 91, 102, 113, 124, 135, 146, 157, 168, 179, 190, 201, ...\n\nAll numbers of the form 11k + 3.\n\nSince the question asks “Which number will appear”, and no further constraint, the safest answer is the *first term*: **3**.\n\nBut let’s double-check if maybe the problem expects a particular number — e.g., maybe “the smallest two-digit number” → 14; or “smallest three-digit” → 102.\n\nBut nothing specifies.\n\nHowever, looking back at Problem 1, it was well-defined and had a unique answer once you pick the smallest valid integer (2). Similarly, here, the most natural answer is the starting number: **3**, since it's guaranteed to appear (it's the first term).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is incomplete, but per instructions, we must provide *an* answer.\n\nGiven that, and consistency with minimal choice, answer is **3**.\n\nBut wait — let’s see if “counts by 11s starting at 3” could be interpreted as: start at 3, then add 11 repeatedly → yes, so 3 is included.\n\nHence answer for Problem 2 is **3**.\n\nHowever — hold on. Sometimes “counting by 11s starting at 3” might be misinterpreted as listing multiples of 11 starting from 3, but that doesn’t make sense (multiples of 11 start at 0 or 11). No — standard interpretation is arithmetic sequence with difference 11, first term 3.\n\nSo yes, 3 is in the sequence.\n\nThus final answers:\n- Problem 1: 110\n- Problem 2: 3\n\nNow format as JSON.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, Anna's integer must not be a multiple of 3, not a perfect square, and have a prime digit sum. The integer 2 satisfies all conditions: it is not divisible by 3, not a perfect square, and its digit sum is 2, which is prime. Thus k = 2 + 108 = 110. For Problem 2, Ewan's sequence is an arithmetic sequence starting at 3 with common difference 11: 3, 14, 25, ..., so the number 3 appears in the sequence.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"110\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
