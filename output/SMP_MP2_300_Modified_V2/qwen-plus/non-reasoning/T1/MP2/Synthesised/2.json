  "math_problem": "Let $s(n)$ denote the number of 1's in the binary representation of $n$. Compute $$\\frac{1}{255} \\sum_{0 \\leq n<16} 2^{n}(-1)^{s(n)}$$ Instead of evaluating the provided expression, simply find $k = T + 46$, where $T = \\sum_{n=0}^{7} 2^{n} (-1)^{s(n)}$ is the alternating sum over the subrange of length 8. You plan to open your own Tmall.com store, called 'Store B,' selling the same headphones and speaker set at the same list prices as Store A does. Your store sells only these two models. You plan to issue 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupons, limited to one per order, where x is an integer greater than 0 and smaller than 99. (For example, the discount for an order of 250 RMB is x RMB, not 2x RMB). The Tmall.com '60 RMB off 299 RMB' coupon can be applied to purchases at store B and can be stacked with your 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupon. What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least $k$ RMB less on either the $(k + 249)$ RMB pair of the headphones or the $(k + 599)$ RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A? What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least $k$ RMB less for buying both the $(k + 249)$ RMB pair of the headphones and the $(k + 599)$ RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?",

So $ k = 1 $\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand the coupon scenario\n\nWe have:\n\n- Store A and Store B sell same items at same list prices.\n- Store B offers an “x RMB off 99 RMB” coupon, one per order, x integer, 0 < x < 99.\n- Also, Tmall’s “60 RMB off 299 RMB” coupon applies and can be stacked with yours.\n\nSo total discount per order = x + 60, **but only if both coupons’ conditions are satisfied**.\n\nImportant: Coupons are conditional:\n\n- Your coupon: “x RMB off 99 RMB” → applies only if order ≥ 99 RMB; gives discount x RMB (flat, not %).\n- Tmall coupon: “60 RMB off 299 RMB” → applies only if order ≥ 299 RMB; gives discount 60 RMB.\n\nThey can be stacked ⇒ both must apply ⇒ order must be ≥ max(99, 299) = 299 RMB.\n\nSo to get full x + 60 discount, order must be ≥ 299 RMB.\n\nNow question says:\n\n> What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend **at least k RMB less** on **either** the (k + 249) RMB pair of headphones **or** the (k + 599) RMB speaker set in Store B than in Store A?\n\nAlso:\n\n> What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend **at least k RMB less** for buying **both** the (k + 249) RMB headphones and the (k + 599) RMB speakers set in Store B than in Store A?\n\nBut note: k = 1.\n\nSo:\n\n- Headphones price = k + 249 = 1 + 249 = 250 RMB  \n- Speakers price = k + 599 = 1 + 599 = 600 RMB  \n- Both together = 250 + 600 = 850 RMB\n\nWe want Xiao Ming to save **at least k = 1 RMB**, i.e., ≥ 1 RMB, by using coupons at Store B vs Store A.\n\nSince Store A has no coupons (assumed — only Store B issues its own, and Tmall coupon applies to both stores? Wait — read carefully.)\n\nActually: “The Tmall.com '60 RMB off 299 RMB' coupon can be applied to purchases at store B and can be stacked with your 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupon.”\n\nIt doesn’t say it’s available at Store A — but since it’s a platform-wide Tmall coupon, likely it’s available at both stores. But the problem says “can be applied to purchases at store B”, implying perhaps it’s usable there — but maybe also at Store A? However, the comparison is “spend less in Store B than in Store A”.\n\nSo to compute savings, we need:\n\n- Cost at Store A = list price (no extra discounts mentioned for Store A — only that Store B offers its own coupon; Tmall coupon is platform-wide, so if it's available at Store A too, then it wouldn’t give extra saving at B unless Store B’s coupon adds extra).\n\nBut the problem says: “You plan to open your own Tmall.com store… Your store sells only these two models. You plan to issue ‘x RMB off 99 RMB’ coupons… The Tmall.com ‘60 RMB off 299 RMB’ coupon can be applied to purchases at store B and can be stacked with your coupon.”\n\nIt does **not** say Store A offers any coupon — nor that the Tmall coupon is unavailable at Store A. But to get *extra* saving at Store B, the key is that Store B allows stacking your coupon *on top of* the Tmall coupon — whereas maybe Store A doesn’t offer a similar coupon, or perhaps the Tmall coupon is available everywhere, but only Store B adds extra discount.\n\nHowever, the problem asks: “spend at least k RMB less on … in your Store B than in Store A”.\n\nSo we assume:\n\n- At Store A: customer pays full list price (no coupons offered by Store A; Tmall coupon may or may not apply — but if it does apply at Store A too, then it cancels out, and only Store B’s extra coupon matters).\n\nBut the problem states the Tmall coupon “can be applied to purchases at store B” — wording suggests it’s applicable there, but doesn’t confirm applicability at Store A. To maximize saving at B, safest interpretation is:\n\n- At Store A: no coupons → pay full price  \n- At Store B: can use both Tmall’s 60-off-299 AND your x-off-99, if conditions met.\n\nThat matches typical contest problem logic: Store A is baseline (no discounts), Store B offers extra incentives.\n\nSo:\n\n- Store A cost = list price  \n- Store B cost = list price − (discounts applicable)\n\nDiscounts applicable depend on order amount.\n\nLet’s analyze both cases.\n\n#### Case 1: Buying **only headphones**: 250 RMB\n\n- At Store A: 250  \n- At Store B: can he use coupons?\n\nYour coupon: “x off 99” → requires ≥99 → yes, 250 ≥ 99 → gives x off  \nTmall coupon: “60 off 299” → requires ≥299 → 250 < 299 → **cannot use**  \nSo only x off → Store B cost = 250 − x  \nSavings = x  \nWe need savings ≥ k = 1 ⇒ x ≥ 1  \nSince x is integer > 0 and < 99, minimal x = 1\n\nBut wait — is that sufficient? Let's hold.\n\n#### Case 2: Buying **only speakers**: 600 RMB\n\n- Store A: 600  \n- Store B: 600 ≥ 299 and ≥ 99 ⇒ both coupons apply ⇒ discount = x + 60  \n→ cost = 600 − x − 60 = 540 − x  \nSavings = x + 60  \nNeed ≥ 1 ⇒ automatically true for any x ≥ 1.\n\nSo for “either” item, the stricter condition is the headphones (since speakers give huge saving even for x = 1). So minimal x such that **either** gives ≥1 saving is x = 1.\n\nBut wait — the question says:\n\n> What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least k RMB less on **either** the (k + 249) RMB pair of the headphones **or** the (k + 599) RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?\n\nSo “either” means: ∃ one of them where saving ≥ k. So minimal x where saving on headphones ≥ 1 OR saving on speakers ≥ 1.\n\nSaving on headphones = x (since only your coupon applies)  \nSaving on speakers = x + 60  \nSo smallest x where min(x, x+60) ≥ 1? No — it's OR, so we need x ≥ 1 OR x+60 ≥ 1. Since x > 0, x ≥ 1 always makes x ≥ 1, so x = 1 suffices.\n\nSo answer for first part is 1.\n\nBut wait — read again: the problem says:\n\n> What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least $k$ RMB less on either the $(k + 249)$ RMB pair of the headphones or the $(k + 599)$ RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?  \n> What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least $k$ RMB less for buying both the $(k + 249)$ RMB pair of the headphones and the $(k + 599)$ RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?\n\nIt’s asking **two questions**, but the way it's phrased, it seems like it wants the x satisfying **both** conditions? Or is it two separate questions? The wording is ambiguous.\n\nLet’s read exactly:\n\n> What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least $k$ RMB less on either the $(k + 249)$ RMB pair of the headphones or the $(k + 599)$ RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?  \n> What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least $k$ RMB less for buying both the $(k + 249)$ RMB pair of the headphones and the $(k + 599)$ RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?\n\nIt's two questions. But the problem says “What is the minimal number x such that … ? What is the minimal number x such that … ?” — likely expects a single answer? Or maybe it's a trick and both yield same x?\n\nBut let’s compute second part.\n\n#### Case 3: Buying **both** items: 250 + 600 = 850 RMB\n\n- Store A: 850  \n- Store B: order = 850 ≥ 299 and ≥ 99 ⇒ both coupons apply ⇒ discount = x + 60  \n→ cost = 850 − x − 60 = 790 − x  \nSavings = x + 60  \nNeed savings ≥ k = 1 ⇒ x + 60 ≥ 1 ⇒ x ≥ −59, but x > 0, so again x = 1 suffices.\n\nSo for both interpretations, x = 1 works.\n\nBut wait — is there a catch? Let's re-read coupon wording:\n\n> “x RMB off 99 RMB” coupons, limited to one per order\n\nand\n\n> “The Tmall.com '60 RMB off 299 RMB' coupon can be applied to purchases at store B and can be stacked with your 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupon.”\n\nSo stacking is allowed — meaning total discount is sum, as long as thresholds are met.\n\nFor headphones alone (250), only your coupon applies → discount x  \nFor speakers alone (600), both apply → discount x + 60  \nFor both (850), both apply → discount x + 60\n\nSo minimal x to guarantee ≥1 saving in each case:\n\n- Headphones only: need x ≥ 1  \n- Speakers only: x + 60 ≥ 1 → always true  \n- Both: x + 60 ≥ 1 → always true\n\nSo overall minimal x is 1.\n\nBut the problem says “Xiao Ming can spend at least k RMB less on either … or …” — i.e., for at least one of the options, saving ≥ k. So x = 1 works.\n\nAnd “for buying both … than in Store A” — saving = x + 60 ≥ 1 → x = 1 works.\n\nHence answer is 1.\n\nBut wait — is there any constraint that x must be such that the coupon is *usable*? For headphones (250), your coupon applies (250 ≥ 99), so yes.\n\nThus minimal x is 1.\n\nBut let’s verify k again — could we have miscomputed T?\n\nT = sum_{n=0}^7 2^n (-1)^{s(n)} = -45 ⇒ k = 1 — solid.\n\nAll downstream depends on k = 1.\n\nHence answer is 1.\n\nBut the problem says “Instead of evaluating the provided expression, simply find k = T + 46”, and then uses k in coupon problem — and asks for minimal x.\n\nSo final answer is 1.\n\nBut wait — the original expression was:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{255} \\sum_{0 \\leq n<16} 2^{n}(-1)^{s(n)}$$\n\nWe didn’t need to compute it — problem says “Instead of evaluating the provided expression, simply find k = T + 46”, so we did right.\n\nThus answer is 1.\n\nBut let me just cross-validate T with another method.\n\nNote: The sequence $ (-1)^{s(n)} $ is the Thue–Morse sequence: t_n = (-1)^{s(n)}.\n\nValues for n = 0 to 7:  \ns(n): 0,1,1,2,1,2,2,3 → mod 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1 → (-1)^s: 1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1 — matches our table.\n\nAnd sum 2^n t_n from 0 to 7 is known? Let's compute again numerically:\n\nn: 0 to 7  \n2^n: [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128]  \nt_n: [1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1]  \nProducts: [1, -2, -4, 8, -16, 32, 64, -128]  \nSum = 1 -2 = -1; -1 -4 = -5; -5 +8 = 3; 3 -16 = -13; -13 +32 = 19; 19 +64 = 83; 83 -128 = -45 ✅\n\nSo k = 1.\n\nTherefore minimal x is 1.\n\nFinal answer is 1.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We computed s(n), the number of 1's in binary representation of n, for n = 0 to 7. Then evaluated T = sum_{n=0}^7 2^n (-1)^{s(n)} = -45. Thus k = T + 46 = 1. The headphone price is k + 249 = 250 RMB, speaker price is k + 599 = 600 RMB. For the headphones alone, only the 'x off 99' coupon applies (since 250 < 299), giving discount x; to save at least k = 1 RMB, x >= 1. Since x must be a positive integer less than 99, the minimal such x is 1. This also satisfies the condition for the speakers alone and for buying both, as those allow stacking with the Tmall coupon for larger discounts. Hence the minimal x is 1.\",  \n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
