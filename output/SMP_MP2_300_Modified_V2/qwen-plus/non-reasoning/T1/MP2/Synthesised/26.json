  "math_problem": "Storage space on a computer is measured in gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB), where $1 \\mathrm{~GB} = 1024 \\mathrm{MB}$. Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes. The regular price for a bicycle is $\\\\$(d + 220)$. The bicycle is on sale for $(d - 80)\\\\%$ off. The regular price for a helmet is $\\\\$(d - 20)$. The helmet is on sale for $(d - 90)\\\\%$ off. If Sandra bought both items on sale, what is her percentage savings on the total purchase?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-step problem. Let's break it down carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Compute total capacity $ C $ in MB\n\nJulia has a **300 GB** hard drive.\n\nGiven:  \n$ 1 \\text{ GB} = 1024 \\text{ MB} $\n\nSo,  \n$$\nC = 300 \\times 1024 = 307200 \\text{ MB}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Compute $ d = C - 307100 $\n\n$$\nd = 307200 - 307100 = 100\n$$\n\nSo, $ d = 100 $\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Prices and discounts\n\n- Regular price of bicycle = $ d + 220 = 100 + 220 = 320 $ dollars  \n- Bicycle discount = $ d - 80 = 100 - 80 = 20\\% $ off  \n  → So sale price = $ 320 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 320 \\times 0.80 = 256 $\n\n- Regular price of helmet = $ d - 20 = 100 - 20 = 80 $ dollars  \n- Helmet discount = $ d - 90 = 100 - 90 = 10\\% $ off  \n  → So sale price = $ 80 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 80 \\times 0.90 = 72 $\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Total regular price and total sale price\n\n- Total regular price = $ 320 + 80 = 400 $  \n- Total sale price = $ 256 + 72 = 328 $\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Percentage savings on total purchase\n\nSavings = $ 400 - 328 = 72 $  \nPercentage savings =  \n$$\n\\frac{72}{400} \\times 100\\% = 18\\%\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The hard drive capacity is 300 GB = 300 × 1024 = 307200 MB. Then d = 307200 − 307100 = 100. Bicycle regular price = 100 + 220 = 320; 20% off → sale price = 320 × 0.8 = 256. Helmet regular price = 100 − 20 = 80; 10% off → sale price = 80 × 0.9 = 72. Total regular price = 320 + 80 = 400. Total sale price = 256 + 72 = 328. Savings = 400 − 328 = 72. Percentage savings = (72/400) × 100 = 18%.\",  \n    \"answer\": \"18\"\n}",
