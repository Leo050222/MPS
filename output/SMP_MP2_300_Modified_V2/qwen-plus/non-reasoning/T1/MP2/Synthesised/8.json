  "math_problem": "A cube has an edge length of 30. A rectangular solid has edge lengths 20, 30, and $L$. If the cube and the rectangular solid have equal surface areas, what is the value of $L$? Instead of determining the third edge length of the rectangular solid, simply find $h = S - 5397$, where $S$ is the surface area of the cube. The line with equation $y = x$ is translated $h$ units to the right and $(h - 1)$ units down. What is the $y$-intercept of the resulting line?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a cube with edge length 30.\n\nStep 1: Compute the surface area $ S $ of the cube.\n\nA cube has 6 faces, each a square of side length 30.\n\nSo,\n$$\nS = 6 \\times 30^2 = 6 \\times 900 = 5400\n$$\n\nStep 2: Compute $ h = S - 5397 $\n\n$$\nh = 5400 - 5397 = 3\n$$\n\nStep 3: The line $ y = x $ is translated $ h = 3 $ units to the right and $ h - 1 = 2 $ units down.\n\nRecall how translations affect equations:\n\n- Translating right by $ a $ units replaces $ x $ with $ x - a $.\n- Translating down by $ b $ units subtracts $ b $ from the entire expression.\n\nSo starting from $ y = x $:\n\n- Translate right by 3: replace $ x $ with $ x - 3 $ → $ y = x - 3 $\n- Then translate down by 2: subtract 2 → $ y = (x - 3) - 2 = x - 5 $\n\nSo the resulting line is:\n$$\ny = x - 5\n$$\n\nThe $ y $-intercept is the value of $ y $ when $ x = 0 $:\n\n$$\ny = 0 - 5 = -5\n$$\n\nThus, the $ y $-intercept is $ -5 $.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The cube has edge length 30, so its surface area is 6 × 30² = 5400. Then h = 5400 − 5397 = 3. The line y = x is translated 3 units right and (3 − 1) = 2 units down. Right translation replaces x with x − 3, giving y = x − 3; then down translation subtracts 2, yielding y = x − 5. The y-intercept is found by setting x = 0: y = −5.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-5\"\n}",
