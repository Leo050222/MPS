  "math_problem": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$. Shuxin begins with $d$ red candies, $(d - 3)$ yellow candies, and $(d - 7)$ blue candies. After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining. What is the smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-step problem. Let's break it down carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Find $ d = k + 6 $, where $ k $ is the scaling factor such that:\n\n- Number of skateboards = $ 7k $\n- Number of bicycles = $ 4k $\n- There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles:\n\n$$\n7k - 4k = 12 \\Rightarrow 3k = 12 \\Rightarrow k = 4\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nd = k + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10\n$$\n\nSo $ d = 10 $\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Shuxin begins with:\n\n- Red candies: $ d = 10 $\n- Yellow candies: $ d - 3 = 7 $\n- Blue candies: $ d - 7 = 3 $\n\nSo initial counts:\n\n- Red: 10  \n- Yellow: 7  \n- Blue: 3  \n\nShe eats some candies, and after eating, the **remaining numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies are equal**.\n\nLet $ r $ be the number of each color remaining (i.e., red remaining = yellow remaining = blue remaining = $ r $).\n\nSince she can’t have negative candies eaten, and can’t have more remaining than she started with:\n\n- $ r \\leq 10 $ (red limit)  \n- $ r \\leq 7 $ (yellow limit)  \n- $ r \\leq 3 $ (blue limit)  \n\nSo maximum possible $ r = 3 $, since blue only has 3 to begin with.\n\nThus, the **largest possible equal remaining count is 3**, meaning:\n\n- Red remaining = 3 → ate $ 10 - 3 = 7 $ red  \n- Yellow remaining = 3 → ate $ 7 - 3 = 4 $ yellow  \n- Blue remaining = 3 → ate $ 3 - 3 = 0 $ blue  \n\nTotal eaten = $ 7 + 4 + 0 = 11 $\n\nBut the question asks for the **smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate**, given that after eating, the remaining numbers are equal.\n\nTo minimize total eaten, we want to **maximize** the common remaining count $ r $, because more remaining means less eaten.\n\nSo yes — maximize $ r $, subject to $ r \\leq \\min(10, 7, 3) = 3 $. So max $ r = 3 $, as above.\n\nSo minimum total eaten is when $ r = 3 $, giving 11.\n\nWait — but could $ r $ be less than 3? Yes — e.g., $ r = 2 $, then she eats more: $ (10-2)+(7-2)+(3-2) = 8+5+1 = 14 $, which is larger.\n\nSimilarly, $ r = 1 $ → eats $ 9 + 6 + 2 = 17 $, even more.\n\n$ r = 0 $ → eats all: $ 10 + 7 + 3 = 20 $\n\nSo indeed, **minimum eaten occurs when $ r $ is as large as possible**, i.e., $ r = 3 $, total eaten = 11.\n\nBut wait — is $ r = 3 $ allowed? Yes: she starts with 3 blue candies, so she can leave all 3 blue, and must leave only 3 red and 3 yellow — meaning she eats 7 red and 4 yellow. That’s fine.\n\nSo smallest possible number of candies eaten is **11**.\n\nBUT — double-check: Is there any constraint that she must eat *some* of each color? The problem says “after eating some of the candies”, and “some” usually means at least one, but in math contest problems, “some” can mean zero or more — however, if she eats zero candies, then remaining are 10, 7, 3 — not equal. So she must eat at least enough to make them equal.\n\nBut in our case, she eats 7 red, 4 yellow, 0 blue → total 11. That’s acceptable unless the problem implies she eats *some* of *each*, but it doesn’t say that. It says “some of the candies” — i.e., total some, not per color.\n\nSo 11 is valid.\n\nThus answer is 11.\n\nWait — let's re-read the exact wording:\n\n> After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining.\n\nThat’s satisfied when remaining are (3,3,3). She ate 7+4+0 = 11.\n\nYes.\n\nSo final answer is 11.\n\n---\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"From the ratio 7:4 and 12 more skateboards than bicycles, we solve 7k - 4k = 12 → k = 4. Then d = k + 6 = 10. So Shuxin starts with d = 10 red, d - 3 = 7 yellow, and d - 7 = 3 blue candies. To make remaining counts equal, the maximum possible equal remaining amount is min(10, 7, 3) = 3. Thus, she leaves 3 of each color, meaning she eats 10 - 3 = 7 red, 7 - 3 = 4 yellow, and 3 - 3 = 0 blue, totaling 7 + 4 + 0 = 11 candies. Since decreasing the common remaining count increases total eaten, 11 is the minimum possible.\",\n    \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
