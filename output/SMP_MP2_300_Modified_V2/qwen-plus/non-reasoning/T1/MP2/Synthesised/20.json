  "math_problem": "A bicycle trip is 30 km long. Ari rides at an average speed of 20 km/h. Bri rides at an average speed of 15 km/h. If Ari and Bri begin at the same time, how many minutes after Ari finishes the trip will Bri finish? Instead of determining the time lag in minutes between the two riders' completion times, simply find $f = t_B - \\frac{5}{4}$, where $t_B$ is the time in hours required for the rider with the slower speed to complete the trip. If $50\\\\% $ of $N$ is 16, what is $(100 f)\\\\% $ of $N$?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-step problem. Let's break it down carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the bicycle trip details\n\n- Total distance = 30 km  \n- Ari’s speed = 20 km/h  \n- Bri’s speed = 15 km/h  \n- Both start at same time.\n\nWe are told to compute:\n\n> $ f = t_B - \\frac{5}{4} $, where $ t_B $ is the time in hours required for the rider with the slower speed to complete the trip.\n\nSlower speed is Bri: 15 km/h.\n\nSo,\n\n$$\nt_B = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{30}{15} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nf = t_B - \\frac{5}{4} = 2 - \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} - \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\n\nSo $ f = \\frac{3}{4} $\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use the condition about N\n\n> 50% of $ N $ is 16.\n\nThat means:\n\n$$\n0.5 \\cdot N = 16 \\Rightarrow N = 32\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute $ (100 f)\\% $ of $ N $\n\nWe have $ f = \\frac{3}{4} $, so:\n\n$$\n100 f = 100 \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = 75\n$$\n\nSo $ (100 f)\\% = 75\\% $\n\nNow compute 75% of $ N = 32 $:\n\n$$\n0.75 \\cdot 32 = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 32 = 24\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n24\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Bri rides at 15 km/h for 30 km, so t_B = 30/15 = 2 hours. Then f = t_B - 5/4 = 2 - 1.25 = 0.75. Given 50% of N is 16, so N = 32. Then (100f)% = 75%, and 75% of 32 is 24.\",\n    \"answer\": \"24\"\n}",
