  "math_problem": "Each of four doors is randomly either open or closed. What is the probability that exactly two of the four doors are open? Instead of determining the probability of exactly two open doors among the four, simply find $Pr$, where $Pr$ is the probability that exactly two of the four doors are open derived from counting the favorable configurations among all possible states of the doors. The line with equation $y=2x-(Pr + 45/8)$ is translated upwards by 4 units. What is the $x$-intercept of the resulting line?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a probability problem involving four doors, each independently open or closed with equal likelihood.\n\nStep 1: Compute the probability $ Pr $ that exactly two of the four doors are open.\n\nEach door has two states: open or closed. So total number of possible configurations = $ 2^4 = 16 $.\n\nNumber of favorable configurations (exactly two doors open) = number of ways to choose 2 doors out of 4 to be open = $ \\binom{4}{2} = 6 $.\n\nSo,\n$$\nPr = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\n\nStep 2: Consider the line equation:\n$$\ny = 2x - \\left(Pr + \\frac{45}{8}\\right)\n$$\n\nSubstitute $ Pr = \\frac{3}{8} $:\n\n$$\nPr + \\frac{45}{8} = \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{45}{8} = \\frac{48}{8} = 6\n$$\n\nSo original line is:\n$$\ny = 2x - 6\n$$\n\nStep 3: Translate the line **upwards by 4 units**.\n\nTranslating upward means add 4 to the y-value: new line is:\n$$\ny_{\\text{new}} = y + 4 = (2x - 6) + 4 = 2x - 2\n$$\n\nSo resulting line: $ y = 2x - 2 $\n\nStep 4: Find the **x-intercept** of this line.\n\nSet $ y = 0 $:\n\n$$\n0 = 2x - 2 \\Rightarrow 2x = 2 \\Rightarrow x = 1\n$$\n\nThus, the x-intercept is $ 1 $.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"There are 2^4 = 16 total configurations of four doors. Exactly two open corresponds to C(4,2) = 6 configurations, so Pr = 6/16 = 3/8. Then Pr + 45/8 = 3/8 + 45/8 = 48/8 = 6, so original line is y = 2x - 6. Translating up by 4 gives y = 2x - 2. Setting y = 0 yields x = 1.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
