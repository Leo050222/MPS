  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-step problem. Let's break it down carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand Anna’s integer conditions\n\nAnna thinks of an integer that satisfies **all three**:\n\n- Not a multiple of 3 → i.e., sum of digits is **not divisible by 3**, since divisibility by 3 depends on digit sum.\n- Not a perfect square.\n- Sum of its digits is a **prime number**.\n\nSo, let the integer be $ n $, and let $ s = \\text{sum of digits of } n $. Then:\n\n- $ s $ is prime,\n- $ s \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $ — but since $ s $ is prime, the only prime divisible by 3 is 3 itself. So $ s \\ne 3 $ would ensure $ n $ is not divisible by 3. Wait — careful! The condition is “$ n $ is not a multiple of 3”, which is equivalent to “$ s \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $”. So if $ s = 3 $, then $ n $ *is* divisible by 3 → violates condition. So $ s $ must be a prime **≠ 3**, or possibly $ s = 3 $ but $ n $ not divisible by 3? No — that’s impossible: divisibility by 3 is *exactly* determined by digit sum mod 3. So if digit sum is 3, then $ n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $. So to satisfy “not a multiple of 3”, we must have $ s \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} $. Since $ s $ is prime, allowed primes are:  \nPrimes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, ...\n\nExclude those ≡ 0 mod 3 → only 3 is divisible by 3 among primes. So $ s $ can be any prime **except 3**.\n\nAlso, $ n $ must **not be a perfect square**.\n\nSo we need to find *some* integer $ n $ satisfying:\n\n- digit sum $ s \\in \\{2, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, ...\\} $\n- $ n $ is not a perfect square\n- $ n $ is not divisible by 3 (automatically satisfied if $ s \\ne 3 $)\n\nLet’s try small candidates.\n\nTry $ n = 2 $:  \n- digit sum = 2 → prime ✅  \n- 2 not divisible by 3 ✅  \n- 2 is not a perfect square ✅  \nSo $ n = 2 $ works!\n\nCheck:  \n- Not multiple of 3 → yes  \n- Not perfect square → yes (1²=1, 2²=4)  \n- Digit sum = 2 → prime ✅  \n\nSo $ n = 2 $ satisfies all.\n\nThen $ s = 2 $, so $ k = s + 108 = 2 + 108 = 110 $.\n\nBut wait — double-check: problem says:\n\n> Instead of identifying an integer satisfying the conditions [...] simply find $ k $ equal to the sum of the digits of such an integer plus 108.\n\nSo yes, $ k = s + 108 $. Since $ s = 2 $ works, $ k = 110 $.\n\nBut let’s verify if there’s any hidden constraint we missed.\n\nIs 2 allowed? It's an integer, not multiple of 3, not a perfect square, digit sum 2 is prime. Yes.\n\nCould there be other possible $ k $? The problem says “What could the integer be?” — i.e., *any* such integer is acceptable; we just need *one*. So pick the smallest/simplest.\n\nThus $ k = 110 $.\n\nHold on — let's test another candidate to make sure no ambiguity.\n\nTry $ n = 5 $: digit sum = 5 → prime, not divisible by 3, not a perfect square → also works → $ k = 5 + 108 = 113 $\n\nSo $ k $ is not uniquely determined unless the problem implies there's a unique answer — but it says “What could the integer be?” and then defines $ k = s + 108 $. So multiple $ k $ possible? But then Ewan’s sequence would depend on $ k $, and the final answer would not be unique — but the problem expects a unique answer.\n\nSo perhaps we missed a constraint.\n\nRe-read problem:\n\n> Anna thinks of an integer that is not a multiple of three, not a perfect square, and the sum of its digits is a prime number.\n\nNo other constraints — so many possibilities.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the *smallest positive* such integer? That would be 2, as above.\n\nBut let’s check $ n = 1 $: digit sum = 1 → not prime → invalid.\n\n$ n = 2 $: sum = 2 → prime → OK.\n\n$ n = 4 $: sum = 4 → not prime.\n\n$ n = 5 $: sum = 5 → prime → OK.\n\n$ n = 7 $: sum = 7 → OK.\n\n$ n = 8 $: sum = 8 → not prime.\n\n$ n = 10 $: sum = 1 → not prime.\n\n$ n = 11 $: sum = 2 → prime, not multiple of 3, not perfect square → OK → $ k = 110 $ again.\n\nSo many $ n $ give same $ s = 2 $, hence same $ k = 110 $.\n\nWhat about $ s = 5 $: e.g., $ n = 5, 14, 23, 32, 41, 50 $ — many, but $ k = 113 $.\n\nSo unless more constraints, $ k $ is not unique.\n\nBut problem asks: “Which number will appear in Ewan's sequence?” implying a unique answer.\n\nTherefore, likely the problem expects the *smallest possible* such integer, and/or the *smallest possible digit sum*, which is 2.\n\nAlso note: digit sum = 2 is the smallest prime ≠ 3, and gives smallest $ k $.\n\nLet’s proceed with $ k = 110 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Ewan’s sequence\n\nEwan writes out a sequence where he counts by $ (k - 102) $s starting at $ (k - 110) $.\n\nSo:\n\n- Common difference $ d = k - 102 $\n- First term $ a = k - 110 $\n\nWith $ k = 110 $:\n\n- $ d = 110 - 102 = 8 $\n- $ a = 110 - 110 = 0 $\n\nSo sequence is: $ 0,\\ 8,\\ 16,\\ 24,\\ 32,\\ \\dots $ — all multiples of 8.\n\nThe question: “Which number will appear in Ewan's sequence?”\n\nThat’s vague — *which* number? Every term appears. But likely it's asking for a specific term — maybe the first positive term? Or perhaps it's implied we need to find a particular number that *must* appear — but all multiples of 8 appear.\n\nWait — maybe the problem expects us to realize that regardless of $ k $, some number always appears? But no — depends on $ k $.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's only one $ k $ consistent with all constraints when considering that $ n $ must be *positive integer*, not a single-digit number? No, 2 is fine.\n\nWait — re-express Ewan’s sequence algebraically:\n\nGeneral term:  \n$ a_n = (k - 110) + (n-1)(k - 102) $, for $ n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots $\n\nSimplify:\n\n$ a_n = (k - 110) + (n-1)(k - 102) $  \n= $ k - 110 + (n-1)k - 102(n-1) $  \n= $ k - 110 + nk - k - 102n + 102 $  \n= $ nk - 102n - 8 $  \n= $ n(k - 102) - 8 $\n\nWait, let's recalculate carefully:\n\n$ a_n = a + (n-1)d = (k - 110) + (n-1)(k - 102) $\n\nExpand:\n\n= $ k - 110 + (n-1)k - 102(n-1) $  \n= $ k - 110 + nk - k - 102n + 102 $  \nNow $ k - k $ cancels:  \n= $ -110 + nk - 102n + 102 $  \n= $ nk - 102n - 8 $  \n= $ n(k - 102) - 8 $\n\nSo general term is $ n(k - 102) - 8 $.\n\nBut still depends on $ k $.\n\nHowever, maybe the problem expects us to find *a number that appears for any valid $ k $*? Unlikely.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps “which number will appear” means “what is the first term?” or “what is the common difference?” but wording is “which number will appear”, and in contest problems sometimes it's implied to give the *smallest positive* term, or something.\n\nWith $ k = 110 $, sequence starts at 0, step 8 → terms: 0, 8, 16, 24, ...\n\nSo smallest positive is 8.\n\nBut does 8 appear? Yes.\n\nBut maybe they want a specific term — perhaps the 1st term? That’s 0.\n\nBut 0 is an integer, and “appear in the sequence” — yes.\n\nBut maybe context implies positive integers? Unclear.\n\nWait — let's test if other $ k $ values could lead to same sequence property.\n\nSuppose $ s = 5 $ → $ k = 113 $  \nThen $ d = 113 - 102 = 11 $, $ a = 113 - 110 = 3 $  \nSequence: 3, 14, 25, 36, 47, 58, 69, 80, 91, 102, ...\n\nDoes 8 appear? No.\n\nSo answer depends on $ k $.\n\nHence uniqueness requires unique $ k $, so our earlier assumption that $ n = 2 $ is intended is correct.\n\nThus $ k = 110 $, sequence: starts at 0, step 8.\n\nNow, “Which number will appear in Ewan's sequence?” — still ambiguous.\n\nBut maybe it's a trick: the problem says “Ewan writes out a sequence where he counts by (k − 102)s starting at (k − 110)”.\n\n“Counts by Xs starting at Y” usually means arithmetic sequence: Y, Y+X, Y+2X, ...\n\nSo terms are all numbers congruent to $ Y \\mod X $, i.e., $ \\equiv (k - 110) \\pmod{(k - 102)} $\n\nCompute modulus:\n\nLet $ d = k - 102 $, then start = $ k - 110 = (k - 102) - 8 = d - 8 $\n\nSo sequence is: $ d - 8,\\ 2d - 8,\\ 3d - 8,\\ \\dots $ → all numbers of form $ md - 8 $, $ m \\ge 1 $\n\nSo $ a_m = m d - 8 $\n\nNow, what number is guaranteed? For $ m = 1 $: $ d - 8 = (k - 102) - 8 = k - 110 $ — that’s the first term.\n\nBut again, depends on $ k $.\n\nWait — maybe the problem expects us to compute a particular term, like the 10th? Not specified.\n\nLet’s read original problem again:\n\n> Ewan writes out a sequence where he counts by $(k - 102)$s starting at $(k - 110)$. Which number will appear in Ewan's sequence?\n\nThis is oddly phrased. In many math competition problems, when they say “counts by Xs starting at Y”, and ask “which number will appear”, they might mean “what is the common difference?” or “what is the first term?”, but here both depend on $ k $.\n\nBut perhaps there's a value that appears *regardless* of $ k $, or maybe the problem expects us to realize that $ k - 110 = 0 $ when $ k = 110 $, and $ k - 102 = 8 $, so sequence is multiples of 8, and perhaps they want the smallest positive term: 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe “which number” refers to a specific well-known number, like 0 or 8 or 108.\n\nWait — another thought: maybe Anna’s integer must be *greater than 10*? Or have at least two digits? Problem doesn’t say.\n\nLet’s test $ n = 11 $: digit sum = 2 → same $ k = 110 $. So same.\n\nWhat if $ n = 29 $: digit sum = 11 → prime, 11 mod 3 = 2 ≠ 0 → OK, not square → $ k = 119 $. Then $ d = 17 $, start = 9 → sequence: 9, 26, 43, ... no 8.\n\nSo only with $ s = 2 $ do we get $ k = 110 $.\n\nPerhaps the problem intends the *minimal possible digit sum*, which is 2, leading to $ k = 110 $.\n\nThus Ewan’s sequence: starts at 0, step 8 → includes 0, 8, 16, etc.\n\nNow, “Which number will appear?” — maybe it's asking for the *first term*, which is 0.\n\nBut “appears in the sequence” — 0 appears.\n\nIn many contexts, “counting by Xs starting at Y” might imply positive integers, but 0 is valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the 100th term? No info.\n\nWait — perhaps the problem is from a known source where “which number will appear” means “what is a number that must be in every such sequence?” But sequences differ.\n\nUnless… let's compute $ a = k - 110 $, $ d = k - 102 $, so $ d = a + 8 $, since $ (k - 102) = (k - 110) + 8 $.\n\nSo if we let $ a = $ first term, then common difference is $ a + 8 $.\n\nSo sequence: $ a,\\ 2a + 8,\\ 3a + 16,\\ \\dots $ — not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, notice that $ d - a = (k - 102) - (k - 110) = 8 $. So the difference between step and start is 8.\n\nBut still.\n\nLet’s suppose $ k = 110 $ is correct.\n\nThen sequence is $ 0, 8, 16, 24, \\dots $\n\nSo numbers congruent to 0 mod 8.\n\nThus any multiple of 8 appears.\n\nBut the question is “Which number will appear?” — singular.\n\nLikely expected answer is **8**, the common difference, or the first positive term.\n\nIn many similar problems, “counts by Xs” means the step is X, and “starting at Y”, so the numbers are Y, Y+X, Y+2X, ..., so the *step* is X, but “which number will appear” — perhaps they want X, i.e., $ k - 102 = 8 $.\n\nBut the problem says “which number will appear in Ewan's sequence?”, not “what is the common difference?”\n\n8 does appear (second term), yes.\n\n0 appears (first term).\n\nBut maybe the problem expects 8.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if 108 appears? With $ k = 110 $, sequence is multiples of 8: 108 ÷ 8 = 13.5 → no.\n\n110? 110 ÷ 8 = 13.75 → no.\n\n8 × 13 = 104, 8 × 14 = 112.\n\nSo 104, 112 appear.\n\nBut no indication.\n\nWait — perhaps I misread the definition of $ k $.\n\nProblem says:\n\n> find $ k $ equal to the sum of the digits of such an integer plus 108.\n\nSo $ k = s + 108 $. We took $ s = 2 $, $ k = 110 $.\n\nThen Ewan counts by $ (k - 102) $s → $ 110 - 102 = 8 $s.\n\nStarting at $ (k - 110) = 0 $.\n\nSo sequence: 0, 8, 16, ..., i.e., all non-negative multiples of 8.\n\nSo the set is $ \\{8m \\mid m = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\} $.\n\nThus, for example, 8 appears, 16 appears, etc.\n\nBut the question is “Which number will appear?” — perhaps it's a trick, and the answer is 0, since it's the starting point.\n\nBut let's see if other interpretations exist.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe Anna’s integer must be *positive and greater than 10*, to avoid triviality? But problem doesn’t specify.\n\nOr perhaps “integer” could be negative? But digit sum for negative numbers is usually defined as sum of digits of absolute value. But then -2 has digit sum 2, same as 2. So same $ k $.\n\nSo still $ k = 110 $.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to find a number that appears in *all possible* such sequences — intersection over all valid $ k $.\n\nWhat is intersection of all sequences $ \\{ (k - 110) + m(k - 102) \\mid m \\ge 0 \\} $ for all valid $ k $?\n\nThat seems intractable, and unlikely.\n\nGiven constraints of the problem and standard contest style, the intended path is:\n\n- Smallest digit sum satisfying conditions is 2 → $ k = 110 $\n- Then Ewan’s sequence is arithmetic with first term 0, difference 8\n- So numbers: 0, 8, 16, 24, ...\n- “Which number will appear?” — probably the smallest positive one: **8**\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the 1st term: 0.\n\nBut 0 is less likely to be the expected answer in such contexts.\n\nLet’s see if $ k = 110 $ leads to sequence containing, say, 108? No, as above.\n\nWait, $ k = 110 $, and 108 is given in problem — maybe 108 appears? 108 mod 8 = 4, not 0 → no.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps Anna’s integer is required to be *two-digit*? Let's check smallest two-digit number with prime digit sum not 3.\n\nSmallest two-digit: 10 → sum 1 → not prime  \n11 → sum 2 → prime, not multiple of 3, not square → works → same $ k = 110 $\n\nSo same.\n\nThus confident $ k = 110 $.\n\nThen Ewan’s sequence: starts at 0, step 8.\n\nSo terms: 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, ...\n\nNow, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be **8**, as the common difference and the first positive term.\n\nI think that's the most reasonable.\n\nSo answer is 8.\n\nBut let's double-check if $ n = 2 $ is acceptable.\n\n- Integer: yes  \n- Not multiple of 3: 2 mod 3 = 2 → yes  \n- Not a perfect square: squares are 0,1,4,9,... → 2 is not among them → yes  \n- Digit sum = 2 → prime → yes  \n\nAll satisfied.\n\nThus $ k = 110 $, sequence: 0, 8, 16, ... → 8 appears.\n\nHence answer is 8.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Anna's integer must satisfy three conditions: not a multiple of 3, not a perfect square, and digit sum is prime. The smallest such integer is 2, with digit sum 2 (a prime not divisible by 3, ensuring 2 is not a multiple of 3, and 2 is not a perfect square). Thus, k = digit sum + 108 = 2 + 108 = 110. Ewan's sequence counts by (k - 102) = 8, starting at (k - 110) = 0, giving the sequence 0, 8, 16, 24, ..., which includes 8 as the first positive term.\",\n    \"answer\": \"8\"\n}",
