  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-part problem. Let's parse and solve step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Part 1: Jackie’s basketball scoring\n\n> In her last basketball game, Jackie scored 36 points. These points raised the average number of points that she scored per game from 20 to 21.\n\nLet’s find how many games she had played **before** that last game.\n\nLet $ n $ = number of games before the last game.\n\nThen total points before last game = $ 20n $.\n\nAfter scoring 36 in the next (i.e., $ (n+1) $-th) game, her new average is 21:\n\n$$\n\\frac{20n + 36}{n + 1} = 21\n$$\n\nSolve:\n\n$$\n20n + 36 = 21(n + 1) = 21n + 21 \\\\\n20n + 36 = 21n + 21 \\\\\n36 - 21 = 21n - 20n \\\\\n15 = n\n$$\n\nSo she had played **15 games**, scored $ 20 \\times 15 = 300 $ points.\n\nAfter the 16th game (36 points), total = $ 300 + 36 = 336 $, average = $ 336 / 16 = 21 $. ✅\n\nNow the problem says:\n\n> To raise this average to 22 points, how many points must Jackie score in her next game? Instead of determining the score required in the subsequent game to achieve the next targeted average, simply find **total_after**, where **total_after** is the cumulative points scored upon attaining the intermediate average following the recent game.\n\nWait — let's read carefully.\n\nIt says:  \n> To raise this average to 22 points, how many points must Jackie score in her next game?  \n> **Instead of determining the score required... simply find total_after**, where total_after is the cumulative points scored upon attaining the intermediate average following the recent game.\n\nSo “intermediate average” is 22. “Following the recent game” — the recent game was the one where she scored 36 and raised average to 21. So the *next* game (i.e., 17th game) will be used to raise average to 22.\n\nSo after 17 games, average = 22 ⇒ total points = $ 22 \\times 17 = 374 $.\n\nSo **total_after = 374**.\n\nLet’s verify:\n\n- After 16 games: 336 points.\n- Let $ x $ be points in 17th game → total = $ 336 + x $, average = $ \\frac{336 + x}{17} = 22 $  \n→ $ 336 + x = 374 $ → $ x = 38 $. So she needs 38 points, and total becomes 374.\n\nThus, **total_after = 374**.\n\n✅ So we now know:  \n**total_after = 374**\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Lauren’s basketball scoring\n\n> Lauren plays basketball with her friends. She makes 10 baskets. Each of these baskets is worth either 2 or (total_after − 333) points. Lauren scores a total of 26 points. How many (total_after − 333) point baskets did she make?\n\nWe just found **total_after = 374**, so:\n\n$$\n\\text{value of special basket} = 374 - 333 = 41\n$$\n\nSo each basket is either:\n- 2 points, or  \n- 41 points.\n\nShe makes 10 baskets, total points = 26.\n\nLet $ x $ = number of 41-point baskets.  \nThen $ 10 - x $ = number of 2-point baskets.\n\nTotal points:\n\n$$\n41x + 2(10 - x) = 26 \\\\\n41x + 20 - 2x = 26 \\\\\n39x + 20 = 26 \\\\\n39x = 6 \\\\\nx = \\frac{6}{39} = \\frac{2}{13}\n$$\n\nThat’s not an integer! Something’s wrong.\n\nWait — maybe misinterpretation.\n\nLet’s double-check the problem statement:\n\n> In her last basketball game, Jackie scored 36 points. These points raised the average number of points that she scored per game from 20 to 21. To raise this average to 22 points, how many points must Jackie score in her next game? Instead of determining the score required in the subsequent game to achieve the next targeted average, simply find **total_after**, where **total_after** is the cumulative points scored upon attaining the intermediate average following the recent game.\n\n\"Intermediate average\" — is 22 the intermediate? Or is 21 the intermediate? Let's reread.\n\nOriginal average: 20  \nAfter recent game (36 pts): average becomes 21 → that’s the *intermediate* average.  \nThen \"to raise this average to 22\", i.e., go from 21 → 22, which is the *next* target.\n\nBut the sentence says:  \n> ...simply find **total_after**, where **total_after** is the cumulative points scored upon attaining the **intermediate average** following the recent game.\n\nSo perhaps “intermediate average” refers to **21**, not 22? Because 21 is intermediate between 20 and 22.\n\nLet’s test that interpretation.\n\n- “Recent game” = the one where she scored 36 and raised average from 20 to 21.  \n- So “upon attaining the intermediate average (21) following the recent game” → that would be right after that game → total points = 336.\n\nSo **total_after = 336**.\n\nThen:\n\n$ \\text{special basket value} = 336 - 333 = 3 $\n\nSo baskets are worth either 2 or 3 points.\n\nShe makes 10 baskets, total = 26.\n\nLet $ x $ = number of 3-point baskets ⇒ $ 10 - x $ = number of 2-point baskets.\n\nTotal points:\n\n$$\n3x + 2(10 - x) = 26 \\\\\n3x + 20 - 2x = 26 \\\\\nx + 20 = 26 \\\\\nx = 6\n$$\n\n✅ Integer solution.\n\nSo **6 baskets worth (total_after − 333) points**, i.e., 3-point baskets.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo which interpretation is correct?\n\nThe phrase:  \n> \"...simply find total_after, where total_after is the cumulative points scored upon attaining the **intermediate average** following the recent game.\"\n\nKey: “intermediate average” — since averages went from 20 → 21 → 22, the intermediate one is **21**, not 22.\n\nAlso, “following the recent game” — the recent game is the one that *caused* the average to become 21. So after that game, average is 21 → total is 336.\n\nAlso, the alternative (374) gave non-integer answer, which strongly suggests 336 is correct.\n\nMoreover, problem says:  \n> To raise this average to 22 points, how many points must Jackie score in her next game?  \n> Instead of determining the score required..., simply find total_after...\n\nSo they’re telling us *not* to compute the 38 points needed for next game, but rather to find the total *at the intermediate stage*, i.e., after the game that got her to 21.\n\nYes — that fits.\n\nSo **total_after = 336**\n\nThen special basket value = 336 − 333 = 3\n\nLauren makes 10 baskets, each 2 or 3 points, total 26.\n\nLet x = number of 3-point baskets.\n\nThen:\n\n3x + 2(10 − x) = 26  \n→ 3x + 20 − 2x = 26  \n→ x = 6\n\nAnswer: **6**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Jackie's average rose from 20 to 21 after scoring 36 points. Let n be games before that: (20n + 36)/(n + 1) = 21 → solving gives n = 15. So total points before = 300, after = 336. Thus total_after = 336. Then (total_after − 333) = 3. Lauren makes 10 baskets, each 2 or 3 points, totaling 26 points. Let x be number of 3-point baskets: 3x + 2(10 − x) = 26 → x = 6.\",  \n    \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
