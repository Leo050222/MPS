  "math_problem": "An electric car is charged 3 times per week for 52 weeks. The cost to charge the car each time is $0.78. What is the total cost to charge the car over these 52 weeks? Instead of computing the overall expenditure, simply find $t_c$, the total number of charging sessions over the 52 weeks. If $4x + (t_c - 142) = 8x - 48$, what is the value of $2x$?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given:\n\n- The car is charged 3 times per week.\n- This happens for 52 weeks.\n- So total number of charging sessions $ t_c = 3 \\times 52 $.\n\nCompute $ t_c $:\n\n$ 3 \\times 52 = 156 $\n\nSo $ t_c = 156 $.\n\nNow we are given the equation:\n\n$$\n4x + (t_c - 142) = 8x - 48\n$$\n\nSubstitute $ t_c = 156 $:\n\n$$\n4x + (156 - 142) = 8x - 48\n$$\n\n$$\n4x + 14 = 8x - 48\n$$\n\nSubtract $ 4x $ from both sides:\n\n$$\n14 = 4x - 48\n$$\n\nAdd 48 to both sides:\n\n$$\n62 = 4x\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{62}{4} = 15.5\n$$\n\nWe are asked for $ 2x $:\n\n$$\n2x = 2 \\times 15.5 = 31\n$$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The car is charged 3 times per week for 52 weeks, so total charging sessions t_c = 3 * 52 = 156. Substituting into the equation: 4x + (156 - 142) = 8x - 48 → 4x + 14 = 8x - 48. Solving: 14 + 48 = 8x - 4x → 62 = 4x → x = 15.5 → 2x = 31.\",\n    \"answer\": \"31\"\n}",
