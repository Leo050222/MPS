  "math_problem": "Consider the following flowchart: INPUT $\\rightarrow$ Subtract $8 \\rightarrow \\square \\rightarrow$ Divide by $2 \\rightarrow \\square$ Add $16 \\rightarrow$ OUTPUT. If the OUTPUT is 32, what was the INPUT? Instead of determining the initial input value that produces the specified output via the flowchart's sequence of operations, simply find $k = A - 26$, where $A$ is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step. What is the $y$-intercept of the line $y = x + (k - 2)$ after it is translated down $k$ units?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a flowchart:\n\nINPUT → Subtract 8 → □ → Divide by 2 → □ → Add 16 → OUTPUT = 32\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- Let INPUT = x  \n- After “Subtract 8”: x − 8 → this is the value at the **first square**, which is defined as A. So:  \n  **A = x − 8**\n\nThen next step: “Divide by 2” → (x − 8)/2 → this is the value at the **second square**.\n\nThen “Add 16” → (x − 8)/2 + 16 = OUTPUT = 32\n\nSo we can solve for x:\n\n(x − 8)/2 + 16 = 32  \n→ (x − 8)/2 = 32 − 16 = 16  \n→ x − 8 = 32  \n→ x = 40\n\nSo INPUT = 40  \nThen A = x − 8 = 40 − 8 = 32\n\nNow compute k = A − 26 = 32 − 26 = 6\n\nNow consider the line: y = x + (k − 2)  \nSince k = 6, then k − 2 = 4, so original line is:  \ny = x + 4\n\nNow it is **translated down k units**, i.e., down 6 units.  \nTranslating a graph down by k means subtract k from the y-value:  \nNew line: y = (x + 4) − 6 = x − 2\n\nThe y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0:  \ny = 0 − 2 = −2\n\nSo the y-intercept is −2.\n\nLet’s double-check all steps:\n\n- OUTPUT = 32  \n- Working backwards: before “Add 16”, value was 32 − 16 = 16  \n- Before “Divide by 2”, value was 16 × 2 = 32  \n- That 32 is A (since A is after subtract 8), so A = 32  \n- Then k = A − 26 = 6  \n- Line: y = x + (6 − 2) = x + 4  \n- Translate down 6: y = x + 4 − 6 = x − 2  \n- y-intercept = −2 ✅\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given OUTPUT = 32. Working backward through the flowchart: before 'Add 16' is 32 − 16 = 16; before 'Divide by 2' is 16 × 2 = 32; this value is A, the intermediate at the first square (after subtracting 8). So A = 32. Then k = A − 26 = 6. The line is y = x + (k − 2) = x + 4. Translating down k = 6 units gives y = x + 4 − 6 = x − 2. The y-intercept is the value when x = 0, which is −2.\",  \n    \"answer\": \"-2\"\n}",
