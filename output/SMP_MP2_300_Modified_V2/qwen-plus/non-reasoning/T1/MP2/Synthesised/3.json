  "math_problem": "If $x$ and $y$ are positive integers with $x+y=31$, what is the largest possible value of $x y$? Instead of finding the largest possible value of the product $x y$, simply find $k$, which is that largest value minus 231. If a line segment joins the points $(-k,-(k - 7))$ and $((k - 3),(k - 1))$, how many points on the line segment have coordinates that are both integers?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given:\n\n- $ x $ and $ y $ are **positive integers**, with $ x + y = 31 $\n- We want the **largest possible value of $ xy $**\n- Let $ k = \\text{max}(xy) - 231 $\n- Then consider the line segment joining points:\n  - $ A = (-k, -(k - 7)) = (-k, -k + 7) $\n  - $ B = (k - 3, k - 1) $\n- Find how many **lattice points** (points with integer coordinates) lie **on the segment AB**, including endpoints.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Maximize $ xy $ given $ x + y = 31 $, $ x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ $\n\nFor fixed sum, product $ xy $ is maximized when $ x $ and $ y $ are as close as possible.\n\nSince $ x + y = 31 $, the pair closest to each other is $ x = 15, y = 16 $ or vice versa.\n\nCheck:\n- $ 15 \\times 16 = 240 $\n- $ 14 \\times 17 = 238 $\n- $ 13 \\times 18 = 234 $\n- $ 12 \\times 19 = 228 $\nSo yes, max is $ 240 $.\n\nThus,\n$$\nk = 240 - 231 = 9\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Coordinates of endpoints with $ k = 9 $\n\n- Point A: $ (-k, -(k - 7)) = (-9, -(9 - 7)) = (-9, -2) $\n- Point B: $ (k - 3, k - 1) = (9 - 3, 9 - 1) = (6, 8) $\n\nSo segment from $ A = (-9, -2) $ to $ B = (6, 8) $\n\nWe need number of **lattice points on the segment**, including endpoints.\n\nStandard formula: For a line segment between two lattice points $ (x_1, y_1) $ and $ (x_2, y_2) $, the number of lattice points on it (including endpoints) is:\n\n$$\n\\gcd(|x_2 - x_1|, |y_2 - y_1|) + 1\n$$\n\nCompute differences:\n\n- $ \\Delta x = 6 - (-9) = 15 $\n- $ \\Delta y = 8 - (-2) = 10 $\n\nSo $ \\gcd(15, 10) = 5 $\n\nTherefore, number of lattice points = $ 5 + 1 = 6 $\n\n✅ Let's verify quickly:\n\nThe direction vector is $ (15, 10) $, which simplifies to $ (3, 2) $ after dividing by gcd = 5.\n\nSo parametric form: starting at $ (-9, -2) $, add $ t \\cdot (3, 2) $ for $ t = 0 $ to $ 5 $:\n\n- $ t = 0 $: $ (-9, -2) $\n- $ t = 1 $: $ (-6, 0) $\n- $ t = 2 $: $ (-3, 2) $\n- $ t = 3 $: $ (0, 4) $\n- $ t = 4 $: $ (3, 6) $\n- $ t = 5 $: $ (6, 8) $\n\nAll integer coordinates — 6 points. Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Given x + y = 31 with x, y positive integers, the product xy is maximized when x and y are as close as possible: x = 15, y = 16 gives xy = 240. So k = 240 - 231 = 9. The endpoints become A = (-9, -2) and B = (6, 8). The differences are Δx = 15, Δy = 10, and gcd(15, 10) = 5. The number of lattice points on the segment is gcd + 1 = 6.\",  \n    \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
