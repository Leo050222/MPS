  "math_problem": "Solve for $2d$ if $10d + 8 = 528$. Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance $s$ equal to that solution plus 48. Megan and Hana raced their remote control cars for $s$ m. The two cars started at the same time. The average speed of Megan's car was $\\frac{5}{4} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Hana's car finished $(s - 95)$ seconds before Megan's car. What was the average speed of Hana's car?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-step problem. Let's break it down carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Solve for $ d $ from the equation  \n$$\n10d + 8 = 528\n$$\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n$$\n10d = 520\n$$\n\nDivide by 10:\n\n$$\nd = 52\n$$\n\nThen $ 2d = 104 $, but the problem says:  \n> \"Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance $ s $ equal to that solution plus 48.\"\n\nSo \"that solution\" refers to $ d = 52 $, not $ 2d $. So:\n\n$$\ns = d + 48 = 52 + 48 = 100\n$$\n\nSo the race distance is $ s = 100 $ meters.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use race information to find Hana’s average speed.\n\n- Distance: $ s = 100 $ m  \n- Megan’s average speed: $ \\frac{5}{4} $ m/s = $ 1.25 $ m/s  \n- Time Megan takes:  \n  $$\n  t_M = \\frac{s}{v_M} = \\frac{100}{\\frac{5}{4}} = 100 \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} = 80 \\text{ seconds}\n  $$\n\n- Hana finishes $ s - 95 = 100 - 95 = 5 $ seconds **before** Megan.  \n  So Hana’s time:  \n  $$\n  t_H = t_M - 5 = 80 - 5 = 75 \\text{ seconds}\n  $$\n\n- Therefore, Hana’s average speed is:\n  $$\n  v_H = \\frac{s}{t_H} = \\frac{100}{75} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ m/s}\n  $$\n\nSimplify: $ \\frac{100}{75} = \\frac{4}{3} $\n\nSo answer is $ \\frac{4}{3} $, or as a decimal 1.333..., but exact fraction is preferred.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer Format:\n\nWe must output in JSON with reasoning and answer.\n\nAnswer is $ \\frac{4}{3} $ — but check if they want it as a fraction string or decimal? The problem says “exact value”, and $ \\frac{4}{3} $ is exact. Since no instruction to convert to decimal, and it's standard to keep fractions, we'll use `\"4/3\"` as the answer string.\n\nBut wait — let's double-check all steps.\n\n- $ 10d + 8 = 528 \\Rightarrow d = 52 $ ✔  \n- $ s = d + 48 = 100 $ ✔  \n- Megan’s speed = $ \\frac{5}{4} $ m/s → time = $ \\frac{100}{5/4} = 80 $ s ✔  \n- Hana finishes $ s - 95 = 5 $ seconds earlier → time = 75 s ✔  \n- Speed = $ \\frac{100}{75} = \\frac{4}{3} $ ✔  \n\nYes.\n\nSo final answer is $ \\frac{4}{3} $, written as `\"4/3\"`.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"From 10d + 8 = 528, solve: 10d = 520 → d = 52. Then s = d + 48 = 52 + 48 = 100 meters. Megan's speed is 5/4 m/s, so her time is 100 / (5/4) = 80 seconds. Hana finishes (s - 95) = 5 seconds earlier, so her time is 75 seconds. Thus, Hana's average speed is 100 / 75 = 4/3 m/s.\",  \n    \"answer\": \"4/3\"\n}",
