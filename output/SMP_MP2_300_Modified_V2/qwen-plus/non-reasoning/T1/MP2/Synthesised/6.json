  "math_problem": "The surface area of a cube is 24. What is the volume of the cube? Instead of determining the volume of the cube, simply find $a$, where $a$ is the length of an edge of the cube. One integer is selected at random from the following list of 15 integers: $1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5$. The probability that the selected integer is equal to $n$ is $a - \\frac{5}{3}$. What is the value of $n$?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-step problem. Let's break it down carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Surface area of a cube is 24 → find edge length $ a $\n\nA cube has 6 faces, each a square of side length $ a $. So surface area is:\n\n$$\n6a^2 = 24\n$$\n\nSolve for $ a $:\n\n$$\na^2 = \\frac{24}{6} = 4 \\Rightarrow a = \\sqrt{4} = 2\n$$\n\nSo $ a = 2 $. (We only need the edge length, not volume.)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: A list of 15 integers:\n\n$$\n1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5\n$$\n\nLet’s count frequencies:\n\n- 1 appears **1** time  \n- 2 appears **2** times  \n- 3 appears **3** times  \n- 4 appears **4** times  \n- 5 appears **5** times  \n\nIndeed, $1+2+3+4+5 = 15$, matches.\n\nSo probability that selected integer equals $ n $ is:\n\n$$\nP(n) = \\frac{\\text{frequency of } n}{15}\n$$\n\nWe’re told:\n\n$$\nP(n) = a - \\frac{5}{3}\n$$\n\nWe found $ a = 2 $, so:\n\n$$\na - \\frac{5}{3} = 2 - \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{6}{3} - \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nP(n) = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\nNow find $ n $ such that its frequency divided by 15 equals $ \\frac{1}{3} $:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{freq}(n)}{15} = \\frac{1}{3} \\Rightarrow \\text{freq}(n) = \\frac{15}{3} = 5\n$$\n\nWhich number appears **5 times**? From above: **5** appears 5 times.\n\nSo $ n = 5 $\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The surface area of a cube is 6a² = 24 ⇒ a² = 4 ⇒ a = 2. Then a − 5/3 = 2 − 5/3 = 1/3. The probability that the selected integer equals n is freq(n)/15 = 1/3 ⇒ freq(n) = 5. In the list, only the integer 5 appears 5 times. Therefore, n = 5.\",  \n    \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
