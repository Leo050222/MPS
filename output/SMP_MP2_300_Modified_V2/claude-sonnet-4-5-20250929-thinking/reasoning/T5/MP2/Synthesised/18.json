  "math_problem": "The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers and takes non-negative integer values. $f(2)=0,f(3)>0,f(9999)=3333$ and for all $m,n:$ \\[ f(m+n)-f(m)-f(n)=0 \\text{ or } 1. \\] Determine $f(1982)$. Instead of determining the value attained by the function at 1982, simply find $k = f(3) + 1$, where $f(3)$ is the positive integer value attained by the function at 3. Consider $(k + 7)$ points in space, no four of which are coplanar. Each pair of points is joined by an edge (that is, a line segment) and each edge is either colored with one of $k$ colors or left uncolored. Find the smallest value of $\\,n\\,$ such that whenever exactly $\\,n\\,$ edges are colored, the set of colored edges necessarily contains a triangle all of whose edges have the same color.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve two parts: first find $f(3)$ and then $k$, and then solve the graph coloring problem.\n\n## Part 1: Finding f(3) and k\n\nGiven:\n- $f(2) = 0$\n- $f(3) > 0$  \n- $f(9999) = 3333$\n- $f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ for all $m, n$\n\n**Finding f(1):**\nSetting $m = n = 1$:\n$$f(2) - f(1) - f(1) = 0 \\text{ or } 1$$\n$$0 - 2f(1) = 0 \\text{ or } 1$$\n\nSince $f(1)$ must be a non-negative integer, only $f(1) = 0$ works.\n\n**Finding f(3):**\nSetting $m = 1, n = 2$:\n$$f(3) - f(1) - f(2) = 0 \\text{ or } 1$$\n$$f(3) - 0 - 0 = 0 \\text{ or } 1$$\n\nSince $f(3) > 0$, we have $f(3) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, $k = f(3) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n**Verification:** The function $f(n) = \\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor$ satisfies all conditions:\n- $f(1) = 0$, $f(2) = 0$, $f(3) = 1$, $f(9999) = 3333$ ✓\n- The functional equation holds because $\\lfloor (m+n)/3 \\rfloor - \\lfloor m/3 \\rfloor - \\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ ✓\n\n## Part 2: Graph Coloring Problem\n\nWe have:\n- $(k + 7) = 2 + 7 = 9$ points in space\n- Total edges: $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ edges\n- Colors available: $k = 2$ colors\n- Find minimum $n$ such that coloring exactly $n$ edges necessarily creates a monochromatic triangle\n\n**Key observations:**\n\n1. By Ramsey's theorem, $R(3,3) = 6$, meaning any 2-coloring of $K_6$ (complete graph on 6 vertices) contains a monochromatic triangle.\n\n2. By Turán's theorem, the maximum number of edges in a graph on 9 vertices without containing $K_6$ as a subgraph is $t(9, 5)$.\n\n3. The Turán graph $T(9, 5)$ is a complete 5-partite graph with parts of sizes 2, 2, 2, 2, 1.\n\n4. Number of edges in $T(9, 5)$:\n$$t(9, 5) = \\binom{9}{2} - \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\binom{|V_i|}{2} = 36 - (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0) = 32$$\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIf we color at most 32 edges, we might be able to choose them such that they don't form a $K_6$ subgraph, and thus we might avoid having a monochromatic triangle.\n\nHowever, if we color at least 33 edges, then by Turán's theorem, the colored subgraph must contain $K_6$. Since all 15 edges of this $K_6$ are colored with 2 colors, by Ramsey's theorem $R(3,3) = 6$, there must exist a monochromatic triangle.\n\nTherefore, the smallest value of $n$ is **33**.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I determined that f(1) = 0 by setting m = n = 1 in the functional equation. Then f(3) = 1 since f(3) - f(1) - f(2) = 0 or 1, and f(3) > 0. Thus k = f(3) + 1 = 2. For the graph problem with 9 vertices and 2 colors: By Ramsey's theorem R(3,3) = 6, any 2-coloring of K_6 has a monochromatic triangle. By Turán's theorem, t(9,5) = 32 is the maximum edges without K_6. Therefore, with 33 or more colored edges, we must have K_6 as a subgraph, guaranteeing a monochromatic triangle.\",\n    \"answer\": \"33\"\n}",
