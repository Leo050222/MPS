Determine all positive integers relatively prime to all the terms of the infinite sequence $a_n=2^n+3^n+6^n -d$, $n\\geq d$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to first find $f(1) = d$ by analyzing the functional equation, then determine which positive integers are relatively prime to all terms in the sequence.\n\n## Finding $d = f(1)$\n\nGiven: $f(xf(y)+y^3)=yf(x)+f(y)^3$\n\n**Finding $f(0)$:**\n\nSetting $x = y = 0$:\n$$f(0) = f(0)^3$$\n$$f(0)(f(0)^2 - 1) = 0$$\n\nSo $f(0) \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\nTesting each case:\n- If $f(0) = 1$: Setting $x = x, y = 0$ gives $f(x) = 1$ for all $x$. Checking the original equation: $1 = y + 1$ for all $y$, which is false.\n- If $f(0) = -1$: Setting $x = x, y = 0$ gives $f(-x) = -1$ for all $x$, making $f$ constant at $-1$. This doesn't satisfy the equation.\n- If $f(0) = 0$: This is consistent.\n\n**With $f(0) = 0$:**\n\nSetting $y = 1$ in the functional equation:\n$$f(xf(1) + 1) = f(x) + f(1)^3$$\n\nLet $c = f(1)$. Then:\n$$f(xc + 1) = f(x) + c^3$$\n\nSetting $x = 0$:\n$$f(1) = f(0) + c^3$$\n$$c = 0 + c^3$$\n$$c(c^2 - 1) = 0$$\n\nSo $c \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n**Testing solutions:**\n- $c = 0 \\Rightarrow f(x) = 0$: Check: $f(0) = 0 = 0 + 0$. ✓\n- $c = 1 \\Rightarrow f(x) = x$: Check: $f(xy + y^3) = xy + y^3 = yx + y^3$. ✓\n- $c = -1$: Testing $f(x) = -x$ fails the original equation.\n\nThe non-trivial solution is $f(x) = x$, giving $\\boxed{d = 1}$.\n\n## Finding positive integers relatively prime to all $a_n$\n\nWith $d = 1$, for $n \\geq 1$:\n$$a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1$$\n\nComputing initial terms:\n- $a_1 = 2 + 3 + 6 - 1 = 10 = 2 \\cdot 5$\n- $a_2 = 4 + 9 + 36 - 1 = 48 = 2^4 \\cdot 3$\n- $a_3 = 8 + 27 + 216 - 1 = 250 = 2 \\cdot 5^3$\n\n**Finding which primes divide all $a_n$:**\n\nA prime $p$ divides all $a_n$ if and only if $2^n + 3^n + 6^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\nFor $n = 1$: $2 + 3 + 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ gives $p \\mid 10$, so $p \\in \\{2, 5\\}$.\n\nChecking $p = 2$:\n$$2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 \\equiv 0 + 1 + 0 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$$ for all $n \\geq 1$. ✓\n\nChecking $p = 5$:\n- $a_1 = 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ ✓\n- $a_2 = 48 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$ ✗\n\nTherefore, $\\gcd(a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots) = 2$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA positive integer $m$ is relatively prime to all $a_n$ if and only if $\\gcd(m, 2) = 1$, which means $m$ must be odd.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I solved the functional equation f(xf(y)+y³)=yf(x)+f(y)³. By setting specific values, I found f(0)=0 and f(1)=c where c(c²-1)=0. Testing solutions shows f(x)=x works, giving d=1. For the sequence aₙ=2ⁿ+3ⁿ+6ⁿ-1 (n≥1), I computed: a₁=10, a₂=48, a₃=250. A prime p divides all aₙ only if it divides a₁=10, so p∈{2,5}. Checking: 2 divides all aₙ (since 2ⁿ+3ⁿ+6ⁿ-1 is always even), but 5 doesn't divide a₂=48. Thus gcd(a₁,a₂,...)=2. A positive integer m is relatively prime to all aₙ iff gcd(m,2)=1, meaning m is odd.\",\n    \"answer\": \"all odd positive integers\"\n}",
