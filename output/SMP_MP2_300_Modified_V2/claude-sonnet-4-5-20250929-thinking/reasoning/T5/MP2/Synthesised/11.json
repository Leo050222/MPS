  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to work through two connected parts.\n\n## Part 1: Finding α\n\nFor the first part, I need to find the value α = P(1) for the extremal cubic polynomial.\n\nThe extremal polynomial that maximizes ∫₀¹|P(x)|dx subject to max|P(x)| = 1 on [0,1] and having a root in [0,1] is related to Chebyshev polynomials.\n\nThe Chebyshev polynomial of degree 3 on [-1,1] is:\n$$T_3(t) = 4t^3 - 3t$$\n\nThis has roots at t = 0, ±√3/2 and oscillates between -1 and 1.\n\nTo transform to [0,1], I use the substitution t = 2x - 1:\n$$P(x) = T_3(2x-1) = 4(2x-1)^3 - 3(2x-1)$$\n\nLet me verify:\n- At x = 1/2: t = 0, so P(1/2) = T_3(0) = 0 ✓ (root in [0,1])\n- At x = 1: P(1) = T_3(1) = 4(1)³ - 3(1) = 1\n\nTherefore, **α = 1**.\n\n## Part 2: Finding other solutions\n\nNow with α = 1, the condition becomes:\n$$p(1/k) = k^2 \\text{ for all integers } k \\text{ with } 1 ≤ |k| ≤ n$$\n\nThis gives us:\n- p(1/k) = k² for k = 1, 2, ..., n\n- p(-1/k) = k² for k = 1, 2, ..., n\n\nSince p(1/k) = p(-1/k) for all these values, this suggests p is an even function: p(x) = p(-x).\n\nFor an even polynomial of degree 2n, I can write:\n$$p(x) = q(x²)$$\n\nwhere q is a polynomial of degree n.\n\nSubstituting y = x²:\n$$q(1/k²) = k²$$ for k = 1, 2, ..., n\n\nThis means q(1/k²) = 1/(1/k²), so:\n$$q(1/k²) · (1/k²) = 1$$\n\nDefine r(y) = y·q(y) - 1. Then r(y) is a polynomial of degree n+1 with roots at y = 1/k² for k = 1, 2, ..., n.\n\nSince r has degree n+1 and we've found n roots, there's one more root y_{n+1}.\n\nSince r(y) = y·q(y) - 1, we have r(0) = 0·q(0) - 1 = -1.\n\nWe can write:\n$$r(y) = (y - 1)(y - 1/4)···(y - 1/n²)(y - y_{n+1})$$\n\nEvaluating at y = 0:\n$$r(0) = (-1)(-1/4)···(-1/n²)(-y_{n+1}) = (-1)^{n+1} · \\frac{y_{n+1}}{(n!)²} = -1$$\n\nSince n is even (given), (-1)^{n+1} = -1, so:\n$$\\frac{y_{n+1}}{(n!)²} = 1$$\n$$y_{n+1} = (n!)²$$\n\nNow, we want all x such that p(1/x) = x².\n\nSince p(x) = q(x²), we have p(1/x) = q(1/x²).\n\nThe condition p(1/x) = x² becomes:\n$$q(1/x²) = x²$$\n\nThis requires q(y) = 1/y where y = 1/x², which means r(y) = 0.\n\nThe roots of r(y) = 0 are: y ∈ {1, 1/4, 1/9, ..., 1/n², (n!)²}\n\nSo 1/x² ∈ {1, 1/4, 1/9, ..., 1/n², (n!)²}\n\nThis gives x² ∈ {1, 4, 9, ..., n², 1/(n!)²}\n\nTherefore: x ∈ {±1, ±2, ±3, ..., ±n, ±1/n!}\n\nThe values x = ±1, ±2, ..., ±n are already given in the problem. The \"other\" real numbers are:\n\n$$x = ±\\frac{1}{n!}$$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The extremal cubic polynomial is related to the Chebyshev polynomial T_3 transformed to [0,1], giving α = 1. With this value, the polynomial p(x) must be even, expressible as q(x²). The condition p(1/x) = x² leads to finding roots of r(y) = y·q(y) - 1, which has n known roots at y = 1/k² for k = 1,...,n and one additional root at y = (n!)². This corresponds to x² = 1/(n!)², giving the additional solutions.\",\n    \"answer\": \"±1/n!\"\n}",
