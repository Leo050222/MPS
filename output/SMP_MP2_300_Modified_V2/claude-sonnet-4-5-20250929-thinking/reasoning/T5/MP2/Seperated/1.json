  "reasoning_content": "Looking at both problems systematically:\n\n## Problem 1: Finding f(1)\n\nGiven: $f(xf(y)+y^3)=yf(x)+f(y)^3$\n\n**Step 1:** Find $f(0)$ using $P(0,0)$:\n$$f(0 \\cdot f(0) + 0) = 0 \\cdot f(0) + f(0)^3$$\n$$f(0) = f(0)^3$$\nSo $f(0) \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$\n\nTesting $f(0) = 1$ and $f(0) = -1$ with $P(x,0)$ leads to contradictions, so $f(0) = 0$.\n\n**Step 2:** From $P(0,y)$:\n$$f(y^3) = f(y)^3$$\n\n**Step 3:** From $P(x,1)$:\n$$f(xf(1) + 1) = f(x) + f(1)^3$$\n\nLet $c = f(1)$. Then $f(cx + 1) = f(x) + c^3$.\n\n**Step 4:** Setting $x=0$ in the above:\n$$f(1) = f(0) + c^3 = c^3$$\nSo $c = c^3$, giving $c \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$\n\n**Step 5:** Testing $c = -1$:\nFrom $f(-x+1) = f(x) - 1$, setting $x=0$: $f(1) = f(0) - 1 = -1$ ✓\nSetting $x=1$: $f(0) = f(1) - 1 = -2$ ✗ (contradiction with $f(0) = 0$)\n\nSo $c = -1$ doesn't work.\n\n**Step 6:** The valid solutions are:\n- $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$ (giving $f(1) = 0$)\n- $f(x) = x$ for all $x$ (giving $f(1) = 1$)\n\nVerification that $f(x) = x$ works:\n$$f(xf(y) + y^3) = xy + y^3 = yf(x) + f(y)^3$$ ✓\n\nThe non-trivial solution gives $f(1) = 1$.\n\n## Problem 2: Finding integers relatively prime to all $a_n$\n\nGiven: $a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1$ for $n \\geq 1$\n\n**Computing first few terms:**\n- $a_1 = 2 + 3 + 6 - 1 = 10 = 2 \\cdot 5$\n- $a_2 = 4 + 9 + 36 - 1 = 48 = 2^4 \\cdot 3$\n- $a_3 = 8 + 27 + 216 - 1 = 250 = 2 \\cdot 5^3$\n\n**Checking divisibility by small primes:**\n\n**Modulo 2:** $a_n \\equiv 0 + 1 + 0 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$ for all $n$.\n\n**Modulo 3:** $a_n \\equiv 2^n - 1 \\pmod{3}$\n- For even $n$: $a_n \\equiv 1 - 1 = 0 \\pmod{3}$\n\n**Modulo 5:** $a_1 = 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$\n\n**Modulo 7:** Computing $a_5$:\n- $2^5 = 32 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$\n- $3^5 = 243 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$  \n- $6^5 \\equiv (-1)^5 = -1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$\n- $a_5 \\equiv 4 + 5 + 6 - 1 = 14 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n\n**General argument:** For any prime $p$, we can find some $n$ such that $p | a_n$. This has been verified for small primes. For instance, checking modulo 11:\n- Computing through values shows $a_8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$\n\nSince every prime divides at least one term in the sequence, any integer $d > 1$ will have a prime factor that divides some $a_n$, meaning $\\gcd(d, a_n) > 1$ for that $n$.\n\nTherefore, only $d = 1$ is relatively prime to all terms.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Testing the functional equation at specific points shows f(0)=0, and f(1) satisfies f(1)=f(1)^3, giving f(1) in {0,1,-1}. Testing shows only f(1)=0 (trivial) and f(1)=1 (for f(x)=x) work. The non-trivial solution gives f(1)=1. For Problem 2: Computing a_n modulo small primes shows that 2|a_n for all n, 3|a_n for even n, 5|a_1, 7|a_5, 11|a_8, etc. Every prime divides at least one term, so only 1 is relatively prime to all terms.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}\n```",
