  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems, I'll solve them step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nWe need to find all functions $f:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all positive integers $m$ and $n$:\n- $f(m)+f(n)-mn \\neq 0$\n- $(f(m)+f(n)-mn) \\mid (mf(m)+nf(n))$\n\n**Finding f(1):**\n\nLet $m = n = 1$:\n- $(f(1)+f(1)-1) \\mid (f(1)+f(1))$\n- $(2f(1)-1) \\mid 2f(1)$\n\nSince $(2f(1)-1) \\mid 2f(1)$, we also have:\n$(2f(1)-1) \\mid [2f(1) - (2f(1)-1)] = 1$\n\nTherefore, $2f(1)-1 = \\pm 1$.\n\nSince $f(1) \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $2f(1) - 1 \\geq 1$, so $2f(1) - 1 = 1$.\n\nThis gives us $f(1) = 1$.\n\n**Verification that f(n) = n² works:**\n\nWith $f(n) = n^2$, we need to verify:\n$(m^2+n^2-mn) \\mid (m^3+n^3)$\n\nWe know that $m^3+n^3 = (m+n)(m^2-mn+n^2)$.\n\nSo we need $(m^2+n^2-mn) \\mid (m+n)(m^2-mn+n^2)$.\n\nSince $m^2+n^2-mn = m^2-mn+n^2$, we have:\n$(m^2-mn+n^2) \\mid (m+n)(m^2-mn+n^2)$\n\nThis is always true, confirming $f(n) = n^2$ is a solution.\n\nTherefore, $k = f(1) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nWe have the functional equation:\n$(x^3 - mx^2 +1) P(x+1) + (x^3+mx^2+1) P(x-1) = 2(x^3 - mx +1) P(x)$\n\n**Testing P(x) = x:**\n\nLHS for $P(x) = x$:\n- $(x^3 - mx^2 +1)(x+1) = x^4 + (1-m)x^3 - mx^2 + x + 1$\n- $(x^3+mx^2+1)(x-1) = x^4 + (m-1)x^3 - mx^2 + x - 1$\n- Sum: $2x^4 - 2mx^2 + 2x$\n\nRHS for $P(x) = x$:\n- $2(x^3 - mx +1) x = 2x^4 - 2mx^2 + 2x$\n\nLHS = RHS ✓\n\n**Testing P(x) = cx (for any constant c):**\n\nBy linearity, if $P(x) = x$ is a solution, then $P(x) = cx$ is also a solution for any real constant $c$.\n\n**Testing other forms:**\n\nFor $P(x) = 1$:\n- LHS: $2x^3 + 2$\n- RHS: $2x^3 - 2mx + 2$\n\nThese don't match for general $x$ (unless $m = 0$, which is excluded).\n\nFor $P(x) = x^2$: Similar analysis shows this doesn't work for general $m$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe solutions are $P(x) = cx$ where $c$ is any real constant. This includes $P(x) = 0$ when $c = 0$.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Setting m=n=1 gives (2f(1)-1)|2f(1), which implies (2f(1)-1)|1, so f(1)=1.
