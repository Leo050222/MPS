  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems, I'll solve them step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Finding the Monic Polynomial\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing the condition**\n\nWe need $p | 2(f(p)!) + 1$, which means $2(f(p)!) \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nBy Wilson's theorem: $(p-1)! \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for any prime $p$.\n\n**Step 2: Determining the degree**\n\nIf $f$ has degree $n \\geq 2$, then for large primes $p$, we have $f(p) > p$. This means $p | f(p)!$, so $p | 2f(p)!$, making it impossible for $p | 2f(p)! + 1$.\n\nTherefore, $f$ must be linear: $f(x) = x + a_0$.\n\n**Step 3: Finding the constant term**\n\nIf $a_0 \\geq 0$, then $f(p) \\geq p$, giving the same contradiction.\n\nSo $a_0 = -c$ where $c > 0$, meaning $f(x) = x - c$ and $f(p) = p - c$.\n\nUsing Wilson's theorem:\n$(p-1)! = (p-c)! \\cdot (p-c+1) \\cdots (p-1) \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$\n\nThe product $(p-c+1) \\cdots (p-1) \\equiv (-c+1) \\cdots (-1) \\equiv (-1)^{c-1}(c-1)! \\pmod{p}$\n\nTherefore: $(p-c)! \\equiv \\frac{(-1)^c}{(c-1)!} \\pmod{p}$\n\n**Step 4: Applying the condition**\n\nWe need: $2(p-c)! \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$\n\nThis gives: $2(-1)^c \\equiv -(c-1)! \\pmod{p}$\n\nFor this to hold for all large primes $p$, we need: $2(-1)^c = -(c-1)!$\n\n- If $c$ is even: $2 = -(c-1)!$, which is impossible.\n- If $c$ is odd: $-2 = -(c-1)!$, so $(c-1)! = 2$.\n\nSince $(c-1)! = 2$, we have $c-1 = 2$, so $c = 3$.\n\n**Step 5: Verification**\n\nFor $f(x) = x - 3$ and prime $p > 3$:\n$(p-1)! = (p-3)! \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\equiv (p-3)! \\cdot (-2) \\cdot (-1) = 2(p-3)! \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ ✓\n\n**Step 6: Finding d**\n\nThe unique linear monic polynomial is $f(x) = x - 3$.\n- Constant term: $-3$\n- $k = |-3| = 3$\n- $d = k - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1$\n\n## Problem 2: Existence of Function\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing uniqueness of preimages**\n\nFor $y \\neq 0$, if $f(x_1) = f(x_2) = y$, then from $f(y) = (x_1-1)y + 2 = (x_2-1)y + 2$:\n$(x_1 - x_2)y = 0$\n\nSince $x_1 \\neq x_2$ would require $y = 0$, each $y \\neq 0$ has exactly one preimage.\n\n**Step 2: Finding $f(0)$**\n\nLet $f(a) = 0$ for some $a$. Then:\n$f(0) = f(f(a)) = (a-1) \\cdot 0 + 2 = 2$\n\n**Step 3: Finding more values**\n\nSince $f(0) = 2 \\neq 0$, the unique preimage of 2 is 0.\n\nFor the unique $x$ with $f(x) = 2$, we have $x = 0$. Using the functional equation:\n$f(2) = (0-1) \\cdot 2 + 2 = 0$\n\nSo $f(2) = 0$ and since 0 has a unique preimage, $a = 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Checking $f(1)$**\n\nLet $f(c) = 1$. Then $f(1) = c + 1$.\n\nIf $c \\neq -1$, then $c + 1 \\neq 0$ has unique preimage 1. Therefore:\n$f(c+1) = (1-1)(c+1) + 2 = 2$\n\nBut 2 has unique preimage 0, so $c + 1 = 0$, giving $c = -1$.\n\nThus $f(-1) = 1$ and $f(1) = 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Finding the contradiction**\n\nWe now have both $f(1) = 0$ and $f(2) = 0$, but 0 should have exactly one preimage. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, **no such function exists**.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I analyzed the condition using Wilson's theorem to determine that f must be linear with f(x) = x - 3.
