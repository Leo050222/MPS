Find all possible values of $x$. Instead of determining all possible real roots of the quartic equation with coefficients given by the side lengths, simply find $k = b + 2013$, where $b$ is the length of side $CA$. Find the numbers of ordered array $(x_1,...,x_{100})$ that satisfies the following conditions: $(i)$ $x_1,...,x_{100} \\in \\{1,2,..,k\\}$; $(ii)$ $k | x_1 + \\dots + x_{100}$; $(iii)$ $k | x_1^2 + \\dots + x_{100}^2$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to first determine the value of $b = CA$, then use it to find $k = b + 2013$, and finally count the ordered arrays.\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing the Polynomial Structure\n\nThe equation $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + 1 = 0$ has a special structure: the coefficients are symmetric-like (1, a, b, c, 1).\n\nIf I substitute $\\frac{1}{x}$ into the equation and multiply by $x^4$:\n$$1 + ax + bx^2 + cx^3 + x^4 = 0$$\n$$x^4 + cx^3 + bx^2 + ax + 1 = 0$$\n\nFor this to match the original equation, we need $a = c$, meaning $BC = AB$.\n\n## Step 2: Properties of the Triangle\n\nSince $AB = BC$ and the triangle is inscribed in a circle of radius 2 with $\\angle ABC \\geq 90°$:\n- The triangle is isosceles with $\\angle BAC = \\angle BCA$\n- By the extended law of sines: $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C} = 2R = 4$\n\nFor a triangle inscribed in a circle, when $\\angle ABC = 90°$ exactly:\n- The side $AC$ (opposite to the right angle) is a diameter\n- Therefore $b = CA = 2R = 2(2) = 4$\n\n## Step 3: Verification with $\\angle B = 90°$\n\nWhen $\\angle B = 90°$ and $AB = BC$:\n- This is a right isosceles triangle\n- The hypotenuse $AC$ is the diameter: $AC = 4$\n- So $b = 4$\n\nTherefore: $k = b + 2013 = 4 + 2013 = 2017$\n\nNote: 2017 is a prime number.\n\n## Step 4: Counting the Ordered Arrays\n\nWe need to count ordered arrays $(x_1, ..., x_{100})$ where:\n- Each $x_i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 2017\\}$\n- $2017 | (x_1 + ... + x_{100})$\n- $2017 | (x_1^2 + ... + x_{100}^2)$\n\nLet $s = \\sum_{i=1}^{99} x_i$ and $t = \\sum_{i=1}^{99} x_i^2$.\n\nFor any choice of $x_1, ..., x_{99}$, we need:\n- $x_{100} \\equiv -s \\pmod{2017}$ (from the first condition)\n- $x_{100}^2 \\equiv -t \\pmod{2017}$ (from the second condition)\n\nThe first condition uniquely determines $x_{100}$ modulo 2017. For consistency with the second condition:\n$$(-s)^2 \\equiv -t \\pmod{2017}$$\n$$s^2 + t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$$\n\nSo we need to count tuples $(x_1, ..., x_{99})$ such that $s^2 + t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$.\n\nThe constraint $t \\equiv -s^2 \\pmod{2017}$ defines a functional relationship: for each value of $s$ modulo 2017, there's exactly one value of $t$ modulo 2017 that satisfies the constraint.\n\nBy symmetry and uniformity arguments over the finite field $\\mathbb{Z}/2017\\mathbb{Z}$:\n- There are $2017^{99}$ total choices for $(x_1, ..., x_{99})$\n- The pairs $(s \\bmod 2017, t \\bmod 2017)$ are distributed approximately uniformly over $2017^2$ possibilities\n- The constraint $s^2 + t \\equiv 0$ selects $2017$ out of $2017^2$ possibilities (one for each value of $s$)\n\nTherefore, the number of valid tuples is:\n$$N = \\frac{2017^{99}}{2017} = 2017^{98}$$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I determined that the polynomial structure requires BC = AB (isosceles triangle). For a triangle inscribed in a circle of radius 2 with angle B ≥ 90°, when angle B = 90°, side CA = 4 (diameter). Thus k = 4 + 2013 = 2017. For counting arrays: the conditions require x_100 ≡ -s (mod 2017) and x_100² ≡ -t (mod 2017), which are consistent when s² + t ≡ 0 (mod 2017). This constraint selects 2017 out of 2017² possibilities in the (s,t) space, giving 2017^99/2017 = 2017^98 valid arrays.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2017^98\"\n}",
