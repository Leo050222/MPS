Instead of determining all such pairs of monic complex polynomials satisfying the given divisibility conditions, simply find $k = T + 14$, where $T$ is the constant satisfying $P^{2} + Q^{2} + 1 = P Q T$ for pairs $P, Q$ meeting the conditions. $k$ students took part in a competition. All problems were multiple choice style. Each problem had four choices. It was said that any two students had at most one answer in common, find the maximum number of problems.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve two connected parts:\n\n## Part 1: Finding T for polynomial pairs\n\nGiven that $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are monic complex polynomials where:\n- $P(x)$ divides $Q(x)^2 + 1$\n- $Q(x)$ divides $P(x)^2 + 1$\n\nSince $P | Q^2 + 1$ and $Q | P^2 + 1$, we can show that:\n$$PQ | (Q^2 + 1)(P^2 + 1) = P^2Q^2 + P^2 + Q^2 + 1$$\n\nSince $PQ | P^2Q^2$, we have $PQ | P^2 + Q^2 + 1$.\n\nTherefore: $P^2 + Q^2 + 1 = PQT$ for some polynomial $T$.\n\n**Case 1: Degree 0**  \n$P = Q = 1$ gives $T = 3$.\n\n**Case 2: Degree 1**  \nLet $P = x + a$ and $Q = x + b$.\n\nFor $P | Q^2 + 1$: $(x+b)^2 + 1 = (x+a)(x+c)$\n\nExpanding: $x^2 + 2bx + b^2 + 1 = x^2 + (a+c)x + ac$\n\nThis gives: $2ab = a^2 + b^2 + 1$\n\nSimilarly, from $Q | P^2 + 1$, we get the same equation.\n\nRearranging: $(a-b)^2 = -1$, so $a = b \\pm i$.\n\nFor $P = x + i$ and $Q = x$:\n- $P^2 + Q^2 + 1 = 2x^2 + 2ix$\n- $PQ = x^2 + ix$\n- Therefore $T = 2$\n\nFor non-constant polynomials with equal degrees, comparing leading coefficients shows $T = 2$.\n\nGiven the problem context asks for \"the constant T\" for pairs meeting conditions, and the non-trivial polynomial cases give $T = 2$:\n\n$$k = T + 14 = 2 + 14 = 16$$\n\n## Part 2: Maximum number of problems\n\nWe have 16 students, 4 choices per problem, and any two students have at most 1 answer in common.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum length $n$ of a code where:\n- 16 codewords (students)\n- Alphabet size 4 (choices)  \n- Any two codewords agree in at most 1 position\n\nBy the Singleton bound for codes with minimum distance $d = n-1$:\n$$M \\leq q^{n-d+1}$$\n\nWith $M = 16$, $q = 4$, $d = n-1$:\n$$16 = 4^2 = 4^{n-(n-1)+1}$$\n\nFor $n = 2$: We can use all $4^2 = 16$ possible answer combinations. Any two distinct combinations differ in at least 1 position, so they agree in at most 1 position. ✓\n\nFor $n = 3$ or higher: We need to check if we can select 16 combinations from $4^n$ total such that any two agree in at most 1 position.\n\nUsing coding theory constructions (like shortened Reed-Solomon codes), we can achieve 16 codewords of length 5 over alphabet size 4 with any two agreeing in at most 1 position.\n\nThe maximum is achieved at **n = 5**.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found that for monic polynomial pairs P(x), Q(x) where P divides Q²+1 and Q divides P²+1, the non-trivial cases give T=2 (from the relation P²+Q²+1=PQT). Thus k=T+14=16. Then, for 16 students with 4-choice problems where any two students agree on at most 1 answer, this is equivalent to finding a code with 16 codewords over alphabet size 4 where any two codewords agree in at most 1 position. Using coding theory (specifically constructions related to Reed-Solomon codes), the maximum number of problems is 5.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
