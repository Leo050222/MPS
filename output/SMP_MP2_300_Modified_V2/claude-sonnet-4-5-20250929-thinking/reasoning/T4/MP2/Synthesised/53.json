  "math_problem": "If $P(x)$ denotes a polynomial of degree $n$ such that \\[P(k)=\\frac{k}{k+1}\\] for $k=0,1,2,\\ldots,n$ , determine $P(n+1)$ . Instead of determining the polynomial's value at the point immediately following the last given evaluation point, simply find $q = Q(-1)$, where $Q(x)$ is the auxiliary polynomial of degree $n+1$ defined by $Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x$. Let $z$ be a complex number. In the complex plane, the distance from $z$ to $q$ is $(q + 1)$ , and the distance from $z^{2}$ to $q$ is $(q + 5)$ . What is the real part of $z$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to first find $q = Q(-1)$, then use it to find the real part of $z$.\n\n## Finding $q = Q(-1)$\n\nGiven: $P(k) = \\frac{k}{k+1}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n$\n\nThe auxiliary polynomial is: $Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x$\n\nLet me check what happens when I evaluate $Q$ at the given points:\n$$Q(k) = (k+1)P(k) - k = (k+1) \\cdot \\frac{k}{k+1} - k = k - k = 0$$\n\nSo $Q(x)$ has roots at $x = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n$.\n\nTo find $Q(-1)$, I'll rewrite $Q(x)$:\n\nNote that $P(k) = \\frac{k}{k+1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{k+1}$\n\nSo: $P(x) = 1 - R(x)$ where $R(k) = \\frac{1}{k+1}$\n\nTherefore:\n$$Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x = (x+1)[1 - R(x)] - x$$\n$$= (x+1) - (x+1)R(x) - x = 1 - (x+1)R(x)$$\n\nAt $x = -1$:\n$$Q(-1) = 1 - (-1+1)R(-1) = 1 - 0 \\cdot R(-1) = 1$$\n\nSo $q = 1$.\n\n## Finding the Real Part of $z$\n\nGiven:\n- Distance from $z$ to $q$ is $(q + 1)$: $|z - 1| = 2$\n- Distance from $z^2$ to $q$ is $(q + 5)$: $|z^2 - 1| = 6$\n\nLet $z = x + iy$ where $x, y$ are real.\n\nFrom $|z - 1| = 2$:\n$$(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 4$$\n\nFrom $|z^2 - 1| = 6$, I can use the factorization:\n$$|z^2 - 1| = |(z-1)(z+1)| = |z-1| \\cdot |z+1| = 2|z+1| = 6$$\n\nTherefore: $|z+1| = 3$\n\nThis gives:\n$$(x + 1)^2 + y^2 = 9$$\n\nNow I have two equations:\n- $(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 4$ → $x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 = 4$ → $x^2 + y^2 = 2x + 3$\n- $(x + 1)^2 + y^2 = 9$ → $x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 = 9$ → $x^2 + y^2 = 8 - 2x$\n\nSetting these equal:\n$$2x + 3 = 8 - 2x$$\n$$4x = 5$$\n$$x = \\frac{5}{4}$$\n\nLet me verify: If $x = \\frac{5}{4}$:\n- From first equation: $(\\frac{1}{4})^2 + y^2 = 4$ → $y^2 = \\frac{63}{16}$ ✓\n- From second equation: $(\\frac{9}{4})^2 + y^2 = 9$ → $y^2 = \\frac{63}{16}$ ✓\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found q = Q(-1) by using the definition Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x. Since P(k) = k/(k+1) = 1 - 1/(k+1), I showed that Q(x) = 1 - (x+1)R(x) where R represents the reciprocal part. At x = -1, this gives Q(-1) = 1, so q = 1. Then, using the distance conditions |z - 1| = 2 and |z² - 1| = 6, I factored the second condition as |z-1||z+1| = 6, which gives |z+1| = 3. Setting z = x + iy, I obtained two circle equations: (x-1)² + y² = 4 and (x+1)² + y² = 9. Expanding and subtracting these equations gives 4x = 5, so x = 5/4.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5/4\"\n}",
