  "math_problem": "Find the number of triples of sets $(A, B, C)$ such that: (a) $A, B, C \\subseteq\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 8\\}$. (b) $|A \\cap B|=|B \\cap C|=|C \\cap A|=2$. (c) $|A|=|B|=|C|=4$. Here, $|S|$ denotes the number of elements in the set $S$. Instead of determining the total number of such triples of sets, simply find $m = |A \\cap B \\cap C|$, where $|A \\cap B \\cap C|$ is the size of the triple intersection derived from the structural consideration of configurations with no elements belonging to exactly two of the sets. Compute the number of ways there are to assemble $m$ red unit cubes and $(m + 23)$ white unit cubes into a $(m + 1) \\times (m + 1) \\times (m + 1)$ cube such that red is visible on exactly 4 faces of the larger cube. (Rotations and reflections are considered distinct.)",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to first find $m = |A \\cap B \\cap C|$, then solve the cube assembly problem.\n\n## Part 1: Finding m\n\nGiven conditions:\n- $|A| = |B| = |C| = 4$\n- $|A \\cap B| = |B \\cap C| = |C \\cap A| = 2$\n\nLet me use a Venn diagram approach. Define:\n- $x = |A \\cap B \\cap C|$ (elements in all three sets)\n- $a = |A \\cap B| - |A \\cap B \\cap C|$ (in A and B, not C)\n- $b = |B \\cap C| - |A \\cap B \\cap C|$ (in B and C, not A)  \n- $c = |C \\cap A| - |A \\cap B \\cap C|$ (in C and A, not B)\n- $d, e, f$ = elements only in A, B, C respectively\n\nFrom the given conditions:\n- $x + a = 2$, so $a = 2 - x$\n- $x + b = 2$, so $b = 2 - x$\n- $x + c = 2$, so $c = 2 - x$\n\nFor set A: $|A| = x + a + c + d = x + (2-x) + (2-x) + d = 4$\nThis gives $4 - x + d = 4$, so $d = x$\n\nSimilarly, $e = x$ and $f = x$.\n\nThe problem specifies \"configurations with no elements belonging to exactly two of the sets,\" meaning $a = b = c = 0$.\n\nIf $a = 0$, then $2 - x = 0$, so $x = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $m = 2$.\n\n## Part 2: Cube Assembly\n\nWith $m = 2$:\n- Red cubes: 2\n- White cubes: $2 + 23 = 25$\n- Total: 27 cubes in a $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ cube ✓\n\nI need to place 2 red cubes so red is visible on exactly 4 of the 6 faces.\n\nIn a $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ cube using coordinates $(i,j,k)$ where $i,j,k \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$:\n- **Corners** (8 total): visible on 3 faces each\n- **Edges** (12 total): visible on 2 faces each\n- **Face centers** (6 total): visible on 1 face each\n- **Center** (1 total): visible on 0 faces\n\nFor 2 cubes to be visible on exactly 4 faces total, if they're on $f_1$ and $f_2$ faces with $s$ shared faces:\n$f_1 + f_2 - s = 4$\n\n**Case 1: Two corners sharing 2 faces** ($3 + 3 - 2 = 4$)\n- Adjacent corners differ in exactly 1 coordinate\n- Pairs differing in x-coordinate: 4\n- Pairs differing in y-coordinate: 4  \n- Pairs differing in z-coordinate: 4\n- Total: **12 ways**\n\n**Case 2: Corner and edge sharing 1 face** ($3 + 2 - 1 = 4$)\n- Each corner is on 3 faces\n- For each corner, there are 6 edges sharing exactly 1 face with it\n- Total: $8 \\times 6 = $ **48 ways**\n\n**Case 3: Corner and face center on different faces** ($3 + 1 - 0 = 4$)\n- Each corner is on 3 of 6 faces\n- Each corner pairs with 3 face centers on the other 3 faces\n- Total: $8 \\times 3 = $ **24 ways**\n\n**Case 4: Two edges on no common faces** ($2 + 2 - 0 = 4$)\n- Need 4 distinct faces covered\n\nEdges parallel to same axis covering all 4 perpendicular faces:\n- x-axis edges: 2 pairs\n- y-axis edges: 2 pairs\n- z-axis edges: 2 pairs\n- Subtotal: 6 pairs\n\nEdges parallel to different axes with no shared faces:\n- x-axis and y-axis edges: 8 pairs\n- x-axis and z-axis edges: 8 pairs\n- y-axis and z-axis edges: 8 pairs\n- Subtotal: 24 pairs\n\nTotal: $6 + 24 = $ **30 ways**\n\n**Total: $12 + 48 + 24 + 30 = 114$**\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"First, I found m = |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 2 by analyzing the constraint that no elements belong to exactly two sets. Then I calculated the number of ways to place 2 red cubes in a 3×3×3 cube so red is visible on exactly 4 faces. I systematically counted four cases: (1) two adjacent corners sharing 2 faces (12 ways), (2) corner and edge sharing 1 face (48 ways), (3) corner and face center on different faces (24 ways), and (4) two edges on no common faces (30 ways).
