  "math_problem": "Given $30$ students such that each student has at most $5$ friends and for every $5$ students there is a pair of students that are not friends, determine the maximum $k$ such that for all such possible configurations, there exists $k$ students who are all not friends. Instead of determining the maximum such $k$, simply find $d = \\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) + 1644$, where $\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6)$ is the maximum number of edges in a graph on $30$ vertices with no clique of $6$ vertices derived from the extremal analysis of the complement of the friendship graph. How many real numbers $x$ are solutions to the following equation? $$(d - 1)^{x}+d^{x}=(d + 1)^{x}$$",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Calculate $\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6)$\n2. Find $d = \\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) + 1644$\n3. Determine how many real solutions exist for $(d-1)^x + d^x = (d+1)^x$\n\n## Step 1: Calculate $\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6)$\n\nThe Turán number $\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6)$ represents the maximum number of edges in a graph on 30 vertices with no clique of size 6. This is achieved by the Turán graph $T(30, 5)$, which is a complete 5-partite graph.\n\nFor 30 vertices divided into 5 parts: $30 = 5 \\times 6$, so each part has 6 vertices.\n\nThe number of edges in the Turán graph is:\n$$\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) = \\binom{30}{2} - 5\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{30 \\times 29}{2} - 5 \\times \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 435 - 75 = 360$$\n\n## Step 2: Calculate $d$\n\n$$d = 360 + 1644 = 2004$$\n\n## Step 3: Solve $(d-1)^x + d^x = (d+1)^x$\n\nThis becomes: $2003^x + 2004^x = 2005^x$\n\nLet me analyze this by dividing both sides by $(d+1)^x = 2005^x$:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{2003}{2005}\\right)^x + \\left(\\frac{2004}{2005}\\right)^x = 1$$\n\nLet $g(x) = \\left(\\frac{2003}{2005}\\right)^x + \\left(\\frac{2004}{2005}\\right)^x$\n\nLet $\\alpha = \\frac{2003}{2005}$ and $\\beta = \\frac{2004}{2005}$, where $0 < \\alpha < \\beta < 1$.\n\n**Analyzing $g(x)$:**\n\n- As $x \\to -\\infty$: Both $\\alpha^x \\to \\infty$ and $\\beta^x \\to \\infty$, so $g(x) \\to \\infty$\n- At $x = 0$: $g(0) = 1 + 1 = 2 > 1$\n- As $x \\to +\\infty$: Both $\\alpha^x \\to 0$ and $\\beta^x \\to 0$, so $g(x) \\to 0$\n\n**Checking monotonicity:**\n\n$$g'(x) = \\alpha^x \\ln(\\alpha) + \\beta^x \\ln(\\beta)$$\n\nSince $\\alpha < 1$ and $\\beta < 1$, we have $\\ln(\\alpha) < 0$ and $\\ln(\\beta) < 0$.\n\nTherefore, $g'(x) < 0$ for all $x$, meaning $g(x)$ is strictly decreasing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince $g(x)$ is:\n- Continuous\n- Strictly decreasing\n- Goes from $\\infty$ (when $x \\to -\\infty$) to $0$ (when $x \\to +\\infty$)\n\nThe function $g(x)$ crosses the value $1$ exactly once.\n\nTherefore, there is exactly **1** real solution to the equation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"First, I calculated ex(30, K_6) using the Turán graph T(30,5), which gives 360 edges. Then d = 360 + 1644 = 2004. For the equation 2003^x + 2004^x = 2005^x, I analyzed g(x) = (2003/2005)^x + (2004/2005)^x. Since both base fractions are less than 1, g(x) is strictly decreasing from infinity to 0. It equals 2 at x=0 and approaches 0 as x increases. By the intermediate value theorem and strict monotonicity, there is exactly one value of x where g(x) = 1.\",\n  \"answer\": \"1\"\n}\n```",
