  "math_problem": "Determine all composite positive integers $n$ for which it is possible to arrange all divisors of $n$ that are greater than 1 in a circle so that no two adjacent divisors are relatively prime. Instead of determining all composite positive integers $n$ for which such a circular arrangement exists, simply find $k = \\gcd(p, q) + 1$, where $p$ and $q$ are the distinct prime factors of $n$ in the case where the set of divisors of $n$ greater than 1 has exactly three elements. Let $\\mathbb{N}$ denote the set of positive integers. Find all functions $f : \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that for positive integers $a$ and $b,$ \n\\[f(a^k + b^k) = f(a)f(b) \\text{ and } f(a^k) = f(a)^k.\\]",

Then using condition 1 with k=2 and specific values, I derived that f(1)^5 = f(1)^3, which forces f(1) = 1 since f maps to positive integers.
