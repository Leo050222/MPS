  "math_problem": "Find all positive integers $n, k_1, \\dots, k_n$ such that $k_1 + \\cdots + k_n = 5n-4$ and \\[ \\frac{1}{k_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{k_n} = 1. \\] Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ and corresponding $k_1, \\dots, k_n$ satisfying the sum and reciprocal sum conditions, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the part size in the solution with the smallest possible $n$, derived from the structural consideration of minimal number of terms in the representation. Alice and Bob play a game on a board consisting of one row of $k + 2021$ consecutive squares. They take turns placing tiles that cover two adjacent squares, with Alice going first. By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule. Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends; Bob's goal is to minimize it. What is the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure at the end of the game, no matter how Bob plays?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve two parts:\n\n## Part 1: Finding k\n\nI need to find positive integers satisfying:\n- $k_1 + \\cdots + k_n = 5n-4$\n- $\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{k_n} = 1$\n\nLet me consider the case where all $k_i$ are equal to some value $k$ (uniform partition).\n\nIf $k_1 = k_2 = \\cdots = k_n = k$:\n- Sum condition: $nk = 5n - 4$\n- Reciprocal condition: $\\frac{n}{k} = 1$, so $k = n$\n\nSubstituting $k = n$ into the sum condition:\n$$n^2 = 5n - 4$$\n$$n^2 - 5n + 4 = 0$$\n$$(n-1)(n-4) = 0$$\n\nSo $n = 1$ or $n = 4$.\n\nFor **n = 1**: $k = 1$\n- Check: $k_1 = 1$, sum = $1 = 5(1)-4 = 1$ ✓\n- Reciprocal: $\\frac{1}{1} = 1$ ✓\n\nFor **n = 4**: $k = 4$\n- Check: $4+4+4+4 = 16 = 5(4)-4 = 16$ ✓\n- Reciprocal: $4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 1$ ✓\n\nThe smallest possible $n$ is **1**, giving $k = 1$.\n\n## Part 2: The Tile Game\n\nThe board has $k + 2021 = 1 + 2021 = 2022$ consecutive squares.\n\nAlice and Bob alternate placing tiles covering 2 adjacent squares, with Alice going first. The game ends when no tile can be placed (all remaining uncovered squares are isolated - no two adjacent uncovered squares remain).\n\n**Key Strategy**: Think of the 2022 squares as groups of 3 consecutive squares:\n- Group 1: squares (1,2,3)\n- Group 2: squares (4,5,6)\n- ...\n- Group 674: squares (2020,2021,2022)\n\nSince $2022 = 3 \\times 674$, there are exactly 674 groups.\n\n**Alice's Winning Strategy**:\n\nAlice can guarantee that each group of 3 squares ends up with exactly 1 uncovered square. Here's why:\n\n1. In any group of 3 consecutive squares, at most one tile (2 squares) can be fully placed within that group, leaving 1 square uncovered.\n\n2. If Bob places a tile spanning across two groups, he uses his turn less efficiently, allowing Alice to maintain control over individual groups.\n\n3. Alice can adopt a defensive strategy: whenever Bob covers 2 squares in a group, that group is \"settled\" with 1 uncovered square. Alice focuses on other groups.\n\n4. Alice can ensure that in each of the 674 groups, exactly one square remains uncovered.\n\n**Verification with smaller examples**:\n- For 3 squares (1 group): Alice places tile on (2,3), leaving square 1 uncovered. Result: 1 uncovered ✓\n- For 6 squares (2 groups): Alice can guarantee 2 uncovered squares ✓\n\nTherefore, for 2022 squares (674 groups of 3), Alice can ensure **674 uncovered squares**.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found that the smallest n satisfying both conditions is n=1 with k=1, giving a board of 2022 squares. For the tile game, I recognized that Alice can use a strategy based on dividing the 2022 squares into 674 groups of 3 consecutive squares. Alice can guarantee that each group ends with exactly 1 uncovered square, since at most one tile can be placed within each group of 3. This gives 674 uncovered squares total.\",\n    \"answer\": \"674\"\n}",
