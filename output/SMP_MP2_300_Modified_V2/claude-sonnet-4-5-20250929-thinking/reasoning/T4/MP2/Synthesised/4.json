  "math_problem": "Determine the form of $n$ such that $2^n + 2$ is divisible by $n$ where $n$ is less than 100. Instead of determining the possible values of $n$ less than 100 for which $n$ divides $2^n + 2$, simply find $n$, where $n$ is the largest positive integer less than 100 satisfying this divisibility condition. Determine all pairs $(h, s)$ of positive integers with the following property: If one draws $h$ horizontal lines and another $s$ lines which satisfy (i) they are not horizontal, (ii) no two of them are parallel, (iii) no three of the $h+s$ lines are concurrent, then the number of regions formed by these $h+s$ lines is $n + 1926$.",
