  "reasoning_content": "## Reasoning\n\nLet me work through this problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Find the smallest integer $a > 1$ satisfying $4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1$\n\nThis is a Pell equation. I can rewrite it as $x^2 - 3y^2 = 1$ where $x = 2b$ and $y = a$, with the constraint that $x$ must be even.\n\nThe fundamental solution to $x^2 - 3y^2 = 1$ is $(x, y) = (2, 1)$.\n\nThe general solutions follow from $(x_n + y_n\\sqrt{3}) = (2 + \\sqrt{3})^n$:\n- $n = 1$: $(2 + \\sqrt{3})^1 = 2 + \\sqrt{3}$, giving $(x_1, y_1) = (2, 1)$, so $a = 1, b = 1$\n- $n = 2$: $(2 + \\sqrt{3})^2 = 7 + 4\\sqrt{3}$, giving $(x_2, y_2) = (7, 4)$\n  - But $x = 2b$ requires $b = 7/2$, which is not an integer\n- $n = 3$: $(2 + \\sqrt{3})^3 = 26 + 15\\sqrt{3}$, giving $(x_3, y_3) = (26, 15)$\n  - Here $a = 15$ and $b = 13$ (since $x = 26 = 2b$)\n\nLet me verify: $4(13)^2 - 3(15)^2 = 676 - 675 = 1$ ✓\n\nSince we need $a > 1$, the smallest such $a$ is $\\boxed{a = 15}$.\n\nTherefore, $d = a - 14 = 15 - 14 = 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Find the polynomial $P$ of degree 5\n\nGiven $z^5 + 2004z = 1$, I need to find $P$ such that $P(z^2) = 0$.\n\nLet $w = z^2$. Then:\n- $z^2 = w$\n- $z^4 = w^2$\n- $z^5 = z \\cdot w^2$\n\nFrom $z^5 + 2004z = 1$:\n$$zw^2 + 2004z = 1$$\n$$z(w^2 + 2004) = 1$$\n$$z = \\frac{1}{w^2 + 2004}$$\n\nSince $z^2 = w$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{w^2 + 2004}\\right)^2 = w$$\n$$\\frac{1}{(w^2 + 2004)^2} = w$$\n$$w(w^2 + 2004)^2 = 1$$\n\nExpanding:\n$$w(w^4 + 4008w^2 + 2004^2) = 1$$\n$$w^5 + 4008w^3 + 4016016w - 1 = 0$$\n\nSo $P(w) = w^5 + 4008w^3 + 4016016w - 1$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate $P(d)/P(-d)$ with $d = 1$\n\n$$P(1) = 1^5 + 4008(1)^3 + 4016016(1) - 1 = 1 + 4008 + 4016016 - 1 = 4020024$$\n\n$$P(-1) = (-1)^5 + 4008(-1)^3 + 4016016(-1) - 1 = -1 - 4008 - 4016016 - 1 = -4020026$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \\frac{4020024}{-4020026}$$\n\nSimplifying by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n$$\\frac{4020024}{-4020026} = \\frac{2010012}{-2010013} = -\\frac{2010012}{2010013}$$\n\nSince $2010012$ and $2010013$ are consecutive integers, they are coprime, so this fraction is already in simplest form.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I solved the Pell equation 4b² - 3a² = 1 to find a = 15, giving d = 1. Then I derived the polynomial P(w) = w⁵ + 4008w³ + 4016016w - 1 from the constraint z⁵ + 2004z = 1.
