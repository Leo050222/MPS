  "math_problem": "A sequence of functions $\\\\{ f_n(x) \\\\} $ is defined recursively as follows: \\begin{align*} f_1(x) &= \\sqrt {x^2 + 48}, \\quad \\text{and} \\\\ f_{n + 1}(x) &= \\sqrt {x^2 + 6f_n(x)} \\quad \\text{for } n \\geq 1. \\end{align*} (Recall that $\\sqrt {\\makebox[5mm]{}}$ is understood to represent the positive square root .) For each positive integer $n$ , find all real solutions of the equation $ f_n(x) = 2x $ . Instead of finding all real solutions of the equation $f_n(x) = 2x$ for each positive integer $n$, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the constant satisfying $f_1(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 6k}$ derived from the given definition. One day, there is a Street Art Show at somewhere, and there are some spectators around. We consider this place as an Euclidean plane. Let $K$ be the center of the show. And name the spectators by $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}, \\ldots$ They pick their positions $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}, \\ldots$ one by one. The positions need to satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously. (i) The distance between $K$ and $A_{n}$ is no less than 10 meters, that is, $K P_{n} \\geq 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any positive integer $n$. (ii) The distance between $A_{n}$ and any previous spectator is no less than $(k - 7)$ meters, that is, $P_{m} P_{n} \\geq (k - 7) \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any $n \\geq 2$ and any $1 \\leq m \\leq n-1$. (iii) $A_{n}$ always choose the position closest to $K$ that satisfies (i) and (ii), that is, $K P_{n}$ reaches its minimum possible value. If there are more than one point that satisfy (i) and (ii) and have the minimum distance to $K, A_{n}$ may choose any one of them. For example, $A_{1}$ is not restricted by (ii), so he may choose any point on the circle $C$ which is centered at $K$ with radius $(k + 2)$ meters. For $A_{2}$, since there are lots of points on $C$ which are at least $(k - 7)$ meters apart from $P_{1}$, he may choose anyone of them. (1) Which of the following statement is true? (A) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2}$ always hold (unit: meter); (B) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\sqrt{n} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} \\sqrt{n}$ always hold (unit: meter); (C) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n$ always hold (unit: meter); (D) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n^{2} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n^{2}$ always hold (unit: meter).",

Using area arguments, in an annulus of inner radius 10 and outer radius r, we can fit approximately π(r² - 100) points with 1-meter spacing. For n points, this gives r ~ sqrt(n/π + 100), which for large n behaves like sqrt(n). Both lower and upper bounds grow like sqrt(n) with appropriate constants c₁ and c₂, making option (B) correct.\",\n    \"answer\": \"B\"\n}",
