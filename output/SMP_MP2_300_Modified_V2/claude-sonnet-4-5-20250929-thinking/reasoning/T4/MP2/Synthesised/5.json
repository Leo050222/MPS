  "math_problem": "Find all integers $n$ satisfying $n \\\\geq 2$ and $\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(n)}{p(n)-1}=n$, in which $\\\\sigma(n)$ denotes the sum of all positive divisors of $n$, and $p(n)$ denotes the largest prime divisor of $n$. Instead of identifying all integers satisfying the condition relating the sum of divisors to the largest prime divisor, simply find $k$, the number of distinct prime factors shared by any such integer. Let $n$ be an integer of the form $a^{k}+b^{k}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)=k-1$ and if $p$ is a prime, $p \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{n}$, then $p$ divides $a b$. Determine all such $n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to work through it systematically in parts.\n\n## Part 1: Finding integers satisfying the divisor sum condition\n\nI need to find $n \\geq 2$ where $\\frac{\\sigma(n)}{p(n)-1} = n$, which is equivalent to:\n$$\\sigma(n) = n(p(n) - 1)$$\n\nLet me test $n = 2 \\cdot p$ where $p$ is an odd prime:\n- $\\sigma(2p) = 1 + 2 + p + 2p = 3(1+p)$\n- $p(2p) = p$ (largest prime divisor)\n\nSetting up the equation:\n$$\\frac{3(1+p)}{p-1} = 2p$$\n$$3(1+p) = 2p(p-1)$$\n$$3 + 3p = 2p^2 - 2p$$\n$$2p^2 - 5p - 3 = 0$$\n$$(2p+1)(p-3) = 0$$\n\nSince $p$ must be a positive prime, $p = 3$, giving us $n = 6$.\n\nLet me verify: $\\sigma(6) = 1+2+3+6 = 12$, $p(6) = 3$, so $\\frac{12}{3-1} = 6$ ✓\n\nTesting other forms (like $p^2$, $2^a p$ for $a \\geq 2$, etc.) yields no integer solutions.\n\nTherefore, $n = 6 = 2 \\cdot 3$ is the solution, which has $k = 2$ distinct prime factors.\n\n## Part 2: Finding $n = a^k + b^k$ with the given constraints\n\nUsing $k = 2$ from Part 1, I need to find all $n = a^2 + b^2$ where:\n- $\\gcd(a,b) = k-1 = 1$\n- For every prime $p \\leq \\sqrt{n}$, we have $p | ab$\n\nLet me check small values systematically:\n\n**$n = 2$:** $2 = 1^2 + 1^2$\n- $\\gcd(1,1) = 1$ ✓\n- $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41$, so no primes $\\leq \\sqrt{2}$ (condition vacuously true) ✓\n\n**$n = 5$:** $5 = 1^2 + 2^2$\n- $\\gcd(1,2) = 1$ ✓\n- Primes $\\leq \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.24$: just $p = 2$\n- $2 | (1 \\cdot 2) = 2$ ✓\n\n**$n = 13$:** $13 = 2^2 + 3^2$\n- $\\gcd(2,3) = 1$ ✓\n- Primes $\\leq \\sqrt{13} \\approx 3.61$: $p = 2, 3$\n- $2, 3 | (2 \\cdot 3) = 6$ ✓\n\n**For $n \\geq 25$:**\n- We need primes $2, 3, 5 | ab$, so $30 | ab$\n- But with $a^2 + b^2 \\geq 25$ and $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$, if $ab \\geq 30$, then $a^2 + b^2$ must be much larger\n- By AM-GM: $ab \\leq \\frac{a^2+b^2}{2} = \\frac{n}{2}$\n- The product of primes up to $\\sqrt{n}$ grows exponentially while $n/2$ grows linearly, making it impossible for large $n$\n\nChecking remaining cases up to 25 shows none satisfy all conditions.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I solved the equation σ(n) = n(p(n)-1) and found that n = 6 is the only solution, giving k = 2 distinct prime factors. Then, using k = 2, I found all n = a² + b² with gcd(a,b) = 1 where every prime p ≤ √n divides ab. By systematic checking and noting that the primorial grows too quickly for large n, only three values work: n = 2, 5, and 13.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2, 5, 13\"\n}",
