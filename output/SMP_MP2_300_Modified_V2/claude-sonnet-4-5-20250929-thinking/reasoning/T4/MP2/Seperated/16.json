Let the group sizes be $n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4$ where $\\sum n_i = 16$.\n\nThe number of student pairs that agree on this problem is:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\binom{n_i}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{4} n_i(n_i-1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{4} n_i^2 - 16\\right)$$\n\nBy the constraint that $\\sum n_i = 16$ and using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{4} n_i^2 \\geq \\frac{(\\sum n_i)^2}{4} = \\frac{256}{4} = 64$$\n\nTherefore, each problem has at least $\\frac{1}{2}(64-16) = 24$ pairs of students who agree.\n\n**Upper bound:**\n\nTotal number of student pairs: $\\binom{16}{2} = 120$\n\nSince each pair can agree on at most 1 problem, and each problem accounts for at least 24 agreeing pairs:\n$$n \\cdot 24 \\leq 120$$\n$$n \\leq 5$$\n\n**Achievability:**\n\nThis maximum is achievable using an affine plane of order 4, which has exactly 16 points (students), 20 lines (with 4 points each), organized into 5 parallel classes. Each parallel class represents one problem with 4 answer choices. In this construction, any two points lie on exactly one common line, meaning any two students agree on exactly one problem.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of problems is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Found that for monic polynomials satisfying the divisibility conditions, T=2 as a constant, giving k=T+14=16.
