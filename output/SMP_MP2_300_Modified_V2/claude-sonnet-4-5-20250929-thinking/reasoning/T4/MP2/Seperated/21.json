For Problem 2: By Fermat's Little Theorem, primes dividing x^13-x for all x are those where p-1|12, giving p∈{2,3,5,7,13}. Checking x=p shows no prime powers p^k with k≥2 work. So n must divide 2·3·5·7·13=2730 with no repeated factors. There are 2^5=32 such divisors including 1, so 31 divisors greater than 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"31\"\n}\n```",
