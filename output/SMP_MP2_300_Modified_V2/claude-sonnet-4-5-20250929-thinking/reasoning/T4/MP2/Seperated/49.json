Computing Q(0) directly gives Q(0) = 0²·P(0) - 1 = -1, so d = Q(0) + 5 = 4. For Problem 2: Given that two roots multiply to -32 and using Vieta's formulas with the product of all roots being -1984, found that the other two roots multiply to 62. Factoring the polynomial and comparing coefficients led to a system of equations yielding u = 4 and v = 14, giving k = 30 + uv = 86.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"86\"\n}",
