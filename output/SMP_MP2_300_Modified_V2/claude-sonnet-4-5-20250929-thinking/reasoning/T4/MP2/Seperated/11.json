  "reasoning_content": "Looking at both problems:\n\n## Problem 1:\n\nThe problem statement appears incomplete as the functional equation itself is not shown in the text (it mentions \"for all pairs of real numbers $x$ and $y$\" but the equation is missing). \n\nHowever, for most standard functional equations, we can find $f(0)$ by substituting $x = y = 0$.\n\nFor common functional equations like:\n- $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$: Setting $x = y = 0$ gives $f(0) = f(0) + f(0) = 2f(0)$, so $f(0) = 0$\n- $f(xy) = f(x) + f(y)$: Setting $x = y = 0$ gives $f(0) = f(0) + f(0) = 2f(0)$, so $f(0) = 0$\n\nBased on standard functional equations that commonly appear in olympiad problems, **$f(0) = 0$**.\n\n## Problem 2:\n\nFor a light pulse bouncing in a square from corner to corner:\n\n**Setting up the problem:**\n- We can \"unfold\" the reflections by tiling the plane with reflected copies of the square\n- In the unfolded space, the light travels in a straight line from $(0,0)$ to some point $(a,b)$\n- For the path to end at a corner, $a$ and $b$ must be integers\n- For the path to end at a *different* corner, we need at least one of $a,b$ to be odd\n- For the path not to hit an intermediate corner, we need $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$\n\n**Number of reflections:**\nThe number of reflections is: $n = a + b - 2$\n\n**Number of regions:**\nFor a billiard path with parameters $(a,b)$ where $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$, the number of regions created is: $R = ab$\n\n**Finding the minimum $n$:**\nWe need $ab = 2021$\n\nFactoring: $2021 = 43 \\times 47$ (both are prime numbers)\n\nSince 43 and 47 are both prime, $\\gcd(43, 47) = 1$ automatically.\n\nThe possible factorizations of 2021 are:\n- $(a,b) = (1, 2021)$: $n = 1 + 2021 - 2 = 2020$\n- $(a,b) = (43, 47)$: $n = 43 + 47 - 2 = 88$\n- $(a,b) = (47, 43)$: $n = 47 + 43 - 2 = 88$\n- $(a,b) = (2021, 1)$: $n = 2021 + 1 - 2 = 2020$\n\nChecking that we end at a different corner:\n- For $(43, 47)$: both odd → ends at opposite corner ✓\n- For $(1, 2021)$: one even, one odd → ends at adjacent corner ✓\n\nThe smallest possible value is **$n = 88$**.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, the functional equation is not shown in the problem statement, but for standard functional equations, substituting x=y=0 typically yields f(0)=0. For Problem 2, using the billiard ball unfolding method, we need ab=2021 with gcd(a,b)=1. Since 2021=43×47, the minimum number of reflections is n=43+47-2=88.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"88\"\n}\n```",
