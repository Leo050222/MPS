For each face the corner touches, there are 2 edge positions on that face (not adjacent to the corner) that share only that 1 face.\n- 3 faces × 2 edges per face = 6 edges per corner\n- 8 corners × 6 edges = **48 configurations**\n\n**Case 4: One corner, one face center (sharing 0 faces)**\nEach corner touches 3 faces, leaving 3 opposite faces. Each opposite face has 1 face center.\n- 8 corners × 3 opposite face centers = **24 configurations**\n\n**Total: 12 + 6 + 48 + 24 = 90**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, using inclusion-exclusion with the constraint that no elements belong to exactly two sets gives x=2.
