  "reasoning_content": "## Problem 1: Finding $d = \\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) + 1644$\n\nThe Turán number $\\mathrm{ex}(n, K_r)$ represents the maximum number of edges in a graph on $n$ vertices that contains no clique of size $r$. This maximum is achieved by the Turán graph $T(n, r-1)$.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6)$, we need the Turán graph $T(30, 5)$, which is a complete 5-partite graph on 30 vertices.\n\n**Step 1:** Determine the partition sizes.\nSince $30 = 6 \\times 5 + 0$, we divide 30 vertices into 5 equal parts of 6 vertices each.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the number of edges.\nThe Turán graph is complete between parts but has no edges within parts. The number of edges is:\n\n$$\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) = \\binom{30}{2} - 5 \\cdot \\binom{6}{2}$$\n\n$$= \\frac{30 \\cdot 29}{2} - 5 \\cdot \\frac{6 \\cdot 5}{2}$$\n\n$$= 435 - 5 \\cdot 15 = 435 - 75 = 360$$\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate $d$.\n$$d = 360 + 1644 = 2004$$\n\n## Problem 2: Solving $2003^x + 2004^x = 2005^x$\n\n**Step 1:** Transform the equation.\nDivide both sides by $2005^x$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{2003}{2005}\\right)^x + \\left(\\frac{2004}{2005}\\right)^x = 1$$\n\nLet $f(x) = \\left(\\frac{2003}{2005}\\right)^x + \\left(\\frac{2004}{2005}\\right)^x$\n\n**Step 2:** Analyze the function $f(x)$.\n- At $x = 0$: $f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2 > 1$\n- As $x \\to \\infty$: $f(x) \\to 0 < 1$ (since both bases are less than 1)\n- As $x \\to -\\infty$: $f(x) \\to \\infty > 1$ (since both bases are less than 1)\n\n**Step 3:** Check monotonicity.\nThe derivative is:\n$$f'(x) = \\left(\\frac{2003}{2005}\\right)^x \\ln\\left(\\frac{2003}{2005}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2004}{2005}\\right)^x \\ln\\left(\\frac{2004}{2005}\\right)$$\n\nSince $0 < \\frac{2003}{2005} < 1$ and $0 < \\frac{2004}{2005} < 1$, both logarithms are negative, so $f'(x) < 0$ for all $x$.\n\n**Step 4:** Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem.\nSince $f(x)$ is:\n- Continuous everywhere\n- Strictly decreasing\n- Has $f(0) = 2 > 1$\n- Has $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = 0 < 1$\n\nThere exists exactly **one** value $x_0 > 0$ such that $f(x_0) = 1$.\n\n**Step 5:** Check for negative solutions.\nFor $x < 0$, since $f$ is strictly decreasing and $f(0) = 2 > 1$, we have $f(x) > 2 > 1$ for all $x < 0$. Therefore, there are no solutions for $x < 0$.\n\nThe equation has exactly **1** real solution.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Using the Turán theorem, ex(30, K_6) is achieved by T(30,5), a complete 5-partite graph with parts of size 6 each.
