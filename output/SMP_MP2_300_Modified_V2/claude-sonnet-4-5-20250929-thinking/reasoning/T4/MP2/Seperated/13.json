Let $N = 2^{\\beta} \\cdot 2017 \\cdot M$ where $M$ is odd and coprime to 2017.\n\nFor $k = 2017$ to work:\n- $2N/2017 = 2^{\\beta+1} \\cdot M$ is even (requires $\\beta \\geq 0$)\n- $2017 \\leq \\sqrt{2N}$\n\nFor other values not to work, let me try the simplest case: $M = 1$ and find appropriate $\\beta$.\n\nIf $N = 2^{\\beta} \\cdot 2017$, then $2N = 2^{\\beta+1} \\cdot 2017$ and $\\sqrt{2N} = 2^{(\\beta+1)/2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2017} \\approx 2^{(\\beta+1)/2} \\cdot 44.9$\n\nFor only $k = 2017$ to work:\n- $k = 2^i$ for $i \\leq \\beta$: same parity as $2N/k$, doesn't work ✓\n- $k = 2^{\\beta+1}$: opposite parity, but we need $2^{\\beta+1} > \\sqrt{2N}$\n\nThis requires: $2^{\\beta+1} > 2^{(\\beta+1)/2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2017}$\nSimplifying: $2^{(\\beta+1)/2} > \\sqrt{2017} \\approx 44.9$\nSo: $\\beta + 1 > 2\\log_2(44.9) \\approx 11.2$, meaning $\\beta \\geq 11$\n\nWith $\\beta = 11$: $N = 2^{11} \\cdot 2017 = 2048 \\cdot 2017$\n- $\\sqrt{2N} = 2^6 \\cdot \\sqrt{2017} \\approx 2877$\n- $k = 2017 < 2877$ ✓\n- $k = 2^{12} = 4096 > 2877$ ✓\n\nTherefore $a = \\frac{N}{2017} - 1008 = 2048 - 1008 = 1040$\n\nAnd $m = a - 13 = 1040 - 13 = \\boxed{1027}$\n\n## Problem 2: Tiling a $3 \\times 8$ rectangle\n\nFor a $3 \\times n$ rectangle, there's a well-known recurrence relation for the number of tilings $a_n$:\n\n$$a_n = 4a_{n-2} - a_{n-4}$$\n\nWith initial conditions:\n- $a_0 = 1$ (empty rectangle)\n- $a_2 = 3$ (three ways to tile $3 \\times 2$)\n\nComputing:\n- $a_2 = 3$\n- $a_4 = 4(3) - 1 = 11$\n- $a_6 = 4(11) - 3 = 41$\n- $a_8 = 4(41) - 11 = 164 - 11 = 153$\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Need N expressible as sum of k=2017 consecutive integers only. From N = k(2a+k-1)/2, for k=2017 to be unique, N must be even (so k=2 fails). Trying N = 2^β · 2017 with β=11 works: only k=2017 satisfies all conditions. This gives a = 2048 - 1008 = 1040, so m = a - 13 = 1027.
