  "reasoning_content": "Looking at both problems, I'll solve them step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nGiven: $P(k) = \\frac{k}{k+1}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, where $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$.\n\nWe define $Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x$.\n\nFirst, let me find what $Q(k)$ equals at the given points:\n$$Q(k) = (k+1)P(k) - k = (k+1) \\cdot \\frac{k}{k+1} - k = k - k = 0$$\n\nSo $Q(x)$ has roots at $x = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n$.\n\nSince $P(x)$ has degree $n$, the polynomial $Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x$ has degree $n+1$.\n\nWith $n+1$ roots at $0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, we can write:\n$$Q(x) = A \\cdot x(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-n)$$\n\nfor some constant $A$ (the leading coefficient).\n\nNow, to find $q = Q(-1)$, I can use the definition directly:\n$$Q(-1) = ((-1)+1)P(-1) - (-1) = 0 \\cdot P(-1) + 1 = 1$$\n\nTherefore, $q = 1$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nGiven:\n- $|z - 1| = 2$\n- $|z^2 - 1| = 6$\n\nLet $z = x + iy$ where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFrom the first condition:\n$$|z - 1|^2 = |(x-1) + iy|^2 = (x-1)^2 + y^2 = 4$$\n\nThis gives us:\n$$y^2 = 4 - (x-1)^2 = 3 + 2x - x^2$$\n\nFrom the second condition:\n$$z^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy$$\n$$z^2 - 1 = (x^2 - y^2 - 1) + 2ixy$$\n$$|z^2 - 1|^2 = (x^2 - y^2 - 1)^2 + 4x^2y^2 = 36$$\n\nSubstituting $y^2 = 3 + 2x - x^2$:\n$$(x^2 - (3 + 2x - x^2) - 1)^2 + 4x^2(3 + 2x - x^2) = 36$$\n$$(2x^2 - 2x - 4)^2 + 4x^2(3 + 2x - x^2) = 36$$\n\nFactoring out 4 from the first term:\n$$4(x^2 - x - 2)^2 + 4x^2(3 + 2x - x^2) = 36$$\n$$(x^2 - x - 2)^2 + x^2(3 + 2x - x^2) = 9$$\n\nExpanding $(x^2 - x - 2)^2$:\n$$x^4 - 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x + 4$$\n\nExpanding $x^2(3 + 2x - x^2)$:\n$$3x^2 + 2x^3 - x^4$$\n\nAdding these:\n$$x^4 - 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x + 4 + 3x^2 + 2x^3 - x^4 = 9$$\n$$4x + 4 = 9$$\n$$4x = 5$$\n$$x = \\frac{5}{4}$$\n\nVerification: \n- $y^2 = 3 + 2(\\frac{5}{4}) - (\\frac{5}{4})^2 = \\frac{63}{16}$\n- $(x-1)^2 + y^2 = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{63}{16} = 4$ ✓\n- $|z^2 - 1|^2 = (-\\frac{27}{8})^2 + (2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{4})^2 = \\frac{729}{64} + \\frac{1575}{64} = 36$ ✓\n\nThe real part of $z$ is $\\frac{5}{4}$.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, Q(x) is defined as (x+1)P(x) - x. When evaluated at x = -1, this gives Q(-1) = 0·P(-1) + 1 = 1. For Problem 2, using |z-1| = 2 and |z²-1| = 6 with z = x+iy, I set up equations: (x-1)² + y² = 4 and (x²-y²-1)² + 4x²y² = 36.
