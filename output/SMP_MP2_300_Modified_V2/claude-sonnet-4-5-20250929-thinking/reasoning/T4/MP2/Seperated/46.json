That is, there exists a linear map $L(x) = \\alpha x + \\beta$ such that:\n$$p(x) = L^{-1}(\\lambda L(x)^3)$$\n$$q(x) = L^{-1}(\\mu L(x)^3)$$\n\nWith $L^{-1}(y) = \\frac{y - \\beta}{\\alpha}$, we get:\n$$p(x) = \\frac{\\lambda(\\alpha x + \\beta)^3 - \\beta}{\\alpha}$$\n$$q(x) = \\frac{\\mu(\\alpha x + \\beta)^3 - \\beta}{\\alpha}$$\n\nFrom the initial conditions:\n$$p(0) = \\frac{\\lambda \\beta^3 - \\beta}{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\beta(\\lambda \\beta^2 - 1)}{\\alpha} = -24$$\n$$q(0) = \\frac{\\mu \\beta^3 - \\beta}{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\beta(\\mu \\beta^2 - 1)}{\\alpha} = 30$$\n\nLet me try $\\lambda = 1$ and $\\mu = -1$:\n$$\\frac{\\beta(\\beta^2 - 1)}{\\alpha} = -24$$\n$$\\frac{-\\beta(\\beta^2 + 1)}{\\alpha} = 30$$\n\nDividing these equations:\n$$\\frac{\\beta^2 - 1}{-(\\beta^2 + 1)} = \\frac{-24}{30} = -\\frac{4}{5}$$\n\nThis gives:\n$$5(\\beta^2 - 1) = 4(\\beta^2 + 1)$$\n$$5\\beta^2 - 5 = 4\\beta^2 + 4$$\n$$\\beta^2 = 9$$\n$$\\beta = 3$$ (taking positive value)\n\nSubstituting back:\n$$\\frac{3(9 - 1)}{\\alpha} = -24$$\n$$\\frac{24}{\\alpha} = -24$$\n$$\\alpha = -1$$\n\nVerification: $\\frac{-3(9 + 1)}{-1} = \\frac{-30}{-1} = 30$ ✓\n\nTherefore:\n$$p(x) = \\frac{(-x + 3)^3 - 3}{-1} = -((-x+3)^3 - 3) = (x-3)^3 + 3$$\n$$q(x) = \\frac{-(-x + 3)^3 - 3}{-1} = (3-x)^3 + 3$$\n\nLet me verify the initial conditions:\n- $p(0) = (-3)^3 + 3 = -27 + 3 = -24$ ✓\n- $q(0) = 3^3 + 3 = 27 + 3 = 30$ ✓\n\nNow I can calculate:\n$$p(3) = (3-3)^3 + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3$$\n$$q(6) = (3-6)^3 + 3 = (-3)^3 + 3 = -27 + 3 = -24$$\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I computed the binomial coefficient and subtracted as specified.
