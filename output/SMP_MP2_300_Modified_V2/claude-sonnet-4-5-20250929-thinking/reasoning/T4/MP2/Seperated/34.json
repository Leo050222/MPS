  "reasoning_content": "Looking at both problems, I'll solve them step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Functional Equation\n\nGiven: $f(x+y^2)=f(x)+|yf(y)|$ for all real $x, y$.\n\n**Finding $f(0)$:**\n\nSetting $x = 0$:\n$$f(y^2) = f(0) + |yf(y)|$$\n\nLet me denote $f(0) = c$.\n\nSetting $y = 1$:\n$$f(1) = f(0) + |f(1)| = c + |f(1)|$$\n\n**Case 1:** If $f(1) \\geq 0$:\n- Then $f(1) = c + f(1)$\n- This gives $c = 0$\n\n**Case 2:** If $f(1) < 0$:\n- Then $f(1) = c - f(1)$\n- This gives $c = 2f(1)$\n\nLet me check Case 2 for consistency.\n\nSetting $x = 0, y = 2$:\n$$f(4) = f(0) + |2f(2)| = c + 2|f(2)|$$\n\nSetting $x = 1, y = 1$ repeatedly:\n- $f(2) = f(1) + |f(1)|$\n- If $f(1) < 0$: $f(2) = f(1) - f(1) = 0$\n\nSo $f(2) = 0$.\n\nThen $f(4) = c + 2|0| = c = 2f(1)$ (from Case 2).\n\nSetting $x = 2, y = 1$:\n$$f(3) = f(2) + |f(1)| = 0 + |f(1)| = -f(1)$$\n\nSetting $x = 3, y = 1$:\n$$f(4) = f(3) + |f(1)| = -f(1) + (-f(1)) = -2f(1)$$\n\nBut we also have $f(4) = 2f(1)$ from above.\n\nSo $2f(1) = -2f(1)$, which gives $f(1) = 0$.\n\nThis contradicts our assumption that $f(1) < 0$.\n\nTherefore, **Case 1 must hold: $f(0) = 0$.**\n\nWe can verify that $f(x) = ax$ for $a \\geq 0$ satisfies the equation:\n- $f(x+y^2) = a(x+y^2)$\n- $f(x) + |yf(y)| = ax + |y \\cdot ay| = ax + ay^2$\n\nThese are equal when $a \\geq 0$.\n\nTherefore: $k = f(0) + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4$\n\n## Problem 2: Maximum Number of Circles\n\nWe have 7 points in the plane and want to find the maximum number of circles through sets of 4 concyclic points.\n\n**Key observations:**\n1. The total number of 4-point subsets from 7 points is $\\binom{7}{4} = 35$\n2. If 5 or more points lie on the same circle, multiple 4-point subsets lie on that circle (only counted once)\n3. To maximize the number of circles, we want to avoid having 5+ points on any single circle\n\n**Optimal configuration:**\nConsider 7 circles, where we construct a configuration such that:\n- No 5 points are concyclic\n- We maximize the number of distinct circles through 4-point subsets\n\nOne approach: Place the points such that we can construct exactly 7 distinct circles, each passing through exactly 4 of the 7 points. This can be achieved through careful geometric placement where:\n- Different combinations of 4 points lie on different circles\n- The constraint is that we avoid having 5 points on any circle\n\nThrough careful geometric construction (such as specific configurations on conics or special symmetric arrangements), the maximum of **7 circles** can be achieved.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Setting x=0 gives f(y²)=f(0)+|yf(y)|. Testing y=1 gives f(1)=f(0)+|f(1)|. If f(1)≥0, then f(0)=0. If f(1)<0, checking consistency with x=0,y=2 and iterating x=n,y=1 leads to contradiction f(1)=0. Thus f(0)=0 and k=f(0)+4=4. For Problem 2: With 7 points, we can have at most 7 distinct circles through concyclic 4-point subsets, achieved by careful geometric placement avoiding 5+ concyclic points.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n        }",
