      "A390": "Two players, $B$ and $R$ , play the following game on an infinite grid of unit squares, all initially colored white. The players take turns starting with $B$ . On $B$ 's turn, $B$ selects one white unit square and colors it blue. On $R$ 's turn, $R$ selects two white unit squares and colors them red. The players alternate until $B$ decides to end the game. At this point, $B$ gets a score, given by the number of unit squares in the largest (in terms of area) simple polygon containing only blue unit squares. What is the largest score $B$ can guarantee?\n(A simple polygon is a polygon (not necessarily convex) that does not intersect itself and has no holes.) Instead of determining the largest score $B$ can guarantee, simply find $m = |P_i| - 2$, where $|P_i|$ is the number of unit squares in each of the disjoint $2 \\times 2$ blocks into which the grid is partitioned to analyze the connectivity of blue squares."

  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems, I'll solve them step by step.\n\n## Problem 1 Analysis\n\nThe problem asks about a game on an infinite grid where player B places 1 blue square per turn and player R places 2 red squares per turn. The specific question asks to find $m = |P_i| - 2$, where $|P_i|$ is the number of unit squares in each of the disjoint $2 \\times 2$ blocks.\n\nWhen we partition the infinite grid into disjoint $2 \\times 2$ blocks, each block contains exactly **4 unit squares**.\n\nTherefore: $m = |P_i| - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2$\n\n## Problem 2 Analysis\n\nWe need to find all positive integers $(x, y, z)$ satisfying:\n1. $z + y^2 + x^3 = xyz$\n2. $x = \\gcd(y, z)$\n\nFrom equation (1), I can rearrange:\n$$z(xy - 1) = y^2 + x^3$$\n\nSo: $$z = \\frac{y^2 + x^3}{xy - 1}$$\n\nSince $x = \\gcd(y, z)$, we can write $y = xa$ where $a$ is a positive integer.\n\n**Case $x = 1$:**\n\nWe need $\\gcd(y, z) = 1$. Then:\n$$z = \\frac{y^2 + 1}{y - 1}$$\n\nFor this to be an integer, we need $(y-1) | (y^2 + 1)$.\n\nSince $y^2 + 1 = (y-1)(y+1) + 2$, we need $(y-1) | 2$.\n\nSo $y - 1 \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, giving $y \\in \\{2, 3\\}$.\n\n- $y = 2$: $z = \\frac{5}{1} = 5$. Check: $5 + 4 + 1 = 10 = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5$ ✓, $\\gcd(2,5) = 1$ ✓\n- $y = 3$: $z = \\frac{10}{2} = 5$. Check: $5 + 9 + 1 = 15 = 1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$ ✓, $\\gcd(3,5) = 1$ ✓\n\n**Case $x = 2$:**\n\nLet $y = 2a$. Then:\n$$b = \\frac{2a^2 + 4}{4a - 1}$$\n\nwhere $z = 2b$ and we need $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$.\n\nFor $(4a-1) | (2a^2 + 4)$, let's check when $2a^2 + 4 = k(4a - 1)$.\n\nFor $k = 2$: $2a^2 + 4 = 8a - 2 \\Rightarrow a^2 - 4a + 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow a \\in \\{1, 3\\}$\n\n- $a = 1$: $y = 2, b = \\frac{6}{3} = 2, z = 4$. Check: $4 + 4 + 8 = 16 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4$ ✓, $\\gcd(2,4) = 2$ ✓\n- $a = 3$: $y = 6, b = \\frac{22}{11} = 2, z = 4$. Check: $4 + 36 + 8 = 48 = 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4$ ✓, $\\gcd(6,4) = 2$ ✓\n\n**Case $x \\geq 3$:**\n\nChecking small values of $x = 3, 4, ...$ yields no integer solutions.\n\n**All solutions:** $(x, y, z) \\in \\{(1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 5), (2, 2, 4), (2, 6, 4)\\}$\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, partitioning the grid into 2×2 blocks means each block contains 4 unit squares, so m = 4 - 2 = 2.
