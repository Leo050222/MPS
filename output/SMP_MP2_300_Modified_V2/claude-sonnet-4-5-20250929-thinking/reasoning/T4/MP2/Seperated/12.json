By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule.

The game ends when no two adjacent squares are uncovered.\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\nAlice wants to maximize uncovered squares, Bob wants to minimize them. The game ends when uncovered squares form an independent set (no two adjacent).\n\n**Alice's Optimal Strategy:**\nAlice can partition the board into groups of 3 consecutive squares and ensure one square in each group remains uncovered.\n\nFor a board of length $n$:\n- When $n = 3k$, Alice can guarantee $k$ uncovered squares by strategically placing tiles\n\n**Verification for small cases:**\n- $n = 3$: Alice places on squares (1,2), leaving square 3 uncovered → 1 uncovered\n- $n = 4$: Alice places on (2,3), leaving 1 and 4 uncovered and non-adjacent → 2 uncovered  \n- $n = 6$: Alice places on (2,3), Bob places on (5,6), leaving 1 and 4 uncovered → 2 uncovered\n\n**For n = 2022:**\n$2022 = 3 \\times 674$\n\nAlice can ensure each group of 3 squares has exactly 1 uncovered square by:\n1. Placing her tiles to isolate squares within groups\n2. Responding to Bob's moves to maintain the partition structure\n\nThis guarantees **674 uncovered squares**.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, testing small values of n shows that n=4 gives a solution where all parts equal 4, satisfying both conditions. This gives k=4, so e=2025. For Problem 2, Alice can partition the 2022-square board into 674 groups of 3 squares each and use a strategic placement to ensure one uncovered square per group, guaranteeing 674 uncovered squares regardless of Bob's play.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2025\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"674\"\n}",
