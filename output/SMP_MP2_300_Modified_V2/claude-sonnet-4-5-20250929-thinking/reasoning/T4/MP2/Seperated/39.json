  "reasoning_content": "Looking at both problems, I'll solve them step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Finding prime $p$ in $a^{2013} + b^{2013} = p^n$\n\nSince 2013 is odd, I can use the factorization:\n$$a^{2013} + b^{2013} = (a+b)(a^{2012} - a^{2011}b + a^{2010}b^2 - \\cdots + b^{2012})$$\n\nLet me denote $Q(a,b) = a^{2012} - a^{2011}b + \\cdots + b^{2012}$.\n\nFor the equation $(a+b) \\cdot Q(a,b) = p^n$ to hold (where $p^n$ is a prime power), both factors must be powers of $p$ (possibly with some shared factors).\n\nLet me analyze $\\gcd(a+b, Q(a,b))$. If a prime $q$ divides both, then $a \\equiv -b \\pmod{q}$, and:\n$$Q(a,b) \\equiv 2013 \\cdot b^{2012} \\pmod{q}$$\n\nIf $q | Q(a,b)$ and $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$, then $q | 2013 = 3 \\times 11 \\times 61$.\n\n**Testing $a = b$:**\n\nIf $a = b$, then $2a^{2013} = p^n$.\n\nFor $a = 1$: $2 = p^n$, giving $p = 2, n = 1$. ✓\n\nFor $a = 2$: $2 \\cdot 2^{2013} = 2^{2014}$, giving $p = 2, n = 2014$. ✓\n\nFor $a = b = 2^k$: $2^{2013k+1} = p^n$, giving $p = 2$. ✓\n\n**Can $p$ be odd?**\n\nIf $a = b$ and $p$ is odd, then $2a^{2013} = p^n$ implies $p | a$ (since $p$ is odd and cannot divide 2). So $a = p^m$, giving $2p^{2013m} = p^n$, which means $2 = p^{n-2013m}$. This is impossible for odd $p$.\n\nFor $a \\neq b$, getting both $a+b$ and $Q(a,b)$ to be pure powers of an odd prime is extremely restrictive and doesn't yield simple solutions.\n\nTherefore, **$p = 2$** is the prime that appears in solutions.\n\n## Problem 2: Finding $n$ such that $C(2^n+1) = C(n)$\n\nLet me compute $C(2^n + 1)$ and $C(n)$ for small values of $n$:\n\n- $n = 1$: $2^1 + 1 = 3$, $C(3) = 3$, $C(1) = 0$. Not equal. ✗\n\n- $n = 2$: $2^2 + 1 = 5$, $C(5) = 5$, $C(2) = 2$. Not equal. ✗\n\n- $n = 3$: $2^3 + 1 = 9 = 3^2$, $C(9) = 3$, $C(3) = 3$. **Equal!** ✓\n\n- $n = 4$: $2^4 + 1 = 17$, $C(17) = 17$, $C(4) = 2$. Not equal. ✗\n\n- $n = 5$: $2^5 + 1 = 33 = 3 \\times 11$, $C(33) = 14$, $C(5) = 5$. Not equal. ✗\n\n- $n = 6$: $2^6 + 1 = 65 = 5 \\times 13$, $C(65) = 18$, $C(6) = 5$. Not equal. ✗\n\nFor $n = 3$ to work, we need $2^3 + 1$ to be a power of 3. Indeed, $9 = 3^2$.\n\nBy Mihăilescu's theorem (which resolved Catalan's conjecture), the equation $3^k - 2^m = 1$ has the unique non-trivial solution $(k,m) = (2,3)$.\n\nFor larger $n$, $2^n + 1$ grows exponentially and will have multiple distinct prime factors with large values, making $C(2^n + 1)$ much larger than $C(n)$.\n\nChecking a few more values confirms no other small solutions exist.\n\nTherefore, **$n = 3$** is the only solution.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I used the factorization of $a^{2013} + b^{2013}$ and analyzed when the product can be a prime power. Testing $a=b$ shows that $p=2$ works with multiple solutions. For odd primes, the constraint $2a^{2013} = p^n$ leads to contradictions. For Problem 2, I computed $C(2^n+1)$ and $C(n)$ for small values and found that only $n=3$ works, where $2^3+1=9=3^2$ and $C(9)=C(3)=3$.
