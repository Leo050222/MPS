  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems:\n\n## Problem 1: Finding d = a - 14\n\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer $a > 1$ such that there exists a positive integer $b$ satisfying $4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1$.\n\nThis can be rewritten as $(2b)^2 - 3a^2 = 1$.\n\nLet $x = 2b$. We need $x^2 - 3a^2 = 1$ where $x$ is even.\n\nThis is a Pell equation. The fundamental solution to $x^2 - 3y^2 = 1$ is $(x_1, y_1) = (2, 1)$.\n\nThe general solution is given by $(x_n, y_n)$ where:\n$$x_n + y_n\\sqrt{3} = (2 + \\sqrt{3})^n$$\n\nFor $n = 1$: $(2, 1)$ gives $x = 2$ (even), $a = 1$. But we need $a > 1$.\n\nFor $n = 2$: $(2 + \\sqrt{3})^2 = 7 + 4\\sqrt{3}$, so $(x_2, y_2) = (7, 4)$. Here $x = 7$ is odd, so this doesn't work.\n\nFor $n = 3$: $(2 + \\sqrt{3})^3 = (7 + 4\\sqrt{3})(2 + \\sqrt{3}) = 26 + 15\\sqrt{3}$, so $(x_3, y_3) = (26, 15)$.\n\nHere $x = 26$ is even, so $2b = 26$ gives $b = 13$, and $a = 15$.\n\nVerification: $4(13)^2 - 3(15)^2 = 676 - 675 = 1$ ✓\n\nTherefore, $d = a - 14 = 15 - 14 = 1$.\n\n## Problem 2: Finding P(1)/P(-1)\n\nGiven: $z^5 + 2004z = 1$, and $P(z^2) = 0$ for such $z$.\n\nLet $w = z^2$. From $z^5 + 2004z = 1$:\n$$z^5 = z \\cdot z^4 = z \\cdot w^2$$\n\nSo: $w^2z + 2004z = 1$, which gives $z(w^2 + 2004) = 1$.\n\nTherefore: $z = \\frac{1}{w^2 + 2004}$\n\nSince $w = z^2$:\n$$w = \\frac{1}{(w^2 + 2004)^2}$$\n\nCross-multiplying: $w(w^2 + 2004)^2 = 1$\n\nExpanding:\n$$w(w^4 + 4008w^2 + 2004^2) = 1$$\n$$w^5 + 4008w^3 + 4016016w = 1$$\n\nTherefore: $P(w) = w^5 + 4008w^3 + 4016016w - 1$\n\nComputing $P(1)$:\n$$P(1) = 1 + 4008 + 4016016 - 1 = 4020024$$\n\nNote that $4020024 = 2005^2 - 1 = (2005-1)(2005+1) = 2004 \\times 2006$\n\nComputing $P(-1)$:\n$$P(-1) = -1 - 4008 - 4016016 - 1 = -4020026$$\n\nNote that $4020026 = 2005^2 + 1$\n\nTherefore:\n$$\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \\frac{4020024}{-4020026} = \\frac{2005^2 - 1}{-(2005^2 + 1)} = -\\frac{4020024}{4020026}$$\n\nSimplifying by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n$$\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = -\\frac{2010012}{2010013}$$\n\nSince these are consecutive integers, $\\gcd(2010012, 2010013) = 1$, so this is in simplest form.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I solved the Pell equation 4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1 by converting it to x^2 - 3a^2 = 1 with x = 2b (even), finding the third solution (26, 15) which gives a = 15, so d = 15 - 14 = 1. For Problem 2, I derived P(w) = w^5 + 4008w^3 + 4016016w - 1 by substituting w = z^2 into z^5 + 2004z = 1, then calculated P(1) = 2005^2 - 1 and P(-1) = -(2005^2 + 1), giving the ratio -2010012/2010013 in simplest form.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-2010012/2010013\"\n}",
