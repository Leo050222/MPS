  "math_problem": "Alice draws three cards from a standard 52-card deck with replacement. Ace through 10 are worth 1 to 10 points respectively, and the face cards King, Queen, and Jack are each worth 10 points. The probability that the sum of the point values of the cards drawn is a multiple of 10 can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing a hundred times the numerator plus the denominator of the fraction representing the probability in lowest terms, simply find $k = d + 0$, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that probability fraction. Suppose $P(x)$ is a polynomial such that $P(k)=k$ and $$\\frac{P(2 x)}{P(x+1)}=8-\\frac{56}{x+7}$$ for all real $x$ for which both sides are defined. Find $P(-k)$.",
