  "math_problem": "Let $f(x)=x^{2}-2$, and let $f^{n}$ denote the function $f$ applied $n$ times. Consider the sequence $(L_n)$ defined by $L_0 = 2$, $L_1 = 1$, and $L_{n+2} = L_{n+1} + L_n$ for $n \\geq 0$. Compute the remainder when $f^{24}(18)$ is divided by 89. Instead of determining the value modulo the given prime of the result of iterating the quadratic function the specified number of times starting from the given initial value, simply find $d = L_8 - 42$, where $L_8$ is the eighth term of the sequence $(L_n)$ defined in the problem. How many polynomials of degree exactly $d$ with real coefficients send the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ to a permutation of itself?",
