  "math_problem": "Jude repeatedly flips a coin. If he has already flipped $n$ heads, the coin lands heads with probability $\\frac{1}{n+2}$ and tails with probability $\\frac{n+1}{n+2}$. If Jude continues flipping forever, let $p$ be the probability that he flips 3 heads in a row at some point. Compute $\\lfloor 180 p \\rfloor$. Instead of computing the floor of 180 times the probability of eventually flipping three heads in a row, simply find $\\delta = p_5 - \\frac{53}{72}$, where $p_5$ is the probability that the fifth head is preceded by a tail and that no three consecutive heads have occurred in the sequence up to the fifth head, as derived from analyzing the process to avoid three consecutive heads. Compute the number of ways a non-self-intersecting concave quadrilateral can be drawn in the plane such that two of its vertices are $(\\delta, \\delta)$ and $(1, \\delta)$, and the other two vertices are two distinct lattice points $(a, b),(c, d)$ with $\\delta \\leq a, c \\leq (\\delta + 59)$ and $(\\delta + 1) \\leq b, d \\leq (\\delta + 5)$.",

The concavity condition is satisfied when one interior angle exceeds 180°, which occurs for appropriate orderings of the four vertices.\n\nAll valid orderings of the four points that create non-self-intersecting quadrilaterals with the required concavity can be counted, and the total is:\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I computed δ by analyzing the Markov chain for the coin-flipping process. Computing flows through states (h,s) where h is heads count and s is streak length, I found f_{4,0} = 53/12, leading to f_{5,1} = 53/72. Thus δ = 0. For the geometry problem with δ = 0, I have vertices at (0,0) and (1,0), with two other points from the 60×5 = 300 lattice points in [0,59]×[1,5].
