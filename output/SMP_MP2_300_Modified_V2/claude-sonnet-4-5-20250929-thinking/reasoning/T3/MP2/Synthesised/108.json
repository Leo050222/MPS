  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be square with 4 digits, such that all its digits are less than 6. If we add 1 to each digit the resulting number is another square. Find $n$ Instead of identifying the 4-digit perfect square satisfying the digit increment condition, simply find $m = a - 42$, where $a$ is the integer whose square is that number. P is a polynomial. When P is divided by $x-1$, the remainder is -4 . When P is divided by $x-2$, the remainder is -1 . When $P$ is divided by $x-3$, the remainder is 4 . Determine the remainder when $P$ is divided by $x^{m}-6 x^{2}+11 x-6$.",
  "reasoning_content": "## Problem Solution\n\n### Part 1: Finding m\n\nI need to find a 4-digit perfect square $n = a^2$ where:\n- All digits are less than 6 (digits can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n- Adding 1 to each digit gives another perfect square\n\nTesting 4-digit squares systematically:\n\nFor $a = 45$:\n- $45^2 = 2025$\n- Digits are 2, 0, 2, 5 (all less than 6) ✓\n- Adding 1 to each digit: 2→3, 0→1, 2→3, 5→6 gives 3136\n- Check: $56^2 = 3136$ ✓\n\nTherefore, $a = 45$ and $m = a - 42 = 45 - 42 = 3$.\n\n### Part 2: Finding the Remainder\n\nNow I need to find the remainder when $P$ is divided by $x^m - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6$.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the divisor**\n\nTesting $x = 1$: $1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0$, so $(x-1)$ is a factor.\n\nDividing: $x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = (x-1)(x^2 - 5x + 6) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$\n\n**Step 2: Use the Remainder Theorem**\n\nGiven:\n- $P(1) = -4$ (remainder when divided by $x-1$)\n- $P(2) = -1$ (remainder when divided by $x-2$)\n- $P(3) = 4$ (remainder when divided by $x-3$)\n\nThe remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$ must be a polynomial $R(x)$ of degree at most 2.\n\nLet $R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$.\n\n**Step 3: Set up equations**\n\nFrom the conditions:\n- $R(1) = a + b + c = -4$\n- $R(2) = 4a + 2b + c = -1$\n- $R(3) = 9a + 3b + c = 4$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the system**\n\nFrom equation 2 - equation 1: $3a + b = 3$\nFrom equation 3 - equation 2: $5a + b = 5$\n\nSubtracting: $2a = 2$, so $a = 1$\n\nThen: $b = 3 - 3(1) = 0$\n\nAnd: $c = -4 - 1 - 0 = -5$\n\nTherefore: $R(x) = x^2 - 5$\n\n**Verification:**\n- $R(1) = 1 - 5 = -4$ ✓\n- $R(2) = 4 - 5 = -1$ ✓\n- $R(3) = 9 - 5 = 4$ ✓\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found the 4-digit perfect square n = 2025 = 45^2 where all digits are less than 6. Adding 1 to each digit gives 3136 = 56^2. Thus a = 45 and m = 45 - 42 = 3. Then I needed to find the remainder when P is divided by x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6, which factors as (x-1)(x-2)(x-3). Using the given conditions P(1) = -4, P(2) = -1, P(3) = 4, I found the unique polynomial of degree at most 2 satisfying these conditions: R(x) = x^2 - 5.\",\n    \"answer\": \"x^2 - 5\"\n}\n```",
