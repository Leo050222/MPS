  "math_problem": "In a $k \\times k$ chessboard, a set $S$ of 25 cells that are in a $5 \\times 5$ square is chosen uniformly at random. The probability that there are more black squares than white squares in $S$ is $48\\%$. Find $k$. Instead of determining the dimension of the board, simply find $b = n - 3$, where $n$ is the number of possible starting positions along one dimension for the subsquare derived from the positional analysis of the board. Find all ordered pairs of integers $(x, y)$ such that $3^{x} 4^{y}=b^{x+y}+b^{2(x+y)-1}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to work through two main parts: finding $b$ from the chessboard problem, then solving for the ordered pairs.\n\n## Part 1: Finding $b$\n\n**Chessboard Analysis:**\nIn a $k \\times k$ chessboard, a $5 \\times 5$ square can be placed at $(k-4)^2$ different positions (the top-left corner can be at positions $(i,j)$ where $1 \\leq i,j \\leq k-4$).\n\nFor a $5 \\times 5$ square on a standard chessboard:\n- If the top-left corner is on a black square: 13 black, 12 white\n- If the top-left corner is on a white square: 12 black, 13 white\n\nLet $n = k-4$ be the number of possible starting positions along one dimension.\n\nAssuming position $(1,1)$ is white, then $(i,j)$ is black if $i+j$ is odd. We want more black squares, which occurs when $i+j$ is odd.\n\nFor $n$ odd, let $n = 2m+1$:\n- Number of positions with $i+j$ odd: $(m+1) \\cdot m + m \\cdot (m+1) = 2m(m+1)$\n- Total positions: $(2m+1)^2$\n- Probability: $\\frac{2m(m+1)}{(2m+1)^2} = 0.48 = \\frac{12}{25}$\n\nSetting up the equation:\n$$\\frac{2m(m+1)}{(2m+1)^2} = \\frac{12}{25}$$\n\nCross-multiplying:\n$$25 \\cdot 2m(m+1) = 12(2m+1)^2$$\n$$50m^2 + 50m = 48m^2 + 48m + 12$$\n$$2m^2 + 2m = 12$$\n$$m^2 + m - 6 = 0$$\n$$(m+3)(m-2) = 0$$\n\nTaking $m = 2$ (positive solution), we get $n = 2(2) + 1 = 5$.\n\nTherefore: $b = n - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2$\n\n## Part 2: Finding ordered pairs $(x,y)$\n\nWith $b = 2$, we need to solve:\n$$3^x \\cdot 4^y = 2^{x+y} + 2^{2(x+y)-1}$$\n\nLet $s = x+y$. Then:\n$$3^x \\cdot 2^{2y} = 2^s + 2^{2s-1} = 2^s(1 + 2^{s-1})$$\n\nFor various values of $s$:\n\n**For $s = 1$:** RHS = $2(1+1) = 4$\n- Testing $(x,y) = (0,1)$: $3^0 \\cdot 4^1 = 4$ ✓\n\n**For $s = 2$:** RHS = $4(1+2) = 12$\n- Testing $(x,y) = (1,1)$: $3^1 \\cdot 4^1 = 12$ ✓\n\n**For $s = 3$:** RHS = $8(1+4) = 40$\n- $(0,3)$: $1 \\cdot 64 = 64$ ✗\n- $(1,2)$: $3 \\cdot 16 = 48$ ✗\n- $(2,1)$: $9 \\cdot 4 = 36$ ✗\n- $(3,0)$: $27 \\cdot 1 = 27$ ✗\n\n**For $s = 4$:** RHS = $16(1+8) = 144$\n- Testing $(x,y) = (2,2)$: $3^2 \\cdot 4^2 = 9 \\cdot 16 = 144$ ✓\n\n**For $s = 5$:** RHS = $32(1+16) = 544$\n- Testing all combinations yields no integer solutions\n\nFor larger values of $s$ or negative values, no additional integer solutions exist.\n\nThe ordered pairs are: $(0,1), (1,1), (2,2)$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I solved the chessboard problem to find that n=5 (positions along one dimension) and thus b=n-3=2.
