  "math_problem": "Let $p(m)=m^5-5m^3+4m$. Find the largest integer that divides $p(m)$ for all integers $m\\geq 5$. Instead of determining the largest positive integer dividing the polynomial's values at all integers greater than or equal to five, simply find $k=p(10)-95037$, where $p(m)$ is the given quintic polynomial. Find all pairs of integer solutions $(n, m)$ to $2^{3^{n}}=k^{2^{m}}-1$.",

This is also a valid solution but not covered by Mihăilescu's theorem (which requires $p, q > 1$).\n\nFor any other combination with $n = 0, m \\geq 1$ or $n \\geq 1, m = 0$, we can verify there are no solutions by direct substitution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only integer solutions are $(n, m) = (0, 0)$ and $(n, m) = (1, 1)$.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I calculated p(10) = 10^5 - 5(10^3) + 4(10) = 95040, so k = 95040 - 95037 = 3.

For n≥2, the equation has no solutions by Mihăilescu's theorem (proof of Catalan's conjecture), which states that 3^2 - 2^3 = 1 is the only solution to x^p - y^q = 1 with x,y,p,q > 1.
