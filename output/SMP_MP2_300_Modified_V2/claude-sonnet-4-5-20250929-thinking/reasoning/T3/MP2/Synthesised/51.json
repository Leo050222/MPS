  "math_problem": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form. Determine all the roots, real or complex, of the system of simultaneous equations $x + y + z = m$, $x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = m$, $x^{m} + y^{m} + z^{m} = m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to work through several steps:\n\n## Step 1: Find the probability p\n\nStarting with 2015 rocks (which is 5 × 403), I need to find the probability that after each round, the number of rocks remains a multiple of 5.\n\nLet $Q(n)$ be the probability of reaching 0 with all intermediate values being multiples of 5, starting from $5n$ rocks.\n\nFor $n \\geq 1$: $Q(n) = \\frac{1}{5n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} Q(i)$\n\nWith $Q(0) = 1$.\n\nLet $S_n = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} Q(i)$. Then:\n- $Q(n) = \\frac{S_n}{5n}$\n- $S_{n+1} = S_n(1 + \\frac{1}{5n}) = S_n \\cdot \\frac{5n+1}{5n}$\n\nTherefore: $S_n = \\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{5k+1}{5k}$\n\nAnd: $Q(n) = \\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}(5k+1)}{5^n \\cdot n!}$\n\nFor $n = 403$: $p = Q(403) = \\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^{402}(5k+1)}{5^{403} \\cdot 403!}$\n\n## Step 2: Find the exponent b of 31\n\nIn the numerator, I need $5k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{31}$, which gives $k \\equiv 6 \\pmod{31}$.\n\nFor $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 402\\}$: $k = 6, 37, 68, 99, ..., 378$\n\nThis gives $\\lfloor\\frac{402-6}{31}\\rfloor + 1 = 13$ values.\n\nIn the denominator, the exponent of 31 in $403!$ is:\n$\\lfloor\\frac{403}{31}\\rfloor + \\lfloor\\frac{403}{961}\\rfloor + \\cdots = 13 + 0 + \\cdots = 13$\n\nTherefore: $b = 13 - 13 = 0$\n\n## Step 3: Find m\n\n$m = b + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2$\n\n## Step 4: Solve the system with m = 2\n\nThe system becomes:\n- $x + y + z = 2$\n- $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2$  \n- $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2$ (since $m=2$)\n\nFrom the first two equations:\n$(x+y+z)^2 = 4 = x^2+y^2+z^2 + 2(xy+yz+zx) = 2 + 2(xy+yz+zx)$\n\nSo $xy + yz + zx = 1$\n\nTo find specific solutions, I'll try cases where two variables are equal.\n\n**Case 1:** Let $x = y$. Then $2x + z = 2$ and $2x^2 + z^2 = 2$.\n\nSubstituting $z = 2-2x$:\n$2x^2 + (2-2x)^2 = 2$\n$2x^2 + 4 - 8x + 4x^2 = 2$\n$6x^2 - 8x + 2 = 0$\n$3x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0$\n$(3x-1)(x-1) = 0$\n\nSo $x = \\frac{1}{3}$ or $x = 1$.\n\n- If $x = y = 1$: $z = 0$ → Solution: $(1, 1, 0)$\n- If $x = y = \\frac{1}{3}$: $z = \\frac{4}{3}$ → Solution: $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{4}{3})$\n\nBy symmetry, all permutations are solutions:\n- Permutations of $(1, 1, 0)$: $(1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1)$\n- Permutations of $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{4}{3})$: $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{4}{3}), (\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}), (\\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$\n\nThese are all the \"distinguished\" real solutions on the solution curve.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding probability p, expressing it in a specific form to find b, then m = b+2 = 2, and finally solving a system of equations with m=2. The system reduces to two independent equations with three unknowns, giving a one-parameter family of solutions.
