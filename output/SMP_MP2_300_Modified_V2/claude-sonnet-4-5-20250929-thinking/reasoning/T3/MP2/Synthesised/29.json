  "math_problem": "I have 8 unit cubes of different colors, which I want to glue together into a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ cube. How many distinct $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ cubes can I make? Rotations of the same cube are not considered distinct, but reflections are. Instead of determining the number of distinct cubes up to rotations, simply find $k = m - 34$, where $m$ is the number of ways to choose which of the remaining cubes occupy the positions adjacent to the fixed cube, derived from the analysis of fixing one cube's position to account for rotational symmetry. Find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial $P(x)=x^{4}-(k + 28) x^{3}+a x^{2}+b x+c$, given that $P(5)=(k + 10), P(11)=(k + 16)$, and $P(17)=(k + 22)$.",

Using the three given conditions P(5)=186, P(11)=192, P(17)=198, we set up a system of three equations with three unknowns. Solving this system yields a = 5970, b = -56851, c = 160066.
