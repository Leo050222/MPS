  "math_problem": "The country of HMMTLand has 8 cities. Its government decides to construct several two-way roads between pairs of distinct cities. After they finish construction, it turns out that each city can reach exactly 3 other cities via a single road, and from any pair of distinct cities, either exactly 0 or 2 other cities can be reached from both cities by a single road. Compute the number of ways HMMTLand could have constructed the roads. Instead of computing the total number of possible road constructions satisfying the conditions, simply find $N$, where $N$ is the number of connected road constructions satisfying the conditions. A real number $x$ is chosen uniformly at random from the interval $(0,10)$. Compute the probability that $\\sqrt{x}$, $\\sqrt{x+(N-833)}$, and $\\sqrt{10-x}$ are the side lengths of a non-degenerate triangle.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve two parts: first find N (the number of connected road constructions), then use it to compute a probability.\n\n## Part 1: Finding N\n\nI need to find connected graphs on 8 vertices where:\n- Each vertex has degree 3 (regular graph)\n- Any two distinct vertices have exactly 0 or 2 common neighbors\n\nLet me consider the 3-dimensional hypercube graph $Q_3$. \n\n**Vertices of $Q_3$:** Label vertices as 3-bit binary strings: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111\n\n**Edges:** Two vertices are adjacent iff they differ in exactly one bit\n\n**Checking common neighbors:**\n\nFor adjacent vertices (differ in 1 bit):\n- Example: 000 and 001\n- Neighbors of 000: {001, 010, 100}\n- Neighbors of 001: {000, 011, 101}\n- Common neighbors: ∅ (0 common neighbors) ✓\n\nFor non-adjacent vertices:\n- If they differ in 2 bits (e.g., 000 and 011):\n  - Neighbors of 000: {001, 010, 100}\n  - Neighbors of 011: {001, 010, 111}\n  - Common neighbors: {001, 010} (2 common neighbors) ✓\n  \n- If they differ in 3 bits (e.g., 000 and 111):\n  - No common neighbors (0 common neighbors) ✓\n\nSo $Q_3$ satisfies all conditions!\n\n**Counting labeled graphs:**\nThe automorphism group of $Q_3$ has order 48 (it's the symmetry group of a cube).\n\nNumber of ways to label $Q_3$ with 8 distinct cities: $N = \\frac{8!}{48} = \\frac{40320}{48} = 840$\n\n## Part 2: Computing the Probability\n\nWith $N = 840$, we have $N - 833 = 7$.\n\nThe three side lengths are:\n- $a = \\sqrt{x}$\n- $b = \\sqrt{x + 7}$  \n- $c = \\sqrt{10 - x}$\n\nwhere $x \\in (0, 10)$.\n\n**Triangle inequalities:**\n\n**Condition 1:** $\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{10-x} > \\sqrt{x+7}$\n\nSquaring: $x + 10 - x + 2\\sqrt{x(10-x)} > x + 7$\n\nThis gives: $2\\sqrt{x(10-x)} > x - 3$\n\n- If $x \\leq 3$: automatically satisfied\n- If $x > 3$: squaring gives $4x(10-x) > (x-3)^2$\n  - $40x - 4x^2 > x^2 - 6x + 9$\n  - $5x^2 - 46x + 9 < 0$\n  - Roots: $x = \\frac{46 \\pm 44}{10}$, so $x = 9$ or $x = 0.2$\n  - This holds for $0.2 < x < 9$\n\nCombined: Condition 1 requires $x < 9$\n\n**Condition 2:** $\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{x+7} > \\sqrt{10-x}$\n\nSquaring: $2x + 7 + 2\\sqrt{x(x+7)} > 10 - x$\n\nThis gives: $3x - 3 + 2\\sqrt{x(x+7)} > 0$\n\n- If $x \\geq 1$: automatically satisfied\n- If $x < 1$: need $2\\sqrt{x(x+7)} > 3 - 3x$\n  - Squaring: $4x(x+7) > 9 - 18x + 9x^2$\n  - $5x^2 - 46x + 9 < 0$\n  - This holds for $0.2 < x < 9$\n\nCombined: Condition 2 requires $x > 0.2$\n\n**Condition 3:** $\\sqrt{10-x} + \\sqrt{x+7} > \\sqrt{x}$\n\nThis is always satisfied for $x \\in (0, 10)$ since both terms on the left are positive.\n\n**Final answer:**\nAll conditions are satisfied when $0.2 < x < 9$.\n\nProbability = $\\frac{9 - 0.2}{10 - 0} = \\frac{8.8}{10} = \\frac{22}{25}$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I identified that the graph structure is the 3-dimensional hypercube Q_3, which has 840 labeled versions.
