  "math_problem": "For a given positive integer $n$, we define $\\varphi(n)$ to be the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ which share no common prime factors with $n$. Find all positive integers $n$ for which $\\varphi(2019 n)=\\varphi\\left(n^{2}\\right)$. Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ for which $\\varphi(2019 n)=\\varphi(n^2)$, simply find $k=\\gcd(2019,n)-2018$, where $n$ is the positive integer solution that is a multiple of $2019$. The sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$ of real numbers satisfies the recurrence $a_{n+1}=\\frac{a_{n}^{2}-a_{n-1}+2 a_{n}}{a_{n-1}+k}$. Given that $a_{1}=k$ and $a_{9}=(k + 6)$, find $a_{5}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve it in two parts:\n\n## Part 1: Finding k\n\nFirst, let me find $k = \\gcd(2019, n) - 2018$ where $n$ is a positive integer multiple of 2019 satisfying $\\varphi(2019n) = \\varphi(n^2)$.\n\n**Factoring 2019:**\n$2019 = 3 \\times 673$\n\n**Finding n:**\nSince $n$ is a multiple of 2019, let $n = 2019m$ for some positive integer $m$.\n\nFor the general case, let $n = 3^a \\cdot 673^b \\cdot m$ where $\\gcd(m, 2019) = 1$.\n\nThen:\n- $2019n = 3^{a+1} \\cdot 673^{b+1} \\cdot m$\n- $\\varphi(2019n) = 3^a \\cdot 2 \\cdot 673^b \\cdot 672 \\cdot \\varphi(m)$\n\nAnd:\n- $n^2 = 3^{2a} \\cdot 673^{2b} \\cdot m^2$\n- $\\varphi(n^2) = 3^{2a-1} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 673^{2b-1} \\cdot 672 \\cdot m \\cdot \\varphi(m)$\n\nSetting them equal and simplifying:\n$$3^a \\cdot 673^b = 3^{2a-1} \\cdot 673^{2b-1} \\cdot m$$\n\nThis gives:\n$$m = 3^{1-a} \\cdot 673^{1-b}$$\n\nFor $m$ to be a positive integer with $\\gcd(m, 2019) = 1$, and for $n$ to be a multiple of 2019 (requiring $a \\geq 1$ and $b \\geq 1$), we must have $a = 1$ and $b = 1$.\n\nThis gives $m = 1$, so $n = 2019$.\n\nTherefore:\n$$k = \\gcd(2019, 2019) - 2018 = 2019 - 2018 = 1$$\n\n## Part 2: Solving the Recurrence\n\nWith $k = 1$, the recurrence becomes:\n$$a_{n+1} = \\frac{a_n^2 - a_{n-1} + 2a_n}{a_{n-1} + 1}$$\n\nGiven:\n- $a_1 = k = 1$\n- $a_9 = k + 6 = 7$\n\nFor a linear sequence $a_n = An + B$:\n- From $a_1 = 1$: $A + B = 1$\n- From $a_9 = 7$: $9A + B = 7$\n\nSolving: $8A = 6$, so $A = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $B = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThis gives $a_n = \\frac{3n + 1}{4}$\n\nVerification:\n- $a_1 = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$ ✓\n- $a_9 = \\frac{28}{4} = 7$ ✓\n\nTherefore:\n$$a_5 = \\frac{3(5) + 1}{4} = \\frac{16}{4} = 4$$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found that k = gcd(2019, n) - 2018 where n = 2019 is the solution to φ(2019n) = φ(n²). Since 2019 = 3 × 673, and analyzing the totient function properties, I determined that n = 2019 is the only multiple of 2019 satisfying the condition, giving k = 1. Then, using the recurrence relation with k = 1, a₁ = 1, and a₉ = 7, I found that a linear sequence a_n = (3n + 1)/4 satisfies these boundary conditions, yielding a₅ = 4.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4\"\n}",
