  "math_problem": "Find the number of subsets $S$ of $\\{1,2, \\ldots 6\\}$ satisfying the following conditions: - $S$ is non-empty. - No subset of $S$ has the property that the sum of its elements is 10. Instead of finding the total number of such subsets, simply find $k = N_5 - 8$, where $N_5$ is the number of non-empty subsets whose largest element is 5 and that satisfy the given condition. Find the number of ordered triples of nonnegative integers $(a, b, c)$ that satisfy $(ab+k)(bc+k)(ca+k)=(k + 83)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to first find $k = N_5 - 8$, where $N_5$ is the number of non-empty subsets whose largest element is 5 and satisfy the given condition.\n\n## Finding $N_5$\n\nIf the largest element is 5, then the subset must contain 5 and cannot contain 6. So I'm looking at subsets of the form $S = \\{5\\} \\cup T$ where $T \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nThe condition is that no subset of $S$ should have sum equal to 10.\n\n**Finding which combinations sum to 10:**\n- $\\{5, 1, 4\\}$ sums to 10\n- $\\{5, 2, 3\\}$ sums to 10  \n- $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ sums to 10\n\n**Constraints on $T$:**\n- $T$ cannot contain both 1 and 4\n- $T$ cannot contain both 2 and 3\n- (The constraint that $T \\neq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ is implied by the first two)\n\n**Counting valid subsets $T$:**\n- Total subsets of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$: $2^4 = 16$\n- Subsets containing both 1 and 4: $2^2 = 4$\n- Subsets containing both 2 and 3: $2^2 = 4$\n- Subsets containing both pairs: 1 (just $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$)\n\nBy inclusion-exclusion: Invalid subsets = $4 + 4 - 1 = 7$\n\nValid subsets: $N_5 = 16 - 7 = 9$\n\nTherefore: $k = 9 - 8 = 1$\n\n## Solving $(ab+1)(bc+1)(ca+1) = 84$\n\nWith $k=1$, I need to find ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ of nonnegative integers satisfying:\n$(ab+1)(bc+1)(ca+1) = 84$\n\nLet $x = ab+1$, $y = bc+1$, $z = ca+1$ where $x,y,z \\geq 1$ and $xyz = 84$.\n\n**Case 1: One variable equals 0**\n\nIf $a = 0$: Then $x = z = 1$, so $y = 84$, giving $bc = 83$. Since 83 is prime: $(b,c) \\in \\{(1,83), (83,1)\\}$\n- Solutions: $(0,1,83)$, $(0,83,1)$\n\nIf $b = 0$: Then $x = y = 1$, so $z = 84$, giving $ca = 83$\n- Solutions: $(83,0,1)$, $(1,0,83)$\n\nIf $c = 0$: Then $y = z = 1$, so $x = 84$, giving $ab = 83$\n- Solutions: $(1,83,0)$, $(83,1,0)$\n\nThis gives 6 solutions.\n\n**Case 2: All variables positive**\n\nFor $a,b,c > 0$, we have $(abc)^2 = (ab)(bc)(ca) = (x-1)(y-1)(z-1)$\n\nSo $(x-1)(y-1)(z-1)$ must be a perfect square.\n\nChecking factorizations of 84:\n- $(x,y,z) = (3,4,7)$: $(x-1)(y-1)(z-1) = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6 = 36 = 6^2$ ✓\n\nFor $(ab,bc,ca) = (2,3,6)$ (corresponding to one permutation of $(3,4,7)$):\n- From $abc = 6$, $ab = 2$: we get $c = 3$\n- From $bc = 3$, $c = 3$: we get $b = 1$  \n- From $ab = 2$, $b = 1$: we get $a = 2$\n\nChecking all 6 permutations of $(3,4,7)$:\n- $(2,1,3)$, $(1,2,3)$, $(3,1,2)$, $(1,3,2)$, $(3,2,1)$, $(2,3,1)$\n\nThis gives 6 more solutions.\n\n**Total: $6 + 6 = 12$ solutions**\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found N_5 = 9 by counting subsets with largest element 5 that don't have any subset summing to 10.
