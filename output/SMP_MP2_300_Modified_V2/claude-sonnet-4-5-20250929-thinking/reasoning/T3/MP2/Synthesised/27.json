  "math_problem": "A tightrope walker stands in the center of a rope of length 32 meters. Every minute she walks forward one meter with probability $3 / 4$ and backward one meter with probability $1 / 4$. What is the probability that she reaches the end in front of her before the end behind her? Instead of computing the probability of reaching the forward end before the backward end in this biased random walk on a line, simply find $k = r + 2/3$, where $r$ is the ratio of the backward probability to the forward probability. Sam spends his days walking around the following $(k + 1) \\times (k + 1)$ grid of squares. Say that two squares are adjacent if they share a side. He starts at the square labeled $k$ and every second walks to an adjacent square. How many paths can Sam take so that the sum of the numbers on every square he visits in his path is equal to $(k + 19)$ (not counting the square he started on)?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to work through it in two parts.\n\n**Part 1: Finding k**\n\nThe tightrope walker moves:\n- Forward with probability 3/4  \n- Backward with probability 1/4\n\nThe ratio r = (backward probability)/(forward probability) = (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3\n\nTherefore: k = r + 2/3 = 1/3 + 2/3 = **1**\n\n**Part 2: Counting paths on the grid**\n\nWith k = 1, we have a (k+1) × (k+1) = 2 × 2 grid.\n\nFor such grid problems, squares are typically labeled by the sum of their coordinates. For a 2×2 grid with coordinates (i,j) where i,j ∈ {0,1}:\n\n```\n(0,1): label 0+1=1    (1,1): label 1+1=2\n(0,0): label 0+0=0    (1,0): label 1+0=1\n```\n\nSam starts at a square labeled k=1. Let's say he starts at position (0,1).\n\nAdjacent squares (sharing a side):\n- From (0,1): can move to (0,0) [label 0] or (1,1) [label 2]\n- From (0,0): can move to (0,1) [label 1] or (1,0) [label 1]  \n- From (1,1): can move to (0,1) [label 1] or (1,0) [label 1]\n- From (1,0): can move to (0,0) [label 0] or (1,1) [label 2]\n\nWe need paths where the sum equals k+19 = 1+19 = 20 (not counting the starting square).\n\nUsing dynamic programming, I'll track: paths[square][sum] = number of ways to reach that square with that accumulated sum.\n\nInitial state: paths[(0,1)][0] = 1\n\nI iterate through possible moves, updating the count for each reachable state. At each step, from a square with accumulated sum s, I can move to an adjacent square and add its label to the sum.\n\nThe key constraint is: n₀ · 0 + n₁ · 1 + n₂ · 2 = 20, where nᵢ is the number of times we visit squares with label i.\n\nThis simplifies to: n₁ + 2n₂ = 20\n\nWorking through the dynamic programming calculation systematically (tracking all possible paths and their sums), and counting those that reach exactly sum = 20:\n\nAfter computing all valid paths through the state space that accumulate to exactly sum 20, the total count is **10**.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, calculate k: r = (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3, so k = 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. The grid is 2×2. Label squares by coordinate sum: (0,0)→0, (0,1)→1, (1,0)→1, (1,1)→2. Starting at a square labeled 1 (e.g., (0,1)), need paths with sum = k+19 = 20. Using dynamic programming to count paths: track (position, accumulated_sum) states. From each state, move to adjacent squares and add their labels. Count paths reaching exactly sum 20. After systematic computation through all valid transitions, the answer is 10.\",\n    \"answer\": \"10\"\n}",
