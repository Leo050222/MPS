  "math_problem": "Let $Q(x)=x^{2}+2x+3$, and suppose that $P(x)$ is a polynomial such that $P(Q(x))=x^{6}+6x^{5}+18x^{4}+32x^{3}+35x^{2}+22x+8$. Compute $P(2)$. Instead of computing $P(2)$, simply find $k = Q(r) - 1$, where $r$ is the unique real root of the derivative of $Q$.

  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to find $k = Q(r) - 1$ where $r$ is the unique real root of $Q'(x)$, then answer the question about the existence of an irrational number.\n\n## Step 1: Find the derivative of Q(x) and its root\n\nGiven $Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3$\n\nTaking the derivative:\n$$Q'(x) = 2x + 2$$\n\nSetting $Q'(x) = 0$:\n$$2x + 2 = 0$$\n$$x = -1$$\n\nSo $r = -1$ is the unique real root of $Q'(x)$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate k\n\nNow I compute $k = Q(r) - 1$:\n$$Q(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$k = Q(-1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$$\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the existence question\n\nWith $k = 1$, the question becomes: Does there exist an irrational number $\\alpha > 1$ such that:\n$$\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$$\nfor all integers $n \\geq 1$?\n\n(Since $k - 1 = 0$ and $k + 2016 = 2017$)\n\n## Step 4: Determine the answer\n\nFor this condition to hold, we need:\n- $\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\rfloor = 2017m_n$ for some integer $m_n$ for every $n \\geq 1$\n\nThis means:\n$$2017m_n \\leq \\alpha^n < 2017m_n + 1$$\n\nThe fractional part of $\\alpha^n/2017$ must always lie in $[0, 1/2017)$.\n\nFor $n = 1$: If $\\alpha > 1$, then $\\lfloor \\alpha \\rfloor$ must be divisible by 2017, so $\\alpha \\in [2017, 2018)$ at minimum.\n\nFor $n = 2$: If $\\alpha \\approx 2017$, then $\\alpha^2 \\approx 2017^2 = 4,068,289$.

Then Q(-1) = 2, so k = Q(r) - 1 = 1. The question asks if there exists an irrational α > 1 such that ⌊α^n⌋ ≡ 0 (mod 2017) for all n ≥ 1. This would require the fractional part of α^n/2017 to always be in [0, 1/2017), which is inconsistent with equidistribution properties of exponential sequences with irrational bases. Therefore, no such irrational number exists.\",\n    \"answer\": \"No\"\n}",
