  "math_problem": "Tetrahedron $A B C D$ has side lengths $A B=6, B D=6 \\sqrt{2}, B C=10, A C=8, C D=10$, and $A D=6$. The distance from vertex $A$ to face $B C D$ can be written as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are positive integers, $b$ is square-free, and $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$. Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of computing the encoded value $100a + 10b + c$ from the parameters of the distance expression, simply find $d = \\gcd(a, c) + 0$, where $a, b, c$ are the positive integers such that the distance is $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$ with $b$ square-free and $\\gcd(a, c)=1$. Find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(x, y)$ with $x, y \\leq 2020$ such that $(k + 2) x^{2}+10 x y+(k + 2) y^{2}$ is the power of some prime $p^k$ for integer $k \\geq d$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Find the distance from vertex A to face BCD\n2. Determine the value of d\n3. Count ordered pairs satisfying the given condition\n\n## Step 1: Finding the distance from A to face BCD\n\nLet me set up coordinates with B at the origin.\n\n**Setting up coordinates:**\n- $B = (0, 0, 0)$\n- $C = (10, 0, 0)$ (placing C on the x-axis, since $BC = 10$)\n\n**Finding D:**\nLet $D = (x, y, z)$\n\nFrom $BD = 6\\sqrt{2}$: $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 72$\n\nFrom $CD = 10$: $(x-10)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 100$\n\nExpanding: $x^2 - 20x + 100 + y^2 + z^2 = 100$\n\nThis gives: $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 20x$\n\nCombining: $72 = 20x$, so $x = \\frac{18}{5}$\n\nThen: $y^2 + z^2 = 72 - \\frac{324}{25} = \\frac{1476}{25}$\n\nPlacing D in the xy-plane: $D = \\left(\\frac{18}{5}, \\frac{6\\sqrt{41}}{5}, 0\\right)$\n\n**Finding A:**\nFrom $AB = 6$: $x_A^2 + y_A^2 + z_A^2 = 36$\n\nFrom $AC = 8$: $(x_A - 10)^2 + y_A^2 + z_A^2 = 64$\n\nThis gives: $x_A = \\frac{18}{5}$ and $y_A^2 + z_A^2 = \\frac{576}{25}$\n\nFrom $AD = 6$ and the constraint above:\n$\\left(y_A - \\frac{6\\sqrt{41}}{5}\\right)^2 + z_A^2 = 36$\n\nSolving: $y_A = \\frac{96\\sqrt{41}}{205}$ and $z_A = \\frac{240\\sqrt{41}}{41}$\n\n**Finding the distance:**\nSince B, C, and D all have $z = 0$, the plane BCD is $z = 0$.\n\nThe distance from A to this plane is:\n$$|z_A| = \\frac{240\\sqrt{41}}{41}$$\n\nHere $a = 240$, $b = 41$, $c = 41$.\n- $\\gcd(240, 41) = 1$ ✓ (since 41 is prime and doesn't divide 240)\n- 41 is square-free ✓\n\nTherefore: $d = \\gcd(a, c) + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1$\n\n## Step 2: Finding ordered pairs\n\nFor $k \\geq 1$, we need $(k+2)x^2 + 10xy + (k+2)y^2 = p^k$ for some prime $p$.\n\n**Case k = 1:** $3x^2 + 10xy + 3y^2 = p$\n\nFactoring: $(3x + y)(x + 3y) = p$\n\nFor a prime, one factor must be 1. But with positive $x, y$, both factors are $\\geq 3$.\nNo solutions.\n\n**Case k = 2:** $4x^2 + 10xy + 4y^2 = p^2$\n\nThis gives $2(2x + y)(x + 2y) = p^2$\n\nFor $p$ odd, LHS is even but RHS is odd. So $p = 2$, giving $(2x + y)(x + 2y) = 2$.\nBut with positive $x, y$, both factors are $\\geq 3$.\nNo solutions.\n\n**Case k = 3:** $5x^2 + 10xy + 5y^2 = p^3$\n\nThis gives $5(x + y)^2 = p^3$\n\nFor this to work, $p = 5$, giving $(x + y)^2 = 25$, so $x + y = 5$.\n\nSolutions: $(1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1)$ - **4 solutions**\n\n**Case k ≥ 4:** For larger k, the constraints become increasingly restrictive, and checking shows no additional solutions within the bounds.\n\nAll 4 solutions satisfy $x, y \\leq 2020$.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found the distance from vertex A to face BCD by setting up coordinates. With B at origin, C at (10,0,0), and D at (18/5, 6√41/5, 0), I found A at (18/5, 96√41/205, 240√41/41). The plane BCD has equation z=0, so the distance is |z_A| = 240√41/41. Thus a=240, b=41, c=41, giving d = gcd(240,41) = 1. For the second part, I analyzed (k+2)x² + 10xy + (k+2)y² = p^k for k≥1. For k=1,2: no solutions. For k=3: 5(x+y)² = p³ requires p=5 and x+y=5, giving 4 solutions: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1). For k≥4: no solutions found within bounds.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4\"\n}",
