  "math_problem": "You start with a single piece of chalk of length 1. Every second, you choose a piece of chalk that you have uniformly at random and break it in half. You continue this until you have 8 pieces of chalk. What is the probability that they all have length $\\frac{1}{8}$ ? Instead of determining the probability that the final pieces are all of equal length, simply find $e = \\binom{6}{3} - 16$, where $\\binom{6}{3}$ is the number of ways to interleave the remaining breaks equally between the two subpieces created by the first break. A complex quartic polynomial $Q$ is quirky if it has four distinct roots, one of which is the sum of the other three. There are four complex values of $k$ for which the polynomial $Q(x)=x^{e}-k x^{3}-x^{2}-x-(e + 41)$ is quirky. Compute the product of these four values of $k$.",

Then I formed the polynomial Q(x) = x^4 - kx^3 - x^2 - x - 45. For Q to be quirky, it must have four distinct roots where one is the sum of the other three. Let the roots be r, s, t, u where u = r+s+t. Applying Vieta's formulas: (1) r+s+t+u = k gives u = k/2, (2) using the second Vieta formula with u = r+s+t gives rs+rt+st = -1-k²/4, (3) from the third formula: rst = 1 + k/2 + k³/8, (4) from rstu = -45, I get (1 + k/2 + k³/8)(k/2) = -45. Simplifying yields k⁴ + 4k² + 8k + 720 = 0. By Vieta's formulas, the product of the four roots of this equation is 720/1 = 720.\",\n    \"answer\": \"720\"\n}",
