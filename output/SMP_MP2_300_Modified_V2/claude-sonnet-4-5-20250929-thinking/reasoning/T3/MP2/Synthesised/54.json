  "math_problem": "Let $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ be a strictly increasing function such that $f(1)=1$ and $f(2n)f(2n+1)=9f(n)^{2}+3f(n)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Compute $f(137)$. Instead of computing the value of the function at the specified argument, simply find $k = f(68) - 730$, where $f(68)$ is the intermediate value of the function obtained by applying the recursive relation to reach the target argument. How many ways can the $k$ vertices of a three-dimensional cube be colored red and blue such that no two points connected by an edge are both red? Rotations and reflections of a given coloring are considered distinct.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to first find $f(68)$, then calculate $k$, and finally count the colorings of a cube with $k$ vertices.\n\n## Part 1: Finding $f(68)$\n\nLet me start by computing some initial values of $f$ using the given recurrence relation.\n\n**For $n=1$:**\n$$f(2)f(3) = 9f(1)^2 + 3f(1) = 9(1) + 3 = 12$$\n\nSince $f$ is strictly increasing with $f(1) = 1$, we need $1 < f(2) < f(3)$ and $f(2) \\cdot f(3) = 12$.\n\nTesting $f(2) = 3, f(3) = 4$:\n\n**For $n=2$:**\n$$f(4)f(5) = 9(3)^2 + 3(3) = 81 + 9 = 90$$\n\nThis gives $f(4) = 9, f(5) = 10$ ✓\n\n**For $n=3$:**\n$$f(6)f(7) = 9(4)^2 + 3(4) = 144 + 12 = 156$$\n\nThis gives $f(6) = 12, f(7) = 13$ ✓\n\nI notice that $f(2n) = 3f(n)$ and $f(2n+1) = 3f(n) + 1$.\n\nLet me verify: $f(2n)f(2n+1) = 3f(n)(3f(n)+1) = 9f(n)^2 + 3f(n)$ ✓\n\n**Pattern Discovery:**\nThis means $f(n)$ can be computed by taking the binary representation of $n$ and interpreting it as a base-3 number!\n\nFor example: $5 = 101_2 \\rightarrow 101_3 = 1 \\cdot 9 + 0 \\cdot 3 + 1 = 10$ ✓\n\n**Computing $f(68)$:**\n$$68 = 64 + 4 = 2^6 + 2^2 = 1000100_2$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$f(68) = 1000100_3 = 1 \\cdot 3^6 + 0 \\cdot 3^5 + 0 \\cdot 3^4 + 0 \\cdot 3^3 + 1 \\cdot 3^2 + 0 + 0$$\n$$= 729 + 9 = 738$$\n\nSo $k = f(68) - 730 = 738 - 730 = 8$.\n\n## Part 2: Coloring an 8-vertex Cube\n\nNow I need to count colorings of a 3D cube (8 vertices, 12 edges) where no two adjacent vertices are both red. This is equivalent to counting independent sets in the cube graph.\n\nI'll represent vertices as 3-bit binary strings: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111.\nTwo vertices are adjacent if they differ in exactly one bit.\n\n**Counting by independent set size:**\n\n- **Size 0:** Empty set (all blue) = **1**\n\n- **Size 1:** Any single vertex = **8**\n\n- **Size 2:** Non-adjacent pairs\n  - Total pairs: ${8 \\choose 2} = 28$\n  - Adjacent pairs (edges): 12\n  - Non-adjacent pairs: $28 - 12 = \\mathbf{16}$\n\n- **Size 3:** Three mutually non-adjacent vertices\n  - Maximum independent sets partition into:\n    - Even parity: {000, 011, 101, 110}\n    - Odd parity: {001, 010, 100, 111}\n  - Any 3 vertices from the same partition form an independent set\n  - Size-3 subsets: ${4 \\choose 3} + {4 \\choose 3} = 4 + 4 = \\mathbf{8}$\n\n- **Size 4:** Maximum independent sets\n  - Only the two complete partitions: **2**\n\n**Total:** $1 + 8 + 16 + 8 + 2 = 35$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found f(68) by discovering that f(n) is obtained by interpreting the binary representation of n as a base-3 number. For 68 = 1000100₂, we get f(68) = 1000100₃ = 729 + 9 = 738. Thus k = 738 - 730 = 8. The problem then asks for the number of ways to color an 8-vertex cube with red and blue such that no two adjacent vertices are both red. This is equivalent to counting independent sets in the cube graph. Counting by size: size 0 (1 way), size 1 (8 ways), size 2 (16 ways), size 3 (8 ways), size 4 (2 ways), giving a total of 1 + 8 + 16 + 8 + 2 = 35.\",\n    \"answer\": \"35\"\n}",
