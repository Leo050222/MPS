  "math_problem": "For how many positive integers $a$ does the polynomial $x^{2}-a x+a$ have an integer root? Instead of counting the positive integers $a$ such that the given quadratic polynomial has an integer root, simply find $k = a + 7$, where $a$ is a positive integer such that $x^{2} - a x + a$ has an integer root. Marisa has two identical cubical dice labeled with the numbers \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\). However, the two dice are not fair, meaning that they can land on each face with different probability. Marisa rolls the two dice and calculates their sum. Given that the sum is 2 with probability 0.04, and 12 with probability 0.01, the maximum possible probability of the sum being $k$ is $p$. Compute $\\lfloor (k + 93) p \\rfloor$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve two connected parts:\n\n## Part 1: Finding k = a + 7\n\nFor the polynomial $x^2 - ax + a$ to have an integer root $r$:\n\n$$r^2 - ar + a = 0$$\n$$r^2 = a(r-1)$$\n\nIf $r = 1$: We get $1 - a + a = 1 = 0$, which is impossible.\n\nIf $r \\neq 1$: Then $a = \\frac{r^2}{r-1}$\n\nFor $a$ to be a positive integer, I need $(r-1) | r^2$.\n\nLet me rewrite: $r^2 = (r-1) \\cdot r + r = (r-1) \\cdot r + (r-1) + 1 = (r-1)(r+1) + 1$\n\nFor $(r-1) | r^2$, we need $(r-1) | 1$, which means $r - 1 \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\n\nThis gives $r \\in \\{0, 2\\}$.\n\n- If $r = 0$: $a = \\frac{0}{-1} = 0$, not positive.\n- If $r = 2$: $a = \\frac{4}{1} = 4 > 0$ ✓\n\nVerification: $x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2$ has root $x = 2$ ✓\n\nTherefore, $a = 4$ is the unique positive integer, and:\n$$k = a + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11$$\n\n## Part 2: Dice Problem with k = 11\n\nLet $p_i$ be the probability that a die shows $i$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.\n\nGiven information:\n- Sum = 2 occurs when both dice show 1: $p_1^2 = 0.04 \\Rightarrow p_1 = 0.2$\n- Sum = 12 occurs when both dice show 6: $p_6^2 = 0.01 \\Rightarrow p_6 = 0.1$\n\nFor sum = 11, we need one die showing 5 and the other showing 6:\n$$P(\\text{sum} = 11) = 2p_5p_6 = 2p_5(0.1) = 0.2p_5$$\n\nConstraint: $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 = 1$\n\nSubstituting known values:\n$$0.2 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + 0.1 = 1$$\n$$p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 0.7$$\n\nTo maximize $p_5$, we minimize $p_2 + p_3 + p_4$. Since probabilities are non-negative, the minimum is 0.\n\nTherefore: $p_5^{\\max} = 0.7$\n\nMaximum probability of sum being 11:\n$$p = 0.2 \\times 0.7 = 0.14$$\n\n## Final Calculation\n\n$$\\lfloor (k + 93)p \\rfloor = \\lfloor (11 + 93)(0.14) \\rfloor = \\lfloor 104 \\times 0.14 \\rfloor$$\n\n$$104 \\times 0.14 = 14.56$$\n\n$$\\lfloor 14.56 \\rfloor = 14$$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found that x^2 - ax + a has an integer root only when a = 4 (with root r = 2), giving k = a + 7 = 11. Then, for the dice problem with k = 11, I determined p_1 = 0.2 and p_6 = 0.1 from the given probabilities. The sum equals 11 when one die shows 5 and the other shows 6, so P(sum = 11) = 2p_5p_6 = 0.2p_5. Using the constraint that probabilities sum to 1, the maximum value of p_5 is 0.7, giving maximum probability p = 0.14. Finally, ⌊(11 + 93) × 0.14⌋ = ⌊14.56⌋ = 14.\",\n    \"answer\": \"14\"\n}",
