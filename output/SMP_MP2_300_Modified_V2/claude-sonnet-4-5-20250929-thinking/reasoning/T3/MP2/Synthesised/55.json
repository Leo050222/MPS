  "math_problem": "Find all real numbers $k$ such that $r^{4}+k r^{3}+r^{2}+4 k r+16=0$ is true for exactly one real number $r$. Instead of finding all real parameters $k$ such that the quartic equation has exactly one real solution $r$, simply find $\\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is the value of $k$ for which the unique real root is positive, derived from the factorization analysis of the polynomial. Daniel wrote all the positive integers from 1 to $n$ inclusive on a piece of paper. After careful observation, he realized that the sum of all the digits that he wrote was exactly $\\kappa + \\frac{40009}{4}$. Find $n$.",
