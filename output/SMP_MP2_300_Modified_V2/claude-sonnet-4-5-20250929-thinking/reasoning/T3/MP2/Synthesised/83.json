  "math_problem": "Let $\\omega_{1}$ be a circle of radius 5, and let $\\omega_{2}$ be a circle of radius 2 whose center lies on $\\omega_{1}$. Let the two circles intersect at $A$ and $B$, and let the tangents to $\\omega_{2}$ at $A$ and $B$ intersect at $P$. If the area of $\\triangle ABP$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $b$ is square-free and $a, c$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a+10b+c$. Instead of computing the encoded integer from the parameters in the simplified expression for the area of $\\triangle ABP$, simply find $m = c - 22$, where $c$ is the denominator in that fractional expression derived from the geometric configuration of the circles and tangents. How many ways can you color the squares of a $(m - 1) \\times 2008$ grid in $m$ colors such that no two squares of the same color share an edge?",

Solve the grid coloring problem\n\n## Step 1: Finding the Area of Triangle ABP\n\nLet me set up coordinates with $\\omega_1$ centered at origin $O_1 = (0,0)$ with radius 5, and $\\omega_2$ centered at $O_2 = (5,0)$ (on $\\omega_1$) with radius 2.\n\n**Finding intersection points A and B:**\n- $\\omega_1$: $x^2 + y^2 = 25$\n- $\\omega_2$: $(x-5)^2 + y^2 = 4$\n\nExpanding $\\omega_2$: $x^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 = 4$, so $x^2 + y^2 = 10x - 21$\n\nSetting equal to $\\omega_1$: $25 = 10x - 21$, giving $x = \\frac{23}{5}$\n\nThen $y^2 = 25 - \\left(\\frac{23}{5}\\right)^2 = 25 - \\frac{529}{25} = \\frac{96}{25}$\n\nSo $y = \\pm\\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{5}$\n\nThus: $A = \\left(\\frac{23}{5}, \\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{5}\\right)$ and $B = \\left(\\frac{23}{5}, -\\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{5}\\right)$\n\n**Finding tangent lines:**\n\nFor tangent at A: perpendicular to $\\vec{O_2A} = \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{5}\\right)$\n\nThe tangent line equation: $-\\frac{2}{5}(x - \\frac{23}{5}) + \\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{5}(y - \\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{5}) = 0$\n\nSimplifying: $x - 2\\sqrt{6}y + 5 = 0$\n\nSimilarly, tangent at B: $x + 2\\sqrt{6}y + 5 = 0$\n\n**Finding point P:**\n\nAdding the two tangent equations: $2x + 10 = 0$, so $x = -5$\n\nSubstituting back: $y = 0$\n\nTherefore $P = (-5, 0)$\n\n**Computing area:**\n\nSince A and B have the same x-coordinate:\n- Base $|AB| = \\frac{8\\sqrt{6}}{5}$\n- Height from P to line AB: $h = \\left|\\frac{23}{5} - (-5)\\right| = \\frac{48}{5}$\n\nArea $= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{8\\sqrt{6}}{5} \\cdot \\frac{48}{5} = \\frac{192\\sqrt{6}}{25}$\n\nHere $a = 192$, $b = 6$, $c = 25$ (with $\\gcd(192, 25) = 1$ ✓ and 6 is square-free ✓)\n\n## Step 2: Computing m\n\n$m = c - 22 = 25 - 22 = 3$\n\n## Step 3: Grid Coloring Problem\n\nI need to count proper colorings of a $(m-1) \\times 2008 = 2 \\times 2008$ grid with $m = 3$ colors.\n\nFor a $2 \\times n$ grid (ladder graph), I'll use the transfer matrix method:\n\n- First column: $k(k-1)$ ways to color (different colors for top and bottom)\n- For each subsequent column, given previous column has colors $(a,b)$ with $a \\neq b$:\n  - New column needs $(c,d)$ with $c \\neq a$, $d \\neq b$, $c \\neq d$\n  - Number of ways: $(k-1)^2 - (k-2) = k^2 - 3k + 3$\n\nFor $k = 3$: $9 - 9 + 3 = 3$\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for a $2 \\times n$ ladder:\n$$P_n(k) = k(k-1) \\cdot (k^2 - 3k + 3)^{n-1}$$\n\nFor $n = 2008$, $k = 3$:\n$$P_{2008}(3) = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3^{2007} = 6 \\cdot 3^{2007} = 2 \\cdot 3^{2008}$$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Starting with two circles where ω₁ has radius 5 centered at origin and ω₂ has radius 2 centered at (5,0).
