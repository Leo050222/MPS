  "math_problem": "How many ways, without taking order into consideration, can 2002 be expressed as the sum of 3 positive integers (for instance, $1000+1000+2$ and $1000+2+1000$ are considered to be the same way)? Instead of determining the total number of unordered triples of positive integers that sum to the given total, simply find $l$, the terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends. Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer with exactly $(l + 2012)$ positive factors. What is the sum of the (not necessarily distinct) prime factors of $n$?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to work through several steps.\n\n## Step 1: Find the terminal term $l$\n\nTo express 2002 as a sum of 3 positive integers without order, I'll consider ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ where $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a + b + c = 2002$.\n\nFor fixed $a$, I need $b + c = 2002 - a$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n\nSince $b \\leq c$ and $b + c = 2002 - a$, we have $2b \\leq 2002 - a$, so $b \\leq \\lfloor\\frac{2002 - a}{2}\\rfloor$.\n\nCombined with $b \\geq a$, the valid range for $b$ is: $a \\leq b \\leq \\lfloor\\frac{2002 - a}{2}\\rfloor$.\n\nFor this range to be non-empty: $a \\leq \\lfloor\\frac{2002 - a}{2}\\rfloor$, which gives $a \\leq 667$.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is even** (since 2002 is even, $2002 - a$ is also even)\n- $\\lfloor\\frac{2002 - a}{2}\\rfloor = \\frac{2002 - a}{2}$\n- Number of valid $b$ values: $\\frac{2002 - a}{2} - a + 1 = \\frac{2004 - 3a}{2}$\n\nFor $a = 2, 4, 6, \\ldots, 666$:\n- The counts are: $\\frac{2004-6}{2} = 999, \\frac{2004-12}{2} = 996, \\ldots, \\frac{2004-1998}{2} = 3$\n- This is an arithmetic sequence: $999, 996, 993, \\ldots, 3$ with common difference $-3$\n- Number of terms: $\\frac{666-2}{2} + 1 = 333$ terms\n- **Terminal term: 3**\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is odd** (so $2002 - a$ is odd)\n- $\\lfloor\\frac{2002 - a}{2}\\rfloor = \\frac{2001 - a}{2}$\n- Number of valid $b$ values: $\\frac{2001 - a}{2} - a + 1 = \\frac{2003 - 3a}{2}$\n\nFor $a = 1, 3, 5, \\ldots, 667$:\n- The counts are: $\\frac{2003-3}{2} = 1000, \\frac{2003-9}{2} = 997, \\ldots, \\frac{2003-2001}{2} = 1$\n- This is an arithmetic sequence: $1000, 997, 994, \\ldots, 1$ with common difference $-3$\n- Number of terms: $\\frac{667-1}{2} + 1 = 334$ terms\n- **Terminal term: 1**\n\nThe shorter arithmetic sequence is from Case 1 (even $a$) with 333 terms and terminal term $\\boxed{l = 3}$.\n\n## Step 2: Find $n$ with exactly $l + 2012 = 2015$ divisors\n\nI need the smallest positive integer $n$ with exactly $2015$ divisors.\n\nFirst, factor 2015: $2015 = 5 \\times 403 = 5 \\times 13 \\times 31$\n\nIf $n = p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot p_3^{a_3}$, then the number of divisors is $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)(a_3+1) = 2015$.\n\nTo minimize $n$, I should:\n1. Use the smallest primes: 2, 3, 5\n2. Assign the largest exponents to the smallest primes\n\nSince $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)(a_3+1) = 5 \\times 13 \\times 31$, and I want to maximize the exponents on smaller primes:\n- $a_1 + 1 = 31 \\Rightarrow a_1 = 30$ (for prime 2)\n- $a_2 + 1 = 13 \\Rightarrow a_2 = 12$ (for prime 3)\n- $a_3 + 1 = 5 \\Rightarrow a_3 = 4$ (for prime 5)\n\nTherefore, $n = 2^{30} \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 5^{4}$.\n\n## Step 3: Sum of prime factors with multiplicity\n\nThe sum of all prime factors (counting multiplicity) is:\n$$30 \\times 2 + 12 \\times 3 + 4 \\times 5 = 60 + 36 + 20 = 116$$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found l by analyzing the case split for expressing 2002 as a sum of 3 positive integers. For even values of a, the counts form an arithmetic sequence ending at 3 (333 terms), while for odd values of a, the sequence ends at 1 (334 terms). The shorter sequence has terminal term l = 3. Then l + 2012 = 2015, so I need the smallest n with exactly 2015 divisors. Since 2015 = 5 × 13 × 31, the optimal factorization is n = 2^30 · 3^12 · 5^4.
