At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form."

  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems, I'll solve them step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Alice's Rock Game\n\nLet me denote $Q(m) = P(5m)$ where $P(N)$ is the probability of maintaining multiples of 5 from $N$ rocks to 0.\n\nStarting with $N = 5m$ rocks, to stay on multiples of 5, we must remove $k$ rocks where $k$ is a multiple of 5. \n\nThe possible values of $k$ are $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 5m\\}$, and among these, exactly $m$ values are multiples of 5: $\\{5, 10, \\ldots, 5m\\}$.\n\nSo the probability of removing a multiple of 5 is $\\frac{m}{5m} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nGiven we remove $5j$ rocks (for $j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, m\\}$), each with conditional probability $\\frac{1}{m}$, we get:\n\n$$Q(m) = \\frac{1}{5m} \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{m-1} Q(\\ell)$$\n\nwith $Q(0) = 1$.\n\nFrom this recursion:\n$$5m \\cdot Q(m) = \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{m-1} Q(\\ell)$$\n$$5(m+1) Q(m+1) = \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{m} Q(\\ell) = 5m \\cdot Q(m) + Q(m)$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$Q(m+1) = \\frac{5m+1}{5(m+1)} Q(m)$$\n\nThis gives us:\n$$Q(m) = \\prod_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{5k-4}{5k} = \\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^{m} (5k-4)}{5^m \\cdot m!}$$\n\nFor $2015 = 5 \\times 403$, we need $Q(403)$.\n\nTo find the exponent of 31 in $Q(403)$:\n$$v_{31}(Q(403)) = v_{31}\\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{403} (5k-4)\\right) - v_{31}(403!)$$\n\nFor $v_{31}(403!)$:\n$$v_{31}(403!) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{403}{31} \\right\\rfloor = 13$$\n\nFor $v_{31}\\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{403} (5k-4)\\right)$, I need to count how many $k \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 403\\}$ satisfy $5k - 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{31}$.\n\nThis gives $5k \\equiv 4 \\pmod{31}$. Since $5^{-1} \\equiv 25 \\pmod{31}$:\n$$k \\equiv 25 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 100 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{31}$$\n\nSo $k \\in \\{7, 38, 69, \\ldots\\}$, giving us $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{403-7}{31} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 13$ values.\n\nSince $403 < 961 = 31^2$, no value contributes higher powers of 31.\n\nTherefore: $v_{31}(Q(403)) = 13 - 13 = 0$\n\nSo $b = 0$ and $m = b + 2 = 2$.\n\n## Problem 2: System of Equations\n\nGiven: $x + y + z = 3$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3$\n\nUsing the identity:\n$$x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2+y^2+z^2-xy-yz-zx)$$\n\nWith $x + y + z = 3$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3$:\n$$3 - 3xyz = 3(x^2+y^2+z^2-xy-yz-zx)$$\n\nLet $e_2 = xy + yz + zx$ and $e_3 = xyz$.\n\nSince $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 - 2e_2$:\n$$1 - e_3 = 9 - 2e_2 - e_2$$\n$$e_3 = 3e_2 - 8$$\n\nThe values $(x, y, z)$ are roots of:\n$$t^3 - 3t^2 + e_2t - (3e_2-8) = 0$$\n\nFor any value of $e_2 \\in \\mathbb{C}$, this gives a valid solution.\n\n**Special case:** When $e_2 = 3$:\n$$t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t - 1 = (t-1)^3 = 0$$\ngiving $(x,y,z) = (1,1,1)$.\n\n**General answer:** The solution set is parameterized by $s = xy + yz + zx$. For any $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$, the solution is any permutation of the three roots (counted with multiplicity) of:\n$$t^3 - 3t^2 + st - (3s-8) = 0$$\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, through recursion analysis and computing v_31 of numerator and denominator, b=0, so m=b+2=2.
