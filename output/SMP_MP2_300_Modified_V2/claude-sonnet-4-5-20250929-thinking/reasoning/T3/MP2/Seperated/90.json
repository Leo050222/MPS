  "reasoning_content": "## Problem 1 Solution\n\nLet the two quadratics be:\n- $f(x) = x^2 + (r-1)x + 6$\n- $g(x) = x^2 + (2r+1)x + 22$\n\nIf $\\alpha$ is their common real root, then:\n- $\\alpha^2 + (r-1)\\alpha + 6 = 0$\n- $\\alpha^2 + (2r+1)\\alpha + 22 = 0$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n$$[(2r+1) - (r-1)]\\alpha + (22 - 6) = 0$$\n$$(r+2)\\alpha + 16 = 0$$\n\nFor $r \\neq -2$, we get $\\alpha = -\\frac{16}{r+2}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n$$\\left(-\\frac{16}{r+2}\\right)^2 + (r-1)\\left(-\\frac{16}{r+2}\\right) + 6 = 0$$\n\nMultiplying by $(r+2)^2$:\n$$256 - 16(r-1)(r+2) + 6(r+2)^2 = 0$$\n\nExpanding:\n$$256 - 16(r^2 + r - 2) + 6(r^2 + 4r + 4) = 0$$\n$$256 - 16r^2 - 16r + 32 + 6r^2 + 24r + 24 = 0$$\n$$-10r^2 + 8r + 312 = 0$$\n$$5r^2 - 4r - 156 = 0$$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$$r = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 3120}}{10} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{3136}}{10} = \\frac{4 \\pm 56}{10}$$\n\nSo $r = 6$ or $r = -\\frac{26}{5}$.\n\nVerification:\n- For $r = 6$: $f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x+2)(x+3)$ and $g(x) = x^2 + 13x + 22 = (x+2)(x+11)$ share root $x = -2$. ✓\n- For $r = -\\frac{26}{5}$: $\\alpha = -\\frac{16}{-\\frac{26}{5}+2} = -\\frac{16}{-\\frac{16}{5}} = 5$, which can be verified to satisfy both equations. ✓\n\nThe sum of possible values of $r$ is:\n$$6 + \\left(-\\frac{26}{5}\\right) = \\frac{30 - 26}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\n\nSo $a = 4$ and $b = 5$ (relatively prime).\n\nTherefore, $m = b - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1$.\n\n## Problem 2 Solution\n\nWe need to find $v_2(3^{512} - 1)$, where $v_2(n)$ denotes the largest power of 2 dividing $n$.\n\nUsing the Lifting the Exponent (LTE) lemma for $p = 2$: when $a$ and $b$ are both odd and $n$ is even,\n$$v_2(a^n - b^n) = v_2(a-b) + v_2(a+b) + v_2(n) - 1$$\n\nWith $a = 3$, $b = 1$, and $n = 512 = 2^9$:\n- $v_2(3-1) = v_2(2) = 1$\n- $v_2(3+1) = v_2(4) = 2$\n- $v_2(512) = v_2(2^9) = 9$\n\nTherefore:\n$$v_2(3^{512} - 1) = 1 + 2 + 9 - 1 = 11$$\n\nThe largest $n$ such that $2^n | (3^{512} - 1)$ is $n = 11$.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I found the common root condition leads to the equation 5r² - 4r - 156 = 0, giving r = 6 and r = -26/5. Their sum is 4/5, so b = 5 and m = b - 4 = 1. For Problem 2, using the Lifting the Exponent lemma for p = 2 with a = 3, b = 1, n = 512 = 2⁹, I calculated v₂(3⁵¹² - 1) = v₂(3-1) + v₂(3+1) + v₂(512) - 1 = 1 + 2 + 9 - 1 = 11.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
