The concavity condition is naturally satisfied for most such configurations since the four points are not all in convex position (with two fixed on the bottom and two above).\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I tracked the probability of reaching state (5,1) - having 5 heads with the last preceded by a tail - without seeing three consecutive heads.
