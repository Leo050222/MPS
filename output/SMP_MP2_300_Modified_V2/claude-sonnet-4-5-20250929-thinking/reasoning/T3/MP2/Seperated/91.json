  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these problems, I'll solve them systematically.\n\n## Problem 1: Distance from vertex A to face BCD\n\nGiven tetrahedron ABCD with:\n- AB = 6, BD = 6√2, BC = 10, AC = 8, CD = 10, AD = 6\n\n**Setting up coordinates:**\n\nLet me place B at the origin and C on the x-axis:\n- B = (0, 0, 0)\n- C = (10, 0, 0)\n\n**Finding D:**\nFrom BD = 6√2: x² + y² + z² = 72\nFrom CD = 10: (x-10)² + y² + z² = 100\n\nExpanding the second equation:\nx² + y² + z² - 20x + 100 = 100\n\nSubstituting the first: 72 - 20x = 0, so x = 18/5\n\nThen y² + z² = 72 - 324/25 = 1476/25\n\nPlacing D in the xy-plane: z = 0, y = 6√41/5\nSo D = (18/5, 6√41/5, 0)\n\n**Finding A:**\nFrom AB = 6: x² + y² + z² = 36\nFrom AC = 8: (x-10)² + y² + z² = 64\n\nFrom these two: 36 - 20x + 100 = 64, so x = 18/5\n\nThen y² + z² = 36 - 324/25 = 576/25\n\nFrom AD = 6: (18/5 - 18/5)² + (y - 6√41/5)² + z² = 36\n\nThis gives: (y - 6√41/5)² + z² = 36\n\nExpanding: y² + z² - (12√41/5)y + 1476/25 = 36\n\nSubstituting y² + z² = 576/25:\n576/25 - (12√41/5)y + 1476/25 = 900/25\n(12√41/5)y = 1152/25\ny = 96/(5√41) = 96√41/205\n\nThen z² = 576/25 - 9216/1025 = (23616 - 9216)/1025 = 14400/1025 = 576/41\n\nSo z = 24√41/41 (taking positive value)\n\n**Finding the distance:**\nSince B, C, and D all have z = 0, the plane BCD is the xy-plane (z = 0).\n\nThe distance from A to this plane is simply the z-coordinate of A:\n**Distance = 24√41/41**\n\nHere a = 24, b = 41, c = 41.\nSince 41 is prime and doesn't divide 24 = 2³ · 3, we have gcd(24, 41) = 1.\n\nTherefore, d = gcd(a, c) + 0 = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\n## Problem 2: Prime powers of 3x² + 10xy + 3y²\n\n**Factoring:**\n3x² + 10xy + 3y² = (3x + y)(x + 3y)\n\nFor this to equal p^k, we need:\n- 3x + y = p^a\n- x + 3y = p^b\n\nwhere a + b = k.\n\n**Solving for x and y:**\nFrom these equations:\n- x = (3p^a - p^b)/8\n- y = (3p^b - p^a)/8\n\nFor positive integers, we need:\n- 3p^a - p^b ≡ 0 (mod 8) and 3p^a > p^b\n- 3p^b - p^a ≡ 0 (mod 8) and 3p^b > p^a\n\nThe positivity conditions give p^|a-b| < 3.\n\n**Case p = 2:**\nTesting systematically:\n\n1. **a = b = k** (k ≥ 2): x = y = 2^(k-2)\n   Need 2^(k-2) ≤ 2020, so k ≤ 12\n   This gives k = 2, 3, ..., 12: **11 solutions**\n\n2. **b = a + 1** (a ≥ 3): x = 2^(a-3), y = 5·2^(a-3)\n   Need 5·2^(a-3) ≤ 2020, so 2^(a-3) ≤ 404, giving a ≤ 11\n   This gives a = 3, 4, ..., 11: **9 solutions**\n\n3. **a = b + 1** (b ≥ 3): x = 5·2^(b-3), y = 2^(b-3)\n   Need 5·2^(b-3) ≤ 2020, so b ≤ 11\n   This gives b = 3, 4, ..., 11: **9 solutions**\n\n**Case p odd:**\nFor odd primes, the divisibility conditions by 8 and the positivity constraints cannot be simultaneously satisfied. The key issue is that for a = b (the only case where both x and y can be positive), we get x = y = p^a/4, which is not an integer for odd p.\n\n**Total:** 11 + 9 + 9 = **29 solutions**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I placed the tetrahedron in a coordinate system and found that face BCD lies in the xy-plane, making the distance calculation straightforward.
