  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems, I'll solve them step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Penta Game Probability\n\nWe have 5 players, each choosing 2 roles from 5 available roles. We need to find the total number of favorable outcomes where each role is chosen by exactly 2 players.\n\n**Setup verification:**\n- Total choices made: 5 players × 2 roles = 10 choices\n- For each role to have exactly 2 players: 5 roles × 2 players = 10 choices ✓\n\n**Counting favorable outcomes:**\n\nThis problem is equivalent to counting 5×5 binary matrices where:\n- Each row sum equals 2 (each player chooses 2 roles)\n- Each column sum equals 2 (each role is chosen by 2 players)\n\nThis is the same as counting 2-regular bipartite graphs on K₅,₅.\n\nFor an n×n binary matrix with all row sums and column sums equal to r, this is a well-studied problem. For n=5 and r=2, the count is:\n\n**T(favorable) = 2040**\n\nTherefore:\n**e = T(favorable) - 1940 = 2040 - 1940 = 100**\n\n## Problem 2: Finding n with average ||k|| = 100\n\nFirst, let me understand the pattern of ||k||:\n\nFor integers between m² and (m+1)²:\n- When k = m² + j where 0 ≤ j ≤ m: ||k|| = j (closer to m²)\n- When k = m² + j where m < j < 2m+1: ||k|| = 2m+1-j (closer to (m+1)²)\n\n**Sum pattern for each segment:**\n\nFor k from m² to (m+1)² - 1, the sum is:\n$$\\sum_{j=0}^{m} j + \\sum_{j=1}^{m} j = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2} + \\frac{m(m+1)}{2} = m(m+1)$$\n\nFor n = M², the cumulative sum is:\n$$S(M²) = \\sum_{m=1}^{M-1} m(m+1) = \\frac{(M-1)M(M+1)}{3}$$\n\n**Finding n where S(n)/n = 100:**\n\nFor n ≈ M², we have:\n$$\\frac{S(M²)}{M²} = \\frac{(M-1)(M+1)}{3M} \\approx \\frac{M}{3}$$\n\nFor this to equal 100, we need M ≈ 300.\n\n**Precise calculation for M = 300:**\n\n$$S(90000) = \\frac{299 \\cdot 300 \\cdot 301}{3} = 8,999,900$$\n\nWe need S(n) = 100n. For n = 90000:\n- S(90000) = 8,999,900\n- 100n = 9,000,000\n\nSo we need to add more terms. For n = 90000 + k where k ≤ 300:\n\nThe partial sum for the next k terms is: k(k+1)/2\n\nSetting up the equation:\n$$8,999,900 + \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 100(90000 + k)$$\n$$\\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 100 + 100k$$\n$$k² + k = 200 + 200k$$\n$$k² - 199k - 200 = 0$$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$$k = \\frac{199 \\pm \\sqrt{39601 + 800}}{2} = \\frac{199 \\pm 201}{2}$$\n\nSo k = 200 (taking the positive root).\n\n**Verification:**\nn = 90000 + 200 = 90200\nS(90200) = 8,999,900 + 200(201)/2 = 8,999,900 + 20,100 = 9,020,000\nS(90200)/90200 = 9,020,000/90,200 = 100 ✓\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Counting 5×5 binary matrices with row and column sums equal to 2 gives T(favorable) = 2040, so e = 2040 - 1940 = 100.
