Averaging over all possible functions and cycle structures, the probability works out to $\\frac{1}{n}$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nWe need to count monotone Boolean functions $f:\\{0,1\\}^3 \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$, where $a_i \\geq b_i$ for all $i$ implies $f(a_1, a_2, a_3) \\geq f(b_1, b_2, b_3)$.\n\n**Analysis:**\nA monotone Boolean function corresponds to an \"upset\" (or \"filter\") in the poset $\\{0,1\\}^3$. Each upset is uniquely determined by its set of minimal elements, which form an antichain. So we need to count antichains in $\\{0,1\\}^3$.\n\nLet me organize by levels:\n- Level 0: $(0,0,0)$\n- Level 1: $(0,0,1), (0,1,0), (1,0,0)$ — call these $a, b, c$\n- Level 2: $(0,1,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,0)$ — call these $A, B, C$  \n- Level 3: $(1,1,1)$\n\n**Comparability between levels 1 and 2:**\n- $a = (0,0,1) < A = (0,1,1)$ and $a < B = (1,0,1)$, but $a$ and $C$ are incomparable\n- $b = (0,1,0) < A$ and $b < C = (1,1,0)$, but $b$ and $B$ are incomparable\n- $c = (1,0,0) < B$ and $c < C$, but $c$ and $A$ are incomparable\n\n**Counting antichains:**\n1. Empty antichain: 1\n2. $\\{(0,0,0)\\}$: 1\n3. Level 1 only (non-empty subsets): $\\{a\\}, \\{b\\}, \\{c\\}, \\{a,b\\}, \\{a,c\\}, \\{b,c\\}, \\{a,b,c\\}$: 7\n4. Level 2 only (non-empty subsets): $\\{A\\}, \\{B\\}, \\{C\\}, \\{A,B\\}, \\{A,C\\}, \\{B,C\\}, \\{A,B,C\\}$: 7\n5. $\\{(1,1,1)\\}$: 1\n6. Mixed level 1 and 2 (elements from both levels that are pairwise incomparable):\n   - $\\{a, C\\}$: valid (incomparable)\n   - $\\{b, B\\}$: valid (incomparable)\n   - $\\{c, A\\}$: valid (incomparable)\n   - Total: 3\n\n**Total:** $1 + 1 + 7 + 7 + 1 + 3 = 20$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, the condition requires that elements 1 and a are on the same cycle in the functional graph. By symmetry in random functions, this probability is 1/n. For Problem 2, we count antichains in the Boolean cube {0,1}^3, which correspond to monotone Boolean functions. By systematically counting antichains at each level and mixed levels, we get 20 total.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/n\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"20\"\n}",
