  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems:\n\n## Problem 1: Integer roots of $x^2 - ax + a$\n\nIf $r$ is an integer root of $x^2 - ax + a = 0$, then:\n$$r^2 - ar + a = 0$$\n$$r^2 = a(r - 1)$$\n\nFor $r \\neq 1$, we can solve for $a$:\n$$a = \\frac{r^2}{r - 1}$$\n\nLet me rewrite this:\n$$a = \\frac{r^2}{r - 1} = \\frac{r^2 - 1 + 1}{r - 1} = \\frac{(r-1)(r+1) + 1}{r - 1} = r + 1 + \\frac{1}{r - 1}$$\n\nFor $a$ to be an integer, we need $(r - 1) | 1$, so $r - 1 \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$, giving $r \\in \\{0, 2\\}$.\n\n- If $r = 0$: $a = \\frac{0}{-1} = 0$ (not positive)\n- If $r = 2$: $a = \\frac{4}{1} = 4$ (positive!)\n\nLet me verify: $x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2$, so $x = 2$ is indeed a root.\n\nFor $a$ to be positive, we need $\\frac{r^2}{r-1} > 0$. This requires $r > 1$, so only $r = 2$ gives a positive $a$.\n\nTherefore, $a = 4$ is the only positive integer for which the polynomial has an integer root.\n\nThus, $k = a + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11$.\n\n## Problem 2: Maximum probability of sum being 7\n\nLet $p_i$ be the probability of rolling $i$ on a single die.\n\nGiven information:\n- $P(\\text{sum} = 2) = p_1^2 = 0.04 \\Rightarrow p_1 = 0.2$\n- $P(\\text{sum} = 12) = p_6^2 = 0.01 \\Rightarrow p_6 = 0.1$\n- $\\sum_{i=1}^{6} p_i = 1$\n\nThe probability of sum being 7:\n$$P(\\text{sum} = 7) = 2(p_1p_6 + p_2p_5 + p_3p_4)$$\n\nThe factor of 2 accounts for both orderings of the dice.\n\nSubstituting known values:\n$$P(\\text{sum} = 7) = 2(0.2 \\cdot 0.1 + p_2p_5 + p_3p_4) = 0.04 + 2(p_2p_5 + p_3p_4)$$\n\nWe need to maximize $p_2p_5 + p_3p_4$ subject to:\n$$p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 1 - 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.7$$\n\nTo maximize $p_2p_5 + p_3p_4$, I'll check boundary cases.\n\n**Case 1:** Set $p_3 = p_4 = 0$. Then $p_2 + p_5 = 0.7$.\nBy AM-GM, $p_2p_5$ is maximized when $p_2 = p_5 = 0.35$.\nThis gives $p_2p_5 + p_3p_4 = 0.35^2 + 0 = 0.1225$.\n\n**Case 2:** Set $p_2 = p_5 = 0$. Then $p_3 + p_4 = 0.7$.\nBy AM-GM, $p_3p_4$ is maximized when $p_3 = p_4 = 0.35$.\nThis gives $p_2p_5 + p_3p_4 = 0 + 0.35^2 = 0.1225$.\n\nThe interior critical point (using Lagrange multipliers) gives $p_2 = p_3 = p_4 = p_5 = 0.175$, yielding $2(0.175)^2 = 0.06125 < 0.1225$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum is:\n$$P(\\text{sum} = 7) = 0.04 + 2(0.1225) = 0.04 + 0.245 = 0.285$$\n\nThus, $p = 0.285$ and $\\lfloor 100p \\rfloor = \\lfloor 28.5 \\rfloor = 28$.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Finding integer roots of x^2 - ax + a, we get a = r^2/(r-1) which must be a positive integer. This forces r-1 to divide 1, giving only r=2 and a=4. Thus k = a+7 = 11. For Problem 2: With p_1=0.2 and p_6=0.1, we maximize P(sum=7) = 0.04 + 2(p_2*p_5 + p_3*p_4) subject to p_2+p_3+p_4+p_5=0.7. The maximum occurs at boundary cases where either {p_2=p_5=0.35, p_3=p_4=0} or {p_2=p_5=0, p_3=p_4=0.35}, giving p=0.285 and floor(100p)=28.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"28\"\n}\n```",
