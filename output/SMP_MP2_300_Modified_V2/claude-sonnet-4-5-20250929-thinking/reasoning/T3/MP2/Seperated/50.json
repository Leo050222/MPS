In order to feel safe, every duck must either be standing next to at least one cow or between two rabbits. If there are 600 ducks, what is the least number of cows there can be for this to be possible? Instead of determining the minimal number of cows required, simply find $k = r - 198$, where $r$ is the number of rabbits in the arrangement that achieves this minimum."

  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems:\n\n## Problem 1: Farmer Bill's Animals\n\n**Given:**\n- 1000 total animals in a circle\n- 600 ducks, c cows, r rabbits\n- c + r = 400\n- Every duck must be either:\n  - Next to at least one cow, OR\n  - Between two rabbits\n\n**Strategy to minimize cows:**\n\nTo minimize c, I should maximize the number of ducks protected by rabbits.\n\nIn a circular arrangement with alternating R-D-R-D pattern, if we have r rabbits arranged optimally, we can protect exactly r ducks (each duck between two rabbits).\n\nThe remaining (600 - r) ducks must be adjacent to cows.\n\nIn the optimal case, each cow can protect up to 2 adjacent ducks. With c cows, we can protect at most 2c ducks.\n\nTherefore: 2c ≥ 600 - r\n\n**Finding the minimum:**\n\nGiven c + r = 400, we have c = 400 - r\n\nSubstituting: 400 - r ≥ (600 - r)/2\n\nMultiply by 2: 800 - 2r ≥ 600 - r\n\nSimplify: 800 - 600 ≥ 2r - r\n\nResult: 200 ≥ r\n\nSo r ≤ 200, which means c ≥ 200.\n\nThe minimum number of cows is c = 200, achieved when r = 200.\n\n**Verification:** \n- 200 rabbits in R-D alternating pattern protect 200 ducks\n- 200 cows arranged in D-C-D or C-D-D-C patterns protect remaining 400 ducks\n- Each cow is adjacent to exactly 2 ducks on average\n\nTherefore: k = r - 198 = 200 - 198 = **2**\n\n## Problem 2: Maximum Points with Unit Distance Property\n\nWe need the largest n where we can place n points such that every triple contains at least one unit distance pair.\n\n**Equivalent formulation:** The graph of non-unit distances must be triangle-free.\n\n**Analysis by size:**\n- **n = 7:** We can use vertices and center of a regular hexagon with unit side length\n  - The 6 vertices form a cycle of unit distances\n  - The center is unit distance from all vertices  \n  - Total: 12 unit distance pairs out of C(7,2) = 21 pairs\n  - The 9 non-unit pairs (long diagonals) form a triangle-free graph ✓\n\n- **n = 8:** It can be proven this is impossible\n  - By Turán's theorem, a triangle-free graph on 8 vertices has at most 16 edges\n  - We'd need at least C(8,2) - 16 = 28 - 16 = 12 unit distance pairs\n  - But geometric constraints in the plane prevent embedding 8 points with this structure\n\nThe maximum is **n = 7**.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To minimize cows, we maximize rabbits protecting ducks. With r rabbits in alternating R-D pattern, we protect r ducks. Remaining (600-r) ducks need cows. With each cow protecting 2 ducks: 2c ≥ 600-r. Since c+r=400, we get c=400-r ≥ (600-r)/2, giving r ≤ 200. Minimum c=200 when r=200, so k=200-198=2. Problem 2: We need every triple to contain a unit distance pair, equivalent to non-unit distances forming a triangle-free graph. The configuration of a regular hexagon with center (7 points) achieves this with 12 unit distances. For n=8, Turán's theorem and geometric constraints make it impossible.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}\n```",
