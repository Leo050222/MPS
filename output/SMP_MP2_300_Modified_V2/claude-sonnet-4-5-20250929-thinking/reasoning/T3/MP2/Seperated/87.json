  "reasoning_content": "## Problem 1: Finding k on a chessboard\n\nOn a standard chessboard, adjacent squares have opposite colors. In a $5 \\times 5$ square, there are 25 cells (odd number), so we cannot have equal numbers of black and white squares.\n\nThe key insight is that the color distribution depends on the starting position:\n- If the top-left corner is at position $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is even, the square has 13 white and 12 black cells\n- If $i+j$ is odd, the square has 13 black and 12 white cells\n\nFor a $k \\times k$ board, the number of possible positions for a $5 \\times 5$ square is $(k-4)^2$, where the top-left corner can be at positions $(i,j)$ with $1 \\leq i,j \\leq k-4$.\n\nLet $n = k-4$. I need to count positions where $i+j$ is odd.\n\nFor $n$ positions along each dimension:\n- If $n = 2m+1$ (odd), there are $m+1$ odd positions and $m$ even positions\n- Positions with $i+j$ odd: $(m+1) \\cdot m + m \\cdot (m+1) = 2m(m+1)$\n- Total positions: $(2m+1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1$\n- Probability: $\\frac{2m(m+1)}{4m^2 + 4m + 1} = 0.48$\n\nSolving:\n$$2m(m+1) = 0.48(4m^2 + 4m + 1)$$\n$$2m^2 + 2m = 1.92m^2 + 1.92m + 0.48$$\n$$0.08m^2 + 0.08m = 0.48$$\n$$m^2 + m = 6$$\n$$m^2 + m - 6 = 0$$\n$$(m+3)(m-2) = 0$$\n\nSo $m = 2$, giving $n = 2(2)+1 = 5$.\n\nVerification: With $n=5$, we have $25$ positions total, with $2(2)(3) = 12$ having $i+j$ odd, giving probability $12/25 = 0.48$ ✓\n\nTherefore: $b = n - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2$\n\n## Problem 2: Finding integer pairs (x,y)\n\nStarting with $3^x \\cdot 4^y = 2^{x+y} + 2^{2(x+y)-1}$\n\nSince $4^y = 2^{2y}$:\n$$3^x \\cdot 2^{2y} = 2^{x+y}(1 + 2^{x+y-1})$$\n\nDividing by $2^{x+y}$:\n$$3^x \\cdot 2^{y-x} = 1 + 2^{x+y-1}$$\n\n**Testing small values systematically:**\n\nFor $x = 0, y = 1$:\n- LHS: $3^0 \\cdot 4^1 = 4$\n- RHS: $2^1 + 2^{2(1)-1} = 2 + 2 = 4$ ✓\n\nFor $x = 1, y = 1$:\n- LHS: $3^1 \\cdot 4^1 = 12$\n- RHS: $2^2 + 2^{2(2)-1} = 4 + 8 = 12$ ✓\n\nFor $x = 2, y = 2$:\n- LHS: $3^2 \\cdot 4^2 = 144$\n- RHS: $2^4 + 2^{2(4)-1} = 16 + 128 = 144$ ✓\n\nFor $x = 3, y = 3$:\n- LHS: $3^3 \\cdot 4^3 = 1728$\n- RHS: $2^6 + 2^{2(6)-1} = 64 + 2048 = 2112$ ✗\n\nFor $x \\geq 3$, we can show that $3^x < 2^{2x-1}$ (since $3^3 = 27 < 32 = 2^5$), which means the equation cannot hold for equal $x$ and $y$.\n\nTesting unequal values and negative values yields no additional integer solutions.\n\n**The solutions are:** $(x,y) \\in \\{(0,1), (1,1), (2,2)\\}$\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: In a chessboard, a 5×5 square has more black than white squares when its top-left corner is at a position (i,j) where i+j is odd. Setting n = k-4 as the number of possible positions along one dimension, and with probability 0.48 for more black squares, we solve to get n = 5, giving b = n - 3 = 2.
