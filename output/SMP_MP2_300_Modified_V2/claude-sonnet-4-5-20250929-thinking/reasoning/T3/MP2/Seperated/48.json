      "A1054": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $e = N - 86$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen."

  "reasoning_content": "## Problem 1 Solution\n\nLet me analyze this problem step by step.\n\nGiven:\n- 8 different blood antigens exist\n- 256 students in the lecture hall\n- Each student has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the 8 antigens\n- Since 2^8 = 256, every possible subset of the 8 antigens is represented by exactly one student\n\nThe problem asks us to find e = N - 86, where N is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen.\n\nTo find N:\n- Consider any specific antigen (let's call it antigen A)\n- A student's blood type includes antigen A if their subset contains A\n- The number of subsets of 8 antigens that include a specific antigen A equals the number of ways to choose the remaining antigens\n- This is 2^7 = 128 (we can either include or exclude each of the other 7 antigens)\n\nTherefore:\n- N = 128\n- e = N - 86 = 128 - 86 = 42\n\n## Problem 2 Solution\n\nLet James's three integers be a, b, and c.\n\nAlex can perform three operations:\n1. Average of a and b, plus c: (a+b)/2 + c\n2. Average of a and c, plus b: (a+c)/2 + b  \n3. Average of b and c, plus a: (b+c)/2 + a\n\nLet's call these results x, y, and z respectively. We know {x, y, z} = {42, 13, 37}.\n\nAdding all three equations:\nx + y + z = (a+b)/2 + c + (a+c)/2 + b + (b+c)/2 + a\n= (2a + 2b + 2c)/2 + (a + b + c)\n= (a + b + c) + (a + b + c)\n= 2(a + b + c)\n\nTherefore: a + b + c = (42 + 13 + 37)/2 = 92/2 = 46\n\nNow I can express each result in terms of the individual variables:\n- x = (a+b)/2 + c = (a+b+c+c)/2 = (46+c)/2 = 23 + c/2\n- y = (a+c)/2 + b = (a+b+c+b)/2 = (46+b)/2 = 23 + b/2\n- z = (b+c)/2 + a = (a+b+c+a)/2 = (46+a)/2 = 23 + a/2\n\nFrom these equations:\n- c = 2(x - 23) = 2x - 46\n- b = 2(y - 23) = 2y - 46\n- a = 2(z - 23) = 2z - 46\n\nTrying the assignment x = 42, y = 13, z = 37:\n- c = 2(42) - 46 = 38\n- b = 2(13) - 46 = -20\n- a = 2(37) - 46 = 28\n\nVerification:\n- (a+b)/2 + c = (28-20)/2 + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42 ✓\n- (a+c)/2 + b = (28+38)/2 - 20 = 33 - 20 = 13 ✓\n- (b+c)/2 + a = (-20+38)/2 + 28 = 9 + 28 = 37 ✓\n\nThe three integers are -20, 28, and 38.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Since there are 256 = 2^8 students representing all possible subsets of 8 antigens, a given antigen appears in exactly 2^7 = 128 students' blood types. Therefore N = 128 and e = N - 86 = 42. For Problem 2: Setting up equations for the three possible operations and using the sum constraint, we find a + b + c = 46. Solving the system gives us the three integers: -20, 28, and 38.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"42\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"-20, 28, 38\"\n        }",
