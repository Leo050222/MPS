  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems, I'll solve them step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Finding integer pairs $(m,n)$ satisfying $m^5 - n^5 = 16mn$\n\nFirst, let me check the trivial solution:\n- If $m = 0$ or $n = 0$, we get $(0,0)$ as a solution.\n\nFor a solution with opposite signs, let's assume $m < 0$ and $n > 0$ (since if $m > 0$ and $n < 0$, the left side is positive while the right side is negative).\n\nLet $m = -a$ where $a > 0$:\n$$(-a)^5 - n^5 = 16(-a)n$$\n$$-a^5 - n^5 = -16an$$\n$$a^5 + n^5 = 16an$$\n\nLet me try small positive integer values:\n- $(a,n) = (1,1)$: $1 + 1 = 2 \\neq 16$\n- $(a,n) = (2,2)$: $32 + 32 = 64 = 16(2)(2)$ ✓\n\nSo $(a,n) = (2,2)$ works, giving us $(m,n) = (-2,2)$.\n\nLet me verify: $(-2)^5 - 2^5 = -32 - 32 = -64$ and $16(-2)(2) = -64$ ✓\n\nChecking a few more values confirms this is the only small solution:\n- $(a,n) = (3,3)$: $243 + 243 = 486 \\neq 144$\n\nFor large values, $a^5 + n^5$ grows much faster than $16an$, so there are only finitely many solutions.\n\nSince the problem asks for \"the solution pair with variables of opposite signs\" (singular), $(m,n) = (-2,2)$ is the unique such pair.\n\nHere $n = 2$ is positive, so $k = n - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n\n## Problem 2: Minimizing $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{2}{q} + \\frac{3}{r}$\n\nBy Vieta's formulas, since $p, q, r$ are roots of $x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48$:\n- $pqr = 48$\n\nWe want to minimize $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{2}{q} + \\frac{3}{r} = \\frac{qr + 2pr + 3pq}{48}$.\n\nSo we minimize $f(p,q,r) = qr + 2pr + 3pq$ subject to $pqr = 48$.\n\nUsing Lagrange multipliers with constraint $g(p,q,r) = pqr - 48 = 0$:\n\n$$\\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g$$\n\nThis gives us:\n- $2r + 3q = \\lambda qr$ ... (1)\n- $r + 3p = \\lambda pr$ ... (2)  \n- $q + 2p = \\lambda pq$ ... (3)\n\nMultiplying (1) by $p$, (2) by $q$, and (3) by $r$:\n- $2pr + 3pq = 48\\lambda$\n- $qr + 3pq = 48\\lambda$\n- $qr + 2pr = 48\\lambda$\n\nFrom the first two equations: $2pr = qr$, so $q = 2p$\n\nFrom the second and third: $3pq = 2pr$, so $3q = 2r$\n\nSubstituting $q = 2p$ into $3q = 2r$:\n$$r = \\frac{3q}{2} = \\frac{3(2p)}{2} = 3p$$\n\nUsing $pqr = 48$:\n$$p(2p)(3p) = 48$$\n$$6p^3 = 48$$\n$$p = 2$$\n\nTherefore: $p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$\n\nWe verify: $p < q < r$ (✓) and $pqr = 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 = 48$ (✓)\n\nThe minimum value is:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I found that (m,n) = (-2,2) is the unique solution with opposite signs by substituting m = -a and solving a^5 + n^5 = 16an.
