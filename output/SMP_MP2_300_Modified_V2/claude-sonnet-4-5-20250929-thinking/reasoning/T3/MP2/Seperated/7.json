(2)\n\n**Step 2:** Now I have a system:\n- Equation (1): $3f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + \\frac{2f(x)}{x} = x^{2}$\n- Equation (2): $3f(x) + 2xf\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$\n\n**Step 3:** From equation (1), solve for $f(1/x)$:\n$f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\frac{x^{2}}{3} - \\frac{2f(x)}{3x}$\n\n**Step 4:** Substitute into equation (2):\n$3f(x) + 2x\\left(\\frac{x^{2}}{3} - \\frac{2f(x)}{3x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$\n\n$3f(x) + \\frac{2x^3}{3} - \\frac{4f(x)}{3} = \\frac{1}{x^2}$\n\n$\\frac{9f(x) - 4f(x)}{3} = \\frac{1}{x^2} - \\frac{2x^3}{3}$\n\n$\\frac{5f(x)}{3} = \\frac{1}{x^2} - \\frac{2x^3}{3}$\n\n$f(x) = \\frac{3}{5x^2} - \\frac{2x^3}{5}$\n\n**Step 5:** Calculate $f(-2)$:\n$f(-2) = \\frac{3}{5(-2)^2} - \\frac{2(-2)^3}{5}$\n\n$= \\frac{3}{20} - \\frac{2(-8)}{5}$\n\n$= \\frac{3}{20} + \\frac{16}{5}$\n\n$= \\frac{3}{20} + \\frac{64}{20}$\n\n$= \\frac{67}{20}$\n\n## Problem 1: Triangle-free graphs\n\nThis problem asks for the count of triangle-free graphs on 10 labeled vertices with exactly 23 edges and maximum degree exactly 5, then subtract 37798.\n\nThis is an extremely difficult combinatorial enumeration problem. Triangle-free graphs with specific edge counts and degree constraints typically require computational enumeration or advanced combinatorial techniques. \n\nFor a graph on 10 vertices with 23 edges to be triangle-free and have maximum degree exactly 5, we need:\n- Sum of degrees = 2 × 23 = 46\n- At least one vertex with degree 5\n- No vertex with degree > 5\n- No three vertices forming a triangle\n\nThe maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on 10 vertices is 25 (by Turán's theorem, achieved by $K_{5,5}$), so 23 edges is close to this maximum.\n\nWithout computational tools or access to precomputed values, I cannot provide the exact numerical answer for $N_{\\Delta=5}$. This type of problem typically appears in contexts where such values have been computed previously or where computational resources are available.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 2 was solved by creating a system of equations through substitution and solving for f(x), yielding f(x) = 3/(5x²) - 2x³/5, giving f(-2) = 67/20.
