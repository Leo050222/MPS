  "reasoning_content": "## Problem 1 Solution\n\nI need to find a 4-digit perfect square $n = a^2$ where:\n- All digits are less than 6\n- Adding 1 to each digit gives another perfect square\n\nWhen we add 1 to each digit of a 4-digit number, we're adding $1000 + 100 + 10 + 1 = 1111$.\n\nSo if $n = a^2$ and $n + 1111 = b^2$, then:\n$$b^2 - a^2 = 1111$$\n$$(b-a)(b+a) = 1111$$\n\nFactoring: $1111 = 11 \\times 101$\n\nThe factor pairs are:\n- $(1, 1111)$: gives $b = 556, a = 555$\n  - Check: $555^2 = 308025$ (6 digits, not valid)\n  \n- $(11, 101)$: gives $b-a = 11, b+a = 101$\n  - $2b = 112 \\Rightarrow b = 56$\n  - $2a = 90 \\Rightarrow a = 45$\n\nVerification:\n- $45^2 = 2025$ (all digits < 6) ✓\n- $2025 + 1111 = 3136 = 56^2$ ✓\n\nTherefore, $a = 45$ and $m = a - 42 = 45 - 42 = 3$.\n\n## Problem 2 Solution\n\nGiven:\n- $P(1) = -4$ (by Remainder Theorem)\n- $P(2) = -1$\n- $P(3) = 4$\n\nFirst, verify that $x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$:\n$$(x-1)(x-2)(x-3) = (x-1)(x^2-5x+6) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6$$ ✓\n\nSince the divisor has degree 3, the remainder $R(x)$ has degree at most 2:\n$$R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$\n\nWe can write: $P(x) = Q(x)(x-1)(x-2)(x-3) + R(x)$\n\nThis means:\n- $R(1) = a + b + c = -4$\n- $R(2) = 4a + 2b + c = -1$\n- $R(3) = 9a + 3b + c = 4$\n\nSolving this system:\nFrom equation 2 - equation 1: $3a + b = 3$\nFrom equation 3 - equation 2: $5a + b = 5$\n\nSubtracting: $2a = 2 \\Rightarrow a = 1$\n\nTherefore: $b = 3 - 3(1) = 0$\n\nAnd: $c = -4 - a - b = -4 - 1 - 0 = -5$\n\nSo $R(x) = x^2 - 5$\n\nVerification:\n- $R(1) = 1 - 5 = -4$ ✓\n- $R(2) = 4 - 5 = -1$ ✓\n- $R(3) = 9 - 5 = 4$ ✓\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Found that n = 2025 = 45^2, where adding 1 to each digit gives 3136 = 56^2.
