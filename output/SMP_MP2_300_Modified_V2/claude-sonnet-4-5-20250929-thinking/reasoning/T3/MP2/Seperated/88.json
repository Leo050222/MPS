      "A2522": "In the game of Galactic Dominion, players compete to amass cards, each of which is worth a certain number of points. Say you are playing a version of this game with only two kinds of cards, planet cards and hegemon cards. Each planet card is worth 2010 points, and each hegemon card is worth four points per planet card held. You start with no planet cards and no hegemon cards, and, on each turn, starting at turn one, you take either a planet card or a hegemon card, whichever is worth more points given the hand you currently hold. Define a sequence $\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}$ for all positive integers $n$ by setting $a_{n}$ to be 0 if on turn $n$ you take a planet card and 1 if you take a hegemon card. What is the smallest value of $N$ such that the sequence $a_{N}, a_{N+1}, \\ldots$ is necessarily periodic (meaning that there is a positive integer $k$ such that $a_{n+k}=a_{n}$ for all $\\left.n \\geq N\\right)$ ? Instead of determining the minimal index from which the tail of the sequence is periodic, simply find \\(k = a_{502} + 9\\), where \\(a_{502}\\) is the term of the sequence at position 502 derived from the game's decision rules."

  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems, I'll solve them systematically.\n\n## Problem 1: Galactic Dominion Card Game\n\nLet me analyze the decision rule for taking cards.\n\n**Setting up the problem:**\n- Planet cards: worth 2010 points each\n- Hegemon cards: worth 4 points per planet card held\n- Current state: $p$ planet cards, $h$ hegemon cards\n\n**Marginal value analysis:**\n- Taking a planet card increases score by: $2010 + 4h$ (the planet's value plus the extra value added to all hegemon cards)\n- Taking a hegemon card increases score by: $4p$ (4 points times the number of planet cards)\n\n**Decision rule:**\n- Take planet card if $2010 + 4h > 4p$\n- Take hegemon card if $4p > 2010 + 4h$\n\nSimplifying: Take planet card if $p - h < 502.5$, i.e., $p - h \\leq 502$\n\n**Tracing the sequence:**\n- Turns 1-503: Start with $p=0, h=0$. Since $p-h=0 \\leq 502$, we take planet cards.\n  - After turn 502: $p=502, h=0$, so $p-h=502 \\leq 502$ → $a_{502} = 0$\n  - After turn 503: $p=503, h=0$, so $p-h=503 \\geq 503$\n  \n- Turn 504 onwards: $p-h$ oscillates between 502 and 503\n  - When $p-h=503$: take hegemon (reduces to 502)\n  - When $p-h=502$: take planet (increases to 503)\n  - Pattern: $a_{504}=1, a_{505}=0, a_{506}=1, a_{507}=0, ...$\n\nTherefore: $a_{502} = 0$\n\nThe answer is: $k = a_{502} + 9 = 0 + 9 = 9$\n\n## Problem 2: Maximizing Sum of Rational Numbers\n\nLet $x = \\frac{a}{b}$ and $y = \\frac{c}{d}$ in lowest terms.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- $a + c = 9$\n- $b + d = 10$\n- $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$ and $\\gcd(c,d) = 1$\n\n**Goal:** Maximize $x + y = \\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{c}{d}$\n\n**Strategy:** Since we want to maximize the sum, we should make one fraction as large as possible. This means having a large numerator and small denominator.\n\n**Testing cases systematically:**\n\nFor $b = 1$ (maximizing the first fraction):\n- If $a=8, b=1$: then $c=1, d=9$\n  - Check: $\\gcd(8,1)=1$ ✓, $\\gcd(1,9)=1$ ✓\n  - $x+y = 8 + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{73}{9}$\n\nFor $b = 9$ (minimizing the first fraction's denominator while keeping it >1):\n- If $a=1, b=9$: then $c=8, d=1$\n  - Check: $\\gcd(1,9)=1$ ✓, $\\gcd(8,1)=1$ ✓\n  - $x+y = \\frac{1}{9} + 8 = \\frac{73}{9}$\n\nTesting other values of $b$ (2 through 8):\n- $b=5$: When both denominators equal 5, $x+y = \\frac{9}{5} = 1.8$ (much smaller)\n- $b=3$ or $b=7$: Maximum around $\\frac{59}{21} \\approx 2.81$ (still smaller)\n- Other values either violate the gcd condition or give smaller sums\n\n**Verification of maximum:**\n$\\frac{73}{9} \\approx 8.111$ is indeed the largest value found.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: The decision rule is to take a planet card when p-h ≤ 502 and a hegemon card when p-h ≥ 503. For the first 503 turns, we take only planet cards, so a_502 = 0. Therefore k = 0 + 9 = 9. For Problem 2: To maximize x+y with constraints a+c=9 and b+d=10 (with fractions in lowest terms), we should maximize one fraction. Setting a=8, b=1, c=1, d=9 (or vice versa) gives x+y = 8 + 1/9 = 73/9, which is the maximum possible value.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"73/9\"\n}\n```",
