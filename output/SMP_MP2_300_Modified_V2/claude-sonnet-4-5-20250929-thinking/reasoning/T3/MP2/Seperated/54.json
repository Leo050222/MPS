  "reasoning_content": "Looking at both problems systematically:\n\n## Problem 1: Finding f(68)\n\nGiven: $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ is strictly increasing with $f(1)=1$ and \n$$f(2n)f(2n+1) = 9f(n)^2 + 3f(n)$$\n\nLet me compute the first few values:\n- $f(1) = 1$\n- For $n=1$: $f(2) \\cdot f(3) = 9(1)^2 + 3(1) = 12$\n\nSince $f$ is strictly increasing with $f(1)=1$, we need $f(2) < f(3)$ with their product being 12.\nTrying $f(2)=3, f(3)=4$:\n\n- For $n=2$: $f(4) \\cdot f(5) = 9(3)^2 + 3(3) = 90$, so $f(4)=9, f(5)=10$\n- For $n=3$: $f(6) \\cdot f(7) = 9(4)^2 + 3(4) = 156$, so $f(6)=12, f(7)=13$\n- For $n=4$: $f(8) \\cdot f(9) = 9(9)^2 + 3(9) = 756$, so $f(8)=27, f(9)=28$\n\nPattern recognition using binary representations:\n- $1 = 1_2$: $f(1) = 1$\n- $2 = 10_2$: $f(2) = 3 = 10_3$\n- $3 = 11_2$: $f(3) = 4 = 11_3$\n- $4 = 100_2$: $f(4) = 9 = 100_3$\n\n**The pattern**: $f(n)$ is obtained by interpreting the binary representation of $n$ as a base-3 number!\n\nVerification: If $n = b_k...b_1b_0$ in binary, then $f(n) = \\sum b_i \\cdot 3^i$\n\nFor $2n = b_k...b_1b_0\\mathbf{0}$: $f(2n) = 3f(n)$\nFor $2n+1 = b_k...b_1b_0\\mathbf{1}$: $f(2n+1) = 1 + 3f(n)$\n\nTherefore: $f(2n) \\cdot f(2n+1) = 3f(n)(1 + 3f(n)) = 3f(n) + 9f(n)^2$ ✓\n\nFor $f(68)$:\n$68 = 64 + 4 = 2^6 + 2^2 = 1000100_2$\n\nSo: $f(68) = 1 \\cdot 3^6 + 0 \\cdot 3^5 + 0 \\cdot 3^4 + 0 \\cdot 3^3 + 1 \\cdot 3^2 + 0 \\cdot 3^1 + 0 \\cdot 3^0$\n$= 729 + 9 = 738$\n\nTherefore: $k = f(68) - 730 = 738 - 730 = 8$\n\n## Problem 2: Counting Valid Cube Colorings\n\nWe need to count colorings where red vertices form an independent set (no two red vertices share an edge).\n\nKey observation: The cube graph is bipartite! Using coordinates $(x,y,z)$ where each is 0 or 1:\n- **Part A** (even parity): $(0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1)$\n- **Part B** (odd parity): $(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,1)$\n\nTwo vertices are adjacent iff they differ in exactly one coordinate (i.e., have different parities and Hamming distance 1).\n\nCounting independent sets by size:\n\n**Size 0**: 1 way (all blue)\n\n**Size 1**: 8 ways (any single vertex red)\n\n**Size 2**: \n- Within Part A: $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways\n- Within Part B: $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways  \n- Across parts (Hamming distance 3): 4 ways (the four main diagonals)\n- Total: $6 + 6 + 4 = 16$ ways\n\n**Size 3**: \nAn independent set of size 3 must have at least 2 vertices in the same part. If it has vertices from both parts, the vertex in the minority part must have Hamming distance 3 from both vertices in the majority part, which is impossible (checking shows no such vertex exists).\n- All in Part A: $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways\n- All in Part B: $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways\n- Total: $4 + 4 = 8$ ways\n\n**Size 4**:\n- All of Part A: 1 way (the tetrahedron $(0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1)$)\n- All of Part B: 1 way (the tetrahedron $(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,1)$)\n- Total: 2 ways\n\n**Total**: $1 + 8 + 16 + 8 + 2 = 35$\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: The function f(n) converts n's binary representation to base 3.
