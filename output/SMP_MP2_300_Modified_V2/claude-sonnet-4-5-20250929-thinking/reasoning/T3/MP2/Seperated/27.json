Every minute she walks forward one meter with probability $3 / 4$ and backward one meter with probability $1 / 4$. What is the probability that she reaches the end in front of her before the end behind her? Instead of computing the probability of reaching the forward end before the backward end in this biased random walk on a line, simply find $k = r + 2/3$, where $r$ is the ratio of the backward probability to the forward probability."
