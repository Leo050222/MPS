  "reasoning_content": "Looking at both problems, I'll solve them step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Friendship and Enmity Assignments\n\nLet me first understand the constraint: \"For any two enemies, there is no person that they are both friends with.\"\n\nIn graph theory terms, if we consider the friendship graph G:\n- An edge represents friendship\n- No edge represents enmity  \n- The constraint means: if vertices u and v are not adjacent (enemies), they cannot have a common neighbor\n\n**Claim:** This constraint means G must be a union of disjoint cliques.\n\n**Proof:** \n- If u and v are in the same connected component but not adjacent, any path between them would create a common neighbor at distance 2, violating the constraint\n- Therefore, each connected component must be complete (a clique)\n- Vertices in different components have no common neighbors\n\nFor 5 people, valid configurations correspond to partitions:\n1. [5]: One clique of 5 → 1 way\n2. [4,1]: Clique of 4 + isolated vertex → C(5,1) = 5 ways\n3. [3,2]: Clique of 3 + clique of 2 → C(5,2) = 10 ways\n4. [3,1,1]: Clique of 3 + two isolated → C(5,3) = 10 ways\n5. [2,2,1]: Two cliques of 2 + isolated → C(5,1)·C(4,2)/2 = 15 ways\n6. [2,1,1,1]: Clique of 2 + three isolated → C(5,2) = 10 ways\n7. [1,1,1,1,1]: Five isolated vertices → 1 way\n\nTotal = 52 configurations\n\n**Finding s:** The number of assignments where no two people are friends means the friendship graph has no edges (configuration [1,1,1,1,1]). There is exactly **s = 1** such assignment.\n\nTherefore: **q = s - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0**\n\n## Problem 2: Lattice Points in Triangle\n\nGiven vertices: A = (0,99), B = (5,100), C = (2003,500)\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Area**\n\nUsing the cross product formula:\n- Vector AB = (5, 1)\n- Vector AC = (2003, 401)\n- Area = ½|5·401 - 1·2003| = ½|2005 - 2003| = ½·2 = **1**\n\n**Step 2: Count Boundary Points**\n\nFor each edge, lattice points = gcd(|Δx|, |Δy|) + 1:\n\n*Edge AB:* (0,99) to (5,100)\n- gcd(5, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 points\n\n*Edge BC:* (5,100) to (2003,500)\n- gcd(1998, 400) = gcd(1998, 400)\n- 1998 = 4·400 + 398\n- 400 = 1·398 + 2  \n- 398 = 199·2 + 0\n- gcd = 2, so 2 + 1 = 3 points\n\n*Edge CA:* (2003,500) to (0,99)\n- gcd(2003, 401) = gcd(2003, 401)\n- 2003 = 4·401 + 399\n- 401 = 1·399 + 2\n- 399 = 199·2 + 1\n- 2 = 2·1 + 0\n- gcd = 1, so 1 + 1 = 2 points\n\nTotal boundary points: B = 2 + 3 + 2 - 3 = **4** (subtract 3 for vertices counted twice)\n\n**Step 3: Apply Pick's Theorem**\n\nPick's theorem: A = I + B/2 - 1\n\nSolving for I (interior points):\n- 1 = I + 4/2 - 1\n- 1 = I + 2 - 1\n- 1 = I + 1\n- **I = 0**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: The constraint requires the friendship graph to be a union of disjoint cliques. With no friendships (all enemies), there's exactly 1 such configuration, so s = 1 and q = 0. For Problem 2: Using Pick's theorem with area = 1 and boundary points = 4, we get I = A - B/2 + 1 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0 interior points.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"0\"\n}\n```",
