      "A401": "Trevor and Edward play a game in which they take turns adding or removing beans from a pile. On each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. The player who empties the pile wins. For example, if Trevor goes first with a pile of 5 beans, he can either add 4 to make the total 9, or remove 4 to make the total 1, and either way Edward wins by removing all the beans. There is no limit to how large the pile can grow; it just starts with some finite number of beans in it, say fewer than 1000. Before the game begins, Edward dispatches a spy to find out how many beans will be in the opening pile, call this $n$, then \"graciously\" offers to let Trevor go first. Knowing that the first player is more likely to win, but not knowing $n$, Trevor logically but unwisely accepts, and Edward goes on to win the game. Find a number $n$ less than 1000 that would prompt this scenario, assuming both players are perfect logicians. A correct answer is worth the nearest integer to $\\log _{2}(n-4)$ points. Instead of finding an initial pile size $n$ less than 1000 that is a losing position for the first player under perfect play, simply find $k = s(p) - 6$, where $p$ is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example, and $s(p)$ is the largest perfect square at most $p$."

  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems:\n\n## Problem 1 Analysis\n\nLet me carefully parse what's being asked. The problem states: \"find $k = s(p) - 6$, where $p$ is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example, and $s(p)$ is the largest perfect square at most $p$.\"\n\nIn the example given:\n- Initial pile: 5 beans\n- The largest perfect square at most 5 is 4\n- Adding this gives: $p = 5 + 4 = 9$\n- The largest perfect square at most $p = 9$ is $s(9) = 9$\n- Therefore: $k = s(p) - 6 = 9 - 6 = 3$\n\n## Problem 2 Analysis\n\nWe need to count colorings of a tetrahedron's vertices with 3 colors (R, G, B) such that no face is monochromatic, accounting for rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 1: Count valid colorings without symmetry**\n\nA tetrahedron has 4 vertices and 4 faces. Label vertices as 1,2,3,4 with faces:\n- Face A: {1,2,3}\n- Face B: {1,2,4}  \n- Face C: {1,3,4}\n- Face D: {2,3,4}\n\nTotal colorings: $3^4 = 81$\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion to count invalid (monochromatic face) colorings:\n- Single monochromatic face: 9 colorings each, 4 faces → $4 \\times 9 = 36$\n- Two monochromatic faces: All vertices same color → 3 colorings, $\\binom{4}{2}$ pairs → $6 \\times 3 = 18$\n- Three or more: Still 3 colorings for all combinations\n\nBy inclusion-exclusion: $36 - 18 + 12 - 3 = 27$ invalid colorings\n\nValid colorings: $81 - 27 = 54$\n\n**Step 2: Apply Burnside's Lemma**\n\nThe rotation group of a tetrahedron has 12 elements:\n- 1 identity\n- 8 rotations by 120°/240° around vertex-to-opposite-face axes\n- 3 rotations by 180° around opposite edge midpoints\n\n**Fixed colorings for each rotation type:**\n\n*Identity:* All 54 valid colorings are fixed.\n\n*Rotations around a vertex (8 rotations):* \nFor a coloring to be fixed, the 3 non-fixed vertices must have the same color. This makes the face formed by these 3 vertices monochromatic, violating our constraint. \nFixed colorings: 0\n\n*Rotations by 180° around edge midpoints (3 rotations):*\nConsider rotation swapping vertices {1,2} and {3,4}. For a coloring to be fixed:\n- $c(1) = c(2)$ and $c(3) = c(4)$\n- For no monochromatic face: $c(1) \\neq c(3)$\n\nThis gives $3 \\times 2 = 6$ valid fixed colorings (3 choices for first pair's color, 2 for second pair).\n\n**Burnside's Lemma calculation:**\n$$\\text{Distinct colorings} = \\frac{1}{12}(54 \\times 1 + 0 \\times 8 + 6 \\times 3) = \\frac{72}{12} = 6$$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I traced through the example: starting with 5 beans, the largest perfect square ≤ 5 is 4, so adding gives p = 9. The largest perfect square ≤ 9 is s(9) = 9, thus k = 9 - 6 = 3. For Problem 2, I counted valid colorings (54 total) where no face is monochromatic, then applied Burnside's lemma with the 12 rotational symmetries of the tetrahedron. The identity fixes all 54 colorings, rotations around vertices fix 0 valid colorings, and 180° rotations around edge midpoints fix 6 valid colorings each, giving (54 + 0×8 + 6×3)/12 = 6 distinct colorings.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
