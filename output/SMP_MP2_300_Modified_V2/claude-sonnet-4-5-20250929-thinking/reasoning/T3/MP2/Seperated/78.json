The smallest case is $\\lfloor \\alpha \\rfloor = 2017$, so $2017 \\leq \\alpha < 2018$.\n\n- For $n=2$: We need $\\lfloor \\alpha^2 \\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$ as well.\n\nWriting $\\alpha = 2017 + \\epsilon$ where $0 < \\epsilon < 1$ (assuming $k=1$):\n$$\\alpha^2 = (2017 + \\epsilon)^2 = 2017^2 + 2 \\cdot 2017\\epsilon + \\epsilon^2$$\n\nFor $\\lfloor \\alpha^2 \\rfloor$ to be divisible by 2017:\n$$\\lfloor 2 \\cdot 2017\\epsilon + \\epsilon^2 \\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$$\n\nSince $0 < \\epsilon < 1$, we have $0 < 2 \\cdot 2017\\epsilon + \\epsilon^2 < 4035$, so $\\lfloor 2 \\cdot 2017\\epsilon + \\epsilon^2 \\rfloor$ must be $0$, $2017$, or $4034$.\n\nAs $n$ increases, the constraints on $\\alpha$ become increasingly restrictive. For large $n$, we need:\n$$2017m_n \\leq \\alpha^n < 2017m_n + 1$$\n\nTaking $n$-th roots: $(2017m_n)^{1/n} \\leq \\alpha < (2017m_n + 1)^{1/n}$\n\nThe width of this interval approaches 0 as $n \\to \\infty$, making it impossible for a single irrational $\\alpha$ to satisfy all these constraints simultaneously. The constraints from different values of $n$ would eventually become incompatible.\n\nTherefore, **no such irrational number exists**.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Found the derivative Q'(x) = 2x + 2, which has root r = -1. Then Q(-1) = 2, so k = Q(r) - 1 = 1. For Problem 2: If such an α existed, it would need to satisfy increasingly restrictive constraints for each n. The intervals that α must lie in become arbitrarily small as n increases, making it impossible for any single irrational α to satisfy all conditions simultaneously.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}\n```",
