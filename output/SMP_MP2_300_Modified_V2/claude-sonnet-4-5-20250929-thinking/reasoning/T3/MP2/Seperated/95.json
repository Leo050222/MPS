  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems:\n\n## Problem 1: Finding prime numbers p, q, r\n\nStarting with the equation:\n$$\\frac{p}{q} - \\frac{4}{r+1} = 1$$\n\nRearranging:\n$$\\frac{p}{q} = 1 + \\frac{4}{r+1} = \\frac{r+1+4}{r+1} = \\frac{r+5}{r+1}$$\n\nFor $p$ and $q$ to be prime, we need $\\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{r+5}{r+1}$ in lowest terms.\n\nLet $d = \\gcd(r+5, r+1) = \\gcd(4, r+1)$ (since $\\gcd(r+5, r+1) = \\gcd(r+5-(r+1), r+1) = \\gcd(4, r+1)$).\n\nThen $p = \\frac{r+5}{d}$ and $q = \\frac{r+1}{d}$.\n\n**Case 1:** $d = 1$ (when $r$ is even)\n- Since $r$ is prime and even: $r = 2$\n- Then $p = 7, q = 3$ ✓\n\n**Case 2:** $d = 2$ (when $r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$)\n- We need both $\\frac{r+5}{2}$ and $\\frac{r+1}{2}$ to be prime\n- This gives us twin primes: $q = \\frac{r+1}{2}$ and $p = q + 2$\n- For $r = 5$: $q = 3, p = 5$ ✓\n\n**Case 3:** $d = 4$ (when $r \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$)\n- We need $p = \\frac{r+5}{4}$ and $q = \\frac{r+1}{4}$ both prime\n- This means $p = q + 1$, so consecutive primes (only 2 and 3)\n- With $q = 2, p = 3$: $r + 1 = 8$, so $r = 7$ ✓\n\nThe three solutions are: $(p,q,r) = (7,3,2), (5,3,5), (3,2,7)$\n\nThe largest value is $r = 7$, so $n = r + 2009 = 7 + 2009 = 2016$.\n\n## Problem 2: Random walk on 8×8 torus\n\nFemtoPravis moves diagonally on an $8 \\times 8$ torus. Each diagonal move can be decomposed into independent moves in the $x$ and $y$ directions. Each coordinate follows a simple symmetric random walk on $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ where each step is $\\pm 1$ (mod 8) with equal probability.\n\nFor a random walk on $\\mathbb{Z}_8$, the probability of returning to 0 after $n$ steps is:\n$$P(S_n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}) = \\frac{1}{8} \\sum_{j=0}^{7} \\cos^n\\left(\\frac{\\pi j}{4}\\right)$$\n\nFor $n = 2012$:\n$$P(S_{2012} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}) = \\frac{1}{8}\\left[\\cos^{2012}(0) + \\cos^{2012}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + \\cos^{2012}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\cdots + \\cos^{2012}\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\right)\\right]$$\n\nEvaluating each term:\n- $\\cos(0) = 1$\n- $\\cos(\\pi/4) = \\cos(7\\pi/4) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n- $\\cos(\\pi/2) = \\cos(3\\pi/2) = 0$\n- $\\cos(3\\pi/4) = \\cos(5\\pi/4) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n- $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$\n\nSince 2012 is even:\n$$P(S_{2012} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}) = \\frac{1}{8}\\left[1 + 4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^{2012} + 1\\right] = \\frac{1}{8}\\left[2 + 4 \\cdot 2^{-1006}\\right] = \\frac{1}{8}\\left[2 + 2^{-1004}\\right]$$\n\n$$= \\frac{2^{1005} + 1}{2^{1007}}$$\n\nSince $X$ and $Y$ are independent:\n$$P(\\text{return to origin}) = \\left(\\frac{2^{1005} + 1}{2^{1007}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(2^{1005} + 1)^2}{2^{2014}}$$\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Solved the equation to find that (p,q,r) can be (7,3,2), (5,3,5), or (3,2,7).
