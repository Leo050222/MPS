  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems, I'll solve them step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nWe need $n^n - 1 \\equiv 0$ modulo $2, 3, 5, 7$, which means $n^n \\equiv 1$ modulo each of these primes.\n\n**Analysis for mod 2:**\nIf $n$ is even, then $n^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, which doesn't satisfy $n^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\nTherefore, $n$ must be odd.\n\n**Analysis for mod 3:**\n- If $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $n^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, which doesn't work.\n- If $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $n^n \\equiv 1^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. ✓\n- If $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then by Fermat's Little Theorem, $n^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. Since $n$ must be odd (from above), we have $n^n \\equiv n^{2k+1} \\equiv n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, which doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince $n$ must be coprime to both 2 and 3, we have $\\gcd(n, 6) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, $m = \\gcd(n, 6) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nThe polynomial $x^4 - ax^3 + bx^2 - ax + d = 0$ has a symmetric structure (coefficients of $x^3$ and $x$ are equal).\n\nThis suggests the polynomial might have the reciprocal property. If $d = 1$, then the polynomial $x^4 - ax^3 + bx^2 - ax + 1 = 0$ has the property that if $r$ is a root, then $1/r$ is also a root.\n\nGiven all roots are in $[1/2, 2]$, we can have roots of the form: $r, 1/r, s, 1/s$ where $r, s \\in [1/2, 1]$.\n\nLet's assign: $x_1 = r$, $x_2 = 1/r$, $x_3 = s$, $x_4 = 1/s$.\n\nThe expression becomes:\n$$\\frac{(x_1+x_2)(x_1+x_3)x_4}{(x_4+x_2)(x_4+x_3)x_1}$$\n\nSubstituting:\n$$\\frac{(r+1/r)(r+s)(1/s)}{(1/s+1/r)(1/s+s)r}$$\n\nSimplifying:\n$$= \\frac{(r+1/r)(r+s)/(s)}{r \\cdot \\frac{r+s}{rs} \\cdot \\frac{1+s^2}{s}}$$\n\n$$= \\frac{(r+1/r)s^2}{r(1+s^2)}$$\n\n$$= \\frac{(r^2+1)s^2}{r(1+s^2)}$$\n\n$$= (r + 1/r) \\cdot \\frac{s^2}{1+s^2}$$\n\nTo maximize:\n- $(r + 1/r)$ is maximized when $r = 1/2$, giving $1/2 + 2 = 5/2$\n- $\\frac{s^2}{1+s^2}$ is maximized when $s = 1$, giving $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nAt $r = 1/2, s = 1$ (which gives roots $1/2, 2, 1, 1$):\n$$\\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{4}$$\n\nWe can verify: with roots $x_1=1/2, x_2=2, x_3=1, x_4=1$:\n$$\\frac{(1/2+2)(1/2+1)(1)}{(1+2)(1+1)(1/2)} = \\frac{(5/2)(3/2)}{3 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{15/4}{3} = \\frac{5}{4}$$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, analyzing the conditions $n^n \\\\equiv 1$ modulo 2 and 3 shows that n must be coprime to both primes, giving $\\\\gcd(n,6) = 1$, hence $m = 0$. For Problem 2, using the reciprocal property of the symmetric polynomial and optimizing the expression over roots in [1/2, 2], the maximum value is achieved at roots 1/2, 2, 1, 1, yielding 5/4.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"5/4\"\n}",
