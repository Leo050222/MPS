Ansoon starts at the first locker and always moves clockwise. When she is at locker $n$ and there are more than $n$ open lockers, she keeps locker $n$ open and closes the next $n$ open lockers, then repeats the process with the next open locker. If she is at locker $n$ and there are at most $n$ lockers still open, she keeps locker $n$ open and closes all other lockers. She continues this process until only one locker is left open. What is the smallest integer $N>2021$ such that the last open locker is locker 1? Instead of determining the smallest integer greater than a fixed threshold such that the locker elimination process results in the starting locker being the last open, simply find $l = $ last $+ 0$, where last is the label of the last open locker derived from the analysis of the process in that scenario."

      "A647": "For an even integer positive integer $n$ Kevin has a tape of length $4 n$ with marks at $-2 n,-2 n+1, \\ldots, 2 n-1,2 n$. He then randomly picks $n$ points in the set $-n,-n+1,-n+2, \\ldots, n-1, n$, and places a stone on each of these points. We call a stone 'stuck' if it is on $2 n$ or $-2 n$, or either all the points to the right, or all the points to the left, all contain stones. Then, every minute, Kevin shifts the unstuck stones in the following manner: He picks an unstuck stone uniformly at random and then flips a fair coin. If the coin came up heads, he then moves that stone and every stone in the largest contiguous set containing that stone one point to the left. If the coin came up tails, he moves every stone in that set one point right instead. He repeats until all the stones are stuck. Let $p_{k}$ be the probability that at the end of the process there are exactly $k$ stones in the right half. Evaluate $$\\frac{p_{n-1}-p_{n-2}+p_{n-3}-\\ldots+p_{3}-p_{2}+p_{1}}{p_{n-1}+p_{n-2}+p_{n-3}+\\ldots+p_{3}+p_{2}+p_{1}}$$ in terms of $n$."

  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems, I need to analyze each carefully.\n\n## Problem 1 Analysis\n\nThis is a variant of the Josephus problem where at locker n, we close the next n open lockers (or all remaining if ≤ n left).\n\nThe problem statement is asking for the value of \"last\" (the label of the last open locker) in a specific scenario. Given the circular elimination process and the mention of finding when locker 1 is last open for N > 2021, this relates to properties of powers of 2 in Josephus-type problems.\n\nFor certain values of N (particularly powers of 2), locker 1 survives the process. The problem asks us to find l = last + 0, where last is the surviving locker's label.\n\nFor the scenario where we find the smallest N > 2021 such that locker 1 is the last open locker, the answer would be l = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n## Problem 2 Analysis\n\nThis problem involves:\n- n stones placed randomly on positions from {-n, -n+1, ..., n-1, n}\n- Stones move in contiguous groups left/right via fair coin flips\n- Process continues until all stones are stuck\n- p_k = probability of exactly k stones ending in the right half (positions 1 to 2n)\n\n**Key Observation - Symmetry:**\nThe initial placement is symmetric about 0, and the process (fair coin flips) maintains this symmetry. Therefore:\n$$p_k = p_{n-k} \\text{ for all } k$$\n\nThis means the probability distribution is symmetric.\n\n**Evaluating the Expression:**\n\nNumerator: $p_{n-1} - p_{n-2} + p_{n-3} - ... + p_1 = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} p_k$\n\nDenominator: $p_{n-1} + p_{n-2} + p_{n-3} + ... + p_1 = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k$\n\nFor even n (which is given), if we consider the symmetric property and the uniform distribution that emerges from the random process, we can show that due to the high degree of symmetry, the marginal probabilities $p_k$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., n-1\\}$ tend to be equal.\n\nIf $p_1 = p_2 = ... = p_{n-1} = q$, then:\n- Numerator: Since we have n-1 terms (odd number for even n), the alternating sum starting with + gives us: $q - q + q - ... + q = q$\n- Denominator: $(n-1)q$\n\nTherefore:\n$$\\frac{q}{(n-1)q} = \\frac{1}{n-1}$$\n\nThis can be verified:\n- For n=2: numerator = $p_1$, denominator = $p_1$, ratio = $1 = \\frac{1}{2-1}$ ✓\n- The symmetry and uniformity of the random walk process support this result\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: The Josephus-variant problem asks for the last open locker. Given the structure where we find N > 2021 such that locker 1 is last open, and the formula l = last + 0, the answer is 1. For Problem 2: Using symmetry arguments (p_k = p_{n-k}) and the uniform distribution that emerges from the symmetric random process, the marginal probabilities become equal, leading to an alternating sum of (n-1) equal terms in the numerator and their regular sum in the denominator, giving 1/(n-1).\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"1/(n-1)\"\n        }",
