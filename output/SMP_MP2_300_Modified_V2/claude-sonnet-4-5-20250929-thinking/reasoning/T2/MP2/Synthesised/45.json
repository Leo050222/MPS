  "math_problem": "Define $\\varphi^{k}(n)$ as the number of positive integers that are less than or equal to $n / k$ and relatively prime to $n$. Find $\\phi^{2001}\\left(2002^{2}-1\\right)$. (Hint: $\\phi(2003)=2002$.) Instead of determining $\\varphi^k(n)$ as defined for the given argument and superscript, simply find $q = \\gcd(m, k) + k$, where $k$ is the superscript used in $\\varphi^k(n)$, and $m$ is the positive integer for which the argument of $\\varphi$ is $m^2 - 1$. The real function $f$ has the property that, whenever $a, b, n$ are positive integers such that $a+b=2^{n}$, the equation $f(a)+f(b)=n^{2}$ holds. What is $f(q)$?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to first find $q$, then find $f(q)$.\n\n## Step 1: Finding $q = \\gcd(m, k) + k$\n\nFrom the problem:\n- $k = 2001$ (the superscript in $\\varphi^{2001}$)\n- $m = 2002$ (since the argument is $m^2 - 1 = 2002^2 - 1$)\n\nTo find $\\gcd(2002, 2001)$:\n\nSince $2002 = 2001 + 1$, we have:\n$$\\gcd(2002, 2001) = \\gcd(2001 + 1, 2001) = \\gcd(1, 2001) = 1$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$q = \\gcd(2002, 2001) + 2001 = 1 + 2001 = 2002$$\n\n## Step 2: Finding $f(2002)$\n\nNow I need to find $f(2002)$ where $f$ satisfies the functional equation:\nFor positive integers $a, b, n$ such that $a + b = 2^n$, we have $f(a) + f(b) = n^2$.\n\nI'll use the recursive relation: if $a + b = 2^n$, then $f(a) = n^2 - f(b)$.\n\n**Finding $f(2002)$:**\n\nSince $2^{11} = 2048$ and $2002 + 46 = 2048$:\n$$f(2002) + f(46) = 11^2 = 121$$\n\n**Finding $f(46)$:**\n\nSince $2^6 = 64$ and $46 + 18 = 64$:\n$$f(46) + f(18) = 6^2 = 36$$\n\n**Finding $f(18)$:**\n\nSince $2^5 = 32$ and $18 + 14 = 32$:\n$$f(18) + f(14) = 5^2 = 25$$\n\n**Finding $f(14)$:**\n\nSince $2^4 = 16$ and $14 + 2 = 16$:\n$$f(14) + f(2) = 4^2 = 16$$\n\n**Finding $f(2)$:**\n\nSince $2^2 = 4$ and $2 + 2 = 4$:\n$$f(2) + f(2) = 2^2 = 4$$\n$$2f(2) = 4$$\n$$f(2) = 2$$\n\n## Step 3: Working backwards\n\nNow I can calculate:\n- $f(14) = 16 - f(2) = 16 - 2 = 14$\n- $f(18) = 25 - f(14) = 25 - 14 = 11$\n- $f(46) = 36 - f(18) = 36 - 11 = 25$\n- $f(2002) = 121 - f(46) = 121 - 25 = 96$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found q = gcd(2002, 2001) + 2001. Since 2002 = 2001 + 1, gcd(2002, 2001) = 1, so q = 2002. Then I used the functional equation f(a) + f(b) = n^2 when a + b = 2^n to find f(2002) recursively. Starting from f(2) = 2 (from 2+2=4 and f(2)+f(2)=4), I worked through: f(14) = 16-2 = 14, f(18) = 25-14 = 11, f(46) = 36-11 = 25, and finally f(2002) = 121-25 = 96.\",\n    \"answer\": \"96\"\n}",
