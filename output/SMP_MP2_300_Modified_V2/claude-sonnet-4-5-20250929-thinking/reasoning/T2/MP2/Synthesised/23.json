  "math_problem": "Find all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of positive integers such that $2 a+1$ divides $3 b-1$ and $2 b+1$ divides $3 a-1$. Instead of determining all such ordered pairs, simply find $k = b - 14$, where $(a, b)$ is the ordered pair satisfying the divisibility conditions in which the second component exceeds the first. Meghana writes two (not necessarily distinct) primes $q$ and $r$ in base $(k + 7)$ next to each other on a blackboard, resulting in the concatenation of $q$ and $r$ (for example, if $q=(k + 10)$ and $r=(k + 2)$, the number on the blackboard is now $(k + 132)$). She notices that $k$ more than the resulting number is the square of a prime $p$. Find all possible values of $p$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve it in two stages.\n\n## Stage 1: Finding the ordered pair (a,b) with b > a\n\nI need to find positive integers $(a,b)$ such that:\n- $(2a+1) | (3b-1)$\n- $(2b+1) | (3a-1)$\n\nLet me check small values systematically.\n\n**Testing (a,b) = (2,2):**\n- $2a+1 = 5$ and $3b-1 = 5$, so $5|5$ ✓\n- $2b+1 = 5$ and $3a-1 = 5$, so $5|5$ ✓\n\nThis works! But $b = a$ here.\n\n**Testing (a,b) = (17,12):**\n- $2a+1 = 35$ and $3b-1 = 36-1 = 35$, so $35|35$ ✓\n- $2b+1 = 25$ and $3a-1 = 51-1 = 50$, so $25|50$ ✓\n\nThis works with $a > b$.\n\n**Testing (a,b) = (12,17):**\n- $2a+1 = 25$ and $3b-1 = 51-1 = 50$, so $25|50$ ✓\n- $2b+1 = 35$ and $3a-1 = 36-1 = 35$, so $35|35$ ✓\n\nThis works with $b > a$! \n\nTherefore, the ordered pair with $b > a$ is $(12, 17)$.\n\nThus: $k = b - 14 = 17 - 14 = 3$\n\n## Stage 2: Finding prime p\n\nNow I work in base $(k+7) = 3+7 = 10$ (standard base 10).\n\nMeghana concatenates two primes $q$ and $r$, and the resulting number plus $k=3$ equals $p^2$ for some prime $p$.\n\nSo I need: (concatenation of $q$ and $r$) $+ 3 = p^2$\n\nLet me check systematically for small primes:\n\n**$q=2, r=2$:**\nConcatenation = 22\n$22 + 3 = 25 = 5^2$ ✓\n$p = 5$ is prime! ✓\n\n**Testing other small combinations:**\n- $q=2, r=3$: $23+3=26$ (not a perfect square)\n- $q=2, r=5$: $25+3=28$ (not a perfect square)\n- $q=2, r=7$: $27+3=30$ (not a perfect square)\n- $q=3, r=3$: $33+3=36=6^2$ (but 6 is not prime)\n- $q=3, r=7$: $37+3=40$ (not a perfect square)\n\n**Analyzing constraints:**\n\nFor the concatenation $N = 10q + r$ (when $r$ is single-digit):\n$N + 3 = p^2$\n\nIf $r=2$: $10q + 5 = p^2$\nThis means $p^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}$, which only occurs when $p \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}$.\nFor prime $p$, this means $p = 5$ (since any larger prime ending in 5 is divisible by 5).\n\nWhen $p=5$: $25 = 10q + 5$, giving $q = 2$ (prime) ✓\n\nFor other single-digit primes $r$, checking shows that $p^2 - 3$ doesn't yield values ending in those primes or doesn't give prime $p$.\n\nFor multi-digit cases with larger $p$, I need both parts of the split to be prime, which becomes increasingly rare. Checking up through $p = 100$ and various strategic values yields no other solutions.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found that the ordered pair (a,b) with b > a satisfying the divisibility conditions is (12, 17), giving k = 3. Then, working in base 10, I need a concatenation of two primes q and r such that the concatenation plus 3 equals p^2 for prime p. Testing systematically, only q=2, r=2 works, giving 22+3=25=5^2. Therefore p=5 is the only solution.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
