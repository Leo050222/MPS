  "math_problem": "Compute all ordered triples $(x, y, z)$ of real numbers satisfying the following system of equations: $$\\begin{aligned} x y+z & =40 \\\\\\\\ x z+y & =51 \\\\\\\\ x+y+z & =19 \\end{aligned}$$ Instead of computing all ordered triples of real numbers satisfying the system of equations, simply find $k = z + \\frac{17}{5}$, where $z$ is the third component in the solution corresponding to the smaller root for $x + 1$ among the roots of the quadratic equation derived from the system. There are 21 competitors with distinct skill levels numbered $1,2, \\ldots, 21$. They participate in a pingpong tournament as follows. First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill $k$. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to first solve the system of equations to find $k$, then solve the tournament problem.\n\n## Part 1: Finding $k$\n\nGiven system:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nxy + z &= 40 \\\\\nxz + y &= 51 \\\\\nx + y + z &= 19\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nFrom equation (3): $z = 19 - x - y$\n\nSubstituting into equation (1):\n$$xy + 19 - x - y = 40$$\n$$xy - x - y = 21$$\n\nSubstituting $z = 19 - x - y$ into equation (2):\n$$x(19 - x - y) + y = 51$$\n$$19x - x^2 - xy + y = 51$$\n\nFrom our earlier result, $xy = 21 + x + y$, so:\n$$19x - x^2 - (21 + x + y) + y = 51$$\n$$19x - x^2 - 21 - x = 51$$\n$$-x^2 + 18x = 72$$\n$$x^2 - 18x + 72 = 0$$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$$x = \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{324 - 288}}{2} = \\frac{18 \\pm 6}{2}$$\n\nSo $x = 12$ or $x = 6$.\n\n**For $x = 6$:**\n$$6y - 6 - y = 21 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{27}{5}$$\n$$z = 19 - 6 - \\frac{27}{5} = \\frac{38}{5}$$\n\n**For $x = 12$:**\n$$12y - 12 - y = 21 \\Rightarrow y = 3$$\n$$z = 19 - 12 - 3 = 4$$\n\nThe roots for $x + 1$ are: $7$ (from $x=6$) and $13$ (from $x=12$).\n\nThe smaller root is $7$, corresponding to $x = 6$ and $z = \\frac{38}{5}$.\n\nTherefore:\n$$k = z + \\frac{17}{5} = \\frac{38}{5} + \\frac{17}{5} = \\frac{55}{5} = 11$$\n\n## Part 2: Tournament Problem\n\nAlice has skill level $k = 11$ among 21 competitors.\n- She beats players with skills 1-10 (10 players)\n- She loses to players with skills 12-21 (10 players)\n\nIn this tournament:\n- 20 rounds total (eliminating 20 players)\n- Each round involves exactly 2 players\n- Total \"player-games\" = $2 \\times 20 = 40$\n\nFor this specific tournament format, I'll use a key insight: the expected number of games for a player depends on their position relative to all players.\n\nFor a player with skill $k$ out of $n$ players, where there are $k-1$ weaker players and $n-k$ stronger players, the expected number of games they play is:\n\n$$E = \\frac{2(k-1)}{n}$$\n\nThis comes from the probability structure: Alice expects to \"encounter\" each weaker player with probability $\\frac{2}{n}$ (considering both could be chosen in various roles).\n\nFor Alice with $k = 11$ and $n = 21$:\n$$E = \\frac{2(11-1)}{21} = \\frac{2 \\times 10}{21} = \\frac{20}{21}$$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I solved the system of equations to find k=11. The quadratic x²-18x+72=0 gives roots x=6 and x=12, corresponding to x+1=7 and x+1=13. The smaller root gives z=38/5, so k=z+17/5=11. For the tournament, Alice has skill 11 among 21 players. Using the tournament structure where 20 rounds occur with 2 players per round, and considering Alice beats 10 weaker players and loses to 10 stronger players, the expected number of games is 2(k-1)/n = 2(10)/21 = 20/21.\",\n    \"answer\": \"20/21\"\n}",
