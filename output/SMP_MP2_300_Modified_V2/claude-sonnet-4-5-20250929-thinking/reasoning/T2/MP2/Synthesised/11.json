  "math_problem": "During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^{2}$. Instead of determining the real part of the square of the starting point, simply find $k = |z| - 1$, where $|z|$ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days. Bob's Rice ID number has six digits, each a number from 1 to 9, and any digit can be used any number of times. The ID number satisfies the following property: the first two digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo $(k + 2)$, the first three digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo $(k + 3)$, the first four digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo $(k + 4)$, the first five digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 5, and the ID number itself is congruent to $k$ modulo 6. One ID number that satisfies this condition is 123252. How many different possibilities are there for Bob's ID number?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to first solve for $k = |z| - 1$ from the complex plane delivery problem, then use that value to count valid ID numbers.\n\n## Part 1: Finding k\n\nOn Saturday, Eli goes from $z$ to $z^{2013}$. The straight-line distance is:\n$$|z^{2013} - z| = |z||z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012}$$\n\nOn Sunday, Eli goes from $1$ to $z^{2012}$. The straight-line distance is:\n$$|z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012}$$\n\nFrom these two equations:\n- $|z||z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012}$\n- $|z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012}$\n\nDividing the first by the second: $|z| = 1$\n\nTherefore: $k = |z| - 1 = 0$\n\n## Part 2: Counting Valid ID Numbers\n\nWith $k = 0$, the conditions become:\n1. First two digits ≡ 0 (mod 2)\n2. First three digits ≡ 0 (mod 3)\n3. First four digits ≡ 0 (mod 4)\n4. First five digits ≡ 0 (mod 5)\n5. Full six digits ≡ 0 (mod 6)\n\nLet the ID be $d_1d_2d_3d_4d_5d_6$ where each $d_i \\in \\{1,2,...,9\\}$.\n\n**Simplifying the conditions:**\n\n1. $10d_1 + d_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$ → $d_2$ is even → $d_2 \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\}$ (4 choices)\n\n2. $100d_1 + 10d_2 + d_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ → $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$\n\n3. $1000d_1 + 100d_2 + 10d_3 + d_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$ → $2d_3 + d_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$\n\n4. Last digit condition: $d_5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ → $d_5 = 5$ (1 choice)\n\n5. Divisible by 6 means divisible by both 2 and 3:\n   - Divisible by 2: $d_6$ even → $d_6 \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\}$\n   - Divisible by 3: $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 + d_6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$\n\nFrom conditions 2 and 5: Since $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^6 d_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, we get:\n$$d_4 + d_5 + d_6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$$\n\nSince $d_5 = 5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, we need: $d_4 + d_6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$\n\n**Counting:**\n\nFor each $(d_1, d_2)$ pair:\n- $d_1$: 9 choices\n- $d_2$: 4 choices (even)\n- $d_3$: Must satisfy $d_3 \\equiv -(d_1 + d_2) \\pmod{3}$. For each residue class mod 3, there are exactly 3 values in $\\{1,...,9\\}$, giving 3 choices.\n\nFor each $d_3$, I need to count valid $(d_4, d_6)$ pairs where:\n- $d_4 \\equiv -2d_3 \\pmod{4}$\n- $d_6 \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\}$ and $d_4 + d_6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$\n\nBy checking all 9 values of $d_3$:\n- Each value of $d_3$ determines $d_4 \\pmod{4}$, giving 2 possible values for $d_4$ from $\\{1,...,9\\}$\n- For each such $d_4$, the constraint $d_4 + d_6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ with $d_6 \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\}$ gives either 1 or 2 choices for $d_6$\n- Careful enumeration shows that for each $d_3$, there are exactly **3 valid $(d_4, d_6)$ pairs**\n\n**Final count:**\n$$9 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 324$$\n\nwhere the factors represent choices for $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_3$, $(d_4,d_6)$ pairs, and $d_5$ respectively.\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"From the complex plane problem, |z| = 1, so k = 0. With k = 0, the ID constraints simplify to specific divisibility conditions.
