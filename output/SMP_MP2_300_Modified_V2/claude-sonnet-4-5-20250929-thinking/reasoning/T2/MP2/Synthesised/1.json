  "math_problem": "A jar contains 8 red balls and 2 blue balls. Every minute, a ball is randomly removed. The probability that there exists a time during this process where there are more blue balls than red balls in the jar can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime integers $a$ and $b$. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing 100 times the numerator plus the denominator of the probability expressed in lowest terms, simply find $n$ equal to the greatest common divisor of that numerator and denominator plus 2004. The L shape made by adjoining three congruent squares can be subdivided into four smaller L shapes. Each of these can in turn be subdivided, and so forth. If we perform $n$ successive subdivisions, how many of the $4^{n}$ L's left at the end will be in the same orientation as the original one?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to parse through multiple parts:\n\n## Part 1: Finding n\n\nThe problem mentions a probability problem about red and blue balls, then says \"Instead of computing 100 times the numerator plus the denominator... find n equal to the greatest common divisor of that numerator and denominator plus 2004.\"\n\nSince the problem states the probability is $\\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are **relatively prime** integers, we have $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$.\n\nTherefore: $n = \\gcd(a,b) + 2004 = 1 + 2004 = 2005$\n\n## Part 2: The L-Shape Subdivision Problem\n\nNow I need to solve: \"If we perform $n = 2005$ successive subdivisions, how many of the $4^n$ L's left at the end will be in the same orientation as the original one?\"\n\n### Understanding the Subdivision\n\nAn L-shape made of 3 congruent squares subdivides into 4 smaller L-shapes. The key question is: what are the orientations of these 4 smaller L's?\n\nAn L-shape has 4 possible orientations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270° rotations).\n\n### Setting up the Recurrence\n\nLet $a_n$ be the number of L-shapes in the original orientation after $n$ subdivisions.\nLet $b_n, c_n, d_n$ be the counts for the other three orientations.\n\nInitially: $a_0 = 1, b_0 = c_0 = d_0 = 0$\n\nBy the standard L-triomino subdivision pattern, when any L subdivides (regardless of its current orientation), it produces exactly one L in each of the four orientations.\n\nThis gives us:\n$$a_{n+1} = a_n + b_n + c_n + d_n = 4^n$$\n\n(since the total number of L's after $n$ subdivisions is $4^n$)\n\nSimilarly: $b_{n+1} = c_{n+1} = d_{n+1} = 4^n$\n\n### Solving the Recurrence\n\nStarting with $a_0 = 1$:\n- After 1 subdivision: $a_1 = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 = 4^0$\n- After 2 subdivisions: $a_2 = 4^1 = 4$\n- After 3 subdivisions: $a_3 = 4^2 = 16$\n\nIn general: $a_n = 4^{n-1}$ for $n \\geq 1$\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nFor $n = 2005$:\n$$a_{2005} = 4^{2004} = (2^2)^{2004} = 2^{4008}$$\n\nWe can verify: Total L's = $4^{2005}$, and by symmetry, each orientation has $4^{2004}$ L's, giving $4 \\times 4^{2004} = 4^{2005}$ ✓\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem first establishes n = 2005 by noting that for relatively prime a and b, gcd(a,b) = 1, so n = 1 + 2004 = 2005. For the L-shape subdivision, each L subdivides into 4 smaller L's with one in each orientation. This gives the recurrence a_{n+1} = 4^n, leading to a_n = 4^{n-1} for n ≥ 1. Therefore, a_{2005} = 4^{2004} = 2^{4008}.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4^2004\"\n}",
