  "math_problem": "$A B C D E$ is a cyclic convex pentagon, and $A C=B D=C E . A C$ and $B D$ intersect at $X$, and $B D$ and $C E$ intersect at $Y$. If $A X=6, X Y=4$, and $Y E=7$, then the area of pentagon $A B C D E$ can be written as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are integers, $c$ is positive, $b$ is square-free, and $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$. Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of determining the encoded numerical representation of the pentagon's area in radical form, simply find $k = CE - 8$, where $CE$ is the common length of the specified equal chords derived from the given segment lengths along the intersecting lines. Let $A B C D$ be a unit square. A circle with radius $\\frac{32}{49}$ passes through point $D$ and is tangent to side $A B$ at point $E$. Then $D E=\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=k$. Find $(k + 99) m+n$.",
