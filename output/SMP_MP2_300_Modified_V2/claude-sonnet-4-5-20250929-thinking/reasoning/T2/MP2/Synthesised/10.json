  "math_problem": "You are given a $10 \\times 2$ grid of unit squares. Two different squares are adjacent if they share a side. How many ways can one mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent? Instead of counting the total number of ways to mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent, simply find $w$, where $w$ is the number of ways to mark one square in each of nine consecutive rows such that no two marked squares in adjacent rows share the same column. Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are positive integers with $m<n$ such that the interval $[m, n)$ contains more multiples of $(w + 2019)$ than multiples of $(w + 1998)$. Compute the maximum possible value of $n-m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to find $w$ first, then solve the interval problem.\n\n## Finding $w$\n\nIn a $10 \\times 2$ grid, I need to mark one square in each of 9 consecutive rows such that no two marked squares in adjacent rows share the same column.\n\nWith only 2 columns, if I mark column 1 in row $i$, I must mark column 2 in row $i+1$, then column 1 in row $i+2$, and so on - the columns must alternate.\n\nFor the first of the 9 rows, I have 2 choices (column 1 or column 2). Once this is chosen, all subsequent rows are determined by the alternating pattern.\n\nTherefore, **$w = 2$**.\n\n## Solving the Interval Problem\n\nNow I need to find the maximum value of $n - m$ where $m < n$ are positive integers such that $[m, n)$ contains more multiples of $(w + 2019) = 2021$ than multiples of $(w + 1998) = 2000$.\n\nLet me denote:\n- $\\#_{2021}$ = number of multiples of 2021 in $[m, n)$\n- $\\#_{2000}$ = number of multiples of 2000 in $[m, n)$\n\nI want $\\#_{2021} > \\#_{2000}$ while maximizing $n - m$.\n\n**Key insight:** Since $2021 > 2000$, multiples of 2021 are sparser. For large intervals, we'd typically have fewer multiples of 2021 than 2000. To get more multiples of 2021, I need to carefully position the interval.\n\n**Strategy:** Start the interval just after a multiple of 2000 (to avoid counting it) and extend as far as possible.\n\nConsider the interval $[2001, 2000k)$ for integer $k \\geq 2$:\n\n- **Multiples of 2000:** These are $4000, 6000, \\ldots, 2000(k-1)$, giving $\\#_{2000} = k - 2$\n\n- **Multiples of 2021:** I need multiples in $[2001, 2000k)$. Since the first multiple is 2021, I have:\n  $$\\#_{2021} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2000k - 1}{2021} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\nFor $\\#_{2021} > \\#_{2000}$, I need:\n$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2000k - 1}{2021} \\right\\rfloor \\geq k - 1$$\n\nSince $\\frac{2000k - 1}{2021} = k - \\frac{21k + 1}{2021}$, I need:\n$$k - \\frac{21k + 1}{2021} \\geq k - 1$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{21k + 1}{2021} \\leq 1$$\n$$21k + 1 \\leq 2021$$\n$$k \\leq \\frac{2020}{21} \\approx 96.19$$\n\nSo $k \\leq 96$.\n\n**Checking $k = 96$:**\n- $\\#_{2000} = 96 - 2 = 94$\n- $\\#_{2021} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{191999}{2021} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 95.003 \\rfloor = 95$\n\nIndeed, $95 > 94$ ✓\n\n**Checking $k = 97$:**\n- $\\#_{2000} = 97 - 2 = 95$  \n- $\\#_{2021} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{193999}{2021} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 95.993 \\rfloor = 95$\n\nWe get $95 = 95$, which doesn't satisfy strict inequality ✗\n\nTherefore, the maximum is achieved at $k = 96$:\n$$n - m = 192000 - 2001 = 189999$$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found w = 2 by noting that marking squares in 9 consecutive rows of a 10×2 grid with no adjacent marked squares in the same column requires alternating columns, giving 2 choices. Then, with intervals containing more multiples of 2021 than 2000, I analyzed [2001, 2000k) and found that k ≤ 96 works, with k = 96 giving the maximum interval length of 192000 - 2001 = 189999.\",\n    \"answer\": \"189999\"\n}",
