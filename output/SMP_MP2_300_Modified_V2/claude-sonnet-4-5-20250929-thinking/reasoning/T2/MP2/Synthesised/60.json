  "math_problem": "After walking so much that his feet get really tired, the beaver staggers so that, at each step, his coordinates change by either (+1,+1) or (+1,-1). Now he walks from (0,0) to (8,0) without ever going below the x-axis. How many such paths are there? Instead of counting the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,0) that never go below the x-axis, simply find $k = m - 49$, where $m$ is the number of lattice paths from (0,-2) to (8,0) using steps of (+1,+1) or (+1,-1) derived from the reflection principle to count paths that violate the non-negativity condition. How many multiples of $k$ between $(k + 3)^{6}$ and $(k + 3)^{9}$ are perfect squares?",
