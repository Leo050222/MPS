  "math_problem": "If you roll four fair 6-sided dice, what is the probability that at least three of them will show the same value? Instead of computing the probability that at least three dice show the same value among four rolls, simply find $g = \\binom{4}{3} - 3$, where $\\binom{4}{3}$ is the number of ways to choose which three dice match in the exactly three matching case derived from the event decomposition. The classrooms at MIT are each identified with a positive integer (with no leading zeroes). One day, as President Reif walks down the Infinite Corridor, he notices that a digit zero on a room sign has fallen off. Let $N$ be the original number of the room, and let $M$ be the room number as shown on the sign. The smallest interval containing all possible values of $\\frac{M}{N}$ can be expressed as $\\left[\\frac{a}{b}, \\frac{c}{d}\\right)$ where $a, b, c, d$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=\\operatorname{gcd}(c, d)=g$. Compute $(g + 999) a+(g + 99) b+(g + 9) c+d$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to first find $g$, then solve the room number problem.\n\n## Finding g\n\n$g = \\binom{4}{3} - 3 = \\frac{4!}{3!1!} - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1$\n\n## The Room Number Problem\n\nLet me denote the room number $N$ which contains a digit '0' somewhere. When this '0' falls off, we get $M$.\n\nIf the '0' is positioned such that there are digits representing value $A$ to its left and digits representing value $B$ to its right (where $B$ occupies $m$ digit positions), then:\n- $N = A \\cdot 10^{m+1} + B$ (the $+1$ accounts for the '0' position)\n- $M = A \\cdot 10^m + B$ (after the '0' falls off)\n\nTherefore:\n$$\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{A \\cdot 10^m + B}{A \\cdot 10^{m+1} + B}$$\n\nLet me substitute $x = A \\cdot 10^m$ and $y = B$:\n$$\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{x + y}{10x + y}$$\n\nLet $t = \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{B}{A \\cdot 10^m}$. Then:\n$$\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{x(1 + t)}{x(10 + t)} = \\frac{1 + t}{10 + t}$$\n\n## Finding the Range of t\n\nConstraints:\n- $A \\geq 1$ (no leading zeroes in $N$)\n- $0 \\leq B < 10^m$ ($B$ represents $m$ digit positions)\n- $A, B, m$ are non-negative integers\n\nTherefore:\n- Minimum: $t = 0$ when $B = 0$ (e.g., $N = 10, 20, 100, ...$)\n- For fixed $m$, maximum occurs when $A = 1$ and $B = 10^m - 1$:\n  $$t_{\\max}(m) = \\frac{10^m - 1}{10^m} = 1 - \\frac{1}{10^m}$$\n\nAs $m \\to \\infty$, $t_{\\max} \\to 1^-$, but $t < 1$ always (since $B < 10^m$).\n\n## Finding the Interval for M/N\n\nSince $f(t) = \\frac{1 + t}{10 + t}$ is strictly increasing (as $f'(t) = \\frac{9}{(10+t)^2} > 0$), and $t \\in [0, 1)$:\n\n- Minimum: $f(0) = \\frac{1}{10}$ (achieved, e.g., $N=10, M=1$)\n- Supremum: $\\lim_{t \\to 1^-} f(t) = \\frac{2}{11}$ (not achieved, but approached)\n\nLet me verify: $\\frac{1+1}{10+1} = \\frac{2}{11}$ corresponds to $t=1$, which requires $B = A \\cdot 10^m$, impossible since $B < 10^m$ and $A \\geq 1$.\n\nExamples approaching the supremum:\n- $N = 109$: $\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{19}{109}$\n- $N = 1099$: $\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{199}{1099}$\n- As $N = 10\\underbrace{99...9}_{m \\text{ nines}}$, we approach $\\frac{2}{11}$\n\nTherefore, the smallest interval is $\\left[\\frac{1}{10}, \\frac{2}{11}\\right)$.\n\n## Computing the Final Answer\n\nFrom the interval $\\left[\\frac{a}{b}, \\frac{c}{d}\\right) = \\left[\\frac{1}{10}, \\frac{2}{11}\\right)$:\n- $a = 1, b = 10$ with $\\gcd(1,10) = 1 = g$ ✓\n- $c = 2, d = 11$ with $\\gcd(2,11) = 1 = g$ ✓\n\nThe answer is:\n$$(g + 999)a + (g + 99)b + (g + 9)c + d$$\n$$= (1 + 999)(1) + (1 + 99)(10) + (1 + 9)(2) + 11$$\n$$= 1000 + 1000 + 20 + 11$$\n$$= 2031$$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I calculated g = C(4,3) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1. For the room number problem, when a '0' digit falls off from N to give M, I showed that M/N = (1+t)/(10+t) where t = B/(A·10^m), with A being the digits before the 0, B the digits after, and m the number of positions after the 0. Since A ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ B < 10^m, we have t ∈ [0,1), giving M/N ∈ [1/10, 2/11). Thus a=1, b=10, c=2, d=11 with gcd(1,10)=gcd(2,11)=1=g. The final answer is (1+999)·1 + (1+99)·10 + (1+9)·2 + 11 = 1000 + 1000 + 20 + 11 = 2031.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2031\"\n}",
