  "math_problem": "Find all positive integers $n$ such that: \n\\[\n\\dfrac{n^3+3}{n^2+7}\n\\]\nis a positive integer. Instead of finding all positive integers making the given rational expression a positive integer, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the positive integer such that for each such positive integer, it equals the value of the expression plus $k$. Find all the values of $m$ for which the zeros of $(k + 1) x^{(k + 1)}-m x-8$ differ by $(m - k)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve it in two parts.\n\n## Part 1: Finding k\n\nFirst, I'll find all positive integers $n$ such that $\\frac{n^3+3}{n^2+7}$ is a positive integer.\n\nUsing polynomial division:\n$$\\frac{n^3+3}{n^2+7} = \\frac{n(n^2+7) + (3-7n)}{n^2+7} = n + \\frac{3-7n}{n^2+7}$$\n\nFor this to be an integer, $(n^2+7)$ must divide $(3-7n)$, or equivalently, $(n^2+7)$ must divide $(7n-3)$.\n\nTesting small values:\n- $n=1$: $7(1)-3=4$ and $1+7=8$. Since $8 \\nmid 4$, this doesn't work.\n- $n=2$: $7(2)-3=11$ and $4+7=11$. Since $11|11$, this works!\n  - $\\frac{8+3}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} = 1$\n- $n=3$: $7(3)-3=18$ and $9+7=16$. Since $16 \\nmid 18$, this doesn't work.\n- $n=4$: $7(4)-3=25$ and $16+7=23$. Since $23 \\nmid 25$, this doesn't work.\n- $n=5$: $7(5)-3=32$ and $25+7=32$. Since $32|32$, this works!\n  - $\\frac{125+3}{32} = \\frac{128}{32} = 4$\n\nFor $n > 5$: We have $n^2+7 > 7n-3$ when $n^2-7n+10 > 0$. The roots of $n^2-7n+10=0$ are $n=2$ and $n=5$, so for $n>5$, we have $n^2+7 > 7n-3$, making division impossible.\n\nSo the only solutions are:\n- $n=2$: expression value = 1, so $2 = 1 + k \\Rightarrow k=1$\n- $n=5$: expression value = 4, so $5 = 4 + k \\Rightarrow k=1$\n\nTherefore, **k = 1**.\n\n## Part 2: Finding m\n\nWith $k=1$, the polynomial becomes:\n$$(k+1)x^{k+1} - mx - 8 = 2x^2 - mx - 8$$\n\nLet the zeros be $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. By Vieta's formulas:\n- Sum: $\\alpha + \\beta = \\frac{m}{2}$\n- Product: $\\alpha\\beta = -4$\n\nThe condition states that the zeros differ by $(m-k) = m-1$.\n\nUsing the identity $(\\alpha-\\beta)^2 = (\\alpha+\\beta)^2 - 4\\alpha\\beta$:\n$$(m-1)^2 = \\left(\\frac{m}{2}\\right)^2 - 4(-4)$$\n$$m^2 - 2m + 1 = \\frac{m^2}{4} + 16$$\n$$4m^2 - 8m + 4 = m^2 + 64$$\n$$3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0$$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$$m = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 720}}{6} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{784}}{6} = \\frac{8 \\pm 28}{6}$$\n\nSo $m = 6$ or $m = -\\frac{10}{3}$.\n\n**Verification:**\n- For $m=6$: $2x^2-6x-8=0 \\Rightarrow (x-4)(x+1)=0$, roots are 4 and -1.\n  - $|4-(-1)| = 5 = |6-1| = 5$ ✓\n  \n- For $m=-\\frac{10}{3}$: $3x^2+5x-12=0$, roots are $\\frac{4}{3}$ and $-3$.\n  - $|\\frac{4}{3}-(-3)| = \\frac{13}{3} = |-\\frac{10}{3}-1| = \\frac{13}{3}$ ✓\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First found k=1 by determining that n=2 and n=5 are the only positive integers making the expression an integer, with n = (expression value) + 1 in both cases. Then solved for m using the condition that zeros of 2x² - mx - 8 differ by (m-1), leading to the quadratic equation 3m² - 8m - 60 = 0, which gives m = 6 or m = -10/3.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6, -10/3\"\n}",
