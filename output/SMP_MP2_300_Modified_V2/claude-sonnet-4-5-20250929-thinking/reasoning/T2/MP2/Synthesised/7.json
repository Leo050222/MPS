  "math_problem": "The fraction $\\frac{1}{2015}$ has a unique \"(restricted) partial fraction decomposition\" of the form $\\frac{1}{2015}=\\frac{a}{5}+\\frac{b}{13}+\\frac{c}{31}$ where $a, b, c$ are integers with $0 \\leq a<5$ and $0 \\leq b<13$. Find $a+b$. Instead of finding the sum of the coefficients corresponding to the two smallest denominators, simply find $L = b + 2004$, where $b$ is the integer coefficient of the term with denominator $13$ in the restricted partial fraction decomposition. Katherine has a piece of string that is $L$ millimeters long. She cuts the string at a location chosen uniformly at random, and takes the left half. She continues this process until the remaining string is less than one millimeter long. What is the expected number of cuts that she makes?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve two parts:\n\n## Part 1: Finding the Partial Fraction Decomposition\n\nFirst, I'll factor 2015:\n$$2015 = 5 \\times 403 = 5 \\times 13 \\times 31$$\n\nFor the equation $\\frac{1}{2015} = \\frac{a}{5} + \\frac{b}{13} + \\frac{c}{31}$, I'll multiply both sides by 2015:\n\n$$1 = 403a + 155b + 65c$$\n\n**Finding a (working modulo 5):**\n$$1 \\equiv 403a + 155b + 65c \\pmod{5}$$\n$$1 \\equiv 3a + 0 + 0 \\pmod{5}$$\n$$a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$$\n\nSince $0 \\leq a < 5$, we have $a = 2$.\n\n**Finding b (working modulo 13):**\n$$1 \\equiv 403a + 155b + 65c \\pmod{13}$$\n\nSince $403 = 31 \\times 13$ and $65 = 5 \\times 13$:\n$$1 \\equiv 0 + 155b + 0 \\pmod{13}$$\n$$155 = 11 \\times 13 + 12$$, so $155 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$\n$$1 \\equiv 12b \\pmod{13}$$\n\nTo find the inverse of 12 mod 13: $12 \\times 12 = 144 = 11 \\times 13 + 1$, so $12^{-1} \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$\n\nTherefore $b \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$, and since $0 \\leq b < 13$, we have $b = 12$.\n\n**Finding c:**\n$$1 = 403(2) + 155(12) + 65c$$\n$$1 = 806 + 1860 + 65c = 2666 + 65c$$\n$$c = -41$$\n\nSo $b = 12$.\n\n## Part 2: The String Cutting Problem\n\n$$L = b + 2004 = 12 + 2004 = 2016$$\n\nKatherine starts with a 2016 mm string. At each step, if the string has length $\\ell$, she cuts at position $U \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0, \\ell)$ and keeps the left piece.\n\nIf $X_i \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)$ represents the relative position of each cut, then after $n$ cuts:\n$$L_n = X_1 \\cdot X_2 \\cdots X_n \\cdot L_0$$\n\nTaking logarithms:\n$$\\ln L_n = \\ln X_1 + \\ln X_2 + \\cdots + \\ln X_n + \\ln L_0$$\n\nThe process stops when $L_n < 1$, which means:\n$$\\ln X_1 + \\ln X_2 + \\cdots + \\ln X_n < -\\ln L_0$$\n\nSince $X_i \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)$, we have $Y_i = -\\ln X_i \\sim \\text{Exponential}(1)$ with $E[Y_i] = 1$.\n\nThe number of cuts $N = \\min\\{n : Y_1 + Y_2 + \\cdots + Y_n > \\ln L_0\\}$ is a stopping time for a renewal process with exponential interarrival times.\n\nBy renewal theory, when $S_n = Y_1 + \\cdots + Y_n$ first crosses threshold $t = \\ln L_0$:\n- The expected overshoot is $E[Y_1] = 1$\n- So $E[S_N] = t + 1$\n- By Wald's equation: $E[S_N] = E[N] \\cdot E[Y_1] = E[N]$\n\nTherefore:\n$$E[N] = \\ln L_0 + 1 = \\ln 2016 + 1$$\n\nComputing numerically:\n$$\\ln 2016 \\approx 7.608526$$\n$$E[N] = 1 + \\ln 2016 \\approx 8.608526$$\n\nRounding appropriately: $E[N] \\approx 8.609$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found the partial fraction decomposition by solving 1 = 403a + 155b + 65c with modular arithmetic, getting a=2, b=12, c=-41. Then L = 12 + 2004 = 2016. For the string cutting problem, each cut at uniform position creates a sequence where the length after n cuts is the product of n uniform(0,1) variables times 2016. Taking logs transforms this to a sum of exponential(1) variables. The expected number of cuts until the string is less than 1mm is given by renewal theory as 1 + ln(2016), which equals approximately 8.609.\",\n    \"answer\": \"8.609\"\n}",
