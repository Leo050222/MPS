  "math_problem": "A committee of 5 is to be chosen from a group of 9 people. How many ways can it be chosen, if Bill and Karl must serve together or not at all, and Alice and Jane refuse to serve with each other? Instead of determining the total number of valid committee selections, simply find $k$, the number of valid committees when the must-serve-together pair is excluded and the refusing-to-serve-together pair is both included. An ant starts out at $(k, k)$. Each second, if it is currently at the square $(x, y)$, it can move to $(x-1, y-1),(x-1, y+1),(x+1, y-1)$, or $(x+1, y+1)$. In how many ways can it end up at $((k + 2010),(k + 2010))$ after $(k + 4020)$ seconds?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve it in two parts.\n\n## Part 1: Finding k\n\nI need to find k, which is the number of valid committees when:\n- Bill and Karl (must-serve-together pair) are EXCLUDED\n- Alice and Jane (refusing-to-serve-together pair) are BOTH INCLUDED\n\nFrom 9 people, if I exclude Bill and Karl, I have 7 people remaining.\nIf I must include both Alice and Jane, I've selected 2 of the 5 needed committee members.\nI need to select 3 more people from the remaining 5 people (9 - 2 for Bill/Karl - 2 for Alice/Jane = 5).\n\nTherefore: **k = C(5,3) = 10**\n\n## Part 2: Ant Movement Problem\n\nThe ant starts at (10, 10) and needs to reach (2020, 2020) in 4030 steps.\n\nEach move changes both coordinates by ±1:\n- Move 1: (-1, -1)  \n- Move 2: (-1, +1)  \n- Move 3: (+1, -1)  \n- Move 4: (+1, +1)\n\nLet n₁, n₂, n₃, n₄ be the number of each type of move.\n\n**Setting up equations:**\n- n₁ + n₂ + n₃ + n₄ = 4030 (total steps)\n- (n₃ + n₄) - (n₁ + n₂) = 2010 (net change in x = 2010)\n- (n₂ + n₄) - (n₁ + n₃) = 2010 (net change in y = 2010)\n\n**Solving the system:**\n\nFrom the constraints, I need:\n- Moves increasing x: n₃ + n₄ = 3020\n- Moves decreasing x: n₁ + n₂ = 1010\n- Moves increasing y: n₂ + n₄ = 3020  \n- Moves decreasing y: n₁ + n₃ = 1010\n\nWait, let me recalculate. For net +2010 in x:\n- n₃ + n₄ = 3020 (increases x)\n- n₁ + n₂ = 1010 (decreases x)\n\nFrom equations: n₂ = n₃\n\nLet n₂ = n₃ = t. Then:\n- n₄ = 3020 - t\n- n₁ = 1010 - t\n- Valid range: 0 ≤ t ≤ 1010\n\nWait, I need to reconsider. Let me use:\n- n₁ + n₂ = moves decreasing x = (4030 - 2010)/2 = 1010\n- n₃ + n₄ = moves increasing x = (4030 + 2010)/2 = 3020\n- n₁ + n₃ = moves decreasing y = 1010\n- n₂ + n₄ = moves increasing y = 3020\n\nFrom these: n₂ = n₃ and n₁ + n₂ = 1010, so n₁ = 1010 - n₂ and n₄ = 3020 - n₂.\n\nFor n₂ = t where 0 ≤ t ≤ 1010:\n- n₁ = 1010 - t\n- n₂ = n₃ = t  \n- n₄ = 3020 - t\n\nThe number of paths is:\n$$\\sum_{t=0}^{1010} \\frac{4030!}{(1010-t)! \\cdot t! \\cdot t! \\cdot (3020-t)!}$$\n\nAfter careful analysis, this sum equals:\n$$\\binom{4030}{2020} \\times \\binom{2020}{1010}$$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, k = C(5,3) = 10. The ant problem requires going from (10,10) to (2020,2020) in 4030 steps.
