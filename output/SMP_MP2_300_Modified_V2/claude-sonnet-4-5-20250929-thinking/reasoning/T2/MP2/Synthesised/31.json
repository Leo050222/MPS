  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be the answer to this problem. An urn contains white and black balls. There are $n$ white balls and at least two balls of each color in the urn. Two balls are randomly drawn from the urn without replacement. Find the probability, in percent, that the first ball drawn is white and the second is black. Instead of determining the percentage probability of drawing a white ball followed by a black ball without replacement, simply find $d = m - 74$, where $m$ is the total number of balls in the urn derived from the condition that this probability is an integer percentage. Find $x_{2012}$ given that $x_{n+1}=2x_{n}-x_{n-1}+d^{n}$ and $x_{1}=(d - 1)$, $x_{2}=d$.",
