  "math_problem": "The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to $k>0$, find $k$. Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition. A ladder is leaning against a house with its lower end $d$ feet from the house. When the lower end is pulled $(d - 6)$ feet farther from the house, the upper end slides $(d - 2)$ feet down. How long is the ladder (in feet)?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve it in two parts: first find the width of the rectangle to determine $d$, then use $d$ to solve the ladder problem.\n\n## Part 1: Finding the Rectangle Dimensions\n\nGiven:\n- Length $l = 3w$ (three times the width)\n- Perimeter = Area = $k > 0$\n\nFor the rectangle:\n- Perimeter = $2(l + w) = 2(3w + w) = 8w$\n- Area = $l \\times w = 3w \\times w = 3w^2$\n\nSetting perimeter equal to area:\n$$8w = 3w^2$$\n$$3w^2 - 8w = 0$$\n$$w(3w - 8) = 0$$\n\nSo $w = 0$ or $w = \\frac{8}{3}$\n\nSince we need positive dimensions, $w = \\frac{8}{3}$.\n\nVerification: Perimeter = $8 \\cdot \\frac{8}{3} = \\frac{64}{3}$ and Area = $3 \\cdot (\\frac{8}{3})^2 = \\frac{64}{3}$ ✓\n\n## Finding d\n\n$$d = w + \\frac{37}{3} = \\frac{8}{3} + \\frac{37}{3} = \\frac{45}{3} = 15$$\n\n## Part 2: The Ladder Problem\n\nGiven information:\n- Lower end is initially $d = 15$ feet from the house\n- Lower end is pulled $(d - 6) = 9$ feet farther away\n- Upper end slides $(d - 2) = 13$ feet down\n\nLet $L$ = length of ladder and $h$ = initial height on the wall.\n\n**Initial position (Pythagorean theorem):**\n$$L^2 = 15^2 + h^2 = 225 + h^2 \\quad \\text{...(1)}$$\n\n**Final position:**\n- New horizontal distance: $15 + 9 = 24$ feet\n- New height: $h - 13$\n\n$$L^2 = 24^2 + (h - 13)^2 = 576 + (h - 13)^2 \\quad \\text{...(2)}$$\n\nSince the ladder length is constant, equating (1) and (2):\n$$225 + h^2 = 576 + (h - 13)^2$$\n$$225 + h^2 = 576 + h^2 - 26h + 169$$\n$$225 = 745 - 26h$$\n$$26h = 520$$\n$$h = 20$$\n\nSubstituting back into equation (1):\n$$L^2 = 225 + 400 = 625$$\n$$L = 25$$\n\nVerification with equation (2): $L^2 = 576 + 7^2 = 625$ ✓\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found the width of the rectangle by setting perimeter equal to area: 8w = 3w², giving w = 8/3. Then d = w + 37/3 = 15. For the ladder problem, I used the Pythagorean theorem for both positions of the ladder. Initially: L² = 15² + h². After moving: L² = 24² + (h-13)². Setting these equal, I solved for h = 20, then found L² = 625, so L = 25 feet.\",\n    \"answer\": \"25\"\n}",
