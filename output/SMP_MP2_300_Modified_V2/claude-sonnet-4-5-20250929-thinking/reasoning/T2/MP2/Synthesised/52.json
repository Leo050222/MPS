  "math_problem": "Suppose that $x, y$, and $z$ are non-negative real numbers such that $x+y+z=1$. What is the maximum possible value of $x+y^{2}+z^{3}$ ? Instead of finding the maximum possible value of $x + y^2 + z^3$, simply find $k = z + 1/2$, where $z$ is the value of the variable with the cubic term in the non-negative real numbers $x, y, z$ satisfying $x + y + z = 1$ that achieve this maximum. Indecisive Andy starts out at the midpoint of the 1-unit-long segment $\\overline{H T}$. He flips $(k + 4019/2)$ coins. On each flip, if the coin is heads, he moves halfway towards endpoint $H$, and if the coin is tails, he moves halfway towards endpoint $T$. After his $(k + 4019/2)$ moves, what is the expected distance between Andy and the point on $\\overline{H T}$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve it in two parts.\n\n## Part 1: Finding k = z + 1/2\n\nI need to maximize $f(x, y, z) = x + y^2 + z^3$ subject to $x + y + z = 1$ and $x, y, z \\geq 0$.\n\nSince this is a constrained optimization problem on a simplex, I'll check:\n1. Interior critical points\n2. Boundary critical points  \n3. Corner points\n\nUsing $x = 1 - y - z$, I get $f(y,z) = 1 - y - z + y^2 + z^3$.\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n- $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -1 + 2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 1/2$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = -1 + 3z^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow z = 1/\\sqrt{3}$\n\nThis gives $x = 1 - 1/2 - 1/\\sqrt{3} < 0$, so this critical point is outside the feasible region.\n\nChecking the edges with second derivative tests, I find all critical points on edges are local minima.\n\nAt the three corners:\n- $(1, 0, 0)$: $f = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1$\n- $(0, 1, 0)$: $f = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1$  \n- $(0, 0, 1)$: $f = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1$\n\nAll corners give the maximum value of 1. Since we need the value of $z$ that achieves the maximum, and the problem involves making sense of the subsequent part, I'll use $(0, 0, 1)$ where $z = 1$.\n\nTherefore: $k = z + 1/2 = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2$\n\n## Part 2: Finding Andy's expected distance\n\nAndy flips $k + 4019/2 = 3/2 + 4019/2 = 2011$ coins.\n\nSetting up coordinates with $H$ at 0 and $T$ at 1, Andy starts at position $p_0 = 1/2$.\n\nAfter each flip:\n- If heads: $p_{n+1} = p_n/2$ (moves halfway to $H$)\n- If tails: $p_{n+1} = (p_n + 1)/2$ (moves halfway to $T$)\n\nLet $q_n = p_n - 1/2$ be the displacement from the midpoint. Then $q_0 = 0$.\n\nFor the next flip:\n- Heads: $q_{n+1} = q_n/2 - 1/4$\n- Tails: $q_{n+1} = q_n/2 + 1/4$\n\nThis gives $q_{n+1} = q_n/2 + \\epsilon_{n+1}$ where $\\epsilon_{n+1} \\in \\{-1/4, 1/4\\}$ with equal probability.\n\nComputing the variance:\n$$\\text{Var}(q_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (1/4)^{n-i} \\cdot \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{16} \\cdot \\frac{1-(1/4)^n}{3/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(1-(1/4)^n)$$\n\nFor $n = 2011$, $(1/4)^{2011} \\approx 0$, so $\\text{Var}(q_n) \\approx 1/12$.\n\nBy the Central Limit Theorem, for large $n$, $q_n$ is approximately normal with mean 0 and variance $1/12$.\n\nFor $X \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$, we have $E[|X|] = \\sigma\\sqrt{2/\\pi}$.\n\nWith $\\sigma = \\sqrt{1/12} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}$:\n\n$$E[|q_{2011}|] = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3\\pi}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6\\pi}}$$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found the maximum of $x + y^2 + z^3$ subject to $x+y+z=1$ and $x,y,z \\geq 0$. Checking all corners shows the maximum value is 1, achieved at all three corners. Using the corner $(0,0,1)$ gives $z=1$, so $k = z + 1/2 = 3/2$. Then Andy flips $k + 4019/2 = 2011$ coins. Setting up the random walk from the midpoint and computing the variance of displacement gives $\\text{Var}(q_n) \\approx 1/12$ for large $n$. Using the CLT approximation and the formula $E[|X|] = \\sigma\\sqrt{2/\\pi}$ for a normal random variable, the expected distance is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6\\pi}}$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/sqrt(6*pi)\"\n}",
