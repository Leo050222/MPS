  "math_problem": "Solve the system of equations $p+3q+r=3$, $p+2q+3r=3$, $p+q+r=2$ for the ordered triple $(p, q, r)$. Instead of determining the solution to the linear system, simply find $k = p + \\frac{311}{4}$, where $p$ is the first component of the ordered triple satisfying the system. I have written a strictly increasing sequence of six positive integers, such that each number (besides the first) is a multiple of the one before it, and the sum of all six numbers is $k$. What is the largest number in my sequence?",
