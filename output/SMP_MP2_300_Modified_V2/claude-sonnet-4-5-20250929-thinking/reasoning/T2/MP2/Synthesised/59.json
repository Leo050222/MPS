  "math_problem": "Compute the radius of the inscribed circle of a triangle with sides 15, 16, and 17. Instead of computing the inradius of the triangle, simply find $s$, the semi-perimeter of the triangle. What is the smallest positive integer $x$ for which $x^{2}+x+(s + 17)$ is not a prime?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem step by step:\n\n## Step 1: Find the semi-perimeter s\n\nThe triangle has sides 15, 16, and 17.\n\nThe semi-perimeter is:\n$$s = \\frac{15 + 16 + 17}{2} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24$$\n\n## Step 2: Set up the expression\n\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer $x$ for which $x^2 + x + (s + 17)$ is not prime.\n\nSubstituting $s = 24$:\n$$x^2 + x + (24 + 17) = x^2 + x + 41$$\n\n## Step 3: Test values of x\n\nThe polynomial $x^2 + x + 41$ is actually a famous prime-generating polynomial. Let me test values:\n\n- $x = 1$: $1 + 1 + 41 = 43$ (prime)\n- $x = 2$: $4 + 2 + 41 = 47$ (prime)\n- $x = 3$: $9 + 3 + 41 = 53$ (prime)\n- $x = 4$: $16 + 4 + 41 = 61$ (prime)\n\nI can continue checking, but there's a pattern. Notice that:\n$$x^2 + x + 41 = x(x+1) + 41$$\n\nWhen $x = 40$:\n$$40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(41) + 41 = 41(40 + 1) = 41 \\times 41 = 1681$$\n\nThis is clearly composite since $1681 = 41^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Verify this is the smallest\n\nThe polynomial $x^2 + x + 41$ is known to produce primes for all integers $x$ from 0 to 39, and first produces a composite number at $x = 40$.\n\nWe can verify: $1681 = 41^2$ is not prime.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $x$ for which $x^2 + x + 41$ is not prime is $\\boxed{40}$.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found the semi-perimeter s = (15 + 16 + 17)/2 = 24. Then I needed to find the smallest positive integer x such that x² + x + (s + 17) = x² + x + 41 is not prime. The polynomial x² + x + 41 can be written as x(x+1) + 41. When x = 40, this becomes 40(41) + 41 = 41(40 + 1) = 41 × 41 = 1681, which is composite. The polynomial x² + x + 41 is known to generate primes for x = 0, 1, 2, ..., 39, and first produces a composite at x = 40.\",\n    \"answer\": \"40\"\n}",
