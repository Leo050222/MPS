  "math_problem": "$a$ and $b$ are integers such that $a+\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{15+\\sqrt{216}}$. Compute $a / b$. Instead of computing the ratio of the integer coefficient to the radicand in the denested form of the nested radical, simply find $k = a + 3$, where $a$ is the integer coefficient in that denested form. Mark has a cursed $k$-sided die that never rolls the same number twice in a row, and all other outcomes are equally likely. Compute the expected number of rolls it takes for Mark to roll every number at least once.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve it in two parts.\n\n## Part 1: Finding k\n\nFirst, I'll denest the nested radical $\\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{216}}$.\n\nSimplifying $\\sqrt{216}$:\n- $216 = 36 \\times 6 = 6^2 \\times 6$\n- So $\\sqrt{216} = 6\\sqrt{6}$\n\nNow I need to denest $\\sqrt{15 + 6\\sqrt{6}}$.\n\nI'll assume $\\sqrt{15 + 6\\sqrt{6}} = \\sqrt{p} + \\sqrt{q}$ for integers $p$ and $q$.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n$$15 + 6\\sqrt{6} = p + q + 2\\sqrt{pq}$$\n\nThis gives me:\n- $p + q = 15$\n- $2\\sqrt{pq} = 6\\sqrt{6}$, so $pq = 54$\n\nThese are roots of $t^2 - 15t + 54 = 0$.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$$t = \\frac{15 \\pm \\sqrt{225-216}}{2} = \\frac{15 \\pm 3}{2}$$\n\nSo $p = 9$ and $q = 6$.\n\nTherefore: $\\sqrt{15 + 6\\sqrt{6}} = \\sqrt{9} + \\sqrt{6} = 3 + \\sqrt{6}$\n\nThis means $a = 3$ and $b = 6$.\n\nThus: $k = a + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6$\n\n## Part 2: Expected Number of Rolls\n\nMark has a 6-sided die that never rolls the same number twice in a row. I need to find the expected number of rolls to see all numbers at least once.\n\nLet $E_i$ = expected additional rolls needed after seeing $i$ distinct numbers.\n\nWhen we have seen $i$ distinct numbers, on the next roll:\n- We cannot roll the last number (1 option excluded)\n- Of the remaining $k-1 = 5$ equally likely outcomes:\n  - $k-i = 6-i$ are new numbers\n  - $i-1$ are previously seen numbers\n\nThe probability of getting a new number is $\\frac{6-i}{5}$.\n\nThis gives the recurrence:\n$$E_i = 1 + \\frac{6-i}{5} \\cdot E_{i+1} + \\frac{i-1}{5} \\cdot E_i$$\n\nSolving for $E_i$:\n$$E_i = \\frac{5}{6-i} + E_{i+1}$$\n\nWith $E_6 = 0$, I can work backwards:\n\n- $E_6 = 0$\n- $E_5 = \\frac{5}{1} + 0 = 5$\n- $E_4 = \\frac{5}{2} + 5 = \\frac{15}{2}$\n- $E_3 = \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{15}{2} = \\frac{10+45}{6} = \\frac{55}{6}$\n- $E_2 = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{55}{6} = \\frac{15+110}{12} = \\frac{125}{12}$\n- $E_1 = \\frac{5}{5} + \\frac{125}{12} = 1 + \\frac{125}{12} = \\frac{137}{12}$\n\nThe total expected number of rolls is:\n$$1 + E_1 = 1 + \\frac{137}{12} = \\frac{149}{12}$$\n\nThis can also be expressed as approximately 12.4167.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I denested the radical to find a=3 and b=6, giving k=6. Then I used a recurrence relation for the coupon collector problem with the constraint that consecutive rolls cannot be the same. The expected number of additional rolls after seeing i distinct numbers is E_i = 5/(6-i) + E_{i+1}. Working backwards from E_6=0, I calculated E_1=137/12.
