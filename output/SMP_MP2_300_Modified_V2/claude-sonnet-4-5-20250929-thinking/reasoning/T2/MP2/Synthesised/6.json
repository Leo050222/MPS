  "math_problem": "Ava and Tiffany participate in a knockout tournament consisting of a total of 32 players. In each of 5 rounds, the remaining players are paired uniformly at random. In each pair, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is knocked out of the tournament. The probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other during the tournament is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of evaluating the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator representing the probability that the two designated players meet during the tournament, simply find $b$, the denominator of that probability when expressed as a reduced fraction. Let $p$ be a real number and $c \\neq 0$ an integer such that $c-0.1<x^{p}\\left(\\frac{1-(1+x)^{(b-6)}}{1+(1+x)^{(b-6)}}\\right)<c+0.1$ for all (positive) real numbers $x$ with $(b-16)<x<10^{-100}$. Find the ordered pair $(p, c)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve it in two parts:\n\n## Part 1: Finding the denominator b\n\nFirst, I'll find the probability that Ava and Tiffany meet during a 32-player knockout tournament.\n\nLet $P_n$ denote the probability that two specific players meet in a tournament with $2^n$ players.\n\n**Setting up the recurrence:**\n- With probability $\\frac{1}{2^n-1}$, they're paired in round 1\n- With probability $\\frac{2^n-2}{2^n-1}$, they're not paired in round 1\n  - If not paired, each must win their match (probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ each)\n  - If both win (probability $\\frac{1}{4}$), they're in a $2^{n-1}$ player tournament\n\nThis gives: $P_n = \\frac{1}{2^n-1} + \\frac{2^n-2}{2^n-1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot P_{n-1}$\n\nSimplifying: $P_n = \\frac{1}{2^n-1} + \\frac{2^{n-1}-1}{2(2^n-1)} \\cdot P_{n-1}$\n\n**Computing the probabilities:**\n- $P_1 = 1$ (two players must meet)\n- $P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $P_3 = \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{3}{14} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{3}{28} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $P_4 = \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{7}{30} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{7}{120} = \\frac{1}{8}$\n- $P_5 = \\frac{1}{31} + \\frac{15}{62} \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{31} + \\frac{15}{496} = \\frac{16}{496} = \\frac{1}{16}$\n\nPattern: $P_n = \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$, so $P_5 = \\frac{1}{16}$\n\nTherefore, **b = 16**.\n\n## Part 2: Finding (p, c)\n\nWith $b = 16$, we have $b - 6 = 10$ and the constraint is for $0 < x < 10^{-100}$:\n\n$$c - 0.1 < x^p \\left(\\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}}\\right) < c + 0.1$$\n\n**Expanding for small x:**\n\nUsing the binomial theorem: $(1+x)^{10} = 1 + 10x + 45x^2 + ...$\n\nSo:\n- $1 - (1+x)^{10} = -10x - 45x^2 - ...$\n- $1 + (1+x)^{10} = 2 + 10x + 45x^2 + ...$\n\nTherefore:\n$$\\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}} = \\frac{-10x - 45x^2 - ...}{2 + 10x + 45x^2 + ...}$$\n\nFor small $x$:\n$$= \\frac{-10x}{2(1 + 5x + ...)} = -5x(1 - 5x + O(x^2)) = -5x + 25x^2 + O(x^3)$$\n\n**Determining p and c:**\n\nMultiplying by $x^p$:\n$$x^p \\cdot \\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}} \\approx x^p(-5x + 25x^2) = -5x^{p+1} + 25x^{p+2}$$\n\nFor this to be bounded as $x \\to 0^+$, we need $p + 1 = 0$, so $p = -1$.\n\nWith $p = -1$:\n$$x^{-1} \\cdot \\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}} = -5 + 25x + O(x^2)$$\n\nAs $x \\to 0^+$, this approaches $-5$. For $x \\in (0, 10^{-100})$, the expression stays in the range $[-5, -5 + 25 \\times 10^{-100}]$, which is well within $(-5.1, -4.9)$.\n\nTherefore, **(p, c) = (-1, -5)**.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found the probability that Ava and Tiffany meet in a 32-player tournament using a recurrence relation. The pattern P_n = 1/(2^(n-1)) gives P_5 = 1/16, so b = 16. For the second part, with b = 16, I analyzed the expression for small x > 0 using Taylor expansion. The expression (1-(1+x)^10)/(1+(1+x)^10) ≈ -5x + 25x^2 for small x. To make x^p times this expression bounded as x → 0, I need p = -1, which gives the limiting value c = -5. Verification shows this stays within the required interval (-5.1, -4.9) for 0 < x < 10^(-100).\",\n    \"answer\": \"(-1, -5)\"\n}",
