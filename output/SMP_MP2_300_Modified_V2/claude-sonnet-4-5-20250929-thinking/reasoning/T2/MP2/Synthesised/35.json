  "math_problem": "The following image is 1024 pixels by 1024 pixels, and each pixel is either black or white. The border defines the boundaries of the image, but is not part of the image. Let $a$ be the proportion of pixels that are black. Estimate $A=\\lfloor 10000 a\\rfloor$. An estimate of $E$ will earn $\\left\\lfloor 20 \\min \\left(\\frac{A}{E}, \\frac{E}{A}\\right)^{12}\\right\\rfloor$ points. Instead of estimating the floored scaled proportion of black pixels, simply find $k = N - 1048572$, where $N$ is the total number of pixels. The game of rock-scissors is played just like rock-paper-scissors, except that neither player is allowed to play paper. You play against a poorly-designed computer program that plays rock with $50 \\%$ probability and scissors with $50 \\%$ probability. If you play optimally against the computer, find the probability that after $(k + 4)$ games you have won at least $k$.",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem step by step:\n\n## Step 1: Find k\n\nFirst, I need to determine $k$:\n- The image is 1024 × 1024 pixels\n- Total number of pixels: $N = 1024 \\times 1024 = 1,048,576$\n- $k = N - 1,048,572 = 1,048,576 - 1,048,572 = 4$\n\n## Step 2: Understand the Rock-Scissors Game\n\nIn rock-scissors (rock-paper-scissors without paper):\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors loses to Rock\n- Matching moves result in a tie\n\nThe computer plays:\n- Rock: 50% probability\n- Scissors: 50% probability\n\n## Step 3: Determine Optimal Strategy\n\nIf I play **Rock** every time:\n- Win when computer plays Scissors: 50%\n- Tie when computer plays Rock: 50%\n- Lose: 0%\n\nIf I play **Scissors** every time:\n- Lose when computer plays Rock: 50%\n- Tie when computer plays Scissors: 50%\n- Win: 0%\n\n**Optimal strategy: Always play Rock**\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the Probability\n\nWith optimal play, each game results in:\n- Win with probability $p = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Tie with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNumber of games: $k + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8$\n\nLet $W$ = number of wins. I need $P(W \\geq 4)$.\n\n$W$ follows a binomial distribution with $n = 8$ and $p = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n$$P(W \\geq 4) = \\sum_{i=4}^{8} \\binom{8}{i} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^8$$\n\nCalculating binomial coefficients:\n- $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$\n- $\\binom{8}{5} = 56$\n- $\\binom{8}{6} = 28$\n- $\\binom{8}{7} = 8$\n- $\\binom{8}{8} = 1$\n\nSum: $70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 163$\n\n$$P(W \\geq 4) = \\frac{163}{256}$$\n\nSince 163 is prime and 256 = $2^8$, this fraction is already in lowest terms.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I calculated k = 1,048,576 - 1,048,572 = 4. In rock-scissors (without paper), rock beats scissors. The computer plays rock and scissors each with 50% probability. Playing rock optimally gives me a 50% win rate and 50% tie rate. After 8 games (k+4), the number of wins W follows Binomial(8, 0.5). P(W ≥ 4) = sum of C(8,i) for i=4 to 8, divided by 2^8 = (70+56+28+8+1)/256 = 163/256.\",\n    \"answer\": \"163/256\"\n}",
