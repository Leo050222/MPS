  "reasoning_content": "## Problem 1: Denesting the Radical\n\nLet me denest $\\sqrt{15+\\sqrt{216}}$.\n\nFirst, I'll simplify $\\sqrt{216}$:\n$$\\sqrt{216} = \\sqrt{36 \\times 6} = 6\\sqrt{6}$$\n\nSo I need to denest: $\\sqrt{15+6\\sqrt{6}}$\n\nI'll assume this can be written as $\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y}$ for some values $x$ and $y$.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n$$15+6\\sqrt{6} = x + y + 2\\sqrt{xy}$$\n\nComparing rational and irrational parts:\n- Rational part: $x + y = 15$\n- Irrational part: $2\\sqrt{xy} = 6\\sqrt{6}$\n\nFrom the irrational part:\n$$\\sqrt{xy} = 3\\sqrt{6}$$\n$$xy = 54$$\n\nSo I need to solve the system:\n- $x + y = 15$\n- $xy = 54$\n\nThese are roots of the quadratic: $t^2 - 15t + 54 = 0$\n\n$$t = \\frac{15 \\pm \\sqrt{225 - 216}}{2} = \\frac{15 \\pm 3}{2}$$\n\nTherefore $t = 9$ or $t = 6$, so $x = 9$ and $y = 6$.\n\nThus: $\\sqrt{15+6\\sqrt{6}} = \\sqrt{9} + \\sqrt{6} = 3 + \\sqrt{6}$\n\nThis means $a = 3$ and $b = 6$.\n\nThe problem asks for $k = a + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6$.\n\n## Problem 2: Cursed Die Expected Rolls\n\nLet $E_k$ be the expected number of additional rolls needed when we have already seen $k$ distinct numbers.\n\nWhen we've seen $k$ numbers and just rolled one, the next roll has 5 equally likely outcomes (can't repeat):\n- $(6-k)$ of these are new numbers → transition to state $k+1$\n- $(k-1)$ of these are old numbers → stay in state $k$\n\nThis gives us the recurrence:\n$$E_k = 1 + \\frac{6-k}{5}E_{k+1} + \\frac{k-1}{5}E_k$$\n\nSolving for $E_k$:\n$$E_k\\left(1 - \\frac{k-1}{5}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{6-k}{5}E_{k+1}$$\n$$E_k \\cdot \\frac{6-k}{5} = 1 + \\frac{6-k}{5}E_{k+1}$$\n$$E_k = \\frac{5}{6-k} + E_{k+1}$$\n\nWith boundary condition $E_6 = 0$, working backwards:\n\n- $E_6 = 0$\n- $E_5 = \\frac{5}{1} + 0 = 5$\n- $E_4 = \\frac{5}{2} + 5 = \\frac{15}{2}$\n- $E_3 = \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{15}{2} = \\frac{10+45}{6} = \\frac{55}{6}$\n- $E_2 = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{55}{6} = \\frac{15+110}{12} = \\frac{125}{12}$\n- $E_1 = \\frac{5}{5} + \\frac{125}{12} = 1 + \\frac{125}{12} = \\frac{137}{12}$\n\nThe total expected number of rolls is:\n$$\\text{Total} = 1 + E_1 = 1 + \\frac{137}{12} = \\frac{149}{12}$$\n\n(The first roll gives us 1 number, then we need $E_1$ additional rolls.)\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I denested the radical by finding x and y such that sqrt(15+6√6) = √x + √y, yielding a=3 and b=6, so k=a+3=6.
