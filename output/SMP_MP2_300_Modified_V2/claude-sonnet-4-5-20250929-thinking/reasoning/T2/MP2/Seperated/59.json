Let me note that when x = 40:\n$$x^2 + x + 41 = 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 1600 + 40 + 41 = 1681$$\n\nLet me check if 1681 is prime:\n$$1681 = 41 \\times 41 = 41^2$$\n\nSo 1681 is not prime!\n\nTo verify this is the smallest such x, I should check if there's a pattern. The expression $x^2 + x + 41$ can be divisible by 41 when:\n$$x^2 + x + 41 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{41}$$\n$$x^2 + x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{41}$$\n$$x(x + 1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{41}$$\n\nThis means either $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{41}$ or $x \\equiv -1 \\equiv 40 \\pmod{41}$.\n\nThe smallest positive integers satisfying these conditions are x = 40 and x = 41.\n\nFor x = 40: $40^2 + 40 + 41 = 1681 = 41^2$ (not prime)\n\nThe famous Euler polynomial $x^2 + x + 41$ produces primes for all integers from x = 0 to x = 39, but fails at x = 40.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: The semi-perimeter s = (15+16+17)/2 = 24, so e = s + 17 = 24 + 17 = 41. For Problem 2: Testing x² + x + 41, we find that x = 40 gives 40² + 40 + 41 = 1681 = 41², which is not prime. This is the smallest positive integer for which the expression is composite, as the Euler polynomial x² + x + 41 is known to produce primes for x = 0 through x = 39.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"41\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"40\"\n}",
