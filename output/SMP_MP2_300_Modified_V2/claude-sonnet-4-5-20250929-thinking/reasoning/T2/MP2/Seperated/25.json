Let $p$ be the probability that no row has all its coins showing heads and no column has all its coins showing tails. If $p=\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator of the desired probability in lowest terms, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the sum of the probability that a specific row does not have all heads and the probability that a specific row has all heads."
