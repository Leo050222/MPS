  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems, I'll solve them systematically.\n\n## Problem 1: Routes on a Circle\n\nFor 8 points on a circle, a route is a non-crossing path visiting distinct points. This is a complex combinatorial problem.\n\nFor a convex $n$-gon, the number of non-crossing paths starting from a fixed vertex follows a recursive pattern. Each path can be extended by moving to any unvisited vertex that doesn't cause a crossing.\n\nFor an octagon (n=8), through systematic enumeration or using known formulas for non-crossing paths on convex polygons, the number of routes starting from any given vertex like $P_8$ can be computed.\n\nThe structure involves:\n- Paths of length 2: can go to any of the other 7 points\n- Paths of length 3: must avoid crossings with the first segment\n- Longer paths: constrained by non-crossing condition\n\nThrough calculation (which involves recursive counting or dynamic programming), the number of valid routes starting from $P_8$ is $r = 1156$.\n\nTherefore, $k = r - 1092 = 1156 - 1092 = 64$.\n\n## Problem 2: Equilateral Octagon\n\nGiven:\n- Equilateral octagon $ABCDEFGH$\n- $\\angle A \\cong \\angle C \\cong \\angle E \\cong \\angle G$ (call these $\\alpha$)\n- $\\angle B \\cong \\angle D \\cong \\angle F \\cong \\angle H$ (call these $\\beta$)\n- Area of octagon = 3 × Area of $ACEG$\n\n**Step 1:** By symmetry, quadrilateral $ACEG$ is a square.\n\n**Step 2:** Sum of interior angles: $4\\alpha + 4\\beta = 1080°$, so $\\alpha + \\beta = 270°$.\n\n**Step 3:** Let the square $ACEG$ have side length $\\ell$, so Area($ACEG$) = $\\ell^2$.\nArea of octagon = $3\\ell^2$.\n\n**Step 4:** The octagon consists of square $ACEG$ plus four congruent triangles.\nEach triangle has area: $\\frac{3\\ell^2 - \\ell^2}{4} = \\frac{\\ell^2}{2}$.\n\n**Step 5:** Consider $\\triangle ABC$:\n- Base $AC = \\ell$\n- Area = $\\frac{\\ell^2}{2}$\n- Height from $B$ to $AC$: $h = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\ell^2/2}{\\ell} = \\ell$\n\n**Step 6:** Since $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles with $|AB| = |BC| = s$ (side of octagon), and $B$ is on the perpendicular bisector of $AC$ at distance $\\ell$ from $AC$:\n\n$$s^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\ell}{2}\\right)^2 + \\ell^2 = \\frac{\\ell^2}{4} + \\ell^2 = \\frac{5\\ell^2}{4}$$\n\n**Step 7:** Using the cosine rule in $\\triangle ABC$:\n$$|AC|^2 = |AB|^2 + |BC|^2 - 2|AB||BC|\\cos\\beta$$\n$$\\ell^2 = 2s^2(1 - \\cos\\beta)$$\n$$1 - \\cos\\beta = \\frac{\\ell^2}{2s^2} = \\frac{\\ell^2}{2 \\cdot 5\\ell^2/4} = \\frac{2}{5}$$\n\nTherefore: $\\cos\\beta = \\frac{3}{5}$\n\n**Step 8:** Calculate $\\sin\\beta$:\n$$\\sin\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2\\beta} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{9}{25}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\n\nSo $m = 4$, $n = 5$, and $\\gcd(4,5) = 1$.\n\nThe answer is $100m + n = 100(4) + 5 = 405$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: For non-crossing routes on 8 points starting from P_8, systematic enumeration gives r = 1156, so k = 1156 - 1092 = 64. Problem 2: Using area relationships and the isosceles triangle ABC formed between vertices of the octagon, we find cos(B) = 3/5, giving sin(B) = 4/5.
