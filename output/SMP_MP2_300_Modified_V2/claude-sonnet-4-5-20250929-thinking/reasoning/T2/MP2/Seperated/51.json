I need to find the perimeter of the square.\n\nWhen a square is inscribed in a circle, its vertices lie on the circle, and the diagonal of the square equals the diameter of the circle.\n\nGiven:\n- Circle radius = 1\n- Circle diameter = 2(1) = 2\n\nFor a square with side length $s$:\n- The diagonal has length $s\\sqrt{2}$ (by Pythagorean theorem)\n- Setting diagonal equal to diameter: $s\\sqrt{2} = 2$\n- Solving for $s$: $s = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\sqrt{2}$\n\nThe perimeter of the square is:\n$$P = 4s = 4\\sqrt{2}$$\n\nTo verify: if side length is $\\sqrt{2}$, then diagonal = $\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2$ ✓\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Found smallest prime factor of 40 is 2, counted primes ≤ 2 which is just {2}, so N(40) = 1, thus k = 1 + 0 = 1. For Problem 2: Square inscribed in circle of radius 1 has diagonal equal to diameter (2). Using s√2 = 2, found side length s = √2, so perimeter = 4√2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4√2\"\n}\n```",
