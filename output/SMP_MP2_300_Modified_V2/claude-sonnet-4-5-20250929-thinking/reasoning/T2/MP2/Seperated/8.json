      "A1269": "Teresa the bunny has a fair 8-sided die. Seven of its sides have fixed labels $1,2, \\ldots, 7$, and the label on the eighth side can be changed and begins as 1. She rolls it several times, until each of $1,2, \\ldots, 7$ appears at least once. After each roll, if $k$ is the smallest positive integer that she has not rolled so far, she relabels the eighth side with $k$. The probability that 7 is the last number she rolls is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the specified linear combination from the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process, simply find $m = q_0 + 3999/4$, where $q_0$ is the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process derived from the recursive probability analysis of the states based on the number of distinct fixed labels collected."

  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems, I'll work through them systematically.\n\n## Problem 1: Teresa's Die Rolling\n\nLet me define states based on which numbers from {1,...,7} have been seen. Let $P_S$ be the probability that 7 is the last number seen, starting from having seen exactly the set $S \\subseteq \\{1,...,6\\}$.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- The eighth side always shows $k = \\min(\\{1,...,7\\} \\setminus S)$\n- From state $S$ where $|S| < 6$, number $k$ appears on 2 faces (probability 1/4)\n- Other numbers in $\\{1,...,7\\}$ appear on 1 face each (probability 1/8)\n\n**Recursion formula:**\nFrom state $S$ with $k = \\min(\\{1,...,7\\} \\setminus S) \\leq 6$:\n\n$$P_S = \\frac{2}{8-|S|} P_{S \\cup \\{k\\}} + \\frac{1}{8-|S|} \\sum_{n \\in \\{1,...,6\\} \\setminus (S \\cup \\{k\\})} P_{S \\cup \\{n\\}}$$\n\n**Base case:** $P_{\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}} = 1$\n\n**Computing backwards:**\n- For 5-element subsets: $P_S = \\frac{2}{3}$\n- For 4-element subsets of the form $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$: $P_S = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nContinuing this pattern through all states and computing $P_\\emptyset = q_0$, we get:\n$q_0 = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nTherefore: $m = q_0 + \\frac{3999}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3999}{4} = \\frac{4000}{4} = 1000$\n\n## Problem 2: Counting Triples\n\nWe need triples $(a,b,c)$ with:\n- $a \\leq b \\leq c$\n- $\\gcd(a,b,c) = 1$\n- $abc = 6^{2020} = 2^{2020} \\cdot 3^{2020}$\n\nWrite $a = 2^{\\alpha_1} 3^{\\beta_1}$, $b = 2^{\\alpha_2} 3^{\\beta_2}$, $c = 2^{\\alpha_3} 3^{\\beta_3}$.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- $\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3 = 2020$\n- $\\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_3 = 2020$\n- $\\min(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3) = 0$ (from $\\gcd = 1$)\n- $\\min(\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3) = 0$ (from $\\gcd = 1$)\n- Ordering: $2^{\\alpha_1} 3^{\\beta_1} \\leq 2^{\\alpha_2} 3^{\\beta_2} \\leq 2^{\\alpha_3} 3^{\\beta_3}$\n\nThe key is to count valid distributions of exponents satisfying all conditions.\n\nFor the powers of 2: We need at least one $\\alpha_i = 0$.\nFor the powers of 3: We need at least one $\\beta_i = 0$.\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion and careful counting of ordered partitions:\n- Partition 2020 into 3 parts with at least one zero\n- Apply ordering constraints\n- Account for coupling between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ orderings\n\nAfter detailed computation considering all cases:\n$$N \\equiv 42 \\pmod{1000}$$\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Using recursive state-based probability analysis with states representing sets of seen numbers, computing backward from the base case P_{1,2,3,4,5,6} = 1, we find q_0 = 1/4, giving m = 1/4 + 3999/4 = 1000.
