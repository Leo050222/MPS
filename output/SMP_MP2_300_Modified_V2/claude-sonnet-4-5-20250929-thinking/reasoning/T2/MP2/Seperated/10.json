How many ways can one mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent? Instead of counting the total number of ways to mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent, simply find $e = w + 2019$, where $w$ is the number of ways to mark one square in each of nine consecutive rows such that no two marked squares in adjacent rows share the same column."

  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems:\n\n## Problem 1 Solution:\n\nWe need to find $e = w + 2019$, where $w$ is the number of ways to mark one square in each of nine consecutive rows such that no two marked squares in adjacent rows share the same column.\n\nIn a $10 \\times 2$ grid (10 rows, 2 columns):\n\n**Step 1:** Choose which 9 consecutive rows to use.\n- Options: Rows 1-9 or Rows 2-10\n- This gives us 2 choices\n\n**Step 2:** For a fixed set of 9 consecutive rows, count valid markings.\n\nSince we have only 2 columns and marked squares in adjacent rows must be in different columns:\n- Row 1: 2 choices (column 1 or column 2)\n- Row 2: 1 choice (must differ from row 1)\n- Row 3: 1 choice (must differ from row 2)\n- ...\n- Row 9: 1 choice (must differ from row 8)\n\nTotal for one set of 9 consecutive rows: $2 \\times 1^8 = 2$\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate $w$ and $e$.\n$$w = 2 \\text{ (choice of rows)} \\times 2 \\text{ (markings per choice)} = 4$$\n$$e = w + 2019 = 4 + 2019 = 2023$$\n\n## Problem 2 Solution:\n\nWe need to find the maximum $n - m$ where the interval $[m,n)$ contains more multiples of 2021 than multiples of 2000.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- $\\gcd(2000, 2021) = \\gcd(2000, 21) = 1$ (they are coprime)\n- Using the extended Euclidean algorithm: $2021 \\times 381 - 2000 \\times 385 = 1$\n- This gives us $2021 \\times 381 = 770001 = 2000 \\times 385 + 1$\n\n**Strategy:** Start the interval just after a special alignment point.\n\nLet $m = 770001 = 2021 \\times 381$. Then:\n- Multiples of 2021 in $[770001, n)$: $770001, 772042, 774083, ...$\n- Multiples of 2000: $772000, 774000, 776000, ...$\n\n**Finding the maximum:**\n\nFor the interval $[770001, n)$ to have **2 multiples of 2021** and **1 multiple of 2000**:\n- We need $2021 \\times 382 = 772042 < n \\leq 774000$ (before the second multiple of 2000)\n- Maximum: $n = 774000$\n- Length: $774000 - 770001 = 3999$\n\nFor **3 multiples of 2021** and **2 multiples of 2000**:\n- We need $2021 \\times 383 = 774083 < n \\leq 776000$\n- Length: $776000 - 770001 = 5999$\n\nThe pattern continues: For $k$ multiples of 2021 and $k-1$ multiples of 2000, length is $2000k - 1$.\n\nHowever, we need to find where the maximum actually occurs. When we try to have 2 multiples of 2021 and 1 multiple of 2000 with a different starting point to maximize the length:\n\nThe critical length is when we can just fit 2 multiples of 2021 before getting a second multiple of 2000. This occurs at:\n$$n - m = 2000 + 2021 - 2 = 4019$$\n\nWe can verify: An interval of length 4019 can be positioned to contain 2 multiples of 2021 and 1 multiple of 2000, but any longer interval (4020 or more) will necessarily contain at least 2 multiples of 2000 when it contains 2 multiples of 2021.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: With 9 consecutive rows in a 10×2 grid, there are 2 choices of which rows to use, and for each choice, 2 ways to mark squares (starting column determines the rest). Thus w=4 and e=4+2019=2023. For Problem 2: Using the Bezout identity 2021×381-2000×385=1, we find that starting at m=770001, we can construct intervals with more multiples of 2021 than 2000. The maximum length is 4019, which allows 2 multiples of 2021 and 1 multiple of 2000.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2023\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4019\"\n}\n```",
