  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems:\n\n## Problem 1\n\nThe problem states the image is 1024 × 1024 pixels. Let me calculate the total number of pixels:\n\n$N = 1024 \\times 1024 = 1,048,576$ pixels\n\nThe problem then asks us to find $k = N - 1,048,572$ (instead of estimating from an image that isn't provided).\n\nTherefore:\n$k = 1,048,576 - 1,048,572 = 4$\n\n## Problem 2\n\nIn the game of rock-scissors (rock-paper-scissors without paper), the rules are:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors loses to Rock\n- Rock ties with Rock\n- Scissors ties with Scissors\n\nThe computer plays:\n- Rock: 50% probability\n- Scissors: 50% probability\n\n**Optimal Strategy Analysis:**\n\nIf I play rock:\n- Win when computer plays scissors: 50%\n- Tie when computer plays rock: 50%\n- Expected value: 0.5 wins per game\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- Lose when computer plays rock: 50%\n- Tie when computer plays scissors: 50%\n- Expected value: 0 wins per game\n\nThe optimal strategy is to **always play rock**, giving me a 50% chance to win each game and 50% chance to tie (never lose).\n\n**Probability Calculation:**\n\nLet $X$ = number of wins in 8 games. Since I win with probability 0.5 each game:\n$X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(8, 0.5)$\n\nI need $P(X \\geq 4)$:\n\n$$P(X \\geq 4) = \\sum_{k=4}^{8} \\binom{8}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^8$$\n\nCalculating binomial coefficients:\n- $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$\n- $\\binom{8}{5} = 56$\n- $\\binom{8}{6} = 28$\n- $\\binom{8}{7} = 8$\n- $\\binom{8}{8} = 1$\n\nSum: $70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 163$\n\nTherefore:\n$$P(X \\geq 4) = \\frac{163}{256}$$\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Total pixels = 1024^2 = 1,048,576.

Probability of winning at least 4 out of 8 games follows Binomial(8, 0.5) distribution.
