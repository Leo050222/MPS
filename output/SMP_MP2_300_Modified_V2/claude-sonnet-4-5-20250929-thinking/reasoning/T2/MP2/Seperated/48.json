  "reasoning_content": "## Problem 1 Solution\n\nLet me analyze what a \"consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell\" means.\n\nA 2-configuration typically refers to a structure involving pairs of elements. \"Order 1\" suggests each element appears exactly once, and \"exactly 1 cell\" means all pairs are grouped together in a single cell.\n\nThis describes a perfect matching or pairing of all elements in set $A$. For such a configuration to exist, we need an even number of elements.\n\nThe problem states: \"simply find $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell.\"\n\nFor a set to be partitioned into pairs (forming a single cell), the minimum requirement is that $n$ must be even. The smallest positive even integer is $n = 2$.\n\nTherefore: $k = n + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7$\n\n## Problem 2 Solution\n\nFor exactly 7 games to be played in a best-of-9 series:\n- One team must win 5 games and the other 2 games\n- The winner must win the 7th game (otherwise the series would have ended earlier)\n- In the first 6 games, the eventual winner has exactly 4 wins\n\n**Case 1: Mathletes win 5-2**\n- In first 6 games: Mathletes win 4, lose 2\n- Game 7: Mathletes win\n- Probability: $\\binom{6}{4} \\cdot (2/3)^4 \\cdot (1/3)^2 \\cdot (2/3)$\n\n$$P_1 = \\binom{6}{4} \\cdot (2/3)^5 \\cdot (1/3)^2 = 15 \\cdot \\frac{32}{243} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} = 15 \\cdot \\frac{32}{2187} = \\frac{480}{2187}$$\n\n**Case 2: Opponent wins 5-2**\n- In first 6 games: Mathletes win 2, lose 4\n- Game 7: Opponent wins\n- Probability: $\\binom{6}{4} \\cdot (2/3)^2 \\cdot (1/3)^4 \\cdot (1/3)$\n\n$$P_2 = \\binom{6}{4} \\cdot (2/3)^2 \\cdot (1/3)^5 = 15 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{243} = 15 \\cdot \\frac{4}{2187} = \\frac{60}{2187}$$\n\n**Total Probability:**\n$$P = P_1 + P_2 = \\frac{480}{2187} + \\frac{60}{2187} = \\frac{540}{2187}$$\n\nTo simplify: $\\gcd(540, 2187) = 27$\n$$\\frac{540}{2187} = \\frac{540 \\div 27}{2187 \\div 27} = \\frac{20}{81}$$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell requires pairing all elements in a set, which means n must be even. The smallest such n is 2, giving k = n + 5 = 7. For Problem 2, exactly 7 games means one team wins 5-2, with the 7th game being decisive. This requires the winner to have exactly 4 wins in the first 6 games. Computing both cases (Mathletes win or lose) and summing gives probability 20/81.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"7\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"20/81\"\n}",
