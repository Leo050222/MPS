(3)\n\n**Step 1:** Subtract equation (3) from equation (1):\n$(p + 3q + r) - (p + q + r) = 3 - 2$\n$2q = 1$\n$q = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n**Step 2:** Subtract equation (3) from equation (2):\n$(p + 2q + 3r) - (p + q + r) = 3 - 2$\n$q + 2r = 1$\n\nSubstituting $q = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$\\frac{1}{2} + 2r = 1$\n$r = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n**Step 3:** Substitute into equation (3):\n$p + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 2$\n$p = 2 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{5}{4}$\n\n**Verification:**\n- Eq(1): $\\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{5+6+1}{4} = 3$ ✓\n- Eq(2): $\\frac{5}{4} + 1 + \\frac{3}{4} = 3$ ✓\n- Eq(3): $\\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 2$ ✓\n\n**Finding k:**\n$k = p + \\frac{311}{4} = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{311}{4} = \\frac{316}{4} = 79$\n\n## Problem 2: Finding the Maximum in the Sequence\n\nLet the sequence be $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Strictly increasing positive integers\n- Each term (except the first) is a multiple of the previous term\n- Sum = 79\n\n**Strategy:** To maximize $a_6$, minimize the sum of the first 5 terms.\n\nThe minimum sequence with all multipliers equal to 2 is:\n$1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32$ with sum $= 63$\n\nSince we need sum = 79, we need 16 more. We can increase the last multiplier:\n\n**Proposed sequence:** $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 48$\n\n**Verification:**\n- Each term is a multiple of the previous: $2=2(1)$, $4=2(2)$, $8=2(4)$, $16=2(8)$, $48=3(16)$ ✓\n- Strictly increasing ✓\n- Sum: $1+2+4+8+16+48=79$ ✓\n\n**Checking if we can do better:**\n\nIf we use multiplier $k$ for the last step:\n- $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + (1+k)a_5 = 79$\n- With minimum first 4 terms: $1+2+4+8+(1+k)a_5 = 79$\n\nFor $k=3$ (as above): $15+4(16)=79$ gives $a_6=48$\n\nFor $k=4$: We'd need $15+5a_5=79$, so $a_5=12.8$, but $a_5$ must be a multiple of 8 and $>8$, so $a_5≥16$ gives sum $≥95>79$. Not feasible.\n\nFor $k=2$: We'd get $a_6=32$ (less than 48).\n\nAny other arrangement with different early terms either violates the divisibility constraint or exceeds the sum of 79.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value is **48**.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I solved the system of linear equations by elimination to find p=5/4, then calculated k=p+311/4=79.
