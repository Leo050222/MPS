  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems, I'll solve them step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Partial Fraction Decomposition\n\nFirst, I need to factor 2015:\n$$2015 = 5 \\times 403 = 5 \\times 13 \\times 31$$\n\nSo I need to find:\n$$\\frac{1}{5 \\times 13 \\times 31} = \\frac{a}{5} + \\frac{b}{13} + \\frac{c}{31}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2015:\n$$1 = a(13)(31) + b(5)(31) + c(5)(13)$$\n$$1 = 403a + 155b + 65c$$\n\n**Finding a (working modulo 5):**\n$$1 \\equiv 403a + 155b + 65c \\pmod{5}$$\n$$1 \\equiv 3a + 0 + 0 \\pmod{5}$$\n\nSince $3 \\times 2 = 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, we get $a = 2$.\n\n**Finding b (working modulo 13):**\n$$1 \\equiv 403a + 155b + 65c \\pmod{13}$$\nNote that $403 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$, $155 = 12 \\times 13 - 1 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$, and $65 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$.\n$$1 \\equiv 12b \\pmod{13}$$\n\nSince $12 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$, we have $-b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$, so $b = 12$.\n\n**Finding c:**\nFrom $1 = 403(2) + 155(12) + 65c$:\n$$1 = 806 + 1860 + 65c$$\n$$65c = 1 - 2666 = -2665$$\n$$c = -41$$\n\nVerification: $806 + 1860 - 2665 = 1$ ✓\n\nTherefore: $L = b + 2004 = 12 + 2004 = 2016$\n\n## Problem 2: Expected Number of Cuts\n\nKatherine starts with a string of length 2016 mm. At each step, she cuts at a uniformly random location and keeps the left piece.\n\nLet $X_n$ be the length after $n$ cuts, with $X_0 = 2016$. If the current length is $\\ell$, she cuts at position $U \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0, \\ell)$ and keeps it.\n\nAfter $n$ cuts: $X_n = 2016 \\cdot U_1 \\cdot U_2 \\cdots U_n$ where $U_i \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)$ independently.\n\nShe stops when $X_n < 1$, which occurs when:\n$$\\prod_{i=1}^n U_i < \\frac{1}{2016}$$\n\nTaking logarithms:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln(U_i) < -\\ln(2016)$$\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n (-\\ln U_i) > \\ln(2016)$$\n\nLet $Y_i = -\\ln(U_i)$. Since $U_i \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)$, we have $Y_i \\sim \\text{Exponential}(1)$.\n\nThe number of cuts is:\n$$N = \\min\\left\\{n : \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i > \\ln(2016)\\right\\}$$\n\nThis is a classic result from renewal theory. For a Poisson process with rate 1, the number of arrivals needed for the total to exceed $t$ has expected value $t + 1$.\n\nMore precisely, if $S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$ and $N_t = \\max\\{n : S_n \\leq t\\}$ is the number of arrivals by time $t$, then for a Poisson process, $E[N_t] = t$.\n\nSince $N = N_t + 1$, we have:\n$$E[N] = \\ln(2016) + 1$$\n\nNumerically: $\\ln(2016) = \\ln(2^5 \\times 3^2 \\times 7) = 5\\ln(2) + 2\\ln(3) + \\ln(7) \\approx 7.609$\n\nTherefore: $E[N] \\approx 8.609$\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Factored 2015 = 5×13×31, then used modular arithmetic to find a=2, b=12, c=-41.
