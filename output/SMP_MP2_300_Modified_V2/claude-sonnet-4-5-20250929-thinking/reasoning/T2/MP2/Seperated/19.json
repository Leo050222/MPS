  "reasoning_content": "## Problem 1 Solution\n\nGiven: $ab = \\left(\\frac{\\text{lcm}(a,b)}{\\gcd(a,b)}\\right)^2$\n\nLet $d = \\gcd(a,b)$ and write $a = dm$, $b = dn$ where $\\gcd(m,n) = 1$.\n\nThen $\\text{lcm}(a,b) = dmn$.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n$$dm \\cdot dn = \\left(\\frac{dmn}{d}\\right)^2$$\n$$d^2mn = (mn)^2$$\n$$d^2 = mn$$\n\nSince $\\gcd(m,n) = 1$ and $mn = d^2$, both $m$ and $n$ must be perfect squares.\n\nLet $m = p^2$ and $n = q^2$ where $\\gcd(p,q) = 1$.\n\nThen $d = pq$, giving us:\n- $a = dm = pq \\cdot p^2 = p^3q$\n- $b = dn = pq \\cdot q^2 = pq^3$\n\nWe need $a, b \\leq 100$ and want to maximize $a + b = pq(p^2 + q^2)$.\n\nTesting values:\n\n**For $p = 2, q = 3$ (coprime):**\n- $a = 2^3 \\cdot 3 = 24$\n- $b = 2 \\cdot 3^3 = 54$\n- $a + b = 78$ ✓\n\n**For $p = 3, q = 2$:**\n- $a = 3^3 \\cdot 2 = 54$\n- $b = 3 \\cdot 2^3 = 24$\n- $a + b = 78$ ✓\n\n**For $p = 1, q = 4$:**\n- $a = 4, b = 64$\n- $a + b = 68$\n\n**For $p = 4, q = 1$:**\n- Same sum: 68\n\nHigher values of $p$ or $q$ violate the constraint $\\leq 100$.\n\n**Verification:** For $a = 24, b = 54$:\n- $\\gcd(24, 54) = 6$\n- $\\text{lcm}(24, 54) = 216$\n- $ab = 1296$\n- $\\left(\\frac{216}{6}\\right)^2 = 36^2 = 1296$ ✓\n\nSo $s = 78$, and $m = s - 77 = 1$.\n\n## Problem 2 Solution\n\nWe need to color squares such that no four red squares form an axis-parallel rectangle. This means no two rows can share the same pair of columns with red squares.\n\nLet $r_i$ be the number of red squares in row $i$. Row $i$ covers $\\binom{r_i}{2}$ column pairs.\n\nSince there are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ column pairs total, and each can appear in at most one row:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\binom{r_i}{2} \\leq 10$$\n\nFor $\\sum r_i = n$ red squares:\n$$\\sum \\binom{r_i}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sum r_i^2 - n\\right)$$\n\nBy Cauchy-Schwarz: $\\sum r_i^2 \\geq \\frac{n^2}{5}$\n\nFor $n = 13$: $\\sum r_i^2 \\geq 33.8$, so $\\sum r_i^2 \\geq 34$.\nThus $\\sum \\binom{r_i}{2} \\geq \\frac{34-13}{2} = 10.5$, meaning $\\geq 11 > 10$. Impossible.\n\nFor $n = 12$: We can try configuration $(3,3,2,2,2)$ which uses $3+3+1+1+1 = 9$ pairs.\n\n**Construction:**\n- Row 1: columns {1, 2, 3}\n- Row 2: columns {1, 4, 5}\n- Row 3: columns {2, 4}\n- Row 4: columns {2, 5}\n- Row 5: columns {3, 4}\n\nChecking all pairs: Each pair of rows shares at most 1 column. ✓\n\nThis gives us **12 red squares** with no rectangles.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Using the relation between gcd and lcm, I derived that a = p³q and b = pq³ where gcd(p,q)=1. Testing values with constraints a,b ≤ 100, the maximum sum is 78 (for p=2, q=3 giving a=24, b=54). Thus m = 78 - 77 = 1. Problem 2: The constraint that no four red squares form a rectangle means no two rows can share the same pair of columns. With 5 columns giving 10 possible column pairs, and each row with r_i red squares using C(r_i,2) pairs, we need Σ C(r_i,2) ≤ 10. For 12 red squares with distribution (3,3,2,2,2), we use exactly 9 pairs, which is achievable. For 13 squares, we'd need at least 11 pairs, which exceeds the limit. Therefore the maximum is 12.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
