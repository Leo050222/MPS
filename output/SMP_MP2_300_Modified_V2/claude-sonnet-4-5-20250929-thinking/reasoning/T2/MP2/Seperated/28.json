First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill 11. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?"

  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems, I'll solve them step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: System of Equations\n\nGiven system:\n- $xy + z = 40$ ... (1)\n- $xz + y = 51$ ... (2)  \n- $x + y + z = 19$ ... (3)\n\nFrom equation (1): $z = 40 - xy$\nFrom equation (2): $y = 51 - xz$\n\nSubstituting the first into the second:\n$$y = 51 - x(40 - xy) = 51 - 40x + x^2y$$\n$$y(1 - x^2) = 51 - 40x$$\n$$y = \\frac{51 - 40x}{1 - x^2}$$\n\nSimilarly:\n$$z = 40 - xy = 40 - x \\cdot \\frac{51 - 40x}{1 - x^2} = \\frac{40(1-x^2) - x(51-40x)}{1-x^2} = \\frac{40 - 51x}{1-x^2}$$\n\nSubstituting into equation (3):\n$$x + \\frac{51 - 40x}{1 - x^2} + \\frac{40 - 51x}{1 - x^2} = 19$$\n$$x + \\frac{91 - 91x}{1 - x^2} = 19$$\n$$x + \\frac{91(1-x)}{(1-x)(1+x)} = 19$$\n$$x + \\frac{91}{1+x} = 19$$\n\nMultiplying by $(1+x)$:\n$$x(1+x) + 91 = 19(1+x)$$\n$$x^2 + x + 91 = 19 + 19x$$\n$$x^2 - 18x + 72 = 0$$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$$x = \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{324-288}}{2} = \\frac{18 \\pm 6}{2}$$\n\nSo $x = 12$ or $x = 6$.\n\nFor $x = 12$: $y = 3$, $z = 4$, giving $(12, 3, 4)$ with $x+1 = 13$\n\nFor $x = 6$: \n$$y = \\frac{51-240}{-35} = \\frac{189}{35} = \\frac{27}{5}$$\n$$z = \\frac{40-306}{-35} = \\frac{266}{35} = \\frac{38}{5}$$\n\nThis gives $(6, \\frac{27}{5}, \\frac{38}{5})$ with $x+1 = 7$\n\nThe smaller root for $x+1$ is 7, corresponding to $z = \\frac{38}{5}$.\n\nTherefore:\n$$k = z + \\frac{17}{5} = \\frac{38}{5} + \\frac{17}{5} = \\frac{55}{5} = 11$$\n\n## Problem 2: Expected Number of Games\n\nThis tournament structure creates an interesting symmetry. In each round, exactly one player is eliminated, and there are 20 rounds total with 20 games.\n\n**Key Insight**: By symmetry, we can determine the probability that any two specific players face each other.\n\nThere are $\\binom{21}{2} = 210$ possible pairs of players. Since there are exactly 20 games played (one per round), and each game involves one unique pair, the expected number of pairs that play is 20.\n\nBy symmetry, each of the 210 pairs has an equal probability of playing against each other. Therefore:\n$$P(\\text{any specific pair plays}) = \\frac{20}{210} = \\frac{2}{21}$$\n\nThe expected number of games Alice plays equals the sum over all other players of the probability she plays against them:\n$$E[\\text{games Alice plays}] = \\sum_{i \\neq 11} P(\\text{Alice plays player } i) = 20 \\cdot \\frac{2}{21} = \\frac{40}{21}$$\n\nThis can also be verified by noting that the total expected number of \"player-game participations\" is $20 \\times 2 = 40$ (each game has 2 participants), and by symmetry each of the 21 players has the same expected participation: $\\frac{40}{21}$.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Solved the system to get quadratic x^2 - 18x + 72 = 0, with roots x=12 and x=6. The smaller value of x+1 is 7 (when x=6), giving z=38/5. Thus k = 38/5 + 17/5 = 11. For Problem 2: By symmetry, each pair of players has probability 2/21 of playing. Alice's expected games = 20 × (2/21) = 40/21.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"40/21\"\n}",
