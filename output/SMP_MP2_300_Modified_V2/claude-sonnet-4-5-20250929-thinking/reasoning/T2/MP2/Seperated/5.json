We need to find $k$, where:\n- The must-serve-together pair (Bill and Karl) is **excluded** (neither is on the committee)\n- The refusing-to-serve-together pair (Alice and Jane) is **both included** (both are on the committee)\n\nGiven:\n- Total people: 9\n- Committee size: 5\n- Bill and Karl: NOT on the committee\n- Alice and Jane: BOTH on the committee\n\nSince Alice and Jane are already on the committee (2 people), and Bill and Karl are excluded, we need to:\n- Choose 3 more people from the remaining 5 people (9 - Bill - Karl - Alice - Jane = 5 people)\n\nThe number of ways to do this is:\n$$k = \\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3! \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2 \\cdot 1} = 10$$\n\n## Problem 2 Solution\n\nThe ant starts at $(0,0)$ and can move to:\n- $(x-1, y-1)$: decrease both coordinates by 1\n- $(x-1, y+1)$: decrease $x$ by 1, increase $y$ by 1\n- $(x+1, y-1)$: increase $x$ by 1, decrease $y$ by 1\n- $(x+1, y+1)$: increase both coordinates by 1\n\nEach move independently changes:\n- The $x$-coordinate by $\\pm 1$\n- The $y$-coordinate by $\\pm 1$\n\n**For the x-coordinate:**\nTo reach $x = 2010$ from $x = 0$ in 4020 moves:\n- Let $R$ = number of moves that increase $x$ (go right)\n- Let $L$ = number of moves that decrease $x$ (go left)\n- We need: $R + L = 4020$ and $R - L = 2010$\n- Solving: $R = 3015$ and $L = 1005$\n\n**For the y-coordinate:**\nTo reach $y = 2010$ from $y = 0$ in 4020 moves:\n- Let $U$ = number of moves that increase $y$ (go up)\n- Let $D$ = number of moves that decrease $y$ (go down)\n- We need: $U + D = 4020$ and $U - D = 2010$\n- Solving: $U = 3015$ and $D = 1005$\n\n**Counting the paths:**\nSince the choice of direction for $x$ and the choice of direction for $y$ are independent for each move:\n- Ways to choose which 3015 moves increase $x$: $\\binom{4020}{3015}$\n- Ways to choose which 3015 moves increase $y$: $\\binom{4020}{3015}$\n- Total ways: $\\binom{4020}{3015}^2$\n\nSince $\\binom{4020}{3015} = \\binom{4020}{1005}$, we can also write this as:\n$$\\binom{4020}{1005}^2$$\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: We need committees where Bill and Karl are excluded and Alice and Jane are both included. With Alice and Jane already on the committee (2 people), we choose 3 more from the remaining 5 people, giving us C(5,3) = 10 ways. For Problem 2: Each move independently changes x by ±1 and y by ±1. To reach (2010, 2010) from (0,0) in 4020 steps, we need exactly 3015 moves increasing x and 3015 moves increasing y.
