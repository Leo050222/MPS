Let $p_{N}$ denote the probability that the product of these two integers has a units digit of 0. The maximum possible value of $p_{N}$ over all possible choices of $N$ can be written as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing one hundred times the numerator plus the denominator when the maximum possible value of $p_N$ is expressed as a reduced fraction, simply find $e = \\left(k + \\frac{1973}{100}\\right)$, where $k$ is the maximum possible value of $p_N$ derived from the upper bound analysis of the probability."

For integers from 1 to N, let:\n- $c_0$ = count with units digit 0\n- $c_5$ = count with units digit 5  \n- $c_e$ = count with even units digits {2,4,6,8}\n\nThe product has units digit 0 when:\n1. At least one number has units digit 0, OR\n2. One has units digit 5 and the other has an even units digit\n\nFor $N = 10q + r$ (where $0 \\leq r < 10$):\n- $c_0 = q$\n- $c_5 = q+1$ if $r \\geq 5$, else $q$\n- $c_e$ depends on how many of {2,4,6,8} are $\\leq r$\n\nCounting ordered pairs $(a,b)$ with product having units digit 0:\n- Pairs with first having units digit 0: $c_0 \\cdot N$\n- Pairs with second having units digit 0: $N \\cdot c_0$\n- Subtract double-count (both 0): $c_0^2$\n- Pairs with units digits 5 and even (neither 0): $2c_5 c_e$\n\nTotal: $2Nc_0 - c_0^2 + 2c_5c_e$\n\nProbability: $p_N = \\frac{2Nc_0 - c_0^2 + 2c_5c_e}{N^2}$\n\nFor $N = 10q$ (multiples of 10):\n- $c_0 = q$, $c_5 = q$, $c_e = 4q$\n\n$$p_{10q} = \\frac{2(10q)(q) - q^2 + 2(q)(4q)}{100q^2} = \\frac{20q^2 - q^2 + 8q^2}{100q^2} = \\frac{27q^2}{100q^2} = \\frac{27}{100}$$\n\nLet me verify this is maximum by checking other values:\n- $N=15$: $p_{15} = \\frac{53}{225} \\approx 0.236 < 0.27$\n- $N=25$: $p_{25} = \\frac{156}{625} = 0.2496 < 0.27$\n\nThe maximum value is $k = \\frac{27}{100} = 0.27$\n\nTherefore: $e = k + \\frac{1973}{100} = 0.27 + 19.73 = 20$\n\n## Problem 2\n\nFor $abc$ to be divisible by 20 = 4×5, we need divisibility by both 4 and 5.\n\n**Divisibility by 5:** At least one of {a,b,c} must equal 5 (the only multiple of 5 in {1,2,...,9}).\n\n**Divisibility by 4:** The product needs at least one factor of 4, or two factors of 2.\n\nLet me count by cases:\n\n**Case 1: Exactly one of {a,b,c} equals 5**\n\nNumber of such triplets: $\\binom{3}{1} \\cdot 8^2 = 192$\n\nFor position $(5,x,y)$ where $x,y \\in \\{1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9\\}$:\n- Product $5xy$ divisible by 4 ⟺ $xy$ divisible by 4\n- $xy$ divisible by 4 when:\n  - At least one of $x,y \\in \\{4,8\\}$, OR  \n  - Both $x,y$ are even\n\nCount pairs where $xy$ is NOT divisible by 4:\n- $x,y \\in \\{1,2,3,6,7,9\\}$ (avoiding {4,8}): 36 pairs\n- But exclude both in {2,6}: -4 pairs  \n- Total NOT divisible by 4: 32 pairs\n\nSo divisible by 4: $64 - 32 = 32$ pairs per position.\n\nTotal for Case 1: $3 \\times 32 = 96$\n\n**Case 2: Exactly two of {a,b,c} equal 5**\n\nNumber of such triplets: $\\binom{3}{2} \\cdot 8 = 24$\n\nFor $(5,5,x)$: product $25x$ divisible by 4 ⟺ $x \\in \\{4,8\\}$\n\nThat's 2 values per position.\n\nTotal for Case 2: $3 \\times 2 = 6$\n\n**Case 3: All three equal 5**\n\nProduct is 125, not divisible by 4.\n\nTotal for Case 3: $0$\n\n**Total:** $96 + 6 + 0 = 102$\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I found that the maximum probability occurs when N is a multiple of 10, giving p_N = 27/100.
