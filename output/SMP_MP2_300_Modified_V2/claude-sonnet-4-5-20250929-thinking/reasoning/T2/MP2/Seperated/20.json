      "A2098": "Wendy eats sushi for lunch. She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, but sushi is sticky, and Wendy can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi, assuming that the pieces of sushi are distinguishable? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row."

  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these two problems, I'll solve them step by step.\n\n## Problem 1:\n\nLet me label the 2×3 grid:\n```\nA B C\nD E F\n```\n\nThe problem asks for the degree of piece F in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces **after eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row**.\n\nThe two endpoint pieces of the top row are **A and C**.\n\nAfter eating A and C, the remaining pieces are: **B, D, E, F**\n\nNow I need to determine the adjacencies in the induced subgraph on {B, D, E, F}:\n- **B**: was originally adjacent to A, C, and E. After removing A and C, B is only adjacent to **E**\n- **D**: was originally adjacent to A and E. After removing A, D is only adjacent to **E**  \n- **E**: was originally adjacent to B, D, and F. All remain, so E is adjacent to **B, D, and F**\n- **F**: was originally adjacent to C and E. After removing C, F is only adjacent to **E**\n\nTherefore, in the induced subgraph on {B, D, E, F}:\n- deg(F) = 1 (F is only adjacent to E)\n\nSo k = deg(F) + 0 = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\n## Problem 2:\n\nFor $a, b \\in [0,1]$ and the fixed length 1 to form a triangle, we need the triangle inequality:\n- $a + b > 1$ ✓ (this is the binding constraint)\n- $a + 1 > b$ (always true since $a ≥ 0, b ≤ 1$)\n- $b + 1 > a$ (always true since $b ≥ 0, a ≤ 1$)\n\nFor the triangle to be **obtuse**, by the law of cosines, we need one angle to be greater than 90°. This happens when the square of one side exceeds the sum of squares of the other two.\n\nTesting the three cases:\n1. Angle opposite to $a$ obtuse: $a^2 > b^2 + 1$ → requires $a > 1$, impossible\n2. Angle opposite to $b$ obtuse: $b^2 > a^2 + 1$ → requires $b > 1$, impossible  \n3. Angle opposite to 1 obtuse: $1 > a^2 + b^2$ → **$a^2 + b^2 < 1$**\n\nSo we need both:\n- $a + b > 1$ (triangle inequality)\n- $a^2 + b^2 < 1$ (obtuse condition)\n\nTo find the probability, I calculate the area of this region in the unit square.\n\nFor fixed $a \\in [0,1]$:\n- Need $b > 1 - a$ and $b < \\sqrt{1-a^2}$\n- This is valid when $1 - a < \\sqrt{1-a^2}$, which holds for $0 < a < 1$\n\nThe area is:\n$$\\int_0^1 \\left(\\sqrt{1-a^2} - (1-a)\\right) da$$\n\nComputing each part:\n$$\\int_0^1 \\sqrt{1-a^2}\\, da = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$$ (quarter circle)\n\n$$\\int_0^1 (1-a)\\, da = \\left[a - \\frac{a^2}{2}\\right]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nTherefore, the area = $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\pi - 2}{4}$\n\nSince the sample space has area 1, the probability is $\\frac{\\pi - 2}{4}$.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: After eating endpoint pieces A and C from the top row, the remaining pieces are B, D, E, F. In the induced subgraph, F is only adjacent to E, so deg(F) = 1, giving k = 1. Problem 2: For a, b, 1 to form an obtuse triangle, we need a + b > 1 (triangle inequality) and a² + b² < 1 (obtuse condition). The probability is the area of this region, which equals π/4 - 1/2 = (π-2)/4.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(π-2)/4\"\n}",
