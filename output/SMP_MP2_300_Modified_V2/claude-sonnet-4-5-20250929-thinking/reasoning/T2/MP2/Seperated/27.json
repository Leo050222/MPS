(2)\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2):\n$(x + y^2 - z) - (x^2 + y - z) = 124 - 100$\n\n$x + y^2 - x^2 - y = 24$\n\n$y^2 - y - x^2 + x = 24$\n\n$y(y-1) - x(x-1) = 24$\n\nFactoring:\n$(y^2 - x^2) - (y - x) = 24$\n\n$(y-x)(y+x) - (y-x) = 24$\n\n$(y-x)(y+x-1) = 24$\n\nLet $a = y - x$ and $b = y + x - 1$. Then $ab = 24$.\n\nFrom these equations:\n- $y = \\frac{a + b + 1}{2}$\n- $x = \\frac{b + 1 - a}{2}$\n\nFor $x$ and $y$ to be integers, we need $a$ and $b$ to have opposite parity.\n\nFactor pairs of 24 with opposite parity:\n- $(1, 24)$: $y = \\frac{26}{2} = 13$, $x = \\frac{24}{2} = 12$ ✓\n- $(3, 8)$: $y = \\frac{12}{2} = 6$, $x = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$ ✓\n- $(8, 3)$: $y = 6$, $x = -2$ (negative, invalid)\n- $(24, 1)$: $y = 13$, $x = -11$ (negative, invalid)\n\nValid pairs with $y > x$:\n- $(x, y) = (12, 13)$ with $y = 13$\n- $(x, y) = (3, 6)$ with $y = 6$\n\nThe smaller value of $y$ among these pairs is $y = 6$.\n\nTherefore, $k = y + 18 = 6 + 18 = 24$.\n\n## Problem 2 Solution\n\nFrom Problem 1, we have $n = 24$ (interpreting \"the answer to this problem\" as Problem 1's answer being used).\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of colors for divisors of $(n-24)! = (24-24)! = 0! = 1$.\n\nThe only divisor of 1 is 1 itself.\n\nFor a divisor poset, the minimum number of colors needed such that no two divisors of the same color satisfy $s \\mid t$ equals the length of the longest chain in the poset.\n\nFor the number $m$, this equals $1 + \\Omega(m)$, where $\\Omega(m)$ is the number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nFor $1$: $\\Omega(1) = 0$\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of colors is $1 + 0 = 1$.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: By subtracting the two equations, I got (y-x)(y+x-1) = 24. Using factor pairs of 24 with opposite parity (required for integer solutions), I found valid pairs (12,13) and (3,6) with y > x. The smaller y-value is 6, so k = 6 + 18 = 24. Problem 2: Using n = 24 from Problem 1, I need to color divisors of 0! = 1. Since 1 has only one divisor (itself), and the minimum colors equals 1 + Omega(1) = 1 + 0 = 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"24\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
