After 80 balls are moved from Box $A$ to Box $B$, the ratio of balls in Box $A$ to Box $B$ is now $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1$. Find $100p+q$. Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio."
