Now he walks from $(0,0)$ to $(8,0)$ without ever going below the $x$-axis. How many such paths are there? Instead of counting the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,0) that never go below the x-axis, simply find $k = m - 49$, where $m$ is the number of lattice paths from (0,-2) to (8,0) using steps of (+1,+1) or (+1,-1) derived from the reflection principle to count paths that violate the non-negativity condition."

So $m = 7j$ for some integer $j$.\nTherefore: $n = (7j)^2 = 49j^2$\n\n**Finding the range for j:**\nWe need: $10^6 < 49j^2 < 10^9$\n\nDividing by 49:\n$$\\frac{10^6}{49} < j^2 < \\frac{10^9}{49}$$\n\nTaking square roots:\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{10^6}{49}} < j < \\sqrt{\\frac{10^9}{49}}$$\n\n$$\\frac{1000}{7} < j < \\frac{31622.776...}{7}$$\n\n$$142.857... < j < 4517.539...$$\n\n**Counting integer values:**\nTherefore: $143 \\leq j \\leq 4517$\n\n**Verification:**\n- For $j = 143$: $49 \\times 143^2 = 1,002,001 > 10^6$ ✓\n- For $j = 4517$: $49 \\times 4517^2 = 999,761,161 < 10^9$ ✓\n\n**Answer:**\nNumber of values = $4517 - 143 + 1 = 4375$\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: From (0,-2) to (8,0), we need 8 steps total. With a steps of (+1,+1) and b steps of (+1,-1), we have a+b=8 and a-b=2, giving a=5 and b=3. So m = C(8,5) = 56, and k = 56 - 49 = 7. For Problem 2: Numbers that are both multiples of 7 and perfect squares have the form 49j^2. We need 10^6 < 49j^2 < 10^9, which gives 142.857 < j < 4517.539, so 143 ≤ j ≤ 4517, yielding 4375 values.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"7\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4375\"\n}\n```",
