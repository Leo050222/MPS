The probability that there exists a time during this process where there are more blue balls than red balls in the jar can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime integers $a$ and $b$. Compute $100 a+b$.

  "reasoning_content": "Looking at both problems carefully:\n\n## Problem 1: Probability Analysis\n\nWe have 8 red balls and 2 blue balls. We need to find when blue > red.\n\nSince we start with 2 blue balls maximum, for blue > red we need:\n- With 2 blues: red < 2 (so red = 0 or 1)  \n- With 1 blue: red < 1 (so red = 0)\n- With 0 blues: impossible\n\nAfter removing k balls, let b = blues remaining, r = reds remaining.\nWe have b + r = 10 - k, so b > r ⟺ b > (10-k)/2.\n\nChecking each step:\n- k = 7: b > 1.5 requires b = 2\n- k = 8: b > 1 requires b = 2  \n- k = 9: b > 0.5 requires b ≥ 1\n\nThe condition is satisfied if b₇ = 2 OR b₉ ≥ 1.\n\nKey insight: If b₇ = 2 (first 7 balls are red), then we have 1 red and 2 blues left among positions 8, 9, 10. This means b₉ ≥ 1 automatically.\n\nTherefore: P(b₇ = 2 OR b₉ ≥ 1) = P(b₉ ≥ 1)\n\nP(b₉ ≥ 1) = P(at most 1 blue in first 9 balls)\n\nThere are C(10,9) = 10 ways to choose which 9 balls are removed first.\nFor at most 1 blue in first 9:\n- 0 blues in first 9: both blues in position 10 → C(2,0)·C(8,9) = 0 (impossible, only 8 reds)\n- 1 blue in first 9: C(2,1)·C(8,8) = 2·1 = 2\n\nSo P(b₉ ≥ 1) = 2/10 = 1/5\n\nThe probability is 1/5 where a = 1, b = 5.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for something different: \"find n equal to the greatest common divisor of that numerator and denominator plus 2004.\"\n\ngcd(1, 5) = 1, so n = 1 + 2004 = **2005**\n\n## Problem 2: L-Shape Subdivision\n\nAn L-shape made of 3 congruent squares subdivides into 4 smaller L-shapes. This is a self-similar fractal subdivision.\n\nDue to the geometric constraints of fitting 4 L-shapes into the original L-shape, the subdivision pattern distributes the L-shapes among 4 possible orientations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°).\n\nFor a symmetric subdivision, each of the 4 smaller L-shapes appears in one of the 4 orientations. This gives a transition where each orientation produces one L in each of the 4 orientations.\n\nUsing a circulant matrix model where orientation i produces one L in each orientation:\n- After 0 subdivisions: 1 L in original orientation\n- After 1 subdivision: 4 total L-shapes, distributed 1 in each orientation\n- After n subdivisions: 4ⁿ total L-shapes\n\nThe matrix multiplication shows that L-shapes distribute evenly among the 4 orientations.\n\nAfter n subdivisions with L₀ = [1, 0, 0, 0]ᵀ:\nLₙ = 4ⁿ⁻¹ · [1, 1, 1, 1]ᵀ for n ≥ 1\n\nTherefore, after 2005 subdivisions:\n- Total L-shapes: 4²⁰⁰⁵\n- L-shapes in original orientation: 4²⁰⁰⁵/4 = **4²⁰⁰⁴**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: The probability that blue > red at some point is 1/5. The problem asks for gcd(1,5) + 2004 = 1 + 2004 = 2005. For Problem 2: The L-shapes distribute evenly among 4 orientations through the subdivision process. After 2005 subdivisions, 1/4 of the 4^2005 L-shapes are in the original orientation, giving 4^2004.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2005\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4^2004\"\n}\n```",
