Every minute, the ant walks one inch along rightwards along the rubber band, but then the band is stretched (uniformly) by one inch. For what value of $n$ will the ant reach the right end during the $n$th minute? Instead of determining the minute during which the ant reaches the right end, simply find $e = p + \\frac{23}{4}$, where $p$ is the portion of the rubber band's length traversed by the ant during the first minute accounting for the uniform stretch."

The ant's position scales to 5/4 inches, giving proportion p = (5/4)/5 = 1/4. Thus e = 1/4 + 23/4 = 6. For Problem 2: Students must leave from the ends to avoid passing. There are 2^5 = 32 valid orderings out of 6! = 720 total. Probability of passing = 1 - 32/720 = 43/45.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"43/45\"\n        }",
