If each of these rays intersects the polygon again at one of its vertices, we say $n$ is $m$-cut. Compute the smallest positive integer $n$ that is both 3-cut and 4-cut.

Alice places an apple beneath one of the points, then picks five of the other seven points and reveals that none of them are hiding the apple.

  "reasoning_content": "Looking at these problems, I'll solve them systematically.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nTo understand when a regular $n$-gon is $m$-cut, I need to analyze the geometry.\n\nIn a regular $n$-gon inscribed in a circle:\n- The interior angle at each vertex is $\\frac{(n-2) \\cdot 180°}{n}$\n- By the inscribed angle theorem, the angle from vertex $V_0$ to vertex $V_k$ (measured from side $V_0V_1$) is $(k-1) \\cdot \\frac{180°}{n}$\n\nWhen we divide the interior angle at $V_0$ into $m$ equal parts:\n- The $j$-th dividing ray makes angle $j \\cdot \\frac{(n-2) \\cdot 180°}{m \\cdot n}$ with side $V_0V_1$\n- For this ray to pass through vertex $V_k$, we need:\n$$j \\cdot \\frac{(n-2) \\cdot 180°}{m \\cdot n} = (k-1) \\cdot \\frac{180°}{n}$$\n\nSimplifying: $k = j \\cdot \\frac{n-2}{m} + 1$\n\nFor $k$ to be an integer for all $j = 1, 2, \\ldots, m-1$, we need $m | (n-2)$.\n\nTherefore:\n- For $n$ to be 3-cut: $3 | (n-2)$\n- For $n$ to be 4-cut: $4 | (n-2)$\n- For both: $\\text{lcm}(3,4) = 12$ divides $(n-2)$\n\nHowever, the problem asks for: $k = t - \\frac{23}{2}$ where $t = \\text{lcm}(3,4) = 12$\n\nTherefore: $k = 12 - \\frac{23}{2} = 12 - 11.5 = 0.5$\n\n## Problem 2\n\nAlice places an apple at one of 8 points on a circle, then reveals 5 of the other 7 points. Bob must bomb one point and wins if he hits the apple or an adjacent point.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of 3 unrevealed points (including the one with the apple).\n\nFor each bombing location $p$, let $N(p)$ = number of points in $S$ that are either $p$ itself or adjacent to $p$.\n\nBob will choose $p$ to maximize $N(p)$, giving him success probability $\\frac{\\max_p N(p)}{3}$.\n\nAlice wants to minimize $\\max_p N(p)$.\n\n**Key observation:** The 3 points in $S$ together with their neighbors cover at most 9 distinct points (each point in $S$ plus its 2 neighbors). Since there are only 8 points on the circle, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one point must be covered by at least 2 points from $S$. Therefore $\\max_p N(p) \\geq 2$.\n\n**Achieving the bound:** Consider $S = \\{0, 3, 6\\}$ (approximately evenly spaced):\n- Most points $p$ satisfy $N(p) = 1$\n- Only point 7 (adjacent to both 0 and 6) satisfies $N(7) = 2$\n- Therefore $\\max_p N(p) = 2$\n\nThis is optimal for Alice. Bob bombs the point with $N(p) = 2$ and wins with probability $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nBy symmetry, this analysis applies regardless of where Alice places the apple initially.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: An n-gon is m-cut if and only if m divides (n-2). For both 3-cut and 4-cut, we need lcm(3,4)=12 to divide (n-2). The problem asks for k = t - 23/2 where t = lcm(3,4) = 12, giving k = 0.5. For Problem 2: Alice reveals 5 points leaving 3 unrevealed. For any set S of 3 points, at least one bombing location p covers 2 points from S (the point and/or its neighbors). Alice can achieve exactly this bound by spacing the unrevealed points approximately evenly (e.g., {0,3,6}). Bob then bombs optimally to win with probability 2/3.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"0.5\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"2/3\"\n        }",
