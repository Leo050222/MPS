In each pair, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is knocked out of the tournament. The probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other during the tournament is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of evaluating the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator representing the probability that the two designated players meet during the tournament, simply find $e = b - 16$, where $b$ is the denominator of that probability when expressed as a reduced fraction."

The probability both advance is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThis gives us:\n$$P_n = \\frac{1}{n-1} + \\frac{n-2}{n-1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot P_{n/2}$$\n\n**Computing the values:**\n\nBase case: $P_2 = 1$ (two players must play each other)\n\n$P_4 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$P_8 = \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{6}{56} = \\frac{8+6}{56} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n$P_{16} = \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{14}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{14}{240} = \\frac{16+14}{240} = \\frac{1}{8}$\n\n$P_{32} = \\frac{1}{31} + \\frac{30}{31} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{31} + \\frac{30}{992} = \\frac{32+30}{992} = \\frac{62}{992} = \\frac{1}{16}$\n\n**Pattern:** $P_{2^k} = \\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}$\n\nFor $n = 32 = 2^5$, we have $P_{32} = \\frac{1}{16}$ in reduced form.\n\nTherefore, $a = 1$ and $b = 16$ (which are relatively prime).\n\nThe answer is: $e = b - 16 = 16 - 16 = 0$\n\n## Problem 2: Finding $(p, c)$\n\nFor small $x$, I need to expand $(1+x)^{10}$:\n$$(1+x)^{10} = 1 + 10x + 45x^2 + 120x^3 + \\ldots$$\n\nNow:\n$$\\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}} = \\frac{-10x - 45x^2 - 120x^3 - \\ldots}{2 + 10x + 45x^2 + \\ldots}$$\n\nSimplifying:\n$$= \\frac{-10x(1 + 4.5x + 12x^2 + \\ldots)}{2(1 + 5x + 22.5x^2 + \\ldots)}$$\n\n$$= -5x \\cdot \\frac{1 + 4.5x + 12x^2 + \\ldots}{1 + 5x + 22.5x^2 + \\ldots}$$\n\nUsing the expansion $\\frac{1}{1+y} \\approx 1 - y + y^2 - \\ldots$ for small $y$:\n\n$$\\frac{1 + 4.5x + \\ldots}{1 + 5x + \\ldots} = (1 + 4.5x + \\ldots)(1 - 5x + 2.5x^2 + \\ldots)$$\n\n$$= 1 - 0.5x + O(x^2)$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$\\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}} = -5x + 2.5x^2 + O(x^3)$$\n\nMultiplying by $x^p$:\n$$x^p \\left(\\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}}\\right) = -5x^{p+1} + 2.5x^{p+2} + \\ldots$$\n\nFor this to be approximately constant for all small $x$, we need $p + 1 = 0$, giving $p = -1$.\n\nWith $p = -1$:\n$$x^{-1} \\left(\\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}}\\right) = -5 + 2.5x + O(x^2)$$\n\nFor $x < 10^{-100}$, the error term $|2.5x + O(x^2)| < 2.6 \\times 10^{-100} \\ll 0.1$.\n\nTherefore, $c = -5$ and $p = -1$, giving $(p, c) = (-1, -5)$.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I derived a recurrence relation for the probability that two players meet in a knockout tournament, finding that P_32 = 1/16, so e = b - 16 = 0.
