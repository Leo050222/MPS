  "math_problem": "Two different numbers are randomly selected from the set $\\{-3, -1, 0, 2, 4\\}$ and then multiplied together. What is the probability that the product of the two numbers chosen is 0? Instead of determining the probability that the product of the two selected numbers is zero, simply find $k = |S| + 2016$, where $|S|$ is the number of elements in the given set. Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers for which $45a + b = k$. What is the minimum possible value of $a + b$?",

Thus k = 5 + 2016 = 2021. For the equation 45a + b = 2021 with positive integers a and b, we have b = 2021 - 45a. For b to be positive, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ 44. To minimize a + b = 2021 - 44a, we maximize a. With a = 44, we get b = 41, giving a + b = 85.\",\n    \"answer\": \"85\"\n}",
