  "math_problem": "Pablo has 27 solid $1 \\\\times 1 \\\\times 1$ cubes that he assembles in a larger $3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 3$ cube. If 10 of the smaller cubes are red, 9 are blue, and 8 are yellow, what is the smallest possible surface area of the larger cube that is red? Instead of determining the minimal total exposed face area contributed by the red small cubes on the surface of the assembled large cube, simply find $d = n + 20$, where $n$ is the number of red small cubes placed in positions exposing three faces in the assembly that achieves this minimum. What is the tens digit of the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of $d$, $(d - 4)$, and $(d + 1996)$?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to work through several steps.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the 3×3×3 cube structure\n\nIn a 3×3×3 cube made of 27 unit cubes, the positions can be categorized by how many faces they expose:\n- **Corner cubes (8 total)**: Each exposes 3 faces\n- **Edge cubes (12 total)**: Each exposes 2 faces  \n- **Face cubes (6 total)**: Each exposes 1 face\n- **Center cube (1 total)**: Exposes 0 faces\n\nTotal: 8 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 27 ✓\n\n## Step 2: Minimizing red surface area\n\nWe have 10 red cubes to place. To minimize the red surface area, we should place red cubes in positions with the fewest exposed faces:\n\n**Optimal placement:**\n- 1 red cube in center position: 0 faces exposed\n- 6 red cubes in face positions: 6 faces exposed (6 × 1)\n- 3 red cubes in edge positions: 6 faces exposed (3 × 2)\n- 0 red cubes in corner positions: 0 faces exposed\n\n**Total red surface area:** 0 + 6 + 6 = 12 square units\n\n## Step 3: Finding n and d\n\nFrom the problem, $n$ is the number of red cubes in corner positions (exposing 3 faces) in the optimal configuration.\n\nFrom our optimal placement: **n = 0**\n\nTherefore: **d = n + 20 = 0 + 20 = 20**\n\n## Step 4: Finding the LCM\n\nI need to find the smallest positive integer divisible by:\n- d = 20\n- d - 4 = 16\n- d + 1996 = 2016\n\nThis is LCM(20, 16, 2016).\n\n**Prime factorizations:**\n- 20 = 2² × 5\n- 16 = 2⁴\n- 2016 = 2⁵ × 3² × 7 (checking: 2016 ÷ 32 = 63 = 9 × 7)\n\n**LCM = 2⁵ × 3² × 5 × 7**\n\nCalculating:\n- 2⁵ = 32\n- 3² = 9\n- LCM = 32 × 9 × 5 × 7 = 32 × 315 = 10,080\n\n**Verification:**\n- 10,080 ÷ 20 = 504 ✓\n- 10,080 ÷ 16 = 630 ✓\n- 10,080 ÷ 2016 = 5 ✓\n\n## Step 5: Finding the tens digit\n\nThe number is 10,080.\n\nBreaking it down by place value: 10,080 = 10,000 + 0 + 80 + 0\n\nThe tens digit is **8**.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"To minimize red surface area in a 3×3×3 cube with 10 red cubes, place them optimally: 1 in center (0 faces), 6 in face positions (6 faces), 3 in edge positions (6 faces), and 0 in corners (0 faces). Thus n=0 red cubes in corners, giving d=20. The LCM of 20, 16, and 2016 is 10,080 (= 2^5 × 3^2 × 5 × 7). The tens digit of 10,080 is 8.\",\n    \"answer\": \"8\"\n}",
