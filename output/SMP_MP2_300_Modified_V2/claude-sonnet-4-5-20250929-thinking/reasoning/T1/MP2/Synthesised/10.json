  "math_problem": "Each of four doors is randomly either open or closed. What is the probability that exactly two of the four doors are open? Instead of determining the probability of exactly two open doors among the four, simply find $Pr$, where $Pr$ is the probability that exactly two of the four doors are open derived from counting the favorable configurations among all possible states of the doors. The line with equation $y=2x-(Pr + 45/8)$ is translated upwards by 4 units. What is the $x$-intercept of the resulting line?",
  "reasoning_content": "**Step-by-step solution:**\n\n**Step 1: Find the probability Pr**\n\nEach of the four doors can be either open or closed, giving us 2 states per door.\n- Total possible configurations: $2^4 = 16$\n\nTo have exactly 2 doors open out of 4, we need to count the favorable configurations:\n- Number of ways to choose which 2 doors are open: $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$\n\nTherefore:\n$$Pr = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}$$\n\n**Step 2: Write the original line equation**\n\nThe original line is:\n$$y = 2x - (Pr + \\frac{45}{8})$$\n\nSubstituting $Pr = \\frac{3}{8}$:\n$$y = 2x - (\\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{45}{8})$$\n$$y = 2x - \\frac{48}{8}$$\n$$y = 2x - 6$$\n\n**Step 3: Translate the line upwards by 4 units**\n\nWhen a line is translated upwards by 4 units, we add 4 to the y-value:\n$$y = 2x - 6 + 4$$\n$$y = 2x - 2$$\n\n**Step 4: Find the x-intercept**\n\nThe x-intercept occurs when $y = 0$:\n$$0 = 2x - 2$$\n$$2x = 2$$\n$$x = 1$$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found the probability that exactly 2 of 4 doors are open: Pr = 6/16 = 3/8. Then I substituted this into the line equation y = 2x - (3/8 + 45/8) = 2x - 6. After translating upwards by 4 units, the new line is y = 2x - 2. Setting y = 0 to find the x-intercept gives x = 1.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
