  "math_problem": "Anna thinks of an integer that is not a multiple of three, not a perfect square, and the sum of its digits is a prime number. What could the integer be? Instead of identifying an integer satisfying the conditions on multiples of three, perfect squares, and prime digit sums, simply find $k$ equal to the sum of the digits of such an integer plus 108. Ewan writes out a sequence where he counts by $(k - 102)$s starting at $(k - 110)$. Which number will appear in Ewan's sequence?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to work through it systematically.\n\n## Step 1: Find an integer satisfying the conditions\n\nI need an integer that is:\n- Not a multiple of three\n- Not a perfect square  \n- Has a digit sum that is prime\n\nLet me try the number **5**:\n- Not a multiple of 3 ✓\n- Not a perfect square ✓\n- Sum of digits = 5 (which is prime) ✓\n\n## Step 2: Calculate k\n\nk = (sum of digits) + 108 = 5 + 108 = **113**\n\n## Step 3: Determine Ewan's sequence\n\nEwan counts by (k - 102)s starting at (k - 110):\n- Starting value: k - 110 = 113 - 110 = **3**\n- Increment: k - 102 = 113 - 102 = **11**\n\nSo Ewan's sequence is: 3, 14, 25, 36, 47, 58, 69, 80, 91, 102, 113, 124, ...\n\nThe general term is: 3 + 11n where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n## Step 4: Verify that k appears in the sequence\n\nDoes 113 appear in the sequence?\nSetting 3 + 11n = 113:\n- 11n = 110\n- n = 10 ✓\n\nYes! When n = 10, we get 3 + 11(10) = 113\n\n## Step 5: Answer the question\n\nThe question asks \"Which number will appear in Ewan's sequence?\" Given the structure of the problem (where we calculated k and then created a sequence based on k), the natural answer is that **k itself** appears in the sequence.\n\nWe can verify this mathematically: For k to appear in its own sequence:\n- k = (k - 110) + n(k - 102)\n- k = k - 110 + nk - 102n\n- 0 = -110 + n(k - 102)\n- n(k - 102) = 110\n\nWith k = 113: n(11) = 110, so n = 10, which is a valid non-negative integer.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"I found an integer satisfying the conditions (e.g., 5) with digit sum 5, giving k = 113. Ewan's sequence starts at 3 and counts by 11s: {3, 14, 25, 36, ..., 102, 113, ...}. The number k = 113 appears in the sequence at n = 10.\",\n    \"answer\": \"113\"\n}",
