  "math_problem": "A cube has an edge length of 30. A rectangular solid has edge lengths 20, 30, and $L$. If the cube and the rectangular solid have equal surface areas, what is the value of $L$? Instead of determining the third edge length of the rectangular solid, simply find $h = S - 5397$, where $S$ is the surface area of the cube. The line with equation $y = x$ is translated $h$ units to the right and $(h - 1)$ units down. What is the $y$-intercept of the resulting line?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Find the surface area S of the cube\n2. Calculate h = S - 5397\n3. Apply the translation to the line y = x\n4.

Then calculated h = S - 5397 = 5400 - 5397 = 3. The line y = x is translated 3 units right and 2 units down (h - 1 = 2). Translating right by h replaces x with (x - h), and translating down by k subtracts k from y. So y = x becomes y = (x - 3) - 2 = x - 5. The y-intercept is found by setting x = 0: y = -5.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-5\"\n}",
