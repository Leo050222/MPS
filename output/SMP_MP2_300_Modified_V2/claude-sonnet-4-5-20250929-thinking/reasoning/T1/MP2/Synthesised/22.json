  "math_problem": "An electric car is charged 3 times per week for 52 weeks. The cost to charge the car each time is $0.78. What is the total cost to charge the car over these 52 weeks? Instead of computing the overall expenditure, simply find $t_c$, the total number of charging sessions over the 52 weeks. If $4x + (t_c - 142) = 8x - 48$, what is the value of $2x$?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Find $t_c$ (total charging sessions)\n2. Use it to solve the equation for $x$\n3.
