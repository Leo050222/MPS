  "math_problem": "When three consecutive integers are added, the total is 27. What is the result when the same three integers are multiplied? Instead of determining the product of the three consecutive integers, simply find $p = \\left(m - \\frac{177}{20}\\right)$, where $m$ is the middle integer among the three consecutive integers. If $x \\%$ of 60 is 12, what is $100\\left(p\\right) \\%$ of $x$?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem step by step:\n\n## Step 1: Find the three consecutive integers\n\nLet the three consecutive integers be $(n-1)$, $n$, and $(n+1)$ where $n$ is the middle integer.\n\nTheir sum is:\n$(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n = 27$\n\nSolving: $n = 9$\n\nSo the three consecutive integers are **8, 9, and 10**, with middle integer $m = 9$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate p\n\n$p = m - \\frac{177}{20}$\n\n$p = 9 - \\frac{177}{20}$\n\n$p = \\frac{180}{20} - \\frac{177}{20}$\n\n$p = \\frac{3}{20}$\n\n## Step 3: Find x\n\nGiven: $x\\%$ of 60 is 12\n\n$\\frac{x}{100} \\times 60 = 12$\n\n$60x = 1200$\n\n$x = 20$\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $100(p)\\%$ of $x$\n\nFirst, find $100p$:\n$100p = 100 \\times \\frac{3}{20} = \\frac{300}{20} = 15$\n\nNow find $15\\%$ of $x = 20$:\n$\\frac{15}{100} \\times 20 = \\frac{300}{100} = 3$\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Starting with three consecutive integers that sum to 27, I found them to be 8, 9, and 10, with middle integer m=9. Then p = 9 - 177/20 = 3/20. From x% of 60 = 12, I got x = 20. Finally, 100p% of x means 15% of 20, which equals 3.\",\n  \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
