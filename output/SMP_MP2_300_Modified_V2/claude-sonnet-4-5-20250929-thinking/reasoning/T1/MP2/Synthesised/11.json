  "math_problem": "Consider positive integers $a \\leq b \\leq c \\leq d \\leq e$. There are $N$ lists $a, b, c, d, e$ with a mean of 2023 and a median of 2023, in which the integer 2023 appears more than once, and in which no other integer appears more than once. What is the sum of the digits of $N$? Instead of computing the sum of the digits of the total number of such ordered quintuples, simply find $N$, the total number of such ordered quintuples. In Rad's garden there are exactly 30 red roses, exactly 19 yellow roses, and no other roses. How many of the yellow roses does Rad need to remove so that $\\left(N - \\frac{21464546}{7}\\right)$ of the roses in the garden are yellow?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to first find $N$, then use it to solve the rose problem.\n\n## Finding N\n\nI need to count ordered quintuples $(a, b, c, d, e)$ where:\n- $a \\leq b \\leq c \\leq d \\leq e$ (positive integers)\n- Mean = 2023, so $a + b + c + d + e = 10115$\n- Median = 2023, so $c = 2023$\n- 2023 appears more than once\n- No other integer appears more than once\n\nSince $c = 2023$ and 2023 must appear at least twice, I'll consider cases based on how many times 2023 appears.\n\n### Case 1a: $b = c = 2023$ (exactly 2 times)\n- Need $a < 2023$, $d > 2023$, $e > d$ (so $d \\neq e$)\n- Constraint: $a + d + e = 6069$\n\nFor each $a \\in [1, 2020]$, I need pairs $(d, e)$ with $2024 \\leq d < e$ and $d + e = 6069 - a$.\n\nThe number of such pairs for fixed $a$ is $\\lfloor(6068-a)/2\\rfloor - 2023$.\n\nFor $a = 2k-1$ or $a = 2k$, this equals $1011 - k$.\n\nSum over $a \\in [1, 2020]$: $\\sum_{k=1}^{1010} 2(1011-k) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1010 \\cdot 1011}{2} = 1,021,110$\n\n### Case 1b: $c = d = 2023$ (exactly 2 times)\n- Need $a < b < 2023$, $e > 2023$\n- Constraint: $a + b + e = 6069$\n\nFor all pairs $(a,b)$ with $1 \\leq a < b < 2023$:\n- We get $e = 6069 - a - b$\n- Since max$(a+b) = 2021 + 2022 = 4043 < 4046$, we have $e > 2023$ ✓\n\nCount: $\\binom{2022}{2} = \\frac{2022 \\cdot 2021}{2} = 2,043,231$\n\n### Case 2a: $b = c = d = 2023$ (exactly 3 times)\n- Need $a < 2023$, $e > 2023$\n- Constraint: $a + e = 4046$\n\nFor each $a \\in [1, 2022]$, we get $e = 4046 - a \\in [2024, 4045]$ ✓\n\nCount: $2,022$\n\n### Case 2b: $a = b = c = 2023$ (exactly 3 times)\n- Need $d > 2023$, $e > d$\n- Constraint: $d + e = 4046$\n\nSince $d + e = 4046$ and $d < e$, we need $d < 2023$.
