  "math_problem": "Which of the following numbers is closest to 1: $\\x0crac{11}{10}$, $\\x0crac{111}{100}$, 1.101, $\\x0crac{1111}{1000}$, 1.011? Instead of determining which of the given numbers is closest to 1, simply find $k = d + \\frac{748889}{1000}$, where $d$ is the value of the number in the list expressed as a fraction with denominator 1000. Luca mixes $(k - 700)$ mL of milk for every 250 mL of flour to make pizza dough. How much milk does he mix with $k$ mL of flour?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to work through it step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Find which number is closest to 1\n\nLet me convert all numbers to decimal form and find their distances from 1:\n\n- $\\frac{11}{10} = 1.1$, distance: $|1.1 - 1| = 0.1$\n- $\\frac{111}{100} = 1.11$, distance: $|1.11 - 1| = 0.11$\n- $1.101$, distance: $|1.101 - 1| = 0.101$\n- $\\frac{1111}{1000} = 1.111$, distance: $|1.111 - 1| = 0.111$\n- $1.011$, distance: $|1.011 - 1| = 0.011$\n\nThe smallest distance is 0.011, so **1.011 is closest to 1**.\n\n## Step 2: Express as a fraction with denominator 1000\n\n$d = 1.011 = \\frac{1011}{1000}$\n\n## Step 3: Calculate k\n\n$k = d + \\frac{748889}{1000} = \\frac{1011}{1000} + \\frac{748889}{1000} = \\frac{1011 + 748889}{1000} = \\frac{749900}{1000} = 749.9$\n\n## Step 4: Find the milk-to-flour ratio\n\nLuca mixes $(k - 700)$ mL of milk for every 250 mL of flour.\n\n$k - 700 = 749.9 - 700 = 49.9$ mL of milk per 250 mL of flour\n\n## Step 5: Calculate milk for k mL of flour\n\nUsing the ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\text{milk}}{k} = \\frac{49.9}{250}$$\n\n$$\\text{milk} = \\frac{49.9 \\times k}{250} = \\frac{49.9 \\times 749.9}{250}$$\n\nLet me calculate $49.9 \\times 749.9$:\n$$49.9 \\times 749.9 = 49.9 \\times (750 - 0.1) = 49.9 \\times 750 - 49.9 \\times 0.1$$\n$$= 37425 - 4.99 = 37420.01$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$\\text{milk} = \\frac{37420.01}{250} = 149.68004$$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found that 1.011 is closest to 1 (distance 0.011). Expressing this as a fraction with denominator 1000 gives d = 1011/1000. Then k = 1011/1000 + 748889/1000 = 749900/1000 = 749.9. Since Luca mixes (k-700) = 49.9 mL of milk per 250 mL of flour, for k = 749.9 mL of flour, the milk needed is (49.9 × 749.9)/250 = 37420.01/250 = 149.68004 mL.\",\n    \"answer\": \"149.68004\"\n}",
