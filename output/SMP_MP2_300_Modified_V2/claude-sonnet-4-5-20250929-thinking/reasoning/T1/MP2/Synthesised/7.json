  "math_problem": "The product of $N$ consecutive four-digit positive integers is divisible by $2010^{2}$. What is the least possible value of $N$? Instead of determining the smallest such $N$, simply find $e = v_5(\\ell) - 2$, where $\\ell$ is the largest four-digit multiple of $25$ that is less than $2 \\times 67^2$. The area of the triangular region bounded by the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis and the line with equation $y=2x-(e + 6)$ is one-quarter of the area of the triangular region bounded by the $x$-axis, the line with equation $y=2x-(e + 6)$ and the line with equation $x=d$, where $d>e$. What is the value of $d$?",

The largest four-digit multiple of 25 less than this is ℓ = 8975 = 359×25 = 359×5². Since 359 is not divisible by 5, v₅(8975) = 2. Therefore e = 2-2 = 0. The line equation becomes y = 2x-6. Triangle 1 (bounded by x-axis, y-axis, and the line) has vertices (0,0), (3,0), (0,-6) with area 9. Triangle 2 (bounded by x-axis, the line, and x=d) has area (d-3)² for d>3.
