Instead of determining the numerical value of the given algebraic expression, simply find \\( k = v - 1 \\), where \\( v \\) is the quantity defined in terms of \\( x \\) as stated.

The original line is y = 3x + 5. This line is translated (k - 3) = 2 units to the right. When translating a line h units to the right, we replace x with (x - h). So y = 3(x - 2) + 5 = 3x - 6 + 5 = 3x - 1.\",\n    \"answer\": \"y = 3x - 1\"\n}",
