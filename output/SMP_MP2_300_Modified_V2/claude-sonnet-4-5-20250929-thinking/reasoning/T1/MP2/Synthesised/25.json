  "math_problem": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$. Shuxin begins with $d$ red candies, $(d - 3)$ yellow candies, and $(d - 7)$ blue candies. After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining. What is the smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate?",
  "reasoning_content": "## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n### Part 1: Finding k and d\n\nGiven information:\n- Ratio of skateboards to bicycles is 7:4\n- Number of skateboards = 7k, number of bicycles = 4k\n- There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles\n\nSetting up the equation:\n$$7k - 4k = 12$$\n$$3k = 12$$\n$$k = 4$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$d = k + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10$$\n\n### Part 2: The Candy Problem\n\nInitial candies:\n- Red candies: $d = 10$\n- Yellow candies: $d - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7$\n- Blue candies: $d - 7 = 10 - 7 = 3$\n- Total initial candies: $10 + 7 + 3 = 20$\n\nAfter eating some candies, equal numbers of each color remain.\n\nLet $r$ be the number of candies of each color remaining after eating.\n\nConstraints:\n- Red: We ate $(10 - r)$ candies, so $r \\leq 10$\n- Yellow: We ate $(7 - r)$ candies, so $r \\leq 7$\n- Blue: We ate $(3 - r)$ candies, so $r \\leq 3$\n- Also, $r \\geq 0$ (non-negative)\n\nTherefore: $0 \\leq r \\leq 3$\n\nTotal candies eaten:\n$$\\text{Eaten} = (10 - r) + (7 - r) + (3 - r) = 20 - 3r$$\n\nTo minimize candies eaten, we maximize $r$.\n\nMaximum value: $r = 3$\n\nMinimum candies eaten:\n$$20 - 3(3) = 20 - 9 = 11$$\n\nVerification:\n- Ate: 7 red, 4 yellow, 0 blue (total = 11)\n- Remaining: 3 red, 3 yellow, 3 blue (all equal ✓)\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found k = 4 from the skateboard/bicycle problem (7k - 4k = 12), so d = k + 6 = 10. Shuxin starts with 10 red, 7 yellow, and 3 blue candies. After eating some, equal numbers of each color remain. If r candies of each color remain, then r ≤ 3 (limited by blue). Total eaten = 20 - 3r. To minimize candies eaten, maximize r = 3, giving 20 - 9 = 11 candies eaten.\",\n    \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
