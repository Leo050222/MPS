  "math_problem": "Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. Friday, at which point it had been on for exactly 100 hours. At what time had Kamile turned her computer on? Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day. Three different numbers from the list $2, 3, 4, 6$ have a sum of $k$. What is the product of these numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Find the remainder $h$ when dividing 100 hours by 24 hours (one day)**\n\nThe computer was on for 100 hours. To find the remainder when dividing by 24:\n$$100 = 24 \\times 4 + 4$$\n\nSo $h = 4$ (the remainder)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate $k$**\n\nAccording to the problem:\n$$k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11$$\n\n**Step 3: Find three different numbers from {2, 3, 4, 6} that sum to $k = 11$**\n\nLet me check all possible combinations of three numbers:\n- $2 + 3 + 4 = 9$ ✗\n- $2 + 3 + 6 = 11$ ✓\n- $2 + 4 + 6 = 12$ ✗\n- $3 + 4 + 6 = 13$ ✗\n\nThe three numbers that sum to 11 are: **2, 3, and 6**\n\n**Step 4: Find the product of these numbers**\n\n$$2 \\times 3 \\times 6 = 36$$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found the remainder when 100 hours is divided by 24 hours: 100 = 24×4 + 4, so h = 4. Then k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11. Next, I checked which three different numbers from {2, 3, 4, 6} sum to 11: 2 + 3 + 6 = 11. Finally, the product is 2 × 3 × 6 = 36.\",\n    \"answer\": \"36\"\n}",
