  "math_problem": "Solve for $2d$ if $10d + 8 = 528$. Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance $s$ equal to that solution plus 48. Megan and Hana raced their remote control cars for $s$ m. The two cars started at the same time. The average speed of Megan's car was $\\frac{5}{4} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Hana's car finished $(s - 95)$ seconds before Megan's car. What was the average speed of Hana's car?",

Then s = d + 48 = 100 meters. Megan's car traveled 100 m at 5/4 m/s, taking 80 seconds. Hana finished (100-95) = 5 seconds earlier, so she took 75 seconds. Therefore, Hana's speed = 100/75 = 4/3 m/s.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4/3\"\n}",
