  "math_problem": "In her last basketball game, Jackie scored 36 points. These points raised the average number of points that she scored per game from 20 to 21. To raise this average to 22 points, how many points must Jackie score in her next game? Instead of determining the score required in the subsequent game to achieve the next targeted average, simply find total_after, where total_after is the cumulative points scored upon attaining the intermediate average following the recent game. Lauren plays basketball with her friends. She makes 10 baskets. Each of these baskets is worth either 2 or (total_after - 333) points. Lauren scores a total of 26 points. How many (total_after - 333) point baskets did she make?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to solve it in two parts.\n\n## Part 1: Finding total_after\n\nJackie scored 36 points in her last game, raising her average from 20 to 21 points per game.\n\nLet $n$ = number of games Jackie played before her last game\n\n**Before the last game:**\n- Games played: $n$\n- Total points: $20n$ (since average was 20)\n\n**After the last game:**\n- Games played: $n + 1$\n- Total points: $20n + 36$\n- Average: 21\n\nSetting up the equation:\n$$\\frac{20n + 36}{n+1} = 21$$\n\nSolving:\n$$20n + 36 = 21(n+1)$$\n$$20n + 36 = 21n + 21$$\n$$36 - 21 = n$$\n$$n = 15$$\n\n**Verification:**\n- Before last game: 15 games, $20 \\times 15 = 300$ points\n- After last game: 16 games, $300 + 36 = 336$ points\n- Average: $336 ÷ 16 = 21$ ✓\n\nTherefore, **total_after = 336**\n\n## Part 2: Lauren's Basketball Problem\n\nNow we know that:\n- total_after = 336\n- Each basket is worth either 2 points or $(336 - 333) = 3$ points\n- Lauren makes 10 baskets total\n- Lauren scores 26 points total\n\nLet:\n- $x$ = number of 2-point baskets\n- $y$ = number of 3-point baskets\n\nSetting up equations:\n1. $x + y = 10$ (total baskets)\n2. $2x + 3y = 26$ (total points)\n\nFrom equation 1: $x = 10 - y$\n\nSubstituting into equation 2:\n$$2(10 - y) + 3y = 26$$\n$$20 - 2y + 3y = 26$$\n$$20 + y = 26$$\n$$y = 6$$\n\n**Verification:**\n- 6 three-point baskets: $6 \\times 3 = 18$ points\n- 4 two-point baskets: $4 \\times 2 = 8$ points\n- Total: $18 + 8 = 26$ points ✓\n- Total baskets: $6 + 4 = 10$ ✓\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found total_after by determining how many games Jackie had played before her last game. Using the average formula, if she played n games before scoring 36 points, then (20n + 36)/(n+1) = 21, which gives n = 15. So total_after = 20(15) + 36 = 336. Then, for Lauren's problem, each basket is worth either 2 or (336-333)=3 points. With 10 total baskets and 26 total points, if y is the number of 3-point baskets, then 2(10-y) + 3y = 26, giving y = 6.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
