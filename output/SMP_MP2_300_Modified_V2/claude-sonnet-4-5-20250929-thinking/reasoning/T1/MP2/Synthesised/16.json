  "math_problem": "Consider the following flowchart: INPUT $\\rightarrow$ Subtract $8 \\rightarrow \\square \\rightarrow$ Divide by $2 \\rightarrow \\square$ Add $16 \\rightarrow$ OUTPUT. If the OUTPUT is 32, what was the INPUT? Instead of determining the initial input value that produces the specified output via the flowchart's sequence of operations, simply find $k = A - 26$, where $A$ is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step. What is the $y$-intercept of the line $y = x + (k - 2)$ after it is translated down $k$ units?",
  "reasoning_content": "Looking at this problem, I need to work through several steps.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Flowchart and Work Backwards\n\nThe flowchart shows:\nINPUT → Subtract 8 → □ → Divide by 2 → □ → Add 16 → OUTPUT\n\nGiven: OUTPUT = 32\n\nLet me denote:\n- INPUT = x\n- First □ (after Subtract 8) = A\n- Second □ (after Divide by 2) = B\n- OUTPUT = 32\n\nWorking backwards:\n- Before \"Add 16\": B = 32 - 16 = 16\n- Before \"Divide by 2\": A = 16 × 2 = 32\n- Before \"Subtract 8\": INPUT = 32 + 8 = 40\n\nSo A = 32 (the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step)\n\n## Step 2: Calculate k\n\nk = A - 26 = 32 - 26 = 6\n\n## Step 3: Find the Original Line\n\nThe line is: y = x + (k - 2)\n\nSubstituting k = 6:\ny = x + (6 - 2) = x + 4\n\nThe y-intercept of this line (when x = 0) is 4.\n\n## Step 4: Translate the Line Down k Units\n\nTranslating down k = 6 units means subtracting 6 from the y-values:\ny_new = (x + 4) - 6 = x - 2\n\n## Step 5: Find the Y-Intercept of the Translated Line\n\nWhen x = 0:\ny_new = 0 - 2 = -2\n\nThe y-intercept of the translated line is **-2**.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Working backwards from OUTPUT = 32: B = 32 - 16 = 16, A = 16 × 2 = 32, INPUT = 32 + 8 = 40. So A = 32. Then k = A - 26 = 32 - 26 = 6. The original line is y = x + (6 - 2) = x + 4. After translating down 6 units: y = x + 4 - 6 = x - 2. The y-intercept is -2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-2\"\n}",
