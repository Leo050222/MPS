  "reasoning_content": "## Problem 1 Solution\n\nGiven: $x + xy = 391$ where $x, y$ are positive integers and $x > y$\n\n**Step 1:** Factor the equation\n$$x + xy = 391$$\n$$x(1 + y) = 391$$\n\n**Step 2:** Find factors of 391\nLet me find the prime factorization:\n$$391 = 17 \\times 23$$\n\nSo the factors of 391 are: 1, 17, 23, 391\n\n**Step 3:** Test each factorization\nSince $x(1 + y) = 391$, we need $x$ to be a factor and $(1 + y)$ to be the complementary factor.\n\n- If $x = 1$, then $1 + y = 391 \\Rightarrow y = 390$. This violates $x > y$.\n- If $x = 17$, then $1 + y = 23 \\Rightarrow y = 22$. This violates $x > y$ since $17 < 22$.\n- If $x = 23$, then $1 + y = 17 \\Rightarrow y = 16$. This satisfies $x > y$ since $23 > 16$. ✓\n- If $x = 391$, then $1 + y = 1 \\Rightarrow y = 0$. This violates the requirement that $y$ is a positive integer.\n\n**Step 4:** Verify the solution\nWith $x = 23$ and $y = 16$:\n$$x + xy = 23 + 23(16) = 23 + 368 = 391$$ ✓\n\n**Step 5:** Calculate $k = y + 14$\n$$k = 16 + 14 = 30$$\n\n## Problem 2 Solution\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate initial composition\n- Total people initially: 30\n- Men (60% of 30): $0.6 \\times 30 = 18$ men\n- Women: $30 - 18 = 12$ women\n\n**Step 2:** Set up equation\nLet $w$ = number of women who must enter\n\nAfter $w$ women enter:\n- Total people: $30 + w$\n- Men: 18 (unchanged)\n- We want men to be 40% of total\n\n**Step 3:** Solve for w\n$$18 = 0.4(30 + w)$$\n$$18 = 12 + 0.4w$$\n$$6 = 0.4w$$\n$$w = \\frac{6}{0.4} = 15$$\n\n**Step 4:** Verify\nAfter 15 women enter:\n- Total people: $30 + 15 = 45$\n- Men: 18\n- Percentage of men: $\\frac{18}{45} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4 = 40\\%$ ✓\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Factored x + xy = 391 to x(1 + y) = 391. Found 391 = 17 × 23. Testing factors with condition x > y gives x = 23, y = 16. Therefore k = y + 14 = 16 + 14 = 30. For Problem 2: Initial 30 people with 60% men means 18 men and 12 women. Need men to be 40% of new total. If w women enter: 18 = 0.4(30 + w), solving gives w = 15.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"30\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"15\"\n}",
