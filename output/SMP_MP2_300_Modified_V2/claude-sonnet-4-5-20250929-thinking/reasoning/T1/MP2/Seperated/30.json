Sum of its digits is a prime number\n\nLet me test some integers systematically:\n\n**Testing 2:**\n- Not a multiple of 3: ✓\n- Not a perfect square: ✓\n- Sum of digits = 2 (prime): ✓\n- This gives k = 2 + 108 = 110\n\n**Testing 14:**\n- Not a multiple of 3: 14 = 4(3) + 2 ✓\n- Not a perfect square: ✓\n- Sum of digits = 1 + 4 = 5 (prime): ✓\n- This gives k = 5 + 108 = 113\n\n**Testing 113:**\n- Not a multiple of 3: 113 = 37(3) + 2 ✓\n- Not a perfect square: √113 ≈ 10.63 ✓\n- Sum of digits = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 (prime): ✓\n- This gives k = 5 + 108 = 113\n\nI notice that 113 is particularly interesting because the calculation yields itself: k = 5 + 108 = 113.\n\n### Problem 2: Ewan's Sequence\n\nEwan counts by 11s starting at 3, so his sequence is:\n- First term: 3\n- Second term: 3 + 11 = 14\n- Third term: 3 + 22 = 25\n- General term: aₙ = 3 + 11(n-1) = 11n - 8\n\nFor a number m to appear in this sequence, we need:\nm ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n\nLet me check if 113 appears:\n113 = 3 + 11k\n110 = 11k\nk = 10\n\nSo 113 = 3 + 11(10) appears in the sequence (it's the 11th term).\n\nGiven the connection between the problems (113 satisfies Anna's conditions and gives k = 113, and 113 also appears in Ewan's sequence), this appears to be the intended answer.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I found that the integer 113 satisfies all of Anna's conditions: it's not a multiple of 3 (113 = 37×3 + 2), not a perfect square (√113 ≈ 10.63), and its digit sum is 5 (which is prime). Therefore k = 5 + 108 = 113. For Problem 2, Ewan's sequence follows the pattern 3, 14, 25, 36, ... where each term is 3 + 11n. The number 113 appears in this sequence as the 11th term (113 = 3 + 11×10). The elegant connection is that both problems lead to the same number: 113.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"113\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"113\"\n        }",
