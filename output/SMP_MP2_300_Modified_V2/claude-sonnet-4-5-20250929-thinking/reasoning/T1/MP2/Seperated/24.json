      "A3034": "A group of friends are sharing a bag of candy. On the first day, they eat $\frac{1}{2}$ of the candies in the bag. On the second day, they eat $\frac{2}{3}$ of the remaining candies. On the third day, they eat $\frac{3}{4}$ of the remaining candies. On the fourth day, they eat $\frac{4}{5}$ of the remaining candies. On the fifth day, they eat $\frac{5}{6}$ of the remaining candies. At the end of the fifth day, there is 1 candy remaining in the bag. How many candies were in the bag before the first day? Instead of determining the initial number of candies in the bag, simply find $k = r - 269$, where $r$ is the number of candies remaining after the first day derived from the consumption on the first day."

When a tile is added:\n- The shared edge (7 cm) is removed from the perimeter\n- Two new edges (2 × 7 = 14 cm) are added to the perimeter\n- Net change: $+7$ cm per tile added\n\nTherefore, for figure $n$:\n$$\\text{Perimeter} = 21 + 7(n-1) = 14 + 7n \\text{ cm}$$\n\nFor perimeter 91 cm:\n$$14 + 7n = 91$$\n$$7n = 77$$\n$$n = 11$$\n\nVerification:\n- Figure 11: Perimeter = $14 + 7(11) = 14 + 77 = 91$ cm ✓\n\nThe figure uses **11 tiles**.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I calculated that the initial number of candies was 720 by working through each day's consumption pattern. After the first day, r = 360 candies remained, so k = 360 - 269 = 91. For Problem 2, I determined that each additional tile adds 7 cm to the perimeter, giving the formula P = 14 + 7n. Solving 14 + 7n = 91 yields n = 11 tiles.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"91\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}\n```",
