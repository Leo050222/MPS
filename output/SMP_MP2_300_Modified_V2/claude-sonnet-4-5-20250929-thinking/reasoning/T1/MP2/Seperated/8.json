  "reasoning_content": "## Problem 1: Finding h = S - 5397\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate the surface area of the cube.\n- A cube has 6 faces, each with area = (edge length)²\n- Edge length = 30\n- Surface area of cube: $S = 6 \\times 30^2 = 6 \\times 900 = 5400$\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate h.\n- $h = S - 5397 = 5400 - 5397 = 3$\n\nNote: The problem statement mentions a rectangular solid with equal surface area, but then explicitly asks us to simply find $h = S - 5397$ instead of finding $L$. So we only need the cube's surface area.\n\n## Problem 2: Finding the y-intercept after translation\n\n**Step 1:** Understand the transformations.\n- Original line: $y = x$\n- Translation: 3 units to the right, 2 units down\n\n**Step 2:** Apply the translation to the line equation.\n- Translating 3 units to the right: Replace $x$ with $(x - 3)$\n  - This gives: $y = x - 3$\n- Translating 2 units down: Subtract 2 from the entire equation\n  - This gives: $y = (x - 3) - 2 = x - 5$\n\n**Step 3:** Find the y-intercept.\n- The y-intercept occurs when $x = 0$\n- Substituting: $y = 0 - 5 = -5$\n\n**Verification:** A point on the original line is $(0, 0)$. After translating 3 units right and 2 units down, this point becomes $(3, -2)$. Check: $-2 = 3 - 5$ ✓\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The surface area of a cube with edge length 30 is S = 6 × 30² = 5400. Therefore, h = S - 5397 = 5400 - 5397 = 3.
