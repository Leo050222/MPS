Your store sells only these two models. You plan to issue 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupons, limited to one per order, where x is an integer greater than 0 and smaller than 99. (For example, the discount for an order of 250 RMB is x RMB, not 2x RMB). The Tmall.com '60 RMB off 299 RMB' coupon can be applied to purchases at store B and can be stacked with your 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupon. What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less on either the 250 RMB pair of the headphones or the 600 RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A? What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less for buying both the 250 RMB pair of the headphones and the 600 RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?"
