If they work together and each continues digging at these same rates, how many holes in total will they dig in 21 days? Instead of determining the total number of holes dug together over the 21-day period, simply find $\\delta = h_m - 8$, where $h_m$ is the number of holes the second worker would dig alone in 21 days derived from his rate of 2 holes in 3 days."

In 21 days, he digs h_m = (2/3) × 21 = 14 holes. Therefore δ = 14 - 8 = 6. For Problem 2: Let b = blue helmets and r = red helmets. From r = b + 6 and r/b = 5/3, we get 3(b+6) = 5b, which gives b = 9 and r = 15. Total = 24.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"24\"\n}\n```",
