      "A3077": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$."

  "reasoning_content": "## Step-by-Step Solutions\n\n### Problem 1:\n\nGiven information:\n- Ratio of skateboards to bicycles is 7:4\n- There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles\n\nLet k be the scaling factor, so:\n- Number of skateboards = 7k\n- Number of bicycles = 4k\n\nSince there were 12 more skateboards than bicycles:\n7k - 4k = 12\n3k = 12\nk = 4\n\nNow I need to find d = k + 6:\nd = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nVerification:\n- Skateboards: 7(4) = 28\n- Bicycles: 4(4) = 16\n- Difference: 28 - 16 = 12 ✓\n\n### Problem 2:\n\nInitial candies:\n- 10 red\n- 7 yellow  \n- 3 blue\n- Total: 20 candies\n\nAfter eating some candies, equal numbers of each color remain. Let n be the number of each color remaining.\n\nConstraints:\n- Since Shuxin only has 3 blue candies, the maximum value of n is 3\n- n must be non-negative\n- We need: 10 - n ≥ 0, 7 - n ≥ 0, and 3 - n ≥ 0\n\nTherefore: 0 ≤ n ≤ 3\n\nCandies eaten:\n- Red eaten: 10 - n\n- Yellow eaten: 7 - n\n- Blue eaten: 3 - n\n- Total eaten: (10 - n) + (7 - n) + (3 - n) = 20 - 3n\n\nTo minimize the number eaten, we maximize n.\nMaximum n = 3\n\nWhen n = 3:\nTotal eaten = 20 - 3(3) = 20 - 9 = 11\n\nVerification:\n- Red: 10 - 7 = 3 remaining ✓\n- Yellow: 7 - 4 = 3 remaining ✓\n- Blue: 3 - 0 = 3 remaining ✓\n- Total eaten: 7 + 4 + 0 = 11 ✓\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Using the ratio 7:4 with scaling factor k, and the condition that there are 12 more skateboards than bicycles, I found k=4 by solving 7k-4k=12. Therefore d=k+6=10. For Problem 2: To have equal numbers of each color remaining, the maximum possible is 3 (limited by blue candies). With 3 of each color remaining, Shuxin ate 7 red, 4 yellow, and 0 blue candies, totaling 11.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}\n```",
