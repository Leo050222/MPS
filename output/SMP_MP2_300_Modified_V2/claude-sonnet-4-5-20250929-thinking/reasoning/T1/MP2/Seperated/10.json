This is a combination problem:\nNumber of ways to choose 2 doors from 4 = $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate probability Pr**\n$Pr = \\frac{\\text{favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total outcomes}} = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate e**\n$e = Pr + \\frac{45}{8} = \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{45}{8} = \\frac{48}{8} = 6$\n\n## Problem 2 Solution\n\n**Step 1: Understand the translation**\nThe original line is $y = 2x - 6$\nTranslating upwards by 4 units means adding 4 to the y-value:\n$y_{new} = (2x - 6) + 4 = 2x - 2$\n\n**Step 2: Find the x-intercept**\nThe x-intercept occurs when $y = 0$:\n$0 = 2x - 2$\n$2x = 2$\n$x = 1$\n\n**Verification:** The original line has x-intercept at $x = 3$ (when $0 = 2x - 6$). After translation, the x-intercept shifts to $x = 1$.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Each door has 2 states, giving 2^4 = 16 total configurations. Exactly 2 doors open can be chosen in C(4,2) = 6 ways. So Pr = 6/16 = 3/8. Then e = 3/8 + 45/8 = 48/8 = 6. Problem 2: Translating y = 2x - 6 upwards by 4 units gives y = 2x - 2.
