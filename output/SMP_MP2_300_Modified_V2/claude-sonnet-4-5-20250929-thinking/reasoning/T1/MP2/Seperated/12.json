Step 2: If $m$ is even, Alicia sets $n=\frac{1}{2} m$. If $m$ is odd, Alicia sets $n=m+1$. Step 3: Alicia writes down the number $m+n+1$ as the next term. Step 4: Alicia sets $m$ equal to the value of the term that she just wrote down in Step 3. Step 5: Alicia repeats Steps 2, 3, 4 until she has five terms, at which point she stops. Instead of determining the fifth term generated by the iterative algorithm, simply find $k$ equal to the fifth term minus 30."
