Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes."

  "reasoning_content": "## Problem 1 Solution:\n\n**Given:**\n- Hard drive capacity: 300 GB\n- Conversion rate: 1 GB = 1024 MB\n- Data stored: 300000 MB\n- Need to find: d = C - 307100, where C is total capacity in MB\n\n**Step-by-step:**\n1. Convert hard drive capacity to MB:\n   - C = 300 GB × 1024 MB/GB\n   - C = 307200 MB\n\n2. Calculate d:\n   - d = C - 307100\n   - d = 307200 - 307100\n   - d = 100\n\n## Problem 2 Solution:\n\n**Given:**\n- Bicycle regular price: $320, on sale 20% off\n- Helmet regular price: $80, on sale 10% off\n\n**Step-by-step:**\n1. Calculate sale price for bicycle:\n   - Discount = 20% × $320 = $64\n   - Sale price = $320 - $64 = $256\n\n2. Calculate sale price for helmet:\n   - Discount = 10% × $80 = $8\n   - Sale price = $80 - $8 = $72\n\n3. Calculate total prices:\n   - Total regular price = $320 + $80 = $400\n   - Total sale price = $256 + $72 = $328\n\n4. Calculate total savings:\n   - Total savings = $400 - $328 = $72\n\n5. Calculate percentage savings:\n   - Percentage = ($72 / $400) × 100%\n   - Percentage = 0.18 × 100%\n   - Percentage = 18%\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Convert 300 GB to MB: 300 × 1024 = 307200 MB.
