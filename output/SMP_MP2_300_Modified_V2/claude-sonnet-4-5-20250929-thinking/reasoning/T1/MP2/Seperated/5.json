Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day."

Dividing 100 by 24 (hours in a day) gives 4 remainder 4, so h = 4. Therefore k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11. For Problem 2: Testing all combinations of three numbers from {2, 3, 4, 6}, only {2, 3, 6} sums to 11. The product is 2 × 3 × 6 = 36.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"36\"\n}\n```",
