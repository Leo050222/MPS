If 10 of the smaller cubes are red, 9 are blue, and 8 are yellow, what is the smallest possible surface area of the larger cube that is red? Instead of determining the minimal total exposed face area contributed by the red small cubes on the surface of the assembled large cube, simply find $d = n + 20$, where $n$ is the number of red small cubes placed in positions exposing three faces in the assembly that achieves this minimum."

Place 1 red cube at the center position → 0 faces exposed\n2. Place 6 red cubes at face center positions → 6 faces exposed (1 each)\n3. Place 3 red cubes at edge positions → 6 faces exposed (2 each)\n\n**Total red surface area:** 0 + 6 + 6 = 12 square units\n\n**Finding n:**\nIn this optimal configuration, the number of red cubes placed at corner positions (which expose 3 faces) is:\n- n = 0 (we avoided corners entirely to minimize surface area)\n\n**Calculating d:**\n- d = n + 20 = 0 + 20 = 20\n\n## Problem 2: Finding the LCM of 20, 16, and 2016\n\n**Prime factorizations:**\n- 20 = 2² × 5\n- 16 = 2⁴\n- 2016: Let me factor this step by step\n  - 2016 ÷ 2 = 1008\n  - 1008 ÷ 2 = 504\n  - 504 ÷ 2 = 252\n  - 252 ÷ 2 = 126\n  - 126 ÷ 2 = 63\n  - 63 ÷ 3 = 21\n  - 21 ÷ 3 = 7\n  - 7 ÷ 7 = 1\n  \n  Therefore: 2016 = 2⁵ × 3² × 7\n\n**Finding LCM:**\nLCM(20, 16, 2016) = 2⁵ × 3² × 5 × 7\n\n**Calculating:**\n- 2⁵ = 32\n- 3² = 9\n- 32 × 9 = 288\n- 288 × 5 = 1440\n- 1440 × 7 = 10,080\n\n**Verification:**\n- 10,080 ÷ 20 = 504 ✓\n- 10,080 ÷ 16 = 630 ✓\n- 10,080 ÷ 2016 = 5 ✓\n\n**Finding the tens digit:**\n10,080 has digits: 1-0-0-8-0\nThe tens digit (second from right) is **8**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: To minimize red surface area with 10 red cubes, place 1 at center (0 faces), 6 at face centers (6 faces), and 3 at edges (6 faces), totaling 12 exposed faces. This uses 0 corner positions, so n=0 and d=n+20=20. For Problem 2: The LCM of 20=2²×5, 16=2⁴, and 2016=2⁵×3²×7 is 2⁵×3²×5×7=10,080. The tens digit of 10,080 is 8.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"20\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"8\"\n}\n```",
