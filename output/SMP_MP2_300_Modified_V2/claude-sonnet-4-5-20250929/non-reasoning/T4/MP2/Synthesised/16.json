Instead of determining all such pairs of monic complex polynomials satisfying the given divisibility conditions, simply find $k = T + 14$, where $T$ is the constant satisfying $P^{2} + Q^{2} + 1 = P Q T$ for pairs $P, Q$ meeting the conditions. $k$ students took part in a competition. All problems were multiple choice style. Each problem had four choices. It was said that any two students had at most one answer in common, find the maximum number of problems.",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Part 1: Finding pairs P(x), Q(x) and the constant T\n\nGiven conditions:\n- P(x) and Q(x) are monic complex polynomials\n- P(x) divides Q(x)² + 1\n- Q(x) divides P(x)² + 1\n\nLet me denote deg(P) = m and deg(Q) = n.\n\nFrom P(x) | Q(x)² + 1, we have Q(x)² + 1 = P(x)R(x) for some polynomial R(x).\nThis gives: deg(Q²) = 2n ≥ deg(P) = m\n\nFrom Q(x) | P(x)² + 1, we have P(x)² + 1 = Q(x)S(x) for some polynomial S(x).\nThis gives: deg(P²) = 2m ≥ deg(Q) = n\n\nFrom these inequalities: 2n ≥ m and 2m ≥ n\n- From 2n ≥ m: 4n ≥ 2m ≥ n, so 4n ≥ n, which gives n ≥ 0\n- From 2m ≥ n: 4m ≥ 2n ≥ m, so 4m ≥ m, which gives m ≥ 0\n\nMore precisely: 2n ≥ m and n ≤ 2m\nCombining: n ≤ 2m and 2n ≥ m, so n ≤ 2m and m ≤ 2n\n\nThis means: n/2 ≤ m ≤ 2n\n\nLet's check small degrees:\n\n**Case m = n = 0:** P and Q are constants (both equal to 1 since monic).\n- P² + 1 = 2, Q² + 1 = 2\n- Q | 2 and P | 2, which works.\n- P² + Q² + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 = 1·1·T, so T = 3\n\n**Case m = n = 1:** P(x) = x + a, Q(x) = x + b\n- Q² + 1 = x² + 2bx + b² + 1 must be divisible by x + a\n- P² + 1 = x² + 2ax + a² + 1 must be divisible by x + b\n\nFor P | Q² + 1: Q(-a)² + 1 = 0, so (-a + b)² + 1 = 0, giving (b - a)² = -1\nFor Q | P² + 1: P(-b)² + 1 = 0, so (-b + a)² + 1 = 0, giving (a - b)² = -1\n\nBoth give (a - b)² = -1, so a - b = ±i\n\nLet's take a - b = i, so a = b + i.\nThen P(x) = x + b + i, Q(x) = x + b\n\nChecking: P² + Q² + 1 = (x + b + i)² + (x + b)² + 1\n= x² + 2(b+i)x + (b+i)² + x² + 2bx + b² + 1\n= 2x² + 2(2b+i)x + b² + 2bi + i² + b² + 1\n= 2x² + 2(2b+i)x + 2b² + 2bi\n\nPQ = (x + b + i)(x + b) = x² + (2b+i)x + b(b+i) = x² + (2b+i)x + b² + bi\n\nFor P² + Q² + 1 = PQT:\n2x² + 2(2b+i)x + 2b² + 2bi = T[x² + (2b+i)x + b² + bi]\n\nComparing coefficients: T = 2\n\n## Part 2: Maximum number of problems\n\nk students, each problem has 4 choices, any two students have at most 1 answer in common.\n\nThis is a coding theory problem. Each student's answer sheet can be viewed as a codeword. With 4 choices per problem and minimum distance ≥ 2n-1 (at most 1 common answer means at least n-1 different answers for n problems).\n\nUsing the Singleton bound for codes over alphabet of size 4:\nk ≤ 4^(n-d+1) where d is minimum distance.\n\nFor at most 1 common answer out of n problems, we need d ≥ n-1.\nSo k ≤ 4^(n-(n-1)+1) = 4² = 16\n\nWhen k = 16 and n = 3, we can have at most 3 problems.\n\nActually, with k students and n problems with 4 choices each, the maximum n occurs when we use a maximum distance separable code. For k = T + 14 = 2 + 14 = 16 students, the maximum is n = 3.\n\nWait, let me recalculate k: k = T + 14 = 2 + 14 = 16\n\nFor 16 students with at most 1 common answer, maximum problems = 3.\n\n{  \n            \"reasoning\": \"First, I found pairs of monic polynomials P(x), Q(x) satisfying the divisibility conditions. For constant polynomials P=Q=1, we get T=3. For linear polynomials, we get T=2. The problem asks for k=T+14 where T satisfies P²+Q²+1=PQT. Using T=2 (the non-trivial case), k=16. Then for the second part: with k=16 students, 4 choices per problem, and any two students having at most 1 answer in common, this is equivalent to finding the maximum length of a code. Using coding theory bounds, the maximum number of problems is 3.\",\n            \"answer\": \"3\"\n        }",
