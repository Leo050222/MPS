  "math_problem": "Two players, $B$ and $R$ , play the following game on an infinite grid of unit squares, all initially colored white. The players take turns starting with $B$ . On $B$ 's turn, $B$ selects one white unit square and colors it blue. On $R$ 's turn, $R$ selects two white unit squares and colors them red. The players alternate until $B$ decides to end the game. At this point, $B$ gets a score, given by the number of unit squares in the largest (in terms of area) simple polygon containing only blue unit squares. What is the largest score $B$ can guarantee?\n(A simple polygon is a polygon (not necessarily convex) that does not intersect itself and has no holes.) Instead of determining the largest score $B$ can guarantee, simply find $m = |P_i| - 2$, where $|P_i|$ is the number of unit squares in each of the disjoint $2 \\times 2$ blocks into which the grid is partitioned to analyze the connectivity of blue squares. Find all $x,y$ and $z$ in positive integers: $z + y^{m} + x^{3} = xyz$ and $x = \\gcd(y,z)$.",
