  "math_problem": "Given $30$ students such that each student has at most $5$ friends and for every $5$ students there is a pair of students that are not friends, determine the maximum $k$ such that for all such possible configurations, there exists $k$ students who are all not friends. Instead of determining the maximum such $k$, simply find $d = \\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) + 1644$, where $\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6)$ is the maximum number of edges in a graph on $30$ vertices with no clique of $6$ vertices derived from the extremal analysis of the complement of the friendship graph. How many real numbers $x$ are solutions to the following equation? $$(d - 1)^{x}+d^{x}=(d + 1)^{x}$$",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nWe need to find $d = \\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) + 1644$, where $\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6)$ is the maximum number of edges in a graph on 30 vertices with no clique of size 6.\n\n## Step 2: Finding $\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6)$\n\nThe Turán theorem tells us that $\\mathrm{ex}(n, K_r)$ is given by the Turán graph $T(n, r-1)$.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6)$, we need the Turán graph $T(30, 5)$ (a complete 5-partite graph on 30 vertices).\n\nThe number of edges in $T(n, r)$ is:\n$$\\mathrm{ex}(n, K_{r+1}) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\frac{n^2}{2} - \\frac{(n \\bmod r)(r - n \\bmod r)}{2r}$$\n\nFor $n = 30$ and $r = 5$:\n- $30 \\bmod 5 = 0$\n\nSo:\n$$\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\frac{30^2}{2} - 0$$\n$$= \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{900}{2}$$\n$$= \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot 450$$\n$$= \\frac{1800}{5}$$\n$$= 360$$\n\n## Step 3: Calculate $d$\n\n$$d = \\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) + 1644 = 360 + 1644 = 2004$$\n\n## Step 4: Solve $(d-1)^x + d^x = (d+1)^x$\n\nWe need to solve:\n$$2003^x + 2004^x = 2005^x$$\n\nDividing by $2005^x$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{2003}{2005}\\right)^x + \\left(\\frac{2004}{2005}\\right)^x = 1$$\n\nLet $a = \\frac{2003}{2005}$ and $b = \\frac{2004}{2005}$.\n\nWe need to solve: $a^x + b^x = 1$\n\nNote that $0 < a < 1$ and $0 < b < 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the function $f(x) = a^x + b^x$\n\n- When $x = 0$: $f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2 > 1$\n- As $x \\to \\infty$: $f(x) \\to 0 < 1$\n- $f'(x) = a^x \\ln(a) + b^x \\ln(b) < 0$ for all $x > 0$ (since $\\ln(a) < 0$ and $\\ln(b) < 0$)\n\nSo $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing for $x > 0$.\n\nSince $f(0) = 2 > 1$ and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = 0 < 1$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists exactly one positive value of $x$ where $f(x) = 1$.\n\n## Step 6: Check for negative values\n\nFor $x < 0$:\n- As $x \\to -\\infty$: $f(x) \\to \\infty$\n- $f(0) = 2$\n- $f'(x) < 0$ for all $x$ (the function is strictly decreasing everywhere)\n\nWait, let me reconsider. For $x < 0$, we have $a^x = (1/a)^{|x|}$ and $b^x = (1/b)^{|x|}$.\n\nSince $a, b < 1$, we have $1/a, 1/b > 1$.\n\nAs $x \\to -\\infty$: $f(x) \\to \\infty$\n\nThe function $f(x)$ is continuous and strictly decreasing for all real $x$. Since $f(0) = 2 > 1$ and $f(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$, there is exactly **one** real solution.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I calculated ex(30, K_6) using Turán's theorem. For a graph on 30 vertices with no K_6 clique, the maximum edges is given by the Turán graph T(30,5), which has 360 edges. Thus d = 360 + 1644 = 2004. Then I solved (2003)^x + (2004)^x = (2005)^x by dividing by (2005)^x to get (2003/2005)^x + (2004/2005)^x = 1. Let f(x) = a^x + b^x where a = 2003/2005 and b = 2004/2005 (both less than 1). At x=0, f(0)=2>1. As x→∞, f(x)→0<1. The derivative f'(x) = a^x ln(a) + b^x ln(b) < 0 for all x since both logarithms are negative. Therefore f(x) is strictly decreasing. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is exactly one real solution.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
