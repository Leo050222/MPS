  "math_problem": "Let $(F_n)$ be the sequence defined recursively by $F_1=F_2=1$ and $F_{n+1}=F_n+F_{n-1}$ for $n\\\\geq 2$. Find all pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ such that\n$$5F_x-3F_y=1.$$ Instead of determining all pairs of positive integers whose corresponding terms in the sequence satisfy the given linear relation equaling one, simply find $k = F_8 - 19$, where $F_8$ denotes the eighth term of the sequence. Find all functions $f:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the equation \\\\[|x|f(y)+yf(x)=f(xy)+f(x^k)+f(f(y))\\\\] for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.",
