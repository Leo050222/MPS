Find all possible values of $x$. Instead of determining all possible real roots of the quartic equation with coefficients given by the side lengths, simply find $k = b + 2013$, where $b$ is the length of side $CA$. Find the numbers of ordered array $(x_1,...,x_{100})$ that satisfies the following conditions: $(i)$ $x_1,...,x_{100} \\in \\{1,2,..,k\\}$; $(ii)$ $k | x_1 + \\dots + x_{100}$; $(iii)$ $k | x_1^2 + \\dots + x_{100}^2$.",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the triangle and circle constraints\n\nTriangle ABC is inscribed in a circle of radius 2 with ∠ABC ≥ 90°.\n\nSince the triangle is inscribed in a circle of radius 2, by the extended law of sines:\n$$\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C} = 2R = 4$$\n\nwhere R = 2 is the circumradius.\n\nSince ∠ABC ≥ 90°, and the angle is at vertex B, the side opposite to B (which is AC = b) must satisfy certain constraints.\n\nFor an inscribed triangle, if ∠ABC = 90°, then AC would be a diameter, so b = 2R = 4.\n\nSince ∠ABC ≥ 90°, we have ∠ABC = 90° (if it were greater than 90°, the triangle would be obtuse at B, but for a triangle inscribed in a circle, the angle subtended by a diameter is exactly 90°).\n\nTherefore, b = CA = 4.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate k\n\nGiven that b = 4:\n$$k = b + 2013 = 4 + 2013 = 2017$$\n\n## Step 3: Count ordered arrays satisfying the conditions\n\nWe need to count ordered arrays $(x_1, ..., x_{100})$ where:\n- (i) $x_i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 2017\\}$ for all i\n- (ii) $2017 | (x_1 + ... + x_{100})$\n- (iii) $2017 | (x_1^2 + ... + x_{100}^2)$\n\nNote that 2017 is prime.\n\nLet $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i$ and $T = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i^2$.\n\nWe need: $S \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$ and $T \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$.\n\n## Step 4: Use generating functions approach\n\nFor each position, we can choose any value from 1 to 2017. Working modulo 2017:\n\nThe total number of arrays without constraints is $2017^{100}$.\n\nFor condition (ii): We need $S \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$.\nThe number of arrays satisfying this is $\\frac{2017^{100}}{2017} = 2017^{99}$.\n\nHowever, we need both conditions simultaneously.\n\n## Step 5: Apply inclusion-exclusion with both constraints\n\nLet's work in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2017}$. For each choice of the first 99 values, we need to count how many choices of $x_{100}$ satisfy both:\n- $x_{100} \\equiv -\\sum_{i=1}^{99} x_i \\pmod{2017}$\n- $x_{100}^2 \\equiv -\\sum_{i=1}^{99} x_i^2 \\pmod{2017}$\n\nLet $s = \\sum_{i=1}^{99} x_i \\bmod 2017$ and $t = \\sum_{i=1}^{99} x_i^2 \\bmod 2017$.\n\nWe need: $x_{100} \\equiv -s \\pmod{2017}$ and $x_{100}^2 \\equiv -t \\pmod{2017}$.\n\nThis means: $(-s)^2 \\equiv -t \\pmod{2017}$, i.e., $s^2 + t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$.\n\nFor a fixed choice of $(x_1, ..., x_{99})$:\n- If $s^2 + t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$, then $x_{100} = -s \\bmod 2017$ works (if it's in range [1, 2017])\n- If $s^2 + t \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$, then no valid $x_{100}$ exists\n\nThe number of valid $(x_1, ..., x_{99})$ pairs $(s,t)$ with $s^2 + t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$ is $2017^{98}$ (by counting argument).\n\nTherefore, the answer is $2017^{99}$.\n\n{  \n            \"reasoning\": \"Triangle ABC inscribed in circle of radius 2 with angle ABC ≥ 90° means angle ABC = 90°, making AC a diameter. Thus b = CA = 4, so k = 2017. For counting arrays: working modulo prime 2017, we need both sum and sum of squares divisible by 2017. Using constraint analysis, for each choice of first 99 elements, there's exactly one valid choice for the 100th element when the constraint s² + t ≡ 0 (mod 2017) is satisfied, which occurs for 2017^98 choices of the first 99 elements. This gives 2017^99 total valid arrays.\",\n            \"answer\": \"2017^99\"\n        }",
