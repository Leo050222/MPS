      "A3384": "One day, there is a Street Art Show at somewhere, and there are some spectators around. We consider this place as an Euclidean plane. Let $K$ be the center of the show. And name the spectators by $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}, \\ldots$ They pick their positions $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}, \\ldots$ one by one. The positions need to satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously. (i) The distance between $K$ and $A_{n}$ is no less than 10 meters, that is, $K P_{n} \\geq 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any positive integer $n$. (ii) The distance between $A_{n}$ and any previous spectator is no less than 1 meter, that is, $P_{m} P_{n} \\geq 1 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any $n \\geq 2$ and any $1 \\leq m \\leq n-1$. (iii) $A_{n}$ always choose the position closest to $K$ that satisfies (i) and (ii), that is, $K P_{n}$ reaches its minimum possible value. If there are more than one point that satisfy (i) and (ii) and have the minimum distance to $K, A_{n}$ may choose any one of them. For example, $A_{1}$ is not restricted by (ii), so he may choose any point on the circle $C$ which is centered at $K$ with radius 10 meters. For $A_{2}$, since there are lots of points on $C$ which are at least 1 meter apart from $P_{1}$, he may choose anyone of them. (1) Which of the following statement is true? (A) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2}$ always hold (unit: meter); (B) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\sqrt{n} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} \\sqrt{n}$ always hold (unit: meter); (C) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n$ always hold (unit: meter); (D) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n^{2} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n^{2}$ always hold (unit: meter)."

All spectators must be at least 10 meters from $K$ (condition i)\n2. Spectators must be at least 1 meter apart (condition ii)\n3. Each new spectator chooses the closest available position to $K$ (condition iii)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nInitially, spectators can place themselves on the circle of radius 10 centered at $K$. As more spectators arrive, they fill up this circle.\n\nThe circumference of a circle at radius $r$ is $2\\pi r$. If spectators must be at least 1 meter apart, the maximum number of spectators that can fit on a circle of radius $r$ is approximately $\\frac{2\\pi r}{1} = 2\\pi r$.\n\nStarting at radius 10:\n- On the circle at radius 10, we can fit approximately $2\\pi \\cdot 10 = 20\\pi \\approx 63$ spectators\n- Once this circle is full, new spectators must move to radius 11, where we can fit approximately $2\\pi \\cdot 11 \\approx 69$ spectators\n- And so on...\n\nThe number of spectators that can fit within an annulus from radius $r$ to radius $r+1$ is approximately $2\\pi r$.\n\nTo accommodate $n$ spectators, we need radius approximately $r$ where:\n$$\\sum_{i=10}^{r} 2\\pi i \\approx n$$\n\nThis sum is approximately:\n$$2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{(r-9)(r+10)}{2} \\approx n$$\n$$\\pi(r^2 + r - 90) \\approx n$$\n\nFor large $n$: $r \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{\\pi}}$\n\nThis suggests $KP_n$ grows like $\\sqrt{n}$.\n\n**Verification:**\n- Lower bound: Spectators pack efficiently, so $KP_n \\geq c_1\\sqrt{n}$ for some $c_1 > 0$\n- Upper bound: Even with inefficient packing, $KP_n \\leq c_2\\sqrt{n}$ for some $c_2 > 0$\n\nThe answer is **(B)**: There exist positive real numbers $c_1, c_2$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$ choose their positions, $c_1\\sqrt{n} \\leq KP_n \\leq c_2\\sqrt{n}$ always holds.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: From f_1(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 48), we need to express this as sqrt(x^2 + 6k). This gives 48 = 6k, so k = 8. Therefore e = k - 8 = 0. For Problem 2: Analyzing the packing of spectators around center K with minimum distance 1m between them and minimum distance 10m from K. The number of spectators that can fit at radius r is approximately 2πr. To fit n spectators requires radius approximately sqrt(n/π), indicating KP_n grows like sqrt(n).
