  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nGiven: $P(k) = \\frac{k}{k+1}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n$\n\nWe need to find $q = Q(-1)$ where $Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x$.\n\nFirst, let's understand what $Q(x)$ represents:\n$$Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x$$\n\nLet's evaluate $Q(k)$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n$:\n$$Q(k) = (k+1)P(k) - k = (k+1) \\cdot \\frac{k}{k+1} - k = k - k = 0$$\n\nSo $Q(x)$ has roots at $x = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n$.\n\nSince $P(x)$ has degree $n$, and $Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x$, we see that $Q(x)$ has degree $n+1$.\n\nSince $Q(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n+1$ with roots at $0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n$ (that's $n+1$ roots), we can write:\n$$Q(x) = c \\cdot x(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-n)$$\n\nfor some constant $c$.\n\nTo find $c$, we need another condition. Let's look at the leading coefficient.\n\nFrom $Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x$:\n- The leading term of $(x+1)P(x)$ is $x \\cdot (\\text{leading term of } P(x))$\n- If $P(x)$ has leading coefficient $a_n$, then $(x+1)P(x)$ has leading term $a_n x^{n+1}$\n\nSo the leading coefficient of $Q(x)$ is $a_n$.\n\nOn the other hand, $Q(x) = c \\cdot x(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-n)$ has leading coefficient $c$.\n\nTherefore $c = a_n$.\n\nTo find $a_n$, we use the fact that $P(x)$ is uniquely determined by the $n+1$ conditions $P(k) = \\frac{k}{k+1}$ for $k = 0, 1, \\ldots, n$.\n\nActually, let's reconsider. We have:\n$$Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x$$\n\nAt $x = -1$:\n$$Q(-1) = (-1+1)P(-1) - (-1) = 0 \\cdot P(-1) + 1 = 1$$\n\nWait, that's straightforward!\n\n$$q = Q(-1) = ((-1)+1)P(-1) - (-1) = 0 + 1 = 1$$\n\n## Problem 2\n\nGiven:\n- $|z - 1| = 2$\n- $|z^2 - 1| = 6$\n\nLet $z = x + iy$ where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFrom the first condition:\n$$|z - 1|^2 = |x - 1 + iy|^2 = (x-1)^2 + y^2 = 4$$\n\nFrom the second condition:\n$$|z^2 - 1|^2 = |(z-1)(z+1)|^2 = |z-1|^2 \\cdot |z+1|^2 = 4 \\cdot |z+1|^2 = 36$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$|z+1|^2 = 9$$\n$$|x+1+iy|^2 = (x+1)^2 + y^2 = 9$$\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1. $(x-1)^2 + y^2 = 4$\n2. $(x+1)^2 + y^2 = 9$\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n$$(x+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 9 - 4 = 5$$\n$$(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 5$$\n$$4x = 5$$\n$$x = \\frac{5}{4}$$\n\nTherefore, the real part of $z$ is $\\frac{5}{4}$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x. At x = -1, Q(-1) = 0·P(-1) + 1 = 1. For Problem 2: Using |z-1|=2 and |z^2-1|=6, we get |z+1|=3. Setting z=x+iy gives (x-1)²+y²=4 and (x+1)²+y²=9. Subtracting yields 4x=5, so x=5/4.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"5/4\"\n        }",
