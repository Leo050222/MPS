  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nWe need to find the smallest integer $k \\geq 2$ such that there exist distinct positive integers $m, n \\leq k$ where $k | (n^{n-1} - m^{m-1})$.\n\nLet me check small values of $k$:\n\n**For $k = 2$:** Only $m, n \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ with $m \\neq n$.\n- $2^1 - 1^0 = 2 - 1 = 1$. Not divisible by 2.\n\n**For $k = 3$:** Check pairs from $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n- $2^1 - 1^0 = 1$ (not divisible by 3)\n- $3^2 - 1^0 = 9 - 1 = 8$ (not divisible by 3)\n- $3^2 - 2^1 = 9 - 2 = 7$ (not divisible by 3)\n\n**For $k = 4$:** Check pairs from $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n- $2^1 - 1^0 = 1$ (not divisible by 4)\n- $3^2 - 1^0 = 8$ (divisible by 4!) ✓\n\nSo $k = 4$ is the smallest value where at least one difference is divisible by $k$.\n\nTherefore, $s = k - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nLet the sequence be $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_{2020}$.\n\nFor $i \\geq 3$: $a_i$ is divisible by both $a_{i-1}$ and $(a_{i-2} + a_{i-1})$.\n\nSince $a_i$ is divisible by $a_{i-1}$, we can write $a_i = k_i \\cdot a_{i-1}$ for some positive integer $k_i$.\n\nAlso, $a_i$ must be divisible by $a_{i-2} + a_{i-1}$.\n\nLet's denote $a_1 = a$ and $a_2 = b$ where $a, b$ are positive integers.\n\nFor $a_3$: divisible by $b$ and $(a + b)$.\nSo $a_3 = \\text{lcm}(b, a+b) \\cdot m$ for some positive integer $m$.\n\nTo minimize the sequence, we want $a_3 = \\text{lcm}(b, a+b)$.\n\nIf $\\gcd(b, a+b) = \\gcd(b, a) = d$, then $\\text{lcm}(b, a+b) = \\frac{b(a+b)}{d}$.\n\nTo minimize, let's try $a = b = 1$:\n- $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1$\n- $a_3 = \\text{lcm}(1, 2) = 2$\n- $a_4 = \\text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6$\n- $a_5 = \\text{lcm}(6, 8) = 24$\n- $a_6 = \\text{lcm}(24, 30) = 120$\n\nLet me verify the pattern. If we have a Fibonacci-like structure where each term is the LCM of the previous term and the sum of the two previous terms:\n\nStarting with $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1$:\n- $a_3 = 2$\n- $a_4 = 6$\n- $a_5 = 24$\n- $a_6 = 120$\n- $a_7 = 720$\n\nThis follows the pattern $a_n = n!/2$ for $n \\geq 3$.\n\nFor $n = 2020$: $a_{2020} = 2020!/2$.\n\nHowever, let me reconsider. The pattern suggests that starting with $(1,1)$ gives us a sequence where $a_n$ grows as factorials.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the sequence starting with $(1,1)$ gives:\n$1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, \\ldots$\n\nThis is $(n-1)!$ for $n \\geq 3$.\n\nSo $a_{2020} = 2019!$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Testing small values of k, we find that k=4 is the smallest where a difference is divisible by k (specifically 3^2 - 1^0 = 8 is divisible by 4). Thus s = k-1 = 3. For Problem 2: Starting with a_1=1, a_2=1 and requiring each term to be divisible by the previous term and the sum of two previous terms, we get the sequence 1,1,2,6,24,120,... which follows the pattern a_n = (n-1)! for n≥3. Therefore a_2020 = 2019!\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"2019!\"\n        }",
