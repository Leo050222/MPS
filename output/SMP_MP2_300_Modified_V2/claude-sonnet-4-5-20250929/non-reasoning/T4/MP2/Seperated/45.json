We need to place 2 red cubes among them such that red is visible on exactly 4 faces.\n\nFirst, let me classify the positions:\n- 8 corner cubes (visible on 3 faces each)\n- 12 edge cubes (visible on 2 faces each)\n- 6 face center cubes (visible on 1 face each)\n- 1 center cube (visible on 0 faces)\n\nFor red to be visible on exactly 4 faces, I need to count which faces show red.\n\nLet me think systematically about placing 2 red cubes:\n\n**Case 1: Both red cubes are corners**\nEach corner is on 3 faces. Two corners can share 0, 1, or 2 faces.\n- Share 0 faces: 4 faces total (not possible - corners always share at least 0 faces, but we need exactly 4)\n- Share 2 faces (edge-adjacent corners): 3 + 3 - 2 = 4 faces ✓\n\nEdge-adjacent corners: There are 12 edges, each with 2 corners, giving 12 pairs.\n\n**Case 2: Both red cubes are edge cubes**\nEach edge cube is on 2 faces. Two edge cubes can share 0, 1, or 2 faces.\n- Share 0 faces: 2 + 2 = 4 faces ✓\n- Share 1 face: 2 + 2 - 1 = 3 faces ✗\n- Share 2 faces (same edge): 2 faces ✗\n\nFor 0 shared faces: edges on opposite faces or perpendicular faces with no common face.\nCount pairs of edges sharing 0 faces: Total edge pairs = C(12,2) = 66\nPairs sharing 1 face: Each face has 4 edges, giving C(4,2) = 6 pairs per face, so 6×6 = 36 pairs\nPairs sharing 2 faces (same edge): 0 pairs (impossible)\nPairs sharing 0 faces: 66 - 36 = 30 pairs\n\n**Case 3: One corner, one edge**\nCorner on 3 faces, edge on 2 faces.\n- Share 0 faces: 3 + 2 = 5 faces ✗\n- Share 1 face: 3 + 2 - 1 = 4 faces ✓\n- Share 2 faces: 3 + 2 - 2 = 3 faces ✗\n\nEach corner is on 3 faces. Each face has 4 edges. For each corner, count edges sharing exactly 1 face with it.\nEach corner has 3 adjacent edges (sharing 2 faces) and other edges.\nEdges sharing exactly 1 face with a corner: 3 faces × 4 edges per face - 3 adjacent edges = 12 - 3 = 9 edges\nTotal: 8 corners × 9 edges = 72 pairs\n\n**Case 4: Other combinations** (face centers, center cube)\nThese won't give exactly 4 faces.\n\nTotal: 12 + 30 + 72 = 114\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, using the constraint that no elements belong to exactly two sets means x = y = z = 0, giving m = 2.
