But as $n$ grows, this becomes increasingly restrictive. The condition essentially forces $n$ to be very small.\n\nAfter analysis, the values are: $n \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 13\\}$.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I found that n=6 is the solution, which has k=2 distinct prime factors (2 and 3), giving e=1.
