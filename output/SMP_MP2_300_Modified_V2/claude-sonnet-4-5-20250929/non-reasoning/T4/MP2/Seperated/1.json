For $T_5(30)$:\n- We divide 30 vertices into 5 parts\n- Each part has $\\lfloor 30/5 \\rfloor = 6$ vertices\n- Since $30 = 5 \\times 6$, all parts have exactly 6 vertices\n\nThe number of edges in $T_5(30)$ is:\n$$t_5(30) = \\binom{30}{2} - 5\\binom{6}{2}$$\n\nThis is because we take all possible edges and subtract the edges within each of the 5 parts.\n\n$$t_5(30) = \\frac{30 \\times 29}{2} - 5 \\times \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2}$$\n$$= 435 - 5 \\times 15$$\n$$= 435 - 75$$\n$$= 360$$\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n$$t_{r-1}(n) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r-1}\\right)\\frac{n^2}{2} - \\text{correction term}$$\n\nFor exact calculation:\n$$t_5(30) = \\frac{(5-1) \\times 30^2}{2 \\times 5} = \\frac{4 \\times 900}{10} = \\frac{3600}{10} = 360$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$d = 360 + 1644 = 2004$$\n\n## Problem 2\n\nWe need to solve: $2003^x + 2004^x = 2005^x$\n\nDividing both sides by $2005^x$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{2003}{2005}\\right)^x + \\left(\\frac{2004}{2005}\\right)^x = 1$$\n\nLet $a = \\frac{2003}{2005} < 1$ and $b = \\frac{2004}{2005} < 1$.\n\nDefine $f(x) = a^x + b^x$.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- When $x = 0$: $f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2 > 1$\n- As $x \\to \\infty$: $f(x) \\to 0$ (since $a, b < 1$)\n- As $x \\to -\\infty$: $f(x) \\to \\infty$ (since $a^x, b^x \\to \\infty$)\n\n**Derivative:**\n$$f'(x) = a^x \\ln(a) + b^x \\ln(b)$$\n\nSince $a, b < 1$, we have $\\ln(a) < 0$ and $\\ln(b) < 0$.\n\nTherefore, $f'(x) < 0$ for all $x$, meaning $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is continuous and strictly decreasing:\n- $f(0) = 2 > 1$\n- $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = 0 < 1$\n\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists exactly one value of $x$ where $f(x) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the equation has exactly **1** real solution.\n\nWe can verify this solution is positive: since $f(0) = 2 > 1$ and $f$ is decreasing, the solution must occur at some $x > 0$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Using Turán's theorem, ex(30, K_6) equals the number of edges in the Turán graph T_5(30), which is a complete 5-partite graph with 6 vertices in each part. This gives 360 edges. Therefore d = 360 + 1644 = 2004. For Problem 2: Dividing by 2005^x gives (2003/2005)^x + (2004/2005)^x = 1. The function f(x) = a^x + b^x where a,b < 1 is strictly decreasing (negative derivative), starts at f(0) = 2 and approaches 0 as x approaches infinity.
