  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Finding pairs of polynomials P(x) and Q(x)\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the divisibility conditions**\n\nGiven:\n- P(x) divides Q(x)² + 1\n- Q(x) divides P(x)² + 1\n- Both have leading coefficient 1\n\nThis means:\n- Q(x)² + 1 = P(x)·R(x) for some polynomial R(x)\n- P(x)² + 1 = Q(x)·S(x) for some polynomial S(x)\n\n**Step 2: Degree analysis**\n\nLet deg(P) = m and deg(Q) = n.\n\nFrom the first condition: 2n = m + deg(R)\nFrom the second condition: 2m = n + deg(S)\n\nAdding these: 2n + 2m = m + n + deg(R) + deg(S)\nSo: m + n = deg(R) + deg(S)\n\n**Step 3: Consider the product**\n\nMultiplying the two divisibility conditions:\n(Q² + 1)(P² + 1) = P·R·Q·S\n\nExpanding: P²Q² + P² + Q² + 1 = PQ·RS\n\nThis gives: P² + Q² + 1 = PQ·RS - P²Q²\n\n**Step 4: Find specific solutions**\n\nLet's try constant polynomials first. If P(x) = a and Q(x) = b (constants):\n- P divides Q² + 1 means a divides b² + 1\n- Q divides P² + 1 means b divides a² + 1\n\nFor a = b = 1: 1 divides 2 (not satisfied)\nFor a = b = i: i divides -1 + 1 = 0 ✓\n\nActually, let's reconsider. If P and Q are monic polynomials of degree 0, then P = Q = 1.\n- Does 1 divide 1² + 1 = 2? Yes (as polynomials, any nonzero constant divides any polynomial)\n- Does 1 divide 1² + 1 = 2? Yes\n\nFor P = Q = 1: P² + Q² + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 and PQ = 1\nSo T = 3.\n\n**Step 5: Check for higher degree solutions**\n\nFrom symmetry and the constraints, if (P,Q) is a solution, we need:\n- deg(P) = deg(Q) for the system to be consistent\n\nLet's verify P = Q = x works:\n- Does x divide x² + 1? No, since x² + 1 has remainder 1 when divided by x.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the main solution is P = Q = 1 (constant polynomials).\n\nFor this case: P² + Q² + 1 = 3 = PQ·T\nSo: 3 = 1·T, giving T = 3\n\nTherefore: k = T + 14 = 3 + 14 = 17\n\n## Problem 2: Maximum number of problems\n\n**Step 1: Model the problem**\n\n- 16 students\n- Each problem has 4 choices\n- Any two students have at most 1 answer in common\n\nWe can represent each student's answers as a sequence. If there are n problems, each student has a sequence of length n where each entry is from {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\n**Step 2: Apply combinatorial constraints**\n\nFor any two students to have at most 1 answer in common, their answer sequences must differ in at least n-1 positions.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum size of a code where:\n- Codeword length = n\n- Alphabet size = 4\n- Minimum distance = n-1 (meaning at most 1 position agrees)\n\n**Step 3: Use the Singleton bound**\n\nFor a code with minimum distance d = n-1, we need codewords that agree in at most 1 position.\n\nConsider: if we have 16 students and n problems, we need 16 distinct sequences such that any two agree in at most 1 position.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate maximum n**\n\nIf two sequences agree in at most 1 position out of n, then for each pair of students, there are at most n positions where they could agree, and they agree in exactly 0 or 1.\n\nUsing a counting argument: The number of pairs of students is C(16,2) = 120.\n\nFor n problems with 4 choices each, if we want any two students to agree on at most 1 problem, we can use the fact that this is related to a combinatorial design.\n\nBy the generalized Singleton bound and construction: n ≤ 5.\n\nWe can verify n = 5 is achievable using a construction based on affine planes or direct construction.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of problems is **5**.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Analyzing the divisibility conditions P(x)|Q(x)²+1 and Q(x)|P(x)²+1 with both monic polynomials, the main solution is P=Q=1 (constant polynomials). This gives P²+Q²+1=3=PQ·T, so T=3 and k=T+14=17. For Problem 2: With 16 students, 4 choices per problem, and any two students having at most 1 answer in common, this is a coding theory problem. Using combinatorial bounds and the constraint that answer sequences must differ in all but at most 1 position, the maximum number of problems is 5.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"17\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"5\"\n        }",
