  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nWe need to find positive integers $N$ that can be expressed as the sum of $k=2017$ consecutive positive integers, but for no other value of $k>1$.\n\nThe sum of $k$ consecutive integers starting from $a$ is:\n$$N = a + (a+1) + \\cdots + (a+k-1) = ka + \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} = k\\left(a + \\frac{k-1}{2}\\right)$$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$N = \\frac{k(2a+k-1)}{2}$$\n\nFor this to work with positive integer $a$:\n- We need $2a + k - 1 > 0$, so $a > \\frac{1-k}{2}$\n- Since $a \\geq 1$, we need $2a + k - 1 \\geq k + 1$\n\nFrom $N = \\frac{k(2a+k-1)}{2}$, we get:\n$$2N = k(2a+k-1)$$\n\nFor $N$ to be expressible with exactly $k=2017$ consecutive integers and no other $k>1$:\n\nSince $2017$ is prime, and $N = \\frac{2017(2a+2016)}{2} = 2017 \\cdot \\frac{2a+2016}{2}$\n\nFor $k=2017$ (odd prime), we need $2a + 2016$ to be even, which it always is.\nSo $N = 2017(a + 1008)$.\n\nFor $N$ to NOT be expressible with other values of $k>1$:\n- If $k$ is odd and $k|N$, then $N = k \\cdot m$ where $m = a + \\frac{k-1}{2}$ must be a positive integer\n- If $k$ is even and $k|2N$, similar conditions apply\n\nFor $N = 2017(a+1008)$ to only work with $k=2017$:\n- $N$ must not be divisible by any odd number except 1 and 2017\n- $2N = 2 \\cdot 2017(a+1008)$ must not allow other factorizations\n\nThis means $a + 1008$ must be a power of 2. Let $a + 1008 = 2^m$.\n\nThe smallest positive $a$ occurs when $2^m$ is smallest while still giving $a \\geq 1$.\n- If $m = 0$: $a + 1008 = 1$, so $a = -1007$ (negative, invalid)\n- If $m = 1$: $a + 1008 = 2$, so $a = -1006$ (negative, invalid)\n- ...\n- If $m = 10$: $a + 1008 = 1024$, so $a = 16$\n- If $m = 11$: $a + 1008 = 2048$, so $a = 1040$\n\nSo the smallest positive $a$ is $16$.\n\nTherefore, $m = a - 13 = 16 - 13 = 3$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nWe need to count the number of ways to tile a $3 \\times 8$ rectangle with $1 \\times 2$ dominoes.\n\nLet $a_n$ be the number of ways to tile a $3 \\times n$ rectangle.\n\nUsing dynamic programming with states based on the rightmost column configuration:\n- State 0: All cells in the column are covered by previous tiles\n- State 1: Top cell needs to be filled\n- State 2: Middle cell needs to be filled  \n- State 3: Top and middle cells need to be filled\n- State 4: Bottom cell needs to be filled\n- State 5: Top and bottom cells need to be filled\n- State 6: Middle and bottom cells need to be filled\n- State 7: All three cells need to be filled\n\nThe recurrence relation for $a_n$ (starting with empty column) is:\n$$a_n = a_{n-2} + 4a_{n-1}$$\n\nWith initial conditions:\n- $a_0 = 1$ (empty rectangle)\n- $a_1 = 0$ (can't tile $3 \\times 1$)\n- $a_2 = 3$\n\nComputing:\n- $a_2 = 3$\n- $a_3 = 0$\n- $a_4 = 3 + 4(3) = 11$\n- $a_5 = 0$\n- $a_6 = 11 + 4(11) = 55$\n- $a_7 = 0$\n- $a_8 = 55 + 4(55) = 153$\n\nWait, let me recalculate more carefully. For $3 \\times n$ rectangles:\n- $a_2 = 3$\n- $a_4 = 11$\n- $a_6 = 41$\n- $a_8 = 153$\n\nActually, using the standard recurrence $a_n = 4a_{n-2} - a_{n-4}$:\n- $a_2 = 3$\n- $a_4 = 11$\n- $a_6 = 4(11) - 3 = 41$\n- $a_8 = 4(41) - 11 = 164 - 11 = 153$\n\nThe answer is $153$.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: N must equal 2017(a+1008) and only be expressible with k=2017. This requires a+1008 to be a power of 2. The smallest positive a is 16 when a+1008=1024=2^10. Thus m=a-13=3. For Problem 2: Using the recurrence relation a_n = 4a_{n-2} - a_{n-4} for tiling 3×n rectangles with a_2=3, a_4=11, we get a_6=41 and a_8=153.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"153\"\n}\n```",
