      "A390": "Two players, $B$ and $R$ , play the following game on an infinite grid of unit squares, all initially colored white. The players take turns starting with $B$ . On $B$ 's turn, $B$ selects one white unit square and colors it blue. On $R$ 's turn, $R$ selects two white unit squares and colors them red. The players alternate until $B$ decides to end the game. At this point, $B$ gets a score, given by the number of unit squares in the largest (in terms of area) simple polygon containing only blue unit squares. What is the largest score $B$ can guarantee?\n(A simple polygon is a polygon (not necessarily convex) that does not intersect itself and has no holes.) Instead of determining the largest score $B$ can guarantee, simply find $m = |P_i| - 2$, where $|P_i|$ is the number of unit squares in each of the disjoint $2 \\times 2$ blocks into which the grid is partitioned to analyze the connectivity of blue squares."

  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1 Analysis\n\nThis problem asks about a game where player B colors squares blue and player R colors squares red. The problem statement seems to have been modified to ask for a specific value related to partitioning the grid into 2×2 blocks.\n\nLet me analyze the strategic aspects:\n- B colors 1 square per turn\n- R colors 2 squares per turn\n- B wants to maximize the area of the largest simple polygon containing only blue squares\n- R wants to minimize this\n\nThe key insight is that R can use a blocking strategy. For every blue square B places, R can place 2 red squares to limit B's ability to form large connected regions.\n\nThe problem asks for m = |P_i| - 2, where |P_i| is related to 2×2 blocks. In the context of this game, if we partition the infinite grid into disjoint 2×2 blocks, B can guarantee at most one blue square per block before R can block the rest.\n\nHowever, B can guarantee getting all 4 squares in one 2×2 block:\n- Turn 1: B colors 1 square in a 2×2 block\n- Turn 1: R colors 2 squares (elsewhere or in other blocks)\n- Turn 2: B colors another square in the same block\n- Turn 2: R colors 2 squares\n- Turn 3: B colors the third square in the block\n- Turn 3: R colors 2 squares\n- Turn 4: B colors the fourth square and ends the game\n\nSo B can guarantee a 2×2 block with 4 blue squares.\nTherefore, |P_i| = 4, and m = 4 - 2 = 2.\n\n## Problem 2 Analysis\n\nWe need to find all positive integers x, y, z such that:\n- z + y² + x³ = xyz\n- x = gcd(y, z)\n\nSince x = gcd(y, z), we can write:\n- y = xa for some positive integer a\n- z = xb for some positive integer b\n- gcd(a, b) = 1\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\nxb + (xa)² + x³ = x · xa · xb\nxb + x²a² + x³ = x³ab\n\nDividing by x:\nb + xa² + x² = x²ab\n\nRearranging:\nb + xa² + x² = x²ab\nb(1 - x²a) = -xa² - x²\nb(x²a - 1) = xa² + x²\nb(x²a - 1) = x(a² + x)\n\nFor this to have positive integer solutions:\nb = x(a² + x)/(x²a - 1)\n\nFor b to be a positive integer, we need x²a - 1 > 0 and (x²a - 1) | x(a² + x).\n\nLet's try small values:\n\n**Case x = 1:**\nb(a - 1) = a² + 1\nIf a = 2: b(1) = 5, so b = 5\nCheck: z + y² + x³ = 5 + 4 + 1 = 10, xyz = 1·2·5 = 10 ✓\nSolution: (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 5)\n\nIf a = 3: b(2) = 10, so b = 5\nCheck: z + y² + x³ = 3 + 9 + 1 = 13, xyz = 1·3·3 = 9 ✗\n\n**Case x = 2:**\nb(4a - 1) = 2(a² + 2)\nIf a = 1: b(3) = 6, so b = 2\nCheck: gcd(1, 2) = 1 ✓\nz + y² + x³ = 4 + 4 + 8 = 16, xyz = 2·2·4 = 16 ✓\nSolution: (x, y, z) = (2, 2, 4)\n\nAfter checking other cases systematically, these are the only solutions.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, B can guarantee filling a 2×2 block with 4 blue squares by focusing on one block over 4 turns. Since |P_i| = 4, we have m = 4 - 2 = 2. For Problem 2, using the substitution y = xa and z = xb with gcd(a,b) = 1, we get b(x²a - 1) = x(a² + x).
