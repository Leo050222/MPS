  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer $a > 1$ such that there exists a positive integer $b$ satisfying $4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1$, then calculate $d = a - 14$.\n\nThis is a Pell equation. Rearranging: $4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1$.\n\nLet me rewrite this as $(2b)^2 - 3a^2 = 1$.\n\nSetting $x = 2b$, we get $x^2 - 3a^2 = 1$.\n\nThis is the Pell equation $x^2 - 3y^2 = 1$ where $y = a$.\n\nThe fundamental solution to $x^2 - 3y^2 = 1$ is $(x_1, y_1) = (2, 1)$.\n\nWe can verify: $2^2 - 3(1)^2 = 4 - 3 = 1$ ✓\n\nThe general solutions are generated by:\n$(x_n + y_n\\sqrt{3}) = (2 + \\sqrt{3})^n$\n\nFor $n = 1$: $(x, y) = (2, 1)$, so $a = 1$ (but we need $a > 1$)\n\nFor $n = 2$: $(2 + \\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 + 4\\sqrt{3} + 3 = 7 + 4\\sqrt{3}$\nSo $(x, y) = (7, 4)$, giving $a = 4$\n\nLet's verify: $x = 7 = 2b$, so $b = 3.5$ (not an integer!)\n\nWait, I need to reconsider. The equation is $4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1$.\n\nLet me check small values directly:\n- $a = 2$: $4b^2 = 1 + 12 = 13$ (not a perfect square)\n- $a = 3$: $4b^2 = 1 + 27 = 28$ (not a perfect square)\n- $a = 4$: $4b^2 = 1 + 48 = 49$, so $b^2 = 49/4$ (not an integer)\n- $a = 5$: $4b^2 = 1 + 75 = 76$ (not a perfect square)\n- ...continuing...\n- $a = 15$: $4b^2 = 1 + 675 = 676 = 4 \\times 169$, so $b^2 = 169$, $b = 13$ ✓\n\nLet's verify: $4(13)^2 - 3(15)^2 = 676 - 675 = 1$ ✓\n\nTherefore, $a = 15$ and $d = 15 - 14 = 1$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nGiven: $z^5 + 2004z = 1$\n\nWe need to find a polynomial $P$ of degree 5 such that $P(z^2) = 0$.\n\nFrom $z^5 + 2004z = 1$, we get $z^5 = 1 - 2004z$.\n\nLet $w = z^2$. Then $z = \\pm\\sqrt{w}$.\n\nWe have: $z^5 = z^4 \\cdot z = w^2 \\cdot z$\n\nSo: $w^2 z = 1 - 2004z$\nThus: $z(w^2 + 2004) = 1$\nTherefore: $z = \\frac{1}{w^2 + 2004}$\n\nSince $w = z^2$:\n$w = \\frac{1}{(w^2 + 2004)^2}$\n\nThis gives us: $w(w^2 + 2004)^2 = 1$\n\nExpanding: $w(w^4 + 4008w^2 + 2004^2) = 1$\n$w^5 + 4008w^3 + 4016016w = 1$\n\nTherefore: $P(w) = w^5 + 4008w^3 + 4016016w - 1$\n\nNow we calculate:\n$P(1) = 1 + 4008 + 4016016 - 1 = 4020024$\n$P(-1) = -1 - 4008 - 4016016 - 1 = -4020026$\n\nTherefore: $\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \\frac{4020024}{-4020026} = -\\frac{4020024}{4020026} = -\\frac{2010012}{2010013}$\n\nLet me verify this is in lowest terms. Since these differ by 1, they are coprime.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I solved the Pell equation 4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1 by testing values and found a = 15, b = 13 is the smallest solution with a > 1, giving d = 15 - 14 = 1. For Problem 2, from z^5 + 2004z = 1, I derived that w = z^2 satisfies w^5 + 4008w^3 + 4016016w - 1 = 0, so P(w) = w^5 + 4008w^3 + 4016016w - 1.
