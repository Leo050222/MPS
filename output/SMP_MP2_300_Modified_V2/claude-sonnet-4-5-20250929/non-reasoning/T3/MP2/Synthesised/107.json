Suppose $x^{(k + 2)}-a x^{(k + 1)}+b x-(k + 47)$ is a polynomial with three positive roots $p, q$, and $r$ such that $p<q<r$. What is the minimum possible value of $k / p+2 / q+3 / r$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Find the integer solutions to $m^5 - n^5 = 16mn$\n\nFirst, let me find pairs $(m,n)$ of integers satisfying $m^5 - n^5 = 16mn$.\n\nLet me try small values:\n- If $m = 0$: $-n^5 = 0$, so $n = 0$. This gives $(0,0)$.\n- If $n = 0$: $m^5 = 0$, so $m = 0$. Same solution.\n\nFor opposite signs, let's try $m = 2, n = -2$:\n$2^5 - (-2)^5 = 32 + 32 = 64$\n$16(2)(-2) = -64$\nNot equal.\n\nLet me try $m = -2, n = 2$:\n$(-2)^5 - 2^5 = -32 - 32 = -64$\n$16(-2)(2) = -64$ ✓\n\nSo $(m,n) = (-2, 2)$ is a solution with opposite signs where $n = 2$ is positive.\n\nLet me verify there are no other small solutions by checking a few more values systematically.\n\nFor $m = 2, n = 1$: $32 - 1 = 31$ vs $16(2)(1) = 32$. Close but not equal.\n\nAfter checking, the main solution with opposite signs and positive $n$ is $(m,n) = (-2, 2)$.\n\n## Step 2: Find $k = n - 1$\n\nWith $n = 2$, we have:\n$$k = n - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$$\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the polynomial\n\nThe polynomial is:\n$$x^{k+2} - ax^{k+1} + bx - (k+47)$$\n\nWith $k = 1$:\n$$x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48$$\n\nThis has three positive roots $p, q, r$ with $p < q < r$.\n\nBy Vieta's formulas:\n- $p + q + r = a$\n- $pq + pr + qr = b$\n- $pqr = 48$\n\n## Step 4: Minimize $\\frac{k}{p} + \\frac{2}{q} + \\frac{3}{r} = \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{2}{q} + \\frac{3}{r}$\n\nWe need to minimize $f(p,q,r) = \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{2}{q} + \\frac{3}{r}$ subject to $pqr = 48$.\n\nUsing Lagrange multipliers or AM-GM inequality:\n\nBy weighted AM-GM:\n$$\\frac{1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{p} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{q} + 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{r}}{1+2+3} \\geq \\sqrt[6]{\\frac{1}{p} \\cdot \\frac{1}{q^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{r^3}}$$\n\nFor minimum, we want equality conditions. By calculus or weighted AM-GM, the minimum occurs when:\n$$\\frac{1}{p} : \\frac{2}{q} : \\frac{3}{r} = 1:1:1$$\n\nThis gives: $\\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{2}{q} = \\frac{3}{r}$\n\nSo $q = 2p$ and $r = 3p$.\n\nFrom $pqr = 48$:\n$$p \\cdot 2p \\cdot 3p = 48$$\n$$6p^3 = 48$$\n$$p^3 = 8$$\n$$p = 2$$\n\nTherefore: $p = 2, q = 4, r = 6$\n\nThe minimum value is:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found integer solutions to m^5 - n^5 = 16mn. Testing values, I found (m,n) = (-2,2) is a solution with opposite signs where n=2 is positive. Thus k = n-1 = 1. The polynomial becomes x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48 with three positive roots p,q,r where pqr = 48. To minimize 1/p + 2/q + 3/r subject to pqr = 48, I used the condition that the minimum occurs when the weighted terms are equal: 1/p = 2/q = 3/r. This gives q = 2p and r = 3p. Substituting into pqr = 48 gives 6p^3 = 48, so p = 2, q = 4, r = 6. The minimum value is 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/6 = 3/2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3/2\"\n}",
