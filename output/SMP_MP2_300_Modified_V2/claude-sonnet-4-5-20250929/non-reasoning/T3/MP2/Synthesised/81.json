  "math_problem": "Find two lines of symmetry of the graph of the function $y=x+\\frac{1}{x}$. Express your answer as two equations of the form $y=a x+b$. Instead of determining the equations of the lines of symmetry, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote parallel to the y-axis, derived from the asymptotic analysis of the curve. Determine all triplets of real numbers $(x, y, z)$ satisfying the system of equations $x^{2} y+y^{2} z =k+1039$, $x^{2} z+z^{2} y =260$, $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) =-540$.",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Find k from the asymptotic analysis\n\nThe function is $y = x + \\frac{1}{x}$.\n\nFor asymptotic analysis, as $x \\to 0$, the term $\\frac{1}{x}$ dominates, so the curve has a vertical asymptote at $x = 0$.\n\nThe equation of this asymptote is $x = 0$, which can be written as $0 \\cdot x + 0 \\cdot y = 0$ or simply $x = 0$.\n\nIn the form of a general line equation $ax + by + c = 0$, this is $1 \\cdot x + 0 \\cdot y + 0 = 0$.\n\nThe coefficient vector is $(1, 0)$ (considering coefficients of $x$ and $y$).\n\nThe Euclidean norm is: $k = \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 1$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the system of equations with k = 1\n\nThe system is:\n- $x^2 y + y^2 z = k + 1039 = 1 + 1039 = 1040$\n- $x^2 z + z^2 y = 260$\n- $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) = -540$\n\nLet me denote:\n- Equation (1): $x^2 y + y^2 z = 1040$\n- Equation (2): $x^2 z + z^2 y = 260$\n- Equation (3): $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) = -540$\n\nFrom equations (1) and (2):\n- $y(x^2 + yz) = 1040$\n- $z(x^2 + yz) = 260$\n\nDividing: $\\frac{y}{z} = \\frac{1040}{260} = 4$\n\nSo $y = 4z$.\n\nSubstituting into equation (2):\n$x^2 z + z^2(4z) = 260$\n$x^2 z + 4z^3 = 260$\n$z(x^2 + 4z^2) = 260$\n\nSubstituting $y = 4z$ into equation (1):\n$x^2(4z) + (4z)^2 z = 1040$\n$4x^2 z + 16z^3 = 1040$\n$4z(x^2 + 4z^2) = 1040$\n$z(x^2 + 4z^2) = 260$\n\nThis confirms our relation.\n\nNow using equation (3) with $y = 4z$:\n$(x - 4z)(4z - z)(z - x) = -540$\n$(x - 4z)(3z)(z - x) = -540$\n$3z(x - 4z)(z - x) = -540$\n$z(x - 4z)(z - x) = -180$\n$z[(x - 4z)(z - x)] = -180$\n$z[xz - x^2 - 4z^2 + 4xz] = -180$\n$z[5xz - x^2 - 4z^2] = -180$\n$5xz^2 - x^2z - 4z^3 = -180$\n\nFrom $z(x^2 + 4z^2) = 260$, we have $x^2z + 4z^3 = 260$.\n\nSo: $5xz^2 - 260 = -180$\n$5xz^2 = 80$\n$xz^2 = 16$\n$x = \\frac{16}{z^2}$\n\nSubstituting back into $x^2z + 4z^3 = 260$:\n$\\frac{256}{z^4} \\cdot z + 4z^3 = 260$\n$\\frac{256}{z^3} + 4z^3 = 260$\n$256 + 4z^6 = 260z^3$\n$4z^6 - 260z^3 + 256 = 0$\n$z^6 - 65z^3 + 64 = 0$\n\nLet $u = z^3$:\n$u^2 - 65u + 64 = 0$\n$u = \\frac{65 \\pm \\sqrt{4225 - 256}}{2} = \\frac{65 \\pm \\sqrt{3969}}{2} = \\frac{65 \\pm 63}{2}$\n\nSo $u = 64$ or $u = 1$.\n\nTherefore $z^3 = 64$ giving $z = 4$, or $z^3 = 1$ giving $z = 1$.\n\nFor $z = 4$: $x = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$, $y = 16$. Triplet: $(1, 16, 4)$\nFor $z = 1$: $x = \\frac{16}{1} = 16$, $y = 4$. Triplet: $(16, 4, 1)$\n\nVerification shows both work. The triplets are $(1, 16, 4)$ and $(16, 4, 1)$.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found k by analyzing the asymptote of y = x + 1/x. The vertical asymptote is x = 0, with coefficient vector (1,0), giving k = 1. Then I solved the system with k = 1, finding y = 4z from the first two equations. Substituting into the third equation and solving the resulting polynomial gave z = 4 or z = 1, leading to two triplets: (1, 16, 4) and (16, 4, 1).\",\n    \"answer\": \"(1, 16, 4) and (16, 4, 1)\"\n}",
