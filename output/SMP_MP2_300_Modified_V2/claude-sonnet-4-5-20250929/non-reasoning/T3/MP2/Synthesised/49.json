  "math_problem": "How many ways, without taking order into consideration, can 2002 be expressed as the sum of 3 positive integers (for instance, $1000+1000+2$ and $1000+2+1000$ are considered to be the same way)? Instead of determining the total number of unordered triples of positive integers that sum to the given total, simply find $l$, the terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends. Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer with exactly $(l + 2012)$ positive factors. What is the sum of the (not necessarily distinct) prime factors of $n$?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the problem\n\nWe need to find the number of ways to express 2002 as the sum of 3 positive integers without considering order. This is equivalent to finding unordered triples $(a, b, c)$ where $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a + b + c = 2002$.\n\n## Step 2: Setting up the counting\n\nFor unordered triples with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a + b + c = 2002$:\n- We have $a \\leq b \\leq c$\n- Since $a + b + c = 2002$ and $a \\leq b \\leq c$, we get $3a \\leq 2002$, so $a \\leq 667.33...$, meaning $a \\leq 667$\n\nFor a fixed value of $a$, we need $b + c = 2002 - a$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n\n## Step 3: Finding constraints on $b$\n\nGiven $a$ and $b + c = 2002 - a$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$:\n- From $b \\leq c$ and $b + c = 2002 - a$, we get $2b \\leq 2002 - a$, so $b \\leq \\frac{2002-a}{2}$\n- From $a \\leq b$, we get $b \\geq a$\n\nSo for fixed $a$: $a \\leq b \\leq \\frac{2002-a}{2}$\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing the case structure\n\nThe number of valid values of $b$ for a given $a$ is:\n$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2002-a}{2} \\right\\rfloor - a + 1$$\n\nWhen $2002 - a$ is even: $\\frac{2002-a}{2} - a + 1 = \\frac{2002-3a}{2} + 1 = \\frac{2004-3a}{2}$\n\nWhen $2002 - a$ is odd: $\\frac{2001-a}{2} - a + 1 = \\frac{2003-3a}{2}$\n\nSince 2002 is even:\n- If $a$ is even, then $2002 - a$ is even\n- If $a$ is odd, then $2002 - a$ is odd\n\n## Step 5: Finding the arithmetic sequences\n\nFor even $a = 2, 4, 6, ..., 666$:\nNumber of $b$ values = $\\frac{2004-3a}{2} = 1002 - \\frac{3a}{2}$\n\nThis gives us: $1001, 998, 995, ...$\n\nThe sequence starts at $a=2$: $1002 - 3 = 999$\nThe sequence ends when $a = 666$: $1002 - 999 = 3$\n\nWait, let me recalculate. For $a = 2$: $\\frac{2004-6}{2} = 999$\nFor $a = 666$: $\\frac{2004-1998}{2} = 3$\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence: $999, 996, 993, ..., 3$ with common difference $-3$.\n\nFor odd $a = 1, 3, 5, ..., 667$:\nNumber of $b$ values = $\\frac{2003-3a}{2}$\n\nFor $a = 1$: $\\frac{2003-3}{2} = 1000$\nFor $a = 667$: $\\frac{2003-2001}{2} = 1$\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence: $1000, 997, 994, ..., 1$ with common difference $-3$.\n\n## Step 6: Identifying the shorter sequence\n\nThe even sequence goes from 999 to 3 (333 terms)\nThe odd sequence goes from 1000 to 1 (334 terms)\n\nThe shorter sequence is the even one, with terminal term $l = 3$.\n\n## Step 7: Finding $n$\n\nWe need the smallest positive integer $n$ with exactly $l + 2012 = 3 + 2012 = 2015$ positive divisors.\n\nFirst, factor 2015: $2015 = 5 \\times 403 = 5 \\times 13 \\times 31$\n\nFor $n = p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, the number of divisors is $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)\\cdots(a_k+1) = 2015 = 5 \\times 13 \\times 31$\n\nTo minimize $n$, we assign the largest exponents to the smallest primes:\n- $2015 = 2015$: $n = 2^{2014}$\n- $2015 = 5 \\times 403$: $n = 2^{402} \\times 3^4$ or $n = 2^4 \\times 3^{402}$\n- $2015 = 13 \\times 155$: $n = 2^{154} \\times 3^{12}$ or $n = 2^{12} \\times 3^{154}$\n- $2015 = 31 \\times 65$: $n = 2^{64} \\times 3^{30}$ or $n = 2^{30} \\times 3^{64}$\n- $2015 = 5 \\times 13 \\times 31$: $n = 2^{30} \\times 3^{12} \\times 5^4$\n\nThe smallest is $n = 2^{30} \\times 3^{12} \\times 5^4$.\n\n## Step 8: Sum of prime factors\n\nThe prime factors are 2, 3, and 5.\nSum = $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$\n\n{  \n            \"reasoning\": \"The problem asks for l (terminal term of shorter arithmetic sequence) which is 3, then n with exactly 2015 divisors.
