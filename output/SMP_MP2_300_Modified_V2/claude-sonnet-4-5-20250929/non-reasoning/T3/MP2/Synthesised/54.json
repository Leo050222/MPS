  "math_problem": "Let $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ be a strictly increasing function such that $f(1)=1$ and $f(2n)f(2n+1)=9f(n)^{2}+3f(n)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Compute $f(137)$. Instead of computing the value of the function at the specified argument, simply find $k = f(68) - 730$, where $f(68)$ is the intermediate value of the function obtained by applying the recursive relation to reach the target argument. How many ways can the $k$ vertices of a three-dimensional cube be colored red and blue such that no two points connected by an edge are both red? Rotations and reflections of a given coloring are considered distinct.",

The total number of valid colorings is $2^8 = 256$ minus invalid ones, but we need independent sets.\n\nFor a cube: The number of independent sets is 35.\n\nSince we have 8 vertices and each can be red or blue, with the constraint that red vertices form an independent set, the answer is **35**.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I computed f(68) by recursively applying the given relation: f(68) = 738.
