  "math_problem": "A group of 101 Dalmathians participate in an election, where they each vote independently on either candidate $A$ or $B$ with equal probability. If $X$ Dalmathians voted for the winning candidate, the expected value of $X^{2}$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for positive integers $a, b$ with $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1$. Find the unique positive integer $k \\leq 103$ such that $103 \\mid a-bk$. Instead of determining the specified integer related to the expected value of the square of the number voting for the winning candidate, simply find $r = P(\\textrm{same}) + 3/2$, where $P(\\textrm{same})$ is the probability that two voters vote for the same candidate derived from the independence of their votes. Find all possible values of $\\frac{d}{a}$ where $a^{r}-6 a d+8 d^{2}=0, a \\neq 0$.",

Since each votes for A or B with probability 1/2, P(same) = 1/2. Then r = P(same) + 3/2 = 2. Substituting r = 2 into the equation a^r - 6ad + 8d² = 0 gives a² - 6ad + 8d² = 0. Dividing by a² and letting x = d/a yields 8x² - 6x + 1 = 0. Using the quadratic formula: x = (6 ± 2)/16, giving x = 1/2 or x = 1/4. Both solutions satisfy the original equation.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/2, 1/4\"\n}",
