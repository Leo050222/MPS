  "math_problem": "For how many positive integers $a$ does the polynomial $x^{2}-a x+a$ have an integer root? Instead of counting the positive integers $a$ such that the given quadratic polynomial has an integer root, simply find $k = a + 7$, where $a$ is a positive integer such that $x^{2} - a x + a$ has an integer root. Marisa has two identical cubical dice labeled with the numbers \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\). However, the two dice are not fair, meaning that they can land on each face with different probability. Marisa rolls the two dice and calculates their sum. Given that the sum is 2 with probability 0.04, and 12 with probability 0.01, the maximum possible probability of the sum being $k$ is $p$. Compute $\\lfloor (k + 93) p \\rfloor$.",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Part 1: Finding positive integers $a$ such that $x^2 - ax + a$ has an integer root\n\nLet $r$ be an integer root. Then:\n$$r^2 - ar + a = 0$$\n$$r^2 = ar - a = a(r-1)$$\n$$a = \\frac{r^2}{r-1}$$\n\nFor $a$ to be a positive integer, we need:\n1. $r \\neq 1$ (to avoid division by zero)\n2. $(r-1) | r^2$\n\nLet me rewrite: $r^2 = r(r-1) + r$, so:\n$$a = \\frac{r^2}{r-1} = \\frac{r(r-1) + r}{r-1} = r + \\frac{r}{r-1}$$\n\nFor $a$ to be an integer, we need $(r-1) | r$.\n\nSince $r = (r-1) + 1$, we have $(r-1) | r$ if and only if $(r-1) | 1$.\n\nThis means $r-1 \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$, so $r \\in \\{0, 2\\}$.\n\n- If $r = 0$: $a = \\frac{0}{-1} = 0$ (not positive)\n- If $r = 2$: $a = \\frac{4}{1} = 4$ (positive)\n\nWait, let me reconsider. We need $(r-1) | r^2$.\n\nSince $r^2 = (r-1)(r+1) + 1$, we need $(r-1) | 1$.\n\nSo $r-1 \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$, giving $r \\in \\{0, 2\\}$.\n\nFor $r = 2$: $a = 4$\n\nTherefore, $k = a + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11$.\n\n## Part 2: Dice probability problem\n\nLet $p_i$ be the probability of rolling $i$ on one die.\n\nGiven:\n- $P(\\text{sum} = 2) = p_1 \\cdot p_1 = p_1^2 = 0.04$, so $p_1 = 0.2$\n- $P(\\text{sum} = 12) = p_6 \\cdot p_6 = p_6^2 = 0.01$, so $p_6 = 0.1$\n\nWe have $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 = 1$, so:\n$$p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 1 - 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.7$$\n\nFor sum $k$, the probability is:\n$$P(\\text{sum} = k) = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} p_i \\cdot p_{k-i}$$\n\nwhere we only count valid pairs where both $i$ and $k-i$ are in $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.\n\nFor $k = 11$: $P(\\text{sum} = 11) = 2p_5 p_6 = 2p_5(0.1) = 0.2p_5$\n\nTo maximize this, we want to maximize $p_5$ subject to $p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 0.7$.\n\nThe maximum occurs when $p_5 = 0.7$ (and $p_2 = p_3 = p_4 = 0$).\n\nTherefore, maximum $P(\\text{sum} = 11) = 0.2 \\times 0.7 = 0.14$.\n\nSo $k = 11$ and $p = 0.14$.\n\nThe answer is:\n$$\\lfloor (k + 93)p \\rfloor = \\lfloor (11 + 93) \\times 0.14 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 104 \\times 0.14 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 14.56 \\rfloor = 14$$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found that for $x^2 - ax + a$ to have an integer root $r$, we need $a = r^2/(r-1)$. This requires $(r-1)|1$, giving $r \\in \\{0, 2\\}$. Only $r=2$ gives positive $a=4$, so $k = a+7 = 11$. For the dice problem, with $p_1 = 0.2$ and $p_6 = 0.1$, the sum $k=11$ has probability $2p_5p_6 = 0.2p_5$. Maximizing with $p_5 = 0.7$ gives $p = 0.14$. Therefore, $\\\\lfloor(11+93) \\\\times 0.14\\\\rfloor = \\\\lfloor 14.56 \\\\rfloor = 14$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"14\"\n}",
