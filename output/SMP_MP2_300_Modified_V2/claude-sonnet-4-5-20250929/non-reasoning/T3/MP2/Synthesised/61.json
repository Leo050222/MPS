  "math_problem": "You start with a single piece of chalk of length 1. Every second, you choose a piece of chalk that you have uniformly at random and break it in half. You continue this until you have 8 pieces of chalk. What is the probability that they all have length $\\frac{1}{8}$ ? Instead of determining the probability that the final pieces are all of equal length, simply find $e = \\binom{6}{3} - 16$, where $\\binom{6}{3}$ is the number of ways to interleave the remaining breaks equally between the two subpieces created by the first break. A complex quartic polynomial $Q$ is quirky if it has four distinct roots, one of which is the sum of the other three. There are four complex values of $k$ for which the polynomial $Q(x)=x^{e}-k x^{3}-x^{2}-x-(e + 41)$ is quirky. Compute the product of these four values of $k$.",

For a quirky polynomial with roots r,s,t,u where u = r+s+t, using Vieta's formulas and the constraint, I derived that u satisfies u^4 + u^2 + u + 45 = 0. Since k = 2u, and the product of the four u values is 45 (constant term divided by leading coefficient), the product of the four k values is 16 × 45 = 720.\",\n            \"answer\": \"720\"\n        }",
