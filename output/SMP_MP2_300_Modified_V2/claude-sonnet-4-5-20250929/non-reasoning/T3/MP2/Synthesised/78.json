  "math_problem": "Let $Q(x)=x^{2}+2x+3$, and suppose that $P(x)$ is a polynomial such that $P(Q(x))=x^{6}+6x^{5}+18x^{4}+32x^{3}+35x^{2}+22x+8$. Compute $P(2)$. Instead of computing $P(2)$, simply find $k = Q(r) - 1$, where $r$ is the unique real root of the derivative of $Q$.

  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Find the derivative of Q(x) and its root\n\nGiven $Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3$\n\nThe derivative is:\n$Q'(x) = 2x + 2$\n\nSetting $Q'(x) = 0$:\n$2x + 2 = 0$\n$x = -1$\n\nSo $r = -1$ is the unique real root of $Q'(x)$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate k = Q(r) - 1\n\n$Q(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2$\n\nTherefore:\n$k = Q(-1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the second question\n\nNow we need to determine if there exists an irrational number $\\alpha > k = 1$ such that:\n$\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\rfloor \\equiv (k-1) \\pmod{k+2016}$\n\nfor all integers $n \\geq k$.\n\nSubstituting $k = 1$:\n$\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$\n\nfor all integers $n \\geq 1$.\n\nThis means $\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\rfloor$ must be divisible by 2017 for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Check if such an α exists\n\nFor $n = 1$: $\\lfloor \\alpha \\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$\n\nThis means $\\lfloor \\alpha \\rfloor = 2017m$ for some non-negative integer $m$.\n\nSince $\\alpha > 1$, we need $\\lfloor \\alpha \\rfloor \\geq 1$, so the smallest possibility is $\\lfloor \\alpha \\rfloor = 2017$.\n\nThis means $2017 \\leq \\alpha < 2018$.\n\nFor $n = 2$: $\\lfloor \\alpha^2 \\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$\n\nIf $\\alpha \\in [2017, 2018)$, then:\n- Minimum: $\\alpha^2 \\geq 2017^2 = 4,068,289$\n- Maximum: $\\alpha^2 < 2018^2 = 4,072,324$\n\nSo $\\lfloor \\alpha^2 \\rfloor$ could range from $4,068,289$ to $4,072,323$.\n\nWe need $\\lfloor \\alpha^2 \\rfloor = 2017k$ for some integer $k$.\n\n$4,068,289 = 2017 \\times 2017 = 2017^2$ ✓\n\nFor this to work consistently for all $n$, we would need $\\alpha$ to be very special.\n\nHowever, as $n$ increases, $\\alpha^n$ grows exponentially. The constraint that $\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$ for ALL $n \\geq 1$ is extremely restrictive.\n\nConsider: if $\\alpha = 2017 + \\epsilon$ for small irrational $\\epsilon > 0$, then $\\alpha^n$ will eventually have fractional parts that make it impossible for $\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\rfloor$ to always be divisible by 2017.\n\nThe condition requires that for every $n \\geq 1$, the floor of $\\alpha^n$ is a multiple of 2017. This is essentially impossible for an irrational $\\alpha$ because the fractional parts of powers of irrationals are equidistributed (by Weyl's equidistribution theorem), making it impossible to consistently land on multiples of 2017.\n\nTherefore, **NO**, such an irrational number does not exist.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found that Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3, so Q'(x) = 2x + 2, which has root r = -1. Then k = Q(-1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. The question asks if there exists an irrational α > 1 such that floor(α^n) ≡ 0 (mod 2017) for all n ≥ 1. This would require floor(α^n) to be divisible by 2017 for all n ≥ 1. For an irrational number, the fractional parts of its powers are equidistributed, making it impossible to consistently have floor(α^n) be a multiple of 2017 for all n. Therefore, no such irrational number exists.\",\n    \"answer\": \"No\"\n}",
