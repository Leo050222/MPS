  "math_problem": "I have 8 unit cubes of different colors, which I want to glue together into a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ cube. How many distinct $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ cubes can I make? Rotations of the same cube are not considered distinct, but reflections are. Instead of determining the number of distinct cubes up to rotations, simply find $k = m - 34$, where $m$ is the number of ways to choose which of the remaining cubes occupy the positions adjacent to the fixed cube, derived from the analysis of fixing one cube's position to account for rotational symmetry. Find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial $P(x)=x^{4}-(k + 28) x^{3}+a x^{2}+b x+c$, given that $P(5)=(k + 10), P(11)=(k + 16)$, and $P(17)=(k + 22)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the cube arrangement problem\n\nWe have 8 unit cubes of different colors to arrange into a 2×2×2 cube. We need to find the number of distinct arrangements where rotations are considered the same, but reflections are different.\n\n## Step 2: Finding m using Burnside's lemma approach\n\nWhen we fix one cube's position to account for rotational symmetry, we need to count arrangements of the remaining 7 cubes.\n\nThe rotation group of a cube has 24 elements:\n- 1 identity\n- 6 face rotations (90° and 270° around 3 axes)\n- 3 face rotations (180° around 3 axes)\n- 8 vertex rotations (120° and 240° around 4 body diagonals)\n- 6 edge rotations (180° around 6 edge-to-edge axes)\n\nHowever, the problem states we should find m from \"the analysis of fixing one cube's position to account for rotational symmetry.\"\n\nIf we fix one cube in a corner position, the remaining 7 cubes can be arranged in the other 7 positions. The number of ways to arrange 7 distinct cubes in 7 positions is 7! = 5040.\n\nBut we need to account for the rotational symmetry. The stabilizer of a corner has 3 rotations (including identity), so we divide by 3.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The problem asks for \"the number of ways to choose which of the remaining cubes occupy the positions adjacent to the fixed cube.\"\n\nIf we fix one corner cube, it has 3 adjacent positions. We need to choose 3 cubes from the remaining 7 for these positions and arrange them: 7×6×5 = 210.\n\nThen we arrange the remaining 4 cubes in the remaining 4 positions: 4! = 24.\n\nSo m = 210 × 24 = 5040.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the problem statement more carefully. It says \"m is the number of ways to choose which of the remaining cubes occupy the positions adjacent to the fixed cube.\"\n\nIf we fix one cube, there are 3 adjacent positions. The number of ways to choose and arrange 3 cubes from 7 remaining cubes in these 3 positions is P(7,3) = 7!/(7-3)! = 7×6×5 = 210.\n\nSo m = 210.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate k\n\nk = m - 34 = 210 - 34 = 176\n\n## Step 4: Set up the polynomial\n\nP(x) = x⁴ - (k+28)x³ + ax² + bx + c\nP(x) = x⁴ - 204x³ + ax² + bx + c\n\n## Step 5: Use the given conditions\n\nP(5) = k + 10 = 186\nP(11) = k + 16 = 192\nP(17) = k + 22 = 198\n\nFrom P(5) = 186:\n625 - 204(125) + 25a + 5b + c = 186\n625 - 25500 + 25a + 5b + c = 186\n25a + 5b + c = 25061\n\nFrom P(11) = 192:\n14641 - 204(1331) + 121a + 11b + c = 192\n14641 - 271524 + 121a + 11b + c = 192\n121a + 11b + c = 257075\n\nFrom P(17) = 198:\n83521 - 204(4913) + 289a + 17b + c = 198\n83521 - 1002252 + 289a + 17b + c = 198\n289a + 17b + c = 918929\n\n## Step 6: Solve the system\n\nFrom equations:\n25a + 5b + c = 25061 ... (1)\n121a + 11b + c = 257075 ... (2)\n289a + 17b + c = 918929 ... (3)\n\n(2) - (1): 96a + 6b = 232014 → 16a + b = 38669\n(3) - (2): 168a + 6b = 661854 → 28a + b = 110309\n\nFrom these: 12a = 71640 → a = 5970\n\nb = 38669 - 16(5970) = 38669 - 95520 = -56851\n\nc = 25061 - 25(5970) - 5(-56851) = 25061 - 149250 + 284255 = 160066\n\n## Step 7: Find sum of coefficients\n\nSum = 1 + (-204) + 5970 + (-56851) + 160066 = 108982\n\n{  \n            \"reasoning\": \"Fixed one cube position, found m=210 ways to arrange adjacent cubes, calculated k=176, set up polynomial with k+28=204, solved system of equations to find a=5970, b=-56851, c=160066, summed all coefficients: 1-204+5970-56851+160066=108982\",\n            \"answer\": \"108982\"\n        }",
