Prove the inequality\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{a^3+8}+\\frac{b}{b^3+8}+\\frac{c}{c^3+8}+\\frac{d}{d^3+8}\\le\\frac{4}{9}\n\\] Instead of proving the inequality for the sum of the function values over the non-negative reals summing to 4, simply find $k = p(1) + 1$, where $p(x)$ is the numerator polynomial in the scaled difference between the tangent line approximation to the function $f(t) = t / (t^3 + 8)$ at $t=1$ and the function itself, derived from the analysis of the approximation's validity. Let $x, y, n$ be positive integers with $n > k$. How many ordered triples $(x, y, n)$ of solutions are there to the equation $x^{n}-y^{n}=2^{(k + 99)}$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the function and find the tangent line at t=1\n\nGiven function: $f(t) = \\frac{t}{t^3 + 8}$\n\nAt $t = 1$:\n- $f(1) = \\frac{1}{1 + 8} = \\frac{1}{9}$\n\nTo find the tangent line, I need $f'(t)$:\n$$f'(t) = \\frac{(t^3 + 8) - t \\cdot 3t^2}{(t^3 + 8)^2} = \\frac{t^3 + 8 - 3t^3}{(t^3 + 8)^2} = \\frac{8 - 2t^3}{(t^3 + 8)^2}$$\n\nAt $t = 1$:\n$$f'(1) = \\frac{8 - 2}{(1 + 8)^2} = \\frac{6}{81} = \\frac{2}{27}$$\n\nThe tangent line at $t = 1$ is:\n$$L(t) = f(1) + f'(1)(t - 1) = \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2}{27}(t - 1) = \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2t}{27} - \\frac{2}{27} = \\frac{3 + 2t - 2}{27} = \\frac{2t + 1}{27}$$\n\n## Step 2: Find the difference between tangent line and function\n\n$$L(t) - f(t) = \\frac{2t + 1}{27} - \\frac{t}{t^3 + 8}$$\n\nFinding common denominator:\n$$L(t) - f(t) = \\frac{(2t + 1)(t^3 + 8) - 27t}{27(t^3 + 8)}$$\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n$$(2t + 1)(t^3 + 8) - 27t = 2t^4 + 16t + t^3 + 8 - 27t = 2t^4 + t^3 - 11t + 8$$\n\nSo:\n$$L(t) - f(t) = \\frac{2t^4 + t^3 - 11t + 8}{27(t^3 + 8)}$$\n\n## Step 3: Find k\n\nThe numerator polynomial is $p(t) = 2t^4 + t^3 - 11t + 8$\n\nAt $t = 1$:\n$$p(1) = 2(1) + 1 - 11 + 8 = 2 + 1 - 11 + 8 = 0$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$k = p(1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$$\n\n## Step 4: Solve the Diophantine equation\n\nWe need to find ordered triples $(x, y, n)$ where $x, y, n$ are positive integers with $n > k = 1$ (so $n \\geq 2$) such that:\n$$x^n - y^n = 2^{k + 99} = 2^{1 + 99} = 2^{100}$$\n\nFor $x^n - y^n = 2^{100}$, we can factor:\n$$x^n - y^n = (x - y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \\cdots + y^{n-1})$$\n\nSince the right side is $2^{100}$, both $x$ and $y$ must have the form $2^a$ for some non-negative integers.\n\nLet $x = 2^a$ and $y = 2^b$ where $a > b \\geq 0$.\n\nThen: $2^{an} - 2^{bn} = 2^{100}$\n$$2^{bn}(2^{n(a-b)} - 1) = 2^{100}$$\n\nFor this to hold, we need $2^{n(a-b)} - 1$ to be a power of 2, which means $2^{n(a-b)} - 1$ must equal 1 (since $2^k - 1$ is odd for $k > 0$).\n\nThis gives us $2^{n(a-b)} = 2$, so $n(a-b) = 1$.\n\nSince $n \\geq 2$ and $a > b$, we need $n = 1$ and $a - b = 1$, but $n > 1$ is required.\n\nActually, we need $bn = 100$ and $n(a-b) = 1$. But $n \\geq 2$ means $a - b = 1/n < 1$, which is impossible for integers.\n\nLet me reconsider: If $x = y + 1$ and both are odd, or if we have specific small cases.\n\nFor $n = 2$: $x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y) = 2^{100}$\nSolutions: $x - y = 2^i$, $x + y = 2^{100-i}$ for $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, 100$\nThis gives 101 solutions for $n = 2$.\n\nFor $n \\geq 3$: The equation $x^n - y^n = 2^{100}$ has very limited solutions. By Mihăilescu's theorem (formerly Catalan's conjecture), the only solution to $x^p - y^q = 1$ with $p, q > 1$ is $3^2 - 2^3 = 1$. For our case with $2^{100}$, solutions are extremely rare.\n\nThe answer is **101**.\n\n{  \n            \"reasoning\": \"After finding k=1 from p(1)+1 where p(t)=2t^4+t^3-11t+8, we solve x^n-y^n=2^100 for n>1.
