  "math_problem": "A point $(x, y)$ is selected uniformly at random from the unit square $S=\\{(x, y) \\mid 0 \\leq x \\leq 1,0 \\leq y \\leq 1\\}$. If the probability that $(3x+2y, x+4y)$ is in $S$ is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a+b$. Instead of computing the numerical identifier from the fractional probability that the transformed point remains within the unit square, simply find $k=$ area$(R) + 1553/120$, where area$(R)$ is the measure of the subset of the unit square on which both components of the linear transformation are at most 1. In bridge, a standard 52-card deck is dealt in the usual way to 4 players. By convention, each hand is assigned a number of \"points\" based on the formula $$(k - 9) \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~A} \\text {'s })+(k - 10) \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~K} \\text {'s })+(k - 11) \\times(\\# \\mathrm{Q} \\text {'s })+(k - 12) \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~J} \\text {'s })$$ Given that a particular hand has exactly 4 cards that are A, K, Q, or J, find the probability that its point value is $k$ or higher.",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. The problem has two parts that seem to be connected through the value of $k$.\n\n**Part 1: Finding k**\n\nWe need to find the area of region $R$ where a point $(x,y)$ from the unit square transforms to $(3x+2y, x+4y)$ that stays in the unit square.\n\nFor $(3x+2y, x+4y) \\in S$, we need:\n- $0 \\leq 3x+2y \\leq 1$\n- $0 \\leq x+4y \\leq 1$\n- $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$\n- $0 \\leq y \\leq 1$\n\nSince $x,y \\geq 0$, the conditions $3x+2y \\geq 0$ and $x+4y \\geq 0$ are automatically satisfied.\n\nWe need:\n1. $3x+2y \\leq 1$\n2. $x+4y \\leq 1$\n3. $x \\leq 1$\n4. $y \\leq 1$\n\nThe region $R$ is bounded by these four inequalities. Let me find the vertices:\n\n- Intersection of $3x+2y=1$ and $x+4y=1$:\n  From the second: $x = 1-4y$\n  Substituting: $3(1-4y)+2y = 1 \\Rightarrow 3-12y+2y = 1 \\Rightarrow -10y = -2 \\Rightarrow y = 1/5$\n  Then $x = 1-4/5 = 1/5$\n  Point: $(1/5, 1/5)$\n\n- Intersection of $3x+2y=1$ and $y=0$: $(1/3, 0)$\n- Intersection of $x+4y=1$ and $x=0$: $(0, 1/4)$\n- Origin: $(0, 0)$\n\nThe region $R$ is a quadrilateral with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(1/3, 0)$, $(1/5, 1/5)$, and $(0, 1/4)$.\n\nUsing the shoelace formula:\nArea = $\\frac{1}{2}|x_1(y_2-y_4) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_4-y_2) + x_4(y_1-y_3)|$\n\nWith vertices in order: $(0,0)$, $(1/3,0)$, $(1/5,1/5)$, $(0,1/4)$:\nArea = $\\frac{1}{2}|0(0-1/4) + 1/3(1/5-0) + 1/5(1/4-0) + 0(0-1/5)|$\nArea = $\\frac{1}{2}|1/15 + 1/20|$\nArea = $\\frac{1}{2}|\\frac{4+3}{60}| = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{7}{60} = \\frac{7}{120}$\n\nTherefore:\n$k = \\frac{7}{120} + \\frac{1553}{120} = \\frac{1560}{120} = 13$\n\n**Part 2: Bridge probability with k=13**\n\nThe point formula becomes:\n$4 \\times (\\# A's) + 3 \\times (\\# K's) + 2 \\times (\\# Q's) + 1 \\times (\\# J's)$\n\nWe need the probability that a hand with exactly 4 cards from {A, K, Q, J} has point value $\\geq 13$.\n\nTotal ways to choose 4 cards from 16 (4 each of A, K, Q, J): $\\binom{16}{4} = 1820$\n\nFor point value $\\geq 13$, we need combinations where $4a + 3b + 2c + d \\geq 13$ with $a+b+c+d = 4$.\n\nMaximum is $4 \\times 4 = 16$ (all Aces).\n\nLet me enumerate cases where the sum is $\\geq 13$:\n- $(4,0,0,0)$: 16 points, $\\binom{4}{4} = 1$ way\n- $(3,1,0,0)$: 15 points, $\\binom{4}{3}\\binom{4}{1} = 16$ ways\n- $(3,0,1,0)$: 14 points, $\\binom{4}{3}\\binom{4}{1} = 16$ ways\n- $(2,2,0,0)$: 14 points, $\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{4}{2} = 36$ ways\n- $(3,0,0,1)$: 13 points, $\\binom{4}{3}\\binom{4}{1} = 16$ ways\n- $(2,1,1,0)$: 13 points, $\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{4}{1} = 96$ ways\n\nTotal favorable outcomes: $1 + 16 + 16 + 36 + 16 + 96 = 181$\n\nProbability = $\\frac{181}{1820} = \\frac{181}{1820}$\n\nSince $\\gcd(181, 1820) = 1$ (181 is prime and doesn't divide 1820), this is already in lowest terms.\n\nWait, let me verify: $1820 = 4 \\times 455 = 4 \\times 5 \\times 91 = 20 \\times 91 = 20 \\times 7 \\times 13$\n\nSo the probability is $\\frac{181}{1820}$.\n\n{  \n            \"reasoning\": \"First, I found k by calculating the area of region R where the transformation keeps points in the unit square.
