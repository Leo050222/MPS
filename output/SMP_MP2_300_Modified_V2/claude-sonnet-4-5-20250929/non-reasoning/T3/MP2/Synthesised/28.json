  "math_problem": "Let $p(m)=m^5-5m^3+4m$. Find the largest integer that divides $p(m)$ for all integers $m\\geq 5$. Instead of determining the largest positive integer dividing the polynomial's values at all integers greater than or equal to five, simply find $k=p(10)-95037$, where $p(m)$ is the given quintic polynomial. Find all pairs of integer solutions $(n, m)$ to $2^{3^{n}}=k^{2^{m}}-1$.",

However, by Mihăilescu's theorem (formerly Catalan's conjecture, proved in 2002), the only solution to $x^p - y^q = 1$ with $x, y, p, q > 1$ is $3^2 - 2^3 = 1$.\n\nFor our equation $3^{2^m} - 2^{3^n} = 1$, we need $3^{2^m} = 2^{3^n} + 1$.\n\nThe solutions we found are $(0, 0)$ and $(1, 1)$.\n\nFor larger values, by properties of exponential Diophantine equations and the rapid growth of both sides, no other integer solutions exist.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe pairs of integer solutions are $(n, m) = (0, 0)$ and $(n, m) = (1, 1)$.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I calculated p(10) = 10^5 - 5(10^3) + 4(10) = 100000 - 5000 + 40 = 95040. Then k = p(10) - 95037 = 95040 - 95037 = 3. The equation becomes 2^(3^n) = 3^(2^m) - 1, or 2^(3^n) + 1 = 3^(2^m). Testing small values: For n=0: 2^1 + 1 = 3 = 3^1, so 2^m = 1, giving m=0. For n=1: 2^3 + 1 = 9 = 3^2, so 2^m = 2, giving m=1. For n=2: 2^9 + 1 = 513, which is not a power of 3. For larger n, the equation has no solutions by properties of exponential Diophantine equations.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(0, 0) and (1, 1)\"\n}",
