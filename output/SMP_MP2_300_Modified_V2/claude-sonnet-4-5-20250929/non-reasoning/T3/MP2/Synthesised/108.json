  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be square with 4 digits, such that all its digits are less than 6. If we add 1 to each digit the resulting number is another square. Find $n$ Instead of identifying the 4-digit perfect square satisfying the digit increment condition, simply find $m = a - 42$, where $a$ is the integer whose square is that number. P is a polynomial. When P is divided by $x-1$, the remainder is -4 . When P is divided by $x-2$, the remainder is -1 . When $P$ is divided by $x-3$, the remainder is 4 . Determine the remainder when $P$ is divided by $x^{m}-6 x^{2}+11 x-6$.",

This gives m = 45 - 42 = 3. Then, I factored x³ - 6x² + 11x - 6 = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) and used the Remainder Theorem with the given conditions P(1) = -4, P(2) = -1, P(3) = 4 to find that the remainder when P is divided by x³ - 6x² + 11x - 6 is the quadratic R(x) = x² - 5.\",\n    \"answer\": \"x² - 5\"\n}",
