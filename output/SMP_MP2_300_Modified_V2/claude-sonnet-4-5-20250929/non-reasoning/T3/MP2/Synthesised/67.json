  "math_problem": "For a given positive integer $n$, we define $\\varphi(n)$ to be the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ which share no common prime factors with $n$. Find all positive integers $n$ for which $\\varphi(2019 n)=\\varphi\\left(n^{2}\\right)$. Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ for which $\\varphi(2019 n)=\\varphi(n^2)$, simply find $k=\\gcd(2019,n)-2018$, where $n$ is the positive integer solution that is a multiple of $2019$. The sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$ of real numbers satisfies the recurrence $a_{n+1}=\\frac{a_{n}^{2}-a_{n-1}+2 a_{n}}{a_{n-1}+k}$. Given that $a_{1}=k$ and $a_{9}=(k + 6)$, find $a_{5}$.",

Let me try a different approach by looking for patterns.\n\nLet me try assuming the sequence has a simple form. If $a_n = n$ for all $n$:\n$a_{n+1} = \\frac{n^2 - (n-1) + 2n}{(n-1) + 1} = \\frac{n^2 + n + 1}{n} = n + 1 + \\frac{1}{n}$\n\nThis doesn't work unless $n$ divides 1.\n\nLet me try $a_n = 2n - 1$:\n- $a_1 = 1$ ✓\n- $a_9 = 17$ ✗\n\nLet me try $a_n = \\frac{2n+3}{3}$ or similar linear forms.\n\nActually, let me verify with $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2$:\n$a_3 = \\frac{4 - 1 + 4}{1 + 1} = \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5$\n\n$a_4 = \\frac{(3.5)^2 - 2 + 7}{2 + 1} = \\frac{12.25 - 2 + 7}{3} = \\frac{17.25}{3} = 5.75$\n\nLet me try $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 3$:\n$a_3 = \\frac{9 - 1 + 6}{2} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7$\n\n$a_4 = \\frac{49 - 3 + 14}{3 + 1} = \\frac{60}{4} = 15$\n\nThis seems to grow too fast.\n\nAfter testing, if $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 3, a_4 = 4, a_5 = 5$, then $a_9 = 9 \\neq 7$.\n\nLet me reconsider: perhaps $a_n = n - 2$ for $n \\geq 3$?\nThen $a_5 = 3$.\n\n{  \n            \"reasoning\": \"First, I found k by solving φ(2019n) = φ(n²).
