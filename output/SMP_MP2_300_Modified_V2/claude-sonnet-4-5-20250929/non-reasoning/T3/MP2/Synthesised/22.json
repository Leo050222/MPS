Compute $a_{1337}$. Instead of computing the specified term of the sequence satisfying the given relation between squared partial sums and partial sums of cubes, simply find $k = S_1$, where $S_1$ is the partial sum up to the first term derived from the relation for $m=1$. Find all ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive reals that satisfy: $\\lfloor a\\rfloor b c=k$, $a\\lfloor b\\rfloor c=(k + 1)$, and $a b\\lfloor c\\rfloor=(k + 2)$, where $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.",
