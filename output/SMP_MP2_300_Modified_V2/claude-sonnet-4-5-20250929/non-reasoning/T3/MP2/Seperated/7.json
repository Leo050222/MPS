To have maximum degree exactly 5 means:\n- At least one vertex has degree 5\n- No vertex has degree greater than 5\n\nFor a triangle-free graph with 23 edges on 10 vertices:\n- Average degree = $\\frac{2 \\times 23}{10} = 4.6$\n- The graph must avoid all triangles\n\nFinding $N_{\\Delta=5}$ requires:\n1. Counting configurations where max degree is exactly 5\n2. Ensuring no triangles exist\n3. Having exactly 23 edges\n\nThis is computationally intensive. Based on the structure of the problem (asking for $m = N_{\\Delta=5} - 37798$), this suggests a specific computational result.\n\nGiven the complexity and the specific subtraction value provided, this appears to be a competition problem with a computed answer. Through exhaustive computational enumeration (which would be done programmatically), the value of $N_{\\Delta=5}$ for triangle-free graphs with 23 edges on 10 labeled vertices where maximum degree is exactly 5 would need to be calculated.\n\nBased on the problem structure, $m = N_{\\Delta=5} - 37798$.\n\n## Problem 2: Finding $f(-2)$\n\nGiven: $3f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + \\frac{2f(x)}{x} = x^{2}$ for $x \\neq 0$\n\n**Step 1:** Let's substitute $x$ with $\\frac{1}{x}$ in the original equation:\n\n$3f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x}}\\right) + \\frac{2f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{x}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{2}$\n\n$3f(x) + 2xf\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$\n\n**Step 2:** Now we have two equations:\n- Equation 1: $3f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + \\frac{2f(x)}{x} = x^{2}$\n- Equation 2: $3f(x) + 2xf\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply Equation 1 by $2x$:\n$6xf\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + 4f(x) = 2x^3$\n\n**Step 4:** Multiply Equation 2 by $3$:\n$9f(x) + 6xf\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\frac{3}{x^2}$\n\n**Step 5:** Subtract the equation from Step 3 from the equation in Step 4:\n$9f(x) + 6xf\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) - 6xf\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) - 4f(x) = \\frac{3}{x^2} - 2x^3$\n\n$5f(x) = \\frac{3}{x^2} - 2x^3$\n\n$f(x) = \\frac{3}{5x^2} - \\frac{2x^3}{5}$\n\n**Step 6:** Calculate $f(-2)$:\n$f(-2) = \\frac{3}{5(-2)^2} - \\frac{2(-2)^3}{5}$\n\n$f(-2) = \\frac{3}{5 \\cdot 4} - \\frac{2 \\cdot (-8)}{5}$\n\n$f(-2) = \\frac{3}{20} - \\frac{-16}{5}$\n\n$f(-2) = \\frac{3}{20} + \\frac{16}{5}$\n\n$f(-2) = \\frac{3}{20} + \\frac{64}{20}$\n\n$f(-2) = \\frac{67}{20}$\n\nFor Problem 1, without computational tools to enumerate all triangle-free graphs, I cannot provide the exact value of $N_{\\Delta=5}$. However, based on typical competition problem structures, if this yields a clean answer, $m$ would be a specific integer value.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1 requires computational enumeration of triangle-free graphs which I cannot complete exactly. Problem 2 is solved by creating a system of equations through substitution, yielding f(x) = 3/(5x²) - 2x³/5, and f(-2) = 67/20.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"Unable to compute without computational tools\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"67/20\"\n}",
