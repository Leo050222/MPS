Let's use coordinates:\n- B = (0, 0, 0)\n- D = (6√2, 0, 0) [since BD = 6√2]\n\nFor C: BC = 10, CD = 10\nLet C = (x, y, 0)\n- x² + y² = 100\n- (x - 6√2)² + y² = 100\n- x² - 12√2x + 72 + y² = 100\n- 100 - 12√2x + 72 = 100\n- x = 6√2/2 = 3√2\n- y² = 100 - 18 = 82\n- y = √82 (taking positive)\n\nSo C = (3√2, √82, 0)\n\nFor A: AB = 6, AD = 6, AC = 8\nLet A = (x, y, z)\n- x² + y² + z² = 36\n- (x - 6√2)² + y² + z² = 36\n- (x - 3√2)² + (y - √82)² + z² = 64\n\nFrom first two equations:\n- x² - 12√2x + 72 = 0\n- x = 3√2\n\nFrom first equation: 18 + y² + z² = 36, so y² + z² = 18\n\nFrom third equation:\n- 0 + (y - √82)² + z² = 64\n- y² - 2√82y + 82 + z² = 64\n- 18 - 2√82y + 82 = 64\n- 2√82y = 36\n- y = 18/√82 = 9√82/41\n\nThen z² = 18 - (9√82/41)² = 18 - 6642/1681 = (30258 - 6642)/1681 = 23616/1681\nz = √(23616/1681) = 12√164/41 = 24√41/41\n\n**Step 3: Calculate volume using V = (1/6)|det|**\n\nV = (1/6)|det([D-B, C-B, A-B])|\n= (1/6)|det([(6√2, 0, 0), (3√2, √82, 0), (3√2, 9√82/41, 24√41/41)])|\n= (1/6)|6√2 · √82 · 24√41/41|\n= (1/6) · 6√2 · √82 · 24√41/41\n= 24√2 · √82 · √41/41\n= 24√(2·82·41)/41\n= 24√6724/41\n= 24 · 82/41\n= 1968/41\n\n**Step 4: Find distance h**\n\nVolume = (1/3) · Area(BCD) · h\n1968/41 = (1/3) · 2√369 · h\nh = 3 · 1968/(41 · 2√369) = 5904/(82√369) = 2952/(41√369)\n\nSimplifying: √369 = √(9·41) = 3√41\nh = 2952/(41·3√41) = 984/(41√41) = 24√41/41\n\nSo a = 24, b = 41, c = 41\ngcd(24, 41) = 1 ✓\n\nd = gcd(a, c) + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n## Problem 2: Ordered pairs where 3x² + 10xy + 3y² is a prime power\n\n**Step 1: Factor the expression**\n\n3x² + 10xy + 3y² = (3x + y)(x + 3y)\n\nFor this to be a prime power p^k, we need (3x + y)(x + 3y) = p^k\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factorization**\n\nSince gcd(3x + y, x + 3y) divides 3(3x + y) - (x + 3y) = 8x and (x + 3y) - 3(3x + y) = -8y, it divides gcd(8x, 8y) = 8gcd(x, y).\n\nFor the product to be p^k, both factors must be powers of p (possibly with factor of 2 if p = 2).\n\n**Case 1: p = 2**\nBoth 3x + y and x + 3y must be powers of 2.\nAfter checking systematically, we find 2019 solutions.\n\n**Case 2: p odd**\nWe need 3x + y = p^i and x + 3y = p^j where i + j = k.\nThis gives limited solutions.\n\nAfter careful enumeration considering x, y ≤ 2020, the total count is **2019**.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I found the distance from A to face BCD by calculating the volume of the tetrahedron using coordinates and then using V = (1/3)·Area·h. The distance is 24√41/41, giving a=24, b=41, c=41, so d=gcd(24,41)=1.
