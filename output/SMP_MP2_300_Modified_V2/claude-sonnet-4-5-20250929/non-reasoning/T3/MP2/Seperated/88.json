      "A2522": "In the game of Galactic Dominion, players compete to amass cards, each of which is worth a certain number of points. Say you are playing a version of this game with only two kinds of cards, planet cards and hegemon cards. Each planet card is worth 2010 points, and each hegemon card is worth four points per planet card held. You start with no planet cards and no hegemon cards, and, on each turn, starting at turn one, you take either a planet card or a hegemon card, whichever is worth more points given the hand you currently hold. Define a sequence $\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}$ for all positive integers $n$ by setting $a_{n}$ to be 0 if on turn $n$ you take a planet card and 1 if you take a hegemon card. What is the smallest value of $N$ such that the sequence $a_{N}, a_{N+1}, \\ldots$ is necessarily periodic (meaning that there is a positive integer $k$ such that $a_{n+k}=a_{n}$ for all $\\left.n \\geq N\\right)$ ? Instead of determining the minimal index from which the tail of the sequence is periodic, simply find \\(k = a_{502} + 9\\), where \\(a_{502}\\) is the term of the sequence at position 502 derived from the game's decision rules."

  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Galactic Dominion Card Game\n\nLet me denote:\n- $p$ = number of planet cards held\n- $h$ = number of hegemon cards held\n\nThe total score is: $2010p + 4ph$\n\nOn each turn, I need to decide whether to take a planet card or a hegemon card.\n\n**Value of taking a planet card:** The new score would be $2010(p+1) + 4(p+1)h = 2010p + 4ph + 2010 + 4h$\nSo the gain is: $2010 + 4h$\n\n**Value of taking a hegemon card:** The new score would be $2010p + 4p(h+1) = 2010p + 4ph + 4p$\nSo the gain is: $4p$\n\n**Decision rule:** Take a planet card if $2010 + 4h > 4p$, i.e., if $p < 502.5 + h$, or equivalently $p \\leq 502 + h$.\n\nLet me trace through the sequence:\n- Turn 1: $p=0, h=0$. Since $0 \\leq 502$, take planet. $a_1 = 0$. Now $p=1, h=0$.\n- Turn 2: $p=1, h=0$. Since $1 \\leq 502$, take planet. $a_2 = 0$. Now $p=2, h=0$.\n- ...\n- Turn 502: $p=501, h=0$. Since $501 \\leq 502$, take planet. $a_{502} = 0$. Now $p=502, h=0$.\n- Turn 503: $p=502, h=0$. Since $502 \\leq 502$, take planet. $a_{503} = 0$. Now $p=503, h=0$.\n- Turn 504: $p=503, h=0$. Since $503 > 502$, take hegemon. $a_{504} = 1$. Now $p=503, h=1$.\n- Turn 505: $p=503, h=1$. Since $503 \\leq 503$, take planet. $a_{505} = 0$. Now $p=504, h=1$.\n- Turn 506: $p=504, h=1$. Since $504 > 503$, take hegemon. $a_{506} = 1$. Now $p=504, h=2$.\n- Turn 507: $p=504, h=2$. Since $504 \\leq 504$, take planet. $a_{507} = 0$. Now $p=505, h=2$.\n- Turn 508: $p=505, h=2$. Since $505 > 504$, take hegemon. $a_{508} = 1$. Now $p=505, h=3$.\n\nThe pattern from turn 504 onwards is: take hegemon, then planet, repeating with period 2.\n\nSo $a_{502} = 0$.\n\nTherefore, $k = a_{502} + 9 = 0 + 9 = 9$.\n\n## Problem 2: Sum of Rational Numbers\n\nLet $x = \\frac{a}{b}$ and $y = \\frac{c}{d}$ where $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$ and $\\gcd(c,d) = 1$.\n\nGiven: $a + c = 9$ and $b + d = 10$.\n\nWe want to maximize $x + y = \\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad + bc}{bd}$.\n\nSince $c = 9 - a$ and $d = 10 - b$:\n$$x + y = \\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{9-a}{10-b} = \\frac{a(10-b) + b(9-a)}{b(10-b)} = \\frac{10a - ab + 9b - ab}{b(10-b)} = \\frac{10a + 9b - 2ab}{b(10-b)}$$\n\nLet me check possible values systematically. We need $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$ and $\\gcd(9-a, 10-b) = 1$.\n\nFor $b = 1$: $d = 9$, so $y = \\frac{9-a}{9}$. For this to be in lowest terms, $\\gcd(9-a, 9) = 1$, so $9-a$ must not be divisible by 3. Thus $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n- $a = 8$: $x + y = \\frac{8}{1} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{73}{9}$\n\nFor $b = 3$: $d = 7$, so $y = \\frac{9-a}{7}$. Need $\\gcd(a,3) = 1$ and $\\gcd(9-a, 7) = 1$.\n- $a = 8$: $x + y = \\frac{8}{3} + \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{59}{21}$\n- $a = 7$: $x + y = \\frac{7}{3} + \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{55}{21}$\n\nFor $b = 7$: $d = 3$, so $y = \\frac{9-a}{3}$. Need $\\gcd(a,7) = 1$ and $\\gcd(9-a, 3) = 1$.\n- $a = 8$: $x + y = \\frac{8}{7} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{31}{21}$\n\nFor $b = 9$: $d = 1$, so $y = 9-a$. Need $\\gcd(a,9) = 1$.\n- $a = 1$: $x + y = \\frac{1}{9} + 8 = \\frac{73}{9}$\n\nThe maximum is $\\frac{73}{9}$.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I traced the decision rule p ≤ 502 + h to find that a_502 = 0, giving k = 9.
