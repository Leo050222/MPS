Every minute, he tosses a fat coin. If it's heads, he moves left, decreasing his coordinate by 1; if it's tails, he moves right, increasing his coordinate by 1. If the coin lands on its edge, he moves back to 0. If Mr. Fat does this ad infinitum, what fraction of his time will he spend at 0? Instead of finding the long-run proportion of time spent at the origin, simply find $e = r + \\frac{9}{2}$, where $r$ is the factor less than 1 by which the stationary probability at distance $n$ from 0 relates to that at distance $n+1$, derived from the balance equations for the long-run proportions at non-zero positions."

The balance equation should account for the edge landing:\n\nFor $n \\geq 1$:\n$$\\pi_n \\left(\\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{5}\\right) = \\pi_{n-1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} + \\pi_{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5}$$\n\nWait, this is just $\\pi_n = \\pi_{n-1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} + \\pi_{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5}$\n\nSo: $5\\pi_n = 2\\pi_{n-1} + 2\\pi_{n+1}$\n\nAssuming $\\pi_n = \\pi_1 r^{n-1}$:\n$$5r = 2 + 2r^2$$\n$$2r^2 - 5r + 2 = 0$$\n$$r = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25-16}}{4} = \\frac{5 \\pm 3}{4}$$\n\nSo $r = 2$ or $r = 1/2$.\n\nSince we need $r < 1$, we have $r = 1/2$.\n\nTherefore:\n$$e = r + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{9}{2} = 5$$\n\n## Problem 2: Finding X\n\nThe problem references \"problem 15\" and variable $Z$. Without the context of problem 15, I cannot determine what $Z$ is. However, based on the structure of the problem set, if $Z$ relates to the answer from Problem 1, then $Z = 5$.\n\nIf $Z = 5$, then we need the greatest integer $X$ such that $|XZ| \\leq 5$, which means $|5X| \\leq 5$, so $|X| \\leq 1$.\n\nThe greatest integer satisfying this is $X = 1$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I set up balance equations for the stationary distribution. For non-zero positions n, the balance gives 5π_n = 2π_{n-1} + 2π_{n+1}. Assuming geometric decay π_n = π_1·r^{n-1}, this yields 2r^2 - 5r + 2 = 0, giving r = 1/2. Thus e = r + 9/2 = 1/2 + 9/2 = 5. For Problem 2, assuming Z refers to the answer from Problem 1 (Z=5), we need |5X| ≤ 5, so |X| ≤ 1, giving X = 1.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n        }",
