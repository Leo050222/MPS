Then we need:\ns(s-1) = n-1\n\nThis means: n = s(s-1) + 1 = s² - s + 1\n\nNow I need to check when the sum of digits of n equals s.\n\nLet me try small values of s:\n\n**s = 1:** n = 1² - 1 + 1 = 1, S(1) = 1 ✓\n\n**s = 2:** n = 2² - 2 + 1 = 3, S(3) = 3 ✗\n\n**s = 3:** n = 3² - 3 + 1 = 7, S(7) = 7 ✗\n\n**s = 4:** n = 4² - 4 + 1 = 13, S(13) = 4 ✓\n\n**s = 5:** n = 5² - 5 + 1 = 21, S(21) = 3 ✗\n\n**s = 6:** n = 6² - 6 + 1 = 31, S(31) = 4 ✗\n\n**s = 7:** n = 7² - 7 + 1 = 43, S(43) = 7 ✓\n\n**s = 8:** n = 8² - 8 + 1 = 57, S(57) = 12 ✗\n\n**s = 9:** n = 9² - 9 + 1 = 73, S(73) = 10 ✗\n\n**s = 10:** n = 10² - 10 + 1 = 91, S(91) = 10 ✓\n\nSo the solutions I found are: n = 1, 13, 43, 91, ...\n\nThe smallest positive integer is n = 1, with S(1) = 1.\n\nTherefore, k = S(n) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\n## Problem 2: Maximum volume of a figure with 5 vertices chosen from a unit cube\n\nA unit cube has 8 vertices. We need to choose 5 of them to maximize the volume of the convex hull.\n\nThe vertices of a unit cube can be placed at coordinates:\n(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1)\n\nTo maximize volume, we should remove 3 vertices that are close together. The best strategy is to remove 3 vertices that share a common vertex (forming a corner).\n\nIf we remove three vertices adjacent to one corner, we get a configuration that forms a pyramid-like shape.\n\nLet's remove the three vertices adjacent to (0,0,0): (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1).\n\nThe remaining 5 vertices are:\n- (0,0,0)\n- (1,1,0)\n- (1,0,1)\n- (0,1,1)\n- (1,1,1)\n\nActually, let me reconsider. To maximize volume, we want to remove 3 vertices that form a face diagonal or are coplanar in a way that minimizes the removed volume.\n\nThe optimal configuration is to remove 3 vertices that lie on one face of the cube. For example, remove (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0) which are three vertices on the bottom face.\n\nRemaining vertices: (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1), and one from the bottom - let's say (1,1,0).\n\nActually, the maximum volume occurs when we remove 3 vertices that share a common edge or form a minimal configuration.\n\nThe optimal solution: Remove 3 vertices from one triangular face. The remaining 5 vertices form a triangular prism or pyramid.\n\nAfter careful consideration, if we keep 5 vertices forming a square pyramid (4 vertices of one face + 1 opposite vertex), the volume is:\nV = (1/3) × base area × height = (1/3) × 1 × 1 = 1/3\n\nBut we can do better. If we remove 3 vertices that are on the same face but not forming a complete face, we get:\nMaximum volume = 5/6\n\nThe maximum volume is achieved by removing three vertices that form a corner (three edges meeting at one vertex). This leaves a shape with volume = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Testing values of s where n = s² - s + 1, I found that n = 1 (with S(1) = 1) is the smallest solution. Thus k = 1 + 4 = 5. For Problem 2: To maximize the volume of 5 vertices from a unit cube, we remove 3 vertices that meet at a corner. This removes a tetrahedron of volume 1/6, leaving a volume of 5/6.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"5/6\"\n        }",
