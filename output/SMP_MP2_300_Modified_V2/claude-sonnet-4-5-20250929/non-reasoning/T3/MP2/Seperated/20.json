Place A at the origin with BCD in a plane below.\n\nLet's use the fact that A is at distance 2 from each of B, C, D. If we place the centroid of triangle BCD at point G on the z-axis below A, then:\n- A = (0, 0, 0)\n- The altitude AX = h (what we're looking for)\n- B, C, D lie in a plane at distance h from A\n\n**Step 2: Use the volume formula**\nVolume = (1/3) × (Area of BCD) × h = 1\nTherefore: Area of BCD = 3/h\n\n**Step 3: Relate the sides of triangle BCD**\nSince AB = AC = AD = 2, if we project onto the plane BCD, the distances from the projection point X to B, C, D satisfy:\n- XB² = AB² - h² = 4 - h²\n- XC² = AC² - h² = 4 - h²\n- XD² = AD² - h² = 4 - h²\n\nSo X is equidistant from B, C, D, meaning X is the circumcenter of triangle BCD.\nLet R be the circumradius of triangle BCD, so R² = 4 - h².\n\n**Step 4: Use the formula for area in terms of sides and circumradius**\nFor a triangle with sides a, b, c and circumradius R:\nArea = (abc)/(4R)\n\nWith BC · CD · DB = 16:\nArea of BCD = 16/(4R) = 4/R\n\n**Step 5: Combine equations**\nFrom Step 2: Area = 3/h\nFrom Step 4: Area = 4/R\n\nTherefore: 3/h = 4/R\nSo: R = 4h/3\n\n**Step 6: Use R² = 4 - h²**\n(4h/3)² = 4 - h²\n16h²/9 = 4 - h²\n16h²/9 + h² = 4\n16h² + 9h² = 36\n25h² = 36\nh² = 36/25\nh = 6/5\n\n**Step 7: Calculate δ**\nAX = h = 6/5 = 1.2\nδ = AX - 7/10 = 6/5 - 7/10 = 12/10 - 7/10 = 5/10 = 1/2\n\n## Problem 2: Counting lattice points in triangle interior\n\n**Given:**\n- A = (0, 0), B = (200, 100), C = (30, 330)\n- Count integer pairs (x, y) such that (x + 1/2, y + 1/2) is in the interior of triangle ABC\n\n**Step 1: Find equations of the three sides**\n\nLine AB: from (0,0) to (200,100)\nSlope = 1/2, equation: y = x/2 or x - 2y = 0\n\nLine BC: from (200,100) to (30,330)\nSlope = (330-100)/(30-200) = 230/(-170) = -23/17\nEquation: y - 100 = -23/17(x - 200)\n17y - 1700 = -23x + 4600\n23x + 17y = 6300\n\nLine CA: from (30,330) to (0,0)\nSlope = 330/30 = 11\nEquation: y = 11x or 11x - y = 0\n\n**Step 2: Determine interior conditions**\nFor (x + 1/2, y + 1/2) to be in the interior:\n\n1. Above line AB: (x + 1/2) - 2(y + 1/2) < 0 → x - 2y < 0\n2. Below line BC: 23(x + 1/2) + 17(y + 1/2) < 6300 → 23x + 17y < 6280\n3. Below line CA: 11(x + 1/2) - (y + 1/2) > 0 → 11x - y > 0\n\n**Step 3: Use Pick's theorem approach**\nThe number of lattice points (x,y) where (x+1/2, y+1/2) is interior equals the number of lattice points strictly inside the triangle ABC.\n\nBy Pick's theorem: Interior points = Area - Boundary points/2 + 1\n\n**Step 4: Calculate area**\nArea = (1/2)|x₁(y₂ - y₃) + x₂(y₃ - y₁) + x₃(y₁ - y₂)|\n= (1/2)|0(100 - 330) + 200(330 - 0) + 30(0 - 100)|\n= (1/2)|0 + 66000 - 3000|\n= (1/2) × 63000 = 31500\n\n**Step 5: Count boundary points**\n- On AB: gcd(200, 100) + 1 = 100 + 1 = 101 points\n- On BC: gcd(|30-200|, |330-100|) + 1 = gcd(170, 230) + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 points\n- On CA: gcd(30, 330) + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31 points\nTotal boundary = 101 + 11 + 31 - 3 = 140 points\n\n**Step 6: Calculate interior points**\nInterior = Area - Boundary/2 + 1 = 31500 - 70 + 1 = 31431\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Using the volume formula and the constraint that A is equidistant from B, C, D, I found that the altitude h = 6/5, giving δ = 1/2.
