We need to find k = m - 34, where m is related to fixing one cube's position.\n\n**Step 1:** Understanding the setup\n- Total arrangements without any restrictions: 8!\n- We consider rotations as the same, but reflections as distinct\n- The rotation group of a cube has 24 elements\n\n**Step 2:** Fixing one cube's position\nWhen we fix one cube in a specific position to account for rotational symmetry, we need to count arrangements of the remaining 7 cubes in the remaining 7 positions.\n\n**Step 3:** Finding m\nAfter fixing one cube's position, the number of ways to arrange the remaining 7 cubes is:\nm = 7! = 5040\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate k\nk = m - 34 = 5040 - 34 = 5006\n\n## Problem 2: Sum of coefficients of polynomial\n\nGiven: P(x) = x⁴ - 29x³ + ax² + bx + c\nConditions: P(5) = 11, P(11) = 17, P(17) = 23\n\n**Step 1:** Define Q(x) = P(x) - (x + 6)\n\nLet's check if there's a pattern:\n- When x = 5: P(5) = 11 = 5 + 6\n- When x = 11: P(11) = 17 = 11 + 6\n- When x = 17: P(17) = 23 = 17 + 6\n\nSo Q(x) = P(x) - (x + 6) has roots at x = 5, 11, and 17.\n\n**Step 2:** Form Q(x)\nQ(x) = x⁴ - 29x³ + ax² + bx + c - x - 6\nQ(x) = x⁴ - 29x³ + ax² + (b-1)x + (c-6)\n\nSince Q(x) has roots at 5, 11, and 17, we can write:\nQ(x) = (x - 5)(x - 11)(x - 17)(x - r) for some value r\n\n**Step 3:** Expand and compare coefficients\n(x - 5)(x - 11)(x - 17) = x³ - 33x² + 347x - 935\n\nSo Q(x) = (x³ - 33x² + 347x - 935)(x - r)\nQ(x) = x⁴ - rx³ - 33x³ + 33rx² + 347x² - 347rx - 935x + 935r\nQ(x) = x⁴ - (r + 33)x³ + (33r + 347)x² + (-347r - 935)x + 935r\n\n**Step 4:** Match coefficients\nComparing with Q(x) = x⁴ - 29x³ + ax² + (b-1)x + (c-6):\n\nCoefficient of x³: -(r + 33) = -29\nTherefore: r + 33 = 29, so r = -4\n\n**Step 5:** Find a, b, c\n- a = 33r + 347 = 33(-4) + 347 = -132 + 347 = 215\n- b - 1 = -347r - 935 = -347(-4) - 935 = 1388 - 935 = 453\n  So b = 454\n- c - 6 = 935r = 935(-4) = -3740\n  So c = -3734\n\n**Step 6:** Find sum of coefficients\nThe sum of coefficients of P(x) is P(1):\nP(1) = 1 - 29 + a + b + c\nP(1) = 1 - 29 + 215 + 454 + (-3734)\nP(1) = 1 - 29 + 215 + 454 - 3734\nP(1) = -3093\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Fixed one cube's position to account for rotational symmetry, leaving 7! = 5040 ways to arrange remaining cubes, so m = 5040 and k = m - 34 = 5006. For Problem 2: Recognized that P(x) - (x+6) has roots at 5, 11, and 17, so P(x) - (x+6) = (x-5)(x-11)(x-17)(x-r). Matching the x³ coefficient gives r = -4.
