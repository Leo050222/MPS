You continue this until you have 8 pieces of chalk. What is the probability that they all have length $\\frac{1}{8}$ ? Instead of determining the probability that the final pieces are all of equal length, simply find $e = \\binom{6}{3} - 16$, where $\\binom{6}{3}$ is the number of ways to interleave the remaining breaks equally between the two subpieces created by the first break."

By Vieta's formulas, for $k^4 + 0k^3 + 4k^2 + 8k + 720 = 0$, the product of roots is $\\frac{720}{1} = 720$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, we simply calculate the binomial coefficient and subtract 16. For Problem 2, we use Vieta's formulas with the constraint that one root equals the sum of the other three to derive a quartic equation in k, then use Vieta's formulas again to find the product of its roots.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"720\"\n        }",
