This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to $a + b + c = 2002$ where $1 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n\nLet me use the constraint $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a + b + c = 2002$.\n\nSince $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a + b + c = 2002$, we have:\n- $3a \\leq a + b + c = 2002$, so $a \\leq 667.33...$, meaning $a \\leq 667$\n- Also $a \\geq 1$\n\nFor a fixed value of $a$, we need $b + c = 2002 - a$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n\nFrom $b \\leq c$ and $b + c = 2002 - a$:\n- $2b \\leq b + c = 2002 - a$\n- $b \\leq \\frac{2002 - a}{2}$\n\nFrom $a \\leq b$:\n- $b \\geq a$\n\nSo for fixed $a$, we need: $a \\leq b \\leq \\frac{2002 - a}{2}$\n\nFor this range to be non-empty: $a \\leq \\frac{2002 - a}{2}$\n- $2a \\leq 2002 - a$\n- $3a \\leq 2002$\n- $a \\leq 667.33...$\n\nSo $a$ ranges from 1 to 667.\n\nFor each valid $a$, the number of valid values of $b$ is:\n- If $2002 - a$ is even: $b$ can be $a, a+1, ..., \\frac{2002-a}{2}$, giving $\\frac{2002-a}{2} - a + 1 = \\frac{2002-a-2a+2}{2} = \\frac{2004-3a}{2}$ values\n- If $2002 - a$ is odd: $b$ can be $a, a+1, ..., \\lfloor\\frac{2002-a}{2}\\rfloor = \\frac{2001-a}{2}$, giving $\\frac{2001-a}{2} - a + 1 = \\frac{2003-3a}{2}$ values\n\nSince 2002 is even:\n- If $a$ is even, then $2002 - a$ is even, so we get $\\frac{2004-3a}{2}$ values\n- If $a$ is odd, then $2002 - a$ is odd, so we get $\\frac{2003-3a}{2}$ values\n\nThe problem asks for $e = l + 2012$ where $l$ is the terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence.\n\nFor even $a$: $a = 2, 4, 6, ..., 666$ (333 terms), each contributing $\\frac{2004-3a}{2}$\nFor odd $a$: $a = 1, 3, 5, ..., 667$ (334 terms), each contributing $\\frac{2003-3a}{2}$\n\nThe shorter sequence is the even one with 333 terms.\nThe terminal term is when $a = 666$: $l = \\frac{2004-3(666)}{2} = \\frac{2004-1998}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$\n\nTherefore: $e = l + 2012 = 3 + 2012 = 2015$\n\n## Problem 2\n\nWe need the smallest positive integer $n$ with exactly 2015 positive divisors.\n\nFirst, factor 2015: $2015 = 5 \\times 403 = 5 \\times 13 \\times 31$\n\nIf $n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, then the number of divisors is $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)\\cdots(a_k+1) = 2015 = 5 \\times 13 \\times 31$\n\nTo minimize $n$, we assign the largest exponents to the smallest primes.\n\nPossible factorizations of 2015:\n- $2015 = 2015$: $n = 2^{2014}$\n- $2015 = 5 \\times 403$: $n = 2^{402} \\times 3^4$ or $n = 2^4 \\times 3^{402}$\n- $2015 = 13 \\times 155$: $n = 2^{154} \\times 3^{12}$ or $n = 2^{12} \\times 3^{154}$\n- $2015 = 31 \\times 65$: $n = 2^{64} \\times 3^{30}$ or $n = 2^{30} \\times 3^{64}$\n- $2015 = 5 \\times 13 \\times 31$: $n = 2^{30} \\times 3^{12} \\times 5^4$\n\nThe smallest is $n = 2^{30} \\times 3^{12} \\times 5^4$.\n\nThe sum of prime factors (with multiplicity) is:\n$30 \\times 2 + 12 \\times 3 + 4 \\times 5 = 60 + 36 + 20 = 116$\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I found that expressing 2002 as an ordered sum a+b+c with a≤b≤c requires analyzing cases based on parity.
