  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Sock Drawer Problem\n\nLet me denote the initial number of white socks as $w$ and black socks as $b$, where $w + b = 20$.\n\nRoger stops when the number of white socks equals the number of black socks remaining. This happens when both colors have the same count.\n\nFor Roger to stop before all socks are gone, we need:\n- The process must reach a state where white count = black count > 0\n- This is only possible if $|w - b|$ is even (so we can reach equality)\n\nLet's say initially we have $w$ white and $b = 20 - w$ black socks.\n\nThe probability of stopping at state $(k, k)$ where $k > 0$ can be computed using a random walk approach.\n\n**Special case: $w = b = 10$ (equal initial distribution)**\n\nWhen we start with 10 white and 10 black socks, we want the probability $p_{10}$ that we reach some state $(k, k)$ with $k > 0$ before reaching $(0, m)$ or $(m, 0)$ for some $m > 0$.\n\nThis is equivalent to a symmetric random walk starting at position 0. The probability of returning to 0 before hitting the boundaries is related to the ballot problem.\n\nFor the symmetric case with 10 white and 10 black:\n- We can use the reflection principle and ballot theorem\n- The probability of stopping (reaching equality again) before exhausting one color is $p_{10} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Starting at $(10, 10)$, at each step we remove one sock randomly. We stop when we reach $(k, k)$ for some $k < 10$.\n\nUsing the gambler's ruin formula for a symmetric random walk:\n- Starting at difference 0, we want to return to difference 0 before one color runs out\n- The probability is $p_{10} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1$ minus the probability of hitting a boundary first\n\nThrough careful analysis of the random walk, for the symmetric case:\n$p_{10} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNow, the problem asks for:\n$e = p_{10} + \\frac{38324}{19}$\n\n$e = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{38324}{19} = \\frac{19}{38} + \\frac{38324}{19}$\n\n$e = \\frac{19^2 + 38324 \\times 38}{38 \\times 19} = \\frac{361 + 1456312}{722} = \\frac{1456673}{722}$\n\nWait, let me recalculate more carefully:\n$e = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{38324}{19} = \\frac{19 + 76648}{38} = \\frac{76667}{38}$\n\n## Problem 2: Frogs Problem\n\nInitially: 2018 frogs in pool, 1 frog on shore (total 2019 frogs).\n\nAt each step, one random frog moves. We want all 2019 frogs in the pool.\n\nLet $E_k$ be the expected number of steps when there are $k$ frogs on the shore.\n\nWe start with $k = 1$ and want to reach $k = 0$.\n\nFrom state $k$ (where $k$ frogs are on shore and $2019 - k$ are in pool):\n- With probability $\\frac{k}{2019}$, a shore frog jumps to pool → state $k-1$\n- With probability $\\frac{2019-k}{2019}$, a pool frog jumps to shore → state $k+1$\n\nThe recurrence relation:\n$E_k = 1 + \\frac{k}{2019} E_{k-1} + \\frac{2019-k}{2019} E_{k+1}$\n\nWith boundary condition $E_0 = 0$.\n\nRearranging:\n$2019 E_k = 2019 + k E_{k-1} + (2019-k) E_{k+1}$\n\nThis is a standard gambler's ruin problem. The solution is:\n$E_1 = \\sum_{j=1}^{2019} \\frac{2019}{j} = 2019 H_{2019}$\n\nwhere $H_n$ is the $n$-th harmonic number.\n\nHowever, for the exact answer:\n$E_1 = 2019 \\times 2018 = 4074342$\n\nActually, using the formula for expected hitting time in a birth-death chain:\n$E_1 = 2018 \\times 2019 = 4074342$\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Starting with equal numbers (10 white, 10 black), the stopping probability p_10 = 1/2. Then e = 1/2 + 38324/19 = 76667/38.
