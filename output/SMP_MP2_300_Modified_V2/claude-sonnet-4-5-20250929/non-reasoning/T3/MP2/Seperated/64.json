  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Regular Hexagon with Internal Common Tangents\n\n**Setup:**\n- Regular hexagon $P_1P_2P_3P_4P_5P_6$ with side length 2\n- Unit circles $C_i$ centered at each vertex $P_i$\n- Internal common tangents $\\ell_i$ between $C_i$ and $C_{i+2}$\n\n**Step 1: Coordinate System**\nPlace the hexagon with center at origin. For a regular hexagon with side length 2:\n- Vertices are at distance 2 from center\n- $P_k = 2(\\cos(k\\pi/3), \\sin(k\\pi/3))$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$\n\n**Step 2: Distance Between $P_i$ and $P_{i+2}$**\nIn a regular hexagon, vertices separated by 2 positions are at distance:\n$|P_i - P_{i+2}| = 2\\sqrt{3}$\n\nThis can be verified: the angle between them is $120°$, so by the law of cosines:\n$d^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 - 2(2)(2)\\cos(120°) = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12$\nThus $d = 2\\sqrt{3}$\n\n**Step 3: Internal Common Tangent**\nFor two circles of radius $r_1 = r_2 = 1$ with centers distance $d = 2\\sqrt{3}$ apart:\n- The internal common tangent crosses the line joining centers at the midpoint (since radii are equal)\n- Distance from center to tangent line: $h = \\sqrt{1^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2}$... Wait, this doesn't work.\n\nLet me reconsider. For internal common tangent of two circles with equal radii $r$ and centers distance $d$ apart:\n- The tangent line is perpendicular to the line joining centers\n- Distance from each center to the tangent is $r = 1$\n- The tangent passes through the midpoint of the segment joining centers\n\n**Step 4: Finding the Tangent Lines**\nFor circles centered at $P_i$ and $P_{i+2}$:\n- Midpoint: $M_i = (P_i + P_{i+2})/2$\n- The internal tangent is perpendicular to $P_i - P_{i+2}$ and passes through $M_i$\n\n**Step 5: Symmetry and Regular Hexagon**\nBy symmetry, the six tangent lines form a regular hexagon. The distance from the origin to each tangent line is constant.\n\nFor $P_1$ at angle $\\pi/3$ and $P_3$ at angle $\\pi$:\n- Midpoint is at distance $\\sqrt{3}$ from origin\n- The tangent line is perpendicular to the line from $P_1$ to $P_3$\n\nThe distance from origin to the tangent line equals the distance from origin to the midpoint (by symmetry and perpendicularity).\n\nDistance from origin to midpoint of $P_i$ and $P_{i+2}$:\n$|M_i| = |P_i + P_{i+2}|/2 = \\sqrt{3}$\n\nSo the inner hexagon has \"radius\" (distance from center to side) of $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFor a regular hexagon with inradius $r = \\sqrt{3}$:\n- Side length: $s = 2r/\\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt{3}/\\sqrt{3} = 2$\n- Area: $A = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}s^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 4 = 6\\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{108} = \\sqrt{108/1}$\n\nWait, let me recalculate more carefully. Area $= \\sqrt{108} = \\sqrt{108/1}$, so $a = 108, b = 1$.\nThus $k = 1$ and $e = k + 1986 = 1987$.\n\n## Problem 2: Square Numbers with Difference 1989\n\n**Setup:** Find $S_1, S_2$ such that $S_1 - S_2 = 1989$\n\nLet $S_1 = m^2$ and $S_2 = n^2$ where $m > n \\geq 0$.\n\n$m^2 - n^2 = 1989$\n$(m-n)(m+n) = 1989$\n\n**Factor 1989:**\n$1989 = 3 \\times 663 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 221 = 9 \\times 221 = 9 \\times 13 \\times 17$\n\nDivisors of 1989: 1, 3, 9, 13, 17, 39, 51, 117, 153, 221, 663, 1989\n\nFor each factorization $1989 = d_1 \\times d_2$ where $d_1 \\leq d_2$:\n- $m - n = d_1$ and $m + n = d_2$\n- $m = (d_1 + d_2)/2$ and $n = (d_2 - d_1)/2$\n- Both must be integers, so $d_1$ and $d_2$ must have same parity\n\nPairs with same parity:\n- $(1, 1989)$: $m = 995, n = 994$, so $S_1 = 990025, S_2 = 988036$\n- $(3, 663)$: $m = 333, n = 330$, so $S_1 = 110889, S_2 = 108900$\n- $(9, 221)$: $m = 115, n = 106$, so $S_1 = 13225, S_2 = 11236$\n- $(13, 153)$: $m = 83, n = 70$, so $S_1 = 6889, S_2 = 4900$\n- $(17, 117)$: $m = 67, n = 50$, so $S_1 = 4489, S_2 = 2500$\n- $(39, 51)$: $m = 45, n = 6$, so $S_1 = 2025, S_2 = 36$\n\nAll pairs: $(990025, 988036), (110889, 108900), (13225, 11236), (6889, 4900), (4489, 2500), (2025, 36)$\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, the internal common tangents form a regular hexagon with inradius √3, giving area √108 = √(108/1), so k=1 and e=1987.
