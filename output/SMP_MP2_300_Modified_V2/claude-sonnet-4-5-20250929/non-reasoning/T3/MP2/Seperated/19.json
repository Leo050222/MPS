  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nGiven information:\n- Acute triangle ABC with orthocenter H\n- D is the foot of the altitude from A\n- BD = 3, CD = 7\n- AH/HD = 5/7\n- Need to find m = HD - 3/2\n\nSince D is the foot of the altitude from A to BC, we have AD ⊥ BC.\n\nLet me set up coordinates with D at the origin, BC along the x-axis:\n- D = (0, 0)\n- B = (-3, 0)\n- C = (7, 0)\n- A = (0, h) for some h > 0\n\nSince H is on the altitude AD, we have H = (0, y_H) for some y_H.\n\nGiven AH/HD = 5/7, and since A = (0, h) and H = (0, y_H):\n- If H is between D and A: AH = h - y_H, HD = y_H\n- So (h - y_H)/y_H = 5/7\n- This gives 7(h - y_H) = 5y_H\n- 7h - 7y_H = 5y_H\n- 7h = 12y_H\n- y_H = 7h/12\n\nTherefore HD = 7h/12.\n\nNow I need to find h. The orthocenter H is the intersection of altitudes.\n\nThe altitude from B to AC has slope perpendicular to AC.\n- AC has slope (h - 0)/(0 - 7) = -h/7\n- Altitude from B has slope 7/h\n- Altitude from B passes through B = (-3, 0): y - 0 = (7/h)(x + 3)\n\nAt x = 0 (the altitude from A), we have:\ny = (7/h)(3) = 21/h\n\nSo H = (0, 21/h).\n\nFrom our earlier calculation, H = (0, 7h/12).\n\nTherefore: 21/h = 7h/12\n- 21 × 12 = 7h²\n- 252 = 7h²\n- h² = 36\n- h = 6 (taking positive value)\n\nTherefore:\n- HD = 7h/12 = 7(6)/12 = 42/12 = 7/2\n\nSo m = HD - 3/2 = 7/2 - 3/2 = 4/2 = 2.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nCompute: ∏(k=2 to 6) [(k³-1)/(k³+1)]\n\nLet me factor each term:\n- k³ - 1 = (k-1)(k² + k + 1)\n- k³ + 1 = (k+1)(k² - k + 1)\n\nSo each fraction becomes:\n(k³-1)/(k³+1) = [(k-1)(k² + k + 1)]/[(k+1)(k² - k + 1)]\n\nThe product is:\n∏(k=2 to 6) [(k-1)(k² + k + 1)]/[(k+1)(k² - k + 1)]\n\nLet me write out each term:\n- k=2: [1·7]/[3·3] = 7/9\n- k=3: [2·13]/[4·7] = 26/28 = 13/14\n- k=4: [3·21]/[5·13] = 63/65\n- k=5: [4·31]/[6·21] = 124/126 = 62/63\n- k=6: [5·43]/[7·31] = 215/217\n\nProduct of numerators: 1·2·3·4·5 × 7·13·21·31·43\nProduct of denominators: 3·4·5·6·7 × 3·7·13·21·31\n\nNotice that:\n- Numerator has: 1·2·3·4·5 and 7·13·21·31·43\n- Denominator has: 3·4·5·6·7 and 3·7·13·21·31\n\nSimplifying:\n- (1·2·3·4·5)/(3·4·5·6·7) = (1·2)/(6·7) = 2/42 = 1/21\n- (7·13·21·31·43)/(3·7·13·21·31) = 43/3\n\nTotal: (1/21) × (43/3) = 43/63\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Set up coordinates with D at origin, BC on x-axis. With B=(-3,0), C=(7,0), A=(0,h). Since H is on altitude AD at (0,y_H), and AH/HD = 5/7, we get y_H = 7h/12. Using the orthocenter property with altitude from B, we find H=(0,21/h). Equating: 21/h = 7h/12 gives h=6. Thus HD = 7/2, and m = HD - 3/2 = 2. For Problem 2: Factor k³-1 = (k-1)(k²+k+1) and k³+1 = (k+1)(k²-k+1). The product telescopes and simplifies to (1·2)/(6·7) × 43/3 = 43/63.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"43/63\"\n        }",
