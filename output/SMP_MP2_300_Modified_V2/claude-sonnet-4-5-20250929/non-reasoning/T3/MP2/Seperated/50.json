  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Farmer Bill's Animals\n\n**Given:**\n- 1000 total animals (ducks, cows, rabbits)\n- 600 ducks\n- Animals in a circle\n- Every duck must be next to at least one cow OR between two rabbits\n\n**Goal:** Find k = r - 198, where r is the number of rabbits when cows are minimized.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet's denote:\n- D = 600 ducks\n- C = number of cows\n- R = number of rabbits\n- D + C + R = 1000, so C + R = 400\n\nTo minimize cows, we want to maximize the number of ducks that are between two rabbits (not needing cows).\n\nA duck between two rabbits means a pattern RDR. To maximize such ducks:\n- We can create sequences like R-D-R-D-R-D-...-R\n- A sequence of alternating rabbits and ducks: R(DR)^k gives k ducks between rabbits using k+1 rabbits\n\nHowever, we need to be careful about the circular arrangement.\n\n**Strategy to minimize cows:**\n\nThe most efficient way is to have long chains of alternating rabbits and ducks. In a circular arrangement:\n- If we have a sequence RDRDRD...RD with n ducks and n rabbits in a cycle, all n ducks are between two rabbits.\n- But we have 600 ducks and only 400 total cows+rabbits.\n\nSince we can't have 600 rabbits, some ducks must be adjacent to cows.\n\n**Optimal arrangement:**\n\nConsider grouping ducks that need cows. Each cow can \"protect\" multiple adjacent ducks. The most efficient is to have cows separated by groups of RDR...DR patterns.\n\nIf we use R rabbits in alternating patterns with ducks:\n- In a perfect alternating circular pattern with R rabbits and R ducks, all R ducks are safe.\n- We have 600 - R ducks remaining that need cows.\n\nFor the remaining (600 - R) ducks, we need cows. The most efficient way is to place these ducks adjacent to cows. Each cow can be adjacent to multiple ducks in a row.\n\nIf we have groups of ducks next to cows: C-D-D-...-D-C, a string of m ducks needs at least 2 cows (one on each end), unless it's circular.\n\n**Better approach:**\n\nTo minimize cows, maximize rabbits in RDR patterns. With R rabbits in a circular alternating pattern with ducks, we can protect R ducks (if R ≤ 600).\n\nRemaining ducks: 600 - R\nThese need cows. In the worst case, we need one cow for every two remaining ducks (pattern: CDDC).\n\nActually, let's think differently:\n- Create maximal RDR...R chains\n- Remaining ducks are grouped with cows\n\nIf R rabbits are used optimally in alternating patterns, they protect R ducks.\nRemaining: 600 - R ducks need cows.\nWith C cows, we can protect at most 2C ducks (each cow touches 2 positions).\n\nSo: 600 - R ≤ 2C\nAnd: C + R = 400\n\nFrom C + R = 400: C = 400 - R\nSubstituting: 600 - R ≤ 2(400 - R)\n600 - R ≤ 800 - 2R\nR ≤ 200\n\nMaximum R = 200, giving C = 200.\n\nBut we want minimum C, so maximum R. With R = 200, we have C = 200.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. With R = 200 rabbits in alternating pattern with 200 ducks (RDRDRD...), we protect 200 ducks. The remaining 400 ducks need 200 cows, which checks out.\n\nTherefore: R = 200, and k = R - 198 = 200 - 198 = 2.\n\n## Problem 2: Maximum Points with Unit Distance Property\n\n**Given:** Find largest n such that for any 3 points chosen, at least 2 are unit distance apart.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis is asking for the largest set where every triple contains a unit distance pair.\n\n**Small cases:**\n- n = 3: Equilateral triangle with side 1 works.\n- n = 4: Can we add a 4th point? \n- n = 5, 6, 7: Need to check systematically.\n\n**Known result:** This is related to the unit distance graph problem. The answer is n = 7.\n\nOne configuration: vertices of a regular hexagon plus its center. All edges from center have length 1, and opposite vertices of hexagon are distance 1 apart (if hexagon has side length 1).\n\nActually, the maximum is **n = 7**, achieved by a regular hexagon with unit sides plus its center (distance 1 from each vertex).\n\nFor n = 8, it's impossible to maintain the property.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: To minimize cows, we maximize rabbits in alternating RDR patterns. With R rabbits optimally placed, they protect R ducks. The remaining (600-R) ducks need cows. With C cows and C+R=400, we need 600-R ≤ 2C. This gives R ≤ 200. At R=200, C=200, so k = 200-198 = 2. For Problem 2: The maximum is 7 points, achievable with a unit regular hexagon plus its center.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n        }",
