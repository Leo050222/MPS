  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Chessboard Probability\n\nLet me analyze the probability of having more black squares than white squares in a randomly chosen 5×5 subsquare.\n\nIn a 5×5 square, there are 25 cells total. For there to be more black squares than white squares, we need at least 13 black squares.\n\nOn a standard chessboard coloring, the parity of black vs white squares in any rectangular region depends on the position of the top-left corner.\n\nFor a 5×5 square:\n- If the top-left corner is on a black square: we get 13 black and 12 white squares\n- If the top-left corner is on a white square: we get 12 black and 13 white squares\n\nSo the probability of having more black squares equals the probability that the top-left corner is black.\n\nOn a k×k chessboard, the number of possible positions for a 5×5 subsquare is (k-4)×(k-4) = (k-4)².\n\nLet n = k-4 (the number of possible starting positions along one dimension).\n\nIn an n×n grid of possible top-left positions:\n- If n is even: exactly half the positions are black, so P = 50%\n- If n is odd: \n  - If the board starts with black in corner (1,1): we have ⌈n²/2⌉ black positions\n  - If the board starts with white in corner (1,1): we have ⌊n²/2⌋ black positions\n\nFor odd n, if corner (1,1) is black:\n- Number of black positions = (n²+1)/2\n- Probability = (n²+1)/(2n²) = 1/2 + 1/(2n²)\n\nFor this to equal 48% = 0.48 = 12/25:\n- 1/2 + 1/(2n²) = 12/25\n- 1/(2n²) = 12/25 - 1/2 = 24/50 - 25/50 = -1/50\n\nThis gives a negative value, so corner (1,1) must be white.\n\nIf corner (1,1) is white:\n- Number of black positions = (n²-1)/2\n- Probability = (n²-1)/(2n²) = 1/2 - 1/(2n²)\n\nSetting this equal to 48%:\n- 1/2 - 1/(2n²) = 12/25\n- -1/(2n²) = 12/25 - 1/2 = -1/50\n- 1/(2n²) = 1/50\n- n² = 25\n- n = 5\n\nTherefore, b = n - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2.\n\n## Problem 2: Exponential Equation\n\nWe need to find all ordered pairs (x, y) such that:\n3^x · 4^y = 2^(x+y) + 2^(2(x+y)-1)\n\nRewrite 4^y = 2^(2y):\n3^x · 2^(2y) = 2^(x+y) + 2^(2x+2y-1)\n\nFactor the right side:\n3^x · 2^(2y) = 2^(x+y)(1 + 2^(x+y-1))\n3^x · 2^(2y) = 2^(x+y)(1 + 2^(x+y-1))\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(x+y):\n3^x · 2^(2y-(x+y)) = 1 + 2^(x+y-1)\n3^x · 2^(y-x) = 1 + 2^(x+y-1)\n\nLet's try small values:\n\n**Case x = 0:**\n2^(y) = 1 + 2^(y-1)\n2^(y) = 1 + 2^(y-1)\n2^(y-1) · 2 = 1 + 2^(y-1)\n2^(y-1) = 1\ny - 1 = 0, so y = 1\n\nCheck: 3^0 · 4^1 = 4, and 2^1 + 2^1 = 4 ✓\n\n**Case x = 1:**\n3 · 2^(y-1) = 1 + 2^(y)\n3 · 2^(y-1) = 1 + 2^y\n3/2 · 2^y = 1 + 2^y\nThis gives 3/2 · 2^y - 2^y = 1\n1/2 · 2^y = 1\n2^y = 2, so y = 1\n\nCheck: 3^1 · 4^1 = 12, and 2^2 + 2^3 = 4 + 8 = 12 ✓\n\n**Case x = 2:**\n9 · 2^(y-2) = 1 + 2^(y+1)\n9/4 · 2^y = 1 + 2 · 2^y\n9/4 · 2^y - 2 · 2^y = 1\n(9/4 - 2) · 2^y = 1\n1/4 · 2^y = 1\n2^y = 4, so y = 2\n\nCheck: 3^2 · 4^2 = 9 · 16 = 144, and 2^4 + 2^7 = 16 + 128 = 144 ✓\n\nThe pattern suggests (x, y) = (x, x) works. For larger x, the left side grows much faster than the right side, so there are no more solutions.\n\nThe solutions are: (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2)\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Analyzed the probability of black squares in a 5×5 subsquare on a k×k board.
