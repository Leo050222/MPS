  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nThe problem asks me to find $d = \\gcd(8, 125) + 0$.\n\nThis is straightforward:\n- $8 = 2^3$ (the highest power of 2 dividing 1000, since $1000 = 2^3 \\times 5^3$)\n- $125 = 5^3$ (the highest power of 5 dividing 1000)\n\nSince 8 and 125 share no common prime factors:\n$$\\gcd(8, 125) = 1$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$d = 1 + 0 = 1$$\n\n## Problem 2\n\nI need to find the largest integer $n$ such that $2^n \\mid 7^{2048} - 1$.\n\nI'll use the Lifting the Exponent (LTE) lemma. For odd prime $p = 2$ (treating it specially), and odd $a = 7$:\n\nThe 2-adic valuation of $a^k - 1$ where $a$ is odd follows the formula:\n$$v_2(a^k - 1) = v_2(a - 1) + v_2(a + 1) + v_2(k) - 1$$\n\nWait, let me use the correct formula. For $a$ odd and $k$ a positive integer:\n$$v_2(a^k - 1) = v_2(a - 1) + v_2(k)$$\n\nActually, the correct LTE formula for $p = 2$ is more nuanced. Let me reconsider.\n\nFor odd $a$ and positive integer $n$:\n$$v_2(a^{2^m} - 1) = v_2(a - 1) + v_2(a + 1) + m - 1$$\n\nSince $2048 = 2^{11}$, I have:\n$$v_2(7^{2048} - 1) = v_2(7^{2^{11}} - 1)$$\n\nUsing the formula with $a = 7$ and $m = 11$:\n- $v_2(7 - 1) = v_2(6) = v_2(2 \\times 3) = 1$\n- $v_2(7 + 1) = v_2(8) = v_2(2^3) = 3$\n\nTherefore:\n$$v_2(7^{2048} - 1) = 1 + 3 + 11 - 1 = 14$$\n\nLet me verify this is the correct formula. The general LTE lemma for $p = 2$ states:\nFor odd integer $a$ and positive integer $n$:\n$$v_2(a^n - 1) = v_2(a - 1) + v_2(a + 1) + v_2(n) - 1$$\n\nWith $a = 7$ and $n = 2048 = 2^{11}$:\n- $v_2(7 - 1) = v_2(6) = 1$\n- $v_2(7 + 1) = v_2(8) = 3$\n- $v_2(2048) = v_2(2^{11}) = 11$\n\nTherefore:\n$$v_2(7^{2048} - 1) = 1 + 3 + 11 - 1 = 14$$\n\nSo the largest $n$ such that $2^n \\mid 7^{2048} - 1$ is $n = 14$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I simply calculated gcd(8, 125) = 1 since 8 = 2^3 and 125 = 5^3 share no common factors, so d = 1 + 0 = 1. For Problem 2, I used the Lifting the Exponent lemma for p = 2. For odd a and positive integer n, v_2(a^n - 1) = v_2(a-1) + v_2(a+1) + v_2(n) - 1. With a = 7 and n = 2048 = 2^11, I get v_2(7^2048 - 1) = v_2(6) + v_2(8) + v_2(2048) - 1 = 1 + 3 + 11 - 1 = 14.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"14\"\n        }",
