      "A1054": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $e = N - 86$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen."

  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nLet me understand the setup:\n- 8 different blood antigens exist\n- 256 students, each with a distinct subset of antigens (since 2^8 = 256, each student corresponds to one of the 256 possible subsets)\n- Quito picks a random subset of students and bites them in random order\n- After biting a student, Quito accumulates their antigens\n- A student suffers k hours if Quito has k antigens foreign to them when bitten\n\nThe problem asks for e = N - 86, where N is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen.\n\nSince there are 8 antigens and 256 = 2^8 students with distinct subsets:\n- For any given antigen, exactly half of the students (128 students) will have that antigen\n- The other half (128 students) won't have it\n\nSo N = 128, and e = 128 - 86 = 42.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the actual question. The problem seems to be asking about expected suffering, but then redirects to finding e = N - 86.\n\nGiven the structure where each student has a unique subset of 8 antigens:\n- N = number of students with a given antigen = 2^7 = 128 (half of all students)\n- e = 128 - 86 = 42\n\n## Problem 2\n\nLet James's three integers be a, b, and c.\n\nAlex can:\n1. Average a and b, add c: (a+b)/2 + c = 42\n2. Average a and c, add b: (a+c)/2 + b = 13\n3. Average b and c, add a: (b+c)/2 + a = 37\n\nFrom these equations:\n1. (a+b)/2 + c = 42 → a + b + 2c = 84\n2. (a+c)/2 + b = 13 → a + 2b + c = 26\n3. (b+c)/2 + a = 37 → 2a + b + c = 74\n\nLet me solve this system:\n- Equation 1: a + b + 2c = 84\n- Equation 2: a + 2b + c = 26\n- Equation 3: 2a + b + c = 74\n\nFrom (1) - (2): -b + c = 58, so c = b + 58\nFrom (3) - (2): a - b = 48, so a = b + 48\n\nSubstituting into equation 2:\n(b + 48) + 2b + (b + 58) = 26\n4b + 106 = 26\n4b = -80\nb = -20\n\nTherefore:\n- b = -20\n- a = b + 48 = 28\n- c = b + 58 = 38\n\nLet me verify:\n1. (28 + (-20))/2 + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42 ✓\n2. (28 + 38)/2 + (-20) = 33 - 20 = 13 ✓\n3. ((-20) + 38)/2 + 28 = 9 + 28 = 37 ✓\n\nThe three integers are 28, -20, and 38.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: With 8 antigens and 256 = 2^8 students each having a distinct subset, exactly half (128) students have any given antigen. Thus N = 128 and e = 128 - 86 = 42. For Problem 2: Setting up equations from the three possible results and solving the system yields a = 28, b = -20, c = 38.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"42\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"28, -20, 38\"\n        }",
