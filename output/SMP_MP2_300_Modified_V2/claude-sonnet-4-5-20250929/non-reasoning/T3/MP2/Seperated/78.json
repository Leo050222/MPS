The condition $\\lfloor \\alpha^n \\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2017}$ for ALL $n \\geq 1$ is extremely restrictive.\n\nBy Pisot-Vijayaraghavan theory, if such an $\\alpha$ exists and is irrational, it would need very special algebraic properties. The growth rate of $\\alpha^n$ and the requirement that the floor is always divisible by 2017 creates contradictions for generic irrational $\\alpha$.\n\nIn fact, for large $n$, the fractional part of $\\alpha^n$ becomes equidistributed (for most algebraic numbers), making it impossible to maintain divisibility by 2017 for all powers.\n\nThe answer is **No**, such an irrational number does not exist.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3, so Q'(x) = 2x + 2. Setting Q'(x) = 0 gives r = -1. Then Q(-1) = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2, so k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. For Problem 2: The condition that floor(α^n) ≡ 0 (mod 2017) for all n ≥ 1 is extremely restrictive. For an irrational α, the fractional parts of α^n would need to conspire in a very special way to maintain divisibility by 2017 for all powers. This is impossible due to equidistribution properties of powers of irrational numbers.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n        }",
