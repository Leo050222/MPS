The constraint is: for any two enemies, there is no person that they are both friends with.\n\nLet me think about this constraint. If persons A and B are enemies, then there cannot exist a person C such that both A-C and B-C are friends.\n\nEquivalently, if we look at the friendship graph:\n- If A and B are NOT connected by a friendship edge (they're enemies)\n- Then they cannot have a common neighbor in the friendship graph\n\nThis means the friendship graph must be a union of disjoint cliques (complete subgraphs with no edges between them).\n\nFor 5 people, the possible friendship graph structures are:\n1. No edges (all enemies) - 1 way\n2. One edge (one pair of friends, rest enemies) - but this works\n3. Two disjoint edges - this works\n4. A triangle (3-clique) - this works\n5. A triangle + isolated edge - this works\n6. A 4-clique - this works\n7. A 5-clique (all friends) - this works\n8. A 4-clique + 1 isolated vertex - this works\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The constraint is that enemies cannot share a common friend. This means the friendship graph must be a union of disjoint cliques.\n\nThe partitions of 5 into parts (representing clique sizes):\n- 5 = 5 (one 5-clique)\n- 5 = 4+1 (one 4-clique, one isolated)\n- 5 = 3+2 (one 3-clique, one 2-clique)\n- 5 = 3+1+1 (one 3-clique, two isolated)\n- 5 = 2+2+1 (two 2-cliques, one isolated)\n- 5 = 2+1+1+1 (one 2-clique, three isolated)\n- 5 = 1+1+1+1+1 (all isolated, no friends)\n\nFor each partition, count the number of ways to assign people:\n- 5: $\\binom{5}{5} / 1! = 1$\n- 4+1: $\\binom{5}{4} = 5$\n- 3+2: $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$\n- 3+1+1: $\\binom{5}{3} \\cdot \\binom{2}{1,1} / 2! = 10 \\cdot 1 = 10$\n- 2+2+1: $\\binom{5}{2} \\cdot \\binom{3}{2} / 2! = 10 \\cdot 3 / 2 = 15$\n- 2+1+1+1: $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$\n- 1+1+1+1+1: $1$\n\nTotal $s = 1 + 5 + 10 + 10 + 15 + 10 + 1 = 52$\n\nThe case where no two people are friends is the partition 1+1+1+1+1, which gives $s = 1$.\n\nTherefore, $q = s - 1 = 52 - 1 = 51$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nFind lattice points strictly inside the triangle with vertices $(0,99)$, $(5,100)$, and $(2003,500)$.\n\nUsing Pick's theorem: $A = I + \\frac{B}{2} - 1$, where $A$ is area, $I$ is interior points, $B$ is boundary points.\n\nSo $I = A - \\frac{B}{2} + 1$.\n\n**Area calculation:**\n$A = \\frac{1}{2}|x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2)|$\n$A = \\frac{1}{2}|0(100-500) + 5(500-99) + 2003(99-100)|$\n$A = \\frac{1}{2}|0 + 5(401) + 2003(-1)|$\n$A = \\frac{1}{2}|2005 - 2003| = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 = 1$\n\n**Boundary points:**\n- Edge from $(0,99)$ to $(5,100)$: $\\gcd(5-0, 100-99) + 1 = \\gcd(5,1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$\n- Edge from $(5,100)$ to $(2003,500)$: $\\gcd(2003-5, 500-100) + 1 = \\gcd(1998, 400) + 1$\n  - $\\gcd(1998, 400) = \\gcd(1998, 400) = \\gcd(398, 400) = \\gcd(398, 2) = \\gcd(0, 2) = 2$\n  - So $2 + 1 = 3$\n- Edge from $(2003,500)$ to $(0,99)$: $\\gcd(0-2003, 99-500) + 1 = \\gcd(2003, 401) + 1$\n  - $2003 = 4 \\cdot 401 + 399$, $401 = 1 \\cdot 399 + 2$, $399 = 199 \\cdot 2 + 1$\n  - $\\gcd(2003, 401) = 1$\n  - So $1 + 1 = 2$\n\n$B = 2 + 3 + 2 - 3 = 4$ (subtract 3 for the vertices counted multiple times)\n\n$I = 1 - \\frac{4}{2} + 1 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: The friendship graph must be a union of disjoint cliques.
