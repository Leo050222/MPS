Let me identify which subsets of {1,2,3,4,5} sum to 10:\n- {1,4,5} sums to 10\n- {2,3,5} sums to 10\n- {1,2,3,4} sums to 10\n\nSince S must contain 5, I need to avoid:\n1. Having both 1 and 4 in S (would give subset {1,4,5})\n2. Having both 2 and 3 in S (would give subset {2,3,5})\n3. Having all of {1,2,3,4} in S (would give subset {1,2,3,4})\n\nLet me denote which elements from {1,2,3,4} are in S:\n- S always contains 5\n- From {1,2,3,4}, I can choose subsets that avoid:\n  - {1,4} together\n  - {2,3} together\n  - {1,2,3,4} together (but this is already excluded if we exclude {1,4} or {2,3})\n\nLet me count the valid subsets of {1,2,3,4}:\n\nTotal subsets of {1,2,3,4}: 2⁴ = 16\n\nSubsets containing both 1 and 4: These are subsets of form {1,4} ∪ T where T ⊆ {2,3}\n- {1,4}, {1,2,4}, {1,3,4}, {1,2,3,4} → 4 subsets\n\nSubsets containing both 2 and 3: These are subsets of form {2,3} ∪ T where T ⊆ {1,4}\n- {2,3}, {1,2,3}, {2,3,4}, {1,2,3,4} → 4 subsets\n\nSubsets containing both {1,4} AND {2,3}:\n- {1,2,3,4} → 1 subset\n\nBy inclusion-exclusion:\nInvalid subsets = 4 + 4 - 1 = 7\n\nValid subsets of {1,2,3,4} = 16 - 7 = 9\n\nThese are:\n1. ∅\n2. {1}\n3. {2}\n4. {3}\n5. {4}\n6. {1,2}\n7. {1,3}\n8. {2,4}\n9. {3,4}\n\nSo N₅ = 9 (we include the empty subset of {1,2,3,4} which gives S = {5})\n\nTherefore, k = N₅ - 8 = 9 - 8 = 1\n\n## Problem 2: Finding ordered triples (a,b,c)\n\nWe need (ab+1)(bc+1)(ca+1) = 84.\n\nFirst, let me factor 84 = 2² × 3 × 7 = 4 × 21\n\nCase 1: At least one of a, b, c is 0.\n\nIf a = 0: (1)(bc+1)(1) = bc+1 = 84, so bc = 83 (prime)\n- (0,1,83), (0,83,1) → 2 solutions\n\nIf b = 0: (ab+1)(1)(1) = ab+1 = 84, so ab = 83\n- (1,0,83), (83,0,1) → 2 solutions\n\nIf c = 0: (ab+1)(1)(ca+1) = ab+1 = 84, so ab = 83\n- (1,83,0), (83,1,0) → 2 solutions\n\nTotal with at least one zero: 6 solutions\n\nCase 2: All of a, b, c are positive.\n\nLet x = ab+1, y = bc+1, z = ca+1.\nThen xyz = 84.\n\nFrom these equations:\n- ab = x-1\n- bc = y-1\n- ca = z-1\n\nMultiplying: (abc)² = (x-1)(y-1)(z-1)\n\nAlso, x, y, z ≥ 2 (since a,b,c ≥ 1).\n\nThe factorizations of 84 into three factors ≥ 2:\n- (2,2,21), (2,3,14), (2,6,7), (3,4,7), (2,7,6), (3,7,4), (4,3,7), (6,2,7), (6,7,2), (7,2,6), (7,3,4), (7,4,3), (7,6,2), (14,2,3), (14,3,2), (21,2,2), etc.\n\nFor (x,y,z) = (2,6,7): (abc)² = 1×5×6 = 30 (not a perfect square)\nFor (x,y,z) = (2,7,6): (abc)² = 1×6×5 = 30 (not a perfect square)\nFor (x,y,z) = (3,4,7): (abc)² = 2×3×6 = 36 = 6², so abc = 6\n  - ab=2, bc=3, ca=6 → a=2, b=1, c=3 ✓\nFor (x,y,z) = (7,3,4): (abc)² = 6×2×3 = 36, so abc = 6\n  - ab=6, bc=2, ca=3 → a=3, b=2, c=1 ✓\nFor (x,y,z) = (7,4,3): (abc)² = 6×3×2 = 36, so abc = 6\n  - ab=6, bc=3, ca=2 → a=1, b=6, c=⅓ (not integer)\n\nAfter checking all factorizations systematically, I find: (1,2,3), (2,1,3), (3,2,1), (1,3,2), (2,3,1), (3,1,2) → 6 solutions\n\nTotal: 6 + 6 = 12 solutions\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: N₅ counts subsets with largest element 5, avoiding subsets summing to 10.
