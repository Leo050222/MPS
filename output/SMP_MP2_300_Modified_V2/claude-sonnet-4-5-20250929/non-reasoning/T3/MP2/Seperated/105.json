If $S_{n-1}$ is divisible by $p$ or becomes such that the largest prime divisor remains $p$, the sequence stabilizes.\n\nAfter $a_8 = 23$, we get $S_n = S_7 + 23(n-7) = 23 + 23(n-7) = 23(n-6)$ for $n \\geq 7$.\n\nFor $n = 99$: $S_{99} = 23(99-6) = 23 \\times 93 = 23 \\times 3 \\times 31 = 2139$\n\nThe largest prime divisor of $2139 = 3 \\times 23 \\times 31$ is $31$.\n\nSo $a_{100} = 31$.\n\nThe two consecutive terms before $a_{100}$ are $a_{98} = 23$ and $a_{99} = 23$.\n\nTherefore, $m = a_{98} + a_{99} = 23 + 23 = 46$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nAlice starts at 0 and can perform 100 operations: add 1 or square.\n\nTo maximize the distance to the nearest perfect square, I need to find a strategy.\n\nIf Alice reaches number $n$, the distance to the nearest perfect square is $\\min(n - k^2, (k+1)^2 - n)$ where $k = \\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor$.\n\nThe maximum distance occurs at the midpoint between consecutive perfect squares, i.e., around $k^2 + k$.\n\nStrategy: Build up to a large perfect square, then add to get halfway to the next one.\n\nWith 100 operations, if we use $s$ squaring operations and $a$ additions where $s + a = 100$:\n- Starting from 0, one addition gives 1\n- Squaring $s$ times: $1 \\to 1 \\to 1 \\to ...$, so we need additions between squares\n\nBetter strategy: $0 \\xrightarrow{+1} 1 \\xrightarrow{+1} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\text{square}} 4 \\xrightarrow{+1} 5 \\xrightarrow{\\text{square}} 25 \\xrightarrow{+1} 26 \\xrightarrow{\\text{square}} 676$\n\nWith 3 squares and 3 additions (6 operations), we reach 676.\n\nContinuing: $676 \\xrightarrow{+1} 677 \\xrightarrow{\\text{square}} 458329$\n\nWith 4 squares and 4 additions (8 operations), we reach $458329 = 677^2$.\n\nThe next square is $678^2 = 459684$. Distance = $459684 - 458329 = 1355$.\n\nWith remaining 92 operations as additions: $458329 + 92 = 458421$.\n\nDistance to $677^2 = 458329$ is 92.\nDistance to $678^2 = 459684$ is $459684 - 458421 = 1263$.\n\nMinimum distance = 92.\n\nLet me try: $677^2 + 677 = 458329 + 677 = 459006$ (midpoint).\nThis requires $8 + 677 = 685$ operations, too many.\n\nWith 100 operations optimally: After reaching $677^2$ with 8 operations, add 92 more.\nScore = min(92, 1263) = 92.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I traced the sequence and found it stabilizes at 23 for most terms, but a_{100}=31 based on the sum formula. The two preceding terms are both 23, giving m=46.
