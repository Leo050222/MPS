Let me work with what's provided about $f^{24}(18) \\pmod{89}$.\n\nGiven $f(x) = x^2 - 2$, I need to compute $f^{24}(18) \\pmod{89}$.\n\nLet me iterate:\n- $f^1(18) = 18^2 - 2 = 324 - 2 = 322 \\equiv 322 - 3(89) = 322 - 267 = 55 \\pmod{89}$\n- $f^2(18) = 55^2 - 2 = 3025 - 2 = 3023 \\equiv 3023 - 33(89) = 3023 - 2937 = 86 \\pmod{89}$\n- $f^3(18) = 86^2 - 2 = 7396 - 2 = 7394 \\equiv 7394 - 83(89) = 7394 - 7387 = 7 \\pmod{89}$\n- $f^4(18) = 7^2 - 2 = 49 - 2 = 47 \\pmod{89}$\n- $f^5(18) = 47^2 - 2 = 2209 - 2 = 2207 \\equiv 2207 - 24(89) = 2207 - 2136 = 71 \\pmod{89}$\n- $f^6(18) = 71^2 - 2 = 5041 - 2 = 5039 \\equiv 5039 - 56(89) = 5039 - 4984 = 55 \\pmod{89}$\n\nNotice that $f^6(18) \\equiv 55 \\equiv f^1(18) \\pmod{89}$, so the sequence is periodic with period 5 starting from $f^1(18)$.\n\nSince $24 = 1 + 23 = 1 + 4 \\cdot 5 + 3$, we have $f^{24}(18) \\equiv f^{4}(18) \\equiv 47 \\pmod{89}$.\n\nIf $L_8 = 47$, then $d = L_8 - 42 = 47 - 42 = 5$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nWe need to count degree-5 polynomials with real coefficients that permute $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.\n\nA polynomial $p(x)$ of degree 5 that sends $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ to a permutation of itself must satisfy:\n- $p$ maps each of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ bijectively to $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$\n\nFor a degree-5 polynomial with real coefficients, if it permutes a 6-element set, we can write:\n$$p(x) = a_5x^5 + a_4x^4 + a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$\n\nGiven 6 points $(1,\\sigma(1)), (2,\\sigma(2)), \\ldots, (6,\\sigma(6))$ where $\\sigma$ is a permutation of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$, there exists a unique polynomial of degree at most 5 passing through these points (by Lagrange interpolation).\n\nHowever, we need this polynomial to have degree *exactly* 5. The polynomial has degree exactly 5 if and only if the leading coefficient $a_5 \\neq 0$.\n\nUsing Lagrange interpolation, the polynomial through the 6 points has degree at most 5. It has degree exactly 5 unless the 6 points lie on a polynomial of degree at most 4.\n\nFor generic permutations, the polynomial will have degree exactly 5. The polynomial has degree less than 5 only when the permutation satisfies special conditions.\n\nThe number of permutations where the interpolating polynomial has degree exactly 5 equals the total number of permutations minus those where the degree is at most 4.\n\nBy a counting argument, the number of permutations of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ such that the interpolating polynomial has degree at most 4 is at most $6^5$ (choosing 5 values freely, the 6th is determined). But this overcounts significantly.\n\nActually, for a polynomial of degree at most 4 to permute 6 elements is impossible (by the pigeonhole principle applied to polynomial behavior).\n\nTherefore, all $6! = 720$ permutations give polynomials of degree exactly 5.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I computed iterations of f(x)=x²-2 starting from 18 modulo 89, finding a period of 5. For f^24(18), this gives 47 mod 89. If L_8=47, then d=5. For Problem 2, by Lagrange interpolation, each permutation of {1,2,3,4,5,6} determines a unique polynomial of degree at most 5. Since we have 6 points, generically the degree is exactly 5, giving 6!=720 polynomials.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"720\"\n        }",
