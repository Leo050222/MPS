Instead of determining the distance before crossing another circle, simply find $k = d - 6$, where $d$ is the distance to the next circle crossing derived from the geometric analysis of the straight-line trajectory relative to the concentric circles."

If $d = \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}$, then $k = \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5} - 6 \\approx -5.1$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nA restricted path from $(0,0)$ to $(7,3)$ has length $n = 7 + 3 = 10$.\n\nRestriction: If step $i$ is Up (for $i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 8\\}$), then step $i+1$ must be Right.\n\nThis means: U must be followed by R (except possibly the last step).\n\nWe need 7 R's and 3 U's. Each U (except possibly the last) must be followed by R.\n\nIf all 3 U's are followed by R, we use 3 U's and at least 3 R's for \"UR\" pairs, leaving 4 R's to place.\n\nWe have blocks: UR, UR, UR, and 4 additional R's.\n\nWe need to arrange these 7 objects, which gives $\\binom{7}{3} = 35$ ways.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, analyzing the geometric pattern of circle crossings with distances $\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}}{5}$, $\\\\sqrt{5}$, and $\\\\frac{3\\\\sqrt{5}}{5}$, the next crossing distance follows the pattern giving $d = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{5}}{5}$, so $k = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{5}}{5} - 6$. For Problem 2, with the restriction that U must be followed by R (except possibly at the end), we treat each U as part of a UR block. With 3 U's and 7 R's total, we have 3 UR blocks and 4 additional R's, giving us 7 objects to arrange.
