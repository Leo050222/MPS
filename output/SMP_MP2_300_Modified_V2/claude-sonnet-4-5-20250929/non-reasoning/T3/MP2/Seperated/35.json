      "A745": "Alice is sitting in a teacup ride with infinitely many layers of spinning disks. The largest disk has radius 5. Each succeeding disk has its center attached to a point on the circumference of the previous disk and has a radius equal to $2 / 3$ of the previous disk. Each disk spins around its center (relative to the disk it is attached to) at a rate of \\pi / 6$ radians per second. Initially, at $t=0$, the centers of the disks are aligned on a single line, going outward. Alice is sitting at the limit point of all these disks. After 12 seconds, what is the length of the trajectory that Alice has traced out? Instead of computing the total path length traversed by the limit point, simply find $k = r - 7$, where $r$ is the radius of the trajectory traced by that limit point."

The radius of the trajectory is:\n$$|z(t)| = \\left|\\frac{5e^{i\\omega t}}{1 - \\frac{2}{3}e^{i\\omega t}}\\right|$$\n\nLet $w = e^{i\\omega t}$, so $|w| = 1$.\n\n$$|z(t)| = \\frac{5|w|}{|1 - \\frac{2}{3}w|} = \\frac{5}{|1 - \\frac{2}{3}w|}$$\n\nFor $w = e^{i\\theta}$:\n$$|1 - \\frac{2}{3}e^{i\\theta}|^2 = (1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\cos\\theta)^2 + (\\frac{2}{3}\\sin\\theta)^2$$\n$$= 1 - \\frac{4}{3}\\cos\\theta + \\frac{4}{9}\\cos^2\\theta + \\frac{4}{9}\\sin^2\\theta$$\n$$= 1 - \\frac{4}{3}\\cos\\theta + \\frac{4}{9}$$\n$$= \\frac{13}{9} - \\frac{4}{3}\\cos\\theta$$\n\nThe radius varies between:\n- Maximum when $\\cos\\theta = -1$: $|z|_{max} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{13/9 + 4/3}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{25/9}} = \\frac{5}{5/3} = 3$\n- Minimum when $\\cos\\theta = 1$: $|z|_{min} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{13/9 - 4/3}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{1/9}} = \\frac{5}{1/3} = 15$\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The trajectory is actually a circle. The center and radius need to be found properly.\n\nActually, $z(t) = \\frac{5e^{i\\omega t}}{1 - \\frac{2}{3}e^{i\\omega t}}$ traces a circle. The radius of this circular trajectory is:\n\n$$r = \\frac{5 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}}{|1 - (\\frac{2}{3})^2|} = \\frac{10/3}{1 - 4/9} = \\frac{10/3}{5/9} = \\frac{10}{3} \\cdot \\frac{9}{5} = 6$$\n\nTherefore, $k = r - 7 = 6 - 7 = -1$\n\n## Problem 2: Melody's Moves\n\n**Setup:**\n- Start with 770\n- Subtract 40 or 41 each move\n- Stop when number ≤ 0\n- Count sequences\n\n**Analysis:**\nIf Melody makes $m$ moves total, subtracting $x_i \\in \\{40, 41\\}$ at move $i$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^m x_i > 770 \\text{ and } \\sum_{i=1}^{m-1} x_i \\leq 770$$\n\nThe minimum sum for $m$ moves is $40m$ and maximum is $41m$.\n- Need $40m \\leq 770 < 41m$ or $40(m-1) \\leq 770 < 40m$\n\nFrom $770 < 41m$: $m > 18.78$, so $m \\geq 19$\nFrom $40m \\leq 770$: $m \\leq 19.25$, so $m \\leq 19$\n\nTherefore $m = 19$ moves.\n\nAfter 19 moves, the sum must be in $(770, 779]$ (since $40 \\cdot 19 = 760$ and $41 \\cdot 19 = 779$).\n\nLet $k$ be the number of times we subtract 41. Then:\n$$760 + k > 770$$\n$$k > 10$$\n\nSo $k \\in \\{11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19\\}$ (9 values)\n\nFor each valid $k$, the number of sequences is $\\binom{19}{k}$.\n\n$$N = \\sum_{k=11}^{19} \\binom{19}{k} = \\sum_{k=11}^{19} \\binom{19}{k}$$\n\nBy symmetry: $\\sum_{k=0}^{19} \\binom{19}{k} = 2^{19}$\n\n$$N = \\sum_{k=11}^{19} \\binom{19}{k} = \\frac{2^{19} - \\binom{19}{10}}{2} + \\frac{\\binom{19}{10}}{2} = 2^{18} - \\frac{\\binom{19}{10}}{2}$$\n\nWait, let me recalculate: $\\binom{19}{10} = 92378$\n\nActually: $N = \\sum_{k=11}^{19} \\binom{19}{k} = 2^{18} = 262144$\n\nSince $\\binom{19}{10} = 92378$ is even, we have:\n$$N = 2^{18} = 262144 = 262144 \\cdot 2^0$$\n\nSo $a = 131072$ (odd) and $b = 1$... Let me recalculate.\n\n$N = 2^{18} - \\binom{19}{10}/2 = 262144 - 46189 = 215955 = 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 14397 = 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4799 = 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4799 = 45 \\cdot 4799 = 215955$\n\n$215955 = 215955 \\cdot 2^0$, so $a = 215955$, $b = 0$\n\nAnswer: $100a + b = 21595500$\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I analyzed the infinite series of rotating disks to find that Alice traces a circular trajectory with radius 6, giving k = -1.
