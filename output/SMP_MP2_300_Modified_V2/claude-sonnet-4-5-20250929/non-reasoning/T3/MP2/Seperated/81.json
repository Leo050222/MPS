  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nThe function is $y = x + \\frac{1}{x}$.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. The problem mentions finding lines of symmetry, but then asks for something different: finding $e = k + 1039$ where $k$ is the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote parallel to the y-axis.\n\nFor $y = x + \\frac{1}{x}$:\n- As $x \\to 0$, $y \\to \\pm\\infty$\n- The vertical asymptote is at $x = 0$\n\nThe equation of the vertical asymptote is $x = 0$, which can be written as $1 \\cdot x + 0 \\cdot y = 0$.\n\nThe coefficient vector is $(1, 0)$.\nThe Euclidean norm is $k = \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 1$.\n\nTherefore, $e = k + 1039 = 1 + 1039 = 1040$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nWe have the system:\n- $x^2 y + y^2 z = 1040$ ... (1)\n- $x^2 z + z^2 y = 260$ ... (2)\n- $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) = -540$ ... (3)\n\nFrom equations (1) and (2):\n$x^2 y + y^2 z = 1040$\n$x^2 z + z^2 y = 260$\n\nFactor: $y(x^2 + yz) = 1040$ and $z(x^2 + yz) = 260$\n\nDividing: $\\frac{y}{z} = \\frac{1040}{260} = 4$\n\nSo $y = 4z$.\n\nSubstituting into equation (2):\n$x^2 z + z^2(4z) = 260$\n$x^2 z + 4z^3 = 260$\n$z(x^2 + 4z^2) = 260$ ... (4)\n\nSubstituting $y = 4z$ into equation (1):\n$x^2(4z) + (4z)^2 z = 1040$\n$4x^2 z + 16z^3 = 1040$\n$4z(x^2 + 4z^2) = 1040$\n$z(x^2 + 4z^2) = 260$ ... (5)\n\nThis confirms our relation. From (4): $x^2 + 4z^2 = \\frac{260}{z}$\n\nSo $x^2 = \\frac{260}{z} - 4z^2 = \\frac{260 - 4z^3}{z}$ ... (6)\n\nNow using equation (3) with $y = 4z$:\n$(x - 4z)(4z - z)(z - x) = -540$\n$(x - 4z)(3z)(z - x) = -540$\n$3z(x - 4z)(z - x) = -540$\n$z(x - 4z)(z - x) = -180$\n$z[(x - 4z)(z - x)] = -180$\n$z[xz - x^2 - 4z^2 + 4xz] = -180$\n$z[5xz - x^2 - 4z^2] = -180$ ... (7)\n\nFrom (6): $x^2 = \\frac{260 - 4z^3}{z}$\n\nSubstituting into (7):\n$z[5xz - \\frac{260 - 4z^3}{z} - 4z^2] = -180$\n$5xz^2 - (260 - 4z^3) - 4z^3 = -180$\n$5xz^2 - 260 + 4z^3 - 4z^3 = -180$\n$5xz^2 = 80$\n$xz^2 = 16$\n$x = \\frac{16}{z^2}$ ... (8)\n\nSubstituting (8) into (6):\n$\\frac{256}{z^4} = \\frac{260 - 4z^3}{z}$\n$\\frac{256}{z^3} = 260 - 4z^3$\n$256 = 260z^3 - 4z^6$\n$4z^6 - 260z^3 + 256 = 0$\n$z^6 - 65z^3 + 64 = 0$\n\nLet $u = z^3$:\n$u^2 - 65u + 64 = 0$\n$(u - 1)(u - 64) = 0$\n\nSo $z^3 = 1$ or $z^3 = 64$\nThus $z = 1$ or $z = 4$.\n\nFor $z = 1$: $x = 16$, $y = 4$\nFor $z = 4$: $x = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$, $y = 16$\n\nVerification shows both solutions work: $(16, 4, 1)$ and $(1, 16, 4)$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, the vertical asymptote of y=x+1/x is x=0, with coefficient vector (1,0) having Euclidean norm 1, so e=1+1039=1040. For Problem 2, using y=4z from the ratio of first two equations, and substituting into the third equation yields z=1 or z=4, giving solutions (16,4,1) and (1,16,4).\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"1040\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"(16, 4, 1) and (1, 16, 4)\"\n        }",
