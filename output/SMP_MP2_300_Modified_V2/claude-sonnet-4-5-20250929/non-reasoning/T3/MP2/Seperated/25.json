      "A401": "Trevor and Edward play a game in which they take turns adding or removing beans from a pile. On each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. The player who empties the pile wins. For example, if Trevor goes first with a pile of 5 beans, he can either add 4 to make the total 9, or remove 4 to make the total 1, and either way Edward wins by removing all the beans. There is no limit to how large the pile can grow; it just starts with some finite number of beans in it, say fewer than 1000. Before the game begins, Edward dispatches a spy to find out how many beans will be in the opening pile, call this $n$, then \"graciously\" offers to let Trevor go first. Knowing that the first player is more likely to win, but not knowing $n$, Trevor logically but unwisely accepts, and Edward goes on to win the game. Find a number $n$ less than 1000 that would prompt this scenario, assuming both players are perfect logicians. A correct answer is worth the nearest integer to $\\log _{2}(n-4)$ points. Instead of finding an initial pile size $n$ less than 1000 that is a losing position for the first player under perfect play, simply find $k = s(p) - 6$, where $p$ is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example, and $s(p)$ is the largest perfect square at most $p$."

The problem asks me to find $k = s(p) - 6$, where:\n- $p$ is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square to the initial pile in the example\n- $s(p)$ is the largest perfect square at most $p$\n\nIn the example:\n- Initial pile: $n = 5$ beans\n- Largest perfect square ≤ 5 is $4$\n- Trevor can add 4 to make $p = 9$\n- $s(p) = s(9) = 9$ (largest perfect square ≤ 9)\n- Therefore: $k = s(p) - 6 = 9 - 6 = 3$\n\n## Problem 2\n\nI need to count distinct colorings of a tetrahedron's vertices with 3 colors (red, blue, green) such that no face is monochromatic, where two colorings are the same if related by rotation.\n\n**Step 1: Count total valid colorings without considering rotations**\n\nA tetrahedron has 4 vertices and 4 faces. Each face is a triangle with 3 vertices.\n\nTotal colorings: $3^4 = 81$\n\nInvalid colorings (at least one monochromatic face):\n- Let $A_i$ = colorings where face $i$ is monochromatic\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n- $|A_i|$: Fix one face to be monochromatic (3 color choices), the 4th vertex can be any color: $3 \\times 3 = 9$\n- $|A_i \\cap A_j|$: Two faces share an edge (2 vertices). If both are monochromatic, all 4 vertices must be the same color: 3 colorings\n- $|A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k|$: Three faces force all vertices the same: 3 colorings\n- $|A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap A_3 \\cap A_4|$: All same color: 3 colorings\n\nBy inclusion-exclusion:\n$|A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 \\cup A_4| = 4(9) - \\binom{4}{2}(3) + \\binom{4}{3}(3) - 3$\n$= 36 - 18 + 12 - 3 = 27$\n\nValid colorings: $81 - 27 = 54$\n\n**Step 2: Apply Burnside's lemma**\n\nThe rotation group of a tetrahedron has 12 elements:\n- 1 identity\n- 8 rotations by 120° and 240° around axes through vertices (2 rotations × 4 axes)\n- 3 rotations by 180° around axes through edge midpoints\n\nFor each rotation, count fixed colorings:\n\n**Identity**: All 54 valid colorings are fixed.\n\n**Rotations around vertex** (8 rotations): \nA 120° or 240° rotation around a vertex fixes that vertex and cycles the other 3.\nFor a coloring to be fixed, the 3 cycling vertices must have the same color.\n- If all 4 vertices same color: invalid (monochromatic faces)\n- If apex different from base (all same): Check validity\n  - 3 color choices for apex, 2 for base (different from apex): 6 colorings\n  - Each creates a monochromatic base face: invalid\n\nSo 0 fixed colorings for these rotations.\n\n**Rotations by 180° around edge midpoints** (3 rotations):\nThis swaps two pairs of opposite vertices.\nFor a coloring to be fixed: vertices in each pair must have the same color.\n- Pattern: $(a, a, b, b)$ where vertices 1,2 have color $a$ and vertices 3,4 have color $b$\n- Total: $3 \\times 3 = 9$ colorings\n- Check validity: Need to ensure no face is monochromatic\n  - Each face has 2 vertices from one pair and 1 from the other\n  - Face is monochromatic only if $a = b$\n  - So we need $a \\neq b$: $3 \\times 2 = 6$ valid colorings\n\n**Apply Burnside's lemma**:\nNumber of distinct colorings = $\\frac{1}{12}(54 + 0 \\times 8 + 6 \\times 3) = \\frac{54 + 18}{12} = \\frac{72}{12} = 6$\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I identified that in the example with initial pile n=5, Trevor can add 4 beans to make p=9.

First, I found 54 valid colorings without symmetry (81 total minus 27 with monochromatic faces). Then I counted fixed points under each rotation: identity fixes all 54, vertex rotations fix 0, and edge rotations fix 6 each.
