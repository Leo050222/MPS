  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nWe need to find positive integers $a$ such that $x^2 - ax + a$ has an integer root.\n\nLet $r$ be an integer root. Then:\n$$r^2 - ar + a = 0$$\n$$r^2 = ar - a = a(r-1)$$\n$$a = \\frac{r^2}{r-1}$$\n\nFor $a$ to be a positive integer, we need:\n1. $r \\neq 1$ (to avoid division by zero)\n2. $(r-1) | r^2$\n\nLet me rewrite: $r^2 = r \\cdot r = (r-1+1) \\cdot r = r(r-1) + r$\n\nSo: $a = \\frac{r^2}{r-1} = \\frac{r(r-1) + r}{r-1} = r + \\frac{r}{r-1}$\n\nFor $a$ to be an integer, we need $(r-1) | r$.\n\nSince $r = (r-1) + 1$, we have $(r-1) | r$ if and only if $(r-1) | 1$.\n\nThis means $r-1 \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$, so $r \\in \\{0, 2\\}$.\n\nLet me check:\n- If $r = 0$: $a = \\frac{0}{-1} = 0$ (not positive)\n- If $r = 2$: $a = \\frac{4}{1} = 4$ (positive!)\n\nLet me verify: $x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2$, which has root $x = 2$. ✓\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I should check negative values of $r$ too.\n\nIf $r < 0$, then for $a > 0$, we need $r^2 > 0$ and $r - 1 < 0$, so $a = \\frac{r^2}{r-1} < 0$. This won't work.\n\nIf $r > 1$, then both $r^2 > 0$ and $r-1 > 0$, so $a > 0$. We need $(r-1) | r^2$.\n\nActually, let me be more systematic. We have $r^2 = a(r-1)$, which gives us:\n$$r^2 = ar - a$$\n$$r^2 - r = ar - a - r = a(r-1) - r$$\n$$r(r-1) = a(r-1) - r$$\n\nIf $r = 1$: undefined.\nIf $r \\neq 1$: $a = \\frac{r^2}{r-1} = \\frac{r^2 - r + r}{r-1} = r + \\frac{r}{r-1}$\n\nFor integer $a$, we need $(r-1) | r$. Since $\\gcd(r, r-1) = 1$, we need $(r-1) | 1$, giving $r \\in \\{0, 2\\}$.\n\nOnly $r = 2$ gives positive $a = 4$.\n\nSo there's only **one** positive integer $a = 4$.\n\nTherefore, $k = a + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nLet $p_i$ be the probability that a die shows $i$ (for $i = 1, 2, ..., 6$).\n\nGiven:\n- $P(\\text{sum} = 2) = p_1 \\cdot p_1 = p_1^2 = 0.04$, so $p_1 = 0.2$\n- $P(\\text{sum} = 12) = p_6 \\cdot p_6 = p_6^2 = 0.01$, so $p_6 = 0.1$\n\nThe sum equals 7 when: $(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)$\n\n$$P(\\text{sum} = 7) = 2(p_1p_6 + p_2p_5 + p_3p_4)$$\n$$= 2(0.2 \\cdot 0.1 + p_2p_5 + p_3p_4)$$\n$$= 2(0.02 + p_2p_5 + p_3p_4)$$\n$$= 0.04 + 2(p_2p_5 + p_3p_4)$$\n\nWe have the constraint: $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 = 1$\n$$0.2 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + 0.1 = 1$$\n$$p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 0.7$$\n\nTo maximize $p_2p_5 + p_3p_4$ subject to $p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 0.7$, by AM-GM inequality:\n$$p_2p_5 \\leq \\frac{(p_2 + p_5)^2}{4}$$\n$$p_3p_4 \\leq \\frac{(p_3 + p_4)^2}{4}$$\n\nLet $s = p_2 + p_5$ and $t = p_3 + p_4$. Then $s + t = 0.7$.\n\nWe want to maximize $f(s,t) = \\frac{s^2}{4} + \\frac{t^2}{4} = \\frac{s^2 + t^2}{4}$.\n\nGiven $s + t = 0.7$, we have $s^2 + t^2 = s^2 + (0.7-s)^2 = 2s^2 - 1.4s + 0.49$.\n\nThis is maximized when $s = 0$ or $s = 0.7$ (at the boundary).\n\nMaximum: $\\frac{0.49}{4} = 0.1225$\n\nTherefore: $P(\\text{sum} = 7) \\leq 0.04 + 2(0.1225) = 0.04 + 0.245 = 0.285$\n\nSo $\\lfloor 100p \\rfloor = \\lfloor 28.5 \\rfloor = 28$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I found that x^2 - ax + a has an integer root r when a = r^2/(r-1). For a to be a positive integer, (r-1) must divide r, which only happens when r = 2, giving a = 4. Thus k = a + 7 = 11. For Problem 2, with p_1 = 0.2 and p_6 = 0.1, I maximized P(sum=7) = 0.04 + 2(p_2*p_5 + p_3*p_4) subject to p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 0.7. The maximum occurs at the boundary, giving p = 0.285, so floor(100p) = 28.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"28\"\n        }",
