(4)\nFrom (3) - (2): $5a + b = 5$ ... (5)\nFrom (5) - (4): $2a = 2$, so $a = 1$\n\nSubstituting into (4): $3 + b = 3$, so $b = 0$\n\nSubstituting into (1): $1 + 0 + c = -4$, so $c = -5$\n\nTherefore, $R(x) = x^2 - 5$.\n\nLet me verify:\n- $R(1) = 1 - 5 = -4$ ✓\n- $R(2) = 4 - 5 = -1$ ✓\n- $R(3) = 9 - 5 = 4$ ✓\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Found that n = 2025 = 45^2, and adding 1 to each digit gives 3136 = 56^2.
