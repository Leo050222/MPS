      "A3077": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$."

  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nGiven:\n- Ratio of skateboards to bicycles is 7:4\n- There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles\n- Need to find d = k + 6, where k is the scaling factor\n\nLet the scaling factor be k.\n- Number of skateboards = 7k\n- Number of bicycles = 4k\n\nSince there were 12 more skateboards than bicycles:\n7k - 4k = 12\n3k = 12\nk = 4\n\nTherefore:\nd = k + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n## Problem 2\n\nInitial candies:\n- Red: 10\n- Yellow: 7\n- Blue: 3\n\nAfter eating some candies, equal numbers of each color remain.\n\nLet's say x candies of each color remain after eating.\n\nConstraints:\n- x ≤ 3 (since we only have 3 blue candies to start)\n- Red candies eaten: 10 - x\n- Yellow candies eaten: 7 - x\n- Blue candies eaten: 3 - x\n\nTotal candies eaten = (10 - x) + (7 - x) + (3 - x) = 20 - 3x\n\nTo minimize the number of candies eaten, we need to maximize x.\n\nSince x ≤ 3 (limited by blue candies), the maximum value of x is 3.\n\nWhen x = 3:\n- Red candies eaten: 10 - 3 = 7\n- Yellow candies eaten: 7 - 3 = 4\n- Blue candies eaten: 3 - 3 = 0\n- Total eaten: 7 + 4 + 0 = 11\n\nLet me verify: After eating, we have 3 red, 3 yellow, and 3 blue candies remaining. ✓\n\nThe smallest possible number of candies eaten is 11.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Using the ratio 7:4 with scaling factor k, we have 7k skateboards and 4k bicycles. Since there are 12 more skateboards than bicycles, 7k - 4k = 12, giving us 3k = 12, so k = 4. Therefore d = k + 6 = 10. For Problem 2: Starting with 10 red, 7 yellow, and 3 blue candies, to have equal numbers remaining, we're limited by the smallest quantity (3 blue). To minimize candies eaten, we maximize what remains. The maximum equal amount is 3 of each color, requiring eating 7 red, 4 yellow, and 0 blue candies, totaling 11 candies.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n        }",
