  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\n**Given:**\n- Cube has edge length 30\n- Rectangular solid has edge lengths 20, 30, and L\n- They have equal surface areas\n- Find h = S - 5397, where S is the surface area of the cube\n\n**Step 1: Find the surface area of the cube**\n\nA cube has 6 faces, each with area = (edge length)²\n\nSurface area of cube: S = 6 × 30² = 6 × 900 = 5400\n\n**Step 2: Calculate h**\n\nh = S - 5397 = 5400 - 5397 = 3\n\nNote: The problem asks us to find h = S - 5397, not to find L. So we don't need to use the equal surface area condition with the rectangular solid.\n\n## Problem 2\n\n**Given:**\n- Original line: y = x\n- Translated 3 units right and 2 units down\n- Find the y-intercept of the resulting line\n\n**Step 1: Understand the translation**\n\nWhen a line is translated:\n- 3 units to the right: replace x with (x - 3)\n- 2 units down: subtract 2 from y\n\n**Step 2: Apply the transformation**\n\nOriginal equation: y = x\n\nAfter translation 3 units right: y = (x - 3)\nAfter translation 2 units down: y = (x - 3) - 2\n\nSimplified: y = x - 3 - 2 = x - 5\n\n**Step 3: Find the y-intercept**\n\nThe y-intercept occurs when x = 0:\ny = 0 - 5 = -5\n\nTherefore, the y-intercept is -5.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: The surface area of a cube with edge length 30 is S = 6 × 30² = 5400. Therefore h = S - 5397 = 5400 - 5397 = 3. For Problem 2: Translating y = x three units right gives y = (x-3), and translating 2 units down gives y = (x-3) - 2 = x - 5. The y-intercept is found by setting x = 0, giving y = -5.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"-5\"\n        }",
