Therefore k = |S| + 2016 = 5 + 2016 = 2021. For Problem 2: From 45a + b = 2021, we get b = 2021 - 45a. For b to be positive, a < 2021/45 ≈ 44.91, so a ≤ 44. We have a + b = 2021 - 44a, which decreases as a increases. To minimize a + b, we maximize a. With a = 44, we get b = 41, giving a + b = 85.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"2021\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"85\"\n        }",
