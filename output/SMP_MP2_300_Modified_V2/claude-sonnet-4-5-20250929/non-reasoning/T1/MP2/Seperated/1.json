If 10 of the smaller cubes are red, 9 are blue, and 8 are yellow, what is the smallest possible surface area of the larger cube that is red? Instead of determining the minimal total exposed face area contributed by the red small cubes on the surface of the assembled large cube, simply find $d = n + 20$, where $n$ is the number of red small cubes placed in positions exposing three faces in the assembly that achieves this minimum."

First, place red cubes in the center (0 faces exposed): 1 cube\n2. Then, place red cubes on face centers (1 face exposed): 6 cubes\n3. Then, place red cubes on edges (2 faces exposed): 3 more cubes (since we have 10 red cubes total)\n\nSo the optimal placement is:\n- 1 red cube at center (0 faces)\n- 6 red cubes at face centers (6 faces total)\n- 3 red cubes at edges (6 faces total)\n- Total red surface area: 0 + 6 + 6 = 12 square units\n\nNumber of red cubes at corner positions (exposing 3 faces): **n = 0**\n\nTherefore, **d = n + 20 = 0 + 20 = 20**\n\n## Problem 2: Finding the Tens Digit of LCM(20, 16, 2016)\n\nFirst, I'll find the prime factorizations:\n- 20 = 2² × 5\n- 16 = 2⁴\n- 2016 = ?\n\nLet me factor 2016:\n- 2016 ÷ 2 = 1008\n- 1008 ÷ 2 = 504\n- 504 ÷ 2 = 252\n- 252 ÷ 2 = 126\n- 126 ÷ 2 = 63\n- 63 ÷ 3 = 21\n- 21 ÷ 3 = 7\n- 7 is prime\n\nSo 2016 = 2⁵ × 3² × 7\n\nThe LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime:\n- LCM(20, 16, 2016) = 2⁵ × 3² × 5 × 7\n- = 32 × 9 × 5 × 7\n- = 32 × 9 × 35\n\nLet me calculate:\n- 32 × 9 = 288\n- 288 × 35 = 288 × 30 + 288 × 5\n- = 8640 + 1440\n- = 10080\n\nThe number is 10080.\n\nThe tens digit is **8** (the digits are 1-0-0-8-0, so the tens place is 8).\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: In a 3×3×3 cube, positions expose different numbers of faces: corners (8 cubes, 3 faces each), edges (12 cubes, 2 faces each), face centers (6 cubes, 1 face each), and center (1 cube, 0 faces). To minimize red surface area with 10 red cubes, place them optimally: 1 at center (0 faces), 6 at face centers (6 faces total), and 3 at edges (6 faces total), giving 12 total red faces. Number of red cubes at corners n=0, so d=n+20=20. For Problem 2: Find LCM(20,16,2016). Prime factorizations: 20=2²×5, 16=2⁴, 2016=2⁵×3²×7. LCM=2⁵×3²×5×7=32×9×5×7=10080. The tens digit of 10080 is 8.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"20\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"8\"\n        }",
