      "A3193": "In her last basketball game, Jackie scored 36 points. These points raised the average number of points that she scored per game from 20 to 21. To raise this average to 22 points, how many points must Jackie score in her next game? Instead of determining the score required in the subsequent game to achieve the next targeted average, simply find $e = (total_after - 333)$, where $total_after$ is the cumulative points scored upon attaining the intermediate average following the recent game."

  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nLet me denote:\n- $n$ = number of games before the last game\n- Before the last game: average = 20 points per game\n- Total points before last game = $20n$\n- Last game: Jackie scored 36 points\n- After the last game: average = 21 points per game, total games = $n+1$\n\nSetting up the equation:\n$$\\frac{20n + 36}{n+1} = 21$$\n\nSolving for $n$:\n$$20n + 36 = 21(n+1)$$\n$$20n + 36 = 21n + 21$$\n$$36 - 21 = 21n - 20n$$\n$$15 = n$$\n\nSo Jackie played 15 games before the last game, meaning she has now played 16 games total.\n\nTotal points after the last game (the intermediate average):\n$$total\\_after = 21 \\times 16 = 336$$\n\nNow I need to find $e = (total\\_after - 333)$:\n$$e = 336 - 333 = 3$$\n\n## Problem 2\n\nLet me denote:\n- $x$ = number of 2-point baskets\n- $y$ = number of 3-point baskets\n\nSetting up the system of equations:\n1. Total baskets: $x + y = 10$\n2. Total points: $2x + 3y = 26$\n\nFrom equation 1: $x = 10 - y$\n\nSubstituting into equation 2:\n$$2(10 - y) + 3y = 26$$\n$$20 - 2y + 3y = 26$$\n$$20 + y = 26$$\n$$y = 6$$\n\nVerification:\n- 3-point baskets: 6\n- 2-point baskets: $10 - 6 = 4$\n- Total points: $6(3) + 4(2) = 18 + 8 = 26$ ✓\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: I found that Jackie played 15 games before her last game. After scoring 36 points in her last game, her average became 21 points over 16 games, giving a total of 336 points. Therefore, e = 336 - 333 = 3. For Problem 2: I set up equations where x + y = 10 (total baskets) and 2x + 3y = 26 (total points). Solving these equations, I found y = 6 three-point baskets and x = 4 two-point baskets.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n        }",
