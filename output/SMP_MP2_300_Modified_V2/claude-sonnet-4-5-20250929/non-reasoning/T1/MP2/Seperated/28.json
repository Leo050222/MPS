Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance $s$ equal to that solution plus 48.\n\n**Step 1:** Solve the linear equation $10d + 8 = 528$\n\n$10d + 8 = 528$\n\n$10d = 528 - 8$\n\n$10d = 520$\n\n$d = 52$\n\n**Step 2:** The problem asks for $2d$, which would be $2(52) = 104$\n\n**Step 3:** However, the problem then says \"Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance $s$ equal to that solution plus 48.\"\n\nThis means: $s = d + 48 = 52 + 48 = 100$\n\nSo the answer is $s = 100$.\n\n## Problem 2: Megan and Hana raced their remote control cars for 100 m. The two cars started at the same time. The average speed of Megan's car was $\\frac{5}{4} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Hana's car finished 5 seconds before Megan's car. What was the average speed of Hana's car?\n\n**Step 1:** Find the time it took Megan's car to finish the race.\n\nDistance = 100 m\nSpeed of Megan's car = $\\frac{5}{4}$ m/s\n\nTime = Distance ÷ Speed\n\n$t_{Megan} = \\frac{100}{\\frac{5}{4}} = 100 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{400}{5} = 80$ seconds\n\n**Step 2:** Find the time it took Hana's car to finish the race.\n\nHana's car finished 5 seconds before Megan's car:\n\n$t_{Hana} = t_{Megan} - 5 = 80 - 5 = 75$ seconds\n\n**Step 3:** Find the average speed of Hana's car.\n\nDistance = 100 m\nTime = 75 seconds\n\nSpeed = Distance ÷ Time\n\n$v_{Hana} = \\frac{100}{75} = \\frac{4}{3}$ m/s\n\nTo verify: $\\frac{4}{3} = 1.\\overline{3}$ m/s or $\\frac{4}{3}$ m/s\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Solved 10d + 8 = 528 to get d = 52. Then found s = d + 48 = 52 + 48 = 100. For Problem 2: Megan's time = 100 ÷ (5/4) = 80 seconds. Hana's time = 80 - 5 = 75 seconds.
