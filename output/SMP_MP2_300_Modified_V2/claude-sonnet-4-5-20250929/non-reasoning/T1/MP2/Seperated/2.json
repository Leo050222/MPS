Your store sells only these two models. You plan to issue 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupons, limited to one per order, where x is an integer greater than 0 and smaller than 99. (For example, the discount for an order of 250 RMB is x RMB, not 2x RMB). The Tmall.com '60 RMB off 299 RMB' coupon can be applied to purchases at store B and can be stacked with your 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupon. What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less on either the 250 RMB pair of the headphones or the 600 RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A? What is the minimal number x such that Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less for buying both the 250 RMB pair of the headphones and the 600 RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?"

No, so no discount. Price = 250 RMB\n- Store B: $250 \\geq 99$? Yes, so discount = x. Also $250 \\geq 299$? No, so no Tmall discount.\n  Price = $250 - x$ RMB\n\nFor savings of at least 1 RMB: $250 - (250 - x) \\geq 1$, so $x \\geq 1$.\n\nFor speakers (600 RMB):\n- Store A: $600 \\geq 299$? Yes, so discount = 60. Price = 540 RMB\n- Store B: $600 \\geq 99$? Yes, so discount = x. Also $600 \\geq 299$? Yes, so discount = 60.\n  Price = $600 - x - 60 = 540 - x$ RMB\n\nFor savings of at least 1 RMB: $540 - (540 - x) \\geq 1$, so $x \\geq 1$.\n\nMinimal x for either item: $x = 1$\n\n**Part 2: Minimal x for at least 1 RMB less on both items combined**\n\nTotal in Store A: $250 + 540 = 890$ RMB\n\nFor Store B, buying both items:\n- If purchased separately (two orders):\n  - Headphones: $250 - x$ (one coupon of each type)\n  - Speakers: $600 - x - 60 = 540 - x$ (one coupon of each type)\n  - Total: $790 - 2x$\n\n- If purchased together (one order, total = 850 RMB):\n  - $850 \\geq 99$? Yes, so one x discount\n  - $850 \\geq 299$? Yes, so one 60 discount\n  - Total: $850 - x - 60 = 790 - x$\n\nThe better option is separate orders: $790 - 2x$\n\nFor savings of at least 1 RMB: $890 - (790 - 2x) \\geq 1$\n$100 + 2x \\geq 1$\n$2x \\geq -99$\n$x \\geq -49.5$\n\nSince $x > 0$, any positive x works.
