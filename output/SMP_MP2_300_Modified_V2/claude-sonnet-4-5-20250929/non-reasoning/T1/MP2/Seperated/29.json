The number 1.011 has the smallest distance (0.011) from 1. Converting to a fraction with denominator 1000: 1.011 = 1011/1000. Then k = 1011/1000 + 748889/1000 = 749900/1000 = 749.9. For Problem 2: The ratio of milk to flour is 50:250 = 1:5. For 750 mL of flour, the milk needed is (1/5) × 750 = 150 mL.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"749.9\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"150\"\n        }",
