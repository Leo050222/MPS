If Ari and Bri begin at the same time, how many minutes after Ari finishes the trip will Bri finish? Instead of determining the time lag in minutes between the two riders' completion times, simply find $f = t_B - \\frac{5}{4}$, where $t_B$ is the time in hours required for the rider with the slower speed to complete the trip."

Following the instruction, I calculate $f = t_B - \\frac{5}{4}$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\n**Given:**\n- 50% of N is 16\n\n**Step 1:** Find N.\n\n$0.50 \\times N = 16$\n\n$N = \\frac{16}{0.50} = 32$\n\n**Step 2:** Find 75% of N.\n\n$0.75 \\times N = 0.75 \\times 32 = 24$\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Calculated Bri's time as t_B = 30/15 = 2 hours, then computed f = t_B - 5/4 = 2 - 1.25 = 0.75. For Problem 2: From 50% of N = 16, found N = 32, then calculated 75% of 32 = 24.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"0.75\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"24\"\n        }",
