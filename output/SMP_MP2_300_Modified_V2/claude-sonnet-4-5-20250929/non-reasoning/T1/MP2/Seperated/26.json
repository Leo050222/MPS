Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes."

For Problem 2: Bicycle sale price is $256 (20% off $320), helmet sale price is $72 (10% off $80). Total regular price is $400, total sale price is $328, savings is $72, which is 18% of $400.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"18\"\n        }",
