Testing factorizations with constraint x > y gives x = 23, y = 16. Thus k = y + 14 = 30. For Problem 2: Initially 30 people with 18 men (60%). Need men to be 40% after women enter. Setting up equation 18 = 0.40(30 + w) gives w = 15 women.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"30\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"15\"\n        }",
