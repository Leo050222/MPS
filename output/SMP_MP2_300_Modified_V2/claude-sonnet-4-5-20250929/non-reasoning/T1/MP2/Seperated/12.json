Step 2: If $m$ is even, Alicia sets $n=\frac{1}{2} m$. If $m$ is odd, Alicia sets $n=m+1$. Step 3: Alicia writes down the number $m+n+1$ as the next term. Step 4: Alicia sets $m$ equal to the value of the term that she just wrote down in Step 3. Step 5: Alicia repeats Steps 2, 3, 4 until she has five terms, at which point she stops. Instead of determining the fifth term generated by the iterative algorithm, simply find $k$ equal to the fifth term minus 30."

For Term 2, since 3 is odd, n=4, so next term is 3+4+1=8. For Term 3, since 8 is even, n=4, so next term is 8+4+1=13. For Term 4, since 13 is odd, n=14, so next term is 13+14+1=28. For Term 5, since 28 is even, n=14, so next term is 28+14+1=43. Thus k = 43-30 = 13.
