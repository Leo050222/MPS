      "A3034": "A group of friends are sharing a bag of candy. On the first day, they eat $\frac{1}{2}$ of the candies in the bag. On the second day, they eat $\frac{2}{3}$ of the remaining candies. On the third day, they eat $\frac{3}{4}$ of the remaining candies. On the fourth day, they eat $\frac{4}{5}$ of the remaining candies. On the fifth day, they eat $\frac{5}{6}$ of the remaining candies. At the end of the fifth day, there is 1 candy remaining in the bag. How many candies were in the bag before the first day? Instead of determining the initial number of candies in the bag, simply find $k = r - 269$, where $r$ is the number of candies remaining after the first day derived from the consumption on the first day."

Let me consider the most common pattern where tiles are arranged in a row sharing edges:\n\n- Figure 1: 1 triangle, perimeter = 21 cm (3 sides of length 7)\n- Figure 2: 2 triangles sharing one edge, perimeter = 21 + 7 + 7 = 35 cm (5 sides of length 7)\n- Figure 3: 3 triangles in a row, perimeter = 21 + 7 + 7 = 35 + 7 + 7 = 49 cm (7 sides of length 7)\n\nI notice a pattern: For $n$ tiles arranged in a row sharing edges:\n- Perimeter = $(2n + 1) \\times 7$ cm\n\nLet me verify:\n- $n = 1$: $(2(1) + 1) \\times 7 = 3 \\times 7 = 21$ ✓\n- $n = 2$: $(2(2) + 1) \\times 7 = 5 \\times 7 = 35$ ✓\n- $n = 3$: $(2(3) + 1) \\times 7 = 7 \\times 7 = 49$ ✓\n\nFor perimeter = 91 cm:\n$$(2n + 1) \\times 7 = 91$$\n$$2n + 1 = 13$$\n$$2n = 12$$\n$$n = 6$$\n\nTherefore, 6 tiles are used to form the figure with perimeter 91 cm.\n\nLet me verify: $(2(6) + 1) \\times 7 = 13 \\times 7 = 91$ ✓\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Starting with N candies, after each day the fraction remaining follows a pattern. After day 1: N/2, day 2: N/6, day 3: N/24, day 4: N/120, day 5: N/720 = 1. So N = 720. After day 1, r = 360, thus k = 360 - 269 = 91. For Problem 2: Equilateral triangles with side 7 cm arranged in a row sharing edges. For n tiles, perimeter = (2n+1)×7. Setting this equal to 91: (2n+1)×7 = 91, so 2n+1 = 13, giving n = 6.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"91\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n        }",
