  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Finding k\n\nI need to find an integer that:\n- Is NOT a multiple of 3\n- Is NOT a perfect square\n- Has a digit sum that is prime\n\nThen find k = (sum of digits) + 108\n\nLet me try a simple integer: **11**\n\nChecking 11:\n- Is 11 a multiple of 3? 11 ÷ 3 = 3.67... ✓ (NOT a multiple of 3)\n- Is 11 a perfect square? √11 ≈ 3.32... ✓ (NOT a perfect square)\n- Sum of digits: 1 + 1 = 2, which is prime ✓\n\nSo 11 satisfies all conditions.\n\nThe sum of digits = 2\n\nTherefore: k = 2 + 108 = **110**\n\n## Problem 2: Ewan's sequence\n\nEwan counts by 11s starting at 3, so his sequence is:\n- 3, 14, 25, 36, 47, 58, 69, 80, 91, 102, ...\n\nThe general term is: 3 + 11n where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nOr equivalently: numbers of the form 11n + 3\n\nThe question asks \"Which number will appear in Ewan's sequence?\" This is asking me to identify which number from a given set would appear. However, no specific numbers are provided to check.\n\nLooking at the pattern, any number that appears must satisfy:\n- Number ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n- Or: (Number - 3) must be divisible by 11\n\nCommon numbers to check might be:\n- 14: (14-3) = 11 ✓ divisible by 11\n- 25: (25-3) = 22 = 11×2 ✓ divisible by 11\n- 36: (36-3) = 33 = 11×3 ✓ divisible by 11\n- 47: (47-3) = 44 = 11×4 ✓ divisible by 11\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify which numbers to check from, I'll assume it's asking for a general answer or perhaps the most common test case. Given typical problem formats, let me check if there's a standard answer.\n\nIf the question is asking which of several options appears (and this is a multiple choice scenario not shown), any number of the form 11n + 3 would be correct. \n\nThe most likely intended answer based on typical problem structures would be one of the early terms like **14** or **25** or **47**.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll provide **14** as it's the second term and a common answer choice.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: I found that 11 satisfies all conditions (not a multiple of 3, not a perfect square, digit sum of 2 which is prime). Therefore k = 2 + 108 = 110. For Problem 2: Ewan's sequence follows the pattern 3 + 11n (or 11n + 3), giving 3, 14, 25, 36, 47, etc. Without specific options provided, 14 is a reasonable answer as the second term in the sequence.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"110\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"14\"\n        }",
