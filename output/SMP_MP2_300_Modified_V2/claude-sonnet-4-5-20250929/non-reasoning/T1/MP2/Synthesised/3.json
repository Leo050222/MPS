  "math_problem": "If $x$ and $y$ are positive integers with $x+y=31$, what is the largest possible value of $x y$? Instead of finding the largest possible value of the product $x y$, simply find $k$, which is that largest value minus 231. If a line segment joins the points $(-k,-(k - 7))$ and $((k - 3),(k - 1))$, how many points on the line segment have coordinates that are both integers?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Find the largest possible value of xy when x + y = 31\n\nFor positive integers x and y with x + y = 31, I need to maximize xy.\n\nUsing the AM-GM inequality, or by calculus, the product is maximized when x and y are as close as possible to each other.\n\nSince x + y = 31 (odd sum), the closest we can get is:\n- x = 15, y = 16 (or vice versa)\n\nLet me verify: xy = 15 × 16 = 240\n\nAlternatively, I can check nearby values:\n- x = 14, y = 17: xy = 238\n- x = 15, y = 16: xy = 240\n- x = 13, y = 18: xy = 234\n\nSo the maximum value of xy is 240.\n\n## Step 2: Find k\n\nk = (largest value of xy) - 231 = 240 - 231 = 9\n\n## Step 3: Find the coordinates of the line segment endpoints\n\nWith k = 9:\n- Point 1: (-k, -(k-7)) = (-9, -(9-7)) = (-9, -2)\n- Point 2: (k-3, k-1) = (9-3, 9-1) = (6, 8)\n\n## Step 4: Count integer points on the line segment from (-9, -2) to (6, 8)\n\nFirst, I'll find the direction vector:\n- Δx = 6 - (-9) = 15\n- Δy = 8 - (-2) = 10\n\nThe parametric equations are:\n- x(t) = -9 + 15t\n- y(t) = -2 + 10t\n\nwhere t ∈ [0, 1]\n\nFor both coordinates to be integers, I need:\n- -9 + 15t ∈ ℤ\n- -2 + 10t ∈ ℤ\n\nThis means:\n- 15t ∈ ℤ\n- 10t ∈ ℤ\n\nSo t must be a multiple of 1/gcd(15, 10) = 1/5.\n\nThe values of t are: 0, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1\n\nLet me verify each point:\n- t = 0: (-9, -2) ✓\n- t = 1/5: (-9 + 3, -2 + 2) = (-6, 0) ✓\n- t = 2/5: (-9 + 6, -2 + 4) = (-3, 2) ✓\n- t = 3/5: (-9 + 9, -2 + 6) = (0, 4) ✓\n- t = 4/5: (-9 + 12, -2 + 8) = (3, 6) ✓\n- t = 1: (6, 8) ✓\n\nTherefore, there are **6** points on the line segment with integer coordinates.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found that for x + y = 31 with positive integers, the maximum value of xy is 240 (when x=15, y=16). Then k = 240 - 231 = 9. The line segment connects (-9, -2) and (6, 8). The direction vector is (15, 10), and gcd(15, 10) = 5. The number of integer points on the segment is 1 + gcd(15, 10) = 1 + 5 = 6, corresponding to t = 0, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
