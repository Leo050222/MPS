  "math_problem": "An electric car is charged 3 times per week for 52 weeks. The cost to charge the car each time is $0.78. What is the total cost to charge the car over these 52 weeks? Instead of computing the overall expenditure, simply find $t_c$, the total number of charging sessions over the 52 weeks. If $4x + (t_c - 142) = 8x - 48$, what is the value of $2x$?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Find $t_c$, the total number of charging sessions over 52 weeks**\n\nThe car is charged 3 times per week for 52 weeks.\n\n$t_c = 3 \\times 52 = 156$\n\nSo the total number of charging sessions is 156.\n\n**Step 2: Solve the equation for x**\n\nGiven: $4x + (t_c - 142) = 8x - 48$\n\nSubstituting $t_c = 156$:\n$4x + (156 - 142) = 8x - 48$\n$4x + 14 = 8x - 48$\n\nNow I'll solve for x:\n$4x + 14 = 8x - 48$\n$14 + 48 = 8x - 4x$\n$62 = 4x$\n$x = \\frac{62}{4} = \\frac{31}{2} = 15.5$\n\n**Step 3: Find the value of 2x**\n\n$2x = 2 \\times 15.5 = 31$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I calculated the total number of charging sessions: t_c = 3 times per week × 52 weeks = 156. Then I substituted this into the equation 4x + (t_c - 142) = 8x - 48, which became 4x + 14 = 8x - 48. Solving for x: 62 = 4x, so x = 15.5. Therefore, 2x = 31.\",\n    \"answer\": \"31\"\n}",
