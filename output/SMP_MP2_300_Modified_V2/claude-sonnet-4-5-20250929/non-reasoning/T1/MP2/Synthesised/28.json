  "math_problem": "Solve for $2d$ if $10d + 8 = 528$. Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance $s$ equal to that solution plus 48. Megan and Hana raced their remote control cars for $s$ m. The two cars started at the same time. The average speed of Megan's car was $\\frac{5}{4} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Hana's car finished $(s - 95)$ seconds before Megan's car. What was the average speed of Hana's car?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Solve for d in the equation 10d + 8 = 528**\n\n10d + 8 = 528\n10d = 528 - 8\n10d = 520\nd = 52\n\nSo 2d = 104\n\n**Step 2: Find the race distance s**\n\nAccording to the problem, s = (solution to 2d) + 48\nWait, let me re-read this. It says \"Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance s equal to that solution plus 48.\"\n\nThe solution to the linear equation is d = 52.\nSo s = 52 + 48 = 100 m\n\n**Step 3: Set up the racing problem**\n\n- Race distance: s = 100 m\n- Megan's car speed: 5/4 m/s = 1.25 m/s\n- Hana's car finished (s - 95) = 100 - 95 = 5 seconds before Megan's car\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Megan's time**\n\nTime for Megan = Distance / Speed = 100 / (5/4) = 100 × (4/5) = 80 seconds\n\n**Step 5: Calculate Hana's time**\n\nHana finished 5 seconds before Megan, so:\nHana's time = 80 - 5 = 75 seconds\n\n**Step 6: Calculate Hana's speed**\n\nHana's speed = Distance / Time = 100 / 75 = 4/3 m/s\n\nLet me verify: \n- Megan's time: 100 ÷ 1.25 = 80 seconds ✓\n- Hana's time: 75 seconds (5 seconds faster) ✓\n- Hana's speed: 100 ÷ 75 = 4/3 m/s ✓\n\nConverting to decimal: 4/3 = 1.333... m/s\n\nThe answer can be expressed as 4/3 m/s or as a decimal.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I solved 10d + 8 = 528 to get d = 52. Then s = 52 + 48 = 100 m. Megan's car traveled 100 m at 5/4 m/s, taking 80 seconds. Hana's car finished (100-95) = 5 seconds earlier, so in 75 seconds. Hana's speed = 100/75 = 4/3 m/s.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4/3\"\n}",
