  "math_problem": "What is the area of the region \\( \\mathcal{R} \\) formed by all points \\( L(r, t) \\) with \\( 0 \\leq r \\leq 10 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq t \\leq 10 \\) such that the area of triangle \\( JKL \\) is less than or equal to 10, where \\( J(2,7) \\) and \\( K(5,3) \\)? Instead of finding the area of the region formed by points satisfying the triangle area condition, simply find $height1$, where $height1$ is the y-coordinate of the intersection of the lower bounding line with the y-axis derived from the geometric constraints defining the region. Dolly, Molly, and Polly each can walk at $(height1 + 3) \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{h}$. Their one motorcycle, which travels at $(height1 + 87) \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{h}$, can accommodate at most two of them at once. What is true about the smallest possible time $t$ for all three of them to reach a point (height1 + 132) km away?",
