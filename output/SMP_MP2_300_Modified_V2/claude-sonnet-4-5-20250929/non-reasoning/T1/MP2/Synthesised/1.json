  "math_problem": "Pablo has 27 solid $1 \\\\times 1 \\\\times 1$ cubes that he assembles in a larger $3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 3$ cube. If 10 of the smaller cubes are red, 9 are blue, and 8 are yellow, what is the smallest possible surface area of the larger cube that is red? Instead of determining the minimal total exposed face area contributed by the red small cubes on the surface of the assembled large cube, simply find $d = n + 20$, where $n$ is the number of red small cubes placed in positions exposing three faces in the assembly that achieves this minimum. What is the tens digit of the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of $d$, $(d - 4)$, and $(d + 1996)$?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n- We have a 3×3×3 cube made of 27 unit cubes\n- 10 red, 9 blue, 8 yellow cubes\n- We need to find the minimum red surface area\n- Then calculate d = n + 20, where n is the number of red cubes at corners (exposing 3 faces)\n- Finally, find the tens digit of the smallest positive integer divisible by d, (d-4), and (d+1996)\n\n**Step 1: Analyze cube positions in a 3×3×3 cube**\n\nIn a 3×3×3 cube:\n- 8 corner positions (each exposes 3 faces)\n- 12 edge positions (each exposes 2 faces)\n- 6 face center positions (each exposes 1 face)\n- 1 center position (exposes 0 faces)\n\n**Step 2: Minimize red surface area**\n\nTo minimize red surface area, we should:\n1. Place red cubes in positions with fewer exposed faces\n2. Prioritize: center (0 faces) → face centers (1 face) → edges (2 faces) → corners (3 faces)\n\nWith 10 red cubes:\n- 1 in center (0 faces exposed)\n- 6 in face centers (6 faces exposed)\n- 3 in edge positions (6 faces exposed)\n- Total minimum red surface area = 0 + 6 + 6 = 12 square units\n\nSo n = 0 (no red cubes at corners in the minimum configuration)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate d**\n\nd = n + 20 = 0 + 20 = 20\n\n**Step 4: Find LCM of d, (d-4), and (d+1996)**\n\nWe need LCM(20, 16, 2016)\n\nFactor each:\n- 20 = 2² × 5\n- 16 = 2⁴\n- 2016 = 2⁵ × 3² × 7\n\nLCM = 2⁵ × 3² × 5 × 7 = 32 × 9 × 5 × 7 = 10,080\n\n**Step 5: Find the tens digit**\n\n10,080 has digits: 1, 0, 0, 8, 0\n\nThe tens digit (second from right) is 8.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the problem statement. It says \"the number of red small cubes placed in positions exposing three faces in the assembly that achieves this minimum.\"\n\nActually, to achieve minimum red surface area with 10 red cubes:\n- We want to minimize total exposed red faces\n- Best strategy: 1 center + 6 face centers + 3 edges = 10 cubes\n- This gives 0 + 6(1) + 3(2) = 12 exposed red faces\n- In this configuration, n = 0 (no red cubes at corners)\n\nSo d = 0 + 20 = 20\n\nLCM(20, 16, 2016):\n- 20 = 4 × 5 = 2² × 5\n- 16 = 2⁴\n- 2016 = 2016 ÷ 2 = 1008 ÷ 2 = 504 ÷ 2 = 252 ÷ 2 = 126 ÷ 2 = 63\n- 2016 = 2⁵ × 63 = 2⁵ × 9 × 7 = 2⁵ × 3² × 7\n\nLCM = 2⁵ × 3² × 5 × 7 = 32 × 9 × 5 × 7 = 10,080\n\nThe number 10,080 written out: 10080\n- Units digit: 0\n- Tens digit: 8\n- Hundreds digit: 0\n- Thousands digit: 0\n- Ten-thousands digit: 1\n\nThe tens digit is **8**.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"In a 3×3×3 cube, positions expose different numbers of faces: corners (3), edges (2), face centers (1), and center (0). To minimize red surface area with 10 red cubes, place them optimally: 1 center + 6 face centers + 3 edges = 12 exposed red faces. This means n=0 red cubes at corners. Thus d = n + 20 = 20. We need LCM(20, 16, 2016) = LCM(2²×5, 2⁴, 2⁵×3²×7) = 2⁵×3²×5×7 = 10,080. The tens digit of 10,080 is 8.\",\n    \"answer\": \"8\"\n}",
