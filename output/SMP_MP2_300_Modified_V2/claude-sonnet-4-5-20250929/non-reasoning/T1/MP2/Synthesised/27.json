  "math_problem": "In her last basketball game, Jackie scored 36 points. These points raised the average number of points that she scored per game from 20 to 21. To raise this average to 22 points, how many points must Jackie score in her next game? Instead of determining the score required in the subsequent game to achieve the next targeted average, simply find total_after, where total_after is the cumulative points scored upon attaining the intermediate average following the recent game. Lauren plays basketball with her friends. She makes 10 baskets. Each of these baskets is worth either 2 or (total_after - 333) points. Lauren scores a total of 26 points. How many (total_after - 333) point baskets did she make?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Finding total_after**\n\nLet me denote:\n- n = number of games Jackie played before her last game\n- The average before the last game was 20 points\n- After scoring 36 points in her last game, the average became 21 points\n\nFrom the average before the last game:\nTotal points before last game = 20n\n\nAfter the last game:\nTotal points = 20n + 36\nNumber of games = n + 1\nNew average = 21\n\nSo: (20n + 36)/(n + 1) = 21\n\nSolving for n:\n20n + 36 = 21(n + 1)\n20n + 36 = 21n + 21\n36 - 21 = 21n - 20n\n15 = n\n\nSo Jackie had played 15 games before her last game.\n\nNow I can find total_after:\n- Total points before last game = 20 × 15 = 300\n- Total points after last game (total_after) = 300 + 36 = 336\n\nTherefore, **total_after = 336**\n\n**Part 2: Lauren's basketball problem**\n\nNow I need to find how many (total_after - 333) point baskets Lauren made.\n\nGiven:\n- total_after = 336\n- So (total_after - 333) = 336 - 333 = 3\n- Lauren makes 10 baskets total\n- Each basket is worth either 2 or 3 points\n- Total score = 26 points\n\nLet:\n- x = number of 2-point baskets\n- y = number of 3-point baskets\n\nWe have:\n1. x + y = 10 (total baskets)\n2. 2x + 3y = 26 (total points)\n\nFrom equation 1: x = 10 - y\n\nSubstituting into equation 2:\n2(10 - y) + 3y = 26\n20 - 2y + 3y = 26\n20 + y = 26\ny = 6\n\nTherefore, Lauren made **6** three-point baskets (which are the (total_after - 333) point baskets).\n\nLet me verify:\n- 6 three-point baskets = 18 points\n- 4 two-point baskets = 8 points\n- Total = 26 points ✓\n- Total baskets = 10 ✓\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found that Jackie played 15 games before her last game. With an average of 20 points, she had 300 total points. After scoring 36 in her last game, total_after = 336. Then, for Lauren's problem, (total_after - 333) = 3, so each special basket is worth 3 points. With 10 total baskets worth 26 points, if x is 2-point baskets and y is 3-point baskets: x + y = 10 and 2x + 3y = 26. Solving gives y = 6.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
