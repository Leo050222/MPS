  "math_problem": "A cube has an edge length of 30. A rectangular solid has edge lengths 20, 30, and $L$. If the cube and the rectangular solid have equal surface areas, what is the value of $L$? Instead of determining the third edge length of the rectangular solid, simply find $h = S - 5397$, where $S$ is the surface area of the cube. The line with equation $y = x$ is translated $h$ units to the right and $(h - 1)$ units down. What is the $y$-intercept of the resulting line?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Find the surface area of the cube**\n\nA cube with edge length 30 has surface area:\n$$S = 6 \\times 30^2 = 6 \\times 900 = 5400$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate h**\n\nGiven that $h = S - 5397$:\n$$h = 5400 - 5397 = 3$$\n\n**Step 3: Understand the line translation**\n\nThe original line is $y = x$.\n\nThe line is translated:\n- $h = 3$ units to the right\n- $(h - 1) = 3 - 1 = 2$ units down\n\n**Step 4: Apply the translation**\n\nWhen a line is translated $a$ units to the right and $b$ units down, a point $(x, y)$ on the original line becomes $(x + a, y - b)$ on the new line.\n\nFor the line $y = x$:\n- Original point: $(x, y)$ where $y = x$\n- New point: $(x + 3, y - 2)$\n\nTo find the equation of the new line, let's use $(x', y')$ for points on the new line:\n- $x' = x + 3$, so $x = x' - 3$\n- $y' = y - 2$, so $y = y' + 2$\n\nSince $y = x$ on the original line:\n$$y' + 2 = x' - 3$$\n$$y' = x' - 5$$\n\nSo the new line has equation $y = x - 5$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the y-intercept**\n\nThe $y$-intercept occurs when $x = 0$:\n$$y = 0 - 5 = -5$$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I calculated the surface area of the cube: S = 6 × 30² = 5400. Then h = S - 5397 = 5400 - 5397 = 3. The line y = x is translated 3 units right and 2 units down. Using the translation formula, if (x', y') is on the new line and (x, y) is on the original line where y = x, then x' = x + 3 and y' = y - 2. Substituting: y' + 2 = x' - 3, which gives y' = x' - 5. The y-intercept is found by setting x = 0: y = -5.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-5\"\n}",
