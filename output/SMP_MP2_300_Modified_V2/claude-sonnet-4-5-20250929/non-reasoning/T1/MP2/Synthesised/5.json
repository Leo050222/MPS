  "math_problem": "Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. Friday, at which point it had been on for exactly 100 hours. At what time had Kamile turned her computer on? Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day. Three different numbers from the list $2, 3, 4, 6$ have a sum of $k$. What is the product of these numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Find the remainder when 100 hours is divided by 24 hours (hours in a day)**\n\nTo find when the computer was turned on, I need to work backwards 100 hours from 5 p.m. Friday.\n\nFirst, let me find the remainder when 100 is divided by 24:\n- 100 ÷ 24 = 4 remainder 4\n- This means 100 = 24 × 4 + 4\n\nSo h = 4 (the remainder)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate k**\n\nAccording to the problem:\nk = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11\n\n**Step 3: Find three different numbers from {2, 3, 4, 6} that sum to k = 11**\n\nI need to find three different numbers from the list {2, 3, 4, 6} that sum to 11.\n\nLet me check all possible combinations of three numbers:\n- 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 ✗\n- 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 ✓\n- 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 ✗\n- 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 ✗\n\nThe only combination that works is: 2, 3, and 6\n\n**Step 4: Find the product of these three numbers**\n\nProduct = 2 × 3 × 6 = 36\n\n**Verification:**\n- The computer was on for 100 hours\n- 100 = 24 × 4 + 4, so h = 4\n- k = 4 + 7 = 11\n- Three numbers from {2, 3, 4, 6} that sum to 11: {2, 3, 6}\n- Product: 2 × 3 × 6 = 36\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found the remainder when 100 hours is divided by 24 hours: 100 = 24 × 4 + 4, so h = 4. Then k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11. Next, I found three different numbers from {2, 3, 4, 6} that sum to 11: checking all combinations, only 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 works. Finally, the product is 2 × 3 × 6 = 36.\",\n    \"answer\": \"36\"\n}",
