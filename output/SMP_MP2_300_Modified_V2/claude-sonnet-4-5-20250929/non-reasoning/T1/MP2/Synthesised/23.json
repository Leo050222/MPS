  "math_problem": "The average age of Andras, Frances, and Gerta is 22 years. Given that Andras is 23 and Frances is 24, what is Gerta's age? Instead of determining the age of the third individual, simply find $k = g + 62$, where $g$ is the age of the third individual derived from the given average and ages of the other two. Calculate the value of $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{k} + \\sqrt{k}}{2}}$.",
