  "math_problem": "Storage space on a computer is measured in gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB), where $1 \\mathrm{~GB} = 1024 \\mathrm{MB}$. Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes. The regular price for a bicycle is $\\\\$(d + 220)$. The bicycle is on sale for $(d - 80)\\\\%$ off. The regular price for a helmet is $\\\\$(d - 20)$. The helmet is on sale for $(d - 90)\\\\%$ off. If Sandra bought both items on sale, what is her percentage savings on the total purchase?",

Then calculated d = 307,200 - 307,100 = 100. The bicycle's regular price is $320 with 20% off, giving a sale price of $256. The helmet's regular price is $80 with 10% off, giving a sale price of $72. The total regular price is $400 and total sale price is $328, resulting in $72 savings. The percentage savings is 72/400 = 18%.\",\n    \"answer\": \"18\"\n}",
