  "math_problem": "Consider the following flowchart: INPUT $\\rightarrow$ Subtract $8 \\rightarrow \\square \\rightarrow$ Divide by $2 \\rightarrow \\square$ Add $16 \\rightarrow$ OUTPUT. If the OUTPUT is 32, what was the INPUT? Instead of determining the initial input value that produces the specified output via the flowchart's sequence of operations, simply find $k = A - 26$, where $A$ is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step. What is the $y$-intercept of the line $y = x + (k - 2)$ after it is translated down $k$ units?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the flowchart**\nThe flowchart shows:\nINPUT → Subtract 8 → □ → Divide by 2 → □ → Add 16 → OUTPUT\n\nWhere OUTPUT = 32\n\n**Step 2: Work backwards to find the intermediate values**\n\nStarting from OUTPUT = 32:\n- Before \"Add 16\": 32 - 16 = 16\n- Before \"Divide by 2\": 16 × 2 = 32\n- Before \"Subtract 8\" (this is the INPUT): 32 + 8 = 40\n\nSo the flowchart values are:\n- INPUT = 40\n- After \"Subtract 8\": 40 - 8 = 32 (this is at the first □)\n- After \"Divide by 2\": 32 ÷ 2 = 16 (this is at the second □)\n- After \"Add 16\": 16 + 16 = 32 (OUTPUT)\n\n**Step 3: Find A and k**\n\nA is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step.\nA = 32\n\nTherefore:\nk = A - 26 = 32 - 26 = 6\n\n**Step 4: Find the y-intercept of the translated line**\n\nOriginal line: y = x + (k - 2) = x + (6 - 2) = x + 4\n\nThe y-intercept of this line is 4 (when x = 0, y = 4).\n\n**Step 5: Translate the line down k units**\n\nTranslating down k = 6 units means subtracting 6 from the y-value:\nNew line: y = x + 4 - 6 = x - 2\n\nThe y-intercept of the translated line is -2 (when x = 0, y = -2).\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Working backwards from OUTPUT=32: before Add 16 is 16, before Divide by 2 is 32, before Subtract 8 (INPUT) is 40. The first square after subtraction has A=32. Thus k=A-26=32-26=6. The original line y=x+(k-2)=x+4 has y-intercept 4. After translating down k=6 units, the new line is y=x+4-6=x-2, which has y-intercept -2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-2\"\n}",
