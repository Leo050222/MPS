  "math_problem": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$. Shuxin begins with $d$ red candies, $(d - 3)$ yellow candies, and $(d - 7)$ blue candies. After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining. What is the smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Finding the scaling factor k and d**\n\nGiven:\n- Ratio of skateboards to bicycles is 7:4\n- There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles\n- Number of skateboards = 7k\n- Number of bicycles = 4k\n\nFrom the condition \"12 more skateboards than bicycles\":\n7k - 4k = 12\n3k = 12\nk = 4\n\nTherefore:\nd = k + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n**Part 2: Finding the minimum number of candies Shuxin ate**\n\nInitial candies:\n- Red: d = 10\n- Yellow: d - 3 = 7\n- Blue: d - 7 = 3\n\nAfter eating some candies, equal numbers of each color remain. Let's say r candies of each color remain.\n\nConstraints:\n- r ≤ 3 (since we can't have more blue candies remaining than we started with)\n- r ≤ 7 (yellow constraint)\n- r ≤ 10 (red constraint)\n\nSo r ≤ 3.\n\nCandies eaten:\n- Red eaten: 10 - r\n- Yellow eaten: 7 - r\n- Blue eaten: 3 - r\n\nTotal eaten: (10 - r) + (7 - r) + (3 - r) = 20 - 3r\n\nTo minimize the number of candies eaten, we need to maximize r.\n\nThe maximum value of r is 3 (limited by the blue candies).\n\nWhen r = 3:\n- Red eaten: 10 - 3 = 7\n- Yellow eaten: 7 - 3 = 4\n- Blue eaten: 3 - 3 = 0\n\nTotal eaten: 7 + 4 + 0 = 11\n\nLet me verify: After eating, we have 3 red, 3 yellow, and 3 blue candies remaining. ✓\n\nThe smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate is 11.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found k = 4 from the skateboard/bicycle problem, giving d = 10. Then with initial candies of 10 red, 7 yellow, and 3 blue, to have equal numbers remaining, the maximum equal amount is 3 (limited by blue). This means eating 7 red, 4 yellow, and 0 blue candies, totaling 11 candies eaten.\",\n    \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
