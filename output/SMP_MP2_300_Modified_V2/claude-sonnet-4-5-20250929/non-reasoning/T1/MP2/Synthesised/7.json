  "math_problem": "The product of $N$ consecutive four-digit positive integers is divisible by $2010^{2}$. What is the least possible value of $N$? Instead of determining the smallest such $N$, simply find $e = v_5(\\ell) - 2$, where $\\ell$ is the largest four-digit multiple of $25$ that is less than $2 \\times 67^2$. The area of the triangular region bounded by the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis and the line with equation $y=2x-(e + 6)$ is one-quarter of the area of the triangular region bounded by the $x$-axis, the line with equation $y=2x-(e + 6)$ and the line with equation $x=d$, where $d>e$. What is the value of $d$?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Find $\\ell$, the largest four-digit multiple of 25 that is less than $2 \\times 67^2$**\n\nFirst, calculate $2 \\times 67^2$:\n- $67^2 = 4489$\n- $2 \\times 67^2 = 2 \\times 4489 = 8978$\n\nNow find the largest four-digit multiple of 25 less than 8978:\n- $8978 \\div 25 = 359.12$\n- So we need $25 \\times 359 = 8975$\n\nTherefore, $\\ell = 8975$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate $e = v_5(\\ell) - 2$**\n\n$v_5(\\ell)$ is the 5-adic valuation of $\\ell$, which counts how many times 5 divides $\\ell$.\n\n$\\ell = 8975 = 25 \\times 359 = 5^2 \\times 359$\n\nCheck if 359 is divisible by 5:\n- $359 = 5 \\times 71 + 4$, so 359 is not divisible by 5.\n\nTherefore, $v_5(8975) = 2$.\n\nThus, $e = v_5(\\ell) - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Set up the triangular regions**\n\nThe line equation is $y = 2x - (e + 6) = 2x - 6$.\n\n**Triangle 1** (bounded by $x$-axis, $y$-axis, and the line):\n- The line intersects the $x$-axis when $y = 0$: $0 = 2x - 6 \\Rightarrow x = 3$\n- The line intersects the $y$-axis when $x = 0$: $y = -6$\n- Vertices: $(0, 0)$, $(3, 0)$, $(0, -6)$\n- Area = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 6 = 9$\n\n**Triangle 2** (bounded by $x$-axis, line $y = 2x - 6$, and line $x = d$):\n- Vertices: $(3, 0)$ (where line meets $x$-axis), $(d, 0)$, $(d, 2d - 6)$ (where $x = d$ meets the line)\n- Area = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times |d - 3| \\times |2d - 6|$\n\nSince $d > e = 0$ and we need $d > 3$ for the triangle to make sense (otherwise the area would be zero or negative), we have:\n- Area = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (d - 3) \\times (2d - 6) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (d - 3) \\times 2(d - 3) = (d - 3)^2$\n\n**Step 4: Apply the condition**\n\nArea of Triangle 1 = $\\frac{1}{4}$ × Area of Triangle 2\n\n$9 = \\frac{1}{4} \\times (d - 3)^2$\n\n$(d - 3)^2 = 36$\n\n$d - 3 = \\pm 6$\n\nSince $d > 3$ (we need $d > e = 0$ and the geometry requires $d > 3$):\n$d - 3 = 6$\n\n$d = 9$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I calculated 2 × 67² = 8978. The largest four-digit multiple of 25 less than 8978 is 8975 = 25 × 359 = 5² × 359. Since 359 is not divisible by 5, v₅(8975) = 2, so e = 2 - 2 = 0. The line equation becomes y = 2x - 6. Triangle 1 (bounded by axes and the line) has vertices (0,0), (3,0), (0,-6) with area 9. Triangle 2 (bounded by x-axis, the line, and x = d) has area (d-3)². Setting 9 = ¼(d-3)² gives (d-3)² = 36, so d - 3 = 6 (taking positive root since d > 3), thus d = 9.\",\n    \"answer\": \"9\"\n}",
