  "math_problem": "Alicia starts a sequence with $m=3$. What is the fifth term of her sequence following the algorithm: Step 1: Alicia writes down the number $m$ as the first term. Step 2: If $m$ is even, Alicia sets $n=\\frac{1}{2} m$. If $m$ is odd, Alicia sets $n=m+1$. Step 3: Alicia writes down the number $m+n+1$ as the next term. Step 4: Alicia sets $m$ equal to the value of the term that she just wrote down in Step 3. Step 5: Alicia repeats Steps 2, 3, 4 until she has five terms, at which point she stops. Instead of determining the fifth term generated by the iterative algorithm, simply find $k$ equal to the fifth term minus 30. Evaluate the expression $\\sqrt{k+\\sqrt{7+\\sqrt{4}}}$.",
