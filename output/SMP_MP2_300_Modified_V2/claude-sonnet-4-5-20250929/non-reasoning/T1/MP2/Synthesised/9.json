  "math_problem": "A store sells jellybeans at a fixed price per gram. The price for 250 g of jellybeans is $7.50$. What mass of jellybeans sells for $1.80$? Instead of determining the mass corresponding to a specified price, simply find $p$, the fixed price per gram. We call the pair $(m, n)$ of positive integers a happy pair if the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is a perfect square. For example, $(20, 24)$ is a happy pair because the greatest common divisor of 20 and 24 is 4. Suppose that $k$ is a positive integer such that $((p + \\frac{20579997}{100}), 35k)$ is a happy pair. What is the number of possible values of $k$ with $k \\leq (p + \\frac{293997}{100})$?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Find the fixed price per gram (p)**\n\nGiven that 250 g of jellybeans costs $7.50:\n- Price per gram: p = 7.50 / 250 = 0.03 dollars per gram\n\nSo p = 0.03 = 3/100\n\n**Step 2: Understand the happy pair condition**\n\nA pair (m, n) is a happy pair if gcd(m, n) is a perfect square.\n\nWe need to find the number of possible values of k where:\n- The pair is ((p + 20579997/100), 35k)\n- k ≤ (p + 293997/100)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the first element of the pair**\n\np + 20579997/100 = 3/100 + 20579997/100 = 20580000/100 = 205800\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the upper bound for k**\n\nk ≤ p + 293997/100 = 3/100 + 293997/100 = 294000/100 = 2940\n\n**Step 5: Analyze when (205800, 35k) is a happy pair**\n\nFirst, let's factor 205800:\n205800 = 2058 × 100 = 2058 × 4 × 25 = 2058 × 2² × 5²\n\nLet me factor 2058:\n2058 = 2 × 1029 = 2 × 3 × 343 = 2 × 3 × 7³\n\nSo: 205800 = 2³ × 3 × 5² × 7³\n\nAnd 35k = 5 × 7 × k\n\n**Step 6: Find gcd(205800, 35k)**\n\ngcd(205800, 35k) = gcd(2³ × 3 × 5² × 7³, 5 × 7 × k)\n\nThe gcd will include:\n- Factor 5: min(2, 1) = 1, so 5¹\n- Factor 7: min(3, 1) = 1, so 7¹\n- Plus any common factors from k\n\nLet k = 2^a × 3^b × 5^c × 7^d × (other primes)\n\nThen gcd(205800, 35k) = 2^min(3,a) × 3^min(1,b) × 5^min(2,c+1) × 7^min(3,d+1) × ...\n\nFor this to be a perfect square, all exponents must be even.\n\n**Step 7: Determine conditions on k**\n\nFrom 35k = 5 × 7 × k, we have:\ngcd(205800, 35k) = 5 × 7 × gcd(2³ × 3 × 5 × 7², k)\n\nLet gcd(2³ × 3 × 5 × 7², k) = 2^a × 3^b × 5^c × 7^d × ... where:\n- 0 ≤ a ≤ 3\n- 0 ≤ b ≤ 1\n- 0 ≤ c ≤ 1\n- 0 ≤ d ≤ 2\n\nThen gcd(205800, 35k) = 2^a × 3^b × 5^(c+1) × 7^(d+1) × ...\n\nFor this to be a perfect square:\n- a must be even: a ∈ {0, 2}\n- b must be even: b ∈ {0}\n- c+1 must be even: c must be odd, so c ∈ {1}\n- d+1 must be even: d must be odd, so d ∈ {1}\n\nTherefore, k must be divisible by 5 × 7 = 35, and when we write k = 35m:\n- m must be odd (so that the factor of 7 in k is exactly 7¹)\n- m must not be divisible by 3\n- m can be divisible by 2^0 or 2^2 (i.e., m ≡ 1 or 4 (mod 8) if considering only powers of 2)\n\nActually, let me reconsider: k must have the form where k = 5 × 7 × m where m is odd and not divisible by 3.\n\n**Step 8: Count valid values**\n\nk = 35m where m is odd, not divisible by 3, and k ≤ 2940\nSo m ≤ 2940/35 = 84\n\nAmong integers 1 to 84:\n- Odd integers: 42\n- Odd integers divisible by 3: 14 (3, 9, 15, ..., 81)\n- Odd integers not divisible by 3: 42 - 14 = 28\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"First, I found p = 0.03. Then calculated that the first element is 205800 and k ≤ 2940. For (205800, 35k) to be a happy pair, gcd must be a perfect square. After factoring 205800 = 2³ × 3 × 5² × 7³ and analyzing the gcd conditions, k must equal 35m where m is odd and not divisible by 3. With k ≤ 2940, we have m ≤ 84. Among 1 to 84, there are 42 odd numbers, of which 14 are divisible by 3, leaving 28 valid values.\",\n  \"answer\": \"28\"\n}",
