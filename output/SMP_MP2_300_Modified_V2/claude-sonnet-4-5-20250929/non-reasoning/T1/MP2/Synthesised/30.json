  "math_problem": "Anna thinks of an integer that is not a multiple of three, not a perfect square, and the sum of its digits is a prime number. What could the integer be? Instead of identifying an integer satisfying the conditions on multiples of three, perfect squares, and prime digit sums, simply find $k$ equal to the sum of the digits of such an integer plus 108. Ewan writes out a sequence where he counts by $(k - 102)$s starting at $(k - 110)$. Which number will appear in Ewan's sequence?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Find an integer satisfying Anna's conditions**\n\nAnna needs an integer that:\n- Is NOT a multiple of 3\n- Is NOT a perfect square\n- Has a digit sum that is prime\n\nLet me try a simple integer: 11\n- Not a multiple of 3? ✓ (11 ÷ 3 = 3.67...)\n- Not a perfect square? ✓ (√11 ≈ 3.32...)\n- Sum of digits = 1 + 1 = 2, which is prime ✓\n\nSo 11 works! The sum of its digits is 2.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate k**\n\nk = sum of digits + 108\nk = 2 + 108 = 110\n\n**Step 3: Determine Ewan's sequence parameters**\n\nEwan counts by (k - 102)s starting at (k - 110).\n\nWith k = 110:\n- Starting value: k - 110 = 110 - 110 = 0\n- Increment: k - 102 = 110 - 102 = 8\n\nSo Ewan's sequence is: 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, ...\n\nThis is the sequence of multiples of 8 starting from 0.\n\n**Step 4: Identify which number appears in the sequence**\n\nThe problem asks \"Which number will appear in Ewan's sequence?\" This seems to be asking for a specific number, likely related to the problem context.\n\nSince the sequence consists of all non-negative multiples of 8 (0, 8, 16, 24, 32, ...), any multiple of 8 will appear in this sequence.\n\nGiven the context and that we found k = 110, let me check if 110 itself appears:\n110 ÷ 8 = 13.75 (not a whole number, so 110 doesn't appear)\n\nLet me reconsider what the question is asking. Perhaps it's asking about a specific value related to k or the original problem. Common candidates might be:\n- k = 110 (doesn't appear)\n- k - 102 = 8 (appears - it's the second term)\n- k - 110 = 0 (appears - it's the first term)\n\nThe most natural answer, given that the sequence starts at 0 and counts by 8s, would be to identify that numbers like 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, ... appear.\n\nSince 112 is close to k = 110 and is in the sequence (112 = 8 × 14), this might be the intended answer. Alternatively, since the problem setup involves k = 110, and we're looking at multiples of 8, perhaps the answer is simply describing that multiples of 8 appear, or a specific multiple like 8, 16, 24, etc.\n\nGiven the phrasing \"Which number will appear,\" I believe the answer is asking for any valid number in the sequence. The most straightforward answers would be 0, 8, or any multiple of 8.\n\nHowever, if this is asking for a specific number related to the problem, 8 (the increment itself) or 0 (the starting point) are the most directly connected to the problem parameters.\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Anna's integer must not be a multiple of 3, not a perfect square, and have a prime digit sum. The integer 11 satisfies all conditions with digit sum 2. Therefore k = 2 + 108 = 110. Ewan's sequence starts at k - 110 = 0 and counts by k - 102 = 8, giving the sequence 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, ... Any multiple of 8 appears in this sequence.\",\n    \"answer\": \"8\"\n}",
