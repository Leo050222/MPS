  "math_problem": "Each of four doors is randomly either open or closed. What is the probability that exactly two of the four doors are open? Instead of determining the probability of exactly two open doors among the four, simply find $Pr$, where $Pr$ is the probability that exactly two of the four doors are open derived from counting the favorable configurations among all possible states of the doors. The line with equation $y=2x-(Pr + 45/8)$ is translated upwards by 4 units. What is the $x$-intercept of the resulting line?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Find the probability Pr that exactly two of the four doors are open**\n\nEach door can be in one of two states: open or closed, with equal probability (1/2 each).\n\nTotal possible configurations: 2^4 = 16\n\nTo find favorable configurations (exactly 2 doors open):\n- We need to choose which 2 doors out of 4 are open\n- This is a combination problem: C(4,2) = 4!/(2!×2!) = 6\n\nThe 6 favorable configurations are:\n1. Doors 1,2 open; 3,4 closed\n2. Doors 1,3 open; 2,4 closed\n3. Doors 1,4 open; 2,3 closed\n4. Doors 2,3 open; 1,4 closed\n5. Doors 2,4 open; 1,3 closed\n6. Doors 3,4 open; 1,2 closed\n\nTherefore: Pr = 6/16 = 3/8\n\n**Step 2: Find the original line equation**\n\nThe original line is: y = 2x - (Pr + 45/8)\n\nSubstituting Pr = 3/8:\ny = 2x - (3/8 + 45/8)\ny = 2x - 48/8\ny = 2x - 6\n\n**Step 3: Translate the line upwards by 4 units**\n\nWhen translating a line upwards by 4 units, we add 4 to the y-value:\ny_new = (2x - 6) + 4\ny_new = 2x - 2\n\n**Step 4: Find the x-intercept of the resulting line**\n\nThe x-intercept occurs when y = 0:\n0 = 2x - 2\n2x = 2\nx = 1\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I calculated the probability that exactly 2 of 4 doors are open. With 4 doors each randomly open or closed, there are 2^4 = 16 total configurations. The number of ways to choose exactly 2 doors to be open is C(4,2) = 6. So Pr = 6/16 = 3/8. The original line equation is y = 2x - (3/8 + 45/8) = 2x - 6. Translating upwards by 4 units gives y = 2x - 2. Setting y = 0 to find the x-intercept: 0 = 2x - 2, so x = 1.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
