  "math_problem": "A candy company makes 5 colors of jellybeans, which come in equal proportions. If I grab a random sample of 5 jellybeans, what is the probability that I get exactly 2 distinct colors? Instead of determining the probability of obtaining exactly two distinct colors in the sample, simply find $k = \\binom{5}{2} + 80$, where $\\binom{5}{2}$ is the number of ways to choose the two distinct colors from the five available. Triangle $\\triangle A B C$ has $A B=(k - 69), B C=(k - 35)$, and $C A=(k - 34)$. There are two points $P$ in the plane of $\\triangle A B C$ for which $\\angle B A P=\\angle C A P$ and $\\angle B P C=k^{\\circ}$. Find the distance between them.",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Find k**\n\nGiven: $k = \\binom{5}{2} + 80$\n\n$\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$\n\nTherefore: $k = 10 + 80 = 90$\n\n**Step 2: Find the side lengths of triangle ABC**\n\n- $AB = k - 69 = 90 - 69 = 21$\n- $BC = k - 35 = 90 - 35 = 55$\n- $CA = k - 34 = 90 - 34 = 56$\n\n**Step 3: Understand the conditions for point P**\n\nWe need points P such that:\n1. $\\angle BAP = \\angle CAP$ (P lies on the angle bisector from A)\n2. $\\angle BPC = k° = 90°$\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the locus of points**\n\n- Since $\\angle BAP = \\angle CAP$, point P lies on the angle bisector of angle A.\n- Since $\\angle BPC = 90°$, point P lies on a circle with diameter BC (by Thales' theorem).\n\nThe two points P are the intersections of:\n- The angle bisector from A\n- The circle with diameter BC\n\n**Step 5: Set up coordinates**\n\nLet me place B at the origin and C on the positive x-axis:\n- $B = (0, 0)$\n- $C = (55, 0)$\n\nThe circle with diameter BC has center at $(27.5, 0)$ and radius $27.5$.\n\n**Step 6: Find position of A**\n\nUsing the distances:\n- $AB = 21$, so A is at distance 21 from B\n- $CA = 56$, so A is at distance 56 from C\n\nLet $A = (x, y)$. Then:\n- $x^2 + y^2 = 21^2 = 441$\n- $(x-55)^2 + y^2 = 56^2 = 3136$\n\nExpanding the second equation:\n$x^2 - 110x + 3025 + y^2 = 3136$\n\nSubstituting $x^2 + y^2 = 441$:\n$441 - 110x + 3025 = 3136$\n$-110x = 3136 - 3466 = -330$\n$x = 3$\n\nFrom $x^2 + y^2 = 441$:\n$9 + y^2 = 441$\n$y^2 = 432$\n$y = 12\\sqrt{3}$ (taking positive y)\n\nSo $A = (3, 12\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n**Step 7: Find the angle bisector from A**\n\nThe angle bisector from A passes through A and divides BC in the ratio $AB:AC = 21:56 = 3:8$.\n\nThe point D on BC where the angle bisector meets BC:\n$D = \\frac{8B + 3C}{11} = \\frac{8(0,0) + 3(55,0)}{11} = (15, 0)$\n\nThe angle bisector is the line from $A = (3, 12\\sqrt{3})$ through $D = (15, 0)$.\n\nDirection vector: $(15-3, 0-12\\sqrt{3}) = (12, -12\\sqrt{3})$\n\nParametric form: $(x, y) = (3, 12\\sqrt{3}) + t(12, -12\\sqrt{3})$\n\n**Step 8: Find intersections with the circle**\n\nCircle equation: $(x - 27.5)^2 + y^2 = 756.25$\n\nSubstituting the parametric equations:\n$x = 3 + 12t$, $y = 12\\sqrt{3} - 12\\sqrt{3}t$\n\n$(3 + 12t - 27.5)^2 + (12\\sqrt{3} - 12\\sqrt{3}t)^2 = 756.25$\n$(12t - 24.5)^2 + 432(1-t)^2 = 756.25$\n$144t^2 - 588t + 600.25 + 432 - 864t + 432t^2 = 756.25$\n$576t^2 - 1452t + 1032.25 = 756.25$\n$576t^2 - 1452t + 276 = 0$\n$48t^2 - 121t + 23 = 0$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$t = \\frac{121 \\pm \\sqrt{121^2 - 4(48)(23)}}{96} = \\frac{121 \\pm \\sqrt{14641 - 4416}}{96} = \\frac{121 \\pm \\sqrt{10225}}{96} = \\frac{121 \\pm 5\\sqrt{409}}{96}$\n\n**Step 9: Find the distance between the two points**\n\nThe distance along the line is $|t_1 - t_2| \\times \\|(12, -12\\sqrt{3})\\|$\n\n$|t_1 - t_2| = \\frac{10\\sqrt{409}}{96} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{409}}{48}$\n\n$\\|(12, -12\\sqrt{3})\\| = 12\\sqrt{1 + 3} = 24$\n\nDistance $= \\frac{5\\sqrt{409}}{48} \\times 24 = \\frac{5\\sqrt{409}}{2}$\n\n{  \n            \"reasoning\": \"First, I calculated k = 10 + 80 = 90. Then found the triangle sides: AB=21, BC=55, CA=56. Points P must lie on both the angle bisector from A and the circle with diameter BC (since angle BPC = 90°). Using coordinates with B at origin and C at (55,0), I found A at (3, 12√3). The angle bisector intersects the circle at two points, and calculating their distance gives 5√409/2.\",\n            \"answer\": \"5√409/2\"\n        }",
