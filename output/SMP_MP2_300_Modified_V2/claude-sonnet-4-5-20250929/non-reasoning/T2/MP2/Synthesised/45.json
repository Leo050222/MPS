  "math_problem": "Define $\\varphi^{k}(n)$ as the number of positive integers that are less than or equal to $n / k$ and relatively prime to $n$. Find $\\phi^{2001}\\left(2002^{2}-1\\right)$. (Hint: $\\phi(2003)=2002$.) Instead of determining $\\varphi^k(n)$ as defined for the given argument and superscript, simply find $q = \\gcd(m, k) + k$, where $k$ is the superscript used in $\\varphi^k(n)$, and $m$ is the positive integer for which the argument of $\\varphi$ is $m^2 - 1$. The real function $f$ has the property that, whenever $a, b, n$ are positive integers such that $a+b=2^{n}$, the equation $f(a)+f(b)=n^{2}$ holds. What is $f(q)$?",

Then I calculated q = gcd(2002, 2001) + 2001 = 1 + 2001 = 2002. To find f(2002), I used the functional equation f(a) + f(b) = n^2 when a + b = 2^n. I decomposed 2002 by finding that 2002 + 46 = 2048 = 2^11, giving f(2002) + f(46) = 121. I continued this process recursively: 46 + 18 = 64 = 2^6, 18 + 14 = 32 = 2^5, 14 + 2 = 16 = 2^4, and 2 + 2 = 4 = 2^2. Starting from f(2) = 2, I worked backwards to find f(14) = 14, f(18) = 11, f(46) = 25, and finally f(2002) = 96.\",\n    \"answer\": \"96\"\n}",
