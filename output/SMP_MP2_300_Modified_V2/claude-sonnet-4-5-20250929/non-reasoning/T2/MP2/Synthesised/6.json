  "math_problem": "Ava and Tiffany participate in a knockout tournament consisting of a total of 32 players. In each of 5 rounds, the remaining players are paired uniformly at random. In each pair, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is knocked out of the tournament. The probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other during the tournament is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of evaluating the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator representing the probability that the two designated players meet during the tournament, simply find $b$, the denominator of that probability when expressed as a reduced fraction. Let $p$ be a real number and $c \\neq 0$ an integer such that $c-0.1<x^{p}\\left(\\frac{1-(1+x)^{(b-6)}}{1+(1+x)^{(b-6)}}\\right)<c+0.1$ for all (positive) real numbers $x$ with $(b-16)<x<10^{-100}$. Find the ordered pair $(p, c)$.",

Let me reconsider...\n\nThe constraint should be $-(b-16) < x$ or the exponent is $(b-6) = 490$.\n\nFor very small positive $x$ (near 0):\n- $(1+x)^{490} \\approx 1 + 490x$ for small $x$\n- $\\frac{1-(1+490x)}{1+(1+490x)} \\approx \\frac{-490x}{2+490x} \\approx -245x$ for small $x$\n- So $x^p \\cdot (-245x) = -245x^{p+1}$\n\nFor this to be bounded near a constant $c$ as $x \\to 0^+$:\n- If $p+1 > 0$: expression → 0, so $c = 0$\n- If $p+1 = 0$: $p = -1$, expression → $-245$, so $c = -245$\n- If $p+1 < 0$: expression → $\\pm\\infty$\n\nGiven the constraint for small $x$, we need $p = -1$ and $c = -245$.\n\n{  \n            \"reasoning\": \"First, I found the probability that Ava and Tiffany meet in the tournament using recursion. For a tournament with 2^n players, P_n = 1/(2^n-1) + (2^n-2)/(2^n-1) · 1/4 · P_{n-1}. Working through: P_5 = 31/496, so b = 496. For the second part, with b = 496, the exponent is 490. For small positive x, (1+x)^490 ≈ 1 + 490x, so the fraction ≈ -490x/(2+490x) ≈ -245x. Thus x^p · (-245x) = -245x^{p+1}. For this to approach a constant as x→0+, we need p+1 = 0, giving p = -1 and c = -245.\",\n            \"answer\": \"(-1, -245)\"\n        }",
