  "math_problem": "Solve the system of equations $p+3q+r=3$, $p+2q+3r=3$, $p+q+r=2$ for the ordered triple $(p, q, r)$. Instead of determining the solution to the linear system, simply find $k = p + \\frac{311}{4}$, where $p$ is the first component of the ordered triple satisfying the system. I have written a strictly increasing sequence of six positive integers, such that each number (besides the first) is a multiple of the one before it, and the sum of all six numbers is $k$. What is the largest number in my sequence?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Solve the system of equations**\n\nGiven:\n- $p + 3q + r = 3$ ... (1)\n- $p + 2q + 3r = 3$ ... (2)\n- $p + q + r = 2$ ... (3)\n\nFrom equations (1) and (3):\n$(p + 3q + r) - (p + q + r) = 3 - 2$\n$2q = 1$\n$q = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nFrom equations (2) and (3):\n$(p + 2q + 3r) - (p + q + r) = 3 - 2$\n$q + 2r = 1$\n$\\frac{1}{2} + 2r = 1$\n$2r = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$r = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nSubstituting into equation (3):\n$p + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 2$\n$p = 2 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{5}{4}$\n\nSo $(p, q, r) = (\\frac{5}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4})$\n\n**Step 2: Find k**\n\n$k = p + \\frac{311}{4} = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{311}{4} = \\frac{316}{4} = 79$\n\n**Step 3: Find the sequence**\n\nI need a strictly increasing sequence of six positive integers where:\n- Each number (besides the first) is a multiple of the one before it\n- The sum equals 79\n\nLet the sequence be $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$ where:\n- $a_2 = m_2 \\cdot a_1$ (with $m_2 \\geq 2$)\n- $a_3 = m_3 \\cdot a_2$ (with $m_3 \\geq 2$)\n- And so on...\n\nThis means: $a_i = a_1 \\cdot m_2 \\cdot m_3 \\cdots m_i$ for $i \\geq 2$\n\nThe sum is:\n$a_1(1 + m_2 + m_2m_3 + m_2m_3m_4 + m_2m_3m_4m_5 + m_2m_3m_4m_5m_6) = 79$\n\nTo maximize $a_6$, we want to maximize $a_1 \\cdot m_2 \\cdot m_3 \\cdot m_4 \\cdot m_5 \\cdot m_6$.\n\nSince 79 is prime, $a_1$ must divide 79, so $a_1 \\in \\{1, 79\\}$.\n\nIf $a_1 = 79$, then the sum would be at least 79, leaving no room for other terms.\n\nSo $a_1 = 1$.\n\nThen: $1 + m_2 + m_2m_3 + m_2m_3m_4 + m_2m_3m_4m_5 + m_2m_3m_4m_5m_6 = 79$\n\nTo maximize the last term, we want to minimize the sum of earlier terms. Using $m_i = 2$ for all:\n$1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 63$\n\nThis gives us room. Let me try $m_2 = m_3 = m_4 = m_5 = 2$ and solve for $m_6$:\n$1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 16m_6 = 79$\n$31 + 16m_6 = 79$\n$16m_6 = 48$\n$m_6 = 3$\n\nSo the sequence is: $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 48$\n\nCheck: $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 48 = 79$ ✓\n\nEach term is a multiple of the previous (2×1=2, 2×2=4, 2×4=8, 2×8=16, 3×16=48) ✓\n\nThe largest number is 48.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I solved the system of equations to find p = 5/4. Then k = 5/4 + 311/4 = 79. For the sequence problem, I need six strictly increasing positive integers where each (except the first) is a multiple of the previous, summing to 79. Starting with a₁ = 1 and using multipliers of 2 for most terms, I found the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 48, which sums to 79.\",\n    \"answer\": \"48\"\n}",
