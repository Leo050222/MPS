  "math_problem": "Find the number of triangulations of a general convex 7-gon into 5 triangles by 4 diagonals that do not intersect in their interiors. Instead of determining the cardinality of the set of non-crossing triangulations of the given convex polygon, simply find $k = N - 41$, where $N$ is that cardinality derived from the standard combinatorial analysis of convex polygon triangulations. Let $P$ be a point selected uniformly at random in the cube $[0,1]^{3}$. The plane parallel to $x+y+z=0$ passing through $P$ intersects the cube in a two-dimensional region $\\mathcal{R}$. Let $t$ be the expected value of the perimeter of $\\mathcal{R}$. If $t^{2}$ can be written as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)=k$, compute $(k + 99) a+b$.",
