  "math_problem": "The fraction $\\frac{1}{2015}$ has a unique \"(restricted) partial fraction decomposition\" of the form $\\frac{1}{2015}=\\frac{a}{5}+\\frac{b}{13}+\\frac{c}{31}$ where $a, b, c$ are integers with $0 \\leq a<5$ and $0 \\leq b<13$. Find $a+b$. Instead of finding the sum of the coefficients corresponding to the two smallest denominators, simply find $L = b + 2004$, where $b$ is the integer coefficient of the term with denominator $13$ in the restricted partial fraction decomposition. Katherine has a piece of string that is $L$ millimeters long. She cuts the string at a location chosen uniformly at random, and takes the left half. She continues this process until the remaining string is less than one millimeter long. What is the expected number of cuts that she makes?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Find the partial fraction decomposition\n\nWe need to find integers $a, b, c$ such that:\n$$\\frac{1}{2015} = \\frac{a}{5} + \\frac{b}{13} + \\frac{c}{31}$$\n\nwhere $0 \\leq a < 5$ and $0 \\leq b < 13$.\n\nFirst, note that $2015 = 5 \\times 13 \\times 31$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2015:\n$$1 = a \\cdot 403 + b \\cdot 155 + c \\cdot 65$$\n\nwhere $403 = \\frac{2015}{5}$, $155 = \\frac{2015}{13}$, and $65 = \\frac{2015}{31}$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve for the coefficients\n\nWe need: $403a + 155b + 65c = 1$\n\nWorking modulo 5: $403a \\equiv 3a \\pmod{5}$, $155b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, $65c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$\nSo $3a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, which gives $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\nSince $0 \\leq a < 5$, we have $a = 2$.\n\nWorking modulo 13: $403a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$, $155b \\equiv 12b \\pmod{13}$, $65c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$\nSo $12b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.\nSince $12 \\times 12 = 144 = 11 \\times 13 + 1$, we have $b \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$.\nSince $0 \\leq b < 13$, we have $b = 12$.\n\nNow we can find $c$:\n$$403(2) + 155(12) + 65c = 1$$\n$$806 + 1860 + 65c = 1$$\n$$2666 + 65c = 1$$\n$$65c = -2665$$\n$$c = -41$$\n\nLet's verify: $403(2) + 155(12) + 65(-41) = 806 + 1860 - 2665 = 1$ ✓\n\n## Step 3: Calculate L\n\n$$L = b + 2004 = 12 + 2004 = 2016$$\n\n## Step 4: Expected number of cuts\n\nKatherine starts with a string of length $L = 2016$ mm. At each step, she cuts at a uniformly random location and keeps the left piece.\n\nLet $X_n$ be the length after $n$ cuts. We have $X_0 = 2016$.\n\nAt each cut, if the current length is $\\ell$, she cuts at position $U \\cdot \\ell$ where $U \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)$, and the new length is $U \\cdot \\ell$.\n\nSo $X_n = U_1 \\cdot U_2 \\cdots U_n \\cdot 2016$ where $U_i$ are independent Uniform(0,1).\n\nShe stops when $X_n < 1$, i.e., when $U_1 \\cdot U_2 \\cdots U_n \\cdot 2016 < 1$.\n\nTaking logarithms: $\\ln(U_1) + \\ln(U_2) + \\cdots + \\ln(U_n) < -\\ln(2016)$.\n\nSince $U \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)$, we have $-\\ln(U) \\sim \\text{Exponential}(1)$.\n\nLet $Y_i = -\\ln(U_i)$. Then $Y_i \\sim \\text{Exponential}(1)$ independently.\n\nWe want the expected value of $N = \\min\\{n : Y_1 + Y_2 + \\cdots + Y_n > \\ln(2016)\\}$.\n\nThis is a renewal process. The expected number of arrivals in time $t$ for a Poisson process with rate 1 is $t$. The expected value of $N$ (the first time the sum exceeds $\\ln(2016)$) is $\\ln(2016) + 1$.\n\nSince $2016 = 2^5 \\times 63 = 32 \\times 63 = 2016$:\n$$\\ln(2016) = \\ln(32 \\times 63) = 5\\ln(2) + \\ln(63)$$\n\nThe expected number of cuts is:\n$$E[N] = \\ln(2016) + 1 = \\ln(2016) + 1$$\n\nSince $2016 = 2^5 \\times 3^2 \\times 7$:\n$$\\ln(2016) \\approx 7.608$$\n\nTherefore: $E[N] = \\ln(2016) + 1 \\approx 8.608$\n\nBut we need the exact answer. The expected number of cuts is $\\boxed{\\ln(2016) + 1}$.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The answer should be numerical. Let me calculate: $\\ln(2016) + 1 \\approx 7.608 + 1 = 8.608$.\n\nActually, for this type of problem, the answer is typically $1 + \\ln(L)$ where the base of logarithm matters. Using natural log: $1 + \\ln(2016)$.\n\n{  \n            \"reasoning\": \"First, I found the partial fraction decomposition by solving 403a + 155b + 65c = 1 with constraints. Working modulo 5 gives a=2, modulo 13 gives b=12, and then c=-41. Thus L = b + 2004 = 2016. For the cutting problem, Katherine cuts at random positions and keeps the left piece. This is equivalent to multiplying by independent Uniform(0,1) random variables. The number of cuts needed follows a renewal process, and the expected number of cuts until the length drops below 1 is 1 + ln(L) = 1 + ln(2016) ≈ 8.608.\",\n            \"answer\": \"8.608\"\n        }",
