  "math_problem": "The set of the first 15 positive integers consists of 5 numbers congruent to 0 modulo 3, 5 congruent to 1 modulo 3, and 5 congruent to 2 modulo 3. What is the probability that a randomly selected set of 5 numbers from this set has a sum divisible by 3? Instead of computing the probability that the sum of the randomly selected set is divisible by 3, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the number of ways to choose all five numbers congruent to 0 modulo 3 plus the number of ways to choose two numbers congruent to 1 modulo 3. I ponder some numbers in bed, all products of three primes I've said, apply $\\phi$ they're still fun: $$n=37^{2} \\cdot 3 \\ldots \\phi(n)= k^{3}+1 ?$$ now k cubed plus one. What numbers could be in my head?",
