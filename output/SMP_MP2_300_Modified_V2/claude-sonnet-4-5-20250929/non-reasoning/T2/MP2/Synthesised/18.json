  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the condition on quadrilateral BXIY\n\nThe incircle touches AB at X and BC at Y. The center is I with radius r.\n\nThe area of quadrilateral BXIY can be computed as:\n- Area(BXIY) = Area(BXI) + Area(BYI)\n- Area(BXI) = (1/2) · BX · r\n- Area(BYI) = (1/2) · BY · r\n- Area(BXIY) = (1/2) · r · (BX + BY)\n\nSince tangent segments from B are equal: BX = BY = s - b, where s is the semiperimeter and b is the side opposite to B (i.e., AC).\n\nSo Area(BXIY) = (1/2) · r · 2(s - b) = r(s - b)\n\nThe area of triangle ABC is Area(ABC) = rs (standard formula).\n\nGiven condition: Area(BXIY) = (2/5) · Area(ABC)\n- r(s - b) = (2/5) · rs\n- s - b = (2/5)s\n- s - b = 2s/5\n- 5(s - b) = 2s\n- 5s - 5b = 2s\n- 3s = 5b\n- s = 5b/3\n\n## Step 2: Finding the minimal perimeter with integer sides\n\nSince s = (a + b + c)/2 and s = 5b/3:\n- (a + b + c)/2 = 5b/3\n- 3(a + b + c) = 10b\n- 3a + 3b + 3c = 10b\n- 3a + 3c = 7b\n- a + c = 7b/3\n\nFor integer sides, we need b to be divisible by 3. Let b = 3k for positive integer k.\nThen: s = 5k and a + c = 7k\n\nThe triangle inequality requires:\n- a + b > c → a + 3k > c\n- b + c > a → 3k + c > a\n- a + c > b → 7k > 3k ✓ (always satisfied)\n\nFrom a + c = 7k:\n- a + 3k > 7k - a → 2a > 4k → a > 2k\n- 3k + (7k - a) > a → 10k > 2a → a < 5k\n\nSo: 2k < a < 5k\n\nThe perimeter is 2s = 10k. The minimal perimeter occurs at k = 1, giving perimeter = 10.\n\nFor k = 1: b = 3, s = 5, a + c = 7, with 2 < a < 5.\nPossible integer values: a = 3, c = 4 or a = 4, c = 3.\n\nTriangle (3, 3, 4) or (4, 3, 3) - same triangle.\n\n## Step 3: Finding s\n\nFor the minimal perimeter p = 10, we have s = 5.\n\n## Step 4: Computing s + 2305\n\ns + 2305 = 5 + 2305 = 2310\n\n## Step 5: Factorizing 2310\n\n2310 = 2 × 1155 = 2 × 3 × 385 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 77 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11\n\nSo 2310 = 2¹ × 3¹ × 5¹ × 7¹ × 11¹\n\n## Step 6: Finding factors n where p(n) is a perfect square\n\nFor a divisor n of 2310, if n = 2^a × 3^b × 5^c × 7^d × 11^e where a,b,c,d,e ∈ {0,1}:\n\nThe number of divisors of n is τ(n) = (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)(d+1)(e+1).\n\nThe product of all divisors is p(n) = n^(τ(n)/2).\n\nFor p(n) to be a perfect square, we need n^(τ(n)/2) to be a perfect square.\n\nThis happens when:\n1. n is a perfect square, OR\n2. τ(n) is divisible by 4\n\nSince 2310 = 2¹ × 3¹ × 5¹ × 7¹ × 11¹, no divisor is a perfect square (all exponents are 0 or 1).\n\nSo we need τ(n) ≡ 0 (mod 4).\n\nτ(n) = (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)(d+1)(e+1) where each factor is either 1 or 2.\n\nFor the product to be divisible by 4, we need at least two factors equal to 2.\n\nThis means at least 2 of {a,b,c,d,e} must equal 1.\n\nThe number of ways to choose at least 2 from 5 primes is:\nC(5,2) + C(5,3) + C(5,4) + C(5,5) = 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 26\n\n{  \n            \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding s (semiperimeter) for the minimal perimeter triangle, then counting divisors of s+2305 where the product of divisors is a perfect square. Through the area condition, we get s=5b/3, leading to minimal perimeter 10 with s=5. Then s+2305=2310=2×3×5×7×11. For p(n) to be a perfect square with n not a perfect square, we need τ(n) divisible by 4, which requires at least 2 prime factors in n. This gives C(5,2)+C(5,3)+C(5,4)+C(5,5)=26 such divisors.\",\n            \"answer\": \"26\"\n        }",
