  "math_problem": "A committee of 5 is to be chosen from a group of 9 people. How many ways can it be chosen, if Bill and Karl must serve together or not at all, and Alice and Jane refuse to serve with each other? Instead of determining the total number of valid committee selections, simply find $k$, the number of valid committees when the must-serve-together pair is excluded and the refusing-to-serve-together pair is both included. An ant starts out at $(k, k)$. Each second, if it is currently at the square $(x, y)$, it can move to $(x-1, y-1),(x-1, y+1),(x+1, y-1)$, or $(x+1, y+1)$. In how many ways can it end up at $((k + 2010),(k + 2010))$ after $(k + 4020)$ seconds?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Part 1: Finding k\n\nWe need to find the number of valid committees when:\n- Bill and Karl are EXCLUDED (the must-serve-together pair is excluded)\n- Alice and Jane are BOTH INCLUDED (the refusing-to-serve-together pair is both included)\n\nWait, let me re-read this carefully. The problem says \"the refusing-to-serve-together pair is both included\" - but Alice and Jane refuse to serve together. This seems contradictory.\n\nLet me interpret this as: we want committees where Bill and Karl are both excluded AND Alice and Jane are both excluded (since they can't serve together, having both included would violate the constraint).\n\nActually, re-reading: \"the refusing-to-serve-together pair is both included\" - this must mean we're counting an impossible scenario, so k = 0.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense for the ant problem. Let me reconsider.\n\nPerhaps the problem means: exclude the Bill-Karl pair (so neither is on the committee) and exclude the Alice-Jane constraint (so we're looking at committees that would have both Alice and Jane, which are invalid).\n\nLet me try another interpretation: We want committees where:\n- Bill and Karl are NOT both on the committee (they're excluded as a pair)\n- Alice and Jane ARE both on the committee (even though they refuse to serve together - we're counting these invalid committees)\n\nIf we exclude Bill and Karl entirely and must include both Alice and Jane:\n- We have Alice and Jane (2 people)\n- We need 3 more from the remaining 5 people (9 - Bill - Karl - Alice - Jane = 5)\n- This gives us C(5,3) = 10\n\nSo k = 10.\n\n## Part 2: Ant Movement Problem\n\nThe ant starts at (10, 10) and needs to reach (10 + 2010, 10 + 2010) = (2020, 2020) in 10 + 4020 = 4030 seconds.\n\nLet's analyze the moves:\n- (x-1, y-1): both coordinates decrease by 1\n- (x-1, y+1): x decreases, y increases\n- (x+1, y-1): x increases, y decreases  \n- (x+1, y+1): both coordinates increase by 1\n\nLet's denote:\n- a = number of (x+1, y+1) moves\n- b = number of (x+1, y-1) moves\n- c = number of (x-1, y+1) moves\n- d = number of (x-1, y-1) moves\n\nConstraints:\n- a + b + c + d = 4030 (total moves)\n- (a + b) - (c + d) = 2010 (net change in x)\n- (a + c) - (b + d) = 2010 (net change in y)\n\nFrom the second equation: a + b = c + d + 2010\nSubstituting into the first: c + d + 2010 + c + d = 4030\nSo: 2(c + d) = 2020, thus c + d = 1010\n\nTherefore: a + b = 2010 + 1010 = 3020\n\nFrom the third equation: a + c = b + d + 2010\nWe have: a + c = b + d + 2010\n\nFrom a + b = 3020, we get b = 3020 - a\nFrom c + d = 1010, we get d = 1010 - c\n\nSubstituting: a + c = (3020 - a) + (1010 - c) + 2010\na + c = 6040 - a - c\n2a + 2c = 6040\na + c = 3020\n\nSo we have:\n- a + b = 3020\n- c + d = 1010\n- a + c = 3020\n\nFrom a + c = 3020 and a + b = 3020, we get b = c.\nFrom c + d = 1010, we get d = 1010 - c.\nFrom a + c = 3020, we get a = 3020 - c.\n\nSo: a = 3020 - c, b = c, d = 1010 - c\n\nWe need c to satisfy: 0 ≤ c ≤ 1010 (so that d ≥ 0)\nAnd: 0 ≤ 3020 - c (so that a ≥ 0), which gives c ≤ 3020\n\nSo c can range from 0 to 1010.\n\nFor each valid value of c, the number of ways to arrange the moves is:\n$$\\frac{4030!}{a! \\cdot b! \\cdot c! \\cdot d!} = \\frac{4030!}{(3020-c)! \\cdot c! \\cdot c! \\cdot (1010-c)!}$$\n\nThe total number of ways is:\n$$\\sum_{c=0}^{1010} \\frac{4030!}{(3020-c)! \\cdot c! \\cdot c! \\cdot (1010-c)!}$$\n\nThis equals:\n$$\\sum_{c=0}^{1010} \\binom{4030}{3020-c, c, c, 1010-c}$$\n\nThis can be simplified to: $\\binom{4030}{3020} \\cdot \\binom{1010}{1010} = \\binom{4030}{3020}$\n\nWait, let me recalculate. Actually, the answer is $\\binom{4030}{1010} \\cdot \\binom{3020}{1010}$.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the answer is $\\binom{4030}{1010}$.\n\n{  \n            \"reasoning\": \"First, I found k=10 by counting committees excluding Bill and Karl while including both Alice and Jane.
