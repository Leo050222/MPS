  "math_problem": "Now a ball is launched from a vertex of an equilateral triangle with side length 5. It strikes the opposite side after traveling a distance of $\\sqrt{19}$. Find the distance from the ball's point of first contact with a wall to the nearest vertex. Instead of finding the distance from the point of first contact to the nearest vertex, simply find $k = d + 199/2$, where $d$ is the distance from the foot of the perpendicular from the launch vertex to the opposite side to the point of first contact. Eric is taking a biology class. His problem sets are worth 100 points in total, his three midterms are worth 100 points each, and his final is worth 300 points. If he gets a perfect score on his problem sets and scores $(k - 40) \\%$, $(k - 30) \\%$, and $(k - 20) \\%$ on his midterms respectively, what is the minimum possible percentage $p$ he can get on his final to ensure a passing grade? (Eric passes if and only if his overall percentage is at least $(k - 30) \\%)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Part 1: Finding k\n\nWe have an equilateral triangle with side length 5. A ball is launched from a vertex and strikes the opposite side after traveling a distance of √19.\n\nLet me set up coordinates. Place the triangle with:\n- Vertex A at the origin (0, 0) - the launch vertex\n- Vertex B at (5, 0)\n- Vertex C at (2.5, 2.5√3)\n\nThe opposite side to vertex A is BC.\n\nThe foot of the perpendicular from A to BC is at the midpoint of BC (by symmetry of equilateral triangle), which is at point D = (3.75, 1.25√3).\n\nWait, let me recalculate. For an equilateral triangle with side 5:\n- Height = (5√3)/2\n- The foot of perpendicular from A to BC is at distance (5√3)/2 from A\n\nActually, let me use a different approach. Place:\n- A at origin (0, 0)\n- B at (5, 0)  \n- C at (5/2, 5√3/2)\n\nThe opposite side BC has midpoint M at ((5 + 5/2)/2, (0 + 5√3/2)/2) = (15/4, 5√3/4).\n\nThe foot of perpendicular from A to BC: In an equilateral triangle, this is at the midpoint of BC, so D = (15/4, 5√3/4).\n\nDistance from A to D = √((15/4)² + (5√3/4)²) = √(225/16 + 75/16) = √(300/16) = √(75/4) = 5√3/2.\n\nNow, the ball travels distance √19 from A to hit BC at some point P.\n\nLet's parameterize: the ball travels in a straight line from A at some angle θ.\nPoint P is at distance √19 from A, so P = (√19 cos θ, √19 sin θ).\n\nP must lie on line BC. The line BC goes from B(5, 0) to C(5/2, 5√3/2).\n\nDirection vector of BC: (-5/2, 5√3/2)\nLine BC can be written as: (x, y) = (5, 0) + t(-5/2, 5√3/2)\n\nFor P to be on BC: √19 cos θ = 5 - 5t/2 and √19 sin θ = 5t√3/2\n\nFrom these: cos θ = (5 - 5t/2)/√19 and sin θ = 5t√3/(2√19)\n\nUsing cos²θ + sin²θ = 1:\n(5 - 5t/2)²/19 + (5t√3/2)²/19 = 1\n(5 - 5t/2)² + 75t²/4 = 19\n25 - 25t + 25t²/4 + 75t²/4 = 19\n25 - 25t + 25t² = 19\n25t² - 25t + 6 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula: t = (25 ± √(625 - 600))/50 = (25 ± 5)/50\n\nSo t = 30/50 = 3/5 or t = 20/50 = 2/5.\n\nFor t = 3/5: P = (5 - 5(3/5)/2, 5(3/5)√3/2) = (5 - 3/2, 3√3/2) = (7/2, 3√3/2)\nFor t = 2/5: P = (5 - 5(2/5)/2, 5(2/5)√3/2) = (5 - 1, √3) = (4, √3)\n\nThe foot of perpendicular D is at (15/4, 5√3/4).\n\nDistance from D to P for t = 3/5:\nd = √((7/2 - 15/4)² + (3√3/2 - 5√3/4)²) = √((14/4 - 15/4)² + (6√3/4 - 5√3/4)²) = √(1/16 + 3/16) = √(4/16) = 1/2\n\nDistance from D to P for t = 2/5:\nd = √((4 - 15/4)² + (√3 - 5√3/4)²) = √((16/4 - 15/4)² + (4√3/4 - 5√3/4)²) = √(1/16 + 3/16) = 1/2\n\nSo d = 1/2.\n\nTherefore: k = d + 199/2 = 1/2 + 199/2 = 200/2 = 100.\n\n## Part 2: Finding minimum percentage p\n\nGiven k = 100:\n- Problem sets: 100 points (perfect score)\n- Midterm 1: (100-40)% = 60% of 100 = 60 points\n- Midterm 2: (100-30)% = 70% of 100 = 70 points\n- Midterm 3: (100-20)% = 80% of 100 = 80 points\n- Final: p% of 300 = 3p points\n\nTotal points = 100 + 60 + 70 + 80 + 3p = 310 + 3p\nTotal possible = 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 300 = 700\n\nPassing grade: (k-30)% = 70% of 700 = 490 points\n\nSo: 310 + 3p ≥ 490\n3p ≥ 180\np ≥ 60\n\nThe minimum percentage is p = 60.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found k by solving the geometry problem. Setting up coordinates for the equilateral triangle and using the constraint that the ball travels √19 from vertex A to hit the opposite side BC, I found that the distance d from the foot of perpendicular to the point of contact is 1/2. Thus k = 1/2 + 199/2 = 100. Then for the biology problem with k=100, Eric needs at least 70% overall (490 out of 700 points). With 310 points already secured from problem sets and midterms, he needs 3p ≥ 180, giving p ≥ 60.\",\n    \"answer\": \"60\"\n}",
