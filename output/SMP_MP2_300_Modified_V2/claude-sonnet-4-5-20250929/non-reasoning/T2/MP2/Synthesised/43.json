  "math_problem": "$a$ and $b$ are integers such that $a+\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{15+\\sqrt{216}}$. Compute $a / b$. Instead of computing the ratio of the integer coefficient to the radicand in the denested form of the nested radical, simply find $k = a + 3$, where $a$ is the integer coefficient in that denested form. Mark has a cursed $k$-sided die that never rolls the same number twice in a row, and all other outcomes are equally likely. Compute the expected number of rolls it takes for Mark to roll every number at least once.",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Denest the nested radical\n\nWe need to find integers $a$ and $b$ such that $a + \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{15 + \\sqrt{216}}$.\n\nFirst, let me simplify $\\sqrt{216}$:\n$\\sqrt{216} = \\sqrt{36 \\cdot 6} = 6\\sqrt{6}$\n\nSo we have: $a + \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{15 + 6\\sqrt{6}}$\n\nTo denest, I'll assume $\\sqrt{15 + 6\\sqrt{6}} = \\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y}$ for some values $x$ and $y$.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n$15 + 6\\sqrt{6} = x + y + 2\\sqrt{xy}$\n\nComparing terms:\n- $x + y = 15$\n- $2\\sqrt{xy} = 6\\sqrt{6}$, so $\\sqrt{xy} = 3\\sqrt{6}$, which gives $xy = 54$\n\nNow I need to find $x$ and $y$ such that $x + y = 15$ and $xy = 54$.\n\nThese are roots of: $t^2 - 15t + 54 = 0$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$t = \\frac{15 \\pm \\sqrt{225 - 216}}{2} = \\frac{15 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{2} = \\frac{15 \\pm 3}{2}$\n\nSo $x = 9$ and $y = 6$ (or vice versa).\n\nTherefore: $\\sqrt{15 + 6\\sqrt{6}} = \\sqrt{9} + \\sqrt{6} = 3 + \\sqrt{6}$\n\nThis means $a = 3$ and $b = 6$.\n\n## Step 2: Find $k$\n\n$k = a + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6$\n\n## Step 3: Solve the die problem\n\nMark has a 6-sided die that never rolls the same number twice in a row. We need to find the expected number of rolls to see all 6 numbers at least once.\n\nLet $E_i$ be the expected number of additional rolls needed when we've already seen $i$ distinct numbers.\n\nWe want to find $E_0$ (starting from scratch).\n\n**When we have seen $i$ distinct numbers:**\n- On the next roll, we cannot roll the number we just rolled (1 number excluded)\n- Of the remaining 5 possible outcomes, $(6-i)$ are new numbers and $(i-1)$ are old numbers we've seen before\n\nThe probability of rolling a new number is $\\frac{6-i}{5}$ (when $i < 6$).\n\nThe expected number of rolls to get a new number follows a geometric distribution:\n$E_i = 1 + \\frac{i-1}{5} \\cdot E_i + \\frac{6-i}{5} \\cdot E_{i+1}$\n\nWait, let me reconsider. After rolling, we move to state $i+1$ if we see a new number, or stay in state $i$ if we see an old number.\n\n$E_i = 1 + \\frac{6-i}{5} \\cdot E_{i+1} + \\frac{i-1}{5} \\cdot E_i$\n\nSolving for $E_i$:\n$E_i - \\frac{i-1}{5} E_i = 1 + \\frac{6-i}{5} E_{i+1}$\n$E_i \\cdot \\frac{6-i}{5} = 1 + \\frac{6-i}{5} E_{i+1}$\n$E_i = \\frac{5}{6-i} + E_{i+1}$\n\nWith boundary condition $E_6 = 0$.\n\nWorking backwards:\n- $E_6 = 0$\n- $E_5 = \\frac{5}{6-5} + E_6 = \\frac{5}{1} + 0 = 5$\n- $E_4 = \\frac{5}{6-4} + E_5 = \\frac{5}{2} + 5 = \\frac{15}{2}$\n- $E_3 = \\frac{5}{6-3} + E_4 = \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{15}{2} = \\frac{10 + 45}{6} = \\frac{55}{6}$\n- $E_2 = \\frac{5}{6-2} + E_3 = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{55}{6} = \\frac{15 + 110}{12} = \\frac{125}{12}$\n- $E_1 = \\frac{5}{6-1} + E_2 = \\frac{5}{5} + \\frac{125}{12} = 1 + \\frac{125}{12} = \\frac{137}{12}$\n\nFor $E_0$, the first roll always gives us a new number, so:\n$E_0 = 1 + E_1 = 1 + \\frac{137}{12} = \\frac{149}{12}$\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I denested the radical √(15+√216) = √(15+6√6) = 3+√6, giving a=3 and b=6.
