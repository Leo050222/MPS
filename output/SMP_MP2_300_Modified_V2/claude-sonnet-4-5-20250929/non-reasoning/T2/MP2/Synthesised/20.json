  "math_problem": "Wendy eats sushi for lunch. She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, labeled as follows:\n\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} A & B & C \\\\ D & E & F \\\\ \\end{array}$\n\nwhere pieces are adjacent if they share a side (not counting diagonally), with adjacencies $A$-$B$, $A$-$D$, $B$-$C$, $B$-$E$, $C$-$F$, $D$-$E$, $E$-$F$. The pieces of sushi are distinguishable. She can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other remaining pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row. Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers randomly (and independently) chosen from the range $[(k - 1),k]$. Find the probability that $a$, $b$ and $k$ form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle.",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the problem structure\n\nThe problem has two parts:\n1. First, find the value of k based on the sushi eating problem\n2. Then, find the probability that a, b, and k form an obtuse triangle\n\n## Step 2: Finding k\n\nThe grid is:\n```\nA - B - C\n|   |   |\nD - E - F\n```\n\nThe problem asks for k = deg(F) + 0, where deg(F) is the degree of F in the induced subgraph after eating \"the two endpoint pieces of the top row.\"\n\nThe two endpoint pieces of the top row are A and C.\n\nAfter removing A and C, the remaining pieces are: B, D, E, F\n\nThe adjacencies in the original graph involving these pieces:\n- B-E (still valid)\n- D-E (still valid)\n- E-F (still valid)\n\nSo in the induced subgraph on {B, D, E, F}:\n- B is adjacent to E\n- D is adjacent to E\n- E is adjacent to B, D, F\n- F is adjacent to E\n\nTherefore, deg(F) = 1 (F is only adjacent to E)\n\nThus, k = deg(F) + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n## Step 3: Finding the probability for the triangle problem\n\nNow we have:\n- k = 1\n- a is randomly chosen from [k-1, k] = [0, 1]\n- b is randomly chosen from [k-1, k] = [0, 1]\n\nWe need to find the probability that a, b, and k = 1 form the sides of an obtuse triangle.\n\nFor three sides to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality:\n- a + b > k = 1\n- a + k > b → a + 1 > b (always true since a ≥ 0 and b ≤ 1)\n- b + k > a → b + 1 > a (always true since b ≥ 0 and a ≤ 1)\n\nSo the triangle inequality requires: a + b > 1\n\nFor an obtuse triangle, one angle must be obtuse. Using the law of cosines, a triangle with sides a, b, c is obtuse if one of these holds:\n- a² + b² < c² (angle opposite to c is obtuse)\n- a² + c² < b² (angle opposite to b is obtuse)\n- b² + c² < a² (angle opposite to a is obtuse)\n\nWith c = k = 1:\n- a² + b² < 1 (angle opposite to side of length 1 is obtuse)\n- a² + 1 < b² → b² > a² + 1 (angle opposite to b is obtuse)\n- b² + 1 < a² → a² > b² + 1 (angle opposite to a is obtuse)\n\nSince a, b ∈ [0, 1], we have a² ≤ 1 and b² ≤ 1.\n- For b² > a² + 1: This requires b² > a² + 1 ≥ 1, so b² > 1, which is impossible.\n- For a² > b² + 1: This requires a² > b² + 1 ≥ 1, so a² > 1, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only way to have an obtuse triangle is: a² + b² < 1\n\n## Step 4: Computing the probability\n\nWe need:\n1. a + b > 1 (triangle inequality)\n2. a² + b² < 1 (obtuse condition)\n\nThe sample space is [0,1] × [0,1] with area 1.\n\nThe region where a + b > 1 is above the line a + b = 1.\nThe region where a² + b² < 1 is inside the quarter circle of radius 1.\n\nWe need the intersection of these two regions.\n\nThe area inside the quarter circle: π/4\nThe area where a + b > 1 in the unit square: 1/2\n\nThe intersection is the region where a + b > 1 AND a² + b² < 1.\n\nThis is the region between the line a + b = 1 and the quarter circle a² + b² = 1 in the first quadrant.\n\nArea = (Area of quarter circle) - (Area of triangle below line a + b = 1 inside circle)\n\nThe line a + b = 1 intersects the circle a² + b² = 1 at (0, 1) and (1, 0).\n\nArea of quarter circle = π/4\nArea of triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) = 1/2\n\nThe area between the line and the arc = π/4 - 1/2\n\nProbability = (π/4 - 1/2) / 1 = π/4 - 1/2\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found k by determining deg(F) after removing endpoints A and C from the top row. In the induced subgraph on {B,D,E,F}, F is only adjacent to E, so deg(F)=1 and k=1. Then with a,b uniformly distributed on [0,1], I needed P(a,b,1 form obtuse triangle). This requires a+b>1 (triangle inequality) and a²+b²<1 (obtuse condition). The probability is the area between line a+b=1 and quarter-circle a²+b²=1, which equals π/4-1/2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"π/4 - 1/2\"\n}",
