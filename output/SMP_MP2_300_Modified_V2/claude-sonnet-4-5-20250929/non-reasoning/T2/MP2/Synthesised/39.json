  "math_problem": "The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to $k>0$, find $k$. Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition. A ladder is leaning against a house with its lower end $d$ feet from the house. When the lower end is pulled $(d - 6)$ feet farther from the house, the upper end slides $(d - 2)$ feet down. How long is the ladder (in feet)?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Finding the width w and then d**\n\nGiven:\n- Length = 3 × width, so l = 3w\n- Perimeter = Area = k\n\nSetting up equations:\n- Perimeter: P = 2(l + w) = 2(3w + w) = 2(4w) = 8w\n- Area: A = l × w = 3w × w = 3w²\n\nSince perimeter equals area:\n8w = 3w²\n3w² - 8w = 0\nw(3w - 8) = 0\n\nSince w > 0, we have:\n3w - 8 = 0\nw = 8/3\n\nNow finding d:\nd = w + 37/3 = 8/3 + 37/3 = 45/3 = 15\n\n**Part 2: Finding the ladder length**\n\nGiven:\n- Initial position: lower end is d = 15 feet from the house\n- Final position: lower end is pulled (d - 6) = 15 - 6 = 9 feet farther, so it's now 15 + 9 = 24 feet from the house\n- The upper end slides (d - 2) = 15 - 2 = 13 feet down\n\nLet:\n- L = length of the ladder (constant)\n- h₁ = initial height where ladder touches the wall\n- h₂ = final height where ladder touches the wall\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nInitial position:\nL² = 15² + h₁²\nL² = 225 + h₁²\n\nFinal position:\nL² = 24² + h₂²\nL² = 576 + h₂²\n\nWe know that h₁ - h₂ = 13 (the ladder slides down 13 feet)\nSo h₁ = h₂ + 13\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:\nL² = 225 + (h₂ + 13)²\nL² = 225 + h₂² + 26h₂ + 169\nL² = 394 + h₂² + 26h₂\n\nFrom the second equation:\nL² = 576 + h₂²\n\nSetting them equal:\n394 + h₂² + 26h₂ = 576 + h₂²\n26h₂ = 576 - 394\n26h₂ = 182\nh₂ = 7\n\nNow finding L:\nL² = 576 + 7²\nL² = 576 + 49\nL² = 625\nL = 25\n\nLet me verify:\n- Initial: 15² + h₁² = 225 + (7+13)² = 225 + 400 = 625 ✓\n- Final: 24² + 7² = 576 + 49 = 625 ✓\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found the width w = 8/3 from the condition that perimeter equals area for a rectangle where length is three times width. Then d = w + 37/3 = 15. Using this value in the ladder problem with Pythagorean theorem for both positions, I found the ladder length is 25 feet.\",\n    \"answer\": \"25\"\n}",
