  "math_problem": "If you roll four fair 6-sided dice, what is the probability that at least three of them will show the same value? Instead of computing the probability that at least three dice show the same value among four rolls, simply find $g = \\binom{4}{3} - 3$, where $\\binom{4}{3}$ is the number of ways to choose which three dice match in the exactly three matching case derived from the event decomposition. The classrooms at MIT are each identified with a positive integer (with no leading zeroes). One day, as President Reif walks down the Infinite Corridor, he notices that a digit zero on a room sign has fallen off. Let $N$ be the original number of the room, and let $M$ be the room number as shown on the sign. The smallest interval containing all possible values of $\\frac{M}{N}$ can be expressed as $\\left[\\frac{a}{b}, \\frac{c}{d}\\right)$ where $a, b, c, d$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=\\operatorname{gcd}(c, d)=g$. Compute $(g + 999) a+(g + 99) b+(g + 9) c+d$.",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Find g\n\nThe problem states: \"simply find $g = \\binom{4}{3} - 3$\"\n\n$g = \\binom{4}{3} - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1$\n\n## Step 2: Understand the room number problem\n\nWhen a digit 0 falls off from room number $N$, we get $M$. We need to find the interval containing all possible values of $\\frac{M}{N}$.\n\nLet's think about what happens when a 0 falls off:\n- If $N$ has a 0 in it, removing that 0 gives us $M$\n- For example: $N = 102 \\rightarrow M = 12$ (removing the middle 0)\n- Or: $N = 120 \\rightarrow M = 12$ (removing the trailing 0)\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the ratio $\\frac{M}{N}$\n\nLet's say $N$ has digits and one of them is 0. When we remove a 0:\n\n**Case 1: 0 is at the end (rightmost position)**\nIf $N = 10k$ for some positive integer $k$, then $M = k$\nSo $\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{k}{10k} = \\frac{1}{10}$\n\n**Case 2: 0 is in the middle**\nIf $N$ has the form $a \\cdot 10^{k+1} + b$ where $0 \\leq b < 10^k$ (the 0 is in position $k$ from the right), then removing the 0 gives:\n$M = a \\cdot 10^k + b$\n\nSo $\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{a \\cdot 10^k + b}{a \\cdot 10^{k+1} + b} = \\frac{a \\cdot 10^k + b}{10a \\cdot 10^k + b}$\n\n## Step 4: Find the minimum value\n\nThe minimum occurs when the 0 is at the rightmost position:\n$\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{1}{10}$\n\n## Step 5: Find the maximum value\n\nFor the maximum, consider when 0 is in the leftmost possible position (second digit from left).\nIf $N = a0b...$ where $a$ is a single digit and $b...$ represents remaining digits.\n\nFor a number like $N = 10...0$ (1 followed by many zeros), removing the first 0 after 1:\n$N = 10^k$, $M = 1 \\cdot 10^{k-1} = 10^{k-1}$\n$\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{10^{k-1}}{10^k} = \\frac{1}{10}$\n\nLet me reconsider. If $N = 101$, then $M = 11$ (removing middle 0), so $\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{11}{101}$\n\nFor maximum, consider $N = 10$ (smallest with trailing 0): $M = 1$, $\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{1}{10}$\n\nActually, let's think differently. If $N = 100...01$ with many zeros, removing the last 0 before 1:\n$N = 10^k + 1$, removing a middle 0 gives approximately $M \\approx 10^{k-1} + 1$\n\nAs $k \\to \\infty$: $\\frac{M}{N} \\to \\frac{10^{k-1}}{10^k} = \\frac{1}{10}$\n\nFor the supremum, consider $N = 101$: $M = 11$, $\\frac{11}{101} \\approx 0.109$\n\nAs we approach $N = 10...01$ with the 0 right after the first 1:\n$N = 10 \\cdot 10^k + 1$, $M = 1 \\cdot 10^k + 1$\n$\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{10^k + 1}{10^{k+1} + 1} \\to \\frac{1}{10}$ as $k \\to \\infty$\n\nBut for small values: $N = 101$, $M = 11$: $\\frac{11}{101}$\n$N = 1001$, $M = 101$: $\\frac{101}{1001}$\n\nThe supremum approaches $\\frac{1}{10}$ from above, so the interval is $\\left[\\frac{1}{10}, \\frac{1}{10}\\right)$... but that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me reconsider: the maximum should be when we remove a 0 that's just after the leading digit.\n$N = 10b$ where $b$ has $k$ digits, $M = 1b$\n$\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{10^k + b}{10^{k+1} + b}$\n\nAs $b \\to 10^k - 1$: $\\frac{M}{N} \\to \\frac{10^k + 10^k - 1}{10 \\cdot 10^k + 10^k - 1} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 10^k - 1}{11 \\cdot 10^k - 1} \\to \\frac{2}{11}$\n\nSo the interval is $\\left[\\frac{1}{10}, \\frac{2}{11}\\right)$\n\nWith $g = 1$: $\\gcd(1,10) = 1$ ✓, $\\gcd(2,11) = 1$ ✓\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final answer\n\n$(g + 999)a + (g + 99)b + (g + 9)c + d$\n$= (1 + 999)(1) + (1 + 99)(10) + (1 + 9)(2) + 11$\n$= 1000(1) + 100(10) + 10(2) + 11$\n$= 1000 + 1000 + 20 + 11$\n$= 2031$\n\n{  \n            \"reasoning\": \"First, I calculated g = C(4,3) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1. Then I analyzed the room number problem where a 0 falls off. The minimum ratio M/N = 1/10 occurs when 0 is at the end (e.g., N=10, M=1). The supremum approaches 2/11 when removing a 0 just after the leading digit in numbers like N=10...0(many 9s), giving M=1(many 9s). The interval is [1/10, 2/11) with a=1, b=10, c=2, d=11, and gcd conditions satisfied with g=1. Finally: (1+999)(1) + (1+99)(10) + (1+9)(2) + 11 = 1000 + 1000 + 20 + 11 = 2031\",\n            \"answer\": \"2031\"\n        }",
