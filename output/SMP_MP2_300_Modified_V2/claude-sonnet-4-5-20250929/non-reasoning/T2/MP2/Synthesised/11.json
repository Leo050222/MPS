  "math_problem": "During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^{2}$. Instead of determining the real part of the square of the starting point, simply find $k = |z| - 1$, where $|z|$ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days. Bob's Rice ID number has six digits, each a number from 1 to 9, and any digit can be used any number of times. The ID number satisfies the following property: the first two digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo $(k + 2)$, the first three digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo $(k + 3)$, the first four digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo $(k + 4)$, the first five digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 5, and the ID number itself is congruent to $k$ modulo 6. One ID number that satisfies this condition is 123252. How many different possibilities are there for Bob's ID number?",
