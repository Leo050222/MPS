  "math_problem": "The following image is 1024 pixels by 1024 pixels, and each pixel is either black or white. The border defines the boundaries of the image, but is not part of the image. Let $a$ be the proportion of pixels that are black. Estimate $A=\\lfloor 10000 a\\rfloor$. An estimate of $E$ will earn $\\left\\lfloor 20 \\min \\left(\\frac{A}{E}, \\frac{E}{A}\\right)^{12}\\right\\rfloor$ points. Instead of estimating the floored scaled proportion of black pixels, simply find $k = N - 1048572$, where $N$ is the total number of pixels. The game of rock-scissors is played just like rock-paper-scissors, except that neither player is allowed to play paper. You play against a poorly-designed computer program that plays rock with $50 \\%$ probability and scissors with $50 \\%$ probability. If you play optimally against the computer, find the probability that after $(k + 4)$ games you have won at least $k$.",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the problem structure\n\nThe problem has two parts:\n1. First, I need to find $k = N - 1048572$ where $N$ is the total number of pixels\n2. Then solve a probability problem about rock-scissors game\n\n## Step 2: Finding k\n\nThe image is 1024 × 1024 pixels.\nTotal number of pixels: $N = 1024 \\times 1024 = 1048576$\n\nTherefore: $k = 1048576 - 1048572 = 4$\n\n## Step 3: Understanding the rock-scissors game\n\nIn rock-scissors:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats rock (wait, that's not right in standard rules)\n\nActually, in rock-paper-scissors:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nBut we're playing rock-scissors (no paper), so:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors loses to rock\n- If both play the same, it's a tie\n\n## Step 4: Optimal strategy\n\nThe computer plays:\n- Rock: 50% probability\n- Scissors: 50% probability\n\nIf I play rock every time:\n- I win when computer plays scissors (50%)\n- I tie when computer plays rock (50%)\n- I never lose\n\nIf I play scissors every time:\n- I lose when computer plays rock (50%)\n- I tie when computer plays scissors (50%)\n- I never win\n\nOptimal strategy: Always play rock.\n\n## Step 5: Probability calculation\n\nWith optimal strategy (always playing rock):\n- Probability of winning any single game: $p = 0.5$\n- Probability of tying any single game: $0.5$\n- Probability of losing: $0$\n\nWe play $k + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8$ games.\n\nWe need to find: P(win at least $k = 4$ games out of 8)\n\nSince each game is either a win (probability 0.5) or a tie (probability 0.5), and we need at least 4 wins:\n\nThis is a binomial problem: $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n=8, p=0.5)$\n\nWe need: $P(X \\geq 4)$\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability\n\n$P(X \\geq 4) = \\sum_{i=4}^{8} \\binom{8}{i} (0.5)^i (0.5)^{8-i} = \\sum_{i=4}^{8} \\binom{8}{i} (0.5)^8$\n\n$= (0.5)^8 \\sum_{i=4}^{8} \\binom{8}{i}$\n\n$= \\frac{1}{256} \\left[\\binom{8}{4} + \\binom{8}{5} + \\binom{8}{6} + \\binom{8}{7} + \\binom{8}{8}\\right]$\n\n$= \\frac{1}{256} [70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1]$\n\n$= \\frac{163}{256}$\n\nLet me verify the binomial coefficients:\n- $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$\n- $\\binom{8}{5} = 56$\n- $\\binom{8}{6} = 28$\n- $\\binom{8}{7} = 8$\n- $\\binom{8}{8} = 1$\n\nSum = 163\n\nTherefore: $P(X \\geq 4) = \\frac{163}{256}$\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The image is 1024×1024 = 1048576 pixels, so k = 1048576 - 1048572 = 4. In rock-scissors with no paper, the optimal strategy against a computer playing 50% rock and 50% scissors is to always play rock, giving a 50% win rate and 50% tie rate per game. After k+4 = 8 games, we need the probability of winning at least k = 4 games. This follows a binomial distribution with n=8 and p=0.5. P(X≥4) = (1/256)[C(8,4) + C(8,5) + C(8,6) + C(8,7) + C(8,8)] = (1/256)[70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1] = 163/256.\",\n    \"answer\": \"163/256\"\n}",
