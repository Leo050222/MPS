  "math_problem": "After walking so much that his feet get really tired, the beaver staggers so that, at each step, his coordinates change by either (+1,+1) or (+1,-1). Now he walks from (0,0) to (8,0) without ever going below the x-axis. How many such paths are there? Instead of counting the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,0) that never go below the x-axis, simply find $k = m - 49$, where $m$ is the number of lattice paths from (0,-2) to (8,0) using steps of (+1,+1) or (+1,-1) derived from the reflection principle to count paths that violate the non-negativity condition. How many multiples of $k$ between $(k + 3)^{6}$ and $(k + 3)^{9}$ are perfect squares?",
  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the problem\n\nWe need to find:\n1. The value of $k = m - 49$, where $m$ is the number of lattice paths from $(0,-2)$ to $(8,0)$ using steps $(+1,+1)$ or $(+1,-1)$\n2. How many multiples of $k$ between $(k+3)^6$ and $(k+3)^9$ are perfect squares\n\n## Step 2: Finding m (paths from (0,-2) to (8,0))\n\nTo go from $(0,-2)$ to $(8,0)$:\n- We need 8 steps in the x-direction (each step increases x by 1)\n- We need to increase y by 2 total (from -2 to 0)\n\nIf we take $u$ steps of $(+1,+1)$ and $d$ steps of $(+1,-1)$:\n- $u + d = 8$ (total steps)\n- $u - d = 2$ (net y-change)\n\nSolving: $u = 5$ and $d = 3$\n\nThe number of such paths is $\\binom{8}{5} = \\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{5!3!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56$\n\nTherefore, $m = 56$\n\n## Step 3: Finding k\n\n$k = m - 49 = 56 - 49 = 7$\n\n## Step 4: Finding multiples of k that are perfect squares\n\nWe need to find multiples of 7 between $(7+3)^6 = 10^6$ and $(7+3)^9 = 10^9$ that are perfect squares.\n\nA multiple of 7 that is a perfect square must be of the form $7n^2$ where $n^2$ is divisible by 7, or more precisely, the multiple must be $49t^2$ for some integer $t$ (since if $7k = m^2$, then $7|m^2$, which means $7|m$, so $m = 7t$ and $7k = 49t^2$, giving $k = 7t^2$).\n\nSo we're looking for numbers of the form $49t^2$ in the range $[10^6, 10^9]$.\n\nFrom $49t^2 \\geq 10^6$:\n$t^2 \\geq \\frac{10^6}{49}$\n$t \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{10^6}{49}} = \\frac{1000}{7} \\approx 142.857$\n\nSo $t \\geq 143$\n\nFrom $49t^2 \\leq 10^9$:\n$t^2 \\leq \\frac{10^9}{49}$\n$t \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{10^9}{49}} = \\frac{31622.776...}{7} \\approx 4517.54$\n\nSo $t \\leq 4517$\n\nWait, let me recalculate: $\\sqrt{10^9/49} = \\sqrt{10^9}/7 = 1000\\sqrt{1000}/7 = 1000 \\times 31.622.../7 \\approx 4517.54$\n\nThe number of integers $t$ from 143 to 4517 inclusive is:\n$4517 - 143 + 1 = 4375$\n\n## Step 5: Verification\n\nLet me verify the bounds:\n- For $t = 143$: $49 \\times 143^2 = 49 \\times 20449 = 1,002,001 > 10^6$ ✓\n- For $t = 142$: $49 \\times 142^2 = 49 \\times 20164 = 988,036 < 10^6$ ✓\n- For $t = 4517$: $49 \\times 4517^2 = 49 \\times 20,403,289 = 999,761,161 < 10^9$ ✓\n- For $t = 4518$: $49 \\times 4518^2 = 49 \\times 20,412,324 = 1,000,203,876 > 10^9$ ✓\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4375.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, I found m = 56 (the number of paths from (0,-2) to (8,0) using steps (+1,+1) or (+1,-1), which requires 5 up-steps and 3 down-steps). Then k = m - 49 = 7. Multiples of 7 that are perfect squares must be of the form 49t^2. Between 10^6 and 10^9, we need 49t^2 >= 10^6 (so t >= 143) and 49t^2 <= 10^9 (so t <= 4517).
