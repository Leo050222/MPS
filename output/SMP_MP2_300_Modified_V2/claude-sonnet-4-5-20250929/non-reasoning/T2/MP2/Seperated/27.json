(2)\n\n**Step 1: Find the difference of the two equations**\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2):\n$(x + y^2 - z) - (x^2 + y - z) = 124 - 100$\n$x + y^2 - z - x^2 - y + z = 24$\n$x - x^2 + y^2 - y = 24$\n$-x^2 + x + y^2 - y = 24$\n$y^2 - y - x^2 + x = 24$\n$y^2 - x^2 - y + x = 24$\n$(y^2 - x^2) + (x - y) = 24$\n$(y - x)(y + x) - (y - x) = 24$\n$(y - x)(y + x - 1) = 24$\n\n**Step 2: Find factor pairs of 24**\n\nLet $a = y - x$ and $b = y + x - 1$, so $ab = 24$.\n\nFrom these: $y = \\frac{a + b + 1}{2}$ and $x = \\frac{b - a + 1}{2}$\n\nFor $x$ and $y$ to be positive integers, we need:\n- $a + b + 1$ is even\n- $b - a + 1$ is even\n- Both expressions yield positive values\n\nThis means $a$ and $b$ must have opposite parity.\n\nFactor pairs of 24 with opposite parity:\n- $(1, 24)$: $y = \\frac{26}{2} = 13$, $x = \\frac{24}{2} = 12$\n- $(3, 8)$: $y = \\frac{12}{2} = 6$, $x = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$\n- $(8, 3)$: $y = \\frac{12}{2} = 6$, $x = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2$ (not positive)\n- $(24, 1)$: $y = \\frac{26}{2} = 13$, $x = \\frac{-22}{2} = -11$ (not positive)\n- $(-1, -24)$: $y = \\frac{-24}{2} = -12$ (not positive)\n- $(-3, -8)$: $y = \\frac{-10}{2} = -5$ (not positive)\n- $(-8, -3)$: $y = \\frac{-10}{2} = -5$ (not positive)\n- $(-24, -1)$: $y = \\frac{-24}{2} = -12$ (not positive)\n\nValid pairs: $(x, y) = (12, 13)$ and $(3, 6)$\n\n**Step 3: Check which pairs satisfy $y > x$**\n\nBoth pairs satisfy $y > x$:\n- $(12, 13)$: $y = 13$\n- $(3, 6)$: $y = 6$\n\nThe smaller value of $y$ is $6$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate $k = y + 18$**\n\n$k = 6 + 18 = 24$\n\n## Problem 2\n\nLet $n = 24$ (the answer to Problem 1).\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of colors needed to color divisors of $(n-24)! = 0! = 1$.\n\nThe only divisor of $1$ is $1$ itself.\n\nSince there's only one divisor, we need only **1 color** to color it, and the condition that no two distinct divisors of the same color satisfy $s \\mid t$ is vacuously satisfied (there are no two distinct divisors).\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The problem asks for the minimum number of colors such that no two distinct divisors $s, t$ of the same color satisfy $s \\mid t$.\n\nFor $1$, which has only one divisor (itself), we need 1 color.\n\nHowever, this seems too simple. Let me verify the answer to Problem 1 is indeed 24.\n\nActually, reviewing Problem 1 more carefully: we found $k = y + 18 = 6 + 18 = 24$.\n\nSo for Problem 2: $(24-24)! = 0! = 1$\n\nThe divisors of 1 are just {1}. We need to color this set such that no two distinct divisors with the same color have one dividing the other. Since there's only one divisor, we need 1 color.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I found the difference of the two equations to get $(y-x)(y+x-1)=24$. Using factor pairs of 24 with opposite parity, I found valid positive integer pairs $(x,y)$ with $y>x$ are $(3,6)$ and $(12,13)$. The smaller value of $y$ is 6, so $k = y + 18 = 24$. For Problem 2, with $n=24$, we need to color divisors of $(24-24)! = 0! = 1$. The only divisor of 1 is 1 itself, requiring only 1 color.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"24\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n        }",
