  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nGiven:\n- Triangle ABC is isosceles with apex A\n- I is the incenter\n- AI = 3\n- Distance from I to BC is 2 (this is the inradius r = 2)\n\nLet me set up coordinates with A at the origin and the altitude from A to BC along the positive y-axis.\n\nSince the triangle is isosceles with apex A, the angle bisector from A is also the altitude and median to BC.\n\nLet's denote:\n- The apex angle at A as 2α\n- The inradius r = 2\n- AI = 3\n\nFor an isosceles triangle with apex A, if Y is the foot of the altitude from A to BC (which is also where the incircle touches BC due to symmetry), then:\n- Y lies on the angle bisector from A\n- The incenter I lies on this angle bisector at distance AI = 3 from A\n- The distance IY = r = 2 (since Y is the point of tangency)\n\nSince I is on the angle bisector from A and Y is below I (toward BC), we have:\nAY = AI + IY = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTherefore:\nd = AY - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1\n\n## Problem 2\n\nWe need to find n such that:\nS(n) = n! - (n-1)! + (n-2)! - (n-3)! + ... ± 1!\n\nLet me factor this expression:\nS(n) = n! - (n-1)! + (n-2)! - (n-3)! + ...\n\nWe can factor out factorials:\n- n! - (n-1)! = (n-1)!(n - 1) = (n-1)!(n-1)\n- So S(n) = (n-1)!(n-1) + (n-2)! - (n-3)! + ...\n- = (n-1)![(n-1) - 1/(n-1)] + (n-2)! - (n-3)! + ...\n\nLet me try small values:\n\nFor n = 3: 3! - 2! + 1! = 6 - 2 + 1 = 5 (prime) ✓\n\nFor n = 4: 4! - 3! + 2! - 1! = 24 - 6 + 2 - 1 = 19 (prime) ✓\n\nFor n = 5: 5! - 4! + 3! - 2! + 1! = 120 - 24 + 6 - 2 + 1 = 101 (prime) ✓\n\nFor n = 6: 6! - 5! + 4! - 3! + 2! - 1! = 720 - 120 + 24 - 6 + 2 - 1 = 619 (prime) ✓\n\nFor larger n, we can use the pattern:\nS(n) = (n-1)! × (n-1) + S(n-2)\n\nFor n ≥ 7, the expression becomes very large and harder to verify primality.\n\nLet me check n = 3 for the scoring:\n- If n = 3: points = n = 3 (since n ≤ 25)\n- If n = 4: points = n = 4\n- If n = 5: points = n = 5\n\nThe problem asks for \"an n\" and mentions being prepared to justify for points. Since n = 3 gives the smallest prime (5), and the scoring formula suggests smaller n might be preferred when n ≤ 25, I'll choose n = 3.\n\nActually, looking at the scoring more carefully: for n ≤ 25, you get n points. For n > 25, you get [(n+225)/10] points. This suggests they want any valid n ≤ 25.\n\nI'll go with n = 5 as it's a nice middle ground and gives the prime 101.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: In an isosceles triangle with apex A, the incenter I lies on the angle bisector from A. The point Y where the incircle touches BC is also on this angle bisector. Since AI = 3 and the inradius r = 2, and Y is the tangency point, we have AY = AI + IY = 3 + 2 = 5. Therefore d = AY - 4 = 1. For Problem 2: Testing small values, n=3 gives 5 (prime), n=4 gives 19 (prime), n=5 gives 101 (prime). I choose n=5 as a valid answer that produces a prime number.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"5\"\n        }",
