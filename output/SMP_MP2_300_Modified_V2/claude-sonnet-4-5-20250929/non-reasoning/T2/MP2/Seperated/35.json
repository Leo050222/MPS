  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1 Analysis\n\nThe problem states: \"Instead of estimating the floored scaled proportion of black pixels, simply find $k = N - 1048572$, where $N$ is the total number of pixels.\"\n\nGiven information:\n- Image is 1024 × 1024 pixels\n- Total number of pixels: $N = 1024 \\times 1024 = 1,048,576$\n\nCalculation:\n$k = N - 1,048,572 = 1,048,576 - 1,048,572 = 4$\n\n## Problem 2 Analysis\n\nIn rock-scissors (no paper allowed):\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors loses to Rock\n- Rock ties with Rock\n- Scissors ties with Scissors\n\nComputer's strategy:\n- Plays Rock with 50% probability\n- Plays Scissors with 50% probability\n\nOptimal player strategy:\nSince the computer plays Rock 50% of the time and Scissors 50% of the time, and Rock beats Scissors, the optimal strategy is to **always play Rock**.\n\nOutcome probabilities when playing Rock:\n- Win (computer plays Scissors): 50%\n- Tie (computer plays Rock): 50%\n- Lose: 0%\n\nAfter 8 games, we need the probability of winning at least 4 games.\n\nLet $X$ be the number of wins in 8 games. Since each game is won with probability $p = 0.5$ (and tied with probability 0.5), $X$ follows a binomial distribution with $n = 8$ and $p = 0.5$.\n\nWe need: $P(X \\geq 4) = \\sum_{k=4}^{8} \\binom{8}{k} (0.5)^k (0.5)^{8-k} = \\sum_{k=4}^{8} \\binom{8}{k} (0.5)^8$\n\nCalculating:\n- $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$\n- $\\binom{8}{5} = 56$\n- $\\binom{8}{6} = 28$\n- $\\binom{8}{7} = 8$\n- $\\binom{8}{8} = 1$\n\nSum: $70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 163$\n\n$P(X \\geq 4) = \\frac{163}{256}$\n\nLet me verify this is in simplest form:\n- $163 = 163$ (prime)\n- $256 = 2^8$\n- $\\gcd(163, 256) = 1$\n\nSo the probability is $\\frac{163}{256}$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The image is 1024×1024 pixels, so N = 1,048,576. Therefore k = 1,048,576 - 1,048,572 = 4. Problem 2: In rock-scissors, the optimal strategy against a computer playing Rock 50% and Scissors 50% is to always play Rock. This wins 50% of games and ties 50%. The number of wins X in 8 games follows Binomial(8, 0.5). P(X ≥ 4) = sum of binomial probabilities for k=4 to 8, which equals (70+56+28+8+1)/256 = 163/256.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"163/256\"\n        }",
