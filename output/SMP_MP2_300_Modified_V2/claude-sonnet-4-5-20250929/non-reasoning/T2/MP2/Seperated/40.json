(3)\n\n**Step 1:** Subtract equation (3) from equation (1)\n$(p+3q+r) - (p+q+r) = 3-2$\n$2q = 1$\n$q = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n**Step 2:** Subtract equation (3) from equation (2)\n$(p+2q+3r) - (p+q+r) = 3-2$\n$q + 2r = 1$\n\nSubstituting $q = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$\\frac{1}{2} + 2r = 1$\n$2r = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$r = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n**Step 3:** Substitute $q = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $r = \\frac{1}{4}$ into equation (3)\n$p + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 2$\n$p + \\frac{3}{4} = 2$\n$p = 2 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{5}{4}$\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate $k = p + \\frac{311}{4}$\n$k = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{311}{4} = \\frac{316}{4} = 79$\n\n## Problem 2: Strictly increasing sequence\n\nLet the six positive integers be $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$ where:\n- Each number (besides the first) is a multiple of the one before it\n- The sequence is strictly increasing\n- Sum = 79\n\nSince each term is a multiple of the previous one, we can write:\n- $a_1 = a_1$\n- $a_2 = m_2 \\cdot a_1$ where $m_2 \\geq 2$ (strictly increasing)\n- $a_3 = m_3 \\cdot a_2 = m_3 m_2 \\cdot a_1$\n- $a_4 = m_4 \\cdot a_3 = m_4 m_3 m_2 \\cdot a_1$\n- $a_5 = m_5 \\cdot a_4 = m_5 m_4 m_3 m_2 \\cdot a_1$\n- $a_6 = m_6 \\cdot a_5 = m_6 m_5 m_4 m_3 m_2 \\cdot a_1$\n\nwhere each $m_i \\geq 2$ for strict increase.\n\nTo maximize $a_6$, we want to minimize the sum while keeping the multipliers as small as possible (all equal to 2) and $a_1$ as small as possible.\n\nIf all multipliers are 2 and $a_1 = 1$:\n$a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 4, a_4 = 8, a_5 = 16, a_6 = 32$\nSum = $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 63$\n\nThis is less than 79, so we need to adjust. The difference is $79 - 63 = 16$.\n\nWe can add 16 to the first term: $a_1 = 1 + 16 = 17$\nThen: $a_1 = 17, a_2 = 34, a_3 = 68, ...$\nSum would be $17(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32) = 17 \\times 63 = 1071$ (too large)\n\nLet me try $a_1 = 1$ with different multipliers:\n- If $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 4, a_4 = 8, a_5 = 16, a_6 = 48$ (multiply by 3 at the end)\n  Sum = $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 48 = 79$ ✓\n\nThis works! The largest number is 48.\n\nLet me verify there's no larger possibility:\n- If $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 4, a_4 = 12, a_5 = 24, a_6 = 48$\n  Sum = $1 + 2 + 4 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 91$ (too large)\n\nSo the answer is 48.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I solved the system by subtracting equations to find q=1/2, r=1/4, p=5/4, then calculated k=p+311/4=79. For Problem 2, I found that with a_1=1 and multipliers of 2,2,2,2,3, the sequence 1,2,4,8,16,48 sums to 79 and maximizes the last term.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"79\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"48\"\n        }",
