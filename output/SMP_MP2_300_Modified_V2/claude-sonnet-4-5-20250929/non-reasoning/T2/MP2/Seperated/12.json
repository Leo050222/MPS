Tunnels are drilled through the pyramid in such a way that one can move from $(x, y, z)$ to any of the 9 points $(x, y, z-1),(x \\pm 1, y, z-1)$, $(x, y \\pm 1, z-1),(x \\pm 1, y \\pm 1, z-1)$. Sean starts at $Y$ and moves randomly down to the base of the pyramid, choosing each of the possible paths with probability $\\frac{1}{9}$ each time. What is the probability that he ends up at the point $(8,9,0)$? Instead of computing the probability of reaching the specified base point, simply find $e = \\left(p_y - \\frac{25}{3}\\right)$, where $p_y$ is the number of steps with positive y-displacement required to achieve the net y-displacement to that point, derived from the total step count and net displacement equations in the y-direction."

To reach (8,9,0) from (0,0,10), he needs net y-displacement of 9. With p_y positive steps, n_y negative steps, and z_y zero steps in y-direction: p_y + n_y + z_y = 10 and p_y - n_y = 9. Solving gives p_y = 9, n_y = 0, z_y = 1. Thus e = p_y - 25/3 = 9 - 25/3 = 2/3. For Problem 2: A person wins if their number m equals 2/3 of the average. This gives S = m(3N-2)/2 where S is the sum of other N-1 numbers. For maximum m, we need m(3N-2)/2 ≤ 100(N-1). Testing m=66: we need N ≥ 34. At N=34, S = 3300 which equals the maximum possible sum of 33 numbers at 100 each. The average is 99 and 2/3 × 99 = 66, confirming m=66 is achievable at N=34.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"2/3\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"34\"\n        }",
