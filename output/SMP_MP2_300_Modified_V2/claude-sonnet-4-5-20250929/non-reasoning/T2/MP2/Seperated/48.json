Given the context of \"exactly 1 cell\" and the structure of the problem, the most natural interpretation is $n = 2$ (the minimal case where we have exactly one pair forming one cell).\n\nTherefore: $k = n + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7$\n\n## Problem 2: Best-of-9 series probability\n\nFor exactly 7 games to be played:\n- One team must win 5 games and the other must win 2 games\n- The winning team must win the 7th game (otherwise the series would have ended earlier)\n- In the first 6 games, the winning team must win exactly 4 games\n\n**Case 1: Mathletes win the series (5-2)**\n- Mathletes win game 7: probability = $\\frac{2}{3}$\n- In first 6 games, Mathletes win exactly 4: $\\binom{6}{4} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2$\n\nProbability for Case 1:\n$$P_1 = \\binom{6}{4} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\binom{6}{4} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2$$\n\n$$P_1 = 15 \\cdot \\frac{32}{243} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} = 15 \\cdot \\frac{32}{2187} = \\frac{480}{2187}$$\n\n**Case 2: Opponents win the series (5-2)**\n- Opponents win game 7: probability = $\\frac{1}{3}$\n- In first 6 games, Opponents win exactly 4: $\\binom{6}{4} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^4 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2$\n\nProbability for Case 2:\n$$P_2 = \\binom{6}{4} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^4 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\binom{6}{4} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^5 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2$$\n\n$$P_2 = 15 \\cdot \\frac{1}{243} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} = 15 \\cdot \\frac{4}{2187} = \\frac{60}{2187}$$\n\n**Total probability:**\n$$P = P_1 + P_2 = \\frac{480}{2187} + \\frac{60}{2187} = \\frac{540}{2187}$$\n\nSimplifying: $\\gcd(540, 2187) = 27$\n$$\\frac{540}{2187} = \\frac{20}{81}$$\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell requires partitioning set A into pairs.
