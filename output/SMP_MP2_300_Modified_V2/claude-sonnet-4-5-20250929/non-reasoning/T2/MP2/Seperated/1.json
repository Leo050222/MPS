  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Jar with Red and Blue Balls\n\nWe start with 8 red balls and 2 blue balls (10 total).\n\nFor there to be more blue balls than red balls at some point, we need:\n- Blue > Red\n- Since Blue + Red = remaining balls, we need Blue > Red means 2×Blue > Total remaining\n\nLet me trace through the possibilities:\n- Start: 8R, 2B (Red > Blue)\n- After 1 removal: Either 7R, 2B or 8R, 1B (Red > Blue in both cases)\n- After 2 removals: Could be 6R, 2B or 7R, 1B or 8R, 0B (Red ≥ Blue)\n- After 3 removals: Could be 5R, 2B or 6R, 1B or 7R, 0B (Red ≥ Blue)\n- After 4 removals: Could be 4R, 2B or 5R, 1B or 6R, 0B (Red ≥ Blue)\n- After 5 removals: Could be 3R, 2B or 4R, 1B or 5R, 0B (Red ≥ Blue)\n- After 6 removals: Could be 2R, 2B or 3R, 1B or 4R, 0B (Red ≥ Blue, tie at 2R, 2B)\n- After 7 removals: Could be 1R, 2B or 2R, 1B or 3R, 0B\n\nThe only way to have Blue > Red is to reach the state (1R, 2B).\n\nTo reach (1R, 2B), we must remove exactly 7 red balls and 0 blue balls in the first 7 draws.\n\nThe probability of this is:\n$$P = \\frac{8}{10} \\times \\frac{7}{9} \\times \\frac{6}{8} \\times \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{4}{6} \\times \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{8!}{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2}{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4}$$\n\n$$= \\frac{2}{10 \\times 9} = \\frac{2}{90} = \\frac{1}{45}$$\n\nSo $a = 1$, $b = 45$, and $\\gcd(1, 45) = 1$.\n\nWait, the problem asks for something different. Let me re-read...\n\nThe problem says: \"Instead of computing 100 times the numerator plus the denominator of the probability expressed in lowest terms, simply find $n$ equal to the greatest common divisor of that numerator and denominator plus 2004.\"\n\nSo we need $\\gcd(a, b) + 2004 = \\gcd(1, 45) + 2004 = 1 + 2004 = 2005$.\n\n## Problem 2: L-Shape Subdivisions\n\nAn L-shape made of 3 congruent squares can be subdivided into 4 smaller L-shapes.\n\nWhen we subdivide an L-shape, we need to understand the orientations:\n- Original L can be in 4 orientations (rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)\n- When subdividing, some smaller L's maintain orientation, others are rotated\n\nLet me denote the number of L's in the original orientation after $n$ subdivisions as $a_n$.\n\nStarting: $a_0 = 1$\n\nAfter one subdivision of an L in the original orientation:\n- We get 4 smaller L's\n- By symmetry analysis, when subdividing an L-shape into 4 smaller ones, typically 1 maintains the original orientation and 3 are in different orientations (one of each of the other 3 rotations).\n\nSo if $a_n$ is the count in original orientation after $n$ subdivisions:\n- Each L in original orientation produces 1 L in original orientation\n- Each L in any other specific orientation also produces 1 L in original orientation (by rotational symmetry)\n\nSince there are 4 orientations total and by symmetry each orientation has the same count:\n$a_n = \\frac{4^n}{4} = 4^{n-1}$\n\nFor $n = 2005$: $a_{2005} = 4^{2004}$\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: To have more blue than red balls, we need to reach state (1R, 2B) by removing 7 red balls first. Probability = 1/45. The problem asks for gcd(1,45) + 2004 = 1 + 2004 = 2005. For Problem 2: By rotational symmetry, when subdividing L-shapes, each of the 4 orientations appears equally often. After 2005 subdivisions with 4^2005 total L-shapes, those in original orientation = 4^2005/4 = 4^2004.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"2005\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"4^2004\"\n        }",
