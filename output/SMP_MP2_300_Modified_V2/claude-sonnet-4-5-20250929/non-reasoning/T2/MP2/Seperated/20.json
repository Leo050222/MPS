She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, but sushi is sticky, and Wendy can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi, assuming that the pieces of sushi are distinguishable? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row."

  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Sushi Eating Order\n\nLet me label the sushi pieces in a 2×3 grid:\n```\nA B C\nD E F\n```\n\nThe constraint is that Wendy can only eat a piece if it's adjacent to at most 2 other pieces.\n\nInitially, the adjacency counts are:\n- A: adjacent to B, D (2 pieces)\n- B: adjacent to A, C, E (3 pieces)\n- C: adjacent to B, F (2 pieces)\n- D: adjacent to A, E (2 pieces)\n- E: adjacent to B, D, F (3 pieces)\n- F: adjacent to C, E (2 pieces)\n\nWendy can initially eat: A, C, D, or F (the corner pieces, each adjacent to exactly 2 pieces).\n\nThe problem asks for a specific calculation: \"find k = deg(F) + 0, where deg(F) is the degree of the bottom-right piece F in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row.\"\n\nThe two endpoint pieces of the top row are A and C.\n\nAfter eating A and C, the remaining pieces are: B, D, E, F\n\nThe adjacencies in the induced subgraph on {B, D, E, F}:\n- B: adjacent to E\n- D: adjacent to E\n- E: adjacent to B, D, F\n- F: adjacent to E\n\nSo deg(F) in this induced subgraph = 1 (F is only adjacent to E)\n\nTherefore, k = deg(F) + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n## Problem 2: Obtuse Triangle Probability\n\nFor three lengths a, b, and 1 to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality:\n- a + b > 1\n- a + 1 > b → always true since a, b ∈ [0,1]\n- b + 1 > a → always true since a, b ∈ [0,1]\n\nSo the only constraint is: a + b > 1\n\nFor the triangle to be obtuse, one of the angles must be greater than 90°. Using the law of cosines, a triangle with sides a, b, c is obtuse if one of these holds:\n- a² + b² < c² (angle opposite to c is obtuse)\n- a² + c² < b² (angle opposite to b is obtuse)\n- b² + c² < a² (angle opposite to a is obtuse)\n\nWith sides a, b, and 1:\n1. Angle opposite to 1 is obtuse: a² + b² < 1\n2. Angle opposite to b is obtuse: a² + 1 < b² → b² > a² + 1 (impossible since b ≤ 1)\n3. Angle opposite to a is obtuse: b² + 1 < a² → a² > b² + 1 (impossible since a ≤ 1)\n\nSo the triangle is obtuse only when a² + b² < 1.\n\nThe region where we have an obtuse triangle:\n- a + b > 1 (triangle inequality)\n- a² + b² < 1 (obtuse condition)\n- 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 1\n\nThe total sample space is the unit square with area 1.\n\nThe region satisfying a + b > 1 is the area above the line a + b = 1, which has area 1/2.\n\nThe region satisfying a² + b² < 1 is a quarter circle with radius 1, which has area π/4.\n\nThe intersection is the region where both conditions hold:\n- a + b > 1\n- a² + b² < 1\n- 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 1\n\nThis is the region between the line a + b = 1 and the quarter circle a² + b² = 1 in the first quadrant.\n\nArea = (Area of quarter circle) - (Area below line a + b = 1 within quarter circle)\n\nThe line a + b = 1 intersects the circle a² + b² = 1 at points (1, 0) and (0, 1).\n\nArea of quarter circle = π/4\n\nArea of the region where a² + b² < 1 AND a + b ≤ 1:\nThis is the quarter circle minus the lens-shaped region.\n\nThe area between the line and the circle = π/4 - 1/2\n\nTherefore, the probability = (π/4 - 1/2)/1 = π/4 - 1/2\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: After eating corner pieces A and C from the top row, piece F has degree 1 in the induced subgraph (only adjacent to E). For Problem 2: The obtuse triangle condition requires a+b>1 (triangle inequality) and a²+b²<1 (obtuse angle opposite to side of length 1). The probability is the area between the quarter circle and the line, which equals π/4 - 1/2.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"π/4 - 1/2\"\n}",
