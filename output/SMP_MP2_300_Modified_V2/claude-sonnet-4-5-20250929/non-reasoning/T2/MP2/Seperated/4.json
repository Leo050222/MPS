  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nWe need to find the probability that the product of two randomly selected integers from 1 to N has a units digit of 0.\n\nA product has a units digit of 0 if and only if it's divisible by 10, which means it must be divisible by both 2 and 5.\n\nLet me analyze the units digits. The units digit of a product depends only on the units digits of the factors.\n\nFor a product to have units digit 0, we need:\n- One number with units digit 5, and the other with an even units digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)\n- OR one number with units digit 0\n\nLet's count by units digits in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0}:\n- Units digit 0: gives product ending in 0 with any other number\n- Units digit 5: gives product ending in 0 with even units digits (2, 4, 6, 8, 0)\n- Even units digits (2, 4, 6, 8): give product ending in 0 with units digit 5\n- Units digit 0: already counted\n\nFor N, let:\n- $n_0$ = count of numbers with units digit 0\n- $n_5$ = count of numbers with units digit 5  \n- $n_e$ = count of numbers with even units digit (2, 4, 6, 8)\n\nFor $N = 10k$: $n_0 = k$, $n_5 = k$, $n_e = 4k$\nFor $N = 10k + r$ where $0 \\leq r < 10$:\n- $n_0 = k$\n- $n_5 = k$ (if $r \\geq 5$) or $k$ (if $r < 5$)\n- $n_e$ depends on how many of {2, 4, 6, 8} are $\\leq r$\n\nThe number of pairs with product ending in 0:\n- Both have units digit 0: $n_0^2$\n- One has 0, other doesn't: $2n_0(N - n_0)$\n- One has 5, other has even (not 0): $2n_5 \\cdot n_e$\n\nTotal: $n_0^2 + 2n_0(N - n_0) + 2n_5 \\cdot n_e = 2n_0 N - n_0^2 + 2n_5 n_e$\n\nSo $p_N = \\frac{2n_0 N - n_0^2 + 2n_5 n_e}{N^2}$\n\nFor $N = 10$: $n_0 = 1, n_5 = 1, n_e = 4$\n$p_{10} = \\frac{2(1)(10) - 1 + 2(1)(4)}{100} = \\frac{20 - 1 + 8}{100} = \\frac{27}{100}$\n\nFor $N = 20$: $n_0 = 2, n_5 = 2, n_e = 8$\n$p_{20} = \\frac{2(2)(20) - 4 + 2(2)(8)}{400} = \\frac{80 - 4 + 32}{400} = \\frac{108}{400} = \\frac{27}{100}$\n\nThe problem asks for an upper bound analysis. As $N \\to \\infty$ with $N = 10k$:\n$p_N = \\frac{2k \\cdot 10k - k^2 + 2k \\cdot 4k}{100k^2} = \\frac{20k^2 - k^2 + 8k^2}{100k^2} = \\frac{27k^2}{100k^2} = \\frac{27}{100}$\n\nSo the maximum is $k = \\frac{27}{100}$.\n\nTherefore: $e = k + \\frac{1973}{100} = \\frac{27}{100} + \\frac{1973}{100} = \\frac{2000}{100} = 20$\n\n## Problem 2\n\nWe need ordered triplets $(a, b, c)$ where $1 \\leq a, b, c \\leq 9$ and $abc$ is divisible by 20.\n\nSince $20 = 4 \\times 5$, we need $abc$ divisible by both 4 and 5.\n\nFor divisibility by 5: at least one of $a, b, c$ must be 5.\nFor divisibility by 4: the product must be divisible by 4.\n\nTotal triplets: $9^3 = 729$\n\nTriplets with at least one 5: $729 - 8^3 = 729 - 512 = 217$\n\nAmong these 217, we need those divisible by 4.\n\nIf exactly one is 5, the other two must have product divisible by 4.\nPairs $(x,y)$ from {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9} with $xy \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$:\n- At least one is divisible by 4: {4, 8}\n- Or both are even: {2, 6}\n\nCount: Pairs with at least one from {4,8}: $2 \\cdot 8 + 2 \\cdot 8 - 2 \\cdot 2 = 28$\nPlus pairs from {2,6}: $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$\nTotal: 32 pairs\n\nWith one 5 in 3 positions: $3 \\times 32 = 96$\n\nIf exactly two are 5, the third must be even: {2, 4, 6, 8} = 4 choices\nPositions: $3 \\times 4 = 12$\n\nIf all three are 5: 1 triplet\n\nTotal: $96 + 12 + 1 = 109$\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I analyzed the probability that a product has units digit 0, finding it maximizes at 27/100 for N=10k.
