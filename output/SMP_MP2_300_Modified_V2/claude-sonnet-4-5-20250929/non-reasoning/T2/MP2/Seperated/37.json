Then $b + d + 4 = \\ell$ (since $XY = 4$).\n\nPower of point $X$: $6(\\ell - 6) = bd$\nPower of point $Y$: Let $BY = b + 4$ and $YD = d - 4$ (assuming $Y$ is between $X$ and $D$).\nThen $(b + 4)(d - 4) = 7(\\ell - 7)$\n\nFrom the first equation: $bd = 6\\ell - 36$\nFrom $b + d = \\ell - 4$: $d = \\ell - 4 - b$\n\nSubstituting: $b(\\ell - 4 - b) = 6\\ell - 36$\n$b\\ell - 4b - b^2 = 6\\ell - 36$\n$b^2 - b\\ell + 4b + 6\\ell - 36 = 0$\n\nFrom the second power equation:\n$(b + 4)(d - 4) = 7\\ell - 49$\n$bd - 4b + 4d - 16 = 7\\ell - 49$\n$6\\ell - 36 - 4b + 4d - 16 = 7\\ell - 49$\n$-4b + 4d = \\ell + 3$\n$d - b = \\frac{\\ell + 3}{4}$\n\nCombined with $b + d = \\ell - 4$:\n$2d = \\ell - 4 + \\frac{\\ell + 3}{4} = \\frac{5\\ell - 13}{4}$\n$d = \\frac{5\\ell - 13}{8}$\n\n$2b = \\ell - 4 - \\frac{\\ell + 3}{4} = \\frac{3\\ell - 19}{4}$\n$b = \\frac{3\\ell - 19}{8}$\n\nUsing $bd = 6\\ell - 36$:\n$\\frac{(3\\ell - 19)(5\\ell - 13)}{64} = 6\\ell - 36$\n$(3\\ell - 19)(5\\ell - 13) = 384\\ell - 2304$\n$15\\ell^2 - 39\\ell - 95\\ell + 247 = 384\\ell - 2304$\n$15\\ell^2 - 518\\ell + 2551 = 0$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$\\ell = \\frac{518 \\pm \\sqrt{268324 - 153060}}{30} = \\frac{518 \\pm \\sqrt{115264}}{30} = \\frac{518 \\pm 339.5...}{30}$\n\nLet me recalculate: $\\sqrt{115264} = \\sqrt{16 \\cdot 7204} = 4\\sqrt{7204}$\n\nActually, $15\\ell^2 - 518\\ell + 2551 = 0$\n$\\ell = \\frac{518 \\pm \\sqrt{268324 - 153060}}{30} = \\frac{518 \\pm \\sqrt{115264}}{30}$\n\n$\\sqrt{115264} = 4\\sqrt{7204} = 4 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{1801} = 8\\sqrt{1801}$...

The circle is tangent to $AB$ at $E$, so the center is at $(e, r) = (e, \\frac{32}{49})$.\n\nThe circle passes through $D = (0,1)$:\n$e^2 + (1 - \\frac{32}{49})^2 = r^2 = (\\frac{32}{49})^2$\n$e^2 + (\\frac{17}{49})^2 = (\\frac{32}{49})^2$\n$e^2 = \\frac{1024 - 289}{2401} = \\frac{735}{2401} = \\frac{735}{2401} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 49}{2401} = \\frac{735}{49^2}$\n$e = \\frac{\\sqrt{735}}{49} = \\frac{7\\sqrt{15}}{49} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{7}$\n\n$DE = \\sqrt{e^2 + 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{735}{2401} + 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3136}{2401}} = \\frac{56}{49} = \\frac{8}{7}$\n\nSo $m = 8$, $n = 7$, and $100m + n = 807$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, using power of a point and the constraint equations, I find the common chord length.
