  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Tournament Probability\n\nWe need to find the probability that Ava and Tiffany meet during a 32-player knockout tournament.\n\n**Approach:** Let's think about when they DON'T meet. They don't meet if and only if one of them gets knocked out before they can play each other.\n\n**Alternative approach:** The probability they meet in round $k$ equals the probability they both survive to round $k$ AND get paired in round $k$.\n\nLet me use a cleaner approach: In each round, if both players are still in, what's the probability they meet?\n\n- Round 1: 32 players → 16 pairs. P(paired) = 1/31\n- Round 2: 16 players → 8 pairs. P(paired | both survive) = 1/15\n- Round 3: 8 players → 4 pairs. P(paired | both survive) = 1/7\n- Round 4: 4 players → 2 pairs. P(paired | both survive) = 1/3\n- Round 5: 2 players → 1 pair. P(paired | both survive) = 1/1\n\nThe probability they meet in round $k$ is:\n- P(both survive to round $k$) × P(paired in round $k$)\n\nP(both survive to round $k$) = $(1/2)^{k-1} \\times (1/2)^{k-1} \\times$ P(not paired before round $k$)\n\nActually, let's use the complement. P(they meet) = 1 - P(they never meet).\n\nBetter approach: Let $P_n$ be the probability that two specific players meet in a tournament with $n$ players.\n\nFor $n$ players:\n- P(meet in round 1) = $\\frac{1}{n-1}$\n- P(don't meet in round 1) = $\\frac{n-2}{n-1}$\n- If they don't meet in round 1, each survives with probability 1/2\n- P(both survive round 1 | don't meet) = 1/4\n\nSo: $P_n = \\frac{1}{n-1} + \\frac{n-2}{n-1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot P_{n/2}$\n\nFor $n=32$:\n$P_{32} = \\frac{1}{31} + \\frac{30}{31} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot P_{16}$\n\n$P_{16} = \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{14}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot P_8$\n\n$P_8 = \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot P_4$\n\n$P_4 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot P_2$\n\n$P_2 = 1$\n\nWorking backwards:\n$P_4 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$P_8 = \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{3}{28} = \\frac{4}{28} + \\frac{3}{28} = \\frac{7}{28} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n$P_{16} = \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{14}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{14}{240} = \\frac{16}{240} + \\frac{14}{240} = \\frac{30}{240} = \\frac{1}{8}$\n\n$P_{32} = \\frac{1}{31} + \\frac{30}{31} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{31} + \\frac{30}{992} = \\frac{32}{992} + \\frac{30}{992} = \\frac{62}{992} = \\frac{31}{496}$\n\nSo $a = 31$, $b = 496$, and $e = b - 16 = 496 - 16 = 480$.\n\n## Problem 2: Asymptotic Analysis\n\nWe need to analyze $f(x) = x^p \\cdot \\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}}$ for small $x$.\n\nFor small $x$: $(1+x)^{10} \\approx 1 + 10x + 45x^2 + ...$\n\n$\\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}} = \\frac{-10x - 45x^2 - ...}{2 + 10x + 45x^2 + ...} \\approx \\frac{-10x}{2} = -5x$ (to leading order)\n\nSo $f(x) \\approx x^p \\cdot (-5x) = -5x^{p+1}$\n\nFor this to be bounded near 0 and approach an integer $c$, we need $p+1 = 0$, so $p = -1$.\n\nWith $p = -1$: $f(x) = x^{-1} \\cdot \\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}} = \\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{x(1+(1+x)^{10})}$\n\nUsing L'Hôpital or Taylor expansion more carefully:\n$\\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{x} = \\frac{-10(1+x)^9 \\cdot 1}{1} \\to -10$ as $x \\to 0$\n\nAnd $\\frac{1}{1+(1+x)^{10}} \\to \\frac{1}{2}$ as $x \\to 0$\n\nSo $f(x) \\to -10 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = -5$ as $x \\to 0$.\n\nTherefore $(p, c) = (-1, -5)$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I used a recursive formula for the probability that two players meet in a knockout tournament.
