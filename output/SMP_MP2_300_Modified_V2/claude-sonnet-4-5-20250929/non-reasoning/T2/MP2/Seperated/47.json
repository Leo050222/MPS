The problem says \"What numbers could be in my head?\" (plural), so let me check if there are other interpretations.\n\nThe constraint is $n = 37^2 \\cdot p$ where $p$ is prime, and we found $p = 2$.\n\nSo the answer is $n = 2738$ or we could express it as $37^2 \\cdot 2$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: I categorized integers 1-15 by residue mod 3 (5 in each class). Ways to choose all 5 from class 0: C(5,5)=1. Ways to choose exactly 2 from class 1: C(5,2)×C(10,3)=10×120=1200. Total k=1+1200=1201. For Problem 2: Given n=37²·p with φ(n)=11³+1=1332. Since φ(37²)=37(36)=1332, we need φ(p)=1, which means p-1=1, so p=2. Therefore n=37²·2=2738.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"1201\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"2738\"\n        }",
