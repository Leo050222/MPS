  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nThe problem asks me to find $k = \\binom{5}{2} + 80$.\n\nFirst, I calculate $\\binom{5}{2}$:\n$$\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$k = 10 + 80 = 90$$\n\n## Problem 2\n\nGiven triangle $\\triangle ABC$ with $AB = 21$, $BC = 55$, and $CA = 56$.\n\nWe need to find two points $P$ such that:\n1. $\\angle BAP = \\angle CAP$ (meaning $P$ lies on the angle bisector of $\\angle A$)\n2. $\\angle BPC = 90°$ (meaning $P$ lies on the circle with diameter $BC$)\n\n**Step 1: Set up coordinates**\n\nLet me place $B$ at the origin and $C$ at $(55, 0)$.\n\n**Step 2: Find position of $A$**\n\nUsing the distances:\n- $AB = 21$, so $A$ is at distance 21 from $B = (0,0)$\n- $AC = 56$, so $A$ is at distance 56 from $C = (55,0)$\n\nLet $A = (x, y)$. Then:\n- $x^2 + y^2 = 21^2 = 441$\n- $(x-55)^2 + y^2 = 56^2 = 3136$\n\nExpanding the second equation:\n$$x^2 - 110x + 3025 + y^2 = 3136$$\n$$x^2 + y^2 = 3136 - 3025 + 110x = 111 + 110x$$\n\nFrom the first equation: $x^2 + y^2 = 441$\n\nTherefore: $441 = 111 + 110x$, which gives $110x = 330$, so $x = 3$.\n\nThen $y^2 = 441 - 9 = 432$, so $y = 12\\sqrt{3}$ (taking positive $y$).\n\nThus $A = (3, 12\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the angle bisector of $\\angle A$**\n\nThe angle bisector from $A$ divides the opposite side $BC$ in the ratio $AB:AC = 21:56 = 3:8$.\n\nThe point $D$ on $BC$ where the angle bisector meets is:\n$$D = \\frac{8B + 3C}{11} = \\frac{8(0,0) + 3(55,0)}{11} = \\frac{(165,0)}{11} = (15, 0)$$\n\nThe angle bisector is the line through $A = (3, 12\\sqrt{3})$ and $D = (15, 0)$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the circle with diameter $BC$**\n\nThe circle has center at the midpoint of $BC$: $(27.5, 0)$ and radius $27.5$.\n\nEquation: $(x - 27.5)^2 + y^2 = 27.5^2 = 756.25$\n\n**Step 5: Find intersection points**\n\nThe angle bisector can be parameterized as:\n$$P = A + t(D - A) = (3, 12\\sqrt{3}) + t(12, -12\\sqrt{3})$$\n$$P = (3 + 12t, 12\\sqrt{3}(1-t))$$\n\nSubstituting into the circle equation:\n$$(3 + 12t - 27.5)^2 + (12\\sqrt{3}(1-t))^2 = 756.25$$\n$$(12t - 24.5)^2 + 432(1-t)^2 = 756.25$$\n$$144t^2 - 588t + 600.25 + 432 - 864t + 432t^2 = 756.25$$\n$$576t^2 - 1452t + 1032.25 = 756.25$$\n$$576t^2 - 1452t + 276 = 0$$\n$$48t^2 - 121t + 23 = 0$$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$$t = \\frac{121 \\pm \\sqrt{121^2 - 4(48)(23)}}{96} = \\frac{121 \\pm \\sqrt{14641 - 4416}}{96} = \\frac{121 \\pm \\sqrt{10225}}{96}$$\n\nSince $\\sqrt{10225} = 5\\sqrt{409}$:\n$$t = \\frac{121 \\pm 5\\sqrt{409}}{96}$$\n\n**Step 6: Find distance between the two points**\n\nThe two values of $t$ differ by $\\frac{10\\sqrt{409}}{96} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{409}}{48}$.\n\nThe distance between the two points is:\n$$|t_1 - t_2| \\times |D - A| = \\frac{10\\sqrt{409}}{96} \\times \\sqrt{12^2 + (12\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{409}}{96} \\times 24 = \\frac{240\\sqrt{409}}{96} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{409}}{2}$$\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I calculated the binomial coefficient and added 80.
