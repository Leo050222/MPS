Now he walks from $(0,0)$ to $(8,0)$ without ever going below the $x$-axis. How many such paths are there? Instead of counting the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,0) that never go below the x-axis, simply find $k = m - 49$, where $m$ is the number of lattice paths from (0,-2) to (8,0) using steps of (+1,+1) or (+1,-1) derived from the reflection principle to count paths that violate the non-negativity condition."

This means 7 | m (since 7 is prime).\n\nSo m = 7j for some integer j, which gives n = (7j)² = 49j².\n\nWe need: 10^6 ≤ 49j² ≤ 10^9\n\nDividing by 49:\n10^6/49 ≤ j² ≤ 10^9/49\n\nTaking square roots:\n√(10^6/49) ≤ j ≤ √(10^9/49)\n\nCalculating:\n- √(10^6/49) = 10³/7 = 1000/7 ≈ 142.857...\n- √(10^9/49) = 10^4.5/7 = √(10^9)/7 = 31622.776.../7 ≈ 4517.539...\n\nSince j must be an integer:\n- Minimum j: ⌈1000/7⌉ = ⌈142.857...⌉ = 143\n- Maximum j: ⌊√(10^9/49)⌋ = ⌊4517.539...⌋ = 4517\n\nLet me verify the bounds:\n- For j = 143: n = 49 × 143² = 49 × 20449 = 1,002,001 ✓ (≥ 10^6)\n- For j = 142: n = 49 × 142² = 49 × 20164 = 988,036 ✗ (< 10^6)\n- For j = 4517: n = 49 × 4517² = 49 × 20,403,289 = 999,761,161 ✓ (< 10^9)\n- For j = 4518: n = 49 × 4518² = 49 × 20,412,324 = 1,000,203,876 ✗ (> 10^9)\n\nThe number of valid values of j is:\n4517 - 143 + 1 = 4375\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I calculated the number of paths from (0,-2) to (8,0) using the binomial coefficient. With 8 steps total and needing 5 up-steps and 3 down-steps, m = C(8,5) = 56. Therefore k = m - 49 = 7. For Problem 2, multiples of 7 that are perfect squares must be of the form 49j².
