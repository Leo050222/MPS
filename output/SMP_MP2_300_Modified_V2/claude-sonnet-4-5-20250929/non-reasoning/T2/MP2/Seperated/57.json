  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Triangulations of a convex 7-gon\n\nFor a convex n-gon, the number of triangulations is given by the Catalan number $C_{n-2}$.\n\nFor a 7-gon (heptagon), we need $C_{7-2} = C_5$.\n\nThe nth Catalan number is: $C_n = \\frac{1}{n+1}\\binom{2n}{n}$\n\nFor $C_5$:\n$$C_5 = \\frac{1}{6}\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{10!}{5! \\cdot 5!} = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 252 = 42$$\n\nSo $N = 42$.\n\nTherefore: $k = N - 41 = 42 - 41 = 1$\n\n## Problem 2: Expected perimeter of cross-section\n\nA plane parallel to $x+y+z=0$ has the form $x+y+z=c$ for some constant $c$.\n\nFor a point $P = (x_0, y_0, z_0)$ uniformly distributed in $[0,1]^3$, we have $c = x_0 + y_0 + z_0$.\n\nThe sum $c = x_0 + y_0 + z_0$ follows the Irwin-Hall distribution. Since each coordinate is uniform on $[0,1]$, $c$ ranges from 0 to 3.\n\nThe plane $x+y+z=c$ intersects the cube $[0,1]^3$ in different polygonal shapes depending on $c$:\n- For $c \\in [0,1]$: triangle\n- For $c \\in [1,2]$: hexagon\n- For $c \\in [2,3]$: triangle\n\nBy symmetry, the distribution is symmetric about $c = 1.5$.\n\nFor the plane $x+y+z=c$ intersecting the unit cube:\n\n**Case 1: $c \\in [0,1]$** - Triangle with vertices at $(c,0,0)$, $(0,c,0)$, $(0,0,c)$\n- Each edge has length $\\sqrt{2}c$\n- Perimeter: $P(c) = 3\\sqrt{2}c$\n\n**Case 2: $c \\in [1,2]$** - Hexagon\n- The vertices are at the intersections with the edges of the cube\n- Perimeter: $P(c) = 3\\sqrt{2}(2-c) + 3\\sqrt{2}c = 3\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 2 = 6\\sqrt{2}$\n\nWait, let me recalculate more carefully.\n\nFor $c \\in [1,2]$, the hexagon has vertices where the plane intersects the 12 edges of the cube. The perimeter is constant at $3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nActually, for $c \\in [1,2]$, the cross-section is a hexagon with perimeter $3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n**Case 3: $c \\in [2,3]$** - Triangle (by symmetry with Case 1)\n- Perimeter: $P(c) = 3\\sqrt{2}(3-c)$\n\nThe PDF of $c$ is:\n- $f(c) = \\frac{c^2}{2}$ for $c \\in [0,1]$\n- $f(c) = \\frac{3c^2 - 12c + 12}{4}$ for $c \\in [1,2]$\n- $f(c) = \\frac{(3-c)^2}{2}$ for $c \\in [2,3]$\n\nExpected perimeter:\n$$t = \\int_0^1 3\\sqrt{2}c \\cdot \\frac{c^2}{2} dc + \\int_1^2 3\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{3c^2-12c+12}{4} dc + \\int_2^3 3\\sqrt{2}(3-c) \\cdot \\frac{(3-c)^2}{2} dc$$\n\nBy symmetry, the first and third integrals are equal.\n\n$$t = 2 \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\int_0^1 c^3 dc + \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\int_1^2 (3c^2-12c+12) dc$$\n\n$$= 3\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4} + \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}$$\n\nTherefore: $t^2 = \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9 \\cdot 2}{4} = \\frac{9}{2}$\n\nSo $a = 9$, $b = 2$, and $\\gcd(9,2) = 1$.\n\nAnswer: $100a + b = 100(9) + 2 = 902$\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: The number of triangulations of a convex n-gon is the Catalan number C_{n-2}.
