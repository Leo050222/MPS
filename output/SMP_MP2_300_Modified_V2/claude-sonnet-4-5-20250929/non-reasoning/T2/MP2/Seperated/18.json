  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nLet me denote the sides of triangle ABC as $a = BC$, $b = CA$, $c = AB$, with semiperimeter $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$ and inradius $r$.\n\nThe incircle touches $AB$ at $X$ and $BC$ at $Y$. By properties of tangent lines:\n- $BX = BY = s - b$ (where $b = CA$)\n\nThe area of quadrilateral $BXIY$ can be computed as the sum of triangles $BXI$ and $BYI$:\n- Area of $\\triangle BXI = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot BX \\cdot r = \\frac{1}{2}(s-b)r$\n- Area of $\\triangle BYI = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot BY \\cdot r = \\frac{1}{2}(s-b)r$\n- Area of $BXIY = (s-b)r$\n\nThe area of $\\triangle ABC = sr$.\n\nGiven condition: $(s-b)r = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot sr$\n\nThis gives us: $s - b = \\frac{2s}{5}$, so $b = \\frac{3s}{5}$\n\nSince $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$, we have:\n$s = \\frac{a + \\frac{3s}{5} + c}{2}$\n$2s = a + \\frac{3s}{5} + c$\n$\\frac{7s}{5} = a + c$\n\nSo we need: $b = \\frac{3s}{5}$ and $a + c = \\frac{7s}{5}$\n\nFor integer sides, we need $s$ to be a multiple of 5. Let $s = 5k$ for positive integer $k$.\nThen $b = 3k$ and $a + c = 7k$.\n\nThe perimeter is $2s = 10k$.\n\nFor a valid triangle, we need the triangle inequality:\n- $a + b > c \\Rightarrow a + 3k > c$\n- $b + c > a \\Rightarrow 3k + c > a$\n- $a + c > b \\Rightarrow a + c > 3k$, which gives $7k > 3k$ ✓\n\nFrom $a + c = 7k$ and $a + 3k > c$, we get $a + 3k > 7k - a$, so $2a > 4k$, thus $a > 2k$.\nFrom $3k + c > a$ and $a + c = 7k$, we get $3k + c > 7k - c$, so $2c > 4k$, thus $c > 2k$.\n\nSince $a + c = 7k$ and both $a, c > 2k$, we need $a, c \\in \\{2k+1, 2k+2, ..., 7k-2k-1\\} = \\{2k+1, ..., 5k-1\\}$.\n\nThe smallest perimeter occurs at $k = 1$: $s = 5$, perimeter $= 10$.\nWith $b = 3$, $a + c = 7$, and $a, c > 2$, we have possibilities like $(a,c) = (3,4)$ or $(4,3)$.\n\nTriangle $(3, 3, 4)$ has $s = 5$.\n\nTherefore, $e = s + 2305 = 5 + 2305 = 2310$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nFor $n = 2310 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11$, any divisor has the form $n = 2^{a_1} \\cdot 3^{a_2} \\cdot 5^{a_3} \\cdot 7^{a_4} \\cdot 11^{a_5}$ where $a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nIf $n$ has $d(n)$ divisors, then $p(n) = n^{d(n)/2}$.\n\nFor $p(n)$ to be a perfect square, we need $n^{d(n)/2}$ to be a perfect square.\n\nIf $n = \\prod p_i^{a_i}$, then $d(n) = \\prod (a_i + 1)$.\n\nFor $p(n) = n^{d(n)/2}$ to be a perfect square:\n- If $d(n)$ is even, then $d(n)/2$ is an integer, and we need $n$ to be a perfect square (all $a_i$ even) OR $d(n)/2$ to be even.\n- If $d(n)$ is odd, then $n^{d(n)/2} = n^{(d(n)-1)/2} \\cdot \\sqrt{n}$, so we need $n$ to be a perfect square.\n\nFor divisors of $2310$, each $a_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, so $n$ is a perfect square only when all $a_i = 0$ (i.e., $n=1$).\n\n$d(n) = \\prod_{i=1}^5 (a_i + 1)$ where each factor is either 1 or 2.\n\n$d(n)$ is odd iff all $(a_i + 1) = 1$, which means all $a_i = 0$, so $n = 1$.\n\nFor $n \\neq 1$, $d(n)$ is even. We need $d(n)/2$ to be even, i.e., $d(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n\n$d(n) = 2^k$ where $k$ is the number of primes dividing $n$.\nWe need $2^k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, so $k \\geq 2$.\n\nThe number of divisors with at least 2 prime factors is $\\binom{5}{2} + \\binom{5}{3} + \\binom{5}{4} + \\binom{5}{5} = 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 26$.\n\nIncluding $n = 1$, the answer is $26 + 1 = 27$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Using the incircle tangent properties and area condition, I derived that b = 3s/5 and a+c = 7s/5. For integer sides, s must be a multiple of 5. The smallest such triangle has s=5 with sides (3,3,4), giving e = 5 + 2305 = 2310. For Problem 2: For p(n) = n^(d(n)/2) to be a perfect square when n divides 2310, either n=1 or d(n) must be divisible by 4. Since 2310 = 2·3·5·7·11, divisors have d(n) = 2^k where k is the number of prime factors. We need k≥2 or k=0, giving 1 + C(5,2) + C(5,3) + C(5,4) + C(5,5) = 1 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 27.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"2310\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"27\"\n        }",
