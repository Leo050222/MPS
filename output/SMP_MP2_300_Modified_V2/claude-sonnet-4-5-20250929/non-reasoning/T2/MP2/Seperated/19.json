  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nGiven: $ab = \\left(\\frac{\\text{lcm}(a,b)}{\\gcd(a,b)}\\right)^2$ where $a, b \\leq 100$ are positive integers.\n\nLet $d = \\gcd(a,b)$, so $a = dm$ and $b = dn$ where $\\gcd(m,n) = 1$.\n\nThen:\n- $\\text{lcm}(a,b) = dmn$\n- $ab = d^2mn$\n- $\\frac{\\text{lcm}(a,b)}{\\gcd(a,b)} = \\frac{dmn}{d} = mn$\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$$d^2mn = (mn)^2$$\n$$d^2mn = m^2n^2$$\n$$d^2 = mn$$\n\nSo we need $mn$ to be a perfect square with $\\gcd(m,n) = 1$.\n\nSince $\\gcd(m,n) = 1$ and $mn$ is a perfect square, both $m$ and $n$ must be perfect squares.\n\nLet $m = p^2$ and $n = q^2$ where $\\gcd(p,q) = 1$.\n\nThen $d^2 = p^2q^2$, so $d = pq$.\n\nTherefore:\n- $a = dm = pq \\cdot p^2 = p^3q$\n- $b = dn = pq \\cdot q^2 = pq^3$\n- $a + b = p^3q + pq^3 = pq(p^2 + q^2)$\n\nWe need $a, b \\leq 100$ and $\\gcd(p,q) = 1$.\n\nFrom $p^3q \\leq 100$ and $pq^3 \\leq 100$:\n\nLet me check various coprime pairs $(p,q)$:\n\n- $(p,q) = (1,4)$: $a = 1 \\cdot 4 = 4$, $b = 1 \\cdot 64 = 64$, sum = 68\n- $(p,q) = (4,1)$: $a = 64$, $b = 4$, sum = 68\n- $(p,q) = (2,3)$: $a = 8 \\cdot 3 = 24$, $b = 2 \\cdot 27 = 54$, sum = 78\n- $(p,q) = (3,2)$: $a = 27 \\cdot 2 = 54$, $b = 3 \\cdot 8 = 24$, sum = 78\n- $(p,q) = (1,3)$: $a = 1 \\cdot 3 = 3$, $b = 1 \\cdot 27 = 27$, sum = 30\n- $(p,q) = (3,1)$: $a = 27$, $b = 3$, sum = 30\n- $(p,q) = (1,2)$: $a = 2$, $b = 8$, sum = 10\n- $(p,q) = (2,1)$: $a = 8$, $b = 2$, sum = 10\n\nFor $(p,q) = (2,3)$: $p^3q = 24 \\leq 100$ ✓ and $pq^3 = 54 \\leq 100$ ✓\n\nThe maximum sum is $s = 78$.\n\nTherefore, $m = s - 77 = 78 - 77 = 1$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nWe need to color squares in a $5 \\times 5$ grid such that no four red squares form an axis-parallel rectangle.\n\nFour squares form an axis-parallel rectangle if they are at positions $(i_1, j_1), (i_1, j_2), (i_2, j_1), (i_2, j_2)$ where $i_1 \\neq i_2$ and $j_1 \\neq j_2$.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying: no two rows can have red squares in the same two columns.\n\nThis is a problem about finding the maximum number of 1's in a $5 \\times 5$ binary matrix such that no two rows have 1's in the same pair of columns.\n\nFor each row, if it has $k$ red squares, there are $\\binom{k}{2}$ pairs of columns with red squares.\n\nThe total number of distinct column pairs is $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$.\n\nIf row $i$ has $r_i$ red squares, then $\\sum_{i=1}^5 \\binom{r_i}{2} \\leq 10$.\n\nBy convexity, the sum of red squares is maximized when the $\\binom{r_i}{2}$ values are as equal as possible.\n\nIf each row contributes 2 pairs: $\\binom{r_i}{2} = 2$ means $r_i = 2$ (since $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ and $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$).\n\nActually, we can have at most 2 red squares per row to avoid conflicts, giving us $5 \\times 2 = 10$ red squares, but we need to verify this works.\n\nWith careful construction using a resolvable design, we can achieve 10 red squares.\n\nThe maximum is **10**.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Using the relationship between gcd, lcm, and the given equation, I derived that a = p³q and b = pq³ where gcd(p,q)=1. Testing coprime pairs with constraints a,b ≤ 100, the maximum sum is 78 (from p=2, q=3 giving a=24, b=54). Thus m = 78-77 = 1. For Problem 2: To avoid four red squares forming a rectangle, no two rows can share red squares in the same pair of columns. With 10 possible column pairs and proper distribution, the maximum is 10 red squares.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"10\"\n}\n```",
