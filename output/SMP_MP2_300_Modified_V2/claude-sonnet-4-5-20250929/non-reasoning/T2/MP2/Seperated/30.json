Instead of computing the probability that at least three dice show the same value among four rolls, simply find $g = \\binom{4}{3} - 3$, where $\\binom{4}{3}$ is the number of ways to choose which three dice match in the exactly three matching case derived from the event decomposition."

Let $N$ be the original number of the room, and let $M$ be the room number as shown on the sign. The smallest interval containing all possible values of $\\frac{M}{N}$ can be expressed as $\\left[\\frac{a}{b}, \\frac{c}{d}\\right)$ where $a, b, c, d$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=\\operatorname{gcd}(c, d)=1$.

  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nThe problem asks me to find $g = \\binom{4}{3} - 3$.\n\nThis is straightforward:\n- $\\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3!1!} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 3!}{3! \\cdot 1} = 4$\n- Therefore, $g = 4 - 3 = 1$\n\n## Problem 2\n\nWhen a digit 0 falls off from room number $N$, we get $M$.\n\nLet me think about what happens when a 0 is removed from a number.\n\nIf $N$ has a 0 in it, and we remove that 0, the remaining digits shift together to form $M$.\n\nFor example:\n- If $N = 102$, removing the 0 gives $M = 12$\n- If $N = 1002$, removing a 0 gives $M = 102$\n- If $N = 100$, removing a 0 gives $M = 10$\n\nLet's say $N$ can be written as $N = a \\cdot 10^{k+1} + b$ where $0 \\leq b < 10^k$ and $a \\geq 1$ (this represents the number with a 0 in position $k$ from the right).\n\nWhen we remove the 0 at position $k$, we get:\n$M = a \\cdot 10^k + b$\n\nSo the ratio is:\n$$\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{a \\cdot 10^k + b}{a \\cdot 10^{k+1} + b} = \\frac{a \\cdot 10^k + b}{10a \\cdot 10^k + b}$$\n\nLet $x = a \\cdot 10^k$ where $x \\geq 10^k$ (since $a \\geq 1$), and $0 \\leq b < 10^k$.\n\nThen:\n$$\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{x + b}{10x + b}$$\n\nTo find the range, I need to consider:\n- Minimum: As $b \\to 0$ and $x$ is large, $\\frac{x}{10x} = \\frac{1}{10}$\n- Maximum: We need to maximize $\\frac{x + b}{10x + b}$\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to $b$:\n$$\\frac{d}{db}\\left(\\frac{x + b}{10x + b}\\right) = \\frac{(10x + b) - (x + b)}{(10x + b)^2} = \\frac{9x}{(10x + b)^2} > 0$$\n\nSo the ratio increases with $b$. The maximum occurs when $b$ is as large as possible, which is $b = 10^k - 1$.\n\nWhen $b = 10^k - 1$ and $x = 10^k$ (minimum value of $x$):\n$$\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{10^k + 10^k - 1}{10 \\cdot 10^k + 10^k - 1} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 10^k - 1}{11 \\cdot 10^k - 1}$$\n\nAs $k \\to \\infty$, this approaches $\\frac{2}{11}$.\n\nFor $k = 1$: $\\frac{20 - 1}{110 - 1} = \\frac{19}{109}$\n\nLet me verify the minimum more carefully. When $b = 0$:\n$$\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{x}{10x} = \\frac{1}{10}$$\n\nThis is achieved for any $N$ of the form $a \\cdot 10^{k+1}$ (like 10, 100, 1000, etc.).\n\nFor the supremum, as $b \\to 10^k$ and $x = 10^k$:\n$$\\lim_{b \\to 10^k} \\frac{10^k + b}{10 \\cdot 10^k + b} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 10^k}{11 \\cdot 10^k} = \\frac{2}{11}$$\n\nBut $b < 10^k$, so we never actually reach $\\frac{2}{11}$.\n\nTherefore, the interval is $\\left[\\frac{1}{10}, \\frac{2}{11}\\right)$.\n\nHere $a = 1, b = 10, c = 2, d = 11$.\n\nVerification: $\\gcd(1, 10) = 1$ ✓ and $\\gcd(2, 11) = 1$ ✓\n\nThe answer is: $1000(1) + 100(10) + 10(2) + 11 = 1000 + 1000 + 20 + 11 = 2031$\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Simply compute g = C(4,3) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1. For Problem 2: When a 0 is removed from N to get M, we can write N = a·10^(k+1) + b and M = a·10^k + b. The ratio M/N = (x+b)/(10x+b) where x = a·10^k ≥ 10^k and 0 ≤ b < 10^k. The minimum is 1/10 (when b=0), and the supremum is 2/11 (as b approaches 10^k with x = 10^k), but 2/11 is never reached. So the interval is [1/10, 2/11) with a=1, b=10, c=2, d=11.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"2031\"\n        }",
