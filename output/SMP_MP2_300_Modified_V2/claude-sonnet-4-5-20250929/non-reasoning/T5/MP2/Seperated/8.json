After more careful analysis, the quadratic that works is $f(x) = x^2 + 0x + 1$, but we need to check if there's a linear term.\n\nThrough systematic checking, the solution is $f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1$ where $q = -2$.\n\nTherefore, $k = q + 10 = -2 + 10 = 8$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nGiven: $f$ is monic cubic with $f(x) + f(-x) = 0$ (odd function), so $f(x) = x^3 + ax$ for some $a$.\n\nWe need $g(y)$ (number of solutions to $f(f(x)) = y$) to take values in $\\{1, 5, 9\\}$.\n\nFor $f(x) = x^3 + ax$:\n- $f$ has critical points at $x = \\pm\\sqrt{-a/3}$ (when $a < 0$)\n- Local max at $x = -\\sqrt{-a/3}$ with value $M = 2(-a/3)^{3/2}/3$\n- Local min at $x = \\sqrt{-a/3}$ with value $-M$\n\nFor $g(y) \\in \\{1, 5, 9\\}$, we need $a < 0$ and specific conditions on the critical values.\n\nThe condition that $g$ takes exactly values $\\{1, 5, 9\\}$ means:\n- $f(M) = M$ and $f(-M) = -M$\n\nThis gives: $M^3 + aM = M$, so $M^2 = 1 - a$\n\nAlso: $M = \\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{-a}{3}} \\cdot \\sqrt{-a} = \\frac{2(-a)^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nSolving: $a = -3$, so $f(x) = x^3 - 3x$ and $f(10) = 1000 - 30 = 970$.\n\nBy symmetry and checking other cases, the only value is $970$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I tested the functional equation with a quadratic polynomial f(x) = x^2 + qx + c and found through coefficient matching that q = -2, giving k = q + 10 = 8.
