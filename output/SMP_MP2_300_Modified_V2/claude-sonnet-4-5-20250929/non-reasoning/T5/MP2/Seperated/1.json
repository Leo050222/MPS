Check:\n$$f(xf(y) + y^3) = xy + y^3$$\n$$yf(x) + f(y)^3 = yx + y^3$$\nThis works! So $f(1) = 1$.\n\nLet's verify $f(x) = -x$ doesn't work:\n$$f(xf(y) + y^3) = f(-xy + y^3) = xy - y^3$$\n$$yf(x) + f(y)^3 = -yx + (-y)^3 = -yx - y^3$$\nThis doesn't match.\n\nLet's check if $f(x) = x$ is the only solution by assuming $f$ is continuous or polynomial-like.\n\nFrom the functional equation structure and testing, $f(x) = x$ gives $f(1) = 1$.\n\n## Problem 2: Finding integers relatively prime to all $a_n$\n\nGiven: $a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1$ for $n \\geq 1$\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate first few terms\n- $a_1 = 2 + 3 + 6 - 1 = 10 = 2 \\cdot 5$\n- $a_2 = 4 + 9 + 36 - 1 = 48 = 2^4 \\cdot 3$\n- $a_3 = 8 + 27 + 216 - 1 = 250 = 2 \\cdot 5^3$\n\n**Step 2:** Find $\\gcd(a_1, a_2) = \\gcd(10, 48) = 2$\n\n**Step 3:** Check divisibility by small primes\n\nFor prime $p$ to divide all $a_n$, we need:\n$$2^n + 3^n + 6^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$$\n\nFor $p = 2$: $a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 \\equiv 0 + 1 + 0 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\nSo 2 divides all $a_n$.\n\nFor $p = 3$: $a_n \\equiv 2^n + 0 + 0 - 1 \\pmod{3}$\n- $n = 1$: $2 - 1 = 1 \\not\\equiv 0$\nSo 3 doesn't divide all $a_n$.\n\nFor $p = 5$: \n- $a_1 = 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$\n- $a_2 = 48 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$\nSo 5 doesn't divide all $a_n$.\n\n**Step 4:** Any integer relatively prime to all $a_n$ must be relatively prime to $\\gcd$ of all $a_n$.\n\nSince 2 divides all $a_n$, and checking shows no other prime divides all terms, the only positive integers relatively prime to all $a_n$ are the odd integers... but wait, we need integers that share NO common factor with ANY $a_n$.\n\nSince $\\gcd(a_1, a_2, a_3, ...) = 2$ (as 2 divides all but other primes don't), the positive integers relatively prime to all terms must be odd and not divide any specific term. Given the variety of prime factors in different $a_n$, only $\\boxed{1}$ is relatively prime to all terms.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, testing f(x)=x in the functional equation shows it satisfies the condition, giving f(1)=1. For Problem 2, computing the first few terms shows a_1=10, a_2=48, a_3=250. Since 2 divides all terms and various other primes appear in different terms, only 1 is relatively prime to all terms of the sequence.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
