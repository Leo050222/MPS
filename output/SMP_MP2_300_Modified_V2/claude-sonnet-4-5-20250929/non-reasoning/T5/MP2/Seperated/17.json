  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Find $c = f(1)$ for the functional equation $f(xy+f(x^2))=xf(x+y)$\n\nLet me denote the functional equation as $P(x,y): f(xy+f(x^2))=xf(x+y)$.\n\n**Step 1:** Find $f(0)$ by setting $x=0$ in $P(0,y)$:\n$$f(0 \\cdot y + f(0)) = 0 \\cdot f(0+y)$$\n$$f(f(0)) = 0$$\n\n**Step 2:** Set $y=0$ in $P(x,0)$:\n$$f(0 + f(x^2)) = xf(x)$$\n$$f(f(x^2)) = xf(x)$$\n\n**Step 3:** From Step 2 with $x=0$: $f(f(0)) = 0$, which confirms Step 1.\n\n**Step 4:** Let's try $x=1$ in the equation from Step 2:\n$$f(f(1)) = f(1)$$\n\nSo $f(1)$ is a fixed point of $f$.\n\n**Step 5:** Set $x=1$ in $P(1,y)$:\n$$f(y + f(1)) = f(1+y)$$\n\nThis means $f(y + f(1)) = f(1+y)$ for all $y$.\n\n**Step 6:** If $f(1) = 1$, then $f(y+1) = f(1+y)$, which is consistent.\n\nLet me verify if $f(x) = x$ works:\n- LHS: $f(xy + f(x^2)) = f(xy + x^2) = xy + x^2$\n- RHS: $xf(x+y) = x(x+y) = x^2 + xy$\n- These are equal! ✓\n\n**Step 7:** Let me check if there are other solutions. From $f(f(x^2)) = xf(x)$, if $f(x) = cx$ for some constant $c$:\n- $f(f(x^2)) = f(cx^2) = c^2x^2$\n- $xf(x) = x \\cdot cx = cx^2$\n- So $c^2x^2 = cx^2$, giving $c^2 = c$, thus $c = 0$ or $c = 1$.\n\nIf $c=0$, then $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$. Checking: $f(xy + f(x^2)) = 0$ and $xf(x+y) = 0$. ✓\n\nIf $c=1$, then $f(x) = x$, which we already verified.\n\nFor the non-trivial solution $f(x) = x$, we have $f(1) = 1$.\n\n## Problem 2: Find all positive integers relatively prime to all terms of $a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1$\n\n**Step 1:** Compute the first few terms:\n- $a_1 = 2 + 3 + 6 - 1 = 10 = 2 \\cdot 5$\n- $a_2 = 4 + 9 + 36 - 1 = 48 = 2^4 \\cdot 3$\n- $a_3 = 8 + 27 + 216 - 1 = 250 = 2 \\cdot 5^3$\n- $a_4 = 16 + 81 + 1296 - 1 = 1392 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 29$\n\n**Step 2:** Find $\\gcd(a_1, a_2) = \\gcd(10, 48) = 2$.\n\n**Step 3:** Check divisibility by small primes:\n- For $p=2$: $a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 \\equiv 0 + 1 + 0 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. So $2 | a_n$ for all $n$.\n- For $p=3$: $a_n \\equiv 2^n + 0 + 0 - 1 \\pmod{3}$. For $n=2$: $4 - 1 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. So $3 | a_2$.\n- For $p=5$: $a_n \\equiv 2^n + 3^n + 1^n - 1 \\equiv 2^n + 3^n \\pmod{5}$. For $n=1$: $2 + 3 = 5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. So $5 | a_1$.\n\n**Step 4:** Since $2 | a_n$ for all $n$, any integer relatively prime to all $a_n$ must be odd.\n\nSince $3 | a_2$ and $5 | a_1$, any such integer cannot be divisible by 3 or 5.\n\n**Step 5:** The only positive integer that divides no term is 1, since every prime $p$ will divide some $a_n$ (as the sequence grows and covers various residues).\n\nTherefore, the only positive integer relatively prime to all terms is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, I found that f(x)=x is a solution by testing the functional equation, giving f(1)=1. For Problem 2, I computed that 2 divides all terms, 3 divides a_2, and 5 divides a_1, so only 1 is relatively prime to all terms.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}\n```",
