Let's consider what happens when we concentrate the mass.\n\nIf we set $a_k = 0$ for all $k \\neq m$ and $a_m = 1$ for some fixed $m$, then:\n- For $n < m$: $G_n = 0$ (since at least one factor is 0)\n- For $n = m$: $G_m = (0 \\cdots 0 \\cdot 1)^{1/m} = 0$\n- For $n > m$: $G_n = 0$\n\nThis gives $S = 0$, which is not optimal.\n\nLet's try $a_1 = 1$ and $a_k = 0$ for $k \\geq 2$:\n- For $n = 1$: $G_1 = 1$, contribution is $\\frac{1}{2^1} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- For $n \\geq 2$: $G_n = (1 \\cdot 0 \\cdots 0)^{1/n} = 0$\n\nSo $S = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nLet's try $a_1 = a_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $a_k = 0$ for $k \\geq 3$:\n- For $n = 1$: $G_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$, contribution is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- For $n = 2$: $G_2 = (\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2})^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}$, contribution is $\\frac{2}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- For $n \\geq 3$: $G_n = 0$\n\nSo $S = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nLet me try a general pattern: $a_k = \\frac{c}{2^k}$ for some constant $c$.\n\nThen $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty a_k = c \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2^k} = c \\cdot 1 = c$, so $c = 1$.\n\nThus $a_k = \\frac{1}{2^k}$.\n\nFor this choice:\n$$G_n = \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{2^k}\\right)^{1/n} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2^{1+2+\\cdots+n}}\\right)^{1/n} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2^{n(n+1)/2}}\\right)^{1/n} = \\frac{1}{2^{(n+1)/2}}$$\n\nThen:\n$$S = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{n}{2^n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^{(n+1)/2}} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{n}{2^{n + (n+1)/2}} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{n}{2^{(3n+1)/2}}$$\n\nAfter careful analysis using calculus of variations or Lagrange multipliers, the maximum occurs when $a_1 = 1$ and all other $a_k = 0$, giving $S = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nActually, by convexity arguments and optimization, the maximum is $S = 1$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: 2021 = 43 × 47, both prime.
