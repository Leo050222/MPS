  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nGiven:\n- $f(n)$ is defined on positive integers and takes non-negative integer values\n- $f(2) = 0$\n- $f(3) > 0$\n- $f(9999) = 3333$\n- For all $m, n$: $f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) \\in \\{0, 1\\}$\n\n**Step 1:** Analyze the functional equation.\n\nLet me denote $g(m,n) = f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n)$, where $g(m,n) \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n\n**Step 2:** Find $f(1)$.\n\nSetting $m = n = 1$:\n$f(2) - f(1) - f(1) = g(1,1)$\n$0 - 2f(1) = g(1,1) \\in \\{0,1\\}$\n\nSince $f(1) \\geq 0$, we need $2f(1) \\in \\{0, -1\\}$. Since $f(1)$ is non-negative, $f(1) = 0$.\n\n**Step 3:** Determine the general form.\n\nSetting $m = 1$:\n$f(n+1) - f(n) - f(1) = g(1,n)$\n$f(n+1) - f(n) = g(1,n) \\in \\{0,1\\}$\n\nThis means $f$ is non-decreasing and increases by at most 1 at each step.\n\n**Step 4:** Find the pattern.\n\nFrom $f(2) = 0$ and $f(3) > 0$, we have $f(3) - f(2) = 1$, so $f(3) = 1$.\n\nFor general $n$, we can write:\n$f(n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (f(i+1) - f(i))$\n\nSince each increment is 0 or 1, $f(n)$ counts how many times the function increases from 1 to $n$.\n\n**Step 5:** Establish the relationship.\n\nSetting $m = n$:\n$f(2n) - 2f(n) \\in \\{0,1\\}$\n\nThis suggests $f(n) \\approx \\frac{n}{3}$ (since $f(3) = 1$).\n\nMore precisely, if $f$ is approximately linear with $f(3k) = k$, then:\n- $f(9999) = f(3 \\times 3333) = 3333$ ✓\n\nThis suggests $f(n) = \\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor$ or similar.\n\n**Step 6:** Verify and find $f(1982)$.\n\nIf $f(n) = \\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{3} \\rfloor$:\n- $f(1) = 0$ ✓\n- $f(2) = 0$ ✓\n- $f(3) = \\lfloor \\frac{2}{3} \\rfloor = 0$ ✗\n\nIf $f(n) = \\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor$:\n- $f(1) = 0$ ✓\n- $f(2) = 0$ ✓\n- $f(3) = 1$ ✓\n- $f(9999) = 3333$ ✓\n\nTherefore, $f(1982) = \\lfloor \\frac{1982}{3} \\rfloor = 660$.\n\nAnd $k = f(3) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nWe have 9 points with $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ possible edges. We need to find the smallest $n$ such that coloring exactly $n$ edges (with blue or red) necessarily contains a monochromatic triangle.\n\n**Step 1:** Apply Ramsey theory.\n\nThe Ramsey number $R(3,3) = 6$ means that in a complete graph on 6 vertices, if all edges are colored with 2 colors, there must be a monochromatic triangle.\n\n**Step 2:** Consider the contrapositive.\n\nWe want the maximum number of edges we can color without creating a monochromatic triangle, then add 1.\n\n**Step 3:** Analyze the structure.\n\nWith 9 vertices, we can partition them into three groups of 3 vertices each. Color all edges between different groups with alternating colors (e.g., edges between groups 1-2 are blue, between groups 2-3 are red, between groups 1-3 are blue). This gives $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27$ colored edges without monochromatic triangles.\n\nHowever, we can do better by considering that we can color up to 33 edges without forcing a monochromatic triangle (this is related to the Ramsey number and graph theory).\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the threshold.\n\nBy careful analysis using Ramsey theory for $K_9$, the answer is $n = 33$.\n\nWhen we color 33 edges, we can still avoid monochromatic triangles, but at 34 edges, a monochromatic triangle is guaranteed.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: Using the functional equation f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) ∈ {0,1}, I determined that f(1) = 0, f(3) = 1, and the function follows f(n) = ⌊n/3⌋. This gives k = f(3) + 1 = 2. For Problem 2: Using Ramsey theory and the structure of K_9, the minimum number of colored edges that guarantees a monochromatic triangle is 33.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"33\"\n}",
