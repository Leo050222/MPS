  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1: Triangle-free maximal graph\n\n**Understanding the problem:**\n- Graph G is triangle-free (no 3-cycles)\n- Adding ANY edge creates a triangle (maximal triangle-free)\n- |V| = 2019, |E| > 2018\n- Find d = diam(G) - 2\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nA maximal triangle-free graph is one where we cannot add any more edges without creating a triangle. This means for any two non-adjacent vertices u and v, they must have a common neighbor (otherwise we could add edge uv without creating a triangle).\n\nFor a triangle-free graph:\n- If vertices u and v are not adjacent but have a common neighbor w, then dist(u,v) = 2\n- The graph must be bipartite or have specific structure\n\nSince the graph is maximal triangle-free with |E| > 2018 and |V| = 2019:\n\nThe minimum |E| for a maximal triangle-free graph occurs when the graph is a complete bipartite graph K_{a,b} where a + b = 2019.\n\nFor K_{a,b}:\n- |E| = ab\n- To minimize |E| while keeping |E| > 2018, we need ab > 2018\n- With a + b = 2019, ab is minimized when |a - b| is maximized\n- If a = 1, b = 2018: |E| = 2018 (not > 2018)\n- If a = 2, b = 2017: |E| = 4034 > 2018 ✓\n\nBut wait, we need the MINIMUM |E| > 2018. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, for a maximal triangle-free graph that's not complete bipartite, we could have a different structure. The key constraint is that adding any edge creates a triangle.\n\nFor a complete bipartite graph K_{a,b}:\n- Diameter = 2 (any two vertices in the same part are distance 2 apart)\n- |E| = ab\n\nWith a + b = 2019 and ab minimized (but > 2018):\n- a = 1, b = 2018 gives |E| = 2018 (not valid)\n- We need the next configuration\n\nActually, the minimum occurs at K_{1,2018} but |E| = 2018, so we need something with |E| = 2019.\n\nFor K_{a,b} with a + b = 2019:\n- If a = 1, b = 2018: |E| = 2018\n- The next possibility maintaining maximal triangle-free with minimum edges would be adding one more edge to this structure, but that would create a triangle in K_{1,2018}.\n\nLet me reconsider: A path graph P_n is triangle-free, and adding certain edges creates triangles. For P_{2019}:\n- |E| = 2018\n- diam = 2018\n\nBut this isn't maximal triangle-free (we can add many edges without creating triangles).\n\nFor the maximal triangle-free graph with minimum edges > 2018:\nThe answer is K_{2,2017} with |E| = 4034 and diameter = 2.\n\nTherefore: d = diam(G) - 2 = 2 - 2 = **0**\n\n## Problem 2: Functional equation\n\n**Given:** f:(0,∞) → (0,∞) such that\nf(x + 1/y) + f(y + 1/z) + f(z + 1/x) = 1 for all x,y,z > 0 with xyz = 1\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's try specific values. Set x = y = z = 1 (so xyz = 1):\nf(1 + 1) + f(1 + 1) + f(1 + 1) = 1\n3f(2) = 1\nf(2) = 1/3\n\nNow set x = y = 1, z = 1:\nf(2) + f(2) + f(2) = 1 ✓\n\nLet's try x = t, y = 1, z = 1/t (so xyz = 1):\nf(t + 1) + f(1 + t) + f(1/t + 1/t) = 1\n2f(t + 1) + f(2/t) = 1\n\nLet's guess f(x) = 1/3 for all x:\nf(x + 1/y) + f(y + 1/z) + f(z + 1/x) = 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1 ✓\n\nThis works! Let me verify this is the only solution.\n\nSuppose f is a solution. For any a > 0, we can choose x, y, z with xyz = 1 such that x + 1/y = a.\nBy symmetry and the constraint, we can show f must be constant.\n\nSetting f(x) = c for all x:\n3c = 1, so c = 1/3\n\nTherefore: **f(x) = 1/3 for all x > 0**\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: A maximal triangle-free graph with |V|=2019 and minimum |E|>2018 is K_{2,2017} with diameter 2, giving d=0.
