  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve both problems step by step.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nWe need to find $m = d + 98$, where $d = x_1 = \\binom{2 \\cdot 1}{1} = \\binom{2}{1} = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $m = 2 + 98 = 100$.\n\nLet me verify this makes sense in the context. We have $x_n = \\binom{2n}{n}$, so:\n- $x_1 = \\binom{2}{1} = 2$\n- $x_2 = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$\n- $x_3 = \\binom{6}{3} = 20$\n\nThe problem asks about finding sets $A, B$ such that $\\frac{\\prod_{i \\in A} x_i}{\\prod_{j \\in B} x_j} = 2012$.\n\nNote that $2012 = 4 \\times 503$. We can use the identity:\n$$\\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n} = \\frac{\\binom{2n+2}{n+1}}{\\binom{2n}{n}} = \\frac{(2n+2)(2n+1)}{(n+1)^2}$$\n\nBut the problem simplifies to just finding $d + 98$ where $d = x_1 = 2$.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of pairs $(i,j)$ with $1 \\le i < j \\le 100$ such that $|a_i b_j - a_j b_i| = 1$.\n\nThe condition $|a_i b_j - a_j b_i| = 1$ means that the vectors $(a_i, b_i)$ and $(a_j, b_j)$ form a parallelogram with area 1 (they are adjacent in the Farey sequence sense).\n\nKey insight: If we think of these as lattice points, two points $(a_i, b_i)$ and $(a_j, b_j)$ satisfy $|a_i b_j - a_j b_i| = 1$ if and only if they are consecutive in some Farey sequence or form a unimodular pair.\n\nThe maximum occurs when we arrange the 100 ordered pairs as consecutive terms in the Stern-Brocot tree or Farey sequence. In such an arrangement, we can form a path where consecutive pairs satisfy the condition.\n\nFor a path of length $n$, we get $n-1$ pairs. But we can do better by creating a tree structure.\n\nThe optimal configuration is the Stern-Brocot tree structure. Starting with $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$, we can build a binary tree where each parent-child relationship satisfies $|a_i b_j - a_j b_i| = 1$.\n\nIn a complete binary tree with 100 nodes:\n- We have 99 edges (parent-child relationships)\n- Each edge contributes one pair satisfying the condition\n\nHowever, we can also have pairs that are not directly connected but still satisfy the condition. The maximum is achieved when we take the first 100 terms of the Stern-Brocot sequence.\n\nFor 100 points arranged optimally in the Stern-Brocot tree:\n- A binary tree with 100 nodes has 99 edges\n- Additional pairs come from \"uncle-nephew\" relationships and other configurations\n\nThe maximum value is $N = 197$.\n\nThis can be achieved by taking 100 consecutive Farey neighbors, which forms a path-like structure where:\n- We get 99 consecutive pairs\n- We get 98 pairs skipping one element\n- And so on...\n\nActually, the maximum is $N = 197$ which equals $2 \\times 100 - 3 = 197$.\n\n{\n            \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1: We need d = x_1 = C(2,1) = 2, so m = d + 98 = 2 + 98 = 100. For Problem 2: The condition |a_i*b_j - a_j*b_i| = 1 means the pairs form unimodular relationships. The maximum occurs with an optimal arrangement in the Stern-Brocot tree structure. For 100 points, this gives N = 197 pairs.\",\n            \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n            \"answer_2\": \"197\"\n        }",
