Thus k = f(1) - 2 = 0. Then, for the second part with k = 0, I needed to find α such that for every continuous function f:[0,1] → ℝ differentiable on (0,1) with f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1, there exists ξ ∈ (0,1) where f'(ξ) - f(ξ) = α. Using g(x) = e^(-x)f(x) and the Mean Value Theorem, g(1) - g(0) = e^(-1), which equals g'(ξ) = e^(-ξ)(f'(ξ) - f(ξ)) = αe^(-ξ) for some ξ. This gives α = e^(-1) = 1/e.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/e\"\n}",
