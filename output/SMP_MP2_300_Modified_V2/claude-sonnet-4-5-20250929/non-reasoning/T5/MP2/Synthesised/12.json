Let $p(x)$ be the polynomial of degree $1008$ such that $p(2n+1) = F_{2n+1}$ for $n=0,1,2,\\dots,1008$. Find integers $j$ and $k$ such that $p(2019) = F_j - F_k$.

  "reasoning_content": "I'll solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the problem structure**\n\nFirst, let me identify what we need:\n- We have a polynomial $p(x)$ of degree 1008 that interpolates odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers\n- We need to find $d = N - 1008$ where $N$ is the degree of the polynomial\n- But wait, the problem states $p(x)$ has degree 1008, so $N = 1008$, thus $d = 1008 - 1008 = 0$\n\nActually, re-reading the problem, it seems there's a confusion in the problem statement. Let me reconsider: the problem asks to \"find $d = N - 1008$, where $N$ is the degree of the polynomial.\" Since the polynomial is explicitly stated to have degree 1008, we have $d = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Setting up the differential system**\n\nWe need to find the smallest $r > d = 0$ such that there exist differentiable functions $f$ and $g$ satisfying:\n- (a) $f(0) > 0$\n- (b) $g(0) = 0$\n- (c) $|f'(x)| \\leq |g(x)|$ for all $x$\n- (d) $|g'(x)| \\leq |f(x)|$ for all $x$\n- (e) $f(r) = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the differential inequalities**\n\nFrom conditions (c) and (d):\n- $|f'(x)| \\leq |g(x)|$\n- $|g'(x)| \\leq |f(x)|$\n\nLet's consider the case where $f$ and $g$ are positive near $x = 0$ (since $f(0) > 0$ and $g(0) = 0$).\n\nDifferentiating and using the inequalities:\n- $(f^2)' = 2ff' \\leq 2f|g| = 2|f||g|$\n- $(g^2)' = 2gg' \\leq 2g|f| = 2|g||f|$\n\nConsider $h(x) = f(x)^2 - g(x)^2$. Then:\n$h'(x) = 2f(x)f'(x) - 2g(x)g'(x)$\n\n**Step 4: Finding the optimal solution**\n\nThe system suggests trying hyperbolic functions. Let's try:\n- $f(x) = A\\cosh(x) + B\\sinh(x)$\n- $g(x) = A\\sinh(x) + B\\cosh(x)$\n\nThen:\n- $f'(x) = A\\sinh(x) + B\\cosh(x) = g(x)$ ✓\n- $g'(x) = A\\cosh(x) + B\\sinh(x) = f(x)$ ✓\n\nThis satisfies conditions (c) and (d) with equality!\n\nFrom condition (b): $g(0) = A\\sinh(0) + B\\cosh(0) = B = 0$\n\nSo $f(x) = A\\cosh(x)$ and $g(x) = A\\sinh(x)$.\n\nFrom condition (a): $f(0) = A\\cosh(0) = A > 0$, so $A > 0$.\n\nFrom condition (e): $f(r) = A\\cosh(r) = 0$\n\nBut $\\cosh(r) > 0$ for all real $r$, so this doesn't work directly.\n\n**Step 5: Reconsidering the solution**\n\nWe need $f(r) = 0$ where $f(0) > 0$. This means $f$ must decrease from a positive value to 0.\n\nLet's try: $f(x) = \\cos(x)$ and $g(x) = \\sin(x)$\n\nThen:\n- $f'(x) = -\\sin(x)$, so $|f'(x)| = |\\sin(x)| = |g(x)|$ ✓\n- $g'(x) = \\cos(x)$, so $|g'(x)| = |\\cos(x)| = |f(x)|$ ✓\n- $f(0) = 1 > 0$ ✓\n- $g(0) = 0$ ✓\n- $f(r) = 0$ when $r = \\pi/2$ ✓\n\nThe smallest $r > 0$ where $\\cos(r) = 0$ is $r = \\pi/2$.\n\n{  \n            \"reasoning\": \"The problem reduces to finding the smallest r > 0 where a system of differential inequalities is satisfied. By trying f(x) = cos(x) and g(x) = sin(x), all conditions are met: f(0) = 1 > 0, g(0) = 0, |f'(x)| = |sin(x)| = |g(x)|, |g'(x)| = |cos(x)| = |f(x)|, and f(r) = 0 when r = π/2.\",\n            \"answer\": \"pi/2\"\n        }",
