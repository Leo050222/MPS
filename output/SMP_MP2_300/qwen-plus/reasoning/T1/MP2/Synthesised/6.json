  "math_problem": "The surface area of a cube is 24. What is the volume of the cube? Instead of determining the volume of the cube, simply find $a$, where $a$ is the length of an edge of the cube. One integer is selected at random from the following list of 15 integers: $1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5$. The probability that the selected integer is equal to $n$ is $a - \\frac{5}{3}$. What is the value of $n$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The surface area of a cube is given by $6a^2 = 24$. Solving for $a$, we get $a^2 = 4$, so $a = 2$. The probability that the selected integer equals $n$ is $a - \\\\frac{5}{3} = 2 - \\\\frac{5}{3} = \\\\frac{1}{3}$. The total number of integers is 15, so the count of $n$ must satisfy $\\\\frac{\\\\text{count}(n)}{15} = \\\\frac{1}{3}$, giving $\\\\text{count}(n) = 5$. In the list, the integer 5 appears 5 times. Thus, $n = 5$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
