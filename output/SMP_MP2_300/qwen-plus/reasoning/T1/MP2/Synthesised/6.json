  "math_problem": "The surface area of a cube is 24. What is the volume of the cube? Instead of determining the volume of the cube, simply find $a$, where $a$ is the length of an edge of the cube. One integer is selected at random from the following list of 15 integers: $1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5$. The probability that the selected integer is equal to $n$ is $a - \\frac{5}{3}$. What is the value of $n$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The surface area of a cube is given by $6a^2 = 24$. Solving for $a$, we get $a^2 = 4$, so $a = 2$. The probability that a randomly selected integer equals $n$ is $a - \\\\frac{5}{3} = 2 - \\\\frac{5}{3} = \\\\frac{1}{3}$. In the list of 15 integers, the count of each number is: 1 (1 time), 2 (2 times), 3 (3 times), 4 (4 times), 5 (5 times). The probability for $n=5$ is $\\\\frac{5}{15} = \\\\frac{1}{3}$, which matches the given probability. Thus, $n = 5$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
