  "math_problem": "If $x$ and $y$ are positive integers with $x+y=31$, what is the largest possible value of $x y$? Instead of finding the largest possible value of the product $x y$, simply find $k$, which is that largest value minus 231. If a line segment joins the points $(-k,-2)$ and $(6,8)$, how many points on the line segment have coordinates that are both integers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, first maximize $xy$ given $x + y = 31$ with $x, y$ positive integers. The product $xy$ is maximized when $x$ and $y$ are as close as possible. Since $31$ is odd, the closest integers are $15$ and $16$, giving $xy = 15 \\\\times 16 = 240$. Then $k = 240 - 231 = 9$. Next, find the number of integer-coordinate points on the line segment joining $(-9, -2)$ and $(6, 8)$. Compute the differences: $\\\\Delta x = 6 - (-9) = 15$, $\\\\Delta y = 8 - (-2) = 10$. The GCD of $15$ and $10$ is $5$. The number of lattice points is $\\\\text{GCD}(15, 10) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
