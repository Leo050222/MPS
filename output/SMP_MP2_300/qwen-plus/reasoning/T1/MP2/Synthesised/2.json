  "math_problem": "Let $s(n)$ denote the number of 1's in the binary representation of $n$. Compute $$\\frac{1}{255} \\sum_{0 \\leq n<16} 2^{n}(-1)^{s(n)}$$ Instead of evaluating the provided expression, simply find $k = T + 46$, where $T = \\sum_{n=0}^{7} 2^{n} (-1)^{s(n)}$ is the alternating sum over the subrange of length 8. You plan to open your own Tmall.com store, called 'Store B,' selling the same headphones and speaker set at the same list prices as Store A does. Your store sells only these two models. You plan to issue 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupons, limited to one per order, where x is an integer greater than 0 and smaller than 99. (For example, the discount for an order of 250 RMB is x RMB, not 2x RMB). The Tmall.com '60 RMB off 299 RMB' coupon can be applied to purchases at store B and can be stacked with your 'x RMB off 99 RMB' coupon. What is the minimal number x such that $k \\leq x < 99$ and Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less on either the 250 RMB pair of the headphones or the 600 RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A? What is the minimal number x such that $k \\leq x < 99$ and Xiao Ming can spend at least 1 RMB less for buying both the 250 RMB pair of the headphones and the 600 RMB speakers set in your Store B than in Store A?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute T = sum_{n=0}^7 2^n (-1)^{s(n)}, where s(n) is the number of 1's in the binary representation of n. For n from 0 to 7:\\n- n=0 (000): s=0, term=1*1=1\\n- n=1 (001): s=1, term=2*(-1)=-2\\n- n=2 (010): s=1, term=4*(-1)=-4\\n- n=3 (011): s=2, term=8*1=8\\n- n=4 (100): s=1, term=16*(-1)=-16\\n- n=5 (101): s=2, term=32*1=32\\n- n=6 (110): s=2, term=64*1=64\\n- n=7 (111): s=3, term=128*(-1)=-128\\nSumming these: 1 - 2 - 4 + 8 - 16 + 32 + 64 - 128 = -45. Thus, T = -45. Then k = T + 46 = 1.\\n\\nFor the coupon problem, Store B offers 'x RMB off 99 RMB' (one per order) and stacks with Tmall's '60 RMB off 299 RMB' coupon. \\n- **Headphones (250 RMB)**: Store B price = 250 - x (Tmall coupon doesn't apply as 250 < 299). To save ≥1 RMB: 250 - x ≤ 249 ⇒ x ≥ 1.\\n- **Speakers (600 RMB)**: Store B price = 600 - x - 60 = 540 - x. Saving is always ≥61 (for x ≥ 1), so any x ≥ 1 works.\\n- **Combined (850 RMB)**: Store B price = 850 - x - 60 = 790 - x. Saving is x + 60 ≥ 61 (for x ≥ 1), so any x ≥ 1 works.\\n\\nSince k = 1, the minimal x satisfying k ≤ x < 99 for both scenarios is 1.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
