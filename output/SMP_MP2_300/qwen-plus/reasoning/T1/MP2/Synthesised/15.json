  "math_problem": "The price of each item at the Gauss Gadget Store has been reduced by $20 \\%$ from its original price. An MP3 player has a sale price of $\\\\$ 112$. What would the same MP3 player sell for if it was on sale for $30 \\%$ off of its original price? Instead of computing the sale price under the alternative discount percentage, simply find $k = R - 128$, where $R$ is the original price of the MP3 player determined from the given sale price after the initial discount. For some integers $m$ and $n$, the expression $(x+m)(x+n)$ is equal to a quadratic expression in $x$ with a constant term of $-k$. Which of the following cannot be a value of $m$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The original price R is found by recognizing that a 20% discount leaves 80% of R equal to $112. Solving 0.8R = 112 gives R = 140. Then k = R - 128 = 140 - 128 = 12. The constant term of (x + m)(x + n) is mn = -k = -12. The integer pairs (m, n) satisfying mn = -12 are (±1, ∓12), (±2, ∓6), (±3, ∓4), (±4, ∓3), (±6, ∓2), (±12, ∓1). Thus, possible m values are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±12. Any integer not in this set cannot be m. Since 5 is not a divisor of -12, it cannot be a value of m.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
