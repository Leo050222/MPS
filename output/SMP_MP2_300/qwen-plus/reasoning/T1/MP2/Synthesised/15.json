  "math_problem": "The price of each item at the Gauss Gadget Store has been reduced by $20 \\%$ from its original price. An MP3 player has a sale price of $\\\\$ 112$. What would the same MP3 player sell for if it was on sale for $30 \\%$ off of its original price? Instead of computing the sale price under the alternative discount percentage, simply find $k = R - 128$, where $R$ is the original price of the MP3 player determined from the given sale price after the initial discount. For some integers $m$ and $n$, the expression $(x+m)(x+n)$ is equal to a quadratic expression in $x$ with a constant term of $-k$. Which of the following cannot be a value of $m$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The sale price of $112 represents 80% of the original price $ R $. Solving $ 0.8R = 112 $ gives $ R = \\\\frac{112}{0.8} = 140 $. Then $ k = R - 128 = 140 - 128 = 12 $. The quadratic expression $ (x + m)(x + n) $ has a constant term $ mn = -k = -12 $. The integer pairs $ (m, n) $ satisfying $ mn = -12 $ are $ (\\\\pm1, \\\\mp12), (\\\\pm2, \\\\mp6), (\\\\pm3, \\\\mp4), (\\\\pm4, \\\\mp3), (\\\\pm6, \\\\mp2), (\\\\pm12, \\\\mp1) $. Thus, possible values of $ m $ are $ \\\\pm1, \\\\pm2, \\\\pm3, \\\\pm4, \\\\pm6, \\\\pm12 $. Any integer not in this set cannot be $ m $. Among typical options, 5 is not a divisor of -12 and thus cannot be a value of $ m $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
