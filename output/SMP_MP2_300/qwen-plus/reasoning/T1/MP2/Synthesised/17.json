Instead of determining the numerical value of the given algebraic expression, simply find \\( k = v - 1 \\), where \\( v \\) is the quantity defined in terms of \\( x \\) as stated. The line with equation $y = 3x + k$ is translated 2 units to the right. What is the equation of the resulting line?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Given x = 2, v = 3x = 6. Then k = v - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5. The original line is y = 3x + 5. Translating 2 units to the right replaces x with (x - 2), resulting in y = 3(x - 2) + 5. Simplifying gives y = 3x - 6 + 5 = 3x - 1.\",\n    \"answer\": \"y = 3x - 1\"\n}",
