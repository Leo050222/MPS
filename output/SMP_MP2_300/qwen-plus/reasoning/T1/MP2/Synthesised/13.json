  "math_problem": "Two different numbers are randomly selected from the set $\\{-3, -1, 0, 2, 4\\}$ and then multiplied together. What is the probability that the product of the two numbers chosen is 0? Instead of determining the probability that the product of the two selected numbers is zero, simply find $k = |S| + 2016$, where $|S|$ is the number of elements in the given set. Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers for which $45a + b = k$. What is the minimum possible value of $a + b$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given set is {-3, -1, 0, 2, 4}, which has 5 elements. Thus, |S| = 5. Calculating k = |S| + 2016 gives k = 5 + 2016 = 2021. We need positive integers a and b such that 45a + b = 2021 and minimize a + b. Expressing b as b = 2021 - 45a, the sum a + b becomes 2021 - 44a. To minimize this sum, a must be maximized while keeping b positive. The largest integer a satisfying 45a < 2021 is a = 44 (since 45*44 = 1980 and 45*45 = 2025 > 2021). For a = 44, b = 2021 - 1980 = 41. Thus, a + b = 44 + 41 = 85, which is the minimum possible value.\",\n    \"answer\": \"85\"\n}",
