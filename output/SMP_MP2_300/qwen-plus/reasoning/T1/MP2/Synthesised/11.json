  "math_problem": "Consider positive integers $a \\leq b \\leq c \\leq d \\leq e$. There are $N$ lists $a, b, c, d, e$ with a mean of 2023 and a median of 2023, in which the integer 2023 appears more than once, and in which no other integer appears more than once. What is the sum of the digits of $N$? Instead of computing the sum of the digits of the total number of such ordered quintuples, simply find $N$, the total number of such ordered quintuples. In Rad's garden there are exactly 30 red roses, exactly 19 yellow roses, and no other roses. How many of the yellow roses does Rad need to remove so that $\\left(N - \\frac{21464546}{7}\\right)$ of the roses in the garden are yellow?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine the number $ N $ of valid ordered quintuples $ (a, b, c, d, e) $ satisfying the given conditions:\\n\\n- $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c \\\\leq d \\\\leq e $ are positive integers.\\n- The mean is 2023, so $ a + b + c + d + e = 10115 $.\\n- The median is 2023, so $ c = 2023 $.\\n- The integer 2023 appears **more than once**.\\n- No other integer appears more than once.\\n\\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the quintuple\\n\\nSince $ c = 2023 $, the sum becomes:\\n$$\\na + b + d + e = 8092\\n$$\\n\\nWe consider how many times 2023 appears in the list. Let $ k $ be the number of elements less than 2023 and $ m $ be the number of elements greater than 2023. Then the number of 2023s is $ 5 - k - m $. We require $ 5 - k - m \\\\geq 2 $, i.e., $ k + m \\\\leq 3 $.\\n\\nAlso, since no other integer can repeat, all values less than 2023 must be distinct and strictly increasing, and all values greater than 2023 must also be distinct and strictly increasing.\\n\\n### Step 2: Count valid configurations\\n\\n#### Case 1: All five elements are 2023\\n- This gives one configuration: $ (2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023) $.\\n- Valid because 2023 appears more than once and there are no other integers to violate the uniqueness condition.\\n- Count = **1**.\\n\\n#### Case 2: Exactly three 2023s\\n- Occurs when $ a < 2023 $, $ b = c = d = 2023 $, and $ e > 2023 $.\\n- From the sum: $ a + e = 4046 $, with $ a < 2023 $ and $ e > 2023 $.\\n- $ a $ ranges from 1 to 2022, giving **2022** valid configurations.\\n\\n#### Case 3: Exactly two 2023s\\nThis occurs in two subcases:\\n\\n- **Subcase A**: $ a < 2023 $, $ b = c = 2023 $, $ d < e > 2023 $\\n  - Sum: $ a + d + e = 6069 $\\n  - For each $ a $ from 1 to 2020, count the number of pairs $ (d, e) $ such that $ d < e $, $ d > 2023 $, and $ d + e = 6069 - a $.\\n  - Total = **1,021,110**.\\n\\n- **Subcase B**: $ a < b < 2023 $, $ c = d = 2023 $, $ e > 2023 $\\n  - Sum: $ a + b + e = 6069 $\\n  - Number of distinct pairs $ (a, b) $ with $ a < b < 2023 $ is $ \\\\binom{2022}{2} = 2,043,231 $.\\n\\nTotal for this case = **1,021,110 + 2,043,231 = 3,064,341**.\\n\\n### Step 3: Total number of valid quintuples\\n\\nAdding all cases:\\n$$\\nN = 1 + 2022 + 3,064,341 = 3,066,364\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 4: Solve Rad's garden problem\\n\\nGiven:\\n- 30 red roses\\n- 19 yellow roses\\n- Total = 49 roses\\n\\nLet $ x $ be the number of yellow roses to remove. After removal:\\n- Yellow roses = $ 19 - x $\\n- Total roses = $ 49 - x $\\n\\nWe are told that:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{19 - x}{49 - x} = N - \\\\frac{21464546}{7}\\n$$\\n\\nCompute:\\n$$\\nN - \\\\frac{21464546}{7} = 3,066,364 - \\\\frac{21464546}{7} = \\\\frac{2}{7}\\n$$\\n\\nSo:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{19 - x}{49 - x} = \\\\frac{2}{7}\\n$$\\n\\nSolving:\\n$$\\n7(19 - x) = 2(49 - x) \\\\Rightarrow 133 - 7x = 98 - 2x \\\\Rightarrow 35 = 5x \\\\Rightarrow x = 7\\n$$\",\n    \"answer\": \"7\"\n}",
