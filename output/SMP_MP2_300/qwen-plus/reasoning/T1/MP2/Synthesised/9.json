  "math_problem": "What is the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region if a circular spinner is divided into six regions, four regions each have a central angle of $x^{\\circ}$, and the remaining regions have central angles of $20^{\\circ}$ and $140^{\\circ}$, where the shaded regions consist of the $140^{\\circ}$ region and two of the $x^{\\circ}$ regions? Instead of computing the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region, simply find $N = \\theta + 2700$, where $\\theta$ is the total central angle in degrees of the shaded regions. We call the pair $(m, n)$ of positive integers a happy pair if the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is a perfect square. For example, $(20, 24)$ is a happy pair because the greatest common divisor of 20 and 24 is 4. Suppose that $k$ is a positive integer such that $(205800, 35k)$ is a happy pair. What is the number of possible values of $k$ with $k \\leq N$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the total central angle of the shaded regions. The spinner has six regions: four with angle $x^\\\\circ$, one with $20^\\\\circ$, and one with $140^\\\\circ$. The sum of central angles in a circle is $360^\\\\circ$, so:\\n$$\\n4x + 20 + 140 = 360 \\\\implies 4x = 200 \\\\implies x = 50.\\n$$\\nThe shaded regions consist of the $140^\\\\circ$ region and two $x^\\\\circ$ regions, so the total shaded angle $\\\\theta$ is:\\n$$\\n\\\\theta = 140 + 2 \\\\times 50 = 240.\\n$$\\nThus, $N = \\\\theta + 2700 = 240 + 2700 = 2940$.\\n\\nNext, analyze the happy pair condition for $(205800, 35k)$.
