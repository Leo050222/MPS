  "math_problem": "Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. Friday, at which point it had been on for exactly 100 hours. At what time had Kamile turned her computer on? Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day. Three different numbers from the list $2, 3, 4, 6$ have a sum of $k$. What is the product of these numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the remainder when 100 hours is divided by 24 (hours in a day). 100 ÷ 24 = 4 with a remainder of 4, so h = 4. Then k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11. Next, find three different numbers from [2, 3, 4, 6] that sum to 11. The combination 2, 3, 6 sums to 11 (2 + 3 + 6 = 11). The product of these numbers is 2 × 3 × 6 = 36.\",\n    \"answer\": \"36\"\n}",
