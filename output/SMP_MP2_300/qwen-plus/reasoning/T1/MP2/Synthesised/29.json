  "math_problem": "Which of the following numbers is closest to 1: $\\x0crac{11}{10}$, $\\x0crac{111}{100}$, 1.101, $\\x0crac{1111}{1000}$, 1.011? Instead of determining which of the given numbers is closest to 1, simply find $k = d + \\frac{748889}{1000}$, where $d$ is the value of the number in the list expressed as a fraction with denominator 1000. Luca mixes 50 mL of milk for every 250 mL of flour to make pizza dough. How much milk does he mix with $k$ mL of flour?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, identify the number closest to 1 from the list. The differences from 1 are: 0.1 (11/10), 0.11 (111/100), 0.101 (1.101), 0.111 (1111/1000), and 0.011 (1.011). The smallest difference is 0.011, so the closest number is 1.011, which is 1011/1000. Here, d is the value of this number expressed as a fraction with denominator 1000, so d = 1011/1000. Calculate k = d + 748889/1000 = (1011 + 748889)/1000 = 749900/1000 = 749.9. Luca uses 50 mL milk per 250 mL flour, a ratio of 1:5. Thus, milk required for k mL flour is (50/250) * k = k/5 = 749.9 / 5 = 149.98.\",\n    \"answer\": \"149.98\"\n}",
