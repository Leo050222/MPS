  "math_problem": "Pablo has 27 solid $1 \\\\times 1 \\\\times 1$ cubes that he assembles in a larger $3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 3$ cube. If 10 of the smaller cubes are red, 9 are blue, and 8 are yellow, what is the smallest possible surface area of the larger cube that is red? Instead of determining the minimal total exposed face area contributed by the red small cubes on the surface of the assembled large cube, simply find $d = n + 20$, where $n$ is the number of red small cubes placed in positions exposing three faces in the assembly that achieves this minimum. What is the tens digit of the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of $d$, 16, and 2016?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first analyze the 3×3×3 cube structure. The cube has 8 corners (3 exposed faces), 12 edges (2 faces), 6 face centers (1 face), and 1 inner position (0 faces). To minimize the red surface area, we place red cubes in positions with the fewest exposed faces. With 10 red cubes, we can use: 1 inner (0 faces), 6 face centers (1 face each), and 3 edges (2 faces each), totaling 10 red cubes. This arrangement uses no red cubes in corners, so n = 0. Thus, d = n + 20 = 20.\\n\\nNext, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of d = 20, 16, and 2016. Prime factorizations: 20 = 2²×5, 16 = 2⁴, 2016 = 2⁵×3²×7. The LCM takes the highest powers: 2⁵×3²×5×7 = 10080. The tens digit of 10080 is 8.\",\n    \"answer\": \"8\"\n}",
