  "math_problem": "Pablo has 27 solid $1 \\\\times 1 \\\\times 1$ cubes that he assembles in a larger $3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 3$ cube. If 10 of the smaller cubes are red, 9 are blue, and 8 are yellow, what is the smallest possible surface area of the larger cube that is red? Instead of determining the minimal total exposed face area contributed by the red small cubes on the surface of the assembled large cube, simply find $d = n + 20$, where $n$ is the number of red small cubes placed in positions exposing three faces in the assembly that achieves this minimum. What is the tens digit of the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of $d$, 16, and 2016?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the structure of a $3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 3$ cube composed of 27 unit cubes. The surface area of the large cube is fixed at $6 \\\\times 9 = 54$, but we are concerned with the **red surface area**, i.e., the total number of red faces exposed on the outer surface.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Categorizing Cube Positions\\n\\nEach small cube in the $3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 3$ cube can be classified based on how many of its faces are exposed:\\n\\n- **Corners (8 positions)**: Each has **3 exposed faces**\\n- **Edges (non-corner, 12 positions)**: Each has **2 exposed faces**\\n- **Face centers (6 positions)**: Each has **1 exposed face**\\n- **Center (1 position)**: Has **0 exposed faces**\\n\\nTotal: $8 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 27$, which matches the total number of unit cubes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Minimizing Red Surface Area\\n\\nWe are given:\\n- 10 red cubes\\n- 9 blue cubes\\n- 8 yellow cubes\\n\\nTo **minimize the red surface area**, we want to place as many red cubes as possible in positions with the **fewest exposed faces**.\\n\\nThe optimal strategy is:\\n- Place **1 red cube** in the **center** (0 exposed faces)\\n- Place **6 red cubes** in **face centers** (1 exposed face each)\\n- Place **3 red cubes** in **edges** (2 exposed faces each)\\n\\nThis uses all 10 red cubes and results in:\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Red surface area} = 0 \\\\cdot 1 + 1 \\\\cdot 6 + 2 \\\\cdot 3 = 6 + 6 = 12\\n$$\\n\\nImportantly, **no red cubes are placed in corners**, since that would increase the surface area unnecessarily.\\n\\nThus, the number of red cubes in positions exposing **three faces** (i.e., corners) is:\\n$$\\nn = 0\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Compute $d = n + 20$\\n\\n$$\\nd = 0 + 20 = 20\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Find the Tens Digit of the Smallest Positive Integer Divisible by $d$, 16, and 2016\\n\\nWe compute the **least common multiple (LCM)** of:\\n- $d = 20$\\n- $16$\\n- $2016$\\n\\n#### Prime Factorizations:\\n- $20 = 2^2 \\\\cdot 5$\\n- $16 = 2^4$\\n- $2016 = 2^5 \\\\cdot 3^2 \\\\cdot 7$\\n\\nTake the **maximum exponent** for each prime:\\n- $2^5$\\n- $3^2$\\n- $5^1$\\n- $7^1$\\n\\nSo,\\n$$\\n\\\\text{LCM} = 2^5 \\\\cdot 3^2 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 7 = 32 \\\\cdot 9 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 7 = 10080\\n$$\\n\\nNow, examine the number **10080**:\\n- Digits: **1 0 0 8 0**\\n- The **tens digit** is **8**\", \"answer\": \"8\"}",
