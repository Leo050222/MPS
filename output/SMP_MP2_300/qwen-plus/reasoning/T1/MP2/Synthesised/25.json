  "math_problem": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$. Shuxin begins with $d$ red candies, 7 yellow candies, and 3 blue candies. After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining. What is the smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the scaling factor $ k $. The ratio of skateboards to bicycles is $ 7:4 $, so skateboards = $ 7k $, bicycles = $ 4k $. The difference is $ 7k - 4k = 3k = 12 $, so $ k = 4 $. Then $ d = k + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 $. \\n\\nShuxin starts with $ d = 10 $ red, 7 yellow, and 3 blue candies. To have equal remaining candies, let $ x $ be the number left for each color. The maximum possible $ x $ is the smallest initial count, which is 3 (blue). Remaining: red = 3 (ate 7), yellow = 3 (ate 4), blue = 3 (ate 0). Total eaten = $ 7 + 4 + 0 = 11 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
