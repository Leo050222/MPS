  "math_problem": "A cube has an edge length of 30. A rectangular solid has edge lengths 20, 30, and $L$. If the cube and the rectangular solid have equal surface areas, what is the value of $L$? Instead of determining the third edge length of the rectangular solid, simply find $h = S - 5397$, where $S$ is the surface area of the cube. The line with equation $y = x$ is translated $h$ units to the right and 2 units down. What is the $y$-intercept of the resulting line?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, calculate the surface area of the cube with edge length 30. A cube has 6 faces, each with area $30^2 = 900$. Thus, the surface area $S = 6 \\\\times 900 = 5400$. Next, compute $h = S - 5397 = 5400 - 5397 = 3$. The line $y = x$ translated $h = 3$ units to the right becomes $y = (x - 3)$, and translating 2 units down gives $y = (x - 3) - 2 = x - 5$. The $y$-intercept occurs when $x = 0$, so $y = -5$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-5\"\n}",
