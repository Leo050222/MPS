  "math_problem": "A cube has an edge length of 30. A rectangular solid has edge lengths 20, 30, and $L$. If the cube and the rectangular solid have equal surface areas, what is the value of $L$? Instead of determining the third edge length of the rectangular solid, simply find $h = S - 5397$, where $S$ is the surface area of the cube. The line with equation $y = x$ is translated $h$ units to the right and 2 units down. What is the $y$-intercept of the resulting line?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, calculate the surface area of the cube with edge length 30. The surface area $ S $ of a cube is $ 6 \\\\times \\\\text{edge length}^2 $, so $ S = 6 \\\\times 30^2 = 5400 $. Next, compute $ h = S - 5397 = 5400 - 5397 = 3 $. The line $ y = x $ is translated $ h = 3 $ units to the right, resulting in $ y = (x - 3) $, and then 2 units down, giving $ y = (x - 3) - 2 = x - 5 $. The y-intercept occurs when $ x = 0 $, so substituting $ x = 0 $ yields $ y = -5 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-5\"\n}",
