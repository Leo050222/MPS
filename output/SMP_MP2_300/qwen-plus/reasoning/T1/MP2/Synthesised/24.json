  "math_problem": "A group of friends are sharing a bag of candy. On the first day, they eat $\\x0crac{1}{2}$ of the candies in the bag. On the second day, they eat $\\x0crac{2}{3}$ of the remaining candies. On the third day, they eat $\\x0crac{3}{4}$ of the remaining candies. On the fourth day, they eat $\\x0crac{4}{5}$ of the remaining candies. On the fifth day, they eat $\\x0crac{5}{6}$ of the remaining candies. At the end of the fifth day, there is 1 candy remaining in the bag. How many candies were in the bag before the first day? Instead of determining the initial number of candies in the bag, simply find $k = r - 269$, where $r$ is the number of candies remaining after the first day derived from the consumption on the first day. A sequence of figures is formed using tiles. Each tile is an equilateral triangle with side length 7 cm. The first figure consists of 1 tile. Each figure after the first is formed by adding 1 tile to the previous figure. How many tiles are used to form the figure in the sequence with perimeter $k$ cm?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the initial number of candies. Let N be the initial count. After each day, the remaining candies are multiplied by (1 - fraction eaten):\\n- Day 1: Remaining = N * 1/2\\n- Day 2: Remaining = N * 1/2 * 1/3\\n- Day 3: Remaining = N * 1/2 * 1/3 * 1/4\\n- Day 4: Remaining = N * 1/2 * 1/3 * 1/4 * 1/5\\n- Day 5: Remaining = N * 1/2 * 1/3 * 1/4 * 1/5 * 1/6 = 1\\n\\nThus, N = 2*3*4*5*6 = 720. After Day 1, remaining candies r = 720/2 = 360. Then k = r - 269 = 360 - 269 = 91.\\n\\nFor the tile sequence: Each figure with n tiles has perimeter P = 7*(n + 2) cm (derived from exposed edges: 3n total edges minus 2*(n-1) shared edges). Set P = 91:\\n7*(n + 2) = 91 → n + 2 = 13 → n = 11.\",\n    \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
