  "math_problem": "Each of four doors is randomly either open or closed. What is the probability that exactly two of the four doors are open? Instead of determining the probability of exactly two open doors among the four, simply find $Pr$, where $Pr$ is the probability that exactly two of the four doors are open derived from counting the favorable configurations among all possible states of the doors. The line with equation $y=2x-(Pr + 45/8)$ is translated upwards by 4 units. What is the $x$-intercept of the resulting line?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, calculate the probability Pr that exactly two of four doors are open. Each door has 2 states, so total configurations = 2^4 = 16. Favorable configurations (exactly 2 open) = C(4,2) = 6. Thus, Pr = 6/16 = 3/8. Next, substitute Pr into the line equation: y = 2x - (3/8 + 45/8) = 2x - 6. Translating upwards by 4 units gives y = 2x - 6 + 4 = 2x - 2. To find the x-intercept, set y = 0: 0 = 2x - 2 → x = 1.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
