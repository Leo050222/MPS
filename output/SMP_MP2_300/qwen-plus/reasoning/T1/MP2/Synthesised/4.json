  "math_problem": "If \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers with \\( x>y \\) and \\( x+x y=391 \\), what is the value of \\( x+y \\)? Instead of finding the sum of the two positive integers satisfying the given equation and inequality, simply find \\( k = y + 14 \\), where \\( y \\) is the smaller positive integer in the pair that solves the equation under the stated conditions. There are \\( k \\) people in a room, 60% of whom are men. If no men enter or leave the room, how many women must enter the room so that 40% of the total number of people in the room are men?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the equation $ x + xy = 391 $. Factoring gives $ x(1 + y) = 391 $. The prime factorization of 391 is $ 17 \\\\times 23 $. Valid positive integer pairs $(x, y+1)$ are $(23, 17)$ and $(17, 23)$. Since $ x > y $, $ x = 23 $ and $ y = 16 $ (as $ y+1 = 17 $). Thus, $ k = y + 14 = 16 + 14 = 30 $. \\n\\nNext, with 30 people in the room, 60% are men: $ 0.6 \\\\times 30 = 18 $ men. Let $ w $ be the number of women entering. Total people becomes $ 30 + w $, and men must be 40%: $ 18 = 0.4(30 + w) $. Solving gives $ 18 / 0.4 = 45 = 30 + w $, so $ w = 15 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"15\"\n}",
