  "math_problem": "If \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers with \\( x>y \\) and \\( x+x y=391 \\), what is the value of \\( x+y \\)? Instead of finding the sum of the two positive integers satisfying the given equation and inequality, simply find \\( k = y + 14 \\), where \\( y \\) is the smaller positive integer in the pair that solves the equation under the stated conditions. There are \\( k \\) people in a room, 60% of whom are men. If no men enter or leave the room, how many women must enter the room so that 40% of the total number of people in the room are men?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the equation $ x + xy = 391 $ for positive integers $ x > y $. Factoring gives $ x(1 + y) = 391 $. The prime factorization of 391 is $ 17 \\\\times 23 $. Valid factor pairs (considering $ x > y $) are $ x = 23 $ and $ y + 1 = 17 $, so $ y = 16 $. Then $ k = y + 14 = 16 + 14 = 30 $. Initially, there are 30 people with 60% men: $ 0.6 \\\\times 30 = 18 $ men. Let $ w $ be women entering. Total people becomes $ 30 + w $, and men must be 40%: $ 18 = 0.4(30 + w) $. Solving gives $ w = 15 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"15\"\n}",
