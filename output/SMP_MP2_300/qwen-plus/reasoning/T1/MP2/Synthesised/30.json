  "math_problem": "Anna thinks of an integer that is not a multiple of three, not a perfect square, and the sum of its digits is a prime number. What could the integer be? Instead of identifying an integer satisfying the conditions on multiples of three, perfect squares, and prime digit sums, simply find $k$ equal to the sum of the digits of such an integer plus 108. Ewan writes out a sequence where he counts by 11s starting at 3. Does the number $k$ appear in Ewan's sequence?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we need to find an integer meeting three conditions: not a multiple of 3, not a perfect square, and with a prime digit sum. For example, the integer 5 satisfies all conditions: it is not divisible by 3 (5 mod 3 = 2), not a perfect square, and its digit sum (5) is prime. The value $ k $ is calculated as the digit sum plus 108, so $ k = 5 + 108 = 113 $. Ewan's sequence counts by 11s starting at 3, forming terms $ 3 + 11m $ for $ m \\\\geq 0 $. Checking if 113 is in this sequence: $ 113 = 3 + 11 \\\\times 10 $, which corresponds to $ m = 10 $, confirming 113 is in the sequence. Thus, $ k $ appears in Ewan's sequence.\",\n    \"answer\": \"yes\"\n}",
