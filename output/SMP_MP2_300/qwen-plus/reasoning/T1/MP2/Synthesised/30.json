  "math_problem": "Anna thinks of an integer that is not a multiple of three, not a perfect square, and the sum of its digits is a prime number. What could the integer be? Instead of identifying an integer satisfying the conditions on multiples of three, perfect squares, and prime digit sums, simply find $k$ equal to the sum of the digits of such an integer plus 108. Ewan writes out a sequence where he counts by 11s starting at 3. Does the number $k$ appear in Ewan's sequence?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Anna's integer must satisfy three conditions: not a multiple of 3, not a perfect square, and the sum of its digits is prime. Consider the integer 5: it is not a multiple of 3 (5 % 3 = 2), not a perfect square (5 is between 2²=4 and 3²=9), and the sum of its digits is 5 (a prime number). The sum of the digits is 5, so k = 5 + 108 = 113. Ewan's sequence starts at 3 and increments by 11: 3, 14, 25, 36, 47, 58, 69, 80, 91, 102, 113, ... Checking if 113 is in the sequence: 3 + 11n = 113 → 11n = 110 → n = 10, which is an integer. Thus, 113 appears in Ewan's sequence.\",\n    \"answer\": \"yes\"\n}",
