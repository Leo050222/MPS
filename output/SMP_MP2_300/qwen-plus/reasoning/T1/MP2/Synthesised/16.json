  "math_problem": "Consider the following flowchart: INPUT $\\rightarrow$ Subtract $8 \\rightarrow \\square \\rightarrow$ Divide by $2 \\rightarrow \\square$ Add $16 \\rightarrow$ OUTPUT. If the OUTPUT is 32, what was the INPUT? Instead of determining the initial input value that produces the specified output via the flowchart's sequence of operations, simply find $k = A - 26$, where $A$ is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step. What is the $y$-intercept of the line $y = x + 4$ after it is translated down $k$ units?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The flowchart steps are reversed to find A. Given OUTPUT = 32, subtract 16 to get the value before the last step: 32 - 16 = 16. This value (16) is the result after dividing by 2, so the intermediate value A (before division) is 16 * 2 = 32. Then k = A - 26 = 32 - 26 = 6. Translating the line y = x + 4 down by k = 6 units gives y = x + 4 - 6 = x - 2. The y-intercept of this translated line is -2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-2\"\n}",
