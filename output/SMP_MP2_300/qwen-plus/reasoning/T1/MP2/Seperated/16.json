Setting up the equation: (A / 2) + 16 = 32. Solving gives A / 2 = 16 → A = 32. Then k = A - 26 = 32 - 26 = 6.\\n\\nProblem 2: The original line y = x + 4 has a y-intercept at (0, 4). Translating down 6 units subtracts 6 from the y-values, resulting in y = x + 4 - 6 = x - 2. The new y-intercept is -2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-2\"\n}",
