Instead of determining the initial input value that produces the specified output via the flowchart's sequence of operations, simply find $k = A - 26$, where $A$ is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step."

Multiplying by 2 gives 32 (value at the second square, which is the result after dividing by 2). This 32 is the value of A (the first square after subtracting 8). Thus, k = A - 26 = 32 - 26 = 6.\\n\\nProblem 2: The original line y = x + 4 has a y-intercept at (0, 4). Translating down 6 units subtracts 6 from the y-value, resulting in a new y-intercept of 4 - 6 = -2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-2\"\n}",
