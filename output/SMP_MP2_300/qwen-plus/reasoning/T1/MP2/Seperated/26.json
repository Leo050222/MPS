Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The total capacity C in MB is calculated by converting 300 GB to MB. Since 1 GB = 1024 MB, C = 300 * 1024 = 307200 MB. Then d = C - 307100 = 307200 - 307100 = 100.\\n\\nProblem 2: The regular total price is $320 + $80 = $400. The sale price for the bicycle is 80% of $320 = $256, and for the helmet is 90% of $80 = $72. Total sale price is $256 + $72 = $328. Total savings is $400 - $328 = $72. Percentage savings is ($72 / $400) * 100 = 18%.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"18\"\n}",
