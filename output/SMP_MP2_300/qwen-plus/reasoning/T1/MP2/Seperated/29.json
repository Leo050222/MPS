The given numbers are $\\\\frac{11}{10} = 1.1$, $\\\\frac{111}{100} = 1.11$, $1.101$, $\\\\frac{1111}{1000} = 1.111$, and $1.011$. The differences from 1 are $0.1$, $0.11$, $0.101$, $0.111$, and $0.011$ respectively. The smallest difference is $0.011$, so $1.011$ is closest to 1. Express $1.011$ as a fraction with denominator 1000: $1.011 = \\\\frac{1011}{1000}$, so $d = 1011$. Compute $k = d + \\\\frac{748889}{1000} = 1011 + 748.889 = 1759.889$. However, since $d$ is the numerator (as the value expressed as a fraction over 1000), $k = \\\\frac{1011 + 748889}{1000} = \\\\frac{749900}{1000} = 749.9$. Problem 2: The ratio of milk to flour is $50:250 = 1:5$. For $750$ mL of flour, which is $3 \\\\times 250$ mL, the milk required is $3 \\\\times 50 = 150$ mL.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"749.9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"150\"\n}",
