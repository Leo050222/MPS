Instead of determining the third edge length of the rectangular solid, simply find $h = S - 5397$, where $S$ is the surface area of the cube."

The problem asks for h = S - 5397, where S is the cube's surface area. Thus, h = 5400 - 5397 = 3.\\n\\nProblem 2: Translating the line y = x 3 units right replaces x with (x - 3), giving y = (x - 3). Translating 2 units down subtracts 2, resulting in y = x - 5. The y-intercept occurs at x = 0, so y = -5.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-5\"\n}",
