Instead of determining the probability that the product of the two selected numbers is zero, simply find $k = |S| + 2016$, where $|S|$ is the number of elements in the given set."

Calculating k = |S| + 2016 gives 5 + 2016 = 2021.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need to minimize a + b where 45a + b = 2021 and a, b are positive integers. Express b as 2021 - 45a. Then a + b = 2021 - 44a. To minimize this, maximize a. The largest integer a such that 45a < 2021 is 44 (since 45*44 = 1980). Then b = 2021 - 1980 = 41. Thus, a + b = 44 + 41 = 85.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2021\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"85\"\n}",
