Since $ x > y $ and both are positive integers, valid pairs are $ x = 23 $, $ y + 1 = 17 $ (so $ y = 16 $). Check $ x > y $: 23 > 16 holds. Compute $ k = y + 14 = 16 + 14 = 30 $. Problem 2: Initially, 60% of 30 people are men: $ 0.6 \\\\times 30 = 18 $ men. Women = 12. Let $ w $ be women entering. Total people becomes $ 30 + w $. Men must be 40%: $ 18 = 0.4(30 + w) $. Solve: $ 18 / 0.4 = 45 = 30 + w $, so $ w = 15 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"30\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"15\"\n}",
