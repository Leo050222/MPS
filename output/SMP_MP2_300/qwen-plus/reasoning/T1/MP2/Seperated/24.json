      "A3034": "A group of friends are sharing a bag of candy. On the first day, they eat $\frac{1}{2}$ of the candies in the bag. On the second day, they eat $\frac{2}{3}$ of the remaining candies. On the third day, they eat $\frac{3}{4}$ of the remaining candies. On the fourth day, they eat $\frac{4}{5}$ of the remaining candies. On the fifth day, they eat $\frac{5}{6}$ of the remaining candies. At the end of the fifth day, there is 1 candy remaining in the bag. How many candies were in the bag before the first day? Instead of determining the initial number of candies in the bag, simply find $k = r - 269$, where $r$ is the number of candies remaining after the first day derived from the consumption on the first day."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let the initial number of candies be $ N $. After each day, the remaining candies are multiplied by $ \\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\frac{1}{3}, \\\\frac{1}{4}, \\\\frac{1}{5}, \\\\frac{1}{6} $ respectively. After 5 days, $ N \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{5} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{6} = 1 $. Solving gives $ N = 720 $. The remaining after the first day is $ r = \\\\frac{720}{2} = 360 $. Thus, $ k = 360 - 269 = 91 $. Problem 2: Each tile is an equilateral triangle with side 7 cm. For $ n $ tiles arranged in a straight line, the perimeter is $ 7(n + 2) $. Setting $ 7(n + 2) = 91 $ gives $ n = 11 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"91\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
