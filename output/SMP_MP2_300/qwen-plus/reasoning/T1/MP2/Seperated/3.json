Since 31 is odd, the closest integers are 15 and 16. Their product is 15 × 16 = 240. Subtracting 231 gives k = 240 - 231 = 9.\\n\\nProblem 2: The line segment between (-9, -2) and (6, 8) has Δx = 15 and Δy = 10. The number of integer-coordinate points is gcd(15, 10) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6. These points are spaced every 3 units in x and 2 units in y, confirming 6 lattice points.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
