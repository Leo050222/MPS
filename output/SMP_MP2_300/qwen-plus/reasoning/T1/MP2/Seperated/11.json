There are $N$ lists $a, b, c, d, e$ with a mean of 2023 and a median of 2023, in which the integer 2023 appears more than once, and in which no other integer appears more than once. What is the sum of the digits of $N$? Instead of computing the sum of the digits of the total number of such ordered quintuples, simply find $e = \\left(N - \\frac{21464546}{7}\\right)$, where $N$ is the total number of such ordered quintuples."
