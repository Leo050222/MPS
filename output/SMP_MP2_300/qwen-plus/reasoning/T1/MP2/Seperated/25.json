      "A3077": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$."

Then d = k + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10.\\n\\nProblem 2: To have equal remaining candies, the maximum possible remaining count is the smallest initial count (blue = 3). Remaining: 3 red, 3 yellow, 3 blue. Candies eaten: (10-3) + (7-3) + (3-3) = 7 + 4 + 0 = 11. This is minimal since higher remaining counts are impossible (blue only has 3 initially).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
