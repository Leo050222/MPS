Andras is 23 and Frances is 24, so their combined age is 23 + 24 = 47. Gerta's age (g) is 66 - 47 = 19. Then k = g + 62 = 19 + 62 = 81.\\n\\nProblem 2: First, compute the inner square roots: √81 = 9. The numerator becomes 9 + 9 = 18. Divide by 2: 18 / 2 = 9. Take the square root: √9 = 3.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"81\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
