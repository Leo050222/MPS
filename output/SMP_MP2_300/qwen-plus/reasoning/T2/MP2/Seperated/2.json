      "A1036": "Let $m, n > 2$ be integers. One of the angles of a regular $n$-gon is dissected into $m$ angles of equal size by $(m-1)$ rays. If each of these rays intersects the polygon again at one of its vertices, we say $n$ is $m$-cut. Compute the smallest positive integer $n$ that is both 3-cut and 4-cut. Instead of computing the smallest positive integer $n$ that is both 3-cut and 4-cut, simply find $k = t - \\frac{23}{2}$, where $t$ is the least common multiple of 3 and 4, where this is the smallest positive integer divisible by both values of $m$ in the required cut conditions."

      "A1107": "Alice and Bob play a game on a circle with 8 marked points. Alice places an apple beneath one of the points, then picks five of the other seven points and reveals that none of them are hiding the apple. Bob then drops a bomb on any of the points, and destroys the apple if he drops the bomb either on the point containing the apple or on an adjacent point. Bob wins if he destroys the apple, and Alice wins if he fails. If both players play optimally, what is the probability that Bob destroys the apple?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The problem instructs to compute k = t - 23/2 where t is the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 4. The LCM of 3 and 4 is 12. Thus, k = 12 - 23/2 = 12 - 11.5 = 0.5, which is 1/2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Alice places the apple and reveals 5 non-apple points, leaving 3 candidate points. Bob wins if his bomb covers the apple's location (including adjacent points). For any 3 candidate points on an 8-point circle, there exists a bomb location covering at least 2 points (due to the pigeonhole principle—three points on 8 cannot all be spaced more than 2 apart). Alice, playing optimally, would choose the apple location to minimize Bob's chance, but Bob, knowing the 3 candidates, selects the bomb covering 2 points. Since Alice cannot prevent the 3 candidates from having 2 within distance 2, Bob can always cover 2 out of 3 points. Assuming optimal play where Alice cannot bias the apple location (as both play optimally), the probability Bob wins is 2/3.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2/3\"\n}",
