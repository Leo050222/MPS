Each digit D_i has E[D_i] = 3 and Var(D_i) = E[D_i²] - (E[D_i])² = (91/7) - 9 = 13 - 9 = 4. Since there are 20 digits, Var(S) = 20 * 4 = 80. Thus m = 80 - 65 = 15.\\n\\nProblem 2: The value 3003 appears as C(14,6)=C(14,8), C(15,5)=C(15,10) (so b=5), and C(a,2)=3003. Solving a(a-1)/2 = 3003 gives a=78.
