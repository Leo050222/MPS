The 5th Catalan number is calculated as C_5 = (1/6) * binomial(10,5) = 252/6 = 42. Thus, τ = 42. Then k = τ - 41 = 42 - 41 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need to check if n(n+1) = (2m)(2m+2) for natural numbers n, m. Simplifying, n(n+1) = 4m(m+1). Rearranging leads to the Pell-type equation x² - 4y² = -3 where x = 2n+1 and y = 2m+1. The only positive integer solution is x=1, y=1, which gives n=0 and m=0, not natural numbers. Testing small values and analyzing the equation confirms no valid solutions exist. Thus, the answer is no.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"no\"\n}",
