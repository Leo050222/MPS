The 5th Catalan number is 42. Thus, τ = 42. Calculating k = τ - 41 gives 42 - 41 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need to check if there exist natural numbers m and k such that m(m+1) = (2k)(2k+2). Simplifying, this becomes m(m+1) = 4k(k+1). Rearranging and analyzing the equation leads to a Diophantine equation whose only integer solutions require m or k to be zero, which are not natural numbers (as natural numbers are positive integers). Manual checks of small values also show no matches. Thus, no such numbers exist.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
