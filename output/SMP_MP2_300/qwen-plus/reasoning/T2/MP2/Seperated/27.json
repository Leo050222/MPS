Valid positive integer pairs (x,y) with y > x are (12,13) and (3,6). The smaller y is 6, so k = 6 + 18 = 24.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let n be the answer. The minimum number of colors needed to color divisors of (n-24)! such that no two divisors of the same color have one dividing the other equals the length of the longest chain in the divisor poset, which is Ω((n-24)!) + 1. Solving n = Ω((n-24)!) + 1, we find n = 50 since Ω(26!) = 49 and 49 + 1 = 50.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"24\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"50\"\n}",
