The probability that there exists a time during this process where there are more blue balls than red balls in the jar can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime integers $a$ and $b$. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing 100 times the numerator plus the denominator of the probability expressed in lowest terms, simply find $n$ equal to the greatest common divisor of that numerator and denominator plus 2004."

Using combinatorial analysis and the reflection principle, the valid sequences where blue > red are counted. Total sequences: C(10,2)=45. Favorable sequences: 10 (3 with first 7 reds, 7 with one blue in first 7 and second at position 10). Probability: 10/45 = 2/9. gcd(2,9)=1, so n=1+2004=2005.\\n\\nProblem 2: Each subdivision of the L-shape produces 4 smaller L-shapes. Due to rotational symmetry, after n subdivisions, each of the 4 orientations is equally likely. Total L-shapes: 4^2005. Same orientation count: 4^2005 / 4 = 4^2004.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2005\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4^2004\"\n}",
