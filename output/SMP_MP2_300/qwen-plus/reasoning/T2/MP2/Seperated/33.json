Coordinates: D(0,1), E(1/3,1), F(1/3,4/3), G(0,4/3). Line CF: from (1,1) to (1/3,4/3), slope -1/2, equation y = -1/2 x + 3/2. Line AG is x=0 (y-axis). Intersection X at (0, 3/2). AX = 3/2. Compute k = AX + 29/2 = 3/2 + 29/2 = 16.\\n\\nProblem 2: The condition requires S to be closed under x ↦ 2x mod 16. The structure forms a tree where each node's inclusion requires its image (toward 0). Using dynamic programming on the reverse tree (edges x → 2x mod 16), leaves (odd numbers) have 2 choices each. Nodes with two leaf children (2,10,6,14) have 5 choices. Nodes 4,12 (with two children of 5 choices) have 26 choices. Node 8 (with two children of 26 choices) has 677 choices. Root 0 gives total sets as 1 + 677 = 678 (including empty set).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"16\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"678\"\n}",
