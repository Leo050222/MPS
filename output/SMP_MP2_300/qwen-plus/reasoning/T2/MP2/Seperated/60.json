Now he walks from $(0,0)$ to $(8,0)$ without ever going below the $x$-axis. How many such paths are there? Instead of counting the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,0) that never go below the x-axis, simply find $k = m - 49$, where $m$ is the number of lattice paths from (0,-2) to (8,0) using steps of (+1,+1) or (+1,-1) derived from the reflection principle to count paths that violate the non-negativity condition."

The net y-change is +2, so up steps (U) and down steps (D) satisfy U + D = 8 and U - D = 2. Solving gives U = 5, D = 3. The number of such paths is C(8,5) = 56. Thus, m = 56. Then k = m - 49 = 56 - 49 = 7.\\n\\nProblem 2: Multiples of 7 that are perfect squares between 10^6 and 10^9 must be of the form (7m)^2 = 49m^2. Solve 10^6 ≤ 49m^2 ≤ 10^9. This gives m_min = ceil(sqrt(10^6/49)) = 143 and m_max = floor(sqrt(10^9/49)) = 4517. The count is 4517 - 143 + 1 = 4375.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"7\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4375\"\n}",
