Additionally, the area of quadrilateral $B X I Y$ is $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the area of $A B C$. Let $p$ be the smallest possible perimeter of a $\\triangle A B C$ that meets these conditions and has integer side lengths. Find the smallest possible area of such a triangle with perimeter $p$. Instead of determining the smallest possible area of a triangle satisfying the incircle and area conditions with the minimal integer-sided perimeter, simply find $e = (s + 2305)$, where $s$ is the semiperimeter of a triangle achieving that minimal perimeter."

For integer sides, $ s = 5k $, $ b = 3k $, and $ a + c = 7k $. The minimal perimeter occurs at $ k = 1 $, giving perimeter $ 10 $ and semiperimeter $ s = 5 $. Thus, $ e = 5 + 2305 = 2310 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: For $ n \\\\mid 2310 $, $ p(n) = n^{d(n)/2} $. $ p(n) $ is a perfect square if $ d(n)/2 $ is even (for $ n > 1 $) or $ n = 1 $. Divisors of 2310 have $ m $ prime factors ($ 0 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 5 $).
