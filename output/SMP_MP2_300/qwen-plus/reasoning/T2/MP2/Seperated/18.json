Additionally, the area of quadrilateral $B X I Y$ is $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the area of $A B C$. Let $p$ be the smallest possible perimeter of a $\\triangle A B C$ that meets these conditions and has integer side lengths. Find the smallest possible area of such a triangle with perimeter $p$. Instead of determining the smallest possible area of a triangle satisfying the incircle and area conditions with the minimal integer-sided perimeter, simply find $e = (s + 2305)$, where $s$ is the semiperimeter of a triangle achieving that minimal perimeter."

For integer sides, $ s = 5k $ and $ b = 3k $, giving perimeter $ 10k $. The smallest $ k = 1 $ yields perimeter $ 10 $ with sides $ 3, 3, 4 $, satisfying all conditions. The semiperimeter $ s = 5 $, so $ e = 5 + 2305 = 2310 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Divisors of $ 2310 $ (prime factorization $ 2 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 11 $) are square-free. The product of divisors $ p(n) = n^{d(n)/2} $ is a perfect square if $ d(n)/2 $ is even or $ n = 1 $. This holds for all divisors except primes ($ k = 1 $). Total divisors: $ 32 $; primes: $ 5 $.
