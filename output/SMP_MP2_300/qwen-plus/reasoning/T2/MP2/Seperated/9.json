The reciprocal sum equation 1/2 + 1/x = 1/p + 1/q (with p, q distinct odd primes) leads to x = 2pq/(2p + 2q - pq). Solving for positive integer x, the only valid primes are p=3, q=5, giving x=30. The four numbers are 2, 3, 5, 30. LCM(2, 3, 5, 30) = 30, so ℓ=30 and k=30-10=20.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a random permutation π of {1,..., 100}, π^20(20)=20 implies 20 is in a cycle of length dividing 20 (6 divisors), and π^21(21)=21 implies 21 is in a cycle of length dividing 21 (4 divisors). The cycles for 20 and 21 are disjoint (gcd(20,21)=1), so the number of valid permutations is 6*4*98!. Total permutations are 100! = 100*99*98!. Probability = (24*98!)/(100*99*98!) = 24/9900 = 2/825. Thus, a=2, b=825, and 100a + b = 1025.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"20\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1025\"\n}",
