The reciprocal sum condition 1/2 + 1/b = 1/c + 1/d leads to c=3, d=5 (distinct odd primes), giving b=30. The numbers are 2, 3, 5, 30. Their LCM is 30, so ℓ=30 and k=30-10=20.\\n\\nProblem 2: The probability that π²⁰(20)=20 and π²¹(21)=21 requires 20 to be in a cycle length dividing 20 (6 options) and 21 in a cycle length dividing 21 (4 options). The number of valid permutations is 6×4×98! = 24×98!. Total permutations are 100! = 100×99×98!. The probability simplifies to 24/(100×99) = 2/825. Thus, a=2, b=825, and 100a+b=1025.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"20\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1025\"\n}",
