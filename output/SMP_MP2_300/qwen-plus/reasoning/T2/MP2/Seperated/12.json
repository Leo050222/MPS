Tunnels are drilled through the pyramid in such a way that one can move from $(x, y, z)$ to any of the 9 points $(x, y, z-1),(x \\pm 1, y, z-1)$, $(x, y \\pm 1, z-1),(x \\pm 1, y \\pm 1, z-1)$. Sean starts at $Y$ and moves randomly down to the base of the pyramid, choosing each of the possible paths with probability $\\frac{1}{9}$ each time. What is the probability that he ends up at the point $(8,9,0)$? Instead of computing the probability of reaching the specified base point, simply find $e = \\left(p_y - \\frac{25}{3}\\right)$, where $p_y$ is the number of steps with positive y-displacement required to achieve the net y-displacement to that point, derived from the total step count and net displacement equations in the y-direction."

Let $ a $ be steps with $ +1 $ y-displacement, $ c $ with $ -1 $, and $ b $ with $ 0 $. We have $ a - c = 9 $ and $ a + b + c = 10 $. Solving gives $ a = 9 $, so $ p_y = 9 $. Thus, $ e = 9 - \\\\frac{25}{3} = \\\\frac{2}{3} $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The maximum winning number $ m $ must satisfy $ m = \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\times \\\\text{average} $. For $ m $ to be maximum, the average must be as high as possible. The highest possible average with integer constraints is 99 (since $ m = 66 $ requires average 99). To achieve this, $ N $ people must have sum $ 99N $, with one person writing 66 and others writing 100. Solving $ 66 + 100(N-1) = 99N $ gives $ N = 34 $, the smallest $ N $ where this is feasible.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2/3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"34\"\n}",
