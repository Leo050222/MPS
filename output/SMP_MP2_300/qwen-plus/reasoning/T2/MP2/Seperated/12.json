Tunnels are drilled through the pyramid in such a way that one can move from $(x, y, z)$ to any of the 9 points $(x, y, z-1),(x \\pm 1, y, z-1)$, $(x, y \\pm 1, z-1),(x \\pm 1, y \\pm 1, z-1)$. Sean starts at $Y$ and moves randomly down to the base of the pyramid, choosing each of the possible paths with probability $\\frac{1}{9}$ each time. What is the probability that he ends up at the point $(8,9,0)$? Instead of computing the probability of reaching the specified base point, simply find $e = \\left(p_y - \\frac{25}{3}\\right)$, where $p_y$ is the number of steps with positive y-displacement required to achieve the net y-displacement to that point, derived from the total step count and net displacement equations in the y-direction."

A person wins the game if their number is exactly two-thirds of the average of all the numbers written down. There can be multiple winners or no winners in this game. Let \\(m\\) be the maximum possible number such that it is possible to win the game by writing down \\(m\\).

Let a be steps with dy=+1, c with dy=-1. Then a - c = 9 and a + c ≤ 10. Solving gives a=9, c=0. Thus p_y=9. Compute e = 9 - 25/3 = 2/3.\\n\\nProblem 2: Maximum winning number m must satisfy m = (2/3)average. Max m=66 (since (2/3)*100≈66.66). For m=66, average=99. Sum=99N.
