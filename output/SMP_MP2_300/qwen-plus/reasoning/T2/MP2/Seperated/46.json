Thus, $ k = 70 - 67 = 3 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need to minimize $ \\\\frac{r}{s} $ for integers $ r, s $ satisfying $ 3r \\\\geq 2s - 3 $ and $ 4s \\\\geq r + 12 $. Rearranging inequalities gives $ r \\\\geq \\\\frac{2s - 3}{3} $ and $ r \\\\leq 4s - 12 $. For $ s \\\\geq 4 $, the smallest valid $ r $ for each $ s $ is $ \\\\lceil \\\\frac{2s - 3}{3} \\\\rceil $. Testing values shows the minimum ratio occurs at $ (r, s) = (2, 4) $ or $ (3, 6) $, yielding $ \\\\frac{r}{s} = \\\\frac{1}{2} $. No smaller positive ratio is possible due to constraints.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/2\"\n}",
