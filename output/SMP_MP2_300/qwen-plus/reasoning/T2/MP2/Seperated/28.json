First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill 11. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The system of equations is solved by expressing z from the third equation and substituting into the first two. This leads to a quadratic equation in x: x² - 18x + 72 = 0, with roots x = 6 and x = 12. The problem specifies the smaller root for x + 1, which corresponds to x = 6 (since x + 1 = 7 vs 13). Substituting x = 6 into the equations gives y = 27/5 and z = 38/5. Then k = z + 17/5 = (38 + 17)/5 = 55/5 = 11.\\n\\nProblem 2: The expected number of games Alice plays is determined by considering symmetry and linearity of expectation. For each of the 10 players with skill > 11 and 10 players with skill < 11, the probability Alice plays against them is 1/11. Summing these gives 10/11 + 10/11 = 20/11. This accounts for all possible encounters where Alice either defeats lower-skilled players or loses to higher-skilled ones, with the expectation derived from the random selection process.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"20/11\"\n}",
