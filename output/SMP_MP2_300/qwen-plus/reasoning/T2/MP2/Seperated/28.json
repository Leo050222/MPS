First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill 11. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?"

Solving for $ z $ from the first equation: $ z = 40 - xy $. Substituting into the second equation gives $ y = \\\\frac{40x - 51}{x^2 - 1} $. Substituting $ y $ and $ z $ into the third equation leads to $ x + \\\\frac{91}{x + 1} = 19 $, which simplifies to $ x^2 - 18x + 72 = 0 $. The roots are $ x = 6 $ and $ x = 12 $. The smaller root for $ x + 1 $ is $ 7 $ (corresponding to $ x = 6 $). For $ x = 6 $, solving gives $ z = \\\\frac{38}{5} $. Thus, $ k = z + \\\\frac{17}{5} = \\\\frac{38}{5} + \\\\frac{17}{5} = \\\\frac{55}{5} = 11 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Alice (skill 11) has 10 players with lower skill (L) and 10 with higher skill (H). The expected number of games she plays depends on whether she starts active or inactive. If active (probability $ \\\\frac{1}{21} $), the expected games are $ 1 + \\\\frac{10}{11} = \\\\frac{21}{11} $. If inactive (probability $ \\\\frac{20}{21} $), the expected games are calculated by considering the initial active player: if it's L (probability $ \\\\frac{10}{20} $), she wins and plays $ 1 + \\\\frac{9}{11} $ more games; if H (probability $ \\\\frac{10}{20} $), she loses immediately. Averaging over all cases gives the total expectation as $ \\\\frac{21}{11} $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"21/11\"\n}",
