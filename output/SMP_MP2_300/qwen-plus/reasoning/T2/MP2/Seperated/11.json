      "A1433": "During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^{2}$. Instead of determining the real part of the square of the starting point, simply find $k = |z| - 1$, where $|z|$ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days."

The ID number satisfies the following property: the first two digits is a number divisible by 2, the first three digits is a number divisible by 3, etc. so that the ID number itself is divisible by 6. One ID number that satisfies this condition is 123252. How many different possibilities are there for Bob's ID number?"

For Saturday, the path length is |z² - 1| * r * (1 - r^{2012}) / (1 - r²) and for Sunday it is |z² - 1| * (1 - r^{2012}) / (1 - r²), where r = |z|. Setting them equal gives r = 1 (assuming non-zero terms). Thus, k = |z| - 1 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: The ID number must satisfy divisibility conditions. Key steps:\\n- d5 = 5 (divisible by 5).\\n- d2 even (2,4,6,8).\\n- d3d4 divisible by 4 (18 pairs, 6 per congruence class mod 3).\\n- For each valid (d1,d2), 6 (d3,d4) pairs and 9 d6 choices (based on modular constraints). Total count: 9 (d1) * 4 (d2) * 6 (d3,d4) * 9 (d6) = 1944.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1944\"\n}",
