Find $a_{N}(0)$. Instead of determining the value of the leading digit polynomial evaluated at zero, simply find $e = (v + 1012)$, where $v = a_{N}(0)$ and $a_{N}(x)$ is the leading digit polynomial in the unique base-$b(x)$ representation."

Since $ b(x) = x^2 + x + 1 $, we note $ x^3 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod b(x) $. The degree of $ S $ is 2015 (odd), so the leading term in the base-$ b(x) $ expansion comes from a linear digit $ a_N(x) = x + d $ with $ 2N + 1 = 2015 \\\\Rightarrow N = 1007 $. The coefficient of $ x^{2014} $ in $ S $ is 1. In $ a_N(x)b(x)^N $, the coefficient of $ x^{2014} $ is $ N + d $. Solving $ 1007 + d = 1 $ gives $ d = -1006 $, so $ a_N(0) = -1006 $. Then $ e = v + 1012 = -1006 + 1012 = 6 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: A regular 6-gon has 14 triangulations (Catalan number $ C_4 = 14 $). The only triangulations where a triangle has no original edges are the two with central triangles $ \\\\{1,3,5\\\\} $ and $ \\\\{2,4,6\\\\} $. Subtracting these 2 bad cases gives $ 14 - 2 = 12 $ valid triangulations where every triangle has at least one side of the original polygon.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
