      "A3322": "A rubber band is 4 inches long. An ant begins at the left end. Every minute, the ant walks one inch along rightwards along the rubber band, but then the band is stretched (uniformly) by one inch. For what value of $n$ will the ant reach the right end during the $n$th minute? Instead of determining the minute during which the ant reaches the right end, simply find $p$, where $e = p + \\frac{23}{4}$, where $p$ is the portion of the rubber band's length traversed by the ant during the first minute accounting for the uniform stretch."

Stretching uniformly does not change the fraction of the band traversed, so the portion p is 1/4. The equation e = p + 23/4 is given, but p is directly the portion during the first minute, which is 1/4.\\n\\nProblem 2: For six students, the probability that no student has to pass another is 2^(n-1)/n! = 32/720 = 2/45. Thus, the probability that at least one student has to pass is 1 - 2/45 = 43/45.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"43/45\"\n}",
