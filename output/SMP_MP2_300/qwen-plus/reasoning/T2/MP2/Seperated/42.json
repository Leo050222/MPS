Here, r=4 and s=3 are coprime (gcd(4,3)=1). Thus, k = gcd(r,s) + 0 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The sum ∑_{i=1}^∞ (i+1)(i+2)(i+3)/(-2)^i is evaluated using generating functions. Recognize (i+1)(i+2)(i+3) = 6C(i+3,3), so the generating function is 6/(1 - x)^4 for |x| < 1. Adjusting for the sum starting at i=1 and substituting x = -1/2, compute 6/(1 - (-1/2))^4 - 6 = 6/(3/2)^4 - 6 = 32/27 - 6 = -130/27.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-130/27\"\n}",
