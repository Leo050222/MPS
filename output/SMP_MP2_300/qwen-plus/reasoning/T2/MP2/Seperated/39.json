Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition."

Given $ 8w = 3w^2 $, solving $ 3w^2 - 8w = 0 $ gives $ w = \\\\frac{8}{3} $ (since $ w > 0 $). Then $ d = w + \\\\frac{37}{3} = \\\\frac{8}{3} + \\\\frac{37}{3} = \\\\frac{45}{3} = 15 $. Problem 2: Let ladder length be $ L $. Initially, base $ = 15 $ ft, height $ = h $, so $ L^2 = 15^2 + h^2 $. After moving, base $ = 24 $ ft, height $ = h - 13 $, so $ L^2 = 24^2 + (h - 13)^2 $. Equating: $ 225 + h^2 = 576 + h^2 - 26h + 169 $. Simplifying gives $ 26h = 520 $, so $ h = 20 $. Then $ L^2 = 15^2 + 20^2 = 625 $, so $ L = 25 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"15\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"25\"\n}",
