      "A2644": "The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to $k>0$, find $k$. Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let width = w, length = 3w. Perimeter = 2(w + 3w) = 8w. Area = w * 3w = 3w². Given perimeter = area, so 8w = 3w² → 3w² - 8w = 0 → w(3w - 8) = 0. Since w > 0, w = 8/3. Then d = w + 37/3 = 8/3 + 37/3 = 45/3 = 15.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let ladder length = L. Initially, base = 15 ft, height = h. So 15² + h² = L². After moving, base = 15 + 9 = 24 ft, height = h - 13. Thus 24² + (h - 13)² = L². Equate both: 225 + h² = 576 + h² - 26h + 169 → 225 = 745 - 26h → 26h = 520 → h = 20. Then L² = 15² + 20² = 625 → L = 25.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"15\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"25\"\n}",
