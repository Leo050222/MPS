  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To denest $\\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}}$, assume it equals $\\\\sqrt{x} + \\\\sqrt{y}$. Squaring both sides gives $x + y + 2\\\\sqrt{xy} = 15 + \\\\sqrt{216}$. Equating rational and irrational parts: $x + y = 15$ and $2\\\\sqrt{xy} = \\\\sqrt{216} = 6\\\\sqrt{6}$. Solving $\\\\sqrt{xy} = 3\\\\sqrt{6}$ leads to $xy = 54$. The quadratic $t^2 - 15t + 54 = 0$ factors as $(t-6)(t-9)=0$, so $x=9$, $y=6$. Thus, $\\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}} = 3 + \\\\sqrt{6}$, giving $a=3$, $b=6$. Then $k = a + 3 = 6$.\\n\\nProblem 2: This is a modified coupon collector problem. For a 6-sided die with no consecutive repeats, the expected time to collect all numbers is calculated using states based on collected numbers. Let $E[k]$ be the expected rolls from $k$ distinct numbers. The recurrence is $E[k] = E[k+1] + \\\\frac{5}{6-k}$ with $E[6] = 0$. Summing from $k=1$ to $5$: $E[1] = 5\\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{137}{12}$. Adding the first roll, total expectation is $1 + \\\\frac{137}{12} = \\\\frac{149}{12}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"149/12\"\n}",
