  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To denest $\\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}}$, assume it equals $\\\\sqrt{x} + \\\\sqrt{y}$. Squaring both sides gives $15 + \\\\sqrt{216} = x + y + 2\\\\sqrt{xy}$. Equating rational and irrational parts: $x + y = 15$ and $2\\\\sqrt{xy} = \\\\sqrt{216} = 6\\\\sqrt{6}$. Solving $\\\\sqrt{xy} = 3\\\\sqrt{6}$ yields $xy = 54$. The quadratic $t^2 - 15t + 54 = 0$ has roots $t = 9$ and $t = 6$. Thus, $\\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}} = \\\\sqrt{9} + \\\\sqrt{6} = 3 + \\\\sqrt{6}$. Here, $a = 3$ and $b = 6$. The problem asks for $k = a + 3 = 6$.\\n\\nProblem 2: This is a modified coupon collector problem where the die cannot roll the same number twice in a row. Define $E[k]$ as the expected rolls needed to collect all 6 numbers starting from $k$ distinct numbers. The recurrence is $E[k] = \\\\frac{5}{6 - k} + E[k + 1]$ for $1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 5$, with $E[6] = 0$. Calculating step-by-step:\\n- $E[5] = 5$\\n- $E[4] = \\\\frac{5}{2} + 5 = \\\\frac{15}{2}$\\n- $E[3] = \\\\frac{5}{3} + \\\\frac{15}{2} = \\\\frac{55}{6}$\\n- $E[2] = \\\\frac{5}{4} + \\\\frac{55}{6} = \\\\frac{125}{12}$\\n- $E[1] = 1 + \\\\frac{125}{12} = \\\\frac{137}{12}$\\nThe total expected rolls include the first roll, so $1 + E[1] = 1 + \\\\frac{137}{12} = \\\\frac{149}{12}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"149/12\"\n}",
