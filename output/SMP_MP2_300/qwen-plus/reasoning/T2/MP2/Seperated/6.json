In each pair, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is knocked out of the tournament. The probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other during the tournament is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of evaluating the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator representing the probability that the two designated players meet during the tournament, simply find $e = b - 16$, where $b$ is the denominator of that probability when expressed as a reduced fraction."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: In a knockout tournament with 32 players, the probability that two specific players (Ava and Tiffany) meet is determined by the general result for such tournaments with random pairings each round. For N = 2^n players, the probability that two specific players meet is 2/N. Here, N = 32, so the probability is 2/32 = 1/16. The denominator b is 16. The problem asks for e = b - 16, which is 16 - 16 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: Analyze the expression x^p * [ (1 - (1+x)^10) / (1 + (1+x)^10) ] for small x > 0. Using the binomial expansion, (1+x)^10 ≈ 1 + 10x for small x, so the numerator ≈ -10x and the denominator ≈ 2. The ratio ≈ -5x. Multiplying by x^p gives -5x^{p+1}. For this to approach a constant c as x → 0+, the exponent p+1 must be 0, so p = -1. The limit is -5, so c = -5. The ordered pair is (-1, -5).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(-1, -5)\"\n}",
