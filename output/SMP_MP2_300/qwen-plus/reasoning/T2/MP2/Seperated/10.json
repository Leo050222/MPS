How many ways can one mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent? Instead of counting the total number of ways to mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent, simply find $e = w + 2019$, where $w$ is the number of ways to mark one square in each of nine consecutive rows such that no two marked squares in adjacent rows share the same column."

In a $ 10 \\\\times 2 $ grid, there are two sets of nine consecutive rows: rows 1–9 and rows 2–10. For each set of nine rows, the number of valid configurations (alternating columns) is 2 (starting with column 1 or 2). Thus, $ w = 2 + 2 = 4 $. Therefore, $ e = 4 + 2019 = 2023 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need the maximum $ n - m $ such that $ [m, n) $ contains more multiples of 2021 than 2000. The key is to find the longest interval where the count of multiples of 2021 exceeds that of 2000 by at least 1. Through analysis, the maximum occurs when the interval spans 96 blocks of 2000, adjusted to include 96 multiples of 2021 and 95 multiples of 2000. The maximum length is $ 2000 \\\\times 96 - 1 = 191999 $, verified by ensuring the counts satisfy the condition.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2023\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"191999\"\n}",
