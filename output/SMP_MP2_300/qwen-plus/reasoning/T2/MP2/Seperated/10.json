How many ways can one mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent? Instead of counting the total number of ways to mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent, simply find $e = w + 2019$, where $w$ is the number of ways to mark one square in each of nine consecutive rows such that no two marked squares in adjacent rows share the same column."

There are two possible blocks of nine consecutive rows (rows 1–9 and rows 2–10). For each block, the valid configurations alternate columns (e.g., column 1, 2, 1, ... or column 2, 1, 2, ...), yielding 2 ways per block. Thus, $ w = 2 + 2 = 4 $. Then $ e = w + 2019 = 4 + 2019 = 2023 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize $ n - m $ such that $[m, n)$ contains more multiples of 2021 than 2000, consider intervals where the count of 2021 multiples exceeds 2000 multiples by 1. The maximum occurs when the interval spans 96 multiples of 2021 and 95 multiples of 2000. The length of such an interval is $ 2000 \\\\times 96 - 1 = 191999 $, verified by aligning multiples using the Chinese Remainder Theorem and ensuring the interval avoids an extra multiple of 2000 while including all 96 multiples of 2021.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2023\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"191999\"\n}",
