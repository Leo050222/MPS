Two balls are randomly drawn from the urn without replacement. Find the probability, in percent, that the first ball drawn is white and the second is black. Instead of determining the percentage probability of drawing a white ball followed by a black ball without replacement, simply find $d = m - 74$, where $m$ is the total number of balls in the urn derived from the condition that this probability is an integer percentage."

After correcting the misinterpretation that $ n $ (the answer) equals $ m - 74 $, we analyze the condition where the probability $ \\\\frac{n \\\\cdot 74}{m(m-1)} \\\\times 100 $ must be an integer. Through detailed analysis of divisors and testing values, the smallest valid $ m $ satisfying the conditions is $ m = 76 $, leading to $ d = 76 - 74 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The recurrence relation $ x_{n+1} = 2x_n - x_{n-1} + 2^n $ with initial conditions $ x_1 = 1 $, $ x_2 = 2 $ is solved by finding the homogeneous solution $ A + Bn $ and a particular solution $ 2^{n+1} $. Combining these and applying initial conditions yields the closed-form $ x_n = 2^{n+1} - 3n $. Substituting $ n = 2012 $ gives $ x_{2012} = 2^{2013} - 3 \\\\times 2012 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2^{2013} - 6036\"\n}",
