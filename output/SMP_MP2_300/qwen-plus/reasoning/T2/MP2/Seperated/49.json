Instead of determining the probability of obtaining exactly two distinct colors in the sample, simply find $k = \\binom{5}{2} + 80$, where $\\binom{5}{2}$ is the number of ways to choose the two distinct colors from the five available."

Calculating $ \\\\binom{5}{2} = \\\\frac{5 \\\\times 4}{2} = 10 $, so $ k = 10 + 80 = 90 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The points $ P $ lie on the angle bisector of $ \\\\angle BAC $ and satisfy $ \\\\angle BPC = 90^\\\\circ $. The locus of such $ P $ is the circle with diameter $ BC $. The distance between the two intersection points of the angle bisector with this circle is the chord length, calculated as $ 2\\\\sqrt{r^2 - d^2} $, where $ r = \\\\frac{55}{2} $ (radius) and $ d $ is the distance from the circle's center (midpoint of $ BC $) to the angle bisector. Using coordinate geometry and the Law of Cosines, the chord length simplifies to $ \\\\frac{5\\\\sqrt{409}}{2} $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"90\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"5*sqrt(409)/2\"\n}",
