The largest possible area of the smallest sector can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b} \\pi$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100a+b$. Instead of computing the numerical identifier formed by the numerator and denominator of the reduced fractional coefficient of $\\pi$ expressing the largest possible area of the smallest sector, simply find $k$, where $k$ is four greater than the denominator of that fraction."

The key is that two diameters provide four radii (antipodal pairs), and the fifth radius breaks symmetry. The central angles must satisfy symmetry constraints. By setting the smallest central angles equal and solving, the maximum minimum central angle is π/3. The area of the smallest sector is (π/3)/2 = π/6, so a=1, b=6. The problem asks for k = b + 4 = 10.\\n\\nProblem 2: Check numbers >10 for equal digit sums in base 10 and base 17. For N=153, base 10 digits sum to 1+5+3=9, and base 17 (9*17 + 0) sums to 9+0=9. This is the smallest such number.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"153\"\n}",
