Let $p$ be the probability that for every positive integer $k<10$, there exists an integer $k^{\\prime}>k$ such that there is at most one number between $k$ and $k^{\\prime}$ in the circle. If $p$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing one hundred times the numerator plus the denominator when the probability is expressed as a reduced fraction, simply find $k = p + \\frac{167}{90}$, where $p$ is the probability for the circular arrangement satisfying the given condition."
