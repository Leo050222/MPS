Instead of computing the probability that the sum of the randomly selected set is divisible by 3, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the number of ways to choose all five numbers congruent to 0 modulo 3 plus the number of ways to choose two numbers congruent to 1 modulo 3."

First, the number of ways to choose all five numbers congruent to 0 modulo 3: there are 5 such numbers (3,6,9,12,15), so C(5,5)=1. Second, the number of ways to choose two numbers congruent to 1 modulo 3: there are 5 such numbers (1,4,7,10,13), so C(5,2)=10. Adding these gives k=1+10=11.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need n such that φ(n)=11³+1=1332. Factorizing 1332=2²×3²×37. Considering n=37²×2 (product of three primes: 2,37,37), φ(n)=φ(37²)×φ(2)=37×36×1=1332. This fits the condition and the hint about 'products of three primes'. Thus, n=2×37²=2738.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2738\"\n}",
