  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The problem defines k as the sum of two terms. First, the number of ways to choose all five numbers congruent to 0 modulo 3. From the first 15 positive integers, there are 5 numbers ≡0 mod3 (3,6,9,12,15), so C(5,5)=1. Second, the number of ways to choose two numbers congruent to 1 mod3. There are 5 numbers ≡1 mod3 (1,4,7,10,13), so choosing 2 from these gives C(5,2)=10. The remaining 3 numbers must be chosen from the other 10 numbers (residues 0 and 2), which is C(10,3)=120. Thus, the second term is 10*120=1200. Adding both terms: 1 + 1200 = 1201.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need n such that φ(n) = 11³ + 1 = 1332. Given n is a product of three primes (with multiplicity) and the form suggests 37² as a factor. Testing n = 2×37²: φ(n) = φ(2)×φ(37²) = 1×(37² - 37) = 1332. This fits, as 2×37×37 is a product of three primes (with multiplicity). Other possibilities like 2×7×223 also work but do not include 37², which aligns with the problem's hint (n=37²⋅...). Thus, the intended answer is 2738.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1201\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2738\"\n}",
