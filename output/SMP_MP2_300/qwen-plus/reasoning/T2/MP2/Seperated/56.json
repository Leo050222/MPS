Since numbers ending in 4 have $ f(n) = 0 $, $ f(74) = 0 $. By additivity, $ f(74) = f(37) + f(2) $. Also, 4 ends in 4, so $ f(4) = 0 $, and $ f(4) = 2f(2) $ implies $ f(2) = 0 $. Thus, $ 0 = f(37) + 0 $, so $ f(37) = 0 $. Hence, $ k = 0 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of paths from (0,0) to (4,4) without crossing $ y > x $ is the 4th Catalan number.
