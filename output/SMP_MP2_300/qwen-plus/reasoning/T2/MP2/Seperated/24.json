Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let n be the initial number of balls in Box B. Box A starts with n/2 balls. After moving 80 balls from A to B, Box A has (n/2 - 80) and Box B has (n + 80). The ratio is (n/2 - 80)/(n + 80) = (n - 160)/(2(n + 80)). This ratio simplifies to p/q where gcd(p, q) = 1. Since the ratio is in simplest terms, gcd(p, q) = 1. The problem asks for k = g + 3 where g is this gcd, so k = 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nProblem 2: The trapezoid has bases 5 and 4, height 4, with vertices at (0,0), (5,0), (4,4), (0,4). Midpoints of sides are connected, forming two lines: y = 2 (horizontal) and y = -8x + 20. These intersect at (2.25, 2). The four regions have areas 19/4, 19/4, 17/4, 17/4. The largest area is 19/4, smallest is 17/4. Difference d = 1/2. Thus, 240d = 120.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"120\"\n}",
