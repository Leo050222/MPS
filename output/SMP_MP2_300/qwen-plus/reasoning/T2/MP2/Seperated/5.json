However, Alice and Jane refuse to serve together, meaning any committee containing both is invalid. Thus, there are 0 valid committees in this scenario.\\n\\nProblem 2: The ant moves diagonally each second, changing x and y by ±1. To reach (2010, 2010) in 4020 steps, the net displacement in both x and y must be 2010. This requires 3015 right steps (R) and 1005 left steps (L) in each direction. The number of ways to choose R steps in x is C(4020, 3015) = C(4020, 1005), and similarly for y. Since x and y choices are independent, the total number of paths is [C(4020, 1005)]².\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"C(4020,1005)^2\"\n}",
