Instead of determining the total number of valid committee selections, simply find $k$, the number of valid committees when the must-serve-together pair is excluded and the refusing-to-serve-together pair is both included."

However, Alice and Jane refuse to serve together, so any committee including both is invalid. Thus, there are 0 valid committees in this scenario.\\n\\nProblem 2: The ant moves diagonally, changing x and y by ±1 each step. To reach (2010, 2010) in 4020 steps, the x and y displacements each require 3015 net positive steps. Since x and y movements are independent, the number of ways is the square of the binomial coefficient C(4020, 1005), as choosing 1005 left/down steps out of 4020 for each axis.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"C(4020,1005)^2\"\n}",
