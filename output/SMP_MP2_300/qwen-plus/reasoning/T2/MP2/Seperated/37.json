Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of determining the encoded numerical representation of the pentagon's area in radical form, simply find $k = CE - 8$, where $CE$ is the common length of the specified equal chords derived from the given segment lengths along the intersecting lines."

Using the intersecting chords theorem at $X$ and $Y$, we derive equations for the common chord length $L = CE$. Solving these equations yields two potential solutions $L = 9$ and $L = 17$. By analyzing the convexity and order of intersection points on $BD$, we determine $L = 17$ is valid. Thus, $k = CE - 8 = 17 - 8 = 9$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a unit square $ABCD$ with $A(0,0)$, $B(1,0)$, $C(1,1)$, $D(0,1)$, a circle tangent to $AB$ at $E(h,0)$ has center $(h, r)$ where $r = 32/49$. The circle passes through $D(0,1)$, so the distance from the center to $D$ equals $r$. Solving gives $h = \\\\sqrt{15}/7$. The distance $DE$ is calculated as $\\\\sqrt{(\\\\sqrt{15}/7)^2 + 1^2} = 8/7$, so $m = 8$, $n = 7$, and $100m + n = 807$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"807\"\n}",
