Instead of computing the maximum possible sum of two positive integers not exceeding 100 that satisfy the given equation relating their product to the square of the ratio of their least common multiple to their greatest common divisor, simply find $m = s - 77$, where $s$ is that maximum possible sum."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let $d = \\\\gcd(a, b)$, so $a = dx$, $b = dy$ with $\\\\gcd(x, y) = 1$. The equation becomes $d^2xy = (xy)^2$, so $d^2 = xy$. Since $x$ and $y$ are coprime, they must be perfect squares: $x = m^2$, $y = n^2$, $d = mn$ (with $\\\\gcd(m, n) = 1$). Thus, $a = m^3n$, $b = mn^3$. To maximize $a + b = mn(m^2 + n^2)$ under $a, b \\\\leq 100$, test coprime pairs $(m, n)$. The largest valid sum is $24 + 54 = 78$ (for $m=2, n=3$). Then $m = 78 - 77 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: To avoid axis-parallel rectangles, any two rows must share at most one red column. Using double counting, the maximum number of red squares $T$ satisfies $\\\\sum \\\\binom{c_j}{2} \\\\leq \\\\binom{5}{2} = 10$, where $c_j$ is the count of reds in column $j$. Solving $T^2 \\\\leq 5(T + 20)$ gives $T \\\\leq 12$. A valid configuration achieves 12 red squares (e.g., rows with reds in columns [1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [1,5], [2,3,4,5]), confirming 12 is maximum.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
