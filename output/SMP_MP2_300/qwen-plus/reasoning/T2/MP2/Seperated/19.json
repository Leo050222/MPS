Instead of computing the maximum possible sum of two positive integers not exceeding 100 that satisfy the given equation relating their product to the square of the ratio of their least common multiple to their greatest common divisor, simply find $m = s - 77$, where $s$ is that maximum possible sum."

The equation $ab = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)}{\\\\gcd(a, b)}\\\\right)^2$ simplifies to $d^2 mn = (mn)^2$, hence $d^2 = mn$. Since $\\\\gcd(m, n) = 1$, $m$ and $n$ must be perfect squares, say $m = k^2$, $n = l^2$ with $\\\\gcd(k, l) = 1$. Thus, $d = kl$, so $a = k^3 l$, $b = k l^3$. We need $a, b \\\\leq 100$. Testing coprime pairs $(k, l)$:\\n- $(1, 4)$: $a = 4$, $b = 64$, sum $68$\\n- $(2, 3)$: $a = 24$, $b = 54$, sum $78$\\n- Other pairs yield smaller sums or exceed 100. The maximum sum $s = 78$, so $m = s - 77 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: To avoid axis-parallel rectangles, any two rows must share at most one red column. Using combinatorial bounds, the maximum number of red squares in a $5 \\\\times 5$ grid without such rectangles is known to be 12 (via Zarankiewicz problem $z(5,5,2,2) = 12$). Constructing such a configuration confirms this (e.g., rows with column subsets ensuring pairwise intersections of size $\\\\leq 1$).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
