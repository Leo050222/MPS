Let $a$ be the proportion of pixels that are black. Estimate $A=\\lfloor 10000 a\\rfloor$. An estimate of $E$ will earn $\\left\\lfloor 20 \\min \\left(\\frac{A}{E}, \\frac{E}{A}\\right)^{12}\\right\\rfloor$ points.

Calculating this gives 1,048,576 - 1,048,572 = 4.\\n\\nProblem 2: In rock-scissors, the optimal strategy is to always play rock, giving a 50% chance to win each game (win when computer plays scissors, tie when computer plays rock). The number of wins in 8 games follows a binomial distribution with n=8 and p=0.5. The probability of at least 4 wins is the sum of probabilities for k=4 to 8. Calculating the binomial coefficients: C(8,4)=70, C(8,5)=56, C(8,6)=28, C(8,7)=8, C(8,8)=1. Summing these gives 163. The total probability is 163/256.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"163/256\"\n}",
