Let $a$ be the proportion of pixels that are black. Estimate $A=\\lfloor 10000 a\\rfloor$.

Calculating gives 1,048,576 - 1,048,572 = 4.\\n\\nProblem 2: The optimal strategy is to always play rock, giving a 50% chance to win each game (since computer plays scissors 50% of the time). Wins follow a binomial distribution with n=8, p=0.5. The probability of at least 4 wins is the sum of probabilities for k=4 to 8. Using binomial coefficients: C(8,4)=70, C(8,5)=56, C(8,6)=28, C(8,7)=8, C(8,8)=1. Total favorable outcomes = 70+56+28+8+1=163. Total possible outcomes = 2^8=256.
