  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To find all positive integers $n$ such that $\\\\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7}$ is a positive integer, we perform polynomial division: $n^3 + 3 = n(n^2 + 7) - 7n + 3$. Thus, $\\\\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7} = n - \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7}$. For this to be an integer, $\\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7}$ must be an integer. Analyzing when $n^2 + 7$ divides $7n - 3$, we find valid $n$ values are 2 and 5. For $n=2$, the expression equals 1, so $k = 2 - 1 = 1$. For $n=5$, the expression equals 4, so $k = 5 - 4 = 1$. Thus, $k=1$ for all valid $n$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let the roots of $2x^2 - mx - 8$ be $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$. By Vieta's formulas, $\\\\alpha + \\\\beta = \\\\frac{m}{2}$ and $\\\\alpha\\\\beta = -4$. The condition that the roots differ by $m - 1$ gives $|\\\\alpha - \\\\beta| = |m - 1|$. Using $(\\\\alpha - \\\\beta)^2 = (\\\\alpha + \\\\beta)^2 - 4\\\\alpha\\\\beta$, we derive $(m - 1)^2 = \\\\left(\\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\right)^2 + 16$. Solving $3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0$ yields $m = 6$ and $m = -\\\\frac{10}{3}$. Both satisfy the condition as the difference (signed) equals $m - 1$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6, -10/3\"\n}",
