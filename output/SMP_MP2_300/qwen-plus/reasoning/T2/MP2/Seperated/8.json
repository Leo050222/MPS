      "A1269": "Teresa the bunny has a fair 8-sided die. Seven of its sides have fixed labels $1,2, \\ldots, 7$, and the label on the eighth side can be changed and begins as 1. She rolls it several times, until each of $1,2, \\ldots, 7$ appears at least once. After each roll, if $k$ is the smallest positive integer that she has not rolled so far, she relabels the eighth side with $k$. The probability that 7 is the last number she rolls is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the specified linear combination from the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process, simply find $m = q_0 + 3999/4$, where $q_0$ is the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process derived from the recursive probability analysis of the states based on the number of distinct fixed labels collected."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability that 7 is the last number rolled is determined by analyzing the recursive structure of the problem. For a general n, the probability that the highest number n is last follows the recurrence q(n) = [n / (n + 1)] * q(n - 1) with q(1) = 1. Solving this gives q(n) = 2 / (n + 1). For n = 7, this yields q(7) = 2 / 8 = 1/4. Thus, a = 1, b = 4, and 100a + b = 104.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of triples (a, b, c) with a ≤ b ≤ c, gcd(a, b, c) = 1, and abc = 6^2020 is computed using inclusion-exclusion and Burnside's lemma. The ordered count of triples with gcd 1 is (6060)^2. Converting to unordered triples gives (6060^2 + 12) / 6 = 6,120,602. The remainder when divided by 1000 is 602.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"104\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"602\"\n}",
