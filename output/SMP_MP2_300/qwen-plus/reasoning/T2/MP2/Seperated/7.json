Find $a+b$. Instead of finding the sum of the coefficients corresponding to the two smallest denominators, simply find $L = b + 2004$, where $b$ is the integer coefficient of the term with denominator $13$ in the restricted partial fraction decomposition."

Multiplying both sides by $2015 = 5 \\\\times 13 \\\\times 31$ gives $1 = 403a + 155b + 65c$. Solving modulo 5: $3a \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 5$ gives $a = 2$. Substituting $a = 2$ yields $31b + 13c = -161$. Solving modulo 13: $8(b + 1) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod 13$ gives $b = 12$. Thus $L = b + 2004 = 12 + 2004 = 2016$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let $E(L)$ be the expected number of cuts for a string of length $L$. For $L \\\\geq 1$, $E(L) = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{L} \\\\int_0^L E(x) \\\\, dx$. Differentiating gives $E'(L) = \\\\frac{1}{L}$, so $E(L) = \\\\ln L + C$. Using $E(1) = 1$ (since cutting a length 1 string always requires 1 cut), $C = 1$.
