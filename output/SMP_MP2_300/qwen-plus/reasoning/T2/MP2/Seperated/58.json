Instead of determining the length of the base $BC$, simply find $d = AY - 4$, where $AY$ is the length of the segment from $A$ to $Y$ along the angle bisector, and $Y$ is the point of tangency of the incircle with $BC$."

The distance from I to BC is the inradius r = 2. Given AI = 3, the total altitude AY (from A to the tangency point Y on BC) is AI + r = 3 + 2 = 5. Thus, d = AY - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The alternating sum S(n) = n! - (n-1)! + (n-2)! - ... ± 1! is computed for small n. For n = 3, S(3) = 6 - 2 + 1 = 5, which is prime. This is the smallest valid n ≤ 25 where the sum is prime.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
