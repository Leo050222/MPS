Instead of determining the length of the base $BC$, simply find $d = AY - 4$, where $AY$ is the length of the segment from $A$ to $Y$ along the angle bisector, and $Y$ is the point of tangency of the incircle with $BC$."

The distance from I to BC is the inradius r = 2. Given AI = 3, the total length AY (from A to the tangency point Y on BC along the angle bisector) is AI + r = 3 + 2 = 5. Thus, d = AY - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Evaluating the alternating sum for small n:\\n- n=1: 1! = 1 (not prime)\\n- n=2: 2! - 1! = 1 (not prime)\\n- n=3: 3! - 2! + 1! = 6 - 2 + 1 = 5 (prime).
