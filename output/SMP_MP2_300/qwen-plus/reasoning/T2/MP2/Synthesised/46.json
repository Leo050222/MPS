  "math_problem": "Consider 8-digit numbers, where the first digit is from 1 to 9, the other digits are from 0 to 9, and exactly four of the digits are 9. Count how many such numbers there are. Instead of counting the total number of such 8-digit numbers, simply find $k = \\binom{8}{4} - 67$, where $\\binom{8}{4}$ is the number of ways to choose the four positions for the 9's. $r$ and $s$ are integers such that $3 r \\geq 2 s - k$ and $4 s \\geq r + 12$. What is the smallest possible value of $r / s$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute $ k = \\\\binom{8}{4} - 67 $. Since $ \\\\binom{8}{4} = 70 $, we have $ k = 70 - 67 = 3 $. The inequalities become $ 3r \\\\geq 2s - 3 $ and $ 4s \\\\geq r + 12 $. Rearranging, $ r \\\\geq \\\\frac{2s - 3}{3} $ and $ r \\\\leq 4s - 12 $. For integer solutions, $ s $ must be at least 4 (since $ s = 3 $ leads to no valid $ r $). Testing small values of $ s $:\\n- For $ s = 4 $: $ r \\\\geq \\\\frac{5}{3} \\\\approx 1.67 \\\\Rightarrow r \\\\geq 2 $, and $ r \\\\leq 4 $. The smallest $ r/s $ is $ 2/4 = 0.5 $.\\n- For $ s = 6 $: $ r \\\\geq 3 $, $ r \\\\leq 12 $, giving $ 3/6 = 0.5 $.\\nSmaller $ s $ values (e.g., $ s = 3 $) yield no valid $ r $. Negative $ s $ values lead to contradictions in inequalities. No $ r/s < 0.5 $ exists, as shown by algebraic analysis. Thus, the smallest $ r/s $ is $ 1/2 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/2\"\n}",
