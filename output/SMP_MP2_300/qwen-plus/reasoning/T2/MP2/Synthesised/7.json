  "math_problem": "The fraction $\\frac{1}{2015}$ has a unique \"(restricted) partial fraction decomposition\" of the form $\\frac{1}{2015}=\\frac{a}{5}+\\frac{b}{13}+\\frac{c}{31}$ where $a, b, c$ are integers with $0 \\leq a<5$ and $0 \\leq b<13$. Find $a+b$. Instead of finding the sum of the coefficients corresponding to the two smallest denominators, simply find $L = b + 2004$, where $b$ is the integer coefficient of the term with denominator $13$ in the restricted partial fraction decomposition. Katherine has a piece of string that is $L$ millimeters long. She cuts the string at a location chosen uniformly at random, and takes the left half. She continues this process until the remaining string is less than one millimeter long. What is the expected number of cuts that she makes?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, factorize 2015 = 5 × 13 × 31. The partial fraction decomposition of 1/2015 is given by 1/2015 = a/5 + b/13 + c/31. Multiplying both sides by 2015 gives 1 = 403a + 155b + 65c. Solving modulo 5, 403 ≡ 3 mod 5, so 3a ≡ 1 mod 5 ⇒ a = 2 (since 0 ≤ a < 5). Substituting a = 2, we get 155b + 65c = -805, which simplifies to 31b + 13c = -161. Solving modulo 13, 31 ≡ 5 mod 13 and -161 ≡ 8 mod 13, so 5b ≡ 8 mod 13 ⇒ b = 12 (since 0 ≤ b < 13). Thus, L = b + 2004 = 12 + 2004 = 2016.\\n\\nFor the expected number of cuts: Let E(S) be the expected cuts for a string of length S. For S ≥ 1, E(S) = 1 + (1/S)∫₀^S E(x) dx. Solving this integral equation yields E(S) = 1 + ln S for S ≥ 1. For L = 2016, the expected number of cuts is 1 + ln(2016).\",\n    \"answer\": \"1 + ln(2016)\"\n}",
