  "math_problem": "The fraction $\\frac{1}{2015}$ has a unique \"(restricted) partial fraction decomposition\" of the form $\\frac{1}{2015}=\\frac{a}{5}+\\frac{b}{13}+\\frac{c}{31}$ where $a, b, c$ are integers with $0 \\leq a<5$ and $0 \\leq b<13$. Find $a+b$. Instead of finding the sum of the coefficients corresponding to the two smallest denominators, simply find $L = b + 2004$, where $b$ is the integer coefficient of the term with denominator $13$ in the restricted partial fraction decomposition. Katherine has a piece of string that is $L$ millimeters long. She cuts the string at a location chosen uniformly at random, and takes the left half. She continues this process until the remaining string is less than one millimeter long. What is the expected number of cuts that she makes?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, factorize 2015 = 5 × 13 × 31. The equation for partial fractions is 1 = 403a + 155b + 65c. Solving modulo 5 gives 3a ≡ 1 mod 5 ⇒ a = 2. Substituting a = 2 yields 31b + 13c = -161. Solving modulo 13 gives 8(b + 1) ≡ 0 mod 13 ⇒ b = 12 (since 0 ≤ b < 13). Thus, L = 12 + 2004 = 2016. For the expected number of cuts, define E(x) as the expected cuts starting from length x. For x ≥ 1, E(x) = 1 + (1/x)∫₀ˣ E(t) dt. Solving the differential equation gives E(x) = 1 + ln x. Therefore, E(2016) = 1 + ln(2016).\",\n    \"answer\": \"1+ln(2016)\"\n}",
