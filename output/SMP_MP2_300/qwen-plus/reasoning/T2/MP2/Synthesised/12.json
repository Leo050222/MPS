  "math_problem": "Pyramid $E A R L Y$ is placed in $(x, y, z)$ coordinates so that $E=(10,10,0), A=(10,-10,0), R=(-10,-10,0), L=(-10,10,0)$, and $Y=(0,0,10)$. Tunnels are drilled through the pyramid in such a way that one can move from $(x, y, z)$ to any of the 9 points $(x, y, z-1),(x \\pm 1, y, z-1)$, $(x, y \\pm 1, z-1),(x \\pm 1, y \\pm 1, z-1)$. Sean starts at $Y$ and moves randomly down to the base of the pyramid, choosing each of the possible paths with probability $\\frac{1}{9}$ each time. What is the probability that he ends up at the point $(8,9,0)$? Instead of computing the probability of reaching the specified base point, simply find $p_y$, where $p_y$ is the number of steps with positive y-displacement required to achieve the net y-displacement to that point, derived from the total step count and net displacement equations in the y-direction. In a game, $N$ people are in a room. Each of them simultaneously writes down an integer between 0 and 100 inclusive. A person wins the game if their number is exactly $\\left(p_y - \\frac{25}{3}\\right)$ of the average of all the numbers written down. There can be multiple winners or no winners in this game. Let $m$ be the maximum possible number such that it is possible to win the game by writing down $m$. Find the smallest possible value of $N$ for which it is possible to win the game by writing down $m$ in a room of $N$ people.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine p_y for the y-displacement. Sean starts at Y=(0,0,10) and ends at (8,9,0), so net y-displacement is +9 over 10 steps. Let a be steps with dy=+1, c with dy=-1. Then a - c = 9 and a + c ≤ 10. Solving gives a=9, c=0, so p_y=9. Next, compute p_y - 25/3 = 9 - 25/3 = 2/3. The winning condition is a number m = (2/3) * average. To maximize m, set m as large as possible such that m = (2/3)A, where A is the average. The maximum m occurs when A is maximized under constraints. For m=66, A=99. The sum of all numbers is 99N, and sum = 66 + S (S from other N-1 numbers). S = 99N - 66 must satisfy S ≤ 100(N-1), leading to N ≥ 34. For N=34, S=3300=33*100, which is valid (33 people write 100). Smaller N (e.g., 33) fails as S exceeds 100(N-1). Thus, the smallest N is 34.\",\n    \"answer\": \"34\"\n}",
