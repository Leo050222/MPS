Line $C F$ meets line $A G$ at $X$. The length $A X$ can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing the hundredfold numerator plus the denominator of the intersection length in reduced terms, simply find $k = AX + \\frac{29}{2}$, where $AX$ is the distance from $A$ to the intersection point $X$. Compute the number of sets $S$ such that every element of $S$ is a nonnegative integer less than $k$, and if $x \\in S$ then $(2 x \\bmod k) \\in S$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration of the two squares $ABCD$ and $DEFG$, with side lengths 1 and $\\\\frac{1}{3}$ respectively. The key is to determine the intersection point $X$ of line $CF$ and line $AG$, then compute the length $AX$. \\n\\n### Step 1: Coordinate Setup\\n\\nWe place square $ABCD$ in a coordinate system such that:\\n- $A = (0, 0)$\\n- $B = (0, 1)$\\n- $C = (1, 1)$\\n- $D = (1, 0)$\\n\\nThis makes $ABCD$ a unit square with sides aligned along the axes.\\n\\nSince $E$ lies on segment $\\\\overline{CD}$, which runs from $C(1,1)$ to $D(1,0)$, and the square $DEFG$ has side length $\\\\frac{1}{3}$, we find:\\n- $E = (1, \\\\frac{1}{3})$\\n\\nFrom this, we construct square $DEFG$ such that it extends to the right (to ensure $G$ lies on the x-axis beyond $D$):\\n- $F = (\\\\frac{4}{3}, \\\\frac{1}{3})$\\n- $G = (\\\\frac{4}{3}, 0)$\\n\\nThus, points $A(0,0)$, $D(1,0)$, and $G(\\\\frac{4}{3}, 0)$ lie on the x-axis in order.\\n\\n### Step 2: Find Intersection Point $X$\\n\\nWe now find where line $CF$ intersects line $AG$.\\n\\n- Line $CF$ connects $C(1,1)$ and $F(\\\\frac{4}{3}, \\\\frac{1}{3})$. Its slope is:\\n  $$\\n  m = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{3} - 1}{\\\\frac{4}{3} - 1} = \\\\frac{-\\\\frac{2}{3}}{\\\\frac{1}{3}} = -2\\n  $$\\n  So the equation of line $CF$ is:\\n  $$\\n  y - 1 = -2(x - 1) \\\\Rightarrow y = -2x + 3\\n  $$\\n\\n- Line $AG$ is the x-axis ($y = 0$).\\n\\nSetting $y = 0$ in the equation of $CF$:\\n$$\\n0 = -2x + 3 \\\\Rightarrow x = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\n$$\\n\\nSo the intersection point $X = (\\\\frac{3}{2}, 0)$.\\n\\n### Step 3: Compute $AX$\\n\\nThe distance from $A(0,0)$ to $X(\\\\frac{3}{2}, 0)$ is:\\n$$\\nAX = \\\\left| \\\\frac{3}{2} - 0 \\\\right| = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 4: Compute $k = AX + \\\\frac{29}{2}$\\n\\n$$\\nk = \\\\frac{3}{2} + \\\\frac{29}{2} = \\\\frac{32}{2} = 16\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 5: Count Valid Sets $S$\\n\\nWe are to count the number of subsets $S \\\\subseteq \\\\{0, 1, ..., 15\\\\}$ such that if $x \\\\in S$, then $(2x \\\\mod 16) \\\\in S$.\\n\\nThis condition implies that $S$ must be **closed under the function** $f(x) = 2x \\\\mod 16$. This defines a directed graph where each node $x$ points to $f(x)$, forming a tree rooted at 0.\\n\\nUsing recursive counting based on the structure of this graph:\\n\\n- **Leaves (level 4):** 8 nodes (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15), each with 2 valid subsets (include or not).\\n- **Level 3 nodes (2, 6, 10, 14):** Each has 2 children; total subsets per node = $1 + 2 \\\\times 2 = 5$\\n- **Level 2 nodes (4, 12):** Each has 2 children; total subsets per node = $1 + 5 \\\\times 5 = 26$\\n- **Level 1 node (8):** Has 2 children; total subsets = $1 + 26 \\\\times 26 = 677$\\n\\nThis gives the number of closed subsets of $\\\\{1, ..., 15\\\\}$ as 677. Adding the empty set (which is also valid), the total number of valid sets $S$ is:\\n$$\\n677 + 1 = 678\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"678\"}",
