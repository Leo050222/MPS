  "math_problem": "Eight points are chosen on the circumference of a circle, labelled $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{8}$ in clockwise order. A route is a sequence of at least two points $P_{a_{1}}, P_{a_{2}}, \\ldots, P_{a_{n}}$ such that if an ant were to visit these points in their given order, starting at $P_{a_{1}}$ and ending at $P_{a_{n}}$, by following $n-1$ straight line segments (each connecting each $P_{a_{i}}$ and $P_{a_{i+1}}$ ), it would never visit a point twice or cross its own path. Find the number of routes. Instead of determining the total number of such routes, simply find $k = r - 1092$, where $r$ is the number of valid routes starting from the designated point $P_8$. Let $A B C D E F G H$ be an equilateral octagon with $\\angle A \\cong \\angle C \\cong \\angle E \\cong \\angle G$ and $\\angle B \\cong \\angle D \\cong \\angle F \\cong \\angle H$. If the area of $A B C D E F G H$ is three times the area of $A C E G$, then $\\sin B$ can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\gcd(m, n)=k$. Find $100 m+n$.",

A route is defined as a sequence of at least two distinct points such that the path does not cross itself or revisit any point.\\n\\n### Step 1: Counting Valid Routes Starting at $ P_8 $\\n\\nLet’s denote the total number of valid routes starting at $ P_8 $ as $ r $. The key insight is that for $ n $ points on a circle (excluding the starting point), the number of non-crossing paths starting at a fixed vertex is given by:\\n\\n$$\\nr = \\\\frac{3^{n} - 1}{2}\\n$$\\n\\nHere, $ n = 7 $ (since there are 7 other points besides $ P_8 $). Thus:\\n\\n$$\\nr = \\\\frac{3^7 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{2187 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{2186}{2} = 1093\\n$$\\n\\nThe problem defines $ k = r - 1092 $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nk = 1093 - 1092 = 1\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Solving the Octagon Area Problem\\n\\nWe are given an equilateral octagon $ ABCDEFGH $ with alternating angles:\\n- $ \\\\angle A = \\\\angle C = \\\\angle E = \\\\angle G = \\\\alpha $\\n- $ \\\\angle B = \\\\angle D = \\\\angle F = \\\\angle H = \\\\beta $\\n\\nFrom the polygon angle sum formula:\\n\\n$$\\n4\\\\alpha + 4\\\\beta = 1080^\\\\circ \\\\Rightarrow \\\\alpha + \\\\beta = 270^\\\\circ \\\\Rightarrow \\\\alpha = 270^\\\\circ - \\\\beta\\n$$\\n\\nWe are told that the area of the octagon is three times the area of quadrilateral $ ACEG $.
