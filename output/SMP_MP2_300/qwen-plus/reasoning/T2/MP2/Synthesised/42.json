  "math_problem": "Find all pairs of integers $ (x,y)$, such that\n\\[ x^2 - 2009y + 2y^2 = 0 \\] Instead of finding all pairs of integers $(x,y)$ satisfying the given Diophantine equation, simply find $k = \\gcd(r,s) + 0$, where $r$ and $s$ are the coprime positive integers appearing in the representation of the odd prime factor $p$ of $2009$ (after extracting square factors) as $p = 2r^2 + s^2$, derived from the analysis required to solve the equation. Evaluate $\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(i+k)(i+2)(i+3)}{(-2)^{i}}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, factorize 2009: 2009 = 7² × 41. The square-free part is 41, an odd prime. We need to express 41 as 2r² + s² with coprime positive integers r, s. Testing values, 2(4)² + 3² = 32 + 9 = 41, so r=4, s=3. gcd(4,3)=1, so k = 1 + 0 = 1.\\n\\nNext, evaluate the sum Σ_{i=1}^∞ [(i+1)(i+2)(i+3)] / (-2)^i. Recognize (i+1)(i+2)(i+3) as the third derivative-related term. The generating function for Σ_{i=0}^∞ (i+1)(i+2)(i+3)x^i is 6/(1−x)^4. For x = -1/2, the sum from i=0 is 6/(3/2)^4 = 32/27. Subtract the i=0 term (6) to get the sum from i=1: 32/27 − 6 = -130/27.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-130/27\"\n}",
