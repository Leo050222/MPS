  "math_problem": "Compute the radius of the inscribed circle of a triangle with sides 15, 16, and 17. Instead of computing the inradius of the triangle, simply find $s$, the semi-perimeter of the triangle. What is the smallest positive integer $x$ for which $x^{2}+x+(s + 17)$ is not a prime?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute the semi-perimeter $ s $ of the triangle with sides 15, 16, and 17. The perimeter is $ 15 + 16 + 17 = 48 $, so $ s = \\\\frac{48}{2} = 24 $. Next, substitute $ s $ into the expression $ x^2 + x + (s + 17) $, which becomes $ x^2 + x + (24 + 17) = x^2 + x + 41 $. We need to find the smallest positive integer $ x $ for which this expression is not prime. The polynomial $ x^2 + x + 41 $ is known to generate primes for $ x = 0 $ to $ x = 39 $. For $ x = 40 $, the value is $ 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 1681 = 41^2 $, which is composite. Checking all smaller positive integers confirms they yield primes, so the smallest $ x $ is 40.\",\n    \"answer\": \"40\"\n}",
