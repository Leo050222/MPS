  "math_problem": "Farmer John has 5 cows, 4 pigs, and 7 horses. Assume that all animals are distinguishable from each other. How many ways can he pair up the animals so that every pair consists of animals of different species? Instead of determining the total number of ways to pair up all the animals into mixed-species pairs, simply find $k = x + 2$, where $x$ is the number of cow-pig pairs in any such complete pairing. Compute the number of ways to color $k$ cells in a $3 \\times 3$ grid so that no two colored cells share an edge.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"First, determine the number of cow-pig pairs (x) in any valid complete pairing. Farmer John has 5 cows (C), 4 pigs (P), and 7 horses (H), totaling 16 animals (8 pairs). Let:\\n- $ a $ = cow-pig pairs,\\n- $ b $ = cow-horse pairs,\\n- $ c $ = pig-horse pairs.\\n\\nFrom species counts:\\n- Cows: $ a + b = 5 $,\\n- Pigs: $ a + c = 4 $,\\n- Horses: $ b + c = 7 $.\\n\\nSolving:\\n1. From $ a + b = 5 $, $ b = 5 - a $.\\n2. From $ a + c = 4 $, $ c = 4 - a $.\\n3. Substitute into $ b + c = 7 $: $ (5 - a) + (4 - a) = 7 \\\\Rightarrow 9 - 2a = 7 \\\\Rightarrow a = 1 $.\\n\\nThus, $ x = 1 $ (cow-pig pairs), so $ k = x + 2 = 3 $.\\n\\nNext, count ways to color 3 cells in a $ 3 \\\\times 3 $ grid with no two adjacent (sharing an edge). The grid has 9 cells. Valid configurations for 3 non-adjacent cells:\\n\\n**Case 1: Center cell (5) is colored**  \\n- Remaining 2 cells must be corners (1, 3, 7, 9), which are non-adjacent.  \\n- Ways: $ \\\\binom{4}{2} = 6 $.\\n\\n**Case 2: Center cell is not colored**  \\n- All 3 cells are on the perimeter (8 cells: corners 1,3,7,9 and edges 2,4,6,8).\\n  - **Subcase 2a: 3 corners**  \\n    - $ \\\\binom{4}{3} = 4 $.\\n  - **Subcase 2b: 2 corners, 1 edge**  \\n    - Only valid if corners share a row/column (4 such pairs), each allowing 1 edge: $ 4 \\\\times 1 = 4 $.\\n  - **Subcase 2c: 1 corner, 2 edges**  \\n    - Each corner allows 2 edges (non-adjacent), choose 2: $ 4 \\\\times 1 = 4 $.\\n  - **Subcase 2d: 3 edges**  \\n    - Edges are non-adjacent: $ \\\\binom{4}{3} = 4 $.\\n- Total for Case 2: $ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 $.\\n\\n**Total colorings**: $ 6 + 16 = 22 $.\", \"answer\": \"22\"}",
