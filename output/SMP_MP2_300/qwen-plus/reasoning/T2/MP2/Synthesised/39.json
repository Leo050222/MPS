  "math_problem": "The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to $k>0$, find $k$. Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition. A ladder is leaning against a house with its lower end $d$ feet from the house. When the lower end is pulled 9 feet farther from the house, the upper end slides 13 feet down. How long is the ladder (in feet)?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Let the width of the rectangle be $ w $. Then the length is $ 3w $. The perimeter is $ 2(w + 3w) = 8w $ and the area is $ w \\\\cdot 3w = 3w^2 $. Given both equal $ k $, we have $ 8w = 3w^2 $. Solving $ 3w^2 - 8w = 0 $ gives $ w(3w - 8) = 0 $, so $ w = \\\\frac{8}{3} $ (since $ w > 0 $). Then $ d = w + \\\\frac{37}{3} = \\\\frac{8}{3} + \\\\frac{37}{3} = \\\\frac{45}{3} = 15 $. \\n\\nFor the ladder problem: initially, the base is $ d = 15 $ ft. After moving, the base becomes $ 15 + 9 = 24 $ ft, and the top slides down 13 ft. Let $ L $ be the ladder length and $ h $ the initial height. Then:\\n- Initial: $ h^2 + 15^2 = L^2 $\\n- After moving: $ (h - 13)^2 + 24^2 = L^2 $\\n\\nEquating both: $ h^2 + 225 = (h - 13)^2 + 576 $. Expanding gives $ h^2 + 225 = h^2 - 26h + 169 + 576 $. Simplifying: $ 225 = -26h + 745 $, so $ 26h = 520 $ and $ h = 20 $. Then $ L^2 = 20^2 + 15^2 = 625 $, so $ L = 25 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"25\"\n}",
