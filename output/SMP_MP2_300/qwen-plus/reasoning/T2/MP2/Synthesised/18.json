  "math_problem": "In $\\triangle A B C$, the incircle centered at $I$ touches sides $A B$ and $B C$ at $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Additionally, the area of quadrilateral $B X I Y$ is $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the area of $A B C$. Let $p$ be the smallest possible perimeter of a $\\triangle A B C$ that meets these conditions and has integer side lengths. Find the smallest possible area of such a triangle with perimeter $p$. Instead of determining the smallest possible area of a triangle satisfying the incircle and area conditions with the minimal integer-sided perimeter, simply find $s$, where $s$ is the semiperimeter of a triangle achieving that minimal perimeter. For a positive integer $n$, let $p(n)$ denote the product of the positive integer factors of $n$. Determine the number of factors $n$ of $(s + 2305)$ for which $p(n)$ is a perfect square.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric condition involving triangle $ \\\\triangle ABC $ and its incircle. The key insight is that the area of quadrilateral $ BXIY $, formed by the incenter $ I $ and the points where the incircle touches sides $ AB $ and $ BC $, is given to be $ \\\\frac{2}{5} $ of the total area of triangle $ ABC $. \\n\\nUsing standard triangle geometry:\\n- Let $ s = \\\\frac{a + b + c}{2} $ be the semiperimeter.\\n- The inradius is $ r $, and the area of triangle $ ABC $ is $ \\\\Delta = r s $.\\n- The area of quadrilateral $ BXIY $ is $ (s - b) r $, since it's composed of two right triangles with legs $ s - b $ and $ r $.\\n\\nGiven $ (s - b) r = \\\\frac{2}{5} r s $, dividing both sides by $ r $ yields:\\n$$\\ns - b = \\\\frac{2}{5}s \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad b = \\\\frac{3}{5}s\\n$$\\nThis implies that side $ b $ (opposite vertex $ B $) must equal $ \\\\frac{3}{5}s $, or equivalently, $ s = \\\\frac{5}{3}b $.\\n\\nSince all side lengths are integers, $ s $ must be a multiple of 5. Let $ s = 5k $, so $ b = 3k $, and the other two sides satisfy $ a + c = 7k $. Triangle inequalities require:\\n$$\\n2k < a < 5k\\n$$\\nThus, for integer values of $ k $, we seek the smallest perimeter $ p = 2s = 10k $ such that there exist integer side lengths $ a, b, c $ satisfying the above conditions.\\n\\nTrying $ k = 1 $:\\n- $ s = 5 $, $ b = 3 $\\n- $ a + c = 7 $, with $ 2 < a < 5 $\\n- Possible integer values: $ a = 3, c = 4 $ or $ a = 4, c = 3 $\\n- This gives triangle with sides $ 3, 3, 4 $, which satisfies all triangle inequalities and the area condition.\\n\\nHence, the **smallest possible perimeter** is $ p = 10 $, and the corresponding **semiperimeter** is $ s = 5 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\nNext, we compute $ s + 2305 = 5 + 2305 = 2310 $. We now determine how many positive integer factors $ n $ of 2310 have the property that the product of their positive divisors is a perfect square.\\n\\nLet $ n $ be a factor of 2310. Since 2310 is square-free ($ 2310 = 2 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 11 $), all its factors are also square-free. For any such $ n $, the number of positive divisors is $ d(n) = 2^k $, where $ k $ is the number of distinct prime factors of $ n $.\\n\\nThe product of the positive divisors of $ n $ is:\\n$$\\np(n) = n^{d(n)/2}\\n$$\\nThis is a perfect square if and only if $ d(n)/2 $ is even, i.e., $ d(n) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod 4 $, or $ n = 1 $ (which has $ d(n) = 1 $, and the product is 1, a perfect square).\\n\\nFor $ n = 1 $: $ d(n) = 1 $, product = 1 → perfect square ✅\\n\\nFor $ n $ with $ k $ prime factors:\\n- $ d(n) = 2^k $\\n- $ d(n)/2 = 2^{k-1} $\\n- $ p(n) $ is a perfect square iff $ 2^{k-1} $ is even ⇒ $ k \\\\geq 2 $\\n\\nSo, valid $ n $ are those with:\\n- $ k = 0 $ (i.e., $ n = 1 $)\\n- $ k \\\\geq 2 $\\n\\nCounting these:\\n- $ k = 0 $: 1 factor (only $ n = 1 $)\\n- $ k = 2 $: $ \\\\binom{5}{2} = 10 $\\n- $ k = 3 $: $ \\\\binom{5}{3} = 10 $\\n- $ k = 4 $: $ \\\\binom{5}{4} = 5 $\\n- $ k = 5 $: $ \\\\binom{5}{5} = 1 $\\n\\nTotal: $ 1 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 27 $\", \"answer\": \"27\"}",
