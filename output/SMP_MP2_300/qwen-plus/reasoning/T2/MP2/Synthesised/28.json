  "math_problem": "Compute all ordered triples $(x, y, z)$ of real numbers satisfying the following system of equations: $$\\begin{aligned} x y+z & =40 \\\\\\\\ x z+y & =51 \\\\\\\\ x+y+z & =19 \\end{aligned}$$ Instead of computing all ordered triples of real numbers satisfying the system of equations, simply find $k = z + \\frac{17}{5}$, where $z$ is the third component in the solution corresponding to the smaller root for $x + 1$ among the roots of the quadratic equation derived from the system. There are 21 competitors with distinct skill levels numbered $1,2, \\ldots, 21$. They participate in a pingpong tournament as follows. First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill $k$. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the system of equations:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\nxy + z &= 40 \\\\\\\\\\nxz + y &= 51 \\\\\\\\\\nx + y + z &= 19\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nWe aim to find all ordered triples $(x, y, z)$ satisfying this system. From the third equation, we express $z = 19 - x - y$, and substitute into the first two equations:\\n\\n- From the first equation: $xy + (19 - x - y) = 40 \\\\Rightarrow xy - x - y = 21 \\\\Rightarrow (x - 1)(y - 1) = 22$\\n- From the second equation: $x(19 - x - y) + y = 51 \\\\Rightarrow 19x - x^2 - xy + y = 51$\\n\\nSubstituting $xy = 21 + x + y$ from the first into the second gives a cubic in $x$:  \\n$$\\nx^3 - 19x^2 + 90x - 72 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nFactoring yields roots $x = 1, 6, 12$. However, $x = 1$ leads to a contradiction with the third equation, so valid solutions are:\\n\\n- For $x = 6$: $y = \\\\frac{27}{5}, z = \\\\frac{38}{5}$\\n- For $x = 12$: $y = 3, z = 4$\\n\\nThe problem specifies that we consider the solution corresponding to the **smaller root for $x + 1$** among the roots of the quadratic derived from the system. The relevant quadratic is $x^2 - 18x + 72 = 0$, whose roots are $x = 6$ and $x = 12$. Thus, $x + 1 = 7$ is smaller than $x + 1 = 13$, so we take $x = 6$, which gives $z = \\\\frac{38}{5}$.\\n\\nNow compute:\\n$$\\nk = z + \\\\frac{17}{5} = \\\\frac{38}{5} + \\\\frac{17}{5} = \\\\frac{55}{5} = 11\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\nNext, we analyze the pingpong tournament involving 21 players with distinct skill levels $1$ through $21$. Alice has skill level $k = 11$. The tournament proceeds as follows:\\n\\n- One player is randomly chosen as \\\"active\\\".\\n- In each round, a random inactive player is selected to play against the current active player.\\n- The higher-skilled player wins and becomes (or remains) active; the loser is eliminated.\\n- This continues for 20 rounds until one player remains.\\n\\nThis process is equivalent to a random permutation of the 21 players, where the first element is the initial active player, and the rest represent the order in which inactive players are chosen.\\n\\nLet:\\n- $l = 10$: number of players with skill less than 11 (skills 1–10)\\n- $m = 10$: number of players with skill greater than 11 (skills 12–21)\\n- $n = 21$: total number of players\\n\\nThe expected number of games Alice plays can be computed using the formula derived from probabilistic analysis of such tournaments:\\n\\n$$\\nE = \\\\frac{l + 1}{m + 1} + \\\\frac{m}{n}\\n$$\\n\\nSubstitute values:\\n\\n$$\\nE = \\\\frac{10 + 1}{10 + 1} + \\\\frac{10}{21} = 1 + \\\\frac{10}{21} = \\\\frac{31}{21}\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"31/21\"}",
