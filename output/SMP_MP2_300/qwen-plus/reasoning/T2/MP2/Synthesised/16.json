  "math_problem": "The numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 10$ are randomly arranged in a circle. Let $p$ be the probability that for every positive integer $k<10$, there exists an integer $k^{\\prime}>k$ such that there is at most one number between $k$ and $k^{\\prime}$ in the circle. If $p$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing one hundred times the numerator plus the denominator when the probability is expressed as a reduced fraction, simply find $k = p + \\frac{167}{90}$, where $p$ is the probability for the circular arrangement satisfying the given condition. Find all real solutions $(x, y)$ of the system $x^{k}+y=12=y^{k}+x$.",

Analysis shows that $ p = \\\\frac{13}{90} $, leading to $ k = \\\\frac{13}{90} + \\\\frac{167}{90} = 2 $. For $ k = 2 $, the system becomes $ x^2 + y = 12 $ and $ y^2 + x = 12 $. Solving symmetrically, $ x = y $ gives $ x^2 + x - 12 = 0 $, yielding solutions $ (3, 3) $ and $ (-4, -4) $.
