  "math_problem": "A committee of 5 is to be chosen from a group of 9 people. How many ways can it be chosen, if Bill and Karl must serve together or not at all, and Alice and Jane refuse to serve with each other? Instead of determining the total number of valid committee selections, simply find $k$, the number of valid committees when the must-serve-together pair is excluded and the refusing-to-serve-together pair is both included. An ant starts out at $(k, k)$. Each second, if it is currently at the square $(x, y)$, it can move to $(x-1, y-1),(x-1, y+1),(x+1, y-1)$, or $(x+1, y+1)$. In how many ways can it end up at $(2010,2010)$ after 4020 seconds?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine the value of $ k $, which is defined as the number of valid committees where:\\n\\n- Bill and Karl are **excluded** (i.e., neither is in the committee),\\n- Alice and Jane are **both included**.\\n\\nHowever, the constraint states that Alice and Jane **refuse to serve together**, meaning any committee containing both is **invalid**. Therefore, even though Bill and Karl are excluded (which satisfies their constraint), including both Alice and Jane violates the second constraint. Thus, there are **no valid committees** under these conditions, so:\\n\\n$$\\nk = 0\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\nNext, we analyze the ant's movement. The ant starts at position $ (k, k) = (0, 0) $, and each second it can move to one of four diagonal directions:\\n\\n- $ (x-1, y-1) $\\n- $ (x-1, y+1) $\\n- $ (x+1, y-1) $\\n- $ (x+1, y+1) $\\n\\nThis means that every move changes both coordinates by $ \\\\pm1 $, so after $ n $ moves, the total displacement in both $ x $ and $ y $ must be even if $ n $ is even.\\n\\nWe are asked to find the number of ways the ant can reach $ (2010, 2010) $ after **4020 seconds**.\\n\\nLet’s define:\\n- $ S_x = 2010 $: net displacement in $ x $-direction\\n- $ S_y = 2010 $: net displacement in $ y $-direction\\n- Total steps: $ N = 4020 $\\n\\nEach step contributes $ \\\\pm1 $ to both $ x $ and $ y $. To achieve a net displacement of $ +2010 $ in both directions, the number of $ +1 $ steps in $ x $ must be:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Number of } +x \\\\text{ steps} = \\\\frac{N + S_x}{2} = \\\\frac{4020 + 2010}{2} = 3015\\n$$\\n\\nSimilarly for $ y $:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Number of } +y \\\\text{ steps} = \\\\frac{4020 + 2010}{2} = 3015\\n$$\\n\\nThe number of ways to choose 3015 $ +x $ steps out of 4020 is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\binom{4020}{3015}\\n$$\\n\\nSince the choices for $ x $ and $ y $ directions are independent (each move independently chooses $ x $ and $ y $ direction), the total number of paths is the product of the number of ways to choose the $ x $-directions and the $ y $-directions:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left( \\\\binom{4020}{3015} \\\\right)^2\\n$$\\n\\nUsing the identity $ \\\\binom{n}{k} = \\\\binom{n}{n-k} $, we have:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\binom{4020}{3015} = \\\\binom{4020}{1005}\\n$$\\n\\nThus, the total number of valid paths is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left( \\\\binom{4020}{1005} \\\\right)^2\\n$$\",\n    \"answer\": \"4020 choose 1005 squared\"\n}",
