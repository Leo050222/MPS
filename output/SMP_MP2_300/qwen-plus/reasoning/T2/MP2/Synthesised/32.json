  "math_problem": "On a blackboard a stranger writes the values of $s_{7}(n)^{2}$ for $n=0,1, \\ldots, 7^{20}-1$, where $s_{7}(n)$ denotes the sum of digits of $n$ in base 7 . Compute the average value of all the numbers on the board. Instead of computing the average of the squares of the digit sums, simply find $m = \\mathrm{Var}(S) - 65$, where $S$ is the sum of digits in base 7 of a uniformly random $n$ from $0$ to $7^{20}-1$. The number 3003 is the only number known to appear eight times in Pascal's triangle, at positions $\\binom{3003}{1},\\binom{3003}{3002},\\binom{a}{2},\\binom{a}{a-2},\\binom{m}{b},\\binom{m}{m-b},\\binom{14}{6},\\binom{14}{8}$. Compute $a+b(m-b)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first compute $ m = \\\\mathrm{Var}(S) - 65 $, where $ S $ is the sum of digits in base 7 for a uniformly random $ n \\\\in [0, 7^{20} - 1] $. Each digit in base 7 (from 0 to 6) is independent and uniformly distributed. The expected value of a single digit is $ \\\\mathbb{E}[d_i] = \\\\frac{0+1+2+3+4+5+6}{7} = 3 $, and the variance of a single digit is $ \\\\mathrm{Var}(d_i) = \\\\mathbb{E}[d_i^2] - (\\\\mathbb{E}[d_i])^2 = \\\\frac{91}{7} - 9 = 13 - 9 = 4 $. For 20 digits, $ \\\\mathrm{Var}(S) = 20 \\\\times 4 = 80 $, so $ m = 80 - 65 = 15 $.\\n\\nNext, we analyze the Pascal's triangle positions where 3003 appears. Known positions include:\\n- $ \\\\binom{3003}{1}, \\\\binom{3003}{3002} $ (trivial),\\n- $ \\\\binom{14}{6}, \\\\binom{14}{8} $ (since $ \\\\binom{14}{6} = 3003 $),\\n- $ \\\\binom{a}{2}, \\\\binom{a}{a-2} $: solving $ \\\\frac{a(a-1)}{2} = 3003 $ gives $ a = 78 $,\\n- $ \\\\binom{m}{b}, \\\\binom{m}{m-b} $: with $ m = 15 $, $ \\\\binom{15}{5} = 3003 $, so $ b = 5 $.\\n\\nFinally, compute $ a + b(m - b) = 78 + 5(15 - 5) = 78 + 50 = 128 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"128\"\n}",
