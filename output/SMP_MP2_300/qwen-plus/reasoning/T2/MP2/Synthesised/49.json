  "math_problem": "A candy company makes 5 colors of jellybeans, which come in equal proportions. If I grab a random sample of 5 jellybeans, what is the probability that I get exactly 2 distinct colors? Instead of determining the probability of obtaining exactly two distinct colors in the sample, simply find $k = \\binom{5}{2} + 80$, where $\\binom{5}{2}$ is the number of ways to choose the two distinct colors from the five available. Triangle $\\triangle A B C$ has $A B=21, B C=55$, and $C A=56$. There are two points $P$ in the plane of $\\triangle A B C$ for which $\\angle B A P=\\angle C A P$ and $\\angle B P C=k^{\\circ}$. Find the distance between them.",
