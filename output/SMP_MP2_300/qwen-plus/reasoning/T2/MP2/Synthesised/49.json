  "math_problem": "A candy company makes 5 colors of jellybeans, which come in equal proportions. If I grab a random sample of 5 jellybeans, what is the probability that I get exactly 2 distinct colors? Instead of determining the probability of obtaining exactly two distinct colors in the sample, simply find $k = \\binom{5}{2} + 80$, where $\\binom{5}{2}$ is the number of ways to choose the two distinct colors from the five available. Triangle $\\triangle A B C$ has $A B=21, B C=55$, and $C A=56$. There are two points $P$ in the plane of $\\triangle A B C$ for which $\\angle B A P=\\angle C A P$ and $\\angle B P C=k^{\\circ}$. Find the distance between them.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute k = \\\\binom{5}{2} + 80. \\\\binom{5}{2} = 10, so k = 10 + 80 = 90. Next, consider triangle ABC with AB=21, BC=55, CA=56. Points P lie on the angle bisector of ∠BAC (since ∠BAP = ∠CAP) and satisfy ∠BPC = 90°. The locus of points P with ∠BPC = 90° is the circle with diameter BC (Thales' theorem). The distance between the two intersection points of the angle bisector with this circle is the chord length. \\n\\nThe circle has radius R = 55/2. The distance d from the circle's center (midpoint of BC) to the angle bisector line is calculated using the formula for distance from a point to a line. Coordinates of B and C are determined, and the angle bisector direction is found. The distance d = 25√3/4. Using the chord length formula 2√(R² - d²), we compute:\\n\\nR² - d² = (55/2)² - (25√3/4)² = 3025/4 - 1875/16 = 10225/16.\\n\\nThus, the chord length is 2√(10225/16) = √10225/2 = 5√409/2 (since 10225 = 25×409 and 409 is prime).\",\n    \"answer\": \"5√409/2\"\n}",
