  "math_problem": "$a$ and $b$ are integers such that $a+\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{15+\\sqrt{216}}$. Compute $a / b$. Instead of computing the ratio of the integer coefficient to the radicand in the denested form of the nested radical, simply find $k = a + 3$, where $a$ is the integer coefficient in that denested form. Mark has a cursed $k$-sided die that never rolls the same number twice in a row, and all other outcomes are equally likely. Compute the expected number of rolls it takes for Mark to roll every number at least once.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, denest the radical $\\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}}$. Assume $\\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}} = \\\\sqrt{x} + \\\\sqrt{y}$. Squaring both sides gives $15 + \\\\sqrt{216} = x + y + 2\\\\sqrt{xy}$. Equating rational and irrational parts: $x + y = 15$ and $2\\\\sqrt{xy} = \\\\sqrt{216}$. Solving $\\\\sqrt{216} = 6\\\\sqrt{6}$, so $\\\\sqrt{xy} = 3\\\\sqrt{6}$, hence $xy = 54$. Solving $x + y = 15$ and $xy = 54$ gives $x = 9$, $y = 6$ (or vice versa). Thus, $\\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}} = 3 + \\\\sqrt{6}$, so $a = 3$ and $b = 6$. Then $k = a + 3 = 6$.\\n\\nNext, compute the expected number of rolls for a 6-sided die that never repeats the same number consecutively to collect all numbers. This is a modified coupon collector problem. For $k$ sides, the expected number of rolls is $1 + (k-1) \\\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \\\\frac{1}{i}$. For $k = 6$, the harmonic number $H_5 = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{5} = \\\\frac{137}{60}$. Thus, the expected rolls are $1 + 5 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{137}{60} = \\\\frac{149}{12}$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"149/12\"\n}",
