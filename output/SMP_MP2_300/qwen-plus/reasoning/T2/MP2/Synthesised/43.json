  "math_problem": "$a$ and $b$ are integers such that $a+\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{15+\\sqrt{216}}$. Compute $a / b$. Instead of computing the ratio of the integer coefficient to the radicand in the denested form of the nested radical, simply find $k = a + 3$, where $a$ is the integer coefficient in that denested form. Mark has a cursed $k$-sided die that never rolls the same number twice in a row, and all other outcomes are equally likely. Compute the expected number of rolls it takes for Mark to roll every number at least once.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, denest the radical $\\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}}$. Assume it equals $a + \\\\sqrt{b}$ with integers $a, b$. Squaring both sides gives $15 + \\\\sqrt{216} = a^2 + b + 2a\\\\sqrt{b}$. Equating rational and irrational parts: $a^2 + b = 15$ and $2a\\\\sqrt{b} = \\\\sqrt{216} = 6\\\\sqrt{6}$. Solving $2a\\\\sqrt{b} = 6\\\\sqrt{6}$ yields $a\\\\sqrt{b} = 3\\\\sqrt{6}$, so $a^2 b = 54$. With $a^2 + b = 15$, solving $x + y = 15$ and $xy = 54$ (where $x = a^2, y = b$) gives $x = 9, y = 6$. Thus $a = 3$, $b = 6$, so $k = a + 3 = 6$.\\n\\nNext, compute the expected number of rolls for a 6-sided die that never repeats consecutively to collect all numbers. Let $n = 6$. The expected time to collect all $n$ numbers is $1 + (n-1)H_{n-1}$, where $H_{n-1}$ is the $(n-1)$th harmonic number. Here, $H_5 = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{5} = \\\\frac{137}{60}$. Thus, the expected rolls are $1 + 5 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{137}{60} = \\\\frac{149}{12}$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"149/12\"\n}",
