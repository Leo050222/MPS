  "math_problem": "Ava and Tiffany participate in a knockout tournament consisting of a total of 32 players. In each of 5 rounds, the remaining players are paired uniformly at random. In each pair, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is knocked out of the tournament. The probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other during the tournament is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of evaluating the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator representing the probability that the two designated players meet during the tournament, simply find $b$, the denominator of that probability when expressed as a reduced fraction. Let $p$ be a real number and $c \\neq 0$ an integer such that $c-0.1<x^{p}\\left(\\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}}\\right)<c+0.1$ for all (positive) real numbers $x$ with $(b-16)<x<10^{-100}$. Find the ordered pair $(p, c)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the probability that Ava and Tiffany meet during a knockout tournament with 32 players.\\n\\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Tournament Structure**\\n\\n- The tournament has $ N = 32 $ players.\\n- It is a **knockout** format, meaning each round eliminates half the players until one remains.\\n- There are $ \\\\log_2(32) = 5 $ rounds.\\n- In each round, the remaining players are paired **uniformly at random**, and each match results in one winner advancing.\\n\\nWe are to compute the probability that **Ava and Tiffany play each other at some point** during the tournament.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Step 2: Key Insight Using Symmetry**\\n\\nLet’s consider all possible pairs of players. Since there are $ \\\\binom{32}{2} = 496 $ such pairs, and exactly $ 31 $ matches occur in the tournament (since $ 32 - 1 = 31 $), the total number of matches is fixed.\\n\\nBy symmetry, every pair of players has an equal chance of being matched against each other in the tournament. Therefore, the expected number of times any specific pair (e.g., Ava and Tiffany) plays is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Expected number of matches between Ava and Tiffany} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Total matches}}{\\\\text{Total possible pairs}} = \\\\frac{31}{496}\\n$$\\n\\nHowever, since they can only meet **at most once**, this expectation equals the **probability** that they meet:\\n\\n$$\\nP(\\\\text{Ava and Tiffany meet}) = \\\\frac{31}{496} = \\\\frac{1}{16}\\n$$\\n\\nThis simplifies to $ \\\\frac{a}{b} = \\\\frac{1}{16} $, where $ a = 1 $, $ b = 16 $, and $ \\\\gcd(a, b) = 1 $.\\n\\nThus, the denominator $ b = 16 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Step 3: Analyzing the Second Part of the Problem**\\n\\nWe are given:\\n\\n$$\\nc - 0.1 < x^p \\\\left( \\\\frac{1 - (1 + x)^{10}}{1 + (1 + x)^{10}} \\\\right) < c + 0.1 \\\\quad \\\\text{for all } 0 < x < 10^{-100}\\n$$\\n\\nGiven $ b = 16 $, the condition becomes $ 0 < x < 10^{-100} $, i.e., $ x \\\\to 0^+ $.\\n\\nWe analyze the behavior of the expression as $ x \\\\to 0^+ $.\\n\\n#### **Step 3.1: Expand $ (1 + x)^{10} $ for small $ x $**\\n\\nUsing the binomial expansion:\\n\\n$$\\n(1 + x)^{10} = 1 + 10x + \\\\mathcal{O}(x^2)\\n$$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n1 - (1 + x)^{10} = -10x + \\\\mathcal{O}(x^2)\\n$$\\n$$\\n1 + (1 + x)^{10} = 2 + 10x + \\\\mathcal{O}(x^2)\\n$$\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1 - (1 + x)^{10}}{1 + (1 + x)^{10}} = \\\\frac{-10x + \\\\mathcal{O}(x^2)}{2 + 10x + \\\\mathcal{O}(x^2)} \\\\approx \\\\frac{-10x}{2} = -5x\\n$$\\n\\nNow multiply by $ x^p $:\\n\\n$$\\nx^p \\\\cdot (-5x) = -5x^{p+1}\\n$$\\n\\nFor this expression to be approximately constant (i.e., within $ \\\\pm 0.1 $ of an integer $ c $) as $ x \\\\to 0^+ $, the exponent must be zero:\\n\\n$$\\np + 1 = 0 \\\\Rightarrow p = -1\\n$$\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$$\\nx^{-1} \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac{1 - (1 + x)^{10}}{1 + (1 + x)^{10}} \\\\right) \\\\approx -5\\n$$\\n\\nSo the limit is $ -5 $, and for sufficiently small $ x $, the expression lies in $ (-5.1, -4.9) $, which satisfies the inequality with $ c = -5 $.\\n\\nSince $ c \\\\neq 0 $, and it's an integer, this is valid.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Final Answer**\\n\\nThe ordered pair is $ (p, c) = (-1, -5) $.\", \"answer\": \"(-1, -5)\"}",
