  "math_problem": "Ava and Tiffany participate in a knockout tournament consisting of a total of 32 players. In each of 5 rounds, the remaining players are paired uniformly at random. In each pair, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is knocked out of the tournament. The probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other during the tournament is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of evaluating the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator representing the probability that the two designated players meet during the tournament, simply find $b$, the denominator of that probability when expressed as a reduced fraction. Let $p$ be a real number and $c \\neq 0$ an integer such that $c-0.1<x^{p}\\left(\\frac{1-(1+x)^{10}}{1+(1+x)^{10}}\\right)<c+0.1$ for all (positive) real numbers $x$ with $(b-16)<x<10^{-100}$. Find the ordered pair $(p, c)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the probability that Ava and Tiffany meet during a knockout tournament with 32 players.\\n\\n### Step 1: Understanding the Tournament Structure\\n\\n- The tournament has $ n = 32 = 2^5 $ players.\\n- In each round, the remaining players are paired uniformly at random.\\n- Each match eliminates one player, so there are $ n - 1 = 31 $ matches in total.\\n- The key is to compute the probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other at some point in the tournament.\\n\\n### Step 2: Probability That Two Specific Players Meet\\n\\nLet’s denote the probability that two specific players (say Ava and Tiffany) meet as $ p $. A powerful symmetry argument simplifies this:\\n\\n- There are $ \\\\binom{32}{2} = 496 $ possible unordered pairs of players.\\n- Exactly 31 matches occur in the tournament, each involving a unique pair of players.\\n- By symmetry, all pairs are equally likely to be among these 31 matches.\\n\\nThus, the expected number of matches involving any specific pair is:\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Expected number of matches for a specific pair} = \\\\frac{31}{\\\\binom{32}{2}} = \\\\frac{31}{496} = \\\\frac{1}{16}\\n$$\\n\\nSo, the probability that Ava and Tiffany meet is $ \\\\frac{1}{16} $, which is already in lowest terms. Therefore, $ a = 1 $, $ b = 16 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Second Part of the Problem\\n\\nWe are given:\\n$$\\nc - 0.1 < x^p \\\\left( \\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{1 + (1+x)^{10}} \\\\right) < c + 0.1\\n$$\\nfor all positive real numbers $ x $ such that $ (b - 16) < x < 10^{-100} $, where $ b = 16 $.\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n$$\\n0 < x < 10^{-100}\\n$$\\n\\nWe analyze the expression:\\n$$\\nE(x) = x^p \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{1 + (1+x)^{10}} \\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\n#### Step 3.1: Taylor Expansion for Small $ x $\\n\\nFor small $ x $, expand $ (1+x)^{10} $ using the binomial theorem:\\n$$\\n(1+x)^{10} \\\\approx 1 + 10x + \\\\cdots\\n$$\\nThen:\\n$$\\n1 - (1+x)^{10} \\\\approx -10x, \\\\quad 1 + (1+x)^{10} \\\\approx 2\\n$$\\nSo:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{1 + (1+x)^{10}} \\\\approx \\\\frac{-10x}{2} = -5x\\n$$\\n\\nTherefore:\\n$$\\nE(x) \\\\approx x^p \\\\cdot (-5x) = -5x^{p+1}\\n$$\\n\\n#### Step 3.2: Determine $ p $ and $ c $\\n\\nWe want $ E(x) $ to be approximately constant for very small $ x $. This happens only if the exponent of $ x $ is zero:\\n$$\\np + 1 = 0 \\\\Rightarrow p = -1\\n$$\\n\\nWith $ p = -1 $, we get:\\n$$\\nE(x) \\\\approx -5x^0 = -5\\n$$\\n\\nAs $ x \\\\to 0^+ $, the higher-order terms vanish, and $ E(x) \\\\to -5 $. Since $ x < 10^{-100} $, the deviation from $ -5 $ is negligible (less than $ 0.1 $), satisfying the inequality:\\n$$\\n-5.1 < E(x) < -4.9\\n$$\\n\\nThus, $ c = -5 $, and the ordered pair is $ (p, c) = (-1, -5) $.\", \"answer\": \"(-1, -5)\"}",
