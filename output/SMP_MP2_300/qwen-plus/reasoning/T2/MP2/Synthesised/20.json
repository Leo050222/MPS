  "math_problem": "Wendy eats sushi for lunch. She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, labeled as follows:\n\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} A & B & C \\\\ D & E & F \\\\ \\end{array}$\n\nwhere pieces are adjacent if they share a side (not counting diagonally), with adjacencies $A$-$B$, $A$-$D$, $B$-$C$, $B$-$E$, $C$-$F$, $D$-$E$, $E$-$F$. The pieces of sushi are distinguishable. She can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other remaining pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row. Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers randomly (and independently) chosen from the range $[0,1]$. Find the probability that $a$, $b$ and $k$ form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ k $. The grid is:\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{ccc}\\nA & B & C \\\\\\\\\\nD & E & F \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{array}\\n$$\\nThe two endpoint pieces of the top row are $ A $ and $ C $. After eating $ A $ and $ C $, the remaining pieces are $ B, D, E, F $. The induced subgraph on these nodes has edges:\\n- $ B $-$ E $ (from original $ B $-$ E $),\\n- $ D $-$ E $ (from original $ D $-$ E $),\\n- $ E $-$ F $ (from original $ E $-$ F $).\\nThus, $ F $ is only adjacent to $ E $, so $ \\\\deg(F) = 1 $. Hence, $ k = \\\\deg(F) + 0 = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, find the probability that $ a, b, k = 1 $ form an obtuse triangle. For $ a, b \\\\in [0,1] $, the triangle inequalities require $ a + b > 1 $ (since $ 1 $ is the longest side). The triangle is obtuse if $ 1^2 > a^2 + b^2 $ (angle opposite $ 1 $ is obtuse). The valid region is where $ a + b > 1 $ and $ a^2 + b^2 < 1 $ within the unit square.\\n\\nThe area of this region is the area of the circular segment of the unit circle in the first quadrant above the line $ a + b = 1 $. The quarter-circle area is $ \\\\pi/4 $, and the triangular area under $ a + b = 1 $ is $ 1/2 $. Thus, the segment area is $ \\\\pi/4 - 1/2 = (\\\\pi - 2)/4 $, which is the probability.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(\\\\pi - 2)/4\"\n}",
