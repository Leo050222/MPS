  "math_problem": "Wendy eats sushi for lunch. She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, labeled as follows:\n\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} A & B & C \\\\ D & E & F \\\\ \\end{array}$\n\nwhere pieces are adjacent if they share a side (not counting diagonally), with adjacencies $A$-$B$, $A$-$D$, $B$-$C$, $B$-$E$, $C$-$F$, $D$-$E$, $E$-$F$. The pieces of sushi are distinguishable. She can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other remaining pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row. Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers randomly (and independently) chosen from the range $[0,1]$. Find the probability that $a$, $b$ and $k$ form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ k $. The top row endpoints are $ A $ and $ C $; eating them leaves $ B, D, E, F $. The induced subgraph has edges $ B-E $, $ D-E $, $ E-F $. Thus, $ F $ has degree 1, so $ k = 1 $. \\n\\nNext, find the probability that $ a, b, 1 $ form an obtuse triangle. For $ a, b \\\\in [0,1] $, the triangle is valid if $ a + b > 1 $ (other inequalities hold automatically). It is obtuse if $ 1^2 > a^2 + b^2 $ (since 1 is the longest side). The region satisfying both conditions is the area inside the unit circle quadrant ($ a^2 + b^2 < 1 $) and above $ a + b = 1 $. This area is $ \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi - 2}{4} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(\\\\pi - 2)/4\"\n}",
