  "math_problem": "After walking so much that his feet get really tired, the beaver staggers so that, at each step, his coordinates change by either (+1,+1) or (+1,-1). Now he walks from (0,0) to (8,0) without ever going below the x-axis. How many such paths are there? Instead of counting the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,0) that never go below the x-axis, simply find $k = m - 49$, where $m$ is the number of lattice paths from (0,-2) to (8,0) using steps of (+1,+1) or (+1,-1) derived from the reflection principle to count paths that violate the non-negativity condition. How many multiples of $k$ between $10^{6}$ and $10^{9}$ are perfect squares?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ m $, the number of lattice paths from (0,-2) to (8,0) using steps (+1,+1) or (+1,-1). Each path consists of 8 steps. Let $ u $ be up steps and $ d $ be down steps. Solving $ u + d = 8 $ and $ u - d = 2 $ (since the y-coordinate changes from -2 to 0), we get $ u = 5 $, $ d = 3 $. Thus, $ m = \\\\binom{8}{5} = 56 $. Then $ k = m - 49 = 56 - 49 = 7 $.\\n\\nNext, find the number of perfect squares that are multiples of $ k = 7 $ between $ 10^6 $ and $ 10^9 $. A perfect square multiple of 7 must be of the form $ 49t^2 $ (since 7 divides the square, 7 must divide the root, so $ s = 7t $). Solve $ 10^6 \\\\leq 49t^2 \\\\leq 10^9 $:\\n- Lower bound: $ t \\\\geq \\\\sqrt{10^6 / 49} \\\\approx 142.857 \\\\Rightarrow t \\\\geq 143 $\\n- Upper bound: $ t \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{10^9 / 49} \\\\approx 4517.54 \\\\Rightarrow t \\\\leq 4517 $\\n\\nThe number of integers $ t $ from 143 to 4517 inclusive is $ 4517 - 143 + 1 = 4375 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4375\"\n}",
