  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Instead of determining the number of partitions of the set into pairs that form a single cell, simply find $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game. What is the probability that exactly $k$ games will need to be played to determine a winner?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the value of $ k $. A consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell requires the set $ A $ to be partitioned into exactly one pair. This implies $ A $ has $ n = 2 $ elements (since a single pair contains 2 elements). Thus, $ k = n + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7 $.\\n\\nNext, calculate the probability that exactly $ k = 7 $ games are needed in a best-of-9 series where the first team to 5 wins takes the series. For the series to end in exactly 7 games, one team must win the 7th game and have exactly 4 wins in the first 6 games.\\n\\n- **Mathletes win in 7 games**: They win 4 of the first 6 games and the 7th game.
