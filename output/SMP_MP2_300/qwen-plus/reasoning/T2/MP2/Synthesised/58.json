  "math_problem": "Let $A B C$ be an isosceles triangle with apex $A$. Let $I$ be the incenter. If $A I=3$ and the distance from $I$ to $B C$ is 2 , then what is the length of $B C$ ? Instead of determining the length of the base $BC$, simply find $d = AY - 4$, where $AY$ is the length of the segment from $A$ to $Y$ along the angle bisector, and $Y$ is the point of tangency of the incircle with $BC$. Find an $n$ such that $n! + (-d)(n-1)! + (-d)^2 (n-2)! + (-d)^3 (n-3)! + \\cdots + (-d)^{n-1} \\cdot 1!$ is prime. Be prepared to justify your answer for $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}n, \\\\\\\\ \\left[\\frac{n+225}{10}\\right],\\\\ \\end{array} n \\leq 25\\right.$ points, where $[N]$ is the greatest integer less than $N$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, consider the isosceles triangle $ABC$ with apex $A$. The incenter $I$ lies on the angle bisector of $\\\\angle A$, which is also the altitude and median to $BC$. Given $AI = 3$ and the distance from $I$ to $BC$ (the inradius $r$) is 2, the total height from $A$ to $BC$ is $AI + r = 3 + 2 = 5$. The point $Y$ is the tangency point of the incircle with $BC$, so $AY$ is the length from $A$ to $Y$ along the angle bisector. Since $I$ lies between $A$ and $Y$, $AY = AI + IY = 3 + 2 = 5$. Thus, $d = AY - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1$.\\n\\nNext, evaluate the expression for $n \\\\leq 25$:\\n$$\\nn! + (-d)(n-1)! + (-d)^2(n-2)! + \\\\cdots + (-d)^{n-1} \\\\cdot 1!\\n$$\\nWith $d = 1$, this becomes:\\n$$\\nn! - (n-1)! + (n-2)! - \\\\cdots + (-1)^{n-1} \\\\cdot 1!\\n$$\\nTesting small values of $n$:\\n- $n = 1$: $1! = 1$ (not prime)\\n- $n = 2$: $2! - 1! = 1$ (not prime)\\n- $n = 3$: $3! - 2! + 1! = 6 - 2 + 1 = 5$ (prime)\\n\\nSince $n = 3$ satisfies the condition and $n \\\\leq 25$, it is the solution.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
