  "math_problem": "A rubber band is 4 inches long. An ant begins at the left end. Every minute, the ant walks one inch along rightwards along the rubber band, but then the band is stretched (uniformly) by one inch. For what value of $n$ will the ant reach the right end during the $n$th minute? Instead of determining the minute during which the ant reaches the right end, simply find $p$, where $p$ is the portion of the rubber band's length traversed by the ant during the first minute accounting for the uniform stretch. Let $s = p + \\frac{23}{4}$. $s$ students taking a test sit in a row of seats with aisles only on the two sides of the row. If they finish the test at random times, what is the probability that some student will have to pass by another student to get to an aisle?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding the probability that some student must pass another to reach an aisle, given $ s = 6 $ students. First, $ p $ is determined as the portion of the rubber band traversed during the first minute. The ant walks 1 inch on a 4-inch band, so $ p = \\\\frac{1}{4} $. Then $ s = p + \\\\frac{23}{4} = \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{23}{4} = 6 $. For $ s = 6 $ students, the number of permutations where no student has to pass anyone is $ 2^{s-1} = 32 $. Total permutations are $ 6! = 720 $. The probability that some student must pass another is $ 1 - \\\\frac{32}{720} = \\\\frac{43}{45} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"43/45\"\n}",
