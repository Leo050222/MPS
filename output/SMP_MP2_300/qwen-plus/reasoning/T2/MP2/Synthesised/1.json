  "math_problem": "A jar contains 8 red balls and 2 blue balls. Every minute, a ball is randomly removed. The probability that there exists a time during this process where there are more blue balls than red balls in the jar can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime integers $a$ and $b$. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing 100 times the numerator plus the denominator of the probability expressed in lowest terms, simply find $n$ equal to the greatest common divisor of that numerator and denominator plus 2004. The L shape made by adjoining three congruent squares can be subdivided into four smaller L shapes. Each of these can in turn be subdivided, and so forth. If we perform $n$ successive subdivisions, how many of the $4^{n}$ L's left at the end will be in the same orientation as the original one?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two parts. First, we determine the probability that during the removal of balls from a jar with 8 red and 2 blue balls, there exists a time when blue balls exceed red balls. Using combinatorial analysis and the reflection principle, we find the number of violating paths (where blue > red at some point) is 10 out of 45 total paths. This simplifies to a probability of 2/9, with gcd(2,9)=1. Thus, n = 1 + 2004 = 2005.\\n\\nFor the second part, we analyze the subdivision of an L-shape. Each subdivision of an L-shape produces 4 smaller L-shapes. Due to rotational symmetry, each L-shape (regardless of orientation) contributes exactly one L-shape in the original orientation when subdivided. Therefore, after n subdivisions, the number of L-shapes in the original orientation is 4^(n-1). For n=2005, this is 4^2004.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4^2004\"\n}",
