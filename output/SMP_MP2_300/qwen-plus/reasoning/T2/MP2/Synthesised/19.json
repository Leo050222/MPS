  "math_problem": "Suppose $a$ and $b$ be positive integers not exceeding 100 such that $$a b=\\left(\\frac{\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)}{\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)}\\right)^{2}$$ Compute the largest possible value of $a+b$. Instead of computing the maximum possible sum of two positive integers not exceeding 100 that satisfy the given equation relating their product to the square of the ratio of their least common multiple to their greatest common divisor, simply find $m = s - 77$, where $s$ is that maximum possible sum. Consider a $5 \\times 5$ grid of squares. Vladimir colors some of these squares red, such that for any two distinct rows, the number of columns in which both have a red square is at most $m$. What is the maximum number of squares he could have colored red?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem requires solving two parts. First, find the largest possible sum $ s = a + b $ for positive integers $ a, b \\\\leq 100 $ satisfying $ ab = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)}{\\\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)} \\\\right)^2 $. Then compute $ m = s - 77 $, and use $ m $ to determine the maximum number of red squares in a $ 5 \\\\times 5 $ grid under specific constraints.\\n\\n**Step 1: Solve for $ a $ and $ b $**\\n\\nLet $ d = \\\\gcd(a, b) $, so $ a = dx $, $ b = dy $ with $ \\\\gcd(x, y) = 1 $. The equation becomes:\\n$$\\nabla^2 xy = (xy)^2 \\\\implies d^2 = xy.\\n$$\\nSince $ \\\\gcd(x, y) = 1 $, $ x $ and $ y $ must be perfect squares. Let $ x = m^2 $, $ y = n^2 $, so $ d = mn $. Thus:\\n$$\\na = m^3 n, \\\\quad b = m n^3, \\\\quad \\\\text{with } \\\\gcd(m, n) = 1.\\n$$\\nWe need $ a, b \\\\leq 100 $. Testing valid $ (m, n) $ pairs:\\n- $ (1, 4) $: $ a = 4, b = 64 $, sum $ 68 $\\n- $ (2, 3) $: $ a = 24, b = 54 $, sum $ 78 $\\n- Other pairs yield smaller sums or invalid values.\\n\\nThe maximum sum $ s = 78 $.\\n\\n**Step 2: Compute $ m = s - 77 $**\\n$$\\nm = 78 - 77 = 1.\\n$$\\n\\n**Step 3: Grid Coloring Problem**\\n\\nWe need to maximize red squares in a $ 5 \\\\times 5 $ grid such that any two distinct rows share at most $ m = 1 $ red column. This is equivalent to finding a binary matrix with row vectors where pairwise dot products $ \\\\leq 1 $.\\n\\nUsing combinatorial bounds:\\n- Let $ R $ be the total red squares. The sum of pairwise intersections $ \\\\leq \\\\binom{5}{2} \\\\cdot 1 = 10 $.\\n- By Cauchy-Schwarz, $ \\\\sum \\\\binom{s_k}{2} \\\\leq 10 $, where $ s_k $ is the number of red squares in column $ k $.\\n- Solving $ R^2 - 5R - 100 \\\\leq 0 $ gives $ R \\\\leq 12.8 $, so $ R \\\\leq 12 $.\\n\\nConstructing a valid matrix:\\n- Rows: [1,1,0,0,0], [1,0,1,0,0], [1,0,0,1,0], [1,0,0,0,1], [0,1,1,1,1]\\n- Pairwise intersections are exactly 1, satisfying the constraint.\\n- Total red squares: $ 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 12 $.\\n\\nNo configuration with $ R = 13 $ is possible due to the intersection bound.\", \"answer\": \"12\"}",
