  "math_problem": "You are given a $10 \\times 2$ grid of unit squares. Two different squares are adjacent if they share a side. How many ways can one mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent? Instead of counting the total number of ways to mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent, simply find $w$, where $w$ is the number of ways to mark one square in each of nine consecutive rows such that no two marked squares in adjacent rows share the same column. Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are positive integers with $m<n$ such that the interval $[m, n)$ contains more multiples of $(w + 2019)$ than multiples of 2000. Compute the maximum possible value of $n-m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine the value of $ w $, which represents the number of ways to mark one square in each of nine consecutive rows such that no two marked squares in adjacent rows share the same column. In a $ 2 $-column grid, this is equivalent to choosing a sequence of column choices (1 or 2) for nine rows where no two consecutive choices are the same. This is a classic alternating sequence problem: there are exactly two valid sequences (starting with column 1 or column 2), so $ w = 2 $.\\n\\nNext, we compute $ w + 2019 = 2 + 2019 = 2021 $. The problem now reduces to finding the maximum possible value of $ n - m $ such that the interval $[m, n)$ contains more multiples of 2021 than multiples of 2000.\\n\\nLet $ A = 2000 $ and $ B = 2021 $. We need the number of multiples of $ B $ in $[m, n)$ to exceed the number of multiples of $ A $. The key insight is that the density of multiples of $ B $ is lower than that of $ A $, so such intervals must be carefully positioned to capture more $ B $-multiples while avoiding $ A $-multiples.\\n\\nThe longest such interval occurs when the interval starts just after the first multiple of $ A $ (i.e., $ m = 2001 $) and ends just before the $ (t+1) $-th multiple of $ A $, where $ t $ is the largest integer such that $ t \\\\cdot B < (t+1) \\\\cdot A $. Solving $ 2021t < 2000(t+1) $ gives $ t < \\\\frac{2000}{21} \\\\approx 95.238 $, so $ t = 95 $.\\n\\nFor $ t = 95 $:\\n- The interval $[2001, 192000)$ contains $ 95 $ multiples of $ 2021 $ (from $ 2021 \\\\times 1 $ to $ 2021 \\\\times 95 $) and $ 94 $ multiples of $ 2000 $ (from $ 2000 \\\\times 2 $ to $ 2000 \\\\times 95 $).\\n- The length of this interval is $ 192000 - 2001 = 189999 $.\\n\\nNo longer interval satisfies the condition, as extending beyond $ 192000 $ would include an additional multiple of $ 2000 $, making the counts equal. Thus, the maximum $ n - m $ is $ 189999 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"189999\"\n}",
