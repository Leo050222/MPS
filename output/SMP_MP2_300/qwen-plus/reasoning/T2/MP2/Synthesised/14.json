  "math_problem": "Victoria wants to order at least 550 donuts from Dunkin' Donuts for the HMMT 2014 November contest. However, donuts only come in multiples of twelve. Assuming every twelve donuts cost $7.49, what is the minimum amount Victoria needs to pay, in dollars? Instead of computing the minimum cost to acquire at least the required number of units when purchases are constrained to multiples of the base quantity, simply find $e = \\left\\lfloor 550 / 12 \\right\\rfloor - 43$. There are two prime numbers $p$ so that $5 p$ can be expressed in the form $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n^{e}}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ for some positive integer $n$. What is the sum of these two prime numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute $ e = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{550}{12} \\\\right\\\\rfloor - 43 $. Since $ \\\\frac{550}{12} \\\\approx 45.833 $, $ \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{550}{12} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 45 $, so $ e = 45 - 43 = 2 $. Next, we need primes $ p $ such that $ 5p = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n^2}{5} \\\\right\\\\rfloor $ for some positive integer $ n $. This implies $ 25p \\\\leq n^2 < 25p + 5 $. Analyzing $ n^2 \\\\mod 5 $, valid residues are 0, 1, 4. Testing values, $ n = 24 $ gives $ \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{24^2}{5} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 115 = 5 \\\\times 23 $ (prime), and $ n = 27 $ gives $ \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{27^2}{5} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 145 = 5 \\\\times 29 $ (prime). No other primes satisfy the condition. The sum of these primes is $ 23 + 29 = 52 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"52\"\n}",
