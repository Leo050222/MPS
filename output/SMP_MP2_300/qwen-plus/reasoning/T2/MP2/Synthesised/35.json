  "math_problem": "The following image is 1024 pixels by 1024 pixels, and each pixel is either black or white. The border defines the boundaries of the image, but is not part of the image. Let $a$ be the proportion of pixels that are black. Estimate $A=\\lfloor 10000 a\\rfloor$. An estimate of $E$ will earn $\\left\\lfloor 20 \\min \\left(\\frac{A}{E}, \\frac{E}{A}\\right)^{12}\\right\\rfloor$ points. Instead of estimating the floored scaled proportion of black pixels, simply find $k = N - 1048572$, where $N$ is the total number of pixels. The game of rock-scissors is played just like rock-paper-scissors, except that neither player is allowed to play paper. You play against a poorly-designed computer program that plays rock with $50 \\%$ probability and scissors with $50 \\%$ probability. If you play optimally against the computer, find the probability that after 8 games you have won at least $k$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The image is 1024x1024 pixels, so total pixels N = 1024 * 1024 = 1,048,576. Then k = N - 1,048,572 = 4. In the rock-scissors game, the computer plays rock or scissors with 50% probability each. Optimal play is always choosing rock, giving a 50% chance to win each game (win when computer plays scissors). The number of wins in 8 games follows a binomial distribution with n=8 and p=0.5. The probability of at least 4 wins is the sum of probabilities for 4 to 8 wins. Calculating binomial coefficients: C(8,4)=70, C(8,5)=56, C(8,6)=28, C(8,7)=8, C(8,8)=1. Sum = 70+56+28+8+1=163. Total possible outcomes = 2^8=256. Thus, the probability is 163/256.\",\n    \"answer\": \"163/256\"\n}",
