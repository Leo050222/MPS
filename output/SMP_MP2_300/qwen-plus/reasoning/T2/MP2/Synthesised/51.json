  "math_problem": "For positive integers $n$, let $L(n)$ be the largest factor of $n$ other than $n$ itself. Determine the number of ordered pairs of composite positive integers $(m, n)$ for which $L(m) L(n)=80$. Instead of determining the number of ordered pairs of composite positive integers whose largest proper factors have product equal to the given integer, simply find $k = N(40) + 0$, where $N(d)$ is the number of primes less than or equal to the smallest prime factor of $d$. A square is inscribed in a circle of radius $k$. Find the perimeter of the square.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine k = N(40) + 0. The smallest prime factor of 40 is 2. The primes less than or equal to 2 are [2], so N(40) = 1. Thus, k = 1 + 0 = 1. A square inscribed in a circle of radius k has a diagonal equal to the circle's diameter (2k = 2). The side length s of the square satisfies s√2 = 2, so s = √2. The perimeter is 4s = 4√2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4√2\"\n}",
