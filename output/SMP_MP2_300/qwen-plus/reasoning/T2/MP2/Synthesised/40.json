Instead of determining the ordered triple, simply find $k = p - \\frac{1}{4}$, where $p$ is the value of the first variable in the solution to the given system of equations. Is there an integer $n$ such that $\\sqrt{n-k}+\\sqrt{n+k}$ is a rational number?",

Since $ n $ is an integer, $ n^2 - 1 $ must be a perfect square for $ \\\\sqrt{n^2 - 1} $ to be rational. Let $ m = \\\\sqrt{n^2 - 1} $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nn^2 - m^2 = 1 \\\\Rightarrow (n - m)(n + m) = 1\\n$$\\n\\nThe only integer solutions to this are $ n = \\\\pm 1 $, $ m = 0 $.
