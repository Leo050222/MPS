  "math_problem": "During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^{2}$. Instead of determining the real part of the square of the starting point, simply find $k = |z| - 1$, where $|z|$ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days. Bob's Rice ID number has six digits, each a number from 1 to 9, and any digit can be used any number of times. The ID number satisfies the following property: the first two digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 2, the first three digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 3, the first four digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 4, the first five digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 5, and the ID number itself is congruent to $k$ modulo 6. One ID number that satisfies this condition is 123252. How many different possibilities are there for Bob's ID number?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine $ k = |z| - 1 $ using the condition that the total path lengths on Saturday and Sunday are equal. The total distance traveled on Saturday is $ |z^2 - 1| \\\\cdot (r + r^3 + \\\\cdots + r^{2011}) $ and on Sunday is $ |z^2 - 1| \\\\cdot (1 + r^2 + \\\\cdots + r^{2010}) $, where $ r = |z| $. Setting these equal gives $ r = 1 $, so $ k = |z| - 1 = 0 $.\\n\\nNext, we count Bob's Rice ID numbers (6-digit, digits 1-9) satisfying:\\n- First two digits even (since $ k = 0 \\\\mod 2 $), so $ d_2 \\\\in \\\\{2,4,6,8\\\\} $ (4 choices).\\n- First three digits divisible by 3: $ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod 3 $. For fixed $ d_2, d_3 $, $ d_1 $ has 3 valid choices.\\n- First four digits divisible by 4: last two digits $ d_3d_4 $ must form a number divisible by 4. There are 18 valid $ (d_3, d_4) $ pairs.\\n- First five digits divisible by 5: $ d_5 = 5 $ (1 choice).\\n- Entire ID divisible by 6: $ d_6 $ even and sum of digits divisible by 3. Depending on $ d_4 \\\\mod 3 $, $ d_6 $ has 1 or 2 valid choices.\\n\\nGrouping the 18 $ (d_3, d_4) $ pairs by $ d_4 \\\\mod 3 $:\\n- $ d_4 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod 3 $ (5 pairs): $ d_6 $ must be 4 (1 choice).\\n- $ d_4 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 3 $ (4 pairs): $ d_6 $ must be 6 (1 choice).\\n- $ d_4 \\\\equiv 2 \\\\mod 3 $ (9 pairs): $ d_6 $ can be 2 or 8 (2 choices).\\n\\nTotal IDs: $ 5 \\\\cdot 4 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 1 + 4 \\\\cdot 4 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 1 + 9 \\\\cdot 4 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 2 = 60 + 48 + 216 = 324 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"324\"\n}",
