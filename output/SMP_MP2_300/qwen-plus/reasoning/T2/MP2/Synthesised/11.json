  "math_problem": "During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^{2}$. Instead of determining the real part of the square of the starting point, simply find $k = |z| - 1$, where $|z|$ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days. Bob's Rice ID number has six digits, each a number from 1 to 9, and any digit can be used any number of times. The ID number satisfies the following property: the first two digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 2, the first three digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 3, the first four digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 4, the first five digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 5, and the ID number itself is congruent to $k$ modulo 6. One ID number that satisfies this condition is 123252. How many different possibilities are there for Bob's ID number?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, analyze the complex plane problem. On Saturday, Eli travels from $z$ to $z^{2013}$ through odd exponents, and on Sunday from $1$ to $z^{2012}$ through even exponents. The total path lengths are both $\\\\sqrt{2012}$. Let $r = |z|$. The Saturday path length is $|z^2 - 1| \\\\cdot r \\\\cdot S$ and Sunday's is $|z^2 - 1| \\\\cdot S$, where $S = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{1005} r^{2k}$. Setting both equal to $\\\\sqrt{2012}$ gives $r = 1$, so $k = |z| - 1 = 0$.\\n\\nFor the Rice ID problem, $k = 0$ implies:\\n- First two digits even (d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8}, 4 choices).\\n- First three digits sum to 0 mod 3 (d3 has 3 choices per d1,d2).\\n- First four digits divisible by 4 (d4 has 2 choices per d3, but combined with d6 constraints, 3 valid (d4,d6) pairs per d3).\\n- First five digits end with 5 (d5 = 5, 1 choice).\\n- Full ID divisible by 6 (d6 even and sum divisible by 3, satisfied by construction).\\n\\nTotal combinations: $9 \\\\text{ (d1)} \\\\times 4 \\\\text{ (d2)} \\\\times 3 \\\\text{ (d3)} \\\\times 3 \\\\text{ ((d4,d6))} \\\\times 1 \\\\text{ (d5)} = 324$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"324\"\n}",
