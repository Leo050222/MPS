  "math_problem": "Let $S(n)$ be the sum of the digits of the positive integer $n$. Find all $n$ such that $S(n)(S(n)-1)=n-1$. Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ satisfying the given condition, simply find $k = S(n) + 4$, where $n$ is the smallest such positive integer. Penta chooses $k$ of the vertices of a unit cube. What is the maximum possible volume of the figure whose vertices are the $k$ chosen points?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first find the smallest positive integer $ n $ such that $ S(n)(S(n) - 1) = n - 1 $, where $ S(n) $ is the sum of the digits of $ n $. Let $ s = S(n) $. The equation becomes $ s(s - 1) = n - 1 $, so $ n = s^2 - s + 1 $. We check small values of $ s $:\\n\\n- For $ s = 1 $: $ n = 1^2 - 1 + 1 = 1 $. $ S(1) = 1 $, and $ 1(1 - 1) = 0 = 1 - 1 $. This works.\\n- For $ s = 2 $: $ n = 3 $, but $ S(3) = 3 \\\\neq 2 $.\\n- For $ s = 3 $: $ n = 7 $, but $ S(7) = 7 \\\\neq 3 $.\\n- For $ s = 4 $: $ n = 13 $, $ S(13) = 4 $, which works, but $ n = 1 $ is smaller.\\n\\nThus, the smallest $ n $ is $ 1 $, so $ S(n) = 1 $. Then $ k = S(n) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 $.\\n\\nNext, we determine the maximum possible volume of a figure formed by choosing $ k = 5 $ vertices of a unit cube. A unit cube has 8 vertices. The maximum volume occurs when the convex hull of the 5 chosen vertices excludes the smallest possible volume. By analyzing configurations, the maximum volume is achieved when the excluded vertices form a corner (e.g., $ (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0) $), leaving the chosen vertices as $ (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1), (0,1,1) $. The volume of this convex hull is calculated via cross-section integration or tetrahedron decomposition, yielding $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/2\"\n}",
