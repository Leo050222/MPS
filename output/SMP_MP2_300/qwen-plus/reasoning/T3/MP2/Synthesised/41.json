  "math_problem": "In triangle $ABC, \\angle A=2 \\angle C$. Suppose that $AC=6, BC=8$, and $AB=\\sqrt{a}-b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the concatenated numerical value from the positive integers $a$ and $b$ defining the side length $AB$, simply find $k = b + 5$, where $b$ is the positive integer subtracted in the expression for $AB$. Let $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{k}$ be $k$ distinct points on a circle. Determine the number of possible configurations made by drawing a set of line segments connecting pairs of these $k$ points, such that: (1) each $P_{i}$ is the endpoint of at most one segment and (2) no two segments intersect. (The configuration with no edges drawn is allowed.)",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve triangle ABC where ∠A = 2∠C, AC = 6, BC = 8, and AB = √a - b. Using the Law of Sines: BC/sin(2θ) = AC/sin(3θ) = AB/sin(θ) (with θ = ∠C). Simplifying 8/(2 sinθ cosθ) = 6/sin(3θ) leads to 4/cosθ = 6/(4 cos²θ - 1), resulting in the quadratic 8x² - 3x - 2 = 0 (x = cosθ). Solving gives x = (3 + √73)/16. Then AB = 4/cosθ = √73 - 3, so a = 73, b = 3. Next, k = b + 5 = 8. The problem requires counting non-crossing matchings (each point in at most one segment, no intersections) on 8 circle points. This is the 8th Motzkin number, which is 323 (sequence A001006: M(0)=1, M(1)=1, M(2)=2, M(3)=4, M(4)=9, M(5)=21, M(6)=51, M(7)=127, M(8)=323).\",\n    \"answer\": \"323\"\n}",
