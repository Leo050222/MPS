Suppose $x^{3}-a x^{2}+b x-48$ is a polynomial with three positive roots $p, q$, and $r$ such that $p<q<r$. What is the minimum possible value of $k / p+2 / q+3 / r$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the Diophantine equation $m^5 - n^5 = 16mn$ for integer pairs $(m, n)$ with opposite signs. Assume $m < 0$ and $n > 0$, let $m = -k$ ($k > 0$), then the equation becomes $k^5 + n^5 = 16kn$. Testing small positive integers, $(k, n) = (2, 2)$ satisfies $2^5 + 2^5 = 64 = 16 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 2$, so $(m, n) = (-2, 2)$ is a solution. Here, $n = 2$ (positive), so $k = n - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nNext, consider the polynomial $x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48$ with positive roots $p < q < r$. By Vieta's formulas, $pqr = 48$. We need to minimize $\\\\frac{k}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r} = \\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$.\\n\\nUsing Lagrange multipliers with constraint $pqr = 48$, we find critical points where $q = 2p$ and $r = 3p$. Substituting into $pqr = 48$ gives $p \\\\cdot 2p \\\\cdot 3p = 6p^3 = 48 \\\\Rightarrow p = 2$, so $q = 4$, $r = 6$. This satisfies $p < q < r$ and yields $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{3}{2}$.\\n\\nVerification confirms this is the minimum, as boundary cases and other factorizations yield larger values.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3/2\"\n}",
