  "math_problem": "Let \\(P(x)\\) be a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients. Suppose that \\(P(1)=20, P(-1)=22\\), and \\(P(P(0))=400\\). Compute the largest possible value of \\(P(10)\\). Instead of finding the maximum possible evaluation of the quadratic at a designated point, simply find \\(k = b + 3\\), where \\(b\\) is the linear coefficient of the polynomial as determined by the given evaluation conditions. If $x, y$, and $z$ are real numbers such that $2 x^{k}+y^{k}+z^{2}=2 x-4 y+2 x z-5$, find the maximum possible value of $x-y+z$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, consider the quadratic polynomial $P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. Given $P(1) = 20$ and $P(-1) = 22$, we derive:\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{cases}\\na + b + c = 20 \\\\\\\\\\na - b + c = 22\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n$$\\nSubtracting these equations gives $2b = -2 \\\\implies b = -1$. Thus, $k = b + 3 = -1 + 3 = 2$.\\n\\nNext, using $P(P(0)) = 400$, note $P(0) = c$, so $P(c) = ac^2 + bc + c = 400$. Substituting $b = -1$ and $c = 21 - a$ (from $a + c = 21$), we solve $a(21 - a)^2 = 400$, yielding valid $a$ values $1, 16, 25$. However, $b$ is uniquely determined as $-1$, so $k = 2$ is fixed.\\n\\nFor the second part, substitute $k = 2$ into the equation $2x^k + y^k + z^2 = 2x - 4y + 2xz - 5$, resulting in:\\n$$\\n2x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2x + 4y - 2xz + 5 = 0\\n$$\\nCompleting the square:\\n$$\\n2\\\\left(x - \\\\frac{z+1}{2}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2}(z - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 0\\n$$\\nEach squared term must be zero, giving $x = 1$, $y = -2$, $z = 1$. Thus, $x - y + z = 1 - (-2) + 1 = 4$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4\"\n}",
