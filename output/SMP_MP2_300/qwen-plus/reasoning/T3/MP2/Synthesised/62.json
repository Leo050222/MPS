  "math_problem": "Let the function $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ take only integer inputs and have integer outputs. For any integers $x$ and $y$, $f$ satisfies $f(x)+f(y)=f(x+1)+f(y-1)$. If $f(2016)=6102$ and $f(6102)=2016$, what is $f(1)$? Instead of determining the value of the function at a specific input, simply find $h = k + 5$, where $k$ is the constant difference $f(z+1) - f(z)$ for all integers $z$ derived from the functional equation. Let $n$ be a positive integer. In how many ways can a $h \\times 4n$ grid be tiled with the following tetromino?\n[asy]\nsize(4cm);\ndraw((1,0)--(3,0)--(3,1)--(0,1)--(0,0)--(1,0)--(1,2)--(2,2)--(2,0));\n[/asy]",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The functional equation $f(x) + f(y) = f(x+1) + f(y-1)$ implies that the difference $f(z+1) - f(z)$ is constant for all integers $z$. Let $k = f(z+1) - f(z)$. Then $f$ is linear: $f(z) = kz + c$. Using $f(2016) = 6102$ and $f(6102) = 2016$, we solve:\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{cases}\\n2016k + c = 6102 \\\\\\\\\\n6102k + c = 2016\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n$$\\nSubtracting gives $4086k = -4086$, so $k = -1$. Thus, $h = k + 5 = 4$.\\n\\nNext, we analyze tiling a $4 \\\\times 4n$ grid with the given tetromino. The Asymptote code describes a T-tetromino (three squares in a row with one centered above). Using a 4-coloring argument where each cell $(i,j)$ is colored $(i \\\\mod 2, j \\\\mod 2)$, the T-tetromino covers 2 of one color, 1 of two others, and 0 of the fourth. In a $4 \\\\times 4n$ grid, all four color classes have size $4n$. However, solving the system of equations for color coverage shows no valid tiling exists (leads to a contradiction for positive $n$). Thus, the number of tilings is 0.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
