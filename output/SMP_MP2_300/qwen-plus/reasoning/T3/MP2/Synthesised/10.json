  "math_problem": "Let $f(x)=x^{2}-2$, and let $f^{n}$ denote the function $f$ applied $n$ times. Consider the sequence $(L_n)$ defined by $L_0 = 2$, $L_1 = 1$, and $L_{n+2} = L_{n+1} + L_n$ for $n \\geq 0$. Compute the remainder when $f^{24}(18)$ is divided by 89. Instead of determining the value modulo the given prime of the result of iterating the quadratic function the specified number of times starting from the given initial value, simply find $d = L_8 - 42$, where $L_8$ is the eighth term of the sequence $(L_n)$ defined in the problem. How many polynomials of degree exactly $d$ with real coefficients send the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ to a permutation of itself?",

A polynomial of degree exactly 5 that maps this set to a permutation must be the unique interpolating polynomial for that permutation. The degree is exactly 5 if and only if the 5th finite difference of the permutation is non-zero.\\n\\nFor a set of size $ n = 6 $, the number of permutations with 5th finite difference zero (i.e., polynomials of degree $ \\\\leq 4 $) is $ (n-1)! = 5! = 120 $. This is a known combinatorial result: for a set of size $ n $, the number of permutations that are polynomials of degree $ \\\\leq n-2 $ is $ (n-1)! $.\\n\\nThe total number of permutations of $ \\\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\\\} $ is $ 6! = 720 $.
