  "math_problem": "The altitudes of a triangle are $12$, $15$, and $20$.  What is the area of this triangle? Instead of finding the area of the triangle, simply find $k = x - 3$, where $x$ is the scaling factor such that the side lengths are $5x$ for the longest side, $4x$ for the middle-length side, and $3x$ for the shortest side. Find all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of complex numbers with $a^{k}+b^{k} \\neq 0$, $a+\\frac{10b}{a^{k}+b^{k}}=5$, and $b+\\frac{10a}{a^{k}+b^{k}}=4$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The altitudes of the triangle are 12, 15, and 20. Since the area of a triangle is (1/2)*base*height, the sides are inversely proportional to the altitudes. The ratios of the altitudes (12:15:20) correspond to side ratios 1/12 : 1/15 : 1/20 = 5:4:3. Thus, the sides are 5x (longest), 4x (middle), and 3x (shortest). Using the area formula for a right triangle (3-4-5 triangle), the area is (1/2)*3x*4x = 6x². Equating this to the area via the longest side's altitude: (1/2)*5x*12 = 30x. Solving 6x² = 30x gives x = 5. Thus, k = x - 3 = 2.\\n\\nNext, solve the system with k = 2:\\na + 10b/(a² + b²) = 5,\\nb + 10a/(a² + b²) = 4.\\nLet t = 10/(a² + b²). The system becomes linear in a and b:\\na + tb = 5,\\nta + b = 4.\\nSolving gives a = (5 - 4t)/(1 - t²), b = (4 - 5t)/(1 - t²). Substituting into a² + b² = 10/t leads to a quartic equation in t, which factors as a palindromic polynomial. Solving yields t = 1/2, 2, (4 ± 3i)/5. Corresponding (a, b) pairs are (4, 2), (1, 2), (5/2, 2 - 3i/2), and (5/2, 2 + 3i/2). All satisfy a² + b² ≠ 0.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(4, 2), (1, 2), (5/2, 2 - 3i/2), (5/2, 2 + 3i/2)\"\n}",
