  "math_problem": "Find two lines of symmetry of the graph of the function $y=x+\\frac{1}{x}$. Express your answer as two equations of the form $y=a x+b$. Instead of determining the equations of the lines of symmetry, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote parallel to the y-axis, derived from the asymptotic analysis of the curve. Determine all triplets of real numbers $(x, y, z)$ satisfying the system of equations $x^{2} y+y^{2} z =k+1039$, $x^{2} z+z^{2} y =260$, $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) =-540$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, identify the vertical asymptote of $ y = x + \\\\frac{1}{x} $, which is $ x = 0 $. The equation $ x = 0 $ can be written as $ 1 \\\\cdot x + 0 \\\\cdot y = 0 $, so the coefficient vector is $ (1, 0) $. The Euclidean norm of this vector is $ \\\\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 1 $, so $ k = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, solve the system with $ k = 1 $:\\n1. $ x^2 y + y^2 z = 1040 $\\n2. $ x^2 z + z^2 y = 260 $\\n3. $ (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) = -540 $\\n\\nBy testing integer values and analyzing the equations, two solutions are found:\\n- For $ z = 4 $, solving gives $ x = 1 $, $ y = 16 $, satisfying all equations.\\n- For $ z = 1 $, solving gives $ x = 16 $, $ y = 4 $, also satisfying all equations.\\n\\nFurther analysis using substitutions and quadratic equations confirms these are the only real solutions. The triplets are $ (1, 16, 4) $ and $ (16, 4, 1) $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(1,16,4),(16,4,1)\"\n}",
