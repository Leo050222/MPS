  "math_problem": "Find two lines of symmetry of the graph of the function $y=x+\\frac{1}{x}$. Express your answer as two equations of the form $y=a x+b$. Instead of determining the equations of the lines of symmetry, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote parallel to the y-axis, derived from the asymptotic analysis of the curve. Determine all triplets of real numbers $(x, y, z)$ satisfying the system of equations $x^{2} y+y^{2} z =k+1039$, $x^{2} z+z^{2} y =260$, $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) =-540$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding k, which is the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector of the vertical asymptote of $ y = x + \\\\frac{1}{x} $. The vertical asymptote is $ x = 0 $, written as $ 1 \\\\cdot x + 0 \\\\cdot y = 0 $. The coefficient vector is $ (1, 0) $, so its Euclidean norm is $ \\\\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 1 $, giving $ k = 1 $. Substituting $ k = 1 $ into the system, the first equation becomes $ x^2 y + y^2 z = 1040 $. By analyzing the system, we find $ y = 4z $ from $ \\\\frac{x^2 y + y^2 z}{x^2 z + z^2 y} = 4 $. Letting $ x = t z $, solving the resulting equations yields $ t = 16 $ or $ t = \\\\frac{1}{4} $. For $ t = 16 $, $ z = 1 $, giving $ (x, y, z) = (16, 4, 1) $. For $ t = \\\\frac{1}{4} $, $ z = 4 $, giving $ (x, y, z) = (1, 16, 4) $. Both triplets satisfy all equations, including the third condition $ (x-y)(y-z)(z-x) = -540 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(16, 4, 1), (1, 16, 4)\"\n}",
