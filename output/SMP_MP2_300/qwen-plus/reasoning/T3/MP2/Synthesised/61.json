  "math_problem": "You start with a single piece of chalk of length 1. Every second, you choose a piece of chalk that you have uniformly at random and break it in half. You continue this until you have 8 pieces of chalk. What is the probability that they all have length $\\frac{1}{8}$? Instead of computing the probability that all final pieces have equal length, simply find $k = \\binom{6}{3} - 16$, where $\\binom{6}{3}$ is the number of ways to interleave the remaining breaks between the two subtrees after the initial split, derived from the structural consideration of the balanced binary tree that produces uniform lengths. Yesterday, $n\\ge k$ people sat around a round table. Each participant remembers only who his two neighbours were, but not necessarily which one sat on his left and which one sat on his right. Today, you would like the same people to sit around the same round table so that each participant has the same two neighbours as yesterday (it is possible that yesterday’s left-hand side neighbour is today’s right-hand side neighbour). You are allowed to query some of the participants: if anyone is asked, he will answer by pointing at his two neighbours from yesterday.\n\na) Determine the minimal number $f(n)$ of participants you have to query in order to be certain to succeed, if later questions must not depend on the outcome of the previous questions. That is, you have to choose in advance the list of people you are going to query, before effectively asking any question.\n\nb) Determine the minimal number $g(n)$ of participants you have to query in order to be certain to succeed, if later questions may depend on the outcome of previous questions. That is, you can wait until you get the first answer to choose whom to ask the second question, and so on.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves determining the minimal number of participants to query to reconstruct a seating arrangement around a round table where each person has the same two neighbors as the previous day, allowing for reversal of left/right neighbors. The key insight is that the seating forms an undirected cycle graph, and the goal is to uniquely determine this graph.\\n\\nFor part (a), non-adaptive querying requires choosing all participants to query in advance. For a cycle graph:\\n- When $ n = 4 $, querying 1 person suffices because their two neighbors and the degree constraints (each person has exactly two neighbors) uniquely determine the entire graph.\\n- For $ n \\\\geq 5 $, querying 2 people is necessary because one query leaves ambiguity in the connections of the remaining nodes, while two queries eliminate all ambiguities.\\n\\nFor part (b), adaptive querying allows choosing subsequent queries based on previous answers. However, even with adaptivity:\\n- For $ n = 4 $, 1 query is sufficient.\\n- For $ n \\\\geq 5 $, 2 queries are still required because the first query reduces the possibilities but does not uniquely determine the graph, necessitating a second query.\\n\\nHowever, the problem specifies $ n \\\\geq k = 4 $, and the minimal number that works for all $ n \\\\geq 4 $ in the context of standard combinatorial results for cycle graphs (where determining sets for cycles require 2 vertices for $ n \\\\geq 5 $ and 1 for $ n = 4 $) leads to the conclusion that for general $ n \\\\geq 4 $, the minimal numbers are:\\n- $ f(n) = 2 $ for $ n \\\\geq 4 $ (non-adaptive, as the worst case for $ n \\\\geq 5 $ dominates).\\n- $ g(n) = 2 $ for $ n \\\\geq 4 $ (adaptive, as even with adaptivity, 2 queries are needed for $ n \\\\geq 5 $).\\n\\nThis aligns with the determining set theory for cycle graphs, where the determining number is 2 for $ n \\\\geq 5 $, and while $ n = 4 $ is a special case, the problem's requirement for a general answer valid for all $ n \\\\geq 4 $ results in 2 for both parts.\",\n  \"answer\": \"2\"\n}",
