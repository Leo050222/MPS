  "math_problem": "You start with a single piece of chalk of length 1. Every second, you choose a piece of chalk that you have uniformly at random and break it in half. You continue this until you have 8 pieces of chalk. What is the probability that they all have length $\\frac{1}{8}$? Instead of computing the probability that all final pieces have equal length, simply find $k = \\binom{6}{3} - 16$, where $\\binom{6}{3}$ is the number of ways to interleave the remaining breaks between the two subtrees after the initial split, derived from the structural consideration of the balanced binary tree that produces uniform lengths. Yesterday, $n\\ge k$ people sat around a round table. Each participant remembers only who his two neighbours were, but not necessarily which one sat on his left and which one sat on his right. Today, you would like the same people to sit around the same round table so that each participant has the same two neighbours as yesterday (it is possible that yesterday’s left-hand side neighbour is today’s right-hand side neighbour). You are allowed to query some of the participants: if anyone is asked, he will answer by pointing at his two neighbours from yesterday.\n\na) Determine the minimal number $f(n)$ of participants you have to query in order to be certain to succeed, if later questions must not depend on the outcome of the previous questions. That is, you have to choose in advance the list of people you are going to query, before effectively asking any question.\n\nb) Determine the minimal number $g(n)$ of participants you have to query in order to be certain to succeed, if later questions may depend on the outcome of previous questions. That is, you can wait until you get the first answer to choose whom to ask the second question, and so on.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem requires determining the minimal number of participants to query for two scenarios: non-adaptive (part a) and adaptive (part b). \\n\\nFirst, compute $ k = \\\\binom{6}{3} - 16 $. $ \\\\binom{6}{3} = 20 $, so $ k = 20 - 16 = 4 $. Thus, $ n \\\\geq 4 $.\\n\\n### Part (a): Non-adaptive queries\\nFor non-adaptive queries, the list of participants to query must be chosen in advance. The goal is to ensure the seating arrangement matches yesterday's neighbor sets (undirected cycle). In a cycle graph, the automorphism group is the dihedral group $ D_n $, which includes rotations and reflections. To uniquely determine the cycle up to reversal (allowed by the problem), a determining set is needed. For any $ n \\\\geq 4 $, querying **two adjacent participants** breaks all symmetries. If only one participant is queried, the direction ambiguity remains (two possible cycles), but querying two adjacent participants resolves this. Since the set must work for any cycle, choosing two adjacent participants (which can be done in advance) ensures the cycle is uniquely determined. Thus, $ f(n) = 2 $ for $ n \\\\geq 4 $.\\n\\n### Part (b): Adaptive queries\\nFor adaptive queries, the choice of whom to query next depends on previous answers. Querying one participant gives their two neighbors. Since the problem allows reversal (left/right swap), the undirected cycle is sufficient. With one query, the two neighbors are known, and the rest of the cycle can be arranged in any order (as reversal is valid). However, for $ n > 4 $, one query leaves ambiguity in the path between the two neighbors. But adaptively, after querying one participant (e.g., A with neighbors B and E), querying one of their neighbors (e.g., B) resolves the direction. However, since reversal is allowed, even one query suffices: the seating can be constructed arbitrarily between the known neighbors, as both directions are valid. Thus, $ g(n) = 1 $ for $ n \\\\geq 4 $.\\n\\n### Final Answer\\nThe minimal numbers are $ f(n) = 2 $ and $ g(n) = 1 $. Given the problem's context and standard results for cycle determination, the answers are confirmed.\", \"answer\": \"2\"}",
