  "math_problem": "There are $N$ lockers, labeled from 1 to $N$, placed in clockwise order around a circular hallway. Initially, all lockers are open. Ansoon starts at the first locker and always moves clockwise. When she is at locker $n$ and there are more than $n$ open lockers, she keeps locker $n$ open and closes the next $n$ open lockers, then repeats the process with the next open locker. If she is at locker $n$ and there are at most $n$ lockers still open, she keeps locker $n$ open and closes all other lockers. She continues this process until only one locker is left open. What is the smallest integer $N>2021$ such that the last open locker is locker 1? Instead of determining the smallest integer greater than a fixed threshold such that the locker elimination process results in the starting locker being the last open, simply find $l = $ last $+ 0$, where last is the label of the last open locker derived from the analysis of the process in that scenario. For an even integer positive integer $n$ Kevin has a tape of length $4 n$ with marks at $-2 n,-2 n+1, \\ldots, 2 n-1,2 n$. He then randomly picks $n$ points in the set $-n,-n+1,-n+2, \\ldots, n-1, n$, and places a stone on each of these points. We call a stone 'stuck' if it is on $2 n$ or $-2 n$, or either all the points to the right, or all the points to the left, all contain stones. Then, every minute, Kevin shifts the unstuck stones in the following manner: He picks an unstuck stone uniformly at random and then flips a fair coin. If the coin came up heads, he then moves that stone and every stone in the largest contiguous set containing that stone one point to the left. If the coin came up tails, he moves every stone in that set one point right instead. He repeats until all the stones are stuck. Let $p_{k}$ be the probability that at the end of the process there are exactly $k$ stones in the right half. Evaluate $$\\frac{\\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k}{\\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} p_k}$$ in terms of $n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main components. First, determining $ l $ based on the locker elimination process. The problem states that instead of finding the smallest $ N > 2021 $ where the last open locker is 1, we directly take $ l = \\\\text{last} + 0 $, where last is the label of the last open locker in that scenario. Since the last open locker is 1 (as required for the scenario), $ l = 1 + 0 = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, analyzing the stone process on the tape. For an even integer $ n $, Kevin places $ n $ stones on a tape from $-2n$ to $ 2n $. The process ends when all stones are stuck, which occurs when stones form contiguous blocks at the far left or right ends, or split between both ends. The key insight is symmetry: the probability $ p_k $ of having $ k $ stones in the right half satisfies $ p_k = p_{n-k} $ due to reflection symmetry.\\n\\nThe required ratio is:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-k} p_k}{\\\\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} p_k}\\n$$\\nWith $ l = 1 $, the sums run from $ k = 1 $ to $ k = n-1 $. For even $ n $, $ n-1 $ is odd. By symmetry $ p_k = p_{n-k} $, the alternating sum in the numerator simplifies. For example, when $ n = 2 $, the ratio is $ p_1 / p_1 = 1 $. Generalizing, the alternating sum equals the regular sum due to symmetry and the properties of the process, leading to the ratio being 1 for any even $ n $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
