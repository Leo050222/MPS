  "math_problem": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form. Determine all the roots, real or complex, of the system of simultaneous equations $x + y + z = m$, $x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = m$, $x^{m} + y^{m} + z^{m} = m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, define $ g(m) = f(5m) $ where $ f(n) $ is the probability starting from $ n $ rocks. For $ n = 5m $, $ g(m) = \\\\frac{1}{5m} \\\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} g(k) $ with $ g(0) = 1 $. The sum $ S(m) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^m g(k) $ satisfies $ S(m) = S(m-1) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{5m + 1}{5m} $. For $ m = 403 $ (since $ 2015 = 5 \\\\times 403 $), $ p = g(403) = \\\\frac{S(402)}{5 \\\\times 403} $.\\n\\nAnalyzing the exponent of 31 in $ p $:\\n- Numerator (product $ 6 \\\\times 11 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times 2011 $) has 13 terms divisible by 31, with one term ($ 5 \\\\times 192 + 1 = 961 = 31^2 $) contributing an extra factor, totaling 14 factors of 31.\\n- Denominator ($ 403! $) has $ \\\\lfloor 403/31 \\\\rfloor = 13 $ factors of 31.\\n- Thus, $ b = 14 - 13 = 1 $, so $ m = b + 2 = 3 $.\\n\\nSolving the system $ x + y + z = 3 $, $ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3 $, $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 $:\\n- Using symmetric sums, $ s_1 = 3 $, $ s_2 = 3 $, $ s_3 = 1 $.\\n- The characteristic polynomial is $ t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t - 1 = (t - 1)^3 $, so all roots are $ 1 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1, 1, 1\"\n}",
