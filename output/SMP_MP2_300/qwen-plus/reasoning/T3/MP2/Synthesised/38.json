  "math_problem": "Roger initially has 20 socks in a drawer, each of which is either white or black. He chooses a sock uniformly at random from the drawer and throws it away. He repeats this action until there are equal numbers of white and black socks remaining. Suppose that the probability he stops before all socks are gone is $p$. If the sum of all distinct possible values of $p$ over all initial combinations of socks is $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the sum of all distinct possible values of the stopping probability over all initial combinations of socks, simply find $p_{10}$, the stopping probability when the drawer initially contains an equal number of white and black socks. There are $p_{10} + \\frac{38324}{19}$ frogs in a pool and there is 1 frog on the shore. In each time-step thereafter, one random frog moves position. If it was in the pool, it jumps to the shore, and vice versa. Find the expected number of time-steps before all frogs are in the pool for the first time.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by identifying the key components and simplifying the scenario step by step.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Step 1: Determine $ p_{10} $**\\n\\nThe problem states that Roger initially has 20 socks (10 white and 10 black), and he removes one sock at a time until the number of white and black socks remaining are equal. The probability that he stops before all socks are gone is denoted as $ p $. We are asked to find $ p_{10} $, which corresponds to the case where the initial counts of white and black socks are equal (i.e., 10 each).\\n\\nThis situation is equivalent to a random walk on the number of white socks removed from the drawer. At each step, a sock is randomly selected and discarded. The process stops when the number of white and black socks remaining are equal — i.e., when the number of white socks thrown away equals the number of black socks thrown away.\\n\\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem related to the first return to zero in a symmetric random walk with finite steps. For $ n $ pairs of socks (i.e., $ n $ white and $ n $ black), the probability that the process stops **before** all socks are gone is:\\n\\n$$\\np_n = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{2n - 1}\\n$$\\n\\nFor $ n = 10 $:\\n\\n$$\\np_{10} = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{19} = \\\\frac{18}{19}\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Step 2: Compute Total Frogs in Pool**\\n\\nWe are told:\\n\\n> \\\"There are $ p_{10} + \\\\frac{38324}{19} $ frogs in a pool and there is 1 frog on the shore.\\\"\\n\\nSubstitute $ p_{10} = \\\\frac{18}{19} $:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Frogs in pool} = \\\\frac{18}{19} + \\\\frac{38324}{19} = \\\\frac{38342}{19} = 2018\\n$$\\n\\nSo, there are **2018 frogs in the pool**, and **1 frog on the shore**, making a total of:\\n\\n$$\\nN = 2018 + 1 = 2019 \\\\text{ frogs}\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Step 3: Model the Frog Movement Process**\\n\\nAt each time step, one random frog moves between the pool and the shore:\\n- If it's in the pool, it jumps to the shore.\\n- If it's on the shore, it jumps to the pool.\\n\\nWe are to compute the **expected number of time-steps** before **all frogs are in the pool for the first time**, starting from 1 frog on the shore.\\n\\nThis is a well-known Markov chain problem. Let $ E_k $ be the expected number of steps to reach the state where all frogs are in the pool (i.e., 0 frogs on the shore) starting from $ k $ frogs on the shore.\\n\\nFrom known results in Markov chain theory, particularly for this specific setup (a symmetric random walk on the hypercube graph), the expected time to reach the absorbing state (all frogs in the pool) from a single frog on the shore is:\\n\\n$$\\nE_1 = 2^N - 1\\n$$\\n\\nWhere $ N $ is the total number of frogs.\\n\\nIn our case, $ N = 2019 $, so:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Expected time} = 2^{2019} - 1\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Final Answer**\",\n    \"answer\": \"2^2019 - 1\"\n}",
