  "math_problem": "Roger initially has 20 socks in a drawer, each of which is either white or black. He chooses a sock uniformly at random from the drawer and throws it away. He repeats this action until there are equal numbers of white and black socks remaining. Suppose that the probability he stops before all socks are gone is $p$. If the sum of all distinct possible values of $p$ over all initial combinations of socks is $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the sum of all distinct possible values of the stopping probability over all initial combinations of socks, simply find $p_{10}$, the stopping probability when the drawer initially contains an equal number of white and black socks. There are $p_{10} + \\frac{38324}{19}$ frogs in a pool and there is 1 frog on the shore. In each time-step thereafter, one random frog moves position. If it was in the pool, it jumps to the shore, and vice versa. Find the expected number of time-steps before all frogs are in the pool for the first time.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine $ p_{10} $, the stopping probability when Roger starts with 10 white and 10 black socks. This is the probability he stops before all socks are gone, i.e., before reaching 0 remaining socks. Using the reflection principle and properties of symmetric random walks, the probability of stopping before all socks are gone for $ n $ pairs of socks is $ 1 - \\\\frac{1}{2n - 1} $. For $ n = 10 $, this gives $ p_{10} = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{19} = \\\\frac{18}{19} $.\\n\\nNext, we calculate the number of frogs in the pool: $ p_{10} + \\\\frac{38324}{19} = \\\\frac{18}{19} + \\\\frac{38324}{19} = \\\\frac{38342}{19} = 2018 $. With 1 frog on the shore, the total number of frogs is $ 2018 + 1 = 2019 $.\\n\\nThe problem now reduces to finding the expected time for all frogs to be in the pool, starting with 1 frog on the shore. This is a classic Markov chain problem where each step involves moving a random frog between the pool and shore. The expected time to reach all frogs in the pool from 1 frog on the shore for $ N $ total frogs is known to be $ 2^N - 1 $. For $ N = 2019 $, the expected time is $ 2^{2019} - 1 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2^2019 - 1\"\n}",
