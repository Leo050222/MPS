  "math_problem": "Let $a \\star b=ab-2$. Compute the remainder when $(((579 \\star 569) \\star 559) \\star \\cdots \\star 19) \\star 9$ is divided by 100. Instead of determining the value modulo 100 of the iterated binary operation on the given decreasing sequence of integers, simply find $d$, where $d$ is the tens digit of the final operand in that sequence. Find the number of 7-tuples $\\left(n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{7}\\right)$ of integers such that $$\\sum_{i=1}^{7} n_{i}^{6}=d + 96957$$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding the number of 7-tuples of integers where the sum of their sixth powers equals $d + 96957$, with $d$ being the tens digit of the final operand in the sequence $579, 569, \\\\ldots, 9$. The final operand is 9, which has a tens digit of 0, so $d = 0$. Thus, the target sum is $96957$.\\n\\nAnalyzing modulo constraints:\\n- Modulo 7: Each sixth power is 0 or 1 mod 7. Since $96957 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod 7$, all 7 terms must contribute 1 mod 7 (i.e., none divisible by 7).\\n- Modulo 9: Sixth powers are 0 or 1 mod 9. $96957 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod 9$ implies all terms must be divisible by 3. Let $n_i = 3p_i$, reducing the equation to $\\\\sum p_i^6 = 133$.\\n- Modulo 16: Sixth powers of odd integers are 1 mod 16, even are 0. $133 \\\\equiv 5 \\\\mod 16$ implies exactly 5 odd $p_i$.\\n\\nPossible values for $p_i^6$: 0, 1, 64 (since $3^6 = 729 > 133$). Solving $64a + b = 133$ with $a + b = 7$ gives $a = 2$ (two terms with $|p_i| = 2$) and $b = 5$ (five terms with $|p_i| = 1$). Each non-zero $p_i$ has 2 sign choices. The number of tuples is:\\n- Choose 2 positions for $|p_i| = 2$: $\\\\binom{7}{2} = 21$.\\n- Sign choices for these: $2^2 = 4$.\\n- Sign choices for the remaining 5 positions: $2^5 = 32$.\\nTotal: $21 \\\\times 4 \\\\times 32 = 2688$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2688\"\n}",
