  "math_problem": "Let $a \\star b=ab-2$. Compute the remainder when $(((579 \\star 569) \\star 559) \\star \\cdots \\star 19) \\star 9$ is divided by 100. Instead of determining the value modulo 100 of the iterated binary operation on the given decreasing sequence of integers, simply find $d$, where $d$ is the tens digit of the final operand in that sequence. Find the number of 7-tuples $\\left(n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{7}\\right)$ of integers such that $$\\sum_{i=1}^{7} n_{i}^{6}=d + 96957$$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding the number of 7-tuples of integers where the sum of their sixth powers equals $d + 96957$, with $d$ being the tens digit of the final operand in the sequence $579, 569, \\\\ldots, 19, 9$. The final operand is 9, whose tens digit is 0 (since single-digit numbers have a tens digit of 0), so $d = 0$. Thus, the target sum is $96957$.\\n\\nAnalyzing sixth powers of integers:\\n- $6^6 = 46656$, $3^6 = 729$, and higher/lower values either exceed or fall short of the required sum.\\n- The only valid combination for 7 terms is $2 \\\\times 46656 + 5 \\\\times 729 = 96957$.\\n\\nCounting valid tuples:\\n- Choose 2 positions out of 7 for $|n_i| = 6$: $\\\\binom{7}{2} = 21$.\\n- Each of these 2 positions has 2 sign choices ($\\\\pm 6$): $2^2 = 4$.\\n- The remaining 5 positions ($|n_i| = 3$) each have 2 sign choices ($\\\\pm 3$): $2^5 = 32$.\\n- Total tuples: $21 \\\\times 4 \\\\times 32 = 2688$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2688\"\n}",
