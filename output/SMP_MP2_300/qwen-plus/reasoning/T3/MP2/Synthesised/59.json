  "math_problem": "Jude repeatedly flips a coin. If he has already flipped $n$ heads, the coin lands heads with probability $\\frac{1}{n+2}$ and tails with probability $\\frac{n+1}{n+2}$. If Jude continues flipping forever, let $p$ be the probability that he flips 3 heads in a row at some point. Compute $\\lfloor 180 p \\rfloor$. Instead of computing the floor of 180 times the probability of eventually flipping three heads in a row, simply find $\\delta = p_5 - \\frac{53}{72}$, where $p_5$ is the probability that the fifth head is preceded by a tail and that no three consecutive heads have occurred in the sequence up to the fifth head, as derived from analyzing the process to avoid three consecutive heads. Compute the number of ways a non-self-intersecting concave quadrilateral can be drawn in the plane such that two of its vertices are $(\\delta, \\delta)$ and $(1, \\delta)$, and the other two vertices are two distinct lattice points $(a, b),(c, d)$ with $0 \\leq a, c \\leq 59$ and $1 \\leq b, d \\leq 5$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine $\\\\delta = p_5 - \\\\frac{53}{72}$, where $p_5$ is the probability that the fifth head is preceded by a tail and no three consecutive heads have occurred up to the fifth head.\\n\\n### Step 1: Understanding the Coin Flip Process\\n\\n- When $n$ heads have been flipped, the probability of flipping a head is $\\\\frac{1}{n+2}$, and the probability of flipping a tail is $\\\\frac{n+1}{n+2}$.\\n- We are interested in sequences where:\\n  - The fifth head is **preceded by a tail** (i.e., there is at least one tail between the fourth and fifth head).\\n  - No **three consecutive heads** occur in the sequence up to the fifth head.\\n\\n### Step 2: Calculating $p_5$\\n\\nLet’s consider all valid sequences with exactly five heads, ending with a tail followed by the fifth head (i.e., the fifth head is not part of a run of three consecutive heads).\\n\\n- Total probability of having five heads with the fifth head **not immediately after the fourth** (i.e., at least one tail between them) is $\\\\frac{5}{6}$.\\n- Invalid cases (where three consecutive heads occur):\\n  - Case 1: Heads 1, 2, 3 are consecutive ($t_2 = t_3 = 0$), and $t_5 \\\\geq 1$: Probability = $\\\\frac{5}{72}$\\n  - Case 2: Heads 2, 3, 4 are consecutive ($t_3 = t_4 = 0$), and $t_5 \\\\geq 1$: Probability = $\\\\frac{3}{72}$\\n  - Overlap (Heads 1–4 are consecutive): Probability = $\\\\frac{1}{72}$\\n- Total invalid probability = $\\\\frac{5}{72} + \\\\frac{3}{72} - \\\\frac{1}{72} = \\\\frac{7}{72}$\\n- Valid probability $p_5 = \\\\frac{5}{6} - \\\\frac{7}{72} = \\\\frac{60}{72} - \\\\frac{7}{72} = \\\\frac{53}{72}$\\n\\nThus, $\\\\delta = p_5 - \\\\frac{53}{72} = 0$.\\n\\n### Step 3: Counting Concave Quadrilaterals\\n\\nWe now compute the number of non-self-intersecting concave quadrilaterals with vertices:\\n- Two fixed points: $(\\\\delta, \\\\delta) = (0, 0)$ and $(1, \\\\delta) = (1, 0)$\\n- Two distinct lattice points $(a, b), (c, d)$ with $0 \\\\leq a, c \\\\leq 59$, $1 \\\\leq b, d \\\\leq 5$\\n\\n#### Key Observations:\\n- All such quadrilaterals are **non-self-intersecting**, since both upper points lie above the x-axis (y ≥ 1), and the base AB lies on the x-axis.\\n- A quadrilateral is **concave** if and only if **one of the upper points lies inside the triangle formed by the other three points**.\\n- For two distinct upper points $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$, the quadrilateral is concave if and only if:\\n  - $a < c$ and $b > d$, or\\n  - $a > c$ and $b < d$\\n\\nThis corresponds to **inversions** in the y-coordinates when sorted by x-coordinate.\\n\\n#### Counting Inversions:\\n- Number of x-coordinate pairs: $\\\\binom{60}{2} = 1770$\\n- For each pair of x-coordinates, the number of y-inversion pairs (where $b > d$) is $\\\\binom{5}{2} = 10$\\n- Total number of concave quadrilaterals = $1770 \\\\times 10 = 17700$\", \"answer\": \"17700\"}",
