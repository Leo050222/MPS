  "math_problem": "For a given positive integer $n$, we define $\\varphi(n)$ to be the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ which share no common prime factors with $n$. Find all positive integers $n$ for which $\\varphi(2019 n)=\\varphi\\left(n^{2}\\right)$. Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ for which $\\varphi(2019 n)=\\varphi(n^2)$, simply find $k=\\gcd(2019,n)-2018$, where $n$ is the positive integer solution that is a multiple of $2019$. The sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$ of real numbers satisfies the recurrence $a_{n+1}=\\frac{a_{n}^{2}-a_{n-1}+2 a_{n}}{a_{n-1}+k}$. Given that $a_{1}=k$ and $a_{9}=7$, find $a_{5}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, factorize 2019 as 3 × 673 (both primes). Since n is a multiple of 2019, let n = 2019m. The equation φ(2019n) = φ(n²) requires analyzing Euler's totient function. For n = 3^a × 673^b × k (k coprime to 3, 673), equating φ(2019n) and φ(n²) leads to constraints on exponents a, b. Solving shows a = 1, b = 1, and k = 1, so n = 2019. Thus, gcd(2019, n) = 2019, giving k = 2019 - 2018 = 1.\\n\\nNext, the recurrence aₙ₊₁ = (aₙ² - aₙ₋₁ + 2aₙ)/(aₙ₋₁ + 1) with a₁ = 1 and a₉ = 7 is analyzed. Defining bₙ = aₙ + 1 transforms the recurrence into bₙ₊₁bₙ₋₁ = bₙ², indicating bₙ is geometric. With b₁ = 2 and b₉ = 8, the common ratio satisfies r⁸ = 4, so r⁴ = 2. Thus, b₅ = 2 × r⁴ = 4, giving a₅ = 4 - 1 = 3.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
