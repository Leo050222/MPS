Instead of finding all positive integer pairs that make the given expression prime, simply find $m$, the prime number equal to that expression. Manya has a stack of $85=1+4+16+64$ blocks comprised of 4 layers (the $k$ th layer from the top has $4^{k-1}$ blocks). Each block rests on 4 smaller blocks, each with dimensions half those of the larger block. Laura removes blocks one at a time from this stack, removing only blocks that currently have no blocks on top of them. Find the number of ways Laura can remove precisely $m$ blocks from Manya's stack (the order in which they are removed matters).",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we proceed in two distinct parts:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Part 1: Finding the Prime Number $ m = a^4 + 4b^4 $**\\n\\nWe are given the expression $ a^4 + 4b^4 $ and asked to find all positive integers $ a, b $ such that this expression is prime. The goal is to determine the value of $ m $, which is the only such prime number.\\n\\nThis expression can be factored using the **Sophie Germain identity**:\\n\\n$$\\na^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2)\\n$$\\n\\nFor the product to be prime, one of the factors must equal 1 (since primes have exactly two positive divisors: 1 and themselves). Let’s examine both factors:\\n\\n- $ F_1 = a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2 $\\n- $ F_2 = a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2 $\\n\\nSince $ a, b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ $, $ F_1 > F_2 $. So we set $ F_2 = 1 $:\\n\\n$$\\na^2 - 2ab + 2b^2 = 1 \\\\Rightarrow (a - b)^2 + b^2 = 1\\n$$\\n\\nThe only solution in positive integers is $ a = b = 1 $, since $ b \\\\geq 1 $ implies $ b^2 \\\\geq 1 $, so $ (a - b)^2 = 0 \\\\Rightarrow a = b $, and then $ b^2 = 1 \\\\Rightarrow b = 1 $.\\n\\nThus, $ a = b = 1 $, and:\\n\\n$$\\nm = 1^4 + 4 \\\\cdot 1^4 = 1 + 4 = 5\\n$$\\n\\nThis is the **only** prime value for $ a^4 + 4b^4 $ with $ a, b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ $, so $ m = 5 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Part 2: Counting the Number of Ways to Remove 5 Blocks**\\n\\nManya's stack consists of 4 layers:\\n\\n- Layer 1 (top): 1 block\\n- Layer 2: 4 blocks\\n- Layer 3: 16 blocks\\n- Layer 4: 64 blocks\\n\\nTotal: $ 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 = 85 $ blocks.\\n\\nEach block rests on 4 smaller blocks from the layer below. This forms a **tree structure**, where each node has up to 4 children.\\n\\nLaura removes blocks **one at a time**, but **only those with no blocks on top of them**. That means a block can only be removed after all its ancestors (blocks above it) have been removed.\\n\\nWe are to count the number of **distinct sequences** in which Laura can remove **exactly 5 blocks**, where the order matters.\\n\\n#### **Key Observations**\\n\\n- The first block removed must be the **topmost block** (Layer 1), as it has no blocks on top.\\n- After removing the top block, the next available blocks are the 4 blocks in Layer 2.\\n- Each subsequent removal depends on the dependencies: a block can only be removed after its parent is removed.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of **linear extensions** of length 5 in the poset defined by the tree structure.\\n\\nLet’s denote:\\n\\n- $ h(k) $: the number of ways to remove $ k $ blocks from a single subtree rooted at a Layer 2 block (which includes the root itself).\\n\\nWe compute $ h(k) $ for $ k = 1 $ to $ 4 $:\\n\\n- $ h(1) = 1 $: only the root (Layer 2 block)\\n- $ h(2) = 4 $: root + one child (Layer 3 block)\\n- $ h(3) = 28 $: combinations of root + 2 Layer 3 blocks or root + 1 Layer 3 + 1 Layer 4\\n- $ h(4) = 264 $: combinations involving more complex structures\\n\\nNow, we consider all possible partitions of the 4 remaining blocks (after the top block) among the 4 subtrees rooted at Layer 2 blocks. These partitions correspond to how many blocks are removed from each subtree.\\n\\nWe sum over all valid partitions of 4 into parts $ \\\\geq 1 $, considering the number of ways to choose which subtrees contribute how many blocks, and the number of interleavings of the sequences.\\n\\n#### **Case Analysis**\\n\\n| Partition | Subtree Contributions | Ways to Choose | Interleavings | Total |\\n|-----------|------------------------|----------------|---------------|-------|\\n| (1,1,1,1) | All 4 subtrees contribute 1 block | $ \\\\binom{4}{4} = 1 $ | $ \\\\frac{4!}{1!1!1!1!} = 24 $ | $ 1 \\\\times 24 = 24 $ |\\n| (2,1,1,0) | One subtree contributes 2, two contribute 1 | $ \\\\binom{4}{1} \\\\binom{3}{2} = 12 $ | $ \\\\frac{4!}{2!1!1!} = 12 $ | $ 12 \\\\times 4 \\\\times 1 \\\\times 1 \\\\times 12 = 576 $ |\\n| (3,1,0,0) | One subtree contributes 3, one contributes 1 | $ \\\\binom{4}{1} \\\\binom{3}{1} = 12 $ | $ \\\\frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4 $ | $ 12 \\\\times 28 \\\\times 1 \\\\times 4 = 1344 $ |\\n| (2,2,0,0) | Two subtrees contribute 2 | $ \\\\binom{4}{2} = 6 $ | $ \\\\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 $ | $ 6 \\\\times 4 \\\\times 4 \\\\times 6 = 576 $ |\\n| (4,0,0,0) | One subtree contributes 4 | $ \\\\binom{4}{1} = 4 $ | $ \\\\frac{4!}{4!} = 1 $ | $ 4 \\\\times 264 = 1056 $ |\\n\\n#### **Total Number of Sequences**\\n\\n$$\\n24 + 576 + 1344 + 576 + 1056 = 3576\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"3576\"}",
