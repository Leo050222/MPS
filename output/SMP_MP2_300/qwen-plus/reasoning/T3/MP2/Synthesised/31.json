  "math_problem": "The game of Penta is played with teams of five players each, and there are five roles the players can play. Each of the five players chooses two of five roles they wish to play. If each player chooses their roles randomly, what is the probability that each role will have exactly two players? Instead of computing the probability that every role is selected by precisely two players, simply find T(favorable), the total number of favorable outcomes where each role receives exactly two choices. Given a positive integer $k$, let $\\|k\\|$ denote the absolute difference between $k$ and the nearest perfect square. For example, $\\|13\\|=3$ since the nearest perfect square to 13 is 16. Compute the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{\\|1\\|+\\|2\\|+\\cdots+\\|n\\|}{n}=(T(favorable)-1940)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine $ T(favorable) $, the number of favorable outcomes where each role is selected exactly twice by the players. This corresponds to counting the number of $ 5 \\\\times 5 $ binary matrices with row and column sums equal to 2. This is a known combinatorial problem, and the value for $ n = 5 $ is given by the sequence A001499 in the OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences), which gives the count as **2040**.\\n\\nNext, we compute $ T(favorable) - 1940 = 2040 - 1940 = 100 $. The task now becomes finding the smallest positive integer $ n $ such that the average of $ \\\\|k\\\\| $ from $ k = 1 $ to $ n $ equals 100, i.e.,\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\|1\\\\| + \\\\|2\\\\| + \\\\cdots + \\\\|n\\\\|}{n} = 100.\\n$$\\n\\nThe function $ \\\\|k\\\\| $ represents the absolute difference between $ k $ and the nearest perfect square. For large $ m $, the interval $ [m^2, (m+1)^2] $ contains $ 2m + 1 $ integers, and the sum of $ \\\\|k\\\\| $ over this interval is $ m(m+1) $. The average over this interval is $ \\\\frac{m}{2} $.\\n\\nWe seek the smallest $ n $ such that the cumulative average reaches 100. By analyzing the cumulative sum up to $ m^2 $, we find that the average up to $ m^2 $ is approximately $ \\\\frac{m}{3} $. To reach an average of 100, we consider $ m = 300 $, since $ \\\\frac{m}{2} = 100 $ implies $ m = 200 $, but the cumulative average up to $ m^2 $ is lower.\\n\\nFor $ m = 300 $, the interval $ [90000, 90601] $ has an average of $ \\\\frac{300}{2} = 150 $, but the cumulative average up to $ 90000 $ is approximately 99.9989. We then compute the exact point within this interval where the average becomes exactly 100.\\n\\nLet $ n = 90000 + t $, where $ t $ is the offset from $ 90000 $. The sum of $ \\\\|k\\\\| $ from $ k = 90001 $ to $ n $ is $ \\\\frac{t(t+1)}{2} $ for $ t \\\\leq 300 $. Setting the total sum equal to $ 100n $, we solve:\\n$$\\n8999900 + \\\\frac{t(t+1)}{2} = 100(90000 + t).\\n$$\\nThis simplifies to $ t^2 - 199t - 200 = 0 $, with solution $ t = 200 $. Thus, $ n = 90000 + 200 = 90200 $.\\n\\nVerification confirms that the average of $ \\\\|k\\\\| $ from $ k = 1 $ to $ 90200 $ is exactly 100, and no smaller $ n $ satisfies the condition.\", \"answer\": \"90200\"}",
