  "math_problem": "Tetrahedron $A B C D$ has side lengths $A B=6, B D=6 \\sqrt{2}, B C=10, A C=8, C D=10$, and $A D=6$. The distance from vertex $A$ to face $B C D$ can be written as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are positive integers, $b$ is square-free, and $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$. Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of computing the encoded value $100a + 10b + c$ from the parameters of the distance expression, simply find $d = \\gcd(a, c) + 0$, where $a, b, c$ are the positive integers such that the distance is $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$ with $b$ square-free and $\\gcd(a, c)=1$. Find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(x, y)$ with $x, y \\leq 2020$ such that $3 x^{2}+10 x y+3 y^{2}$ is the power of some prime $p^k$ for integer $k \\geq d$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs (x, y) with x, y ≤ 2020 such that 3x² + 10xy + 3y² is a prime power p^k for k ≥ d, where d = gcd(a, c) = 1 (since the distance from A to face BCD is given in reduced form with gcd(a, c) = 1).\\n\\nFirst, factor the quadratic form: 3x² + 10xy + 3y² = (3x + y)(x + 3y). For this product to be a prime power p^k, both factors must be powers of the same prime p. Solving the system:\\n- 3x + y = p^m\\n- x + 3y = p^n\\n\\nyields x = (3p^m - p^n)/8 and y = (3p^n - p^m)/8. Positivity and integrality constraints lead to p = 2 as the only possible prime. Three cases arise:\\n\\n1. **x = y**: Here, (4x)² = 16x² = 2^k. Thus, x = y = 2^s (s ≥ 0). Valid for 2^s ≤ 2020 ⇒ s = 0 to 10 (11 pairs).\\n2. **x = 2^s, y = 5·2^s**: Requires 5·2^s ≤ 2020 ⇒ s = 0 to 8 (9 pairs).\\n3. **x = 5·2^s, y = 2^s**: Requires 5·2^s ≤ 2020 ⇒ s = 0 to 8 (9 pairs).\\n\\nNo overlaps exist between cases. Total ordered pairs: 11 + 9 + 9 = 29.\",\n    \"answer\": \"29\"\n}",
