Find the number of anti-palindromes less than $3^{12}$ such that no two consecutive digits in base 3 are equal. Instead of determining the total count of qualifying anti-palindromes, simply find $k = b_1 + 27$, where $b_1$ is the number of valid anti-palindromes with one digit derived from the anti-palindrome condition and the no consecutive equal digits constraint. Ten positive integers are arranged around a circle. Each number is one more than the greatest common divisor of its two neighbors. What is the sum of the ten numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we focus on determining $ b_1 $, the number of one-digit anti-palindromes in base 3 that satisfy both the anti-palindrome condition and the constraint that no two consecutive digits are equal.\\n\\n### Step 1: Understanding the Anti-Palindrome Condition\\nA number is an **anti-palindrome** if, when written in base 3 as $ a_n a_{n-1} \\\\ldots a_0 $, it satisfies:\\n$$\\n a_i + a_{n-i} = 2 \\\\quad \\\\text{for all } 0 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n.\\n$$\\n\\nFor a **one-digit number**, $ n = 0 $, so the only digit is $ a_0 $. The condition becomes:\\n$$\\n a_0 + a_0 = 2 \\\\Rightarrow 2a_0 = 2 \\\\Rightarrow a_0 = 1.\\n$$\\nThus, the only valid one-digit anti-palindrome in base 3 is the digit **1**.\\n\\n### Step 2: Applying the No Consecutive Equal Digits Constraint\\nThe problem also requires that **no two consecutive digits in base 3 are equal**. However, for a one-digit number, there are **no pairs of consecutive digits**, so this condition is **vacuously true**. Therefore, the single-digit number **1** automatically satisfies this constraint.\\n\\n### Step 3: Counting Valid One-Digit Anti-Palindromes\\n- Base 3 digits are $ \\\\{0, 1, 2\\\\} $.\\n- Only $ a_0 = 1 $ satisfies the anti-palindrome condition.\\n- This value also satisfies the no-consecutive-equal-digits constraint.\\n\\nHence, $ b_1 = 1 $.\\n\\n### Step 4: Computing $ k = b_1 + 27 $\\n$$\\n k = b_1 + 27 = 1 + 27 = 28.\\n$$\\n\\n### Final Note\\nThe second part of the problem statement about ten positive integers arranged around a circle appears to be unrelated or possibly a formatting error. Since the problem explicitly instructs us to compute $ k = b_1 + 27 $, we disregard any extraneous information and focus solely on the anti-palindrome condition.\",\n    \"answer\": \"28\"\n}",
