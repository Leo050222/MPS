  "math_problem": "Define a number to be an anti-palindrome if, when written in base 3 as $a_{n} a_{n-1} \\ldots a_{0}$, then $a_{i}+a_{n-i}=2$ for any $0 \\leq i \\leq n$. Find the number of anti-palindromes less than $3^{12}$ such that no two consecutive digits in base 3 are equal. Instead of determining the total count of qualifying anti-palindromes, simply find $k = b_1 + 27$, where $b_1$ is the number of valid anti-palindromes with one digit derived from the anti-palindrome condition and the no consecutive equal digits constraint. Ten positive integers are arranged around a circle. Each number is one more than the greatest common divisor of its two neighbors. What is the sum of the ten numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"An anti-palindrome in base 3 with one digit (n=0) must satisfy $a_0 + a_0 = 2$, which implies $a_0 = 1$. The only one-digit base 3 numbers are 0, 1, and 2. Checking the condition:\\n- 0: $0 + 0 = 0 \\\\neq 2$ ❌\\n- 1: $1 + 1 = 2$ ✅\\n- 2: $2 + 2 = 4 \\\\neq 2$ ❌\\n\\nThus, only the digit 1 qualifies. The no-consecutive-equal-digits condition is vacuously true for single-digit numbers. Hence, $b_1 = 1$. Therefore, $k = b_1 + 27 = 1 + 27 = 28$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"28\"\n}",
