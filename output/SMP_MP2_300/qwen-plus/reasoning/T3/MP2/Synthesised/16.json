  "math_problem": "Alice draws three cards from a standard 52-card deck with replacement. Ace through 10 are worth 1 to 10 points respectively, and the face cards King, Queen, and Jack are each worth 10 points. The probability that the sum of the point values of the cards drawn is a multiple of 10 can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing a hundred times the numerator plus the denominator of the fraction representing the probability in lowest terms, simply find $k = d + 0$, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that probability fraction. Suppose $P(x)$ is a polynomial such that $P(1)=1$ and $$\\frac{P(2 x)}{P(x+1)}=8-\\frac{56}{x+7}$$ for all real $x$ for which both sides are defined. Find $P(-k)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main parts. First, determining the value of $ k $, which is defined as $ d + 0 $, where $ d $ is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator of the probability fraction in lowest terms. Since the probability is given in lowest terms ($ \\\\gcd(m, n) = 1 $), $ d = 1 $, so $ k = 1 $. \\n\\nNext, we analyze the polynomial $ P(x) $ satisfying $ P(1) = 1 $ and the functional equation:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{P(2x)}{P(x+1)} = 8 - \\\\frac{56}{x+7}.\\n$$\\nSimplifying the right-hand side gives:\\n$$\\n8 - \\\\frac{56}{x+7} = \\\\frac{8x}{x+7}.\\n$$\\nThus, the equation becomes:\\n$$\\nP(2x) = \\\\frac{8x}{x+7} P(x+1).\\n$$\\nMultiplying both sides by $ x+7 $ yields:\\n$$\\n(x+7)P(2x) = 8xP(x+1).\\n$$\\nAssuming $ P(x) $ is a cubic polynomial (determined by matching degrees), we solve for coefficients and find:\\n$$\\nP(x) = \\\\frac{1}{21}x(x+2)(x+6).\\n$$\\nVerifying $ P(1) = 1 $ and the functional equation confirms correctness. Finally, evaluating $ P(-k) = P(-1) $:\\n$$\\nP(-1) = \\\\frac{1}{21}(-1)(1)(5) = -\\\\frac{5}{21}.\\n$$\",\n    \"answer\": \"-5/21\"\n}",
