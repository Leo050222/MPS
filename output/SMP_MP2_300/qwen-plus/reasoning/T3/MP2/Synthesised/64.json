  "math_problem": "Regular hexagon $P_{1} P_{2} P_{3} P_{4} P_{5} P_{6}$ has side length 2. For $1 \\leq i \\leq 6$, let $C_{i}$ be a unit circle centered at $P_{i}$ and $\\ell_{i}$ be one of the internal common tangents of $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+2}$, where $C_{7}=C_{1}$ and $C_{8}=C_{2}$. Assume that the lines $\\{\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}, \\ell_{5}, \\ell_{6}\\}$ bound a regular hexagon. The area of this hexagon can be expressed as $\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of determining the value 100 times the numerator plus the denominator for the area of the bounded regular hexagon when expressed as the square root of a reduced fraction, simply find $k$, the denominator of that reduced fraction. Find all square numbers $ S_1$ and $ S_2$ such that $ S_1 - S_2 = k + 1986$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves a regular hexagon with side length 2, where each vertex is the center of a unit circle. Internal common tangents of circles centered at vertices two apart form a new regular hexagon. The distance between centers of circles $C_i$ and $C_{i+2}$ is $2\\\\sqrt{3}$. For two unit circles separated by this distance, the internal common tangents are analyzed. The distance from the origin (center of the original hexagon) to each tangent line (apothem of the new hexagon) is calculated as $\\\\sqrt{6}/3$. The area of the new hexagon is derived as $\\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{3}}{3}$, which equals $\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{16}{3}}$. Thus, $a = 16$ and $b = 3$, making $k = b = 3$. The problem specifies finding $k$, the denominator of the reduced fraction under the square root for the area.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
