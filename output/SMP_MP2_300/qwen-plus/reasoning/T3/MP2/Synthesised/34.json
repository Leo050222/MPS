  "math_problem": "You have a twig of length 1. You repeatedly do the following: select two points on the twig independently and uniformly at random, make cuts on these two points, and keep only the largest piece. After 2012 repetitions, what is the expected length of the remaining piece? Instead of computing the expected remaining length after many such cutting operations, simply find $k = a_1 + \\frac{133}{18}$, where $a_1$ is the expected length of the longest piece obtained from a unit-length twig in a single operation of selecting two uniform random points, cutting, and retaining the largest segment. Kevin starts with the vectors $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ and at each time step, he replaces one of the vectors with their sum. Find the cotangent of the minimum possible angle between the vectors after $k$ time steps.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute $a_1$, the expected length of the longest segment when cutting a unit twig at two random points. For two uniform random cuts, the expected length of the longest of the three segments is known to be $\\\\frac{11}{18}$. Thus, $a_1 = \\\\frac{11}{18}$. Then, $k = a_1 + \\\\frac{133}{18} = \\\\frac{11 + 133}{18} = \\\\frac{144}{18} = 8$.\\n\\nNext, consider Kevin's vector process. Starting with $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$, each step replaces one vector with their sum. The minimum angle between the vectors after $k$ steps corresponds to maximizing the dot product (since $\\\\cot\\\\theta = \\\\text{dot product}$ due to the determinant being 1). The dot product follows the Fibonacci sequence: after $k$ steps, it equals $F_{2k}$ where $F_n$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number. For $k=8$, $F_{16} = 987$. Thus, the cotangent of the minimum angle is 987.\",\n    \"answer\": \"987\"\n}",
