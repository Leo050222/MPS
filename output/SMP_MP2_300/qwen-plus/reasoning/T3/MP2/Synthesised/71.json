Instead of finding the total number of such subsets, simply find $k = N_5 - 8$, where $N_5$ is the number of non-empty subsets whose largest element is 5 and that satisfy the given condition. Find the number of ordered triples of nonnegative integers $(a, b, c)$ that satisfy $(ab+k)(bc+k)(ca+k)=84$.",

Subsets with largest element 5 are of the form $\\\\{5\\\\} \\\\cup T$ where $ T \\\\subseteq \\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\} $. There are $ 2^4 = 16 $ such subsets.
