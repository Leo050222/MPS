  "math_problem": "Find all prime numbers $p,q,r$ , such that $\\frac{p}{q}-\\frac{4}{r+1}=1$ Instead of finding all prime numbers $p,q,r$ satisfying the given equation, simply find $n = r + 2009$, where $r$ is the prime number such that $r + 1$ equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term. FemtoPravis is walking on an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard that wraps around at its edges (so squares on the left edge of the chessboard are adjacent to squares on the right edge, and similarly for the top and bottom edges). Each femtosecond, FemtoPravis moves in one of the four diagonal directions uniformly at random. After $n$ femtoseconds, what is the probability that FemtoPravis is at his original location?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine the value of $ n = r + 2009 $, where $ r $ is a prime number such that $ r + 1 $ equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term in the equation $ \\\\frac{p}{q} - \\\\frac{4}{r+1} = 1 $. The subtracted term is $ \\\\frac{4}{r+1} $, so its numerator is 4. Thus, $ r + 1 = 4 $, giving $ r = 3 $, which is a prime number. Therefore, $ n = 3 + 2009 = 2012 $.\\n\\nNext, we analyze FemtoPravis's movement on an $ 8 \\\\times 8 $ toroidal chessboard. Each move is in one of the four diagonal directions (NE, NW, SE, SW), each with equal probability $ \\\\frac{1}{4} $. After $ n = 2012 $ steps, we need the probability that FemtoPravis returns to the original position.\\n\\nThe movement can be modeled using Fourier analysis on the torus $ \\\\mathbb{Z}/8\\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}/8\\\\mathbb{Z} $. The key insight is that for large even $ t $, the probability of returning to the origin is dominated by the contributions from characters where the step distribution has magnitude 1. These characters correspond to $ (k, l) = (0, 0), (4, 4), (4, 0), (0, 4) $, each contributing 1 (since $ t = 2012 $ is even, $ (-1)^t = 1 $).\\n\\nThe sum of these contributions is 4, and the total number of characters is 64. Thus, the probability is $ \\\\frac{4}{64} = \\\\frac{1}{16} $. Other terms decay exponentially and are negligible for large $ t $.\", \"answer\": \"1/16\"}",
