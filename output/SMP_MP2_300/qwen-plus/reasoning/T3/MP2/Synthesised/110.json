  "math_problem": "Find all triples of primes $(p,q,r)$ satisfying $3p^{4}-5q^{4}-4r^{2}=26$. Instead of determining all triples of primes that satisfy the given Diophantine equation, simply find $m = r - 16$, where $r$ is the prime in the solution triple. Triangle $A B C$ has perimeter 1. Its three altitudes form the side lengths of a triangle. Find the set of all possible values of $\\min (A B, B C, C A)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we analyze the Diophantine equation $3p^4 - 5q^4 - 4r^2 = 26$ where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are primes. We test small prime values due to the rapid growth of fourth powers.\\n\\n- For $q = 3$, $5q^4 = 5 \\\\cdot 81 = 405$. Substituting into the equation gives $3p^4 - 4r^2 = 431$.\\n- Trying $p = 5$, $3p^4 = 3 \\\\cdot 625 = 1875$. Then $1875 - 431 = 1444 = 4r^2$, so $r^2 = 361$ and $r = 19$, which is prime.\\n- Verifying: $3(5)^4 - 5(3)^4 - 4(19)^2 = 1875 - 405 - 1444 = 26$, confirming the solution $(p, q, r) = (5, 3, 19)$.\\n\\nNo other small primes yield valid solutions. Thus, $r = 19$, and $m = r - 16 = 3$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
