  "math_problem": "Determine the positive real value of $x$ for which $$\\sqrt{2+A C+2 C x}+\\sqrt{A C-2+2 A x}=\\sqrt{2(A+C) x+2 A C}$$. Instead of determining the positive real number that equates the sum of the two specified square roots to the third square root, simply find $k = b + 5$, where $b$ is the value assumed by the inner expression of the second square root when the equation holds. Solve the equation\n\\[ 3^x - k^y = z^2. \\]\nin positive integers.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, analyze the given equation: \\n$$\\n\\\\sqrt{2 + AC + 2Cx} + \\\\sqrt{AC - 2 + 2Ax} = \\\\sqrt{2(A + C)x + 2AC}\\n$$\\nLet $ U = 2 + AC + 2Cx $, $ V = AC - 2 + 2Ax $, and $ T = 2(A + C)x + 2AC $. Squaring both sides gives:\\n$$\\nU + V + 2\\\\sqrt{UV} = T\\n$$\\nSince $ U + V = 2AC + 2(A + C)x = T $, this simplifies to $ 2\\\\sqrt{UV} = 0 $, so $ UV = 0 $. As $ U > 0 $ for positive $ x $, $ V = 0 $. Thus, the inner expression of the second square root is $ b = V = 0 $, so $ k = b + 5 = 5 $.\\n\\nNext, solve $ 3^x - 5^y = z^2 $ in positive integers. Testing small values:\\n- For $ y = 1 $, $ 3^x - 5 = z^2 $. When $ x = 2 $, $ 9 - 5 = 4 = 2^2 $, so $ (x, y, z) = (2, 1, 2) $ is a solution.\\n- For $ y \\\\geq 2 $, modular arithmetic and factorization show no other solutions exist. The only solution is $ z = 2 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2\"\n}",
