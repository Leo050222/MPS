  "math_problem": "Determine the number of integers $2 \\leq n \\leq 2016$ such that $n^{n}-1$ is divisible by $2,3,5,7$. Instead of determining the number of integers in the given range satisfying the specified modular congruence conditions, simply find $m = \\gcd(n,6) - 1$, where $\\gcd(n,6)$ is the greatest common divisor between such an integer $n$ and $6$, derived from the analysis that such $n$ must be coprime to the primes $2$ and $3$. Assume the quartic $x^{4}-a x^{3}+b x^{2}-a x+d=0$ has four real roots $m + \\frac{1}{2} \\leq x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4} \\leq 2$. Find the maximum possible value of $\\frac{\\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\\right)\\left(x_{1}+x_{3}\\right) x_{4}}{\\left(x_{4}+x_{2}\\right)\\left(x_{4}+x_{3}\\right) x_{1}}$ (over all valid choices of $\\left.a, b, d\\right)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires determining $ m = \\\\gcd(n, 6) - 1 $ where $ n $ satisfies $ n^n - 1 $ divisible by $ 2, 3, 5, 7 $. Analysis shows $ n $ must be coprime to $ 2 $ and $ 3 $, so $ \\\\gcd(n, 6) = 1 $, hence $ m = 0 $. The quartic equation has roots in $ [1/2, 2] $ due to $ m + 1/2 = 1/2 $. The quartic's symmetry (reciprocal roots) and constraints lead to analyzing the expression $ \\\\frac{(x_1 + x_2)(x_1 + x_3)x_4}{(x_4 + x_2)(x_4 + x_3)x_1} $. By testing valid root configurations (e.g., $ 1/2, 1, 1, 2 $), the maximum value occurs when roots are $ 1/2, 1, 2, 1 $, yielding $ \\\\frac{5}{4} $. This is confirmed via function analysis and valid quartic checks.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5/4\"\n}",
