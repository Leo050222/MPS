Instead of determining the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial, simply find \\(k = a_3 - 27\\), where \\(a_3\\) is the coefficient of \\(x^3\\).

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the coefficient $a_3$ of $x^3$ in the polynomial $P(x)$. Given $P(10) = 331633$ and $P(-10) = 273373$, we separate even and odd degree terms:\\n\\n- Adding $P(10) + P(-10)$ gives $2(a_0 + 100a_2 + 10000a_4 + \\\\cdots) = 605006$, so the even part is $302503$.\\n- Subtracting $P(-10)$ from $P(10)$ gives $2(10a_1 + 1000a_3 + \\\\cdots) = 58260$, so the odd part is $29130$.\\n\\nDividing the odd part by 10: $a_1 + 100a_3 + \\\\cdots = 2913$. Since coefficients are less than 100, $a_1 = 13$ and $a_3 = 29$ (as $100 \\\\times 29 = 2900$, leaving $a_1 = 13$). Thus, $k = a_3 - 27 = 2$.\\n\\nNext, find the largest integral value of $\\\\frac{P^2}{A}$ for a primitive right triangle (relatively prime sides). Primitive triples are $(m^2 - n^2, 2mn, m^2 + n^2)$ with $m > n$, coprime, not both odd. Perimeter $P = 2m(m + n)$, area $A = mn(m^2 - n^2)$. Then:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{P^2}{A} = \\\\frac{4m(m + n)}{n(m - n)}\\n$$\\nSetting $m = n + 1$ (since $m - n$ must be odd and divide 4), and $n$ dividing 4, valid $n$ values are 1, 2, 4:\\n- $n=1$: $\\\\frac{P^2}{A} = 24$\\n- $n=2$: $\\\\frac{P^2}{A} = 30$\\n- $n=4$: $\\\\frac{P^2}{A} = 45$\\n\\nThe largest integral value is 45.\",\n    \"answer\": \"45\"\n}",
