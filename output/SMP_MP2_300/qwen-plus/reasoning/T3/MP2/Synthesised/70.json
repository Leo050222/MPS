  "math_problem": "The coefficients of the polynomial \\(P(x)\\) are nonnegative integers, each less than 100. Given that \\(P(10)=331633\\) and \\(P(-10)=273373\\), compute \\(P(1)\\). Instead of determining the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial, simply find \\(k = a_3 - 27\\), where \\(a_3\\) is the coefficient of \\(x^3\\). Let $P$ and $A$ denote the perimeter and area respectively of a right triangle with relatively prime integer side-lengths. Find the largest possible integral value of $\\frac{P^{k}}{A}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The polynomial $P(x)$ has nonnegative integer coefficients less than 100. Given $P(10) = 331633$ and $P(-10) = 273373$, we analyze the even and odd parts of the polynomial. Adding and subtracting these values gives:\\n\\n- $P(10) + P(-10) = 2(a_0 + 100a_2 + 10000a_4 + \\\\cdots) = 605006 \\\\implies a_0 + 100a_2 + 10000a_4 + \\\\cdots = 302503$\\n- $P(10) - P(-10) = 2(10a_1 + 1000a_3 + 100000a_5 + \\\\cdots) = 58260 \\\\implies 10a_1 + 1000a_3 + 100000a_5 + \\\\cdots = 29130$\\n\\nConverting $302503$ to base 100 yields coefficients $a_0 = 3$, $a_2 = 25$, $a_4 = 30$. Converting $29130/10 = 2913$ to base 100 gives $a_1 = 13$, $a_3 = 29$. Thus, $a_3 = 29$, so $k = a_3 - 27 = 2$.\\n\\nFor the right triangle part, primitive Pythagorean triples are parameterized as $m^2 - n^2$, $2mn$, $m^2 + n^2$ with $m > n$, coprime, not both odd. The perimeter $P = 2m(m + n)$ and area $A = mn(m^2 - n^2)$. We compute $\\\\frac{P^2}{A} = \\\\frac{4m(m + n)}{n(m - n)}$. Analyzing integer values, the largest occurs for $m = 5$, $n = 4$ (sides 9, 40, 41), giving $\\\\frac{P^2}{A} = 45$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"45\"\n}",
