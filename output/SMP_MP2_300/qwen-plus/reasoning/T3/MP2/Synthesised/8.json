  "math_problem": "Let $\\omega$ be a fixed circle with radius 1, and let $B C$ be a fixed chord of $\\omega$ such that $B C=1$. The locus of the incenter of $A B C$ as $A$ varies along the circumference of $\\omega$ bounds a region $\\mathcal{R}$ in the plane. Find the area of $\\mathcal{R}$. Instead of finding the area of $\\mathcal{R}$, simply find $n = \\sin \\theta + \\frac{29}{2}$, where $\\theta$ is the acute angle at $A$ subtended by $BC$. You are given an unlimited supply of red, blue, and yellow cards to form a hand. Each card has a point value and your score is the sum of the point values of those cards. The point values are as follows: the value of each red card is 1 , the value of each blue card is equal to twice the number of red cards, and the value of each yellow card is equal to three times the number of blue cards. What is the maximum score you can get with $n$ cards?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $\\\\theta$, the acute angle at $A$ subtended by chord $BC$ in a unit circle. The chord length $BC = 1$ corresponds to a central angle of $60^\\\\circ$ (using $BC = 2R \\\\sin(\\\\alpha/2)$). The inscribed angle $\\\\theta$ over the minor arc $BC$ is half the central angle, so $\\\\theta = 30^\\\\circ$. Thus, $\\\\sin \\\\theta = \\\\frac{1}{2}$. Then $n = \\\\sin \\\\theta + \\\\frac{29}{2} = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{29}{2} = 15$.\\n\\nNext, maximize the score with $n = 15$ cards. Let $r$, $b$, $y$ be the counts of red, blue, and yellow cards ($r + b + y = 15$). The score is $S = r + 2rb + 3by$. Substituting $y = 15 - r - b$, $S = r(1 - b) + 45b - 3b^2$. For $b \\\\geq 2$, $S$ is maximized when $r = 0$ (since $1 - b < 0$), reducing $S$ to $3b(15 - b)$. This quadratic peaks at $b = 7.5$, so integer values $b = 7$ and $b = 8$ yield $S = 3 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 8 = 168$ and $3 \\\\cdot 8 \\\\cdot 7 = 168$. Testing all cases confirms $168$ is the maximum score.\",\n    \"answer\": \"168\"\n}",
