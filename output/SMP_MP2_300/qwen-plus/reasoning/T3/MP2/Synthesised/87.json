  "math_problem": "In a $k \\times k$ chessboard, a set $S$ of 25 cells that are in a $5 \\times 5$ square is chosen uniformly at random. The probability that there are more black squares than white squares in $S$ is $48\\%$. Find $k$. Instead of determining the dimension of the board, simply find $b = n - 3$, where $n$ is the number of possible starting positions along one dimension for the subsquare derived from the positional analysis of the board. Find all ordered pairs of integers $(x, y)$ such that $3^{x} 4^{y}=b^{x+y}+b^{2(x+y)-1}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the number of starting positions $ n $ for a $ 5 \\\\times 5 $ square on a $ k \\\\times k $ chessboard. The number of starting positions along one dimension is $ n = k - 4 $. The probability that a random $ 5 \\\\times 5 $ square has more black squares than white squares is 48%. For a $ 5 \\\\times 5 $ square, the number of black squares is 13 if the top-left corner is black (i.e., $ i + j $ even) and 12 otherwise. The probability of more black squares is the number of starting positions with $ i + j $ odd divided by $ n^2 $. Solving $ \\\\frac{n^2 - 1}{2n^2} = 0.48 $ gives $ n = 5 $. Thus, $ b = n - 3 = 2 $. Next, solve $ 3^x 4^y = 2^{x+y} + 2^{2(x+y)-1} $. Testing small integer values for $ x $ and $ y $, the valid solutions are $ (0, 1) $, $ (1, 1) $, and $ (2, 2) $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(0,1),(1,1),(2,2)\"\n}",
