  "math_problem": "Consider a sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ of integers, satisfying $a_1=1, a_2=2$ and $a_{n+1}$ is the largest prime divisor of $a_1+a_2+\\ldots+a_n$. Find $a_{100}$. Instead of determining the 100th term of the sequence, simply find $k = a_{99} - 51$, where $a_{99}$ is the 99th term of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$. If 5 points are placed in $\\mathbb{Z}^k$ at lattice points (i.e. points $(x_1, \\dots, x_k)$ where $x_1, \\dots, x_k$ are all integers) such that no three are collinear, then there are 10 triangles whose vertices are among these points. What is the minimum possible number of these triangles that have area greater than $1 / 2$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first analyze the sequence $\\\\{a_n\\\\}$ defined by $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 2$, and $a_{n+1}$ as the largest prime divisor of $S_n = a_1 + \\\\cdots + a_n$. Computing initial terms reveals a pattern:\\n\\n- $a_3 = 3$ (from $S_2 = 3$)\\n- $a_4 = a_5 = a_6 = 3$ (from sums $6, 9, 12$)\\n- $a_7 = a_8 = a_9 = a_{10} = 5$ (from sums $15, 20, 25, 30$)\\n- $a_{11} = \\\\cdots = a_{16} = 7$ (from sums $35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70$)\\n- Subsequent primes follow blocks of 6 terms each (e.g., $a_{17} = \\\\cdots = a_{22} = 11$, etc.).\\n\\nThe sequence progresses such that:\\n- Blocks for primes $3$ and $5$ have 4 terms each.\\n- Starting from prime $7$, each prime block has 6 terms.\\n\\nTracking cumulative indices:\\n- $n = 1$: $a_1 = 1$\\n- $n = 2$: $a_2 = 2$\\n- $n = 3$–$6$: $a_n = 3$\\n- $n = 7$–$10$: $a_n = 5$\\n- $n = 11$–$16$: $a_n = 7$\\n- $n = 17$–$22$: $a_n = 11$\\n- $\\\\vdots$\\n- $n = 95$–$100$: $a_n = 61$\\n\\nThus, $a_{99} = 61$, so $k = a_{99} - 51 = 10$.\\n\\nNext, consider 5 lattice points in $\\\\mathbb{Z}^{10}$ with no three collinear. There are $\\\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ triangles. The area of a triangle with lattice vertices is $\\\\frac{1}{2} |\\\\text{determinant}|$, where the determinant is an integer. Area $> \\\\frac{1}{2}$ iff the determinant $\\\\geq 2$.\\n\\nIn $\\\\mathbb{Z}^2$, the maximum number of triangles with area $\\\\frac{1}{2}$ (determinant $= 1$) among 5 non-collinear points is 6 (e.g., points $(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,3)$). Thus, the minimum number of triangles with area $> \\\\frac{1}{2}$ is $10 - 6 = 4$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4\"\n}",
