  "math_problem": "How many ways, without taking order into consideration, can 2002 be expressed as the sum of 3 positive integers (for instance, $1000+1000+2$ and $1000+2+1000$ are considered to be the same way)? Instead of determining the total number of unordered triples of positive integers that sum to the given total, simply find $l$, the terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends. Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer with exactly $(l + 2012)$ positive factors. What is the sum of the (not necessarily distinct) prime factors of $n$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing how many unordered triples of positive integers sum to 2002. The key is to consider the middle term $ b $ in the sorted triple $ (a, b, c) $ such that $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c $ and $ a + b + c = 2002 $. \\n\\n### Step 1: Determine the Range of Middle Addends\\n\\nFor a valid triple with $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c $, the middle term $ b $ must satisfy:\\n- $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c $\\n- $ a + b + c = 2002 $\\n\\nThis leads to two distinct cases for the middle addend $ b $:\\n\\n#### Case A: Two Equal Smaller Numbers ($ a = b < c $)\\nHere, $ 2b + c = 2002 $, and since $ c > b $, we have $ 2b < 2002 \\\\Rightarrow b < 667.333 $. Thus, $ b \\\\in [1, 667] $, forming an arithmetic sequence of length 667.\\n\\n#### Case B: Two Equal Larger Numbers ($ a < b = c $)\\nHere, $ a + 2b = 2002 $, and since $ a < b $, we have $ 2002 - 2b < b \\\\Rightarrow b > 667.333 $. Also, $ a \\\\geq 1 \\\\Rightarrow b \\\\leq 1000.5 $. So $ b \\\\in [668, 1000] $, forming an arithmetic sequence of length 333.\\n\\nSince 333 < 667, **Case B** is the shorter sequence. Its terminal term is **1000**, so $ l = 1000 $.\\n\\n### Step 2: Compute $ l + 2012 $\\n\\n$$\\nl + 2012 = 1000 + 2012 = 3012\\n$$\\n\\nWe now seek the smallest positive integer $ n $ with exactly **3012** positive divisors.\\n\\n### Step 3: Find the Smallest Integer with 3012 Divisors\\n\\nThe number of positive divisors function $ d(n) $ is multiplicative. If $ n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\\\cdots p_k^{e_k} $, then:\\n$$\\nd(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)\\\\cdots(e_k + 1)\\n$$\\n\\nFactorizing 3012:\\n$$\\n3012 = 2^2 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 251\\n$$\\n\\nTo minimize $ n $, we assign the largest exponents to the smallest primes. The optimal factorization of 3012 into four factors (to maximize the number of prime factors in $ n $) is:\\n$$\\n3012 = 251 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 2\\n$$\\n\\nThus, the exponents are:\\n$$\\ne_1 = 250,\\\\quad e_2 = 2,\\\\quad e_3 = 1,\\\\quad e_4 = 1\\n$$\\n\\nAssigning these to the smallest primes:\\n$$\\nn = 2^{250} \\\\cdot 3^2 \\\\cdot 5^1 \\\\cdot 7^1\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 4: Sum of Prime Factors (Not Necessarily Distinct)\\n\\nWe compute the sum of all prime factors, counting multiplicities:\\n- $ 2 $ appears 250 times: $ 2 \\\\times 250 = 500 $\\n- $ 3 $ appears 2 times: $ 3 \\\\times 2 = 6 $\\n- $ 5 $ appears 1 time: $ 5 \\\\times 1 = 5 $\\n- $ 7 $ appears 1 time: $ 7 \\\\times 1 = 7 $\\n\\nTotal:\\n$$\\n500 + 6 + 5 + 7 = 518\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"518\"}",
