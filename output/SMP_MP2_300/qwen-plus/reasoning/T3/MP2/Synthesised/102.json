  "math_problem": "Simplify: $2 \\sqrt{1.5+\\sqrt{2}}-(1.5+\\sqrt{2})$. Instead of determining the simplified value of the given algebraic expression, simply find $k = \\sqrt{4} - 1$, where $\\sqrt{4}$ is the rational component in the denested form of the nested square root derived from the structural analysis of the expression. Find a nonzero monic polynomial $P(x)$ with integer coefficients and minimal degree such that $P(k-\\sqrt[3]{2}+\\sqrt[3]{4})=0$. (A polynomial is called monic if its leading coefficient is 1.)",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding a monic polynomial with integer coefficients for $ k - \\\\sqrt[3]{2} + \\\\sqrt[3]{4} $, where $ k = \\\\sqrt{4} - 1 $. Since $ \\\\sqrt{4} = 2 $, we have $ k = 1 $. Thus, the target value is $ 1 - \\\\sqrt[3]{2} + \\\\sqrt[3]{4} $. Let $ \\\\beta = \\\\sqrt[3]{2} $, so $ \\\\beta^3 = 2 $ and $ \\\\sqrt[3]{4} = \\\\beta^2 $. Define $ \\\\alpha = 1 - \\\\beta + \\\\beta^2 $. To find the minimal polynomial of $ \\\\alpha $, express powers of $ \\\\alpha $ in terms of $ \\\\beta $ and use $ \\\\beta^3 = 2 $. Compute $ \\\\alpha^2 = 3\\\\beta^2 - 3 $ and $ \\\\alpha^3 = 9\\\\beta - 9 $. Solving for $ \\\\beta $ and $ \\\\beta^2 $ in terms of $ \\\\alpha $, substitute into $ \\\\beta^3 = 2 $ to derive the equation $ \\\\alpha^3 - 3\\\\alpha^2 + 9\\\\alpha - 9 = 0 $. This cubic polynomial is irreducible over $ \\\\mathbb{Q} $ (no rational roots via Rational Root Theorem), confirming it is the minimal monic polynomial with integer coefficients.\",\n    \"answer\": \"x^3 - 3x^2 + 9x - 9\"\n}",
