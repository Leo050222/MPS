  "math_problem": "Let $\\omega_{1}$ be a circle of radius 5, and let $\\omega_{2}$ be a circle of radius 2 whose center lies on $\\omega_{1}$. Let the two circles intersect at $A$ and $B$, and let the tangents to $\\omega_{2}$ at $A$ and $B$ intersect at $P$. If the area of $\\triangle ABP$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $b$ is square-free and $a, c$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a+10b+c$. Instead of computing the encoded integer from the parameters in the simplified expression for the area of $\\triangle ABP$, simply find $m = c - 22$, where $c$ is the denominator in that fractional expression derived from the geometric configuration of the circles and tangents. How many ways can you color the squares of a $2 \\times 2008$ grid in $m$ colors such that no two squares of the same color share an edge?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the area of triangle ABP. Circle ω₁ has radius 5, center O₁; ω₂ has radius 2, center O₂ on ω₁, so O₁O₂ = 5. Coordinates: O₁(0,0), O₂(5,0). Intersection points A and B lie on the radical axis x = 23/5. Solving, A(23/5, 4√6/5), B(23/5, -4√6/5). Tangents to ω₂ at A and B intersect at P(-5,0). Length AB = 8√6/5, height from P to AB is 48/5. Area = (1/2)(8√6/5)(48/5) = 192√6/25. Thus, c = 25, so m = c - 22 = 3.\\n\\nNext, count colorings of a 2×2008 grid with m = 3 colors, no adjacent same color. For a 2×n grid, the number of valid colorings follows the recurrence: for n=1, 3×2=6; each subsequent column has 3 valid extensions (verified via transition analysis). Thus, the number of colorings is 2×3ⁿ. For n=2008, this is 2×3²⁰⁰⁸.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2*3^2008\"\n}",
