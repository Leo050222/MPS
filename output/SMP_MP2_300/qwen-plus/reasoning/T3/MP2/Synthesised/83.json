  "math_problem": "Let $\\omega_{1}$ be a circle of radius 5, and let $\\omega_{2}$ be a circle of radius 2 whose center lies on $\\omega_{1}$. Let the two circles intersect at $A$ and $B$, and let the tangents to $\\omega_{2}$ at $A$ and $B$ intersect at $P$. If the area of $\\triangle ABP$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $b$ is square-free and $a, c$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a+10b+c$. Instead of computing the encoded integer from the parameters in the simplified expression for the area of $\\triangle ABP$, simply find $m = c - 22$, where $c$ is the denominator in that fractional expression derived from the geometric configuration of the circles and tangents. How many ways can you color the squares of a $2 \\times 2008$ grid in $m$ colors such that no two squares of the same color share an edge?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, we determine the area of triangle $\\\\triangle ABP$. The circle $\\\\omega_1$ has radius 5, and $\\\\omega_2$ has radius 2 with its center on $\\\\omega_1$, so the distance between centers $O_1O_2 = 5$. Using coordinate geometry, we place $O_1$ at $(0, 0)$ and $O_2$ at $(5, 0)$. The intersection points $A$ and $B$ lie on the vertical line $x = \\\\frac{23}{5}$, with $AB = \\\\frac{8\\\\sqrt{6}}{5}$. The tangents to $\\\\omega_2$ at $A$ and $B$ intersect at $P = (-5, 0)$. The height from $P$ to $AB$ is $\\\\frac{48}{5}$, so the area of $\\\\triangle ABP$ is $\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{8\\\\sqrt{6}}{5} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{48}{5} = \\\\frac{192\\\\sqrt{6}}{25}$. Thus, $c = 25$, and $m = c - 22 = 3$.\\n\\nNext, we compute the number of colorings of a $2 \\\\times 2008$ grid with $m = 3$ colors such that no two adjacent squares share the same color. For a $2 \\\\times n$ grid, the number of valid colorings follows the recurrence $f(n) = 6 \\\\cdot 3^{n-1}$, derived from the symmetry of the problem and the constraints on adjacent colors. For $n = 2008$, this gives $f(2008) = 6 \\\\cdot 3^{2007}$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6*3^2007\"\n}",
