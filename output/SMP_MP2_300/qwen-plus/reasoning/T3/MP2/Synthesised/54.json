  "math_problem": "Let $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ be a strictly increasing function such that $f(1)=1$ and $f(2n)f(2n+1)=9f(n)^{2}+3f(n)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Compute $f(137)$. Instead of computing the value of the function at the specified argument, simply find $k = f(68) - 730$, where $f(68)$ is the intermediate value of the function obtained by applying the recursive relation to reach the target argument. How many ways can the $k$ vertices of a three-dimensional cube be colored red and blue such that no two points connected by an edge are both red? Rotations and reflections of a given coloring are considered distinct.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, we determine the function $ f(n) $. Given $ f(1) = 1 $ and the recursive relation $ f(2n)f(2n+1) = 9f(n)^2 + 3f(n) $, we observe that $ f(n) $ corresponds to interpreting the binary representation of $ n $ as a base-3 number. For example, $ n = 68 $ in binary is $ 1000100 $, which as a base-3 number is $ 3^6 + 3^2 = 729 + 9 = 738 $. Thus, $ f(68) = 738 $, so $ k = f(68) - 730 = 8 $.\\n\\nNext, we count the number of valid colorings of the 8 vertices of a 3D cube (which has 8 vertices) where no two adjacent vertices are red. This is equivalent to counting the independent sets in the cube graph $ Q_3 $. The cube graph is bipartite with partitions of size 4 each. Independent sets include all subsets of one partition, all subsets of the other partition, and specific mixed sets. Summing all independent sets by size:\\n- Size 0: 1\\n- Size 1: 8\\n- Size 2: 16\\n- Size 3: 8\\n- Size 4: 2\\nTotal: $ 1 + 8 + 16 + 8 + 2 = 35 $. Rotations and reflections are considered distinct, so no symmetry reduction is needed.\",\n    \"answer\": \"35\"\n}",
