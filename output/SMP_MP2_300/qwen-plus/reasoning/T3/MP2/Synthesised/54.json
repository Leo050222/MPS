  "math_problem": "Let $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ be a strictly increasing function such that $f(1)=1$ and $f(2n)f(2n+1)=9f(n)^{2}+3f(n)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Compute $f(137)$. Instead of computing the value of the function at the specified argument, simply find $k = f(68) - 730$, where $f(68)$ is the intermediate value of the function obtained by applying the recursive relation to reach the target argument. How many ways can the $k$ vertices of a three-dimensional cube be colored red and blue such that no two points connected by an edge are both red? Rotations and reflections of a given coloring are considered distinct.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The function $ f: \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{N} $ is strictly increasing with $ f(1) = 1 $ and satisfies $ f(2n)f(2n+1) = 9f(n)^2 + 3f(n) $. By analyzing the recurrence, we find that $ f(n) $ corresponds to interpreting the binary representation of $ n $ as a base-3 number. For $ n = 68 $, its binary representation is $ 1000100 $, which in base-3 equals $ 3^6 + 3^2 = 729 + 9 = 738 $. Thus, $ k = f(68) - 730 = 8 $. The problem then asks for the number of valid colorings of the 8 vertices of a cube (since $ k = 8 $) where no two adjacent vertices are red. This is equivalent to counting the number of independent sets in the cube graph $ Q_3 $. The cube graph has 8 vertices and is bipartite. Using known results or direct enumeration, the number of independent sets in $ Q_3 $ is 35. Since rotations and reflections are considered distinct, all colorings are counted individually.\",\n    \"answer\": \"35\"\n}",
