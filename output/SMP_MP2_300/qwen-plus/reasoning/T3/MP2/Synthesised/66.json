  "math_problem": "For how many positive integers $a$ does the polynomial $x^{2}-a x+a$ have an integer root? Instead of determining the number of positive integers equal to both the sum and product of some pair of integers, simply find $k$, that number plus 42. Is it possible to cover a $13\\times 13$ chessboard with $k$ pieces of dimensions $4\\times 1$ such that only the central square of the chessboard remains uncovered?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the number of positive integers $a$ such that $x^2 - ax + a$ has an integer root. Let $r$ be an integer root. Then $r^2 - ar + a = 0 \\\\implies a = \\\\frac{r^2}{r - 1}$. For $a$ to be a positive integer, $r - 1$ must divide $r^2$. Rewriting $a = r + 1 + \\\\frac{1}{r - 1}$, $\\\\frac{1}{r - 1}$ must be an integer, so $r - 1 = \\\\pm 1$. \\n\\n- $r - 1 = 1 \\\\implies r = 2 \\\\implies a = 4$ (valid).\\n- $r - 1 = -1 \\\\implies r = 0 \\\\implies a = 0$ (invalid, not positive).\\n\\nNo other integer values of $r$ yield positive integer $a$. Thus, there is **1** such $a$. Then $k = 1 + 42 = 43$.\\n\\nNext, check if a $13 \\\\times 13$ chessboard (169 squares) can be covered with 43 $4 \\\\times 1$ tiles, leaving only the central square uncovered. The uncovered area is $169 - 1 = 168$ squares. Each tile covers 4 squares, so $43 \\\\times 4 = 172$, which exceeds 168. Since the total area to cover (168) requires exactly $168 / 4 = 42$ tiles, using 43 tiles is impossible due to area mismatch.\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\"\n}",
