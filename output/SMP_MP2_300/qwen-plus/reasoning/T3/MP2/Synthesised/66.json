  "math_problem": "For how many positive integers $a$ does the polynomial $x^{2}-a x+a$ have an integer root? Instead of determining the number of positive integers equal to both the sum and product of some pair of integers, simply find $k$, that number plus 42. Is it possible to cover a $13\\times 13$ chessboard with $k$ pieces of dimensions $4\\times 1$ such that only the central square of the chessboard remains uncovered?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the number of positive integers $a$ such that $x^2 - ax + a$ has an integer root. Let $r$ be an integer root, then $r^2 - ar + a = 0$, leading to $a = \\\\frac{r^2}{r - 1}$. For $a$ to be a positive integer, $r - 1$ must divide $r^2$. Simplifying, $\\\\frac{r^2}{r - 1} = r + 1 + \\\\frac{1}{r - 1}$, so $r - 1$ must divide 1. The divisors of 1 are $\\\\pm 1$, giving $r = 2$ (yielding $a = 4$) or $r = 0$ (yielding $a = 0$, invalid as $a$ must be positive). Thus, only $a = 4$ is valid, so the count is 1. Then $k = 1 + 42 = 43$.\\n\\nNext, check if a $13 \\\\times 13$ chessboard (169 squares) can be covered with 43 $4 \\\\times 1$ tiles leaving only the central square uncovered. The covered squares would need to be $169 - 1 = 168$. However, 43 tiles cover $43 \\\\times 4 = 172$ squares, which exceeds 168. Since tiling requires non-overlapping coverage, this is impossible due to the area mismatch. Additionally, coloring arguments confirm the impossibility (e.g., modulo 4 color counts show inconsistencies).\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\"\n}",
