  "math_problem": "In the game of Galactic Dominion, players compete to amass cards, each of which is worth a certain number of points. Say you are playing a version of this game with only two kinds of cards, planet cards and hegemon cards. Each planet card is worth 2010 points, and each hegemon card is worth four points per planet card held. You start with no planet cards and no hegemon cards, and, on each turn, starting at turn one, you take either a planet card or a hegemon card, whichever is worth more points given the hand you currently hold. Define a sequence \\(\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}\\) for all positive integers \\(n\\) by setting \\(a_{n}\\) to be 0 if on turn \\(n\\) you take a planet card and 1 if you take a hegemon card. What is the smallest value of \\(N\\) such that the sequence \\(a_{N}, a_{N+1}, \\ldots\\) is necessarily periodic (meaning that there is a positive integer \\(k\\) such that \\(a_{n+k}=a_{n}\\) for all \\(n \\geq N\\)) ? Instead of determining the minimal index from which the tail of the sequence is periodic, simply find \\(k = a_{502} + 9\\), where \\(a_{502}\\) is the term of the sequence at position 502 derived from the game's decision rules. Two positive rational numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), when written in lowest terms, have the property that the sum of their numerators is \\(k\\) and the sum of their denominators is 10. What is the largest possible value of \\(x+y\\)?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the game mechanics of Galactic Dominion. Each turn, a player chooses between taking a planet card (worth 2010 points) or a hegemon card (worth 4 times the number of planet cards currently held). The sequence $ \\\\{a_n\\\\} $ is defined such that $ a_n = 0 $ if a planet card is taken on turn $ n $, and $ a_n = 1 $ if a hegemon card is taken.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine $ a_{502} $\\n\\nLet $ p $ be the number of planet cards taken before turn $ n $. On turn $ n $, the value of a hegemon card is $ 4p $, and the value of a planet card is always 2010. A player will take a planet card if $ 4p < 2010 $, i.e., when $ p < 502.5 $. Therefore:\\n\\n- For $ p \\\\leq 502 $, the player takes a planet card.\\n- At $ p = 503 $, the value of a hegemon card becomes $ 4 \\\\times 503 = 2012 > 2010 $, so the player starts taking hegemon cards from then on.\\n\\nThis means:\\n- Turns 1 through 503: all planet cards are taken → $ a_n = 0 $\\n- Starting at turn 504: all hegemon cards are taken → $ a_n = 1 $\\n\\nThus, $ a_{502} = 0 $, since it's within the range where planet cards are still more valuable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Compute $ k = a_{502} + 9 $\\n\\n$$\\nk = 0 + 9 = 9\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Solve for the Largest Possible Value of $ x + y $\\n\\nWe are given two positive rational numbers $ x = \\\\frac{a}{b} $ and $ y = \\\\frac{c}{d} $ in lowest terms such that:\\n\\n- $ a + c = 9 $\\n- $ b + d = 10 $\\n\\nWe aim to **maximize** $ x + y = \\\\frac{a}{b} + \\\\frac{c}{d} $.\\n\\nLet’s consider all valid combinations of $ (a, b) $ and $ (c, d) $ satisfying the constraints and ensuring both fractions are in lowest terms.\\n\\n#### Key Insight:\\nTo maximize $ x + y $, we want one of the fractions to be as large as possible (i.e., an integer), while the other is small but positive. This happens when one denominator is 1 (making the fraction an integer), and the other is large.\\n\\nTry:\\n- $ x = \\\\frac{8}{1} $, $ y = \\\\frac{1}{9} $\\n  - Numerators: $ 8 + 1 = 9 $\\n  - Denominators: $ 1 + 9 = 10 $\\n  - Both in lowest terms\\n  - Sum: $ \\\\frac{8}{1} + \\\\frac{1}{9} = \\\\frac{73}{9} $\\n\\nOther combinations yield smaller sums (e.g., $ \\\\frac{7}{1} + \\\\frac{2}{9} = \\\\frac{65}{9} $, etc.).\\n\\nHence, the **maximum possible value** of $ x + y $ is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{73}{9}\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"73/9\"}",
