  "math_problem": "Tetrahedron $A B C D$ with volume 1 is inscribed in circumsphere $\\omega$ such that $A B=A C=A D=2$ and $B C \\cdot C D \\cdot D B=16$. Find the radius of $\\omega$. Instead of determining the circumradius of the sphere containing all four vertices, simply find $\\delta = AX - \\frac{7}{10}$, where $AX$ is the altitude from vertex $A$ to the plane of face $BCD$. In the Cartesian plane, let $A=(0,0)$, $B=(200,100)$, and $C=(30,330)$. Compute the number of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of integers so that $\\left(x+\\delta, y+\\delta\\right)$ is in the interior of triangle $A B C$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main parts: finding $\\\\delta$ and then using it to count integer lattice points.\\n\\n**Part 1: Finding $\\\\delta$**\\n\\nGiven tetrahedron $ABCD$ with volume 1, $AB = AC = AD = 2$, and $BC \\\\cdot CD \\\\cdot DB = 16$:\\n- The volume formula gives $1 = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\cdot \\\\text{Area}(BCD) \\\\cdot AX$, so $\\\\text{Area}(BCD) = \\\\frac{3}{AX}$.\\n- Since $AB = AC = AD$, the foot $X$ of the altitude from $A$ to plane $BCD$ is the circumcenter of $\\\\triangle BCD$. Let $r$ be the circumradius of $\\\\triangle BCD$. Then $r^2 + AX^2 = AB^2 = 4$.\\n- For $\\\\triangle BCD$, the circumradius formula gives $r = \\\\frac{BC \\\\cdot CD \\\\cdot DB}{4 \\\\cdot \\\\text{Area}(BCD)} = \\\\frac{16}{4 \\\\cdot \\\\text{Area}(BCD)} = \\\\frac{4}{\\\\text{Area}(BCD)}$. Substituting $\\\\text{Area}(BCD) = \\\\frac{3}{AX}$, we get $r = \\\\frac{4AX}{3}$.\\n- Substituting $r$ into $r^2 + AX^2 = 4$: $\\\\left(\\\\frac{4AX}{3}\\\\right)^2 + AX^2 = 4 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{25AX^2}{9} = 4 \\\\Rightarrow AX^2 = \\\\frac{36}{25} \\\\Rightarrow AX = \\\\frac{6}{5}$.\\n- Thus, $\\\\delta = AX - \\\\frac{7}{10} = \\\\frac{6}{5} - \\\\frac{7}{10} = \\\\frac{1}{2}$.\\n\\n**Part 2: Counting Integer Pairs**\\n\\nGiven $A = (0,0)$, $B = (200,100)$, $C = (30,330)$, and $\\\\delta = \\\\frac{1}{2}$, we need to count integer pairs $(x, y)$ such that $(x + \\\\frac{1}{2}, y + \\\\frac{1}{2})$ lies in the interior of $\\\\triangle ABC$.\\n- This is equivalent to counting half-integer points $(u, v) = (x + \\\\frac{1}{2}, y + \\\\frac{1}{2})$ strictly inside $\\\\triangle ABC$.\\n- The area of $\\\\triangle ABC$ is calculated via the shoelace formula: $\\\\text{Area} = \\\\frac{1}{2} |0 \\\\cdot 100 + 200 \\\\cdot 330 + 30 \\\\cdot 0 - (0 \\\\cdot 200 + 100 \\\\cdot 30 + 330 \\\\cdot 0)| = 31500$.\\n- For a polygon with integer coordinates, the number of half-integer points strictly inside equals the area of the polygon. This is because each unit square contributes exactly one half-integer point (its center), and the area corresponds to the count of such centers inside the polygon.\\n- Thus, the number of integer pairs $(x, y)$ is equal to the area of $\\\\triangle ABC$, which is $31500$.\", \"answer\": \"31500\"}",
