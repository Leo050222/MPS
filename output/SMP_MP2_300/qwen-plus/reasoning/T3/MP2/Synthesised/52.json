  "math_problem": "The country of HMMTLand has 8 cities. Its government decides to construct several two-way roads between pairs of distinct cities. After they finish construction, it turns out that each city can reach exactly 3 other cities via a single road, and from any pair of distinct cities, either exactly 0 or 2 other cities can be reached from both cities by a single road. Compute the number of ways HMMTLand could have constructed the roads. Instead of computing the total number of possible road constructions satisfying the conditions, simply find $N$, where $N$ is the number of connected road constructions satisfying the conditions. A real number $x$ is chosen uniformly at random from the interval $(0,10)$. Compute the probability that $\\sqrt{x}$, $\\sqrt{x+(N-833)}$, and $\\sqrt{10-x}$ are the side lengths of a non-degenerate triangle.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main parts: determining the number of connected road constructions (graphs) satisfying specific conditions, and then using that number to compute a probability involving triangle inequalities.\\n\\n**Part 1: Finding N**\\n\\nThe problem describes a 3-regular graph (each vertex has degree 3) with 8 vertices, where any two distinct vertices have either 0 or 2 common neighbors. This is characteristic of the 3-dimensional cube graph (Q3), which is bipartite, triangle-free, and has the required common neighbor properties. \\n\\n- The cube graph Q3 is the only connected 3-regular graph on 8 vertices satisfying the given conditions. \\n- The number of labeled graphs isomorphic to Q3 is calculated by dividing the total number of vertex labelings (8!) by the size of the automorphism group of Q3 (48). \\n- Calculation: $ \\\\frac{8!}{48} = \\\\frac{40320}{48} = 840 $. \\n- Thus, $ N = 840 $.\\n\\n**Part 2: Computing the Probability**\\n\\nGiven $ N = 840 $, we compute $ N - 833 = 7 $. The side lengths of the triangle are $ \\\\sqrt{x} $, $ \\\\sqrt{x + 7} $, and $ \\\\sqrt{10 - x} $ for $ x \\\\in (0, 10) $.\\n\\nFor a non-degenerate triangle, the strict triangle inequalities must hold:\\n1. $ \\\\sqrt{x} + \\\\sqrt{x + 7} > \\\\sqrt{10 - x} $\\n2. $ \\\\sqrt{x} + \\\\sqrt{10 - x} > \\\\sqrt{x + 7} $\\n3. $ \\\\sqrt{x + 7} + \\\\sqrt{10 - x} > \\\\sqrt{x} $ (always true since $ \\\\sqrt{x + 7} > \\\\sqrt{x} $)\\n\\nSolving the inequalities:\\n- Inequality 1 holds for $ x \\\\in (0.2, 10) $.\\n- Inequality 2 holds for $ x \\\\in (0, 9) $.\\n- Intersection of valid intervals: $ x \\\\in (0.2, 9) $.\\n\\nThe length of the valid interval is $ 9 - 0.2 = 8.8 $, and the total interval length is 10. The probability is $ \\\\frac{8.8}{10} = \\\\frac{22}{25} $.\", \"answer\": \"22/25\"}",
