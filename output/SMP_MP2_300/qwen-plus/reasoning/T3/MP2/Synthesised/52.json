  "math_problem": "The country of HMMTLand has 8 cities. Its government decides to construct several two-way roads between pairs of distinct cities. After they finish construction, it turns out that each city can reach exactly 3 other cities via a single road, and from any pair of distinct cities, either exactly 0 or 2 other cities can be reached from both cities by a single road. Compute the number of ways HMMTLand could have constructed the roads. Instead of computing the total number of possible road constructions satisfying the conditions, simply find $N$, where $N$ is the number of connected road constructions satisfying the conditions. A real number $x$ is chosen uniformly at random from the interval $(0,10)$. Compute the probability that $\\sqrt{x}$, $\\sqrt{x+(N-833)}$, and $\\sqrt{10-x}$ are the side lengths of a non-degenerate triangle.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main parts: determining $ N $, the number of connected road constructions (graphs) satisfying specific conditions, and then computing a probability based on $ N $.\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine $ N $\\n\\nThe problem describes an 8-vertex graph where:\\n- Each vertex has degree 3 (3-regular).\\n- For any pair of distinct vertices, the number of common neighbors is either 0 or 2.\\n\\nThis corresponds to a **labeled connected 3-regular graph** on 8 vertices with the given common neighbor condition. The only such graph is the **cube graph $ Q_3 $** (the 3-dimensional hypercube), which is the unique connected 3-regular graph on 8 vertices satisfying the condition.\\n\\nTo count the number of **labeled graphs** isomorphic to $ Q_3 $:\\n- The automorphism group of $ Q_3 $ has size 48 (permutations of coordinates and bit flips).\\n- The number of labeled graphs isomorphic to $ Q_3 $ is $ \\\\frac{8!}{|\\\\text{Aut}(Q_3)|} = \\\\frac{40320}{48} = 840 $.\\n\\nThus, $ N = 840 $.\\n\\n### Step 2: Compute the Probability\\n\\nGiven $ N = 840 $, we compute $ N - 833 = 7 $. The problem asks for the probability that $ \\\\sqrt{x} $, $ \\\\sqrt{x + 7} $, and $ \\\\sqrt{10 - x} $ form a non-degenerate triangle for $ x \\\\in (0, 10) $.\\n\\nFor three lengths $ a, b, c $ to form a non-degenerate triangle, the triangle inequalities must hold strictly:\\n1. $ a + b > c $\\n2. $ a + c > b $\\n3. $ b + c > a $\\n\\nLet $ a = \\\\sqrt{x} $, $ b = \\\\sqrt{x + 7} $, $ c = \\\\sqrt{10 - x} $. Since $ b > a $ and $ c > 0 $, the third inequality $ b + c > a $ always holds. The critical inequalities are:\\n\\n- **$ a + c > b $**: $ \\\\sqrt{x} + \\\\sqrt{10 - x} > \\\\sqrt{x + 7} $\\n  - Holds for $ x < 9 $.\\n- **$ a + b > c $**: $ \\\\sqrt{x} + \\\\sqrt{x + 7} > \\\\sqrt{10 - x} $\\n  - Holds for $ x > 0.2 $.\\n\\nCombining these, the valid interval is $ (0.2, 9) $, with length $ 8.8 $. The total interval length is 10, so the probability is $ \\\\frac{8.8}{10} = \\\\frac{22}{25} $.\", \"answer\": \"0.88\"}",
