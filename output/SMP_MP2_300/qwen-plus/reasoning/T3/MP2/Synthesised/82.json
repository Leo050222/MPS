  "math_problem": "A point $(x, y)$ is selected uniformly at random from the unit square $S=\\{(x, y) \\mid 0 \\leq x \\leq 1,0 \\leq y \\leq 1\\}$. If the probability that $(3x+2y, x+4y)$ is in $S$ is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a+b$. Instead of computing the numerical identifier from the fractional probability that the transformed point remains within the unit square, simply find $k=$ area$(R) + 1553/120$, where area$(R)$ is the measure of the subset of the unit square on which both components of the linear transformation are at most 1. In bridge, a standard 52-card deck is dealt in the usual way to 4 players. By convention, each hand is assigned a number of \"points\" based on the formula $$4 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~A} \\text {'s })+3 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~K} \\text {'s })+2 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{Q} \\text {'s })+1 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~J} \\text {'s })$$ Given that a particular hand has exactly 4 cards that are A, K, Q, or J, find the probability that its point value is $k$ or higher.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine the area of the region $ R $ within the unit square where the transformed point $(3x + 2y, x + 4y)$ remains in the unit square. This requires solving the inequalities $ 3x + 2y \\\\leq 1 $ and $ x + 4y \\\\leq 1 $ with $ x, y \\\\geq 0 $. The vertices of the region $ R $ are found to be $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1/4)$, $(1/5, 1/5)$, and $(1/3, 0)$. Using the shoelace formula, the area of $ R $ is calculated as $ \\\\frac{7}{120} $. Then, $ k = \\\\text{area}(R) + \\\\frac{1553}{120} = \\\\frac{7}{120} + \\\\frac{1553}{120} = \\\\frac{1560}{120} = 13 $.\\n\\nNext, we consider the bridge problem. A hand has exactly 4 honor cards (A, K, Q, J), and we need the probability that its point value is at least $ k = 13 $. The point value is computed as $ 4 \\\\times \\\\text{Aces} + 3 \\\\times \\\\text{Kings} + 2 \\\\times \\\\text{Queens} + 1 \\\\times \\\\text{Jacks} $. We enumerate all combinations of 4 honor cards that yield a point value $ \\\\geq 13 $:\\n\\n- **4 Aces**: 1 combination (point value 16)\\n- **3 Aces + 1 King**: 16 combinations (15 points)\\n- **3 Aces + 1 Queen**: 16 combinations (14 points)\\n- **3 Aces + 1 Jack**: 16 combinations (13 points)\\n- **3 Kings + 1 Ace**: 16 combinations (13 points)\\n- **2 Aces + 2 Kings**: 36 combinations (14 points)\\n- **2 Aces + 1 King + 1 Queen**: 96 combinations (13 points)\\n\\nTotal favorable combinations: $ 1 + 16 \\\\times 4 + 36 + 96 = 197 $. The total number of ways to choose 4 honor cards from 16 is $ \\\\binom{16}{4} = 1820 $. Thus, the probability is $ \\\\frac{197}{1820} $, where 197 and 1820 are coprime.\",\n    \"answer\": \"197/1820\"\n}",
