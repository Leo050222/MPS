  "math_problem": "Let $a, b$ be positive reals with $a>b>\\frac{1}{2} a$. Place two squares of side lengths $a, b$ next to each other, such that the larger square has lower left corner at $(0,0)$ and the smaller square has lower left corner at $(a, 0)$. Draw the line passing through $(0, a)$ and $(a+b, 0)$. The region in the two squares lying above the line has area 2013. If $(a, b)$ is the unique pair maximizing $a+b$, compute $\\frac{a}{b}$. Instead of computing $\\frac{a}{b}$ for the unique pair maximizing $a + b$, simply find $\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is the value of $\\frac{(a + b)^2}{a^2 - a b + 2 b^2}$ for that pair. Find the real solution(s) to the equation $(x+y)^{\\lambda - 2/7}=(x+1)(y-1)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the equation of the line through (0, a) and (a + b, 0), which is y = -a/(a + b)x + a. Calculate the area above this line within the two squares. For the first square (0 ≤ x ≤ a), the area above the line is the integral of (a - y_line) dx, resulting in a³/(2(a + b)). For the second square (a ≤ x ≤ a + b), the area above the line is the square's area minus the area under the line, giving b²(a + 2b)/(2(a + b)). Summing these areas simplifies to (a² - ab + 2b²)/2 = 2013, so a² - ab + 2b² = 4026.\\n\\nTo maximize a + b under this constraint, let S = a + b. Substituting a = S - b into the constraint yields a quadratic in b. The maximum S occurs when the discriminant is zero, leading to S² = (16 × 4026)/7. Thus, λ = S² / 4026 = 16/7.\\n\\nNext, solve (x + y)^{λ - 2/7} = (x + 1)(y - 1). Since λ - 2/7 = 2, the equation becomes (x + y)² = (x + 1)(y - 1). Expanding and rearranging gives x² + xy + y² + x - y + 1 = 0. Treating this as a quadratic in x, the discriminant is -3(y - 1)², which is non-negative only when y = 1. Substituting y = 1 yields x = -1. The only real solution is (-1, 1).\",\n    \"answer\": \"(-1, 1)\"\n}",
