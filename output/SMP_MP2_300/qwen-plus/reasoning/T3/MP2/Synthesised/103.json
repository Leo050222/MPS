  "math_problem": "A person starts at position (0,0,0) in the space {0,1}^3. Each minute, one of the three coordinates is chosen uniformly at random and flipped (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0). After an even number of minutes, the position always has an even number of 1's. In terms of $k$, for $k>0$ how likely is he to be back where he started after $2 k$ minutes? Instead of determining the return probability as a function of $k$, simply find $m = q_0 + 9/4$, where $q_0$ is the initial deviation of the return probability from its limiting value derived from the recurrence relation for returns to the origin. Compute $\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{2 \\sin \\theta + m \\cos \\theta - m}{13 \\cos \\theta - 5} \\,\\mathrm{d} \\theta$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves a random walk on the 3-dimensional hypercube {0,1}^3 starting at (0,0,0). Each minute, a coordinate is flipped uniformly at random. After even steps, the position has an even number of 1's. The return probability to the origin after 2k steps is derived using a recurrence relation.\\n\\nThe state space for even steps consists of 4 states: 1 with 0 ones (origin) and 3 with 2 ones. The transition matrix for even steps has eigenvalues 1 and 1/9. Solving the recurrence relation for the return probability $ c_k $ gives:\\n$$\\nc_k = \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{9}\\\\right)^k\\n$$\\nThe limiting value as $ k \\\\to \\\\infty $ is $ \\\\frac{1}{4} $. The initial deviation $ q_0 $ is the coefficient of the transient term, $ q_0 = \\\\frac{3}{4} $.
