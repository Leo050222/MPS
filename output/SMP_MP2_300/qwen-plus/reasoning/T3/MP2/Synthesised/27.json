  "math_problem": "A tightrope walker stands in the center of a rope of length 32 meters. Every minute she walks forward one meter with probability $3 / 4$ and backward one meter with probability $1 / 4$. What is the probability that she reaches the end in front of her before the end behind her? Instead of computing the probability of reaching the forward end before the backward end in this biased random walk on a line, simply find $k = r + 2/3$, where $r$ is the ratio of the backward probability to the forward probability. Sam spends his days walking around the following $2 \\times 2$ grid of squares. Say that two squares are adjacent if they share a side. He starts at the square labeled $k$ and every second walks to an adjacent square. How many paths can Sam take so that the sum of the numbers on every square he visits in his path is equal to 20 (not counting the square he started on)?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the value of $ k $. The ratio $ r $ of backward probability to forward probability is $ \\\\frac{1/4}{3/4} = \\\\frac{1}{3} $. Thus, $ k = r + \\\\frac{2}{3} = \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{2}{3} = 1 $. Sam starts at square labeled $ k = 1 $ on a $ 2 \\\\times 2 $ grid assumed to have labels:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{cc}\\n1 & 2 \\\\\\\\\\n3 & 4\\n\\\\end{array}\\n$$\\n\\nAdjacent squares share sides. The problem requires counting paths where the sum of numbers on visited squares (excluding the start) equals 20. Paths are sequences of moves starting at 1, with each move to an adjacent square. The sum includes all squares after the first.\\n\\nKey observations:\\n- Odd steps (1st, 3rd, etc.) visit squares 2 or 3.\\n- Even steps (2nd, 4th, etc.) visit squares 1 or 4.\\n- For each path length $ m $, compute valid combinations of steps that sum to 20.\\n\\nValid path lengths $ m $ range from 6 to 13 (since smaller $ m $ can't reach sum 20, larger $ m $ exceed minimum sum). For each $ m $:\\n- Calculate possible combinations of 2/3 (odd steps) and 1/4 (even steps) that sum to 20.\\n- Count valid paths using combinatorics (choosing positions for specific values).\\n\\nResults per $ m $:\\n- $ m=6 $: 3 paths\\n- $ m=7 $: 13 paths\\n- $ m=8 $: 36 paths\\n- $ m=9 $: 46 paths\\n- $ m=10 $: 51 paths\\n- $ m=11 $: 25 paths\\n- $ m=12 $: 15 paths\\n- $ m=13 $: 1 path\\n\\nTotal paths: $ 3 + 13 + 36 + 46 + 51 + 25 + 15 + 1 = 190 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"190\"\n}",
