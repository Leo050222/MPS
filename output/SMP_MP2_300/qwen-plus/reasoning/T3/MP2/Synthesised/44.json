  "math_problem": "Let $k$ be the answer to this problem. The probability that an integer chosen uniformly at random from $\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$ is a multiple of 11 can be written as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing $100a + b$, simply find $d = \\gcd(a, b)$, where $\\frac{a}{b}$ is the reduced form of the probability. Suppose $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. Isabella and Vidur both fill up an $a \\times b$ table. Isabella fills it up with numbers $1,2, \\ldots, a b$, putting the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, b$ in the first row, $b+1, b+2, \\ldots, 2 b$ in the second row, and so on. Vidur fills it up like a multiplication table, putting $i j$ in the cell in row $i$ and column $j$. The sum of the numbers in Isabella's grid is $\\frac{a b (a b + d)}{2}$ and the sum of the numbers in Vidur's grid is $\\frac{a (a + d) b (b + d)}{4}$; the difference between these two quantities is 1200. Compute $a+b$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves finding $a + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are coprime positive integers derived from a probability condition and a grid sum difference. First, the probability that a random integer from $\\\\{1, 2, \\\\ldots, k\\\\}$ is a multiple of 11 is $\\\\frac{\\\\lfloor k/11 \\\\rfloor}{k}$, which reduces to $\\\\frac{a}{b}$ with $\\\\gcd(a, b) = 1$. Thus, $d = \\\\gcd(a, b) = 1$.\\n\\nNext, Isabella's grid sum is $\\\\frac{ab(ab + 1)}{2}$ (since $d = 1$) and Vidur's grid sum is $\\\\frac{a(a + 1)b(b + 1)}{4}$. The difference between these sums is given as 1200:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{ab(ab + 1)}{2} - \\\\frac{a(a + 1)b(b + 1)}{4} = 1200.\\n$$\\nSimplifying this equation:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{ab}{4} \\\\left[ 2(ab + 1) - (a + 1)(b + 1) \\\\right] = 1200 \\\\implies \\\\frac{ab(a - 1)(b - 1)}{4} = 1200 \\\\implies ab(a - 1)(b - 1) = 4800.\\n$$\\nWe need coprime integers $a, b$ such that $ab(a - 1)(b - 1) = 4800$. Testing factor pairs, we find $a = 5$, $b = 16$ (or vice versa) satisfies the equation:\\n$$\\n5 \\\\cdot 16 \\\\cdot 4 \\\\cdot 15 = 4800, \\\\quad \\\\gcd(5, 16) = 1.\\n$$\\nThe sum $a + b = 5 + 16 = 21$ is consistent with the problem's conditions, including the grid sum difference of 1200. The self-referential $k$ is irrelevant here because the problem explicitly redirects to using $d = 1$ and solving for $a + b$ directly.\",\n    \"answer\": \"21\"\n}",
