  "math_problem": "Let $k$ be the answer to this problem. The probability that an integer chosen uniformly at random from $\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$ is a multiple of 11 can be written as $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing $100a + b$, simply find $d = \\gcd(a, b)$, where $\\frac{a}{b}$ is the reduced form of the probability. Suppose $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. Isabella and Vidur both fill up an $a \\times b$ table. Isabella fills it up with numbers $1,2, \\ldots, a b$, putting the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, b$ in the first row, $b+1, b+2, \\ldots, 2 b$ in the second row, and so on. Vidur fills it up like a multiplication table, putting $i j$ in the cell in row $i$ and column $j$. The sum of the numbers in Isabella's grid is $\\frac{a b (a b + d)}{2}$ and the sum of the numbers in Vidur's grid is $\\frac{a (a + d) b (b + d)}{4}$; the difference between these two quantities is 1200. Compute $a+b$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding $a + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that the difference between the sums of Isabella's and Vidur's grids is 1200. The sum of Isabella's grid (filled with numbers $1$ to $ab$) is $\\\\frac{ab(ab + 1)}{2}$, and Vidur's grid (multiplication table) sum is $\\\\frac{a(a + 1)b(b + 1)}{4}$. The difference equation simplifies to $ab(a - 1)(b - 1) = 4800$. Factoring this, we find $x = a - 1$ and $y = b - 1$ such that $xy(x + 1)(y + 1) = 4800$. Testing products of consecutive integers, the valid pairs are $(x, y) = (4, 15)$ or $(15, 4)$, leading to $(a, b) = (5, 16)$ or $(16, 5)$. Thus, $a + b = 21$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"21\"\n}",
