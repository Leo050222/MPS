  "math_problem": "A fat coin is one which, when tossed, has a $2 / 5$ probability of being heads, $2 / 5$ of being tails, and $1 / 5$ of landing on its edge. Mr. Fat starts at 0 on the real line. Every minute, he tosses a fat coin. If it's heads, he moves left, decreasing his coordinate by 1; if it's tails, he moves right, increasing his coordinate by 1. If the coin lands on its edge, he moves back to 0. If Mr. Fat does this ad infinitum, what fraction of his time will he spend at 0? Instead of finding the long-run proportion of time spent at the origin, simply find $r$, where $r$ is the factor less than 1 by which the stationary probability at distance $n$ from 0 relates to that at distance $n+1$, derived from the balance equations for the long-run proportions at non-zero positions. Let $Z$ be as in problem 15. Let $X$ be the greatest integer such that $|X Z| \\leq r + \\frac{9}{2}$. Find $X$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the stationary distribution of Mr. Fat's movement on the real line, governed by a \\\"fat coin\\\" with probabilities:\\n\\n- Heads (2/5): move left by 1\\n- Tails (2/5): move right by 1\\n- Edge (1/5): return to 0\\n\\nThis defines a Markov chain on the integers. Due to symmetry, the stationary distribution is symmetric about 0, so $ \\\\pi_n = \\\\pi_{-n} $ for all $ n $. Let $ \\\\pi_0 $ be the stationary probability at 0, and $ \\\\pi_n $ for $ n \\\\geq 1 $ represent the stationary probability at position $ n $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Deriving the Stationary Distribution\\n\\nWe consider the balance equations for the non-zero positions. For $ n \\\\geq 2 $, the recurrence relation from the balance equation is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\pi_n = \\\\frac{2}{5} \\\\pi_{n-1} + \\\\frac{2}{5} \\\\pi_{n+1}\\n$$\\n\\nAssuming a geometric decay $ \\\\pi_n = \\\\pi_1 r^{n-1} $, substituting into the recurrence gives:\\n\\n$$\\nr = \\\\frac{2}{5} + \\\\frac{2}{5} r^2 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad 2r^2 - 5r + 2 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nSolving this quadratic yields roots $ r = 2 $ and $ r = \\\\frac{1}{2} $. Since $ r < 1 $ is required for convergence, we take $ r = \\\\frac{1}{2} $.\\n\\nThus, the stationary probabilities decay geometrically as $ \\\\pi_n = \\\\pi_1 \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)^{n-1} $ for $ n \\\\geq 1 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Determining $ r $\\n\\nThe problem asks us to find $ r $, defined as the factor less than 1 such that the stationary probability at distance $ n $ relates to that at distance $ n+1 $ via $ \\\\pi_{n+1} = r \\\\pi_n $. From our derivation, this factor is:\\n\\n$$\\nr = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Interpreting $ Z $\\n\\nThe problem states: \\\"Let $ Z $ be as in problem 15.\\\" While problem 15 is not provided, it is reasonable to infer that it refers to the long-run proportion of time spent at 0, which is the stationary probability $ \\\\pi_0 $.\\n\\nFrom earlier analysis, using the total probability constraint and the geometric decay, we found:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\pi_0 = \\\\frac{1}{3}\\n$$\\n\\nHence, $ Z = \\\\frac{1}{3} $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Solving for $ X $\\n\\nWe are asked to find the greatest integer $ X $ such that:\\n\\n$$\\n|X Z| \\\\leq r + \\\\frac{9}{2}\\n$$\\n\\nSubstituting known values:\\n\\n- $ r = \\\\frac{1}{2} $\\n- $ Z = \\\\frac{1}{3} $\\n- $ r + \\\\frac{9}{2} = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{9}{2} = 5 $\\n\\nSo the inequality becomes:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left| X \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\right| \\\\leq 5 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad |X| \\\\leq 15\\n$$\\n\\nThe greatest integer satisfying this is:\\n\\n$$\\nX = 15\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"15\"}",
