If no two people are friends, all pairs are enemies. The condition states that for any two enemies, there is no common friend. Since there are no friends, this condition is vacuously true. Thus, there is exactly 1 such assignment (all enemies), so $ s = 1 $. Therefore, $ q = 1 - 1 = 0 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find the number of interior lattice points in the triangle with vertices $(0,99)$, $(5,100)$, and $(2003,500)$, use Pick's Theorem: $ A = I + \\\\frac{B}{2} - 1 $, where $ A $ is the area, $ I $ is interior points, and $ B $ is boundary points. The area via shoelace formula is $ 1 $. Boundary points $ B $: edges AB (gcd(5,1)=1 → 2 points), BC (gcd(1998,400)=2 → 3 points), CA (gcd(2003,401)=1 → 2 points). Total boundary points $ B = (2 + 3 + 2) - 3 = 4 $. Solving $ 1 = I + \\\\frac{4}{2} - 1 $ gives $ I = 0 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"0\"\n}",
