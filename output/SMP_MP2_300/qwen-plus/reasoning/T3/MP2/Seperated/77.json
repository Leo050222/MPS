In how many ways is this possible? Instead of determining the total number of valid friendship and enmity assignments among the five people, simply find $q = s - 1$, where $s$ is the number of such assignments in which no two people are friends."

For the all-enemies assignment, the condition holds vacuously because there are no friends, so no two enemies share a common friend. Thus, s = 1 (only one such assignment), so q = 1 - 1 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using Pick's Theorem, the area of the triangle is calculated via the shoelace formula as 1. The boundary lattice points (B) are found by computing gcd for each edge: AB has 2 points, BC has 3 points, CA has 2 points, totaling B = 4 (after adjusting for overlapping vertices). Applying Pick's Theorem: A = I + B/2 - 1 → 1 = I + 2 - 1 → I = 0. Thus, there are 0 interior lattice points.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"0\"\n}",
