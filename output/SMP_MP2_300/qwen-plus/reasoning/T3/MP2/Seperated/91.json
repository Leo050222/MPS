The distance from vertex $A$ to face $B C D$ can be written as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are positive integers, $b$ is square-free, and $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$. Find $100 a+10 b+c$. Instead of computing the encoded value $100a + 10b + c$ from the parameters of the distance expression, simply find $d = \\gcd(a, c) + 0$, where $a, b, c$ are the positive integers such that the distance is $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$ with $b$ square-free and $\\gcd(a, c)=1$."

Coordinates are assigned to vertices, and the z-coordinate of A (since BCD lies in the xy-plane) gives the height. The distance is found to be $\\\\frac{24\\\\sqrt{41}}{41}$, where $a=24$, $b=41$, $c=41$. Given $\\\\gcd(a, c)=1$, the problem asks for $d = \\\\gcd(a, c) + 0 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The expression $3x^2 + 10xy + 3y^2$ factors as $(3x + y)(x + 3y)$. For this product to be a prime power, both factors must be powers of the same prime. Analysis shows only prime $p=2$ works. Cases are:\\n- $x = y$: $x = 2^t$ for $t = 0$ to $10$ (11 pairs).\\n- $x > y$: 9 pairs where $x = 5 \\\\cdot 2^{k-3}$, $y = 2^{k-3}$ for $k = 3$ to $11$.\\n- $x < y$: 9 symmetric pairs.\\nTotal ordered pairs: $11 + 9 + 9 = 29$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"29\"\n}",
