  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Analyzing the equation modulo 3, we find that exactly two of the primes $a, b, c$ must be 3 (since their squares are 0 mod 3), and the third prime must not be 3 (its square is 1 mod 3) to satisfy $a^2 + b^2 + 16c^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 3$. Considering the case where $a = 3$, $b = 3$, and $c \\\\neq 3$, the equation simplifies to $16c^2 = 9k^2 - 17$. Testing small primes, $c = 2$ (the only even prime) satisfies the equation with $k = 3$. This is the unique solution derived from structural considerations (modulo 3 and factorization), as other cases for $c$ (e.g., $c = 3$) yield multiple solutions but do not align with the requirement of exactly one non-3 prime. Thus, $c = 2$, so $m = 2 + 288 = 290$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of trailing zeros in $n!$ is given by $\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n}{5} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n}{25} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n}{125} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n}{625} \\\\right\\\\rfloor$. Solving for $n$ such that this sum equals 290, we find $n = 1170$ is the smallest value where the count reaches 290 (verified by checking $n = 1165$ gives 289 zeros and $n = 1170$ gives 290).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"290\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1170\"\n}",
