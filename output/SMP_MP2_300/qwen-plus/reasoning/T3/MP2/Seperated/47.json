Since 8 = 2^3 and 125 = 5^3, their greatest common divisor is 1. Thus, d = 1 + 0 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find the largest n such that 2^n divides 7^2048 - 1, we analyze the 2-adic valuation v_2(7^2048 - 1). Using recursive factorization and observing the pattern for exponents of the form 2^k, we find that v_2(7^{2^k} - 1) = k + 3. For 2048 = 2^11, this gives v_2(7^2048 - 1) = 11 + 3 = 14. Hence, the largest n is 14.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"14\"\n}",
