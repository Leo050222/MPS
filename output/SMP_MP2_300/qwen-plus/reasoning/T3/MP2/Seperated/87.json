The probability that there are more black squares than white squares in $S$ is $48 \\%$. Find $k$. Instead of determining the dimension of the board, simply find $b = n - 3$, where $n$ is the number of possible starting positions along one dimension for the subsquare derived from the positional analysis of the board."

For a 5x5 square, the count of black squares is 13 if the top-left corner is black (a+b odd in this context due to probability < 50%), and 12 otherwise. The number of starting positions per dimension is m = k - 4. The probability of a+b odd is (m² - 1)/(2m²) = 0.48. Solving gives m² = 25, so m = 5. Thus, n = m = 5, and b = n - 3 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Rewrite the equation as 3^x 4^y = 2^{x+y} + 2^{2(x+y)-1}. Let s = x + y. The right side becomes 2^s(1 + 2^{s-1}). The left side must have 3^x dividing the odd part (1 + 2^{s-1}), leading to solving 3^x = 1 + 2^{s-1}. Known solutions via Mihăilescu's theorem are (x, s-1) = (1,1), (2,3), and checking x=0 gives another solution. Valid integer pairs are (0,1), (1,1), (2,2).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(0,1),(1,1),(2,2)\"\n}",
