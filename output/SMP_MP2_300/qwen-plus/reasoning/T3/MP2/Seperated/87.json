The probability that there are more black squares than white squares in $S$ is $48 \\%$. Find $k$. Instead of determining the dimension of the board, simply find $b = n - 3$, where $n$ is the number of possible starting positions along one dimension for the subsquare derived from the positional analysis of the board."

For a k x k chessboard, the number of starting positions for a 5x5 square along one dimension is m = k - 4. The number of such squares with more black squares is 12 when m = 5 (since (5x5 grid of starting positions has 12 positions where i+j is odd, leading to 12/25 = 48%). Thus, m = 5, so n = 5. Then b = n - 3 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: The equation 3^x 4^y = 2^{x+y} + 2^{2(x+y)-1} is analyzed by setting t = x + y. Testing integer values reveals solutions when (x, y) = (0, 1), (1, 1), and (2, 2). These satisfy the equation as verified by substitution.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(0,1),(1,1),(2,2)\"\n}",
