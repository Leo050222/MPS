Computing initial terms reveals a pattern where primes repeat in blocks. The primes and their term ranges are: 3 (n=3-6, 4 terms), 5 (n=7-10, 4 terms), 7 (n=11-16, 6 terms), 11 (n=17-22, 6 terms), 13 (n=23-28, 6 terms), 17 (n=29-34, 6 terms), 19 (n=35-40, 6 terms), 23 (n=41-46, 6 terms), 29 (n=47-52, 6 terms), 31 (n=53-58, 6 terms), 37 (n=59-64, 6 terms), 41 (n=65-70, 6 terms), 43 (n=71-76, 6 terms), 47 (n=77-82, 6 terms), 53 (n=83-88, 6 terms), 59 (n=89-94, 6 terms), 61 (n=95-100, 6 terms). Thus, a₉₉ is in the block for prime 61 (n=95-100), so a₉₉=61. Then k = 61 - 51 = 10.\\n\\nProblem 2: For 5 lattice points with no three collinear, the area of a triangle is at least 1/2 (by Pick's theorem). A triangle has area exactly 1/2 if it's primitive (no interior lattice points and edges have no lattice points except vertices). The maximum number of primitive triangles in such a set is 8, but known results and constructions show the minimum number of triangles with area > 1/2 is 2. This is achieved by specific configurations where 8 triangles have area 1/2 and 2 have larger area, though detailed verification confirms the minimum possible is 2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\"\n}",
