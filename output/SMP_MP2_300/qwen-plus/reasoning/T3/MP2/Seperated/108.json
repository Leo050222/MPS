Thus, $b^2 - a^2 = 1111$, which factors as $(b-a)(b+a) = 1111$. The factor pairs of 1111 are (1, 1111) and (11, 101). The valid pair for 4-digit squares is (11, 101), giving $b = 56$, $a = 45$. Checking $45^2 = 2025$ (digits 2,0,2,5 < 6) and $56^2 = 3136 = 2025 + 1111$. Thus, $m = a - 42 = 45 - 42 = 3$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The divisor $x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$. The remainder $R(x)$ is quadratic: $R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. Using given remainders: $R(1) = -4$, $R(2) = -1$, $R(3) = 4$. Solving the system:\\n- $a + b + c = -4$\\n- $4a + 2b + c = -1$\\n- $9a + 3b + c = 4$\\nYields $a = 1$, $b = 0$, $c = -5$. Thus, $R(x) = x^2 - 5$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"x^2 - 5\"\n}",
