If Jude continues flipping forever, let $p$ be the probability that he flips 3 heads in a row at some point. Compute $\\lfloor 180 p\\rfloor$. Instead of computing the floor of 180 times the probability of eventually flipping three heads in a row, simply find $\\delta = p_5 - \\frac{53}{72}$, where $p_5$ is the probability that the fifth head is preceded by a tail and that no three consecutive heads have occurred in the sequence up to the fifth head, as derived from analyzing the process to avoid three consecutive heads."

Using gap analysis between heads and inclusion-exclusion to exclude sequences with three consecutive heads, it is found that $ p_5 = \\\\frac{53}{72} $.

Only two scenarios are possible: the third point inside the triangle formed by (0,0), (1,0), and the fourth point, or vice versa. By analyzing valid integer solutions for the inequalities defining interior points and leveraging symmetry between $ b > d $ and $ d > b $, the total count is calculated as 244.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"244\"\n}",
