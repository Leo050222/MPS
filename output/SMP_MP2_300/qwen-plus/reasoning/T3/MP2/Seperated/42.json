Each 2^aᵢ mod 5 cycles every 4: residues [1, 2, 4, 3] each appear 2 times for aᵢ from 0 to 7. The generating function for each variable is f(x) = 2(x + x² + x³ + x⁴). Using the orthogonality of characters, the number of solutions N is (1/5)[f(1)^5 + 4f(ω)^5], where ω is a primitive 5th root of unity. f(1) = 8, so f(1)^5 = 32768. For ω ≠ 1, f(ω) = -2, so f(ω)^5 = -32. Thus, N = (32768 - 128)/5 = 6528. Then k = N - 6527 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The set Sₙ is a fractal formed by 8 copies of Sₙ₋₁ in a 3×3 grid. The expected Manhattan distance aₙ scales with 3ⁿ. Using self-similarity and symmetry, the limit of aₙ/3ⁿ is found by solving a recursive equation for the expected distance in the scaled [0,1] interval. The x and y coordinates are symmetric, so we compute the expected distance for one coordinate and double it. The recursion yields the limit 12/17, where 12 and 17 are coprime. Thus, 100a + b = 1217.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1217\"\n}",
