Testing small primes, we find that $p = 5$, $q = 3$, and $r = 19$ satisfies the equation: $3(5)^4 - 5(3)^4 - 4(19)^2 = 1875 - 405 - 1444 = 26$. Since $r = 19$ is prime, $m = r - 16 = 3$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For triangle $ABC$ with perimeter 1, the altitudes form a triangle if and only if the smallest side $a = \\\\min(AB, BC, CA)$ satisfies $\\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{5}}{4} < a \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{3}$. This is derived from analyzing the triangle inequalities for the altitudes and the original triangle's constraints. The lower bound is open because degenerate altitude triangles are excluded, while the upper bound $\\\\frac{1}{3}$ (equilateral triangle) is valid.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"((3 - sqrt(5))/4, 1/3]\"\n}",
