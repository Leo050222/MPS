You repeatedly do the following: select two points on the twig independently and uniformly at random, make cuts on these two points, and keep only the largest piece. After 2012 repetitions, what is the expected length of the remaining piece? Instead of computing the expected remaining length after many such cutting operations, simply find $k = a_1 + \\frac{133}{18}$, where $a_1$ is the expected length of the longest piece obtained from a unit-length twig in a single operation of selecting two uniform random points, cutting, and retaining the largest segment."

By analyzing the regions where each segment is the longest and integrating over these regions, we find that the expected value $a_1 = \\\\frac{11}{18}$. Then $k = a_1 + \\\\frac{133}{18} = \\\\frac{11 + 133}{18} = \\\\frac{144}{18} = 8$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Starting with vectors $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$, each operation replaces one vector with the sum of both. The determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors remains 1, so the cross product magnitude is 1. The cotangent of the angle between the vectors equals their dot product. To minimize the angle, we maximize the dot product. After 8 steps, the maximum dot product follows the Fibonacci sequence, specifically $F_{16} = 987$, which is the cotangent of the minimum angle.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"8\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"987\"\n}",
