Instead of computing the circumradius of the cyclic hexagon with the specified side lengths, simply find $k = d - 15$, where $d$ is the length of the diameter of the circumcircle derived from the geometric construction ensuring the points are concyclic."

Using chord length formulas and the fact that the sum of central angles is 2π, we derive equations involving the circumradius R. By setting variables for half-angles and using trigonometric identities, we form a cubic equation in the diameter d. Solving this cubic, we find d = 16 is the valid positive root. Thus, k = d - 15 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let P(t) = a t² + b t + c. Given the functional equation, we find constraints: a = P(1), b = P(a), c = P(b), and c = -b. Solving these leads to two cases: the zero polynomial (yielding 0) and a specific quadratic polynomial with a = -1, b = -1/3, c = 1/3. Computing P(P(P(P(1)))) for the non-zero case gives 1/9, which is larger than 0.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/9\"\n}",
