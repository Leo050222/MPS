After they finish construction, it turns out that each city can reach exactly 3 other cities via a single road, and from any pair of distinct cities, either exactly 0 or 2 other cities can be reached from both cities by a single road. Compute the number of ways HMMTLand could have constructed the roads. Instead of computing the total number of possible road constructions satisfying the conditions, simply find $e = N - 833$, where $N$ is the number of connected road constructions satisfying the conditions."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The problem requires counting connected 3-regular graphs on 8 labeled vertices where any two distinct vertices have 0 or 2 common neighbors. Such graphs must be bipartite with partitions of size 4 (since non-bipartite graphs lead to contradictions with the common neighbor condition). The valid graphs are exactly the complements of perfect matchings in complete bipartite graphs $K_{4,4}$. The number of labeled bipartitions is $\\\\binom{8}{4} = 70$, and for each bipartition, there are $4! = 24$ perfect matchings. Each graph is counted twice (once for each partition), so the total number of connected graphs is $(70 \\\\times 24)/2 = 840$. Thus, $N = 840$ and $e = 840 - 833 = 7$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For $\\\\sqrt{x}$, $\\\\sqrt{x+7}$, and $\\\\sqrt{10-x}$ to form a non-degenerate triangle, the triangle inequalities must hold. Analyzing the inequalities:\\n- $\\\\sqrt{x} + \\\\sqrt{x+7} > \\\\sqrt{10-x}$ holds for $x > 0.2$.\\n- $\\\\sqrt{x} + \\\\sqrt{10-x} > \\\\sqrt{x+7}$ holds for $x < 9$.\\n- The third inequality always holds. The valid interval is $(0.2, 9)$, with length $8.8$. The probability is $8.8 / 10 = 22/25$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"7\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"22/25\"\n}",
