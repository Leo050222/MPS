Instead of determining the total number of unordered triples of positive integers that sum to the given total, simply find $e = l + 2012$, where $l$ is the terminal term of the shorter arithmetic sequence arising in the case analysis for enumerating the possible middle addends."

For unordered triples $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c $ summing to 2002, the middle term $ b $ ranges such that the number of valid $ a $ values forms two sequences. The shorter sequence corresponds to $ b $ from 668 to 1000, where the number of $ a $ values is $ 2002 - 2b $, forming a decreasing arithmetic sequence with first term 666 and last term 2. Thus, $ l = 2 $, so $ e = 2 + 2012 = 2014 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The smallest $ n $ with exactly 2015 divisors requires factorizing 2015 = 5 × 13 × 31. The minimal $ n $ uses exponents $ 30, 12, 4 $ (since $ 31-1=30 $, $ 13-1=12 $, $ 5-1=4 $) assigned to the smallest primes: $ n = 2^{30} \\\\times 3^{12} \\\\times 5^4 $.
