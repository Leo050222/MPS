Find the number of anti-palindromes less than $3^{12}$ such that no two consecutive digits in base 3 are equal. Instead of determining the total count of qualifying anti-palindromes, simply find $k = b_1 + 27$, where $b_1$ is the number of valid anti-palindromes with one digit derived from the anti-palindrome condition and the no consecutive equal digits constraint."

The only 1-digit anti-palindrome is 1 (base 3), which has no consecutive digits, so it satisfies the constraint. Thus, $b_1 = 1$. Then $k = 1 + 27 = 28$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For ten numbers arranged in a circle where each number is one more than the gcd of its neighbors, a valid sequence is $2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2$. Each number satisfies the condition (e.g., 2 = gcd(2,3)+1, 3 = gcd(2,4)+1, etc.). The sum of these numbers is $2+3+4+3+2+2+3+4+3+2 = 28$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"28\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"28\"\n}",
