Instead of determining the remainder when the number of ordered pairs of distinct commuting perfectutations is divided by the prime, simply find $m = p - 2010$, where $p$ is that prime."

Commuting pairs of perfectutations must either have disjoint supports or share the same support (where they are powers of each other). However, the key insight is recognizing that the problem instructs to find $ m = p - 2010 $ where $ p $ is the prime 2011 (the modulus). Since $ p = 2011 $, $ m = 2011 - 2010 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: For $ n \\\\geq 4 $, consider the triples $ (1,3,4) $ and $ (2,3,4) $. The union $ X_2 \\\\cup X_3 \\\\cup X_4 $ must be a subset of $ X_1 \\\\cup X_2 \\\\cup X_3 \\\\cup X_4 $, which has size equal to $ |X_1 \\\\cup X_3 \\\\cup X_4| = \\\\lceil \\\\sqrt{12} \\\\rceil = 4 $. However, $ |X_2 \\\\cup X_3 \\\\cup X_4| = \\\\lceil \\\\sqrt{24} \\\\rceil = 5 $, which is impossible as a subset cannot exceed the size of its superset.
