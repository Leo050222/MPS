Simplifying, $a = r + 1 + \\\\frac{1}{r - 1}$, so $r - 1$ must divide 1. Integer solutions are $r = 2$ (giving $a = 4$) and $r = 0$ (giving $a = 0$, invalid as $a$ must be positive). Thus, only $a = 4$ works, so there is 1 such $a$. Adding 42 gives $k = 43$.\\n\\nProblem 2: A $13 \\\\times 13$ board has 169 squares; removing the central square leaves 168, which is divisible by 4 (42 tiles). Using a coloring argument with colors based on column index mod 4, the counts of each color are 52, 39, 39, 39. Removing the central square (color 2) gives counts 52, 39, 38, 39. Horizontal tiles cover one of each color, vertical tiles cover 4 of one color. Equations for color coverage lead to contradictions modulo 4 (e.g., $h \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod 4$ vs $h \\\\equiv 3 \\\\mod 4$), proving impossibility.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"43\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
