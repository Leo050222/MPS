Thus, d = 0, so e = 0 + 96957 = 96957.\\n\\nProblem 2: The equation requires the sum of seventh powers of integers to equal 96957. Analyzing modulo 729 shows all terms must be multiples of 3. Substituting ni = 3mi reduces the problem to sum mi^6 = 133. The only solution is 2 terms of ±2 (64 each) and 5 terms of ±1 (1 each). The number of tuples is calculated as combinations of positions multiplied by sign choices: C(7,2) * 2^2 * 2^5 = 2688.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"96957\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2688\"\n}",
