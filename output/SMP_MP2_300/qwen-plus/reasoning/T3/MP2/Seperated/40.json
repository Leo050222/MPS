Let $d = \\\\gcd(a, x)$, so $a = d \\\\cdot m$, $x = d \\\\cdot n$ with $\\\\gcd(m, n) = 1$. Substituting into the equation $a + 2x = \\\\gcd(a, x) + \\\\gcd(x, x) + \\\\gcd(x, a) + 120$ gives $d(m + 2n) = d(n + 2) + 120$, simplifying to $d(m + n - 2) = 120$. Maximizing $a = d \\\\cdot m$ requires $n = 1$, leading to $a = 120 + d$. The largest divisor $d$ of 120 is 120, giving $a = 240$, $b = c = 120$. Here, $\\\\gcd(240, 120) = 120$, so $k = 120 - 120 = 0$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let $a_n = A + (n-1)D$ (arithmetic) and $g_n = G \\\\cdot r^{n-1}$ (geometric).
