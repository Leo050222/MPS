The equation becomes $a + 2b = 2d + b + 120 \\\\implies a + b = 2d + 120$. Express $a = dk$, $b = dm$ with $\\\\gcd(k, m) = 1$. Substituting gives $d(k + m - 2) = 120$. To maximize $a = dk$, set $m = 1$ (smallest valid $m$), so $k = \\\\frac{120}{d} + 1$. Then $a = d\\\\left(\\\\frac{120}{d} + 1\\\\right) = 120 + d$. Since $d$ must divide 120, the maximum $d = 120$, giving $a = 240$, $b = c = 120$. Here, $\\\\gcd(240, 120) = 120$, and $k = 120 - 120 = 0$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let arithmetic sequence $a_n = A + (n-1)D$ and geometric sequence $g_n = Gr^{n-1}$. From the first four terms:\\n- $n=1$: $A + G = 0$\\n- $n=2$: $A + D + Gr = 0$\\n- $n=3$: $A + 2D + Gr^2 = 1$\\n- $n=4$: $A + 3D + Gr^3 = 0$\\n\\nSolving, $A = -G$, $D = G(1 - r)$, and $r^3 - 3r + 2 = 0$ gives $r = -2$ (valid root).
