Using $P(10) = 331633$ and $P(-10) = 273373$, we separate even and odd coefficients. Calculating $P(10) + P(-10) = 605006$ and dividing by 2 gives the sum of even-powered terms: $302503$. Similarly, $P(10) - P(-10) = 58260$ and dividing by 2 gives the sum of odd-powered terms: $29130$. Analyzing these in base 100, we find coefficients $a_0 = 3$, $a_1 = 13$, $a_2 = 25$, $a_3 = 29$, $a_4 = 30$. Thus, $k = a_3 - 27 = 29 - 27 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a primitive right triangle with sides $m^2 - n^2$, $2mn$, $m^2 + n^2$, perimeter $P = 2m(m + n)$, area $A = mn(m^2 - n^2)$. We compute $\\\\frac{P^2}{A} = \\\\frac{4m(m + n)}{n(m - n)}$. Analyzing divisors of 4 for $n$ (since $n$ must divide 4), we find the maximum integer value occurs at $n = 4$, $m = 5$, yielding $\\\\frac{P^2}{A} = 45$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"45\"\n}",
