For the odd part, dividing by 10 gives $2913 = a_1 + 100a_3 + \\\\cdots$. Since $a_1 < 100$, $a_1 = 13$ and $a_3 = 29$. Thus, $k = a_3 - 27 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a primitive Pythagorean triple $(m^2 - n^2, 2mn, m^2 + n^2)$, $\\\\frac{P^2}{A} = \\\\frac{4m(m + n)}{n(m - n)}$. Analyzing valid coprime pairs $(m, n)$ with $m > n$, the maximum integer value occurs at $m = 5$, $n = 4$, yielding $\\\\frac{P^2}{A} = 45$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"45\"\n}",
