Let the two circles intersect at $A$ and $B$, and let the tangents to $\\omega_{2}$ at $A$ and $B$ intersect at $P$. If the area of $\\triangle ABP$ can be expressed as $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $b$ is square-free and $a, c$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a+10b+c$. Instead of computing the encoded integer from the parameters in the simplified expression for the area of $\\triangle ABP$, simply find $m = c - 22$, where $c$ is the denominator in that fractional expression derived from the geometric configuration of the circles and tangents."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The centers of the circles are 5 units apart (O₁O₂ = 5). Using the common chord AB, we find the midpoint M of AB. Solving for the distances from O₁ and O₂ to M, we get O₁M = 23/5 and AB = 8√6/5. The tangents from P to ω₂ intersect at P on the line O₁O₂. Coordinates show P is at (-5, 0). The area of △ABP is calculated as (1/2) * AB * horizontal distance from P to AB, resulting in 192√6/25. The denominator c is 25, so m = c - 22 = 3.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a 2×n grid with 3 colors and no adjacent same colors, each column must have distinct colors (vertical adjacency). The recurrence relation shows each column after the first has 3 choices given the previous, leading to Tₙ = 6×3ⁿ⁻¹. For n = 2008, the number of colorings is 6×3²⁰⁰⁷.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6*3^2007\"\n}",
