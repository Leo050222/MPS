  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The quartic equation $r^4 + kr^3 + r^2 + 4kr + 16 = 0$ is analyzed for factorization. It factors as $(r^2 + ar + 4)(r^2 + cr + 4)$ where $a + c = k$ and $ac = -7$. For exactly one real root (positive), one quadratic must have a repeated root (discriminant zero) and the other no real roots. Setting $a = -4$ (yielding root $r = 2$) gives $c = 7/4$, so $k = -9/4$. Thus, $\\\\kappa = -9/4$ and $e = -9/4 + 40009/4 = 10000$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The sum of digits from 1 to $n$ is calculated. Sum up to 99 is 900. Each hundred block (100-199, etc.) contributes increasing sums: 1000, 1100, ..., 1600 for 700-799. Cumulative sum up to 799 is $900 + 1000 + 1100 + 1200 + 1300 + 1400 + 1500 + 1600 = 10000$. Hence, $n = 799$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10000\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"799\"\n}",
