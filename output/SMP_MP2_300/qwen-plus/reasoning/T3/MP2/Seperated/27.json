      "A499": "A tightrope walker stands in the center of a rope of length 32 meters. Every minute she walks forward one meter with probability $3 / 4$ and backward one meter with probability $1 / 4$. What is the probability that she reaches the end in front of her before the end behind her? Instead of computing the probability of reaching the forward end before the backward end in this biased random walk on a line, simply find $k = r + 2/3$, where $r$ is the ratio of the backward probability to the forward probability."

He starts at the square labeled 1 and every second walks to an adjacent square. How many paths can Sam take so that the sum of the numbers on every square he visits in his path is equal to 20 (not counting the square he started on)?"

The recurrence relations account for transitions between adjacent squares. After computing up to sum=20, the total number of valid paths is the sum of dp[1][20], dp[2][20], dp[3][20], and dp[4][20], which equals 74 + 42 + 43 + 31 = 190.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"190\"\n}",
