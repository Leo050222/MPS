The third condition $P(P(0)) = 400$ leads to $a c^2 = 400$ with $c = 21 - a$. Solving $a(21 - a)^2 = 400$ yields valid $a$ values, but $b$ remains fixed at $-1$. Thus, $k = b + 3 = -1 + 3 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Rewrite the constraint $2x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2x - 4y + 2xz - 5$ by completing the square. This simplifies to $2\\\\left(x - \\\\frac{z+1}{2}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{(z-1)^2}{2} + (y+2)^2 = 0$, which holds only when $x=1$, $y=-2$, $z=1$. Thus, $x - y + z = 1 - (-2) + 1 = 4$ is the only possible value, hence the maximum.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4\"\n}",
