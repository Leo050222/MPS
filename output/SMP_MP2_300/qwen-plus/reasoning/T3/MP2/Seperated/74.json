Thus, $k = b + 3 = -1 + 3 = 2$. The value of $b$ is fixed, so $k$ is uniquely determined.\\n\\nProblem 2: Rearrange the equation $2x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2x - 4y + 2xz - 5$ to complete the square. After simplification, it becomes $2\\\\left(x - \\\\frac{z+1}{2}\\\\right)^2 + (y + 2)^2 + \\\\frac{(z - 1)^2}{2} = 0$. Each squared term must be zero, yielding $x = 1$, $y = -2$, $z = 1$. Thus, $x - y + z = 1 - (-2) + 1 = 4$, which is the only solution and hence the maximum value.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4\"\n}",
