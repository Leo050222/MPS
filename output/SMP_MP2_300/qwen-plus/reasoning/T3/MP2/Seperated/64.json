For $1 \\leq i \\leq 6$, let $C_{i}$ be a unit circle centered at $P_{i}$ and $\\ell_{i}$ be one of the internal common tangents of $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+2}$, where $C_{7}=C_{1}$ and $C_{8}=C_{2}$. Assume that the lines $\\{\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}, \\ell_{5}, \\ell_{6}\\}$ bound a regular hexagon. The area of this hexagon can be expressed as $\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of determining the value 100 times the numerator plus the denominator for the area of the bounded regular hexagon when expressed as the square root of a reduced fraction, simply find $e = k + 1986$, where $k$ is the denominator of that reduced fraction."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The area of the bounded regular hexagon formed by the internal common tangents is derived by calculating the apothem from the origin to each tangent line. The distance between centers of circles $C_i$ and $C_{i+2}$ is $2\\\\sqrt{3}$, and using properties of internal common tangents, the apothem $m$ of the bounded hexagon is found to be $\\\\sqrt{6}/3$. The area of a regular hexagon with apothem $m$ is $2\\\\sqrt{3}m^2$, which simplifies to $4\\\\sqrt{3}/3$. This equals $\\\\sqrt{16/3}$, so $a = 16$, $b = 3$. The problem instructs to compute $e = k + 1986$ where $k$ is the denominator $b$, giving $e = 3 + 1986 = 1989$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Solve $S_1 - S_2 = 1989$ where $S_1 = x^2$, $S_2 = y^2$. Factor as $(x - y)(x + y) = 1989$. The factor pairs of 1989 (both odd) yield solutions for $(x, y)$: (995, 994), (333, 330), (115, 106), (83, 70), (67, 50), (45, 6). Thus, the square pairs are $(995^2, 994^2)$, $(333^2, 330^2)$, $(115^2, 106^2)$, $(83^2, 70^2)$, $(67^2, 50^2)$, $(45^2, 6^2)$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1989\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(990025, 988036), (110889, 108900), (13225, 11236), (6889, 4900), (4489, 2500), (2025, 36)\"\n}",
