For $1 \\leq i \\leq 6$, let $C_{i}$ be a unit circle centered at $P_{i}$ and $\\ell_{i}$ be one of the internal common tangents of $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+2}$, where $C_{7}=C_{1}$ and $C_{8}=C_{2}$. Assume that the lines $\\{\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}, \\ell_{5}, \\ell_{6}\\}$ bound a regular hexagon. The area of this hexagon can be expressed as $\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of determining the value 100 times the numerator plus the denominator for the area of the bounded regular hexagon when expressed as the square root of a reduced fraction, simply find $e = k + 1986$, where $k$ is the denominator of that reduced fraction."

By analyzing the geometry, the distance from the origin to each tangent line (apothem) is found to be √6/3. The area of the bounded hexagon is calculated as 4√3/3, which equals √(16/3). Thus, a=16 and b=3 (reduced fraction). The problem asks for e = k + 1986 where k is the denominator b=3, so e=3+1986=1989.\\n\\nProblem 2: Solve S₁ - S₂ = 1989 where S₁ and S₂ are squares. Factorizing 1989 = (m-n)(m+n), all positive factor pairs (d,e) with d≤e and d*e=1989 yield integer solutions for m=(d+e)/2 and n=(e-d)/2.
