He repeats this action until there are equal numbers of white and black socks remaining. Suppose that the probability he stops before all socks are gone is $p$. If the sum of all distinct possible values of $p$ over all initial combinations of socks is $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$ Instead of computing the sum of all distinct possible values of the stopping probability over all initial combinations of socks, simply find $e = p_{10} + \\frac{38324}{19}$, where $p_{10}$ is the stopping probability when the drawer initially contains an equal number of white and black socks."
