He repeats this action until there are equal numbers of white and black socks remaining. Suppose that the probability he stops before all socks are gone is $p$. If the sum of all distinct possible values of $p$ over all initial combinations of socks is $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$ Instead of computing the sum of all distinct possible values of the stopping probability over all initial combinations of socks, simply find $e = p_{10} + \\frac{38324}{19}$, where $p_{10}$ is the stopping probability when the drawer initially contains an equal number of white and black socks."

The probability of not stopping before all socks are gone is 1/19, so p_10 = 1 - 1/19 = 18/19. Then e = 18/19 + 38324/19 = 38342/19 = 2018.\\n\\nProblem 2: This is a birth-death process where the expected time to reach all frogs in the pool from 2018 in the pool and 1 on shore follows a pattern. For total frogs M, the expected time from M-1 to M is 2^M - 1. Here M = 2019, so the expected time is 2^2019 - 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2018\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2^2019 - 1\"\n}",
