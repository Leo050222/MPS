Let $r = P(1)$ and $s = P(2)$. Then $r + s = -b$ and $rs = c$. Computing $P(1) = 1 + b + c$ and $P(2) = 4 + 2b + c$, we derive $r + s = 5 + 3b + 2c = -b$, leading to $4b + 2c = -5$. Substituting $c = -\\\\frac{5}{2} - 2b$ into $rs = c$ and solving yields $b = -\\\\frac{1}{2}$, $c = -\\\\frac{3}{2}$. Thus, $k = c + \\\\frac{4037}{2} = -\\\\frac{3}{2} + \\\\frac{4037}{2} = 2017$.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need $N > 2017$ such that exactly 40% of numbers from 1 to $N$ have leftmost digit 1. For $N$ in $[10^m, 2 \\\\cdot 10^m - 1]$, $C(N) = N - \\\\frac{8}{9}(10^m - 1)$. Setting $C(N) = 0.4N$ gives $N = \\\\frac{40}{27}(10^m - 1)$. The smallest $m$ where $N > 2017$ and $N$ is integer is $m = 6$, yielding $N = 1,481,480$. Verification confirms $C(N) = 592,592$ and $592,592 / 1,481,480 = 0.4$ exactly.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2017\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1481480\"\n}",
