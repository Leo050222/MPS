Rearranging gives $f(x+1) - f(x) = f(y) - f(y-1)$, so $k$ is constant. Thus, $f(z) = kz + c$. Using $f(2016) = 6102$ and $f(6102) = 2016$, we solve $k \\\\cdot 2016 + c = 6102$ and $k \\\\cdot 6102 + c = 2016$. Subtracting equations: $k(6102 - 2016) = 2016 - 6102 \\\\implies 4086k = -4086 \\\\implies k = -1$. Then $h = k + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The given tetromino is the T-tetromino. A $4 \\\\times 4n$ grid has area $16n$, divisible by 4. Known results show that the T-tetromino can tile a $4 \\\\times 4n$ grid in exactly one way for any positive integer $n$, as the tiling is unique due to the grid's dimensions and the tetromino's properties.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
