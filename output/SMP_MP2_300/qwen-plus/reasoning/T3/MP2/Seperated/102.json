However, $ \\\\sqrt{4} $ is a constant equal to 2, regardless of the context. Thus, $ k = 2 - 1 = 1 $. The structural analysis of the nested square root $ \\\\sqrt{1.5 + \\\\sqrt{2}} $ confirms it denests to $ 1 + \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2} $, but the problem explicitly defines $ \\\\sqrt{4} $ as the rational component, which is 2. Hence, $ k = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let $ \\\\alpha = 1 - \\\\sqrt[3]{2} + \\\\sqrt[3]{4} $. Let $ \\\\beta = \\\\sqrt[3]{2} $, so $ \\\\beta^3 = 2 $ and $ \\\\alpha = \\\\beta^2 - \\\\beta + 1 $. By manipulating $ \\\\alpha $ and using $ \\\\beta^3 = 2 $, we derive $ \\\\beta = \\\\frac{3 - \\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha} $. Substituting into $ \\\\beta^3 = 2 $ gives $ (3 - \\\\alpha)^3 = 2\\\\alpha^3 $, which simplifies to $ \\\\alpha^3 - 3\\\\alpha^2 + 9\\\\alpha - 9 = 0 $. This cubic polynomial is monic, has integer coefficients, and is irreducible over $ \\\\mathbb{Q} $ (verified via Rational Root Theorem), making it the minimal polynomial.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"x^3-3x^2+9x-9\"\n}",
