      "A1054": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $e = N - 86$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Each of the 8 antigens is present in exactly half of the 256 subsets (since all subsets are distinct and there are 2^8 = 256 subsets). Thus, for any given antigen, N = 256 / 2 = 128. Then e = N - 86 = 128 - 86 = 42.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let the integers be a, b, c. The equations derived from the operations are:\\n1. (a + b)/2 + c = 42 → a + b + 2c = 84\\n2. (a + c)/2 + b = 13 → a + 2b + c = 26\\n3. (b + c)/2 + a = 37 → 2a + b + c = 74\\nSolving these equations yields a = 28, b = -20, c = 38. Verification confirms these values produce the results 42, 13, and 37.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"42\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"28, -20, 38\"\n}",
