This implies $\\\\gcd(n, 2) = 1$ and $\\\\gcd(n, 3) = 1$, so $\\\\gcd(n, 6) = 1$.

Using Vieta's formulas and symmetry, the maximum value of the expression $\\\\frac{(x_1 + x_2)(x_1 + x_3)x_4}{(x_4 + x_2)(x_4 + x_3)x_1}$ occurs when the roots are $\\\\frac{1}{2}, 1, 1, 2$. Assigning $x_1 = \\\\frac{1}{2}$, $x_2 = 2$, $x_3 = 1$, $x_4 = 1$, the expression evaluates to $\\\\frac{5}{4}$. This is confirmed by optimizing the function $\\\\frac{5t}{2(1 + t^2)}$ which achieves its maximum at $t = 1$, yielding $\\\\frac{5}{4}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"5/4\"\n}",
