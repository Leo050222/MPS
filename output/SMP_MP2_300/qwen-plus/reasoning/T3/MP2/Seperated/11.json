Instead of computing the total number of such valid colorings, simply find $m = N_1 + 1968$, where $N_1$ is the number of valid colorings arising from partitioning the vertices into two disjoint scalene triangles and a singleton vertex, with each part monochromatic in a distinct color."

A scalene triangle in a heptagon has arc lengths (1,2,4) in some order, and there are 14 such triangles total. For each singleton (7 choices), there is exactly one way to partition the remaining 6 vertices into two scalene triangles. Each partition allows 3! = 6 color assignments (distinct colors for each part). Thus, $ N_1 = 7 \\\\times 6 = 42 $. Then $ m = 42 + 1968 = 2010 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The sequence $ S_k $ is defined recursively. Zeros occur at positions $ z_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1} - 3}{2} $.
