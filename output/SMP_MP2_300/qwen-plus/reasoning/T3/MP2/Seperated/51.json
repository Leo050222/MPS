      "A1098": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability $ p $ is derived using a recurrence relation where $ g(m) $ represents the probability starting from $ 5m $ rocks. The key insight is recognizing the recurrence for $ S(m) $, the sum of probabilities up to $ m $, leading to $ S(m) = \\\\prod_{k=1}^m \\\\frac{5k + 1}{5k} $. For $ m = 403 $ (since $ 2015 = 5 \\\\times 403 $), the exponent of 31 in $ p $ is calculated by analyzing the numerator and denominator of $ g(403) $. The numerator has 14 factors of 31 (13 terms divisible by 31, one of which is divisible by $ 31^2 $), and the denominator has 13 factors of 31 from $ 403! $. Thus, $ b = 1 $, and $ m = b + 2 = 3 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using the identity $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) $, we find that the system reduces to analyzing symmetric solutions. The only solutions are the triple $ (1, 1, 1) $ and all permutations of $ (-5, 4, 4) $, as verified by substituting and checking the equations. These are all real solutions, and complex solutions would require parameterization, but the problem context implies listing the symmetric real solutions.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(1,1,1), (-5,4,4), (4,-5,4), (4,4,-5)\"\n}",
