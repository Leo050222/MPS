At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability $ p $ that the number of rocks left after each round is a multiple of 5 is analyzed using a recurrence relation. Starting from $ m = 403 $ (since $ 2015 = 5 \\\\times 403 $), the probability $ p(m) $ follows a specific pattern derived from the generating function $ (1 - x)^{-1/5} $. The exponent of 31 in $ p $ is determined by counting the occurrences of 31 in the numerator (product of terms $ 5k + 1 $) and denominator ($ 403! $). The numerator has 14 factors of 31 (13 terms divisible by 31, one of which is divisible by $ 31^2 $), and the denominator has 13 factors of 31. Thus, the exponent $ b = 14 - 13 = 1 $. The problem asks for $ m = b + 2 $, so $ m = 3 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The system $ x + y + z = 3 $ and $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 $ is solved using symmetric identities. The key identity $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) $ simplifies to $ xyz = 3(xy + yz + zx) - 8 $. Real solutions include the trivial solution $ (1, 1, 1) $ and permutations of $ (4, 4, -5) $. Complex solutions exist but the problem likely expects explicit solutions, which are the symmetric cases.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(1,1,1), (4,4,-5), (4,-5,4), (-5,4,4)\"\n}",
