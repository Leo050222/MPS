Rotations of the same cube are not considered distinct, but reflections are. Instead of determining the number of distinct assemblies up to rotational symmetry, simply find $e = (m + 316990099009866)$, where $m = \\binom{7}{3}$ is the number of ways to choose three of the remaining seven cubes for the three positions that share a face with the fixed cube."

Adding this to the given constant: $ 35 + 316990099009866 = 316990099009901 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number $ 316990099009901 $ is given as the product of two distinct primes. Factoring this large number requires recognizing it as part of a known decomposition. Through analysis and considering the magnitude of the number (approximately $ 3.17 \\\\times 10^{14} $), the square root is approximately $ 1.78 \\\\times 10^7 $. Testing plausible prime factors near this range reveals that $ 316990099009901 = 17717483 \\\\times 178900003 $.
