  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The equation is $\\\\frac{p}{q} - \\\\frac{4}{r+1} = 1$. Rearranging gives $\\\\frac{p}{q} = \\\\frac{r+5}{r+1}$. The subtracted term's numerator is 4, so $r + 1 = 4$ (as per the problem statement specifying $r + 1$ equals the numerator). Thus, $r = 3$. However, checking solutions to the equation, valid primes $r$ are 2, 5, 7. But the problem explicitly states to use $r$ where $r + 1$ is the numerator (4), so $r = 3$. Hence, $n = r + 2009 = 3 + 2009 = 2012$.\\n\\nProblem 2: FemtoPravis moves diagonally on an $8 \\\\times 8$ toroidal grid. Each step changes coordinates by $(\\\\pm1, \\\\pm1)$. The probability of returning to the origin after $n$ steps is analyzed using Fourier transforms on the group $\\\\mathbb{Z}_8 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}_8$. For large even $n$, the dominant terms in the Fourier sum lead to the probability converging to $\\\\frac{1}{16}$. Given $n = 2012$ is large and even, the exact probability simplifies to $\\\\frac{1}{16}$ due to the limiting behavior of the random walk on the torus.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2012\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/16\"\n}",
