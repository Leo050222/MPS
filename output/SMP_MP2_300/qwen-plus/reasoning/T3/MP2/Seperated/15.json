If \\(X\\) Dalmathians voted for the winning candidate, the expected value of \\(X^{2}\\) can be expressed as \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) for positive integers \\(a, b\\) with \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1\\). Find the unique positive integer \\(k \\leq 103\\) such that \\(103 \\mid a-bk\\). Instead of determining the specified integer related to the expected value of the square of the number voting for the winning candidate, simply find $r = P(\\textrm{same}) + 3/2$, where $P(\\textrm{same})$ is the probability that two voters vote for the same candidate derived from the independence of their votes."

Each voter has a 1/2 chance to vote for A or B. The probability both vote A is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4, and both vote B is also 1/4. Thus, P(same) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Then r = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: The equation $a^2 - 6ad + 8d^2 = 0$ is quadratic in $a$. Factoring gives $(a - 2d)(a - 4d) = 0$, so $a = 2d$ or $a = 4d$. Therefore, $\\\\frac{d}{a} = \\\\frac{1}{2}$ or $\\\\frac{1}{4}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/4, 1/2\"\n}",
