Find the unique positive integer \\(k \\leq 103\\) such that \\(103 \\mid a-bk\\). Instead of determining the specified integer related to the expected value of the square of the number voting for the winning candidate, simply find $r = P(\\textrm{same}) + 3/2$, where $P(\\textrm{same})$ is the probability that two voters vote for the same candidate derived from the independence of their votes."

Each voter has a 1/2 chance of voting for A or B. The probability both vote A is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4, and both vote B is also 1/4. Thus, P(same) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Then r = P(same) + 3/2 = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given the equation a² - 6ad + 8d² = 0 with a ≠ 0, let k = d/a. Substituting d = ka gives a² - 6a(ka) + 8(ka)² = 0. Dividing by a² yields 1 - 6k + 8k² = 0. Solving 8k² - 6k + 1 = 0 using the quadratic formula: k = [6 ± √(36 - 32)] / 16 = [6 ± 2]/16, resulting in k = 1/2 and k = 1/4. Thus, the possible values of d/a are 1/4 and 1/2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/4, 1/2\"\n}",
