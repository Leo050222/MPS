Using the third equation, we reduce $x^4 + 3x^3 + 5x$ via $t^2 = -t + A$, yielding $f(t) = (A + 7)t + (A^2 - 2A)$. For $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ with $x_1 \\\\neq x_2$, we require $A + 7 = 0$, so $A = -7$. Thus, $k = A + 9 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The sum $\\\\sum_{n=2}^{17} \\\\frac{n^2 + n + 1}{n^4 + 2n^3 - n^2 - 2n}$ is simplified by factoring the denominator as $n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2)$.
