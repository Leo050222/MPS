Compute $a_{1337}$.

Solving for a, b, c in terms of x, y, z and analyzing constraints (x ≤ a < x+1, etc.), only x=1 is possible. Testing integer values for y and z, two valid solutions emerge:\\n- When y=1, z=2: a = √(10/3) = √30/3, b = √30/4, c = 2√30/5.\\n- When y=2, z=1: a = √30/3, b = √30/2, c = √30/5.\\nBoth satisfy all floor conditions and original equations.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(√30/3, √30/4, 2√30/5), (√30/3, √30/2, √30/5)\"\n}",
