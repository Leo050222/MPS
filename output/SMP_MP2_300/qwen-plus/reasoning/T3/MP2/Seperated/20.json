  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The tetrahedron has AB=AC=AD=2, so the foot of the altitude from A to plane BCD (point X) is the circumcenter of triangle BCD. Let h = AX. Volume = 1 = (1/3) * Area(BCD) * h ⇒ Area(BCD) = 3/h. For triangle BCD, Area = (BC·CD·DB)/(4r) = 16/(4r) = 4/r, where r is the circumradius of BCD. Thus, 3/h = 4/r ⇒ r = 4h/3. By Pythagoras, AB² = h² + r² ⇒ 4 = h² + (16h²)/9 ⇒ 25h² = 36 ⇒ h = 6/5. Then δ = AX - 7/10 = 6/5 - 7/10 = 1/2.\\n\\nProblem 2: The problem requires counting integer pairs (x,y) such that (x+1/2, y+1/2) is inside triangle ABC. The conditions for (u,v) = (x+1/2, y+1/2) to be interior are: v > u/2, v < 11u, and 23u + 17v < 6300. Substituting u = x+1/2, v = y+1/2 gives: 2y - x ≥ 0, y ≤ 11x + 4, and 23x + 17y < 6280. For x from 0 to 29, the upper bound for y comes from AC (y ≤ 11x + 4); for x from 30 to 199, it comes from BC (y < (6280 - 23x)/17). Summing valid (x,y) pairs: 4710 for x=0-29 and 26770 for x=30-199, totaling 31480.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"31480\"\n}",
