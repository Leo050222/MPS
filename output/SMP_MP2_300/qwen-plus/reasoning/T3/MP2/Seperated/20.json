The volume formula gives area of BCD = 3/h. For triangle BCD, area = (BC·CD·DB)/(4R_bcd) = 4/R_bcd, so 3/h = 4/R_bcd ⇒ R_bcd = 4h/3. Using Pythagoras in triangle AXB: AB² = h² + R_bcd² ⇒ 4 = h² + (16h²)/9 ⇒ 25h² = 36 ⇒ h = 6/5. Thus, δ = AX - 7/10 = 6/5 - 7/10 = 1/2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using Pick's Theorem for half-integer points (centers of unit squares). The area of triangle ABC is 31500. Boundary half-integer points: 30 on AC, 10 on BC, total 40. Interior points = Area - B/2 + 1 = 31500 - 20 + 1 = 31481.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"31481\"\n}",
