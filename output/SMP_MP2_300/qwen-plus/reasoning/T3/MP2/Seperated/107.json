Let $m = -a$ where $a > 0$, leading to $a^5 + n^5 = 16an$. Testing small positive integers, we find $a = 2$, $n = 2$ satisfies the equation, giving $(m, n) = (-2, 2)$. This is the only solution with opposite signs where $n > 0$. Thus, $k = n - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given the polynomial $x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48$ with roots $p < q < r$, we use Vieta's formulas: $pqr = 48$. To minimize $\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$, we apply Lagrange multipliers, finding the critical point occurs when $q = 2p$ and $r = 3p$. Solving $p \\\\cdot 2p \\\\cdot 3p = 48$ gives $p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$. Substituting these values yields $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{3}{2}$, which is the minimum value.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
