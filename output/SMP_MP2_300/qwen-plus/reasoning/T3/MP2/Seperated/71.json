Subsets with largest element 5 must include 5 and any subset of {1,2,3,4}. Total such subsets: 16 (2^4). Bad subsets are those containing {1,4,5}, {2,3,5}, or {1,2,3,4}. Using inclusion-exclusion, bad subsets = |A| + |B| - |A∩B| = 4 + 4 - 1 = 7. Good subsets N_5 = 16 - 7 = 9. Thus k = 9 - 8 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Solve (ab+1)(bc+1)(ca+1)=84 for nonnegative integers (a,b,c). Factorizations of 84 into three positive integers:\\n- Two 1s and 84: Solutions where one variable is 0 and the other two multiply to 83 (prime). 6 solutions (permutations of (1,0,83)).\\n- Factors 3,4,7: Solutions where a,b,c ≥1. Solving (ab+1, bc+1, ca+1) = permutations of (3,4,7) gives 6 solutions (permutations of (1,2,3)).\\nTotal solutions: 6 + 6 = 12.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
