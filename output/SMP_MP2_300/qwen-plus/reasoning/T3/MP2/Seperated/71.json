We exclude those where any subset sums to 10.

Thus $ N_5 = 9 $, so $ k = 9 - 8 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: We solve $(ab+1)(bc+1)(ca+1) = 84$. Factorizations of 84 into three positive integers yield two cases:\\n1. Two factors are 1 (e.g., $ab+1=1$, $ca+1=1$), leading to $bc=83$ (prime). This gives 6 ordered triples with one zero (e.g., $(0,1,83)$).\\n2. Factors $3,4,7$ (permutations), corresponding to $(a,b,c)$ permutations of $(1,2,3)$, giving 6 ordered triples.\\nTotal: $6 + 6 = 12$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
