You continue this until you have 8 pieces of chalk. What is the probability that they all have length $\\frac{1}{8}$ ? Instead of computing the probability that all final pieces have equal length, simply find $k = \\binom{6}{3} - 16$, where $\\binom{6}{3}$ is the number of ways to interleave the remaining breaks between the two subtrees after the initial split, derived from the structural consideration of the balanced binary tree that produces uniform lengths."

Each participant remembers only who his two neighbours were, but not necessarily which one sat on his left and which one sat on his right. Today, you would like the same people to sit around the same round table so that each participant has the same two neighbours as yesterday (it is possible that yesterday’s left-hand side neighbour is today’s right-hand side neighbour). You are allowed to query some of the participants: if anyone is asked, he will answer by pointing at his two neighbours from yesterday.\n\na) Determine the minimal number $f(n)$ of participants you have to query in order to be certain to succeed, if later questions must not depend on the outcome of the previous questions. That is, you have to choose in advance the list of people you are going to query, before effectively asking any question.\n\nb) Determine the minimal number $g(n)$ of participants you have to query in order to be certain to succeed, if later questions may depend on the outcome of previous questions. That is, you can wait until you get the first answer to choose whom to ask the second question, and so on."

Calculating $ \\\\binom{6}{3} = 20 $, so $ k = 20 - 16 = 4 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: \\n- For part (a), in the non-adaptive case, the minimal number of queries required to uniquely determine the cycle up to reversal for any $ n \\\\geq 4 $ is 2. This is because a single query does not eliminate all rotational symmetries in the worst case for $ n \\\\geq 5 $, and two queries are necessary to fix the structure.\\n- For part (b), in the adaptive case, querying one person suffices. After learning their neighbors, the rest of the cycle is determined up to reversal, which is allowed. Thus, only 1 query is needed.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2,1\"\n}",
