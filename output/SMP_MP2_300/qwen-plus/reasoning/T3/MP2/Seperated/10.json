The Lucas sequence starts with $L_0 = 2$, $L_1 = 1$, and follows $L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}$. Calculating up to $L_8$: $L_2=3$, $L_3=4$, $L_4=7$, $L_5=11$, $L_6=18$, $L_7=29$, $L_8=47$. Thus, $d = 47 - 42 = 5$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Polynomials of degree exactly 5 with real coefficients mapping $\\\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\\\}$ to a permutation must be counted. A polynomial of degree ≤5 is uniquely determined by its values at 6 points. Total permutations are $6! = 720$. Polynomials of degree ≤4 correspond to permutations where the 5th finite difference is zero. Only affine linear polynomials (degree ≤1) can permute the set: identity ($P(x) = x$) and reverse ($P(x) = 7 - x$). Thus, 2 permutations have degree ≤4. Subtracting, $720 - 2 = 718$ polynomials have degree exactly 5.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"718\"\n}",
