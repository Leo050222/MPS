Instead of determining the value modulo the given prime of the result of iterating the quadratic function the specified number of times starting from the given initial value, simply find $d = L_8 - 42$, where $L_8$ is the eighth term of the sequence $(L_n)$ defined in the problem."

The Lucas sequence starts with $ L_0 = 2 $, $ L_1 = 1 $, and follows $ L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2} $. Calculating up to $ L_8 $: $ L_0=2 $, $ L_1=1 $, $ L_2=3 $, $ L_3=4 $, $ L_4=7 $, $ L_5=11 $, $ L_6=18 $, $ L_7=29 $, $ L_8=47 $. Thus, $ d = 47 - 42 = 5 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Polynomials of degree exactly 5 that permute $ \\\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\\\} $ correspond to permutations not representable by lower-degree polynomials. Only two permutations (identity and reversal) can be represented by affine linear polynomials (degree ≤1), which are also degree ≤4. Total permutations: $ 6! = 720 $. Subtracting the 2 affine permutations gives $ 720 - 2 = 718 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"718\"\n}",
