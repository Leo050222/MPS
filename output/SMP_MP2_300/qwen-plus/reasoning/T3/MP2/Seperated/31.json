      "A682": "The game of Penta is played with teams of five players each, and there are five roles the players can play. Each of the five players chooses two of five roles they wish to play. If each player chooses their roles randomly, what is the probability that each role will have exactly two players? Instead of computing the probability that every role is selected by precisely two players, simply find $e = T(favorable) - 1940$, where $T(favorable)$ is the total number of favorable outcomes where each role receives exactly two choices."

This is a known combinatorial problem, and the count for n=5 is 2040 (from OEIS sequence A001499). Thus, T(favorable) = 2040. Calculating e = 2040 - 1940 gives 100.\\n\\nProblem 2: The function ||k|| represents the absolute difference between k and the nearest perfect square. The sum of ||k|| from 1 to n can be analyzed by intervals between midpoints of consecutive squares. For each m ≥ 1, the interval [m² - m + 1, m² + m] has length 2m and sum of ||k|| equal to m². The cumulative sum up to the end of interval m is the sum of squares up to m. Solving for the smallest n where the average equals 100 involves finding when the cumulative sum equals 100n. Through detailed analysis, the smallest n satisfying this condition is found to be 89800.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"89800\"\n}",
