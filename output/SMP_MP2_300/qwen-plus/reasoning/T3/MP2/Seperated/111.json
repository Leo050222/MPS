Then m = 86 - 36 = 50. This is the required value of x.\\n\\nProblem 2: The set S has 201 elements. Using linearity of expectation, define indicator variables for 0 and each pair {k, -k} (k=1 to 100). The expectation for 0 being in T is 50/201. For each pair, the probability at least one element is in T is 1 - C(199,50)/C(201,50) = 117/268.
