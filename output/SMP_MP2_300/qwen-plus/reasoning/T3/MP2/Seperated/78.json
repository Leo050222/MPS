Compute Q(-1) = (-1)² + 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2. Then k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Suppose such an irrational α > 1 exists. For all n ≥ 1, floor(αⁿ) must be divisible by 2017, implying αⁿ ∈ [2017k_n, 2017k_n + 1) for integers k_n. However, for any α > 1, as n increases, αⁿ grows exponentially. If α is irrational, the fractional parts of αⁿ are either dense in [0,1) (non-Pisot) or tend to 0 (Pisot). In the dense case, floor(αⁿ) mod 2017 would take all residues, including non-zero. For Pisot numbers, the recurrence relation for floor(αⁿ) modulo 2017 would require initial terms to be 0 mod 2017, but constructing such a sequence for all n leads to contradictions as the required precision for α forces it to be rational. Thus, no such irrational α exists.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
