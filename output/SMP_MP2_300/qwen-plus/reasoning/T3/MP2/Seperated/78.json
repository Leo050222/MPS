Compute $ Q(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 3 = 2 $. Then $ k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Consider $ \\\\alpha = 2017 + \\\\delta $, where $ \\\\delta $ is a small positive irrational number (e.g., a Liouville number) such that $ \\\\delta < \\\\frac{1}{n \\\\cdot 2017^{n-1}} $ for all $ n \\\\geq 1 $. For each $ n $, the binomial expansion of $ \\\\alpha^n $ shows that $ \\\\alpha^n = 2017^n + S_n $, where $ S_n < 1 $. Thus, $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor = 2017^n $, which is divisible by 2017. Since $ \\\\delta $ can be chosen irrational, such an $ \\\\alpha $ exists.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"Yes\"\n}",
