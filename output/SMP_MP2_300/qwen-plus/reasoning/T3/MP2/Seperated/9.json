These men and women are very jealous - no man will allow his wife to sit next to any man except for himself, and no woman will allow her husband to sit next to any woman except for herself. In how many distinct ways can these 12 people be seated such that these conditions are satisfied? Instead of determining the total number of distinct valid seating arrangements under the jealousy conditions, simply find $k = N_3 - 2879$, where $N_3$ is the number of such arrangements in the configuration consisting of six alternating blocks of exactly two persons of the same gender each, derived from the block decomposition analysis of the seating constraints."

Each male block of two men must be arranged such that the adjacency conditions are satisfied. The key insight is that the seating arrangement corresponds to a permutation of the 6 men in the male seats (seats 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10), with the women's seats determined uniquely by the men's arrangement. The number of ways to arrange 6 men in these 6 seats is 6! = 720. Thus, N₃ = 720. Therefore, k = N₃ - 2879 = 720 - 2879 = -2159.\\n\\nProblem 2: The series is ∑ₖ=1^∞ 1/[(k+2)² + k]. Simplifying the denominator: (k+2)² + k = k² + 5k + 4 = (k+1)(k+4). Using partial fractions, 1/[(k+1)(k+4)] = (1/3)[1/(k+1) - 1/(k+4)]. The series telescopes, leaving the sum as (1/3)(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4) = 13/36.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"-2159\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"13/36\"\n}",
