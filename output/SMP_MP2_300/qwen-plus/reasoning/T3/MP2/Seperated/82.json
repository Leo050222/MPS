If the probability that $(3x+2y, x+4y)$ is in $S$ is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a+b$. Instead of computing the numerical identifier from the fractional probability that the transformed point remains within the unit square, simply find $k=$ area$(R) + 1553/120$, where area$(R)$ is the measure of the subset of the unit square on which both components of the linear transformation are at most 1."

The vertices of R are (0,0), (0, 1/4), (1/5, 1/5), and (1/3, 0). Using the shoelace formula, the area of R is calculated as 7/120. Then k = 7/120 + 1553/120 = 1560/120 = 13.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given a hand with exactly 4 honor cards (A, K, Q, J), we need the probability that the point value (4A + 3K + 2Q + J) is ≥13. Valid combinations of (A, K, Q, J) with sum 4 and point value ≥13 are enumerated. The total number of valid honor card combinations is 197, and the total number of ways to choose 4 honor cards is C(16,4) = 1820.
