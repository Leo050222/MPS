Each block rests on 4 smaller blocks, each with dimensions half those of the larger block. Laura removes blocks one at a time from this stack, removing only blocks that currently have no blocks on top of them. Find the number of ways Laura can remove precisely 5 blocks from Manya's stack (the order in which they are removed matters)."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The expression $a^4 + 4b^4$ can be factored using the Sophie Germain identity as $(a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2)$. For this product to be prime, one factor must be 1. The second factor $a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2 = (a - b)^2 + b^2$ equals 1 only when $a = b = 1$, yielding $1^4 + 4(1)^4 = 5$, which is prime. Thus, the prime number $m$ is 5.\\n\\nProblem 2: The stack forms a 4-level tree where each block in layer $k$ has 4 children in layer $k+1$. To remove 5 blocks with order mattering, we consider all valid sequences where each block is removed only after its parent. Cases are categorized by the number of blocks removed from each layer (level 1: root, level 2: 4 blocks, etc.). Summing valid sequences for all cases (e.g., removing root + 4 level 2 blocks, root + 3 level 2 + 1 level 3, etc.) gives a total of 5208 ways.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"5208\"\n}",
