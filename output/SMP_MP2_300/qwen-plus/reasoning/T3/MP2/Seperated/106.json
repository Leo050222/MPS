For a triangle with sides proportional to 3x, 4x, 5x (a right triangle), the altitudes correspond to 4x, 3x, and 12x/5. Matching the given altitudes: 4x = 20 (largest altitude), so x = 5. Then k = x - 3 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let S = a² + b². The equations become a + 10b/S = 5 and b + 10a/S = 4. Setting k = 10/S, solving the linear system and substituting back leads to a quartic equation in k. Solving yields k = 1/2, 2, (4±3i)/5. Corresponding (a, b) pairs are (4, 2), (1, 2), (5/2, 2 - 3i/2), (5/2, 2 + 3i/2). All satisfy the conditions.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(4, 2), (1, 2), (5/2, 2 - 3i/2), (5/2, 2 + 3i/2)\"\n}",
