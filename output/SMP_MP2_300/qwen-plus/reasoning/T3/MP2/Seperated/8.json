The point values are as follows: the value of each red card is 1 , the value of each blue card is equal to twice the number of red cards, and the value of each yellow card is equal to three times the number of blue cards. What is the maximum score you can get with fifteen cards?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The chord BC has length 1 in a circle of radius 1. The central angle for BC is 60° (since chord length = 2r sin(φ/2) ⇒ 1 = 2 sin(φ/2) ⇒ φ = 60°). The acute angle θ at A subtended by BC is half the minor arc BC, which is 30°. Thus, sin θ = sin 30° = 1/2. Then n = 1/2 + 29/2 = 30/2 = 15.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let r, b, y be the number of red, blue, yellow cards (r + b + y = 15). Score S = r + 2rb + 3by. Substituting y = 15 - r - b, S = r(1 - b) + 3b(15 - b). For b ≥ 2, S is maximized when r = 0 (since coefficient of r is negative), giving S = 3b(15 - b). This quadratic peaks at b = 7.5, so check b = 7 and b = 8: 3*7*8 = 168 and 3*8*7 = 168. Other cases (b ≤ 1 or r > 0) yield lower scores. Maximum score is 168.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"15\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"168\"\n}",
