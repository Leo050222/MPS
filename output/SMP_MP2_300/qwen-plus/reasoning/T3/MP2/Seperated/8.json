The point values are as follows: the value of each red card is 1 , the value of each blue card is equal to twice the number of red cards, and the value of each yellow card is equal to three times the number of blue cards. What is the maximum score you can get with fifteen cards?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The chord BC has length 1 in a circle of radius 1. The central angle subtended by BC is 60° (since chord length = 2R sin(θ/2) ⇒ 1 = 2 sin(θ/2) ⇒ θ/2 = 30°). The acute inscribed angle θ at A subtended by BC is half the central angle for the major arc, so θ = 30°. Thus, sin θ = 1/2. Then n = 1/2 + 29/2 = 30/2 = 15.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let r, b, y be the counts of red, blue, yellow cards (r + b + y = 15). Score S = r + 2rb + 3by. Substituting y = 15 - r - b, S = r(1 - b) + 45b - 3b². For b ≥ 2, the coefficient of r is negative, so r = 0 maximizes S. Then S = 3b(15 - b), a quadratic maximized at b = 7.5. Testing integers b = 7 and 8 gives S = 3*7*8 = 168 and 3*8*7 = 168. This is the maximum score.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"15\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"168\"\n}",
