Instead of computing the value of the function at the specified argument, simply find $k = f(68) - 730$, where $f(68)$ is the intermediate value of the function obtained by applying the recursive relation to reach the target argument."

For n=68, binary is 1000100, which in base-3 is 3^6 + 3^2 = 729 + 9 = 738. Thus, k = f(68) - 730 = 738 - 730 = 8.\\n\\nProblem 2: The cube graph is bipartite with two partitions of 4 vertices each. The number of independent sets (valid colorings where no two red vertices are adjacent) is calculated by considering all subsets of each partition and mixed sets with no adjacency. The total is 35, confirmed by enumerating independent sets by size and verifying with bipartite graph properties.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"8\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"35\"\n}",
