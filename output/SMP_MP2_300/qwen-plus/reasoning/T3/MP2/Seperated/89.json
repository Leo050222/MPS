      "A2540": "There are 8 lily pads in a pond numbered $1,2, \\ldots, 8$. A frog starts on lily pad 1. During the $i$-th second, the frog jumps from lily pad $i$ to $i+1$, falling into the water with probability $\\frac{1}{i+1}$. The probability that the frog lands safely on lily pad 8 without having fallen into the water at any point can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Find $100 m+n$. Instead of determining the numerical value derived from the reduced fractional representation of the survival probability, simply find $k = P + \\frac{16023}{8}$, where $P$ is the probability that the frog lands safely on lily pad 8 without having fallen into the water at any point derived from the sequential jump success probabilities suggested by the jumping mechanism."

The total survival probability P is the product: (1/2)(2/3)(3/4)...(7/8) = 1/8. Then k = P + 16023/8 = (1 + 16023)/8 = 16024/8 = 2003.\\n\\nProblem 2: The sum involves binomial coefficients where the lower index ≡1 mod 3. Using roots of unity, the sum for n=2003 (which is ≡2 mod 3 and odd) is (2^2003 - 2)/3. This is derived from the formula for such sums with modulus 3, considering the properties of 3rd roots of unity and simplifying using n+1=2004 (divisible by 3).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2003\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(2^2003 - 2)/3\"\n}",
