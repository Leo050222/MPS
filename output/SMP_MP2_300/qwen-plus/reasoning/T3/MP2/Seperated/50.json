      "A1092": "Farmer Bill's 1000 animals - ducks, cows, and rabbits - are standing in a circle. In order to feel safe, every duck must either be standing next to at least one cow or between two rabbits. If there are 600 ducks, what is the least number of cows there can be for this to be possible? Instead of determining the minimal number of cows required, simply find $k = r - 198$, where $r$ is the number of rabbits in the arrangement that achieves this minimum."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To minimize cows, maximize rabbits. Total animals: 1000. Ducks = 600, so cows (C) + rabbits (R) = 400. Each duck must be next to a cow or between two rabbits. Let x be ducks between two rabbits (Type A), so 600 - x need cow adjacency (Type B). Rabbit-duck edges: 2x ≤ 2R ⇒ x ≤ R. Cow-duck edges: 600 - x ≤ 2C. Substituting C = 400 - R gives 600 - x ≤ 800 - 2R ⇒ 2R ≤ x + 200. With x ≤ R, combining gives R ≤ 200. Max R = 200 (min C = 200). Then x = 200 (from 2R = x + 200). Rabbits r = 200. Thus, k = r - 198 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: The largest n where any three points have a unit distance pair. This requires the unit distance graph to have independence number ≤ 2 (no three points with no unit edges). The complement graph must be triangle-free (bipartite). In the plane, unit distance cliques max size 3 (equilateral triangle). Thus, the graph is union of two cliques (max size 3 each), so n = 3 + 3 = 6. Two disjoint equilateral triangles (side 1, far apart) work: any three points include two from one triangle (unit edge). n=7 impossible (needs clique >3 or three cliques, violating independence).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
