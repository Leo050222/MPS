      "A1092": "Farmer Bill's 1000 animals - ducks, cows, and rabbits - are standing in a circle. In order to feel safe, every duck must either be standing next to at least one cow or between two rabbits. If there are 600 ducks, what is the least number of cows there can be for this to be possible? Instead of determining the minimal number of cows required, simply find $k = r - 198$, where $r$ is the number of rabbits in the arrangement that achieves this minimum."

Duck blocks can only be length 1 or 2 (longer blocks have unsafe middle ducks). R-D-R blocks (length 1 between rabbits) use 0 cows. Length-2 blocks require 2 cows (1 per duck). Using two transitions (minimal), we find 199 rabbits (R = 199) when cows = 201. Thus, k = 199 - 198 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The largest n where every triple has a unit distance pair. This requires the unit distance graph to have independence number ≤ 2 (no 3-point independent set). The maximum is achieved with two disjoint equilateral triangles (6 points), as any triple has two in one triangle (unit distance). n=7 is impossible due to clique size limits in the plane.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
