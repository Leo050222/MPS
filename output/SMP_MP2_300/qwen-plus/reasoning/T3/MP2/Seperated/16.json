      "A2513": "Alice draws three cards from a standard 52-card deck with replacement. Ace through 10 are worth 1 to 10 points respectively, and the face cards King, Queen, and Jack are each worth 10 points. The probability that the sum of the point values of the cards drawn is a multiple of 10 can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$. Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing a hundred times the numerator plus the denominator of the fraction representing the probability in lowest terms, simply find $k = d + 0$, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that probability fraction."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability that the sum of three card values (with replacement) is a multiple of 10 is calculated using generating functions and roots of unity. The key insight is recognizing that for the fraction $\\\\frac{m}{n}$ in lowest terms, $\\\\gcd(m, n) = 1$ by definition. The problem instructs to find $k = d + 0$ where $d$ is this gcd, so $d = 1$ and $k = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The functional equation simplifies to $\\\\frac{P(2x)}{P(x+1)} = \\\\frac{8x}{x+7}$. Assuming $P(x)$ is a cubic polynomial (degree analysis), solving for coefficients with $P(1) = 1$ gives $P(x) = \\\\frac{1}{21}x(x+2)(x+6)$. Evaluating at $x = -1$ yields $P(-1) = -\\\\frac{5}{21}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-5/21\"\n}",
