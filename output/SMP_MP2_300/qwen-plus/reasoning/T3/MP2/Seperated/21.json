Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing the sum of all possible totals and the associated $100m + n$, simply find $k = z - 2$, where $z$ is the common value taken by the two equal variables in the solution where exactly two of the variables are equal."

Thus, z (the common value) is 3, so k = 3 - 2 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The polygons have 4, 5, and 6 sides respectively. Shared vertices create constraints. The square and hexagon sharing edge AO allow 2 orientations, and the pentagon sharing vertices E and I allows 2 orientations (N on either side of EI). Total distinct ON distances: 2 × 2 = 4.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4\"\n}",
