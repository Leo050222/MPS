Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing the sum of all possible totals and the associated $100m + n$, simply find $k = z - 2$, where $z$ is the common value taken by the two equal variables in the solution where exactly two of the variables are equal."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We consider the case where exactly two variables are equal. Assuming x = y ≠ z, solving the system leads to the cubic equation 2x³ - 9x² + 10x - 3 = 0. The roots are x = 1, 1/2, 3. The roots x = 1 and x = 1/2 result in all variables being equal, which are discarded. The valid solution for exactly two equal variables is x = y = 3, z = -1/3. The common value of the two equal variables is 3. Thus, k = z - 2 where z (the common value) is 3, so k = 3 - 2 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The polygons have sides equal to the number of letters: ICAO (4), VENTI (5), ALBEDO (6). The shared vertices and their adjacencies create constraints. The key is the relative orientations of the polygons. The hexagon (ALBEDO) can be oriented in two distinct ways relative to the square (ICAO), leading to two different positions for vertex E. The pentagon (VENTI) orientation (above/below line EI) does not affect the distance ON due to symmetry. Thus, there are two distinct values for ON given IN = 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\"\n}",
