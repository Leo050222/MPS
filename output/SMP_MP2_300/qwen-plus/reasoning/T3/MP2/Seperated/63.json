Squaring both sides leads to the conclusion that the second square root must be zero (since the first square root cannot be zero for positive x). Thus, the inner expression of the second square root is AC - 2 + 2Ax = 0, so b = 0. Therefore, k = b + 5 = 5.\\n\\nProblem 2: Testing small values shows that 3^2 - 5^1 = 4 = 2^2 is a solution. Modulo analysis and factoring show no other solutions exist. Mihăilescu's theorem and further checks confirm the only positive integer solution is (x, y, z) = (2, 1, 2).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(2,1,2)\"\n}",
