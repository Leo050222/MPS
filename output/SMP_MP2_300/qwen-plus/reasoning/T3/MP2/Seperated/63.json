Squaring both sides leads to the condition that the product of the inner expressions of the square roots must be zero. Since the first inner expression cannot be zero for positive x, the second must be zero. Thus, the inner expression of the second square root is 0, so b = 0 and k = 0 + 5 = 5.\\n\\nProblem 2: Testing small values and using modular arithmetic shows that the only solution in positive integers is when x=2, y=1, z=2. Further analysis using factorization and Mihăilescu's theorem confirms no other solutions exist.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(2, 1, 2)\"\n}",
