Removing 2 edges from $K_{5,5}$ results in 23 edges. The number of distinct $K_{5,5}$ graphs is $\\\\binom{10}{5}/2 = 126$. Each $K_{5,5}$ has $\\\\binom{25}{2} = 300$ ways to remove 2 edges. Assuming no overcounting (as connected bipartite graphs have unique bipartitions), $N_{\\\\Delta=5} = 126 \\\\times 300 = 37800$. Thus, $m = 37800 - 37798 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Solve the functional equation $3f\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{2f(x)}{x} = x^2$. Substitute $x \\\\to \\\\frac{1}{x}$ to get a second equation. Solving the system yields $f(x) = \\\\frac{3 - 2x^5}{5x^2}$.
