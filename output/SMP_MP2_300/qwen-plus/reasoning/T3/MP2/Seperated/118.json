The tangent line is L(t) = (2t + 1)/27. The difference L(t) - f(t) has numerator 2t⁴ + t³ - 11t + 8, which is p(t). Evaluating p(1) gives 0, so k = 0 + 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The equation xⁿ - yⁿ = 2¹⁰⁰ requires n > 1. For n=2, factor as (x - y)(x + y) = 2¹⁰⁰. Both factors must be powers of 2 with x - y = 2ᵃ, x + y = 2ᵇ, a + b = 100, and 1 ≤ a < 50 (to ensure y > 0). This gives 49 solutions. For n ≥ 3, no solutions exist due to parity and factorization constraints (odd n leads to odd factors, even n ≥ 4 leads to impossible power conditions). Thus, only n=2 contributes, yielding 49 ordered triples.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"49\"\n}",
