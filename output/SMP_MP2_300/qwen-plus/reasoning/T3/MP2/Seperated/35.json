      "A745": "Alice is sitting in a teacup ride with infinitely many layers of spinning disks. The largest disk has radius 5. Each succeeding disk has its center attached to a point on the circumference of the previous disk and has a radius equal to $2 / 3$ of the previous disk. Each disk spins around its center (relative to the disk it is attached to) at a rate of \\pi / 6$ radians per second. Initially, at $t=0$, the centers of the disks are aligned on a single line, going outward. Alice is sitting at the limit point of all these disks. After 12 seconds, what is the length of the trajectory that Alice has traced out? Instead of computing the total path length traversed by the limit point, simply find $k = r - 7$, where $r$ is the radius of the trajectory traced by that limit point."

She performs moves until the number is not positive, and then she stops. Let $N$ be the number of sequences of moves that Melody could perform. Suppose $N=a \\cdot 2^{b}$ where $a$ is an odd positive integer and $b$ is a nonnegative integer. Compute $100 a+b$."

The sum simplifies to a Möbius transformation of the unit circle, resulting in a circle with center (6, 0) and radius 9. Thus, r = 9, so k = r - 7 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of sequences N follows a recurrence relation f(n) = f(n-40) + f(n-41) with base cases f(n) = 2 for 1 ≤ n ≤ 40. For n = 770 = 40*19 + 10, the pattern shows f(770) = 2^20. Thus, N = 1·2^20, so a = 1, b = 20, and 100a + b = 120.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"120\"\n}",
