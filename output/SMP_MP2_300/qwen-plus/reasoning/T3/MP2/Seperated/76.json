Solving the system, we find that $14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m}$ and $14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m}$, where $m = n + 1$. This implies $m$ must be coprime to 14. By analyzing the equations, we derive $m = 14b - 1$ and $a = 3b + 6$. To satisfy the problem's context (likely expecting a positive $\\\\ell$), we find $b = 7$ gives $m = 97$, leading to $\\\\ell = 97 - 95 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The quadrilateral $ABCD$ has side lengths $AB=2$, $BC=3$, $CD=5$, $DA=4$. Since $AB + CD = BC + DA = 7$, it is tangential (has an incircle). The maximum area for a tangential quadrilateral with fixed sides occurs when it is cyclic. Using Brahmagupta's formula, the area is $\\\\sqrt{(7-2)(7-3)(7-5)(7-4)} = \\\\sqrt{120} = 2\\\\sqrt{30}$. The semiperimeter $s = 7$, so the maximum radius $r = \\\\text{Area}/s = 2\\\\sqrt{30}/7$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\\\\sqrt{30}/7\"\n}",
