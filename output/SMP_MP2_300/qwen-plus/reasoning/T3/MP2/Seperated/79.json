Place two squares of side lengths $a, b$ next to each other, such that the larger square has lower left corner at $(0,0)$ and the smaller square has lower left corner at $(a, 0)$. Draw the line passing through $(0, a)$ and $(a+b, 0)$. The region in the two squares lying above the line has area 2013. If $(a, b)$ is the unique pair maximizing $a+b$, compute $\\frac{a}{b}$. Instead of computing $\\frac{a}{b}$ for the unique pair maximizing $a + b$, simply find $e = \\lambda - 2/7$, where $\\lambda$ is the value of $\\frac{(a + b)^2}{a^2 - a b + 2 b^2}$ for that pair."

To maximize a + b under the constraint a² - ab + 2b² = 4026, we use Lagrange multipliers or discriminant analysis. The maximum occurs when the quadratic in b has a single solution, leading to 3a = 5b. Substituting into the constraint gives λ = (a+b)²/(a² - ab + 2b²) = 16/7. Thus, e = 16/7 - 2/7 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Expanding (x+y)² = (x+1)(y-1) yields x² + xy + y² + x - y + 1 = 0. Treating as a quadratic in x, the discriminant is -3(y-1)², which is non-negative only when y=1, leading to x=-1. Completing the square confirms the only real solution is (-1, 1).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(-1, 1)\"\n}",
