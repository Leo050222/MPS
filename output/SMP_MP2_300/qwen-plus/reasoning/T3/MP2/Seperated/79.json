Place two squares of side lengths $a, b$ next to each other, such that the larger square has lower left corner at $(0,0)$ and the smaller square has lower left corner at $(a, 0)$. Draw the line passing through $(0, a)$ and $(a+b, 0)$. The region in the two squares lying above the line has area 2013. If $(a, b)$ is the unique pair maximizing $a+b$, compute $\\frac{a}{b}$. Instead of computing $\\frac{a}{b}$ for the unique pair maximizing $a + b$, simply find $e = \\lambda - 2/7$, where $\\lambda$ is the value of $\\frac{(a + b)^2}{a^2 - a b + 2 b^2}$ for that pair."

To maximize a + b, set k = a/b (1 < k < 2). Expressing the area equation in terms of k gives b²(k² - k + 2) = 4026. Maximizing (a + b)² = b²(k + 1)² leads to maximizing f(k) = (k + 1)²/(k² - k + 2). Taking the derivative and solving f'(k) = 0 yields k = 5/3. For this k, λ = (a + b)²/(a² - ab + 2b²) = 16/7. Thus, e = λ - 2/7 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Expanding (x + y)² = (x + 1)(y - 1) gives x² + xy + y² + x - y + 1 = 0. Treating as a quadratic in x, the discriminant must be non-negative: -3(y - 1)² ≥ 0, which implies y = 1. Substituting y = 1 gives x = -1. The only real solution is (-1, 1).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(-1, 1)\"\n}",
