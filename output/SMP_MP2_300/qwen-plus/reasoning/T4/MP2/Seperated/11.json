  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The functional equation is missing in the problem statement, but common functional equations (e.g., Cauchy-type) often yield f(0) = 0. For example, setting x = y = 0 in equations like f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + xy leads to f(0) = 0. Thus, k = f(0) + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: The product of element orders in a finite abelian 2-group must be a power of 2. For cyclic 2-groups, the exponent of 2 in the product is (m-1)2^m + 1, which is ≡1 mod 4. For non-cyclic groups (rank ≥2), the exponent is ≡3 mod 4. Since 2009 ≡1 mod 4, only cyclic groups are candidates. Solving (m-1)2^m + 1 = 2009 gives no integer solution for m, so no such group exists.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
