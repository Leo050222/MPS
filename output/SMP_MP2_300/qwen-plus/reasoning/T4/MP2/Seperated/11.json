Setting $ x = y = 0 $, we get $ f(0) = 2f(0) $, so $ f(0) = 0 $. Thus, $ k = 0 + 2 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a finite abelian group $ G $, the product of the orders of all elements is $ 2^{2009} $. Finite abelian 2-groups have exponents $ E(G) $ (sum of $ \\\\log_2(\\\\text{order}(g)) $ over all $ g $) that must equal 2009. Cyclic groups yield $ E(G) = 1 + (m-1)2^m $, but 2009 cannot be expressed in this form. Non-cyclic groups have $ E(G) \\\\equiv 3 \\\\mod 4 $, while 2009 $ \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 4 $. Thus, no such group exists.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
