Here, $|S|$ denotes the number of elements in the set $S$. Instead of determining the total number of such triples of sets, simply find $m = |A \\cap B \\cap C|$, where $|A \\cap B \\cap C|$ is the size of the triple intersection derived from the structural consideration of configurations with no elements belonging to exactly two of the sets."

Given no elements belong to exactly two sets, the pairwise intersections equal the triple intersection. From |A ∩ B| = 2 and the condition that x12 = x13 = x23 = 0 (no elements in exactly two sets), we find |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 2. This satisfies all size conditions (|A|=|B|=|C|=4) and the universal set size (8 elements).\\n\\nProblem 2: We count pairs of red cubes where exactly 4 faces are visible. Valid configurations are:\\n- 12 adjacent corner pairs (cover 4 faces),\\n- 48 corner-edge pairs with 1 shared face,\\n- 24 corner-face center pairs with no shared faces,\\n- 30 edge-edge pairs with disjoint face sets.\\nSumming these gives 12 + 48 + 24 + 30 = 114. Each configuration ensures exactly 4 faces have red visibility, with rotations/reflections considered distinct.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"114\"\n}",
