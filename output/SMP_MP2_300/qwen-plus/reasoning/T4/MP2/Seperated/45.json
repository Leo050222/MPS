Here, $|S|$ denotes the number of elements in the set $S$. Instead of determining the total number of such triples of sets, simply find $m = |A \\cap B \\cap C|$, where $|A \\cap B \\cap C|$ is the size of the triple intersection derived from the structural consideration of configurations with no elements belonging to exactly two of the sets."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We consider configurations where no element belongs to exactly two sets. Thus, pairwise intersections $|A \\\\cap B|$, $|B \\\\cap C|$, $|C \\\\cap A|$ must equal $|A \\\\cap B \\\\cap C|$, since any element in a pairwise intersection must also be in the third set (to avoid being in exactly two sets). Given $|A \\\\cap B| = 2$, it follows that $|A \\\\cap B \\\\cap C| = 2$. Verifying with set sizes: each set has size 4, so $|A| = |A \\\\text{ only}| + |A \\\\cap B \\\\cap C| = 4$. With $|A \\\\cap B \\\\cap C| = 2$, $|A \\\\text{ only}| = 2$, and similarly for $B$ and $C$. Total elements accounted for: $2+2+2+2=8$, matching the universe size. Thus, $m = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: We count pairs of red cube positions such that their visible faces union to exactly 4 faces. Using structural analysis:\\n- **Case 1 (Corner + Face Center)**: 8 corners × 3 non-adjacent face centers = 24.\\n- **Case 2 (Edge + Edge)**: 30 pairs of edges with disjoint face pairs.\\n- **Case 3 (Corner + Edge)**: 8 corners × 6 edges with one shared face = 48.\\n- **Case 4 (Corner + Corner)**: 12 edge-adjacent corner pairs.\\nTotal: $24 + 30 + 48 + 12 = 114$. Cross-verified by categorizing 4-face subsets (Type A: 3 subsets × 2 pairs; Type B: 12 subsets × 9 pairs), confirming 114.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"114\"\n}",
