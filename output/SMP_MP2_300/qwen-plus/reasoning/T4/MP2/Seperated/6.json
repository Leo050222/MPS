This gives $ f(1^3 + 0^3 + 1 \\\\cdot 0) = 1^2 f(1) + 0^2 f(0) + f(0) $, simplifying to $ f(1) = f(1) + f(0) $. Thus, $ f(0) = 0 $, so $ k = 0 + 1 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a sequence where any 7 consecutive terms sum to positive and any 11 consecutive terms sum to negative, the maximal length is derived from the classic result for such constraints. The maximum length is $ 7 + 11 - 2 = 16 $. This avoids contradictions seen at length 17, where overlapping sums force a term to be both positive and negative.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"16\"\n}",
