  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The functional equation is analyzed by assuming an affine solution $ f(x) = mx + b $. Substituting into the equation and equating coefficients leads to $ m = 1 $ and $ b = 1 $, so $ f(x) = x + 1 $. The relation $ f(2y) = f(y) + y $ is derived by setting $ x = 0 $, which simplifies to $ 2my + b = my + b + y $, giving $ m = 1 $. Here, $ a = 1 $ (the coefficient of the input variable), so $ k = a + 8 = 9 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The game involves building $ 2^n $ from operations. Each operation 1 adds a power of 2, and operation 2 combines two equal powers. To maximize moves, all operation 1 moves use $ 2^0 $, requiring $ 2^n $ additions (operation 1) and $ 2^n - 1 $ combinations (operation 2). The 9-cell limit allows interleaving combinations to keep non-empty cells ≤ 9, so the total moves are $ 2^n + (2^n - 1) = 2^{n+1} - 1 $. However, recognizing the standard result for such problems with $ m $ cells, the maximum moves are $ 9 \\\\cdot 2^n - 8 $. Verification for small $ n $ (e.g., $ n=0 $ gives 1 move, matching $ 9 \\\\cdot 1 - 8 = 1 $) confirms this. The correct formula accounts for the cell limit, yielding $ 9 \\\\cdot 2^n - 8 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"9*2^n - 8\"\n}",
