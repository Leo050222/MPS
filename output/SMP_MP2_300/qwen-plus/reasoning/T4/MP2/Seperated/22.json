Instead of identifying all functions from the reals to the reals satisfying the given identity for all real inputs, simply find $k = a + 8$, where $a$ is the coefficient of the input variable in the unique affine solution derived from substituting the assumed linear form into the relation $f(2y) = f(y) + y$ obtained by analyzing the functional equation at specific points."

In each move, Sir Alex is allowed to perform exactly one of the following two operations:\n[list=1]\n[*] Choose any number of the form $2^j$, where $j$ is a non-negative integer, and put it into an empty cell.\n[*] Choose two (not necessarily adjacent) cells with the same number in them; denote that number by $2^j$. Replace the number in one of the cells with $2^{j+1}$ and erase the number in the other cell.\n[/list]\nAt the end of the game, one cell contains $2^n$, where $n$ is a given positive integer, while the other cells are empty. Determine the maximum number of moves that Sir Alex could have made, in terms of $n$.\n\n[i]"

From the relation f(2y) = f(y) + y derived by setting x=0 in the functional equation, substitute f(y) = ay + b: 2ay + b = (ay + b) + y ⇒ 2a = a + 1 ⇒ a = 1. Thus, k = a + 8 = 9.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize moves, Sir Alex adds 2^0s (operation 1) as much as possible. Total mass added must be 2^n, so number of operation 1 moves A = 2^n. Operation 2 moves B = A - 1 (since cells go from A to 1). Total moves = A + B = 2*2^n - 1 = 2^{n+1} - 1. The 9-cell constraint is satisfied as combining keeps occupied cells ≤9.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2^{n+1}-1\"\n}",
