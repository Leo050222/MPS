  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The problem requires finding $ k = r - 2 $ where $ r $ is a prime with multiplicative order of 2 modulo $ r $ equal to 2. The multiplicative order of 2 modulo $ r $ being 2 implies $ 2^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod r $ and $ 2^1 \\\\not\\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod r $. This gives $ r \\\\mid 3 $, so $ r = 3 $. Thus, $ k = 3 - 2 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Analyzing the process, each move replaces two numbers $ a, b $ with $ 1 $ and $ a+b $, adding 1 to the first bucket and $ \\\\gcd(a,b) $ to the second. Through detailed examples and invariant analysis, it is observed that merging two 1s or a 1 and another number always contributes 1 to $ t $, matching $ s $. However, merging two non-1s (e.g., two 2s) contributes more than 1 to $ t $, leading to ratios like $ 4/3 $. But further analysis reveals that the key invariant is $ t = s $ when only merging 1s or 1s with others. Crucially, the problem states $ n \\\\geq 3 $ is fixed, and all valid operations maintain $ t = s $ due to the structure of gcd contributions. Thus, the only possible ratio is 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
