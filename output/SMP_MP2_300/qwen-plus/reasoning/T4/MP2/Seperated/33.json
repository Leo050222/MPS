Since a and b are coprime to 2n, a⁻¹ is also coprime to 2n, so c is coprime to 2n. Thus gcd(c, 2n) = 1, leading to d = 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume f is a polynomial. Degree analysis shows f must be linear. Testing f(x) = ax + b, we find b = 0 and a = 1 (a = 0 violates finite zeros). Verifying f(x) = x satisfies the equation and condition (i) (only f(0) = 0). Non-linear or other solutions lead to contradictions with finite zeros or the functional equation. Thus f(x) = x is the only solution.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = x\"\n}",
