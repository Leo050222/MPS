Since $ a $ and $ b $ are coprime to $ 2n $, their modular inverse $ a^{-1} $ exists and is also coprime to $ 2n $. Thus, $ c = b \\\\cdot a^{-1} \\\\mod 2n $ is coprime to $ 2n $, so $ \\\\gcd(c, 2n) = 1 $. Therefore, $ d = 1 + 3 = 4 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The functional equation $ f(x^4 + y) = x^3 f(x) + f(f(y)) $ with finitely many zeros implies $ f $ must be the identity function. Setting $ x = 0 $ gives $ f(y) = f(f(y)) $, so $ f $ is a projection. Testing linear functions $ f(y) = ky $, only $ k = 1 $ satisfies the equation and the zero condition (only $ f(0) = 0 $). Further analysis shows no other functions satisfy both conditions, confirming $ f(y) = y $ is the unique solution.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=x\"\n}",
