Checking k=2: differences are 1 mod 2 (not 0). k=3: all differences mod 3 are non-zero. k=4: For m=1, n=3, 3^2 - 1^0 = 9 - 1 = 8, which is divisible by 4. Thus k=4 is the smallest such k, so s = k - 1 = 3.\\n\\nProblem 2: The sequence must satisfy a_n divisible by a_{n-1} and a_{n-2} + a_{n-1} for n ≥ 3. Starting with a₁=1, a₂=1, the minimal sequence is aₙ = (n-1)! (verified by induction and LCM conditions).
