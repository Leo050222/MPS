By denoting the common sum as S and sum of squares as Q, we derive that the sum of the overlapping elements (a1, a4, a7) must be 15 (T = 15), leading to S = 20. Through detailed analysis of valid permutations, the only consistent value for a9 across all valid configurations (considering constraints from sum and sum of squares) is 7. Thus, k = a9 - 7 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume f is linear, f(x) = mx + b. Substituting into the functional equation and equating coefficients shows m = 2 and b = 0. Verifying, f(x) = 2x satisfies the equation. Further analysis confirms no other solutions exist, as deviations from linearity lead to contradictions.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=2x\"\n}",
