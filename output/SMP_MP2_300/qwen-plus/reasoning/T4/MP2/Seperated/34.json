Setting $x=-y^2$ gives $f(0)=f(-y^2)+|yf(y)|$. Combining these, $2f(0)=f(y^2)+f(-y^2)$. Testing $y=1$ yields $f(1)=f(0)+|f(1)|$. If $f(1) \\\\geq 0$, then $f(0)=0$. If $f(1) < 0$, contradictions arise when checking consistency with other values (e.g., $y=2$), forcing $f(0)=0$. All solutions (including linear functions $f(x)=mx$ with $m \\\\geq 0$ and the zero function) have $f(0)=0$, so $k = 0 + 4 = 4$.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize circles through 4 concyclic points among 7 arbitrary points, note that two distinct circles intersect in at most 2 points. Using combinatorial design theory, the complement of the Fano plane (7 points, 7 circles, each with 4 points, pairwise intersections of 2 points) achieves the maximum. This configuration is geometrically realizable, and no more than 7 circles are possible due to intersection constraints and pair counting (each pair of points lies in exactly 2 circles, leading to $b=7$ as the only valid integer solution).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}",
