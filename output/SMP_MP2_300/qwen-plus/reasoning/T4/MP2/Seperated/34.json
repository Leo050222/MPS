Setting $ y = 0 $ gives no new information. Assuming $ f $ is linear ($ f(x) = mx $), substituting into the equation shows it holds for $ m \\\\geq 0 $. For $ f(0) $, all valid solutions (including the zero function and linear functions) yield $ f(0) = 0 $. Thus, $ k = f(0) + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The maximum number of circles through at least 4 of 7 points is constrained by the triple count: each circle with $ k \\\\geq 4 $ points uses $ \\\\binom{k}{3} $ triples, and the total number of triples from 7 points is $ \\\\binom{7}{3} = 35 $. To maximize the number of circles, set $ k = 4 $ (each circle uses $ \\\\binom{4}{3} = 4 $ triples). Solving $ 4m \\\\leq 35 $ gives $ m \\\\leq 8.75 $, so the maximum integer $ m $ is 8. This is achievable with a configuration where 8 distinct circles each contain exactly 4 points, satisfying the geometric constraints.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}",
