Instead of determining the maximum guaranteed size of a set of pairwise non-friended students across all such configurations, simply find $t = \\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) - 356$, where $\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6)$ is the maximum number of non-friendships possible among $30$ students without any $6$ who are all pairwise non-friended."

For $ \\\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) $, we avoid a $ K_6 $, so the Turán graph $ T(30, 5) $ (5-partite with equal partitions) is used. Since $ 30 = 5 \\\\times 6 $, each partition has 6 vertices. The number of edges in $ T(30, 5) $ is $ \\\\binom{5}{2} \\\\times 6^2 = 10 \\\\times 36 = 360 $. Thus, $ \\\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) = 360 $, and $ t = 360 - 356 = 4 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need all integers $ s \\\\geq 4 $ such that there exist positive integers $ a, b, c, d $ with $ s = a + b + c + d $ and $ s \\\\mid (abc + abd + acd + bcd) $. By constructing examples and analyzing divisibility, it is shown that for composite $ s \\\\geq 4 $, such integers exist (e.g., using $ a=1, b=k, c=m, d=km $ where $ s = (1+k)(1+m) $). For prime $ s \\\\geq 5 $, no such integers exist due to modular constraints. Hence, the solution is all composite integers $ s \\\\geq 4 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"all composite integers s ≥ 4\"\n}",
