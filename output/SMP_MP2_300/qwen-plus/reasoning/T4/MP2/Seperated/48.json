  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We need to find consecutive positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that both fractions are integers. For consecutive pairs where $b = a + 1$, the first fraction simplifies to 1 for any $a$, as numerator and denominator are both $a^2 + a + 1$. Valid pairs include $(1,2)$ and $(2,3)$, where the first fraction is 1. The problem specifies $k$ as the value of the first fraction for such pairs, which is consistently 1. Thus, $e = 1 + 2022 = 2023$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The polynomial $P(n)$ is the product of $(n - k^3)$ for $k = 1$ to $40$. The largest $d$ dividing $P(n)$ for all $n > 2023$ is determined by primes $p$ where cubes modulo $p$ cover all residues. These primes are $2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 23, 29$. The exponents of these primes in $d$ are calculated based on the minimal number of $k$ values for each residue class:\\n- $2^{20}$ (20 even/odd terms)\\n- $3^{13}$ (minimal residue count)\\n- $5^8$ (8 terms per residue)\\n- $11^3$, $17^2$, $23^1$, $29^1$\\nSumming exponents: $20 + 13 + 8 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 48$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2023\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"48\"\n}",
