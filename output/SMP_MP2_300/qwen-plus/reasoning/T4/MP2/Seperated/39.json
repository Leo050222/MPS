Since 2013 is odd, the left-hand side factors as $(a + b)(a^{2012} - a^{2011}b + \\\\cdots + b^{2012})$. Both factors must be powers of $p$. If $a = b$, then $2a^{2013} = p^n$, implying $p = 2$ (as 2 is prime). For $a \\\\neq b$, modular arithmetic and the lifting the exponent lemma show that any odd prime $p$ would require $2^n + 1$ to be a prime power, but Mih\\u0103ilescu's theorem confirms $2^3 + 1 = 3^2$ is the only nontrivial case, yet it fails for higher exponents. All valid solutions (e.g., $a = b = 2^k$) yield $p = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: We seek $n$ where $C(2^n + 1) = C(n)$. Testing small $n$, $n = 3$ works: $2^3 + 1 = 9$ (prime sum 3), $C(3) = 3$. For $n > 3$, $C(2^n + 1)$ exceeds $C(n)$ due to multiple prime factors in $2^n + 1$ (e.g., $n = 5$ gives $C(33) = 14 \\\\neq 5$). Even $n$ yield $C(2^n + 1) \\\\geq 5 > C(n) \\\\geq 2$. Mih\\u0103ilescu's theorem confirms $2^n + 1 = 3^m$ only for $n = 1, 3$, but $n = 1$ fails ($C(1) = 0 \\\\neq 3$). Thus, $n = 3$ is the only solution.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
