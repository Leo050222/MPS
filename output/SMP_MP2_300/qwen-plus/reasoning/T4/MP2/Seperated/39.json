When $a = b$, the equation becomes $2a^{2013} = p^n$, implying $p = 2$ since $2$ must be a power of $p$. For $a \\\\neq b$, the factorization $a^{2013} + b^{2013} = (a + b)(\\\\text{other factor})$ shows both factors must be powers of $p$. Using modular arithmetic and Mihăilescu's theorem, it is shown that no other primes $p$ can satisfy the equation. The only valid prime is $p = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need $C(2^n + 1) = C(n)$, where $C(k)$ is the sum of distinct prime divisors of $k$. Testing small $n$, $n = 3$ works: $2^3 + 1 = 9$ (prime factor $3$), so $C(9) = 3$, and $C(3) = 3$. For other $n$, $2^n + 1$ either has multiple prime factors (sum too large) or a single large prime factor (not matching $C(n)$). Mihăilescu's theorem confirms $2^n + 1$ is a prime power only for $n = 1, 3$, but only $n = 3$ satisfies the condition. No other $n$ works after checking cases and properties of $C(k)$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
