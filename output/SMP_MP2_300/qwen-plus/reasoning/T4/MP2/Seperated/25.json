  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To find $ k = b + 2 $ where $ b = f(0) $, we analyze the functional equation. Setting $ x = 0 $ gives $ f(0) + y = f(g(y)) $, implying $ f(g(y)) = y + f(0) $. This shows $ f $ is bijective. Using $ y = 0 $ and the condition $ f(0) + g(0) = 0 $, we derive $ f(1) = 1 $. Further analysis using $ f(t + 1) = f(t) + 1 $ (from bijectivity and functional properties) leads to $ f(1) = f(0) + 1 $, hence $ f(0) = 0 $. Thus $ b = 0 $, so $ k = 0 + 2 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: We test constant and linear functions. The zero function $ f(x) = 0 $ satisfies the equation. For linear $ f(x) = ax + b $, solving coefficients yields $ a = 0 $ (zero function) or $ a = 2 $ (function $ f(x) = 2x $). Non-linear solutions are ruled out via injectivity and polynomial checks. Thus, the solutions are $ f(x) = 0 $ and $ f(x) = 2x $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=0 and f(x)=2x\"\n}",
