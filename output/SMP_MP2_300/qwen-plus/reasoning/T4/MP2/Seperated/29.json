Thus, $k = f_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Solve $x^2(1 + x^2) = -1 + 21^y$ in $\\\\mathbb{Z}^2$. Rearranging gives $x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 21^y$. Testing small $y$:\\n- $y = 0$: $21^0 = 1 \\\\implies x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 1 \\\\implies x = 0$. Solution: $(0, 0)$.\\n- $y = 1$: $21^1 = 21 \\\\implies x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 21 \\\\implies x^2 = 4 \\\\implies x = \\\\pm 2$. Solutions: $(2, 1)$, $(-2, 1)$.\\n- $y \\\\geq 2$: $21^y$ grows exponentially, while $x^4 + x^2 + 1$ grows polynomially. No solutions exist for $y \\\\geq 2$ as verified by discriminant checks for quadratic in $x^2$. Negative $y$ yields non-integer RHS. Thus, all solutions are $(0, 0)$, $(2, 1)$, $(-2, 1)$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(0, 0), (2, 1), (-2, 1)\"\n}",
