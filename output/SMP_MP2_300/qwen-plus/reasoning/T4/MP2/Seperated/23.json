At any point, Evan may pick two of the numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) written on the board and write either their arithmetic mean \\(\\tfrac{x+y}{2}\\) or their harmonic mean \\(\\tfrac{2xy}{x+y}\\) on the board as well. Find all pairs \\((m,n)\\) such that Evan can write 1 on the board in finitely many steps. Instead of determining all initial pairs of relatively prime positive integers that permit writing the number 1 on the board, simply find \\(k = d + 1\\), where \\(d\\) is the odd part of the sum of the numerator and denominator for the reduced fractions initially on the board."

For such pairs, the odd part $d$ of $m + n$ is 1 (since powers of 2 have no odd factors other than 1). Thus, $k = d + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: By analyzing the functional equation, we find that the only solutions are the zero function $f(x) = 0$ and the square function $f(x) = x^2$. These satisfy the equation for all real $x, y$, and no other functions do.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=0 and f(x)=x^2\"\n}",
