At any point, Evan may pick two of the numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) written on the board and write either their arithmetic mean \\(\\tfrac{x+y}{2}\\) or their harmonic mean \\(\\tfrac{2xy}{x+y}\\) on the board as well. Find all pairs \\((m,n)\\) such that Evan can write 1 on the board in finitely many steps. Instead of determining all initial pairs of relatively prime positive integers that permit writing the number 1 on the board, simply find \\(k = d + 1\\), where \\(d\\) is the odd part of the sum of the numerator and denominator for the reduced fractions initially on the board."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The key insight is that Evan can write 1 on the board if and only if the sum $ m + n $ is a power of 2. For such pairs, the odd part $ d $ of $ m + n $ is 1 (since powers of 2 have no odd factors other than 1). Thus, $ k = d + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 $. This holds for all valid pairs $(m, n)$ where $ m $ and $ n $ are coprime and $ m + n $ is a power of 2, as verified through examples like $(1,1)$, $(1,3)$, $(3,5)$, etc.\\n\\nProblem 2: By analyzing the functional equation, we test constant and quadratic functions. The zero function $ f(x) = 0 $ satisfies the equation trivially. For quadratic functions, assuming $ f(x) = ax^2 $, we find $ a = 0 $ or $ a = 1 $ work. Verifying $ f(x) = x^2 $ confirms it satisfies the equation. No other functions (linear, non-quadratic) satisfy the equation, leading to the conclusion that the only solutions are $ f(x) = 0 $ and $ f(x) = x^2 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x^2\"\n}",
