The requirement that $a_n - g_n$ is divisible by $m$ for all $n > 1$ and $a_2 - a_1$ is not divisible by $m$ leads to constraints on the common ratio $r$ of the geometric sequence. Through modular arithmetic and prime factorization analysis, it is determined that $\\\\gcd(r, m) = 1$ in all valid cases (e.g., examples with $m = 4, 9, 12$ and $r = 3, 4, 7$ respectively). Thus, $k = \\\\gcd(r, m) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The functional equation $f(x^2 + f(y)) = f(f(x)) + f(y^2) + 2f(xy)$ is analyzed by testing constant, linear, and quadratic functions. The zero function $f(x) = 0$ and the square function $f(x) = x^2$ satisfy the equation. Polynomial analysis and substitution show no other solutions exist, as non-quadratic or non-zero/non-square functions fail to meet the equation's constraints for all real $x, y$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=0 and f(x)=x^2\"\n}",
