Using the telescoping product of consecutive integers {2, ..., 40} gives a product of 40. Replacing s=34 with s=67 adjusts the product to 670/17. The minimal n is 39, and the maximum element in this set is 67. Thus, d = 67 - 67 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: The polynomial must be homogeneous of degree n, satisfy the functional equation, and P(1,0)=1. Testing small degrees and generalizing shows the only solution is P(x,y) = (x - 2y)(x + y)^{n-1}, which meets all conditions.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(x - 2y)(x + y)^(n-1)\"\n}",
