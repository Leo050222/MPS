Thus, $ k = f(0) + 1 = 1 $. Problem 2: The integers $ n > 1 $ must divide $ x^{13} - x $ for all $ x $. By Fermat's Little Theorem and properties of cyclic groups, $ n $ must be square-free with prime factors $ p $ where $ p-1 $ divides 12. The valid primes are $ \\\\{2, 3, 5, 7, 13\\\\} $. The number of non-empty subsets of these 5 primes is $ 2^5 - 1 = 31 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"31\"\n}",
