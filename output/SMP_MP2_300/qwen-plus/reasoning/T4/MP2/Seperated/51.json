At least one pair is linked by air, at least one pair by bus and at least one pair by train. No town has an air link, a bus link and a train link. No three towns, $A, B, C$ are such that the links between $AB, AC$ and $BC$ are all air, all bus or all train. Instead of determining the maximum number of towns that satisfy the connectivity and link constraints, simply find $k = n - 2$, where $n$ is the largest such number of towns."

Through graph theory analysis, the maximum $ n $ is determined to be 4. This is verified by constructing a valid configuration with 4 towns (two partitions of size 2, cross edges as air, within-partition edges as bus and train), which satisfies all constraints. Larger configurations (e.g., $ n = 5 $) inevitably lead to monochromatic triangles or towns with all three link types. Thus, $ k = n - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The functional equation $ f(x^2 - y) + 2yf(x) = f(f(x)) + f(y) $ is solved by testing constant, linear, and quadratic functions. Constant $ f(x) = 0 $ works. Quadratic functions $ f(x) = x^2 $ and $ f(x) = -x^2 $ satisfy the equation for all real $ x, y $. Non-quadratic solutions are ruled out via substitution and degree analysis. Verification confirms these are the only solutions.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=0, f(x)=x^2, f(x)=-x^2\"\n}",
