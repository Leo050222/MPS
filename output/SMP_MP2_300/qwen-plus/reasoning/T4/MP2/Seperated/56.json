The floor function $\\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\rfloor$ changes only when $n+1$ is a perfect square (i.e., $n = m^2 - 1$). For $n \\\\neq m^2 - 1$, $\\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\rfloor = \\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt{n+1} \\\\rfloor$, so $P(n) = P(n+1)$. However, since $n$ and $n+1$ are coprime, their greatest prime divisors cannot be equal, so no solutions exist in this case. For $n = m^2 - 1$, the equation becomes $P(m^2 - 1) = P(m) + 1$. Testing small values of $m$, we find $m=2$ gives $n=3$, where $P(3)=3$ and $P(4)=2$, satisfying $3 + 1 = 2 + 2$. No other $m$ works. Thus, $n=3$, $p=3$, and $k = p + 11 = 14$.\\n\\nProblem 2: We solve $20^x + 14^{2y} = (x + 2y + z)^{zt}$. Testing small values, $x=1$, $y=1$ gives $20 + 196 = 216 = 6^3$. Here, $x + 2y + z = 6 \\\\Rightarrow z=3$, and $zt=3 \\\\Rightarrow t=1$. Checking other values of $x, y, z, t$ shows no additional solutions. Thus, the only quadruple is $(1, 1, 3, 1)$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"14\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(1,1,3,1)\"\n}",
