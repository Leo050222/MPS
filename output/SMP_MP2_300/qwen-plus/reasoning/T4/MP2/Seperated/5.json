Testing small integers, n=6 (prime factors 2 and 3) satisfies σ(6)=12, p(n)=3, and 12/(3-1)=6. No other integers meet the condition. The distinct prime factors of n=6 are 2 and 3, so k=2. Thus, e=k-1=1.\\n\\nProblem 2: n must be a sum of two coprime squares with all primes ≤√n dividing ab. Checking small values: n=2 (1²+1², no primes ≤√2), n=5 (1²+2², prime 2 ≤√5 divides 2), and n=13 (2²+3², primes 2,3 ≤√13 divide 6) satisfy the condition. Larger n fail as primes ≤√n exceed ab's divisors. Thus, the solutions are 2, 5, 13.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2,5,13\"\n}",
