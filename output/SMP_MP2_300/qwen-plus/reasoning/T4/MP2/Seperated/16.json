By examining leading terms for non-constant polynomials (degree $d \\\\geq 1$), the leading coefficient comparison shows $T = 2$. For constant polynomials ($P = Q = 1$), $T = 3$, but the problem context implies non-trivial solutions where $T$ is uniquely derived from divisibility conditions, leading to $T = 2$ as the consistent value for non-constant cases, which are the primary focus.\\n\\nProblem 2: For positive integers $n$, we need $k \\\\geq 2$ positive rationals summing and multiplying to $n$. Using AM-GM, primes $n \\\\geq 2$ fail due to insufficient flexibility. Composite $n \\\\geq 4$ work by constructing solutions with two factors $a, b \\\\geq 2$ (e.g., $n = ab$) and $n - a - b$ copies of 1, ensuring rationality. Examples like $n = 4$ (with $k=2$), $n = 6$ (with $k=3$), etc., confirm all composite $n \\\\geq 4$ are valid, while primes and $n < 4$ fail.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"all composite positive integers\"\n}",
