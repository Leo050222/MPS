All three methods of transportation are used in the county with no community being serviced by all three modes and no three communities being linked pairwise by the same mode. Determine the largest number of communities in this county. Instead of determining the largest number of communities in this county, simply find $k = c(uv) - 2$, where $c(uv)$ is the label of the mode of transportation linking two communities both serviced only by the modes labeled 1 and 3."

The maximum number of communities (vertices) is 4. Communities serviced only by modes 1 and 3 (class B) have edges between them colored 3 (to avoid monochromatic triangles with other classes). Thus, c(uv)=3, so k=3-2=1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Testing small values and inequalities shows f(x) ≥ x. Using y=1 gives f(x) + f(f(x)) ≤ 2x, which combined with f(x) ≥ x forces f(x)=x. Verifying confirms f(x)=x satisfies the inequality for all x,y.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=x\"\n}",
