Instead of computing the weighted sum $1000a + 100b + 10c + d$ derived from the simplified radical expression for the largest possible value of the product $xyz$, simply find $k = d - 1$, where $d$ is the positive denominator in that fractional expression for the largest possible $xyz$."

By manipulating the equations and using the identity for $ (1+x)(1+y)(1+z) $, we derive the cubic equation $ S^3 - 9S^2 + 22S - 8 = 0 $. Factoring gives roots $ S = 4 $, $ S = \\\\frac{5 + \\\\sqrt{17}}{2} $, and $ S = \\\\frac{5 - \\\\sqrt{17}}{2} $. The largest root is $ \\\\frac{5 + \\\\sqrt{17}}{2} $, where the denominator $ d = 2 $. The problem asks for $ k = d - 1 $, so $ k = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The function $ f(x) $ is analyzed for iterates. For $ f^{10}(x) = 1 $, since 10 is even, the solutions are the pre-images of the 2nd iterate, which are $ x = 1 $ and $ x = -\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3} + 1}{2} $. Their sum is $ \\\\frac{1 - \\\\sqrt{3}}{2} $, corresponding to $ a = 1 $, $ b = -1 $, $ c = 3 $, $ d = 2 $.
