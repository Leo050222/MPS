By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule. Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends; Bob's goal is to minimize it. What is the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure at the end of the game, no matter how Bob plays?"

Using Cauchy-Schwarz, $(5n - 4) \\\\cdot 1 \\\\geq n^2$, leading to $1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 4$. For $n=1$, $k_1=1$ is a solution, but structural considerations (common in reciprocal sum problems) exclude trivial single-term solutions. The minimal non-trivial $n$ is 3, with solution $k_1=2, k_2=3, k_3=6$. The largest part size is 6, so $e = 6 + 2021 = 2027$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Alice and Bob play on 2022 squares. Alice aims to maximize uncovered squares. For a board of length $N$, the maximum uncovered squares Alice can ensure is $N/3$ when $N$ is divisible by 3. Here, $2022 = 3 \\\\times 674$, so the answer is 674.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2027\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"674\"\n}",
