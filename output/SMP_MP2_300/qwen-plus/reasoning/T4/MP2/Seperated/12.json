      "A3214": "Alice and Bob play a game on a board consisting of one row of 2022 consecutive squares. They take turns placing tiles that cover two adjacent squares, with Alice going first. By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule. Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends; Bob's goal is to minimize it. What is the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure at the end of the game, no matter how Bob plays?"

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we find $n \\\\leq 4$. For $n=1$, $k_1=1$ satisfies both conditions, but this is trivial. For $n=4$, all $k_i=4$ gives $4 \\\\cdot 4 = 16 = 5 \\\\cdot 4 - 4$ and $4 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{4} = 1$, which is a valid non-trivial solution with equal part sizes. The problem specifies 'structural consideration of minimal number of terms' implying non-trivial solutions where all parts are equal and greater than 1. Thus, the smallest $n$ with equal parts $>1$ is $n=4$, giving $k=4$. Hence, $e = 4 + 2021 = 2025$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Alice aims to maximize uncovered squares on a 1x2022 board. By placing her first domino to split the board into two odd-length segments (e.g., positions 2-3), each segment will have at least 1 uncovered square due to their odd lengths. This ensures 2 uncovered squares regardless of Bob's play. For even $n \\\\geq 4$, this strategy guarantees 2 uncovered squares, which is the maximum Alice can ensure.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2025\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\"\n}",
