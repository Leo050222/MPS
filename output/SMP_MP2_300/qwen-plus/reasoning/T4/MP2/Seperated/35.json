Using this, f(47) is calculated as follows: 47 in binary is 101111, which corresponds to m=5 (since 2^5=32 ≤ 47 < 64) and k=15. f(15)=40 (from prior computations), so f(47)=3^5 + 40=243+40=283. Thus, t=283-278=5.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find the extrema of S=(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+e)(e+a) with a,b,c,d,e ≥ -1 and sum 5. For maximum, setting three consecutive variables to -1 (e.g., a=b=c=-1) and the other two to 4 (d=e=4) gives S=(-2)(-2)(3)(8)(3)=288. For minimum, setting four variables to -1 (e.g., a=b=c=d=-1) and the fifth to 9 (e=9) gives S=(-2)^3(8)(8)=-512. These are confirmed as the global extrema through boundary analysis and symmetry checks.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-512,288\"\n}",
