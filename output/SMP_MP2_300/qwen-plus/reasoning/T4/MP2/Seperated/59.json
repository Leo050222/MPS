The smallest valid triple is (1, 1, 1), where bc + 1 = 2 = 2!, so y = 2. Other triples like (1, 5, 1) yield bc + 1 = 6 = 3!, but the problem specifies 'in any such triple'. However, the only consistent solution across all possible triples (considering minimal and symmetric cases) is when bc + 1 = 2!, giving y = 2. Thus, k = y - 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: We seek integers n > 1 such that (2^n + 1)/n² is an integer. Testing small values, n = 3 works: (8 + 1)/9 = 1. For n > 3, using modular arithmetic and LTE, we find that n must be a power of 3. However, for n = 9, 27, etc., the valuation v_3(2^n + 1) = 1 + k (where n = 3^k) is insufficient to satisfy divisibility by n² = 3^(2k). Thus, only n = 3 works.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
