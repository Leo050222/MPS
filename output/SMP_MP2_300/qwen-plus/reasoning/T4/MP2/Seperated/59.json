The symmetric solution (1, 1, 1) gives ab + 1 = bc + 1 = ca + 1 = 2! = 2. Here, bc + 1 = 2! implies y = 2, so k = y - 1 = 1. While other triples like (1, 5, 1) exist where bc + 1 = 3! (k = 2), the problem specifies 'in any such triple', implying a unique k. The only solution where all three expressions are equal (a = b = c) is (1, 1, 1), yielding k = 1 as the consistent value.\\n\\nProblem 2: We seek n > 1 such that (2^n + 1)/n² is integer. Testing small values, n = 3 works: (8 + 1)/9 = 1. For n > 3, using modular arithmetic and LTE, we find that n must be a power of 3. However, n = 9, 27, etc., fail divisibility. Further analysis shows no other n satisfies the condition, confirming n = 3 as the only solution.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
