  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The equation 4b² - 3a² = 1 is transformed into the Pell equation x² - 3y² = 1 with x = 2b and y = a. The fundamental solution for Pell equations with D=3 is (2, 1), but we need a > 1. The next solutions are generated by (2 + √3)^k. For k=3, we get x=26 (even, so b=13) and y=15 (a=15). Checking smaller a values confirms a=15 is the smallest valid solution. Thus, d = 15 - 14 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given z⁵ + 2004z = 1, we derive the polynomial for w = z². From z⁵ = 1 - 2004z, we find z = 1/(w² + 2004) and substitute into w = z² to get w(w² + 2004)² = 1, expanding to P(w) = w⁵ + 2·2004w³ + 2004²w - 1. Calculating P(1) = 2004·2006 = 2005² - 1 and P(-1) = -(2005² + 1), the ratio simplifies to -(2005² - 1)/(2005² + 1) = -2010012/2010013.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-2010012/2010013\"\n}",
