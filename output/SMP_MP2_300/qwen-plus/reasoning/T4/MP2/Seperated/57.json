Instead of identifying all positive integer pairs that simultaneously divide the exponential expression depending on their absolute difference, simply find $k = f(1) - 11$, where $f(d) = 9^d + 3^d + 1$ is the expression that must be divisible by both integers when $d$ is their absolute difference."

Thus, k = 13 - 11 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given constraints a + b + c + d = 2 and ab + bc + cd + da + ac + bd = 0, we analyze symmetric cases. For maximum abcd, consider two pairs of equal variables: a = b = (1 + √3)/2, c = d = (1 - √3)/2, yielding abcd = 1/4. For minimum abcd, consider three variables as 1 and one as -1, giving abcd = -1. These are confirmed as extrema through substitution and optimization.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-1, 1/4\"\n}",
