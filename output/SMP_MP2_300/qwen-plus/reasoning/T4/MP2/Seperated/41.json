      "A390": "Two players, $B$ and $R$ , play the following game on an infinite grid of unit squares, all initially colored white. The players take turns starting with $B$ . On $B$ 's turn, $B$ selects one white unit square and colors it blue. On $R$ 's turn, $R$ selects two white unit squares and colors them red. The players alternate until $B$ decides to end the game. At this point, $B$ gets a score, given by the number of unit squares in the largest (in terms of area) simple polygon containing only blue unit squares. What is the largest score $B$ can guarantee?\n(A simple polygon is a polygon (not necessarily convex) that does not intersect itself and has no holes.) Instead of determining the largest score $B$ can guarantee, simply find $m = |P_i| - 2$, where $|P_i|$ is the number of unit squares in each of the disjoint $2 \\times 2$ blocks into which the grid is partitioned to analyze the connectivity of blue squares."

The problem defines $ m = |P_i| - 2 $, where $ |P_i| $ is the number of unit squares in each block. Since each block has 4 squares, $ |P_i| = 4 $, so $ m = 4 - 2 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: We solve $ z + y^2 + x^3 = xyz $ with $ x = \\\\gcd(y, z) $.
