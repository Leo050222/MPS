  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We are given positive integers $a, b, c, d, m, n$ such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1989$, $a + b + c + d = m^2$, and the largest of $a, b, c, d$ is $n^2$. Let $L = n^2$ be the largest number. Since $L^2 \\\\leq 1989$, $L \\\\leq 44$. As $L$ must be a perfect square (since $L = n^2$), possible values for $L$ are $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36$ (since $7^2 = 49 > 44$).\\n\\nTesting $L = 36$ (i.e., $n = 6$): $d = 36$, so $d^2 = 1296$. The remaining sum of squares is $1989 - 1296 = 693$. The sum of the other three numbers is $m^2 - 36$. Using Cauchy-Schwarz, $3 \\\\times 693 \\\\geq (m^2 - 36)^2$, so $m^2 \\\\leq 81$, hence $m \\\\leq 9$. Testing combinations, $a = 12$, $b = 15$, $c = 18$, $d = 36$ gives sum $12 + 15 + 18 + 36 = 81 = 9^2$ and sum of squares $144 + 225 + 324 + 1296 = 1989$. Thus, $n = 6$, so $k = n - 6 = 0$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The functional equation $f(a)^2 + f(b)^2 + f(c)^2 = 2f(a)f(b) + 2f(b)f(c) + 2f(c)f(a)$ for all $a + b + c = 0$ is analyzed. Setting $c = -a - b$, the equation becomes $(f(a) - f(b) - f(c))^2 = 4f(b)f(c)$. Testing constant functions shows only $f(n) = 0$ works. For quadratic functions $f(n) = kn^2$, the identity $a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = 2a^2b^2 + 2b^2c^2 + 2c^2a^2$ holds when $a + b + c = 0$, so $f(n) = kn^2$ satisfies the equation for any integer $k$. Non-quadratic solutions like odd-even functions were considered but found to either reduce to the quadratic case or fail under deeper analysis (e.g., requiring $f$ to be constant on odd integers, which conflicts with the equation's structure for general $a, b, c$). The only consistent solutions are $f(n) = kn^2$ for integer $k$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(n) = k n^2 for some integer k\"\n}",
