  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The equation involves gcd terms. Assuming gcd(a, b) = 1, the sum becomes (x+1)(y+1) = 200 where x = gcd(a, c), y = gcd(b, c). Factor pairs of 200 give possible x, y. The term (c, ab) = xy, and c must be a multiple of xy. Testing factor pairs, when x=7, y=24 (or vice versa), xy=168. To satisfy m = c - 476, c=504 (168*3) gives m=28. This is the unique solution as other multiples don't align with the problem's requirement for a specific m.\\n\\nProblem 2: For nonnegative reals, using the inequality i x_i - x_i^i ≤ i - 1 with equality iff x_i=1. Summing both equations shows equality holds only when all x_i=1, satisfying both equations.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"28\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"x_i = 1 for all i\"\n}",
