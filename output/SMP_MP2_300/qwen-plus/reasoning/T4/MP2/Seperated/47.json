  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The functional equation modulo 17 involves analyzing the squaring map's structure. The recurrence sequence for non-uniform assignments (where root values allow multiple choices) follows a pattern where each level's assignments square the previous count. The second term $a_2$ in this recurrence (starting from $a_0=1$, $a_1=2$) is 4. Thus, $e = 4 + 2012 = 2016$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The functional equation $f(x)f(y) = f(x-y)$ implies $f(x)^2 = f(0)$. If $f(0) = 0$, $f$ is identically zero. If $f(0) = 1$, $f(x) = 1$ for all $x$ (non-constant solutions lead to contradictions). Thus, $f(2017)$ can only be 0 or 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2016\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"0,1\"\n}",
