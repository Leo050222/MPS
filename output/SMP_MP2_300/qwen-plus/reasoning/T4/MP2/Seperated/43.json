Here, side CA (b) is opposite ∠ABC (B), so b = 4 sin B. Since ∠ABC ≥ 90°, sin B ≤ 1 (with equality when B = 90°). The problem states that x is a real root of the quartic equation x⁴ + ax³ + bx² + cx + 1 = 0 (a=BC, b=CA, c=AB). Analysis shows that real roots can only exist if the triangle is right-angled at B (B = 90°), as obtuse angles lead to contradictions in the quartic's real root conditions. When B = 90°, AC is the diameter of the circumscribed circle, so b = 2R = 4. Thus, k = b + 2013 = 4 + 2013 = 2017.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need to count ordered arrays (x₁,..., x₁₀₀) with xᵢ ∈ {1,..., 2017} such that 2017 divides both the sum and the sum of squares. Let p = 2017 (prime). Using character sums and properties of finite fields, the number of solutions to Σxᵢ ≡ 0 mod p and Σxᵢ² ≡ 0 mod p is p^{n-2} for n variables. Here, n = 100, so the count is 2017^{98}.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2017\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2017^98\"\n}",
