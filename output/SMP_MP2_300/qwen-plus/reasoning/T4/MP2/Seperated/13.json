Considering all positive integers $N$ with this property, what is the smallest positive integer $a$ that occurs in any of these expressions? Instead of identifying the minimal initial term in the unique representation of such $N$ as a sum of consecutive positive integers, simply find $d = a - 15$, where $a$ is the smallest positive integer serving as the initial term in any such representation derived from the condition that $N$ admits no other decompositions into consecutive sums for $k>1$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The sum of 2017 consecutive positive integers starting at $a$ is $N = 2017a + \\\\frac{2017 \\\\cdot 2016}{2} = 2017(a + 1008)$. Thus, $N = 2017M$ where $M = a + 1008 > 1008$. For $N$ to have no other representations as sums of $k > 1$ consecutive positive integers, $N$ must not be expressible for any $k \\\\neq 2017$. Key observations:\\n- If $N$ is odd, it can be written as a sum of two consecutive integers (invalid), so $N$ must be even, implying $M$ is even.\\n- The odd divisors of $N$ must only include 2017 (since 2017 is prime) to avoid other odd $k$. This requires $M$ to be a power of 2 (to eliminate other odd factors).\\n- The smallest $M > 1008$ that is a power of 2 is $1024 = 2^{10}$, giving $a = M - 1008 = 16$. Verifying, $N = 2017 \\\\cdot 1024$ has no other valid $k > 1$ representations. Thus, $d = a - 15 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The condition requires that for all $m$ coprime to $n$, the map $k \\\\mapsto mk \\\\mod n$ is a square in the symmetric group on $\\\\{1, \\\\dots, n\\\\}$. For $n > 2$, the map $k \\\\mapsto -k \\\\mod n$ (valid since $-1$ is coprime to $n$) has an odd number of transpositions in its cycle decomposition (e.g., $n=3$ gives one transposition), which cannot be a square. Only $n=1$ and $n=2$ satisfy the condition:\\n- $n=1$: Trivially true (only one element).\\n- $n=2$: The only $m$ coprime to 2 is $m=1$, and the identity permutation works.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1, 2\"\n}",
