By setting variables x=a-1, y=b-1, z=c-1 with xyz=4, we minimize a²+b²+c². Testing symmetric and asymmetric cases, the minimum occurs when a=2, b=c=-1, yielding a²+b²+c²=6.\\n\\nProblem 2: Analyzing the divisibility conditions, we find that the only valid solution for the ordered pair (p, q')=(29, 5) leads to q=13. Thus, k=q-11=2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
