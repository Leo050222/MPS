Given \\\\(d(n) = 1992\\\\), we need \\\\(\\\\phi(n) \\\\mid n\\\\). Numbers satisfying \\\\(\\\\phi(n) \\\\mid n\\\\) are of the form \\\\(2^a\\\\) or \\\\(2^a 3^b\\\\) (with \\\\(a \\\\geq 1\\\\), \\\\(b \\\\geq 1\\\\)). The largest such \\\\(n\\\\) with \\\\(d(n) = 1992\\\\) is \\\\(2^{1991}\\\\) (since powers of 2 yield larger \\\\(n\\\\) than combinations with 3). The exponent \\\\(k\\\\) of 2 in \\\\(n = 2^{1991}\\\\) is 1991. Thus, \\\\(e = k - 1990 = 1\\\\).\\n\\nProblem 2: Let \\\\(t = |x - y|\\\\), so the equation becomes \\\\(\\\\sqrt[3]{7x^2 - 13xy + 7y^2} = t + 1\\\\). Cubing both sides and substituting \\\\(x = y + t\\\\) (assuming \\\\(x \\\\geq y\\\\)) leads to \\\\(y^2 + ty + 7t^2 = (t + 1)^3\\\\). Solving for integer solutions, valid pairs are found when \\\\(t = 0, 6, 12, \\\\ldots\\\\). The positive integer solutions are \\\\((1, 1)\\\\), \\\\((7, 13)\\\\), \\\\((13, 7)\\\\), \\\\((29, 41)\\\\), \\\\((41, 29)\\\\), etc. However, in competition problems, typically only small solutions are expected.
