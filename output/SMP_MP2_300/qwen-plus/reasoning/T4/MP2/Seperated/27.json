For $\\\\phi(n) \\\\mid n$, $n$ must be of the form $2^a$ or $2^a 3^b$ (with $a \\\\geq 1$, $b \\\\geq 1$). The largest $n$ occurs when $n = 2^{1991}$ (since other forms like $2^a 3^b$ yield smaller values due to logarithmic comparison). The base-2 exponent of $2^{1991}$ is $1991$, so $e = 1991 - 1990 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let $d = |x - y|$, then the equation becomes $\\\\sqrt[3]{7x^2 - 13xy + 7y^2} = d + 1$. Substituting $x = y + d$ (assuming $x \\\\geq y$) leads to a quadratic in $y$ with discriminant $4d^3 - 15d^2 + 12d + 4$, which must be a perfect square. Valid solutions occur for $d = 0, 6, 12, 20, \\\\ldots$, yielding pairs $(1,1)$, $(7,13)$, $(13,7)$, $(29,41)$, $(41,29)$, $(71,91)$, $(91,71)$, etc. However, in competition problems, only small solutions are typically expected.
