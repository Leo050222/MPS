On the second day two medals and $\\frac{1}{7}$ of the remaining medals were awarded, and so on. On the last day, the remaining $n$ medals were awarded. How many medals did the meeting last, and what was the total number of medals ? Instead of determining the total number of medals and the number of days the meeting lasted, simply find $k = c - 35$, where $c$ is the constant term in the linear particular solution derived from the sequential awarding process for the remaining medals."
