On the second day two medals and $\\frac{1}{7}$ of the remaining medals were awarded, and so on. On the last day, the remaining $n$ medals were awarded. How many medals did the meeting last, and what was the total number of medals ? Instead of determining the total number of medals and the number of days the meeting lasted, simply find $k = c - 35$, where $c$ is the constant term in the linear particular solution derived from the sequential awarding process for the remaining medals."

Assuming a linear particular solution $x_k^p = ak + b$, solving gives $a = -6$ and $b = 42$. The constant term $c$ is 42, so $k = c - 35 = 7$. Problem 2: The equation $(2x+1)^3 + 1 = y^4$ has a solution at $x = -1$, $y = 0$ since $(-1)^3 + 1 = 0 = 0^4$. Thus, integer solutions exist.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"7\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"yes\"\n}",
