Instead of finding the floor of the product of the next successive integer and the value of $P$ evaluated at that integer, simply find $d = Q(0) + 5$, where $Q(x) = x^{2} P(x) - 1$ is the auxiliary polynomial derived from the given interpolation condition."

Evaluating at x = 0, Q(0) = 0²P(0) - 1 = -1. Thus, d = Q(0) + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let roots be a, b, c, d with ab = -32. By Vieta: abcd = -1984 ⇒ cd = (-1984)/(-32) = 62. Sum of roots: a + b + c + d = 18. Sum of products three at a time: ab(c + d) + cd(a + b) = -200. Let S = a + b, T = c + d. Then S + T = 18 and -32T + 62S = -200. Solving gives S = 4, T = 14. Then k = ab + cd + (a + b)(c + d) = -32 + 62 + 4*14 = 86.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"86\"\n}",
