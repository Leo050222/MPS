Equating both sides: 2P(1)^2 = P(1)^2 ⇒ P(1)^2 = 0 ⇒ P(1) = 0. Thus k = 0 + 2003 = 2003.\\n\\nProblem 2: Consider 4004 positive integers where 2002 are congruent to 1 mod 2003 and 2002 are congruent to 2 mod 2003. For any subset of 2003 numbers, let k be the count of 1s (1 ≤ k ≤ 2002). The sum is k*1 + (2003−k)*2 = 4006 − k ≡ −k mod 2003. Since k ∈ [1, 2002], −k ≢ 0 mod 2003. Hence, no subset sum is divisible by 2003. Answer is 'Yes'.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2003\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"Yes\"\n}",
