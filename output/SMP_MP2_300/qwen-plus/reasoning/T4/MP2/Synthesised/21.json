  "math_problem": "Find all functions $f:\\mathbb{Z}\\to \\mathbb{Z}$ with the following property: if $x+y+z=0$, then $f(x)+f(y)+f(z)=xyz$. Instead of finding all integer-valued functions on the integers satisfying the given functional equation, simply find $k = f(0) + 1$, where $f(0)$ is the value at zero for any such function. How many integers $n>k$ are there such that $n$ divides $x^{13}-x$ for every positive integer $x$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the functional equation: for all integers $ x, y, z $ such that $ x + y + z = 0 $, it must hold that\\n$$\\nf(x) + f(y) + f(z) = xyz.\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine $ f(0) $\\n\\nLet $ x = y = z = 0 $. Then $ x + y + z = 0 $, so the condition becomes:\\n$$\\nf(0) + f(0) + f(0) = 0 \\\\cdot 0 \\\\cdot 0 = 0 \\\\Rightarrow 3f(0) = 0 \\\\Rightarrow f(0) = 0.\\n$$\\nThus, $ k = f(0) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 $.\\n\\n### Step 2: Analyze the Functional Equation Further\\n\\nAssume a general solution of the form $ f(x) = \\\\frac{x^3 - x}{3} + cx $, where $ c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} $. This satisfies the identity:\\n$$\\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3xyz \\\\quad \\\\text{when } x + y + z = 0,\\n$$\\nwhich is a known algebraic identity. Therefore,\\n$$\\nf(x) + f(y) + f(z) = \\\\frac{x^3 - x + y^3 - y + z^3 - z}{3} = \\\\frac{3xyz - (x + y + z)}{3} = xyz,\\n$$\\nsince $ x + y + z = 0 $. Thus, this function satisfies the given condition.\\n\\nMoreover, any deviation from this form (e.g., adding a linear term $ cx $) still preserves the condition because the linear part cancels out due to the symmetry in the equation. However, regardless of the value of $ c $, $ f(0) = 0 $ always holds. Hence, $ k = 1 $ is fixed.\\n\\n### Step 3: Count Integers $ n > k $ Dividing $ x^{13} - x $ for All Positive Integers $ x $\\n\\nWe are now tasked with finding how many integers $ n > 1 $ divide $ x^{13} - x $ for **every** positive integer $ x $.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to finding all square-free integers $ n > 1 $ such that for every prime $ p \\\\mid n $, $ p - 1 \\\\mid 12 $, since:\\n- By Fermat's Little Theorem, $ x^{p-1} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod p $ for $ x \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod p $,\\n- So $ x^{13} \\\\equiv x \\\\mod p $ if and only if $ 13 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod (p - 1) $, i.e., $ p - 1 \\\\mid 12 $.\\n\\nThe primes satisfying $ p - 1 \\\\mid 12 $ are:\\n$$\\np \\\\in \\\\{2, 3, 5, 7, 13\\\\},\\n$$\\nsince:\\n- $ p = 2 \\\\Rightarrow p - 1 = 1 $,\\n- $ p = 3 \\\\Rightarrow p - 1 = 2 $,\\n- $ p = 5 \\\\Rightarrow p - 1 = 4 $,\\n- $ p = 7 \\\\Rightarrow p - 1 = 6 $,\\n- $ p = 13 \\\\Rightarrow p - 1 = 12 $.\\n\\nAll other primes fail this condition (e.g., $ p = 11 \\\\Rightarrow p - 1 = 10 $, which does not divide 12).\\n\\nNow, the set of all such $ n > 1 $ consists of all **square-free products** of these five primes. Since $ n $ must be square-free and composed only of these primes, the total number of such $ n $ is the number of non-empty subsets of the set $ \\\\{2, 3, 5, 7, 13\\\\} $.\\n\\nThere are $ 2^5 = 32 $ subsets of a 5-element set, and excluding the empty subset (which corresponds to $ n = 1 $), we get:\\n$$\\n32 - 1 = 31 \\\\text{ valid values of } n > 1.\\n$$\",\n    \"answer\": \"31\"\n}",
