  "math_problem": "Given $30$ students such that each student has at most $5$ friends and for every $5$ students there is a pair of students that are not friends, determine the maximum $k$ such that for all such possible configurations, there exists $k$ students who are all not friends. Instead of determining the maximum guaranteed size of a set of pairwise non-friended students across all such configurations, simply find $t = \\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) - 356$, where $\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6)$ is the maximum number of non-friendships possible among $30$ students without any $6$ who are all pairwise non-friended. Determine all integers $s \\ge t$ for which there exist positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ such that $s = a+b+c+d$ and $s$ divides $abc+abd+acd+bcd$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires determining all integers $ s \\\\ge t $ where $ t = \\\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) - 356 $. First, $ \\\\mathrm{ex}(30, K_6) $ is the Turán number for $ K_6 $, which gives the maximum number of edges in a $ K_6 $-free graph on 30 vertices. Using Turán's theorem, the Turán graph $ T(30, 5) $ (complete 5-partite graph with equal partitions) has $ \\\\frac{30^2 - 5 \\\\cdot 6^2}{2} = 360 $ edges. Thus, $ t = 360 - 356 = 4 $.\\n\\nNext, we need to find all integers $ s \\\\ge 4 $ such that there exist positive integers $ a, b, c, d $ with $ s = a + b + c + d $ and $ s \\\\mid (abc + abd + acd + bcd) $. Through analysis:\\n- For $ s = 4 $: $ (1,1,1,1) $ works ($ 4 \\\\mid 4 $).\\n- For $ s = 5 $: No valid tuples (e.g., $ (2,1,1,1) $ gives sum of products 7, not divisible by 5).\\n- For $ s = 6 $: $ (2,2,1,1) $ works ($ 6 \\\\mid 12 $).\\n- For $ s = 7 $: No valid tuples (e.g., $ (2,2,2,1) $ gives sum of products 20, not divisible by 7).\\n- For $ s \\\\ge 8 $: Valid tuples exist (e.g., $ s = 8 $: $ (1,1,1,5) $; $ s = 9 $: $ (1,1,2,5) $; etc.).\\n\\nThis pattern holds because for $ s \\\\ge 8 $, constructions like symmetric partitions or specific combinations ensure divisibility, while $ s = 5 $ and $ s = 7 $ are the only exceptions due to their prime nature and limited partition options.\",\n    \"answer\": \"all integers s ≥ 4 except 5 and 7\"\n}",
