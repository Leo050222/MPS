  "math_problem": "Two rational numbers \\(\\tfrac{m}{n}\\) and \\(\\tfrac{n}{m}\\) are written on a blackboard, where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime positive integers. At any point, Evan may pick two of the numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) written on the board and write either their arithmetic mean \\(\\tfrac{x+y}{2}\\) or their harmonic mean \\(\\tfrac{2xy}{x+y}\\) on the board as well. Find all pairs \\((m,n)\\) such that Evan can write 1 on the board in finitely many steps. Instead of determining all initial pairs of relatively prime positive integers that permit writing the number 1 on the board, simply find \\(k = d + 1\\), where \\(d\\) is the odd part of the sum of the numerator and denominator for the reduced fractions initially on the board. Determine all the functions \\(f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) such that\n\\[ f(x^k + f(y)) = f(f(x)) + f(y^k) + 2f(xy) \\]\nfor all real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two parts. First, determining k for the blackboard problem, then solving a functional equation with that k.\\n\\nFor the blackboard problem, initial numbers are m/n and n/m with m, n coprime. Evan can write 1 if and only if m + n is a power of 2. The odd part of m + n (which is a power of 2) is 1, so k = d + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\\n\\nFor the functional equation with k = 2:\\nf(x² + f(y)) = f(f(x)) + f(y²) + 2f(xy)\\n\\nTesting constant functions: f(x) = 0 works. Testing quadratic functions: f(x) = x² works. Polynomial analysis shows only these solutions. Non-polynomial solutions are ruled out by functional equation structure. Thus, the solutions are f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x².\",\n    \"answer\": \"f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x^2\"\n}",
