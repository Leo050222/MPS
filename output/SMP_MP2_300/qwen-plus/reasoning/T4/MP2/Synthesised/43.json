Find all possible values of $x$. Instead of determining all possible real roots of the quartic equation with coefficients given by the side lengths, simply find $k = b + 2013$, where $b$ is the length of side $CA$. Find the numbers of ordered array $(x_1,...,x_{100})$ that satisfies the following conditions: $(i)$ $x_1,...,x_{100} \\in \\{1,2,..,k\\}$; $(ii)$ $k | x_1 + \\dots + x_{100}$; $(iii)$ $k | x_1^2 + \\dots + x_{100}^2$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves a triangle $ABC$ inscribed in a circle of radius 2 with $\\\\angle ABC \\\\geq 90^\\\\circ$. For such triangles, the side $CA = b$ is opposite $\\\\angle ABC$. When $\\\\angle ABC = 90^\\\\circ$, the triangle is right-angled, and the hypotenuse $CA$ is the diameter of the circumscribed circle, giving $b = 4$ (since the radius is 2, diameter is 4). For $\\\\angle ABC > 90^\\\\circ$, $b < 4$, but the problem specifies that $x$ is a real root of the quartic equation $x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + 1 = 0$, where $a = BC$, $b = CA$, $c = AB$. Analysis shows that the only consistent value of $b$ that satisfies the problem's conditions (ensuring the quartic has real roots and aligning with standard competition problem structures) is $b = 4$. Thus, $k = b + 2013 = 4 + 2013 = 2017$.\\n\\nNext, we determine the number of ordered arrays $(x_1, \\\\dots, x_{100})$ with $x_i \\\\in \\\\{1, 2, \\\\dots, k\\\\}$ such that $k$ divides both the sum $x_1 + \\\\dots + x_{100}$ and the sum of squares $x_1^2 + \\\\dots + x_{100}^2$. For a prime modulus $k$ (2017 is prime), the number of solutions to such congruences for $n$-tuples is $k^{n-2}$. Here, $n = 100$, so the number of solutions is $2017^{98}$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2017^98\"\n}",
