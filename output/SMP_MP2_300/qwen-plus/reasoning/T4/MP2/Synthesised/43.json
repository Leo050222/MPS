  "math_problem": "Triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in a circle of radius $2$ with $\\angle ABC \\geq 90^\\circ$, and $x$ is a real number satisfying the equation $x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + 1 = 0$, where $a=BC$, $b=CA$, $c=AB$. Find all possible values of $x$. Instead of determining all possible real roots of the quartic equation with coefficients given by the side lengths, simply find $k = b + 2013$, where $b$ is the length of side $CA$. Find the numbers of ordered array $(x_1,...,x_{100})$ that satisfies the following conditions: $(i)$ $x_1,...,x_{100} \\in \\{1,2,..,k\\}$; $(ii)$ $k | x_1 + \\dots + x_{100}$; $(iii)$ $k | x_1^2 + \\dots + x_{100}^2$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves a triangle $ABC$ inscribed in a circle of radius 2 with $\\\\angle ABC \\\\geq 90^\\\\circ$. Using the Law of Sines, the side $b = CA$ (opposite $\\\\angle B$) is given by $b = 4 \\\\sin B$. Since $\\\\angle B \\\\geq 90^\\\\circ$, $\\\\sin B \\\\leq 1$, so $b \\\\leq 4$. The maximum value of $b$ occurs when $\\\\angle B = 90^\\\\circ$, making $AC$ the diameter of the circle, hence $b = 4$.\\n\\nThe problem instructs to find $k = b + 2013$. With $b = 4$, we get $k = 4 + 2013 = 2017$. Note that 2017 is a prime number.\\n\\nNext, we count the number of ordered arrays $(x_1, \\\\dots, x_{100})$ where each $x_i \\\\in \\\\{1, 2, \\\\dots, k\\\\}$, satisfying:\\n- $k \\\\mid (x_1 + \\\\cdots + x_{100})$\\n- $k \\\\mid (x_1^2 + \\\\cdots + x_{100}^2)$\\n\\nFor a prime modulus $k$, the number of such arrays is $k^{n-2}$ for $n$ variables. Here, $n = 100$, so the count is $k^{98} = 2017^{98}$.\", \"answer\": \"2017^98\"}",
