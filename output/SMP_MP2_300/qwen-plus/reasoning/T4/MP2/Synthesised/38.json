  "math_problem": "Determine all polynomials $P(x)$ with real coefficients such that $P(x)^2 + P\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2=  P(x^2)P\\left(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)$ for all $x \\neq 0$. Instead of determining all polynomials with real coefficients satisfying the given functional equation, simply find $k = P(1) + 2003$, where $P(1)$ is the value of such a polynomial at $x=1$ derived from substituting $x=1$ into the functional equation. Can one find 4004 positive integers such that the sum of any $k$ of them is not divisible by 2003?",
