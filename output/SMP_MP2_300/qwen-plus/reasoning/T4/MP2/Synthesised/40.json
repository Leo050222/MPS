  "math_problem": "Determine all integers $ k\\ge 2$ such that for all pairs $ (m$, $ n)$ of different positive integers not greater than $ k$, the number $ n^{n-1}-m^{m-1}$ is not divisible by $ k$. Instead of determining all integers at least 2 such that no difference of the specified powered terms between distinct bases up to that integer is divisible by it, simply find $s = k - 1$, where $k$ is the smallest integer at least 2 for which at least one such difference between distinct bases up to $k$ is divisible by $k$. $2020$ positive integers are written in one line. Each of them starting with the $s$-th is divisible by previous and by the sum of two previous numbers. What is the smallest value the last number can take?\n\nA. Gribalko",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine the smallest integer $ k \\\\geq 2 $ such that there exist distinct positive integers $ m, n \\\\leq k $ with $ k \\\\mid (n^{n-1} - m^{m-1}) $. Checking small values:\\n- For $ k = 2 $: $ 2^1 - 1^0 = 1 $, not divisible by 2.\\n- For $ k = 3 $: All differences (e.g., $ 3^2 - 1^0 = 8 $, $ 3^2 - 2^1 = 7 $) are not divisible by 3.\\n- For $ k = 4 $: $ 3^{2} - 1^{0} = 9 - 1 = 8 $, which is divisible by 4. Thus, $ k = 4 $ is the smallest such integer.\\n\\nHence, $ s = k - 1 = 3 $.\\n\\nNext, consider a sequence of 2020 positive integers where each term starting from the $ s $-th (i.e., the 3rd term) must be divisible by the previous term and the sum of the two previous terms. To minimize the last term:\\n- Start with $ a_1 = 1 $, $ a_2 = 1 $ (smallest positive integers).\\n- $ a_3 $ must be divisible by $ a_2 = 1 $ and $ a_1 + a_2 = 2 $, so $ a_3 = 2 $.\\n- $ a_4 $ must be divisible by $ a_3 = 2 $ and $ a_2 + a_3 = 3 $, so $ a_4 = 6 $.\\n- $ a_5 $ must be divisible by $ a_4 = 6 $ and $ a_3 + a_4 = 8 $, so $ a_5 = 24 $.\\n- Continuing this pattern, each term $ a_n $ for $ n \\\\geq 3 $ equals $ (n-1)! $.\\n\\nBy induction, $ a_n = (n-1)! $ satisfies the divisibility conditions. For $ n = 2020 $, the last term is $ a_{2020} = 2019! $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2019!\"\n}",
