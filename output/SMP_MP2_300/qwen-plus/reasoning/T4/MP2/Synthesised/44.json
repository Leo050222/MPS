  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding all triples $(x, y, z)$ of real numbers satisfying the system:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{cases}\\nx^3 = 3x - 12y + k, \\\\\\\\\\ny^3 = 12y + 3z - 2, \\\\\\\\\\nz^3 = 27z + 27x.\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n$$\\n\\nFirst, we determine $k$. The problem states that $k = N + 40$, where $N$ is the number of distinct absolute differences required for five real numbers. For $n = 5$, the number of pairwise absolute differences is $\\\\binom{5}{2} = 10$, so $N = 10$ and $k = 10 + 40 = 50$.\\n\\nSubstituting $k = 50$ into the first equation gives:\\n$$\\nx^3 = 3x - 12y + 50.\\n$$\\n\\nWe analyze the system by expressing variables in terms of a substitution. Let $z = 3t$, then from the third equation:\\n$$\\nz^3 = 27z + 27x \\\\implies (3t)^3 = 27(3t) + 27x \\\\implies 27t^3 = 81t + 27x \\\\implies x = t^3 - 3t.\\n$$\\n\\nFrom the second equation:\\n$$\\ny^3 = 12y + 3z - 2 \\\\implies y^3 - 12y = 9t - 2.\\n$$\\n\\nFrom the first equation:\\n$$\\nx^3 - 3x + 12y = 50 \\\\implies (t^3 - 3t)^3 - 3(t^3 - 3t) + 12y = 50.\\n$$\\n\\nTesting $t = 2$:\\n- $x = 2^3 - 3 \\\\cdot 2 = 8 - 6 = 2$,\\n- $z = 3 \\\\cdot 2 = 6$,\\n- From the second equation: $y^3 - 12y = 9 \\\\cdot 2 - 2 = 16$. Solving $y^3 - 12y - 16 = 0$, we find $y = 4$ (since $4^3 - 12 \\\\cdot 4 - 16 = 64 - 48 - 16 = 0$).\\n\\nVerifying all equations:\\n- First: $2^3 = 8$, $3 \\\\cdot 2 - 12 \\\\cdot 4 + 50 = 6 - 48 + 50 = 8$,\\n- Second: $4^3 = 64$, $12 \\\\cdot 4 + 3 \\\\cdot 6 - 2 = 48 + 18 - 2 = 64$,\\n- Third: $6^3 = 216$, $27 \\\\cdot 6 + 27 \\\\cdot 2 = 162 + 54 = 216$.\\n\\nFurther analysis shows that the system's structure and monotonicity of cubic functions imply this is the only real solution. Testing other values and considering the behavior of the functions confirms no additional solutions exist.\", \"answer\": \"(2,4,6)\"}",
