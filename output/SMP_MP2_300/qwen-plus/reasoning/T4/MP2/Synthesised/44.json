Next, solve the system with k=50:\\n\\n1. $x^3 = 3x - 12y + 50$\\n2. $y^3 = 12y + 3z - 2$\\n3. $z^3 = 27z + 27x$\\n\\nAssume $z = 3t$, then equation 3 gives $x = t^3 - 3t$. Substituting $x=2$ (trial), equation 1 yields $y=4$. Checking equation 2 with $y=4$ gives $z=6$. Verify all equations:\\n- $2^3 = 8 = 3(2) - 12(4) + 50 = 6 - 48 + 50 = 8$\\n- $4^3 = 64 = 12(4) + 3(6) - 2 = 48 + 18 - 2 = 64$\\n- $6^3 = 216 = 27(6) + 27(2) = 162 + 54 = 216$\\n\\nTesting other values and analyzing monotonicity of cubic functions confirms this is the only real solution.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(2,4,6)\"\n}",
