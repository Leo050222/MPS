  "math_problem": "Find all positive integers $a$, $b$, $n$ and prime numbers $p$ that satisfy\n\\[\na^{2013} + b^{2013} = p^n.\n\\] Instead of identifying all tuples of positive integers and primes satisfying the given Diophantine equation, simply find $p$, the prime number that appears in the solutions. For each positive integer $k$ denote $C(k)$ to be sum of its distinct prime divisors. For example $C(1)=0,C(2)=2,C(45)=8$. Find all positive integers $n$ for which $C(p^n+1)=C(n)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve $a^{2013} + b^{2013} = p^n$ for prime $p$. Since 2013 is odd, factor as $(a + b)(\\\\text{other terms}) = p^n$. For coprime $a, b$, the factors must be powers of $p$, but they are coprime unless $a = b$. If $a = b$, then $2a^{2013} = p^n$, implying $p = 2$ (since 2 is prime). Other cases (e.g., $a \\\\neq b$) lead to multiple prime factors, violating the prime power condition. Thus, $p = 2$ is the only prime.\\n\\nNext, find $n$ such that $C(2^n + 1) = C(n)$, where $C(k)$ is the sum of distinct prime divisors of $k$. Testing small $n$:\\n- $n = 3$: $2^3 + 1 = 9 = 3^2$, so $C(9) = 3$; $C(3) = 3$. Equal.\\n- Other $n$ (e.g., $n = 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, \\\\dots$) yield mismatches. Using Mih\\u0103ilescu's theorem, $2^n + 1$ is a prime power only for specific $n$, but only $n = 3$ satisfies $C(2^n + 1) = C(n)$. Larger $n$ result in $C(2^n + 1)$ being much larger than $C(n)$ due to multiple prime factors.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
