  "math_problem": "A polynomial $P$ of degree 2015 satisfies the equation $P(n)=\\frac{1}{n^{2}}$ for $n=1,2, \\ldots, 2016$. Find $\\lfloor 2017 P(2017)\\rfloor$. Instead of finding the floor of the product of the next successive integer and the value of $P$ evaluated at that integer, simply find $d = Q(0) + 5$, where $Q(x) = x^{2} P(x) - 1$ is the auxiliary polynomial derived from the given interpolation condition. In the polynomial $x^{d} - 18x^{3} + kx^{2} + 200x - 1984 = 0$, the product of $2$ of its roots is $-32$. Find $k$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, define $ Q(x) = x^2 P(x) - 1 $. Since $ P(n) = \\\\frac{1}{n^2} $ for $ n = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, 2016 $, $ Q(n) = 0 $ for these values, making $ Q(x) $ a degree 2017 polynomial with roots at $ 1, 2, \\\\ldots, 2016 $. Evaluating $ Q(0) $ gives $ 0^2 P(0) - 1 = -1 $. Thus, $ d = Q(0) + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4 $.\\n\\nNext, consider the polynomial $ x^4 - 18x^3 + kx^2 + 200x - 1984 = 0 $ (since $ d = 4 $). Let the roots be $ r, s, t, u $. Given the product of two roots is $ -32 $, assume $ rs = -32 $. The product of all roots is $ rstu = -1984 $, so $ tu = \\\\frac{-1984}{-32} = 62 $. \\n\\nLet $ a = r + s $ and $ b = t + u $. Then $ a + b = 18 $ (sum of roots). The sum of products of roots three at a time is $ rs(b) + tu(a) = -32b + 62a = -200 $. Substituting $ b = 18 - a $:\\n$$\\n-32(18 - a) + 62a = -200 \\\\implies 94a = 376 \\\\implies a = 4, \\\\quad b = 14.\\n$$\\n\\nThe sum of products of roots two at a time is $ rs + tu + ab = -32 + 62 + (4)(14) = 86 $. Thus, $ k = 86 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"86\"\n}",
