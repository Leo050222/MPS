  "math_problem": "Find the number of triples of sets $(A, B, C)$ such that: (a) $A, B, C \\subseteq\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 8\\}$. (b) $|A \\cap B|=|B \\cap C|=|C \\cap A|=2$. (c) $|A|=|B|=|C|=4$. Here, $|S|$ denotes the number of elements in the set $S$. Instead of determining the total number of such triples of sets, simply find $m = |A \\cap B \\cap C|$, where $|A \\cap B \\cap C|$ is the size of the triple intersection derived from the structural consideration of configurations with no elements belonging to exactly two of the sets. Compute the number of ways there are to assemble $m$ red unit cubes and $25$ white unit cubes into a $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ cube such that red is visible on exactly 4 faces of the larger cube. (Rotations and reflections are considered distinct.)",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ m = |A \\\\cap B \\\\cap C| $ under the condition that no elements belong to exactly two sets. In such configurations, the pairwise intersections $ |A \\\\cap B|, |B \\\\cap C|, |C \\\\cap A| $ must equal the triple intersection $ |A \\\\cap B \\\\cap C| $ because there are no elements in exactly two sets. Given $ |A \\\\cap B| = |B \\\\cap C| = |C \\\\cap A| = 2 $, it follows that $ m = 2 $.\\n\\nNext, compute the number of ways to assemble 2 red and 25 white unit cubes into a $ 3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 3 $ cube such that red is visible on exactly 4 faces. A face is visible if at least one red cube lies on it. The 2 red cubes must be placed such that:\\n- Exactly 4 faces have at least one red cube.\\n- The remaining 2 faces have no red cubes.\\n\\nThere are two cases for the 2 invisible faces (T):\\n1. **T consists of opposite faces (3 such pairs)**: The complement (visible faces) forms a middle layer of 9 cubes. To cover all 4 visible faces with 2 red cubes, the only valid placements are the two diagonal pairs of edge centers in the middle layer, giving 2 placements per pair. Total: $ 3 \\\\times 2 = 6 $.\\n2. **T consists of adjacent faces (12 such pairs)**: The complement has 12 cubes. Valid placements include combinations of corners, edge centers, and face centers that cover all 4 visible faces. Detailed analysis shows 9 valid placements per pair. Total: $ 12 \\\\times 9 = 108 $.\\n\\nSumming both cases: $ 6 + 108 = 114 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"114\"\n}",
