There exists a polynomial $P$ of degree 5 with the following property: if $z$ is a complex number such that $z^{5}+2004 z=1$, then $P(z^{2})=0$. Calculate the quotient $P(d) / P(-d)$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first determine $ d = a - 14 $, where $ a $ is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that there exists a positive integer $ b $ satisfying $ 4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1 $. This equation can be rewritten as $ (2b)^2 - 3a^2 = 1 $, which is a Pell equation of the form $ x^2 - 3y^2 = 1 $ with $ x = 2b $ and $ y = a $. The minimal solution to this Pell equation is $ (x, y) = (2, 1) $, but since $ a > 1 $, we consider subsequent solutions generated by $ (2 + \\\\sqrt{3})^k $. The next valid solution where $ x $ is even (so $ b $ is an integer) occurs at $ k = 3 $, giving $ x = 26 $, $ y = 15 $. Thus, $ a = 15 $, so $ d = 15 - 14 = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, we analyze the polynomial $ P(w) $ of degree 5 such that if $ z $ satisfies $ z^5 + 2004z = 1 $, then $ P(z^2) = 0 $. Let $ w = z^2 $. From the given equation, $ z^5 = 1 - 2004z $, and substituting $ z^5 = w^2 z $, we derive $ w(w^2 + 2004)^2 = 1 $, leading to the polynomial $ P(w) = w^5 + 4008w^3 + 2004^2 w - 1 $.\\n\\nWe compute $ P(1) $ and $ P(-1) $:\\n- $ P(1) = 1^5 + 4008 \\\\cdot 1^3 + 2004^2 \\\\cdot 1 - 1 = 4008 + 2004^2 = 2004 \\\\cdot 2006 = 2005^2 - 1 $\\n- $ P(-1) = (-1)^5 + 4008 \\\\cdot (-1)^3 + 2004^2 \\\\cdot (-1) - 1 = - (2005^2 + 1) $\\n\\nThe quotient $ \\\\frac{P(d)}{P(-d)} = \\\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \\\\frac{2005^2 - 1}{- (2005^2 + 1)} = -\\\\frac{2005^2 - 1}{2005^2 + 1} $.
