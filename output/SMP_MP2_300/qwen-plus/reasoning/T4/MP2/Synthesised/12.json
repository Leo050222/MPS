  "math_problem": "Find all positive integers $n, k_1, \\dots, k_n$ such that $k_1 + \\cdots + k_n = 5n-4$ and \\[ \\frac{1}{k_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{k_n} = 1. \\] Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ and corresponding $k_1, \\dots, k_n$ satisfying the sum and reciprocal sum conditions, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the part size in the solution with the smallest possible $n$, derived from the structural consideration of minimal number of terms in the representation. Alice and Bob play a game on a board consisting of one row of $k + 2021$ consecutive squares. They take turns placing tiles that cover two adjacent squares, with Alice going first. By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule. Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends; Bob's goal is to minimize it. What is the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure at the end of the game, no matter how Bob plays?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first analyze the mathematical condition involving positive integers $ n, k_1, \\\\dots, k_n $ such that:\\n\\n$$\\nk_1 + \\\\cdots + k_n = 5n - 4 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{k_n} = 1.\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine the Smallest Valid $ n $\\n\\nWe apply the **AM-HM inequality** to find constraints on $ n $:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{k_1 + \\\\cdots + k_n}{n} \\\\geq \\\\frac{n}{\\\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{k_n}} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{5n - 4}{n} \\\\geq n \\\\Rightarrow 5 - \\\\frac{4}{n} \\\\geq n \\\\Rightarrow n^2 - 5n + 4 \\\\leq 0.\\n$$\\n\\nSolving the quadratic inequality:\\n\\n$$\\n(n - 1)(n - 4) \\\\leq 0 \\\\Rightarrow n \\\\in [1, 4].\\n$$\\n\\nSo possible values of $ n $ are $ 1, 2, 3, 4 $. We now check which of these yield valid solutions.\\n\\n- **$ n = 1 $:**  \\n  $ k_1 = 5(1) - 4 = 1 $, and $ \\\\frac{1}{k_1} = 1 $. ✅ Valid.\\n\\n- **$ n = 2 $:**  \\n  $ k_1 + k_2 = 6 $, $ \\\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\\\frac{1}{k_2} = 1 $. Solving gives no integer solutions. ❌\\n\\n- **$ n = 3 $:**  \\n  $ k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 11 $, $ \\\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\\\frac{1}{k_2} + \\\\frac{1}{k_3} = 1 $. A solution is $ (2, 3, 6) $. ✅\\n\\n- **$ n = 4 $:**  \\n  $ k_1 + \\\\cdots + k_4 = 16 $, $ \\\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{k_4} = 1 $. A solution is $ (4, 4, 4, 4) $. ✅\\n\\nThus, all $ n = 1, 3, 4 $ are valid. However, the problem specifies:\\n\\n> \\\"k is the part size in the solution with the smallest possible $ n $, derived from the structural consideration of minimal number of terms in the representation.\\\"\\n\\nThis suggests a **non-trivial** solution where the parts are **equal**, as this reflects a more structured or homogeneous representation. The only such solution with equal parts is for $ n = 4 $, where all $ k_i = 4 $.\\n\\nHence, the intended value is:\\n\\n$$\\nk = 4\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Analyze the Game on the Board\\n\\nThe board has $ k + 2021 = 4 + 2021 = 2025 $ squares.\\n\\nAlice and Bob alternately place dominoes covering two adjacent squares. Alice aims to **maximize** the number of uncovered squares, while Bob aims to **minimize** it.\\n\\nLet’s define:\\n\\n- $ m = 2025 $: total number of squares.\\n- Since $ m $ is **odd**, the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed is $ \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{m}{2} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 1012 $, leaving **at least one square uncovered**.\\n\\nFrom known results in combinatorial game theory for this type of tiling game:\\n\\n- If $ m $ is **odd**, then **Bob can always force exactly one square to remain uncovered**, regardless of Alice's strategy.\\n- If $ m $ is **even and $ \\\\geq 4 $**, Alice can ensure **two squares remain uncovered**.\\n\\nSince $ m = 2025 $ is odd, the **maximum number of uncovered squares Alice can guarantee** is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\boxed{1}\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"1\"}",
