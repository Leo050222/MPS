  "math_problem": "Find all positive integers $n, k_1, \\dots, k_n$ such that $k_1 + \\cdots + k_n = 5n-4$ and \\[ \\frac{1}{k_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{k_n} = 1. \\] Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ and corresponding $k_1, \\dots, k_n$ satisfying the sum and reciprocal sum conditions, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the part size in the solution with the smallest possible $n$, derived from the structural consideration of minimal number of terms in the representation. Alice and Bob play a game on a board consisting of one row of $k + 2021$ consecutive squares. They take turns placing tiles that cover two adjacent squares, with Alice going first. By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule. Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends; Bob's goal is to minimize it. What is the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure at the end of the game, no matter how Bob plays?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the first part: finding all positive integers $ n, k_1, \\\\dots, k_n $ such that:\\n\\n$$\\nk_1 + \\\\cdots + k_n = 5n - 4 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{k_n} = 1.\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Use AM-HM Inequality\\n\\nLet’s apply the **Arithmetic Mean - Harmonic Mean (AM-HM) inequality** to the sequence $ k_1, \\\\dots, k_n $:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{k_1 + \\\\cdots + k_n}{n} \\\\geq \\\\frac{n}{\\\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{k_n}}.\\n$$\\n\\nGiven:\\n- $ \\\\sum k_i = 5n - 4 $\\n- $ \\\\sum \\\\frac{1}{k_i} = 1 $\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{5n - 4}{n} \\\\geq n \\\\Rightarrow 5 - \\\\frac{4}{n} \\\\geq n \\\\Rightarrow n^2 - 5n + 4 \\\\leq 0 \\\\Rightarrow (n - 1)(n - 4) \\\\leq 0.\\n$$\\n\\nThis implies $ n \\\\in [1, 4] $. So possible values for $ n $ are $ 1, 2, 3, 4 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Check Each Valid $ n $\\n\\n#### Case $ n = 1 $:\\n\\n- $ k_1 = 5(1) - 4 = 1 $\\n- $ \\\\frac{1}{k_1} = 1 $\\n\\n✅ Valid solution. The only part size is $ k = 1 $.\\n\\n#### Case $ n = 2 $:\\n\\n- $ k_1 + k_2 = 6 $\\n- $ \\\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\\\frac{1}{k_2} = 1 $\\n\\nSolving gives non-integer solutions (e.g., roots of $ x^2 - 6x + 6 = 0 $), so ❌ no valid integer solution.\\n\\n#### Case $ n = 3 $:\\n\\n- $ k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 11 $\\n- $ \\\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\\\frac{1}{k_2} + \\\\frac{1}{k_3} = 1 $\\n\\nOne valid solution is $ [2, 3, 6] $, since:\\n- $ 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 $\\n- $ \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{6} = 1 $\\n\\n✅ Valid solution, but not all parts equal.\\n\\n#### Case $ n = 4 $:\\n\\n- $ k_1 + \\\\cdots + k_4 = 16 $\\n- $ \\\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{k_4} = 1 $\\n\\nA valid solution is $ [4, 4, 4, 4] $, since:\\n- $ 4 \\\\times 4 = 16 $\\n- $ 4 \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{4} = 1 $\\n\\n✅ Valid solution with all parts equal.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Determine the Smallest $ n $ with Equal Parts\\n\\nThe problem asks for **the part size $ k $ in the solution with the smallest possible $ n $**, derived from the structural consideration of minimal number of terms.\\n\\n- For $ n = 1 $: $ k = 1 $, and it's a valid solution with all parts equal.\\n- For $ n = 4 $: $ k = 4 $, also valid with all parts equal.\\n\\nSince $ n = 1 < 4 $, the **smallest possible $ n $** is $ 1 $, and the corresponding **part size** is:\\n\\n$$\\nk = 1\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Game Analysis\\n\\nAlice and Bob play on a board of length $ N = k + 2021 = 1 + 2021 = 2022 $.\\n\\nThey take turns placing dominoes (covering two adjacent squares). Alice wants to **maximize** the number of **uncovered squares**, while Bob wants to **minimize** it.\\n\\nThis is a classic combinatorial game where the goal is to determine the **maximum number of uncovered squares Alice can ensure regardless of Bob's play**.\\n\\nFrom analysis of similar games:\\n\\n- If $ N $ is even and $ N \\\\geq 4 $, then Alice can always force **exactly 2 uncovered squares**.\\n- This is achieved by splitting the board into two segments of odd lengths (e.g., placing a domino in the middle), which ensures that both segments end up with 1 uncovered square each.\\n\\nFor $ N = 2022 $, which is even and $ \\\\geq 4 $, the **maximum number of uncovered squares Alice can ensure** is:\\n\\n$$\\n2\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"2\"}",
