  "math_problem": "Find all positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that $\\frac{a^{2}+b}{b^{2}-a}$ and $\\frac{b^{2}+a}{a^{2}-b}$ are both integers. Instead of determining all such pairs of positive integers, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the value of $\\frac{a^{2}+b}{b^{2}-a}$ for solution pairs $(a, b)$ that are consecutive positive integers. Let $P(n)=\\left(n-1^{3}\\right)\\left(n-2^{3}\\right) \\ldots\\left(n-40^{3}\\right)$ for positive integers $n$. Suppose that $d$ is the largest positive integer that divides $P(n)$ for every integer $n>(k + 2022)$. If $d$ is a product of $m$ (not necessarily distinct) prime numbers, compute $m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first identify all consecutive positive integer pairs $(a, b)$ such that both $\\\\frac{a^2 + b}{b^2 - a}$ and $\\\\frac{b^2 + a}{a^2 - b}$ are integers. The only valid pairs with both fractions being **positive integers** are $(2, 3)$ and $(3, 2)$. For $(2, 3)$, $\\\\frac{a^2 + b}{b^2 - a} = \\\\frac{4 + 3}{9 - 2} = 1$, and for $(3, 2)$, it equals $\\\\frac{9 + 2}{4 - 3} = 11$. Since the problem specifies \\\"the value\\\" of this expression for such pairs, and the non-trivial value (not 1) is 11, we conclude $k = 11$.\\n\\nNext, define $P(n) = \\\\prod_{m=1}^{40} (n - m^3)$. We are to find the largest integer $d$ that divides $P(n)$ for all $n > k + 2022 = 2033$, and then determine $m$, the total number of prime factors (counted with multiplicity) of $d$.\\n\\nThe key insight is that $d$ is the product of primes $p$ for which the cube map modulo $p$ is surjective (i.e., every residue mod $p$ is a cube), raised to the minimum number of times $p$ divides $P(n)$ over all $n$. These primes are:\\n- $p = 2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 23, 29$ (all primes $\\\\leq 40$ where $\\\\gcd(3, p-1) = 1$ or $p = 2, 3$).\\n\\nFor each such prime $p$, the exponent in $d$ is the minimum count of $m \\\\in [1, 40]$ such that $m^3 \\\\equiv r \\\\mod p$ for any residue $r$. This gives:\\n- $2^{20}$, $3^{13}$, $5^8$, $11^3$, $17^2$, $23^1$, $29^1$.\\n\\nSumming the exponents: $20 + 13 + 8 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 48$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"48\"\n}",
