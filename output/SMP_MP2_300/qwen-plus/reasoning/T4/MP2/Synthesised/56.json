Find all integers $n\\\\geq 2$ for which \\\\[P(n)+\\\\lfloor\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\rfloor=P(n+1)+\\\\lfloor\\\\sqrt{n+1}\\\\rfloor\\\\] Instead of finding all integers $n\\\\geq 2$ for which $P(n)+\\\\lfloor\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\rfloor=P(n+1)+\\\\lfloor\\\\sqrt{n+1}\\\\rfloor$, simply find $k = p + 11$, where $p$ is the greatest prime divisor of the integer $n$ that satisfies the condition. Determine all quadruples $(x,y,z,t)$ of positive integers such that\n\\\\[ 20^x + k^{2y} = (x + 2y + z)^{zt}.\\\\]",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the equation $P(n) + \\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\rfloor = P(n+1) + \\\\lfloor \\\\sqrt{n+1} \\\\rfloor$. Analyzing cases where $n+1$ is a perfect square (Case 2) and not (Case 1), we find that only $n=3$ satisfies the condition. For $n=3$, $P(3)=3$, so $k = 3 + 11 = 14$. Next, solve $20^x + 14^{2y} = (x + 2y + z)^{zt}$ for positive integers $x, y, z, t$. Testing small values, the only solution is $x=1$, $y=1$, $z=3$, $t=1$, as $20^1 + 14^{2\\\\cdot1} = 216 = 6^3 = (1 + 2\\\\cdot1 + 3)^{3\\\\cdot1}$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(1,1,3,1)\"\n}",
