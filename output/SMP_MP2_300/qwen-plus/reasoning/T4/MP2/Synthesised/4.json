  "math_problem": "Determine the form of $n$ such that $2^n + 2$ is divisible by $n$ where $n$ is less than 100. Instead of determining the possible values of $n$ less than 100 for which $n$ divides $2^n + 2$, simply find $n$, where $n$ is the largest positive integer less than 100 satisfying this divisibility condition. Determine all pairs $(h, s)$ of positive integers with the following property: If one draws $h$ horizontal lines and another $s$ lines which satisfy (i) they are not horizontal, (ii) no two of them are parallel, (iii) no three of the $h+s$ lines are concurrent, then the number of regions formed by these $h+s$ lines is $n + 1926$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find the largest n < 100 such that n divides 2^n + 2. Testing values, n=66 works: 2^66 + 2 is divisible by 66 (mod 6 and mod 11 both yield 0). No larger n < 100 satisfies the condition. Next, the number of regions formed by h horizontal and s non-horizontal lines (with given constraints) is given by the formula [(s+1)(2h + s) + 2]/2. Setting this equal to n + 1926 = 66 + 1926 = 1992, we solve (s+1)(2h + s) = 3982. Factoring 3982 = 2 × 11 × 181, valid (a,b) pairs (where a = s+1, b = 2h + s) are (2,1991), (11,362), (22,181), yielding (h,s) = (995,1), (176,10), (80,21).\",\n    \"answer\": \"(80,21), (176,10), (995,1)\"\n}",
