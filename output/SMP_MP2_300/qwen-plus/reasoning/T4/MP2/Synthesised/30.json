  "math_problem": "In a sports meeting a total of $m$ medals were awarded over $n$ days. On the first day one medal and $\\frac{1}{7}$ of the remaining medals were awarded. On the second day two medals and $\\frac{1}{7}$ of the remaining medals were awarded, and so on. On the last day, the remaining $n$ medals were awarded. How many medals did the meeting last, and what was the total number of medals ? Instead of determining the total number of medals and the number of days the meeting lasted, simply find $k = c - 35$, where $c$ is the constant term in the linear particular solution derived from the sequential awarding process for the remaining medals. Do there exist $\\{x,y\\}\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying $(2x+k)^{3}+k=y^{4}$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves determining $ k = c - 35 $, where $ c $ is the constant term in the linear particular solution of the recurrence relation modeling the medal distribution. The recurrence for remaining medals before day $ k $ is $ M_{k+1} = \\\\frac{6}{7}(M_k - k) $. Solving this linear recurrence, the particular solution is found to be $ M_k^p = -6k + 42 $, giving $ c = 42 $. Thus, $ k = 42 - 35 = 7 $. Next, we check if there exist integers $ x, y $ satisfying $ (2x + 7)^3 + 7 = y^4 $. Testing small values and analyzing modulo constraints (e.g., modulo 16 and 9) shows no integer solutions exist for this equation. Therefore, no such integers $ \\\\{x, y\\\\} $ satisfy the equation.\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\"\n}",
