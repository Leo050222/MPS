  "math_problem": "Let $(F_n)$ be the sequence defined recursively by $F_1=F_2=1$ and $F_{n+1}=F_n+F_{n-1}$ for $n\\\\geq 2$. Find all pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ such that\n$$5F_x-3F_y=1.$$ Instead of determining all pairs of positive integers whose corresponding terms in the sequence satisfy the given linear relation equaling one, simply find $k = F_8 - 19$, where $F_8$ denotes the eighth term of the sequence. Find all functions $f:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the equation \\\\[|x|f(y)+yf(x)=f(xy)+f(x^k)+f(f(y))\\\\] for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute the eighth Fibonacci number. The sequence starts with F₁=1, F₂=1, so F₃=2, F₄=3, F₅=5, F₆=8, F₇=13, F₈=21. Thus, k = F₈ - 19 = 21 - 19 = 2. The functional equation becomes |x|f(y) + yf(x) = f(xy) + f(x²) + f(f(y)) for all real x, y.\\n\\nTesting constant functions: f(x) = 0 satisfies the equation. For linear functions f(x) = ax + b, only the zero function works. \\n\\nSetting x = 0 gives yf(0) = 2f(0) + f(f(y)), implying f(f(y)) = cf(0)y - 2f(0). If f(0) = 0, then f(f(y)) = 0 for all y. Setting y = 0 shows f(x²) = 0 for all x, so f(z) = 0 for z ≥ 0.\\n\\nFor x > 0 and y < 0, the equation reduces to x f(y) = f(xy). This implies f is linear on negative reals: f(z) = cz for z < 0. Ensuring f(f(y)) = 0 requires c ≤ 0 (since f(y) ≥ 0 for y < 0 when c ≤ 0, making f(f(y)) = 0). Thus, all solutions are f(x) = 0 for x ≥ 0 and f(x) = cx for x < 0 with c ≤ 0.\",\n    \"answer\": \"f(x) = 0 for all x ≥ 0 and f(x) = cx for all x < 0 where c is a non-positive real constant\"\n}",
