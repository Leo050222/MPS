  "math_problem": "Let $(F_n)$ be the sequence defined recursively by $F_1=F_2=1$ and $F_{n+1}=F_n+F_{n-1}$ for $n\\\\geq 2$. Find all pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ such that\n$$5F_x-3F_y=1.$$ Instead of determining all pairs of positive integers whose corresponding terms in the sequence satisfy the given linear relation equaling one, simply find $k = F_8 - 19$, where $F_8$ denotes the eighth term of the sequence. Find all functions $f:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the equation \\\\[|x|f(y)+yf(x)=f(xy)+f(x^k)+f(f(y))\\\\] for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute the 8th Fibonacci number. The sequence starts F₁=1, F₂=1, F₃=2, F₄=3, F₅=5, F₆=8, F₇=13, F₈=21. Thus, k = F₈ - 19 = 21 - 19 = 2. The functional equation becomes |x|f(y) + yf(x) = f(xy) + f(x²) + f(f(y)). Testing constant functions, f(x)=0 satisfies the equation. For non-zero functions, setting x=0 gives f(f(y)) = c(y - 2) where c=f(0). If c≠0, contradictions arise when comparing coefficients, forcing c=0. Further analysis shows f must be zero everywhere to satisfy all cases. Verification confirms f(x)=0 is the only solution.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
