  "math_problem": "Determine all composite positive integers $n$ for which it is possible to arrange all divisors of $n$ that are greater than 1 in a circle so that no two adjacent divisors are relatively prime. Instead of determining all composite positive integers $n$ for which such a circular arrangement exists, simply find $k = \\gcd(p, q) + 1$, where $p$ and $q$ are the distinct prime factors of $n$ in the case where the set of divisors of $n$ greater than 1 has exactly three elements. Let $\\mathbb{N}$ denote the set of positive integers. Find all functions $f : \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that for positive integers $a$ and $b,$ \n\\[f(a^k + b^k) = f(a)f(b) \\text{ and } f(a^k) = f(a)^2.\\]",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we first identify composite numbers $ n $ where the set of divisors greater than 1 has exactly three elements. The total number of positive divisors of $ n $, denoted $ d(n) $, must satisfy $ d(n) - 1 = 3 $, so $ d(n) = 4 $. Numbers with exactly 4 divisors are either $ p^3 $ (where $ p $ is prime) or $ pq $ (where $ p $ and $ q $ are distinct primes). However, the problem specifies $ p $ and $ q $ as *distinct* prime factors of $ n $, which excludes $ p^3 $ (only one prime factor). Thus, $ n = pq $, with divisors greater than 1 being $ p, q, pq $. Since $ p $ and $ q $ are distinct primes, $ \\\\gcd(p, q) = 1 $. Therefore, $ k = \\\\gcd(p, q) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2\"\n}",
