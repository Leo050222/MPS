  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the polynomial interpolation condition and determining $ q_{\\\\text{val}} $.\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine $ q_{\\\\text{val}} $\\n\\nWe are given that $ P(x) $ is a degree-$ n $ polynomial such that:\\n$$\\nP(k) = \\\\frac{k}{k+1}, \\\\quad \\\\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots, n.\\n$$\\nDefine:\\n$$\\nQ(x) = (x + 1)P(x) - x.\\n$$\\nThen for each $ k = 0, 1, \\\\ldots, n $, we have:\\n$$\\nQ(k) = (k + 1)P(k) - k = (k + 1)\\\\cdot\\\\frac{k}{k+1} - k = k - k = 0.\\n$$\\nThus, $ Q(x) $ has roots at $ x = 0, 1, \\\\ldots, n $, so it can be written as:\\n$$\\nQ(x) = c \\\\cdot x(x - 1)(x - 2)\\\\cdots(x - n),\\n$$\\nfor some constant $ c $. Since $ Q(x) $ is of degree $ n+1 $, this form is consistent.\\n\\nNow evaluate $ Q(-1) $:\\n$$\\nQ(-1) = (-1 + 1)P(-1) - (-1) = 0 \\\\cdot P(-1) + 1 = 1.\\n$$\\nOn the other hand, using the factored form:\\n$$\\nQ(-1) = c \\\\cdot (-1)(-2)(-3)\\\\cdots(-(n+1)) = c \\\\cdot (-1)^{n+1}(n+1)!.\\n$$\\nEquating both expressions:\\n$$\\n1 = c \\\\cdot (-1)^{n+1}(n+1)! \\\\Rightarrow c = \\\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}.\\n$$\\nHowever, the value of $ q_{\\\\text{val}} $ is defined as $ Q(-1) $, which we already computed directly as:\\n$$\\nq_{\\\\text{val}} = Q(-1) = 1.\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 2: Analyze the Good Sequence\\n\\nWe are told that $ a_k = q_{\\\\text{val}} + 2013 = 1 + 2013 = 2014 $, and we need to find the **smallest positive integer $ n $** such that there exists a good sequence $ a_0, a_1, \\\\ldots, a_n $ with $ a_n = 2014 $.\\n\\nThe sequence satisfies:\\n- $ a_0 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ $,\\n- For all $ i \\\\geq 0 $, $ a_{i+1} = 2a_i + 1 $ or $ a_{i+1} = \\\\frac{a_i}{a_i + 2} $.\\n\\nLet’s define a transformation to simplify the recurrence. Let:\\n$$\\nb_i = \\\\frac{1}{a_i + 1}.\\n$$\\nThen:\\n- If $ a_{i+1} = 2a_i + 1 $, then:\\n  $$\\n  b_{i+1} = \\\\frac{1}{(2a_i + 1) + 1} = \\\\frac{1}{2(a_i + 1)} = \\\\frac{1}{2}b_i.\\n  $$\\n- If $ a_{i+1} = \\\\frac{a_i}{a_i + 2} $, then:\\n  $$\\n  b_{i+1} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{a_i}{a_i + 2} + 1} = \\\\frac{a_i + 2}{2a_i + 2} = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2}b_i = \\\\frac{1 + b_i}{2}.\\n  $$\\n\\nSo the recurrence becomes:\\n$$\\nb_{i+1} = \\\\frac{1}{2}b_i \\\\quad \\\\text{or} \\\\quad b_{i+1} = \\\\frac{1 + b_i}{2}.\\n$$\\nThis is equivalent to binary expansions in the interval $ (0,1) $, where each bit corresponds to which operation was used.\\n\\nWe want to reach $ a_n = 2014 $, so:\\n$$\\nb_n = \\\\frac{1}{2015}.\\n$$\\nWe now reverse the process from $ b_n = \\\\frac{1}{2015} $ to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ b_0 = \\\\frac{1}{m} $ for some integer $ m \\\\geq 2 $.\\n\\nIn reverse, the operations become:\\n- $ b_i = 2b_{i+1} $ (if the forward step was $ b_{i+1} = \\\\frac{1}{2}b_i $),\\n- $ b_i = 2b_{i+1} - 1 $ (if the forward step was $ b_{i+1} = \\\\frac{1 + b_i}{2} $).\\n\\nWe seek the minimal $ n $ such that after $ n $ reverse steps starting from $ \\\\frac{1}{2015} $, we obtain a value of the form $ \\\\frac{1}{m} $ for some integer $ m \\\\geq 2 $.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to finding the **multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2015**, because the condition for reaching $ \\\\frac{1}{m} $ leads to:\\n$$\\n2^n \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{2015}.\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 3: Compute the Order of 2 Modulo 2015\\n\\nFactorize 2015:\\n$$\\n2015 = 5 \\\\times 13 \\\\times 31.\\n$$\\nCompute the order of 2 modulo each prime factor:\\n- Modulo 5: $ 2^4 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{5} $, so order is 4.\\n- Modulo 13: $ 2^{12} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{13} $, and no smaller exponent works, so order is 12.\\n- Modulo 31: $ 2^5 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{31} $, so order is 5.\\n\\nThe order modulo 2015 is the least common multiple of these:\\n$$\\n\\\\text{lcm}(4, 12, 5) = 60.\\n$$\\n\\nThus, the smallest $ n $ such that $ 2^n \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{2015} $ is $ \\\\boxed{60} $.\\n\\nThis means that the minimal number of steps required to construct a good sequence ending at $ a_n = 2014 $ is **60**.\", \"answer\": \"60\"}",
