Instead of determining the extrapolated value of the interpolating polynomial at the next successive integer, simply find $q_val$, where $q_val$ is the value at $x=-1$ of the expression $(x+1)P(x) - x$ with $P(x)$ the polynomial satisfying the given interpolation conditions.

  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the polynomial interpolation condition and computing $ q_{\\\\text{val}} $, which is defined as the value of the expression $ (x + 1)P(x) - x $ evaluated at $ x = -1 $, where $ P(x) $ is a degree-$ n $ polynomial satisfying $ P(k) = \\\\frac{k}{k+1} $ for $ k = 0, 1, \\\\dots, n $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine $ q_{\\\\text{val}} $\\n\\nLet $ Q(x) = (x + 1)P(x) - x $. Then:\\n\\n- For each $ k = 0, 1, \\\\dots, n $, we have:\\n  $$\\n  Q(k) = (k + 1)P(k) - k = (k + 1)\\\\cdot\\\\frac{k}{k + 1} - k = k - k = 0\\n  $$\\n  So $ Q(x) $ has roots at $ x = 0, 1, \\\\dots, n $.\\n\\n- Since $ P(x) $ is a degree-$ n $ polynomial, $ (x + 1)P(x) $ is a degree-$ n+1 $ polynomial, so $ Q(x) $ is also a degree-$ n+1 $ polynomial.\\n\\n- Therefore, $ Q(x) = c \\\\cdot x(x - 1)(x - 2)\\\\cdots(x - n) $ for some constant $ c $.\\n\\nNow evaluate $ Q(-1) $:\\n$$\\nQ(-1) = (-1 + 1)P(-1) - (-1) = 0 \\\\cdot P(-1) + 1 = 1\\n$$\\nThus, $ q_{\\\\text{val}} = Q(-1) = 1 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Interpret the Sequence Condition\\n\\nWe are told that a sequence $ a_0, a_1, \\\\dots $ is **good** if:\\n\\n1. $ a_0 $ is a positive integer.\\n2. Each term satisfies either:\\n   - $ a_{i+1} = 2a_i + 1 $, or\\n   - $ a_{i+1} = \\\\frac{a_i}{a_i + 2} $\\n3. There exists a **positive integer** $ k $ such that $ a_k = q_{\\\\text{val}} + 2013 = 1 + 2013 = 2014 $\\n\\nWe are to find the **smallest positive integer $ n $** such that there exists a good sequence with $ a_n = 2014 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Transform the Problem Using a Key Insight\\n\\nDefine $ d_i = a_i + 1 $. Then:\\n\\n- If $ a_{i+1} = 2a_i + 1 $, then:\\n  $$\\n  d_{i+1} = a_{i+1} + 1 = 2a_i + 2 = 2(a_i + 1) = 2d_i\\n  $$\\n\\n- If $ a_{i+1} = \\\\frac{a_i}{a_i + 2} $, then:\\n  $$\\n  d_{i+1} = a_{i+1} + 1 = \\\\frac{a_i}{a_i + 2} + 1 = \\\\frac{2a_i + 2}{a_i + 2} = \\\\frac{2d_i}{d_i + 1}\\n  $$\\n\\nSo the transformation simplifies the recurrence relations into:\\n\\n- $ d_{i+1} = 2d_i $ (operation A)\\n- $ d_{i+1} = \\\\frac{2d_i}{d_i + 1} $ (operation B)\\n\\nOur goal becomes finding the smallest $ n $ such that $ d_n = 2015 $, starting from some $ d_0 \\\\geq 2 $ (since $ a_0 \\\\geq 1 \\\\Rightarrow d_0 = a_0 + 1 \\\\geq 2 $).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Work Backwards from $ d_n = 2015 $\\n\\nWe reverse the operations to find the minimal number of steps needed to reach an integer $ d_0 \\\\geq 2 $.\\n\\n- If $ d_k = 2d_{k+1} $, then $ d_{k+1} = \\\\frac{d_k}{2} $\\n- If $ d_k = \\\\frac{2d_{k+1}}{d_{k+1} + 1} $, then solving gives:\\n  $$\\n  d_{k+1} = \\\\frac{d_k}{2 - d_k}\\n  $$\\n\\nStarting from $ d_0 = 2015 $, we apply these backward steps until we reach an integer $ d_n \\\\geq 2 $.\\n\\nThrough careful computation (as detailed in the thought process), it turns out that the **first time** we reach an integer $ d_n $ is after **60 backward steps**, corresponding to **60 forward steps** in the original sequence.\\n\\nThis means the **smallest positive integer $ n $** such that $ a_n = 2014 $ is:\\n\\n$$\\nn = 60\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"60\"}",
