  "math_problem": "Find all functions $ f : \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} $ such that\n\\[ f( x f(x) + 2y ) = f(x^2) + f(y) + x + y - 1 \\]\nholds for all $ x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Instead of identifying all functions from the reals to the reals satisfying the given identity for all real inputs, simply find $k = a + 8$, where $a$ is the coefficient of the input variable in the unique affine solution derived from substituting the assumed linear form into the relation $f(2y) = f(y) + y$ obtained by analyzing the functional equation at specific points. Sir Alex plays the following game on a row of $k$ cells. Initially, all cells are empty. In each move, Sir Alex is allowed to perform exactly one of the following two operations:\n1. Choose any number of the form $2^j$, where $j$ is a non-negative integer, and put it into an empty cell.\n2. Choose two (not necessarily adjacent) cells with the same number in them; denote that number by $2^j$. Replace the number in one of the cells with $2^{j+1}$ and erase the number in the other cell.\n\nAt the end of the game, one cell contains $2^n$, where $n$ is a given positive integer, while the other cells are empty. Determine the maximum number of moves that Sir Alex could have made, in terms of $n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the functional equation $ f(x f(x) + 2y) = f(x^2) + f(y) + x + y - 1 $. Assume $ f $ is affine: $ f(x) = mx + b $. Substituting into the equation and equating coefficients gives $ m = 1 $ and $ b = 1 $, so $ f(x) = x + 1 $. Analyzing at $ x = 0 $ yields $ f(2y) = f(y) + y $, which for the affine solution confirms $ m = 1 $. Thus, $ a = 1 $, so $ k = a + 8 = 9 $.\\n\\nNext, consider the game on $ k = 9 $ cells. To maximize moves, all type 1 moves must add $ 2^0 = 1 $ (maximizing $ M_1 $). The total mass (sum of all numbers) must equal $ 2^n $, requiring $ M_1 = 2^n $ type 1 moves. Each type 2 move combines two equal numbers, reducing cell count by 1. Starting from 0 cells and ending at 1 cell, $ M_1 - M_2 = 1 \\\\implies M_2 = M_1 - 1 $. Total moves: $ M = M_1 + M_2 = 2^{n+1} - 1 $. With $ k = 9 \\\\geq 2 $, the cell constraint is always satisfied by interleaving additions and combinations, confirming the maximum moves.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2^{n+1} - 1\"\n}",
