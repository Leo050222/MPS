  "math_problem": "Find all functions $ f : \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} $ such that\n\\[ f( x f(x) + 2y ) = f(x^2) + f(y) + x + y - 1 \\]\nholds for all $ x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Instead of identifying all functions from the reals to the reals satisfying the given identity for all real inputs, simply find $k = a + 8$, where $a$ is the coefficient of the input variable in the unique affine solution derived from substituting the assumed linear form into the relation $f(2y) = f(y) + y$ obtained by analyzing the functional equation at specific points. Sir Alex plays the following game on a row of $k$ cells. Initially, all cells are empty. In each move, Sir Alex is allowed to perform exactly one of the following two operations:\n1. Choose any number of the form $2^j$, where $j$ is a non-negative integer, and put it into an empty cell.\n2. Choose two (not necessarily adjacent) cells with the same number in them; denote that number by $2^j$. Replace the number in one of the cells with $2^{j+1}$ and erase the number in the other cell.\n\nAt the end of the game, one cell contains $2^n$, where $n$ is a given positive integer, while the other cells are empty. Determine the maximum number of moves that Sir Alex could have made, in terms of $n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the functional equation to find $k$. Assume $f$ is affine: $f(t) = mt + b$. Substitute into the equation:\\n\\n- LHS: $f(x f(x) + 2y) = m^2 x^2 + mbx + 2my + b$\\n- RHS: $f(x^2) + f(y) + x + y - 1 = mx^2 + (m + 1)y + x + 2b - 1$\\n\\nEquate coefficients:\\n- $x^2$: $m^2 = m \\\\Rightarrow m = 0$ or $m = 1$\\n- $y$: $2m = m + 1 \\\\Rightarrow m = 1$\\n- $x$: $mb = 1 \\\\Rightarrow b = 1$\\n- Constants: $b = 2b - 1 \\\\Rightarrow b = 1$\\n\\nThus, $f(t) = t + 1$ is the solution. Analyzing $f(2y) = f(y) + y$ with $f(t) = at + b$ gives $2ay + b = (a + 1)y + b \\\\Rightarrow a = 1$. Hence, $k = a + 8 = 9$.\\n\\nFor the game with $k = 9$ cells, the maximum moves to end with $2^n$ in one cell is derived from the process of adding $2^0$'s and merging. The maximum moves occur when using all 9 cells to maximize operations. The formula for maximum moves with $k$ cells is $k \\\\cdot 2^n - 1$. For $k = 9$, this is $9 \\\\cdot 2^n - 1$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"9*2^n - 1\"\n}",
