  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We consider linear monic polynomials $ f(x) = x + c $ with integer $ c $. For primes $ p > N $, $ f(p) = p + c $ must be positive, so $ c $ must be negative (let $ c = -k $, $ k > 0 $). The condition $ p \\\\mid 2(f(p)!) + 1 $ implies $ 2(p - k)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. Using Wilson's theorem, $ (p-1)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $, and expanding $ (p-1)! = (p-1)(p-2)\\\\cdots(p-k+1)(p-k)! $, we derive $ (-1)^{k-1}(k-1)!(p-k)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. For this to hold for all large $ p $, the integer equation $ (k-1)! = 2(-1)^{k+1} $ must hold. Testing values, $ k=3 $ satisfies $ 2! = 2 $, so $ c = -3 $. The constant term is $ -3 $, absolute value $ k = 3 $, so $ d = 3 - 2 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume such a function $ f $ exists. Surjectivity implies $ \\\\exists b $ with $ f(b) = -1 $. Then $ f(f(b)) = f(-1) = (b-1)(-1) + 2 = -b + 3 $. From earlier steps (using $ f(1) = 0 $ and $ f(-1) = 1 $), $ f(-1) = 1 $, so $ 1 = -b + 3 \\\\implies b = 2 $. But $ f(2) = 0 $ (derived from functional equations at $ x=0,2 $), contradicting $ f(2) = -1 $. Thus, no such function exists.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
