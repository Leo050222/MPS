Instead of finding all monic polynomials with integer coefficients such that there exists a positive integer $N$ where for every prime $p>N$ with $f(p)$ a positive integer, $p$ divides $2(f(p)!)+1$, simply find $d = k - 2$, where $k$ is the absolute value of the constant term in the unique linear monic polynomial with integer coefficients that satisfies the condition."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We consider linear monic polynomials $ f(x) = x + c $ with integer constant term $ c $. For primes $ p > N $, $ f(p) = p + c $ must be positive, so $ c $ is negative (let $ c = -m $, $ m > 0 $). The condition $ p \\\\mid 2(f(p)!) + 1 $ translates to $ 2((p - m)!) \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. Using Wilson's theorem and properties of factorials modulo primes, we derive that $ (m - 1)! = 2(-1)^{m+1} $. Solving this, $ m = 3 $ is the only solution (since $ 2! = 2 = 2(-1)^4 $). Thus, $ f(x) = x - 3 $, with constant term $ -3 $. The absolute value $ k = 3 $, so $ d = k - 2 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: We analyze the functional equation $ f(f(x)) = (x - 1)f(x) + 2 $ with surjectivity. Constructing specific values: $ f(0) = 2 $, $ f(2) = 0 $, $ f(1) = 0 $, $ f(-1) = 1 $. For other values, we define 2-cycles (e.g., $ f(b) = c $, $ f(c) = (b - 1)c + 2 $) which satisfy the equation. Surjectivity is ensured by covering all real numbers via these cycles and the known values. No contradictions arise, and the construction is valid using the axiom of choice for uncountable sets. Thus, such a function exists.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"Yes\"\n}",
