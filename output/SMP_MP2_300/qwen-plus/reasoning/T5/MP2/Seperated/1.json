Testing constant functions shows only $ f(x) = 0 $ works, but it's excluded as non-constant. Assuming $ f $ is linear, $ f(y) = ky $, substitution yields $ k = 1 $ as the only valid non-constant solution (since $ k = -1 $ fails). Verifying $ f(y) = y $ satisfies the equation, we find $ f(1) = 1 $. Thus, $ k = f(1) + 1 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: For $ A+B $ to have pairwise coprime elements, all elements must be distinct primes (as composites would share factors). However, for finite $ A $ with $ |A| \\\\geq 2 $, $ A+B = \\\\cup_{a \\\\in A} (a + B) $. Within any $ a + B $, infinite $ B $ implies two elements differ by $ d > 1 $, leading to a common divisor $ d $, violating pairwise coprimality. Additionally, Dirichlet's theorem requires primes in all residue classes, but finite $ A $ restricts residues modulo $ |a_i - a_j| $, making it impossible to cover all coprime $ (m, n) $. Hence, no such sets exist.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"no\"\n}",
