For the $ x $ terms, we get $ -2a f(y) + b = f(y) + b $, leading to $ -2a - 1 = 0 $ so $ a = -1/2 $. Thus, $ p = -1/2 $, and $ k = p + 1/2 = 0 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Test polynomial degrees. For $ f(x) = kx^2 $, the equation holds as $ (a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2 = 2(a+b+c)^2 $ when $ ab + bc + ca = 0 $. Higher even degrees like $ x^4 $ were initially considered, but further analysis shows that only quadratic polynomials satisfy the condition for all $ a,b,c $ with $ ab + bc + ca = 0 $. Linear and constant polynomials fail, and higher-degree even polynomials introduce terms that do not cancel universally. Thus, the only solutions are quadratic polynomials of the form $ f(x) = kx^2 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = kx^2 for some real constant k\"\n}",
