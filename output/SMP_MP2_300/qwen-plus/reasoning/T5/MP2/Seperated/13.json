Checking other cases (primes, prime powers, composites with more factors) shows no other solutions. The unique $ n $ is 6, so $ p(n) = 3 $, and $ k = p(n) - 2 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The polynomial $ 1 + xy + x^2y^2 $ cannot be expressed as $ a(x)c(y) + b(x)d(y) $. The coefficient matrix of the polynomial has rank 3, but the sum of two rank-1 matrices (from $ a(x)c(y) $ and $ b(x)d(y) $) can have rank at most 2.
