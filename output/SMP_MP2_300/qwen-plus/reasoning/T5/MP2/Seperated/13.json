Thus, $ p(n) = 3 $, so $ k = p(n) - 2 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The polynomial $ 1 + xy + x^2y^2 $ has a coefficient matrix (in terms of $ x^i y^j $) that is the 3x3 identity matrix, which has rank 3. Expressing it as $ a(x)c(y) + b(x)d(y) $ would require the matrix to have rank at most 2, which is impossible.
