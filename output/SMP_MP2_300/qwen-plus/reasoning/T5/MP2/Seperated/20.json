Setting x=0 gives f(f(y)) = y + c² (c = f(0)). Testing linearity, f(x)=x satisfies the equation: f(x² + f(y)) = x² + y = y + (f(x))². Non-linear solutions are ruled out by additivity and f(x²)=(f(x))², leading to f(x)=x as the only solution.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = x\"\n}",
