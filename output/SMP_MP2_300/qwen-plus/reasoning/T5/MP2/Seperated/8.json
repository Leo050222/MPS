For all real numbers $y$, define $g(y)$ to be the number of distinct real solutions $x$ to the equation $f(f(x))=y$. Suppose that the set of possible values of $g(y)$ over all real numbers $y$ is exactly $\\{1,5,9\\}$. Compute the sum of all possible values of $f(10)$. Instead of computing the sum of all possible values attained by the polynomial at the given argument, simply find $k$, the difference between such an attained value and 969, where the attained value is derived from the structural condition on the number of preimages under the function composition."

For $f(f(x)) = y$ to have $g(y) \\\\in \\\\{1,5,9\\\\}$, analysis shows $a = -3$ (only valid case where critical values align to exclude 3 and 7 solutions). Thus $f(x) = x^3 - 3x$, so $f(10) = 970$.
