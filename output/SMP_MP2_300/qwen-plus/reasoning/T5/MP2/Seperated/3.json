The initial positive integer argument is $n=1$, so $d = x_1 = \\\\binom{2}{1} = 2$. Thus, $m = d + 98 = 2 + 98 = 100$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The expression $|a_i b_j - a_j b_i| = 1$ corresponds to pairs of vectors forming a unimodular basis. The maximum number of such pairs among 100 distinct nonnegative integer pairs is achieved by a sequence where each new pair is the mediant of the previous two, forming a linear chain. This structure ensures each new node (after the first two) connects to exactly two existing nodes, resulting in $2n - 3$ edges for $n$ nodes. For $n = 100$, this gives $2 \\\\times 100 - 3 = 197$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"197\"\n}",
