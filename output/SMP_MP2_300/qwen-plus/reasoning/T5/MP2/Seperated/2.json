Using modular arithmetic, the remainder is $ 2^r $ where $ r = 2^n \\\\mod n $. For $ n = 25 $, $ 2^{25} \\\\mod 25 = 7 $, so the remainder is $ 2^7 = 128 $, which is not a power of 4 (since 128 = $ 2^7 $, and 7 is odd). Thus, $ n = 25 $ is a counter-example. Here, $ r = 7 $, so $ k = r - 5 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Testing constant and linear functions, we find $ f(x) = 0 $ and $ f(x) = x $ satisfy the equation. For $ f(x) = 0 $, both sides are 0. For $ f(x) = x $, the left side simplifies to $ 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) $, matching the right side $ (a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2 $. No other functions satisfy the equation, as shown by testing quadratic forms and additive properties.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=0 and f(x)=x\"\n}",
