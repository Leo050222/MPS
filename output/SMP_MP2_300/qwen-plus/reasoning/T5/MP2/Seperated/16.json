The problem asks for e = k - 39, so e = 41 - 39 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume f(x) = ax + b. Substituting into the functional equation f(xy + f(x)) = xf(y) + 2 leads to solving a³ + a² - 2 = 0, which has a real root a = 1. Then b = 1, giving f(x) = x + 1. Verification shows this satisfies the equation. Uniqueness follows from injectivity and the structure of the equation, confirming f(x) = x + 1 is the only solution.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = x + 1\"\n}",
