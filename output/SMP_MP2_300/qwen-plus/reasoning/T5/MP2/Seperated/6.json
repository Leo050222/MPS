Substituting into the equation yields a = 1, b = 1, so f(x) = x + 1. Thus, f(1) = 2, so k = f(1) - 2 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: Define φ(x) = e^{-x}(f(x) + α). For φ(0) = φ(1), we require α = 1/(e - 1). By Rolle's theorem, this ensures φ'(ξ) = 0 for some ξ ∈ (0,1), which implies f'(ξ) - f(ξ) = α. If α ≠ 1/(e - 1), a counterexample (e.g., f(x) = (e^x - 1)/(e - 1)) shows no such ξ exists. Thus, α must be 1/(e - 1).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/(e-1)\"\n}",
