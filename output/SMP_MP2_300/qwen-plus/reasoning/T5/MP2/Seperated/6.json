Setting $x = 1$ gives $f(y + f(1)) = f(y) + 2$, suggesting linearity. Assuming $f(x) = ax + b$, substitution yields $a = 1$, $b = 1$, so $f(x) = x + 1$. Verifying, $f(1) = 2$, hence $k = 2 - 2 = 0$. This is the only solution due to injectivity and periodicity constraints.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need $\\\\alpha$ such that for all $f$ with $f(0)=0$, $f(1)=1$, there exists $\\\\xi$ with $f(\\\\xi) + \\\\alpha = f'(\\\\xi)$. Define $g(x) = e^{-x}f(x)$, so $g'(x) = e^{-x}(f'(x) - f(x))$. The condition becomes $g'(\\\\xi) = \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\xi}$. For $f(x) = \\\\frac{e^x - 1}{e - 1}$, $f'(x) - f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{e - 1}$ constantly. Thus, $\\\\alpha$ must equal $\\\\frac{1}{e - 1}$. Using Rolle's theorem on $h(x) = g(x) - \\\\frac{1}{e - 1}(1 - e^{-x})$, we confirm this $\\\\alpha$ works for all $f$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/(e-1)\"\n}",
