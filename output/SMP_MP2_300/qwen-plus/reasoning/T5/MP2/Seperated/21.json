Thus κ = f(1) - 1 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: Construct a sequence where F(1) = 0 (to include 0), and for k ≥ 2, partition positive integers into orbits under the map n ↦ n^163. Assign each orbit to a positive integer value, ensuring each positive integer occurs infinitely often. Define F(k) as the orbit index for k ≥ 2. Then F(F(n^163)) = F(F(n)) since n and n^163 are in the same orbit, satisfying condition (c) with c = 0.
