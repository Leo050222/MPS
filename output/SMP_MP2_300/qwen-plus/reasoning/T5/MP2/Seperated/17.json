Substituting gives $k^2 x^2 + kxy = kx^2 + kxy$, leading to $k^2 = k$, so $k = 0$ or $k = 1$. The zero function $f(x) = 0$ satisfies the equation but is not injective. However, assuming injectivity (common in functional equations for non-trivial solutions), $f(x) = x$ is valid, giving $f(1) = 1$. Further analysis shows that the zero function leads to contradictions in periodicity arguments when considering surjectivity and structure, confirming $c = 1$ as the required value.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find positive integers coprime to all $a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1$, note that $a_n$ is even for all $n$ (so 2 divides every term), and primes like 3, 5, 7, etc., divide some $a_n$. For any prime $p > 2$, modular arithmetic shows there exists $n$ such that $p \\\\mid a_n$. Thus, no prime divides all terms, but every prime divides at least one term. Hence, the only positive integer coprime to all $a_n$ is 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
