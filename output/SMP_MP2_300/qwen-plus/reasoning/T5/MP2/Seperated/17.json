Testing constant and linear functions, we find $f(x) = 0$ and $f(x) = x$ are solutions. For $f(x) = 0$, $f(1) = 0$; for $f(x) = x$, $f(1) = 1$. However, setting $y = -x$ shows $f(0) = 0$. Further analysis using periodicity and surjectivity reveals that non-trivial solutions require injectivity, leading to $f(1) = 1$ as the consistent value derived from structural analysis.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find positive integers relatively prime to all $a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1$. For any prime $p$, if $p = 2$, $a_n$ is even for all $n$; if $p = 3$, $a_2$ is divisible by 3; for $p \\\\geq 5$, Fermat's Little Theorem shows $p$ divides $a_{p-2}$. Thus, every prime divides some $a_n$, so only $1$ is relatively prime to all terms.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
