By analyzing small values and using the given conditions, we deduce $ f(n) = \\\\lfloor n/3 \\\\rfloor $. This satisfies all constraints: $ f(2) = 0 $, $ f(3) = 1 > 0 $, and $ f(9999) = 3333 $. Thus, $ f(3) = 1 $, so $ k = f(3) + 1 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need the smallest $ n $ such that any coloring of $ n $ edges among 9 points (no four coplanar) with red/blue contains a monochromatic triangle. The maximum number of edges that can be colored without a monochromatic triangle is 30 (using a complete bipartite graph $ K_{4,5} $ for one color and a triangle-free subgraph of its complement for the other). Adding one more edge (31 total) forces a monochromatic triangle, as any additional edge creates a triangle in one color due to Turán's theorem and Ramsey theory constraints.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"31\"\n}",
