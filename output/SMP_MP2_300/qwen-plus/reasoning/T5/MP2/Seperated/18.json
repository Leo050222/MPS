Given $ f(9999) = 3333 $, using the superadditive property $ f(3k) \\\\geq k f(3) $, we derive $ 3333 \\\\geq 3333 f(3) $, so $ f(3) \\\\leq 1 $. Since $ f(3) > 0 $, $ f(3) = 1 $. Thus, $ k = f(3) + 1 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The maximum number of edges in a 2-colored graph on 9 vertices without a monochromatic triangle is 30 (union of two triangle-free graphs, e.g., $ K_{4,5} $ and a bipartite subgraph of its complement). Any graph with 31 edges must contain a monochromatic triangle, so the smallest $ n $ is 31.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"31\"\n}",
