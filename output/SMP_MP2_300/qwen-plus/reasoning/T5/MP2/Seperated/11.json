The Chebyshev polynomial T₃(2x - 1) on [0,1] has maximum absolute value 1 at the endpoints, a root at x=1/2, and achieves the supremum of the integral. Evaluating at x=1, T₃(1) = 1, so P(1) = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Define q(x) = p(1/x) - x². Given p(1/k) = k² for integers k with 1 ≤ |k| ≤ n, q(k) = 0 for these k. The polynomial x^{2n+2}q(x) is monic of degree 2n+2 with roots at ±1, ..., ±n. Factoring shows the remaining roots correspond to x = ±1/n! as the only other real solutions satisfying p(1/x) = x².\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"±1/n!\"\n}",
