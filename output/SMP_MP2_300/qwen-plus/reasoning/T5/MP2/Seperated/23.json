Testing linear solutions $f(x) = x + k$, we find $k = 1$ satisfies the equation, giving $f(x) = x + 1$. Thus, $f(1) = 2$, so $d = 2 - 1 = 1$. Verification confirms this is the only solution.\\n\\nProblem 2: Consider the Hankel matrix formed by power sums $S_k = k + 1$ for $k = 1, \\\\dots, 9$. The determinant of the $3 \\\\times 3$ Hankel matrix $H_2$ is $1 - n$, where $n$ is the number of elements. For positive semi-definiteness (required for real numbers), $1 - n \\\\geq 0 \\\\implies n \\\\leq 1$. However, $n = 1$ fails since $S_2 = 4 \\\\neq 3$. Thus, no finite set exists.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
