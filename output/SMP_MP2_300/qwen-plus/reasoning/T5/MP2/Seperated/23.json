Testing linear functions, assume $ f(x) = x + 1 $. Substituting into the equation confirms it satisfies the condition. For $ f(1) = 2 $, $ d = 2 - 1 = 1 $. Further analysis shows no other solutions exist due to injectivity and recurrence constraints, confirming $ f(1) = 2 $ is unique.\\n\\nProblem 2: Consider a finite set of real numbers with power sums $ p_k = k + 1 $ for $ k = 1, \\\\dots, 9 $. For any finite set, $ p_k $ must eventually follow a linear recurrence. However, $ p_k = k + 1 $ grows linearly, while power sums of real numbers either grow exponentially (if $ |a_i| > 1 $), are bounded (if $ |a_i| \\\\leq 1 $), or decay (if $ |a_i| < 1 $). Linear growth contradicts exponential behavior for large $ k $, proving no such set exists.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
