This is because in any maximal triangle-free graph, every pair of non-adjacent vertices has a common neighbor (to ensure adding an edge creates a triangle), implying all distances are at most 2. Since the graph isn't complete (triangle-free), diameter is exactly 2. Thus, diam(G)=2, so d=2-2=0.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume f is constant, f(x)=c. Substituting into the equation gives 3c=1 ⇒ c=1/3. Verifying, this satisfies the equation for all x,y,z>0 with xyz=1. To check uniqueness, substitutions (e.g., y=1, z=1/x) lead to functional equations that only hold if f is constant. Non-constant solutions lead to contradictions or inconsistencies, confirming f(x)=1/3 is the only solution.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = 1/3\"\n}",
