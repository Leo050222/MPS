Let $c = f(0)$, so $2f(c) = c^2$. Substituting $x = c, y = 0$ gives $f(f(c)) + f(c) = c f(c)$, leading to $f(f(c)) = (c - 1)f(c)$. Using $f(f(c)) = c f(c) - f(c)$ from the general form derived by setting $y = 0$, equating expressions yields $c^3 - 2c^2 = 0$, so $c = 2$ (since $c \\\\neq 0$). Thus, $d = c - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume $f(x)$ is quadratic, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. Matching coefficients in the functional equation shows $a = 1$, $b = 0$, and $c = 1$. Verifying $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ satisfies the equation for all $x, y$: left-hand side simplifies to $x^2y^2 + 2x - 2y - 3$, matching the right-hand side. No other solutions exist due to coefficient constraints.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"x^2 + 1\"\n}",
