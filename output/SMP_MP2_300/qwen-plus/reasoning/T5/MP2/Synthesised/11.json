Let $n$ be an even positive integer. Let $p$ be a monic, real polynomial of degree $2n$; that is to say, $p(x) = x^{2n} + a_{2n-1} x^{2n-1} + \\cdots + a_1 x + a_0$ for some real coefficients $a_0, \\dots, a_{2n-1}$.

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two parts. First, determining α = P(1) for the extremal cubic polynomial P(x) normalized to have maximum absolute value 1 on [0,1] and a root in [0,1]. The extremal polynomial is identified as the Chebyshev polynomial of degree 3 scaled to [0,1], specifically T₃(2x - 1), which equioscillates between -1 and 1 at four points (x = 0, 1/4, 3/4, 1) and has a root at x = 1/2. For this polynomial, P(1) = 1, so α = 1.\\n\\nFor the second part, given a monic polynomial p(x) of degree 2n satisfying p(1/k) = k² for integers k with 1 ≤ |k| ≤ n, we analyze the equation p(α/x) = x² with α = 1. Substituting α = 1 gives p(1/x) = x². The given conditions imply p(1/k) = k², corresponding to solutions x = k (for k = ±1, ..., ±n). The polynomial construction reveals additional solutions where p(k) = 1/k², leading to x = 1/k. Thus, the solutions to p(1/x) = x² are x = ±k and x = ±1/k for k = 1, ..., n. The 'other' real numbers (excluding those from the given conditions, x = ±k) are x = ±1/k for k = 1, ..., n.\",\n    \"answer\": \"±1/k for k=1,2,...,n\"\n}",
