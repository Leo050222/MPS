  "math_problem": "Let $ (a_{n}) $ be the sequence of reals defined by $ a_{1}=\\frac{1}{4} $ and the recurrence $ a_{n}= \\frac{1}{4}(1+a_{n-1})^{2}, n\\geq 2 $. Find the minimum real $ \\lambda $ such that for any non-negative reals $ x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{2002} $, it holds\n\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^{2002}A_{k}\\leq \\lambda a_{2002}, \\]\nwhere $  A_{k}= \\frac{x_{k}-k}{(x_{k}+\\cdots+x_{2002}+\\frac{k(k-1)}{2}+1)^{2}}, k\\geq 1 $. Instead of determining the infimal constant that majorizes the aggregate of the deviation terms normalized by cumulative sums plus quadratic offsets in terms of the terminal sequence value for all non-negative inputs, simply find $\\delta = t - \\frac{4003}{2}$, where $t$ is the cardinality of the collection of non-negative real variables. Determine all functions $f: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Q}$ such that\n$$f(2xy + \\delta) + f(x-y) = 4f(x)f(y) + \\delta$$\nfor all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding $\\\\delta = t - \\\\frac{4003}{2}$, where $t$ is the cardinality of the collection of non-negative real variables.

Assuming a quadratic form $f(x) = ax^2 + b$, we find $a = 1$ and $b = \\\\frac{1}{4}$ satisfies the equation. Verifying:\\n- $f(0) = \\\\frac{1}{4}$,\\n- $f(x) = x^2 + \\\\frac{1}{4}$ matches all tested values (e.g., $f(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}) = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}$, $f(1) = \\\\tfrac{5}{4}$),\\n- Substituting into the functional equation confirms equality for all $x, y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}$.\\n\\nFurther analysis shows no other solutions exist (e.g., non-quadratic or non-polynomial forms fail coefficient matching or consistency checks). Thus, the only solution is $f(x) = x^2 + \\\\frac{1}{4}$.\",\n  \"answer\": \"x^2 + 1/4\"\n}",
