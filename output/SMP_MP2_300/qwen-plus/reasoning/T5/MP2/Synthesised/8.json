  "math_problem": "Let $f$ be a monic cubic polynomial satisfying $f(x)+f(-x)=0$ for all real numbers $x$. For all real numbers $y$, define $g(y)$ to be the number of distinct real solutions $x$ to the equation $f(f(x))=y$. Suppose that the set of possible values of $g(y)$ over all real numbers $y$ is exactly $\\{1,5,9\\}$. Compute the sum of all possible values of $f(10)$. Instead of computing the sum of all possible values attained by the polynomial at the given argument, simply find $k$, the difference between such an attained value and 969, where the attained value is derived from the structural condition on the number of preimages under the function composition. Four points are chosen uniformly and independently at random in the interior of a given circle. Find the probability that they are the vertices of a convex quadrilateral, which equals $k - \\dfrac{35}{12\\pi^{2}}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves a monic cubic polynomial $ f $ that is odd, so $ f(x) = x^3 + ax $. Given $ f(x) + f(-x) = 0 $, $ a $ must be negative (since $ a \\\\geq 0 $ would make $ f $ strictly increasing, leading to $ g(y) = 1 $ for all $ y $, which doesn't match the required set $ \\\\{1, 5, 9\\\\} $). Let $ a = -3c^2 $ (so $ f(x) = x^3 - 3c^2x $), with $ c > 0 $. The local maxima/minima of $ f $ are $ \\\\pm M $ where $ M = 2c^3 $.\\n\\nAnalyzing $ g(y) $ (number of real solutions to $ f(f(x)) = y $):\\n- For $ |y| > M $: $ f(z) = y $ has 1 real $ z $, and $ |z| > M $, so $ f(x) = z $ has 1 solution $ \\\\Rightarrow g(y) = 1 $.\\n- For $ |y| = M $: $ f(z) = y $ has 2 real $ z $ (one double root, one simple root). If $ c = 1 $, $ M = 2 $, and:\\n  - $ z = -1 $ (double root): $ |z| = 1 < M $, so $ f(x) = -1 $ has 3 solutions.\\n  - $ z = 2 $ (simple root): $ |z| = M $, so $ f(x) = 2 $ has 2 solutions.\\n  Total $ g(y) = 3 + 2 = 5 $.\\n- For $ |y| < M $: $ f(z) = y $ has 3 real $ z $, all with $ |z| < M $, so each $ f(x) = z $ has 3 solutions $ \\\\Rightarrow g(y) = 9 $.\\n\\nThis matches the required set $ \\\\{1, 5, 9\\\\} $ only when $ c = 1 $ (verified by checking other $ c $ values lead to invalid $ g(y) $ sets). Thus, $ f(x) = x^3 - 3x $, so $ f(10) = 10^3 - 3 \\\\cdot 10 = 970 $. The problem asks for $ k = f(10) - 969 = 970 - 969 = 1 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
