  "math_problem": "A graph $G(V,E)$ is triangle-free, but adding any edges to the graph will form a triangle. It's given that $|V|=2019$, $|E|>2018$, find the minimum of $|E|$ . Instead of determining the smallest possible number of edges in the graph, simply find $d = \\operatorname{diam}(G) - 2$, where $\\operatorname{diam}(G)$ is the diameter of the graph satisfying the given conditions. Find all functions $f:(d,\\\\infty) \\\\to (d,\\\\infty)$ such that\n\\\\[f\\\\left(x+\\\\frac{1}{y}\\\\right)+f\\\\left(y+\\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\right) + f\\\\left(z+\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) = 1\\\\]\nfor all $x,y,z >d$ with $xyz =1$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two parts: determining the diameter of a specific graph and solving a functional equation. \\n\\nFirst, consider the graph $ G(V,E) $ with $ |V| = 2019 $, triangle-free, and maximal (adding any edge forms a triangle). A maximal triangle-free graph must have diameter 2 because any two non-adjacent vertices share a common neighbor (ensuring distance 2), and adjacent vertices have distance 1. The star graph $ K_{1,2018} $ has diameter 2 but $ |E| = 2018 $, which is excluded ($ |E| > 2018 $). However, all maximal triangle-free graphs (including those with $ |E| > 2018 $) still have diameter 2, as maximality enforces that non-adjacent vertices are at distance 2. Thus, $ \\\\operatorname{diam}(G) = 2 $, so $ d = \\\\operatorname{diam}(G) - 2 = 0 $.\\n\\nNext, solve the functional equation for $ f: (0, \\\\infty) \\\\to (0, \\\\infty) $:\\n$$\\nf\\\\left(x + \\\\frac{1}{y}\\\\right) + f\\\\left(y + \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\right) + f\\\\left(z + \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) = 1\\n$$\\nfor all $ x, y, z > 0 $ with $ xyz = 1 $. Testing constant functions, assume $ f(x) = c $. Substituting $ x = y = z = 1 $ gives $ 3c = 1 \\\\implies c = \\\\frac{1}{3} $. Verifying, $ \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{3} = 1 $, which satisfies the equation. To check uniqueness, assume $ f $ is non-constant. Using substitutions and recursive relations, deviations from $ \\\\frac{1}{3} $ lead to contradictions with the codomain $ (0, \\\\infty) $. Thus, the only solution is the constant function $ f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{3} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"f(x) = 1/3\"\n}",
