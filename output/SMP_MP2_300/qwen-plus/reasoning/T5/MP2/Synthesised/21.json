Find all functions $f:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, the integer $f(m)+f(n)-mn$ is nonzero and divides $mf(m)+nf(n)$. Instead of finding all functions from positive integers to positive integers such that for all positive integers $m$ and $n$ a certain nonzero integer divides a related linear combination, simply find $\\kappa = f(1) - 1$, where $f(1)$ is the value at $1$ for any function satisfying the given condition.

The key constraint is that for all positive integers $ m, n $, the expression $ f(m) + f(n) - mn $ is nonzero and divides $ mf(m) + nf(n) $.\\n\\nSetting $ m = n = 1 $, we get:\\n$$\\nf(1) + f(1) - 1 \\\\cdot 1 = 2f(1) - 1 \\\\quad \\\\text{divides} \\\\quad 1 \\\\cdot f(1) + 1 \\\\cdot f(1) = 2f(1).\\n$$\\nLet $ k = f(1) $. Then $ 2k - 1 \\\\mid 2k $. Since $ 2k = (2k - 1) + 1 $, it follows that $ 2k - 1 \\\\mid 1 $. The only positive integer divisor of 1 is 1 itself, so $ 2k - 1 = 1 \\\\Rightarrow k = 1 $. Thus, $ f(1) = 1 $, and hence $ \\\\kappa = f(1) - 1 = 0 $.\\n\\nThe second part of the problem asks whether a sequence $ F $ exists satisfying certain conditions based on $ \\\\kappa = 0 $. However, the problem explicitly states: \\\"Instead of finding all functions... simply find $ \\\\kappa = f(1) - 1 $\\\". This indicates that the primary task is to compute $ \\\\kappa $, which has been determined as 0. The rest of the problem (about the sequence $ F $) is context but not required for the final answer, as the instructions specify to provide $ \\\\kappa $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
