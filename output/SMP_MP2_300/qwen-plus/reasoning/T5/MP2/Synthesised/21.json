Find all functions $f:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, the integer $f(m)+f(n)-mn$ is nonzero and divides $mf(m)+nf(n)$. Instead of finding all functions from positive integers to positive integers such that for all positive integers $m$ and $n$ a certain nonzero integer divides a related linear combination, simply find $\\kappa = f(1) - 1$, where $f(1)$ is the value at $1$ for any function satisfying the given condition. Does there exist a sequence $ F(1), F(2), F(3), \\ldots$ of non-negative integers that simultaneously satisfies the following three conditions?\n\n(a) Each of the integers greater than or equal to $\\kappa$ occurs in the sequence.\n\n(b) For every positive integer $\\ell$ and every integer $M \\geq \\kappa$, there exists $n > M$ such that $F(n) = \\ell$.\n\n(c) For any $ n \\geq 2,$\n\\[\n F(F(n^{163})) = F(F(n)) + F(F(361)).\n\\]",

This implies $ 2f(1) - 1 \\\\mid 1 $, so $ 2f(1) - 1 = 1 $, giving $ f(1) = 1 $. Thus, $ \\\\kappa = f(1) - 1 = 0 $.\\n\\nTesting $ f(n) = n^2 $, we verify it satisfies the condition: $ f(m) + f(n) - mn = m^2 + n^2 - mn $, which divides $ mf(m) + nf(n) = m^3 + n^3 = (m + n)(m^2 - mn + n^2) $. This confirms $ f(n) = n^2 $ is a solution, and further analysis shows it is the only solution. Hence, $ f(1) = 1 $, so $ \\\\kappa = 0 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
