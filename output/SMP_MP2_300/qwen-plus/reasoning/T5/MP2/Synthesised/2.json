  "math_problem": "Consider the assertion that for each positive integer $n \\\\ge 2$ , the remainder upon dividing $2^{2^n}$ by $2^n-1$ is a power of 4. Either prove the assertion or find (with proof) a counter-example. Instead of proving the assertion or finding a counter-example, simply find $k = r - 5$, where $r$ is the remainder when $2^n$ is divided by $n$ in the analysis of the counter-example to the assertion. Find all functions $f:\\\\mathbb {Z}\\\\to\\\\mathbb Z$, satisfy that for any integer ${a}$, ${b}$, ${c}$,\n$$2f(a^k+b^k+c^2)-2f(ab+bc+ca)=f(a-b)^k+f(b-c)^k+f(c-a)^2$$",
