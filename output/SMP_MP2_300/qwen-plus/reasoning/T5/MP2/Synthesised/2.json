  "math_problem": "Consider the assertion that for each positive integer $n \\\\ge 2$ , the remainder upon dividing $2^{2^n}$ by $2^n-1$ is a power of 4. Either prove the assertion or find (with proof) a counter-example. Instead of proving the assertion or finding a counter-example, simply find $k = r - 5$, where $r$ is the remainder when $2^n$ is divided by $n$ in the analysis of the counter-example to the assertion. Find all functions $f:\\\\mathbb {Z}\\\\to\\\\mathbb Z$, satisfy that for any integer ${a}$, ${b}$, ${c}$,\n$$2f(a^k+b^k+c^2)-2f(ab+bc+ca)=f(a-b)^k+f(b-c)^k+f(c-a)^2$$",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves finding a counter-example to the assertion that for each $ n \\\\ge 2 $, the remainder when $ 2^{2^n} $ is divided by $ 2^n - 1 $ is a power of 4. By analyzing the structure of modular arithmetic, it is shown that the remainder equals $ 2^s $ where $ s = 2^n \\\\mod n $. The assertion fails when $ s $ is odd, as $ 2^s $ would not be a power of 4. Testing values, $ n = 25 $ is a counter-example: $ 2^{25} \\\\mod 25 = 7 $ (odd), so the remainder $ 2^7 = 128 $ is not a power of 4. Here, $ r = 7 $, so $ k = r - 5 = 2 $. \\n\\nNext, solving the functional equation with $ k = 2 $:\\n$$\\n2f(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - 2f(ab + bc + ca) = f(a-b)^2 + f(b-c)^2 + f(c-a)^2\\n$$\\nTesting constant and linear functions reveals that $ f(x) = 0 $ and $ f(x) = x $ satisfy the equation. Further analysis shows no other solutions exist, as non-linear or mixed functions lead to contradictions. Thus, the only solutions are $ f(x) = 0 $ and $ f(x) = x $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0 and x\"\n}",
