  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the functional equation to find $k = f(1) - 2$. Assume $f(x) = ax + b$. Substituting into $f(xy + f(x)) = xf(y) + 2$ gives $a = 1$, $b = 1$, so $f(x) = x + 1$. Thus, $f(1) = 2$, so $k = 2 - 2 = 0$.\\n\\nNext, determine all $\\\\alpha$ such that for every continuous $f: [0,1] \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ (differentiable on $(0,1)$) with $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, there exists $\\\\xi \\\\in (0,1)$ with $f(\\\\xi) + \\\\alpha = f'(\\\\xi)$. Define $F(x) = e^{-x}f(x) - \\\\alpha(1 - e^{-x})$. Then $F(0) = 0$ and $F(1) = e^{-1} - \\\\alpha(1 - e^{-1})$. For Rolle's theorem to apply for all $f$, set $F(1) = 0$, yielding $\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{e - 1}$. This is the only $\\\\alpha$ that works for all such $f$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/(e-1)\"\n}",
