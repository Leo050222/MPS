  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the functional equation $f(xy + f(x)) = xf(y) + 2$ for $f:\\\\mathbb{R}^+ \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^+$. Setting $x = 1$, we get $f(y + f(1)) = f(y) + 2$, suggesting $f$ is linear. Assume $f(x) = ax + b$. Substituting into the equation yields $a = 1$, $b = 1$, so $f(x) = x + 1$. Thus, $f(1) = 2$, giving $k = f(1) - 2 = 0$.\\n\\nNext, determine $\\\\alpha$ such that for every continuous $f:[0,1] \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$, differentiable on $(0,1)$, with $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, there exists $\\\\xi \\\\in (0,1)$ where $f(\\\\xi) + \\\\alpha = f'(\\\\xi)$. Define $\\\\phi(x) = e^{-x}f(x) - \\\\alpha(1 - e^{-x})$. For $\\\\phi(0) = \\\\phi(1) = 0$, we require $\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{e - 1}$. By Rolle's theorem, $\\\\phi'(\\\\xi) = 0$ implies $f'(\\\\xi) - f(\\\\xi) = \\\\alpha$. This $\\\\alpha$ works for all such $f$, and no other $\\\\alpha$ does (e.g., constant $h(x) = f'(x) - f(x)$ for specific $f$ forces $\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{e - 1}$).\",\n    \"answer\": \"1/(e-1)\"\n}",
