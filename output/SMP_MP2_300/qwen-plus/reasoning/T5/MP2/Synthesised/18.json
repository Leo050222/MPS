  "math_problem": "The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers and takes non-negative integer values. $f(2)=0,f(3)>0,f(9999)=3333$ and for all $m,n:$ \\[ f(m+n)-f(m)-f(n)=0 \\text{ or } 1. \\] Determine $f(1982)$. Instead of determining the value attained by the function at 1982, simply find $k = f(3) + 1$, where $f(3)$ is the positive integer value attained by the function at 3. Consider $9$ points in space, no four of which are coplanar. Each pair of points is joined by an edge (that is, a line segment) and each edge is either colored with one of $k$ colors or left uncolored. Find the smallest value of $\\,n\\,$ such that whenever exactly $\\,n\\,$ edges are colored, the set of colored edges necessarily contains a triangle all of whose edges have the same color.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main parts: determining $ k = f(3) + 1 $ from a functional equation and using $ k $ to find the smallest $ n $ such that any coloring of $ n $ edges in a 9-vertex graph with $ k $ colors necessarily contains a monochromatic triangle.\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine $ f(3) $\\n\\nThe function $ f(n) $ satisfies:\\n- $ f(2) = 0 $\\n- $ f(3) > 0 $\\n- $ f(9999) = 3333 $\\n- For all $ m, n $, $ f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) \\\\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\} $\\n\\nThis implies $ f $ is approximately linear. Testing small values:\\n- $ f(1) = 0 $ (from $ f(2) = 2f(1) + d $, $ d \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\} $)\\n- $ f(3) = 1 $ (from $ f(3) - f(2) - f(1) \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\} $ and $ f(3) > 0 $)\\n- Verifying $ f(n) = \\\\lfloor n/3 \\\\rfloor $ satisfies all conditions:\\n  - $ f(2) = 0 $, $ f(3) = 1 $, $ f(9999) = 3333 $\\n  - $ f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\} $ holds for all $ m, n $\\n\\nThus, $ f(3) = 1 $, so $ k = f(3) + 1 = 2 $.\\n\\n### Step 2: Find the smallest $ n $ for the graph problem\\n\\nGiven $ k = 2 $, we need the smallest $ n $ such that any 2-coloring of $ n $ edges in $ K_9 $ (9 vertices) contains a monochromatic triangle.\\n\\n- The maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on 9 vertices is $ \\\\text{ex}(9, K_3) = 20 $ (Turán's theorem: complete bipartite $ K_{4,5} $).\\n- To avoid monochromatic triangles, the colored edges must be partitioned into two triangle-free subgraphs.\\n- The maximum number of edges that can be colored without a monochromatic triangle is $ 20 + 10 = 30 $:\\n  - Color 1: $ K_{4,5} $ (20 edges, triangle-free)\\n  - Color 2: Triangle-free subgraph in the complement (10 edges: 4 in $ K_4 $, 6 in $ K_5 $)\\n- Any 31 edges cannot be partitioned into two triangle-free subgraphs (by pigeonhole principle and structure constraints), so a monochromatic triangle is unavoidable.\\n\\nThus, the smallest $ n $ is $ 30 + 1 = 31 $.\", \"answer\": \"31\"}",
