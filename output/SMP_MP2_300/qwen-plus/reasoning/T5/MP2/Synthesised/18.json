  "math_problem": "The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers and takes non-negative integer values. $f(2)=0,f(3)>0,f(9999)=3333$ and for all $m,n:$ \\[ f(m+n)-f(m)-f(n)=0 \\text{ or } 1. \\] Determine $f(1982)$. Instead of determining the value attained by the function at 1982, simply find $k = f(3) + 1$, where $f(3)$ is the positive integer value attained by the function at 3. Consider $9$ points in space, no four of which are coplanar. Each pair of points is joined by an edge (that is, a line segment) and each edge is either colored with one of $k$ colors or left uncolored. Find the smallest value of $\\,n\\,$ such that whenever exactly $\\,n\\,$ edges are colored, the set of colored edges necessarily contains a triangle all of whose edges have the same color.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two parts: determining $ k = f(3) + 1 $ from a functional equation and then using $ k $ to solve a graph coloring problem.\\n\\n**Part 1: Determining $ k = f(3) + 1 $**\\n\\nThe function $ f(n) $ satisfies:\\n- $ f(2) = 0 $\\n- $ f(3) > 0 $\\n- $ f(9999) = 3333 $\\n- For all $ m, n $, $ f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) \\\\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\} $\\n\\nAnalyzing small values:\\n- $ f(1) = 0 $ (from $ f(2) = f(1+1) = 2f(1) + d $, $ d \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\} $)\\n- $ f(3) = f(2+1) = f(2) + f(1) + d = 0 + 0 + d $. Since $ f(3) > 0 $, $ d = 1 $, so $ f(3) = 1 $\\n- Generalizing, for $ n = 3q + r $ ($ r = 0,1,2 $), $ f(n) = q $. This satisfies the functional equation because:\\n  - If $ r_1 + r_2 < 3 $, $ f(m+n) = q_1 + q_2 = f(m) + f(n) $\\n  - If $ r_1 + r_2 \\\\geq 3 $, $ f(m+n) = q_1 + q_2 + 1 = f(m) + f(n) + 1 $\\n- Verifying $ f(9999) $: $ 9999 = 3 \\\\times 3333 $, so $ f(9999) = 3333 $, which matches.\\n\\nThus, $ f(3) = 1 $, so $ k = f(3) + 1 = 2 $.\\n\\n**Part 2: Graph Coloring Problem**\\n\\nWe need the smallest $ n $ such that any coloring of $ n $ edges (with $ k = 2 $ colors) on 9 vertices contains a monochromatic triangle.\\n\\n- Total edges in $ K_9 $: $ \\\\binom{9}{2} = 36 $\\n- Maximum triangle-free graph on 9 vertices (Mantel's theorem): $ \\\\lfloor 9^2 / 4 \\\\rfloor = 20 $ (complete bipartite $ K_{4,5} $)\\n- Non-edges of $ K_{4,5} $: two cliques $ K_4 $ (6 edges) and $ K_5 $ (10 edges)\\n- Maximum triangle-free subgraph of $ K_4 $: $ \\\\lfloor 4^2 / 4 \\\\rfloor = 4 $\\n- Maximum triangle-free subgraph of $ K_5 $: $ \\\\lfloor 5^2 / 4 \\\\rfloor = 6 $\\n- Total edges for two triangle-free color classes: $ 20 + (4 + 6) = 30 $\\n\\nThus, the maximum number of edges that can be 2-colored without a monochromatic triangle is 30. Therefore, the smallest $ n $ where any $ n $ edges must contain a monochromatic triangle is $ 30 + 1 = 31 $.\", \"answer\": \"31\"}",
