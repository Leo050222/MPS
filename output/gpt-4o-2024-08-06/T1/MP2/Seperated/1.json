  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:\nKamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. on Friday. At that time, the computer had been on for exactly 100 hours. We need to find out when she turned the computer on.\n\nStep 1: Understand that 100 hours before 5 p.m. Friday is the time the computer was turned on.\n\nStep 2: Convert 100 hours into days and hours:\n100 hours ÷ 24 hours/day = 4 full days and 4 hours (because 4 × 24 = 96, and 100 - 96 = 4)\n\nStep 3: Count back 4 full days and 4 hours from 5 p.m. Friday.\n\n- Four days before Friday 5 p.m. is Monday 5 p.m.\n- Four hours before 5 p.m. is 1 p.m.\n\nSo, Kamile turned the computer on at 1 p.m. on Monday.\n\nProblem 2:\nThe list is {2, 3, 4, 6}. We need to find three different numbers from this list that sum to 11, and then find their product.\n\nStep 1: Check all possible combinations of three different numbers from the list:\n- 2, 3, 4: Sum = 9\n- 2, 3, 6: Sum = 11 (candidate)\n- 2, 4, 6: Sum = 12\n- 3, 4, 6: Sum = 13\n\nStep 2: Only the combination 2, 3, and 6 sums to 11.\n\nStep 3: Calculate their product:\n2 × 3 × 6 = 36\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Kamile turned off the computer at 5 p.m. Friday after it had been on for 100 hours. 100 hours is 4 full days and 4 hours. Counting backward 4 days from 5 p.m. Friday is 5 p.m. Monday, and subtracting an additional 4 hours leads to 1 p.m. Monday. So, the computer was turned on at 1 p.m. Monday. Problem 2: The three different numbers from the list {2,3,4,6} that sum to 11 are 2, 3, and 6. Their product is 2*3*6=36.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1 p.m. Monday\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"36\"\n}",
