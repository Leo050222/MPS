  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:\nGiven \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers, with \\( x > y \\), and the equation:\n\\[\nx + xy = 391\n\\]\nWe can factor the left side:\n\\[\nx(1 + y) = 391\n\\]\nSo \\( x \\) and \\( 1 + y \\) are factors of 391. Since \\( x > y \\), we also have \\( x > y \\implies x > y \\), which is a bit ambiguous, but actually we need to find integer factors \\(x\\) and \\(1+y\\) of 391 such that \\(x > y\\).\n\nFirst, find the factors of 391:\n- 391 is not an obviously small product, but let’s check if it factors.\n\nCheck if 391 is divisible by small primes:\n- 2? No (odd)\n- 3? \\(3 \\times 130 = 390\\), no\n- 5? No\n- 7? \\(7 \\times 55 = 385\\), no\n- 11? \\(11 \\times 35 = 385\\), no\n- 13? \\(13 \\times 30 = 390\\), no\n- 17? \\(17 \\times 23 = 391\\), yes!\n\nSo the factor pairs of 391 are (1, 391) and (17, 23) and (23,17) and (391,1).\n\nSince \\(x(1+y) = 391\\), possible pairs:\n\n1) \\(x = 1\\), \\(1 + y = 391 \\implies y = 390\\) but \\(x > y\\) is false here (1 < 390). Not valid.\n\n2) \\(x = 17\\), \\(1 + y = 23 \\implies y = 22\\). Check if \\(x > y\\): 17 > 22? No. Not valid.\n\n3) \\(x = 23\\), \\(1 + y = 17 \\implies y = 16\\). Check \\(x > y\\): 23 > 16? Yes. Valid.\n\n4) \\(x = 391\\), \\(1 + y = 1 \\implies y = 0\\) but \\(y\\) positive integer requires \\(y \\geq 1\\). Not valid.\n\nTherefore, only \\(x=23\\), \\(y=16\\) satisfy the conditions.\n\nThen:\n\\[\nx + y = 23 + 16 = 39\n\\]\n\n---\n\nProblem 2:\nThere are 30 people in the room, 60% of whom are men.\n\nCalculate number of men initially:\n\\[\n30 \\times 0.6 = 18 \\text{ men}\n\\]\n\nNumber of women initially:\n\\[\n30 - 18 = 12 \\text{ women}\n\\]\n\nNo men enter or leave. Let \\(w\\) be the number of women that must enter.\n\nAfter \\(w\\) women enter:\n- Total people = \\(30 + w\\)\n- Men still = 18\n- Women = \\(12 + w\\)\n\nWe want men to be 40% of total, so:\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{30 + w} = 0.4\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(w\\):\n\\[\n18 = 0.4 (30 + w)\n\\]\n\\[\n18 = 12 + 0.4w\n\\]\n\\[\n18 - 12 = 0.4w\n\\]\n\\[\n6 = 0.4w\n\\]\n\\[\nw = \\frac{6}{0.4} = 15\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 15 women must enter.\n\n---\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Starting from the equation x + xy = 391, factor to x(1+y) = 391. The positive integer factor pairs of 391 are (1,391), (17,23), (23,17), and (391,1). Considering the constraint x > y and both positive integers, the valid pair is (x,y) = (23,16). Their sum is 39. Problem 2: Initially, there are 18 men (60% of 30) and 12 women. No men leave or enter. To have men be 40% of the room population after adding w women, solve 18 / (30 + w) = 0.4 giving w = 15.
