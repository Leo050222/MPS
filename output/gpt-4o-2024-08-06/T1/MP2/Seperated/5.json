  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:\n\nLet the number of skateboards be 7x and the number of bicycles be 4x since the ratio is 7:4.\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of skateboards is 12 more than the number of bicycles:\n\n7x = 4x + 12\n\nSubtract 4x from both sides:\n\n7x - 4x = 12\n\n3x = 12\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 4\n\nNow, the number of skateboards = 7x = 7*4 = 28\n\nThe number of bicycles = 4x = 4*4 = 16\n\nTherefore, the total number of skateboards and bicycles is 28 + 16 = 44.\n\n----\n\nProblem 2:\n\nInitial candies:\n\nRed = 10\n\nYellow = 7\n\nBlue = 3\n\nAfter eating some candies, the numbers of candies of each color are equal.\n\nLet the final equal number of candies of each color be k.\n\nWe need to find the maximum k such that:\n\nk <= 10 (since we can't have more than the initial number)\n\nk <= 7\n\nk <= 3\n\nSo k can be at most 3.\n\nNow, how many candies are eaten?\n\nRed eaten = 10 - k = 10 - 3 = 7\n\nYellow eaten = 7 - 3 = 4\n\nBlue eaten = 3 - 3 = 0\n\nTotal eaten = 7 + 4 + 0 = 11\n\nNo other k > 3 is possible, and smaller k would mean fewer candies remain but more candies eaten in total (since more must be eaten to reduce to smaller numbers).\n\nSo the smallest possible total candies eaten is 11.\n\n----\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let the numbers be 7x (skateboards) and 4x (bicycles). Given 7x = 4x + 12, solving gives x=4. So skateboards=28, bicycles=16, total=44. Problem 2: The final equal number of candies k should be at most the smallest initial count, which is 3.
