  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:  \nWe are given that x and y are positive integers and x + y = 31. We want to maximize the product xy.  \n\nStep 1: Write y in terms of x: y = 31 - x.  \nStep 2: Write the product as a function of x: P(x) = x(31 - x) = 31x - x^2.  \nStep 3: P(x) is a quadratic function that opens downward (because the coefficient of x^2 is -1). Its maximum value occurs at the vertex.  \nStep 4: The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by -b/(2a), where the quadratic is ax^2 + bx + c. Here, a = -1 and b = 31.  \nx = -31 / (2 * -1) = 31/2 = 15.5  \nStep 5: Since x must be a positive integer, we check the two nearest integers 15 and 16.  \nP(15) = 15 * (31 - 15) = 15 * 16 = 240  \nP(16) = 16 * (31 - 16) = 16 * 15 = 240  \nSo the maximum product is 240.  \n\n---\n\nProblem 2:  \nWe are given two points: A(-9, -2) and B(6, 8). We want to find how many points on the line segment AB have both coordinates as integers.  \n\nStep 1: Find the vector from A to B:  \nΔx = 6 - (-9) = 15  \nΔy = 8 - (-2) = 10  \n\nStep 2: The line segment can be parameterized as:  \n(x, y) = (-9 + 15t, -2 + 10t), where t ∈ [0, 1]  \n\nStep 3: For (x, y) to be integers, we want  \n-9 + 15t ∈ integers  \n-2 + 10t ∈ integers  \n\nStep 4: Since -9 and -2 are integers, 15t and 10t must be integers. That is,  \n15t = integer  \n10t = integer  \n\nStep 5: For t to satisfy both conditions, t must be a rational number such that 15t and 10t are integers simultaneously.  \n\nStep 6: Let t = k / m in lowest terms. Then 15t = 15(k/m) and 10t = 10(k/m) must be integers.  \nThis means that m divides both 15k and 10k. Since k/m is in lowest terms, m must divide gcd(15, 10) = 5.  \n\nStep 7: So the denominator m divides 5. Possible m values: 1 or 5 (because m must be positive integer).  \n\nStep 8: The values of t for integer coordinates are t = n/5, where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (since t ∈ [0, 1]).  \n\nStep 9: For n=0 to 5, t = 0, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1, all produce integer points on the segment.  \n\nStep 10: Number of such points = 6.  \n\n---\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Given x + y = 31 with x,y positive integers, the product xy is maximized when x and y are as close as possible to each other. The vertex of the parabola P(x) = 31x - x^2 is at x=15.5, so checking x=15 and x=16 gives max product 240. Problem 2: The points from (-9,-2) to (6,8) have vector Δx=15, Δy=10. Integer coordinate points on the segment occur when parameter t = n/5 with n=0 to 5 (inclusive), giving 6 points in total.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"240\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
