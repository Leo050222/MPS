  "math_problem": "Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. Friday, at which point it had been on for exactly 100 hours. At what time had Kamile turned her computer on? Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day. Three different numbers from the list $2, 3, 4, 6$ have a sum of $k$. What is the product of these numbers?",

We want to find the value of k = h + 7, where h is the remainder when the total time (100 hours) is divided by the number of hours in a day (24 hours).\\n\\nStep 1: Calculate the remainder h when 100 is divided by 24.\\n100 ÷ 24 = 4 remainder 4 (since 24 * 4 = 96, and 100 - 96 = 4).\\nSo, h = 4.\\n\\nStep 2: Compute k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11.\\n\\nStep 3: Check three different numbers from the list {2, 3, 4, 6} whose sum is k = 11.\\nTry combinations:\\n- 2 + 3 + 4 = 9\\n- 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 ✔\\n- 2 + 4 + 6 = 12\\n- 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\\n\\nThe only combination of three different numbers from {2, 3, 4, 6} to get sum 11 is {2, 3, 6}.\\n\\nStep 4: Find the product of these numbers: 2 * 3 * 6 = 36.\",\n    \"answer\": \"36\"\n}",
