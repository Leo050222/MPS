  "math_problem": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$. Shuxin begins with $d$ red candies, 7 yellow candies, and 3 blue candies. After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining. What is the smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate?",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. We have the ratio of skateboards to bicycles as 7:4. Let the scaling factor be \\( k \\), so the number of skateboards is \\( 7k \\) and the number of bicycles is \\( 4k \\).\n\n2. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles:\n   \\[\n   7k - 4k = 12 \\implies 3k = 12 \\implies k = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. Therefore, the number of skateboards is \\( 7 \\times 4 = 28 \\) and the number of bicycles is \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\).\n\n4. We are instructed to find \\( d = k + 6 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   d = 4 + 6 = 10\n   \\]\n\n---\n\nNext part of the problem:\n\n- Shuxin begins with:\n  - Red candies: \\( d = 10 \\)\n  - Yellow candies: 7\n  - Blue candies: 3\n\n- After eating some candies, the number of remaining red, yellow, and blue candies must be equal.\n\nLet the number of candies remaining be \\( x \\) for each color.\n\nThen Shuxin eats:\n- Red candies eaten = \\( 10 - x \\)\n- Yellow candies eaten = \\( 7 - x \\)\n- Blue candies eaten = \\( 3 - x \\)\n\nBecause Shuxin can't eat more candies than she has in any color, \\( x \\leq 3 \\).\n\nAlso, the number of candies eaten must be non-negative.\n\n---\n\nWe want to minimize the total number of candies eaten:\n\n\\[\n(10 - x) + (7 - x) + (3 - x) = 20 - 3x\n\\]\n\nTry values of \\( x \\) from 3 down to 0:\n\n- \\( x = 3 \\): Total eaten = \\( 20 - 9 = 11 \\)\n- \\( x = 2 \\): Total eaten = \\( 20 - 6 = 14 \\)\n- \\( x = 1 \\): Total eaten = \\( 20 - 3 = 17 \\)\n- \\( x = 0 \\): Total eaten = 20\n\nThe candies left must be equal, and \\( x \\leq 3 \\) (smallest initial count is 3 blue candies).\n\nThe maximal \\( x \\) is 3 to have equal remaining candies, which yields the minimal candies eaten = 11.\n\n---\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Given the ratio of skateboards to bicycles 7:4 and 12 more skateboards, the scaling factor k=4. Hence, d=k+6=10. Shuxin starts with 10 red, 7 yellow, and 3 blue candies. After eating some candies to have equal remaining counts in each color (x), the maximum x is 3 (due to blue candies). Total candies eaten is then (10-x)+(7-x)+(3-x) = 20 - 3x. The minimal candies eaten occurs when x=3, total eaten = 11.\",\n  \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
