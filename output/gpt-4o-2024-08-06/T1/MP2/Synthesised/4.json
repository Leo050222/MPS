  "math_problem": "Storage space on a computer is measured in gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB), where $1 \\mathrm{~GB} = 1024 \\mathrm{MB}$. Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes. The regular price for a bicycle is $\\\\$320$. The bicycle is on sale for $20\\\\%$ off. The regular price for a helmet is $\\\\$80$. The helmet is on sale for $10\\\\%$ off. If Sandra bought both items on sale, her percentage savings on the total purchase is $\\left( \\frac{\\text{total savings}}{\\text{total price}} \\right) \\times d\\\\%$. Compute this value.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Convert the hard drive capacity from GB to MB.\\nGiven: 1 GB = 1024 MB, hard drive capacity C = 300 GB.\\nC = 300 * 1024 = 307200 MB.\\n\\nStep 2: Compute d = C - 307100 = 307200 - 307100 = 100.\\n\\nStep 3: Calculate the savings and sale prices:\\n- Bicycle regular price = $320\\n- Bicycle sale discount = 20% off\\n- Bicycle sale price = 320 * (1 - 0.20) = 320 * 0.80 = $256\\n- Bicycle savings = 320 - 256 = $64\\n\\n- Helmet regular price = $80\\n- Helmet sale discount = 10% off\\n- Helmet sale price = 80 * (1 - 0.10) = 80 * 0.90 = $72\\n- Helmet savings = 80 - 72 = $8\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate total price and total savings:\\n- Total price on sale = 256 + 72 = $328\\n- Total savings = 64 + 8 = $72\\n\\nStep 5: Compute the percentage savings on the total purchase:\\n= (total savings / total price) * d %\\n= (72 / 328) * 100\\n\\nCalculate (72 / 328) * 100:\\n72 / 328 = 0.21951219512195122\\n0.21951219512195122 * 100 = 21.951219512195122\\n\\nStep 6: Final value = 21.951219512195122\\n\\nThe exact value is 72/328 * 100. Let's simplify 72/328.\\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8:\\n72/8 = 9\\n328/8 = 41\\nSo 72/328 = 9/41\\nTherefore, the value = (9/41) * 100 = 900/41.\\n\\n900 divided by 41 is approximately 21.9512195122, but the exact value is 900/41.\\n\\nHence, the answer is 900/41.\\n\\n\\n{  \\n  \\\"answer\\\": \\\"900/41\\\"  \\n}\",\n  \"answer\": \"900/41\"\n}",
