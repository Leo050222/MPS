  "math_problem": "If \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers with \\( x>y \\) and \\( x+x y=391 \\), what is the value of \\( x+y \\)? Instead of finding the sum of the two positive integers satisfying the given equation and inequality, simply find \\( k = y + 14 \\), where \\( y \\) is the smaller positive integer in the pair that solves the equation under the stated conditions. There are \\( k \\) people in a room, 60% of whom are men. If no men enter or leave the room, how many women must enter the room so that 40% of the total number of people in the room are men?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Solve for x and y\\nGiven: x and y are positive integers, x > y, and x + xy = 391.\\nRewrite the equation as x + x*y = x(1 + y) = 391.\\nSince 391 = x(1 + y), x and 1 + y are factors of 391.\\nFactor 391:\\n391 = 17 * 23\\nPossible factor pairs (x, 1 + y): (1, 391), (17, 23), (23, 17), (391, 1).\\nSince x > y and both positive, consider:\\n- x = 17, 1 + y = 23 => y = 22\\n- x = 23, 1 + y = 17 => y = 16\\nCheck the inequality x > y:\\n- For x = 17, y = 22, 17 > 22? No.\\n- For x = 23, y = 16, 23 > 16? Yes.\\nThus, the solution is x = 23, y = 16.\\n\\nStep 2: Find k = y + 14\\nk = 16 + 14 = 30.\\n\\nStep 3: Given there are k = 30 people in the room.\\n60% are men, so men = 0.6 * 30 = 18.\\nWomen = 30 - 18 = 12.\\n\\nStep 4: Women must enter so that men are 40% of the total.\\nLet w be the number of women entering.\\nNew total = 30 + w.\\nMen remain the same = 18.\\n40% men => 0.4 * (30 + w) = 18\\n0.4 * (30 + w) = 18\\n30 + w = 18 / 0.4 = 45\\nw = 45 - 30 = 15.\\n\\nTherefore, 15 women must enter the room.\\n\\nFinal answer = 15.\",\n  \"answer\": \"15\"\n}",
