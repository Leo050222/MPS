  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:\nWe have a pile of 2015 rocks. In each round, if there are N rocks, Alice removes k rocks where k is chosen uniformly at random from {1, 2, ..., N}. She continues until the pile is empty.\n\nWe want the probability p that after each round the number of rocks left is a multiple of 5.\n\nLet's denote by P(n) the probability that starting with n rocks, the number of rocks left after each round is always a multiple of 5. We want P(2015).\n\nNote:\n\n- The process ends when there are 0 rocks.\n\n- After each round, the count must be a multiple of 5.\n\nSo the states where this can hold are only multiples of 5 (including 0).\n\nThus, if n is not a multiple of 5, then P(n)=0 because the pile size after the round must be a multiple of 5; if starting from n is not multiple of 5, the first step is invalid.\n\nSince 2015 is a multiple of 5 (2015 = 5*403), P(2015) is what we want.\n\nDefine P(m) for m multiple of 5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2015.\n\nFor m=0, P(0)=1 (already empty).\n\nFor other m (>0), from m, Alice removes k rocks (1 ≤ k ≤ m) uniformly at random. The pile becomes m-k.\n\nCondition: the number after removal must be multiple of 5.\n\nSo for P(m),\n\nP(m) = Probability over random k ∈ {1,...,m}, that m-k is multiple of 5 and the sequence continues with P(m-k).\n\nBecause if m-k is not multiple of 5, the sequence fails.\n\nEquivalently,\n\nP(m) = (Number of k in {1,...,m} such that m-k ≡ 0 mod 5)* (average of P(m-k) over those k) * (1/m).\n\nBut let's write explicitly:\n\nP(m) = (1/m) * sum_{k=1 to m, m-k mod 5=0} P(m-k).\n\nBut m-k ≡ 0 mod 5 means k ≡ m mod 5.\n\nSince m is multiple of 5, m ≡ 0 mod 5.\n\nSo k ≡ 0 mod 5.\n\nMeaning k is a multiple of 5.\n\nTherefore,\n\nP(m) = (1/m)* sum_{k=1 to m, k mod 5=0} P(m-k)\n\nNote the set of k satisfying k mod 5=0 and 1 ≤ k ≤ m is:\n\nk = 5, 10, 15, ..., 5 * floor(m/5) = m (since m is multiple of 5)\n\nSo the valid k are {5, 10, 15, ..., m}\n\nTotal number of such k = m/5.\n\nTherefore,\n\nP(m) = (1/m) * sum_{j=1 to m/5} P(m - 5j), where j indexes steps of 5.\n\nRewrite indexing:\n\nP(m) = (1/m) * sum_{j=1}^{m/5} P(m - 5j)\n\nNote that m-5j is also a multiple of 5 by construction.\n\nWe have base case P(0) =1.\n\nWe want to find P(2015).\n\nLet’s define a sequence Q(n) = P(5n), for n from 0 to 403.\n\nQ(0) = P(0)=1.\n\nThen,\n\nFor n≥1,\n\nP(5n) = (1/(5n)) * sum_{j=1}^{n} P(5n - 5j) = (1/(5n)) * sum_{j=1}^{n} P(5(n-j)) = (1/(5n)) * sum_{i=0}^{n-1} P(5i) = (1/(5n)) * sum_{i=0}^{n-1} Q(i)\n\nTherefore,\n\nQ(n) = (1/(5n)) * S(n-1), where S(k) = sum_{i=0}^k Q(i).\n\nFrom this, we have:\n\nQ(n) = S(n-1)/(5n)\n\nand also\n\nS(n) = S(n-1) + Q(n)\n\nSubstitute Q(n) into S(n):\n\nS(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-1)/(5n) = S(n-1)*(1 + 1/(5n)) = S(n-1)*(1 + 1/(5n)) = S(n-1)*( (5n +1) / (5n) )\n\nSince S(0) = Q(0) = P(0) =1\n\nWe have:\n\nS(0) = 1\n\nS(1) = S(0) * ( (5*1 +1)/ (5*1) ) = 1 * (6/5) = 6/5\n\nS(2) = S(1) * ( (5*2 +1) / (5*2) ) = (6/5) * (11/10) = (6*11)/(5*10) = 66/50 = 33/25\n\nS(3) = S(2) * ( (5*3+1) / (5*3) ) = (33/25) * (16/15) = (33*16)/(25*15) = 528 / 375\n\nS(4) = S(3) * ( (5*4+1)/(5*4) ) = (528/375) * (21/20) = (528*21) / (375*20) = 11088 / 7500 = simplify\n\nBut instead of computing all explicitly, we can write a formula for S(n):\n\nS(n) = ∏_{k=1}^n ( (5k + 1) / (5k) )\n\nBecause\n\nS(n) = S(n-1)*( (5n+1)/(5n) ) starting from S(0) =1\n\nSo\n\nS(n) = ∏_{k=1}^n ( (5k + 1)/(5k) ) = ∏_{k=1}^n (1 + 1/(5k)).\n\nThen,\n\nQ(n) = S(n-1) / (5n)\n\nWe want Q(403) = P(2015).\n\nSo P(2015) = Q(403) = S(402)/(5*403)\n\nTherefore,\n\np = P(2015) = (1/(5*403)) * ∏_{k=1}^{402} ( (5k + 1)/(5k) )\n\nRewrite the product:\n\n∏_{k=1}^{402} ( (5k + 1)/(5k) ) = ∏_{k=1}^{402} ( (5k + 1)/5k ) = ∏_{k=1}^{402} ( (5k + 1)/5k ) = (∏_{k=1}^{402} (5k+1)) / (∏_{k=1}^{402} (5k))\n\n∏_{k=1}^{402} (5k) = 5^{402} * 402!\n\nSo:\n\np = (1/(5*403)) * ( ∏_{k=1}^{402} (5k+1) ) / (5^{402} * 402!)\n\n= (1/(5 * 403)) * ( ∏_{k=1}^{402} (5k +1) ) / (5^{402} * 402!)\n\n= (1/(5^{403} * 403)) * ( ∏_{k=1}^{402} (5k +1) ) / 402!\n\nNow we consider ∏_{k=1}^{402} (5k + 1).\n\nThis is ∏_{k=1}^{402} (5k +1).\n\nNote that 5k +1 runs over 6, 11, 16, ..., 5*402 +1 = 2010 + 1 = 2011.\n\nSo the product is:\n\n6 * 11 * 16 * ... * 2011\n\nThere are 402 terms.\n\nWe want to express ∏_{k=1}^{402} (5k + 1) in terms of factorials or something manageable.\n\nUse the Gamma function or Pochhammer symbol.\n\nRewrite:\n\n∏_{k=1}^{n} (5k + 1) = 5^{n} * ∏_{k=1}^n (k + 1/5)\n\nSo:\n\n∏_{k=1}^{402} (5k +1) = 5^{402} * ∏_{k=1}^{402} (k + 1/5) = 5^{402} * [ (402 + 1/5 -1)! / (1/5 -1)! ] = 5^{402} * (Γ(402 + 1 + 1/5) / Γ(1 + 1/5))\n\nBut in product form:\n\n∏_{k=0}^{n-1} (k + a) = Γ(n + a) / Γ(a)\n\nSo ∏_{k=1}^{n} (k + a -1) = ∏_{k=0}^{n-1} (k + a) = Γ(n + a) / Γ(a)\n\nHere, a = 1 + 1/5 = 6/5\n\nBut our product is ∏_{k=1}^{402} (k + 1/5) = ∏_{k=0}^{401} (k + 1 + 1/5) = ∏_{k=0}^{401} (k + 6/5)\n\nSo:\n\n∏_{k=1}^{402} (k + 1/5) = Γ(402 + 6/5) / Γ(6/5) = Γ(403 + 1/5) / Γ(6/5)\n\nSimilarly, normal factorial:\n\n402! = Γ(403)\n\nSo now,\n\np = (1/(5^{403} * 403)) * (5^{402} * Γ(403 + 1/5) / Γ(6/5)) / 402!\n\n= (1/(5^{403} * 403)) * 5^{402} * Γ(403 + 1/5) / (Γ(6/5) * 402!)\n\n= (1/(5 * 403)) * (Γ(403 + 1/5) / (Γ(6/5) * 402!))\n\nNote that 403 * 402! = 403!\n\nSo (1/403) / 402! = 1 / 403!\n\nSo,\n\np = (1/5) * (Γ(403 + 1/5) / (Γ(6/5) * 403!))\n\nThis expression is complicated but exact.\n\nWithout Gamma functions, return to product form:\n\np = (1/(5*403)) * ∏_{k=1}^{402} ((5k + 1)/(5k))\n\n= (1/(5*403)) * ∏_{k=1}^{402} (1 + 1/(5k))\n\nFrom before, the recursive definition:\n\nS(n) = ∏_{k=1}^n ( (5k +1)/(5k)) = ∏_{k=1}^n (1 + 1/(5k))\n\nBecause p = Q(403) = S(402)/(5*403)\n\nObservation: the factors (5k+1) and 5k are co-prime with 5-31 prime factors?\n\nNow, the problem says p = 5^a * 31^b * (c/d), with c and d co-prime to 5 and 31.\n\nTherefore, the power of 5 in p is coming from denominator and numerator.\n\nLet's find the net exponent of 5.\n\nLooking at the denominator, we have a factor 5 in (5*403) = 5*403.\n\nSimilarly, in the product ∏_{k=1}^{402} (5k+1)/(5k), denominator is 5^{402} * 402!.\n\nSo total powers of 5 in denominator = 5^{402+1} = 5^{403}.\n\nIn numerator, product of (5k +1). Since (5k+1) are numbers congruent to 1 mod 5, they are not divisible by 5, so numerator has no factors of 5.\n\nThus, total power of 5 in p is:\n\n- numerator no factor\n\n- denominator factor: 5^{403}\n\nBut in front we have 1/(403), which is co-prime with 5.\n\nSo overall p has factor of 5^{-403}.\n\nTherefore, a = -403.\n\nSimilarly, for 31:\n\nCheck if numerator or denominator have factors of 31.\n\nDenominator includes 403! — which numbers between 1 and 403 have factors of 31?\n\n31 is prime.\n\nCount multiples of 31 up to 403:\n\nfloor(403/31) = 13\n\nSo 13 multiples.\n\nAlso multiples of 31^2 = 31^2=961 > 403, so only one level.\n\nSo total power of 31 in 403! is 13.\n\nDenominator has 31^{13} factor from 403!.\n\nDoes numerator have any factor of 31?\n\nNumerator is ∏_{k=1}^{402} (5k +1) = numbers of the form 5k +1 for k=1..402.\n\nCheck when 5k+1 divisible by 31:\n\nSolve 5k + 1 ≡ 0 mod 31\n\n=> 5k ≡ -1 ≡ 30 mod 31\n\n=> k ≡ 30 * 5^{-1} mod 31\n\nFind inverse of 5 mod 31:\n\n5*? ≡ 1 mod 31\n\nTry multiples:\n\n5*6=30 (not 1)\n\n5*25=125 ≡ 125 - 4*31=125 - 124=1, so inverse is 25.\n\nSo k ≡ 30 * 25 mod 31\n\n30 * 25=750\n\n750 mod 31:\n\n31*24=744 remainder 6.\n\nSo k ≡ 6 mod 31.\n\nSo values of k is k=6 (mod 31), with k=1..402.\n\nNow count how many such k in [1,402]:\n\nNumber of integers k ≤ 402 with k ≡ 6 mod 31 is\n\nFirst k=6,\n\nLast k ≈ 6 + 31 * t ≤ 402\n\nt_max = floor((402-6)/31) = floor(396/31) = 12\n\nSo count = 12 +1 = 13 values.\n\nSo numerator has 13 factors divisible by 31.\n\nEach (5k +1) divisible by 31 once (since 31 is prime and 5k+1 is linear, no squares).\n\nSo numerator has factor 31^{13}\n\nTherefore numerator factor for 31 is 31^{13}\n\nDenominator factor for 31 is 31^{13}\n\nFrom 403! denominator.\n\nNo other 31 in denominator (since 5*403 is 5*403, 403=13*31)\n\nBut 403 = 13 * 31\n\nSo denominator has factor 31^1 in 403.\n\nSo total factor in denominator for 31 is 31^{13} from 403! and 31 from 403:\n\nTotal 31^{14} in denominator.\n\nTherefore total net factor for 31 is numerator 31^{13} / denominator 31^{14} = 31^{-1}\n\nSo b = -1.\n\nSummary:\n\na = -403\n\nb = -1\n\nTherefore a + b = -403 - 1 = -404\n\nProblem 1 answer: -404\n\n---\n\nProblem 2:\n\nSolve the system:\n\nx + y + z = 3\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3\n\nFind all roots x,y,z (real or complex).\n\n---\n\nFrom algebraic identities:\n\nFirst, we recall the identity:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\n\nGiven:\n\nx + y + z = 3\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3\n\nCompute:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 -3xyz = ?\n\nGiven values, so:\n\n3 - 3xyz = (3)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\n\nTherefore,\n\n3 -3xyz = 3(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 - xyz = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx\n\nRecall also:\n\n(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)\n\nGiven x + y + z =3 ⇒ 9 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)\n\nTherefore,\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 - 2(xy + yz + zx)\n\nPlug into previous:\n\n1 - xyz = [9 - 2(xy + yz + zx)] - (xy + yz + zx) = 9 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\n\nTherefore:\n\n1 - xyz = 9 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\n\nRearranged:\n\n3(xy + yz + zx) = 8 + xyz\n\n---(A)\n\nWe want to find all triples (x,y,z) such that x + y + z =3 and x^3 + y^3 + z^3 =3.\n\nIdea:\n\nTry symmetric form:\n\nLet S1 = x + y + z =3\n\nS2 = xy + yz + zx\n\nS3= xyz\n\nWe want solutions for S1=3 and that satisfy (A).\n\nFrom symmetric sums, and the cubic polynomial with roots x,y,z is:\n\nt^3 - S1 t^2 + S2 t - S3 =0\n\nSo polynomial:\n\nt^3 -3 t^2 + S2 t - S3 =0\n\n---\n\nUsing identity (A):\n\n3 S2 = 8 + S3\n\nor\n\nS3 = 3 S2 -8\n\nSo, rewrite S3 in terms of S2.\n\nThus,\n\nThe polynomial becomes\n\nt^3 - 3 t^2 + S2 t - (3 S2 - 8) = 0\n\nt^3 -3 t^2 + S2 t -3 S2 + 8 = 0\n\n---\n\nTry to find values for S2 which give roots.\n\nNote that if all three roots are equal, then x = y = z = r.\n\nFrom x + y + z=3, 3r=3 ⇒ r=1.\n\nDoes it satisfy x^3 + y^3 + z^3 =3 ?\n\n3 * 1^3 =3 yes.\n\nTherefore, (1,1,1) is a solution.\n\nCheck further.\n\nSo (1,1,1) is solution.\n\n---\n\nFind other solutions.\n\nTry to find roots with two variables equal.\n\nAssume y = z.\n\nThen from x + 2 y=3 → x = 3 - 2 y\n\nAlso x^3 + 2 y^3 =3.\n\nLet’s express in y:\n\nx = 3 - 2 y\n\nThen:\n\n(3 - 2y)^3 + 2 y^3 =3\n\nExpand (3 - 2y)^3:\n\n= 27 - 54 y + 36 y^2 - 8 y^3 + 2 y^3 = 3\n\nNotice: (3 - 2 y)^3 + 2 y^3 = 27 -54 y +36 y^2 -8 y^3 + 2 y^3 = 27 -54 y +36 y^2 - 6 y^3\n\nSet equal to 3:\n\n27 -54 y +36 y^2 - 6 y^3 =3\n\nSubtract 3:\n\n24 -54 y +36 y^2 - 6 y^3 =0\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n4 - 9 y + 6 y^2 - y^3 =0\n\nRewrite:\n\n-y^3 + 6 y^2 - 9 y + 4 =0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\ny^3 - 6 y^2 + 9 y -4 =0\n\nTry to factor:\n\nTry roots of this cubic y^3 - 6 y^2 + 9 y -4 = 0\n\nCheck rational roots candidates: factors of 4 = ±1, ±2, ±4\n\nTry y=1:\n\n1 -6 + 9 -4 =0 → 0, y=1 is root.\n\nDivide polynomial by (y-1):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1, -6, 9, -4\n\nBring down 1\n\nMultiply by 1:1\n\nAdd: -6 +1 = -5\n\nMultiply by 1: -5\n\nAdd: 9 -5 =4\n\nMultiply by 1:4\n\nAdd: -4 +4 =0\n\nQuotient polynomial: y^2 -5 y +4\n\nSet y^2 -5 y +4=0\n\nQuadratic formula:\n\ny = [5 ± sqrt(25 -16)] /2 = (5 ±3)/2\n\nSo y= (5+3)/2=8/2=4 or y= (5-3)/2=2/2=1\n\nSo roots of cubic:\n\ny=1, y=1, y=4\n\nMultiplicity root 1 repeated?

For n multiple of 5, P(n) satisfies the recursion P(n) = (1/n) * sum of P(n-k) over k divisible by 5 (1 ≤ k ≤ n). Defining Q(n) = P(5n), the recursion leads to Q(n) = S(n-1)/(5n), where S(n) = product over k=1 to n of (5k + 1)/(5k).

Therefore, a = -403, b = -1, and a+b = -404.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using symmetric sums, let S1=x+y+z=3, S2=xy+yz+zx, S3=xyz. Using the identity x^3+y^3+z^3 -3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2+y^2+z^2 - xy - yz - zx), we derive 3S2=8+S3. The cubic polynomial with roots x,y,z is t^3 -3 t^2 + S2 t - S3=0, rewriting into t^3 -3 t^2 + S2 t - (3 S2 -8)=0. Testing, the solutions are the permutations of (1,1,1) and (4,4,-5), which satisfy both equations.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"-404\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"(1,1,1); (4,4,-5) including all permutations\"\n}",
