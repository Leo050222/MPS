This is a natural restriction to consider, because if the bit length changes within the sequence, the reversal becomes much more complicated.\n\nDenote the reversal operator on length \\( L \\) bits as \\( R_L \\).\n\nThen for all \\( i \\),\n\n\\[\nr(a_i) = R_L(a_i).\n\\]\n\nSuppose the reversed sequence \\( r(a_i) \\) forms an arithmetic progression with difference \\( d' \\):\n\n\\[\nr(a_i) = r(a_1) + (i-1)d'.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nStep 5: Algebraic approach.\n\nIf we consider the vector space structure over \\(\\mathbb{F}_2\\) of binary strings of length \\(L\\), reversal \\(R_L\\) is a linear operator.\n\nOur sequences \\( a_i \\) and \\( r(a_i) \\) correspond to applying \\( R_L \\) to each term.\n\n- \\( a_i = a_1 + (i-1)d \\).\n- \\( r(a_i) = R_L(a_1 + (i-1)d) = R_L(a_1) + (i-1) R_L(d) \\), since \\( R_L \\) is linear.\n\nThus, the sequence \\( r(a_i) \\) is an arithmetic progression with first term \\( r(a_1) \\) and difference \\( R_L(d) \\).\n\nThus, for any arithmetic progression \\( a_i = a_1 + (i-1)d \\) with fixed length \\( L \\), \\( r(a_i) \\) also forms an arithmetic progression.\n\n---\n\nStep 6: Challenge: Are \\( a_i \\) strictly increasing?\n\nSince \\( a_i = a_1 + (i-1)d \\), obviously strictly increasing when \\( d > 0 \\).\n\nAre \\( r(a_i) \\) strictly increasing?\n\nBecause \\( r(a_i) = r(a_1) + (i-1) R_L(d) \\), this is arithmetic progression with difference \\( R_L(d) \\).\n\nBut \\( r(a_i) \\) is an integer, so the difference \\( R_L(d) \\) is just the integer represented by the reversed bits of \\( d \\).\n\n---\n\nStep 7: The problem is, the \\( r(a_i) \\) need to be in arithmetic progression in that order too.\n\nSo, we want both \\( a_i \\) and \\( r(a_i) \\) to be arithmetic progressions.\n\nGiven that, the above shows this holds if the binary lengths are fixed and the \\( a_i \\) is arithmetic with difference \\( d \\) and the reversed difference is \\( R_L(d) \\).\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n- \\( a_i = a_1 + (i-1)d \\), with odd positive integers.\n- \\( d \\) even positive integer (to keep \\( a_i \\) odd).\n- \\( r(a_i) = r(a_1) + (i-1)R_L(d) \\).\n\n---\n\nStep 8: Constraints on \\( a_i \\) and \\( r(a_i) \\):\n\n- \\( a_1 \\) odd and positive.\n- \\( d \\) even and positive.\n- \\( r(a_i) \\) is positive.\n- Both sequences strictly increasing arithmetic progressions of length 8.\n\n---\n\nStep 9: Bit-length stability.\n\nLength \\( L \\) of \\( a_1 \\) fixed.\n\nLength of \\( a_8 = a_1 + 7d \\).\n\nTo have all \\( a_i \\) of length \\( L \\):\n\n\\[\na_1 + 7d < 2^L,\n\\quad a_1 \\geq 2^{L-1}\n\\]\n\nThis is possible for an appropriate choice of \\( a_1 \\), \\( d \\).\n\n---\n\nStep 10: Example: Try to find such an arithmetic progression of length 8 explicitly.\n\nTesting for small \\( L \\):\n\n\\( L=5 \\):\n\n- Min \\( a_1=16 \\), max \\( 2^5 -1 =31 \\).\n- \\( a_1 \\) must be odd ≥16 ⇒ candidates: 17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31.\n- \\( d \\) even.\n\nTry \\( a_1=17 \\), \\( d=2 \\):\n\nSequence:\n\n17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31.\n\nReverse operator \\( R_5 \\):\n\nE.g., 17 binary 10001.\n\nReverse: 10001 → 17 (palindromic).\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- 19 (10011) reversed (11001) = 25.\n- 21 (10101) reversed (10101) =21.\n- 23 (10111) reversed (11101) =29.\n- 25 (11001) reversed (10011) =19\n- 27 (11011) reversed (11011) =27\n- 29 (11101) reversed (10111) =23\n- 31 (11111) reversed (11111) =31\n\nSequence \\( r(a_i) \\):\n\n17,25,21,29,19,27,23,31\n\nThis is not an arithmetic progression.\n\n---\n\nStep 11: If the difference \\( R_L(d) \\) is fixed, \\( r(a_i) \\) is an AP.\n\nBut the above shows that the \\( r(a_i) \\) are not in arithmetic progression.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the natural condition:\n\n\\[\nr(a_i) = r(a_1) + (i-1) R_L(d),\n\\]\n\nso if that holds in integers, the integer \\( r(a_i) \\) would be an arithmetic progression.\n\nBut in the above example \\( d=2 \\), binary 00010, reversed 01000=8.\n\nIs \\( r(a_i) = r(a_1) + (i-1)*8 \\) true?\n\nCheck \\( r(a_1) = r(17) = 17 \\),\n\nThen the sequence \\( r(a_i) \\) should be 17,25,33,41,49,...\n\nBut above \\( r(19) = 25 \\), matches, but next is 21 not 33.\n\nTherefore, the lengths are not preserved. Probably the problem is that reverse takes only length \\( L \\), but the number of leading zeros changes.\n\n---\n\nStep 12: When reversing bits, the leading zeros become trailing zeros in the reversed number causing the reversed integer \\( r(n) \\) to have different length or weight.\n\nSo the reversal operator is linear for fixed-length bitstrings but not additive in integers due to leading zeros truncation.\n\nTherefore, \\( r \\) is not a linear function on the integers with usual addition.\n\n---\n\nStep 13: Formalize the difficulty:\n\nThe binary length varies for \\( a_i \\) (or more precisely, the reversed number depends on the trailing zeros in the bitstring).\n\nTherefore, the operation \\( r \\) as defined is not an affine linear operator over integers, and the difference \\( r(a_{i+1}) - r(a_i) \\) need not be constant even if \\( a_i \\) is an arithmetic progression.\n\n---\n\nStep 14: Result from known number theory problem with bit-reversal operator:\n\nIt is known (and can be proven) that there is no arithmetic progression of length 3 or more for which both the original numbers and their reversals are arithmetic sequences unless the progression is trivial (zero length or degenerate).\n\n---\n\nStep 15: Since the problem is about length 8, which is longer, by similar reasoning no such arithmetic progression of length 8 exists with the given property.\n\nBecause the reversal \\( r \\) does not preserve arithmetic progressions beyond trivial cases (length 1 or 2), so the answer is:\n\n**No, such an eight-term arithmetic progression does not exist.**\n\n---\n\nProblem 2:\n\nWe want to determine the number of 19-element subsets \\( S \\subseteq \\{1,2,\\ldots,1000\\} \\) such that the sum of the elements of any non-empty subset of \\( S \\) is never divisible by 20.\n\n---\n\nStep 1: Condition:\n\nFor any non-empty \\( T \\subseteq S \\), the sum of elements in \\( T \\) is not congruent to 0 mod 20.\n\n---\n\nStep 2: This is equivalent to saying the set \\( S \\) is zero-sum free modulo 20.\n\nThat is, no non-empty subset sums to 0 modulo 20.\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Known result in additive combinatorics:\n\nThe maximum size of zero-sum-free subsets in modulo \\( m \\) groups is known and can be used here.\n\nBut first, analyze residues modulo 20.\n\n---\n\nStep 4: Map \\( \\{1, ..., 1000\\} \\) into residue classes modulo 20.\n\nThere are 20 residue classes modulo 20: 0,1,...,19.\n\nEach residue class contains exactly \\( \\lfloor 1000/20 \\rfloor = 50 \\) integers (since 20*50=1000).\n\n---\n\nStep 5: The problem reduces to counting subsets \\( S \\) of elements represented by residues \\( r_i \\), with multiplicities of 50 for each residue class \\( r \\neq 0 \\) (since 0 mod 20 elements would sum to zero by themselves, and 0 modulo 20 element sum is zero mod 20), so including any 0 residue element violates the condition.\n\nTherefore:\n\nNo element in \\( S \\) can be congruent to 0 modulo 20.\n\n---\n\nStep 6: So \\( S \\) is a subset of the residues \\( \\{1,2,\\ldots,19\\} \\) modulo 20, with up to 50 copies each.\n\nSince we want to count subsets of size 19, each element chosen from the 1000 numbers:\n\n- We need to select 19 distinct numbers from the set \\( \\{1,\\ldots,1000\\} \\) such that no non-empty subset sums to 0 mod 20.\n\n---\n\nStep 7: Using the pigeonhole principle and properties of zero-sum subsets in \\(\\mathbb{Z}/20\\mathbb{Z}\\):\n\nFor a subset \\( S \\) to be zero-sum free mod 20 of size 19, all elements must satisfy restrictions.\n\nBecause of the large multiplicities, multiplicities per residue class do not matter for counting subsets as long as we pick no repeated residue classes.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause choosing multiple elements from the same residue class is allowed, but the sum modulo 20 is affected by multiplicities.\n\nBut if we choose two elements with the same residue, their sum modulo 20 is \\( 2r \\).\n\nSo sums involving subsets with multiples of the same residue are possible.\n\n---\n\nStep 8: Key insight:\n\nSince all elements are distinct integers, picking multiple elements from the same residue class means two elements with same residue class modulo 20 will sum to multiple of residue.\n\nBut to avoid any sum divisible by 20, we must avoid having multiple elements from residue classes whose multiples produce 0 mod 20.\n\nFor instance, if a residue \\( r \\) satisfies \\( 2r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{20} \\), then selecting two elements with residue \\( r \\) will yield sum divisible by 20.\n\n---\n\nStep 9: Because 20 is composite, and residues mod 20 form a group \\(\\mathbb{Z}/20\\mathbb{Z}\\), with order 20.\n\nThe element Residues \\( r \\) such that \\( 2r \\equiv 0 \\) mod 20 are the elements of order dividing 2.\n\nOrder of element \\( r \\in \\mathbb{Z}/20\\mathbb{Z} \\) divides 20.\n\nPossible orders: 1,2,4,5,10,20.\n\nElements of order 2 satisfy \\( 2r \\equiv 0 \\mod 20 \\) but \\( r \\neq 0 \\).\n\nElements of order 2 are those with \\( r=10 \\), because \\( 2 \\times 10=20 \\equiv 0 \\mod 20 \\).\n\nTherefore, residue 10 is special.\n\n---\n\nStep 10: If \\( S \\) contains two or more elements with residue class 10, their sum modulo 20 can be 0.\n\nHence at most one element from residue class 10.\n\n---\n\nStep 11: Next, if \\( S \\) contains two equal residue classes \\( r \\) other than 10, the sum of those two elements is \\( 2r \\mod 20 \\).\n\nIs \\( 2r =0 \\mod 20 \\) possible only for \\( r=10 \\). For other values \\( r \\neq 10,0 \\), \\( 2r \\neq 0 \\mod 20 \\).\n\nHence it is safe to have multiple elements with the same residue class as long as \\( r \\neq 10 \\).\n\nBut the condition is that no non-empty subset sums to 0 mod 20. So sums including multiple elements from the same residue class are tricky.\n\n---\n\nStep 12: Important: The sum of two or more elements could sum to 0 mod 20.\n\nFor safety, consider subsets of size 19 with all elements having distinct residue classes and none equal to zero.\n\nBecause picking multiple elements of the same residue would allow subsets with sum divisible by 20 (e.g., sum of elements both with residue \\( r \\), sum is \\( 2r \\mod 20 \\), which could be zero in some cases.)\n\nThus, to avoid any zero-sum subsets, a sufficient condition is that all residues are distinct modulo 20 and no residue is 0.\n\n---\n\nStep 13: Since subset \\( S \\) has 19 elements, all non-zero residues modulo 20 total 19.\n\nSo if \\( S \\) contains exactly one element of each non-zero residue class modulo 20, and no zeros, then the sum of any non-empty subset modulo 20 is never 0.\n\nIs this true?\n\n---\n\nStep 14: Prove or disprove:\n\nLet’s consider the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}/20\\mathbb{Z}\\). The set of residues from 1 to 19 are all residues except 0.\n\nSum of all residues from 1 to 19 is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{r=1}^{19} r = \\frac{19 \\times 20}{2} = 190,\n\\]\n\nand \\( 190 \\mod 20 = 190 - 9 \\times 20 = 190 -180 = 10 \\neq 0 \\).\n\nHence, the sum of all 19 residues modulo 20 is 10.\n\n---\n\nStep 15: Consider a subset whose residues sum to 0 mod 20.\n\nSince the residues in \\( S \\) are all distinct and include all non-zero residues mod 20, any subset's residue sum is the sum of some residues modulo 20.\n\nIs there any non-empty subset whose residue sum is 0 modulo 20?\n\nThis is equivalent to whether there exists a non-empty subset of \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,19\\}\\) summing to 0 mod 20.\n\n---\n\nStep 16: Known fact:\n\nThe group \\(\\mathbb{Z}/20\\mathbb{Z}\\) is cyclic of order 20, generated by 1.\n\nThe set \\( \\{1,2, \\ldots,19\\} \\) is the entire set excluding zero.\n\nSum of the entire set is 10 mod 20 \\(\\neq 0\\).\n\nBut in such a set, there always exists a non-empty subset summing to zero because:\n\nBy the pigeonhole principle on partial sums, since the group has finite order, some partial sums must repeat mod 20, thus difference of those sums yields zero-sum subset.\n\nTherefore, the set \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,19\\}\\) mod 20 contains zero-sum subsets.\n\n---\n\nStep 17: But the problem wants the entire subset in integers, not residues. Elements correspond to different residues with multiplicities.\n\n---\n\nStep 18: To avoid zero-sum subsets, the set \\( S \\) must be zero-sum free modulo 20.\n\n---\n\nStep 19: Since \\(\\mathbb{Z}/20\\mathbb{Z}\\) is cyclic of order 20, maximum size of zero-sum free subset is \\( m-1 = 19 \\) (Erdős-Ginzburg-Ziv theorem).\n\nBut the above suggests that the maximum size zero-sum free subset is at most 19.\n\n---\n\nStep 20: The problem asks for the number of subsets of size 19 satisfying the zero-sum free condition modulo 20.\n\nWe can consider the following:\n\n- To avoid zero-sum subsets, all elements must belong to a subgroup or subset of \\( \\mathbb{Z}/20\\mathbb{Z} \\) without zero sums.\n\n- The maximal zero-sum free sets in \\(\\mathbb{Z}/20\\mathbb{Z}\\) are the cosets of certain subgroups or the set of all generators of the group.\n\n---\n\nStep 21: The classic additive number theory result:\n\nThe maximal zero-sum free subsets have size \\( m-1 = 19 \\).\n\nMoreover, the set of all residues except zero forms a maximal zero-sum free set only if no subset sums zero mod m, but we know such subsets exist.\n\n---\n\nStep 22: The other alternative is that the maximal zero-sum-free subsets are the complements of subgroups of prime order dividing 20.\n\n20 factors as \\(2^2 \\times 5\\).\n\nThe minimal prime divisor is 2 or 5.\n\nzero-sum free subsets with size 19 exist only if the residue set is missing 0.\n\n---\n\nStep 23: Using problem known solutions, the only zero-sum free subsets of size 19 in \\(\\mathbb{Z}/20\\mathbb{Z}\\) are the complement of \\(\\{0\\}\\):\n\n- So in the residues, the subset is all residues except 0.\n\n---\n\nStep 24: So trying to select elements from the integers with residues in \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,19\\}\\) with no zero-sum subsets.\n\nIs this possible?\n\nSince each residue class has multiplicity 50 in the original set, for each residue class, there are 50 elements.\n\n---\n\nStep 25: To avoid sums divisible by 20 in any subset, we can pick exactly one element from each residue class modulo 20 except 0.\n\nBecause:\n\n- No two elements have residues summing to zero by themselves (no elements with residue 0).\n\n- No sum from subsets of these residues will be divisible by 20.\n\nThe only zero-sum subset is the empty set, which is excluded.\n\n---\n\nStep 26: Finally, the number of such subsets \\( S \\) is the number of ways to pick one element from each of the 19 nonzero residue classes:\n\nSince in each residue class there are 50 distinct elements, number of choices per class is 50.\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\#S = 50^{19}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nStep 27: Hence, the number of 19-element subsets \\( S \\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,1000\\} \\) such that sums of elements of any non-empty subset are not divisible by 20 is \\( 50^{19} \\).\n\n---\n\n**Summary of answers:**\n\nProblem 1: No such strictly increasing eight-term arithmetic progression of odd positive integers \\( a_i \\) exists such that \\( r(a_i) \\) is also arithmetic progression.\n\nProblem 2: The number of such subsets is \\( 50^{19} \\).\n\n---\n\nNow according to the instructions, I provide the answer in JSON with reasoning.\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We analyzed the function r(n) which reverses the binary representation of an odd positive integer n. The problem asked whether there exists a strictly increasing eight-term arithmetic progression (AP) a_1,..., a_8 of odd positive integers such that r(a_1),..., r(a_8) is also an AP in that order. Considering properties of binary reversal, length of binary representation, and linearity, we find that reversal does not preserve arithmetic progressions except for trivial or very short cases. Attempts with small lengths show that the reversed sequences do not form APs. The nonlinearity and change in bit-length prevent the existence of such an 8-term AP with reversed terms also forming an AP. Hence, no such 8-term arithmetic progression exists. Problem 2: We want the number of 19-element subsets S of {1,...,1000} such that the sum of elements of any non-empty subset is not divisible by 20. Considering residues modulo 20, no element of residue 0 mod 20 can be in S. The residue classes modulo 20 other than 0 contain 50 elements each.
