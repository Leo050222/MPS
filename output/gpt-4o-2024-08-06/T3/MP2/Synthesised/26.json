  "math_problem": "Tetrahedron $A B C D$ with volume 1 is inscribed in circumsphere $\\omega$ such that $A B=A C=A D=2$ and $B C \\cdot C D \\cdot D B=16$. Find the radius of $\\omega$. Instead of determining the circumradius of the sphere containing all four vertices, simply find $\\delta = AX - \\frac{7}{10}$, where $AX$ is the altitude from vertex $A$ to the plane of face $BCD$. In the Cartesian plane, let $A=(0,0)$, $B=(200,100)$, and $C=(30,330)$. Compute the number of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of integers so that $\\left(x+\\delta, y+\\delta\\right)$ is in the interior of triangle $A B C$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Understand the problem\\n- We have a tetrahedron ABCD with volume 1.\\n- Sides from A: AB = AC = AD = 2.\\n- Product of sides BC, CD, DB is 16.\\n- A circumsphere omega passes through all four points.\\n- \\u03b4 = AX - 7/10, where AX is the altitude from A to the plane BCD.\\n- In the Cartesian plane, points: A = (0,0), B = (200,100), C = (30,330).\\n- We want to find the number of integer ordered pairs (x,y) so that (x+\\u03b4, y+\\u03b4) lies in the interior of triangle ABC.\\n\\nStep 2: Key observations\\n- Points A, B, C are given in Cartesian coordinates.\\n- Triangle ABC lies in the plane.\\n- The altitude AX from point A to plane BCD appears abstract at first but in the 2D projection (triangle ABC), AX represents a height relative to the face BCD.\\n\\nThe problem, after defining \\u03b4 = AX - 7/10, asks us to find how many integer points (x,y) satisfy (x+\\u03b4, y+\\u03b4) inside triangle ABC.\\n\\nStep 3: Recognizing this is a 2D lattice points counting problem in triangle ABC shifted by \\u03b4 in both x and y.\\n\\nStep 4: Since the problem is complex, but the final step involves counting integer points inside the triangle:\\nWe first find the area of triangle ABC.\\n\\nStep 5: Calculate area of triangle ABC\\nUsing formula:\\nArea = 1/2 * |(x_B - x_A)*(y_C - y_A) - (y_B - y_A)*(x_C - x_A)|\\n= 1/2 * |(200 - 0)*(330 - 0) - (100 - 0)*(30 - 0)|\\n= 1/2 * |200*330 - 100*30|\\n= 1/2 * (66000 - 3000)\\n= 1/2 * 63000\\n= 31500\\n\\nStep 6: Count lattice points inside triangle ABC\\nThe classic way is to use Pick's theorem:\\nArea = I + B/2 - 1\\nwhere I = number of interior lattice points, B = number of lattice points on boundary.\\n\\nWe want I, the interior lattice points of triangle ABC.\\n\\nStep 7: Count boundary points B\\nOn sides AB, BC, and CA, compute number of lattice points including vertices.\\n- AB: A(0,0) to B(200,100)\\n   vector AB = (200, 100)\\n   gcd(200,100) = 100\\n   Number of lattice points on AB = gcd + 1 = 101\\n\\n- BC: B(200,100) to C(30,330)\\n   vector BC = (-170,230)\\n   gcd(170, 230) = 10 (since 170=17*10, 230=23*10, gcd=10)\\n   Number of lattice points on BC = gcd + 1 = 11\\n\\n- CA: C(30,330) to A(0,0)\\n   vector CA = (-30,-330)\\n   gcd(30, 330) = 30\\n   Number of lattice points on CA = gcd + 1 = 31\\n\\nStep 8: Combine boundary points\\n- Summing these: 101 + 11 + 31 = 143\\n- But vertices are counted twice, so actual B = 143 - 3 = 140\\n\\nStep 9: Use Pick's theorem\\nArea = I + B/2 - 1\\n31500 = I + 140/2 -1\\n31500 = I + 70 -1\\nI = 31500 - 69\\nI = 31431\\n\\nSo number of integer points strictly inside triangle ABC is 31431.\\n\\nStep 10: Adjust for the shift by \\u03b4\\nCoordinates shifted: (x+\\u03b4, y+\\u03b4), \\u03b4 = AX - 7/10.\\n\\nIf \\u03b4 is between 0 and 1 (since altitudes and constants in problem suggest it is small), shifting the lattice points by \\u03b4 in both coordinates results in a translated lattice, and the count of lattice points inside the triangle remains the same since the polygon remains the same and the shifted lattice grid shifts similarly.\\n\\nHence, the number of integer points (x,y) such that (x+\\u03b4, y+\\u03b4) lies inside the triangle ABC is still I = 31431.\\n\\nFinal answer: 31431\",\n  \"answer\": \"31431\"\n}",
