FemtoPravis is walking on an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard that wraps around at its edges (so squares on the left edge of the chessboard are adjacent to squares on the right edge, and similarly for the top and bottom edges). Each femtosecond, FemtoPravis moves in one of the four diagonal directions uniformly at random. After $n$ femtoseconds, what is the probability that FemtoPravis is at his original location?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, we analyze the given equation:\\n\\n(p / q) - (4 / (r + 1)) = 1\\n\\nHere, p, q, r are prime numbers, and we want to find n = r + 2009.\\n\\nStep 1: Rearrange the equation:\\n\\np / q = 1 + 4 / (r + 1) = (r + 1 + 4) / (r + 1) = (r + 5) / (r + 1)\\n\\nSo:\\n\\np / q = (r + 5) / (r + 1)\\n\\nSince p and q are primes, p/q is a reduced fraction with prime numerator and denominator.\\n\\nStep 2: Consider the fraction (r + 5)/(r + 1). We want this fraction in lowest terms to be p/q with p, q primes.\\n\\nLet’s examine (r + 1) and (r + 5) for various prime values of r.\\n\\nWe seek primes r such that when we simplify (r + 5) / (r + 1), the numerator and denominator are primes.\\n\\nStep 3: Try some small primes for r:\\n- r=2:\\n  r+1=3, r+5=7\\n  Fraction: 7/3\\n  p=7, q=3 (both prime) – valid\\n\\n- r=3:\\n  r+1=4 (not prime)\\n\\n- r=5:\\n  r+1=6 (not prime)\\n\\n- r=7:\\n  r+1=8 (not prime)\\n\\n- r=11:\\n  r+1=12 (not prime)\\n\\n- r=13:\\n  r+1=14 (not prime)\\n\\n- r=17:\\n  r+1=18 (not prime)\\n\\n- r=19:\\n  r+1=20 (not prime)\\n\\n- r=23:\\n  r+1=24 (not prime)\\n\\nAll except r=2 yield a denominator (r+1) that is not prime. But q is supposed to be prime, yet in the fraction p/q = (r + 5)/(r + 1), q = r + 1.\\n\\nFrom the problem, the denominator of the second term is (r + 1), which is equal to the numerator of the subtracted fraction. Apparently, this might be leading us to the idea that q = r + 1.\\n\\nBut r + 1 isn't prime for r > 2.\\n\\nSince only r=2 yields r+1=3 prime, then r=2 is the only solution.\\n\\nThus, r=2.\\n\\nStep 4: Compute n = r + 2009 = 2 + 2009 = 2011.\\n\\nStep 5: Now, find the probability that after n=2011 femtoseconds, FemtoPravis is at his original location on the 8x8 toroidal chessboard.\\n\\nMovement details:\\n- Each step: moves to one of the four diagonal neighbors with equal probability 1/4.\\n  The moves correspond to unit steps in (x,y): (+1,+1), (+1,-1), (-1,+1), (-1,-1).\\n\\nStep 6: After n steps, what is the probability to return to the original position?\\n\\nStep 7: Model coordinates separately (mod 8):\\n\\nAt each step, coordinate changes by either +1 or -1 independently in x and y, but in a coupled way.\\n\\nHowever, since directions are diagonal, at each step:\\n- The x change is +1 or -1 with probability 1/2 each.\\n- Similarly for y.\\n\\nBecause from the four diagonals:\\n- (+1,+1)\\n- (+1,-1)\\n- (-1,+1)\\n- (-1,-1)\\n\\nThe x-step is uniformly +1 or -1 with probability 1/2.\\nSimilarly for y-step.\\n\\nSo the x and y coordinates each perform an independent symmetric random walk mod 8 with steps of ±1 with probability 1/2.\\n\\nStep 8: Probability to be at starting coordinate after n steps in one dimension:\\n\\nSince steps are ±1 with equal probabilities, the position after n steps modulo 8 is determined by sum of n independent ±1 increments mod 8.\\n\\nLet S_n = sum of these ±1 steps modulo 8.\\n\\nProbability that S_n ≡ 0 mod 8 is:\\n\\nP(S_n = 0) = number of sequences with sum ≡ 0 mod 8 / 2^n.\\n\\nStep 9: Due to convolution, the probability distribution mod 8 is the n-th power of the characteristic function of +1/-1 mod 8.\\n\\nUsing discrete Fourier transform:\\n\\nP(S_n = k) = (1/8) * sum_{j=0}^7 [ (cos(2πj/8))^n * e^{-2πi j k/8} ]\\n\\nWe want k=0, so:\\n\\nP(S_n = 0) = (1/8) * sum_{j=0}^7 (cos(2π j /8))^n\\n\\nStep 10: The probability to be at original position after n steps in 2D is the square of probability in one dimension because x and y are independent:\\n\\nP_total = (P(S_n=0))^2 = [ (1/8) * sum_{j=0}^7 (cos(2π j /8))^n ]^2\\n\\nStep 11: Compute explicitly for n=2011.\\n\\ncos(2π j /8) values:\\n- j=0: cos(0) = 1\\n- j=1: cos(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2\\n- j=2: cos(π/2) = 0\\n- j=3: cos(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2\\n- j=4: cos(π) = -1\\n- j=5: cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2\\n- j=6: cos(3π/2) = 0\\n- j=7: cos(7π/4) = sqrt(2)/2\\n\\nNote: (cos θ)^n when n is odd: \\n- (-1)^n = -1\\n- (sqrt(2)/2)^n remains positive\\n\\nCalculate each term:\\n\\n1^2011 = 1\\n(sqrt(2)/2)^2011 = a positive number < 1\\n0^2011 = 0\\n(-sqrt(2)/2)^2011 = -(sqrt(2)/2)^2011 because 2011 is odd\\n(-1)^2011 = -1\\n\\nBecause cos(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 and cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, their powers are negative of the positive (sqrt(2)/2)^2011\\n\\nSimilarly for cos(7π/4) = sqrt(2)/2\\n\\nSum up:\\n\\nSum = 1 + (sqrt(2)/2)^2011 + 0 - (sqrt(2)/2)^2011 -1 - (sqrt(2)/2)^2011 + 0 + (sqrt(2)/2)^2011\\n\\nGroup positives and negatives:\\n\\nPositives: 1 + (sqrt(2)/2)^2011 + (sqrt(2)/2)^2011 = 1 + 2*(sqrt(2)/2)^2011\\nNegatives: - (sqrt(2)/2)^2011 -1\\n\\nTotal sum = 1 -1 + 2*(sqrt(2)/2)^2011 - (sqrt(2)/2)^2011 - (sqrt(2)/2)^2011 = 0\\n\\nBut looking carefully, terms cancel in pairs:\\n\\nPrecisely:\\n\\nj=0: 1\\nj=1: +(sqrt(2)/2)^2011 = a\\nj=2: 0\\nj=3: (-sqrt(2)/2)^2011 = -a\\nj=4: (-1)^2011 = -1\\nj=5: (-sqrt(2)/2)^2011 = -a\\nj=6: 0\\nj=7: (sqrt(2)/2)^2011 = a\\n\\nSum = 1 + a + 0 - a -1 - a +0 + a = (1 -1) + (a - a - a + a) + (0+0) = 0\\n\\nSo the sum is zero.\\n\\nP(S_n=0) = (1/8)*0 = 0.\\n\\nStep 12: Conclude P_total = (P(S_n=0))^2 = 0^2 = 0.\\n\\nHence, the probability is zero.\\n\\nInterpretation:\\n\\nBecause n=2011 is odd, it is impossible to return to the origin modulo 8 under these movement rules. Indeed, since each step increments x and y by ±1, the parity of coordinate sums changes each step. Returning to origin modulo 8 requires the sum of x and y increments to be even number, which is impossible after an odd number of steps.\\n\\nFinal answer:\\n\\nn = 2011\\nProbability = 0\\n\\nHence,\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"answer\\\": \\\"0\\\"\\n}\\n\",\n    \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
