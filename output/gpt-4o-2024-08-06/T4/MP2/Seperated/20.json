Because each move covers two squares, the number of moves is at most \\(1011\\).\n\nStep 14: To force more uncovered squares, Alice tries to create \"gaps\" of size 1 between tiles.\n\nBut Bob can prevent creation of multiple gaps.\n\nHence, Alice can guarantee at least 1 uncovered square.\n\nBut can she guarantee 2 or more?\n\nStep 15: Let's consider that if Alice tries to make a gap, Bob can place a tile blocking the gap, reducing number of gaps.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of uncovered squares Alice can guarantee is 1.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of uncovered squares Alice can ensure at the end is 1.\n\n---\n\nFinal answers:\n\nProblem 1 solutions:\n- n=1, k1=1\n- n=3, (2,3,6)\n- n=4, all ki=4\n\nProblem 2:\nGreatest number of uncovered squares Alice can guarantee is 1.\n\n---\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1 involves finding positive integers n and k_i such that the sum of k_i equals 5n - 4 and the sum of their reciprocals equals 1. Testing small values of n reveals some solutions: n=1 with k_1=1, n=3 with (2,3,6) which satisfies both conditions, and n=4 with all k_i=4 since 4*4=16=5*4-4 and sum of reciprocals is 4*(1/4)=1. No other n-values yield integer solutions. Thus, the solutions are n=1 with k=1, n=3 with (2,3,6), and n=4 with all four k_i=4. Problem 2 involves a game where Alice and Bob place dominoes on a 2022-square row, and Alice aims to maximize uncovered squares. Since 2022 is even, and dominoes cover two squares each move, the max dominoes that can be placed is 1011, covering all squares if played optimally. Alice can try to create isolated squares to remain uncovered, but Bob can always prevent multiple such gaps forming. Therefore, Alice can guarantee at least 1 uncovered square but no more. So Alice can ensure the greatest number of uncovered squares at the end is 1.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"n=1, k1=1; n=3, k1=2, k2=3, k3=6; n=4, k1=k2=k3=k4=4\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
