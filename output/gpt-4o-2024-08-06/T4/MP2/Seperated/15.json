      "A3384": "One day, there is a Street Art Show at somewhere, and there are some spectators around. We consider this place as an Euclidean plane. Let $K$ be the center of the show. And name the spectators by $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}, \\ldots$ They pick their positions $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}, \\ldots$ one by one. The positions need to satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously. (i) The distance between $K$ and $A_{n}$ is no less than 10 meters, that is, $K P_{n} \\geq 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any positive integer $n$. (ii) The distance between $A_{n}$ and any previous spectator is no less than 1 meter, that is, $P_{m} P_{n} \\geq 1 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any $n \\geq 2$ and any $1 \\leq m \\leq n-1$. (iii) $A_{n}$ always choose the position closest to $K$ that satisfies (i) and (ii), that is, $K P_{n}$ reaches its minimum possible value. If there are more than one point that satisfy (i) and (ii) and have the minimum distance to $K, A_{n}$ may choose any one of them. For example, $A_{1}$ is not restricted by (ii), so he may choose any point on the circle $C$ which is centered at $K$ with radius 10 meters. For $A_{2}$, since there are lots of points on $C$ which are at least 1 meter apart from $P_{1}$, he may choose anyone of them. (1) Which of the following statement is true? (A) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2}$ always hold (unit: meter); (B) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\sqrt{n} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} \\sqrt{n}$ always hold (unit: meter); (C) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n$ always hold (unit: meter); (D) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n^{2} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n^{2}$ always hold (unit: meter)."

100) \\\\).\\n\\nStep 5: We can invert this:\\nGiven \\\\( n \\\\) points, roughly the radius needed to hold \\\\( n \\\\) points spaced by 1 is:\\n\\\\[ n \\\\approx \\\\pi (R^2 - 100) \\\\implies R^2 \\\\approx \\\\frac{n}{\\\\pi} + 100 \\\\implies R \\\\sim \\\\sqrt{n}. \\\\]\\n\\nStep 6: The points must have radius at least 10, so the minimal radius grows like \\\\( \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\).\\nAlso, since the spectators pick positions closest to \\\\( K \\\\) that satisfy the spacing, \\\\( K P_n \\\\) grows like some constant times \\\\( \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\).\\n\\nStep 7: Hence, there are positive constants \\\\( c_1, c_2 \\\\) such that\\n\\\\[ c_1 \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\leq K P_n \\\\leq c_2 \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\]\\nfor large \\\\( n \\\\), no matter how the points are chosen.\\n\\nStep 8: Conclusion:\\nOption (B) is correct.\\n\\nSummary of answers:\\n- Problem 1: All real solutions for each n is \\\\( x = 4 \\\\) only.\\n- Problem 2: (B) is the true statement.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"B\"\n}",
