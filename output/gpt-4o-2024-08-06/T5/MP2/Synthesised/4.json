The second part asks to find the smallest real r > d = 0 for which differentiable functions f,g satisfy the specified conditions, which form inequalities very close to and including the system f' = +/- g, g' = +/- f. Testing the cases yields that the minimal r satisfying all conditions is when f(r)=0 with initial conditions f(0)>0 and g(0)=0. This is satisfied for the harmonic oscillator system f'' = -f, with general solution f(x) = C cos x + D sin x, with g(x) = f'(x).
