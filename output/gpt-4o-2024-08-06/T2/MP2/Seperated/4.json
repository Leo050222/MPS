  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:\n- There are 32 players, and the tournament is a single-elimination knockout.\n- Each round halves the number of players until one winner remains after 5 rounds.\n- The question: What is the probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other at some point in the tournament?\n\nLet's analyze the problem carefully:\n\n1. Total players: 32\n2. Number of rounds: 5 (Round 1 has 32 players, Round 2 has 16, then 8, 4, 2, and finally winner)\n3. Ava and Tiffany can only meet if both survive until they are paired.\n\nWe want the probability that Ava and Tiffany confront each other in at least one round.\n\nKey approach:\n- For each round \\(k\\) (from 1 to 5), calculate the probability that Ava and Tiffany meet exactly in round \\(k\\).\n- The probability that they meet in at least one round = sum over k of (probability that meet in round k).\n\nImportant: Ava and Tiffany must both survive until round \\(k\\), and then get paired.\n\nLet's define:\n\n- \\(N_r =\\) number of players in round \\(r\\)\n- \\(N_1 = 32, N_2 = 16, N_3 = 8, N_4 = 4, N_5 = 2\\)\n\nProbability that Ava survives to round \\(r\\): Since probabilities are symmetric and winning each match is 1/2, the probability that Ava survives through \\(r-1\\) rounds is \\((1/2)^{r-1}\\).\nSimilarly for Tiffany.\n\nProbability that both survive to round \\(r\\) is \\((1/2)^{2(r-1)} = (1/4)^{r-1}\\).\n\nNumber of players in round \\(r\\) is \\(N_r = \\frac{32}{2^{r-1}} = 32 \\cdot 2^{-(r-1)}\\).\n\nNow, given both Ava and Tiffany reach round \\(r\\), what is the probability that they are paired in that round?\n\nGiven \\(N_r\\) players, they are paired uniformly at random.\n\nNumber of ways to pair players: For \\(N_r\\) even, the number of pairings is the number of perfect matchings, but we don't need total number of pairings, just the probability a fixed pair are paired.\n\nProbability that Ava is paired with Tiffany in round \\(r\\):\n\n- Ava must be paired with Tiffany, not any other.\n\n- Since pairings are uniformly random over all perfect matchings, by symmetry, the probability that Ava is paired with Tiffany is \\(\\frac{1}{N_r - 1}\\) because Ava has \\(N_r - 1\\) potential opponents.\n\nThus, the probability meet in round \\(r\\):\n\n\\[\nP_r = \\text{(both reach round r)} \\times \\text{(paired to each other in round r)} = (1/4)^{r-1} \\times \\frac{1}{N_r - 1}\n\\]\n\nLet's compute \\(N_r - 1\\) for each round:\n\n- \\(r=1: N_1=32 \\Rightarrow N_1-1=31\\)\n- \\(r=2: N_2=16 \\Rightarrow 15\\)\n- \\(r=3: N_3=8 \\Rightarrow 7\\)\n- \\(r=4: N_4=4 \\Rightarrow 3\\)\n- \\(r=5: N_5=2 \\Rightarrow 1\\)\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\nP_r = (1/4)^{r-1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{N_r-1}\n\\]\n\nSum over all rounds:\n\n\\[\nP = \\sum_{r=1}^{5} (1/4)^{r-1} \\frac{1}{N_r - 1} = \\frac{1}{31} + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{1}{16} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{64} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 1\n\\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n- \\(r=1: \\frac{1}{31}\\)\n- \\(r=2: \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{1}{60}\\)\n- \\(r=3: \\frac{1}{16} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{1}{112}\\)\n- \\(r=4: \\frac{1}{64} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{192}\\)\n- \\(r=5: \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{256}\\)\n\nNow find common denominator or convert to decimals and sum:\n\nAlternatively, find LCM or sum fractions carefully:\n\nLet's write all denominators:\n\n31, 60, 112, 192, 256.\n\nUse common denominator \\( = 31 \\times 60 \\times 112 \\times 192 \\times 256 \\) would be huge.\n\nInstead, sum as decimals and then find fraction:\n\n- \\(1/31 \\approx 0.0322580645\\)\n- \\(1/60 = 0.0166666667\\)\n- \\(1/112 \\approx 0.0089285714\\)\n- \\(1/192 \\approx 0.0052083333\\)\n- \\(1/256 = 0.00390625\\)\n\nSum:\n\n0.0322580645 + 0.0166666667 = 0.0489247312\n\n0.0489247312 + 0.0089285714 = 0.0578533026\n\n0.0578533026 + 0.0052083333 = 0.0630616359\n\n0.0630616359 + 0.00390625 = 0.0669678859\n\nSo total probability ≈ 0.0669678859\n\nConvert this decimal to fraction:\n\nLet's try to find exact fraction sum.\n\nWrite each fraction with denominator their products carefully, or find a better way.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nExpress all fractions with denominator  (31 * 960):\n\nBecause 31 * 960 = 29760, note that 960 is divisible by 60, 112, 192, 256?\n\n- 60 | 960  (960/60 = 16)\n- 112 | 960?
