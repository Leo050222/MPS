  "math_problem": "Victoria wants to order at least 550 donuts from Dunkin' Donuts for the HMMT 2014 November contest. However, donuts only come in multiples of twelve. Assuming every twelve donuts cost $7.49, what is the minimum amount Victoria needs to pay, in dollars? Instead of computing the minimum cost to acquire at least the required number of units when purchases are constrained to multiples of the base quantity, simply find $e = \\left\\lfloor 550 / 12 \\right\\rfloor - 43$. There are two prime numbers $p$ so that $5 p$ can be expressed in the form $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n^{e}}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ for some positive integer $n$. What is the sum of these two prime numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. Victoria wants to order at least 550 donuts. Donuts come in multiples of 12. Every 12 donuts cost $7.49.\n   - While the cost part is given, the problem instructions explicitly say: \"Instead of computing the minimum cost to acquire at least the required number of units when purchases are constrained to multiples of the base quantity, simply find \\( e = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{550}{12} \\right\\rfloor - 43 \\).\"\n   \n2. So first let's compute \\( e \\):\n   \\[\n   e = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{550}{12} \\right\\rfloor - 43\n   \\]\n   \n   Calculate \\(\\frac{550}{12}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{550}{12} = 45.8333...\n   \\]\n   \n   So,\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{550}{12} \\right\\rfloor = 45\n   \\]\n   \n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   e = 45 - 43 = 2\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, the problem states:\n   > There are two prime numbers \\( p \\) so that \\( 5p \\) can be expressed in the form \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^e}{5} \\right\\rfloor \\) for some positive integer \\( n \\).\n\n   We have:\n   \\[\n   5p = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^e}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{5} \\right\\rfloor\n   \\]\n   \n   Given \\( e=2 \\).\n\n4. We want to find all prime numbers \\( p \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   5p = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{5} \\right\\rfloor\n   \\]\n   for some positive integer \\( n \\).\n\n5. Since \\( p \\) is prime, and \\( 5p \\) must be an integer floor value.\n\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 5p \\implies 5p \\leq \\frac{n^2}{5} < 5p + 1\n   \\]\n   \n   Multiply all parts by 5:\n   \\[\n   25p \\leq n^2 < 25p + 5\n   \\]\n\n6. For integer \\( n \\), \\( n^2 \\) lies in the interval \\([25p, 25p + 5)\\).\n\n7. So, for each prime \\( p \\), we want to find if there exists an integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 \\) satisfies:\n   \\[\n   25p \\leq n^2 < 25p + 5\n   \\]\n\n8. We look for integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 \\in [25p, 25p + 4] \\) (since \\(25p+5\\) is exclusive, the max integer value of \\(n^2\\) can be \\(25p + 4\\)).\n\n9. Because \\( n^2 \\) must lie in a 5-integer range (\\(25p\\) to \\(25p+4\\)), we check if the integer squares hit exactly one of these numbers.\n\n10. Because \\(n^2\\) must be in the interval, for each \\(p\\), consider the integer \\(n = 5m\\) or near \\(5m\\) because squares around multiples of 25.\n\n11. Let's check for primes \\( p \\) such that it's possible.\n\nStart with small primes:\n\n- \\( p = 2 \\)\n  \\[\n  25 \\cdot 2 = 50, \\quad 50 \\leq n^2 < 55\n  \\]\n  \n  Which integer squares lie in [50,54]?\n  \n  Squares near 50:\n  \\[\n  7^2 = 49 \\quad \\text{too low}, \\quad 8^2 = 64 \\quad \\text{too big}\n  \\]\n  No integer squares in [50..54].\n  \n- \\( p = 3 \\)\n  \\[\n  25 \\cdot 3 = 75, \\quad 75 \\leq n^2 < 80\n  \\]\n  \n  Nearby squares:\n  \\[\n  8^2 = 64 \\quad \\text{too low}, \\quad 9^2 = 81 \\quad \\text{too high}\n  \\]\n  \n  No integers squares in [75..79].\n  \n- \\( p = 5 \\)\n  \\[\n  125 \\leq n^2 < 130\n  \\]\n  \n  Nearby squares:\n  \\[\n  11^2 = 121 \\quad \\text{too low}, \\quad 12^2 = 144 \\quad \\text{too high}\n  \\]\n  \n  No integer squares in [125..129].\n  \n- \\( p = 7 \\)\n  \\[\n  175 \\leq n^2 < 180\n  \\]\n  \n  Nearby squares:\n  \\[\n  13^2 = 169 \\quad \\text{too low}, \\quad 14^2 = 196 \\quad \\text{too high}\n  \\]\n  \n  No squares in [175..179].\n  \n- \\( p = 11 \\)\n  \\[\n  275 \\leq n^2 < 280\n  \\]\n  \n  Nearby squares:\n  \\[\n  16^2 = 256 \\quad \\text{too low}, \\quad 17^2 = 289 \\quad \\text{too high}\n  \\]\n  \n  No squares in [275..279].\n  \n- \\( p = 13 \\)\n  \\[\n  25 \\times 13 = 325, \\quad n^2 \\in [325..329]\n  \\]\n  \n  Nearby squares:\n  \\[\n  18^2 = 324 \\quad \\text{too low (just one less)}, \\quad 19^2 = 361 \\quad \\text{too high}\n  \\]\n  \n  No squares in the range.\n  \n- \\( p = 17 \\)\n  \\[\n  425 \\leq n^2 < 430\n  \\]\n  \n  Nearby squares:\n  \\[\n  20^2 = 400 \\quad \\text{too low}, \\quad 21^2 = 441 \\quad \\text{too high}\n  \\]\n  \n  No squares in [425..429].\n  \n- \\( p = 19 \\)\n  \\[\n  475 \\leq n^2 < 480\n  \\]\n  \n  Nearby squares:\n  \\[\n  21^2 = 441 \\quad \\text{too low}, \\quad 22^2 = 484 \\quad \\text{too high}\n  \\]\n  \n  No squares in [475..479].\n  \n- \\( p = 23 \\)\n  \\[\n  575 \\leq n^2 < 580\n  \\]\n  \n  Nearby squares:\n  \\[\n  23^2 = 529 \\quad \\text{too low}, \\quad 24^2 = 576 \\quad \\text{inside range}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\(24^2 = 576\\) is inside [575..579].\n  \n  So for \\( p = 23 \\), \\( n = 24 \\):\n  \\[\n  5p = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{576}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 115.2 \\right\\rfloor = 115\n  \\]\n  Since \\( 5p = 115 \\), \\( p = 23 \\).\n  \n  So one prime \\( p \\) is 23.\n  \n- Next, try \\( p = 29 \\)\n  \\[\n  25 \\times 29 = 725, \\quad n^2 \\in [725..729]\n  \\]\n  \n  Nearby squares:\n  \\[\n  26^2 = 676 \\quad \\text{too low}, \\quad 27^2 = 729 \\quad \\text{inside range}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\(27^2 = 729\\) fits in [725..729].\n  \n  So, for \\( p = 29 \\), \\( n = 27 \\),\n  \\[\n  5p = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{729}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 145.8 \\right\\rfloor = 145\n  \\]\n  \n  \\(5p = 145 \\implies p = 29\\), confirming \\( p=29 \\) is the second prime.\n  \n12.
