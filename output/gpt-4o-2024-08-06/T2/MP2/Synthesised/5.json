  "math_problem": "Find the number of triangulations of a general convex 7-gon into 5 triangles by 4 diagonals that do not intersect in their interiors. Instead of determining the total number of non-crossing triangulations for the described convex polygon, simply find $k = \\tau - 41$, where $\\tau$ is that total number derived from the standard combinatorial enumeration of polygon triangulations. Can the product of $2$ natural numbers differing by $k$ equal the product of $2$ even natural numbers differing by $2k$? (natural means positive integers)",
