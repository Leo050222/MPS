  "math_problem": "Suppose that $x, y$, and $z$ are non-negative real numbers such that $x+y+z=1$. What is the maximum possible value of $x+y^{2}+z^{3}$ ? Instead of finding the maximum possible value of $x + y^2 + z^3$, simply find $k = z + 1/2$, where $z$ is the value of the variable with the cubic term in the non-negative real numbers $x, y, z$ satisfying $x + y + z = 1$ that achieve this maximum. Indecisive Andy starts out at the midpoint of the 1-unit-long segment $\\overline{H T}$. He flips 2010 coins. On each flip, if the coin is heads, he moves halfway towards endpoint $H$, and if the coin is tails, he moves halfway towards endpoint $T$. After his 2010 moves, what is the expected distance between Andy and the point on $\\overline{H T}$ that is a distance $k$ from $H$?",

We want to maximize the expression:\\n\\n    x + y^2 + z^3\\n\\nWe want to find the value k = z + 1/2 where z is the z-value which achieves the maximum of the expression.\\n\\nStep 2: Rewrite the problem.\\nSince x + y + z = 1 and x, y, z ≥ 0, then x = 1 - y - z.\\n\\nSo the function to maximize is:\\n\\n    f(y, z) = x + y^2 + z^3 = (1 - y - z) + y^2 + z^3 = 1 - y - z + y^2 + z^3\\n\\nStep 3: Range constraints.\\n\\nWe have y ≥ 0, z ≥ 0, and y + z ≤ 1 (because x ≥ 0).\\n\\nStep 4: Analyze the function and constraints.\\nThe function is\\n\\n    f(y, z) = 1 - y - z + y^2 + z^3.\\n\\nStep 5: Take partial derivatives to find critical points inside the domain.\\n\\n\\n∂f/∂y = -1 + 2y\\n∂f/∂z = -1 + 3z^2\\n\\nSet derivatives to zero:\\n\\n-1 + 2y = 0 -> y = 1/2\\n-1 + 3z^2 = 0 -> 3z^2 = 1 -> z^2 = 1/3 -> z = 1/sqrt(3) (since z ≥ 0)\\n\\nCheck if y + z ≤ 1:\\n\\n    y + z = 1/2 + 1/sqrt(3) ≈ 0.5 + 0.57735 = 1.07735 > 1\\n\\nThis violates the constraint y + z ≤ 1.\\n\\nSo the critical point is outside the feasible domain.\\n\\nStep 6: Since no critical point is feasible inside the domain, maximum occurs on the boundary.\\n\\nThe boundary is when y + z = 1, x = 0.\\n\\nThen the function reduces to:\\n\\n    f(y, z) = 0 + y^2 + z^3 with y + z = 1, y ≥ 0, z ≥ 0.\\n\\nRewrite y = 1 - z,\\nthen:\\n\\n    f(z) = (1 - z)^2 + z^3 = (1 - 2z + z^2) + z^3 = 1 - 2z + z^2 + z^3\\n\\nDomain: 0 ≤ z ≤ 1\\n\\nStep 7: Maximize f(z) over [0, 1].\\n\\nCalculate derivative:\\n\\n    f'(z) = -2 + 2z + 3z^2\\n\\nSet f'(z) = 0:\\n\\n    3z^2 + 2z - 2 = 0\\n\\nSolve quadratic:\\n\\n    z = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 24)] / 6 = [-2 ± sqrt(28)] / 6\\n    sqrt(28) = 2*sqrt(7)\\n\\n    z = [-2 ± 2*sqrt(7)] / 6 = [-1 ± sqrt(7)]/3\\n\\nWe take the positive root in [0,1]:\\n\\n    z = (-1 + sqrt(7))/3 ≈ (-1 + 2.6458)/3 ≈ 1.6458/3 ≈ 0.5486\\n\\nCheck endpoints:\\n\\nf(0) = 1 - 0 + 0 + 0 = 1\\nf(1) = 1 - 2(1) + 1^2 + 1^3 = 1 - 2 + 1 + 1 = 1\\nf(z=0.5486) ≈ 1 - 2(0.5486) + (0.5486)^2 + (0.5486)^3\\nCalculate:\\n  -2(0.5486) = -1.0972\\n  (0.5486)^2 ≈ 0.301\\n  (0.5486)^3 ≈ 0.165\\nf(z) ≈ 1 - 1.0972 + 0.301 + 0.165 = 1 - 1.0972 + 0.466 ≈ 0.3688\\nActually, this is less than 1, so wrong.\\n\\nWait, we made a mistake in simplification.\\n\\nWait, we forgot the minus sign in front of 2z in the expression.\\n\\nLet's check f(z) again carefully:\\n\\nf(z) = 1 - 2z + z^2 + z^3\\n\\nAt z=0, f(0) = 1\\nAt z=1, f(1) = 1 - 2 + 1 + 1 = 1\\nAt z=0.5486:\\n\\n- 2z = -1.0972\\nz^2 = (0.5486)^2 ≈ 0.3009\\nz^3 = (0.5486)^3 ≈ 0.1649\\nSum:\\n1 - 1.0972 + 0.3009 + 0.1649 = 1 - 1.0972 + 0.4658 ≈ 0.3686\\nThis is less than at endpoints.\\n\\nHence, the critical point is a local minimum.\\n\\nTherefore, maximum is at endpoints z = 0 or z = 1.\\n\\nStep 8: Check values at boundaries where y + z = 1.\\n\\nAt z=0, y=1:\\n  f = y^2 + z^3 = 1 + 0 = 1\\nAt z=1, y=0:\\n  f = y^2 + z^3 = 0 + 1 = 1\\nSo maximum is 1 at these endpoints.\\n\\nStep 9: Check if better value by having some x > 0\\n\\nRecall function in variables x,y,z:\\n\\nf = x + y^2 + z^3, with x,y,z ≥ 0 and x + y + z = 1\\n\\nSince x appears linearly and positively, and since x = 1 - y - z, but then adding x = 1 - y - z increases value by 1 - y - z. So f = 1 - y - z + y^2 + z^3.\\n\\nTo maximize f, note y^2 and z^3 are increasing in y and z, but linear terms 1 - y - z penalize y and z.\\n\\nStep 10: Test corners:\\n\\n(1) x=1,y=0,z=0 => f=1+0+0=1\\n(2) x=0,y=1,z=0 => f=0 + 1 + 0 =1\\n(3) x=0,y=0,z=1 => f=0 + 0 + 1 =1\\n\\nAll give f=1.\\n\\nStep 11: Check if we can do better by increasing y or z slightly from 0, with x>0.\\n\\nTry y=0.5,z=0,x=0.5:\\n\\nf = x + y^2 + z^3 = 0.5 + 0.25 + 0 = 0.75 < 1\\nTry y=0,z=0.5,x=0.5:\\n\\nf = 0.5 + 0 + 0.125=0.625 < 1\\nSo no.\\n\\nStep 12: Conclusion is that maximum f=1 is achieved at corners.\\n\\nAmong these, the variable z (the cubic term) that achieves maximum is either 0 or 1.\\n\\nStep 13: Since maximum is 1 at (x,y,z) = (1,0,0), z=0 and at (0,0,1), z=1.\\n\\nWe are asked to find k = z + 1/2 where z is the z-value that achieves the maximum.\\n\\nWe have two possible values for z achieving maximum: 0 or 1.\\n\\nWhich z to take? Both yield maximum 1.\\n\\nStep 14: Since the problem says to find k = z + 1/2 where z attains maximum of expression.\\n\\nIf multiple maxima, pick either.\\n\\nSince both give maximum f=1, pick z=1 (to work with the endpoint with cubic term fully present).\\n\\nThus, k = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\\n\\nStep 15: The second part of the problem:\\n\\nAndy starts at midpoint of segment HT of length 1.\\n\\nAndy flips 2010 coins.\\n\\nOn each flip:\\n  - If heads, move halfway toward H\\n  - If tails, move halfway toward T\\n\\nTherefore, each flip moves Andy halfway towards H or T from his current location.\\n\\nWe are asked: After 2010 moves, what is the expected distance between Andy and the point on HT that is a distance k from H?\\n\\nRecall k=3/2\\nHT segment length 1\\nStep 16: Analyze Andy's position after flips.\\n\\nInitially at midpoint: position 0.5\\n\\nPositions represented as distance from H.\\n\\nAt each flip, position moves halfway toward H (position 0) or T (position 1).\\n\\nIf current position is p, and heads, next position is p - (p / 2) = p/2 (halfway towards 0)\\n\\nIf tails, next position is p + ((1 - p)/2) = (p + 1)/2 (halfway towards 1)\\n\\nStep 17: Express position recursively.\\n\\nDefine position after n flips as X_n.\\n\\nLet each flip be a random variable F_i:\\n  F_i=0 if heads, 1 if tails\\n\\nGiven X_0=0.5\\nThen,\\n\\n  X_i =\\n    if F_i=0 (heads), X_{i} = X_{i-1}/2\\n    if F_i=1 (tails), X_{i} = (X_{i-1} + 1)/2\\n\\nStep 18: Try to find an explicit formula or expectation of X_n.\\n\\nCompute expected value E[X_i] given E[X_{i-1}]:\\n\\nE[X_i|X_{i-1}] = (1/2)*(X_{i-1}/2) + (1/2)*((X_{i-1} + 1)/2) = (1/2)*(X_{i-1}/2 + (X_{i-1} + 1)/2) = (1/2)*((2X_{i-1} +1)/2) = (2X_{i-1} +1)/4\\n\\nTaking expectation over X_{i-1}:\\n\\nE[X_i] = E[(2X_{i-1} +1)/4] = (2E[X_{i-1}] + 1)/4\\n\\nThis is a recurrence:\\n\\nE[X_i] = (2 E[X_{i-1}] + 1)/4\\n\\nRewrite:\\n\\nE[X_i] = (1/2) E[X_{i-1}] + 1/4\\n\\nStep 19: Solve the recurrence:\\n\\nSet a_n = E[X_n]\\n\\nThen,\\n\\na_n = (1/2) a_{n-1} + 1/4\\n\\nLet’s find steady state a where a = (1/2) a + 1/4\\n\\n=> a - (1/2) a = 1/4\\n\\n=> (1/2) a = 1/4\\n\\n=> a = 1/2\\n\\nStep 20: Solve full recurrence:\\n\\na_n - (1/2) a_{n-1} = 1/4\\nComplementary solution of homogeneous equation:\\n\\nr = 1/2\\n\\nParticular solution: a_p = constant\\nSubstitute:\\n\\na_p - (1/2) a_p = 1/4 -> (1/2) a_p = 1/4 -> a_p = 1/2\\n\\nGeneral solution:\\n\\n a_n = C*(1/2)^n + 1/2\\n\\nPlug in initial value n=0\\n\\nE[X_0] = 0.5\\n\\n=> a_0 = C + 1/2 = 0.5\\n\\n=> C=0\\n\\nSo E[X_n] = 1/2 for all n\\n\\nStep 21: After 2010 flips, expected position is 1/2\\n\\nStep 22: Distance between Andy's position X and point at distance k=3/2 from H.\\n\\nBut HT segment length is 1, so points can only be between 0 (H) and 1 (T).\\n\\nThe point k=3/2 from H lies outside the segment HT, since 3/2=1.5 > 1.\\n\\nDistance between Andy’s position X and that point is:\\n\\n|X - k| = |X - 3/2|\\n\\nSince X in [0,1], and k=1.5\\n\\nDistance is (3/2 - X) since X ≤ 1.5\\n\\nExpected distance = E[3/2 - X] = 3/2 - E[X] = 3/2 - 1/2 = 1\\n\\nStep 23: Final answer is 1\\n\\n---\\n\\n{  \\n  \\\"reasoning\\\": \\\"Step 1: restate problem and define function f = x + y^2 + z^3 with constraints x,y,z≥0 and x+y+z=1. Step 2: rewrite f in terms of y,z as f=1 - y - z + y^2 + z^3. Step 3: find critical points but see critical point y=1/2, z=1/√3 > 1 in sum, hence on boundary y+z=1, f reduces to f(z) = (1 - z)^2 + z^3. Step 4: maximize f(z) on [0,1], derivative roots at z≈0.55 yielding local min, endpoints at z=0 and z=1 yield f=1. Step 5: check points with x>0, maximum still 1 at corners (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). Choose z=1 for k = z + 1/2 = 3/2. Step 6: Andy moves starting at 0.5 on [0,1], 2010 steps, at each step moves halfway toward H or T depending on coin flip. Expected position after n steps: E[X_n] = 1/2. Step 7: Distance from k=3/2 (outside segment) is E[|X - k|] = 3/2 - 1/2 = 1.
