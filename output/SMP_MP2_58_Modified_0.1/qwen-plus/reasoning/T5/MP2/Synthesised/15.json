Instead of finding all monic polynomials with integer coefficients such that there exists a positive integer $N$ where for every prime $p>N$ with $f(p)$ a positive integer, $p$ divides $2(f(p)!)+1$, simply find $d = k - 2$, where $k$ is the absolute value of the constant term in the unique linear monic polynomial with integer coefficients that satisfies the condition. Does there exist a function $f: \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R $  satisfying the following conditions: \n(i) for each real $y$  there is a real  $x$ such that $f(x)=y$ , and \n(ii)  $f(f(x)) = (x - d)f(x) + 2$ for all real $x$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, consider linear monic polynomials $ f(x) = x + c $ with integer coefficients. For primes $ p > N $, $ f(p) = p + c $ must be positive, so $ c $ is likely negative. Let $ c = -m $ (positive integer $ m $), so $ f(p) = p - m $. The condition requires $ 2((p - m)!) \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. Using Wilson's theorem, $ (p - 1)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. For $ m = 3 $, $ (p - 1)! = (p - 1)(p - 2)(p - 3)! \\\\equiv (-1)(-2)(p - 3)! = 2(p - 3)! \\\\mod p $, so $ 2(p - 3)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $, which satisfies $ 2((p - 3)!) + 1 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod p $. Testing primes (e.g., $ p = 5, 7, 11 $) confirms this. For other $ m $, the congruence fails for large primes. Thus, the unique linear polynomial is $ f(x) = x - 3 $, with constant term $ -3 $. The absolute value $ k = 3 $, so $ d = k - 2 = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, check if a function $ f: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} $ exists with $ d = 1 $, satisfying surjectivity and $ f(f(x)) = (x - 1)f(x) + 2 $. Assume surjectivity: there exists $ a $ with $ f(a) = -1 $. Then $ f(f(a)) = f(-1) = (a - 1)(-1) + 2 = -a + 3 $. Also, $ f(0) = 2 $ (from $ x = 2 $: $ f(f(2)) = f(0) = 0 + 2 = 2 $), and $ f(2) = 0 $ (from $ x = 0 $: $ f(f(0)) = f(2) = -2 + 2 = 0 $). For $ x = 1 $, $ f(f(1)) = 2 $, so $ f(1) = 0 $ (since $ f(x) = 2 $ only at $ x = 0 $). For $ f(b) = 1 $, $ f(f(b)) = f(1) = 0 = b + 1 \\\\implies b = -1 $, so $ f(-1) = 1 $. Then $ f(-1) = 1 = -a + 3 \\\\implies a = 2 $, but $ f(2) = 0 \\\\neq -1 $, a contradiction. Hence, no such function exists.\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\"\n}",
