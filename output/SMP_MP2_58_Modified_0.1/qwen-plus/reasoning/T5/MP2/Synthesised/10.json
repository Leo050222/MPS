For every nonnegative integer $j$, let\n\\[S(j) = \\sum_{n \\in A} n^j.\\]\nDetermine all values of $j$ such that $S(j)$ is a multiple of 2021. Instead of determining the nonnegative integers $j$ for which the power sum over the residues coprime to the modulus is divisible by the modulus, simply find $k = d - 1$, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of the distinct prime factors of the modulus. Determine the maximum value of the sum\n\\[S = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{n}{2^n} (a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n)^{1/n}\\]\nover all sequences $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\cdots$ of real numbers satisfying $a_k \\geq k$ for each $k$ and\n\\[\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty a_k = 1.\\]",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem initially describes a set A of integers coprime to 2021 and a sum S(j), but explicitly instructs to ignore determining values of j and instead compute k = d - 1, where d is the gcd of the distinct prime factors of the modulus (2021). Factoring 2021 gives 43 × 47, both primes. The distinct prime factors are 43 and 47, whose gcd is 1. Thus, d = 1, so k = 1 - 1 = 0. The subsequent part about maximizing a sum S appears to be irrelevant or a misdirection, as the problem explicitly directs to focus on k = d - 1.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
