For large primes $ p $, $ f(p) = p + c $ must be positive, so $ c < 0 $. Let $ c = -m $ ($ m > 0 $). The condition requires $ 2((p - m)!) \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. Using Wilson's theorem, $ (p - 1)! \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. Expanding $ (p - 1)! = (p - 1)(p - 2)\\\\cdots(p - m)(p - m - 1)! \\\\equiv (-1)^m m! (p - m - 1)! \\\\mod p $, we derive $ 2((p - m)!) \\\\equiv -1 \\\\mod p $. Solving for $ m $, we find $ m = 3 $ satisfies $ 2 \\\\cdot (-1)^3 / (3 - 1)! = -1 $, leading to $ c = -3 $. The constant term is $ -3 $, so $ k = 3 $ and $ d = k - 2 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume such a function $ f $ exists. From surjectivity, there exists $ c $ with $ f(c) = -1 $. Plugging $ x = c $ into the functional equation gives $ f(-1) = (c - 1)(-1) + 2 = -c + 3 $. However, $ f(-1) = 1 $ (from $ x = -1 $: $ f(f(-1)) = 0 $ implies $ -2f(-1) + 2 = 0 $), so $ 1 = -c + 3 \\\\Rightarrow c = 2 $. But $ f(2) = 0 \\\\neq -1 $, contradicting surjectivity. Hence, no such function exists.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
