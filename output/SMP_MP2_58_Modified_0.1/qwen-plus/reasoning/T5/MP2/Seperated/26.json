Setting $x = 1$ gives $f(f(y)) = yf(1)$. Let $c = f(1)$. Setting $y = 1$ yields $f(cx) = f(x)$. Using $f(f(y)) = cy$, substituting $y = c$ gives $f(f(c)) = c^2$. But $f(c) = f(1 \\\\cdot c) = f(1) = c$, so $f(c) = c$, hence $f(f(c)) = f(c) = c$. Thus $c = c^2$, so $c = 1$ (since $c > 0$). Therefore $k = f(1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The product $(x_1^2 + 1)\\\\cdots(x_4^2 + 1)$ equals $|P(i)|^2 = (1 - b + d)^2 + (c - a)^2$. Given $b - d \\\\geq 5$, let $s = b - d \\\\geq 5$. Then $1 - b + d = 1 - s$, so the expression becomes $(1 - s)^2 + (c - a)^2$. Minimizing this requires $s = 5$ (smallest $s$) and $c = a$ (to eliminate the second term). For roots $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = x_4 = 1$, $b = 6$, $d = 1$, so $b - d = 5$, and $a = c = -4$. The product is $(1^2 + 1)^4 = 16$, which is minimal.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"16\"\n}",
