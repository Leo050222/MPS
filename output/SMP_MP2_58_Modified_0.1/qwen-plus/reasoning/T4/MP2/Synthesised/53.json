Instead of evaluating the interpolating polynomial at the next successive integer beyond the given points, simply find $m = Q(-1) + 1$, where $Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x$ is the auxiliary polynomial of degree $n+1$ that vanishes at $x=0,1,\\ldots,n$. Are there any triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive integers such that $(a-m)(b-m)(c-m) + 12$ is prime that properly divides the positive number $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc - 2017$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the polynomial $ P(x) $ of degree $ n $ such that $ P(k) = \\\\frac{k}{k+1} $ for $ k = 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots, n $. We are given an auxiliary polynomial $ Q(x) = (x+1)P(x) - x $, which is of degree $ n+1 $ and vanishes at $ x = 0, 1, \\\\ldots, n $. This implies:\\n\\n$$\\nQ(x) = c \\\\cdot x(x - 1)(x - 2)\\\\cdots(x - n)\\n$$\\n\\nfor some constant $ c $. Evaluating $ Q(-1) $, we find:\\n\\n$$\\nQ(-1) = (-1 + 1)P(-1) - (-1) = 1\\n$$\\n\\nAlso, from the product form:\\n\\n$$\\nQ(-1) = c \\\\cdot (-1)(-2)(-3)\\\\cdots(-(n+1)) = c \\\\cdot (-1)^{n+1}(n+1)!\\n$$\\n\\nEquating both expressions:\\n\\n$$\\nc \\\\cdot (-1)^{n+1}(n+1)! = 1 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad c = \\\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\\n$$\\n\\nNow, define $ m = Q(-1) + 1 $. Since $ Q(-1) = 1 $, it follows that:\\n\\n$$\\nm = 1 + 1 = 2\\n$$\\n\\nNext, we consider the condition involving triples $ (a, b, c) $ of positive integers such that:\\n\\n$$\\n(a - m)(b - m)(c - m) + 12 = (a - 2)(b - 2)(c - 2) + 12\\n$$\\n\\nis a **prime number** that **properly divides** the positive integer:\\n\\n$$\\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc - 2017\\n$$\\n\\nLet $ d = (a - 2)(b - 2)(c - 2) + 12 $, where $ d $ must be prime and satisfy $ 1 < d < N $, with $ N = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc - 2017 > 0 $.\\n\\nWe analyze various cases for small values of $ a, b, c $, and also consider general behavior. For all valid combinations where $ d $ is prime, we compute $ N $ and check whether $ d \\\\mid N $ and $ d < N $. However, in every case:\\n\\n- When $ d $ is prime, $ N $ is negative or zero (violating the requirement that $ N > 0 $).\\n- When $ N > 0 $, $ d $ is not prime or does not divide $ N $.\\n\\nFor example:\\n- If $ a = b = c = 15 $, then $ N = 2033 $, but $ d = 2209 = 47^2 $, not prime.\\n- If $ a = b = c = 21 $, then $ N = 8567 $, but $ d = 6871 $, which is not a divisor of $ N $.\\n\\nExtensive testing shows no triple $ (a, b, c) $ satisfies all conditions simultaneously. Thus, there are **no such triples** of positive integers.\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\"\n}",
