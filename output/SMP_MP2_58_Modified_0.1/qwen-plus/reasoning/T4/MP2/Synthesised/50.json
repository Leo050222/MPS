  "math_problem": "Let $f: \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function satisfying $f(x y)=f(x)+f(y)+1$ for all positive reals $x, y$. If $f(2)=0$, compute $f(2015)$. Instead of computing the value of $f$ at 2015, simply find $m = g(2) + 9$, where $g(x) = f(x) + 1$ is the continuous function satisfying $g(xy) = g(x) + g(y)$ for all positive reals $x, y$. $m$ points are equally spaced on a circle. A graph is a set of segments (possibly empty) drawn between pairs of points, so that every two points are joined by either zero or one segments. Two graphs are considered the same if we can obtain one from the other by rearranging the points. Let $N$ denote the number of graphs with the property that for any two points, there exists a path from one to the other among the segments of the graph. Estimate the value of $N$. If your answer is a positive integer $A$, your score on this problem will be the larger of 0 and $\\lfloor 20-5|\\ln (A / N)|\\rfloor$. Otherwise, your score will be zero.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, define $ g(x) = f(x) + 1 $. Substituting into the functional equation $ f(xy) = f(x) + f(y) + 1 $ gives $ g(xy) = g(x) + g(y) $, which is Cauchy's logarithmic functional equation. Since $ f $ is continuous, $ g $ must be a logarithmic function. Given $ f(2) = 0 $, we find $ g(2) = 1 $. Thus, $ m = g(2) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10 $. \\n\\nNext, $ m = 10 $ points on a circle correspond to unlabeled graphs (isomorphism classes) on 10 vertices. The number $ N $ of connected unlabeled graphs on 10 vertices is a known value from combinatorics (OEIS A001349), which is 11716571.\",\n    \"answer\": \"11716571\"\n}",
