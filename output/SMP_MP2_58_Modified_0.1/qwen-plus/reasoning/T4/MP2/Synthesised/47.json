  "math_problem": "Let $\\mathbb{N}$ denote the natural numbers. Compute the number of functions $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow\\{0,1, \\ldots, 16\\}$ such that $$f(x+17)=f(x) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f\\left(x^{2}\\right) \\equiv f(x)^{2}+15 \\quad(\\bmod 17)$$ for all integers $x \\geq 1$. Instead of computing the total number of such functions, simply find $k = a_2 + 4$, where $a_2$ is the number of valid function assignments up to the second level of the preimage tree under the squaring map rooted at 1, in the case where there are two valid choices for the value at the first preimage level. Let $f(x)=x^{3}+x+1$. Suppose $g$ is a cubic polynomial such that $g(0)=-1$, and the roots of $g$ are the squares of the roots of $f$. Find $g(k)$.",

When $f(1) = 2$, $f(16)$ has two valid choices: $2$ or $15$.\\n  - For level 2 nodes (4 and 13):\\n    - If $f(16) = 2$, then $f(4), f(13)$ each have 2 choices (solutions to $x^2 \\\\equiv 4 \\\\mod 17$), giving $2 \\\\times 2 = 4$ assignments.\\n    - If $f(16) = 15$, then $f(4), f(13)$ must be $0$ (only solution to $x^2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod 17$), giving $1$ assignment.\\n  - Total valid assignments up to level 2 when $f(1) = 2$ (two valid choices for level 1): $4 + 1 = 5$.\\n\\n- **Compute $k$**:\\n  - $a_2 = 5$ (number of valid assignments up to level 2), so $k = a_2 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9$.\\n\\n- **Polynomial $g(x)$**:\\n  - Roots of $f(x) = x^3 + x + 1$ are $\\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma$.
