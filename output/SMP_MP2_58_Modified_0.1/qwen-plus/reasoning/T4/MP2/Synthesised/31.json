  "math_problem": "Solve in integers the equation\n\\[ x^2+xy+y^2 = \\left(\\frac{x+y}{3}+1\\right)^3. \\] Instead of finding all integer solutions $(x, y)$, simply find $k$, the smallest positive value of $y + 20$ among all integer solutions $(x, y)$. Solve in the set of real numbers the equation \\[ k x^{k} - [x] = k, \\] where $ [x]$ denotes the integer part of $ x.$",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve the integer equation $x^2 + xy + y^2 = \\\\left(\\\\frac{x+y}{3} + 1\\\\right)^3$. Let $t = \\\\frac{x+y}{3}$ (integer), so $x + y = 3t$. Substitute $y = 3t - x$ into the equation, yielding $x^2 - 3tx + 9t^2 = (t+1)^3$. The discriminant of this quadratic in $x$ must be a perfect square: $D = 4t^3 - 15t^2 + 12t + 4$. Testing small integer values of $t$, valid solutions occur at $t = 0, 2, 6, 12, \\\\ldots$. For $t = 12$, $x = 53$, $y = -17$ gives $y + 20 = 3$, which is the smallest positive value of $y + 20$. Thus, $k = 3$.\\n\\nNext, solve $3x^3 - [x] = 3$ in real numbers. Let $n = [x]$ (integer part), so $n \\\\leq x < n+1$. The equation becomes $3x^3 = 3 + n$, so $x = \\\\sqrt[3]{1 + \\\\frac{n}{3}}$. Testing $n = 1$, $x = \\\\sqrt[3]{\\\\frac{4}{3}} \\\\approx 1.1006$, which satisfies $1 \\\\leq x < 2$ and $[x] = 1$. Other values of $n$ do not yield valid solutions. Thus, the only real solution is $x = \\\\sqrt[3]{\\\\frac{4}{3}}$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(4/3)^(1/3)\"\n}",
