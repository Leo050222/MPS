Setting $ y = 1 $ gives $ f(1) = f(0) + |f(1)| $. If $ f(1) \\\\geq 0 $, this implies $ f(0) = 0 $. If $ f(1) < 0 $, contradictions arise when checking other values (e.g., $ y = \\\\sqrt{2} $), so $ f(0) = 0 $. Thus, $ k = f(0) + 4 = 4 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The maximum number of circles through at least 4 of 7 points is constrained by geometric limits. Two distinct circles intersect in at most 2 points, so each pair of points can lie on at most 2 circles. With $ \\\\binom{7}{2} = 21 $ pairs, total pair-circle incidences are $ \\\\leq 42 $. Each circle with 4 points contributes 6 pairs, so $ 6k \\\\leq 42 \\\\implies k \\\\leq 7 $. This bound is achievable via configurations where 7 circles each contain 4 points, satisfying all geometric constraints.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}",
