Considering all positive integers $N$ with this property, what is the smallest positive integer $a$ that occurs in any of these expressions? Instead of identifying the minimal initial term in the unique representation of such $N$ as a sum of consecutive positive integers, simply find $d = a - 15$, where $a$ is the smallest positive integer serving as the initial term in any such representation derived from the condition that $N$ admits no other decompositions into consecutive sums for $k>1$."

For $N$ to have no other representations as a sum of $k > 1$ consecutive positive integers, $N$ must be such that $2N = 2 \\\\cdot 2017 \\\\cdot M$ (where $M = a + 1008$) has only one valid factorization $k \\\\cdot m$ with $k > 1$, $k < m$, and $k, m$ of opposite parity. This occurs when $M$ is a power of 2, specifically $M = 2^{10} = 1024$ (smallest $M$ ensuring $a > 0$). Thus, $a = 1024 - 1008 = 16$, and $d = a - 15 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The condition requires that for all $m$ coprime to $n$, the map $k \\\\mapsto mk \\\\mod n$ is a square in the symmetric group $S_n$. This holds if and only if $n = 1$ or $n$ is twice an odd positive integer (i.e., $n \\\\equiv 2 \\\\mod 4$). For $n = 1$, the trivial case works. For $n = 2m$ with $m$ odd, the multiplicative action splits into two isomorphic parts, ensuring cycle structures have even counts of even-length cycles, making them squares. Other $n$ (odd $>1$ or divisible by 4) fail due to odd cycle counts.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"n=1 or n is twice an odd positive integer\"\n}",
