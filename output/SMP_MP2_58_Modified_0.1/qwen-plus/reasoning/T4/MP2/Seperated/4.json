Testing values, n=66 works (66 divides 2^66 + 2 as verified via modular arithmetic for 6 and 11). Larger n < 100 (e.g., 67-99) fail. Thus, n=66, so e = 66 + 1926 = 1992.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of regions formed by h horizontal lines and s non-horizontal lines (no two parallel, no three concurrent) is given by R = 1 + h(s+1) + s(s+1)/2. Setting R=1992 leads to (s+1)(2h + s) = 3982. Factoring 3982 (2×11×181), valid factor pairs (a,b) where a=s+1, b=2h+s yield (h,s) pairs: (995,1), (176,10), (80,21).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1992\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"[(80, 21), (176, 10), (995, 1)]\"\n}",
