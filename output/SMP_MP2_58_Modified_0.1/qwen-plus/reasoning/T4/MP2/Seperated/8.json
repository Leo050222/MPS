  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Analyzing the conditions for the arithmetic and geometric sequences, we find that the common ratio $ r $ of the geometric sequence must satisfy $ \\\\gcd(r, m) = 1 $. This is derived from the requirement that the difference $ a_n - g_n $ is divisible by $ m $ for all $ n > 1 $ while the common difference $ d $ of the arithmetic sequence is not divisible by $ m $. Through modular arithmetic and examining the recurrence relations, it is shown that $ \\\\gcd(r, m) = 1 $ is necessary, leading to $ k = \\\\gcd(r, m) + 1 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: By substituting specific values (e.g., $ x = 0 $, $ y = 0 $) and analyzing polynomial solutions, we determine that the only functions satisfying the equation are the zero function $ f(x) = 0 $ and the square function $ f(x) = x^2 $. Verification confirms both satisfy the functional equation for all real $ x, y $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x)=0 and f(x)=x^2\"\n}",
