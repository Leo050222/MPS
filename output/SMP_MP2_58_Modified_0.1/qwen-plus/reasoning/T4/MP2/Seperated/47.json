  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The preimage tree rooted at 1 under squaring mod 17 has level 0: {1}, level 1: {16} (since 16² ≡ 1), and level 2: {4, 13} (since 4² ≡ 13² ≡ 16). The functional equation f(r²) ≡ f(r)² + 15 mod 17 imposes constraints. For f(1), solving f(1) = f(1)² + 15 gives f(1) = 2 or 16. For f(1) = 2, f(16) has two choices: 2 and 15. When f(16) = 2, f(4) and f(13) each have 2 choices (since 2 - 15 ≡ 4 mod 17, a quadratic residue), giving 4 assignments. When f(16) = 15, f(4) and f(13) each have 1 choice (0² ≡ 0), giving 1 assignment. Thus, a₂ = 4 + 1 = 5. Hence, k = a₂ + 4 = 9.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let roots of f(x) = x³ + x + 1 be α, β, γ. Then g(x) has roots α², β², γ². Using Vieta's formulas: α + β + γ = 0, αβ + βγ + γα = 1, αβγ = -1. Compute sums for g(x): α² + β² + γ² = -2, α²β² + β²γ² + γ²α² = 1, α²β²γ² = 1. Thus, g(x) = x³ + 2x² + x - 1. Evaluating at x = 9: 9³ + 2·9² + 9 - 1 = 899.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"899\"\n}",
