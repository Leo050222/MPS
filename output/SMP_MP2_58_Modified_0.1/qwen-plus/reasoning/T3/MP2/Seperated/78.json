Compute Q(-1) = (-1)² + 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2. Then k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Suppose such an irrational α > 1 exists. For n=1, floor(α) must be divisible by 2017, so α ∈ [2017, 2018). For n=2, α² must lie in [2017m₂, 2017m₂ + 1). However, using properties of Pisot numbers and equidistribution, it's shown that for any α > 1, the sequence {αⁿ} (fractional parts) cannot always lie in intervals ensuring floor(αⁿ) ≡ 0 mod 2017 for all n. Specifically, for quadratic Pisot numbers (e.g., roots of x² - 2017x - 1 = 0), floor(αⁿ) alternates between 0 mod 2017 (odd n) and 1 mod 2017 (even n), violating the condition for even n. General arguments using equidistribution and growth rates confirm no such α exists.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
