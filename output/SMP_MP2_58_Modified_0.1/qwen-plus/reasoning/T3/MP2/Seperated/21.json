Find $100 m+n$. Instead of computing the sum of all possible totals and the associated $100m + n$, simply find $k = z - 2$, where $z$ is the common value taken by the two equal variables in the solution where exactly two of the variables are equal."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We analyze the system where exactly two variables are equal. By setting x = y ≠ z and solving the equations, we find that the common value of the two equal variables is 3 (e.g., x = y = 3, z = -1/3). The problem defines k = z - 2 where z is this common value, so k = 3 - 2 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The polygons ICAO (4-gon), VENTI (5-gon), and ALBEDO (6-gon) share vertices. The key is that the square (4-gon) and hexagon (6-gon) share edge AO, leading to gcd(4, 6) = 2 distinct configurations due to rotational symmetries. Each configuration results in a unique ON distance, giving 2 possible values.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\"\n}",
