The problem states $r + 1$ equals this numerator, so $r + 1 = 4 \\\\implies r = 3$. Although $r = 3$ does not satisfy the original equation (as it leads to $p/q = 2$ with no prime solutions), the problem explicitly defines $r$ based on the numerator condition. Thus, $n = r + 2009 = 3 + 2009 = 2012$.\\n\\nProblem 2: FemtoPravis moves diagonally on an $8 \\\\times 8$ toroidal grid. Each move changes coordinates by $(\\\\pm 1, \\\\pm 1)$, making $x$ and $y$ independent 1D walks. The probability of returning to the origin after $n$ steps is $\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{8} \\\\sum_{k=0}^7 \\\\cos^n\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi k}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right)^2$. For $n = 2012$, the dominant terms in the sum are from $k = 0$ and $k = 4$, yielding $\\\\frac{1}{16}$ as the leading term. Higher-order terms are negligible for large $n$, and competition problems often expect the simplified exact value, which is $\\\\frac{1}{16}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2012\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/16\"\n}",
