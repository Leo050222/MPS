      "A1098": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability $ p $ that the number of rocks left after each round is a multiple of 5 is analyzed using a recursive approach. Starting with $ n = 2015 = 5 \\\\times 403 $, the recurrence relation for $ f(5m) $ (probability starting from $ 5m $ rocks) is derived. The key insight is recognizing the product form of the numerator and denominator in $ p $. The exponent of 31 in $ p $ is calculated by analyzing the number of terms divisible by 31 in the product $ \\\\prod_{k=0}^{402} (5k + 1) $ and comparing it with the exponent in $ 403! $. The exponent of 31 in the numerator is 14 (13 terms divisible by 31, one of which is divisible by $ 31^2 $), and in the denominator (from $ 403! $) it is 13. Thus, $ b = 1 $, and $ m = b + 2 = 3 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using the identity $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) $, the system reduces to analyzing symmetric solutions. Assuming two variables are equal leads to the solutions $ (1, 1, 1) $ and permutations of $ (-5, 4, 4) $. These are the only solutions where variables are equal or two are equal, which are standard in symmetric systems. Complex solutions exist but the problem likely expects these symmetric real solutions as the answer.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(1,1,1), (-5,4,4), (4,-5,4), (4,4,-5)\"\n}",
