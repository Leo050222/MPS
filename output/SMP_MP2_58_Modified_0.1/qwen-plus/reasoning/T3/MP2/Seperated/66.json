However, the two dice are not fair, meaning that they can land on each face with different probability. Marisa rolls the two dice and calculates their sum. Given that the sum is 2 with probability 0.04, and 12 with probability 0.01, the maximum possible probability of the sum being 7 is $p$. Compute $\\lfloor 100 p\\rfloor$."

For $a$ to be a positive integer, $r - 1$ must divide $r^2$. Rewriting $r^2 = (r - 1)(r + 1) + 1$, we see $r - 1$ divides 1. Thus, $r - 1 = \\\\pm 1$, giving $r = 2$ (since $r = 0$ yields $a = 0$, invalid). For $r = 2$, $a = 4$. Hence, $k = a + 7 = 11$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let $p_i$ be the probability of rolling $i$ on a die. Given $p_1^2 = 0.04 \\\\implies p_1 = 0.2$ and $p_6^2 = 0.01 \\\\implies p_6 = 0.1$. The sum 7 probability is $2(p_1p_6 + p_2p_5 + p_3p_4)$. With $p_1 + p_6 = 0.3$, the remaining probability $0.7$ is split among $p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5$. To maximize $p_2p_5 + p_3p_4$, set either $p_2 = p_5 = 0.35$ (and $p_3 = p_4 = 0$) or vice versa. This gives $p_2p_5 + p_3p_4 = 0.1225$. Thus, the sum 7 probability is $2(0.02 + 0.1225) = 0.285$. Therefore, $\\\\lfloor 100 \\\\times 0.285 \\\\rfloor = 28$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"28\"\n}",
