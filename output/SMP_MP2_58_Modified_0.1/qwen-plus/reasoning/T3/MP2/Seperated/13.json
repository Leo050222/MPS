Find the number of anti-palindromes less than $3^{12}$ such that no two consecutive digits in base 3 are equal. Instead of determining the total count of qualifying anti-palindromes, simply find $k = b_1 + 27$, where $b_1$ is the number of valid anti-palindromes with one digit derived from the anti-palindrome condition and the no consecutive equal digits constraint."

The no consecutive digits condition is vacuously true for a single digit, so $b_1 = 1$. Thus, $k = 1 + 27 = 28$.\\n\\nProblem 2: A valid arrangement of ten numbers around a circle where each number is one more than the gcd of its neighbors is $[2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3]$. Verifying each position confirms the condition holds. The sum of these numbers is $2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 28$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"28\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"28\"\n}",
