Considering opposite signs (since $n$ is positive, $m$ must be negative), let $m = -k$ ($k > 0$). Substituting gives $k^5 + n^5 = 16kn$. Testing small values, $k = 2$, $n = 2$ satisfies the equation: $2^5 + 2^5 = 32 + 32 = 64 = 16 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 2$. Thus, $(m, n) = (-2, 2)$ is a solution with opposite signs. Here, $n = 2$, so $k = n - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given polynomial $x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48$ with roots $p < q < r$, we use Vieta's formulas: $pqr = 48$. To minimize $\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$, we apply Lagrange multipliers under the constraint $pqr = 48$. Solving yields $q = 2p$, $r = 3p$, leading to $6p^3 = 48 \\\\Rightarrow p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$. The expression evaluates to $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{3}{2}$, confirmed as the minimum by testing other factorizations and verifying critical points.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
