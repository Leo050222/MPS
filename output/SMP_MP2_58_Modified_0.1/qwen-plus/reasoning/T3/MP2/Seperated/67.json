Verification shows that n = 2019 satisfies φ(2019n) = φ(n²), confirming gcd(2019, n) = 2019.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using the recurrence relation and defining t = a₂ + 1, the sequence terms follow a pattern: aₙ = (t^{n-1} - 2^{n-2}) / 2^{n-2} for n ≥ 3. Given a₉ = 7, solving (t⁸ - 128)/128 = 7 gives t⁸ = 1024, so t⁴ = 32. Thus, a₅ = (32 - 8)/8 = 3.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
