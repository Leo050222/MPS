By computing terms, a pattern emerges where after initial terms, the sequence stabilizes into runs of primes. For primes p ≥ 7, each prime p appears exactly 6 times. Tracking cumulative terms, the 100th term (a₁₀₀) falls within the run of the prime 61 (terms 95–100). The two terms immediately preceding a₁₀₀ are a₉₈ and a₉₉, both 61. Their sum is 61 + 61 = 122.\\n\\nProblem 2: Alice starts at 0 and applies 100 operations (add 1 or square). To maximize the minimal distance to the nearest perfect square, the optimal strategy involves reaching a number N = s² + t where t is maximized such that t ≤ s and operations allow it. The maximum score is achieved by reaching s = 256 in 5 operations (2 additions, 3 squares), squaring to 65536 (operation 6), then adding 94 times (operations 7–100) to get N = 65630. The minimal distance to the nearest square (65536) is 94, which is the maximum possible score.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"122\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"94\"\n}",
