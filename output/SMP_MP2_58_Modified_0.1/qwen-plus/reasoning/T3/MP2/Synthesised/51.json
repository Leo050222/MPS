  "math_problem": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form. Determine all the roots, real or complex, of the system of simultaneous equations $x + y + z = m$, $x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = m$, $x^{m} + y^{m} + z^{m} = m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main parts. First, determining the probability $ p $ that the number of rocks left after each round is a multiple of 5, starting from 2015 rocks. This leads to analyzing a recursive probability process where each step reduces the pile by a multiple of 5. The recurrence relation for the probability $ f(t) $ starting from $ 5t $ rocks is derived as $ f(t) = \\\\frac{5t - 4}{5t} f(t-1) $, leading to $ f(403) = \\\\prod_{k=1}^{403} \\\\frac{5k - 4}{5k} $. Analyzing the exponents of 5 and 31 in this product shows the exponent of 31 in $ p $ is $ b = 1 $. Thus, $ m = b + 2 = 3 $.\\n\\nNext, solving the system $ x + y + z = 3 $, $ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3 $, $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 $. Using symmetric sums, the polynomial with roots $ x, y, z $ is $ t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t - 1 = (t - 1)^3 $, indicating all roots are $ 1 $ (triple root).\",\n    \"answer\": \"1, 1, 1\"\n}",
