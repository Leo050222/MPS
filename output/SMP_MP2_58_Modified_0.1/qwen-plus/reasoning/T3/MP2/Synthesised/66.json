  "math_problem": "For how many positive integers $a$ does the polynomial $x^{2}-a x+a$ have an integer root? Instead of counting the positive integers $a$ such that the given quadratic polynomial has an integer root, simply find $k = a + 7$, where $a$ is a positive integer such that $x^{2} - a x + a$ has an integer root. Marisa has two identical cubical dice labeled with the numbers \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\). However, the two dice are not fair, meaning that they can land on each face with different probability. Marisa rolls the two dice and calculates their sum. Given that the sum is 2 with probability 0.04, and 12 with probability 0.01, the maximum possible probability of the sum being $k$ is $p$. Compute $\\lfloor 100 p \\rfloor$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, solve for positive integers $a$ such that $x^2 - ax + a$ has an integer root. Let $r$ be an integer root, then $r^2 - ar + a = 0 \\\\implies a = \\\\frac{r^2}{r - 1}$. For $a$ to be a positive integer, $r - 1$ must divide $r^2$. Simplifying, $\\\\frac{r^2}{r - 1} = r + 1 + \\\\frac{1}{r - 1}$, so $r - 1$ must divide 1. Thus, $r - 1 = \\\\pm 1$. $r = 2$ gives $a = 4$ (valid), $r = 0$ gives $a = 0$ (invalid). Hence, $a = 4$, so $k = a + 7 = 11$.\\n\\nNext, consider two identical dice with probabilities $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_6$. Given $p_1^2 = 0.04 \\\\implies p_1 = 0.2$ and $p_6^2 = 0.01 \\\\implies p_6 = 0.1$. The sum $k = 11$ occurs for $(5,6)$ and $(6,5)$, so probability is $2p_5p_6$. To maximize this, maximize $p_5$ given $p_1 + p_6 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 = 1$. The remaining probability is $1 - 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.7$, so set $p_2 = p_3 = p_4 = 0$, $p_5 = 0.7$. Then the probability is $2 \\\\times 0.7 \\\\times 0.1 = 0.14$. Thus, $\\\\lfloor 100 \\\\times 0.14 \\\\rfloor = 14$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"14\"\n}",
