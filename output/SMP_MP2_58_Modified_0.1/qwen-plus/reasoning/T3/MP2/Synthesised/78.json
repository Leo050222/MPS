  "math_problem": "Let $Q(x)=x^{2}+2x+3$, and suppose that $P(x)$ is a polynomial such that $P(Q(x))=x^{6}+6x^{5}+18x^{4}+32x^{3}+35x^{2}+22x+8$. Compute $P(2)$. Instead of computing $P(2)$, simply find $k = Q(r) - 1$, where $r$ is the unique real root of the derivative of $Q$. Does there exist an irrational number $\\alpha>k$ such that $\\left\\lfloor\\alpha^{n}\\right\\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod 2017)$ for all integers $n \\geq k$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find the derivative of Q(x) = x² + 2x + 3, which is Q'(x) = 2x + 2. The unique real root r is where 2x + 2 = 0, so r = -1. Compute Q(r) = (-1)² + 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2. Thus, k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. \\n\\nNext, determine if there exists an irrational α > 1 such that floor(αⁿ) ≡ 0 mod 2017 for all n ≥ 1. Consider α = 2017 + ε where ε is a small positive irrational number (e.g., ε = √2 / 2017^N for large N). For each n ≥ 1, αⁿ = (2017 + ε)^n. Expanding via the binomial theorem, all terms except the last (εⁿ) contain at least one factor of 2017, making their sum a multiple of 2017. Since ε < 1, εⁿ < 1, so floor(αⁿ) equals the multiple of 2017, hence divisible by 2017. By choosing ε sufficiently small (to ensure the sum of non-2017 terms remains less than 1 for all n), such an α exists and is irrational. Thus, the answer is yes.\",\n    \"answer\": \"yes\"\n}",
