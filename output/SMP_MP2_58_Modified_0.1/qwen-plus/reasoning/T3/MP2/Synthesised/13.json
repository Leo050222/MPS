Find the number of anti-palindromes less than $3^{12}$ such that no two consecutive digits in base 3 are equal. Instead of determining the total count of qualifying anti-palindromes, simply find $k = b_1 + 27$, where $b_1$ is the number of valid anti-palindromes with one digit derived from the anti-palindrome condition and the no consecutive equal digits constraint. Ten positive integers are arranged around a circle. Each number is one more than the greatest common divisor of its two neighbors. What is the sum of the ten numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"An anti-palindrome in base 3 with one digit (n=0) must satisfy $a_0 + a_0 = 2$, leading to $a_0 = 1$. The no consecutive digits constraint is vacuously true for a single digit. Thus, $b_1 = 1$. Calculating $k = b_1 + 27 = 1 + 27 = 28$.\",\n    \"answer\": \"28\"\n}",
