  "math_problem": "A rubber band is 4 inches long. An ant begins at the left end. Every minute, the ant walks one inch along rightwards along the rubber band, but then the band is stretched (uniformly) by one inch. For what value of $n$ will the ant reach the right end during the $n$th minute? Instead of determining the minute during which the ant reaches the right end, simply find $p$, where $p$ is the portion of the rubber band's length traversed by the ant during the first minute accounting for the uniform stretch. Let $s = p + \\frac{23}{4}$. $s$ students taking a test sit in a row of seats with aisles only on the two sides of the row. If they finish the test at random times, what is the probability that some student will have to pass by another student to get to an aisle?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, determine $ p $, the portion of the rubber band traversed by the ant during the first minute. Initially, the rubber band is 4 inches long. The ant walks 1 inch, which is $ \\\\frac{1}{4} $ of the band's length. After stretching uniformly to 5 inches, the ant's position scales proportionally, but the fraction of the band traversed remains $ \\\\frac{1}{4} $. Thus, $ p = \\\\frac{1}{4} $. \\n\\nNext, compute $ s = p + \\\\frac{23}{4} = \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{23}{4} = 6 $. \\n\\nFor $ s = 6 $ students in a row, the probability that some student must pass another to reach an aisle is calculated. The total permutations of finishing times is $ 6! = 720 $. The number of permutations where no student needs to pass (all can exit via an aisle without obstruction) is $ 2^{n-1} = 2^5 = 32 $. Thus, the probability of no obstruction is $ \\\\frac{32}{720} = \\\\frac{2}{45} $. The desired probability is $ 1 - \\\\frac{2}{45} = \\\\frac{43}{45} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"43/45\"\n}",
