  "math_problem": "Find all positive integers $n$ such that: \n\\[\n\\dfrac{n^3+3}{n^2+7}\n\\]\nis a positive integer. Instead of finding all positive integers making the given rational expression a positive integer, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the positive integer such that for each such positive integer, it equals the value of the expression plus $k$. Find all the values of $m$ for which the zeros of $2 x^{2}-m x-8$ differ by $|m - k|$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find positive integers $ n $ such that $ \\\\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7} $ is a positive integer. Rewrite the expression as $ n - \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $. For this to be an integer, $ n^2 + 7 $ must divide $ 7n - 3 $. Since $ n^2 + 7 \\\\leq 7n - 3 $ for positive integers $ n $, solving $ n^2 - 7n + 10 \\\\leq 0 $ gives $ n = 2, 3, 4, 5 $. Testing these, only $ n = 2 $ (yields 1) and $ n = 5 $ (yields 4) work. For both, $ k = n - \\\\text{expression value} = 1 $. \\n\\nNext, find $ m $ such that the zeros of $ 2x^2 - mx - 8 $ differ by $ |m - 1| $. The difference of roots is $ \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{m^2 + 64}}{2} $. Setting equal to $ |m - 1| $, squaring gives $ 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0 $. Solving yields $ m = 6 $ and $ m = -\\\\frac{10}{3} $, both valid upon verification.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6, -10/3\"\n}",
