  "math_problem": "Teresa the bunny has a fair 8-sided die. Seven of its sides have fixed labels $1,2, \\\\ldots, 7$, and the label on the eighth side can be changed and begins as 1. She rolls it several times, until each of $1,2, \\\\ldots, 7$ appears at least once. After each roll, if $k$ is the smallest positive integer that she has not rolled so far, she relabels the eighth side with $k$. The probability that 7 is the last number she rolls is $\\\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the specified linear combination from the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process, simply find $m = q_0 + 3999/4$, where $q_0$ is the probability that the highest fixed label is the last new label obtained in the rolling process derived from the recursive probability analysis of the states based on the number of distinct fixed labels collected. Let $N$ be the number of triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ satisfying $a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c, \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b, c)=1, \\\\quad a b c=6^{2020}$. Compute the remainder when $N$ is divided by $m$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two main components: determining the value of $ m $ and computing the number of valid triples $ N $, then finding $ N \\\\mod m $.\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine $ q_0 $\\n\\nTeresa's process involves rolling an 8-sided die with fixed labels $ 1, 2, \\\\ldots, 7 $ and a dynamic eighth side relabeled to the smallest missing label. The goal is to find the probability $ q_0 $ that 7 is the last new label collected.\\n\\nThis is a variant of the coupon collector problem where the probability of collecting the smallest missing label is higher due to the dynamic relabeling. Using recursive analysis:\\n\\n- Let $ p_t $ be the probability of success (collecting all labels $ 1 $ through $ 6 $ before $ 7 $) starting with $ t $ labels collected from $ \\\\{1, \\\\ldots, 6\\\\} $.\\n- The recurrence relation is $ p_t = \\\\frac{7 - t}{8 - t} \\\\cdot p_{t+1} $, with $ p_6 = 1 $.\\n- Solving recursively:\\n  - $ p_5 = \\\\frac{2}{3} $\\n  - $ p_4 = \\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{2}{3} = \\\\frac{1}{2} $\\n  - $ p_3 = \\\\frac{4}{5} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{2}{5} $\\n  - $ p_2 = \\\\frac{5}{6} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{2}{5} = \\\\frac{1}{3} $\\n  - $ p_1 = \\\\frac{6}{7} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{3} = \\\\frac{2}{7} $\\n  - $ p_0 = \\\\frac{7}{8} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{2}{7} = \\\\frac{1}{4} $\\n\\nThus, $ q_0 = \\\\frac{1}{4} $.\\n\\n### Step 2: Compute $ m $\\n\\nGiven $ m = q_0 + \\\\frac{3999}{4} $:\\n$$\\nm = \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{3999}{4} = \\\\frac{4000}{4} = 1000\\n$$\\n\\n### Step 3: Compute $ N $\\n\\nWe need the number of triples $ (a, b, c) $ with $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c $, $ \\\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1 $, and $ abc = 6^{2020} $.\\n\\n- $ 6^{2020} = 2^{2020} \\\\cdot 3^{2020} $.\\n- For each prime, the number of ordered triples $ (x_1, x_2, x_3) $ with $ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 2020 $ and $ \\\\min(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 0 $ is $ 3 \\\\times 2020 = 6060 $.\\n- Total ordered triples with $ \\\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1 $: $ 6060^2 $.\\n- Using Burnside's lemma to count unordered triples $ a \\\\leq b \\\\leq c $:\\n  - Identity: $ 6060^2 $\\n  - Transpositions (e.g., $ a = b $): 4 valid cases per transposition, 3 transpositions $ \\\\Rightarrow 3 \\\\times 4 = 12 $\\n  - 3-cycles: 0 (since $ 2020 $ is not divisible by 3)\\n  - $ N = \\\\frac{6060^2 + 12}{6} = \\\\frac{36723600 + 12}{6} = 6120602 $\\n\\n### Step 4: Compute $ N \\\\mod m $\\n\\n- $ N = 6120602 $\\n- $ m = 1000 $\\n- $ 6120602 \\\\mod 1000 = 602 $\", \"answer\": \"602\"}",
