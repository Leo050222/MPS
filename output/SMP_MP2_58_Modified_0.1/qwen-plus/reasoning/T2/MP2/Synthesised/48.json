  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Instead of determining the number of partitions of the set into pairs that form a single cell, simply find $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game. What is the probability that exactly $k$ games will need to be played to determine a winner?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding the probability that exactly k games are played in a best-of-9 series, where k = n + 5 and n is the cardinality of set A admitting a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A consistent 2-configuration with exactly 1 cell (a single pair) implies the set A has 2 elements (n = 2), so k = 2 + 5 = 7. For a best-of-9 series where the first team to 5 wins wins the series, exactly 7 games are played if one team wins the 7th game and has exactly 4 wins in the first 6 games. The Mathletes (probability 2/3 per game) contribute C(6,4)*(2/3)^5*(1/3)^2, and the other team contributes C(6,2)*(2/3)^2*(1/3)^5. Summing these gives 15*(32 + 4)/3^7 = 540/2187 = 20/81.\",\n    \"answer\": \"20/81\"\n}",
