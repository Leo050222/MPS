  "math_problem": "Compute all ordered triples $(x, y, z)$ of real numbers satisfying the following system of equations: $$\\begin{aligned} x y+z & =40 \\\\\\\\ x z+y & =51 \\\\\\\\ x+y+z & =19 \\end{aligned}$$ Instead of computing all ordered triples of real numbers satisfying the system of equations, simply find $k = z + \\frac{17}{5}$, where $z$ is the third component in the solution corresponding to the smaller root for $x + 1$ among the roots of the quadratic equation derived from the system. There are 21 competitors with distinct skill levels numbered $1,2, \\ldots, 21$. They participate in a pingpong tournament as follows. First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill $k$. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the system of equations:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\nxy + z &= 40 \\\\\\\\\\nxz + y &= 51 \\\\\\\\\\nx + y + z &= 19\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nWe aim to find all ordered triples $(x, y, z)$ of real numbers satisfying this system. From the third equation, we can express $z = 19 - x - y$. Substituting into the first two equations yields:\\n\\n- $xy + (19 - x - y) = 40 \\\\Rightarrow xy - x - y = 21 \\\\Rightarrow (x - 1)(y - 1) = 22$\\n- $x(19 - x - y) + y = 51 \\\\Rightarrow 19x - x^2 - xy + y = 51$\\n\\nFrom the first derived equation, we solve for $y$ in terms of $x$:  \\n$$\\ny = \\\\frac{x + 21}{x - 1}\\n$$\\n\\nSubstitute into the second equation and simplify to obtain a quadratic in $x$:\\n$$\\nx^2 - 18x + 72 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nSolving gives roots $x = 6$ and $x = 12$. For each root, compute corresponding $y$ and $z$:\\n\\n- If $x = 6$, then $y = \\\\frac{27}{5}$, $z = \\\\frac{38}{5}$\\n- If $x = 12$, then $y = 3$, $z = 4$\\n\\nThe problem specifies that we are to consider the solution corresponding to the **smaller root for $x + 1$**. Since $x = 6$ gives $x + 1 = 7$, and $x = 12$ gives $x + 1 = 13$, the smaller is $x = 6$, so $z = \\\\frac{38}{5}$.\\n\\nNow compute:\\n$$\\nk = z + \\\\frac{17}{5} = \\\\frac{38}{5} + \\\\frac{17}{5} = \\\\frac{55}{5} = 11\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\nNext, we analyze the pingpong tournament with 21 players having distinct skill levels from 1 to 21. Alice has skill level $k = 11$. The tournament proceeds as follows:\\n\\n- One player is randomly chosen as \\\"active\\\".\\n- In each round, a random inactive player is selected to play against the current active player.\\n- The winner becomes (or remains) active; the loser is eliminated.\\n- After 20 rounds, only one player remains.\\n\\nWe are asked to compute the **expected number of games Alice plays**, given her skill level is 11.\\n\\nThis is a classic problem in probability involving a **randomized elimination tournament** where the active player always wins against lower-skilled opponents. A key insight is that for any player with skill $s$, the expected number of games they play depends on how many players have higher and lower skills than them.\\n\\nLet:\\n- $l = 10$ be the number of players with skill less than 11 (skills 1 through 10)\\n- $h = 10$ be the number of players with skill greater than 11 (skills 12 through 21)\\n- $n = 21$ total players\\n\\nA known result in such tournaments states that the **expected number of games** a player plays is:\\n$$\\nE[X] = \\\\frac{2(l + 1)}{n}\\n$$\\n\\nThis formula arises from symmetry and linearity of expectation: the player will be active or chosen as an opponent in a predictable proportion of rounds based on their relative skill ranking.\\n\\nSubstituting values:\\n$$\\nE[X] = \\\\frac{2(10 + 1)}{21} = \\\\frac{22}{21}\\n$$\", \"answer\": \"22/21\"}",
