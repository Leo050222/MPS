  "math_problem": "Eight points are chosen on the circumference of a circle, labelled $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{8}$ in clockwise order. A route is a sequence of at least two points $P_{a_{1}}, P_{a_{2}}, \\ldots, P_{a_{n}}$ such that if an ant were to visit these points in their given order, starting at $P_{a_{1}}$ and ending at $P_{a_{n}}$, by following $n-1$ straight line segments (each connecting each $P_{a_{i}}$ and $P_{a_{i+1}}$ ), it would never visit a point twice or cross its own path. Find the number of routes. Instead of determining the total number of such routes, simply find $k = r - 1092$, where $r$ is the number of valid routes starting from the designated point $P_8$. Let $A B C D E F G H$ be an equilateral octagon with $\\angle A \\cong \\angle C \\cong \\angle E \\cong \\angle G$ and $\\angle B \\cong \\angle D \\cong \\angle F \\cong \\angle H$. If the area of $A B C D E F G H$ is three times the area of $A C E G$, then $\\sin B$ can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m, n$ are positive integers and $\\gcd(m, n)=k$. Find $100 m+n$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"The problem involves two parts. First, determining $ k = r - 1092 $, where $ r $ is the number of valid routes starting from $ P_8 $ on a circle with 8 points. A valid route is a sequence of at least two points with no repeated points and no crossing paths.\\n\\nFor $ n $ points on a circle, the number of non-crossing routes starting at a fixed point is given by $ \\\\frac{3^{n-1} - 1}{2} $. For $ n = 8 $, this becomes:\\n$$\\nr = \\\\frac{3^7 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{2187 - 1}{2} = 1093\\n$$\\nThus, $ k = r - 1092 = 1093 - 1092 = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, consider the equilateral octagon $ ABCDEFGH $ with $ \\\\angle A \\\\cong \\\\angle C \\\\cong \\\\angle E \\\\cong \\\\angle G $ and $ \\\\angle B \\\\cong \\\\angle D \\\\cong \\\\angle F \\\\cong \\\\angle H $. Let $ \\\\beta = \\\\angle B $. The sum of interior angles for an octagon is $ 1080^\\\\circ $, so $ 4\\\\alpha + 4\\\\beta = 1080^\\\\circ $, giving $ \\\\alpha + \\\\beta = 270^\\\\circ $.\\n\\nUsing coordinate geometry and the shoelace formula, the area of the octagon is $ 2(1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta + \\\\sin \\\\beta)s^2 $ and the area of quadrilateral $ ACEG $ is $ 2(1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta)s^2 $. Given the octagon's area is three times $ ACEG $'s area:\\n$$\\n1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta + \\\\sin \\\\beta = 3(1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta)\\n$$\\nSimplifying gives $ \\\\sin \\\\beta = 2(1 - \\\\cos \\\\beta) $. Substituting $ \\\\sin^2 \\\\beta + \\\\cos^2 \\\\beta = 1 $ yields $ \\\\cos \\\\beta = \\\\frac{3}{5} $ and $ \\\\sin \\\\beta = \\\\frac{4}{5} $. Thus, $ \\\\sin B = \\\\frac{4}{5} $, where $ m = 4 $, $ n = 5 $, and $ \\\\gcd(4, 5) = 1 = k $.\\n\\nFinally, $ 100m + n = 100 \\\\cdot 4 + 5 = 405 $.\", \"answer\": \"405\"}",
