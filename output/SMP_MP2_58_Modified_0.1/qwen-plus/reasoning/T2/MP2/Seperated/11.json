      "A1433": "During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^{2}$. Instead of determining the real part of the square of the starting point, simply find $k = |z| - 1$, where $|z|$ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days."

      "A1487": "Bob's Rice ID number has six digits, each a number from 1 to 9, and any digit can be used any number of times. The ID number satisfies the following property: the first two digits is a number divisible by 2, the first three digits is a number divisible by 3, etc. so that the ID number itself is divisible by 6. One ID number that satisfies this condition is 123252. How many different possibilities are there for Bob's ID number?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The total path lengths on both days are equal to √2012. For Saturday, the total path length is |z² - 1| * r * (1 - r²⁰¹²)/(1 - r²), and for Sunday, it is |z² - 1| * (1 - r²⁰¹²)/(1 - r²). Setting them equal gives r = 1. Thus, |z| = 1, so k = |z| - 1 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: The ID number must satisfy divisibility conditions for each prefix. Key steps: d5=5 (divisible by 5), d2 even (divisible by 2), d3d4 divisible by 4 (18 valid pairs), and d6 even with sum divisible by 3. For each (d3,d4) pair, there are 12 valid (d1,d2) combinations (due to uniform residue distribution). Counting d6 choices based on d4 mod 3: 5 pairs with 1 choice, 4 pairs with 1 choice, 9 pairs with 2 choices, totaling 27. Total IDs: 12 * 27 = 324.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"324\"\n}",
