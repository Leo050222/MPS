For a single pair, the set size $ n $ must be 2. Thus, $ k = n + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7 $. Problem 2: For exactly 7 games to determine a winner, the series must reach 4-2 after 6 games, then the 7th game decides the winner. The Mathletes win in 7 games if they win 4 of the first 6 games and then the 7th: $ \\\\binom{6}{4} \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\right)^5 \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right)^2 $. The opponent wins similarly: $ \\\\binom{6}{4} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right)^5 \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\right)^2 $.
