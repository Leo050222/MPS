The central angles must sum to 2π. By symmetry and optimization, the largest minimum central angle is π/3, leading to a sector area of (π/3)/2 = π/6. Thus, a=1, b=6. The problem asks for k = b + 4 = 10.\\n\\nProblem 2: Check integers greater than 10. For N=153, base 10 digit sum is 1+5+3=9. In base 17, 153 = 9×17 + 0, so digits are [9,0] with sum 9+0=9. This is the smallest such number.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"153\"\n}",
