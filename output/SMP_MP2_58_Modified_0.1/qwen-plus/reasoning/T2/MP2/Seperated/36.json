A route is a sequence of at least two points $P_{a_{1}}, P_{a_{2}}, \\ldots, P_{a_{n}}$ such that if an ant were to visit these points in their given order, starting at $P_{a_{1}}$ and ending at $P_{a_{n}}$, by following $n-1$ straight line segments (each connecting each $P_{a_{i}}$ and $P_{a_{i+1}}$ ), it would never visit a point twice or cross its own path. Find the number of routes. Instead of determining the total number of such routes, simply find $k = r - 1092$, where $r$ is the number of valid routes starting from the designated point $P_8$."

For 8 points (m=7), r = (3^7 - 1)/2 = 1093. Thus, k = r - 1092 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using coordinate geometry and the shoelace formula, the area condition leads to sin β = 2(1 - cos β). Solving with sin²β + cos²β = 1 gives sin β = 4/5. Thus, m=4, n=5, and 100m + n = 405.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"405\"\n}",
