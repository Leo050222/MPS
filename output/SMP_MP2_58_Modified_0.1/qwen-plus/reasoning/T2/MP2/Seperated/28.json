First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill 11. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?"

Substituting $ z = 40 - xy $ from the first equation into this gives $ y(1 - x) = -x - 21 $, so $ y = \\\\frac{x + 21}{x - 1} $. Similarly, from the second equation, $ y = \\\\frac{51 - 40x}{1 - x^2} $. Equating these expressions for $ y $ and simplifying leads to the quadratic equation $ x^2 - 18x + 72 = 0 $, with roots $ x = 6 $ and $ x = 12 $. The smaller root for $ x + 1 $ is $ 7 $ (corresponding to $ x = 6 $). For $ x = 6 $, solving gives $ y = \\\\frac{27}{5} $ and $ z = \\\\frac{38}{5} $. Thus, $ k = z + \\\\frac{17}{5} = \\\\frac{38}{5} + \\\\frac{17}{5} = \\\\frac{55}{5} = 11 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: In a tournament with 21 players, Alice (skill 11) is the median. Due to symmetry between players below and above her skill level, her expected number of games equals the average number of games per player. The total number of games is 20 (since 20 rounds eliminate 20 players), so total player-games is $ 2 \\\\times 20 = 40 $. With 21 players, the average is $ \\\\frac{40}{21} $. By symmetry, Alice's expected games equal this average.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"40/21\"\n}",
