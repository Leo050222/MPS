Since f(2) is integer, f(2) must be a multiple of 3: let f(2)=3t. Then f(3)=4t.\\nCondition (3) for n=1: f(2) < 6 f(1) ⇒ 3t < 6 ⇒ t<2 ⇒ t=1. So f(2)=3, f(3)=4.\\n\\nNow n=2 in (2):\\n3 f(2) f(5) = f(4) (1 + 3 f(2))\\nLeft: 3·3·f(5)=9 f(5). Right: f(4)(1+9)=10 f(4).\\nSo 9 f(5)=10 f(4). Thus 10 f(4) multiple of 9. Let f(4)=9s, then f(5)=10s.\\nCondition (3) for n=2: f(4) < 6 f(2) ⇒ 9s < 6·3=18 ⇒ 9s<18 ⇒ s<2 ⇒ s=1.\\nSo f(4)=9, f(5)=10.\\n\\nInductive pattern appears: from (2), if we write f(2n)=A, f(2n+1)=B and know f(n)=x, then\\n3 x·B = A(1+3x) ⇒ B = A(1+3x)/(3x).\\nTo keep B integer, A must be chosen compatible. Condition (3): A=f(2n) < 6x.\\nWe already see for n=1 we forced the smallest multiple to satisfy inequality; similarly for n=2. We hypothesize f(n)=n for all n.\\n\\nCheck that f(n)=n satisfies all conditions:\\n(1) f(1)=1 holds.\\n(3) f(2n)=2n, f(n)=n, so f(2n)=2n<6n=6 f(n) holds for all n≥1.\\n(2) LHS: 3 f(n) f(2n+1)=3 n(2n+1). RHS: f(2n) (1+3 f(n)) = 2n(1+3n)=2n+6n^2.\\nCompute LHS: 3n(2n+1)=6n^2+3n. RHS: 2n+6n^2. They match: 6n^2+3n=6n^2+2n? Wait they do not; check carefully:\\nLHS=3n(2n+1)=6n^2+3n.\\nRHS=2n(1+3n)=2n+6n^2.\\nEquality requires 6n^2+3n = 6n^2+2n ⇒ 3n=2n ⇒ n=0, which is not in N. So f(n)=n does NOT satisfy (2). So discard that.\\n\\nWe must be more careful: we actually solved for small n using the functional equation itself, not assuming linearity.\\nWith n=1: f(2)=3, f(3)=4.\\nWith n=2: f(4)=9, f(5)=10.\\nNow n=3: 3 f(3) f(7) = f(6)(1 + 3 f(3)) ⇒ 3·4·f(7)=f(6)(1+12)=13 f(6) ⇒ 12 f(7)=13 f(6).\\nLet f(6)=12u, then f(7)=13u. Condition (3) for n=3: f(6) < 6 f(3) ⇒ 12u < 6·4=24 ⇒ u<2 ⇒ u=1. So f(6)=12, f(7)=13.\\nNext n=4: 3 f(4) f(9) = f(8)(1+3 f(4)). 3·9·f(9)=f(8)(1+27)=28 f(8). So 27 f(9)=28 f(8). Let f(8)=27v ⇒ f(9)=28v. Condition (3) for n=4: f(8) < 6 f(4) ⇒ 27v < 6·9=54 ⇒ v<2 ⇒ v=1. So f(8)=27, f(9)=28.\\nWe see a clear pattern:\\nFor n=1: (f(2),f(3))=(3,4) = (3·1,4·1)\\nFor n=2: (f(4),f(5))=(9,10)=(3·3,4·3)\\nFor n=3: (f(6),f(7))=(12,13)=(3·4,4·4)\\nFor n=4: (f(8),f(9))=(27,28)=(3·9,4·9)\\nSo apparently f(2n)=3 f(n), f(2n+1)=4 f(n) for these cases. Let's prove this.\\n\\nStep 2: Prove general formula.\\nFrom (2): 3 f(n) f(2n+1) = f(2n)(1+3 f(n)).\\nSuppose f(2n)=3 f(n) for some n. Then RHS = 3 f(n)(1+3 f(n)), so\\n3 f(n) f(2n+1)=3 f(n)(1+3 f(n)) ⇒ f(2n+1)=1+3 f(n).\\nBut from computed values:\\nFor n=1: f(2)=3 f(1)=3, f(3)=1+3·1=4.\\nFor n=2: f(4)=3 f(2)=9, f(5)=1+3·3=10.\\nSo indeed f(2n+1)=1+3 f(n).\\nHowever our observed pattern was f(2n+1)=4 f(n) for these specific n because f(n) happened to equal 1,3,4,9 respectively, and 1+3 f(n)=4 f(n) only for f(n)=1/ (??) Actually 1+3 f(n)=4 f(n) ⇒ 1=f(n), so only holds for n=1. So 4 f(n) was a coincidence with small examples; the correct general relation is:\\nAssume f(2n)=3 f(n). Then (2) gives f(2n+1)=1+3 f(n).\\nWe must justify f(2n)=3 f(n).\\n\\nFrom (2):\\n3 f(n) f(2n+1) = f(2n)(1+3 f(n)).\\nWe also have inequality (3): f(2n) < 6 f(n).\\nSo f(2n) can be written as 3 f(n) − r, with r a positive integer or zero but such that 0 ≤ r < 3 f(n). (Because 0 < f(2n) < 6 f(n). We can set f(2n)=3 f(n)+t with |t|<3 f(n); considering both sign possibilities.) We need more structure.\\nInstead note that the relation can be rearranged:\\n3 f(n) f(2n+1) = f(2n) + 3 f(n) f(2n).\\nSo 3 f(n) [f(2n+1) − f(2n)] = f(2n).\\nThus\\nf(2n) = 3 f(n) [f(2n+1) − f(2n)].\\nSo f(2n) divides 3 f(n) times something. Hard to use directly. Instead, solve (2) for f(2n+1):\\n\\nf(2n+1) = f(2n)(1+3 f(n))/(3 f(n)).\\nFor this to be integer, numerator divisible by 3 f(n). Let g=f(2n). Then need 3 f(n) | g(1+3 f(n)). Write 3 f(n) = d, and consider gcd.\\nLet p = gcd(g,3 f(n)). Then since gcd(1+3 f(n),3 f(n))=1 (clearly, any common divisor would divide 1), we must have 3 f(n) | g. That is, g is a multiple of 3 f(n):\\nBecause d = 3 f(n) divides g(1+3 f(n)), and gcd(d,1+3 f(n))=1, we conclude d | g.\\nTherefore f(2n)=g is divisible by 3 f(n), so f(2n) = 3 f(n) m for some positive integer m.\\nThen inequality (3) gives\\n3 f(n) m = f(2n) < 6 f(n) ⇒ m < 2 ⇒ m=1.\\nTherefore f(2n) = 3 f(n) for all n.\\nPlug this back into (2):\\n3 f(n) f(2n+1) = 3 f(n)(1+3 f(n)) ⇒ f(2n+1)=1+3 f(n) for all n.\\nSo the function is uniquely defined recursively by\\nf(1)=1,\\nf(2n)=3 f(n),\\nf(2n+1)=1+3 f(n).\\nThis satisfies all given conditions, so this is the unique f.\\n\\nStep 3: Express f(n) explicitly.\\nWe can generate f based on the binary representation of n.\\nLet n in binary be b_k b_{k-1} ... b_1 b_0 (b_k =1). We start from f(1)=1 (binary \\\"1\\\"). Each step:\\nIf next bit is 0: n→2n, f→3 f.\\nIf next bit is 1: n→2n+1, f→1+3 f.\\nThus, beginning with value 1 and reading bits of n from left to right after the initial 1, f is a homomorphic evaluation with operations\\nbit 0: x → 3x\\nbit 1: x → 1+3x.\\nWe can just compute values we need rather than closed form.\\n\\nStep 4: Compute range of f(n) up to relevant size.\\nWe want f(k)+f(l)=293. Since f(n) is increasing with n? Not obviously monotone, but f(2n)=3 f(n)>f(n), and f(2n+1)=1+3 f(n)>f(2n), so f is strictly increasing: For each n, f(2n)>f(n) and f(2n+1)>f(2n), and since numbers between 2^m and 2^{m+1}−1 are generated from smaller by monotone operations, we get monotonicity. More directly: consider mapping n→ binary string; longer strings with appending bits via 3x or 1+3x always increase, so lexicographic order of binary equals order of n, and corresponding operations strictly increase; so f is strictly increasing in n.\\nThus to reach sum 293, the larger of f(k), f(l) is at most 292 and minimal value is f(1)=1. We can find all n such that f(n) ≤ 292 and then look for pairs summing to 293.\\n\\nWe compute f(n) recursively for n starting from 1.\\nDefine f(1)=1.\\nThen\\nn=1: f(1)=1\\nn=2: f(2)=3 f(1)=3\\nn=3: f(3)=1+3 f(1)=4\\nn=4: f(4)=3 f(2)=9\\nn=5: f(5)=1+3 f(2)=1+9=10\\nn=6: f(6)=3 f(3)=12\\nn=7: f(7)=1+3 f(3)=1+12=13\\nn=8: f(8)=3 f(4)=27\\nn=9: f(9)=1+3 f(4)=1+27=28\\nn=10: f(10)=3 f(5)=30\\nn=11: f(11)=1+3 f(5)=1+30=31\\nn=12: f(12)=3 f(6)=36\\nn=13: f(13)=1+3 f(6)=1+36=37\\nn=14: f(14)=3 f(7)=39\\nn=15: f(15)=1+3 f(7)=1+39=40\\nn=16: f(16)=3 f(8)=81\\nn=17: f(17)=1+3 f(8)=1+81=82\\nn=18: f(18)=3 f(9)=84\\nn=19: f(19)=1+3 f(9)=1+84=85\\nn=20: f(20)=3 f(10)=90\\nn=21: f(21)=1+3 f(10)=1+90=91\\nn=22: f(22)=3 f(11)=93\\nn=23: f(23)=1+3 f(11)=1+93=94\\nn=24: f(24)=3 f(12)=108\\nn=25: f(25)=1+3 f(12)=1+108=109\\nn=26: f(26)=3 f(13)=111\\nn=27: f(27)=1+3 f(13)=1+111=112\\nn=28: f(28)=3 f(14)=117\\nn=29: f(29)=1+3 f(14)=1+117=118\\nn=30: f(30)=3 f(15)=120\\nn=31: f(31)=1+3 f(15)=1+120=121\\nn=32: f(32)=3 f(16)=3·81=243\\nn=33: f(33)=1+3 f(16)=1+243=244\\nAlready f(33)>293, but we only need to consider up to where f(n)≤292. In fact f(32)=243, f(33)≥244.\\nContinue a bit more because some values near 292 appear later.\\n\\nn=34: f(34)=3 f(17)=3·82=246\\nn=35: f(35)=1+3 f(17)=1+246=247\\nn=36: f(36)=3 f(18)=3·84=252\\nn=37: f(37)=1+3 f(18)=1+252=253\\nn=38: f(38)=3 f(19)=3·85=255\\nn=39: f(39)=1+3 f(19)=1+255=256\\nn=40: f(40)=3 f(20)=3·90=270\\nn=41: f(41)=1+3 f(20)=1+270=271\\nn=42: f(42)=3 f(21)=3·91=273\\nn=43: f(43)=1+3 f(21)=1+273=274\\nn=44: f(44)=3 f(22)=3·93=279\\nn=45: f(45)=1+3 f(22)=1+279=280\\nn=46: f(46)=3 f(23)=3·94=282\\nn=47: f(47)=1+3 f(23)=1+282=283\\nn=48: f(48)=3 f(24)=3·108=324>293.\\nFrom this point f(n)≥324>293, so no further values matter.\\nTherefore f(n)≤292 happens for n≤47, and the largest such value we see is f(47)=283 < 293. But we also know for n>=48, f(n) ≥ 324, so overall the maximum value of f below 293 is 283.\\n\\nStep 5: Find all pairs f(k)+f(l)=293.\\nWe list f(n) for 1≤n≤47 clearly:\\n1:1\\n2:3\\n3:4\\n4:9\\n5:10\\n6:12\\n7:13\\n8:27\\n9:28\\n10:30\\n11:31\\n12:36\\n13:37\\n14:39\\n15:40\\n16:81\\n17:82\\n18:84\\n19:85\\n20:90\\n21:91\\n22:93\\n23:94\\n24:108\\n25:109\\n26:111\\n27:112\\n28:117\\n29:118\\n30:120\\n31:121\\n32:243\\n33:244\\n34:246\\n35:247\\n36:252\\n37:253\\n38:255\\n39:256\\n40:270\\n41:271\\n42:273\\n43:274\\n44:279\\n45:280\\n46:282\\n47:283\\n\\nWe need f(k)+f(l)=293, with k<l.\\nSince f is strictly increasing, f(k) < f(l). So f(k)≤146 (since if f(k)>146, then both >146 and sum>292). Look for pairs (v,293−v) within the value set.\\nNow 293−1=292 (not present).\\n293−3=290 (not present).\\n293−4=289 (not present).\\n293−9=284 (not present).\\n293−10=283; 283 is present as f(47). So f(5)=10 and f(47)=283 give a pair; corresponding indices (5,47).\\n293−12=281 (not present).\\n293−13=280; 280 is present (f(45)). That gives k corresponding to 13 (n=13) and l=45.\\n293−27=266 (not present).\\n293−28=265 (not present).\\n293−30=263 (not present).\\n293−31=262 (not present).\\n293−36=257 (not present).\\n293−37=256; 256 is present (f(39)). So n=13? Wait check: f(13)=37; we already used 37; sorry here we are scanning values; f(13)=37; 293−37=256 which is f(39). So pair (13,39).\\n293−39=254 (not present).\\n293−40=253; 253 is f(37). So pair where smaller value 40 is f(15), larger 253 is f(37) ⇒ (15,37).\\n293−81=212 (not present).\\n293−82=211 (not present).\\n293−84=209 (not present).\\n293−85=208 (not present).\\n293−90=203 (not present).\\n293−91=202 (not present).\\n293−93=200 (not present).\\n293−94=199 (not present).\\n293−108=185 (not present).\\n293−109=184 (not present).\\n293−111=182 (not present).\\n293−112=181 (not present).\\n293−117=176 (not present).\\n293−118=175 (not present).\\n293−120=173 (not present).\\n293−121=172 (not present).\\nValue 146 isn't in the list so we are done.\\nThus the value pairs (f(k),f(l)) are (10,283), (37,256), (40,253), and accordingly indices (5,47), (13,39), (15,37). We also noted pair (13,45) when checking 13 and 280? Let's verify carefully.\\nValues:\\n13: f(7)\\n37: f(13)\\n40: f(15)\\n280: f(45)\\nWe computed earlier 293−13=280 and 280 is present at n=45, giving pair (7,45)? But k<l refers to indices; re-evaluate:\\nWe systematically used values below 146. For each such value v=f(n), we looked at 293−v.\\nWe must ensure we start from all n up to where f(n)≤146.\\nFind cutoff index where f(n) just exceeds 146: f(28)=117, f(29)=118, f(30)=120, f(31)=121, f(32)=243>146. So we need n=1..31.\\nNow check n=1..31 again:\\n1:1 → 292 no.\\n2:3 → 290 no.\\n3:4 → 289 no.\\n4:9 → 284 no.\\n5:10 → 283 yes (n=47).\\n6:12 →281 no.\\n7:13 → 280 yes (n=45).\\n8:27 → 266 no.\\n9:28 → 265 no.\\n10:30→263 no.\\n11:31→262 no.\\n12:36→257 no.\\n13:37→256 yes (n=39).\\n14:39→254 no.\\n15:40→253 yes (n=37).\\n16:81→212 no.\\n17:82→211 no.\\n18:84→209 no.\\n19:85→208 no.\\n20:90→203 no.\\n21:91→202 no.\\n22:93→200 no.\\n23:94→199 no.\\n24:108→185 no.\\n25:109→184 no.\\n26:111→182 no.\\n27:112→181 no.\\n28:117→176 no.\\n29:118→175 no.\\n30:120→173 no.\\n31:121→172 no.\\nSo the valid pairs in terms of (n_small, n_large) are:\\n(5,47) since f(5)=10, f(47)=283.\\n(7,45) since f(7)=13, f(45)=280.\\n(13,39) since f(13)=37, f(39)=256.\\n(15,37) since f(15)=40, f(37)=253.\\nThese are distinct and satisfy k<l.\\nSo the solutions are (k,l) ∈ {(5,47),(7,45),(13,39),(15,37)}.\\n\\nProblem 2\\nGiven a,b,c,d,e ≥ −1, with a+b+c+d+e=5, we want the maximum and minimum of S=(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+e)(e+a).\\n\\nStep 1: Look for symmetry and substitution.\\nThe expression S is cyclic, symmetric under rotation of indices, and the constraints are symmetric in all variables. This suggests extremes occur at symmetric points or at boundary points with some variables at the constraint −1.\\nLet us consider substitution x1=a+b, x2=b+c, x3=c+d, x4=d+e, x5=e+a. These are the factors; we want to maximize product of x_i subject to constraints implied by a..e.\\nAlso, note that a+b+ c + d + e=5.\\nWe have linear relations between x_i and a..e. For instance, adding all x_i:\\n(a+b)+(b+c)+(c+d)+(d+e)+(e+a) = 2(a+b+c+d+e) = 2·5=10.\\nTherefore x1+...+x5=10.\\nWe also have each x_i is a sum of two variables each ≥−1, so x_i ≥ −2. But we might need more precise feasibility, yet for extremes probably constraints on xi≥−2 suffice.\\nThe mapping (a..e)→(x1..x5) mirrors a circulant linear system:\\nx1=a+b\\nx2=b+c\\nx3=c+d\\nx4=d+e\\nx5=e+a.\\nSolve in terms of xi to characterize feasible region.\\nAdd x1+x3+x5: (a+b)+(c+d)+(e+a)=2a+b+c+d+e.\\nUsing total T=a+b+...+e=5, we get 2a+ (T−a)=a+T ⇒ x1+x3+x5=a+5 ⇒ a=x1+x3+x5−5.\\nSimilarly, cyclically:\\nb=x2+x4+x1−5\\nc=x3+x5+x2−5\\nd=x4+x1+x3−5\\ne=x5+x2+x4−5.\\nConstraint a≥−1 ⇒ x1+x3+x5−5 ≥ −1 ⇒ x1+x3+x5 ≥4.\\nSimilarly for b,c,d,e:\\nFor each i, sum of three alternating xi ≥4.\\nExplicitly:\\n(i) x1+x3+x5 ≥4\\n(ii) x2+x4+x1 ≥4\\n(iii) x3+x5+x2 ≥4\\n(iv) x4+x1+x3 ≥4\\n(v) x5+x2+x4 ≥4.\\nAnd x1+...+x5=10.\\nWe want extrema of P=x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 under those linear constraints.\\nNote also: since the constraint set is convex and P is symmetric, maximum may occur at all xi equal, minimum at boundary.\\n\\nStep 2: Interior symmetric point.\\nIf a=b=c=d=e, then each equals 1 (since sum 5). This satisfies a≥−1. Then each factor (a+b)=2, so S=2^5=32.\\nThis corresponds to xi all equal: x1=...=x5=2, sum 10. Check constraints: any triple sum e.g. x1+x3+x5=2+2+2=6≥4, etc. So (2,2,2,2,2) is feasible. By AM-GM, for unconstrained positive xi with fixed sum 10, product is maximized when all equal, giving product 32. Constraints only reduce feasible set, not expand, so the unique global maximum still occurs at xi=2, provided that remains feasible; it is feasible as shown. Hence maximum S=32.\\n\\nStep 3: Minimum analysis.\\nBecause xi can be negative (if some variables near −1), the product can be negative or positive. We need global minimum subject to constraints. Investigate boundary where some a..e are −1.\\nSimplify by exploring symmetric cases in a,b,c,d,e that still meet sum 5.\\n\\nCase A: One variable −1.\\nSay e=−1. Then a+b+c+d=6. Consider symmetric in a,b,c,d; a=b=c=d=1.5 gives a+b+c+d=6 and all ≥−1. Then\\n(a+b) = 3,\\n(b+c) = 3,\\n(c+d) = 3,\\n(d+e) = d+e = 1.5−1=0.5,\\n(e+a) = −1+1.5=0.5.\\nSo S=3·3·3·0.5·0.5=27·0.25=6.75.\\nNot small.\\nTry more extreme: push one variable big, others near −1.\\nBut sum of a..d is fixed 6; e is fixed −1. Minimizing S requires making some factors zero or negative.\\nZero is possible if one factor is 0, e.g. a=−b. Check feasibility.\\n\\nObserve easier via xi system: we want minimal product with xi sum 10 and triple-sum constraints ≥4. xi can be as low as −2 but constrained. Likely minimum occurs when some triple constraints tight and some xi at bounds.\\nConsider trying to make one xi large and others small negative to make product very negative. But triple constraints might forbid too many negative values.\\nEmpirically, try patterns in original variables.\\n\\nTry putting two variables at −1.\\nLet a=b=−1, others adjust: c+d+e=7. Then terms:\\n(a+b) = −2,\\n(b+c) = −1+c,\\n(c+d) = c+d,\\n(d+e) = d+e,\\n(e+a) = e−1.\\nWe want product with factor −2; others may be positive.\\nTry symmetrical c=d=e=7/3≈2.333.\\nThen b+c = −1+7/3=4/3,\\n(c+d)=14/3,\\n(d+e)=14/3,\\n(e+a)=7/3−1=4/3.\\nProduct S=−2*(4/3)*(14/3)*(14/3)*(4/3)=−2*(16/9)*(196/9)=−2*(3136/81)=−6272/81≈−77.4.\\nThis is less than 32; is it minimal? Maybe more negative is possible.\\nTry three variables at −1.\\nLet a=b=c=−1, then d+e=8.\\nThen\\n(a+b)=−2,\\n(b+c)=−2,\\n(c+d)=−1+d,\\n(d+e),\\n(e+a)=e−1.\\nLet d=e=4. Then\\n(c+d)=3,\\n(d+e)=8,\\n(e+a)=3.\\nProduct S= (−2)*(−2)*3*8*3=4*72=288 positive.\\nSo sign depends.\\n\\nTry four variables at −1.\\nLet a=b=c=d=−1, then e=9.\\nTerms:\\n(a+b)=−2,\\n(b+c)=−2,\\n(c+d)=−2,\\n(d+e)=−1+9=8,\\n(e+a)=9−1=8.\\nThen S=(−2)^3*8*8=−8*64=−512.\\nConstraints: all variables are ≥−1 and sum=−1−1−1−1+9=5. So this is feasible.\\nThus S can reach −512, which is much lower than previous negative value. This is a strong candidate for minimum.\\n\\nTry five variables at boundary? Not possible because sum must be 5 and min sum if all −1 is −5; contradiction.\\nSo -512 seems a candidate minimum.\\nWe should check if we can get less than −512.\\nGiven each variable ≥−1 and sum fixed, the more extreme distribution is with as many variables at −1 as possible and the last variable taking the remaining mass. Four at −1 and one big is the extremal pattern; making three at −1 moves some mass from the fourth from −1 to some positive; that tends to shrink magnitude of extreme pair sums like (e+a) and also reduce magnitude of negative factors count.\\nWe can quickly reason: With domain a_i≥−1 and sum fixed, to minimize the product of sums of adjacent pairs, we push as many as possible to −1. We already achieved configuration with four at −1 and one at 9. Could we get more negative by permuting which one is 9? No, cyclic symmetry means all such permutations have same S.\\nCould there be different combination with some variables not exactly −1 but leading to even more negative S? If we perturb small variables from −1 upwards, some of the (a+b) sums become less negative or change sign, generally reducing the magnitude of negative product or flipping sign. Since the extreme we found has exactly three negative factors (−2 each) and two positive factors (8 each). To get a more negative product, we might try to increase magnitudes of negative factors while keeping positive ones large; but negative factors cannot be less than −2 because a,b≥−1. They already are at minimum −2. Positive factors (like d+e, e+a) are at 8 (since 9−1). If we change distribution while keeping four variables low, we might keep one pair sum >8? But the largest possible pair sum occurs with one variable very large and neighbor just below 9; but sum constraints limit that: if we try to increase one of 8’s, we need to make some other variable below −1 or reduce another positive pair sum, which is not allowed. More formally, with four at −1, the max of last variable is 9 and that’s what we used, so the 8’s are maximal neighbor sums.\\nThus the configuration a=b=c=d=−1, e=9 gives three smallest possible (most negative) pair sums and two largest positive pair sums; this should minimize S. Due to convexity on edges, the minimum over this compact polytope occurs at a vertex (all coordinates at bounds except as needed for the sum), so this is indeed global minimum.\\nTherefore minimum S_min = −512.\\n\\nWe have already found maximum S_max=32 at a=b=c=d=e=1.\\n\\nThus solutions:\\nProblem 1: (k,l) are (5,47), (7,45), (13,39), (15,37).\\nProblem 2: maximum 32, minimum −512.\\n\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"(5,47),(7,45),(13,39),(15,37)\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"maximum 32, minimum -512\"\n}",
