      "A401": "Trevor and Edward play a game in which they take turns adding or removing beans from a pile. On each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. The player who empties the pile wins. For example, if Trevor goes first with a pile of 5 beans, he can either add 4 to make the total 9, or remove 4 to make the total 1, and either way Edward wins by removing all the beans. There is no limit to how large the pile can grow; it just starts with some finite number of beans in it, say fewer than 1000. Before the game begins, Edward dispatches a spy to find out how many beans will be in the opening pile, call this $n$, then \"graciously\" offers to let Trevor go first. Knowing that the first player is more likely to win, but not knowing $n$, Trevor logically but unwisely accepts, and Edward goes on to win the game. Find a number $n$ less than 1000 that would prompt this scenario, assuming both players are perfect logicians. A correct answer is worth the nearest integer to $\\log _{2}(n-4)$ points. Instead of finding an initial pile size $n$ less than 1000 that is a losing position for the first player under perfect play, simply find $k = s(p) - 6$, where $p$ is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example, and $s(p)$ is the largest perfect square at most $p$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe are told: “Instead of finding an initial pile size n less than 1000 that is a losing position for the first player under perfect play, simply find k = s(p) - 6, where p is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example, and s(p) is the largest perfect square at most p.”\\n\\nThe example: initial pile is 5 beans. The largest perfect square ≤ 5 is 4. “Adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile” means we add 4 to 5, so\\np = 5 + 4 = 9.\\nNow s(p) is the largest perfect square ≤ p. For p = 9, the largest perfect square ≤ 9 is clearly 9, so s(p) = 9.\\nThus k = s(p) − 6 = 9 − 6 = 3.\\nSo the required value for Problem 1 is 3.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe want the number of distinct colorings of the vertices of a tetrahedron using colors {red, blue, green} such that no face has all three vertices the same color. The wording is slightly tricky: “such that no face has all three vertices the same color.” The natural, standard interpretation in vertex coloring problems is that each face (a triangle) is forbidden to have all three of its vertices the same color (i.e., we cannot have a monochromatic face). If the intent were “no face has all three vertices different colors”, it would be phrased that way; here, the phrase “the same color” grammatically attaches to “all three vertices”, so the forbidden configuration is a face whose three vertices all share the same color.\\n\\nWe must also account for rotational symmetry: two colorings are considered the same if a rotation of the tetrahedron maps one coloring onto the other. The symmetry group of the tetrahedron (rotational) is isomorphic to A4 and has 12 elements.\\n\\nWe solve using Burnside’s Lemma. First classify the rotational symmetries of a regular tetrahedron:\\n- Identity rotation: 1 element.\\n- Rotations about an axis through a vertex and the center of the opposite face (3-fold rotations): each such axis has a 120° and 240° rotation, giving 8 elements total (4 axes × 2 nontrivial rotations each).\\n- Rotations that are 180° about an axis through the midpoints of a pair of opposite edges: 3 such axes, hence 3 elements.\\nTotal: 1 + 8 + 3 = 12.\\n\\nWe consider colorings of the 4 vertices with 3 colors, under the constraint that no face is monochromatic. Denote the vertices by A, B, C, D, with faces ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.\\n\\n1) Identity element:\\nUnder the identity, every coloring is fixed. We must count valid colorings (no monochromatic face) of 4 labeled vertices with 3 colors.\\nTotal colorings without restriction: 3^4 = 81.\\nSubtract those having at least one monochromatic face. Use inclusion–exclusion.\\nDefine Fi = event that face i is monochromatic (all 3 of its vertices the same color). There are 4 faces. For a given face, to be monochromatic we choose a color (3 ways) for its 3 vertices; the remaining vertex (the fourth vertex) can be any of 3 colors. So each Fi has 3 × 3 = 9 colorings.\\nCompute intersections: two distinct faces that share an edge involve all 4 vertices. If faces F1 and F2 are both monochromatic, with the shared edge vertex colors forcing consistency, each face must be monochromatic in the same color. So for any pair of faces, there are 3 colorings (choose the common color, everything is that color). Thus |Fi ∩ Fj| = 3 for any pair.\\nTriple intersections: taking three faces in a tetrahedron, they always involve all four vertices with overlaps; again, the only possibility is that all four vertices share the same color, so 3 colorings. Similarly, intersection of all 4 faces is the same: all vertices the same color, 3 colorings.\\nCompute:\\nΣ|Fi| = 4 × 9 = 36.\\nΣ|Fi ∩ Fj| over {4 choose 2} = 6 pairs, each of size 3, so 6 × 3 = 18.\\nΣ triple intersections over {4 choose 3} = 4 triples, each 3, so 4 × 3 = 12.\\n|F1 ∩ F2 ∩ F3 ∩ F4| = 3.\\nBy inclusion–exclusion, #colorings with ≥1 monochromatic face = 36 − 18 + 12 − 3 = 27.\\nTherefore valid colorings = 81 − 27 = 54.\\nSo the identity fixes 54 valid colorings.\\n\\n2) 3-fold rotations (120° and 240° around vertex–face axes): 8 elements.\\nConsider an axis through vertex A and face BCD. The rotation permutes B, C, D cyclically, while A is fixed.\\nTo be fixed by such a rotation, the colors on the 3-cycle B, C, D must all be equal. Let the color of B, C, D be x, and color of A be y, where x, y ∈ {R, G, B}. So there are 3 choices for x and 3 for y, total 9 colorings fixed by a 3-fold rotation (ignoring constraints). Now we apply the no-monochromatic-face constraint.\\nFaces:\\n- BCD has all three vertices equal (x,x,x). This is monochromatic and thus forbidden regardless of x.\\nTherefore every coloring fixed by this rotation has at least one monochromatic face (BCD), so none of them are valid.\\nHence each 3-fold rotation fixes 0 valid colorings.\\nSince all 3-fold rotations are conjugate, the same reasoning applies to all 8 elements. So total fixed count from this class: 8 × 0 = 0.\\n\\n3) 180° edge-midpoint rotations: 3 elements.\\nConsider one such rotation that swaps vertices A ↔ B and C ↔ D. Under this rotation, a coloring is fixed only if A and B share the same color and C and D share the same color.\\nSo, choose color for A and B jointly: 3 choices. Choose color for C and D jointly: 3 choices. Total 3 × 3 = 9 fixed colorings (before constraints).\\nNow enforce “no monochromatic face”. Faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.\\nUnder the restrictions: A = B = x, C = D = y.\\nCompute face colors:\\n- ABC: (x, x, y). Monochromatic only if x = y.\\n- ABD: (x, x, y). Same condition.\\n- ACD: (x, y, y).\\n- BCD: (x, y, y).\\nIf x = y (all four vertices same color), all faces are monochromatic and hence invalid. There are 3 such colorings (x = y = each color).\\nIf x ≠ y, then each face has two vertices of one color and one of the other, hence no face is monochromatic. That is valid.\\nNumber of ordered pairs (x, y) with x, y in {3 colors} and x ≠ y is 3 × 2 = 6.\\nTherefore, among the 9 fixed colorings, 6 satisfy the constraint.\\nSo each 180° rotation fixes 6 valid colorings. With 3 such rotations, total fixed colorings from this class: 3 × 6 = 18.\\n\\nUsing Burnside’s Lemma:\\nNumber of distinct colorings under rotations = (1/12) × (sum over group elements of #fixed valid colorings).\\nWe have:\\n- Identity: 54.\\n- 8 threefold rotations: 0.\\n- 3 half-turns: 6 each, total 18.\\nThus total fixed = 54 + 0 + 18 = 72.\\nThen the number of distinct colorings is 72 / 12 = 6.\\n\\nTherefore, Problem 1 answer is 3 and Problem 2 answer is 6.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
