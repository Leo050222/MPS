      "A1054": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $e = N - 86$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nThere are 8 antigens; each student’s blood type is a distinct subset of these, so there are 2^8 = 256 distinct subsets and all appear exactly once.\\nFor any fixed antigen A, among all 256 subsets, exactly half contain A and half do not (each antigen is present in a subset with probability 1/2, independently across the 8 antigens). Thus the number N of students whose blood type includes antigen A is N = 256 * (1/2) = 128.\\nWe are asked to compute e = N - 86, so e = 128 - 86 = 42.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nLet the three integers be a, b, c.\\nAlex’s operation: pick two numbers, average them, then add the result to the third.\\nSo the three possible results are:\\nR1 = (b + c)/2 + a\\nR2 = (a + c)/2 + b\\nR3 = (a + b)/2 + c\\nWe’re told the possible final results (in some order) are 42, 13, 37.\\nAssume correspondences:\\n(1) a + (b + c)/2 = 42\\n(2) b + (a + c)/2 = 13\\n(3) c + (a + b)/2 = 37\\nRewrite them:\\n(1) 2a + b + c = 84\\n(2) a + 2b + c = 26\\n(3) a + b + 2c = 74\\nSubtract (2) from (1): (2a + b + c) - (a + 2b + c) = 84 - 26 => a - b = 58 => a = b + 58.\\nSubtract (3) from (2): (a + 2b + c) - (a + b + 2c) = 26 - 74 => b - c = -48 => b = c - 48.\\nThen a = (c - 48) + 58 = c + 10.\\nPlug into (3):\\n(a + b + 2c) = 74 => (c + 10) + (c - 48) + 2c = 74\\n=> 4c - 38 = 74\\n=> 4c = 112\\n=> c = 28.\\nThen b = c - 48 = 28 - 48 = -20.\\nThen a = c + 10 = 28 + 10 = 38.\\nCheck the three results:\\n(b + c)/2 + a = ( -20 + 28 )/2 + 38 = 8/2 + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42.\\n(a + c)/2 + b = (38 + 28)/2 - 20 = 66/2 - 20 = 33 - 20 = 13.\\n(a + b)/2 + c = (38 - 20)/2 + 28 = 18/2 + 28 = 9 + 28 = 37.\\nAll match, so the original integers are 38, -20, 28 (in any order).\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"42\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"38,-20,28\"\n}",
