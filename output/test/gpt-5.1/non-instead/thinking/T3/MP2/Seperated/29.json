  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe start from the given equation:\\n  p/q - 4/(r+1) = 1\\nwith p, q, r primes. Rewrite:\\n  p/q = 1 + 4/(r+1) = (r+1 + 4)/(r+1) = (r+5)/(r+1)\\nSo p/q = (r+5)/(r+1). Since p and q are primes, (r+5) and (r+1) must be (up to a common factor) prime. Compute gcd(r+5, r+1) = gcd(r+1, 4), so the possible common divisor is 1, 2, or 4.\\nWe need p, q primes, so (r+5)/(r+1) in lowest terms must have prime numerator and prime denominator.\\nCase gcd = 1: then r+5 = p, r+1 = q, with p and q primes. That imposes no obvious contradiction, but now look at the instruction in the problem statement: “simply find n = r + 2009, where r is the prime number such that r + 1 equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term.” The subtracted fractional term is 4/(r+1); its numerator is 4. They’re telling us to take r+1 equal to that numerator. So we require:\\n  r + 1 = 4\\nThus r = 3. This r is prime and satisfies the stated condition.\\nThen\\n  n = r + 2009 = 3 + 2009 = 2012.\\nSo for Problem 1, n = 2012.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have an 8x8 toroidal chessboard. Each step, the walker moves one of the four diagonal directions with equal probability 1/4. Diagonal moves change coordinates by (±1, ±1) modulo 8. Let the position be (x, y) in Z_8 × Z_8. Moves are:\\n  (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1) mod 8.\\nWe want the probability that after 2012 steps, the position returns to the origin (0,0), starting from (0,0).\\nThis is a finite abelian group random walk; the transition is symmetric. The standard method uses discrete Fourier transform on Z_8 × Z_8. The characters are χ_{a,b}(x,y) = exp(2πi(ax + by)/8). The one-step transition operator T has eigenvalues:\\n  λ(a,b) = E[χ_{a,b}(Δx, Δy)]\\nwhere (Δx, Δy) is one step.\\nSince each move is equally likely among the four diagonals:\\n  λ(a,b) = 1/4 * [ e^{2πi(a+b)/8} + e^{2πi(a-b)/8} + e^{2πi(-a+b)/8} + e^{2πi(-a-b)/8} ].\\nGroup terms: this becomes:\\n  λ(a,b) = (1/2) [ cos(2π(a+b)/8) + cos(2π(a-b)/8) ].\\nUsing trig identities, cos(α+β)+cos(α-β)=2cosα cosβ, we get:\\n  λ(a,b) = cos(2πa/8) * cos(2πb/8).\\nSo the eigenvalues are λ(a,b) = cos(πa/4) cos(πb/4) for a,b∈{0,…,7}.\\nOn a finite abelian group, the return probability after t steps is the average of λ(a,b)^t over all characters:\\n  P_t(0→0) = (1/64) * Σ_{a=0}^7 Σ_{b=0}^7 [λ(a,b)]^t.\\nThus\\n  P_t = (1/64) Σ_{a,b} [cos(πa/4) cos(πb/4)]^t.\\nThis factorizes:\\n  P_t = (1/64) [ Σ_{a=0}^7 cos^t(πa/4) ]^2,\\nbecause the double sum over a,b is the square of a single sum.\\nDefine:\\n  S(t) = Σ_{a=0}^7 cos^t(πa/4).\\nThen P_t = (1/64)[S(t)]^2.\\nWe need t = 2012, which is even. Let t = 2k with k = 1006.\\nWe need to evaluate cos^{2k} at special angles in {0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π, 5π/4, 3π/2, 7π/4}.\\nValues:\\n  a=0: cos(0) = 1.\\n  a=1: cos(π/4) = √2/2.\\n  a=2: cos(π/2) = 0.\\n  a=3: cos(3π/4) = -√2/2.\\n  a=4: cos(π) = -1.\\n  a=5: cos(5π/4) = -√2/2.\\n  a=6: cos(3π/2) = 0.\\n  a=7: cos(7π/4) = √2/2.\\nFor even power 2k, sign disappears: cos^{2k}(θ) = (|cos θ|)^{2k}.\\nThus the distinct magnitudes are:\\n  |cos 0| = 1.\\n  |cos π/4| = √2/2.\\n  |cos π/2| = 0.\\n  |cos π| = 1.\\nThe multiplicities among a=0…7:\\n  cos(0) and cos(π) have |cos| = 1; that’s a=0,4 → 2 terms.\\n  cos(±π/4), cos(±3π/4) = ±√2/2; that’s a=1,3,5,7 → 4 terms.\\n  cos(π/2), cos(3π/2) = 0; that’s a=2,6 → 2 terms.\\nSo:\\n  S(2k) = 2*1^{2k} + 4*( (√2/2)^{2k} ) + 2*0^{2k}.\\nFor k>0, 0^{2k}=0.\\nAlso (√2/2)^{2k} = (1/2)^k.\\nThus\\n  S(2k) = 2 + 4*(1/2)^k = 2 + 4/2^k.\\nFor t=2012, k=1006, so\\n  S(2012) = 2 + 4/2^{1006}.\\nThen\\n  P_{2012} = (1/64) [2 + 4/2^{1006}]^2.\\nFactor out 2:\\n  2 + 4/2^{1006} = 2 * [1 + (4/2^{1006})/2] = 2 * [1 + 2/2^{1006}] = 2 * [1 + 2^{1-1006}] = 2 * [1 + 2^{-1005}].\\nSo\\n  P_{2012} = (1/64) * 4 * [1 + 2^{-1005}]^2 = (4/64)[1 + 2^{-1005}]^2 = (1/16)[1 + 2^{-1005}]^2.\\nExpand if desired:\\n  (1 + 2^{-1005})^2 = 1 + 2*2^{-1005} + 2^{-2010} = 1 + 2^{-1004} + 2^{-2010}.\\nThus\\n  P_{2012} = (1/16)(1 + 2^{-1004} + 2^{-2010}).\\nAs a single fraction with denominator 2^{2014}:\\n  1/16 = 2^{-4}, so multiply numerator and denominator to get a common denominator 2^{2014}:\\n  (1/16)*(1 + 2^{-1004} + 2^{-2010})\\n  = [2^{2010} + 2^{1006} + 1]/2^{2014}.\\nChecking: factor 1/16 = 1/2^4 into each term: 1/16 gives 2^{2010}/2^{2014}, 1/(16*2^{1004}) gives 2^{1006}/2^{2014}, and 1/(16*2^{2010}) gives 1/2^{2014}. So the exact probability is:\\n  P = (2^{2010} + 2^{1006} + 1) / 2^{2014}.\\nThis is an exact rational in simplest form since numerator is odd.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: n = 2012.\\nProblem 2: probability = (2^{2010} + 2^{1006} + 1)/2^{2014}.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2012\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"(2^{2010} + 2^{1006} + 1)/2^{2014}\"\n}",
