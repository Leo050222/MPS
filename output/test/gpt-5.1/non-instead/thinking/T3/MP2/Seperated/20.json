Check trivial case m = n:\\nThen m^5 - m^5 = 0, so 0 = 16m^2 ⇒ m = 0. Thus (m,n) = (0,0) is a solution.\\n\\nAssume now (m,n) ≠ (0,0).\\n\\n2) Factorization and divisibility:\\nWrite m^5 - n^5 = (m-n)(m^4 + m^3 n + m^2 n^2 + m n^3 + n^4).\\nThen\\n(m-n)(m^4 + m^3 n + m^2 n^2 + m n^3 + n^4) = 16mn.\\nIf mn = 0, from the original equation we get m^5 - n^5 = 0, so m = ±n. But if one is 0, say n=0, then m^5 = 0 ⇒ m=0. Similarly for m=0. So the only solution with mn=0 is (0,0).\\nHence for nontrivial solutions we have m ≠ 0, n ≠ 0.\\n\\n3) Use symmetry via scaling / gcd:\\nLet d = gcd(m,n), m = d x, n = d y, gcd(x,y)=1.\\nPlug into equation:\\n(d x)^5 - (d y)^5 = 16 (d x)(d y)\\n⇒ d^5(x^5 - y^5) = 16 d^2 x y\\n⇒ d^3(x^5 - y^5) = 16 x y.\\nSince gcd(x,y)=1, gcd(x^5 - y^5, x y) = 1 (any common divisor would divide y^5 and xy, hence y, and then x, contradicting gcd=1). Thus gcd(x^5 - y^5, x y)=1.\\nSo from d^3(x^5 - y^5) = 16 x y, and the gcd being 1, we must have x^5 - y^5 | 16 and x y | d^3. In particular, x^5 - y^5 is an integer divisor of 16.\\n\\nSo x^5 - y^5 ∈ {±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±16}.\\n\\n4) Bounding possibilities for x and y:\\nSince gcd(x,y)=1 and both can be negative, we check small possibilities. But note that if |x| ≥ 2 and |y| ≥ 2, then |x^5| and |y^5| are at least 32, so |x^5 - y^5| is 0 or ≥1, but to be small (≤16 in magnitude) they must be very close; an exhaustive small check is simpler.\\n\\nBecause x^5 grows quickly, any solution with |x| ≥ 3 or |y| ≥ 3 makes |x^5 - y^5| ≥ 243 - 32 = 211 or so (depending on the combination), which is too large. So |x|,|y| ≤ 2.\\nNow list co-prime integer pairs (x,y) with |x|,|y| ≤ 2:\\n(0, ±1), (±1, 0), (±1, ±1), (±1, ±2), (±2, ±1).\\nWe exclude (0,0) because gcd must be 1 and we want both nonzero later, but still we can check all pairs.\\nCompute x^5 - y^5:\\n- (x,y)=(1,0): 1 - 0 = 1.\\n- (x,y)=(0,1): 0 - 1 = -1.\\n- (x,y)=(-1,0): -1 - 0 = -1.\\n- (x,y)=(0,-1): 0 - (-1) = 1.\\n- (1,1): 1 - 1 = 0 (not allowed, divisor must divide 16 but then x^5 - y^5 = 0 would make LHS zero ⇒ RHS 16xy=0 ⇒ xy=0, contradiction since here xy=1).\\n- (1,-1): 1 - (-1) = 2.\\n- (-1,1): -1 - 1 = -2.\\n- (-1,-1): -1 - (-1) = 0 (same issue).\\n- (1,2): 1 - 32 = -31 (too large in magnitude).\\n- (2,1): 32 - 1 = 31.\\n- (1,-2): 1 - (-32) = 33.\\n- (-2,1): -32 - 1 = -33.\\n- (-1,2): -1 - 32 = -33.\\n- (2,-1): 32 - (-1) = 33.\\n- (-1,-2): -1 - (-32) = 31.\\n- (-2,-1): -32 - (-1) = -31.\\nSo the only pairs with |x^5 - y^5| dividing 16 are those where x and/or y are 0 or ±1, and with x^5 - y^5 ∈ {±1, ±2}. The values ±4, ±8, ±16 don't arise from such small coprime pairs.\\n\\nNow we must also satisfy the equation d^3(x^5 - y^5) = 16 x y.\\nWe now test all these candidate (x,y) and solve for integer d.\\n\\nCase A: (x,y) = (1,0) or (0,1) or (-1,0) or (0,-1).\\nBut here y=0 or x=0, which would make one of m or n zero (since m=d x, n=d y). We already know any solution with a zero is only (0,0). In all these cases xy=0, so RHS 16xy=0, while x^5 - y^5 is ±1; then d^3(x^5 - y^5)=0 ⇒ d=0, giving m=n=0. So these don't give new nontrivial solutions.\\n\\nCase B: (x,y)=(1,-1): x^5 - y^5 = 2, xy = -1.\\nEquation: d^3 * 2 = 16 * (-1) ⇒ 2 d^3 = -16 ⇒ d^3 = -8 ⇒ d = -2.\\nThus m = d x = -2 * 1 = -2, n = d y = -2 * (-1) = 2.\\nSo (m,n)=(-2,2).\\nCheck: (-2)^5 - 2^5 = -32 - 32 = -64; 16mn=16*(-2*2) = -64. Works.\\n\\nCase C: (x,y)=(-1,1): x^5 - y^5 = -2, xy = -1.\\nEquation: d^3 * (-2) = 16 * (-1) ⇒ -2 d^3 = -16 ⇒ d^3 = 8 ⇒ d = 2.\\nThen m = d x = 2 * (-1) = -2, n = d y = 2 * 1 = 2.\\nThis yields the same pair (-2,2) again.\\n\\nCase D: (x,y)=(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1) gave only (0,0).\\n\\nCase E: (x,y)=(1,1) or (-1,-1) impossible because x^5 - y^5=0 gives 16xy=0 ⇒ xy=0, contradiction.\\n\\nTherefore the only integer solutions are (m,n)=(0,0) and (m,n)=(-2,2).\\n(Notice that (2,-2) does not solve the original equation: 32 - (-32)=64 ≠ 16*(2 * -2)=-64.)\\nSo Problem 1 answer: (m,n)=(0,0) and (m,n)=(-2,2).\\n\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nPolynomial: x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48 with positive roots p<q<r.\\nWe want the minimum of S = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r.\\n\\n1) Use Vieta:\\nFor polynomial x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48 with roots p,q,r:\\nSum: p + q + r = a.\\nPairwise sum: pq + pr + qr = b.\\nProduct: pqr = 48.\\nWe need to minimize S = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r under constraints p<q<r, p,q,r>0, pqr=48.\\n\\n2) Consider continuous optimization with constraint pqr=48 and positivity; we expect the minimum occurs at some critical interior point; then later ensure distinctness p<q<r can be achieved arbitrarily close, making the same infimum.\\nUse Lagrange multipliers for f(p,q,r)=1/p+2/q+3/r with g(p,q,r)=pqr-48=0.\\n\\n3) Lagrange equations:\\n∂f/∂p = -1/p^2, ∂f/∂q = -2/q^2, ∂f/∂r = -3/r^2.\\nConstraint: pqr=48.\\nSet ∇f = λ ∇g, where ∇g=(qr,pr,pq).\\nThus:\\n-1/p^2 = λ qr  ...(1)\\n-2/q^2 = λ pr  ...(2)\\n-3/r^2 = λ pq  ...(3)\\n\\n4) Eliminate λ by taking ratios:\\nFrom (1)/(2):\\n(-1/p^2)/(-2/q^2) = (λqr)/(λpr) ⇒ (1/p^2)/(2/q^2) = q/p.\\nCompute LHS: (1/p^2)/(2/q^2) = (1/p^2)*(q^2/2) = q^2/(2 p^2).\\nSo q^2/(2 p^2) = q/p.\\nAssuming q,p>0, multiply both sides by 2 p^2:\\nq^2 = 2 p q.\\nIf q≠0, divide by q: q = 2p.\\nThus q = 2p.\\n\\nFrom (2)/(3):\\n(-2/q^2)/(-3/r^2) = (λpr)/(λpq) ⇒ (2/q^2)/(3/r^2) = r/q.\\nCompute LHS: (2/q^2)*(r^2/3) = 2 r^2/(3 q^2).\\nSo 2 r^2/(3 q^2) = r/q.\\nMultiply by 3 q^2: 2 r^2 = 3 r q.\\nAssuming r>0, divide by r: 2 r = 3 q.\\nThus r = (3/2) q.\\nCombine with q=2p: r = (3/2)*2 p = 3p.\\nSo at an interior critical point, p, q, r are in ratio 1 : 2 : 3, i.e. q=2p, r=3p.\\n\\n5) Use product constraint:\\nGiven pqr=48 ⇒ p*(2p)*(3p)=6 p^3=48 ⇒ p^3=8 ⇒ p=2.\\nThen q=4, r=6.\\nCheck p<q<r satisfied; all positive.\\n\\n6) Compute S at this point:\\nS = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r = 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/6.\\nCompute:\\n1/2 = 3/6.\\n2/4 = 1/2 = 3/6.\\n3/6 = 1/2 = 3/6.\\nSo S = 3/6 + 3/6 + 3/6 = 9/6 = 3/2.\\n\\n7) Verify minimality:\\nThe function S is symmetric in a weighted way but continuous on (0,∞)^3 with constraint pqr=48. We used Lagrange multipliers to find an interior critical point; we should check behavior as one root tends to 0+ or ∞.\\n- If p→0+, to keep pqr=48, at least one of q,r→∞. Then terms like 1/p or 2/q or 3/r blow up; in particular 1/p→∞, so S→∞.\\n- If one root tends to ∞, another must tend to 0+ to keep product 48, again blowing up S.\\nThus no boundary point yields a smaller finite value. So the critical point gives a global minimum on positive reals.\\n\\nThe requirement that the roots are distinct (p<q<r) is already satisfied at p=2,q=4,r=6, so the minimum is attained, not just an infimum.\\n\\nThus the minimum possible value of 1/p+2/q+3/r is 3/2.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: All integer pairs (m,n): (0,0) and (-2,2).\\nProblem 2: Minimum value: 3/2.\\n\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"(0,0), (-2,2)\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
