  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe solve m^5 - n^5 = 16mn in integers and then look for a solution where m and n have opposite signs, with n > 0, and finally compute k = n - 1.\\nRewrite the equation using the factorization m^5 - n^5 = (m - n)(m^4 + m^3 n + m^2 n^2 + m n^3 + n^4):\\n(m - n)(m^4 + m^3 n + m^2 n^2 + m n^3 + n^4) = 16mn.\\nLet S = m^4 + m^3 n + m^2 n^2 + m n^3 + n^4. Then (m - n)S = 16mn.\\nWe look for integer solutions by testing small values and checking for sign patterns.\\nIf m and n have opposite signs and n is positive, write m = -a, n = b, where a, b > 0. The equation becomes:\\n(-a)^5 - b^5 = 16(-a)b => -a^5 - b^5 = -16ab => a^5 + b^5 = 16ab.\\nSo we seek positive integers a, b > 0 such that a^5 + b^5 = 16ab.\\nBecause a^5 and b^5 grow quickly, a and b must be small. We can check small pairs.\\nTry a = 1:\\n1 + b^5 = 16b => b^5 - 16b + 1 = 0.\\nTest small b:\\n b = 1: 1 - 16 + 1 = -14 ≠ 0\\n b = 2: 32 - 32 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0\\n b = 3: 243 - 48 + 1 = 196 ≠ 0\\n b = 4: 1024 - 64 + 1 = 961 ≠ 0\\n b = 5: 3125 - 80 + 1 = 3046 ≠ 0\\nSo no solution with a = 1.\\nTry a = 2:\\n32 + b^5 = 32b => b^5 - 32b + 32 = 0.\\nCheck small b:\\n b = 1: 1 - 32 + 32 = 1 ≠ 0\\n b = 2: 32 - 64 + 32 = 0, so b = 2 is a solution.\\nThus a = 2, b = 2 gives a^5 + b^5 = 32 + 32 = 64 and 16ab = 16*2*2 = 64, so it satisfies the equation.\\nThis corresponds to m = -2, n = 2. Check in the original equation:\\nm^5 - n^5 = (-2)^5 - 2^5 = -32 - 32 = -64, and 16mn = 16 * (-2) * 2 = -64, so the equation holds.\\nNow n is positive and m, n have opposite signs as required. Compute k = n - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\\nWe should also briefly consider whether other opposite-sign solutions exist with larger a, b.\\nFor a ≥ 3 and b ≥ 1, a^5 + b^5 grows as order (max(a, b))^5, while 16ab grows as order (ab). For larger values, a^5 + b^5 > 16ab quickly; rough bounding shows no further small solutions.\\nFor example, if a ≥ 3 and b ≥ 3, then a^5 ≥ 243 and b^5 ≥ 243, so a^5 + b^5 ≥ 486, but 16ab ≤ 16 * a * b. For a = b = 3, 16ab = 144 < 486. As a and b increase, the fifth powers dominate even more, so equality is impossible.\\nFor mixed sizes (say a ≥ 3, b = 1 or 2), one can verify a few small cases directly; they fail. Thus (m, n) = (-2, 2) is the only relevant solution with n > 0 and opposite signs, and k = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have a cubic x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48 with three positive roots p < q < r.\\nBy Vieta's formulas:\\n (1) p + q + r = a\\n (2) pq + pr + qr = b\\n (3) pqr = 48.\\nWe are asked to minimize F = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r over all positive real triples (p, q, r) with p < q < r and pqr = 48.\\nFirst express F in a symmetric-looking form:\\nF = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r.\\nWe need a constrained optimization with p, q, r > 0, pqr = 48.\\nUse Lagrange multipliers. Define\\nG(p, q, r) = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r + λ(pqr - 48).\\nTake partial derivatives and set them to zero at an interior minimum:\\n∂G/∂p = -1/p^2 + λ q r = 0 => λ q r = 1/p^2.\\n∂G/∂q = -2/q^2 + λ p r = 0 => λ p r = 2/q^2.\\n∂G/∂r = -3/r^2 + λ p q = 0 => λ p q = 3/r^2.\\nWe also have the constraint p q r = 48.\\nFrom λ q r = 1/p^2, since q r = (p q r)/p = 48/p, we get:\\nλ * (48/p) = 1/p^2 => λ = 1/(48 p).\\nFrom λ p r = 2/q^2, and p r = (p q r)/q = 48/q, we get:\\nλ * (48/q) = 2/q^2 => λ = 2/(48 q) = 1/(24 q).\\nEquate these:\\n1/(48 p) = 1/(24 q) => cross-multiply: 24 q = 48 p => q = 2p.\\nSimilarly, from λ p q = 3/r^2 and p q = (p q r)/r = 48/r:\\nλ * (48/r) = 3/r^2 => λ = 3/(48 r) = 1/(16 r).\\nSet 1/(48 p) = 1/(16 r) => 16 r = 48 p => r = 3p.\\nSo at the candidate extremum, p, q, r are in arithmetic proportion p : 2p : 3p, and this ordering satisfies p < q < r automatically.\\nNow impose p q r = 48:\\np * 2p * 3p = 6 p^3 = 48 => p^3 = 8 => p = 2.\\nThen q = 4, r = 6.\\nCompute F at (p, q, r) = (2, 4, 6):\\nF = 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/6 = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3/2.\\nWe should check that this is indeed a minimum. The function is smooth on the positive orthant, and the constraint p q r = 48 defines a smooth surface. In the region p, q, r > 0, any local extremum subject to the constraint must satisfy the Lagrange multiplier conditions, which we used. Potential minima on the boundary would involve one of p, q, r approaching 0 or infinity, but these are not allowed: roots are positive and finite, and approaching the boundary makes some terms of F blow up, so they do not yield lower values.\\nThus the point (2, 4, 6) is the unique interior critical point in the region p < q < r, and F there equals 3/2. Hence the minimum possible value of 1/p + 2/q + 3/r is 3/2.\\n\\nFinal answers: Problem 1 gives k = 1. Problem 2 gives minimum value 3/2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
