Then (m - n)S = 16mn.\\n\\n   The magnitudes grow quickly, so only small |m|,|n| are plausible.\\n\\n2) Brute force search by hand for |m|,|n| up to 3 or 4:\\n   - Try n = 0: then m^5 = 0 ⇒ m = 0, gives (0,0).\\n   - n = 1: equation is m^5 - 1 = 16m ⇒ m^5 - 16m - 1 = 0.\\n       m = 2: 32 - 32 - 1 = -1\\n       m = 3: 243 - 48 - 1 = 194\\n       m = -1: -1 + 16 - 1 = 14\\n       m = -2: -32 + 32 - 1 = -1\\n       So no integer root.\\n   - n = -1: m^5 + 1 = -16m ⇒ m^5 + 16m + 1 = 0, check small m:\\n       m = -1: -1 -16 +1 = -16\\n       m = 0: 0 +0 +1 =1\\n       m = 1: 1 +16 +1 =18  ⇒ no root.\\n   - n = 2: m^5 - 32 = 32m ⇒ m^5 - 32m - 32 = 0.\\n       Try integer divisors of 32:\\n       m = 2: 32 -64 -32 = -64\\n       m = 4: 1024 -128 -32 = 864\\n       m = -2: -32 +64 -32 =0 ⇒ solution m = -2.\\n   So (m,n)=(-2,2) is a solution.\\n\\n   Check that it satisfies the equation: (-2)^5 - 2^5 = -32 -32 = -64, and 16mn = 16*(-2)*2 = -64. Works.\\n\\n   - n = -2: m^5 - (-32) = -32m ⇒ m^5 +32 = -32m ⇒ m^5 +32m +32=0.\\n       Test divisors of 32:\\n       m = -2: -32 -64 +32 = -64\\n       m = 2: 32 +64 +32 =128 ⇒ no root.\\n   - n = 3: m^5 - 243 = 48m ⇒ m^5 -48m -243=0.\\n       Try divisors of 243: ±1,3,9,27,81,243.\\n       m = 3: 243 -144 -243 = -144\\n       m = 9: 59049 -432 -243 = large positive ⇒ unlikely to hit 0 in between integer divisors; test others quickly:\\n       m = 1: 1 -48 -243 = -290\\n       m = -1: -1 +48 -243 = -196\\n       m = -3: -243 +144 -243 = -342\\n       Hence no integer root.\\n\\n   Symmetry suggests no further nontrivial integer solutions beyond (0,0) and (-2,2). A more systematic search over small integers confirms only these two.\\n\\n   The problem further specifies \\\"n is the positive integer appearing in the solution pair with variables of opposite signs\\\", which refers to (-2,2), so n = 2.\\n\\n   Thus k = n - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\\n\\n3) Second part: polynomial x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48 with positive roots p<q<r and we want to minimize\\n      E = k/p + 2/q + 3/r.\\n   From above, k = 1, so we minimize\\n      E = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r.\\n\\n   Use Vieta’s relations for roots p,q,r of x^3 - a x^2 + b x -48 = 0:\\n      p + q + r = a,\\n      pq + pr + qr = b,\\n      pqr = 48.\\n   Only the constant term is fixed, so pqr = 48 with p,q,r >0.\\n   We must find positive reals p<q<r, pqr=48, minimizing E.\\n\\n4) Use inequality methods with symmetry:\\n   First consider the unconstrained symmetric case p=q=r. Then from p^3 =48 ⇒ p = 48^{1/3}.\\n   Then E = 1/p + 2/p + 3/p = 6/p = 6 / 48^{1/3}.\\n   Since 48 = 16·3 = 2^4·3, we have 48^{1/3} = 2^{4/3} 3^{1/3}.\\n   So in the symmetric case E_sym = 6 / (2^{4/3}3^{1/3}).\\n\\n   But we also must enforce p<q<r, so p,q,r cannot be equal. However, by continuity, any strict ordering can be made arbitrarily close to the equal-root case while keeping pqr fixed at 48.\\n\\n   It remains to argue that the symmetry point p=q=r gives the global minimum of E under the constraint pqr=48, p,q,r>0 (ignoring temporary ordering), and then the infimum over p<q<r equals this minimum.\\n\\n5) Prove minimality at p=q=r using optimization under constraint:\\n   Consider F(p,q,r) = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r with constraint G(p,q,r) = ln p + ln q + ln r - ln 48 = 0 (equivalent to pqr = 48).\\n   Use Lagrange multipliers:\\n      ∂F/∂p = -1/p^2,  ∂G/∂p = 1/p,\\n      ∂F/∂q = -2/q^2,  ∂G/∂q = 1/q,\\n      ∂F/∂r = -3/r^2,  ∂G/∂r = 1/r.\\n   Stationary point conditions:\\n      -1/p^2 = λ(1/p)  ⇒ λ = -1/p,\\n      -2/q^2 = λ(1/q)  ⇒ λ = -2/q,\\n      -3/r^2 = λ(1/r)  ⇒ λ = -3/r.\\n   Equating these: -1/p = -2/q = -3/r ⇒ 1/p = 2/q = 3/r.\\n   Hence q = 2p, r = 3p.\\n   Then the constraint p·2p·3p = 6p^3 = 48 ⇒ p^3 = 8 ⇒ p=2, q=4, r=6.\\n   This gives a stationary point with p<q<r.\\n\\n   Evaluate E at (2,4,6): E = 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/6 = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3/2.\\n\\n   Note this E=3/2 is larger than the symmetric value 6/48^{1/3}. Numerically, 48^{1/3}≈3.634, so 6/48^{1/3}≈1.651, which is actually larger than 3/2? Let's check carefully:\\n      48^{1/3} ≈ 3.634240, so 6 / 3.634240 ≈ 1.651317.\\n   Compare 1.651317 vs 1.5; 1.5 is smaller.\\n   Thus (2,4,6) gives a smaller value 3/2 than the equal-root value.\\n\\n   However, at p=q=r we would have q≠2p or r≠3p, so the Lagrange multiplier solution for F with that specific weight (1,2,3) is (2,4,6), not equal roots. So p=q=r is not a stationary point of F with those weights. The earlier symmetric test was only heuristic; the true extremum is given by Lagrange multipliers as (2,4,6).\\n\\n6) Verify that (p,q,r)=(2,4,6) satisfies pqr=48 and ordering p<q<r, which is okay.\\n   Then the corresponding polynomial is (x-2)(x-4)(x-6) = x^3 - 12x^2 + 44x - 48,\\n   so a=12, b=44 (both real, no restriction beyond that). This matches the form x^3 - a x^2 + b x -48.\\n   So (2,4,6) is an admissible triple.\\n\\n7) Check minimality:\\n   The Lagrange multiplier method has found the only interior critical point under p>0,q>0,r>0 and pqr=48. To ensure this is a minimum, we can argue:\\n   - As any of p,q,r → 0+ or →∞ while keeping product 48, some term in E = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r blows up, so no minima on the boundary.\\n   - Thus the interior critical point (2,4,6) must be a global minimum.\\n\\n   Hence the minimum of E over all positive p,q,r with pqr=48 is 3/2, attained at (2,4,6), which already satisfies p<q<r.\\n\\n8) Therefore k = 1 and the minimal possible value of k/p + 2/q + 3/r is 3/2.\\n\\n   The problem asks specifically for the minimum possible value of k/p+2/q+3/r, so the final answer is 3/2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3/2\"\n}",
