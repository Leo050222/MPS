We need to count how many k satisfy this.\\n\\nStep 1: Prime factorization of 205800 and 35.\\n35 = 5 * 7.\\nFactor 205800:\\n205800 = 2058 * 100 = 2058 * (2^2 * 5^2).\\nNow factor 2058:\\n2058 = 2 * 1029.\\n1029 = 3 * 343.\\n343 = 7^3.\\nSo 2058 = 2 * 3 * 7^3.\\nThus\\n205800 = 2058 * 2^2 * 5^2 = (2 * 3 * 7^3) * 2^2 * 5^2 = 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^2 * 7^3.\\nSo:\\n205800 = 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^2 * 7^3\\n35 = 5^1 * 7^1\\nThen\\n35k = 5 * 7 * k.\\nWrite the prime factorization of k as:\\nk = 2^a * 3^b * 5^c * 7^d * r,\\nwhere r is coprime to 2,3,5,7.\\nThen\\n35k = 5^1 * 7^1 * 2^a * 3^b * 5^c * 7^d * r = 2^a * 3^b * 5^{c+1} * 7^{d+1} * r.\\n\\nStep 2: GCD exponents.\\nWe only need the primes that appear in 205800: 2, 3, 5, 7. Because any prime factor in 35k not in 205800 will not appear in the gcd.\\nFor each prime p in {2,3,5,7}, let e_p(205800) be its exponent in 205800 and e_p(35k) its exponent in 35k. Then the exponent of p in gcd(205800,35k) is min(e_p(205800), e_p(35k)).\\nWe compute:\\n- e_2(205800) = 3, e_3(205800) = 1, e_5(205800) = 2, e_7(205800) = 3.\\n- e_2(35k) = a,\\n  e_3(35k) = b,\\n  e_5(35k) = c + 1,\\n  e_7(35k) = d + 1.\\nSo the gcd exponents are:\\n- For prime 2:    min(3, a)\\n- For prime 3:    min(1, b)\\n- For prime 5:    min(2, c+1)\\n- For prime 7:    min(3, d+1)\\nWe also have that r is coprime with 2,3,5,7, so any primes dividing r do not appear in gcd.\\n\\nA positive integer is a perfect square iff all prime exponents in its factorization are even. So we require:\\n(1) min(3, a) is even\\n(2) min(1, b) is even\\n(3) min(2, c+1) is even\\n(4) min(3, d+1) is even\\nWe will translate these conditions into conditions on a, b, c, d.\\n\\nStep 3: Condition on prime 2.\\nWe need min(3, a) even.\\nConsider cases:\\n- If a >= 3, then min(3, a) = 3, which is odd. That is invalid.\\n- If a ≤ 3, then min(3, a) = a. We need a even.\\nThus a can be 0, 2 only (since a ≥ 0 and a ≤ 2; a = 1 gives exponent 1, odd, and a = 3 invalid as noted). Actually if a=3, exponent is 3 (odd) so not allowed.\\nTherefore allowed a values: a ∈ {0, 2}.\\n\\nStep 4: Condition on prime 3.\\nWe need min(1, b) even.\\n- If b = 0, min(1,0) = 0, which is even; allowed.\\n- If b ≥ 1, min(1,b) = 1, which is odd; not allowed.\\nTherefore b must be 0.\\nSo 3 cannot divide k.\\n\\nStep 5: Condition on prime 5.\\nWe need min(2, c+1) even.\\nConsider c ≥ 0 integer.\\n- If c+1 ≤ 2, i.e., c=0 or c=1:\\n  * c=0 → c+1=1, min(2,1)=1 (odd) → not allowed.\\n  * c=1 → c+1=2, min(2,2)=2 (even) → allowed.\\n- If c+1 ≥ 2, i.e., c≥1:\\n  For c ≥ 1, min(2, c+1) = 2, since c+1 ≥2. So exponent is 2, which is even, so all c ≥1 are allowed except we must exclude c=0 case already checked.\\nThus allowed c are c ≥ 1. There is no theoretical upper limit from the square condition.\\nSo c ∈ {1,2,3,...}.\\n\\nStep 6: Condition on prime 7.\\nWe need min(3, d+1) even.\\nConsider d ≥ 0 integer.\\n- If d+1 ≤ 3, i.e., d=0,1,2:\\n  * d=0 → d+1=1, min(3,1)=1 (odd) → not allowed.\\n  * d=1 → d+1=2, min(3,2)=2 (even) → allowed.\\n  * d=2 → d+1=3, min(3,3)=3 (odd) → not allowed.\\n- If d+1 ≥ 3, i.e., d ≥ 2:\\n  For d ≥ 2, min(3, d+1) = 3 (since d+1≥3), which is odd and not allowed.\\nSo the only allowed value is d = 1.\\n\\nSo from square conditions we have:\\na ∈ {0, 2}\\n b = 0\\n c ≥ 1\\n d = 1\\nAnd r is coprime to 2,3,5,7 without any further restriction from the square condition.\\nNow we add the constraint k ≤ 2940.\\nRecall:\\nk = 2^a * 3^b * 5^c * 7^d * r,\\nwith restrictions above and gcd(r,2·3·5·7)=1.\\nPlugging in b=0, d=1:\\nk = 2^a * 5^c * 7 * r,\\nwith a ∈ {0,2}, c ≥ 1, and r has no factor 2,3,5,7, and k ≤ 2940.\\nOur job is to count such k.\\n\\nStep 7: Handle r via inequality.\\nLet us handle case-by-case for a.\\nCase A: a = 0.\\nThen k = 5^c * 7 * r.\\nSo k = 7 * 5^c * r.\\nCondition: k ≤ 2940 ⇒ 7 * 5^c * r ≤ 2940 ⇒ 5^c * r ≤ 2940 / 7.\\nCompute 2940 / 7 = 420.\\nSo we need 5^c * r ≤ 420.\\nAlso c ≥ 1, gcd(r, 2·3·5·7) =1.\\nLet S = 420.\\nWe count all pairs (c, r) with c ≥ 1 integer, r positive integer, gcd(r,210)=1 (since 2·3·5·7 = 210), and 5^c * r ≤ 420.\\nSince 5^c grows quickly, we can list possible c values such that 5^c ≤ 420.\\n5^1=5, 5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625>420.\\nSo c ∈ {1,2,3}.\\nFor each c, we need r ≤ 420 / 5^c and gcd(r,210)=1.\\n\\nCase A1: a=0, c=1.\\nThen 5^c = 5, so r ≤ 420/5 = 84.\\nWe need r positive integer ≤84, with gcd(r,210)=1.\\nSince 210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7. Thus r must be coprime to 2,3,5,7.\\nWe count numbers 1 ≤ r ≤ 84 coprime with 210.\\nThis is a standard inclusion-exclusion / totient-in-interval computation.\\nLet N = 84.\\nWe want count of integers ≤ N not divisible by any of 2,3,5,7.\\nUse inclusion-exclusion:\\nTotal = N - (N/2 + N/3 + N/5 + N/7) + (N/lcm pairs) - (N/lcm triples) + (N/210).\\nHere [x] denotes floor(x).\\nCompute floors:\\nN=84.\\nDivisible by 2: floor(84/2)=42.\\n3: floor(84/3)=28.\\n5: floor(84/5)=16.\\n7: floor(84/7)=12.\\nSum singles = 42+28+16+12=98.\\nPairs lcm counts:\\n- lcm(2,3)=6: floor(84/6)=14.\\n- lcm(2,5)=10: floor(84/10)=8.\\n- lcm(2,7)=14: floor(84/14)=6.\\n- lcm(3,5)=15: floor(84/15)=5.\\n- lcm(3,7)=21: floor(84/21)=4.\\n- lcm(5,7)=35: floor(84/35)=2.\\nSum pairs = 14+8+6+5+4+2=39.\\nTriples lcm counts:\\n- lcm(2,3,5)=30: floor(84/30)=2.\\n- lcm(2,3,7)=42: floor(84/42)=2.\\n- lcm(2,5,7)=70: floor(84/70)=1.\\n- lcm(3,5,7)=105: floor(84/105)=0.\\nSum triples = 2+2+1+0=5.\\nQuadruple lcm(2,3,5,7)=210 ⇒ floor(84/210)=0.\\nSo by inclusion-exclusion, count coprime to 2,3,5,7 is:\\nN - singles + pairs - triples + quadruple\\n= 84 - 98 + 39 - 5 + 0\\n= 84 - 98 = -14; -14+39=25; 25-5=20.\\nSo there are 20 valid r in this case.\\nThus, for (a=0, c=1), we have 20 values of r, hence 20 values of k.\\n\\nCase A2: a=0, c=2.\\n5^c = 25; we need r ≤ 420/25 = 16.8 ⇒ r ≤16.\\nAgain, r coprime to 2,3,5,7.\\nSo we count numbers 1 ≤ r ≤ 16 not divisible by 2,3,5,7.\\nList or use inclusion-exclusion quickly.\\nTotal 16.\\nDivisible by 2: floor(16/2)=8.\\n3: floor(16/3)=5.\\n5: floor(16/5)=3.\\n7: floor(16/7)=2.\\nSum singles = 8+5+3+2 = 18.\\nPairs:\\n- lcm(2,3)=6: floor(16/6)=2.\\n- lcm(2,5)=10: floor(16/10)=1.\\n- lcm(2,7)=14: floor(16/14)=1.\\n- lcm(3,5)=15: floor(16/15)=1.\\n- lcm(3,7)=21: floor(16/21)=0.\\n- lcm(5,7)=35: floor(16/35)=0.\\nSum pairs = 2+1+1+1+0+0=5.\\nTriples:\\n- lcm(2,3,5)=30: floor(16/30)=0.\\n- lcm(2,3,7)=42: 0.\\n- lcm(2,5,7)=70: 0.\\n- lcm(3,5,7)=105:0.\\nSum triples =0.\\nQuadruple: floor(16/210)=0.\\nSo count = 16 - 18 + 5 - 0 + 0 = 3.\\nWe can check by listing numbers from 1 to 16 not divisible by 2,3,5,7: 1,11,13; indeed 3.\\nThus for (a=0, c=2) we have 3 k values.\\n\\nCase A3: a=0, c=3.\\n5^3 = 125; we need r ≤ 420/125 = 3.36 ⇒ r ≤3.\\nWe need r coprime to 2,3,5,7.\\nNumbers 1 to 3: 1,2,3. Of these, 1 is coprime, 2 divisible by 2, 3 divisible by 3. So only r=1.\\nThus 1 k value here.\\nNo larger c possible since 5^4 > 420.\\nSo for Case A (a=0), total number of k is:\\n20 + 3 + 1 = 24.\\n\\nCase B: a = 2.\\nThen k=2^2 * 5^c * 7 * r = 4 * 5^c * 7 * r.\\nSo k = 28 * 5^c * r.\\nCondition: k ≤ 2940 ⇒ 28 * 5^c * r ≤ 2940 ⇒ 5^c * r ≤ 2940 / 28.\\nCompute 2940 / 28: 28*100=2800, residual 140, so 28*105 = 2940. So 2940/28 = 105.\\nThus 5^c * r ≤ 105.\\nAgain c ≥ 1, gcd(r,210)=1.\\nWe need 5^c ≤ 105. As before, 5^1=5, 5^2=25, 5^3=125>105. So c ∈ {1,2}.\\n\\nCase B1: a=2, c=1.\\n5^1=5; we need r ≤ 105/5 = 21.\\nWe count r, 1 ≤ r ≤ 21, gcd(r,210)=1; i.e., r not divisible by 2,3,5,7.\\nUse inclusion-exclusion with N=21.\\nDivisible by 2: floor(21/2)=10.\\n3: floor(21/3)=7.\\n5: floor(21/5)=4.\\n7: floor(21/7)=3.\\nSum singles = 10+7+4+3=24.\\nPairs:\\n- lcm(2,3)=6: floor(21/6)=3.\\n- lcm(2,5)=10: floor(21/10)=2.\\n- lcm(2,7)=14: floor(21/14)=1.\\n- lcm(3,5)=15: floor(21/15)=1.\\n- lcm(3,7)=21: floor(21/21)=1.\\n- lcm(5,7)=35: floor(21/35)=0.\\nSum pairs = 3+2+1+1+1+0=8.\\nTriples:\\n- lcm(2,3,5)=30: floor(21/30)=0.\\n- lcm(2,3,7)=42: 0.\\n- lcm(2,5,7)=70: 0.\\n- lcm(3,5,7)=105:0.\\nSum triples =0.\\nQuadruple lcm=210: floor(21/210)=0.\\nSo count = N - singles + pairs - triples + quadruple = 21 -24 +8 -0 +0 =5.\\nWe can confirm by listing 1..21 eliminating multiples of 2,3,5,7:\\n1 (ok), 2 (×2), 3 (×3), 4 (×2), 5 (×5), 6 (×2,3), 7 (×7), 8 (×2), 9 (×3), 10 (×2,5), 11 (ok), 12 (×2,3), 13 (ok), 14 (×2,7), 15 (×3,5), 16 (×2), 17 (ok), 18 (×2,3), 19 (ok), 20 (×2,5), 21 (×3,7). Remaining: 1,11,13,17,19: 5 numbers.\\nThus for (a=2, c=1), we have 5 k values.\\n\\nCase B2: a=2, c=2.\\n5^2=25; we need r ≤ 105/25 = 4.2 ⇒ r ≤ 4.\\nWe need r coprime to 2,3,5,7.\\nNumbers 1..4: 1,2,3,4. Of these, 1 only is coprime; 2 is divisible by 2, 3 by 3, 4 by 2.\\nSo 1 value.\\nThus for Case B (a=2), total k = 5 + 1 = 6.\\n\\nTotal number of possible k values is Case A + Case B = 24 + 6 = 30.\\nTherefore the answer to Problem 2 is 30.\\n\\nFinal results:\\nProblem 1: N = 2900.\\nProblem 2: number of possible k = 30.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2900\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"30\"\n}",
