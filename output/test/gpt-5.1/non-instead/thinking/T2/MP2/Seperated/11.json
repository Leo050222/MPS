  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe have 6 distinguishable sushi pieces arranged in a 2×3 grid:\\nLabel positions:\\n1 2 3\\n4 5 6\\nAdjacencies (up/down/left/right):\\n1: {2,4} (deg 2)\\n2: {1,3,5} (deg 3)\\n3: {2,6} (deg 2)\\n4: {1,5} (deg 2)\\n5: {2,4,6} (deg 3)\\n6: {3,5} (deg 2)\\nA piece can be eaten only if, among the pieces still present, it has at most 2 neighbors. Initially, positions 2 and 5 each have 3 neighbors, so they cannot be eaten first.\\n\\nBecause all pieces are distinguishable but the adjacency structure depends only on positions, we can count valid sequences of positions and then multiply by 6! for labels.\\n\\nWe perform a backtracking count over permutations of {1,2,3,4,5,6}, checking at each step that the chosen position has remaining-degree ≤ 2. Let S be the set of remaining positions; the degree of v in S is |neighbors(v) ∩ S|.\\n\\nStep 1: Initial allowed positions: {1,3,4,6} (since 2 and 5 have degree 3). By symmetry, there are two orbits under the grid’s symmetries: corners not sharing an edge (1 and 6) and corners sharing an edge (1 and 3). We must still compute explicitly because later available-move sets differ.\\n\\nCase A: Start at 1.\\nAfter removing 1, remaining graph on {2,3,4,5,6} has degrees: 2:{3,5} (2), 3:{2,6} (2), 4:{5} (1), 5:{2,4,6} (3), 6:{3,5} (2). So only 5 is forbidden at step 2.\\n\\nFrom there we examine second moves:\\nA1: 1,2.\\nRemaining {3,4,5,6}. Degrees: 3:{6} (1), 4:{5} (1), 5:{4,6} (2), 6:{3,5} (2). All allowed.\\nWe branch by third moves and count full valid sequences (always checking degrees). This is tedious by hand, so structure is useful. However, a quicker method is to enumerate systematically but also compare with symmetric cases.\\nInstead of continuing raw tree expansion, observe that the constraints are mild: only vertices 2 and 5 can ever have degree 3, and that only happens while all their neighbors remain. They lose degree as soon as at least one neighbor is eaten.\\n\\nThus 2 is forbidden exactly when {1,3,5} are all present, and 5 is forbidden exactly when {2,4,6} are all present. At any step, a position v is forbidden iff it is 2 or 5 and all 3 of its neighbors are still uneaten. All other positions are always allowed as long as they exist.\\n\\nWe now characterize position sequences by when these forbidden states occur. Represent the process by tracking which neighbors of 2 and 5 have been removed.\\nLet the positions be eaten in order x1,…,x6. For each k, define S_k = {x_k,…,x_6} the remaining set after eating the first k−1. The condition is:\\n- For all k with x_k ∈ {2,5}, the neighbor set of x_k is not contained in S_k (i.e., at least one neighbor already eaten).\\nEquivalently:\\n- 2 cannot appear before at least one of {1,3,5}.\\n- 5 cannot appear before at least one of {2,4,6}.\\n\\nTranslate to ordering constraints:\\nFor 2: it must not be the earliest among {1,2,3,5}. So in the linear order, the first of {1,2,3,5} cannot be 2.\\nFor 5: it must not be the earliest among {2,4,5,6}.\\nNo other constraints.\\n\\nLet us count permutations of {1,2,3,4,5,6} satisfying both:\\nC1: 2 is not the earliest in {1,2,3,5}.\\nC2: 5 is not the earliest in {2,4,5,6}.\\n\\nTotal permutations: 6! = 720.\\nDefine events:\\nA = {2 is earliest of {1,2,3,5}}.\\nB = {5 is earliest of {2,4,5,6}}.\\nValid permutations = 720 − |A ∪ B| = 720 − (|A|+|B|−|A∩B|).\\n\\nCompute |A|: Among {1,2,3,5}, choose their relative earliest to be 2. The earliest among these 4 must be 2; the other 3 and the remaining 2 elements {4,6} can be arranged arbitrarily.\\nProbability that 2 is earliest among 4 specific labels in a random permutation is 1/4, so |A| = 720/4 = 180.\\nSimilarly, for B, the probability that 5 is earliest among {2,4,5,6} is also 1/4, so |B| = 180.\\n\\nNow |A∩B|: we require that 2 is earliest in {1,2,3,5} and 5 is earliest in {2,4,5,6}. We condition on the relative order of the 6 elements.\\nWork directly: consider the induced partial order constraints for A and B.\\nFor A: 2 must come before 1,3,5.\\nFor B: 5 must come before 2,4,6.\\nThus we have two chains: 5 < 2 < {1,3} (with 1 and 3 unconstrained between themselves), and 5 < 4,5 < 6, and 2 must be after 5 but before 1,3; 4 and 6 only need to be after 5 (no relation with 2,1,3 among themselves except via 5 and 2 constraints).\\nSo the only mandatory ordering relations:\\n5 is before 2,1,3,4,6.\\n2 is before 1,3.\\nThere is no relation between {4,6} and {2,1,3} other than all are after 5.\\nConsider the 5 positions after 5; among these 5 slots we must place the remaining labels {1,2,3,4,6}. The condition is: in the relative order of these 5, 2 comes before 1 and 3. This is a simple probability: among {1,2,3}, the probability that 2 is first is 1/3; 4 and 6 can be anywhere.\\nHence P(A∩B) = P(5 is earliest among all 6) * P(2 earliest among {1,2,3} in remaining positions).\\nBut 5 need not be globally first, only first among its comparison set {2,4,5,6}. More carefully: A∩B does not force 5 to be earliest overall, just earliest among {2,4,5,6}. Direct pairwise probabilities are easier.\\nInstead, use symmetry on full 6-element permutations:\\n- Among {1,2,3,5}, probability that 2 is earliest is 1/4.\\n- Among {2,4,5,6}, probability that 5 is earliest is 1/4.\\nHowever, these events are not independent.\\n\\nBetter: explicitly treat the permutation positions 1…6.\\nChoose the relative order under constraints: 5 must precede {2,1,3,4,6}, 2 must precede {1,3}. That means 5 is the earliest of {1,2,3,4,5,6} or at least before 2,1,3,4,6, but that is the entire set, so 5 must actually be first overall. So 5 occupies some position k and all others after? Wait: 5 must be before 2,1,3,4,6, which are all the other labels, so 5 is indeed first in the global permutation.\\nThus 5 must be at position 1.\\nRemaining 5 positions hold {1,2,3,4,6} with only constraint 2 before 1 and 3. Among their 5! permutations, the probability that 2 is earliest among {1,2,3} is 1/3, so count = 5! * (1/3) = 120/3 = 40.\\nTherefore |A∩B| = 40.\\n\\nThen |A ∪ B| = 180+180−40 = 320.\\nHence valid permutations of positions: 720−320 = 400.\\n\\nSo the number of valid position orders is 400.\\nEach position permutation can be labeled with 6! distinguishable sushi pieces independently, giving 400 * 6! total eating orders.\\n6! = 720, so total = 400 * 720 = 288000.\\n\\nTherefore, Problem 1 answer: 288000.\\n\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe choose a,b independently uniformly in [0,1]. We want the probability that side lengths (a,b,1) form an obtuse triangle.\\n\\nFirst, triangle inequalities. With sides a,b,1, we need:\\n(1) a + b > 1,\\n(2) a + 1 > b (always true since a,b ≤ 1 so 1+a > b),\\n(3) b + 1 > a (always since b+1 ≥ 1 > a unless a=1,b=0, but even then 1>1? Actually a is ≤1 so b+1 ≥1≥ a; equality at a=1,b=0 gives 1>1? No, we need >; at (1,0), b+1=1 equals a, but this point is measure zero, so we can ignore; the inequality holds almost everywhere). So the only effective triangle constraint is a+b>1, with 0≤a,b≤1.\\n\\nNow obtuse triangle condition: For sides with largest side c, triangle is obtuse iff c^2 > a^2 + b^2 (where a,b are other sides). In our case, the largest side might be 1 or one of a,b if they exceed 1, but a,b∈[0,1], so 1 is the largest or tied. Thus c=1 is the largest side almost everywhere (ties have measure zero). So obtuse condition is:\\n1^2 > a^2 + b^2  ⇒  a^2 + b^2 < 1.\\n\\nTherefore we want P(a,b in [0,1]^2 such that a+b>1 and a^2+b^2<1).\\nGeometrically: the region is the intersection of the unit quarter disk a^2+b^2<1 in the first quadrant with the upper-left part above the line a+b=1 inside the unit square.\\n\\nWe compute the area of this region R in the unit square.\\nEquation of line: b = 1 − a.\\nCircle: b = sqrt(1 − a^2).\\nIntersection points of the line and circle in [0,1]^2 satisfy:\\n(1−a)^2 + a^2 = 1.\\nExpand: 1 − 2a + a^2 + a^2 = 1 ⇒ 2a^2 − 2a = 0 ⇒ 2a(a−1) = 0 ⇒ a=0 or a=1.\\nAt a=0, b=1; at a=1, b=0. Both are endpoints of the quarter circle and segment.\\nOn (0,1), compare which curve is higher: choose a=1/2. Then line gives b=1/2, circle gives b = sqrt(1 − 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) ≈ 0.866 > 0.5. So in the interval (0,1), the circle lies above the line.\\nRegion a^2 + b^2<1 means points inside circle (below upper boundary b= sqrt(1 − a^2)), and a+b>1 means b>1−a. So between the two curves, b lies between the line and circle for a∈(0,1), i.e., 1−a < b < sqrt(1 − a^2).\\nThus the desired area is integral over the range of a where 1−a < sqrt(1−a^2). But we already know this holds for all a∈(0,1), and the interval of a comes from intersection within the square: we must have 0≤a≤1 and 0≤b≤1; here both conditions meet. Check endpoints: at a=0, both give b=1; at a=1, b=0; between them, inequality holds.\\nHence region R is:\\nR = {(a,b): 0≤a≤1, 1−a < b < sqrt(1−a^2)}.\\nArea = ∫_0^1 [sqrt(1−a^2) − (1−a)] da.\\n\\nSo probability = area (since total possible region is [0,1]^2 with area 1).\\nCompute the integral:\\nI = ∫_0^1 sqrt(1−a^2) da − ∫_0^1 (1−a) da.\\n\\nFirst term: ∫_0^1 sqrt(1−a^2) da is the area of a quarter unit circle of radius 1, which is π/4.\\nSecond term: ∫_0^1 (1−a) da = [a − a^2/2]_0^1 = (1 − 1/2) − 0 = 1/2.\\nThus I = π/4 − 1/2.\\n\\nTherefore the probability that (a,b,1) form an obtuse triangle is π/4 − 1/2.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: 288000.\\nProblem 2: π/4 − 1/2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"288000\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"pi/4-1/2\"\n}",
