She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, but sushi is sticky, and Wendy can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi, assuming that the pieces of sushi are distinguishable? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe have a 2×3 grid of sushi pieces, labeled as follows:\\nTop row: A B C (left to right)\\nBottom row: D E F (left to right)\\nEdges (adjacency graph) are between horizontally/vertically adjacent pieces:\\nA–B, B–C (top row); D–E, E–F (bottom row); A–D, B–E, C–F (vertical).\\n\\nWe are told: “simply find k = deg(F) + 0, where deg(F) is the degree of the bottom-right piece F in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row.”\\n\\nEndpoint pieces of the top row are A and C. Remove A and C from the graph; consider the induced subgraph on {B, D, E, F} and compute deg(F) there.\\n\\nOriginally F is adjacent to E and C. After removing A and C, F loses adjacency to C, but still is adjacent to E. There are no other neighbors of F. Thus in the induced subgraph on {B, D, E, F}, F has degree 1.\\nTherefore k = deg(F) + 0 = 1.\\n\\nSo for Problem 1, the required value is 1.\\n\\n---\\nProblem 2:\\nWe choose real numbers a, b independently and uniformly from [0,1]. We want the probability that a, b, and 1 form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle.\\n\\n1) Triangle inequalities with side 1:\\nLet the sides be a, b, 1. For them to form a triangle, the triangle inequalities are:\\n(a) a + b > 1\\n(b) a + 1 > b ⇒ always true for a∈[0,1], b∈[0,1]\\n(c) b + 1 > a ⇒ always true for a∈[0,1], b∈[0,1]\\nSo the only nontrivial condition is a + b > 1.\\nSince a, b ≤ 1 and 1 is the largest side, the side of length 1 is the largest side.\\n\\n2) Condition for obtuseness:\\nFor a triangle with sides (a, b, 1) and largest side 1, the triangle is obtuse iff the angle opposite side 1 is obtuse. Let that angle be C. By the law of cosines:\\n1^2 = a^2 + b^2 − 2ab cos C.\\nRearrange:\\ncos C = (a^2 + b^2 − 1)/(2ab).\\nAngle C is obtuse iff cos C < 0 ⇒ a^2 + b^2 − 1 < 0 ⇒ a^2 + b^2 < 1.\\nThus within the region where a, b, 1 form a triangle (a + b > 1), we need a^2 + b^2 < 1.\\n\\nSummary of conditions:\\n- (i) a, b in [0,1]\\n- (ii) a + b > 1 (triangle exists)\\n- (iii) a^2 + b^2 < 1 (obtuse at side 1)\\nWe must find the area of the region S = {(a,b) ∈ [0,1]^2 : a + b > 1 and a^2 + b^2 < 1} and divide by area of the sample space [0,1]^2, which is 1.\\n\\n3) Geometry of the region:\\nThe unit square [0,1]^2 is in the first quadrant. The line a + b = 1 cuts the square from (0,1) to (1,0). The region a + b > 1 is the upper-right triangle with vertices (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\\nThe circle a^2 + b^2 = 1 centered at the origin passes through (1,0) and (0,1). Inside the square, the region a^2 + b^2 < 1 is the quarter disk of radius 1 in the first quadrant, from (1,0) through (0,1).\\nWe want the intersection of:\\n- Region above the line: a + b > 1.\\n- Region inside the quarter circle: a^2 + b^2 < 1.\\nOn [0,1]^2, the entire line segment (0,1)–(1,0) lies on the circle (since a^2 + b^2 = 1 there). For points in the quarter disk between that line and the arc, we need to locate where the line and circle intersect in the first quadrant; that intersection set is exactly that segment. The region a + b > 1, a^2 + b^2 < 1 is the “cap” of the quarter disk above the line a + b = 1.\\n\\nThis region is in the square with both a,b in [0,1]. Notice for a∈[0,1], if b is between the line and the circle, we need:\\n- a^2 + b^2 < 1 ⇒ b < sqrt(1 − a^2)\\n- a + b > 1 ⇒ b > 1 − a.\\nSo for each a where these bounds make sense, b ranges from 1 − a up to sqrt(1 − a^2).\\nWe must find values of a for which 1 − a < sqrt(1 − a^2) and both bounds stay in [0,1].\\n\\nSolve 1 − a = sqrt(1 − a^2) with 0 ≤ a ≤ 1:\\nSquare both sides:\\n(1 − a)^2 = 1 − a^2\\n1 − 2a + a^2 = 1 − a^2\\n−2a + a^2 = −a^2\\n2a^2 − 2a = 0\\n2a(a − 1) = 0 ⇒ a = 0 or a = 1.\\nWe know at a=0, b=1; at a=1, b=0. So between a=0 and a=1, we have (since at, say, a=1/2, 1−a=1/2 and sqrt(1−a^2)=sqrt(3/4)≈0.866, so 1−a<sqrt(1−a^2)), the inequality is 1 − a < sqrt(1 − a^2). Thus for 0 < a < 1, the allowable b-interval (1 − a, sqrt(1 − a^2)) is nonempty.\\nAlso, for a∈(0,1), both endpoints lie between 0 and 1, so we can integrate a from 0 to 1.\\n\\n4) Area computation:\\nThe desired probability is the area of S:\\nP = ∫_{a=0}^{1} [sqrt(1 − a^2) − (1 − a)] da.\\nSplit the integral:\\nP = ∫_{0}^{1} sqrt(1 − a^2) da − ∫_{0}^{1} (1 − a) da.\\nCompute separately.\\n\\nFirst integral: ∫_{0}^{1} sqrt(1 − a^2) da is the area under the quarter circle of radius 1 from 0 to 1 in the first quadrant. That area is π/4.\\nAlternatively, known standard integral: ∫ sqrt(1 − x^2) dx from 0 to 1 = π/4.\\n\\nSecond integral: ∫_{0}^{1} (1 − a) da = [a − a^2/2]_{0}^{1} = (1 − 1/2) − 0 = 1/2.\\n\\nTherefore:\\nP = π/4 − 1/2.\\nThis is the probability that a, b, and 1 form an obtuse triangle.\\n\\nSo the final answers are:\\nProblem 1: 1\\nProblem 2: (π/4 − 1/2)\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"pi/4-1/2\"\n}",
