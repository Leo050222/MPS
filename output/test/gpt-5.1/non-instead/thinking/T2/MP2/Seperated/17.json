Divide both sides by a^b b^b (which is positive):\\nLeft side: 8 a^a b^b / (a^b b^b) = 8 a^{a-b}.\\nRight side: 27 a^b b^a / (a^b b^b) = 27 b^{a-b}.\\nSo we get 8 a^{a-b} = 27 b^{a-b}.\\nFactor out the common exponent:\\n( a / b )^{a-b} = 27 / 8.\\nNote 27/8 = (3^3) / (2^3) = (3/2)^3.\\nThus (a/b)^{a-b} = (3/2)^3.\\nWrite a/b in lowest terms. Since a and b are positive integers and we have an exact rational identity, a/b must be a positive rational whose reduced form powers to 27/8. In reduced form, 27/8 = (3/2)^3, where 3 and 2 are coprime.\\nLet a/b = (3/2)^{3 / (a-b)}. For this to be a rational with integer numerator and denominator in lowest terms, (a-b) must divide 3 so that 3/(a-b) is an integer. The positive divisors of 3 are 1 and 3, so:\\nCase 1: a - b = 1.\\nThen (a/b)^1 = 27/8, so a/b = 27/8. This gives a = 27k, b = 8k for some positive integer k, and a - b = 19k. For a - b = 1 we need 19k = 1, impossible in integers. So no solutions here.\\nCase 2: a - b = 3.\\nThen (a/b)^3 = 27/8, so a/b = 3/2.\\nSo we can set a = 3k, b = 2k for some positive integer k and impose a - b = 3:\\na - b = 3k - 2k = k = 3, so k = 3.\\nThus a = 3k = 9, b = 2k = 6.\\nWe should also consider the possibility that b > a (i.e., a - b negative). If a < b, then a - b is negative and (a/b)^{a-b} would be (b/a)^{b-a} inverted, but the right side 27/8 > 1. If a < b, then a/b < 1, and a-b < 0, so (a/b)^{a-b} = (1/(b/a))^{a-b} = (b/a)^{b-a}, with b-a > 0 and b/a > 1, so theoretically this could also produce 27/8. However our reduced-rational argument works symmetrically by swapping roles, but we already captured the positive exponent case by assuming a ≥ b. Any solution with a < b would correspond to swapping labels in a ≥ b scenario; the equation 8 a^a b^b = 27 a^b b^a is symmetric in exchanging a and b if we also exchange 8 and 27, but 8 and 27 are fixed, so asymmetry makes a ≠ b and we just solved the appropriate configuration via exponent manipulation. More concretely, if a < b, then a-b is negative and we get (b/a)^{b-a} = 27/8 with b>a, which is the same structure as before with roles of a and b swapped and exponent positive; that leads back to rational 3/2 and difference 3. When we solve that, we obtain b/a = 3/2, which implies b=3k, a=2k, and b-a=3 => k=3, hence a=6, b=9. But plug into original equation: 8*6^6*9^9 vs 27*6^9*9^6. After factoring, we get 8*9^3 = 27*6^3, i.e., 8*729 = 27*216, 5832 = 5832, so (6,9) also satisfies. Thus both (a,b)=(9,6) and (6,9) are solutions, but they yield the same a^2 + b^2.\\nNow evaluate a^2 + b^2 for the found values a=9, b=6 (or vice versa):\\n9^2 = 81.\\n6^2 = 36.\\nSo a^2 + b^2 = 81 + 36 = 117.\\nTherefore the answer to Problem 2 is 117.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"117\"\n}",
