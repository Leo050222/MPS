In each round, remaining players are paired uniformly at random, and each match is a fair coin flip for who advances.\\nWe want the probability that Ava and Tiffany ever play each other at some point in the tournament.\\n\\nA standard and powerful trick: label AvA and Tiffany, and note that the structure is symmetric. One strategy is to condition on the round in which they might first meet and compute the probability they meet in that round and not earlier. But there is a much simpler symmetry argument:\\n\\nImagine generating the entire random tournament by pairing and coin flips, then looking at the path of opponents Ava faces until she is eliminated (or becomes champion). Every player Ava faces is distinct. Think of it this way: among the 31 other players, Tiffany is a random one. The question “Do Ava and Tiffany ever play?” is equivalent to “Is Tiffany among Ava’s set of opponents created by this random tournament?” Because all players are symmetric and the random pairing/coin-flip process is symmetric, one can show that the number of opponents Ava has is exactly the number of rounds she plays. Let R be the (random) number of rounds Ava plays (including the round she might get eliminated or the finals if she wins the tournament). In that case, Ava’s total distinct opponents equals R. If we condition on R = r, then Ava’s r opponents are a random r-element subset of the 31 other players, all subsets equally likely. Thus, given R = r, the probability that Tiffany is among those opponents is r/31. Hence\\n\\nP(Ava and Tiffany ever meet) = E[r/31] = (1/31) * E[R].\\n\\nSo we just need E[R]. The key is that R is the number of matches Ava plays, which is also the number of times she survives to the next round, with the last one possibly being her elimination unless she wins all 5 rounds.\\n\\nAnother classical way: consider Ava’s chance to still be in the tournament at each round. Initially, she is in the tournament before round 1 with probability 1. After each round, with probability 1/2 she survives, because every match she plays is fair.\\n\\nDefine indicator variables:\\nI1 = 1 (she is in to start round 1),\\nI2 = indicator she reaches round 2,\\nI3 = indicator she reaches round 3,\\nI4 = indicator she reaches round 4,\\nI5 = indicator she reaches round 5,\\nI6 = indicator she reaches round 6 (i.e., wins the tournament).\\n\\nNotice: if she reaches round k, then she plays a match in that round (for k = 1..5), but not in round 6 (there is no match then). The number of matches she plays R is the number of rounds she participates in, which is\\nR = I1 + I2 + I3 + I4 + I5.\\n\\nThe probabilities:\\nP(I1 = 1) = 1,\\nP(I2 = 1) = probability Ava wins round 1 = 1/2,\\nP(I3 = 1) = probability Ava wins two consecutive matches = (1/2)^2 = 1/4,\\nP(I4 = 1) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8,\\nP(I5 = 1) = (1/2)^4 = 1/16,\\nP(I6 = 1) = (1/2)^5 = 1/32 (this confirms the last survival probability, but not needed in R).\\n\\nTherefore\\nE[R] = E[I1] + E[I2] + E[I3] + E[I4] + E[I5]\\n     = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16\\n     = (1 - (1/2)^5) / (1 - 1/2)  (geometric series)\\n     = (1 - 1/32) / (1/2)\\n     = (31/32) * 2\\n     = 31/16.\\n\\nThus\\nP(Ava meets Tiffany) = (1/31) * E[R] = (1/31) * (31/16) = 1/16.\\n\\nSo the probability is a/b = 1/16. Then 100a + b = 100 * 1 + 16 = 116.\\n\\n(We can sanity-check another way: the event that they meet in round k requires that both survive to round k and then be paired together there. The sum over k would give the same 1/16, but the above expectation shortcut is cleaner.)\\n\\nTherefore, Problem 1 answer: 116.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have real p and integer c ≠ 0 such that for all x with 0 < x < 10^{-100}:\\n\\nc - 0.1 < x^p * [ (1 - (1 + x)^{10}) / (1 + (1 + x)^{10}) ] < c + 0.1.\\n\\nAs x → 0^+, the expression must stay within ±0.1 of the fixed integer c (nonzero) for extremely small x. This is essentially forcing the function to be extremely close to a constant c near 0.\\n\\nLet’s analyze the small-x asymptotics. First expand (1 + x)^{10} in a series:\\n(1 + x)^{10} = 1 + 10 x + 45 x^2 + 120 x^3 + 210 x^4 + 252 x^5 + 210 x^6 + 120 x^7 + 45 x^8 + 10 x^9 + x^{10}.\\n\\nThen\\n1 - (1 + x)^{10} = 1 - [1 + 10x + 45x^2 + 120x^3 + ...]\\n                 = -10x - 45x^2 - 120x^3 - 210x^4 - 252x^5 - 210x^6 - 120x^7 - 45x^8 - 10x^9 - x^{10}.\\n\\nAlso\\n1 + (1 + x)^{10} = 1 + [1 + 10x + 45x^2 + ...]\\n                 = 2 + 10x + 45x^2 + 120x^3 + 210x^4 + ....\\n\\nFor very small x, the leading terms dominate. Up to first order in x,\\n1 - (1 + x)^{10} ≈ -10x,\\n1 + (1 + x)^{10} ≈ 2.\\n\\nHence the ratio\\nR(x) = (1 - (1 + x)^{10}) / (1 + (1 + x)^{10})\\nbehaves like\\nR(x) ≈ (-10x) / 2 = -5x\\nfor x very small. More systematically, we can factor x:\\n1 - (1 + x)^{10} = -10x + O(x^2),\\n1 + (1 + x)^{10} = 2 + O(x).\\nThen using standard series for ratio of two analytic functions with nonzero denominator at 0, we get\\nR(x) = (-10x + O(x^2)) / (2 + O(x)) = (-10x)/(2) * [1 + O(x)] = -5x + O(x^2).\\n\\nTherefore the overall expression is\\nF(x) = x^p * R(x) = x^p * [-5x + O(x^2)] = -5 x^{p+1} + O(x^{p+2}).\\n\\nWe want F(x) to stay in (c - 0.1, c + 0.1) for all 0 < x < 10^{-100}. There are a few possibilities depending on p.\\n\\n1) If p + 1 > 0, then as x → 0^+, x^{p+1} → 0, so F(x) → 0.\\n   - Then for sufficiently small x, F(x) will be arbitrarily close to 0. For the inequality to hold for all 0 < x < 10^{-100}, the value c must satisfy |c - 0| ≤ 0.1. But c is a nonzero integer, so |c| ≥ 1, and distance from 0 is at least 1, which cannot be < 0.1. Thus no nonzero integer c works if p + 1 > 0.\\n\\n2) If p + 1 = 0, i.e., p = -1.\\n   Then x^{p+1} = x^0 = 1, so the leading term of F(x) is a nonzero constant:\\n   F(x) = x^{-1} * R(x) ≈ x^{-1} * (-5x) = -5.\\n   More precisely, because R(x) = -5x + O(x^2), then\\n   F(x) = x^{-1} * (-5x + O(x^2)) = -5 + O(x).\\n   So as x → 0^+, F(x) → -5, and for sufficiently small x, F(x) remains extremely close to -5.\\n   Our interval is 0 < x < 10^{-100}, which is overwhelmingly small; the correction term O(x) is at most something on the order of 10^{-100}. Therefore F(x) stays well within, say, -5 ± 10^{-90}, certainly within ±0.1 of -5 for all these x.\\n\\n   Thus the only consistent integer c is c ≈ -5. Since we need accuracy within 0.1 for the entire interval, and F(x) is continuous on (0, 10^{-100}] and converges to -5 as x → 0, the maximum deviation from -5 across that tiny interval is on the order of 10^{-100}, definitely < 0.1. So we can set c = -5 and the inequality holds:\\n   -5 - 0.1 = -5.1 < F(x) < -4.9 = -5 + 0.1.\\n\\n   Therefore (p, c) = (-1, -5) works.\\n\\n   We should also confirm uniqueness: there is no other p giving a nonzero limit.\\n\\n3) If p + 1 < 0, i.e., p < -1.\\n   Then x^{p+1} = x^{negative exponent} blows up as x → 0^+, so F(x) = -5 x^{p+1} + ... diverges to ±∞ (depending on sign). That cannot stay in a fixed finite interval (c - 0.1, c + 0.1) for all sufficiently small x. So p < -1 is impossible.\\n\\nHence the only possible p is -1, and the corresponding integer c must equal the limiting value of F(x), which is -5.\\n\\nConfirm more explicitly by substituting p = -1:\\nF(x) = x^{-1} * [ (1 - (1 + x)^{10}) / (1 + (1 + x)^{10}) ]. For x small and positive, expand:\\n(1 + x)^{10} = 1 + 10x + 45x^2 + 120x^3 + ...,\\n1 - (1 + x)^{10} = -10x -45x^2 -120x^3 - ...,\\n1 + (1 + x)^{10} = 2 +10x +45x^2 +....\\nCompute ratio more precisely to see the constant and first correction:\\n\\n1 - (1 + x)^{10} = -10x -45x^2 + O(x^3),\\n1 + (1 + x)^{10} = 2 +10x +45x^2 + O(x^3).\\n\\nWe can write\\nR(x) = (1 - (1 + x)^{10}) / (1 + (1 + x)^{10}).\\nUse series: write denominator as 2(1 + (10/2)x + (45/2)x^2 + ... ) = 2(1 + 5x + (45/2)x^2 + ...). Then\\n1 / (1 + 5x + (45/2)x^2 + ...) = 1 -5x + (25 - 45/2)x^2 + ... = 1 -5x + (5/2)x^2 + ... (not all coefficients needed exactly, but it shows corrections are O(x)).\\nThen\\nR(x) = [-10x -45x^2 + O(x^3)] * [ 1/(2) * (1 -5x + O(x^2)) ]\\n     = 1/2 * [-10x -45x^2] * [1 -5x + O(x^2)].\\nExpand the leading behavior:\\nFirst multiply -10x by (1 -5x) = -10x +50x^2,\\nadd -45x^2 * 1 = -45x^2.\\nSo inside we get -10x + (50 -45)x^2 + O(x^3) = -10x +5x^2 + O(x^3).\\nNow multiply by 1/2:\\nR(x) = (-5x + (5/2)x^2 + O(x^3)).\\n\\nThen\\nF(x) = x^{-1} R(x) = -5 + (5/2)x + O(x^2).\\nFor 0 < x < 10^{-100}, the deviation from -5 is at most about (5/2)*10^{-100} + O(10^{-200}), which is much less than 0.1, so the inequality with c = -5 indeed holds for all such x.\\n\\nThus the only solution is (p, c) = (-1, -5).\\n\\nTherefore:\\nProblem 1: 116\\nProblem 2: (p, c) = (-1, -5).\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"116\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"(-1, -5)\"\n}",
