Instead of determining the smallest positive shift that preserves the function values modulo the prime for every input, simply find \\( d = \\operatorname{lcm}(23, 22, 10) - 2528 \\).

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are told to compute d = lcm(23, 22, 10) - 2528 instead of the original periodicity problem.\\n\\n1) Compute the least common multiple:\\n- Prime factorize: 23 = 23, 22 = 2 * 11, 10 = 2 * 5.\\n- lcm(23, 22, 10) = 2 * 5 * 11 * 23 = 2530.\\n\\n2) Compute d:\\n- d = 2530 - 2528 = 2.\\n\\nNext, we are given positive integers a and b such that:\\n\\n8 * a^a * b^b = 27 * a^b * b^a.\\n\\nRewrite the equation by dividing both sides by a^b * b^a (which is positive since a, b > 0):\\n\\n8 * a^(a-b) * b^(b-a) = 27.\\n\\nLet t = a - b. Then b - a = -t, so\\n\\n8 * a^t * b^(-t) = 27\\n=> 8 * (a/b)^t = 27\\n=> (a/b)^t = 27/8 = (3^3)/(2^3) = (3/2)^3.\\n\\nThus,\\n(a/b)^t = (3/2)^3.\\n\\nSo we need integer a, b > 0 and integer t = a - b such that (a/b)^t = (3/2)^3. This implies a/b is a rational power of 3/2. The simplest integer solution is obtained by matching bases with exponent 1:\\n\\nTake a/b = 3/2 and t = 3.\\n\\nThen a = 3k, b = 2k for some positive integer k, and a - b = k = t = 3, so k = 3.\\n\\nThus a = 9 and b = 6.\\n\\nCheck the original equation:\\n- Left-hand side: 8 * 9^9 * 6^6.\\n- Right-hand side: 27 * 9^6 * 6^9.\\n\\nCompute the ratio LHS/RHS:\\n(8 * 9^9 * 6^6) / (27 * 9^6 * 6^9)\\n= (8/27) * 9^(9-6) * 6^(6-9)\\n= (8/27) * 9^3 * 6^(-3)\\n= (8/27) * (9/6)^3\\n= (8/27) * (3/2)^3\\n= (8/27) * (27/8)\\n= 1.\\n\\nSo a = 9, b = 6 is a valid positive integer solution.\\n\\nWe now compute a^d + b^2. We found d = 2, so\\n\\na^d + b^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 9^2 + 6^2 = 81 + 36 = 117.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is 117.\",\n    \"answer\": \"117\"\n}",
