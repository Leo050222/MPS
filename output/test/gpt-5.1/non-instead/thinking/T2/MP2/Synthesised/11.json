  "math_problem": "Wendy eats sushi for lunch. She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, labeled as follows:\n\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} A & B & C \\\\ D & E & F \\\\ \\end{array}$\n\nwhere pieces are adjacent if they share a side (not counting diagonally), with adjacencies $A$-$B$, $A$-$D$, $B$-$C$, $B$-$E$, $C$-$F$, $D$-$E$, $E$-$F$. The pieces of sushi are distinguishable. She can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other remaining pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi? Let $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row. Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers randomly (and independently) chosen from the range $[0,1]$. Find the probability that $a$, $b$ and $k$ form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We have a 2x3 grid graph with vertices A,B,C in the top row and D,E,F in the bottom row. Edges: A-B, B-C (top row); D-E, E-F (bottom row); A-D, B-E, C-F (vertical). First, we interpret the definition of k: “after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row” means we remove A and C. The remaining induced subgraph is on {B,D,E,F}. Degrees in this subgraph: B is adjacent to D and E (degree 2), D adjacent to B and E (degree 2), E adjacent to B,D,F (degree 3), and F adjacent only to E (degree 1). Thus deg(F)=1, so k=1. Next, we consider the probability problem: a,b are independent uniform on [0,1], and we consider the side lengths a,b,k with k=1. Triangles with sides (a,b,1) are possible if and only if a,b satisfy the triangle inequalities: 1 < a + b, a < b + 1, and b < a + 1. Since 0 ≤ a,b ≤1, the latter two are automatically satisfied, while 1 < a + b is equivalent to a + b >1. So the valid region in the unit square is {(a,b): 0≤a≤1,0≤b≤1,a+b>1}. This is a right triangle with area 1/2. Within this region, we need to find the subset yielding obtuse triangles. For a triangle with sides (a,b,1), let c=1 be the side opposite the angle between sides a and b. That angle is >90° if 1^2 > a^2 + b^2, i.e., a^2 + b^2 < 1. So an obtuse angle at the vertex joining a and b occurs when (a,b) lies inside the quarter circle a^2 + b^2 < 1 within the unit square. However, the triangle must exist, so we need the intersection of two conditions: a^2 + b^2 < 1 and a + b > 1, with 0≤a,b≤1. Geometrically, this is the region in the unit square that lies both inside the quarter circle of radius 1 centered at the origin and above the line a + b = 1. The area inside the quarter circle in the unit square is one quarter of the area of a unit circle: π/4. The area below the line a + b = 1 inside the quarter circle is the area of a sector minus the area of two right triangles, but an easier way is direct integration or symmetry. Instead, compute the area of the set {0≤a≤1,0≤b≤1,a^2 + b^2<1,a+b>1} by integrating over a from 0 to 1. For each a, b ranges from max(0,1 − a) to sqrt(1 − a^2), provided 1−a < sqrt(1 − a^2). This inequality simplifies to (1−a)^2 < 1 − a^2 → 1 − 2a + a^2 < 1 − a^2 → 2a^2 − 2a <0 → 2a(a−1)<0, which holds for 0<a<1. So for a in (0,1), the lower bound is (1−a) and the upper bound is sqrt(1 − a^2). Thus the area is ∫_0^1 [sqrt(1 − a^2) − (1 − a)] da. Compute the two integrals separately. First: ∫_0^1 sqrt(1 − a^2) da is the area of a quarter circle of radius 1, equal to π/4. Second: ∫_0^1 (1 − a) da = [a − a^2/2]_0^1 = 1 − 1/2 = 1/2. Therefore the area of the region where the triangle exists and is obtuse at the angle between a and b is π/4 − 1/2. We must also consider obtuse angles opposite side a or opposite side b. The angle opposite side a is obtuse if a^2 > b^2 + 1, and opposite b is obtuse if b^2 > a^2 + 1. Since 0≤a,b≤1, we have a^2≤1 and b^2≤1, so a^2 > b^2 +1 or b^2 > a^2 +1 is impossible. Therefore the only obtuse angle possible is the one opposite side 1 (between sides a and b), and our area calculation already counts all obtuse triangles. The total probability is the area of the valid obtuse region divided by the area of the full unit square (which is 1), so the probability is π/4 − 1/2. This depends only on k=1; if k had been another constant, the setup would change, but with our determined k, the final answer is π/4 − 1/2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"pi/4-1/2\"\n}",
