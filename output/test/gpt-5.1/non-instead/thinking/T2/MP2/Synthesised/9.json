  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Instead of determining the number of partitions of the set into pairs that form a single cell, simply find $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game. What is the probability that exactly $k$ games will need to be played to determine a winner?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We have a set A with n ≥ 1 elements. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair, and the pairs form a partition of A. If there is exactly one pair and this partition covers A, then A must have exactly 2 elements: n = 2. The problem then defines k = n + 5, so k = 2 + 5 = 7. Next, we consider a best-of-9 series: the first team to 5 wins takes the series. The Mathletes win each game independently with probability 2/3. We are asked for the probability that exactly k games are needed to determine a winner, i.e., exactly 7 games. For the series to end in exactly 7 games, one of the teams must earn its 5th win on game 7. Since 5 wins are required to clinch the series, after 6 games the leading team must have 4 wins and its opponent must have 2 wins. Then the leading team wins game 7. Compute the probability that the Mathletes win the series in exactly 7 games: we need Mathletes to have exactly 4 wins in the first 6 games, then win game 7. The number of ways to choose which 4 of the first 6 games they win is C(6,4). Probability of any such sequence is (2/3)^4 (1/3)^2 for the first 6 games, times (2/3) for game 7. So P(Mathletes win in exactly 7) = C(6,4) * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2. Similarly, for their opponents (who win with probability 1/3 per game), they must have exactly 4 wins in the first 6 games and win game 7: probability C(6,4) * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2. Therefore, total probability that the series ends in exactly 7 games is the sum: C(6,4) * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2 + C(6,4) * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2. Compute C(6,4) = 15. Then 15 * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2 = 15 * (32/243) * (1/9) = 15 * (32/2187) = 480/2187. Next, 15 * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2 = 15 * (1/243) * (4/9) = 15 * (4/2187) = 60/2187. Adding these: 480/2187 + 60/2187 = 540/2187. Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 27: 540 ÷ 27 = 20, 2187 ÷ 27 = 81. So the probability is 20/81.\",\n    \"answer\": \"20/81\"\n}",
