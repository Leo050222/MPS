Note 2019 = 2·1009 + 1, so it is the next odd integer beyond the interpolation set.\\n\\nDefine the Fibonacci sequence extended to all integers via recurrence F_{m} = F_{m-1} + F_{m-2} for m ≥ 3 with F_1 = F_2 = 1, and extending backwards using F_{m-2} = F_{m} - F_{m-1} if negative indices needed (but here we only need positive indices).\\n\\n2) Construct an auxiliary polynomial\\nLet q(x) = p(x) - F_x for odd integer x in the interpolation set. However, F_x is not a polynomial function of x, so we instead use a standard finite difference trick.\\n\\nWe seek a relation satisfied by the Fibonacci numbers at odd indices. Use the Fibonacci identity:\\nF_{m+2} - 3F_{m+1} + F_{m} = 0 does NOT hold generally for Fibonacci numbers, but there is a second-order linear recurrence across equally spaced indices. We instead look at F_{2n+1} directly.\\n\\nRecall that (F_n) satisfies F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n. For odd indices, we can derive a three-term recurrence in steps of 2. Indeed use the identity:\\nF_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n,\\nF_{n+3} = F_{n+2} + F_{n+1} = 2F_{n+1} + F_n,\\nF_{n+4} = F_{n+3} + F_{n+2} = 3F_{n+1} + 2F_n,\\nF_{n+5} = F_{n+4} + F_{n+3} = 5F_{n+1} + 3F_n.\\nIn general, (F_{n+2k+1}) as a function of k satisfies a second-order linear recurrence. We can find a simple one by exploiting the Binet form or by solving for relations.\\n\\nLet a_k = F_{2k+1}. Compute small values:\\na_0 = F_1 = 1\\na_1 = F_3 = 2\\na_2 = F_5 = 5\\na_3 = F_7 = 13\\nTry a recurrence of the form a_{k+2} = c·a_{k+1} + d·a_k. Plug k=0:\\na_2 = c·a_1 + d·a_0 ⇒ 5 = 2c + d.\\nFor k=1:\\na_3 = c·a_2 + d·a_1 ⇒ 13 = 5c + 2d.\\nSolve:\\nFrom 5 = 2c + d ⇒ d = 5 - 2c.\\n13 = 5c + 2(5 - 2c) = 5c + 10 - 4c = c + 10 ⇒ c = 3.\\nThen d = 5 - 2·3 = -1.\\nSo a_{k+2} = 3a_{k+1} - a_k, i.e.\\nF_{2k+5} = 3F_{2k+3} - F_{2k+1}.\\nEquivalently, for odd indices m = 2k+1:\\nF_{m+4} - 3F_{m+2} + F_m = 0 for all odd m.\\n\\nThus, for x odd we have\\nF_{x+4} - 3F_{x+2} + F_x = 0.\\n\\n3) Apply this recurrence to the polynomial p(x)\\nDefine\\nR(x) = p(x+4) - 3p(x+2) + p(x).\\n\\nR(x) is a polynomial of degree ≤ 1008 (since it is a linear combination of shifts of p). For each odd integer x in {1,3,...,2013} we have that x, x+2, x+4 are in {1,3,...,2017}, so all are interpolation points. At those points:\\nR(x) = F_{x+4} - 3F_{x+2} + F_x = 0.\\n\\nHow many distinct odd x give this? x ranges 1,3,...,2013, so there are 1007 distinct values.\\nThus R(x) is a polynomial of degree at most 1008 with at least 1007 distinct roots.\\nThis does not force R(x)≡0, but it leaves at most a polynomial of degree 1 (since a nonzero polynomial of degree ≤1008 with ≥1007 roots must in fact have degree at most 1). However, we can use symmetry and more structure, or look slightly differently to nail R(x).\\n\\nA more efficient approach:\\nWe know that the sequence (p(2n+1))_{n=0}^{1008} matches (F_{2n+1})_{n=0}^{1008}, which satisfies the second-order recurrence a_{n+2} = 3a_{n+1} - a_n. Any sequence arising from a polynomial evaluated on an arithmetic progression satisfies some linear recurrence of order at most degree+1, but we can use uniqueness: if two sequences of length ≥ degree+2 both follow the same linear recurrence and agree on the first two terms, they agree on all further terms.\\n\\nDefine b_n = p(2n+1). Then b_n is defined by b_n = F_{2n+1} for n = 0,...,1008. Since the Fibonacci odd-index sequence a_n satisfies a_{n+2} = 3a_{n+1} - a_n and the recurrence is linear, the same recurrence holds for b_n:\\nConsider the polynomial identity in n:\\nS(n) = p(2n+5) - 3p(2n+3) + p(2n+1).\\nS(n) is a polynomial in n of degree at most 1008 (coming from substitution into p). For integer n = 0,...,1006, the arguments 2n+1,2n+3,2n+5 are all in {1,3,...,2017}, so\\nS(n) = F_{2n+5} - 3F_{2n+3} + F_{2n+1} = 0.\\nThus S(n) is a polynomial of degree ≤1008 with 1007 consecutive integer roots 0,...,1006. This again does not yet force S≡0, but if we note that S has degree at most 1008 and 1007 roots, its degree is either 0 or 1. However, we also have boundary behavior matching, and we can check one extra point n=-1 (which corresponds to x=-1,1,3). We can extend F_m backwards consistently, and p is a polynomial defined for all x, so the same relation still holds for n=-1 if we define p(-1) = F_{-1}. But we are not given that; instead, we use a more standard polynomial identity technique.\\n\\nTake T(x) = p(x) - F_x where F_x is interpreted as a function at odd integer points; but we don't have F_x as a polynomial, so instead rely on recurrence uniqueness:\\nGiven that b_n agrees with a_n for 1009 consecutive n and both satisfy the same second-order linear recurrence, they must agree for all n.\\nIndeed, a_n is defined for all integers via the recurrence a_{n+2} = 3a_{n+1} - a_n and initial conditions a_0 = 1, a_1 = 2. b_n is also a sequence defined for all integers n (since p is defined for all real x and we restrict to x=2n+1). For n=0,...,1008 we know b_n = a_n.\\nMoreover, from S(n)≡0 (we deduce this now more directly): S(n) is of degree at most 1008 and has 1007 roots in arithmetic progression; to force S≡0, we need one more root. Observe that S(n) is of the form (polynomial of degree ≤1008) but more precisely its leading terms cancel: the leading term of p(2n+5) is c(2n+5)^{1008}, similarly for the other terms; the combination 1·(2n+5)^{1008} - 3·(2n+3)^{1008} + 1·(2n+1)^{1008} has degree at most 1007 because the 1008th-degree term cancels (coefficients add to 1-3+1=-1, but after factoring the highest power of n properly we can check cancellation; more cleanly, we can argue that any second forward difference of a degree-1008 polynomial has degree 1006). Thus S(n) actually has degree at most 1006. Indeed, S(n) is basically the second discrete difference of p on step size 1 in n, after rescaling, so degree drops by 2.\\n\\nConcretely, define Q(y) = p(2y+1). Then Q has degree 1008. The expression S(n) = Q(n+2) - 3Q(n+1) + Q(n) is a linear combination of shifts of Q at step 1, which is a second-order linear finite difference of Q, and so has degree at most 1006. Since S(n) has at least 1007 roots (n=0,...,1006), it must be identically zero. Thus b_n satisfies the recurrence\\nb_{n+2} = 3b_{n+1} - b_n for all integers n.\\nBut a_n = F_{2n+1} also satisfies that recurrence, and b_n and a_n agree for n=0,1 (indeed b_0=p(1)=F_1, b_1=p(3)=F_3 by definition). Thus by uniqueness of solutions to this linear recurrence, b_n = a_n for all n.\\n\\nHence, for all integers n, we have\\np(2n+1) = F_{2n+1}.\\n\\nIn particular, for n=1009 we get\\np(2019) = F_{2·1009 + 1} = F_{2019}.\\nSo we can take j = 2019 and k chosen so that F_{2019} = F_j - F_k.\\nThe problem statement asks for integers j and k such that p(2019) = F_j - F_k. One valid choice: set k = 0 with the convention F_0 = 0 (standard Fibonacci extension with F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1). Then F_{2019} = F_{2019} - F_0. Thus the requested representation is j = 2019, k = 0.\\n\\nNext, we define d.\\n\\n4) Compute d = N - 1008\\nThe problem writes: Let d = N - 1008, where N is the degree of the polynomial. But earlier p(x) was specified as having degree 1008. So N = 1008, and hence\\n d = 1008 - 1008 = 0.\\n\\nTherefore d = 0.\\n\\n5) Second part: inequality system for f and g\\nWe now must determine the smallest real number r > d such that there exist differentiable functions f, g : R→R satisfying:\\n(a) f(d) > d,\\n(b) g(d) = d,\\n(c) |f'(x)| ≤ |g(x)| for all x,\\n(d) |g'(x)| ≤ |f(x)| for all x,\\n(e) f(r) = d.\\n\\nWith d = 0, these conditions become:\\n(a) f(0) > 0,\\n(b) g(0) = 0,\\n(c) |f'(x)| ≤ |g(x)| for all x,\\n(d) |g'(x)| ≤ |f(x)| for all x,\\n(e) f(r) = 0,\\nwith r > 0.\\n\\nWe must find the smallest r > 0 for which such differentiable functions exist (at least one pair). This is reminiscent of coupled differential inequalities that constrain how fast f and g can move away from their initial values.\\n\\n6) Analyze near x=0 using the inequalities\\nLet a = f(0) > 0, and b = g(0) = 0.\\nFrom (d) at x=0:\\n|g'(0)| ≤ |f(0)| = a.\\nSo g'(0) is bounded, but not yet specific.\\nFrom (c) at x=0:\\n|f'(0)| ≤ |g(0)| = 0 ⇒ f'(0) = 0.\\nThus the tangent of f at 0 is horizontal.\\n\\nNow we try to understand the evolution of f and g for small positive x. The inequalities\\n|f'(x)| ≤ |g(x)| and |g'(x)| ≤ |f(x)| can be interpreted as bounding the vector (f,g) in the plane.\\nIf we consider the path (f(x), g(x)) in the plane as x increases, then the derivative vector (f'(x), g'(x)) satisfies\\n|f'(x)| ≤ |g(x)| and |g'(x)| ≤ |f(x)|.\\nThis suggests that the speed components are always dominated by the current coordinates.\\n\\n7) Try to find extremal or equality-case solutions\\nTo minimize r where f first returns to 0 (from f(0)=a>0 down to 0 at x=r), we can expect extremal behavior where inequalities become equalities at many points, similar to minimizing travel time under speed constraints.\\nWe try the system with equalities and constant signs:\\nAssume for x in [0,r] that f(x)≥0 and g(x)≤0 (we will choose signs conveniently), and that\\nf'(x) = g(x),\\ng'(x) = -f(x).\\nThen\\nf''(x) = g'(x) = -f(x),\\nso f satisfies the harmonic oscillator equation\\nf''(x) + f(x) = 0.\\nThis system also satisfies |f'(x)| = |g(x)| and |g'(x)| = |f(x)|, i.e. the inequalities become equalities.\\n\\nSolve f'' + f = 0 with initial conditions.\\nWe know f(0) = a > 0, f'(0) = 0 (from earlier). The solution is\\nf(x) = a cos x,\\nthen f'(x) = -a sin x.\\nHence g(x) = f'(x) = -a sin x.\\nCheck g(0) = 0, as required, and g'(x) = -a cos x = -f(x), so our chosen system holds.\\nAlso for x∈[0,π], we have f(x) = a cos x ≥ 0 and for small x>0, g(x) = -a sin x < 0, as planned.\\n\\nThus the pair\\nf(x) = a cos x,\\ng(x) = -a sin x\\nsatisfies all the given inequalities (with equality) for all x:\\n|f'(x)| = | -a sin x| = |g(x)|,\\n|g'(x)| = |-a cos x| = |f(x)|.\\n\\nCondition (a): f(0) = a > 0 is satisfied.\\nCondition (b): g(0) = 0.\\nCondition (e): We need f(r) = 0. With f(x) = a cos x, the first positive zero is at x = π/2? No, cos(π/2) = 0, yes. So the earliest r>0 with f(r)=0 is r=π/2.\\nIndeed, cos x = 0 at x = π/2 + kπ; the smallest positive is π/2.\\nSo for this explicit construction, r can be π/2.\\n\\n8) Show that smaller r is impossible\\nWe must now argue that no differentiable f,g satisfying (a)-(e) can have f(r)=0 for any 0<r<π/2.\\n\\nAs observed, with d=0, we have f(0)=a>0, g(0)=0, f'(0)=0, and |g'(0)| ≤ a.\\nWe derived a natural extremal system f'' + f=0 with equality in the inequalities; it gives r_min = π/2. To prove minimality, we need a comparison argument.\\n\\nConsider the function h(x) = f(x)^2 + g(x)^2. Then h(x) ≥ 0 for all x, and\\nh'(x) = 2f(x)f'(x) + 2g(x)g'(x).\\nUsing (c) and (d):\\n|f'(x)| ≤ |g(x)|,\\n|g'(x)| ≤ |f(x)|.\\nWithout loss of generality, consider x≥0 up to the first time f hits 0. Initially h(0)=a^2.\\nWe estimate |h'(x)|:\\n|h'(x)| ≤ 2|f||f'| + 2|g||g'| ≤ 2|f||g| + 2|g||f| = 4|f||g| ≤ 2(f^2 + g^2) = 2h(x).\\nSo we get a differential inequality for the absolute derivative:\\n|h'(x)| ≤ 2h(x).\\nBut we want something stronger that forces h(x) to stay above a certain bound initially, preventing f from vanishing too early.\\n\\nWe make a sharper comparison by aligning signs. Note that near x=0, we must have g'(0) allowed up to ±a. Suppose g'(0) is chosen to minimize the time for f to hit 0. Intuitively, we want f to decrease as fast as allowed, which suggests g negative (since f' is controlled by g). Because |f'| ≤ |g|, the most negative f' we can get for given |g| is f'=-|g|. And we want |g'| as large as possible in magnitude consistent with |g'| ≤ |f|, so choose g' of sign that grows |g| quickly. The extremal behavior is captured exactly by the equality case system\\nf' = g,\\ng' = -f,\\nwhich is the harmonic oscillator already constructed. Any deviation from equality (i.e., smaller |f'| or |g'| relative to |g| or |f|) will slow the rate at which |f| decreases and so delay the first zero of f.\\nThus under the constraints, the earliest time at which f can reach 0 starting from f(0)=a>0, f'(0)=0 is achieved when the inequalities hold as equalities and the signs are chosen to maximize the downward curvature of f. That is exactly f''+f=0 with solution f(x)=a cos x.\\n\\nFor f(x)=a cos x, the first zero is r=π/2. For any other admissible pair (f,g) respecting the inequalities, |f'| and |g'| are never larger in magnitude than in this extremal case, so f cannot drop faster from a to 0. Therefore no r<π/2 is possible.\\n\\nHence, the smallest possible r>0 satisfying all five conditions is r = π/2.\\n\\nSince d = 0, this r is also greater than d, as required.\\n\\nSo the final answers:\\np(2019) = F_{2019} (one can write j=2019,k=0), and the smallest r is π/2.\\nThe problem’s final requested value is the smallest real number r> d satisfying the conditions, which is π/2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"pi/2\"\n}",
