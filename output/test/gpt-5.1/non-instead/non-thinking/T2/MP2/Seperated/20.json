  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We want positive integers n such that (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) is a positive integer. Perform polynomial division:\\n\\n(n^3 + 3) ÷ (n^2 + 7) = n + remainder/(n^2 + 7).\\nCompute remainder: n(n^2 + 7) = n^3 + 7n, so n^3 + 3 = n(n^2 + 7) + (3 - 7n). Thus\\n\\n(n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) = n + (3 - 7n)/(n^2 + 7).\\n\\nLet k be that integer value; then\\nk = n + (3 - 7n)/(n^2 + 7).\\nRewriting relation between n and k:\\n(n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) = k ⇒ n^3 + 3 = k(n^2 + 7) ⇒ n^3 - k n^2 - 7k + 3 = 0.\\nWe are asked: instead of listing all n, find a positive integer k such that for each such n, the equality\\nn = (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) + k\\nholds. However, that equation is just n = k + integer_value_of_expression. If the expression itself equals some integer t, then n = t + k. In terms of k, t must satisfy\\nn = t + k\\nand t = (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7).\\nSubstitute n = t + k into t = (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) and solve for consistency where t ∈ Z+, k ∈ Z+. But there is a simpler interpretation that is standard for such problems: we want k such that for every n making the fraction an integer, the value of the fraction is n - k, i.e.\\n(n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) = n - k.\\nEquivalently, the integer value of the expression is always n - k for some fixed positive integer k (independent of n). That matches the wording: \\\"; it equals the value of the expression plus k\\\" — i.e. n = (value of expression) + k, so value = n - k.\\nThus, require\\n(n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) = n - k.\\nCross-multiply:\\nn^3 + 3 = (n - k)(n^2 + 7) = n^3 + 7n - k n^2 - 7k.\\nCancel n^3:\\n3 = 7n - k n^2 - 7k.\\nRearrange:\\nk n^2 + 7k = 7n - 3 ⇒ k(n^2 + 7) = 7n - 3.\\nThen\\nk = (7n - 3)/(n^2 + 7).\\nHere k must be a positive integer and must be the same for all solutions n. First, for a given n, k must be integer, so n^2 + 7 divides 7n - 3. Let d = n^2 + 7. Then\\n7n - 3 ≡ 0 (mod d).\\nBut n^2 ≡ -7 (mod d). The modulus is large compared to 7n - 3; we can bound directly. For n ≥ 4,\\nn^2 + 7 > 7n - 3\\nsince n^2 - 7n + 10 = (n - 5)(n - 2) + 0 ≥ 0 for n ≥ 5, and check n = 4 separately: 4^2 + 7 = 23, 7*4 - 3 = 25, indeed the inequality n^2 + 7 ≥ 7n - 3 holds for all n ≥ 4 and is strict except maybe at small cases we check. For divisibility with positive quotient k, we need 7n - 3 ≥ n^2 + 7. But this fails for n ≥ 4 because n^2 + 7 > 7n - 3, so k would be 0 or less than 1 if it divides at all. So only need to check n = 1,2,3.\\n\\nCheck n = 1:\\nk = (7*1 - 3)/(1^2 + 7) = 4/8 = 1/2, not integer.\\nCheck n = 2:\\nk = (14 - 3)/(4 + 7) = 11/11 = 1, integer.\\nCheck n = 3:\\nk = (21 - 3)/(9 + 7) = 18/16 = 9/8, not integer.\\nThus, the only positive integer n for which there exists a positive integer k satisfying n = (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) + k with k fixed (independent of n) is n = 2; and for that n we obtain k = 1. Moreover, we also check that the original expression is indeed integer there:\\n(n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) = (8 + 3)/(4 + 7) = 11/11 = 1.\\nThis is consistent with n = 2 = 1 (value) + 1 (k). Therefore the required k is 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Find m such that the zeros of 2x^2 - m x - 8 differ by m - 1. Let the roots be r1 and r2. For quadratic ax^2 + bx + c, we have sum and product:\\nr1 + r2 = -b/a,\\nr1 r2 = c/a.\\nHere a = 2, b = -m, c = -8, so\\nr1 + r2 = -(-m)/2 = m/2,\\nr1 r2 = (-8)/2 = -4.\\nThe condition \\\"differ by m - 1\\\" means |r1 - r2| = m - 1. The sign of the difference doesn't matter, so we can say (r1 - r2)^2 = (m - 1)^2.\\nUse the identity\\n(r1 - r2)^2 = (r1 + r2)^2 - 4 r1 r2.\\nCompute in terms of m:\\n(r1 - r2)^2 = (m/2)^2 - 4(-4) = m^2/4 + 16.\\nSet equal to (m - 1)^2:\\n(m^2/4 + 16) = (m - 1)^2.\\nExpand:\\n(m^2/4 + 16) = m^2 - 2m + 1.\\nClear denominators: multiply by 4:\\nm^2 + 64 = 4m^2 - 8m + 4.\\nBring all to one side:\\n0 = 4m^2 - 8m + 4 - m^2 - 64 = 3m^2 - 8m - 60.\\nSo\\n3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0.\\nSolve quadratic:\\nDiscriminant Δ = (-8)^2 - 4*3*(-60) = 64 + 720 = 784 = 28^2.\\nThen\\nm = [8 ± 28]/(2*3) = (8 ± 28)/6.\\nSo the two solutions:\\nm1 = (8 + 28)/6 = 36/6 = 6,\\nm2 = (8 - 28)/6 = -20/6 = -10/3.\\nCheck both quickly.\\nFor m = 6: polynomial is 2x^2 - 6x - 8. Roots: use formula or factor. Solve 2x^2 - 6x - 8 = 0 ⇒ divide by 2: x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 ⇒ (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 ⇒ roots 4 and -1, difference |4 - (-1)| = 5 = m - 1 = 5, works.\\nFor m = -10/3: polynomial is 2x^2 + (10/3)x - 8. Solve using formula: a = 2, b = 10/3, c = -8.\\nRoots r = [-(10/3) ± sqrt((10/3)^2 - 4*2*(-8))]/(2*2).\\nCompute discriminant: (100/9) + 64 = (100/9) + (576/9) = 676/9 ⇒ sqrt = 26/3.\\nThus roots:\\nr1 = [-(10/3) + 26/3]/4 = (16/3)/4 = 4/3,\\nr2 = [-(10/3) - 26/3]/4 = (-36/3)/4 = -12/4 = -3.\\nDifference |4/3 - (-3)| = |4/3 + 9/3| = 13/3. And m - 1 = (-10/3) - 1 = (-10/3) - (3/3) = -13/3, whose absolute value is also 13/3. So indeed the roots differ by m - 1 (up to sign). Therefore the values of m are 6 and -10/3.\\n\\nFinal results: Problem 1: k = 1. Problem 2: m = 6 or m = -10/3.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6,-10/3\"\n}",
