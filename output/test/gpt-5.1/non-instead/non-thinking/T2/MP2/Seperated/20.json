  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe want positive integers n such that (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) is an integer.\\nPerform polynomial division:\\n(n^3 + 3) ÷ (n^2 + 7) = n + (−7n + 3)/(n^2 + 7).\\nSo the expression is an integer exactly when (−7n + 3)/(n^2 + 7) is an integer.\\nLet k be this integer:\\n(−7n + 3)/(n^2 + 7) = k ⇒ −7n + 3 = k(n^2 + 7) ⇒ k n^2 + 7k + 7n − 3 = 0.\\nConsider this as a quadratic in n with integer n and k. Rearranged:\\nk n^2 + 7n + (7k − 3) = 0.\\nFor integer n and k, we can also bound k by size: since n^2 + 7 > 0,\\n|k| = |−7n + 3|/(n^2 + 7) ≤ (7n + 3)/(n^2 + 7).\\nFor n ≥ 1, the fraction (7n + 3)/(n^2 + 7) decreases quickly. Check small n:\\n- n = 1: (7*1 + 3)/(1 + 7) = 10/8 = 1.25\\n- n = 2: (14 + 3)/(4 + 7) = 17/11 ≈ 1.54\\n- n = 3: 24/16 = 1.5\\n- n = 4: 31/23 ≈ 1.35\\n- n = 5: 38/32 = 1.1875\\n- n = 6: 45/43 ≈ 1.0465\\n- n = 7: 52/56 ≈ 0.93 < 1\\nFor n ≥ 7 we have |k| < 1, so k must be 0, but if k = 0 then −7n + 3 = 0 ⇒ n = 3/7, not integer. Hence no solutions for n ≥ 7.\\nSo only n = 1,2,3,4,5,6 need checking directly.\\nCompute (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) for n = 1..6:\\n- n = 1: (1 + 3)/(1 + 7) = 4/8 = 1/2, not integer.\\n- n = 2: (8 + 3)/(4 + 7) = 11/11 = 1, integer.\\n- n = 3: (27 + 3)/(9 + 7) = 30/16 = 15/8, not integer.\\n- n = 4: (64 + 3)/(16 + 7) = 67/23, not integer.\\n- n = 5: (125 + 3)/(25 + 7) = 128/32 = 4, integer.\\n- n = 6: (216 + 3)/(36 + 7) = 219/43, not integer.\\nThus the only positive integers n for which the expression is an integer are n = 2 and n = 5.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe are given quadratic 2x^2 − m x − 8 with roots that differ by m − 1. Let the roots be r1 and r2.\\nFor a quadratic ax^2 + bx + c, sum of roots is −b/a and product is c/a.\\nHere a = 2, b = −m, c = −8.\\nSo r1 + r2 = −b/a = −(−m)/2 = m/2.\\nAlso r1 r2 = c/a = −8/2 = −4.\\nWe are told r1 − r2 = ±(m − 1) in magnitude, but more precisely, the difference between the roots has absolute value |m − 1|. Using the standard formula for the difference:\\n(r1 − r2)^2 = (r1 + r2)^2 − 4 r1 r2.\\nCompute this:\\n(r1 − r2)^2 = (m/2)^2 − 4(−4) = m^2/4 + 16.\\nOn the other hand, since r1 and r2 differ by m − 1 (i.e., |r1 − r2| = |m − 1|), we have\\n(r1 − r2)^2 = (m − 1)^2.\\nEquate the squares:\\n(m − 1)^2 = m^2/4 + 16.\\nExpand and simplify:\\n(m − 1)^2 = m^2 − 2m + 1.\\nSo m^2 − 2m + 1 = m^2/4 + 16.\\nMultiply by 4 to clear denominator:\\n4(m^2 − 2m + 1) = m^2 + 64.\\n4m^2 − 8m + 4 = m^2 + 64.\\nBring all terms to one side:\\n4m^2 − 8m + 4 − m^2 − 64 = 0 ⇒ 3m^2 − 8m − 60 = 0.\\nDivide by common factor 1; there is no common factor of 3 for all coefficients, so leave as is.\\nSolve the quadratic:\\n3m^2 − 8m − 60 = 0.\\nDiscriminant: Δ = (−8)^2 − 4·3·(−60) = 64 + 720 = 784.\\n√Δ = √784 = 28.\\nSo m = [8 ± 28]/(2·3) = [8 ± 28]/6.\\nTwo solutions:\\nm = (8 + 28)/6 = 36/6 = 6.\\nm = (8 − 28)/6 = −20/6 = −10/3.\\nBoth are allowed since the problem does not restrict m to integers.\\nCheck both quickly:\\nFor m = 6: quadratic 2x^2 − 6x − 8 = 0 ⇒ divide by 2: x^2 − 3x − 4 = 0 ⇒ roots 4 and −1, differing by 5. m − 1 = 5, matches.\\nFor m = −10/3: quadratic 2x^2 + (10/3)x − 8 = 0 ⇒ multiply by 3: 6x^2 + 10x − 24 = 0. Discriminant 10^2 − 4·6·(−24) = 100 + 576 = 676 = 26^2, roots real. Roots differ by m − 1 = (−10/3 − 1) = (−13/3). The absolute difference matches what is obtained from the formula, consistent with the squared equality.\\nThus the values of m are 6 and −10/3.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2, 5\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6, -10/3\"\n}",
