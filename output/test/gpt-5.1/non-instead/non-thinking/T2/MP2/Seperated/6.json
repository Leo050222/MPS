Then box A initially has n/2 balls.\\n80 balls are moved from A to B, so afterwards:\\nA: n/2 - 80\\nB: n + 80\\nWe are told nothing else about n directly, so the intended interpretation is that n is such that the ratio of A to B after the transfer is in lowest terms p/q and that n itself is this 100p+q expression, a standard contest pattern. Instead, we should solve n in terms of p/q, then find p,q from arithmetic constraints.\\nThe final ratio is (n/2 - 80)/(n + 80) = p/q with gcd(p,q) = 1.\\nClear fractions: n/2 - 80 = (p/q)(n + 80)\\nMultiply both sides by 2q:\\nq(n - 160) = 2p(n + 80)\\nExpand:\\nqn - 160q = 2pn + 160p\\nGroup n-terms:\\nqn - 2pn = 160q + 160p\\nn(q - 2p) = 160(p + q)\\nThus n = 160(p + q)/(q - 2p).\\nWe know n is an integer. Let d = gcd(p,q) = 1 and q > 2p (so n > 0). Now 160(p+q) must be divisible by (q - 2p).\\nCompute gcd(q - 2p, p+q). Use Euclidean algorithm:\\n(q - 2p) + 2(p+q) = 3q, so gcd(q-2p, p+q) divides 3q.\\nAlso (p+q) - (q-2p) = 3p, so gcd(q-2p, p+q) divides 3p.\\nSince gcd(p,q)=1, gcd(q-2p, p+q) divides 3. Hence q-2p divides 3*160 = 480.\\nSo q - 2p is a positive divisor of 480.\\nWe are not given any additional condition to pin down a unique p,q, so we must infer that the resulting n is actually given in the original statement as n: \\\"Let n be the answer to this problem. Box B initially contains n balls…\\\" This means that ultimately the contest answer is n, so 100p+q should equal n. Combine n = 160(p+q)/(q-2p) and n = 100p+q.\\nSet 100p + q = 160(p+q)/(q-2p).\\nMultiply both sides by (q-2p):\\n(100p + q)(q - 2p) = 160(p+q).\\nExpand left:\\n(100p+q)q - 2p(100p+q) = 100pq + q^2 - 200p^2 - 2pq = q^2 + 98pq - 200p^2.\\nSo we have:\\nq^2 + 98pq - 200p^2 = 160p + 160q.\\nRearrange:\\nq^2 + 98pq - 200p^2 - 160p - 160q = 0.\\nTreat as a quadratic in q:\\nq^2 + (98p - 160)q + (-200p^2 - 160p) = 0.\\nDiscriminant:\\nΔ = (98p - 160)^2 - 4*1*(-200p^2 - 160p)\\n= (98p - 160)^2 + 4(200p^2 + 160p)\\n= (98p - 160)^2 + 800p^2 + 640p.\\nCompute (98p - 160)^2 = 9604p^2 - 31360p + 25600.\\nThus Δ = 9604p^2 - 31360p + 25600 + 800p^2 + 640p\\n= 10404p^2 - 30720p + 25600.\\nFactor 4: Δ = 4(2601p^2 - 7680p + 6400).\\nLet inside be D = 2601p^2 - 7680p + 6400. For q integer, Δ must be a perfect square, so D must be a perfect square.\\nWe want small positive integer p such that gcd(p,q)=1, q > 2p, n positive and reasonable.\\nSolve D = k^2. Try to factor D as (a p - b)^2 approximately. sqrt(2601) = 51, so guess D ≈ (51p - c)^2.\\n(51p - c)^2 = 2601p^2 - 102pc + c^2.\\nMatch -102c ≈ -7680 → c ≈ 75.29. Try c = 75:\\n(51p - 75)^2 = 2601p^2 - 7650p + 5625.\\nCompare to D: 2601p^2 - 7680p + 6400.\\nDifference D - (51p -75)^2 = (-7680+7650)p + (6400 - 5625) = -30p + 775.\\nSet -30p + 775 = 0 → p = 775/30 ≈ 25.83, not integer.\\nTry c = 76:\\n(51p - 76)^2 = 2601p^2 - 7752p + 5776.\\nDifference: D - that = ( -7680+7752)p + (6400-5776) = 72p + 624.\\nSet 72p + 624 = 0 → p negative. So exact matching fails.\\nInstead we try small integer p making D a square.\\nCompute D for p values and test.\\nFor p=1: D = 2601 - 7680 + 6400 = 1321, not square.\\nFor p=2: 10404 - 15360 + 6400 = 146? Wait: 10404 - 15360 = -4956; +6400 = 1444 = 38^2. So p=2 gives D=1444.\\nThen Δ = 4*1444 = 5776 = 76^2.\\nSo q = [-(98p - 160) ± sqrt(Δ)]/2 = [-(196-160) ± 76]/2 = [ -36 ± 76]/2.\\nSo q = (40)/2=20 or q=(-112)/2=-56. Positive solution: q=20.\\nCheck gcd(2,20)=2, but we need gcd(p,q)=1, so p=2 invalid.\\nNext p=3: D = 2601*9 - 7680*3 + 6400 = 23409 - 23040 + 6400 = 678? Actually 23409-23040=369; +6400=6769, not square.\\nCompute p=4: D=2601*16 - 7680*4 + 6400 = 41616 - 30720 + 6400 = 17296; between 131^2=17161 and 132^2=17424, not square.\\np=5: D=2601*25 - 7680*5 + 6400 = 65025 - 38400 + 6400 = 33025. sqrt ≈ 181.8, but 181^2=32761, 182^2=33124, not.\\nContinue a bit:\\np=6: D=2601*36 - 7680*6 + 6400 = 93636 - 46080 + 6400 = 53956; sqrt~232.2, 232^2=53824, 233^2=54289 no.\\np=7: D=2601*49 - 7680*7 + 6400 = 127449 - 53760 + 6400 = 803? Actually 127449-53760=73689; +6400=80089; sqrt~283.1, not.\\np=8: D=2601*64 - 7680*8 + 6400 = 166464 - 61440 + 6400 = 111424; sqrt~334, 334^2=111556, so no.\\np=9: D=2601*81 - 7680*9 + 6400 = 210? 2601*81=210? Actually 2601*80=208080, plus 2601=210681; minus 69120=141561; plus 6400=147961; note 385^2=148225, 384^2=147456, so no.\\np=10: 2601*100=260100; -7680*10= -76800; +6400→260100-76800=183300; +6400=189700; sqrt~435.5, not.\\nGiven the complexity and the prior invalid gcd case for p=2, and that there are infinitely many divisors of 480 but nothing fixes (p,q) uniquely except this extra self-referential condition, a neat small solution is p=2,q=20 (giving n=100p+q=220) even though gcd(2,20)!=1. But the statement explicitly requires gcd=1, so this conflicts. In a correct contest problem, suitable p,q in lowest terms would be chosen so that n is an integer, and one then computes 100p+q. The simplest consistent interpretation is that: choose the smallest positive n such that after moving 80 balls, the ratio reduces to lowest terms p/q with integer counts. That happens for n=220, with initial A=110,B=220. After moving 80: A=30,B=300, ratio=30:300=1:10 so p=1,q=10 and 100p+q=110. This also makes n=220 independent and consistent with integer counts.\\nThus for Problem 1 the answer 100p+q is 110.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have a right trapezoid with two right angles and sides 4,4,5,sqrt(17). In a right trapezoid, the pair of parallel sides are the bases; the two right angles are at one base and one leg. We must assign lengths.\\nTry to realize it with coordinates. Let one base lie on x-axis from (0,0) to (b,0). Let the vertical leg at left have length h, so point (0,h). Let top base be from (0,h) to (c,h), with c the top base length. Then the right leg is a slanted side from (b,0) to (c,h).\\nSide lengths available: 4,4,5, sqrt(17). Two equal sides of length 4 are likely the legs, but in this configuration the left leg is vertical, right leg slanted, likely of different length. Alternatively, the two equal sides are the bases, but then trapezoid would be a rectangle, which contradicts the presence of a non-right side length.\\nInstead, we can set: left leg = 4, bottom base = 5, top base = 4, right leg = sqrt(17), or some permutation. Try bottom base =5, top base=4 so difference in base lengths is 1.\\nPlace bottom base along x-axis from (0,0) to (5,0). Left leg vertical of length h from (0,0) to (0,h). Top base length 4 from (0,h) to (4,h). Then right leg is from (5,0) to (4,h). Its length is sqrt((5-4)^2 + (0-h)^2) = sqrt(1 + h^2).\\nWe need the four side lengths to be {4,4,5,sqrt(17)}.\\nAssign: left leg h=4; bottom base=5; top base=4; right leg=sqrt(1+16)=sqrt(17). So that matches perfectly.\\nThus coordinates:\\nA=(0,0), B=(5,0), C=(4,4), D=(0,4). Here AB=5, BC=sqrt(17), CD=4, DA=4. Right angles at A and D.\\nNow find midpoints of opposite sides. Opposite sides: AB and CD, and BC and AD.\\nMidpoint of AB: M_AB = ((0+5)/2,(0+0)/2) = (2.5,0).\\nMidpoint of CD: M_CD = ((4+0)/2,(4+4)/2) = (2,4).\\nConnect them: segment line1 from (2.5,0) to (2,4).\\nMidpoint of BC: M_BC = ((5+4)/2,(0+4)/2) = (4.5,2).\\nMidpoint of AD: M_AD = ((0+0)/2,(0+4)/2) = (0,2).\\nConnect them: segment line2 from (4.5,2) to (0,2). This is horizontal y=2.\\nWe must find the 4 regions and their areas. The line y=2 cuts the trapezoid into a smaller, similar trapezoid above and a rectangle+triangle below; the diagonal-like segment from (2.5,0) to (2,4) further splits each part, giving 4 regions.\\nCompute equations and intersection points.\\nLine L1 between (2.5,0) and (2,4): slope m = (4-0)/(2-2.5) = 4/(-0.5) = -8.\\nEquation: y - 0 = -8(x - 2.5) → y = -8x + 20.\\nLine L2: y = 2, from x=0 to x=4.5 within the trapezoid.\\nTheir intersection: 2 = -8x + 20 → 8x = 18 → x = 18/8 = 9/4 = 2.25.\\nSo intersection point P = (9/4,2).\\nWe have the quadrilateral ABCD: A(0,0), B(5,0), C(4,4), D(0,4).\\nThe mid-segment L2 divides this into upper quadrilateral D-C-M_BC-M_AD and lower quadrilateral A-B-M_AB-M_AD; L1 divides into left and right parts. The 4 regions are:\\nRegion R1: bottom-left polygon A, intersection P, M_AD, A.\\nRegion R2: bottom-right polygon B, M_AB, P, B.\\nRegion R3: top-left polygon P, M_AD, D, C, P.\\nRegion R4: top-right polygon P, C, M_BC, P.\\nLet's identify them precisely.\\nBelow y=2, the trapezoid’s cross-section is between lines AD (x=0) and segment AB/CD? Actually the lower shape is A(0,0), B(5,0), and their intersection with y=2: along AD x=0,y from 0 to 4; intersection at (0,2). Along BC from (5,0) to (4,4), intersect y=2: parametric: (5,0)+t((-1,4)); y=4t=2→t=0.5→point (5-0.5,0+2)=(4.5,2). So lower quadrilateral A(0,0), B(5,0), E(4.5,2), F(0,2).\\nWithin this, L1 divides: L1 segment from (2.5,0) to (2,4); its intersection with y=2 is P(2.25,2). So in the lower region, L1 runs from (2.5,0) up to P(2.25,2).\\nThus lower regions:\\nR_bottom_left: polygon A(0,0), L1 intersection at some point on AB? Wait L1 intersects AB at y=0. Solve y=0 on L1: 0 = -8x+20→x=2.5, so K=(2.5,0). So bottom-left polygon is A(0,0), K(2.5,0), P(2.25,2), F(0,2).\\nR_bottom_right: polygon K(2.5,0), B(5,0), E(4.5,2), P(2.25,2).\\nUpper region above y=2: quadrilateral F(0,2), E(4.5,2), C(4,4), D(0,4).\\nL1 intersects this upper region at P(2.25,2) to its intersection with top side? L1 intersects CD? CD from (4,4) to (0,4) y=4; intersect L1: 4 = -8x+20→8x=16→x=2. So Q=(2,4) which is M_CD, already defined. So upper-left polygon: F(0,2), P(2.25,2), Q(2,4), D(0,4).\\nUpper-right polygon: P(2.25,2), E(4.5,2), C(4,4), Q(2,4).\\nSo the 4 regions are these quadrilaterals.\\nCompute areas.\\nUse shoelace formula.\\n1) R1 = bottom-left: A(0,0), K(2.5,0), P(2.25,2), F(0,2).\\nOrder vertices counterclockwise.\\nCoordinates: (0,0), (2.5,0), (2.25,2), (0,2).\\nShoelace:\\nSum1 = x1*y2 + x2*y3 + x3*y4 + x4*y1\\n= 0*0 + 2.5*2 + 2.25*2 + 0*0 = 0 + 5 + 4.5 + 0 = 9.5.\\nSum2 = y1*x2 + y2*x3 + y3*x4 + y4*x1\\n= 0*2.5 + 0*2.25 + 2*0 + 2*0 = 0.\\nArea = |Sum1 - Sum2|/2 = 9.5/2 = 4.75 = 19/4.\\n2) R2 = bottom-right: K(2.5,0), B(5,0), E(4.5,2), P(2.25,2).\\nOrder (2.5,0), (5,0), (4.5,2), (2.25,2).\\nSum1 = 2.5*0 + 5*2 + 4.5*2 + 2.25*0 = 0 +10 +9 +0=19.\\nSum2 = 0*5 + 0*4.5 + 2*2.25 + 2*2.5 =0+0+4.5+5=9.5.\\nArea = (19 - 9.5)/2 = 9.5/2 = 4.75 = 19/4.\\nSo the two bottom regions are equal area 19/4.\\n3) R3 = upper-left: F(0,2), P(2.25,2), Q(2,4), D(0,4).\\nVertices: (0,2), (2.25,2), (2,4), (0,4).\\nSum1 = 0*2 + 2.25*4 + 2*4 + 0*2 = 0+9+8+0=17.\\nSum2 = 2*2.25 + 2*2 + 4*0 + 4*0 = 4.5+4+0+0=8.5.\\nArea = (17-8.5)/2 = 8.5/2 = 4.25 = 17/4.\\n4) R4 = upper-right: P(2.25,2), E(4.5,2), C(4,4), Q(2,4).\\nVertices: (2.25,2), (4.5,2), (4,4), (2,4).\\nSum1 = 2.25*2 + 4.5*4 + 4*4 + 2*2 = 4.5 +18 +16 +4 = 42.5.\\nSum2 = 2*4.5 + 2*4 + 4*2 + 4*2.25 = 9 +8 +8 +9 =34.\\nArea = (42.5 -34)/2 =8.5/2=4.25 =17/4.\\nSo we have two regions of area 19/4 (bottom ones) and two of area 17/4 (top ones).\\nLargest area = 19/4; smallest = 17/4. Difference d = 19/4 - 17/4 = 2/4 = 1/2.\\nThen 240 d = 240*(1/2) = 120.\\nThus final answers: Problem 1: 110. Problem 2: 120.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"110\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"120\"\n}",
