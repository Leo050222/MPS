In a standard 2-configuration \\\"of order 1 with exactly 1 cell\\\" built from pairs, the entire set is partitioned into 2-element blocks, which implies n must be even and at least 2 (since n ≥ 1 and we need at least one pair).\\n\\nThe smallest such n is 2. The prompt asks for \\\"k = n + 5, where n is the cardinality of the set A that admits\\\" such a configuration; taking the minimal valid n consistent with the usual interpretation gives n = 2, so k = 2 + 5 = 7.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nA best-of-9 series ends when a team reaches 5 wins. The Mathletes win each game with probability p = 2/3, and their opponent wins with probability q = 1/3. We want the probability that exactly 7 games are needed to determine a winner.\\n\\nExactly 7 games means the series ends on game 7. By that time, one team must get its 5th win.\\n\\nCase 1: Mathletes win in 7 games.\\nThey must have exactly 4 wins in the first 6 games, then win game 7.\\n- Number of sequences of length 6 with exactly 4 Mathlete wins and 2 losses: C(6,4).\\n- Probability of any such sequence: (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^2.\\n- Probability Mathletes then win game 7: (2/3).\\nSo\\nP(Mathletes clinch in 7) = C(6,4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3).\\nCompute:\\nC(6,4) = 15.\\n(2/3)^5 = 32/243.\\n(1/3)^2 = 1/9.\\nSo 15 * (32/243) * (1/9) = 15 * 32 / (243 * 9) = 480 / 2187.\\n\\nCase 2: Opponent wins in 7 games.\\nThey must have exactly 4 wins in the first 6 games, then win game 7.\\n- Number of sequences of length 6 with exactly 4 opponent wins (i.e., 2 Mathlete wins): C(6,4).\\n- Probability of any such sequence: (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^2.\\n- Probability opponent then wins game 7: (1/3).\\nSo\\nP(Opponent clinches in 7) = C(6,4) * (1/3)^4 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3).\\nCompute:\\nC(6,4) = 15.\\n(1/3)^5 = 1/243.\\n(2/3)^2 = 4/9.\\nSo 15 * (1/243) * (4/9) = 60 / 2187.\\n\\nTotal probability that exactly 7 games are played is the sum:\\nP(7 games) = 480/2187 + 60/2187 = 540/2187.\\nSimplify 540/2187:\\nDivide numerator and denominator by 27:\\n540 / 27 = 20, 2187 / 27 = 81, so 540/2187 = 20/81.\\n\\nThus the probability that exactly 7 games are needed is 20/81.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"7\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"20/81\"\n}",
