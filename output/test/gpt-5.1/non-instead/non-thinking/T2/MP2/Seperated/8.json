Distances in the complex plane are absolute differences of complex numbers.\\n\\nProblem 1\\n---------\\nSaturday path:\\nSequence of points: z, z^3, z^5, ..., z^2013. These are odd powers of z from 1 to 2013, i.e. exponents 1,3,5,...,2013. This is an arithmetic sequence of exponents with difference 2.\\nNumber of terms: ((2013 - 1)/2) + 1 = (2012/2) + 1 = 1006 + 1 = 1007 points, so 1006 segments.\\nConsecutive points: z^(2k-1) and z^(2k+1). Their difference in modulus is |z^(2k+1) - z^(2k-1)| = |z^(2k-1)(z^2 - 1)| = |z|^(2k-1) |z^2 - 1| = r^(2k-1) |z^2 - 1|.\\nSum over k from 1 to 1006: Saturday total path length L_S = |z^2 - 1| * sum_{k=1}^{1006} r^(2k-1).\\nThe sum of r^(2k-1) is geometric: sum_{k=1}^{1006} r^(2k-1) = r + r^3 + ... + r^2011.\\nFactor r: = r(1 + r^2 + ... + r^(2*1005)) = r * (1 - r^(2012)) / (1 - r^2), provided r^2 ≠ 1.\\nSo L_S = |z^2 - 1| * r * (1 - r^(2012)) / (1 - r^2).\\n\\nSunday path:\\nSunday starts at 1 and visits z^2, z^4, ..., z^2012.\\nSegments:\\n1 -> z^2: distance |z^2 - 1|.\\nBetween z^(2k) and z^(2k+2): distance |z^(2k+2) - z^(2k)| = |z^(2k)(z^2 - 1)| = r^(2k) |z^2 - 1| for k = 1,...,1005 (since last pair is z^2010 -> z^2012).\\nTotal number of segments: start to z^2 (1 segment) plus 1005 between even powers = 1006 segments, matching Saturday.\\nTotal length: L_Su = |z^2 - 1| * [1 + sum_{k=1}^{1005} r^(2k)].\\nThe sum sum_{k=1}^{1005} r^(2k) = r^2 + r^4 + ... + r^2010 = r^2(1 - r^(2*1005))/(1 - r^2) = r^2(1 - r^2010)/(1 - r^2).\\nThus L_Su = |z^2 - 1| * (1 + r^2(1 - r^2010)/(1 - r^2)).\\nSimplify the bracket:\\n1 + r^2(1 - r^2010)/(1 - r^2) = [ (1 - r^2) + r^2(1 - r^2010) ] / (1 - r^2) = [1 - r^2 + r^2 - r^(2012)] / (1 - r^2) = (1 - r^(2012))/(1 - r^2).\\nSo L_Su = |z^2 - 1| * (1 - r^(2012)) / (1 - r^2).\\n\\nCompare with Saturday:\\nL_S = |z^2 - 1| * r * (1 - r^(2012)) / (1 - r^2),\\nL_Su = |z^2 - 1| * (1 - r^(2012)) / (1 - r^2).\\nThus L_S = r * L_Su.\\nBy the problem, the total distances from starting point to last house are both sqrt(2012):\\nL_S = sqrt(2012) and L_Su = sqrt(2012).\\nSo r * L_Su = L_Su.

Example 123252 is given; we use it to validate our constraints.\\n\\nConstraints step by step:\\n1) d1 d2 divisible by 2 => d2 must be even. Digits allowed are from 1 to 9, so d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8}.\\n2) d1 d2 d3 divisible by 3 => sum of digits d1 + d2 + d3 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\n3) d1 d2 d3 d4 divisible by 4 => last two digits d3 d4 form a number divisible by 4, so 10*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 4.\\n4) d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 divisible by 5 => last digit d5 must be 5 (since digits cannot be 0). So d5 = 5.\\n5) d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 divisible by 6 => number is divisible by both 2 and 3.\\n- Divisible by 2 => d6 is even.\\n- Divisible by 3 => total sum d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\n\\nNote d5 = 5 gives a fixed contribution mod 3: 5 ≡ 2 mod 3.\\nWe want to count all 6-tuples (d1,...,d6) satisfying all digit and divisibility conditions.\\n\\nWe proceed by modular constraints and local parity/last-two-digit conditions.\\n\\nFrom step 3: (d3,d4) must make 10*d3 + d4 divisible by 4. Enumerate possible pairs with digits from 1 to 9.\\nFor a 2-digit number ab to be divisible by 4, the last two digits as number 10*a + b must be in {12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40,44,48,52,56,60,64,68,72,76,80,84,88,92,96}.\\nRestrict to digits 1..9:\\n- 12 -> (1,2)\\n- 16 -> (1,6)\\n- 24 -> (2,4)\\n- 28 -> (2,8)\\n- 32 -> (3,2)\\n- 36 -> (3,6)\\n- 44 -> (4,4)\\n- 48 -> (4,8)\\n- 52 -> (5,2)\\n- 56 -> (5,6)\\n- 64 -> (6,4)\\n- 68 -> (6,8)\\n- 72 -> (7,2)\\n- 76 -> (7,6)\\n- 84 -> (8,4)\\n- 88 -> (8,8)\\n- 92 -> (9,2)\\n- 96 -> (9,6)\\nThis is 18 valid (d3,d4) pairs.\\n\\nNow use the divisibility-by-3 chain:\\nLet S3 = d1 + d2 + d3 (sum of first three digits). Condition for divisibility by 3 of first 3 digits: S3 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\nLet S4 = S3 + d4, and first 4-digit number must be divisible by 4 only, not necessarily by 4 & 3; so no divisibility-by-3 requirement at length 4.\\nLet S5 = S4 + d5 = S4 + 5.\\nThe 5-digit number must be divisible by 5 only; no divisibility by 3 requirement at length 5.\\nFor the full 6-digit number we require divisibility by 3:\\nS6 = S5 + d6 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\nThus S6 = S3 + d4 + 5 + d6.\\nWe know S3 ≡ 0 mod 3. So S6 ≡ d4 + 5 + d6 (mod 3).\\nSince 5 ≡ 2 mod 3, this is equivalent to d4 + d6 + 2 ≡ 0 mod 3, or d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3.\\nSo the divisibility-by-3 condition for the entire number is simply: d4 + d6 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\\nNote this condition does not depend on d1, d2, d3 at all beyond S3 ≡ 0, which we will count separately.\\n\\nNext, divisibility by 2 for the full number gives d6 even.\\nSo d6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}, and among these, we need d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3.\\n\\nApproach: Count combinations by stages.\\n\\nStage A: count valid triples (d1,d2,d3) satisfying:\\n- d1 ∈ {1,...,9}\\n- d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\n- d3 ∈ {1,...,9}\\n- S3 = d1 + d2 + d3 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\nDigits from 1..9 each split evenly among residues 0,1,2 mod 3:\\n- residue 0: {3,6,9}\\n- residue 1: {1,4,7}\\n- residue 2: {2,5,8}.\\nFor d1 and d3, each has 3 options per residue.\\nFor d2, restricted to {2,4,6,8}, we have:\\n2 ≡ 2, 4 ≡ 1, 6 ≡ 0, 8 ≡ 2 (mod 3). So counts: residue 0: {6} (1 option), residue 1: {4} (1), residue 2: {2,8} (2).\\nWe count number of triples with sum ≡ 0 by residue enumeration.\\nLet r1, r2, r3 denote residues of d1, d2, d3. We need r1 + r2 + r3 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\nCounts:\\n- For r1: each residue 0,1,2 has 3 options.\\n- For r3: each residue 0,1,2 has 3 options.\\n- For r2: counts are c2(0)=1, c2(1)=1, c2(2)=2.\\nFor each pair (r1,r3), residue r2 must be (-r1 - r3) mod 3.\\nNumber of choices for (d1,d3) for any (r1,r3) is 3*3=9, since 3 choices for d1 given residue r1, 3 choices for d3 given residue r3.\\nWe can count via residue distribution.\\nAll pairs (r1,r3) and required r2:\\n- (0,0) -> r2=0: ways = 9 * c2(0)=9*1=9\\n- (0,1) -> r2=2: ways = 9 * c2(2)=9*2=18\\n- (0,2) -> r2=1: ways = 9 * c2(1)=9*1=9\\n- (1,0) -> r2=2: 9*2=18\\n- (1,1) -> r2=1: 9*1=9\\n- (1,2) -> r2=0: 9*1=9\\n- (2,0) -> r2=1: 9*1=9\\n- (2,1) -> r2=0: 9*1=9\\n- (2,2) -> r2=2: 9*2=18\\nSum all: 9+18+9+18+9+9+9+9+18 = (9*6) + (18*3) = 54 + 54 = 108.\\nSo there are 108 valid (d1,d2,d3) triples.\\n\\nStage B: count valid (d3,d4) pairs independently from Stage A? We need compatibility between d3 and d4: d3 participates in both S3 and the pair (d3,d4) divisible by 4. However, Stage A counted all possible d3 under the S3 ≡ 0 mod 3 condition without restriction from the pair (d3,d4). We must incorporate both constraints together, so we cannot multiply naive counts; we must refine the counting by residues for each pair (d3,d4) and connect to (d1,d2).\\n\\nBetter approach:\\nWe handle quadruples (d1,d2,d3,d4) simultaneously:\\nConditions:\\n- d1 ∈ {1,...,9}, d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8}, d3 ∈ {1,...,9}, d4 ∈ {1,...,9}.\\n- S3 = d1 + d2 + d3 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\n- (d3,d4) among the 18 allowed pairs making 10*d3 + d4 divisible by 4.\\nWe will consider each valid pair (d3,d4), and count how many (d1,d2) give S3 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\n\\nFor a fixed d3, its residue mod 3 is fixed. Then S3 ≡ d1 + d2 + d3 ≡ 0 => d1 + d2 ≡ -d3 (mod 3).\\nGiven d2 allowed digits, we can count how many d1 values (1..9) satisfy d1 ≡ required residue.\\nFor a given required residue r_d1, there are 3 possible values for d1 (since digits 1..9 have 3 of each residue). So, for each combination of d2 and d3, we just need to see if there is a consistent residue for d1; there always is exactly one residue, giving 3 options for d1.\\nThus, for each pair (d2,d3), there are exactly 3 choices for d1 that make S3 ≡ 0.\\nTherefore, the number of valid triples (d1,d2,d3) equals (# of valid (d2,d3) pairs) * 3.\\nWe can verify this: previously we got total 108 valid triples; thus #valid (d2,d3) pairs = 108 / 3 = 36.\\nNow we need to restrict to those (d2,d3) pairs that are compatible with some valid d4 forming a valid (d3,d4) pair from the 18-list.\\n\\nBut d2 is independent of the (d3,d4) divisibility-by-4 condition. For any fixed valid (d3,d4) pair, d2 can be any of the four allowed even digits {2,4,6,8}. For each (d2,d3) we then have 3 choices for d1.\\nWe must ensure S3 ≡ 0 is satisfiable; but as argued, for each fixed residues d2 and d3, there is always exactly one residue class for d1 giving S3 ≡ 0, and there are 3 digits 1..9 with that residue. So every (d2,d3) combination is valid in the sense that there are 3 possible d1.\\nThus, for each valid (d3,d4) pair, there are:\\n- 4 choices for d2,\\n- for each (d2,d3), 3 choices for d1.\\nHence 12 choices for (d1,d2) per fixed (d3,d4).\\nNumber of valid (d3,d4) pairs is 18, so total number of (d1,d2,d3,d4) quadruples is 18 * 12 = 216.\\nThis matches an alternative: we can recalc from scratch; but it's consistent.\\n\\nStage C: choose d5 and d6.\\nWe already know d5 must be 5 (unique).\\nNow we need d6 even and d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3.\\nOur count from Stage B gave 216 quadruples (d1..d4) with the correct conditions so far.\\nFor each quadruple, we choose d6 satisfying both:\\n- d6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\n- d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3.\\nWe count, for each possible residue class of d4 mod 3, how many choices for d6 exist.\\nCompute residues of even digits:\\n2 ≡ 2, 4 ≡ 1, 6 ≡ 0, 8 ≡ 2 (mod 3).\\nSo d6 choices by residue:\\n- residue 0: {6} (1 option)\\n- residue 1: {4} (1 option)\\n- residue 2: {2,8} (2 options).\\nWe need d4 + d6 ≡ 1 (mod 3), so for each residue r4 of d4, the residue r6 must be 1 - r4 (mod 3).\\nCase r4 = 0 => r6 = 1 => d6 must be residue 1 => only 4, so 1 option.\\nCase r4 = 1 => r6 = 0 => only 6, so 1 option.\\nCase r4 = 2 => r6 = 2 => d6 ∈ {2,8}, so 2 options.\\nSo the number of possible d6 depends on the residue of d4.\\nThus to count all valid full IDs, we need the distribution of d4 residues among the 216 quadruples.\\n\\nWe go back to the 18 valid (d3,d4) pairs and group them by residue of d4.\\nValid pairs (d3,d4):\\n(1,2), (1,6), (2,4), (2,8), (3,2), (3,6), (4,4), (4,8), (5,2), (5,6), (6,4), (6,8), (7,2), (7,6), (8,4), (8,8), (9,2), (9,6).\\nCompute residues mod 3 for d4:\\nDigit residues: 1->1, 2->2, 3->0, 4->1, 5->2, 6->0, 7->1, 8->2, 9->0.\\nGroup by d4:\\n- d4 = 2 (r=2): pairs (1,2), (3,2), (5,2), (7,2), (9,2) => 5 pairs.\\n- d4 = 6 (r=0): pairs (1,6), (3,6), (5,6), (7,6), (9,6) => 5 pairs.\\n- d4 = 4 (r=1): pairs (2,4), (4,4), (6,4), (8,4) => 4 pairs.\\n- d4 = 8 (r=2): pairs (2,8), (4,8), (6,8), (8,8) => 4 pairs.\\nCheck total: 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 18.\\nResidue distribution for d4:\\n- r4 = 0: d4=6 -> 5 pairs.\\n- r4 = 1: d4=4 -> 4 pairs.\\n- r4 = 2: d4=2 or 8 -> 5 + 4 = 9 pairs.\\nBecause for each (d3,d4) pair there are 12 possible (d1,d2) combinations, each pair contributes equally many quadruples. So the number of quadruples with a given d4 residue is (#pairs with that residue)*12.\\nThus:\\n- d4 residue 0: 5 pairs -> 5*12 = 60 quadruples.\\n- d4 residue 1: 4 pairs -> 4*12 = 48 quadruples.\\n- d4 residue 2: 9 pairs -> 9*12 = 108 quadruples.\\nCheck: 60 + 48 + 108 = 216.\\n\\nNow count valid extensions with d6 using the residue-based options per quadruple:\\nFor each quadruple with r4 = 0, there is 1 valid choice for d6.\\nFor r4 = 1, also 1 choice.\\nFor r4 = 2, 2 choices.\\nSo total number of 6-digit IDs:\\nN = 60*1 + 48*1 + 108*2 = 60 + 48 + 216 = 324.\\nTherefore there are 324 possible ID numbers.\\n\\nThus the answers are:\\nProblem 1: k = 0.\\nProblem 2: 324.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"324\"\n}",
