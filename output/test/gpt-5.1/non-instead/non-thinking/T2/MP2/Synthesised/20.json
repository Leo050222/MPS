  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, we find all positive integers n such that (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) is a positive integer.\\n\\n1) Polynomial division:\\n   (n^3 + 3) ÷ (n^2 + 7) = n - (7n - 3)/(n^2 + 7)\\n   So we want (7n - 3)/(n^2 + 7) to be an integer.\\n   Let t = (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7). Then t is integer and\\n   t = n - (7n - 3)/(n^2 + 7).\\n   So n - t = (7n - 3)/(n^2 + 7).\\n   Let d = n^2 + 7. Then d > 0 and d divides 7n - 3.\\n\\n2) Use divisibility: n^2 + 7 | 7n - 3.\\n   Write 7n - 3 = q(n^2 + 7). Then\\n   q n^2 - 7n + 7q + 3 = 0, as a quadratic in n.\\n   For fixed integer q, n must be integer root of\\n   q n^2 - 7n + (7q + 3) = 0.\\n   Discriminant in n: Δ = (-7)^2 - 4q(7q + 3) = 49 - 28q^2 - 12q.\\n   We require Δ ≥ 0 and Δ to be a perfect square.\\n\\n   So k^2 = 49 - 28q^2 - 12q for some integer k.\\n   Rearranged: 28q^2 + 12q + k^2 = 49.\\n   Note 28q^2 grows quickly, so |q| is small.\\n\\n3) Try small integer q:\\n   q = 0: k^2 = 49 -> k = ±7.\\n   q = 1: k^2 = 49 - 28 - 12 = 9 -> k = ±3.\\n   q = -1: k^2 = 49 - 28 + 12 = 33 (not square).\\n   q = 2: k^2 = 49 - 112 - 24 = -87 (no).\\n   Larger |q| give negative values, so only q = 0 or 1 work.\\n\\n   Case q = 0:\\n   Then 7n - 3 = 0*(n^2 + 7) = 0 → n = 3/7, not integer.\\n   So q = 0 yields no integer n.\\n\\n   Case q = 1:\\n   Then 7n - 3 = n^2 + 7 → n^2 - 7n + 10 = 0\\n   → (n - 5)(n - 2) = 0 → n = 2 or n = 5.\\n\\n4) Now compute the integer values of the expression for these n.\\n   For n = 2:\\n   (2^3 + 3)/(2^2 + 7) = 11/11 = 1.\\n   For n = 5:\\n   (5^3 + 3)/(5^2 + 7) = 128/32 = 4.\\n   So the positive integer values are 1 and 4.\\n\\n   The problem states: Let k, where k is the positive integer such that for each such positive integer, it equals the value of the expression plus k.\\n   Interpreting this: we seek a single positive integer k such that for each corresponding n, the given positive integer (call it N) equals (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) + k.\\n   For n = 2, the expression value is 1; for n = 5, it is 4.\\n   There is no single positive k that makes one same fixed N from both 1 and 4, so the only consistent interpretation is that k is that common integer value of the expression itself when considering those n which give the same value.\\n\\n   However, 1 and 4 are distinct, so instead we consider that the problem intends that k is one of the integer values of the expression. Conventionally, we select k as 4 (the larger positive integer value) so that it can be used in the second part (and typical contest formulations usually force a unique k).\\n\\n   Thus we take k = 4.\\n\\n5) Second part: Find all m such that the zeros of 2x^2 - m x - 8 differ by |m - k|.\\n   With k = 4, we need the distance between the roots to equal |m - 4|.\\n\\n   For quadratic 2x^2 - m x - 8 = 0, roots are\\n   x = [m ± sqrt(m^2 + 64)] / 4.\\n   Difference between roots:\\n   Δx = ( [m + sqrt(m^2 + 64)]/4 ) - ( [m - sqrt(m^2 + 64)]/4 )\\n       = (2 sqrt(m^2 + 64))/4 = sqrt(m^2 + 64)/2.\\n\\n   Condition: sqrt(m^2 + 64)/2 = |m - 4|.\\n   Square both sides:\\n   (m^2 + 64)/4 = (m - 4)^2\\n   → m^2 + 64 = 4(m^2 - 8m + 16)\\n   → m^2 + 64 = 4m^2 - 32m + 64\\n   → 0 = 3m^2 - 32m\\n   → m(3m - 32) = 0.\\n   So m = 0 or m = 32/3.\\n\\n   Both values are valid because they make the root difference positive and real:\\n   - m = 0: Δx = sqrt(0 + 64)/2 = 8/2 = 4, and |0 - 4| = 4.\\n   - m = 32/3: m^2 + 64 > 0 so roots are real, and the algebra already enforced equality.\\n\\n   Therefore the values of m are 0 and 32/3.\\n\\n   Final answer: m = 0, 32/3.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0, 32/3\"\n}",
