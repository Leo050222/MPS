  "math_problem": "During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^{2}$. Instead of determining the real part of the square of the starting point, simply find $k = |z| - 1$, where $|z|$ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days. Bob's Rice ID number has six digits, each a number from 1 to 9, and any digit can be used any number of times. The ID number satisfies the following property: the first two digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 2, the first three digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 3, the first four digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 4, the first five digits form a number congruent to $k$ modulo 5, and the ID number itself is congruent to $k$ modulo 6. One ID number that satisfies this condition is 123252. How many different possibilities are there for Bob's ID number?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n  \"reasoning\": \"Let z=re^{iθ}. Saturday path: start at z, then z^3,z^5,...,z^{2013}. Distances are |z^3−z|,|z^5−z^3|,...,|z^{2013}−z^{2011}|. Each term |z^{n+2}−z^n|=|z^n||z^2−1|=r^n|z^2−1|. Indices n are 1,3,5,...,2011 (1006 terms). Total Saturday distance: |z^2−1|(r^1+r^3+...+r^{2011})=√2012. Sunday path: start at 1, then z^2,z^4,...,z^{2012}. Distances: |z^2−1|,|z^4−z^2|,...,|z^{2012}−z^{2010}|=|z^2−1|(1+r^2+...+r^{2010}) (1006 terms). This also equals √2012. Since |z^2−1|>0 (nontrivial movement), we need r+r^3+...+r^{2011}=1+r^2+...+r^{2010}. Subtract: (r−1)+(r^3−r^2)+...+(r^{2011}−r^{2010})=0 ⇒ (r−1)(1+r^2+...+r^{2010})=0. r>0 so r≠1 would force sum 0, impossible since each term positive. Thus r=1. Therefore k=|z|−1=0.\\nNow Bob’s ID conditions: each prefix of length m (2≤m≤6) is ≡k (mod m), and k=0, so each prefix is divisible by m. We need 6-digit sequences of digits 1–9 (0 not allowed) such that: the 2-digit number a1a2 ≡0 mod2, 3-digit a1a2a3 ≡0 mod3, 4-digit a1...a4 ≡0 mod4, 5-digit a1...a5 ≡0 mod5, 6-digit a1...a6 ≡0 mod6. Also digits are 1–9, so the last digit of 5-digit prefix must be 5, so a5=5. From 4-divisibility, the last two digits of first 4 digits form a multiple of 4. Systematic digit search: a2 must be even (for mod2). For mod6 on full 6-digit number: a6 must be even and the sum of all digits ≡0 mod3. Enumerate possibilities:\\n1) Fix a1,a2 so that the 3-digit prefix divisible by 3; then choose a3 even where needed. More direct constructive enumeration works:\\n- Start with 2-digit prefixes divisible by 2 and satisfying future constraints: test a1=1–9, a2 in {2,4,6,8}. For each, pick a3 so that 3-digit number divisible by 3.\\n- Then choose a4 so that 4-digit number divisible by 4 (last two digits multiple of 4) and 3-digit prefix condition still holds (already enforced).\\n- Set a5=5 (only option from mod5 with digits 1–9).\\n- Choose a6 even so that the whole 6-digit number divisible by 6 (i.e., divisible by 2 and 3).\\nWorking this out: valid 2-digit prefixes (a1a2) that can be extended: 12,24,36,48,72,84. For each, find a valid a3 so 3-digit divisible by 3 and allow extension with a4 divisible by 4. Checking systematically:\\n- 12: a3∈{3,9} gives 123,129. For 123, no a4 with 12a3a4 divisible by 4 and future conditions; for 129, a4=6 (since 96 divisible by 4). So we get 1296 as prefix.\\n- 24: a3∈{1,7} gives 241,247; only 247 works, with a4=2 (72 divisible by 4). So we get 2472.\\n- 36: a3∈{3,9} gives 363,369; neither works for 4-divisibility.\\n- 48: a3∈{5} gives 485; but no a4 for 4-divisibility.\\n- 72: a3∈{1,7} gives 721,727; only 721 works with a4=6 (16 divisible by 4). So 7216.\\n- 84: a3∈{3,9} gives 843,849; only 843 works with a4=2 (32 divisible by 4). So 8432.\\nSo prefixes length 4 are 1296,2472,7216,8432. Append a5=5: 12965,24725,72165,84325. Now choose a6 even in {2,4,6,8} so that whole number divisible by 6. Divisible by 2 is automatic from even last digit; we need digit sum ≡0 mod3. Compute sums S of first 5 digits, then S+a6≡0 mod3.\\n- 12965: sum=1+2+9+6+5=23≡2 mod3, so a6≡1 mod3⇒a6 in {4}. So 129654 works.\\n- 24725: sum=2+4+7+2+5=20≡2⇒a6≡1 mod3⇒a6=4. So 247254.\\n- 72165: sum=7+2+1+6+5=21≡0⇒a6≡0 mod3⇒a6 in {6}. So 721656.\\n- 84325: sum=8+4+3+2+5=22≡1⇒a6≡2 mod3⇒a6 in {2,8}. So 843252,843258.\\nAll digits are 1–9; each complete 6-digit number satisfies all modulus conditions. This yields 5 valid IDs: 129654,247254,721656,843252,843258. Therefore, the number of different possibilities is 5.\",\n  \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
