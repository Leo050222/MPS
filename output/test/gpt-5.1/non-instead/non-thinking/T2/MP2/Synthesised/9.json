  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Instead of determining the number of partitions of the set into pairs that form a single cell, simply find $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game. What is the probability that exactly $k$ games will need to be played to determine a winner?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are told a 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell on set A consists of exactly one pair, and pairs form a partition of A. A partition of A into exactly one pair means A has exactly 2 elements (n = 2). So the set A that admits such a configuration has cardinality n = 2. We are asked not to count configurations but instead to compute k = n + 5, so k = 2 + 5 = 7. In the best-of-9 series, the first team to win 5 games wins. The Mathletes have probability p = 2/3 of winning each game (independently). We want the probability that exactly k games are needed, so exactly 7 games are played. This happens only if the winning team reaches its 5th win on game 7. There are two cases: (1) Mathletes win the series in 7; (2) opponents win the series in 7.\\nCase 1: Mathletes win in 7. Then after 6 games, they must have exactly 4 wins, and the opponents 2 wins. The number of such sequences is C(6,4). The probability of any particular such sequence followed by a Mathletes win on game 7 is (2/3)^5 (1/3)^2. So P1 = C(6,4)*(2/3)^5*(1/3)^2.\\nCase 2: Opponents win in 7. After 6 games, opponents must have 4 wins and Mathletes 2 wins. Number of sequences is C(6,4). Probability for any such sequence followed by an opponents win on game 7 is (1/3)^5 (2/3)^2. So P2 = C(6,4)*(1/3)^5*(2/3)^2.\\nCompute: C(6,4) = 15. So\\nP1 = 15 * (2^5 / 3^5) * (1^2 / 3^2) = 15 * 32 / 3^7 = 480 / 2187.\\nP2 = 15 * (1^5 / 3^5) * (2^2 / 3^2) = 15 * 4 / 3^7 = 60 / 2187.\\nTotal probability P = P1 + P2 = (480 + 60) / 2187 = 540 / 2187. Simplify the fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 27: 540 / 27 = 20, 2187 / 27 = 81. So P = 20 / 81. This is the required exact probability that exactly k = 7 games are needed.\",\n    \"answer\": \"20/81\"\n}",
