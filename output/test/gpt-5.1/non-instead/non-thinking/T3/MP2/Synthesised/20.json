  "math_problem": "Find all the pairs $(m, n)$ of integers which satisfy the equation \\[m^5 - n^5 = 16mn.\\] Instead of determining all integer solutions to the Diophantine equation, simply find $k = n - 1$, where $n$ is the positive integer appearing in the solution pair with variables of opposite signs. Suppose $x^{3}-a x^{2}+b x-48$ is a polynomial with three positive roots $p, q$, and $r$ such that $p<q<r$. What is the minimum possible value of $k / p+2 / q+3 / r$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We solve the Diophantine equation m^5 - n^5 = 16mn in integers and look for the solution where m and n have opposite signs and n is positive.\\nRewrite as (m - n)(m^4 + m^3 n + m^2 n^2 + m n^3 + n^4) = 16mn.\\nWe search for small integer solutions. Try n = 1:\\nThen m^5 - 1 = 16m, so m^5 - 16m - 1 = 0.\\nCheck small integer m:\\nm = 1: 1 - 16 - 1 = -16 ≠ 0\\nm = -1: -1 + 16 - 1 = 14 ≠ 0\\nm = 2: 32 - 32 - 1 = -1 ≠ 0\\nm = -2: -32 + 32 - 1 = -1 ≠ 0\\nm = 3: 243 - 48 - 1 = 194 ≠ 0\\nm = -3: -243 + 48 - 1 = -196 ≠ 0.\\nSo no solution with n = 1.\\nTry n = 2: m^5 - 32 = 32m. So m^5 - 32m - 32 = 0.\\nTest integer m:\\nm = 2: 32 - 64 - 32 = -64 ≠ 0\\nm = -2: -32 + 64 - 32 = 0. So (m, n) = (-2, 2) is a solution; signs are opposite and n > 0.\\nCheck for other small n to be sure there isn’t another opposite-sign solution.\\nFor n = 3: m^5 - 243 = 48m => m^5 - 48m - 243 = 0,\\nquick tests show no small integer roots.\\nBy the statement’s wording, we only need the n from the solution pair with opposite signs, which we have as n = 2.\\nThus k = n - 1 = 1.\\nNow for the second part: Suppose x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48 has positive roots p < q < r, and we want the minimum of k/p + 2/q + 3/r. From the first part we have k = 1.\\nUsing Vieta’s formulas for roots p, q, r:\\np + q + r = a,\\npq + pr + qr = b,\\npqr = 48.\\nWe must minimize S = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r subject to p, q, r > 0 and p < q < r and pqr = 48.\\nWe treat this as a continuous optimization problem with constraint pqr = 48.\\nIntroduce variables as positive reals with that product; the ordering p < q < r can be arranged afterward by labeling.\\nSo minimize S = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r given pqr = 48.\\nUse Lagrange multipliers.\\nLet L = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r + λ(pqr - 48).\\nTake partial derivatives and set to zero:\\n∂L/∂p = -1/p^2 + λ q r = 0 => λ q r = 1/p^2.\\n∂L/∂q = -2/q^2 + λ p r = 0 => λ p r = 2/q^2.\\n∂L/∂r = -3/r^2 + λ p q = 0 => λ p q = 3/r^2.\\nDivide pairwise:\\n(λ q r) / (λ p r) = (1/p^2) / (2/q^2) => (q/p) = (q^2 / (2p^2)) => multiply both sides by 2p^2: 2p q = q^2 => for q > 0, 2p = q.\\nSo q = 2p.\\nNext, (λ p r) / (λ p q) = (2/q^2) / (3/r^2) => (r/q) = (2r^2 / (3q^2)) => multiply both sides by 3q^2: 3q r = 2r^2 => for r > 0, 3q = 2r => r = (3/2) q.\\nUsing q = 2p, we get r = (3/2)*2p = 3p.\\nThus at the extremum, (p, q, r) are in ratio 1 : 2 : 3.\\nUse the constraint pqr = 48:\\np * 2p * 3p = 6p^3 = 48 => p^3 = 8 => p = 2.\\nThen q = 4, r = 6, all positive and ordered p < q < r.\\nThese can be roots of such a cubic with some real a, b; the polynomial x^3 - 12x^2 + 44x - 48 corresponds to these roots, and coefficients a = 12, b = 44 are positive, so it’s valid.\\nCompute S:\\nS = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r = 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/6 = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3/2.\\nTherefore the minimum possible value of k/p + 2/q + 3/r is 3/2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3/2\"\n}",
