Because equation is symmetric in exchanging (m, n) up to sign of right side? No, RHS = 16mn is symmetric in m,n; LHS changes sign if we swap? Actually m^5 - n^5 becomes -(n^5 - m^5) so not symmetric.\\nWe need one positive and one negative. Let n > 0, m < 0 (since question specifies n is positive in pair with opposite signs).\\nLet m = -x, x > 0. Then\\n(-x)^5 - n^5 = -x^5 - n^5 = 16(-x)n = -16 x n.\\nMultiply by -1:\\nx^5 + n^5 = 16 x n.\\nNow x, n > 0.\\nWe need positive integers x,n with x^5 + n^5 = 16 x n.\\nLeft grows very fast, so only small possibilities.\\n\\nTry small x and n.\\n- x = 1: 1 + n^5 = 16 n -> n^5 - 16 n + 1 = 0.\\nTest small n:\\n n = 1: 1 - 16 + 1 = -14\\n n = 2: 32 - 32 + 1 = 1\\n n = 3: 243 - 48 + 1 = 196\\n n = 4: 1024 - 64 + 1 = 961\\n n = 0 not allowed (needs positive), and values quickly large positive. No root.\\n\\n- x = 2: 32 + n^5 = 32 n -> n^5 - 32 n + 32 = 0.\\nTest:\\n n = 1: 1 - 32 + 32 = 1\\n n = 2: 32 - 64 + 32 = 0. So n = 2 is a root.\\nHence x = 2, n = 2 is a solution of x^5 + n^5 = 16 x n.\\nThat gives m = -x = -2, n = 2.\\nCheck original equation: m^5 - n^5 = (-2)^5 - 2^5 = -32 - 32 = -64; 16 m n = 16(-2)(2) = -64. Works.\\nSo (m, n) = (-2, 2) is one solution.\\nThen k = n - 1 = 1.\\nWe should confirm this is the intended pair: m and n have opposite signs, with n positive. This pair fits.\\nThere might be other solutions, but we are asked only to find k = n - 1 for that pair, so k = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have polynomial x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48 with positive roots p < q < r.\\nBy Vieta:\\n1) p + q + r = a\\n2) pq + pr + qr = b\\n3) pqr = 48.\\nWe must minimize F = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r.\\nWe have p, q, r > 0, ordered.\\n\\nLet us denote p = 48/(qr). Hard to handle directly with order constraint. Instead, treat p, q, r as positive reals with product fixed 48, then impose ordering later.\\nWe consider F(p,q,r) = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r subject to p,q,r>0 and p q r = 48, with ordering p < q < r.\\nFirst, ignore ordering, minimize over all positive reals with pqr = 48. Then check whether the minimum respects p ≤ q ≤ r, and if not, see boundary.\\n\\nUse Lagrange multipliers.\\nL = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r + λ(p q r - 48).\\nPartial derivatives:\\n∂L/∂p = -1/p^2 + λ q r = 0 -> λ q r = 1/p^2.\\n∂L/∂q = -2/q^2 + λ p r = 0 -> λ p r = 2/q^2.\\n∂L/∂r = -3/r^2 + λ p q = 0 -> λ p q = 3/r^2.\\nDivide equations pairwise.\\nFrom first two: (λ q r)/(λ p r) = (1/p^2)/(2/q^2) -> q/p = (q^2)/(2 p^2) -> multiply both sides by 2p^2: 2 p^2 (q/p) = q^2 -> 2 p q = q^2 -> if q>0, q^2 - 2 p q = 0 -> q(q - 2p) = 0 -> q = 2p (since q>0).\\nFrom second and third: (λ p r)/(λ p q) = (2/q^2)/(3/r^2) -> r/q = (2/q^2)/(3/r^2) = (2 r^2)/(3 q^2).\\nMultiply by 3 q^2: 3 r q^2/q = 2 r^2 -> 3 q r = 2 r^2 -> if r>0, 2 r^2 - 3 q r = 0 -> r(2 r - 3 q) = 0 -> r = (3/2) q.\\nSo at stationary point, q = 2p, r = (3/2)q = 3p.\\nProduct constraint: p q r = p*(2p)*(3p) = 6 p^3 = 48 -> p^3 = 8 -> p = 2.\\nThen q = 4, r = 6; ordering p < q < r holds.\\nCompute F at this point: F = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r = 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/6 = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3/2.\\nWe must check this is global minimum under constraint. F tends to infinity when any variable tends to 0 or ∞ (keeping product fixed forces others to blow up or go to zero). So F has a finite minimum, and the only critical point in interior is (2,4,6), so it is global minimum.\\nOrdering condition is satisfied, so no need for boundary of ordering; the variables already satisfy p < q < r.\\nHence minimum possible value is 3/2.\\n\\nTherefore:\\nProblem 1: k = 1.\\nProblem 2: minimum value is 3/2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
