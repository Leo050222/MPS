Then s = x^3 - 63xy = x(x^2 - 63y).\\nNot every integer pair (x, y) comes from integers (a, b); they must satisfy the quadratic t^2 - xt + y = 0 having integer roots. But instead of parameterizing fully, we search for patterns.\\n\\nObserve special cases:\\n1) If a = b, then x = 2a, y = a^2:\\n   s = 2a(4a^2 - 63a^2) = 2a(-59a^2) = -118a^3, which is negative for positive a and positive for negative a. This does not approach 2012 from below or just above; the values jump in large steps and are far from 2012.\\n\\n2) If a = -b, then x = 0, so s = 0. This is < 2012.\\n\\nWe suspect that we want s just above 2012. Try to factor or complete a form:\\n  s = a^3 + b^3 - 60ab(a + b)\\n    = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b) - 60ab(a + b)\\n    = (a + b)^3 - 63ab(a + b)\\nLet k = a + b. Then s = k^3 - 63k * ab.\\nFor fixed k, s varies in steps of 63k as ab varies over integers achievable by integer roots. We search for small |k| that can put s near 2012.\\n\\nEmpirically local search is efficient. Notice s is cubic in a, b, so the minimum above 2012 shouldn't require huge a, b. We look for small integer solutions numerically in our head by trying a few structured families.\\nA more effective trick: Fix a and treat s as a quadratic in b:\\n  s(b) = b^3 + (a^3 - 60a^2)b - 60ab^2\\nReordering:\\n  s(b) = b^3 -60ab^2 + (a^3 - 60a^2)b\\nWe can instead exploit symmetry by considering b = a + d or small perturbations around simple cases.\\nHowever, a cleaner method is to try to express s as something like (a + b)^3 - 2012 and see if we can make the remainder small. Because 2012 is close to 12^3 = 1728 and 13^3 = 2197, we check sums around 12 and 13.\\n\\nTake k = a + b = 13:\\n  s = 13^3 - 63 * 13 * ab = 2197 - 819ab\\nWe want s >= 2012, minimal. So we want ab as small nonnegative as possible such that 2197 - 819ab >= 2012:\\n  2197 - 819ab >= 2012\\n  185 >= 819ab\\nSince 819ab is nonnegative integer multiple of 819, the only possibility is ab = 0.\\nThus for k = 13, the candidates with s >= 2012 require ab = 0:\\n  s = 2197.\\nCheck if we can get ab = 0 with a + b = 13 and integer a, b: yes, (0, 13) or (13, 0).\\nSo 2197 is achievable.\\n\\nWe must see if there is any s in [2012, 2196]. Try k = 12:\\n  s = 12^3 - 63 * 12 * ab = 1728 - 756ab.\\nFor s >= 2012 with ab >= 0, we need 1728 - 756ab >= 2012, impossible for nonnegative ab. For ab negative, 1728 - 756ab grows larger than 2012 in large jumps (since 756|ab| >= 756). The nearest values above 2012 would be far away; in fact for ab = -1 we get s = 1728 + 756 = 2484 > 2197, so k = 12 yields s >= 2484 whenever s >= 2012.\\n\\nTry k = 14:\\n  s = 14^3 - 63 * 14 * ab = 2744 - 882ab.\\nIf ab >= 1, s <= 1862 (< 2012). For ab <= 0, s >= 2744. So for s >= 2012 and k = 14, we get s >= 2744 > 2197.\\n\\nTry k = 11:\\n  s = 11^3 - 63 * 11 * ab = 1331 - 693ab.\\nFor ab >= 0, s <= 1331, too small. For ab negative, 1331 - 693ab = 1331 + 693|ab|. The smallest >= 2012 is for |ab| = 1, giving s = 2024. This is a candidate: s = 2024.\\nCheck that there exist integers a, b with a + b = 11, ab = -1. The pair (a, b) are roots of t^2 - 11t - 1 = 0, whose discriminant is 121 + 4 = 125, not a perfect square. So there are no integer a, b with sum 11 and product -1. For |ab| = 1, we fail to have integer roots; for other small |ab| near that, values jump by at least 693 and will give s >= 1331 + 693*2 = 2717 > 2197. We conclude k = 11 cannot produce an integer pair giving s in [2012, 2196].\\n\\nSimilarly, for other k we need to see if some combination gives s in [2012, 2196]. But note the step size in s when ab changes by 1 is |63k|, which for |k| >= 11 is at least 693. That is larger than the interval width 2196 - 2012 = 184. For each fixed k, s as a function of integer ab hits an arithmetic progression with difference 63|k|. So at most one value of s per k can lie in that narrow interval. We have checked k = 11, 12, 13, 14 explicitly in terms of existence and value; for |k| >= 15, step sizes are >= 945, making relevant s differences even larger.\\n\\nWe still should check smaller |k|: k = 0, ±1, ±2, ..., 10.\\nWe look at each k:\\n- k = 0: s = 0^3 - 0 = 0.\\n- k = 1: s = 1 - 63ab.\\n  To be >= 2012, 1 - 63ab >= 2012 implies -63ab >= 2011, so ab <= -33. We then get s >= 1 + 63*33 = 2080. So min s >= 2080 for k = 1.\\n- k = -1: s = -1 - 63(-1)ab = -1 + 63ab.\\n  For s >= 2012, 63ab >= 2013, ab >= 33. Then s >= -1 + 63*33 = 2078. So min s >= 2078.\\n- k = 2: s = 8 - 126ab.\\n  For s >= 2012, 8 - 126ab >= 2012 => -126ab >= 2004 => ab <= -15.9..., so ab <= -16. Then s = 8 + 126*16 = 8 + 2016 = 2024 as smallest candidate. But check existence: a + b = 2, ab = -16 gives quadratic t^2 - 2t - 16 = 0, discriminant 4 + 64 = 68, not perfect square; for ab = -17, s jumps to 8 + 126*17 = 2140 > 2197, but that is above our target 2197 anyway. In any case, minimum >= 2024 if achievable, but 2024 already >= 2197? No, 2024 < 2197. However, ab = -16 not integer-root-based, so we need a different ab. Next ab value is -17 giving s = 2140; quadratic t^2 - 2t - 17 has discriminant 4 + 68 = 72, not a square. In fact, none near there give integer roots. More importantly, even if some negative ab gave integer roots, s would be at least 2024, still > 2012 but we must compare against 2197. 2024 < 2197, but we need an actual integer pair. We should check a few explicit pairs with sum 2: (3,-1) gives s = 27 - 1 - 60*3*(-1)*(2) = 26 + 360 = 386 < 2012. (4,-2) gives 64 - 8 - 60*4*(-2)*2 = 56 + 960 = 1016 < 2012. (5,-3) gives 125 - 27 - 60*5*(-3)*2 = 98 + 1800 = 1898 < 2012. (6,-4) gives 216 - 64 - 60*6*(-4)*2 = 152 + 2880 = 3032 > 2012. So for (6,-4), s = 3032, which is > 2197. There is no pair with s in [2012,2196] on this line of examples, and as |a| grows, s grows in larger jumps. So no improvement below 2197.\\n- k = -2: symmetric to k = 2 by swapping (a, b) to (-a, -b). Computation: s = -8 - 63(-2)ab = -8 +126ab. For s >= 2012, 126ab >= 2020 => ab >= ~16.03, so ab >= 17. The smallest candidate is ab = 17 giving s = -8 + 126*17 = -8 + 2142 = 2134. Check a + b = -2, ab = 17 => t^2 + 2t + 17 = 0, discriminant 4 - 68 = -64, no integer solution. Any actual solution will give s > 2134. That yields s >= 2134, again larger than 2197? No, 2134 < 2197, but we do not see integer pairs giving exactly that; explicit search for a few small pairs with sum -2 (e.g. (-3,1), (-4,2), ...) gives s either below 2012 or far above 2197. Thus still no better than 2197.\\n- k = 3: s = 27 - 189ab.\\n  For ab >= 0, s <= 27, too small. For ab < 0, s = 27 + 189|ab|. The smallest >= 2012 is for |ab| = ceil((2012 - 27)/189) = ceil(1985/189) ≈10.5 => 11. So candidate s = 27 + 189*11 = 27 + 2079 = 2106. Check if a + b = 3 and ab = -11 exist: t^2 - 3t - 11 = 0 has discriminant 9 + 44 = 53, not a square. Next |ab| = 12 gives s = 27 + 189*12 = 27 + 2268 = 2295 > 2197. So for k = 3, s >= 2106 and realizable values either below 2012 or above ~2106; none in [2012, 2196] from integer pairs.\\n- k = -3: s = -27 - 63(-3)ab = -27 + 189ab.\\n  For s >= 2012, 189ab >= 2039 => ab >= 10.8..., so ab >= 11. Then s >= -27 + 189*11 = 2052. Check a + b = -3, ab = 11 => t^2 + 3t + 11 = 0, discriminant 9 - 44 = -35, no real. Next ab = 12 gives s = -27 + 2268 = 2241 > 2197. So no better than 2197.\\n- k = 4: s = 64 - 252ab.\\n  For ab <= 0, s >= 64. For ab < 0, s grows as 64 + 252|ab|. The smallest >= 2012: (2012 - 64)/252 ≈ 7.72, so |ab| >= 8. Candidate s = 64 + 252*8 = 64 + 2016 = 2080. Check a + b = 4, ab = -8 => roots of t^2 - 4t - 8, discriminant 16 + 32 = 48, not square. Next |ab| = 9 => s = 64 + 252*9 = 232, sorry 64 + 2268 = 2332 > 2197. So k = 4 yields values >= 2080 with no integer root at that minimal candidate and then jumping above 2197.\\n- k = -4: s = -64 + 252ab.\\n  For s >= 2012, 252ab >= 2076 => ab >= 9; candidate s = -64 + 252*9 = -64 + 2268 = 2204 > 2197.\\n- k = 5: s = 125 - 315ab.\\n  For ab < 0, s = 125 + 315|ab|. The smallest >= 2012: (2012 - 125)/315 ≈ 5.97, so |ab| >= 6. Candidate s = 125 + 315*6 = 125 + 1890 = 2015. This is very close to 2012. Now check existence: a + b = 5, ab = -6 => t^2 - 5t - 6 = 0, discriminant 25 + 24 = 49, which is a perfect square. Roots are (5 ± 7)/2 => 6 and -1. So (a, b) = (6, -1) or (-1, 6) are integer solutions.\\nCompute s for (6, -1):\\n  a^3 + b^3 = 216 + (-1) = 215\\n  a + b = 5\\n  ab = -6\\n  -60ab(a + b) = -60 * (-6) * 5 = 1800\\n  s = 215 + 1800 = 2015.\\nThus s = 2015 is achievable and satisfies s >= 2012.\\nWe also check |ab| = 5 giving s = 125 + 315*5 = 1700 (< 2012) and |ab| = 7 giving s = 125 + 315*7 = 232, sorry 125 + 2205 = 2330 (> 2197), so 2015 is the only candidate near 2012 for k = 5.\\n- k = -5: s = -125 + 315ab.\\n  For s >= 2012, 315ab >= 2137 => ab >= 7; candidate s = -125 + 315*7 = -125 + 2205 = 2080.\\n- k = 6: s = 216 - 378ab.\\n  For ab < 0, s = 216 + 378|ab|. The smallest >= 2012 gives (2012 - 216)/378 ≈ 4.75 => |ab| >= 5.\\n  |ab| = 5 => s = 216 + 1890 = 2106.\\n  Check a + b = 6, ab = -5 => t^2 - 6t - 5 = 0, discriminant 36 + 20 = 56, not a square; so candidate not integer. Next |ab| = 4 => s = 216 + 1512 = 1728 (<2012). So there is no s in [2012, 2196] here.\\n- k = -6: symmetric; minimal s >= 2106.\\n- For |k| between 7 and 10, the step size is at least 63*7 = 441, which exceeds the interval width 2196 - 2012 = 184, so for each such k only one ab can place s in the interval if any. We can check quickly some possibilities as rough bounds:\\n  For k = 7: s = 343 - 441ab.\\n    For ab < 0, s = 343 + 441|ab|. The smallest >= 2012 is |ab| = ceil((2012 - 343)/441) ≈ 3.78 => 4 giving s = 343 + 1764 = 2107.\\n    Check a + b = 7, ab = -4 => t^2 - 7t - 4, discriminant 49 + 16 = 65, not square.\\n    Next |ab| = 3 gives s = 343 + 1323 = 1666 (<2012). So no integer pair gives s in [2012, 2196].\\n  Similar checks for k = 8, 9, 10 give minimal s >= about 2000 but the candidate ab giving the minimal in-range s do not correspond to integer roots (discriminants not perfect squares), while the next feasible ab make s jump above 2197 or far from the interval. Coupled with the already found valid value 2015, inspection shows none drops below 2015 while meeting integer constraints.\\n\\nThus the smallest achievable s subject to s >= 2012 is 2015, attained at (a, b) = (6, -1) or (-1, 6).\\nSo the answer to Problem 1 is 2015.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have cubic p(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 333x - 1001 with roots a, b, c.\\nWe want a^3 + b^3 + c^3.\\nBy Vieta's formulas for x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0 with roots a, b, c:\\n  a + b + c = -p\\n  ab + bc + ca = q\\n  abc = -r\\nHere p = 1, q = -333, r = -1001, so:\\n  a + b + c = -1\\n  ab + bc + ca = -333\\n  abc = 1001\\nWe need a^3 + b^3 + c^3. Use the identity:\\n  a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca).\\nCompute a^2 + b^2 + c^2 in terms of sums:\\n  (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\\n=> a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)\\n= (-1)^2 - 2(-333) = 1 + 666 = 667.\\nThen a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca = 667 - (-333) = 1000.\\nNow apply the identity:\\n  a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c) * 1000 = (-1)*1000 = -1000.\\nSo a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = -1000 + 3abc = -1000 + 3*1001 = -1000 + 3003 = 2003.\\nThus the answer to Problem 2 is 2003.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2015\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"2003\"\n}",
