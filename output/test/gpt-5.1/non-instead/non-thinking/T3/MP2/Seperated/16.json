Define N_5 as those with largest element 5; we only need k = N_5 - 8.\\n\\nIf largest element is 5, S ⊆ {1,2,3,4,5} and must contain 5. Let T = S \\\\ {5} ⊆ {1,2,3,4}. Any subset U of T has sum ≤ 1+2+3+4=10. For a subset of S to sum to 10, either it uses 5 or it doesn’t.\\n- Subsets not using 5 are subsets of {1,2,3,4}; their sums are at most 10, but only those equal to 10 matter. However, among {1,2,3,4}, the only subset with sum 10 is {1,2,3,4}, so T ≠ {1,2,3,4}.\\n- Subsets that use 5 are of the form {5} ∪ U, where U ⊆ T and sum(U)+5=10 ⇒ sum(U)=5. So T must have no subset summing to 5.\\nThus T ⊆ {1,2,3,4}, T ≠ {1,2,3,4}, and T has no subset summing to 5.\\n\\nCheck subsets of {1,2,3,4} with a subset-sum 5:\\n- {1,4} (sum=5)\\n- {2,3} (sum=5)\\n- {1,2,3,4} (contains {1,4} and {2,3})\\nAny superset of {1,4} or {2,3} also has a subset summing to 5, so such T are forbidden. So allowed T are those that do not contain {1,4} or {2,3}, and are not equal to {1,2,3,4}.\\nWe classify by containing 4 or 3:\\n1) T not containing 4: T ⊆ {1,2,3}. Only forbidden condition here is containing {2,3}. Subsets of {1,2,3} are 8 total; those containing {2,3} are {2,3} and {1,2,3}. So allowed: 8 - 2 = 6.\\n2) T containing 4: write T = {4} ∪ T', T' ⊆ {1,2,3}. To avoid containing {1,4}, T must not contain 1 ⇒ T' ⊆ {2,3}. Also to avoid {2,3}, T' ≠ {2,3}. Subsets of {2,3} are ∅, {2}, {3}, {2,3}; remove {2,3} ⇒ 3 allowed T'. So 3 allowed T here.\\nTotal allowed T: 6 + 3 = 9. Each T gives S = T ∪ {5}, so N_5 = 9. Then k = N_5 - 8 = 9 - 8 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe want nonnegative integer (a,b,c) with (ab+1)(bc+1)(ca+1) = 84.\\nFirst restrict possibilities: ab+1, bc+1, ca+1 are positive integers ≥1. Their product is 84 = 2^2 * 3 * 7, so each factor must be a positive divisor of 84.\\nAlso note that if a,b,c are all ≥2, then ab ≥4, bc ≥4, ca ≥4, so each factor ≥5 and product ≥5^3=125>84; impossible. So at least one of a,b,c is ≤1. We split by how many zeros or ones.\\n\\nCase 1: Some variable is 0.\\nSubcase 1a: Exactly one is 0, say a=0, b,c>0.\\nThen ab=0, so ab+1=1; ac=0, so ac+1=1; bc>0 ⇒ bc+1>1. Product becomes 1*(bc+1)*1 = 84 ⇒ bc+1=84 ⇒ bc=83. That would require b,c positive integers with product 83 (a prime). So (b,c) ∈ {(1,83),(83,1)}. Both are allowed since we only assumed >0. So with a=0 we get 2 solutions; by symmetry (zero could be b or c) we get 3·2 = 6 solutions.\\nSubcase 1b: Exactly two variables are 0, say a=0,b=0,c>0.\\nThen ab=0, bc=0, ca=0 ⇒ each factor is 1 ⇒ product = 1≠84. So none.\\nSubcase 1c: All three zero: product =1≠84, none.\\nSo from zeros, we have 6 solutions.\\n\\nCase 2: No variable is 0.\\nThen a,b,c ≥1.\\nSubcase 2a: All three are 1.\\nThen ab+1=2, bc+1=2, ca+1=2 ⇒ product=8≠84. So none.\\nSo at least one variable ≥2. But we already noted they can’t all be ≥2, so exactly one or two among them are 1.\\n\\nSubcase 2b: Exactly two variables equal 1. WLOG a=1,b=1,c≥1.\\nThen ab+1 = 1*1+1 = 2.\\nbc+1 = 1*c+1 = c+1.\\nca+1 = c*1+1 = c+1.\\nProduct: 2(c+1)^2 = 84 ⇒ (c+1)^2 = 42 ⇒ c+1 = √42, not integer. So no solutions.\\n\\nSubcase 2c: Exactly one variable equal 1. WLOG a=1, b,c≥1 and not both 1 (since that’s prior subcase).\\nThen ab+1=1*b+1=b+1.\\nac+1=1*c+1=c+1.\\nbc+1 = bc+1.\\nEquation: (b+1)(c+1)(bc+1) = 84.\\nLet x = b+1 ≥2, y = c+1 ≥2, so b=x-1, c=y-1.\\nThen bc+1 = (x-1)(y-1)+1 = xy - x - y +2.\\nSo x*y*(xy - x - y +2) = 84.\\nNote x,y are positive integers ≥2, and 84 factors are small, so x and y must be among the divisors of 84, but we proceed by direct search via number-theoretic constraints.\\nNote that xy - x - y +2 = (x-1)(y-1)+1.\\nLet z = (x-1)(y-1)+1. Then xyz = 84.\\nBut also (x-1)(y-1) = (x-1)(y-1) = xy - x - y +1. So z-1 equals that value.\\nDirect brute forcing conceptually: x,y ≥2, so xy ≥4; then z = 84/(xy) must be integer ≥1. As xy grows, z shrinks.\\nWe enumerate possible pairs (x,y) where xy divides 84, test whether z computed equals (x-1)(y-1)+1.\\nThe divisors of 84: 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,14,21,28,42,84. xy must be one of these ≥4.\\nWe list each candidate xy and systematically see if there exist integers x,y≥2 with xy equal to that divisor and satisfying z=(x-1)(y-1)+1.\\nInstead of fully listing all factor pairs, we note symmetry in x,y, so we can assume x≤y.\\nWe go through plausible small x:\\n- x=2: then y must make xy divide 84; y can be any divisor of 84/2=42 with y≥2: y∈{2,3,6,7,14,21,42}.\\nFor each, compute z=84/(2y) and z'=(x-1)(y-1)+1=(1)(y-1)+1=y.\\nCondition is z=z' ⇒ 84/(2y)=y ⇒ 42 = y^2 ⇒ y ≈ 6.48, not integer. So no solution for x=2.\\n- x=3: y divides 84/3=28, y∈{2,4,7,14,28}.\\nCompute z=84/(3y) and z'=(2)(y-1)+1=2y-1. Set equal: 84/(3y)=2y-1 ⇒ 84=3y(2y-1)=6y^2-3y ⇒ 6y^2-3y-84=0 ⇒ 2y^2 - y -28=0 ⇒ discriminant Δ=1+224=225=15^2, so y = (1±15)/4 =16/4=4 or -14/4=-3.5. y=4 works.\\nCheck directly: x=3,y=4 ⇒ xy=12, z=84/12=7. Also (x-1)(y-1)+1=2*3+1=7. Works.\\nSo (x,y,z)=(3,4,7) is valid.\\n- x=4: y divides 84/4=21, y∈{3,7,21}.\\nz=84/(4y), z'=(3)(y-1)+1=3y-2 ⇒ 84=4y(3y-2)=12y^2-8y ⇒ 12y^2-8y-84=0 ⇒ divide 4: 3y^2-2y-21=0. Δ=4+252=256=16^2 ⇒ y=(2±16)/6 ⇒ y=3 or y=-14/6.\\nSo y=3 works; check: x=4,y=3 yields same as (3,4) by symmetry (already counted). y=-7/3 invalid.\\n- x=6: y divides 84/6=14, y∈{2,7,14}. z=84/(6y), z'=(5)(y-1)+1=5y-4 ⇒ 84=6y(5y-4)=30y^2-24y ⇒ 30y^2-24y-84=0 ⇒ divide 6: 5y^2-4y-14=0 ⇒ Δ=16+280=296, not a perfect square. So no integer y.\\n- x=7: y divides 84/7=12, y∈{2,3,4,6,12}. z=84/(7y), z'=(6)(y-1)+1=6y-5 ⇒ 84=7y(6y-5)=42y^2-35y ⇒ 42y^2-35y-84=0. Discriminant Δ=35^2+4*42*84=1225+14112=15337, not perfect square.\\nLarger x will only make things worse; also symmetry covers x>y already.\\nThus only solution pair is (x,y)=(3,4) or (4,3).\\nTranslate back: b = x-1, c = y-1. So (b,c) = (2,3) or (3,2). With a=1 this gives two solutions: (a,b,c)=(1,2,3) and (1,3,2).\\nBy symmetry, the variable equal to 1 could be b or c instead of a. So we also get permutations where exactly one of a,b,c is 1 and the other two are 2 and 3. That is all permutations of (1,2,3). There are 3! = 6 such ordered triples.\\n\\nSo in Case 2 (no zeros) we have 6 solutions.\\nTotal solutions combining Case 1 (6) and Case 2 (6) is 12.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: k = 1.\\nProblem 2: number of ordered triples = 12.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
