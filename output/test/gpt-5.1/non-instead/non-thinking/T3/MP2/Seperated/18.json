      "A401": "Trevor and Edward play a game in which they take turns adding or removing beans from a pile. On each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. The player who empties the pile wins. For example, if Trevor goes first with a pile of 5 beans, he can either add 4 to make the total 9, or remove 4 to make the total 1, and either way Edward wins by removing all the beans. There is no limit to how large the pile can grow; it just starts with some finite number of beans in it, say fewer than 1000. Before the game begins, Edward dispatches a spy to find out how many beans will be in the opening pile, call this $n$, then \"graciously\" offers to let Trevor go first. Knowing that the first player is more likely to win, but not knowing $n$, Trevor logically but unwisely accepts, and Edward goes on to win the game. Find a number $n$ less than 1000 that would prompt this scenario, assuming both players are perfect logicians. A correct answer is worth the nearest integer to $\\log _{2}(n-4)$ points. Instead of finding an initial pile size $n$ less than 1000 that is a losing position for the first player under perfect play, simply find $k = s(p) - 6$, where $p$ is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example, and $s(p)$ is the largest perfect square at most $p$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe are told not to solve the full impartial game, but instead to compute a specific derived quantity.\\n\\n1) In the example, the game starts with 5 beans.\\n2) Trevor must add or remove the largest perfect square less than or equal to the current number of beans.\\n3) For 5 beans, the largest perfect square ≤ 5 is 4.\\n4) The problem asks us to define p as the pile size reached by adding this largest perfect square to the initial pile. The initial pile is 5, so:\\n   p = 5 + 4 = 9.\\n5) Then s(p) is defined as the largest perfect square at most p. Since p = 9, s(9) = 9.\\n6) We must find k = s(p) − 6. So:\\n   k = 9 − 6 = 3.\\nThus, the answer to Problem 1 is 3.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe need the number of distinct colorings of the 4 vertices of a tetrahedron using colors {red, blue, green}, under rotational symmetry, with the condition that no face has all three vertices the same color. That condition means: for each triangular face, its three vertices are not all the same color; they may use 2 or 3 distinct colors, but not 1.\\n\\nHowever, the text states: “such that no face has all three vertices the same color.” The phrase “all three vertices the same color” unambiguously means each face is forbidden to have all 3 vertices identical in color. So we must forbid monochromatic faces.\\n\\nA tetrahedron has 4 vertices. We color them with 3 colors, and identify colorings up to rotation. The rotation group of a regular tetrahedron (orientation-preserving symmetries) has 12 elements. We will use Burnside’s Lemma with the rotational symmetry group.\\n\\nGroup structure:\\n- Identity rotation: 1 element.\\n- Rotations by 120° or 240° around an axis through a vertex and the opposite face: 8 elements (4 axes × 2 nontrivial rotations each). These are 3-cycles on the 4 vertices.\\n- Rotations by 180° around an axis through midpoints of opposite edges: 3 elements. These are products of two disjoint transpositions on the 4 vertices.\\nTotal: 1 + 8 + 3 = 12.\\n\\nWe need, for each group element g, the number of colorings fixed by g that also satisfy the constraint: no face is monochromatic (i.e., no face has its 3 vertices all the same color).\\n\\nLabel the tetrahedron’s vertices as 1,2,3,4. A standard set of faces is:\\n- Face A: {1,2,3}\\n- Face B: {1,2,4}\\n- Face C: {1,3,4}\\n- Face D: {2,3,4}\\n\\nWe will classify fixed colorings by type of rotation.\\n\\n1) Identity rotation (1 element):\\n- All 3^4 = 81 vertex colorings are fixed by the identity.\\n- We must subtract those with at least one monochromatic face.\\n\\nCompute number of colorings with no monochromatic face directly.\\nLet the colors be R, G, B.\\nTotal colorings: 3^4 = 81.\\nWe count colorings where at least one face is monochromatic, then subtract from 81.\\n\\nDefine events:\\nE_A: Face A = {1,2,3} monochromatic.\\nE_B: Face B = {1,2,4} monochromatic.\\nE_C: Face C = {1,3,4} monochromatic.\\nE_D: Face D = {2,3,4} monochromatic.\\nWe want |(E_A ∪ E_B ∪ E_C ∪ E_D)^c| = 81 − |E_A ∪ E_B ∪ E_C ∪ E_D|.\\n\\nFirst, compute |E_A|, etc.\\n- For E_A: vertices 1,2,3 have same color; 3 choices for that color; vertex 4 is arbitrary among 3 colors. So |E_A| = 3·3 = 9.\\nBy symmetry, |E_B| = |E_C| = |E_D| = 9.\\n\\nIntersections:\\n- E_A ∩ E_B: Face A (1,2,3) mono, face B (1,2,4) mono.\\n  Let their common color be c. Then 1,2,3,4 all must have color c. So 3 color choices. Thus |E_A ∩ E_B| = 3.\\n  By similar reasoning, any pair of distinct faces intersects in three vertices (if they share an edge) or a vertex; but checking them explicitly yields that if two faces are both monochromatic, all 4 vertices must actually share the same color. In fact, every pair of distinct faces in a tetrahedron shares at least one edge, and requiring both faces’ three vertices to be the same color forces all 4 vertices to be the same color.\\n  Thus for any pair (E_i, E_j), |E_i ∩ E_j| = 3.\\nThere are C(4,2) = 6 pairs, each intersection size 3.\\n\\n- Triple intersections E_i ∩ E_j ∩ E_k: If three faces are monochromatic, again all 4 vertices must have the same color, so 3 colorings. Each triple intersection size is 3.\\nThere are C(4,3) = 4 such triple intersections.\\n\\n- Intersection of all four: E_A ∩ E_B ∩ E_C ∩ E_D: all 4 faces monochromatic, which again means all 4 vertices same color. That gives 3 colorings.\\n\\nSo by inclusion–exclusion:\\n|E_A ∪ E_B ∪ E_C ∪ E_D| =\\n  Σ|E_i| − Σ|E_i ∩ E_j| + Σ|E_i ∩ E_j ∩ E_k| − |E_A ∩ E_B ∩ E_C ∩ E_D|\\n= 4·9 − 6·3 + 4·3 − 3\\n= 36 − 18 + 12 − 3\\n= 27.\\n\\nThus, colorings with no monochromatic face:\\nN_no_mono = 81 − 27 = 54.\\nSo for the identity rotation, the number of fixed colorings that satisfy the condition is 54.\\n\\n2) 120° / 240° rotations about a vertex–face axis (8 elements):\\nTake a specific axis through vertex 1 and the center of face {2,3,4}.\\nSuch a rotation fixes vertex 1 and cycles vertices 2 → 3 → 4 → 2 (a 3-cycle).\\nA vertex coloring is fixed by this rotation iff vertices 2,3,4 all have the same color, say c2, while vertex 1 has some color c1 (possibly equal to c2).\\n- c1: 3 choices\\n- c2: 3 choices\\nSo 3·3 = 9 colorings fixed per such rotation.\\n\\nNow enforce the no-mono-face condition.\\nFaces:\\n- A: {1,2,3}\\n- B: {1,2,4}\\n- C: {1,3,4}\\n- D: {2,3,4}\\nGiven the symmetry of 2,3,4, faces A,B,C each have exactly one vertex from {2,3,4} replaced appropriately, while D is {2,3,4}.\\nWe have:\\n- Vertices 2,3,4 all color c2.\\n- Vertex 1 color c1.\\n\\nCheck monochromatic faces:\\n- Face D is {2,3,4}. All are c2, so face D is always monochromatic.\\nTherefore, any coloring fixed by such a 120°/240° rotation has at least one monochromatic face (face D), so it violates the problem condition.\\n\\nThus the number of allowed colorings fixed by any nontrivial 3-cycle rotation is 0.\\nSo for each of the 8 rotations of this type: 0 fixed allowed colorings.\\n\\n3) 180° rotations about edge-midpoint axes (3 elements):\\nPick an axis through midpoints of edges (1,2) and (3,4). The 180° rotation swaps 1 ↔ 2 and 3 ↔ 4; in permutation notation, (1 2)(3 4).\\nA coloring is fixed iff:\\n- color(1) = color(2),\\n- color(3) = color(4).\\nWe can choose color(1) and color(3) freely from 3 colors each:\\nTotal potential fixed colorings: 3·3 = 9.\\nCall the pair of colors (a,b), where a is the color of vertices 1 and 2, and b is the color of vertices 3 and 4.\\n\\nWe must count how many of these 9 assignments have no monochromatic face.\\nFaces again:\\n- A: {1,2,3}\\n- B: {1,2,4}\\n- C: {1,3,4}\\n- D: {2,3,4}\\n\\nVertex colors:\\n- v1 = a\\n- v2 = a\\n- v3 = b\\n- v4 = b\\n\\nCheck faces:\\n- Face A: {1,2,3} has colors {a,a,b}. This is monochromatic iff a = b and all equal, but already we have two a and one b. For it to be mono, we need a = b, i.e., all three vertices the same color.\\n  Similarly for face B: {1,2,4} = {a,a,b}, mono iff a = b.\\n- Face C: {1,3,4} = {a,b,b}, mono iff a = b.\\n- Face D: {2,3,4} = {a,b,b}, mono iff a = b.\\n\\nThus if a ≠ b, all faces use both a and b, so none is monochromatic.\\nIf a = b, then all vertices are the same color and every face is monochromatic, which is forbidden.\\nSo allowed colorings fixed by this rotation are those with a ≠ b.\\n\\nNumber of ordered pairs (a,b) with a,b ∈ {R,G,B} and a ≠ b: 3 choices for a, then 2 choices for b ≠ a, so 3·2 = 6.\\n\\nHence for each 180° rotation, 6 fixed colorings satisfy the constraint. There are 3 such rotations, so they contribute 3·6 = 18 to the Burnside sum.\\n\\nBurnside’s Lemma:\\nNumber of distinct (up to rotation) allowed colorings = (1/|G|) · Σ_g Fix_allowed(g).\\nWe have:\\n- Identity: 54\\n- Eight 120°/240° rotations: 8 · 0 = 0\\n- Three 180° rotations: 3 · 6 = 18\\nTotal sum of fixed allowed colorings: 54 + 0 + 18 = 72.\\nDivide by 12: 72 / 12 = 6.\\n\\nTherefore, there are 6 distinct colorings of the vertices of a tetrahedron with 3 colors, up to rotation, such that no face has all three vertices the same color.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\n- Problem 1: 3\\n- Problem 2: 6\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
