      "A1054": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $e = N - 86$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nThere are 8 antigens; each student has a distinct subset of these 8, so there are 2^8 = 256 possible subsets, matching the 256 students. For any fixed antigen, among all 256 subsets, exactly half contain that antigen and half do not, by symmetry of subsets. Thus for any given antigen, the number N of students whose blood type includes that antigen is N = 256/2 = 128. The problem asks for e = N - 86, so e = 128 - 86 = 42.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nLet James's integers be a, b, c.\\nAlex's operation: pick two numbers, average them, and add that to the third. The three possible results are:\\nR1 = (b + c)/2 + a,\\nR2 = (a + c)/2 + b,\\nR3 = (a + b)/2 + c.\\nWe are told {R1, R2, R3} = {42, 13, 37}.\\nFirst compute the sum:\\nR1 + R2 + R3 = [(b + c)/2 + a] + [(a + c)/2 + b] + [(a + b)/2 + c].\\nGroup terms: the sum of the averages is [(b + c) + (a + c) + (a + b)]/2 = [2(a + b + c)]/2 = a + b + c.\\nSo R1 + R2 + R3 = (a + b + c) + (a + b + c) = 2(a + b + c).\\nGiven 42 + 13 + 37 = 92, we get 2(a + b + c) = 92, so a + b + c = 46.\\nNow express each R in terms of a + b + c. Example:\\nR1 = a + (b + c)/2 = a + ( (a + b + c) - a )/2 = a + (46 - a)/2 = a + 23 - a/2 = 23 + a/2.\\nSimilarly:\\nR2 = 23 + b/2,\\nR3 = 23 + c/2.\\nThus the multiset {23 + a/2, 23 + b/2, 23 + c/2} is {42, 13, 37}.\\nSubtract 23 from each element of {42, 13, 37}: we get {19, -10, 14}. Hence {a/2, b/2, c/2} = {19, -10, 14}, so {a, b, c} = {38, -20, 28}.\\nCheck:\\n(1) Use a = 38, b = -20, c = 28:\\nR1 = (b + c)/2 + a = (-20 + 28)/2 + 38 = 8/2 + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42.\\nR2 = (a + c)/2 + b = (38 + 28)/2 - 20 = 66/2 - 20 = 33 - 20 = 13.\\nR3 = (a + b)/2 + c = (38 - 20)/2 + 28 = 18/2 + 28 = 9 + 28 = 37.\\nAll match the given possible results, so the three integers (up to order) are 38, -20, and 28.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"42\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"38, -20, 28\"\n}",
