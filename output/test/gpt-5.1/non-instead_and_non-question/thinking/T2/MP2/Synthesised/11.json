  "math_problem": "Wendy eats sushi for lunch. She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, labeled as follows:\n\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} A & B & C \\\\ D & E & F \\\\ \\end{array}$\n\nwhere pieces are adjacent if they share a side (not counting diagonally), with adjacencies $A$-$B$, $A$-$D$, $B$-$C$, $B$-$E$, $C$-$F$, $D$-$E$, $E$-$F$. The pieces of sushi are distinguishable. She can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other remaining pieces. Let $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row. Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers randomly (and independently) chosen from the range $[0,1]$. Find the probability that $a$, $b$ and $k$ form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, interpret the graph and the definition of k.\\n\\nThe sushi pieces are in positions:\\nA B C\\nD E F\\nwith edges: A-B, A-D, B-C, B-E, C-F, D-E, E-F.\\n\\nWe are told: “Let k = deg(F) + 0, where deg(F) is the degree of the bottom-right piece F in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row.” The endpoint pieces of the top row are A and C. So we remove A and C, and then consider the induced subgraph on the remaining vertices B, D, E, F. The degree of F is its number of neighbors in this induced subgraph.\\n\\nOriginally, F is adjacent to C and E. After removing A and C, only C is removed among F’s neighbors, so we keep only the edge F-E. Hence, in the induced subgraph on {B, D, E, F}, F is adjacent only to E. Therefore deg(F) = 1, and k = 1.\\n\\nSo the triangle side lengths we consider are a, b, k with a, b independent uniform on [0,1], and k = 1. Thus the side lengths are a, b, 1. For a, b to form a nondegenerate triangle with side 1, we need the triangle inequalities:\\n1) a + b > 1\\n2) a + 1 > b (always true for a ≥ 0 and b ≤ 1)\\n3) b + 1 > a (always true for b ≥ 0 and a ≤ 1)\\nSo the only constraint for existence is a + b > 1.\\n\\nNow we want the triangle with sides a, b, 1 to be obtuse. A triangle with sides x ≥ y ≥ z is obtuse if and only if x^2 > y^2 + z^2.\\n\\nWe must handle cases depending on the ordering of a, b, 1. But since 1 is the largest possible side (a, b ≤ 1 and 1 is fixed), the largest side is either 1 or, if a = b = 1, still 1 (ties don’t change the logic). Thus the side of length 1 is always a maximal side, and the triangle is obtuse if\\n1^2 > a^2 + b^2, i.e. a^2 + b^2 < 1,\\nprovided the triangle exists (a + b > 1).\\n\\nSo the probability we want is the probability over (a, b) uniformly in the unit square [0,1]^2 that\\n(i) a + b > 1\\nand\\n(ii) a^2 + b^2 < 1.\\n\\nGeometrically, in the unit square:\\n- The region a + b > 1 is the upper-right triangle above the diagonal a + b = 1.\\n- The region a^2 + b^2 < 1 is the quarter-circle of radius 1 centered at (0,0), i.e. the part of the unit disk within the square.\\n\\nWe want the intersection: points in the quarter disk with a + b > 1.\\n\\nCompute the area of this region.\\n\\nIn the first quadrant, the circle is b = sqrt(1 - a^2). The line a + b = 1 is b = 1 - a. They intersect where\\nsqrt(1 - a^2) = 1 - a, with 0 ≤ a ≤ 1.\\nSquare:\\n1 - a^2 = (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a^2\\n⇒ 1 - a^2 = 1 - 2a + a^2\\n⇒ -a^2 = -2a + a^2\\n⇒ 0 = 2a^2 - 2a\\n⇒ 2a(a - 1) = 0\\n⇒ a = 0 or a = 1.\\nAt a = 0, b from the line is 1, from the circle also 1 -> intersection (0,1). At a = 1, b = 0 -> intersection (1,0). On (0,1), circle lies above the line: at a = 1/2, circle gives b = sqrt(3/4) ≈ 0.866, line gives 0.5. Thus inside the quarter disk corresponds to b ≥ 1 - a (above the line) for 0 ≤ a ≤ 1.\\n\\nTherefore, within [0,1]^2, the region with a^2 + b^2 < 1 and a + b > 1 is exactly the portion of the quarter disk above the line a + b = 1. So the area is\\n∫_{a=0}^1 ∫_{b=1-a}^{sqrt(1-a^2)} db da.\\n\\nCompute the inner integral:\\n∫_{1-a}^{sqrt(1-a^2)} db = sqrt(1 - a^2) - (1 - a).\\nSo the area A is\\nA = ∫_0^1 [sqrt(1 - a^2) - (1 - a)] da\\n  = ∫_0^1 sqrt(1 - a^2) da - ∫_0^1 (1 - a) da.\\n\\nThe first integral is the area of a quarter unit circle:\\n∫_0^1 sqrt(1 - a^2) da = π/4.\\n\\nThe second integral:\\n∫_0^1 (1 - a) da = [a - a^2/2]_0^1 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\\n\\nHence the desired area, which equals the probability for uniform (a,b), is\\nA = π/4 - 1/2.\\n\\nThus the probability that a, b, and k (with k = 1) form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle is π/4 - 1/2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"pi/4-1/2\"\n}",
