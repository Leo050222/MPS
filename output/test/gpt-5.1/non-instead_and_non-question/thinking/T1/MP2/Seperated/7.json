So assume the four regions of x degrees each are shaded, and the 20° and 140° regions are unshaded.\\nTotal shaded angle = 4x = 4 × 50 = 200 degrees.\\nTotal circle angle = 360 degrees.\\nProbability spinner lands on a shaded region = 200 / 360 = 5 / 9.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have a pair (205800, 35k) called a happy pair if gcd(205800, 35k) is a perfect square. We need the number of positive integers k ≤ 2940 that satisfy this.\\nFirst factor 205800 and 35.\\nFactor 35: 35 = 5 × 7.\\nFactor 205800:\\n205800 = 2058 × 100.\\n100 = 2^2 × 5^2.\\nFactor 2058: 2058 = 2 × 1029.\\nFactor 1029: 1029 = 3 × 343.\\n343 = 7^3.\\nSo 1029 = 3 × 7^3.\\nThen 2058 = 2 × 3 × 7^3.\\nTherefore 205800 = (2 × 3 × 7^3) × (2^2 × 5^2) = 2^3 × 3^1 × 5^2 × 7^3.\\nSo:\\n- 205800 = 2^3 × 3^1 × 5^2 × 7^3\\n- 35 = 5^1 × 7^1\\nLet prime factorization of k be: k = 2^a × 3^b × 5^c × 7^d × (other primes)^.... Only primes 2,3,5,7 may affect gcd with 205800, since 205800 has only those primes. Any other primes in k do not enter gcd.\\nThen 35k = 5^{1+c} × 7^{1+d} × 2^a × 3^b × (other primes). For gcd with 205800, prime exponents are:\\n- For p = 2: exponent in gcd is min(3, a).\\n- For p = 3: exponent in gcd is min(1, b).\\n- For p = 5: exponent in gcd is min(2, 1+c).\\n- For p = 7: exponent in gcd is min(3, 1+d).\\nFor gcd to be a perfect square, all these exponents must be even integers (0, 2, ...). Also, gcd includes only primes 2,3,5,7, so we just need these exponents even.\\nAnalyze each prime separately.\\n\\nPrime 2:\\nExponent e2 = min(3, a) must be even.\\nPossible values of a:\\n- If a = 0 → min(3, 0) = 0 (even) → allowed.\\n- If a = 1 → 1 (odd) → not allowed.\\n- If a = 2 → 2 (even) → allowed.\\n- If a ≥ 3 → min(3, a) = 3 (odd) → not allowed.\\nTherefore allowed 2-exponent values in k: a ∈ {0, 2}. So k is divisible by 4 or by 1 with respect to 2, but not by 2 alone and not by 8 or higher power of 2.\\n\\nPrime 3:\\nExponent e3 = min(1, b) must be even.\\nPossibilities:\\n- If b = 0 → e3 = 0 (even) → allowed.\\n- If b ≥ 1 → e3 = 1 (odd) → not allowed.\\nSo k cannot be divisible by 3. Hence gcd with 3 is 0 exponent.\\n\\nPrime 5:\\nExponent e5 = min(2, 1+c) must be even.\\nConsider c, exponent of 5 in k:\\n- If c = 0 → 1+c = 1 → min(2,1) = 1 (odd) → not allowed.\\n- If c = 1 → 1+c = 2 → min(2,2) = 2 (even) → allowed.\\n- If c ≥ 2 → 1+c ≥ 3 → min(2,1+c) = 2 (even) → allowed.\\nSo we need c ≥ 1; i.e., k must be divisible by 5.\\n\\nPrime 7:\\nExponent e7 = min(3, 1+d) must be even.\\nConsider d, exponent of 7 in k:\\n- d = 0 → 1+d = 1 → min(3,1) = 1 (odd) → not allowed.\\n- d = 1 → 1+d = 2 → min(3,2) = 2 (even) → allowed.\\n- d = 2 → 1+d = 3 → min(3,3) = 3 (odd) → not allowed.\\n- d ≥ 3 → 1+d ≥ 4 → min(3,1+d) = 3 (odd) → not allowed.\\nSo we must have d = 1; i.e., k has exactly one factor of 7 (divisible by 7 but not by 49).\\n\\nAny other primes in k:\\nThey do not appear in 205800, so their exponent in the gcd is 0, which is even. So there is no restriction on primes other than 2, 3, 5, 7.\\nThus the necessary and sufficient conditions for k:\\n- 2-adic: a ∈ {0, 2} (i.e., k is either not divisible by 2, or divisible by 4 but not by 8)\\n- 3-adic: k not divisible by 3\\n- 5-adic: k divisible by 5\\n- 7-adic: k divisible by 7 but not by 49\\n- No restrictions on primes ≥ 11\\n\\nWe must count all positive integers k ≤ 2940 satisfying these conditions.\\nRewrite k in terms of these constraints.\\nBecause k must be divisible by 5 and 7, it must be divisible by 35. Also, it must not be divisible by 3, and cannot be divisible by 49. Also, the 2-adic condition says that the exponent of 2 in k is 0 or 2.\\nSo factor k as k = 35 × m, with m a positive integer.\\nSince 35 = 5 × 7, we already account for c ≥ 1 and d ≥ 1. The condition that k is divisible by 7 but not 49 translates to: in k, exponent of 7 is exactly 1. But 35 has one factor of 7. So m must not introduce any further factor of 7. Hence gcd(m, 7) = 1.\\nSimilarly, 35 has 5^1, so k is divisible by at least 5; there is no upper bound on exponent of 5, so m may or may not include 5, no restriction from 5 beyond divisibility that is already satisfied.\\nThe condition that k is not divisible by 3 means m is not divisible by 3 (since 35 has no factor of 3). So gcd(m, 3) = 1.\\nFor the 2-adic condition, we track exponent of 2 in k.\\nLet the exponent of 2 in m be a; since 35 has no factor of 2, the exponent in k is also a.\\nWe need a ∈ {0, 2}, so either m is odd (a = 0) or m is divisible by 4 but not 8 (a = 2). So m’s 2-adic valuation is 0 or 2.\\nAll other primes are unrestricted (except for 3 and 7 restrictions already stated). So m is any positive integer ≤ 2940/35 with:\\n- ν2(m) ∈ {0, 2}\\n- 3 ∤ m\\n- 7 ∤ m\\n\\nNow find the range for m:\\nSince k = 35m and k ≤ 2940:\\n35m ≤ 2940 → m ≤ 2940 / 35.\\nCompute 2940 / 35:\\n2940 ÷ 5 = 588, then ÷7 = 84. So m ≤ 84.\\nThus we need to count integers m between 1 and 84 satisfying:\\n1) 3 ∤ m\\n2) 7 ∤ m\\n3) ν2(m) ∈ {0, 2} (i.e., m odd or divisible by 4 but not by 8).\\n\\nCount by splitting on ν2(m).\\nLet the set of allowed m be union of:\\n- S1: m odd, 1 ≤ m ≤ 84, 3 ∤ m, 7 ∤ m.\\n- S2: m has ν2(m) = 2, 1 ≤ m ≤ 84, 3 ∤ m, 7 ∤ m.\\nNote these sets are disjoint.\\n\\nCount S1 (odd m not divisible by 3 or 7):\\nOdd m in [1,84]: there are 42 odd numbers from 1 to 83.\\nWe need to exclude those divisible by 3 or 7.\\nWe can count directly using residues modulo 21 (LCM of 3 and 7) but restricted to odds.\\nOdd residues mod 21 are: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19.\\nAmong these, divisible by 3: residues 3,9,15.\\nDivisible by 7: residue 7.\\nDivisible by 21 would be residue 0, not odd among these residues, so ignore.\\nThus invalid odd residues: 3,7,9,15. So valid residues: 1,5,11,13,17,19. There are 6 valid odd residues mod 21.\\nNow find how many m between 1 and 84 with those residues.\\n84 / 21 = 4, so there are 4 complete blocks of length 21.\\nEach block has exactly one representative of each residue.\\nThus number of odd m in [1,84] with valid residues is 6 residues × 4 blocks = 24.\\nSo |S1| = 24.\\n\\nCount S2 (m with ν2(m) = 2, no factor 3 or 7):\\nIf ν2(m) = 2, write m = 4t, where t is odd (since no higher 2-power). Also 4t ≤ 84 → t ≤ 21.\\nSo t runs over odd integers between 1 and 21 inclusive.\\nList odd t between 1 and 21: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21 → 11 numbers.\\nWe need conditions 3 ∤ m and 7 ∤ m.\\nBecause m = 4t and 4 is coprime to 3 and 7, divisibility by 3 or 7 for m is equivalent to divisibility of t by 3 or 7.\\nSo we need t odd, 1 ≤ t ≤ 21, with 3 ∤ t and 7 ∤ t.\\nNow repeat the same analysis mod 21 for t.\\nOdd residues mod 21 are same set: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19.\\nInvalid residues (divisible by 3 or 7): 3,7,9,15.\\nValid: 1,5,11,13,17,19 → 6 residues.\\nBut now t only runs from 1 to 21, which is exactly one full block of length 21.\\nSo we get 6 valid t.\\nThus |S2| = 6.\\n\\nTotal valid m in [1,84] is |S1| + |S2| = 24 + 6 = 30.\\nHence there are 30 possible values of m, and hence 30 values of k (each k = 35m) with k ≤ 2940 making (205800, 35k) a happy pair.\\n\\nSo the answers are:\\nProblem 1: 5/9\\nProblem 2: 30\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"5/9\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"30\"\n}",
