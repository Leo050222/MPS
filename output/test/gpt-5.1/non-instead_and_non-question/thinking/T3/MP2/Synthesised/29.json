  "math_problem": "Find all prime numbers $p,q,r$ , such that $\\frac{p}{q}-\\frac{4}{r+1}=1$ Let $n = r + 2009$, where $r$ is the prime number such that $r + 1$ equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term. FemtoPravis is walking on an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard that wraps around at its edges (so squares on the left edge of the chessboard are adjacent to squares on the right edge, and similarly for the top and bottom edges). Each femtosecond, FemtoPravis moves in one of the four diagonal directions uniformly at random. After $n$ femtoseconds, what is the probability that FemtoPravis is at his original location?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n  \"reasoning\": \"We first solve the Diophantine equation in primes: p/q - 4/(r+1) = 1, with p,q,r prime. Rearranging: p/q = 1 + 4/(r+1) = (r+5)/(r+1). Thus p = k(r+5), q = k(r+1) for some integer k. Since q must be prime, k = 1 and r+1 must be of the form 2,3,5,... Likewise, p must be prime so r+5 must be prime.\\n\\nLet r+1 = m be prime. Then r = m-1 and r+5 = m+4 must also be prime. We search over primes m for which m+4 is also prime (prime pairs at distance 4):\\n- m=2 → r=1 (not prime)\\n- m=3 → r=2 (prime), m+4=7 (prime)\\n- m=5 → r=4 (not prime)\\n- m=7 → r=6 (not prime)\\n- m=11 → r=10 (not prime)\\n- m=13 → r=12 (not prime)\\n- m=17 → r=16 (not prime)\\n- m=19 → r=18 (not prime)\\nAnd in general, r = m-1 is even for any odd prime m>2, hence not prime. Thus the only possible candidate where r is prime is r=2 from m=3.\\nFor m=3: r=2 (prime), q = r+1 = 3 (prime), p = r+5 = 7 (prime). This satisfies the equation: 7/3 - 4/3 = 3/3 = 1. Therefore (p,q,r) = (7,3,2) is the unique triple.\\n\\nWe are told to define n = r + 2009, where r is this prime with r+1 the denominator of the subtracted fraction. So r=2 and n = 2 + 2009 = 2011.\\n\\nNow consider FemtoPravis on an 8×8 toroidal chessboard. Each step he moves one of the four diagonal directions with equal probability. Represent the board as coordinates (x,y) in Z_8 × Z_8. A diagonal step changes (x,y) by (+1,+1), (+1,-1), (-1,+1), or (-1,-1) mod 8. Thus each step changes x by ±1 and y by ±1.\\n\\nAfter t steps, x changes by the sum of t independent ±1 increments, and similarly y. Importantly, x and y increments are independent given the diagonal move: for each step, the x-increment is +1 for two of the four moves and -1 for the other two. Same for y. Given a sequence of x-increments, the y-increments are determined by which of the two diagonals was chosen at each step, but because of symmetry, the distribution of (x,y) positions depends only on parity and divisibility constraints.\\n\\nWe need the probability that after n steps he returns to the original location (0,0). On Z_8, the total displacement in x after n steps must be congruent to 0 mod 8, and the same for y. The displacement in x is an odd or even integer depending on n: after n steps, the displacement parity equals n mod 2 because each step is ±1. Specifically, after n steps, the displacement in x is congruent to n (mod 2). Similarly for y.\\n\\nFor the walker to be back at the origin, the displacement in x must be 0 mod 8, hence even. Likewise, the displacement in y must be 0 mod 8, hence even. Thus both displacements must be even, which requires n to be even. If n is odd, the displacement in x and y are both odd, so they cannot be 0 mod 8.\\n\\nOur n = 2011, which is odd. Therefore it is impossible to return to the starting square after 2011 diagonal moves on an 8×8 torus, and the probability is 0.\\n\\nThus the required probability is 0.\",\n  \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
