  "math_problem": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. Let $N$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen. James writes down three integers. Alex picks some two of those integers, takes the average of them, and adds the result to the third integer. If the possible final results Alex could get are $(N - 86)$, 13, and 37, what are the three integers James originally chose?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Let the three integers James chose be a, b, c. The operation Alex performs is: pick two of these integers, say x and y, compute their average (x + y)/2, and add it to the third integer z, so the result is (x + y)/2 + z. There are thus three possible results: R1 = (b + c)/2 + a, R2 = (a + c)/2 + b, R3 = (a + b)/2 + c.\\n\\nWe are told that the set of possible final results is {N - 86, 13, 37}, where N is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen.\\n\\nStep 1: Determine N using the blood-antigen context.\\n\\nThere are 8 antigens; each student has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of these antigens. So there are 2^8 = 256 possible subsets, matching the 256 students, so each possible subset appears exactly once.\\n\\nFor any specific antigen, among all 2^8 subsets, that antigen is present in exactly half of them, i.e., 2^7 = 128 subsets. Since each subset is assigned to exactly one student, the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen is N = 128.\\n\\nTherefore N - 86 = 128 - 86 = 42. Thus the three possible results Alex could get are 42, 13, and 37.\\n\\nStep 2: Express the sums a + b, b + c, c + a.\\n\\nWe have:\\nR1 = (b + c)/2 + a = (a + b + c)/2 + a/2.\\nBut it is more convenient to use pairwise sums directly:\\nLet S_ab = a + b,\\nS_bc = b + c,\\nS_ca = c + a,\\nand total S = a + b + c.\\nWe can rewrite each result:\\nR1 = (b + c)/2 + a = S_bc/2 + a,\\nR2 = (a + c)/2 + b = S_ca/2 + b,\\nR3 = (a + b)/2 + c = S_ab/2 + c.\\n\\nAlso note:\\nS_ab + S_bc + S_ca = 2(a + b + c) = 2S.\\n\\nHowever, a simpler method is to work from these linear forms more directly by considering a, b, c as unknowns and assigning the three results 13, 37, 42 in some order to R1, R2, R3.\\n\\nStep 3: Set up equations.\\n\\nWrite explicit equations:\\n(1) (b + c)/2 + a = r1,\\n(2) (a + c)/2 + b = r2,\\n(3) (a + b)/2 + c = r3,\\nwhere {r1, r2, r3} = {13, 37, 42}.\\n\\nMultiply each by 2:\\n(1') b + c + 2a = 2r1,\\n(2') a + c + 2b = 2r2,\\n(3') a + b + 2c = 2r3.\\n\\nNow we solve this linear system for a, b, c in terms of r1, r2, r3.\\n\\nAdd all three equations:\\n(b + c + 2a) + (a + c + 2b) + (a + b + 2c)\\n= (2a + a + a) + (b + 2b + b) + (c + c + 2c)\\n= 4a + 4b + 4c = 4(a + b + c).\\n\\nRight-hand side is 2r1 + 2r2 + 2r3 = 2(r1 + r2 + r3).\\n\\nSo 4(a + b + c) = 2(r1 + r2 + r3) ⇒ a + b + c = (r1 + r2 + r3)/2.\\n\\nNow we solve individually via elimination. From (1'):\\n2a = 2r1 - b - c.\\nSimilarly (2'): 2b = 2r2 - a - c.\\n(3'): 2c = 2r3 - a - b.\\n\\nBut a more direct approach is to subtract equations pairwise.\\n\\nSubtract (2') from (1'):\\n(b + c + 2a) - (a + c + 2b) = 2r1 - 2r2.\\nLeft side: b + c + 2a - a - c - 2b = (b - 2b) + (c - c) + (2a - a) = -b + a.\\nSo a - b = 2(r1 - r2).\\n\\nSubtract (3') from (2'):\\n(a + c + 2b) - (a + b + 2c) = 2r2 - 2r3.\\nLeft side: a + c + 2b - a - b - 2c = (c - 2c) + (2b - b) = -c + b.\\nSo b - c = 2(r2 - r3).\\n\\nSubtract (1') from (3'):\\n(a + b + 2c) - (b + c + 2a) = 2r3 - 2r1.\\nLeft side: a + b + 2c - b - c - 2a = (a - 2a) + (2c - c) = -a + c.\\nSo c - a = 2(r3 - r1).\\n\\nThese three differences are consistent (they must sum to zero), and from them we can express a, b, c relative to each other once r1, r2, r3 are fixed.\\n\\nStep 4: Plug the specific values 13, 37, 42.\\n\\nWe need to assign which of R1, R2, R3 equals 13, 37, 42. Instead of trying all permutations blindly, we can use the sum property:\\na + b + c = (r1 + r2 + r3)/2,\\nwhere {r1, r2, r3} = {13, 37, 42}. So r1 + r2 + r3 = 13 + 37 + 42 = 92.\\nThus a + b + c = 92/2 = 46.\\n\\nThis holds regardless of the permutation, so a + b + c = 46 for sure.\\n\\nNow we can express a, b, c directly from the system by solving once, using symbolic r1, r2, r3, and then plug in.\\n\\nSolve systematically:\\nFrom (1'): b + c + 2a = 2r1.\\nWe know b + c = (a + b + c) - a = 46 - a.\\nSo 46 - a + 2a = 2r1 ⇒ 46 + a = 2r1 ⇒ a = 2r1 - 46.\\n\\nSimilarly from (2'): a + c + 2b = 2r2.\\nHere a + c = 46 - b, so 46 - b + 2b = 2r2 ⇒ 46 + b = 2r2 ⇒ b = 2r2 - 46.\\n\\nFrom (3'): a + b + 2c = 2r3.\\nHere a + b = 46 - c, so 46 - c + 2c = 2r3 ⇒ 46 + c = 2r3 ⇒ c = 2r3 - 46.\\n\\nThus, given an assignment of r1, r2, r3 to {13, 37, 42}, we get:\\n(a, b, c) = (2r1 - 46, 2r2 - 46, 2r3 - 46) in that order.\\n\\nBut R1, R2, R3 correspond to the expressions involving (b + c)/2 + a, etc. However, as a set, {a, b, c} depends only on the multiset {r1, r2, r3}, not their order, because if we permute r1, r2, r3, we just permute a, b, c. So the unordered triple {a, b, c} is:\\n{2*13 - 46, 2*37 - 46, 2*42 - 46} = {26 - 46, 74 - 46, 84 - 46} = {-20, 28, 38}.\\n\\nThus James’s three integers are -20, 28, and 38 (in some order). We can check explicitly that the three operation results are indeed 13, 37, and 42.\\n\\nCheck:\\nTake a = -20, b = 28, c = 38.\\nCompute the three possible results.\\n1) Average of b and c, then add a:\\n(b + c)/2 + a = (28 + 38)/2 - 20 = 66/2 - 20 = 33 - 20 = 13.\\n2) Average of a and c, then add b:\\n(a + c)/2 + b = (-20 + 38)/2 + 28 = 18/2 + 28 = 9 + 28 = 37.\\n3) Average of a and b, then add c:\\n(a + b)/2 + c = (-20 + 28)/2 + 38 = 8/2 + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42.\\n\\nThe three results are exactly 13, 37, and 42 = N - 86, as required. Therefore the three integers James originally chose are -20, 28, and 38.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-20, 28, 38\"\n}",
