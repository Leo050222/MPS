Check:\\n  m = 0: 0 - n^5 = 0 ⇒ n^5 = 0 ⇒ n = 0.\\n  n = 0: m^5 - 0 = 0 ⇒ m = 0.\\nSo (0,0) is one solution.\\nNow assume m and n are both nonzero.\\nLet d = gcd(m,n), m = d a, n = d b with gcd(a,b) = 1.\\nThen m^5 - n^5 = d^5 (a^5 - b^5), and 16 m n = 16 d^2 a b, so\\n  d^5 (a^5 - b^5) = 16 d^2 a b ⇒ d^3 (a^5 - b^5) = 16 a b.\\nSince gcd(a,b)=1, gcd(a^5 - b^5, a) = gcd(b^5,a)=1 and similarly gcd(a^5 - b^5, b)=1.\\nThus gcd(a^5 - b^5, a b) = 1, so a^5 - b^5 divides 16.\\nTherefore a^5 - b^5 ∈ {±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±16}.\\nAlso |a|,|b| must be small. We now search integer pairs (a,b) with gcd(a,b)=1 and small absolute values, satisfying this divisibility and then the original equation.\\nInstead of solving the divisibility directly, do a direct small search idea logically:\\nBecause |a^5 - b^5| ≤ 16, |a| and |b| must be at most 2.\\nCheck possible (a,b) ∈ {−2, −1, 1, 2}^2 excluding (0,0) and ensuring gcd(a,b)=1.\\nCompute a^5:\\n  1^5=1, (−1)^5=−1, 2^5=32, (−2)^5=−32.\\nTry all possibilities:\\n1) a=1, b=1 ⇒ a^5−b^5=0, not allowed since it must divide 16 and give nonzero d^3(a^5−b^5).\\n2) a=1, b=−1 ⇒ a^5−b^5 = 1−(−1)=2.\\n   Equation d^3 * 2 = 16 a b = 16 * 1 * (−1) = −16 ⇒ 2 d^3 = −16 ⇒ d^3 = −8 ⇒ d=−2.\\n   So m = d a = −2*1 = −2, n = d b = −2*(−1) = 2.\\n   Check in original: (−2)^5 − 2^5 = −32 − 32 = −64, 16 m n = 16*(−2)*2 = −64, works.\\n3) a=−1, b=1 ⇒ a^5−b^5 = −1−1 = −2.\\n   Then d^3 * (−2) = 16*(−1)*1 = −16 ⇒ −2 d^3 = −16 ⇒ d^3 = 8 ⇒ d=2.\\n   So m = 2*(−1)=−2, n = 2*1=2, same pair (−2,2).\\n4) a=1, b=2 ⇒ a^5−b^5 = 1−32 = −31, not divisor of 16.\\n5) a=2, b=1 ⇒ 32−1 = 31, not divisor.\\n6) a=1, b=−2 ⇒ 1−(−32)=33, not divisor.\\n7) a=−2, b=1 ⇒ −32−1=−33, not divisor.\\n8) a=−1, b=−2 ⇒ −1−(−32) =31, not divisor.\\n9) a=−2, b=−1 ⇒ −32−(−1)=−31, not divisor.\\n10) a=2, b=−1 ⇒ 32−(−1)=33, not divisor.\\n11) a=−1, b=2 ⇒ −1−32=−33, not divisor.\\n12) a=2, b=2 or −2,−2 gives a^5−b^5=0, not allowed.\\nThus the only solution with m,n not both zero is (m,n) = (−2,2) (and symmetrically we already got that). We should also check the symmetric possibility (2,−2) directly in original equation:\\n  2^5−(−2)^5 = 32−(−32)=64, 16*2*(−2)=−64 ⇒ not a solution. So only (−2,2).\\nAlso we already have (0,0).\\nWe should ensure no other solution with one of m,n zero: we checked and only (0,0).\\nHence the integer solutions are (m,n) = (0,0) and (−2,2).\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have polynomial x^3 − a x^2 + b x − 48 with positive roots p<q<r.\\nBy Vieta:\\n  p + q + r = a,\\n  pq + pr + qr = b,\\n  p q r = 48.\\nWe want the minimum of\\n  S = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r.\\nWrite S using pq r = 48:\\n  1/p = (q r)/(p q r) = q r/48,\\n  2/q = 2 p r/48,\\n  3/r = 3 p q/48.\\nSo S = (q r + 2 p r + 3 p q)/48.\\nDefine function of positive real variables p<q<r with constraint p q r = 48, and minimize S.\\nIgnore temporarily the ordering p<q<r and minimize over all positive p,q,r with p q r fixed. Order constraints normally do not affect the minimum because we can relabel roots; if an unconstrained minimum occurs with some order, we can rename to enforce p<q<r.\\nLet’s use Lagrange multipliers.\\nLet F(p,q,r) = q r + 2 p r + 3 p q + λ (p q r − 48).\\nPartial derivatives set to zero:\\n  ∂F/∂p: 2 r + 3 q + λ q r = 0 … (1)\\n  ∂F/∂q: r + 3 p + λ p r = 0 … (2)\\n  ∂F/∂r: q + 2 p + λ p q = 0 … (3)\\n  constraint: p q r = 48 … (4).\\nSubtract (2)−(3) to simplify:\\n  (r + 3 p + λ p r) − (q + 2 p + λ p q) = 0 ⇒ r − q + p + λ p (r − q) = 0.\\nFactor r−q:\\n  (r−q)(1 + λ p) + p = 0 ⇒ (r−q)(1 + λ p) = −p.\\nSimilarly subtract (1)−(2):\\n  (2 r + 3 q + λ q r) − (r + 3 p + λ p r) = 0 ⇒ r + 3(q − p) + λ r (q − p) = 0.\\nFactor (q−p):\\n  r + (q−p)(3 + λ r) = 0 … (A).\\nAnd subtract (1)−(3):\\n  (2 r + 3 q + λ q r) − (q + 2 p + λ p q) = 0 ⇒ 2 r + 2 q − 2 p + λ (q r − p q) = 0.\\nFactor 2 and q:\\n  2(r + q − p) + λ q (r − p) = 0 … (B).\\nThis is messy, so instead use a more direct symmetric approach: often the optimum occurs when two variables are equal if the expressions are reasonably symmetric but with different coefficients we should test patterns.\\nTry r = q first.\\nIf r=q, then p q r = p q^2 = 48 ⇒ p = 48 / q^2.\\nThen S = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r = 1/p + 5/q.\\nBut 1/p = q^2 /48, so S(q) = q^2/48 + 5/q for q>0.\\nTo minimize S(q): derivative:\\n  S'(q) = (2 q)/48 − 5/q^2 = q/24 − 5/q^2.\\nSet to zero:\\n  q/24 = 5/q^2 ⇒ q^3 = 120 ⇒ q = 120^{1/3}.\\nThen p = 48 / q^2 = 48 / 120^{2/3}.\\nCheck ordering p<q<r: here r=q, so not strictly increasing; p<q yes (since p smaller), but q<r fails.\\nSo this is not allowed because roots must be distinct with p<q<r.\\nBut it suggests the minimum might occur at nearby unequal values, close to this symmetric point.\\nNow look at q = p or p = r or such; but p<q<r rules out equality in the optimum, but we can use equality cases as candidates of infimum (limit of admissible points) if S is continuous.\\nIf the function S under the constraint achieves its global minimum in the interior of the domain, that interior point will have equalities from Lagrange equations and likely distinct p,q,r. But the easy symmetric case r=q already gives us a stationary point of a reduced problem (but not the full 3-variable unconstrained one). To see if the true minimum is this value, approximate or analyze full Lagrange system.\\nLet’s attempt a more structured approach.\\nWe suspect that the minimal S over distinct positive p<q<r is arbitrarily close to the minimal value over all positive p,q,r (allowing equality) because we can perturb the roots slightly while keeping product fixed, and S is continuous; so the true infimum with strict inequalities equals the minimum over the closure where equalities allowed.\\nThus we can legitimately minimize over all positive p,q,r (not insisting distinct). Then the minimum may occur with some equalities, and that value will be the infimum for distinct case.\\nSo we minimize S(p,q,r) = (q r + 2 p r + 3 p q)/48 subject to p q r=48 for all p,q,r>0.\\nUse full Lagrange multipliers directly but notice we can use the substitution p=48/(q r) into S.\\nThen S as function of q,r:\\n  p = 48/(q r).\\n  S = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r = (q r)/48 * 48? Wait: 1/p = q r/48 (since p q r=48): correct, and 2/q, 3/r as usual.\\nSo S(q,r) = q r/48 + 2/q + 3/r.\\nNow we have a two-variable constrained-free optimization with q>0,r>0. The ordering p<q<r is not needed for the infimum; any (q,r) positive allowed.\\nCompute partial derivatives:\\n  ∂S/∂q = r/48 − 2/q^2.\\nSet to zero:\\n  r/48 = 2/q^2 ⇒ r = 96 / q^2. … (i)\\n  ∂S/∂r = q/48 − 3/r^2.\\nSet to zero:\\n  q/48 = 3/r^2 ⇒ q = 144 / r^2. … (ii)\\nSubstitute (i) into (ii):\\n  q = 144 / r^2 with r = 96 / q^2.\\nThen r^2 = (96 / q^2)^2 = 9216 / q^4.\\nSo\\n  q = 144 / (9216 / q^4) = 144 q^4 / 9216 = (144/9216) q^4.\\nCompute 144/9216. 9216 = 64*144, so 144/9216 = 1/64.\\nThus q = (1/64) q^4 ⇒ multiply both sides by 64/q (q>0): 64 = q^3 ⇒ q = 4.\\nThen r from (i): r = 96 / q^2 = 96 / 16 = 6.\\nThen p from product constraint: p q r = 48 ⇒ p * 4 * 6 = 48 ⇒ p = 48 / 24 = 2.\\nSo the stationary point is (p,q,r) = (2,4,6).\\nCheck S value:\\n  S = 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/6 = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3/2.\\nWe should verify this is a minimum. S→∞ as any variable →0+ or as variables →∞ while product fixed (since at least one term like 1/p blows up). The stationary point is unique solution of derivative equations in interior. Thus it is the global minimum over p,q,r>0.\\nNow check ordering: indeed 2<4<6, so p=2,q=4,r=6 respects p<q<r.\\nTherefore the minimum of 1/p + 2/q + 3/r is 3/2.\\nCorresponding polynomial is (x−2)(x−4)(x−6) = x^3 − 12 x^2 + 44 x − 48, so a=12,b=44, valid.\\nHence Problem 2 answer is 3/2.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: integer pairs (m,n) are (0,0) and (−2,2).\\nProblem 2: minimum possible value is 3/2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"(0,0), (-2,2)\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
