In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nThere are 8 antigens; each student has a distinct subset of them. So the 256 students correspond to all 2^8 subsets of {1,…,8}. Quito picks a random subset of students and an order on that subset. Equivalently, each student is assigned an independent random position in a random permutation of all 256, and only those before Quito stops matter, but because Quito's stopping rule is “random subset,” we can instead imagine he actually forms a full random permutation and bites everyone, accumulating antigens as he goes. For each bitten student, their suffering equals the number of antigens Quito currently has that the student does not, i.e. the size of (Quito's antigen set) \\\\ (student's antigen set).\\n\\nLet S_i be the set of antigens of student i, and let T_i be Quito's antigen set immediately before biting i. Then the suffering of i is |T_i \\\\ S_i|. Consider a fixed antigen a. Define an indicator X_{i,a} = 1 if antigen a is in T_i but not in S_i, else 0. Then total suffering over all students is sum_i |T_i \\\\ S_i| = sum_i sum_a X_{i,a} = sum_a (sum_i X_{i,a}). By linearity of expectation, E[total suffering] = sum_a E[sum_i X_{i,a}]. All 8 antigens are symmetric, so E[sum_i X_{i,a}] is the same for each antigen a. Let E_a denote E[sum_i X_{i,a}]. Then answer = 8 * E_a.\\n\\nReduce to a single antigen pattern over the 256 students. Among the 256 subsets of {1,…,8}, exactly half (128) contain a, and half (128) do not. So for antigen a, 128 students have it (H-type), 128 don't (N-type). Quito's antigen-status for a flips from 0 to 1 at the moment he first bites an H-type; after that it stays 1. A student i suffers from antigen a exactly if at their bite time Quito has already seen some H-type (so his a-status is 1) and i is N-type. Thus, for a single antigen, the total contribution equals number of N-type students that come after the first H-type in the random permutation of the 256 students.\\n\\nIn any random permutation where both H and N exist (here both counts are > 0), the first student with antigen a must be H or N. But we only care about N after first H. However, observe: the segment of the permutation after the first H contains all remaining 255 students except that particular first H; so its size is 255. Among these 255 positions, the number of N-type students is just 128 minus possibly whether the first H was H (it always is). More carefully: we have 128 H, 128 N. The first H is some particular H (there must be at least one H before any N that counts? No; we define first H as first H-type in the permutation). After the first H, we have the remaining 127 H plus 128 N, total 255 students. So the count of N-types after the first H is exactly 128, independent of permutation. Thus, for antigen a, the total suffering contribution is deterministically 128. Therefore E_a = 128.\\n\\nSince there are 8 antigens, expected total suffering = 8 * 128 = 1024.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nLet James's integers be a, b, c. Alex's operations:\\n1) Pick a, b; average (a + b)/2; add to c → result R1 = c + (a + b)/2.\\n2) Pick b, c; average (b + c)/2; add to a → R2 = a + (b + c)/2.\\n3) Pick c, a; average (c + a)/2; add to b → R3 = b + (c + a)/2.\\nRewrite: R1 = (a + b + 2c)/2, R2 = (b + c + 2a)/2, R3 = (c + a + 2b)/2.\\nThe set {R1, R2, R3} is {42, 13, 37} in some order, while a, b, c are integers, so each Rk must be integer, so the numerators must be even.\\nLet S = a + b + c.\\nCompute:\\nR1 + R2 + R3 = ( (a + b + 2c) + (b + c + 2a) + (c + a + 2b) ) / 2\\n= ( (a + 2a + a) + (b + 2b + b) + (2c + c + c) ) / 2\\n= (4a + 4b + 4c)/2 = 2(a + b + c) = 2S.\\nBut R1 + R2 + R3 = 42 + 13 + 37 = 92. So 2S = 92 ⇒ S = 46.\\nNow express each Rk by S:\\nR1 numerator: a + b + 2c = (a + b + c) + c = S + c, so R1 = (S + c)/2.\\nR2 = (S + a)/2, R3 = (S + b)/2.\\nThus the multiset { (S + a)/2, (S + b)/2, (S + c)/2 } = {42, 13, 37}.\\nMultiply by 2: {S + a, S + b, S + c} = {84, 26, 74}.\\nBut S = 46, so {46 + a, 46 + b, 46 + c} = {84, 26, 74}.\\nThus {a, b, c} = {84 - 46, 26 - 46, 74 - 46} = {38, -20, 28}.\\nCheck parity constraints: a + b + 2c = 38 + (-20) + 56 = 74 → R1 = 37; b + c + 2a = -20 + 28 + 76 = 84 → R2 = 42; c + a + 2b = 28 + 38 - 40 = 26 → R3 = 13. Works. Therefore the three integers are 38, -20, 28 (order not specified).\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1024\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"38, -20, 28\"\n}",
