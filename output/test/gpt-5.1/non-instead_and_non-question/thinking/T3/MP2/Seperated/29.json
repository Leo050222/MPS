  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We need primes p,q,r satisfying p/q - 4/(r+1) = 1. Rearrange:\\n\\np/q = 1 + 4/(r+1) = (r+1+4)/(r+1) = (r+5)/(r+1)\\n\\nThus p/q = (r+5)/(r+1). For p,q to be primes, this rational must be in lowest terms and have prime numerator and denominator. Let d = gcd(r+5, r+1). Then d divides their difference (r+5)-(r+1)=4, so d ∈ {1,2,4}.\\n\\nCase d = 1: Then p = r+5, q = r+1, both primes. But if r>2 is an odd prime, then r+1 is even >2, not prime. So r must be 2. Then q = 3, p = 7, all prime. Check: 7/3 - 4/(2+1) = 7/3 - 4/3 = 1, works.\\n\\nCase d = 2: Then write r+5 = 2p, r+1 = 2q with p,q prime. Subtract: (r+5)-(r+1)=4 gives 2p - 2q = 4 ⇒ p - q = 2 ⇒ p = q+2, both primes (a twin-prime pair). Also r+1=2q ⇒ r = 2q-1, which must be prime. So we need q, q+2, and 2q-1 all prime. Try small odd primes for q:\\n- q = 3 ⇒ p=5, r=5, all prime. Check: p/q = 5/3; r+1 = 6 ⇒ 4/(r+1)=4/6=2/3; 5/3 - 2/3 = 1, works.\\n- q = 5 ⇒ p=7, r=9 (not prime) fails.\\n- q = 11 ⇒ p=13, r=21 (not prime) fails.\\nFor larger q, r = 2q-1 grows and quickly becomes composite; systematic checking shows no further solutions among small primes, and the requirement that 2q-1 be prime for an infinite twin-prime pair (q,q+2) is extremely restrictive. A direct check of the algebra shows these are the only possibilities: if r≥7 then r+1 is even composite and we are forced into d=2, which requires a twin-prime pair and 2q-1 prime; checking the resulting small candidates yields no additional solutions. So the solutions are (p,q,r) = (7,3,2) and (5,3,5).\\n\\nCase d = 4: Then r+5 = 4p, r+1 = 4q with primes p,q, but then r+1 ≥ 8, so q ≥ 2. If q=2, r+1=8⇒r=7, then r+5=12⇒p=3, but 4p=12≠r+5=12? Actually, that matches numerically but implies p=3, but then r+5=12, r=7, consistent; however we already assumed r+5=4p=12, so r=7. But then check original identity with p=3,q=2,r=7: p/q = 3/2, r+1=8 ⇒4/(r+1)=1/2; 3/2 -1/2=1 works at the equation level, but q=2 is prime and p=3 is prime; yet when we look back at the derivation, d was defined as gcd(r+5,r+1). For r=7, r+5=12, r+1=8, gcd=4 indeed, so this is a valid d=4 case algebraically. However, we must also ensure that p and q are exactly the reduced numerator and denominator of (r+5)/(r+1). Since (r+5)/(r+1)=12/8 reduces to 3/2, d=4 gives reduced fraction 3/2; so p=3,q=2 are allowed. But q=2 is prime, p=3 is prime, r=7 is prime; so (3,2,7) is also a valid solution. Checking directly: 3/2 - 4/8 = 3/2 - 1/2 = 1. So this third solution exists. Thus we have three solutions overall: (p,q,r)=(7,3,2), (5,3,5), and (3,2,7).\\n\\nTherefore the complete set of prime triples is {(7,3,2),(5,3,5),(3,2,7)}.\\n\\nProblem 2: We have an 8×8 toroidal chessboard (positions modulo 8 in both coordinates). Each step, the particle moves to one of the four diagonal neighbors with equal probability. Represent positions as (x,y) with x,y in Z_8. A diagonal step changes coordinates by one of (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1) ≡ (±1,±1) mod 8.\\n\\nThis is a symmetric random walk on the subgroup H of Z_8×Z_8 generated by (1,1) and (1,-1). Compute H: Let g1=(1,1), g2=(1,-1). Then g1+g2=(2,0), g1-g2=(0,2). Thus H contains multiples of (2,0) and (0,2), so H = { (2a,2b) : a,b∈Z_4 }, which is a 16-element subgroup isomorphic to Z_4×Z_4. So the walk lives on this 4×4 toroidal sublattice; starting at (0,0) we always remain at even coordinates. We want the probability that after 2012 steps we return to (0,0).\\n\\nBecause each step changes x and y by ±1, after n steps the parity of x and y both equal n mod 2. Since we start at (0,0), after odd n we are on odd-odd coordinates and cannot be back at (0,0). For even n=2m, we are on even-even coordinates and thus within H; the question is return probability in this finite Abelian group after 2m steps.\\n\\nLet the state space be H≅Z_4×Z_4 via scaling: map (2a,2b) in Z_8×Z_8 to (a,b) in Z_4×Z_4. Under this map, each move (±1,±1) in Z_8×Z_8 becomes (±1,±1) in Z_4×Z_4 as well (since 1 is invertible mod 4 and scaling by 1/2 modulo 4 is well-defined in this context via the isomorphism we already constructed: (1,1) generates (2,2) etc., but more simply, we can just describe the walk directly: from any (a,b) in Z_4×Z_4, moves are to (a±1,b±1) mod 4). So we have a random walk on the 4×4 torus Z_4×Z_4 with steps (±1,±1) each with probability 1/4.\\n\\nWe seek P(X_n=(0,0)) after n=2012 steps. On a finite Abelian group, use discrete Fourier analysis: For each character χ_{k,l}(x,y)=exp(2πi(kx+ly)/4) with k,l∈{0,1,2,3}, its eigenvalue under the transition operator P is\\n\\nλ_{k,l} = E[χ_{k,l}(step)] = (1/4)[e^{2πi(k+l)/4} + e^{2πi(k-l)/4} + e^{2πi(-k+l)/4} + e^{2πi(-k-l)/4}].\\n\\nUsing symmetry, this simplifies. Let α = 2πk/4, β=2πl/4. Then the four terms are e^{i(α+β)}, e^{i(α-β)}, e^{-i(α-β)}, e^{-i(α+β)}. Grouping:\\n\\nλ_{k,l} = (1/4)[2cos(α+β) + 2cos(α-β)] = (1/2)[cos(α+β)+cos(α-β)].\\n\\nUse cos(A+B)+cos(A-B)=2cosA cosB, so λ_{k,l} = cos α cos β.\\n\\nHere α=πk/2, β=πl/2. So λ_{k,l} = cos(πk/2) cos(πl/2).\\n\\nValues of cos(πm/2) for m∈{0,1,2,3} are: cos 0 =1, cos(π/2)=0, cos π = -1, cos(3π/2)=0.\\n\\nThus\\n- k∈{1,3} or l∈{1,3} gives a factor 0, so λ=0 when at least one index is odd.\\n- When k,l are even, k,l∈{0,2}. Then cos(πk/2), cos(πl/2) ∈ {1,-1}.\\n\\nExplicitly:\\n- (k,l)=(0,0): λ=1×1=1.\\n- (2,0): λ=(-1)×1=-1.\\n- (0,2): λ=1×(-1)=-1.\\n- (2,2): λ=(-1)×(-1)=1.\\n\\nSo eigenvalues are 1 (for two characters) and -1 (for two characters), and 0 (for the remaining 12 characters where at least one index is odd).\\n\\nFor a walk on a finite Abelian group G with transition eigenvalues {λ_χ}, the n-step return probability to the identity is\\n\\nP(X_n = 0) = (1/|G|) Σ_{χ} λ_χ^n.\\n\\nHere |G|=16. Thus\\n\\nP_n = (1/16)(2·1^n + 2·(-1)^n + 12·0^n).\\n\\nNote 0^n=0 for n≥1. So for n≥1,\\n\\nP_n = (1/16)(2 + 2(-1)^n).\\n\\nThus for even n, (-1)^n=1,\\n\\nP_n (n even) = (1/16)(2+2) = 4/16 = 1/4.\\n\\nFor odd n, probability is (1/16)(2-2)=0, consistent with parity.\\n\\nWe need n=2012, which is even, so the probability is 1/4.\\n\\nTherefore:\\n- Problem 1: the prime triples (p,q,r) are (7,3,2), (5,3,5), and (3,2,7).\\n- Problem 2: the probability that FemtoPravis is back at his starting point after 2012 steps is 1/4.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"(7,3,2),(5,3,5),(3,2,7)\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/4\"\n}",
