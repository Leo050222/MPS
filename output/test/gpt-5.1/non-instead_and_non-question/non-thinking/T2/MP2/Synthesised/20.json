Then we must first find all such n and the common k.\\n\\n1) Find all n with integer value of (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7).\\n\\nLet (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) = t, where t is an integer.\\nThen\\nn^3 + 3 = t(n^2 + 7)\\n=> n^3 + 3 = t n^2 + 7 t\\n=> n^3 - t n^2 + (3 - 7t) = 0.\\n\\nWe instead perform polynomial division:\\n(n^3 + 3) ÷ (n^2 + 7).\\n\\nn^3/(n^2) = n, so first term of quotient is n.\\nMultiply back: n(n^2 + 7) = n^3 + 7n.\\nSubtract: (n^3 + 3) - (n^3 + 7n) = -7n + 3.\\n\\nThus\\n(n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) = n + (-7n + 3)/(n^2 + 7).\\n\\nFor this to be an integer, we need n^2 + 7 | (-7n + 3).\\nTake absolute values and compare sizes.\\nFor n ≥ 4,\\n n^2 + 7 > 7n + 3,\\nso if n^2 + 7 divides 7n - 3, the only possibility is that 7n - 3 = 0, because otherwise the divisor is larger than the dividend.\\n\\nSo for n ≥ 4 we must have 7n - 3 = 0 => n = 3/7, not an integer. Hence no solutions for n ≥ 4.\\n\\nCheck n = 1,2,3 explicitly.\\n\\nn = 1:\\n(n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) = (1 + 3)/(1 + 7) = 4/8 = 1/2, not integer.\\n\\nn = 2:\\n(8 + 3)/(4 + 7) = 11/11 = 1, integer.\\n\\nn = 3:\\n(27 + 3)/(9 + 7) = 30/16 = 15/8, not integer.\\n\\nThus the only positive integer n with integer value is n = 2.\\n\\nEvaluate the expression at n = 2:\\n(2^3 + 3)/(2^2 + 7) = (8 + 3)/(4 + 7) = 11/11 = 1.\\n\\nBy the problem statement, we are given that for each such positive integer n, it equals the value of the expression plus k:\\nFor n = 2:\\n2 = 1 + k => k = 1.\\n\\nSo k = 1.\\n\\n2) Now we find all m such that the zeros of 2x^2 - m x - 8 differ by |m - k| = |m - 1|.\\n\\nGiven quadratic 2x^2 - m x - 8 = 0, let the roots be r1 and r2.\\n\\nFor ax^2 + bx + c = 0 (a ≠ 0), the difference between roots in absolute value is\\n|r1 - r2| = sqrt(Δ) / |a|,\\nwhere Δ = b^2 - 4ac (the discriminant).\\n\\nHere a = 2, b = -m, c = -8.\\nThen\\nΔ = (-m)^2 - 4(2)(-8) = m^2 + 64.\\n\\nThe difference between roots:\\n|r1 - r2| = sqrt(m^2 + 64)/|2| = (1/2) sqrt(m^2 + 64).\\n\\nWe need this to equal |m - 1|:\\n(1/2) sqrt(m^2 + 64) = |m - 1|.\\n\\nSquare both sides (both sides are ≥ 0):\\n(1/4)(m^2 + 64) = (m - 1)^2.\\nMultiply by 4:\\nm^2 + 64 = 4(m - 1)^2.\\n\\nExpand the right side:\\n4(m - 1)^2 = 4(m^2 - 2m + 1) = 4m^2 - 8m + 4.\\n\\nSo:\\nm^2 + 64 = 4m^2 - 8m + 4.\\n\\nBring all to one side:\\n0 = 4m^2 - 8m + 4 - (m^2 + 64)\\n= 4m^2 - 8m + 4 - m^2 - 64\\n= 3m^2 - 8m - 60.\\n\\nThus we solve the quadratic:\\n3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0.\\n\\nCompute discriminant:\\nΔ_m = (-8)^2 - 4(3)(-60) = 64 + 720 = 784.\\n\\nsqrt(784) = 28.\\n\\nSo\\nm = [8 ± 28] / (2·3) = [8 ± 28]/6.\\n\\nTwo solutions:\\n1) m = (8 + 28)/6 = 36/6 = 6.\\n2) m = (8 - 28)/6 = -20/6 = -10/3.\\n\\nWe must check each solution satisfies the original absolute-value equation (since squaring can introduce extraneous solutions).\\n\\nCheck m = 6:\\nLeft side |r1 - r2| = (1/2) sqrt(m^2 + 64) = (1/2) sqrt(36 + 64) = (1/2) sqrt(100) = 5.\\nRight side |m - 1| = |6 - 1| = 5.\\nSo m = 6 works.\\n\\nCheck m = -10/3:\\nLeft side:\\n(1/2) sqrt(m^2 + 64) = (1/2) sqrt((100/9) + 64).\\n64 = 576/9,\\nso m^2 + 64 = (100/9) + (576/9) = 676/9.\\nThus sqrt(m^2 + 64) = sqrt(676/9) = 26/3.\\nHence (1/2) sqrt(m^2 + 64) = (1/2)(26/3) = 13/3.\\nRight side:\\n|m - 1| = |-10/3 - 1| = |-10/3 - 3/3| = |-13/3| = 13/3.\\nSo m = -10/3 also works.\\n\\nTherefore the values of m for which the zeros of 2x^2 - m x - 8 differ by |m - k| (with k = 1) are m = 6 and m = -10/3.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6, -10/3\"\n}",
