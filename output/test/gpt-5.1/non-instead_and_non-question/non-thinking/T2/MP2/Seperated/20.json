Compute the remainder when n^3 + 3 is divided by n^2 + 7.\\nWe can write n^3 + 3 = n(n^2 + 7) - 7n + 3.\\nSo n^3 + 3 ≡ -7n + 3 (mod n^2 + 7).\\nFor n^2 + 7 to divide n^3 + 3, we need n^2 + 7 | (-7n + 3).\\nSince n^2 + 7 > 0, this implies | -7n + 3 | ≥ n^2 + 7 unless -7n + 3 = 0, but we must analyze properly using a size argument.\\nObserve that for n ≥ 8, n^2 + 7 > 7n - 3 because:\\n n^2 + 7 - (7n - 3) = n^2 - 7n + 10 = (n - 5)(n - 2).\\nFor n ≥ 8, both factors are ≥ 3, so n^2 - 7n + 10 > 0, hence n^2 + 7 > 7n - 3.\\nThus for n ≥ 8, we have 0 < | -7n + 3 | < n^2 + 7, so the only multiple of n^2 + 7 in that interval is 0, which is impossible (because -7n + 3 = 0 would give n = 3/7, not integer). Hence no solutions for n ≥ 8.\\nSo we only need to check positive integers 1 ≤ n ≤ 7.\\nCompute (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) for each:\\n n = 1: (1 + 3)/(1 + 7) = 4/8 = 1/2 not integer.\\n n = 2: (8 + 3)/(4 + 7) = 11/11 = 1 integer → n = 2 works.\\n n = 3: (27 + 3)/(9 + 7) = 30/16 = 15/8 not integer.\\n n = 4: (64 + 3)/(16 + 7) = 67/23 not integer.\\n n = 5: (125 + 3)/(25 + 7) = 128/32 = 4 integer → n = 5 works.\\n n = 6: (216 + 3)/(36 + 7) = 219/43 not integer.\\n n = 7: (343 + 3)/(49 + 7) = 346/56 = 173/28 not integer.\\nThus the only positive integers n satisfying the condition are n = 2 and n = 5.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nFind m such that the zeros of 2x^2 - m x - 8 differ by m - 1.\\nLet the roots be r1 and r2. For quadratic ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the distance between roots is |r1 - r2| = sqrt(D)/|a|, where D is discriminant.\\nHere a = 2, b = -m, c = -8.\\nDiscriminant D = b^2 - 4ac = (-m)^2 - 4·2·(-8) = m^2 + 64.\\nSo |r1 - r2| = sqrt(m^2 + 64)/|2| = sqrt(m^2 + 64)/2.\\nWe are told this difference equals m - 1. Since a distance is nonnegative, we must have m - 1 ≥ 0 → m ≥ 1, and then we can drop the absolute value and set:\\n sqrt(m^2 + 64)/2 = m - 1.\\nMultiply both sides by 2:\\n sqrt(m^2 + 64) = 2(m - 1).\\nRight side is nonnegative for m ≥ 1, consistent.\\nSquare both sides:\\n m^2 + 64 = 4(m - 1)^2 = 4(m^2 - 2m + 1) = 4m^2 - 8m + 4.\\nRearrange:\\n 0 = 4m^2 - 8m + 4 - (m^2 + 64) = 3m^2 - 8m - 60.\\nSo we solve 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0.\\nCompute discriminant for this quadratic: Δ = (-8)^2 - 4·3·(-60) = 64 + 720 = 784.\\nsqrt(Δ) = sqrt(784) = 28.\\nThen m = [8 ± 28]/(2·3) = (8 ± 28)/6.\\nTwo solutions:\\n m1 = (8 + 28)/6 = 36/6 = 6.\\n m2 = (8 - 28)/6 = -20/6 = -10/3.\\nWe must check which satisfy m ≥ 1 (since we assumed m - 1 ≥ 0 to remove the absolute value).\\n m = 6 ≥ 1, OK.\\n m = -10/3 < 1, violates the assumption.\\nTo check m = -10/3 directly with |r1 - r2| = |m - 1|: distance is sqrt(m^2 + 64)/2 = sqrt((100/9) + 64)/2 = sqrt((100/9) + (576/9))/2 = sqrt(676/9)/2 = (26/3)/2 = 13/3 ≈ 4.33.\\nWhile |m - 1| = |-10/3 - 1| = |-13/3| = 13/3, so it numerically satisfies the equation; however, note that in deriving sqrt(m^2 + 64) = 2(m - 1) we explicitly required m - 1 ≥ 0 to match the principal square root, so m = -10/3 was introduced as an extraneous solution upon squaring? Let’s analyze this more carefully.\\nThe correct starting equation from the problem is |r1 - r2| = |m - 1|, because it only says \\\"differ by m - 1\\\"; we interpret magnitude or signed difference? Usually such problems mean the absolute difference of the roots equals the given amount, so we should set:\\n |r1 - r2| = |m - 1|.\\nWe know |r1 - r2| = sqrt(m^2 + 64)/2 ≥ 0. So the exact equation is:\\n sqrt(m^2 + 64)/2 = |m - 1|.\\nMultiply by 2:\\n sqrt(m^2 + 64) = 2|m - 1|.\\nNow square both sides:\\n m^2 + 64 = 4(m - 1)^2 = 4(m^2 - 2m + 1) = 4m^2 - 8m + 4,\\nso the same quadratic 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0 arises. The squaring step is reversible here because both sides are nonnegative, so all solutions to the quadratic indeed satisfy the original equation with absolute values.\\nThus both m = 6 and m = -10/3 satisfy sqrt(m^2 + 64) = 2|m - 1|, and therefore the roots differ in absolute value by |m - 1|; hence both are valid solutions.\\nDouble-check for m = 6 explicitly:\\n Quadratic: 2x^2 - 6x - 8 = 0 → divide by 2: x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 → roots r1 = 4, r2 = -1. Difference |4 - (-1)| = 5.\\n Here m - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 → matches.\\nFor m = -10/3:\\n Quadratic: 2x^2 + (10/3)x - 8 = 0 → multiply by 3: 6x^2 + 10x - 24 = 0 → simplify by 2: 3x^2 + 5x - 12 = 0.\\nDiscriminant: 5^2 - 4·3·(-12) = 25 + 144 = 169; sqrt = 13.\\nRoots: x = [-5 ± 13]/(2·3) = (-5 ± 13)/6 → r1 = 8/6 = 4/3, r2 = -18/6 = -3.\\nDifference |4/3 - (-3)| = |4/3 + 3| = |4/3 + 9/3| = 13/3.\\nHere m - 1 = -10/3 - 1 = -13/3, and |m - 1| = 13/3. So again the absolute difference of the roots equals |m - 1|, so m = -10/3 is also valid.\\nTherefore, the set of m for which the zeros differ by m - 1 in magnitude is {6, -10/3}.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: n = 2, 5.\\nProblem 2: m = 6 or m = -10/3.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2, 5\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6, -10/3\"\n}",
