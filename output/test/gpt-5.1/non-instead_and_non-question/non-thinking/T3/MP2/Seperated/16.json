Total subsets including empty set: 2^6 = 64, so non-empty subsets: 63.\\nWe must exclude any non-empty subset S that contains at least one (not necessarily proper) subset whose elements sum to 10. Equivalently, we want all non-empty subsets S such that no subset (of S) has sum 10.\\n\\nFirst find all subsets of U whose sum is 10 (these are the \\\"forbidden-sum\\\" subsets that are not allowed to appear as subsets of S):\\nList combinations that sum to 10:\\nSingletons: none (no element equals 10).\\nPairs:\\n1+9 (9 not in U), 2+8 (8 not in U), 3+7 (7 not in U), 4+6=10 (valid), 5+5 (repetition not allowed). So pair {4,6}.\\nTriples:\\n1+2+7 (7 not in U), 1+3+6=10 (valid {1,3,6}), 1+4+5=10 (valid {1,4,5}), 2+3+5=10 (valid {2,3,5}), 2+4+4 (repetition), 3+3+4 (repetition). So triples {1,3,6}, {1,4,5}, {2,3,5}.\\nQuadruples:\\n1+2+3+4=10 (valid {1,2,3,4}). Any other with 5 or 6 already exceeds or duplicates. Larger subsets obviously have sum >10. So the full list of 10-sum subsets is:\\nA = {4,6}, B = {1,3,6}, C = {1,4,5}, D = {2,3,5}, E = {1,2,3,4}.\\n\\nA subset S of U is valid iff it does NOT contain any of A,B,C,D,E as a subset. That is, S must avoid supersets of each of these forbidden subsets. We count the valid subsets using inclusion–exclusion.\\n\\nFor each forbidden subset X, the number of supersets of X (including X itself) contained in U is 2^{6 - |X|} (we freely choose any of the remaining elements to include or not).\\nSizes:\\n|A|=2, |B|=3, |C|=3, |D|=3, |E|=4.\\nSo:\\nSupersets of A: 2^{6-2}=16\\nSupersets of B: 2^{6-3}=8\\nSupersets of C: 8\\nSupersets of D: 8\\nSupersets of E: 2^{6-4}=4\\nSum of single-set counts = 16 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 4 = 44.\\n\\nWe must subtract intersections (common supersets of multiple forbidden subsets). We check all pairwise intersections by taking unions of the forbidden subsets and seeing if the union is still within U and what its size is.\\n\\nCompute unions and sizes:\\nA∪B = {1,3,4,6} (size 4) -> supersets: 2^{6-4} = 4\\nA∪C = {1,4,5,6} (size 4) -> 4 supersets\\nA∪D = {2,3,4,5,6} (size 5) -> 2 supersets\\nA∪E = {1,2,3,4,6} (size 5) -> 2 supersets\\nB∪C = {1,3,4,5,6} (size 5) -> 2 supersets\\nB∪D = {1,2,3,5,6} (size 5) -> 2 supersets\\nB∪E = {1,2,3,4,6} (size 5) -> 2 supersets\\nC∪D = {1,2,3,4,5} (size 5) -> 2 supersets\\nC∪E = {1,2,3,4,5} (size 5) -> 2 supersets\\nD∪E = {1,2,3,4,5} (size 5) -> 2 supersets\\nThere are no disjoint or impossible unions; all remain subsets of U.\\nSum over all 10 pairs: four pairs with count 4 (A∪B, A∪C) and the rest with 2? Let's list the counts clearly:\\nA∪B: 4\\nA∪C: 4\\nA∪D: 2\\nA∪E: 2\\nB∪C: 2\\nB∪D: 2\\nB∪E: 2\\nC∪D: 2\\nC∪E: 2\\nD∪E: 2\\nTotal pair intersection count = 4 + 4 + 2*8 = 8 + 16 = 24.\\n\\nNow triple intersections (supersets containing three forbidden subsets). Intersections correspond to supersets of the union of those three forbidden subsets. Compute unions and sizes; any union that uses all 6 elements has 2^{6-6}=1 superset (the whole U), one that uses 5 elements has 2 supersets, etc.\\nTriples involving A:\\nA∪B∪C = {1,3,4,5,6} (size 5) -> 2\\nA∪B∪D = {1,2,3,4,5,6} (size 6) -> 1\\nA∪B∪E = {1,2,3,4,6} (size 5) -> 2\\nA∪C∪D = {1,2,3,4,5,6} (size 6) -> 1\\nA∪C∪E = {1,2,3,4,5,6} (size 6) -> 1\\nA∪D∪E = {1,2,3,4,5,6} (size 6) -> 1\\nTriples without A:\\nB∪C∪D = {1,2,3,4,5,6} (size 6) -> 1\\nB∪C∪E = {1,2,3,4,5,6} (size 6) -> 1\\nB∪D∪E = {1,2,3,4,5,6} (size 6) -> 1\\nC∪D∪E = {1,2,3,4,5,6} (size 6) -> 1\\nNow sum triple counts: two unions of size 5 giving 2 each (A∪B∪C, A∪B∪E), plus eight unions of size 6 giving 1 each.\\nTotal = 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12.\\n\\nQuadruples (4-set intersections): unions of four forbidden subsets:\\nA∪B∪C∪D: clearly {1,2,3,4,5,6} (size 6) -> 1\\nA∪B∪C∪E: {1,2,3,4,5,6} (size 6) -> 1\\nA∪B∪D∪E: {1,2,3,4,5,6} (size 6) -> 1\\nA∪C∪D∪E: {1,2,3,4,5,6} (size 6) -> 1\\nB∪C∪D∪E: {1,2,3,4,5,6} (size 6) -> 1\\nSo 5 quadruple intersections, each with 1 superset, total 5.\\nQuintuple (all five): A∪B∪C∪D∪E = {1,2,3,4,5,6} (size 6) -> 1.\\n\\nTotal number of subsets containing at least one forbidden-sum subset is:\\nN_bad = (sum singles) − (sum pairs) + (sum triples) − (sum quadruples) + (sum quintuples)\\n= 44 − 24 + 12 − 5 + 1.\\nCompute stepwise: 44 − 24 = 20; 20 + 12 = 32; 32 − 5 = 27; 27 + 1 = 28.\\nSo 28 subsets (including possibly empty? Actually, the empty set can't contain any non-empty subset, so it is not counted among supersets of any forbidden subset; thus all these 28 are non-empty and are included in the 63 non-empty total.)\\nTherefore, valid non-empty subsets count = total non-empty subsets − bad subsets = 63 − 28 = 35.\\nHence answer to Problem 1 is 35.\\n\\nAs a check, we can also consider counting all subsets with no subset summing to 10 by some constructive or case-based reasoning, but inclusion–exclusion is consistent and we carefully accounted for intersections.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe need ordered triples (a,b,c) of nonnegative integers such that\\n(ab + 1)(bc + 1)(ca + 1) = 84.\\nFactor 84: 84 = 2^2 * 3 * 7.\\nLet x = ab+1, y = bc+1, z = ca+1. Then x,y,z are positive integers and xyz=84. Also, a,b,c are nonnegative integers.\\nWe must classify possible triples (x,y,z) as positive integer factorizations of 84 and then see which correspond to integer solutions for (a,b,c) ≥ 0.\\nWe note symmetric nature, but the variables are ordered, so we must count all ordered (a,b,c).\\n\\nWe have relations:\\nab = x−1,\\nbc = y−1,\\nca = z−1.\\nIf any of a,b,c is 0, then the product containing it yields constraint that the corresponding x,y,z must equal 1 (since ab=0 ⇒ ab+1=1, etc.). If none are 0, we can multiply the three equations: (ab)(bc)(ca) = (x−1)(y−1)(z−1).\\nLeft side is a^2 b^2 c^2 = (abc)^2.\\nBut this Diophantine approach might not be necessary; better to case on zeros first, then nonzeros.\\n\\nCase 1: At least one variable is 0.\\nSubcase 1a: Exactly one of a,b,c is 0.\\nWLOG assume a=0. Then ab=0, ca=0, so x=ab+1=1, z=ca+1=1. Only y = bc+1 may be >1.\\nThen xyz = 1 * y * 1 = y = 84, so y=84.\\nThus bc+1 = 84 ⇒ bc = 83.\\n83 is prime (83). The only nonnegative integer factorizations with b,c integers: (b,c) = (1,83) or (83,1). (0,??) would give product 0, not 83; >1 divisors only 1 and 83.\\nSo for a=0, we get 2 solutions.\\nSimilarly, we can have b=0 or c=0 as the single zero variable. Each such choice yields same count.\\n- If b=0: then ab=0 ⇒ x=1, bc=0 ⇒ y=1, so z=84 and ac=83 ⇒ (a,c) = (1,83) or (83,1).\\n- If c=0: similar.\\nSo with exactly one zero variable we get 3 * 2 = 6 solutions.\\n\\nSubcase 1b: Exactly two of a,b,c are 0.\\nSay a=0, b=0, c>0.\\nThen ab=0 ⇒ x=1; bc=0 ⇒ y=1; ca=0 ⇒ z=1.\\nThen xyz = 1, but we need 84. Impossible.\\nSimilarly for other placements. So no solutions.\\n\\nSubcase 1c: All three zero: (0,0,0) gives ab+1=1, bc+1=1, ca+1=1; product 1, not 84. So no solutions.\\nSo total solutions with at least one zero is 6.\\n\\nCase 2: a,b,c are all positive (≥1).\\nThen x=ab+1 ≥2, y≥2, z≥2. So x,y,z are positive divisors of 84, each ≥2, and xyz=84.\\nWe must ensure that x−1, y−1, z−1 can be expressed as pairwise products ab,bc,ca of integers a,b,c ≥1 in a consistent way.\\nWe can try to solve algebraically.\\nFrom ab=x−1, bc=y−1, ca=z−1, multiply all three:\\n(a b)(b c)(c a) = (x−1)(y−1)(z−1) ⇒ (abc)^2 = (x−1)(y−1)(z−1).\\nSo (x−1)(y−1)(z−1) must be a perfect square.\\nAlso, a,b,c positive integers must satisfy consistency conditions. Another derived relation: divide (abc)^2 by e.g. ab = x−1 to get c^2 = (x−1)(y−1)(z−1)/(x−1) = (y−1)(z−1), so c^2=(y−1)(z−1). Similarly b^2=(x−1)(z−1) and a^2=(x−1)(y−1).\\nThat is cleaner: From ab=x−1, bc=y−1, ca=z−1, we can solve:\\nMultiply ab=x−1 and ac=z−1: a^2 b c = (x−1)(z−1), but bc=y−1, so a^2 (y−1) = (x−1)(z−1) ⇒ a^2=(x−1)(z−1)/(y−1). Similarly b^2=(x−1)(y−1)/(z−1), c^2=(y−1)(z−1)/(x−1).\\nHowever, the simpler symmetric relation also shows a^2=(x−1)(y−1)/(z−1) (obtained differently), so let’s be systematic.\\nInstead, do direct algebra:\\nFrom ab=x−1, bc=y−1 ⇒ b^2 c a = (x−1)(y−1) if we multiply both with something; but that gets messy. Use the following trick:\\nab=x−1,\\nbc=y−1,\\nca=z−1.\\nMultiply first two: a b^2 c = (x−1)(y−1). But bc=y−1 ⇒ b c = y−1, so replace bc:\\na b (bc) = a b (y−1) = (x−1)(y−1).\\nCancel (y−1) (nonzero since y≥2): a b = x−1, consistent identity. This does not directly solve for a. So instead divide suitable equations:\\nFrom ab=x−1 and bc=y−1:\\n(ab)/(bc) = (x−1)/(y−1) ⇒ a/c = (x−1)/(y−1).\\nFrom bc=y−1 and ca=z−1:\\n(bc)/(ca) = (y−1)/(z−1) ⇒ b/a = (y−1)/(z−1).\\nFrom ca=z−1 and ab=x−1:\\n(ca)/(ab) = (z−1)/(x−1) ⇒ c/b = (z−1)/(x−1).\\nMultiply a/c and c/b to get a/b:\\n(a/c)*(c/b) = a/b = (x−1)/(y−1) * (z−1)/(x−1) = (z−1)/(y−1).\\nBut we also had b/a = (y−1)/(z−1), consistent.\\nTo find actual a,b,c values, the earlier squared formulas are useful:\\nFrom ab=x−1 and ac=z−1, multiply: a^2 b c = (x−1)(z−1); replace bc by y−1: a^2 (y−1) = (x−1)(z−1). So\\n(1) a^2 = (x−1)(z−1)/(y−1).\\nSimilarly starting with ab=x−1 and bc=y−1:\\nb^2 a c = (x−1)(y−1); replace ac by z−1 ⇒ b^2 (z−1) = (x−1)(y−1) ⇒\\n(2) b^2 = (x−1)(y−1)/(z−1).\\nUsing bc=y−1 and ca=z−1:\\nc^2 a b = (y−1)(z−1); replace ab by x−1 ⇒ c^2 (x−1) = (y−1)(z−1) ⇒\\n(3) c^2 = (y−1)(z−1)/(x−1).\\nThus x,y,z must make these fractions positive integers that are perfect squares.\\nWe can instead brute-force over factorizations of 84 into three factors ≥2 and check.\\n\\nAll positive divisors of 84: 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,14,21,28,42,84.\\nSince x,y,z ≥2 and xyz=84, none can be 1.\\nWe list all ordered triples (x,y,z) of these divisors whose product is 84. It is easier to first list unordered factorizations and then account for permutations, but since the constraints are symmetric in x,y,z, permutations give similar a,b,c up to permutation; however we must still count all distinct ordered (a,b,c) eventually.\\nLet’s enumerate unordered triples {x,y,z} with x≥y≥z≥2 and xyz=84, then for each compute whether some ordering works.\\nFactor 84 = 2^2 * 3 * 7. We partition the prime powers among three factors ≥2.\\nSystematic enumeration:\\nStart with z minimal value 2 and build.\\nUse direct integer factorizations:\\nTake z=2:\\nThen x*y = 42. Factor pairs for 42 with y≥z=2:\\n(21,2),(14,3),(7,6). So unordered triples: {21,2,2}, {14,3,2}, {7,6,2}.\\nCheck that we don't miss pairs: divisors of 42: 1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42. Pair with ≥2: (2,21), (3,14), (6,7). Good.\\nTake z=3:\\nThen x*y = 28. Pairs with y≥3: (14,2) (here y=2<3 so discard ordering), (7,4), (28,1). Using sorted y≥z=3, the possibilities: (7,4). So triple {7,4,3}.\\nTake z=4:\\nThen x*y = 21. Pairs with y≥4: divisors: (7,3) but y=3<4; (21,1). So none.\\nTake z=6:\\nThen x*y = 14. Pairs divisors: (7,2),(14,1). With y≥6: none.\\nTake z=7:\\nThen x*y = 12. Pairs: (6,2),(4,3),(12,1). With y≥7: none.\\nLarger z gives product < required for both ≥z.\\nSo unordered triples (ignoring order) are:\\nT1: {21,2,2}\\nT2: {14,3,2}\\nT3: {7,6,2}\\nT4: {7,4,3}.\\n\\nNow for each such triple we consider all ordered permutations (x,y,z) and check whether we get integer a,b,c≥1 via the system ab = x−1, bc = y−1, ca = z−1.\\nBecause the system is symmetric in a,b,c, permuting (x,y,z) might correspond to permuting (a,b,c) or possibly no solution.\\nFor each candidate (x,y,z), compute (x−1,y−1,z−1) and see if there exist integers a,b,c with ab=x−1, bc=y−1, ca=z−1.\\nWe can use the previous squared formulas, but a more direct check uses ratios:\\nRecap:\\n(1) a/c = (x−1)/(y−1)\\n(2) b/a = (y−1)/(z−1)\\n(3) c/b = (z−1)/(x−1)\\nNote that multiplying these three gives 1, consistent.\\nGiven x,y,z, we can pick say a from the formula derived earlier: a^2 = (x−1)(z−1)/(y−1). Similarly for b,c. So integer squares condition is necessary and sufficient.\\n\\nWe handle each unordered triple case by case.\\n\\nCase T1: multiset {21,2,2}.\\nThen numbers are 21,2,2. So possible ordered triples (x,y,z) are permutations:\\n(21,2,2), (2,21,2), (2,2,21). There are 3 distinct permutations since two entries equal.\\nCompute for each.\\n1) (x,y,z)=(21,2,2).\\nThen x−1=20, y−1=1, z−1=1.\\nCompute a^2 = (x−1)(z−1)/(y−1) = 20*1/1 = 20, not a perfect square.\\nSo no integer a.\\nAlternatively: because y−1=1, we also have bc=1 and the others give ab=20, ca=1. But integer positive b,c such that bc=1 implies b=c=1. Then ab= a*1=20 ⇒ a=20, but ca=c*a=1*20=20, whereas we need ca=1. Contradiction. So no solution.\\n2) (x,y,z)=(2,21,2).\\nThen x−1=1, y−1=20, z−1=1.\\nThen ab=1, bc=20, ca=1.\\nFrom ab=1 ⇒ a=b=1. Then ca=c*1=1 ⇒ c=1. But then bc=1, not 20. No solution.\\n3) (x,y,z)=(2,2,21).\\nThen x−1=1, y−1=1, z−1=20.\\nab=1 ⇒ a=b=1. bc=1 ⇒ b=c=1. Then ca=1, but needs 20. No solution.\\nSo T1 yields no positive solutions.\\n\\nCase T2: {14,3,2}.\\nPossible permutations: (14,3,2), (14,2,3), (3,14,2), (3,2,14), (2,14,3), (2,3,14).\\nCompute x−1,y−1,z−1 in each.\\n1) (14,3,2): x−1=13, y−1=2, z−1=1.\\nEquations: ab=13, bc=2, ca=1.\\nFrom ca=1 ⇒ (c,a)=(1,1). Then ab=13 ⇒ b=13, but bc=13*c=13*1=13, not 2. No.\\n2) (14,2,3): x−1=13, y−1=1, z−1=2.\\nab=13, bc=1, ca=2.\\nbc=1 ⇒ b=c=1. Then ab=13 ⇒ a=13. Then ca=c a=1*13=13, but must be 2. No.\\n3) (3,14,2): x−1=2, y−1=13, z−1=1.\\nab=2, bc=13, ca=1.\\nca=1 ⇒ (c,a)=(1,1). Then ab=2 ⇒ b=2, but bc=2*1=2, not 13. No.\\n4) (3,2,14): x−1=2, y−1=1, z−1=13.\\nab=2, bc=1, ca=13.\\nbc=1 ⇒ b=c=1. Then ab=2 ⇒ a=2. Then ca=c a=1*2=2, not 13. No.\\n5) (2,14,3): x−1=1, y−1=13, z−1=2.\\nab=1 ⇒ a=b=1. Then bc=13 ⇒ c=13. Then ca=1*13=13, but need 2. No.\\n6) (2,3,14): x−1=1, y−1=2, z−1=13.\\nab=1 ⇒ a=b=1. Then bc=2 ⇒ c=2. Then ca=2, not 13. No.\\nSo T2 yields no positive solutions.\\n\\nCase T3: {7,6,2}.\\nPermutations: (7,6,2), (7,2,6), (6,7,2), (6,2,7), (2,7,6), (2,6,7).\\nCompute.\\n1) (7,6,2): x−1=6, y−1=5, z−1=1.\\nab=6, bc=5, ca=1.\\nca=1 ⇒ (c,a)=(1,1). Then ab=6 ⇒ b=6. Then bc=6*1=6, not 5. No.\\n2) (7,2,6): x−1=6, y−1=1, z−1=5.\\nab=6, bc=1, ca=5.\\nbc=1 ⇒ b=c=1. Then ab=6 ⇒ a=6. Then ca=6*1=6, not 5. No.\\n3) (6,7,2): x−1=5, y−1=6, z−1=1.\\nab=5, bc=6, ca=1.\\nca=1 ⇒ (c,a)=(1,1). Then ab=5 ⇒ b=5. Then bc=5*1=5, not 6. No.\\n4) (6,2,7): x−1=5, y−1=1, z−1=6.\\nab=5, bc=1, ca=6.\\nbc=1 ⇒ b=c=1. Then ab=5 ⇒ a=5. Then ca=5*1=5, not 6. No.\\n5) (2,7,6): x−1=1, y−1=6, z−1=5.\\nab=1 ⇒ a=b=1. Then bc=6 ⇒ c=6. Then ca=6*1=6, not 5. No.\\n6) (2,6,7): x−1=1, y−1=5, z−1=6.\\nab=1 ⇒ a=b=1. Then bc=5 ⇒ c=5. Then ca=5*1=5, not 6. No.\\nSo T3 yields no positive solutions.\\n\\nCase T4: {7,4,3}.\\nPermutations: (7,4,3), (7,3,4), (4,7,3), (4,3,7), (3,7,4), (3,4,7).\\nCompute each.\\n1) (7,4,3): x−1=6, y−1=3, z−1=2.\\nab=6, bc=3, ca=2.\\nWe can solve systematically. From ab=6 and bc=3: multiply: a b^2 c = 18. But bc=3 ⇒ b c=3 ⇒ substitute: a*b*(3)=18 ⇒ 3ab=18 ⇒ ab=6 (consistent). Let's directly solve by looking for integer triple (a,b,c) with these pairwise products.\\nFrom ab=6: possible positive integer pairs (a,b): (1,6),(2,3),(3,2),(6,1).\\nFor each, we can derive c from bc=3 or ca=2 and check consistency.\\n- (a,b)=(1,6): then bc=3 ⇒ 6c=3 ⇒ c=1/2 not integer.\\n- (a,b)=(2,3): bc=3 ⇒ 3c=3 ⇒ c=1. Then ca=2 ⇒ c*a=1*2=2, satisfied. So (2,3,1) works.\\n- (a,b)=(3,2): bc=3 ⇒ 2c=3 ⇒ c=3/2 not integer.\\n- (a,b)=(6,1): bc=3 ⇒ 1*c=3 ⇒ c=3. Then ca=2 ⇒ c*a=3*6=18, not 2.\\nSo from x,y,z = (7,4,3) we get one solution: (a,b,c)=(2,3,1).\\nCheck original equation: ab+1=2*3+1=7, bc+1=3*1+1=4, ca+1=1*2+1=3 ⇒ product 7*4*3=84 correct.\\n2) (7,3,4): x−1=6, y−1=2, z−1=3.\\nab=6, bc=2, ca=3.\\nAgain, ab=6 pairs as above.\\n- (a,b)=(1,6): bc=2 ⇒ 6c=2 ⇒ c=1/3 not integer.\\n- (a,b)=(2,3): bc=2 ⇒ 3c=2 ⇒ c=2/3 no.\\n- (a,b)=(3,2): bc=2 ⇒ 2c=2 ⇒ c=1. Then ca=3 ⇒ c*a=1*3=3 satisfied. So (3,2,1) works.\\n- (a,b)=(6,1): bc=2 ⇒ c=2, then ca=3 ⇒ 2*6=12≠3.\\nSo one solution: (3,2,1).\\n3) (4,7,3): x−1=3, y−1=6, z−1=2.\\nab=3, bc=6, ca=2.\\nab=3 ⇒ pairs (1,3),(3,1).\\n- (a,b)=(1,3): bc=6 ⇒ 3c=6 ⇒ c=2. Then ca=2 ⇒ 2*1=2 satisfied. So (1,3,2) works.\\n- (a,b)=(3,1): bc=6 ⇒ 1*c=6 ⇒ c=6. Then ca=2 ⇒ 6*3=18≠2.\\nSo one solution: (1,3,2).\\n4) (4,3,7): x−1=3, y−1=2, z−1=6.\\nab=3, bc=2, ca=6.\\nab=3 ⇒ (a,b)=(1,3),(3,1).\\n- (1,3): bc=2 ⇒ 3c=2 ⇒ c not integer.\\n- (3,1): bc=2 ⇒ c=2, then ca=6 ⇒ 2*3=6 satisfied. So (3,1,2) works.\\nSo one solution: (3,1,2).\\n5) (3,7,4): x−1=2, y−1=6, z−1=3.\\nab=2, bc=6, ca=3.\\nab=2 ⇒ pairs (1,2),(2,1).\\n- (1,2): bc=6 ⇒ 2c=6 ⇒ c=3. Then ca=3 ⇒ 3*1=3 satisfied. So (1,2,3) works.\\n- (2,1): bc=6 ⇒ c=6, ca=3 ⇒ 6*2=12≠3.\\nSo one solution: (1,2,3).\\n6) (3,4,7): x−1=2, y−1=3, z−1=6.\\nab=2, bc=3, ca=6.\\nab=2 ⇒ (1,2),(2,1).\\n- (1,2): bc=3 ⇒ 2c=3 no.\\n- (2,1): bc=3 ⇒ c=3. Then ca=6 ⇒ 3*2=6 satisfied. So (2,1,3) works.\\nSo from T4 we obtain 6 positive integer solutions:\\n(2,3,1), (3,2,1), (1,3,2), (3,1,2), (1,2,3), (2,1,3).\\nThose are exactly all permutations of (1,2,3). Indeed, the solutions are all ordered triples which are permutations of 1,2,3 with all entries positive.\\n\\nThus all solutions with a,b,c positive are exactly the 3! = 6 permutations of (1,2,3).\\n\\nTotal solutions combining cases:\\n- With at least one zero, we found 6 solutions: of the type exactly one coordinate zero, the other two (1,83) or (83,1) arranged consistently.\\n- With all positive, 6 solutions: permutations of (1,2,3).\\nSo grand total: 6 + 6 = 12.\\n\\nWe should list the 6 solutions with a zero explicitly to ensure no overlap with the positive ones (they obviously don't overlap) and to confirm count.\\nFor a=0 case:\\n(a,b,c) = (0,1,83), (0,83,1).\\nFor b=0 case:\\n(a,b,c) = (1,0,83), (83,0,1).\\nFor c=0 case:\\n(a,b,c) = (1,83,0), (83,1,0).\\nThat’s 6 distinct ordered triples.\\nPlus the 6 permutations of (1,2,3):\\n(1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), (3,2,1).\\nTotal 12.\\n\\nSo final answers:\\nProblem 1: 35\\nProblem 2: 12.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"35\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
