In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nThere are 8 antigens. Each student corresponds to a distinct subset of the 8, so there are exactly 2^8 = 256 students, one per subset. Quito chooses a random subset of students and a random order on that chosen subset.\\nWe can equivalently imagine that Quito chooses a random permutation of all 256 students (a random order) and then an independent random stopping rule that selects an initial segment, because for expectation of suffering we only need that, for any pair of bitten students A then B, the probability that A is bitten before B is 1/2.\\n\\nFocus on a fixed student S with antigen set A. When Quito bites S, his current carried antigen set is the union of antigens from all previously bitten students. For any antigen x, S suffers 1 hour from x if and only if Quito carries x at that time and S does not have x.\\nLet the 8 antigens be labeled 1,...,8. By linearity over antigens and students, total expected suffering is sum over all ordered pairs (student, antigen) of the probability that this pair contributes 1 hour.\\n\\nFix an antigen i. Consider only the students lacking antigen i; call them type-0 for i. Any such student S will suffer 1 hour from i exactly if some previously bitten student has antigen i. Among the 256 subsets, exactly half (2^7 = 128) contain antigen i, half do not. So 128 students have i, 128 do not.\\nConsider the combined population of those 128 with i and one particular student S without i. In a random ordering of all 256 students, the event that at least one student with i appears before S is equivalent to \\\"S is not the earliest among these 129 special students (S plus the 128 with i).\\\" Among these 129, all orders are symmetric, so the probability that S is earliest is 1/129. Hence the probability that someone with i appears before S is 1 - 1/129 = 128/129.\\nTherefore, for a fixed antigen i and a fixed student S lacking i, the expected contribution from i to S’s suffering is 128/129 hours.\\nThere are 128 students lacking i for each i. Thus total expected suffering from antigen i over all students is 128 * (128/129) = 16384/129.\\nThere are 8 antigens, all symmetric, so total expected suffering over all students from all antigens is 8 * 16384/129 = 131072/129.\\nSo the expected total suffering is 131072/129 hours.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nLet the three integers be a, b, c. Alex’s operation is: choose two numbers, average them, and add to the remaining one. The three possible outcomes are:\\n1) Using a,b then adding to c: (a + b)/2 + c\\n2) Using a,c then adding to b: (a + c)/2 + b\\n3) Using b,c then adding to a: (b + c)/2 + a\\nWe are told that the set of possible results is {42, 13, 37}.\\nDefine:\\nX = (a + b)/2 + c\\nY = (a + c)/2 + b\\nZ = (b + c)/2 + a\\nWe know {X, Y, Z} = {42, 13, 37}. First, compute X + Y + Z in terms of a, b, c:\\nX + Y + Z = ((a + b)/2 + c) + ((a + c)/2 + b) + ((b + c)/2 + a)\\nGroup average terms: (a + b)/2 + (a + c)/2 + (b + c)/2 = (2a + 2b + 2c)/2 = a + b + c.\\nAdd the standalone terms a + b + c to get total X + Y + Z = 2(a + b + c).\\nFrom the values, X + Y + Z = 42 + 13 + 37 = 92, so 2(a + b + c) = 92, giving a + b + c = 46.\\nNow compute pairwise sums, e.g. X + Y:\\nX + Y = (a + b)/2 + c + (a + c)/2 + b = (a + b + a + c)/2 + b + c = (2a + b + c)/2 + b + c\\n= (2a + b + c + 2b + 2c)/2 = (2a + 3b + 3c)/2.\\nBut an easier way: X + Y + Z - Z = X + Y. Since X + Y + Z = 92, we have X + Y = 92 - Z.\\nOn the other hand, X + Y in terms of a,b,c can also be expressed as:\\nX + Y = 2(a + b + c) - Z = 92 - Z (consistent with the above), and similarly for other pairs.\\nIt is more direct to solve the system using the identity for each outcome.\\nWe know:\\nX = (a + b)/2 + c = 42 or 13 or 37,\\nY = (a + c)/2 + b = one of the remaining,\\nZ = (b + c)/2 + a = the last.\\nAlso we know a + b + c = 46.\\nExpress X in terms of total sum. Note a + b = (a + b + c) - c = 46 - c.\\nSo X = (46 - c)/2 + c = 23 - c/2 + c = 23 + c/2.\\nThus X = 23 + c/2.\\nSince X ∈ {42, 13, 37}, we solve for c from each possibility:\\nIf X = 42: 23 + c/2 = 42 → c/2 = 19 → c = 38.\\nIf X = 13: 23 + c/2 = 13 → c/2 = -10 → c = -20.\\nIf X = 37: 23 + c/2 = 37 → c/2 = 14 → c = 28.\\nSo depending on which result corresponds to X, c is 38, -20, or 28.\\nSimilarly, express Y in terms of b: a + c = (a + b + c) - b = 46 - b, so\\nY = (46 - b)/2 + b = 23 + b/2.\\nThus possible b values from Y ∈ {42, 13, 37} are:\\n23 + b/2 = 42 → b = 38,\\n23 + b/2 = 13 → b = -20,\\n23 + b/2 = 37 → b = 28.\\nAnd for Z:\\na + b = 46 - c but more symmetric is: b + c = (a + b + c) - a = 46 - a so\\nZ = (46 - a)/2 + a = 23 + a/2.\\nThus possible a values from Z ∈ {42, 13, 37} are:\\n23 + a/2 = 42 → a = 38,\\n23 + a/2 = 13 → a = -20,\\n23 + a/2 = 37 → a = 28.\\nTherefore, each of a, b, c must be in {38, -20, 28}. Since their sum is 46, check combinations. If we take a, b, c as a permutation of (38, 28, -20): 38 + 28 - 20 = 46, which works.\\nNow verify that the outcomes are indeed {42, 13, 37}. Take (a, b, c) = (38, 28, -20):\\nX = (a + b)/2 + c = (38 + 28)/2 - 20 = 66/2 - 20 = 33 - 20 = 13.\\nY = (a + c)/2 + b = (38 - 20)/2 + 28 = 18/2 + 28 = 9 + 28 = 37.\\nZ = (b + c)/2 + a = (28 - 20)/2 + 38 = 8/2 + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42.\\nSo the possible final results are indeed 13, 37, 42. Thus James’s integers are 38, 28, and -20 (in any order).\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"131072/129\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"38, 28, -20\"\n}",
