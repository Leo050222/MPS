Then n = s(s - 1) + 1.\\nWe also know that for any positive integer n with d digits, 10^{d-1} <= n <= 10^d - 1 and S(n) <= 9d.\\nWe need consistency between the decimal representation and the digit sum.\\n\\nFirst, note that s >= 1. If s = 1, then n = 1(0) + 1 = 1. Check: S(1) = 1, and 1·0 = 0, n - 1 = 0, works. So n = 1 is a solution.\\nAssume s >= 2. Then n = s^2 - s + 1.\\nWe must have S(s^2 - s + 1) = s.\\nLet us bound the number of digits. For typical values, s is much smaller than n, so n must not be too large compared to s.\\n\\nWe can use a crude inequality: S(n) <= 9 * number_of_digits(n). Also number_of_digits(n) ≈ floor(log10 n) + 1.\\nFor large s, n grows on order s^2, while S(n) at most grows linearly in log n. That suggests only small s are possible.\\nWe can systematically test small s by reasoning.\\n\\nCompute n(s) = s^2 - s + 1 and S(n):\\n- s = 2: n = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3, S(3) = 3 ≠ 2 → no\\n- s = 3: n = 9 - 3 + 1 = 7, S(7) = 7 ≠ 3 → no\\n- s = 4: n = 16 - 4 + 1 = 13, S(13) = 1 + 3 = 4, equals s → works, so n = 13\\n- s = 5: n = 25 - 5 + 1 = 21, S(21) = 2 + 1 = 3 ≠ 5 → no\\n- s = 6: n = 36 - 6 + 1 = 31, S(31) = 3 + 1 = 4 ≠ 6 → no\\n- s = 7: n = 49 - 7 + 1 = 43, S(43) = 4 + 3 = 7 → works, so n = 43\\n- s = 8: n = 64 - 8 + 1 = 57, S(57) = 5 + 7 = 12 ≠ 8\\n- s = 9: n = 81 - 9 + 1 = 73, S(73) = 7 + 3 = 10 ≠ 9\\n- s = 10: n = 100 - 10 + 1 = 91, S(91) = 9 + 1 = 10 → works, so n = 91\\n- s = 11: n = 121 - 11 + 1 = 111, S(111) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 ≠ 11\\n- s = 12: n = 144 - 12 + 1 = 133, S(133) = 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 ≠ 12\\n- s = 13: n = 169 - 13 + 1 = 157, S(157) = 1 + 5 + 7 = 13 → works, so n = 157\\n- s = 14: n = 196 - 14 + 1 = 183, S(183) = 1 + 8 + 3 = 12 ≠ 14\\n- s = 15: n = 225 - 15 + 1 = 211, S(211) = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 ≠ 15\\n- s = 16: n = 256 - 16 + 1 = 241, S(241) = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 ≠ 16\\n- s = 17: n = 289 - 17 + 1 = 273, S(273) = 2 + 7 + 3 = 12 ≠ 17\\n- s = 18: n = 324 - 18 + 1 = 307, S(307) = 3 + 0 + 7 = 10 ≠ 18\\n\\nWe suspect only finitely many solutions. To be sure, we can derive a contradiction for large s.\\nFor s >= 10, n has at least two digits. More precisely, for s >= 10, n = s^2 - s + 1 >= 91 and roughly grows quadratically. Then the number of digits d satisfies 10^{d-1} <= n < 10^d, so d ≈ floor(log10 n) + 1.\\nWe have s = S(n) <= 9d. So s <= 9d and n ≈ s^2 implies d is at least around 2 * log10 s.\\nSo s <= 9(2 log10 s + 1) for large s, while n ~ s^2. But s grows faster than log s; thus beyond some moderate s, the inequality cannot hold.\\nA practical bound: for s >= 20, d = number of digits of n is at most 4 or 5 when n is in the hundreds or thousands. Let's check more concretely.\\nFor s >= 20, n = s^2 - s + 1 ≥ 20^2 - 20 + 1 = 381. For s up to 99 (the largest possible sum of digits for a 2-digit or 3-digit n is limited), n < 99^2 = 9801, so n has at most 4 digits. Hence S(n) <= 9 * 4 = 36.\\nThus for s >= 37, we get S(n) <= 36 < s, impossible. So s <= 36.\\nWe have checked up to s = 18. We must check s = 19 to 36.\\nContinue:\\n- s = 19: n = 19^2 - 19 + 1 = 361 - 19 + 1 = 343, S(343) = 3 + 4 + 3 = 10 ≠ 19\\n- s = 20: n = 400 - 20 + 1 = 381, S(381) = 3 + 8 + 1 = 12 ≠ 20\\n- s = 21: n = 441 - 21 + 1 = 421, S(421) = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 ≠ 21\\n- s = 22: n = 484 - 22 + 1 = 463, S(463) = 4 + 6 + 3 = 13 ≠ 22\\n- s = 23: n = 529 - 23 + 1 = 507, S(507) = 5 + 0 + 7 = 12 ≠ 23\\n- s = 24: n = 576 - 24 + 1 = 553, S(553) = 5 + 5 + 3 = 13 ≠ 24\\n- s = 25: n = 625 - 25 + 1 = 601, S(601) = 6 + 0 + 1 = 7 ≠ 25\\n- s = 26: n = 676 - 26 + 1 = 651, S(651) = 6 + 5 + 1 = 12 ≠ 26\\n- s = 27: n = 729 - 27 + 1 = 703, S(703) = 7 + 0 + 3 = 10 ≠ 27\\n- s = 28: n = 784 - 28 + 1 = 757, S(757) = 7 + 5 + 7 = 19 ≠ 28\\n- s = 29: n = 841 - 29 + 1 = 813, S(813) = 8 + 1 + 3 = 12 ≠ 29\\n- s = 30: n = 900 - 30 + 1 = 871, S(871) = 8 + 7 + 1 = 16 ≠ 30\\n- s = 31: n = 961 - 31 + 1 = 931, S(931) = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13 ≠ 31\\n- s = 32: n = 1024 - 32 + 1 = 993, S(993) = 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 ≠ 32\\n- s = 33: n = 1089 - 33 + 1 = 1057, S(1057) = 1 + 0 + 5 + 7 = 13 ≠ 33\\n- s = 34: n = 1156 - 34 + 1 = 1123, S(1123) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7 ≠ 34\\n- s = 35: n = 1225 - 35 + 1 = 1191, S(1191) = 1 + 1 + 9 + 1 = 12 ≠ 35\\n- s = 36: n = 1296 - 36 + 1 = 1261, S(1261) = 1 + 2 + 6 + 1 = 10 ≠ 36\\nThus no more solutions.\\nInclude the s = 1 solution n = 1.\\nSo all n are: 1, 13, 43, 91, 157.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have a unit cube. Penta picks 5 of its 8 vertices. Consider the convex hull of the chosen points; we want to maximize its volume. The cube has volume 1.\\nIntuitively, the maximal volume will occur when the chosen 5 vertices form a polyhedron that occupies as much of the cube as possible and is still convex with those vertices.\\nThe convex hull of any 5 vertices of a cube is a polytope with at most 5 vertices. However, its volume cannot exceed the cube's volume, and certain symmetric configurations are known to give typical volumes like 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, etc.\\nWe must find the optimal choice of 5 vertices.\\nBecause of cube symmetry, we can classify subsets of 5 vertices up to isometries of the cube. Instead of enumerating all C(8,5) = 56 choices, we group them into types.\\nRepresent cube vertices as (0 or 1, 0 or 1, 0 or 1). The symmetry group allows us to assume one fixed vertex is always included, say (0,0,0). But careful: the max configuration might not include this vertex by symmetry, but by symmetry we can always move any chosen set of vertices so that some chosen vertex is mapped to (0,0,0).\\nThe types of 5-vertex subsets (up to symmetry) are known from combinatorial geometry, but we can reason directly.\\nFirst, consider the complement: we omit 3 vertices (since 8 - 5 = 3). Different ways to omit 3 vertices likely yield different volumes. By symmetry, classify 3-vertex subsets of cube vertices; their complements give the 5-vertex sets.\\nTypes of 3-vertex subsets:\\n1) Three vertices that form a face corner path (like an L-shape) but not collinear, not forming a face diagonal and one adjacent.\\n2) Three vertices forming a right triangle lying entirely on one face (i.e., one face's three corners).\\n3) Three vertices forming a diagonal on one face plus another outside that face.\\n4) Three mutually non-adjacent vertices, e.g., forming a triangle crossing space.\\nInstead of an exhaustive classification, note a better approach: Any 5-vertex subset's convex hull is a subset of the cube. The complement of its convex hull might be union of up to three tetrahedra.\\nA common strategy: WLOG include vertex O=(0,0,0). Consider which three vertices are excluded; each excluded vertex may carve out some tetrahedral region from the cube.\\nBut an even simpler approach: many sources know that the maximal volume polyhedron obtainable as convex hull of 5 vertices of a cube is 5/6 of the cube; let's verify by actual coordinates.\\nWe try a concrete configuration and compute volume.\\nConsider omitting three vertices that share one coordinate, leaving a \\\"pentagonal\\\" pyramid-like shape. Try: choose the 5 vertices\\nA = (0,0,0)\\nB = (1,0,0)\\nC = (0,1,0)\\nD = (0,0,1)\\nE = (1,1,1)\\nSo we omit (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1).\\nCompute convex hull volume.\\nWe can partition the cube into tetrahedra and check which remain.\\nAlternatively, compute volume of hull directly via decomposing into tetrahedra forming a triangulation from one vertex.\\nTake O = A = (0,0,0) as a common vertex and triangulate the hull into tetrahedra O-B-C-E, O-C-D-E, O-D-B-E maybe; confirm that these cover hull without overlap and lie within cube.\\nCheck whether all 5 vertices are part of these tetrahedra and that their union is convex hull.\\nWe can check coordinates: The four points O,B,C,E form a tetrahedron with volume |det(B-O, C-O, E-O)|/6.\\nVectors:\\nB-O = (1,0,0)\\nC-O = (0,1,0)\\nE-O = (1,1,1)\\nMatrix with columns:\\n[1 0 1]\\n[0 1 1]\\n[0 0 1]\\nDeterminant = 1*(1*1 - 1*0) - 0 + 1*(0*0 - 1*0) = 1.\\nVolume T1 = 1/6.\\nNext T2: O,C,D,E.\\nC-O = (0,1,0)\\nD-O = (0,0,1)\\nE-O = (1,1,1)\\nMatrix:\\n[0 0 1]\\n[1 0 1]\\n[0 1 1]\\nCompute det:\\n= 0*det[[0,1],[1,1]] - 0*det[[1,1],[0,1]] + 1*det[[1,0],[0,1]] = 1.\\nVolume T2 = 1/6.\\nT3: O,D,B,E.\\nD-O = (0,0,1)\\nB-O = (1,0,0)\\nE-O = (1,1,1)\\nMatrix:\\n[0 1 1]\\n[0 0 1]\\n[1 0 1]\\ndet = 0*det[[0,1],[0,1]] -1*det[[0,1],[1,1]] +1*det[[0,0],[1,0]]\\n= - (0*1 -1*1) + (0*0 -0*1)\\n= -(-1) + 0 = 1.\\nVolume T3 = 1/6.\\nTotal volume sum = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/2.\\nSo this configuration yields volume 1/2, not maximal.\\nTry a different configuration.\\nPerhaps we should choose 5 vertices that include a whole face (4 vertices) plus one more vertex far away.\\nCase: choose the face z=0: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,0) and add (1,1,1).\\nVertices: A = (0,0,0), B = (1,0,0), C = (1,1,0), D = (0,1,0), E = (1,1,1).\\nThe convex hull is a pyramid with square base ABCD and apex E? Not exactly, since E is above C but also above the square; yes, E is off the plane z=0, so we get a pyramid with base ABCD and apex E.\\nVolume of a pyramid = (1/3) * base area * height. Base ABCD is a unit square (area 1). Height is perpendicular distance from E to plane z=0, which is 1. So volume = 1/3. That is smaller.\\nTry 4 vertices that form a tetrahedron of volume 1/3 (like half cube) plus one extra vertex that enlarges hull.\\nA regular cube can be partitioned into 6 congruent tetrahedra of volume 1/6 each or into 5 tetrahedra of volume 1/6 plus one of 1/3; but we know the standard large tetrahedron formed by (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) has volume 1/6.\\nBut some four vertices of the cube form a tetrahedron with volume 1/3 (a \\\"big\\\" tetrahedron); in a unit cube, the max volume of a tetrahedron with vertices at cube vertices is 1/3 (one known example: (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1)). Let's verify volume:\\nVectors: v1=(1,1,0), v2=(1,0,1), v3=(0,1,1). The determinant magnitude: det[[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1]] = 1*(0*1-1*1) - 1*(1*1-0*0) + 0*(1*1-0*0) = 1*( -1 ) -1*(1) +0 = -2, abs = 2. Volume = |det|/6 = 2/6 = 1/3.\\nSo we consider such a big tetrahedron plus an extra vertex.\\nLet us take T big with vertices:\\nA = (0,0,0)\\nB = (1,1,0)\\nC = (1,0,1)\\nD = (0,1,1)\\nVolume(T) = 1/3.\\nWhich 5th vertex to choose to maximize hull volume? Consider adding a vertex not in T; candidates: remaining 4 vertices of cube: (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,1).\\nThe convex hull of T plus the new vertex likely increases volume, cutting off some region from cube.\\nLet's try adding E=(1,1,1), the farthest corner from A.\\nWe then have a polytope with vertices A,B,C,D,E.\\nPerhaps its volume equals cube volume 1 minus volume of three small corner tetrahedra at the omitted vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1).\\nCheck which vertices are omitted: we include A=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1), E=(1,1,1). So omitted are:\\nP = (1,0,0)\\nQ = (0,1,0)\\nR = (0,0,1).\\nConjecture: the convex hull of A,B,C,D,E is the cube minus three congruent corner tetrahedra at P,Q,R each of volume 1/6, giving volume 1 - 3*(1/6) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\\nBut we need to verify shape.\\nThe cube's eight vertices are A,P,Q,B,R,C,D,E arranged in the cube. The polytope including A,B,C,D,E might indeed remove three regions near P,Q,R. Let's check one such region near P = (1,0,0).\\nIs P inside convex hull of A,B,C,E,C,D? Actually P is adjacent to A,B,C, so faces containing P might be replaced by faces A-C-B, etc.\\nBetter approach: compute volume directly by partitioning the cube.\\nWe can describe the convex hull H of A,B,C,D,E in inequalities form and integrate, but that is overkill.\\nInstead, realize that points P,Q,R lie on faces that get \\\"cut off\\\" when we connect E to B,C,D. Compare with the convex hull of the five points: The face B-C-D is not coplanar; we need explicit facets.\\nAlternative: compute H-volume via triangulation from A. But A is at a corner; E is opposite. Likely hull decomposes into several tetrahedra.\\nLet's attempt triangulation of H using vertex A as base where possible.\\nNote: B,C,D,E all are away from A. The set of vertices A,B,C,D,E might decompose into tetrahedra: A-B-C-E, A-C-D-E, A-D-B-E? However, D,B,E are not necessarily forming a face; we must ensure tetrahedra union equals H and stays inside cube.\\nCompute volumes of tetrahedra A-B-C-E, A-C-D-E, A-D-B-E with determinants to see total.\\nFirst T1: A,B,C,E.\\nVectors from A:\\nB = (1,1,0)\\nC = (1,0,1)\\nE = (1,1,1)\\nMatrix columns:\\n[1 1 1]\\n[1 0 1]\\n[0 1 1]\\nDeterminant = 1*(0*1 - 1*1) -1*(1*1 - 0*1) +1*(1*1 - 0*0)\\n= 1*(-1) -1*(1) +1*(1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1. abs = 1, so volume = 1/6.\\nT2: A,C,D,E.\\nC=(1,0,1)\\nD=(0,1,1)\\nE=(1,1,1)\\nMatrix:\\n[1 0 1]\\n[0 1 1]\\n[1 1 1]\\nDet = 1*(1*1 - 1*1) -0*(0*1 -1*1) +1*(0*1 -1*1)\\n= 1*(0) -0*something +1*(0 -1) = -1. abs=1, volume=1/6.\\nT3: A,D,B,E.\\nD=(0,1,1)\\nB=(1,1,0)\\nE=(1,1,1)\\nMatrix:\\n[0 1 1]\\n[1 1 1]\\n[1 0 1]\\nCompute det:\\n= 0*det[[1,1],[0,1]] -1*det[[1,1],[1,1]] +1*det[[1,1],[1,0]]\\n= -1*(1*1 -1*1) +1*(1*0 -1*1)\\n= -(0) + (0-1) = -1. abs=1, volume=1/6.\\nTotal of these three tetrahedra = 3*(1/6) = 1/2.\\nAgain we get 1/2. So that configuration also gives volume 1/2.\\nSo far max is 1/2.\\nWe must consider other inequivalent subsets; but known results suggest 1/2 is actually maximal.\\nTo be more confident, consider that removing 3 vertices corresponds to cutting off up to 3 disjoint corner tetrahedra from the cube. The minimal total removed volume seems at least 1/2, because each corner cut from omitting a vertex in all-convex hulls would be 1/6 or more.\\nMore systematically: Any subset S of vertices defines a convex hull K. Its complement in cube is union of certain convex polytopes near omitted vertices, typically tetrahedra or wedges. The smallest possible complement volume arises when omitted vertices are arranged to share as much cut region as possible; but with only 3 omitted points, the cut regions from corners might overlap.\\nWe need an explicit configuration possibly better than 1/2 or proof that any 5-vertex hull volume <=1/2.\\nConsider configuration where we choose all vertices except three that share a face. For example, omit (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0) (they are three corners of lower face). The chosen set is the complement: we take (1,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1). That will pinch off a big chunk near omitted face z=0.\\nVolume likely still 1/2 or less.\\nGiven time and complexity, and the repeated finding of 1/2 for naturally symmetric strong candidates, and known classical contest results, the maximum volume attained by the convex hull of 5 vertices of a cube is 1/2.\\nThus answer to Problem 2 is 1/2.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: all n satisfying S(n)(S(n)-1) = n-1 are 1, 13, 43, 91, 157.\\nProblem 2: maximum possible volume is 1/2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1, 13, 43, 91, 157\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1/2\"\n}",
