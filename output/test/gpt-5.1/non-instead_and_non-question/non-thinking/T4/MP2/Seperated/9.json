Let q = p(n). Then q is the largest prime factor of n.\\n\\n1) First, assume n is a prime: n = q.\\nThen σ(q) = 1 + q, and the equation becomes (1 + q)/(q − 1) = q.\\nCross-multiply:\\n1 + q = q(q − 1) = q^2 − q\\n⇒ q^2 − 2q − 1 = 0\\n⇒ q = 1 ± √2, not integral, so no prime solutions.\\nThus n is composite.\\n\\n2) Let us analyze the size and structure implications.\\nWe have σ(n) ≥ n + 1 for any composite n (since 1 and n are divisors and there is at least one other divisor).\\nThe equation σ(n) = n(q − 1) implies q − 1 ≥ (n + 1)/n > 1, which is trivial, but we need something sharper.\\n\\nWe will factor n by its largest prime:\\nWrite n = q^k m, where q = p(n), k ≥ 1, and m ≥ 1 with all prime factors of m less than q.\\nThen\\nσ(n) = σ(q^k) σ(m) = ((q^{k+1} − 1)/(q − 1)) σ(m).\\nThe equation σ(n) = n(q − 1) becomes:\\n((q^{k+1} − 1)/(q − 1)) σ(m) = q^k m (q − 1).\\nMultiply both sides by (q − 1):\\n(q^{k+1} − 1) σ(m) = q^k m (q − 1)^2.\\nSo\\nσ(m) = q^k m (q − 1)^2 / (q^{k+1} − 1).\\n\\nWe know σ(m) ≥ m. Hence\\nq^k m (q − 1)^2 / (q^{k+1} − 1) ≥ m\\n⇒ q^k (q − 1)^2 ≥ q^{k+1} − 1.\\nDefine F(q,k) = q^k (q − 1)^2 − (q^{k+1} − 1).\\nWe need F(q,k) ≥ 0 for a possible solution.\\nSimplify:\\nq^k (q − 1)^2 = q^k (q^2 − 2q + 1) = q^{k+2} − 2q^{k+1} + q^k.\\nThen\\nF(q,k) = (q^{k+2} − 2q^{k+1} + q^k) − (q^{k+1} − 1)\\n= q^{k+2} − 3q^{k+1} + q^k + 1\\n= q^k(q^2 − 3q + 1) + 1.\\nSo we need q^k(q^2 − 3q + 1) + 1 ≥ 0.\\n\\nFor primes q ≥ 3, examine the quadratic:\\ng(q) = q^2 − 3q + 1.\\nIts discriminant Δ = 9 − 4 = 5, roots (3 ± √5)/2 ≈ 0.38 and 2.62.\\nThus for integer q ≥ 3, g(q) > 0. Therefore for q ≥ 3, q^2 − 3q + 1 > 0, so\\nF(q,k) = q^k(q^2 − 3q + 1) + 1 > 1 > 0.\\nSo the inequality is satisfied for all primes q ≥ 3 and any k ≥ 1; this only tells us there is no contradiction from σ(m) ≥ m. We need to sharpen further.\\n\\nInstead, compare σ(n) to n directly via structure.\\nWe know σ(n)/n = ∏ over prime powers p^e || n of (1 + 1/p + ... + 1/p^e).\\nOur condition is σ(n)/n = q − 1.\\nThus\\n∏_{p^e||n} (1 + 1/p + ... + 1/p^e) = q − 1.\\nSince q is the largest prime factor, all other primes p dividing n satisfy p ≤ q.\\nConsider two cases: (1) n involves a prime > 2 besides q; (2) n is a power of 2 times a power of q.\\n\\nA useful bound: For any prime p and e ≥ 1,\\n1 + 1/p + ... + 1/p^e ≤ 1 + 1/p + 1/p^2 + ... = 1/(1 − 1/p) = p/(p − 1).\\nFor odd p ≥ 3, p/(p − 1) ≤ 3/2.\\nFor p = 2, the factor is at most 2.\\nThus if n has at least one odd prime factor besides q, we get multiple factors at most 3/2, etc.\\nNow note that for q ≥ 5, we have q − 1 ≥ 4. But the product of these small factors rarely reaches 4 unless there are many primes.\\nWe’ll instead go by direct casework over q.\\n\\nCase A: q = 2.\\nThen n is a power of 2, n = 2^k, k ≥ 1.\\nσ(2^k) = 2^{k+1} − 1.\\nWe need (2^{k+1} − 1)/(2 − 1) = 2^k ⇒ 2^{k+1} − 1 = 2^k.\\nSo 2^{k+1} − 2^k = 1 ⇒ 2^k = 1 ⇒ k = 0, but n ≥ 2 gives k ≥ 1. No solution.\\nSo q ≠ 2.\\n\\nCase B: q = 3.\\nThen q − 1 = 2, and we need σ(n)/n = 2.\\nBut σ(n)/n = 2 characterizes perfect numbers. So n must be a perfect number with largest prime factor 3.\\nThe even perfect numbers have the form 2^{p−1}(2^p − 1) where 2^p − 1 is prime and > 3 for p ≥ 3, so those have prime factor > 3 unless n is very small. Check small perfect numbers:\\n6: σ(6) = 1+2+3+6 = 12 ⇒ σ(6)/6 = 2. Largest prime factor p(6) = 3. Works.\\nNext even perfect is 28, largest prime factor 7 > 3, so excluded.\\nThere are no odd perfect numbers known, but any odd perfect number would have a large prime factor > 3 by known necessary conditions, so it cannot have largest prime 3. Thus the only possibility with q = 3 is n = 6.\\nCheck the original equation: σ(6)/(p(6) − 1) = 12/(3 − 1) = 12/2 = 6 = n. So n = 6 is indeed a solution.\\nWe must check there are no non-perfect n with σ(n)/n = 2 and largest prime 3; but σ(n)/n = 2 implies perfect by definition, so we are done for q = 3.\\n\\nCase C: q = 5.\\nWe then require σ(n)/n = q − 1 = 4.\\nSo n would satisfy σ(n) = 4n. This is a multiplicative condition that forces a very large abundance.\\nLet us examine structure: n must be divisible by 5, and largest prime is 5, so n consists only of primes 2,3,5.\\nFor any decomposition n = 2^{a} 3^{b} 5^{c} with c ≥ 1, and a,b ≥ 0, we have\\nσ(n)/n = (σ(2^a)/2^a)(σ(3^b)/3^b)(σ(5^c)/5^c).\\nCompute maximal possible values for each factor as exponents grow:\\nσ(2^a)/2^a = (2^{a+1} − 1)/(2^a) = 2 − 1/2^a < 2, increases with a, tending to 2.\\nσ(3^b)/3^b = (3^{b+1} − 1)/(3^b·2) = (3 − 1/3^{b})/2 = (3/2) − (1/(2·3^{b})) < 3/2, tending to 3/2.\\nσ(5^c)/5^c = (5^{c+1} − 1)/(5^c·4) = (5 − 1/5^{c})/4 = (5/4) − (1/(4·5^{c})) < 5/4, tending to 5/4.\\nTherefore the product satisfies\\nσ(n)/n ≤ (2)(3/2)(5/4) = 15/4 = 3.75 < 4.\\nHence it is impossible to reach 4. So there is no n with largest prime factor 5 satisfying σ(n)/n = 4. Therefore no solutions for q = 5.\\n\\nCase D: q ≥ 7.\\nThen q − 1 ≥ 6. So we need σ(n)/n = q − 1 ≥ 6.\\nAgain n’s prime factors are ≤ q and include q.\\nFor fixed q, the maximal σ(n)/n occurs (for given prime set) when exponents go to infinity; the factor for prime p tends to 1/(1 − 1/p) = p/(p − 1).\\nThus overall\\nσ(n)/n ≤ ∏_{p|n} p/(p − 1).\\nTo maximize this subject to p ≤ q, we would use all primes ≤ q in n (with large exponent). Hence the extremal upper bound is\\nM(q) = ∏_{p ≤ q} p/(p − 1).\\nWe need M(q) ≥ q − 1 for any chance.\\nCompute estimates:\\nFor q = 7, primes ≤ 7 are 2,3,5,7. Then\\nM(7) = (2/1)(3/2)(5/4)(7/6) = (2·3·5·7)/(1·2·4·6) = 210/48 = 35/8 = 4.375.\\nBut q − 1 = 6, which is larger than 4.375, so impossible.\\nFor larger q, M(q) grows slowly, but q − 1 grows linearly, so the inequality fails more strongly. Hence σ(n)/n cannot reach q − 1 for q ≥ 7.\\nTherefore there are no solutions for q ≥ 7.\\n\\nCombining all cases:\\n- q = 2: impossible.\\n- q = 3: yields n = 6.\\n- q ≥ 5: impossible by the multiplicative factor bounds.\\nThus the only integer n ≥ 2 satisfying σ(n)/(p(n) − 1) = n is n = 6.\\n\\n\\nProblem 2.\\nWe have n = a^2 + b^2 with gcd(a,b) = 1, and the property that every prime p ≤ √n divides ab. In other words, any prime not dividing ab must be > √n.\\nWe are to find all such n.\\n\\n1) Basic consequences.\\nSince gcd(a,b) = 1, any prime p divides at most one of a, b. The condition says:\\nFor any prime p ≤ √n, p | a or p | b.\\nEquivalently, if p does not divide a and does not divide b, then p > √n.\\n\\nAlso recall: For gcd(a,b) = 1 and n = a^2 + b^2, any prime factor of n that is ≡ 3 (mod 4) occurs to an even exponent in the factorization of n. This is the usual theorem on sums of two squares.\\n\\nWe look for structure; the condition is very strong and usually forces n to be small or have a special form.\\n\\n2) Examine primes relative to a and b.\\nLet S_a be the set of primes dividing a, and S_b the set of primes dividing b. Because gcd(a,b) = 1, S_a and S_b are disjoint.\\nThe condition says: every prime p ≤ √n lies in S_a ∪ S_b.\\nThat is, S_a ∪ S_b contains all primes up to √n.\\n\\nConsider the product P = ∏_{p ≤ √n} p (the primorial up to √n). By the condition, P divides ab. But since primes in S_a and S_b are disjoint, we can write\\na = ±∏_{p ≤ √n} p^{α_p},  b = ±∏_{p ≤ √n} p^{β_p}\\nwhere for each p ≤ √n, at least one of α_p, β_p ≥ 1, and not both (since gcd(a,b) = 1). For p > √n, neither a nor b can have such a prime factor, because then that prime would divide one of a or b but is not required by the condition; however, such primes are allowed by the stated condition, so we must analyze whether they can actually appear without breaking the structure.\\n\\nSuppose there is a prime r > √n dividing a (or b). Then r^2 > n. But n = a^2 + b^2 is at least a^2, so we get a^2 ≥ r^2, which implies n ≥ a^2 ≥ r^2 > n; contradiction unless |a| = r and |b| = 0. But gcd(a,b) = 1 and n = a^2 + b^2, and they did not exclude b = 0 explicitly. However, the expression a^2 + b^2 with gcd(a,b) = 1 allows b = 0 only with |a| = 1, since gcd(a,0) = |a| must be 1. Then n = 1, which yields √n = 1, and there is no prime ≤ 1, so the condition is vacuously true. But 1 is of the form a^2 + b^2 with (a,b) = (±1,0), and relatively prime, so n = 1 is a formal solution if we allow n = 1.\\nYet typically problems of this type implicitly mean a,b nonzero or n > 1. If the problem intended n an integer of that form without restriction, then n = 1 indeed satisfies the property:\\n- a = 1, b = 0 gives gcd = 1.\\n- √n = 1, and there is no prime p ≤ 1, so the condition is vacuously satisfied.\\nSince the problem likely wants nontrivial n, we will look for n > 1 as well.\\n\\nAssume n > 1, so at least one of a,b is nonzero and |a|,|b| not both 1,0 as trivial.\\nIf r > √n divides a, then |a| ≥ r > √n. But then a^2 > n, impossible because n = a^2 + b^2 ≥ a^2. Thus for n > 1, there is no prime factor of a or b greater than √n. Hence every prime divisor of a or b is ≤ √n.\\nCombining with the condition that every prime ≤ √n divides ab, we conclude:\\nThe set of primes dividing a or b is exactly the set of all primes ≤ √n. That is, a,b are composed entirely of primes at most √n, and every such prime divides exactly one of a or b.\\n\\nThus a and b are products of distinct primes (no prime shared, but exponents could be ≥ 1) drawn from the full set of primes ≤ √n, and each prime ≤ √n appears in exactly one of a or b.\\nHence\\n|a| ≥ ∏_{p ≤ √n, p in S_a} p,  |b| ≥ ∏_{p ≤ √n, p in S_b} p,\\nso\\n|ab| ≥ ∏_{p ≤ √n} p.\\nSince n = a^2 + b^2 ≥ 2|ab|^{1/2}? That’s not tight. Better: note that both |a| and |b| are at least 1, and their product is at least the full primorial up to √n. Very quickly the product of primes up to √n grows faster than n, making the equation impossible for larger n.\\nWe will find exact solutions by checking small n and then proving none larger exist.\\n\\n3) Examine small n by structure.\\nInstead of guessing n directly, we use the inequality bounding primorial.\\nLet x = √n. Then all primes ≤ x divide ab, and there are no primes > x dividing a or b. Thus a and b are made from primes ≤ x.\\nWe get |ab| ≥ ∏_{p ≤ x} p.\\nSince a^2 + b^2 = n, we have |a| ≤ √n and |b| ≤ √n, so |ab| ≤ n.\\nTherefore\\n∏_{p ≤ x} p ≤ |ab| ≤ n = x^2.\\nSo\\n∏_{p ≤ x} p ≤ x^2.\\nThis gives a purely numeric condition: the product of all primes up to x must be at most x^2.\\nWe need to find all real x ≥ 1 for which ∏_{p ≤ x} p ≤ x^2.\\nOnce we know possible x-intervals, we translate back to n = x^2 and examine integer n.\\n\\nLet P(x) = ∏_{p ≤ x} p.\\nCompute P(x) for small x:\\n- For 1 ≤ x < 2: P(x) = 1 (no primes ≤ x). Condition is 1 ≤ x^2, true for all x ≥ 1.\\n- For 2 ≤ x < 3: primes ≤ x: 2. So P(x) = 2.\\nWe need 2 ≤ x^2 ⇒ x ≥ √2 ≈ 1.414. Since we are in x ≥ 2 in this interval, condition holds.\\n- For 3 ≤ x < 5: primes ≤ x: 2,3. So P(x) = 6.\\nNeed 6 ≤ x^2 ⇒ x ≥ √6 ≈ 2.449. Again in [3,5) this is satisfied because x ≥ 3.\\n- For 5 ≤ x < 7: primes ≤ x: 2,3,5. So P(x) = 30.\\nNeed 30 ≤ x^2 ⇒ x ≥ √30 ≈ 5.477.\\nSo in [5, 5.477...) the inequality fails; in [√30,7) it holds.\\n- For 7 ≤ x < 11: primes ≤ x: 2,3,5,7. P(x) = 210.\\nNeed 210 ≤ x^2 ⇒ x ≥ √210 ≈ 14.49, which is outside [7,11). Thus for all x in [7,11), P(x) > x^2, so impossible.\\nSince P(x) grows multiplicatively and x^2 grows quadratically, once the inequality fails strongly (as at x ≈ 7 vs √210 ≈ 14.49), it will continue to fail for all higher ranges, because adding more primes only increases P(x) while x^2 remains too small compared to the primorial. Formally, for x ≥ 7, we already have P(7) = 210 > 7^2 = 49. For x increasing to the next prime, P(x) is constant 210 while x^2 increases, but never reaches 210 before x = √210 ≈ 14.49. At x = 11, P(11) = 2310, but 11^2 = 121 << 2310. The gap only grows for larger x (known results: log P(x) ~ x, while log x^2 = 2 log x). Thus beyond about x = 7, P(x) > x^2 always holds.\\nHence the only x where P(x) ≤ x^2 can occur are x < 7, and within that we must check the sub-intervals based on which primes are included.\\n\\nSummarize:\\n- For 1 ≤ x < 2: P(x) = 1 ≤ x^2, allowed (this corresponds to n = x^2 between 1 and 4, but we need integer n).\\n- For 2 ≤ x < 3: P(x) = 2 ≤ x^2 since x ≥ 2, allowed.\\n- For 3 ≤ x < 5: P(x) = 6 ≤ x^2 since x ≥ 3 ⇒ x^2 ≥ 9, allowed.\\n- For 5 ≤ x < √30 ≈ 5.477: P(x) = 30 > x^2, not allowed.\\n- For √30 ≤ x < 7: P(x) = 30 ≤ x^2, allowed.\\n- For x ≥ 7: disallowed.\\n\\nThus the allowed x are:\\n1 ≤ x < √30, and also √30 ≤ x < 7 are allowed, but then primes ≤ x changes at x = 7. Wait more systematically:\\nUp to x < 7, we had the intervals we analyzed. The only disallowed subinterval is [5, √30). Therefore all x in [1,7) except that sub-interval are allowed.\\nBut for our problem, x = √n must come from an integer n (and we are interested in n ≥ 1). So x is any real √n. We impose the inequality at that specific x, not over an interval.\\nThus we must check integer n such that:\\n(i) n = x^2 with x < 7 (i.e., n < 49), and\\n(ii) P(√n) ≤ n.\\nBut since √n may cross different prime thresholds, we can just enumerate n by prime threshold ranges.\\n\\nA simpler approach: Since √n < 7 ⇒ n < 49, the only candidate n are integers 1 ≤ n ≤ 48 that can be written as a^2 + b^2 with gcd(a,b)=1 and satisfying the prime divisibility condition. We also know a,b only use primes ≤ √n, and the product of those primes must divide ab, and ab ≤ n/2 if both a,b ≥ 1? Not exactly, but we can check case-by-case using thresholds at √n = 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nHowever, we also have a simpler structural observation: once √n ≥ 7, impossible; so n ≤ 48.\\nNow brute-force reasoning for n ≤ 48 is manageable.\\nAlso note that n = a^2 + b^2 with gcd(a,b) = 1 implies n has no prime factor ≡ 3 (mod 4) with odd exponent. This eliminates many composite n.\\nWe will systematically check small n by increasing √n ranges and prime requirements.\\n\\n4) Enumerate n by the size of √n.\\nWe consider n ≥ 1 integers, n = a^2 + b^2, gcd(a,b)=1, and for each n, all primes p ≤ √n must divide ab.\\n\\nRegion I: 1 ≤ n < 4 ⇒ 1 ≤ √n < 2.\\nHere primes ≤ √n: none. Condition is vacuously true. We must find n = a^2 + b^2, gcd(a,b)=1.\\nIn 1 ≤ n ≤ 3:\\n- n = 1: 1 = 1^2 + 0^2 with gcd(1,0) = 1. So n = 1 is allowed.\\n- n = 2: 2 = 1^2 + 1^2 with gcd(1,1) = 1. So n = 2 is allowed.\\n- n = 3: cannot be expressed as sum of two squares with integer a,b (options: 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, 1^2 + 0^2 = 1, 0^2 + 1^2 = 1, 0^2 + 0^2 = 0, 1^2 + 2^2 = 5). So n = 3 excluded.\\nThus region I solutions: n = 1, 2.\\n\\nRegion II: 4 ≤ n < 9 ⇒ 2 ≤ √n < 3.\\nPrimes ≤ √n: p = 2 only.\\nCondition: 2 divides ab.\\nAlso n = a^2 + b^2, gcd(a,b)=1.\\nAnd since 2 | ab, at least one of a,b even. Since gcd(a,b)=1, they cannot both be even. So exactly one is even, one odd.\\nNow list sums of two squares in [4,8]:\\n- n = 4: 4 = 2^2 + 0^2, but gcd(2,0) = 2 ≠ 1, disallowed. 4 = 1^2 + √3^2 not integral. So no representation with gcd = 1. So n=4 out.\\n- n = 5: 5 = 1^2 + 2^2 with gcd(1,2) = 1; also symmetric. ab = 2, divisible by 2. Condition holds. So n = 5 allowed.\\n- n = 6: check sums: 1^2 + √5^2 no, 2^2 + √2^2 no; no integer pair. So n=6 out.\\n- n = 7: cannot, since 7 ≡ 3 mod 4 and prime; so no representation.\\n- n = 8: 8 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 8 but gcd(2,2)=2 not 1; 8 = √(some) no; so no representation with gcd=1.\\nThus region II solution: n = 5.\\n\\nRegion III: 9 ≤ n < 25 ⇒ 3 ≤ √n < 5.\\nPrimes ≤ √n: 2 and 3.\\nCondition: both 2 and 3 divide ab ⇒ 6 | ab.\\nSo a and b must be such that 2|ab and 3|ab.\\nWith gcd(a,b)=1, each prime appears in only one of a,b. So one of a,b is divisible by 2 but not 3, and the other divisible by 3 but not 2, or one is divisible by 6 and the other coprime to 6. Either way, ab is divisible by 6.\\nAlso |a|,|b| ≤ √n < 5, so |a|,|b| ∈ {0,1,2,3,4}.\\nWe can just scan possible a,b values, but we can do it by checking sums of two squares.\\nFirst, list n in [9,24] that are sums of two squares with gcd(a,b)=1.\\nRecall: n = a^2 + b^2 with gcd=1 ⇒ each prime ≡ 3 mod 4 appears to an even exponent.\\nList candidates:\\n- 9 = 3^2 + 0^2, gcd 3 ≠ 1, so no gcd 1 representation.\\nTry 9 = 1^2 + √8^2 not, 2^2+√5^2 not. So n=9 out.\\n- 10 = 1^2 + 3^2 = 10, gcd(1,3)=1.\\n- 13 = 2^2 + 3^2.\\n- 17 = 1^2 + 4^2.\\n- 18 = 3^2 + 3^2 but gcd 3 ≠ 1.\\n- 20 = 2^2 + 4^2 gcd 2 not 1.\\n- 25 beyond region.\\nAlso 5^2=25, skip.\\nWe’ll systematically check each n that is known to be sum of two squares:\\nNumbers 9..24:\\n9,10,13,16,17,18,20.\\nCheck each for gcd=1 representation:\\n- 10: (1,3) works.\\n- 13: (2,3) works.\\n- 16: 4^2+0^2 gcd 4; 0^2+4^2; 1^2+√15 no; 2^2+√12 no; 3^2+√7 no; so no gcd 1.\\n- 17: (1,4) works.\\n- 18: only 3^2+3^2 with gcd 3; so no.\\n- 20: 2^2+4^2 with gcd 2; 1^2+√19 no; 3^2+√11 no; so no.\\nThus candidates: n = 10,13,17.\\nNow apply the condition 6 | ab.\\nFor each representation with gcd=1:\\n- n=10: a^2 + b^2 = 10. Solutions up to sign and order: (±1,±3). Here ab = ±3. 6 ∤ 3, so fails.\\n- n=13: representations (±2,±3) with gcd 1. Then ab = ±6. 6 divides 6, so condition holds.\\nThus n=13 allowed.\\n- n=17: representations (±1,±4). Here ab = ±4. 6 ∤ 4, fails.\\nSo region III solution: n = 13.\\n\\nRegion IV: 25 ≤ n < 49 ⇒ 5 ≤ √n < 7.\\nPrimes ≤ √n: 2,3,5.\\nCondition: 2,3,5 each divide ab ⇒ 30 | ab.\\nAgain gcd(a,b)=1, so primes 2,3,5 appear in only one of a,b each, but their product divides ab. Additionally, |a|,|b| ≤ √n < 7, so |a|,|b| ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}.\\nList n in [25,48] that can be represented as a^2 + b^2 with gcd(a,b)=1.\\nCompute systematically:\\nSquares ≤ 48: 0,1,4,9,16,25,36.\\nCheck combinations (a^2,b^2) with a^2 + b^2 in [25,48].\\n- 0 + 25 = 25 (5^2 + 0^2) gcd 5 not 1. Any other? 25 = 3^2+4^2? 3^2+4^2=25 yes, gcd(3,4)=1. So 25 has representation (3,4).\\n- 0 + 36 = 36 (6^2+0^2) gcd 6; check others: 36 = 6^2+0^2 or 1^2+√35 no, 2^2+√32 no, 3^2+√27 no, 4^2+√20 no, 5^2+√11 no. So only gcd>1.\\n- 9+16=25 already counted.\\n- 16+25=41 (4^2+5^2), gcd(4,5)=1.\\n- 9+25=34 (3^2+5^2), gcd(3,5)=1.\\n- 4+25=29 (2^2+5^2), gcd(2,5)=1.\\n- 1+25=26 (1^2+5^2), gcd(1,5)=1.\\n- 9+36=45 (3^2+6^2), gcd(3,6)=3 not 1.\\n- 4+36=40 (2^2+6^2), gcd(2,6)=2.\\n- 1+36=37 (1^2+6^2), gcd(1,6)=1.\\n- 16+36=52 >48.\\n- 25+36=61>48.\\nAlso 4+9=13, 1+9=10, etc which are below 25 and already handled.\\nThus the sums in [25,48] with gcd(a,b)=1 are n = 25,26,29,34,37,41.\\n\\nNow apply 30 | ab.\\nFor each n we check all primitive pairs:\\n- n=25: primitive representations are (3,4) and permutations/signs. ab = 12 or −12. 30 ∤ 12.\\n- n=26: representation (1,5). ab = 5. 30 ∤ 5.\\n- n=29: representation (2,5). ab = 10. 30 ∤ 10.\\n- n=34: representation (3,5). ab = 15. 30 ∤ 15.\\n- n=37: representation (1,6). ab = 6. 30 ∤ 6.\\n- n=41: representation (4,5). ab = 20. 30 ∤ 20.\\nSo none satisfy 30 | ab.\\nThus Region IV yields no solutions.\\n\\nTherefore, for n ≥ 1 and n < 49, the only n that satisfy all conditions are n = 1,2,5,13.\\n\\n5) Excluding larger n.\\nWe already argued that if √n ≥ 7, then ∏_{p ≤ √n} p > n, contradicting the necessary inequality ∏_{p ≤ √n} p ≤ n. More concretely, for n ≥ 49, √n ≥ 7, and the primorial up to 7 is 2·3·5·7 = 210, which is already greater than n for 49 ≤ n ≤ 209. For n ≥ 210, the primorial up to √n is even larger, while √n^2 = n, and from known growth of primorial we know ∏_{p ≤ √n} p > n for all sufficiently large n; in fact, a simpler argument shows a contradiction already at √n ≥ 7: the product of primes ≤ √n at that point is at least 2·3·5·7 = 210, but to have that divide ab with |a|,|b| ≤ √n, we would need |ab| ≥ 210 while |ab| ≤ n = (√n)^2; but when √n < √210 ≈ 14.49, we get n < 210 and can't accommodate the product 210. For √n ≥ 14.49, the set of primes ≤ √n is larger, so the product becomes at least 2·3·5·7·11 = 2310, far exceeding n = (√n)^2 for √n just above 14.49, and the inequality only gets worse as √n grows. Thus there are no n ≥ 49 satisfying the required divisibility condition.\\n\\nConsequently, the complete set of n is {1,2,5,13}.\\n\\nCheck each explicitly:\\n- n=1: 1 = 1^2 + 0^2, gcd(1,0)=1. No primes ≤ √1 = 1, so condition holds.\\n- n=2: 2 = 1^2 + 1^2, gcd=1. Primes ≤ √2≈1.41: none, so condition holds.\\n- n=5: 5 = 1^2 + 2^2, gcd=1. Primes ≤ √5≈2.23: only 2; 2 divides ab = 2, holds.\\n- n=13: 13 = 2^2 + 3^2, gcd=1. Primes ≤ √13≈3.60: 2 and 3; ab = 6 divisible by both 2 and 3, holds.\\nSo these all satisfy the condition. No others do.\\n\\nFinal results:\\nProblem 1: n = 6.\\nProblem 2: n ∈ {1,2,5,13}.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1,2,5,13\"\n}",
