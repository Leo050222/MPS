The total central angle of a circle is $360^\\\\circ$, so $4x + 20 + 140 = 360$. Solving gives $4x = 200 \\\\implies x = 50$. Assuming the shaded regions are the four with angle $x^\\\\circ$ (as no other shading is specified), their total angle is $4 \\\\times 50 = 200^\\\\circ$. The probability is $\\\\frac{200}{360} = \\\\frac{5}{9}$.\\n\\nProblem 2: A happy pair $(m, n)$ requires $\\\\gcd(m, n)$ to be a perfect square. Factorize $205800 = 2^3 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 5^2 \\\\cdot 7^3$ and $35k = 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot k$. The $\\\\gcd(205800, 35k)$ must have even exponents in its prime factorization. Analyzing exponents:\\n- For prime 2: $\\\\min(3, a)$ must be even $\\\\implies a = 0, 2$.\\n- For prime 3: $\\\\min(1, b)$ must be even $\\\\implies b = 0$.\\n- For prime 5: $\\\\min(2, 1 + c)$ must be even $\\\\implies c \\\\geq 1$.\\n- For prime 7: $\\\\min(3, 1 + d)$ must be even $\\\\implies d = 1$.\\n\\n$k = 2^a \\\\cdot 3^b \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7^d \\\\cdot m$ with $m$ coprime to $210$.
