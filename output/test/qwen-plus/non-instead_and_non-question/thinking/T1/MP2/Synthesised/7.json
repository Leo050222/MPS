  "math_problem": "What is the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region if a circular spinner is divided into six regions, four regions each have a central angle of $x^{\\circ}$, and the remaining regions have central angles of $20^{\\circ}$ and $140^{\\circ}$, where the shaded regions consist of the $140^{\\circ}$ region and two of the $x^{\\circ}$ regions? Let $N = \\theta + 2700$, where $\\theta$ is the total central angle in degrees of the shaded regions. We call the pair $(m, n)$ of positive integers a happy pair if the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is a perfect square. For example, $(20, 24)$ is a happy pair because the greatest common divisor of 20 and 24 is 4. Suppose that $k$ is a positive integer such that $(205800, 35k)$ is a happy pair. What is the number of possible values of $k$ with $k \\leq N$?",
