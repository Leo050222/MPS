  "math_problem": "Let $Q(x)=x^{2}+2x+3$, and suppose that $P(x)$ is a polynomial such that $P(Q(x))=x^{6}+6x^{5}+18x^{4}+32x^{3}+35x^{2}+22x+8$. Let $k = Q(r) - 1$, where $r$ is the unique real root of the derivative of $Q$. Does there exist an irrational number $\\alpha>k$ such that $\\left\\lfloor\\alpha^{n}\\right\\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod 2017)$ for all integers $n \\geq k$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, find the unique real root $ r $ of $ Q'(x) $. Since $ Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3 $, its derivative is $ Q'(x) = 2x + 2 $, which has a root at $ x = -1 $. Compute $ Q(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 3 = 2 $, so $ k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 $. The problem asks whether there exists an irrational $ \\\\alpha > 1 $ such that $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $ for all integers $ n \\\\geq 1 $.\\n\\nFor $ n = 1 $, $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha \\\\rfloor $ must be divisible by 2017, so $ \\\\alpha \\\\in [2017, 2018) $. For $ n = 2 $, $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^2 \\\\rfloor $ must also be divisible by 2017. However, analyzing the binomial expansion of $ (2017 + \\\\epsilon)^n $ for small $ \\\\epsilon > 0 $, the term $ n \\\\cdot 2017^{n-1} \\\\epsilon $ grows with $ n $. For any fixed $ \\\\epsilon > 0 $, there exists some $ n $ where $ n \\\\cdot 2017^{n-1} \\\\epsilon > 1 $, causing $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor $ to exceed $ 2017^n $ by at least 1, making $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $. \\n\\nIf $ \\\\alpha < 2017 $, $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha \\\\rfloor < 2017 $, so $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha \\\\rfloor \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $, failing for $ n = 1 $. The only case where $ \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha^n \\\\rfloor \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2017} $ for all $ n $ is $ \\\\alpha = 2017 $, but it is rational. Thus, no irrational $ \\\\alpha > 1 $ satisfies the condition.\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\"\n}",
