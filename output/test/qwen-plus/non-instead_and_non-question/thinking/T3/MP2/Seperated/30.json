Factorizing 2019 = 3 × 673 (both primes), we express n as 3^a × 673^b × m (m coprime to 3 and 673). By expanding φ(2019n) and φ(n²) using the multiplicative property of φ, we derive conditions on a, b, and m. Solving these conditions case by case, we find valid solutions when (a,b,m) = (2,0,224), (0,1,2), and (1,1,1), corresponding to n = 2016, 1346, and 2019 respectively. These are the only positive integers satisfying the equation.\\n\\nProblem 2: The recurrence relation is transformed by defining b_n = a_n + 1, simplifying it to b_{n+1} = b_n² / b_{n-1}, indicating a geometric sequence for b_n. With b₁ = 2 (since a₁ = 1) and a₉ = 7 implying b₉ = 8, we solve for the common ratio r. Using b₉ = 2r⁸ = 8, we find r⁸ = 4, so r⁴ = 2. Thus, b₅ = 2r⁴ = 4, giving a₅ = b₅ - 1 = 3.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1346,2016,2019\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
