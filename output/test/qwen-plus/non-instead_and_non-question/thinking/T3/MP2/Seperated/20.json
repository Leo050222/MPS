Testing small values and using symmetry, we find that $(0, 0)$ satisfies the equation. For non-zero solutions, consider $m = -k$ (negative) and $n$ (positive), leading to $k^5 + n^5 = 16kn$. Using AM-GM inequality, $kn \\\\leq 4$, and checking all valid pairs, only $(k, n) = (2, 2)$ works, giving $(m, n) = (-2, 2)$. Other cases (both positive, both negative, or mixed signs) yield no solutions. Thus, the integer solutions are $(0, 0)$ and $(-2, 2)$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given $pqr = 48$ with $p < q < r$, we minimize $\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$. Using Lagrange multipliers, we find the critical point occurs at $p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$ (since $q = 2p$, $r = 3p$, and $pqr = 48$). This gives $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{3}{2}$. Testing integer factorizations and verifying via calculus confirms this is the minimum.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"(0, 0), (-2, 2)\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
