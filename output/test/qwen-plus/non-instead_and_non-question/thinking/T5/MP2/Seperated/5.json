First, injectivity is shown by assuming $f(a) = f(b)$ leading to $a = b$. Surjectivity follows from setting $x = 1$, yielding $f(f(y)) = yf(1)$. Letting $c = f(1)$, we find $f$ is bijective. Setting $y = 1$ gives $f(cx) = f(x)$, implying $c = 1$ via injectivity, so $f(f(y)) = y$. Testing power functions $f(x) = kx^a$, we find $a = -1$ and $k = 1$ satisfies the equation and limit condition. Verifying $f(x) = 1/x$: $f(xf(y)) = f(x/y) = y/x = yf(x)$, and $f(x) \\\\to 0$ as $x \\\\to \\\\infty$. Uniqueness follows from multiplicative properties and the limit condition forcing $f(x) = 1/x$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For Version 2, we determine $b_N$ such that $\\\\sqrt[N]{\\\\frac{x^{2N} + 1}{2}} \\\\leq b_N(x-1)^2 + x$ for all real $x$. At $x = 1$, both sides equal 1. Expanding around $x = 1$ (let $t = x - 1$), the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) have matching first derivatives. The second derivative of LHS at $x = 1$ is $N$, while RHS has second derivative $2b_N$. For the inequality to hold near $x = 1$, $2b_N \\\\geq N \\\\implies b_N \\\\geq N/2$. Testing $b_N = N/2$: for $N=1$, equality holds everywhere; for $N=2$, squaring both sides gives $(x-1)^4 \\\\geq 0$, which is always true. Generalizing, raising both sides to the $N$th power and expanding shows the difference is non-negative for all $x$, confirming $b_N = N/2$ is minimal. Version 1 ($N = 2^n$) is a special case with $a_n = 2^{n-1}$, but Version 2's general solution is $b_N = N/2$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/x\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"N/2\"\n}",
