So for large s, S(n) << s, and we won't get equality.\\n\\nWe found solutions: n = 1, 13, 43, 91, 157.\\n\\nWait — earlier:\\ns=1 → n=1 → S(n)=1 → 1*0 = 0 = 1-1 → yes.\\ns=4 → n=13 → S=4 → 4*3=12 = 13-1 → yes.\\ns=7 → n=43 → 7*6=42 = 43-1 → yes.\\ns=10 → n=91 → 10*9=90 = 91-1 → yes.\\ns=13 → n=157 → 13*12=156 = 157-1 → yes.\\n\\nNow try s=16? Already did → n=241 → S=7 → no.\\n\\nWhat about s=19? n=343 → S=10 → no.\\n\\nTry s=16 to s=20 again? Already done.\\n\\nBut wait — maybe we missed some?\\n\\nAlternatively, note that S(n) ≡ n mod 9. So s ≡ n mod 9.\\nBut n = s^2 - s + 1.\\nSo s ≡ s^2 - s + 1 mod 9 →\\ns^2 - 2s + 1 ≡ 0 mod 9 → (s-1)^2 ≡ 0 mod 9 → s ≡ 1 mod 3? Wait:\\n(s-1)^2 ≡ 0 mod 9 → s-1 ≡ 0 mod 3 → s ≡ 1 mod 3? Not exactly.\\nActually, (s-1)^2 divisible by 9 → s-1 divisible by 3 → s ≡ 1 mod 3.\\nBut more precisely, since square ≡0 mod 9, then s-1 must be divisible by 3, but not necessarily by 9.\\nFor example, if s-1=3, then (3)^2=9≡0 mod 9 → ok.\\nIf s-1=6, 36≡0 mod 9 → ok.\\nIf s-1=9, 81≡0 → ok.\\nSo s ≡ 1 mod 3? s-1 divisible by 3 → s ≡ 1 mod 3.\\nSo s = 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,... — which matches our search.\\nWe already checked up to s=32.\\n\\nNow check s=34: n=34^2 -34 +1=1156-34+1=1123; S(1123)=1+1+2+3=7≠34 → no.\\n\\ns=37: n=1369-37+1=1333; S=1+3+3+3=10≠37 → no.\\n\\ns=40: n=1600-40+1=1561; S=1+5+6+1=13≠40 → no.\\n\\nSeems unlikely.\\n\\nCheck s=1,4,7,10,13 → all gave valid solutions.\\nNext s ≡1 mod 3: s=16 → n=241 → S=7 → no.\\ns=19 → n=343 → S=10 → no.\\ns=22 → n=463 → S=13 → no.\\ns=25 → n=601 → S=7 → no.\\ns=28 → n=757 → S=19 → no.\\ns=31 → n=931 → S=13 → no.\\ns=34 → n=1123 → S=7 → no.\\ns=37 → n=1333 → S=10 → no.\\ns=40 → n=1561 → S=13 → no.\\ns=43 → n=43^2 -43+1=1849-43+1=1807; S=1+8+0+7=16≠43 → no.\\n\\nSo only s=1,4,7,10,13 work → n=1,13,43,91,157.\\n\\nDouble-check:\\nn=1: S=1 → 1*0=0=1-1 → yes.\\nn=13: S=4 → 4*3=12=12 → yes.\\nn=43: S=7 → 7*6=42=42 → yes.\\nn=91: S=10 → 10*9=90=90 → yes.\\nn=157: S=1+5+7=13 → 13*12=156=156 → yes.\\n\\nAre there any others?\\nTry s=46: n=46^2 -46+1=2116-46+1=2071; S=2+0+7+1=10≠46 → no.\\n\\nSeems these are all.\\n\\nBut wait — could there be larger n with more digits where digit sum is relatively high? For example, numbers with many 9's.\\nBut n = s^2 - s + 1, and s = S(n) ≤ 9d, where d is number of digits of n.\\nAlso, n ≥ 10^{d-1}.\\nSo s^2 - s + 1 ≥ 10^{d-1}, and s ≤ 9d.\\nThus (9d)^2 ≥ s^2 ≈ n ≥ 10^{d-1} → 81d^2 ≥ 10^{d-1}\\nThis fails for large d.\\nCheck d=4: 81*16=1296; 10^3=1000 → 1296>1000 → possible.\\nd=5: 81*25=2025 < 10^4=10000 → no.\\nSo maximum d=4.\\n\\nSo n has at most 4 digits.\\nSo s ≤ 9*4=36.\\nWe already checked s up to 37, so we covered all possibilities.\\n\\nWithin s from 1 to 36, s ≡1 mod 3? From earlier congruence: (s-1)^2 ≡0 mod 9 → s-1 divisible by 3, but actually stronger: since (s-1)^2 ≡0 mod 9, s-1 must be divisible by 3, but (s-1)^2 divisible by 9 means |s-1| divisible by 3, but square divisible by 9 implies the number divisible by 3, but not necessarily by 9? No: counterexample: 3^2=9≡0 mod 9 → 3 is divisible by 3 but not by 9, but 3^2=9 divisible by 9.\\nSimilarly, 6^2=36≡0 mod 9.\\nSo s-1 can be divisible by 3 but not by 9.\\nSo s ≡1 mod 3 is sufficient? But we need (s-1)^2 ≡0 mod 9.\\nIf s-1 ≡0 mod 3, say s-1=3k, then (s-1)^2=9k^2 ≡0 mod 9 always. So yes, s ≡1 mod 3 is necessary and sufficient for the congruence.\\nSo s=1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,28,31,34.\\nWe checked all.\\nOnly s=1,4,7,10,13 give S(n)=s.\\nSo solutions: n=1,13,43,91,157.\\n\\nProblem 2: Penta chooses 5 vertices of a unit cube. What is the maximum possible volume of the figure whose vertices are the 5 chosen points?\\n\\nThe figure is a polyhedron with 5 vertices. Since it's in 3D, the convex hull of 5 points could be a tetrahedron with an extra point inside or on a face, but to maximize volume, likely the 5 points are in convex position.\\n\\nMaximum volume occurs when the 5 points are as spread out as possible.\\n\\nA unit cube has side length 1, so volume 1.\\nVertices are all points with coordinates 0 or 1 in x,y,z.\\n\\nWe want to choose 5 vertices to maximize the volume of their convex hull.\\n\\nNote: The convex hull of 5 points in 3D can be:\\n- A polyhedron with 5 vertices. Possible types: a triangular bipyramid, a square pyramid, or other.\\n\\nTo maximize volume, probably avoid having one point inside the convex hull of the other four.\\n\\nSo assume all 5 points are vertices of the convex hull.\\n\\nThe maximum volume polyhedron with 5 vertices inscribed in the cube.\\n\\nIdea: take a face of the cube and choose all 4 vertices of one face, and then the fifth point as the opposite vertex? But opposite vertex might not be best.\\n\\nSuppose we take four coplanar points — like a face. Then they form a square of side 1. Then adding a fifth point. The convex hull would be a square pyramid.\\nVolume of pyramid = (1/3) * base area * height.\\nBase area = 1*1 = 1.\\nHeight is the perpendicular distance from the apex to the base plane.\\nIf the base is a face, say z=0, then height is the z-coordinate of the fifth point. If we take the opposite face, z=1, then height=1, so volume = (1/3)*1*1 = 1/3.\\nBut is this the maximum?\\n\\nPerhaps we can do better by not taking a full face.\\n\\nAnother idea: take five points that include two opposite vertices.\\n\\nOr consider symmetry.\\n\\nNote: the maximum volume simplex in the cube is the tetrahedron with vertices at (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1) — this has volume 1/3? Let me compute.\\nGeneral formula for tetrahedron volume with vertices A,B,C,D:\\nV = (1/6)|scalar triple product (AB·(AC×AD))|\\nSet A=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1)\\nAB = (1,1,0), AC=(1,0,1), AD=(0,1,1)\\nAC × AD = determinant i(j k) for vectors (1,0,1) and (0,1,1):\\ni(0*1 - 1*1) - j(1*1 - 1*0) + k(1*1 - 0*0) = i(-1) - j(1) + k(1) = (-1,-1,1)? Wait:\\ni(0*1 - 1*1) = i(0-1)= -i\\nj component: minus (1*1 - 1*0) = -(1-0)= -1 → +1 j? Standard cross product:\\ni( Ay Bz - Az By ) no:\\nFor U×V, i(Uy Vz - Uz Vy) - j(Ux Vz - Uz Vx) + k(Ux Vy - Uy Vx)\\nU=AC=(1,0,1), V=AD=(0,1,1)\\ni(0*1 - 1*1) = i(0-1)= -i\\n-j(1*1 - 1*0) = -j(1-0)= -j\\n+k(1*1 - 0*0)= k(1-0)= k\\nSo (-1, -1, 1)? The j component is negative of that, so vector is (-1, -(-1)? No:\\nThe formula gives i component: Uy Vz - Uz Vy = 0*1 - 1*1 = -1\\nj component: -(Ux Vz - Uz Vx) = -(1*1 - 1*0) = -(1) = -1 → so -1 in j direction\\nk component: Ux Vy - Uy Vx = 1*1 - 0*0 = 1\\nSo cross product = (-1, -1, 1)\\nThen AB · this = (1,1,0) · (-1,-1,1) = -1 -1 + 0 = -2\\nAbsolute value 2, so V = (1/6)*| -2 | = 2/6 = 1/3.\\nYes, volume 1/3.\\nBut this is a tetrahedron, only 4 points. We have 5 points.\\nWith 5 points, we might get more volume.\\n\\nBack to square pyramid: volume 1/3, same as this tetrahedron.\\nBut perhaps we can get more.\\n\\nAnother configuration: suppose we take a tetrahedron and add a fifth point.\\nBut if we add a point outside, the convex hull might be larger.\\n\\nNote that the entire cube has volume 1, so maximum possible is less than 1.\\n\\nCan we get more than 1/3?\\n\\nTry to take five points not including a full face.\\n\\nIdea: take all points except three that are mutually adjacent? Or use symmetry.\\n\\nConsider the convex hull of five vertices.\\nIn a cube, any five vertices will include at least one face? Not necessarily.\\n\\nTotal vertices: 8. Choosing 5 is same as leaving out 3.\\nTo maximize volume, leave out three vertices that are close together.\\n\\nSuppose we leave out three vertices that meet at a corner. Say leave out (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0). Then the remaining five are: (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1), and also (0,0,0) is out, but (0,0,1) is in, etc.\\nList: all vertices:\\n(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,0)\\n(0,0,1), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1)\\nLeave out (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0) — these are three neighbors of (0,0,0).\\nThen remaining: (1,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1)\\nSo points: A=(1,1,0), B=(0,0,1), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1), E=(1,1,1)\\nNow find convex hull.\\nPlot: A is (1,1,0), E is (1,1,1), C is (1,0,1), D is (0,1,1), B is (0,0,1)\\nSo B,C,D,E are all at z=1, forming a square? B=(0,0,1), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1), E=(1,1,1) — yes, the entire top face.\\nAnd A=(1,1,0) is below E.\\nBut we have all four top vertices and one bottom vertex (1,1,0).\\nConvex hull: since the top is a square, and A is connected, but is A visible?\\nPoints: the top face is z=1, A is at (1,1,0). So it's directly below E.\\nSo the convex hull is a square pyramid with base B,C,D,E and apex A.\\nBut base is at z=1, apex at z=0, so height is 1.\\nBase area = 1*1 = 1.\\nVolume = (1/3) * base area * height = (1/3)*1*1 = 1/3.\\nSame as before.\\n\\nBut we have five points, but in this case, the base is planar, so pyramid.\\n\\nCan we make a non-planar base?\\n\\nSuppose we don't take a full face.\\n\\nTry to take a tetrahedron and add a point.\\nBut earlier tetrahedron had volume 1/3, adding a point might increase volume.\\n\\nSuppose we take the five points: (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), and (1,1,1)\\nSo almost the tetrahedron but add (1,1,1)\\nThe tetrahedron was (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1) — volume 1/3.\\nAdd (1,1,1).\\nNow, is (1,1,1) outside this tetrahedron?\\nCheck: the tetrahedron has points. (1,1,1) might be outside.\\nCompute convex hull.\\nPoints: A=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1), E=(1,1,1)\\nNote that E = (1,1,1)\\nNow, vectors.\\nNotice that E = B + (0,0,1), but B is (1,1,0), so E=(1,1,1)\\nSimilarly, C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1)\\nNow, the convex hull: likely a polyhedron with faces.\\nWe can divide into tetrahedrons.\\nFor example, one way: fix A, and form tetrahedrons with faces of the other four.\\nBut the other four: B,C,D,E.\\nPoints B,C,D,E: B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1), E=(1,1,1)\\nAre they coplanar? Probably not.\\nCompute the volume of the convex hull by dividing into tetrahedrons.\\nOne method: choose a vertex, say A=(0,0,0), and connect to all faces of the convex hull of B,C,D,E.\\nFirst, what is conv(B,C,D,E)?\\nPoints: B(1,1,0), C(1,0,1), D(0,1,1), E(1,1,1)\\nNote that E is above B, C, D.\\nActually, these four points: let's see if they form a tetrahedron.\\nCompute volume of tetrahedron B,C,D,E.\\nSet B as origin: vectors BC = C-B = (1-1,0-1,1-0)=(0,-1,1)\\nBD = D-B = (0-1,1-1,1-0)=(-1,0,1)\\nBE = E-B = (1-1,1-1,1-0)=(0,0,1)\\nVolume = (1/6) | scalar triple product BC · (BD × BE) |\\nFirst, BD × BE = (-1,0,1) × (0,0,1) = i(0*1 - 1*0) - j( -1*1 - 1*0 ) + k( -1*0 - 0*0 ) = i(0) - j(-1) + k(0) = (0,1,0)\\nThen BC · (0,1,0) = (0,-1,1) · (0,1,0) = 0*0 + (-1)*1 + 1*0 = -1\\nAbs value 1, so volume = (1/6)*1 = 1/6.\\nSo tetrahedron BCDE has volume 1/6.\\nBut is it convex hull? Are there other points? Only these four, so yes.\\nNow, the full set: A,B,C,D,E.\\nIs A connected? The convex hull should include A.\\nNow, is A outside the tetrahedron BCDE? Probably yes.\\nTo find volume of pentahedron, we can split into tetrahedrons.\\nFor example, split into tetrahedrons ABCD, ABCE, ABDE, ACDE, but may overlap.\\nBetter: fix point A, and form tetrahedrons with each face of BCDE.\\nBut BCDE is a tetrahedron, so it has four faces.\\nFaces of tetrahedron BCDE:\\nFace BCD: points B,C,D\\nFace BCE: B,C,E\\nFace BDE: B,D,E\\nFace CDE: C,D,E\\nNow, for each face, form tetrahedron with A.\\nBut only if A is on the correct side.\\nSince the whole thing is convex, and A is likely outside, we can compute the sum of volumes of tetrahedrons A-BCD, A-BCE, A-BDE, A-CDE, but this would overcount or be incorrect because they overlap.\\nActually, for a polyhedron, if we triangulate the boundary, but here the convex hull may have different faces.\\nNote that points A,B,C,D form a tetrahedron we know: volume 1/3.\\nAdding E=(1,1,1).\\nWhere is E relative to tetrahedron ABCD?\\nTetrahedron A(0,0,0), B(1,1,0), C(1,0,1), D(0,1,1)\\nE(1,1,1)\\nWe can check if E is inside or outside.\\nOne way: compute barycentric coordinates.\\nOr see the plane equations.\\nNote that in the tetrahedron ABCD, the point E might be outside.\\nObserve that the centroid or something.\\nCompute the volume by another method.\\nUse the general formula for convex hull volume.\\nSince all points are vertices of the cube, we can list the faces.\\nNote that E = (1,1,1), and the tetrahedron ABCD has points with sum of coordinates: A:0, B:2, C:2, D:2. E:3.\\nLikely E is outside.\\nIn fact, the convex hull of A,B,C,D,E should include E as a vertex.\\nNow, to compute volume, we can divide the polyhedron into two parts: for example, tetrahedron ABCD and tetrahedron ABCE, but they share face ABC, but E may not be on the same side.\\nBetter: notice that points A,B,C,D,E — we can take tetrahedrons that cover without overlap.\\nFor example, one common way is to pick a vertex and connect to all non-adjacent faces, but perhaps pick A and form tetrahedrons with triangles that are faces.\\nFrom the configuration, likely the convex hull has faces: triangle ABC, ABD, ACD, and then with E, perhaps triangles involving E.\\nNote that E is adjacent to B,C,D.\\nActually, looking at coordinates, the polyhedron might be a square pyramid or something else.\\nLet's list the points again: A(0,0,0), B(1,1,0), C(1,0,1), D(0,1,1), E(1,1,1)\\nNow, consider the vectors.\\nNotice that E - B = (0,0,1), C - B = (0,-1,1), D - B = (-1,0,1), A - B = (-1,-1,0)\\nPerhaps compute the convex hull by finding which points are extreme.\\nWe can use the fact that the volume can be computed by dividing into three tetrahedrons, for example.\\nTry to see if the polyhedron can be divided into tetrahedron A,B,C,E and tetrahedron A,C,D,E and tetrahedron A,B,D,E, but then triangle A,C,E is shared, but we miss the center.\\nBetter: since B,C,D,E are not coplanar, and A is another point.\\nNote that the line from A to E might be a diagonal.\\nAnother idea: the five points include the tetrahedron A,B,C,D of volume 1/3, and E is outside, so the new convex hull will have volume greater than 1/3.\\nSpecifically, when we add E, we add the volume of the tetrahedron formed by E and the face it sees.\\nWhich face of the tetrahedron ABCD is visible from E?\\nThat is, which face has E on the opposite side of the supporting plane.\\nTake face BCD: points B(1,1,0), C(1,0,1), D(0,1,1)\\nFind the plane equation.\\nVectors BC = (0,-1,1), BD = (-1,0,1)\\nNormal vector = BC × BD = i( (-1)*1 - 1*0 ) - j( 0*1 - 1*(-1) ) + k( 0*0 - (-1)*(-1) ) = i(-1) - j(0 +1) + k(0 -1) = (-1, -1, -1)? Compute:\\ni( Uy Vz - Uz Vy ) = i( (-1)*1 - 1*0 ) = i(-1 - 0) = -i\\nj component: - ( Ux Vz - Uz Vx ) = - ( 0*1 - 1*(-1) ) = - (0 +1) = -1 → so -j component is -1, meaning +1 in j direction? No:\\nThe j component of the vector is - (Ux Vz - Uz Vx) = - (0*1 - 1*(-1)) = - (0 +1) = -1\\nSo the vector is ( -1, -1, ? )\\nk component: Ux Vy - Uy Vx = 0*0 - (-1)*(-1) = 0 - 1 = -1\\nSo normal N = (-1,-1,-1)\\nPlane equation: N · (X - B) = 0 → (-1,-1,-1) · (x-1,y-1,z-0) = 0 → - (x-1) - (y-1) - z = 0 → -x+1 -y+1 -z =0 → -x -y -z +2=0 → x+y+z=2\\nNow, point A(0,0,0): 0+0+0=0 <2\\nPoint E(1,1,1):1+1+1=3>2\\nSo A and E are on opposite sides of the plane BCD.\\nSince the tetrahedron ABCD has A on one side, and the face BCD, so for the tetrahedron, the interior is where x+y+z ≤2? At B,C,D it's 2, A is 0<2, so yes, the half-space x+y+z ≤2 contains the tetrahedron.\\nE has x+y+z=3>2, so E is on the other side.\\nTherefore, when we add E, it will replace the face BCD with three new faces: BCE, CDE, DBE or something.\\nSpecifically, the new convex hull will have E connected to B,C,D, and the face BCD is removed.\\nSo the new polyhedron has vertices A,B,C,D,E, and faces: triangle ABC, ABD, ACD, and then triangles BCE, CDE, DBE, and also triangle ABE? Not necessarily.\\nActually, the faces should be: since A is still there, and E is added, likely the faces are:\\n- triangle ABC\\n- triangle ABD\\n- triangle ACD\\n- triangle BCE\\n- triangle CDE\\n- triangle DBE\\n- and triangle ABE? But that might not be.\\nNote that points A,B,E: A(0,0,0), B(1,1,0), E(1,1,1)\\nSimilarly, A,C,E; A,D,E.\\nBut also B,C,E etc.\\nTo find volume, we can compute the volume as the sum of volumes of three tetrahedrons: for example, tetrahedron A,B,C,E; tetrahedron A,C,D,E; and tetrahedron A,B,D,E, but they overlap on tetrahedron A,C,E and A,B,E, etc.\\nBetter: since the polyhedron can be divided into tetrahedron A,B,C,D and tetrahedron B,C,D,E, but they share the face B,C,D, and since E is on the other side, and A on one side, but in the convex hull, the region between is filled, but actually, tetrahedron A,B,C,D and tetrahedron B,C,D,E intersect only on the face, so their union is a polyhedron with vertices A,B,C,D,E, and if they are glued on BCD, then the volume is vol(ABCD) + vol(BCDE).\\nIs that correct? Only if the two tetrahedrons are on opposite sides and their union is convex, which in this case, since the dihedral angle might be such, but let's check.\\nVol(ABCD) = 1/3 as before.\\nVol(BCDE): earlier we computed with B as origin, but let's compute properly.\\nTetrahedron B,C,D,E: points B(1,1,0), C(1,0,1), D(0,1,1), E(1,1,1)\\nSet B as origin: vectors BC=(0,-1,1), BD=(-1,0,1), BE=(0,0,1)\\nScalar triple product BC · (BD × BE)\\nBD × BE = (-1,0,1) × (0,0,1) = i(0*1 - 1*0) - j( -1*1 - 1*0 ) + k( -1*0 - 0*0 ) = i(0) - j(-1) + k(0) = (0,1,0)\\nThen BC · (0,1,0) = (0,-1,1) · (0,1,0) = -1\\nAbs value 1, so volume = (1/6)*1 = 1/6\\nSo total volume = vol(ABCD) + vol(BCDE) = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2\\nIs this correct? Is the union of tetrahedron ABCD and tetrahedron BCDE equal to the convex hull of A,B,C,D,E?\\nTetrahedron ABCD has points with x+y+z ≤2, and tetrahedron BCDE has points B,C,D,E.\\nE is (1,1,1), x+y+z=3>2.\\nThe face BCD is common.\\nNow, is every point in the convex hull covered? For example, the point E is in BCDE, A is in ABCD.\\nWhat about the line segment from A to E? Does it pass through both? The midpoint of A and E is (0.5,0.5,0.5), which has x+y+z=1.5<2, so it's in the half-space of ABCD, but is it in tetrahedron ABCD?\\nTetrahedron A,B,C,D: we can check if (0.5,0.5,0.5) is inside.\\nBarycentric coordinates: solve sA + tB + uC + vD = (0.5,0.5,0.5) with s+t+u+v=1, s,t,u,v≥0.\\nA=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1)\\nSo:\\nx: t*1 + u*1 + v*0 = t + u = 0.5\\ny: t*1 + u*0 + v*1 = t + v = 0.5\\nz: t*0 + u*1 + v*1 = u + v = 0.5\\nAnd s + t + u + v =1\\nFrom first three: t+u=0.5, t+v=0.5, u+v=0.5\\nAdd all three: 2t+2u+2v=1.5 → t+u+v=0.75\\nThen s=1 - (t+u+v)=1-0.75=0.25\\nNow t+u=0.5, t+v=0.5, subtract: u-v=0 → u=v\\nThen u+v=0.5 → 2u=0.5 → u=0.25, v=0.25\\nThen t+u=0.5 → t+0.25=0.5 → t=0.25\\nAll positive, so yes, (0.5,0.5,0.5) is in tetrahedron ABCD.\\nNow, is it in tetrahedron BCDE? Tetrahedron B,C,D,E: points B(1,1,0), C(1,0,1), D(0,1,1), E(1,1,1)\\nSet coordinates: let P = aB + bC + cD + dE, a+b+c+d=1, a,b,c,d≥0\\nP=(0.5,0.5,0.5)\\nx: a*1 + b*1 + c*0 + d*1 = a + b + d = 0.5\\ny: a*1 + b*0 + c*1 + d*1 = a + c + d = 0.5\\nz: a*0 + b*1 + c*1 + d*1 = b + c + d = 0.5\\nSum: (a+b+d) + (a+c+d) + (b+c+d) = 2a+2b+2c+3d = 1.5\\nBut a+b+c+d=1, so 2(a+b+c+d) + d = 2*1 + d = 2 + d = 1.5? Then d= -0.5 <0, impossible.\\nSo (0.5,0.5,0.5) not in BCDE.\\nNow, the line segment from A to E: A is in ABCD, E is in BCDE, but the segment crosses the face BCD? At what point?\\nThe plane BCD is x+y+z=2.\\nParametrize A to E: from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1), so point t(1,1,1), t in [0,1]\\nx+y+z=3t=2 → t=2/3\\nPoint (2/3,2/3,2/3)\\nIs this on face BCD? Face BCD is triangle with B(1,1,0), C(1,0,1), D(0,1,1)\\nCheck if (2/3,2/3,2/3) is in the triangle.\\nBarycentric coordinates for triangle BCD.\\nLet Q = pB + qC + rD, p+q+r=1, p,q,r≥0\\nx: p*1 + q*1 + r*0 = p + q = 2/3\\ny: p*1 + q*0 + r*1 = p + r = 2/3\\nz: p*0 + q*1 + r*1 = q + r = 2/3\\nThen p+q=2/3, p+r=2/3, q+r=2/3\\nAdd all: 2p+2q+2r=2 → p+q+r=1\\nBut from p+q=2/3, then r=1 - (p+q)=1-2/3=1/3\\nSimilarly, p=1 - (q+r)=1-2/3=1/3? From p+r=2/3, p+1/3=2/3 → p=1/3\\nq=1 - (p+r)=1-1/3-1/3=1/3? From p+q=2/3, 1/3+q=2/3 → q=1/3\\nThen q+r=1/3+1/3=2/3, good.\\nSo p=q=r=1/3, so yes, (2/3,2/3,2/3) is the centroid of triangle BCD, so on the face.\\nTherefore, the line segment AE intersects the face BCD at (2/3,2/3,2/3).\\nNow, in the union of tetrahedrons ABCD and BCDE, the segment AE is partly in ABCD (from A to the point) and partly? From the point to E: but E is in BCDE, but is the segment from (2/3,2/3,2/3) to E in BCDE?\\nBCDE is tetrahedron with vertices B,C,D,E, and (2/3,2/3,2/3) is on face BCD, E is vertex, so yes, the segment is in the tetrahedron BCDE.\\nMoreover, since they share only the face, the union is convex? Actually, the union of two tetrahedrons sharing a face is a polyhedron, and in this case, since they are on opposite sides, but in 3D, if they are glued on a face, the union is convex only if the dihedral angle is less than 180, but here, since A and E are on opposite sides of the plane, the union should be convex.\\nIn fact, the convex hull of the five points should contain both tetrahedrons, and since any point in the convex hull can be written as convex combination, and the union covers all, actually, yes, the convex hull is exactly the union of tetrahedron ABCD and tetrahedron BCDE, glued along face BCD.\\nTherefore, volume is vol(ABCD) + vol(BCDE) = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2.\\nBut is that possible? The cube has volume 1, and this polyhedron is inside the cube? Points are vertices, so yes, but volume 1/2 seems large.\\nCheck if all points are within cube: yes.\\nNow, is there any point outside? No.\\nBut volume 1/2: let me verify with another method.\\nWe can compute the volume by dividing into other tetrahedrons.\\nFor example, take tetrahedron A,B,C,E.\\nPoints A(0,0,0), B(1,1,0), C(1,0,1), E(1,1,1)\\nVectors AB=(1,1,0), AC=(1,0,1), AE=(1,1,1)\\nAB × AC = (1,1,0) × (1,0,1) = i(1*1 - 0*0) - j(1*1 - 0*1) + k(1*0 - 1*1) = i(1) - j(1) + k(-1) = (1,-1,-1)\\nThen AE · (1,-1,-1) = (1,1,1) · (1,-1,-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1\\nAbs value 1, volume = (1/6)*1 = 1/6\\nSimilarly, tetrahedron A,C,D,E: A(0,0,0), C(1,0,1), D(0,1,1), E(1,1,1)\\nAC=(1,0,1), AD=(0,1,1), AE=(1,1,1)\\nAC × AD = (1,0,1) × (0,1,1) = i(0*1 - 1*1) - j(1*1 - 1*0) + k(1*1 - 0*0) = i(-1) - j(1) + k(1) = (-1,-1,1)\\nAE · (-1,-1,1) = (1,1,1) · (-1,-1,1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1, abs 1, vol=1/6\\nTetrahedron A,B,D,E: A(0,0,0), B(1,1,0), D(0,1,1), E(1,1,1)\\nAB=(1,1,0), AD=(0,1,1), AE=(1,1,1)\\nAB × AD = (1,1,0) × (0,1,1) = i(1*1 - 0*1) - j(1*1 - 0*0) + k(1*1 - 1*0) = i(1) - j(1) + k(1) = (1,-1,1)\\nAE · (1,-1,1) = (1,1,1)·(1,-1,1)=1-1+1=1, abs 1, vol=1/6\\nNow, if I add these three: 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/2, same as before.\\nBut do they cover the whole polyhedron without overlap? Each pair shares a face: for example, A,B,C,E and A,C,D,E share face A,C,E.\\nBut in the polyhedron, the face A,C,E might be internal? In our earlier division, we had ABCD and BCDE, which includes points not in these.\\nActually, these three tetrahedrons: A,B,C,E; A,C,D,E; A,B,D,E.\\nTheir union: each includes A and E, and pairs.\\nBut do they include the point D? In A,C,D,E and A,B,D,E.\\nBut what about the region near B,C,D? For example, the point (1,1,0)=B is in A,B,C,E and A,B,D,E.\\nBut is the tetrahedron B,C,D covered? For example, the centroid of B,C,D is ( (1+1+0)/3, (1+0+1)/3, (0+1+1)/3 ) = (2/3,2/3,2/3)\\nIs this in any of the three tetrahedrons?\\nCheck in A,B,C,E: points A(0,0,0), B(1,1,0), C(1,0,1), E(1,1,1)\\nCan (2/3,2/3,2/3) be written as convex combination?\\nLet pA + qB + rC + sE = (2/3,2/3,2/3), p+q+r+s=1\\nx: q*1 + r*1 + s*1 = q+r+s = 2/3\\ny: q*1 + r*0 + s*1 = q + s = 2/3\\nz: q*0 + r*1 + s*1 = r + s = 2/3\\nAnd p=1 - (q+r+s)=1-2/3=1/3\\nFrom y: q+s=2/3\\nFrom z: r+s=2/3\\nFrom x: q+r+s=2/3\\nBut q+r+s = (q+s) + r = 2/3 + r = 2/3 → r=0\\nThen from r+s=2/3, s=2/3\\nq+s=2/3 → q+2/3=2/3 → q=0\\nThen p=1/3\\nSo (1/3,0,0,2/3), but r=0, so coefficients p=1/3, q=0, r=0, s=2/3\\nBut r=0, so it's on the face A,E, but specifically, since r=0, it's in the triangle A,B,E? But B has coefficient q=0, so actually on edge A-E? \\nPoint: (1/3)A + (2/3)E = (1/3)(0,0,0) + (2/3)(1,1,1) = (2/3,2/3,2/3), yes.\\nBut in the tetrahedron A,B,C,E, with coefficients, but we have q=0,r=0, so it's on the edge A-E, which is part of the tetrahedron.\\nSimilarly, it might be in other tetrahedrons.\\nBut the point (2/3,2/3,2/3) is on the edge A-E, which is shared.\\nNow, but in this division into three tetrahedrons, they all contain the edge A-E, and they cover the space, but do they cover the entire polyhedron?\\nFor example, the point B(1,1,0): in A,B,C,E: set pA+qB+rC+sE=B, so q=1, others 0.\\nSimilarly, C in A,B,C,E and A,C,D,E.\\nD in A,C,D,E and A,B,D,E.\\nE in all.\\nNow, a point like the centroid of A,B,C: ((0+1+1)/3, (0+1+0)/3, (0+0+1)/3)=(2/3,1/3,1/3)\\nIn A,B,C,E: solve pA+qB+rC+sE=(2/3,1/3,1/3)\\nx: q + r + s = 2/3\\ny: q + s = 1/3? y-coordinate: q*1 + r*0 + s*1 = q + s\\nSet to 1/3\\nz: r + s = 1/3\\np+q+r+s=1\\nFrom y: q+s=1/3\\nz: r+s=1/3\\nx: q+r+s=2/3\\nBut q+r+s = (q+s) + r = 1/3 + r = 2/3 → r=1/3\\nThen r+s=1/3 → 1/3 + s=1/3 → s=0\\nq+s=1/3 → q=1/3\\nThen p=1 - (q+r+s)=1-1/3-1/3-0=1/3\\nSo p=1/3,q=1/3,r=1/3,s=0, so in A,B,C,E.\\nSimilarly, other points.\\nNow, is there any point in the original polyhedron not covered? For example, a point near D, but should be covered.\\nMoreover, the three tetrahedrons: A,B,C,E; A,C,D,E; A,B,D,E.\\nThey all share the edge A-E.\\nThe union: notice that they cover the regions, but do they overlap only on faces?\\nFor example, the tetrahedron A,B,C,E and A,B,D,E share the face A,B,E.\\nSimilarly, A,B,C,E and A,C,D,E share face A,C,E.\\nA,B,D,E and A,C,D,E share face A,D,E.\\nAnd the three meet at A-E.\\nNow, is the entire convex hull covered? The convex hull should also include points like the centroid of B,C,D, but we saw it's on A-E, which is included.\\nBut what about a point inside, say average of B,C,D,E: ( (1+1+0+1)/4, (1+0+1+1)/4, (0+1+1+1)/4 ) = (3/4,3/4,3/4)\\nIs this in any of the three?\\nCheck in A,B,C,E: pA+qB+rC+sE=(3/4,3/4,3/4)\\nx: q + r + s = 3/4\\ny: q + s = 3/4\\nz: r + s = 3/4\\np+q+r+s=1\\nFrom y: q+s=3/4\\nFrom z: r+s=3/4\\nFrom x: q+r+s=3/4\\nThen q+r+s = (q+s) + r = 3/4 + r = 3/4 → r=0\\nThen r+s=3/4 → s=3/4\\nq+s=3/4 → q+3/4=3/4 → q=0\\nThen p=1 - (0+0+3/4)=1/4\\nSo (1/4,0,0,3/4), so on A-E.\\nSimilarly, it's on the edge.\\nNow, a point not on edges, say (1,0.5,0.5)\\nIs this in the convex hull? Probably.\\nCheck if in one of the tetrahedrons.\\nSay in A,B,C,E: solve pA+qB+rC+sE=(1,0.5,0.5)\\nx: q + r + s =1\\ny: q + s =0.5\\nz: r + s =0.5\\np+q+r+s=1\\nFrom y and z: q+s=0.5, r+s=0.5\\nx: q+r+s=1\\nBut q+r+s = (q+s) + r = 0.5 + r =1 → r=0.5\\nThen r+s=0.5 → 0.5 + s=0.5 → s=0\\nq+s=0.5 → q=0.5\\nThen p=1 - (0.5+0.5+0)=0\\nSo p=0,q=0.5,r=0.5,s=0, so it's on the edge B-C.\\nSimilarly, other points.\\nSo actually, the three tetrahedrons cover the entire polyhedron, and they overlap only on faces (like triangles A,B,E; A,C,E; A,D,E and edges), so the volume adds up: 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/2.\\nEarlier with two tetrahedrons: ABCD and BCDE, vol 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2, same.\\nSo volume is 1/2.\\nBut is this the maximum?\\nWe have volume 1/2.\\nIs there a larger one?\\nFor example, if we take five points including more spread.\\nSuppose we take a different set.\\nFor example, take all points except three that are on a face.\\nSay, leave out three points of a face, but a face has four points.\\nLeave out three points that are not on a face.\\nMaximum possible: the cube has volume 1, so cannot exceed 1.\\nCan we get more than 1/2?\\nSuppose we take the five points: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,1)\\nSo one corner and its three neighbors and the opposite corner.\\nPoints: A=(0,0,0), B=(1,0,0), C=(0,1,0), D=(0,0,1), E=(1,1,1)\\nNow, convex hull.\\nThis might be a square pyramid or something.\\nNote that A,B,C,D are not coplanar; they form a tetrahedron.\\nVolume of tetrahedron A,B,C,D: A(0,0,0), B(1,0,0), C(0,1,0), D(0,0,1)\\nAB=(1,0,0), AC=(0,1,0), AD=(0,0,1)\\nAB × AC = (1,0,0) × (0,1,0) = (0*0-0*1, -(1*0-0*0), 1*1-0*0) = (0,0,1)\\nAD · (0,0,1) = (0,0,1)·(0,0,1)=1, vol=(1/6)*1=1/6\\nNow add E(1,1,1)\\nNow, similar to before, find which face is visible.\\nPlane of B,C,D: B(1,0,0), C(0,1,0), D(0,0,1)\\nVectors BC=(-1,1,0), BD=(-1,0,1)\\nBC × BD = i(1*1 - 0*0) - j( -1*1 - 0*(-1) ) + k( -1*0 - 1*(-1) ) = i(1) - j(-1) + k(1) = (1,1,1)\\nPlane: (1,1,1)·(X-B)=0 → (x-1)+(y-0)+(z-0)=0 → x+y+z=1\\nA(0,0,0):0<1, E(1,1,1):3>1, so opposite sides.\\nTetrahedron A,B,C,D has A on side x+y+z≤1? At A:0<1, B:1+0+0=1, etc., so yes.\\nE has 3>1, so outside.\\nNow, the face BCD is visible from E.\\nVol of tetrahedron B,C,D,E: B(1,0,0), C(0,1,0), D(0,0,1), E(1,1,1)\\nSet B: BC=(-1,1,0), BD=(-1,0,1), BE=(0,1,1)\\nBC × BD = (-1,1,0) × (-1,0,1) = i(1*1 - 0*0) - j( -1*1 - 0*(-1) ) + k( -1*0 - 1*(-1) ) = i(1) - j(-1) + k(1) = (1,1,1)\\nBE · (1,1,1) = (0,1,1)·(1,1,1)=0+1+1=2, abs 2, vol=(1/6)*2=1/3\\nThen total volume = vol(ABCD) + vol(BCDE) = 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/6 + 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2\\nSame as before.\\nAnother configuration: suppose we take a regular pentagon, but in cube, hard.\\nOr take four points of a face and the opposite corner, but earlier we had volume 1/3.\\nWorse.\\nCan we get more than 1/2?\\nSuppose we try to include points that are more spread.\\nNote that in both cases we got 1/2.\\nIs 1/2 achievable? Yes, as above.\\nCan we get higher?\\nSuppose we take five points: say (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), and (1,0,0)\\nBut (1,0,0) might be inside.\\nIn previous optimal, we had volume 1/2.\\nNote that the maximum volume polyhedron with 5 vertices in the cube.\\nI recall that the maximum is indeed 1/2.\\nAnother way: the convex hull volume is maximized when the points are in symmetric positions.\\nIn the first configuration we had: A(0,0,0), B(1,1,0), C(1,0,1), D(0,1,1), E(1,1,1)\\nThis is symmetric.\\nVolume 1/2.\\nIs there a configuration with volume larger?\\nSuppose we take (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,1) — we did, got 1/2.\\nOr take (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (0,0,1)\\nBut (0,0,1) might be redundant.\\nPoints: A(0,0,0), B(1,1,0), C(1,0,1), D(0,1,1), F(0,0,1)\\nNow, F(0,0,1)\\nNote that D(0,1,1), F(0,0,1), so on the face x=0.\\nLikely F is inside or on boundary.\\nFor example, the tetrahedron A,B,C,D has volume 1/3, and F(0,0,1) — is it inside?\\nCheck against planes.\\nBut likely the convex hull might be smaller.\\nSince we have multiple configurations giving 1/2, and 1/2 is half the cube, probably it's the maximum.\\nTo confirm, suppose the maximum is at least 1/2, and since the cube is convex, the volume cannot exceed 1, but 1/2 seems plausible.\\nAnother configuration: take all vertices except three that are mutually adjacent, but we did.\\nOr take a path.\\nBut likely 1/2 is the max.\\nSo for problem 2, maximum volume is 1/2.\\n\\nBut in the square pyramid, we had only 1/3, but now we have 1/2.\\nSo answer should be 1/2.\\n\\nNow back to problem 1: we have n=1,13,43,91,157.\\nBut the problem asks for \"all n\", so we need to list them.\\nProbably in order.\\nSo n=1,13,43,91,157.\\n\\nNow, to box the answers.\\n\\nProblem 1: the solutions are 1,13,43,91,157.\\nProblem 2: 1/2.\\n\\nIn JSON format.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1,13,43,91,157\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/2\"\n}",
