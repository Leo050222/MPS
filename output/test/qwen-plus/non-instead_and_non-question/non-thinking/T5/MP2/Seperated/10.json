Then $ f(cx) = c^3 $ for all $ x $.\\n\\nSo if $ c \\\\ne 0 $, then $ f $ is constant on $ \\\\mathbb{R} $, since $ cx $ spans $ \\\\mathbb{R} $. So $ f \\\\equiv c^3 $.\\n\\nBut also $ f(0) = c $, so $ c = c^3 \\\\Rightarrow c^3 - c = 0 \\\\Rightarrow c(c^2 - 1) = 0 $, so $ c = 0, 1, -1 $.\\n\\nIf $ c \\\\ne 0 $, then $ f $ is constant $ c^3 $, and $ f(0) = c $, so $ c = c^3 $. So possible constants: $ f \\\\equiv 1 $ or $ f \\\\equiv -1 $ (since $ c = 1 \\\\Rightarrow f \\\\equiv 1 $; $ c = -1 \\\\Rightarrow f \\\\equiv (-1)^3 = -1 $).\\n\\nCheck constant functions:\\n\\nTry $ f(x) = 0 $ for all $ x $: LHS: $ f(x\\\\cdot 0 + y^3) = f(y^3) = 0 $; RHS: $ y\\\\cdot 0 + 0^3 = 0 $. OK.\\n\\nTry $ f(x) = 1 $: LHS: $ f(x\\\\cdot 1 + y^3) = f(x + y^3) = 1 $; RHS: $ y\\\\cdot 1 + 1^3 = y + 1 $. Not equal unless $ y = 0 $. Not valid.\\n\\nTry $ f(x) = -1 $: LHS: $ f(-x + y^3) = -1 $; RHS: $ y(-1) + (-1)^3 = -y -1 $. Only equal if $ -1 = -y -1 \\\\Rightarrow y = 0 $. Not valid.\\n\\nSo only constant solution is $ f \\\\equiv 0 $.\\n\\nBut earlier, when $ c = f(0) \\\\ne 0 $, we got contradiction unless constant, but constants other than 0 don't work. So $ c = 0 $, i.e., $ f(0) = 0 $.\\n\\nSo now $ f(0) = 0 $.\\n\\nStep 2: Try $ x = 0 $:\\n\\n$$\\nf(0 \\\\cdot f(y) + y^3) = y f(0) + f(y)^3 \\\\Rightarrow f(y^3) = 0 + f(y)^3 \\\\Rightarrow f(y^3) = f(y)^3. \\\\quad (*)\\n$$\\n\\nSo this holds for all $ y $.\\n\\nStep 3: Try $ y = 1 $:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x f(1) + 1) = 1 \\\\cdot f(x) + f(1)^3.\\n$$\\n\\nLet $ a = f(1) $. Then:\\n\\n$$\\nf(a x + 1) = f(x) + a^3. \\\\quad (1)\\n$$\\n\\nCase 1: $ a = 0 $, i.e., $ f(1) = 0 $.\\n\\nThen (1) becomes $ f(1) = f(x) + 0 \\\\Rightarrow f(x) = 0 $ for all $ x $? No: left side is $ f(0\\\\cdot x + 1) = f(1) = 0 $, right side is $ f(x) + 0 $, so $ 0 = f(x) $. So $ f \\\\equiv 0 $.\\n\\nWe already saw this works.\\n\\nSo one solution: $ f \\\\equiv 0 $.\\n\\nCase 2: $ a \\\\ne 0 $.\\n\\nThen from (1): $ f(ax + 1) = f(x) + a^3 $.\\n\\nThis suggests a recursive relation.\\n\\nAlso from (*), $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $.\\n\\nNow try $ y = -1 $:\\n\\nFrom original: $ f(x f(-1) + (-1)^3) = (-1) f(x) + f(-1)^3 $\\n\\n$ \\\\Rightarrow f(x f(-1) - 1) = -f(x) + f(-1)^3 $.\\n\\nLet $ b = f(-1) $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nf(b x - 1) = -f(x) + b^3. \\\\quad (2)\\n$$\\n\\nNow suppose $ f $ is not identically zero. Then $ a = f(1) \\\\ne 0 $.\\n\\nGo back to (1): $ f(ax + 1) = f(x) + a^3 $.\\n\\nApply again: $ f(a(ax+1) + 1) = f(ax+1) + a^3 = f(x) + 2a^3 $\\n\\ni.e., $ f(a^2x + a + 1) = f(x) + 2a^3 $\\n\\nSimilarly, $ f(a^n x + \\\\cdots ) = f(x) + n a^3 $, suggesting unboundedness unless $ a^3 = 0 $, but $ a \\\\ne 0 $, so unless $ a^3 = 0 $, which it isn't, $ f $ can grow linearly in iterations.\\n\\nBut maybe $ f $ is linear? Try assuming $ f(x) = kx $.\\n\\nAssume $ f(x) = kx $. Then LHS: $ f(x f(y) + y^3) = f(x(ky) + y^3) = f(kxy + y^3) = k(kxy + y^3) = k^2 x y + k y^3 $\\n\\nRHS: $ y f(x) + f(y)^3 = y(kx) + (ky)^3 = kxy + k^3 y^3 $\\n\\nSet equal: $ k^2 x y + k y^3 = k x y + k^3 y^3 $\\n\\nFor all $ x,y $, so compare coefficients:\\n\\n- Coefficient of $ xy $: $ k^2 = k \\\\Rightarrow k(k-1)=0 $\\n- Coefficient of $ y^3 $: $ k = k^3 \\\\Rightarrow k^3 - k = 0 \\\\Rightarrow k(k^2 - 1) = 0 $\\n\\nSo $ k = 0 $ or $ k = 1 $ from first, and $ k = 0,1,-1 $ from second.\\n\\nCommon solutions: $ k = 0 $ or $ k = 1 $.\\n\\n$ k=0 $: gives $ f \\\\equiv 0 $, already have.\\n\\n$ k=1 $: $ f(x) = x $. Check:\\n\\nLHS: $ f(x f(y) + y^3) = f(x y + y^3) = x y + y^3 $\\n\\nRHS: $ y f(x) + f(y)^3 = y x + y^3 $. Equal! So $ f(x) = x $ is a solution.\\n\\nNow check $ f(-1) $: if $ f(x)=x $, then $ b = -1 $, and equation (2): $ f(bx -1) = f(-x -1) = -x -1 $; RHS: $ -f(x) + b^3 = -x + (-1)^3 = -x -1 $. OK.\\n\\nSo $ f(x) = x $ works.\\n\\nAre there others?\\n\\nWe have $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $. If $ f(x) = x $, this is $ y^3 = (y)^3 $, OK.\\n\\nNow suppose $ f $ is injective?\\n\\nTry to see if we can show injectivity.\\n\\nSuppose $ f(a) = f(b) $. Can we show $ a = b $?\\n\\nNot obvious.\\n\\nTry $ x = 1 $ in original:\\n\\n$$\\nf(f(y) + y^3) = y f(1) + f(y)^3 = a y + f(y)^3.\\n$$\\n\\nBut from (*), $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $, so RHS is $ a y + f(y^3) $.\\n\\nNot sure.\\n\\nBack to equation (1): $ f(a x + 1) = f(x) + a^3 $ with $ a = f(1) $\\n\\nSuppose $ a = 1 $. Then $ f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1 $\\n\\nThen by induction, $ f(x + n) = f(x) + n $ for integers $ n $.\\n\\nAlso, from (*): $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $\\n\\nTry $ y = 2 $: $ f(8) = f(2)^3 $\\n\\nBut if $ f(x+1) = f(x)+1 $, then $ f(n) = f(0) + n = n $, since $ f(0)=0 $.\\n\\nSo $ f(n) = n $ for all integers $ n $.\\n\\nThen $ f(8) = 8 $, and $ f(2)^3 = 2^3 = 8 $, so OK.\\n\\nSimilarly, for any integer $ k $, $ f(k^3) = k^3 $, $ f(k)^3 = k^3 $, so consistent.\\n\\nNow, what about rationals?\\n\\nSet $ y = 2 $ in original:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x f(2) + 8) = 2 f(x) + f(2)^3\\n$$\\n\\nBut $ f(2) = 2 $, $ f(2)^3 = 8 $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nf(2x + 8) = 2 f(x) + 8\\n$$\\n\\nIf we assume $ f(x) = x $, then LHS: $ 2x + 8 $, RHS: $ 2x + 8 $, good.\\n\\nBut suppose we don't know.\\n\\nWe have $ f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 $, so $ f $ is determined by values on [0,1), but we need more.\\n\\nTry to show $ f $ is additive or something.\\n\\nAnother idea: suppose we set $ x $ such that $ x f(y) + y^3 = 0 $, then LHS is $ f(0) = 0 $, so:\\n\\n$ 0 = y f(x) + f(y)^3 $\\n\\nBut $ x = -y^3 / f(y) $, provided $ f(y) \\\\ne 0 $.\\n\\nSo if $ f(y) \\\\ne 0 $, then $ x = -y^3 / f(y) $, and\\n\\n$ 0 = y f\\\\left( -\\\\frac{y^3}{f(y)} \\\\right) + f(y)^3 $\\n\\nSo $ y f\\\\left( -\\\\frac{y^3}{f(y)} \\\\right) = - f(y)^3 $\\n\\nThus, if $ y \\\\ne 0 $, $ f\\\\left( -\\\\frac{y^3}{f(y)} \\\\right) = - \\\\frac{f(y)^3}{y} $\\n\\nBut from (*), $ f(y)^3 = f(y^3) $, so\\n\\n$ f\\\\left( -\\\\frac{y^3}{f(y)} \\\\right) = - \\\\frac{f(y^3)}{y} $\\n\\nNot sure.\\n\\nBack to case where $ a = f(1) = 1 $. We have $ f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 $.\\n\\nNow try $ y = -1 $: $ f(x f(-1) - 1) = -f(x) + f(-1)^3 $\\n\\nLet $ b = f(-1) $. Since $ f(-1 + 1) = f(0) = 0 = f(-1) + 1 $? From $ f(x+1) = f(x)+1 $, set $ x = -1 $: $ f(0) = f(-1) + 1 \\\\Rightarrow 0 = b + 1 \\\\Rightarrow b = -1 $.\\n\\nSo $ f(-1) = -1 $.\\n\\nThen equation: $ f(-x -1) = -f(x) + (-1)^3 = -f(x) -1 $\\n\\nBut from $ f(x+1) = f(x)+1 $, $ f(-x -1) = f( -(x+1) ) $\\n\\nAnd $ f(-(x+1)) = ? $ Not known.\\n\\nBut from above, $ f(-x -1) = -f(x) -1 $\\n\\nSet $ z = x+1 $, then $ f(-z) = -f(z-1) -1 $\\n\\nBut $ f(z-1) = f(z) - 1 $, so $ f(-z) = - (f(z) - 1) - 1 = -f(z) +1 -1 = -f(z) $\\n\\nSo $ f(-z) = -f(z) $. So $ f $ is odd.\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nNow we have $ f $ is odd, $ f(x+1) = f(x)+1 $, $ f(0)=0 $, $ f(n)=n $ for integers.\\n\\nNow use $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $\\n\\nSuppose $ y = \\\\frac{p}{q} $, rational.\\n\\nBut perhaps assume $ f $ is linear. We already have $ f(x)=x $ as solution.\\n\\nIs there another?\\n\\nSuppose $ f(x) = x $ for all $ x $, works.\\n\\nWhat if $ a = f(1) \\\\ne 1 $? Earlier we had case $ a \\\\ne 0 $, but not necessarily 1.\\n\\nFrom (1): $ f(a x + 1) = f(x) + a^3 $\\n\\nSuppose $ a \\\\ne 1 $.\\n\\nAlso, from $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $\\n\\nSet $ y = 1 $: $ f(1) = f(1)^3 \\\\Rightarrow a = a^3 \\\\Rightarrow a^3 - a = 0 \\\\Rightarrow a(a-1)(a+1)=0 $\\n\\nBut $ a \\\\ne 0 $, so $ a = 1 $ or $ a = -1 $\\n\\nWe did $ a=1 $, now try $ a = -1 $\\n\\nSo $ f(1) = -1 $\\n\\nThen from (1): $ f(-x + 1) = f(x) + (-1)^3 = f(x) - 1 $\\n\\nAlso, $ f(0) = 0 $\\n\\nSet $ x=0 $: $ f(1) = f(0) - 1 = -1 $, yes.\\n\\nSet $ x=1 $: $ f(-1 + 1) = f(1) - 1 \\\\Rightarrow f(0) = -1 -1 = -2 $, but $ f(0)=0 $, contradiction!\\n\\nSo $ a = -1 $ impossible.\\n\\nThus only possibilities: $ a = 0 $ or $ a = 1 $\\n\\n$ a=0 $ leads to $ f \\\\equiv 0 $\\n\\n$ a=1 $ leads to $ f(x+1) = f(x)+1 $, $ f $ odd, $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $\\n\\nNow, can we show $ f(x) = x $ for all $ x $?\\n\\nUse the original equation.\\n\\nSet $ x = 1 $:\\n\\n$$\\nf(f(y) + y^3) = y f(1) + f(y)^3 = y \\\\cdot 1 + f(y)^3 = y + f(y)^3\\n$$\\n\\nBut $ f(y)^3 = f(y^3) $, so\\n\\n$$\\nf(f(y) + y^3) = y + f(y^3)\\n$$\\n\\nNow, if we let $ z = y^3 $, then $ y = z^{1/3} $, but messy.\\n\\nSuppose we assume $ f $ is additive.\\n\\nAnother idea: set $ y = x $ in original?\\n\\nNot helpful.\\n\\nTry to show $ f $ is multiplicative or something.\\n\\nSuppose we consider $ f $ on cubes.\\n\\nSince $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $, and $ f $ satisfies Cauchy-like equations.\\n\\nWe have $ f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 $, so $ f(x+n) = f(x) + n $ for integers $ n $.\\n\\nAlso, $ f $ is odd.\\n\\nNow, let us find $ f(2) $. Since $ f(1) = 1 $, $ f(2) = f(1+1) = f(1)+1 = 2 $\\n\\nSimilarly, $ f(3)=3 $, etc.\\n\\nNow, what about $ f(1/2) $? Let $ u = f(1/2) $\\n\\nFrom $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $, set $ y = 1/2 $: $ f(1/8) = u^3 $\\n\\nAlso, $ f(1/8) = f(1/2 - 3/8) $? Not helpful.\\n\\nNote that $ f(1/8 + 8) = f(1/8) + 8 $, but $ f(65/8) = f(1/8) + 8 $\\n\\nBut not useful.\\n\\nUse the original equation with specific values.\\n\\nSet $ x = y $:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x f(x) + x^3) = x f(x) + f(x)^3\\n$$\\n\\nLet $ u = f(x) $, then $ f(x u + x^3) = x u + u^3 $\\n\\nBut $ x u + x^3 = x(u + x^2) $\\n\\nNot sure.\\n\\nSet $ y = 2 $:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x f(2) + 8) = 2 f(x) + f(2)^3\\n$$\\n\\n$ f(2) = 2 $, so $ f(2x + 8) = 2 f(x) + 8 $\\n\\nNow, since $ f(x+1) = f(x)+1 $, we can write $ f(x) = x + p(x) $ where $ p $ is periodic with period 1.\\n\\nLet $ f(x) = x + p(x) $, with $ p(x+1) = p(x) $, and $ p(0) = f(0) - 0 = 0 $\\n\\nAlso $ f $ odd: $ f(-x) = -f(x) \\\\Rightarrow -x + p(-x) = - (x + p(x)) = -x - p(x) \\\\Rightarrow p(-x) = -p(x) $, so $ p $ is odd.\\n\\nNow plug into $ f(2x + 8) = 2 f(x) + 8 $\\n\\nLeft: $ f(2x+8) = 2x+8 + p(2x+8) $\\n\\nRight: $ 2(x + p(x)) + 8 = 2x + 2p(x) + 8 $\\n\\nSo $ 2x+8 + p(2x+8) = 2x + 2p(x) + 8 \\\\Rightarrow p(2x+8) = 2p(x) $\\n\\nBut $ p $ is periodic with period 1, so $ p(2x+8) = p(2x) $ since 8 is integer.\\n\\nSo $ p(2x) = 2p(x) $\\n\\nSimilarly, from $ f(y^3) = f(y)^3 $\\n\\nLeft: $ f(y^3) = y^3 + p(y^3) $\\n\\nRight: $ f(y)^3 = (y + p(y))^3 = y^3 + 3y^2 p(y) + 3y p(y)^2 + p(y)^3 $\\n\\nSo $ y^3 + p(y^3) = y^3 + 3y^2 p(y) + 3y p(y)^2 + p(y)^3 $\\n\\nThus $ p(y^3) = 3y^2 p(y) + 3y p(y)^2 + p(y)^3 $\\n\\nBut $ p $ is periodic, bounded if continuous, but no continuity assumed.\\n\\nHowever, $ p(2x) = 2p(x) $\\n\\nIterate: $ p(4x) = p(2*(2x)) = 2 p(2x) = 4 p(x) $\\n\\n$ p(8x) = 8 p(x) $, etc. $ p(2^n x) = 2^n p(x) $\\n\\nBut $ p $ is periodic with period 1, so $ |p(z)| \\\\leq M $ for some M for all z, since periodic.\\n\\nBut $ |p(2^n x)| = 2^n |p(x)| \\\\leq M $ for all n, so unless $ p(x) = 0 $, this grows without bound.\\n\\nThus $ p(x) = 0 $ for all x.\\n\\nTherefore $ f(x) = x $ for all x.\\n\\nSo the only solutions are $ f \\\\equiv 0 $ and $ f(x) = x $.\\n\\nBut check $ f \\\\equiv 0 $: we did, works.\\n\\n$ f(x) = x $: works.\\n\\nAre there any others? From above, when $ f(1) = a $, only possibilities $ a=0 $ or $ a=1 $, leading to these two.\\n\\nBut is $ f \\\\equiv 0 $ covered? When $ a=0 $, we got $ f \\\\equiv 0 $.\\n\\nSo both solutions.\\n\\nBut let me confirm $ f \\\\equiv 0 $: \\nLHS: $ f(x*0 + y^3) = f(y^3) = 0 $\\nRHS: $ y*0 + 0^3 = 0 $. Yes.\\n\\nSo all solutions: $ f(x) = 0 $ for all x, and $ f(x) = x $ for all x.\\n\\nProblem 2: Does there exist a finite set A of positive integers with at least two elements, and an infinite set B of positive integers, such that:\\n\\n1. Any two distinct elements in A+B are coprime.\\n2. For any coprime positive integers m,n, there exists x in A+B such that $ x \\\\equiv n \\\\pmod{m} $.\\n\\nA+B = {a+b | a∈A, b∈B}\\n\\nFirst, condition 2 says that A+B is dense in the integers in the sense of covering all residue classes coprime to the modulus. Specifically, for any m,n coprime, there is x≡n mod m in A+B. This means that A+B intersects every residue class that is coprime to m, for every m. In fact, since m and n coprime, n is invertible mod m, so this is saying that A+B contains elements congruent to every reduced residue class modulo every m. That is, A+B is dense in the profinite topology or something, but more precisely, the set A+B must be such that its reduction modulo m contains all units modulo m, for every m.\\n\\nBut actually, stronger: for each pair (m,n) with gcd(m,n)=1, there is x in A+B with x≡n mod m. Since n runs over all residues coprime to m, this means that for each m, the set A+B modulo m contains all residue classes coprime to m. That is, (A+B) ∩ (Z/mZ)^× is non-empty for each m, but actually it contains all of (Z/mZ)^×? No: for each n coprime to m, there is some x in A+B with x≡n mod m, so yes, the image of A+B modulo m contains all residue classes that are coprime to m. In other words, A+B is dense in the units of Z-hat, but more simply, A+B hits every coprime residue class modulo every integer.\\n\\nNow, condition 1: any two distinct elements in A+B are coprime. That is, for any two different elements s,t in A+B, gcd(s,t)=1.\\n\\nBut A+B is infinite since B is infinite and A finite, so A+B has infinitely many elements.\\n\\nBut if I take three elements, say x,y,z in A+B, all pairwise coprime. But that's possible, like 2,3,5. But here it's infinite set, and every pair must be coprime.\\n\\nBut consider that if I have infinitely many elements, all pairwise coprime, is that possible? For example, take the primes, but primes are not closed under addition, and here A+B is sumset.\\n\\nBut pairwise coprime infinite set: yes, e.g., all prime numbers. But can such a set be of the form A+B with A finite, |A|≥2, B infinite?\\n\\nMoreover, it must satisfy the density condition.\\n\\nBut here's a problem: suppose A has at least two elements, say a1, a2 in A, a1 < a2.\\n\\nThen for each b in B, we have elements a1+b and a2+b in A+B.\\n\\nNow, gcd(a1+b, a2+b) must be 1, since they are distinct (as a1 ≠ a2).\\n\\nBut gcd(a1+b, a2+b) = gcd(a1+b, (a2+b) - (a1+b)) = gcd(a1+b, a2 - a1)\\n\\nLet d = a2 - a1 > 0, fixed since A finite.\\n\\nThen gcd(a1+b, d) must be 1 for all b in B.\\n\\nBecause gcd(a1+b, a2+b) = gcd(a1+b, d), and this must be 1.\\n\\nSo for every b in B, gcd(a1 + b, d) = 1.\\n\\nThat is, a1 + b is coprime to d for all b in B.\\n\\nSince d is fixed, the set {a1 + b | b ∈ B} must consist of numbers coprime to d.\\n\\nBut B is infinite, so this is an infinite set contained in the arithmetic progression a1 + b mod d, but specifically, all congruent to a1 + b mod d, but b varies.\\n\\nActually, as b runs through B, a1 + b runs through a1 + B.\\n\\nThe condition is that for each b, gcd(a1 + b, d) = 1, meaning that a1 + b is coprime to d.\\n\\nSo the entire set a1 + B consists of integers coprime to d.\\n\\nSimilarly, for any other pair in A, same thing.\\n\\nBut now, the density condition: for any coprime m,n, there is x in A+B with x ≡ n mod m.\\n\\nIn particular, fix m = d, and n such that gcd(d,n)=1.\\n\\nThen there should be x in A+B with x ≡ n mod d.\\n\\nBut x = a + b for some a in A, b in B.\\n\\nNow, for each fixed a, as b varies, a + b runs through a + B.\\n\\nBut earlier, for a = a1, a1 + B consists of numbers coprime to d, so a1 + b ≡ k mod d for some k coprime to d, but actually, it could hit multiple residues, but the point is that a1 + b is always coprime to d, so a1 + b ≡ r mod d with gcd(r,d)=1.\\n\\nSimilarly for other a in A.\\n\\nBut since A is finite, the set A+B modulo d is contained in the union over a in A of (a + B) mod d.\\n\\nEach a + B is contained in the set of residues coprime to d, because for each a, and for each b, gcd(a + b, d) must be considered.\\n\\nEarlier we only have that for pairs involving a1 and a2, but actually, for any two distinct elements in A+B to be coprime, in particular, for fixed a, and two different b1,b2, then a+b1 and a+b2 are both in A+B, and if b1 ≠ b2, they are distinct, so gcd(a+b1, a+b2) must be 1.\\n\\nBut gcd(a+b1, a+b2) = gcd(a+b1, (a+b2)-(a+b1)) = gcd(a+b1, b2 - b1)\\n\\nThis must be 1 for all b1 ≠ b2 in B.\\n\\nBut b2 - b1 can be arbitrary differences, and since B is infinite, the set of differences can be large.\\n\\nIn particular, for fixed b1, as b2 varies, gcd(a+b1, b2 - b1) = 1 for all b2 ≠ b1.\\n\\nBut b2 - b1 can be any integer except 0, but B may not contain all integers.\\n\\nStill, for gcd(a+b1, k) = 1 for all k = b2 - b1 ≠ 0.\\n\\nBut if B has two elements differing by k, then gcd(a+b1, k) = 1.\\n\\nSince B is infinite, it must have arbitrarily large differences, but more importantly, if B contains two elements differing by a prime p, then gcd(a+b1, p) = 1, so p does not divide a+b1.\\n\\nBut if B is infinite, the set of differences generates a subgroup, but minimally, if B has at least two elements, say b and b' , then |b - b'| = d_{bb'} >0, and for each a, gcd(a+b, a+b') = gcd(a+b, d_{bb'}) =1, so a+b coprime to d_{bb'}.\\n\\nBut this must hold for all such pairs.\\n\\nTo satisfy the density condition, A+B must hit every residue class coprime to m for every m.\\n\\nIn particular, for m large, say m prime larger than all elements in A and larger than differences, but let's think.\\n\\nSuppose we want x ≡ n mod m for gcd(m,n)=1.\\n\\nBut if m is very large, and A is fixed, then for x = a + b ≡ n mod m, so b ≡ n - a mod m.\\n\\nSince B is infinite, it might hit the required residue, but the issue is the coprimality condition.\\n\\nBut earlier, we have that for any two distinct elements in A+B, they are coprime.\\n\\nNow, since A+B is infinite, and all pairwise coprime, that means that no prime divides more than one element of A+B.\\n\\nBecause if a prime p divides two different elements s and t in A+B, then gcd(s,t) ≥ p >1, contradiction.\\n\\nTherefore, each prime divides at most one element of A+B.\\n\\nBut A+B is infinite, so it has infinitely many elements, each must be divisible by some prime, but since each prime is used at most once, the elements of A+B must all be composed of distinct prime factors; in fact, since they are pairwise coprime, the entire set has the property that their prime factors are all distinct across the set.\\n\\nMore precisely, the set A+B has the property that no prime divides more than one element in the set.\\n\\nTherefore, each element in A+B must be ±1 or prime powers or products, but crucially, the prime factors are unique to each element.\\n\\nIn particular, since there are infinitely many elements, and each requires at least one prime factor (except possibly 1, but 1 is not positive integer? Positive integers, so minimum 1, but gcd with others: if 1 is in A+B, gcd(1,k)=1 always, so ok, but 1 is coprime to all.\\n\\nBut can 1 be in A+B? A and B positive integers, so a≥1, b≥1, so a+b ≥2, so all elements ≥2, so no 1. So each element ≥2, so has a prime factor.\\n\\nAnd each prime factor is used by at most one element in A+B.\\n\\nTherefore, the number of elements in A+B up to X is at most the number of primes up to X, since each element needs a distinct prime, but actually, an element could be a prime power, like p^k, which still uses only one prime, but takes one slot.\\n\\nSince each element requires at least one prime, and primes are distinct across elements, the size of A+B up to X is at most π(X), the prime counting function.\\n\\nBut A+B is the sumset of finite A and infinite B.\\n\\nLet A have k elements, k≥2.\\n\\nThen |A+B| ∩ [1,X] ≤ k |B ∩ [1,X]|, but more relevantly, the growth rate.\\n\\nThe number of elements in A+B up to X is roughly proportional to the number of b such that min A + b ≤ X, so b ≤ X - min A, so |B ∩ [1, X - min A]| times something, but since A finite, | (A+B) ∩ [1,X] | is asymptotic to |A| |B ∩ [1,X]| as X→∞, if B has positive density, but B could be sparse.\\n\\nBut in any case, | (A+B) ∩ [1,X] | → ∞ as X→∞, and it grows at least linearly if B has positive lower density, but even if not, since B infinite, |B ∩ [1,X]| → ∞.\\n\\nBut | (A+B) ∩ [1,X] | ≤ |A| \\\\cdot |B ∩ [1,X]|, but more importantly, since each element in A+B requires a distinct prime factor, and there are only π(X) primes ≤ X, and each element in (A+B) ∩ [1,X] must have all its prime factors ≤ X, and since it has a prime factor, and that prime factor is unique to it, so the number of such elements is at most π(X) ∼ X / \\\\log X.\\n\\nOn the other hand, | (A+B) ∩ [1,X] | must be at least the number when B is dense.\\n\\nBut for the density condition: for any m,n coprime, there is x in A+B with x≡n mod m.\\n\\nIn particular, fix m, then for each n coprime to m, there is at least one x_n ≡ n mod m in A+B.\\n\\nSince there are φ(m) such n, and they are distinct modulo m, so A+B must contain at least φ(m) distinct residue classes modulo m, but actually, since each x_n is distinct if m large, but not necessarily, but at least φ(m) elements in A+B that are distinct modulo m, hence distinct elements.\\n\\nBut more strongly, for large m, φ(m) can be large.\\n\\nFor example, take m to be the product of first k primes, then φ(m)/m = ∏ (1-1/p) over first k primes, which goes to 0, but φ(m) itself goes to infinity as k→∞.\\n\\nSpecifically, φ(m) → ∞ as m→∞.\\n\\nNow, for each such m, there are φ(m) residue classes coprime to m, and for each, there is an element in A+B congruent to it mod m.\\n\\nThese elements are all distinct because they are in different residue classes mod m, so at least φ(m) distinct elements in A+B.\\n\\nMoreover, since they are all ≤ some bound? Not necessarily, they could be large.\\n\\nBut for a fixed m, the elements x satisfying x≡n mod m for some n coprime to m could be large, but we can consider how many such elements are needed.\\n\\nTo satisfy the condition for modulus m, we need at least φ(m) elements in A+B, one for each coprime residue class.\\n\\nBut since the set A+B is fixed, and must satisfy this for all m, but for each m, we just need existence, not that they are small.\\n\\nHowever, the elements for different m might be the same, but likely not.\\n\\nThe key point is that the total number of elements in A+B must be infinite, but we have a lower bound on its size.\\n\\nSpecifically, for each m, there is at least one element in A+B for each coprime residue class mod m, but since the same element can serve for multiple m, it's tricky.\\n\\nBut note that if an element x is in A+B, it satisfies x≡n mod m only for specific m and n.\\n\\nTo get a lower bound, consider that for large m, the minimal such x for a given residue class might be large, but we can consider the number of elements in A+B up to X.\\n\\nSuppose that | (A+B) ∩ [1,X] | ≤ C X / \\\\log X for some C, since at most π(X) ∼ X / \\\\log X elements, each requiring a distinct prime.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the density condition implies that A+B must be dense modulo every m.\\n\\nIn particular, for a fixed m, the set A+B must intersect every residue class coprime to m.\\n\\nThe proportion of integers coprime to m is φ(m)/m.\\n\\nIf A+B were random, we might expect density φ(m)/m, but here it's not about density, but about hitting every such class.\\n\\nBut for the size, consider that for A+B to hit all φ(m) residue classes coprime to m, and since the classes are modulo m, the elements that hit them must be at least m apart in some sense, but not really.\\n\\nThe minimal element in A+B that is ≡ n mod m could be as small as n, but could be large.\\n\\nHowever, to have such an element for each n coprime to m, and since there are φ(m) such n, and they are distinct mod m, the smallest such elements are at least 1,2,...,m, but could be larger.\\n\\nBut the maximal minimal representative is at most m, since for each residue class, there is a representative between 1 and m.\\n\\nBut that representative may not be in A+B; we need some multiple, but the smallest x≡n mod m is n if n≤m, but x could be n, or n+m, n+2m, etc.\\n\\nThe smallest possible x in the residue class is min over k≥0 of n + k m, which is n if n≥1, so between 1 and m.\\n\\nBut this smallest representative may not be in A+B; we need that for each such class, there is some x in A+B in that class, but x could be large.\\n\\nSo for a given m, the elements in A+B that are used to satisfy the condition for modulus m could be very large.\\n\\nHowever, since A+B is fixed, and must satisfy this for all m simultaneously, we need that for every m, and every n coprime to m, there is some x in A+B with x≡n mod m.\\n\\nThis means that the set A+B is dense in the profinite completion, or that it meets every open set in the adeles, but more simply, the closure of A+B in the profinite topology is the whole space, but actually, since it hits all coprime residues, it is dense in the units.\\n\\nBut crucially, for the size, we can consider that the number of elements in A+B up to X must be large enough to cover the requirements for small m.\\n\\nBut perhaps a better way: suppose that A+B has only finitely many elements, but it can't, since B infinite, A finite nonempty, so A+B infinite.\\n\\nBut the constraint is that | (A+B) ∩ [1,X] | ≤ π(X) + c for some c, but actually, since each element ≥2 has a prime factor, and prime factors are distinct, so the map from A+B to primes, sending each element to one of its prime factors, is injective, so |A+B| ≤ number of primes, but A+B is infinite, and there are infinitely many primes, so cardinality is not an issue.\\n\\nThe issue is the growth rate.\\n\\n| (A+B) ∩ [1,X] | ≤ π(X) ∼ X / \\\\log X\\n\\nOn the other hand, what is the minimal possible size of A+B ∩ [1,X] for such a sumset.\\n\\nSince A is finite, say A = {a1,a2,...,ak}, k≥2.\\n\\nThen A+B = ∪_{i=1}^k (ai + B)\\n\\nSo | (A+B) ∩ [1,X] | ≤ k |B ∩ [1,X]|\\n\\nBut also, since it's a union, it could be less.\\n\\nBut | (A+B) ∩ [1,X] | ≥ max over i | (ai + B) ∩ [1,X] | = |B ∩ [1,X - ai]| for each i, so roughly |B ∩ [1,X]|\\n\\nBut more precisely, it grows like the size of B.\\n\\nNow, for the density condition, we need that for every m, A+B hits all φ(m) residue classes coprime to m.\\n\\nThe number of such classes is φ(m), which can be as large as m / \\\\log \\\\log m or something, but for prime m, φ(m)=m-1.\\n\\nTake m prime, large.\\n\\nThen φ(m) = m-1.\\n\\nThere are m-1 residue classes coprime to m, namely 1,2,...,m-1.\\n\\nFor each such n, there must be x_n in A+B with x_n ≡ n mod m.\\n\\nSince m is prime, all n=1 to m-1 are coprime.\\n\\nThe elements x_n are all distinct because they are in different residue classes mod m, so at least m-1 distinct elements in A+B.\\n\\nMoreover, each x_n ≥ n ≥1, but could be large.\\n\\nBut since they are distinct, the largest x_n is at least m-1.\\n\\nBut more importantly, for this fixed m, we need at least m-1 elements in A+B.\\n\\nBut since m can be arbitrarily large, this is fine, as A+B is infinite.\\n\\nHowever, these elements x_n for modulus m could be greater than m, even much larger.\\n\\nTo satisfy for all m, we need infinitely many elements, but the constraining factor is the growth rate.\\n\\nSuppose that for a large prime m, the smallest x in A+B that is ≡ n mod m might be around m or larger.\\n\\nBut in the worst case, it could be large.\\n\\nHowever, for the set A+B, the number of elements up to X is O(X / \\\\log X), as established.\\n\\nOn the other hand, for a given X, consider all primes m such that m ≤ X / 2, say.\\n\\nFor each such prime m, we need at least m-1 elements in A+B that are congruent to 1,2,...,m-1 mod m respectively.\\n\\nThese elements for different m might coincide, but likely not.\\n\\nEach such element x for modulus m must satisfy x ≡ n mod m for some n=1 to m-1, so in particular, x ≥1, and if x ≤ X, then it can serve for m only if m ≤ x, but not necessarily.\\n\\nThe key point is that each element x in A+B can satisfy the condition for modulus m only if m does not divide x, and x ≡ n mod m for the required n, but for a fixed x, it fixes x mod m for all m, so it can be used for the requirement for modulus m only if x ≡ n mod m for the specific n that we need, but since for each m, we need to cover all n, a single x covers only one residue class per m.\\n\\nTo cover all φ(m) classes for a given m, we need at least φ(m) different elements in A+B, each covering one class.\\n\\nMoreover, these elements must be distinct for a fixed m, as they are in different classes.\\n\\nNow, for different m, the same element can be reused.\\n\\nThe total number of \"requirements\" is sum over m of φ(m), but this diverges, so not helpful.\\n\\nNote that for a fixed element x in A+B, it can be used to satisfy the condition for modulus m only if gcd(m, x) =1? Not necessarily, because we need x ≡ n mod m with gcd(m,n)=1, but if gcd(m,x)=d>1, then x ≡ n mod m implies d divides n, so gcd(m,n)≥d>1, so cannot be coprime. Therefore, for x to be usable for modulus m, we must have gcd(m,x)=1.\\n\\nMoreover, x must be congruent to the required n mod m.\\n\\nBut for a fixed x, and for modulus m, if gcd(m,x)=1, then x mod m is some residue coprime to m, so it can satisfy the requirement for that particular residue class.\\n\\nBut for other residue classes mod m, it doesn't help.\\n\\nSo for each modulus m, we need φ(m) different elements, each providing a different coprime residue class mod m.\\n\\nNow, each element x in A+B can provide, for each m with gcd(m,x)=1, the residue class x mod m.\\n\\nBut to cover all φ(m) classes for a given m, we need φ(m) elements whose residues mod m cover all coprime classes.\\n\\nThe minimal number of elements needed to cover all coprime residues mod m is at least φ(m), obviously, and since they must be distinct mod m, we need at least φ(m) elements that are distinct mod m.\\n\\nFor large m, φ(m) is large.\\n\\nNow, the elements in A+B up to X are at most C X / \\\\log X for some C.\\n\\nConsider a large X, and look at all m such that m ≤ Y for some Y.\\n\\nFor each such m, we need at least φ(m) elements in A+B that are distinct mod m.\\n\\nBut these elements could be larger than m.\\n\\nTo minimize the number, suppose that for each m, the elements used are as small as possible.\\n\\nBut in our case, the set is fixed.\\n\\nSuppose that the largest element in A+B up to X is X, and there are N(X) = | (A+B) ∩ [1,X] | ≤ C X / \\\\log X\\n\\nFor a modulus m, the number of elements in A+B ∩ [1,X] that are distinct mod m is at most min(N(X), m)\\n\\nTo cover all φ(m) coprime residue classes, we need at least φ(m) elements that are distinct mod m, so in particular, we need at least φ(m) elements in A+B, but they could be larger than X.\\n\\nFor the condition to be satisfied, for each m, there must be some elements in A+B (possibly large) that cover the classes.\\n\\nHowever, if for some m, all elements in A+B are divisible by some prime dividing m, then gcd(m,x) may not be 1.\\n\\nBut earlier, we have that for the pairwise coprimality, each prime divides at most one element of A+B.\\n\\nNow, for a large prime m, if m is larger than all elements in A+B, but A+B is infinite, so for any M, there are elements larger than M, so for a given m, there are elements larger than m.\\n\\nBut for a large prime m, φ(m) = m-1.\\n\\nWe need m-1 distinct elements in A+B, each giving a different residue mod m.\\n\\nSince there are m residue classes, and we need m-1 of them (all except 0), and since the elements are distinct, as long as we have at least m-1 elements, they could cover, but they might not cover all nonzero classes if they are not spread out.\\n\\nBut in the worst case, if all elements are congruent mod m, they cover only one class.\\n\\nBut we need them to cover all m-1 nonzero classes.\\n\\nSo we need that the set A+B, when reduced mod m, includes all nonzero residues.\\n\\nThat is, A+B is dense modulo m for every m, in the sense that it hits all nonzero residues if m prime, but for composite m, only the coprime ones.\\n\\nFor m prime, we need A+B to intersect every nonzero residue class mod m.\\n\\nNow, since A+B is a union of k arithmetic progressions: ai + B for i=1..k.\\n\\nEach ai + B is a shift of B.\\n\\nFor A+B to hit all nonzero residues mod m, for every prime m.\\n\\nBut if B is contained in a proper subgroup, it might not.\\n\\nBut more critically, the size constraint.\\n\\nSuppose that for a large prime m, the number of elements in A+B up to m is at most C m / \\\\log m\\n\\nBut we need at least m-1 elements in A+B to cover the m-1 residue classes, but these elements could be larger than m.\\n\\nIn fact, the smallest possible elements in each residue class are between 1 and m, but if none of them are in A+B, we need larger ones, like n + m, n+2m, etc.\\n\\nThe smallest available might be large.\\n\\nHowever, since A+B must contain some element in each class, the largest minimal representative over all classes for modulus m is at most m, but again, may not be in A+B.\\n\\nTo ensure that there is an element in A+B in each nonzero class mod m, and since A+B is fixed, for large m, if A+B has slow growth, it might miss some classes.\\n\\nBut specifically, the number of elements in A+B that are ≤ K is at most C K / \\\\log K\\n\\nFor a given m, the number of elements in A+B that are ≤ 2m, say, is at most C (2m) / \\\\log(2m) ∼ 2C m / \\\\log m\\n\\nThe number of residue classes mod m is m.\\n\\nIf 2C m / \\\\log m < m, which is true for large m, since log m → ∞, then the number of elements ≤ 2m is less than m, so by pigeonhole, some residue class mod m has no element of A+B in [1,2m].\\n\\nBut we need an element in each nonzero class, so if a nonzero class has no element ≤ 2m, then the smallest element in that class in A+B is at least 2m+1.\\n\\nBut that's ok, as long as there is some element.\\n\\nFor example, it could be 2m+1, or larger.\\n\\nBut for that class, there might be an element at 3m+1, etc.\\n\\nAs long as for each class, there is some multiple, it could be fine.\\n\\nBut the issue is that for the pairwise coprimality, we have a conflict.\\n\\nRecall that for any two distinct a1,a2 in A, and for any b in B, gcd(a1+b, a2+b) = gcd(a1+b, a2-a1) =1, as before.\\n\\nLet d = |a2 - a1| >0.\\n\\nThen for every b in B, gcd(a1 + b, d) =1.\\n\\nSo a1 + b is coprime to d for all b in B.\\n\\nSimilarly for other pairs.\\n\\nNow, d is fixed, so this means that B is contained in the set of b such that a1 + b coprime to d, i.e., b ≡ -a1 + r mod d for r coprime to d.\\n\\nSo B is contained in a union of φ(d) arithmetic progressions modulo d.\\n\\nSimilarly for other pairs, but since A finite, overall B is contained in a finite union of arithmetic progressions.\\n\\nNow, the density condition requires that A+B hits every coprime residue class modulo every m.\\n\\nBut A+B = ∪_{a in A} (a + B)\\n\\nEach a + B is contained in a + (union of APs mod d), so modulo d, it's contained in certain residue classes.\\n\\nBut for large m, we need modulo m.\\n\\nSuppose that d is fixed, and B is contained in certain residue classes mod d.\\n\\nThen a + B is contained in a + those classes mod d.\\n\\nSo A+B is contained in a finite union of residue classes mod d.\\n\\nLet S be the set of residue classes mod d that intersect A+B.\\n\\nSince A+B ⊆ ∪_{c in S} (c + d\\\\mathbb{Z})\\n\\nNow, for a modulus m that is a multiple of d, say m = d k, then modulo m, the set A+B is contained in the lift of S to mod m, which has size |S| * k, but there are m = d k residue classes, and φ(m) could be large.\\n\\nBut more importantly, for the coprime condition, we need that A+B hits residue classes coprime to m.\\n\\nBut if m is divisible by a prime p that divides d, and if all elements in A+B are divisible by p, then they are not coprime to m if p|m.\\n\\nBut from earlier, for each b, a1 + b coprime to d, so in particular, if p|d, then a1 + b not divisible by p, so gcd(a1+b, p)=1.\\n\\nSimilarly for other a, but for a given a, a + b may or may not be divisible by p.\\n\\nBut since gcd(a + b, d) may not be 1 for all a, only for the differences.\\n\\nFor example, take a in A, b in B, a + b could be divisible by a prime dividing d, as long as it doesn't cause gcd issues.\\n\\nBut from the pairwise gcd condition, for two elements in the same a, say a+b1 and a+b2, gcd(a+b1, a+b2) = gcd(a+b1, b1-b2), and this must be 1.\\n\\nSo if b1-b2 is divisible by a prime p, then gcd(a+b1, p) =1, so p does not divide a+b1.\\n\\nSince B is infinite, it has arbitrarily large differences, so for any prime p, if B has two elements differing by a multiple of p, then for each a, a+b1 not divisible by p.\\n\\nBut B may avoid certain differences.\\n\\nTo ensure the density, perhaps B must be dense.\\n\\nBut let's try to see if such sets exist.\\n\\nSuppose A = {1,2}, for example.\\n\\nThen d = |2-1| =1.\\n\\ngcd(a1+b, d) = gcd(1+b, 1) =1, always true.\\n\\nSimilarly for any difference, if d=1, gcd with 1 is 1, always.\\n\\nSo no restriction from that.\\n\\nBut for any two distinct elements in A+B, they must be coprime.\\n\\nA+B = {1+b, 2+b for b in B}\\n\\nNow, gcd(1+b, 2+b) = gcd(1+b, (2+b)-(1+b)) = gcd(1+b,1) =1, always.\\n\\nAlso, gcd(1+b1, 1+b2) for b1≠b2 must be 1.\\n\\ngcd(1+b1, 1+b2) = gcd(1+b1, b1-b2)\\n\\nSimilarly, gcd(2+b1, 2+b2) = gcd(2+b1, b1-b2)\\n\\nAnd gcd(1+b1, 2+b2) = gcd(1+b1, (2+b2)-(1+b1)) = gcd(1+b1, 1 + b2 - b1)\\n\\nThis must be 1 for all b1≠b2, and for all b1,b2.\\n\\nIn particular, for fixed b1, as b2 varies, gcd(1+b1, b1-b2) =1 for all b2 ≠ b1.\\n\\nThis means that 1+b1 is coprime to all integers of the form b1 - b2 for b2 in B \\\\ {b1}.\\n\\nSince B is infinite, the set {b1 - b2 | b2 in B, b2 ≠ b1} is infinite, and if it contains a multiple of a prime p, then p does not divide 1+b1.\\n\\nIn particular, if B contains two elements differing by p, then for each b1, gcd(1+b1, p) =1, so p does not divide 1+b1.\\n\\nSimilarly for 2+b1.\\n\\nTo make B such that A+B has slow growth, but also satisfies the density.\\n\\nSuppose that B is the set of factorials, or something sparse.\\n\\nBut then A+B grows fast, and may not hit small residue classes.\\n\\nFor example, if B = {k! for k=1,2,3,...}, then for large m, to have x≡n mod m, with x=a+b, b=k!, for k≥m, b≡0 mod m, so a+b ≡ a mod m.\\n\\nSo for large b, a+b ≡ a mod m.\\n\\nSo the values are approximately a1 or a2 mod m for large b.\\n\\nSo only two residue classes are hit for large m, but we need φ(m) classes, which is large, so for large m, only two classes are represented in A+B for large elements, but for small elements, there might be more.\\n\\nFor example, with b=1,2,6,24, etc., so a+b for a=1,2: 2,3,7,8,25,26, etc.\\n\\nMod m for large m, the small elements are few, so for m large, the only elements in A+B are large, and they are ≡1 or 2 mod m if m > max of small elements, but since b=k! for k≥m, b≡0 mod m, so a+b≡a mod m, so only residues 1 and 2 mod m.\\n\\nBut if m>2, and m prime, we need all 1,2,3,...,m-1 mod m, but only 1 and 2 are hit, so for n=3, no x≡3 mod m, unless there is a small x, but for m large, the small x are fixed, so for m > max A+B small, only large elements, which are only in classes 1 and 2, so if m>3, 3 is not hit, so no x≡3 mod m, but gcd(m,3)=1 if m not 3, so for m>3 prime, we need x≡3 mod m, but not available.\\n\\nSo fails.\\n\\nTo hit all residue classes, B must be such that a+B is dense modulo every m, which requires that B is dense modulo every m, i.e., B intersects every residue class modulo every m.\\n\\nBut if B is contained in a proper arithmetic progression, it may not.\\n\\nFor example, if B is all even, then a+B may be all odd or all even, not dense.\\n\\nBut in our case, from the pairwise gcd, we have constraints.\\n\\nBack to the growth rate.\\n\\nWe have that | (A+B) ∩ [1,X] | ≤ C X / \\\\log X\\n\\nOn the other hand, for the set to be dense modulo every m, in particular, for each m, the number of elements in A+B up to m must be at least the number to cover the classes, but as seen, it can be done with elements larger than m.\\n\\nHowever, a theorem in number theory says that if a set S has upper density 0, then it cannot be that for every m, S is dense modulo m in the sense of hitting all coprime classes.\\n\\nIn particular, if the counting function is o(X), it might be possible, but here it's O(X / \\\\log X), which is o(X), but still.\\n\\nI recall that the set of primes has counting function ~ X / \\\\log X, and the primes are not dense modulo m; for example, modulo 4, primes are 1 or 3 mod 4, never 0 or 2, so misses even residues, but for coprime classes, modulo 4, coprime are 1 and 3, which are hit, so for m=4, it hits both coprime classes.\\n\\nIn general, the primes hit all coprime residue classes modulo every m, by Dirichlet's theorem, since for gcd(a,m)=1, there are infinitely many primes ≡ a mod m.\\n\\nSo the set of primes satisfies the density condition: for any coprime m,n, there is a prime p≡n mod m.\\n\\nMoreover, any two distinct primes are coprime, so pairwise coprime.\\n\\nBut is the set of primes of the form A+B for finite A with |A|≥2 and infinite B?\\n\\nA+B is a sumset.\\n\\nCan the set of primes be written as A+B with |A|≥2 finite, B infinite?\\n\\nSuppose A = {a1,a2}, then A+B = {a1+b, a2+b for b in B}\\n\\nThis is a union of two arithmetic progressions with the same difference set B.\\n\\nThe set of primes has asymptotic density 0, and this set would have at least the size of B, but more importantly, by the Green-Tao theorem, primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, but here A+B is a union of two shifts of B.\\n\\nIf B has positive density, then A+B has positive density, but primes have density 0, so B must have density 0.\\n\\nBut more critically, the sumset A+B with |A|=k has the property that its doubling constant is bounded, but for primes, the sumset of primes with itself has many elements.\\n\\nSuppose that the set of primes is P = A+B.\\n\\nThen for large x, the number of ways to write x as a+b with a in A, b in B is at most |A|, but for primes, most numbers are not sum of two primes, but here it's not that.\\n\\nP = {a+b | a in A, b in B}, so every prime is of the form a+b for some a in A, b in B.\\n\\nSince A is finite, for each a, the set a+B contains infinitely many primes, so B must be such that a+B contains infinitely many primes for each a.\\n\\nBut moreover, the entire set is exactly the primes.\\n\\nBut the set A+B has the property that it is periodic modulo any number in some sense, but not.\\n\\nSuppose |A|=2, A={0,2}, but A must be positive integers, so say A={2,4}.\\n\\nThen A+B = {2+b, 4+b for b in B}\\n\\nThis is all even if B even, or mixed.\\n\\nBut primes include 2,3,5,7, etc., odd and even.\\n\\n2 is even, others odd.\\n\\nSuppose 2 is in A+B, say 2= a+b, a≥2, b≥1, so a+b≥3>2, impossible. a and b positive integers, so a≥1, b≥1, a+b≥2, so 2 can be in A+B only if a=1,b=1 or a=2,b=0 not allowed, so only if 1 in A and 1 in B.\\n\\nSuppose 1 in A, say A={1,3}, B contains 1, then 1+1=2, 3+1=4 not prime, etc.\\n\\nBut A+B must contain only primes, but also, for example, if b=2, 1+2=3, 3+2=5, both prime, good, but if b=4, 1+4=5, 3+4=7, good, b=6, 1+6=7, 3+6=9 not prime, so 9 in A+B, but 9 is not prime, contradiction.\\n\\nSo to avoid composites, B must be chosen so that for all b in B, a+b is prime for all a in A.\\n\\nBut A has at least two elements, say a1,a2.\\n\\nThen for each b in B, a1+b and a2+b are both prime.\\n\\nMoreover, since B infinite, there are infinitely many b such that a1+b and a2+b are both prime.\\n\\nThis is like twin primes if a2-a1=2, but for general difference.\\n\\nBut also, A+B must contain all primes, or at least, in this case for the density, but in our case for problem 2, A+B doesn't have to be the primes; it can be a superset, but in this case for the pairwise coprime, if A+B contains composites, but as long as any two distinct elements are coprime, it might be ok, but if it contains a composite, say 9, and another number, but gcd(9,3)=3>1, but 3 may not be in A+B, but if 3 is in A+B, then gcd(9,3)=3>1, not allowed.\\n\\nIn fact, since the elements are pairwise coprime, and if a composite number c is in A+B, and c has a prime factor p, then p must not divide any other element in A+B, but p itself may not be in A+B, but if p is in A+B, then gcd(c,p)≥p>1, not allowed, so p not in A+B.\\n\\nBut also, no multiple of p can be in A+B except c, but c may have other factors.\\n\\nBut the main point is that A+B can contain composite numbers, as long as their prime factors are not shared with any other element.\\n\\nFor example, A+B could contain 4,9,25, etc., prime squares, as long as no two share a common factor.\\n\\nBut for the density condition, it needs to hit all coprime residue classes.\\n\\nBut back to the growth rate.\\n\\nPerhaps it is impossible because of the growth rate.\\n\\nSuppose that for large X, | (A+B) ∩ [1,X] | ≤ C X / \\\\log X\\n\\nNow, the number of integers up to X that are coprime to all m up to Y is related to the inclusion, but for the density condition, consider that the probability that a random number is in a coprime residue class mod m is φ(m)/m.\\n\\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, for m square-free, the density is prod_{p|m} (1-1/p)\\n\\nBut for our purpose, the minimal order.\\n\\nI recall that the set of integers that are coprime to all m is only ±1, but here it's not that.\\n\\nPerhaps use that the sum over m of 1/φ(m) diverges, but not helpful.\\n\\nAnother idea: the condition that A+B hits every coprime residue class mod m for every m implies that A+B is not contained in any arithmetic progression with difference >1, but more than that.\\n\\nIn particular, for any prime p, A+B must contain an element not divisible by p, in fact, elements in all nonzero classes if p prime.\\n\\nBut from the pairwise coprime, for a fixed p, p can divide at most one element of A+B.\\n\\nSo for each prime p, there is at most one element in A+B that is divisible by p.\\n\\nTherefore, the number of elements in A+B that are divisible by some prime ≤ Y is at most π(Y) ~ Y / \\\\log Y\\n\\nThe number of elements in A+B up to X is at most C X / \\\\log X\\n\\nFor large X, choose Y = X.\\n\\nThen the number of elements in A+B ∩ [1,X] that are divisible by some prime ≤ X is at most π(X) ~ X / \\\\log X\\n\\nBut every integer >1 is divisible by some prime ≤ itself, so for elements in [2,X], they are all divisible by some prime ≤ X.\\n\\nSo | (A+B) ∩ [2,X] | ≤ π(X) ~ X / \\\\log X\\n\\nWhich is consistent with our earlier bound.\\n\\nBut this is equality in some sense, so perhaps achievable.\\n\\nFor example, if A+B is the set of primes, then |P ∩ [1,X]| ~ X / \\\\log X, and each prime is divisible by only one prime (itself), and pairwise coprime, and hits all coprime classes by Dirichlet.\\n\\nSo if we can write the set of primes as A+B for some finite A with |A|≥2 and infinite B, then it would work.\\n\\nBut can we?\\n\\nSuppose A = {0,2}, but 0 not positive.\\nA must be positive integers.\\n\\nSuppose A = {2,4}, then A+B = {2+b, 4+b}\\n\\nSet this equal to the set of primes.\\n\\nThen for b in B, 2+b and 4+b are both prime.\\n\\nSo b+2 and b+4 are twin primes differing by 2.\\n\\nBut not all primes are of this form; for example, 3 is not 2+b or 4+b for b≥1, since 2+b≥3, 4+b≥5, so 3 is not covered.\\n\\nIf A={1,2}, then A+B = {1+b,2+b}\\n\\n1+b and 2+b differ by 1, so consecutive integers, both prime only if 2 and 3, so b=1, 1+1=2,2+1=3, but then for other b, 1+b and 2+b are consecutive, so one even >2, not prime.\\n\\nSo only one b possible.\\n\\nSuppose A={1,3}, then 1+b and 3+b differ by 2, so twin prime pair.\\n\\nThen A+B = {1+b,3+b} for b in B, with 1+b and 3+b both prime.\\n\\nSo the set is all numbers that are in a twin prime pair as the smaller or larger.\\n\\nBut not all primes are in twin prime pairs; for example, 23 is not part of a twin prime pair (21 and 25 not prime), so if 23 is not in A+B, but we need it for the density? No, for the density condition, we don't need all primes; we need that for any coprime m,n, there is x in A+B with x≡n mod m, but x doesn't have to be prime; it can be composite, as long as in A+B and pairwise coprime with others.\\n\\nIn this case, if A+B consists of numbers like 3,5,5,7,9,11, etc., but 9 is composite, and if 3 is also in A+B, gcd(9,3)=3>1, not allowed.\\n\\nIn this construction, for each b, we have 1+b and 3+b, both prime, so for b=2, 3 and 5; b=4, 5 and 7; b=6, 7 and 9 not prime; so only when both prime.\\n\\nBut 5 appears twice, but as an element, it's the same, so A+B = {3,5,7,11,13,17,19, etc.} the primes that are in twin prime pairs.\\n\\nBut 3 and 5 are both in, gcd(3,5)=1, good, but are there duplicates? 5 is in for b=2 and b=4, but it's the same number, so in the set once.\\n\\nBut is 9 in? Only if for some b, 1+b=9 or 3+b=9, so b=8 or b=6, but for b=8, 1+8=9 not prime, so not included since we only include when both are prime, but in the set A+B, it's the values, so if for b=8, 1+8=9, 3+8=11, but 9 not prime, but in the sumset, a+b is defined for all a in A, b in B, so if B contains b, then both 1+b and 3+b are in A+B, regardless of whether they are prime or not.\\n\\nOh! I forgot that.\\n\\nIn the sumset A+B, for each b in B, and each a in A, a+b is in A+B.\\n\\nSo if B contains b, then both 1+b and 3+b are in A+B.\\n\\nEven if 1+b is composite, it is still in the set.\\n\\nFor example, if B contains 8, then 1+8=9 and 3+8=11 are in A+B.\\n\\nThen 9 and 3: if 3 is in A+B, say from b=2, 1+2=3, then gcd(9,3)=3>1, not allowed.\\n\\nTo avoid this, we must ensure that no number in A+B shares a common factor with another.\\n\\nIn particular, if 3 is in A+B, then no multiple of 3 can be in A+B.\\n\\nBut if B contains a number b such that 1+b ≡ 0 mod 3, i.e., b≡2 mod 3, then 1+b divisible by 3, and if 1+b >3, it is composite or 3, but if 1+b=3, b=2, which is ok, but for b>2, 1+b≥4, so if divisible by 3, >3, so composite, and gcd with 3 is 3>1.\\n\\nSo to prevent this, B must avoid b≡2 mod 3, so that 1+b not divisible by 3.\\n\\nSimilarly, for other primes.\\n\\nBut it's complicated.\\n\\nPerhaps it is impossible.\\n\\nMaybe the answer is no.\\n\\nAfter search, I recall that for the set to be pairwise coprime and infinite, and of the form A+B with A finite, it must have positive density or something, but not.\\n\\nAnother thought: in the beginning, for A with at least two elements, say a1< a2, then for each b, gcd(a1+b, a2+b) = gcd(a1+b, d) =1, with d=a2-a1>0.\\n\\nSo a1+b coprime to d for all b in B.\\n\\nSimilarly, for any other a in A, gcd(a1+b, a- a1) =1 for all b, etc.\\n\\nBut d is fixed, so B is contained in the set where a1+b coprime to d, i.e., b not in -a1 + p\\\\mathbb{Z} for p|d.\\n\\nSo B avoids certain arithmetic progressions.\\n\\nThen a1+B is contained in the set coprime to d.\\n\\nSimilarly for other shifts.\\n\\nNow for the density condition, take m = d * k for large k.\\n\\nThen modulo m, the set A+B is contained in a union of residue classes that are coprime to d, because for each a, a+b, and a+b coprime to d for the pairs, but not necessarily.\\n\\nFor example, take a= a1, then a1+b coprime to d, so a1+b ≡ r mod d with gcd(r,d)=1.\\n\\nFor other a, say a3, gcd(a1+b, a3+b) = gcd(a1+b, a3-a1), and this must be 1, so a1+b coprime to a3-a1.\\n\\nBut a3-a1 may have different prime factors.\\n\\nSo overall, a1+b must be coprime to the gcd of all differences, but not necessarily.\\n\\nLet D be the greatest common divisor of all differences a_i - a_j for i,j in A.\\n\\nThen for any i,j, gcd(a_i + b, a_j + b) = gcd(a_i + b, a_i - a_j) =1, so a_i + b coprime to a_i - a_j.\\n\\nIn particular, for fixed i, a_i + b coprime to a_i - a_j for all j.\\n\\nSo a_i + b coprime to the gcd of {a_i - a_j | j}, which may be a divisor of D.\\n\\nBut not necessarily to D.\\n\\nHowever, a_i + b must be coprime to each a_i - a_j.\\n\\nSince there are finitely many, let M_i be the product of all |a_i - a_j| for j≠i.\\n\\nThen a_i + b coprime to M_i for all b in B.\\n\\nSo a_i + b is coprime to M_i.\\n\\nSince M_i is fixed, this means that a_i + b avoids the prime factors of M_i.\\n\\nBut for the density, when we take m large, if m is divisible by a prime p that divides M_i, then a_i + b may be divisible by p or not, but the condition is that it is never divisible by p if p|M_i, because if p| M_i, and p| a_i + b, then gcd(a_i + b, M_i) ≥ p >1, contradiction.\\n\\nSo for each i, and for each prime p dividing M_i, p does not divide a_i + b for any b in B.\\n\\nSo a_i + b not ≡ 0 mod p for all b.\\n\\nSo the residue class 0 mod p is avoided for the progression a_i + B.\\n\\nFor other residue classes, it may be hit.\\n\\nBut for the coprime condition modulo m, if m is divisible by such a p, then for the residue class n mod m with gcd(m,n)=1, we need x≡n mod m in A+B.\\n\\nBut if p| m and p| M_i for some i, then for the progression a_i + B, it never hits 0 mod p, but it may hit other classes.\\n\\nAs long as it hits n mod m, it might be ok, but the problem is that for large m, with many prime factors, the avoidance might conflict with the requirement to hit all coprime classes.\\n\\nBut perhaps not.\\n\\nGiven the time, and since for the first problem we have the answer, for the second, I think it is impossible, so no such sets exist.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 2 is no.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"f(x) = 0 for all x, and f(x) = x for all x\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"no\"\n}",
