Four of these regions each have a central angle of $x^\\\\circ$, and the remaining two regions have central angles of $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nThe total central angle in a circle is $360^\\\\circ$. So we can write:\\n\\n$$\\n4x + 20 + 140 = 360\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n4x + 160 = 360\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n4x = 200 \\\\Rightarrow x = 50\\n$$\\n\\nSo each of the four regions has a central angle of $50^\\\\circ$. Now, the problem asks for the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region. But wait — the problem does **not** specify which regions are shaded.\\n\\nRe-reading: The question says “the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region” but gives no information about which regions are shaded. This seems incomplete — unless the shading is implied.\\n\\nWait — perhaps we missed something. Let's look again: it says “four regions each have a central angle of $x^\\\\circ$”, and the other two are $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$. But still, no mention of shading.\\n\\nBut since the question is asking for a numerical answer, likely the shaded regions are either the four $x^\\\\circ$ ones or the other two. But without explicit info, this is ambiguous.\\n\\nWait — perhaps there's a typo or misinterpretation. Alternatively, maybe the shaded region refers to the non-$x$ regions? But that doesn't make sense.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intends that the **shaded regions are the two unequal ones**, or vice versa?\\n\\nBut let's reconsider: maybe the problem was copied incorrectly? Or perhaps the shading is meant to be inferred from context?\\n\\nWait — actually, upon close inspection, the problem says: \\\"a circular spinner is divided into six regions\\\" — but only six regions are mentioned: four with $x^\\\\circ$, one with $20^\\\\circ$, one with $140^\\\\circ$. That’s six total.\\n\\nBut it doesn’t say which are shaded. Unless... perhaps the original problem had a diagram where certain regions were shaded, but in the text version, that info is missing?\\n\\nBut the problem is being asked, so likely the shaded regions are the four $x^\\\\circ$ ones — or maybe the opposite.\\n\\nWait — another idea: perhaps “shaded region” is a generic term, and we’re supposed to assume that all regions except the two specified are shaded? Or perhaps the problem meant to say that the four $x^\\\\circ$ regions are shaded?\\n\\nBut without such specification, we cannot proceed — unless the term “shaded” is defined by context.\\n\\nWait — perhaps I made a mistake: the problem says “the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region” — but never defines which are shaded. That can't be.\\n\\nUnless — could it be that “shaded” refers to the regions that are not the $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$ ones? That is, the four $x^\\\\circ$ regions are shaded?\\n\\nThat would make sense — often in such problems, the “unusual” regions are unshaded. But it's an assumption.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant to say that the regions with $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$ are shaded? But then why group the other four?\\n\\nGiven that four regions are identical in angle (after solving $x=50$), it's plausible they are the shaded ones.\\n\\nBut let's suppose instead that the problem actually meant: “what is the probability that the arrow stops in one of the four equal regions?” — i.e., those with angle $x^\\\\circ$. Since the spinner is circular and fair, probability is proportional to angle.\\n\\nBut the word “shaded” must refer to some subset. Since no info is given, perhaps in the original context, the four $x^\\\\circ$ regions are shaded.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the two non-$x$ regions are shaded? But again, arbitrary.\\n\\nWait — perhaps the problem is from a source where diagrams are involved, but here it's text-only. However, since the problem is solvable numerically, likely the shaded regions are the four $x^\\\\circ$ ones — because otherwise, if only $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$ are shaded, their total is $160^\\\\circ$, and probability $160/360 = 4/9$, but that doesn't use the fact that there are four regions of $x$.\\n\\nBut we used that to find $x$.\\n\\nActually, regardless of which are shaded, we need to know which ones.\\n\\nWait — re-examining: the problem says “the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region” — singular “region”, but that doesn't help.\\n\\nPerhaps it's a translation issue. Another idea: maybe “a shaded region” just means any of the shaded ones, and we need to know total shaded area.\\n\\nBut without knowing which are shaded, we cannot compute.\\n\\nWait — unless the problem implies that the four regions of $x^\\\\circ$ are shaded? That would make sense — four identical shaded regions, and two different unshaded ones.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the $140^\\\\circ$ region is shaded, and others aren't? Unlikely.\\n\\nGiven that this is a math competition-style problem, and the answer is expected to be numerical, and we found $x=50$, let's compute total angle of the four $x^\\\\circ$ regions: $4 \\\\times 50 = 200^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nThe other two: $20 + 140 = 160^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nNow, 200 + 160 = 360, correct.\\n\\nNow, if the four $x^\\\\circ$ regions are shaded, probability is $200/360 = 5/9$.\\n\\nIf the other two are shaded, $160/360 = 4/9$.\\n\\nWhich one is it?\\n\\nWait — perhaps “shaded region” refers to the region that is not the small one? But both 20 and 140 are unusual.\\n\\nAnother thought: maybe “shaded” is not specified because it's part of the problem to realize that only the value matters, but no.\\n\\nWait — perhaps I misread: “four regions each have a central angle of $x^\\\\circ$”, and “the remaining regions have central angles of $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$” — that’s two regions, so total six.\\n\\nBut still.\\n\\nPerhaps in the original problem, the diagram shows the four small ones shaded, but here, we must assume based on common patterns.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking in general, but no.\\n\\nWait — perhaps “shaded” is a red herring, and we need to find the probability for a randomly selected region? But no, it's a spinner, so it's based on area (angle).\\n\\nI think the only logical conclusion is that the problem likely intends that the **four regions of angle $x^\\\\circ$** are the shaded ones, as they are grouped together, while the other two are specified individually, possibly indicating they are different (unshaded).\\n\\nSo total shaded angle = $4 \\\\times 50 = 200^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nTotal circle = $360^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nSo probability = $200 / 360 = 5/9$.\\n\\nThus, answer to Problem 1 is $\\\\boxed{\\\\frac{5}{9}}$.\\n\\nBut let's confirm: is there any other interpretation?\\n\\nSuppose the shaded region is only the $140^\\\\circ$ one? Then probability $140/360 = 7/18$, but that ignores the rest.\\n\\nOr both $20$ and $140$: $160/360 = 4/9$.\\n\\nBut why would four identical regions be unshaded?\\n\\nIn many problems, multiple identical regions are the shaded ones.\\n\\nMoreover, $5/9$ is a nice fraction.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps “a shaded region” means any region that is shaded, and we need more info.\\n\\nBut given the constraints, I think $5/9$ is the intended answer, assuming the four $x^\\\\circ$ regions are shaded.\\n\\nMoving to Problem 2.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nA happy pair $(m, n)$ is defined as a pair of positive integers such that $\\\\gcd(m, n)$ is a perfect square.\\n\\nWe are given that $(205800, 35k)$ is a happy pair, and we need to find the number of positive integers $k$ with $k \\\\leq 2940$ such that $\\\\gcd(205800, 35k)$ is a perfect square.\\n\\nFirst, factorize the numbers.\\n\\nStart with $205800$.\\n\\n$205800 = 2058 \\\\times 100$\\n\\n$100 = 2^2 \\\\times 5^2$\\n\\n$2058$: divide by 2: $1029$\\n\\n$1029$: divisible by 3? $1+0+2+9=12$, yes. $1029 / 3 = 343$\\n\\n$343 = 7^3$\\n\\nSo $1029 = 3 \\\\times 7^3$\\n\\nThus $2058 = 2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 7^3$\\n\\nSo $205800 = 2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 7^3 \\\\times 2^2 \\\\times 5^2 = 2^3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5^2 \\\\times 7^3$\\n\\nDouble-check:\\n\\n$2^3 = 8$\\n\\n$5^2 = 25$\\n\\n$8 \\\\times 25 = 200$\\n\\n$200 \\\\times 3 = 600$\\n\\n$600 \\\\times 343 = ?$\\n\\n$600 \\\\times 300 = 180000$\\n\\n$600 \\\\times 43 = 25800$\\n\\nTotal $180000 + 25800 = 205800$, yes.\\n\\nSo $205800 = 2^3 \\\\times 3^1 \\\\times 5^2 \\\\times 7^3$\\n\\nNow, $35k = 5 \\\\times 7 \\\\times k$\\n\\nLet $k$ be a positive integer.\\n\\nWe need $\\\\gcd(205800, 35k) = \\\\gcd(2^3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5^2 \\\\times 7^3, 5 \\\\times 7 \\\\times k)$\\n\\nSince gcd takes minimum exponents, we can write:\\n\\nLet $k$ have prime factorization. Only primes that matter are those in $205800$, i.e., 2,3,5,7, and possibly others, but others won't affect gcd.\\n\\nSo let $k = 2^{a} \\\\times 3^{b} \\\\times 5^{c} \\\\times 7^{d} \\\\times m$, where $m$ is coprime to $2,3,5,7$.\\n\\nThen $35k = 5 \\\\times 7 \\\\times 2^{a} \\\\times 3^{b} \\\\times 5^{c} \\\\times 7^{d} \\\\times m = 2^{a} \\\\times 3^{b} \\\\times 5^{c+1} \\\\times 7^{d+1} \\\\times m$\\n\\nNow, $\\\\gcd(205800, 35k) = 2^{\\\\min(3,a)} \\\\times 3^{\\\\min(1,b)} \\\\times 5^{\\\\min(2,c+1)} \\\\times 7^{\\\\min(3,d+1)} \\\\times \\\\gcd(1,m)$ but since $m$ coprime to 2,3,5,7, the gcd has no other primes.\\n\\nSo gcd = $2^{\\\\min(3,a)} \\\\times 3^{\\\\min(1,b)} \\\\times 5^{\\\\min(2,c+1)} \\\\times 7^{\\\\min(3,d+1)}$\\n\\nWe need this gcd to be a perfect square.\\n\\nA number is a perfect square iff all exponents in its prime factorization are even.\\n\\nSo we need:\\n\\n- $\\\\min(3,a)$ even\\n- $\\\\min(1,b)$ even\\n- $\\\\min(2,c+1)$ even\\n- $\\\\min(3,d+1)$ even\\n\\nNow analyze each condition.\\n\\n1. $\\\\min(3,a)$ even:\\n\\nPossible values of $\\\\min(3,a)$: if $a \\\\geq 3$, min=3, which is odd → not allowed.\\n\\nIf $a = 2$, min=2, even → ok.\\n\\nIf $a = 1$, min=1, odd → not ok.\\n\\nIf $a = 0$, min=0, even → ok.\\n\\nIf $a > 3$, min=3, odd → not ok.\\n\\nSo $a$ must be 0 or 2.\\n\\n2. $\\\\min(1,b)$ even:\\n\\n$\\\\min(1,b)$:\\n\\n- If $b \\\\geq 1$, min=1, odd → not allowed.\\n- If $b = 0$, min=0, even → allowed.\\n\\nSo only $b=0$ is allowed.\\n\\n3. $\\\\min(2,c+1)$ even:\\n\\nLet $e = c+1$, so $e \\\\geq 1$ since $c \\\\geq 0$.\\n\\n$\\\\min(2,e)$ even:\\n\\n- If $e \\\\geq 2$, min=2, even → ok.\\n- If $e = 1$, min=1, odd → not ok.\\n\\nSo $e \\\\geq 2$ ⇒ $c+1 \\\\geq 2$ ⇒ $c \\\\geq 1$\\n\\nSo $c \\\\geq 1$\\n\\n4. $\\\\min(3,d+1)$ even:\\n\\nLet $f = d+1 \\\\geq 1$\\n\\n$\\\\min(3,f)$ even:\\n\\n- If $f = 1$, min=1, odd → no\\n- If $f = 2$, min=2, even → yes\\n- If $f = 3$, min=3, odd → no\\n- If $f \\\\geq 4$, min=3, odd → no\\n\\nSo only when $f=2$, i.e., $d+1=2$ ⇒ $d=1$\\n\\nSo $d$ must be 1.\\n\\nSummary of conditions on $k = 2^a \\\\times 3^b \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7^d \\\\times m$:\\n\\n- $a = 0$ or $2$\\n- $b = 0$\\n- $c \\\\geq 1$\\n- $d = 1$\\n- $m$ coprime to $2,3,5,7$ (i.e., not divisible by these primes)\\n\\nBut $k$ must satisfy $k \\\\leq 2940$, and we need to count the number of such $k$.\\n\\nNote that $m$ can introduce other prime factors, but since $k \\\\leq 2940$, $m$ must be such that $k$ remains ≤ 2940.\\n\\nBut $m$ is part of $k$, and $k = 2^a \\\\cdot 3^0 \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7^1 \\\\cdot m = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot m$, with $a \\\\in \\\\{0,2\\\\}$, $c \\\\geq 1$, and $m$ coprime to $2,3,5,7$.\\n\\nBut $m$ could be 1 or composite with primes ≥11.\\n\\nHowever, since $k \\\\leq 2940$, and $k$ includes $7 \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 2^a \\\\cdot m$, and $c \\\\geq 1$, we need to consider possible values.\\n\\nBut note: $m$ must be coprime to $2,3,5,7$, so $m$ is composed of primes $\\\\geq 11$.\\n\\nBut if $m > 1$, then $m \\\\geq 11$, so $k \\\\geq 2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 11$\\n\\nMinimum when $a=0$, $c=1$: $k \\\\geq 1 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 11 = 385$\\n\\nBut 385 ≤ 2940, so possible.\\n\\nBut $m$ can be larger.\\n\\nTo count the number of such $k$, we need to consider all combinations of $a$, $c$, and $m$ such that $k = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 2940$, with $a \\\\in \\\\{0,2\\\\}$, $c \\\\geq 1$, $m$ coprime to $2,3,5,7$, and $m \\\\geq 1$ integer.\\n\\nBut $m$ can be any positive integer coprime to $2,3,5,7$, as long as $k \\\\leq 2940$.\\n\\nBut $k$ is determined by its prime factors, but $m$ can vary.\\n\\nHowever, $k$ must be of the form $2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot m$ with the constraints, but $m$ absorbs all other prime factors not 2,3,5,7, but since $b=0$, no factor of 3, and $a$ fixed to 0 or 2, $c \\\\geq 1$, $d=1$, so yes.\\n\\nBut $m$ must be such that it doesn't introduce factors of 2,3,5,7, so $m$ is coprime to $210 = 2\\\\cdot3\\\\cdot5\\\\cdot7$.\\n\\nSo $m$ is a positive integer with $\\\\gcd(m, 210) = 1$.\\n\\nNow, for each choice of $a \\\\in \\\\{0,2\\\\}$, $c \\\\geq 1$, and $m \\\\geq 1$ with $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$, we set $k = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot m$, and require $k \\\\leq 2940$.\\n\\nBut different choices may give same $k$? No, because the form is unique: since $a$, $c$, $d=1$, $b=0$ are fixed in the factorization, and $m$ takes the rest, so each $k$ corresponds to unique $a,c,m$.\\n\\nActually, $k$ is uniquely determined by its prime factors, so yes, each such $k$ is counted once.\\n\\nBut we need to avoid double-counting, but since the decomposition is unique, no issue.\\n\\nSo we can iterate over possible $a$, $c$, and for each, find the number of $m$ such that $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$ and $2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 2940$.\\n\\nThat is, $m \\\\leq \\\\frac{2940}{2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7}$\\n\\nAnd $m \\\\geq 1$, integer, $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$.\\n\\nSo for each $a$ and $c$, compute upper bound for $m$, then count the number of positive integers $m \\\\leq M$ with $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$, where $M = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2940}{2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7} \\\\right\\\\rfloor$\\n\\nBut since $k$ must be integer, and $m$ integer, we take floor, but actually, since denominator divides 2940? Not necessarily, so we need $m \\\\leq \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2940}{N} \\\\right\\\\rfloor$ where $N = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7$\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nNow, first, factorize 2940 to help.\\n\\n$2940 = 294 \\\\times 10 = (300-6)\\\\times10$, better:\\n\\n$2940 \\\\div 10 = 294$\\n\\n$294 \\\\div 2 = 147$\\n\\n$147 \\\\div 3 = 49$\\n\\n$49 = 7^2$\\n\\nSo $2940 = 10 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 49 = 2 \\\\times 5 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 7^2 = 2^2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5 \\\\times 7^2$\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nNow, $N = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7^1$\\n\\nWith $a=0$ or $2$, $c \\\\geq 1$\\n\\nWe need $N \\\\cdot m \\\\leq 2940$, so $m \\\\leq \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2940}{N} \\\\right\\\\rfloor$\\n\\nAnd count $\\\\phi$-like function, but not Euler's totient, but count of integers up to M coprime to 210.\\n\\n210 = 2×3×5×7\\n\\nThe number of positive integers ≤ M coprime to 210 is given by inclusion-exclusion or Möbius function.\\n\\nSpecifically, $\\\\sum_{d|210} \\\\mu(d) \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{M}{d} \\\\right\\\\rfloor$\\n\\nSince 210 is square-free, yes.\\n\\n$\\\\mu(d)$ is Möbius function.\\n\\nDivisors of 210: 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14,15,21,30,35,42,70,105,210\\n\\n$\\\\mu(d)$: for d square-free, $\\\\mu(d) = (-1)^k$ where k is number of prime factors.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n- d=1: $\\\\mu=1$\\n- d=2,3,5,7: $\\\\mu=-1$\\n- d=6=2×3,10=2×5,14=2×7,15=3×5,21=3×7,35=5×7: $\\\\mu=1$\\n- d=30=2×3×5,42=2×3×7,70=2×5×7,105=3×5×7: $\\\\mu=-1$\\n- d=210=2×3×5×7: $\\\\mu=1$\\n\\nNow, for each $a$ and $c$, compute $N = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7$, then $M = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2940}{N} \\\\right\\\\rfloor$, then compute $S(M) = \\\\sum_{d|210} \\\\mu(d) \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{M}{d} \\\\right\\\\rfloor$\\n\\nThen sum over all valid $a,c$.\\n\\nBut $c \\\\geq 1$, and $N$ increases with $c$, so $M$ decreases.\\n\\nAlso, $a$ has two choices.\\n\\nList possible $c$ starting from 1 upwards until $N > 2940$, but since $m \\\\geq 1$, we need $N \\\\leq 2940$.\\n\\nFirst, fix $a$, vary $c$.\\n\\nCase 1: $a=0$\\n\\nThen $N = 2^0 \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7 = 7 \\\\cdot 5^c$\\n\\n$c \\\\geq 1$\\n\\n$c=1$: $N = 7 \\\\times 5 = 35$\\n\\n$M = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2940}{35} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = \\\\left\\\\lfloor 84 \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 84$\\n\\nNow, count number of $m \\\\leq 84$ with $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$\\n\\nCompute $S(84) = \\\\sum_{d|210} \\\\mu(d) \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{84}{d} \\\\right\\\\rfloor$\\n\\nCompute for each d:\\n\\n- d=1: $\\\\mu=1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/1 \\\\rfloor = 84$\\n- d=2: $\\\\mu=-1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/2 \\\\rfloor = 42$\\n- d=3: $\\\\mu=-1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/3 \\\\rfloor = 28$\\n- d=5: $\\\\mu=-1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/5 \\\\rfloor = 16$\\n- d=6: $\\\\mu=1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/6 \\\\rfloor = 14$\\n- d=7: $\\\\mu=-1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/7 \\\\rfloor = 12$\\n- d=10: $\\\\mu=1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/10 \\\\rfloor = 8$\\n- d=14: $\\\\mu=1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/14 \\\\rfloor = 6$\\n- d=15: $\\\\mu=1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/15 \\\\rfloor = 5$\\n- d=21: $\\\\mu=1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/21 \\\\rfloor = 4$\\n- d=30: $\\\\mu=-1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/30 \\\\rfloor = 2$\\n- d=35: $\\\\mu=1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/35 \\\\rfloor = 2$\\n- d=42: $\\\\mu=-1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/42 \\\\rfloor = 2$\\n- d=70: $\\\\mu=-1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/70 \\\\rfloor = 1$\\n- d=105: $\\\\mu=-1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/105 \\\\rfloor = 0$\\n- d=210: $\\\\mu=1$, $\\\\lfloor 84/210 \\\\rfloor = 0$\\n\\nNow sum:\\n\\nStart: $84$\\n\\nMinus: $42 + 28 + 16 + 12 = 98$?

So 20.\\n\\nSo for $a=0$, $c=1$, number of $m$ is 20.\\n\\nNow $c=2$: $N = 7 \\\\times 25 = 175$\\n\\n$M = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2940}{175} \\\\right\\\\rfloor$\\n\\n$175 \\\\times 16 = 2800$, $2940 - 2800 = 140 < 175$, so $\\\\lfloor 2940/175 \\\\rfloor = 16$\\n\\nSo $M=16$\\n\\nNow $S(16) = \\\\sum \\\\mu(d) \\\\lfloor 16/d \\\\rfloor$\\n\\n- d=1: +16\\n- d=2: -8\\n- d=3: -5 (16/3=5.333→5)\\n- d=5: -3 (16/5=3.2→3)\\n- d=6: +2 (16/6≈2.66→2)\\n- d=7: -2 (16/7≈2.28→2)\\n- d=10: +1 (16/10=1.6→1)\\n- d=14: +1 (16/14≈1.14→1)\\n- d=15: +1 (16/15≈1.06→1)\\n- d=21: +0 (16/21<1→0)\\n- d=30: -0 →0\\n- d=35: +0 →0\\n- d=42: -0 →0\\n- d=70: -0 →0\\n- d=105: -0 →0\\n- d=210: +0 →0\\n\\nNow sum:\\n\\n+16\\n-8 →8\\n-5 →3\\n-3 →0\\n+2 →2\\n-2 →0\\n+1 →1\\n+1 →2\\n+1 →3\\nOthers 0\\n\\nSo S(16)=3\\n\\nList: numbers ≤16 coprime to 210: not div by 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nOdd, not mult of 3,5,7.\\n\\n1, but 1 is coprime.\\n\\n1: gcd(1,210)=1, yes\\n3: div by 3, no\\n5: div by 5, no\\n7: div by 7, no\\n9: div by 3, no\\n11: not div by 2,3,5,7? 11 prime >7, yes\\n13: yes\\n15: div by 3,5, no\\n\\nSo 1,11,13\\n\\nYes, three numbers.

Yes, because different $a,c,m$ give different prime factors or exponents.\\n\\nFor example, $a=0,c=1,m=1$: $k=1 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 1 = 35$\\n$a=2,c=1,m=1$: $k=4 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 1 = 140$\\nDifferent.\\n\\nAnd $m$ varies, so all good.\\n\\nSo total 24 + 6 = 30.\\n\\nBut $k \\\\leq 2940$, and we have included all.\\n\\nBut let me check if for $a=0,c=3$: $N=7\\\\times125=875$, $m=1$, $k=875 \\\\times 1 = 875 \\\\leq 2940$, yes.\\n\\n$m=2$? But $m$ must be coprime to 210, so if $m=2$, but 2 divides 210, so $\\\\gcd(m,210) \\\\neq 1$, so not allowed. In our count, for $c=3,a=0$, $M=3$, and $m=1,2,3$, but only $m=1$ satisfies $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$, since $m=2,3$ are not coprime. So we correctly have only one.\\n\\nSimilarly, for $a=0,c=1,M=84$, we have 20 such $m$.\\n\\nNow, is there any constraint that $k$ must be such that $35k$ is integer, but it is.\\n\\nAlso, $k$ positive integer, yes.\\n\\nSo total 30.\\n\\nBut let me confirm the sum: $a=0$: c=1:20, c=2:3, c=3:1 → 24\\n$a=2$: c=1:5, c=2:1 → 6\\nTotal 30.\\n\\nBut earlier for $a=0,c=1,M=84,S=20$\\n$a=0,c=2,N=175,M=16,S=3$\\n$a=0,c=3,N=875,M=3,S=1$\\n$a=2,c=1,N=140,M=21,S=5$\\n$a=2,c=2,N=700,M=4,S=1$\\nAll good.\\n\\nNow, is $k=2940$ itself possible? But $k=2940=2^2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5 \\\\times 7^2$, but in our form, $b=0$, but here exponent of 3 is 1, not 0, so $b=1 \\\\neq 0$, so not included, correctly, since $b$ must be 0.\\n\\nSimilarly, $d$ must be 1, but here $7^2$, so $d=2 \\\\neq 1$, so not satisfied.\\n\\nSo no issue.\\n\\nThus, number of possible $k$ is 30.\\n\\nBut the problem says $k \\\\leq 2940$, and we have $k = N \\\\cdot m$, with $N \\\\geq 35$, $m \\\\geq 1$, so minimum $k=35$, which is fine.\\n\\nNow, back to Problem 1: I assumed the four $x^\\\\circ$ regions are shaded. But is there a way to confirm?\\n\\nNotice that after solving, $x=50$, so four regions of 50°, one of 20°, one of 140°.\\n\\nTotal shaded: if the four are shaded, 200°, prob 200/360=5/9.\\n\\nIf only the 140° is shaded, 140/360=7/18, but unlikely.\\n\\nBut perhaps “shaded region” refers to the region with angle 140°, but it says “a shaded region”, implying possibly multiple.\\n\\nAnother thought: perhaps the two regions with 20° and 140° are shaded? Total 160°, prob 160/360=4/9.\\n\\nBut 4/9 vs 5/9.\\n\\nBut in the context, since four are identical and grouped, likely they are the shaded ones.\\n\\nMoreover, 5/9 is simpler? Not really.\\n\\nBut let's see if there's another clue.\\n\\nThe problem says “the arrow stops on a shaded region”, and if only one region is shaded, it should say “the shaded region”, but it says “a”, suggesting there might be multiple.\\n\\nThe four identical ones are more likely to be shaded.\\n\\nIn many textbook problems, the repeated regions are shaded.\\n\\nSo I think 5/9 is correct.\\n\\nPerhaps the shaded regions are the ones not specified individually, i.e., the four.\\n\\nSo I'll go with that.\\n\\nThus, answers:\\nProblem 1: 5/9\\nProblem 2: 30\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5/9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"30\"\n}",
