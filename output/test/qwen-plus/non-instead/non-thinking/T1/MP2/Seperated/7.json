Four of the regions each have a central angle of $x^\\\\circ$, and the remaining two regions have central angles of $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$. The total central angle of a circle is $360^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nSo, we can write the equation:\\n\\n$$\\n4x + 20 + 140 = 360\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n4x + 160 = 360\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n4x = 200 \\\\Rightarrow x = 50\\n$$\\n\\nSo each of the four regions has a central angle of $50^\\\\circ$. Now, the problem says: instead of computing the probability, find $N = \\\\theta + 2700$, where $\\\\theta$ is the total central angle of the shaded regions.\\n\\nBut wait — the problem does not specify which regions are shaded! This seems like a critical omission. However, upon closer reading, it says: \\\"Instead of computing the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region, simply find $N = \\\\theta + 2700$, where $\\\\theta$ is the total central angle in degrees of the shaded regions.\\\"\\n\\nBut still, we don't know which regions are shaded. Unless... perhaps all the regions with central angle $x = 50^\\\\circ$ are shaded? Or maybe the ones with $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$?\\n\\nWait — perhaps there's a misinterpretation. Let's reread.\\n\\n\\\"A circular spinner is divided into six regions, four regions each have a central angle of $x^\\\\circ$, and the remaining regions have central angles of $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$\\\" — but that’s only five regions: four with $x^\\\\circ$, one with $20^\\\\circ$, one with $140^\\\\circ$ — total six regions. So that’s correct.\\n\\nBut again, no information about shading. However, note that the instruction says: \\\"instead of computing the probability... find $N = \\\\theta + 2700$\\\" — implying that $\\\\theta$ is known or can be deduced.\\n\\nWait — unless the shaded regions are the ones mentioned as having $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$? Or maybe the four $x^\\\\circ$ regions?\\n\\nBut no specification. This suggests that perhaps the problem assumes that the shaded regions are those with central angle $x^\\\\circ$ — but that’s an assumption.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe “the shaded region” refers to some configuration implied by the values.\\n\\nWait — let's look at the structure. We found $x = 50$. So the six regions have angles:\\n\\n- Four regions: $50^\\\\circ$ each → $4 \\\\times 50 = 200^\\\\circ$\\n- One region: $20^\\\\circ$\\n- One region: $140^\\\\circ$\\n\\nTotal: $200 + 20 + 140 = 360^\\\\circ$ — correct.\\n\\nNow, perhaps the shaded regions are the four regions of $50^\\\\circ$? Or maybe the two unusual ones?\\n\\nBut the problem doesn’t say. However, notice that the task is not to find the probability, but to compute $N = \\\\theta + 2700$, where $\\\\theta$ is the total central angle of the shaded regions.\\n\\nThis implies that $\\\\theta$ must be determinable from the context. But without knowing which are shaded, it's impossible — unless the shaded regions are specified implicitly.\\n\\nWait — perhaps I missed something. The problem says: \\\"the arrow stops on a shaded region\\\", so there *are* shaded regions, but their identity isn't stated.\\n\\nThis suggests that either:\\n\\n1. There is a figure missing (but this is text-only), or\\n2. The shaded regions are meant to be inferred.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps “shaded region” is a red herring, and we are told to ignore computing probability and just compute $N = \\\\theta + 2700$, but we still need $\\\\theta$.\\n\\nWait — unless the problem is saying: suppose that the shaded regions are the four regions of size $x^\\\\circ$, and we are to compute $\\\\theta$ as their total angle.\\n\\nBut why would we assume that?\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the shaded region is the one with $140^\\\\circ$? That seems arbitrary.\\n\\nWait — perhaps the problem was meant to say that the four regions of $x^\\\\circ$ are shaded? That would make sense, since they are identical.\\n\\nGiven that $x = 50$, then $\\\\theta = 4 \\\\times 50 = 200^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nThen $N = \\\\theta + 2700 = 200 + 2700 = 2900$.\\n\\nBut let's check if any other interpretation makes sense.\\n\\nSuppose the two non-$x$ regions are shaded: $20^\\\\circ + 140^\\\\circ = 160^\\\\circ$, then $N = 160 + 2700 = 2860$.\\n\\nOr if only the $140^\\\\circ$ is shaded: $140 + 2700 = 2840$.\\n\\nBut none of these seem particularly special.\\n\\nWait — perhaps “the shaded region” refers to multiple regions, and the problem expects us to realize that the four equal regions are shaded — common in such problems.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is defective. But let's think differently.\\n\\nWait — perhaps “the shaded region” is not specified because $\\\\theta$ is just the sum of the angles of the regions that are shaded, but we are to express $N$ in terms of $\\\\theta$, but no — we are to compute $N$.\\n\\nUnless the shaded regions are defined by being of size $x^\\\\circ$, and $x$ is determined, so $\\\\theta = 4x = 200$.\\n\\nGiven that, $N = 200 + 2700 = 2900$.\\n\\nI think this is the intended interpretation: the four regions of $x^\\\\circ$ are shaded, so $\\\\theta = 4 \\\\times 50 = 200$, so $N = 200 + 2700 = 2900$.\\n\\nProceeding with that.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe are told that a pair $(m, n)$ is a happy pair if $\\\\gcd(m, n)$ is a perfect square.\\n\\nWe are given that $k$ is a positive integer such that $(205800, 35k)$ is a happy pair, and $k \\\\leq 2940$. We are to find the number of possible values of $k$.\\n\\nFirst, factorize 205800 and 35.\\n\\nStart with 205800.\\n\\n$205800 = 2058 \\\\times 100 = (2 \\\\times 1029) \\\\times (2^2 \\\\times 5^2) = 2^3 \\\\times 5^2 \\\\times 1029$\\n\\nNow 1029: divisible by 3? $1+0+2+9=12$ → yes.\\n\\n$1029 \\\\div 3 = 343$\\n\\n$343 = 7^3$\\n\\nSo $1029 = 3 \\\\times 7^3$\\n\\nThus,\\n\\n$205800 = 2^3 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5^2 \\\\times 7^3$\\n\\nNow $35 = 5 \\\\times 7$\\n\\nSo $35k = 5 \\\\times 7 \\\\times k$\\n\\nNow, $\\\\gcd(205800, 35k) = \\\\gcd(2^3 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 5^2 \\\\cdot 7^3,\\\\ 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot k)$\\n\\nLet $d = \\\\gcd(205800, 35k)$\\n\\nSince $35k = 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot k$, the gcd will depend on the common prime factors between $205800$ and $35k$.\\n\\nThe primes involved are 2, 3, 5, 7.\\n\\nLet $k$ have prime factorization including powers of 2, 3, 5, 7, and possibly others. But since gcd only cares about common primes, and $205800$ has only primes 2,3,5,7, any other prime in $k$ won't affect the gcd.\\n\\nSo without loss of generality, we can assume $k$ is of the form $2^a \\\\cdot 3^b \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7^d$, because other prime factors won't affect the gcd.\\n\\nNow, $35k = 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 2^a \\\\cdot 3^b \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7^d = 2^a \\\\cdot 3^b \\\\cdot 5^{c+1} \\\\cdot 7^{d+1}$\\n\\nNow, $\\\\gcd(205800, 35k) = \\\\gcd(2^3 \\\\cdot 3^1 \\\\cdot 5^2 \\\\cdot 7^3,\\\\ 2^a \\\\cdot 3^b \\\\cdot 5^{c+1} \\\\cdot 7^{d+1})$\\n\\nSo the gcd is:\\n\\n$2^{\\\\min(3,a)} \\\\cdot 3^{\\\\min(1,b)} \\\\cdot 5^{\\\\min(2,c+1)} \\\\cdot 7^{\\\\min(3,d+1)}$\\n\\nWe want this gcd to be a perfect square.\\n\\nSo each exponent in the prime factorization of the gcd must be even (and non-negative, which they are).\\n\\nSo we require:\\n\\n- $\\\\min(3, a)$ is even\\n- $\\\\min(1, b)$ is even\\n- $\\\\min(2, c+1)$ is even\\n- $\\\\min(3, d+1)$ is even\\n\\nNow analyze each condition.\\n\\n1. $\\\\min(3, a)$ is even:\\n\\nPossible values of $\\\\min(3,a)$: since min ≤ 3, possible even values: 0, 2. (Note: 4 is too big)\\n\\n- If $\\\\min(3,a) = 0$: then $a = 0$\\n- If $\\\\min(3,a) = 2$: then $a ≥ 2$, and min is 2 → so $a ≥ 2$, but min(3,a)=2 ⇒ $a = 2$ (since if a≥3, min=3, odd)\\n\\nIf $a ≥ 3$, $\\\\min(3,a) = 3$, which is odd → not allowed.\\n\\nSo possibilities:\\n- $a = 0$: min = 0 (even) → OK\\n- $a = 2$: min = 2 (even) → OK\\n- $a = 1$: min(3,1)=1 → odd → not OK\\n- $a ≥ 3$: min=3 → odd → not OK\\n\\nSo $a = 0$ or $a = 2$\\n\\n2. $\\\\min(1, b)$ is even:\\n\\nPossible values: min ≤ 1 → even possibilities: 0\\n\\nBecause 1 is odd, 0 is even.\\n\\n- $\\\\min(1,b) = 0$ iff $b = 0$\\n- If $b ≥ 1$, $\\\\min(1,b) = 1$ → odd → not allowed\\n\\nSo only possibility: $b = 0$\\n\\n3. $\\\\min(2, c+1)$ is even:\\n\\nPossible even values ≤ 2: 0, 2\\n\\n- $\\\\min(2, c+1) = 0$: then $c+1 = 0$ → $c = -1$ → impossible since $c ≥ 0$\\n- So cannot be 0\\n\\nMust be 2: $\\\\min(2, c+1) = 2$\\n\\nWhich implies $c+1 ≥ 2$ and min is 2 → so $c+1 ≥ 2$ and since min is 2, it means $c+1 ≥ 2$, and the min is 2 only if $c+1 ≥ 2$, but min(2, c+1)=2 iff $c+1 ≥ 2$\\n\\nmin(2, x) = 2 iff $x ≥ 2$\\n\\nSo $c+1 ≥ 2$ → $c ≥ 1$\\n\\nAnd min=2, which is even → good.\\n\\nCould min be 0? No, as above.\\n\\nCould min be 1? min(2,c+1)=1 → when c+1=1 → c=0 → min=1 → odd → not allowed\\n\\nSo only possibility: $c ≥ 1$\\n\\n4. $\\\\min(3, d+1)$ is even:\\n\\nPossible even values ≤ 3: 0, 2\\n\\n- $\\\\min(3, d+1) = 0$: requires $d+1 = 0$ → $d = -1$ → impossible\\n- So cannot be 0\\n\\nMust be 2: $\\\\min(3, d+1) = 2$\\n\\nWhich happens when $d+1 ≥ 2$ and min is 2 → so $d+1 ≥ 2$ and min(3, d+1)=2 → this occurs when $d+1 = 2$ or $d+1 = 2$? Wait:\\n\\nmin(3, x) = 2 when $x = 2$ or $x > 2$? No:\\n\\n- If $x = 2$, min(3,2)=2\\n- If $x = 3$, min(3,3)=3 → odd\\n- If $x = 4$, min(3,4)=3 → odd\\n- Only when $x = 2$, min=2\\n\\nIf $x ≥ 3$, min=3 → odd → not allowed\\n\\nIf $x = 1$, min(3,1)=1 → odd → not allowed\\n\\nIf $x = 0$, min=0 → even, but $d+1=0$ → $d=-1$ → invalid\\n\\nSo only possibility: $d+1 = 2$ → $d = 1$\\n\\nThus, $d = 1$\\n\\nSummary of conditions for $k = 2^a \\\\cdot 3^b \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7^d$:\\n\\n- $a = 0$ or $a = 2$\\n- $b = 0$\\n- $c ≥ 1$\\n- $d = 1$\\n\\nAdditionally, $k ≤ 2940$\\n\\nNow, $k = 2^a \\\\cdot 3^0 \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7^1 = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7$\\n\\nWith $a ∈ {0,2}$, $c ≥ 1$, and $k ≤ 2940$\\n\\nAlso, $k$ is positive integer, so $c ≥ 1$ integer.\\n\\nNow compute maximum possible $c$.\\n\\nCase 1: $a = 0$ → $k = 1 \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7 = 7 \\\\cdot 5^c$\\n\\nSet $7 \\\\cdot 5^c ≤ 2940$\\n\\n$5^c ≤ 2940 / 7 = 420$\\n\\n$5^1 = 5$\\n$5^2 = 25$\\n$5^3 = 125$\\n$5^4 = 625 > 420$ → too big\\n\\nSo $c ≤ 3$\\n\\nSince $c ≥ 1$, $c = 1,2,3$\\n\\nSo three values: $c=1$: $k=7×5=35$\\n$c=2$: $7×25=175$\\n$c=3$: $7×125=875$\\n\\nAll ≤ 2940\\n\\nCase 2: $a = 2$ → $k = 4 \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7 = 28 \\\\cdot 5^c$\\n\\nSet $28 \\\\cdot 5^c ≤ 2940$\\n\\n$5^c ≤ 2940 / 28 = 105$\\n\\n$5^1 = 5$\\n$5^2 = 25$\\n$5^3 = 125 > 105$ → too big\\n\\nSo $c ≤ 2$\\n\\n$c ≥ 1$, so $c=1,2$\\n\\n$c=1$: $k=28×5=140$\\n$c=2$: $k=28×25=700$\\n\\nBoth ≤ 2940\\n\\nNow list all k:\\n\\nFrom case 1: 35, 175, 875\\nFrom case 2: 140, 700\\n\\nAre these all distinct? Yes.\\n\\nSo total 5 values?\\n\\nBut wait: $k ≤ 2940$, and all are well below.\\n\\nBut is that all? Remember, $k$ could have other prime factors? Earlier I assumed $k$ has only primes 2,3,5,7, but actually, $k$ could have other prime factors, say $p$, then $35k = 5×7×k$, and if $k$ has a prime $p ∉ {2,3,5,7}$, then $35k$ has that prime, but $205800$ does not, so $\\\\gcd(205800, 35k)$ is unaffected — because gcd only includes primes common to both.\\n\\nSo adding extra prime factors to $k$ doesn't change the gcd, as long as they are not in 205800.\\n\\nTherefore, $k$ could be multiplied by any integer $m$ such that $m$ is composed of primes other than 2,3,5,7, and $k ≤ 2940$.\\n\\nBut wait — no: if $k$ has an extra prime factor, say 11, then $k$ becomes larger, so the constraint $k ≤ 2940$ may exclude some.\\n\\nBut crucially, the gcd depends only on the exponents of 2,3,5,7 in $k$, not on other primes.\\n\\nSo for the gcd to be a perfect square, the conditions on $a,b,c,d$ (exponents of 2,3,5,7 in $k$) are necessary and sufficient, regardless of other prime factors.\\n\\nTherefore, $k$ can include other prime factors, as long as the exponents of 2,3,5,7 satisfy the conditions, and $k ≤ 2940$.\\n\\nSo $k = 2^a \\\\cdot 3^b \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7^d \\\\cdot m = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7^1 \\\\cdot m$, where $m$ is an integer coprime to 2,3,5,7 (i.e., not divisible by 2,3,5,7), and $a ∈ {0,2}$, $c ≥ 1$, $b=0$, $d=1$.\\n\\nIn other words, $k = (2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7) \\\\cdot m$, with $\\\\gcd(m, 210) = 1$ (since 2×3×5×7=210), and $k ≤ 2940$.\\n\\nFor each fixed $a$ and $c$, we have a base value $k_0 = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7$, and then $k = k_0 \\\\cdot m$, with $m ≥ 1$, $\\\\gcd(m, 210) = 1$, and $k_0 \\\\cdot m ≤ 2940$ → $m ≤ \\\\lfloor 2940 / k_0 \\\\rfloor$\\n\\nAnd $m$ must be composed only of primes ≥ 11, and not 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nSo we need to consider all such $m$ for each valid $(a,c)$ pair.\\n\\nEarlier I only considered $m=1$, but $m$ can be greater than 1, as long as it's coprime to 210 and $k ≤ 2940$.\\n\\nSo we must include all such $m$.\\n\\nSo let's list all possible base $k_0 = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7$ with $a ∈ {0,2}$, $c ≥ 1$, and $k_0 ≤ 2940$ (since $m ≥ 1$)\\n\\nFrom before:\\n\\n- $a=0, c=1$: $k_0 = 1 × 5 × 7 = 35$\\n- $a=0, c=2$: $k_0 = 1 × 25 × 7 = 175$\\n- $a=0, c=3$: $k_0 = 1 × 125 × 7 = 875$\\n- $a=0, c=4$: $5^4=625, 625×7=4375 > 2940$ → too big\\n- $a=2, c=1$: $4 × 5 × 7 = 140$\\n- $a=2, c=2$: $4 × 25 × 7 = 700$\\n- $a=2, c=3$: $4 × 125 × 7 = 3500 > 2940$ → too big\\n\\nSo possible base values: 35, 175, 875, 140, 700\\n\\nFor each, find the number of integers $m ≥ 1$ such that:\\n- $\\\\gcd(m, 210) = 1$\\n- $k_0 \\\\cdot m ≤ 2940$ → $m ≤ \\\\lfloor 2940 / k_0 \\\\rfloor$\\n\\nNote: $m$ must be a positive integer coprime to 210.\\n\\nSo let's compute for each $k_0$:\\n\\n1. $k_0 = 35$:\\n   $m ≤ \\\\lfloor 2940 / 35 \\\\rfloor = \\\\lfloor 84 \\\\rfloor = 84$\\n   Number of $m$ in $1 ≤ m ≤ 84$ with $\\\\gcd(m, 210) = 1$\\n\\n   210 = 2×3×5×7\\n   Use inclusion-exclusion to count numbers ≤84 coprime to 210.\\n\\n   Total numbers: 84\\n\\n   Subtract those divisible by 2,3,5,7:\\n\\n   Let A2: div by 2, A3: div by 3, A5: div by 5, A7: div by 7\\n\\n   |A2| = floor(84/2) = 42\\n   |A3| = floor(84/3) = 28\\n   |A5| = floor(84/5) = 16\\n   |A7| = floor(84/7) = 12\\n\\n   Intersections:\\n   |A2∩A3| = floor(84/6) = 14\\n   |A2∩A5| = floor(84/10) = 8\\n   |A2∩A7| = floor(84/14) = 6\\n   |A3∩A5| = floor(84/15) = 5\\n   |A3∩A7| = floor(84/21) = 4\\n   |A5∩A7| = floor(84/35) = 2\\n\\n   Triple intersections:\\n   |A2∩A3∩A5| = floor(84/30) = 2\\n   |A2∩A3∩A7| = floor(84/42) = 2\\n   |A2∩A5∩A7| = floor(84/70) = 1\\n   |A3∩A5∩A7| = floor(84/105) = 0\\n\\n   Quadruple: |A2∩A3∩A5∩A7| = floor(84/210) = 0\\n\\n   Inclusion-exclusion:\\n   |A2 ∪ A3 ∪ A5 ∪ A7| = \\n   (42+28+16+12) - (14+8+6+5+4+2) + (2+2+1+0) - 0\\n   = (98) - (39) + (5) = 98 - 39 = 59; 59 + 5 = 64?

Collision!\\n\\nk = 35 * 4 = 140\\nk = 140 * 1 = 140\\nSame k!\\n\\nBut is m=4 allowed for k0=35? m must be coprime to 210. gcd(4,210)=2 ≠1 → not coprime! So m=4 is not allowed.\\n\\nSimilarly, for k0=35, m must be coprime to 210, so m cannot be even, not mult of 3,5,7.\\n\\nSo m=4 is even → gcd=2 → not allowed.\\n\\nSimilarly, k=140 can be written as:\\n- k0=140, m=1\\n- or k0=35, m=4 → but m=4 not coprime to 210 → invalid\\n\\nSimilarly, is there any other overlap?\\n\\nFor example, k0=35, m=1: k=35\\nk0=140, m= something: minimum 140>35\\nk0=175>140\\nSo no\\n\\nk0=35, m=11: k=35*11=385\\nk0=140, m= something: 140*1=140, 140*2=280, 140*3=420>385, but m=3 not coprime? But anyway 280≠385\\n\\nk0=175, m=1:175\\nk0=35, m=5: but m=5, gcd(5,210)=5≠1 → not allowed\\nm=7: gcd=7≠1 → not allowed\\nm=1:35, m=11:385, etc.\\n\\nk0=35, m=5 not allowed\\n\\nk0=35, m=1:35\\nk0=140, m=1:140\\nk0=175, m=1:175\\nk0=700, m=1:700\\nk0=875, m=1:875\\n\\nAll different\\n\\nk0=35, m=11: 35*11=385\\nk0=35, m=13:455\\netc.\\n\\nk0=140, m=11:140*11=1540\\n\\nIs 1540 equal to any other? k0=35, m=44: 35*44=1540, but m=44, gcd(44,210): 44=4*11, 210=2*..., gcd at least 2 → not 1 → not allowed\\n\\nSimilarly, any k from k0=35 must be 35 times m with gcd(m,210)=1, so m odd, not mult of 3,5,7\\n\\nk from k0=140: 140 * m' with gcd(m',210)=1\\n\\n140 = 4*5*7 = 2^2 *5*7\\n35 = 5*7\\nSo k = 35 * m = 5*7*m\\nk = 140 * m' = 4*5*7*m' = 2^2 *5*7*m'\\n\\nFor them to be equal: 5*7*m = 2^2 *5*7*m' → m = 4 m'\\nBut m must be coprime to 210, so not divisible by 2, but 4m' is divisible by 4 → contradiction\\nSo no overlap\\n\\nSimilarly, k0=175 = 25*7 = 5^2 *7\\nk = 175 * m'' = 5^2 *7 * m''\\nk from k0=35: 5*7*m → set equal: 5*7*m = 5^2 *7 * m'' → m = 5 m''\\nBut m must be coprime to 5, but 5m'' divisible by 5 → contradiction\\n\\nk0=700 = 4*25*7 = 2^2 *5^2 *7\\nk = 700 * m''' = 2^2 *5^2 *7 * m'''\\nk from k0=35: 5*7*m → 5*7*m = 2^2 *5^2 *7 * m''' → m = 4*5 * m''' = 20 m'''\\nBut m must be coprime to 2 and 5, but 20m''' divisible by 2 and 5 → contradiction\\n\\nk0=875 = 125*7 = 5^3 *7\\nk = 875 * m'''' = 5^3 *7 * m''''\\nk from k0=35: 5*7*m = 5^3 *7 * m'''' → m = 25 m'''' → m divisible by 25 → by 5 → not coprime\\n\\nSimilarly, k0=140 and k0=175: 140 m' = 175 m'' → 4*5*7 m' = 25*7 m'' → 20 m' = 25 m'' → 4 m' = 5 m''\\nSo m' multiple of 5, m'' multiple of 4 → but m' must be coprime to 5 → contradiction\\n\\nOther pairs similarly impossible\\n\\nSo all the k values generated are distinct\\n\\nTherefore, total number is sum: 20 (for k0=35) + 3 (k0=175) + 1 (k0=875) + 5 (k0=140) + 1 (k0=700) = 20+3=23, +1=24, +5=29, +1=30\\n\\nSo 30 possible k\\n\\nBut let me double-check the counts.\\n\\nFor k0=35, m≤84, gcd(m,210)=1: we computed 20\\n\\nVerify: φ(210) = φ(2*3*5*7) = 210 * (1-1/2)*(1-1/3)*(1-1/5)*(1-1/7) = 210 * 1/2 * 2/3 * 4/5 * 6/7\\nCompute: 210 * 1/2 = 105\\n105 * 2/3 = 70\\n70 * 4/5 = 56\\n56 * 6/7 = 48\\nSo φ(210)=48, meaning 48 numbers less than 210 coprime to 210.\\n\\nBut we need up to 84.\\n\\nNumber of integers ≤84 coprime to 210.\\n\\nSince 84 < 210, we can use inclusion-exclusion as before.\\n\\nWe had: total 84\\nMinus div by 2,3,5,7: used inclusion-exclusion and got 64 in the union, so 84-64=20\\n\\nList small ones: 1,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83\\n\\nCount: 1,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83\\n\\nThat's 20 — yes.\\n\\nk0=175, m≤16: m=1,11,13 — three, as listed\\n\\nk0=875, m≤3: only m=1\\n\\nk0=140, m≤21: m=1,11,13,17,19 — five\\n\\nk0=700, m≤4: only m=1\\n\\nTotal: 20+3+1+5+1=30\\n\\nSo answer should be 30.\\n\\nBut earlier I thought 5, but missed the m multipliers.\\n\\nYes, because k can have other prime factors, as long as they don't affect the gcd, which they don't if new primes.\\n\\nSo final answers:\\n\\nProblem 1: N = 2900\\nProblem 2: 30\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2900\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"30\"\n}",
