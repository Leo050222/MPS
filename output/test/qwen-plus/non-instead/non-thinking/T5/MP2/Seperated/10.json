But we're told to consider **non-constant** solutions, so we discard constant functions.\\n- Therefore, to avoid $f$ being constant, we must have:\\n\\n$$\\nf(0) = 0\\n$$\\n\\nThen the above gives $f(0) = f(0)^3 \\\\Rightarrow 0 = 0$, consistent.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Try $x = 0$\\n\\nSet $x = 0$ in (1):\\n\\n$$\\nf(0 \\\\cdot f(y) + y^3) = y f(0) + f(y)^3 \\\\Rightarrow f(y^3) = 0 + f(y)^3\\n$$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nf(y^3) = f(y)^3 \\\\tag{2}\\n$$\\n\\nThis is useful. It relates the value at $y^3$ to the cube of the value at $y$.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Try $y = 1$\\n\\nLet’s denote $a = f(1)$. We want to compute $k = a + 1$.\\n\\nSet $y = 1$ in (1):\\n\\n$$\\nf(xf(1) + 1^3) = 1 \\\\cdot f(x) + f(1)^3 \\\\Rightarrow f(a x + 1) = f(x) + a^3 \\\\tag{3}\\n$$\\n\\nThis is a functional equation relating $f(ax + 1)$ to $f(x)$.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Use (2) with $y = 1$: \\n\\nFrom (2): $f(1^3) = f(1)^3 \\\\Rightarrow f(1) = f(1)^3$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\na = a^3 \\\\Rightarrow a^3 - a = 0 \\\\Rightarrow a(a^2 - 1) = 0\\n$$\\n\\nThus $a = 0$, $a = 1$, or $a = -1$\\n\\nWe are to consider **non-constant** $f$, so let's test which of these are possible.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Case 1: $a = f(1) = 0$\\n\\nThen from (3): $f(0 \\\\cdot x + 1) = f(x) + 0 \\\\Rightarrow f(1) = f(x)$\\n\\nBut $f(1) = 0$, so $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$, i.e., $f \\\\equiv 0$, constant — discard.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Case 2: $a = 1$\\n\\nThen (3) becomes:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x + 1) = f(x) + 1\\n$$\\n\\nSo $f$ satisfies $f(x+1) = f(x) + 1$. This suggests $f(x) = x + c$, but let's see.\\n\\nIterating, $f(x+n) = f(x) + n$ for integers $n$.\\n\\nAlso from (2): $f(y^3) = f(y)^3$\\n\\nTry to assume $f(x) = x$. Let's test if this works.\\n\\nTry $f(x) = x$:\\n\\nLHS: $f(xf(y) + y^3) = f(xy + y^3) = xy + y^3$\\n\\nRHS: $y f(x) + f(y)^3 = yx + y^3$\\n\\nEqual! So $f(x) = x$ is a solution.\\n\\nIt's non-constant, $f(1) = 1$, so $k = 1 + 1 = 2$\\n\\nIs this the only non-constant solution?\\n\\nCheck $a = -1$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Case 3: $a = -1$\\n\\nThen (3): $f(-x + 1) = f(x) + (-1)^3 = f(x) - 1$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nf(1 - x) = f(x) - 1 \\\\tag{4}\\n$$\\n\\nNow use (2): $f(y^3) = f(y)^3$\\n\\nTry to find $f(0)$: already know $f(0) = 0$\\n\\nSet $x = 1$ in (4): $f(1 - 1) = f(1) - 1 \\\\Rightarrow f(0) = -1 - 1 = -2$, but $f(0) = 0$, contradiction.\\n\\nWait: $f(1) = -1$, so (4) gives:\\n\\n$f(0) = f(1) - 1 = -1 - 1 = -2$, but $f(0) = 0$, contradiction.\\n\\nSo $a = -1$ is impossible.\\n\\nThus only possible non-constant solution has $f(1) = 1$, giving $k = 1 + 1 = 2$\\n\\nAre there other non-constant solutions?\\n\\nSuppose $f(x) = x$ works. Are there others?\\n\\nFrom $f(x+1) = f(x) + 1$, and $f(y^3) = f(y)^3$, suppose we define $g(x) = f(x) - x$, then $g(x+1) = g(x)$, so periodic with period 1.\\n\\nBut also $f(y^3) = f(y)^3$\\n\\nAssume $f(y) = y$, it works.\\n\\nSuppose another solution exists. But often in such equations with $f(x+1)=f(x)+1$ and multiplicative/cubic condition, only linear solutions work.\\n\\nBut since the problem only asks for $k = f(1) + 1$ for **the** non-constant function (implying perhaps uniqueness), and we found $f(1) = 1$ is the only possibility, then $k = 2$.\\n\\nThus answer to Problem 1 is $k = 2$\\n\\n---\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe are asked: Does there exist:\\n\\n- A finite set $A$ of positive integers, $|A| \\\\geq 2$\\n- An infinite set $B$ of positive integers\\n- Such that:\\n  1. Any two distinct elements in $A+B = \\\\{a+b \\\\mid a \\\\in A, b \\\\in B\\\\}$ are coprime\\n  2. For any coprime positive integers $m, n$, there exists $x \\\\in A+B$ such that $x \\\\equiv n \\\\pmod{m}$\\n\\nWe need to determine whether such sets exist.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Condition 1: All distinct elements of $A+B$ are coprime\\n\\nThat means: for any $a_1, a_2 \\\\in A$, $b_1, b_2 \\\\in B$, if $(a_1,b_1) \\\\ne (a_2,b_2)$, then $\\\\gcd(a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2) = 1$\\n\\nNote: even for fixed $b$, varying $a$, the sums $a + b$ must be pairwise coprime.\\n\\nBut $A$ is finite, say $A = \\\\{a_1, \\\\dots, a_k\\\\}$, $k \\\\geq 2$\\n\\nFor a fixed $b$, the numbers $a_i + b$ and $a_j + b$ differ by $a_i - a_j$, a fixed nonzero integer.\\n\\nBut can two such numbers be coprime to each other and to all others across different $b$?\\n\\nBut more critically: $A+B$ is infinite (since $B$ is infinite), and we require that **every pair of distinct elements** in $A+B$ are coprime.\\n\\nSo $A+B$ is an infinite set of positive integers where any two distinct elements are coprime.\\n\\nIs that possible?\\n\\nYes — for example, take $B$ such that $a + b$ are distinct primes. But we need more structure.\\n\\nBut here’s a problem: fix two elements $a_1, a_2 \\\\in A$, $a_1 \\\\ne a_2$\\n\\nConsider the sequence $x_b = a_1 + b$, $y_b = a_2 + b$ for $b \\\\in B$\\n\\nAs $b$ grows, $x_b$ and $y_b$ grow, and $\\\\gcd(x_b, y_b) = \\\\gcd(a_1 + b, a_2 + b) = \\\\gcd(a_1 - a_2, a_2 + b)$\\n\\nSince $a_1 - a_2 \\\\ne 0$, this gcd divides $|a_1 - a_2|$, a fixed number.\\n\\nSo $\\\\gcd(a_1 + b, a_2 + b)$ divides $d = |a_1 - a_2| > 0$\\n\\nSo unless this gcd is 1, they are not coprime.\\n\\nBut we can possibly choose $b$ so that $a_2 + b$ is coprime to $d$, then $\\\\gcd = 1$\\n\\nBut the issue is stronger: we need **all** pairs from $A+B$ to be coprime, including $a_1 + b_1$ and $a_1 + b_2$ for $b_1 \\\\ne b_2$\\n\\nSo consider two different $b_1, b_2 \\\\in B$, and same $a$: $x = a + b_1$, $y = a + b_2$\\n\\nThen $\\\\gcd(x,y) = \\\\gcd(a + b_1, a + b_2) = \\\\gcd(a + b_1, b_2 - b_1)$\\n\\nThis divides $|b_2 - b_1|$, but not necessarily bounded.\\n\\nBut now the critical point: $A+B$ is infinite, and we require that every two distinct elements are coprime.\\n\\nCan an infinite set $S \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{Z}^+$ have the property that any two distinct elements are coprime?\\n\\nYes — e.g., the set of all primes.\\n\\nBut here, $A+B$ has structure: it's a sumset of a finite set and an infinite set.\\n\\nKey idea: such a sumset cannot consist of pairwise coprime elements unless very restricted.\\n\\nBut more importantly: consider modulo small primes.\\n\\nSuppose $p$ is a prime. Can $p$ divide more than one element of $A+B$?\\n\\nNo — because if $p \\\\mid x$ and $p \\\\mid y$ for $x \\\\ne y \\\\in A+B$, then $\\\\gcd(x,y) \\\\geq p > 1$, violating condition.\\n\\nTherefore, **each prime divides at most one element of $A+B$**.\\n\\nHence, $A+B$ contains at most one even number, at most one multiple of 3, etc.\\n\\nSo $A+B$ is an infinite set where no prime divides more than one element.\\n\\nBut now consider the density.\\n\\nBut more simply: fix $a \\\\in A$. As $b$ varies over infinite $B$, $a + b$ takes infinitely many values.\\n\\nBut each such $a + b$ must be divisible by at most one prime (no: the number itself can be composite, but no prime can divide two different elements).\\n\\nBut still, the set $a + B = \\\\{a + b \\\\mid b \\\\in B\\\\}$ is infinite, and all its elements are in $A+B$, and must be pairwise coprime (since distinct elements of $A+B$).\\n\\nSo $a + B$ is an infinite set of integers greater than $a$, all pairwise coprime.\\n\\nIs that possible?\\n\\nYes — e.g., take $B$ such that $a + b$ are distinct primes. But we have multiple $a$.\\n\\nBut now the second condition: $A+B$ must be **dense in the coprime residue classes**: for any coprime $m,n$, there exists $x \\\\in A+B$ with $x \\\\equiv n \\\\pmod{m}$\\n\\nThis is a strong **density** condition: $A+B$ intersects every coprime residue class modulo every $m$.\\n\\nBut now we have a contradiction in terms.\\n\\nOn one hand, $A+B$ must be very sparse: no two elements share a common prime factor, so it's “thin”.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it must be dense modulo every $m$: hitting every $n$ with $\\\\gcd(n,m)=1$.\\n\\nBut more concretely: fix a prime $p$. Since $A+B$ must contain an element $\\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{p}$, $\\\\equiv 2 \\\\pmod{p}$, ..., up to $\\\\equiv p-1 \\\\pmod{p}$ (as long as coprime, which they are), so $A+B$ must hit all nonzero residues mod $p$.\\n\\nBut $A$ is finite, say size $k$, $B$ infinite.\\n\\nThen $A+B \\\\pmod{p}$ is contained in the sumset $A + B \\\\pmod{p}$\\n\\nBut $B$ could be chosen to make $B \\\\pmod{p}$ large.\\n\\nBut the key obstruction comes from the coprimality condition.\\n\\nRecall: no prime $q$ can divide two different elements of $A+B$.\\n\\nIn particular, for a fixed prime $q$, at most one element of $A+B$ is divisible by $q$.\\n\\nNow consider the density of $A+B$.\\n\\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the second condition implies that $A+B$ is dense in the profinite topology — it hits every coprime residue class.\\n\\nBut such a set must have positive density in some sense, or at least intersect every arithmetic progression with coprime difference.\\n\\nBut our set $A+B$ has the property that its elements are pairwise coprime — hence, very sparse.\\n\\nMore precisely: the number of elements of $A+B$ up to $X$ is at most the number of integers up to $X$ with no prime factor dividing more than one such element.\\n\\nBut actually, since each prime divides at most one element, the entire set $A+B$ must consist of numbers that are either 1 or prime powers, and no prime repeats.\\n\\nBut even stronger: if an element is composite, say $x = pq$, with $p,q$ distinct primes, then $p$ divides only $x$, $q$ divides only $x$, fine.\\n\\nBut the real issue is the combination with the modulus condition.\\n\\nHere’s a better argument:\\n\\nSuppose such $A$ and $B$ exist.\\n\\nLet $p$ be any prime larger than $\\\\max A - \\\\min A$.\\n\\nSince $A$ has at least two elements, let $a_1, a_2 \\\\in A$, $a_1 < a_2$\\n\\nLet $d = a_2 - a_1 > 0$, $d < p$\\n\\nNow, by condition 2, there exists $x \\\\in A+B$ such that $x \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{p}$\\n\\nSimilarly, there exists $y \\\\in A+B$ such that $y \\\\equiv 1 + d \\\\pmod{p}$\\n\\nNow, $x = a + b$, $y = a' + b'$ for some $a,a' \\\\in A$, $b,b' \\\\in B$\\n\\nSuppose $b = b'$, same $b$. Then $x - y = a - a'$, so $x \\\\equiv y + (a - a') \\\\pmod{p}$\\n\\nBut we have $x \\\\equiv 1$, $y \\\\equiv 1 + d$, so $1 \\\\equiv 1 + d + (a - a') \\\\pmod{p} \\\\Rightarrow a - a' \\\\equiv -d \\\\pmod{p}$\\n\\nBut $|a - a'| < p$, so equality: $a - a' = -d = -(a_2 - a_1)$\\n\\nPossible.\\n\\nBut we don't know if $x$ and $y$ come from same $b$.\\n\\nAlternate approach:\\n\\nUse the fact that $A+B$ must contain elements congruent to every residue coprime to $m$, for every $m$.\\n\\nIn particular, for a large prime $p$, $A+B$ must contain an element $\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p}$? No — only if $\\\\gcd(0,p)=p \\\\ne 1$, so $n=0$ is not coprime to $m=p$, so we don't require $x \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p}$\\n\\nWe only require $x \\\\equiv n \\\\pmod{m}$ when $\\\\gcd(n,m)=1$\\n\\nSo $A+B$ avoids multiples of $m$ only when $n$ is not coprime, but it may still contain multiples of $p$, as long as $x \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p}$ is not required.\\n\\nBut earlier: each prime $p$ can divide at most one element of $A+B$, because if $p \\\\mid x$ and $p \\\\mid y$, $x \\\\ne y$, then $\\\\gcd(x,y) \\\\geq p > 1$, contradiction.\\n\\nSo for each prime $p$, at most one element of $A+B$ is divisible by $p$.\\n\\nNow, how many elements of $A+B$ are there up to $X$?\\n\\nSince $B$ is infinite, $A+B$ is infinite.\\n\\nBut now consider the natural density.\\n\\nThe condition that every coprime residue class is hit means that $A+B$ is **relatively dense** in the integers with respect to coprime conditions.\\n\\nIn particular, for a large prime $p$, the set $A+B$ must intersect each of the $p-1$ nonzero residue classes mod $p$ (since $\\\\gcd(n,p)=1$ for $n=1,\\\\dots,p-1$)\\n\\nSo $|A+B \\\\pmod{p}| \\\\geq p-1$, i.e., $A+B$ hits at least $p-1$ residue classes mod $p$\\n\\nBut $A+B \\\\pmod{p} \\\\subseteq (A \\\\pmod{p}) + (B \\\\pmod{p})$\\n\\n$A$ has fixed size $k = |A| \\\\geq 2$\\n\\nSo $|(A+B) \\\\pmod{p}| \\\\leq |A| \\\\cdot |B \\\\pmod{p}| \\\\leq k \\\\cdot p$\\n\\nBut we need it to cover $p-1$ classes, which is fine.\\n\\nBut more constraining: since $A$ is fixed, $A \\\\pmod{p}$ has size at most $k$\\n\\nThen $A+B \\\\pmod{p}$ is contained in a union of $k$ shifts of $B \\\\pmod{p}$\\n\\nTo cover $p-1$ residue classes, $B \\\\pmod{p}$ must be large.\\n\\nBut now the key: for each prime $p$, at most one element of $A+B$ is divisible by $p$\\n\\nSo the number of elements of $A+B$ up to $X$ that are divisible by some prime $\\\\leq Y$ is at most $\\\\pi(Y)$, the number of primes $\\\\leq Y$\\n\\nBut most integers up to $X$ are divisible by some small prime.\\n\\nIn fact, the number of integers up to $X$ not divisible by any prime $\\\\leq Y$ is about $X / \\\\log Y$ by sieve methods (roughly).\\n\\nBut our set $S = A+B$ has the property that for each prime $p$, at most one element of $S$ is divisible by $p$\\n\\nTherefore, the number of elements of $S$ up to $X$ is at most the number of primes $p$ such that $p \\\\leq X$, plus possibly 1 (for units, but all are positive integers >0)\\n\\nWait: each element of $S$ can be divisible by many primes, but each prime divides at most one element of $S$\\n\\nSo the total number of prime factors (with multiplicity) across all elements of $S$ up to $X$ is constrained.\\n\\nBut more simply: associate to each element $s \\\\in S$ the set of prime divisors of $s$. These sets are pairwise disjoint, because if a prime $p$ divides two elements, contradiction.\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of distinct primes dividing elements of $S$ is equal to the sum over $s \\\\in S$ of $\\\\omega(s)$, but actually, since primes don't repeat, the total number of primes used is at least the number of elements of $S$ (if each has at least one prime factor), and at most the sum of $\\\\Omega(s)$\\n\\nBut minimally, each $s > 1$ has at least one prime divisor, and all these prime divisors are distinct across $S$\\n\\nTherefore, if $S$ has $N$ elements, then there are at least $N$ distinct primes dividing them (one per element, at least)\\n\\nBut there are only $\\\\pi(X)$ primes $\\\\leq X$, and all elements of $S \\\\cap [1,X]$ are composed of distinct primes, so $|S \\\\cap [1,X]| \\\\leq \\\\pi(X) + 1$ (allowing for $s=1$, but $A,B$ are positive integers, so $a+b \\\\geq 2$, so no 1)\\n\\nActually, minimum $a+b \\\\geq 1+1=2$\\n\\nSo $|S \\\\cap [1,X]| \\\\leq \\\\pi(X)$, because each element requires a unique prime divisor, and there are only $\\\\pi(X)$ primes $\\\\leq X$, and each element $\\\\geq 2$ has a prime divisor $\\\\leq s \\\\leq X$\\n\\nThus:\\n\\n$$\\n|S \\\\cap [1,X]| \\\\leq \\\\pi(X) \\\\sim \\\\frac{X}{\\\\log X}\\n$$\\n\\nSo $S = A+B$ has size $O(X / \\\\log X)$ up to $X$\\n\\nBut now, $A$ is finite, so $|A+B \\\\cap [1,X]| \\\\leq |A| \\\\cdot |B \\\\cap [1,X]|$\\n\\nBut more importantly, we have a lower bound from the density condition.\\n\\nWe need that for every $m$, and every $n$ coprime to $m$, there is $x \\\\in S$ with $x \\\\equiv n \\\\pmod{m}$\\n\\nThis means that $S$ intersects every coprime residue class modulo every $m$\\n\\nIn particular, for a fixed $m$, the number of residue classes mod $m$ that $S$ hits is at least $\\\\phi(m)$\\n\\nBut for $S$ to hit all $\\\\phi(m)$ classes, it must have at least $\\\\phi(m)$ elements, but that's not helpful.\\n\\nThe issue is asymptotic density.\\n\\nA theorem in additive combinatorics or number theory: a set that is a sumset $A+B$ with $A$ finite cannot be too sparse unless $B$ is structured.\\n\\nBut more directly: suppose $|A| = k$\\n\\nThen $A+B$ has asymptotic upper density at most $k$ times that of $B$\\n\\nBut we have $|S \\\\cap [1,X]| \\\\leq C X / \\\\log X$\\n\\nNow, can such a set satisfy the covering condition?\\n\\nConsider $m$ large, say $m = p$ a large prime.\\n\\nWe need $S$ to intersect each of the $p-1$ nonzero residue classes mod $p$\\n\\nThe number of elements of $S$ up to, say, $2p$, is at most $\\\\pi(2p) \\\\sim 2p / \\\\log p$\\n\\nBut we need at least $p-1$ elements to hit $p-1$ classes, unless one element hits multiple classes, but each element is in one class.\\n\\nTo hit $p-1$ different residue classes mod $p$, we need at least $p-1$ distinct elements of $S$ that are $\\\\leq$ some bound.\\n\\nBut the smallest representatives of the residue classes are $1,2,\\\\dots,p-1$, so we need elements of $S$ that are at least up to $p-1$, but could be larger.\\n\\nHowever, an element $x \\\\in S$ with $x \\\\equiv r \\\\pmod{p}$ could be $r, r+p, r+2p, \\\\dots$\\n\\nTo minimize size, we might have small representatives.\\n\\nBut the problem is that $S$ has only about $X / \\\\log X$ elements up to $X$\\n\\nFor $X = p$, $|S \\\\cap [1,p]| \\\\leq \\\\pi(p) \\\\sim p / \\\\log p$\\n\\nBut we need $p-1$ residue classes mod $p$ to be represented by elements of $S$\\n\\nEach element $s \\\\in S$ represents one residue class mod $p$\\n\\nSo we need at least $p-1$ elements in $S$ whose values mod $p$ are all distinct and nonzero\\n\\nThese elements could be larger than $p$, e.g., in $[p+1, 2p]$, etc.\\n\\nThe number of elements of $S$ in $[1, Np]$ is at most $\\\\pi(Np) \\\\sim Np / \\\\log(Np)$\\n\\nTo have $p-1$ such elements, we need $Np / \\\\log(Np) \\\\geq p-1$, so $N / \\\\log(Np) \\\\geq 1 - 1/p$, so $N \\\\gtrapprox \\\\log(Np)$\\n\\nWhich is satisfied for $N$ large, say $N = \\\\log p$, then $Np / \\\\log(Np) \\\\sim (p \\\\log p) / \\\\log p = p$, which is greater than $p-1$\\n\\nSo asymptotically, it's possible to have enough elements.\\n\\nBut the issue is not the count, but the distribution.\\n\\nHowever, there is a deeper conflict.\\n\\nRecall that $A$ is finite, so $A+B$ is a union of $|A|$ translates of $B$\\n\\nSay $A = \\\\{a_1, \\\\dots, a_k\\\\}$, then $S = \\\\bigcup_{i=1}^k (a_i + B)$\\n\\nNow, each $a_i + B$ is a translate of $B$\\n\\nNow, the condition that all elements in $S$ are pairwise coprime implies that:\\n\\n- Within each $a_i + B$, all elements are pairwise coprime\\n- Between different $a_i + B$ and $a_j + B$, all cross elements are coprime\\n\\nIn particular, for fixed $i$, $a_i + B$ is an infinite set of integers, all pairwise coprime.\\n\\nIs that possible?\\n\\nYes — e.g., if $B$ is chosen so that $a_i + b$ are distinct primes.\\n\\nBut now the modulus condition: for any coprime $m,n$, there exists $x \\\\in S$ with $x \\\\equiv n \\\\pmod{m}$\\n\\nThis means that $S$ is dense in the profinite integers, specifically in the units.\\n\\nBut now, since $S = \\\\bigcup_{i=1}^k (a_i + B)$, and $k$ is finite, this union must cover all coprime residue classes.\\n\\nBut each $a_i + B$ is a single translate of $B$, so its behavior mod $m$ depends on $B \\\\pmod{m}$\\n\\nSuppose that $B$ has some structure.\\n\\nBut the pairwise coprimality severely restricts $B$.\\n\\nFor example, within $a_i + B$, the elements $a_i + b$ for $b \\\\in B$ must be pairwise coprime.\\n\\nSo for $b_1 \\\\ne b_2$, $\\\\gcd(a_i + b_1, a_i + b_2) = \\\\gcd(a_i + b_1, b_1 - b_2) = 1$\\n\\nSo $a_i + b_1$ must be coprime to $b_1 - b_2$ for all $b_2 \\\\ne b_1$\\n\\nSince $B$ is infinite, $b_1 - b_2$ can be any integer (in absolute value) as $b_2$ varies, but not quite.\\n\\nBut for fixed $b_1$, $a_i + b_1$ must be coprime to infinitely many differences $b_1 - b_2$, which could cover many integers.\\n\\nIn particular, if $B$ has bounded gaps, then $a_i + b_1$ must be coprime to small integers, hence must be $\\\\pm1$, impossible for large $b_1$.\\n\\nBut $B$ could be sparse.\\n\\nSuppose $B$ grows very fast.\\n\\nFor example, define $B$ recursively, choosing $b_n$ very large, so that $a_i + b_n$ is prime and larger than all previous elements, and coprime to all previous $a_j + b_m$\\n\\nThis is possible by Chinese Remainder Theorem and Dirichlet.\\n\\nSo we can construct $A+B$ to consist of distinct primes, pairwise coprime.\\n\\nBut can we also satisfy the density condition?\\n\\nThe density condition requires that for every $m,n$ coprime, there is $x \\\\in A+B$ with $x \\\\equiv n \\\\pmod{m}$\\n\\nIf we construct $A+B$ as a set of primes, we need that the set of primes in $A+B$ includes at least one in every coprime residue class.\\n\\nBut by Dirichlet, every coprime residue class contains infinitely many primes, so in principle, we could include one in each.\\n\\nBut the issue is that $A+B$ is a finite union of translates of $B$\\n\\nSpecifically, $S = \\\\bigcup_{i=1}^k (a_i + B)$\\n\\nSo the entire set $S$ is contained in $k$ arithmetic progressions (if $B$ is an AP), but $B$ doesn't have to be.\\n\\nBut $B$ is arbitrary infinite set.\\n\\nCan we choose $B$ such that $\\\\bigcup_{i=1}^k (a_i + B)$ contains a representative of every coprime residue class?\\n\\nYes — for example, enumerate all pairs $(m,n)$ with $\\\\gcd(m,n)=1$, and for each, pick a prime $p \\\\equiv n \\\\pmod{m}$, large enough, not dividing any previous element, and assign it to some $a_i + b$, i.e., set $b = p - a_i$\\n\\nBut we need $b$ to be positive integer, and $B$ to be a set, so no duplicates.\\n\\nAlso, we need that for the same $b$, $a_i + b$ and $a_j + b$ are both in $S$, but we only add one $b$ at a time.\\n\\nBetter: build $B$ incrementally.\\n\\nStart with empty $B$.\\n\\nAt each step, consider the smallest $m$ and $n$ coprime such that no $x \\\\in A+B$ yet satisfies $x \\\\equiv n \\\\pmod{m}$\\n\\nWe need to add some $b$ such that for some $a_i$, $a_i + b \\\\equiv n \\\\pmod{m}$, i.e., $b \\\\equiv n - a_i \\\\pmod{m}$\\n\\nChoose $i$ such that this is possible, which it is.\\n\\nThen choose $b$ large enough so that:\\n\\n- $b >$ all current $b'$ in $B$\\n- $a_i + b$ is prime\\n- $a_i + b$ is larger than all current elements of $A+B$\\n- $a_i + b$ is coprime to all current elements of $A+B$ (which is automatic if it's a new prime larger than all previous)\\n- For other $a_j$, $a_j + b$ must also be coprime to all existing elements and to $a_i + b$\\n\\nBut $a_j + b$ might be composite, but as long as $\\\\gcd(a_j + b, x) = 1$ for all $x \\\\in A+B$, $x \\\\ne a_j + b$\\n\\nWhen we add a new $b$, we add $k$ new elements: $a_1 + b, \\\\dots, a_k + b$\\n\\nWe need all of these to be pairwise coprime, and coprime to all previously added elements.\\n\\nPairwise: $\\\\gcd(a_i + b, a_j + b) = \\\\gcd(a_i - a_j, a_j + b)$, which divides $|a_i - a_j|$, a fixed number.\\n\\nSo if we choose $b$ such that $a_j + b$ is coprime to $|a_i - a_j|$ for all $i,j$, which is possible by avoiding finitely many residue classes.\\n\\nAlso, each $a_i + b$ must be coprime to all previously added elements.\\n\\nPreviously added elements are finite, say set $T$.\\n\\nFor each $a_i + b$, we need $a_i + b \\\\notin T$ (but it's new), and $\\\\gcd(a_i + b, t) = 1$ for all $t \\\\in T$\\n\\nSince $T$ is finite, the product $P = \\\\prod_{t \\\\in T} t$ is fixed.\\n\\nWe need $a_i + b$ coprime to $P$, i.e., $a_i + b \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p}$ for each prime $p \\\\mid P$\\n\\nFinitely many forbidden residues.\\n\\nAlso, we want $a_i + b$ to be prime, but not necessary; just need it coprime to all other elements.\\n\\nBut to ensure $\\\\gcd(a_i + b, a_j + b) = 1$, as above, we can choose $b$ so that $a_j + b$ is coprime to $d_{ij} = |a_i - a_j|$ for all $i,j$\\n\\nAnd for each $t \\\\in T$, avoid $a_i + b \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p}$ for $p \\\\mid t$\\n\\nFinitely many constraints.\\n\\nAlso, we have the congruence requirement: for some $i$, $a_i + b \\\\equiv n \\\\pmod{m}$ for the target $n,m$\\n\\nSo we need $b \\\\equiv n - a_i \\\\pmod{m}$ for some $i$\\n\\nWe can choose which $i$ to satisfy the congruence.\\n\\nFor that $i$, set the congruence $b \\\\equiv n - a_i \\\\pmod{m}$\\n\\nThen combine with the other congruences to avoid bad residues.\\n\\nBy Chinese Remainder Theorem, since all moduli are fixed at this step, we can find $b$ satisfying all the required congruences, and then choose the smallest such $b$ larger than all previous, and set it.\\n\\nThen add $b$ to $B$, and add all $a_i + b$ to $S = A+B$\\n\\nNow, check pairwise gcd:\\n\\n- Between two new elements: $\\\\gcd(a_i + b, a_j + b) \\\\mid |a_i - a_j|$, and we ensured $a_j + b$ coprime to $|a_i - a_j|$ by construction, so gcd=1\\n- Between a new element and an old one: we ensured $a_i + b$ coprime to all old $t \\\\in T$ by avoiding prime factors\\n\\nSo yes, all good.\\n\\nWe also satisfy the congruence requirement for that $(m,n)$\\n\\nProceeding through all $(m,n)$ pairs, we eventually satisfy all congruence requirements.\\n\\nAnd $B$ is infinite.\\n\\n$A$ is finite, size at least 2.\\n\\nAnd all distinct elements of $A+B$ are coprime by construction.\\n\\nTherefore, such sets **do exist**.\\n\\nBut wait: when we add a new $b$, we add $k$ new elements, and we need to ensure that among these $k$ new ones, they are pairwise coprime, which we did, and each is coprime to all previous, which we did.\\n\\nAnd no future element will share a common factor with this one, because when we add future elements, we will ensure they are coprime to all current ones, including these.\\n\\nSo the pairwise coprimality is maintained.\\n\\nMoreover, since we go through all $(m,n)$ with $\\\\gcd(m,n)=1$, we eventually cover all required residue classes.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is **yes**.\\n\\nBut is there a problem?\\n\\nOne issue: when we add $a_i + b$, it might accidentally satisfy a future congruence, but that's ok, we just need existence.\\n\\nAlso, we might satisfy multiple $(m,n)$ at once, but we can still enumerate and cover all.\\n\\nSo it seems possible.\\n\\nBut earlier I thought the sparsity might conflict, but the constructive proof shows it's possible.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer to Problem 2 is **yes**.\\n\\nBut let me double-check.\\n\\nIn the construction, when we add $b$, we add $k$ elements. We need to make sure that for each of them, they are coprime to all others.\\n\\nWe ensured:\\n\\n- New vs old: yes, by avoiding prime factors\\n- New vs new: yes, by making $a_j + b$ coprime to differences\\n\\nAnd old vs old: already satisfied by induction.\\n\\nSo yes.\\n\\nAnd the density condition is met by construction.\\n\\nSo such sets exist.\\n\\nThus:\\n\\nProblem 1: $k = 2$\\n\\nProblem 2: yes\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"yes\"\n}",
