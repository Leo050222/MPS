  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-part problem. Let's break it down and solve each part step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 1: Understanding the Rock Game**\n\nAlice starts with 2015 rocks. At each round, if there are $ N $ rocks, she removes $ k $ where $ 1 \\leq k \\leq N $, each with equal probability $ \\frac{1}{N} $. The process continues until the pile is empty.\n\nLet $ p $ be the probability that **after each round**, the number of rocks left is a multiple of 5.\n\nThat is, after every removal (until zero), the remaining count is divisible by 5.\n\nWe need to compute this probability $ p $, and it's said that $ p $ can be written in the form:\n\n$$\np = 5^a \\cdot 31^b \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}\n$$\n\nwhere $ c $ and $ d $ are relatively prime to $ 5 \\cdot 31 = 155 $.\n\nThen, instead of computing $ a + b $, we are told to find:\n\n> $ m = b + 2 $\n\nand then **find all roots (real or complex)** of the system:\n\n$$\nx + y + z = m \\\\\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = m \\\\\nx^m + y^m + z^m = m\n$$\n\nOur goal is to solve this system and list all roots.\n\nBut first, we must determine $ m = b + 2 $, so we need to understand what $ b $ is — the exponent of 31 in the expression for $ p $.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Probability $ p $**\n\nWe are to compute the probability that **after every move**, the number of rocks remaining is divisible by 5.\n\nLet’s denote the sequence of rock counts as:\n\n$$\n2015 = N_0 > N_1 > N_2 > \\cdots > N_k = 0\n$$\n\nWe want $ N_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} $ for all $ i $.\n\nNote: After each move, the number of rocks **left** must be divisible by 5. So:\n\n- Start: 2015 rocks → 2015 mod 5 = 0 → OK.\n- She removes $ k $, so new pile has $ 2015 - k $\n- We require $ 2015 - k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} $ ⇒ $ k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} $\n- But $ k \\in [1, 2015] $, and she chooses uniformly among all such $ k $\n\nSo at each step, from a pile of size $ N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} $, she must remove a multiple of 5, so that the remainder is also divisible by 5.\n\nShe continues until 0.\n\nThus, the only allowed moves are those that reduce the pile from one multiple of 5 to another.\n\nSo effectively, the game becomes a Markov chain on multiples of 5: starting at 2015, then 2010, 2005, ..., 5, 0.\n\nAt each state $ N = 5n $, she must choose $ k $ divisible by 5, with $ 1 \\leq k \\leq N $, but $ k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} $\n\nNumber of valid $ k $: $ k = 5, 10, ..., 5n $ ⇒ $ n $ choices\n\nTotal possible $ k $: $ N = 5n $ ⇒ $ 5n $ choices\n\nSo probability of choosing a valid $ k $ at state $ 5n $ is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{n}{5n} = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$\n\nWait! Is that right?\n\nNo: Number of $ k \\in [1, 5n] $ divisible by 5 is $ n $: $ 5, 10, ..., 5n $\n\nTotal choices: $ 5n $\n\nSo probability of valid move at $ 5n $ is $ \\frac{n}{5n} = \\frac{1}{5} $\n\nBut wait — is that constant? Yes!\n\nAt each stage $ N = 5n $, the chance of removing a multiple of 5 is $ \\frac{1}{5} $\n\nBut note: we require **all** steps to satisfy this condition. So the total probability $ p $ is the product of these probabilities over all steps from 2015 down to 5.\n\nHow many such steps?\n\nWe go from 2015 → 2010 → ... → 5 → 0\n\nEach step reduces by a multiple of 5, but not necessarily exactly 5 — could be more.\n\nHowever, the key point is: at each current size $ N = 5n $, regardless of how we got there, the probability to make a move that keeps the remainder divisible by 5 is $ \\frac{1}{5} $, **but only if we are conditioning on continuing the path**.\n\nBut actually, the total probability $ p $ is the probability that **every move** results in a multiple of 5 remaining.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying: at each state $ 5n $, Alice chooses $ k $ divisible by 5.\n\nBut the choice is uniform over $ 1 \\leq k \\leq 5n $, so the probability to pick $ k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} $ is $ \\frac{1}{5} $, as above.\n\nBut here's the catch: once she picks such a $ k $, the next state is $ 5n - k $, which is still divisible by 5, say $ 5m $, and then again the probability to continue correctly is $ \\frac{1}{5} $, etc.\n\nBut is the number of steps fixed?\n\nNo — because she could jump from 2015 directly to 0 by removing 2015 (which is divisible by 5), so only one step.\n\nOr she could go 2015 → 2010 → 2005 → ... → 0, taking 403 steps.\n\nSo the number of transitions is **not fixed**.\n\nTherefore, the total probability $ p $ is not simply $ (1/5)^k $ for fixed $ k $.\n\nInstead, we must define $ f(n) $ as the probability that, starting from $ 5n $, all subsequent remainders are multiples of 5 (i.e., all moves remove multiples of 5).\n\nWe want $ f(403) $, since $ 2015 = 5 \\times 403 $\n\nNow, define $ f(n) $: probability that starting from $ 5n $, every future remainder is divisible by 5.\n\nBase case: $ f(0) = 1 $ (no moves, vacuously true)\n\nFor $ n \\geq 1 $:\n\nFrom $ 5n $, Alice chooses $ k \\in [1, 5n] $ uniformly.\n\nTo satisfy the condition, she must choose $ k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} $, i.e., $ k = 5j $ for $ j = 1, 2, ..., n $\n\nThere are $ n $ such values.\n\nGiven that she chooses such a $ k = 5j $, the next state is $ 5n - 5j = 5(n-j) $, and then the process must succeed from there.\n\nBut: the probability is not just summing over $ j $, because the choice is uniform over all $ k \\in [1,5n] $, not just multiples of 5.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nf(n) = \\sum_{\\substack{k=1 \\\\ 5|k}}^{5n} \\frac{1}{5n} \\cdot f(n - k/5)\n$$\n\nSince $ k = 5j $, $ j = 1 $ to $ n $, so:\n\n$$\nf(n) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{5n} \\cdot f(n - j) = \\frac{1}{5n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} f(n - j) = \\frac{1}{5n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(i)\n$$\n\nWhere we set $ i = n - j $\n\nSo recurrence:\n\n$$\nf(n) = \\frac{1}{5n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(i), \\quad f(0) = 1\n$$\n\nThis is a well-known type of recurrence.\n\nLet $ S(n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} f(i) $\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nf(n) = \\frac{1}{5n} (S(n-1)) \\\\\nS(n) = S(n-1) + f(n) = S(n-1) + \\frac{1}{5n} S(n-1) = S(n-1) \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{5n}\\right)\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nS(n) = S(n-1) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{5n + 1}{5n} \\right)\n$$\n\nWith $ S(0) = f(0) = 1 $\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\nS(n) = \\prod_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{5k + 1}{5k} = \\prod_{k=1}^{n} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{5k}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\nS(n) = \\prod_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{5k + 1}{5k}\n$$\n\nThen,\n\n$$\nf(n) = \\frac{1}{5n} S(n-1) = \\frac{1}{5n} \\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{5k + 1}{5k}\n$$\n\nWe want $ f(403) $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nf(403) = \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 403} \\prod_{k=1}^{402} \\frac{5k + 1}{5k}\n$$\n\nNow simplify this expression.\n\nFirst, $ 5 \\cdot 403 = 2015 $, so:\n\n$$\nf(403) = \\frac{1}{2015} \\prod_{k=1}^{402} \\frac{5k + 1}{5k}\n$$\n\nNow write the product:\n\n$$\n\\prod_{k=1}^{402} \\frac{5k + 1}{5k} = \\prod_{k=1}^{402} \\frac{5k + 1}{5k} = \\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^{402} (5k + 1)}{\\prod_{k=1}^{402} (5k)} = \\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^{402} (5k + 1)}{5^{402} \\prod_{k=1}^{402} k} = \\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^{402} (5k + 1)}{5^{402} \\cdot 402!}\n$$\n\nNow numerator: $ \\prod_{k=1}^{402} (5k + 1) = 6 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 16 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot (5 \\cdot 402 + 1) = 6 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 16 \\cdots 2011 $\n\nNote: This is an arithmetic sequence: first term 6, last term 2011, difference 5.\n\nNumber of terms: $ \\frac{2011 - 6}{5} + 1 = \\frac{2005}{5} + 1 = 401 + 1 = 402 $, correct.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n$$\n\\prod_{j=1}^{402} (5j + 1)\n$$\n\nNow, back to $ f(403) $:\n\n$$\nf(403) = \\frac{1}{2015} \\cdot \\frac{\\prod_{j=1}^{402} (5j + 1)}{5^{402} \\cdot 402!}\n$$\n\nBut $ 2015 = 5 \\cdot 403 $, so:\n\n$$\nf(403) = \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 403} \\cdot \\frac{\\prod_{j=1}^{402} (5j + 1)}{5^{402} \\cdot 402!} = \\frac{\\prod_{j=1}^{402} (5j + 1)}{5^{403} \\cdot 403 \\cdot 402!} = \\frac{\\prod_{j=1}^{402} (5j + 1)}{5^{403} \\cdot 403!}\n$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the prime factorization of this expression.\n\nWe are told that $ p = f(403) $ can be written as:\n\n$$\np = 5^a \\cdot 31^b \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}\n$$\n\nwith $ \\gcd(c, 155) = \\gcd(d, 155) = 1 $, i.e., $ c,d $ coprime to 5 and 31.\n\nWe need to find the exponent $ b $ of 31 in $ p $, then compute $ m = b + 2 $, and solve the system.\n\nSo our task reduces to computing the exponent of 31 in $ f(403) $, i.e., in:\n\n$$\nf(403) = \\frac{\\prod_{j=1}^{402} (5j + 1)}{5^{403} \\cdot 403!}\n$$\n\nLet’s compute the exponent of 31 in numerator and denominator.\n\nLet $ v_{31}(x) $ be the exponent of 31 in prime factorization of $ x $.\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nv_{31}(f(403)) = v_{31}\\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{402} (5j + 1) \\right) - v_{31}(5^{403}) - v_{31}(403!)\n$$\n\nBut $ v_{31}(5^{403}) = 0 $, since 5 ≠ 31.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nv_{31}(f(403)) = \\sum_{j=1}^{402} v_{31}(5j + 1) - v_{31}(403!)\n$$\n\nNow compute each term.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 1: Compute $ v_{31}(403!) $**\n\nBy Legendre's formula:\n\n$$\nv_{31}(403!) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{403}{31} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{403}{31^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n$$\n\n$ 31^1 = 31 $, $ 31^2 = 961 > 403 $, so only first term.\n\n$ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{403}{31} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 13.0 \\right\\rfloor $? Wait:\n\n$ 31 \\times 13 = 403 $? Check: $ 30 \\times 13 = 390 $, $ 1 \\times 13 = 13 $, total 403 → yes! $ 31 \\times 13 = 403 $\n\nSo $ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{403}{31} \\right\\rfloor = 13 $\n\nHigher powers: $ 31^2 = 961 > 403 $, so stop.\n\nThus:\n\n$$\nv_{31}(403!) = 13\n$$\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Count $ v_{31}(5j + 1) $ for $ j = 1 $ to $ 402 $**\n\nWe need to count how many times 31 divides the numbers $ 5j + 1 $ for $ j = 1 $ to $ 402 $.\n\nThat is, for how many $ j \\in [1,402] $, $ 5j + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{31} $, and higher powers.\n\nFirst, solve:\n\n$$\n5j + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{31} \\Rightarrow 5j \\equiv -1 \\pmod{31} \\Rightarrow 5j \\equiv 30 \\pmod{31}\n\\Rightarrow j \\equiv 6 \\pmod{31}\n$$\n\nBecause multiply both sides by inverse of 5 mod 31.\n\nInverse of 5 mod 31: find $ x $ such that $ 5x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} $\n\nTry: $ 5 \\cdot 25 = 125 \\equiv 125 - 4 \\cdot 31 = 125 - 124 = 1 $ → yes, inverse is 25.\n\nSo $ j \\equiv 30 \\cdot 25 \\pmod{31} = 750 \\mod 31 $\n\nCompute $ 750 \\div 31 $: $ 31 \\cdot 24 = 744 $, so $ 750 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{31} $\n\nSo $ j \\equiv 6 \\pmod{31} $\n\nSo solutions: $ j = 6, 37, 68, 99, 130, 161, 192, 223, 254, 285, 316, 347, 378, 409, ... $\n\nBut $ j \\leq 402 $, so up to $ j = 378 + 31 = 409 > 402 $, so stop at 378.\n\nSequence: $ j = 6 + 31k $, $ k = 0 $ to ?\n\n$ j \\leq 402 $: $ 6 + 31k \\leq 402 \\Rightarrow 31k \\leq 396 \\Rightarrow k \\leq 12.77 $, so $ k = 0 $ to $ 12 $\n\n→ $ k = 0,1,...,12 $: 13 values\n\nSo there are 13 values of $ j $ where $ 31 \\mid (5j+1) $\n\nNow check if any $ 31^2 = 961 $ divides $ 5j+1 $\n\nWe need $ 5j + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{961} $\n\nThen $ 5j \\equiv -1 \\pmod{961} \\Rightarrow j \\equiv (-1) \\cdot 5^{-1} \\pmod{961} $\n\nBut $ 5j + 1 \\geq 5 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 6 $, maximum $ 5 \\cdot 402 + 1 = 2011 $\n\n$ 31^2 = 961 $, $ 31^3 = 29791 > 2011 $, so only need to check divisibility by 961.\n\nIs there any $ j \\in [1,402] $ such that $ 5j + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{961} $?\n\nThen $ 5j \\equiv -1 \\pmod{961} \\Rightarrow j \\equiv -5^{-1} \\pmod{961} $\n\nFind inverse of 5 mod 961.\n\nSince $ \\gcd(5,961)=1 $, it exists.\n\nWe can compute $ 5 \\cdot x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{961} $\n\nUse extended Euclidean algorithm, or note that $ 5 \\cdot 769 = ? $\n\nAlternatively, since we only care whether $ 5j + 1 = 961 $ or $ 2 \\cdot 961 = 1922 $\n\nCheck:\n\n- $ 5j + 1 = 961 \\Rightarrow 5j = 960 \\Rightarrow j = 192 $\n- $ 5j + 1 = 1922 \\Rightarrow 5j = 1921 \\Rightarrow j = 384.2 $, not integer\n- Next: $ 3 \\cdot 961 = 2883 > 2011 $, too big\n\nSo only possible is $ 5j + 1 = 961 \\Rightarrow j = 192 $\n\nCheck: $ j = 192 \\in [1,402] $? Yes.\n\nNow verify: $ 5 \\cdot 192 + 1 = 960 + 1 = 961 = 31^2 $\n\nYes!\n\nSo when $ j = 192 $, $ 5j + 1 = 961 = 31^2 $, so $ v_{31}(5j+1) = 2 $\n\nFor other $ j \\equiv 6 \\pmod{31} $, $ v_{31}(5j+1) = 1 $, unless they are divisible by higher powers, but 31^3 too big.\n\nSo total:\n\n- 13 values of $ j $ where $ 31 \\mid (5j+1) $\n- Among them, $ j = 192 $ gives $ v_{31} = 2 $\n- Others give $ v_{31} = 1 $\n\nSo total exponent in numerator:\n\n$$\n\\sum v_{31}(5j+1) = 12 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 2 = 14\n$$\n\nNow subtract $ v_{31}(403!) = 13 $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nv_{31}(f(403)) = 14 - 13 = 1\n$$\n\nThus, $ b = 1 $\n\nThen $ m = b + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 $\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: Solve the System**\n\nNow solve the system:\n\n$$\nx + y + z = 3 \\quad (1) \\\\\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3 \\quad (2) \\\\\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 \\quad (3)\n$$\n\nWe need to find all roots (real or complex) satisfying this.\n\nUse symmetric identities.\n\nFrom (1): $ s_1 = x+y+z = 3 $\n\nFrom (2): $ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3 $\n\nBut $ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n3 = 3^2 - 2s_2 \\Rightarrow 3 = 9 - 2s_2 \\Rightarrow 2s_2 = 6 \\Rightarrow s_2 = 3\n$$\n\nWhere $ s_2 = xy + yz + zx $\n\nNow use identity for sum of cubes:\n\n$$\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x+y+z)^3 - 3(x+y+z)(xy+yz+zx) + 3xyz\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n3 = 3^3 - 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 + 3xyz = 27 - 27 + 3xyz = 0 + 3xyz \\Rightarrow 3xyz = 3 \\Rightarrow xyz = 1\n$$\n\nSo elementary symmetric sums:\n\n- $ s_1 = 3 $\n- $ s_2 = 3 $\n- $ s_3 = xyz = 1 $\n\nSo $ x,y,z $ are roots of the cubic:\n\n$$\nt^3 - s_1 t^2 + s_2 t - s_3 = 0 \\Rightarrow t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t - 1 = 0\n$$\n\nFactor:\n\n$$\nt^3 - 3t^2 + 3t - 1 = (t - 1)^3\n$$\n\nBecause $ (t-1)^3 = t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t - 1 $\n\nSo triple root: $ t = 1 $\n\nThus, the only solution (up to permutation) is $ x = y = z = 1 $\n\nSo the roots are $ x = 1, y = 1, z = 1 $\n\nBut the question says: \"Determine all the roots, real or complex, of the system\"\n\nIt means: find all triples $ (x,y,z) $ that satisfy the equations.\n\nSince the variables are symmetric, and the polynomial has a triple root, the only solution is $ (1,1,1) $\n\nAre there others? No, because the elementary symmetric sums fix the multiset of roots.\n\nSo the only solution is $ x = y = z = 1 $\n\nThus, the roots are $ x = 1, y = 1, z = 1 $\n\nBut the problem says \"determine all the roots\", probably meaning list the values.\n\nBut since it's a system, the solution is the triple $ (1,1,1) $\n\nBut perhaps they want the values of $ x, y, z $, which are all 1.\n\nBut to be precise, the only solution is $ x = 1, y = 1, z = 1 $\n\nSo the roots are 1, 1, 1.\n\nBut maybe they want the set of values.\n\nBut in context, likely the answer is that the only solution is all ones.\n\nBut the final answer should be presented as per instruction.\n\nBut recall: we were to compute $ m = b + 2 = 3 $, then solve the system.\n\nAnd now we have done so.\n\nBut the final output should be the answer to the entire problem, which is: list all roots.\n\nBut how to present it?\n\nPossibly: the roots are $ x=1, y=1, z=1 $\n\nBut since it's symmetric, and only one solution up to ordering, but actually since all equal, only one triple.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine all the roots, real or complex\" — probably meaning list the values of $ x, y, z $ in the solution(s).\n\nBut there is only one solution: $ (1,1,1) $\n\nSo the roots are $ 1, 1, 1 $\n\nBut to match format, perhaps box the triple.\n\nBut the instruction says: provide only the answer in the JSON.\n\nLooking back: \"Determine all the roots... of the system\"\n\nSo likely, the answer is the set of solutions.\n\nBut since it's three variables, and one solution, we can say $ x = y = z = 1 $\n\nBut for the JSON, we need a string.\n\nPerhaps: \"x = 1, y = 1, z = 1\"\n\nBut maybe they expect the values.\n\nAnother way: since the minimal polynomial is $ (t-1)^3 $, the roots are $ 1,1,1 $\n\nBut in context, I think the expected answer is the triple.\n\nBut to be safe, let's see.\n\nWait — the problem says: \"find $ m = b + 2 $\" — we did, $ m = 3 $\n\nThen solve the system with $ m = 3 $\n\nWe did.\n\nNow, the final answer should be the roots.\n\nBut in what form?\n\nPossibly: list the solutions.\n\nBut since it's symmetric and only one solution, we can state it.\n\nBut the answer field must contain only the answer.\n\nLooking at example: \"42\" or \"Monday\"\n\nSo perhaps we need to describe the solution.\n\nBut likely, since it's a math competition style, and the only solution is $ x=y=z=1 $, we can report that.\n\nBut to be precise, the roots are all 1.\n\nBut the system has three variables; the solution is $ (1,1,1) $\n\nBut the problem says \"roots\" plural, but might mean the values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want the multiset {1,1,1}\n\nBut I think safest is to say the only solution is $ x=1, y=1, z=1 $\n\nBut for the answer, put: \"1, 1, 1\"\n\nBut let's confirm if there are other solutions.\n\nSuppose two variables are equal, etc., but from symmetric sums, the elementary symmetric polynomials determine the roots uniquely up to permutation.\n\nThe cubic has only root 1 with multiplicity 3.\n\nSo the only solution (as a multiset) is three 1s.\n\nHence, the only solution is $ x=y=z=1 $\n\nSo the roots are 1, 1, and 1.\n\nThus, we can say the roots are $ 1, 1, 1 $\n\nFinal answer: list them.\n\nBut in the JSON.\n\nSo:\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"1, 1, 1\"\n}\n\nBut perhaps they want complex roots listed, but all are real.\n\nAlternatively, maybe write as a set, but since repeated, better as list.\n\nI think \"1, 1, 1\" is acceptable.\n\nTo be more precise: the solution is $ x=1, y=1, z=1 $\n\nBut the answer field should be concise.\n\nGiven the format, and examples, likely \"1, 1, 1\" is fine.\n\nAlternatively, if they want the value of something else, but no — the last sentence is to determine the roots.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"1, 1, 1\"\n}\n\nBut let me double-check everything.\n\n- $ b = 1 $: yes, exponent of 31 in $ f(403) $ is 1\n- $ m = 3 $: yes\n- System: $ x+y+z=3 $, $ x^2+y^2+z^2=3 $, $ x^3+y^3+z^3=3 $\n- Then $ (x+y+z)^2 = 9 = x^2+y^2+z^2 + 2(xy+yz+zx) = 3 + 2s_2 \\Rightarrow s_2=3 $\n- Sum of cubes: $ x^3+y^3+z^3 = s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 3s_3 = 27 - 3*3*3 + 3s_3 = 27-27+3s_3=3s_3=3 \\Rightarrow s_3=1 $\n- Polynomial: $ t^3 -3t^2 +3t -1=(t-1)^3 $\n- So roots: 1,1,1\n\nCorrect.\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"1, 1, 1\"\n}",
