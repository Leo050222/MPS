  "math_problem": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $N$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen. James writes down three integers. Alex picks some two of those integers, takes the average of them, and adds the result to the third integer. If the possible final results Alex could get are $(N - 86)$, 13, and 37, what are the three integers James originally chose?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given a multi-part problem, but ultimately we need to find three integers that James wrote down, based on some operations Alex performs and the results he can get: $ N - 86 $, 13, and 37.\n\nLet’s work through this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the final goal\n\nWe are told:\n\n- James writes down **three integers**.\n- Alex picks **two** of them, takes their **average**, and **adds** the result to the **third** integer.\n- The possible final results are: $ N - 86 $, 13, and 37.\n- We are to find the three integers.\n\nBut first, we must determine $ N $, defined as:  \n> \"the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen\"\n\nThis comes from the earlier probabilistic scenario involving antigens and students.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine $ N $\n\nThere are:\n- 8 different types of blood antigens.\n- 256 students.\n- Each student has a blood type corresponding to a **distinct subset** of the 8 antigens.\n\nSince there are $ 2^8 = 256 $ subsets of 8 antigens, and 256 students, each student corresponds to exactly one subset — i.e., all possible subsets are represented exactly once.\n\nNow, define $ N $: the number of students whose blood type **includes a given antigen**.\n\nFix one antigen, say antigen A. How many subsets of the 8 antigens include A?\n\n- Total subsets: $ 2^8 = 256 $\n- Subsets including A: For each of the other 7 antigens, they can be in or out → $ 2^7 = 128 $\n\nSo, for any fixed antigen, exactly 128 students have it.\n\nThus,\n$$\nN = 128\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute $ N - 86 $\n\n$$\nN - 86 = 128 - 86 = 42\n$$\n\nSo the three possible results Alex can get are: **42, 13, and 37**\n\nThese correspond to the three ways of choosing two numbers to average and adding to the third.\n\nLet the three integers be $ a, b, c $\n\nThen the three possible values Alex computes are:\n\n1. $ \\frac{a + b}{2} + c $\n2. $ \\frac{a + c}{2} + b $\n3. $ \\frac{b + c}{2} + a $\n\nAnd these expressions evaluate to 42, 13, and 37 in some order.\n\nLet us denote:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{a + b}{2} + c = \\frac{a + b + 2c}{2}\n$$\n$$\ny = \\frac{a + c}{2} + b = \\frac{a + 2b + c}{2}\n$$\n$$\nz = \\frac{b + c}{2} + a = \\frac{2a + b + c}{2}\n$$\n\nWe know $ x, y, z $ are 42, 13, 37 in some order.\n\nLet’s denote $ S = a + b + c $\n\nThen rewrite each expression in terms of $ S $:\n\n1. $ \\frac{a + b + 2c}{2} = \\frac{(a + b + c) + c}{2} = \\frac{S + c}{2} $\n2. $ \\frac{a + 2b + c}{2} = \\frac{S + b}{2} $\n3. $ \\frac{2a + b + c}{2} = \\frac{S + a}{2} $\n\nSo the three values are:\n- $ \\frac{S + a}{2} $\n- $ \\frac{S + b}{2} $\n- $ \\frac{S + c}{2} $\n\nAnd these are equal to 42, 13, 37 in some order.\n\nLet’s call these values:\n\n$$\n\\frac{S + a}{2} = p,\\quad \\frac{S + b}{2} = q,\\quad \\frac{S + c}{2} = r\n$$\n\nWhere $ \\{p, q, r\\} = \\{42, 13, 37\\} $\n\nAdd all three:\n\n$$\n\\frac{S + a}{2} + \\frac{S + b}{2} + \\frac{S + c}{2} = \\frac{3S + (a + b + c)}{2} = \\frac{3S + S}{2} = \\frac{4S}{2} = 2S\n$$\n\nSum of the three results: $ 42 + 13 + 37 = 92 $\n\nSo:\n$$\n2S = 92 \\Rightarrow S = 46\n$$\n\nNow, recall:\n$$\n\\frac{S + a}{2} = \\text{one of } 42, 13, 37\n$$\n\nTry each:\n\nSuppose $ \\frac{46 + a}{2} = 42 \\Rightarrow 46 + a = 84 \\Rightarrow a = 38 $\n\n$ \\frac{46 + a}{2} = 37 \\Rightarrow 46 + a = 74 \\Rightarrow a = 28 $\n\n$ \\frac{46 + a}{2} = 13 \\Rightarrow 46 + a = 26 \\Rightarrow a = -20 $\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the three values among $ \\frac{S + a}{2}, \\frac{S + b}{2}, \\frac{S + c}{2} $ are 42, 37, 13\n\nSo the individual variables are:\n\n- If $ \\frac{S + x}{2} = 42 \\Rightarrow x = 84 - 46 = 38 $\n- If $ \\frac{S + x}{2} = 37 \\Rightarrow x = 74 - 46 = 28 $\n- If $ \\frac{S + x}{2} = 13 \\Rightarrow x = 26 - 46 = -20 $\n\nWait: $ \\frac{S + x}{2} = v \\Rightarrow x = 2v - S $\n\nSo:\n\n- $ 2 \\cdot 42 - 46 = 84 - 46 = 38 $\n- $ 2 \\cdot 37 - 46 = 74 - 46 = 28 $\n- $ 2 \\cdot 13 - 46 = 26 - 46 = -20 $\n\nSo the three integers are: $ 38, 28, -20 $\n\nCheck sum: $ 38 + 28 - 20 = 46 $ → correct.\n\nNow verify that the three expressions give the right values.\n\nLet $ a = 38, b = 28, c = -20 $\n\nCompute:\n\n1. $ \\frac{a + b}{2} + c = \\frac{66}{2} + (-20) = 33 - 20 = 13 $\n2. $ \\frac{a + c}{2} + b = \\frac{18}{2} + 28 = 9 + 28 = 37 $\n3. $ \\frac{b + c}{2} + a = \\frac{8}{2} + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42 $\n\nPerfect! So the results are 13, 37, 42 → matches.\n\nSo the three integers are $ 38, 28, -20 $\n\nOrder doesn’t matter since James just wrote down three integers.\n\nAnswer: $ \\boxed{-20, 28, 38} $ (sorted)\n\nBut we should present them as is — but likely in sorted order or as found.\n\nThe question asks: **what are the three integers James originally chose?**\n\nThey are: -20, 28, 38\n\nWe can write them in increasing order.\n\n---\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"-20, 28, 38\"\n}",
