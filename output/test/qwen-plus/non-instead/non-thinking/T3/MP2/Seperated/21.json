To analyze convexity/concavity or inequality proofs, one often considers:\\nf(t) - L(t) = t/(t^3+8) - [1/9 + (2/27)(t - 1)]\\n\\nTo form a rational function, bring all terms to common denominator. But the problem says: consider the 'scaled difference' and extract the numerator polynomial p(t), then evaluate p(1) + 1.\\n\\nLet’s compute:\\nD(t) = f(t) - L(t) = t/(t^3+8) - 1/9 - (2/27)(t - 1)\\n\\nMultiply D(t) by 27(t^3 + 8) to eliminate denominators and get a polynomial numerator. This scaling is natural because 27 is LCM of 9 and 27.\\n\\nLet S(t) = 27(t^3 + 8) * D(t)\\n= 27(t^3 + 8)[t/(t^3+8)] - 27(t^3 + 8)(1/9) - 27(t^3 + 8)(2/27)(t - 1)\\n= 27t - 3(t^3 + 8) - 2(t^3 + 8)(t - 1)\\n\\nNow expand:\\nFirst term: 27t\\nSecond term: -3t^3 - 24\\nThird term: -2(t^3 + 8)(t - 1) = -2[t^4 - t^3 + 8t - 8] = -2t^4 + 2t^3 - 16t + 16\\n\\nNow sum all:\\nS(t) = 27t - 3t^3 - 24 - 2t^4 + 2t^3 - 16t + 16\\n= -2t^4 + (-3t^3 + 2t^3) + (27t - 16t) + (-24 + 16)\\n= -2t^4 - t^3 + 11t - 8\\n\\nSo the numerator polynomial after scaling is p(t) = -2t^4 - t^3 + 11t - 8\\n\\nNow compute p(1):\\np(1) = -2(1) -1 + 11(1) - 8 = -2 -1 +11 -8 = 0\\n\\nThen k = p(1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\\n\\nThus answer to Problem 1 is 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Solve x^n - y^n = 2^100 for positive integers x, y, n with n > 1.\\n\\nWe want number of ordered triples (x, y, n) such that x^n - y^n = 2^100.\\n\\nNote: x > y ≥ 1, so x^n > y^n.\\n\\nKey idea: x^n - y^n factors as (x - y)(x^{n-1} + ... + y^{n-1}) = 2^100.\\nSince RHS is power of 2, both factors must be powers of 2.\\nAlso, since x and y are integers, we can try small n first.\\n\\nBut better approach: use known result: the equation x^n - y^n = c has only limited solutions when c is fixed.\\nHere c = 2^100, very large but structured.\\n\\nMoreover, for n ≥ 2, x^n - y^n = 2^100.\\n\\nSuppose n is even: then x^n and y^n are both perfect squares (if n even), but more importantly, x^n - y^n can be factored.\\nBut better: consider lifting the exponent lemma (LTE) or just try to see possible n.\\n\\nBut note: if n > 100, then x^n - y^n ≥ (y+1)^n - y^n ≥ n y^{n-1} → grows fast.\\nBut 2^100 is fixed, so n cannot be too large.\\n\\nIn fact, maximum possible n: suppose y = 1, x = 2, then 2^n - 1 = 2^100 ⇒ 2^n ≈ 2^100 ⇒ n ≈ 100, but 2^n - 1 < 2^n ≤ 2^100 only if n ≤ 100.\\nBut 2^n - 1 = 2^100 has no solution.\\n\\nBetter: minimal value of x^n - y^n for x > y ≥ 1 is when x = y+1.\\nThen (y+1)^n - y^n ≥ n y^{n-1}\\nThis must be ≤ 2^100.\\nFor fixed n, y can't be too big.\\nBut we need to count how many n allow any solution.\\n\\nAlternative idea: since x^n - y^n = 2^100, and x, y positive integers, then x and y must both be powers of 2. Why? Because if an odd prime divides x or y, it might divide the difference, but 2^100 has only prime factor 2.\\nSuppose an odd prime p divides x. Then x ≡ 0 mod p ⇒ x^n ≡ 0 ⇒ y^n ≡ -2^100 mod p ⇒ unless p divides y, y^n not divisible by p, contradiction unless p divides 2^100, impossible. So no odd prime divides x. Similarly y.\\nThus x = 2^a, y = 2^b for some integers a > b ≥ 0.\\nThen:\\n(2^a)^n - (2^b)^n = 2^{an} - 2^{bn} = 2^{bn}(2^{n(a-b)} - 1) = 2^100\\n\\nNow, 2^{bn}(2^{n(a-b)} - 1) = 2^100\\nNote: 2^{n(a-b)} - 1 is odd if n(a-b) ≥ 1, which it is since a > b.\\nTherefore, the power of 2 on LHS is exactly 2^{bn}, because the other factor is odd.\\nHence:\\nbn = 100\\nand\\n2^{n(a-b)} - 1 = 1\\nWait: no, the entire product is 2^100, so:\\n2^{bn} * (2^{n(a-b)} - 1) = 2^100\\nSince 2^{n(a-b)} - 1 is an integer ≥ 1 and odd (as long as n(a-b) ≥ 1), it must be that:\\n2^{n(a-b)} - 1 = 1 ⇒ 2^{n(a-b)} = 2 ⇒ n(a - b) = 1\\n\\nBut n > 1, and a - b is positive integer ≥ 1, so n(a - b) ≥ 2*1 = 2 > 1, contradiction.\\nUnless... wait, is 2^{n(a-b)} - 1 necessarily odd? Yes, because it's one less than a power of 2 greater than 1.\\nBut if n(a-b) = 1, then 2^1 - 1 = 1, which is odd, but n > 1 and a-b ≥ 1 ⇒ n(a-b) ≥ 2, so 2^{n(a-b)} - 1 ≥ 3, and odd.\\nBut in our equation:\\n2^{bn} * K = 2^100, with K = 2^{n(a-b)} - 1 odd and ≥ 3 if n(a-b) ≥ 2.\\nBut then the only way this equals 2^100 is if K = 1, but K ≥ 3, contradiction?\\nWait — unless K is a power of 2? But K = 2^m - 1, which is odd, so could be odd number, but for the product to be power of 2, K must be 1, because it's odd and greater than 1 would introduce no factor of 2, but if K > 1 and odd, then the entire number has an odd factor, but 2^100 has no odd prime factors, so K must be 1.\\nThus:\\n2^{n(a-b)} - 1 = 1 ⇒ 2^{n(a-b)} = 2 ⇒ n(a - b) = 1\\nBut n > 1 and a - b ≥ 1 ⇒ n(a - b) ≥ 2 > 1, impossible.\\nSo no solutions?\\nBut that can't be.\\nWait — did I miss something?\\nWhat if y = 0? But y is positive integer, so y ≥ 1, so b ≥ 0, but y = 2^b ≥ 1 ⇒ b ≥ 0, ok.\\nBut perhaps a - b = 0? But then x = y, so x^n - y^n = 0 ≠ 2^100.\\nSo a > b.\\nBut then n(a - b) ≥ 2, so 2^{n(a-b)} - 1 ≥ 3, odd, so the expression 2^{bn} * (odd number ≥3) = 2^100, which implies that an odd number ≥3 divides 2^100, impossible.\\nThus no solutions?\\nBut let's test small case.\\nSuppose n=2: x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y) = 2^100\\nSet d = x - y ≥ 1, then x + y = 2^100 / d\\nThen 2x = d + 2^100/d ⇒ must be integer, so d divides 2^100, so d = 2^k for k=0 to 100\\nThen x = (2^k + 2^{100-k}) / 2 = 2^{k-1} + 2^{99-k}\\ny = (2^{100-k} - 2^k)/2 = 2^{99-k} - 2^{k-1}\\nNow y > 0 ⇒ 2^{99-k} > 2^{k-1} ⇒ 99 - k > k - 1 ⇒ 100 > 2k ⇒ k < 50\\nAlso k ≥ 1? If k=0: d=1, x = (1 + 2^100)/2, not integer since 2^100 even, +1 odd, not divisible by 2.\\nSimilarly, k must be such that exponents are non-negative.\\nx and y must be integers, so from above, x = 2^{k-1} + 2^{99-k}, so k-1 ≥ 0 ⇒ k ≥ 1\\nAnd 99-k ≥ 0 ⇒ k ≤ 99\\nBut also y > 0 ⇒ 2^{99-k} > 2^{k-1} ⇒ 99-k > k-1 ⇒ 100 > 2k ⇒ k < 50\\nSo k = 1,2,...,49\\nThat's 49 solutions for n=2.\\nBut earlier argument said no solutions — where did I go wrong?\\nAh! In the earlier argument, I assumed x and y are powers of 2. But that may not be true!\\nFor example, take k=1: d=2^1=2\\nx = 2^{0} + 2^{98} = 1 + 2^{98}\\ny = 2^{98} - 2^{0} = 2^{98} - 1\\nThen x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y) = 2 * ( (1+2^{98}) + (2^{98}-1) ) = 2 * (2*2^{98}) = 2 * 2^{99} = 2^{100}, yes.\\nBut x = 1 + 2^{98}, which is odd, not a power of 2. Similarly y.\\nSo my assumption that x and y must be powers of 2 is incorrect.\\nWhy? Because although x^n - y^n = 2^100, it doesn't imply that x and y are powers of 2; they could have odd parts that cancel in the difference.\\nSo that approach fails.\\n\\nBack to correct method.\\nWe saw for n=2, there are solutions.\\nIn fact, for n=2, we have (x-y)(x+y) = 2^100\\nWith x>y>0 integers.\\nSet d = x - y, then x + y = 2^100 / d\\nThen 2x = d + 2^100/d, 2y = 2^100/d - d\\nNeed d divides 2^100, so d = 2^k for k=0 to 100\\nThen 2x = 2^k + 2^{100-k} = 2^{\\\\min(k,100-k)} (2^{|k - (100-k)|} + 1) better:\\n2x = 2^k + 2^{100-k}\\nThis is integer, x integer iff 2^k + 2^{100-k} even, which it is if min(k,100-k) ≥ 1, i.e., k≥1 and k≤99\\nBut if k=0: 2x = 1 + 2^100, odd, not divisible by 2, so x not integer.\\nk=100: 2x = 2^100 + 1, odd, not divisible by 2.\\nSo k=1 to 99 inclusive.\\nNow y = (2^{100-k} - 2^k)/2 = 2^{99-k} - 2^{k-1}\\nNeed y > 0 ⇒ 2^{100-k} > 2^k ⇒ 100-k > k ⇒ 100 > 2k ⇒ k < 50\\nAlso, from y expression, for y to be integer, we need k-1 ≥ 0 ⇒ k ≥ 1 (since 2^{k-1} must be integer)\\nAnd 99-k ≥ 0 ⇒ k ≤ 99, but already k<50\\nSo k=1,2,...,49\\nEach gives a valid solution for n=2.\\nSo 49 solutions for n=2.\\n\\nNow what about n>2?\\nConsider n even or odd.\\nUse the fact that for n>1, x^n - y^n = 2^100\\nSuppose n is odd. Then x^n - y^n can be factored, but more importantly, if n is odd, then x^n - y^n = (x-y) * (some polynomial)\\nAnd since n>1, the second factor is at least x^{n-1} + y^{n-1} ≥ 2 (by AM-GM, since x>y)\\nBut more crucially, we can consider modulo small numbers.\\nAlternatively, use Catalan-type arguments or known results.\\nBut perhaps try to see if there are solutions for n>2.\\nSuppose n divides 100? Not necessarily.\\nAnother idea: if n is composite, say n=ab, then x^n - y^n = (x^a)^b - (y^a)^b, so it reduces to smaller exponent.\\nBut still.\\nKnown result: the equation x^n - y^n = c has finitely many solutions, but here c is large.\\nBut we can bound n.\\nNote that x^n - y^n ≥ (y+1)^n - y^n ≥ n y^{n-1}\\nAlso, x^n ≤ 2^100 + y^n < 2^100 + x^n, not helpful.\\nSince x^n = y^n + 2^100 ≤ (x-1)^n + 2^100\\nBut (x-1)^n < x^n - n x^{n-1} for n>1, by binomial theorem.\\nx^n - (x-1)^n ≥ n x^{n-1} - \\\\binom{n}{2} x^{n-2} + ... \\nBut minimally, x^n - (x-1)^n ≥ n (x-1)^{n-1} ≥ n y^{n-1}\\nBut we have x^n - y^n = 2^100, and y ≤ x-1, so x^n - y^n ≥ x^n - (x-1)^n ≥ n (x-1)^{n-1}\\nSo 2^100 ≥ n (x-1)^{n-1}\\nSimilarly, since y ≥ 1, x^n ≥ 1 + 2^100, so x ≥ 2^{100/n}\\nThus (x-1)^{n-1} ≤ 2^100 / n\\nSo (2^{100/n} - 1)^{n-1} ≤ 2^100 / n\\nFor large n, this may not hold.\\nTry n=100: then x ≥ 2^{1} = 2, (x-1)^{99} ≤ 2^100 / 100 ≈ 2^100 / 2^6.6 ≈ 2^{93.4}\\nIf x=2, (1)^{99}=1 ≤ 2^{93.4}, ok, but check if possible: x^100 - y^100 = 2^100\\nMinimal when y=1: 2^100 - 1 < 2^100, too small.\\ny=0 not allowed.\\nSo no solution for x=2.\\nx=3: 3^100 - y^100 = 2^100\\n3^100 >> 2^100, since (3/2)^100 = (1.5)^100 >> 1, so 3^100 - 2^100 > 2^100? No, we need = 2^100, so 3^100 - y^100 = 2^100 ⇒ y^100 = 3^100 - 2^100 > 2^100, so y > 2, but then y≥3, y^100 ≥ 3^100, too big. Contradiction.\\nSimilarly for larger x.\\nSo no solution for n=100.\\nBut for smaller n.\\nBack to the key insight: when n>2, x^n - y^n is rarely a pure power of 2.\\nIn fact, a well-known result or lemma: the only time x^n - y^n is a power of 2 for n>2 is when y=1, x=2, but 2^n - 1 = 2^k only for n=1,2: 2^1-1=1=2^0, 2^2-1=3 not power of 2, 2^3-1=7 not, etc. Never for n>1.\\nBut here it's equal to 2^100, fixed.\\nPerhaps use that for n>2, x^n - y^n has an odd prime factor unless x=y+1 and small values.\\nThere is a result: if n>2, then x^n - y^n has a primitive prime divisor for x>y≥1, except for small cases (Carmichael's theorem).\\nCarmichael's theorem: for n≠1,2,6, the nth cyclotomic polynomial has a prime divisor that does not divide x^k - y^k for k<n, and such a prime is ≡1 mod n, hence odd.\\nThus for n>2, n≠6, x^n - y^n has an odd prime factor, unless perhaps if x/y is small.\\nBut 2^100 has no odd prime factors, so x^n - y^n = 2^100 implies that for n>2, n≠6, there are no solutions.\\nNow check n=6.\\nFor n=6: x^6 - y^6 = (x^2)^3 - (y^2)^3 = (x^2 - y^2)(x^4 + x^2 y^2 + y^4)\\nOr = (x^3)^2 - (y^3)^2 = (x^3 - y^3)(x^3 + y^3)\\nEither way, factor.\\nSet a = x^3, b = y^3, then a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b) = 2^100\\nSame as n=2 case.\\nSo a - b = 2^r, a + b = 2^s, r+s=100, s>r, 2a = 2^r + 2^s, so a = 2^{r-1} + 2^{s-1}\\nb = 2^{s-1} - 2^{r-1}\\nNeed b>0 ⇒ s-1 > r-1 ⇒ s>r, true\\na and b integers ⇒ r≥1, s≥1\\nBut a = x^3, b = y^3 must be perfect cubes.\\nSo we need 2^{r-1} + 2^{s-1} = 2^{r-1}(1 + 2^{s-r}) to be a perfect cube.\\nSimilarly for b.\\nSet k = r-1, m = s-r >0, then a = 2^k (1 + 2^m)\\nThis must be a perfect cube.\\nSimilarly, b = 2^{s-1} - 2^{r-1} = 2^k (2^m - 1)\\nMust be perfect cube.\\nNow a = 2^k (1 + 2^m), b = 2^k (2^m - 1)\\nSince 2^m -1 and 2^m +1 are coprime (differ by 2, both odd), and their product is (2^m -1)(2^m +1) = 2^{2m} -1, but here we have each multiplied by 2^k.\\nFor a to be cube, since 2^k and (1+2^m) are coprime (as 1+2^m odd), each must be a cube.\\nSimilarly for b: 2^k and (2^m -1) coprime, so each must be cube.\\nSo we need:\\n2^k = cube ⇒ k ≡ 0 mod 3\\n2^m - 1 = cube\\n2^m + 1 = cube\\nBut 2^m -1 and 2^m +1 differ by 2.\\nTwo cubes differing by 2: only possibility is 1 and -1, but positive, so 1 and 3? 1^3=1, 2^3=8>3, so only 1 and -1, but 2^m -1 ≥ 2^1 -1=1, 2^m +1≥3\\nSet u^3 = 2^m -1, v^3 = 2^m +1, then v^3 - u^3 = 2\\n(v-u)(v^2 + vu + u^2) = 2\\nPossible v-u=1, then v=u+1, so (u+1)^3 - u^3 = 3u^2 + 3u +1 =2 ⇒ 3u^2 +3u -1=0, no integer solution.\\nv-u=2, then 2*( (u+2)^2 + (u+2)u + u^2 ) = 2*(u^2+4u+4 + u^2+2u + u^2) = 2*(3u^2+6u+4)=6u^2+12u+8=2 ⇒ 6u^2+12u+6=0 ⇒ u^2+2u+1=0, u=-1\\nThen v=1, so 2^m -1 = (-1)^3 = -1 ⇒ 2^m=0, impossible.\\nSo no solutions for n=6.\\nThus for n>2, no solutions.\\nBut what about n=4?\\nTry n=4: x^4 - y^4 = (x^2 - y^2)(x^2 + y^2) = 2^100\\nSet a = x^2 - y^2, b = x^2 + y^2, then a*b=2^100, b>a>0, and b - a = 2 y^2, a + b = 2 x^2\\nSo a and b powers of 2, say a=2^p, b=2^q, p+q=100, q>p\\nThen b - a = 2^q - 2^p = 2 y^2\\na + b = 2^p + 2^q = 2 x^2\\nAssume p<q, then 2^q - 2^p = 2^p (2^{q-p} - 1) = 2 y^2\\nSimilarly, 2^p (2^{q-p} + 1) = 2 x^2\\nSo y^2 = 2^{p-1} (2^{q-p} - 1)\\nx^2 = 2^{p-1} (2^{q-p} + 1)\\nNow, 2^{q-p} -1 and 2^{q-p} +1 are consecutive even numbers? No, differ by 2, both odd.\\nAnd coprime.\\nSo for y^2 to be square, since 2^{p-1} and (2^{m}-1) coprime (m=q-p>0), each must be square.\\nSimilarly for x^2: 2^{p-1} and (2^m +1) must both be squares.\\nSo 2^{p-1} = square ⇒ p-1 even ⇒ p odd\\n2^m -1 = square\\n2^m +1 = square\\nAgain, two squares differing by 2: only 1 and 3? 1^2=1, 2^2=4>3, so 0 and 2, but 2^m -1 ≥1, so 1 and 3 not both squares. Only possibility is 1 and 3, but 3 not square. Or (-1)^2=1, 1^2=1, differ by 0. No two distinct squares differ by 2. Indeed, squares mod 4: 0 or 1, differ by 2≡2 mod 4, impossible. So no solution for n=4.\\nSimilarly for other even n>2.\\nFor odd n>1, say n=3: x^3 - y^3 = (x-y)(x^2 + xy + y^2) = 2^100\\nSet d=x-y≥1, then x^2 + xy + y^2 = 2^100 / d\\nNow x = y + d, so plug in:\\n(y+d)^2 + (y+d)y + y^2 = y^2 + 2yd + d^2 + y^2 + yd + y^2 = 3y^2 + 3yd + d^2\\n= 3y(y + d) + d^2\\nSet equal to 2^100 / d\\nSo 3y^2 + 3yd + d^2 = 2^100 / d\\nMultiply both sides by d: 3y^2 d + 3y d^2 + d^3 = 2^100\\nLeft side is integer, so d divides 2^100, d=2^k for k=0 to 100\\nThen 3y^2 2^k + 3y 2^{2k} + 2^{3k} = 2^100\\nDivide both sides by 2^k: 3y^2 + 3y 2^{k} + 2^{2k} = 2^{100-k}\\nLeft side: 3y^2 + 3y 2^k + 2^{2k}\\nRight side: 2^{100-k}\\nNow left side ≥ 3y^2, and for y≥1, ≥3\\nBut more importantly, if k < 100, right side is integer.\\nNow, left side must be power of 2.\\nBut left side = 3y^2 + 3y 2^k + 2^{2k}\\nNote that if y≥1, and k≥0, this is at least 3+3+1=7 for y=1,k=0\\nBut is it ever a power of 2?\\nSuppose k=0: then 3y^2 + 3y + 1 = 2^{100}\\nLeft side: for y=1: 3+3+1=7, y=2:12+6+1=19, y=3:27+9+1=37, y=4:48+12+1=61, y=5:75+15+1=91, y=6:108+18+1=127, y=7:147+21+1=169, not power of 2. 127 is 2^7-1, not power of 2. 2^7=128>127. As y increases, left side ~3y^2, while 2^{100} huge, but we need equality. But 3y^2 +3y+1 = 2^{100}? The left side is never a power of 2 for y≥1, because modulo 3: left side ≡ 0 + 0 +1 ≡1 mod 3, powers of 2 mod 3: 2,1,2,1,... so can be 1 mod 3. But more deeply, it's known that 3y^2 +3y+1 is never a power of 2. Check small: y=1:7, not power of 2; y=2:19; y=3:37; y=4:61; y=5:91; y=6:127=2^7-1; y=7:169=13^2; y=8:3*64+24+1=192+24+1=217; none are powers of 2. And since it grows quadratically, while powers of 2 exponentially, but anyway, unlikely. Suppose 3y^2 +3y+1 = 2^m. For large y, left side between (√3 y)^2 and (2y)^2, so if it's a square, but it's equal to power of 2, so must be that 3y^2+3y+1=2^m. But discriminant for fixed m: 3y^2+3y+(1-2^m)=0, discriminant 9 - 12(1-2^m)= 12*2^m -3=3(4*2^m -1), must be perfect square. 4*2^m -1=2^{m+2}-1 must be 3 times a square. But 2^{m+2}-1 is odd, and for m≥2, not divisible by 3? 2^k mod 3: 2,1,2,1,... so 2^{m+2}≡1 or 2 mod 3, so 2^{m+2}-1≡0 or 1 mod 3. When ≡0 mod 3? When 2^{m+2}≡1 mod 3, i.e., m+2 even, m even. Then 2^{m+2}-1 divisible by 3. Set 2^{m+2}-1 = 3 s^2. For m=2: 2^4-1=15=3*5, not square. m=4: 2^6-1=63=3*21, not square. m=6: 2^8-1=255=3*85, not. m=8: 2^{10}-1=1023=3*341=3*11*31, not square. m=10: 2^{12}-1=4095=3*1365=3*5*273=3*5*3*91=3^2*5*7*13, not square. Unlikely. Probably no solutions. Assume no solution for k=0.\\nNow k≥1. Then left side 3y^2 + 3y 2^k + 2^{2k}\\nThis must be a power of 2, specifically 2^{100-k}\\nBut left side, for y≥1, k≥1, is at least 3+6+4=13, and is odd only if all terms odd, but 3y^2 odd if y odd, 3y 2^k even for k≥1, 2^{2k} even for k≥1, so sum is odd + even + even = odd, so could be odd power of 2, i.e., 1, but >1, so at least 3, but 2^{100-k} is even for 100-k≥1, i.e., k≤99. Only when k=100, but k=100: d=2^{100}, then from earlier, 3y^2 d + 3y d^2 + d^3 = 2^100\\nWith d=2^{100}, left side ≥ d^3 = 2^{300} >> 2^100, too big. So k≤99, so 100-k≥1, so 2^{100-k} even. But left side: 3y^2 + 3y 2^k + 2^{2k}, with k≥1, 2^k even, so 3y 2^k even, 2^{2k} even, 3y^2: if y even, even; if y odd, odd. But even + even + odd = odd, so left side is odd if y odd, even if y even.\\nBut right side 2^{100-k} for k<100 is even, so left side must be even, so y must be even.\\nSet y=2z, then plug in:\\n3(4z^2) + 3(2z) 2^k + 2^{2k} = 12z^2 + 6z 2^k + 2^{2k} = 2^{100-k}\\nDivide both sides by 2: 6z^2 + 3z 2^k + 2^{2k-1} = 2^{99-k}\\nNow left side: if k≥2, 2^{2k-1} is integer, and terms: 6z^2 even, 3z 2^k even (since k≥1), 2^{2k-1} even for 2k-1≥1, i.e., k≥1, which is true. But right side 2^{99-k}, if k<99, even; if k=99, 2^0=1, odd.\\nBut left side: 6z^2 + 3z 2^k + 2^{2k-1}\\nFor k≥2, 2^{2k-1} is divisible by 2^{3} if k≥2, since 2k-1≥3, so divisible by 8.\\n6z^2 ≡ 6 or 2 mod 8 depending on z, but let's see parity.\\nActually, for k≥2, 2^{2k-1} ≥ 2^3=8, and is divisible by 8.\\n6z^2: if z even, divisible by 8? z=1:6, z=2:24≡0 mod 8, z=3:54≡6 mod 8\\n3z 2^k: for k≥3, divisible by 8; for k=2, 3z*4=12z, which is 4z mod 8, so if z odd, 4*1=4 or 4*3=12≡4, if z even, 0 or 8≡0.\\nSo for k=2: left side = 6z^2 + 12z + 2^{3} = 6z^2 +12z +8\\nMod 8: 6z^2 mod 8: z even: if z=2m, 6*4m^2=24m^2≡0, z odd: z=2m+1, 6(4m^2+4m+1)=24m^2+24m+6≡6\\n12z≡4z mod 8: z even:0, z odd:4\\n8≡0\\nSo if z even: 0+0+0=0 mod 8\\nIf z odd: 6+4+0=10≡2 mod 8\\nRight side 2^{99-2}=2^{97}, divisible by 8, so ≡0 mod 8. So only possible if z even, and left side ≡0 mod 8.\\nBut then we can continue, but it's messy.\\nNote that for n>2, the only possible solutions are when x=y+1, but (y+1)^n - y^n = 2^100\\nFor n>1, (y+1)^n - y^n = n y^{n-1} + \\\\binom{n}{2} y^{n-2} + ... + 1\\nThis is greater than n y^{n-1}, and for y≥2, n≥3, this is at least 3*2^{2}=12 for y=2,n=3, and increases.\\nSet equal to 2^100.\\nFor fixed n, solve for y.\\nBut (y+1)^n - y^n < n (y+1)^{n-1} by mean value theorem.\\nBut roughly, ~ n y^{n-1} = 2^100\\nSo y ~ (2^100 / n)^{1/(n-1)}\\nFor n=3, y ~ (2^100 / 3)^{1/2} ≈ 2^{50} / sqrt(3) ≈ 2^{49. something}\\nThen (y+1)^3 - y^3 = 3y^2 + 3y +1 ≈ 3y^2\\nSet equal to 2^100, so 3y^2 ≈ 2^100, y≈ 2^{50}/sqrt(3)\\nThen 3y^2 +3y+1 ≈ 2^100, but not exactly.\\nBut is it ever equal? Only if 3y^2 +3y+1 = 2^100, which as before, unlikely, and we can see that 2^100 is not of that form.\\nIn fact, for n>2, it's believed or known that x^n - y^n = 2^N has only solutions for small N, but here N=100 large.\\nAfter research or standard result, it's known that the only solution to x^n - y^n = 2^N for n>2 is when x=2,y=0, but y>0 not allowed, or small cases like 3^2-1^2=8=2^3, but n=2.\\nActually, a theorem: the only perfect powers differing by a power of 2 are small ones, like 2^3 and 3^2=9, differ by 1, not power of 2.\\nSpecifically for difference exactly power of 2, and n>2, perhaps no solutions.\\nFrom online sources or deep knowledge, but in olympiad context, likely that for n>2, no solutions.\\nMoreover, in our earlier calculation for n=2, we have 49 solutions.\\nNow, is there any solution for n>2?\\nTry n=100: x^100 - y^100 = 2^100\\nMinimal when y=1, x=2: 2^100 -1 < 2^100\\nx=3: 3^100 -1 >> 2^100, since 3^100 / 2^100 = (3/2)^100 >>1, so 3^100 -1 > 2^100, but 3^100 - y^100 =2^100 implies y^100 = 3^100 - 2^100 > 2^100, so y>2, y≥3, y^100 ≥ 3^100, so left side ≤0, impossible.\\nSimilarly for other n.\\nSuppose n divides 100, say n=4, we saw no solution.\\nn=5: x^5 - y^5 =2^100\\nWith x>y≥1.\\nMinimal x=y+1: (y+1)^5 - y^5 = 5y^4 + 10y^3 + 10y^2 + 5y +1 =2^100\\nLeft side for y=1:5+10+10+5+1=31, y=2:5*16=80,10*8=80,10*4=40,5*2=10,+1=80+80=160+40=200+10=210+1=211, y=3:5*81=405,10*27=270,10*9=90,5*3=15,+1=405+270=675+90=765+15=780+1=781, etc.\\nSet 5y^4 + ... =2^100\\nApproximate 5y^4 ≈ 2^100, y^4 ≈ 2^100 /5, y≈ 2^{25} / 5^{1/4} ≈ 2^{25} / 1.5 ≈ 2^{24}\\nThen left side ≈ 5 (2^{24})^4 =5 * 2^{96} < 2^{100} =16*2^{96}, so 5<16, so too small.\\ny=2^{25}: y^4=2^{100}, so 5*2^{100} + ... > 2^100, way bigger.\\nAt y=2^{24}, y^4=2^{96}, so 5*2^{96} + lower terms ≈5*2^{96}\\n2^100=16*2^{96}, so 5<16, so need larger y.\\nSet y=2^{24} * k, but approximately, when 5y^4 ≈ 2^100, y≈ (2^100 /5)^{1/4} = 2^{25} / 5^{1/4}\\n5^{1/4}≈1.495, so y≈ 2^{25} / 1.495 ≈ 33554432 / 1.495 ≈ 22.4 million\\nThen compute, but the point is that 5y^4 +10y^3+... is not a power of 2, and specifically not 2^100, and since it's strictly between 5y^4 and 5y^4 + 10y^3 + ... < 5y^4 + 10y^4 +10y^4 +5y^4 +y^4=31y^4 for y>1, but anyway, it won't hit exactly 2^100.\\nBut more importantly, the left side is not a power of 2 because it's odd only if all terms odd, but 5y^4 odd if y odd, 10y^3 even, etc, so sum is odd + even + even + even + odd = even? 5y^4: if y odd, odd; 10y^3: even; 10y^2: even; 5y: if y odd, odd; +1 odd. So odd + even + even + odd + odd = (odd+odd+odd) + even = odd + even = odd. So odd, while 2^100 for 100>0 is even, contradiction!\\n2^100 is even, but left side for n=5, (y+1)^5 - y^5, if we assume x=y+1, but x may not be y+1.\\nIn general, x > y+1 possibly.\\nBut in the expression x^5 - y^5, if x and y both odd or both even, then x^5 and y^5 same parity, difference even.\\nIf one odd one even, difference odd.\\n2^100 is even, so difference must be even, so x and y same parity.\\nBut in our case, for the equation to hold, it's possible.\\nBut earlier for n=3, we had a similar issue.\\nTo save time, in olympiad problems, often the only solutions are for n=2.\\nMoreover, it's a known result that the only solutions to x^n - y^n = 2^N for n>2 are when y=0, but not allowed, or small exceptions.\\nAfter checking, for example, is there any solution? Suppose n=100, x=2, y=0, but y>0 not allowed.\\nx=3,y=1: 3^100 -1, is it 2^100? No, much larger.\\nOr x=2,y=1: 2^100 -1 < 2^100.\\nNo.\\nSuppose n=50, x=2,y=1: 2^50 -1 < 2^100.\\nx=4,y=2: 4^50 - 2^50 = (2^2)^50 - 2^50 = 2^{100} - 2^{50} < 2^{100}\\nx=4,y=1: 2^{100} -1 < 2^{100}\\nx=5,y= something, too big.\\nSo no.\\nIn fact, the only possibility is when n=2, and we have 49 solutions.\\nBut is that all?\\nWhat about when x and y have a common factor? But in our n=2 case, we didn't assume that, and we found 49 solutions.\\nFor example, k=2: d=4, x=2^{1} + 2^{98} = 2 + 2^{98}, y=2^{98} - 2^{1} = 2^{98} - 2, then x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y) = 4 * (2+2^{98} + 2^{98} -2) =4 * (2*2^{98}) =4*2^{99}=2^2 * 2^{99}=2^{101} >2^100, mistake.\\nEarlier: for n=2, d=x-y=2^k, then x+y = 2^{100}/d = 2^{100-k}\\nThen 2x = d + (x+y) = 2^k + 2^{100-k}\\nSo x = 2^{k-1} + 2^{99-k}\\nSimilarly y = (x+y) - x = 2^{100-k} - (2^{k-1} + 2^{99-k}) = 2^{100-k} - 2^{k-1} - 2^{99-k}\\nFrom earlier: 2y = (x+y) - (x-y) = 2^{100-k} - 2^k\\nSo y = 2^{99-k} - 2^{k-1}\\nYes.\\nFor k=2: y = 2^{97} - 2^{1} = 2^{97} - 2 >0, good.\\nx = 2^{1} + 2^{97} = 2 + 2^{97}\\nThen x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y) = 2^k * 2^{100-k} = 2^{100}, yes.\\nAnd y>0 since 97>1.\\nk<50, so k=1 to 49.\\nNow, are there solutions for other n?\\nOne more possibility: when n is a divisor of 100, and x=2^{100/n}, y=0, but y>0 not allowed.\\nOr if y=1, x^n = 2^100 +1, which is not a perfect power usually.\\nFor example, 2^100 +1 is a generalized Fermat number, not a perfect power.\\nSimilarly.\\nSo likely only n=2 gives solutions.\\nBut what about n=100? x^100 - y^100 =2^100\\nIf y=1, x^100 =2^100 +1, not a 100th power.\\nIf x=2, then 2^100 - y^100 =2^100, so y=0, not allowed.\\nSo no.\\nAnother thought: could there be solutions where n>2 and x/y is close to 1, but as above, difference is at least (y+1)^n - y^n > n y^{n-1}, and for y≥2, n≥3, this is at least 3*2^{2}=12, but more importantly, to reach 2^100, y must be large, but then the difference is not a pure power of 2.\\nGiven the time, and standard problems, the answer is likely 49 for the number of solutions.\\nBut the problem asks for ordered triples (x,y,n), so for each n, and for each solution.\\nSo far, only n=2 has solutions, with 49 pairs (x,y).\\nBut is there a solution for other n?\\nWhat if n=100, and x=2, y=0, but y not positive.\\nOr n=50, x=2, y=0, same.\\nOr perhaps when x=y, but then 0.\\nAnother idea: if n is even, say n=2m, then x^n - y^n = (x^m)^2 - (y^m)^2 = (x^m - y^m)(x^m + y^m) =2^100\\nThen this is similar to the n=2 case, but with x^m and y^m.\\nSet a=x^m, b=y^m, then a^2 - b^2 =2^100, same as before.\\nSo a - b =2^p, a + b =2^q, p+q=100, q>p, then a=2^{p-1} + 2^{q-1}, b=2^{q-1} - 2^{p-1}, with p≥1, q≥1, and b>0 so q-1 > p-1, i.e., q>p, and p<50 as before.\\nThen x^m = a = 2^{p-1} + 2^{q-1} = 2^{p-1} (1 + 2^{q-p})\\ny^m = b = 2^{p-1} (2^{q-p} - 1)\\nNow, for x and y to be integers, a and b must be perfect m-th powers.\\nSo 2^{p-1} (1 + 2^{q-p}) must be a perfect m-th power.\\nSimilarly for b.\\nLet k=p-1, d=q-p>0, then a=2^k (1 + 2^d)\\nb=2^k (2^d - 1)\\nNow, 1+2^d and 2^d -1 are coprime, since any common divisor divides (1+2^d) - (2^d -1) =2, but both odd, so gcd=1.\\nAlso, gcd(2^k, 1+2^d)=1 since 1+2^d odd.\\nSimilarly for b.\\nSo for a to be m-th power, we need 2^k = m-th power, and 1+2^d = m-th power.\\nSimilarly for b: 2^k = m-th power, and 2^d -1 = m-th power.\\nSo we need 2^k to be m-th power, so k must be divisible by m.\\nAnd 1+2^d = u^m for some integer u\\n2^d -1 = v^m for some integer v\\nBut 2^d -1 and 2^d +1 differ by 2, so v^m and u^m differ by 2.\\nFor m>1, the only consecutive m-th powers are 0 and 1, or 1 and 0, but here both positive for d≥2.\\nd=1: 2^1 -1=1=1^m, 2^1 +1=3, not m-th power for m>1.\\nd=2: 4-1=3, not m-th power; 4+1=5, not.\\nd=3:8-1=7,8+1=9=3^2, so for m=2, u=3.\\nSo d=3, m=2, then 2^d +1=9=3^2, 2^d -1=7, not a square.\\nBut we need both to be m-th powers.\\nHere 7 is not a square.\\nd=0 not allowed.\\nd=4:16-1=15, not; 16+1=17, not.\\nd=5:32-1=31,32+1=33, not.\\nd=6:64-1=63,64+1=65, not.\\nd=7:128-1=127,128+1=129, not.\\nd=8:256-1=255,256+1=257, not.\\nd=9:512-1=511,512+1=513, not.\\nd=10:1024-1=1023,1024+1=1025, not.\\nThe only time 2^d -1 is a perfect power is d=3, 8-1=7 not power; d=1,1=1^m; d=2,3 not; d=0,0, but d>0.\\n2^d -1 = v^m\\nFor m≥2, the only solution is d=3,v=2,m=3? 8-1=7≠8. 2^3-1=7 not cube. Known that 2^d -1 = v^m has only solution d=3,v=2,m=2? 7 not square. Actually, the only solution in integers is d=1,v=1,m any; d=3,v=2,m=3? 7≠8. Catalan conjecture (now theorem): the only solution in the natural numbers for a^x - b^y =1 with a,b,x,y >1 is 3^2 - 2^3 =1. Here we have 2^d - v^m =1, so v^m =2^d -1. For d>1, v>1, m>1, only solution is 3^2=9=8+1=2^3+1, not minus. 2^d - v^m =1, so v^m =2^d -1. For d=2,3; d=3,7; d=4,15; d=5,31; d=6,63; d=7,127; d=8,255; none are perfect powers. The only time a perfect power differs from a power of 2 by 1 is 9 and 8, but 9-8=1, so 3^2 - 2^3 =1, so 2^3 =3^2 -1, so v^m=3^2, 2^d=8, so 2^d - v^m =8-9= -1, not 1. We need 2^d - v^m =1, so v^m =2^d -1. Is there any? 2^1 -1=1=1^m, but v=1, and m>1, but 1^m=1, so for any m, but v=1. But in our case, for b=2^k (2^d -1) =2^k *1=2^k, and this must be m-th power, so 2^k = w^m, so k divisible by m. Also a=2^k (1+2^d)=2^k * (1+2)=3 * 2^k, must be m-th power. So 3 * 2^k = u^m. Since 3 is prime, for this to be m-th power, m must divide the exponent of 3, which is 1, so m=1, but n=2m>2, so m≥2, contradiction. So no solution when 2^d -1=1, i.e., d=1. For d>1, no solutions to 2^d -1 = v^m with v>1, m>1, by various theorems. So no solutions for n>2. Therefore, only solutions are for n=2, with 49 pairs (x,y). Each gives a triple (x,y,2). So 49 triples. But is that all? What about if n is not even? For odd n>1, we can argue similarly. For example, n=3, as before, no solutions likely. Since for n>2, no solutions, only n=2. So total 49 ordered triples. But let's confirm the number. For n=2, k=1 to 49, each gives a unique (x,y). For example, k=1: x=2^{0} + 2^{98} =1 + 2^{98}, y=2^{98} - 2^{0} =2^{98}-1 k=2: x=2^{1} + 2^{97} =2 + 2^{97}, y=2^{97} - 2^{1} =2^{97}-2 ... k=49: x=2^{48} + 2^{50} = 2^{48}(1 + 4) =5 * 2^{48}, y=2^{50} - 2^{48} = 2^{48}(4 - 1)=3 * 2^{48} All distinct. So 49 solutions. Therefore, answer to Problem 2 is 49. Problem 1 was k=1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"49\"\n}",
