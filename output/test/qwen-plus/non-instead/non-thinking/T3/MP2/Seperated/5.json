      "A1054": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $e = N - 86$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We are told there are 8 different blood antigens, and each student has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of these antigens. There are 256 students, and since 2^8 = 256, this implies that every possible subset of the 8 antigens corresponds to exactly one student's blood type. So the set of all blood types is exactly the power set of the 8 antigens.\\n\\nWe are asked to compute e = N - 86, where N is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen. Since the situation is symmetric across all antigens (no antigen is special), the number of students who have any particular antigen is the same for all antigens.\\n\\nFor a fixed antigen, say antigen A, how many subsets of the 8 antigens include A? \\n\\nEach subset either includes or excludes A. The total number of subsets is 256 = 2^8. The number of subsets that include A is 2^7 = 128, because we fix A to be included, and then choose any subset of the remaining 7 antigens freely.\\n\\nThus, N = 128 for any given antigen.\\n\\nThen e = N - 86 = 128 - 86 = 42.\\n\\nSo answer_1 = \\\"42\\\".\\n\\nProblem 2: Let the three integers James wrote down be a, b, c.\\n\\nAlex picks two of them, takes their average, and adds the third. So the three possible operations are:\\n\\n1. (a + b)/2 + c\\n2. (a + c)/2 + b\\n3. (b + c)/2 + a\\n\\nWe are told these expressions yield the values 42, 13, and 37 in some order.\\n\\nLet’s denote:\\n\\nx = (a + b)/2 + c = (a + b + 2c)/2\\ny = (a + c)/2 + b = (a + 2b + c)/2\\nz = (b + c)/2 + a = (2a + b + c)/2\\n\\nSet:\\nx = (a + b + 2c)/2\\ny = (a + 2b + c)/2\\nz = (2a + b + c)/2\\n\\nAnd {x, y, z} = {42, 13, 37}\\n\\nLet’s add all three:\\nx + y + z = [ (a + b + 2c) + (a + 2b + c) + (2a + b + c) ] / 2\\n= (4a + 4b + 4c)/2 = 2(a + b + c)\\n\\nOn the other hand, x + y + z = 42 + 13 + 37 = 92\\n\\nSo 2(a + b + c) = 92 → a + b + c = 46\\n\\nNow recall:\\nx = (a + b + 2c)/2 = ( (a + b + c) + c ) / 2 = (46 + c)/2\\nSimilarly:\\ny = (46 + b)/2\\nz = (46 + a)/2\\n\\nSo:\\nx = (46 + c)/2 ⇒ c = 2x - 46\\ny = (46 + b)/2 ⇒ b = 2y - 46\\nz = (46 + a)/2 ⇒ a = 2z - 46\\n\\nBut we don’t know which value corresponds to which expression. So try assigning the values 42, 13, 37 to x, y, z in some order.\\n\\nSince x = (46 + c)/2, and similarly for others, then:\\nc = 2x - 46\\nb = 2y - 46\\na = 2z - 46\\n\\nTry all permutations.\\n\\nBut note: since a, b, c should be integers, and x, y, z are rational, but from the form, if x is integer, then c = 2x - 46 is integer — so no issue.\\n\\nBut also, the values x, y, z must satisfy that a + b + c = 46.\\n\\nLet’s suppose:\\nLet’s suppose x = 42 → c = 2*42 - 46 = 84 - 46 = 38\\ny = 13 → b = 2*13 - 46 = 26 - 46 = -20\\nz = 37 → a = 2*37 - 46 = 74 - 46 = 28\\nThen a + b + c = 28 - 20 + 38 = 46 → correct.\\n\\nCheck if these match:\\na = 28, b = -20, c = 38\\n\\nNow compute the three expressions:\\n1. (a + b)/2 + c = (28 - 20)/2 + 38 = 8/2 + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42 ✓\\n2. (a + c)/2 + b = (28 + 38)/2 + (-20) = 66/2 - 20 = 33 - 20 = 13 ✓\\n3. (b + c)/2 + a = (-20 + 38)/2 + 28 = 18/2 + 28 = 9 + 28 = 37 ✓\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nSo the three integers are 28, -20, 38.\\n\\nOrder doesn't matter. So answer_2 = \\\"28, -20, 38\\\"\\n\\nBut let’s check if other permutations give consistent results.\\nSuppose x = 42 → c = 38\\ny = 37 → b = 2*37 - 46 = 74 - 46 = 28\\nz = 13 → a = 2*13 - 46 = 26 - 46 = -20\\nThen a = -20, b = 28, c = 38 → same set.\\nSimilarly, all permutations will give the same triple up to order.\\n\\nSo the three integers are -20, 28, 38.\\n\\nWe can write them in any order, but perhaps sorted or as found.\\n\\nThe problem asks: what are the three integers?\\nAnswer: -20, 28, 38\\n\\nBut in our first assignment: a = 28, b = -20, c = 38 → so writing as 28, -20, 38 is fine.\\n\\nTo be neat, maybe sort them: -20, 28, 38\\n\\nBut the problem doesn't specify order. However, in the answer, we need to provide exact text.\\n\\nLooking back, in our derivation, we got a = 28, b = -20, c = 38 when assigning z=37, y=13, x=42.\\n\\nBut since the question just asks for the three integers, we can list them in any order. To match common format, perhaps ascending.\\n\\nBut the example output uses simple quotes. Let's use: \\\"-20, 28, 38\\\"\\n\\nAlternatively, the system might expect the exact values without sorting. But since no order is implied, any order is acceptable.\\n\\nBut to be safe, let's present them in the order we computed: 28, -20, 38 — but better to sort.\\n\\nActually, no preference. Let's go with sorted: -20, 28, 38.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nanswer_1: \\\"42\\\"\\nanswer_2: \\\"-20, 28, 38\\\"\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"42\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-20, 28, 38\"\n}",
