      "A401": "Trevor and Edward play a game in which they take turns adding or removing beans from a pile. On each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. The player who empties the pile wins. For example, if Trevor goes first with a pile of 5 beans, he can either add 4 to make the total 9, or remove 4 to make the total 1, and either way Edward wins by removing all the beans. There is no limit to how large the pile can grow; it just starts with some finite number of beans in it, say fewer than 1000. Before the game begins, Edward dispatches a spy to find out how many beans will be in the opening pile, call this $n$, then \"graciously\" offers to let Trevor go first. Knowing that the first player is more likely to win, but not knowing $n$, Trevor logically but unwisely accepts, and Edward goes on to win the game. Find a number $n$ less than 1000 that would prompt this scenario, assuming both players are perfect logicians. A correct answer is worth the nearest integer to $\\log _{2}(n-4)$ points. Instead of finding an initial pile size $n$ less than 1000 that is a losing position for the first player under perfect play, simply find $k = s(p) - 6$, where $p$ is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example, and $s(p)$ is the largest perfect square at most $p$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We are told that in the example, Trevor starts with a pile of 5 beans. The largest perfect square less than or equal to 5 is 4. So he can either add 4 beans (making 9) or remove 4 beans (making 1). The problem says Edward wins either way. Then we are asked not to find such an n < 1000 where the first player loses under perfect play, but instead to compute k = s(p) - 6, where p is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example.\\n\\nIn the example, initial pile is 5. The largest perfect square ≤ 5 is 4. Adding it gives: 5 + 4 = 9. So p = 9.\\n\\nNow, s(p) is defined as the largest perfect square at most p. Since p = 9, and 9 is a perfect square (3²), s(9) = 9.\\n\\nThen k = s(p) - 6 = 9 - 6 = 3.\\n\\nSo answer_1 = \\\"3\\\".\\n\\nProblem 2: We are to count the number of distinct colorings of the vertices of a tetrahedron using three colors—red, blue, green—such that no face has all three vertices the same color. Two colorings are considered the same if one can be rotated to match the other. So we are counting orbits under the action of the rotation group of the tetrahedron on the set of valid colorings.\\n\\nThe tetrahedron has 4 vertices. Each vertex can be colored in 3 ways, so total colorings without symmetry: 3^4 = 81.\\n\\nBut we must subtract those colorings where at least one face has all three vertices the same color, and then account for rotational symmetry.\\n\\nHowever, the condition is: no face has all three vertices the same color. That means for every triangular face, the three vertices cannot all be red, all blue, or all green.\\n\\nBut note: there are 4 faces on a tetrahedron, each a triangle of 3 vertices.\\n\\nWe are to count colorings (up to rotation) such that on every face, not all three vertices are the same color.\\n\\nApproach: Use Burnside’s Lemma to count the number of distinct colorings under rotation, satisfying the coloring constraint.\\n\\nStep 1: Understand the rotation group of the tetrahedron.\\nThe rotation group of the tetrahedron is A4, the alternating group on 4 elements, which has 12 elements.\\n\\nThe conjugacy classes of A4:\\n- Identity: 1 element\\n- Rotations by 120° and 240° around a vertex (fixing one vertex and cycling the opposite face): 8 elements (4 axes × 2 nontrivial rotations each)\\n- Rotations by 180° swapping two pairs of opposite edges: 3 elements\\n\\nSo conjugacy classes:\\n1. Identity: 1\\n2. 8 cycles of order 3 (vertex-face rotations)\\n3. 3 double transpositions (180° edge swaps)\\n\\nBurnside’s Lemma: Number of distinct colorings = (1/|G|) Σ_{g ∈ G} Fix(g), where Fix(g) is the number of colorings fixed by the group element g that satisfy the constraint.\\n\\nBut wait — we cannot directly apply Burnside to unrestricted colorings and then subtract invalid ones. Instead, we should consider only colorings that satisfy the constraint (no monochromatic face), and count orbits under rotation.\\n\\nBetter approach: First, list all colorings (with 3 colors, 4 vertices) such that no face is monochromatic, then use Burnside to count orbits among these.\\n\\nBut Burnside counts orbits by averaging fixed points. So we need to compute, for each group element, how many valid colorings (i.e., satisfying the no-monochromatic-face condition) are fixed by that group element.\\n\\nLet’s proceed step by step.\\n\\nTotal colorings: 3^4 = 81\\n\\nFirst, let’s characterize the constraints.\\nEach face consists of 3 vertices. There are 4 faces in a tetrahedron. Label the vertices A, B, C, D.\\nFaces: ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.\\nA coloring is invalid if any of these faces has all three vertices the same color.\\n\\nWe want colorings where none of the four faces is monochromatic.\\n\\nBut we also want to consider symmetry: two colorings are the same if one can be rotated to the other.\\n\\nSo we’ll use Burnside’s Lemma, but restrict to colorings where no face is monochromatic.\\n\\nFor each group element g, compute the number of colorings fixed by g that satisfy the no-monochromatic-face condition.\\n\\nStep 1: Identity rotation (1 element)\\nAll colorings are fixed. So we need to count total number of colorings with 3 colors on 4 vertices such that no face is monochromatic.\\n\\nTotal colorings: 3^4 = 81\\n\\nSubtract colorings where at least one face is monochromatic.\\nUse inclusion-exclusion.\\n\\nLet F1 = face ABC monochromatic\\nF2 = ABD\\nF3 = ACD\\nF4 = BCD\\n\\nWe want |¬F1 ∧ ¬F2 ∧ ¬F3 ∧ ¬F4| = Total - Σ|Fi| + Σ|Fi ∧ Fj| - Σ|Fi ∧ Fj ∧ Fk| + |F1 ∧ F2 ∧ F3 ∧ F4|\\n\\nCompute |\\n\\n|Fi|: For a single face, say ABC, all three same color: 3 choices for the color of ABC, then 3 choices for D → 3×3 = 9\\nThere are 4 faces → Σ|Fi| = 4×9 = 36\\n\\n|Fi ∧ Fj|: intersection of two faces.\\nCase 1: Two faces sharing two vertices (e.g., ABC and ABD): they share AB. If both are monochromatic, then ABC all color X, ABD all color Y.\\nIf X ≠ Y, then C is X, D is Y, but A and B must be both X and Y → contradiction unless X=Y.\\nSo X=Y. Then A,B,C,D: A,B,C=X, A,B,D=X → so C=D=X. So all four vertices are X. So the whole coloring is constant.\\nSimilarly, if two faces intersect in two vertices, then their monochromatic condition forces all four vertices same color.\\nHow many such pairs? Faces sharing an edge: each edge is shared by two faces. Number of edges: 6. But number of pairs of faces: \\\\binom{4}{2}=6. Each pair of faces shares exactly one edge (since any two faces share two vertices). Yes, in tetrahedron, any two faces share an edge.\\nSo all 6 pairs are like this.\\nFor each such pair, |Fi ∧ Fj| = number of colorings where both faces monochromatic = number of constant colorings = 3 (all red, all blue, all green)\\nSo Σ|Fi ∧ Fj| = 6×3 = 18\\n\\n|Fi ∧ Fj ∧ Fk|: three faces. Say ABC, ABD, ACD.\\nABC mono: A=B=C=X\\nABD mono: A=B=D=Y → X=Y, so D=X\\nACD mono: A=C=D=Z → Z=X\\nSo A=B=C=D=X\\nSo again, constant coloring.\\nSimilarly for any three faces, forces all four vertices same color.\\nNumber of such triples: \\\\binom{4}{3}=4\\nEach contributes 3 colorings (the constant ones)\\nSo Σ = 4×3 = 12\\n\\n|F1 ∧ F2 ∧ F3 ∧ F4| = all four faces mono → again forces constant coloring → 3\\n\\nSo by inclusion-exclusion:\\nNumber of colorings with at least one monochromatic face =\\n36 - 18 + 12 - 3 = let's compute:\\n36 - 18 = 18\\n18 + 12 = 30\\n30 - 3 = 27\\nWait: inclusion-exclusion:\\nΣ|Fi| = 36\\nΣ|Fi ∧ Fj| = 18\\nΣ|Fi ∧ Fj ∧ Fk| = 12\\n|F1∧F2∧F3∧F4| = 3\\nSo |\\n\\nUnion = Σ|Fi| - Σ|Fi∧Fj| + Σ|Fi∧Fj∧Fk| - |F1∧...∧F4|\\n= 36 - 18 + 12 - 3 = (36 - 18)=18; 18+12=30; 30-3=27\\n\\nSo 27 colorings have at least one monochromatic face.\\nThus, number of valid colorings (no monochromatic face) = 81 - 27 = 54\\n\\nBut this includes all assignments, not up to symmetry.\\n\\nNow, back to Burnside.\\nWe need to compute, for each group element, the number of valid colorings fixed by that element.\\n\\n1. Identity: fixes all colorings. So fixes 54 valid colorings.\\n\\n2. Rotations of order 3: 8 elements. These are rotations by 120° and 240° around a vertex, cycling the other three.\\nFor example, fix vertex D, cycle A→B→C→A.\\nThis permutation is a 3-cycle on A,B,C, D fixed.\\nA coloring is fixed by this rotation iff A,B,C have the same color, and D arbitrary.\\nSo color(A)=color(B)=color(C)=X, color(D)=Y, X,Y ∈ {R,B,G}\\nSo 3 choices for X, 3 for Y → 9 colorings fixed by this rotation.\\nBut we need only those that are valid, i.e., no monochromatic face.\\nCheck the faces:\\nFace ABC: A,B,C all X → this face is monochromatic! → invalid.\\nSo all such fixed colorings have face ABC monochromatic → thus, none of them are valid.\\nTherefore, for each such rotation, number of valid fixed colorings is 0.\\nThere are 8 such rotations → contribute 0 each.\\n\\n3. Rotations of order 2: 180° rotations that swap two pairs of vertices. There are 3 such rotations.\\nFor example, swap A and B, swap C and D.\\nThis corresponds to a double transposition: (A B)(C D)\\nA coloring is fixed by this iff color(A)=color(B), color(C)=color(D)\\nSo let X = color(A)=color(B), Y = color(C)=color(D), X,Y ∈ {R,B,G}\\nTotal such colorings: 3×3=9\\nNow, check which of these are valid (no monochromatic face)\\nFaces:\\nABC: vertices A(X), B(X), C(Y) → colors X,X,Y → monochromatic only if X=Y\\nSimilarly, ABD: A(X), B(X), D(Y) → X,X,Y → mono only if X=Y\\nACD: A(X), C(Y), D(Y) → X,Y,Y → mono only if X=Y\\nBCD: B(X), C(Y), D(Y) → X,Y,Y → mono only if X=Y\\nAlso, face ABC: already covered.\\nIs there a face with three same? Only if X=Y, then all vertices same color → all faces monochromatic.\\nIf X ≠ Y, then:\\n- ABC: X,X,Y → not all same\\n- ABD: X,X,Y → not all same\\n- ACD: X,Y,Y → not all same\\n- BCD: X,Y,Y → not all same\\nSo no face is monochromatic.\\nThus, when X ≠ Y, the coloring is valid.\\nNumber of such: X and Y different: 3 choices for X, 2 for Y → 6\\nWhen X=Y: 3 cases (all red, etc.), all invalid.\\nSo for each such rotation, number of valid fixed colorings is 6.\\nThere are 3 such rotations → total contribution: 3 × 6 = 18\\n\\nNow sum over all group elements:\\n- Identity: 54\\n- 8 rotations of order 3: 8 × 0 = 0\\n- 3 rotations of order 2: 3 × 6 = 18\\nTotal sum of fixed valid colorings: 54 + 0 + 18 = 72\\n\\n|G| = 12\\nSo number of distinct valid colorings up to rotation = 72 / 12 = 6\\n\\nSo answer_2 = \\\"6\\\"\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: k = 3\\nProblem 2: 6\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
