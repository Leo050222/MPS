Then the equation becomes:\\n\\n$$\\ns(s - 1) = n - 1 \\\\Rightarrow n = s(s - 1) + 1 = s^2 - s + 1\\n$$\\n\\nSo $ n = s^2 - s + 1 $, and we also know that $ S(n) = s $. Our goal is to find the smallest such $ n $, so we try small values of $ s $ (starting from 1) and check whether $ S(s^2 - s + 1) = s $.\\n\\nTry $ s = 1 $:\\n$ n = 1^2 - 1 + 1 = 1 $, $ S(1) = 1 $ → OK. So this works.\\n\\nIs $ n = 1 $ valid? Check original equation:\\n$ S(1) = 1 $, so left side: $ 1(1 - 1) = 0 $, right side: $ 1 - 1 = 0 $. Yes, it works.\\n\\nSo the smallest $ n $ is 1, $ S(n) = 1 $, then $ k = S(n) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 $.\\n\\nWait — but let's double-check if there could be a smaller $ n $? No, since $ n = 1 $ is the smallest positive integer. So unless we missed something, $ k = 5 $.\\n\\nBut let's test a few more $ s $ to ensure no smaller $ n $ exists? No, $ n $ increases with $ s $, and $ s = 1 $ gives $ n = 1 $, which is minimal.\\n\\nSo answer for Problem 1: $ k = 5 $.\\n\\nBut wait — is $ S(1) = 1 $, yes. Equation: $ 1 \\\\cdot 0 = 0 = 1 - 1 $. Correct.\\n\\nSo $ k = 1 + 4 = 5 $.\\n\\nHowever, let's test $ s = 2 $: $ n = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3 $, $ S(3) = 3 \\\\ne 2 $? No, $ S(3) = 3 \\\\ne 2 $. Not valid.\\n\\ns = 3: n = 9 - 3 + 1 = 7, S(7) = 7 ≠ 3\\ns = 4: n = 16 - 4 + 1 = 13, S(13) = 1+3=4 → yes! S(n)=4.\\nCheck: left side: 4*3=12, n-1=12 → yes.\\nSo n=13 also works.\\nBut n=1 is smaller.\\n\\nBut wait: n=1: S(n)=1, so 1*0=0, n-1=0 → yes.\\nSo n=1 is valid and smallest.\\nThus k = 1 + 4 = 5.\\n\\nBut let me confirm: is there any constraint that n > 1? The problem says positive integer, so n=1 is allowed.\\n\\nSo answer is 5.\\n\\nBut wait — double-check S(1): sum of digits of 1 is 1. Yes.\\nEquation: 1*(1-1)=0, n-1=0. Correct.\\n\\nSo k = 1 + 4 = 5.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nPenta chooses 5 vertices of a unit cube. We are to find the maximum possible volume of the convex hull (or the polyhedron) formed by these 5 points.\\n\\nA unit cube has side length 1. Volume is to be maximized.\\n\\nNote: The volume of a solid defined by 5 points depends on their configuration.\\n\\nIdea: To maximize volume, the 5 points should be as far apart as possible, preferably including vertices that form a large tetrahedron or pyramid.\\n\\nThe maximum volume polyhedron with vertices among cube’s vertices will likely be a pyramid over a tetrahedron or a quadrilateral base.\\n\\nBut with 5 points, the convex hull can be:\\n- A triangular bipyramid\\n- A square pyramid\\n- A tetrahedron with an extra point inside (but that would reduce volume)\\n- Or a polyhedron with quadrilateral base and one apex\\n\\nBest bet: choose 5 points that form a pyramid with a large base.\\n\\nBut in a cube, can we get a regular tetrahedron? No, but we can get a tetrahedron with volume 1/3?\\n\\nActually, the maximum volume tetrahedron inside a unit cube has volume 1/3? Let me recall.\\n\\nStandard result: the maximum volume of a tetrahedron with vertices among the cube’s vertices is 1/3. For example, take (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). Then volume is:\\n\\nVolume of tetrahedron with vertices A,B,C,D is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{6} | \\\\det(\\\\vec{AB}, \\\\vec{AC}, \\\\vec{AD}) |\\n$$\\n\\nTake A=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1)\\n\\nVectors:\\nAB = (1,1,0)\\nAC = (1,0,1)\\nAD = (0,1,1)\\n\\nMatrix:\\n|\\n1 1 0\\n1 0 1\\n0 1 1\\n| → determinant:\\n\\n= 1*(0*1 - 1*1) - 1*(1*1 - 0*1) + 0*(1*1 - 0*0)\\n= 1*(-1) - 1*(1) + 0 = -1 -1 = -2 → abs value 2\\n\\nVolume = 1/6 * 2 = 1/3. Yes.\\n\\nBut we have 5 points. Can we add a fifth point to increase the volume beyond 1/3?\\n\\nThe convex hull of 5 points might have larger volume than any tetrahedron.\\n\\nIdea: consider a square pyramid. Suppose we take a face of the cube (a unit square), and take the opposite face, and pick one vertex from the opposite face.\\n\\nBut the height would be 1, base area 1, volume of pyramid = (1/3)*base*height = 1/3.\\nSame as tetrahedron.\\n\\nBut can we do better?\\n\\nAnother idea: take 5 points such that they form a polyhedron with more volume.\\n\\nKnown result: The maximum volume polyhedron with 5 vertices in the unit cube is achieved when the five points are those of a regular triangular bipyramid? But cube is not symmetric that way.\\n\\nAlternatively, consider choosing four points forming a regular tetrahedron? But in cube, no regular tetrahedron.\\n\\nWait — another configuration: take all points except three that meet at a corner? Not helpful.\\n\\nThink differently: total cube volume is 1. We want subset of 5 vertices whose convex hull has maximum volume.\\n\\nNote: the convex hull of 5 vertices of a cube can at most be a polyhedron with volume less than 1.\\n\\nCan we get more than 1/3?\\n\\nTry this configuration: take one face (a square), say bottom face: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,0). That’s 4 points. Now add a point not on this plane, say (0,0,1).\\n\\nThen the convex hull is a square pyramid with base area 1, height 1 (from z=0 to z=1), but the apex is (0,0,1), not directly above center.\\n\\nThe base is in z=0, apex at (0,0,1). Is this a right pyramid? No, apex is at corner.\\n\\nThis pyramid has volume? We can divide into two tetrahedrons.\\n\\nTetrahedron 1: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,0,1)\\nTetrahedron 2: (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)\\nBut they overlap? Better to use formula.\\n\\nAlternatively, the volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * base_area * height, but only if the apex is perpendicularly above the base. Here, the apex (0,0,1) is not above the centroid; it's above a corner. So the height is not uniform.\\n\\nIn fact, this pyramid is degenerate? No, but its volume is less than 1/3.\\n\\nCompute:\\nUse the scalar triple product.\\n\\nDivide the square pyramid into two tetrahedrons:\\n\\nTetra 1: A=(0,0,0), B=(1,0,0), C=(1,1,0), D=(0,0,1)\\nVectors AB=(1,0,0), AC=(1,1,0), AD=(0,0,1)\\nDet = |1 0 0|\\n      |1 1 0|\\n      |0 0 1| = 1*(1*1 - 0*0) = 1\\nVolume = 1/6\\n\\nTetra 2: A=(0,0,0), C=(1,1,0), E=(0,1,0), D=(0,0,1)\\nVectors AC=(1,1,0), AE=(0,1,0), AD=(0,0,1)\\nMatrix:\\n1 1 0\\n0 1 0\\n0 0 1 → det = 1*(1*1 - 0*0) = 1 → volume 1/6\\n\\nBut do these two tetrahedrons fill the pyramid without overlap? The pyramid has faces: base and four triangles. The two tetras share the face A-C-D? But point E=(0,1,0) is included.\\n\\nPoints: base: A,B,C,E. Apex D.\\n\\nTetra 1: A,B,C,D\\nTetra 2: A,C,E,D\\n\\nDo they cover the whole pyramid? The edge B-E is not directly connected, but in convex hull, yes. However, the point (0.5,0.5,0) is in base, but is it in either tetra? In tetra A,B,C,D: points A,B,C are in z=0, D up. This tetra covers triangle A,B,C and lines to D. Similarly, tetra A,C,E,D covers triangle A,C,E.\\n\\nBut triangle A,C,E and A,B,C together make quadrilateral A,B,C,E? Only if they share diagonal A-C. But in the base, if we use diagonal A-C, then yes, the base is divided into triangle ABC and triangle ACE? But ACE includes E=(0,1,0), C=(1,1,0), A=(0,0,0). That's correct.\\n\\nBut ABC: A,B,C — that's (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(1,1,0) — a triangle.\\nACE: A,C,E — (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(0,1,0) — another triangle.\\nTogether they make the square.\\n\\nAnd both tetrahedrons include D. So the union is the pyramid.\\n\\nTotal volume = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3.\\n\\nSame as before.\\n\\nBut can we get more?\\n\\nTry a different configuration: suppose we take a tetrahedron of volume 1/3, and add a fifth point outside. But in the cube, all points are vertices.\\n\\nSuppose we take five points that include both ends of a space diagonal.\\n\\nAnother idea: take four points that are not coplanar, forming a tetrahedron, and the fifth point extends it.\\n\\nBut the convex hull might become a polyhedron with more volume.\\n\\nKnown result: The maximum volume is 1/2.\\n\\nHow? Consider taking five points such that they form a polyhedron that is half the cube.\\n\\nFor example, take all vertices with x+y+z even? No, that’s four points.\\n\\nTry: take one entire face (4 points) and the opposite vertex? But opposite vertex may not exist.\\n\\nSuppose we take the bottom face: z=0: (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(1,1,0),(0,1,0)\\nAnd top vertex (0.5,0.5,1)? No, only vertices.\\n\\nTake (1,1,1) — diagonally opposite to (0,0,0).\\n\\nNow, the convex hull of the bottom face and (1,1,1).\\n\\nThis is a square pyramid with apex at (1,1,1), base at z=0.\\n\\nBase area = 1, height = 1 (z-direction), and since apex is above the corner (1,1,0), again not centered.\\n\\nBut let's compute volume.\\n\\nDivide into two tetrahedrons:\\n\\nTetra 1: (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,1,1)\\nVectors from (0,0,0): (1,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,1,1)\\nDet = |1 0 0|\\n      |1 1 0|\\n      |1 1 1| = 1*(1*1 - 0*1) = 1 → vol 1/6\\n\\nTetra 2: (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(0,1,0),(1,1,1)\\nVectors: (1,1,0),(0,1,0),(1,1,1)\\nMatrix:\\n1 1 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 1\\nDet = 1*(1*1 - 0*1) - 1*(0*1 - 0*1) + 0 = 1 - 0 = 1 → vol 1/6\\n\\nTotal 1/3 again.\\n\\nStill 1/3.\\n\\nBut perhaps a non-pyramidal shape.\\n\\nIdea: take a triangular bipyramid.\\n\\nOr take five points that form a polyhedron with two tetrahedrons sharing a face, but extending in different directions.\\n\\nAnother idea: take all points except three that are mutually adjacent.\\n\\nTotal 8 vertices. Choose 5, so omit 3.\\n\\nTo maximize volume, omit three that are close together.\\n\\nSuppose we omit three vertices around a corner, say (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0). Then remaining: (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1)\\n\\nList:\\n- (0,0,1)\\n- (1,0,1)\\n- (0,1,1)\\n- (1,1,0)\\n- (1,1,1)\\n\\nNow, what is the convex hull?\\n\\nPlot:\\nAll have at least two coordinates 1, except (1,1,0) has z=0.\\n\\nPoints:\\nA=(0,0,1), B=(1,0,1), C=(0,1,1), D=(1,1,0), E=(1,1,1)\\n\\nE is (1,1,1), common.\\n\\nThis looks like a pyramid over a quadrilateral? Or a tetrahedron plus a point.\\n\\nNote that A,B,C,E are four points with z=1 except D.\\n\\nA,B,C,E: A,B,C are at z=1, E at z=1. D at (1,1,0).\\n\\nActually, A,B,C,E form a tetrahedron? But they are not coplanar.\\n\\nBut let's see the convex hull.\\n\\nNotice that D=(1,1,0), E=(1,1,1), so along edge.\\n\\nPerhaps this hull includes the point (1,1,1) and spreads out.\\n\\nWe can compute the volume by dividing into tetrahedrons.\\n\\nChoose a common vertex, say E=(1,1,1).\\n\\nThen form tetrahedrons with E and each face of the convex hull of the other four.\\n\\nBut first, what is the convex hull of A,B,C,D?\\n\\nA=(0,0,1), B=(1,0,1), C=(0,1,1), D=(1,1,0)\\n\\nThese four points: A,B,C are at z=1, forming a triangle, D at (1,1,0).\\n\\nAre they coplanar? Probably not.\\n\\nVectors from A: AB=(1,0,0), AC=(0,1,0), AD=(1,1,-1)\\n\\nNormal to AB and AC is (0,0,1), dot AD = -1 ≠ 0, so not coplanar.\\n\\nSo they form a tetrahedron.\\n\\nVolume of tetrahedron A,B,C,D:\\nVectors AB=(1,0,0), AC=(0,1,0), AD=(1,1,-1)\\nDet of matrix with rows (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,-1):\\n= 1*(1*(-1) - 0*1) - 0 + 0 = -1 → abs 1, volume 1/6\\n\\nBut now adding E=(1,1,1), which is outside.\\n\\nThe full convex hull of five points may be the convex hull of this tetrahedron and E.\\n\\nBut E may be such that the hull is a polyhedron with more volume.\\n\\nSince E is at (1,1,1), and D is at (1,1,0), etc.\\n\\nNote that E is adjacent to B,C,D.\\n\\nPerhaps the convex hull has faces: triangle A,B,C (top), and then down to D and E.\\n\\nBut let's list all points and see which are vertices.\\n\\nAll five are likely vertices.\\n\\nNow, to compute volume, we can use the following method: pick a point, say A, and form tetrahedrons with A and each face of the convex hull of the other four.\\n\\nBut complicated.\\n\\nBetter: use the fact that the maximum volume is known to be 1/2 for 5 vertices of a unit cube.\\n\\nHow? Take a regular simplex? No.\\n\\nAnother configuration: take all vertices with at least two coordinates equal to 1.\\n\\nThat would be:\\nx=1,y=1,z=0: (1,1,0)\\nx=1,y=1,z=1: (1,1,1)\\nx=1,y=0,z=1: (1,0,1)\\nx=0,y=1,z=1: (0,1,1)\\nx=1,y=1,z=0: already have\\nAlso (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1), and (1,0,0)? No, (1,0,0) has only one 1.\\n\\nAt least two 1's:\\n- (1,1,0)\\n- (1,0,1)\\n- (0,1,1)\\n- (1,1,1)\\n- (1,1,0) duplicate\\nOnly four points? Missing one.\\n(1,0,0) has one 1, not included.\\n(0,0,1) has one 1.\\nSo only four vertices have at least two 1's? No:\\nList all:\\n(0,0,0): zero 1's\\n(1,0,0): one\\n(0,1,0): one\\n(0,0,1): one\\n(1,1,0): two\\n(1,0,1): two\\n(0,1,1): two\\n(1,1,1): three\\nSo exactly four vertices with at least two 1's? No, three with exactly two, one with three, total four.\\nBut we need five.\\n\\nTake all except the three with only one 1? That would be remove (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), and keep:\\n(0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1)\\n\\nFive points: A=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1), E=(1,1,1)\\n\\nThis is the same as earlier when I removed three around a corner, but now removing the three with one 1, keeping (0,0,0) and the four with many 1's.\\n\\nNow, what is the convex hull?\\n\\nPoints: origin, and the three face-diagonals, and the opposite corner.\\n\\nThis is symmetric.\\n\\nIn fact, this is a regular tetrahedron? No.\\n\\nBut let's compute volume.\\n\\nI recall that the convex hull of these five points is a polyhedron that fills half the cube.\\n\\nIndeed, these five points include (0,0,0) and (1,1,1), and the three adjacent to (1,1,1) but not to (0,0,0) in a certain way.\\n\\nNote that all points satisfy x+y+z ≤ 2? (0,0,0):0, (1,1,0):2, (1,0,1):2, (0,1,1):2, (1,1,1):3>2, so no.\\n\\nAlternatively, the cube can be divided by the plane x+y+z=1.5 or something.\\n\\nBut let's calculate the volume.\\n\\nOne way: the convex hull of these five points includes the tetrahedron (1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1) which has volume 1/3 as before, and also includes (0,0,0), so it's larger.\\n\\nWe can divide the hull into tetrahedrons.\\n\\nFor example, from (0,0,0), connect to the faces.\\n\\nThe other four points: B,C,D,E: (1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1)\\n\\nTheir convex hull is a tetrahedron? Are they coplanar? No, as before, volume 1/3? Earlier calculation was for different points.\\n\\nCompute volume of tetrahedron B,C,D,E:\\nB=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1), E=(1,1,1)\\nVectors from B: BC=(0,-1,1), BD=(-1,0,1), BE=(0,0,1)\\nMatrix:\\n0 -1 1\\n-1 0 1\\n0 0 1\\nDet = 0*det - (-1)*det([-1,1],[0,1]) + 1*det([-1,0],[0,0])\\n= 0 + 1*[ -1*1 - 1*0 ] + 1*[0] = 1*(-1) = -1 → abs 1, volume 1/6\\n\\nNot 1/3.\\n\\nEarlier tetrahedron was (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1) — let's compute that.\\nA=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1)\\nVectors AB=(1,1,0), AC=(1,0,1), AD=(0,1,1)\\nDet: |1 1 0|\\n     |1 0 1|\\n     |0 1 1| = 1*(0*1-1*1) -1*(1*1-1*0) +0 = 1*(-1) -1*(1) = -1-1=-2 → vol 2/6=1/3. Yes.\\n\\nBut in our set, we have that tetrahedron plus E=(1,1,1), but we also have (0,0,0), which is A.\\n\\nOur five points are A,B,C,D,E: (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1)\\n\\nThe convex hull includes the tetrahedron A,B,C,D of volume 1/3, and also E.\\n\\nE is outside this tetrahedron.\\n\\nTo find the full volume, we can see how much is added.\\n\\nThe full convex hull can be divided into several tetrahedrons.\\n\\nFor example, we can take tetrahedron A,B,C,E; A,B,D,E; A,C,D,E; and B,C,D,E; but there might be overlap.\\n\\nBetter to use a systematic approach.\\n\\nNote that these five points are all the vertices of the cube except the three with exactly one 1: (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1).\\n\\nThe convex hull of these five points is actually a polyhedron known as a square pyramid or something else?\\n\\nObserve that points B,C,D,E are not coplanar, but let's see the structure.\\n\\nI recall that this configuration gives a volume of 1/2.\\n\\nLet me try to compute.\\n\\nUse the following: the volume can be calculated as the sum of volumes of tetrahedrons formed by a fixed point and each face, but only if the point is inside, which it's not.\\n\\nChoose point A=(0,0,0) as apex.\\n\\nThe other four points B,C,D,E form a quadrilateral? But they are not coplanar.\\n\\nFind if they are coplanar: points (1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1)\\n\\nVector BC=(0,-1,1), BD=(-1,0,1), BE=(0,0,1)\\nNormal to BC and BD: cross product:\\ni( (-1)*1 - 1*0 ) -j( 0*1 - 1*(-1) ) +k( 0*0 - (-1)*(-1) ) = i(-1) -j(1) +k(-1) = (-1,-1,-1)\\nDot with BE=(0,0,1) = -1 ≠ 0, so not coplanar.\\n\\nSo the convex hull has triangular faces.\\n\\nPerhaps the hull has faces: triangle A,B,C; A,B,D; A,C,D; and then E connected.\\n\\nNote that E=(1,1,1) is adjacent.\\n\\nActually, a better way: the convex hull of these five points is a polyhedron with five vertices, and it can be divided into three tetrahedrons, for example:\\n\\n1. Tetrahedron A,B,C,E\\n2. Tetrahedron A,C,D,E\\n3. Tetrahedron A,B,D,E\\n\\nBut do they cover everything and overlap only on faces?\\n\\nFirst, tetra A,B,C,E: points (0,0,0),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(1,1,1)\\nVolume: vectors from A: AB=(1,1,0), AC=(1,0,1), AE=(1,1,1)\\nDet: |1 1 0|\\n     |1 0 1|\\n     |1 1 1| = 1*(0*1-1*1) -1*(1*1-1*1) +0 = 1*(-1) -1*(0) = -1 → vol 1/6\\n\\nTetra A,C,D,E: A=(0,0,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1), E=(1,1,1)\\nVectors AC=(1,0,1), AD=(0,1,1), AE=(1,1,1)\\nMatrix:\\n1 0 1\\n0 1 1\\n1 1 1\\nDet = 1*(1*1-1*1) -0 +1*(0*1-1*1) = 1*0 + 1*(-1) = -1 → vol 1/6\\n\\nTetra A,B,D,E: A=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), D=(0,1,1), E=(1,1,1)\\nVectors AB=(1,1,0), AD=(0,1,1), AE=(1,1,1)\\nMatrix:\\n1 1 0\\n0 1 1\\n1 1 1\\nDet = 1*(1*1-1*1) -1*(0*1-1*1) +0 = 1*0 -1*(-1) = 1 → vol 1/6\\n\\nSum: 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/2\\n\\nNow, do these three tetrahedrons cover the entire convex hull without overlap?\\n\\nThe convex hull should also include the tetrahedron B,C,D,E, but in this division, is it covered?\\n\\nPoint B,C,D,E: for example, the point (1,1,1) is in all, but interior points.\\n\\nThe three tetrahedrons share the edge A-E, and each has a face on the 'equator'.\\n\\nMoreover, the region near B,C,D might not be fully covered, but since we have tetra involving them, and the only missing part might be the tetrahedron B,C,D,E, but in this case, the point (1,1,1) is included, but the tetrahedron B,C,D,E is not entirely in the union because, for example, the centroid of B,C,D,E might not be in any of the three tetrahedrons if they are on the other side.\\n\\nLet's see: the three tetrahedrons are all incident to A, so they are on the 'A-side'.\\n\\nBut the point E is far, and B,C,D are spread.\\n\\nActually, the convex hull includes points that are convex combinations, and since A is a vertex, and the other four are on the opposite side, likely the hull is star-shaped from A, and these three tetrahedrons cover it if the quadrilateral B,C,D,E is triangulated properly.\\n\\nBut B,C,D,E are four points, and we have three tetrahedrons: A-B-C-E, A-C-D-E, A-B-D-E. This corresponds to triangulating the quadrilateral B-C-D-E with diagonals, but here we have triangles B-C-E, C-D-E, B-D-E, which suggests that we are using triangles that include E, but the face between B,C,D is not directly covered.\\n\\nSpecifically, the triangle B,C,D: is it part of the boundary? Points B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1), D=(0,1,1)\\n\\nThis triangle may be inside the hull or on the boundary.\\n\\nIn the cube, these three points are not coplanar with others, but let's see if the tetrahedron B,C,D,E is part of the hull.\\n\\nEarlier we computed its volume as 1/6, but in our sum, we have three tetrahedrons of 1/6 each, summing to 1/2, while the whole cube is 1, so plausible.\\n\\nMoreover, I recall that this configuration gives volume 1/2.\\n\\nTo confirm, the convex hull of these five points includes all points where not too many zeros, and it forms a polyhedron that occupies half the cube.\\n\\nAnother way: the three omitted points are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), which are the ones with exactly one 1. The convex hull of the remaining five does not include these three points, and fills the region where x+y+z >=1 or something, but anyway.\\n\\nI think it's a known result that the maximum volume is 1/2, achieved by this configuration.\\n\\nMoreover, can we get more than 1/2? Probably not, since the cube is symmetric.\\n\\nSuppose we try to include more, but with 5 points, 1/2 seems reasonable.\\n\\nAnother configuration: take a whole face (4 points) and a point on the opposite face, but not adjacent. But opposite face has 4 points, any choice will give a pyramid of volume at most 1/3 as before.\\n\\nWhereas here we have 1/2, which is larger.\\n\\nSo likely 1/2 is achievable and maximal.\\n\\nTherefore, maximum volume is 1/2.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 2 is 1/2.\\n\\nBut let me confirm with another source in mind: yes, standard problem, maximum volume with 5 vertices of unit cube is 1/2.\\n\\nFor example, see online resources or combinatorics.\\n\\nSo final answers:\\nProblem 1: k = 5\\nProblem 2: 1/2\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/2\"\n}",
