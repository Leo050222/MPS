Then $f(x) = f(y) = f(z)$.\\n\\nNote: The function $f(t)$ is not one-to-one. For a given value $k$, solving $t - \\\\frac{1}{t} = k$ gives:\\n\\n$$\\nt^2 - kt - 1 = 0 \\\\Rightarrow t = \\\\frac{k \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{k^2 + 4}}{2}\\n$$\\n\\nSo for each $k$, there are two solutions, say $a$ and $b$, such that $f(a) = f(b) = k$, and in fact, if $a$ is a solution, then $b = -\\\\frac{1}{a}$ is the other (since roots multiply to $-1$).\\n\\nThus, $f(t_1) = f(t_2)$ implies either $t_1 = t_2$ or $t_1 = -\\\\frac{1}{t_2}$.\\n\\nTherefore, for $x, y, z$, since $f(x) = f(y) = f(z)$, each pair must either be equal or negative reciprocals.\\n\\nNow, we are told to consider the solution where **exactly two** of the variables are equal.\\n\\nLet us suppose without loss of generality that $x = y$, and $x \\\\ne z$, but $f(x) = f(z)$, so $z = -\\\\frac{1}{x}$.\\n\\nSo assume:\\n\\n- $x = y$\\n- $z = -\\\\frac{1}{x}$\\n\\nNow plug into one of the original equations. Use the first one:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = 3\\n\\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{x} + x + \\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) = 3\\n\\\\Rightarrow x = 3\\n$$\\n\\nSo $x = 3$, $y = 3$, $z = -\\\\frac{1}{3}$\\n\\nCheck whether all three expressions equal 3.\\n\\n1. $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{3} + 3 - \\\\frac{1}{3} = 3$ ✅\\n2. $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = 3 + \\\\frac{1}{3} - \\\\frac{1}{3} = 3$ ✅\\n3. $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 3 + 3 + \\\\frac{1}{-1/3} = 6 - 3 = 3$ ✅\\n\\nPerfect. So this is a valid solution with $x = y = 3$, $z = -\\\\frac{1}{3}$, and exactly two variables equal.\\n\\nNow, the problem says: \\\"find $k = z - 2$, where $z$ is the common value taken by the two equal variables in the solution where exactly two of the variables are equal.\\\"\\n\\nWait! It says: \\\"$z$ is the common value taken by the two equal variables\\\" — but in our case, the two equal variables are $x$ and $y$, both equal to 3. So the common value is 3, not $z = -1/3$. So the wording is tricky.\\n\\nLet me read again:\\n\\n\\\"find $k = z - 2$, where $z$ is the common value taken by the two equal variables...\\\"\\n\\nWait — this is confusing. It uses $z$ as both a variable and as a placeholder? That can't be.\\n\\nWait — likely a typo or abuse of notation. Let's read carefully:\\n\\n\\\"where $z$ is the common value taken by the two equal variables in the solution...\\\"\\n\\nBut $z$ is already used as a variable. This suggests that here $z$ is being reused as a new variable name — which is bad style.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps it means: let $w$ be the common value of the two equal variables, then compute $k = w - 2$?\\n\\nBut it says: \\\"find $k = z - 2$, where $z$ is the common value...\\\"\\n\\nThis must mean: redefine $z$ temporarily as the common value — i.e., use $z$ to denote that value.\\n\\nBut in our solution, the two equal variables are $x$ and $y$, both equal to 3. So the common value is 3.\\n\\nSo $k = 3 - 2 = 1$?\\n\\nBut wait — could there be another solution where a different pair is equal?\\n\\nLet’s check symmetry.\\n\\nSuppose instead $x = z$, and $y$ different.\\n\\nThen $f(x) = f(y) = f(z)$, so $f(x) = f(y)$, and since $x = z$, we need $f(y) = f(x)$, so $y = x$ or $y = -1/x$.\\n\\nIf $y = x$, then all three equal — but we want exactly two equal, so discard.\\n\\nSo $y = -1/x$.\\n\\nNow use the equations.\\n\\nLet $x = z$, $y = -1/x$\\n\\nUse first equation:\\n\\n$\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{x} - \\\\frac{1}{x} + x = x = 3$\\n\\nSo $x = 3$, $z = 3$, $y = -1/3$\\n\\nCheck second expression: $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = 3 + (-3) + 3 = 3$ ✅\\nThird: $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 3 - 1/3 + 1/3 = 3$ ✅\\n\\nValid. Again, two variables ($x$ and $z$) equal to 3, common value 3.\\n\\nSimilarly, if $y = z$, $x = -1/y$, then similar calculation:\\n\\nFrom third equation: $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = x + y + \\\\frac{1}{y} = 3$\\nBut $x = -1/y$, so:\\n\\n$-\\\\frac{1}{y} + y + \\\\frac{1}{y} = y = 3$\\n\\nSo $y = 3$, $z = 3$, $x = -1/3$\\n\\nAgain, common value is 3.\\n\\nSo in all cases where exactly two variables are equal, the common value is 3.\\n\\nHence, “$z$” in the question refers to this common value, so $k = z - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1$.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 1 is 1.\\n\\nBut wait — are there other solutions where two variables are equal?\\n\\nSuppose two variables are equal and also satisfy $t = -1/t$, i.e., $t^2 = -1$, impossible for real numbers. So no.\\n\\nOr could two variables be equal and the third also satisfy $f(t) = f(x)$ but not be $-1/x$? Only if it equals $x$, so all three equal.\\n\\nLet’s check the case where all three are equal.\\n\\nSuppose $x = y = z$\\n\\nThen from $\\\\frac{1}{x} + x + x = 3$\\n$\\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{x} + 2x = 3$\\nMultiply by $x$: $1 + 2x^2 = 3x$\\n$2x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0$\\n$(2x - 1)(x - 1) = 0$\\nSo $x = 1$ or $x = 1/2$\\n\\nCheck $x = y = z = 1$:\\n$\\\\frac{1}{1} + 1 + 1 = 3$ ✅\\nSimilarly for others — yes.\\n\\n$x = y = z = 1/2$:\\n$\\\\frac{1}{1/2} + 1/2 + 1/2 = 2 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 3$ ✅\\n\\nSo there are symmetric solutions too, but they have all three equal, so not considered here.\\n\\nBut in the exactly two equal case, we only found solutions where two are 3, one is -1/3.\\n\\nIs there a solution where two are equal to something else?\\n\\nSuppose $x = y$, and $z$ such that $f(z) = f(x)$, so $z = x$ or $z = -1/x$.\\n\\nIf $z = x$, then all equal — already considered.\\n\\nSo only possibility is $z = -1/x$, which we did.\\n\\nAnd we got $x = 3$ necessarily from the equation.\\n\\nIn our derivation, when $x = y$, $z = -1/x$, then:\\n\\nFrom first equation: $\\\\frac{1}{x} + x - \\\\frac{1}{x} = x = 3$\\nSo $x = 3$ forced.\\n\\nSimilarly in other pairings.\\n\\nSo only one such solution up to permutation.\\n\\nThus, in all such solutions, the common value of the two equal variables is 3.\\n\\nHence $k = 3 - 2 = 1$.\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 1: 1\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe are given three regular polygons:\\n\\n- $ICAO$\\n- $VENTI$\\n- $ALBEDO$\\n\\nWith points labeled, and given that $IN = 1$, find the number of possible values of $ON$.\\n\\nFirst, analyze the names to determine the number of sides:\\n\\n- $ICAO$: letters I, C, A, O → 4 letters → square? Regular quadrilateral.\\n- $VENTI$: V, E, N, T, I → 5 letters → regular pentagon.\\n- $ALBEDO$: A, L, B, E, D, O → 6 letters → regular hexagon.\\n\\nAll are regular polygons, lying on a plane.\\n\\nThe vertices are labeled with these letters, in order, presumably cyclically.\\n\\nWe are told $IN = 1$, and asked to compute the number of possible values of $ON$.\\n\\nSo points $I$, $N$, $O$ appear in multiple polygons.\\n\\nLet’s see which polygons contain which points:\\n\\n- $ICAO$: has I, C, A, O\\n- $VENTI$: has V, E, N, T, I → contains I and N\\n- $ALBEDO$: has A, L, B, E, D, O → contains A and O\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n- $I$ appears in $ICAO$ and $VENTI$\\n- $N$ appears in $VENTI$\\n- $O$ appears in $ICAO$ and $ALBEDO$\\n\\nAlso, $A$ appears in $ICAO$ and $ALBEDO$\\n$E$ appears in $VENTI$ and $ALBEDO$\\n\\nSo the polygons share some vertices.\\n\\nPossibly, they are joined at shared vertices.\\n\\nWe are to consider configurations where these three regular polygons are placed on the plane, sharing the labeled vertices consistently.\\n\\nGiven that $IN = 1$, find number of possible values of $ON$.\\n\\nSince the polygons are regular, their shapes are fixed up to size and position, but sizes may vary? Or are they inscribed in same circle? Not specified.\\n\\nBut labels are shared, so likely the vertices are identified by labels — i.e., point labeled 'A' is the same point in both $ICAO$ and $ALBEDO$, etc.\\n\\nSo we assume that whenever a letter appears in more than one polygon, it refers to the same point in the plane.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n- Point A is vertex of both $ICAO$ (square) and $ALBEDO$ (hexagon)\\n- Point E is vertex of $VENTI$ (pentagon) and $ALBEDO$ (hexagon)\\n- Point I is vertex of $ICAO$ (square) and $VENTI$ (pentagon)\\n- Point O is vertex of $ICAO$ (square) and $ALBEDO$ (hexagon)\\n- Point V, T, C, L, B, D are unique to their polygons\\n\\nSo the three polygons are connected via shared vertices: I, A, O, E are shared.\\n\\nSpecifically:\\n\\n- Square $ICAO$: vertices I, C, A, O (in order?)\\n- Pentagon $VENTI$: V, E, N, T, I (so closes back to I)\\n- Hexagon $ALBEDO$: A, L, B, E, D, O (closes to O)\\n\\nAssuming the labels are in cyclic order around each polygon.\\n\\nSo we can reconstruct the configuration based on relative positions.\\n\\nWe are given distance $IN = 1$, and want possible values of $ON$.\\n\\nPoints I and N are both in pentagon $VENTI$, which is regular.\\n\\nIn a regular pentagon with side length $s$, the diagonal length is $s\\\\phi$, where $\\\\phi = \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\\n\\nBut what is the distance between I and N?\\n\\nLook at $VENTI$: vertices in order: V, E, N, T, I\\n\\nSo sequence: V → E → N → T → I → V\\n\\nSo from N to I: N → T → I, so two edges away.\\n\\nSo $NI$ is a diagonal of the pentagon, not a side.\\n\\nAdjacent vertices: V-E, E-N, N-T, T-I, I-V\\n\\nSo I is adjacent to T and V\\nN is adjacent to E and T\\n\\nSo I and N are both adjacent to T, so angle at T.\\n\\nDistance $IN$: vertices I and N are separated by one vertex (T), so $IN$ is a diagonal.\\n\\nIn a regular pentagon, each diagonal has length $s \\\\cdot \\\\phi$, where $s$ is side length, $\\\\phi = \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\\n\\nSo in $VENTI$, let side length be $s_p$. Then $IN = s_p \\\\cdot \\\\phi = s_p \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\\n\\nBut we are told $IN = 1$, so:\\n\\n$$\\ns_p \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1 \\\\Rightarrow s_p = \\\\frac{2}{1+\\\\sqrt{5}} = \\\\frac{2(\\\\sqrt{5}-1)}{(1+\\\\sqrt{5})(\\\\sqrt{5}-1)} = \\\\frac{2(\\\\sqrt{5}-1)}{5 - 1} = \\\\frac{2(\\\\sqrt{5}-1)}{4} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\\n$$\\n\\nSo the pentagon has fixed size.\\n\\nNow, we need to find distance $ON$, where $O$ is in the square and hexagon.\\n\\nBut the square $ICAO$ and hexagon $ALBEDO$ are connected through shared points.\\n\\nShared points:\\n\\n- I: common to square and pentagon\\n- A: common to square and hexagon\\n- O: common to square and hexagon\\n- E: common to pentagon and hexagon\\n\\nSo all three polygons are interconnected:\\n\\n- Square shares I with pentagon, A and O with hexagon\\n- Hexagon shares E with pentagon\\n\\nSo the entire figure is connected.\\n\\nBut the key is that the shapes are rigid, but can be rotated around shared vertices.\\n\\nFor example, the square $ICAO$ has fixed shape, but its orientation relative to the pentagon can vary, because although they share point I, the angle between them is not fixed — unless constrained by other shared points.\\n\\nBut do they share more than one point?\\n\\nSquare and pentagon share only point I.\\n\\nSimilarly, pentagon and hexagon share only point E.\\n\\nSquare and hexagon share two points: A and O.\\n\\nAh! Important: $ICAO$ and $ALBEDO$ share both A and O.\\n\\nSo two common vertices.\\n\\nIn a regular polygon, two vertices determine an edge or a diagonal.\\n\\nIn square $ICAO$, vertices: I, C, A, O. Assuming cyclic order.\\n\\nPossible orders: could be I-C-A-O-I, so edges IC, CA, AO, OI.\\nThen A and O are adjacent.\\n\\nSimilarly, in hexagon $ALBEDO$: A, L, B, E, D, O. If cyclic order, then A to L to B to E to D to O to A.\\nSo A and O are adjacent if O follows A, but here it ends with O, then back to A, so if order is A-L-B-E-D-O-A, then O is adjacent to D and A. So yes, A and O are adjacent in the hexagon as well.\\n\\nSo in both polygons, A and O are adjacent vertices.\\n\\nTherefore, the edge $AO$ is common to both the square and the hexagon.\\n\\nSince both are regular, and share an edge, their relative position is fixed — they are rigidly attached along edge $AO$.\\n\\nSo the square and hexagon are glued together along edge $AO$.\\n\\nNow, the pentagon $VENTI$ shares:\\n\\n- Vertex I with the square\\n- Vertex E with the hexagon\\n\\nSo pentagon is connected to the square-hexagon composite at two points: I and E.\\n\\nBut I is a vertex of the square, E is a vertex of the hexagon.\\n\\nNow, the distance between I and E is determined by the composite of square and hexagon.\\n\\nBut the pentagon has fixed size (since $IN=1$ determines its scale), and it must have vertices I and E at a certain distance apart.\\n\\nIn the pentagon $VENTI$, what is the distance between I and E?\\n\\nVertices: V, E, N, T, I\\nOrder: E → N → T → I, so E to I is three edges apart.\\n\\nNumber of steps: E to N (1), N to T (2), T to I (3). So separated by two vertices.\\n\\nIn a regular pentagon, vertices separated by two edges are connected by a diagonal — same as any non-adjacent pair.\\n\\nIn a regular pentagon, all diagonals are equal.\\n\\nTotal vertices: 5. Each vertex connects to two others by edges, and to two by diagonals.\\n\\nDistance from E to I: path E-N-T-I is three edges, but direct distance is a diagonal.\\n\\nThe chord spanning 2 edges (i.e., skipping one vertex) has length $s_p \\\\phi$, same as before.\\n\\nIn a regular pentagon, the diagonal length (spanning two sides) is $s_p \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2} = s_p \\\\phi$.\\n\\nNow, the angular separation: each central angle is $72^\\\\circ$. From E to I: going E→N→T→I is 3 steps × 72° = 216°, or the short way is 144° (two steps: E→V→I or E→D→I? Wait, neighbors of E are V and N? Order: ...I, V, E, N, T, I...\\nSo sequence: I - V - E - N - T - I\\nSo E is between V and N.\\nI is between T and V.\\nSo from E to I: E-V-I: two edges, or E-N-T-I: three edges.\\nSo shortest path is two edges: E to V to I.\\nSo they are separated by one vertex (V), so the chord EI skips one vertex, so it's a diagonal, length $s_p \\\\phi$.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo in the pentagon, $EI = s_p \\\\phi$\\n\\nBut $s_p \\\\phi = 1$, because earlier we had $IN = s_p \\\\phi = 1$\\n\\nIndeed, $IN$ was also a diagonal, same length.\\n\\nSo $EI = 1$ as well? No:\\n\\n$IN = s_p \\\\phi = 1$, and $EI$ is also a diagonal, so yes, $EI = s_p \\\\phi = 1$\\n\\nSo in the pentagon, distance between E and I must be 1.\\n\\nBut in the composite figure, E and I are fixed points once the square and hexagon are glued.\\n\\nSo the distance between I (on square) and E (on hexagon) must be exactly 1 for the pentagon to fit.\\n\\nBut depending on how the square and hexagon are glued, the distance $IE$ may vary?\\n\\nBut they are glued along AO, and both are regular, so the relative position is fixed except for reflection.\\n\\nLet’s compute the distance between I and E in the square-hexagon assembly.\\n\\nSet coordinates.\\n\\nPlace edge $AO$ on the plane.\\n\\nSet point A at origin $(0,0)$, point O at $(s,0)$, where $s$ is the side length of both square and hexagon? But they may have different side lengths!\\n\\nWait — important: the square $ICAO$ and hexagon $ALBEDO$ share edge $AO$, so the length of $AO$ must be the same in both polygons.\\n\\nTherefore, the side length of the square equals the side length of the hexagon.\\n\\nLet $s$ be the common side length of square and hexagon.\\n\\nNow, in square $ICAO$, with vertices in order: I, C, A, O.\\n\\nWe have A and O. Where are I and C?\\n\\nDepending on the orientation.\\n\\nFrom A to O is one edge.\\n\\nIn the square, next vertex from O could be I or C? The sequence is I-C-A-O, so after O comes I? Or before I?\\n\\nLabel order: I, C, A, O — so likely cyclic order: I → C → A → O → I\\n\\nSo edges: I-C, C-A, A-O, O-I\\n\\nSo O is adjacent to A and I.\\nA is adjacent to C and O.\\n\\nSo from A to O is an edge, and from O to I is the next edge.\\n\\nIn a square, each internal angle is $90^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nSo at vertex O, the turn from A-O to O-I is $90^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nSimilarly, direction depends on orientation.\\n\\nSimilarly for hexagon: $ALBEDO$: A → L → B → E → D → O → A\\nSo edges: A-L, L-B, B-E, E-D, D-O, O-A\\nSo O is adjacent to D and A.\\nA is adjacent to O and L.\\n\\nAt vertex A, the turn from O-A to A-L is $120^\\\\circ$ for a regular hexagon (internal angle).\\n\\nBut we need to place them.\\n\\nSet coordinate system:\\n\\nPlace point A at $(0,0)$, point O at $(s, 0)$\\n\\nNow, square $ICAO$: from A to O is vector $(s,0)$\\n\\nNow, from O to I: in the square, since it's regular, and assuming counter-clockwise order: I → C → A → O → I\\n\\nFrom A to O is eastward.\\nThen from O to I: should be perpendicular. Since it's a square, turning left (ccw) would go north, turning right (cw) would go south.\\n\\nSo two possibilities:\\n\\nCase 1: counter-clockwise: then from O, go upward to I.\\nVector from A to O: $(s,0)$\\nThen vector from O to I: rotate previous edge by $90^\\\\circ$ ccw: rotate $(s,0)$ by $90^\\\\circ$ ccw is $(0,s)$\\nBut the edge is from O to I, and the incoming edge to O is from A to O: $(s,0)$\\nFor a polygon traversed ccw, the turn at O is left by $90^\\\\circ$, so the outgoing edge O to I is obtained by rotating incoming edge A to O by $90^\\\\circ$ ccw.\\nIncoming vector to O is $\\\\vec{AO} = (s,0)$\\nRotate $90^\\\\circ$ ccw: $(0,s)$, so I is at $O + (0,s) = (s,0) + (0,s) = (s,s)$\\n\\nSimilarly, if clockwise, rotate $90^\\\\circ$ cw: $(0,-s)$, so I is at $(s, -s)$\\n\\nNow, hexagon $ALBEDO$: regular, so internal angles $120^\\\\circ$.\\nTraversed in order A → L → B → E → D → O → A\\nAssume counter-clockwise for now.\\nAt vertex A: incoming from O to A: vector $\\\\vec{OA} = (-s, 0)$\\nFor ccw traversal, turn left by $120^\\\\circ$? The external angle is $60^\\\\circ$, but easier to think in terms of direction.\\nFrom A, previous vertex is O, next is L.\\nVector from O to A: $(-s, 0)$\\nThen from A to L: rotate the incoming direction by the external angle.\\nFor regular polygon, the direction changes by external angle $360^\\\\circ/n$ at each vertex.\\nFor hexagon, $n=6$, external angle $60^\\\\circ$.\\nFor ccw traversal, turn left $60^\\\\circ$.\\nSo incoming direction to A is from O to A: direction $180^\\\\circ$ (west)\\nAfter turning left $60^\\\\circ$, new direction is $180^\\\\circ - 60^\\\\circ = 120^\\\\circ$? Angles in standard position.\\nIncoming vector: $(-s, 0)$, direction $180^\\\\circ$\\nTurn left (ccw) by $60^\\\\circ$, so new direction: $180^\\\\circ + 60^\\\\circ = 240^\\\\circ$? No.\\nWhen traversing, the direction you are facing.\\nComing into A from O, you are moving west (direction $180^\\\\circ$)\\nAt A, for ccw polygon, you turn left (ccw) by external angle $60^\\\\circ$, so new direction is $180^\\\\circ + 60^\\\\circ = 240^\\\\circ$\\nSo vector from A to L: length $s$, direction $240^\\\\circ$, so components: $s \\\\cos 240^\\\\circ = s (-1/2)$, $s \\\\sin 240^\\\\circ = s (-\\\\sqrt{3}/2)$\\nSo L is at $A + (-s/2, -s\\\\sqrt{3}/2) = (0,0) + (-s/2, -s\\\\sqrt{3}/2) = (-s/2, -s\\\\sqrt{3}/2)$\\nBut we need point E.\\nFrom A to L to B to E.\\nEach step turns $60^\\\\circ$ left.\\nDirection from A to L: $240^\\\\circ$\\nThen from L to B: turn left $60^\\\\circ$, so direction $240^\\\\circ + 60^\\\\circ = 300^\\\\circ$\\nVector: $s \\\\cos 300^\\\\circ = s (1/2)$, $s \\\\sin 300^\\\\circ = s (-\\\\sqrt{3}/2)$\\nSo B is at L + (s/2, -s√3/2) = (-s/2, -s√3/2) + (s/2, -s√3/2) = (0, -s√3)\\nThen from B to E: turn left $60^\\\\circ$, direction $300^\\\\circ + 60^\\\\circ = 360^\\\\circ = 0^\\\\circ$\\nVector: $s (1, 0)$\\nSo E is at B + (s, 0) = (0, -s√3) + (s, 0) = (s, -s√3)\\n\\nNow, if the hexagon is clockwise, then turns are right by $60^\\\\circ$.\\nIncoming to A from O: direction $180^\\\\circ$\\nTurn right (cw) $60^\\\\circ$, new direction $180^\\\\circ -

E| = s(\\\\sqrt{3} - 1) = 1$ ⇒ $s = 1/(\\\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\\n\\nNow, for each such configuration, we can compute $ON$, where $O$ is at $(s,0)$, $N$ is a vertex of the pentagon.\\n\\nThe pentagon $VENTI$ has fixed size and shape, with $|EI|=1$, $|IN|=1$, and it's regular.\\n\\nBut once $E$ and $I$ are fixed, the position of $N$ is not unique — because the pentagon can be on either side of the line $EI$.\\n\\nFor two fixed points $E$ and $I$ at distance 1, and $N$ such that $EN$ and $IN$ are edges of a regular pentagon.\\n\\nIn pentagon $VENTI$, order: V, E, N, T, I\\nSo from E to N is an edge, from N to T to I, so $N$ is adjacent to $E$ and $T$, and $I$ is two edges away.\\n\\nDistance $EN = s_p$, the side length.\\nBut earlier, diagonal $IN = s_p \\\\phi = 1$, so $s_p = 1 / \\\\phi = \\\\phi - 1 = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$\\nSince $\\\\phi = \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, so $1/\\\\phi = \\\\frac{2}{1+\\\\sqrt{5}} = \\\\frac{2(\\\\sqrt{5}-1)}{4} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$\\n\\nSimilarly, $EN = s_p = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$\\n\\nNow, in triangle $EIN$, we have:\\n\\n- $EI = 1$ (diagonal)\\n- $IN = 1$ (diagonal)\\n- $EN = s_p = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$\\n\\nIs that right? $EI$ and $IN$ are both diagonals, so length 1, $EN$ is a side, length $s_p < 1$.\\n\\nBut in the pentagon, are $E$, $I$, $N$ forming a triangle with two diagonals and a side?\\n\\nFrom E to N: adjacent, so edge.\\nN to I: not adjacent; N to T to I, so separated by one vertex, so diagonal.\\nE to I: separated by V, so diagonal.\\nYes.\\n\\nSo triangle $EIN$ has sides $EN = s_p$, $NI = s_p \\\\phi = 1$, $EI = s_p \\\\phi = 1$\\nSince $s_p \\\\phi = 1$, and $s_p = 1/\\\\phi$, so $EN = 1/\\\\phi$, $NI = 1$, $EI = 1$\\n\\nSo isosceles triangle with $EI = IN = 1$, $EN = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \\\\approx \\\\frac{2.236 - 1}{2} = 0.618$\\n\\nFor fixed $E$ and $I$, the point $N$ lies at intersection of:\\n\\n- Circle centered at $E$ with radius $EN = s_p = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$\\n- Circle centered at $I$ with radius $IN = 1$\\n\\nSince $EI = 1$, and $IN = 1$, $EN = s_p < 1$, and $s_p < EI$, etc.\\n\\nThe two circles:\\n\\n- Center $E$, radius $r_E = s_p$\\n- Center $I$, radius $r_I = 1$\\n- Distance between centers $d = EI = 1$\\n\\nCheck if they intersect: $|r_I - r_E| = |1 - s_p|$, $r_I + r_E = 1 + s_p$\\n$d = 1$\\nNow $|1 - s_p| = 1 - s_p$ since $s_p < 1$\\n$1 - s_p ≈ 1 - 0.618 = 0.382$\\n$1 + s_p ≈ 1.618$\\n$d = 1$, which is between $0.382$ and $1.618$, so two intersection points.\\n\\nThus, for each fixed $E$ and $I$, there are two possible positions for $N$, symmetric with respect to the line $EI$.\\n\\nNow, we need to compute $ON$ for each configuration.\\n\\nBut $O$ is fixed once the square-hexagon is fixed, and $N$ depends on the pentagon's placement.\\n\\nMoreover, the pentagon must be consistently oriented, but since we only care about distance $ON$, and the two choices are symmetric, they might give same distance or different.\\n\\nBut $O$ may not be on the line $EI$, so the two positions of $N$ may give different distances to $O$.\\n\\nHowever, in our setup, we have different configurations based on the square-hexagon orientation, and for each, two choices for the pentagon's side.\\n\\nBut recall that we have two types of square-hexagon assemblies:\\n\\nType A: $|I - E| = s(1+\\\\sqrt{3}) = 1$ ⇒ $s = 1/(1+\\\\sqrt{3})$\\nType B: $|I - E| = s(\\\\sqrt{3} - 1) = 1$ ⇒ $s = 1/(\\\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\\n\\nNote that $1/(\\\\sqrt{3} - 1) = (\\\\sqrt{3} + 1)/2$ after rationalizing, and $1/(1+\\\\sqrt{3}) = (\\\\sqrt{3} - 1)/2$\\n\\nNow, for each type, we have a specific $s$, and thus specific positions for $I$, $E$, $O$.\\n\\nThen for each such fixed $E$ and $I$, there are two possible $N$'s.\\n\\nThen compute $ON$ for each.\\n\\nBut the problem asks for the number of possible values of $ON$, so we need to see how many distinct distances arise.\\n\\nFirst, note that Type A and Type B have different $s$, so different geometries.\\n\\nConsider Type A: $s = \\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\sqrt{3}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}-1}{2}$ (after rationalizing)\\n\\nIn this type, from earlier, $|I - E| = s(1+\\\\sqrt{3}) = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}-1}{2} \\\\cdot (1+\\\\sqrt{3}) = \\\\frac{(\\\\sqrt{3}-1)(1+\\\\sqrt{3})}{2} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\cdot1 + 3 -1 -\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\\\frac{2}{2} = 1$, good.\\n\\nNow, in this configuration, what are coordinates?\\n\\nTake, for example, Case 1: square ccw, hexagon ccw.\\nThen:\\n- A: (0,0)\\n- O: (s, 0)\\n- I: (s, s)\\n- E: (s, -s\\\\sqrt{3})\\n\\nSo both I and E have x-coordinate s, y-coordinates s and -s√3.\\nSo line $IE$ is vertical, x = s.\\n\\nSimilarly, in Case 4: square cw, hexagon cw: I at (s,-s), E at (s, s√3), so again both at x=s, y=-s and y=s√3, so still vertical line x=s.\\n\\nSo in Type A, $IE$ is vertical.\\n\\nNow, $O$ is at (s, 0), which is on the same line x=s.\\n\\nSo $O$, $I$, $E$ are colinear, on the line x=s.\\n\\nSpecifically, in Case 1: E at (s, -s√3), O at (s,0), I at (s,s)\\nSo y-coordinates: E: -s√3 ≈ -1.732s, O: 0, I: s ≈1s\\nSo order on line: E, O, I, since -1.732s < 0 < s\\n\\nNow, we place $N$ such that $|EN| = s_p$, $|IN| = 1$\\n\\nWith $E$ and $I$ fixed, distance $EI=1$\\n\\nThe two possible $N$'s are symmetric with respect to the line $IE$, which is vertical.\\n\\nSince $O$ is on this line, the two possible $N$'s are symmetric wiper respect to the line $x=s$, so their distances to $O$ are equal.\\n\\nBecause $O$ is on the axis of symmetry.\\n\\nTherefore, for each Type A configuration, the two choices of $N$ give the same $ON$.\\n\\nNow, compute $ON$.\\n\\nSet coordinates.\\n\\nLet $s = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}-1}{2}$\\n\\nBut we can compute without numerical values.\\n\\nPoints:\\n- $E: (s, -s\\\\sqrt{3})$\\n- $I: (s, s)$\\n- $O: (s, 0)$\\n\\nDistance $EI = |s - (-s\\\\sqrt{3})| = s(1 + \\\\sqrt{3}) = 1$, as set.\\n\\nNow, $N$ is at distance $s_p = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$ from $E$, and distance 1 from $I$.\\n\\nLet $N = (x,y)$\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$(x - s)^2 + (y + s\\\\sqrt{3})^2 = s_p^2$  \\n$(x - s)^2 + (y - s)^2 = 1^2 = 1$\\n\\nSubtract the two equations:\\n\\nEq2 - Eq1:\\n\\n$[(x-s)^2 + (y-s)^2] - [(x-s)^2 + (y + s\\\\sqrt{3})^2] = 1 - s_p^2$\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n$(y-s)^2 - (y + s\\\\sqrt{3})^2 = 1 - s_p^2$\\n\\nExpand:\\n\\n$(y^2 - 2sy + s^2) - (y^2 + 2y s\\\\sqrt{3} + 3s^2) = 1 - s_p^2$\\n\\n$y^2 - 2sy + s^2 - y^2 - 2y s\\\\sqrt{3} - 3s^2 = 1 - s_p^2$\\n\\n$-2sy - 2y s\\\\sqrt{3} - 2s^2 = 1 - s_p^2$\\n\\nFactor y:\\n\\n$-2s y (1 + \\\\sqrt{3}) - 2s^2 = 1 - s_p^2$\\n\\nNow, recall that $s(1 + \\\\sqrt{3}) = 1$, so $1 + \\\\sqrt{3} = 1/s$\\n\\nThus:\\n\\n$-2s y \\\\cdot (1/s) - 2s^2 = 1 - s_p^2$\\n\\n$-2y - 2s^2 = 1 - s_p^2$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$-2y = 1 - s_p^2 + 2s^2$\\n\\n$y = -\\\\frac{1}{2} (1 - s_p^2 + 2s^2)$\\n\\nNow, $s_p = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$, so $s_p^2 = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{5 - 2\\\\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} = \\\\frac{6 - 2\\\\sqrt{5}}{4} = \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\\n\\n$s = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}-1}{2}$, so $s^2 = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}-1}{2}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{3 - 2\\\\sqrt{3} + 1}{4} = \\\\frac{4 - 2\\\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\\\frac{2 - \\\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\\n\\nNow plug in:\\n\\n$y = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{5}}{2} + 2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{2 - \\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\right) = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{5}}{2} + (2 - \\\\sqrt{3}) \\\\right)$\\n\\nCompute inside:\\n\\nFirst, $1 + 2 - \\\\sqrt{3} = 3 - \\\\sqrt{3}$\\nMinus $\\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\\n\\nSo $3 - \\\\sqrt{3} - \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\\\frac{6 - 2\\\\sqrt{3} - 3 + \\\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\\\frac{3 - 2\\\\sqrt{3} + \\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\\n\\nThen $y = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{3 - 2\\\\sqrt{3} + \\\\sqrt{5}}{2} = -\\\\frac{3 - 2\\\\sqrt{3} + \\\\sqrt{5}}{4}$\\n\\nNow, from the second equation: $(x - s)^2 + (y - s)^2 = 1$\\n\\nWe can solve for $(x - s)^2$, but since we want distance to $O(s,0)$, which is $\\\\sqrt{(x-s)^2 + (y-0)^2} = \\\\sqrt{(x-s)^2 + y^2}$\\n\\nFrom the equation: $(x-s)^2 = 1 - (y - s)^2$\\n\\nSo $ON^2 = (x-s)^2 + y^2 = [1 - (y - s)^2] + y^2 = 1 - (y^2 - 2ys + s^2) + y^2 = 1 - y^2 + 2ys - s^2 + y^2 = 1 + 2ys - s^2$\\n\\nSo $ON^2 = 1 + 2y s - s^2$\\n\\nNow plug in $y$ and $s$.\\n\\nBut this is messy, and we may not need the value, since we just need the number of possible values.\\n\\nNote that in Type A, due to symmetry, both choices of $N$ give same $ON$, so one value per Type A configuration.\\n\\nBut all Type A configurations (cases 1 and 4) have the same relative geometry: $IE$ vertical, $O$ on it, same distances, so $ON$ will be the same.\\n\\nSimilarly for Type B.\\n\\nNow Type B: $|I - E| = s(\\\\sqrt{3} - 1) = 1$ ⇒ $s = 1/(\\\\sqrt{3} - 1) = (\\\\sqrt{3} + 1)/2$\\n\\nIn this case, for example Case 2: square ccw (I at (s,s)), hexagon cw (E at (s, s√3))\\nThen $I - E = (0, s - s\\\\sqrt{3}) = (0, s(1 - \\\\sqrt{3}))$, distance $|s(1 - \\\\sqrt{3})| = s(\\\\sqrt{3} - 1) = 1$\\n\\nCoordinates:\\n- A: (0,0)\\n- O: (s,0)\\n- I: (s,s)\\n- E: (s, s√3)\\n\\nSo again, both I and E have x=s, so $IE$ is vertical.\\n\\nO at (s,0)\\n\\ny-coordinates: I: s, E: s√3 ≈1.732s, O:0\\nSince s>0, E at y≈1.732s, I at y=s, so E above I, O at y=0 below.\\n\\nSo on line x=s, order: O (0), I (s), E (1.732s)\\n\\nAgain, $O$, $I$, $E$ colinear on vertical line.\\n\\nSimilarly for Case 3.\\n\\nSo in all cases, for both types, $O$, $I$, $E$ are colinear, and $IE$ is perpendicular to $AO$ (which is along x-axis).\\n\\nIn both types, the line $IE$ is vertical, and $O$ is on it.\\n\\nFor Type B, $s = (\\\\sqrt{3} + 1)/2$\\n\\nNow, place $N$: again, circles centered at $E$ and $I$ with radii $s_p$ and 1, distance $EI=1$.\\n\\nSame as before, two intersection points, symmetric w.r.t. the line $IE$ (vertical).\\n\\nSince $O$ is on this line, the two possible $N$'s are symmetric, so $ON$ is the same for both.\\n\\nTherefore, for each type, only one value of $ON$ (despite two choices for $N$).\\n\\nNow, are the $ON$ values different for Type A and Type B?\\n\\nProbably yes, since $s$ is different.\\n\\nSo potentially two different values of $ON$.\\n\\nBut is that all?\\n\\nWe assumed the polygons are convex and labeled in order, but perhaps reflections are already covered.\\n\\nIn our cases, we have two distinct configurations: Type A with smaller $s$, Type B with larger $s$.\\n\\nIn Type A: $s = (\\\\sqrt{3}-1)/2 ≈ (1.732-1)/2 = 0.366$\\nType B: $s = (\\\\sqrt{3}+1)/2 ≈ (1.732+1)/2 = 1.366$\\n\\nDifferent scales.\\n\\nNow, compute $ON$ for each.\\n\\nSince in both cases the setup is similar: $O$ at (s,0), $I$ and $E$ on x=s, distance $EI=1$, and we compute distance from $O$ to $N$, with $N$ determined by intersection.\\n\\nBut the relative position of $O$ with respect to $I$ and $E$ differs between types.\\n\\nIn Type A (e.g. Case 1): E at (s, -s√3), I at (s,s), O at (s,0)\\nSo vector from E to I: (0, s - (-s√3)) = (0, s(1+√3)) = (0,1) since s(1+√3)=1\\nSo E to I is (0,1)\\nO is at (s,0), E is at (s, -s√3), so vector E to O: (0, 0 - (-s√3)) = (0, s√3)\\nSince s(1+√3)=1, s = 1/(1+√3), so s√3 = √3/(1+√3) = √3(√3-1)/((1+√3)(√3-1)) better: s√3 = √3 / (1+√3) = √3(√3-1)/(3-1) = (3 - √3)/2 ?\\nRationalize: $\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{1+\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1-\\\\sqrt{3}}{1-\\\\sqrt{3}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}(1-\\\\sqrt{3})}{1-3} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3} - 3}{-2} = \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\\nBut perhaps keep in terms of known quantities.\\nSince E to I is vector (0,1), and E to O is (0, s√3)\\nBut s√3 = √3 * s, and s = 1/(1+√3), so s√3 = √3/(1+√3)\\nNumerically ≈ 1.732 / 2.732 ≈ 0.634\\nSimilarly, in Type B: s = (√3+1)/2 ≈ 1.366, E at (s, s√3) ≈ (1.366, 2.366), I at (s,s)≈(1.366,1.366), so E to I: (0,1.366 - 2.366)= (0,-1)? Distance |dy|= |s - s√3| = s|1-√3| = s(√3-1)=1, yes, so E to I is (0,-1) if E above, but in our coord, E at y=s√3≈2.366, I at y=s≈1.366, so E to I is down, (0, -1)\\nO at (s,0), so E to O: (0, 0 - s√3) = (0, -s√3)\\ns = (√3+1)/2, s√3 = √3(√3+1)/2 = (3 + √3)/2 ≈ (3+1.732)/2=2.366\\nSo E to O: (0, -2.366)\\n\\nTo compute $ON$, we can use the formula from earlier.\\n\\nGenerally, for fixed $E$ and $I$, distance $d=EI=1$, and $O$ on the line $EI$.\\n\\nLet me set a coordinate on the line.\\n\\nLet me set point $E$ at 0, $I$ at 1 on a number line (since $EI=1$).\\nLet $O$ be at position $p$ on this line.\\n\\nThen $N$ is at distance $r_E = s_p$ from $E$, distance $r_I = 1$ from $I$.\\n\\nThe two possible $N$'s are at equal distance from the line, but since $O$ is on the line, $ON$ depends on the perpendicular distance.\\n\\nThe distance from $E$ to $I$ is 1.\\n\\nThe line joining the two intersection points of the circles is perpendicular to $EI$ at some point.\\n\\nThe set of points $N$ such that $|EN| = a$, $|IN| = b$, with $|EI| = d$.\\n\\nThe distance from $E$ to the foot of perpendicular from $N$ to $EI$ can be found by law of cosines.\\n\\nIn triangle $EIN$, we have $EI=1$, $EN=s_p$, $IN=1$\\n\\nSo it's isosceles with $EI=IN=1$, $EN=s_p$\\n\\nLet me find the height from $N$ to $EI$.\\n\\nLet $M$ be the midpoint of $EI$? Not necessarily, since not isosceles that way.\\n$EI$ and $IN$ are equal, both 1, so isosceles with apex $I$? Sides from $I$: $IN=1$, $IE=1$, and base $EN=s_p$\\n\\nYes! Triangle $EIN$ has $IE = IN = 1$, $EN = s_p$\\n\\nSo isosceles with $IE = IN$, so apex $I$, base $EN$.\\n\\nTherefore, the height from $I$ to $EN$ can be found, but we need distance from $N$ to line $EI$.\\n\\nSince $IE = IN$, the triangle is isosceles with apex $I$, so the median from $I$ to $EN$ is also the altitude.\\n\\nBut we need the distance from $N$ to the line $EI$.\\n\\nConsider coordinates: place $E$ at (0,0), $I$ at (1,0)\\nThen $N$ such that $|EN| = s_p$, $|IN| = 1$\\nSo:\\n$x^2 + y^2 = s_p^2$\\n$(x-1)^2 + y^2 = 1$\\nSubtract: $(x-1)^2 - x^2 = 1 - s_p^2$\\n$x^2 - 2x + 1 - x^2 = 1 - s_p^2$\\n$-2x + 1 = 1 - s_p^2$\\n$-2x = - s_p^2$\\n$x = s_p^2 / 2$\\nThen from first equation: $y^2 = s_p^2 - x^2 = s_p^2 - (s_p^4 / 4)$\\nSo $y = \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{ s_p^2 - \\\\frac{s_p^4}{4} } = \\\\pm s_p \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{s_p^2}{4}}$\\n\\nNow, $s_p = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$, $s_p^2 = \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ as before.\\nBut we can leave symbolic.\\n\\nNow, $O$ is on the line $EI$, which is the x-axis in this coord, say at $(p, 0)$\\nThen $ON = \\\\sqrt{ (x - p)^2 + (y - 0)^2 } = \\\\sqrt{ (x - p)^2 + y^2 }$\\nBut $y^2 = s_p^2 - x^2$, and $x = s_p^2 / 2$\\nSo $ON^2 = (x - p)^2 + y^2 = (x - p)^2 + (s_p^2 - x^2) = x^2 - 2px + p^2 + s_p^2 - x^2 = -2px + p^2 + s_p^2$\\nSo $ON^2 = p^2 - 2p x + s_p^2$\\nWith $x = s_p^2 / 2$\\nSo $ON^2 = p^2 - 2p (s_p^2 / 2) + s_p^2 = p^2 - p s_p^2 + s_p^2$\\n\\nNow, $p$ is the position of $O$ on the line $EI$, with $E$ at 0, $I$ at 1.\\n\\nIn our configurations, $p$ depends on the type.\\n\\nIn Type A: for example, E at y= -s√3, I at y=s, O at y=0, and E to I is from y=-s√3 to y=s, difference s(1+√3)=1\\nSo the vector from E to I is +1 in y-direction.\\nSo parametrize: let t be parameter from E to I, t=0 at E, t=1 at I.\\nThen y-coordinate: from -s√3 to s, total change s(1+√3)=1\\nSo y(t) = -s√3 + t * 1\\nO is at y=0, so 0 = -s√3 + t * 1 ⇒ t = s√3\\nBut s = 1/(1+√3), so t = √3 / (1+√3) = as before, rationalize: $\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{1+\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\\\sqrt{3}-1} = \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{3}}{3 - 1} = \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\\nSo p = t = \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{3}}{2} ? No, p is the distance from E, but in our coord, the distance along the line is proportional, since it's straight.\\nIn our local coord, E at 0, I at 1, so p = distance from E to O divided by |EI|, but since |EI|=1, p = signed distance from E to O in the direction of I.\\nFrom above, the displacement from E to O is s√3 in the y-direction, and from E to I is 1 in y-direction, so the scalar projection is (s√3) / 1 = s√3\\nSince both in same direction.\\nSo p = s√3\\nWith s = 1/(1+√3), so p = √3 / (1+√3) = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{1+\\\\sqrt{3}}\\nAs above, = \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{3}}{2} ? Earlier calculation: $\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{1+\\\\sqrt{3}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}(\\\\sqrt{3}-1)}{(1+\\\\sqrt{3})(\\\\sqrt{3}-1)} = \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{3}}{3 - 1} = \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\\nYes.\\nNumerically ≈ (3-1.732)/2=1.268/2=0.634\\n\\nIn Type B: s = (√3+1)/2\\nE at (s, s√3), I at (s,s), so from E to I: dy = s - s√3 = s(1-√3) <0, magnitude |s(1-√3)| = s(√3-1)=1\\nSo vector from E to I is (0, -1) in our global coord, but magnitude 1 downward.\\nO at (s,0), E at (s, s√3), so vector E to O: (0, -s√3)\\nNow, the direction from E to I is (0,-1), so unit vector downward.\\nVector E to O is (0, -s√3), so component in direction of E to I: since both downward, the scalar is |E to O| / |E to I| in that direction, but since parallel, p = (length of E to O in dir of E to I) / |E to I|\\nLength of projection: since same direction, |E to O| / 1 * sign, but E to O is downward, E to I is downward, so p = |E to O| / |E to I| = (s√3) / 1 = s√3\\ns = (√3+1)/2, so p = √3 * (√3+1)/2 = (3 + √3)/2 ≈ (3+1.732)/2=4.732/2=2.366\\n\\nBut in our local coord, p should be between 0 and 1? No, p can be outside [0,1].\\nIn Type B, E at y=s√3≈2.366s? s≈1.366, s√3≈2.366, yes, I at y=s≈1.366, O at y=0, so O is below E, while I is also below E but less so.\\nFrom E to I is down to y=1.366, from E to O is down to y=0, so further.\\nSo in the line, with E at 0, I at 1 (since |EI|=1 downward), then O is further down, so p >1.\\nSpecifically, distance from E to O is s√3 ≈2.366, and |EI|=1, so if we set direction from E to I as positive, then p = - (distance) because it's in opposite direction? Let's define.\\nSet E at 0, I at 1 on the line, with the direction from E to I being positive.\\nIn Type B, from E to I is downward, distance 1.\\nFrom E to O is also downward, distance s√3 ≈2.366\\nSince same direction, p = distance from E to O in the positive direction = s√3\\nBut s√3 = √3 * (√3+1)/2 = (3 + √3)/2 ≈ 2.366\\nSo p = (3 + √3)/2\\n\\nNow, in Type A, p = s√3 = √3 / (1+√3) = (3 - √3)/2 ≈ (3-1.732)/2=1.268/2=0.634? Earlier I had /2, but (3-1.732)=1.268, divided by 2 is 0.634, yes.\\n\\nNow, we have $ON^2 = p^2 - p s_p^2 + s_p^2$\\nWith $s_p^2 = \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\\n\\nNow for Type A: p_A = \\\\frac{3 - \\\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\nFor Type B: p_B = \\\\frac{3 + \\\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\n\\nNow compute ON^2 for each.\\n\\nSince p_A ≠ p_B, and the expression is quadratic, likely ON^2 different, so ON different.\\n\\nMoreover, since p_A ≈0.634, p_B≈2.366, clearly different.\\n\\nNow, is there any other configuration?\\n\\nWe assumed the labeling order is consistent, but perhaps the polygons could be reflected, but we already considered both orientations for square and hexagon.\\n\\nAlso, in the pentagon, we have two choices for N, but as established, due to symmetry, they give same ON when O is on the symmetry axis, which it is.\\n\\nTherefore, only two possible values for ON.\\n\\nBut the problem asks for the number of possible values of ON, so answer should be 2.\\n\\nBut let me confirm if in both types we get valid configurations.\\n\\nIn Type A, s = (√3-1)/2 ≈0.366, positive, good.\\nIn Type B, s=(√3+1)/2≈1.366, good.\\n\\nAnd for each, we can place the pentagon.\\n\\nAlso, no other constraints violated.\\n\\nTherefore, two possible values.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 2 is 2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\"\n}",
