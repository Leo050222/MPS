Then $f(x) = f(y) = f(z)$.\\n\\nNow, solve $f(a) = k$: \\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{a} - a = k \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{1 - a^2}{a} = k \\\\Rightarrow 1 - a^2 = ka \\\\Rightarrow a^2 + ka - 1 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nSo each of $x, y, z$ satisfies a quadratic equation with parameter $k$, meaning each is a root of $t^2 + kt - 1 = 0$. This quadratic has at most two real roots. So $x, y, z$ can take at most two distinct values.\\n\\nBut since $f(x) = f(y) = f(z)$, they all have the same value of $\\\\frac{1}{a} - a$, so they are either equal or come in pairs such that $f(a) = f(b)$.\\n\\nNote: The function $f(a) = \\\\frac{1}{a} - a$ is not one-to-one. In fact, suppose $f(a) = f(b)$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{a} - a = \\\\frac{1}{b} - b \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{a} - \\\\frac{1}{b} = a - b \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{b - a}{ab} = a - b = -(b - a)\\n\\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{ab} = -1 \\\\Rightarrow ab = -1\\n$$\\n\\nSo $f(a) = f(b)$ if and only if $ab = -1$.\\n\\nTherefore, for any two variables, say $x$ and $y$, either $x = y$ or $xy = -1$.\\n\\nSame for other pairs.\\n\\nSo among $x, y, z$, each pair either equals or multiplies to $-1$.\\n\\nNow go back to the original equations.\\n\\nLet’s denote:\\n\\nFrom (1): $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = 3$\\nFrom (2): $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = 3$\\nFrom (3): $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 3$\\n\\nSubtract (1) from (2):\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left(x - \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) + \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{y} - y\\\\right) = 0\\n\\\\Rightarrow \\\\left(x - \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) = \\\\left(y - \\\\frac{1}{y}\\\\right)\\n\\\\Rightarrow -(\\\\frac{1}{x} - x) = -(\\\\frac{1}{y} - y) \\\\Rightarrow \\\\text{same as before}\\n$$\\n\\nNow let’s try to assume symmetry. Suppose $x = y = z$. Then each equation becomes:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{x} + x + x = 3 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{x} + 2x = 3\\n$$\\n\\nMultiply by $x$: $1 + 2x^2 = 3x \\\\Rightarrow 2x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0$\\n\\nSolve: $x = \\\\frac{3 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{9 - 8}}{4} = \\\\frac{3 \\\\pm 1}{4} \\\\Rightarrow x = 1, \\\\frac{1}{2}$\\n\\nCheck:\\n\\n- If $x = 1$: $\\\\frac{1}{1} + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$: works.\\n- If $x = \\\\frac{1}{2}$: $\\\\frac{1}{1/2} + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2} = 2 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 3$: also works.\\n\\nWait — no: the expression is $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z$, and if $x = y = z = \\\\frac{1}{2}$, then $\\\\frac{1}{x} = 2$, $y = z = 0.5$, so $2 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 3$: yes.\\n\\nBut now check second equation: $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = 0.5 + 2 + 0.5 = 3$: good.\\nThird: $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 0.5 + 0.5 + 2 = 3$: good.\\n\\nSo both $x = y = z = 1$ and $x = y = z = \\\\frac{1}{2}$ work?\\n\\nWait: if $x = y = z = \\\\frac{1}{2}$, then $\\\\frac{1}{x} = 2$, etc., and sum is $2 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 3$: correct.\\n\\nBut let's compute $x + y + z$:\\n- Case 1: $x = y = z = 1$: sum = 3\\n- Case 2: $x = y = z = \\\\frac{1}{2}$: sum = $\\\\frac{3}{2}$\\n\\nBut wait — are there more solutions where variables are not all equal?\\n\\nEarlier we found that if $f(a) = f(b)$, then $ab = -1$ or $a = b$.\\n\\nSo possibilities: some variables equal, others satisfy $ab = -1$.\\n\\nTry assuming $x = y$, but $z$ different.\\n\\nBut from above, $f(x) = f(y) = f(z)$, so either $z = x$ or $xz = -1$.\\n\\nCase 1: all equal → already considered: $x = y = z = 1$ or $\\\\frac{1}{2}$\\n\\nWait: when we solved $\\\\frac{1}{x} + 2x = 3$, we got $x = 1, \\\\frac{1}{2}$, but these correspond to the symmetric case.\\n\\nBut are there asymmetric solutions?\\n\\nSuppose $x \\\\ne y$, then $xy = -1$. Similarly, if $x \\\\ne z$, then $xz = -1$, etc.\\n\\nSuppose not all equal. Then at least one pair differs.\\n\\nSuppose $x \\\\ne y$, so $xy = -1$.\\nAlso, $f(x) = f(z)$, so either $x = z$ or $xz = -1$.\\nSimilarly for $y, z$.\\n\\nTry case: $x = z$, and $xy = -1$.\\nThen from $x = z$, and $xy = -1 \\\\Rightarrow y = -1/x$.\\n\\nNow use one equation:\\n\\nUse (1): $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{x} + (-1/x) + x = 0 + x = x$\\nSet equal to 3: $x = 3$\\n\\nThen $z = x = 3$, $y = -1/3$\\n\\nNow check second equation: $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = 3 + \\\\frac{1}{-1/3} + 3 = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3$: good.\\n\\nThird equation: $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 3 + (-1/3) + 1/3 = 3 + 0 = 3$: good.\\n\\nFirst equation: $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = 1/3 - 1/3 + 3 = 3$: good.\\n\\nSo this works! $x = 3, y = -1/3, z = 3$\\n\\nBut $x = z = 3$, $y = -1/3$\\n\\nNow $x + y + z = 3 - 1/3 + 3 = 6 - 1/3 = 17/3$\\n\\nBut earlier we had symmetric cases: sum 3 and 1.5\\n\\nBut is this valid? $x, y, z$ are real numbers, no restriction.\\n\\nBut wait: in first equation: $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = 1/3 - 1/3 + 3 = 3$: yes.\\nSecond: $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = 3 + (-3) + 3 = 3$: yes.\\nThird: $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 3 - 1/3 + 1/3 = 3$: yes.\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nBut now, is this the only asymmetric type?\\n\\nBy symmetry, we could have any one variable different.\\n\\nIn this solution, $y$ is different, $x = z = 3$, $y = -1/3$\\n\\nBut $f(y) = \\\\frac{1}{y} - y = -3 - (-1/3) = -3 + 1/3 = -8/3$\\n$f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{3} - 3 = -8/3$: same.\\n\\nNow, what if two variables are equal to $a$, third is $b$, with $ab = -1$?\\n\\nAssume $x = y = a$, $z = b$, and since $f(a) = f(b)$, either $a = b$ or $ab = -1$.\\n\\nIf $a = b$, symmetric case.\\nIf $ab = -1$, then $b = -1/a$\\n\\nNow plug into equations.\\n\\nUse equation (1): $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{a} + a + b = \\\\frac{1}{a} + a - \\\\frac{1}{a} = a$\\nSet to 3: $a = 3$\\nThen $b = -1/3$\\nSo $x = y = 3$, $z = -1/3$\\n\\nCheck equation (2): $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = 3 + 1/3 + (-1/3) = 3$: good.\\nEquation (3): $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 3 + 3 + (-3) = 3$: good.\\nEquation (1): $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = 1/3 + 3 - 1/3 = 3$: good.\\n\\nSo another solution: $x = y = 3$, $z = -1/3$, sum = $3 + 3 - 1/3 = 6 - 1/3 = 17/3$\\n\\nSame sum.\\n\\nSimilarly, any permutation where two variables are 3, one is -1/3? No: in previous case, when $x = z = 3$, $y = -1/3$, sum still 3+3-1/3=17/3\\n\\nBut if two are 3, one is -1/3, sum is $3+3-1/3=17/3$, or $3 -1/3 +3=17/3$\\n\\nBut earlier symmetric solutions: all 1: sum 3; all 1/2: sum 1.5 = 3/2\\n\\nBut in asymmetric case, sum is 17/3 ≈ 5.666\\n\\nBut are there more?\\n\\nWhat if all three are different?\\n\\nSuppose $x, y, z$ all distinct.\\nThen since $f(x)=f(y)=f(z)$, we must have pairwise products -1:\\n$xy = -1$, $yz = -1$, $zx = -1$\\n\\nFrom $xy = -1$, $yz = -1$: divide: $x/z = 1 \\\\Rightarrow x = z$\\nContradiction to all distinct.\\nSo impossible.\\n\\nThus only possibilities:\\n- All equal: $x=y=z$\\n- Two equal, third different with product -1 with them\\n\\nNow, in the two-equal case, we assumed two equal to $a$, third $b = -1/a$\\n\\nWe did: $x=y=a$, $z=b=-1/a$\\n\\nThen from equation (1): $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{a} + a + (-1/a) = a$\\nSet to 3: $a = 3$\\nSo forced.\\n\\nSimilarly, if we try other assignments, same thing.\\n\\nBut what if the \\\"different\\\" variable is in a different position?\\n\\nSuppose $x = a$, $y = b = -1/a$, $z = a$\\nThen equation (1): $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{a} + (-1/a) + a = 0 + a = a = 3$\\nSame as before.\\n\\nSo always $a = 3$, $b = -1/3$\\n\\nSo asymmetric solutions: two variables are 3, one is -1/3\\n\\nNumber of such: 3 choices for which variable is -1/3\\n\\nBut all give same sum: $3 + 3 - 1/3 = 17/3$\\n\\nNow symmetric cases: all equal.\\n\\nWe had $\\\\frac{1}{x} + 2x = 3$ → $2x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0$ → $(2x - 1)(x - 1) = 0$ → $x = 1$ or $x = 1/2$\\n\\nSo two symmetric solutions:\\n- $x=y=z=1$: sum = 3\\n- $x=y=z=1/2$: sum = 3/2\\n\\nAre there other symmetric solutions? No.\\n\\nNow, total possible values of $x+y+z$: \\n- 3 (from all 1)\\n- 3/2 (from all 1/2)\\n- 17/3 (from two 3's and one -1/3)\\n\\nBut is 17/3 achievable? Yes, as above.\\n\\nBut wait: in the asymmetric case, when we set $x=y=3$, $z=-1/3$, we need to verify all equations.\\nWe did: all satisfied.\\n\\nBut is there a constraint that variables nonzero? Yes, since we have $1/x$, etc., so $x,y,z \\\\ne 0$, which is satisfied.\\n\\nSo possible sums: $3$, $\\\\frac{3}{2}$, $\\\\frac{17}{3}$\\n\\nSum of all possible values: $3 + \\\\frac{3}{2} + \\\\frac{17}{3} = ?$\\n\\nCompute:\\nCommon denominator 6: $\\\\frac{18}{6} + \\\\frac{9}{6} + \\\\frac{34}{6} = \\\\frac{61}{6}$\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"the sum of all possible values of $x+y+z$\\\"\\n\\nAre these values distinct? Yes: 1.5, 3, ~5.666\\n\\nBut is each value achieved? Yes.\\n\\nBut wait: the sum is over distinct possible values of the sum $x+y+z$, not over solutions.\\n\\nYes, three distinct values: $\\\\frac{3}{2}, 3, \\\\frac{17}{3}$\\n\\nSum: $\\\\frac{3}{2} + 3 + \\\\frac{17}{3} = \\\\frac{3}{2} + \\\\frac{6}{2} + \\\\frac{17}{3} = \\\\frac{9}{2} + \\\\frac{17}{3} = \\\\frac{27}{6} + \\\\frac{34}{6} = \\\\frac{61}{6}$\\n\\nNow, $\\\\frac{m}{n} = \\\\frac{61}{6}$, gcd(61,6)=1, so $m=61, n=6$\\n\\nThen $100m + n = 100*61 + 6 = 6100 + 6 = 6106$\\n\\nBut wait: is $x=y=z=1/2$ really a solution?\\n\\nCheck: $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = 2 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 3$: yes\\n$x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = 0.5 + 2 + 0.5 = 3$: yes\\n$x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 0.5 + 0.5 + 2 = 3$: yes\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nAnd $x=y=z=1$: obviously.\\n\\nAnd asymmetric: yes.\\n\\nBut in asymmetric, sum is always 17/3, regardless of which variable is -1/3.\\n\\nSo only three distinct values for $x+y+z$.\\n\\nBut is there a solution where, say, $x=3, y=3, z=-1/3$, sum=17/3\\nOr permutations, but sum same.\\n\\nSo distinct sums: 3/2, 3, 17/3\\n\\nSum: 3/2 + 3 + 17/3 = as above 61/6\\n\\nBut let me double-check the asymmetric case.\\n\\nSuppose $x=3, y=3, z=-1/3$\\nThen:\\n1. $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = 1/3 + 3 - 1/3 = 3$: good\\n2. $x + \\\\frac{1}{y} + z = 3 + 1/3 - 1/3 = 3$: good\\n3. $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = 3 + 3 + (-3) = 3$: good\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nNow, is there a solution where, say, $x=-1/3, y=3, z=3$? Same sum.\\n\\nBut what if we try to set $x=y=a$, $z=b=-1/a$, but use a different equation?\\n\\nWe used equation (1), got $a=3$\\n\\nBut suppose we use equation (3): $x + y + \\\\frac{1}{z} = a + a + \\\\frac{1}{b} = 2a + \\\\frac{1}{(-1/a)} = 2a - a = a$\\nSet to 3: $a=3$: same.\\n\\nSo forced.\\n\\nThus only possibilities.\\n\\nBut earlier when all equal, we have two solutions.\\n\\nBut is there an asymmetric solution where the two equal variables are not 3?\\n\\nSuppose $x=z=a$, $y=b$, with $ab=-1$\\nThen from equation (1): $\\\\frac{1}{x} + y + z = \\\\frac{1}{a} + b + a$\\nBut $b = -1/a$, so $\\\\frac{1}{a} - \\\\frac{1}{a} + a = a = 3$\\nAgain $a=3$\\n\\nSame.\\n\\nSo no other solutions.\\n\\nThus the possible values of $x+y+z$ are $\\\\frac{3}{2}, 3, \\\\frac{17}{3}$\\n\\nSum: $\\\\frac{3}{2} + 3 + \\\\frac{17}{3} = \\\\frac{9}{6} + \\\\frac{18}{6} + \\\\frac{34}{6} = \\\\frac{61}{6}$\\n\\nSo $m=61, n=6$, $100m+n=6100+6=6106$\\n\\nBut wait: in the symmetric case $x=y=z=1/2$, sum is 3/2\\nBut is this consistent with the function?\\n$f(x)=\\\\frac{1}{x}-x=2 - 0.5=1.5$\\nFor all, same.\\n\\nAnd in asymmetric, $f(3)=1/3 - 3 = -8/3$, $f(-1/3)=-3 - (-1/3)=-3+1/3=-8/3$: same.\\n\\nAll good.\\n\\nNow Problem 2:\\n\\nRegular polygons: $ICAO$, $VENTI$, $ALBEDO$\\n\\nGiven $IN=1$, find number of possible values of $ON$\\n\\nFirst, identify the polygons:\\n\\n- $ICAO$: 4 vertices → square? Regular quadrilateral → square\\n- $VENTI$: 6 vertices → regular hexagon\\n- $ALBEDO$: 7 vertices → regular heptagon\\n\\nAll lie on a plane.\\n\\nPoints: I,C,A,O from first; V,E,N,T,I from second — note I is shared; A,L,B,E,D,O from third — A,E,O shared?\\n\\nList points:\\n\\nPolygon 1: I, C, A, O → cyclic order? Probably I-C-A-O-I\\nSince regular, vertices equally spaced on circle.\\n\\nSimilarly, VENTI: V,E,N,T,I → 5 vertices? V-E-N-T-I-V → 5 sides → regular pentagon!\\n\\\"VENTI\\\" has 5 letters: V,E,N,T,I → pentagon.\\n\\nALBEDO: A,L,B,E,D,O → 6 letters? A,L,B,E,D,O → hexagon.\\n\\nCount: A,L,B,E,D,O → 6 vertices → regular hexagon.\\n\\nBut earlier I said heptagon, mistake.\\n\\nSo:\\n- ICAO: 4 letters → regular quadrilateral → square\\n- VENTI: 5 letters → regular pentagon\\n- ALBEDO: 6 letters → regular hexagon\\n\\nAll regular polygons, lying on a plane.\\n\\nShared vertices:\\n- I is in ICAO and VENTI\\n- A is in ICAO and ALBEDO\\n- E is in VENTI and ALBEDO\\n- O is in ICAO and ALBEDO\\n\\nAnd N is in VENTI only? But we need ON, so O and N.\\n\\nGiven IN = 1, find possible values of ON.\\n\\nSince polygons are regular and share vertices, their positions are constrained.\\n\\nWe need to consider how these polygons are arranged in the plane, sharing the common vertices.\\n\\nEach polygon has its own circumcircle, but since they share vertices, the circles may be different.\\n\\nThe key is that multiple polygons share vertices, so the distances and angles are related.\\n\\nList the shared points:\\n- Point I: vertex of square ICAO and pentagon VENTI\\n- Point A: vertex of square ICAO and hexagon ALBEDO\\n- Point O: vertex of square ICAO and hexagon ALBEDO\\n- Point E: vertex of pentagon VENTI and hexagon ALBEDO\\n\\nAnd N is a vertex of pentagon VENTI.\\n\\nGiven distance IN = 1, find possible lengths of ON.\\n\\nSince the polygons are regular, the side lengths may differ, but the relative positions depend on the embedding.\\n\\nMoreover, the polygons can be rotated relative to each other, but the shared vertices fix some constraints.\\n\\nActually, the entire figure is determined up to the sizes and relative orientations, but with shared vertices, the distances between non-shared points like O and N will depend on the configuration.\\n\\nBut we need to find how many possible values ON can take, given IN=1.\\n\\nProbably, due to rotational symmetries or different ways to attach, there might be multiple configurations.\\n\\nFirst, consider the square ICAO.\\nVertices in order: probably I-C-A-O-I, so adjacent: I to C, C to A, A to O, O to I.\\nSince regular, all sides equal, angles 90 degrees.\\n\\nSimilarly, pentagon VENTI: V-E-N-T-I-V, so vertices in order: V,E,N,T,I\\nAdjacent: V-E, E-N, N-T, T-I, I-V\\n\\nHexagon ALBEDO: A-L-B-E-D-O-A, so A to L, L to B, B to E, E to D, D to O, O to A\\n\\nNow, shared points:\\n- I: common to square and pentagon\\n- A: common to square and hexagon\\n- O: common to square and hexagon\\n- E: common to pentagon and hexagon\\n\\nNote that in the square ICAO, points I,A,O are vertices.\\nSpecifically, depending on labeling.\\nAssume the square is labeled in cyclic order: I -> C -> A -> O -> I\\nThen, the diagonal: I to A, C to O, etc.\\nDistance IA: if side length s, then diagonal s√2\\nSimilarly, IO: adjacent? I to O: in cycle I-C-A-O-I, so I to C, C to A, A to O, O to I, so O and I are adjacent, so IO is a side.\\nSimilarly, I to A is diagonal.\\n\\nIn quadrilateral I-C-A-O, with edges IC, CA, AO, OI.\\nSo vertices adjacent: I-C, C-A, A-O, O-I.\\nSo I and O are adjacent, so IO is a side of the square.\\nSimilarly, I and A are not adjacent; separated by C or by O, so diagonal.\\n\\nSimilarly, in pentagon VENTI: V-E-N-T-I-V\\nSo vertices: V,E,N,T,I\\nAdjacent: V-E, E-N, N-T, T-I, I-V\\nSo I is adjacent to V and T.\\nN is adjacent to E and T.\\nSo IN: I and N are not adjacent; path I-T-N or I-V-E-N, so separated by one or two vertices.\\nIn pentagon, distance between I and N: positions.\\nLabel pentagon vertices in order: say P1=V, P2=E, P3=N, P4=T, P5=I\\nThen I is P5, N is P3, so |5-3|=2, so separated by one vertex.\\nIn regular pentagon, chord spanning 2 sides: length = side * φ, where φ=(1+√5)/2, golden ratio.\\nSpecifically, in unit pentagon, diagonal length is φ = (1+√5)/2\\nHere, IN is such a diagonal.\\n\\nSimilarly, in hexagon ALBEDO: A-L-B-E-D-O-A\\nSay Q1=A, Q2=L, Q3=B, Q4=E, Q5=D, Q6=O\\nThen A to L, L to B, B to E, E to D, D to O, O to A\\nSo O is Q6, A is Q1, adjacent since O to A is edge.\\nE is Q4.\\n\\nNow, shared: A and O are both in square and hexagon.\\nIn square ICAO, A and O are adjacent, since A-O is an edge.\\nIn hexagon, A and O are also adjacent, since O-A is an edge.\\nSimilarly, in square, I and O adjacent.\\n\\nNow, the critical point is that points A, I, O are all connected through the square.\\nSpecifically, in square I-C-A-O, with edges IC, CA, AO, OI.\\nSo triangle I-A-O: points I,A,O.\\nDistances: IO = side of square, say s\\nAO = side of square, s\\nIA = diagonal = s√2\\nAngle at O: between IO and AO.\\nIn the square, at vertex O, the angle is 90 degrees, between edges O-I and O-A.\\nSo angle IOA is 90 degrees.\\n\\nSo in triangle IOA, we have IO = s, AO = s, angle O = 90°, so IA = s√2, as expected.\\n\\nNow, this triangle IOA is fixed once s is known, but s is not fixed.\\n\\nNow, additionally, point E is in both pentagon and hexagon.\\n\\nPentagon has points V,E,N,T,I\\nHexagon has A,L,B,E,D,O\\n\\nE is common.\\n\\nNow, we need to relate I,N,O.\\n\\nGiven IN=1, find ON.\\n\\nN is in pentagon, O in hexagon and square.\\n\\nTo find distance ON, we need coordinates or vector geometry.\\n\\nSince multiple polygons share vertices, we can fix some points.\\n\\nNote that the relative positions depend on the orientations of the polygons.\\n\\nFor example, the square ICAO: once I and O are fixed, and since angle at O is 90 degrees, and AO = IO, but the direction of A relative to I and O can be in two ways: on one side or the other of line IO.\\n\\nSimilarly for other polygons.\\n\\nSo there might be multiple configurations due to reflections or rotations.\\n\\nLet us try to fix coordinate system.\\n\\nPlace point O at origin (0,0).\\nSince IO is a side of square, and AO is another side, and angle at O is 90 degrees.\\n\\nSet vector OI along x-axis.\\nSo let I be at (s, 0), since IO = s.\\nThen, since angle at O is 90 degrees, and AO = s, A can be at (0,s) or (0,-s).\\nTwo choices: above or below.\\n\\nWithout loss of generality, assume A is at (0,s). (We'll consider the other case later if needed.)\\n\\nSo:\\nO: (0,0)\\nI: (s, 0)\\nA: (0,s)\\n\\nNow, C is the fourth vertex of square. Since I-C-A, and I(s,0), A(0,s), and it's a square, C should be at (s,s), because vector IC should be perpendicular to OI, etc.\\nFrom I to C: if going I to C to A, and I(s,0), A(0,s), then C should be such that IC perpendicular to CA, and lengths equal.\\nVector from I to A is (-s,s), so diagonal.\\nIn square, from I to C should be rotated 90 degrees from I to O or something.\\nStandard: from O(0,0), I(s,0), A(0,s), then C, to complete square, should be (s,s), since then IC from (s,0) to (s,s) is up, CA from (s,s) to (0,s) is left, etc.\\nYes.\\n\\nNow, pentagon VENTI: vertices V,E,N,T,I, with I fixed at (s,0)\\nIt's a regular pentagon, so all sides equal, say length p, and angles 108 degrees.\\nI is a vertex.\\nThe pentagon can be oriented in different ways around I.\\nSpecifically, the two edges from I: to V and to T.\\nIn the pentagon, I is adjacent to V and T.\\nThe angle at I is 108 degrees.\\nThe direction of the edges can vary.\\n\\nSimilarly, the pentagon can be on one side or the other of the plane.\\n\\nBut since it's in plane, and we have another constraint from point E, which is also in the hexagon.\\n\\nSimilarly, hexagon ALBEDO: has points A(0,s), E, D, O(0,0), and others.\\nA and O are fixed, and in hexagon, A and O are adjacent, since edge O-A.\\nIn regular hexagon, adjacent vertices are connected by side.\\nDistance AO: from A(0,s) to O(0,0) is |s|, so the side length of the hexagon is |s|, since AO is a side.\\nIs that right?\\nIn our setting, AO = distance from (0,s) to (0,0) = s (assuming s>0), and since A and O are adjacent in hexagon, yes, so side length of hexagon is s.\\n\\nSimilarly, for the square, side length is also s, since IO=s, AO=s.\\nSo both square and hexagon have side length s.\\n\\nNow, hexagon ALBEDO: vertices A,L,B,E,D,O in order.\\nSo starting from A, to L, to B, to E, to D, to O, to A.\\nSince regular hexagon with side s, and A and O are adjacent.\\nIn a regular hexagon, adjacent vertices are separated by 60 degrees at center.\\nBut here, we have two adjacent vertices A and O.\\nThe vector from A to O is (0-0, 0-s) = (0,-s), downward.\\nIn the hexagon, from A to L is the next edge.\\nIn a regular hexagon, the turn at each vertex is 120 degrees externally, but direction.\\nFrom vertex A, one edge to O, one edge to L.\\nThe angle at A is 120 degrees.\\nThe direction from A to O is down, vector (0,-s)\\nThen, the edge from A to L could be at +60 degrees or -60 degrees relative to the incoming, but standard.\\nIn regular hexagon, the two edges from a vertex are at 120 degrees to each other.\\nSo from A, vector to O is (0,-s), downward.\\nThen vector to L: could be at 120 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise from the direction to O.\\nBut the direction.\\nLet me think of the tangent.\\nAt vertex A, the two adjacent vertices are O and L.\\nThe vector from A to O is \\vec{AO} = (0-0, 0-s) = (0,-s)\\nVector from A to L is \\vec{AL}\\n|\\vec{AL}| = s, and angle between \\vec{AO} and \\vec{AL} is 120 degrees, since internal angle 120°.\\nSo dot product: \\vec{AO} \\\\cdot \\vec{AL} = |AO||AL| \\\\cos 120° = s * s * (-1/2) = -s²/2\\n\\vec{AO} = (0,-s), so let \\vec{AL} = (x,y), then (0)(x) + (-s)(y) = -s y = -s²/2 ⇒ y = s/2\\nAnd x² + y² = s² ⇒ x² + (s²/4) = s² ⇒ x² = (3/4)s² ⇒ x = ± (√3/2) s\\nSo \\vec{AL} = (± (√3/2) s, s/2)\\nSo L is at A + \\vec{AL} = (0,s) + (± (√3/2)s, s/2) = (± (√3/2)s, s + s/2) = (± (√3/2)s, (3/2)s)\\nNow, similarly, the hexagon continues.\\nBut we need point E.\\nFrom the sequence: A -> L -> B -> E -> D -> O -> A\\nSo from A to L to B to E.\\nAfter L, to B, then to E.\\nIn regular hexagon, each step turns 60 degrees, but let's compute coordinates.\\nAssume first the + sign: L at ((√3/2)s, (3/2)s)\\nThen from L to B: in hexagon, direction.\\nVector from A to L is ((√3/2)s, s/2)\\nThen from L to B: should be rotated 60 degrees, but in regular hexagon, the direction changes by 60 degrees at each vertex? No.\\nIn a regular polygon, the direction of edges.\\nFrom edge A to L: vector \\vec{AL} = ((√3/2)s, s/2)\\nThis has direction: tan^{-1}((s/2)/(√3 s /2) = tan^{-1}(1/√3) = 30 degrees.\\nThen next edge L to B: in regular hexagon, the turn is 120 degrees internally, so the direction change.\\nThe external angle is 60 degrees, so the direction of the edge turns by 60 degrees.\\nSpecifically, for convex polygon, it turns by the external angle.\\nSo if we go from A to L in direction θ, then from L to B in direction θ + 60° or θ - 60°, depending on orientation.\\nSince it's regular and convex, likely consistent turn.\\nAssuming counter-clockwise: from A to L: vector ((√3/2)s, s/2), which is direction 30° from x-axis.\\nThen at L, turn left (external angle 60°), so new direction 30° + 60° = 90°.\\nSo vector L to B: length s, direction 90°, so (0,s)\\nThus B is at L + (0,s) = ((√3/2)s, (3/2)s + s) = ((√3/2)s, (5/2)s)\\nThen from B to E: turn left 60°, new direction 90° + 60° = 150°\\nVector: s * (cos150°, sin150°) = s*(-√3/2, 1/2)\\nSo E is at B + (-√3/2 s, 1/2 s) = ((√3/2 - √3/2)s, (5/2 + 1/2)s) = (0, 3s)\\nThen from E to D: direction 150° + 60° = 210°, vector s*(cos210°, sin210°) = s*(-√3/2, -1/2)\\nD at (0 - √3/2 s, 3s - 1/2 s) = (-√3/2 s, 5/2 s)\\nThen D to O: direction 210° + 60° = 270°, vector (0, -s)\\nO at (-√3/2 s, 5/2 s - s) = (-√3/2 s, 3/2 s)? But we have O at (0,0), contradiction.\\nMistake.\\nWe have O fixed at (0,0), but here we get O at (-√3/2 s, 3/2 s), not (0,0).\\nInconsistency.\\nWhat's wrong?\\nAh, I see. When we go from D to O, and O should be at (0,0), but in this path, we ended at different point.\\nThe issue is that in the hexagon, we have fixed A and O, and they are adjacent, but in a regular hexagon, the distance between adjacent vertices is s, which matches, but the vector from A to O is (0,-s), downward.\\nIn a regular hexagon, if we go from A to O directly, but in the sequence, it's A-L-B-E-D-O, so A to O is not direct in the boundary, but they are connected by an edge, so in the polygon, A and O are adjacent, so there should be an edge between them.\\nIn my calculation, I have edge from D to O and from O to A, so yes.\\nBut in the coordinate, I started from A, went to L, B, E, D, then to O, but I need O to be at (0,0).\\nBut in my calc, when I reach O, it's not at (0,0), so the orientation is wrong.\\nActually, the choice of direction for AL determines the shape.\\nI chose \\vec{AL} with +x, but perhaps it should be the other way.\\nMoreover, the sequence might be clockwise or counter-clockwise.\\nIn my assumption, I went A to L with +x component, then continued counter-clockwise, but ended up with O not at origin.\\nPerhaps the hexagon is oriented clockwise.\\nOr perhaps from A, the edge to L is in the other direction.\\nRecall that \\vec{AL} could be (± (√3/2)s, s/2)\\nI took + , giving x positive.\\nNow try the minus sign: \\vec{AL} = (- (√3/2)s, s/2)\\nThen L at (0,s) + (-√3/2 s, s/2) = (-√3/2 s, 3s/2)\\nNow, assume counter-clockwise: from A to L: vector (-√3/2 s, s/2), direction tan^{-1}((s/2)/(-√3 s /2) = tan^{-1}(-1/√3), since x<0,y>0, second quadrant, so 180° - 30° = 150°\\nThen at L, turn left 60°, new direction 150° + 60° = 210°\\nVector L to B: s*(cos210°, sin210°) = s*(-√3/2, -1/2)\\nB at L + (-√3/2 s, -1/2 s) = (-√3/2 - √3/2)s, (3/2 - 1/2)s) = (-√3 s, s)\\nThen B to E: direction 210° + 60° = 270°, vector (0, -s)\\nE at (-√3 s, s - s) = (-√3 s, 0)\\nThen E to D: direction 270° + 60° = 330°, vector s*(cos330°, sin330°) = s*(√3/2, -1/2)\\nD at (-√3 s + √3/2 s, 0 - 1/2 s) = (-√3/2 s, -1/2 s)\\nThen D to O: direction 330° + 60° = 390° ≡ 30°, vector s*(cos30°, sin30°) = s*(√3/2, 1/2)\\nO at (-√3/2 s + √3/2 s, -1/2 s + 1/2 s) = (0,0): perfect!\\nSo with this choice, O is at (0,0), good.\\nAnd E is at (-√3 s, 0)\\nNow, if we had chosen the other orientation, but this works.\\nBut is there another possibility? Earlier I assumed counter-clockwise traversal.\\nWhat if clockwise?\\nBut in this case, with \\vec{AL} = (-√3/2 s, s/2), and counter-clockwise, we got E at (-√3 s, 0)\\nNow, if we go clockwise, but usually polygons are traversed consistently, but let's see.\\nSuppose from A, \\vec{AL} = (-√3/2 s, s/2), same vector, but now traverse clockwise.\\nThen from A to L: direction 150°\\nAt L, for clockwise, turn right 60°, so new direction 150° - 60° = 90°\\nVector L to B: s*(cos90°, sin90°) = (0,s)\\nB at (-√3/2 s, 3s/2) + (0,s) = (-√3/2 s, 5s/2)\\nThen B to E: direction 90° - 60° = 30°, vector s*(cos30°, sin30°) = s*(√3/2, 1/2)\\nE at (-√3/2 + √3/2)s, (5/2 + 1/2)s) = (0, 3s)\\nThen E to D: direction 30° - 60° = -30° ≡ 330°, vector s*(cos330°, sin330°) = s*(√3/2, -1/2)\\nD at (0 + √3/2 s, 3s - 1/2 s) = (√3/2 s, 5s/2)\\nThen D to O: direction 330° - 60° = 270°, vector (0,-s)\\nO at (√3/2 s, 5s/2 - s) = (√3/2 s, 3s/2) ≠ (0,0), not good.\\nIf we start with the other \\vec{AL}, say (+√3/2 s, s/2), and go clockwise.\\n\\vec{AL} = (√3/2 s, s/2), L at (√3/2 s, 3s/2)\\nDirection from A to L: tan^{-1}((s/2)/(√3 s /2)) = tan^{-1}(1/√3)=30°\\nClockwise: at L, turn right 60°, new direction 30° - 60° = -30° ≡ 330°\\nVector L to B: s*(cos330°, sin330°) = s*(√3/2, -1/2)\\nB at (√3/2 + √3/2)s, (3/2 - 1/2)s) = (√3 s, s)\\nThen B to E: direction 330° - 60° = 270°, vector (0,-s)\\nE at (√3 s, s - s) = (√3 s, 0)\\nThen E to D: direction 270° - 60° = 210°, vector s*(cos210°, sin210°) = s*(-√3/2, -1/2)\\nD at (√3 s - √3/2 s, 0 - 1/2 s) = (√3/2 s, -1/2 s)\\nThen D to O: direction 210° - 60° = 150°, vector s*(cos150°, sin150°) = s*(-√3/2, 1/2)\\nO at (√3/2 - √3/2)s, (-1/2 + 1/2)s) = (0,0): good.\\nSo another possibility: with \\vec{AL} = (√3/2 s, s/2), clockwise traversal, then E is at (√3 s, 0)\\nSo in summary, for the hexagon, with A(0,s), O(0,0), we have two possible positions for E:\\n1. E at (-√3 s, 0)\\n2. E at (√3 s, 0)\\nBoth at distance √3 s from origin, on the x-axis.\\nNow, similarly, the pentagon VENTI has vertex I(s,0), and is regular with side length p, say.\\nBut we don't know p yet.\\nAlso, it shares vertex E with the hexagon.\\nE is a vertex of both pentagon and hexagon.\\nSo E must be a vertex of the pentagon VENTI.\\nIn the pentagon, vertices include E and I.\\nSo both I and E are vertices of the regular pentagon.\\nSo the distance between I and E must be consistent with the pentagon's geometry.\\nIn a regular pentagon with side length p, the distance between two vertices depends on how many sides apart they are.\\nPossible distances: adjacent: p, or separated by one vertex: diagonal, length pφ, where φ=(1+√5)/2 ≈1.618p, or opposite, but in pentagon, maximum separation is two sides, same as diagonal.\\nSpecifically, in regular pentagon, all non-adjacent pairs have the same distance, the diagonal, since it's symmetric.\\nVertices: label 1,2,3,4,5.\\nDistance between i and j: min(|i-j|, 5-|i-j|)\\nIf min dist 1: adjacent, distance p\\nMin dist 2: separated by one, distance d = p * φ = p(1+√5)/2\\nIn pentagon VENTI, the vertices are V,E,N,T,I in order.\\nSo let's assign: say V1=V, V2=E, V3=N, V4=T, V5=I\\nThen E is V2, I is V5\\n|2-5|=3, min(3,5-3)=min(3,2)=2, so separated by min 2 steps, so distance should be the diagonal length, d = p φ\\nThe path: E to N to T to I: three steps, or E to V to I: but V1 to V2 to V5? V1 to V5 is not direct; the short path is E to V to I or E to N to T to I, both length 2 edges? From E to I: via V: E-V-I, two edges, so chord spans two sides, so yes, distance is the diagonal, d = p φ\\nSimilarly, any two vertices two apart.\\nSo distance EI = p * φ, where φ = (1+√5)/2\\nNow, in our coordinate, I is at (s, 0)\\nE is at either (-√3 s, 0) or (√3 s, 0)\\nSo distance EI = | (s,0) - (-√3 s, 0) | = |s + √3 s| = s(1 + √3) if E at (-√3 s,0)\\nOr |s - √3 s| = |s| |1 - √3| = s(√3 - 1) since √3 >1, if E at (√3 s,0)\\nNow, this distance must equal p φ = p (1+√5)/2\\nBut p is the side length of the pentagon, which is unknown.\\nAdditionally, we have point N in the pentagon.\\nN is V3 in our labeling, at position 3.\\nI is V5, E is V2.\\nIn the pentagon, we can find coordinates of N relative to I and E.\\nBut since the pentagon can be oriented in two ways (reflected), there might be two positions for N for each choice of E.\\nBut first, we have two choices for E's position, and for each, EI distance is fixed in terms of s, and must equal p φ, so p is determined in terms of s.\\nThen, for each such pentagon, we can find N, then distance to O(0,0).\\nBut also, the pentagon can be reflected, so two orientations.\\nNow, let's compute.\\nFirst, case 1: E at (-√3 s, 0)\\nThen EI = distance between I(s,0) and E(-√3 s, 0) = |s - (-√3 s)| = s(1 + √3)\\nThis must equal p φ = p (1+√5)/2\\nSo p = [2s(1 + √3)] / (1 + √5)\\nNow, in the pentagon, with vertices E(V2), I(V5), and N(V3)\\nPositions: V2, V3, V4, V5\\nSo from E to I: V2 to V5, which is three steps forward, or two steps backward.\\nIn the pentagon, the vector from E to I.\\nTo find coordinates of N.\\nSince it's regular, we can place the pentagon in the plane with E and I fixed.\\nBut E and I are fixed in space, distance d = s(1+√3)\\nIn a regular pentagon, two vertices at distance d, which is the diagonal length, since adjacent would be p, but d = pφ > p.\\nWhen two vertices are separated by two edges (i.e., span two sides), the distance is pφ.\\nIn this case, E and I are separated by two edges: E to V to I, or E to N to T to I, but the shorter path is two edges: E-V-I or E-T-I? In our labeling V1=V,V2=E,V3=N,V4=T,V5=I, so E(V2) to I(V5): can go E-V1-I? V2 to V1 to V5, but V1 to V5 is not an edge; edges are between consecutive.\\nPath: V2 to V1, V1 to V5? But V1 to V5 is not an edge; the edges are V1-V2, V2-V3, V3-V4, V4-V5, V5-V1.\\nSo from V2 to V5: paths: V2-V3-V4-V5 (three edges), or V2-V1-V5 (two edges: V2-V1 and V1-V5)\\nYes, so shortest path is two edges, so they are at graph distance 2, so Euclidean distance is the diagonal d = p φ.\\nIn a regular pentagon, for two vertices at distance 2, the line segment is a diagonal.\\nTo find the position of N, which is V3.\\nV3 is adjacent to V2 and V4.\\nIn the pentagon, we can find the location.\\nFix points E and I.\\nSet E at (0,0), I at (d, 0), with d = s(1+√3)\\nBut in our global coord, E is at (-√3 s, 0), I at (s,0), so vector from E to I is (s - (-√3 s), 0-0) = (s(1+√3), 0), so indeed along x-axis, length d = s(1+√3)\\nNow, in the regular pentagon, with E and I fixed, distance d, which is the diagonal length.\\nWhere can the other vertices be?\\nSpecifically, N is V3.\\nFrom E(V2), the adjacent vertices are V1 and V3.\\nFrom I(V5), adjacent are V4 and V1.\\nThe pentagon can be above or below the line EI.\\nSo two possible positions for the pentagon: one on each side of the line EI.\\nFor each, we can compute the position of N.\\nThen find distance to O(0,0) in global coord.\\nSimilarly for the other choice of E.\\nFirst, for this case: E at (-√3 s, 0), I at (s, 0), d = s(1+√3)\\nSet local coord: let E be at (0,0), I at (d, 0)\\nIn regular pentagon, with V2 at (0,0), V5 at (d,0)\\nThe vector from V2 to V3, and V2 to V1.\\nIn a regular pentagon, the angle at V2 is 108 degrees.\\nThe direction to V3 and V1.\\nThe diagonal V2 to V5.\\nIn a regular pentagon, the diagonal length is φ times side, and φ = (1+√5)/2\\nThe angle between two diagonals, but here.\\nFrom V2, the adjacent vertices V1 and V3 are at distance p from V2.\\nThe vector from V2 to V5 is (d,0)\\nIn the pentagon, the position.\\nNote that in regular pentagon, the triangle V2-V3-V4-V5, but perhaps use complex numbers.\\nRepresent the vertices on complex plane.\\nLet ω = e^{i * 2π/5} = cos(72°) + i sin(72°)\\nThen vertices at r ω^k for k=0,1,2,3,4, but scaled.\\nSet the center, but easier to set two points.\\nSuppose we set V2 at 0, V5 at d.\\nThen the other points.\\nIn regular pentagon, the chord V2V5 corresponds to an arc of 3 steps (since |2-5|=3, but min arc is min(3,2)*72°=144°? Each step 72°, so from V2 to V5, if labeled consecutively, the angular separation.\\nIf vertices at angles 0,72,144,216,288 degrees.\\nSet V2 at angle 0: so V2: r e^{i*0} = r\\nBetter: set the center at origin.\\nLet the circumradius be R.\\nThen vertices at R e^{i(θ + 2π k /5)} for k=0,1,2,3,4\\nSet V2 at k=0: so V2: R (cos θ, sin θ)\\nV5 at k=m, but |k_V5 - k_V2| =3 or 2 in index, but since cyclic, min difference 2 or 3, but in our case, if V2 and V5 are separated by 2 edges along the shorter arc, then angular separation is 2 * 72° = 144°\\nBecause each step 72°, two steps 144°.\\nAnd since the chord length for angle α is 2R sin(α/2)\\nFor α=144°, chord length = 2R sin(72°)\\nBut we know this is the diagonal d.\\nIn regular pentagon, diagonal d = 2R sin(72°)\\nSide p = 2R sin(36°)\\nAnd d/p = sin(72°)/sin(36°) = 2 cos(36°) since sin(72)=2 sin(36)cos(36)\\nAnd cos(36°)=(√5 +1)/4, so 2 cos(36°)= (√5 +1)/2 = φ, yes.\\nNow, in our case, distance between V2 and V5 is d, angular separation 144°.\\nSo d = 2R sin(72°)\\nThus R = d / (2 sin(72°))\\nNow, the position of V3.\\nV3 is adjacent to V2, so angular separation 72°.\\nFrom V2, V3 could be at +72° or -72° relative, but in the pentagon, it depends on the order.\\nIf the vertices are in order V1,V2,V3,V4,V5,V1, then from V2, next is V3 at +72° if counter-clockwise.\\nBut the angular separation to V5: if V2 at angle θ, V5 at θ + 3*72° = θ + 216°, or θ - 2*72° = θ - 144°, since min arc 144°.\\nIn our case, the vector from V2 to V5 is at angle 0 in local coord, since we set it along x-axis.\\nSo the direction from V2 to V5 is along positive x-axis.\\nNow, in the pentagon, from V2 to V5, the shorter arc could be clockwise or counter-clockwise.\\nBut since angular separation is 144° < 180°, it's fine.\\nNow, the position of V3 relative to V2.\\nV3 is at angular separation 72° from V2.\\nThe direction: it could be towards V5 or away.\\nSpecifically, if the pentagon is oriented such that from V2 to V3 is in the direction towards the side of V5 or opposite.\\nIn the plane, with V2 and V5 fixed, the center O_c of the pentagon must be such that angle V2 O_c V5 is 144°, and O_c V2 = O_c V5 = R.\\nSo the center lies on the perpendicular bisector of V2V5.\\nLet M be midpoint of V2V5.\\nV2 at (0,0), V5 at (d,0), so M at (d/2, 0)\\nPerpendicular bisector is x = d/2\\nNow, distance from O_c to V2 is R, and angle at O_c is 144°, so in triangle V2 O_c V5, isosceles with V2O_c = V5O_c = R, V2V5 = d, angle at O_c is 144°.\\nSo by law of cosines: d^2 = R^2 + R^2 - 2 R R cos(144°) = 2R^2 (1 - cos(144°))\\nCos(144°) = cos(180°-36°) = -cos(36°) = - (√5 +1)/4\\nSo d^2 = 2R^2 (1 - (- (√5 +1)/4)) = 2R^2 (1 + (√5 +1)/4) = 2R^2 ( (4 + √5 +1)/4 ) = 2R^2 (5 + √5)/4 = R^2 (5 + √5)/2\\nBut earlier d = 2R sin(72°), sin(72°)=2 sin(36°)cos(36°), but anyway.\\nFrom geometry, the distance from M to O_c.\\nIn triangle V2 O_c M, angle at O_c is half of 144°? No.\\nAngle at O_c is 144°, so in triangle V2 O_c V5, the line O_c M, since isosceles, M is midpoint, so O_c M is perpendicular to V2V5, and angle at O_c is split, but not necessarily.\\nActually, since isosceles, the median O_c M is also the angle bisector and altitude.\\nSo angle at O_c is bisected, so angle V2 O_c M = 72°\\nThen in right triangle V2 M O_c, angle at M is 90°, angle at O_c is 72°, hypotenuse V2 O_c = R\\nV2 M = d/2\\nSo sin(angle at O_c) = opposite/hypotenuse = V2 M / R = (d/2) / R\\nSo sin(72°) = (d/2) / R ⇒ R = d / (2 sin(72°)) as before.\\nThen O_c M = R cos(72°) , since adjacent.\\nCos(72°) = sin(18°) = (√5 -1)/4\\nSo O_c M = R cos(72°) = [d / (2 sin(72°))] * cos(72°) = (d / 2) cot(72°)\\nNow, the center O_c is at (d/2, h) or (d/2, -h), where h = O_c M = (d/2) cot(72°)? No\\nFrom above, in triangle, O_c M = R cos(72°), and since angle at O_c is 72°, and hypotenuse R, so adjacent to angle is O_c M, so yes, O_c M = R cos(72°)\\nAnd R = d / (2 sin(72°)), so h = |O_c M| = [d / (2 sin(72°))] cos(72°) = (d / 2) cot(72°)\\nNow cot(72°) = 1/tan(72°) = tan(18°) since tan(90-θ)=cotθ, but 90-72=18, so cot(72°)=tan(18°)\\nTan(18°)= ? Or compute numerically later.\\nNow, the sign: O_c can be above or below the x-axis, so y-coordinate ± h\\nNow, once we have O_c, we can find the vertices.\\nV2 is at (0,0), but in this local coord, V2 is at (0,0), but O_c is at (d/2, h) or (d/2, -h)\\nThe vector from O_c to V2 is (0 - d/2, 0 - h) = (-d/2, -h) if O_c at (d/2,h)\\nThen the angle.\\nThe vertices are at angles from O_c.\\nThe direction of O_c to V2.\\nLet θ be the argument of vector O_c to V2.\\nThen V3 is at angle θ + 72° or θ - 72°, depending on orientation.\\nIn the pentagon, if we go counter-clockwise, from V2 to V3, it should be increasing angle.\\nBut we need to see the order.\\nFrom V2 to V5, if we go V2-V3-V4-V5, that's three steps, or V2-V1-V5, two steps.\\nThe shorter arc is V2-V1-V5, two steps.\\nIn terms of angle, if the pentagon is oriented counter-clockwise, then from V2 to V5 along the long way is +144°? Angular separation.\\nIf vertices at angles φ_k, then the angular separation for arc of k steps is k*72°.\\nShorter arc between V2 and V5 is min(3*72°, 2*72°) = min(216°, 144°) = 144°, so the minor arc is 144°, which corresponds to 2 steps.\\nIn counter-clockwise direction, if V2 at angle α, V5 at α + 144° or α - 144°, but since 144<180, it's minor arc.\\nIn our setting, the vector from V2 to V5 is (d,0), so the direction is 0°.\\nFrom V2 to V5, the vector is (d,0), so if we consider the displacement.\\nIn the circle, the chord from V2 to V5.\\nThe center O_c, the angle at O_c is 144°, as set.\\nThe position.\\nSuppose we go from V2 to V5 along the minor arc of 144°.\\nThis arc could be clockwise or counter-clockwise.\\nIn the pentagon, the vertices are ordered, so the minor arc should contain the vertices in order.\\nFor example, if minor arc is counter-clockwise from V2 to V5, then it should pass through V3 and V4? But V2 to V3 to V4 to V5 is three steps, 216°, which is major arc.\\nMinor arc of 144° should be two steps, so it should be V2 to V1 to V5 or something.\\nIn our labeling, the sequence is V1,V2,V3,V4,V5, so if counter-clockwise, V1 to V2 to V3 etc.\\nSo from V2 to V5, counter-clockwise: V2-V3-V4-V5, three steps, 216°\\nClockwise: V2-V1-V5, two steps, 144°\\nSo the minor arc (144°) is clockwise from V2 to V5.\\nTherefore, in the circle, from V2 to V5 clockwise is 144°.\\nSo the center O_c is such that the angle V2 O_c V5 is 144°, and the arc is clockwise.\\nIn terms of position, with V2 at (0,0), V5 at (d,0), the center O_c is located such that the vector from O_c to V2 and O_c to V5 have angle 144° between them, and since the arc is clockwise, O_c should be below the chord V2V5 if we assume standard position.\\nIn the triangle, with V2(0,0), V5(d,0), O_c on the perpendicular bisector x=d/2, and since the angle at O_c is 144° >90°, and for the arc to be clockwise, likely O_c is below the x-axis.\\nLet's calculate.\\nThe distance O_c to V2 is R, O_c to V5 is R.\\nLet O_c be at (d/2, h)\\nThen distance to V2: sqrt( (d/2 - 0)^2 + (h - 0)^2 ) = sqrt( (d/2)^2 + h^2 ) = R\\nSimilarly to V5: same by symmetry.\\nNow, the angle at O_c: the vectors from O_c to V2: (-d/2, -h)\\nFrom O_c to V5: (d/2, -h)  [since V5(d,0), O_c(d/2,h), so (d - d/2, 0 - h) = (d/2, -h)]\\nDot product: (-d/2)(d/2) + (-h)(-h) = -d²/4 + h²\\nMagnitude each: R, so dot product = R^2 cos(angle)\\nAngle is 144°, cos144° = -cos36° = - (√5 +1)/4\\nSo:\\n- d²/4 + h² = R^2 * [ - (√5 +1)/4 ]\\nBut R^2 = (d/2)^2 + h^2 = d²/4 + h²\\nSo:\\n- d²/4 + h² = (d²/4 + h²) * [ - (√5 +1)/4 ]\\nLet u = h², v = d²\\nSo:\\n- v/4 + u = (v/4 + u) * [ - (√5 +1)/4 ]\\nLet k = (√5 +1)/4\\nSo:\\n- v/4 + u = -k (v/4 + u)\\nBring all to one side:\\nu - v/4 + k v/4 + k u = 0\\nu(1 + k) + v(-1/4 + k/4) = 0\\nu(1+k) = v(1/4 - k/4) = (v/4)(1 - k)\\nSo u = [ (v/4)(1 - k) ] / (1 + k)\\nNow k = (√5 +1)/4\\n1 - k = 1 - (√5 +1)/4 = (4 - √5 -1)/4 = (3 - √5)/4\\n1 + k = 1 + (√5 +1)/4 = (4 + √5 +1)/4 = (5 + √5)/4\\nSo u = [ (v/4) * (3 - √5)/4 ] / [ (5 + √5)/4 ] = (v/4) * (3 - √5)/4 * 4/(5 + √5) = (v/4) * (3 - √5)/(5 + √5)\\nRationalize or simplify.\\nNote that (3 - √5)/(5 + √5) * (5 - √5)/(5 - √5) = [ (3 - √5)(5 - √5) ] / (25 - 5) = [15 -3√5 -5√5 +5] / 20 = (20 -8√5)/20 = (5 -2√5)/5\\nCalculate:\\n(3 - √5)(5 - √5) = 3*5 =15, 3*(-√5)= -3√5, -√5*5= -5√5, (-√5)(-√5)=5, so 15+5=20, -3-5= -8√5, so 20 - 8√5\\nDenominator (5+√5)(5-√5)=25-5=20\\nSo (20 - 8√5)/20 = 1 - (2/5)√5\\nSo u = (v/4) * (1 - (2/5)√5) = (d²/4) (1 - (2/5)√5)\\nBut earlier from R^2 = d²/4 + h² = d²/4 + u, and R = d/(2 sin72°), but perhaps keep.\\nFrom earlier geometric, h = O_c M = R cos(72°), and R = d/(2 sin72°), so |h| = [d/(2 sin72°)] cos72° = (d/2) cot72°\\nAnd cot72° = tan18° = 2 - √5? Standard values.\\nSin72° = 2 sin36° cos36° = 2 * [√(10-2√5)}/4] * [(√5+1)/4], but known that sin72° = cos18° = √(10 + 2√5)/4 or something.\\nActually, sin72° = 2 sin36° cos36° = 2 * [√(10 - 2√5)}/4] * [(√5+1)/4] wait, better recall:\\ncos36° = (√5 +1)/4\\nsin36° = √(1 - cos²36°) = √[1 - ((√5+1)/4)^2] = √[1 - (6 +2√5)/16] = √[(16 -6 -2√5)/16] = √[(10 -2√5)/16] = (1/4) √(10 -2√5)\\nThen sin72° = 2 sin36° cos36° = 2 * (1/4)√(10-2√5) * (√5+1)/4 = (1/8) (√5+1) √(10-2√5)\\nThis is messy.\\nNumerically: sin72° ≈ 0.9511, cos72° ≈ 0.3090, so cot72° ≈ 0.3090/0.9511 ≈ 0.3249\\nBut perhaps keep symbolic.\\ncot72° = cos72°/sin72° = [ (√5 -1)/4 ] / [ √(10 + 2√5)/4 ] wait.\\nActually, cos72° = sin18° = (√5 -1)/4\\nSin72° = cos18° = √(1 - sin²18°) = √[1 - ((√5-1)/4)^2] = √[1 - (5 -2√5 +1)/16] = √[1 - (6 -2√5)/16] = √[(16 -6 +2√5)/16] = √[(10 +2√5)/16] = (1/4) √(10 +2√5)\\nSo cot72° = cos72°/sin72° = [ (√5 -1)/4 ] / [ (1/4) √(10 +2√5) ] = (√5 -1) / √(10 +2√5)\\nRationalize or simplify: note that (√5 -1)^2 = 5 -2√5 +1 =6 -2√5\\n10 +2√5, not obvious.\\nLeave as (d/2) cot72° for now.\\nBut from earlier, in the dot product, we have the sign.\\nFrom the dot product equation:\\n- d²/4 + h² = R^2 cos144° = R^2 ( - cos36°) = - R^2 (√5 +1)/4\\nAnd R^2 = (d/2)^2 + h^2 = d²/4 + h²\\nSo - d²/4 + h² = - (d²/4 + h²) (√5 +1)/4\\nLet S = d²/4 + h² = R^2\\nThen - d²/4 + h² = - S (√5 +1)/4\\nBut - d²/4 + h² = ( - d²/4 - h²) + 2h² = -S + 2h²\\nSo -S + 2h² = - S (√5 +1)/4\\nBring to left: -S + 2h² + S (√5 +1)/4 = 0\\n2h² + S [ -1 + (√5 +1)/4 ] = 0\\n2h² = S [1 - (√5 +1)/4] = S [ (4 - √5 -1)/4 ] = S (3 - √5)/4\\nSo h² = (S/2) * (3 - √5)/4 = S (3 - √5)/8\\nBut S = d²/4 + h², so this is circular, but we can solve.\\nFrom h² = [ (d²/4 + h²) ] (3 - √5)/8\\nLet u = h²\\nu = (3 - √5)/8 * (d²/4 + u) = (3 - √5)/8 * d²/4 + (3 - √5)/8 u = (3 - √5) d² / 32 + (3 - √5)/8 u\\nSo u - (3 - √5)/8 u = (3 - √5) d² / 32\\nu [1 - (3 - √5)/8] = (3 - √5) d² / 32\\nu [ (8 - (3 - √5)) / 8 ] = (3 - √5) d² / 32\\nu [ (5 + √5) / 8 ] = (3 - √5) d² / 32\\nSo u = [ (3 - √5) d² / 32 ] * [ 8 / (5 + √5) ] = (3 - √5) d² / (4 (5 + √5)) \\nRationalize denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by 5 - √5\\nNumerator: (3 - √5)(5 - √5) = 15 -3√5 -5√5 +5 = 20 -8√5\\nDenominator: 4 (25 - 5) = 4*20 = 80\\nSo u = (20 -8√5)/80 = (5 -2√5)/20 = d² (5 -2√5)/20\\nSo h = d √(5 -2√5)/√20 = (d /(2√5)) √(5 -2√5) , but perhaps keep h^2 = d^2 (5 -2√5)/20\\nNow, the sign: for the angle to be 144°, and since cos is negative, and in the dot product (-d/2)(d/2) + (-h)(-h) = -d²/4 + h², and this equals R^2 cos144° <0, so -d²/4 + h² <0, so h² < d²/4, which is true since (5-2*2.236)/20≈ (5-4.472)/20=0.528/20=0.0264, while d²/4=0.25, so yes.\\nNow, for the arc to be clockwise, and since the pentagon is convex, likely h <0, so O_c is below the x-axis.\\nIn our case, for the minor arc to be clockwise from V2 to V5, and V2 at (0,0), V5 at (d,0), so from left to right, clockwise arc would be below, so O_c should have negative y-coordinate, so h <0.\\nSo we take h = - d √( (5 -2√5)/20 ) = - (d /(2√5)) √(5 -2√5) , but symbolically, h = - d * sqrt( (5 -2√5)/20 ) \\nNow, once we have O_c at (d/2, h) with h<0, then the vertices.\\nV2 is at (0,0), which is vector from O_c: (-d/2, -h) since h<0, -h>0\\nThe angle of this vector.\\nThen V3 is the next vertex in the pentagon.\\nSince the pentagon is oriented, and from V2 to V3, in the sequence, if it's V1,V2,V3,V4,V5, and we have minor arc V2 to V5 clockwise, which is V2-V1-V5, so the order around the circle is V2, then V1, then V5, then V4, then V3, or something.\\nFrom V2 to V5 clockwise: V2 to V1 to V5, so the order is V2, V1, V5, then continuing, V4, V3, back to V2.\\nSo the cyclic order is V2, V1, V5, V4, V3, V2.\\nSo from V2, next is V1, then V5, etc.\\nBut we want V3, which is after V4.\\nFrom V2, in clockwise direction, next is V1.\\nBut we need V3, which is two steps before V2 in clockwise, or in counter-clockwise.\\nFrom the list, after V2 is V1 (clockwise), then V5, V4, V3, then back.\\nSo V3 is three steps clockwise from V2, or two steps counter-clockwise.\\nAngularly, from V2, V3 is at an angle corresponding to -144° or +216°, but since 216>180, the smaller angle is -144°.\\nThe angular separation is min| i-j| *72° = for |2-3|=1, so 72°, but in which direction.\\nFrom the cyclic order, from V2 to V3, if we go V2 to V3 directly, in the boundary it's not direct, but in the circle, the short arc is 72°.\\nFrom the order V2, V1, V5, V4, V3, V2, so from V2 to V3, the short way is V2 to V3 directly? But in the sequence, it's not consecutive; V2 is adjacent to V1 and V3 in the polygon? In our labeling, V2 is adjacent to V1 and V3, yes, because edges V1-V2 and V2-V3.\\nIn the polygon V1-V2-V3-V4-V5-V1, so V2 is adjacent to V1 and V3.\\nSo in the circle, V2 and V3 are adjacent vertices, so angular separation 72°.\\nIn the cyclic order we have V2, then V1, then V5, then V4, then V3, then back to V2, so from V2 to V1 is +72°? Let's assign angles.\\nSuppose we set V2 at angle 0.\\nThen since next in clockwise is V1, so V1 at -72° (or 288°)\\nThen V5 at -144° (216°)\\nThen V4 at -216° (144°)\\nThen V3 at -288° (72°)\\nThen back to V2 at -360°=0°.\\nSo V3 at 72°.\\nSo in this case, with clockwise order, V3 is at +72° from V2.\\nAngles from center.\\nSo if V2 is at angle α, then V3 is at α + 72°.\\nIn our case, with O_c at (d/2, h), V2 at (0,0), so the vector from O_c to V2 is (-d/2, -h)\\nSo the angle of this vector is atan2(-h, -d/2)\\nSince h<0, -h>0, -d/2<0, so second quadrant.\\nLet β = atan2(-h, -d/2)\\nThen V3 is at angle β + 72° from O_c.\\nSo coordinates of V3: O_c + R * (cos(β + 72°), sin(β + 72°))\\nBut R and β are known in terms of d.\\nSince we have the vector, we can compute.\\nLet \\vec{OV2} = (-d/2, -h)\\nThen \\vec{OV3} = rotate \\vec{OV2} by +72° around O_c.\\nRotation by φ: (x cosφ - y sinφ, x sinφ + y cosφ)\\nSo \\vec{OV3} = ( (-d/2) cos72° - (-h) sin72°, (-d/2) sin72° + (-h) cos72° ) = ( - (d/2) cos72° + h sin72°, - (d/2) sin72° - h cos72° )\\nThen coordinates of V3 = O_c + \\vec{OV3} = (d/2, h) + ( - (d/2) cos72° + h sin72°, - (d/2) sin72° - h cos72° ) = ( d/2 - (d/2) cos72° + h sin72°, h - (d/2) sin72° - h cos72° ) = (d/2)(1 - cos72°) + h sin72°, h(1 - cos72°) - (d/2) sin72° )\\nNow plug in the values.\\n cos72° = (√5 -1)/4\\n sin72° = √(10 +2√5)/4, but use numerical for simplicity, or keep symbolic.\\nNote that h = - d * sqrt( (5 -2√5)/20 ) from earlier, but it's messy.\\nSince we know that in the pentagon, the distance from V2 to V3 is p, and we have d = p φ, so p = d / φ = d * 2/(1+√5) = d (2/(1+√5)) * (√5-1)/(√5-1) = d * 2(√5-1)/(5-1) = d * 2(√5-1)/4 = d (√5-1)/2\\nAnd the angle at V2 between V2V5 and V2V3.\\nIn triangle V2V3V5, we have V2V3 = p, V2V5 = d, V3V5 = ? In pentagon, V3 to V5: |3-5|=2, so also diagonal, so V3V5 = d also, since all diagonals equal.\\nSo triangle V2V3V5 is isosceles with V2V3 = p, V2V5 = d, V3V5 = d\\nV2V3 = p, V2V5 = d, V3V5 = distance between V3 and V5.\\n|3-5|=2, so yes, separated by one vertex, so diagonal, length d.\\nSo triangle V2V3V5 has sides V2V3 = p, V2V5 = d, V3V5 = d\\nSo isosceles with V2V5 = V3V5 = d, base V2V3 = p\\nThen the angle at V2 can be found.\\nBy law of cosines:\\n cos angle at V2 = ( V2V3^2 + V2V5^2 - V3V5^2 ) / (2 * V2V3 * V2V5) = (p^2 + d^2 - d^2) / (2 p d) = p^2 / (2 p d) = p/(2d)\\nBut p = d / φ = d * 2/(1+√5) = d (√5-1)/2, as above.\\nSo cos angle = [d (√5-1)/2] / (2d) = (√5-1)/4 = cos72°\\nSo angle at V2 is 72°.\\nNow, in the plane, with V2 at (0,0), V5 at (d,0), then V3 is at distance p from V2, and the angle between vectors V2 to V5 and V2 to V3 is 72°.\\nSo the direction of V2 to V3.\\nIt can be at +72° or -72° from the vector V2 to V5.\\nVector V2 to V5 is (d,0), so direction 0°.\\nSo V2 to V3 can be at angle 72° or -72°.\\nNow, in the pentagon, which one? From earlier, in our cyclic order, it should be consistent.\\nIf we take +72°, then V3 at (p cos72°, p sin72°)\\nIf -72°, at (p cos(-72°), p sin(-72°)) = (p cos72°, -p sin72°)\\nNow, in our earlier determination, with the minor arc clockwise, and V3 at 72° in global angle, but let's see the position relative to V5.\\nFor example, if V3 at (p cos72°, p sin72°), with p = d (√5-1)/2, cos72°=(√5-1)/4, etc.\\nBut also, distance to V5 should be d.\\nLet me verify.\\nSuppose V3 at (p cos72°, p sin72°)\\nV5 at (d,0)\\nDistance squared: (d - p cos72°)^2 + (0 - p sin72°)^2 = d^2 - 2d p cos72° + p^2 cos^2 72° + p^2 sin^2 72° = d^2 - 2d p cos72° + p^2\\nNow p = d (√5-1)/2, cos72° = (√5-1)/4\\nSo p cos72° = [d (√5-1)/2] * [(√5-1)/4] = d (5 -2√5 +1)/8 = d (6 -2√5)/8 = d (3 - √5)/4\\nThen -2d p cos72° = -2d * d (3 - √5)/4 = - (d^2 /2) (3 - √5)\\np^2 = [d (√5-1)/2]^2 = d^2 (5 -2√5 +1)/4 = d^2 (6 -2√5)/4 = d^2 (3 - √5)/2\\nSo total: d^2 - (d^2 /2)(3 - √5) + d^2 (3 - √5)/2 = d^2 + d^2 (3 - √5)/2 * (-1 + 1) = d^2 + 0 = d^2\\nSo distance = d, good for both choices? This is for the +72° case.\\nFor the -72° case, same thing since sin^2.\\nSo both are mathematically possible, but in the pentagon, only one is correct based on the order.\\nIn our case, with the minor arc from V2 to V5 being clockwise, and V3 should not be on that arc.\\nIf we take V3 at +72°, so above, then the arc from V2 to V5 clockwise would be below, so V3 is not on it, good.\\nIf we take V3 at -72°, below, then it might be on the arc or not.\\nIn the minor arc clockwise from V2 to V5, which is below if we assume, then if V3 is below, it might be on the arc, but in the pentagon, the minor arc should be V2-V1-V5, not including V3, so V3 should not be on the minor arc, so it should be on the other side, so above, so we should take the +72° option.\\nSo V3 at (p cos72°, p sin72°)\\nWith p = d (√5-1)/2, cos72° = (√5-1)/4, sin72° = sqrt(1 - cos^2 72°) = sqrt(1 - ((√5-1)/4)^2) = sqrt(1 - (5-2√5+1)/16) = sqrt(1 - (6-2√5)/16) = sqrt((16-6+2√5)/16) = sqrt((10+2√5)/16) = (1/4) sqrt(10+2√5)\\nBut we can leave.\\nSo coordinates of V3 in local coord: ( p cos72°, p sin72° ) = ( [d (√5-1)/2] * [(√5-1)/4], [d (√5-1)/2] * sin72° ) = ( d (5 -2√5 +1)/8, ... ) = ( d (6 -2√5)/8, ...) = ( d (3 - √5)/4, p sin72° )\\nNow back to global coord.\\nIn this case, for the hexagon, we have E at (-√3 s, 0), I at (s,0), so in local coord for pentagon, we set E at (0,0), I at (d,0) = (s(1+√3), 0)\\nBut E is V2, I is V5, so V3 is N.\\nSo N is at ( p cos72°, p sin72° ) in local coord with origin at E.\\nSo in global coord, N = E + ( p cos72°, p sin72° ) = (-√3 s, 0) + ( p cos72°, p sin72° )\\nAnd p = d (√5-1)/2 = s(1+√3) (√5-1)/2\\nCos72° = (√5-1)/4\\nSo p cos72° = [s(1+√3) (√5-1)/2] * [(√5-1)/4] = s(1+√3) (5 -2√5 +1)/8 = s(1+√3) (6 -2√5)/8 = s(1+√3) (3 - √5)/4\\nSimilarly, p sin72° = [s(1+√3) (√5-1)/2] * sin72°\\nNow O is at (0,0) in global coord.\\nSo ON = distance from O(0,0) to N( -√3 s + p cos72°, p sin72° )\\nThis is complicated, and we have another choice for E.\\nMoreover, for each, we have the choice of the pentagon orientation, but in this case we chose the upper one.\\nBut there might be a lower one, but in our reasoning, we took the one not on the minor arc.\\nFor the other choice of E.\\nRecall that for the hexagon, we have two possible E: at (-√3 s, 0) or at (√3 s, 0)\\nWe did first.\\nSecond case: E at (√3 s, 0)\\nThen EI = |s - √3 s| = s|1 - √3| = s(√3 -1) since √3>1\\nThen d = EI = s(√3 -1)\\nThen p = d (√5-1)/2 = s(√3 -1) (√5-1)/2\\nThen in local coord, E at (0,0), I at (d,0) = (s(√3-1),0)\\nThen N at (p cos72°, p sin72°) or possibly (p cos72°, -p sin72°), but again, we need to choose the correct side.\\nWith minor arc from E to I.\\nDistance d = s(√3-1) ≈ s(1.732-1)=0.732s\\nAngular separation 144°, same as before.\\nVector from E to I is (d,0), same.\\nMinor arc: since |i-j|=2 in index, minor arc 144°.\\nIn the pentagon, minor arc should be the shorter path, which is two edges, so not including N if N is not on it.\\nSimilar to before, we can take N above or below.\\nTo be consistent, likely we take the same relative orientation, so N at (p cos72°, p sin72°) in local coord.\\nThen in global, N = E + (p cos72°, p sin72°) = (√3 s, 0) + (p cos72°, p sin72°)\\nThen ON = distance to (0,0)\\nNow, additionally, for each choice of E, and for each, we might have the choice of the pentagon being reflected, i.e., N below, but in our earlier reasoning for the first case, we chose above to avoid the minor arc, but actually for the distance ON, it might give different values, but since the plane is symmetric, and O is on the x-axis, the distance might be the same for upper and lower if we take absolute value, but let's see.\\nFor a given E and I, if we place N above or below, then distance to O(0,0) may be different because O is not on the perpendicular bisector.\\nIn the first case, E at (-√3 s,0), I at (s,0), midpoint at (s(1-√3)/2, 0) ≈ s(1-1.732)/2 = s(-0.366), while O at (0,0), not symmetric.\\nSo the two positions for N (above and below) will give different distances to O.\\nHowever, in the context of the polygon, only one orientation may be valid based on the shared vertices and the plane, but since no other constraints, probably both are allowed, as long as the polygon is embedded without intersection, but likely both are valid.\\nBut in our earlier choice, we selected one based on the arc, but actually for the existence, both might be possible, but perhaps in this configuration, with the hexagon already placed, and the pentagon attached, both orientations might be possible unless it causes conflict, but since no other shared points, probably both are allowed.\\nTo save time, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the number of possible values, and likely it's small.\\nPerhaps for each choice of E, and for each choice of pentagon orientation, we get a value, but some may coincide.\\nMoreover, we have the initial choice for the square: we assumed A at (0,s), but could be at (0,-s)\\nWe forgot that.\\nAt the beginning, when we set O at (0,0), I at (s,0), then A could be at (0,s) or (0,-s)\\nWe took (0,s), but (0,-s) is also possible.\\nSo two choices for the square's orientation.\\nFor each, the hexagon will have corresponding E positions.\\nBut by symmetry, if we reflect over x-axis, everything flips, and distances may be the same, so ON might be the same.\\nSo perhaps the values repeat.\\nTo find the number of possible values of ON, given IN=1.\\nPerhaps compute ON in terms of s, then use IN=1 to find s, then ON.\\nBut IN is given as 1, and IN is a distance in the pentagon.\\nIn the pentagon, IN is the distance between I and N.\\nI is V5, N is V3, |5-3|=2, so again, separated by one vertex, so distance is the diagonal d_p = p φ, where p is side of pentagon.\\nBut in our case, for each configuration, we have p in terms of s, and s is scale, but IN is given as 1, so we can solve for s, then find ON.\\nBut ON will depend on the configuration.\\nLet's try to compute for one case.\\nTake the first choice: square with A at (0,s), so O(0,0), I(s,0), A(0,s)\\nHexagon with E at (-√3 s, 0)  (one of the two choices)\\nThen d_EI = distance E to I = |s - (-√3 s)| = s(1+√3)\\nThis is the distance between E and I, which in the pentagon is the diagonal, so d_EI = p * φ = p * (1+√5)/2\\nSo p = d_EI * 2 / (1+√5) = s(1+√3) * 2 / (1+√5)\\nRationalize: 2 / (1+√5) * (√5-1)/(√5-1) = 2(√5-1)/(5-1) = 2(√5-1)/4 = (√5-1)/2\\nSo p = s(1+√3) * (√5-1)/2\\nNow, in the pentagon, distance IN: I to N.\\nI is V5, N is V3, |5-3|=2, so again, diagonal, so IN = p * φ = p * (1+√5)/2\\nBut p = s(1+√3) (√5-1)/2, so IN = [s(1+√3) (√5-1)/2] * (1+√5)/2 = s(1+√3) (√5-1)(1+√5) / 4\\nCompute (√5-1)(1+√5) = √5*1 +5 -1 -√5 = 5 -1 =4? Let's see: (a-b)(c+d) = ac+ad-bc-bd\\n(√5)(1) = √5, (√5)(√5)=5, (-1)(1)= -1, (-1)(√5)= -√5, so √5 +5 -1 -√5 = 4\\nYes, so IN = s(1+√3) * 4 / 4 = s(1+√3)\\nBut earlier d_EI = s(1+√3), and IN = s(1+√3), so IN = d_EI = s(1+√3)\\nIs that possible? In the pentagon, both EI and IN are diagonals, so yes, all diagonals equal, so IN = EI = s(1+√3)\\nGiven that IN = 1, so s(1+√3) = 1, thus s = 1/(1+√3) = (√3 -1)/2 after rationalizing.\\nNow, we need ON.\\nO is at (0,0), N is to be found.\\nIn the pentagon, with E and I fixed, and we need to place N.\\nAs above, N can be at two positions: above or below the line EI.\\nLine EI is from E(-√3 s,0) to I(s,0), which is the x-axis in our coord.\\nSo N can have positive or negative y-coordinate.\\nNow, the distance from I to N is IN=1, and from E to N is EN, which in pentagon, E to N: |2-3|=1, so adjacent, so EN = p, the side length.\\np = s(1+√3) (√5-1)/2 = 1 * (√5-1)/2, since s(1+√3)=1\\nSo p = (√5-1)/2\\nNow, to find coordinates of N.\\nWith E at (-√3 s, 0), I at (s,0), and IN=1, EN=p=(√5-1)/2\\nSo N is at intersection of circle center I radius 1, and circle center E radius p.\\nCircle 1: (x - s)^2 + y^2 = 1^2 =1\\nCircle 2: (x + √3 s)^2 + y^2 = p^2\\nSubtract: (x + √3 s)^2 - (x - s)^2 = p^2 - 1\\nExpand: (x^2 + 2√3 s x + 3 s^2) - (x^2 -2s x + s^2) = 2√3 s x + 3s^2 +2s x - s^2 = x s (2√3 +2) + 2s^2 = 2s x (√3 +1) + 2s^2\\nSet equal to p^2 - 1\\nBut p = (√5-1)/2, p^2 = [(√5-1)/2]^2 = (5 -2√5 +1)/4 = (6-2√5)/4 = (3-√5)/2\\nSo p^2 - 1 = (3-√5)/2 - 1 = (3-√5 -2)/2 = (1-√5)/2\\nLeft side: 2s x (1+√3) + 2s^2\\nBut s(1+√3) =1, so 2s x (1+√3) = 2x * [s(1+√3)] = 2x * 1 = 2x\\n2s^2 = 2s * s = 2s * [1/(1+√3)] = 2s (√3-1)/2 = s(√3-1)  (since 1/(1+√3) = (√3-1)/(3-1) = (√3-1)/2)\\ns = (√3-1)/2, so 2s^2 = 2 * [(√3-1)/2]^2 = 2 * (3 -2√3 +1)/4 = 2 * (4 -2√3)/4 = 2 * (2 - √3)/2 = 2 - √3? Let's compute:\\ns = (√3-1)/2\\ns^2 = (3 -2√3 +1)/4 = (4 -2√3)/4 = (2 - √3)/2\\nSo 2s^2 = 2 * (2 - √3)/2 = 2 - √3\\nSo left side: 2x + (2 - √3)\\nSet equal to p^2 - 1 = (1-√5)/2\\nSo 2x + 2 - √3 = (1-√5)/2\\nThus 2x = (1-√5)/2 - 2 + √3 = (1-√5 -4 + 2√3)/2 = (-3 -√5 +2√3)/2\\nSo x = [-3 -√5 +2√3]/4\\nThen from (x - s)^2 + y^2 =1, we can find y^2, but for distance to O(0,0), ON^2 = x^2 + y^2\\nFrom the circle equation, (x - s)^2 + y^2 =1, so x^2 -2s x + s^2 + y^2 =1, so x^2 + y^2 = 1 +2s x - s^2\\nSo ON^2 = 1 +2s x - s^2\\nWe have x, s in terms of radicals.\\ns = (√3-1)/2\\nx = [-3 -√5 +2√3]/4\\nSo 2s x = 2 * (√3-1)/2 * [-3 -√5 +2√3]/4 = (√3-1) * [-3 -√5 +2√3]/4\\nCompute (√3-1)(-3 -√5 +2√3) = √3*(-3) = -3√3, √3*(-√5)= -√15, √3*2√3=2*3=6, -1*(-3)=3, -1*(-√5)=√5, -1*2√3= -2√3\\nSo altogether: -3√3 -√15 +6 +3 +√5 -2√3 = (6+3) + (-3-2)√3 + √5 -√15 = 9 -5√3 + √5 -√15\\nThen divide by 4: (9 -5√3 + √5 -√15)/4\\ns^2 = (2 - √3)/2 as above\\nSo ON^2 = 1 + [ (9 -5√3 + √5 -√15)/4 ] - (2 - √3)/2\\nConvert to fourths: 1 = 4/4, (2 - √3)/2 = (4 - 2√3)/4\\nSo ON^2 = 4/4 + (9 -5√3 + √5 -√15)/4 - (4 - 2√3)/4 = [4 + 9 -5√3 + √5 -√15 -4 + 2√3]/4 = [9 -3√3 + √5 -√15]/4\\nThis is for one choice of N (say upper), but we have y^2, so for each x, there are two y, but in this case, from the subtraction, we have x, then y^2 from the equation, but in this calculation, we have ON^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 1 +2s x - s^2, which is determined, so for both upper and lower N, ON is the same, since it depends on x^2 + y^2, and for fixed x, y^2 is fixed, so ON is the same for both positions of N (above and below).\\nIs that true? ON^2 = x^2 + y^2, and from the circle, for fixed x, y^2 is determined, so yes, for both choices of y-sign, ON is the same.\\nSo for this configuration, ON is unique.\\nNow, this is for E at (-√3 s,0) and s(1+√3)=1.\\nNow, similarly, for the other choice of E: at (√3 s, 0)\\nThen d_EI = |s - √3 s| = s|1 - √3| = s(√3 -1)\\nThen IN = distance I to N, which is diagonal, so IN = p φ, but p = side, and d_EI = distance E to I = also diagonal, since |2-5|=2, so d_EI = p φ, so IN = d_EI = s(√3 -1)\\nGiven IN=1, so s(√3 -1) =1, thus s = 1/(√3 -1) = (√3 +1)/2 after rationalizing.\\nNow, then ON can be computed similarly.\\nN is at intersection of circle center I(s,0) radius IN=1, and circle center E(√3 s, 0) radius EN=p.\\nEN = p, since E and N adjacent, |2-3|=1.\\np = d_EI / φ = IN / φ = 1 / φ = 2/(1+√5) = (2/(1+√5)) * (√5-1)/(√5-1) = 2(√5-1)/(5-1) = (2√5-2)/4 = (√5-1)/2, same as before.\\nSo p = (√5-1)/2\\nNow, circle 1: (x - s)^2 + y^2 = 1\\nCircle 2: (x - √3 s)^2 + y^2 = p^2\\nSubtract: (x - √3 s)^2 - (x - s)^2 = p^2 - 1\\nLeft: (x^2 -2√3 s x + 3 s^2) - (x^2 -2s x + s^2) = -2√3 s x + 3s^2 +2s x - s^2 = 2s x (1 - √3) + 2s^2\\nRight: p^2 -1 = (3-√5)/2 -1 = (1-√5)/2, same as before.\\nNow s(√3 -1) =1, so s = 1/(√3 -1) = (√3 +1)/2\\n2s x (1 - √3) = 2x s (1 - √3) = 2x * [ - s (√3 -1) ] = 2x * (-1) = -2x  (since s(√3-1)=1)\\n2s^2 = 2 * [(√3+1)/2]^2 = 2 * (3 +2√3 +1)/4 = 2 * (4+2√3)/4 = 2 * (2+√3)/2 = 2+√3\\nSo left side: -2x + 2 + √3\\nSet equal to (1-√5)/2\\nSo -2x + 2 + √3 = (1-√5)/2\\nThus -2x = (1-√5)/2 -2 - √3 = (1-√5 -4 -2√3)/2 = (-3 -√5 -2√3)/2\\nSo 2x = (3 +√5 +2√3)/2\\nx = (3 +√5 +2√3)/4\\nThen ON^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 1 +2s x - s^2  (from (x-s)^2 + y^2=1)\\n2s x = 2 * (√3+1)/2 * (3 +√5 +2√3)/4 = (√3+1) (3 +√5 +2√3)/4\\nCompute (√3+1)(3 +√5 +2√3) = √3*3=3√3, √3*√5=√15, √3*2√3=6, 1*3=3, 1*√5=√5, 1*2√3=2√3, so total: 3√3 + √15 +6 +3 + √5 +2√3 = 9 + 5√3 + √5 + √15\\nThen divide by 4: (9 +5√3 + √5 + √15)/4\\ns^2 = [(√3+1)/2]^2 = (3 +2√3 +1)/4 = (4+2√3)/4 = (2+√3)/2\\nSo ON^2 = 1 + (9 +5√3 + √5 + √15)/4 - (2+√3)/2 = 4/4 + (9 +5√3 + √5 + √15)/4 - (4+2√3)/4 = [4 +9 +5√3 + √5 + √15 -4 -2√3]/4 = [9 +3√3 + √5 + √15]/4\\nCompare to earlier for the first case: ON^2 = [9 -3√3 + √5 -√15]/4\\nDifferent.\\nNow, additionally, we have the choice for the square: we took A at (0,s), but could be at (0,-s)\\nIf we take A at (0,-s), then similarly, the hexagon will have E at (±√3 s, 0) or something, but by symmetry, since the setup is symmetric with respect to x-axis, and O and I on x-axis, likely the values of ON will be the same as when A is at (0,s), because the distance is even in y.\\nFor example, in the first case, when A at (0,s), E at (-√3 s,0), then if we reflect over x-axis, A goes to (0,-s), E goes to (-√3 s,0) same, since on x-axis, so E unchanged, so same configuration.\\nSimilarly for other E.\\nSo no new configurations.\\nNow, for each choice of E, we have a value of ON^2, and thus ON.\\nBut for each, we have two possible N (above and below), but as we saw, ON is the same for both, since ON^2 depends only on x and y^2.\\nSo for each choice of E, we get one value of ON.\\nWe have two choices for E: at (-√3 s,0) or at (√3 s,0)\\nFor first, with s(1+√3)=1, ON^2 = [9 -3√3 + √5 -√15]/4\\nFor second, with s(√3-1)=1, ON^2 = [9 +3√3 + √5 + √15]/4\\nThese are different.\\nMoreover, are there more? We have the pentagon orientation, but as said, it doesn't affect ON.\\nBut in the hexagon, when we chose the position of E, we had two options, and for each, we have a different s, and different ON.\\nBut is that all?\\nEarlier for the hexagon, with A and O fixed, we had two possible E: at (-√3 s, 0) or (√3 s, 0)\\nAnd for each, we proceeded.\\nNow, for each, we have IN=1 determining s, and then ON computed.\\nSo two possible values for ON.\\nBut let's confirm the values.\\nFirst configuration: E at (-√3 s,0), s(1+√3)=1, so s=1/(1+√3)=(√3-1)/2\\nON^2 = [9 -3√3 + √5 -√15]/4\\nSecond: E at (√3 s,0), s(√3-1)=1, s=(√3+1)/2\\nON^2 = [9 +3√3 + √5 + √15]/4\\nNow, are these positive? Yes.\\nAnd different.\\nNow, is there a third possibility? For example, if we consider the other orientation of the pentagon, but as said, it gives the same ON for fixed E and I.\\nOr if we consider that in the pentagon, the labeling might be different, but likely not.\\nAnother thing: in the hexagon, when we placed it, we assumed the order, but we had only two choices for E, both covered.\\nSimilarly for square.\\nSo probably two possible values for ON.\\nBut the problem asks for the number of possible values, not the values themselves.\\nSo answer should be 2.\\nBut let's make sure that in both cases, the polygons are properly formed and no conflict.\\nFor example, in the first case, with E at (-√3 s,0), s>0, so E has x<0, I at s>0, so fine.\\nPentagon attached, no issue.\\nSimilarly for the other.\\nAnd IN=1 in both cases by construction.\\nSo two possible values.\\nBut earlier in Problem 1, we have answer 6106, and for Problem 2, likely 2.\\nBut let's box.\\nSo final answers.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6106\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\"\n}",
