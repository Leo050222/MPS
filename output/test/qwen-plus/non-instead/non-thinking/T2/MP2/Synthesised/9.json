  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Instead of determining the number of partitions of the set into pairs that form a single cell, simply find $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game. What is the probability that exactly $k$ games will need to be played to determine a winner?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given a multi-part problem that connects combinatorics and probability. Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\n### Step 1: Understand the 2-configuration part\\n\\nWe are told:\\n\\n- A consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair.\\n- The pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of set $ A $.\\n- We are to find $ k = n + 5 $, where $ n $ is the cardinality of set $ A $ that admits such a configuration.\\n\\nSince the configuration has exactly one cell and consists of exactly one pair, and the pairs form a partition of $ A $, this means the entire set $ A $ is partitioned into one pair. \\n\\nA pair contains 2 elements, so $ n = 2 $.\\n\\nThus, $ k = n + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7 $.\\n\\n### Step 2: Best-of-9 series — probability that exactly $ k = 7 $ games are played\\n\\nIn a best-of-9 series, the first team to win 5 games wins the series. We are to compute the probability that **exactly 7 games** are played to determine a winner.\\n\\nFor the series to end in exactly 7 games, one team must win the 7th game and with that win reach exactly 5 wins (i.e., win the series), and have exactly 4 wins in the first 6 games.\\n\\nTwo teams: Mathletes and their opponent.\\n\\nMathletes have a probability of $ \\\\frac{2}{3} $ of winning any game; thus, the opponent has $ \\\\frac{1}{3} $.\\n\\nWe consider two mutually exclusive cases:\\n\\n1. Mathletes win the series in exactly 7 games.\\n2. Opponent wins the series in exactly 7 games.\\n\\n#### Case 1: Mathletes win in 7 games\\n\\n- They must win exactly 4 of the first 6 games, and win game 7.\\n- Number of ways to choose 4 wins in 6 games: $ \\\\binom{6}{4} = 15 $\\n- Probability:  \\n  $ \\\\binom{6}{4} \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\right)^4 \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right)^2 \\\\times \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\right) = 15 \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\right)^5 \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right)^2 $\\n\\n#### Case 2: Opponent wins in 7 games\\n\\n- Opponent must win exactly 4 of the first 6 games, and win game 7.\\n- Number of ways: $ \\\\binom{6}{4} = 15 $\\n- But now the roles are reversed.\\n- Probability:  \\n  $ \\\\binom{6}{4} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right)^4 \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\right)^2 \\\\times \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right) = 15 \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right)^5 \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\right)^2 $\\n\\nNow compute total probability:\\n\\n$$\\nP = 15 \\\\left[ \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\right)^5 \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right)^5 \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\right)^2 \\\\right]\\n$$\\n\\nCompute each term:\\n\\nFirst term:\\n\\n$ \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\right)^5 = \\\\frac{32}{243} $,  \\n$ \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{1}{9} $,  \\nSo first part: $ 15 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{32}{243} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{9} = 15 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{32}{2187} = \\\\frac{480}{2187} $\\n\\nSecond term:\\n\\n$ \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right)^5 = \\\\frac{1}{243} $,  \\n$ \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{4}{9} $,  \\nSo second part: $ 15 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{243} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{4}{9} = 15 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{4}{2187} = \\\\frac{60}{2187} $\\n\\nAdd:\\n\\n$ P = \\\\frac{480 + 60}{2187} = \\\\frac{540}{2187} $\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\nDivide numerator and denominator by 27:\\n\\n540 ÷ 27 = 20, 2187 ÷ 27 = 81? Wait: 27×81=2187 ✔️, 27×20=540 ✔️\\n\\nSo $ \\\\frac{540}{2187} = \\\\frac{20}{81} $\\n\\n### Final Answer\\n\\nThe probability that exactly $ k = 7 $ games are played is $ \\\\frac{20}{81} $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"20/81\"\n}",
