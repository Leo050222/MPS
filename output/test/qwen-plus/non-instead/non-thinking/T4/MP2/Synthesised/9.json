  "math_problem": "Find all integers $n$ satisfying $n \\\\geq 2$ and $\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(n)}{p(n)-1}=n$, in which $\\\\sigma(n)$ denotes the sum of all positive divisors of $n$, and $p(n)$ denotes the largest prime divisor of $n$. Instead of identifying all integers satisfying the condition relating the sum of divisors to the largest prime divisor, simply find $k$, the number of distinct prime factors shared by any such integer. Let $n$ be an integer of the form $a^{2}+b^{2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)=k-1$ and if $p$ is a prime, $p \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{n}$, then $p$ divides $a b$. Determine all such $n$.",
