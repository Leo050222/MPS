  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Since n is a multiple of 2019, let n = 2019m. The equation φ(2019n) = φ(n²) simplifies using prime factorization. 2019 = 3×673. For n = 3^a × 673^b × c (c coprime to 3,673), equating φ(2019n) and φ(n²) leads to constraints a = 1, b = 1, and c = 1. Thus n = 2019. gcd(2019, 2019) = 2019, so k = 2019 - 2018 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Substitute b_n = a_n + 1, transforming the recurrence to b_{n+1} = b_n² / b_{n-1}, a geometric sequence. With a₁ = 1, b₁ = 2. Given a₉ = 7, b₉ = 8. Solving 2r⁸ = 8 gives r⁸ = 4, so r⁴ = 2. Then b₅ = 2r⁴ = 4, so a₅ = 4 - 1 = 3.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
