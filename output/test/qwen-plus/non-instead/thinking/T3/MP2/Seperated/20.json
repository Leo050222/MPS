Substituting gives $p^5 + n^5 = 16pn$. Testing small values, $(p, n) = (2, 2)$ satisfies the equation, yielding $(m, n) = (-2, 2)$. This is the only solution with opposite signs. Here, $n = 2$, so $k = n - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given $pqr = 48$ and $p < q < r$, we minimize $\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$. Using Lagrange multipliers, we find $q = 2p$ and $r = 3p$. Substituting into $pqr = 48$ gives $6p^3 = 48 \\\\Rightarrow p = 2$, so $q = 4$, $r = 6$. The minimum value is $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{3}{2}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
