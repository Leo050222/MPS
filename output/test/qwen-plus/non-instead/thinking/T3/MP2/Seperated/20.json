  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We analyze the equation $m^5 - n^5 = 16mn$. Factoring the left-hand side as $(m - n)(m^4 + m^3n + m^2n^2 + mn^3 + n^4)$, we consider cases where $m$ or $n$ is zero, equal, or non-zero. Testing small values and using substitution reveals that $(0, 0)$ satisfies the equation trivially. For non-zero integers, assuming $m = -k$ and $n = k$ leads to $k^5 + k^5 = 16k^2$, which simplifies to $2k^5 = 16k^2$. Solving gives $k = 2$, so $m = -2$, $n = 2$. Further checks confirm no other integer pairs work. Thus, the solutions are $(0, 0)$ and $(-2, 2)$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using Vieta's formulas, $pqr = 48$ for roots $p < q < r$. To minimize $\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$, we apply Lagrange multipliers with constraint $pqr = 48$. This yields $q = 2p$ and $r = 3p$, leading to $6p^3 = 48$ so $p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$. Substituting gives $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{2}{4} + \\\\frac{3}{6} = \\\\frac{3}{2}$. Testing integer triplets and perturbations confirms this is the minimum.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"[(0, 0), (-2, 2)]\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
