Compute Q(r): Q(-1) = (-1)² + 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2. Then k = Q(r) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Suppose such an irrational α > 1 exists. For n=1, floor(α) must be divisible by 2017, so α ∈ [2017m, 2017m + 1) for some integer m ≥ 1. For large n, αⁿ grows exponentially. The binomial expansion of (2017 + ε)ⁿ (with small ε > 0) shows that the lower-order terms involving ε eventually exceed 1 for sufficiently large n, causing floor(αⁿ) to include a non-multiple of 2017 component. Specifically, for any fixed ε > 0, n*2017^{n-1}ε > 1 for large n, making floor(αⁿ) ≡ non-zero mod 2017. Thus, no such irrational α can satisfy the condition for all n ≥ 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
