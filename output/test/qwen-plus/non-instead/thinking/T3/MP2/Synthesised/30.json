  "math_problem": "For a given positive integer $n$, we define $\\varphi(n)$ to be the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ which share no common prime factors with $n$. Find all positive integers $n$ for which $\\varphi(2019 n)=\\varphi\\left(n^{2}\\right)$. Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ for which $\\varphi(2019 n)=\\varphi(n^2)$, simply find $k=\\gcd(2019,n)-2018$, where $n$ is the positive integer solution that is a multiple of $2019$. The sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$ of real numbers satisfies the recurrence $a_{n+1}=\\frac{a_{n}^{2}-a_{n-1}+2 a_{n}}{a_{n-1}+k}$. Given that $a_{1}=k$ and $a_{9}=7$, find $a_{5}$.",

Then:\\n- $ 2019n = 2019^2 m $\\n- $ n^2 = (2019m)^2 = 2019^2 m^2 $\\n\\nUsing the multiplicative property of Euler's totient function $ \\\\varphi $, we equate:\\n$$\\n\\\\varphi(2019^2 m) = \\\\varphi(2019^2 m^2)\\n$$\\nBreaking into prime components and simplifying leads to the condition that $ m = 1 $. Thus, $ n = 2019 $.\\n\\n**Step 3: Compute $ k $**  \\nSince $ \\\\gcd(2019, 2019) = 2019 $, we have:\\n$$\\nk = 2019 - 2018 = 1\\n$$\\n\\n**Step 4: Solve the recurrence relation**  \\nGiven $ a_{n+1} = \\\\frac{a_n^2 - a_{n-1} + 2a_n}{a_{n-1} + k} $ with $ k = 1 $, $ a_1 = 1 $, and $ a_9 = 7 $.\\n\\nSubstitute $ b_n = a_n + 1 $, transforming the recurrence into:\\n$$\\nb_{n+1} = \\\\frac{b_n^2}{b_{n-1}}\\n$$\\nThis implies $ b_n $ is a geometric sequence. Let $ b_n = 2r^{n-1} $ (since $ b_1 = a_1 + 1 = 2 $).\\n\\nGiven $ a_9 = 7 $, we find $ b_9 = 8 $, so:\\n$$\\n2r^8 = 8 \\\\implies r^8 = 4 \\\\implies r^4 = 2\\n$$\\nThus, $ a_5 = b_5 - 1 = 2r^4 - 1 = 2 \\\\times 2 - 1 = 3 $.\\n\\nVerification confirms the recurrence holds for $ a_5 = 3 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
