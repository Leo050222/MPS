Setting $ x = 1 $ gives $ f(f(y)) = yf(1) $. Let $ c = f(1) $, so $ f(f(y)) = cy $. Injectivity of $ f $ (from equality of outputs implying equality of inputs) leads to $ f(cx) = f(x) $ when $ y = 1 $, hence $ c = 1 $. Verifying with $ f(x) = 1/x $, which satisfies the equation and the limit condition, confirms $ f(1) = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: For $ N = 2^n $, we need the smallest $ a_n $ such that $ \\\\sqrt[N]{\\\\frac{x^{2N} + 1}{2}} \\\\leq a_n(x - 1)^2 + x $ for all real $ x $. Expanding both sides around $ x = 1 $, the second derivative of the left-hand side at $ x = 1 $ is $ N $, while the right-hand side's second derivative is $ 2a_n $. Equating these for tightness gives $ a_n = N/2 = 2^{n-1} $. Testing specific values (e.g., $ N = 2 $) confirms this is minimal, as lower values fail near $ x = 1 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2^{n-1}\"\n}",
