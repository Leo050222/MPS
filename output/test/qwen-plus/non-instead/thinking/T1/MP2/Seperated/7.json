  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The spinner has six regions: four with central angle $x^\\\\circ$ and two with $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$. The total central angle of a circle is $360^\\\\circ$, so $4x + 20 + 140 = 360$. Solving gives $4x = 200$, so $x = 50$. The shaded regions are assumed to be the four regions with $x^\\\\circ$ (as the problem implies computing the shaded angle without specifying which regions, and the four regions are the majority). Thus, the total shaded angle $\\\\theta = 4x = 200^\\\\circ$. Then $N = \\\\theta + 2700 = 200 + 2700 = 2900$.\\n\\nProblem 2: A happy pair $(m, n)$ requires $\\\\gcd(m, n)$ to be a perfect square.
