  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Evaluating discriminant conditions**\n\nI’m analyzing the discriminant D = 4n^3 - 15n^2 + 12n + 4 and determining when it’s greater than or equal to zero and a perfect square. For x to be an integer, D must also be a perfect square. I'm considering symmetry, where y relates to x, and I need to find the smallest positive value of y + 20. This translates to ensuring y > -20. The goal seems to minimize y under these constraints—though I wonder if the set is finite.**Exploring solutions analytically**\n\nI'm considering a brute force approach but realize I need to focus on an analytic method, aiming to find all integer solutions, which might be finite. I think substituting symmetrically by letting a = (x - y) and s = (x + y) could help. I’ll express everything in terms of s and a, compute the left-hand side, and note that since s is a multiple of 3, it can simplify the equation significantly. Now, I need to check integer values for n and a that satisfy the equation involving D.**Analyzing integer solutions**\n\nI need to find integer n such that a cubic expression is a perfect square, while also considering the parity condition. This seems to lead me into a Diophantine equation that might be finite. I wrote it as a² = 4n³ - 15n² + 12n + 4. Maybe I should look for a change of variable to align it with a Mordell curve. I also think about bounding n for large values, noting the growth rates of the cubic versus the square, which could help in narrowing down solutions.**Using elliptic curve transformation**\n\nI’m thinking about treating the problem as an elliptic curve by letting m = n + 1. This means I can substitute n = m - 1 into the equation a² = 4n³ - 15n² + 12n + 4. I’ll compute this quickly and plug in the values. After substituting and simplifying, I find that I can factor the resulting polynomial and discover that m = 3 is a root. This leads to a factorization that makes it clearer how m relates to n, aligning everything nicely.**Simplifying factorization and finding y**\n\nThe equation has transformed nicely into a manageable form: a² = (m - 3)(4m² - 15m + 9). I can factor the quadratic part since it has an integer solution for m. Now, I've found that a² = (m - 3)²(4m - 3), leading me to express a in terms of m. For a to be an integer, I need 4m - 3 to be a perfect square. My next step involves tying this back to solutions for x and y, ensuring they remain integers through parity constraints as I explore different integer values for k.**Finding minimal y values**\n\nI just computed y_plus and y_minus, resulting in elegant forms: y_plus = k³ + 3k² - 1 and y_minus = -k³ + 3k + 1. Now, I need to search for integer values of k to find the minimal y greater than -20. I've tabulated results for k values from -5 to 5 and discovered potential y values: -51, -17, -1, 1, 3, 19, and 53. I’m confirming that y = -17 is the lowest integer greater than -20, ensuring values like -19 and -18 are absent in my findings.**Determining valid n values**\n\nI found that for n≥0, g(0)=0 is not allowed due to strict inequality, and for n=1, g(1) is positive. I determined that the quadratic equation 3n² + 9n + 8 has no real roots, so it's always positive, which means g(n) is positive only for n>0. The constraints lead to the conclusion that the unique integer satisfying the conditions is n=1, giving us x as the cube root of 4/3. I’ll format the reasoning clearly in JSON while ensuring it's valid.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Start from x^2 + xy + y^2 = ((x + y)/3 + 1)^3 and set s = x + y. The right-hand side depends only on s, so write it as ((s + 3)/3)^3. For this to be an integer, (s + 3)/3 must be an integer, which forces s to be a multiple of 3. Set s = 3n, and let a = x − y. Then x = (s + a)/2, y = (s − a)/2, and a straightforward computation gives x^2 + xy + y^2 = (3s^2 + a^2)/4. Substituting s = 3n gives (27n^2 + a^2)/4 = (n + 1)^3, so a^2 = 4n^3 − 15n^2 + 12n + 4. Shifting n by 1 (let m = n + 1) simplifies this to a^2 = (m − 3)^2(4m − 3). Thus 4m − 3 must be a perfect square; write 4m − 3 = r^2 with r odd. Let r = 2k + 1; then m = k^2 + k + 1, so n = m − 1 = k^2 + k, and we can express s and a in terms of k. Converting back to x and y and simplifying yields that all integer y arising from solutions are of the form y = k^3 + 3k^2 − 1 or y = −k^3 + 3k + 1 for integer k. We need the smallest positive value of y + 20, i.e. the smallest y ≥ −19 among these values. Evaluating these expressions for integer k (and checking algebraically that y = −19 and y = −18 are impossible) shows the smallest y with y > −20 is y = −17, which occurs, for example, at (x, y) = (53, −17). Therefore the smallest positive value of y + 20 is −17 + 20 = 3.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let n = [x] be the integer part of x, so n ≤ x < n + 1. The equation 3x^3 − [x] = 3 becomes 3x^3 − n = 3, i.e. x^3 = (n + 3)/3, so x = ((n + 3)/3)^{1/3}. This x must satisfy n ≤ ((n + 3)/3)^{1/3} < n + 1. Using the monotonicity of the cube function, the left inequality is equivalent to 3n^3 ≤ n + 3, i.e. 3n^3 − n − 3 ≤ 0, and the right inequality is equivalent to 3(n + 1)^3 − (n + 3) > 0, i.e. n(3n^2 + 9n + 8) > 0. The cubic 3n^3 − n − 3 is ≤ 0 only for integers n ≤ 1, and the product n(3n^2 + 9n + 8) is > 0 only for n > 0, since the quadratic factor is always positive. Thus the only integer n satisfying both is n = 1. For n = 1 we obtain x = ((1 + 3)/3)^{1/3} = (4/3)^{1/3}, and it indeed satisfies 1 ≤ x < 2, so [x] = 1 and 3x^3 − [x] = 3. Hence the unique real solution is x = (4/3)^{1/3}.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"(4/3)^(1/3)\"\n}",
