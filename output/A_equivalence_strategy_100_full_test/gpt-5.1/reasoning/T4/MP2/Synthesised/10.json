  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Evaluating polynomial properties**\n\nI'm looking at the degree-5 polynomial P that is related to the complex z satisfying the equation \\( z^5 + 2004z = 1 \\). For each root \\( z_i \\) of that polynomial, the values \\( w_i = z_i^2 \\) are roots of P. Since P is a degree-5 polynomial, its roots are \\( z_i^2 \\), counted with multiplicity. I need to evaluate \\( P(1) \\) and \\( P(-1) \\) to compute the ratio, which may be expressible in terms of the coefficients of the minimal polynomial.**Analyzing polynomial products**\n\nI want to express \\( \\prod(1 - z_i^2) \\) as \\( \\prod(1 - z_i)\\prod(1 + z_i) \\), observing that \\( 1 - z_i^2 = (1 - z_i)(1 + z_i) \\. Each product corresponds to \\( \\pm f(1) \\), where \\( f(t) = t^5 + 2004t - 1 \\). \n\nSo, I calculate \\( \\prod(1 - z_i) = f(1) \\) and find that equals 2004. Now for \\( \\prod(-1 - z_i) \\), that's \\( f(-1) \\), which equals -2006. I also need to understand \\( \\prod(1 + z_i) \\) in terms of these products.**Computing polynomial products**\n\nI'm computing \\( \\prod(-1 - z_i) \\) and find that it equals \\(-\\prod(1 + z_i)\\). Since there are five factors, I realize \\( \\prod(-1 - z_i) = -\\prod(1 + z_i)\\), simplifying this to \\(2006\\). \n\nNext, I need to relate \\( P(1) \\), which is \\( P(1) = \\prod(1 - z_i^2) \\) and can be expressed as \\( f(1) \\cdot (-f(-1)) = 2004 \\cdot 2006\\). For \\( P(-1) \\), I will express it in terms of \\( \\prod(1 + z_i^2) \\) instead.**Determining polynomial ratios**\n\nI realize that \\( P(x) \\) is defined as \\( \\prod(x - z_i^2) \\), so for \\( P(-1) \\), it becomes \\( \\prod(-1 - z_i^2) \\). Now I need to find the ratio \\( R = \\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} \\) or \\( \\frac{\\prod(1 - z_i^2)}{\\prod(-1 - z_i^2)} \\). \n\nTo evaluate this, I could use the minimal polynomial \\( g(w) \\) of \\( w_i = z_i^2 \\). I think \\( \\frac{g(1)}{g(-1)} \\) would be helpful since \\( P \\) is related to \\( g \\). However, calculating \\( g \\) could be complex, so perhaps expressing \\( \\prod(1 + z_i^2) \\) in terms of symmetric polynomials could simplify things!</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"First, solve 4b^2 - 3a^2 = 1 with a > 1, b ∈ ℕ. Setting x = 2b and y = a gives the Pell equation x^2 - 3y^2 = 1. Its solutions come from (2 + √3)^k. The smallest solution with y > 1 and x even occurs at k = 3, giving x = 26, y = 15, hence a = 15. Therefore d = a - 14 = 1.\\n\\nNext, let f(z) = z^5 + 2004z - 1. The condition “if z^5 + 2004z = 1 then P(z^2) = 0” means that if z_1,…,z_5 are the roots of f, then P(x) (degree 5) has roots x = z_i^2, so up to a constant factor P(x) = ∏(x - z_i^2). Thus P(d)/P(-d) = P(1)/P(-1) is independent of the scaling of P.\\n\\nCompute P(1):\\nP(1) = ∏(1 - z_i^2) = ∏(1 - z_i) ∏(1 + z_i).\\nSince f(c) = ∏(c - z_i), we have ∏(1 - z_i) = f(1) and ∏(-1 - z_i) = f(-1). Also ∏(-1 - z_i) = (-1)^5 ∏(1 + z_i) = -∏(1 + z_i), so ∏(1 + z_i) = -f(-1).\\nNow f(1) = 1 + 2004 - 1 = 2004, and f(-1) = -1 - 2004 - 1 = -2006, so ∏(1 + z_i) = 2006. Hence P(1) = 2004 · 2006 = 4,020,024.\\n\\nCompute P(-1):\\nP(-1) = ∏(-1 - z_i^2) = (-1)^5 ∏(1 + z_i^2) = -∏(1 + z_i^2).\\nWe can evaluate ∏(1 + z_i^2) as a resultant: it equals f(i)f(-i). Now f(i) = i^5 + 2004i - 1 = (1 + 2004)i - 1 = 2005i - 1, and f(-i) = (-i)^5 + 2004(-i) - 1 = -2005i - 1. Thus f(i)f(-i) = (-1)^2 + 2005^2 = 1 + 4,020,025 = 4,020,026. Therefore P(-1) = -4,020,026.\\n\\nSo P(1)/P(-1) = 4,020,024 / (-4,020,026) = -4,020,024 / 4,020,026. Dividing numerator and denominator by 2 gives -2,010,012 / 2,010,013.\\n\\nWith d = 1, the requested quotient P(d)/P(-d) equals -2010012/2010013.\",\n  \"answer\": \"-2010012/2010013\"\n}",
