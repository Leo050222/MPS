  "math_problem": "If \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers with \\( x>y \\) and \\( x+x y=391 \\), what is the value of \\( x+y \\)? Instead of finding the sum of the two positive integers satisfying the given equation and inequality, simply find \\( k = y + 14 \\), where \\( y \\) is the smaller positive integer in the pair that solves the equation under the stated conditions. There are \\( k \\) people in a room, 60% of whom are men. If no men enter or leave the room, how many women must enter the room so that 40% of the total number of people in the room are men?",

The positive factor pairs of 391 are (1, 391) and (17, 23). Testing gives the valid solution x = 23, y = 16 with x > y. Then k = y + 14 = 16 + 14 = 30. With 30 people and 60% men, there are 18 men and 12 women. Let w be the number of women who enter: the new total is 30 + w, with 18 men unchanged. We want men to be 40% of the total: 18 / (30 + w) = 0.4, which solves to w = 15.\",\n  \"answer\": \"15\"\n}",
