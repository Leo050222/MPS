  "math_problem": "Solve for $2d$ if $10d + 8 = 528$. Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance $s$ equal to that solution plus 48. Megan and Hana raced their remote control cars for $s$ m. The two cars started at the same time. The average speed of Megan's car was $\\frac{5}{4} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Hana's car finished 5 seconds before Megan's car. What was the average speed of Hana's car?",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Solving the equation**\n\nI'm working on solving the equation: \"Solve for 2d if 10d + 8 = 528.\" It seems more straightforward to find the race distance s, which is the solution to the equation plus 48. I think \"that solution\" refers to d, not 2d, since they mention not needing to determine twice the solution. So, s = d + 48, giving me 100 meters. Megan's speed is 5/4 m/s, so her time for that distance would be 80 seconds.**Calculating Hana’s speed**\n\nI’m figuring out that Hana finishes 5 seconds before Megan, which means her time t_H is 75 seconds. Since they run the same distance, I calculate her speed using the formula v_H = s / t_H. That gives me v_H = 100 / 75, simplifying to 4/3 m/s. Now I need to format this reasoning into a concise JSON summary, avoiding any LaTeX. I’ll make sure to be straightforward but clear in my explanation!</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First solve 10d + 8 = 528 to get d = 52. The race distance is s = d + 48 = 100. Megan’s speed is 5/4 m/s, so her time is t_M = 100 ÷ (5/4) = 80 s. Hana finishes 5 s earlier, so t_H = 75 s. Her speed is v_H = 100 ÷ 75 = 4/3 m/s.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4/3\"\n}",
