  "math_problem": "Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. Friday, at which point it had been on for exactly 100 hours. At what time had Kamile turned her computer on? Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day. Three different numbers from the list $2, 3, 4, 6$ have a sum of $k$. What is the product of these numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Generating JSON response**\n\nI’m calculating the product of 2, 3, and 6, which equals 36. I need to create a JSON object with a succinct \"reasoning\" that explains this without going step-by-step. It should just highlight the multiplication clearly and simply. I’ll format it like this:  \n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The product of 2, 3, and 6 is found by multiplying these numbers together.\",\n  \"answer\": \"36\"\n}  \n\nOkay, I think that works!</think>\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"The computer was on for 100 hours. Dividing by 24 hours/day gives a remainder h = 4, so k = h + 7 = 11. The three distinct numbers from {2, 3, 4, 6} that sum to 11 are 2, 3, and 6. Their product is 2 × 3 × 6 = 36.\",\n    \"answer\": \"36\"\n}",
