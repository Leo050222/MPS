  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Rethinking shaded regions**\n\nI’m considering the problem about the shaded regions. If the shaded ones are equal, there are four, which leads to θ = 200 degrees (4 times 50). That makes N = 2900 (adding 2700). But wait, if I consider two special angles shaded, I get θ = 160 degrees, leading N = 2860. Since 2700 is a multiple of 360, they might want the answer mod 360, but it seems like a clue is needed. Both answers look nice, but it’s tricky!**Exploring designs and GCDs**\n\nI'm mulling over designs that often shade majority segments, but I'm unclear since the original visual should specify that. I’ll assume that four regions are shaded, leading to θ = 200 and an answer of 2900. Now for the second problem: I want to figure out how many values of k (up to 2940) make the gcd of (205800, 35k) a perfect square. Starting with prime factorization: 205800 breaks down nicely into 2^3 * 3 * 5^2 * 7^3. I know 35 is 5 * 7, and I need to further unravel this!**Analyzing GCD factors**\n\nI'm breaking down k's prime factorization, which involves primes 2, 3, 5, 7, and potentially others. Since the gcd with 205800 and 35k will only include common primes, I determine that they must come from the primes dividing 205800. So, the gcd will include factors from the set {2, 3, 5, 7}. \n\nI’ll express 205800 as 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^2 * 7^3 and represent k as 2^a * 3^b * 5^c * 7^d * r (where r is coprime). For the exponents of the GCD to be even, which ensures it's a perfect square, I need to impose conditions on a, b, c, and d for all k values up to 2940.**Determining exponent ranges**\n\nI'm figuring out the allowed ranges for the primes. Starting with prime 2, the exponent for 205800 is 3. For e2, which is min(3, a), it needs to be even, meaning it can only be 0 or 2. So, I find that a can only be 0 or 2.\n\nNow, prime 3 has an exponent of 1, and e3 must be 0 (the only even value possible), meaning b has to be 0.\n\nFor prime 5, e5 must also be even but cannot be 0 because it includes at least one factor of 5 from 35k. That leads to the conclusion that e5 can either be 1 or 2.**Finding valid k counts**\n\nAlright, I need to ensure the exponents are even. For prime 5, e5 must equal 2, which sets c ≥ 1. For prime 7, since e7 must also be 2, that fixes d at 1.\n\nNow, defining k gives me a structure of k = 2^a * 3^0 * 5^c * 7^1 * r, where a can be 0 or 2, c is at least 1, and r is coprime to 2, 3, 5, and 7. I also have to ensure that the overall k is ≤ 2940.\n\nThen, I look at how many combinations of (a, c) are possible, and I’ll compute how many r fit that structure while checking which values hold up against gcd limits. Ultimately, I’ll calculate counts for T based on values of a and c while applying the inclusion-exclusion principle for determining coprime integers.**Calculating valid integers**\n\nI need to find the count of integers less than or equal to 84 that aren't divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. Using inclusion-exclusion, I determine how many multiples exist for each factor and combinations of them. After tallying these counts, I find 20 integers are coprime to 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nThen for the combinations of a and c, I compute the results for k. The total count I arrive at is 30 possible k values, and I confirm a few values to ensure the gcd remains a perfect square. I feel confident about my calculations here!</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The spinner is a full circle, so the six central angles sum to 360 degrees: 4x + 20 + 140 = 360, giving x = 50. Assuming the four equal regions are the shaded ones, their total angle is θ = 4x = 200. Then N = θ + 2700 = 200 + 2700 = 2900.\\n\\nProblem 2: Factor 205800 = 2^3 * 3 * 5^2 * 7^3 and 35 = 5 * 7. Write k = 2^a * 3^b * 5^c * 7^d * r with r coprime to 2,3,5,7. Then gcd(205800, 35k) has exponents e_2 = min(3,a), e_3 = min(1,b), e_5 = min(2,c+1), e_7 = min(3,d+1). For the gcd to be a perfect square, each e_i must be even, which forces a ∈ {0,2}, b = 0, c ≥ 1, d = 1, and r coprime to 2,3,5,7. So k has the form k = 2^a * 5^c * 7 * r with a ∈ {0,2}, c ≥ 1, gcd(r,210) = 1, and k ≤ 2940. For each (a,c) combination, define M = 7 * 5^c * 2^a and T = floor(2940/M); then r runs over integers 1 ≤ r ≤ T coprime to 210. For (a,c) = (0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(2,1),(2,2), we get T = 84,16,3,21,4 respectively. Counting numbers ≤T not divisible by 2,3,5,7 (using inclusion-exclusion or direct listing) yields 20, 3, 1, 5, and 1 respectively. Summing these gives 20 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 30 possible values of k.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2900\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"30\"\n}",
