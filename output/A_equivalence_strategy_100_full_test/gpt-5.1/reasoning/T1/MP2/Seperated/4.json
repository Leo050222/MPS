Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Convert 300 GB to megabytes using 1 GB = 1024 MB, so C = 300 × 1024 = 307200 MB. Then compute d = C − 307100 = 307200 − 307100 = 100. Problem 2: Bicycle: 20% of 320 is 64, so sale price is 320 − 64 = 256. Helmet: 10% of 80 is 8, so sale price is 80 − 8 = 72. Regular total is 320 + 80 = 400; sale total is 256 + 72 = 328. Total savings is 400 − 328 = 72. Percentage savings is 72 ÷ 400 = 0.18 = 18%.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"18%\"\n}",
