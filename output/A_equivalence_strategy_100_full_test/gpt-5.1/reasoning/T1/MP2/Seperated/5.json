      "A3077": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$."

  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Calculating candy counts**\n\nI want to eat the smallest possible number of candies, so I need to maximize \\( n \\) while keeping it between 0 and 3 (since there are only 3 blue candies). The maximum \\( n \\) is 3, leading to 11 candies eaten in total. To ensure feasibility, she must eat 7 red, 4 yellow, and 0 blue to leave 3 of each. This means the minimum eaten is indeed 11.\n\nFor the reasoning, I’d summarize that for each problem, I set up ratios, solved for values, and took care to avoid invalid JSON formatting by omitting trailing commas.</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Represent the numbers of skateboards and bicycles as 7k and 4k. Their difference equals the given difference, which determines k; then compute d as k plus 6. Problem 2: After eating candies, the remaining equal count for each color cannot exceed the smallest initial count. To minimize candies eaten, maximize this common remaining count, ensuring it does not exceed any initial amount, then subtract the remaining total from the initial total.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
