For the second problem, I need to find three distinct numbers from the set {2, 3, 4, 6} that sum to 11. I try combinations: 2 + 3 + 4 equals 9; 2 + 3 + 6 equals 11, so that works; 2 + 4 + 6 is too high, and 3 + 4 + 6 exceeds the target. So the numbers are 2, 3, and 6, giving a product of 36. I'll put this in JSON format!</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The total duration is 100 hours; 100 divided by 24 leaves a remainder of 4, so k = 4 + 7 = 11.
