For \\(x=17\\), \\(y=22\\), it’s also false. However, with \\(x=23\\), I find \\(y=16\\) fits since \\(23>16\\) is true. So, my solution is \\((23,16)\\). I'm instructed to calculate \\(k\\) instead, where \\(y+14\\) gives \\(k=30\\). \n\nFor a separate problem, with 30 people and 60% men, I find \\(w=15\\) to meet the condition of men being 40% of the total.**Crafting concise reasoning**\n\nI need to provide both answers as strings in a JSON format. The reasoning should be brief, summarizing the solution without getting too granular in the algebra steps. Instead of listing everything step by step, I’ll create a short paragraph that covers the essence of how I reached the answers. It looks like I can use 3-4 sentences to effectively convey the logic. I’ll make sure to format it correctly in JSON and keep it straightforward.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, rewrite the equation as x(1 + y) = 391 and factor 391 into positive integer pairs. Checking these pairs under the condition x > y yields the unique solution (x, y) = (23, 16), so k = y + 14 = 30. For Problem 2, start with 30 people and 60% men, giving 18 men and 12 women. Let w be the number of women entering so the new total is 30 + w; requiring men to be 40% of the total gives 18 = 0.4(30 + w), which solves to w = 15.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"30\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"15\"\n}",
