  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Figuring out reasoning steps**\n\nThe user is asking for a step-by-step reasoning process followed by a JSON output. While I must comply with guidelines not to share the full chain-of-thought, I can still provide a brief explanation of my reasoning. For the math problem, I’m identifying a 4-digit perfect square where each digit is less than 6, and adding 1 to each digit also results in a perfect square. My approach will involve checking 4-digit squares from 32^2 to 99^2, ensuring each digit meets the constraints.**Understanding the problem constraints**\n\nI'm working on a mathematical problem involving perfect squares. I define n as a perfect square, a², and n' as the number formed by adding 1 to each digit of n. \n\nThe digits must remain within 0-5 for n, which means n is between 1000 and 5999, leading a to be between 32 and 77. Therefore, n' will be between approximately 2111 and 6666. I estimate b, where b² is the perfect square, must be between 46 and 81. I think using mod 9 or 11 might help with the calculations.**Solving the perfect square difference**\n\nI’m figuring out how adding 1 to each digit of a number impacts its value. This operation isn't linear, but I realized the difference between n' and n is always 1111. Therefore, n' equals n + 1111. This means that I want two perfect squares a² and b² that differ by 1111. \n\nUsing the factorization method, I find that 1111 breaks down into (1, 1111) and (11, 101). When I solve the pair (11, 101), I determine that a = 45 and b = 56, which fits within my constraints!**Verifying squares and finding remainders**\n\nI've confirmed that 45² equals 2025, which has digits less than or equal to 5. When I add 1111, I get n' as 3136, which equals 56² and also fits the digit criteria. This means a = 45, and for m = a - 42, the answer is 3.\n\nNext, I'm working on the polynomial P with given remainders using the Remainder Theorem. I need a quadratic R(x) that fits the points (1, -4), (2, -1), and (3, 4). I've solved for R(x) as x² - 5, which seems correct!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI’m organizing my output into a valid JSON format. I need to provide a concise reasoning field and ensure there’s no trailing comma after the last property. \n\nIncluding \"answer_1\" as a numeric string in quotes is necessary, which gives me:  \n{\n \"reasoning\": \"Adding 1 to each digit increases the number by 1111 while maintaining the digit constraints.\",\n \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n \"answer_2\": \"x^2-5\"\n}.  \n\nI'll keep my reasoning as a single sentence. I’ll avoid double quotes unless needed to keep things simple!</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, let the original 4-digit square be n = a^2 and the new square after adding 1 to each digit be n' = b^2. Because all digits in n are at most 5, adding 1 to each digit produces n' = n + 1111 with no carries, so b^2 - a^2 = 1111. Factor 1111 = 11 * 101. Then (b - a)(b + a) = 1111 gives the positive factor pairs (1,1111) and (11,101). The first gives a far too large a; the second yields b - a = 11 and b + a = 101, so a = 45 and b = 56. Then n = 45^2 = 2025, n + 1111 = 3136 = 56^2, consistent with the digit condition. We need m = a - 42, so m = 3. For Problem 2, the divisor x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 factors as (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3). Let R(x) be the remainder when P is divided by this cubic; then deg R < 3, so R(x) is quadratic. Since P(1) = -4, P(2) = -1, and P(3) = 4, the same must hold for R at x = 1,2,3. Find the unique quadratic R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c interpolating the points (1,-4), (2,-1), and (3,4); from the constant second difference we get a = 1, then solving the linear system from the first two points yields b = 0 and c = -5, so R(x) = x^2 - 5.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"x^2-5\"\n}",
