  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Calculating polynomial coefficients**\n\nI need to use Newton's sums for the roots of a cubic polynomial. Let’s define p1 as the sum of the roots a, b, and c, and p2 as the sum of their squares. The polynomial I'm working with is x^3 + x^2 - 333x - 1001. From this, I see that the coefficients are c2 = 1, c1 = -333, and c0 = -1001. \n\nFollowing Newton's formulas, I calculate that p1 = -c2, which means p1 = -1. For p2, I derive p2 = 667 after ensuring the calculations align correctly.**Calculating p3**\n\nTo find p3, I’ll use the formula p3 = -(c2 * p2 + c1 * p1 + 3 * c0). Plugging in the values: c2 is 1, p2 is 667, c1 is -333, and c0 is -1001. I compute each part: 1 * 667 = 667, -333 * -1 = 333, and 3 * -1001 = -3003. Adding these gives me 1000, then combining with -3003 to yield -2003. After negating that, p3 equals 2003. \n\nI’ll format the results into JSON without extra text or a trailing comma to ensure validity.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: From a + b = 3 and (a − b)^2 = 49, we get a − b = ±7. This yields integer pairs (a, b) = (5, −2) or (−2, 5). The expression s(a, b) = a^3 + b^3 − 60ab(a + b) is symmetric in a and b, so both pairs give the same value. Evaluating s for (5, −2) gives 1917, so e = s − 1914 = 3.\\nProblem 2: For p(x) = x^3 + x^2 − 333x − 1001 with roots a, b, c, use Newton's sums. Let p1 = a + b + c, p2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2, p3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3. From the coefficients, p1 = −1, then p2 and p3 are found via the Newton identities for a monic cubic x^3 + c2 x^2 + c1 x + c0: p1 + c2 = 0, p2 + c2 p1 + 2c1 = 0, p3 + c2 p2 + c1 p1 + 3c0 = 0. Substituting c2 = 1, c1 = −333, c0 = −1001 gives p3 = 2003, so a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 2003.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"2003\"\n}",
