  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing the problem**\n\nI’m trying to understand what the user means by their question. They specified \"where r is the prime number such that r + 1 equals the numerator,\" and the numerator is given as 4. So, r + 1 = 4 means r = 3, and then n = r + 2009 = 2012 could be the answer. However, maybe I should question if \"denominator\" was meant instead. Still, I’ll conclude that the answer is 2012 based on their wording.**Exploring random walks**\n\nI’m checking if any r can satisfy r + 1 = 4, and it looks like only r = 3 works. Now, shifting to a different problem about a random walk on a toroidal 8x8 grid. I’m curious about the probability of returning to the origin after 2012 steps. \n\nI can model this using coordinates modulo 8 and diagonal movements. The increments apply both x and y, leading to interesting correlations. I need to analyze the independence of these increments and their correlation too. Let's dive into the expected values!**Analyzing the Markov process**\n\nI’m considering a situation with 2 states having a product of 1 and 2 states with -1, leading to an expected value of 0. The increments aren't independent, but they are symmetric. I can approach this as a Markov chain on Z_8×Z_8 to find the probability of returning to the origin after 2012 steps by utilizing the transition matrix.\n\nFrom here, I will explore eigenvalues and characters of the group. It looks like I’ll need to compute the characteristic function and simplify the eigenvalue expression accordingly. Let’s keep going with these calculations!**Calculating eigenvalues and probabilities**\n\nI’m working with eigenvalues here, simplifying the expression as (1/2) times the sum of cosine terms, which factors nicely: λ = cos(π a/4) * cos(π b/4). This means the return probability P_n(0,0) can be expressed using those eigenvalues.\n\nNow I’ll compute S_n, which involves the cosine values for k = 0 to 7. The contributions stem from simplifications based on the periodic properties of cosine. This leads me to find S_{2012} and ultimately the probability. Let's calculate those cosine values now!**Formulating the random walk model**\n\nI'm modeling a random walk on a toroidal 8x8 grid as a process on Z_8×Z_8 with diagonal steps. Using Fourier characters, I found that the return probability after n steps can be expressed in a formula. For n=2012, the probability simplifies to \\[(2^{1005}+1)^2/2^{2014}\\].\n\nNow, I need to express this in a way that adheres to JSON formatting; I'll replace π with \"pi\" and Σ with \"sum\" to stick to ASCII. Keeping it clear and high-level is essential. Let's frame the final reasoning line accordingly!</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The subtracted fraction is 4/(r+1), whose numerator is 4, so r+1 = 4, giving r = 3 (a prime), hence n = r + 2009 = 2012. Problem 2: View the walk on the 8x8 toroidal board as a random walk on Z_8 x Z_8 with steps (±1, ±1) chosen uniformly; diagonalizing this walk via characters shows that the eigenvalues are cos(pi a/4) cos(pi b/4), so the return probability after n steps is (S_n^2)/64 where S_n = sum_{k=0}^7 cos(pi k/4)^n; evaluating S_n for even n and plugging in n = 2012 yields the exact probability (2^{1005} + 1)^2 / 2^{2014}.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2012\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"(2^{1005}+1)^2/2^{2014}\"\n}",
