  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Revisiting multiplicative relations**\n\nI'm thinking about the multiplicative relation: ε_{m+n} = ε_m ε_n. So, since 0 < ε < 1, ε_n approaches 0 as n goes to infinity. But α^n grows, and we can decompose α^n = 2017 a_n + ε^n. The distance from α^n to the nearest multiple of 2017 approaches 0, meaning fractional parts {α^n/2017} converge to 0. I'm remembering a theorem about fractional parts of α^n being dense, particularly interesting with Pisot and Salem numbers. I’m connecting these ideas here.**Exploring Pisot-like properties**\n\nI’m exploring a similar structure to Pisot numbers. Let β be equal to α, which has the property that the distance from α^n to the nearest multiple of 2017 tends to 0. This seems equivalent to looking at the fractional part of (α/2017)^n. While there are Pisot numbers where α^n is close to integers, we can scale these considerations. Our multiples of 2017 aren't exponentially increasing, just spaced apart, leading to smaller relative errors. I think the condition is that ε^n must also approach 0, hinting at Pisot-like properties relative to the integer lattice.**Analyzing Pisot numbers**\n\nLet’s suppose β is a Pisot number greater than 1, where the property states that there exist integers \\( m_n \\) such that the distance |β^n - m_n| approaches 0. Now, for α, if α^n - 2017 a_n is also close to 0, it makes me think about how ε might fit in here. I realize using the earlier multiplicative property is a more straightforward path, suggesting that α or ε could be rational. I should explore further!**Exploring dependency relations**\n\nI'm considering that c and α being linearly dependent over the rationals means they form a one-dimensional Q-vector space, like Q + Qα. I think I can express \\( a_n \\) explicitly in terms of c: \\( a_n = \\frac{(2017 a_1 + c)^n - c^n}{2017} \\), and expanding this using the binomial theorem should give me integer coefficients. I also wonder if I can define a sequence \\( b_n = a_{n+1} - a_1 a_n \\) to lead to integer sequences. I feel I'm leaning toward concluding that such an α likely doesn't exist.**Investigating potential α values**\n\nI'm considering whether we can find an explicit example of α. If I let α = 2017 + ε, where 0 < ε < 1 is small and irrational, then α^n gets close to 2017^n, which may not approach multiples of 2017. If I instead take α close to 1, like α = 1 + δ, that also leads to contradictions with the multiples of 2017. I keep circling back to the relationship defined by ε_{m+n} = ε_m ε_n; I wonder if I can construct α through specific algebraic relationships or constraints, but that feels complicated.**Exploring α relationships**\n\nI'm considering the relationships between α, ε, and integer sequences. When I look at the expression involving α^m and α^n, I notice it must equal a form that keeps A as an integer. This leads me to a recurrence relation for a_n. However, I suspect irrational parts might cancel, and I ponder if ε is algebraic or not. I think ε needs to be algebraic of degree 2; otherwise, it could lead to contradictions. I’m mulling over how coefficients tie back to rationality and linear combinations of powers of ε.**Establishing no irrational α**\n\nI'm exploring whether any α exists that meets certain conditions, and I'm leaning toward concluding that the answer is \"No\". I've established that if ε is irrational, then certain terms must cancel to produce integers. Specifically, I find that the relation a_{2n} allows me to conclude that ε^n must be rational for positive integers, which contradicts ε being irrational. Ultimately, if ε^n is rational for infinitely many n, that forces ε to be rational, which contradicts my initial assumption. Therefore, I conclude no such irrational α exists.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Q(x)=x^2+2x+3 has derivative Q'(x)=2x+2, whose unique real root is r=-1. Then Q(-1)=(-1)^2+2(-1)+3=1-2+3=2, so k=Q(r)-1=2-1=1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Assume there exists irrational α>1 such that floor(α^n) is divisible by 2017 for all n≥1. Write α^n=2017 a_n+ε_n with integers a_n and 0≤ε_n<1. Using multiplicativity modulo 2017, one finds ε_{m+n}=ε_m ε_n, so ε_n=ε^n for some ε=ε_1 with 0<ε<1. Then α^n=2017 a_n+ε^n. From n→2n, comparing expressions yields a_{2n}=2017 a_n^2+2 a_n ε^n, so 2 a_n ε^n is an integer. Since a_n>0 for all n (because α^n>1>ε^n), ε^n is rational for every n. Having ε^m and ε^n rational for some coprime m,n implies ε itself is rational, hence α=2017 a_1+ε is rational, contradicting the assumption that α is irrational. Therefore no such irrational α exists.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
