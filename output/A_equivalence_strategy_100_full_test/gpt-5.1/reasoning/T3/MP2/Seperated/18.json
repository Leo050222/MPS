      "A401": "Trevor and Edward play a game in which they take turns adding or removing beans from a pile. On each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. The player who empties the pile wins. For example, if Trevor goes first with a pile of 5 beans, he can either add 4 to make the total 9, or remove 4 to make the total 1, and either way Edward wins by removing all the beans. There is no limit to how large the pile can grow; it just starts with some finite number of beans in it, say fewer than 1000. Before the game begins, Edward dispatches a spy to find out how many beans will be in the opening pile, call this $n$, then \"graciously\" offers to let Trevor go first. Knowing that the first player is more likely to win, but not knowing $n$, Trevor logically but unwisely accepts, and Edward goes on to win the game. Find a number $n$ less than 1000 that would prompt this scenario, assuming both players are perfect logicians. A correct answer is worth the nearest integer to $\\log _{2}(n-4)$ points. Instead of finding an initial pile size $n$ less than 1000 that is a losing position for the first player under perfect play, simply find $k = s(p) - 6$, where $p$ is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example, and $s(p)$ is the largest perfect square at most $p$."

  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Clarifying math problems**\n\nI'm exploring two problems. For the first, it involves starting with 5, adding 4 to get 9, and identifying that the largest perfect square less than or equal to 9 is 9 itself. So, k equals 3. Now, for the second problem, I’m coloring the vertices of a tetrahedron using three colors without allowing any face to be monochromatic. This means no face can have all three vertices in the same color. I'll double-check my understanding of this constraint.**Understanding tetrahedron coloring**\n\nI'm looking closer at the tetrahedron coloring problem. The condition specifies that no face can have all three vertices in the same color, meaning cases like (R,R,R) are banned while (R,B,B) is allowed. It seems that each face just needs to avoid being monochromatic. Each of the four triangular faces must be non-monochromatic, so I need to count the possible colorings for the four vertices labeled 1-4 using three colors: red, blue, and green. I'll remember that each face only includes three out of the four vertices.**Clarifying color conditions**\n\nI'm exploring what it means for a tetrahedron to have no monochromatic faces. It seems that to have a monochromatic face, three vertices must share the same color. If three out of four vertices are the same color, that face is monochromatic. The same applies if all four are identical. So, the condition really boils down to avoiding any set of three vertices sharing a color. Essentially, I need to avoid colorings where any color appears on three or more vertices.**Defining allowed colorings**\n\nI’m realizing that if any color appears on three or more vertices, then one of the triples must form a monochromatic face. So, for allowed colorings, each color can only appear twice at most. This means I have to figure out how to partition four vertices into up to three color counts where none exceeds two. The valid combinations are either two colors appearing twice each, or one color appearing twice while the other two appear once each. This setup guarantees that no color appears three times!**Applying Burnside's lemma**\n\nI'm diving into counting the orbits of vertex colorings under the tetrahedron's rotational symmetry. The group has 12 elements, and I want to use Burnside's lemma, which involves counting colorings invariant under group actions. I realize that my property \"no color occurs three times\" is crucial but isn't group-invariant. For the identity rotation, all 54 colorings should work, but for 3-fold rotations, none work since they lead to at least one color appearing three or four times. For 2-fold rotations, there are nine fixed colorings, ensuring I maintain the no-three color requirement. Counting these aspects will be essential as I proceed!**Summarizing Burnside’s application**\n\nI'm working through counting the rotationally distinct colorings of a tetrahedron using Burnside's lemma. The key findings here are that for valid colorings, colors can only appear on pairs of vertices. I've deduced that there are 6 valid orbits based on the conditions set—each restricting color counts to prevent any from appearing three times. I also confirmed the calculations for colorings fixed by different rotation types were correct, leading to this conclusion. Now, I’m packaging everything neatly into JSON while crafting a concise reasoning summary!</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, the example starts with an initial pile of 5 beans. The rule is to add or remove the largest perfect square not exceeding the current pile size. For 5, the largest perfect square is 4. The problem asks us to consider the pile size p reached by adding this square to the initial pile, so p = 5 + 4 = 9. Then s(p) is defined as the largest perfect square at most p, which for p = 9 is s(9) = 9. Finally, k is defined as s(p) - 6, giving k = 9 - 6 = 3.\\n\\nFor Problem 2, label the tetrahedron’s four vertices and color each vertex red, blue, or green. The condition that no face has all three vertices the same color is equivalent (for a tetrahedron) to saying no color appears on three or more of the four vertices, because every triple of vertices is a face. Thus, each color can appear at most twice, so the allowed color-multiplicity patterns are (2,2,0) and (2,1,1) across the three colors. Counting all such valid colorings on labeled vertices gives 54. To count them up to rotational symmetry, use Burnside’s lemma with the tetrahedron’s rotation group of size 12 (identity, eight 3-fold rotations, and three 2-fold rotations). Under the identity, all 54 valid colorings are fixed. A 3-fold rotation fixes only colorings where three vertices share a color, which violates the constraint, so it fixes 0 valid colorings. A 2-fold rotation swaps two disjoint pairs of vertices; a coloring fixed by such a rotation is determined by the colors on the two pairs. There are 3 × 3 = 9 such colorings in total, but only those where the two pairs have different colors satisfy the constraint (giving 6 valid colorings fixed by each 2-fold rotation). Applying Burnside’s lemma, the number of distinct colorings is (54 + 8·0 + 3·6)/12 = 72/12 = 6.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
