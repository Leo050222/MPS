  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Calculating even and odd sums**\n\nI’m thinking about using the formula for isolating even and odd parts of a polynomial. For digits less than 10, I can use one formula, but for more than 9, I’m dealing with carries. Then, I break it down into even (E) and odd (O) parts, using the sums of P(10) and P(-10). \n\nAfter some arithmetic checks, it seems that my calculations for E and O yield the correct results, and I realize I may not need all coefficients. I only need a3.**Analyzing digit contributions**\n\nI'm exploring the calculation of O as a sum involving powers of 10, where O equals 29,130. Each coefficient ai is a non-negative integer less than 100, so I can solve for a1, a3, a5, and so on from O's decimal structure. \n\nI realize that while powers of 10 occupy different positions, their contributions could overlap in the decimal system. For instance, I see how 10 for a1 affects the tens and possibly hundreds place. I need to verify how this impacts my calculations regarding a1.**Identifying digit positions**\n\nI’m analyzing the decimal representation of O, which relates to the positions of digits. The maximum impact is from terms like 10*ab, influencing the units, tens, and hundreds places. For instance, terms from a3 affect positions 3, 4, and 5, while a5 impacts positions 5, 6, and 7.\n\nSince O is only 29,130, it can't include a5 because that would require a minimum of 100,000. I conclude that a1 and a3 are the only non-zero coefficients, giving me the equation: 10*a1 + 1000*a3 = 29,130.**Calculating coefficients and k**\n\nI'm working to derive a relationship by dividing my last equation by 10, leading to a1 + 100*a3 = 2,913. Knowing a1 must be less than 100 helps limit a3 to 29. \n\nSo, a3 can only be 0 to 29, but checking the constraints reveals that a3 has to be exactly 29 for the equations to hold true, giving me a1 as 13. They ask for k=a3-27, so k equals 2. Since I’m ignoring P(1) for this step, I confirm my answer as 2.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI'm preparing to summarize my reasoning for both problems clearly without going into excessive detail. For Problem 1, I used P(10) and P(-10) to separate the even and odd parts, solving for a3 to compute k. For Problem 2, I applied the primitive Pythagorean triple parameterization, expressed relevant equations, and used divisibility rules to identify options, resulting in a maximum value of 45. \n\nNow, I need to format this into valid JSON without added text. Let's get to that. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, used P(10),P(-10) to separate even/odd parts; solved odd part to get a3; then compute k. For Problem 2, used primitive Pythagorean triple parameterization; expressed P^2/A; simplified to function of m/n; used divisibility to find finite options; got max 45.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"45\"\n}\n```</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Write P(x)=∑a_i x^i with 0≤a_i<100 integers. From P(10)=331633 and P(-10)=273373, separate even- and odd-degree parts: E=(P(10)+P(-10))/2=302503 and O=(P(10)-P(-10))/2=29130. The odd part is O=10 a_1 + 1000 a_3 (higher odd terms vanish because O<100000). Thus 10 a_1 + 1000 a_3 = 29130 ⇒ a_1 + 100 a_3 = 2913. With 0≤a_1<100, this forces a_3=29 and a_1=13. Then k=a_3−27=29−27=2. (A quick check on the even part confirms all coefficients remain <100.)\\n\\nProblem 2: For a primitive integer right triangle, parameterize sides by m>n, coprime, opposite parity: a=m^2−n^2, b=2mn, c=m^2+n^2. Then perimeter P=a+b+c=2m(m+n) and area A=ab/2=mn(m^2−n^2). Hence P^2/A = 4m(m+n)^2 / [n(m^2−n^2)] = 4m(m+n)/[n(m−n)]. Let r=m/n=p/q in lowest terms; then this ratio becomes R = 4p(p+q)/[q(p−q)] = 4p/q + 8 + 8q/(p−q). For R to be an integer, use gcd(p,q)=1 to deduce q | 4p and (p−q) | 8q, which, with gcd(q,p−q)=1, implies q ∈ {1,2,4} and p−q ∈ {1,2,4,8}. Enumerating pairs (p,q) with p>q, gcd(p,q)=1, and opposite parity gives (2,1), (3,2), (5,4) yielding R values 24, 30, and 45 respectively. The largest integer value is 45, realized by m=5,n=4, giving the triangle (9,40,41) with P=90, A=180, and P^2/A=45.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"45\"\n}",
