  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Calculating series sums**\n\nI'm plugging into the equations. I simplify: (b+1/2) + b + c = 1 leads to c = 1/2 - 2b. The second equation gives me values for b and c, ultimately finding b = 0 and c = 1/2. Then I look at the series: S = Σ from n=2 to 17 involving fractions. The first sum, S1, telescopes nicely, reducing to 1 - 1/17, resulting in 16/17. So I'm working through the math to get these values!**Summarizing series calculations**\n\nFor the second sum, S2, I rewrite it as a telescoping series: Σ from n=2 to 17 of 1/[(n+1)(n+2)]. Substituting variables gives me a clean cancellation pattern, leading to S2 = 1/3 - 1/19, which simplifies to 16/57. \n\nThen, I combine my sums, arriving at S = 592/969 after checking for common factors and ensuring accuracy through modular arithmetic. It all checks out well, so now I just need to frame the final response clearly!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI want to make sure the user is satisfied, even though they asked for a step-by-step approach; I can only provide a short overview instead. That’s fine! I’ll stick to just delivering the JSON format they need without any extra commentary. \n\nThe answers will be set as \"answer_1\": 2 and \"answer_2\": \"592/969\". I'll double-check to ensure the JSON is valid and that there are no trailing commas. Keeping it simple and precise will definitely help!</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, note that x1 and x2 both satisfy t^2 + t - A = 0, so they are the two (distinct) roots of this quadratic. The condition f(x1) = f(x2) for f(t) = t^4 + 3t^3 + 5t means that the remainder of f(t) upon division by t^2 + t - A must be constant (no t-term). Reducing f(t) modulo t^2 + t - A gives a remainder of (A+7)t + (A^2 - 2A), so we require A+7 = 0, hence A = -7, and k = A + 9 = 2. For Problem 2, first factor the denominator n^4 + 2n^3 - n^2 - 2n as n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2). Perform partial fraction decomposition to express (n^2 + n + 1)/[n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2)] as 1/2[1/((n-1)n) + 1/((n+1)(n+2))]. Both sums telescope: Σ_{n=2}^{17} 1/((n-1)n) = 16/17 and Σ_{n=2}^{17} 1/((n+1)(n+2)) = 1/3 - 1/19 = 16/57. Combining gives the total sum as (1/2)(16/17 + 16/57) = 592/969.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"592/969\"\n}",
