  "math_problem": "A point $(x, y)$ is selected uniformly at random from the unit square $S=\\{(x, y) \\mid 0 \\leq x \\leq 1,0 \\leq y \\leq 1\\}$. If the probability that $(3x+2y, x+4y)$ is in $S$ is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a+b$. Instead of computing the numerical identifier from the fractional probability that the transformed point remains within the unit square, simply find $k=$ area$(R) + 1553/120$, where area$(R)$ is the measure of the subset of the unit square on which both components of the linear transformation are at most 1. In bridge, a standard 52-card deck is dealt in the usual way to 4 players. By convention, each hand is assigned a number of \"points\" based on the formula $$4 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~A} \\text {'s })+3 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~K} \\text {'s })+2 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{Q} \\text {'s })+1 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~J} \\text {'s })$$ Given that a particular hand has exactly 4 cards that are A, K, Q, or J, find the probability that its point value is $k$ or higher.",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Calculating line intersections**\n\nI’m looking at a geometry problem involving two lines: 3x+2y=1 and x+4y=1, with x,y≥0. I’ll find their intersections with the axes first. For the first line, at the x-axis (y=0), x becomes 1/3; at the y-axis (x=0), y is 1/2. For the second line, at the x-axis it’s x=1 and at the y-axis y=1/4. \n\nI need the intersection of these lines and to sketch the polygon formed in the first quadrant. Let’s solve for that.**Analyzing inequalities**\n\nI’m looking at two inequalities: 3x+2y≤1 which leads to y ≤ (1-3x)/2, and x+4y≤1 resulting in y ≤ (1-x)/4. The area of interest lies beneath both curves where the smaller function governs.\n\nWhere they cross is at x=1/5. At x=0, y1 is 0.5 and y2 is 0.25, so y2 is lower. At around x=1/3, y1 is 0 and y2 is 1/6, indicating y1 is the lower function now. The valid region will also include y≥0, forming a polygon with defined vertices at (0,0), (0,1/4), (1/5,1/5), and (1/3,0). I’ll calculate the area of this quadrilateral next.**Calculating area and threshold**\n\nI’m calculating the area of a polygon using integration: area = ∫_0^{1/5} y_max(x) dx + ∫_{1/5}^{1/3} y_max2(x) dx, where y_max is the lesser of the two curves. From 0 to 1/5, I’ll use y2, and from 1/5 to 1/3, y1.\n\nFor y2, I find the integral from 0 to 1/5 of (1-x)/4, which results in 9/200. Then for y1, I compute from 1/5 to 1/3, leading to 1/75. Adding these gives an area of 7/120. \n\nNext, I calculate k using this area, leading to a threshold of 13 for the second part concerning bridge cards.**Calculating probability with honors**\n\nI’m analyzing a hand with exactly 4 honor cards and trying to find the probability that the high-card point count is 13 or more. The point values are based on rank: Ace = 4, King = 3, Queen = 2, and Jack = 1. \n\nI need to choose 4 honors from 16 cards without replacement, and then I’ll draw the remaining 9 cards from the 36 non-honor cards, which don't affect the point total. Given the condition of 4 honors, all possible combinations of these honor cards are equally likely, so I’ll need to calculate the total number of combinations, C(16,4).**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI'm processing the requirements for a JSON response. Their example suggests a structure like { \"reasoning\": \"...\", \"answer\": \"42\" }, but while the rules specify only to provide the answer in JSON format, they also show examples with reasoning included. Since clarity is key, I’ll stick to what’s safest: I’ll only include the \"answer\" in my JSON to avoid any potential confusion.\n\nI'll add a brief explanation beforehand, then provide the JSON block as the final part, ensuring no extra text afterward. \n\nMy final answer will be: \n{\n  \"answer\": \"197/1820\"\n}</think>\n\nTo determine the threshold \\(k\\), we first compute the area of the region\n\\[\nR = \\{(x,y)\\in[0,1]^2 : 3x+2y \\le 1,\\ x+4y \\le 1\\}.\n\\]\n\nThe boundary lines are:\n- \\(3x+2y=1\\): intersects axes at \\((1/3,0)\\) and \\((0,1/2)\\),\n- \\(x+4y=1\\): intersects axes at \\((1,0)\\) and \\((0,1/4)\\).\n\nTheir intersection is at \\((x,y)=(1/5,1/5)\\).\n\nWithin the unit square, the feasible region \\(R\\) is the quadrilateral with vertices\n\\((0,0)\\), \\((0,1/4)\\), \\((1/5,1/5)\\), and \\((1/3,0)\\). Its area can be computed by integrating the lower of the two lines over \\(x\\):\n\n- For \\(0 \\le x \\le 1/5\\), the upper boundary is \\(y = (1-x)/4\\),\n- For \\(1/5 \\le x \\le 1/3\\), the upper boundary is \\(y = (1-3x)/2\\).\n\nSo\n\\[\n\\text{area}(R)\n= \\int_0^{1/5} \\frac{1-x}{4}\\,dx\n+ \\int_{1/5}^{1/3} \\frac{1-3x}{2}\\,dx\n= \\frac{9}{200} + \\frac{1}{75}\n= \\frac{7}{120}.\n\\]\n\nHence\n\\[\nk = \\text{area}(R) + \\frac{1553}{120}\n= \\frac{7}{120} + \\frac{1553}{120}\n= \\frac{1560}{120}\n= 13.\n\\]\n\nNow consider a 13-card bridge hand from a standard 52-card deck, with exactly 4 honor cards (A, K, Q, J). There are 16 honor cards in the deck (4 of each rank). Conditioning on “exactly 4 honors” means the 4 honor cards in the hand form a uniformly random 4-card subset of these 16; the other 9 cards are non-honors and do not affect the high-card point total.\n\nLet \\(a,k,q,j\\) be the number of A, K, Q, J in the 4-card honor subset; then\n\\[\na+k+q+j = 4,\\quad a,k,q,j \\ge 0,\n\\]\nand the point total is\n\\[\n4a + 3k + 2q + j.\n\\]\nUsing \\(j = 4 - a - k - q\\), this becomes\n\\[\n4a + 3k + 2q + (4 - a - k - q)\n= 3a + 2k + q + 4.\n\\]\nWe require this to be at least \\(k=13\\):\n\\[\n3a + 2k + q + 4 \\ge 13 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad 3a + 2k + q \\ge 9,\n\\]\nwith \\(a+k+q \\le 4\\) (since \\(j \\ge 0\\)).\n\nEnumerating nonnegative integer solutions with \\(a+k+q \\le 4\\) and \\(3a+2k+q \\ge 9\\) yields these valid compositions \\((a,k,q,j)\\):\n\n1. \\((1,3,0,0)\\)\n2. \\((2,1,1,0)\\)\n3. \\((2,2,0,0)\\)\n4. \\((3,0,0,1)\\)\n5. \\((3,1,0,0)\\)\n6. \\((3,0,1,0)\\)\n7. \\((4,0,0,0)\\).\n\nFor each composition, the number of honor 4-card subsets is\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{a}\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{4}{q}\\binom{4}{j}.\n\\]\nComputing:\n\n1. \\((1,3,0,0)\\): \\( \\binom{4}{1}\\binom{4}{3}\\binom{4}{0}\\binom{4}{0} = 4 \\cdot 4 = 16\\)\n2. \\((2,1,1,0)\\): \\( \\binom{4}{2}\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{4}{0} = 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 = 96\\)\n3. \\((2,2,0,0)\\): \\( \\binom{4}{2}\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{4}{0}\\binom{4}{0} = 6 \\cdot 6 = 36\\)\n4. \\((3,0,0,1)\\): \\( \\binom{4}{3}\\binom{4}{0}\\binom{4}{0}\\binom{4}{1} = 4 \\cdot 4 = 16\\)\n5. \\((3,1,0,0)\\): \\( \\binom{4}{3}\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{4}{0}\\binom{4}{0} = 4 \\cdot 4 = 16\\)\n6. \\((3,0,1,0)\\): \\( \\binom{4}{3}\\binom{4}{0}\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{4}{0} = 4 \\cdot 4 = 16\\)\n7. \\((4,0,0,0)\\): \\( \\binom{4}{4}\\binom{4}{0}\\binom{4}{0}\\binom{4}{0} = 1\\).\n\nTotal “good” honor subsets:\n\\[\n16 + 96 + 36 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 197.\n\\]\n\nThe total number of 4-card honor subsets is \\(\\binom{16}{4} = 1820\\). Given exactly 4 honors in the hand, the probability the point total is at least 13 is therefore\n\\[\n\\frac{197}{1820},\n\\]\nwhich is already in lowest terms.\n\nSo the required conditional probability is \\(197/1820\\).\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"197/1820\"\n}",
