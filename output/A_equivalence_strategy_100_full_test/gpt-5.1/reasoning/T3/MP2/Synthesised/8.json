  "math_problem": "Find two lines of symmetry of the graph of the function $y=x+\\frac{1}{x}$. Express your answer as two equations of the form $y=a x+b$. Instead of determining the equations of the lines of symmetry, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote parallel to the y-axis, derived from the asymptotic analysis of the curve. Determine all triplets of real numbers $(x, y, z)$ satisfying the system of equations $x^{2} y+y^{2} z =k+1039$, $x^{2} z+z^{2} y =260$, $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) =-540$.",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing vertical asymptotes**\n\nI'm figuring out that the asymptote parallel to the y-axis is the vertical line x=0. Initially, I thought the form was y = ax + b, but that's not applicable here for vertical lines. Instead, the standard linear equation is Ax + By + C = 0, giving the coefficient vector as (A, B). For x=0, that's (1, 0), and its Euclidean norm is 1, meaning k=1. It feels like I'm working through this carefully to not miss any details!**Finding real triplets**\n\nI’m tackling a system of equations involving x, y, and z, specifically:\n\n1. \\( x^2y + y^2z = 1040 \\)\n2. \\( x^2z + z^2y = 260 \\)\n3. \\( (x-y)(y-z)(z-x) = -540 \\)\n\nThe equations have a symmetric quality, which gives me a clue on how to approach this. I think substituting or factoring might be useful. I also notice I need to treat x, y, z as nonzero. So, I’ll let \\( t = x^2 + yz \\) and rewrite my equations accordingly, feeling like I'm making progress!**Solving the linear system**\n\nI’m formulating a linear system from my earlier equations, which gives me \\( yt = 1040 \\) and \\( zt = 260 \\). Since \\( t \\neq 0 \\), I find that \\( y = \\frac{1040}{t} \\) and \\( z = \\frac{260}{t} \\), leading to \\( yz = \\frac{1040 \\times 260}{t^2} \\). With \\( t = x^2 + yz \\), I can establish a connection. It also tells me \\( y = 4z \\) when dividing. I realize \\( t \\) must be nonzero to avoid contradictions, and now I see how \\( t \\) relates to \\( z \\).**Continuing with substitutions**\n\nI'm working through earlier findings with the equations. I found that \\( yt = 1040 \\) leads to \\( t = \\frac{1040}{4z} \\) or \\( t = \\frac{260}{z} \\), so it’s consistent. Now, I’ve got \\( t = \\frac{260}{z} \\) and \\( t = x^2 + 4z^2 \\), which gives me \\( x^2 = \\frac{260}{z} - 4z^2 \\).\n\nNext, I’m applying the third equation: \\( (x-y)(y-z)(z-x) = -540 \\) and substituting \\( y = 4z \\). I’ll express things nicely, simplifying to form \\( 3z (x - 4z)(z - x) = 540 \\) and then consider substituting \\( x \\) in terms of \\( z \\) to move forward!**Finalizing the JSON response**\n\nI’ve confirmed that \\( z \\neq 0 \\) and mused about whether \\( y \\) can equal zero. The first equation leads to a contradiction if that were the case, so \\( y \\) must also be nonzero. It seems there are two real solutions to this system, namely the triplets \\( (16, 4, 1) \\) and \\( (1, 16, 4) \\). \n\nThe final task is to present these results correctly in JSON format. I’ll include both \\( k \\) and the triplets in an appropriate structured response, ensuring everything adheres to proper JSON formatting rules! Here’s what I’ll propose:\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"From the asymptotes and solving the system, we find k=1 and the two triplets.\",\n  \"answer\": \"k=1; (16,4,1), (1,16,4)\"\n}</think>\n\n{  \n  \"reasoning\": \"The graph of y=x+1/x has asymptotes x=0 and y=x; the asymptote parallel to the y-axis is x=0, which in the form Ax+By+C=0 has coefficient vector (1,0), whose Euclidean norm is k=1. Substituting k=1 into the system gives x^2y + y^2z = 1040 and x^2z + z^2y = 260. Treating x^2+yz as a common term shows y=4z, which reduces the system to equations in x and z alone. Introducing u=x/z and eliminating z yields a quadratic 4u^2−65u+16=0 with real solutions u=16 and u=1/4. Back-substitution gives (x,y,z) = (16,4,1) and (1,16,4), both of which satisfy all three original equations.\",\n  \"answer\": \"k=1; (16,4,1), (1,16,4)\"\n}",
