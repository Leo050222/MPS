  "math_problem": "Find all prime numbers $p,q,r$ , such that $\\frac{p}{q}-\\frac{4}{r+1}=1$ Instead of finding all prime numbers $p,q,r$ satisfying the given equation, simply find $n = r + 2009$, where $r$ is the prime number such that $r + 1$ equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term. FemtoPravis is walking on an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard that wraps around at its edges (so squares on the left edge of the chessboard are adjacent to squares on the right edge, and similarly for the top and bottom edges). Each femtosecond, FemtoPravis moves in one of the four diagonal directions uniformly at random. After $n$ femtoseconds, what is the probability that FemtoPravis is at his original location?",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Considering prime numbers and probabilities**\n\nI see that the text refers to \"r\" as a prime number, stating that \"r + 1 equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term.\" With the numerator being 4, I deduce that r must be 3. There may be an error regarding the denominator. However, I’ll move forward with it. Then, n equates to 2012 in a random walk on an 8x8 grid, with diagonal movement being equally probable. I'll model this mathematically using parity and group structure.**Analyzing movement parity and probabilities**\n\nI’m observing that x and y change by ±1 with each step, causing flips in parity—odd to even and vice versa. Since 2012 is even, returning to the original parity (even coordinates) is essential, but that's not solely enough for a return. I want to find the probability that the total steps equal (0,0) mod 8. The increments for x and y happen independently, with each direction equally likely. I’ll check the combinations and their probabilities to ensure everything aligns correctly.**Examining the 2D random walk**\n\nI’m considering how a 2D walk can be broken down into two independent 1D random walks in the x and y directions. Each step is ±1 mod 8, and I want to find the probability that both X_n and Y_n are congruent to 0. Since they're independent, I can express this as P1 squared, where P1 is the probability for the 1D walk. I need to analyze it as a symmetric random walk mod 8, which requires looking at congruence classes and using discrete Fourier transforms for efficiency.**Calculating probabilities for the random walk**\n\nFor x=0, I have the formula μ^{*n}(0) which simplifies to the sum of powers of λ_k. This gives me the probability P1 related to the cos values at specific k. I calculated the cos values for k from 0 to 7, resulting in a multiset. After simplifying, I found that P1 equals (1/4) plus a term involving 2 raised to the power of -n/2. Since n=2012 is even, I confirm that P1 effectively equals 1/4 plus an additional factor.**Finalizing the probability calculation**\n\nI started with the equation P1, leading to P1 = 1/4 + 2^{-1007}. After squaring this for the 2D probability, I expanded it to simplify the terms. I eventually factored it into a coherent form: P = (2^{2010} + 2^{1006} + 1) / 2^{2014}. Regarding r's values, I confirmed r must equal 3 from the context, yielding n = 2012. I’ll prepare the reasoning in JSON format, ensuring the explanation is concise and clear, expressing the final answer straightforwardly.</think>\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We reinterpret the instruction about r: the numerator of 4/(r+1) is 4, so r+1 = 4, giving r = 3 (which is prime). Therefore n = r + 2009 = 3 + 2009 = 2012.\\nOn the 8×8 toroidal board, represent positions as (x,y) in Z_8 × Z_8. Each diagonal move changes x by ±1 and y by ±1. The four diagonal directions give step vectors (±1,±1), each with probability 1/4. The x- and y-increments are independent and each is +1 or -1 with probability 1/2. Thus the 2D walk factors into two independent 1D simple symmetric random walks on Z_8.\\nLet P1 be the probability that a 1D walk on Z_8 (starting at 0, step ±1 with prob 1/2) is at 0 after n steps. Then the desired 2D probability is P = P1^2.\\nFor the 1D walk, use the character/Fourier representation. On Z_8, the step distribution μ has μ(1)=μ(7)=1/2. The eigenvalues for the convolution operator are λ_k = cos(2πk/8) = cos(πk/4) for k=0,...,7. The n-step probability to be at 0 is\\nP1 = (1/8) * Σ_{k=0}^7 λ_k^n.\\nThe values cos(πk/4) are {1, √2/2, 0, -√2/2, -1, -√2/2, 0, √2/2}. Grouping equal values, for n>0,\\nP1 = (1/8)[1^n + (-1)^n + 2( (√2/2)^n + (-√2/2)^n )].\\nWith n = 2012 even, (-1)^n = 1 and (-√2/2)^n = (√2/2)^n. Let a = √2/2 = 2^{-1/2}. Then a^n = 2^{-n/2} and\\nP1 = (1/8)[1 + 1 + 4·2^{-n/2}] = 1/4 + (1/2)·2^{-n/2}.\\nSince n = 2012, n/2 = 1006, so\\nP1 = 1/4 + 2^{-1007}.\\nThe 2D probability is\\nP = P1^2 = (1/4 + 2^{-1007})^2 = 1/16 + 2^{-1008} + 2^{-2014}.\\nCombining these over a common denominator 2^{2014},\\nP = (2^{2010} + 2^{1006} + 1) / 2^{2014}.\\nThis is the exact probability that FemtoPravis is back at the starting square after n = 2012 steps.\",\n    \"answer\": \"(2^{2010}+2^{1006}+1)/2^{2014}\"\n}",
