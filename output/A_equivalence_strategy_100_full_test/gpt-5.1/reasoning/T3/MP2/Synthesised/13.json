  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Calculating polynomial remainders**\n\nAlright, I'm checking the polynomial x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6, which factors nicely into (x-1)(x-2)(x-3). But since I'm working with x^{m} instead of x^3, I have a divisor of x^{m} - 6x^2 + 11x - 6. I need to solve for m based on a 4-digit square property while remembering that the remainder's degree must be less than m. I know the values of P(1), P(2), and P(3). At these roots, I’ll determine if they yield zero in the divisor.**Determining roots and squares**\n\nIt seems like 2 might not be a root unless m is equal to 3, and the same applies to x=3. Whether these values are roots depends on m, which I already need to determine. I’m focusing on finding a 4-digit square between 1000 and 9999 with digits only from 0 to 5. I will calculate possible numbers while considering that when I add 1 to each digit, the new number also needs to be a square. So, I’ll set n equal to a^2 and n + 1111 to b^2.**Finding square differences**\n\nNow, I need to analyze the gap between the squares: b^2 - a^2 = 1111, which factors to (b-a)(b+a)=1111. I factor 1111, finding pairs like 1*1111 and 11*101. For the first case where b-a=1 and b+a=1111, I find a six-digit result for a, so I discard that. In the second case, with b-a=11 and b+a=101, I get valid four-digit squares for 2025 and 3136. The values fit the digit criteria, leading me to conclude m equals 3. Now I can find the remainder of P divided by the polynomial.**Finding quadratic remainder**\n\nI’m using interpolation to find a quadratic polynomial R(x) with values R(1) = -4, R(2) = -1, and R(3) = 4. I set up a system of equations based on these values: a + b + c = -4, 4a + 2b + c = -1, and 9a + 3b + c = 4. By manipulating these equations, I find that a = 1, b = 0, and c = -5. Therefore, my remainder is R(x) = x^2 - 5. Now, I need to format this in JSON as well.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to ensure that I represent the polynomial string clearly as \"x^2-5\" with no extra spaces. The instructions also ask not to mention any differences or delta answers. I'll confirm that the JSON block is the last part of my response without any additional text before or after it. I’ll include concise reasoning in the \"reasoning\" field of the JSON output while following the provided example. Let's go ahead and create that JSON structure now!</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1) Let the 4-digit square be n = a^2. All digits of n are less than 6, and adding 1 to each digit gives another square. Adding 1 to each digit of a 4-digit number increases it by 1111, so the new square is a^2 + 1111 = b^2.\\n2) Thus b^2 - a^2 = 1111, so (b - a)(b + a) = 1111. Factor 1111: 1111 = 1·1111 = 11·101.\\n3) Solve the factor pairs:\\n   - If b - a = 1 and b + a = 1111, then b = 556, a = 555, giving a^2 = 308025 (not 4-digit, so reject).\\n   - If b - a = 11 and b + a = 101, then b = 56, a = 45, giving n = a^2 = 2025 and n + 1111 = 3136.\\n4) Check digits of n: 2025 has digits 2,0,2,5, all less than 6. Also 2025 and 3136 are squares (45^2 and 56^2), so this n works. Hence a = 45 and m = a - 42 = 3.\\n5) Now consider the polynomial P. We know:\\n   P(1) = -4, P(2) = -1, P(3) = 4.\\n   We must find the remainder when P is divided by x^m - 6x^2 + 11x - 6. With m = 3, the divisor is x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3).\\n6) When dividing by a cubic, the remainder R(x) has degree at most 2. Since P and R differ by a multiple of (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3), they have the same values at x = 1, 2, 3. So we need a quadratic R(x) such that:\\n   R(1) = -4, R(2) = -1, R(3) = 4.\\n7) Let R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. Then:\\n   a + b + c = -4,\\n   4a + 2b + c = -1,\\n   9a + 3b + c = 4.\\n   Subtracting equations gives 3a + b = 3 and 5a + b = 5, hence a = 1, b = 0, and then c = -5.\\n8) Therefore R(x) = x^2 - 5 is the unique quadratic satisfying the interpolation conditions, hence it is the remainder.\",\n  \"answer\": \"x^2-5\"\n}",
