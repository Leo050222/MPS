  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing polynomial remainders**\n\nI’m looking at polynomial g(t)=f(t) in relation to quadratic mod. The remainder r(t)=αt+β needs its degree to be less than 2. For distinct roots, f(x1) and f(x2) suggest α must be 0, meaning r(t) is constant. So, the remainder from dividing f(t) by q(t)=t²+t-A must have a zero linear coefficient. I’m setting t²=-t+A and will continue simplifying this. Okay, let’s compute t³ and t⁴ next!**Validating polynomial coefficients**\n\nI’m double-checking my work with the t⁴ expression: it expands to t * t³, leading to coefficients that line up correctly. I see that the coefficient of t is -(2A+1), which seems spot on. Now, substituting into f(t)=t⁴+3t³+5t gives me terms to work with.\n\nWhen I sum the coefficients, I find α = A + 7 and for β = A² - 2A. The condition for f(x1) and f(x2) to be equal is α = 0, which leads me to A = -7. Then I calculate k = A + 9, getting k = 2.**Evaluating the sum S**\n\nI’m evaluating the sum S = sum_{n=2}^{17} (n² + n + 1)/(n⁴ + 2n³ - n² - 2n) with k=2. After factoring the denominator, I find it simplifies to n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2). This leads to terms Tn being (n²+n+1)/[n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2)].\n\nI’m hoping to use partial fractions for telescoping, so I want to represent it as a difference of simpler fractions. I’m working on finding that representation now, and calculating the numerator over a common denominator seems the right next step!**Adding partial fractions**\n\nI'm diving into partial fractions by assuming Tn follows the form A/(n-1) + B/n + C/(n+1) + D/(n+2) and multiplying everything by the denominator. The expression becomes n²+n+1 = An(n+1)(n+2) + B(n-1)(n+1)(n+2) + Cn(n-1)(n+2) + Dn(n-1)(n+1). \n\nInstead of solving for A, B, C, and D, I’m thinking it might be simpler to use the telescoping nature. I notice that splitting into two fractions could work better. I’ll explore this strategy further!**Calculating the sum S**\n\nI’m working on the partial fraction decomposition for Tn, which indicates that the terms are linearly dependent, suggesting that I can use a clever approach focusing on simpler fractions. I proceed to deduce values for A, B, C, and D using specific values of n for quick computation. \n\nAfterward, I calculate sums using harmonic numbers and derive S, simplifying step by step until I find S_inner = 1184/969. Finally, I simplify this to get the irreducible fraction as my final answer, 592/969. Now I need to summarize my reasoning for the user!</think>\n\n{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We denote q(t) = t^2 + t - A, whose roots are x1 and x2. The condition x1(x1+1)=A and x2(x2+1)=A implies x1 and x2 are the two distinct roots of q(t)=0. For the quartic expression f(t) = t^4 + 3t^3 + 5t, equality f(x1)=f(x2) holds for distinct roots of q(t) exactly when the remainder of f(t) upon division by q(t) is constant (its linear coefficient is zero). Reducing powers of t modulo q(t)=0 shows that f(t) ≡ (A+7)t + (A^2 - 2A) mod q(t), so the linear coefficient vanishes when A+7=0, giving A=-7. Thus k = A + 9 = 2. Substituting k=2 into the sum gives terms (n^2 + n + 1)/(n^4 + 2n^3 - n^2 - 2n), for n from 2 to 17. Factoring the denominator as n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2), we decompose each summand into partial fractions: (n^2 + n + 1)/(n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2)) = (1/2)[1/(n-1) - 1/n + 1/(n+1) - 1/(n+2)]. This representation telescopes when summed from n=2 to 17, leaving only a few harmonic terms. Simplifying the resulting finite combination of reciprocals yields the exact sum 592/969.\",\n    \"answer\": \"592/969\"\n}",
