  "math_problem": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $N$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen. James writes down three integers. Alex picks some two of those integers, takes the average of them, and adds the result to the third integer. If the possible final results Alex could get are $(N - 86)$, 13, and 37, what are the three integers James originally chose?",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Crafting reasoning and answer**\n\nI'm planning to include \"reasoning\" alongside a clear explanation without a step-by-step breakdown. The user wants the three integers that were chosen, so I'd format the answer as \"-20, 28, 38\" without brackets. I need to mention N, which equals 128, in my reasoning. I'll point out that with 8 antigens, there are 256 distinct subsets, with each antigen appearing in half, hence N=128. Finally, I'll note set equality and quickly solve to yield the answer. I’ll return this in JSON format.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"There are 2^8 = 256 possible antigen subsets, so with each subset used exactly once by the 256 students, any given antigen appears in half of them: N = 2^7 = 128. Let James’s integers be a, b, c with sum S = a + b + c. Alex’s three possible results are (a + b)/2 + c, (a + c)/2 + b, and (b + c)/2 + a. Each can be written as (S + a)/2, (S + b)/2, (S + c)/2, and they are given to be 13, 37, and N − 86 = 42. Thus {S + a, S + b, S + c} = {26, 74, 84}. Summing these gives 4S = 184, so S = 46. Hence {a, b, c} = {26 − 46, 74 − 46, 84 − 46} = {−20, 28, 38}.\",\n  \"answer\": \"-20, 28, 38\"\n}",
