Let $x, y, n$ be positive integers with $n > k$. How many ordered triples $(x, y, n)$ of solutions are there to the equation $x^{n}-y^{n}=2^{100}$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing polynomial equations**\n\nI’m starting with k=0+1=1, but I’m wondering if that makes sense. So, they require n>k, which means n has to be at least 2. Next, I’ll tackle the equation x^n - y^n = 2^100 with n being a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. This feels a bit tricky, but I see in the text that p(x) is a polynomial in the scaled difference related to a function approximation. Once I adopt that, I can then look for ordered triples (x, y, n) where x > y.**Exploring factorization**\n\nI’m considering the factorization of x^n - y^n, which is (x - y)(x^{n-1} + ... + y^{n-1}) = 2^100. Since the right-hand side is a power of 2, both factors need to be powers of 2 as well. I let x - y = 2^a and S = x^{n-1}+...+y^{n-1} = 2^b, making sure a and b are non-negative, and that a + b = 100. I’ll also recall the lemma about gcd: it divides n. Given that both factors are powers of 2, that gcd indicates some useful restrictions.**Examining integer equations**\n\nI’m thinking about positive integers x and y, so I can express them as y = d * t and x = d * s, where gcd(s, t) = 1. This leads me to the equation d^n (s^n - t^n) = 2^100. Since the right side is a pure power of 2, it implies that d must also be a power of 2, and s^n - t^n must likewise be a power of 2. If s and t share no common factors greater than 1, I let d = 2^c, making s^n - t^n = 2^{100 - cn}. \n\nNow, when I consider parity, since s and t are relatively prime, the rules about even and odd come into play. If s is even and t is odd, then s^n is even and t^n is odd, resulting in an odd difference. However, because the right side is a pure power of 2, the only odd difference can be 1. The same holds true if s is odd and t is even. So, both scenarios lead to the conclusion that s^n - t^n must equal 1.**Identifying integer solutions**\n\nIf both s and t are odd, their difference is even, which suggests it could be a power of 2. However, if one is even and the other is odd, we find that s^n - t^n must equal 1. For coprime solutions, especially when n >= 2, I recall the result from Catalan's conjecture: the only solution is 3^2 - 2^3 = 1. When I look at n=2, I realize that s^2 - t^2 = (s-t)(s+t) cannot yield positive integers under these conditions. For n >= 3, s^n - t^n is at least 2^{n-1}, so that also can't equal 1. Hence, s and t must both be odd, but if they were both even, the gcd would be greater than 1, which isn't allowed. So, I conclude s and t must indeed be both odd.**Investigating odd integers and factorization**\n\nI’m considering the behavior of odd integers, noting that if s and t are odd, their difference s - t is even. When checking modulo conditions like mod 2, 4, and others, I find that s^n - t^n has some interesting implications. Factorizing s^n - t^n helps, and based on what I've gathered, the factors must also be even. \n\nMoreover, since both roots must be odd and coprime, their differences can only yield specific powers of 2. I’m trying to analyze constraints further, thinking about cases where one is odd while using Lifting The Exponent techniques to help establish some bounds and potentially eliminate impossible cases. The goal here is to identify if solutions exist for s and t that fulfill the original equation while considering their parity and coprimality.**Exploring number theory solutions**\n\nThis is definitely getting complicated with classification in number theory! I think we might need to enumerate possible values for n, with n being two or greater limited by magnitude. Given that 2^100 is a fixed upper bound, it feels like there are limitations on what n can be. If we assume x and y are pure powers of two, the approach runs into contradictions. Therefore, I'm considering other possibilities and methods like approaching odd factors or using Lifting The Exponent techniques for another angle. \n\nI'll analyze how odd integers behave in relation to constraints; still, it's clear that solutions might be limited or even nonexistent for these conditions. I should consider other avenues, such as exploring modular arithmetic, to potentially show there are no valid solutions left, especially for larger n.**Analyzing modular equations**\n\nI am looking at the equation s - t = 2^u and how it interacts with the gcd. The odd part of S cannot share factors with s - t beyond 2, but since S is a pure power of two, that works out fine. I think using geometric series could help with further decomposing S. I’ll express s and t in relative terms based on u and v, and ensure they remain odd coprimes. \n\nIt's clear I need to test combinations to unearth solutions, especially focusing on maintaining the integrity of both variables as odd integers. The pattern appears to be solid so far, but I need to refine this to see if any solutions can exist with larger constraints.**Evaluating polynomial relationships**\n\nI noticed the difference between the tangent line and the function equals zero at t=1, suggesting the numerator p(t) has a double root. However, it turns out p(1)=0 for the equality at tangency. I think k should remain as 1, but I’m unsure about the specific definitions used for p(x). It seems they may have chosen a complex approach just to conclude there's no integer solution for x^n - y^n = 2^100 when n >= 2. \n\nAnalyzing parity and applying gcd principles helps clarify this. I'll focus on bounded conditions for n and explore implications for smaller values, noting that larger integers will fall outside expected ranges.**Analyzing even n constraints**\n\nI’m exploring the condition that limits n to a maximum of 63, and I think combining valuations can help. If we consider m = v2(s^n - t^n), for s ≥ 3 and t ≥ 1, the difference's magnitude may be around 3^n. To reach a power-of-2 exponent of 100, we need n to be at least 63, since v2 of the difference is logarithmic. \n\nHowever, if I'm estimating v2 conditions, it implies that for small s and t, their growth cannot meet 100 without n being significantly large. Yet, that contradicts our earlier bounds. I realize I might need to rethink the evaluation conditions since odd powers limit both sides of the inequality.**Exploring solutions for even n**\n\nI'm analyzing the equation m = u + v + v2(n) - 1, where m is fixed at 100. Since u, v, and v2(n) are integers greater than or equal to 1, there are limited combinations that satisfy this. I think I might have overcomplicated things by assuming k = 1 is correct. \n\nI need to rethink the polynomial structure and the conditions for inequalities. It appears that for n = 2, we can have many integer solutions since the factors maintain even parity, but for n ≥ 3, the situation is more complex. I need to check for constraints and count the pairs based on these findings.**Counting solutions for n=2**\n\nI'm analyzing the number of ordered pairs (i, j) for the equation x^2 - y^2 = 2^100, where i ranges from 1 to 49. Each pair satisfies the conditions laid out, yielding 49 possible solutions. I initially thought there were 50 because I included i=0, but that was a miscalculation since y can't equal zero.\n\nNow, I need to establish if there are any solutions for n ≥ 3. Using Zsigmondy's theorem, which indicates that for n ≥ 3, solutions to x^n - y^n can't all be powers of 2, supports the conclusion that the only valid cases exist for n = 2. Thus, I can confidently state the solution count remains at 49.**Summarizing solution count**\n\nI determined that the number of (x,y) solutions for n=2 is 49. Checking the case when i=1 yields valid positive integers for x and y. I realized we must recognize the structure of the equations, with symmetric properties ensuring valid solutions. Importantly, by applying Zsigmondy's Theorem, I established that solutions for n≥3 can't exist, confirming that n=2 is the only case that matters. Thus, the total number of triples is 49. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The calculation shows that there are 49 (x,y) pairs yielding valid solutions for n=2.

Then:\\n  d^n(u^n - v^n) = 2^100.\\nSince the right side is a power of 2, d must be 2^c for some c, and u^n - v^n must also be a power of 2:\\n  u^n - v^n = 2^{100 - cn}.\\nHere u > v ≥ 1 and gcd(u, v) = 1.\\n\\nFor n ≥ 3, Zsigmondy’s Theorem (applied to u^n - v^n with gcd(u, v) = 1 and u > v) guarantees that, except for known small exceptions, u^n - v^n has a prime divisor that does not divide u^k - v^k for any smaller k. That primitive divisor must be odd (since u, v are odd or not both powers of 2 after factoring out the 2-part), so u^n - v^n cannot be a pure power of 2. The only exceptional case with n > 1 is (u, v, n) = (2, 1, 3), where u^3 - v^3 = 7, which is not a power of 2.
