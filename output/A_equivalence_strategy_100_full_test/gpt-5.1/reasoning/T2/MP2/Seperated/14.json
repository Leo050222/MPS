  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Processing user request**\n\nThe user is asking for step-by-step reasoning along with JSON output. While I can't share my entire thought process, I can summarize it. \n\nFor Problem 1, they want to find e = floor(550/12) - 43. So, I calculated that floor(550/12) equals 45, hence e = 2. \n\nFor Problem 2, I need to find primes p such that 5p = floor(n^2/5). That involves working with the equation n^2 = 25p + k, where k can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.**Analyzing quadratic residues**\n\nI'm looking into finding primes p where n^2 ≡ k (mod 25). It suggests p = (n^2 - k) / 25 must be an integer prime. I remember the residues for squares mod 25 are 0, 1, 4, 6, 9, 11, 14, 16, 19, 21, 24 – and I verified them.\n\nSo, n^2 mod 25 equals k mod 25, limiting k to quadratic residues: 0, 1, and 4. Cases for k being 0, 1 allow further exploration of n, determining odd/even conditions. The factorization approach could help solve this systematically.**Exploring factors and primes**\n\nI'm analyzing the factorization relation of primes multiplied by 25, specifically considering odd pairs differing by 2. The breakdown involves possibilities like (1, 25p) or (5, 5p), or (25, p). \n\nFor each case, I check if they satisfy the condition of differing by 2. For example, with (25, p), I found that if p = 23, it works well as a candidate because it satisfies the original requirements. \n\nFor k = 4, I look at n^2 = 25p + 4, exploring its properties modulo 4, leading to further checks on its validity.**Examining prime parity**\n\nI'm looking into the parity of p, knowing that if p is odd (excluding 2), then p must be congruent to 1 or 3 mod 4. Consequently, n^2 must align with that as well. However, n^2 can only be 0 or 1 mod 4, meaning p should be 1 mod 4.\n\nFor factorization, I set up the equation n^2 - 4 = 25p. I’ll let n be even, indicating n = 2m. The factors differ by 4, so I explore positive integers a and b with the product 25p. It leads me to analyze 25p divided by several positive divisors to check for valid primes.**Summarizing the findings**\n\nI’ve determined that p = 29 is a candidate since it works out with a = 25 and b = 29, leading to n = 27 and a valid equation check. After looking at various divisors and their implications, only p = 29 remains valid. This gives us the primes 23 and 29, concluding with a sum of 52. \n\nSince the user asked for step-by-step reasoning but policy limits what I can share, I’ll provide a concise summary in the JSON format.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, compute floor(550/12) = 45, then e = 45 - 43 = 2.
