      "A2098": "Wendy eats sushi for lunch. She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, but sushi is sticky, and Wendy can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi, assuming that the pieces of sushi are distinguishable? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row."

  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Parsing grid positions**\n\nI need to analyze a 2x3 rectangular grid that’s labeled A, B, C on the top row and D, E, F on the bottom row. The bottom-right piece is F. The induced subgraph will represent the adjacency of the pieces, with edges between orthogonally adjacent ones. After removing the endpoints A and C from the graph, I'm left with B, D, E, and F. Looking at piece F, it’s only adjacent to E, giving it a degree of 1. Thus, k = 1 + 0 = 1, so the answer is \"1.\"**Double-checking adjacency**\n\nI'm verifying the adjacencies in the grid. D is adjacent to A (above) and E (to the right), while E connects to B (above), D (left), and F (to the right). F is adjacent to C (above) and E (left). After removing A and C, the edges from D to A and from F to C are gone, leaving the other connections intact. This gives F a degree of 1.\n\nMoving on to Problem 2: I have to find the probability of forming an obtuse triangle with random side lengths a, b, and 1. For a valid triangle, all side lengths must satisfy the triangle inequality. Let’s break this down systematically to understand it better.**Analyzing triangle inequalities**\n\nI'm going through the triangle inequalities for sides a, b, and 1.\n\nFirst, I have a + b > 1. Then, a + 1 > b holds true since b is capped at 1 and a is at least 0. The only potential violation is when b would equal a + 1, which can't happen as b can't exceed 1. The strict inequality fails only when a is 0 and b is 1. \n\nFor 1 + b > a, this only fails when b is 0 and a is 1. Since we're dealing with continuous distributions, these violation cases are measure-zero events, meaning they have a probability of zero.**Defining effective region for triangle**\n\nI've established that the effective region for forming a triangle requires a + b > 1 and both a and b must be greater than 0, since having either as zero means no triangle can be formed. This defines a domain within the unit square [0,1]^2, where the area above the line a + b = 1 is 1/2.\n\nNext, I'm considering the obtuse triangle condition. For a triangle with sides a, b, and 1, the largest side corresponds to the largest angle. An obtuse triangle has one angle greater than 90°, which means the square of the largest side must exceed the sum of the squares of the other two. If 1 is the largest side, it’s always true that 1 ≥ a and 1 ≥ b, although there might be ties when a or b equals 1. Let’s check the inequalities further, but clearly, 1 is the maximum or tied for maximum side.**Calculating area for obtuse triangles**\n\nFor an obtuse triangle, it’s sufficient that the square of the largest side is greater than the sum of the squares of the other sides. In this case, the largest side is 1, ensuring that 1^2 > a^2 + b^2, or a^2 + b^2 < 1 holds true. However, we must also satisfy the triangle inequality a + b > 1. \n\nNext, I need to figure out the overlap between the area defined by a + b > 1 and the interior of the quarter-circle a^2 + b^2 < 1 in the first quadrant. I confirm that the intersection is non-empty, and I’ll integrate to find the area above the line a + b = 1 within the quarter-circle. Overall, I'm aiming to establish the area of this wedge and then compute it using integration.\n\nLet's transform the coordinates for ease, and I’ll be setting up the integral as I go. I can express the area as the integral of the shape confined by the circle and the line within the unit square. The quarter-circle has an area of π/4, but I must subtract the area below the line a + b = 1 to just get the area above it.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI’m calculating the area of the quarter circle and the triangle formed by the lines, arriving at the expression for probability. The probability that randomly chosen sides produce an obtuse triangle is given by the area of the intersection divided by the area of the square. The final answers can simply be \"pi/4 - 1/2.\"\n\nFor the JSON structure, I need to ensure I provide the reasoning in a concise way without the full detailed steps. I’ll focus on describing the grid and how the triangle inequality dictates the conditions for obtuseness, while keeping it clean and clear.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Model the 2x3 grid as a graph where vertices are sushi pieces and edges join orthogonally adjacent pieces. Label the top row A, B, C (left to right) and the bottom row D, E, F. The bottom-right piece is F. After first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row (A and C), remove A and C and their incident edges. Originally, F is adjacent to E (left) and C (above). With C removed, only the edge F–E remains, so the degree of F in the induced subgraph on the remaining vertices is 1. Thus k = deg(F) + 0 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: For sides a, b, and 1 with a, b independently uniform on [0,1], the triangle inequalities almost surely reduce to a + b > 1, since the other inequalities fail only on measure-zero boundary points. Because a, b ≤ 1, side 1 is (almost always) the longest side, so the triangle is obtuse exactly when 1^2 > a^2 + b^2, i.e. a^2 + b^2 < 1. In the unit square 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 1, the valid triangles lie in the region a + b > 1. The obtuse ones lie in the intersection of this half-plane with the quarter-disk a^2 + b^2 < 1. This region has area ∫_0^1 [sqrt(1 - x^2) - (1 - x)] dx = (π/4) - 1/2. Since the total area of the square (and hence the sample space) is 1, this area is the desired probability.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"pi/4 - 1/2\"\n}",
