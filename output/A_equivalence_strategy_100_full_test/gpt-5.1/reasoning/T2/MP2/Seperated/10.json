  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Analyzing probability with faces**\n\nI'm exploring a scenario where we've collected k distinct faces in a set S. The last roll results in one of those faces, and the next roll must be from the remaining faces. I find the new faces are calculated as 6 - k. Excluding the last rolled face, old options consist of k-1. \n\nCalculating the probability that the next roll is a new face yields (6-k)/5, applicable for k less than 6. For k=0, the first roll always results in a new face.**Calculating expected rolls**\n\nI’m considering a process where I start with zero collected faces. After the first roll, I move to k=1. For each roll when 1≤k≤5, I can add a new face with a probability of p_k=(6-k)/5. If I don’t add a new face, I remain at the same k with a probability of 1-p_k=(k-1)/5. \n\nThis setup resembles a negative binomial distribution, and I can infer that my expected rolls from k to 6 is the sum over the expected additional rolls for each k. Overall, I’ll have E_total = 1 (the first guaranteed roll) plus the sums of 1/p_k from k=1 to 5.**Clarifying expected rolls calculation**\n\nI need to point out that for k=1, the probability p_1 is 1, meaning I expect to roll just once to go from 1 to 2. Here, since there's only one value, the next roll must be a new face, ensuring I transition from k=1 to k=2 in one roll.\n\nNow, for k=5, the probability p_5 is 1/5, so it makes sense that I’d expect to roll five times to get that last unseen face. \n\nI’ve calculated the reciprocal of probabilities for k values: k=1 through k=5. Adding these yields the expectations I need. When I sum these, I also need to remember to include the initial roll as I finalize my total expected rolls.**Calculating expected total rolls**\n\nI'm considering a different perspective where the expected total rolls, E, is the sum of waiting times to acquire each new face.  \n\nFor the first new face, I know it takes 1 roll because it’s guaranteed. For subsequent distinct faces, if I have j-1 distinct results, the probability of rolling a new face is p_{k}=(6-k)/5. Thus, the expected extra rolls for each new face is calculated as 1/p_{j-1}. When I sum these, I confirm no double counting on the first face.  \n\nCalculating gives me a total of 149/12 as the expected number of rolls to get all distinct faces.**Comparing collection expectations**\n\nI’m evaluating the plausibility of my expected rolls of 149/12 against the ordinary coupon collector problem where expectation is 6 multiplied by H_6. That calculation gives 14.7, and since my expectation is around 12.42, it’s smaller, which makes sense because the restriction of not repeating speeds up the collection process.\n\nNow, I'll package the reasoning concisely without going into exhaustive detail, while ensuring to maintain clarity. I’ll describe the two problems briefly in logical steps and prepare the JSON format.</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Set a + sqrt(b) = sqrt(15 + sqrt(216)), square both sides, and equate rational and irrational parts. This implies sqrt(b) must be proportional to sqrt(6), so write b = 6c^2 for an integer c and solve the resulting equations. The only valid integer solution is a = 3, b = 6, so k = a + 3 = 6. Problem 2: Track only the number k of distinct faces seen so far, using symmetry. After the first roll (which always yields a new face), when k distinct faces have appeared, the next roll cannot repeat the last face and is equally likely to be any of the other 5 faces. Among those 5, there are 6 - k unseen faces and k - 1 already seen (but not equal to the last), so the chance the next roll is a new face is (6 - k)/5. The expected number of rolls to increase from k to k + 1 distinct faces is therefore 1 / ((6 - k)/5) = 5/(6 - k). Summing these waiting times for all k and including the first roll gives a total expected number of rolls equal to 149/12.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"149/12\"\n}",
