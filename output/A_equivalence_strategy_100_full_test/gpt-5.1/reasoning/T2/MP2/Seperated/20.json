  "reasoning_content": "<think>**Finding the value of k**\n\nIt seems that I need to determine a fixed constant \\( k \\) so that for every positive integer \\( n \\) that makes the fraction an integer, the expression holds true: \\( n = \\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7} + k \\). So, I need to focus on finding a unique positive integer \\( k \\) such that whenever \\( \\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7} \\) is an integer, adding \\( k \\) gives me \\( n \\). Let’s denote \\( f(n) \\) as this fraction and set up my equations accordingly.**Exploring solutions for n**\n\nI need to find positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\) is an integer, while \\( n - f(n) \\) remains constant. It's possible that there are multiple values for \\( n \\) with the same difference, or maybe just one, making \\( k \\) equal to \\( n - f(n) \\). The phrasing suggests they expect more than one \\( n \\) to satisfy the condition. So, I’ll address the Diophantine equation to ensure \\( f(n) \\) is an integer. I’ll perform polynomial long division to derive expressions for further analysis.**Determining conditions for n**\n\nI need to ensure that \\( n^2 + 7 \\) divides \\( 7n - 3 \\). I’ll check the gcd of \\( n^2 + 7 \\) and \\( n \\) by examining \\( n^2 + 7 \\equiv 7 \\mod n \\). Since it divides \\( 7n - 3 \\), it should also divide any linear combination of these expressions. But, instead of complicating things with that, I’ll consider checking small integer solutions, given the constraints. I’ll solve the inequalities to find valid integers for \\( n \\). Case one shows \\( n = 3/7 \\) isn’t valid, so I’ll investigate \\( |7n - 3| \\) further.**Solving the inequalities**\n\nI need to solve two inequalities involving \\( n \\):\n\nFirst, for \\( 7n - 3 \\geq n^2 + 7 \\), simplifying gives \\( 0 \\geq n^2 - 7n + 10 \\), which factors to \\( (n - 5)(n - 2) \\leq 0 \\). This means \\( 2 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\).\n\nFor the second, \\( 3 - 7n \\geq n^2 + 7 \\) leads to \\( 0 \\geq n^2 + 7n + 4 \\). The discriminant helps find that there are no positive integers satisfying this. \n\nFinally, I check \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\) for integer values, confirming that only \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\) yield positive integers from the expression. Now I need to find that corresponding \\( k \\) for these values!**Finding k and values of m**\n\nFor \\( k \\), I determined that it must equal 1 for both \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\), so that's my unique solution. Now, for the second problem, I need to find \\( m \\) such that the roots \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) of the equation \\( 2x^2 - mx - 8 \\) differ by \\( m - 1 \\). After implementing calculations for the discriminant and checking conditions for real, distinct roots, I found that the values for \\( m \\) include both \\( 6 \\) and \\( -\\frac{10}{3} \\). I'll present my final answer as \"6, -10/3\".**Crafting JSON reasoning**\n\nThe user wants me to provide a step-by-step explanation but in a concise manner, suitable for the required JSON format. I'll summarize the key equations without detailed calculations. For Problem 1, I found that testing \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\) gives values leading to \\( k = 1 \\). In Problem 2, I derived the distance between the roots and solved the quadratic equation to find \\( m = 6 \\) and \\( m = -\\frac{10}{3} \\). \n\nHere's the final JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"For Problem 1, testing small n gives n=2 and n=5, whose values are 1 and 4, and in both cases n - value = 1, so k=1. For Problem 2, the distance between roots is sqrt(m^2+64)/2; setting this equal to |m-1| and solving the resulting quadratic gives m=6 and m=-10/3.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6, -10/3\"\n}</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Perform polynomial division to write (n^3+3)/(n^2+7) = n + (3-7n)/(n^2+7). For the expression to be an integer, n^2+7 must divide 3-7n. This can only happen for small positive n; checking these gives n=2 and n=5 as the only solutions. The corresponding integer values of the expression are 1 and 4, so in both cases n equals the expression value plus 1, hence k=1. Problem 2: For 2x^2 - mx - 8, the roots differ by |r1 - r2| = sqrt(m^2 + 64)/2. Setting this equal to |m - 1| and solving the resulting quadratic equation 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0 yields m = 6 and m = -10/3, both of which make the difference between the roots equal to m - 1 up to sign.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6, -10/3\"\n}",
