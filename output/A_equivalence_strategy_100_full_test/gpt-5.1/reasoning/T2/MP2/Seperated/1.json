  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The function satisfies f(ab) = f(a) + f(b), and f(n) = 0 if n is perfect or if n ends in 4. Since 4 ends in 4 and 4 = 2·2, we have 0 = f(4) = f(2) + f(2) = 2f(2), so f(2) = 0. The number 74 ends in 4 and equals 2·37, so 0 = f(74) = f(2) + f(37) = 0 + f(37), giving f(37) = 0. Therefore k = f(37) + 0 = 0. Problem 2: A path from (0,0) to (4,4) with steps (1,0) and (0,1) that never goes to y > x is a Dyck path of semilength 4. The number of such paths is the 4th Catalan number, C_4 = 14.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"14\"\n}",
