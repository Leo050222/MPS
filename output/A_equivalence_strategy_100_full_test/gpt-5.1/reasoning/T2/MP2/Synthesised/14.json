  "math_problem": "Victoria wants to order at least 550 donuts from Dunkin' Donuts for the HMMT 2014 November contest. However, donuts only come in multiples of twelve. Assuming every twelve donuts cost $7.49, what is the minimum amount Victoria needs to pay, in dollars? Instead of computing the minimum cost to acquire at least the required number of units when purchases are constrained to multiples of the base quantity, simply find $e = \\left\\lfloor 550 / 12 \\right\\rfloor - 43$. There are two prime numbers $p$ so that $5 p$ can be expressed in the form $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n^{e}}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ for some positive integer $n$. What is the sum of these two prime numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First compute e = floor(550 / 12) - 43 = 45 - 43 = 2. We then need primes p such that 5p = floor(n^2 / 5) for some integer n, i.e., 25p ≤ n^2 < 25p + 5. This forces n^2 to be 25p + 1 or 25p + 4. Solving n^2 = 25p + 1 and n^2 = 25p + 4 in integers and requiring p to be prime yields p = 23 and p = 29. Their sum is 52.\",\n    \"answer\": \"52\"\n}",
