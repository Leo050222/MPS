What would the same MP3 player sell for if it was on sale for $30 \\%$ off of its original price? Instead of computing the sale price under the alternative discount percentage, simply find $k = R - 128$, where $R$ is the original price of the MP3 player determined from the given sale price after the initial discount."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: A 20% reduction means the sale price is 80% of the original price R. So 0.8R = 112. Solve for R: R = 112 / 0.8 = 112 ÷ (8/10) = 112 × (10/8) = 112 × (5/4) = (112/4) × 5 = 28 × 5 = 140. We are asked for k = R − 128, so k = 140 − 128 = 12.\\n\\nProblem 2: (x + m)(x + n) expands to x^2 + (m + n)x + mn. The constant term is mn, and we are told this constant term is −12. So we need integer pairs (m, n) with mn = −12. The integer factor pairs of −12 are: (1, −12), (−1, 12), (2, −12/2 = −6), (−2, 6), (3, −4), (−3, 4). Thus possible values for m (from all pairs) are: 1, −12, −1, 12, 2, −6, −2, 6, 3, −4, −3, 4. Any candidate value of m that is not in this set cannot occur. Therefore, among any given options, the one not in {1, −12, −1, 12, 2, −6, −2, 6, 3, −4, −3, 4} cannot be a value of m.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"12\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"value of m must be an integer divisor of -12; any integer not in {1,-12,-1,12,2,-6,-2,6,3,-4,-3,4} cannot be a value of m\"\n}",
