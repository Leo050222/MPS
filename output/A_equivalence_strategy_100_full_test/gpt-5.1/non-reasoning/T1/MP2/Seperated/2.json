We are told this equals 27, so 3m = 27, giving m = 9. We are asked not for the product, but for p = 100(m - 177/20). Substitute m = 9. First convert 9 to twentieths: 9 = 180/20. Then m - 177/20 = 180/20 - 177/20 = 3/20. Thus p = 100 * (3/20) = (100/20)*3 = 5*3 = 15.\\n\\nProblem 2: “x% of 60 is 12” means (x/100) * 60 = 12. Simplify: 60x/100 = 12. Reduce 60/100 to 3/5, so (3/5)x = 12. Solve for x: x = 12 * (5/3) = 60/3 = 20. We need 15% of x: (15/100)*x = 0.15 * 20. Compute 15 * 20 = 300, then divide by 100 to get 300/100 = 3. So 15% of x is 3.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"15\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
