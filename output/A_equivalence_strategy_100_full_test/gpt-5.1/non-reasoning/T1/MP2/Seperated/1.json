Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day."

Compute the remainder when 100 is divided by 24. 24×4 = 96, and 100 − 96 = 4, so the remainder h = 4. We are asked to find k = h + 7, so k = 4 + 7 = 11.\\nProblem 2: We need three different numbers from {2, 3, 4, 6} whose sum is 11. Check combinations: 2+3+4 = 9, 2+3+6 = 11, 2+4+6 = 12, 3+4+6 = 13. The correct triple is 2, 3, and 6. Their product is 2×3×6 = 36.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"36\"\n}",
