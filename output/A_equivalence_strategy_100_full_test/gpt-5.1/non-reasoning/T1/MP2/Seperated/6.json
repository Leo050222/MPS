For a fixed sum, the product is maximized when the numbers are as close as possible. Since 31 is odd, the closest integers are 15 and 16. Compute the product: 15 × 16 = 240. We are asked to find k, which is this maximum product minus 231. So k = 240 − 231 = 9.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need to count the lattice points (points with integer coordinates) on the line segment from (−9, −2) to (6, 8), including endpoints. A known result: the number of lattice points on a segment between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is gcd(|x2 − x1|, |y2 − y1|) + 1. Compute the coordinate differences: |x2 − x1| = |6 − (−9)| = |15| = 15 and |y2 − y1| = |8 − (−2)| = |10| = 10. Then gcd(15, 10) = 5. Therefore, the number of lattice points on the segment is 5 + 1 = 6.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
