There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe are told the ratio of skateboards to bicycles is 7:4. Let the scaling factor be k, so the number of skateboards is 7k and the number of bicycles is 4k. We also know there are 12 more skateboards than bicycles.\\nSet up the equation using the difference:\\n7k - 4k = 12\\n3k = 12\\nk = 4\\nWe are asked not for the total number, but for d = k + 6. Substitute k = 4:\\nd = 4 + 6 = 10.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nInitial counts: red = 10, yellow = 7, blue = 3. After eating some candies, the numbers of red, yellow, and blue remaining are equal. Let this common remaining number be n.\\nConstraints:\\n0 ≤ n ≤ 3 because blue starts at 3 and can only decrease, so the maximum common remaining value is 3.\\nAlso n must be ≤ 7 and ≤ 10 automatically, so 0 ≤ n ≤ 3.\\nNumber eaten of each color:\\nred eaten = 10 - n\\nyellow eaten = 7 - n\\nblue eaten = 3 - n\\nTotal eaten = (10 - n) + (7 - n) + (3 - n) = 20 - 3n.\\nWe want the smallest possible total eaten, so we want to maximize n subject to the constraints, i.e., n = 3.\\nCompute total eaten:\\nTotal eaten = 20 - 3 * 3 = 20 - 9 = 11.\\nThus the smallest possible number of candies Shuxin ate is 11.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
