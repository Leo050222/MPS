Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The hard drive is 300 GB. Convert GB to MB using 1 GB = 1024 MB. So the total capacity in MB is C = 300 × 1024. Compute 300 × 1024: 1024 × 100 = 102400, so 1024 × 300 = 3 × 102400 = 307200. Thus C = 307200 MB. We are asked not for the remaining empty space, but for d = C − 307100. Substitute C: d = 307200 − 307100 = 100.\\n\\nProblem 2: The bicycle’s regular price is $320 with 20% off. Compute the discount: 20% of 320 is 0.20 × 320 = 64, so sale price for the bike is 320 − 64 = 256. The helmet’s regular price is $80 with 10% off. Compute that discount: 10% of 80 is 0.10 × 80 = 8, so sale price for the helmet is 80 − 8 = 72. The total regular price for both items is 320 + 80 = 400. The total sale price is 256 + 72 = 328. The total savings is 400 − 328 = 72. To find the percentage savings on the total purchase, compute (savings / regular total) × 100% = (72 / 400) × 100%. First simplify 72 / 400: divide numerator and denominator by 8 to get 9 / 50. Then (9 / 50) × 100% = 9 × 2% = 18%. So Sandra’s percentage savings on the total purchase is 18%.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"18\"\n}",
