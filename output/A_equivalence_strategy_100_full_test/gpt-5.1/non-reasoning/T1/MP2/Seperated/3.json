  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Solve 10d + 8 = 528. Subtract 8 from both sides: 10d = 528 - 8 = 520. Divide both sides by 10: d = 520 / 10 = 52. The problem says: instead of determining 2d, find the race distance s equal to that solution plus 48. The solution to the equation is d = 52, so s = d + 48 = 52 + 48 = 100.\\nProblem 2: The race distance is 100 m. Megan's average speed is v_M = 5/4 m/s. Megan's time: t_M = distance / speed = 100 / (5/4) = 100 * (4/5) = 400/5 = 80 seconds. Hana finished 5 seconds before Megan, so Hana's time is t_H = t_M - 5 = 80 - 5 = 75 seconds. Hana's average speed is v_H = distance / time = 100 / 75 = 4/3 m/s after simplifying the fraction (divide numerator and denominator by 25: 100/75 = 4/3).\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"4/3\"\n}",
