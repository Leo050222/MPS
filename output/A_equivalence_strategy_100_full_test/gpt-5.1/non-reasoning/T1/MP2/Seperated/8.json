  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We are given positive integers x and y with x > y and the equation x + x*y = 391. Factor the left side: x + x*y = x(1 + y). So we have x(1 + y) = 391. Since x and y are positive integers, x and (1 + y) must be positive integer factors of 391. Factor 391: 391 = 17 * 23. The positive factor pairs of 391 are (1, 391), (17, 23), (23, 17), and (391, 1). We interpret these as x * (1 + y) = 391, so possible assignments are: (x, 1 + y) = (1, 391), (17, 23), (23, 17), (391, 1). From each: 1) x = 1, 1 + y = 391 → y = 390 (but then x = 1 is not greater than y = 390, so x > y fails). 2) x = 17, 1 + y = 23 → y = 22, and x > y is 17 > 22, which is false. 3) x = 23, 1 + y = 17 → y = 16, and x > y is 23 > 16, which holds. 4) x = 391, 1 + y = 1 → y = 0, but y must be a positive integer, so this is invalid. Thus the only valid solution is x = 23, y = 16. The problem asks not for x + y but for k = y + 14. With y = 16, k = 16 + 14 = 30.\\n\\nProblem 2: There are 30 people in the room, 60% of whom are men. Number of men = 0.6 * 30 = 18. Then the number of women initially is 30 - 18 = 12. No men enter or leave, so the number of men stays 18. Let w be the number of women who enter. Then the new total number of people is 30 + w, and the new number of women is 12 + w. We want 40% of the total number of people to be men. That means the fraction of men must be 0.4: 18 / (30 + w) = 0.4. Convert 0.4 to fraction 2/5: 18 / (30 + w) = 2/5. Cross-multiply: 18 * 5 = 2 * (30 + w). That is 90 = 60 + 2w. Subtract 60 from both sides: 90 - 60 = 2w → 30 = 2w → w = 15. Therefore, 15 women must enter the room.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"30\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"15\"\n}",
