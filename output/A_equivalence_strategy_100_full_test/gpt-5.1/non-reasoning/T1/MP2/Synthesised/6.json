  "math_problem": "If $x$ and $y$ are positive integers with $x+y=31$, what is the largest possible value of $x y$? Instead of finding the largest possible value of the product $x y$, simply find $k$, which is that largest value minus 231. If a line segment joins the points $(-k,-2)$ and $(6,8)$, how many points on the line segment have coordinates that are both integers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n  \"reasoning\": \"We want positive integers x and y with x + y = 31 and to maximize xy. For a fixed sum, the product is maximized when the numbers are as close as possible. With 31 odd, the closest positive integers are 15 and 16. Then xy = 15 * 16 = 240. We are told to define k = (largest xy) - 231, so k = 240 - 231 = 9.\\n\\nNow consider the line segment joining points (-k, -2) and (6, 8). Since k = 9, the points are (-9, -2) and (6, 8).\\n\\nWe need the number of lattice points (points with both coordinates integers) on the line segment between (-9, -2) and (6, 8), including endpoints.\\n\\nUse the fact that the number of lattice points on a line segment between two lattice points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is gcd(|x2 - x1|, |y2 - y1|) + 1.\\n\\nHere, x1 = -9, y1 = -2, x2 = 6, y2 = 8.\\nCompute differences: |x2 - x1| = |6 - (-9)| = 15, |y2 - y1| = |8 - (-2)| = 10.\\nThen gcd(15, 10) = 5. Therefore, the number of integer-coordinate points on the segment is 5 + 1 = 6.\\n\\nThus, the final answer is 6.\",\n  \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
