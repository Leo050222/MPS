  "math_problem": "Storage space on a computer is measured in gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB), where $1 \\mathrm{~GB} = 1024 \\mathrm{MB}$. Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes. The regular price for a bicycle is $\\\\$320$. The bicycle is on sale for $20\\\\%$ off. The regular price for a helmet is $\\\\$80$. The helmet is on sale for $10\\\\%$ off. If Sandra bought both items on sale, her percentage savings on the total purchase is $\\left( \\frac{\\text{total savings}}{\\text{total price}} \\right) \\times d\\\\%$. Compute this value.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"1) Convert hard drive capacity to MB. Given 1 GB = 1024 MB and the drive is 300 GB: C = 300 × 1024 = 307200 MB. 2) Compute d = C − 307100 = 307200 − 307100 = 100. 3) Compute regular total price of items: bicycle $320, helmet $80, so total regular price = 320 + 80 = 400. 4) Compute sale prices and savings. Bicycle is 20% off: savings_bike = 0.20 × 320 = 64, sale_bike = 320 − 64 = 256. Helmet is 10% off: savings_helmet = 0.10 × 80 = 8, sale_helmet = 80 − 8 = 72. 5) Total savings = 64 + 8 = 72. Total sale price (total price actually paid) = 256 + 72 = 328. 6) Sandra’s baseline percentage savings on the total purchase is (total savings / total price) × 100% = (72 / 328) × 100%. 7) The problem defines her percentage savings to be (total savings / total price) × d%, with d = 100 from step 2. So the desired percentage is (72 / 328) × 100%. But multiplying by d% with d = 100 is equivalent to (72 / 328) × 100% because (total savings / total price) × d% = (72 / 328) × (100/100) = 72/328. Therefore the numeric value to compute is 72/328. 8) Simplify 72/328. Compute gcd(72, 328). 328 ÷ 8 = 41, so gcd is 8. Thus 72/328 = (72 ÷ 8) / (328 ÷ 8) = 9/41. 9) The exact final value for her percentage savings as defined is 9/41.\",\n    \"answer\": \"9/41\"\n}",
