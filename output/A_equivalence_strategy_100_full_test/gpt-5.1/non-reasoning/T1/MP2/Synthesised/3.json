  "math_problem": "Solve for $2d$ if $10d + 8 = 528$. Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance $s$ equal to that solution plus 48. Megan and Hana raced their remote control cars for $s$ m. The two cars started at the same time. The average speed of Megan's car was $\\frac{5}{4} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Hana's car finished 5 seconds before Megan's car. What was the average speed of Hana's car?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First solve the linear equation 10d + 8 = 528.\\n10d + 8 = 528\\n10d = 528 - 8 = 520\\nd = 520 / 10 = 52\\nWe were asked not to find 2d but instead define the race distance s as the solution plus 48:\\ns = d + 48 = 52 + 48 = 100\\nSo Megan and Hana each travel s = 100 m.\\nMegan's average speed is v_M = 5/4 m/s. Megan's time is\\nt_M = distance / speed = 100 / (5/4) = 100 * (4/5) = 80 s.\\nHana finishes 5 seconds before Megan, so Hana's time is\\nt_H = t_M - 5 = 80 - 5 = 75 s.\\nLet v_H be Hana's average speed. Then\\nv_H = distance / time = 100 / 75 = 4/3.\\nThus, Hana's average speed is 4/3 m/s.\",\n    \"answer\": \"4/3\"\n}",
