  "math_problem": "Consider the following flowchart: INPUT $\\rightarrow$ Subtract $8 \\rightarrow \\square \\rightarrow$ Divide by $2 \\rightarrow \\square$ Add $16 \\rightarrow$ OUTPUT. If the OUTPUT is 32, what was the INPUT? Instead of determining the initial input value that produces the specified output via the flowchart's sequence of operations, simply find $k = A - 26$, where $A$ is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step. What is the $y$-intercept of the line $y = x + 4$ after it is translated down $k$ units?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Let the input be x. After subtracting 8, we get x - 8. This passes to the first square; call this intermediate value A, so A = x - 8. Next, the flowchart divides by 2, giving A / 2, then some operation at the second square (which we don’t need explicitly), then adds 16 to produce the final output 32. So the total change from the result just before adding 16 to the output is +16. Therefore, the value just before adding 16 is 32 - 16 = 16. That value is the result of the second square, which comes from dividing A by 2. Thus A / 2, after whatever the second square does, ends up at 16. But the internal operation of the second square is not needed because the problem directly defines k in terms of A: k = A - 26. From A = x - 8, we compute k = (x - 8) - 26 = x - 34, but we still need a concrete x consistent with the flowchart. If we interpret the flowchart as standard linear operations with no additional change at the second square (i.e., the second square is just a placeholder, meaning the value flows through unchanged), then the operations are: subtract 8, divide by 2, add 16. The output is 32, so (x - 8)/2 + 16 = 32. Subtract 16 from both sides: (x - 8)/2 = 16, so x - 8 = 32 and x = 40. Then A = x - 8 = 32. Hence k = A - 26 = 32 - 26 = 6. The original line is y = x + 4, which has y-intercept 4. Translating the graph down by k units subtracts k from all y-values, so the new equation is y = x + 4 - k = x + 4 - 6 = x - 2. The y-intercept of this translated line is -2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-2\"\n}",
