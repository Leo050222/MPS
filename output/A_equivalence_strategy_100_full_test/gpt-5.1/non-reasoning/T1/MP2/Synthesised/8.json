  "math_problem": "If \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers with \\( x>y \\) and \\( x+x y=391 \\), what is the value of \\( x+y \\)? Instead of finding the sum of the two positive integers satisfying the given equation and inequality, simply find \\( k = y + 14 \\), where \\( y \\) is the smaller positive integer in the pair that solves the equation under the stated conditions. There are \\( k \\) people in a room, 60% of whom are men. If no men enter or leave the room, how many women must enter the room so that 40% of the total number of people in the room are men?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given positive integers x and y with x > y and the equation x + x y = 391. Factor the left side: x + x y = x(1 + y) = 391. Since 391 = 17 × 23, and x and y are positive integers with x > y, we consider factor pairs of 391: (1, 391), (17, 23), (23, 17), (391, 1), where we interpret x = factor1, 1 + y = factor2, so y = factor2 − 1. We need x and y positive integers and x > y. Test pairs:\\n- x = 1, 1 + y = 391 → y = 390, but then x = 1 is not > y = 390, so discard.\\n- x = 17, 1 + y = 23 → y = 22, and 17 > 22 is false, so discard.\\n- x = 23, 1 + y = 17 → y = 16, and 23 > 16 is true, so (x, y) = (23, 16) works.\\n- x = 391, 1 + y = 1 → y = 0 is not positive, so discard.\\nThus the valid pair is x = 23, y = 16. The problem then defines k = y + 14, so k = 16 + 14 = 30. Next, there are k people in a room, so initially there are 30 people, 60% of whom are men. Number of men: 0.6 × 30 = 18. Thus number of women initially is 30 − 18 = 12. Let w be the number of women who must enter. The number of men remains 18 (no men enter or leave). Total people after women enter is 30 + w, of which 18 are men. We want men to be 40% of the total: 18 = 0.4(30 + w). Solve for w: 18 = 0.4(30 + w) ⇒ 18 = 12 + 0.4w ⇒ 6 = 0.4w ⇒ w = 6 / 0.4 = 15. Therefore, 15 women must enter the room.\",\n    \"answer\": \"15\"\n}",
