  "math_problem": "What is the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region if a circular spinner is divided into six regions, four regions each have a central angle of $x^{\\circ}$, and the remaining regions have central angles of $20^{\\circ}$ and $140^{\\circ}$, where the shaded regions consist of the $140^{\\circ}$ region and two of the $x^{\\circ}$ regions? Instead of computing the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region, simply find $N = \\theta + 2700$, where $\\theta$ is the total central angle in degrees of the shaded regions. We call the pair $(m, n)$ of positive integers a happy pair if the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is a perfect square. For example, $(20, 24)$ is a happy pair because the greatest common divisor of 20 and 24 is 4. Suppose that $k$ is a positive integer such that $(205800, 35k)$ is a happy pair. What is the number of possible values of $k$ with $k \\leq N$?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"1) The circle is 360°. There are four regions of x°, plus 20° and 140°. So: 4x + 20 + 140 = 360 ⇒ 4x = 200 ⇒ x = 50.\\n2) Shaded regions are the 140° region and two of the x° regions. Total shaded angle: θ = 140 + 2·50 = 240.\\n3) N = θ + 2700 = 240 + 2700 = 2940.\\n4) We need the number of positive integers k with k ≤ N = 2940 such that (205800, 35k) is a happy pair, meaning gcd(205800, 35k) is a perfect square.\\n5) Compute gcd(205800, 35k). First factor the known integers.\\n   - 205800: factor stepwise.\\n     205800 = 2058·100\\n     2058 = 2·1029\\n     1029 = 3·343 = 3·7³\\n     So 2058 = 2·3·7³\\n     Then 205800 = 2·3·7³·100 = 2·3·7³·(2²·5²) = 2³·3·5²·7³.\\n   - 35 = 5·7.\\n   - 35k = 5·7·k.\\n6) Let k factor as k = 2^a · 3^b · 5^c · 7^d · r, where r is coprime to 2,3,5,7.\\n   Then 35k = 5·7·k has exponents: 2^a · 3^b · 5^{c+1} · 7^{d+1} · r.\\n7) gcd(205800, 35k) only involves primes 2,3,5,7 and has exponents:\\n   - For 2: min(3, a)\\n   - For 3: min(1, b)\\n   - For 5: min(2, c+1)\\n   - For 7: min(3, d+1)\\n   For gcd to be a perfect square, each of these four exponents must be even; there must be no contribution from r, so r = 1 (k has no primes beyond 2,3,5,7).\\n8) Determine allowed exponents:\\n   - 2: min(3, a) even ⇒ possible values are 0 or 2. If a ≤ 3, min(3,a) = a, so a ∈ {0,2}. If a ≥ 3, min(3,a) = 3 (odd), impossible. So a ∈ {0,2}.\\n   - 3: min(1, b) even ⇒ min(1,b) ∈ {0}. That requires b = 0 (since if b ≥ 1, min = 1 (odd)). So b = 0.\\n   - 5: min(2, c+1) even ⇒ possibilities:\\n       * If c+1 ≤ 2 ⇒ c ≤ 1. Then min(2, c+1) = c+1. For even: c+1 = 0 or 2, but c+1 ≥ 1, so c+1 = 2 ⇒ c = 1.\\n       * If c+1 ≥ 2 ⇒ c ≥ 1. Then min(2, c+1) = 2, which is even. So any c ≥ 1 works.\\n     Combine: c must be ≥ 1. Thus c ∈ {1,2,3,...}.\\n   - 7: min(3, d+1) even. Check possibilities:\\n       * If 0 ≤ d+1 ≤ 3 ⇒ d ∈ {0,1,2}. Then min(3,d+1) = d+1, which must be even ⇒ d+1 ∈ {0,2}. Since d+1 ≥ 1, only d+1 = 2 ⇒ d = 1.\\n       * If d+1 ≥ 3 ⇒ d ≥ 2. Then min(3,d+1) = 3 (odd), impossible.\\n     Only d = 1 works.\\n9) So k must be of form k = 2^a · 3^0 · 5^c · 7^1 with constraints: a ∈ {0,2}, c ≥ 1, and k ≤ 2940.\\n   That is k = 2^a · 5^c · 7 with a ∈ {0,2}, c ≥ 1, k ≤ 2940.\\n10) Case a = 0: k = 5^c · 7.\\n    We require 5^c·7 ≤ 2940 ⇒ 5^c ≤ 2940/7 = 420.\\n    Powers of 5: 5^1=5, 5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625.\\n    625 > 420, so c ∈ {1,2,3}. This gives 3 values.\\n11) Case a = 2: k = 2²·5^c·7 = 4·5^c·7 = 28·5^c.\\n    Require 28·5^c ≤ 2940 ⇒ 5^c ≤ 2940/28 = 105.\\n    Powers: 5^1=5, 5^2=25, 5^3=125.\\n    125 > 105, so c ∈ {1,2}. This gives 2 values.\\n12) Total valid k: 3 + 2 = 5.\\n13) Therefore, the number of possible values of k with k ≤ N is 5.\",\n    \"answer\": \"5\"\n}",
