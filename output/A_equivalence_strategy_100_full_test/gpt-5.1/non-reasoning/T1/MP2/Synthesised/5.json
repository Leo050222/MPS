  "math_problem": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$. Shuxin begins with $d$ red candies, 7 yellow candies, and 3 blue candies. After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining. What is the smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Let the number of skateboards be 7k and bicycles be 4k. We are told there are 12 more skateboards than bicycles: 7k - 4k = 12, so 3k = 12, giving k = 4. Then d = k + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10, so Shuxin starts with d = 10 red candies, 7 yellow candies, and 3 blue candies. Let the final equal number of candies of each color be n. Then: red eaten = 10 - n, yellow eaten = 7 - n, blue eaten = 3 - n. These must all be nonnegative integers, and the total eaten is (10 - n) + (7 - n) + (3 - n) = 20 - 3n. Also, n cannot exceed the smallest initial count, which is 3, so n ∈ {0,1,2,3}. We want the smallest possible total eaten, so we maximize n. Take n = 3. Then candies eaten = 20 - 3·3 = 20 - 9 = 11, and the remaining candies are 7 red, 4 yellow, and 0 blue, which are not equal, so n = 3 is invalid. Next try n = 2: total eaten = 20 - 3·2 = 20 - 6 = 14, and remaining are 8 red, 5 yellow, 1 blue, not equal. For n = 1: eaten = 20 - 3·1 = 17, remaining 9 red, 6 yellow, 2 blue, not equal. For n = 0: eaten = 20 - 0 = 20, remaining 10 red, 7 yellow, 3 blue, not equal. Thus we realize we misinterpreted: equal numbers of each color means the individual post-eating counts of each color are equal to the same n, but we must ensure that we can reach that state by eating whole candies. That requirement is already satisfied by the equations 10 - n ≥ 0, 7 - n ≥ 0, 3 - n ≥ 0; however, we additionally need that n is the same integer for all three colors. Our earlier failure suggests that choosing d = 10 gives no valid n. We must revisit d: d is determined uniquely by k via d = k + 6 and k = 4, so d = 10 is fixed. Thus the only way to have equal remaining counts is to find an integer n such that 10 - a = n, 7 - b = n, 3 - c = n for some nonnegative integers a, b, c (candies eaten per color), equivalent to a = 10 - n, b = 7 - n, c = 3 - n. These are nonnegative when n ≤ 3. Our enumeration showed none of n = 0,1,2,3 gives equal remaining counts across colors: (10,7,3), (9,6,2), (8,5,1), (7,4,0). Therefore, there is no way to eat only candies (no adding) to make the remaining counts equal starting from (10,7,3). This contradicts the statement that Shuxin does so. Because the skateboard/bicycle piece is standard, we check: 7k - 4k = 3k = 12 gives k = 4, so that part is correct. The contradiction indicates a misreading of the second sentence: it might mean Shuxin begins with d red, 7 yellow, 3 blue, then after eating some candies, the counts of each color remaining are equal to each other, not equal to their original counts. That is what we already assumed; thus the puzzle as written with d = 10 has no solution. However, Olympiad-style problems of this form generally intend us to choose d so that such an n exists and is minimal in terms of total candies eaten; in other words, we should interpret d not as fixed after the skateboard ratio, but as a parameter we can still adjust, even though earlier text defined it via k. If we instead treat d as variable and require that d red, 7 yellow, 3 blue can be reduced to equal remaining counts with minimal total eaten, we set final equal count to n, so eaten is (d - n) + (7 - n) + (3 - n) = d + 10 - 3n, minimized when n is as large as possible subject to 0 ≤ n ≤ 3 (smallest initial color). So n = 3 gives eaten = d + 10 - 9 = d + 1. The condition of equality asks only that n ≤ each initial count; there is no further restriction, so n = 3 is valid whenever d ≥ 3. The smallest possible eaten count is then d + 1. To have a numerical answer, we must use the earlier link d = k + 6 with k = 4, so d = 10, and the smallest possible number of candies eaten is 10 + 1 = 11.\",\n    \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
