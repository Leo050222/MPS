  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe need n ∈ Z⁺ such that (n³ + 3)/(n² + 7) is a positive integer. Let k be the integer value of the expression: k = (n³ + 3)/(n² + 7). Then\\nn³ + 3 = k(n² + 7) = k n² + 7k.\\nRearrange:\\n(1)  n³ - k n² - 7k + 3 = 0.\\nWe need positive integer solutions (n, k) with n² + 7 > 0, so k > 0.\\n\\nA direct way is to use polynomial division to express the fraction:\\n(n³ + 3)/(n² + 7) = n + (−7n + 3)/(n² + 7).\\nSo the expression is integer iff (−7n + 3)/(n² + 7) is integer. Denote t = (−7n + 3)/(n² + 7).\\nThen k = n + t. Since n² + 7 > |−7n + 3| for all positive integers n, the only way t can be an integer is if the numerator is 0.\\n\\nCheck inequality: for n ≥ 1,\\n n² + 7 − |−7n + 3| ≥ n² + 7 − (7n − 3) = n² − 7n + 10 = (n−5)(n−2).\\nFor n ≥ 5, (n−5)(n−2) ≥ 0, so n² + 7 ≥ |−7n + 3|.\\nFor small n, check directly:\\n n=1: n²+7=8, |−7n+3|=4, larger.\\n n=2: 11 vs 11, equal.\\n n=3: 16 vs 18, denominator smaller but still positive.\\n n=4: 23 vs 25, denominator smaller.\\n n=5: 32 vs 32, equal.\\nBut in any case, factor sizes show |t| < 1 when denominator strictly larger than numerator in magnitude, so t can only be integer if numerator =0 or in the equal-magnitude cases one must check explicitly. Safer is to inspect the small n where equality or reversal can happen.\\n\\nCompute t directly and require integer divisibility:\\n t = (−7n + 3)/(n² + 7).\\nWe need n² + 7 | (−7n + 3).\\nSince |−7n + 3| grows linearly and n² + 7 grows quadratically, for large n the only possibility is numerator 0. The potential exceptions are when n is small, which we can test explicitly.\\n\\n1) Set numerator 0:\\n −7n + 3 = 0 ⇒ n = 3/7, not an integer. So that gives no integer n.\\n\\n2) Check small n manually to see if the division is exact:\\n n=1: (1³+3)/(1²+7) = 4/8 = 1/2, not integer.\\n n=2: (8+3)/(4+7) = 11/11 = 1 (integer).\\n n=3: (27+3)/(9+7) = 30/16 = 15/8, not integer.\\n n=4: (64+3)/(16+7) = 67/23, not integer.\\n n=5: (125+3)/(25+7) = 128/32 = 4 (integer).\\n n=6: (216+3)/(36+7) = 219/43 (≈ 5.09), not integer.\\n For n ≥ 7, denominator is much larger than |−7n+3| and the fraction t has absolute value < 1 but nonzero, hence cannot be integer.\\n\\nThus the only positive integers n making the expression an integer are n = 2 and n = 5, and their corresponding integer values of the expression are:\\n n=2 ⇒ (n³+3)/(n²+7) = 1.\\n n=5 ⇒ (n³+3)/(n²+7) = 4.\\nThe problem’s wording: “Instead of finding all positive integers making the given rational expression a positive integer, simply find k, where k is the positive integer such that for each such positive integer, it equals the value of the expression plus k.”\\n\\nLet the expression value be E(n). For the n that work, we have E(2) = 1, E(5) = 4. We need a positive integer k such that, for each such positive integer (i.e., each allowed n), the positive integer n equals the value of the expression plus k:\\n n = E(n) + k.\\nSo k = n − E(n).\\nCheck for the two valid n:\\n For n=2: k = 2 − 1 = 1.\\n For n=5: k = 5 − 4 = 1.\\nThey match, so k = 1 works for all such n (and it is unique).\\nThus Problem 1 answer: k = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have quadratic 2x² − m x − 8. Let its roots be r₁ and r₂. We are told they differ by m−1, so |r₁ − r₂| = m−1. For quadratics ax² + bx + c, the distance between roots is |r₁ − r₂| = |√(b² − 4ac)| / |a|.\\nHere a = 2, b = −m, c = −8.\\nCompute discriminant:\\n Δ = b² − 4ac = (−m)² − 4·2·(−8) = m² + 64.\\nThe difference between roots:\\n |r₁ − r₂| = √(m² + 64) / 2.\\nWe are given that this equals m − 1 (the problem says “differ by m − 1”, which we treat as a positive difference, so we require m − 1 ≥ 0 ⇒ m ≥ 1).\\nSo equation:\\n √(m² + 64) / 2 = m − 1, with m ≥ 1.\\nMultiply both sides by 2:\\n √(m² + 64) = 2(m − 1).\\nRight-hand side must be nonnegative; for m ≥ 1, it is.\\nSquare both sides:\\n m² + 64 = 4(m − 1)² = 4(m² − 2m + 1) = 4m² − 8m + 4.\\nBring all terms to one side:\\n 0 = 4m² − 8m + 4 − (m² + 64)\\n   = 3m² − 8m − 60.\\nSo we solve 3m² − 8m − 60 = 0.\\nCompute discriminant: D = (−8)² − 4·3·(−60) = 64 + 720 = 784 = 28².\\nSo m = [8 ± 28]/(2·3) = [8 ± 28]/6.\\nThus two candidates:\\n m₁ = (8 + 28)/6 = 36/6 = 6.\\n m₂ = (8 − 28)/6 = −20/6 = −10/3.\\nNow we check the original condition with each m.\\n\\nCheck m = 6:\\n Difference between roots using formula: √(m² + 64)/2 = √(36 + 64)/2 = √100/2 = 10/2 = 5.\\n Also m − 1 = 6 − 1 = 5.\\nMatches, so m = 6 is valid.\\n\\nCheck m = −10/3:\\n m − 1 = −10/3 − 1 = −10/3 − 3/3 = −13/3, which is negative.\\nBut the difference between roots is a nonnegative quantity, so we would be equating a nonnegative value to a negative value. Thus this violates the interpretation “zeros differ by m−1” as a positive difference. Therefore we discard m = −10/3.\\n\\nHence the only value of m for which the zeros differ by m − 1 is m = 6.\\n\\nFinal results:\\n Problem 1: k = 1.\\n Problem 2: m = 6.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
