She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, but sushi is sticky, and Wendy can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi, assuming that the pieces of sushi are distinguishable? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nLabel the 2×3 grid as\\nA B C\\nD E F\\nwith A,B,C top row (left to right) and D,E,F bottom row. Sushi pieces are vertices of the grid graph with edges between orthogonally adjacent squares.\\n\\nThe problem defines k = deg(F) + 0 after removing the two endpoint pieces of the top row. The endpoints of the top row are A (top-left) and C (top-right). We first remove A and C from the graph and then consider the induced subgraph on the remaining vertices {B, D, E, F}. We need the degree of F in this induced subgraph.\\n\\nAdjacencies in the full grid:\\n- A adjacent to B and D\\n- B adjacent to A and C and E\\n- C adjacent to B and F\\n- D adjacent to A and E\\n- E adjacent to B and D and F\\n- F adjacent to C and E\\n\\nAfter removing A and C, remaining vertices are B, D, E, F. Recompute adjacencies restricted to these vertices:\\n- B is adjacent to E (its only remaining neighbor after A,C removed)\\n- D is adjacent to E\\n- E is adjacent to B, D, F\\n- F is adjacent only to E (C was removed)\\nSo in the induced subgraph, deg(F) = 1. Thus k = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe pick a,b independently and uniformly from [0,1]. We consider whether segments of lengths a,b,1 can form an obtuse triangle. First, they must form a triangle at all.\\n\\nTriangle inequality: with side lengths a,b,1, the longest side is 1 (since a,b ≤ 1). For a triangle, we need 1 < a + b. The other triangle inequalities, a < b + 1 and b < a + 1, automatically hold for a,b ∈ [0,1]. So the region of (a,b) giving any triangle is:\\n1 < a + b ≤ 2, with 0 ≤ a,b ≤ 1.\\nIn the unit square, the line a + b = 1 cuts off a right isosceles triangle of area 1/2; the region a + b > 1 inside the unit square is the upper-right triangle of area 1/2.\\n\\nNow for obtuse condition. Label sides as lengths a,b,1, with 1 the longest. Let C be the angle opposite side 1. By the Law of Cosines:\\n1^2 = a^2 + b^2 − 2ab cos C.\\nSo cos C = (a^2 + b^2 − 1) / (2ab), provided a,b > 0. The triangle is obtuse at angle C if C > 90°, i.e. cos C < 0, so\\n(a^2 + b^2 − 1) / (2ab) < 0.\\nSince a>0, b>0 in the interior, 2ab > 0, so this is equivalent to\\na^2 + b^2 − 1 < 0  ⇒  a^2 + b^2 < 1.\\nThus, for the triangle with sides (a,b,1) to be obtuse, it must be both a valid triangle and satisfy a^2 + b^2 < 1. (If 1 were not the longest side, we would have to consider other obtuse possibilities, but on [0,1] the maximum length is 1, so the obtuse angle, if any, must be opposite side 1.)\\n\\nTherefore the desired region is:\\nR = { (a,b) ∈ [0,1]^2 : a + b > 1 and a^2 + b^2 < 1 }.\\nWe need the area of R, since the joint density is uniform.\\n\\nGeometric description: In the first quadrant, the unit circle a^2 + b^2 = 1 intersects the square [0,1]^2 as the quarter circle between (1,0) and (0,1). The line a + b = 1 passes through (1,0) and (0,1). The region a^2 + b^2 < 1 is the quarter disk of radius 1; the region a + b > 1 is the triangle above that line within the square.\\nThe set R is the portion of the quarter disk lying above the line a + b = 1 within the square. This region is symmetric with respect to the line a=b, and bounded by the arc of the circle from (1,0) to (0,1) and the chord segment from (1,0) to (0,1) along the line a + b = 1.\\n\\nIn the full circle of radius 1 centered at the origin, the points (1,0) and (0,1) subtend a central angle of 90° = π/2 radians (since they are perpendicular unit vectors). The corresponding circular segment (the area between the chord and arc) with that chord in the unit circle has area given by the standard formula for a circle segment of radius R=1 and central angle θ (in radians):\\nsegment area = (R^2/2)(θ − sin θ).\\nHere R=1, θ = π/2, so\\nsegment area = 1/2 (π/2 − sin(π/2)) = 1/2 (π/2 − 1) = (π/4) − 1/2.\\nBecause we are in the first quadrant and the arc from (1,0) to (0,1) is entirely in that quadrant, this circular segment lies entirely in the first quadrant; thus R coincides exactly with that segment.\\n\\nTherefore the probability is the area of R, i.e.\\nP = π/4 − 1/2.\\n\\nSo the answers are: Problem 1: 1. Problem 2: π/4 − 1/2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"pi/4-1/2\"\n}",
