  "reasoning_content": "{\"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We are explicitly told not to solve the donut cost, but instead to compute e = floor(550 / 12) - 43.\\nCompute 550 / 12: 12 * 45 = 540 and 12 * 46 = 552 > 550, so floor(550 / 12) = 45.\\nThus e = 45 - 43 = 2.\\nSo the requested value for Problem 1 is 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: We want primes p such that 5p = floor(n^2 / 5) for some positive integer n.\\nLet k = floor(n^2 / 5). We need k to be a multiple of 5 and equal to 5p with p prime.\\nSo floor(n^2 / 5) = 5p.\\nThis inequality means: 5p <= n^2/5 < 5p + 1.\\nMultiply by 5: 25p <= n^2 < 25p + 5.\\nSo n^2 is an integer square in the interval [25p, 25p + 4]. Since 25p = (5√p)^2 (not necessarily an integer square unless p is a square, which it is not), we instead consider possible n of the form 5m + r and look modulo 25.\\nCompute n^2 mod 25. Squares modulo 25 are:\\n0^2 = 0, 1^2 = 1, 2^2 = 4, 3^2 = 9, 4^2 = 16, 5^2 = 0, 6^2 = 11, 7^2 = 24, 8^2 = 14, 9^2 = 6, 10^2 = 0, 11^2 = 21, 12^2 = 19, 13^2 = 19, 14^2 = 21, 15^2 = 0, 16^2 = 6, 17^2 = 14, 18^2 = 24, 19^2 = 11, 20^2 = 0, 21^2 = 16, 22^2 = 9, 23^2 = 4, 24^2 = 1.\\nThus the set of quadratic residues mod 25 is {0,1,4,6,9,11,14,16,19,21,24}.\\nWe need n^2 to be in [25p, 25p+4]. Mod 25, this means n^2 ≡ 0,1,2,3,4 (mod 25). Only residues among these that are quadratic residues are {0,1,4}.\\nHence n^2 ≡ 0, 1, or 4 (mod 25).\\nNow express n^2 as 25p + d with d ∈ {0,1,2,3,4} and also d ∈ {0,1,4}.\\nSo d ∈ {0,1,4} and n^2 = 25p + d.\\nBut we must also have 25p <= n^2 < 25p + 5, i.e., d ∈ {0,1,2,3,4}. So possibilities are d = 0,1,4.\\nWe need n^2 to be an integer square, so test each case.\\nCase d = 0: n^2 = 25p ⇒ n = 5√p, which forces p to be a perfect square. Since p is prime, impossible.\\nCase d = 1: n^2 = 25p + 1 = (5^2)p + 1. Then n^2 ≡ 1 (mod 25). Squares congruent to 1 mod 25 correspond to n ≡ ±1, ±4, ±6, ±9, ±11, ±14, ±16, ±19, ±21, ±24 mod 25, but that only tells consistency, not p.\\nInstead, parameterize n = 5m ± 1: then n^2 = 25m^2 ± 10m + 1.\\nSet this equal to 25p + 1: 25m^2 ± 10m + 1 = 25p + 1 ⇒ 25m^2 ± 10m = 25p ⇒ divide by 5: 5m^2 ± 2m = 5p ⇒ p = m^2 ± (2/5)m.\\nFor p to be integer, (2/5)m must be integer, so m multiple of 5: m = 5k.\\nThen for n = 5m ± 1 = 25k ± 1.\\nFor n = 25k + 1: p = 5k^2 + 2k.\\nFor n = 25k - 1: p = 5k^2 - 2k.\\nWe need p prime.\\nSimilarly, case d = 4: n^2 = 25p + 4.\\nLet n = 5m ± 2 (since n^2 ≡ 4 (mod 25)). Then n^2 = 25m^2 ± 20m + 4.\\nSet equal: 25m^2 ± 20m + 4 = 25p + 4 ⇒ 25m^2 ± 20m = 25p ⇒ divide by 5: 5m^2 ± 4m = 5p ⇒ p = m^2 ± (4/5)m.\\nFor integer p, m must be multiple of 5: m = 5k.\\nThen n = 25k ± 2.\\nFor n = 25k + 2: p = 5k^2 + 4k.\\nFor n = 25k - 2: p = 5k^2 - 4k.\\nThus all solutions reduce to primes of the form\\np1 = 5k^2 + 2k,\\np2 = 5k^2 - 2k,\\np3 = 5k^2 + 4k,\\np4 = 5k^2 - 4k,\\nfor some positive integer k, with corresponding n = 25k ± 1 or 25k ± 2.\\nWe now search for primes p that can arise from these expressions.\\nSince 5p = floor(n^2 / 5) becomes large with n, but there are only two such primes as stated, we expect small k.\\nCompute for small k.\\nTake k = 1:\\n p1 = 5(1)^2 + 2(1) = 7 (prime), associated with n = 25(1)+1 = 26 or 25(1)-1 = 24.\\n Check n = 26: n^2 = 676, n^2/5 = 135.2, floor = 135. 135/5 = 27 ⇒ p would be 27, not 7.\\n So the mapping above was for p in terms of m; we must ensure consistency.\\nRe-do concretely to avoid confusion:\\nStart fresh: Look directly for n such that floor(n^2/5) is divisible by 5 and the quotient is prime.\\nLet 5p = floor(n^2/5).\\nCompute n^2 modulo 5: residues are 0,1,4; floor(n^2/5) is just (n^2 - r)/5 where r is remainder.\\nBut simpler: test n by residue mod 5.\\nLet n = 5k + r, r ∈ {0,1,2,3,4}.\\nCompute n^2 and floor(n^2/5):\\nr = 0: n = 5k, n^2 = 25k^2, n^2/5 = 5k^2, floor = 5k^2. Then 5p = 5k^2 ⇒ p = k^2. For p prime, k must be 1, giving p = 1 (not prime). So no solutions.\\nr = 1: n = 5k + 1, n^2 = 25k^2 + 10k + 1.\\n n^2/5 = 5k^2 + 2k + 1/5, floor = 5k^2 + 2k.\\n So 5p = 5k^2 + 2k ⇒ p = k^2 + (2/5)k; to be integer, k multiple of 5: k = 5t.\\n Then p = 25t^2 + 2t.\\n Now we must have p prime.\\nr = 2: n = 5k + 2, n^2 = 25k^2 + 20k + 4.\\n n^2/5 = 5k^2 + 4k + 4/5, floor = 5k^2 + 4k.\\n So 5p = 5k^2 + 4k ⇒ p = k^2 + (4/5)k; k multiple of 5: k = 5t.\\n Then p = 25t^2 + 4t.\\nr = 3: n = 5k + 3, n^2 = 25k^2 + 30k + 9.\\n n^2/5 = 5k^2 + 6k + 9/5, floor = 5k^2 + 6k + 1.\\n So 5p = 5k^2 + 6k + 1 ⇒ p = k^2 + (6/5)k + 1/5; for integer p, k must make (6k+1) divisible by 5.\\nBut also note that 5p must be multiple of 5, and floor(n^2/5) is always integer; the above algebra is fine.\\nWe want p an integer and prime.\\nCondition for integer p: 5p = 5k^2 + 6k + 1 ⇒ 5 divides (6k + 1). This gives k ≡ 4 (mod 5).\\nSimilarly for r = 4: n = 5k + 4, n^2 = 25k^2 + 40k + 16.\\n n^2/5 = 5k^2 + 8k + 16/5, floor = 5k^2 + 8k + 3.\\n So 5p = 5k^2 + 8k + 3 ⇒ p = k^2 + (8/5)k + 3/5; need 5 | (8k + 3).\\nHowever, this brute residue pathway is getting complicated. Instead, the simpler modular interval approach is more reliable, so return to it and enumerate directly.\\nWe have 25p <= n^2 < 25p + 5. Thus n ≈ 5√p.\\nFor each prime p, there is at most one integer n that can satisfy this (as n^2 is strictly increasing). So we can loop over primes and check whether integer square lies in that range.\\nPractically, n^2 in [25p, 25p+4]. Let s^2 be a square in this interval. That means s = floor(sqrt(25p+4)) must satisfy s^2 >= 25p.\\nThus algorithmically: For primes p, let s = floor(sqrt(25p+4)). Check if s^2 between 25p and 25p+4. If yes, then n = s works.\\nWe also need that floor(n^2/5) = 5p, but that follows from n^2 in that interval.\\nNow search small primes.\\nTry p = 2: 25p = 50, 25p+4 = 54. Squares: 7^2 = 49, 8^2 = 64. None in [50,54]. So no.\\np = 3: [75,79]. Squares: 8^2 = 64, 9^2 = 81. None.\\np = 5: [125,129]. Squares: 11^2 = 121, 12^2 = 144. None.\\np = 7: [175,179]. Squares near: 13^2=169, 14^2=196. None.\\np = 11: [275,279]. 16^2=256,17^2=289. None.\\np = 13: [325,329]. 18^2=324,19^2=361. None.\\np = 17: [425,429]. 20^2=400,21^2=441. None.\\np = 19: [475,479]. 21^2=441,22^2=484. None.\\np = 23: [575,579]. 24^2=576,25^2=625. 576 in interval.\\nSo n^2 = 576, n = 24 works.\\nCheck: floor(24^2/5) = floor(576/5) = floor(115.2) = 115 = 5 * 23 ⇒ p = 23 is valid.\\nNext prime p = 29: [725,729]. 26^2=676,27^2=729. 729 in interval.\\nCheck: 729 between 725 and 729 inclusive. So n^2 = 729, n = 27.\\nCompute floor(27^2/5) = floor(729/5) = floor(145.8) = 145 = 5*29 ⇒ p = 29 is valid.\\nNext prime p = 31: [775,779]. 27^2=729,28^2=784. None.\\np = 37: [925,929]. 30^2=900,31^2=961. None.\\np = 41: [1025,1029]. 32^2=1024,33^2=1089. None.\\np = 43: [1075,1079]. 32^2=1024,33^2=1089. None.\\np = 47: [1175,1179]. 34^2=1156,35^2=1225. None.\\nAs p grows, the gap between consecutive squares around sqrt(25p) is about 2sqrt(25p) ≈ 10√p, which quickly exceeds 4, so only very small range of p can work and we've already seen hits at 23 and 29. To be safe, test a few more primes:\\np = 53: [1325,1329]. 36^2=1296,37^2=1369. None.\\np = 59: [1475,1479]. 38^2=1444,39^2=1521. None.\\np = 61: [1525,1529]. 39^2=1521,40^2=1600. None.\\nClearly no further solutions; the only primes with a square in [25p,25p+4] are 23 and 29.\\nThus the two primes are 23 and 29; their sum is 52.\\n\\nSo the answers are: Problem 1: 2, Problem 2: 52.\", \"answer_1\": \"2\", \"answer_2\": \"52\"}",
