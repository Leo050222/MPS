From (3), s = 19 - x.\\nFrom (1) and (2):\\nxy + z = 40 => z = 40 - xy\\nxz + y = 51 => y = 51 - xz\\nThen s = y + z = (51 - xz) + (40 - xy) = 91 - x(y + z) = 91 - x s.\\nHence s satisfies: s = 91 - x s => s(1 + x) = 91 => s = 91/(1 + x), provided x ≠ -1.\\nBut s also equals 19 - x, so:\\n19 - x = 91/(1 + x).\\nMultiply both sides by (1 + x):\\n(19 - x)(1 + x) = 91\\n=> 19 + 19x - x - x^2 = 91\\n=> 19 + 18x - x^2 = 91\\n=> -x^2 + 18x - 72 = 0\\nMultiply by -1: x^2 - 18x + 72 = 0.\\nDiscriminant: Δ = 18^2 - 4·72 = 324 - 288 = 36, roots:\\nx = (18 ± 6)/2 => x = 12 or x = 6.\\nThen x + 1 roots are 13 and 7.

One competitor is chosen uniformly at random to be active initially; others are inactive. Each round: pick a random inactive competitor uniformly, they play the current active. The higher skill wins and becomes active; loser is eliminated. After 20 games, one player remains. Alice has skill 11. We want the expected number of games Alice plays.\\nKey observation: Whenever Alice is active and some other player is chosen to play her, Alice wins if the opponent’s skill < 11 and loses otherwise. When she’s inactive, she plays only when chosen to face the current active player. Her total games = number of times she is selected as an opponent (while inactive) plus the games she plays while active before being eliminated.\\nA powerful symmetry: The process is equivalent to the following: we take a random permutation (ordering) of the 21 players, and then we process them from left to right, maintaining the maximum skill seen so far as “leader/active”. This equivalence is standard: choosing a random initial active and then repeatedly drawing a random inactive opponent is distributionally the same, as a sequence of opponents, to revealing players in random order and keeping the highest-skill seen as champion.\\nUnder this equivalent view:\\n- The active player after each step is exactly the current maximum skill among those revealed so far.\\n- A player plays a game exactly once at the moment they arrive (are revealed) against the current active champion (the current maximum so far). After that game, either they become champion (if stronger) or are eliminated.\\nHowever, we must reconcile with the original process: in the original process, the initial active is chosen from all 21; in the permutation model, the first element in the permutation is the initial leader and plays no game at the moment of arrival. But in the original process, that initial active also hasn’t played a game before being chosen as active. After that, every newly selected inactive does indeed play one game. So under the permutation analogy:\\n- The first element in the permutation is the initial active and does not play immediately, matching the original.\\n- Each subsequent element in the permutation plays exactly one game when it is first picked.\\nThus, any competitor’s number of games equals:\\n- 0 if they are the first in the permutation and subsequently never become active before being eliminated (but in fact the first element is active at start; their first game occurs when someone else is drawn to play them. In the permutation model as usually described, each new competitor plays exactly one game, but the initial one’s first game occurs when someone else is revealed. To align precisely: each step of revealing a new competitor corresponds to one game between the current champion and the new competitor; the champion may have already played before. Under this mapping, the first revealed competitor becomes champion without playing a game at that moment. Then every time a new competitor is revealed, there is exactly one game and that new competitor plays in it.)\\nSo in this model, a player plays a game exactly when they appear in the permutation, except the very first one, who plays later when the second appears. For counting games per individual, it is easier to reason via symmetry of elimination events:\\nIn any single-elimination tournament where higher skill always wins, the total number of games every player plays equals (number of times they appear as loser) + (number of times they appear as winner). Each player except the ultimate champion loses exactly once if they ever enter a match; the champion never loses. The format here is sequential, but this property still holds: any player that is ever involved in the process and is not the final champion must lose exactly once, and the champion never loses. However, players are all involved (since the process runs until one remains), so each non-champion plays at least one game (the one in which they lose), plus any wins they might accumulate before that.\\nTo get the expected number of games for Alice, we can use linearity of expectation and consider:\\nExpected games for Alice = sum over all rounds r of P(Alice plays in round r).\\nBut a more direct approach uses a well-known fact in random leader/champion processes:\\nWhen players have distinct strengths and strong always beats weak, and you process players in a random order letting the best-so-far remain champion, the number of times any given player becomes champion equals 1 if they ever appear (if they are stronger than all previously revealed) and 0 otherwise. A player with rank k (1 = weakest, 21 = strongest) becomes champion exactly once if they appear before any higher-ranked (stronger) player appears. They then remain champion until a stronger player appears.\\nWe can map Alice with skill 11. There are 10 weaker (1–10) and 10 stronger (12–21).\\nIn the permutation process:\\n- Alice’s first game occurs when she appears among the sequence of players. At that step, she faces the current champion (the maximum among those who appeared before her). There are two cases: either the current champion is weaker than 11 or stronger than 11.\\nCase A: All players before Alice are weaker (<11). Then the current champion is some skill in {1,...,10}. Alice beats them and becomes champion. She stays champion until someone stronger than 11 appears (one of 12–21). Every arrival of weaker players after that will be beaten by her; every arrival of a stronger player will beat her and end her participation.\\nCase B: At least one stronger player (>11) appears before Alice. Then the current champion at her arrival is stronger than 11. She plays exactly one game (vs that champion), loses, and is eliminated, never playing again.\\nSo, Alice’s total number of games is:\\n- If there is at least one stronger player before her: exactly 1 game.\\n- If all stronger players appear after her: she becomes champion at her first appearance, then she plays one game against each subsequently arriving player until a stronger appears and defeats her, or she remains champion to the end if she is actually strongest among all, but she is not; there are stronger players.\\nLet’s formalize via position in a random permutation of the 21 players.\\nLet Alice’s rank among the 21 by skill be 11 (i.e., 10 weaker, 10 stronger). Suppose we have a uniform random permutation of the 21 labels. Let A be Alice’s position (1–21). Consider the subset of 11..21 containing Alice; but we’ll derive more systematically.\\nDefine:\\n- W: set of weaker players {1,...,10}, size 10.\\n- S: set of stronger players {12,...,21}, size 10.\\nWe look at the permutation restricted to Alice plus these 20 others.\\nLet A be Alice’s position index in the permutation; let X be the number of stronger players that appear before her; Y the number of weaker players that appear before her. Then X + Y = A - 1.\\nCase B is X ≥ 1. Then Alice loses upon first game and plays exactly 1 game.\\nCase A is X = 0, i.e., no stronger players before her; equivalently, all players before her are from W. That means she is the strongest so far and will become champion upon arrival (if not already champion via some other path, but in this model, each arrival triggers one game with current champion). After that, we must count how many additional games she plays.\\nFor the process after she becomes champion: For each subsequent player in the permutation after Alice’s position A, she plays a game if she is still champion; otherwise she is out. She remains champion while encountering weaker players and loses her championship (and is eliminated) when she first meets a stronger player.\\nThus, if there are R stronger players after her (R = 10 - X, and since X=0, R = 10), and there are also remaining weaker players after her: total weaker players: 10; Y appeared before her; so remaining weaker after her are 10 - Y.\\nAmong the players after her, we have R stronger (10) and (10 - Y) weaker. Their order is random. Alice, as champion, will face players in that order until the first stronger S appears; she wins against any weaker before that first stronger. If a stronger appears at position t among the subsequence of all after-A players, that means she wins t-1 games vs weaker players and loses the t-th game, totaling t games after becoming champion. She already played 1 game at her arrival, so total games = 1 + t.\\nBut the distribution of the position of the first stronger among the multiset of (10 stronger, 10-Y weaker) is a geometric-like truncated distribution. It is simpler to think:\\nGiven X = 0 (no stronger before Alice) and given Y (weaker before her), among the 10 stronger and 10 weaker, exactly Y weaker are before her; all 10 stronger are after her. After her, we have 10 stronger and (10 - Y) weaker. Order uniform. The position J of the first stronger among these players has distribution:\\nP(J > j) = probability that first j players after Alice are all weaker = [ (10 - Y)_j / (20 - (A))_j ], but since A = X + Y + 1 = Y + 1, the total remaining after Alice are 21 - A = 20 - Y. So we have 10 - Y weaker and 10 stronger among 20 - Y positions.\\nMore directly: the relative order of the 10 stronger among the 20 - Y remaining is uniform; the position of the earliest stronger is distributed like the minimum of 10 samples without replacement. But instead of tackling this conditionally, it’s easier to derive expected number of wins after becoming champion via symmetry.\\nNote: When X = 0, among all 10 stronger players, they all appear after Alice by definition. So Alice must eventually lose (since stronger exists) at her first encounter with any of these 10. Each weaker after her that appears before that first stronger is a win for her.\\nConsider the subsequence consisting only of Alice and the 10 stronger players. Among these 11, Alice’s relative position among stronger determines the count of stronger after her (which are 10 in this case since X=0) and thus when she meets them is irrelevant since all stronger are after. But her wins depend on the interleaving of weaker and stronger after her. A well-known trick: expected number of weaker arrivals that appear before the earliest stronger after Alice equals (number of weaker after her)/(number of stronger after her + 1). This is a standard result for randomly interleaving two types when considering the position of first stronger.\\nReason: If you randomly order R red (stronger) and B blue (weaker) items, the expected number of blues before the first red is B/(R+1). This follows from symmetry or from the fact that if you place R red separators into B+R+1 slots, etc.\\nHere, after Alice, we have R = 10 stronger, B = (10 - Y) weaker. So:\\nE[#weaker before first stronger | X=0, Y] = B/(R+1) = (10 - Y)/(10 + 1) = (10 - Y)/11.\\nTherefore, conditional on (X=0, Y), Alice’s games after becoming champion = 1 (the losing game vs first stronger) + number of weaker before that first stronger (wins). So:\\nE[games after Alice’s arrival | X=0, Y] = 1 + (10 - Y)/11.\\nShe also plays 1 game at her arrival (against champion among weaker before her). Total expected games given X=0, Y is:\\nE[Games | X=0, Y] = 1 (arrival) + [1 + (10 - Y)/11] = 2 + (10 - Y)/11.\\nNow we need to average over Y conditioned on X=0.\\nCondition X=0 means no stronger before Alice; equivalently, among the A-1 people before her, all are from W. But a simpler view: let’s consider the random permutation of the 11 individuals in {Alice} ∪ S (10 stronger). Since X=0 means Alice is the first among {Alice ∪ S} in the permutation of all 21 players. The probability that Alice is the first among these 11 is 1/11 because all 11 orderings among them are equally likely. Conditional on X=0, Alice’s position among the 11 is 1. Now her absolute position A can be 1..11. Actually, being first among these 11 means none of the 10 stronger are before her, but there can be weaker before her. The number of weaker before her Y is a random variable:\\nAmong W (10 weaker), each equally likely to be before or after her relative to the full permutation positions, subject to X=0. However, given that none of the stronger are before Alice, the relative ordering of Alice and the 10 weaker among themselves is uniform over permutations where Alice is among these 11 but unconstrained relative to weaker. Equivalently, among the 11 positions taken by Alice and the 10 stronger plus some subset of weaker, we can reason more simply:\\nA cleaner combinatorial approach: Look at the permutation of the 11 items consisting of Alice plus the 10 stronger; ignore weaker. X=0 means Alice is the first among these 11 in the full permutation; but we don’t care about the positions of weaker, which can interleave arbitrarily. The key is: the count Y (weaker before Alice) is independent of the event that she is first among the 11? Not exactly independent, but symmetry shows it is uniformly distributed from 0 to 10:\\nConsider the 21 positions; choose position for Alice, choose positions for the 10 stronger, then fill with 10 weaker. Event X=0 = “Alice is earlier than all 10 stronger” => among the 11 positions that will eventually be occupied by Alice + stronger, Alice occupies the earliest. The 10 weaker will occupy the remaining 10 positions, but their counts before Alice depend only on where Alice is placed.\\nAlternatively, we can compute P(Y = y | X=0).\\nFor Y = y, we need:\\n- Exactly y weaker before Alice.\\n- Alice is earlier than all 10 stronger.\\nCount permutations satisfying (X=0, Y=y) and divide by count with X=0.\\nTotal permutations of 21 players: 21!.\\nCount with X=0 (Alice earlier than all 10 stronger, but weaker arbitrary): Among the 11 positions that eventually hold {Alice ∪ S}, Alice must be the earliest. Among these 11 players, each is equally likely to be earliest; probability that Alice is earliest is 1/11. So:\\n#(X=0) = (1/11) * 21!.\\nNow compute #(X=0, Y=y):\\nChoose y positions for weaker before Alice, then 1 position for Alice, then positions for 10 stronger and remaining 10 - y weaker. But enumeration might get messy. Instead, note by symmetry: Given that Alice is earliest among {Alice ∪ S}, the positions of Alice and these 10 stronger among the 21 are like picking 11 distinct positions uniformly at random and then picking the earliest among them to be Alice. Conditioned on this, the position of Alice among the 21 is distributed like the minimum of 11 i.i.d. discrete positions, but we just need distribution of number of weaker before that position.\\nWe can equivalently think: choose positions for all 21 labels uniformly at random. Condition on event E = “Alice earlier than all 10 stronger”. Now consider weaker. The 10 weaker occupy the remaining 20 positions aside from Alice’s; relative to Alice, each weaker is independently equally likely to be before or after Alice? With conditioning on E, there might be a slight dependence, but due to the independence of ordering between W and {Alice ∪ S}, the positions of W relative to Alice are independent of event E. Formally, the orderings of W and of {Alice ∪ S} are independent; event E depends only on relative order within {Alice ∪ S}, so it is independent of positions of W. Therefore Y is independent of E.\\nThus, Y’s distribution is the same as without conditioning: for each weaker, probability it is before Alice is 1/2, independently, so Y ~ Binomial(10, 1/2).\\nSo conditioned on X=0, Y ~ Bin(10, 1/2).\\nTherefore:\\nE[Games | X=0] = E_Y[2 + (10 - Y)/11] = 2 + (1/11)E[10 - Y] = 2 + (1/11)(10 - E[Y]).\\nE[Y] = 10 * (1/2) = 5, so 10 - E[Y] = 5. Then:\\nE[Games | X=0] = 2 + (1/11)*5 = 2 + 5/11 = (22/11) + (5/11) = 27/11.\\nNow compute P(X=0). Among Alice plus the 10 stronger, each of the 11 is equally likely to be earliest in the permutation, so P(Alice earliest among them) = 1/11. So P(X=0) = 1/11.\\nIn complement case X ≥ 1, as argued, Alice plays exactly 1 game (she loses to the first stronger champion she meets). So E[Games | X ≥ 1] = 1.\\nThus total expectation:\\nE[Games] = P(X=0)*E[Games | X=0] + P(X≥1)*E[Games | X≥1]\\n= (1/11)*(27/11) + (10/11)*1.\\nCompute:\\n(1/11)*(27/11) = 27/121.\\n(10/11)*1 = 10/11 = 110/121.\\nSum = (27 + 110)/121 = 137/121.\\nSo the expected number of games Alice plays is 137/121.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: 11\\nProblem 2: 137/121\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"137/121\"\n}",
