Since a, b are positive integers, k is an integer.\\nWe have\\nb^k / a^k = 27/8 = (3^3)/(2^3) = (3/2)^3.\\nThus (b/a)^k = (3/2)^3.\\nWe must have b/a a positive rational whose power is (3/2)^3.\\nConsider integer solutions (since a, b are positive integers). Write b = a * (3/2)^(3/k). For b to be integer, a must absorb denominators.\\nTry simple integer k values dividing 3, because exponents with rational base and integer exponent yield powers.\\nIf k = 3, then (b/a)^3 = (3/2)^3 so b/a = 3/2.\\nThus b = (3/2) a. For integers, let a = 2t, so b = 3t, with t positive integer.\\nNow check the equation directly with a = 2t, b = 3t:\\nLHS: 8 a^a b^b = 8 (2t)^{2t} (3t)^{3t}.\\nRHS: 27 a^b b^a = 27 (2t)^{3t} (3t)^{2t}.\\nDivide LHS by RHS:\\n[8 (2t)^{2t} (3t)^{3t}] / [27 (2t)^{3t} (3t)^{2t}] = (8/27) * (2t)^{2t-3t} * (3t)^{3t-2t}\\n= (8/27) * (2t)^{-t} * (3t)^t\\n= (8/27) * (3^t t^t)/(2^t t^t)\\n= (8/27) * (3^t / 2^t) = (8/27) * (3/2)^t.\\nTo have equality, this ratio must be 1, so\\n(8/27) * (3/2)^t = 1 => (3/2)^t = 27/8 = (3/2)^3,\\nso t = 3.\\nThen a = 2t = 6 and b = 3t = 9.\\nWe should also check that no other integer k works.\\nFrom (b/a)^k = (3/2)^3, consider the base b/a. If k = 1, then b/a = (3/2)^3 = 27/8, which gives a multiple of 8 and b = 27k, but plugging into the original equation would reintroduce the same type of consistency condition and would not simplify to an integer exponent relation aligning both sides (alternatively, note that then a and b would have large common factors, and substituting shows mismatch of prime powers; a quick attempt with a = 8, b = 27 fails).\\nIf k = -1, then (b/a)^(-1) = (3/2)^3, so a/b = (3/2)^3, which similarly yields rational not matching integer prime exponents in the original equation.\\nMore systematically, from 8 b^k = 27 a^k:\\n8 * 2^{v2(b^k)} * 3^{v3(b^k)} ... = 27 * 2^{v2(a^k)} * 3^{v3(a^k)} ...\\nMatching 2-adic and 3-adic valuations forces k positive and divisible by 3 in a way that leads back to the k = 3 family; the construction above gives the only positive integer pair: a = 6, b = 9.\\nTherefore a^2 + b^2 = 6^2 + 9^2 = 36 + 81 = 117.\\nSo answer_2 = 117.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"117\"\n}",
