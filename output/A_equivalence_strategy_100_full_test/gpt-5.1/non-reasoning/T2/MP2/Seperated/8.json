On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order.

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nLet z be a complex number with modulus r = |z| and argument θ. The houses Saturday: z, z^3, z^5, ..., z^{2013} (odd exponents from 1 to 2013). Sunday: starting at 1, then z^2, z^4, ..., z^{2012} (even exponents from 2 to 2012). Eli walks straight-line segments between consecutive points.\\n\\nDistance between two points a and b in the complex plane is |b - a|. We need total path length both days, equal by condition: total Saturday length = total Sunday length. We're told also that distance from starting point to last house (just the segment from start to last point) is sqrt(2012) on both days:\\n- Saturday: |z^{2013} - z| = sqrt(2012)\\n- Sunday: |z^{2012} - 1| = sqrt(2012)\\nWe are instructed not to find Re(z^2) directly but instead to find k = |z| - 1, where |z| is derived from equality of total path lengths.\\n\\nFirst, write total Saturday path length:\\nPoints: z^{1}, z^{3}, ..., z^{2013}. Consecutive exponents differ by 2, so segments are z^{2n-1} to z^{2n+1}. For convenience, index n from 0 to 1005:\\nSegment n goes from z^{2n+1} to z^{2n+3}. But easier: write general segment from z^{m} to z^{m+2}. For a fixed m,\\n|z^{m+2} - z^m| = |z^m||z^2 - 1| = r^{m} |z^2 - 1|, since |z^m| = r^m.\\nSaturday exponents m run 1,3,5,...,2011 (since from 1 to 2013 with step 2, there are 1006 odd exponents, hence 1005 segments; segment j runs from exponent 2j+1 to 2j+3, effectively m = 2j+1 from 1 to 2011). Thus total Saturday length:\\nL_S = Σ_{j=0}^{1004} |z^{2j+3} - z^{2j+1}| = |z^2 - 1| Σ_{j=0}^{1004} r^{2j+1}.\\nSo L_S = |z^2 - 1| * r * (1 + r^2 + r^4 + ... + r^{2*1004}). There are 1005 terms of r^{2j} from j=0 to 1004, highest exponent 2*1004 = 2008. This is a geometric series:\\nΣ_{j=0}^{1004} r^{2j} = (r^{2*1005} - 1)/(r^2 - 1) = (r^{2010} - 1)/(r^2 - 1), provided r^2 ≠ 1. Hence\\nL_S = |z^2 - 1| * r * (r^{2010} - 1)/(r^2 - 1).\\n\\nSunday: start at 1, then z^2, z^4, ..., z^{2012}. First segment: 1 to z^2, length |z^2 - 1|. Consecutive segments: z^{2n} to z^{2n+2}, distance |z^{2n+2} - z^{2n}| = r^{2n}|z^2 - 1|.\\nTotal Sunday length L_U:\\nL_U = |z^2 - 1| [1 + Σ_{n=1}^{1005} r^{2n}]. The exponents: n from 1 to 1005 for segments between z^{2n} and z^{2n+2}; there are 1005 such segments, plus the initial 1→z^2 segment.\\nSo L_U = |z^2 - 1| [1 + r^2 + r^4 + ... + r^{2*1005}], a series from r^0 to r^{2010} inclusive, 1006 terms. Thus\\nL_U = |z^2 - 1| * (r^{2*1006} - 1)/(r^2 - 1), where 2*1006 = 2012. So\\nL_U = |z^2 - 1| * (r^{2012} - 1)/(r^2 - 1).\\n\\nWe are told the total path length both days is equal: L_S = L_U.\\nCancel common factors: Since |z^2 - 1| ≥ 0, and nonzero unless z^2 = 1. If z^2 = 1, then z = ±1, but that will conflict with the start-to-end distance sqrt(2012) (since |z^{2013} - z| = |z - z| = 0 or |(-1)^{2013} - (-1)| = 0, not sqrt(2012)), so |z^2 - 1| > 0 and we may divide by it. Also for r^2 = 1 (r=1), we will see if that yields a contradiction.\\nSet\\nr * (r^{2010} - 1)/(r^2 - 1) = (r^{2012} - 1)/(r^2 - 1).\\nMultiply by (r^2 - 1):\\nr(r^{2010} - 1) = r^{2012} - 1.\\nLeft side: r^{2011} - r, right side r^{2012} - 1. So we get\\nr^{2011} - r = r^{2012} - 1.\\nRearrange:\\n0 = r^{2012} - 1 - (r^{2011} - r) = r^{2012} - 1 - r^{2011} + r.\\nFactor r^{2011} from first two terms: r^{2011}(r - 1) + (r - 1) = (r - 1)(r^{2011} + 1) = 0.\\nSo either r = 1 or r^{2011} = -1.\\nBut r = |z| ≥ 0 is real. r^{2011} = -1 has no nonnegative real solution, so discard. Thus r = 1.\\nCheck whether r=1 is allowed with the individual start-to-last distances: Recall we also know\\n|z^{2013} - z| = sqrt(2012) and |z^{2012} - 1| = sqrt(2012).\\nWith r = 1, |z^{2013} - z| = |z(z^{2012} - 1)| = |z||z^{2012} - 1| = |z^{2012} - 1|. So indeed both distances are equal automatically; consistency requires |z^{2012} - 1| = sqrt(2012). That gives a condition on the argument θ, but we are only asked for k = r - 1. Since r = 1, k = 0.\\nSo Problem 1 answer: k = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe need six-digit strings d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6, each digit in {1,2,...,9}, with the property that for each k = 2,...,6, the k-digit prefix (d1...dk) is divisible by k. Also implicitly:\\n- The 2-digit number d1d2 is divisible by 2.\\n- 3-digit number d1d2d3 is divisible by 3.\\n- 4-digit prefix divisible by 4.\\n- 5-digit prefix divisible by 5.\\n- 6-digit number divisible by 6 (meaning divisible by 2 and 3).\\nDigit 0 is not allowed; every digit is 1-9.\\nWe will count all such sequences.\\n\\nUse divisibility rules:\\n- Divisible by 2: last digit even.\\n- Divisible by 4: last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\\n- Divisible by 5: last digit must be 0 or 5, but 0 not allowed, so last digit is 5.\\n- Divisible by 3 (and 6): sum of digits divisible by 3; divisible by 6 means even and divisible by 3.\\n\\nFirst condition: 2-digit prefix N2 = 10 d1 + d2 divisible by 2. That just requires d2 even. So d2 in {2,4,6,8}. d1 can be 1-9.\\nNext, 3-digit prefix N3 divisible by 3, so (d1 + d2 + d3) ≡ 0 (mod 3).\\nNext, 4-digit prefix N4 divisible by 4; that means the last two digits d3d4 form a 2-digit number divisible by 4.\\nNext, 5-digit prefix N5 divisible by 5, so d5 = 5.\\nFinally, 6-digit number N6 divisible by 6: divisible by 2 and 3. Divisible by 2 → d6 even. Divisible by 3 → sum of all digits divisible by 3.\\nAdditionally, because 5-digit prefix is divisible by 5, N5 = d1...d5 must end with 5, but no requirement on divisibility by 2 or 3 etc at that length beyond 5.\\n\\nHowever, note that divisibility by 2 for N6 and divisibility by 2 for N2 involve different last digits (d2 vs d6), so they’re independent constraints.\\n\\nWe systematically construct solutions.\\nWe choose digits step by step with prefix constraints:\\n1) d1: any 1-9.\\n2) d2 must be even: {2,4,6,8}.\\n3) d3: must satisfy (d1 + d2 + d3) ≡ 0 mod 3.\\n4) d3 and d4 must make a 2-digit number divisible by 4.\\n5) d5 = 5.\\n6) d6 must be even and make entire 6-digit sum divisible by 3.\\n\\nBetter approach: iterate over possible pairs (d3,d4) that form a multiple of 4 with both digits 1-9. Then handle mod 3 constraints.\\n\\nEnumerate 2-digit multiples of 4 from 11 to 99 with digits 1-9 (no zeros). The multiples of 4 from 12 to 96:\\n12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40,44,48,52,56,60,64,68,72,76,80,84,88,92,96.\\nRemove those with 0: 20,40,60,80 removed. Keep:\\n12,16,24,28,32,36,44,48,52,56,64,68,72,76,84,88,92,96.\\nSo valid (d3,d4) pairs (in order d3,d4):\\n(1,2),(1,6),(2,4),(2,8),(3,2),(3,6),(4,4),(4,8),(5,2),(5,6),(6,4),(6,8),(7,2),(7,6),(8,4),(8,8),(9,2),(9,6).\\n\\nNow apply divisibility by 3 for 3-digit prefix: d1 + d2 + d3 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\nLet S3 = d1 + d2 + d3. For any fixed (d2,d3), this is a linear condition on d1 mod 3.\\nThen for 6-digit number divisibility by 3: sum S6 = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\nWe already have S3 ≡ 0, so S3 ≡ 0 ⇒ d1 + d2 + d3 ≡ 0. Let T = d4 + d5 + d6.\\nThen S6 ≡ S3 + T ≡ 0 + T ≡ 0 ⇒ T ≡ 0 mod 3.\\nGiven d5=5, T = d4 + 5 + d6. Condition: d4 + 5 + d6 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\nAnd also d6 must be even.\\n\\nSo the 6-digit divisibility by 3 depends only on d4 and d6, independent of d1,d2,d3 beyond the S3 condition.\\nWe can break counting into two independent parts:\\n- For each d2 and d3, count allowed d1 from S3.\\n- For each d4, count allowed d6 from T ≡ 0 mod 3 and even.\\nThen multiply counts appropriately across matching pairs (d3,d4) and sums over all valid pairs and d2.\\n\\nMore systematically:\\nGiven d2 (even) and d3 (from the list of valid pairs with d4), we must count d1 in {1..9} such that d1 + d2 + d3 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\nGiven an integer a = d2 + d3 mod 3, we need d1 ≡ -a (mod 3).\\nAmong digits 1..9, each residue class mod 3 appears exactly 3 times. So for any given target residue r mod 3, there are exactly 3 valid values of d1.\\nTherefore for each fixed (d2,d3), there are exactly 3 choices for d1.\\nSo we don't have to check further; for each combination d2 and d3, we get 3 d1.\\nHence our count = Σ over d2 (even digit 2,4,6,8), Σ over valid pairs (d3,d4) of [3 * (#choices for d6 given d4)]. Because d1 depends only on (d2,d3) but not on d4,d6, while d6 depends on d4 only; actually d2 enters only into S3, not into T. But note d3,d4 pairs are fixed from the multiples-of-4 list; d2 is independent of that.\\nThus we can treat d2 separately: for each d2 there are the same number of possibilities, because S3 condition always yields 3 d1 options for each d3, independent of residue of d2 (since mapping from residues is bijective). More concretely, for any fixed d2 and d3, there are 3 choices for d1. Therefore factor 4 (choices of d2) * 3 (choices of d1 per (d2,d3)) in front; d3 and d4 interactions only with mod 4 and mod 3 via d4.\\nNumber of sequences = 4 * Σ over all valid (d3,d4) [3 * (#options for d6 for that d4)]. Factor 3 out as well.\\nTotal = 4 * 3 * Σ_{valid (d3,d4)} (#options for d6 given d4) = 12 * Σ_{valid (d3,d4)} f(d4), where f(d4) is number of d6 that are even and satisfy d4 + 5 + d6 ≡ 0 mod 3.\\nBut f depends only on d4, not on d3. So group by d4.\\n\\nCompute f(d4):\\nCondition: d4 + 5 + d6 ≡ 0 (mod 3). Write d6 even in {2,4,6,8}. So we list d6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}, check mod 3.\\nCompute d6 mod 3:\\n2 ≡ 2\\n4 ≡ 1\\n6 ≡ 0\\n8 ≡ 2\\nSo residues {2,1,0,2}.\\nFor each d4, compute (d4 + 5) mod 3, then find d6 so that d6 ≡ - (d4 + 5) mod 3.\\n\\nFirst, list d4 values from the valid pair list, with counts of how many pairs use each d4.\\nFrom the list of pairs (d3,d4):\\n(1,2),(1,6),\\n(2,4),(2,8),\\n(3,2),(3,6),\\n(4,4),(4,8),\\n(5,2),(5,6),\\n(6,4),(6,8),\\n(7,2),(7,6),\\n(8,4),(8,8),\\n(9,2),(9,6).\\nCheck distribution by d4:\\n- d4=2 appears with d3 = 1,3,5,7,9 (pairs (1,2),(3,2),(5,2),(7,2),(9,2)), so 5 times.\\n- d4=6 appears with d3 = 1,3,5,7,9 (pairs (1,6),(3,6),(5,6),(7,6),(9,6)), so 5 times.\\n- d4=4 appears with d3 = 2,4,6,8 (pairs (2,4),(4,4),(6,4),(8,4)), so 4 times.\\n- d4=8 appears with d3 = 2,4,6,8 (pairs (2,8),(4,8),(6,8),(8,8)), so 4 times.\\nTotal pairs = 5+5+4+4 = 18, matching our enumeration.\\n\\nNow compute f(d4).\\nCompute (d4 + 5) mod 3:\\n- d4=2: 2+5=7 ≡ 1 mod 3.\\nNeed d6 ≡ -1 ≡ 2 mod 3.\\nAmong {2,4,6,8}, residues {2,1,0,2}. Those ≡2: d6=2,8. So f(2)=2.\\n\\n- d4=6: 6+5=11 ≡ 2 mod 3.\\nNeed d6 ≡ -2 ≡ 1 mod 3.\\nAmong {2,4,6,8}, ≡1 is 4 only. So f(6)=1.\\n\\n- d4=4: 4+5=9 ≡ 0.\\nNeed d6 ≡ 0.\\nAmong {2,4,6,8}, ≡0 is 6 only. So f(4)=1.\\n\\n- d4=8: 8+5=13 ≡ 1.\\nNeed d6 ≡ 2.\\nSo d6=2 or 8. Thus f(8)=2.\\n\\nNow sum over all 18 pairs (d3,d4): Σ_{pairs} f(d4) = Σ over d4 of [count(d4) * f(d4)].\\nUsing counts:\\ncount(2)=5, count(6)=5, count(4)=4, count(8)=4.\\nSo sum = 5*f(2) + 5*f(6) + 4*f(4) + 4*f(8) = 5*2 + 5*1 + 4*1 + 4*2.\\nCompute: 5*2=10, 5*1=5, 4*1=4, 4*2=8; total 10+5+4+8 = 27.\\nThen total sequences = 12 * 27 = 324.\\n\\nCheck sample given ID 123252:\\nDigits: d1=1,d2=2,d3=3,d4=2,d5=5,d6=2.\\n- 2-digit 12 divisible by 2 ✔\\n- 3-digit 123 divisible by 3 ✔\\n- 4-digit 1232: last two digits 32 divisible by 4 ✔\\n- 5-digit 12325 ends with 5, divisible by 5 ✔\\n- 6-digit 123252: even and sum digits 1+2+3+2+5+2=15 divisible by 3, so divisible by 6 ✔.\\nDoes it satisfy our mod-3 relationships? For d4=2, f(2)=2, we allowed d6=2 or 8. Here d6=2, good. d3=3, check d1 condition: d1 + d2 + d3 = 1+2+3=6 ≡0, fine. So it is in our count.\\nThus Problem 2 answer: 324.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"324\"\n}",
