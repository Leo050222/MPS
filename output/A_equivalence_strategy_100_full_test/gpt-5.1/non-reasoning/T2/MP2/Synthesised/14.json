  "math_problem": "Victoria wants to order at least 550 donuts from Dunkin' Donuts for the HMMT 2014 November contest. However, donuts only come in multiples of twelve. Assuming every twelve donuts cost $7.49, what is the minimum amount Victoria needs to pay, in dollars? Instead of computing the minimum cost to acquire at least the required number of units when purchases are constrained to multiples of the base quantity, simply find $e = \\left\\lfloor 550 / 12 \\right\\rfloor - 43$. There are two prime numbers $p$ so that $5 p$ can be expressed in the form $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n^{e}}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ for some positive integer $n$. What is the sum of these two prime numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First compute e = floor(550 / 12) - 43. Since 12 * 45 = 540 and 12 * 46 = 552 > 550, floor(550 / 12) = 45, so e = 45 - 43 = 2. We need primes p such that 5p = floor(n^2 / 5) for some positive integer n. Let k = 5p, so k is a multiple of 5 and prime times 5. The condition floor(n^2 / 5) = k means k ≤ n^2 / 5 < k + 1, or 5k ≤ n^2 < 5k + 5. The interval [5k, 5k+5) has length 5, so we need it to contain a perfect square. Let n^2 = m. Then m is in {5k, 5k+1, 5k+2, 5k+3, 5k+4}. Squares modulo 5 are only 0,1,4. We test cases:\\n- If n^2 = 5k, then k must be a perfect square, but k = 5p with p prime cannot be a square: 5 and p would both have odd exponents in the factorization.\\n- If n^2 = 5k + 1, then 5p = k = (n^2 - 1)/5 = (n - 1)(n + 1)/5. Since p is prime, (n - 1)(n + 1) must equal 25p. Write a = n - 1, b = n + 1, so b - a = 2, ab = 25p. Then a and b are positive integers, same parity, differ by 2. Put a = x, b = x + 2, then x(x + 2) = 25p, so x^2 + 2x - 25p = 0 with discriminant D = 4 + 100p = 4(1 + 25p). For integer x, 1 + 25p must be a perfect square, say t^2. Then t^2 - 25p = 1, or (t - 5sqrt(p))(t + 5sqrt(p)) = 1, but more directly treat (t, p) in integers: t^2 - 25p = 1, so t^2 ≡ 1 (mod 25); however, also p = (t^2 - 1)/25. Try small t such that (t^2 - 1) is divisible by 25 and gives p prime. Squares modulo 25 are 0,1,4,6,9,11,14,16,19,21,24. Values t with t^2 ≡ 1 (mod 25) are t ≡ ±1, ±4, ±6, ±9 (mod 25). Check t values: t = 1 gives p=0, invalid; t = 4 gives p=(16-1)/25=15/25 not integer; t = 6 gives 35/25 not integer; t = 9 gives 80/25 not integer; t = 11 gives p=(121-1)/25=120/25=24 not prime; t = 14 gives 195/25 not integer; t = 16 gives 255/25 not integer; t = 19 gives p=(361-1)/25=360/25=14.4 not integer; t = 21 gives 440/25 not integer; t = 24 gives 575/25=23, which is prime. For t=24, p=23, then k=5p=115. Now check n: 1 + 25p = t^2 gives 1 + 25*23 = 576 = 24^2, and x = (-2 ± sqrt(D))/2 = (-2 ± 48)/2, so x=23 or x=-25, take x=23, then a=23, b=25, n = (a + b)/2 = 24. Verify floor(n^2/5) = floor(576/5) = floor(115.2) = 115 = 5*23, so p=23 is one solution.\\n- If n^2 = 5k + 4, then similarly 5p = k = (n^2 - 4)/5 = (n - 2)(n + 2)/5. Let a = n - 2, b = n + 2, so b - a = 4 and ab = 25p. With a = x, b = x + 4: x(x+4) = 25p, x^2 + 4x - 25p = 0, discriminant D = 16 + 100p = 4(4 + 25p). For integer x, 4 + 25p must be a perfect square s^2, and p = (s^2 - 4)/25. Set s^2 - 4 ≡ 0 (mod 25) or s^2 ≡ 4 (mod 25). Squares ≡ 4 (mod 25) occur for s ≡ ±2, ±3, ±7, ±8, ±12 (mod 25). Try small s giving p integer and prime: s=2 gives p=0; s=3 gives 5/25 not integer; s=7 gives (49-4)/25=45/25 not integer; s=8 gives (64-4)/25=60/25=12 not prime; s=12 gives (144-4)/25=140/25=5.6 not integer; test larger: s=13 gives (169-4)/25=165/25 not integer; s=17 gives (289-4)/25=285/25=11.4 not integer; s=18 gives (324-4)/25=320/25=12.8; s=22 gives (484-4)/25=480/25=19.2; s=23 gives (529-4)/25=525/25=21; s=27 gives 725/25=29, which is prime. So p=29 works. Then k=5p=145. Find n: 4 + 25p = s^2 gives 4 + 25*29 = 4 + 725 = 729 = 27^2, D=4*729=2916, sqrt(D)=54, x = (-4 ± 54)/2 gives x=25 or x=-29, take x=25, so a=25, b=29, n=(a+b)/2=27. Check floor(n^2/5) = floor(729/5) = floor(145.8) = 145 = 5*29, so p=29 is another solution.\\nThe remaining case n^2 = 5k + 2 or 5k + 3 modulo 5 is impossible since squares are not congruent to 2 or 3 mod 5. Thus the only primes p that work are 23 and 29, and their sum is 52.\",\n    \"answer\": \"52\"\n}",
