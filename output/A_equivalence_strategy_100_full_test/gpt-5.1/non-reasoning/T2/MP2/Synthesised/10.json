  "math_problem": "$a$ and $b$ are integers such that $a+\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{15+\\sqrt{216}}$. Compute $a / b$. Instead of computing the ratio of the integer coefficient to the radicand in the denested form of the nested radical, simply find $k = a + 3$, where $a$ is the integer coefficient in that denested form. Mark has a cursed $k$-sided die that never rolls the same number twice in a row, and all other outcomes are equally likely. Compute the expected number of rolls it takes for Mark to roll every number at least once.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n  \"reasoning\": \"First denest the radical. Let a and b be integers with a + sqrt(b) = sqrt(15 + sqrt(216)). Square both sides: a^2 + 2a sqrt(b) + b = 15 + sqrt(216). Matching rational and irrational parts gives a^2 + b = 15 and 2a sqrt(b) = sqrt(216) = 6 sqrt(6). Hence 2a sqrt(b) = 6 sqrt(6) => a sqrt(b) = 3 sqrt(6). Since a and b are integers, take b = 6 and a = 3. Then k = a + 3 = 6.\\n\\nNow consider Mark’s cursed k-sided die with k = 6. It never rolls the same number twice in a row; among the remaining k-1 faces, each is equally likely. We want the expected number of rolls to see all 6 faces at least once.\\n\\nModel the process by the number of distinct faces seen so far, m (1 ≤ m ≤ 6). The first roll is arbitrary and gives m = 1, so count that roll separately and then compute the additional expected rolls. Suppose after some roll we have seen m distinct faces, and the last face rolled is one of those m. On the next roll, the die can show any of the other k-1 faces uniformly. Among those k-1 faces, exactly (m-1) are already seen (the previously seen faces except the last one), and (k - m) are new faces. Thus, the probability that the next roll shows a new face is\\n\\np_m = (k - m)/(k - 1).\\n\\nLet E_m be the expected additional rolls needed to go from having seen m faces to having seen all k faces (still counting rolls after a state with m distinct faces, and where the current last roll is among those m faces). Each roll is an independent step within this Markov chain, with probability p_m of increasing m by 1 and probability 1 - p_m of staying at m. The expected number of steps to move from m to m+1 is geometric with mean 1/p_m. Hence\\n\\nE_m = sum_{i=m}^{k-1} 1/p_i,\\n\\nand the total expected rolls from the start is 1 (for the first roll) plus the expected additional rolls to go from m = 1 to m = k:\\n\\nE_total = 1 + sum_{m=1}^{k-1} 1/p_m,\\n\\nwith p_m = (k - m)/(k - 1).\\n\\nCompute 1/p_m: 1/p_m = (k - 1)/(k - m). Let t = k - m. As m runs from 1 to k - 1, t runs from k - 1 down to 1. Thus,\\n\\nsum_{m=1}^{k-1} 1/p_m = sum_{t=1}^{k-1} (k - 1)/t = (k - 1) * H_{k-1},\\n\\nwhere H_n is the nth harmonic number. Therefore\\n\\nE_total = 1 + (k - 1) H_{k-1}.\\n\\nFor k = 6:\\n\\nH_5 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 = 137/60.\\n\\nThen (k - 1) H_{k-1} = 5 * 137/60 = 685/60.\\n\\nSo E_total = 1 + 685/60 = 745/60. Simplify the fraction: gcd(745, 60) = 5, so\\n\\nE_total = (745/5) / (60/5) = 149/12.\\n\\nThus the exact expected number of rolls is 149/12.\",\n  \"answer\": \"149/12\"\n}",
