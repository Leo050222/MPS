  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We want positive integers n such that (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) is a positive integer.\\n\\n1) Simplify the expression by polynomial division:\\n   n^3 + 3 = n(n^2 + 7) - 7n + 3\\n   So (n^3 + 3)/(n^2 + 7) = n + (-7n + 3)/(n^2 + 7)\\n   Let the integer value be T. Then T = n + r, where r = (-7n + 3)/(n^2 + 7).\\n   For T to be an integer, r must be an integer, so n^2 + 7 divides -7n + 3.\\n\\n2) Let d = n^2 + 7. Then d | (-7n + 3). Since d also divides n^2 + 7, it divides any integer combination:\\n   -7(n^2 + 7) + n(-7n + 3) = -14n - 49\\n   So d | (-14n - 49).\\n   Also, d | (-7n + 3). Then d divides any integer combination of these; eliminate n:\\n\\n   From -7n + 3 = A*d, we have 7n = 3 - A*d, so n is expressed in terms of A, but a more efficient approach is to use inequalities: \\n   | -7n + 3 | ≥ 0 but must be at least d if the quotient’s magnitude is ≥ 1.\\n\\n   However, we know d = n^2 + 7 > 0 and | -7n + 3 | >= 0. If | -7n + 3 | < d, then the only way for d to divide -7n + 3 is for -7n + 3 = 0.\\n   For n ≥ 3: n^2 + 7 >= 16 and | -7n + 3 | = 7n - 3. For n ≥ 3, 7n - 3 < n^2 + 7 (e.g., check n=3: 7*3-3=18, 3^2+7=16, so inequality might reverse near small n; better check small n directly).\\n\\n3) Check small n explicitly:\\n   n=1: (1^3+3)/(1^2+7) = 4/8 = 1/2, not integer.\\n   n=2: (8+3)/(4+7) = 11/11 = 1, integer.\\n   n=3: (27+3)/(9+7) = 30/16 = 15/8, not integer.\\n   n=4: (64+3)/(16+7) = 67/23, not integer.\\n   n=5: (125+3)/(25+7)=128/32=4, integer.\\n   n=6: (216+3)/(36+7)=219/43 not integer.\\n\\n   Try to see if any larger n can work. Consider | -7n + 3 | < n^2 + 7 for n ≥ 3:\\n   For n≥3: n^2 -7n +4 > 0 (discriminant 49-16=33, roots approx (7±sqrt33)/2 ≈ (7±5.744)/2 -> about 0.628 and 6.372. For n≥7, clearly positive; check n=3..6 manually).\\n   Compute for n=3: 9 - 21 + 4 = -8 (negative).\\n   n=4:16-28+4=-8.\\n   n=5:25-35+4=-6.\\n   n=6:36-42+4=-2.\\n   So for n≥7, n^2 -7n +4>0, i.e., n^2+7 > 7n -3. Thus for n≥7, | -7n + 3 | = 7n-3 < n^2+7, hence | -7n + 3 | < d. Then the only way d | (-7n+3) is if -7n+3 = 0, which gives n = 3/7, not an integer. So no solutions for n≥7.\\n\\n   We already tested n=1..6 and found integer values only at n=2 and n=5.\\n\\n4) Compute the corresponding integer values of the expression:\\n   For n=2: (2^3+3)/(2^2+7) = 11/11 = 1.\\n   For n=5: (5^3+3)/(5^2+7) = 128/32 = 4.\\n\\n   The problem says: “Instead of finding all positive integers making the given rational expression a positive integer, simply find k, where k is the positive integer such that for each such positive integer, it equals the value of the expression plus k.”\\n\\n   Let the positive integer n be expressed as n = E(n) + k, where E(n) = (n^3+3)/(n^2+7).\\n   For each n that makes E(n) an integer (i.e., n=2 or n=5), we require the same k works.\\n\\n   For n=2: 2 = 1 + k => k=1.\\n   For n=5: 5 = 4 + k => k=1.\\n\\n   Both give k=1, so k=1 is consistent.\\n\\n5) Now, using this k=1, we must: “Find all the values of m for which the zeros of 2x^2 - m x - 8 differ by |m - k|.” Here k=1.\\n\\n   For quadratic 2x^2 - m x - 8 = 0, the roots are:\\n   x = [m ± sqrt(m^2 + 64)] / 4.\\n\\n   The difference between the zeros is:\\n   Δx = | [m + sqrt(m^2 + 64)]/4 - [m - sqrt(m^2 + 64)]/4 | = | (2 sqrt(m^2 + 64))/4 | = (1/2) * sqrt(m^2 + 64).\\n\\n   So the condition is:\\n   (1/2) * sqrt(m^2 + 64) = |m - 1|.\\n\\n   Square both sides:\\n   (1/4)(m^2 + 64) = (m - 1)^2.\\n   Multiply by 4:\\n   m^2 + 64 = 4(m^2 - 2m + 1) = 4m^2 - 8m + 4.\\n\\n   Rearrange:\\n   0 = 4m^2 - 8m + 4 - (m^2 + 64) = 3m^2 - 8m - 60.\\n\\n   So we solve 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0.\\n\\n   Discriminant: Δ = (-8)^2 - 4*3*(-60) = 64 + 720 = 784.\\n   sqrt(784) = 28.\\n\\n   So m = [8 ± 28]/(2*3) = [8 ± 28]/6.\\n   m1 = (8 + 28)/6 = 36/6 = 6.\\n   m2 = (8 - 28)/6 = -20/6 = -10/3.\\n\\n   Both satisfy the squared equation. Check they satisfy original absolute equation:\\n\\n   For m=6:\\n   LHS difference = (1/2)*sqrt(6^2 + 64) = (1/2)*sqrt(36+64)= (1/2)*10 = 5.\\n   RHS = |6 - 1| = 5. OK.\\n\\n   For m = -10/3:\\n   LHS difference = (1/2)*sqrt((100/9) + 64) = (1/2)*sqrt((100/9) + (576/9)) = (1/2)*sqrt(676/9) = (1/2)*(26/3) = 13/3.\\n   RHS = |-10/3 - 1| = |-10/3 - 3/3| = |-13/3| = 13/3. OK.\\n\\n   Therefore, the values of m are 6 and -10/3.\",\n    \"answer\": \"6, -10/3\"\n}",
