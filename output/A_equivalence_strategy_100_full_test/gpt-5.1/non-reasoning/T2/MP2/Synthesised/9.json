  "math_problem": "Given a set $A$ with $n \\geq 1$ elements, the pairs in a consistent 2-configuration form a partition of $A$. A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair. Find the number of consistent 2-configurations of $A$ of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. Instead of determining the number of partitions of the set into pairs that form a single cell, simply find $k = n + 5$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the set $A$ that admits a consistent 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell. A best-of-9 series is to be played between two teams; that is, the first team to win 5 games is the winner. The Mathletes have a chance of $2 / 3$ of winning any given game. What is the probability that exactly $k$ games will need to be played to determine a winner?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n  \"reasoning\": \"A 2-configuration of order 1 with exactly 1 cell consists of exactly one pair, and the pairs form a partition of A. Thus A must have exactly 2 elements (one pair), so n = 2. Then k = n + 5 = 7. In a best-of-9 series, exactly k = 7 games are played if and only if, after 6 games, neither team has yet won 5 (so each has at most 4 wins), and then one team wins game 7 to reach 5. A team cannot reach 5 wins before game 7 if we are to play exactly 7 games. This means after 6 games, a possible score is 4–2 for either team; the team with 4 wins then wins game 7. Let M be the Mathletes, O the opponents. Case 1: Mathletes win the series 5–2. After 6 games, Mathletes must be 4–2. Number of sequences of 6 games with 4 M wins and 2 O wins is C(6,4) = 15. Probability of any such sequence is (2/3)^4(1/3)^2. Then Mathletes win game 7 with probability 2/3. So Case 1 probability = 15 * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3). Case 2: Opponents win the series 5–2. After 6 games, opponents must be 4–2. Number of sequences of 6 games with 2 M wins and 4 O wins is C(6,2) = 15. Probability of any such sequence is (2/3)^2(1/3)^4. Then opponents win game 7 with probability 1/3. So Case 2 probability = 15 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^4 * (1/3). Total probability: 15*(2/3)^4*(1/3)^2*(2/3) + 15*(2/3)^2*(1/3)^4*(1/3) = 15*(2/3)^5*(1/3)^2 + 15*(2/3)^2*(1/3)^5. Factor out 15*(2/3)^2*(1/3)^2: 15*(2/3)^2*(1/3)^2 *[(2/3)^3 + (1/3)^3] = 15*(4/9)*(1/9)*[(8/27)+(1/27)] = 15*(4/81)*(9/27) = 15*(4/81)*(1/3) = 15*(4/243) = 60/243 = 20/81.\",\n  \"answer\": \"20/81\"\n}",
