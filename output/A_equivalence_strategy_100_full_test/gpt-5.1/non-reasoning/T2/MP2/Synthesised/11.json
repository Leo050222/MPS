  "math_problem": "Wendy eats sushi for lunch. She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, labeled as follows:\n\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} A & B & C \\\\ D & E & F \\\\ \\end{array}$\n\nwhere pieces are adjacent if they share a side (not counting diagonally), with adjacencies $A$-$B$, $A$-$D$, $B$-$C$, $B$-$E$, $C$-$F$, $D$-$E$, $E$-$F$. The pieces of sushi are distinguishable. She can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other remaining pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row. Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers randomly (and independently) chosen from the range $[0,1]$. Find the probability that $a$, $b$ and $k$ form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"First, interpret the graph of sushi pieces A–F arranged in a 2×3 grid with adjacencies A–B, A–D, B–C, B–E, C–F, D–E, E–F. We are told to consider the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row. The top row is A, B, C; its endpoints are A and C. After removing A and C, the remaining vertices are B, D, E, F. Now list which edges among the original adjacency list still exist only between these remaining vertices: the original edges are A–B (A removed), A–D (A removed), B–C (C removed), B–E (both present), C–F (C removed), D–E (both present), E–F (both present). Thus in the induced subgraph on {B, D, E, F} the edges are B–E, D–E, and E–F. The degree of F in this induced subgraph, deg(F), counts edges incident to F and thus is 1 (only E–F). The problem defines k = deg(F) + 0, so k = 1.\\n\\nNext, let a and b be independent uniform random variables on [0,1]. We want the probability that a, b, and k form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle. Since k = 1 is fixed, the side lengths are {a, b, 1}. For three lengths x, y, z to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequalities: x + y > z for all permutations, or equivalently the largest side must be less than the sum of the other two and greater than their difference. Because a, b ∈ [0,1] and the third side is 1, the maximum of {a, b, 1} is always 1 (since a, b ≤ 1). So the largest side is 1. The triangle inequalities then become:\\n1) 1 < a + b (largest side less than sum of the other two)\\n2) a ≤ b + 1 (always true because b ≥ 0 and a ≤ 1)\\n3) b ≤ a + 1 (always true because a ≥ 0 and b ≤ 1)\\nThus the only nontrivial condition for triangle existence with sides a, b, 1 is a + b > 1.\\n\\nNow, for this triangle to be obtuse, the side opposite the obtuse angle must satisfy c^2 > a^2 + b^2, where c is the longest side. Since the longest side is 1, the obtuse condition is:\\n1^2 > a^2 + b^2 → a^2 + b^2 < 1.\\nTherefore, the combined conditions for an obtuse triangle with side lengths a, b, 1 are:\\n- a ∈ [0,1]\\n- b ∈ [0,1]\\n- a + b > 1 (triangle inequality)\\n- a^2 + b^2 < 1 (obtuse with 1 as largest side)\\n\\nWe must compute the probability that a, b chosen uniformly from the unit square [0,1]×[0,1] satisfy these inequalities. Geometrically, this is the area of the region in the unit square above the line a + b = 1 and inside the quarter circle a^2 + b^2 = 1.\\n\\nIn the unit square, the quarter circle of radius 1 centered at the origin is given by a^2 + b^2 ≤ 1, and the line a + b = 1 runs from (0,1) to (1,0). The region a + b > 1 is the open half-plane above this diagonal, and within [0,1]^2 it is the upper-right triangle with vertices (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). The desired region is the part of this triangle lying inside the quarter circle a^2 + b^2 < 1.\\n\\nNote that the points (1,0) and (0,1) lie on the quarter circle since 1^2 + 0^2 = 1 and 0^2 + 1^2 = 1. For any point in the triangle with both coordinates between 0 and 1 and not on the axes, a^2 + b^2 < 1 holds only within the quarter circle. The region we want can be described more conveniently by solving for b as a function of a.\\n\\nWithin [0,1], the quarter circle is given by b = sqrt(1 - a^2). The diagonal a + b = 1 gives b = 1 - a. We want the area where:\\n- 0 ≤ a ≤ 1\\n- 0 ≤ b ≤ 1\\n- b > 1 - a\\n- b < sqrt(1 - a^2)\\nThis implies 1 - a < sqrt(1 - a^2). We need to determine for which a in [0,1] this holds. Solve 1 - a = sqrt(1 - a^2). Squaring both sides:\\n(1 - a)^2 = 1 - a^2\\n1 - 2a + a^2 = 1 - a^2\\n1 - 2a + a^2 - 1 + a^2 = 0\\n2a^2 - 2a = 0\\n2a(a - 1) = 0\\nSo a = 0 or a = 1. On [0,1], check which side of the equality gives the inequality 1 - a < sqrt(1 - a^2):\\n- At a = 0.5: 1 - a = 0.5; sqrt(1 - a^2) = sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.866; so 0.5 < 0.866, so the inequality holds.\\nThus for all a in (0,1), we have 1 - a < sqrt(1 - a^2). The equalities hold only at a = 0,1. Therefore, for every a in (0,1), the vertical slice of points with both conditions is:\\n1 - a < b < sqrt(1 - a^2).\\nFor a = 0 or a = 1, the interval degenerates to length 0, so they do not contribute to the area.\\n\\nSo the desired area (and probability) is:\\n∫[0 to 1] [sqrt(1 - a^2) - (1 - a)] da.\\nCompute this integral by splitting it:\\n∫[0 to 1] sqrt(1 - a^2) da - ∫[0 to 1] (1 - a) da.\\nThe first integral is the area under the quarter circle from 0 to 1, which equals π/4 (area of a quarter circle of radius 1). The second integral is straightforward:\\n∫[0 to 1] (1 - a) da = [a - a^2/2] from 0 to 1 = (1 - 1/2) - 0 = 1/2.\\nTherefore, the probability is:\\nπ/4 - 1/2.\\nThis is already in exact form and lies between 0 and 1 because π/4 ≈ 0.785, so π/4 - 1/2 ≈ 0.285.\\n\\nThus the probability that a, b, and k = 1 form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle is π/4 - 1/2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"π/4-1/2\"\n}",
