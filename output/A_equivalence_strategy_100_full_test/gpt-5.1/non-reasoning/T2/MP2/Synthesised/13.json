  "math_problem": "The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to $k>0$, find $k$. Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition. A ladder is leaning against a house with its lower end $d$ feet from the house. When the lower end is pulled 9 feet farther from the house, the upper end slides 13 feet down. How long is the ladder (in feet)?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Let the width of the rectangle be w and the length be 3w. Perimeter P = 2(w + 3w) = 8w. Area A = w * 3w = 3w^2. Given P and A are numerically equal: 8w = 3w^2. Since w > 0, divide both sides by w: 8 = 3w, so w = 8/3. We are asked for d = w + 37/3. Thus d = 8/3 + 37/3 = 45/3 = 15. Now consider the ladder problem. Let L be the length of the ladder. Initially, the base is d = 15 ft from the house, so the height up the house is h1, and by the Pythagorean theorem: L^2 = 15^2 + h1^2. When the base is pulled 9 ft farther, the distance from the house becomes 15 + 9 = 24 ft. The upper end slides 13 ft down, so the new height is h2 = h1 - 13. The ladder length is unchanged, so L^2 = 24^2 + (h1 - 13)^2. Set the two expressions for L^2 equal: 15^2 + h1^2 = 24^2 + (h1 - 13)^2. Compute: 225 + h1^2 = 576 + (h1^2 - 26h1 + 169). Simplify the right side: 576 + h1^2 - 26h1 + 169 = h1^2 - 26h1 + 745. So 225 + h1^2 = h1^2 - 26h1 + 745. Cancel h1^2 from both sides: 225 = -26h1 + 745. Then -26h1 = 225 - 745 = -520, so h1 = (-520)/(-26) = 20. The initial height is 20 ft. Use L^2 = 15^2 + 20^2 = 225 + 400 = 625. Thus L = sqrt(625) = 25. The exact ladder length is 25.\",\n    \"answer\": \"25\"\n}",
