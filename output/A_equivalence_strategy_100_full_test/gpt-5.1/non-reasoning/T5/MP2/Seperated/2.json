More directly, solve by separation of variables:\\n  f_{n+1}' / f_{n+1} = f_n,\\nintegrate from 0 to x:\\n  ln f_{n+1}(x) - ln f_{n+1}(0) = ∫_0^x f_n(t) dt.\\nSince f_{n+1}(0)=1, ln f_{n+1}(0)=0, so\\n  ln f_{n+1}(x) = ∫_0^x f_n(t) dt,\\nthus\\n  f_{n+1}(x) = exp( ∫_0^x f_n(t) dt ).\\nWe can compute the first few functions explicitly.\\nBase case:\\n  f_1(x) ≡ 1.\\nThen\\n  f_2(x) = exp( ∫_0^x 1 dt ) = exp(x).\\nNext,\\n  f_3(x) = exp( ∫_0^x f_2(t) dt ) = exp( ∫_0^x e^t dt ) = exp(e^x - 1).\\nSimilarly,\\n  f_4(x) = exp( ∫_0^x f_3(t) dt ) = exp( ∫_0^x exp(e^t - 1) dt ),\\nand so on.\\nWe are told that the limit function g(x) = lim_{n→∞} f_n(x) exists on [0,1); we do not need to prove this, only to use the recurrence to identify g(0) from the boundary condition. From the explicit formula for f_{n+1}:\\n  f_{n+1}(0) = exp( ∫_0^0 f_n(t) dt ) = exp(0) = 1,\\nfor every n. Hence, for all n,\\n  f_n(0) = 1.\\nIf the pointwise limit g(x) = lim_{n→∞} f_n(x) exists at x=0, then it must satisfy\\n  g(0) = lim_{n→∞} f_n(0) = 1.\\nThe problem asks for m = g(0) + 3. Thus\\n  g(0) = 1 ⇒ m = 1 + 3 = 4.\\nSo the answer to Problem 1 is m = 4.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe work in Z^2. For each n ≥ 0,\\n  P_n = { (0,0) } ∪ { (x,y) ∈ Z^2 : x^2 + y^2 = 2^k for some integer k ≤ n }.\\nSo P_n contains the origin and all integer lattice points lying on circles centered at the origin with squared radius 2^k, for k = 0,1,…,n.\\nWe must count, as a function of n, the number of 4-point subsets of P_n that form the vertices of a square.\\nObservation 1: Any square in Z^2 has its side vectors and diagonals with integer coordinates. For a square whose vertices are in Z^2, its center is either in Z^2 or at a half-integer lattice point. Our point set P_n is symmetric under rotations by 90° and reflections about the axes and diagonals because if (x,y) is on a given circle x^2 + y^2 = 2^k, then all its sign and coordinate permutations (±x, ±y) and (±y, ±x) (when applicable) are also on the same circle.\\nImportant simplification: P_n includes only the origin and points on circles centered at the origin. Thus any square whose vertices all lie in P_n must have its vertices either all on one circle, or some possibly at the origin and some on a circle. However, it is easy to check that the origin cannot be a vertex of a non-degenerate square with all vertices in P_n unless the other vertices also lie in P_n in a way that respects lengths and integer coordinates; we check this explicitly.\\nGeneral characterization of integer squares: A square in Z^2 can be described by choosing one vertex A and two perpendicular equal-length vectors u and v with integer coordinates, and vertices A, A+u, A+v, A+u+v. However, because P_n is constrained to lie on circles centered at the origin and at the origin itself, an easier approach is to classify squares by their center.\\nKey fact: If four points form a square and lie on a circle centered at the origin, then the square is centered at the origin. Indeed, if four points lie on a circle centered at O and form a square, the center of that square is the center of the circle; so its center is O. Thus any such square has all vertices on one circle x^2 + y^2 = 2^k, and its center at the origin. Hence, we only need to count inscribed squares in each circle.\\nWe must also check whether there could be squares that use the origin as a vertex and some points on circles of possibly different radii. Suppose 0 is a vertex of a non-degenerate square. Let the square have vertices 0, A, B, C, with A and B adjacent to 0 and C = A + B. Then |A| = |B| = side length s, and A·B = 0 (perpendicular). Distances from the origin: |0|^2 = 0, |A|^2 = |B|^2 = s^2, and |C|^2 = |A+B|^2 = |A|^2 + |B|^2 + 2 A·B = s^2 + s^2 + 0 = 2 s^2. For these points to lie in P_n, we would need 0 in P_n (it is), A, B on some circle(s) x^2 + y^2 = 2^{k1},2^{k2} (but they must have the same squared length s^2), and C on some circle x^2+y^2 = 2^{k3}. Thus we need s^2 to be a power of 2, and 2s^2 to be also a power of 2. If s^2 = 2^k, then 2s^2 = 2^{k+1}, so that is consistent. The real restriction is that A and B, perpendicular integer vectors with |A|^2=|B|^2=2^k, must exist and that k and k+1 be ≤ n to have all points in P_n. However, observe that C = A+B would then have |C|^2 = 2^{k+1}. But A and B lie on the circle with radius sqrt(2^k) centered at the origin, so they are elements of P_n. Similarly, C lies on circle with radius sqrt(2^{k+1}). All three A,B,C are in P_n, and 0 is in P_n. So such squares exist in principle and are not centered at the origin.\\nTherefore, there are two types of squares to consider:\\n  (I) Squares with all four vertices on the same circle x^2 + y^2 = 2^k (centered at the origin).\\n  (II) Squares with one vertex at (0,0) and the other three on circles of squared radii 2^k and 2^{k+1} as described.\\nWe need to count both types, for all k with appropriate bounds, as a function of n.\\nWe proceed carefully.\\n\\nStep 1: Lattice points on circle x^2 + y^2 = 2^k.\\nWrite 2^k as a sum of two squares. Classical number theory: The number of representations of 2^k as x^2 + y^2 with x,y integers is finite and highly constrained. Note that 2 = 1^2 + 1^2. Then 2^k = (1^2+1^2)^k. By properties of sums of two squares, a prime p ≡ 3 mod 4 must appear with even exponent for it to be a sum of two squares, and 2 is 2 ≡ 2 mod 4; powers of 2 remain representable as sums of two squares. More concretely, we can try small k.\\nk=0: 2^0 = 1. Solutions to x^2 + y^2 = 1 over Z: (±1,0) and (0,±1). So 4 points.\\nk=1: 2^1 = 2. Solutions: (±1,±1). There are 4 such: (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1).\\nk=2: 4. Solutions x^2 + y^2 = 4: (±2,0),(0,±2). Again 4 points.\\nWe can guess the pattern: For k odd, solutions have x and y both odd and of absolute value 1, 3, etc. But actually, check k=3: 2^3=8. Solve x^2 + y^2 = 8. Possible squares ≤8: 0,1,4,9. Try combinations: 0+8 (no 8 is a square), 1+7(no), 4+4(2^2+2^2). So solutions: (±2,±2), 4 points.\\nObserve that for all k ≥ 1, the only integer solutions to x^2 + y^2 = 2^k are of the form (±2^{(k-1)/2}, ±2^{(k-1)/2}) if k odd, or (±2^{k/2}, 0),(0,±2^{k/2}) if k even. This can be proved by induction using 2-adic valuation reasoning:\\n- If k is even, then 2^k = 4·2^{k-2}, so write x=2x',y=2y'; then x'^2 + y'^2 = 2^{k-2}. Iterating, we reduce to k=0, where solutions are (±1,0),(0,±1), corresponding to coordinate axes.\\n- If k is odd, then factor out one power of 2: 2^k = 2·2^{k-1}. At least one of x,y must be odd; a bit of modular arithmetic shows that both must be odd, and we again reduce to the k=1 pattern where up to scaling, solutions are diagonal points (±1,±1).\\nThus, for every k ≥ 0, there are exactly 4 integer points on the circle x^2 + y^2 = 2^k.\\nExplicitly:\\n  If k=0: points: (±1,0),(0,±1).\\n  If k even, k=2m>0: points: (±2^m,0),(0,±2^m).\\n  If k odd, k=2m+1: points: (±2^m,±2^m).\\nTherefore, each circle contributes exactly 4 lattice points in P_n.\\n\\nStep 2: Count type (I) squares: squares inscribed in a circle and centered at origin.\\nGiven a circle x^2 + y^2 = 2^k with 4 lattice points, do these 4 points form a square with center at the origin? Plot them:\\n- For k even, points: (±R,0),(0,±R), where R=2^{k/2}. These four points form a square: vertices at the axis points form a square with side length R√2 and center (0,0).\\n- For k odd, points: (±R,±R) with R=2^{(k-1)/2}. These also form a square: the points (R,R),(R,-R),(-R,R),(-R,-R) are the vertices of an axis-aligned square (sides parallel to axes) with side 2R and center (0,0).\\nThus, for each k, the 4 points on circle x^2 + y^2 = 2^k are the vertices of exactly one square centered at the origin.\\nWe also check whether any other square can be inscribed in the same circle with integer vertices. But since there are only 4 lattice points on the circle, any 4-point subset of that circle is the whole 4-point set; and this set already gives one square. There is no other subset or rearrangement; selecting them always yields the same geometric square. So each k contributes exactly 1 square of type (I).\\nFor n ≥ 0, there are circles for k=0,1,…,n; each contributes 1 square. So number of type (I) squares in P_n is:\\n  S_I(n) = n+1.\\n\\nStep 3: Count type (II) squares with one vertex at origin and three others on circles of radii sqrt(2^k) and sqrt(2^{k+1}).\\nWe need to find all squares with vertices {0, A, B, C}, with A and B at distance sqrt(2^k) from origin (thus |A|^2=|B|^2=2^k) and perpendicular, and C = A + B at distance sqrt(2^{k+1}) from origin (|C|^2=2^{k+1}), and 0 ≤ k ≤ n-1 (to ensure both radii occur in P_n). Also, all points must be in P_n, so we need k ≤ n (for A,B) and k+1 ≤ n (for C), hence k ≤ n-1.\\nFrom the classification of points on each circle, the circle of radius sqrt(2^k) has 4 points, either axis points (k even) or diagonal points (k odd). We must check whether we can choose two distinct points A,B from this set such that A·B=0 (perpendicular) and C=A+B is one of the 4 points on the circle of radius sqrt(2^{k+1}).\\nCase 1: k even.\\nThen points on circle 2^k are (±R,0),(0,±R) with R=2^{k/2}. Pick A,B among these four.\\nCompute dot products:\\n- (R,0) · (-R,0) = -R^2 ≠ 0.\\n- (0,R) · (0,-R) = -R^2 ≠ 0.\\n- (R,0) · (0,R) = 0, similarly (R,0) ⟂ (0,-R), (-R,0) ⟂ (0,R), (-R,0) ⟂ (0,-R).\\nThus there are perpendicular pairs, e.g. A=(R,0), B=(0,R). Then C=A+B=(R,R). Its squared length is |C|^2 = R^2 + R^2 = 2R^2 = 2·2^k/?? Wait: R^2 = 2^k/?? We have R = 2^{k/2}, so R^2 = 2^k/?? No, exact: R^2 = (2^{k/2})^2 = 2^k. Then |C|^2 = 2·2^k = 2^{k+1}, as required.\\nNow check if C lies among integer points on circle x^2 + y^2 = 2^{k+1}. For k+1 odd, that circle's points are of form (±S,±S) with S=2^{(k+1-1)/2}=2^{k/2}=R. So the 4 points are (±R,±R). Our C=(R,R) is one of them, so indeed C ∈ P_n.\\nSo for even k, we can make squares of type (II).\\nCount how many distinct squares arise for each even k with 0 ≤ k ≤ n-1.\\nCircle for 2^k has four points: call them E=(R,0), W=(-R,0), N=(0,R), S=(0,-R).\\nPerpendicular pairs that can be used as edges from the origin are those where vectors from 0 to A,B are perpendicular nonzero vectors; i.e., choose A,B from {E,W,N,S} such that A·B=0. Those pairs are:\\n  (E,N),(E,S),(W,N),(W,S), and the reversed ordered pairs (N,E),(S,E),(N,W),(S,W) if order matters. However, a given square {0,A,B,A+B} does not depend on the ordering of A,B or on which vertex we consider as A or B.\\nGiven an unordered pair {A,B} with A·B=0, the resulting square vertices are {0,A,B,A+B}.\\nList the unordered perpendicular pairs:\\n  {E,N}, {E,S}, {W,N}, {W,S}.\\nAre some of these pairs giving the same 4-point set?\\nCompute C=A+B in each case:\\n- For {E,N}: A=(R,0), B=(0,R) ⇒ C=(R,R).\\n- For {E,S}: A=(R,0), B=(0,-R) ⇒ C=(R,-R).\\n- For {W,N}: A=(-R,0), B=(0,R) ⇒ C=(-R,R).\\n- For {W,S}: A=(-R,0), B=(0,-R) ⇒ C=(-R,-R).\\nThus the four resulting C's are distinct points on circle 2^{k+1}. Meanwhile, the sets of vertices are:\\n  {0,E,N,(R,R)},\\n  {0,E,S,(R,-R)},\\n  {0,W,N,(-R,R)},\\n  {0,W,S,(-R,-R)}.\\nWe must check if any of these 4 vertex-sets coincide as sets. They don't: each has a unique nonzero vertex not shared with the others (e.g., (R,R) only appears as the C for {E,N}, etc.). So for each even k, we get exactly 4 distinct squares of type (II).\\nWe should also consider whether picking A,B along other perpendicular pairs might produce duplicates, but we have exhausted all perpendicular unordered pairs. There are 4.\\nAlso note that for a given square, the origin is one vertex, and the other vertex opposite to origin is C, on circle 2^{k+1}, while the two remaining vertices A,B are on circle 2^k. We do not get any extra distinct squares by starting from circle 2^{k+1} and considering edges differently; those are the same squares already counted.\\nSo for each even k with 0 ≤ k ≤ n-1, we have 4 squares of type (II).\\nCase 2: k odd.\\nNow circle 2^k has diagonal points D1=(R,R), D2=(R,-R), D3=(-R,R), D4=(-R,-R), where R=2^{(k-1)/2}.\\nWe need perpendicular pairs among these 4 vectors.\\nCompute dot products:\\n- D1·D2 = (R,R)·(R,-R) = R^2 - R^2 = 0.\\n- D1·D3 = (R,R)·(-R,R) = -R^2 + R^2 = 0.\\n- D1·D4 = (R,R)·(-R,-R) = -R^2 -R^2 = -2R^2 ≠ 0.\\n- D2·D3 = (R,-R)·(-R,R) = -R^2 -R^2 = -2R^2 ≠ 0.\\n- D2·D4 = (R,-R)·(-R,-R) = -R^2 + R^2 = 0.\\n- D3·D4 = (-R,R)·(-R,-R) = R^2 - R^2 = 0.\\nSo perpendicular unordered pairs are:\\n  {D1,D2}, {D1,D3}, {D2,D4}, {D3,D4}.\\nNow compute C=A+B for each:\\n- {D1,D2}: A=(R,R),B=(R,-R) ⇒ C=(2R,0).\\n- {D1,D3}: A=(R,R),B=(-R,R) ⇒ C=(0,2R).\\n- {D2,D4}: A=(R,-R),B=(-R,-R) ⇒ C=(0,-2R).\\n- {D3,D4}: A=(-R,R),B=(-R,-R) ⇒ C=(-2R,0).\\nNow |C|^2 = (2R)^2 + 0^2 = 4R^2.\\nWe know k=2m+1, so R=2^m. Then R^2=2^{2m}, 4R^2 = 2^{2m+2}.\\nWe want |C|^2 to equal 2^{k+1} = 2^{2m+2}.\\nWe see they match: 4R^2 = 2^{2m+2} indeed equals 2^{k+1}, so that condition is satisfied.\\nWe need to check that C lies among the lattice points of circle 2^{k+1}. For k+1 even, k+1=2m+2 ⇒ the circle x^2 + y^2 = 2^{2m+2} has points (±S,0),(0,±S) with S=2^{(k+1)/2} = 2^{m+1} = 2R. Indeed, the Cs we found are (±2R,0),(0,±2R), exactly those points.\\nSo for each odd k with k ≤ n-1, we again find 4 perpendicular unordered pairs and get 4 candidate squares of type (II):\\n  {0,D1,D2,(2R,0)},\\n  {0,D1,D3,(0,2R)},\\n  {0,D2,D4,(0,-2R)},\\n  {0,D3,D4,(-2R,0)}.\\nAgain these 4 are distinct sets of 4 vertices, for the same reasoning as in the even case.\\nThus, regardless of parity of k, as long as 0 ≤ k ≤ n-1, there are exactly 4 distinct squares of type (II) involving radii 2^k and 2^{k+1} and having origin as a vertex.\\nSo for each k from 0 to n-1 inclusive, we get 4 squares.\\nTotal number of type (II) squares is\\n  S_II(n) = 4·(number of integers k with 0 ≤ k ≤ n-1) = 4·max(n,0) = 4n\\n(for n≥0; if n=0, the range 0≤k≤-1 is empty, so S_II(0)=0; the formula 4n gives 0, so consistent).\\n\\nStep 4: Check for any other squares.\\nWe have considered:\\n- Squares with all four vertices on a single circle centered at origin (type I).\\n- Squares with one vertex at origin and other three on circles of radii sqrt(2^k) and sqrt(2^{k+1}) (type II).\\nCould there be squares whose four vertices lie on two different circles, neither including the origin, or squares not centered at origin and not using origin as a vertex, but with vertices on two distinct circles?\\nBecause all points of P_n except origin lie on circles centered at origin, any square not centered at origin must have its vertices at two different distances from origin (since in a generic translated square, different vertices are at different distances from origin). We must check whether it is possible for four vertices of a square to lie on two circles centered at origin, with none at the origin.\\nConsider a square with center C ≠ 0. Let its vertices be V1,V2,V3,V4. Their distances to origin are |V_i|. Since the square is symmetric about its center, the distances of opposite vertices to origin match pairwise, but may differ between pairs. So at most two distinct radii occur (one for each opposite pair). For all four vertices to lie in P_n, each of their distances squared must be among {0,2^0,2^1,…,2^n}. We ask whether there is a configuration where the center is not the origin, all four vertices are on circles with these specific radii (powers of 2), and none is the origin.\\nHowever, observe that our classification of lattice points at each radius 2^k is extremely sparse: each circle 2^k has only the 4 points we described. The geometric configurations of those points are just a square centered at origin (already counted) and its scaled versions. If we try to form a square not centered at origin using only these discrete points, note that any vertex on circle 2^k is of the form (±2^{⌊k/2⌋},0) or (0,±2^{⌊k/2⌋}) or (±2^{⌊k/2⌋},±2^{⌊k/2⌋}). For any such candidate square whose center is not at the origin, a small case analysis (by scaling) shows it must be obtained from the unit configurations by translation and rotation, but the only available points fall along axes and diagonals through the origin. A non-origin center would break this alignment, and generally there will be no four such points; concretely, one can test possibilities like choosing two points from one circle and two from another and checking whether the four can form a square. Each attempt fails because we never get the correct pattern of midpoints and distances when constrained to axis/diagonal points about origin.\\nA more algebraic argument: Let C be the center of such a square, with vertices C±u and C±v, where u,v are perpendicular with equal length. Then squared lengths to origin are |C±u|^2, |C±v|^2. For opposite vertices C±u, we have |C+u|^2 = |C-u|^2 = |C|^2 + |u|^2, similarly |C+v|^2 = |C-v|^2 = |C|^2 + |v|^2. Since |u|=|v|, all four vertices lie on the same circle centered at origin. Thus any square with vertices in P_n whose vertices all lie on circles centered at origin (not including the origin) must actually be a square inscribed in some single circle and centered at origin. That is exactly type (I). The only way to use two different radii is to place a vertex at origin (since then the opposite vertex is at different radius), which gives type (II). This argument rules out any additional types.\\nTherefore, the full set of squares in P_n is exactly the union of type (I) and type (II).\\n\\nStep 5: Total count.\\nFor n ≥ 0,\\n  S_I(n) = n+1,\\n  S_II(n) = 4n.\\nHence total number of 4-point subsets forming a square is\\n  S(n) = S_I(n) + S_II(n) = (n+1) + 4n = 5n + 1.\\nCheck small n to validate.\\n- n=0: P_0 includes (0,0) and points with x^2+y^2=2^0=1: (±1,0),(0,±1). So P_0 = {O,E,W,N,S}. Squares:\\n  Type I: k=0 circle gives square with vertices E,W,N,S centered at origin.\\n  Type II: k from 0 to n-1: empty set since n-1=-1. So only 1 square; formula 5n+1=1 OK.\\n- n=1: P_1 includes origin, circle k=0 (axis points at radius1), and circle k=1 (diagonal points at radius sqrt 2). Circles:\\n  k=0: (±1,0),(0,±1).\\n  k=1: (±1,±1).\\nSquares:\\n  Type I: one from k=0, one from k=1: total 2.\\n  Type II: k=0 only (since k≤n-1=0). For k=0, we described 4 squares: vertices\\n    {0,(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)},\\n    {0,(1,0),(0,-1),(1,-1)},\\n    {0,(-1,0),(0,1),(-1,1)},\\n    {0,(-1,0),(0,-1),(-1,-1)}.\\n  So total 6 squares. Formula 5·1+1=6 OK.\\n- n=2: P_2 includes origin, k=0 and k=2 circles (axis points with radii 1 and 2), and k=1 circle (diagonal points with radius √2). We expect S(2)=5·2+1=11.\\n  Type I: k=0,1,2 ⇒ 3 squares.\\n  Type II: k=0,1 ⇒ 4+4=8 squares.\\n  Total 11. One could brute-force check but pattern is consistent.\\nSo formula S(n) = 5n+1 is correct.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: We found g(0)=1, hence m = g(0)+3 = 4.\\nProblem 2: Number of four-point subsets forming a square in P_n is 5n+1.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"5n+1\"\n}",
