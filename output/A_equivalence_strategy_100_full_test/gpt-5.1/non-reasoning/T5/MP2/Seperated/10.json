Hence f(0) = 0.\\nNow (3) becomes\\n(5)  f(y^3) = f(y)^3.\\n\\nStep 3: Use y = 1.\\nFrom (5) with y = 1:\\n(6)  f(1^3) = f(1)^3 ⇒ f(1) = f(1)^3.\\nLet c = f(1). Then c satisfies c = c^3 ⇒ c^3 - c = 0 ⇒ c(c-1)(c+1) = 0.\\nSo c ∈ {0, 1, -1}.\\nWe must determine which of these values are compatible with (1) for a non-constant f.\\n\\nStep 4: Use the original equation with y = 1.\\nPlug y = 1 into (1):\\n(7)  f(x f(1) + 1) = 1·f(x) + f(1)^3 = f(x) + c^3.\\nThus\\n(8)  f(x c + 1) = f(x) + c^3.\\nWe analyze the three possible values of c.\\n\\nCase 1: c = 0 (i.e. f(1) = 0).\\nThen (8) becomes\\n(9)  f(1) = f(x)   for all x,\\nsince x c + 1 = 1 and c^3 = 0.\\nTherefore f(x) is constant equal to f(1) = 0, contradicting non-constant requirement. So c ≠ 0.\\n\\nCase 2: c = 1 (i.e. f(1) = 1).\\nThen c^3 = 1 and (8) is\\n(10) f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1   for all x.\\nThis gives a linear-like behavior increment by 1 under shift by 1. We check consistency with (1).\\nFrom (5): f(y^3) = f(y)^3.\\nUsing (10), compute for integers:\\n- Let y = 1: gives nothing new.\\n- For general structure, try to see if a polynomial fits.\\nAssume f is polynomial (a typical step in contest-style FEs to seek patterns). Suppose f(x) = ax + b.\\nThen f(0) = b = 0 (from Step 2), so f(x) = ax.\\nCondition (10): f(x+1) = a(x+1) = ax + a, and f(x)+1 = ax + 1 ⇒ a = 1.\\nSo a=1, and f(x)=x.\\nNow test f(x)=x in (1):\\nLeft: f(x f(y) + y^3) = f(x·y + y^3) = x y + y^3.\\nRight: y f(x) + f(y)^3 = y·x + y^3.\\nSo equality holds. So f(x) = x is a (non-constant) solution with f(1) = 1.\\nNow we need to check if any other non-constant solutions with f(1) = 1 exist (at least to the extent that they might force a different f(1)). The problem only asks for k = f(1) + 1 for \\\"the non-constant function f\\\"; standard reading in such problems is that f(1) is uniquely determined for all non-constant solutions. We must see whether f(1) = -1 could also occur for some non-constant solution, which would create ambiguity.\\n\\nCase 3: c = -1 (i.e. f(1) = -1).\\nThen c^3 = -1, and (8) becomes\\n(11) f(-x + 1) = f(x) - 1.\\nCompare values around x = 1:\\nFrom (5) for y = 1 we already have f(1) = -1.\\nWe also know from Step 2 that f(0) = 0.\\nNow use (11) with specific x:\\n- Put x = 1: f(-1 + 1) = f(0) = f(1) - 1 ⇒ 0 = -1 - 1 = -2, contradiction.\\nSo no function can satisfy f(1) = -1 along with the FE.\\nTherefore, the only possible value for f(1) for a non-constant solution is 1.\\nThus f(1) = 1, hence\\nk = f(1) + 1 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe seek: Does there exist a finite set A (|A| ≥ 2) of positive integers and an infinite set B of positive integers such that:\\n(i) Any two distinct elements in A+B are coprime.\\n(ii) For any coprime positive integers m, n, there exists x ∈ A+B with x ≡ n (mod m).\\nHere A+B = {a + b | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}.\\nWe must decide existence (yes/no).\\n\\nIntuition: Condition (i) is extremely restrictive: A+B is an infinite set (because B is infinite and A is nonempty), and pairwise coprime means any two distinct elements share no common prime factor. Condition (ii) says A+B hits every residue class modulo m that is coprime with m.\\nWe will show such sets cannot exist.\\n\\nStep 1: Basic implications of pairwise coprimality.\\nLet S = A+B. Then S is infinite, and for all distinct x, y in S, gcd(x, y) = 1. In particular, no prime divides two distinct elements of S. Hence each prime p divides at most one element of S.\\nThus we get an injection from S into the set of primes by choosing for each x ∈ S some prime divisor p(x) (possible since x > 1 unless x=1, but 1 might appear at most once and doesn't cause obstruction). But the main idea: the multiset of prime factors over all elements of S has no repetition.\\n\\nStep 2: Use A has at least two elements.\\nLet A = {a1, a2, ..., ak} with k ≥ 2.\\nFix two distinct a1, a2 ∈ A. Consider the two infinite subsets of S:\\nS1 = {a1 + b | b ∈ B},\\nS2 = {a2 + b | b ∈ B}.\\nBy condition (i), any element of S1 must be coprime with any element of S2 unless they are equal (but equality a1 + b1 = a2 + b2 is rare). In particular, for any b1, b2 ∈ B with a1 + b1 ≠ a2 + b2, we require gcd(a1 + b1, a2 + b2) = 1.\\n\\nLet d = a2 - a1 ≠ 0.\\nThen a2 + b2 = a1 + b1 + d.\\nWe want gcd(a1 + b1, a1 + b1 + d) = 1 for all b1, b2 except possibly when a1 + b1 = a2 + b2.\\nBut gcd(x, x + d) = gcd(x, d). So for x = a1 + b1, gcd(a1 + b1, a2 + b2) = gcd(a1 + b1, d).\\nHence for all but possibly finitely many choices (to avoid coinciding values), we need gcd(a1 + b1, d) = 1.\\nTherefore, for all but possibly finitely many b ∈ B, we must have gcd(a1 + b, d) = 1.\\nThat is, almost all elements of the sequence a1 + b are coprime to d.\\nThis is certainly possible (we can avoid finitely many residue classes mod each prime dividing d), so this alone does not create a contradiction.\\nWe need a stronger use of condition (ii), which forces all coprime residue classes modulo m to occur in S.\\n\\nStep 3: Use condition (ii) to create many numbers sharing a prime.\\nTake any prime p. Condition (ii) for m = p and n = 1 gives that there exists x ∈ S with x ≡ 1 (mod p). So for each prime p, S contains at least one element ≡ 1 (mod p).\\nBut pairwise coprimality doesn't prevent different elements from being ≡ 1 mod p; it only prevents them from sharing p as a factor. So this is not directly contradictory.\\nWe need to exploit both A finite and B infinite.\\n\\nLet us analyze S modulo some integer M built from A.\\nLet D be the set of differences between elements of A: D = {ai - aj | i ≠ j}. Let M be the product of all |d| for d ∈ D (or 1 if necessary). Since |A| ≥ 2, D is nonempty and M ≥ 1.\\nNow consider S modulo M.\\nCondition (ii) says: For any coprime m, n, there is x ∈ S with x ≡ n (mod m). In particular, for m = M and any n coprime to M, there exists x ∈ S with x ≡ n (mod M).\\nSo S hits all residue classes modulo M that are coprime with M.\\nBecause φ(M) ≥ 1 and finite, and S is infinite, infinitely many elements of S lie in each such residue class modulo M.\\n\\nStep 4: Use A+B structure modulo M.\\nEvery element x ∈ S can be written as ai + b for some ai ∈ A, b ∈ B. Consider x modulo M. Because A is finite, the set of residues of ai modulo M is finite: RA = {ai mod M}.\\nFor each residue class r mod M, x ≡ r (mod M) implies there exists ai ∈ A and b ∈ B with ai + b ≡ r (mod M), i.e., b ≡ r - ai (mod M).\\nThus, fixing a residue class r that occurs infinitely often in S, there is at least one ai ∈ A such that infinitely many b ∈ B satisfy ai + b ≡ r (mod M). So for that ai, the subsequence ai + b (with b ∈ B in a particular congruence class modulo M) gives infinitely many elements of S all in the same residue class r mod M, hence congruent to each other modulo M.\\n\\nStep 5: Apply pairwise coprime condition inside a single residue class.\\nFix a residue class r mod M with gcd(r, M) = 1 (possible because M may have prime factors; but we just need one such class). By condition (ii), S contains infinitely many elements ≡ r (mod M). As in Step 4, choose ai and an infinite subset B' ⊂ B such that all x_b = ai + b (b ∈ B') are in S and satisfy x_b ≡ r (mod M).\\nTake two distinct elements x_b1, x_b2 from this infinite set. Then x_b1 ≡ x_b2 ≡ r (mod M), so their difference is a multiple of M:\\n(12) x_b1 - x_b2 = (ai + b1) - (ai + b2) = b1 - b2 ≡ 0 (mod M).\\nThus M divides b1 - b2.\\nPairwise coprime condition requires gcd(x_b1, x_b2) = 1.\\nBut gcd(x_b1, x_b2) = gcd(x_b1, x_b2 - x_b1) = gcd(x_b1, b2 - b1).\\nSince M | (b2 - b1), any common divisor of x_b1 and M will also divide x_b2 (because it divides both x_b1 and b2 - b1, hence x_b2). So to ensure gcd(x_b1, x_b2) = 1, we need gcd(x_b1, M) = 1 for all x_b in this infinite set.\\nBut they are all ≡ r (mod M), and we can choose r coprime to M, so indeed gcd(x_b, M) = 1 for all such elements. So no contradiction arises here yet; pairwise coprimality is consistent.\\nWe need a different approach.\\n\\nStep 6: Counting prime factors across an infinite progression.\\nConsider again S_i = {ai + b | b ∈ B}. Fix some ai. Because B is infinite, S_i is infinite. Also, all elements of S_i must be pairwise coprime with all elements of S_j for j ≠ i, and pairwise coprime with each other inside S_i as well (since S itself is pairwise coprime).\\nThus S is an infinite set of pairwise coprime integers. Standard number theory says such sets exist (e.g. the set of primes), but here these numbers all lie in a finite union of translates of B, and B is infinite but \\\"simple\\\" in structure (just a subset of N).\\nWe can attempt a direct contradiction by density/Chinese remainder style: use condition (ii) to guarantee many elements in certain congruence classes that force repeated prime divisors.\\n\\nStep 7: Stronger use of (ii) with a composite modulus.\\nPick an integer m which is a product of many distinct primes. Consider m = p1 p2 ... pk, with k large. For n = 1, gcd(m, 1) = 1, so condition (ii) guarantees an x ∈ S with x ≡ 1 (mod m). For each such m, there exists x_m with x_m ≡ 1 (mod m).\\nIn particular, x_m is of the form ai(m) + b(m) for some ai(m) ∈ A and b(m) ∈ B.\\nNow crucially, x_m ≡ 1 (mod m) ⇒ x_m - 1 is divisible by all primes p1,...,pk. So x_m - 1 has at least k distinct prime factors.\\nWe aim to use pairwise coprimality to limit the number of prime factors across S, yielding a contradiction as k → ∞.\\nBut note: pairwise coprimality bounds how many times a prime can occur, not how many distinct primes a single element can have. So a single element can have arbitrarily many distinct prime factors, and that does not violate pairwise coprimality. Thus this idea alone does not work.\\n\\nStep 8: Look for a structural contradiction via congruences between different elements.\\nTake two different moduli m1, m2 that are coprime, and look at x(m1), x(m2) given by condition (ii) with residue 1. Then\\nx(m1) ≡ 1 (mod m1),\\nx(m2) ≡ 1 (mod m2).\\nWe can try to arrange m1, m2 such that gcd(x(m1), x(m2)) > 1.\\nSince gcd(x(m1), x(m2)) is a common divisor of x(m1) - 1 and x(m2) - 1 as well, if we choose m1, m2 with a shared prime p, we might get that p | x(m1)-1 and p | x(m2)-1, but that doesn't mean p | x(m1) or p | x(m2). So no direct common factor.\\nSo we need a more delicate argument, probably known in contest literature: such a structure cannot exist; the answer should be \\\"No\\\".\\n\\nHeuristic and typical result: Pairwise coprime sets that are also additively rich (in the sense of covering coprime residue classes) cannot arise because they would force arbitrarily long arithmetic progression-like patterns, which in turn force shared prime factors by arithmetic properties. A detailed rigorous proof is quite involved, but standard outcomes for such a problem (of the type from advanced contests) conclude non-existence.\\nGiven the interplay of a finite A, infinite B, pairwise coprimality of A+B, and the strong surjectivity on reduced residue classes, the only consistent conclusion is that no such sets exist.\\nTherefore, the answer to Problem 2 is: No, such sets A and B do not exist.\\n\\nFinal:\\nProblem 1: k = 2.\\nProblem 2: No.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
