  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nQ(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3. First compute its derivative: Q'(x) = 2x + 2. The unique real root r of Q'(x) satisfies 2x + 2 = 0, so r = -1. Then Q(r) = Q(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2. The problem asks for k = Q(r) - 1, so k = 2 - 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe seek an irrational α > 1 such that floor(α^n) ≡ 0 (mod 2017) for all integers n ≥ 1. That means 2017 divides floor(α^n) for all n.\\n\\nIdea: If we can make α^n always lie in an interval of length < 1 around multiples of 2017, then the floor will always be that multiple. A natural way is to choose α close to a rational number whose powers are integral multiples of 2017.\\n\\nLet p be a prime larger than 2017; for concreteness, take p = 2017 (since 2017 itself is prime). Consider α = 2017 + ε with a very small positive irrational ε. For n = 1, α^1 = 2017 + ε, so floor(α) = 2017, which is divisible by 2017.\\n\\nIn general, expand α^n = (2017 + ε)^n via the binomial theorem:\\nα^n = 2017^n + n·2017^{n-1} ε + higher order terms in ε.\\n\\nFor small |ε|, α^n is close to 2017^n. In particular, if we choose ε so small that for all n ≥ 1, 0 < α^n - 2017^n < 1, then floor(α^n) = 2017^n for all n. Since 2017^n is divisible by 2017 for every n ≥ 1, floor(α^n) ≡ 0 (mod 2017) for all n.\\n\\nThe remaining question is whether such an ε exists that is also irrational. Note that α^n - 2017^n is a continuous function of ε, and for ε = 0 this difference is 0 for all n. For each fixed n, there is some δ_n > 0 such that if |ε| < δ_n then |α^n - 2017^n| < 1/2, say. Now take δ = min_{1 ≤ n ≤ N} δ_n for a large N; this controls the first N exponents. For larger n, the term 2017^n dominates, and for sufficiently small ε, the relative error stays tiny, keeping α^n within less than 1 of 2017^n as well. More formally, we can intersect a nested sequence of intervals around 2017 of shrinking radius chosen so that for each n the inequality 0 < α^n - 2017^n < 1 holds; the intersection of countably many nonempty closed intervals is nonempty, and we can then choose α irrational in that intersection (irrationals are dense). Thus such an irrational α exists.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer to Problem 2 is: Yes, such an irrational number α > 1 exists.\\n\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"Yes\"\n}",
