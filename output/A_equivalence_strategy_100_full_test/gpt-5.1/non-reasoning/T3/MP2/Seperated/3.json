Given P(10) = 331633 and P(-10) = 273373.\\n\\nWrite P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + ... where 0 ≤ a_i < 100, integers.\\nThen:\\nP(10) = a_0 + 10 a_1 + 10^2 a_2 + 10^3 a_3 + ...\\nP(-10) = a_0 - 10 a_1 + 10^2 a_2 - 10^3 a_3 + ... (odd powers negative).\\nBecause coefficients are < 100, P(10) in base 10 directly encodes the coefficients a_i as its digits, assuming no carries beyond a single digit for each coefficient. But here coefficients can be up to 99 (two digits), so we must decode more carefully using the symmetry with P(-10).\\n\\nLet’s express P(10) and P(-10) in base 10 explicitly:\\nP(10) = 331633\\nP(-10) = 273373\\n\\nCompute S = P(10) + P(-10):\\n331633 + 273373 = 605006.\\nCompute D = P(10) - P(-10):\\n331633 - 273373 = 58260.\\n\\nNow in terms of coefficients:\\nS = P(10) + P(-10) = 2(a_0 + 10^2 a_2 + 10^4 a_4 + ... ) (only even powers survive).\\nD = P(10) - P(-10) = 2(10 a_1 + 10^3 a_3 + 10^5 a_5 + ... ) (only odd powers survive) because signs differ.\\n\\nSo:\\nE(x) = a_0 + 10^2 a_2 + 10^4 a_4 + ... = S/2 = 605006 / 2 = 302503.\\nO(x) = 10 a_1 + 10^3 a_3 + 10^5 a_5 + ... = D/2 = 58260 / 2 = 29130.\\n\\nFirst decode even-power coefficients from E = 302503. Write E in base 10 as concatenation according to powers of 100 (since 10^2 factors):\\nE = a_0 + 100 a_2 + 100^2 a_4 + ...\\nBecause each a_i < 100, each acts like a two-digit block in base 100.\\n\\nFind a_0 and the rest by repeated division by 100:\\na_0 = E mod 100 = 302503 mod 100 = 3.\\nE1 = (E - a_0)/100 = (302503 - 3)/100 = 302500/100 = 3025.\\nThen a_2 = E1 mod 100 = 3025 mod 100 = 25.\\nE2 = (E1 - a_2)/100 = (3025 - 25)/100 = 3000/100 = 30.\\nThen a_4 = E2 mod 100 = 30.\\nE3 = (E2 - a_4)/100 = (30 - 30)/100 = 0, so higher even coefficients are 0.\\nHence a_0 = 3, a_2 = 25, a_4 = 30, and a_6, a_8, ... = 0.\\n\\nNext decode odd-power coefficients from O = 29130.\\nRecall O = 10 a_1 + 10^3 a_3 + 10^5 a_5 + ... = 10(a_1 + 10^2 a_3 + 10^4 a_5 + ...).\\nSo W = a_1 + 100 a_3 + 100^2 a_5 + ... = O / 10 = 29130 / 10 = 2913.\\nAgain treat base 100 blocks:\\na_1 = W mod 100 = 2913 mod 100 = 13.\\nW1 = (W - a_1)/100 = (2913 - 13)/100 = 2900/100 = 29.\\nThen a_3 = W1 mod 100 = 29.\\nW2 = (W1 - a_3)/100 = (29 - 29)/100 = 0, so a_5, a_7, ... = 0.\\nSo a_1 = 13, a_3 = 29.\\n\\nThus the polynomial’s nonzero coefficients are:\\na_0 = 3,\\na_1 = 13,\\na_2 = 25,\\na_3 = 29,\\na_4 = 30,\\nall others = 0.\\n\\nThe problem asks to compute k = a_3 - 27, not P(1).\\nSo k = 29 - 27 = 2.\\nTherefore the answer to Problem 1 is 2.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have a right triangle with relatively prime integer side lengths. Let its legs be a, b and hypotenuse c, so a^2 + b^2 = c^2, and gcd(a, b, c) = 1 (primitive Pythagorean triple). The perimeter P = a + b + c, the area A = (1/2)ab. We want the largest possible integer value of P^2 / A.\\n\\nCompute P^2 / A:\\nA = ab/2, so P^2 / A = P^2 / (ab/2) = 2P^2 / (ab).\\nFor primitive Pythagorean triples, we use parameterization:\\na = m^2 - n^2,\\nb = 2mn,\\nc = m^2 + n^2,\\nwith integers m > n > 0, gcd(m, n) = 1, and one of m, n even, the other odd.\\nThen:\\nab = (m^2 - n^2)(2mn) = 2mn(m^2 - n^2).\\nP = a + b + c = (m^2 - n^2) + 2mn + (m^2 + n^2) = 2m^2 + 2mn = 2m(m + n).\\n\\nCompute P^2 and then P^2 / A:\\nP^2 = [2m(m+n)]^2 = 4m^2(m+n)^2.\\nA = (1/2)ab = (1/2) * 2mn(m^2 - n^2) = mn(m^2 - n^2).\\nSo:\\nP^2 / A = 4m^2(m+n)^2 / [mn(m^2 - n^2)] = 4m(m+n)^2 / [n(m^2 - n^2)].\\nWe need P^2/A to be integral and we want its largest possible integer value.\\n\\nSimplify expression:\\nR = P^2 / A = 4m(m+n)^2 / [n(m^2 - n^2)].\\nNote m^2 - n^2 = (m-n)(m+n).\\nSo:\\nR = 4m(m+n)^2 / [n(m-n)(m+n)] = 4m(m+n) / [n(m-n)].\\nThus:\\nR = 4m(m+n) / [n(m-n)].\\nWe need this to be an integer for allowed (m, n) and then find its maximum.\\n\\nLet’s analyze R = 4m(m+n) / [n(m-n)]. Because gcd(m, n) = 1, and m, n are of opposite parity, and m > n.\\nTo maximize R, for given m, as n approaches m from below, denominator n(m-n) becomes small, increasing R. But integrality constraints limit possibilities.\\n\\nWe will search algebraically over small n and derive conditions.\\n\\nWrite R = 4m(m+n) / [n(m-n)]. Let’s consider factoring 4 and looking for divisibility of denominator into numerator:\\nDenominator D = n(m-n).\\nWe need D | 4m(m+n).\\nSince gcd(m, n) = 1, note gcd(n, m) = 1, and gcd(n, m+n) = gcd(n, m) = 1, so n is coprime to both m and (m+n). Therefore n must divide 4. So n ∈ {1,2,4} (positive integer, and also need gcd(m, n) = 1, and m, n of opposite parity).\\n\\nCase 1: n = 1.\\nThen R = 4m(m+1) / (1*(m-1)) = 4m(m+1)/(m-1).\\nSimplify: perform polynomial division:\\n(m+1) = (m-1) + 2, so:\\nR = 4m[(m-1)+2]/(m-1) = 4m + 8m/(m-1).\\nSo R is integer iff (m-1) divides 8m.\\nBut gcd(m-1, m) = 1, so (m-1) must divide 8.\\nThus m-1 ∈ {1,2,4,8} ⇒ m ∈ {2,3,5,9}.\\nAlso, with n=1, m and n must have opposite parity and gcd(m,1)=1 is automatic. So m must be even (since n=1 is odd). Among {2,3,5,9}, even ones: m = 2 only.\\nSo only (m, n) = (2,1) in this case.\\nCompute R for (2,1):\\nR = 4m(m+n)/[n(m-n)] = 4*2*(2+1)/[1*(2-1)] = 8*3/1 = 24.\\nSo R = 24 for (3,4,5) triangle.\\n\\nCase 2: n = 2.\\nNeed gcd(m,2) = 1 (so m odd) and opposite parity holds automatically.\\nThen:\\nR = 4m(m+2) / [2(m-2)] = 2m(m+2)/(m-2).\\nRewrite m+2 = (m-2)+4, so:\\nR = 2m[(m-2)+4]/(m-2) = 2m + 8m/(m-2).\\nSo R integer iff (m-2) divides 8m.\\nBut gcd(m-2, m) = gcd(m-2,2) (since (m-2) - m = -2). For odd m, gcd(m-2,2) = 1 or 2. So gcd(m-2, m) ≤ 2.\\nThus (m-2) must divide 8m and be at most 16 (since any prime factor >2 cannot cancel with m; but more precisely, we enumerate divisors of 8m that are coprime to m/2 roughly; however, easier is to enforce (m-2)|(8m) plus gcd condition via direct patterns).\\nWe proceed systematically: since gcd(m-2,m) is 1 or 2, write 8m = (m-2)*k.\\nThen m-2 divides 8m and we care only that m is odd and >2.\\nBut we can also reason via 8m/(m-2) = 8 + 16/(m-2). (Since 8m = 8(m-2) + 16.)\\nThus R = 2m + 8 + 16/(m-2).\\nSo R integer iff (m-2) divides 16.\\nTherefore m-2 ∈ {1,2,4,8,16} ⇒ m ∈ {3,4,6,10,18}.\\nWe require m odd and gcd(m,2)=1, so m ∈ {3}. (4,6,10,18 are even.)\\nCheck m=3>n=2, okay.\\nCompute R for (m,n)=(3,2):\\nR = 4m(m+n)/[n(m-n)] = 4*3*(3+2)/[2*(3-2)] = 12*5/(2*1) = 60/2 = 30.\\nSo R = 30 for triangle (5,12,13).\\n\\nCase 3: n = 4.\\nNow gcd(m,4)=1 ⇒ m is odd and not divisible by 2; also opposite parity holds. So m odd and >4.\\nThen:\\nR = 4m(m+4)/[4(m-4)] = m(m+4)/(m-4).\\nWrite m+4 = (m-4)+8 ⇒\\nR = m[(m-4)+8]/(m-4) = m + 8m/(m-4).\\nSo R integer iff (m-4) divides 8m.\\nAs before, 8m = 8(m-4)+32 gives 8m/(m-4) = 8 + 32/(m-4).\\nThus (m-4) must divide 32.\\nSo m-4 ∈ {1,2,4,8,16,32} ⇒ m ∈ {5,6,8,12,20,36}.\\nWe require gcd(m,4)=1 and m odd, so m ∈ {5}. (6,8,12,20,36 are even.)\\nCheck m>n=4 holds.\\nCompute R for (m,n)=(5,4):\\nR = 4m(m+n)/[n(m-n)] = 4*5*(5+4)/[4*(5-4)] = 20*9/(4*1) = 180/4 = 45.\\nSo R = 45 for the triangle with (a,b,c) from (m,n)=(5,4), i.e. (m^2-n^2, 2mn, m^2+n^2) = (25-16=9, 2*5*4=40, 25+16=41), the (9,40,41) triangle.\\n\\nWe have exhausted n ∈ {1,2,4}. For n > 4, since n must divide 4, not possible. So these are all primitive triples for which P^2/A is integral.\\nThe integer values found: 24, 30, 45.\\nAmong them, the largest is 45.\\nTherefore the largest possible integral value of P^2/A is 45.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: 2\\nProblem 2: 45\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"45\"\n}",
