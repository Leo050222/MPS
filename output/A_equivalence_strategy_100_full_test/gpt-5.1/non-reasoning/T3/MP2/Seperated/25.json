We want the area of the region R ⊆ S where both components are at most 1, i.e.\\n3x + 2y ≤ 1,\\nx + 4y ≤ 1,\\nwith 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.\\n\\nWe solve the system to find the feasible polygon.\\nFrom 3x + 2y ≤ 1 ⇒ y ≤ (1 - 3x)/2.\\nFrom x + 4y ≤ 1 ⇒ y ≤ (1 - x)/4.\\nAlso y ≥ 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\\n\\nFind where the two lines intersect:\\n3x + 2y = 1\\nx + 4y = 1\\nFrom the second, x = 1 - 4y. Substitute into the first:\\n3(1 - 4y) + 2y = 1 ⇒ 3 - 12y + 2y = 1 ⇒ 3 - 10y = 1 ⇒ 10y = 2 ⇒ y = 1/5.\\nThen x = 1 - 4(1/5) = 1 - 4/5 = 1/5.\\nSo they intersect at (1/5, 1/5).\\n\\nCheck where each line meets the axes.\\nFor 3x + 2y = 1:\\n– On x-axis (y=0): 3x = 1 ⇒ x = 1/3.\\n– On y-axis (x=0): 2y = 1 ⇒ y = 1/2.\\nFor x + 4y = 1:\\n– On x-axis: x = 1.\\n– On y-axis: 4y = 1 ⇒ y = 1/4.\\n\\nNow find the region in the first quadrant under both lines within the unit square.\\nWe check bounds in x:\\nAt x=0, y ≤ 1/2 and y ≤ 1/4, so y≤1/4.\\nAt small positive x, need to compare (1 - 3x)/2 and (1 - x)/4:\\nCompute where (1 - 3x)/2 = (1 - x)/4:\\n4(1 - 3x) = 2(1 - x) ⇒ 4 - 12x = 2 - 2x ⇒ 2 = 10x ⇒ x = 1/5.\\nFor x<1/5, say x=0, (1 - 3x)/2 = 0.5 and (1 - x)/4 = 0.25, so the smaller upper bound is (1 - x)/4; for x>1/5, the smaller is (1 - 3x)/2.\\nAlso we require y ≥ 0, so each upper bound must be nonnegative:\\n(1 - x)/4 ≥ 0 ⇒ x ≤ 1.\\n(1 - 3x)/2 ≥ 0 ⇒ x ≤ 1/3.\\nThus the region R is:\\n0 ≤ x ≤ 1/5, 0 ≤ y ≤ (1 - x)/4,\\n1/5 ≤ x ≤ 1/3, 0 ≤ y ≤ (1 - 3x)/2.\\nThe upper bounds become 0 at x=1 and x=1/3, respectively, but the active inequality switches at x=1/5 and the second constraint cuts off beyond x=1/3, so the rightmost point is at x=1/3.\\nPoints at key intersections: (0,0), (0,1/4), (1/5,1/5), (1/3,0).\\nGeometrically R is a quadrilateral with those vertices, but easiest is the area via integration.\\n\\nCompute area(R):\\nA = ∫[0 to 1/5] (1 - x)/4 dx + ∫[1/5 to 1/3] (1 - 3x)/2 dx.\\nFirst integral:\\nI1 = (1/4) ∫[0 to 1/5] (1 - x) dx = (1/4) [x - x^2/2] from 0 to 1/5\\n= (1/4) (1/5 - 1/50) = (1/4) ((10 - 1)/50) = (1/4) * (9/50) = 9/200.\\nSecond integral:\\nI2 = (1/2) ∫[1/5 to 1/3] (1 - 3x) dx = (1/2) [x - (3/2)x^2] from 1/5 to 1/3.\\nCompute F(x) = x - (3/2)x^2.\\nF(1/3) = 1/3 - (3/2)*(1/9) = 1/3 - 1/6 = 1/6.\\nF(1/5) = 1/5 - (3/2)*(1/25) = 1/5 - 3/50 = 10/50 - 3/50 = 7/50.\\nSo F(1/3) - F(1/5) = 1/6 - 7/50.\\nLCM(6,50) = 150. 1/6 = 25/150, 7/50 = 21/150, so difference = 4/150 = 2/75.\\nThen I2 = (1/2)*(2/75) = 1/75.\\nThus area(R) = I1 + I2 = 9/200 + 1/75.\\nCommon denominator 600:\\n9/200 = 27/600,\\n1/75 = 8/600.\\nSo area(R) = 35/600 = 7/120.\\n\\nThe problem defines k = area(R) + 1553/120.\\nSo k = 7/120 + 1553/120 = (7 + 1553)/120 = 1560/120 = 13.\\nAnswer to Problem 1 is 13.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have a standard 52-card deck, and a 13-card hand. Point value: 4 per Ace, 3 per King, 2 per Queen, 1 per Jack. Given that the hand has exactly 4 honor cards (A,K,Q,J in total), find P(points ≥ 13 | exactly 4 honors).\\n\\nThere are 16 honors (4 each of A,K,Q,J) and 36 non-honors. Condition: the hand has exactly 4 honors and 9 non-honors.\\nTotal hands with exactly 4 honors: choose 4 honors out of 16, and 9 non-honors out of 36. So total_cond = C(16,4)*C(36,9).\\nGiven exactly 4 honors, the point value depends only on how many of those 4 are A,K,Q,J.\\nLet a,k,q,j be counts of A,K,Q,J in the 4 honors. Then\\na + k + q + j = 4,\\npoints = 4a + 3k + 2q + 1j.\\nWe need points ≥ 13.\\n\\nEnumerate all compositions (a,k,q,j) of 4 nonnegative integers summing to 4, compute the point total, and count how many 4-card honor subsets correspond to each pattern. The number of distinct 4-card subsets of honors realizing a given (a,k,q,j) is:\\nN(a,k,q,j) = C(4,a)*C(4,k)*C(4,q)*C(4,j), since there are 4 cards of each rank.\\n\\nTotal number of 4-honor subsets overall is C(16,4); we will find N_high = sum over patterns with points≥13 of N(a,k,q,j). Then desired probability is N_high / C(16,4), because the 9 non-honors are independent of the honor ranks and always contribute the same number of combinations C(36,9), which cancels in the conditional probability.\\n\\nList all a,k,q,j with a+k+q+j = 4.\\nWe compute points = 4a + 3k + 2q + j.\\nBecause j = 4 - a - k - q, we can express points as:\\npoints = 4a + 3k + 2q + (4 - a - k - q) = 3a + 2k + q + 4.\\nWe require 3a + 2k + q + 4 ≥ 13 ⇒ 3a + 2k + q ≥ 9.\\nBecause a,k,q,j are small, we enumerate directly.\\n\\nCase a = 4:\\nThen k=q=j=0.\\npoints = 16, ≥13. Pattern: (4,0,0,0). Count: C(4,4)C(4,0)C(4,0)C(4,0) = 1.\\n\\nCase a = 3:\\nThen k+q+j = 1 ⇒ possibilities:\\n(3,1,0,0): points = 12+3 = 15.\\n(3,0,1,0): 12+2 = 14.\\n(3,0,0,1): 12+1 = 13.\\nAll ≥13.\\nCounts:\\n(3,1,0,0): C(4,3)C(4,1)C(4,0)C(4,0) = 4*4=16.\\n(3,0,1,0): C(4,3)C(4,0)C(4,1)C(4,0) = 4*4=16.\\n(3,0,0,1): C(4,3)C(4,0)C(4,0)C(4,1) = 4*4=16.\\nSubtotal a=3: 48.\\n\\nCase a = 2:\\nThen k+q+j = 2.\\nPossibilities (k,q,j):\\n(2,0,0): pattern (2,2,0,0): points = 8+6=14.\\n(1,1,0): (2,1,1,0): 8+3+2=13.\\n(1,0,1): (2,1,0,1): 8+3+1=12 (<13), discard.\\n(0,2,0): (2,0,2,0): 8+4=12 (<13), discard.\\n(0,1,1): (2,0,1,1): 8+2+1=11, discard.\\n(0,0,2): (2,0,0,2): 8+2=10, discard.\\nSo only two patterns qualify: (2,2,0,0) and (2,1,1,0).\\nCounts:\\n(2,2,0,0): C(4,2)C(4,2)C(4,0)C(4,0) = 6*6=36.\\n(2,1,1,0): C(4,2)C(4,1)C(4,1)C(4,0) = 6*4*4 = 96.\\nSubtotal a=2: 36+96=132.\\n\\nCase a = 1:\\nThen k+q+j = 3.\\nEnumerate triples (k,q,j) with sum 3:\\n(3,0,0): (1,3,0,0): points = 4 + 9=13.\\n(2,1,0): (1,2,1,0): 4+6+2=12 (<13), discard.\\n(2,0,1): (1,2,0,1): 4+6+1=11, discard.\\n(1,2,0): (1,1,2,0): 4+3+4=11, discard.\\n(1,1,1): (1,1,1,1): 4+3+2+1=10, discard.\\n(1,0,2): (1,1,0,2): 4+3+2=9, discard.\\n(0,3,0): (1,0,3,0): 4+6=10, discard.\\n(0,2,1): (1,0,2,1): 4+4+1=9, discard.\\n(0,1,2): (1,0,1,2): 4+2+2=8, discard.\\n(0,0,3): (1,0,0,3): 4+3=7, discard.\\nSo only (1,3,0,0).\\nCount:\\nC(4,1)C(4,3)C(4,0)C(4,0) = 4*4=16.\\nSubtotal a=1: 16.\\n\\nCase a = 0:\\nThen k+q+j = 4; points = 3k + 2q + j.\\nList all (k,q,j) with sum 4 and require 3k+2q+j ≥13.\\nWe can use that j = 4 - k - q, so points = 3k + 2q + (4 - k - q) = 2k + q + 4, needing 2k + q ≥9.\\nMax of 2k+q arises at largest k and q. Since k+q ≤4, 2k+q ≤ 2k + (4-k) = k+4 ≤ 8 (because k≤4). So 2k+q ≤8, never reaches 9. So no patterns with a=0 qualify.\\n\\nSo valid patterns and counts:\\n(4,0,0,0): 1\\n(3,1,0,0):16\\n(3,0,1,0):16\\n(3,0,0,1):16\\n(2,2,0,0):36\\n(2,1,1,0):96\\n(1,3,0,0):16\\nTotal N_high = 1 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 36 + 96 + 16.\\nCompute: 1 + 16+16+16 = 49; 49+36=85; 85+96=181; 181+16=197.\\nSo N_high = 197.\\n\\nTotal 4-honor subsets = C(16,4).\\nCompute C(16,4) = 16*15*14*13 / (4*3*2*1).\\nFirst 16/4=4 → 4*15*14*13 / (3*2*1).\\nThen 15/3=5 → 4*5*14*13 /2.\\nThen 14/2=7 → 4*5*7*13 = 20*7*13 = 140*13 = 1820.\\nSo total = 1820.\\nThus\\nP(points ≥13 | exactly 4 honors) = N_high / C(16,4) = 197/1820.\\nWe can check for simplification: 197 is prime (not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11,13). 1820 = 2^2 *5 *7 *13. gcd(197,1820)=1. So fraction is already in lowest terms.\\nTherefore the answer to Problem 2 is 197/1820.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"13\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"197/1820\"\n}",
