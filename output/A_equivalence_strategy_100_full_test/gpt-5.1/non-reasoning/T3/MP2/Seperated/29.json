  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We start with the equation p/q - 4/(r+1) = 1, with p, q, r all primes. Rearranging: p/q = 1 + 4/(r+1) = (r+1+4)/(r+1) = (r+5)/(r+1). Hence p/q = (r+5)/(r+1). For equality of rational numbers in lowest terms, cross-multiply: p(r+1) = q(r+5). Since p and q are primes, we analyze gcd(p, q) = 1 or p=q. Case 1: p ≠ q. Then p divides r+5 and q divides r+1. Let r+5 = p and r+1 = q, so p - q = 4. Plugging r+5 = p and r+1 = q into p/q = (r+5)/(r+1) gives p/q = p/q, always true. Thus we just need primes p, q with p - q = 4. The only pair of primes differing by 4 and compatible with r being prime: r+1 = q ⇒ r = q-1, so r must be prime, and r+5 = p also prime. Therefore r, r+1, r+5 all prime. The only even prime is 2; among r, r+1, one must be even. If r is even and >2, not prime, so r could be 2. Then r=2 gives r+1=3, r+5=7, all prime: r=2, q=3, p=7. This satisfies the original equation: p/q - 4/(r+1) = 7/3 - 4/3 = 1. No other r works because r+1 being even >2 is not prime. Thus the unique solution triple is (p, q, r) = (7, 3, 2). The problem then says: instead of listing all primes, compute n = r + 2009, where r is the prime such that r+1 equals the denominator (they say numerator, but 4 is constant; from context, the relevant r is the one we just solved). Here r=2, so n = 2 + 2009 = 2011.\\n\\nProblem 2: FemtoPravis moves on an 8×8 toroidal chessboard, one step per femtosecond in a diagonal direction: NE = (1,1), NW = (-1,1), SE = (1,-1), SW = (-1,-1), each with probability 1/4. Coordinates are modulo 8. After 2012 steps, we want P(position = original). Denote position after t steps as (X_t, Y_t) in Z_8×Z_8, starting at (0,0). At each step, changes are ΔX ∈ {+1, -1} and ΔY ∈ {+1, -1}, with ΔX and ΔY independent and each equally likely ±1. Hence X_t and Y_t evolve independently, each as a 1D random walk modulo 8 with step ±1. Therefore P((X_t, Y_t)=(0,0)) = P(X_t=0)·P(Y_t=0) and P(X_t=0)=P(Y_t=0) by symmetry. So we need P_1D(t):=P(X_t ≡ 0 mod 8), then the answer is P_1D(t)^2 with t=2012.\\nFor the 1D walk: X_0=0, and X_t = sum_{i=1}^t ξ_i mod 8, where ξ_i are iid with P(ξ_i=1)=P(ξ_i=-1)=1/2. This is the simple symmetric ±1 walk on Z_8. Its transition kernel has eigenvalues λ_k = (1/2)(e^{2πik/8} + e^{-2πik/8}) = cos(2πk/8) for k=0,...,7. The probability of being at 0 at time t given start 0 is P_1D(t) = (1/8) ∑_{k=0}^7 λ_k^t = (1/8) ∑_{k=0}^7 cos^t(2πk/8). Compute cos(2πk/8) for k=0,...,7: cos(0)=1; cos(π/4)=√2/2; cos(π/2)=0; cos(3π/4)=-√2/2; cos(π)=-1; cos(5π/4)=cos(π+π/4)=-√2/2; cos(3π/2)=0; cos(7π/4)=√2/2. Grouping terms: P_1D(t) = (1/8)[1^t + (-1)^t + 2·(√2/2)^t + 2·(-√2/2)^t + 2·0^t]. For t ≥ 1, 0^t=0. For even t, (-1)^t=1 and (-√2/2)^t = ( (√2/2)^t ) since the sign vanishes. Thus for even t: P_1D(t) = (1/8)[1+1 + 2·a + 2·a] where a=(√2/2)^t. So P_1D(t) = (1/8)(2 + 4a) = (1/4) + (1/2)a. For odd t, (-1)^t=-1 and 0^t=0, so P_1D(t) = (1/8)[1-1 + 2a - 2a]=0, consistent with parity (sum of odd number of ±1 cannot be 0 mod 2, hence not 0 mod 8). Here t=2012 is even, so we use P_1D(2012)=(1/4)+(1/2)(√2/2)^{2012}. Note (√2/2)^{2012} = (2^{-1/2})^{2012} = 2^{-1006}. Hence P_1D(2012) = 1/4 + 1/(2·2^{1006}) = 1/4 + 1/2^{1007}. Then P(return to origin in 2D) = [P_1D(2012)]^2 = (1/4 + 1/2^{1007})^2. Expand: (1/4)^2 = 1/16; cross term 2·(1/4)(1/2^{1007}) = 1/(2^{1008}); last term (1/2^{1007})^2 = 1/2^{2014}. So the final probability is 1/16 + 1/2^{1008} + 1/2^{2014}. One can also leave it factored as (1/4 + 1/2^{1007})^2; both are exact.\\n\\nThus the answers are: Problem 1: 2011. Problem 2: (1/4 + 1/2^{1007})^2, equivalently 1/16 + 1/2^{1008} + 1/2^{2014}.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"2011\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"(1/4+1/2^1007)^2\"\n}",
