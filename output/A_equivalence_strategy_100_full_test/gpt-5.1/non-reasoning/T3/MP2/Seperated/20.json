  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We solve m^5 - n^5 = 16mn over integers and look for a solution where m and n have opposite signs, with n > 0, then set k = n - 1.\\nRewrite n = -t with t > 0 to encode opposite signs assuming m > 0, n < 0. Then the equation becomes m^5 + t^5 = -16 m t. But the left side is positive while the right side is non-positive, impossible unless m = 0 or t = 0. If m = 0, then -n^5 = 0 so n = 0 (same sign, both zero). If n = 0, then m^5 = 0 so m = 0. Thus there is no nontrivial solution with opposite signs in that orientation.\\nCheck the other orientation: take m < 0, n > 0. Let m = -u with u > 0. Then (-u)^5 - n^5 = -u^5 - n^5 = 16(-u)n = -16 u n. Multiply by -1 to get u^5 + n^5 = 16 u n. Now both sides are nonnegative. Write u^5 + n^5 in factorized form: u^5 + n^5 = (u + n)(u^4 - u^3 n + u^2 n^2 - u n^3 + n^4). Since u, n > 0, we have (u + n)(u^4 - u^3 n + u^2 n^2 - u n^3 + n^4) = 16 u n.\\nWe can try small positive integer pairs (u, n) since 16 u n is small when u, n are small, and the factor (u + n) must divide 16 u n. Test systematically:\\n(u, n) = (1,1): LHS = 1 + 1 = 2, RHS = 16*1*1 = 16, no.\\n(1,2): LHS = 1 + 32 = 33, RHS = 32, no.\\n(1,3): 1 + 243 = 244 vs 48, no.\\n(2,1): 32 + 1 = 33 vs 32, no.\\n(2,2): 32 + 32 = 64 vs 64, yes. So u = 2, n = 2 works.\\nCheck explicitly in original variables: m = -u = -2, n = 2. Then m^5 - n^5 = (-32) - 32 = -64, and 16 m n = 16 * (-2)*2 = -64, so this pair satisfies the equation and has opposite signs with n positive. There may be other solutions, but we only need the n from such a pair. Here n = 2, so k = n - 1 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: The polynomial x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48 has positive roots p < q < r. Then by Viète,\\n1) p + q + r = a\\n2) pq + pr + qr = b\\n3) p q r = 48.\\nWe want to minimize S = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r.\\nWrite S in terms of p, q, r: S = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r.\\nThis is a constrained optimization problem under p, q, r > 0, p < q < r, and pqr = 48. The coefficients a and b are not otherwise constrained, so only the product condition and positivity/ordering matter.\\nWe expect the minimum occurs at some boundary of the ordering constraint or from symmetry-like considerations. Because p, q, r are just ordered versions of three positive roots with fixed product, any minimum over all positive triples with fixed product can then be checked against distinctness and ordering after. So first minimize S over all positive p, q, r with pqr = 48 (no ordering restriction), then pick the permutation that meets p < q < r.\\nIntroduce Lagrange multiplier λ for constraint p q r = 48. We minimize f(p, q, r) = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r subject to g(p, q, r) = ln p + ln q + ln r - ln 48 = 0 (equivalent constraint).\\nSet up ∇f = μ ∇g:\\n∂f/∂p = -1/p^2, ∂g/∂p = 1/p → -1/p^2 = μ(1/p) → -1/p = μ.\\n∂f/∂q = -2/q^2, ∂g/∂q = 1/q → -2/q^2 = μ(1/q) → -2/q = μ.\\n∂f/∂r = -3/r^2, ∂g/∂r = 1/r → -3/r^2 = μ(1/r) → -3/r = μ.\\nThus we require -1/p = -2/q = -3/r = μ. That gives 1/p : 2/q : 3/r all equal, so:\\n1/p = 2/q → q = 2 p.\\n2/q = 3/r → r = (3/2) q = 3 p.\\nSo the critical point has (p, q, r) proportional to (1, 2, 3). With the product constraint p q r = 48, we get p * 2p * 3p = 6 p^3 = 48 → p^3 = 8 → p = 2, q = 4, r = 6. These are positive and strictly increasing, so p < q < r holds.\\nCompute S at this point: S = 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/6 = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3/2.\\nWe now argue this is indeed the minimum: the Lagrange multiplier method finds interior extrema on the positive orthant subject to p q r = 48. The feasible set { (p, q, r) > 0 : pqr = 48 } is smooth and extends to infinity and toward zero in each coordinate. As any variable tends to 0+ or ∞ while holding product constant, at least one term in 1/p + 2/q + 3/r blows up, so S → ∞ near the boundary. Therefore any finite critical value must be a global minimum for S on this domain. Since the only critical point corresponds to (2,4,6), that value 3/2 is the global minimum. The ordering requirement p < q < r is already satisfied, so the minimum possible value of 1/p + 2/q + 3/r is 3/2.\\n\\nThus: Problem 1 gives k = 1, and Problem 2 gives 3/2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"3/2\"\n}",
