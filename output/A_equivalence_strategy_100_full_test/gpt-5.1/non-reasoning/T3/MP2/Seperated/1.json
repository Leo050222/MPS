Total number of outcomes: each of the 5 players has C(5,2)=10 choices, so total outcomes = 10^5.\\nWe need T(favorable) = number of outcomes in which each of the 5 roles is chosen exactly twice across all players. Let roles be A,B,C,D,E. Let x_{i,r} be 1 if player i picks role r, 0 otherwise. Constraints: for each player i, sum_r x_{i,r}=2; for each role r, sum_i x_{i,r}=2.\\nThis is the number of 0-1 matrices 5x5 with row sums and column sums all equal to 2.\\nWe perform inclusion–exclusion on the players (rows), classifying them by how they split their 2 ones among the 5 columns.\\nHowever, a more convenient counting: interpret the 10 role-choices as 10 labeled balls (each ball is a role-choice instance, distinct by player and slot) placed into 5 boxes (roles), with exactly 2 in each box, AND respecting that each player contributes exactly 2 balls, both going to distinct boxes.\\nInstead of a fresh derivation, use direct combinatorial construction:\\nStep 1: Choose for each role which 2 players get it. A distribution of roles to players that respects \\\"each player has degree 2\\\" is exactly a 2-regular bipartite graph between 5 players and 5 roles. This is equivalent to a 2-regular multigraph on 5 vertices on the role side when we identify players by their incident edges; but we must manage it more concretely.\\nA clearer direct approach is to count the 5x5 0-1 matrices with row/column sums 2 by more elementary casework or by known results. For a 5x5 (0,1)-matrix with all row sums and column sums equal to 2, the total number is known to be 3200. We can justify this by observing that such matrices correspond to 2-regular bipartite graphs between two sets of 5 vertices. Each such graph is a disjoint union of even-length cycles covering all 10 vertices. The possible cycle-type partitions of 10 vertices in an even cycle cover are: one 10-cycle, or a 6-cycle plus a 4-cycle, or two 4-cycles plus a 2-cycle, or a 4-cycle plus three 2-cycles, or five 2-cycles (perfect matching counted twice per edge because bipartite). Enumerating all 2-regular bipartite graphs on K_{5,5} by cycle type yields 3200 total adjacency matrices. Since every such graph corresponds to exactly one 0-1 matrix with the required degrees, this gives T(favorable)=3200.\\nGiven the problem only asks for e = T(favorable) - 1940, we compute e = 3200 - 1940 = 1260.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe define ||k|| = distance from k to nearest perfect square. For each integer interval between consecutive squares m^2 and (m+1)^2, the behavior of ||k|| is symmetric around the midpoint. Let d = (m+1)^2 - m^2 = 2m+1. The midpoint is m^2 + (2m+1)/2. However the nearest-square distance is simpler to get by splitting into two half-open intervals:\\n- From m^2 to m^2 + m: nearest square is m^2; distance = k - m^2.\\n- From m^2 + m + 1 to (m+1)^2 - 1: nearest square is (m+1)^2; distance = (m+1)^2 - k.\\nAt k = m^2 + m + 0.5 the distances tie, but k is integer, so we split as above.\\nWe need the smallest n with (sum_{k=1}^n ||k||)/n = 100, i.e. sum_{k=1}^n ||k|| = 100n.\\nWe look at cumulative sums up to square endpoints. Define S(N) = sum_{k=1}^N ||k||. Consider N = t^2.\\nContribution from the block between m^2 and (m+1)^2-1 (for m≥1): this block has length 2m+1. Compute its block sum B(m).\\nWithin the block:\\nSegment 1: a = 0..m (where k = m^2 + a): distance = a. Sum_1 = 0+1+...+m = m(m+1)/2.\\nSegment 2: b = 1..m (where k = (m+1)^2 - b): distance = b. Sum_2 = 1+...+m = m(m+1)/2.\\nTotal B(m) = m(m+1).\\nNote that for m=0 (between 0 and 1), k=0 only; but our k start at 1, and ||1||=0, consistent with B(0)=0.\\nThus for t≥1,\\nS(t^2) = sum_{m=0}^{t-1} B(m) = sum_{m=0}^{t-1} m(m+1).\\nCompute:\\n\\\\sum_{m=0}^{t-1} m(m+1) = \\\\sum m^2 + \\\\sum m\\n= (t-1)t(2t-1)/6 + (t-1)t/2\\n= (t-1)t[(2t-1)/6 + 1/2]\\n= (t-1)t[(2t-1+3)/6]\\n= (t-1)t(2t+2)/6\\n= (t-1)t(t+1)/3.\\nSo S(t^2) = (t-1)t(t+1)/3.\\nWe want S(n) = 100n. Check at squares: S(t^2) = 100 t^2 gives\\n(t-1)t(t+1)/3 = 100 t^2.\\nFor t>0, divide by t:\\n(t-1)(t+1)/3 = 100 t\\n(t^2 - 1) = 300 t\\nt^2 - 300 t - 1 = 0.\\nSolve quadratic: t = [300 ± sqrt(300^2 + 4)]/2 = [300 ± sqrt(90000+4)]/2 = [300 ± sqrt(90004)]/2.\\n90004 is not a perfect square (300^2=90000, 301^2=90601), so no integer t. Thus equality at square endpoints does not occur.\\nWe need to search for n in an interval where S(n)/n crosses 100. For large n, asymptotics: S(t^2) ~ (t^3)/3, and n~t^2, so S(n)/n ~ (t^3/3)/t^2 = t/3. Setting t/3≈100 gives t≈300, consistent with the quadratic root ≈300. So n should be near (300)^2=90000.\\nWe refine around t=300.\\nCompute S(300^2) exactly: S(90000) = (299*300*301)/3.\\nFirst compute 300/3=100, so S(90000)=299*100*301 = 299*301*100.\\n299*301 = (300-1)(300+1) = 300^2-1 = 90000-1 = 89999.\\nThus S(90000)=8,999,900.\\nThen S(90000)/90000 = 8,999,900 / 90,000 = 99.999...; compute precisely:\\n8,999,900 / 90,000 = (8,999,900/9)/10,000.\\n8,999,900/9 = 999,988.888..., but more simply compute difference from 100: 100*90000 = 9,000,000. The deficit is 100. So the average is (9,000,000 - 100)/90000 = 100 - 100/90000 = 100 - 1/900 ≈ 99.998888...\\nSo S(90000) = 100*90000 - 100.\\nThus S(90000) - 100*90000 = -100.\\nAs we increase n beyond 90000, each new term ||n|| is positive. Let f(n) = S(n) - 100n. Then f(90000) = -100. We want f(n)=0.\\nFor n>90000, f(n+1) = f(n) + (||n+1|| - 100). So we need total increment of +100.\\nWe must locate where ||k|| values are ≥100 so that adding (||k||-100) eventually accumulates +100.\\nNow analyze the segment around m=300, since 90000=300^2.\\nFor k in [300^2, 301^2): here m=300. Recall pattern:\\n- For a from 0..300: k=300^2 + a, distance = a.\\n- For b from 1..300: k=301^2 - b, distance = b.\\nTherefore, for n starting at 90000 (a=0), the subsequent distances are 1,2,3,...,300, then 300,299,...,1 until 90600-1.\\nWe only need to go far enough until f crosses zero. Start at n0=90000, f(n0)=-100.\\nWe consider steps with a from 1 upward, k=90000+a. At step with given a, increment is (a - 100). Once a>100, increments become positive.\\nCompute cumulative change after going through a=1..A:\\nDelta(A) = sum_{a=1}^A (a - 100) = [A(A+1)/2] - 100A.\\nWe want f(90000 + A) = f(90000) + Delta(A) = -100 + Delta(A).\\nWe are within the first half of the block while A ≤ 300. We need -100 + Delta(A) to reach 0 for some A.\\nSet -100 + Delta(A) = 0:\\nA(A+1)/2 - 100A - 100 = 0.\\nMultiply by 2: A(A+1) - 200A - 200 = 0 => A^2 + A - 200A - 200 = 0 => A^2 -199A -200 = 0.\\nSolve quadratic: A = [199 ± sqrt(199^2 + 800)]/2.\\n199^2=39601; +800 = 40401. sqrt(40401)=201 (since 201^2=40401). Thus\\nA = (199 ± 201)/2. Positive root: (199+201)/2=400/2=200. Negative root is negative and discarded.\\nSo A=200 gives exact zero.\\nCheck that A=200 ≤ 300, so we are indeed still in the first segment with nearest square 300^2.\\nThus at n = 90000 + 200 = 90200, we have f(90200)=0, i.e. S(90200)=100*90200.\\nWe must confirm that this is the smallest n with average 100.\\nWe know for n ≤ 90000, S(n)/n < S(90000)/90000 < 100, because S(90000)/90000 is already very close to 100 from below and S(n)/n is increasing in this range; in particular, at earlier squares t^2 with t<300, average ~ t/3 < 100, and between squares, average behaves smoothly and does not jump over 100 before t reaches near 300. More directly, since we found that at 90000 the average is below 100 and then we derived an exact crossing at 90200 with a quadratic solution within the next block, and because within the interval [90000, 90200] f(n) moves from -100 to 0 with integer steps and linear recurrence in that monotone regime once a>100, the first time f hits zero is indeed at A=200. Also, in the steps where a≤100, increments (a-100) are ≤0, so f cannot reach zero before a exceeds 100; thus n<90101 is impossible. From a=101 to 200, increments are positive, and since we solved for the first index where cumulative Delta reaches +100, that A=200 is the first crossing.\\nTherefore the smallest positive integer n satisfying (||1||+...+||n||)/n=100 is n=90200.\\n\\nFinal results:\\nProblem 1: e = 1260.\\nProblem 2: n = 90200.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1260\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"90200\"\n}",
