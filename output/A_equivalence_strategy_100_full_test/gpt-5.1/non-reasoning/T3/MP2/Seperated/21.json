That means x and y are either both even or both odd.\\n- If x and y are both even, then x^n and y^n are divisible by 2^n, so their difference is divisible by 2^n. Since 2^100 has only the factor 2, we must have 2^n | 2^100, which is always true when n ≤ 100, but this does not immediately rule out even/even. However, we must check concrete structure.\\n- If x and y are both odd, then x^n ≡ 1 (mod 2) and y^n ≡ 1 (mod 2), so x^n - y^n is even, which is fine.\\nWe thus cannot rule out parity solely on this basis. We need a finer factorization.\\n\\nStep 2: Use factorization x^n - y^n = (x - y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + ... + y^{n-1}).\\nLet\\n  A = x - y,\\n  B = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + ... + y^{n-1}.\\nThen A, B are positive integers and\\n  A * B = 2^100.\\nBecause 2^100 has only prime factor 2, both A and B must be powers of 2:\\n  A = 2^a,\\n  B = 2^{100 - a}\\nfor some integer a with 0 ≤ a ≤ 100.\\nThus x and y must be such that x - y = 2^a and B has the given form.\\n\\nStep 3: Consider the gcd structure for n odd vs n even.\\nIt is classical that\\n  gcd(x - y, x^{n-1} + ... + y^{n-1}) =\\n    1, if n is odd,\\n    gcd(x - y, n), if n is even\\nfor integers x, y. A simpler and crucial fact we can use here:\\n- If n is odd, then the two factors (x - y) and B are coprime.\\n- If n is even, then gcd(x - y, B) can be greater than 1.\\n\\nHowever, in our equation, both A and B are powers of 2. That is, they are not coprime unless one of them equals 1. This gives strong restrictions when n is odd.\\n\\nStep 4: Analyze the case n odd.\\nIf n is odd, gcd(A, B) = 1. But A = 2^a and B = 2^{100 - a}. The gcd of these is 2^{min(a, 100 - a)}, which is 1 only if min(a, 100 - a) = 0.\\nThus either a = 0 or 100 - a = 0.\\nCase (i): a = 0.\\n  Then A = x - y = 1 and B = 2^100.\\nCase (ii): 100 - a = 0 → a = 100.\\n  Then B = 1 and A = 2^100, so x - y = 2^100.\\nWe must test each possibility for existence of integer solutions.\\n\\nStep 4a: n odd and x - y = 1, B = 2^100.\\nLet y = t, x = t + 1 with t ∈ Z_{>0}. Then\\n  B = (t + 1)^{n-1} + (t + 1)^{n-2} t + ... + t^{n-1}.\\nThis sum is strictly increasing in t for fixed n ≥ 2. For t = 1 and n = 3 (the smallest odd n > 1), we get\\n  B = 2^2 + 2*1 + 1^2 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\\nThis is already far smaller than 2^100, but more importantly, we need B to be a pure power of 2. There is a known result: if x - y = 1 and n is odd > 1, then x^n - y^n = 1^n + ... is never a power of 2 for n ≥ 3 except trivial small cases, but we can argue more structurally via parity and mod reasoning.\\nMore directly: when x and y are consecutive integers, plugging small n shows the growth; insisting that B = 2^100 is extremely restrictive. Yet we must be certain there is no such solution across all odd n.\\nA stronger structural argument: write\\n  B = n y^{n-1} + higher order terms in x - y,\\nso for large y, B is roughly n y^{n-1}, which cannot be a power of 2 unless y itself is a power of 2 and n is compatible. However, x - y = 1 implies x and y are consecutive; at least one of them is odd, so one of x^n, y^n is odd and the other is even when n is odd, making their difference odd, but 2^100 is even. This is decisive:\\nIf n is odd and x - y = 1, then x and y have opposite parity, so x^n and y^n have opposite parity, hence x^n - y^n is odd. That contradicts x^n - y^n = 2^100 (even). So no solutions in this subcase.\\n\\nStep 4b: n odd and B = 1, A = 2^100.\\nWe have\\n  B = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} y + ... + y^{n-1} = 1.\\nBut each term is a positive integer, and there are n terms (n ≥ 3 for odd n > 1). Therefore B ≥ n ≥ 3. It cannot equal 1. So this subcase has no solutions.\\nThus, there are no solutions for n odd.\\n\\nStep 5: Analyze the case n even.\\nLet n = 2m with m ≥ 1 and m ≠ 0; since n > 1, we have m ≥ 1, and n = 2, 4, 6, ....\\nRewrite the equation as\\n  x^{2m} - y^{2m} = (x^m - y^m)(x^m + y^m) = 2^100.\\nSo both (x^m - y^m) and (x^m + y^m) are powers of 2, say\\n  x^m - y^m = 2^u,\\n  x^m + y^m = 2^v,\\nwith u, v ≥ 0 and\\n  2^u * 2^v = 2^{u+v} = 2^100 → u + v = 100.\\nFrom the second equation we get x^m = (2^u + 2^v)/2 and y^m = (2^v - 2^u)/2.\\nThese must be positive integers.\\nFirstly, 2^v > 2^u since x^m, y^m > 0 implies x^m - y^m > 0, so u < v. Thus v ≥ 1 and u ≥ 0 with u < v and u + v = 100.\\nWe also note that x^m and y^m must be integers, so (2^u + 2^v)/2 and (2^v - 2^u)/2 must be integers, which they are because 2^u and 2^v are even when u, v ≥ 1.\\nBut we also need y^m ≥ 1, so 2^v - 2^u ≥ 2, which implies 2^u (2^{v - u} - 1) ≥ 2. Since v > u, 2^{v - u} - 1 ≥ 1, so minimal is when u = 0, v = 100, giving 2^0(2^{100} - 1) = 2^{100} - 1 ≥ 1. For y^m to be at least 1, 2^v - 2^u ≥ 2, which holds except possibly the smallest exponent differences but we will pin this down next.\\nHowever, we need x and y integers, not just x^m and y^m. So x^m and y^m must both be perfect m-th powers.\\nObserve that x^m + y^m and x^m - y^m are both powers of 2. Consider parity: x^m and y^m must have same parity. If one is odd, the other is odd, then x^m + y^m is even but not a power of 2 beyond 2 (since sum of two positive odd numbers is at least 2 and divisible by 2 but not by 4 unless each is ≡ 1 mod 4, and even then you get 2 mod 4, not pure power-of-2 structure for all but small cases). It is more straightforward to pursue the following stronger decomposition.\\nNote that when n = 2m, we can also write x = 2^r a, y = 2^r b with gcd(a, b) = 1 and at least one of a, b odd. Then\\n  x^n - y^n = 2^{rn}(a^n - b^n) = 2^100.\\nSince a^n - b^n is an integer, this yields\\n  a^n - b^n = 2^{100 - rn}.\\nBut gcd(a, b) = 1 implies gcd(a^n - b^n, a b) = 1, so a^n - b^n is odd unless a and b are both odd, which they must be since gcd(a, b) = 1 and at least one is odd. For a and b both odd, a^n ≡ 1 (mod 2), b^n ≡ 1 (mod 2), so a^n - b^n is even. Contradiction with our statement that gcd(a^n - b^n, ab) = 1 giving odd, so refine: the standard property is gcd(a - b, a^n - b^n) = gcd(a - b, n). This does not directly give parity constraints on a^n - b^n.\\nInstead, use LTE (lifting-the-exponent) for prime 2.\\nLet x and y be both odd or both even combined with v_2(x^n - y^n).\\nSubcase: x and y both odd.\\nThen apply LTE for odd x, y:\\n  v_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2(x - y) + v_2(n),\\nsince x, y odd and n even or odd as required. Here n is even (n > 1), so we apply this formula with p = 2 and n even:\\nFor odd x, y and even n,\\n  v_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2(x - y) + v_2(x + y) + v_2(n) - 1.\\nWe require this valuation to be 100. This is possible in principle. However, x^n - y^n = 2^100 means x^n ≡ y^n (mod 4) except that the difference is a pure power of 2. Carefully analyzing all possibilities is messy but we can seek structural contradictions.\\nA more systematic approach is to constrain n first.\\n\\nStep 6: Bound n using size comparisons.\\nConsider n ≥ 3.\\nFor n ≥ 3 and any positive integers x > y, the factorization\\n  x^n - y^n = (x - y)(x^{n-1} + ... + y^{n-1})\\nhas at least:\\n  x - y ≥ 1,\\n  x^{n-1} + ... + y^{n-1} ≥ x^{n-1} ≥ 2^{n-1} if x ≥ 2.\\nThus x^n - y^n ≥ 2^{n-1}, so the exponent of 2 in x^n - y^n is at least n - 1 in crude size terms. But we need exactly 2^100, so n - 1 ≤ 100, which is not restrictive.\\nThis size comparison is too weak on its own. Instead, notice that 2^100 is not very large in terms of n: if n is large and x, y not too close, the difference grows quickly and its factorization in powers of 2 gets intricate.\\nHowever, there is a known classification result: if x^n - y^n is a pure power of 2 for n > 2, there are no solutions except trivial cases with small exponents. While we cannot quote the theorem, we can emulate the reasoning for this particular exponent.\\n\\nStep 7: Reduce to n = 2 by structure of powers of 2.\\nConsider n even ≥ 4. Then n = 2m with m ≥ 2, and we have\\n  x^{2m} - y^{2m} = (x^m - y^m)(x^m + y^m).\\nBoth factors are positive integers with the same parity as x^m and y^m. Furthermore, if x and y are both even, then each factor is divisible by at least 2^m, and if both are odd, each factor is odd or even depending on m. The net result is we get two factors whose values and 2-adic valuations must partition 100.\\nWe can attempt to find integer solutions with n ≥ 4 by considering the smallest possible x and y.\\nTry y = 1.\\nThen x^{2m} - 1 = 2^100.\\nFor m ≥ 2, x^4 - 1 factors as (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1), both positive and > 1, so x^4 - 1 cannot be a pure power of 2, since 2^k factorization into numbers > 1 implies that each factor itself is a power of 2, but x^2 + 1 > x^2 - 1 and they differ by 2, and two powers of 2 differing by 2 are only (2, 4) giving product 8, not large enough. For higher m, you get even more factors.\\nMore generally, for n ≥ 3, x^n - y^n has at least two or more nontrivial factors besides powers of 2 if x and y are not very special.\\nTo make progress cleanly, observe a simpler and decisive step: examine the possibility n = 2 separately and then show there are no solutions for n ≥ 3 using a congruence argument.\\n\\nStep 8: Case n = 2.\\nWe solve\\n  x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) = 2^100.\\nLet\\n  x - y = 2^a,\\n  x + y = 2^b,\\nwith 0 ≤ a ≤ b and a + b = 100.\\nSolving for x and y:\\n  x = ( (x + y) + (x - y) ) / 2 = (2^b + 2^a) / 2 = 2^{a-1}(2^{b - a} + 1),\\n  y = ( (x + y) - (x - y) ) / 2 = (2^b - 2^a) / 2 = 2^{a-1}(2^{b - a} - 1).\\nWe need x, y positive integers. For y to be positive, we need 2^{b - a} - 1 ≥ 1, hence b - a ≥ 1, so b > a.\\nWe also need x and y integers:\\n- If a ≥ 1, then 2^{a-1} is an integer and all good.\\n- If a = 0, then x = (2^b + 1)/2 and y = (2^b - 1)/2, which are integers because 2^b is even. However, in that case, a + b = 100 implies b = 100.\\nCheck a = 0, b = 100:\\n  x = (2^{100} + 1)/2,\\n  y = (2^{100} - 1)/2.\\nThese are positive integers and indeed satisfy x^2 - y^2 = 2^{100}.\\nSo both a = 0 and a ≥ 1 with b > a and a + b = 100 give integer solutions.\\nConstraints: a, b integers with\\n  0 ≤ a < b,\\n  a + b = 100.\\nHow many such pairs (a, b) exist?\\nFrom a + b = 100 and b > a, we have 2a < 100 → a ≤ 49. Also a ≥ 0. For each a with 0 ≤ a ≤ 49, b = 100 - a is uniquely determined and satisfies b > a.\\nThus there are 50 valid pairs (a, b), each giving a distinct pair (x, y). So for n = 2, there are 50 ordered pairs (x, y) satisfying x^2 - y^2 = 2^100.\\nEach such pair corresponds to one ordered triple (x, y, 2).\\nSo at least 50 solutions come from n = 2.\\n\\nStep 9: Show there are no solutions for n ≥ 3.\\nWe must now argue that for integers x, y > 0 and n ≥ 3, the equation x^n - y^n = 2^100 has no solutions.\\nConsider n ≥ 3 and suppose a solution exists.\\nFirst, x and y cannot be both even: if x = 2x1, y = 2y1, then\\n  x^n - y^n = 2^n(x1^n - y1^n) = 2^100 → x1^n - y1^n = 2^{100 - n}.\\nWe can divide repeatedly by 2^n as long as x and y remain even. Eventually we get a pair (X, Y) where at least one is odd while still satisfying\\n  X^n - Y^n = 2^k,\\nfor some k ≥ 0. So wlog we may assume x and y are not both even.\\nIf one of x, y is even and the other odd, then x^n and y^n have opposite parity for any n, hence x^n - y^n is odd, contradicting that it equals 2^100 (even). So x and y must both be odd in any nontrivial solution.\\nThus we may assume x and y are odd for a solution with n ≥ 3.\\nApply LTE for p = 2, odd x, y, and n ≥ 1:\\n- If n odd: v_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2(x - y) + v_2(n).\\n- If n even: v_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2(x - y) + v_2(x + y) + v_2(n) - 1.\\nSince we are now in the case n ≥ 3, handle n odd and even.\\n\\nCase A: n odd ≥ 3.\\nWe already treated n odd in Step 4 using the factorization a*b = 2^100 and gcd(a, b) = 1, leading to no solutions. That argument did not require any restriction on parity of x, y beyond the parity contradiction for x - y = 1, and the B = 1 subcase impossible. Thus there are no solutions for n odd.\\n\\nCase B: n even ≥ 4.\\nThen x, y odd and we use the second LTE formula:\\n  v_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2(x - y) + v_2(x + y) + v_2(n) - 1.\\nLet\\n  a = v_2(x - y),\\n  b = v_2(x + y),\\n  c = v_2(n).\\nSince x, y odd, x - y and x + y are even, so a ≥ 1, b ≥ 1.\\nBecause n ≥ 4 and even, we have c ≥ 2 (since n is divisible by 4 or at least 2; but n could be 2 mod 4 giving c = 1; we need to allow c ≥ 1 actually). More precisely, for n even, c ≥ 1; for n multiple of 4, c ≥ 2.\\nAnyway, a ≥ 1, b ≥ 1, c ≥ 1.\\nThen\\n  v_2(x^n - y^n) = a + b + c - 1 ≥ 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 2.\\nThis just tells us it is at least 2, not helpful yet. We need that it equals 100.\\nSo we require\\n  a + b + c - 1 = 100 → a + b + c = 101.\\nNow, a and b are valuations of x - y and x + y, and x - y and x + y are both even. Moreover, x + y > x - y > 0.\\nThere is a standard relationship:\\n  v_2(x + y) = v_2(x - y) + v_2(x + y) - v_2( (x + y) - (x - y) ) = something,\\nbut more directly, since x and y are odd, x - y ≡ 0 (mod 2) but ≡ 0 or 2 mod 4 depending. However, the key point is that x - y and x + y have the same parity and share at most limited powers of 2.\\nIn fact, for odd x, y we have:\\n  v_2(x - y) ≥ 1,\\n  v_2(x + y) = 1,\\nor vice versa? Let's check small examples:\\n- If x = 5, y = 1: x - y = 4 (v_2 = 2), x + y = 6 (v_2 = 1).\\n- If x = 7, y = 1: x - y = 6 (v_2 = 1), x + y = 8 (v_2 = 3).\\nIn general, for odd x, y, either x ≡ y (mod 4) or x ≡ -y (mod 4). When x ≡ y (mod 4), x - y ≡ 0 (mod 4), so v_2(x - y) ≥ 2, but x + y ≡ 2 (mod 4), so v_2(x + y) = 1. When x ≡ -y (mod 4), x + y ≡ 0 (mod 4) and x - y ≡ 2 (mod 4), giving v_2(x + y) ≥ 2 and v_2(x - y) = 1.\\nThus for odd x, y, one of a, b equals 1, and the other is some integer ≥ 1. So\\n  min(a, b) = 1,\\n  max(a, b) ≥ 1.\\nHence\\n  a + b = 1 + d,\\nfor some integer d ≥ 1. Thus a + b ≥ 2.\\nWe require a + b + c = 101, with c = v_2(n) ≥ 1. So we need\\n  1 + d + c = 101 → d + c = 100.\\nBut d = max(a, b) ≥ 1 and c ≥ 1. Many combinations are possible. This does not yet forbid solutions.\\nHowever, note that x - y and x + y multiply to x^2 - y^2. We are not directly controlling that; instead, we need x^n - y^n = 2^100, not x^2 - y^2.\\nA more direct approach: try n = 4 as smallest even ≥ 4 and see structure.\\nEquation becomes:\\n  x^4 - y^4 = (x^2 - y^2)(x^2 + y^2) = 2^100.\\nEach factor must be a power of 2. However, x^2 + y^2 > x^2 - y^2 > 0.\\nLet\\n  x^2 - y^2 = 2^r,\\n  x^2 + y^2 = 2^s,\\nwith r + s = 100.\\nThen similarly we have\\n  x^2 = (2^s + 2^r)/2,\\n  y^2 = (2^s - 2^r)/2.\\nAs before, r < s.\\nWrite s - r = k ≥ 1. Then\\n  x^2 = 2^{r-1}(2^k + 1),\\n  y^2 = 2^{r-1}(2^k - 1).\\nBecause x, y are integers, 2^k ± 1 must be perfect squares times a power of 2, but since 2^k ± 1 are odd, they must themselves be odd squares. So we need integers u, v such that\\n  2^k + 1 = u^2,\\n  2^k - 1 = v^2,\\nand x^2 = 2^{r-1}u^2, y^2 = 2^{r-1}v^2.\\nBut 2^k + 1 - (2^k - 1) = 2 = u^2 - v^2 = (u - v)(u + v).\\nThe only factorization of 2 into positive integers is (1, 2), so\\n  u - v = 1,\\n  u + v = 2,\\ngiving u = 3/2, v = 1/2, not integers. Thus there is no solution for n = 4.\\nA similar argument extends for higher even n by grouping factors into x^{2m} - y^{2m} = (x^m - y^m)(x^m + y^m). Each factor must be a power of 2 and leads to the same kind of Pell-type system for 2^k ± 1. It is known that the only integer solutions of 2^k + 1 = u^2 occur for k small (k = 3 gives 9 = 3^2). But 2^3 - 1 = 7 is not a square, so 2^k ± 1 cannot simultaneously be squares.\\nThus no solutions exist for n ≥ 4.\\nCombined with the earlier elimination for n odd, the only possible exponent is n = 2.\\n\\nStep 10: Count total solutions.\\nFrom Step 8, for n = 2, there are exactly 50 ordered pairs (x, y) of positive integers with x^2 - y^2 = 2^100. For any n ≠ 2 (n > 1), there are no solutions.\\nThus the total number of ordered triples (x, y, n) is 50, all with n = 2.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\n- Problem 1: k = 1.\\n- Problem 2: The number of ordered triples (x, y, n) is 50.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"50\"\n}",
