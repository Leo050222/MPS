      "A1054": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $e = N - 86$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nThere are 8 different antigens. Each student’s blood type is some distinct subset of these 8 antigens, so there are 2^8 = 256 distinct subsets, matching the 256 students. Thus each possible subset appears exactly once.\\nWe are told to find e = N - 86, where N is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen. By symmetry among the 8 antigens, each antigen appears in exactly half of the 2^8 subsets: for any fixed antigen, there are 2^7 subsets containing it (each choice of the other 7 antigens). So N = 2^7 = 128. Hence e = 128 - 86 = 42.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nLet James’s integers be a, b, c. Alex’s procedure: pick two numbers, average them, then add that average to the third. The three possible results are given as 42, 13, and 37.\\nThe three expressions (depending on which pair is averaged) are:\\nR1 = (a + b)/2 + c,\\nR2 = (a + c)/2 + b,\\nR3 = (b + c)/2 + a.\\nTo simplify, multiply each by 2:\\n2R1 = a + b + 2c,\\n2R2 = a + c + 2b,\\n2R3 = b + c + 2a.\\nLet R1, R2, R3 be some ordering of {42, 13, 37}. Then S = 2R1 + 2R2 + 2R3 = (a + b + 2c) + (a + c + 2b) + (b + c + 2a).\\nCompute in terms of a, b, c:\\nS = (a + a + 2a) + (b + 2b + b) + (2c + c + c) = 4a + 4b + 4c = 4(a + b + c).\\nThus a + b + c = S/4. But S = 2(42 + 13 + 37) = 2 * 92 = 184, so a + b + c = 184/4 = 46.\\nNow we only need to assign each outcome to one of R1, R2, R3. For any specific assignment, we can solve for a, b, c and see whether it yields integers. Note that each of a, b, c is an integer, so each R must be an integer. Also, from the formulas we can recover a, b, c as follows:\\nAdd the equations for 2R2 and 2R3:\\n2R2 = a + c + 2b,\\n2R3 = b + c + 2a.\\nAdding: 2R2 + 2R3 = (a + 2a) + (2b + b) + (c + c) = 3a + 3b + 2c.\\nBut we know a + b + c = 46, so c = 46 - a - b. Substitute:\\n3a + 3b + 2c = 3a + 3b + 2(46 - a - b) = 3a + 3b + 92 - 2a - 2b = a + b + 92.\\nThus 2R2 + 2R3 = a + b + 92, so a + b = 2R2 + 2R3 - 92. Then c = 46 - (a + b).\\nHowever, a easier way is to pick an assignment, solve directly, and ensure integer values. Notice that the sum a + b + c = 46 must be consistent across all assignments; so for each assignment, we can derive a, b, c using linear elimination.\\nLet’s test an assignment: set R1 = 42, R2 = 13, R3 = 37.\\nThen 2R1 = 84, 2R2 = 26, 2R3 = 74.\\nWe have:\\n(1) a + b + 2c = 84,\\n(2) a + c + 2b = 26,\\n(3) b + c + 2a = 74,\\nand \\n(4) a + b + c = 46.\\nWe can check consistency quickly using (4). Subtract (4) from (1): (a + b + 2c) - (a + b + c) = c = 84 - 46 = 38, so c = 38.\\nThen from (4): a + b = 46 - 38 = 8.\\nUse (2): a + c + 2b = 26 => a + 38 + 2b = 26 => a + 2b = -12. But a + b = 8, so subtract: (a + 2b) - (a + b) = b = -12 - 8 = -20. Thus b = -20, and a = 8 - b = 8 - (-20) = 28. Check (3): b + c + 2a = -20 + 38 + 56 = 74, which matches 2R3 = 74. So this assignment is consistent and yields integers.\\nTherefore one valid triple of integers is (a, b, c) = (28, -20, 38), up to order. We should also verify that the three actual results that Alex can get from these integers are indeed 42, 13, and 37 (in some order):\\nAverage a and b, add c:\\n(a + b)/2 + c = (28 + (-20))/2 + 38 = 8/2 + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42.\\nAverage a and c, add b:\\n(a + c)/2 + b = (28 + 38)/2 + (-20) = 66/2 - 20 = 33 - 20 = 13.\\nAverage b and c, add a:\\n(b + c)/2 + a = (-20 + 38)/2 + 28 = 18/2 + 28 = 9 + 28 = 37.\\nThus this triple exactly produces the required possible results. The three integers James wrote are 28, -20, and 38.\\n\\nFinal answers: e = 42 for Problem 1, and the integers 28, -20, 38 for Problem 2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"42\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"28, -20, 38\"\n}",
