  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe are given S(n)(S(n)−1) = n−1, where S(n) is the sum of digits of n. Let s = S(n). Then n = s(s−1)+1.\\nWe need n to have digit sum s, i.e., S(s(s−1)+1) = s, and we want the smallest positive integer n satisfying this.\\n\\nFirst, try small s and compute n:\\n- s=1: n = 1·0+1 = 1, S(1)=1. Works.\\n- s=2: n = 2·1+1 = 3, S(3)=3≠2.\\n- s=3: n = 3·2+1 = 7, S(7)=7≠3.\\n- s=4: n = 4·3+1 = 13, S(13)=4, so this also works.\\nBut we only need the smallest positive n, which is n=1 from s=1. The problem asks for k = S(n) + 4. For n=1, S(n)=1, so k = 1+4 = 5.\\nSo answer to Problem 1 is 5.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have a unit cube (side length 1) and choose 5 of its 8 vertices. We seek the maximum possible volume of the convex hull of these 5 points.\\nInterpretation: \\\"the figure whose vertices are the 5 chosen points\\\" in such geometry problems is the convex polyhedron with those vertices. So we want the maximal volume of the convex hull of any 5 vertices of the cube.\\n\\nGeneral reasoning:\\n- The full cube has volume 1.\\n- Any 5 vertices form some polyhedron with volume ≤1.\\n- Clearly, taking all 8 vertices gives volume 1, but we are restricted to 5.\\nWe need to consider the combinatorics of selecting 5 vertices.\\n\\nLabel cube vertices as (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(1,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1).\\nA known approach: volume of convex hull of a subset of vertices can be seen as the cube minus the union of convex hulls of the omitted vertices, but with only 5 chosen, 3 vertices are omitted and the hull is typically a polyhedron that is the cube minus 3 corner tetrahedra or more complicated pieces.\\nWe want a configuration of 5 vertices that keeps as much of the cube as possible.\\n\\nHeuristic and structural analysis:\\n- If the 5 vertices include a face of 4 vertices plus 1 additional vertex somewhere, the hull often equals a pyramid over that face or a larger chunk of the cube.\\n- If we miss three vertices that are all on the same face, that face is gone, which tends to reduce volume significantly.\\nA strong candidate is to omit three vertices that are mutually non-adjacent enough that the removed regions are relatively small.\\n\\nConcrete candidate configuration:\\nConsider choosing all 4 vertices of the bottom face z=0: (0,0,0),(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(1,1,0), plus the top far corner (1,1,1). Call these A=(0,0,0), B=(1,0,0), C=(0,1,0), D=(1,1,0), E=(1,1,1).\\nThe convex hull of these 5 points is a pyramid with base the square ABCD and apex E. Base area = 1 (unit square), height is the perpendicular distance from E to the plane z=0, which is 1. So volume = (1/3)*Area(base)*height = (1/3)*1*1 = 1/3.\\nSo 1/3 is achievable.\\n\\nWe must check if a larger volume than 1/3 is possible.\\nAny polyhedron with 5 vertices in 3D is either:\\n- a 4-vertex polyhedron plus one interior vertex (but vertices of the cube are all extreme points of the cube, so any chosen vertex is an extreme point of the hull, so the hull's set of vertices is exactly that 5-point set), or\\n- a 5-vertex polyhedron. A convex polyhedron with 5 vertices is either a pyramid with a quadrilateral base (4+1) or a triangular prism (6 vertices) or other combinations; with 5 vertices, typical shape is a quadrilateral pyramid.\\nThus, for 5 vertices taken as vertices of the convex hull, we most often get a quadrilateral pyramid. Any such pyramid has volume (1/3)*area(base)*height.\\nWe therefore search for a quadrilateral base of large area with an apex at large height relative to its plane. Since vertices lie in {0,1}^3, any quadruple of vertices is coplanar only if it forms a face or some other plane; candidate maximum base area occurs when the base is a face of the cube (area 1). The maximum possible distance from an opposite vertex to the plane of that face is 1 (for the parallel opposite face).\\nHence the maximum pyramid volume achievable with cube vertices is (1/3)*1*1 = 1/3.\\nCould we get a shape that isn’t just a single pyramid and has larger volume? With exactly 5 vertices, the polyhedron cannot be a union of two disjoint tetrahedra giving more volume than 1/3 unless the base area and/or height surpass that bound. But as noted, base area ≤1 and height ≤1 for any such decomposition within the cube.\\nMore formally, any convex polyhedron with vertices among the cube's vertices and containing at most one full face cannot occupy more volume than the pyramid over that face with an opposite apex at distance 1. Any other configuration either:\\n- has a smaller base area (e.g., a quadrilateral lying diagonally across the cube has area ≤1), or\\n- has smaller height relative to that base plane.\\nTrying other typical selections:\\n- Four coplanar vertices in a vertical rectangle and one opposite corner lead to base area ≤1 and height ≤1.\\n- Non-coplanar quadruples as base: then the count of vertices vs. facets does not align with a different structure yielding larger volume; the maximal determinant from three edges with coordinates in {0,1} has absolute value 1, giving maximum tetrahedron volume 1/6, and any decomposition of the polyhedron into tetrahedra keeps the total ≤1/3 when restricted by the cube's size.\\nThus 1/3 is the maximum possible volume.\\nTherefore, the answer to Problem 2 is 1/3.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\n- Problem 1: 5\\n- Problem 2: 1/3\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1/3\"\n}",
