      "A401": "Trevor and Edward play a game in which they take turns adding or removing beans from a pile. On each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. The player who empties the pile wins. For example, if Trevor goes first with a pile of 5 beans, he can either add 4 to make the total 9, or remove 4 to make the total 1, and either way Edward wins by removing all the beans. There is no limit to how large the pile can grow; it just starts with some finite number of beans in it, say fewer than 1000. Before the game begins, Edward dispatches a spy to find out how many beans will be in the opening pile, call this $n$, then \"graciously\" offers to let Trevor go first. Knowing that the first player is more likely to win, but not knowing $n$, Trevor logically but unwisely accepts, and Edward goes on to win the game. Find a number $n$ less than 1000 that would prompt this scenario, assuming both players are perfect logicians. A correct answer is worth the nearest integer to $\\log _{2}(n-4)$ points. Instead of finding an initial pile size $n$ less than 1000 that is a losing position for the first player under perfect play, simply find $k = s(p) - 6$, where $p$ is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example, and $s(p)$ is the largest perfect square at most $p$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe are told Trevor starts with a pile of 5 beans. On his turn, he must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. For n = 5, the largest perfect square ≤ 5 is 4. Thus the legal moves from 5 are:\\n- Add 4, making the pile size 5 + 4 = 9.\\n- Remove 4, making the pile size 5 - 4 = 1.\\n\\nThe problem text says: “For example, if Trevor goes first with a pile of 5 beans, he can either add 4 to make the total 9, or remove 4 to make the total 1, and either way Edward wins by removing all the beans.” So after Trevor’s first move, Edward eventually wins regardless.\\n\\nIn the reformulated task we are asked: “Instead of finding an initial pile size n less than 1000 that is a losing position for the first player under perfect play, simply find k = s(p) - 6, where p is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example, and s(p) is the largest perfect square at most p.”\\n\\nIn the example, the initial pile is 5. We consider the move where we add the largest perfect square ≤ 5 to the pile. That square is 4, so\\np = 5 + 4 = 9.\\nNow s(p) is defined as the largest perfect square ≤ p. For p = 9, the largest perfect square ≤ 9 is 9 itself. Thus\\ns(p) = 9.\\nThen\\nk = s(p) - 6 = 9 - 6 = 3.\\nSo the answer to Problem 1 is 3.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have a tetrahedron (4 vertices). Each vertex is colored red, blue, or green. We must count colorings up to rotational symmetry (the rotation group of a tetrahedron has 12 elements), with the restriction that no face has all three vertices the same color — i.e., each triangular face must not be monochromatic.\\n\\nUse Burnside’s Lemma. Let the rotation group G have |G| = 12. For each rotation g in G, let Fix(g) be the number of colorings that are unchanged by g and also satisfy the condition that no face is monochromatic. The desired count is (1/|G|) * sum_{g in G} Fix(g).\\n\\nThe rotational symmetries of a regular tetrahedron:\\n- Identity: 1 element.\\n- 120° and 240° rotations about an axis through a vertex and the center of the opposite face: 8 elements (for each of 4 vertices, there are two nontrivial rotations).\\n- 180° rotations about an axis through midpoints of opposite edges: 3 elements.\\nTotal 1 + 8 + 3 = 12.\\n\\nLabel the tetrahedron vertices 1, 2, 3, 4. The faces are {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,3,4}, and {2,3,4}. We have 3 colors; denote C = {R, B, G}.\\n\\n1) Identity rotation:\\nEvery coloring is fixed by the identity. First count unconstrained colorings: 3^4 = 81.\\nWe must subtract colorings where some face is monochromatic. Let a face be monochromatic if all three vertices of that face have the same color.\\n\\nDefine events:\\nA_123: face {1,2,3} monochromatic\\nA_124: face {1,2,4} monochromatic\\nA_134: face {1,3,4} monochromatic\\nA_234: face {2,3,4} monochromatic\\nWe want the number of colorings with no monochromatic face: 81 minus |A_123 ∪ A_124 ∪ A_134 ∪ A_234|.\\n\\nCompute |A_face| for a single face:\\nTake face {1,2,3} monochromatic. All 3 vertices must be same color (3 ways), vertex 4 free (3 ways). So |A_123| = 3*3 = 9.\\nBy symmetry, each |A_i| = 9.\\n\\nNow intersections of two different A's:\\n- A_123 ∩ A_124: vertices 1,2,3 same color; vertices 1,2,4 same color. This forces vertices 1,2,3,4 all the same color (3 choices). So |A_123 ∩ A_124| = 3.\\n- Similarly, any pair of faces that share an edge force all four vertices to the same color, so their intersection has size 3.\\nEvery pair of distinct faces in a tetrahedron shares an edge, so for any distinct i, j, |A_i ∩ A_j| = 3.\\nThere are C(4,2) = 6 such pairs.\\n\\nTriple intersections:\\nA_123 ∩ A_124 ∩ A_134: again forces all four vertices same color; same for any triple of faces. So |A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k| = 3. There are C(4,3) = 4 triples.\\n\\nIntersection of all four faces:\\nA_123 ∩ A_124 ∩ A_134 ∩ A_234 again forces all 4 vertices same color: 3 colorings.\\n\\nApply inclusion-exclusion:\\n|A_123 ∪ A_124 ∪ A_134 ∪ A_234|\\n= sum |A_i| - sum |A_i ∩ A_j| + sum |A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k| - |A_123 ∩ A_124 ∩ A_134 ∩ A_234|\\n= 4*9 - 6*3 + 4*3 - 3\\n= 36 - 18 + 12 - 3\\n= 27.\\nTherefore, colorings with no monochromatic face:\\nFix(identity) = 81 - 27 = 54.\\n\\n2) 120°/240° rotations about a vertex-face axis (8 elements total):\\nConsider rotation around axis through vertex 1 and opposite face {2,3,4}. This rotation cycles vertices 2,3,4 and fixes vertex 1.\\nFor a coloring to be fixed by such a rotation, vertices 2,3,4 must all be the same color, say x, and vertex 1 can be any color, say y. So unconstrained fixed colorings under this rotation: 3 choices for x, 3 for y, total 9.\\nNow impose the “no monochromatic face” condition.\\nFaces:\\n- {1,2,3}\\n- {1,2,4}\\n- {1,3,4}\\n- {2,3,4}\\nGiven vertices 2,3,4 all color x, the face {2,3,4} is monochromatic. That already violates the condition. So no coloring fixed by this rotation avoids monochromatic faces.\\nHence Fix(g) = 0 for any nontrivial 120° or 240° rotation about a vertex-face axis.\\nThus for the 8 such rotations, each contributes 0.\\n\\n3) 180° rotations about an axis through midpoints of opposite edges (3 elements):\\nConsider the rotation that swaps vertices 1 ↔ 2 and 3 ↔ 4. For a coloring to be fixed by this rotation, we must have the same color on each swapped pair: c1 = c2, c3 = c4. So there are 3 choices for c1/c2 and 3 for c3/c4, total 9 colorings invariant under this rotation, before constraints.\\nNow check whether any such invariant coloring can satisfy the no-monochromatic-face condition.\\nLet a = color of vertices 1 and 2.\\nLet b = color of vertices 3 and 4.\\nFaces:\\n- {1,2,3}: colors (a, a, b). This face is monochromatic exactly when a = b.\\n- {1,2,4}: (a, a, b).\\n- {1,3,4}: (a, b, b).\\n- {2,3,4}: (a, b, b).\\nSo if a = b, then all four vertices same color; all faces monochromatic, forbidden.\\nIf a ≠ b, then any face has colors of form (a, a, b) or (a, b, b). Neither is monochromatic, so they are allowed.\\nSo admissible configurations fixed by this 180° rotation require a ≠ b.\\nNumber of such colorings: choose a in 3 ways, choose b in 2 ways (≠ a), total 3*2 = 6.\\nThus Fix(g) = 6 for this 180° rotation.\\nBy symmetry, each of the 3 edge-midpoint 180° rotations has Fix = 6.\\n\\n4) Burnside’s Lemma:\\nSum of fixed colorings over all group elements:\\n- Identity: 54\\n- 8 rotations by 120°/240°: 8 * 0 = 0\\n- 3 rotations by 180°: 3 * 6 = 18\\nTotal sum = 54 + 0 + 18 = 72.\\nDivide by |G| = 12:\\nNumber of distinct colorings = 72 / 12 = 6.\\n\\nThus the final answers are: Problem 1 → 3, Problem 2 → 6.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
