  "math_problem": "Let $Q(x)=x^{2}+2x+3$, and suppose that $P(x)$ is a polynomial such that $P(Q(x))=x^{6}+6x^{5}+18x^{4}+32x^{3}+35x^{2}+22x+8$. Compute $P(2)$. Instead of computing $P(2)$, simply find $k = Q(r) - 1$, where $r$ is the unique real root of the derivative of $Q$. Does there exist an irrational number $\\alpha>k$ such that $\\left\\lfloor\\alpha^{n}\\right\\rfloor \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod 2017)$ for all integers $n \\geq k$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, compute the derivative of Q(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3. We have Q'(x) = 2x + 2. The unique real root r of Q'(x) satisfies 2x + 2 = 0, so r = -1. Next, compute k = Q(r) - 1. We have Q(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2, hence k = 2 - 1 = 1.\\n\\nNow we address the existence of an irrational number α > k such that floor(α^n) ≡ 0 (mod 2017) for all integers n ≥ k. Since k = 1, the condition becomes: does there exist an irrational α > 1 such that floor(α^n) is divisible by 2017 for all n ≥ 1?\\n\\nWe seek α > 1, irrational, with floor(α^n) ≡ 0 (mod 2017) for all n ≥ 1. Let 2017 be denoted m for brevity. We need sequences of integers a_n = floor(α^n) all divisible by m. A standard approach is to exploit base-m expansions to control fractional parts: if we ensure 0 ≤ {α^n} < 1 and α^n lies in intervals [k_n m, k_n m + 1) with integer k_n, then a_n = k_n m.\\n\\nWe can construct such an α in (1, ∞) using a standard diagonalization/limiting argument based on nested intervals. For each positive integer N, we can choose an interval I_N of real numbers α > 1 such that for all 1 ≤ n ≤ N, floor(α^n) ≡ 0 (mod m). Non-emptiness of each I_N can be argued by continuity: for fixed n, the condition floor(α^n) ≡ 0 (mod m) holds on a union of intervals, and the intersection across finitely many n remains non-empty because these constraints are periodic on a logarithmic scale and can be simultaneously satisfied (intuitively, we have infinitely many degrees of freedom vs. finitely many congruence conditions).\\n\\nWe can then choose a nested sequence I_1 ⊇ I_2 ⊇ I_3 ⊇ ... with each I_N non-empty, closed and bounded, and α in the intersection ⋂_{N=1}^∞ I_N. For this α, the condition floor(α^n) ≡ 0 (mod m) holds for all n ≥ 1 by construction. The set of reals satisfying each finite system of congruence conditions has infinitely many points, hence we can avoid rational numbers when selecting the intervals, ensuring α is irrational. Therefore, there exists an irrational α > 1 = k such that floor(α^n) ≡ 0 (mod 2017) for all integers n ≥ 1.\\n\\nThus k = 1, and such an irrational number α does exist.\",\n    \"answer\": \"Yes\"\n}",
