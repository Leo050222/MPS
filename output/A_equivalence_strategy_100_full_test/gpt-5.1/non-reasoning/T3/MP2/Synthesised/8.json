  "math_problem": "Find two lines of symmetry of the graph of the function $y=x+\\frac{1}{x}$. Express your answer as two equations of the form $y=a x+b$. Instead of determining the equations of the lines of symmetry, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote parallel to the y-axis, derived from the asymptotic analysis of the curve. Determine all triplets of real numbers $(x, y, z)$ satisfying the system of equations $x^{2} y+y^{2} z =k+1039$, $x^{2} z+z^{2} y =260$, $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) =-540$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"We are asked about y = x + 1/x. Its asymptotes are x = 0 and y = x. The one parallel to the y-axis is x = 0, whose coefficient-vector (for ax + by + c = 0) is (1, 0). Its Euclidean norm is k = sqrt(1^2 + 0^2) = 1. The given system is then:\\n1) x^2 y + y^2 z = 1 + 1039 = 1040\\n2) x^2 z + z^2 y = 260\\n3) (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) = -540\\nFirst observe x, y, z are all nonzero: from (1) and (2), if any variable is zero, you quickly contradict the equations. Let S1 = x + y + z, S2 = xy + yz + zx, S3 = xyz. Also denote A = x^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 x and B = x^2 z + z^2 y + y^2 x. Note that our equations (1) and (2) only include part of A and B:\\nA1 = x^2 y + y^2 z = 1040\\nB1 = x^2 z + z^2 y = 260\\nThen A = A1 + z^2 x = 1040 + z^2 x and B = B1 + y^2 x = 260 + x y^2.\\nThere are symmetric identities involving (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) in terms of S1, S2, S3, but they are quite nonlinear and incorporating the asymmetric A1, B1 makes a direct symmetric approach unwieldy. Instead, attempt to solve the system over reals with integer or simple rational candidates using the structure of the third equation.\\nThe factor (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) = -540 suggests integer differences. Look for integer triples (x, y, z) with distinct entries whose pairwise differences multiply to -540. We systematically test combinations where differences have factors of 540 such as (1, 3, 180), (2, 3, 90), (2, 5, 54), etc., but need actual values consistent with the polynomial equations of (1) and (2). It turns out that the system has real solutions that satisfy these three equations only for a very specific configuration that strongly constrains x, y, z.\\nA more direct algebraic route: from (1) and (2) divide each by y z (nonzero) in suitable ways:\\n(1) x^2 y + y^2 z = y(x^2 + y z) = 1040\\n(2) x^2 z + z^2 y = z(x^2 + y z) = 260\\nIf x^2 + y z = 0, then left sides become 0, contradicting 1040 and 260. So x^2 + y z ≠ 0. Then dividing (1) and (2),\\n y(x^2 + y z) / [z(x^2 + y z)] = 1040 / 260 = 4\\nso y / z = 4, hence y = 4 z.\\nPlugging back into (2): x^2 z + z^2 y = x^2 z + z^2(4 z) = x^2 z + 4 z^3 = 260. Assuming z ≠ 0 (true), divide by z:\\n x^2 + 4 z^2 = 260 / z.\\nSimilarly from (1): x^2 y + y^2 z = y(x^2 + y z) = 1040. With y = 4 z,\\n 4 z (x^2 + 4 z^2) = 1040 → z(x^2 + 4 z^2) = 260.\\nBut we already have x^2 + 4 z^2 = 260 / z from the rearranged (2), so this is consistent (it just reproduces itself), giving no new restriction besides y = 4 z. Hence variables must satisfy y = 4 z.\\nNow, enforce (3): (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) = -540. Substitute y = 4 z:\\n(x - 4 z)(4 z - z)(z - x) = -540 → (x - 4 z)(3 z)(z - x) = -540.\\nNote (z - x) = -(x - z), so the product becomes\\n3 z (x - 4 z)(z - x) = 3 z [-(x - 4 z)(x - z)] = -3 z (x - 4 z)(x - z) = -540.\\nMultiply both sides by -1:\\n3 z (x - 4 z)(x - z) = 540.\\nThis is one equation in x, z. Also recall x^2 + 4 z^2 = 260 / z from earlier; multiply by z:\\n z x^2 + 4 z^3 = 260.\\nSet t = x for convenience; we have system:\\n(1a) z t^2 + 4 z^3 = 260\\n(3a) 3 z (t - 4 z)(t - z) = 540.\\nAssume z ≠ 0. Divide (3a) by 3 z:\\n (t - 4 z)(t - z) = 540 / (3 z) = 180 / z.\\nExpand left:\\n t^2 - 5 z t + 4 z^2 = 180 / z,\\nor\\n t^2 - 5 z t + 4 z^2 - 180 / z = 0.\\nFrom (1a): t^2 = (260 - 4 z^3) / z. Sub into the previous:\\n (260 - 4 z^3)/z - 5 z t + 4 z^2 - 180 / z = 0.\\nCombine the terms with 1/z:\\n[(260 - 4 z^3) - 180]/z - 5 z t + 4 z^2 = 0 → (80 - 4 z^3)/z - 5 z t + 4 z^2 = 0.\\nMultiply through by z:\\n80 - 4 z^3 - 5 z^2 t + 4 z^3 = 0 → 80 - 5 z^2 t = 0,\\nso\\n t = 80 / (5 z^2) = 16 / z^2.\\nThus x = 16 / z^2, y = 4 z. Plug back into (1a):\\n z x^2 + 4 z^3 = 260 → z (16 / z^2)^2 + 4 z^3 = 260.\\nCompute x^2: (16 / z^2)^2 = 256 / z^4, so\\n z * (256 / z^4) + 4 z^3 = 260 → 256 / z^3 + 4 z^3 = 260.\\nMultiply by z^3:\\n256 + 4 z^6 = 260 z^3.\\nLet u = z^3. Then the equation is\\n4 u^2 - 260 u + 256 = 0.\\nDivide by 4:\\n u^2 - 65 u + 64 = 0.\\nSolve this quadratic:\\n Discriminant Δ = 65^2 - 4 * 1 * 64 = 4225 - 256 = 3969 = 63^2.\\nSo\\n u = [65 ± 63]/2 → u1 = (65 + 63)/2 = 128/2 = 64, u2 = (65 - 63)/2 = 2/2 = 1.\\nRecall u = z^3:\\nCase 1: z^3 = 64 → z = 4 (real cube root).\\nCase 2: z^3 = 1 → z = 1.\\nNow find corresponding x and y:\\nRecall x = 16 / z^2 and y = 4 z.\\nCase 1: z = 4 → x = 16 / 16 = 1, y = 4 * 4 = 16. Check distinct: (1, 16, 4) distinct, good. Verify all original equations:\\n1) x^2 y + y^2 z = 1^2*16 + 16^2*4 = 16 + 256*4 = 16 + 1024 = 1040 ✔\\n2) x^2 z + z^2 y = 1^2*4 + 4^2*16 = 4 + 16*16 = 4 + 256 = 260 ✔\\n3) (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) = (1 - 16)(16 - 4)(4 - 1) = (-15)*(12)*(3) = -540 ✔\\nSo (x, y, z) = (1, 16, 4) is a solution.\\nCase 2: z = 1 → x = 16 / 1 = 16, y = 4 * 1 = 4. Check:\\n1) 16^2*4 + 4^2*1 = 256*4 + 16 = 1024 + 16 = 1040 ✔\\n2) 16^2*1 + 1^2*4 = 256 + 4 = 260 ✔\\n3) (16 - 4)(4 - 1)(1 - 16) = 12*3*(-15) = -540 ✔\\nSo (x, y, z) = (16, 4, 1) is also a solution.\\nWe must check if any other solution arises, but all assumptions (nonzero, divisions, and the step that led to y/z = 4) were logically forced by equations (1) and (2). The derivation that x^2 + y z ≠ 0 was necessary and correct: if x^2 + y z = 0, then x^2 y + y^2 z = y(x^2 + y z) = 0 contradicts 1040. Thus y/z = 4 is mandatory. Also z ≠ 0 was enforced from the start. So all real solutions are captured by solving for z via the quadratic in u, giving only z^3 = 64 or 1, hence exactly two real triples.\\nTherefore, k = 1, and all real triplets (x, y, z) satisfying the system are (1, 16, 4) and (16, 4, 1).\",\n    \"answer\": \"(1,16,4);(16,4,1)\"\n}",
