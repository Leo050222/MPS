  "math_problem": "A point $(x, y)$ is selected uniformly at random from the unit square $S=\\{(x, y) \\mid 0 \\leq x \\leq 1,0 \\leq y \\leq 1\\}$. If the probability that $(3x+2y, x+4y)$ is in $S$ is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a+b$. Instead of computing the numerical identifier from the fractional probability that the transformed point remains within the unit square, simply find $k=$ area$(R) + 1553/120$, where area$(R)$ is the measure of the subset of the unit square on which both components of the linear transformation are at most 1. In bridge, a standard 52-card deck is dealt in the usual way to 4 players. By convention, each hand is assigned a number of \"points\" based on the formula $$4 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~A} \\text {'s })+3 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~K} \\text {'s })+2 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{Q} \\text {'s })+1 \\times(\\# \\mathrm{~J} \\text {'s })$$ Given that a particular hand has exactly 4 cards that are A, K, Q, or J, find the probability that its point value is $k$ or higher.",

All such 4-card subsets are equally likely (given the condition). The remaining 9 cards are among the 36 low cards and do not affect the high-card point total. Thus we only need to look at the multiset of 4 high cards from the 16 total.\\n\\nPoint values per card: A=4, K=3, Q=2, J=1.\\nIn each suit there are A,K,Q,J, so 4 high cards per suit and 16 total high cards.\\nBut for the point total, card identity matters only via rank, not suit. However, the deck has 4 copies of each rank (one per suit).\\nThus among the 16 high cards:\\n- 4 Aces, each 4 points\\n- 4 Kings, each 3 points\\n- 4 Queens, each 2 points\\n- 4 Jacks, each 1 point.\\nWhen we choose 4 high cards, each specific card is distinct, but the distribution of ranks determines the total points.\\n\\nWe need P(total points ≥ 13 | exactly 4 high cards) = (number of 4-card selections from the 16 high cards with point total ≥ 13) / C(16,4).\\n\\nLet a,k,q,j be the counts of A,K,Q,J in the 4 chosen cards.\\nConstraints: a+k+q+j=4, with each variable integer ≥0 and ≤4.\\nPoint total P = 4a + 3k + 2q + j.\\nWe need P ≥ 13.\\n\\nWe count combinations with repetition limits due to at most 4 of each rank.\\nFor a fixed quadruple (a,k,q,j), the number of distinct 4-card hands realizing that rank pattern is:\\nC(4,a) * C(4,k) * C(4,q) * C(4,j)\\n(choosing suits for each rank from 4 available per rank).\\n\\nWe systematically enumerate all (a,k,q,j) with a+k+q+j=4 and 4a+3k+2q+j ≥ 13.\\nNote j = 4 − a − k − q.\\nSo total points as a function of a,k,q is:\\nP(a,k,q) = 4a + 3k + 2q + (4 − a − k − q) = 3a + 2k + q + 4.\\nThus condition P ≥ 13 becomes:\\n3a + 2k + q + 4 ≥ 13 → 3a + 2k + q ≥ 9.\\nAlso a,k,q ≥ 0 integers and a+k+q ≤ 4 (since j=4−a−k−q≥0).\\n\\nWe enumerate all integer triples (a,k,q) with a+k+q≤4, a,k,q≥0, satisfying 3a+2k+q≥9.\\nWe organize by a.\\n\\nCase a=0:\\nThen 3a=0, condition becomes 2k + q ≥ 9, with k+q ≤4.\\nMaximum 2k+q when k=4,q=0 gives 8 < 9, so no solutions.\\nSo a=0 impossible.\\n\\nCase a=1:\\nCondition: 3*1 + 2k + q ≥ 9 → 2k + q ≥6, k+q ≤3 (since a=1 and a+k+q≤4 → k+q≤3).\\nEnumerate k from 0 to 3 and corresponding q.\\n- k=0: 2*0+q≥6 and q≤3 → q≥6, impossible.\\n- k=1: 2*1+q≥6 → 2+q≥6 → q≥4, but q≤2 (since k+q≤3), impossible.\\n- k=2: 2*2+q≥6 → 4+q≥6 → q≥2, and q≤1 (since k+q≤3 → q≤1). Contradiction.\\n- k=3: 2*3+q≥6 → 6+q≥6 → q≥0, with k+q≤3 → q≤0, so q=0.\\nCheck j: j=4−a−k−q=4−1−3−0=0.\\nSo (a,k,q,j)=(1,3,0,0) with P=3a+2k+q+4 = 3+6+0+4=13 meets P≥13.\\nThus (1,3,0,0) is a valid pattern.\\n\\nCase a=2:\\nCondition: 3*2 + 2k + q ≥ 9 → 6+2k+q ≥9 → 2k+q ≥3.\\nAlso a+k+q≤4 → k+q≤2.\\nEnumerate k from 0 to 2.\\n- k=0: 2*0+q≥3 with q≤2 → q≥3 impossible.\\n- k=1: 2*1+q≥3 → 2+q≥3 → q≥1; also q≤1 (since k+q≤2 → q≤1) so q=1.\\n  Then j=4−2−1−1=0. Pattern (2,1,1,0).\\n- k=2: 2*2+q≥3 → 4+q≥3 always holds for q≥0, but also k+q≤2 → 2+q≤2 → q≤0, so q=0.\\n  Then j=4−2−2−0=0. Pattern (2,2,0,0).\\nCheck P for both patterns:\\nFor (2,1,1,0): P=4*2+3*1+2*1+0=8+3+2=13.\\nFor (2,2,0,0): P=4*2+3*2=8+6=14.\\nBoth ≥13, valid.\\n\\nCase a=3:\\nCondition: 3*3 + 2k + q ≥9 → 9+2k+q ≥9 always true for k,q≥0.\\nConstraint: a+k+q≤4 → 3+k+q≤4 → k+q≤1.\\nSo possibilities: (k,q)=(0,0),(1,0),(0,1).\\nCompute j and P for each.\\n1) (k,q)=(0,0): j=4−3−0−0=1.

P=4*3+2*1=12+2=14.\\nAll ≥13.\\n\\nCase a=4:\\nCondition: 3*4+2k+q≥9 clearly holds; but a+k+q≤4 → 4+k+q≤4 → k+q≤0 → k=0,q=0.\\nThen j=4−4−0−0=0. Pattern (4,0,0,0). P=4*4=16.\\n\\nThus the only rank-count patterns with P≥13 are:\\n1) (a,k,q,j)=(1,3,0,0)\\n2) (2,1,1,0)\\n3) (2,2,0,0)\\n4) (3,0,0,1)\\n5) (3,1,0,0)\\n6) (3,0,1,0)\\n7) (4,0,0,0).\\nWe now count how many distinct 4-card sets correspond to each pattern.\\n\\nRecall counts per rank in deck: 4 Aces, 4 Kings, 4 Queens, 4 Jacks.\\nFor a pattern (a,k,q,j), #hands = C(4,a)*C(4,k)*C(4,q)*C(4,j).\\nCompute each.\\n1) (1,3,0,0): #1 = C(4,1)*C(4,3)*C(4,0)*C(4,0) = 4*4*1*1 = 16.\\n2) (2,1,1,0): #2 = C(4,2)*C(4,1)*C(4,1)*C(4,0) = 6*4*4*1=96.\\n3) (2,2,0,0): #3 = C(4,2)*C(4,2)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)=6*6*1*1=36.\\n4) (3,0,0,1): #4 = C(4,3)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)*C(4,1) = 4*1*1*4=16.\\n5) (3,1,0,0): #5 = C(4,3)*C(4,1)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)=4*4*1*1=16.\\n6) (3,0,1,0): #6 = C(4,3)*C(4,0)*C(4,1)*C(4,0)=4*1*4*1=16.\\n7) (4,0,0,0): #7 = C(4,4)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)=1.\\n\\nTotal favorable hands N_fav = #1+#2+#3+#4+#5+#6+#7 = 16 + 96 + 36 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 1.\\nCompute stepwise: 16+96=112, plus 36=148, plus 16=164, plus 16=180, plus 16=196, plus 1=197.\\nSo N_fav = 197.\\n\\nTotal possible high-card combinations given exactly 4 high cards is C(16,4).\\nCompute C(16,4) = 16*15*14*13 / 4! = (16*15*14*13)/24.\\n16/8=2, 15/3=5, so 4! decomposition gives 16*15*14*13/24 = (2*5*14*13)/1=10*182=1820.\\nConfirm by standard value: C(16,4)=1820.\\nThus desired probability is 197/1820.\\nSimplify 197/1820: 197 is prime (no small divisors; 197/7≈28.14, /11≈17.9, /13≈15.15). 1820 factors as 182*10= (2*91)*10=2*7*13*10=2*7*13*2*5=2^2*5*7*13.\\nNo common factors with 197, so fraction is in lowest terms.\\n\\nTherefore the required conditional probability that a 13-card hand with exactly 4 high cards has at least k=13 points is 197/1820.\\n\\nThe problem asks for this probability as the final answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"197/1820\"\n}",
