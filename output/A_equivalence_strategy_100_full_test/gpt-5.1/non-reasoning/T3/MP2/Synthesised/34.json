  "math_problem": "Let $n=2000$ and $p=23$. The exponent of $p$ in $n!$ is $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\lfloor n / p^k \\rfloor$. Find the greatest positive integer $x$ such that $p^{6+x}$ divides $n!$. Instead of determining the largest additional exponent beyond 6 for which the prime power divides the factorial, simply find $m = \\lfloor n / p \\rfloor - 36$, where $\\lfloor n / p \\rfloor$ is the first term in the sum for the exponent of $p$ in $n!$. Let $S=\\{-100,-99,-98, \\ldots, 99,100\\}$. Choose a $m$-element subset $T$ of $S$ at random. Find the expected number of elements of the set $\\{|x|: x \\in T\\}$.",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"1) Compute m.\\n- n = 2000, p = 23\\n- floor(n/p) = floor(2000/23)\\n  23 * 86 = 1978, 23 * 87 = 2001 > 2000, so floor(2000/23) = 86.\\n- m = floor(n/p) - 36 = 86 - 36 = 50.\\n\\n2) Interpret the probability problem.\\n- S = {-100, -99, ..., 99, 100}, so |S| = 201.\\n- We choose a 50-element subset T of S uniformly at random.\\n- We want the expected size of the set {|x| : x in T}, i.e., the number of distinct absolute values among elements of T.\\n\\n3) Describe the absolute value structure of S.\\n- S contains 0 once.\\n- For each k = 1 to 100, S contains both -k and k.\\n- So there are 101 distinct absolute values: 0, 1, 2, ..., 100.\\n\\n4) Use linearity of expectation.\\n- Let A_k be the event “absolute value k appears in T”.\\n- Let X be the number of distinct absolute values in {|x| : x in T}.\\n- Then X = sum_{k=0}^{100} I_k, where I_k is the indicator of A_k.\\n- So E[X] = sum_{k=0}^{100} P(A_k).\\n\\n5) Compute P(A_0).\\n- Absolute value 0 corresponds to the single element 0.\\n- T has 50 elements, chosen from 201. The probability that 0 is in T is:\\n  P(0 in T) = 50 / 201.\\n- Thus P(A_0) = 50/201.\\n\\n6) Compute P(A_k) for k ≥ 1.\\n- For k in {1, ..., 100}, absolute value k corresponds to the pair {-k, k}.\\n- A_k occurs if at least one of -k or k is in T.\\n- It is easier to compute the complement: both -k and k are not in T.\\n- There are 2 elements (-k and k) excluded out of 201, leaving 199 elements.\\n- To avoid both -k and k, T must be chosen entirely from these 199 elements.\\n- Total number of 50-element subsets: C(201, 50).\\n- Number of 50-element subsets avoiding -k and k: C(199, 50).\\n- So P(A_k does not occur) = C(199, 50) / C(201, 50).\\n\\n7) Simplify C(199, 50) / C(201, 50).\\n- C(201, 50) = 201! / (50! * 151!).\\n- C(199, 50) = 199! / (50! * 149!).\\n- Ratio:\\n  C(199, 50) / C(201, 50)\\n  = [199! / (50! * 149!)] * [(50! * 151!) / 201!]\\n  = [199! * 151!] / [149! * 201!].\\n- Write factorials in expanded form:\\n  199! / 149! = 150 * 151 * 152 * ... * 199.\\n  201! / 151! = 152 * 153 * ... * 201.\\n- Thus:\\n  C(199, 50) / C(201, 50)\\n  = (150 * 151 * 152 * ... * 199) / (152 * 153 * ... * 201)\\n  = (150 * 151) / (200 * 201).\\n- So P(A_k does not occur) = (150 * 151) / (200 * 201).\\n- Therefore P(A_k) = 1 - (150 * 151) / (200 * 201).\\n\\n8) Simplify P(A_k).\\n- Compute numerator and denominator carefully:\\n  (150 * 151) = 22650.\\n  (200 * 201) = 40200.\\n- So P(A_k) = 1 - 22650/40200 = (40200 - 22650) / 40200 = 17550 / 40200.\\n- Simplify 17550/40200:\\n  Divide numerator and denominator by 50:\\n  17550 / 50 = 351,\\n  40200 / 50 = 804,\\n  so 17550/40200 = 351/804.\\n  Divide by 3:\\n  351/3 = 117,\\n  804/3 = 268,\\n  so 341? check: 351/3 = 117, 804/3 = 268, so 351/804 = 117/268.\\n- So P(A_k) = 117/268 for each k in {1, ..., 100}.\\n\\n9) Compute expected value E[X].\\n- E[X] = P(A_0) + sum_{k=1}^{100} P(A_k)\\n       = 50/201 + 100 * (117/268).\\n- Compute 100 * (117/268) = 11700/268.\\n  Simplify 11700/268:\\n  Divide numerator and denominator by 4:\\n  11700 / 4 = 2925,\\n  268 / 4 = 67,\\n  so this is 2925/67.\\n- So E[X] = 50/201 + 2925/67.\\n\\n10) Combine the fractions 50/201 and 2925/67.\\n- Denominators are 201 and 67. Note 201 = 3 * 67.\\n- So lcm = 201.\\n- Convert 2925/67 to denominator 201:\\n  2925/67 = (2925 * 3) / (67 * 3) = 8775 / 201.\\n- Thus E[X] = 50/201 + 8775/201 = (50 + 8775) / 201 = 8825 / 201.\\n\\n11) Check for further simplification.\\n- Try to reduce 8825/201.\\n- 201 = 3 * 67.\\n- 8825 sum of digits = 8+8+2+5 = 23, not divisible by 3, so 3 does not divide 8825.\\n- Check divisibility by 67:\\n  67 * 100 = 6700, remainder 2125.\\n  67 * 30 = 2010, remainder 115.\\n  67 * 1 = 67, remainder 48.\\n  So not divisible by 67.\\n- Therefore the fraction is in lowest terms.\\n\\n12) Final answer.\\n- The expected number of distinct absolute values in {|x| : x in T} is 8825/201.\\n\\n- Ensure we report only the final answer value as requested.\\n\",\n    \"answer\": \"8825/201\"\n}",
