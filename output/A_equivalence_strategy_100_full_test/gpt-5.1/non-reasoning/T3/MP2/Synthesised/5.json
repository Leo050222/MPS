  "math_problem": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $N$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen. James writes down three integers. Alex picks some two of those integers, takes the average of them, and adds the result to the third integer. If the possible final results Alex could get are $(N - 86)$, 13, and 37, what are the three integers James originally chose?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Let the 3 integers James wrote be a, b, c. The operation Alex performs is: choose two numbers, say x and y, take their average (x + y)/2 and add it to the third number z, so the result is (x + y)/2 + z.\\n\\nWe are told the three possible results are N - 86, 13, and 37. These correspond to the three ways of choosing the pair to average:\\n1) (a + b)/2 + c\\n2) (a + c)/2 + b\\n3) (b + c)/2 + a\\n\\nWithout loss of generality, assign:\\nR1 = (a + b)/2 + c = N - 86\\nR2 = (a + c)/2 + b = 13\\nR3 = (b + c)/2 + a = 37\\n\\nFirst simplify each equation:\\nR1: (a + b)/2 + c = N - 86  ->  a + b + 2c = 2N - 172  ...(1)\\nR2: (a + c)/2 + b = 13      ->  a + c + 2b = 26        ...(2)\\nR3: (b + c)/2 + a = 37      ->  b + c + 2a = 74        ...(3)\\n\\nFrom (2) and (3), solve for a, b, c (no N involved):\\n(2) a + c + 2b = 26\\n(3) 2a + b + c = 74\\n\\nSubtract (2) from (3):\\n(2a + b + c) - (a + c + 2b) = 74 - 26\\n=> a - b = 48\\n=> a = b + 48\\n\\nUse (2): a + c + 2b = 26\\nSubstitute a = b + 48:\\n(b + 48) + c + 2b = 26\\n3b + c + 48 = 26\\n3b + c = -22  ...(4)\\n\\nWe still need a relation from the first equation that includes N.\\nBut note that we have so far used only 2 and 3, which are fixed results (13, 37). Equation (1) involves N; we use it after we connect N to the combinatorial part of the problem.\\n\\nNow, separately, determine N from the antigen interpretation.\\n\\nThere are 8 types of blood antigens, and each of the 256 students has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the 8 antigens. There are 2^8 = 256 possible subsets, and each appears exactly once among the students. For any fixed antigen (say antigen A), half of all subsets contain that antigen and half do not. Hence exactly 2^(8-1) = 128 subsets contain a given antigen.\\nTherefore N, the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen, is 128.\\n\\nNow plug N = 128 into equation (1).\\nEquation (1): a + b + 2c = 2N - 172 = 2*128 - 172 = 256 - 172 = 84  ...(1')\\n\\nSo we have the system:\\n(4) 3b + c = -22\\n(1') a + b + 2c = 84\\nand a = b + 48.\\n\\nSubstitute a = b + 48 into (1'):\\n(b + 48) + b + 2c = 84\\n2b + 2c + 48 = 84\\n2b + 2c = 36\\nb + c = 18  ...(5)\\n\\nNow solve (4) and (5):\\n(5) b + c = 18\\n(4) 3b + c = -22\\n\\nSubtract (5) from (4):\\n(3b + c) - (b + c) = -22 - 18\\n2b = -40\\nb = -20\\n\\nThen from (5): -20 + c = 18 => c = 38.\\n\\nNow a = b + 48 = -20 + 48 = 28.\\n\\nCheck the three results:\\n1) From (a + b)/2 + c = (28 - 20)/2 + 38 = 8/2 + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42\\n2) From (a + c)/2 + b = (28 + 38)/2 - 20 = 66/2 - 20 = 33 - 20 = 13\\n3) From (b + c)/2 + a = (-20 + 38)/2 + 28 = 18/2 + 28 = 9 + 28 = 37\\n\\nWe are told the possible results are (N - 86), 13, and 37. With N = 128, N - 86 = 42, so the three results {42, 13, 37} match. Therefore the three integers James originally chose are 28, -20, and 38 (in any order).\",\n    \"answer\": \"28, -20, 38\"\n}",
