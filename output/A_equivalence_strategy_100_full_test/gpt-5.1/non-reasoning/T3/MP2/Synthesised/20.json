Suppose $x^{3}-a x^{2}+b x-48$ is a polynomial with three positive roots $p, q$, and $r$ such that $p<q<r$. What is the minimum possible value of $k / p+2 / q+3 / r$ ?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n  \"reasoning\": \"First solve the Diophantine equation m^5 - n^5 = 16mn.\\n\\nFactor:\\n m^5 - n^5 = (m - n)(m^4 + m^3 n + m^2 n^2 + m n^3 + n^4).\\nSo (m - n)(m^4 + m^3 n + m^2 n^2 + m n^3 + n^4) = 16mn.\\n\\nWe look for integer solutions with opposite signs (mn < 0) and n > 0.\\nTry small n and test integer m:\\n\\nn = 1:\\n Equation: m^5 - 1 = 16m.\\n Check m = -2:\\n  (-2)^5 - 1 = -32 - 1 = -33, RHS = 16·(-2) = -32 (no).\\n m = -1: -1 - 1 = -2, RHS = -16 (no).\\n m = -3: -243 - 1 = -244, RHS = -48 (no). So no solution.\\n\\nn = 2:\\n m^5 - 32 = 32m.\\n m = -2: -32 - 32 = -64, RHS = -64 → solution (m, n) = (-2, 2).\\nThus there is a solution with opposite signs, n = 2, so k = n - 1 = 1.\\n\\nNow we have k = 1.\\n\\nNext, consider the polynomial x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48 with positive roots p < q < r.\\nBy Vieta:\\n p + q + r = a,\\n pq + pr + qr = b,\\n pqr = 48.\\nWe want to minimize F = k/p + 2/q + 3/r. With k = 1 this is\\n F = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r.\\n\\nWe treat p,q,r as positive reals with product 48 and try to find the minimum.\\nUse Lagrange multipliers for minimizing F subject to pqr = 48.\\nLet G(p,q,r) = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r + λ(pqr - 48).\\nSet partial derivatives to zero:\\n ∂G/∂p = -1/p^2 + λ q r = 0 → λ q r = 1/p^2,\\n ∂G/∂q = -2/q^2 + λ p r = 0 → λ p r = 2/q^2,\\n ∂G/∂r = -3/r^2 + λ p q = 0 → λ p q = 3/r^2.\\n\\nDivide first two:\\n (λ q r)/(λ p r) = (1/p^2)/(2/q^2) → q/p = (q^2)/(2 p^2) → 2 p = q.\\nDivide first and third:\\n (λ q r)/(λ p q) = (1/p^2)/(3/r^2) → r/p = (q^2)/(3 p^2)? (careful) Actually: (λ q r)/(λ p q) = r/p.\\nRight side: (1/p^2)/(3/r^2) = r^2/(3 p^2). So r/p = r^2/(3 p^2) → 3 p = r.\\nThus at the stationary point, q = 2p, r = 3p.\\n\\nUse pqr = 48:\\n p(2p)(3p) = 6 p^3 = 48 → p^3 = 8 → p = 2.\\nThen q = 4, r = 6.\\n\\nCompute F:\\n F = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r = 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/6 = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3/2.\\n\\nWe should check that this point gives a minimum, not maximum. As any variable tends to 0 or ∞ while maintaining pqr = 48, at least one term in F tends to ∞, so F is unbounded above and positive. Hence the critical point in the interior with all positive p,q,r is the unique global minimum.\\nTherefore, the minimum possible value of k/p + 2/q + 3/r is 3/2.\",\n  \"answer\": \"3/2\"\n}",
