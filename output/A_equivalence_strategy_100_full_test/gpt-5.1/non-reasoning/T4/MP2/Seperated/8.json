  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\nWe have the functional equation for all real x,y:\\n  f(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = x^2 f(x) + y^2 f(y) + f(xy).\\nWe only need k = f(0) + 1, where f(0) is the value at zero for any function satisfying this equation.\\n\\n1) Plug x = 0:\\n   f(0^3 + y^3 + 0·y) = f(y^3) = 0^2 f(0) + y^2 f(y) + f(0·y)\\n   => f(y^3) = y^2 f(y) + f(0).\\n   Denote f(0) = c. Then:\\n   (A)  f(y^3) = y^2 f(y) + c  for all y.\\n\\n2) Plug y = 0:\\n   f(x^3 + 0^3 + x·0) = f(x^3) = x^2 f(x) + 0^2 f(0) + f(x·0)\\n   => f(x^3) = x^2 f(x) + f(0).\\n   This is the same relation but with x.\\n   So (A) is consistent and holds for all real input.\\n\\n3) Plug x = y:\\n   f(x^3 + x^3 + x·x) = f(2x^3 + x^2) = x^2 f(x) + x^2 f(x) + f(x^2)\\n   => f(2x^3 + x^2) = 2x^2 f(x) + f(x^2).   (1)\\n\\n4) Use (A) for argument x^2:\\n   Putting t = sqrt(z) is messy; instead, apply (A) with y replaced by sqrt(t) only when needed. A simpler symmetric substitution works better: try y = -x.\\n\\n5) Plug y = -x:\\n   Left side argument: x^3 + (-x)^3 + x(-x) = x^3 - x^3 - x^2 = -x^2.\\n   So\\n   f(-x^2) = x^2 f(x) + (-x)^2 f(-x) + f(x·(-x))\\n            = x^2 f(x) + x^2 f(-x) + f(-x^2).   (2)\\n   Subtract f(-x^2) from both sides:\\n   0 = x^2 f(x) + x^2 f(-x)\\n   => x^2(f(x) + f(-x)) = 0 for all real x.\\n   Therefore for all x ≠ 0,\\n   f(-x) = -f(x).\\n   For x = 0 this gives no new information, but we see f is odd on R\\\\{0}.\\n\\n6) Use oddness with (A) to constrain c.\\n   Take any nonzero t. Using (A) with y = t:\\n   f(t^3) = t^2 f(t) + c.                 (A')\\n   Using (A) with y = -t:\\n   f((-t)^3) = (-t)^2 f(-t) + c\\n   => f(-t^3) = t^2 f(-t) + c.            (B)\\n   By oddness, f(-t^3) = -f(t^3). Use (A'):\\n   -f(t^3) = t^2 f(-t) + c\\n   => -(t^2 f(t) + c) = t^2 f(-t) + c\\n   => -t^2 f(t) - c = t^2 f(-t) + c.\\n   But f(-t) = -f(t), so t^2 f(-t) = -t^2 f(t). Substitute:\\n   -t^2 f(t) - c = -t^2 f(t) + c\\n   => -c = c\\n   => 2c = 0\\n   => c = 0.\\n\\nSo f(0) = c = 0 necessarily. Therefore k = f(0) + 1 = 1.\\n\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe seek a sequence (finite) of non-zero integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n with:\\n  - For every block of 7 consecutive terms, the sum is positive.\\n  - For every block of 11 consecutive terms, the sum is negative.\\nWe want a sequence of maximal possible length.\\n\\nThis is a classical type of extremal problem involving sliding window sums and leads to a bound on length via double-counting / inequality arguments.\\n\\n1) Translate to inequalities:\\nFor each i where it makes sense:\\n  S_7(i) = a_i + a_{i+1} + ... + a_{i+6} > 0.\\n  S_11(j) = a_j + a_{j+1} + ... + a_{j+10} < 0.\\nWe need both wherever both windows exist.\\n\\n2) Typical method: overlap windows and sum inequalities.\\nFor indices where both a 7-block and an 11-block share elements, we can combine inequalities to get constraints on partial sums like A_k = a_1 + ... + a_k.\\nHowever, there is a well-known result (appearing in contest problems) that the maximum length satisfying these specific 7/11 constraints is 16, and constructions attaining 16 terms exist.\\nThe key idea: if the sequence were of length at least 17, then by carefully adding several 7-term inequalities and subtracting some 11-term inequalities (so that coefficients cancel except for a few endpoints), you would obtain a contradiction (0 > 0 or similar), which shows n ≤ 16.\\n\\n3) Existence of a length-16 sequence.\\nA concrete integer sequence of length 16 with the required property is known in the literature of such problems; the existence shows the upper bound 16 is attainable, hence the maximal length is 16. (The specific values are not asked here, just the maximal length.)\\n\\nHence the maximal possible length is 16.\\n\\nFinal results:\\n- Problem 1: k = 1.\\n- Problem 2: The maximal length is 16.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"16\"\n}",
