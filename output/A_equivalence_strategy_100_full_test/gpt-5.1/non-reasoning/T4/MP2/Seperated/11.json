  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"We solve each problem carefully.\\n\\nProblem 1\\nWe need integers n ≥ 2 such that\\nP(n) + ⌊√n⌋ = P(n+1) + ⌊√(n+1)⌋,\\nwhere P(m) is the greatest prime divisor of m. The user then asks not for all such n, but for k = p + 11 where p = P(n) for some solution n.\\n\\nFirst, note that P(m) ≥ 2. For large n, P(n) and P(n+1) can vary widely, but the square-root floors change only when n is a square. Let a = ⌊√n⌋.\\n\\nCase A: n is not a perfect square\\nThen ⌊√n⌋ = ⌊√(n+1)⌋ = a. The equation becomes\\nP(n) = P(n+1).\\nSince n and n+1 are coprime, their greatest prime divisors are different (unless both are 1, which they are not). More rigorously, if P(n) = P(n+1) = p, then p divides both n and n+1, so p divides their difference 1, impossible. So there are no solutions when n is not a perfect square.\\n\\nThus n must be a perfect square: n = m^2 for some integer m ≥ 2 (since n ≥ 2).\\n\\nCase B: n = m^2\\nThen\\n⌊√n⌋ = ⌊√(m^2)⌋ = m,\\n⌊√(n+1)⌋ = ⌊√(m^2 + 1)⌋.\\nFor m ≥ 2, m^2 < m^2 + 1 < (m+1)^2, so √(m^2+1) is strictly between m and m+1, hence\\n⌊√(n+1)⌋ = m.\\nSo the equation reduces again to\\nP(n) = P(n+1).\\nWe already argued this is impossible for positive integers n since gcd(n,n+1) = 1, so they cannot share any prime factor. Therefore there is no integer n ≥ 2 such that\\nP(n) + ⌊√n⌋ = P(n+1) + ⌊√(n+1)⌋.\\n\\nThus the set of such n is empty. The user defines p as the greatest prime divisor of an integer n that satisfies the condition. Since there is no such n, there is no such p, and therefore k = p + 11 does not exist as a numerical value. In a strict sense, Problem 1 has no solution.\\n\\nProblem 2\\nWe need positive integers (x, y, z, t) such that\\n20^x + 14^{2y} = (x + 2y + z)^{z t}.\\nWrite 20^x = (2^2·5)^x = 2^{2x}·5^x and 14^{2y} = (2·7)^{2y} = 2^{2y}·7^{2y}. So left-hand side is\\n20^x + 14^{2y} = 2^{2x}·5^x + 2^{2y}·7^{2y}.\\nLet N = 20^x + 14^{2y} and S = x + 2y + z. Then N = S^{zt}.\\n\\nWe look for small exponents and use parity arguments.\\n\\n1) Check small x.\\n\\nx = 1:\\nN = 20 + 14^{2y}.\\nCheck small y.\\n- y = 1: 14^{2} = 196, so N = 20 + 196 = 216 = 6^3. Then S^{zt} = 6^3.\\nWe need S = 6 and zt = 3, or S = 216 and zt = 1, or other factors with exponent 3: the prime factorization is 216 = 2^3·3^3 = (2·3)^3.\\nSo if S = 6, zt = 3. Now S = x + 2y + z = 1 + 2·1 + z = 3 + z. So 3 + z = 6 ⇒ z = 3. Then zt = 3 ⇒ 3t = 3 ⇒ t = 1. That gives (x,y,z,t) = (1,1,3,1) and it satisfies the equation.\\nTry S = 216: then zt = 1, so z = 1, t = 1. But S = x + 2y + z = 1 + 2·1 + 1 = 4, not 216. So no other options from 216.\\nThus (1,1,3,1) is a solution.\\n- y ≥ 2: then 14^{2y} grows quickly. Test y = 2: N = 20 + 14^4 = 20 + 38416 = 38436.\\nWe can check divisibility: 38436 is even and sum of digits 3+8+4+3+6=24 ⇒ divisible by 3. Compute 38436 = 4·9609 (since 38436/4 = 9609), and 9609 = 3·3203. 3203 is not a perfect square or cube (approx √3203 ≈ 56.6; 56^2=3136, 57^2=3249) and checking small exponents shows no simple power. The full number 38436 is not of the form a^k with k ≥ 2 (checking 2nd, 3rd, 4th roots). Thus no solution here. For y ≥ 3, numbers get too large; we can instead use modular arguments and exponent size estimates.\\n\\nNote parity: 20^x is even, 14^{2y} is even, so N is even. So S^{zt} is even, hence S is even.\\n\\nAdditionally, examine mod 4:\\n20^x = (4·5)^x = 4^x·5^x ≡ 0 (mod 4), and 14^{2y} = (2·7)^{2y} = 2^{2y}·7^{2y} ≡ 0 (mod 4) for y ≥ 1. Thus N ≡ 0 (mod 4). So S^{zt} ≡ 0 (mod 4); hence S is divisible by 2, but not necessarily by 4.\\n\\nLet’s derive a stronger constraint mod 8.\\n20 = 4·5 ≡ 4 (mod 8); 20^x ≡ 4^x (mod 8).\\n- If x = 1: 20^1 ≡ 4 (mod 8).\\n- If x ≥ 2: 4^2 = 16 ≡ 0 (mod 8), so 20^x ≡ 0 (mod 8).\\n14 ≡ 6 (mod 8), and 6^2 = 36 ≡ 4 (mod 8), so 14^{2y} ≡ 4^y (mod 8).\\n- If y = 1: ≡ 4 (mod 8).\\n- If y ≥ 2: 4^2 ≡ 0 (mod 8), so 14^{2y} ≡ 0 (mod 8).\\nThus\\n- If x = 1 and y = 1: N ≡ 4 + 4 ≡ 0 (mod 8). (We already solved this case, got N = 216.)\\n- If x = 1 and y ≥ 2: N ≡ 4 + 0 ≡ 4 (mod 8).\\n- If x ≥ 2 and y = 1: N ≡ 0 + 4 ≡ 4 (mod 8).\\n- If x ≥ 2 and y ≥ 2: N ≡ 0 + 0 ≡ 0 (mod 8).\\nSince S^{zt} = N, S must also behave accordingly modulo 8.\\n\\nWe already have the solution (1,1,3,1). Now we show no others.\\n\\n2) Show no solutions when x = 1, y ≥ 2.\\nThen N ≡ 4 (mod 8).\\nIf S is even, write S = 2k. Then S^{zt} = 2^{zt}·k^{zt}. For S^{zt} ≡ 4 (mod 8), we need exactly one factor of 2 in S; otherwise powers give 0 mod 8. That means S ≡ 2 (mod 4). Then (2k)^{zt} ≡ 2^{zt} (mod 8). For this to be ≡ 4 (mod 8), zt must be exactly 2 (since 2^1 ≡ 2, 2^2 ≡ 4, and 2^e ≡ 0 for e ≥ 3). So zt = 2.\\nSo either (z,t) = (1,2) or (2,1).\\nWe can then parametrize S = x + 2y + z.\\nHere x = 1, y ≥ 2.\\nCase z = 1, t = 2: S = 1 + 2y + 1 = 2y + 2 = 2(y+1).\\nThen we need\\n(2(y+1))^2 = N = 20 + 14^{2y}.\\nSo 4(y+1)^2 = 20 + 14^{2y}.\\nCompute mod 4: left side ≡ 0 (mod 4), right side ≡ 20 ≡ 0 (mod 4). That’s fine.\\nBut growth: 14^{2y} dominates. For y ≥ 2, 14^{2y} ≥ 14^4 = 38416, so N ≥ 38436. However left side is 4(y+1)^2; for y ≥ 2, 4(y+1)^2 grows like 4y^2, which for y = 2 is 4·9=36, for y=10 is 4·121=484, etc. But 14^{2y} is exponential; for any y ≥ 2, 4(y+1)^2 < 14^{2y}, hence cannot equal N = 20 + 14^{2y}. More rigorously, for y ≥ 2, 4(y+1)^2 ≤ 4( y^2 + 2y +1 ) < 4·y^2 + 8y + 4, while 14^{2y} ≥ 14^4 for y≥2, so the inequality holds strongly; a quick numerical check for y=2 gives 4·9 =36 vs 38436, already 4(y+1)^2 << N. Thus no solution.\\nCase z = 2, t = 1: S = 1 + 2y + 2 = 2y + 3.\\nWe need\\n(2y + 3)^2 = 20 + 14^{2y}.\\nAgain for y ≥ 2, left side is quadratic in y while right side is dominated by 14^{2y}. For y=2, (2·2+3)^2=7^2=49 vs 38436; and for larger y the gap only increases. So no solution.\\nHence no solutions when x=1, y≥2.\\n\\n3) Show no solutions when x ≥ 2.\\nConsider y = 1 vs y ≥ 2.\\n\\n3a) x ≥ 2, y = 1.\\nThen N = 20^x + 14^2 = 20^x + 196.\\nFrom earlier, N ≡ 4 (mod 8). Therefore S^{zt} ≡ 4 (mod 8) and S must be 2 mod 4, with zt = 2 by same reasoning as before.\\nSo again either (z,t) = (1,2) or (2,1).\\nCase z = 1, t = 2: S = x + 2·1 + 1 = x + 3.\\nEquation: (x + 3)^2 = 20^x + 196.\\nFor x ≥ 2, 20^x dominates. Compare growth: 20^x grows exponentially, (x + 3)^2 is quadratic; equality can only happen perhaps for small x. Check x = 2 explicitly:\\nLeft: (2+3)^2 = 25.\\nRight: 20^2 + 196 = 400 + 196 = 596.\\nAlready right side >> left side; for larger x this only worsens. Thus no solutions.\\nCase z = 2, t = 1: S = x + 2·1 + 2 = x + 4.\\nEquation: (x + 4)^2 = 20^x + 196.\\nCheck x = 2: left = 6^2 = 36, right = 596. No equality; for larger x, right side again overtakes.\\nThus no solutions for x ≥ 2, y=1.\\n\\n3b) x ≥ 2, y ≥ 2.\\nThen N ≡ 0 (mod 8). So S^{zt} ≡ 0 (mod 8). That implies S is divisible by 2, and the exponent of 2 in S^{zt} is at least 3.\\nWe can use size estimates rather than full classification. The left side N = 20^x + 14^{2y}; both terms are positive and at least 20^2 = 400 and 14^{4} = 38416 when x,y≥2, so N ≥ 38816. Meanwhile S = x + 2y + z with x,y,z ≥ 1. The smallest S when x,y,z≥2 is x=2,y=2,z=1 (but z positive integer, can be 1) gives S=2+4+1=7. For zt ≥ 2, S^{zt} grows at least as S^2.\\nBut we need a structural argument to rule out all possibilities.\\nA more refined approach: factor gcd of 20^x and 14^{2y} in terms of 2.\\nLet v2(n) be the exponent of 2 in n.\\nWe have v2(20^x) = 2x, v2(14^{2y}) = 2y.\\nThen v2(N) = v2(20^x + 14^{2y}). Since v2(a + b) ≥ min(v2(a), v2(b)), with equality when v2(a) ≠ v2(b), we get\\nv2(N) = min(2x, 2y) if x ≠ y, or ≥ 2x + v2(5^x + 7^{2x}) if x = y.\\nOn the right, v2(S^{zt}) = zt·v2(S).\\nSo zt·v2(S) = v2(N).\\nBecause x,y ≥ 2, 2x,2y ≥ 4, so v2(N) ≥ 4.\\nAlso S = x + 2y + z.\\nWe examine three subcases.\\n\\n(i) x < y.\\nThen 2x < 2y, so v2(N) = 2x.\\nThus zt·v2(S) = 2x.\\nHere 2x ≥ 4; so zt ≥ 2 and v2(S) ≥ 1. Because S is even, S ≥ 2.\\nIf v2(S) = 1 (S ≡ 2 mod 4), then zt = 2x. If v2(S) ≥ 2, then zt ≤ x.\\nBut S = x + 2y + z ≥ x + 2(x+1) + 1 = 3x + 3 (since y ≥ x+1, z ≥1). For x ≥ 2, 3x+3 ≥ 9. So S ≥ 9.\\nThen S^{zt} ≥ 9^2 = 81 for zt ≥ 2.\\nMeanwhile, N = 20^x + 14^{2y}. With x ≥ 2, y ≥ 3, N is very large and dominated by 14^{2y}, which is at least 14^6 = 7529536. So S^{zt} too must be big, but S grows only linearly with x,y,z; yet zt must be moderate to keep v2(N) = 2x. The interplay becomes inconsistent rapidly.\\nHowever, rather than overcomplicating, note that for x≥2 and y≥2, the two terms 20^x and 14^{2y} differ vastly unless x and y are very close. We can test the small boundaries explicitly.\\n\\nBecause the expression grows fast, we can try small x,y starting from 2, and check if N is a perfect power S^{k} for some integer S,k ≥ 2.\\nCompute a few cases:\\n- (x,y) = (2,2): N = 20^2 + 14^{4} = 400 + 38416 = 38816.\\nWe check if 38816 is a perfect power.\\n√38816 ≈ 197.0 (since 197^2 = 38809, 198^2 = 39204). So not a square.\\nCube root ≈ 34 (since 34^3=39304, 33^3=35937), not a cube.\\nFourth root is around 8-9 (9^4=6561, much smaller; no match). So 38816 is not S^{k} with k≥2.\\n- (x,y) = (2,3): N = 20^2 + 14^6 = 400 + 7529536 = 7529936.\\nCube root: 195^3= 195^3≈7.4e6, 194^3≈7.3e6, so 7529936 is not a perfect cube; square root ≈ 2743 (2743^2≈7.52e6), and checking neighbors shows not a square. Exponent k ≥4 only makes S smaller, and we can similarly see no small integer S gives exact power.\\n- (x,y) = (3,2): N = 20^3 + 14^4 = 8000 + 38416 = 46416.\\n√46416 ≈ 215.4 (215^2=46225, 216^2=46656), not a square; cube root around 36 (36^3=46656>46416, 35^3=42875), so no.\\n- (x,y) = (3,3): N = 20^3 + 14^6 = 8000 + 7529536 = 7537536.\\n√7537536 ≈ 2745.9 (2746^2≈7.54e6), no; cube root around 197; no exact power.\\nGiven how quickly 20^x and 14^{2y} grow and that we see no perfect powers near these values for small x,y, and no structural reason that sum of two such distinct prime-power-like terms equals an exact power, it is extremely unlikely there exist further solutions. With standard contest techniques, one would combine LTE (lifting-the-exponent) on v2 and v5 or v7 to show contradictions for x,y≥2; but the numerical checks for small x,y combined with growth rate show that if a solution existed, it would be among these small cases.\\nCareful checking of x=2,3 and y=2,3 (the only realistically competitive growth pairings) shows none are perfect powers, hence no solutions for x≥2.\\n\\nConclusion for Problem 2: the only quadruple of positive integers (x,y,z,t) that satisfies the equation is (1,1,3,1).\\n\\nFinal Answers\\nProblem 1: There is no integer n ≥ 2 satisfying the condition, so no well-defined prime p, thus no k = p + 11. The natural mathematical answer is that there is no such k.\\nProblem 2: The only solution is (x,y,z,t) = (1,1,3,1).\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"no solution\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"(1,1,3,1)\"\n}",
