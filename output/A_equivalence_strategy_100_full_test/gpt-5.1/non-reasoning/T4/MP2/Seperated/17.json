Try f(n) = n.\\nCheck (1): f(1)=1 holds.\\nCheck (2): For general n,\\nLHS = 3 f(n) f(2n+1) = 3 n (2n+1) = 6n^2 + 3n\\nRHS = f(2n)(1+3 f(n)) = (2n)(1+3n) = 2n + 6n^2\\nComparing LHS and RHS: 6n^2 + 3n vs 6n^2 + 2n, they differ by n, so f(n)=n does not satisfy (2).\\n\\nTry a more systematic approach: solve for f(2n+1) explicitly in terms of f(2n) and f(n):\\n  f(2n+1) = f(2n)/3f(n) + f(2n)\\nBut that does not simplify nicely unless f(2n) has form proportional to f(n).\\n\\nInstead, look for multiplicative form, guess f(n) = a_n where ratios between even/odd indices might be controlled.\\nFrom (3): f(2n) < 6 f(n). That gives an upper inequality but no equality form.\\n\\nStep 3: Construct values from the base\\nStart from n=1.\\nWe know f(1)=1.\\nApply (2) for n=1:\\n3 f(1) f(3) = f(2) (1+3 f(1))\\n=> 3*1*f(3) = f(2)*(1+3) = 4 f(2)\\n=> 3 f(3) = 4 f(2)\\nSo f(2) must be divisible by 3. Let f(2) = 3k, then f(3)=4k.\\nUse (3) for n=1:\\n f(2) < 6 f(1) => 3k < 6 => k < 2 => k ∈ {1} (since k is a positive integer).\\nSo k=1, hence\\n f(2) = 3\\n f(3) = 4.\\n\\nNow use n=2:\\n3 f(2) f(5) = f(4)(1+3 f(2))\\n=> 3*3*f(5) = f(4)(1+9) = 10 f(4)\\n=> 9 f(5) = 10 f(4)\\nSo f(4) is divisible by 9, let f(4)=9m, then f(5)=10m.\\nFrom (3) with n=2:\\n f(4) < 6 f(2) => 9m < 18 => m < 2 => m ∈ {1}.\\nHence f(4)=9 and f(5)=10.\\n\\nNext n=3:\\n3 f(3) f(7) = f(6)(1+3 f(3))\\n=> 3*4 f(7) = f(6)(1+12) = 13 f(6)\\n=> 12 f(7) = 13 f(6).\\nThus f(6) must be divisible by 12, so f(6) = 12p, f(7) = 13p.\\nFrom (3) with n=3:\\n f(6) < 6 f(3) => 12p < 24 => p < 2 => p ∈ {1}.\\nThus f(6)=12, f(7)=13.\\n\\nSimilarly n=4:\\n3 f(4) f(9) = f(8)(1+3 f(4))\\n=> 3*9 f(9) = f(8)(1+27) = 28 f(8)\\n=> 27 f(9) = 28 f(8), hence f(8) divisible by 27: let f(8) = 27q, f(9)=28q.\\nUsing (3) with n=4:\\n f(8) < 6 f(4) => 27q < 54 => q < 2 => q ∈ {1}.\\nSo f(8)=27, f(9)=28.\\n\\nWe see a strong pattern:\\n f(1)=1\\n f(2)=3\\n f(3)=4\\n f(4)=9\\n f(5)=10\\n f(6)=12\\n f(7)=13\\n f(8)=27\\n f(9)=28\\nThis suggests f(2^k) = 3^k and for 2^k ≤ n < 2^{k+1}, f(n) = n + (3^k - 2^k).\\nCheck this pattern against the computed values:\\nFor k=0: 2^0=1, 3^0=1, for n in [1,2): only n=1, f(1)=1+(1-1)=1.\\nFor k=1: 2 ≤ n < 4, 3^1 - 2^1 = 3-2=1. Then f(2)=2+1=3, f(3)=3+1=4.\\nFor k=2: 4 ≤ n < 8, 3^2 - 2^2 = 9-4=5, so f(4)=4+5=9, f(5)=5+5=10, f(6)=6+5=11 (but we got 12), f(7)=7+5=12 (but we got 13).\\nSo that naive linear shift pattern is wrong; our earlier values force different behavior.\\n\\nInstead, observe the precise ratios from the functional equation combined with (3):\\nFrom n=1: f(2)=3 f(1), f(3)=4 f(1) => factors 3,4.\\nFrom n=2: f(4)=3 f(2), f(5)= (10/9) f(4) = (10/3) f(2).\\nGiven the uniqueness forced by divisibility plus inequality, each step yields f(2n) = 3 f(n) and f(2n+1) = 4 f(n) for these first few n? Let's check:\\nFor n=1:\\n f(2)=3 f(1)=3*1=3 correct.\\n f(3)=4 f(1)=4*1=4 correct.\\nFor n=2:\\n 3 f(2) f(5) = f(4)(1+3 f(2)) => 9 f(5) = 10 f(4). If we assume f(4)=3 f(2)=9, then f(5)=10.\\nOn the other hand, 4 f(2)=12, but f(5)=10, so the pattern f(2n+1)=4 f(n) is false.\\nSo that simple rule does not hold globally.\\n\\nHowever, note that for the even arguments we kept getting f(2n) = 3 f(n):\\nFor n=1: f(2)=3 f(1)=3.\\nWe also saw f(4)=9 which equals 3 f(2); f(6)=12 which equals 3 f(3); f(8)=27 which equals 3 f(4).\\nThus it appears that f(2n) = 3 f(n) always.\\n\\nProve f(2n) = 3 f(n)\\nWe test this hypothesis against the functional equation.\\nAssume f(2n)=3 f(n) for all n. Then (2) becomes\\n3 f(n) f(2n+1) = 3 f(n) (1 + 3 f(n))\\n=> dividing by 3 f(n) (positive), f(2n+1) = 1 + 3 f(n).\\nSo if the relation f(2n) = 3 f(n) holds, then automatically f(2n+1) = 1 + 3 f(n) satisfies (2).\\nNow check whether this also respects (3): f(2n) = 3 f(n) then (3) is 3 f(n) < 6 f(n), which is true for all n, so (3) is automatically satisfied (and actually not sharp). Thus, (2) and (3) together are consistent with the recursive system\\n f(1)=1,\\n f(2n) = 3 f(n),\\n f(2n+1) = 1 + 3 f(n).\\nWe still need to confirm uniqueness: starting from f(1)=1, if we assume only (2) and (3), then at each step n, (2) relates f(2n) and f(2n+1) via an integer divisibility constraint, and (3) restricts f(2n) < 6 f(n). For the small n we tested, the combination uniquely forced f(2n)=3 f(n); there was no room for larger multiples because (3) cut everything down to a single integer solution.\\nIn general, from (2) solve for f(2n+1):\\n 3 f(n) f(2n+1) = f(2n)(1+3 f(n))\\n=> f(2n+1) = f(2n) (1+3 f(n)) / (3 f(n)).\\nFor f(2n+1) to be an integer, 3 f(n) must divide f(2n)(1+3 f(n)). Write f(2n) = c f(n). Then\\n f(2n+1) = c (1+3 f(n)) / 3.\\nFor this to be integer, c must be divisible by 3 (because 1+3 f(n) ≡ 1 (mod 3)); let c = 3m. Then\\n f(2n) = 3m f(n),\\n f(2n+1) = m (1+3 f(n)).\\nInequality (3) is\\n f(2n) = 3m f(n) < 6 f(n) => 3m < 6 => m < 2 => m ∈ {1}.\\nSince f(2n) is positive, m≥1, so m=1.\\nThus c=3, so f(2n) = 3 f(n) and then f(2n+1) = 1+3 f(n). This derivation works for all n because it only used the fact that f(n) ∈ N and the two axioms (2) and (3).\\nTherefore, the function is uniquely determined by\\n f(1)=1,\\n f(2n)=3 f(n),\\n f(2n+1)=1+3 f(n), for all n.\\n\\nStep 4: Recognize explicit closed form\\nThis recursion shows that f is defined by repeatedly applying base-2 decomposition: moving from n to 2n multiplies by 3, and adding 1 to 2n increases by 1. We can compute f(47) by moving backwards using these rules.\\n\\nCompute f(47):\\n47 is odd, so 47 = 2*23 + 1.\\nThen\\n f(47) = 1 + 3 f(23).\\nCompute f(23): odd, 23 = 2*11 + 1:\\n f(23) = 1 + 3 f(11).\\nCompute f(11): odd, 11 = 2*5 + 1:\\n f(11) = 1 + 3 f(5).\\nCompute f(5): odd, 5 = 2*2 + 1:\\n f(5) = 1 + 3 f(2).\\nCompute f(2): even, 2 = 2*1:\\n f(2) = 3 f(1) = 3*1 = 3.\\nSo now step upward:\\n f(5) = 1 + 3 f(2) = 1 + 3*3 = 1 + 9 = 10.\\n f(11) = 1 + 3 f(5) = 1 + 3*10 = 1 + 30 = 31.\\n f(23) = 1 + 3 f(11) = 1 + 3*31 = 1 + 93 = 94.\\n f(47) = 1 + 3 f(23) = 1 + 3*94 = 1 + 282 = 283.\\nThus f(47) = 283.\\nThe problem asks for t = f(47) - 278:\\n t = 283 - 278 = 5.\\nSo the answer to Problem 1 is 5.\\n\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have real numbers a,b,c,d,e ≥ -1 with a+b+c+d+e = 5, and we need the maximum and minimum of\\n S = (a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+e)(e+a).\\n\\nStep 1: Interpret constraints and think of symmetry\\nThe sum constraint is symmetric in a,b,c,d,e, and the expression S is symmetric under cyclic permutations. By symmetry, we expect extremal configurations to have many variables equal, possibly with some hitting the boundary -1.\\nSince the sum is fixed and lower bound is -1, and S is a product of 5 terms each linear in the variables, we look for candidates where the variables are equal or where some are at -1 with the rest adjusted to satisfy the sum.\\n\\nStep 2: Consider all equal\\nIf a=b=c=d=e=t, then 5t=5 ⇒ t=1, so a=b=c=d=e=1.\\nThen each factor (a+b) = 2, so S = 2^5 = 32.\\nThis gives a candidate value S=32.\\nWe need to determine if this is maximum or minimum.\\n\\nStep 3: Analyze sign and possible zero values\\nNotice each factor such as (a+b) is ≥ -2 (since each variable ≥ -1), so factors can be negative, zero, or positive. S might be negative, zero, or positive. The constraints allow, for example, some variables at -1 and others large enough to keep the sum 5.\\nCheck if we can get S=0 by making one factor zero.\\nWe want (a+b)=0 or (b+c)=0, etc. Suppose a+b=0 with a,b≥-1. Then b=-a, and a,b≥-1 imply a∈[-1,1]. The sum constraint:\\n a + b + c + d + e = (a - a) + c + d + e = c + d + e =5, so c+d+e=5 with each ≥ -1. This is feasible; for example c=d=e=5/3> -1. So S can be zero, because (a+b)=0 and other factors remain finite. Thus 0 is attainable.\\nWe need to see if S can be negative (thus giving a smaller minimum) or larger than 32 (for maximum).\\n\\nStep 4: Attempt to minimize S: seek negative product\\nTo get S negative, an odd number of factors must be negative. Let's see if we can have exactly one factor negative and others positive, while respecting a,b,c,d,e ≥ -1.\\nTake (a+b)<0, others >0. For (a+b)<0 with a,b≥-1, a+b > -2, so (a+b)∈(-2,0). But we also must keep total sum 5. For rough extremal search, we suspect the minimum might occur at the boundary where some variables equal -1.\\nTry an extreme corner: set as many variables as possible to -1, but keep sum 5.\\nIf four variables are -1, say a=b=c=d=-1, then e = 5 - (-1-1-1-1) = 5+4 =9.\\nCompute S:\\n a+b = -2,\\n b+c = -2,\\n c+d = -2,\\n d+e = -1+9 = 8,\\n e+a = 9-1 = 8.\\nThen S = (-2)(-2)(-2)(8)(8) = (-8)(64) = -512.\\nSo S can reach -512, which is significantly less than 0. We need to check this is allowed: all variables are ≥ -1 (true). So S=-512 is feasible.\\nWe should check if even smaller values (more negative) are possible.\\nTry the pattern with three variables -1, others adjusted. Let a=b=c=-1. Then d+e = 5 - (a+b+c) = 5-(-3) = 8; thus d+e=8 with d,e ≥ -1.\\nCompute factors in terms of d,e:\\n a+b = -2,\\n b+c = -2,\\n c+d = -1 + d,\\n d+e = 8,\\n e+a = e-1.\\nSo S = (-2)(-2)(c+d)(d+e)(e+a) = 4 (d-1)(8)(e-1).\\nAlso, d+e =8.\\nLet x = d-1, y=e-1. Then d≥-1 => x≥-2; e≥-1 => y≥-2. Also d+e = x+1 + y+1 = x+y+2 = 8 => x+y=6.\\nThus S = 32 x y with x,y≥-2 and x+y=6.\\nThen y=6-x, and S(x)=32 x(6-x) = 32(6x - x^2) = -32(x^2 - 6x).\\nThis is a concave quadratic opening down; its minimum occurs at boundary. The product x y with fixed sum 6 is minimized when one variable is as small as possible, i.e., x or y = -2, the other then is 8.\\nIf x=-2, y=8: S = 32*(-2*8) = 32*(-16) = -512.\\nIf x=8,y=-2: same S=-512.\\nSo the minimum S achievable in this family is -512, same as the 4x(-1)+9 configuration.\\nCould we do better with 2 variables at -1? It seems the extremum when pushing to the boundary yields similar forms, but we must check whether we can exceed -512 in magnitude.\\n\\nTry general boundary search: Suppose k variables are -1, others positive enough to sum to 5. Because sum is fixed to 5, as we increase some above 1 to compensate, the sums like (a+b) grow, and the signs of factors are determined essentially by how many -1's are near each other in the cyclic sums. Trial with k=4 produced -512. Try k=5: then sum would be -5, impossible. k=3 we already effectively analyzed to show minimal S=-512 in that constrained family, consistent with k=4 case. k=2,1 would involve less extreme negative neighbors and likely yield a product with smaller magnitude.\\nGiven the simplicity and symmetry, and the explicit optimization in the k=3 case reducing to a clean quadratic with minimum -512, and direct computation for k=4 giving the same -512, this strongly suggests S_min = -512.\\nWe can check another extreme: let a=b=c=d=-1,e=9 we did; or with three -1's distributed differently, like a=c=e=-1, etc. but the cyclic product structure ends up with at most three negative factors, and the same bounding occurs; the found -512 is very likely the global minimum.\\n\\nStep 5: Check for larger maximum than 32\\nNow check whether we can get S>32 by moving some variables to -1 and others larger, producing large positive product.\\nFor a=b=c=d=-1,e=9 we had S=-512 (negative). To get large positive, we want an even number of negative factors, and all factors large in magnitude. But having -1's makes neighboring sums small or negative. It is not obvious, so we should test plausible patterns.\\nBecause the constraint is convex and S is a degree-5 polynomial, the maximum under linear constraints and box constraints often occurs at interior critical points where gradients line up with constraints. By symmetry, an interior critical point must have all variables equal, i.e., a=b=c=d=e=1, which yields S=32. To get another interior critical point with non-equal variables would break the symmetry unless there's a structured pattern; but with a fully symmetric domain and symmetric objective, the only interior symmetric critical point is all-equal, which will either be a global maximum or minimum in the interior. However, we already have boundary points with S=-512 < 32, so the interior point can't be the global minimum; it is likely the global maximum.\\nWe should also check boundary candidates where some variables are at -1: but there the cyclic sums near -1 become at most a few units, while the sum constraint limits how big the compensating variables can grow. For instance, if three variables are -1 and two sum to 8, the maxima of the factors come when these two are equal at 4, giving a configuration a=b=c=-1, d=e=4. Compute S:\\n a+b = -2,\\n b+c = -2,\\n c+d = -1+4=3,\\n d+e = 8,\\n e+a = 4-1=3.\\nThen S = (-2)(-2)(3)(8)(3) = 4*72 = 288.\\nBut note that here we mis-signed: (-2)(-2)=4, 4*3*8*3 = 4*72 = 288 positive, which is much larger than 32. However, is this configuration allowed? Check: a=b=c=-1, d=e=4: indeed each ≥ -1 and sum = -1-1-1+4+4 =5. So S=288 is feasible.\\nTherefore, 32 is not the maximum; 288 is larger. We must seek the true maximum.\\nWe need systematic optimization.\\n\\nStep 6: Systematic search for maximum using symmetry and Lagrange-type reasoning by structure\\nGiven the domain is convex and closed and S is continuous, maximum exists. Based on symmetry, we can suspect that extremizers might have variables taking at most two distinct values arranged in a repeating pattern, or some at -1 and others equal.\\nWe already found a candidate with 3 variables at -1 and 2 equal at 4, giving S=288.\\nWe can generalize this approach: consider patterns with k variables = -1 and 5-k variables = t, all identical, satisfying the sum constraint.\\nCase A: 3 variables at -1, 2 equal to t.\\nThen 3*(-1) + 2t = 5 => -3 + 2t =5 => 2t=8 => t=4. So the only possibility is exactly a=b=c=-1, d=e=4 (up to permutation).\\nBut the value of S depends on the cyclic ordering; different permutations may yield different products.\\nWe computed one ordering where the three -1's are consecutive and the two 4's adjacent (a=b=c=-1, d=e=4). Let's compute S explicitly for that ordering (we already did):\\n S = (a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+e)(e+a).\\nPlug a=b=c=-1, d=e=4:\\n a+b = -2,\\n b+c = -2,\\n c+d = 3,\\n d+e = 8,\\n e+a = 3.\\nSo S = (-2)(-2)(3)(8)(3) = 4*72=288.\\nTry a different arrangement: e.g., a=b=-1, c=d=e=4? But then sum would be: -1-1+4+4+4=10≠5, so not allowed.\\nThe sum condition fixes exactly that pattern of values; but we can permute positions of the three -1s and two 4s arbitrarily while keeping counts. However, if the -1s are not consecutive, some sums like (4+4)=8 and some like (4-1)=3, (-1-1)=-2, etc. We can compute general S for patterns with exactly three -1s and two 4s, as a function of their cyclic arrangement, and see which arrangement maximizes S.\\nHowever, note that any pair of neighbors among {a,b,c,d,e} yields one of the sums -2, 3, or 8, because sums of -1 and -1 is -2, 4 and -1 is 3, and 4 and 4 is 8.\\nWe need at least two 4s, so there will be at least one pair of neighboring 4s or they might be separated by -1s. To maximize the product, we want as many large factors as possible and avoid negative factors. Negative factors arise from adjacent -1s because -1+-1 = -2 < 0; 4-1=3>0; 4+4=8>0.\\nSo the best arrangement should avoid adjacent -1s (so no factor -2), and make the 4s consecutive (so there is an 8 factor). Let's test the arrangement: put the two 4s together and separate the three -1s so that none are adjacent. But on a 5-cycle with 3 -1s and 2 4s, it is impossible to avoid adjacency of -1s entirely because there are more -1s than 4s; but we can at least reduce the number of -2 factors.\\nConsider our previous arrangement a=b=c=-1, d=e=4. That had two adjacent -1 pairs: (a,b) and (b,c), both giving -2; and the 4s are adjacent, giving 8. Total factors: -2,-2,3,8,3.\\nTry another arrangement: a=-1, b=4, c=-1, d=4, e=-1 (alternating -1 and 4 as much as possible). Then sums:\\n a+b = -1+4=3,\\n b+c = 4-1=3,\\n c+d = -1+4=3,\\n d+e = 4-1=3,\\n e+a = -1-1 = -2.\\nThus S = 3*3*3*3*(-2) = 81*(-2) = -162, worse than 288.\\nTry arrangement: a=-1, b=-1, c=4, d=-1, e=4.\\nSums:\\n a+b = -2,\\n b+c = 3,\\n c+d = 3,\\n d+e = 3,\\n e+a = 3.\\nThen S = (-2)*3*3*3*3 = -2*81 = -162.\\nTry arrangement: a=-1, b=4, c=4, d=-1, e=-1.\\nSums:\\n a+b = 3,\\n b+c = 8,\\n c+d = 3,\\n d+e = -2,\\n e+a = -2.\\nThen S = 3*8*3*(-2)*(-2) = 72*4 = 288.\\nThus the max over 3x(-1), 2x4 patterns is 288, achieved in arrangements that have two -2s and an 8.\\nSo with 3 variables -1 and 2 equal, the maximum is 288.\\n\\nCase B: 2 variables at -1, 3 equal to t.\\nLet two of them be -1, three be t, with sum:\\n 2*(-1) + 3t = 5 => -2 + 3t =5 => 3t=7 => t=7/3.\\nThus values are -1,-1,7/3,7/3,7/3.\\nNow we analyze S for different cyclic arrangements. Adjacent sums are either -2 (between two -1s), (7/3-1)=4/3 (between -1 and 7/3), or 14/3 (between two 7/3s).\\nWe want to maximize the product of five such factors.\\nTo keep product positive and large, we might prefer to have the two -1's adjacent (exactly one -2 factor), and the three 7/3 adjacent in the remaining three positions, creating two consecutive 7/3 pairs (each giving 14/3) and two cross pairs between -1 and 7/3 (each 4/3).\\nPlace a=b=-1, c=d=e=7/3. Then sums:\\n a+b = -2,\\n b+c = -1+7/3 = 4/3,\\n c+d = 14/3,\\n d+e = 14/3,\\n e+a = 7/3-1 = 4/3.\\nThen S = (-2) * (4/3) * (14/3) * (14/3) * (4/3).\\nCompute magnitude: 2 * 4 * 14 * 14 * 4 divided by 3^4.\\nTop: 2*4*14*14*4 = 2*4*4*14*14 = 32*196 = 6272.\\nDenominator: 81.\\nSign: negative (because exactly one negative factor -2). So S = -6272/81 ≈ -77.4. This is smaller than 32, but not relevant for maximum. For maximum we consider positive patterns.\\nTo get positive S, we need an even number of negative factors. Negative factors occur only as -2 from adjacent (-1,-1), since t>0 so other sums non-negative. Having adjacent -1s yields one -2. To get a second negative, we would need another adjacent (-1,-1), impossible with only two -1s. So any arrangement with 2 -1s and 3 t's has exactly one -2 factor and the rest non-negative, leading to S≤0? Not exactly: one negative factor times positive others gives S<0. Thus any configuration with exactly two -1s yields S≤0, so it cannot provide a maximum larger than 288.\\n\\nCase C: 1 variable -1, 4 equal t.\\nSum: -1 + 4t = 5 => 4t=6 => t=3/2.\\nSo values are -1, 3/2,3/2,3/2,3/2. Adjacent sums are either -1+3/2=1/2 or 3/2+3/2=3.\\nThere is no pair of -1,-1 now, so all sums are non-negative: 1/2 or 3. Product S will be positive.\\nTo maximize S, we want as many 3 factors as possible and as few 1/2 as possible. On the 5-cycle, the -1 can be between two 3/2 neighbors at a single location, so there are exactly two sums involving -1 (one on each side of it), both equal 1/2. The remaining three adjacent pairs are between 3/2's, each giving 3. So for any arrangement, S = (1/2)^2 * 3^3 = (1/4)*27 = 27/4 = 6.75 < 32.\\nThus this case cannot exceed 32.\\n\\nCase D: 4 variables -1, 1 variable t.\\nSum: 4*(-1)+t =5 => t=9. We already evaluated this: a=b=c=d=-1,e=9, S=-512, negative.\\n\\nThus, among patterns where some are -1 and others equal, the largest positive S found is 288 from the pattern with three -1s and two 4s.\\n\\nStep 7: Are there mixed patterns with more than two distinct values that give larger S?\\nWe must consider the possibility of interior maxima on faces where some variables are at -1, but the others not necessarily equal. However, for a given set of which variables are stuck at -1, one can attempt to optimize over the remaining ones under linear constraints; due to symmetry and convexity considerations, maxima on such faces will tend to occur when the free variables are equal, as we effectively used in the above pattern analysis. For example, in Case A we allowed the two non -1's to differ and then found the symmetric equal case gave extremal values. A more formal Lagrange multiplier argument, considering each face defined by some a_i=-1, would show that at a stationary point, all remaining free variables must be equal due to symmetry in the objective restricted to that face.\\nSince we have already optimized each pattern of how many variables are at -1 (0,1,2,3,4) under the assumption that the rest are equal, and we saw that patterns with 2,-1 lead to negative max, 1,-1 to small positive, 3,-1 to 288, 0,-1 to 32, 4,-1 negative, the global maximum among those is 288.\\nHence S_max = 288, achieved by (a,b,c,d,e) being any permutation of (-1,-1,-1,4,4) arranged so that three -1s consecutive and two 4s consecutive, though cyclic shifts and reflections yield the same product 288.\\n\\nStep 8: Summarize extrema\\nWe found:\\n- Minimum S_min = -512, achieved e.g. at (a,b,c,d,e)=(-1,-1,-1,-1,9) (and cyclic permutations).\\n- Maximum S_max = 288, achieved e.g. at (a,b,c,d,e)=(-1,-1,-1,4,4) with three consecutive -1s and the two 4s adjacent in the cycle.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: t = f(47) - 278 = 5.\\nProblem 2: S_min = -512, S_max = 288.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"S_min = -512, S_max = 288\"\n}",
