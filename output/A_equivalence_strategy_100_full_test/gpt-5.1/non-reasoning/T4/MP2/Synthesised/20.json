Alice and Bob play a game on a board consisting of one row of $k + 2021$ consecutive squares. They take turns placing tiles that cover two adjacent squares, with Alice going first. By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule. Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends; Bob's goal is to minimize it.

  "reasoning_content": "{  \n  \"reasoning\": \"We need positive integers n and k_1,...,k_n with sum k_1+...+k_n = 5n-4 and reciprocal sum 1/k_1+...+1/k_n = 1. Let’s find the solution with minimal n by structural/size considerations.\\n\\n1) Basic bounds on k_i:\\nSince all k_i are positive integers and sum to 5n-4, the average value of the k_i is (5n-4)/n = 5 - 4/n, which is in (1,5]. Also, from 1/k_1+...+1/k_n = 1, the harmonic mean of the k_i is n. The harmonic mean is at most the arithmetic mean, so n ≤ 5-4/n. This gives n^2 + 4 ≤ 5n, or n^2 - 5n + 4 ≤ 0 ⇒ (n-1)(n-4) ≤ 0, so 1 ≤ n ≤ 4. Thus the possible n are 1,2,3,4.\\n\\n2) Check n = 1:\\nThen we need k_1 = 5*1 - 4 = 1 and 1/k_1 = 1, i.e. k_1=1 works. So (n,k_1) = (1,1) is a solution. But we also need to understand the structural conditions the problem alludes to; in many contest contexts, this trivial n=1 solution is disregarded when one is asked to represent 1 as a sum of reciprocals of integers under a fixed linear condition on the k_i because it does not give insight into the tiling part. We proceed to higher n to see if there is a more structured, non-trivial solution.\\n\\n3) Check n = 2:\\nWe need k_1+k_2 = 5*2-4 = 6 and 1/k_1+1/k_2 = 1. Rewriting 1/k_1+1/k_2 = 1 as (k_1+k_2)/(k_1 k_2) = 1 gives k_1+k_2 = k_1 k_2. Substitute k_1+k_2 = 6 to get k_1 k_2 = 6. So k_1,k_2 are positive integer factor pairs of 6: (1,6),(2,3),(3,2),(6,1). Only (2,3) and (3,2) sum to 5, not 6? Wait, check: 2+3=5, so that doesn’t meet the sum 6; (1,6) sums to 7, (6,1) sums to 7. So no pair sums to 6 with product 6. Hence there is no n=2 solution.\\n\\n4) Check n = 3:\\nWe need k_1+k_2+k_3 = 5*3-4 = 11 and 1/k_1+1/k_2+1/k_3 = 1.\\nWe can use bounding: each k_i ≥ 1. If any k_i = 1, then 1/k_i = 1, so the other two reciprocals must sum to 0, impossible. So k_i ≥ 2 for all i. If all were ≥ 3, then each reciprocal ≤ 1/3, and the sum ≤ 3*(1/3) = 1, so the only way to get sum 1 is all equal to 3. But then k_1+k_2+k_3 = 9 ≠ 11. Therefore at least one k_i = 2, and none is 1.\\nWLOG let k_1 = 2. Then 1/k_2+1/k_3 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Also k_2+k_3 = 11-2 = 9. Then (k_2+k_3)/(k_2 k_3) = 1/2 ⇒ 9/(k_2 k_3) = 1/2 ⇒ k_2 k_3 = 18. We need positive integer factors of 18 that sum to 9: they are (3,6) and (6,3). Both sum to 9. So up to ordering, the solution is (k_1,k_2,k_3) = (2,3,6), with permutations allowed.\\nThis is a valid solution: 2+3+6 = 11, and 1/2+1/3+1/6 = 1.\\n\\n5) Check n = 4:\\nWe need k_1+...+k_4 = 5*4-4 = 16 and 1/k_1+...+1/k_4 = 1.\\nAgain, if some k_i = 1, that reciprocal is 1, and the rest must sum to 0, impossible. So k_i ≥ 2. If all k_i ≥ 4, then each reciprocal ≤ 1/4 so the sum ≤ 4*(1/4)=1, with equality only if all are exactly 4. That gives sum 16, so (4,4,4,4) satisfies both conditions. Thus n=4 has a solution.\\n\\n6) Minimal n under structural considerations:\\nWe found solutions for n=1,3,4, with no solution for n=2. The problem statement says: “Instead of finding all positive integers n and corresponding k_1, \\\\dots, k_n satisfying the sum and reciprocal sum conditions, simply find k, where k is the part size in the solution with the smallest possible n, derived from the structural consideration of minimal number of terms in the representation.”\\nThe n=1 solution uses a single part of size 1, but that is somewhat degenerate for the intended representation (it does not give non-trivial decomposition of 1 as a sum of multiple unit fractions under the linear sum condition). In many combinatorial/number-theoretic contest problems of this form, when they speak of “representation” and “minimal number of terms,” they focus on representations with at least two terms. With that structural intent, the minimal n with a non-trivial multi-term representation is n = 3, with part sizes {2,3,6}.\\nWe now need a single k (a scalar) fed into the game; it is natural and standard in such contest problems that when a multiset of part sizes appears, the one they refer to as “k” for a follow-up tiling game is the smallest repeating structural component, typically the gcd or the smallest part that describes a modulus or block size. Here, the smallest part size in the minimal non-trivial solution is k = 2.\\nThus we adopt k = 2 as the game’s parameter.\\n\\n7) Game with board of length k + 2021:\\nThe board has one row of N = k+2021 squares. Using k = 2 yields N = 2+2021 = 2023 squares.\\nAlice and Bob alternately place 1×2 tiles on consecutive squares; no overlaps; game ends when no legal placement remains. Alice wants to maximize the number of uncovered squares at the end; Bob wants to minimize that number.\\nWe must find the greatest number M of uncovered squares Alice can force, regardless of Bob’s play.\\n\\nObservation: On any finite 1×N strip with 1×2 domino moves, the parity of covered squares is always even. Thus the parity of the number of uncovered squares is the same as the parity of N: uncovered ≡ N (mod 2). For N = 2023 (odd), the number of uncovered squares is always odd. So Bob cannot force 0 uncovered; at least 1 square remains uncovered.\\nHowever, Bob can often pack dominoes efficiently. The maximum tiling coverage is 2 * floor(N/2) squares. So the minimum possible number of uncovered squares (best for Bob) is N - 2*floor(N/2). For N odd, this is 1. Therefore, in the absence of turn-order or forced-configuration constraints, there exists some final placement with exactly 1 uncovered square.\\nWe now ask: can Alice, by her strategy, force more than 1 uncovered square? Or can Bob always respond to hold the total uncovered squares down to 1, regardless of Alice’s moves?\\n\\nKey idea for 1×N impartial placement games with 1×2 tiles: A player seeking to minimize uncovered squares can mirror moves to ensure that the final tiling is as full as parity permits. When N is odd, there is a central square, and a symmetry strategy is usually available: if Bob always plays the reflection of Alice’s move across the central cell, he can ensure that every pair of symmetric squares ends up tiled, leaving at most the central cell uncovered.\\nConcretely, for N = 2023, label squares 1,...,2023. The central square is c = (N+1)/2 = 1012. For each square i ≠ c there is a partner square j = N+1-i. So each domino placement in the left half has a mirror in the right half. When Alice plays a domino on squares (i,i+1) with i < c, Bob can place a domino on the mirrored pair (N-i, N-i+1), provided those squares are free. Because the game is symmetric and they alternate, Bob can always perform this mirrored response as long as Alice’s move is not symmetric about the center. If Alice places a domino that straddles the center, then that domino covers two squares around the center and breaks the perfect symmetric pairing. But if the goal is to minimize uncovered squares, such a central-straddling move by Alice typically harms her objective because it makes it easier for Bob to pack the rest densely.\\nWe must consider whether Alice can deviate from the symmetry-friendly pattern to force more than 1 hole.\\n\\nBut Bob’s objective is to minimize holes; among all play paths, he will pick responses that keep the board as packable as possible. On an odd-length path, with perfect alternating rational play, a standard argument shows Bob can ensure that after every pair of consecutive moves (Alice then Bob), the board splits into smaller segments that each either have even length (fully tileable) or an odd length with a central point reserved to end up as the final uncovered square. In any such subgame, the player with the passively defensive goal (Bob) can choose a response on the same segment or a corresponding symmetric one to maintain that invariant. The upshot in 1×N domino placement games is that the second player can always force a final state with exactly 1 uncovered square when N is odd.\\n\\nHence, the greatest number of uncovered squares Alice can guarantee (no matter how Bob plays) is 1. She cannot ensure more than 1, because Bob has a mirroring/packing strategy that results in only a single uncovered square, but she can guarantee at least 1 uncovered square by parity alone. Thus the game value (maximin) of uncovered squares is 1.\\n\\nTherefore, the required answer for the second part, after choosing k via the structural minimal multi-term representation (k=2), is that Alice can ensure exactly 1 uncovered square at the end of the game.\",\n  \"answer\": \"1\"\n}",
