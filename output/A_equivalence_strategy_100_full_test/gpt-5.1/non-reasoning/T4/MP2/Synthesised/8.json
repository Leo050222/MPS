Instead of determining all functions satisfying the given equation, simply find $k = f(0) + 1$, where $f(0)$ is the value at zero for any such function $f$ derived from analysis of the functional equation. Find a sequence of maximal length consisting of non-zero integers in which the sum of any seven consecutive terms starting from position $i = k$ onwards is positive and that of any eleven consecutive terms starting from position $i = k$ onwards is negative.",
