Instead of determining all functions from reals to reals that satisfy the given functional equation for all real inputs, simply find $c = f(1)$, where $f(1)$ is the value at input 1 for a solution $f$ to the equation derived from analysis of the equation's structure. Determine all positive integers $k$ such that $\\gcd(k, a_n)=c$ for all $n \\geq c$, where $a_n=2^n+3^n+6^n -c$, $n\\geq 1$.",
