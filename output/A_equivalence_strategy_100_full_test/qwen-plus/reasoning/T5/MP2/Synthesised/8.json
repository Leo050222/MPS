Find all functions $f:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, the integer $f(m)+f(n)-mn$ is nonzero and divides $mf(m)+nf(n)$. Instead of finding all functions from positive integers to positive integers such that for all positive integers $m$ and $n$ a certain nonzero integer divides a related linear combination, simply find $\\kappa = f(1) - 1$, where $f(1)$ is the value at $1$ for any function satisfying the given condition. Does there exist a sequence $ F(1), F(2), F(3), \\ldots$ of non-negative integers that simultaneously satisfies the following three conditions?\n\n(a) Each of the integers greater than or equal to $\\kappa$ occurs in the sequence.\n\n(b) For every positive integer $\\ell$ and every integer $M \\geq \\kappa$, there exists $n > M$ such that $F(n) = \\ell$.\n\n(c) For any $ n \\geq 2,$\n\\[\n F(F(n^{163})) = F(F(n)) + F(F(361)).\n\\]",
