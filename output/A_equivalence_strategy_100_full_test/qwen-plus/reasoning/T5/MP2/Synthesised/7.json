Instead of determining all functions satisfying the given functional equation, simply find $k = p + 1/2$, where $p$ is the coefficient of the quadratic term derived from substituting an assumed quadratic form into the functional equation. Find all polynomials $f$ with real coefficients such that for all reals $a,b,c$ such that $ab+bc+ca = k$ we have the following relations\n\\[ f(a-b) + f(b-c) + f(c-a) = 2f(a+b+c). \\]",
