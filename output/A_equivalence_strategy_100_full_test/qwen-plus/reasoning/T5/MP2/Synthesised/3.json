Let $F(0)=0$, $F(1)=\\frac32$, and $F(n)=\\frac{5}{2}F(n-1)-F(n-2)$\n  for $n\\ge2$.\n\nDetermine whether or not $\\displaystyle{\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\,\\frac{k}{F(2^n)}}$ is a rational number.",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"First, consider the functional inequality $ f(m + n) \\\\geq f(m) + f(f(n)) - 1 $ for all $ m, n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} $. Let $ k = f(1) $. By setting $ m = n = 1 $, we get $ f(2) \\\\geq k + f(k) - 1 $. For $ k \\\\geq 2 $, analyzing the recurrence relation derived from $ n = 1 $ leads to a contradiction, as shown by bounding $ f(k) $ and finding no valid solutions. Thus, $ k = 1 $ is the only possible value for $ f(1) $.\\n\\nNext, define $ F(n) $ with $ F(0) = 0 $, $ F(1) = \\\\frac{3}{2} $, and $ F(n) = \\\\frac{5}{2}F(n-1) - F(n-2) $ for $ n \\\\geq 2 $. Solving the recurrence, the characteristic equation gives roots $ 2 $ and $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $, leading to $ F(n) = 2^n - 2^{-n} $. Therefore, $ F(2^n) = 2^{2^n} - 2^{-2^n} $.\\n\\nThe sum $ \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{k}{F(2^n)} $ with $ k = 1 $ becomes $ \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{2^{2^n} - 2^{-2^n}} $. Simplifying each term as $ \\\\frac{2^{2^n}}{2^{2^{n+1}} - 1} $, we recognize a telescoping series: $ \\\\frac{1}{2^{2^n} - 1} - \\\\frac{1}{2^{2^{n+1}} - 1} $. Summing these terms yields a limit of $ 1 $, which is rational.\",\n    \"answer\": \"Yes\"\n}",
