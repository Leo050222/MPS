Testing constant, linear, quadratic, and quartic polynomials shows that only even-degree polynomials work. For quadratic $ f(x) = ax^2 $, the equation holds as $ \\\\sum (a-b)^2 = 2(a+b+c)^2 $ when $ ab + bc + ca = 0 $. For quartic $ f(x) = bx^4 $, similar symmetric sum analysis confirms the identity. Higher even degrees (e.g., 6) fail for specific values. Linear combinations of $ x^2 $ and $ x^4 $ satisfy the equation due to linearity. Thus, all solutions are $ f(x) = ax^2 + bx^4 $ with real $ a, b $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"f(x) = ax^2 + bx^4 for some real constants a, b\"\n}",
