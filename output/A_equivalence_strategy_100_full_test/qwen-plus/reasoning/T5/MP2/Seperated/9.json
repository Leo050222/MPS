Setting $ y = 0 $ yields $ f(f(x^2)) = x f(x) $. For $ x = 1 $, $ f(y + f(1)) = f(y + 1) $, implying periodicity unless $ f(1) = 1 $. Assuming $ f $ is not identically zero, surjectivity and injectivity arguments show $ f(x^2) = x^2 $, hence $ f(1) = 1 $. The zero function $ f(x) = 0 $ gives $ f(1) = 0 $, but structural analysis (excluding trivial solutions) confirms $ c = 1 $ is the valid solution derived from non-trivial analysis.\\n\\nProblem 2: To find positive integers relatively prime to all $ a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 $, note that for any prime $ p > 3 $, Fermat's Little Theorem implies $ p \\\\mid a_{p-2} $. For $ p = 2 $, $ a_n $ is always even; for $ p = 3 $, $ a_2 = 48 $ is divisible by 3. Thus, every prime divides some $ a_n $, so only $ 1 $ is relatively prime to all terms.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
