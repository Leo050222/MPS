  "math_problem": "Find all ordered triples of primes $(p, q, r)$ such that \\[ p \\mid q^r + 1, \\quad q \\mid r^p + 1, \\quad r \\mid p^q + 1. \\] Instead of finding all ordered triples of primes satisfying the divisibility conditions, simply find $k = r - 2$, where $r$ is the prime for which the multiplicative order of 2 modulo $r$ is 2, derived from the analysis of the conditions. Let $n \\geq 3$ be a fixed integer. The number 1 is written $n$ times on a blackboard. Below the blackboard, there are two buckets that are initially empty. A move consists of erasing two of the numbers $a$ and $b$, replacing them with the numbers 1 and $a+b$, then adding one stone to the first bucket and $\\gcd(a, b)$ stones to the second bucket. After some finite number of moves, there are $s$ stones in the first bucket and $t$ stones in the second bucket, where $s$ and $t$ are positive integers. Find all possible values of the ratio $\\frac{t}{s}$.",
