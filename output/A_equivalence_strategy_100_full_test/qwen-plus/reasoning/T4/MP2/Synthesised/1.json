Instead of determining all such pairs of polynomials, simply find $T$, where $T$ is the constant satisfying $P^{2} + Q^{2} + 1 = P Q T$ derived from the divisibility conditions. Find all positive integers $n$ such that there are $k \\geq T$ positive rational numbers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$ satisfying $a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_k = a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdots a_k = n$.",
