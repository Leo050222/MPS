Find the number of permutations $a_1$, $a_2$, $\\dots a_n$ of the sequence $1$, $2$, $\\dots$ , $n$ satisfying $$a_1 \\le 2a_2\\le 3a_3 \\le \\dots \\le na_n$$. Instead of determining the number of such permutations for general $n$, simply find $k = f(2) - 1$, where $f(2)$ is the number of permutations of length $2$ satisfying the given chain of inequalities. Find all triples of positive integers $(x,y,z)$ that satisfy the equation \n$$2(x+y+z+2xyz)^2=(2xy+2yz+2zx+k)^2+2023.$$",
