This gives $f(1^3 + 0^3 + 1 \\\\cdot 0) = 1^2 f(1) + 0^2 f(0) + f(0)$, simplifying to $f(1) = f(1) + f(0)$. Subtracting $f(1)$ from both sides yields $f(0) = 0$. Thus, $k = 0 + 1 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Consider sequences where the sum of any 7 consecutive terms is positive and any 11 consecutive terms is negative. For $n = 17$, summing all 7-term sums (11 terms) equals summing all 11-term sums (7 terms), leading to a contradiction (positive total vs. negative total). For $n = 16$, construct a sequence like $[-5, -5, 13, -5, -5, -5, 13, -5, -5, 13, -5, -5, -5, 13, -5, -5]$, where every 7-term sum is 1 (positive) and every 11-term sum is -1 (negative). Thus, the maximal length is 16.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"16\"\n}",
