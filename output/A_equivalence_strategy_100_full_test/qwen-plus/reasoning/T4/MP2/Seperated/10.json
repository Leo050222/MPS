Testing small values of a > 1, we find a = 15 is the smallest solution (4*(13)² - 3*(15)² = 676 - 675 = 1). Thus, d = a - 14 = 15 - 14 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Given z⁵ + 2004z = 1, we derive the polynomial for t = z². By eliminating z, we find P(t) = t⁵ + 4008t³ + 2004²t - 1. Calculating P(1) = 2004² + 4008 = 2005² - 1 and P(-1) = -(2005² + 1), the ratio P(1)/P(-1) simplifies to -(2005² - 1)/(2005² + 1) = -2010012/2010013.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-2010012/2010013\"\n}",
