      "A3214": "Alice and Bob play a game on a board consisting of one row of 2022 consecutive squares. They take turns placing tiles that cover two adjacent squares, with Alice going first. By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule. Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends; Bob's goal is to minimize it. What is the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure at the end of the game, no matter how Bob plays?"

Given sum k_i = 5n - 4 and sum 1/k_i = 1, we derive n² - 5n + 4 ≤ 0, so n ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. n=1 is trivial (k₁=1), but structural considerations for minimal non-trivial Egyptian fraction representations (excluding n=1) lead to n=3. The solution for n=3 is k₁=2, k₂=3, k₃=6. The largest part size k=6 gives e = 6 + 2021 = 2027.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a 1xN board with N=2022 (divisible by 3), Alice can ensure one uncovered square per block of 3 squares. Dividing 2022 into 674 blocks of 3, Alice's strategy guarantees 674 uncovered squares regardless of Bob's play.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2027\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"674\"\n}",
