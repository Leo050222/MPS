The recurrence sequence for consistent assignments, where the root does not force uniform values, starts with terms derived from the tree structure. The second term $a_2$ in this recurrence is 5. Thus, $e = a_2 + 2012 = 5 + 2012 = 2017$.\\n\\nProblem 2: The functional equation $f(x)f(y) = f(x-y)$ implies $f(x)^2 = f(0)$ for all $x$. If $f$ is non-zero, $f(0) = 1$ and $f(x) = 1$ for all $x$ (since $f(x) = f(x/2)^2 \\\\geq 0$). The zero function is also a solution. Thus, $f(2017)$ can only be 0 or 1.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2017\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"0,1\"\n}",
