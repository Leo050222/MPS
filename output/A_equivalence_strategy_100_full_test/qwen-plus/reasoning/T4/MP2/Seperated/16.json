Setting $ x = 0 $ gives $ f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)| $. Setting $ x = -y^2 $ yields $ f(0) = f(-y^2) + |y f(y)| $. Combining these, $ f(-y^2) = 2f(0) - f(y^2) $. Assuming $ f $ is constant, only $ f(x) = 0 $ works. For non-constant $ f $, constraints from $ |2f(0) - f(z)| = |f(z)| $ force $ f(0) = 0 $. Thus, $ k = 0 + 4 = 4 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize circles through 4 concyclic points from 7 arbitrary points. Each circle with $ m \\\\geq 4 $ points contributes 1 circle. Three points determine a unique circle, so no two 4-point subsets sharing 3 points can lie on different circles. Total 3-point subsets: $ \\\\binom{7}{3} = 35 $. Each 4-point circle uses $ \\\\binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-point subsets. Maximum circles: $ \\\\lfloor 35 / 4 \\\\rfloor = 8 $. This is achievable with 8 circles each containing exactly 4 points, no five concyclic.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"8\"\n}",
