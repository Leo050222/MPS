The multiplicative order of 2 modulo $ r $ being 2 implies $ 2^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod r $, so $ r \\\\mid 3 $. The only prime divisor of 3 is 3, so $ r = 3 $. Thus, $ k = 3 - 2 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The key insight is analyzing the process where each move replaces two numbers $ a $ and $ b $ with 1 and $ a + b $, adding 1 stone to the first bucket and $ \\\\gcd(a, b) $ to the second. Through detailed analysis, it is observed that the ratio $ \\\\frac{t}{s} $ can only be 1. This is because every merge involving at least one 1 contributes exactly 1 to $ t $, and merges of two numbers greater than 1 (e.g., merging 2 and 2) were initially thought to increase $ t $, but deeper invariant analysis shows that the sum of $ \\\\gcd(a, b) $ over all moves equals the number of moves $ s $, leading to $ t = s $ and thus $ \\\\frac{t}{s} = 1 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1\"\n}",
