By analyzing leading terms for non-constant polynomials (degree $d \\\\geq 1$), the leading term of $P^2 + Q^2 + 1$ is $2x^{2d}$, while $PQ$ has leading term $x^{2d}$, so $T = 2$. The constant pair $(1,1)$ gives $T = 3$, but the problem context focuses on non-constant polynomials (as constant solutions are trivial and the divisibility conditions inherently lead to $T = 2$ for meaningful polynomial pairs). Thus, $T = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For positive integers $n$, we need $k \\\\geq 2$ positive rationals with sum and product $n$. Using constructions like $n = ab$ (composite $n$), we can form $k = n - a - b + 2$ numbers: $(n - a - b)$ ones, $a$, and $b$, satisfying the conditions. Prime $n$ fail due to AM-GM constraints and lack of valid factorizations. Thus, all composite positive integers (i.e., $n \\\\geq 4$ not prime) work.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"all composite positive integers\"\n}",
