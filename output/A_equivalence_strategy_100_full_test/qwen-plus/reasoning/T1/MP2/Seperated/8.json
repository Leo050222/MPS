Possible factor pairs are $(1, 391)$, $(17, 23)$, $(23, 17)$, $(391, 1)$. Since $x > y$ and both are positive integers, test pairs: $x = 23$, $y + 1 = 17$ gives $y = 16$. Check $x = 23 > y = 16$, valid. Thus $k = y + 14 = 16 + 14 = 30$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Initially, 60% of 30 people are men: $0.6 \\\\times 30 = 18$ men. Let $w$ be women entering. Total people becomes $30 + w$. Men must be 40%: $18 = 0.4(30 + w)$. Solve: $18 / 0.4 = 45 = 30 + w$, so $w = 15$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"30\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"15\"\n}",
