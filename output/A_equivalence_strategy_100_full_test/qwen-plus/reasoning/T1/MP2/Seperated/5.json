      "A3077": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$."

Then d = k + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10.\\n\\nProblem 2: Shuxin starts with 10 red, 7 yellow, 3 blue. To have equal remaining candies, the maximum possible remaining count x is 3 (limited by blue). Remaining: 3 each. Eaten: (10-3) + (7-3) + (3-3) = 7 + 4 + 0 = 11. This is minimal since higher x is impossible and lower x increases total eaten.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
