  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The spinner has six regions: four with central angle $x^\\\\circ$, one with $20^\\\\circ$, and one with $140^\\\\circ$. The total central angle of a circle is $360^\\\\circ$, so $4x + 20 + 140 = 360$. Solving gives $4x = 200 \\\\implies x = 50$. Assuming the shaded regions are the four $x^\\\\circ$ regions (as the problem requires finding $\\\\theta$, the total shaded angle, and this is the only way to determine $\\\\theta$ from the given data), $\\\\theta = 4 \\\\times 50 = 200$. Thus, $N = \\\\theta + 2700 = 200 + 2700 = 2900$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Factorize $205800 = 2^3 \\\\cdot 3^1 \\\\cdot 5^2 \\\\cdot 7^3$ and $35k = 5^1 \\\\cdot 7^1 \\\\cdot k$. The gcd must be a perfect square, so exponents in its prime factorization must be even. Analyzing each prime:\\n- For $2$: $\\\\min(3, v_2(k))$ must be even $\\\\implies v_2(k) \\\\in \\\\{0, 2\\\\}$.\\n- For $3$: $\\\\min(1, v_3(k))$ must be even $\\\\implies v_3(k) = 0$.\\n- For $5$: $\\\\min(2, 1 + v_5(k))$ must be even $\\\\implies v_5(k) \\\\geq 1$.\\n- For $7$: $\\\\min(3, 1 + v_7(k))$ must be even $\\\\implies v_7(k) = 1$.\\n- Other primes in $k$ do not affect the gcd (exponent 0, which is even).\\n\\nThus, $k = 2^a \\\\cdot 5^c \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot m$ where $a \\\\in \\\\{0, 2\\\\}$, $c \\\\geq 1$, $m$ coprime to $2, 3, 5, 7$, and $k \\\\leq 2940$. Counting valid combinations:\\n- $a = 0$: $c = 1$ (20 values), $c = 2$ (3 values), $c = 3$ (1 value) $\\\\implies 24$.\\n- $a = 2$: $c = 1$ (5 values), $c = 2$ (1 value) $\\\\implies 6$.\\nTotal: $24 + 6 = 30$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2900\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"30\"\n}",
