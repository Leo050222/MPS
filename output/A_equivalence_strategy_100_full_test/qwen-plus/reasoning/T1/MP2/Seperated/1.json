Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day."

Dividing by 24 hours per day gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 4 (since 24 × 4 = 96 and 100 − 96 = 4). Thus, h = 4. Then k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11.\\n\\nProblem 2: The list is [2, 3, 4, 6]. Checking all combinations of three different numbers:\\n- 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 (not 11)\\n- 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 (valid)\\n- 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 (not 11)\\n- 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 (not 11)\\nThe valid numbers are 2, 3, and 6. Their product is 2 × 3 × 6 = 36.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"36\"\n}",
