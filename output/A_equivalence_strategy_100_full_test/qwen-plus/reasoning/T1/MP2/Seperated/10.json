What would the same MP3 player sell for if it was on sale for $30 \\%$ off of its original price? Instead of computing the sale price under the alternative discount percentage, simply find $k = R - 128$, where $R$ is the original price of the MP3 player determined from the given sale price after the initial discount."

Given the sale price is $112, we solve 0.8R = 112 to find R = 112 / 0.8 = 140. Then k = R - 128 = 140 - 128 = 12.\\n\\nProblem 2: The constant term of (x+m)(x+n) is m*n = -12. Possible integer values for m are the divisors of -12: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±12. Any integer not in this list cannot be m. The value 5 is not a divisor of -12, so it cannot be a value of m.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"12\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"5\"\n}",
