  "math_problem": "Consider the following flowchart: INPUT $\\rightarrow$ Subtract $8 \\rightarrow \\square \\rightarrow$ Divide by $2 \\rightarrow \\square$ Add $16 \\rightarrow$ OUTPUT. If the OUTPUT is 32, what was the INPUT? Instead of determining the initial input value that produces the specified output via the flowchart's sequence of operations, simply find $k = A - 26$, where $A$ is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step. What is the $y$-intercept of the line $y = x + 4$ after it is translated down $k$ units?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"The problem requires finding the y-intercept of the line $ y = x + 4 $ after translating it down $ k $ units, where $ k = A - 26 $ and $ A $ is the intermediate value after the subtraction step in the flowchart. \\n\\n1. **Determine $ A $:**\\n   - The OUTPUT is 32. Working backward through the flowchart:\\n     - Before adding 16: $ 32 - 16 = 16 $ (value at the second square).\\n     - Before dividing by 2: $ 16 \\\\times 2 = 32 $ (value $ A $ at the first square).\\n\\n2. **Calculate $ k $:**\\n   - $ k = A - 26 = 32 - 26 = 6 $.\\n\\n3. **Translate the line:**\\n   - Original line: $ y = x + 4 $ (y-intercept = 4).\\n   - Translating down $ k = 6 $ units subtracts 6 from the y-intercept: $ 4 - 6 = -2 $.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-2\"\n}",
