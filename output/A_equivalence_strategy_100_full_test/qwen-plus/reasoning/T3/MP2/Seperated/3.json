Using $P(10) = 331633$ and $P(-10) = 273373$, we split the problem into even and odd coefficients. Adding $P(10)$ and $P(-10)$ gives $2(a_0 + 100a_2 + 10000a_4 + \\\\cdots) = 605006$, so $a_0 + 100a_2 + 10000a_4 + \\\\cdots = 302503$. Splitting into base 100: $a_0 = 3$, $a_2 = 25$, $a_4 = 30$. Subtracting gives $2(10a_1 + 1000a_3 + \\\\cdots) = 58260$, so $a_1 + 100a_3 + \\\\cdots = 2913$. Splitting into base 100: $a_1 = 13$, $a_3 = 29$. Thus $a_3 = 29$, and $k = 29 - 27 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a primitive Pythagorean triple $(a, b, c)$, parameterize as $a = m^2 - n^2$, $b = 2mn$, $c = m^2 + n^2$ with $m > n$, coprime, not both odd. Compute $\\\\frac{P^2}{A} = \\\\frac{4m(m + n)}{n(m - n)}$. Analyzing integer values, the largest occurs at $m = 5$, $n = 4$ (triple $(9, 40, 41)$), yielding $\\\\frac{P^2}{A} = 45$. Other values (e.g., $m = 3, n = 2$ gives 30; $m = 2, n = 1$ gives 24) are smaller. No larger integer values exist due to constraints on $m$ and $n$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"45\"\n}",
