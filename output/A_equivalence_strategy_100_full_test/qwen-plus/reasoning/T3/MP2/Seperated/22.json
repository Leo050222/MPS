Computing terms reveals a pattern where each prime p appears for a number of terms equal to (next_prime - previous_prime). Tracking the cumulative terms, the 99th term a₉₉ is found to be 53. Thus, k = 53 - 51 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: For 5 lattice points with no three collinear, the minimum number of triangles with area > 1/2 is determined by maximizing the number of triangles with area exactly 1/2 (via Pick's theorem). The maximum number of such triangles is 6 (e.g., unit square plus a point forming two additional area 1/2 triangles), leaving 10 - 6 = 4 triangles with area > 1/2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"4\"\n}",
