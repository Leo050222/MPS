  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Given tetrahedron ABCD with AB=AC=AD=2, volume 1, and BC·CD·DB=16. The altitude AX from A to plane BCD satisfies volume = (1/3)·Area(BCD)·AX = 1 ⇒ Area(BCD) = 3/AX. Using the triangle area formula Area = (a·b·c)/(4R_bcd) where R_bcd is the circumradius of BCD, we get 3/AX = 16/(4R_bcd) ⇒ R_bcd = (4AX)/3. Since AB² = AX² + R_bcd² (as X is the circumcenter of BCD), substituting gives 4 = AX² + (16AX²)/9 ⇒ 25AX²/9 = 4 ⇒ AX = 6/5. Thus δ = AX - 7/10 = 6/5 - 7/10 = 1/2.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of integer pairs (x,y) such that (x+1/2, y+1/2) is inside triangle ABC with vertices (0,0), (200,100), (30,330). Using the formula for half-integer points inside a polygon: Area = I_half + B_half/2. The area of ABC is 31500. Boundary half-integer points: 30 on AC (from parametric equations) and 10 on BC (solving 23x + 17y = 6280), totaling B_half = 40. Thus I_half = 31500 - 40/2 = 31480.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"31480\"\n}",
