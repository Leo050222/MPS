The equation requires a\\u00b2 + b\\u00b2 + c\\u00b2 \\u2261 1 mod 3. This implies exactly two of a, b, c must be 3 (to get 0+0+1 or permutations). Considering the case where a = b = 3, the equation simplifies to 16c\\u00b2 + 17 = 9k\\u00b2. Factoring as (3k - 4c)(3k + 4c) = 17 (prime), the only solution is 3k - 4c = 1 and 3k + 4c = 17, yielding c = 2 (prime). Thus, m = c + 288 = 290.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of trailing zeros in n! is given by \\u230a n/5 \\u230b + \\u230a n/25 \\u230b + \\u230a n/125 \\u230b + \\u230a n/625 \\u230b. Testing values, n = 1170 gives 234 + 46 + 9 + 1 = 290 trailing zeros. Checking smaller n (e.g., 1169) yields 289 zeros, confirming 1170 is minimal.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"290\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1170\"\n}",
