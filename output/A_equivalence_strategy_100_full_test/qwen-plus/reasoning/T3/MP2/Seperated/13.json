Factoring as $(b-a)(b+a) = 1111 = 11 \\\\times 101$, solving gives $a = 45$ (since $a = (101 - 11)/2 = 45$). Then $m = a - 42 = 3$. Problem 2: The divisor $x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6$ factors as $(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$. The remainder $R(x)$ is quadratic. Using $P(1) = -4$, $P(2) = -1$, $P(3) = 4$, solving $R(1) = -4$, $R(2) = -1$, $R(3) = 4$ gives $R(x) = x^2 - 5$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"x^2 - 5\"\n}",
