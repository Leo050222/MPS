      "A1098": "Alice Czarina is bored and is playing a game with a pile of rocks. The pile initially contains 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has $N$ rocks, she removes $k$ of them, where $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, with each possible $k$ having equal probability. Alice Czarina continues until there are no more rocks in the pile. Let $p$ be the probability that the number of rocks left in the pile after each round is a multiple of 5. If $p$ is of the form $5^{a} \\cdot 31^{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $c, d$ are positive integers relatively prime to $5 \\cdot 31$, find $a+b$. Instead of determining $a + b$ for the probability $p$ in the specified form, simply find $m = b + 2$, where $b$ is the exponent of $31$ in that form."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The probability $ p $ that the number of rocks left after each round is a multiple of 5 is analyzed using recurrence relations. The key insight is recognizing the exponent of 31 in the prime factorization of $ p $. The initial number of rocks is 2015 = 5 × 403, where 403 = 13 × 31. By analyzing the product terms in the numerator and denominator, the exponent of 31 in the numerator is 14 (12 terms with 31¹ and 1 term with 31²) and in the denominator (403!) is 13. Thus, $ b = 14 - 13 = 1 $. The problem asks for $ m = b + 2 $, so $ m = 3 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Using the identity for sum of cubes, the system $ x + y + z = 3 $ and $ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 $ reduces to analyzing the cubic polynomial whose roots are $ x, y, z $. The solutions are found by considering cases where variables are equal or distinct. The only solutions with rational entries (and the expected answer in competition problems) are all permutations of $ (1, 1, 1) $ and all permutations of $ (-5, 4, 4) $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"all permutations of (1,1,1) and all permutations of (-5,4,4)\"\n}",
