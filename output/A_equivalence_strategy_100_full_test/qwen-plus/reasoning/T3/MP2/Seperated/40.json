      "A745": "Alice is sitting in a teacup ride with infinitely many layers of spinning disks. The largest disk has radius 5. Each succeeding disk has its center attached to a point on the circumference of the previous disk and has a radius equal to $2 / 3$ of the previous disk. Each disk spins around its center (relative to the disk it is attached to) at a rate of \\pi / 6$ radians per second. Initially, at $t=0$, the centers of the disks are aligned on a single line, going outward. Alice is sitting at the limit point of all these disks. After 12 seconds, what is the length of the trajectory that Alice has traced out? Instead of computing the total path length traversed by the limit point, simply find $k = r - 7$, where $r$ is the radius of the trajectory traced by that limit point."

She performs moves until the number is not positive, and then she stops. Let $N$ be the number of sequences of moves that Melody could perform. Suppose $N=a \\cdot 2^{b}$ where $a$ is an odd positive integer and $b$ is a nonnegative integer. Compute $100 a+b$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The trajectory of Alice is determined by modeling the position as a sum of rotating vectors. Each disk contributes a vector of radius $5 \\\\cdot (2/3)^n$ rotating at angular velocity $(n+1) \\\\omega$ (where $\\\\omega = \\\\pi/6$). The position function is a geometric series leading to $ Z(t) = \\\\frac{15 e^{i \\\\omega t}}{3 - 2 e^{i \\\\omega t}} $. This is a Möbius transformation of the unit circle, mapping it to another circle. By evaluating three points on the trajectory, the circle is found to have center at (6, 0) and radius 9. Thus, $ r = 9 $, so $ k = r - 7 = 2 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Define $ f(n) $ as the number of sequences to reduce $ n $ to non-positive using subtractions of 40 or 41. The recurrence $ f(n) = f(n-40) + f(n-41) $ with $ f(k) = 1 $ for $ k \\\\leq 0 $ applies. For $ n = 770 = 40 \\\\cdot 19 + 10 $, $ f(770) = 2^{19} + \\\\sum_{k=0}^9 \\\\binom{19}{k} $. Using symmetry of binomial coefficients, $ \\\\sum_{k=0}^9 \\\\binom{19}{k} = 2^{18} $. Thus, $ f(770) = 3 \\\\cdot 2^{18} $, giving $ a = 3 $, $ b = 18 $. Therefore, $ 100a + b = 318 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"318\"\n}",
