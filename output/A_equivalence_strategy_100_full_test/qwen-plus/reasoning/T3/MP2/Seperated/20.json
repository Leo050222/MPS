Assuming $m < 0$ and $n > 0$, substitute $m = -k$ ($k > 0$) to get $k^5 + n^5 = 16kn$. Testing small values, $k = 2$ and $n = 2$ satisfies the equation ($32 + 32 = 64 = 16 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 2$), giving the solution pair $(-2, 2)$. Here, $n = 2$ (positive), so $k = n - 1 = 1$.\\n\\nProblem 2: For the polynomial $x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 48$ with roots $p < q < r$, Vieta's formulas give $pqr = 48$. To minimize $\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{2}{q} + \\\\frac{3}{r}$, use Lagrange multipliers with constraint $pqr = 48$. Solving yields $q = 2p$, $r = 3p$, leading to $p = 2$, $q = 4$, $r = 6$.
