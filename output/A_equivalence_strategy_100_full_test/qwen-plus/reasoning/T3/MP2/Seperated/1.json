If each player chooses their roles randomly, what is the probability that each role will have exactly two players? Instead of computing the probability that every role is selected by precisely two players, simply find $e = T(favorable) - 1940$, where $T(favorable)$ is the total number of favorable outcomes where each role receives exactly two choices."

This corresponds to 2-regular bipartite graphs between 5 players and 5 roles. The valid cycle decompositions are a single 10-cycle and a 6-cycle plus a 4-cycle. Calculating these:\\n- 10-cycles: (5-1)! * 5! / 2 = 1440\\n- 6+4 cycles: C(5,3)^2 * 6 * 1 = 600\\nTotal favorable outcomes: 1440 + 600 = 2040. Thus, e = 2040 - 1940 = 100.\\n\\nProblem 2: The function ||k|| is the distance to the nearest square. For m ≥ 1, the interval [m² - m + 1, m² + m] has 2m numbers with total sum m². The average up to n = m(m+1) is (2m+1)/6. Solving for average 100, we find n must be in the m=300 interval (89701–90300). Setting sum(n) = 100n, we solve and find the smallest n is 89800.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"89800\"\n}",
