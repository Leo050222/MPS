By analyzing the linear system, we find that $14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m}$ and $14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m}$, where $m = n + 1$. Using the condition that $n = 2a + 6b$ (the answer to the problem), we derive $7(a + 3b) \\\\equiv 45 \\\\pmod{m}$. Substituting $a + 3b = n/2$ and $m = n + 1$, we solve $7n/2 \\\\equiv 45 \\\\pmod{n + 1}$. Simplifying using modular arithmetic, we find $n + 1$ must divide 97 (a prime), so $m = 97$. Thus, $\\\\ell = m - 95 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: A quadrilateral with an incircle (tangential) requires $AB + CD = BC + DA$, which holds here ($2 + 5 = 3 + 4 = 7$). The radius $r$ of the incircle is $r = K/s$, where $K$ is the area and $s = 7$ is the semiperimeter. The maximum area for a tangential quadrilateral with fixed sides occurs when it is also cyclic (bicentric). Using Brahmagupta's formula, $K = \\\\sqrt{(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CD)(s - DA)} = \\\\sqrt{5 \\\\cdot 4 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 3} = 2\\\\sqrt{30}$. Thus, the maximum radius is $r = 2\\\\sqrt{30}/7$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\\\\sqrt{30}/7\"\n}",
