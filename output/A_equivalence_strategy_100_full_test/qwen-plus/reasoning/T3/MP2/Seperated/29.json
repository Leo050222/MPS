The problem specifies to find $n = r + 2009$ where $r$ is the prime such that $r + 1$ equals the numerator of the subtracted term $\\\\frac{4}{r+1}$. The numerator of $\\\\frac{4}{r+1}$ is 4, so $r + 1 = 4$, giving $r = 3$. Thus, $n = 3 + 2009 = 2012$.\\n\\nProblem 2: FemtoPravis moves diagonally on an $8 \\\\times 8$ toroidal grid. Each step changes coordinates by $(\\\\pm1, \\\\pm1)$. After 2012 steps (even), the walk is on the even sublattice (size $4 \\\\times 4 = 16$ squares). For large $n$, the probability distribution becomes uniform over the 16 reachable squares due to irreducibility and aperiodicity. Thus, the probability of being at the origin is $\\\\frac{1}{16}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2012\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/16\"\n}",
