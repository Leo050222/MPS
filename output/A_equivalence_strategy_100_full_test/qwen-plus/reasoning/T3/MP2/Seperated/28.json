For example, $r(2023)=r\\left(11111100111_{2}\\right)=11100111111_{2}=1855$. Determine, with proof, whether there exists a strictly increasing eight-term arithmetic progression $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{8}$ of odd positive integers such that $r\\left(a_{1}\\right), \\ldots, r\\left(a_{8}\\right)$ is an arithmetic progression in that order. Instead of determining whether such a progression exists, simply find $e = \\delta + 19$, where $\\delta$ is the binary digit in the third of three consecutive terms with equal binary length at the minimal bit position $j \\geq 1$ where the binary representations of the first and second of those terms differ, derived from the arithmetic progression relation among the original terms."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The key is analyzing the arithmetic progression (AP) conditions for both the original and reversed binary sequences. For odd integers in AP, the difference $d$ is even, so the least significant bit (LSB) where the first two terms differ is $j \\\\geq 2$. The minimal $j$ corresponds to the least significant 1 in $d$'s binary. In the original AP, if $a_j = 1$, adding $d$ causes a carry, resulting in bits $1, 0, 1$ at position $j$ for the three terms (Case B). This gives $\\\\delta = 1$, so $e = \\\\delta + 19 = 20$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Subsets $S$ must avoid any non-empty subset sum divisible by 20. Residues modulo 20 must be coprime to 20 (i.e., $\\\\{1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19\\\\}$) to ensure no subset sum is 0 mod 20. Each residue class has 50 elements in $\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, 1000\\\\}$. Choosing 19 elements from one residue class gives $\\\\binom{50}{19}$ subsets per class. With 8 valid residue classes, the total is $8 \\\\times \\\\binom{50}{19} = 283888414880$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"20\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"283888414880\"\n}",
