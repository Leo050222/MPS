In order to feel safe, every duck must either be standing next to at least one cow or between two rabbits. If there are 600 ducks, what is the least number of cows there can be for this to be possible? Instead of determining the minimal number of cows required, simply find $k = r - 198$, where $r$ is the number of rabbits in the arrangement that achieves this minimum."

At R = 200, C = 200, and arrangement is feasible with 200 Type A ducks (R-D-R) and 400 Type B ducks in 200 blocks of D-D separated by cows. Thus, k = 200 - 198 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: The Moser spindle is a 7-point unit distance graph with independence number 2, ensuring every three points have two at unit distance. Configurations for n=8 fail due to independent sets of size 3. Hence, the largest n is 7.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}",
