Let $ s = S(n) $, then the equation becomes $ s(s - 1) = n - 1 $, so $ n = s^2 - s + 1 $. Testing small values of $ s $:\\n- For $ s = 1 $: $ n = 1^2 - 1 + 1 = 1 $. $ S(1) = 1 $, so $ 1(1 - 1) = 0 = 1 - 1 $. This works. \\n- Smaller $ n $ than 1 do not exist (1 is the smallest positive integer). Thus, the smallest $ n $ is 1, $ S(n) = 1 $, so $ k = 1 + 4 = 5 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To maximize the volume of a figure formed by 5 vertices of a unit cube, consider the convex hull of the points $ (0,0,0) $, $ (1,0,0) $, $ (0,1,0) $, $ (0,0,1) $, and $ (1,1,1) $. This forms a polyhedron whose volume is the sum of four tetrahedrons:\\n- Volume of tetrahedron with base $ (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0) $ and apex $ (1,1,1) $: $ 1/6 $\\n- Similarly for the other three bases (each contributing $ 1/6 $)\\n- Volume of tetrahedron with base $ (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) $ and apex $ (1,1,1) $: $ 1/3 $\\nTotal volume: $ 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/2 $.
