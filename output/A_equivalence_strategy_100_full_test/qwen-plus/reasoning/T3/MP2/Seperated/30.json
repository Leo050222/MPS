Factorizing $ 2019 = 3 \\\\times 673 $, both primes. Let $ n = 3^a 673^b m $ with $ m $ coprime to 3 and 673. Since $ n $ is a multiple of 2019, $ a \\\\geq 1 $, $ b \\\\geq 1 $. Using the formula for Euler's totient function, equating $ \\\\varphi(2019n) $ and $ \\\\varphi(n^2) $ leads to the condition $ 3^{a-1} 673^{b-1} m = 1 $. This implies $ a = 1 $, $ b = 1 $, $ m = 1 $, so $ n = 2019 $. Thus, $ \\\\gcd(2019, n) = 2019 $, and $ k = 2019 - 2018 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: The recurrence simplifies to $ (a_{n+1} + 1)(a_{n-1} + 1) = (a_n + 1)^2 $, indicating $ b_n = a_n + 1 $ forms a geometric sequence. Given $ a_1 = 1 $, $ b_1 = 2 $; $ a_9 = 7 $, $ b_9 = 8 $. Solving $ b_9 = b_1 r^8 $ gives $ r^8 = 4 $, so $ r^4 = 2 $. Then $ b_5 = b_1 r^4 = 4 $, hence $ a_5 = 3 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"3\"\n}",
