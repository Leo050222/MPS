  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The equations $x_1(x_1 + 1) = A$ and $x_2(x_2 + 1) = A$ imply $x_1$ and $x_2$ are roots of $t^2 + t - A = 0$, so $x_1 + x_2 = -1$ and $x_1x_2 = -A$. The third equation simplifies using polynomial reduction. Expressing $x^4 + 3x^3 + 5x$ in terms of the quadratic equation $x^2 = -x + A$, we find it reduces to $(7 + A)x + (A^2 - 2A)$. For distinct $x_1 \\\\neq x_2$, the coefficient of $x$ must be zero: $7 + A = 0 \\\\implies A = -7$. Thus, $k = A + 9 = 2$.\\n\\nProblem 2: Factor the denominator as $n(n-1)(n+1)(n+2)$. Using partial fractions, the term decomposes to $\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n-1} - \\\\frac{1}{n} + \\\\frac{1}{n+1} - \\\\frac{1}{n+2}\\\\right)$. Summing from $n=2$ to $17$, the series telescopes. The first part sums to $1 - \\\\frac{1}{17}$ and the second to $\\\\frac{1}{3} - \\\\frac{1}{19}$. Combining gives $\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{16}{17} + \\\\frac{16}{57}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{592}{969}$.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"592/969\"\n}",
