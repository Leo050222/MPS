The condition requires no subset of $ S $ to sum to 10. After checking all 16 possible $ A $, 9 subsets satisfy the condition. Thus $ N_5 = 9 $, and $ k = N_5 - 8 = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: We solve $ (ab+1)(bc+1)(ca+1) = 84 $ for nonnegative integers $ (a,b,c) $. Solutions arise from two cases: (1) one variable is 0 (leading to 6 solutions where the other two multiply to 83, a prime), and (2) all variables are positive (leading to permutations of $ (1,2,3) $, giving 6 solutions). Total solutions: 12.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
