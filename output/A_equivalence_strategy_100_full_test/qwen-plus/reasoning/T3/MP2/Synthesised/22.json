Instead of determining the 100th term of the sequence, simply find $k = a_{99} - 51$, where $a_{99}$ is the 99th term of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$. If 5 points are placed in $\\mathbb{Z}^k$ at lattice points (i.e. points $(x_1, \\dots, x_k)$ where $x_1, \\dots, x_k$ are all integers) such that no three are collinear, then there are 10 triangles whose vertices are among these points. What is the minimum possible number of these triangles that have area greater than $1 / 2$ ?",
