Find all positive integers $n$ for which $\\varphi(2019 n)=\\varphi\\left(n^{2}\\right)$. Instead of finding all positive integers $n$ for which $\\varphi(2019 n)=\\varphi(n^2)$, simply find $k=\\gcd(2019,n)-2018$, where $n$ is the positive integer solution that is a multiple of $2019$. The sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$ of real numbers satisfies the recurrence $a_{n+1}=\\frac{a_{n}^{2}-a_{n-1}+2 a_{n}}{a_{n-1}+k}$. Given that $a_{1}=k$ and $a_{9}=7$, find $a_{5}$.",
