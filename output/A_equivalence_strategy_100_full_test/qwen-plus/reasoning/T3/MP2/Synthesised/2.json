Instead of determining the value of $n$, simply find $\\ell = m - 95$, where $m = n + 1$ is the common modulus in the given system of congruences. Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral with side lengths $AB=\\ell$, $BC=3$, $CD=5$, and $DA=4$. What is the maximum possible radius of a circle inscribed in quadrilateral $ABCD$?",
