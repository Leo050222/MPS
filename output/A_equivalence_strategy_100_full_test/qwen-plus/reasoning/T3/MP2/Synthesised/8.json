  "math_problem": "Find two lines of symmetry of the graph of the function $y=x+\\frac{1}{x}$. Express your answer as two equations of the form $y=a x+b$. Instead of determining the equations of the lines of symmetry, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector in the equation of the asymptote parallel to the y-axis, derived from the asymptotic analysis of the curve. Determine all triplets of real numbers $(x, y, z)$ satisfying the system of equations $x^{2} y+y^{2} z =k+1039$, $x^{2} z+z^{2} y =260$, $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) =-540$.",
