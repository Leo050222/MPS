  "math_problem": "Tetrahedron $A B C D$ with volume 1 is inscribed in circumsphere $\\omega$ such that $A B=A C=A D=2$ and $B C \\cdot C D \\cdot D B=16$. Find the radius of $\\omega$. Instead of determining the circumradius of the sphere containing all four vertices, simply find $\\delta = AX - \\frac{7}{10}$, where $AX$ is the altitude from vertex $A$ to the plane of face $BCD$. In the Cartesian plane, let $A=(0,0)$, $B=(200,100)$, and $C=(30,330)$. Compute the number of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of integers so that $\\left(x+\\delta, y+\\delta\\right)$ is in the interior of triangle $A B C$.",
