  "math_problem": "You have a twig of length 1. You repeatedly do the following: select two points on the twig independently and uniformly at random, make cuts on these two points, and keep only the largest piece. After 2012 repetitions, what is the expected length of the remaining piece? Instead of computing the expected remaining length after many such cutting operations, simply find $k = a_1 + \\frac{133}{18}$, where $a_1$ is the expected length of the longest piece obtained from a unit-length twig in a single operation of selecting two uniform random points, cutting, and retaining the largest segment. Kevin starts with the vectors $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ and at each time step, he replaces one of the vectors with their sum. Find the cotangent of the minimum possible angle between the vectors after $k$ time steps.",
