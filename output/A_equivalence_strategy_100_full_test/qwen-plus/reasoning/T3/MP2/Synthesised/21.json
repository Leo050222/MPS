Prove the inequality\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{a^3+8}+\\frac{b}{b^3+8}+\\frac{c}{c^3+8}+\\frac{d}{d^3+8}\\le\\frac{4}{9}\n\\] Instead of proving the inequality for the sum of the function values over the non-negative reals summing to 4, simply find $k = p(1) + 1$, where $p(x)$ is the numerator polynomial in the scaled difference between the tangent line approximation to the function $f(t) = t / (t^3 + 8)$ at $t=1$ and the function itself, derived from the analysis of the approximation's validity. Let $x, y, n$ be positive integers with $n > k$. How many ordered triples $(x, y, n)$ of solutions are there to the equation $x^{n}-y^{n}=2^{100}$ ?",
