  "math_problem": "For any odd positive integer $n$, let $r(n)$ be the odd positive integer such that the binary representation of $r(n)$ is the binary representation of $n$ written backwards. For example, $r(2023)=r\\left(11111100111_{2}\\right)=11100111111_{2}=1855$. Determine, with proof, whether there exists a strictly increasing eight-term arithmetic progression $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{8}$ of odd positive integers such that $r\\left(a_{1}\\right), \\ldots, r\\left(a_{8}\\right)$ is an arithmetic progression in that order. Instead of determining whether such a progression exists, simply find $\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is the binary digit in the third of three consecutive terms with equal binary length at the minimal bit position $j \\geq 1$ where the binary representations of the first and second of those terms differ, derived from the arithmetic progression relation among the original terms. Determine the number of subsets $S$ of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 1000\\}$ that satisfy the following conditions: - $S$ has $\\delta + 19$ elements, and - the sum of the elements in any non-empty subset of $S$ is not divisible by 20.",
