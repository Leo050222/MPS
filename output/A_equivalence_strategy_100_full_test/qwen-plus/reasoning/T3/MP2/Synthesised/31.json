  "math_problem": "Farmer Bill's 1000 animals - ducks, cows, and rabbits - are standing in a circle. In order to feel safe, every duck must either be standing next to at least one cow or between two rabbits. If there are 600 ducks, what is the least number of cows there can be for this to be possible? Instead of determining the minimal number of cows required, simply find $k = r - 198$, where $r$ is the number of rabbits in the arrangement that achieves this minimum. Find the largest integer $n$ such that the following holds: there exists a set of $n$ points in the plane such that, for any choice of three of them, some two are distance $k$ apart.",
