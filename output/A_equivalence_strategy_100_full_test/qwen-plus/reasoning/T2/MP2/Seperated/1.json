  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: To determine f(37), note that 37 is a prime number. It is not perfect (sum of proper divisors is 1 ≠ 37) and does not end in 4. However, 74 = 2 × 37 ends in 4, so f(74) = 0. By additivity, f(74) = f(2) + f(37). Since 4 ends in 4, f(4) = 0, and 4 = 2 × 2 implies f(4) = 2f(2) = 0 ⇒ f(2) = 0. Thus, 0 = 0 + f(37) ⇒ f(37) = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: The number of paths from (0,0) to (4,4) staying on or below y = x is the 4th Catalan number. Using the formula Cₙ = (1/(n+1))C(2n, n), for n=4: C₄ = (1/5) × 70 = 14. Alternatively, total unrestricted paths C(8,4)=70 minus invalid paths C(8,3)=56 gives 14.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"14\"\n}",
