Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let width = w, length = 3w. Perimeter = 2(w + 3w) = 8w. Area = w * 3w = 3w². Set equal: 8w = 3w² ⇒ 3w² - 8w = 0 ⇒ w(3w - 8) = 0 ⇒ w = 8/3 (since w > 0). Compute d = w + 37/3 = 8/3 + 37/3 = 45/3 = 15.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let ladder length = L. Initial position: base = 15 ft, height = h ⇒ L² = 15² + h². After moving: base = 24 ft, height = h - 13 ⇒ L² = 24² + (h - 13)². Equate: 225 + h² = 576 + h² - 26h + 169 ⇒ 225 = 745 - 26h ⇒ 26h = 520 ⇒ h = 20. Then L = √(15² + 20²) = √625 = 25.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"15\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"25\"\n}",
