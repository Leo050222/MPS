In each pair, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is knocked out of the tournament. The probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other during the tournament is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of evaluating the specified linear combination of the numerator and denominator representing the probability that the two designated players meet during the tournament, simply find $e = b - 16$, where $b$ is the denominator of that probability when expressed as a reduced fraction."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: In a knockout tournament with 32 players, the probability that two specific players (Ava and Tiffany) meet is determined by symmetry. The total number of matches is 31, and there are C(32, 2) = 496 possible pairs. By symmetry, each pair has an equal probability of meeting, so the probability is (31) / (496) = 1/16. The reduced fraction has denominator b = 16. Thus, e = b - 16 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: For very small x > 0, expand (1 + x)^10 using the binomial theorem. The numerator 1 - (1 + x)^10 ≈ -10x and the denominator 1 + (1 + x)^10 ≈ 2. Thus, the fraction ≈ -5x. Multiplying by x^p gives -5x^{p+1}. For this to approach a constant c as x → 0+, set p + 1 = 0 ⇒ p = -1. Then the expression approaches -5, so c = -5. The ordered pair is (-1, -5).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(-1, -5)\"\n}",
