With two diameters creating four sectors (two pairs of equal angles), splitting one sector with a radius leads to five sectors. By symmetry, setting the smallest sectors equal, we find the maximum minimal fraction is 1/6. The denominator is 6, so k = 6 + 4 = 10.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need the smallest integer >10 where base 10 and base 17 digit sums are equal. Checking sequentially, n=153 in base 10 has digit sum 9, and in base 17 (90) also sums to 9. No smaller number meets the criteria.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"153\"\n}",
