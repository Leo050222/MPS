Squaring both sides gives $15 + \\\\sqrt{216} = x + y + 2\\\\sqrt{xy}$. Equating rational and irrational parts: $x + y = 15$ and $2\\\\sqrt{xy} = \\\\sqrt{216} = 6\\\\sqrt{6}$. Simplifying, $\\\\sqrt{xy} = 3\\\\sqrt{6}$ so $xy = 54$. Solving $x + y = 15$ and $xy = 54$, we find $x = 9$, $y = 6$ (or vice versa). Thus, $\\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}} = 3 + \\\\sqrt{6}$, so $a = 3$, $b = 6$. Then $k = a + 3 = 6$.\\n\\nProblem 2: This is a modified coupon collector problem where the die cannot roll the same number twice in a row. Let $E_k$ be the expected rolls to collect all 6 numbers starting from $k$ distinct numbers. Using recurrence relations, $E_k = E_{k+1} + \\\\frac{5}{6 - k}$ for $k = 1$ to $5$, with $E_6 = 0$. Calculating step-by-step: $E_5 = 5$, $E_4 = 5 + \\\\frac{5}{2} = \\\\frac{15}{2}$, $E_3 = \\\\frac{15}{2} + \\\\frac{5}{3} = \\\\frac{55}{6}$, $E_2 = \\\\frac{55}{6} + \\\\frac{5}{4} = \\\\frac{125}{12}$, $E_1 = \\\\frac{125}{12} + 1 = \\\\frac{137}{12}$.
