After 80 balls are moved from Box $A$ to Box $B$, the ratio of balls in Box $A$ to Box $B$ is now $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are positive integers with $\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1$. Find $100p+q$. Instead of computing the encoding of the simplified ratio via one hundred times its numerator plus its denominator, simply find $k = g + 3$, where $g$ is the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of that simplified ratio."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let n be the answer. Box B starts with n balls, Box A with n/2. After moving 80 balls, Box A has (n/2 - 80), Box B has (n + 80). The ratio is (n/2 - 80)/(n + 80) = (n - 160)/(2(n + 80)). This ratio simplifies to p/q where gcd(p, q) = 1. Since p and q are coprime, g = 1. Thus, k = g + 3 = 4. The value of n must ensure valid ball counts (n > 160), but k is always 4 regardless of n.\\n\\nProblem 2: The trapezoid has vertices A(0,0), B(5,0), C(4,4), D(0,4). Midpoints: M1(2.5,0), M2(4.5,2), M3(2,4), M4(0,2). Connecting midpoints of opposite sides gives two segments: y=2 and y=-8x+20, intersecting at (2.25,2). Using shoelace formula, regions have areas 19/4 (two regions) and 17/4 (two regions). Largest area - smallest area = 1/2. Thus, 240d = 120.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"120\"\n}",
