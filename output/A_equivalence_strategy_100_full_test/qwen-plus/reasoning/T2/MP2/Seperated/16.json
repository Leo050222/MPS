(Rotations and reflections are considered different.) Instead of counting the total number of valid placements satisfying the row, column, and corner avoidance conditions, simply find $s = m - 4$, where $m$ is the number of columns available for the intermediate rows after assigning columns to the boundary rows under the given constraints."

In a move, Sally can move to a point in the lattice exactly one unit away. Given that Sally starts at $(2,1)$, compute the number of possible paths Sally can take."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The chessboard has 8 rows and columns. The boundary rows (1 and 8) cannot use columns 1 or 8 (corners). Assigning columns to these rows uses 2 distinct columns from 2-7 (6 choices for row 1, 5 for row 8). The intermediate rows (2-7) then have 8 - 2 = 6 columns available. Thus, m = 6, so s = m - 4 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a 3×n grid, starting at (2,1), the only Hamiltonian paths are the two snake-like paths (up-first and down-first), which are forced due to the grid's narrow width. This holds for any n ≥ 1, including n = 24. Hence, the number of paths is 2.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\"\n}",
