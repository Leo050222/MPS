For a 7-gon (n=7), this is the 5th Catalan number, C₅ = 42. Thus τ = 42. Calculating k = τ - 41 gives 42 - 41 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let the product of two consecutive natural numbers be n(n+1) and the product of two consecutive even natural numbers be 2m(2m+2) = 4m(m+1). Setting n(n+1) = 4m(m+1) leads to the equation (2n+1)² - (4m+2)² = -3, which factors as a difference of squares. The only positive integer factorization of 3 yields no valid natural number solutions for m and n. Checking small values and modular arithmetic (n(n+1) mod 4 must be 0 or 2, while 4m(m+1) is 0 mod 4) confirms no solutions exist. Thus, the answer is no.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"No\"\n}",
