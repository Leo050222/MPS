First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill 11. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?"

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The system of equations is solved by expressing variables in terms of x. Subtracting the first two equations gives (z - y)(x - 1) = 11. Using the third equation, we express y + z = 19 - x. Solving for y and z in terms of x and substituting back leads to the quadratic equation x² - 18x + 72 = 0, with roots x = 12 and x = 6. For x = 6 (smaller root for x + 1, which is 7), z = 38/5. Thus, k = z + 17/5 = 38/5 + 17/5 = 55/5 = 11.\\n\\nProblem 2: Alice (skill 11) plays against all 10 players with higher skill (12-21) and against each lower skill player (1-10) with probability 1/(10 + 1) = 1/11.
