Thus, the expression simplifies to $ n + \\\\frac{-7n + 3}{n^2 + 7} $. For this to be an integer, $ n^2 + 7 $ must divide $ -7n + 3 $. This implies $ n^2 + 7 \\\\leq | -7n + 3 | $, leading to $ n^2 - 7n + 10 \\\\leq 0 $, which holds for $ n = 2, 3, 4, 5 $. Testing these values shows only $ n = 2 $ and $ n = 5 $ work. For $ n = 2 $, the expression equals 1; for $ n = 5 $, it equals 4. The problem states $ n = \\\\text{expression value} + k $. Solving $ 2 = 1 + k $ and $ 5 = 4 + k $ gives $ k = 1 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: Let the roots of $ 2x^2 - mx - 8 $ be $ \\\\alpha $ and $ \\\\beta $. The difference of roots is $ |\\\\alpha - \\\\beta| = \\\\sqrt{(\\\\alpha + \\\\beta)^2 - 4\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16} $. Setting this equal to $ m - 1 $ (since difference is non-negative, $ m \\\\geq 1 $), squaring both sides gives $ \\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16 = (m - 1)^2 $. Solving yields $ 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0 $, with solutions $ m = 6 $ and $ m = -\\\\frac{10}{3} $. Only $ m = 6 $ satisfies $ m \\\\geq 1 $, verified by checking the roots' difference.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
