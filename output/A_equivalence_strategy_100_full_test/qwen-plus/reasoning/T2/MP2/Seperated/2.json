      "A3322": "A rubber band is 4 inches long. An ant begins at the left end. Every minute, the ant walks one inch along rightwards along the rubber band, but then the band is stretched (uniformly) by one inch. For what value of $n$ will the ant reach the right end during the $n$th minute? Instead of determining the minute during which the ant reaches the right end, simply find $e = p + \\frac{23}{4}$, where $p$ is the portion of the rubber band's length traversed by the ant during the first minute accounting for the uniform stretch."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The ant walks 1 inch on a 4-inch rubber band during the first minute, covering 1/4 of the band's length. Stretching uniformly preserves the fraction traversed, so p = 1/4. Thus, e = 1/4 + 23/4 = 24/4 = 6.\\n\\nProblem 2: For six students in a row, permutations where no student has to pass correspond to those where every element is a prefix or suffix maximum. There are 2^(6-1) = 32 such permutations. Total permutations = 720. Probability no one passes = 32/720 = 2/45. Thus, probability someone passes = 1 - 2/45 = 43/45.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"43/45\"\n}",
