Let $p_{N}$ denote the probability that the product of these two integers has a units digit of 0. The maximum possible value of $p_{N}$ over all possible choices of $N$ can be written as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing one hundred times the numerator plus the denominator when the maximum possible value of $p_N$ is expressed as a reduced fraction, simply find $e = \\left(k + \\frac{1973}{100}\\right)$, where $k$ is the maximum possible value of $p_N$ derived from the upper bound analysis of the probability."

For such $ N $, the proportion of even numbers is $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $, multiples of 5 is $ \\\\frac{1}{5} $, and numbers neither even nor multiples of 5 is $ \\\\frac{2}{5} $. Calculating $ p_N $: $$ p_N = 1 - \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)^2 - \\\\left(\\\\frac{4}{5}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{5}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{27}{100}. $$ Thus, $ k = \\\\frac{27}{100} $. Then $ e = k + \\\\frac{1973}{100} = \\\\frac{27}{100} + \\\\frac{1973}{100} = \\\\frac{2000}{100} = 20 $.\\n\\nProblem 2: To have $ a \\\\times b \\\\times c $ divisible by 20, the product must include at least one factor of 5 (so at least one of $ a, b, c $ is 5) and at least two factors of 2. Counting valid triplets:\\n- Total triplets with at least one 5: $ 9^3 - 8^3 = 217 $.\\n- Subtract triplets with insufficient factors of 2:\\n  - Total v2 = 0 (all odd, including at least one 5): $ 5^3 - 4^3 = 61 $.\\n  - Total v2 = 1 (exactly one number with v2=1, others odd with at least one 5): $ 3 \\\\times 2 \\\\times (5^2 - 4^2) = 54 $.\\n- Valid triplets: $ 217 - 61 - 54 = 102 $.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"20\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"102\"\n}",
