She wants to eat six pieces of sushi arranged in a $2 \\times 3$ rectangular grid, but sushi is sticky, and Wendy can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to (not counting diagonally) at most two other pieces. In how many orders can Wendy eat the six pieces of sushi, assuming that the pieces of sushi are distinguishable? Instead of counting the total number of valid eating orders for the six distinguishable pieces, simply find $k = \\deg(F) + 0$, where $\\deg(F)$ is the degree of the bottom-right piece $F$ in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row."

After eating the top row endpoints A and C, the remaining pieces are B, D, E, F. The induced subgraph adjacencies are B-E, D-E, and E-F. Thus, F is only adjacent to E, giving deg(F) = 1. Therefore, k = 1 + 0 = 1.\\n\\nProblem 2: For a, b ∈ [0,1], the conditions for an obtuse triangle with sides a, b, 1 require 1 to be the longest side (always true here), triangle inequality a + b > 1, and obtuse condition a² + b² < 1. The valid region is the area inside the unit circle quadrant (area π/4) minus the triangle under a + b = 1 (area 1/2), resulting in (π - 2)/4.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(π - 2)/4\"\n}",
