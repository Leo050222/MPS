      "A1433": "During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{3}, z^{5}, z^{7}, \\ldots, z^{2013}$, in that order; on Sunday, he begins at 1 and delivers milk to houses located at $z^{2}, z^{4}, z^{6}, \\ldots, z^{2012}$, in that order. Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^{2}$. Instead of determining the real part of the square of the starting point, simply find $k = |z| - 1$, where $|z|$ is the modulus of the starting point derived from the equality of the total path lengths on both days."

The ID number satisfies the following property: the first two digits is a number divisible by 2, the first three digits is a number divisible by 3, etc. so that the ID number itself is divisible by 6. One ID number that satisfies this condition is 123252. How many different possibilities are there for Bob's ID number?"

For Saturday, the path length is |z² - 1| * r * (r^{2012} - 1)/(r² - 1), and for Sunday, it's |z² - 1| * (r^{2012} - 1)/(r² - 1), where r = |z|. Setting them equal gives r = 1, so k = |z| - 1 = 0.\\n\\nProblem 2: The ID number must satisfy divisibility conditions for each prefix. Key steps:\\n- d2, d6: 4 even choices each.\\n- d3: 3 choices to make sum divisible by 3.\\n- d4: 2 choices for divisibility by 4.\\n- d5: must be 5 (1 choice).\\n- For each (d1,d2,d3), the valid (d4,d6) pairs total 3 due to modular constraints. Total count: 9 (d1) * 4 (d2) * 3 (d3) * 3 (d4,d6) * 1 (d5) = 324.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"324\"\n}",
