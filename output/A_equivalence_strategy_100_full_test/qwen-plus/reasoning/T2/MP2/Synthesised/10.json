  "math_problem": "$a$ and $b$ are integers such that $a+\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{15+\\sqrt{216}}$. Compute $a / b$. Instead of computing the ratio of the integer coefficient to the radicand in the denested form of the nested radical, simply find $k = a + 3$, where $a$ is the integer coefficient in that denested form. Mark has a cursed $k$-sided die that never rolls the same number twice in a row, and all other outcomes are equally likely. Compute the expected number of rolls it takes for Mark to roll every number at least once.",
