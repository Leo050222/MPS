So we only need to compute $ \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} f_n(0) $, then add 3.\\n\\nLet’s compute the first few $ f_n(0) $.\\n\\nGiven: $ f_1(x) = 1 $ for all $ x $, so $ f_1(0) = 1 $.\\n\\nNow, consider $ f_2 $. The recurrence says:\\n\\n$ f_2' = f_1 f_2 = 1 \\\\cdot f_2 = f_2 $, so $ f_2' = f_2 $, with $ f_2(0) = 1 $.\\n\\nThis is a standard ODE: solution is $ f_2(x) = e^x $. So $ f_2(0) = 1 $.\\n\\nNext, $ f_3' = f_2 f_3 = e^x f_3 $, with $ f_3(0) = 1 $.\\n\\nSo $ \\\\frac{d}{dx} f_3 = e^x f_3 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{f_3'}{f_3} = e^x \\\\Rightarrow \\\\ln|f_3| = e^x + C $\\n\\nAt $ x=0 $: $ \\\\ln f_3(0) = e^0 + C = 1 + C \\\\Rightarrow \\\\ln 1 = 0 = 1 + C \\\\Rightarrow C = -1 $\\n\\nSo $ \\\\ln f_3(x) = e^x - 1 \\\\Rightarrow f_3(x) = \\\\exp(e^x - 1) $, so $ f_3(0) = \\\\exp(1 - 1) = e^0 = 1 $.\\n\\nNow $ f_4' = f_3 f_4 = \\\\exp(e^x - 1) f_4 $\\n\\nSo $ \\\\frac{f_4'}{f_4} = \\\\exp(e^x - 1) \\\\Rightarrow \\\\ln f_4(x) = \\\\int_0^x \\\\exp(e^t - 1) dt + C $\\n\\nAt $ x=0 $, $ f_4(0)=1 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\ln 1 = 0 = C $, so $ \\\\ln f_4(x) = \\\\int_0^x \\\\exp(e^t - 1) dt $\\n\\nBut we only care about $ f_4(0) = 1 $.\\n\\nObservation: All functions satisfy $ f_n(0) = 1 $.

(±4,±4) — but signs independent, so 4 points: (4,4),(4,-4),(-4,4),(-4,-4)\\nx=±5: 25+y^2=32 → y^2=7, no\\nx=±6: 36>32\\nSo only (±4,±4) — four points\\n\\nSo it seems for each k, the circle x^2+y^2=2^k has exactly four integer points?\\n\\nBut wait: k=0: 1: (±1,0),(0,±1) — that's four points\\nk=1: 2: (±1,±1) — four points\\nk=2: 4: (±2,0),(0,±2) — four points\\nk=3: 8: (±2,±2) — four points\\nk=4: 16: (±4,0),(0,±4) — four points\\nk=5: 32: (±4,±4) — four points\\nk=6: 64: ?\\nx^2+y^2=64\\nPossibilities:\\n- (±8,0), (0,±8)\\n- (±4,±√48)? no\\n- x=±4: 16+y^2=64 → y^2=48, no\\nx=±2: 4+y^2=64 → y^2=60, no\\nx=±6: 36+y^2=64 → y^2=28, no\\nx=±7: 49+y^2=64 → y^2=15, no\\nx=±5: 25+y^2=64 → y^2=39, no\\nx=±3: 9+y^2=64 → y^2=55, no\\nx=±1: 1+y^2=64 → y^2=63, no\\nSo only (±8,0),(0,±8) — four points\\n\\nBut wait: 8^2 + 0^2 =64, yes\\nIs there (±4,±4√3)? no\\nBut 64 = 8^2 + 0^2, or 0^2+8^2, same\\nOr 4^2 + (4√3)^2? not integer\\nBut also: 64 = 4^2 + (4√3)^2? no\\nWait: 64 = 0^2 + 8^2, etc.\\nBut also: 64 = 4^2 + (4√3)^2? not integer\\nBut 64 = 8^2 + 0^2, or 4^2 + (4√3)^2? no\\nWait: is there (a,b) with a^2+b^2=64, a,b integers, not axis-aligned?\\nFor example, (±4,±√48)? √48 not int\\n(±6,±√(64-36)=√28)? no\\n(±7,±√15)? no\\n(±5,±√39)? no\\nSo only axis-aligned: (±8,0),(0,±8) — four points\\n\\nBut earlier k=3: 8: (±2,±2) — diagonal\\nSo pattern: when k even, say k=2m, then 2^{2m} = (2^m)^2, so points (±2^m, 0), (0, ±2^m) — four points\\nWhen k odd, k=2m+1, 2^{2m+1} = 2 * 4^m = (2^m)^2 + (2^m)^2, so (±2^m, ±2^m) — but signs independent? Each coordinate independently signed, so four points: (2^m,2^m), (2^m,-2^m), (-2^m,2^m), (-2^m,-2^m)\\n\\nCheck:\\nk=0 (even): m=0, 2^0=1, points (±1,0),(0,±1) — yes\\nk=1 (odd): m=0, 2^0=1, points (±1,±1) — yes\\nk=2 (even): m=1, 2^1=2, points (±2,0),(0,±2) — yes\\nk=3 (odd): m=1, 2^1=2, points (±2,±2) — yes\\nk=4 (even): m=2, 2^2=4, points (±4,0),(0,±4) — yes\\nk=5 (odd): m=2, 2^2=4, points (±4,±4) — yes\\nk=6 (even): m=3, 2^3=8, points (±8,0),(0,±8) — yes\\nPerfect.\\n\\nSo for each k ≥ 0, the set S_k = { (x,y) ∈ ℤ² : x² + y² = 2^k } has exactly four points:\\n\\n- If k even, k=2m: (±2^m, 0), (0, ±2^m)\\n- If k odd, k=2m+1: (±2^m, ±2^m) — with independent signs\\n\\nAdditionally, P_n includes (0,0) and all S_k for k=0 to n.\\n\\nNow, we want to count the number of 4-element subsets of P_n that are vertices of a square.\\n\\nNote: The square must have four distinct points, and they form a square.\\n\\nPossible types of squares in ℤ²:\\n\\n1. Axis-aligned squares\\n2. Rotated squares (e.g., diamond-shaped, or 45 degrees)\\n\\nBut in this case, the points are sparse.\\n\\nFirst, note that (0,0) is included.\\n\\nLet’s see if we can find squares.\\n\\nIdea: Perhaps the only squares are those centered at origin, with vertices on the circles.\\n\\nFor example, consider k even: S_k consists of points on axes.\\nS_k for k even: (±a,0), (0,±a) with a=2^m\\nThese four points: do they form a square?\\nPlot: (a,0), (-a,0), (0,a), (0,-a)\\nDistance between (a,0) and (0,a): √[(a-0)^2 + (0-a)^2] = √(a² + a²) = √(2a²) = a√2\\nSimilarly, all adjacent? But these four points are not connected as a square; actually, they form a square rotated 45 degrees!\\nIndeed: the points (a,0), (0,a), (-a,0), (0,-a) — in order, they form a square with side length a√2, rotated 45 degrees, centered at origin.\\nYes! For example, a=1: (1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1) — this is a square rotated 45 degrees, side length √2.\\nSimilarly for any a.\\nSo for each even k=2m, the four points of S_k form a square.\\nSimilarly, for odd k=2m+1: points (±b,±b) with b=2^m\\nSo (b,b), (b,-b), (-b,b), (-b,-b)\\nThese are the four points at corners of a square, axis-aligned? Distance between (b,b) and (b,-b): √[0 + (2b)^2] = 2b, but that's vertical distance.\\nBut (b,b) to (b,-b) is not an edge; actually, these four points: they form a square rotated 45 degrees? Let's see.\\nPoints: (b,b), (b,-b), (-b,b), (-b,-b)\\nDistance between (b,b) and (b,-b): |b - (-b)| in y, same x, so distance 2b\\nBetween (b,b) and (-b,b): distance 2b in x\\nBut angle: from (b,b) to (b,-b) is down, to (-b,b) is left, but not adjacent in a square.\\nActually, these four points are the vertices of an axis-aligned square? No: (b,b) and (b,-b) have same x, different y, but (b,-b) and (-b,-b) have same y, etc.\\nIn fact, they form a rectangle, but is it a square?\\nPlot: (b,b), (b,-b), (-b,-b), (-b,b)\\nThis is a square! With sides parallel to axes? From (b,b) to (b,-b): that's vertical side of length |b - (-b)| = 2b\\nFrom (b,-b) to (-b,-b): horizontal side of length 2b\\nYes! So it's an axis-aligned square with side length 2b, centered at origin.\\nFor example, b=1: (1,1),(1,-1),(-1,-1),(-1,1) — yes, square of side 2, axis-aligned.\\nSo for each odd k=2m+1, with b=2^m, the four points form an axis-aligned square of side 2b = 2^{m+1}\\n\\nBut also, for even k=2m, a=2^m, the four points (±a,0),(0,±a) form a square rotated 45 degrees, with \\\"radius\\\" a, and side length a√2\\n\\nMoreover, are there other squares?\\n\\nFor example, could there be squares not centered at origin?\\nOr squares using (0,0)?\\n\\nFirst, let's list all such obvious squares.\\n\\nFor each k from 0 to n, the set S_k has four points that form a square.\\n- If k even: rotated square (diamond)\\n- If k odd: axis-aligned square\\nIn both cases, the four points of S_k form a square.\\nAnd since S_k ⊂ P_n for k ≤ n, and they are four distinct points, each such S_k gives one 4-point subset that is a square.\\nMoreover, are there more?\\n\\nCould there be squares that use points from different S_k or include (0,0)?\\n\\nFirst, consider (0,0). Can (0,0) be a vertex of a square with three other points in P_n?\\nSuppose we have a square with vertices including (0,0).\\nSince the square is in ℤ², and symmetric, but (0,0) is special.\\nSuppose (0,0) is a vertex. Then the adjacent vertices would be at vectors (a,b), and the fourth vertex at (a+c,b+d), but standard: if (0,0) and (a,b) are adjacent, and the square turns 90 degrees, then next vertex is (a-b, a+b)? Vector from (0,0) to (a,b), rotate 90 deg CCW: (-b,a), so next vertex is (a,b) + (-b,a) = (a-b, b+a)? Standard: if two adjacent vertices from origin: v and w, with w = rotation of v by 90 deg.\\nSo if (0,0), (a,b), then next could be (a,b) + (-b,a) = (a-b, a+b), then back to (-b,a), but to close, from (a-b,a+b) to (-b,a): difference (-b - (a-b), a - (a+b)) = (-a, -b), not consistent.\\nBetter: vertices: A=(0,0), B=(a,b), C=(a-b, a+b)? Rotate vector AB = (a,b) by 90 deg to get AD = (-b,a), so D = (0,0) + (-b,a) = (-b,a)\\nThen C = B + (-b,a) = (a,b) + (-b,a) = (a-b, a+b)\\nOr C = D + (a,b) = (-b,a) + (a,b) = (a-b, a+b)\\nSame.\\nSo vertices: (0,0), (a,b), (a-b,a+b), (-b,a)\\nAll must be in P_n.\\nNow, their norms:\\n||A||^2 = 0\\n||B||^2 = a^2 + b^2\\n||D||^2 = (-b)^2 + a^2 = b^2 + a^2\\n||C||^2 = (a-b)^2 + (a+b)^2 = a^2 -2ab + b^2 + a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2a^2 + 2b^2\\nSo norms squared: 0, s, s, 2s where s=a^2+b^2\\nNow, in P_n, the nonzero norms are powers of 2, so s must be 2^k for some k≤n, and 2s = 2^{k+1} must also be ≤ 2^n, so k+1 ≤ n, i.e., k ≤ n-1\\nAlso, the points must be in ℤ², which they are if a,b integers.\\nMoreover, the points must be in P_n, meaning either (0,0) or on some circle x^2+y^2=2^m for m≤n.\\nHere, B and D have norm squared s=2^k, so they must be in S_k\\nC has norm squared 2s=2^{k+1}, so in S_{k+1}\\nAnd A=(0,0) is included.\\nNow, are these points actually in the sets?\\nFor example, take k=0: s=1, so a^2+b^2=1, so (a,b)=(±1,0) or (0,±1)\\nSay (a,b)=(1,0)\\nThen points:\\nA=(0,0)\\nB=(1,0)\\nD=(-b,a)=(0,1)\\nC=(a-b,a+b)=(1-0,0+1)=(1,1)\\nNorms: A:0, B:1, D:1, C:1+1=2\\nSo C should be on x^2+y^2=2, which is S_1\\nNow, are these in P_n? For n≥1, yes.\\nThe four points: (0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)\\nDo they form a square? Yes: unit square in first quadrant.\\nVertices: (0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1) — yes, exactly.\\nIn our calculation: A=(0,0), B=(1,0), C=(1,1), D=(0,1) — perfect.\\nNow, for this to be in P_n, we need S_0 and S_1, so k=0 and k+1=1 ≤ n, so n≥1\\nSimilarly, if (a,b)=(0,1), then B=(0,1), D=(-1,0), C=(-1,1), etc., another square.\\nBut (a,b) determines the direction.\\nNow, how many such squares for fixed k?\\nWe need s=2^k, and (a,b) such that a^2+b^2=2^k, and then the square is determined.\\nBut (a,b) must be one of the points in S_k, but S_k has specific points.\\nFor example, k=0: s=1, possible (a,b): (1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)\\nTake (a,b)=(1,0): gives square: (0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1)\\n(a,b)=(-1,0): B=(-1,0), D=(0,-1)? D=(-b,a)=(0,-1), C=(a-b,a+b)=(-1-0,0+(-1))? a=-1,b=0\\nC=(a-b,a+b)=(-1-0, -1+0)? Earlier formula C=(a-b,a+b)\\nWith a=-1,b=0: C=(-1-0, -1+0)=(-1,-1)? But should be: from A=(0,0), B=(-1,0), D=(0,-1)? Rotate AB=(-1,0) by 90 deg CCW: (0,-1), so D=(0,-1)\\nThen C=B + (0,-1)=(-1,-1)? Or D + AB = (0,-1) + (-1,0)=(-1,-1)\\nPoints: (0,0),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(0,-1) — yes, square in third quadrant.\\nSimilarly, (a,b)=(0,1): B=(0,1), D=(-1,0), C=(-1,1) — square in second quadrant.\\n(a,b)=(0,-1): B=(0,-1), D=(1,0), C=(1,-1) — fourth quadrant.\\nSo four such squares for k=0? But each uses different points.\\nBut are they distinct subsets? Yes.\\nNow, for k=1: s=2^1=2, so a^2+b^2=2, so (a,b)=(±1,±1)\\nSay (a,b)=(1,1)\\nThen B=(1,1)\\nD=(-b,a)=(-1,1)\\nC=(a-b,a+b)=(1-1,1+1)=(0,2)\\nNorms: B:1+1=2, D:1+1=2, C:0+4=4=2^2\\nSo C should be in S_2\\nPoints: (0,0),(1,1),(-1,1),(0,2)\\nDo they form a square? Let's see vectors:\\nFrom (0,0) to (1,1): (1,1)\\nFrom (0,0) to (-1,1): (-1,1)? But in our assignment, D is (-1,1), but is it adjacent?\\nVertices: A=(0,0), B=(1,1), C=(0,2), D=(-1,1)\\nPlot: (0,0), (1,1), (0,2), (-1,1)\\nNow, distance A to B: √(1+1)=√2\\nA to D: √(1+1)=√2\\nB to C: from (1,1) to (0,2): dx=-1, dy=1, dist √(1+1)=√2\\nC to D: (0,2) to (-1,1): dx=-1, dy=-1, dist √(1+1)=√2\\nD to A: (-1,1) to (0,0): dx=1,dy=-1, dist √2\\nNow angles: at A, vectors to B (1,1) and to D (-1,1), dot product (1)(-1)+(1)(1)= -1+1=0, so 90 deg.\\nSimilarly, at B: from A to B (1,1), from B to C (-1,1), dot product (1)(-1)+(1)(1)= -1+1=0, good.\\nSo yes, it's a square, rotated.\\nSide length √2, but larger.\\nPoints: (0,0),(1,1),(0,2),(-1,1)\\nNow, are these in P_n? For n≥2, since C=(0,2) has norm 4=2^2, so in S_2, and B,D in S_1, A in origin.\\nNow, how many such for k=1?\\n(a,b) can be any point in S_1, i.e., (±1,±1) — four choices.\\nEach gives a square.\\nFor (a,b)=(1,1): as above\\n(a,b)=(1,-1): B=(1,-1), D=(-(-1),1)=(1,1)? D=(-b,a)=(-(-1),1)=(1,1)\\nC=(a-b,a+b)=(1-(-1),1+(-1))=(2,0)\\nPoints: (0,0),(1,-1),(1,1),(2,0)\\nSimilarly, a square.\\nSimilarly for others.\\nSo four squares for k=1.\\nBut k=1, s=2, and we need k+1=2≤n, so n≥2\\nNow, in general, for each k such that 0≤k≤n-1, and for each point in S_k, we can form such a square?\\nBut each square is determined by the choice of (a,b), but different (a,b) might give same square?\\nIn k=0, we had four choices, gave four different squares.\\nIn k=1, four choices, four different squares.\\nBut is there overlap?\\nFor example, the square for (a,b)=(1,0) in k=0 is {(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1)}\\nFor k=1, (a,b)=(1,1): {(0,0),(1,1),(0,2),(-1,1)} — different.\\nNow, but notice that for a fixed k, each choice of (a,b) in S_k gives a square, but S_k has four points, and we are choosing one as B, but in the square, B is a specific vertex.\\nBut since the square has four vertices, and we are fixing A=(0,0), and B adjacent, so each square is counted once for each possible B adjacent to (0,0).\\nBut in this construction, for a given square containing (0,0), how many times is it counted?\\nFor example, the unit square {(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1)}\\nIt has two vertices adjacent to (0,0): (1,0) and (0,1)\\nIf we choose B=(1,0), we get this square\\nIf we choose B=(0,1), we get: a=0,b=1, then D=(-1,0), C=(-1,1), so square {(0,0),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0)} — different square!\\nOh! So when we choose different (a,b), we get different squares, even for same k.\\nIn fact, for k=0, we got four distinct squares: one in each quadrant.\\nSimilarly for k=1, four distinct squares.\\nNow, are these squares disjoint? In terms of points?\\nFor k=0: squares use points from S_0 and S_1? For k=0: s=1, points: (0,0), and points in S_0: (±1,0),(0,±1), and C=(a-b,a+b), for (a,b)=(1,0): C=(1,1), which is in S_1 since 1^2+1^2=2=2^1\\nSimilarly, for (a,b)=(0,1): C=(-1,1), in S_1\\nSo each such square uses (0,0), two points from S_0, and one point from S_1? No: in the square {(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1)}, the points are: (0,0), (1,0)∈S_0, (0,1)∈S_0, (1,1)∈S_1\\nS_0 has (±1,0),(0,±1), so yes, two from S_0, one from S_1, and origin.\\nBut S_0 has four points, but here we use only two: (1,0) and (0,1)\\nSimilarly, for the square from (a,b)=(-1,0): {(0,0),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(0,-1)} — uses (-1,0),(0,-1) from S_0, and (-1,-1) from S_1\\nSimilarly, others.\\nNow, for k=1: s=2, (a,b) in S_1, say (1,1), then C=(0,2), which is in S_2, since 0^2+2^2=4=2^2\\nPoints: (0,0),(1,1),(-1,1),(0,2)\\n(1,1) and (-1,1) are in S_1, (0,2) in S_2\\nS_1 has four points: (±1,±1), here we use (1,1) and (-1,1), which are two of them.\\nSimilarly for others.\\nSo each such square uses: (0,0), two points from S_k, and one point from S_{k+1}\\nSpecifically, for a given k, and choice of (a,b) in S_k, we get a square.\\nHow many choices? S_k has four points, so four choices per k.\\nBut for each k, we get four squares.\\nBut are they all distinct? Yes, because they use different sets of points.\\nFor example, k=0: four squares, each in a different quadrant, using different pairs from S_0.\\nSimilarly for k=1.\\nNow, but we also have the squares that are just the S_k themselves, without origin.\\nEarlier we said each S_k forms a square by itself.\\nFor example, S_0: {(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)} — this is a square (rotated).\\nSimilarly, S_1: {(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1)} — axis-aligned square.\\nNow, are these included in our previous count? No, because they don't include (0,0).\\nSo we have two types of squares:\\n\\nType 1: The entire set S_k for k=0 to n. Each such set is a 4-point subset forming a square. There are n+1 such sets (k=0 to n).\\n\\nType 2: Squares that include (0,0), constructed as above for each k from 0 to n-1, and for each of the four choices in S_k, giving a square. So for each k=0 to n-1, four squares.\\nNumber: 4n for k=0 to n-1? k from 0 to n-1 inclusive, that's n values, each with 4 squares, so 4n squares.\\n\\nBut is that all?\\n\\nAre there more squares?\\n\\nFor example, could there be squares not containing the origin and not equal to some S_k?\\n\\nSuppose a square formed by points from different S_k.\\nFor example, could there be a square using points from S_k and S_m for k≠m?\\n\\nNote that all points in P_n except origin are on circles of radius sqrt(2^k) for k=0 to n.\\n\\nSuppose we have a square not centered at origin.\\nFor example, a small square like {(1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(0,0)} but that includes origin, already counted.\\nWithout origin: say {(1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,1)} but are these in P_n? (1,1): norm 2, so in S_1 if 1≤n\\n(1,2): 1+4=5, not power of 2, so not in any S_k, unless 5=2^k, no. So not in P_n.\\nSimilarly, most lattice points are not in P_n, only those on the specified circles.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps squares that are larger, but still on these circles.\\n\\nNote that the sets S_k are symmetric under rotation by 90 degrees and reflections, since they are orbits.\\n\\nSuppose a square with vertices on different circles.\\nAssume the square is centered at origin. Then vertices would be at (a,b), (-b,a), (-a,-b), (b,-a) or something, but rotated.\\nStandard: if centered at origin, vertices at v, iv, -v, -iv in complex numbers.\\nSo let z = x+iy, then points z, iz, -z, -iz.\\nThen |z|^2 = x^2+y^2, |iz|^2 = |-y + i x| = y^2 + x^2, same, so all four points have same norm squared.\\nTherefore, if a square is centered at origin, all vertices must have the same distance from origin, so they must all lie on the same circle x^2+y^2 = r^2.\\nIn our case, r^2 = 2^k for some k, so all on S_k.\\nBut S_k has exactly four points, and for each k, those four points form a square, as we already have.\\nMoreover, are there other squares on S_k? For example, could we form a different square with the same four points? But four points determine at most one square, but in this case, for S_k, the four points are in convex position and form a square, so the only 4-point subset is itself, which we already count.\\nSo no other squares centered at origin.\\n\\nNow, squares not centered at origin.\\nSuppose a square not containing origin and not centered at origin.\\nFor example, suppose a square with vertices at (a,b), (c,d), etc.\\nBut given the sparsity, likely not.\\nFor instance, take n large, but the points are only on the axes and diagonals.\\nSpecifically, all points in P_n are of the form:\\n- (0,0)\\n- For even k=2m: (±2^m, 0), (0, ±2^m)\\n- For odd k=2m+1: (±2^m, ±2^m)\\nSo the nonzero points are on the lines x=0, y=0, x=y, x=-y.\\nThat is, the two axes and the two diagonals.\\nNow, can we form a square with vertices on these lines?\\nFor example, suppose a square with sides not parallel to axes or diagonals.\\nBut the points are constrained to these four lines.\\nNow, a square has four vertices, each on one of these lines.\\nBut due to symmetry, perhaps possible, but let's try small n.\\nTake n=1.\\nP_1 = {(0,0)} ∪ S_0 ∪ S_1\\nS_0: (±1,0),(0,±1)\\nS_1: (±1,±1)\\nSo points: origin, and all (±1,0),(0,±1),(±1,±1) — total 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 points.\\nNow, list all 4-point subsets that form squares.\\nFirst, Type 1: S_k for k=0,1\\nS_0: {(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)} — forms a square (diamond)\\nS_1: {(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1)} — forms a square (axis-aligned)\\nSecond, Type 2: squares containing (0,0), for k=0 (since k≤n-1=0)\\nFor k=0, s=1, four choices:\\nAs before: \\n- (a,b)=(1,0): square {(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1)}\\n- (a,b)=(-1,0): {(0,0),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(0,-1)}\\n- (a,b)=(0,1): {(0,0),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0)}\\n- (a,b)=(0,-1): {(0,0),(0,-1),(1,-1),(1,0)}\\nNote: (1,0) is used in first and last.\\nBut the squares are different.\\nNow, are there more?\\nFor example, is there a square like {(1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(0,0)} but that's already included (first one above).\\nOr without origin: say {(1,1),(1,0),(0,1),(0,0)} same.\\nOr perhaps {(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1)} already have.\\nOr smaller squares: but no other points.\\nWhat about {(1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1)} — that's S_0, already have.\\nOr mixed: say {(1,1),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)} no.\\nSuppose a square with vertices (1,1),(1,-1),( -1,1),(-1,-1) — already have.\\nOr perhaps a square like (1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1) — same as S_0.\\nNow, is there a square not including origin and not S_k? For example, {(1,1),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)} no.\\nOr {(1,1),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)} same.\\nAll seem covered.\\nBut in the Type 2, we have four squares, each is a small unit square in each quadrant.\\nNow, total squares: Type 1: two (S_0 and S_1)\\nType 2: four (the corner squares)\\nTotal six.\\nBut is that all?\\nNote that in Type 2, for example, the square {(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1)} uses points from S_0 and S_1.\\nSimilarly.\\nNow, are there squares that use only points from higher k? But for n=1, only up to k=1.\\nNow, another possibility: could there be a square using two points from S_0 and two from S_1, but not including origin?\\nFor example, take (1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(0,0) — includes origin.\\nOr (1,0),(0,1),(1,1), and say (-1,-1)? But (-1,-1) is in S_1.\\nPoints: (1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(-1,-1)\\nDo they form a square? Distances: (1,0) to (0,1): √2\\n(1,0) to (1,1): 1\\nAlready different, so no.\\nOr (1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,0)? (1,0) to (1,1):1, to (0,1):√2, not equal.\\nUnlikely.\\nPerhaps no others.\\nNow for n=2.\\nP_2 adds S_2: x^2+y^2=4, so (±2,0),(0,±2)\\nSo points: previous plus (±2,0),(0,±2)\\nNow, Type 1: S_k for k=0,1,2: three squares\\nType 2: for k=0 and k=1 (since k≤n-1=1)\\nFor k=0: four squares as before\\nFor k=1: s=2, (a,b) in S_1, i.e., (±1,±1)\\nTake (a,b)=(1,1): then B=(1,1), D=(-1,1), C=(a-b,a+b)=(1-1,1+1)=(0,2)\\nPoints: (0,0),(1,1),(-1,1),(0,2)\\nSimilarly, (a,b)=(1,-1): B=(1,-1), D=(1,1)? D=(-b,a)=(-(-1),1)=(1,1), C=(1-(-1),1+(-1))=(2,0)\\nPoints: (0,0),(1,-1),(1,1),(2,0)\\nSimilarly, (a,b)=(-1,1): B=(-1,1), D=(-1,-1), C=(-1-1,-1+1)=(-2,0)? a=-1,b=1, C=(a-b,a+b)=(-1-1,-1+1)=(-2,0)\\nPoints: (0,0),(-1,1),(-1,-1),(-2,0)\\n(a,b)=(-1,-1): B=(-1,-1), D=(1,-1), C=(-1-(-1),-1+(-1))=(0,-2)\\nPoints: (0,0),(-1,-1),(1,-1),(0,-2)\\nSo four more squares for k=1.\\nTotal Type 2: for k=0:4, k=1:4, total 8\\nType 1: k=0,1,2: 3\\nTotal 11 squares.\\nNow, are there more?\\nFor example, could there be a square like the one for k=1 but without origin? Or other.\\nNote that S_2 itself is a square: {(2,0),(-2,0),(0,2),(0,-2)} — diamond shape.\\nAlso, perhaps squares not containing origin.\\nFor example, consider points (2,0),(0,2),(-2,0),(0,-2) — that's S_2, already counted.\\nOr mixed: say (1,1),(2,0),(1,-1),(0,0)? But includes origin.\\nWithout origin: say (1,1),(2,0),(1,-1), and ?\\nDistance (1,1) to (2,0): √[(1)^2 + (1)^2]=√2\\n(2,0) to (1,-1): √[(1)^2 + (1)^2]=√2\\n(1,-1) to ? Suppose next point, but need to close.\\nVector from (1,1) to (2,0): (1,-1)\\nRotate 90 deg: (1,1)? Rotate (1,-1) by 90 deg CCW: (1,1)? Rotation matrix: (x,y) -> (-y,x), so (1,-1) -> (1,1)\\nSo next point: (2,0) + (1,1) = (3,1)\\nBut (3,1): 9+1=10, not power of 2, not in P_n.\\nSimilarly, not.\\nPerhaps a square using (2,0),(0,2), etc., but with origin? Already have in Type 2.\\nAnother idea: perhaps a square like {(2,0),(0,2),(-2,0),(0,-2)} but that's S_2.\\nOr smaller ones.\\nNote that we might have squares that are translations, but unlikely due to symmetry.\\nPerhaps the only squares are the ones we have.\\nBut in Type 2, for each k, we have four squares, but notice that for larger k, similar.\\nNow, back to counting.\\nSo far:\\n- Type 1: one square for each k=0 to n: total n+1\\n- Type 2: for each k=0 to n-1, four squares: total 4n\\nBut for n=1: Type 1: 2, Type 2: 4*1=4? But k=0 only, since n-1=0, so k=0, four squares, total 2+4=6\\nEarlier I said for n=1: S_0, S_1, and four small squares, total 6, yes.\\nFor n=0: P_0 = {(0,0)} ∪ S_0 = {(0,0),(±1,0),(0,±1)}\\nType 1: k=0: S_0 = {(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)} — one square\\nType 2: k from 0 to -1? None, since n-1=-1<0\\nSo only one square.\\nIs that correct? Are there others?\\nSquares: S_0 is one.\\nDoes {(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(-1,0)} form a square? Points: (0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(-1,0)\\nThis is not a square; it's like a kite, but distances: (0,0) to (1,0):1, to (0,1):1, to (-1,0):1, but (1,0) to (0,1):√2, etc., not a square.\\nThe only 4-point subsets: total points: 5 points, choose 4: several, but only S_0 forms a square.\\nFor example, {(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(-1,0)} — not a square.\\n{(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)} — similarly.\\nSo yes, only one square for n=0.\\nNow for n=2: Type 1: k=0,1,2: 3\\nType 2: k=0 and k=1: 4 each, total 8\\nSum 11\\nNow, is there any other square?\\nFor example, could there be a square using S_2 and other points?\\nNote that in Type 2 for k=1, we have squares like {(0,0),(1,1),(0,2),(-1,1)}\\nThis uses (0,2) from S_2.\\nBut is there a square not using origin?\\nFor example, consider the points (2,0),(1,1),(0,2),(-1,1)? Do they form a square?\\nPoints: (2,0),(1,1),(0,2),(-1,1)\\nDistances: (2,0) to (1,1): √[(1)^2+(1)^2]=√2\\n(1,1) to (0,2): √[1+1]=√2\\n(0,2) to (-1,1): √[1+1]=√2\\n(-1,1) to (2,0): √[(3)^2+(1)^2]=√10 ≠ √2\\nNot equal.\\nOr check vectors.\\nFrom (2,0) to (1,1): (-1,1)\\nFrom (1,1) to (0,2): (-1,1)\\nSame vector? Then collinear, not a square.\\n(2,0) to (1,1): (-1,1)\\n(1,1) to (0,2): (-1,1) — same, so straight line.\\nNot good.\\nPerhaps (2,0),(0,2),(-2,0),(0,-2) — already S_2.\\nOr perhaps a rectangle, but not square.\\nAnother idea: could there be a square like the unit square but shifted? But no points.\\nPerhaps squares formed by points from same k, but we already have S_k.\\nOr perhaps for k even and odd, but seems not.\\nMaybe we missed some squares that include origin but are different.\\nFor example, in n=2, is there a square with (0,0),(2,0),(0,2),(2,2)? But (2,2): 4+4=8=2^3, so if n≥3, but for n=2, k≤2, 2^3=8>4, not included.\\nFor n=2, (2,2) not in P_2.\\nSimilarly.\\nSo probably no others.\\nBut in Type 2, for each k, we have four squares, but notice that when we go to higher n, we might have more.\\nBut in our count, for Type 2, we have 4n squares? For n=1, 4*1=4, yes; n=2, 4*2=8? But earlier I said for k=0 and k=1, each 4, so 8, yes.\\nBut k from 0 to n-1, number of k is n, each with 4 squares, so 4n.\\nType 1: n+1\\nTotal: (n+1) + 4n = 5n + 1\\nFor n=0: 5*0 +1=1, correct\\nn=1: 5+1=6, correct\\nn=2: 10+1=11, seems correct.\\nBut is this all?\\nEarlier for k=1 in Type 2, we have squares like {(0,0),(1,1),(0,2),(-1,1)}\\nBut (0,2) is in S_2, which requires n≥2.\\nIn general, for Type 2 with parameter k, we need k≤n-1, so that k+1≤n, so S_{k+1} ⊂ P_n.\\nAnd we have four such squares per k.\\nNow, but is there a square that uses, say, for k=2, but k=2 requires n≥3 for S_3, but in Type 2, k only up to n-1.\\nBut also, perhaps there are squares not involving origin and not S_k.\\nAnother thought: what about the square formed by S_k for each k, but we have that.\\nOr perhaps squares that are not aligned.\\nBut let me check for n=3.\\nP_3 adds S_3: x^2+y^2=8, so (±2,±2) — four points: (2,2),(2,-2),(-2,2),(-2,-2)\\nType 1: S_k for k=0,1,2,3: 4 squares\\nType 2: k=0,1,2 (since n-1=2)\\nFor k=0:4 squares\\nk=1:4 squares\\nk=2: s=4 (since k=2 even, s=2^k=4), so a^2+b^2=4, points in S_2: (±2,0),(0,±2)\\nTake (a,b)=(2,0)\\nThen B=(2,0)\\nD=(-b,a)=(0,2)\\nC=(a-b,a+b)=(2-0,2+0)=(2,2)? a=2,b=0\\nC=(a-b,a+b)=(2-0,2+0)=(2,2)\\nPoints: (0,0),(2,0),(0,2),(2,2)\\nNow, (2,2): 4+4=8=2^3, so in S_3, which is included since n=3.\\nSimilarly, other choices.\\n(a,b)=(2,0): gives {(0,0),(2,0),(0,2),(2,2)}\\n(a,b)=(-2,0): B=(-2,0), D=(0,-2), C=(-2-0,-2+0)=(-2,-2)? C=(a-b,a+b)=(-2-0,-2+0)=(-2,-2)\\nPoints: (0,0),(-2,0),(0,-2),(-2,-2)\\n(a,b)=(0,2): B=(0,2), D=(-2,0), C=(0-2,0+2)=(-2,2)\\nPoints: (0,0),(0,2),(-2,0),(-2,2)\\n(a,b)=(0,-2): B=(0,-2), D=(2,0), C=(0-(-2),0+(-2))=(2,-2)\\nPoints: (0,0),(0,-2),(2,0),(2,-2)\\nSo four squares for k=2.\\nTotal Type 2: k=0:4, k=1:4, k=2:4, total 12\\nType 1:4\\nTotal 16\\nAccording to formula 5n+1=5*3+1=16, yes.\\nNow, are there more? For example, is {(2,0),(0,2),(2,2),(0,0)} already included.\\nOr without origin: say {(2,2),(2,-2),(-2,2),(-2,-2)} — that's S_3, already in Type 1.\\nOr mixed: say (2,0),(2,2),(0,2),(0,0) — same as above.\\nSeems all covered.\\nBut notice that in this square {(0,0),(2,0),(0,2),(2,2)}, it is actually a square, axis-aligned? From (0,0) to (2,0) to (2,2) to (0,2)? But in our list, we have (0,0),(2,0),(0,2),(2,2), but the order might not be consecutive, but as a set, it's fine.\\nIn this set, the points are not in cyclic order, but the subset is the same regardless.\\nNow, is this subset already counted elsewhere? In Type 1? S_2 is {(2,0),(-2,0),(0,2),(0,-2)}, different.\\nS_3 is {(2,2),(2,-2),(-2,2),(-2,-2)}, different.\\nSo new.\\nAnd we have it in Type 2 for k=2.\\nNow, total seems consistent.\\nBut is there a square that we count multiple times? For example, does any square appear in both Type 1 and Type 2? No, because Type 1 doesn't have origin, Type 2 does.\\nWithin Type 2, different k give different squares, since they involve different S_k and S_{k+1}.\\nFor example, k=0 squares use S_0 and S_1, k=1 use S_1 and S_2, k=2 use S_2 and S_3, so different points.\\nSimilarly, Type 1 are pure S_k.\\nSo all disjoint.\\nTherefore, total number is (n+1) + 4n = 5n + 1\\nBut for n=0:1, n=1:6, n=2:11, n=3:16, all match.\\nBut is this correct?\\nIn Type 2, for each k from 0 to n-1, we have four squares.\\nBut in the construction, for a given k, and each (a,b) in S_k, we get a square.\\nS_k has four points, and each gives a distinct square, as seen.\\nAnd for different k, different.\\nType 1: n+1 squares.\\nSo total 5n+1.\\nBut the problem asks for the number of four-point subsets, and we have counted them.\\nBut let me confirm with n=1: we have 6 squares.\\nList:\\n1.

Probably not a square.\\nI think we have all.\\nAnother way to think: the only squares are the concentric ones at origin (S_k) and the \"corner\" squares attached to origin in each direction for each scale.\\nSo total number is 5n + 1.\\nBut for n=0, 1; n=1,6; etc.\\nNow, back to Problem 1, we have m=4.\\nSo answers:\\nProblem 1: 4\\nProblem 2: 5n + 1\\nBut the answer should be in exact form.\\nFor Problem 2, as a function of n, so 5n+1.\\nNow, in the JSON.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"5n+1\"\n}",
