We will plug in small values of $ m $ and $ n $ to extract information.\\n\\nStep 1: Let $ m = n = 1 $.\\nThen:\\n$$\\nf(1) + f(1) - 1\\\\cdot1 = 2a - 1 \\\\neq 0,\\n$$\\nand it must divide\\n$$\\n1\\\\cdot f(1) + 1\\\\cdot f(1) = 2a.\\n$$\\nSo $ 2a - 1 \\\\mid 2a $.\\n\\nBut $ 2a - 1 \\\\mid 2a $ implies $ 2a - 1 \\\\mid 2a - (2a - 1) = 1 $.\\nThus, $ 2a - 1 \\\\mid 1 $, so $ 2a - 1 = 1 $ (since it's positive), hence $ a = 1 $.\\n\\nTherefore, $ f(1) = 1 $, so $ \\\\kappa = f(1) - 1 = 0 $.\\n\\nNow verify consistency: is this possible?\\n\\nSuppose $ f(1) = 1 $. Let us try $ m = 1 $, arbitrary $ n $.\\nThen:\\n$$\\nf(1) + f(n) - 1\\\\cdot n = 1 + f(n) - n \\\\neq 0,\\n$$\\ndivides\\n$$\\n1\\\\cdot f(1) + n f(n) = 1 + n f(n).\\n$$\\nSo $ 1 + f(n) - n \\\\mid 1 + n f(n) $.\\n\\nLet $ d_n = f(n) - n + 1 $. Then $ d_n \\\\neq 0 $, and $ d_n \\\\mid 1 + n f(n) $.\\nBut $ f(n) = d_n + n - 1 $, so substitute:\\n$$\\n1 + n f(n) = 1 + n(d_n + n - 1) = 1 + n d_n + n^2 - n = n d_n + (n^2 - n + 1).\\n$$\\nSo $ d_n \\\\mid n d_n + (n^2 - n + 1) $, which implies $ d_n \\\\mid n^2 - n + 1 $.\\nThus, $ d_n $ divides $ n^2 - n + 1 $, and since $ f(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} $, $ f(n) \\\\geq 1 $, so $ d_n = f(n) - n + 1 \\\\geq 2 - n $. But $ d_n \\\\mid n^2 - n + 1 $, so $ d_n $ is bounded in absolute value by $ n^2 - n + 1 $, but we only care about positive divisors since $ f(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} $.\\n\\nBut more importantly, from earlier we already deduced $ f(1) = 1 $ is forced by the divisibility condition at $ m=n=1 $, and no other possibility exists. So $ \\\\kappa = 0 $.\\n\\nThus, answer to Problem 1 is $ \\\\kappa = 0 $.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe are to determine whether there exists a sequence $ F(1), F(2), \\\\ldots $ of non-negative integers satisfying:\\n\\n(a) Every non-negative integer appears in the sequence.\\n(b) Each positive integer appears infinitely often.\\n(c) For all $ n \\\\geq 2 $,\\n$$\\nF(F(n^{163})) = F(F(n)) + F(F(361)).\\n$$\\n\\nLet’s analyze (c). Define $ c = F(F(361)) $, a fixed non-negative integer.\\nThen for all $ n \\\\geq 2 $,\\n$$\\nF(F(n^{163})) = F(F(n)) + c.\\n$$\\n\\nThis is a functional equation on the composition $ F \\\\circ F $.\\n\\nLet $ G(n) = F(F(n)) $. Then for $ n \\\\geq 2 $,\\n$$\\nG(n^{163}) = G(n) + c.\\n$$\\n\\nNow consider iterating this.\\n\\nFix $ n \\\\geq 2 $. Define a sequence:\\n$$\\nn_0 = n,\\\\quad n_1 = n^{163},\\\\quad n_2 = (n^{163})^{163} = n^{163^2},\\\\quad \\\\ldots,\\\\quad n_k = n^{163^k}.\\n$$\\nThen\\n$$\\nG(n_k) = G(n_{k-1}) + c = G(n_{k-2}) + 2c = \\\\cdots = G(n) + k c.\\n$$\\nSo $ G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c $.\\n\\nNow, $ G(m) = F(F(m)) $ is a non-negative integer for all $ m $, so $ G(m) \\\\geq 0 $.\\n\\nIf $ c > 0 $, then as $ k \\\\to \\\\infty $, $ G(n^{163^k}) \\\\to \\\\infty $. That’s fine — it can grow.\\nBut now recall condition (a): every non-negative integer appears in the sequence $ F(1), F(2), \\\\ldots $.\\nAnd (b): each positive integer appears infinitely often.\\n\\nBut look at $ G(n) = F(F(n)) $. Since $ F(n) $ takes on all non-negative integers (by (a)), and $ F $ is defined on all indices, $ F(F(n)) $ means we evaluate $ F $ at values that include every non-negative integer (as $ F(n) $ hits them all).\\n\\nBut $ G(n) = F(F(n)) $, so the range of $ G $ is contained in the range of $ F $, which is fine.\\n\\nBut now suppose $ c > 0 $. Then $ G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c \\\\to \\\\infty $ as $ k \\\\to \\\\infty $, so $ G(n) $ is unbounded. That’s acceptable.\\n\\nBut now consider how fast $ n^{163^k} $ grows — extremely fast. But still, for each $ k $, $ G $ at that point increases linearly with $ k $.\\n\\nHowever, here’s a problem: $ G(m) = F(F(m)) $, and $ F(m) $ is a non-negative integer. So $ G(m) $ is determined by applying $ F $ twice.\\n\\nNow, suppose $ c = 0 $. Then $ G(n^{163}) = G(n) $ for all $ n \\\\geq 2 $.\\nThen $ G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) $ for all $ k $.\\nBut $ n^{163^k} \\\\to \\\\infty $, so $ G $ takes the same value infinitely often along this sequence.\\nThat’s okay.\\n\\nBut if $ c = 0 $, then $ G(n^{163}) = G(n) $, so $ G $ is constant on the orbit $ n, n^{163}, n^{163^2}, \\\\ldots $\\n\\nBut now, could $ c \\\\neq 0 $? Suppose $ c \\\\geq 1 $. Then $ G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c \\\\to \\\\infty $, so $ G(m) \\\\to \\\\infty $ along this subsequence.\\n\\nBut now, here's a contradiction idea: the left-hand side $ G(n^{163^k}) = F(F(n^{163^k})) $ must be some non-negative integer, growing without bound. But $ F $ maps to non-negative integers, and by (a), every non-negative integer appears, but by (b), each positive integer appears infinitely often — so $ F $ cannot tend to infinity; in fact, it must return to every positive integer infinitely often.\\n\\nBut $ G(m) = F(F(m)) $. Since $ F(m) $ takes on every non-negative integer (including 0), and each positive integer infinitely often, then $ F(F(m)) $ depends on the values of $ F $ at arguments that are hit infinitely often.\\n\\nBut suppose that $ F(k) $ is bounded. Then $ G(m) = F(F(m)) $ would also be bounded, since $ F(m) $ ranges over a finite set of values, and $ F $ applied to those gives bounded output. But if $ c > 0 $, $ G(n^{163^k}) \\\\to \\\\infty $, so $ G $ is unbounded, so $ F \\\\circ F $ is unbounded, so $ F $ must be unbounded.\\n\\nBut even if $ F $ is unbounded, we have a bigger issue: periodicity or recurrence.\\n\\nTry to assume such a sequence exists and reach contradiction.\\n\\nSuppose $ c = F(F(361)) \\\\geq 1 $. Then $ G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c \\\\to \\\\infty $.\\nSo $ G(m) $ is unbounded.\\n\\nBut now, since $ G(m) = F(F(m)) $, and $ F(m) $ takes values in $ \\\\mathbb{Z}_{\\\\geq 0} $, let’s consider the preimage.\\n\\nBecause $ F $ satisfies (b): each positive integer appears infinitely often, so for any $ x \\\\geq 1 $, the set $ \\\\{ m : F(m) = x \\\\} $ is infinite.\\n\\nNow, $ G(m) = F(F(m)) $. So $ G(m) = y $ means $ F(F(m)) = y $, so $ F(k) = y $ where $ k = F(m) $.\\n\\nSo the value $ G(m) $ depends on $ F $ evaluated at the values that $ F(m) $ takes.\\n\\nBut since $ F(m) $ takes every non-negative integer, including 0, and each positive integer infinitely often, then the values $ F(k) $ for $ k $ in the image of $ F $ determine $ G $.\\n\\nBut now, fix $ n \\\\geq 2 $. Then $ G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c $. As $ k \\\\to \\\\infty $, this goes to infinity.\\n\\nBut $ n^{163^k} $ grows very fast, so these are sparse points.\\n\\nNow, can $ G(m) $ go to infinity along a sequence? Yes, but we need to see if it conflicts with (a) and (b).\\n\\nBut here’s a better idea: suppose we set $ n = 361 $. Note that 361 = 19².\\n\\nLet $ n = 361 $. Then for $ n \\\\geq 2 $, we have:\\n$$\\nG(361^{163}) = G(361) + c.\\n$$\\nBut $ c = F(F(361)) = G(361) $.\\nSo:\\n$$\\nG(361^{163}) = G(361) + G(361) = 2 G(361).\\n$$\\nSimilarly,\\n$$\\nG((361^{163})^{163}) = G(361^{163^2}) = G(361^{163}) + c = 2G(361) + G(361) = 3G(361),\\n$$\\nand so on:\\n$$\\nG(361^{163^k}) = (k+1) G(361).\\n$$\\nSo $ G(361^{163^k}) = (k+1) c $, since $ c = G(361) $.\\n\\nSo $ G $ takes arbitrarily large values — so $ G(m) \\\\to \\\\infty $ along this subsequence.\\n\\nBut now, $ G(m) = F(F(m)) $, so $ F(F(m)) $ becomes arbitrarily large.\\n\\nBut now, recall condition (a): every non-negative integer appears in the sequence $ F(1), F(2), \\\\ldots $. So 0 appears at least once.\\n\\nAlso, (b): each positive integer appears infinitely often.\\n\\nNow, suppose $ c = 0 $. Then $ G(n^{163}) = G(n) $ for all $ n \\\\geq 2 $.\\nIn particular, $ G(361^{163^k}) = G(361) = c = 0 $ for all $ k $.\\nSo $ F(F(361^{163^k})) = 0 $.\\n\\nSo $ F(F(m)) = 0 $ for $ m = 361^{163^k} $, infinitely many $ m $.\\nSo there are infinitely many $ m $ such that $ F(F(m)) = 0 $.\\n\\nNow, $ F(F(m)) = 0 $ means $ F(k) = 0 $ where $ k = F(m) $.\\nSo for such $ m $, $ F(m) $ must be in the set $ S = \\\\{ t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} : F(t) = 0 \\\\} $.\\n\\nNow, $ F(t) = 0 $ for some $ t $, because 0 appears in the sequence (by (a)).\\nLet $ T = \\\\{ t : F(t) = 0 \\\\} $. This set is non-empty.\\n\\nThen $ F(F(m)) = 0 $ iff $ F(m) \\\\in T $.\\n\\nSo for infinitely many $ m $, $ F(m) \\\\in T $.\\n\\nBut $ T $ is some fixed set. If $ T $ is finite, then $ F(m) $ takes values in a finite set infinitely often — that’s fine.\\nBut (b) says each positive integer appears infinitely often, but doesn’t restrict how often 0 appears.\\n\\nBut now, if $ c = 0 $, then $ G(n^{163}) = G(n) $ for all $ n \\\\geq 2 $.\\nSo $ G $ is invariant under $ n \\\\mapsto n^{163} $.\\n\\nNow, start from any $ n \\\\geq 2 $, and define $ n_k = n^{163^k} $, then $ G(n_k) = G(n) $ for all $ k $.\\n\\nNow, these $ n_k $ are distinct and go to infinity.\\nSo $ G $ is constant on the infinite set $ \\\\{ n^{163^k} : k \\\\geq 0 \\\\} $.\\n\\nBut this must hold for every $ n \\\\geq 2 $.\\n\\nNow, could two such sequences intersect? Probably not, due to unique factorization.\\nFor example, $ n^{163^k} = m^{163^l} $ implies $ n $ and $ m $ are powers, but generically they are disjoint.\\nSo $ G $ takes the value $ G(n) $ infinitely often for each $ n $, but that’s okay.\\n\\nBut now, can $ G $ take all values? Not necessarily.\\n\\nBut we need $ F $ to satisfy (a) and (b).\\n\\nBut here’s a problem: suppose $ c = 0 $. Then $ G(n^{163}) = G(n) $.\\nBut also, from the equation, $ F(F(n^{163})) = F(F(n)) $.\\n\\nNow, suppose we want $ F $ to take all values.\\nBut no immediate contradiction.\\n\\nBut now, suppose $ c > 0 $. Then $ G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c \\\\to \\\\infty $.\\nSo $ G(m) \\\\to \\\\infty $ as $ m \\\\to \\\\infty $ along certain sequences.\\n\\nBut now, since $ G(m) = F(F(m)) $, and $ F(m) $ takes every positive integer infinitely often, let’s consider how often $ G(m) $ can grow.\\n\\nBut here’s a key point: the argument $ m = n^{163^k} $ grows very fast, so between $ n^{163^k} $ and $ n^{163^{k+1}} $, there are huge gaps.\\n\\nBut $ G(m) $ could fluctuate.\\n\\nHowever, consider that $ F(F(m)) $ must be defined for all $ m $, and if $ c > 0 $, then for each fixed $ n $, $ G $ grows linearly with $ k $ along the exponential tower.\\n\\nBut now, the range of $ G $ includes arbitrarily large integers, so $ F \\\\circ F $ is unbounded, so $ F $ must be unbounded.\\n\\nBut (b) requires that each positive integer appears infinitely often, so $ F $ cannot go to infinity; in fact, it must return to every value infinitely often.\\n\\nBut $ G(m) = F(F(m)) $: even if $ F(m) $ returns to small values, $ F(F(m)) $ could still grow if when $ F(m) $ is large, $ F $ of that is large.\\n\\nBut we need to see if the functional equation can be satisfied while meeting (a) and (b).\\n\\nTry to construct such a sequence.\\n\\nSuppose we try $ F(n) = 0 $ for all $ n $. Then (a) fails — only 0 appears.\\n\\nSuppose $ F(n) = n $. Then $ F(F(n)) = n $, so $ G(n) = n $. Then $ G(n^{163}) = n^{163} $, $ G(n) + c = n + c $. Not equal unless $ n^{163} = n + c $, impossible for all $ n $.\\n\\nSuppose $ F(n) = c $ constant. Then $ F(F(n)) = F(c) = c $. So $ G(n) = c $. Then equation: $ c = c + c \\\\Rightarrow c = 0 $. So $ F(n) = 0 $ for all $ n $. Then $ G(n) = 0 $. Equation: $ 0 = 0 + 0 $, true. But (a) fails — only 0 appears. (b) fails — positive integers don't appear at all.\\n\\nSuppose $ F(n) = v_2(n) $, the 2-adic valuation, but not defined for all n, and not non-negative integer in range meaningfully.\\n\\nAnother idea: suppose $ F(n) = k $ for all $ n $ in some class.\\n\\nBut hard.\\n\\nBack to the equation: $ G(n^{163}) = G(n) + c $ with $ c = G(361) $.\\n\\nSuppose $ c = 0 $. Then $ G(n^{163}) = G(n) $ for all $ n \\\\geq 2 $.\\n\\nNow, let’s consider $ n = 2 $. Then $ G(2^{163}) = G(2) $, $ G(2^{163^2}) = G(2) $, etc.\\n\\nNow, is there a conflict with (a) and (b)?\\n\\nSuppose we define $ F $ such that $ F(n) = 0 $ if $ n $ is a perfect 163-power, else $ F(n) = something $.\\nBut complicated.\\n\\nBut here’s a critical observation: the number 163 is prime? 163 is a prime number. 361 = 19^2.\\nNot sure if relevant.\\n\\nBut consider that the map $ n \\\\mapsto n^{163} $ is injective on $ \\\\mathbb{N}_{\\\\geq 2} $.\\n\\nNow, suppose $ c \\\\neq 0 $. Then $ G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c $.\\nAs $ k \\\\to \\\\infty $, this tends to infinity.\\nBut $ G(m) = F(F(m)) $, and $ F(m) $ takes each positive integer infinitely often.\\nIn particular, there are infinitely many $ m $ such that $ F(m) = 1 $, say.\\nThen $ G(m) = F(1) $, a fixed number.\\nSimilarly, for any fixed $ k $, if $ F(m) = k $, then $ G(m) = F(k) $.\\nSo $ G(m) $ can only take values in the set $ \\\\{ F(k) : k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_{\\\\geq 0} \\\\} $, which is the range of $ F $.\\nBut by (a), the range of $ F $ includes all non-negative integers.\\nSo $ G(m) $ can take any non-negative integer value — in principle.\\nBut the issue is the growth.\\n\\nBut no contradiction yet.\\n\\nHowever, note that for each fixed $ k $, the value $ G(m) = F(k) $ whenever $ F(m) = k $.\\nSince $ F(m) = k $ for infinitely many $ m $, $ G(m) = F(k) $ for infinitely many $ m $.\\nSo each value in the range of $ F $ appears as $ G(m) $ infinitely often — because each $ k $ is hit infinitely often by $ F $, and $ G(m) = F(F(m)) = F(k) $ when $ F(m) = k $, so the value $ F(k) $ appears infinitely often in $ G $.\\n\\nBut if $ c > 0 $, then along the sequence $ m_k = n^{163^k} $, $ G(m_k) = G(n) + k c \\\\to \\\\infty $, and these are distinct values for large $ k $ if $ c > 0 $, since it increases.\\nBut each individual value $ v $ can only appear finitely many times in this sequence, but that’s fine — the point is that $ G(m_k) $ takes arbitrarily large values, which is allowed since range is all non-negative integers.\\n\\nBut now, the problem is that $ G(m_k) $ increases without bound, but for $ G(m) $ to take a particular value $ v $, it must be that $ F(F(m)) = v $, which happens when $ F(m) $ is in the preimage of $ v $ under $ F $.\\n\\nBut since $ F $ hits each positive integer infinitely often, and 0 at least once, the preimage of any $ v $ under $ F $ is infinite (if $ v $ is in the range), which it is.\\n\\nBut no contradiction.\\n\\nWait — but if $ c > 0 $, then $ G(m_k) $ is strictly increasing for large $ k $, so all values $ G(m_k) $ are distinct for sufficiently large $ k $.\\nBut each value in the range of $ G $ must be achieved infinitely often? No! The conditions do not require that $ G(m) $ takes each value infinitely often. Only that $ F(m) $ does.\\n$ G(m) = F(F(m)) $ could take some values only finitely often.\\n\\nFor example, if $ F(k) $ grows, then $ G(m) $ could grow when $ F(m) $ is large.\\n\\nBut in our case, for a fixed $ n $, $ G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c $, so if $ c > 0 $, this is an arithmetic sequence, so all values are distinct, so $ G $ takes infinitely many distinct values, which is fine.\\n\\nBut now, is there any restriction that prevents this?\\n\\nRecall that $ c = G(361) = F(F(361)) $.\\nSuppose $ c > 0 $. Then $ G(361^{163^k}) = (k+1)c $, as before.\\nSo $ G $ takes values $ c, 2c, 3c, \\\\ldots $\\nSo all multiples of $ c $ are in the range of $ G $, hence in the range of $ F $.\\nBut (a) requires all non-negative integers to be in the range of $ F $, so if $ c > 1 $, then numbers not divisible by $ c $ may not be hit by $ G $, but $ G $ doesn't need to hit them — $ F $ does.\\n$ G $ is $ F \\\\circ F $, its range is a subset of the range of $ F $, but not necessarily equal.\\nSo as long as $ F $ hits all integers, it's ok if $ G $ only hits multiples of $ c $.\\n\\nBut $ F $ must hit all non-negative integers, including those not divisible by $ c $.\\nBut $ G $ doesn't have to.\\n\\nSo no problem.\\n\\nBut can we construct such a function?\\n\\nTry to set $ c = 0 $. Then $ G(n^{163}) = G(n) $ for all $ n \\\\geq 2 $.\\nSuppose we set $ G(n) = 0 $ for all $ n \\\\geq 2 $. And choose $ F $ such that $ F(F(n)) = 0 $ for $ n \\\\geq 2 $.\\nAlso, need to handle $ n=1 $, but the equation is for $ n \\\\geq 2 $, so $ F(1) $ can be chosen freely.\\n\\nSet $ F(n) = 0 $ for all $ n \\\\geq 2 $. Then $ F(F(n)) = F(0) $, but $ F $ is defined on positive integers? Wait!\\n\\nThe sequence is $ F(1), F(2), \\\\ldots $, so domain is positive integers, $ \\\\mathbb{N} $, so $ n \\\\geq 1 $.\\nBut $ F(n) $ is non-negative integer, so can be 0.\\nBut when we write $ F(F(n)) $, if $ F(n) = 0 $, then $ F(0) $ is not defined!\\nOh! Critical point!\\n\\n$ F $ is defined only on positive integers: $ F(1), F(2), \\\\ldots $, so domain is $ \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ $.\\nBut $ F(n) $ is a non-negative integer, so it can be 0.\\nBut if $ F(n) = 0 $, then $ F(F(n)) = F(0) $, but 0 is not in the domain! $ F $ is not defined at 0.\\nContradiction!\\n\\nSo $ F(F(n)) $ is only defined if $ F(n) \\\\geq 1 $, because domain is positive integers.\\nBut the problem defines $ F(1), F(2), \\\\ldots $, so the domain is $ \\\\{1,2,3,\\\\ldots\\\\} $, so $ F(k) $ is only defined for $ k \\\\geq 1 $.\\nTherefore, for $ F(F(n)) $ to be defined, we must have $ F(n) \\\\geq 1 $.\\nBut $ F(n) $ is a non-negative integer, so this means $ F(n) \\\\geq 1 $ for all $ n $, i.e., $ F(n) $ is never 0.\\nBut condition (a) says that 0 occurs in the sequence.\\nContradiction!\\n\\nExactly!\\n\\nCondition (a): each of the integers $ 0,1,2,\\\\ldots $ occurs in the sequence.\\nSo there exists some $ k $ such that $ F(k) = 0 $.\\nBut then, for that $ k $, $ F(F(k)) = F(0) $, but $ F $ is not defined at 0, since the sequence starts at $ F(1) $.\\nTherefore, $ F(F(k)) $ is undefined.\\nBut the functional equation requires $ F(F(n^{163})) $ and $ F(F(n)) $ for $ n \\\\geq 2 $, which are defined only if $ F(n^{163}) \\\\geq 1 $ and $ F(n) \\\\geq 1 $, but more importantly, when we compute $ F(F(n)) $, we need $ F(n) $ to be at least 1.\\nBut if $ F(k) = 0 $ for some $ k $, then $ F(F(k)) $ is not defined, but the functional equation doesn't directly involve $ F(F(k)) $ unless $ k $ is of the form $ n^{163} $ or something, but the expression $ F(F(n)) $ appears in the equation for every $ n \\\\geq 2 $, so for those $ n $, $ F(F(n)) $ must be defined, so $ F(n) $ must be at least 1.\\nBut for the $ k $ where $ F(k) = 0 $, $ F(F(k)) $ is not defined, but the functional equation doesn't require it to be defined unless $ k \\\\geq 2 $ and we plug in $ n=k $, but if $ k \\\\geq 2 $, then for $ n=k $, the equation requires $ F(F(k^{163})) = F(F(k)) + F(F(361)) $, but $ F(F(k)) = F(0) $ is undefined.\\nEven if $ k=1 $, and $ F(1)=0 $, then if we ever need $ F(F(1)) $, but the equation is for $ n \\\\geq 2 $, so $ F(F(1)) $ is not required.\\nBut $ F(F(n)) $ for $ n \\\\geq 2 $ must be defined, so we need $ F(n) \\\\geq 1 $ for all $ n \\\\geq 2 $.\\nSimilarly, $ F(n^{163}) \\\\geq 1 $ for $ n \\\\geq 2 $, which is automatic if $ F(m) \\\\geq 1 $ for all $ m \\\\geq 2 $, since $ n^{163} \\\\geq 2 $.\\nBut $ F(1) $ could be 0.\\nNow, if $ F(1) = 0 $, then $ F(F(1)) = F(0) $ is undefined, but since the functional equation only involves $ n \\\\geq 2 $, and thus $ F(F(n)) $ for $ n \\\\geq 2 $, which requires $ F(n) \\\\geq 1 $ for $ n \\\\geq 2 $, but $ F(1) $ can be 0, and $ F(F(1)) $ is not used.\\nMoreover, 0 occurs in the sequence, namely at $ n=1 $.\\nSo is that allowed?\\nThe sequence includes $ F(1) = 0 $, so 0 occurs.\\nFor $ n \\\\geq 2 $, $ F(n) \\\\geq 1 $, so $ F(F(n)) $ is defined as long as $ F(n) \\\\geq 1 $, which it is, and since $ F(n) $ is a positive integer, $ F $ is defined there.\\nSo $ F(F(n)) $ is well-defined for $ n \\\\geq 2 $.\\nNo problem.\\nFor example, if $ F(1) = 0 $, and for $ n \\\\geq 2 $, $ F(n) \\\\geq 1 $, then $ F(F(n)) $ for $ n \\\\geq 2 $ is fine, since $ F(n) \\\\geq 1 $, so we apply $ F $ to a positive integer.\\nEven if $ F(n) = 1 $, $ F(1) = 0 $, so $ F(F(n)) = F(1) = 0 $, which is defined.\\n$ F(1) $ is defined, it's 0.\\nSo $ F(F(n)) = F(k) $ where $ k = F(n) \\\\geq 1 $, and since $ k \\\\geq 1 $, $ F(k) $ is defined.\\nSo even if $ F(k) = 0 $, it's fine; the value is 0, which is allowed.\\nThe output can be 0; the issue was input to $ F $.\\nAs long as the input to $ F $ is a positive integer, it's defined.\\nSo if $ F(n) = k \\\\geq 1 $, then $ F(k) $ is defined, regardless of what $ F(k) $ is.\\nAnd $ F(k) $ can be 0.\\nSo no problem with 0 being in the range.\\nFor example, $ F(1) = 0 $, $ F(2) = 1 $, then $ F(F(2)) = F(1) = 0 $, which is fine.\\nSo my earlier concern was unfounded.\\n0 can be in the range, as long as when we compose, the intermediate value is at least 1, but actually, the intermediate value is $ F(n) $, which needs to be in the domain, i.e., at least 1.\\nYes: for $ F(F(n)) $ to be defined, we need $ F(n) $ to be a positive integer, because the domain of $ F $ is positive integers.\\nSo $ F(n) \\\\geq 1 $ for all $ n $ such that $ F(F(n)) $ is to be computed.\\nIn the functional equation, for each $ n \\\\geq 2 $, $ F(F(n)) $ and $ F(F(n^{163})) $ must be defined, so we need $ F(n) \\\\geq 1 $ and $ F(n^{163}) \\\\geq 1 $ for all $ n \\\\geq 2 $.\\nSince $ n^{163} \\\\geq 2 $, this means that $ F(m) \\\\geq 1 $ for all $ m \\\\geq 2 $.\\nAdditionally, $ F(361) \\\\geq 1 $ since 361 ≥ 2.\\nNow, what about $ F(1) $? It could be 0, since we don't apply $ F $ after it in the equation, except possibly if some $ F(n) = 1 $, then $ F(F(n)) = F(1) $, which is defined as long as we define $ F(1) $.\\nAnd $ F(1) $ is part of the sequence, so it is defined.\\nSo if $ F(1) = 0 $, then when $ F(n) = 1 $, $ F(F(n)) = F(1) = 0 $, which is fine.\\nThe only requirement is that the argument to the outer $ F $ is at least 1, which it is, since $ F(n) \\\\geq 1 $ for $ n \\\\geq 2 $.\\nSo $ F(1) $ can be 0.\\nAnd 0 occurs in the sequence at position 1.\\nSo no problem.\\n\\nTherefore, the earlier obstacle is removed.\\n\\nNow, back to the functional equation.\\n\\nLet me try to see if c = 0 is possible.\\nSuppose c = 0, so F(F(361)) = 0.\\nBut F(F(361)) = G(361), and since 361 ≥ 2, F(361) ≥ 1, so G(361) = F(F(361)) is defined, and we can have it be 0, for example if F(k) = 0 for k = F(361).\\nBut F(k) = 0 only if k = 1, because for m ≥ 2, F(m) ≥ 1, but F(m) could be 1, and F(1) = 0.\\nSo if F(361) = 1, and F(1) = 0, then G(361) = F(1) = 0 = c.\\nGood.\\nThen the equation is G(n^{163}) = G(n) for all n ≥ 2.\\nSo F(F(n^{163})) = F(F(n)).\\nNow, can we define F such that this holds, and (a), (b) are satisfied?\\nFor example, make F(F(n)) constant for n ≥ 2.\\nSuppose we set F(n) = 1 for all n ≥ 2.\\nThen F(F(n)) = F(1) for n ≥ 2.\\nSet F(1) = 0.\\nThen G(n) = F(1) = 0 for all n ≥ 2.\\nSo G(n^{163}) = 0 = G(n), good.\\nc = G(361) = 0, good.\\nNow check (a): values in sequence: F(1) = 0, F(2) = 1, F(3) = 1, ..., so values are 0 and 1. But 2,3,4,... do not occur. So (a) fails.\\nTo satisfy (a), we need all non-negative integers to appear.\\nSo we need to have F(n) = k for every k ≥ 0.\\nBut F(n) = 0 only for n=1, say, but for n≥2, F(n) ≥1, and we need each positive integer to appear infinitely often.\\nSuppose we partition the positive integers.\\nSet F(1) = 0.\\nFor n ≥ 2, we need F(n) ≥ 1, and each positive integer appears infinitely often, and 0 appears (at n=1).\\nNow, G(n) = F(F(n)) for n≥2.\\nWe need G(n^{163}) = G(n) for all n≥2, if c=0.\\nSuppose we want G(n) to be constant, say G(n) = 0 for all n≥2.\\nThen F(F(n)) = 0 for all n≥2.\\nBut F(k) = 0 only if k=1, since for k≥2, F(k) ≥1, but F(k) could be 0 only if k=1, as F(m) for m≥2 is at least 1, but the value F(k) can be 0 only when k=1, because if k≥2, F(k) ≥1, so F(k) ≠ 0.\\nF(k) is the value, not the index.\\nF(k) = 0 means the output is 0.\\nWe have F(1) = 0.\\nCan F(k) = 0 for k≥2? Earlier we said for m≥2, F(m) ≥1, because otherwise if F(m) = 0 for m≥2, then for n=m≥2, F(F(n)) = F(0) undefined.\\nBut if F(m) = 0 for m≥2, then when we compute F(F(m)) = F(0), which is not defined, but for the functional equation, when n=m, we need F(F(m)) defined, so indeed, for all n≥2, F(n) must be at least 1, so that F(F(n)) is defined.\\nTherefore, F(n) ≥ 1 for all n ≥ 2.\\nMoreover, F(1) can be 0.\\nNow, F(k) = 0 only when k=1, because if k≥2, F(k) ≥1, so F(k) ≥1 >0, so F(k) ≠ 0 for k≥2.\\nTherefore, the only way to have F(F(n)) = 0 is if F(n) = 1, because then F(F(n)) = F(1) = 0.\\nIf F(n) = k ≥2, then F(k) ≥1, and since k≥2, F(k) ≥1, and in fact F(k) ≥1, but could it be 0? No, because for k≥2, F(k) ≥1, so F(k) ≥1, so F(F(n)) = F(k) ≥1 >0.\\nTherefore, F(F(n)) = 0 if and only if F(n) = 1.\\nOtherwise, if F(n) ≥2, then F(F(n)) ≥1.\\nNow, back to c = G(361) = F(F(361)).\\n361 ≥2, so F(361) ≥1.\\nIf F(361) = 1, then G(361) = F(1) = 0.\\nIf F(361) ≥2, then G(361) = F(F(361)) ≥1.\\nNow, if c = 0, then G(361) = 0, so F(361) = 1.\\nThen the equation is G(n^{163}) = G(n) for all n≥2.\\nNow, G(n) = F(F(n)) = 0 if F(n) = 1, and ≥1 if F(n) ≥2.\\nWe need this to be equal for n and n^{163}.\\nSuppose that for some n≥2, F(n) = 1, then G(n) = 0, so G(n^{163}) = 0, so F(n^{163}) = 1.\\nSimilarly, if F(n) ≥2, then G(n) ≥1, so G(n^{163}) ≥1, so F(n^{163}) ≥2.\\nBut no further restriction.\\nTo satisfy (a) and (b), we need all positive integers to appear infinitely often in the sequence.\\nSuppose we try to set F(n) = 1 for all n that are in the multiplicative semigroup generated by raising to 163, but it's complicated.\\nNote that the relation n ~ n^{163} generates equivalence classes.\\nFor example, start from n, go to n^{163}, n^{163^2}, etc., and also if m^{163} = n, then m = n^{1/163}, which may not be integer.\\nSo typically, each n has a forward orbit: n, n^{163}, n^{163^2}, ...\\nAnd these are infinite chains.\\nFor the functional equation with c=0, we need G constant on each such orbit.\\nSo for each n≥2, G(n) = G(n^{163}) = G(n^{163^2}) = \\cdots\\nNow, G(n) = F(F(n)) , which depends on F at F(n).\\nTo have all values appear, we can try to set F(n) = the 'height' or something, but perhaps it's possible.\\nBut let's consider if c > 0.\\nEarlier with c>0, G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c -> ∞.\\nBut G(n) = F(F(n)) , and F(n) for n≥2 is at least 1, and F(k) for k≥1 is defined.\\nNow, the range of G must include arbitrarily large values, so F must take arbitrarily large values, which is good for (a).\\nBut the problem is that G(n) must be defined, and for the orbit, it increases.\\nBut now, crucially, the values G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c must be in the range of F, since G(m) = F(F(m)) ≤ some bound if F is bounded, but F is not bounded.\\nBut more importantly, for the sequence to have each positive integer appear infinitely often, F must return to each value infinitely often.\\nBut in the orbit n^{163^k}, as k increases, G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c -> ∞, so it goes to infinity, so for large k, it is large, so it doesn't return to small values.\\nBut that's fine for G; G doesn't need to return to small values.\\nF itself needs to take each value infinitely often.\\nSo even if on this sparse sequence G is large, F can still take small values at other places.\\nSo no contradiction.\\nBut perhaps we can try to set c=0 and construct.\\nSuppose we set F(1) = 0.\\nFor n≥2, we need to define F(n) ≥1.\\nWe need F(F(n)) to be periodic under n -> n^{163} with period 1 in the exponent, i.e., invariant.\\nSuppose we ignore the functional equation first and ensure (a) and (b).\\nFor example, list all positive integers in a sequence that hits each infinitely often, like 1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,... but that's not sufficient.\\nStandard way: let F(n) = the largest k such that 2^k divides n, but that takes value 0 infinitely often, but we need F(n) ≥1 for n≥2, so not good.\\nDefine F(n) for n≥2 based on the highest power.\\nAnother idea: use the inverse of the pairing function, but complicated.\\nPerhaps it's easier to assume that no such sequence exists.\\nBut let's think about the number 361 = 19^2.\\nNotice that 163 and 361 are both constants.\\nAnother thought: suppose that the only way to satisfy the growth is if c=0, but with c=0, we may not achieve (a) and (b).\\nSuppose that for the function to have F(F(n)) constant on the orbit, but to have F take all values, it might be possible.\\nFor example, set for each n, let the orbit O_n = { n^{163^k} for k=0,1,2,... }.\\nThese orbits are disjoint for different 'base' n not a perfect 163-power.\\nFor n that is a perfect 163-power, say n = m^{163}, then n is in the orbit of m.\\nSo the orbits are parameterized by the '163-free' part.\\nFor example, each number can be written as a^{163^k} where a is not a perfect 163-power.\\nThen the orbit of a is { a^{163^m} for m≥0 }.\\nNow, on each such orbit, we need G(n) = F(F(n)) to be constant if c=0.\\nSo for all m, F(F(a^{163^m})) = c_a, a constant depending on a.\\nNow, F(a^{163^m}) is some value, say b_m, then F(b_m) = c_a.\\nSo F(b_m) = c_a for all m.\\nSo the value c_a is taken by F at the points b_m = F(a^{163^m}).\\nNow, b_m could be different for each m.\\nTo have F take all values, we can arrange that.\\nFor example, set c_a = 1 for all a.\\nThen we need F(F(a^{163^m})) = 1 for all a,m.\\nSo F(k) = 1 whenever k = F(a^{163^m}) for some a,m.\\nSo the set S = { F(n) for n≥2 } must be contained in the set where F(k) = 1.\\nBut S is the image of F on n≥2, which must include all positive integers except possibly 0, but 0 is at n=1, and for n≥2, F(n)≥1, and must include all positive integers infinitely often.\\nSo S must contain all positive integers.\\nTherefore, for every positive integer k, F(k) = 1.\\nBut then F is constantly 1 on positive integers, so F(1) = 1, but we wanted F(1) = 0 for 0 to appear, but if F(1) = 1, then 0 does not appear.\\nIf we set F(1) = 0, but for k≥2, F(k) = 1, then F(k) = 1 for k≥2, so for k=1, F(1) = 0, so F is not constantly 1.\\nBut for k=1, F(1) = 0 ≠ 1.\\nBut we need F(k) = 1 for all k that are in the image of F on n≥2.\\nBut if the image includes k=1, then F(1) must be 1, but we have F(1) = 0, contradiction.\\nSpecifically, since 1 must appear in the sequence (by (a)), and for n≥2, F(n)≥1, so there is some n≥2 such that F(n) = 1.\\nThen k = F(n) = 1, so F(k) = F(1) must be 1, because F(F(n)) = F(1) = c_a = 1.\\nBut if we want F(1) = 0, then F(1) = 0 ≠ 1, contradiction.\\nTherefore, if c=0 and we set c_a = 1, then F(1) must be 1.\\nBut then 0 does not appear in the sequence, since F(1) = 1, and for n≥2, F(n)≥1, so no n with F(n) = 0, so (a) fails.\\nIf we set c_a = 0 for all a, then F(F(n)) = 0 for all n≥2.\\nAs earlier, this implies F(n) = 1 for all n≥2, because only then F(F(n)) = F(1) = 0.\\nSo F(n) = 1 for all n≥2.\\nThen F(1) can be 0.\\nThen the sequence has F(1) = 0, F(n) = 1 for n≥2.\\nSo values are 0 and 1, missing 2,3,4,... so (a) fails.\\nIf we set c_a = k for some constant k, same issue.\\nSuppose we set c_a to depend on a.\\nFor example, let c_a = a.\\nThen for each a, on the orbit of a, F(F(a^{163^m})) = a.\\nSo F(b_m) = a, where b_m = F(a^{163^m}).\\nSo for each m, F at b_m is a.\\nNow, b_m could be chosen.\\nTo have F take all values, we can try to set the b_m appropriately.\\nBut also, F must be defined consistently.\\nMoreover, the image of F on n≥2 must include all positive integers, and each infinitely often.\\nSuppose for a given a, we set F(a^{163^m}) = c for all m, some constant c.\\nThen F(c) = a.\\nSo F(c) = a.\\nNow, c is fixed for the orbit, a varies.\\nFor different a, we have different c or same.\\nBut F(c) = a, so if c is the same for two different a, then F(c) = a1 and a2, impossible.\\nSo c must be different for each a.\\nBut there are infinitely many a (the 163-free numbers), and c must be a positive integer, so we can assign distinct c_a to each a.\\nFor example, enumerate the 163-free numbers as a1, a2, a3, ..., and set for orbit of ai, let c_i be a new integer not used before.\\nBut c_i is the value that F takes on the orbit.\\nFor the orbit of ai, we set F(ai^{163^m}) = c_i for all m.\\nThen F(c_i) = a_i.\\nNow, c_i must be a positive integer, and we need to choose c_i not conflicting.\\nAlso, the values F(n) for n in the orbit are c_i, so to have all positive integers appear, we need that the set {c_i} union {a_i} union {F(1)} covers all non-negative integers.\\nF(1) = 0.\\nValues in the sequence: for n=1, F(1) = 0.\\nFor n in some orbit, F(n) = c_i if n in orbit of ai.\\nAlso, for the points c_i, F(c_i) = a_i.\\nBut c_i may not be in any orbit yet; c_i is just an index.\\nWhen we define F at c_i, we have F(c_i) = a_i.\\nBut c_i itself may be in some orbit.\\nFor example, if c_i is a 163-free number, then it is in its own orbit, say aj for some j.\\nThen for that orbit, F(c_i^{163^m}) = c_j for all m.\\nBut we also have F(c_i) = a_i.\\nSo at n = c_i, which is in the orbit of aj, F(c_i) = c_j (from the orbit definition), but also F(c_i) = a_i, so c_j = a_i.\\nSo we need c_j = a_i.\\nBut j is such that aj = c_i, so a_j = c_i.\\nSo c_j = a_i, and a_j = c_i.\\nSo we have a_j = c_i, c_j = a_i.\\nSo the assignment must satisfy that for each i, if we set c_i, then when we consider the orbit of c_i, it must be consistent.\\nThis might be possible if we pair them properly, but it's messy.\\nMoreover, we need each positive integer to appear infinitely often in the sequence.\\nIn this construction, for a given value v, how many times does it appear as F(n)?\\nFor example, the value a_i appears as F(c_i) = a_i, so at n = c_i.\\nAlso, if a_i is in some orbit, F(a_i) = c_k for some k, so not a_i unless c_k = a_i.\\nTypically, a_i appears only once, at n=c_i.\\nBut we need it to appear infinitely often.\\nSimilarly, c_i appears as F(n) for n in the orbit of ai, which is infinite: for m=0,1,2,... , n = ai^{163^m}, F(n) = c_i.\\nSo c_i appears infinitely often, good.\\nBut a_i appears only at n=c_i, once, unless c_i is such that it appears elsewhere.\\nTo have a_i appear infinitely often, we need that there are infinitely many n with F(n) = a_i.\\nCurrently, only at n=c_i.\\nSo we need to have other n mapping to a_i.\\nBut in this construction, the only places are the orbit points and the c_i points.\\nAt c_i, F(c_i) = a_i, but c_i is one point.\\nUnless we make F take value a_i at other points.\\nBut the orbits cover all n≥2, so every n≥2 is in some orbit ai, and for that n, F(n) = c_i, not a_i.\\nSo the only place where F(n) = a_i is at n = c_i.\\nSo each a_i appears only once.\\nBut we need each positive integer to appear infinitely often, so this fails.\\nTo fix this, we could make the c_i not distinct, but then F(c) would need to be multiple values.\\nOr add more points, but all n≥2 are already assigned.\\nPerhaps set F(n) = a_i for some additional n, but all n are in orbits.\\nUnless we have n that are not in any orbit, but every n≥2 is in exactly one orbit.\\nSo no room.\\nTherefore, in this construction, the values a_i appear only once, not infinitely often.\\nSo (b) fails.\\nFor c>0, we have G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c -> ∞, so on each orbit, G takes infinitely many different values, so no problem with constancy, but still, we need to ensure that F takes each value infinitely often.\\nPerhaps it's possible, but complicated.\\nMaybe no such sequence exists.\\nAnother idea: suppose that F(F(n)) is eventually periodic or something, but with c>0, it grows linearly.\\nBut perhaps the only way is if c=0, but then G is bounded on each orbit, but to have F take all values infinitely often, it might be impossible with the functional equation.\\nPerhaps assume that such F exists, then from the equation G(n^{163}) = G(n) + c, with c = G(361) ≥0.\\nIf c=0, then G is constant on orbits.\\nIf c>0, G grows linearly on orbits.\\nNow, the number of n≤x is x.\\nThe number of orbits up to x is roughly x / log x or something, but each orbit has infinitely many points, but for n≤x, the number of n in a given orbit is about log log x / log 163, very sparse.\\nBut not helpful.\\nPerhaps the range of G must be such that it can be achieved.\\nBut let's calculate the value at 361.\\nLet n=361 in the equation.\\nThen G(361^{163}) = G(361) + c = c + c = 2c.\\nG(361^{163^2}) = G(361^{163}) + c = 2c + c = 3c, and so on.\\nSo G(361^{163^k}) = (k+1)c.\\nNow, 361^{163^k} is a specific sequence of integers.\\nG(m) = F(F(m)) , and F(m) for m in this sequence is some value, say d_k, then F(d_k) = (k+1)c.\\nSo F(d_k) = (k+1)c.\\nAs k->∞, (k+1)c -> ∞ if c>0.\\nSo F takes arbitrarily large values, good.\\nMoreover, the values (k+1)c are hit by F at d_k = F(361^{163^k}).\\nNow, d_k is a sequence of positive integers.\\nTo have each positive integer appear infinitely often in F, we need that for each v, there are infinitely many m with F(m) = v.\\nIn particular, for v = d_k, it may appear, but we need it to appear infinitely often, but d_k may be different for each k.\\nNo problem.\\nBut the key is that F(d_k) = (k+1)c, so at the points d_k, F takes the value (k+1)c.\\nIf c>0, these are distinct for large k, so F takes each value (k+1)c at least at d_k.\\nBut we need each value to be taken infinitely often, so for example, the value c must be taken infinitely often.\\nIt is taken at some points, but not necessarily at d_k.\\nSo as long as we arrange that, it might be possible.\\nPerhaps it is possible to construct.\\nBut maybe for the sake of time, and since the problem might expect a no, but let's think differently.\\nSuppose that c > 0.\\nThen G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c -> ∞.\\nBut G(n) = F(F(n)) ≥ 0.\\nNow, the values G(m) for m = n^{163^k} are distinct for large k if c>0, since it increases by c each time.\\nSo on this sequence, G takes infinitely many distinct values.\\nBut that's fine.\\nHowever, the rate: the argument m = n^{163^k} grows very fast, double exponentially, while G(m) grows linearly with k, so very slow.\\nBut no contradiction.\\nPerhaps the only constraint is that F must be such that F(F(n)) satisfies the equation, and meets the frequency conditions.\\nMaybe such a sequence exists.\\nFor example, set c = 1.\\nThen G(n^{163}) = G(n) + 1 for all n≥2.\\nThen G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k.\\nNow, set for each n≥2, let G(n) = v_n, then G(n^{163^k}) = v_n + k.\\nNow, G(m) = F(F(m)), so we need to define F such that this holds.\\nAlso, F(n) ≥1 for n≥2, F(1) = 0 say.\\nNow, for a given m, if m = n^{163^k} for some n not a 163-power, then G(m) = G(n) + k.\\nG(n) can be chosen as a constant for the base n.\\nFor example, for each 163-free a, set G(a) = c_a.\\nThen for m = a^{163^k}, G(m) = c_a + k.\\nNow, G(m) = F(F(m)), so F(F(a^{163^k})) = c_a + k.\\nNow, let b_k = F(a^{163^k}), then F(b_k) = c_a + k.\\nSo for each k, F at b_k is c_a + k.\\nNow, b_k is some positive integer.\\nWe need to choose b_k such that the values are consistent and cover all requirements.\\nAlso, the b_k may overlap for different a or k.\\nTo avoid conflict, we can choose b_k to be distinct across all a,k.\\nFor example, use a pairing function to assign unique indices.\\nThen set F(b_k) = c_a + k.\\nAlso, for the points in the orbit, F(a^{163^k}) = b_k.\\nNow, for the points b_k, we have defined F(b_k) = c_a + k.\\nBut b_k itself may be in some orbit.\\nIf b_k is 163-free, then it is in its own orbit, say for b_k = d, then for its orbit, we have defined F(d^{163^m}) = b'_m for some b'_m, but we already have F(b_k) = c_a + k, so at n=b_k, F(n) is already defined as c_a + k, but if b_k is in the orbit of d, then F(b_k) should be b'_0 for that orbit, so we need b'_0 = c_a + k.\\nSo again, consistency issue.\\nTo resolve, we can set the b_k to not be 163-free, but rather to be high powers, but it's messy.\\nPerhaps set the b_k to be numbers that are not in the domain in a way, but all are.\\nMaybe give up and conclude that it does not exist.\\nPerhaps the answer is no.\\nAnother idea: suppose that F(F(n)) is bounded.\\nThen from G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c, if c>0, it -> ∞, contradiction, so c=0, and G is bounded.\\nIf c=0, G is constant on orbits, so bounded on each orbit, but could be unbounded overall if c_a -> ∞.\\nBut in our earlier attempt, we had issues with frequency.\\nSuppose that G is bounded, say |G(n)| ≤ M for all n.\\nThen from G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) + k c, if c>0, for k > M/c, it > M, contradiction.\\nSo c=0, and G(n^{163^k}) = G(n) for all k.\\nSo G is constant on each orbit.\\nSince the orbit is infinite, and G is constant on it.\\nNow, G(n) = F(F(n)) .\\nAs before, the values that G takes are limited.\\nBut more importantly, for the sequence to have each positive integer appear infinitely often, consider that for a fixed k, the set { n : F(n) = k } is infinite.\\nThen for such n, G(n) = F(k), a constant.\\nSo G(n) = F(k) for infinitely many n.\\nSo each value in the range of F appears as G(n) for infinitely many n.\\nIn particular, since range of F is all non-negative integers, every non-negative integer v appears as G(n) for infinitely many n.\\nBut if G is constant on each orbit, and there are infinitely many orbits, G could take many values.\\nBut on each orbit, G is constant, say c_orbit.\\nAnd each c_orbit is hit infinitely many times on that orbit.\\nSo as long as the set of c_orbit includes all non-negative integers, and each c_orbit is used for infinitely many orbits or something, but each c_orbit is for one orbit, and on that orbit, it is hit infinitely many times, so for the value c_orbit, it is hit infinitely many times (on its orbit), so if the set of c_orbit is all non-negative integers, then each v is hit infinitely many times as G(n).\\nBut we need each v to be hit infinitely many times as F(n), not as G(n).\\nG(n) = F(F(n)), so it's different.\\nFor F(n) to be v, it's separate.\\nSo no direct conflict.\\nFor example, we can have G(n) = 0 for all n, but then F(F(n)) = 0, which implies F(n) = 1 and F(1) = 0, so F(n) = 1 for n≥2, F(1) = 0, then F(n) takes only 0 and 1, not other values.\\nTo have F(n) = v for v>1, we need to have it in the sequence.\\nSuppose we want F(n) = 2 for some n.\\nSay for some n in some orbit, F(n) = 2.\\nThen G(n) = F(2).\\nIf the orbit has constant G, say c_a, then F(2) = c_a.\\nSimilarly, if another m has F(m) = 2, then G(m) = F(2) = c_b for its orbit, so c_a = c_b, so all orbits where 2 is in the image must have the same G-value.\\nBut it's complicated.\\nPerhaps it's possible, but given the time, and since the first problem is done, for the second problem, maybe the answer is no.\\nI recall that in some similar problems, the existence is impossible because of the growth rate or the frequency.\\nPerhaps assume that such F exists, then from the equation, for n=2, G(2^{163^k}) = G(2) + k c.\\nLeft side is F(F(2^{163^k})), which is at least 0.\\nRight side -> ∞ if c>0.\\nNow, F(F(2^{163^k})) = some value.\\nBut also, by (b), the value 1 appears infinitely often, so there are infinitely many m with F(m) = 1.\\nThen for those m, G(m) = F(1).\\nSo G(m) = F(1) for infinitely many m.\\nSimilarly for any fixed k, if F(m) = k, then G(m) = F(k), a constant.\\nSo for each k, the value F(k) is taken by G(m) for all m with F(m) = k.\\nSince there are infinitely many such m (by (b), for k≥1), so each F(k) for k≥1 is taken by G at infinitely many points.\\nF(1) is taken infinitely many times by G.\\nNow, if c>0, then on the sequence m_k = 2^{163^k}, G(m_k) = G(2) + k c -> ∞, so for large k, G(m_k) > F(1), and in fact larger than any fixed number.\\nBut that's fine.\\nThe values G(m_k) are distinct for large k, so they are new values.\\nBut each value that G takes must be F(k) for some k, and must be taken infinitely many times by G, because for each v in the range of F, v = F(k) for some k, and then G(m) = v for all m with F(m) = k, and there are infinitely many such m, so yes, every value in the range of F is taken infinitely many times by G.\\nMoreover, since range of F is all non-negative integers, every non-negative integer v appears infinitely many times in the sequence G(1), G(2), ... wait, G is only defined for n≥2 in the equation, but for n=1, G(1) = F(F(1)) may not be defined if F(1)=0, but for n≥2, G(n) is defined.\\nAnd for n≥2, G(n) = F(F(n)) , and as above, each v in range of F appears infinitely many times in {G(n)}_{n≥2}.\\nNow, if c>0, then on the sequence m_k = 2^{163^k}, G(m_k) = G(2) + k c, which is an arithmetic sequence with difference c>0, so for large k, it is strictly increasing, so all values are distinct for k large enough.\\nTherefore, there are infinitely many distinct values in the sequence G(m_k).\\nBut each of these values must be in the range of F, and moreover, each such value w = G(m_k) must appear infinitely many times in the sequence {G(n)}_{n≥2}.\\nBut in the sequence G(m_k), the values are distinct for large k, so each w appears only once in this sequence, but it may appear elsewhere.\\nSince it must appear infinitely many times in the full sequence G(n), there must be infinitely many other n where G(n) = w.\\nFor each k large, the value w_k = G(2) + k c must appear infinitely many times in {G(n)}_{n≥2}.\\nThis is possible in principle, as long as we have enough n.\\nFor example, for each w_k, there are infinitely many n with G(n) = w_k.\\nNo contradiction.\\nTherefore, it might be possible.\\nPerhaps the answer is yes.\\nGiven the complexity, and since the first problem is clear, for the second problem, I think it does exist, but I'm not sure.\\nPerhaps the number 163 and 361 are chosen because 361 = 19^2, 163 is prime, but not helpful.\\nAnother thought: if we set F(n) = 0 for all n, but then F(F(n)) undefined.\\nOr if we set F(n) = k for all n, then as before, only works if k=0, but then undefined.\\nPerhaps set F(n) = the constant c, but same issue.\\nI recall that in some olympiad problems, such functional equations with iteration have solutions.\\nPerhaps set F(n) = floor(log log n) or something, but may not work.\\nFor the sake of time, and since the first problem is done, and for the second, perhaps the answer is no because of the initial condition.\\nLet's box the answers as per the first problem.\\nFrom Problem 1, we have kappa = 0.\\nFor Problem 2, after thinking, I think it does not exist, because of the following: in the sequence m_k = n^{163^k}, the values G(m_k) = G(n) + k c.\\nIf c>0, this -> ∞, and the values are distinct for large k.\\nEach such value w_k = G(n) + k c must be in the range of F, and must be taken infinitely many times by F, by (b).\\nBut also, for G to take the value w_k, it must be that F(F(m)) = w_k, which requires that F(m) is in the preimage of w_k under F.\\nSince w_k is large, and F takes each value infinitely often, the preimage is infinite, so plenty of m with F(m) = k for k such that F(k) = w_k.\\nBut the issue is that w_k is different for each k, so no problem.\\nPerhaps it is possible.\\nMaybe the answer is yes.\\nI found a way: suppose we set c = 0.\\nThen G(n^{163}) = G(n) for all n≥2.\\nNow, set F(1) = 0.\\nFor n≥2, set F(n) = 1 if n is not a perfect 163-power, and if n = m^{163} for some m, then set F(n) = F(m) + 1 or something.\\nBut then for n = m^{163}, F(n) = F(m) + 1.\\nThen G(n) = F(F(n)) = F(F(m) + 1).\\nG(m) = F(F(m)).\\nWe need G(n) = G(m), so F(F(m) + 1) = F(F(m)).\\nSo F(k+1) = F(k) for k = F(m).\\nSo if the range of F on n≥2 is all integers greater than some number, then F(k+1) = F(k) for all k in range, so F is constant on large k, say F(k) = c for k≥K.\\nThen for large m, F(m) = c, so G(m) = F(c) = d, constant.\\nThen for the functional equation, if c=0, need d = d, good.\\nBut to have all values appear, we can set F(n) = v for v=1,2,3,... in some order, but with the recurrence.\\nFor example, for n not a 163-power, F(n) = 1.\\nFor n = m^{163}, F(n) = F(m) + 1.\\nThen for example, F(2) = 1 (since 2 not 163-power), F(2^{163}) = F(2) + 1 = 2, F(2^{163^2}) = F(2^{163}) + 1 = 3, and so on.\\nSo for the orbit of 2, F(2^{163^k}) = k+1.\\nThen G(2^{163^k}) = F(F(2^{163^k})) = F(k+1).\\nNow, k+1 may be large, and if k+1 is not a 163-power, F(k+1) = 1, so G = 1.\\nIf k+1 is a 163-power, say k+1 = m^{163}, then F(k+1) = F(m) + 1.\\nBut for most k, k+1 is not a 163-power, so F(k+1) = 1, so G = 1.\\nAt n=2, G(2) = F(F(2)) = F(1) = 0.\\nBut we need G(n^{163}) = G(n), so G(2^{163}) = G(2) = 0, but G(2^{163}) = F(F(2^{163})) = F(2) = 1 (since 2 not 163-power), so 1, not 0. Contradiction.\\nSo not good.\\nTo make G constant, set F(n) = c for all n≥2, then G(n) = F(c), constant, good if c=0, but then F(n) = c for n≥2, so if c=1, F(n) =1 for n≥2, F(1)=0, then G(n) = F(1) =0 for n≥2, so c=0, good, but then only values 0,1, not others.\\nSo cannot.\\nTherefore, perhaps no such sequence exists.\\nI think the answer is no.\\nSo I'll go with that.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"no\"\n}",
