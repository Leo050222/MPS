Perhaps there's a better way.\\n\\nWait — after $t=1$ to $9$, we had $R = 67/17$\\n\\nNow, $67/17 = \\\\frac{67}{17}$, and $\\\\frac{t+1}{t} = \\\\frac{67}{17}$ would require $t = 17$, $\\\\frac{18}{17} \\\\approx 1.0588$, but $67/17 \\\\approx 3.94$, so we need more than one term.\\n\\nBut notice: $67/17 = \\\\frac{67}{17}$, and suppose we take $t = 17$: $\\\\frac{18}{17}$\\n\\nThen $R := (67/17) / (18/17) = 67/18 \\\\approx 3.722$\\n\\nThen $t=18$: $19/18 \\\\approx 1.0556$, $R := 67/18 / 19/18 = 67/19 \\\\approx 3.526$\\n\\nNot helping.\\n\\nAlternative idea: the product\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\prod \\\\frac{t_i + 1}{t_i} = \\\\frac{\\\\prod (t_i + 1)}{\\\\prod t_i} = \\\\frac{670}{17}\\n$$\\n\\nSuppose the set of $t_i$ is $\\\\{1,2,3,\\\\ldots,k\\\\}$ except for some omissions, and possibly additions.\\n\\nNote that:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\prod_{t=1}^m \\\\frac{t+1}{t} = \\\\frac{2}{1} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\cdots \\\\frac{m+1}{m} = m+1\\n$$\\n\\nTelescoping! So if we take $t=1$ to $m$, then $\\\\prod \\\\frac{t_i+1}{t_i} = m+1$\\n\\nWe want this to be $670/17 \\\\approx 39.4118$, so $m+1 \\\\approx 39.41$, so $m=39$ gives product 40, which is too big.\\n\\nBut 40 > 39.4118, so perhaps remove some terms and/or replace.\\n\\nThe full product from $t=1$ to $39$ is $40$.\\n\\nWe want $670/17 = 670 \\\\div 17 = 39.4117647...$\\n\\nSo $40 / x = 670/17$ → $x = 40 \\\\cdot 17 / 670 = 680 / 670 = 68/67$\\n\\nSo if we take the full product from $t=1$ to $39$, which is 40, and divide by $68/67$, we get $40 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{67}{68} = \\\\frac{2680}{68} = \\\\frac{670}{17}$, perfect!\\n\\nBut dividing by $68/67$ means we do *not* include a term $\\\\frac{68}{67}$, but wait — the product is multiplicative, so to reduce the total product by a factor of $68/67$, we need to *exclude* a factor of $68/67$, but the factors are $\\\\frac{t+1}{t}$ for $t$ in the set.\\n\\nCurrently, with $t=1$ to $39$, product is $40$.\\n\\nWe want product $670/17 = 40 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{67}{68}$\\n\\nSo we need to multiply by $\\\\frac{67}{68}$, which is less than 1, meaning we must *exclude* some terms or include extra ones? No — we can only include terms, each $>1$.\\n\\nAlternatively, instead of including all $t=1$ to $39$, we exclude one $t$ such that $\\\\frac{t+1}{t} = \\\\frac{68}{67}$, but $\\\\frac{t+1}{t} = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{t} = \\\\frac{68}{67} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{t} = \\\\frac{1}{67} \\\\Rightarrow t=67$\\n\\nBut $t=67$ is not in $1$ to $39$, so we cannot exclude it.\\n\\nWe want to *reduce* the product from 40 to $40 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{67}{68}$, so we need to divide by $\\\\frac{68}{67}$, i.e., not include a factor of $\\\\frac{68}{67}$, but again, $t=67$ not in range.\\n\\nAlternatively, we can achieve the ratio by removing a different factor.\\n\\nSuppose we take $t=1$ to $39$ except $t=k$, then the product is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\prod_{t=1}^{39} \\\\frac{t+1}{t}}{\\\\frac{k+1}{k}} = \\\\frac{40}{\\\\frac{k+1}{k}} = 40 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{k}{k+1}\\n$$\\n\\nSet this equal to $670/17$:\\n\\n$$\\n40 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{k}{k+1} = \\\\frac{670}{17}\\n\\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{k}{k+1} = \\\\frac{670}{17 \\\\cdot 40} = \\\\frac{670}{680} = \\\\frac{67}{68}\\n\\\\Rightarrow 68k = 67(k+1) \\\\Rightarrow 68k = 67k + 67 \\\\Rightarrow k = 67\\n$$\\n\\nSo if we take $t=1$ to $39$ except $t=67$, but $67 > 39$, so $t=67$ is not in the set, so we cannot exclude it.\\n\\nThus, we cannot obtain the product by removing one term from $1$ to $39$.\\n\\nBut what if we take $t=1$ to $67$ except $t=39$?\\n\\nProduct from $t=1$ to $67$ is $68$.\\n\\nRemove $t=k$: product becomes $68 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{k}{k+1}$\\n\\nSet equal to $670/17$:\\n\\n$$\\n68 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{k}{k+1} = \\\\frac{670}{17}\\n\\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{k}{k+1} = \\\\frac{670}{17 \\\\cdot 68} = \\\\frac{670}{1156} = \\\\frac{335}{578}\\n\\\\Rightarrow k \\\\cdot 578 = 335(k+1) \\\\Rightarrow 578k = 335k + 335 \\\\Rightarrow 243k = 335 \\\\Rightarrow k = 335/243 \\\\approx 1.378$, not integer.\\n\\nNot good.\\n\\nBack to earlier: after including $t=1$ to $9$, we had $R = 67/17$\\n\\nNow, $67/17 = \\\\frac{67}{17}$, and we need to write this as a product of $\\\\frac{t_i+1}{t_i}$ for $t_i > 9$, distinct.\\n\\nNote that $\\\\frac{67}{17} = \\\\frac{67}{17}$, and if we take $t=17$, $\\\\frac{18}{17}$, then $R := (67/17) / (18/17) = 67/18$\\n\\nThen $t=18$: $19/18$, $R := 67/18 / 19/18 = 67/19$\\n\\nContinue: $t=19$: $20/19$, $R := 67/19 / 20/19 = 67/20$\\n\\n...\\nAfter $t=66$: $67/66$, $R := 67/66 / 67/66 = 1$\\n\\nFrom $t=17$ to $t=66$, that's $66 - 17 + 1 = 50$ terms.\\n\\nAnd we already have $t=1$ to $9$: 9 terms.\\n\\nTotal $n = 9 + 50 = 59$ terms.\\n\\nBut is this minimal? Probably not, but let's see what the product is.\\n\\nWith $t=1$ to $9$: product $\\\\prod_{t=1}^9 \\\\frac{t+1}{t} = 10$\\n\\nThen $t=17$ to $66$: $\\\\prod_{t=17}^{66} \\\\frac{t+1}{t} = \\\\frac{18}{17} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{19}{18} \\\\cdots \\\\frac{67}{66} = \\\\frac{67}{17}$\\n\\nSo total product: $10 \\\\times \\\\frac{67}{17} = \\\\frac{670}{17}$, perfect!\\n\\nAnd the $t_i$ are $1,2,\\\\ldots,9,17,18,\\\\ldots,66$ — all distinct, since 10 to 16 are missing.\\n\\nNow, recall $t_i = s_i - 1$, so $s_i = t_i + 1$\\n\\nThus, the set of $s_i$ is:\\n\\n$\\\\{2,3,4,\\\\ldots,10\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\{18,19,\\\\ldots,67\\\\}$\\n\\nBecause $t=1 \\\\to s=2$, $t=9 \\\\to s=10$, $t=17 \\\\to s=18$, $t=66 \\\\to s=67$\\n\\nSo $s_i$ ranges from 2 to 10 (9 values) and 18 to 67 (67-18+1=50 values), total 59.\\n\\nMaximum $s$ is 67.\\n\\nNow, the problem says: “instead of determining the least positive integer $n$ ... simply find $d = s - 67$, where $s$ is the maximum element in such a minimal set.”\\n\\nHere, $s = 67$, so $d = 67 - 67 = 0$.\\n\\nBut is this the minimal $n$? We have $n=59$, but maybe there's a smaller $n$ with larger maximum $s$.\\n\\nThe instruction says “in such a minimal set”, meaning a set achieving the minimal $n$.\\n\\nBut we don't know if $n=59$ is minimal.\\n\\nPerhaps we can do better.\\n\\nNotice that in the product $\\\\prod \\\\frac{t_i+1}{t_i} = \\\\frac{670}{17}$, and we achieved it with $t_i = 1$ to $9$ and $17$ to $66$.\\n\\nThe missing $t$ are 10,11,12,13,14,15,16 — seven values.\\n\\nIs there a way to include fewer terms?\\n\\nAnother idea: since $\\\\frac{670}{17} = \\\\frac{67 \\\\times 10}{17}$, and we have $\\\\prod \\\\frac{t_i+1}{t_i} = \\\\frac{\\\\prod (t_i+1)}{\\\\prod t_i}$, so we want $\\\\frac{\\\\prod (t_i+1)}{\\\\prod t_i} = \\\\frac{670}{17}$\\n\\nThis resembles a ratio of factorials if the sets are intervals.\\n\\nSuppose we take $t_i$ from $a$ to $b$, then product is $\\\\frac{b+1}{a}$\\n\\nBut here we have two intervals.\\n\\nIn our case, we have $\\\\frac{10}{1} \\\\times \\\\frac{67}{17} = \\\\frac{670}{17}$, as above.\\n\\nCould we use a single interval? $\\\\frac{b+1}{a} = \\\\frac{670}{17} \\\\approx 39.4118$, so $b+1 = 670k$, $a = 17k$ for some $k$, but then $t_i$ from $17k$ to $670k -1$, number of terms $(670k -1) - 17k +1 = 653k$, large.\\n\\nFor $k=1$, $a=17$, $b+1=670$, $b=669$, number of terms $669-17+1=653$, much worse than 59.\\n\\nSo multiple intervals are better.\\n\\nCan we reduce the number of terms?\\n\\nNotice that the gap between 9 and 17 is 7 numbers (10 to 16). If we could fill part of the gap with fewer terms, but each term adds a factor greater than 1, so it might allow us to stop earlier.\\n\\nBut in our construction, after $t=1$ to $9$, we have product 10, need additional $67/17 \\\\approx 3.941$, and we achieve that with 50 terms from $t=17$ to $66$.\\n\\nThe minimal number of terms to achieve a product of $P$ is roughly $\\\\log P / \\\\log(\\\\max \\\\text{factor})$, but since factors decrease, it's complicated.\\n\\nBut perhaps 59 is not minimal, but the problem asks for $d = s - 67$, implying that in the minimal set, the maximum $s$ might be 67 or close.\\n\\nMoreover, in our set, max $s_i = 67$, and $d = 0$.\\n\\nBut let's verify the original product.\\n\\nWe have $s_i = t_i + 1$, so for $t_i$ in $1$ to $9$: $s_i = 2$ to $10$\\n\\n$1 - 1/s_i = (s_i -1)/s_i = t_i / (t_i +1)$\\n\\nEarlier we had $\\\\prod (1 - 1/s_i) = \\\\prod \\\\frac{t_i}{t_i +1}$\\n\\nBut we computed $\\\\prod \\\\frac{t_i +1}{t_i} = \\\\frac{670}{17}$, so $\\\\prod \\\\frac{t_i}{t_i +1} = \\\\frac{17}{670}$, correct.\\n\\nAnd $s_i$ are distinct: 2 to 10 and 18 to 67 — missing 11 to 17, so 67 is included.\\n\\nMax $s = 67$.\\n\\nNow, is there a set with smaller $n$? Suppose we try to use larger $t_i$ with bigger jumps.\\n\\nFor example, use $t=1$: factor 2, reduces $R$ from ~39.4 to ~19.7\\n$t=2$: 1.5, to ~13.13\\n... same as before.\\n\\nOr skip some small ones.\\n\\nSuppose we don't use $t=1$, then the largest factor is $3/2=1.5$, and $1.5^n = 39.4$ → $n \\\\log 1.5 = \\\\log 39.4$ → $n \\\\approx \\\\log 39.4 / \\\\log 1.5 \\\\approx 3.67 / 0.405 \\\\approx 9.06$, so at least 10 terms, but this is for equal factors, but since factors decrease, need more.\\n\\nWith $t=2$ to $k$, product $\\\\frac{k+1}{2}$, set equal to $670/17 \\\\approx 39.41$, so $k+1 = 78.82$, $k=77.82$, so $t=2$ to $77$, 76 terms, worse than 59.\\n\\nInclude $t=1$ and others.\\n\\nOur construction has 59 terms, which seems reasonable.\\n\\nBut notice that in the set, we have $s_i$ up to 67, and the problem mentions 67, so likely $s=67$ is intended.\\n\\nMoreover, the fraction was $51/2010 = 17/670$, and 670 = 10×67, 17 prime, so 67 appears.\\n\\nPerhaps the minimal set must include $s=67$ or something.\\n\\nAnother thought: in the product $\\\\prod (1 - 1/s_i) = 17/670$, the denominator 670 suggests that in the combined fraction, the denominator might be related to the lcm or product of $s_i$, but not necessarily.\\n\\nBut in our case, with $s_i$ up to 67, and 67 is prime, so if 67 is not in any $s_i$, then $1 - 1/s_i$ has denominator not divisible by 67, so the product might not have 67 in denominator, but 670 = 2×5×67, so 67 must appear in the denominator of the product, which comes from the $s_i$ in the denominators.\\n\\nSpecifically, in $\\\\prod \\\\frac{s_i - 1}{s_i}$, the denominator is $\\\\prod s_i$, so for 67 to divide the denominator, some $s_i$ must be divisible by 67, but since $s_i$ are positive integers, the smallest is 67 itself.\\n\\nMoreover, $s_i = 67k$ for $k \\\\geq 2$ would be at least 134, larger.\\n\\nBut $s_i$ could be 67, or 134, etc.\\n\\nIf $s_i = 67$, then $1 - 1/67 = 66/67$, which contributes 67 to the denominator.\\n\\nIf $s_i = 134$, $1 - 1/134 = 133/134 = 133/(2×67)$, still has 67 in denominator.\\n\\nBut to minimize the maximum $s$, probably best to take $s_i = 67$.\\n\\nSimilarly, for numerator, 17 is prime, so some $s_i - 1$ must be divisible by 17, so $s_i \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{17}$, smallest is 18, then 35, etc.\\n\\nBut in our construction, we have $s_i = 18$ (from $t=17$), so $s_i - 1 = 17$, so numerator has 17.\\n\\nNow, back to the denominator: the entire product has denominator dividing $\\\\prod s_i$, and we need the reduced denominator to be divisible by 67, so some $s_i$ must be divisible by 67, hence $\\\\max s_i \\\\geq 67$.\\n\\nSimilarly, since $s_i$ are distinct positive integers, the smallest possible maximum is at least 67.\\n\\nIn our construction, we achieved $\\max s_i = 67$, so it is minimal possible.\\n\\nTherefore, in any such set, $\\max s_i \\geq 67$, and we have a set with $\\max s_i = 67$, so for the minimal $n$ set, $\\max s_i = 67$, hence $d = s - 67 = 0$.\\n\\nEven if there is a set with smaller $n$ but larger maximum, the problem says “such a minimal set”, meaning a set that achieves the minimal $n$, and among those, we take the maximum $s$, but since we may not know if 59 is minimal, but crucially, since $\\max s_i \\geq 67$ always, and we have a set with $\\max s_i = 67$, then in any minimal $n$ set, $\\max s_i \\geq 67$, but it could be larger.\\n\\nHowever, the problem asks for $d = s - 67$ where $s$ is the maximum in such a minimal set. But if there are multiple minimal sets with different maxima, but since 67 is the minimum possible maximum, any minimal $n$ set must have $\\max s_i \\geq 67$, but to minimize $n$, it might be beneficial to use larger $s_i$ to get closer factors, but in this case, since we already achieve the bound, likely the minimal $n$ set also has $\\max s_i = 67$.\\n\\nMoreover, in our construction, we have $n=59$, and it's hard to imagine a much smaller $n$, but regardless, since $\\max s_i \\geq 67$ for any such set, and we have one with equality, then for the purpose of $d = s - 67$, if the minimal $n$ set has $s \\geq 67$, $d \\geq 0$, but the problem likely expects $d=0$.\\n\\nFurthermore, the hint in the problem says “instead of finding n, find d=s-67”, suggesting that s=67 is expected.\\n\\nSo I think $d=0$.\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 1: 0\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nFind polynomials $P(x,y)$ such that:\\n\\na.) $P(tx, ty) = t^n P(x,y)$ for some fixed positive integer $n$, all real $t,x,y$.\\n\\nThis means $P$ is homogeneous of degree $n$.\\n\\nb.)

Earlier: in $P(y+z,x)$, we have $b x y^2$ from $b x y^2$\\n- $P(z+x,y)$: $c x y^2$\\nTotal: $3 + b + c$\\n\\nSimilarly, all quadratic terms will have coefficient $3 + b + c$ or similar.\\n\\nNow $x z^2$:\\n- $P(x+y,z)$: $c x z^2$\\n- $P(y+z,x)$: $b x z^2$\\n- $P(z+x,y)$: $3 x z^2$\\nTotal: $c + b + 3$\\n\\nSame for others.\\n\\nNow $x y z$:\\n- $P(x+y,z)$: $2b x y z$\\n- $P(y+z,x)$: $2b x y z$\\n- $P(z+x,y)$: $2b x y z$\\nTotal: $6b$\\n\\nNow, the sum is:\\n\\n$(2+d)(x^3 + y^3 + z^3) + (3 + b + c)(x^2 y + x^2 z + x y^2 + y^2 z + x z^2 + y z^2) + 6b  x y z$\\n\\nNote that $x^2 y + x y^2$ etc. are all present.\\n\\nSet this equal to 0 for all $x,y,z$.\\n\\nSo coefficients must be zero:\\n\\n1. $2 + d = 0$ ⇒ $d = -2$\\n\\n2. $3 + b + c = 0$ ⇒ $b + c = -3$\\n\\n3. $6b = 0$ ⇒ $b = 0$\\n\\nThen $c = -3$\\n\\nSo $P(x,y) = x^3 + 0*x^2 y -3 x y^2 -2 y^3 = x^3 - 3x y^2 - 2 y^3$\\n\\nNow check $P(1,0) = 1$, good.\\n\\nSo solution for $n=3$.\\n\\nNow $n=4$.\\n\\nLet $P(x,y) = x^4 + a x^3 y + b x^2 y^2 + c x y^3 + d y^4$  (since $P(1,0)=1$)\\n\\nNow compute the sum $S = P(x+y,z) + P(y+z,x) + P(z+x,y)$\\n\\nThis will be messy, but by symmetry, we can collect terms.\\n\\nSince it must be identically zero, and symmetric in a way, but not completely symmetric.\\n\\nAssume that $P(x,y)$ is of the form $x^n - n x^{n-2} y^2 - 2 y^n$ or something, but from previous:\\n\\nn=1: $x - 2y$\\n\\nn=2: $x^2 - x y - 2 y^2$\\n\\nn=3: $x^3 - 3x y^2 - 2 y^3$\\n\\nNotice that for n=1,2,3, we have a pattern?\\n\\nn=1: $x - 2y$\\n\\nn=2: $x^2 - x y - 2 y^2$\\n\\nn=3: $x^3 - 3x y^2 - 2 y^3$\\n\\nThe $-2 y^n$ is common.\\n\\nThe other term: for n=1: $x$, for n=2: $x^2 - x y$, for n=3: $x^3 - 3x y^2$\\n\\nNote that $x^3 - 3x y^2 = x(x^2 - 3y^2)$, not standard.\\n\\nObserve that in n=3, $x^3 - 3x y^2 = \\\\text{Re}((x+iy)^3)$ or something, but perhaps not.\\n\\nAnother idea: set $y=0$ in the functional equation.\\n\\nIf $y=0$, then $P(a+b, c) + P(b+c, a) + P(c+a, 0) = 0$\\n\\nBut $P(c+a, 0)$: since $P$ is homogeneous, $P(u,0) = c u^n$ for some $c$, but $P(1,0)=1$, so $P(u,0) = u^n$\\n\\nSimilarly, $P(v,w)$ when w=0 is $v^n$.\\n\\nSo when $y=0$:\\n\\n$P(a+b, c) + P(b+c, a) + (c+a)^n = 0$\\n\\nSimilarly, this must hold for all $a,b,c$.\\n\\nFor example, in n=1: $P(a+b,c) = a+b -2c$, $P(b+c,a) = b+c -2a$, $P(c+a,0) = c+a$\\n\\nSum: $(a+b-2c) + (b+c-2a) + (c+a) = (a -2a + a) + (b + b) + (-2c + c + c) = 0 + 2b + 0 = 2b$, not zero? Wait, mistake.\\n\\nWhen $y=0$, the equation is:\\n\\n$P(a+b, c) + P(b+c, a) + P(c+a, b)$ but $b$ is the variable, set to 0? No.\\n\\nThe variables are $a,b,c$, and we set one of them to 0, but in the expression, all are used.\\n\\nSet $b=0$.\\n\\nThen the equation becomes:\\n\\n$P(a+0, c) + P(0+c, a) + P(c+a, 0) = P(a,c) + P(c,a) + (c+a)^n = 0$\\n\\nSo for all $a,c$:\\n\\n$P(a,c) + P(c,a) + (a+c)^n = 0$\\n\\nThis is a key relation.\\n\\nSo $P(a,c) + P(c,a) = - (a+c)^n$\\n\\nFor each $n$, this must hold.\\n\\nAlso, $P$ is homogeneous of degree $n$.\\n\\nNow, for our earlier solutions:\\n\\nn=1: $P(x,y)=x-2y$, $P(y,x)=y-2x$, sum: $x-2y + y-2x = -x -y = -(x+y)$, and $-(x+y)^1 = -x-y$, good.\\n\\nn=2: $P(x,y)=x^2 - x y - 2 y^2$, $P(y,x)=y^2 - y x - 2 x^2 = -2x^2 - x y + y^2$\\n\\nSum: $(x^2 - xy -2y^2) + (-2x^2 -xy + y^2) = -x^2 -2xy -y^2 = -(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) = -(x+y)^2$, good.\\n\\nn=3: $P(x,y)=x^3 -3x y^2 -2 y^3$, $P(y,x)=y^3 -3y x^2 -2 x^3 = -2x^3 -3x^2 y + y^3$\\n\\nSum: $(x^3 -3x y^2 -2y^3) + (-2x^3 -3x^2 y + y^3) = -x^3 -3x^2 y -3x y^2 -y^3 = -(x^3 + 3x^2 y + 3x y^2 + y^3) = -(x+y)^3$, good.\\n\\nNow, for general $n$, we have $P(x,y) + P(y,x) = -(x+y)^n$\\n\\nAnd $P(1,0)=1$\\n\\nNow, is this sufficient? Not quite, because we have the full three-variable equation, but perhaps it is implied or we need both.\\n\\nBut in the cases above, it worked.\\n\\nNow, can we find all such $P$?\\n\\nLet $Q(x,y) = P(x,y)$, homogeneous degree $n$, $Q(1,0)=1$, and $Q(x,y) + Q(y,x) = -(x+y)^n$\\n\\nBut this is one equation, and $P$ has $n+1$ coefficients, so many solutions, but we also have the original functional equation which might impose more.\\n\\nIn the original, we have three terms, but with this symmetry, perhaps it's sufficient.\\n\\nAssume that $P(x,y)$ satisfies $P(x,y) + P(y,x) = -(x+y)^n$ and is homogeneous, and $P(1,0)=1$, and see if the original equation holds.\\n\\nBut for n=1,2,3 it did, but let's check if this alone implies the three-variable equation.\\n\\nThe three-variable equation is stronger.\\n\\nFor example, suppose n=2, and we have $P(x,y) + P(y,x) = -(x+y)^2$\\n\\nBut without the specific form, there might be other solutions.\\n\\nFor instance, let $P(x,y) = x^2 + a x y + b y^2$, then $P(y,x) = y^2 + a y x + b x^2 = b x^2 + a x y + y^2$\\n\\nSum: $(1+b)x^2 + 2a x y + (1+b)y^2 = -(x^2 + 2xy + y^2)$\\n\\nSo $1+b = -1$, $2a = -2$, so $b=-2$, $a=-1$, same as before. So unique for n=2.\\n\\nSimilarly for n=1: $P(x,y)=c x + d y$, $P(1,0)=c=1$, $P(x,y)+P(y,x)= (x + d y) + (y + d x) = (1+d)x + (1+d)y = -(x+y)$, so $1+d = -1$, $d=-2$, unique.\\n\\nFor n=3: $P(x,y)=x^3 + a x^2 y + b x y^2 + c y^3$\\n\\n$P(y,x)=y^3 + a y^2 x + b y x^2 + c x^3 = c x^3 + b x^2 y + a x y^2 + y^3$\\n\\nSum: $(1+c)x^3 + (a+b)x^2 y + (b+a)x y^2 + (1+c)y^3 = -(x^3 + 3x^2 y + 3x y^2 + y^3)$\\n\\nSo:\\n$1+c = -1$ ⇒ $c=-2$\\n$a+b = -3$\\nAnd $b+a = -3$, same.\\n\\nBut we have two equations for three unknowns? $a,b,c$, but $c=-2$, $a+b=-3$, so one free parameter.\\n\\nBut earlier from the three-variable equation, we had an additional constraint $b=0$ from the $xyz$ term.\\n\\nIndeed, in our calculation for n=3, we had $6b=0$ for the $xyz$ coefficient, forcing $b=0$, then $a=-3$.\\n\\nBut if we only use the pairwise condition, we have $P(x,y) = x^3 + a x^2 y + b x y^2 -2 y^3$ with $a+b=-3$.\\n\\nBut for the full equation to hold, we need more.\\n\\nIn particular, in the sum $P(x+y,z) + P(y+z,x) + P(z+x,y)$, we had a term $6b  x y z$, which must be zero, so $b=0$, then $a=-3$.\\n\\nSimilarly, for higher n, there will be more constraints.\\n\\nNow for n=4.\\n\\nLet $P(x,y) = x^4 + a x^3 y + b x^2 y^2 + c x y^3 + d y^4$\\n\\nFirst, $P(1,0)=1$, good.\\n\\nNow, the pairwise condition: $P(x,y) + P(y,x) = -(x+y)^4$\\n\\n$P(y,x) = y^4 + a y^3 x + b y^2 x^2 + c y x^3 + d x^4 = d x^4 + c x^3 y + b x^2 y^2 + a x y^3 + y^4$\\n\\nSum: $(1+d)x^4 + (a+c)x^3 y + (b+b)x^2 y^2 + (c+a)x y^3 + (1+d)y^4 = -(x^4 + 4x^3 y + 6x^2 y^2 + 4x y^3 + y^4)$\\n\\nSo:\\n$1+d = -1$ ⇒ $d=-2$\\n$a+c = -4$\\n$2b = -6$ ⇒ $b=-3$\\n$c+a = -4$, same as above.\\n\\nSo $d=-2$, $b=-3$, $a+c=-4$.\\n\\nNow, we need the three-variable sum to be zero.\\n\\nCompute $S = P(x+y,z) + P(y+z,x) + P(z+x,y)$\\n\\nThis is tedious, but let's find the coefficient of $x^2 y z$, for example.\\n\\nSince it must be symmetric, and homogeneous degree 4.\\n\\nNote that in $P(x+y,z)$, expand:\\n\\n$P(x+y,z) = (x+y)^4 + a (x+y)^3 z + b (x+y)^2 z^2 + c (x+y) z^3 + d z^4$\\n\\nThe terms that can contribute to mixed terms like $x^2 y z$ are from $a (x+y)^3 z$ and $b (x+y)^2 z^2$, etc.\\n\\nSpecifically, for $x^2 y z$: this is degree 4, with powers 2,1,1.\\n\\nIn $P(x+y,z)$: look for terms with $x^2 y z$.\\n\\nFrom $a (x+y)^3 z$: $(x+y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 y + 3x y^2 + y^3$, times $z$, so $a(3x^2 y z + \\\\cdots)$, so coefficient $3a$ for $x^2 y z$\\n\\nFrom other terms: $b (x+y)^2 z^2 = b(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) z^2$, no $z$, so no $x^2 y z$\\nHigher powers of z have higher degree in z, so no.\\nConstant in x,y has no x^2 y.\\nSo only from $a (x+y)^3 z$, coefficient $3a$ for $x^2 y z$\\n\\nSimilarly, in $P(y+z,x)$: this is $P(y+z,x)$, so arguments are $u=y+z$, $v=x$\\n\\n$P(u,v) = u^4 + a u^3 v + b u^2 v^2 + c u v^3 + d v^4$\\n\\nSo $P(y+z,x) = (y+z)^4 + a (y+z)^3 x + b (y+z)^2 x^2 + c (y+z) x^3 + d x^4$\\n\\nNow, term $x^2 y z$: from $b (y+z)^2 x^2 = b(y^2 + 2yz + z^2) x^2 = b x^2 y^2 + 2b x^2 y z + b x^2 z^2$, so coefficient $2b$ for $x^2 y z$\\n\\nFrom other terms? $a (y+z)^3 x = a(y^3 + 3y^2 z + 3y z^2 + z^3) x$, has $x y z^2$, not $x^2 y z$\\nHigher terms have higher powers of x, so no.\\nSo only $2b$ from this.\\n\\nIn $P(z+x,y)$: $u=z+x$, $v=y$\\n\\n$P(z+x,y) = (z+x)^4 + a (z+x)^3 y + b (z+x)^2 y^2 + c (z+x) y^3 + d y^4$\\n\\nTerm $x^2 y z$: from $a (z+x)^3 y = a(z^3 + 3z^2 x + 3z x^2 + x^3) y = a y z^3 + 3a x y z^2 + 3a x^2 y z + a x^3 y$, so coefficient $3a$ for $x^2 y z$\\n\\nFrom $b (z+x)^2 y^2 = b(z^2 + 2z x + x^2) y^2$, has $x^2 y^2$, not $x^2 y z$\\nSo only $3a$\\n\\nNow, total coefficient for $x^2 y z$ in sum S:\\n\\nFrom $P(x+y,z)$: $3a$\\nFrom $P(y+z,x)$: $2b$\\nFrom $P(z+x,y)$: $3a$\\nTotal: $3a + 2b + 3a = 6a + 2b$\\n\\nSet to 0: $6a + 2b = 0$\\n\\nWe have $b = -3$, so $6a + 2(-3) = 6a - 6 = 0$ ⇒ $6a=6$ ⇒ $a=1$\\n\\nThen from $a+c=-4$, $1+c=-4$ ⇒ $c=-5$\\n\\nSo $P(x,y) = x^4 + 1 x^3 y -3 x^2 y^2 -5 x y^3 -2 y^4$\\n\\nNow, we need to check if this satisfies the original equation, or if there are other terms.\\n\\nThere might be other monomials, like $x y z^2$, but by symmetry, since the expression is symmetric under cycling $x\\\\to y\\\\to z\\\\to x$, and $x^2 y z$ is not symmetric, but we can check $x y^2 z$ or others.\\n\\nNote that $x y^2 z$ should have the same coefficient by symmetry? Let's compute coefficient of $x y^2 z$.\\n\\nIn $P(x+y,z)$: from $a (x+y)^3 z$: $(x+y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 y + 3x y^2 + y^3$, times $z$, so $a(3x y^2 z + \\\\cdots)$, coefficient $3a$\\n\\nIn $P(y+z,x)$: $a (y+z)^3 x = a(y^3 + 3y^2 z + 3y z^2 + z^3) x$, so $a(3x y^2 z + \\\\cdots)$, coefficient $3a$\\n\\nIn $P(z+x,y)$: $b (z+x)^2 y^2 = b(z^2 + 2z x + x^2) y^2 = b y^2 z^2 + 2b x y^2 z + b x^2 y^2$, so $2b$ for $x y^2 z$\\n\\nTotal: $3a + 3a + 2b = 6a + 2b$, same as before, so also $6a+2b=0$, satisfied since $a=1,b=-3$.\\n\\nNow, check $x y z^2$.\\n\\nIn $P(x+y,z)$: $b (x+y)^2 z^2 = b(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) z^2$, so $b(2x y z^2 + \\\\cdots)$, coefficient $2b$\\n\\nIn $P(y+z,x)$: $c (y+z) x^3 = c(y+z) x^3$, no $z^2$\\n$c (y+z) x^3 = c x^3 y + c x^3 z$, not $x y z^2$\\nFrom $a (y+z)^3 x$: $a(3y z^2 + \\\\cdots) x = 3a x y z^2$, coefficient $3a$\\n\\nIn $P(z+x,y)$: $c (z+x) y^3 = c(z+x) y^3 = c y^3 z + c x y^3$, no $z^2$\\nFrom $a (z+x)^3 y$: $a(3z^2 x + \\\\cdots) y = 3a x y z^2$, coefficient $3a$\\n\\nTotal: $2b + 3a + 3a = 2b + 6a$, same as before, $6a+2b=0$, good.\\n\\nNow, are there other terms? Like $x^3 y$, but that would be degree 4, but in the sum, it might not be symmetric.\\n\\nFor example, $x^3 y$: in $P(x+y,z)$: from $(x+y)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3 y + \\\\cdots$, so $4x^3 y$\\nFrom $a (x+y)^3 z$: has $z$, so if no z, but here we have $x^3 y$, which may come from terms without z, but in $P(x+y,z)$, if no z, but $z$ is a variable, so unless coefficient independent of z, but here it's polynomial.\\nIn $P(x+y,z)$, the term $x^3 y$ can only come from $(x+y)^4$ if we consider it as part of the expansion, but $(x+y)^4$ has $4x^3 y$, and this is multiplied by nothing, so it's $4x^3 y$ in $P(x+y,z)$, but this term does not depend on $z$, so when we evaluate, it's there.\\nBut in the sum $S$, we have such terms.\\n\\nSpecifically, coefficient of $x^3 y$ in $S$.\\n\\nIn $P(x+y,z)$: from $(x+y)^4$: $4x^3 y$\\nOther terms have $z$, so if we are looking at the coefficient in the polynomial, $x^3 y$ is a monomial, and in $P(x+y,z)$, it appears in $(x+y)^4$ as $4x^3 y$, and since no other terms have $x^3 y$ without $z$, so coefficient is 4 for $x^3 y$.\\n\\nBut $x^3 y$ is not symmetric, and in other terms, it might appear.\\n\\nIn $P(y+z,x)$: this has variables $y,z,x$, so $x^3 y$ term: from $d x^4$? $d x^4$, no $y$\\n$c (y+z) x^3 = c x^3 y + c x^3 z$, so $c x^3 y$\\n$b (y+z)^2 x^2$, has $x^2$, not $x^3$\\nSo coefficient $c$ for $x^3 y$\\n\\nIn $P(z+x,y)$: $a (z+x)^3 y = a(z^3 + 3z^2 x + 3z x^2 + x^3) y = a x^3 y + \\\\cdots$, so $a x^3 y$\\n\\nTotal coefficient for $x^3 y$: from first: 4, from second: c, from third: a, total $4 + a + c$\\n\\nSet to 0: $4 + a + c = 0$\\n\\nBut we have $a + c = -4$, so $4 + (-4) = 0$, good.\\n\\nSimilarly, for $x^4$: in $P(x+y,z)$: from $(x+y)^4$: $x^4$\\nIn $P(y+z,x)$: $d x^4$\\nIn $P(z+x,y)$: from $(z+x)^4$: $x^4$\\nTotal: $1 + d + 1 = 2 + d$\\nSet to 0: $2 + d = 0$, and $d = -2$, so $2 - 2 = 0$, good.\\n\\nSimilarly, for $x^2 y^2$: let's compute.\\n\\nIn $P(x+y,z)$: from $(x+y)^4$: $6x^2 y^2$\\nFrom $b (x+y)^2 z^2$: $b x^2 z^2$, not $x^2 y^2$\\nSo only $6x^2 y^2$ if no z, but $6x^2 y^2$ is present.\\n\\nIn $P(y+z,x)$: from $b (y+z)^2 x^2$: $b y^2 x^2 = b x^2 y^2$\\nFrom other? $(y+z)^4$ has $6y^2 z^2$, not $x^2 y^2$\\nSo $b x^2 y^2$\\n\\nIn $P(z+x,y)$: from $b (z+x)^2 y^2$: $b x^2 y^2$\\nTotal: $6 + b + b = 6 + 2b$\\nSet to 0: $6 + 2(-3) = 6-6=0$, good.\\n\\nNow, for $x y z^2$, we already did, satisfied.\\n\\nAnd for $x^2 y z$, satisfied.\\n\\nNow, is there a constant term? No.\\n\\nSo for n=4, with $a=1, b=-3, c=-5, d=-2$, it works.\\n\\nBut earlier we had $a+c=-4$, $1+(-5)=-4$, good.\\n\\nNow, pattern: for n=1: $P=x-2y$\\n\\nn=2: $x^2 - x y -2 y^2$\\n\\nn=3: $x^3 -3x y^2 -2 y^3$\\n\\nn=4: $x^4 + x^3 y -3 x^2 y^2 -5 x y^3 -2 y^4$\\n\\nNotice that in all cases, the coefficient of $y^n$ is -2.\\n\\nAnd $P(x,0)=x^n$.\\n\\nThe functional equation might be satisfied for all n with appropriate choice.\\n\\nBut the problem asks to determine the polynomials, implying perhaps all such, or a specific one, but with $P(1,0)=1$, and the conditions.\\n\\nBut for each n, there might be a solution.\\n\\nIn n=3, we had a unique solution, similarly for others.\\n\\nFor n=4, we got a specific one.\\n\\nBut is it always possible? And what is the general form?\\n\\nNotice that in the three-variable equation, when we set $a=b=c=0$, it holds trivially.\\n\\nOr set $a=1,b=0,c=0$: then $P(1+0,0) + P(0+0,1) + P(0+1,0) = P(1,0) + P(0,1) + P(1,0) = 1 + P(0,1) + 1$\\n\\nSet to 0: $2 + P(0,1) = 0$, so $P(0,1) = -2$\\n\\nSince $P$ is homogeneous, $P(0,y) = k y^n$, and $P(0,1) = k = -2$, so $P(0,y) = -2 y^n$\\n\\nSimilarly, from earlier, the constant term in $x$ is $-2 y^n$ when $x=0$.\\n\\nIn our expressions, yes, coefficient of $y^n$ is -2.\\n\\nNow, back to the problem, it says \\\"determine the polynomials\\\", plural, so likely for each n, there is one.\\n\\nBut condition c is $P(1,0)=1$, which is satisfied.\\n\\nPerhaps the polynomial is unique for each n.\\n\\nFrom the pairwise condition and the homogeneity, and the additional constraints from the three-variable equation, it might be unique.\\n\\nNotice that in the sum $S=0$, and by symmetry, the only freedom is fixed by the coefficients.\\n\\nBut the problem might expect a specific answer, or the general form.\\n\\nLooking back, in all cases, $P(x,y) = x^n - 2 y^n + \\\\text{other terms}$\\n\\nBut the other terms are determined.\\n\\nObserve that for n=1: $x - 2y$\\n\\nn=2: $x^2 - x y - 2 y^2 = (x^2 - 2y^2) - x y$\\n\\nn=3: $x^3 - 3x y^2 - 2 y^3$\\n\\nn=4: $x^4 + x^3 y - 3 x^2 y^2 - 5 x y^3 - 2 y^4$\\n\\nNot obvious.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps $P(x,y) = (x - 2y) (x + y)^{n-1}$ or something.\\n\\nFor n=1: $x-2y$, good.\\n\\nn=2: $(x-2y)(x+y) = x^2 + x y -2x y -2 y^2 = x^2 - x y -2 y^2$, matches!\\n\\nn=3: $(x-2y)(x+y)^2 = (x-2y)(x^2 + 2x y + y^2) = x(x^2 + 2x y + y^2) -2y(x^2 + 2x y + y^2) = x^3 + 2x^2 y + x y^2 -2x^2 y -4x y^2 -2 y^3 = x^3 + (2-2)x^2 y + (1-4)x y^2 -2 y^3 = x^3 -3x y^2 -2 y^3$, matches!\\n\\nn=4: $(x-2y)(x+y)^3 = (x-2y)(x^3 + 3x^2 y + 3x y^2 + y^3) = x(x^3 + 3x^2 y + 3x y^2 + y^3) -2y(x^3 + 3x^2 y + 3x y^2 + y^3) = x^4 + 3x^3 y + 3x^2 y^2 + x y^3 -2x^3 y -6x^2 y^2 -6x y^3 -2 y^4 = x^4 + (3-2)x^3 y + (3-6)x^2 y^2 + (1-6)x y^3 -2 y^4 = x^4 + x^3 y -3x^2 y^2 -5x y^3 -2 y^4$, exactly matches!\\n\\nPerfect!\\n\\nSo $P(x,y) = (x - 2y) (x + y)^{n-1}$\\n\\nNow, check the conditions.\\n\\na.) Homogeneous: $x-2y$ degree 1, $(x+y)^{n-1}$ degree $n-1$, so total degree $n$, and $P(tx,ty) = (tx - 2 ty) (tx + ty)^{n-1} = t(x-2y) t^{n-1} (x+y)^{n-1} = t^n (x-2y)(x+y)^{n-1} = t^n P(x,y)$, good.\\n\\nb.) Need to check $P(a+b,c) + P(b+c,a) + P(c+a,b) = 0$\\n\\nWith $P(u,v) = (u - 2v) (u + v)^{n-1}$\\n\\nSo $P(a+b,c) = (a+b - 2c) (a+b + c)^{n-1}$\\n\\n$P(b+c,a) = (b+c - 2a) (b+c + a)^{n-1} = (b+c-2a)(a+b+c)^{n-1}$\\n\\n$P(c+a,b) = (c+a - 2b) (c+a + b)^{n-1} = (c+a-2b)(a+b+c)^{n-1}$\\n\\nNote that $a+b+c$ is common in the second part, so factor $(a+b+c)^{n-1}$:\\n\\nSum = $(a+b+c)^{n-1} [ (a+b-2c) + (b+c-2a) + (c+a-2b) ]$\\n\\nCompute the expression in brackets:\\n\\n$a + b - 2c + b + c - 2a + c + a - 2b = (a -2a + a) + (b + b - 2b) + (-2c + c + c) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$\\n\\nSo sum is $(a+b+c)^{n-1} \\\\times 0 = 0$, perfect for all $n$.\\n\\nc.) $P(1,0) = (1 - 0) (1 + 0)^{n-1} = 1 \\\\times 1 = 1$, good.\\n\\nSo for each positive integer $n$, $P(x,y) = (x - 2y)(x + y)^{n-1}$ satisfies all conditions.\\n\\nAnd since for each $n$ it works, and likely these are the only ones, as we saw uniqueness in low degrees.\\n\\nSo the polynomials are $P(x,y) = (x - 2y)(x + y)^{n-1}$ for positive integers $n$.\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"determine the polynomials\\\", so probably describe this family.\\n\\nIn the answer, perhaps write the general form.\\n\\nSince it's a functional equation, and we found a family, likely that's it.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 2 is $P(x,y) = (x - 2y)(x + y)^{n-1}$ for some positive integer $n$.\\n\\nBut to box it.\\n\\nNow, back to Problem 1, we have $d=0$.\\n\\nSo final answers.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"P(x,y) = (x - 2y)(x + y)^{n-1} for some positive integer n\"\n}",
