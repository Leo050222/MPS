Since n divides 2^n + 2, we can try small values and look for patterns or known results.\\n\\nKnown fact: Numbers n such that n divides 2^n + 2 are called \\\"Lehmer numbers\\\" or related to special pseudoprimes. Known examples include n = 1, 2, 6, 66, 946, ... but we need n < 100.\\n\\nLet’s test small n:\\n\\nn = 1: 2^1 + 2 = 4, 1 divides 4 → yes\\nn = 2: 2^2 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6, 2 divides 6 → yes\\nn = 3: 8 + 2 = 10, 3 does not divide 10 → no\\nn = 4: 16 + 2 = 18, 4 does not divide 18 → no\\nn = 5: 32 + 2 = 34, 5 doesn't divide 34 → no\\nn = 6: 2^6 = 64, 64 + 2 = 66, 66 / 6 = 11 → yes\\n\\nNow check larger even n? Try n = 66:\\n2^66 is huge, but we can compute 2^66 mod 66.\\n\\nUse Chinese Remainder Theorem: compute mod 6 and mod 11?

11×180=1980, 1980+11=1991 → yes\\n181 is prime? Check: √181≈13.4, check primes up to 13: 2,3,5,7,11,13\\n181 odd, 1+8+1=10 not div by 3, ends not 5, 7×25=175, 181-175=6 not div, 11×16=176, 181-176=5, 13×13=169, 181-169=12 → not div → 181 prime\\nSo 3982 = 2 × 11 × 181\\nSo positive divisors of 3982 are:\\n1, 2, 11, 22, 181, 362, 1991, 3982\\nSo d ∈ {1,2,11,22,181,362,1991,3982}\\nNow s = d - 1 ≥ 1 ⇒ d ≥ 2\\nSo d ≥ 2 → exclude d=1\\nNow compute for each d:\\nh = (3982 + d - d^2)/(2d)\\nAnd must be positive integer.\\nTry d=2:\\nh = (3982 + 2 - 4)/(4) = (3980)/4 = 995 → integer\\ns = d - 1 = 1\\nh = 995 > 0 → valid\\nPair (h,s) = (995,1)\\nBut h and s positive integers, yes.\\nNow check if conditions satisfied: h=995 horizontal lines (all parallel), s=1 slanted line (not horizontal, no two parallel — only one, so ok), no three concurrent — only two lines max intersect, so no three concurrent → ok\\nNow compute regions to verify:\\nL = 995 + 1 = 996\\nI = intersections: between h and s: 995 × 1 = 995 (each horizontal crosses the slanted)\\nAmong s: C(1,2)=0\\nTotal I = 995\\nR = 1 + L + I = 1 + 996 + 995 = 1992 → yes\\nGood.\\nd=11:\\ns = 10\\nh = (3982 + 11 - 121)/(2×11) = (3982 - 110)/22 = 3872 / 22\\n3872 ÷ 22: 22×176 = 22×170=3740, 22×6=132, total 3740+132=3872 → 176\\nh=176 >0 → valid\\nPair (176,10)\\nd=22:\\ns=21\\nh=(3982 +22 - 484)/(44) = (3982 - 462)/44 = 3520 / 44\\n3520 ÷ 44: 44×80=3520 → h=80\\nValid → (80,21)\\nd=181:\\ns=180\\nh=(3982 +181 - 181^2)/(2×181)\\nFirst, 181^2 = 32761\\n3982 + 181 = 4163\\n4163 - 32761 = -28598\\nDenominator 362\\nh = -28598 / 362 < 0 → invalid\\nSimilarly, larger d will give more negative numerator → h negative\\nSo only d=2,11,22\\nThus pairs: (995,1), (176,10), (80,21)\\nBut the problem asks for all pairs (h,s) of positive integers.\\nAre there any others?\\nEarlier we assumed d|3982, but is that necessary?\\nRecall: h = [3982 + d - d^2]/(2d)\\nFor h to be integer, 2d must divide (3982 + d - d^2)\\nNow, 3982 + d - d^2 ≡ 0 mod 2d\\nThis means:\\n(1) mod d: 3982 + d - d^2 ≡ 3982 ≡ 0 mod d ⇒ d|3982\\n(2) mod 2: we also need the expression divisible by 2, but since we have 2d, and d may be odd, we need the whole thing even.\\nBut from (1), d must divide 3982, so our list is complete.\\nAnd for d=2,11,22, we got integer h, and for others h negative.\\nd=362: s=361, h=(3982 +362 - 362^2)/(724)\\n362^2=131044, 3982+362=4344, 4344-131044= -126700, divided by 724 → negative → invalid\\nSimilarly others.\\nSo only three pairs.\\nBut in the expression h = 1991/(s+1) - s/2, for h to be integer, since s/2 may be half-integer, but 1991/(s+1) must compensate.\\nBut our derivation via d|3982 covers all cases because d=s+1 must divide 3982 for h to be rational, actually integer.\\nSo pairs: (h,s) = (995,1), (176,10), (80,21)\\nNow, the problem says \\\"determine all pairs\\\", so we list them.\\nBut in what order? Probably as pairs.\\nNow back to Problem 1: e = 1992\\nProblem 2: the pairs are (995,1), (176,10), (80,21)\\nBut need to present answer_2 appropriately.\\nProbably as a list of pairs.\\nIn JSON, we can write as string or array.\\nBut instruction: put only the answer value in quotes, no explanations.\\nSo perhaps write as text: \\\"(995,1), (176,10), (80,21)\\\"\\nOr maybe sorted.\\nBut since the problem doesn't specify order, we can list them.\\nNote: in the region count, is there any restriction that the slanted lines must not be vertical? The problem says \\\"not horizontal\\\", but could be vertical? But if vertical, and multiple, they would be parallel, but the condition says no two of the s lines are parallel, so at most one vertical. But in our calculation, we didn't assume anything about slope, just that they are not horizontal and no two parallel, so it's fine. Vertical is allowed as long as only one, but in our solutions, s=1,10,21, so for s>1, no verticals anyway since no two parallel. For s=1, it could be vertical, but still satisfies.\\nAlso, no three concurrent: we assumed that's achievable, which it is by general position.\\nSo all good.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1992\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(995,1), (176,10), (80,21)\"\n}",
