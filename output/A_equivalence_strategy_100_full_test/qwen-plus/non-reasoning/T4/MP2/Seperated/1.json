We are not solving for all such pairs, but rather deducing the value of T.\\n\\nStep 1: Use the divisibility conditions.\\n\\nSince P | Q² + 1, there exists a polynomial A(x) such that:\\n\\nQ² + 1 = P · A\\n\\nSimilarly, since Q | P² + 1, there exists B(x) such that:\\n\\nP² + 1 = Q · B\\n\\nNow consider the expression P² + Q² + 1.\\n\\nFrom above:\\nP² + Q² + 1 = (P² + 1) + Q² = Q·B + Q² = Q(B + Q)\\n\\nAlso:\\nP² + Q² + 1 = P² + (Q² + 1) = P² + P·A = P(P + A)\\n\\nSo this expression is divisible by both P and Q. But we are told it equals P Q T for some constant T — so T must be a constant (not a polynomial).\\n\\nTherefore, P² + Q² + 1 is divisible by P Q, and the quotient is a constant T. So:\\n\\nT = (P² + Q² + 1)/(P Q)\\n\\nThis rational function is actually a constant. Our goal is to determine possible values of T.\\n\\nLet’s suppose deg(P) = m, deg(Q) = n.\\n\\nSince P and Q are monic, leading terms are x^m and x^n.\\n\\nThen:\\n- deg(Q² + 1) = 2n (since n ≥ 0)\\n- P divides Q² + 1 ⇒ deg(P) ≤ 2n ⇒ m ≤ 2n\\n\\nSimilarly, Q divides P² + 1 ⇒ n ≤ 2m\\n\\nSo: m ≤ 2n and n ≤ 2m → the degrees are comparable.\\n\\nNow look at the expression:\\n\\nT = (P² + Q² + 1)/(P Q) = P/(Q) + Q/(P) + 1/(P Q)\\n\\nBut T is a constant. So this rational function is constant.\\n\\nLet’s suppose that neither P nor Q is constant. Then P/Q is a non-constant rational function unless deg P = deg Q.\\n\\nAssume deg P = deg Q = d.\\n\\nThen leading term of P is x^d, same for Q.\\n\\nThen:\\n- P² has degree 2d, leading coefficient 1\\n- Q² has degree 2d, leading coefficient 1\\n- So P² + Q² has leading term 2x^{2d}\\n- PQ has degree 2d, leading coefficient 1\\n\\nSo (P² + Q² + 1)/(PQ) has leading term 2x^{2d}/x^{2d} = 2, and lower order terms. For this to be constant, all non-constant terms must cancel.\\n\\nBut unless there is symmetry, this may not happen. Perhaps try small degree examples.\\n\\nTry constant polynomials.\\n\\nCase 1: Suppose P is constant. Since it's monic, and constant, then P(x) = 1 (only monic constant polynomial is 1, as leading coefficient is the value itself).\\n\\nSimilarly, if Q is constant, Q = 1.\\n\\nTry P(x) = 1.\\nThen P divides Q² + 1 ⇒ 1 divides everything, OK.\\nQ divides P² + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 ⇒ Q divides 2.\\nSince Q is monic polynomial, and divides 2 (a constant), then Q must be a constant monic polynomial dividing 2 ⇒ Q = 1 or Q = 2? But monic constant polynomial must have leading coefficient 1 ⇒ only possibility is Q = 1 or possibly -1? But leading coefficient is 1 ⇒ Q = 1.\\n\\nCheck: Q divides 2 ⇒ 1 divides 2, yes.\\n\\nSo (P,Q) = (1,1) is a candidate.\\n\\nNow compute:\\nP² + Q² + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\\nPQ = 1*1 = 1\\nSo T = 3/1 = 3\\n\\nIs T constant? Yes.\\n\\nBut is this the only possibility?\\n\\nWait, could Q be other constants? Suppose Q = c, monic constant ⇒ c = 1.\\nSo only constant possibility is P=Q=1.\\n\\nBut maybe other constant solutions?\\nSuppose P(x) = 1, Q(x) = i? But i is not 1, so not monic? Wait: monic means leading coefficient 1. For constant polynomials, the \\\"leading\\\" coefficient is the constant itself. So only monic constant polynomial is 1. So P and Q must be 1 if constant.\\n\\nSo only constant solution is P=Q=1, giving T=3.\\n\\nBut maybe non-constant?\\n\\nTry linear polynomials.\\n\\nAssume P(x) = x + a, Q(x) = x + b, both monic.\\n\\nCondition 1: P divides Q² + 1\\nSo (x+a) divides (x+b)^2 + 1 = x² + 2b x + b² + 1\\nSo x = -a must be a root:\\n(-a + b)^2 + 1 = 0 ⇒ (b - a)^2 = -1 ⇒ b - a = ±i\\n\\nSimilarly, Q divides P² + 1 ⇒ (x + b) divides (x + a)^2 + 1\\nSo x = -b is a root: (-b + a)^2 + 1 = 0 ⇒ (a - b)^2 = -1 ⇒ same as above.\\n\\nSo condition is (a - b)^2 = -1 ⇒ a - b = ±i\\n\\nSo let’s set b = a + i (without loss, up to swap)\\n\\nThen P(x) = x + a, Q(x) = x + a + i\\n\\nNow compute P² + Q² + 1 and see if (P² + Q² + 1)/(P Q) is constant.\\n\\nCompute:\\nP² = (x+a)^2 = x² + 2a x + a²\\nQ² = (x+a+i)^2 = x² + 2(a+i)x + (a+i)^2 = x² + 2a x + 2i x + a² + 2a i -1\\nSo Q² = x² + 2a x + 2i x + a² + 2a i -1\\n\\nP² + Q² = 2x² + 4a x + 2i x + 2a² + 2a i -1\\nThen P² + Q² + 1 = 2x² + (4a + 2i)x + 2a² + 2a i\\n\\nNow PQ = (x+a)(x+a+i) = (x+a)^2 + i(x+a) = x² + 2a x + a² + i x + i a = x² + (2a + i)x + a² + i a\\n\\nNow compute (P² + Q² + 1)/(PQ) = [2x² + (4a + 2i)x + 2a² + 2a i] / [x² + (2a + i)x + a² + i a]\\n\\nNotice numerator = 2 * denominator\\nBecause 2*(x² + (2a + i)x + a² + i a) = 2x² + (4a + 2i)x + 2a² + 2i a\\nWhich matches exactly the numerator.\\n\\nSo ratio = 2\\n\\nThus T = 2\\n\\nBut earlier with constants we had T=3\\n\\nContradiction? Or multiple possibilities?\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"find T\\\", implying it might be unique? Or perhaps T is always the same?\\n\\nWait — in this case T=2, previously T=3. But both satisfy the divisibility?\\n\\nCheck: P(x)=x+a, Q(x)=x+a+i\\n\\nWe already ensured that P divides Q²+1 and Q divides P²+1 by construction (roots at -a and -b respectively).\\n\\nAnd both are monic.\\n\\nSo this is a valid pair.\\n\\nBut now T=2, whereas for P=Q=1, T=3\\n\\nSo different T?\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"find T\\\", singular.\\n\\nPerhaps I misunderstood. The equation P² + Q² + 1 = P Q T is supposed to be derived from the divisibility conditions, and T is a constant that works for all such pairs? That can't be, since we have T=3 and T=2.\\n\\nUnless the problem assumes that such a T exists universally, but clearly it doesn't.\\n\\nRe-read problem:\\n\\n\\\"find T, where T is the constant satisfying P² + Q² + 1 = P Q T derived from the divisibility conditions.\\\"\\n\\nThe wording is ambiguous. Is T depending on the pair, or is it the same for all?\\n\\nBut it says \\\"the constant\\\", suggesting it's unique.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps in all cases, T is constant per pair, but we are to find what values T can take? But it says \\\"find T\\\", not \\\"find all possible T\\\".\\n\\nWait — perhaps I made a mistake.\\n\\nIn the linear case, we have P² + Q² + 1 = 2 P Q\\nSo T=2\\n\\nIn constant case P=Q=1: 1+1+1=3, PQ=1, so 3 = 1*T ⇒ T=3\\n\\nBut does P=Q=1 satisfy the divisibility?\\nP divides Q²+1: Q²+1 = 1+1=2, P=1 divides 2? Yes, since 2/1=2 polynomial.\\nQ divides P²+1: same, 1+1=2, Q=1 divides 2. Yes.\\n\\nSo both are valid.\\n\\nBut then T is not unique.\\n\\nBut the problem asks to \\\"find T\\\", implying a single answer.\\n\\nUnless... is P=Q=1 really allowed? Monic constant polynomial: yes, conventionally, the leading coefficient of a nonzero constant polynomial is itself, so to be monic, it must be 1. So yes.\\n\\nBut perhaps the problem implies non-constant? It doesn't say.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation P² + Q² + 1 = P Q T is meant to be an identity that follows necessarily from the divisibility, and T is determined uniquely by the structure.\\n\\nBut we have counterexample.\\n\\nWait — in the linear case, T=2; in constant case, T=3.\\n\\nBut maybe there's a constraint I missed.\\n\\nAnother thought: perhaps for each pair, such a T exists, but the problem wants us to find what T must be, assuming such a relation holds. But it does hold in both cases, with different T.\\n\\nUnless the problem is implying that T is independent of x, which it is in both cases, but takes different values.\\n\\nPerhaps I need to consider that P and Q satisfy a functional equation.\\n\\nFrom the divisibility:\\nQ² + 1 ≡ 0 mod P ⇒ Q² ≡ -1 mod P\\nP² + 1 ≡ 0 mod Q ⇒ P² ≡ -1 mod Q\\n\\nNow consider the resultant or common roots.\\n\\nSuppose r is a root of P. Then P(r)=0.\\nFrom P divides Q²+1, we get Q(r)² + 1 = 0 ⇒ Q(r) = ±i\\nSimilarly, if s is a root of Q, then P(s)² + 1 = 0 ⇒ P(s) = ±i\\n\\nNow go back to the expression:\\n\\nS = P² + Q² + 1\\n\\nWe suspect S is divisible by P Q, so S / (P Q) is a polynomial. But in our examples, it's constant.\\n\\nIs it always constant?\\n\\nIn the constant case P=Q=1, S=3, PQ=1, so S/PQ=3, constant.\\nIn linear case, we got 2, constant.\\n\\nTry quadratic.\\n\\nSuppose P and Q are both quadratic.\\n\\nAssume symmetry: suppose P and Q are related.\\n\\nFrom the modulo conditions, at each root of P, Q takes value ±i.\\n\\nSuppose P has roots r1, r2. Then Q(r1)=±i, Q(r2)=±i.\\nSimilarly, if Q has roots s1,s2, then P(s1)=±i, P(s2)=±i.\\n\\nNow, suppose we assume that P and Q satisfy P² + Q² + 1 = T P Q for some constant T.\\n\\nThen this can be rewritten as:\\n\\nP² - T P Q + Q² = -1\\n\\nOr:\\n\\nP² - T P Q + Q² + 1 = 0\\n\\nThis resembles a quadratic equation.\\n\\nTreat as quadratic in P:\\n\\nP² - T Q P + (Q² + 1) = 0\\n\\nFor this to hold, P must be a root of X² - T Q X + (Q² + 1) = 0\\n\\nBut we also know that Q divides P² + 1, and P divides Q² + 1.\\n\\nSuppose that for a fixed Q, P satisfies this quadratic.\\n\\nThe discriminant is T² Q² - 4(Q² + 1) = (T² - 4) Q² - 4\\n\\nFor P to be a polynomial, this discriminant must be a perfect square.\\n\\nBut perhaps instead, notice that in both examples we tried, T is an integer: 3 and 2.\\n\\nTry another example.\\n\\nSuppose P(x) = x, monic.\\nThen P divides Q² + 1 ⇒ Q(0)² + 1 = 0 ⇒ Q(0) = ±i\\nSimilarly, Q divides P² + 1 = x² + 1\\nSo Q divides x² + 1.\\n\\nSince Q is monic polynomial dividing x²+1, possibilities: 1, x-i, x+i, x²+1\\n\\nBut Q(0) = ±i\\n- If Q=1, Q(0)=1 ≠ ±i\\n- If Q=x-i, Q(0)=-i, which is ±i? Yes, -i is one of them.\\n- If Q=x+i, Q(0)=i, good.\\n- If Q=x²+1, Q(0)=1 ≠ ±i\\n\\nSo possible Q: x-i or x+i\\n\\nTry Q(x) = x - i\\nCheck if Q divides P² + 1: P² + 1 = x² + 1\\nDoes x - i divide x² + 1? Roots: x=i, -i. x - i has root i, and i² + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0, yes.\\nSimilarly, P divides Q² + 1: Q² + 1 = (x-i)^2 + 1 = x² - 2i x -1 + 1 = x² - 2i x\\nP(x)=x, so does x divide x² - 2i x? Yes, since no constant term.\\n\\nSo (P,Q) = (x, x - i) is a valid pair.\\n\\nNow compute P² + Q² + 1 = x² + (x - i)^2 + 1 = x² + (x² - 2i x -1) + 1 = 2x² - 2i x\\nPQ = x(x - i) = x² - i x\\n\\nNow (P² + Q² + 1)/(PQ) = (2x² - 2i x)/(x² - i x) = 2(x² - i x)/(x² - i x) = 2\\n\\nSo T=2\\n\\nSimilarly, if Q=x+i, same thing: Q²+1 = (x+i)^2 +1 = x² + 2i x -1 +1 = x² + 2i x\\nP=x divides it? Yes.\\nP²+1=x²+1, divided by Q=x+i: root -i, (-i)^2+1=-1+1=0, yes.\\nThen P²+Q²+1 = x² + (x² + 2i x) +1 = 2x² + 2i x +1? Wait no: Q²+1 is already computed, but P²+Q²+1 = x² + (x+i)^2 +1 = x² + x² + 2i x -1 +1 = 2x² + 2i x\\nPQ = x(x+i) = x² + i x\\nRatio = (2x² + 2i x)/(x² + i x) = 2(x² + i x)/(x² + i x) = 2\\n\\nAgain T=2\\n\\nNow earlier constant pair gave T=3, but let's double-check that.\\nP=1, Q=1\\nP divides Q²+1: Q²+1=1+1=2, 1 divides 2? In polynomial ring, yes, because 2/1=2 is a polynomial.\\nSimilarly, Q divides P²+1=2.\\nNow P² + Q² + 1 = 1+1+1=3\\nPQ=1*1=1\\nSo 3 = 1 * T ⇒ T=3\\n\\nBut is there a requirement that the division is in C[x], which it is.\\n\\nBut perhaps the problem intends for non-constant polynomials? Or perhaps P and Q are not both constant?\\n\\nWait, but in the constant case, do they satisfy \\\"divides\\\"? Yes.\\n\\nBut let's see the expression P² + Q² + 1 = T P Q\\nFor P=Q=1, 3 = T *1 ⇒ T=3\\n\\nBut in all non-constant examples, T=2\\n\\nPerhaps there is another constant pair?\\nSuppose P=1, can Q be something else?\\nQ must divide P²+1=2, and be monic constant ⇒ Q=1 only.\\nSimilarly, if P is constant, must be 1, then Q=1.\\n\\nSo only constant pair is (1,1)\\n\\nNow, is there a pair where T is different?\\n\\nTry P(x) = x^2 + 1, monic.\\nThen P divides Q² + 1 ⇒ Q² + 1 ≡ 0 mod (x^2+1)\\nSo for x=i, Q(i)^2 +1 =0 ⇒ Q(i)=±i\\nFor x=-i, Q(-i)^2 +1=0 ⇒ Q(-i)=±i\\n\\nAlso, Q divides P² + 1 = (x^2+1)^2 + 1 = x^4 + 2x^2 + 1 + 1 = x^4 + 2x^2 + 2\\n\\nSo Q is a monic divisor of x^4 + 2x^2 + 2\\n\\nFactor: let u=x^2, u^2 + 2u + 2 =0 ⇒ u = [-2±√(4-8)]/2 = [-2±√(-4)]/2 = -1±i\\nSo roots x = ±√(-1+i), etc., complicated.\\n\\nBut Q must satisfy Q(i)=±i, Q(-i)=±i\\n\\nSuppose we try Q(x) = x\\nThen Q(i)=i, Q(-i)=-i\\nWe need Q(i)=±i: i is ok, Q(-i)=-i which is ±i, ok.\\nNow check if Q divides P²+1: P²+1 = x^4 + 2x^2 + 2\\nQ(x)=x, so does x divide this? Constant term is 2≠0, so no.\\n\\nTry Q(x) = x^2\\nQ(i) = -1, need ±i, -1 ≠ ±i, no.\\n\\nTry Q(x) = x^2 - 1? Q(i) = -1 -1 = -2 ≠ ±i\\n\\nTry Q(x) = i? But not monic.\\n\\nTry Q(x) = x^2 + c\\nQ(i) = -1 + c, set equal to i or -i\\nSay -1 + c = i ⇒ c = 1+i\\nSimilarly Q(-i) = -1 + c = i, same.\\nSo set Q(x) = x^2 + 1 + i\\nBut is it monic? Leading coefficient 1, yes.\\nNow check if it divides P²+1 = x^4 + 2x^2 + 2\\nBut Q is degree 2, so check if it divides.\\nBut also, we need to verify the division.\\nMoreover, Q must divide P²+1, which is degree 4.\\nBut let's compute gcd or evaluate.\\nP²+1 at roots of Q: solve x^2 +1 +i =0 ⇒ x^2 = -1 -i\\nLet r be such that r^2 = -1 -i\\nThen P(r)^2 +1 = (r^2 +1)^2 +1 = (-1 -i +1)^2 +1 = (-i)^2 +1 = -1 +1 =0\\nOh! So yes, if r^2 = -1 -i, then P(r) = r^2 +1 = -1 -i +1 = -i, so P(r)^2 +1 = (-i)^2 +1 = -1+1=0\\nSimilarly for other root.\\nSo yes, Q divides P²+1.\\n\\nNow check if P divides Q²+1\\nQ²+1 = (x^2 +1 +i)^2 +1 = x^4 + 2x^2(1+i) + (1+i)^2 +1 = x^4 + 2(1+i)x^2 + (1 + 2i -1) +1 = x^4 + 2(1+i)x^2 + 2i +1\\nNow P(x)=x^2+1\\nWe need to see if x^2+1 divides this.\\nEvaluate at x=i: Q(i)^2 +1 = (i^2 +1 +i)^2 +1 = (-1 +1 +i)^2 +1 = i^2 +1 = -1+1=0\\nAt x=-i: Q(-i)^2 +1 = ((-i)^2 +1 +i)^2 +1 = (-1 +1 +i)^2 +1 = i^2 +1=0\\nSo yes, since P has simple roots and Q²+1 vanishes there, P divides Q²+1.\\n\\nSo (P,Q) = (x^2+1, x^2+1+i) is a valid pair.\\n\\nNow compute P² + Q² + 1 and PQ\\nP² = (x^2+1)^2 = x^4 + 2x^2 +1\\nQ² = (x^2+1+i)^2 = x^4 + 2x^2(1+i) + (1+i)^2 = x^4 + 2(1+i)x^2 + (1 + 2i -1) = x^4 + 2(1+i)x^2 + 2i\\nSo P² + Q² + 1 = [x^4 + 2x^2 +1] + [x^4 + 2(1+i)x^2 + 2i] + 1 = 2x^4 + [2 + 2 + 2i]x^2 + (1 + 2i + 1) = 2x^4 + (4 + 2i)x^2 + (2 + 2i)\\n\\nPQ = (x^2+1)(x^2+1+i) = x^2(x^2+1+i) +1*(x^2+1+i) = x^4 + x^2 + i x^2 + x^2 + 1 + i = x^4 + (2 + i)x^2 + (1 + i)\\n\\nNow compute (P² + Q² + 1)/(PQ) = [2x^4 + (4 + 2i)x^2 + (2 + 2i)] / [x^4 + (2 + i)x^2 + (1 + i)]\\n\\nFactor numerator: 2[ x^4 + (2 + i)x^2 + (1 + i) ]\\nExactly twice the denominator!\\nSo ratio = 2\\nThus T=2\\n\\nAgain T=2\\n\\nNow the only exception was the constant pair (1,1) giving T=3\\n\\nBut in that case, let's see: P=1, Q=1\\nP divides Q²+1: Q²+1=2, and 1 divides 2, yes.\\nBut is 1 considered to have leading coefficient 1? Yes.\\n\\nHowever, perhaps in the context, polynomials are non-constant? Or perhaps the problem implies that the divisibility leads to the equation with constant T, but in the constant case, PQ=1, and P²+Q²+1=3, so it's fine.\\n\\nBut why do all non-constant pairs give T=2?\\n\\nPerhaps for non-constant polynomials, T=2 always.\\n\\nBut the problem doesn't specify non-constant.\\n\\nMaybe the constant pair is trivial and excluded.\\n\\nAnother thought: in the constant pair, does Q divide P²+1? P²+1=1+1=2, Q=1, and 2/1=2, which is a polynomial, so yes.\\n\\nBut perhaps the issue is that in the derivation of P² + Q² + 1 = T P Q, it might require that P and Q are non-constant, but the problem doesn't say.\\n\\nPerhaps T is not always constant, but in all cases we've seen, it is constant: either 2 or 3.\\n\\nBut in the constant case, is the equation P² + Q² + 1 = T P Q with T constant meaningful? Yes.\\n\\nBut let's see if there are other constant pairs.\\nSuppose P(x) = c, but monic constant ⇒ c=1, similarly Q=1.\\nSo only one constant pair.\\n\\nNow, is there a pair where T is different from 2 and 3?\\n\\nSuppose P=Q.\\nThen P divides P²+1, and P divides Q²+1=P²+1.\\nSo P divides P²+1.\\nBut P divides P², so P divides (P²+1) - P² =1.\\nSo P divides 1, so P is a constant polynomial.\\nSince monic, P=1.\\nThen Q=1, so only when P=Q=1.\\nSo only in that case P=Q.\\n\\nOtherwise P ≠ Q.\\n\\nNow, in all non-constant cases, we got T=2.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem expects T=2, ignoring the constant case, or perhaps the constant case does not satisfy because in P² + Q² + 1 = T P Q, if P and Q are constant, it's fine, but maybe the divisibility is trivial.\\n\\nBut mathematically, it satisfies.\\n\\nUnless \\\"polynomials\\\" here imply non-constant, but usually not.\\n\\nAnother idea: in the constant case, does \\\"leading coefficient 1\\\" make sense? For constant polynomial, the degree is 0, and the leading coefficient is the constant itself, so to be 1, it must be 1. So it's valid.\\n\\nBut perhaps when we derive P² + Q² + 1 = T P Q from the divisibility, it assumes something.\\n\\nFrom the conditions:\\nQ² + 1 = P A for some polynomial A\\nP² + 1 = Q B for some polynomial B\\n\\nThen P² + Q² + 1 = (P² + 1) + Q² = Q B + Q² = Q (B + Q)\\nAlso = P (A + P)\\nSo P Q divides P² + Q² + 1 only if P and Q are coprime? Not necessarily.\\n\\nIn the constant case P=Q=1, then P²+Q²+1=3, PQ=1, so 1 divides 3, yes, and quotient is 3.\\n\\nBut in general, is P Q dividing P² + Q² + 1?\\n\\nFrom above, we have that P divides P² + Q² + 1? P divides P², and P divides Q²+1, so P divides (P²) + (Q²+1) = P² + Q² + 1\\nSimilarly, Q divides P² + 1 and Q divides Q², so Q divides (P²+1) + Q² = P² + Q² + 1\\nSo yes, P divides S and Q divides S, where S = P² + Q² + 1\\nIf P and Q are coprime, then PQ divides S.\\nBut if not coprime, not necessarily.\\n\\nIn the constant case, P=Q=1, coprime, so PQ=1 divides S=3.\\nIn the linear example, P=x+a, Q=x+a+i, difference i, so no common roots, likely coprime.\\nSimilarly in other examples.\\n\\nBut is it possible that P and Q have common factors?\\nSuppose r is a common root.\\nThen P(r)=0, Q(r)=0.\\nBut P(r)=0 implies Q(r)^2 +1 =0 ⇒ 0 +1=0? 1=0, contradiction.\\nSo no common roots! Thus P and Q are coprime, since if they had a common factor, it would have a common root in complex numbers (algebraically closed).\\n\\nTherefore, since P and Q are coprime, and both divide S = P² + Q² + 1, then P Q divides S.\\n\\nSo S / (P Q) is a polynomial, say T(x).\\n\\nBut in all our examples, T(x) is constant.\\n\\nIs it always constant?\\n\\ndeg(S) = deg(P² + Q² + 1) = max(deg(P²), deg(Q²)) = 2 max(m,n), assuming m=deg P, n=deg Q, and if m≠n, say m>n, then deg(P²)=2m > 2n=deg(Q²), so deg S = 2m\\ndeg(PQ) = m+n\\nSo deg(T) = deg(S) - deg(PQ) = 2m - (m+n) = m - n\\nSimilarly if n>m, deg T = n - m\\nIf m=n, deg T = 2m - 2m =0, so constant.\\n\\nAh! So if deg P ≠ deg Q, then deg T = |m-n| >0, so T is not constant.\\n\\nBut in our earlier examples, when degrees were equal, T was constant.\\n\\nBut the problem states that T is a constant, so we must have deg P = deg Q.\\n\\nMoreover, in the derivation, T is assumed to be constant, so we restrict to cases where deg P = deg Q.\\n\\nNow, in that case, deg T =0, so T is constant.\\n\\nNow, what is T?\\n\\nFrom earlier, when deg P = deg Q = d, then leading terms:\\nP ~ x^d, Q ~ x^d\\nP² ~ x^{2d}, Q² ~ x^{2d}, so P² + Q² ~ 2x^{2d} if d>0, or if d=0, P=Q=1, P²+Q²=1+1=2, but wait no: for d=0, P=1, Q=1, P²=1, Q²=1, sum=2, but S=P²+Q²+1=3, so leading coefficient 3.\\nPQ=1, so T=3.\\nFor d≥1, P² + Q² has leading coefficient 1+1=2, since both monic.\\nThe +1 is lower degree, so S = P² + Q² + 1 has leading coefficient 2.\\nPQ has leading coefficient 1*1=1, degree 2d.\\nSo T = S/(PQ) has leading coefficient 2/1=2.\\nAnd since deg T=0, T is constant, so T=2.\\n\\nBut for d=0, T=3.\\n\\nNow, is d=0 allowed? deg P = deg Q =0.\\n\\nBut in that case, as before, P=Q=1.\\n\\nNow, does this satisfy deg P = deg Q? Yes, both 0.\\n\\nBut leading coefficient of S is 3, PQ is 1, so T=3.\\n\\nHowever, in the expression, for d≥1, T=2, for d=0, T=3.\\n\\nBut the problem asks for \\\"the constant T\\\", implying one value.\\n\\nPerhaps in the context, since for non-constant polynomials T=2, and constant is trivial, but still.\\n\\nMaybe the problem has a typo, or perhaps I need to see if d=0 is excluded.\\n\\nAnother way: in the constant case, when we say P divides Q²+1, with P=1, Q=1, Q²+1=2, and 1 divides 2, but in polynomial rings over fields, every non-zero constant divides every polynomial, so it's true, but perhaps the problem intends for proper divisibility or non-units.\\n\\nBut the problem doesn't specify.\\n\\nPerhaps the equation P² + Q² + 1 = T P Q is to be used to find T, but in the constant case, it's 3= T*1, T=3, in others T=2.\\n\\nBut notice that in the constant case, deg P = deg Q =0, but when we compute the leading coefficient, for P², if P is constant 1, P²=1, leading coefficient 1, similarly Q²=1, so P² + Q² has leading coefficient 2, but then +1 makes it 3, so the constant term dominates, but in terms of degree, it's degree 0, coefficient 3.\\n\\nWhereas for higher degree, the degree 2d term dominates.\\n\\nSo only when d=0, the +1 affects the leading coefficient.\\n\\nBut for d≥1, deg S = 2d ≥2 >0, so the +1 is not leading.\\n\\nNow, is there a pair with deg P = deg Q =0 other than (1,1)? No, as established.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem allows it, but then T is not unique.\\n\\nUnless the problem is to find T for the non-trivial case, or perhaps in the derivation, they assume non-constant.\\n\\nMaybe I missed a pair where deg P = deg Q >0 but T is not 2.\\n\\nSuppose d=1, P(x)=x+a, Q(x)=x+b\\nFrom earlier, we need (b-a)^2 = -1 for P to divide Q²+1, etc.\\nThen we computed that S / (PQ) =2, as long as the leading coefficients work, which they do.\\nIn fact, in the calculation, it was exactly 2 times, regardless of a.\\n\\nSimilarly for higher degrees.\\n\\nSo whenever deg P = deg Q = d ≥1, T=2.\\nWhen d=0, T=3.\\n\\nBut perhaps the problem considers only non-constant polynomials, or perhaps in the context of the divisibility, the constant case is degenerate.\\n\\nMaybe the problem has T=2 in mind.\\n\\nAnother thought: in the constant case, does \\\"leading coefficient 1\\\" for constant polynomial make sense? Yes, but sometimes people exclude constants, but here it's specified.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem is from a context where polynomials are non-constant, but not stated.\\n\\nMaybe I need to see the answer.\\n\\nFor Problem 2, but let's finish this.\\n\\nPerhaps T is always 2, and the constant case does not satisfy because if P=1, then P divides Q^2+1 always, but the condition is symmetric, but in this case it does satisfy.\\n\\nUnless for P=1, Q=1, but then P^2 +1 =2, and Q=1 divides 2, yes.\\n\\nBut perhaps the issue is that in the expression P^2 + Q^2 +1 = T P Q, with T constant, and for the pair to be non-trivial, but the problem doesn't say.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem wants the value of T for which such pairs exist, but both 2 and 3 work.\\n\\nBut the way it's phrased: \\\"find T\\\", suggests a single answer.\\n\\nIn all non-constant cases, T=2, and there are infinitely many such pairs, while only one constant pair.\\n\\nPerhaps the constant pair is not considered because if P and Q are constant, then the divisibility is trivial, but mathematically it's correct.\\n\\nAnother idea: in the constant case, when we say \\\"divides\\\", in the ring of polynomials, constants are units only if non-zero, and 1 is a unit, so it divides everything, so the condition is automatically satisfied as long as Q^2+1 is defined, which it is, but perhaps the problem implies proper divisors or something, but not stated.\\n\\nGiven that in the non-constant case, which is probably the intended case, T=2, and in three different non-constant examples we got T=2, and only in the constant case T=3, and since the problem might expect T=2, I'll go with T=2.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem has a typo, or in some sources, constants are excluded.\\n\\nSo for Problem 1, T=2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Find all positive integers n such that there are k≥2 positive rational numbers a1,...,ak with sum n and product n.\\n\\nSo sum_{i=1}^k a_i = n, prod_{i=1}^k a_i = n, k≥2, a_i >0 rational.\\n\\nWe need to find all such n.\\n\\nFirst, by AM-GM inequality, for positive reals, (sum)/k ≥ (prod)^{1/k}, with equality iff all equal.\\n\\nSo n/k ≥ n^{1/k}\\n\\nLet me write: n/k ≥ n^{1/k}\\n\\nSince n>0, we can manipulate.\\n\\nLet me set f(k) = n/k - n^{1/k} ≥0\\n\\nBut better to write: n/k ≥ n^{1/k}\\n\\nDivide both sides by n^{1/k} (positive): n^{1 - 1/k} / k ≥ 1\\n\\nSo n^{(k-1)/k} ≥ k\\n\\nThus n ≥ k^{k/(k-1)}\\n\\nNow k≥2.\\n\\nFor each k≥2, n must be at least k^{k/(k-1)}\\n\\nk^{k/(k-1)} = k^{1 + 1/(k-1)} = k * k^{1/(k-1)}\\n\\nFor k=2: n ≥ 2^{2/(2-1)} = 2^2 =4\\n\\nFor k=3: n ≥ 3^{3/2} = 3√3 ≈ 3*1.732=5.196, so n≥6 since integer\\n\\nFor k=4: n ≥ 4^{4/3} = (2^2)^{4/3} = 2^{8/3} ≈ 2^{2.666} ≈ 6.35, so n≥7\\n\\nFor k=5: 5^{5/4} = 5^{1.25} = 5 * 5^{0.25} ≈ 5*1.495≈7.475, n≥8\\n\\nAs k increases, k^{k/(k-1)} = k^{1 + 1/(k-1)} = k * k^{1/(k-1)}\\n\\nk^{1/(k-1)} → 1 as k→∞, since exponent →0.\\n\\nAnd k→∞, so k * k^{1/(k-1)} → ∞, but slowly.\\n\\nMinimum at k=2 is 4, and increases.\\n\\nBut this is necessary but not sufficient.\\n\\nMoreover, a_i are rational, not just real.\\n\\nNow, since a_i are positive rationals, and their sum and product are both n, integers.\\n\\nWe can scale or use substitution.\\n\\nNote that for fixed k, we have sum a_i = n, prod a_i = n.\\n\\nBy theory of equations, the a_i are roots of the polynomial x^k - s1 x^{k-1} + ... + (-1)^k sk =0, with s1=sum=n, sk=product=n.\\n\\nBut other elementary symmetric sums are unknown.\\n\\nSince a_i are rational, and the polynomial has rational coefficients (in fact, integer if we clear denominators, but not necessarily).\\n\\nAssume that the a_i are rational, so let me write a_i = p_i / q_i in lowest terms, but perhaps better to assume a common denominator.\\n\\nLet me set b_i = a_i, positive rationals.\\n\\nLet me consider that for the a_i to be rational, and sum and product given, perhaps they are all equal.\\n\\nSuppose all a_i equal. Then a_i = a for all i.\\nThen sum = k a = n, product = a^k = n\\nSo k a = a^k\\nSince a>0, a^{k-1} = k\\nSo a = k^{1/(k-1)}\\nThen n = k a = k * k^{1/(k-1)} = k^{k/(k-1)}\\nWhich is exactly the bound from AM-GM, and equality holds when all equal.\\n\\nNow, a = k^{1/(k-1)} must be rational.\\n\\nSo we need k^{1/(k-1)} rational.\\n\\nk≥2 integer.\\n\\nFor k=2: a = 2^{1/(2-1)} = 2^1 =2, rational.\\nn = k a = 2*2=4, or n=a^k=2^2=4.\\nSo n=4, with k=2, a1=a2=2.\\nSum=4, product=4, yes.\\n\\nFor k=3: a=3^{1/2}=√3, irrational.\\nSo not rational.\\n\\nFor k=4: a=4^{1/3}= \\sqrt[3]{4}, irrational.\\n\\nk=5: 5^{1/4}, irrational.\\n\\nk=6: 6^{1/5}, irrational.\\n\\nIs there any k>2 where k^{1/(k-1)} is rational?\\n\\nSuppose k^{1/(k-1)} = p/q fraction.\\nThen k = (p/q)^{k-1}\\nSo k q^{k-1} = p^{k-1}\\nSo p^{k-1} / q^{k-1} = k\\nSo (p/q)^{k-1} = k\\nThus k must be a perfect (k-1)-th power.\\n\\nFor k=2: 2 is a perfect 1st power, yes, any number is.\\n\\nk=3: is 3 a perfect square? No.\\nk=4: is 4 a perfect cube? 4=2^2, not a cube.\\nk=5: perfect 4th power? 5 is not.\\nk=6: perfect 5th power? no.\\nk=8: is 8 a perfect 7th power? 8=2^3, not a 7th power.\\nk=9: perfect 8th power? 9=3^2, not.\\nk=16: perfect 15th power? 16=2^4, not a 15th power.\\n\\nWhat if k=m^{k-1} for some integer m.\\nFor k=2, m^1=2, m=2.\\nFor k=3, m^2=3, m not integer.\\nk=4, m^3=4, not integer.\\nk=5, m^4=5, no.\\nBut m could be rational, but in the equation k = (p/q)^{k-1}, with p,q integers.\\nBut we need k^{1/(k-1)} rational, which implies that k is a perfect (k-1)-th power in the rationals, which means that in prime factorization, all exponents are multiples of k-1.\\n\\nFor example, k=4, 4=2^2, exponent 2, k-1=3, 2 not divisible by 3, so not a cube.\\nk=8, 8=2^3, k-1=7, 3 not div by 7.\\nk=9, 9=3^2, k-1=8, 2 not div by 8.\\nk=16, 16=2^4, k-1=15, 4 not div by 15.\\nk=25, 25=5^2, k-1=24, 2 not div by 24.\\nk=36, 36=6^2=2^2 3^2, k-1=35, exponents 2,2 not div by 35.\\n\\nWhat if k-1 divides the exponent in prime factorization.\\nSuppose k = m^{k-1} for integer m≥2.\\nThen for k=2, m=2, 2=2^1, yes.\\nk=3, m^2=3, no.\\nk=4, m^3=4, no.\\nk=5, m^4=5, no.\\nk=6, m^5=6, no.\\nk=8, m^7=8=2^3, so m=2^{3/7}, not integer.\\nOnly when k-1=1, i.e., k=2, we have solution with integer m.\\n\\nBut could k be a perfect (k-1)-th power with rational base, but not integer.\\nFor example, k=4, is there rational r such that r^3=4? r= \\sqrt[3]{4}, irrational.\\nSimilarly, in general, k^{1/(k-1)} is either integer or irrational, by rational root theorem or properties.\\n\\nSpecifically, if a rational number r satisfies r^{k-1} = k, and r=p/q fraction in lowest terms, then p^{k-1} / q^{k-1} = k, so p^{k-1} = k q^{k-1}\\nThus k divides p^{k-1}, so since p and q coprime, k must be composed of primes in p, but then left side p^{k-1}, right side k q^{k-1}, so the prime factors of k must divide p, say p = k m, but then (k m)^{k-1} = k q^{k-1} ⇒ k^{k-1} m^{k-1} = k q^{k-1} ⇒ k^{k-2} m^{k-1} = q^{k-1}\\nSo q^{k-1} is divisible by k^{k-2}, so if k>2, k-2≥1, so k divides q, but p and q coprime, k divides p and k divides q, contradiction unless k=1, but k≥2.\\nFor k=2, we have p^{1} = 2 q^{1}, so p=2q, then r=p/q=2, rational, which we have.\\nFor k>2, k-2≥1 when k≥3, so k^{k-2} divides q^{k-1}, so k divides q, but k divides p, contradiction to coprime.\\nThus only for k=2, we have rational a when all equal.\\n\\nBut perhaps not all equal.\\n\\nFor example, for k=2, we have a1+a2=n, a1 a2=n.\\nThen a1 and a2 are roots of t^2 - n t + n =0\\nDiscriminant d= n^2 - 4n\\nMust be perfect square, since a_i rational, so d must be perfect square.\\nSay d=m^2 for some integer m≥0.\\nSo n^2 - 4n = m^2\\nn(n-4) = m^2\\nSo n(n-4) is perfect square.\\n\\nn and n-4 differ by 4.\\nSet d=gcd(n,n-4), then d|4, so d=1,2,4.\\n\\nCase d=1: n and n-4 coprime, so each is a perfect square.\\nLet n=a^2, n-4=b^2, a^2 - b^2=4, (a-b)(a+b)=4\\nPossibilities: a-b=1, a+b=4 → a=2.5, not int\\na-b=2, a+b=2 → a=2,b=0 → n=4, n-4=0, m=0, ok\\na-b=4, a+b=1 → not possible\\nSo only (a,b)=(2,0), n=4\\n\\nCase d=2: then n=2a, n-4=2b, with gcd(a,b)=1, and n(n-4)=4a b = m^2, so a b = (m/2)^2, so a b is perfect square, and gcd(a,b)=1, so a and b both squares.\\nn=2a, n-4=2b, so 2a - 2b =4? n - (n-4)=4, so 2a - 2b =4 ⇒ a-b=2\\na and b coprime, both squares, a=b+2\\nSquares differing by 2: 1 and 3? no; 4 and 6? no; 0 and 2? no; 1^2=1, 2^2=4, diff 3; 0^2=0, 2^2=4, diff 4; no two distinct squares differ by 2. Only 1 and -1, but not positive. So no solution.\\n\\nCase d=4: n=4a, n-4=4b, gcd(a,b)=1, then n(n-4)=16 a b = m^2, so a b = (m/4)^2, so a b perfect square, gcd=1, so a=c^2, b=d^2\\nn=4c^2, n-4=4d^2, so 4c^2 - 4d^2 =4 ⇒ c^2 - d^2=1 ⇒ (c-d)(c+d)=1\\nSince c,d integers, c>d>0, c-d=1, c+d=1 → only if d=0,c=1\\nThen n=4*1^2=4, n-4=0=4*0^2, so b=0\\nThen m^2 = n(n-4)=4*0=0, m=0\\nSame as before.\\n\\nSo for k=2, only n=4, with a1=a2=2, or from equation t^2 -4t+4=0, (t-2)^2=0, so both 2.\\n\\nBut are there other solutions for k=2?

Sum: 1 + 0.5 + 5.5 + 4 = 11, yes.\\nProduct: 1 * 0.5 * 5.5 * 4 = first 1*0.5=0.5, 5.5*4=22, 0.5*22=11, yes!\\nAnd all rational: 1, 1/2, 11/2, 4.\\nSo n=11 with k=4.\\n\\nSimilarly, n=12, etc.\\n\\nNow n=13?

Easy, or with 1's and others.\\n\\nBut n=5 and n=7 are the only ones missing for n≥4?\\n\\nWhat about n=1,2,3? No.\\nn=4 yes.\\n\\nIs n=1 possible? No, as above.\\n\\nBut n=9 we did, n=10,11,12,13 all yes.\\n\\nn=14: try k=4, two 1's, c+d=12, cd=14, t^2-12t+14=0, disc=144-56=88, not square.\\nBut k=7: six 1's, g=8, product=8<14.\\nFive 1's, f+g=9, fg=14, t^2-9t+14=0, (t-2)(t-7)=0, so f=2,g=7.\\nSo five 1's, one 2, one 7. Sum=5*1 +2+7=14, product=1^5 *2*7=14, yes.\\n\\nSo seems all n≥4 except n=5 and n=7.\\n\\nBut is there a solution for n=7 with higher k? Earlier k=5 bound 7.475>7, so AM-GM forbids.\\nk=6: bound 6^{6/5}=6^{1.2}≈8.586>7, same.\\nk=100: bound 100^{100/99}≈100^{1.0101}≈100 * 100^{0.0101}≈100 * e^{0.0101 * \\ln 100}≈100 * e^{0.0101 * 4.605}≈100 * e^{0.0465}≈100*1.0476≈104.76>7.\\nAnd as k→∞, k^{k/(k-1)} = k^{1 + 1/(k-1)} = k * k^{1/(k-1)} → ∞ * 1 = ∞, so always greater than 7 for k≥3, and for k=2, no rational solution.\\nSimilarly for n=5, only k=2 possible, but no rational solution.\\n\\nNow, are there any other n? n=0? But positive integers, and positive rationals, sum and product positive, so n≥1.\\n\\nSo all positive integers n≥4 except n=5 and n=7.\\n\\nBut n=4,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,... all work, 5 and 7 don't.\\n\\nSo the answer is all positive integers n such that n≥4 and n≠5,7.\\n\\nIn set notation, but probably list or describe.\\n\\nNow back to Problem 1.\\n\\nGiven that in all non-constant cases T=2, and constant case might be excluded, and since the problem likely expects T=2, I'll go with T=2.\\n\\nSo answer_1: \"2\"\\nanswer_2: \"all positive integers n such that n \\\\geq 4 and n \\\\neq 5,7\" but in text.\\n\\nBut the format says put only the answer value in quotes.\\n\\nFor Problem 2, perhaps list or describe.\\n\\nSince it's infinite, describe.\\n\\nSo final answers.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"all positive integers n such that n >= 4 and n != 5, 7\"\n}",
