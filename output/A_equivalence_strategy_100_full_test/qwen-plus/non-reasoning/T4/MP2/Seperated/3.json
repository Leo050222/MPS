The multiplicative order of 2 modulo r being 2 means that:\\n\\n- 2^2 ≡ 1 (mod r), and \\n- 2^1 ≢ 1 (mod r).\\n\\nSo, 4 ≡ 1 (mod r) ⇒ r divides 3. Thus, r | 3. Since r is a prime, the only possibility is r = 3.\\n\\nCheck: Does the order of 2 mod 3 equal 2?\\n- 2^1 = 2 ≡ 2 mod 3 ≠ 1\\n- 2^2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3 → yes, order is 2.\\n\\nThus, r = 3 ⇒ k = r - 2 = 1.\\n\\nTherefore, answer_1 = \\\"1\\\".\\n\\nProblem 2: We start with n copies of 1 on the blackboard. Each move:\\n- Erases two numbers a and b\\n- Replaces them with 1 and a + b\\n- Adds 1 stone to first bucket (so s increases by 1)\\n- Adds gcd(a, b) stones to second bucket (so t increases by gcd(a, b))\\n\\nWe perform moves until only two numbers remain? Actually, we keep going as long as there are at least two numbers to erase. Initially, there are n numbers. Each move reduces the count of numbers on the board by 1 (remove 2, add 2 ⇒ net 0? Wait: remove two, add two: 1 and a+b ⇒ so number count stays same? That can't be.)\\n\\nWait: initial count: n numbers.\\nEach move: erase two (−2), write two (+2): so total count remains same? Then we can do infinitely many moves? But problem says “after some finite number of moves” and buckets are non-empty positive integers s and t.\\n\\nBut the process must terminate. So likely: we continue until... perhaps when only one number is left? But it says replace with two numbers: 1 and a+b. So number count is preserved: always n numbers.\\n\\nWait — contradiction unless the process doesn't end. But the problem says “after some finite number of moves”, not that the process stops. So we just do some finite number of moves (could be any), and at that point have s and t in the buckets, and we want possible values of t/s over all such possible sequences.\\n\\nLet’s analyze invariants or totals.\\n\\nLet S be the sum of numbers on the board. Initially: n × 1 = n.\\nIn a move: remove a and b, add 1 and a+b. So change in sum: (1 + a + b) − (a + b) = 1. So sum increases by 1 per move.\\n\\nSo after m moves, sum = n + m.\\n\\nAlso, each move adds 1 to first bucket ⇒ s = number of moves = m.\\nEach move adds gcd(a,b) to second bucket ⇒ t = sum of gcd(a,b) over all moves.\\n\\nSo t = Σ gcd(a_i, b_i) over the m moves.\\n\\nWe want possible values of t/s = (Σ gcd(a_i, b_i)) / m, over all possible sequences of moves starting from n ones, for fixed n ≥ 3.\\n\\nWe need to find all possible rational numbers that can arise as t/s.\\n\\nNote: all numbers on the board are positive integers at all times.\\n\\nStart with [1,1,...,1] (n times).\\n\\nTry small n, say n = 3.\\nInitial: [1,1,1]\\n\\nMove 1: pick two 1s: a=1, b=1\\n→ replace with 1 and 1+1=2\\nNow board: [1,1,2] (but we had three, removed two, added two ⇒ still three: e.g., 1,1,2)\\ns = 1, t += gcd(1,1)=1 ⇒ t=1 ⇒ t/s = 1\\n\\nCan we do another move? Yes.\\nOption: pick 1 and 1: gcd=1 → new numbers: 1 and 2 → now [2,2,1]? Wait: remove two 1s → left with 2, then add 1 and 2 → so [2,1,2] → same as before.\\nSum was 3 initially, after first move sum=4, after second move sum=5.\\ns=2, t=1+1=2 ⇒ t/s=1\\n\\nOr from [1,1,2], pick 1 and 2: gcd(1,2)=1 → replace with 1 and 3 → now [1,1,3]\\ns=2, t=1+1=2 ⇒ ratio=1\\n\\nAlways getting gcd=1 so far.\\n\\nCan we ever get gcd > 1?\\nSuppose we have two even numbers. But we start with all 1s (odd). When do we get even numbers?\\n- a and b both odd: a+b even\\n- a odd, b even: a+b odd\\n- both even: a+b even\\n\\nBut we introduce 1 every time. So there's always at least one 1? Not necessarily: we replace two numbers with 1 and a+b. So we always insert a 1. So at every move, we add a 1. So the number of 1s may vary, but since we add one each time, and possibly remove one or two.\\n\\nLet c be the count of 1s on the board.\\nInitially: c = n.\\nIn a move: we erase two numbers a and b. Cases:\\n- If we erase two 1s: then we add back one 1 ⇒ c decreases by 1 (lose two, gain one)\\n- If we erase one 1 and one x≠1: then we remove one 1, add one 1 ⇒ c unchanged\\n- If we erase two numbers both ≠1: then we remove no 1s, add one 1 ⇒ c increases by 1\\n\\nSo c can go up and down.\\n\\nBut can we create a situation where two numbers greater than 1 have a common divisor >1?\\nFor example, can we get two even numbers?\\nYes: first move: take two 1s → get 1 and 2. Now have one 2 and two 1s (if n=3). Count of 1s: was 3, erased two 1s, added one 1 ⇒ now two 1s and one 2.\\nNow do another move: take two 1s → get 1 and 2. Now numbers: 2,2,1. Two evens!\\nNow do a move: take the two 2s: a=2, b=2, gcd=2\\n→ replace with 1 and 4\\nNow board: 1,4,1 (and the other 1?) Wait: had [2,2,1], remove two 2s, left with 1, add 1 and 4 ⇒ [1,1,4]\\ns = 3 (three moves), t = 1 (first) + 1 (second) + 2 (third) = 4 ⇒ t/s = 4/3\\n\\nSo ratio 4/3 is achievable for n=3.\\n\\nPreviously we had 1, now 4/3.\\n\\nCan we get higher?\\nFrom [1,1,4], we could take two 1s: gcd=1 → get 1 and 2 → [1,2,4]\\ns=4, t=4+1=5 ⇒ t/s=5/4=1.25 < 4/3≈1.33\\nOr take 1 and 4: gcd=1 → get 1 and 5 → [1,1,5] → t=5, s=4 → 5/4\\nOr take 1 and 2: gcd=1 → same\\n\\nFrom [1,2,4], take 2 and 4: gcd=2 → replace with 1 and 6 → [1,1,6]\\ns=4, t=4+2=6? Wait: previous t was 4 after 3 moves, this is fourth move: add gcd(2,4)=2 ⇒ t=6, s=4 ⇒ t/s=6/4=3/2=1.5\\nBetter.\\n\\nThen from [1,1,6], take two 1s: gcd=1 → get 1 and 2 → [1,2,6]\\ns=5, t=7\\nThen take 2 and 6: gcd=2 → get 1 and 8 → [1,1,8]\\ns=6, t=9 ⇒ t/s=9/6=3/2\\nSame.\\nOr from [1,2,6], take 1 and 2: gcd=1 → [1,1,6] again\\n\\nFrom [1,1,6], take 1 and 6: gcd=1 → [1,1,7] etc.\\n\\nCan we get gcd=3?\\nNeed two multiples of 3.\\nHow to get a multiple of 3?\\nSum increases by 1 each move, but values depend.\\nSuppose we have two numbers divisible by 3.\\nStart: all 1s.\\nAfter several moves, suppose we form a 3: e.g., take 1 and 2 → get 1 and 3. So we can get 3.\\nBut to get two 3s?\\nGet first 3: from 1 and 2. To get 2: from 1+1.\\nSo: move1: 1,1 → 1,2 → now [1,2,1] for n=3\\nmove2: 1,2 → 1,3 → now [1,1,3]\\nmove3: 1,1 → 1,2 → [1,2,3]\\nmove4: 1,2 → 1,3 → [1,3,3]\\nNow we have two 3s.\\nmove5: take two 3s: gcd=3 → replace with 1 and 6 → [1,1,6]\\ns=5 moves so far? Let's track:\\nAfter move1: s=1, t=1 (gcd(1,1)=1)\\nmove2: gcd(1,2)=1 → s=2, t=2\\nmove3: gcd(1,1)=1 → s=3, t=3\\nmove4: gcd(1,2)=1 → s=4, t=4\\nmove5: gcd(3,3)=3 → s=5, t=7 → t/s=7/5=1.4\\nLess than 3/2=1.5\\n\\nBut earlier we got 3/2.\\n\\nCan we get higher than 3/2?\\nTry to maximize average gcd.\\nNote that every move adds gcd(a,b) to t and 1 to s, so t/s is the average of the gcds over the moves.\\nWe want possible values of this average.\\n\\nObserve: the process can simulate building a tree or something, but let's think about invariants.\\n\\nAnother idea: consider the total sum.\\nAfter m moves, sum = n + m, as established.\\nAlso, the numbers on the board are positive integers, and their sum is n + m.\\n\\nBut more importantly, note that each time we introduce a 1, and we start with n ones.\\nEach move consumes two numbers and produces a new sum element a+b, and reinserts a 1.\\nThe key is that the multiset evolves.\\n\\nBut notice: every number that appears on the board is a positive integer, and in fact, since we start from 1s and form sums, all numbers are positive integers, and moreover, the entire process resembles a variant of the Euclidean algorithm or heap operations.\\n\\nBut let's think about what values t/s can take.\\nFrom examples:\\n- For n=3, we achieved t/s = 1, 4/3≈1.33, 3/2=1.5, 7/5=1.4, 5/4=1.25, etc.\\n\\nIs 2 possible? Can we get t/s=2?\\nThat would require average gcd=2.\\nSo most moves must have gcd≥2, ideally many with gcd=2.\\nBut early moves involve 1s, and gcd with 1 is 1.\\nHow many moves involve at least one 1?\\nNot clear.\\n\\nNote that whenever we pick two numbers both greater than 1, we increase the count of 1s by 1 (since we add a 1 but remove no 1s).\\nWhen we pick one 1 and one non-1, count of 1s stays same.\\nWhen we pick two 1s, count of 1s decreases by 1.\\n\\nInitially, c = n.\\nLet m be total moves.\\nLet A = number of moves where we picked two 1s\\nB = number of moves where we picked one 1 and one non-1\\nC = number of moves where we picked two non-1s\\nThen m = A + B + C\\n\\nChange in count of 1s: each type A move: Δc = -1\\nType B: Δc = 0\\nType C: Δc = +1\\nNet change in c: -A + 0 + C\\nInitial c = n\\nFinal c = n - A + C\\n\\nBut final c ≥ 0, obviously.\\nAlso, at all times c ≥ 0.\\n\\nBut more importantly, we can relate to the process.\\n\\nNow, the total contribution to t:\\n- Type A: gcd(1,1)=1 ⇒ contributes 1\\n- Type B: gcd(1,x)=1 for any x ⇒ contributes 1\\n- Type C: gcd(a,b) where a>1, b>1, so gcd≥1, but could be >1\\n\\nSo t = A * 1 + B * 1 + C * g_c, where g_c ≥1 is the gcd in that move, but varies.\\nBut minimum: if all type C have gcd=1, then t = A+B+C = m ⇒ t/s=1\\nMaximum: we want to maximize t, so maximize sum of gcds in type C moves.\\n\\nBut t = A + B + Σ_{type C} gcd_i\\nSince A + B + C = m, t = m - C + Σ_{type C} gcd_i = m + Σ_{type C} (gcd_i - 1)\\n\\nSo t/s = t/m = 1 + (1/m) Σ_{i in C} (gcd_i - 1)\\n\\nSo the excess over 1 comes from the type C moves, weighted by how many there are and how large gcd_i -1 is.\\n\\nTo maximize t/s, we want many type C moves with high gcd.\\n\\nBut we are to find all possible values, not just max.\\n\\nNow, crucially, can we make t/s arbitrarily close to any value? Probably not, since discrete.\\n\\nBut the problem asks for all possible values of the ratio t/s, for fixed n≥3, over all possible sequences.\\n\\nNow, from the expression t/s = 1 + (1/m) Σ_C (gcd_i - 1)\\nEach term (gcd_i -1) is a non-negative integer, since gcd_i ≥1.\\nSo t/s ≥1, and t/s is a rational number.\\n\\nMoreover, t/s = 1 + K/m, where K = Σ_C (gcd_i -1) ≥0 is an integer.\\nSo t/s = (m + K)/m = 1 + K/m\\n\\nBut K depends on the moves.\\n\\nIs every rational number ≥1 achievable? No, because m and K are constrained by n.\\n\\nBut for fixed n, as m can be arbitrary large (we can keep doing moves forever?), is that allowed?\\nThe problem says “after some finite number of moves”, so m can be any positive integer, in principle, as long as we can perform m moves.\\n\\nCan we perform arbitrarily many moves?\\nYes, because we always have numbers on the board, and we can always pick, for example, a 1 and another number, as long as there is a 1.\\nBut is there always a 1?\\nNo: suppose we never do type C moves, and we keep doing type A or B.\\nBut if we do a type C move, we add a 1, so c increases.\\nActually, we always add a 1 in every move, so after each move, there is at least one 1 on the board? Not necessarily: we add one 1, but we might remove it later.\\nBut immediately after a move, we have added a 1, so at that instant, there is a 1.\\nBut for the next move, we might choose to remove that 1.\\nHowever, since we add a 1 in every move, the total number of 1s can fluctuate, but we can always find a 1? Not guaranteed, but actually, after each move, we place a 1, so unless we remove it in subsequent moves, it's there.\\nBut since we can choose which pair to erase, we can avoid removing 1s if we want, but for existence of moves, as long as there are at least two numbers, we can pick any two.\\nAnd since we always have n numbers, and n≥3≥2, we can always perform a move, regardless.\\nSo yes, we can perform arbitrarily many moves.\\n\\nTherefore, m can be any positive integer.\\n\\nNow, can we achieve any rational number of the form 1 + K/m for some integer K≥0?\\nThat is, t/s = (m + K)/m\\n\\nBut K = Σ_C (gcd_i -1)\\n\\nWe need to see what values K can take for given m.\\n\\nNote that K depends on how many type C moves we do and what gcds we achieve.\\n\\nBut we can try to minimize or maximize K.\\n\\nFirst, minimum K: if we never do type C moves, or do them with gcd=1, then K=0, t/s=1.\\nCan we avoid type C moves? Yes, for example, always pick a 1 and another number. Since there is always at least one 1? Is there?\\nAfter each move, we add a 1, so yes, after move i, there is a 1. At the beginning, there are 1s. So at any point before a move, since the last move added a 1, there is at least one 1 on the board. Therefore, we can always pick a 1 and any other number (since n≥3, there are at least two other numbers? No: total n numbers, one is 1, others may be few, but n≥3, so at least two others? No: n numbers total. If one is 1, there are n-1 ≥2 others, so yes, plenty.\\nWe can always pick a 1 and a non-1, which is type B move, gcd=1, so t increases by 1, s by 1, t/s remains whatever, but if we do only such moves, t=s, ratio=1.\\nBut we can also pick two 1s, if available.\\n\\nBut to get K>0, we need type C moves with gcd>1.\\n\\nCan we make K arbitrarily large?\\nFor example, can we make t/s arbitrarily large?\\nSuppose we want large gcd. Say, we want to create two large equal numbers.\\nFor instance, build two copies of a large number M, then pick them, gcd=M, so contribute M to t, while m increases by 1, so t/s gets a boost of M.\\nBut to build two Ms, we need many moves.\\nFor example, to build a large number, we need to sum many 1s, but the process is constrained.\\nNote that each number on the board is formed through a series of additions, but with insertion of 1s.\\n\\nThe sum of all numbers is n + m.\\nBy Cauchy-Schwarz or just average, the maximum number is at most n + m.\\nIf we have two numbers equal to M, then 2M ≤ n + m.\\nWhen we pick them, gcd ≥1, but if they are equal, gcd=M, so we add M to t.\\nBut M ≤ (n+m)/2\\nSo the contribution to t is at most (n+m)/2\\nBut this is for one move.\\nK for that move is M -1 ≈ (n+m)/2\\nThen t/s = 1 + K/m ≈ 1 + (n+m)/(2m) = 1 + n/(2m) + 1/2\\nAs m increases, this goes to 1.5, but for fixed m, bounded.\\nBut we can do multiple such moves.\\nHowever, after we pick two Ms, we replace with 1 and 2M, so we lose the two Ms.\\nThen we need to rebuild.\\nBut 2M is larger, so we might use that.\\n\\nSuppose we repeatedly create large equal numbers.\\nBut it might be inefficient.\\n\\nNote that in the expression t/s = 1 + K/m, and K is sum over type C moves of (gcd_i -1)\\nEach gcd_i ≤ min(a,b) ≤ sqrt(sum) or something, but roughly, since sum is n+m, gcd_i ≤ n+m\\nBut more importantly, the total sum of all gcd contributions is limited.\\n\\nBut actually, t can be as large as we want by making m large and having large gcds.\\nFor example, can we achieve t/s = 2?\\nSet 1 + K/m = 2 ⇒ K/m =1 ⇒ K=m\\nSo we need Σ_C (gcd_i -1) = m\\nBut K = Σ_C (gcd_i -1) ≤ Σ_C gcd_i ≤ t, but more relevantly, since each gcd_i -1 ≥0, and number of type C moves is C, so K ≤ C * G_max, but G_max ≤ n+m\\nBut we need K=m\\nSo m ≤ C * (n+m)\\nWhich is true for large m, but we need equality K=m.\\n\\nCan we arrange that in every move, gcd_i -1 =1? That is, gcd_i=2 for all type C moves, and no other moves? But we have to have moves, and if we only do type C moves, but type C requires two non-1s.\\nBut initially, all are 1s, so we cannot do type C first move.\\nWe must start with type A or B.\\nType A: two 1s, gcd=1, so K contribution 0\\nType B: one 1 and one non-1, but initially no non-1, so first move must be type A (since at least two 1s, n≥3)\\nSo first move: type A, gcd=1, so contributes 0 to K\\nSimilarly, early moves likely have gcd=1\\n\\nSuppose we do A type A moves initially to create some 2s.\\nFor example, each type A move: consume two 1s, produce a 2 and a 1, so net: one less 1, one more 2\\nAfter k such moves, number of 1s: n - k, number of 2s: k, and other numbers? Only these, sum = 1*(n-k) + 2*k = n + k, which matches n + m since m=k\\nNow, if we have at least two 2s, we can do a type C move: pick two 2s, gcd=2, so contributes gcd-1=1 to K\\nAfter move: remove two 2s, add 1 and 4\\nSo now: 1s: (n-k) +1 = n-k+1 (since we add a 1), 2s: k-2, and a 4\\nCount of 1s increased by 1\\nWe can repeat.\\nTo do a type C move on two 2s, we need at least two 2s.\\nSuppose we do many type A moves first.\\nSay, do a type A moves, creating a twos.\\nThen we can do floor(a/2) type C moves on pairs of 2s.\\nEach such move: consumes two 2s, produces a 4 and a 1\\nAfter d such moves, we have consumed 2d twos, produced d fours and d ones\\nSo total: 1s: (n - a) + d + d = n - a + 2d  (initial 1s were n-a, plus d from type C moves, but each type C adds one 1, and we didn't remove any 1s in type C, so yes)\\n2s: a - 2d\\n4s: d\\nNow, we can do type C moves on two 4s, if we have at least two 4s.\\nEach such move: gcd(4,4)=4, so contributes 4-1=3 to K\\nProduces 1 and 8\\nAnd so on.\\n\\nTo maximize K, we can build powers of 2.\\nBut for achieving specific ratios, perhaps we can achieve any rational ≥1.\\nBut earlier for n=3, we got 1, 4/3, 3/2, 7/5, etc.\\n3/2=1.5, 4/3≈1.333, 7/5=1.4\\nCan we get 5/3≈1.666? Or 2?\\nTry to get t/s=2.\\nNeed t=2s, so sum of gcds = 2m\\nSince each gcd≥1, sum ≥m, we need average gcd=2.\\nSo half the moves must have gcd≥2, etc.\\nSuppose we do moves to create large gcds.\\nFor example, build two large equal numbers.\\nSuppose we want to create two numbers of size M.\\nHow many moves to create one number of size M?\\nEach number is formed by summing smaller ones, but with the insertion of 1s, it's like the number represents a sum of a subset, but not exactly, because the 1s are inserted.\\nActually, each number on the board at any time can be seen as corresponding to a leaf in a binary tree, but the process is complex.\\n\\nNote that every time we do a move, we are essentially combining two numbers into a sum, but adding a new 1.\\nThe total sum increases by 1 per move, as established.\\nNow, the key insight might be that the final value of t/s can be any rational number greater than or equal to 1.\\nBut is 1.1 achievable? Say 11/10.\\nNeed t/s=11/10, so for m=10, t=11, so sum of gcds=11, so average gcd=1.1, so mostly gcd=1, one gcd=2.\\nCan we arrange that in 10 moves, we have nine moves with gcd=1 and one with gcd=2?\\nYes: for example, do moves that mostly involve 1s, but once create a situation with two even numbers and pick them.\\nFor n=3: start with [1,1,1]\\nDo several type B moves: but to do type B, we need a non-1.\\nFirst, do a type A: pick two 1s → get 1 and 2 → now [1,1,2]\\nNow, we can do type B: pick 1 and 2 → gcd=1 → get 1 and 3 → [1,1,3]\\nOr pick two 1s → get 1 and 2 → [1,2,2]\\nNow [1,2,2], we can pick two 2s: gcd=2 → get 1 and 4 → [1,1,4]\\nThis is one move with gcd=2, others with gcd=1.\\nMoves: move1: type A, gcd=1\\nmove2: type A, gcd=1? From [1,1,2], pick two 1s: but there are two 1s and one 2, so yes, pick two 1s → get 1 and 2 → now [2,2,1] same as before\\nAfter move1: [1,1,2]\\nmoves: pick two 1s: a=1,b=1,gcd=1 → replace with 1 and 2 → so now numbers: 2 (the old one), and new 1 and 2 → [1,2,2]\\ns=2, t=1+1=2\\nThen move3: pick two 2s: gcd=2 → get 1 and 4 → [1,1,4]\\ns=3, t=4\\nSo after 3 moves, t=4, s=3, ratio=4/3\\nTo get ratio 11/10, need later moves with gcd=1.\\nFrom [1,1,4], we can keep doing moves like pick 1 and 4: gcd=1 → get 1 and 5 → [1,1,5]\\nEach such move: s++, t+=1, so t/s approaches 1.\\nAfter k additional moves, s=3+k, t=4+k, ratio=(4+k)/(3+k)\\nSet (4+k)/(3+k) = 11/10? Then 10(4+k)=11(3+k) => 40+10k=33+11k => 40-33=11k-10k =>7=k\\nSo after k=7 more moves, s=3+7=10, t=4+7=11, ratio=11/10.\\nAnd each additional move: from [1,1,x], pick 1 and x → gcd=1 → get 1 and x+1 → [1,1,x+1], so yes, we can do this.\\nStart with x=4, after first: [1,1,5], then [1,1,6], ..., up to [1,1,11] after 7 moves.\\nAll moves have gcd=1 except the third move which had gcd=2.\\nTotal t=1 (m1) +1 (m2) +2 (m3) +1*7 = 4+7=11, s=10, yes.\\nSo 11/10 is achievable for n=3.\\n\\nSimilarly, can we achieve any rational r ≥1?\\nGiven any rational r = p/q ≥1, we want t/s = p/q.\\nSet s = m, t = k, k/m = p/q, so we need k/m = p/q, so set m = q d, k = p d for some d.\\nBut k and m are determined by the sequence.\\nWe can probably achieve any rational ≥1 by first doing some moves to get a certain t and s, then doing many gcd=1 moves to adjust the ratio.\\nSpecifically, suppose at some point we have done a moves, with t=a, s=a (all gcd=1 so far), ratio=1.\\nBut we need ratio >1, so we need to do a move with gcd>1.\\nSuppose we do a sequence that includes one move with gcd=g>1, and the rest gcd=1.\\nThen after b moves, t = (b-1)*1 + g = b -1 + g, s=b, ratio=(b-1+g)/b = 1 + (g-1)/b\\nAs b increases, this approaches 1, and for fixed g, we can get ratios 1 + (g-1)/b for b≥1.\\nBut b has to be at least the number of moves to set up the high gcd move.\\nFor example, to get gcd=2, we need at least two 2s, which takes at least two moves (create first 2, then second 2), and then the third move to combine them.\\nAfter two moves: if both type A, s=2, t=2, ratio=1\\nThen move3: combine two 2s, gcd=2, s=3, t=4, ratio=4/3\\nThen we can do additional moves with gcd=1, say c more moves, then s=3+c, t=4+c, ratio=(4+c)/(3+c)\\nAs c→∞, ratio→1, and for c=0, 4/3, c=1,5/4, c=2,6/5, etc.\\nSo we get ratios (4+c)/(3+c) for c≥0\\nSimilarly, if we do a move with gcd=3, say.\\nTo get two 3s: need to create them.\\nFor example: move1: 1,1→1,2 → [1,1,2]\\nmove2: 1,2→1,3 → [1,1,3]\\nmove3: 1,1→1,2 → [1,2,3]\\nmove4: 1,2→1,3 → [1,3,3]\\nmove5: 3,3→1,6 → gcd=3, so t gets +3\\nAfter 4 moves, if all gcd=1, t=4, s=4\\nAfter move5: s=5, t=4+3=7, ratio=7/5\\nThen additional c moves with gcd=1: s=5+c, t=7+c, ratio=(7+c)/(5+c)\\nSimilarly, for gcd=g move, we can get ratios (a + g + c) / (b + c) where a,b are t,s before the high gcd move, but in this case, before move5, s=4,t=4, after move5: s=5,t=7, then after c more: s=5+c,t=7+c\\nGenerally, after a high gcd move with gcd=g, if before it s=m0, t=t0, after it s=m0+1, t=t0+g\\nThen after c more gcd=1 moves: s=m0+1+c, t=t0+g+c\\nRatio = (t0 + g + c) / (m0 + 1 + c)\\nNow, t0 and m0 depend on the path to set up the high gcd move.\\nBut in the examples, when we do the high gcd move, often t0 = m0, because all previous moves had gcd=1.\\nIs that necessary? Not necessarily, but we can arrange it.\\nFor example, in the gcd=2 case, before the third move, after two type A moves, s=2,t=2.\\nFor gcd=3, after four moves, s=4,t=4.\\nSimilarly, to get two 4s: after move5: [1,1,4] from earlier, but to get two 4s.\\nFrom [1,1,4], do type A: pick two 1s → get 1,2 → [2,4,1] wait\\nBetter: move1:1,1→1,2 →[1,1,2]\\nmove2:1,1→1,2 →[2,2,1]\\nmove3:2,2→1,4 →[1,1,4]  // gcd=2\\nNow to get another 4, need to create it.\\nmove4:1,1→1,2 →[2,4,1]\\nmove5:1,2→1,3 →[3,4,1]\\nNot helping.\\nFrom [1,1,4], pick 1 and 4 → get 1,5 →[1,1,5]\\nOr pick two 1s → get 1,2 →[2,4,1]\\nThen pick 1 and 2 → get 1,3 →[3,4,1]\\nTo get a 4, we need to sum to 4.\\nFor example, pick 1 and 3 → get 1,4 → but we already have a 4? From [3,4,1], pick 1 and 3 → gcd=1 → get 1 and 4 → now [4,4,1]\\nYes!\\nSo moves:\\nAfter move3: [1,1,4], s=3,t=1+1+2=4? Moves: m1: gcd(1,1)=1, m2:gcd(1,1)=1, m3:gcd(2,2)=2, so t=4, s=3\\nmove4: pick 1 and 1? But only two 1s? [1,1,4], pick two 1s → gcd=1 → get 1 and 2 → [2,4,1] → s=4,t=5\\nmove5: pick 1 and 2 → gcd=1 → get 1 and 3 → [3,4,1] → s=5,t=6\\nmove6: pick 1 and 3 → gcd=1 → get 1 and 4 → [4,4,1] → s=6,t=7\\nNow move7: pick two 4s → gcd=4 → get 1 and 8 → s=7,t=7+4=11\\nSo ratio=11/7\\nThen additional c moves: s=7+c, t=11+c, ratio=(11+c)/(7+c)\\nNow, before the high gcd move (move7), s=6,t=7, not equal.\\nt0=7, m0=6, g=4, so after: s=7,t=11\\nThen after c more: s=7+c,t=11+c, ratio=(11+c)/(7+c)\\nWe can get ratios of the form (11+c)/(7+c) for c≥0\\nSimilarly, earlier with gcd=2: (4+c)/(3+c)\\ngcd=3: (7+c)/(5+c)\\nNote that (4+c)/(3+c) = 1 + 1/(3+c)\\n(7+c)/(5+c) = 1 + 2/(5+c)\\n(11+c)/(7+c) = 1 + 4/(7+c)\\nIn general, we can get ratios 1 + d/k for various d and k.\\nMoreover, by choosing different g and different setup, we can get different d.\\nBut more importantly, the set of all such ratios, as we vary the high gcd move and the number of trailing gcd=1 moves, gives us a dense set in [1,∞)?\\nBut we need all possible values, and since we can get ratios arbitrarily close to 1 from above, and also larger values.\\nBut can we get any rational >1?\\nFor example, 3/2=1.5\\nFrom earlier, with gcd=2 move and c=1: (4+1)/(3+1)=5/4=1.25<1.5\\nWith gcd=3: (7+c)/(5+c), set equal to 3/2: (7+c)/(5+c)=3/2 => 2(7+c)=3(5+c) =>14+2c=15+3c =>14-15=3c-2c => -1=c, not possible.\\ngcd=4: (11+c)/(7+c)=3/2? 2(11+c)=3(7+c) =>22+2c=21+3c =>22-21=3c-2c =>1=c\\nSo c=1: ratio=(11+1)/(7+1)=12/8=3/2\\nYes! So for n=3, after 7 moves to set up, then one more gcd=1 move: total s=8, t=12, ratio=12/8=3/2\\nWe had s=7,t=11 after move7, then move8: say pick 1 and 8 → gcd=1 → get 1 and 9 → s=8,t=12, yes.\\nSo achievable.\\nSimilarly, any rational p/q >1 can be written as (a+c)/(b+c) for some a,b,c, but in our case, a and b are determined by the setup.\\nBut notice that in the expression ratio = (t0 + g + c) / (m0 + 1 + c)\\nWhere t0, m0, g are fixed for a particular high gcd move sequence, and c≥0 integer.\\nAs c varies, this is a rational function, and takes values from (t0+g)/(m0+1) down to 1 as c→∞.\\nMoreover, since we can choose different high gcd moves, we get different starting points.\\nBut more importantly, the differences: the ratio is of the form (p + c)/(q + c) for some p,q depending on the sequence.\\nNow, (p+c)/(q+c) = 1 + (p-q)/(q+c)\\nSo it's 1 plus a constant over linear.\\nBut to get a specific rational r = a/b, we need to solve (p+c)/(q+c) = a/b for some integers p,q,c from our sequences.\\nBut since we can make c large, and p,q vary, likely the set is dense, but we need exact rationals.\\nNote that after any finite sequence, we have some s and t, and then we can do additional moves with gcd=1, which change the ratio to (t+c)/(s+c) for c=0,1,2,...\\nAnd (t+c)/(s+c) is a sequence decreasing to 1.\\nNow, the key point is that at any stage, the current ratio is some rational r0 = t/s, and by doing gcd=1 moves, we can achieve any rational of the form (t+c)/(s+c) for c≥0.\\nMoreover, we can reach different r0 by different sequences.\\nNow, what values of r0 can we achieve?\\nFor example, we can achieve r0=1 (by doing only gcd=1 moves)\\nr0=4/3 (as above)\\nr0=7/5, 11/7, etc.\\nAlso, we can do multiple high gcd moves.\\nFor example, after getting [1,1,4], we could instead of doing gcd=1 moves, do another high gcd setup.\\nBut importantly, the set of achievable ratios includes all values of the form (t+c)/(s+c) for any achievable (s,t) and c≥0.\\nNow, since we can achieve (s,t) = (3,4), (5,7), (7,11), etc., and also (1,1), (2,2), (4,4), etc.\\nBut more crucially, can we achieve any integer ratio? Or any rational?\\nSuppose we want ratio k, integer.\\nFor example, k=2.\\nIs it possible?\\nSuppose at some point we have s,m, t, and we do a move with very large gcd.\\nFor example, if we can make gcd=g large, then t increases by g, s by 1, so new ratio (t+g)/(s+1)\\nIf g is large, this can be large.\\nFor example, if we have two equal large numbers M, gcd=M, so if we pick them, t += M, s +=1\\nBefore that, s=s0, t=t0, after: s=s0+1, t=t0+M\\nRatio = (t0 + M)/(s0 + 1)\\nM can be large, so this can be arbitrarily large.\\nFor example, in n=3, can we make M large?\\nYes, by repeatedly building larger numbers.\\nFor instance, start:\\nMove1:1,1→1,2 →[1,1,2]\\nMove2:1,2→1,3 →[1,1,3]\\nMove3:1,1→1,2 →[2,3,1]\\nMove4:1,2→1,3 →[3,3,1]\\nMove5:3,3→1,6 →[1,1,6]  // gcd=3, t=1+1+1+1+3=7, s=5\\nNow M=6\\nBut we can continue: move6:1,1→1,2 →[2,6,1]\\nmove7:1,2→1,3 →[3,6,1]\\nmove8:1,3→1,4 →[4,6,1]\\n...\\nTo get another 6, hard.\\nFrom [1,1,6], we can do: move6: pick 1 and 6 → get 1,7 →[1,1,7]\\nNot helping.\\nTo get two large equal numbers, we need symmetry.\\nSuppose we want to create two copies of a large number.\\nFor example, use a balanced approach.\\nBut in any case, suppose we have a number M on the board, and we can create another M.\\nFor instance, the sum is n + m, so if M is large, say M > (n+m)/2, then only one number can be that large, so we cannot have two copies.\\nMaximum number is at most n + m.\\nTo have two numbers ≥ M, need 2M ≤ n + m.\\nWhen we pick them, gcd ≥1, but if they are equal, gcd=M, so M ≤ (n+m)/2\\nThen the ratio jump: from (t0,M0) to (t0+M, s0+1)\\nBut t0 ≤ s0 * G_max ≤ s0 * (n + s0) , but roughly, t0 is O(s0^2) or something, but M is O(s0), so (t0 + M)/(s0 +1) = O(s0), so can be large as s0 increases.\\nFor example, set s0 large, M large.\\nSpecifically, can we make M proportional to s0?\\nSuppose we focus on building large numbers.\\nFor example, always pick the two largest numbers, or something.\\nBut to simplify, suppose we can achieve a state where we have two numbers equal to M, with M ≈ c s for some c.\\nBut from 2M ≤ n + s, so M ≤ (n+s)/2\\nSo at best M ~ s/2\\nThen when we pick them, t += M ~ s/2, s +=1, so new t ~ t + s/2, new s ~ s+1\\nIf previously t was about k s, then new ratio ~ (k s + s/2)/(s+1) ≈ k + 1/2 for large s\\nBut we can repeat.\\nHowever, after picking, we have 1 and 2M, so we have a larger number.\\nThen we can try to build another large number.\\nBut it might be possible to make t grow quadratically.\\nFor example, each such high gcd move adds about s/2 to t, and s increases by 1, so the increment to t is proportional to s, so t grows like sum of s, which is quadratic.\\nSo t = Theta(s^2), so t/s = Theta(s) → ∞ as s→∞.\\nTherefore, t/s can be arbitrarily large.\\nMoreover, since we can also make it close to 1, and the set of achievable ratios includes intervals or dense sets.\\nBut more importantly, after any finite sequence, we have a ratio r = t/s, and then by doing additional gcd=1 moves, we can achieve (t+c)/(s+c) for all c≥0.\\nNow, (t+c)/(s+c) for c=0,1,2,... is a sequence of rationals decreasing from t/s to 1.\\nAnd the differences between consecutive terms go to 0.\\nMoreover, the set of all such sequences for different initial (t,s) might cover all rationals ≥1.\\nIn fact, it is known in such problems that the set of achievable ratios is all rational numbers greater than or equal to 1.\\nTo confirm, can we achieve 3/2? We did.\\n4/3? Yes.\\n5/3? 5/3≈1.666\\nSet (t+c)/(s+c) =5/3\\nSo 3(t+c)=5(s+c) => 3t +3c =5s +5c => 3t -5s =2c\\nSo c = (3t -5s)/2\\nNeed c≥0 integer.\\nSo need 3t -5s ≥0 and even.\\nFind a sequence with t,s such that 3t -5s is non-negative even integer.\\nFor example, earlier we had after move7: s=7,t=11, 3*11 -5*7=33-35=-2<0\\nAfter move5 with gcd=3: s=5,t=7, 3*7-5*5=21-25=-4<0\\nAfter move3 with gcd=2: s=3,t=4, 3*4-5*3=12-15=-3<0\\nAfter move1: s=1,t=1, 3-5=-2<0\\nAfter move2: s=2,t=2,6-10=-4<0\\nAfter move4: if we have s=4,t=4 (all gcd=1), 12-20=-8<0\\nOr after move5 in gcd=3 sequence: s=5,t=7,21-25=-4<0\\nAfter move6: s=6,t=7 (before move7), 21-30=-9<0\\nAfter move7: s=7,t=11,33-35=-2<0\\nAfter move8: s=8,t=12,36-40=-4<0\\nNot working.\\nTry a different sequence.\\nSuppose we do more high gcd moves.\\nFor example, after [1,1,6], instead of doing gcd=1, try to build another 6.\\nFrom [1,1,6], pick 1 and 1 → get 1,2 → [2,6,1]\\nPick 1 and 2 → get 1,3 → [3,6,1]\\nPick 1 and 3 → get 1,4 → [4,6,1]\\nPick 1 and 4 → get 1,5 → [5,6,1]\\nPick 1 and 5 → get 1,6 → [6,6,1]\\nNow we have two 6s.\\nMoves: from [1,1,6] (after move5, s=5,t=7)\\nmove6: pick two 1s? But only two 1s? [1,1,6], pick a=1,b=1,gcd=1 → get 1 and 2 → [2,6,1] → s=6,t=8\\nmove7: pick 1 and 2 → gcd=1 → get 1 and 3 → [3,6,1] → s=7,t=9\\nmove8: pick 1 and 3 → gcd=1 → get 1 and 4 → [4,6,1] → s=8,t=10\\nmove9: pick 1 and 4 → gcd=1 → get 1 and 5 → [5,6,1] → s=9,t=11\\nmove10: pick 1 and 5 → gcd=1 → get 1 and 6 → [6,6,1] → s=10,t=12\\nNow move11: pick two 6s → gcd=6 → get 1 and 12 → s=11,t=12+6=18\\nSo ratio=18/11≈1.636\\nThen additional c moves: s=11+c, t=18+c, ratio=(18+c)/(11+c)\\nSet equal to 5/3: (18+c)/(11+c)=5/3 => 3(18+c)=5(11+c) =>54+3c=55+5c =>54-55=5c-3c => -1=2c, not possible.\\nBut 18/11≈1.636, 5/3≈1.666, close.\\nCan we get a higher ratio?\\nAfter move11: s=11,t=18\\nDo move12: pick 1 and 12 → gcd=1 → get 1 and 13 → s=12,t=19\\nRatio=19/12≈1.583\\nLower.\\nTo get a larger gcd, need larger equal numbers.\\nSuppose after having [6,6,1], instead of combining, we could build larger, but we combined.\\nOr, after [1,1,12], we can repeat the process to build two 12s, but it will take many moves.\\nEventually, we can get very large gcd.\\nFor example, to get two 12s, from [1,1,12], we need to create another 12 by summing 1s, but it will take 11 moves of adding 1 to current number, each time increasing by 1, but with gcd=1.\\nFrom [1,1,12], pick 1 and 1 → get 1,2 → [2,12,1]\\nThen pick 1 and 2 → get 1,3 → [3,12,1]\\n...\\nAfter 11 such moves, we get to [12,12,1], and during these 11 moves, each has gcd=1, so t increases by 11, s by 11.\\nSuppose before this, after move11: s=11,t=18\\nThen after 11 more moves: s=22, t=18+11=29\\nThen move23: pick two 12s → gcd=12 → get 1 and 24 → s=23, t=29+12=41\\nRatio=41/23≈1.782\\nThen (41+c)/(23+c)\\nSet to 5/3: (41+c)/(23+c)=5/3 => 3(41+c)=5(23+c) =>123+3c=115+5c =>123-115=5c-3c =>8=2c =>c=4\\nSo after 4 more gcd=1 moves: s=23+4=27, t=41+4=45, ratio=45/27=5/3\\nYes! So achievable.\\nSimilarly, any rational p/q >1 can be achieved by first reaching a state with large t and s via a high gcd move, then doing c gcd=1 moves to hit exactly p/q.\\nMoreover, for rationals equal to 1, we can achieve by doing only gcd=1 moves.\\nTherefore, for any fixed n≥3, the set of possible ratios t/s is all rational numbers greater than or equal to 1.\\nBut is that correct? In the construction, we assumed we can perform the moves, which we can for n≥3.\\nAlso, s and t are positive integers, as required.\\nSo answer should be all rational numbers ≥1.\\nBut the problem asks for \"all possible values\", and to list them.\\nIn competition problems, sometimes it's an interval or a set.\\nBut here, since it's a ratio, and we can achieve any rational ≥1, and only those (since t/s ≥1 always, as gcd≥1, so t≥s), so the set is all rational numbers greater than or equal to 1.\\nBut typically, answers are given as a set.\\nPerhaps they want the set.\\nBut in the format, we need to put a string.\\nLooking back at Problem 1, we have a numerical answer.\\nFor Problem 2, likely a description.\\nPerhaps \"all rational numbers at least 1\" or something.\\nBut to be precise.\\nAnother thought: is it possible to achieve irrational ratios? No, because s and t are integers, so t/s is rational.\\nAnd we can achieve any rational ≥1, as shown by the constructions.\\nTherefore, the set of possible values is all rational numbers greater than or equal to 1.\\nSo answer_2 = \"all rational numbers greater than or equal to 1\"\\n\\nBut let's confirm with the initial condition.\\nIn the move, we add gcd(a,b) stones to second bucket, and 1 to first, so t is sum of gcds, s is number of moves, so t ≥ s, since each gcd ≥1, so t/s ≥1, and rational, and we can achieve any such rational, as demonstrated.\\n\\nThus, final answers.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"all rational numbers greater than or equal to 1\"\n}",
