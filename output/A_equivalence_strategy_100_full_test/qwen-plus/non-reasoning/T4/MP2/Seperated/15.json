      "A3384": "One day, there is a Street Art Show at somewhere, and there are some spectators around. We consider this place as an Euclidean plane. Let $K$ be the center of the show. And name the spectators by $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}, \\ldots$ They pick their positions $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}, \\ldots$ one by one. The positions need to satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously. (i) The distance between $K$ and $A_{n}$ is no less than 10 meters, that is, $K P_{n} \\geq 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any positive integer $n$. (ii) The distance between $A_{n}$ and any previous spectator is no less than 1 meter, that is, $P_{m} P_{n} \\geq 1 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any $n \\geq 2$ and any $1 \\leq m \\leq n-1$. (iii) $A_{n}$ always choose the position closest to $K$ that satisfies (i) and (ii), that is, $K P_{n}$ reaches its minimum possible value. If there are more than one point that satisfy (i) and (ii) and have the minimum distance to $K, A_{n}$ may choose any one of them. For example, $A_{1}$ is not restricted by (ii), so he may choose any point on the circle $C$ which is centered at $K$ with radius 10 meters. For $A_{2}$, since there are lots of points on $C$ which are at least 1 meter apart from $P_{1}$, he may choose anyone of them. (1) Which of the following statement is true? (A) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2}$ always hold (unit: meter); (B) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\sqrt{n} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} \\sqrt{n}$ always hold (unit: meter); (C) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n$ always hold (unit: meter); (D) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n^{2} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n^{2}$ always hold (unit: meter)."

Without loss of generality, assume it's placed at distance 10.\\n\\nA2 wants to be as close to K as possible, but at least 1m from A1. The optimal position is on the circle of radius 10, 1m away from A1 along the circumference. But since they can choose any such point, they will pick one on the circle (same radius).\\n\\nAs more people arrive, they will pack as tightly as possible around K, forming a sort of circular packing.\\n\\nThis is similar to circle packing in an annulus. The number of points that can be placed on a circle of radius r with minimum angular separation corresponding to chord length ≥1m is roughly proportional to r (since circumference is 2πr, and each person takes up about 1m of arc length if packed closely).\\n\\nTo fit n people, the circumference needed is at least n * 1m (if packed optimally). So the radius r must satisfy 2πr ≈ n => r ≈ n / (2π)\\n\\nBut wait: they are not constrained to a single circle. They can form concentric rings.\\n\\nIn 2D, the area required per person is at least that of a circle of diameter 1m, i.e., area ~ π(0.5)^2 = π/4. So to fit n people, total area needed is ~ n * π/4.\\n\\nThe area within radius R is πR^2. So we need πR^2 ≥ c*n => R ≥ sqrt(c*n) => R ~ sqrt(n)\\n\\nThus, KP_n grows like sqrt(n). Moreover, because each person minimizes their distance to K, the configuration will fill inwards as much as possible, so the outermost person is at distance ~ sqrt(n).\\n\\nTherefore, KP_n is asymptotically proportional to sqrt(n).\\n\\nSo statement (B) is correct: there exist c1, c2 > 0 such that c1*sqrt(n) ≤ KP_n ≤ c2*sqrt(n) for all n.\\n\\n(A) is false because KP_n → ∞ as n → ∞.\\n(C) and (D) grow too fast — linear and quadratic — while the geometry suggests sqrt(n) scaling.\\n\\nHence, answer is (B).\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"7\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"B\"\n}",
