We are to find $k = f(0) + 1$, where $f(0)$ is the value of any function satisfying this equation at 0.\\n\\nStep 1: Plug in $x = 0$, $y = 0$.\\n\\nLeft-hand side:\\n$$\\nf(0^3 + 0^3 + 0\\\\cdot0) = f(0)\\n$$\\n\\nRight-hand side:\\n$$\\n0^2 f(0) + 0^2 f(0) + f(0) = f(0)\\n$$\\n\\nSo the equation becomes $f(0) = f(0)$, which gives no new information.\\n\\nStep 2: Let $y = 0$, and keep $x$ arbitrary.\\n\\nThen the equation becomes:\\n\\nLeft-hand side:\\n$$\\nf(x^3 + 0^3 + x\\\\cdot0) = f(x^3)\\n$$\\n\\nRight-hand side:\\n$$\\nx^2 f(x) + 0^2 f(0) + f(0) = x^2 f(x) + f(0)\\n$$\\n\\nSo we have:\\n$$\\nf(x^3) = x^2 f(x) + f(0) \\\\quad \\\\text{(1)}\\n$$\\n\\nStep 3: Now let $x = 0$, $y$ arbitrary.\\n\\nLeft-hand side:\\n$$\\nf(0 + y^3 + 0) = f(y^3)\\n$$\\n\\nRight-hand side:\\n$$\\n0 + y^2 f(y) + f(0)\\n$$\\n\\nSo:\\n$$\\nf(y^3) = y^2 f(y) + f(0) \\\\quad \\\\text{(2)}\\n$$\\n\\nThis is consistent with (1), so nothing new yet.\\n\\nStep 4: Use symmetry. From (1) and (2), both give the same expression.\\n\\nNow consider setting $y = -x$.\\n\\nLet’s compute both sides when $y = -x$.\\n\\nLeft-hand side:\\n$$\\nx^3 + (-x)^3 + x(-x) = x^3 - x^3 - x^2 = -x^2\\n$$\\nSo:\\n$$\\nf(-x^2) = ?\\n$$\\n\\nRight-hand side:\\n$$\\nx^2 f(x) + (-x)^2 f(-x) + f(x \\\\cdot (-x)) = x^2 f(x) + x^2 f(-x) + f(-x^2)\\n$$\\n\\nSo the equation becomes:\\n$$\\nf(-x^2) = x^2 f(x) + x^2 f(-x) + f(-x^2)\\n$$\\n\\nSubtract $f(-x^2)$ from both sides:\\n$$\\n0 = x^2 f(x) + x^2 f(-x)\\n$$\\n\\nAssuming $x \\\\ne 0$, divide by $x^2$:\\n$$\\nf(x) + f(-x) = 0\\n$$\\nSo $f$ is an odd function:\\n$$\\nf(-x) = -f(x)\\n$$\\n\\nStep 5: Recall from earlier:\\n$$\\nf(x^3) = x^2 f(x) + f(0)\\n$$\\n\\nNow replace $x$ with $-x$:\\n$$\\nf((-x)^3) = (-x)^2 f(-x) + f(0) \\\\Rightarrow f(-x^3) = x^2 (-f(x)) + f(0) = -x^2 f(x) + f(0)\\n$$\\n\\nBut since $f$ is odd:\\n$$\\nf(-x^3) = -f(x^3)\\n$$\\n\\nFrom original: $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x) + f(0)$, so $-f(x^3) = -x^2 f(x) - f(0)$\\n\\nBut we also have $f(-x^3) = -x^2 f(x) + f(0)$\\n\\nSo set them equal:\\n$$\\n-x^2 f(x) - f(0) = -x^2 f(x) + f(0)\\n$$\\n\\nSubtract $-x^2 f(x)$ from both sides:\\n$$\\n-f(0) = f(0) \\\\Rightarrow 2f(0) = 0 \\\\Rightarrow f(0) = 0\\n$$\\n\\nTherefore, $k = f(0) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 1 is $k = 1$\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe need a sequence of non-zero integers (maximal length) such that:\\n- The sum of any 7 consecutive terms is positive.\\n- The sum of any 11 consecutive terms is negative.\\n\\nLet the sequence be $a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$, each $a_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\setminus \\\\{0\\\\}$.\\n\\nLet $S_k = a_k + a_{k+1} + \\\\cdots + a_{k+6}$ > 0 for all $k$ such that $k+6 \\\\leq n$.\\nSimilarly, $T_k = a_k + \\\\cdots + a_{k+10} < 0$ for all $k$ such that $k+10 \\\\leq n$.\\n\\nWe want the maximal possible $n$.\\n\\nLet’s suppose the sequence has length $n$. Then:\\n- There are $n - 6$ overlapping 7-term sums, each positive.\\n- There are $n - 10$ overlapping 11-term sums, each negative.\\n\\nWe use a standard trick from olympiad problems: double counting using overlapping sums.\\n\\nLet’s define $s = a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_n$\\n\\nIdea: Consider summing all the 7-consecutive sums.\\nEach term $a_i$ appears in as many 7-sums as the number of windows containing it.\\nFor position $i$, it appears in $\\\\min(i, 7, n-i+1, n-6)$ — more precisely, the number of 7-tuples covering $a_i$ is:\\n$$\\n\\\\text{number of } k \\\\text{ such that } k \\\\leq i \\\\leq k+6 \\\\Rightarrow i-6 \\\\leq k \\\\leq i, \\\\text{ and } 1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n-6\\n$$\\nSo $k$ ranges from $\\\\max(1, i-6)$ to $\\\\min(n-6, i)$\\nSo count is $\\\\min(n-6, i) - \\\\max(1, i-6) + 1$\\n\\nBut instead of computing exactly, use a known inequality technique.\\n\\nLet’s suppose $n \\\\geq 17$. We will show contradiction.\\n\\nConsider the sum of all 7-consecutive sums:\\nThere are $n - 6$ such sums, each > 0, so total sum $> 0$.\\n\\nEach $a_i$ appears in exactly $\\\\min(i, 7, n-i+1, 7)$? Wait — better: the number of 7-tuples covering $a_i$ is:\\n- For $i = 1$: only one window: positions 1–7 → count = 1\\n- For $i = 2$: still in 1–7, 2–8? Only if $n \\\\geq 8$\\nActually, for general $i$, the number of 7-consecutive blocks containing $a_i$ is:\\n$$\\n\\\\min(i, 7, n - i + 1, n - 6)?\\n$$\\nNo — correct formula: the number of starting indices $k$ such that $k \\\\leq i \\\\leq k+6$ and $1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n-6$\\nSo $k \\\\geq i - 6$, $k \\\\leq i$, and $k \\\\geq 1$, $k \\\\leq n - 6$\\nSo $k \\\\in [\\\\max(1, i-6), \\\\min(n-6, i)]$\\nLength: $\\\\min(n-6, i) - \\\\max(1, i-6) + 1$\\n\\nThis is symmetric and increases then decreases.\\nBut instead, note that for $7 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n-6$, $a_i$ appears in exactly 7 different 7-sums (since $k$ from $i-6$ to $i$, but constrained by $1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n-6$, and if $i \\\\geq 7$ and $i \\\\leq n-6$, then $i-6 \\\\geq 1$, $i \\\\leq n-6$, so $k$ from $i-6$ to $i$ → 7 values).\\nSimilarly, near ends, less.\\n\\nBut we can bound.\\n\\nTotal sum of all 7-sums:\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-6} S_k > 0\\n$$\\nand this equals:\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i a_i\\n$$\\nwhere $c_i$ is the number of 7-sums containing $a_i$, which is:\\n- $c_i = i$ for $i = 1$ to $7$\\n- $c_i = 7$ for $i = 7$ to $n-6$\\n- $c_i = n - i + 1$ for $i = n-5$ to $n$\\nWait, correction:\\nFor $i \\\\leq 7$: $\\\\max(1, i-6) = 1$, $\\\\min(n-6, i) = i$ → count = $i - 1 + 1 = i$\\nFor $i \\\\geq n-5$: $\\\\max(1, i-6)$, $\\\\min(n-6, i) = n-6$, so count = $(n-6) - \\\\max(1, i-6) + 1$\\nIf $i \\\\geq n-5$, and assuming $n-5 \\\\geq 7$ or not?\\nBetter: for $i$ from 1 to 6: $c_i = i$\\nFor $i$ from 7 to $n-6$: $c_i = 7$\\nFor $i$ from $n-5$ to $n$: $c_i = n - i + 1$\\nBecause:\\n- When $i \\\\geq n-5$, then $\\\\min(n-6, i) = n-6$, $\\\\max(1, i-6)$: if $i-6 \\\\geq 1$, which is true for $i \\\\geq 7$, so for $i \\\\geq \\\\max(7, n-5)$, $c_i = (n-6) - (i-6) + 1 = n - i + 1$\\nAnd for $i = n-5$: $n - (n-5) + 1 = 6$, $i = n-4$: 5, ..., $i = n$: 1\\n\\nSo yes.\\n\\nSimilarly, for the 11-sums: each sum $< 0$, there are $n - 10$ of them.\\nSum of all 11-consecutive sums:\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-10} T_k < 0\\n$$\\nThis equals $\\\\sum_{i=1}^n d_i a_i$, where $d_i$ is number of 11-sums containing $a_i$:\\n- $d_i = i$ for $i = 1$ to $10$\\n- $d_i = 11$ for $i = 11$ to $n-10$\\n- $d_i = n - i + 1$ for $i = n-9$ to $n$\\n\\nNow, we want to get a contradiction for large $n$.\\n\\nSuppose $n \\\\geq 17$. Then the middle region exists.\\n\\nLet us try to find the maximum possible $n$.\\n\\nKnown result: In such problems (sum of every m consecutive is positive, every n consecutive is negative), the maximal length is $m + n - \\\\gcd(m,n) - 1$ or something? But let's think.\\n\\nAlternatively, assume such a sequence of length $n$ exists.\\n\\nLet $A = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-6} S_k > 0$\\n$B = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-10} T_k < 0$\\n\\nNow express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $a_i$.\\n\\nWe can try to eliminate.\\n\\nBut perhaps easier: suppose $n = 17$.\\n\\nThen:\\n- Number of 7-sums: $17 - 6 = 11$, each > 0 → sum $A > 0$\\n- Number of 11-sums: $17 - 10 = 7$, each < 0 → sum $B < 0$\\n\\nNow compute $A = \\\\sum c_i a_i$, $c_i$ as above.\\nFor $n = 17$:\\n- $c_i = i$ for $i=1$ to $6$\\n- $c_i = 7$ for $i=7$ to $11$ (since $n-6 = 11$)\\n- $c_i = n - i + 1 = 18 - i$ for $i=12$ to $17$\\nSo:\\ni: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17\\n c:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 7  7  7  6  5  4  3  2  1\\n\\nSimilarly, $d_i$ for 11-sums:\\n- $d_i = i$ for $i=1$ to $10$\\n- $d_i = 11$ for $i=11$ to $7$? $n-10 = 7$, so middle from $i=11$ to $i=7$? No: $i$ from 11 to $n-10 = 7$? That would be empty if $11 > 7$.\\n$n = 17$, $n-10 = 7$, so middle condition: $i$ from 11 to $7$ → impossible. So no middle constant part.\\nActually: $d_i = \\\\min(i, 11, n-i+1, n-10)$?\\nCorrect: $d_i = \\\\min(i, 11, n-i+1, n-10)$ no.\\nFrom earlier:\\n$d_i =$\\n- $i$ for $i = 1$ to $10$\\n- $11$ for $i = 11$ to $n-10 = 7$ → but $11 > 7$, so this interval is empty\\n- $n - i + 1$ for $i = n-9 = 8$ to $17$\\nSo for $i = 8$ to $17$: $d_i = 18 - i$\\nBut also for $i = 1$ to $10$: $d_i = i$\\nSo overlap: for $i = 8,9,10$: defined twice?\\nConflict.\\nActually, the three regions:\\n- Left: $i \\\\leq 10$: $d_i = i$\\n- Middle: $11 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n-10 = 7$: empty\\n- Right: $i \\\\geq n-9 = 8$: $d_i = n - i + 1 = 18 - i$\\nSo for $i = 8,9,10$: both definitions? Which one?\\nNeed to use the formula:\\n$d_i = \\\\min(n-10, i) - \\\\max(1, i-10) + 1$\\nFor $i=8$:\\n$\\\\max(1, 8-10)=\\\\max(1,-2)=1$\\n$\\\\min(7,8)=7$\\nSo $d_8 = 7 - 1 + 1 = 7$\\nBut left rule says $i=8$, should be 8? No, the 'left' rule $d_i=i$ only holds when $i \\\\leq 10$ AND $i \\\\leq n-10$? No.\\nRecall:\\nThe count is $\\\\min(n-10, i) - \\\\max(1, i-10) + 1$\\nFor $i \\\\leq 10$: $\\\\max(1,i-10)=1$ (since $i-10 \\\\leq 0$)\\n$\\\\min(n-10, i) = \\\\min(7,i)$\\nSo for $i=1$: $\\\\min(7,1)=1$, $\\\\max=1$, count=1-1+1=1 → ok\\n$i=2$: min(7,2)=2, max=1, count=2-1+1=2 → ok\\n...\\n$i=7$: min(7,7)=7, max=1, count=7-1+1=7\\n$i=8$: min(7,8)=7, max(1,-2)=1, count=7-1+1=7\\n$i=9$: min(7,9)=7, max(1,-1)=1, count=7\\n$i=10$: min(7,10)=7, max(1,0)=1, count=7\\n$i=11$: min(7,11)=7, max(1,1)=1, count=7\\nWait, $\\\\max(1,11-10)=\\\\max(1,1)=1$\\nSo $d_i = 7 - 1 + 1 = 7$ for $i=11$?\\nBut $i=12$: $\\\\min(7,12)=7$, $\\\\max(1,2)=2$, count=7-2+1=6\\n$i=13$: min=7, max(1,3)=3, count=7-3+1=5\\n...\\n$i=17$: min=7, max(1,7)=7, count=7-7+1=1\\nSo actually for $n=17$, $d_i$ is:\\ni: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17\\n d:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 7  7  7  6  5  4  3  2  1\\n\\nInteresting! Same as $c_i$!\\nFor $n=17$, both coefficient sequences are identical:\\nc: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]\\nd: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]\\nSo $A = \\\\sum c_i a_i > 0$, $B = \\\\sum d_i a_i = \\\\sum c_i a_i < 0$\\nContradiction! Because $A = B$, but $A > 0$, $B < 0$ impossible.\\n\\nTherefore, no such sequence of length 17.\\n\\nNow try $n = 16$.\\nCheck if possible.\\nFirst, check if the coefficient sequences can avoid contradiction.\\nFor $n=16$:\\nNumber of 7-sums: $16-6=10$\\nEach >0 → sum $A = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{10} S_k > 0$\\n$c_i$: number of 7-sums containing $a_i$\\n- $i=1$ to $6$: $c_i = i$\\n- $i=7$ to $n-6=10$: $c_i=7$\\n- $i=n-5=11$ to $16$: $c_i = n-i+1 = 17-i$\\nSo:\\ni: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\\n c:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 7 7   6   5   4   3   2   1\\n\\nNow 11-sums: number = $16-10=6$\\n$d_i = \\\\min(6, i) - \\\\max(1, i-10) + 1$\\nCompute:\\ni=1: min(6,1)=1, max(1,-9)=1, d=1-1+1=1\\ni=2: min=2, max=1, d=2-1+1=2\\n...\\ni=6: min=6, max=1, d=6-1+1=6\\ni=7: min(6,7)=6, max(1,-3)=1, d=6-1+1=6\\ni=8: min=6, max(1,-2)=1, d=6\\ni=9: min=6, max(1,-1)=1, d=6\\ni=10: min=6, max(1,0)=1, d=6\\ni=11: min=6, max(1,1)=1, d=6-1+1=6\\ni=12: min=6, max(1,2)=2, d=6-2+1=5\\ni=13: min=6, max(1,3)=3, d=6-3+1=4\\ni=14: min=6, max(1,4)=4, d=6-4+1=3\\ni=15: min=6, max(1,5)=5, d=6-5+1=2\\ni=16: min=6, max(1,6)=6, d=6-6+1=1\\nSo d: [1,2,3,4,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,4,3,2,1]\\n\\nNow $A = \\\\sum c_i a_i > 0$\\n$B = \\\\sum d_i a_i < 0$\\nAre these compatible? Possibly, since coefficients differ.\\nBut we need to see if such a sequence exists.\\n\\nTry to construct.\\nIdea: make the sequence periodic or alternating.\\nSince sum of 7 consecutive is positive, 11 is negative, perhaps use a repeating pattern with period related to gcd(7,11)=1, but maybe short period.\\n\\nTry a constant sequence? But then sum of 7 is 7a, sum of 11 is 11a; cannot have 7a>0 and 11a<0.\\n\\nTry alternating: say $a, b, a, b, ...$\\nBut non-zero integers.\\nLet’s suppose period 2: $x, y, x, y, ...$\\nThen sum of 7 consecutive: depends on start.\\nIf starts with x: positions: x,y,x,y,x,y,x → 4x+3y\\nIf starts with y: y,x,y,x,y,x,y → 4y+3x\\nBoth must be >0\\nSum of 11 consecutive: 6 of one, 5 of other?\\n11 is odd, so if start with x: 6x+5y\\nStart with y: 6y+5x\\nMust be <0\\nSo we need:\\n4x+3y >0\\n3x+4y >0  (if start with y, but wait: 4y+3x = 3x+4y)\\n6x+5y <0\\n5x+6y <0\\nCan we find integers x,y ≠0 satisfying?\\nSet u = x+y, v = x−y, or just solve inequalities.\\nFrom 4x+3y>0 and 6x+5y<0\\nMultiply first by 5: 20x+15y>0\\nSecond by 3: 18x+15y<0\\nSubtract: (20x+15y) - (18x+15y) = 2x >0 ⇒ x>0\\nSimilarly, from 3x+4y>0 and 5x+6y<0\\nMultiply first by 6: 18x+24y>0\\nSecond by 4: 20x+24y<0\\nSubtract: (18x+24y) - (20x+24y) = -2x >0 ⇒ x<0\\nContradiction.\\nSo no period 2.\\n\\nTry period 3? Might be messy.\\n\\nBack to maximal length.\\nWe saw that $n=17$ is impossible due to coefficient conflict.\\nWhat about $n=16$? Is it possible?\\n\\nWe can try to see if $n=16$ leads to contradiction via inequalities.\\nBut perhaps it is possible.\\nAnother idea: use the fact that the sum conditions imply bounds on partial sums.\\nLet $s_k = a_1 + \\\\cdots + a_k$\\nThen sum from $i$ to $j$ is $s_j - s_{i-1}$\\nSum of 7 consecutive starting at $k$: $s_{k+6} - s_{k-1} > 0$\\nSo $s_{k+6} > s_{k-1}$ for $k=1$ to $n-6$\\nSimilarly, sum of 11 consecutive: $s_{k+10} - s_{k-1} < 0$ ⇒ $s_{k+10} < s_{k-1}$ for $k=1$ to $n-10$\\n\\nSet $t_k = s_k$, the partial sum.\\nThen:\\nFor $k=1$ to $n-6$: $t_{k+6} > t_{k-1}$  (with $t_0 = 0$)\\nFor $k=1$ to $n-10$: $t_{k+10} < t_{k-1}$\\n\\nNow, this creates a chain of inequalities.\\n\\nSuppose $n=16$.\\nThen:\\nInequalities from 7-sums ($k=1$ to $10$):\\n$t_{7} > t_{0} = 0$\\n$t_{8} > t_{1}$\\n$t_{9} > t_{2}$\\n$t_{10} > t_{3}$\\n$t_{11} > t_{4}$\\n$t_{12} > t_{5}$\\n$t_{13} > t_{6}$\\n$t_{14} > t_{7}$\\n$t_{15} > t_{8}$\\n$t_{16} > t_{9}$\\n\\nFrom 11-sums ($k=1$ to $6$):\\n$t_{11} < t_{0} = 0$\\n$t_{12} < t_{1}$\\n$t_{13} < t_{2}$\\n$t_{14} < t_{3}$\\n$t_{15} < t_{4}$\\n$t_{16} < t_{5}$\\n\\nNow combine:\\nFrom 7-sum: $t_7 > 0$\\nFrom 11-sum: $t_{11} < 0$\\nBut from 7-sum: $t_{11} > t_4$\\nSo $t_4 < t_{11} < 0$\\nSimilarly, $t_7 > 0$, and $t_{14} > t_7 > 0$, but from 11-sum: $t_{14} < t_3$\\nSo $t_3 > t_{14} > 0$\\nAlso $t_{15} > t_8$, and $t_{15} < t_4 < 0$, so $t_8 < t_{15} < 0$\\nSimilarly, $t_{16} > t_9$, $t_{16} < t_5$, so $t_9 < t_{16} < t_5$\\nAlso $t_{12} > t_5$, $t_{12} < t_1$, so $t_5 < t_{12} < t_1$\\nAnd $t_{13} > t_6$, $t_{13} < t_2$, so $t_6 < t_{13} < t_2$\\n\\nNow, $t_4 < 0$, $t_3 > 0$, etc.\\nBut no immediate contradiction.\\n\\nPerhaps try to build such a sequence.\\nIdea: make early terms positive, later terms negative, but adjust so that any 7 consecutive have more positives, but 11 have more negatives.\\nSuppose we try a sequence with first few positive, last few negative.\\nBut need all terms non-zero integers.\\n\\nKnown result: the maximal length is $7 + 11 - 1 = 17$, but we saw 17 is impossible.\\nActually, in such problems, the maximal length is $m + n - \\\\gcd(m,n) - 1$?\\nHere $m=7$, $n=11$, $\\\\gcd=1$, so $7+11-1-1=16$?\\nOr sometimes $m+n-2$?\\nI recall a problem: sum of every 3 consecutive is positive, every 5 consecutive negative, max length 7.\\n3+5-1=7, but 7 might be too big.\\nAnyway.\\n\\nAfter research in mind, I recall that the maximal length is $m + n - \\\\gcd(m,n) - 1$ is not standard.\\nStandard bound: if sum of every m consecutive is positive, every n consecutive is negative, and $\\\\gcd(m,n)=d$, then the sequence can have length at most $m+n-d-1$? Not sure.\\n\\nBut in our case, $m=7$, $n=11$, coprime, so perhaps $7+11-2=16$.\\nAnd we saw 17 impossible, so 16 might be achievable.\\n\\nTry to construct for $n=16$.\\nLet me attempt.\\nLet the sequence be $a_1$ to $a_{16}$.\\nWe need:\\n- Each 7 consecutive sum >0\\n- Each 11 consecutive sum <0\\n\\nAssume symmetry? Or try constant magnitude.\\nSuppose all $|a_i|=1$, but then sum of 7 ones is 7>0, good, but sum of 11 ones is 11>0, not <0. If mostly -1, then 7-sum might be negative.\\nSo need mixture.\\n\\nLet me try to set most terms to 1, but some -1 to make 11-sum negative.\\nBut 11 consecutive include 11 terms; to make sum negative, need at least 6 negative terms in any 11 consecutive.\\nBut 7 consecutive must have sum >0, so at most 3 negative terms in any 7 consecutive.\\nIs this possible?\\nThis is a combinatorial constraint.\\nLet $b_i = 1$ if $a_i=1$, $-1$ if $a_i=-1$. But we can scale, but since integers, and non-zero, we can assume $\\\\pm1$ for simplicity, then scale if needed, but sum sign preserved.\\nBut if we use only $\\\\pm1$, then sum of 7 consecutive >0 means at least 4 ones (since 4-3=1>0), so at most 3 negative terms.\\nSum of 11 consecutive <0 means at most 5 ones, so at least 6 negative terms.\\nSo in any 11 consecutive, at least 6 negative terms.\\nIn any 7 consecutive, at most 3 negative terms.\\nNow, is there a binary sequence of length 16 with this?\\nLet $n_i$ be indicator of negative term.\\nThen:\\n- Every 7 consecutive contain at most 3 ones in $n_i$\\n- Every 11 consecutive contain at least 6 ones in $n_i$\\n\\nBut “at most 3 in 7” and “at least 6 in 11” — but 6 in 11 is high density.\\nSuppose we have such a sequence.\\nConsider the total number of negative terms, say $N$.\\nBy averaging over 7-windows: each 7-window has ≤3 negatives, there are $16-6=10$ windows, each negative term counted in multiple windows.\\nAs before, the sum of the counts is $\\\\sum c_i n_i$, with $c_i$ as before for $n=16$: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,7,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]\\nSum of $c_i$ = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+7+7+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = let's compute:\\n1+2+3+4+5+6=21, +7*4=28, total 49, +6+5+4+3+2+1=21, total 70? Wait no: indices 1 to 16:\\nc:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,7,7,6,5,4,3,2,1\\nSum: (1+2+3+4+5+6) = 21\\n(7+7+7+7) = 28\\n(6+5+4+3+2+1) = 21\\nTotal 21+28+21=70\\nEach window sum of $n_i$ over 7 terms ≤3, 10 windows, so sum of window sums ≤ 30\\nBut sum of window sums = $\\\\sum c_i n_i$ ≤ 30\\nBut $\\\\sum c_i n_i \\\\geq \\\\min c_i \\\\times N$, but better: since $c_i \\\\geq 1$, but we have lower bound issue.\\nActually, $\\\\sum c_i n_i \\\\leq 30$\\nBut $c_i$ are larger in the middle, so to minimize $N$, but we want to see if possible.\\nSimilarly, for 11-windows: each has ≥6 negatives, 6 windows (k=1 to 6), so sum of window sums ≥ 6*6=36\\nSum of window sums = $\\\\sum d_i n_i$, with $d_i$ for 11-sums: earlier for n=16, d: [1,2,3,4,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,4,3,2,1]\\nSum d_i = 1+2+3+4+5+6+6+6+6+6+6+5+4+3+2+1 = \\n(1+2+3+4+5+6)=21\\n(6*6)=36? Positions 7 to 12: six 6's? i=7,8,9,10,11,12: d_i=6,6,6,6,6,5?
