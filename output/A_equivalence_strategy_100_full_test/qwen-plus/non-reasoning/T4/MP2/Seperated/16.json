So no new information, but consistent.\\n\\nStep 2: Plug in $ x = 0 $:\\n\\n$$\\nf(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)|. \\\\tag{1}\\n$$\\n\\nThis gives us an expression for $ f(y^2) $ in terms of $ f(0) $ and $ y f(y) $.\\n\\nStep 3: Use symmetry — consider $ y $ and $ -y $.\\n\\nFrom (1),\\n\\n$$\\nf(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)|,\\n$$\\n$$\\nf((-y)^2) = f(0) + |-y f(-y)| = f(0) + |y f(-y)|.\\n$$\\n\\nBut $ y^2 = (-y)^2 $, so $ f(y^2) = f((-y)^2) $, hence:\\n\\n$$\\nf(0) + |y f(y)| = f(0) + |y f(-y)| \\\\Rightarrow |y f(y)| = |y f(-y)|.\\n$$\\n\\nFor $ y \\\\ne 0 $, divide both sides by $ |y| $:\\n\\n$$\\n|f(y)| = |f(-y)|.\\n$$\\n\\nSo $ f $ is even in absolute value.\\n\\nStep 4: Try to find $ f(0) $. Set $ x = -y^2 $ in the original equation:\\n\\n$$\\nf(-y^2 + y^2) = f(-y^2) + |y f(y)| \\\\Rightarrow f(0) = f(-y^2) + |y f(y)|. \\\\tag{2}\\n$$\\n\\nBut from earlier, equation (1): $ f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)| $.\\n\\nSo now we have:\\n\\n- $ f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)| $\\n- $ f(0) = f(-y^2) + |y f(y)| $\\n\\nSubtract or compare:\\n\\nFrom second: $ f(-y^2) = f(0) - |y f(y)| $.\\n\\nBut $ y^2 \\\\geq 0 $, so let $ z = y^2 \\\\geq 0 $, then for any $ z \\\\geq 0 $, we can write:\\n\\n$$\\nf(z) = f(0) + |y f(y)|,\\\\quad \\\\text{where } y = \\\\sqrt{z},\\n$$\\nand\\n$$\\nf(-z) = f(0) - |y f(y)| = f(0) - (f(z) - f(0)) = 2f(0) - f(z).\\n$$\\n\\nSo we get:\\n\\n$$\\nf(-z) = 2f(0) - f(z) \\\\quad \\\\text{for all } z \\\\geq 0. \\\\tag{3}\\n$$\\n\\nNow go back to the original equation and try $ y = 1 $:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x + 1) = f(x) + |f(1)|. \\\\tag{4}\\n$$\\n\\nSimilarly, $ y = -1 $:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x + 1) = f(x) + |-1 \\\\cdot f(-1)| = f(x) + |f(-1)|.\\n$$\\n\\nBut from above, $ |f(1)| = |f(-1)| $, so same result.\\n\\nLet $ c = |f(1)| $. Then:\\n\\n$$\\nf(x+1) = f(x) + c.\\n$$\\n\\nThis suggests that $ f $ is linear on integer steps, but only if $ c \\\\ne 0 $. But wait — this recurrence holds for all real $ x $, so $ f(x+n) = f(x) + n c $ for all real $ x $, integer $ n $.\\n\\nBut also from earlier, we have a relation between $ f(z) $ and $ f(-z) $.\\n\\nTry to use consistency.\\n\\nSuppose $ c \\\\ne 0 $. Then $ f(x) $ grows linearly as $ x \\\\to \\\\infty $ along steps of 1. But from equation (1):\\n\\n$$\\nf(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)|.\\n$$\\n\\nSuppose $ f(y) \\\\sim c y $ for large $ y $? Not necessarily, because $ f(x+1) = f(x) + c $, so $ f(x) = c x + d $ only if additive, but we don't know.\\n\\nWait — $ f(x+1) - f(x) = c $, so $ f(n) = f(0) + n c $ for integers $ n $.\\n\\nNow take $ y = n $, large integer.\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$$\\nf(n^2) = f(0) + |n f(n)| = f(0) + |n (f(0) + n c)| = f(0) + |n f(0) + n^2 c|.\\n$$\\n\\nBut also $ f(n^2) = f(0) + n^2 c $, since $ f(k) = f(0) + k c $ for integer $ k $, and $ n^2 $ is integer.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nf(0) + n^2 c = f(0) + |n f(0) + n^2 c|.\\n\\\\Rightarrow n^2 c = |n^2 c + n f(0)|.\\n$$\\n\\nDivide both sides by $ n^2 $ (for $ n \\\\ne 0 $):\\n\\n$$\\nc = \\\\left|c + \\\\frac{f(0)}{n}\\\\right|.\\n$$\\n\\nTake limit as $ n \\\\to \\\\infty $: RHS $ \\\\to |c| $, so $ c = |c| \\\\Rightarrow c \\\\geq 0 $, which we already knew since $ c = |f(1)| $.\\n\\nBut more importantly, for large $ n $, $ \\\\left|c + \\\\frac{f(0)}{n}\\\\right| = c $.\\n\\nBut $ c \\\\geq 0 $, so:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|c + \\\\frac{f(0)}{n}\\\\right| = c \\\\quad \\\\text{for all large } n.\\n$$\\n\\nSuppose $ f(0) \\\\ne 0 $. Then $ \\\\frac{f(0)}{n} \\\\to 0 $, but for finite $ n $, it's nonzero.\\n\\nIf $ c > 0 $, then for large $ n $, $ c + \\\\frac{f(0)}{n} > 0 $, so absolute value is just itself:\\n\\n$$\\nc = c + \\\\frac{f(0)}{n} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{f(0)}{n} = 0 \\\\Rightarrow f(0) = 0.\\n$$\\n\\nContradiction unless $ f(0) = 0 $.\\n\\nSo if $ c > 0 $, then $ f(0) = 0 $.\\n\\nBut suppose $ c = 0 $. Then $ |f(1)| = 0 \\\\Rightarrow f(1) = 0 $.\\n\\nThen from $ f(x+1) = f(x) $, so $ f $ is periodic with period 1?\\n\\nWait: $ f(x+1) = f(x) + c = f(x) $, so yes, periodic with period 1.\\n\\nBut also from equation (1):\\n\\n$$\\nf(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)|.\\n$$\\n\\nIf $ c = 0 $, then $ f(x+1) = f(x) $, so $ f $ is periodic with period 1.\\n\\nBut $ f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)| $.\\n\\nAs $ y \\\\to \\\\infty $, $ y^2 \\\\to \\\\infty $, but $ f(y^2) $ is bounded if $ f $ is periodic (since continuous? not assumed). Wait — no continuity assumed.\\n\\nBut $ f $ is defined on $ \\\\mathbb{R} $, arbitrary, but periodic with period 1, so values repeat every interval of length 1.\\n\\nBut $ f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)| $.\\n\\nLeft side: since $ f $ is periodic, $ f(y^2) $ is bounded in magnitude if $ f $ is bounded, but right side has $ |y f(y)| $, which could grow unless $ f(y) \\\\to 0 $.\\n\\nBut $ f(y) $ is periodic, so unless $ f(y) = 0 $ for all $ y $, $ |y f(y)| \\\\to \\\\infty $ as $ y \\\\to \\\\infty $ along values where $ f(y) \\\\ne 0 $.\\n\\nBut left side $ f(y^2) $ remains in the range of $ f $, which is a fixed set due to periodicity.\\n\\nSo unless $ f(y) = 0 $ for all $ y $, the right-hand side blows up.\\n\\nTherefore, to prevent contradiction, we must have $ f(y) = 0 $ for all $ y $, when $ c = 0 $.\\n\\nSo two cases:\\n\\nCase 1: $ c > 0 $ → leads to $ f(0) = 0 $, and $ f(n) = n c $, etc.\\nBut earlier we had:\\n\\nFrom $ f(n^2) = f(0) + |n f(n)| = 0 + |n (n c)| = n^2 c $, and also $ f(n^2) = f(0) + n^2 c = n^2 c $, consistent.\\n\\nBut now check the functional equation.\\n\\nAssume $ f(x) = c x $ for all $ x $? Try.\\n\\nThen LHS: $ f(x + y^2) = c(x + y^2) = c x + c y^2 $.\\nRHS: $ f(x) + |y f(y)| = c x + |y (c y)| = c x + |c| y^2 $.\\n\\nSo $ c x + c y^2 = c x + |c| y^2 \\\\Rightarrow c = |c| \\\\Rightarrow c \\\\geq 0 $, which is true.\\n\\nBut we also have from earlier that $ f(-z) = 2f(0) - f(z) = -f(z) $ since $ f(0)=0 $, so $ f $ is odd.\\n\\nBut if $ f(x) = c x $, then it is odd, good.\\n\\nBut is this satisfy the original?\\n\\nLHS: $ f(x+y^2) = c(x + y^2) $\\nRHS: $ f(x) + |y f(y)| = c x + |y \\\\cdot c y| = c x + c y^2 $, since $ c \\\\geq 0 $.\\n\\nYes! So $ f(x) = c x $ works for any $ c \\\\geq 0 $.\\n\\nBut wait — earlier when we considered $ y = -1 $, we had $ |f(-1)| = |f(1)| $, which holds since $ f(-1) = -c $, $ f(1) = c $, absolute values equal.\\n\\nBut now check equation (2): $ f(0) = f(-y^2) + |y f(y)| $\\n\\nWith $ f(x) = c x $, $ f(0) = 0 $, $ f(-y^2) = -c y^2 $, $ |y f(y)| = |y \\\\cdot c y| = c y^2 $, so RHS: $ -c y^2 + c y^2 = 0 = f(0) $, good.\\n\\nSo $ f(x) = c x $ for $ c \\\\geq 0 $ seems to work?\\n\\nBut wait — what about $ f(-x) $? We have $ f(-x) = -c x $, but from earlier derivation (equation 3): $ f(-z) = 2f(0) - f(z) = -f(z) $, so odd, which matches.\\n\\nBut is there a problem?\\n\\nTry $ y = 1 $, $ x = -1 $:\\n\\nLHS: $ f(-1 + 1^2) = f(0) = 0 $\\nRHS: $ f(-1) + |1 \\\\cdot f(1)| = -c + |c| = -c + c = 0 $, good.\\n\\nSeems okay.\\n\\nBut wait — what if $ c > 0 $, say $ c = 1 $, $ f(x) = x $.\\n\\nThen $ f(x + y^2) = x + y^2 $\\nRHS: $ f(x) + |y f(y)| = x + |y \\\\cdot y| = x + y^2 $, yes.\\n\\nSo works.\\n\\nBut earlier when $ c = 0 $, $ f(x) = 0 $, also works:\\n\\nLHS: $ f(x+y^2) = 0 $\\nRHS: $ 0 + |y \\\\cdot 0| = 0 $, good.\\n\\nSo all functions $ f(x) = c x $ for $ c \\\\geq 0 $ satisfy?\\n\\nBut wait — what about negative $ x $? We have $ f(-1) = -c $, but is that okay?\\n\\nBut in the functional equation, $ y $ appears as $ y^2 $ and $ y f(y) $, so sign of $ y $ doesn't matter much.\\n\\nBut let's test $ f(x) = c x $, $ c > 0 $, with $ y = -2 $, $ x = 3 $:\\n\\nLHS: $ f(3 + 4) = f(7) = 7c $\\nRHS: $ f(3) + |-2 f(-2)| = 3c + |-2 \\\\cdot (-2c)| = 3c + |4c| = 3c + 4c = 7c $, good.\\n\\nSo seems to work.\\n\\nBut wait — is $ f(x) = c x $ the only solution?\\n\\nEarlier we derived that $ f(x+1) = f(x) + c $, with $ c = |f(1)| $.\\n\\nBut if $ f(x) = c x $, then $ f(1) = c $, so $ |f(1)| = c $, consistent.\\n\\nBut suppose there is another function.\\n\\nFrom $ f(x + y^2) - f(x) = |y f(y)| $, the increment depends only on $ y $, not on $ x $. So the function increases by a fixed amount when adding $ y^2 $ to the argument.\\n\\nThis suggests that $ f $ is additive with respect to squares, but more strongly, the difference $ f(x + h) - f(x) $ is constant for $ h = y^2 $, for each fixed $ y $.\\n\\nIn particular, for each $ h \\\\geq 0 $, if $ h = y^2 $, then $ f(x+h) - f(x) = |y f(y)| $, which depends only on $ h $, since $ y = \\\\sqrt{h} $ or $ -\\\\sqrt{h} $, but $ |y f(y)| $ may depend on which branch.\\n\\nBut from earlier, $ |y f(y)| = | -y f(-y) | $, and we had $ |f(y)| = |f(-y)| $, so $ |y f(y)| = |y| |f(y)| $, symmetric in sign of $ y $.\\n\\nSo define $ g(h) = |y f(y)| $ for $ h = y^2 $, i.e., $ g(h) = \\\\sqrt{h} |f(\\\\sqrt{h})| $ for $ h > 0 $.\\n\\nBut from the equation, $ f(x + h) - f(x) = g(h) $ for all $ x $, and $ h \\\\geq 0 $.\\n\\nThis means that $ f $ is additively separable: the increment over interval $ h $ is independent of $ x $, so $ f $ must be linear!\\n\\nIndeed, for any $ h \\\\geq 0 $, $ f(x+h) - f(x) = g(h) $, which is Cauchy-like.\\n\\nAnd since this holds for all $ x $, and $ h \\\\geq 0 $, then $ f $ is linear on $ \\\\mathbb{R} $, at least for shifts by non-negative amounts.\\n\\nStandard result: if $ f(x+h) - f(x) $ depends only on $ h $ for all $ x $ and $ h \\\\geq 0 $, then $ f(x) = m x + b $.\\n\\nBut let's see:\\n\\nLet $ d(h) = f(x+h) - f(x) $, independent of $ x $.\\n\\nThen $ d(h_1 + h_2) = d(h_1) + d(h_2) $, because:\\n\\n$ f(x + h_1 + h_2) - f(x) = [f(x + h_1 + h_2) - f(x + h_1)] + [f(x + h_1) - f(x)] = d(h_2) + d(h_1) $.\\n\\nSo $ d(h_1 + h_2) = d(h_1) + d(h_2) $ for $ h_1, h_2 \\\\geq 0 $.\\n\\nAssuming some regularity (but no continuity), but in our case, $ d(h) = g(h) = |y f(y)| $ with $ y^2 = h $, so $ y = \\\\sqrt{h} $, so $ d(h) = \\\\sqrt{h} |f(\\\\sqrt{h})| $.\\n\\nBut also $ d(h) $ is additive on $ [0,\\\\infty) $.\\n\\nAdditive and of the form $ \\\\sqrt{h} |f(\\\\sqrt{h})| $.\\n\\nSet $ u = \\\\sqrt{h} $, so $ d(u^2) = u |f(u)| $.\\n\\nAnd $ d(u^2 + v^2) = d(u^2) + d(v^2) $, so:\\n\\n$ d(u^2 + v^2) = u |f(u)| + v |f(v)| $.\\n\\nBut $ d(u^2 + v^2) = \\\\sqrt{u^2 + v^2} |f(\\\\sqrt{u^2 + v^2})| $.\\n\\nThis seems messy unless $ f $ is linear.\\n\\nBut earlier we found that $ f(x) = c x $ works for $ c \\\\geq 0 $.\\n\\nTry $ f(x) = c x $, then $ d(h) = f(x+h) - f(x) = c h $, so $ d(h) = c h $, which is additive: $ c(h_1 + h_2) = c h_1 + c h_2 $, good.\\n\\nAnd $ d(h) = c h = \\\\sqrt{h} |f(\\\\sqrt{h})| = \\\\sqrt{h} |c \\\\sqrt{h}| = \\\\sqrt{h} \\\\cdot c \\\\sqrt{h} = c h $, good.\\n\\nNow, are there other solutions?\\n\\nSuppose $ d(h) $ is additive on $ [0,\\\\infty) $, so $ d(h) = k h $ for some $ k $, if we assume continuity or monotonicity, but without, there could be pathological solutions using Hamel basis.\\n\\nBut in our case, $ d(h) = \\\\sqrt{h} |f(\\\\sqrt{h})| $, and $ f $ is related.\\n\\nBut also from earlier, we have $ f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)| = f(0) + d(y^2) $.\\n\\nBut $ f(y^2) = f(0 + y^2) = f(0) + d(y^2) $, by definition of $ d $, so consistent.\\n\\nNow, if $ d(h) = k h $, then $ f(x + h) - f(x) = k h $ for all $ x $, $ h \\\\geq 0 $.\\n\\nThen $ f(x) = k x + b $ for all $ x $? \\n\\nFix $ x_0 $, then for any $ x > x_0 $, $ f(x) = f(x_0) + k (x - x_0) $.\\n\\nFor $ x < x_0 $, not directly, but we can go backwards?\\n\\nFrom earlier, we had equation (2): $ f(0) = f(-y^2) + |y f(y)| = f(-y^2) + d(y^2) $\\n\\nSo $ f(-y^2) = f(0) - d(y^2) $\\n\\nLet $ z = y^2 > 0 $, so $ f(-z) = f(0) - d(z) $\\n\\nBut $ d(z) = k z $, so $ f(-z) = f(0) - k z $\\n\\nNow, for any $ x $, and $ h > 0 $, $ f(x) = f(x - h) + d(h) $ only if $ x - h $ is such that we move forward by $ h $, but the functional equation only gives increment for adding $ y^2 \\\\geq 0 $, so we can only go forward.\\n\\nBut from above, for negative arguments, we have $ f(-z) = f(0) - k z $ for $ z > 0 $.\\n\\nNow, let’s compute $ f $ at any point.\\n\\nLet $ b = f(0) $.\\n\\nFor $ x \\\\geq 0 $, $ f(x) = f(0) + d(x) = b + k x $\\n\\nFor $ x < 0 $, let $ x = -z $, $ z > 0 $, then $ f(x) = f(-z) = b - k z = b + k x $\\n\\nBecause $ x = -z $, so $ k x = -k z $\\n\\nThus $ f(x) = b + k x $ for all $ x $.\\n\\nSo $ f $ is linear: $ f(x) = k x + b $\\n\\nNow plug into original equation.\\n\\nLHS: $ f(x + y^2) = k(x + y^2) + b = kx + k y^2 + b $\\n\\nRHS: $ f(x) + |y f(y)| = (k x + b) + |y (k y + b)| = kx + b + |k y^2 + b y| $\\n\\nSet equal:\\n\\n$ kx + k y^2 + b = kx + b + |k y^2 + b y| $\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n$ k y^2 = |k y^2 + b y| $\\n\\nThis must hold for all $ y $.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$ k y^2 = |k y^2 + b y| $ for all $ y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} $\\n\\nConsider $ y \\\\ne 0 $, divide both sides by $ y^2 $:\\n\\n$ k = \\\\left| k + \\\\frac{b}{y} \\\\right| $\\n\\nThis must hold for all $ y \\\\ne 0 $.\\n\\nAs $ y \\\\to \\\\infty $, $ \\\\frac{b}{y} \\\\to 0 $, so $ k = |k| \\\\Rightarrow k \\\\geq 0 $\\n\\nBut for finite $ y $, $ \\\\left| k + \\\\frac{b}{y} \\\\right| = k $\\n\\nSince $ k \\\\geq 0 $, this implies:\\n\\n$ k + \\\\frac{b}{y} \\\\geq 0 $ and $ \\\\left| k + \\\\frac{b}{y} \\\\right| = k $ ⇒ $ k + \\\\frac{b}{y} = k $ or $ k + \\\\frac{b}{y} = -k $\\n\\nBut $ |A| = k $, and $ A = k + b/y $, so:\\n\\nEither $ k + \\\\frac{b}{y} = k $ ⇒ $ b/y = 0 $ ⇒ $ b = 0 $\\n\\nOr $ k + \\\\frac{b}{y} = -k $ ⇒ $ \\\\frac{b}{y} = -2k $\\n\\nBut this must hold for all $ y $, which is impossible unless $ k = 0 $ and $ b = 0 $, but let's see.\\n\\nThe equation $ \\\\left| k + \\\\frac{b}{y} \\\\right| = k $ must hold for every $ y \\\\ne 0 $.\\n\\nSuppose $ b \\\\ne 0 $. Then $ \\\\frac{b}{y} $ takes all real values except 0 as $ y $ varies.\\n\\nBut $ \\\\left| k + t \\\\right| = k $ for $ t = b/y $, which takes infinitely many values.\\n\\nBut $ |k + t| = k $ implies $ k + t = k $ or $ k + t = -k $, so $ t = 0 $ or $ t = -2k $\\n\\nSo $ \\\\frac{b}{y} = 0 $ or $ \\\\frac{b}{y} = -2k $\\n\\nBut $ \\\\frac{b}{y} = 0 $ never happens since $ b \\\\ne 0 $, $ y $ finite.\\n\\nSo must have $ \\\\frac{b}{y} = -2k $ for all $ y $, impossible unless $ b = 0 $ and $ k = 0 $.\\n\\nTherefore, the only possibility is $ b = 0 $.\\n\\nThen the equation becomes $ k y^2 = |k y^2| = k y^2 $, since $ k \\\\geq 0 $, so true for all $ y $.\\n\\nThus $ f(x) = k x $ for some $ k \\\\geq 0 $.\\n\\nNow, $ f(0) = k \\\\cdot 0 = 0 $.\\n\\nTherefore, $ f(0) = 0 $ for all such functions.\\n\\nHence $ k = f(0) + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4 $.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 1 is 4.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nThere are 7 points in the plane. We draw circles through every set of 4 concyclic points. We want the maximum number of such circles.\\n\\nNote: A circle is determined by 3 non-collinear points. For 4 points to be concyclic, they must lie on a common circle.\\n\\nWe are to count the number of circles that pass through at least 4 of the 7 points, but the problem says: \\\"Circles are drawn through every 4 possible concyclic points.\\\"\\n\\nInterpretation: For every set of 4 points that are concyclic (i.e., lie on a common circle), we draw that circle. But multiple sets of 4 points might lie on the same circle.\\n\\nBut the circle is the same, so we should count distinct circles.\\n\\nThe problem asks for the maximum number of circles that can be drawn, so we need to arrange 7 points in the plane to maximize the number of distinct circles each passing through at least 4 of the points.\\n\\nBut the phrase \\\"every 4 possible concyclic points\\\" suggests that we consider each 4-tuple that is concyclic, and draw the circle through them. But if four points are concyclic, there is a unique circle through them (unless collinear, but then no circle), so we draw that circle.\\n\\nBut if five points are concyclic, then every subset of 4 of them will give the same circle. So we would draw the same circle multiple times, but probably we count distinct circles.\\n\\nThe problem says \\\"the maximum number of circles\\\", so likely distinct circles.\\n\\nTo maximize the number of distinct circles each passing through exactly 4 of the 7 points, or at least 4.\\n\\nBut if a circle passes through 5 points, it contributes only one circle, but covers many 4-tuples.\\n\\nTo maximize the number of circles, we should avoid having more than 4 points on a single circle, because if 5 are concyclic, we get only one circle instead of potentially more.\\n\\nFor example, if no 4 points are concyclic, then 0 circles.\\n\\nIf we have one set of 4 concyclic, others not, we get 1 circle.\\n\\nBut we want maximum.\\n\\nSo to maximize, we should have as many 4-tuples as possible being concyclic, but each on a different circle, meaning no 5 points concyclic, and no two different 4-tuples on the same circle unless forced.\\n\\nBut two different 4-tuples can share three points; if they are concyclic, they might define the same circle.\\n\\nSpecifically, if two 4-tuples share 3 points, and both are concyclic, then since 3 points determine a circle (if not collinear), both 4-tuples must lie on the same circle, so the circle is the same.\\n\\nTherefore, to have distinct circles, the 4-tuples must be such that no two share three points.\\n\\nIn other words, any two 4-element subsets that are concyclic must share at most two points.\\n\\nNow, total number of 4-element subsets of 7 points is $ \\\\binom{7}{4} = 35 $.\\n\\nEach circle that passes through exactly 4 points corresponds to one such 4-tuple.\\n\\nIf a circle passes through 5 points, it contains $ \\\\binom{5}{4} = 5 $ such 4-tuples, but only one circle.\\n\\nSimilarly, 6 points on a circle: $ \\\\binom{6}{4} = 15 $ 4-tuples, one circle.\\n\\n7 points: $ \\\\binom{7}{4} = 35 $, one circle.\\n\\nTo maximize the number of distinct circles, we should minimize the sharing, so best to have each circle pass through exactly 4 points, and no two circles share three points.\\n\\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of 4-element subsets such that any two intersect in at most 2 elements.\\n\\nThis is a combinatorial design problem.\\n\\nWe want a family of 4-element subsets of a 7-element set, pairwise intersecting in at most 2 elements.\\n\\nWhat is the maximum size of such a family?\\n\\nTotal number of pairs: $ \\\\binom{7}{2} = 21 $.\\n\\nEach 4-set contains $ \\\\binom{4}{2} = 6 $ pairs.\\n\\nIf the family has $ m $ such 4-sets, and any two share at most 2 points, then they share at most $ \\\\binom{2}{2} = 1 $ pair? No.\\n\\nIf two 4-sets intersect in at most 2 points, then the number of common pairs is at most $ \\\\binom{2}{2} = 1 $ if they intersect in 2 points, or 0 otherwise.\\n\\nBut actually, if they intersect in 2 points, they share exactly one pair (the pair of the two common points).\\n\\nIf intersect in 1 or 0, share no pair.\\n\\nBut different 4-sets can share pairs only if they intersect in at least 2 points.\\n\\nBut in our case, since intersection at most 2, they can share a pair only if they intersect in exactly those two points.\\n\\nNow, each pair of points can be in at most how many 4-sets in the family?\\n\\nSuppose a pair {a,b} is contained in some 4-set S. Can it be in another 4-set T?\\n\\nIf T contains {a,b}, and S contains {a,b}, then S ∩ T contains at least {a,b}, so |S ∩ T| ≥ 2.\\n\\nBut we allow |S ∩ T| ≤ 2, so equality, so S ∩ T = {a,b}.\\n\\nIs that possible? Yes, as long as no other common points.\\n\\nBut can a pair be in multiple such 4-sets?\\n\\nSuppose {a,b} is in two 4-sets S and T, with S ∩ T = {a,b}.\\n\\nS has two other points, say c,d; T has two other points e,f.\\n\\nAs long as c,d,e,f are distinct and different from a,b, it might be possible.\\n\\nBut we have only 7 points.\\n\\nTotal points: 7.\\n\\nFix pair {a,b}. The remaining points are 5: call them C,D,E,F,G.\\n\\nA 4-set containing {a,b} must include two more from these five.\\n\\nEach such 4-set is determined by choosing two more points.\\n\\nBut if I take S = {a,b,c,d}, T = {a,b,e,f}, then S ∩ T = {a,b}, good.\\n\\nCan I take another? U = {a,b,c,e}, but then U ∩ S = {a,b,c}, which has three points, not allowed.\\n\\nSo if I want multiple 4-sets containing {a,b}, they must be disjoint on the additional points.\\n\\nEach uses two of the remaining five points.\\n\\nMaximum number of pairwise disjoint pairs from five points: but pairs may overlap.\\n\\nTo have multiple 4-sets all containing {a,b}, and any two intersect only in {a,b}, then their additional point sets must be disjoint.\\n\\nEach adds two points, so from five points, I can have at most two such 4-sets, since 2+2=4 ≤ 5, and third would require two more, but only one left.\\n\\nFor example, S1 = {a,b,c,d}, S2 = {a,b,e,f}, and g left out.\\n\\nS1 ∩ S2 = {a,b}, good.\\n\\nCannot have a third 4-set containing {a,b} without reusing a point, say {a,b,c,g}, but then intersects S1 in {a,b,c}, three points.\\n\\nSo maximum two 4-sets per pair.\\n\\nBut we are not fixing a pair; we want the whole family.\\n\\nBack to counting.\\n\\nLet m be the number of 4-sets in the family.\\n\\nEach 4-set has 6 pairs.\\n\\nTotal number of pair-set incidences: 6m.\\n\\nEach pair of points can be in at most how many 4-sets?\\n\\nAs above, for a given pair, it can be in multiple 4-sets, but if two 4-sets both contain the same pair, then their intersection contains at least that pair, so to have |intersection| ≤ 2, they must intersect exactly in that pair.\\n\\nMoreover, as above, for a fixed pair, the number of 4-sets containing it is limited by the disjointness of the additional points.\\n\\nSpecifically, each such 4-set uses two additional points, and these sets of two must be pairwise disjoint (because if two 4-sets share an additional point, say both contain c, then intersection contains a,b,c, three points).\\n\\nSo the additional point pairs must be disjoint.\\n\\nWith 5 other points, maximum number of pairwise disjoint pairs is floor(5/2) = 2, but since each 4-set takes a pair, and pairs disjoint, maximum 2 such 4-sets per pair.\\n\\nMoreover, after taking two, one point left, cannot make another pair.\\n\\nSo each pair can be in at most 2 of the 4-sets in the family.\\n\\nNow, total number of pairs is $ \\\\binom{7}{2} = 21 $.\\n\\nEach can be covered at most twice.\\n\\nTotal pair-inclusions: sum over pairs of number of 4-sets containing it ≤ 21 * 2 = 42.\\n\\nBut each 4-set contains 6 pairs, so total pair-inclusions = 6m.\\n\\nThus 6m ≤ 42 ⇒ m ≤ 7.\\n\\nSo maximum possible m is 7.\\n\\nCan we achieve m=7?\\n\\nThat is, 7 such 4-sets, pairwise intersecting in at most 2 points.\\n\\nTotal pair-inclusions: 6*7=42, and 21 pairs * 2 = 42, so equality.\\n\\nTherefore, every pair must be in exactly two of the 4-sets.\\n\\nIs such a design possible?\\n\\nWe have 7 points, 7 blocks (4-sets), each pair in exactly two blocks.\\n\\nThis sounds familiar.\\n\\nNote that total number of blocks is 7, same as points.\\n\\nPerhaps a symmetric design.\\n\\nCheck parameters.\\n\\nIn combinatorial design, a 2-design or balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) with v=7 points, b=7 blocks, r=number of blocks per point, k=4 (block size), λ=2 (each pair in λ blocks).\\n\\nStandard equations: b k = v r, and b k (k-1) = v (v-1) λ / something, wait.\\n\\nStandard BIBD equations:\\n\\n1. b k = v r  (total point-block incidences)\\n\\n2. r (k-1) = λ (v-1)  (each point, number of other points paired with it)\\n\\nHere v=7, b=7, k=4, λ=2.\\n\\nFrom 1: 7*4 = 7*r ⇒ 28=7r ⇒ r=4.\\n\\nFrom 2: r(k-1) = λ(v-1) ⇒ 4*3 = 2*6 ⇒ 12=12, good.\\n\\nSo parameters are feasible.\\n\\nNow, does such a design exist?\\n\\nv=7, which is small.\\n\\nThe Fano plane is a BIBD with v=7, b=7, r=3, k=3, λ=1, but here we need k=4, λ=2.\\n\\nNote that the complement: each block has size 4, total points 7, so complement of a 4-set is a 3-set.\\n\\nIf we take complements, we get a family of 3-sets.\\n\\nEach 3-set corresponds to the complement.\\n\\nNow, original: each pair in exactly two 4-sets.\\n\\nA pair {a,b} is in a 4-set S iff a and b are in S, iff in the complement, a and b are not in the complement set.\\n\\nLet T_i be the complement of S_i, so |T_i|=3.\\n\\nNumber of T_i: 7.\\n\\nNow, for a pair {a,b}, how many T_i contain both a and b?\\n\\n{a,b} ⊆ T_i iff a and b are in T_i iff a and b are not in S_i.\\n\\nBut we know that {a,b} is in exactly two S_j's.\\n\\nTotal number of S_i's is 7.\\n\\nSo number of S_i's containing {a,b} is 2.\\n\\nThus number of S_i's not containing {a,b} is 7-2=5.\\n\\nBut S_i does not contain {a,b} means that at least one of a or b is not in S_i, i.e., at least one is in T_i.\\n\\nBut we want both a and b in T_i, i.e., neither in S_i.\\n\\nSo {a,b} ⊆ T_i iff a ∉ S_i and b ∉ S_i.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to {a,b} ∩ S_i = ∅.\\n\\nNow, total S_i's: 7.\\n\\nNumber that contain a: since each point is in r=4 blocks (from earlier, r=4), so number of S_i containing a is 4.\\n\\nSimilarly for b.\\n\\nBut we need S_i containing neither a nor b.\\n\\nBy inclusion, number containing a or b: |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B| = 4 + 4 - 2 = 6, since |A ∩ B| = number containing both a and b, which is λ=2.\\n\\nSo number containing a or b is 6.\\n\\nThus number containing neither is 7 - 6 = 1.\\n\\nTherefore, for each pair {a,b}, there is exactly one T_i that contains both a and b.\\n\\nThat is, each pair is in exactly one of the 3-sets T_i.\\n\\nMoreover, each T_i has size 3, so contains $ \\\\binom{3}{2}=3 $ pairs.\\n\\nTotal number of pair-T_i incidences: 7 T_i's * 3 pairs each = 21.\\n\\nNumber of pairs: $ \\\\binom{7}{2}=21 $, each in exactly one T_i, so perfect.\\n\\nThus the T_i's form a Steiner system S(2,3,7), which is the Fano plane, but Fano is for triplets, but usually Fano is projective plane of order 2, which has 7 points, 7 lines, each line has 3 points, each pair in exactly one line.\\n\\nYes! Exactly the Fano plane configuration.\\n\\nSo it exists.\\n\\nTherefore, such a design exists: take the complements of the lines of the Fano plane.\\n\\nIn the Fano plane, we have 7 points and 7 lines, each line has 3 points, each pair in exactly one line.\\n\\nThen the complements: each complement is a 4-set (since 7-3=4), and as above, each pair is in exactly two 4-sets.\\n\\nAnd any two 4-sets: since the T_i's (the lines) intersect in at most one point (in Fano plane, two lines intersect in exactly one point), so for two different T_i, T_j, |T_i ∩ T_j| = 1.\\n\\nThen for the 4-sets S_i = complement of T_i, S_j = complement of T_j.\\n\\n|S_i ∩ S_j| = ?\\n\\nS_i ∩ S_j = (all points not in T_i) ∩ (not in T_j) = not in T_i and not in T_j = complement of (T_i ∪ T_j)\\n\\n|T_i ∪ T_j| = |T_i| + |T_j| - |T_i ∩ T_j| = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5\\n\\nSo |complement| = 7 - 5 = 2\\n\\nThus |S_i ∩ S_j| = 2\\n\\nExactly 2, so satisfies the condition (at most 2, and here exactly 2).\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nSo we can have 7 such 4-sets, pairwise intersecting in exactly two points.\\n\\nNow, geometrically, can we embed 7 points in the plane such that for each of these 4-sets, the four points are concyclic, and no three of the 4-sets are on a larger circle?\\n\\nIn this construction, since any two 4-sets intersect in two points, and if we can arrange that for each 4-set, they are concyclic, and the circle is unique to that 4-set (since no five points concyclic, because if five points were concyclic, they would contain a 4-set, but more importantly, any five points would contain multiple 4-sets from our family, but in our family, do we have five points covered?\\n\\nTotal number of 4-sets is 7, each point is in r=4 of them (since earlier r=4 for the blocks).\\n\\nIs it possible that five points are concyclic? Suppose five points lie on a circle. How many of our 4-sets are contained in these five points?\\n\\nEach 4-set is a specific combination. The number of 4-subsets of a 5-set is $ \\\\binom{5}{4}=5 $.\\n\\nBut in our family, how many of these 5 possible 4-sets are actually in the family?\\n\\nNot necessarily.\\n\\nIn fact, in the design, the 4-sets are specific.\\n\\nBut to ensure that no five points are concyclic, we need that for any five points, they do not all lie on a circle.\\n\\nBut in the plane, five points in general position are not concyclic, so we can perturb to avoid that.\\n\\nSimilarly, we need that each of the seven 4-sets is concyclic.\\n\\nSo the question is: can we place 7 points in the plane such that each of these seven specific 4-tuples lies on a circle?\\n\\nNote that in the Fano plane complement, the configuration is combinatorial.\\n\\nBut geometrically, we need to realize it.\\n\\nEach 4-set must be concyclic.\\n\\nFour points are concyclic if they satisfy the condition that the quadrilateral has opposite angles summing to 180, or use the determinant condition, but perhaps we can think of circle arrangements.\\n\\nNote that in the plane, we can often realize such configurations.\\n\\nA known fact: the maximum number of circles through four points from seven points is indeed 7, achieved by the complement of the Fano plane configuration.\\n\\nMoreover, it is possible to embed the 7 points in the plane such that the required 4-tuples are concyclic.\\n\\nFor example, one can take points in a symmetric fashion.\\n\\nSince the combinatorial design exists and the conditions are open (being concyclic is a closed condition, but we can satisfy it generically), likely possible.\\n\\nTo confirm, suppose we start placing points.\\n\\nNote that each pair of points is in exactly two of the 4-sets, and each 4-set needs to be concyclic.\\n\\nBut since the constraints might be satisfiable.\\n\\nI recall that this is a known result; the maximum is 7.\\n\\nAnother way: total possible, and 7 is achievable.\\n\\nSuppose we try to have more than 7 circles.\\n\\nBut earlier we had m ≤ 7 from the pair counting, since 6m ≤ 42, m≤7.\\n\\nAnd equality is achieved, so maximum is 7.\\n\\nMoreover, in the geometric realization, as long as we can place the points so that each designated 4-tuple is concyclic, and no unintended concyclicities, but even if there are extra, but in this case, since we want maximum, and 7 is the upper bound, if we achieve 7, it's maximum.\\n\\nNow, is geometric realization possible?\\n\\nYes, for example, one can take six points on a circle, but that would make many 4-tuples concyclic, but we need only specific ones.\\n\\nBut in our case, we need exactly these seven 4-tuples to be concyclic, and possibly others, but if others are, it might force more, but we can arrange so that only these are concyclic.\\n\\nActually, in the plane, with general position, we can satisfy the concyclic conditions for these seven 4-sets by solving the equations, and since there are degrees of freedom, it should be possible.\\n\\nA specific construction: consider the vertices of a regular heptagon? But in regular heptagon, many sets are concyclic, but not necessarily matching our design.\\n\\nBut we don't need regular.\\n\\nI found online or recall that the maximum is indeed 7.\\n\\nSince the combinatorial upper bound is 7 and it's achievable combinatorially, and geometric realizability is possible (as the conditions are algebraic and independent), we can assume it's possible.\\n\\nTherefore, the maximum number of distinct circles is 7.\\n\\nEach circle is determined by one of the 4-sets, and since the 4-sets are different and circles are different (because if two 4-sets share only two points, they generally determine different circles), so we get 7 distinct circles.\\n\\nHence answer is 7.\\n\\nSo final answers:\\n\\nProblem 1: k = 4\\n\\nProblem 2: 7\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}",
