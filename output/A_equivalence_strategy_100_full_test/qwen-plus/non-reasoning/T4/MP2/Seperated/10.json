Try small values of $ a $:\\n\\n- $ a = 2 $: $ 3(4) + 1 = 13 $, $ 4b^2 = 13 $ → not divisible by 4\\n- $ a = 3 $: $ 3(9)+1 = 28 $, $ 4b^2 = 28 $ → $ b^2 = 7 $ → no\\n- $ a = 4 $: $ 3(16)+1 = 49 $, $ 4b^2 = 49 $ → $ b^2 = 49/4 $ → no\\n- $ a = 5 $: $ 3(25)+1 = 76 $, $ 4b^2 = 76 $ → $ b^2 = 19 $ → no\\n- $ a = 6 $: $ 3(36)+1 = 109 $ → $ b^2 = 109/4 $ → no\\n- $ a = 7 $: $ 3(49)+1 = 148 $ → $ b^2 = 37 $ → no\\n- $ a = 8 $: $ 3(64)+1 = 193 $ → $ b^2 = 193/4 $ → no\\n- $ a = 9 $: $ 3(81)+1 = 244 $ → $ b^2 = 61 $ → no\\n- $ a = 10 $: $ 3(100)+1 = 301 $ → $ b^2 = 301/4 $ → no\\n- $ a = 11 $: $ 3(121)+1 = 364 $ → $ b^2 = 91 $ → no\\n- $ a = 12 $: $ 3(144)+1 = 433 $ → $ b^2 = 433/4 $ → no\\n- $ a = 13 $: $ 3(169)+1 = 508 $ → $ b^2 = 127 $ → no\\n- $ a = 14 $: $ 3(196)+1 = 589 $ → $ b^2 = 589/4 $ → no\\n- $ a = 15 $: $ 3(225)+1 = 676 $ → $ 4b^2 = 676 $ → $ b^2 = 169 $ → $ b = 13 $ → yes!\\n\\nSo $ a = 15 $, and $ d = a - 14 = 15 - 14 = 1 $\\n\\nThus answer to Problem 1 is 1.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe are told that $ P $ is a degree 5 polynomial such that if $ z $ is a complex number satisfying $ z^5 + 2004z = 1 $, then $ P(z^2) = 0 $.\\n\\nLet’s denote:\\n\\n$$\\nz^5 + 2004z - 1 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nWe want a polynomial $ P $ of degree 5 such that $ P(z^2) = 0 $ whenever $ z $ satisfies this equation.\\n\\nSo each root $ z $ of the equation gives a value $ w = z^2 $, and $ P(w) = 0 $. But since $ P $ has degree 5, it can have at most 5 roots. So we expect that among the 5 solutions $ z $ of the quintic, their squares $ z^2 $ take on only 5 distinct values — but actually, there are 5 roots $ z_1, \\\\dots, z_5 $, so potentially 5 values $ z_i^2 $, and $ P $ vanishes at those, so likely $ P $ is the minimal polynomial (or multiple) with those roots.\\n\\nBut here's a better idea: Let’s suppose $ z $ satisfies:\\n\\n$$\\nz^5 + 2004z = 1\\n$$\\n\\nWe want to eliminate $ z $ in favor of $ w = z^2 $, and find a polynomial relation that $ w $ satisfies, using the equation.\\n\\nFrom $ w = z^2 $, we get $ z = \\\\sqrt{w} $, but better to express powers of $ z $ in terms of $ w $.\\n\\nWe have:\\n\\n$ z^5 = 1 - 2004z $\\n\\nMultiply both sides by $ z $:\\n\\n$ z^6 = z - 2004z^2 $\\n\\nBut $ z^6 = (z^2)^3 = w^3 $, and $ z^2 = w $, so:\\n\\n$$\\nw^3 = z - 2004w \\\\Rightarrow z = w^3 + 2004w\\n$$\\n\\nBut also $ z^2 = w $, so substitute:\\n\\n$$\\n(w^3 + 2004w)^2 = w\\n$$\\n\\nExpand left side:\\n\\n$$\\nw^2(w^2 + 2004)^2 = w\\n\\\\Rightarrow w^2(w^6 + 2\\\\cdot2004 w^3 + 2004^2) = w\\n$$\\nWait, better:\\n\\n$ (w^3 + 2004w)^2 = w^6 + 2\\\\cdot2004 w^4 + 2004^2 w^2 $\\n\\nSet equal to $ w $:\\n\\n$$\\nw^6 + 4008 w^4 + 2004^2 w^2 - w = 0\\n$$\\n\\nBut this still has a $ w $ term. Wait, we had:\\n\\n$ (w^3 + 2004w)^2 = w $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nw^6 + 4008 w^4 + 2004^2 w^2 = w\\n\\\\Rightarrow w^6 + 4008 w^4 + 2004^2 w^2 - w = 0\\n$$\\n\\nThis is degree 6, but we need a degree 5 polynomial $ P $ such that $ P(z^2) = 0 $. This suggests that the minimal polynomial might be degree 5, so perhaps this degree 6 polynomial has a factor of $ w $, or is reducible.\\n\\nBut let's double-check the logic.\\n\\nWe derived:\\n\\n$ z = w^3 + 2004w $ from $ w^3 = z - 2004w $\\n\\nThen $ z^2 = w $, so:\\n\\n$ (w^3 + 2004w)^2 = w $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$ w^2(w^2 + 2004)^2 = w $\\n\\nAssuming $ w \\\\ne 0 $, divide both sides by $ w $:\\n\\n$$\\nw(w^2 + 2004)^2 = 1\\n\\\\Rightarrow w(w^4 + 4008 w^2 + 2004^2) = 1\\n\\\\Rightarrow w^5 + 4008 w^3 + 2004^2 w - 1 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nAh! That’s better.\\n\\nSo $ w = z^2 $ satisfies:\\n\\n$$\\nw^5 + 4008 w^3 + 2004^2 w - 1 = 0\\n$$\\n\\nThis is a degree 5 polynomial in $ w $, so we can take:\\n\\n$$\\nP(w) = w^5 + 4008 w^3 + 2004^2 w - 1\\n$$\\n\\nIt is monic, degree 5, and vanishes at $ w = z^2 $ for every root $ z $ of the original equation. Since the original equation has 5 roots (counting multiplicity), and each gives a $ w = z^2 $, and this polynomial has degree 5, it must be the one (assuming distinct values, or at least that multiplicities work).\\n\\nSo $ P(w) = w^5 + 4008 w^3 + c w - 1 $, where $ c = 2004^2 $\\n\\nNow compute $ P(1) $ and $ P(-1) $:\\n\\nFirst, $ P(1) = 1 + 4008 + 2004^2 \\\\cdot 1 - 1 = 4008 + 2004^2 $\\n\\n$ P(-1) = (-1)^5 + 4008(-1)^3 + 2004^2(-1) - 1 = -1 - 4008 - 2004^2 - 1 = - (4008 + 2004^2 + 2) $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$ P(1) = 4008 + 2004^2 $\\n\\n$ P(-1) = - (4008 + 2004^2 + 2) $\\n\\nNow compute quotient:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \\\\frac{4008 + 2004^2}{-(4008 + 2004^2 + 2)} = -\\\\frac{A}{A + 2}\\n$$\\nwhere $ A = 4008 + 2004^2 $\\n\\nBut wait, note: $ 4008 = 2 \\\\times 2004 $, so:\\n\\nLet $ x = 2004 $, then:\\n\\n$ P(1) = 2x + x^2 $\\n$ P(-1) = - (2x + x^2 + 2) $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \\\\frac{x^2 + 2x}{-(x^2 + 2x + 2)} = -\\\\frac{x(x+2)}{x^2 + 2x + 2}\\n$$\\n\\nBut this doesn't simplify obviously. However, notice that numerator is $ x^2 + 2x $, denominator is $ x^2 + 2x + 2 $, so ratio is $ -\\\\frac{A}{A+2} $, with $ A = x^2 + 2x $\\n\\nBut this is not an integer. However, maybe I made a mistake.\\n\\nWait: earlier,\\n\\n$ P(w) = w^5 + 4008 w^3 + 2004^2 w - 1 $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$ P(1) = 1 + 4008 + 2004^2 - 1 = 4008 + 2004^2 $\\n\\nYes, the +1 and -1 cancel? No:\\n\\n$ w^5 = 1 $\\n$ 4008 w^3 = 4008 $\\n$ 2004^2 w = 2004^2 $\\n$ -1 $\\n\\nSo total: $ 1 + 4008 + 2004^2 - 1 = 4008 + 2004^2 $\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n$ P(-1) = (-1)^5 = -1 $\\n$ 4008*(-1)^3 = -4008 $\\n$ 2004^2*(-1) = -2004^2 $\\n$ -1 $\\n\\nSum: $ -1 -4008 -2004^2 -1 = - (4008 + 2004^2 + 2) $\\n\\nSo quotient:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \\\\frac{4008 + 2004^2}{-(4008 + 2004^2 + 2)} = - \\\\frac{K}{K+2},\\\\quad K = 4008 + 2004^2\\n$$\\n\\nBut $ K = 2004^2 + 2\\\\cdot2004 = 2004(2004 + 2) = 2004 \\\\times 2006 $\\n\\nAnd $ K + 2 = 2004\\\\times2006 + 2 $\\n\\nBut now, is this simplifiable? Probably not, but maybe the problem expects a numerical value?\\n\\nWait — but the problem says \\\"calculate the quotient\\\", implying it's a simple number. Maybe I made a mistake in deriving $ P $.\\n\\nAlternative approach: symmetry.\\n\\nSuppose $ z $ satisfies $ z^5 + 2004z = 1 $. Then $ P(z^2) = 0 $. There are 5 roots $ z_1,\\\\dots,z_5 $. For each, $ w_i = z_i^2 $, and $ P $ is degree 5, so likely $ P(w) = c \\\\prod_{i=1}^5 (w - z_i^2) $\\n\\nThen $ P(1) = c \\\\prod (1 - z_i^2) $, $ P(-1) = c \\\\prod (-1 - z_i^2) = c \\\\prod -(1 + z_i^2) = (-1)^5 c \\\\prod (1 + z_i^2) = -c \\\\prod (1 + z_i^2) $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \\\\frac{\\\\prod (1 - z_i^2)}{- \\\\prod (1 + z_i^2)} = - \\\\prod_{i=1}^5 \\\\frac{1 - z_i^2}{1 + z_i^2}\\n$$\\n\\nNote that $ \\\\frac{1 - z^2}{1 + z^2} = \\\\frac{(1 - z)(1 + z)}{(1 + z^2)} $, not helpful.\\n\\nAlternatively, consider functional equation.\\n\\nBut go back — in my derivation, I assumed $ w \\\\ne 0 $ to divide, but is $ w = 0 $ possible? If $ z^2 = 0 $, $ z = 0 $, but $ 0 + 0 = 0 \\\\ne 1 $, so $ z \\\\ne 0 $, so $ w \\\\ne 0 $, so division is valid.\\n\\nSo $ P(w) = w^5 + 4008 w^3 + 2004^2 w - 1 $ is correct.\\n\\nNow compute numerically:\\n\\nLet $ x = 2004 $\\nThen $ P(1) = 1 + 4008 + x^2 - 1 = x^2 + 4008 $\\nBut $ 4008 = 2x $, so $ P(1) = x^2 + 2x $\\n$ P(-1) = -1 -4008 -x^2 -1 = -x^2 -2x -2 $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \\\\frac{x^2 + 2x}{-x^2 -2x -2} = - \\\\frac{x(x+2)}{x^2 + 2x + 2}\\n$$\\n\\nNow $ x^2 + 2x + 2 = (x+1)^2 + 1 $, doesn't factor.\\n\\nBut notice: the numerator is $ x^2 + 2x $, denominator is $ x^2 + 2x + 2 $, so:\\n\\n$$\\n= - \\\\frac{A}{A + 2}, \\\\quad A = x^2 + 2x\\n$$\\n\\nWith $ x = 2004 $, $ A = 2004 \\\\times 2006 $\\n\\nBut this is not simplifying. However, perhaps the problem has a typo or I missed something.\\n\\nWait — in the derivation:\\n\\nFrom $ z^5 = 1 - 2004z $\\nMultiply by $ z $: $ z^6 = z - 2004 z^2 $\\nSo $ w^3 = z - 2004 w $\\nThen $ z = w^3 + 2004 w $\\nThen $ z^2 = w $ implies $ (w^3 + 2004w)^2 = w $\\nSo $ w^2 (w^2 + 2004)^2 = w $\\nThen $ w [ w (w^2 + 2004)^2 - 1 ] = 0 $\\nSince $ w \\\\ne 0 $, $ w (w^2 + 2004)^2 = 1 $\\nSo $ w (w^4 + 4008 w^2 + 2004^2) = 1 $\\nThus $ w^5 + 4008 w^3 + 2004^2 w - 1 = 0 $\\nCorrect.\\n\\nSo $ P(w) = w^5 + 4008 w^3 + 2004^2 w - 1 $\\n\\nNow $ P(1) = 1 + 4008 + 2004^2 - 1 = 4008 + 2004^2 $\\n$ P(-1) = -1 -4008 -2004^2 -1 = - (4008 + 2004^2 + 2) $\\n\\nSo ratio:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = \\\\frac{K}{- (K + 2)} = - \\\\frac{K}{K+2}, \\\\quad K = 2004^2 + 4008\\n$$\\n\\nBut $ 4008 = 2 \\\\times 2004 $, so $ K = 2004^2 + 2\\\\cdot2004 = 2004(2004 + 2) = 2004 \\\\times 2006 $\\n\\nNow, is there any reason this would simplify to an integer? Unlikely.\\n\\nBut perhaps the problem wants the value, and it's just a number, but it's huge.\\n\\nWait — maybe I need to reconsider the degree. The original equation is degree 5, so 5 roots z. Each gives a w = z^2. Could two z's give same w? Only if z and -z both roots. But if z is root, -z: (-z)^5 + 2004(-z) = -z^5 -2004z = - (z^5 + 2004z) = -1 \\\\ne 1 unless 1=0. So -z is not a root. So all z_i are distinct and no z_i = -z_j for i=j, so z_i^2 are all distinct? Not necessarily, could have z_i^2 = z_j^2 with z_i = -z_j, but we just saw if z is root, -z is not, so z_i^2 ≠ z_j^2 for i≠j? No: z_i^2 = z_j^2 implies z_i = ± z_j. If z_i = z_j, same root. If z_i = -z_j, then as above, if z_j is root, -z_j is not, contradiction. So all z_i^2 are distinct. So 5 distinct values, so P is exactly the polynomial we found, monic degree 5.\\n\\nSo P is correct.\\n\\nNow, the quotient P(1)/P(-1) is -K/(K+2) with K=2004*2006.\\n\\nBut this is not an integer. However, the problem asks to calculate it, so perhaps leave it, but it's not simplifying.\\n\\nWait — perhaps I miscalculated P(1):\\n\\nP(w) = w^5 + 4008 w^3 + (2004)^2 w - 1\\nP(1) = 1^5 = 1\\n+ 4008 * 1^3 = 4008\\n+ 2004^2 * 1 = 2004^2\\n- 1\\nSo 1 + 4008 + 2004^2 - 1 = 4008 + 2004^2\\nYes.\\nThe +1 and -1 cancel, leaving 4008 + 2004^2.\\nSimilarly for P(-1): (-1)^5 = -1\\n4008*(-1)^3 = 4008*(-1) = -4008\\n2004^2 * (-1) = -2004^2\\n-1\\nSum: -1 -4008 -2004^2 -1 = - (4008 + 2004^2 + 2)\\nYes.\\nSo ratio = (4008 + 2004^2) / [ - (4008 + 2004^2 + 2) ] = - A / (A+2) with A=4008+2004^2\\n\\nBut A = 2004^2 + 2*2004 = 2004*(2004+2) = 2004*2006\\nLet me compute A+2 = 2004*2006 + 2\\nNote that 2004*2006 = (2005-1)(2005+1) = 2005^2 - 1\\nSo A = 2005^2 - 1\\nA+2 = 2005^2 + 1\\nSo ratio = - (2005^2 - 1) / (2005^2 + 1)\\n\\nOh! That's nicer.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = - \\\\frac{2005^2 - 1}{2005^2 + 1}\\n$$\\n\\nBut still not a simple number. However, this is exact.\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"calculate the quotient\\\", and it might expect this form, but probably not.\\n\\nWait — perhaps I have a sign error.\\n\\nAnother thought: when I did z^6 = z - 2004 z^2, that's correct.\\nw^3 = z - 2004 w\\nThen z = w^3 + 2004 w\\nThen z^2 = (w^3 + 2004 w)^2 = w^6 + 2*2004 w^4 + 2004^2 w^2\\nSet equal to w:\\nw^6 + 4008 w^4 + 2004^2 w^2 - w = 0\\nEarlier I divided by w to get w^5 + 4008 w^3 + 2004^2 w - 1 = 0, which is correct for w≠0.\\nBut this polynomial is degree 5, so P(w) = w^5 + 4008 w^3 + 2004^2 w - 1, yes.\\n\\nPerhaps the constant term is wrong.\\n\\nLet me verify with a hypothetical root.\\nSuppose there is a real root. The function f(z) = z^5 + 2004z -1, f(0) = -1, f(1) = 1+2004-1=2004>0, so root in (0,1). Say z≈ very small, then z^5 negligible, 2004z≈1, z≈1/2004, then w = z^2 ≈ 1/2004^2\\nThen P(w) should be approximately -1, since w small, P(w) ≈ -1, not zero. But w is small positive, P(w) = w^5 + ... + 2004^2 w -1 ≈ 2004^2 * (1/2004^2) -1 = 1 -1 =0, yes! Because 2004^2 * w = 2004^2 * (1/2004^2) =1, and other terms smaller, so P(w)≈1 -1=0, good.\\n\\nSo P is correct.\\n\\nNow, the quotient is - (2005^2 -1)/(2005^2 +1)\\n\\nBut this is not an integer. However, the problem might expect a numerical expression, but it says \\\"calculate\\\", and in context, perhaps it's fine.\\n\\nBut let's see the first problem was to output d=1, and this is a fraction.\\n\\nPerhaps I need to realize that P is defined up to scalar multiple? But the condition P(z^2)=0 determines P up to scalar, but the quotient P(1)/P(-1) is invariant under scaling, so it's well-defined.\\n\\nSo it must be - (2005^2 -1)/(2005^2 +1)\\n\\nBut 2005^2 = (2000+5)^2 = 2000^2 + 2*2000*5 +25 = 4,000,000 + 20,000 + 25 = 4,020,025\\nSo 2005^2 -1 = 4,020,024\\n2005^2 +1 = 4,020,026\\nSo ratio = -4020024 / 4020026 = -2010012 / 2010013 after dividing by 2?\\n4020024 ÷ 2 = 2010012, 4020026 ÷ 2 = 2010013, and 2010012 and 2010013 are consecutive integers, so coprime, so fraction is -2010012/2010013\\n\\nBut this is ugly, and unlikely.\\n\\nPerhaps I have a mistake in the derivation.\\n\\nLet me double-check the step:\\nFrom z^5 = 1 - 2004z\\nMultiply by z: z^6 = z - 2004 z^2\\nYes.\\nw = z^2, so w^3 = z^6 = z - 2004 w\\nSo w^3 = z - 2004 w\\nThus z = w^3 + 2004 w\\nThen z^2 = w, so (w^3 + 2004 w)^2 = w\\nYes.\\nThen w^2 (w^2 + 2004)^2 = w\\nFor w≠0, divide by w: w (w^2 + 2004)^2 = 1\\nYes.\\nThen w (w^4 + 4008 w^2 + 2004^2) = 1\\nSo w^5 + 4008 w^3 + 2004^2 w = 1\\nThus w^5 + 4008 w^3 + 2004^2 w - 1 = 0\\nCorrect.\\n\\nPerhaps the polynomial P is not this, because this is satisfied by w=z^2 for each root z, but this polynomial may have extra roots or something, but since there are 5 values w_i, and this is degree 5, it should be the minimal polynomial, so P is a constant times this. But again, quotient unaffected.\\n\\nUnless for some z, w=0, but not.\\n\\nPerhaps the equation has less than 5 distinct w, but earlier argument suggests all w_i are distinct.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps P is the minimal polynomial, but it might be of lower degree if there are dependencies, but unlikely.\\n\\nPerhaps I need to consider that the map z to z^2 might not be injective, but in this case, as established, no two roots have the same square.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem is that for each z, w=z^2 is a root of P, but P could have other roots, but the problem says \\\"there exists a polynomial P of degree 5\\\" with that property, so we can take the one that is exactly the product over the five values, so our P is fine.\\n\\nPerhaps the quotient is simply -1, but calculation shows otherwise.\\n\\nWait — let's compute the actual value.\\nLet me set u = w, P(u) = u^5 + 4008 u^3 + 2004^2 u - 1\\nP(1) = 1 + 4008 + 2004^2 - 1 = 4008 + 2004^2\\n2004^2 = (2000+4)^2 = 2000^2 + 2*2000*4 + 16 = 4,000,000 + 16,000 + 16 = 4,016,016\\nThen 4008 + 4,016,016 = 4,020,024\\nP(-1) = -1 -4008 -4,016,016 -1 = -4,020,026\\nSo P(1)/P(-1) = 4,020,024 / (-4,020,026) = -4,020,024 / 4,020,026\\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 2: -2,010,012 / 2,010,013\\nAnd these are consecutive integers almost, 2010013 - 2010012 =1, so coprime, so it's -2010012/2010013\\n\\nBut earlier I said 2005^2 = 4,020,025, so 2005^2 -1 = 4,020,024, 2005^2 +1 = 4,020,026, yes! So - (2005^2 -1)/(2005^2 +1)\\n\\nSo the answer is - (2005^2 -1)/(2005^2 +1)\\n\\nBut perhaps the problem expects this as a single number, but it's a fraction.\\n\\nMaybe I misinterpreted the polynomial.\\n\\nAnother thought: the polynomial P is of degree 5, and P(z^2)=0 whenever z^5 +2004z=1, but perhaps P is not monic, or perhaps it's defined differently.\\n\\nPerhaps 'there exists' means we can choose P, but we want the quotient, which might depend on P, but if P is scaled, quotient is the same, so it's determined.\\n\\nUnless there are multiple such P, but any such P must vanish at the five points w_i = z_i^2, and since there are 5 points, and P degree 5, it must be of the form c times the minimal polynomial, so unique up to scale, so quotient is fixed.\\n\\nSo it must be this value.\\n\\nPerhaps the answer is -1, but clearly not.\\n\\nOr perhaps I have a sign error in P(-1).\\nP(-1) = (-1)^5 = -1\\n4008 * (-1)^3 = 4008 * (-1) = -4008\\n2004^2 * (-1) = -2004^2\\nconstant -1\\nSum: -1 -4008 -2004^2 -1 = - (4008 + 2004^2 + 2) = - (4,016,016 + 4008 + 2) = -4,020,026, yes.\\nP(1) = 1 + 4008 + 4,016,016 -1 = 4,020,024, yes.\\nRatio negative, magnitude less than 1.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem has a different interpretation.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps 'P(z^2) = 0' means that z^2 is a root of P, which is what I assumed.\\n\\nPerhaps P is applied to z^2, and it's zero, yes.\\n\\nPerhaps the polynomial is in z, but no, it says P(z^2)=0, and P is a polynomial, so P evaluated at z^2 is 0.\\n\\nPerhaps for all such z, P(z^2)=0, which is what I used.\\n\\nI think my reasoning is correct.\\n\\nPerhaps the quotient is to be simplified, and it's - (2005^2 -1)/(2005^2 +1), but maybe they want the numerical value, but it's not nice.\\n\\nPerhaps in the context, the answer is -1, but only if the constant term is different.\\n\\nLet me try to see if there's a different way.\\n\\nLet the roots be z1 to z5. Then the elementary symmetric polynomials can be read from z^5 + 0*z^4 + 0*z^3 + 0*z^2 + 2004 z -1 =0, so sum zi =0, sum zi zj =0, etc.\\n\\nWe want prod (1 - zi^2) / prod (1 + zi^2) times -1 from earlier.\\n\\nP(1)/P(-1) = [ prod (1 - wi) ] / [ prod (-1 - wi) ] = prod (1 - wi) / [ (-1)^5 prod (1 + wi) ] = - prod (1 - wi) / prod (1 + wi) = - prod [(1 - wi)/(1 + wi)]\\n\\nAnd wi = zi^2, so - prod [(1 - zi^2)/(1 + zi^2)]\\n\\nNow (1 - z^2)/(1 + z^2) = [ (1-z)(1+z) ] / (1 + z^2)\\n\\nNot helpful.\\n\\nNote that (1 - z^2)/(1 + z^2) = 1 - 2z^2/(1+z^2), still not helpful.\\n\\nPerhaps use the fact that the product can be related to resultant or something, but complicated.\\n\\nPerhaps accept that the answer is - (2005^2 -1)/(2005^2 +1) = -4020024/4020026 = -2010012/2010013\\n\\nBut for the sake of the problem, perhaps they want the value as -1, but that's incorrect.\\n\\nAnother thought: in the first problem, they redirected to a different problem, so for problem 2, perhaps there's a trick.\\n\\nPerhaps P is not the polynomial I think.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps 'P of degree 5' and 'P(z^2)=0', but z^2 might not be sufficient; perhaps P is such that when you plug in z^2, you get 0, but maybe P is in terms of z^2, but no.\\n\\nPerhaps the polynomial P is meant to be satisfied by z^2 for each z satisfying the equation, which is what I have.\\n\\nPerhaps the answer is 1, but P(1) and P(-1) have opposite signs, so quotient negative.\\n\\nPerhaps I miscalculated the constant term.\\n\\nWhen I have w (w^2 + 2004)^2 = 1, so the equation is w^5 + 4008 w^3 + 2004^2 w - 1 = 0, so constant term -1, yes.\\n\\nPerhaps for P(-1), but -1 is not a root, so P(-1) ≠0, good.\\n\\nPerhaps the quotient is -1, but only if P(1) = - P(-1), but 4e6 vs -4e6, close but not equal.\\n\\nDifference is 2 in magnitude.\\n\\nPerhaps in the problem, the equation is z^5 + 2004 z = 0 or something, but no, =1.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps 'calculate the quotient' and it's a constant, and from the expression -A/(A+2) with A large, approximately -1, but not exactly.\\n\\nPerhaps the answer is -1, and they approximate, but the problem asks for exact.\\n\\nPerhaps I need to box the answers as per calculation.\\n\\nFor problem 1, d=1.\\nFor problem 2, P(1)/P(-1) = - (2005^2 -1)/(2005^2 +1) = -4020024/4020026 = -2010012/2010013\\n\\nBut perhaps simplify as - (2005^2 -1)/(2005^2 +1)\\n\\nSince 2005^2 -1 = (2005-1)(2005+1) = 2004*2006, and 2005^2 +1, no common factors, so -2004*2006 / (2005^2 +1)\\n\\nBut 2005^2 +1 = 4,020,025 +1 = 4,020,026\\n2004*2006 = (2005-1)(2005+1) = 2005^2 -1 = 4,020,024\\nSo -4,020,024 / 4,020,026\\n\\nPerhaps leave as - \\\\frac{2004 \\\\times 2006}{2005^2 + 1} but not better.\\n\\nGiven that, and since the first answer is 1, perhaps for problem 2 the answer is -1, but I think it's not.\\n\\nWait — perhaps the polynomial P is not required to be monic, but the quotient is the same.\\n\\nPerhaps 'the quotient' means something else, but unlikely.\\n\\nAnother thought: perhaps P is of degree 5, but the values z^2 are not all distinct, but earlier argument suggests they are.\\n\\nUnless for some i,j, zi^2 = zj^2 with i≠j, which requires zi = - zj, but if zj is root, -zj is not, as (-zj)^5 +2004(-zj) = - (zj^5 +2004 zj) = -1 ≠1, so indeed, -zj is not a root, so no, all zi^2 are distinct.\\n\\nSo 5 distinct values, P degree 5, so P is uniquely determined up to scale.\\n\\nSo I think the answer is - (2005^2 -1)/(2005^2 +1)\\n\\nBut perhaps in the context of the problem, they want the numerical value, but for the JSON, I need to put the exact value.\\n\\nPerhaps simplify as - \\frac{2004 \\times 2006}{2005^2 + 1} but still.\\n\\nNotice that 2005^2 +1 = 2005^2 +1, and 2004*2006 = 2005^2 -1, so - (2005^2 -1)/(2005^2 +1)\\n\\nSo the answer is - \\\\frac{2005^2 - 1}{2005^2 + 1}\\n\\nBut for the box, perhaps write the decimal, but no, exact.\\n\\nPerhaps the answer is -1, and I have a mistake.\\n\\nLet me search online or think differently.\\n\\nPerhaps the polynomial P is such that P(z^2) = k (z^5 +2004z -1) for some k, but that would make P of degree 10 in z, not possible.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps 'P(z^2) = 0' means that z^2 is a root, but P is applied to the number z^2, which is correct.\\n\\nPerhaps for each z satisfying the equation, z^2 is a root of P, which is what I have.\\n\\nI think I have to go with it.\\n\\nPerhaps the quotient is 1, but signs are different.\\n\\nOr perhaps P(-1) is in the denominator, and it's negative, P(1) positive, so quotient negative.\\n\\nPerhaps the answer is -2010012/2010013, but that's specific.\\n\\nPerhaps in the first problem, they gave a hint, and for problem 2, similarly.\\n\\nAnother thought: perhaps the polynomial P can be chosen, and we can choose it so that the quotient is nice, but 'there exists' means we can choose, but the quotient might depend on the choice, but if I choose a different P, say 2P, then P(1)/P(-1) is the same, so invariant.\\n\\nIf I choose a P that has extra roots, but then degree >5, but the problem says degree 5, so it must be exactly degree 5, so must be proportional to the minimal polynomial, so unique up to scale.\\n\\nSo I think it's correct.\\n\\nPerhaps the answer is -1, and the constant term is +1, but in the equation it's =1, so when w=0, left side 0, right side 1, so not, so constant term -1 is correct.\\n\\nPerhaps in the multiplication, when I did z^6 = z - 2004 z^2, but z^6 = (z^2)^3 = w^3, and z - 2004 z^2 = z - 2004 w, so w^3 = z - 2004 w, yes.\\n\\nThen z = w^3 + 2004 w, then (w^3 + 2004 w)^2 = w, yes.\\n\\nSo I think it's correct.\\n\\nPerhaps for the answer, they want the value as a reduced fraction.\\n\\nSo P(1)/P(-1) = -4020024 / 4020026 = -2010012 / 2010013\\n\\nAnd since 2010012 and 2010013 are consecutive integers (2010013 - 2010012 =1), so gcd is 1, so it's already reduced.\\n\\nSo answer is -2010012/2010013\\n\\nBut this is ugly, and likely not.\\n\\nPerhaps I need to box the answers.\\n\\nFor problem 1, answer is 1.\\nFor problem 2, perhaps I missed something.\\n\\nLet me read the problem again: 'Calculate the quotient P(1) / P(-1)'\\n\\nPerhaps P is monic, but still.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps ' the following property: if z^{5}+2004 z=1, then P(z^{2})=0 ' , and P degree 5, but perhaps P is not with real coefficients, but likely it is.\\n\\nPerhaps the polynomial is in real coefficients, and it's fine.\\n\\nPerhaps the quotient is an integer, and I have a mistake in the beginning.\\n\\nLet's try a smaller case. Suppose instead of 2004, a smaller number, say z^2 + 2z = 1, so z^2 +2z -1=0, roots z = -1±√2\\nThen w = z^2, for z1 = -1+√2, w1 = (-1+√2)^2 = 1 -2√2 +2 = 3 -2√2\\nz2 = -1-√2, w2 = (-1-√2)^2 = 1 +2√2 +2 = 3+2√2\\nSo P(w) = (w - (3-2√2))(w - (3+2√2)) = (w-3)^2 - (2√2)^2 = w^2 -6w +9 -8 = w^2 -6w +1\\nSo P(w) = w^2 -6w +1\\nThen P(1) = 1-6+1 = -4\\nP(-1) = 1 +6 +1 = 8\\nQuotient = -4/8 = -1/2\\nAccording to my method: from z^2 = 1 -2z (since z^2 +2z =1, so z^2 =1-2z)\\nMultiply by z: z^3 = z -2 z^2\\nw = z^2, so w^{3/2} = z^3, not good.\\nFor degree 2, multiply by z once: z^3 = z -2 w\\nBut z^3 = z * z^2 = z w\\nSo z w = z -2 w\\nAssume z≠0, divide by z: w = 1 -2 w / z, not good.\\nFrom z^2 =1-2z, and w= z^2, so w =1-2z, so z = (1-w)/2\\nThen w = z^2 = [(1-w)/2]^2 = (1 -2w + w^2)/4\\nSo 4w = 1 -2w + w^2\\n w^2 -6w +1 =0, same as above.\\nIn my general method, for general n, if z^n + a z =1, then for n=2, a=2.\\nThen from z^2 =1-2z\\nMultiply by z: z^3 = z -2 z^2\\nThen w = z^2, so for n=2, I multiplied by z, got z^3, which is z * w, not a power of w.\\nIn the original problem, n=5, I multiplied by z to get z^6 = (z^2)^3 = w^3, which worked because 6 is even.\\nFor general n, to get a power of w, I need to multiply by z^{k} so that the exponent is even.\\nIn this case for n=5, I multiplied by z^1, got z^6, which is (z^2)^3 = w^3, good.\\nFor n=2, if I multiply by z^0, z^2 =1-2z, not in w.\\nMultiply by z^2: z^4 = z^2 -2 z^3\\nBut z^4 = (z^2)^2 = w^2\\n z^2 = w\\n z^3 = z * z^2 = z w\\nSo w^2 = w -2 (z w) = w -2z w\\nSo w^2 = w(1 -2z)\\nAssume w≠0, divide: w = 1 -2z\\nThen from earlier, z = (1-w)/2, then w = [(1-w)/2]^2, same as before.\\nSo in the original problem, my method is correct.\\nFor the small case, P(1)/P(-1) = -4/8 = -1/2\\nAccording to the formula I had, if I were to apply the same logic, but for n=5, it's different.\\nSo for the actual problem, my calculation stands.\\nPerhaps the answer is -1, but in this small case it's -1/2, not -1.\\nSo for the original, it's not -1.\\nI think I have to conclude.\\nSo for problem 1, answer is 1.\\nFor problem 2, answer is -2010012/2010013, but perhaps write as - \\frac{2004 \\times 2006}{2005^2 + 1} but in the box, put the number.\\nSince the problem might expect a simple answer, and given that in the first problem they redirected, perhaps for problem 2, there's a similar redirect, but not specified.\\nAnother idea: perhaps ' the quotient P(1) / P(-1) ' and P is monic, but still the same.\\nPerhaps P(1) and P(-1) are to be taken as values, and the quotient is a constant, and in the context, perhaps it's -1, but calculation shows otherwise.\\nPerhaps I miscalculated the constant.\\nIn the equation w^5 + 4008 w^3 + 2004^2 w = 1, so P(w) = w^5 + 4008 w^3 + 2004^2 w - 1, yes.\\nPerhaps the polynomial is defined as the minimal polynomial, but it's the same.\\nI think I need to box the answers.\\nSo for problem 1: 1\\nFor problem 2: -2010012/2010013\\nBut to write it nicely, perhaps - \\frac{2004 \\times 2006}{2005^2 + 1} but in the JSON, put the fraction.\\nSince 2004*2006 = 4,020,024, and 2005^2 +1 = 4,020,026, so -4020024/4020026 = -2010012/2010013\\nSo I'll go with that.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-2010012/2010013\"\n}",
