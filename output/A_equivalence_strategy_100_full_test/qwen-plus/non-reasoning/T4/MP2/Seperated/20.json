However, the phrasing is ambiguous: \\\"k is the part size in the solution with the smallest possible n, derived from the structural consideration of minimal number of terms...\\\"\\n\\nBut since we are to minimize $ n $, let’s first try small values of $ n $ and see when such a decomposition is possible.\\n\\nLet’s denote:\\n- Sum: $ S = \\\\sum k_i = 5n - 4 $\\n- Reciprocal sum: $ R = \\\\sum \\\\frac{1}{k_i} = 1 $\\n\\nWe aim to minimize $ n $.\\n\\nBy Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-HM inequality:\\n\\nThe harmonic mean of the $ k_i $ is:\\n$$\\n\\\\text{HM} = \\\\frac{n}{\\\\sum \\\\frac{1}{k_i}} = \\\\frac{n}{1} = n\\n$$\\n\\nThe arithmetic mean is:\\n$$\\n\\\\text{AM} = \\\\frac{5n - 4}{n} = 5 - \\\\frac{4}{n}\\n$$\\n\\nWe know that $ \\\\text{AM} \\\\geq \\\\text{HM} $, so:\\n$$\\n5 - \\\\frac{4}{n} \\\\geq n\\n\\\\Rightarrow 5n - 4 \\\\geq n^2\\n\\\\Rightarrow n^2 - 5n + 4 \\\\leq 0\\n\\\\Rightarrow (n - 1)(n - 4) \\\\leq 0\\n\\\\Rightarrow 1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 4\\n$$\\n\\nSo $ n \\\\leq 4 $. Thus the minimal possible $ n $ is at least 1, and maximal allowed by inequality is 4. But we want the **smallest possible $ n $** such that such a decomposition exists. Wait — actually, we want the **solution with the smallest possible $ n $**, and from that, extract $ k $.\\n\\nBut wait: AM ≥ HM gives a necessary condition. So only $ n = 1,2,3,4 $ are possible.\\n\\nLet’s check each starting from $ n=1 $ upward.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Try $ n = 1 $:**\\n\\nThen $ k_1 = 5(1) - 4 = 1 $, and $ \\\\frac{1}{k_1} = 1 $ → OK.\\n\\nSo $ k_1 = 1 $, sum = 1, reciprocal sum = 1/1 = 1 → satisfies.\\n\\nSo $ n=1 $ works!\\n\\nThen $ k = k_1 = 1 $, so $ e = 1 + 2021 = 2022 $\\n\\nWait — is this valid?\\n\\nYes: $ k_1 = 1 $, sum = 1 = 5×1 − 4 = 1 ✓, reciprocal sum = 1 ✓.\\n\\nSo the minimal $ n $ is 1, and $ k = 1 $, so $ e = 2022 $\\n\\nBut let's double-check if the problem allows $ k_i = 1 $. It says positive integers — yes, 1 is allowed.\\n\\nIs there any restriction that the $ k_i $ must be greater than 1? No.\\n\\nSo $ n=1 $, $ k_1=1 $ is valid.\\n\\nHence $ e = 1 + 2021 = 2022 $\\n\\nBut wait — the problem says \\\"find all positive integers $ n, k_1, \\\\dots, k_n $\\\", but then says instead, just compute $ e = k + 2021 $, where $ k $ is the part size in the solution with smallest $ n $, derived from structural consideration of minimal number of terms.\\n\\nIn $ n=1 $, the only part size is $ k=1 $, so that should be it.\\n\\nBut let me verify if maybe the problem implies multiple parts or something else?\\n\\nWait — could there be an issue with $ k_i = 1 $? The reciprocal is 1, so sum of reciprocals is 1, which is good.\\n\\nSum of $ k_i $ is 1, and $ 5n - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1 $, so matches.\\n\\nSo $ n=1 $ is valid.\\n\\nBut let's check $ n=2 $ just to be sure we didn't misread.\\n\\n**n=2**: sum = 5*2 - 4 = 6; reciprocal sum = 1\\nSo need two positive integers $ a,b $ such that $ a+b=6 $, $ 1/a + 1/b = 1 $\\n\\n$ 1/a + 1/(6-a) = 1 $\\nMultiply: $ \\\\frac{6}{a(6-a)} = 1 $? Wait:\\n\\n$ \\\\frac{1}{a} + \\\\frac{1}{6-a} = \\\\frac{6}{a(6-a)} $? No:\\n\\nActually:\\n$ \\\\frac{1}{a} + \\\\frac{1}{b} = \\\\frac{a+b}{ab} = \\\\frac{6}{ab} = 1 \\\\Rightarrow ab = 6 $\\nAnd $ a+b=6 $\\nSo $ a,b $ roots of $ x^2 - 6x + 6 = 0 $? No: $ ab=6 $, $ a+b=6 $\\nThen $ x^2 - 6x + 6 = 0 $ → discriminant 36−24=12 → not integer.\\n\\nCheck pairs:\\n(1,5): 1+1/5=1.2 ≠1\\n(2,4): 0.5+0.25=0.75≠1\\n(3,3): 1/3+1/3=2/3≠1\\nNo solution for n=2.\\n\\nn=3: sum = 5*3−4=11; recip sum=1\\nCan three positive integers sum to 11 and reciprocals sum to 1?\\nTry possibilities.\\nSuppose all ≥2: max recip sum: if all 2: 1/2+1/2+1/2=1.5>1, so possible.\\nBut sum would be at least 6, here sum is 11.\\nTry (2,3,6): sum=11? 2+3+6=11 ✓\\nRecip: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = (3+2+1)/6 = 6/6=1 ✓\\nSo (2,3,6) works for n=3.\\nBut n=1 already works, so minimal n is 1.\\n\\nSo why even consider others?\\n\\nUnless… is $ k_i = 1 $ disallowed implicitly?\\nBecause in Egyptian fractions, sometimes 1 is avoided, but the problem says positive integers, no restriction.\\n\\nBut let's read again: \\\"find all positive integers $ n, k_1, \\\\dots, k_n $\\\" such that sum is $ 5n-4 $ and reciprocal sum is 1.\\nFor $ n=1 $: $ k_1=1 $, sum=1, 5*1−4=1, and 1/1=1 → valid.\\n\\nSo minimal $ n=1 $, $ k=1 $, $ e=1+2021=2022 $\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"the part size in the solution\\\" — singular. In $ n=1 $, only one part, size 1.\\n\\nSo answer should be 2022.\\n\\nBut let me see if maybe the problem wants the *maximum* part size or minimum? It says \\\"the part size\\\", but only one.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality?\\n\\nEarlier I used AM ≥ HM:\\nAM = (5n−4)/n = 5 − 4/n\\nHM = n (since reciprocal sum is 1)\\nSo 5 − 4/n ≥ n → n² −5n +4 ≤0 → (n−1)(n−4)≤0 → n∈[1,4]\\nSo n=1,2,3,4\\nn=1 is allowed.\\n\\nBut wait: HM = n² / sum(1/k_i) ? No.\\nHarmonic mean is defined as:\\n$$\\n\\\\text{HM} = \\\\frac{n}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{1}{k_i}} = \\\\frac{n}{1} = n\\n$$\\nYes.\\nAM = (sum k_i)/n = (5n−4)/n = 5 − 4/n\\nAM ≥ HM ⇒ 5 − 4/n ≥ n ⇒ multiply both sides by n (n>0):\\n5n − 4 ≥ n² ⇒ n² −5n +4 ≤0 ⇒ (n−1)(n−4)≤0 ⇒ n∈[1,4]\\nSo n cannot be less than 1 or greater than 4.\\nThus n=1 is the smallest possible.\\n\\nSo unless the problem has an implicit constraint (like k_i ≥2), n=1 is valid.\\nBut if k_i=1 were invalid, then we'd go to higher n.\\nBut the problem says positive integers — 1 is allowed.\\n\\nPerhaps \\\"part size\\\" refers to something else? Or maybe in the context of Egyptian fractions, 1 is trivial?\\nBut the problem doesn't specify.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the equation $ \\\\sum 1/k_i =1 $ with $ k_i=1 $ is acceptable.\\n\\nI think n=1 is valid.\\n\\nBut let's suppose the problem meant $ k_i \\\\geq 2 $. Then $ 1/k_i \\\\leq 1/2 $, so sum ≤ n/2, so to have sum=1, need n≥2.\\nBut even then, n=1 would be invalid.\\nBut the problem does not say that.\\n\\nWait — in the sum $ \\\\sum 1/k_i =1 $, if one $ k_i=1 $, then all other reciprocals must be zero, impossible unless n=1.\\nSo only in n=1 can we have k_i=1.\\nBut again, it's valid.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem intends for the $ k_i $ to be greater than 1, but it doesn't state it.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe \\\"part size\\\" means the common size in a uniform partition? But in n=1, it's trivial.\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"derived from the structural consideration of minimal number of terms\\\" — which is exactly what we did.\\n\\nSo I think answer is 2022.\\n\\nBut let's see Problem 2.\\n\\n---\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nAlice and Bob play on a row of 2022 squares. They place tiles covering two adjacent squares. Alice goes first. Tiles cannot overlap. Game ends when no more tiles can be placed. Alice wants to maximize uncovered squares; Bob wants to minimize it. We are to find the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure, regardless of Bob's play.\\n\\nThis is a combinatorial game theory problem.\\n\\nTotal squares: 2022 (even).\\nEach tile covers 2 squares.\\nMaximum number of tiles: 1011, covering all.\\nMinimum: could be less due to blocking.\\n\\nUncovered squares = 2022 − 2×(number of tiles placed)\\nSo to maximize uncovered, Alice wants to minimize number of tiles; Bob wants to maximize number of tiles (to minimize uncovered).\\nWait: uncovered = total − 2t, where t is number of tiles.\\nBob wants to minimize uncovered → maximize t.\\nAlice wants to maximize uncovered → minimize t.\\nSo Alice tries to block the board early; Bob tries to keep it open.\\n\\nBut they alternate placing dominoes (each covering two adjacent squares).\\nAlice moves first.\\n\\nWe are to find the maximum number of uncovered squares that Alice can **ensure**, no matter how Bob plays. That is, the value of the game when Alice plays optimally against adversarial Bob.\\n\\nThis is similar to known tiling games.\\n\\nKnown idea: if the board is long, players can block regions.\\n\\nA key idea is to use pairing strategies.\\n\\nBob might try to mirror or pair cells.\\n\\nBut Alice moves first and wants to leave many uncovered.\\n\\nNote: at the end, the board has some covered dominoes and some isolated squares that cannot be covered because their neighbors are taken.\\n\\nAn important observation: the final position will consist of covered dominoes and uncovered squares that are isolated (both neighbors covered or boundary).\\n\\nBut the structure depends on placement.\\n\\nKnown result: in such a game on a 1×n board, with two players alternately placing dominoes, Alice trying to maximize uncovered, Bob to minimize, the outcome can be analyzed via strategy stealing or pairing.\\n\\nBut let's think.\\n\\nSuppose Bob can always ensure that at least half the board is covered? Not necessarily.\\n\\nAnother idea: the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed is limited by the arrangement.\\n\\nBut Alice can try to create isolated single squares early.\\n\\nFor example, if Alice places a domino in the middle, she splits the board into two independent segments.\\nBut that might help Bob play in both.\\n\\nAlternatively, Alice might place a domino near the end, but that just reduces the length.\\n\\nBetter idea: Alice can aim to create an odd-length segment, which forces at least one uncovered square.\\n\\nBut Bob can also act.\\n\\nLet’s consider small cases.\\n\\nLet f(n) be the maximum number of uncovered squares that Alice can guarantee on a 1×n board.\\n\\nBut it's a two-player game, alternating, Alice first.\\n\\nWe can define V(n) as the value: the number of uncovered squares when both play optimally, Alice maximizing, Bob minimizing.\\n\\nWe want V(2022).\\n\\nBase cases:\\n- n=0: 0 uncovered\\n- n=1: no move possible, 1 uncovered\\n- n=2: Alice must place the only domino → 0 uncovered\\n- n=3: possible moves:\\n  - Alice can place domino on left (covers 1,2), leaves square 3 → Bob cannot move → game ends, 1 uncovered\\n  - or cover (2,3), leaves 1 → 1 uncovered\\n  - cannot cover non-adjacent\\n  So Alice gets 1 uncovered. Bob has no choice. So V(3)=1\\n- n=4:\\n  Alice moves first.\\n  Options:\\n  a) Place domino at end: say positions 1-2. Leaves 3-4, which is a segment of length 2. Bob places domino there → all covered → 0 uncovered\\n  b) Place in middle: 2-3. Then left: square 1 and square 4, separated. No two adjacent uncovered → Bob cannot move. Game ends. Uncovered: 1 and 4 → 2 uncovered\\n  So Alice can choose to place in middle and get 2 uncovered.\\n  So V(4)=2\\n\\nBut Bob wants to minimize uncovered, but he only moves after Alice. In this case, after Alice places in middle, Bob cannot move, so game ends.\\nSo Alice can force 2 uncovered.\\nSo V(4)=2\\n\\nn=5:\\nAlice moves:\\nOption 1: place at end, say 1-2. Leaves 3-4-5, a segment of length 3.\\nNow Bob plays on this. From above, V(3)=1, meaning that the player to move (Bob) on length 3 will allow 1 uncovered? Wait — but Bob is now playing on a subgame, but his objective is global: minimize total uncovered.\\nSince the segments are independent, we can analyze additively.\\nAfter Alice places 1-2, board has [1-2] covered, and [3-4-5] free.\\nBob moves on [3-4-5]. On a 3-board, the first player (Bob) can force only 1 uncovered? But Bob wants to minimize uncovered, so he wants to cover as much as possible.\\nOn n=3, if Bob plays, he can cover two squares, leaving one uncovered — best he can do. So uncovered in that segment: 1.\\nTotal uncovered: 1 (from 3-4-5) → total uncovered = 1\\n\\nOption 2: Alice places at 2-3. Then covered: 2-3. Left: square 1, and segment 4-5.\\nNow Bob can place on 4-5 (covers them). Then only square 1 uncovered → total uncovered =1\\n\\nOption 3: Alice places at 3-4. Similar to above: leaves 1-2 and 5. Bob covers 1-2, leaves 5 → uncovered=1\\n\\nOption 4: Alice places at 4-5: symmetric to option 1. Bob faces 1-2-3, can cover two, leave one → uncovered=1\\n\\nBut can Alice do better?\\nWhat if Alice places at 1-2: as above, Bob plays on 3-4-5, covers two, leaves one → uncovered=1\\nAll options give at most 1 uncovered?\\nBut earlier I thought placing in middle, but on n=5, middle dominoes don’t isolate both ends.\\nWait — is there a way to get more?\\nSuppose Alice places at 1-2: Bob plays on 3-4-5. Bob can cover 3-4, leave 5; or 4-5, leave 3. Either way, one uncovered. Total uncovered:1\\nSimilarly for others.\\nCan Alice force 2?\\nSuppose Alice places at 2-3: covers 2-3, leaves 1 and 4-5.\\nBob can cover 4-5, then 1 is isolated → uncovered=1\\nSame if Alice places 3-4: Bob covers 1-2, leaves 5 → uncovered=1\\nIf Alice places 1-2: Bob plays on remaining 3-4-5: he can place 3-4, leaving 5; or 4-5, leaving 3. After that, no more moves. So only one uncovered.\\nSo all moves lead to 1 uncovered.\\nSo V(5)=1?\\nBut Alice cannot force more than 1.\\nBut is there a move where Bob is forced to leave more?\\nNo, Bob will always cover as much as possible.\\nSo V(5)=1\\n\\nBut earlier n=4, Alice could force 2.\\n\\nn=6:\\nAlice moves.\\nOptions:\\n1. Alice places at end: 1-2. Leaves 3-4-5-6 (length 4).\\nNow Bob plays on length 4. What is V(4)? But Bob is now the first player on a 4-board. But Bob wants to minimize uncovered, so he would play optimally to minimize uncovered in the whole game.\\nFrom earlier, on a 4-board, the first player (if both play optimally) can force 2 uncovered? But that was when the first player is Alice (maximizer). Now Bob is minimizer.\\nAh! Important: the value depends on who starts.\\n\\nDefine:\\nLet A(n) = number of uncovered squares when first player is Alice (maximizer), second is Bob (minimizer), both optimal.\\nBut actually, the roles are fixed: Alice always wants to maximize uncovered, Bob to minimize, regardless of turn.\\nBut the starting player alternates per component?\\nNo — it's a single game, turns alternate globally.\\n\\nBetter to define F(n) = the number of uncovered squares at the end when both play optimally on a 1×n board, with the current player to move being either Alice or Bob depending on turn.\\nBut since the objectives are opposite, and turn order matters, we need to define two functions:\\nLet V(n, P) where P is the player to move, but it's complicated.\\n\\nSince Alice always wants to maximize uncovered, Bob to minimize, and they alternate, with Alice starting.\\n\\nDefine f(n) = the number of uncovered squares when both play optimally on a 1×n board, Alice moving first, Alice maximizing uncovered, Bob minimizing.\\n\\nWe want f(2022).\\n\\nFrom earlier:\\nf(0) = 0\\nf(1) = 1 (no move)\\nf(2): Alice must place the domino → 0 uncovered → f(2)=0\\nf(3): Alice places a domino, say at 1-2 or 2-3, leaves one square → f(3)=1\\nf(4): Alice can place at 2-3 (middle), splitting into two singles. Then Bob cannot move. So uncovered = 2 → f(4)=2\\nf(5): as above, whatever Alice does, Bob can respond to limit uncovered to 1. So f(5)=1\\nf(6):\\nAlice moves.\\nOptions:\\na) Place at end: 1-2. Leaves 3-4-5-6 (length 4), Bob to move.\\nNow Bob is playing on a 4-board, but Bob wants to minimize uncovered. What is the outcome when Bob is the first player on a 4-board?\\nCall g(n) = uncovered when the minimizer (Bob) starts on a 1×n board.\\nBut to avoid confusion, let’s define:\\nLet M(n) = max uncovered when maximizer (Alice) starts on 1×n\\nLet m(n) = max uncovered when minimizer (Bob) starts on 1×n\\nBut “max uncovered” is from Alice’s view, but when Bob starts, he wants to minimize, so the value is determined by Bob’s optimal play.\\n\\nDefine:\\nLet A(n) = number of uncovered squares when the current player is Alice (and she wants to maximize uncovered), and both play optimally thereafter.\\nB(n) = number of uncovered squares when the current player is Bob (and he wants to minimize uncovered), and both play optimally.\\n\\nBut the game may split into components. When the board is disconnected, the game is the sum of independent games. Since the players choose which component to play in, we need to consider disjunctive sum.\\n\\nHowever, in this game, a move is placing a domino on two adjacent uncovered squares. If the board is split into separate segments, the player can choose which segment to play in.\\n\\nSo the game is the sum of its connected components.\\n\\nThe overall uncovered squares is the sum over components of their uncovered squares.\\n\\nWhen a player moves, they choose a component and make a move in it, possibly splitting it further.\\n\\nSo we can define the value recursively, considering all possible moves.\\n\\nBut it might be complex.\\n\\nKnown result: in such a game, the first player can force at least n mod 2 uncovered, but here Alice can do better.\\n\\nFrom our calculations:\\nA(0) = 0\\nA(1) = 1 (no move)\\nA(2): only move: place domino → no uncovered → A(2)=0\\nA(3): Alice places domino, leaves one square → A(3)=1\\nA(4): Alice can place at position 2-3, leaving squares 1 and 4 isolated. Then Bob cannot move. So uncovered = 2 → A(4)=2\\nA(5): Alice must place a domino. Any placement:\\n- End: 1-2, leaves 3-4-5. This is a single segment of length 3, Bob to move.\\n  When Bob moves on length 3, he will place a domino, say 3-4, leaving 5; or 4-5, leaving 3. Either way, one square left. So total uncovered =1\\n- Middle: 2-3, leaves square 1 and segment 4-5. Bob can place on 4-5, covering them. Then only square 1 uncovered → uncovered=1\\nSimilarly for 3-4: Bob covers 1-2, leaves 5 → uncovered=1\\nSo in all cases, uncovered=1 → A(5)=1\\nA(6):\\nAlice moves.\\nOption 1: Place at 1-2. Leaves 3-4-5-6 (length 4), Bob to move.\\nNow Bob is to move on a length 4 board. Let B(4) be the uncovered squares when Bob starts on length 4.\\nBob wants to minimize uncovered.\\nBob has choices:\\n- Place at end: 3-4, leaves 5-6. Then Alice will move on 5-6: she can cover it (only move), so 0 uncovered from that. But after Bob covers 3-4, segment 5-6 remains, Alice covers it. So all covered? uncovered=0\\n- Place at 4-5 (middle), covers 4-5, leaves 3 and 6. Then Alice cannot move. uncovered=2\\nBut Bob wants to minimize uncovered, so he will choose to place at end (3-4 or 5-6), leading to uncovered=0, rather than middle which gives 2.\\nSo Bob will place at end, say 3-4, then Alice covers 5-6 → all covered → uncovered=0\\nSo if Alice places at 1-2, then Bob can force uncovered=0 in the rest, so total uncovered=0\\nOption 2: Alice places at 2-3. Covers 2-3, leaves square 1 and segment 4-5-6.\\nBob now moves. He can play on 4-5-6.\\nOn a length 3, Bob (minimizer) will place a domino, say 4-5, leaving 6; or 5-6, leaving 4. Either way, one uncovered from that segment. Plus square 1 uncovered. Total uncovered=2\\nCould Bob do better? No, he can only cover two, leave one.\\nSo uncovered=2\\nOption 3: Alice places at 3-4 (center). Covers 3-4, leaves 1-2 and 5-6.\\nTwo separate domino spots.\\nBob must move. He can cover 1-2 or 5-6, say 1-2. Then Alice covers 5-6. All covered? uncovered=0\\nOr Bob covers 5-6, Alice covers 1-2. Still uncovered=0\\nSo Bob can force uncovered=0\\nOption 4: Alice places at 4-5: symmetric to option 2, uncovered=2\\nOption 5: Alice places at 5-6: symmetric to option 1, Bob can force uncovered=0\\nSo Alice's choices:\\n- Place at end or center: leads to uncovered=0 (if Bob plays well)\\n- Place at 2-3 or 4-5: leads to uncovered=2\\nSo Alice will choose to place at 2-3 or 4-5 to get 2 uncovered.\\nSo A(6)=2\\n\\nBut earlier I thought placing at 2-3 gives uncovered=2, yes.\\nSo f(6)=2\\n\\nNow pattern:\\nn | f(n)\\n1 | 1\\n2 | 0\\n3 | 1\\n4 | 2\\n5 | 1\\n6 | 2\\n\\nf(7):\\nAlice moves.\\nShe can try to split.\\nSuppose she places at 3-4. Then leaves 1-2 and 5-6-7.\\nBob can cover 1-2, then we have 5-6-7 with Alice to move.\\nA(3)=1, so Alice will leave 1 uncovered there. Total uncovered=1 (from 5-6-7)\\nTotal uncovered=1\\nSuppose Alice places at 1-2. Leaves 3-4-5-6-7 (length 5), Bob to move.\\nB(5): Bob starts on length 5.\\nBob wants to minimize uncovered.\\nBob can place at 3-4, leaves 5-6-7 and square 2? No: board is 3,4,5,6,7.\\nPositions: 3-4-5-6-7\\nBob places:\\n- At end: 3-4, leaves 5-6-7. Then Alice moves on 5-6-7: A(3)=1, so 1 uncovered\\n- At 4-5, leaves 3 and 6-7. Alice covers 6-7, leaves 3 → uncovered=1\\n- At 5-6, leaves 3-4 and 7. Alice covers 3-4, leaves 7 → uncovered=1\\nSo in all cases, uncovered=1\\nSo if Alice places at 1-2, total uncovered=1\\nSuppose Alice places at 2-3. Covers 2-3, leaves 1 and 4-5-6-7.\\nBob moves on 4-5-6-7 (length 4).\\nBob starts on length 4. As before, Bob can place at end, say 4-5, leaves 6-7. Alice covers 6-7. Or Bob places at 5-6, leaves 4 and 7, then Alice cannot move, uncovered=2. But Bob wants to minimize, so he will not do that. He will place at end: 4-5, then Alice covers 6-7; or 6-7, then Alice covers 4-5. In either case, all covered in that segment. So uncovered only from square 1 → total uncovered=1\\nSimilarly, if Alice places elsewhere.\\nCan Alice get more than 1?\\nSuppose she places at 3-4, as before, leads to 1.\\nOr at 1-2, leads to 1.\\nWhat if she places at 4-5? Covers 4-5, leaves 1-2-3 and 6-7.\\nBob can cover 1-2, then Alice covers 6-7, and 3 is left? After Bob covers 1-2, segment 3 is isolated, 6-7 is there. Alice can cover 6-7. Then square 3 uncovered. Total uncovered=1\\nBob could cover 6-7 first, same thing.\\nSo seems f(7)=1\\n\\nPattern so far: f(1)=1, f(2)=0, f(3)=1, f(4)=2, f(5)=1, f(6)=2, f(7)=1\\n\\nf(8):\\nAlice can try to place at 4-5 (center), covers 4-5, leaves 1-2-3 and 6-7-8.\\nTwo segments of length 3.\\nBob moves. He must choose one segment, say 1-2-3, and place a domino there, say 1-2, leaving 3; or 2-3, leaving 1. Then Alice moves on the other segment 6-7-8, similarly leaves one uncovered. So total uncovered=2 (one from each)\\nIf Bob plays on one, Alice plays on the other.\\nSo uncovered=2\\nCan Bob do better? No, he can only reduce one segment.\\nAfter Bob moves on one length-3, Alice moves on the other, each time leaving one square.\\nSo total uncovered=2\\nCan Alice get more?\\nSuppose Alice places at 3-4. Covers 3-4, leaves 1-2 and 5-6-7-8.\\nBob can cover 1-2, then we have 5-6-7-8 with Alice to move.\\nA(4)=2, so Alice can force 2 uncovered there. Total uncovered=2\\nSame as before.\\nIf Alice places at 2-3: covers 2-3, leaves 1 and 4-5-6-7-8 (length 5)\\nBob moves on length 5. As before, B(5) leads to 1 uncovered in that segment. Plus square 1, total uncovered=2\\nSimilarly, other moves.\\nCan Alice force 3?\\nSuppose she places at 1-2: leaves length 6, Bob to move.\\nB(6): Bob starts on length 6.\\nBob wants to minimize uncovered.\\nWhat can he do?\\nHe might place at 3-4, leaving 1-2? No, 1-2 is already covered? Board is positions 3,4,5,6,7,8? No: after Alice covers 1-2, board is 3-4-5-6-7-8\\nBob can:\\n- Place at 3-4, leaves 5-6-7-8. Alice moves on A(4)=2, so 2 uncovered\\n- Place at 4-5, leaves 3 and 6-7-8. Alice can cover 6-7 or 7-8? Segment 6-7-8, Alice can place at 6-7, leave 8; or 7-8, leave 6. Then uncovered: 3 and one more → total 2\\n- Place at 5-6, similar\\n- Place at end 7-8, leaves 3-4-5-6. Alice on A(4)=2 → 2 uncovered\\nSo in all cases, uncovered=2\\nSo total uncovered=2\\nSo f(8)=2\\n\\nBut earlier with center move, also 2.\\n\\nSo f(8)=2\\n\\nNow list:\\nn: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\\nf(n):1 0 1 2 1 2 1 2\\n\\nIt seems that for n≥2, f(n) = 2 if n even, 1 if n odd? But f(2)=0, not 2.\\nf(4)=2, f(6)=2, f(8)=2, f(3)=1, f(5)=1, f(7)=1\\nf(2)=0 is exception.\\n\\nf(2)=0, but f(4)=2, etc.\\n\\nFor n even, n≥4, f(n)=2? But f(6)=2, f(8)=2, but is it constant?\\n\\nf(9):\\nAlice moves.\\nSuppose she places at end, 1-2. Leaves length 7, Bob to move.\\nB(7): Bob on length 7.\\nBob wants to minimize uncovered.\\nHe can try to reduce.\\nSuppose Bob places at 3-4, leaves 5-6-7-8-9 (length 5) and 1-2 covered, but segment 5-9.\\nThen Alice on A(5)=1, so 1 uncovered.\\nBut also, after Bob covers 3-4, board has 5-6-7-8-9, Alice to move, f(5)=1.\\nSo uncovered=1\\nIf Bob places elsewhere, likely same.\\nSo uncovered=1\\nIf Alice places in middle, say 4-5, leaves 1-2-3 and 6-7-8-9.\\nBob can cover 1-2, then Alice on 6-7-8-9: A(4)=2, so 2 uncovered\\nOr Bob covers on the right, etc.\\nBut Bob will choose to minimize.\\nAfter Alice covers 4-5, segments: left length 3, right length 4.\\nBob can choose to play on the right (length 4). On length 4, if Bob is first player, what happens?\\nBob on length 4: he can place at end, say 6-7, leaves 8-9. Alice covers 8-9. uncovered=0 in that segment.\\nOr if he places at 7-8, leaves 6 and 9, then Alice cannot move, uncovered=2, but Bob won't do that.\\nSo Bob places at end, forces 0 uncovered on right.\\nThen left segment 1-2-3, Alice to move: A(3)=1, so 1 uncovered.\\nTotal uncovered=1\\nIf Bob plays on left first: covers two on left, say 1-2, leaves 3. Then right segment 6-7-8-9, Alice to move: A(4)=2, so 2 uncovered. Total=3, worse for Bob.\\nSo Bob will prefer to play on the right and force only 1 uncovered.\\nSo total uncovered=1\\nOther moves by Alice likely lead to 1.\\nSo f(9)=1\\n\\nSimilarly, f(n) = 1 for odd n, 2 for even n≥4, except f(2)=0\\n\\nBut f(2)=0, f(4)=2, f(6)=2, f(8)=2\\n\\nNow n=2022, which is even, greater than 4, so f(2022)=2?\\n\\nBut is that possible? Can Alice really only force 2 uncovered?\\n\\nBut in f(4), she forces 2; in f(6), she forces 2; but for larger n, can she force more?\\n\\nPerhaps the value is bounded.\\n\\nAnother idea: Bob can always ensure that at most 2 squares are uncovered, by using a pairing strategy.\\n\\nFor example, Bob can mentally pair the squares as (1,2), (3,4), ..., (2021,2022). There are 1011 pairs.\\nWhenever Alice plays on a pair, Bob can play on another, but if Alice plays across pairs, it messes up.\\n\\nSuppose Bob uses the following strategy: whenever possible, respond in a way that maintains symmetry or pairing.\\n\\nBut Alice can break symmetry.\\n\\nKnown result in such games: the minimizer can often force the uncovered squares to be at most 2.\\n\\nFrom our calculation, for even n≥4, f(n)=2, for odd n≥3, f(n)=1, f(2)=0\\n\\nBut f(2)=0 is exact.\\n\\nFor n=2022, even, >=4, so f(n)=2\\n\\nBut let's check f(10)\\nAlice moves.\\nSuppose she places at 5-6 (center), covers 5-6, leaves two segments of length 4: 1-4 and 7-10.\\nBob moves. He must choose one, say 1-4, and play.\\nIf Bob plays on 1-4, he might place at 1-2, then Alice on the other segment 7-10 can place at 8-9 (middle), leaving 7 and 10 uncovered, and also 3-4 might be coverable? After Bob covers 1-2, segment 3-4 is still there. Alice could cover 3-4, but she wants to maximize uncovered, so she might not.\\nAfter Bob covers 1-2 in left segment, the left segment has 3-4 uncovered. Alice could choose to play there or on the right.\\nBut Alice wants to maximize uncovered, so she might play on the right segment 7-10.\\nOn 7-10, she can place at 8-9, leaving 7 and 10 uncovered. Then later, 3-4 can be covered by Bob? But after Alice places at 8-9, Bob can cover 3-4. Then no more moves. Uncovered: 7 and 10 → 2\\nIf after Bob covers 1-2, Alice covers 3-4, then Bob can play on 7-10, and if he covers 7-8, Alice covers 9-10, all covered; or Bob can place at 8-9, leaving 7 and 10, but Bob won't do that.\\nBob will cover 7-8 or 9-10, then Alice covers the other.\\nSo uncovered=0 in right if Bob plays properly.\\nBut in this line, after Alice's initial move, Bob plays on left, covers 1-2, then Alice can play on right and place at 8-9, leaving 7 and 10. Then Bob can cover 3-4. So uncovered=2\\nTotal uncovered=2\\nIf Bob, after Alice's first move (covering 5-6), chooses to play on a different way.\\nBut anyway, uncovered=2\\nCan Alice force 4?\\nSuppose she places at 1-2. Leaves 3-10, length 8, Bob to move.\\nBob on length 8.\\nBob can try to minimize.\\nSuppose Bob places at 3-4, leaves 5-10.\\nThen Alice on 5-10, length 6, A(6)=2, so 2 uncovered\\nTotal uncovered=2\\nIf Bob places at 4-5, leaves 3 and 6-10 (length 5)\\nThen Alice can play on 6-10: A(5)=1, so 1 uncovered, plus 3, total 2\\nSo still 2\\nSo seems capped at 2\\n\\nTherefore, for n>=4 even, f(n)=2\\nFor n odd >=3, f(n)=1\\nFor n=2, f(n)=0\\nFor n=1, f(n)=1\\n\\nSo for n=2022, which is even and greater than 4, f(2022)=2\\n\\nThus Alice can ensure 2 uncovered squares.\\n\\nBut is that the maximum she can ensure? Yes, because Bob can prevent more than 2.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 2 is 2.\\n\\nBut let's confirm with another source or logic.\\n\\nGeneral strategy: Bob can ensure that the number of uncovered squares is at most 2 by maintaining connectivity or using pairing.\\n\\nBut from the pattern, it holds.\\n\\nSo Problem 1: e = 2022\\nProblem 2: 2\\n\\nBut in Problem 1, is n=1 really accepted?\\n\\nReconsider: the problem says \\\"positive integers n, k_1, ..., k_n\\\" and for n=1, k_1=1, sum=1=5*1-4=1, and 1/1=1, so it satisfies.\\nAnd it has the smallest n=1.\\nThen k=1, e=1+2021=2022\\n\\nPerhaps the problem intends for k_i >=2, but it doesn't say.\\n\\nMaybe \\\"part size\\\" means something else, like the size in a regular partition, but no.\\n\\nOr perhaps in the context, n must be at least 2, but no justification.\\n\\nGiven the math, I think 2022 is correct.\\n\\nSo final answers:\\nProblem 1: 2022\\nProblem 2: 2\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2022\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\"\n}",
