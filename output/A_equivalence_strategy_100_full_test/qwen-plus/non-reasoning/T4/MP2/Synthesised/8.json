So symmetric.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Use identity (1) to express $f(x^3)$\n\nFrom (1): $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x) + f(0)$\n\nLet us suppose that $f$ is a polynomial. This is a common technique.\n\nAssume $f(x) = a_n x^n + \\cdots + a_0$\n\nThen $f(x^3) = a_n x^{3n} + \\cdots + a_0$\n\nAnd $x^2 f(x) = x^2(a_n x^n + \\cdots) = a_n x^{n+2} + \\cdots$\n\nSo $f(x^3) - x^2 f(x) = f(0)$, a constant.\n\nSo the difference $f(x^3) - x^2 f(x)$ is constant.\n\nLet’s analyze degrees.\n\nSuppose $f$ has degree $n$. Then:\n\n- $f(x^3)$ has degree $3n$\n- $x^2 f(x)$ has degree $n + 2$\n\nFor their difference to be constant, either:\n\n- $3n = n + 2$ → $2n = 2$ → $n = 1$, or\n- $3n < n + 2$ → $2n < 2$ → $n < 1$, so $n = 0$\n- Or $3n > n + 2$ but then leading term must cancel — but they are different powers unless $3n = n + 2$\n\nWait: $f(x^3)$ and $x^2 f(x)$ are generally polynomials in different monomials unless $3n = n + 2$, i.e., $n = 1$\n\nTry $n = 1$: let $f(x) = ax + b$\n\nThen compute $f(x^3) = a x^3 + b$\n\n$x^2 f(x) = x^2(ax + b) = a x^3 + b x^2$\n\nThen $f(x^3) - x^2 f(x) = (a x^3 + b) - (a x^3 + b x^2) = -b x^2 + b$\n\nThis equals $f(0) = b$ only if $-b x^2 + b = b$ for all $x$, so $-b x^2 = 0$ ⇒ $b = 0$\n\nSo $f(x) = ax$, and $f(0) = 0$, so $k = f(0) + 1 = 1$\n\nNow check if this works in original equation.\n\nLet $f(x) = ax$\n\nLHS: $f(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = a(x^3 + y^3 + xy)$\n\nRHS: $x^2 f(x) + y^2 f(y) + f(xy) = x^2 (a x) + y^2 (a y) + a (xy) = a x^3 + a y^3 + a xy$\n\nSo RHS = $a(x^3 + y^3 + xy)$ = LHS\n\nPerfect! So all linear functions $f(x) = ax$ satisfy the equation.\n\nThus $f(0) = 0$, so $k = 0 + 1 = 1$\n\nBut wait — are there other solutions?\n\nEarlier we assumed polynomial. But maybe there are others.\n\nBut from identity (1): $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x) + f(0)$\n\nLet $g(x) = f(x) - f(0)$. Then $g(0) = 0$\n\nThen $f(x) = g(x) + c$, where $c = f(0)$\n\nPlug into (1):\n\n$f(x^3) = x^2 f(x) + c$\n\nSo $g(x^3) + c = x^2 (g(x) + c) + c = x^2 g(x) + c x^2 + c$\n\nThus:\n$g(x^3) + c = x^2 g(x) + c x^2 + c$\n\nSubtract $c$:\n$g(x^3) = x^2 g(x) + c x^2$\n\nSo:\n$g(x^3) = x^2 (g(x) + c)$\n\nIf $c = 0$, then $g(x^3) = x^2 g(x)$, and $g(0) = 0$\n\nAnd earlier, with $f(x) = ax$, we had $g(x) = ax$, $c = 0$, and it works.\n\nSuppose $c \\ne 0$, say $f(0) = c \\ne 0$\n\nThen $g(x^3) = x^2 g(x) + c x^2 = x^2 (g(x) + c)$\n\nNow go back to original equation.\n\nSet $x = y$\n\nThen LHS: $f(x^3 + x^3 + x \\cdot x) = f(2x^3 + x^2)$\n\nRHS: $x^2 f(x) + x^2 f(x) + f(x^2) = 2x^2 f(x) + f(x^2)$\n\nSo:\n$f(2x^3 + x^2) = 2x^2 f(x) + f(x^2)$\n\nNow try $x = 1$\n\nThen:\n$f(2 + 1) = f(3) = 2 f(1) + f(1) = 3 f(1)$? Wait no:\n\nWait $x = 1$: LHS: $f(2(1)^3 + (1)^2) = f(3)$\n\nRHS: $2(1)^2 f(1) + f(1^2) = 2 f(1) + f(1) = 3 f(1)$\n\nSo $f(3) = 3 f(1)$\n\nSimilarly, try $x = -1$\n\nLHS: $f(2(-1)^3 + (-1)^2) = f(-2 + 1) = f(-1)$\n\nRHS: $2(-1)^2 f(-1) + f(1) = 2 f(-1) + f(1)$\n\nSo:\n$f(-1) = 2 f(-1) + f(1)$ ⇒ $-f(-1) = f(1)$ ⇒ $f(-1) = -f(1)$\n\nInteresting.\n\nNow try $x = 1, y = -1$\n\nCompute argument: $x^3 + y^3 + xy = 1 - 1 + (1)(-1) = 0 - 1 = -1$\n\nLHS: $f(-1)$\n\nRHS: $1^2 f(1) + (-1)^2 f(-1) + f((1)(-1)) = f(1) + f(-1) + f(-1) = f(1) + 2 f(-1)$\n\nBut $f(-1) = -f(1)$, so RHS: $f(1) + 2(-f(1)) = f(1) - 2f(1) = -f(1)$\n\nLHS: $f(-1) = -f(1)$\n\nSo matches.\n\nStill consistent.\n\nBut does this rule out non-zero $f(0)$?\n\nGo back to equation (1): $f(x^3) = x^2 f(x) + f(0)$\n\nTry $x = 0$: $f(0) = 0 + f(0)$, ok.\n\nTry $x = 1$: $f(1) = 1 \\cdot f(1) + f(0)$ ⇒ $f(1) = f(1) + f(0)$ ⇒ $f(0) = 0$\n\nAh! Here it is!\n\nFrom (1), set $x = 1$:\n\n$f(1^3) = 1^2 f(1) + f(0)$ ⇒ $f(1) = f(1) + f(0)$ ⇒ $f(0) = 0$\n\nTherefore, **any solution must have** $f(0) = 0$\n\nHence $k = f(0) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$\n\nSo regardless of what $f$ is, $f(0) = 0$, so $k = 1$\n\nThus, $k = 1$\n\n---\n\nNow, second part of the problem:\n\n> Find a sequence of maximal length consisting of non-zero integers in which the sum of any seven consecutive terms starting from position $i = k$ onwards is positive and that of any eleven consecutive terms starting from position $i = k$ onwards is negative.\n\nWe found $k = 1$, so \"starting from position $i = 1$ onwards\".\n\nSo we want a sequence $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ of non-zero integers such that:\n\n- For every $i \\geq 1$ such that $i+6 \\leq n$, the sum $a_i + a_{i+1} + \\cdots + a_{i+6} > 0$\n- For every $i \\geq 1$ such that $i+10 \\leq n$, the sum $a_i + \\cdots + a_{i+10} < 0$\n- All $a_j \\ne 0$\n- Maximize $n$, the length\n\nWe are to find such a sequence of **maximal length**\n\nThis is a classic type of extremal sequence problem involving overlapping sums.\n\nLet $S_7(i) = \\sum_{j=i}^{i+6} a_j > 0$ for all $i$ such that $i+6 \\leq n$\n\n$S_{11}(i) = \\sum_{j=i}^{i+10} a_j < 0$ for all $i$ such that $i+10 \\leq n$\n\nWe want the longest possible $n$\n\nThis resembles known problems (e.g., Putnam-style).\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nLet $A = S_7(1) = a_1 + \\cdots + a_7 > 0$\n\n$S_7(2) > 0$, ..., up to $S_7(n-6) > 0$\n\nSimilarly, $S_{11}(1) < 0$, ..., $S_{11}(n-10) < 0$\n\nNote: The 11-sums are negative, 7-sums are positive.\n\nWe can relate them.\n\nFor example, $S_{11}(1) = S_7(1) + a_8 + a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11}$\n\nSimilarly, $S_{11}(2) = S_7(2) + a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11} + a_{12}$\n\nBut more useful: consider differences.\n\nLet’s suppose the sequence has length $n$. We want the maximum $n$ such that:\n\n- All 7-consecutive sums from start are positive\n- All 11-consecutive sums from start are negative\n\nKnown result: In such problems, the maximal length is bounded by $7 + 11 - \\gcd(7,11) = 18 - 1 = 17$, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use an argument by contradiction.\n\nSuppose such a sequence exists of length $n$\n\nLet $T = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$\n\nBut perhaps better to consider overlapping.\n\nLet’s define $s_i = a_i$\n\nLet $P_i = s_i + s_{i+1} + \\cdots + s_{i+6} > 0$ for $i = 1$ to $n-6$\n\n$Q_i = s_i + \\cdots + s_{i+10} < 0$ for $i = 1$ to $n-10$\n\nNow, note that $Q_i = P_i + P_{i+1} + P_{i+2} + P_{i+3} + P_{i+4} - (s_{i+7} + s_{i+8} + s_{i+9} + s_{i+10})$ — messy.\n\nBetter idea: consider summing all $P_i$ and all $Q_i$\n\nLet $A = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-6} P_i$\n\nEach $P_i > 0$, so $A > 0$\n\nEach $a_j$ appears in $P_i$ for how many $i$?\n\n$a_j$ appears in $P_i$ when $i \\leq j \\leq i+6$ ⇒ $j-6 \\leq i \\leq j$, and $1 \\leq i \\leq n-6$\n\nSo number of times $a_j$ appears is number of $i$ such that $\\max(1, j-6) \\leq i \\leq \\min(n-6, j)$\n\nSimilarly for $Q_i$\n\nBut perhaps instead, use a standard result.\n\nThis is similar to a known problem: \n\n> What is the maximum length of a sequence such that every 7 consecutive terms have positive sum and every 11 consecutive terms have negative sum?\n\nAnswer is $7 + 11 - 2 = 16$? Or $17$?\n\nActually, a well-known result in combinatorics: if every $m$-consecutive sum is positive and every $n$-consecutive sum is negative, then the maximal length is $m + n - \\gcd(m,n) - 1$ or something.\n\nBut let's think constructively.\n\nSuppose $n \\geq 17$\n\nConsider the 11-sum starting at $i=1$: $Q_1 = a_1 + \\cdots + a_{11} < 0$\n\nThe 7-sums within:\n\n$P_1 = a_1+\\cdots+a_7 > 0$\n\n$P_2 = a_2+\\cdots+a_8 > 0$\n\n...\n\n$P_5 = a_5+\\cdots+a_{11} > 0$\n\nThere are 5 such 7-sums fully contained in $Q_1$: $P_1$ to $P_5$\n\nBut $Q_1 = a_1 + \\cdots + a_{11} = P_1 + a_8 + a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11}$\n\nBut $a_8 + a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11} = P_8$? No.\n\nNote:\n\n$Q_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{11} a_i$\n\nAlso, $P_1 + P_2 + \\cdots + P_5 = \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\sum_{j=i}^{i+6} a_j$\n\nHow many times does each $a_k$ appear?\n\nFor $a_1$: only in $P_1$\n\n$a_2$: $P_1, P_2$\n\n...\n\n$a_7$: $P_1$ to $P_5$? $P_1$ includes $a_7$, $P_2$ includes $a_7$, ..., $P_5$ includes $a_7$? $P_5 = a_5$ to $a_{11}$, yes $a_7$ included.\n\nActually:\n\n- $a_1$: only $P_1$\n- $a_2$: $P_1, P_2$\n- $a_3$: $P_1,P_2,P_3$\n- $a_4$: $P_1$ to $P_4$\n- $a_5$: $P_1$ to $P_5$\n- $a_6$: $P_1$ to $P_5$? $P_1$: up to $a_7$, yes; $P_5$: starts at $a_5$, so $a_6$ included — yes\n- $a_7$: $P_1$ to $P_5$ — yes\n- $a_8$: $P_2$ to $P_5$? $P_2 = a_2$ to $a_8$, yes; $P_5 = a_5$ to $a_{11}$, yes — so $P_2,P_3,P_4,P_5$: 4 times\n- $a_9$: $P_3,P_4,P_5$: 3 times\n- $a_{10}$: $P_4,P_5$: 2 times\n- $a_{11}$: $P_5$: 1 time\n\nSo total sum $S = P_1 + \\cdots + P_5 = 1a_1 + 2a_2 + 3a_3 + 4a_4 + 5a_5 + 5a_6 + 5a_7 + 4a_8 + 3a_9 + 2a_{10} + 1a_{11}$\n\nBut $Q_1 = a_1 + \\cdots + a_{11}$\n\nSo $S - 5 Q_1 = (1-5)a_1 + (2-5)a_2 + (3-5)a_3 + (4-5)a_4 + (5-5)(a_5+a_6+a_7) + (4-5)a_8 + (3-5)a_9 + (2-5)a_{10} + (1-5)a_{11}$\n\n= $-4a_1 -3a_2 -2a_3 -a_4 -a_8 -2a_9 -3a_{10} -4a_{11}$\n\nNot obviously helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: use inequality chaining.\n\nSuppose the sequence is long enough that both $Q_1 < 0$ and $P_1 > 0$, etc.\n\nBut here's a known result:\n\n**Theorem**: If every $m$ consecutive terms have positive sum and every $n$ consecutive terms have negative sum, then the maximal possible length of the sequence is $m + n - \\gcd(m,n) - 1$\n\nBut I recall a specific case: for $m=7$, $n=11$, coprime, $\\gcd=1$, so max length $7+11-1-1=16$?\n\nWait, actually, in some references, the maximal length is $m + n - \\gcd(m,n) - 1$ when the sums are strictly opposite.\n\nBut let's try to construct.\n\nSuppose we try to make a periodic sequence.\n\nBut all terms non-zero integers.\n\nI recall that in such problems, the maximum length is $m + n - \\gcd(m,n) - 1$\n\nSince $\\gcd(7,11)=1$, then $7+11-1-1=16$\n\nSo maximum $n=16$\n\nCan we achieve 16?\n\nYes, there is a construction.\n\nBut we don't need to construct, just find maximal length.\n\nBut the problem says: \"find a sequence of maximal length\", but actually it says \"find\" such a sequence, but then the answer is likely the maximal length?\n\nWait, re-read:\n\n> Find a sequence of maximal length consisting of non-zero integers in which the sum of any seven consecutive terms starting from position $i = k$ onwards is positive and that of any eleven consecutive terms starting from position $i = k$ onwards is negative.\n\nBut then it doesn't ask for the length, but to \"find\" such a sequence.\n\nBut the final answer format is a single value in quotes.\n\nAnd earlier we were to find $k = f(0)+1 = 1$, and then use that to define where the sums start.\n\nBut $k=1$, so sums start from index 1.\n\nNow, the question is to find such a sequence of **maximal length**, but what should we output?\n\nLooking back: the problem says \"Instead of determining all functions... simply find $k = f(0)+1$\", and then \"find a sequence...\", but then the final answer is expected to be a single value.\n\nBut the way it's phrased, it might be that after finding $k$, we are to find the maximal length of such a sequence, and that is the answer.\n\nBecause otherwise, outputting a whole sequence in JSON string is messy.\n\nMoreover, the instruction says: \"provide your final answer in the exact JSON format\", with \"answer\": \"your final answer\"\n\nAnd examples are like \"42\" or \"Monday\"\n\nSo likely, the final answer is a number.\n\nGiven that, and since $k=1$ was intermediate, but now the sequence part depends on $k$, but $k=1$, and the condition is on sums starting from $i=1$, so it's the standard problem.\n\nAnd the maximal length of a sequence of non-zero integers such that every 7 consecutive terms (from start) have positive sum, and every 11 consecutive terms (from start) have negative sum.\n\nBut \"starting from $i=k$ onwards\" — since $k=1$, it means all 7-consecutive sums that start at $i\\geq1$ and fit in the sequence must be positive, similarly for 11.\n\nSo yes, all such sums in the entire sequence (that start at $i\\geq1$) must satisfy the conditions.\n\nSo we need the maximal $n$ such that:\n\n- For all $i$ with $i+6 \\leq n$, sum of $a_i$ to $a_{i+6} > 0$\n- For all $i$ with $i+10 \\leq n$, sum of $a_i$ to $a_{i+10} < 0$\n- Each $a_j \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$\n\nWhat is the maximal $n$?\n\nThis is a known type.\n\nUse the following argument:\n\nSuppose such a sequence exists of length $n$.\n\nLet $S = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$\n\nBut better: consider the sum of all 7-consecutive sums:\n\nLet $A = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-6} P_i > 0$ since each $P_i > 0$\n\nSimilarly, $B = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-10} Q_i < 0$\n\nNow, in $A$, each $a_j$ appears in as many $P_i$ as the number of $i$ such that $i \\leq j \\leq i+6$, $1 \\leq i \\leq n-6$\n\nSo $i \\geq \\max(1, j-6)$, $i \\leq \\min(n-6, j)$\n\nNumber of times $a_j$ appears: $\\min(n-6, j) - \\max(1, j-6) + 1$\n\nSimilarly for $Q_i$: each $a_j$ appears in $\\min(n-10, j) - \\max(1, j-10) + 1$ of the $Q_i$'s.\n\nBut this is messy.\n\nStandard result: the maximal length is $7 + 11 - 2 = 16$\n\nWhy minus 2? Because if $n \\geq 17$, then consider $Q_1 = a_1 + \\cdots + a_{11} < 0$\n\nBut $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_7$ are all defined if $n \\geq 13$, but for $n \\geq 17$, we have more.\n\nActually, suppose $n = 17$\n\nThen $Q_1 = a_1 + \\cdots + a_{11} < 0$\n\n$Q_2 = a_2 + \\cdots + a_{12} < 0$\n\n...\n\n$Q_7 = a_7 + \\cdots + a_{17} < 0$\n\nThere are 7 such $Q_i$'s.\n\nSimilarly, $P_1$ to $P_{11}$ are all $>0$\n\nNow consider the sum $T = Q_1 + Q_2 + \\cdots + Q_7$\n\nEach $Q_i < 0$, so $T < 0$\n\nBut compute coefficient of each $a_j$ in $T$:\n\n- $a_1$: only $Q_1$ → 1\n- $a_2$: $Q_1,Q_2$ → 2\n- ...\n- $a_7$: $Q_1$ to $Q_7$ → 7\n- $a_8$: $Q_1$ to $Q_7$? $Q_1$ goes to $a_{11}$, $Q_7$ starts at $a_7$, so $a_8$ in $Q_1$ to $Q_7$ → 7 times\n- Similarly, $a_9, a_{10}, a_{11}$: in all 7 $Q_i$'s\n- $a_{12}$: $Q_2$ to $Q_7$ → 6 times\n- $a_{13}$: $Q_3$ to $Q_7$ → 5\n- ...\n- $a_{17}$: $Q_7$ → 1\n\nSo coefficients:\n\n- $a_1$:1, $a_2$:2, ..., $a_7$:7\n- $a_8$:7, $a_9$:7, $a_{10}$:7, $a_{11}$:7\n- $a_{12}$:6, $a_{13}$:5, $a_{14}$:4, $a_{15}$:3, $a_{16}$:2, $a_{17}$:1\n\nSo $T = \\sum_{j=1}^{17} c_j a_j$ with $c_j$ as above, and $T < 0$\n\nNow consider sum of $P_i$ for $i=1$ to $11$: $U = \\sum_{i=1}^{11} P_i > 0$\n\nEach $P_i > 0$, so $U > 0$\n\nCoefficient of $a_j$ in $U$:\n\nFor $P_i$, $i=1$ to $11$, each $a_j$ appears in number of $i$ with $i \\leq j \\leq i+6$, $1 \\leq i \\leq 11$\n\nSo $i \\geq \\max(1, j-6)$, $i \\leq \\min(11, j)$\n\nSo count = $\\min(11,j) - \\max(1,j-6) + 1$\n\nCompute:\n\n- $j=1$: min=1, max=1 → 1\n- $j=2$: min=2, max=1 → 2-1+1=2\n- ...\n- $j=7$: min=7, max=1 → 7-1+1=7\n- $j=8$: min=8, max=2 → 8-2+1=7\n- $j=9$: min=9, max=3 → 9-3+1=7\n- $j=10$: min=10, max=4 → 10-4+1=7\n- $j=11$: min=11, max=5 → 11-5+1=7\n- $j=12$: min=11, max=6 → 11-6+1=6\n- $j=13$: min=11, max=7 → 11-7+1=5\n- $j=14$: min=11, max=8 → 11-8+1=4\n- $j=15$: min=11, max=9 → 11-9+1=3\n- $j=16$: min=11, max=10 → 11-10+1=2\n- $j=17$: min=11, max=11 → 11-11+1=1\n\nExactly the same coefficients as in $T$!\n\nSo $U = T$, but $U > 0$, $T < 0$, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, $n = 17$ is impossible.\n\nThus, maximum $n \\leq 16$\n\nCan we achieve $n = 16$?\n\nYes, it is possible.\n\nFor example, one can construct a sequence where the first few terms are large positive, then negative, tuned so that 7-sums are positive, 11-sums are negative.\n\nSince the impossibility proof fails for $n=16$, and it's known that the bound is tight when $m,n$ coprime, the maximum is $m+n-2 = 7+11-2=16$\n\nThus, maximal length is 16.\n\nAnd since $k=1$, the sums start at $i=1$, so the entire range is covered.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 16.\n\nBut wait — the problem says \"find a sequence\", but we are to output a single value.\n\nGiven the context, and that the first part led to $k=1$, and now the sequence length is 16, and the final answer is to be boxed, likely the intended answer is 16.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nProblem: \"find $k = f(0) + 1$\" — we did, $k=1$\n\nThen \"find a sequence of maximal length...\" — so we need to provide such a sequence? But the answer format is a single value.\n\nUnless the \"final answer\" is the length.\n\nPerhaps the problem is to realize that $k=1$, and then the maximal length is 16, and that is the answer.\n\nMaybe the answer is the length.\n\nIn many such problems, the answer is the maximal length.\n\nGiven that for $n=17$ we have contradiction, and $n=16$ is possible, the maximal length is 16.\n\nSo final answer is 16.\n\nBut let's make sure about $k$.\n\nWe found $k=1$, and the sequence starts sums from $i=1$, so yes.\n\nThus, the maximal length is 16.\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"16\"\n}",
