Alice and Bob play a game on a board consisting of one row of $k + 2021$ consecutive squares. They take turns placing tiles that cover two adjacent squares, with Alice going first. By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule. Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends; Bob's goal is to minimize it. What is the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure at the end of the game, no matter how Bob plays?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given a two-part problem. First, we must determine $ k $, which is defined as the part size in the solution with the smallest possible $ n $ to the equation system:\\n\\n- $ k_1 + k_2 + \\\\cdots + k_n = 5n - 4 $\\n- $ \\\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\\\frac{1}{k_2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{k_n} = 1 $\\n\\nwith all $ k_i $ and $ n $ positive integers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Minimize $ n $ such that there exist positive integers $ k_1, \\\\dots, k_n $ satisfying both equations.\\n\\nLet’s denote:\\n\\n- Sum: $ S = \\\\sum k_i = 5n - 4 $\\n- Reciprocal sum: $ T = \\\\sum \\\\frac{1}{k_i} = 1 $\\n\\nWe aim to find the **smallest** possible $ n $ for which such integers exist, and then take $ k $ to be one of the $ k_i $ values (but the problem says 'the part size', implying perhaps a repeated value or the minimal configuration).\\n\\nBut actually, the phrasing says: *\\\"$ k $ is the part size in the solution with the smallest possible $ n $, derived from the structural consideration of minimal number of terms...\\\"* — this suggests that in the minimal-$ n $ solution, perhaps all $ k_i $ are equal or there's a dominant part size. But more likely, since it refers to \\\"the part size\\\", it may imply that in the optimal decomposition, many terms are equal, and $ k $ is that common value.\\n\\nBut let’s first search for the minimal $ n $ such that there exist positive integers $ k_1, \\\\ldots, k_n $ with sum $ 5n - 4 $ and reciprocal sum 1.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Use inequality to bound $ n $\\n\\nWe know from the AM-HM inequality:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\sum k_i}{n} \\\\geq \\\\frac{n}{\\\\sum \\\\frac{1}{k_i}}\\n$$\\n\\nSince $ \\\\sum k_i = 5n - 4 $, $ \\\\sum \\\\frac{1}{k_i} = 1 $, so:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{5n - 4}{n} \\\\geq \\\\frac{n}{1} \\\\Rightarrow 5 - \\\\frac{4}{n} \\\\geq n\\n$$\\n\\nMultiply both sides by $ n $ (positive):\\n\\n$$\\n5n - 4 \\\\geq n^2 \\\\Rightarrow n^2 - 5n + 4 \\\\leq 0\\n$$\\n\\nSolve quadratic inequality:\\n\\nRoots of $ n^2 - 5n + 4 = 0 $ are:\\n\\n$$\\nn = \\\\frac{5 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{25 - 16}}{2} = \\\\frac{5 \\\\pm 3}{2} \\\\Rightarrow n = 1, 4\\n$$\\n\\nSo $ n^2 - 5n + 4 \\\\leq 0 $ for $ n \\\\in [1, 4] $\\n\\nThus, only possible $ n = 1, 2, 3, 4 $\\n\\nWait! This gives an upper bound: $ n \\\\leq 4 $\\n\\nBut let’s test these small values.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Try $ n = 1 $:\\n\\nSum: $ k_1 = 5(1) - 4 = 1 $\\nReciprocal: $ 1/k_1 = 1/1 = 1 $ → satisfies.\\n\\nSo $ n = 1 $, $ k_1 = 1 $ works!\\n\\nIs that valid?\\n\\n- $ k_1 = 1 $\\n- $ k_1 = 5(1) - 4 = 1 $ ✓\\n- $ 1/k_1 = 1 $ ✓\\n\\nYes! So minimal $ n = 1 $, and the only $ k_1 = 1 $. So $ k = 1 $\\n\\nBut wait — is $ k = 1 $? The problem says \\\"$ k $ is the part size in the solution with the smallest possible $ n $\\\" — yes, $ n = 1 $, $ k_1 = 1 $, so $ k = 1 $\\n\\nBut now proceed to next part: Alice and Bob play on a board of $ k + 2021 $ squares. Since $ k = 1 $, board has $ 1 + 2021 = 2022 $ squares.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Game on $ 2022 $ consecutive squares\\n\\n- Players alternate placing tiles covering **two adjacent** squares.\\n- No overlapping.\\n- Alice goes first.\\n- Goal: Maximize/minimize number of uncovered squares at end.\\n- Alice wants to **maximize** uncovered squares.\\n- Bob wants to **minimize** them.\\n- We are to find the **maximum number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure**, regardless of Bob’s play.\\n\\nThis is a classic impartial game, similar to Kayles or tiling games.\\n\\nTotal squares: $ N = 2022 $\\nEach tile covers 2 squares, so maximum number of tiles is $ \\\\lfloor N/2 \\\\rfloor = 1011 $, leaving 0 uncovered if fully tiled.\\nBut players may not cooperate.\\n\\nAlice wants to leave as many uncovered as possible; Bob wants to minimize that.\\n\\nWe are to compute the **value of the game**: the number of uncovered squares when both play optimally.\\n\\nNote: At the end, no more domino (2-square tile) can be placed. That means every remaining uncovered square is isolated — i.e., no two adjacent uncovered squares remain.\\n\\nBut actually, no: the rule is that a tile must cover two adjacent **uncovered** squares. So the game ends when there is no pair of adjacent uncovered squares.\\n\\nThus, the final position has no two adjacent uncovered squares? No — it could have many uncovered squares, but no two adjacent ones? Not necessarily — they could be adjacent, but blocked by covered tiles.\\n\\nActually: the condition is just that there is no pair of adjacent squares that are both uncovered. Because otherwise you could place a tile.\\n\\nSo the game ends when the set of uncovered squares forms an independent set — no two adjacent.\\n\\nBut more precisely: the game ends when there is no edge (adjacent pair) in the uncovered region.\\n\\nSo the final uncovered squares form a set with **no two adjacent**.\\n\\nHence, the number of uncovered squares is at most the size of the maximum independent set, but here it's determined by the game.\\n\\nBut we want the **number of uncovered squares when no more move is possible**, under optimal play where Alice tries to maximize this number, Bob to minimize it.\\n\\nThis is a known type of combinatorial game.\\n\\nLet $ f(N) $ be the number of uncovered squares at the end of the game on $ N $ cells, under optimal play, with Alice starting, Alice maximizing uncovered, Bob minimizing.\\n\\nWe want $ f(2022) $\\n\\nEach move covers 2 squares, so reduces available space.\\n\\nBut players choose where to place.\\n\\nAlice wants to fragment the board into odd-sized segments or isolate single squares.\\nBob wants to keep things even and packable.\\n\\nKnown result: In such a game, if both players play optimally, the final number of uncovered squares depends on parity and control.\\n\\nBut let's think.\\n\\nSuppose the board has $ N $ squares.\\n\\nMaximum possible uncovered squares at end: if players cooperate to leave as many as possible, they can leave up to $ N \\\\bmod 2 $ if they fill all possible, but no — they can leave many if they create isolated single squares.\\n\\nBut each tile blocks placement.\\n\\nKey idea: Every tile placed removes two squares from being covered later, but also may split the board into components.\\n\\nThis game is similar to the \\\"domino placement game\\\" with conflicting goals.\\n\\nThere is a known strategy: if the total number of squares is even, and players alternate, then the number of moves is at most $ \\\\lfloor N/2 \\\\rfloor $, but depending on play, fewer moves may occur.\\n\\nLet $ m $ be the number of tiles placed. Then uncovered squares = $ N - 2m $\\n\\nAlice wants to **minimize $ m $** (since she wants to maximize uncovered), Bob wants to **maximize $ m $**.\\n\\nSo it's a game where Alice tries to reduce the number of dominoes placed, Bob tries to increase it.\\n\\nWe want $ N - 2m $, where $ m $ is the number of dominoes placed under optimal play: Alice minimizing $ m $, Bob maximizing $ m $.\\n\\nSo define $ m^* $: the number of dominoes placed when Alice tries to minimize it and Bob to maximize it, Alice moving first.\\n\\nThen answer is $ N - 2m^* $\\n\\nNow, what is $ m^* $ for a line of $ N $ cells?\\n\\nThis is a known impartial game. There is literature on such games.\\n\\nBut let's do small cases.\\n\\nLet $ g(N) $ = minimum number of dominoes that can be forced by Alice (i.e., the min max value: Alice plays to minimize final domino count, Bob to maximize it).\\n\\nWe want $ g(N) $, then answer is $ N - 2g(N) $\\n\\nBase cases:\\n\\n- $ N = 1 $: no move possible. $ m = 0 $. So $ g(1) = 0 $\\n- $ N = 2 $: Alice places one domino. Only move. $ m = 1 $. So $ g(2) = 1 $\\n- $ N = 3 $: Squares 1-2-3\\n  Alice can place domino on 1-2: leaves square 3 → Bob cannot move. Total dominoes: 1\\n  Or Alice places on 2-3: leaves 1 → same\\n  Can Alice do better (i.e., force fewer than 1)? No, she must place one.\\n  So $ g(3) = 1 $\\n  Uncovered: 1\\n\\nBut could she avoid placing? No, she must place if possible? Wait — the rules don't say players must move if possible, but in combinatorial games, usually players move if possible. The problem says: \\\"They take turns placing tiles... The game ends when no tile can be placed...\\\"\\n\\nSo if a player can move, they must? Not necessarily — but in standard interpretation, players move as long as possible. But here, since Alice wants to maximize uncovered, she might prefer not to move — but the rules say they take turns, so probably they **must** move if possible.\\n\\nYes — because the game ends only when no move is possible. So as long as a move exists, the current player must make one.\\n\\nSo players are forced to move if possible.\\n\\nTherefore, the number of moves is determined solely by the structure — but players choose where to move, affecting future options.\\n\\nSo back to $ N=3 $: only possible moves are on 1-2 or 2-3. Either way, after one domino, one square left, isolated. Game over. So exactly one move. $ m = 1 $, uncovered = 1.\\n\\n$ N = 4 $: squares 1-2-3-4\\n\\nAlice moves first.\\n\\nOptions:\\n- Play in middle: say 2-3. Then leaves [1] and [4], both isolated. No more moves. Total moves: 1. Uncovered: 2\\n- Play on end: 1-2. Leaves 3-4. Bob plays 3-4. Total moves: 2. Uncovered: 0\\n\\nAlice wants to **maximize** uncovered, so she prefers the first outcome (2 uncovered). So she will play in the center: 2-3.\\n\\nCan she do that? Yes.\\n\\nSo Alice chooses to play 2-3, blocking the rest. Then game ends. Only one domino placed.\\n\\nSo $ m = 1 $, uncovered = 2\\n\\nThus, Alice can ensure 2 uncovered squares.\\n\\nBob cannot prevent this — Alice chooses the move.\\n\\nSo $ g(4) = 1 $, uncovered = 4 - 2×1 = 2\\n\\n$ N = 5 $:\\n\\nAlice moves.\\n\\nOptions:\\n- Play at end: 1-2 → leaves 3-4-5 (a segment of 3)\\n  Bob plays on 3-4 or 4-5, say 3-4 → leaves 5 → no more moves. Total moves: 2. Uncovered: 1\\n- Play 2-3 → leaves [1] and [4-5]\\n  Bob plays 4-5. Total moves: 2. Uncovered: 1\\n- Play 3-4 → symmetric to above\\n- Play in center: 3-4? Same.\\n- Can she play to leave no further moves?\\n  If she plays 2-3: leaves 1 and 4-5 → Bob plays 4-5\\n  Similarly, if she plays 1-2: Bob plays 3-4 or 4-5? On 3-4-5, Bob can play 3-4 or 4-5, leaving one square.\\n  So always two moves.\\n\\nIs there a move that allows only one total?\\n\\nSuppose Alice plays 1-2: leaves 3-4-5. Bob can and will play, say, 3-4, leaving 5. Done. Two moves.\\n\\nIf Alice plays 2-3: leaves 1 and 4-5. Bob plays 4-5. Two moves.\\n\\nSame for others.\\n\\nNo way to block both sides completely. Any domino leaves at least one segment of length ≥2? Let's see:\\n\\n- Move on 1-2: leaves 3-4-5 (length 3) → playable\\n- Move on 2-3: leaves 1 (size 1) and 4-5 (size 2) → Bob plays 4-5\\n- Move on 3-4: similar\\n- Move on 4-5: similar to 1-2\\n\\nAll lead to Bob making one more move.\\n\\nSo total 2 moves. Uncovered: 5 - 4 = 1\\n\\nSo $ g(5) = 2 $, uncovered = 1\\n\\n$ N = 6 $:\\n\\nAlice moves.\\n\\nShe wants to minimize total dominoes placed.\\n\\nOptions:\\n- Play in center: say 3-4. Then splits into [1-2] and [5-6]. Bob can play on one, say 1-2. Then Alice can play on 5-6. So all three dominoes placed. Uncovered: 0. Bad for Alice.\\n- Play on 2-3: leaves [1] and [4-5-6]\\n  Bob plays on 4-5-6: he can play 4-5 → leaves 6; or 5-6 → leaves 4. Either way, one move. Total moves: 2. Uncovered: 2\\n  After Bob moves, no more moves. So only two dominoes.\\n  So uncovered = 6 - 4 = 2\\n- Similarly, if Alice plays 1-2: leaves 3-4-5-6 (length 4)\\n  Bob can play in the center: 4-5 → leaves 3 and 6 → no more moves. So only two dominoes. Uncovered: 2\\n  Or Bob plays 3-4 → leaves 5-6 → Alice plays 5-6 → three dominoes. But Bob wants to **maximize** number of dominoes (to minimize uncovered), so Bob will choose to play to allow continuation.\\n\\nAh! Important: Bob wants to **minimize uncovered squares**, so he wants to **maximize** the number of dominoes placed.\\n\\nSo in subgames, Bob will play to allow as many future moves as possible.\\n\\nBack to $ N=6 $, Alice plays 1-2 → leaves 3-4-5-6\\n\\nBob now wants to maximize total dominoes. He can:\\n- Play 3-4 → leaves 5-6 → Alice is forced to play 5-6 (if she can) → three dominoes total\\n- Or play 4-5 → leaves 3 and 6 → no more moves → only two dominoes\\n\\nSo Bob will choose 3-4 (or 5-6) to allow Alice to continue.\\n\\nAfter Bob plays 3-4, Alice can play 5-6. So three dominoes.\\n\\nSimilarly if Bob plays 5-6, Alice plays 3-4.\\n\\nSo if Alice starts with 1-2, Bob can force a full tiling: 3 dominoes, uncovered 0.\\n\\nBut Alice wants to avoid that.\\n\\nWhat if Alice plays 2-3? Leaves [1] and [4-5-6]\\n\\nBob now plays on 4-5-6. To maximize dominoes, he should play 4-5 → leaves 6; or 5-6 → leaves 4. Either way, only one move possible in that segment. So Bob makes one move, total dominoes: 2 (Alice + Bob). Then game over. Uncovered: 6 - 4 = 2\\n\\nSimilarly, if Alice plays 3-4 (center), splits into [1-2] and [5-6]. Bob plays, say, 1-2. Then Alice can play 5-6. So again three dominoes.\\n\\nSo if Alice plays in center or on end, Bob can force three dominoes.\\n\\nBut if Alice plays near end, like 2-3 or 4-5, she can limit.\\n\\nTry Alice plays 2-3: leaves 1 (isolated), and 4-5-6\\n\\nBob plays in 4-5-6: best he can do is one more domino (say 4-5 or 5-6), leaving one square.\\n\\nSo total two dominoes. Uncovered: 2\\n\\nSimilarly if Alice plays 4-5: symmetric.\\n\\nCan Alice do better than 2 uncovered?\\n\\nOnly if she can force only one domino.\\n\\nSuppose she plays 3-4: splits into 1-2 and 5-6. Bob plays one, say 1-2, then Alice plays 5-6 → three dominoes.\\n\\nWorse.\\n\\nPlay 1-2: Bob can force two more? As above, Bob plays 3-4, Alice plays 5-6 → three.\\n\\nSo only when Alice plays at position 2-3 or 4-5 (i.e., offset from end), she can cap at two dominoes.\\n\\nSo best Alice can do is force only two dominoes to be placed, by playing 2-3 or 4-5.\\n\\nThen uncovered = 6 - 4 = 2\\n\\nSo $ f(6) = 2 $\\n\\nSummary:\\n\\n| N | uncovered (Alice max, Bob min) |\\n|---|---|\\n| 1 | 1 |\\n| 2 | 0 |\\n| 3 | 1 |\\n| 4 | 2 |\\n| 5 | 1 |\\n| 6 | 2 |\\n\\nWait:\\n- N=1: 1 uncovered\\n- N=2: 1 domino → 0\\n- N=3: 1 domino → 1\\n- N=4: Alice plays center → 1 domino → 2 uncovered\\n- N=5: 2 dominoes → 1 uncovered\\n- N=6: Alice can force only 2 dominoes? But earlier analysis: if she plays badly, 3 dominoes; but she can choose to play 2-3, leading to only one more move by Bob → total 2 dominoes → 2 uncovered\\n\\nBut Bob, when faced with a segment of 3, will play and cover 2, leaving 1.\\n\\nSo yes, only two dominoes.\\n\\nSo f(6)=2\\n\\nNow N=7:\\n\\nAlice moves.\\n\\nShe wants to minimize domino count.\\n\\nSuppose she plays in center: 4-5? Then splits into [1-2-3] and [6-7]\\n\\nBob can play on [6-7] → covers it. Then [1-2-3] remains. Next player (Alice) must play on it: say 1-2 or 2-3, leaving one. So one more domino.\\n\\nTotal dominoes: Alice (1) + Bob (1) + Alice (1) = 3\\nUncovered: 7 - 6 = 1\\n\\nCan Alice do better?\\n\\nSuppose she plays 3-4: leaves [1-2] and [5-6-7]\\n\\nBob can play on [1-2] → then [5-6-7] remains. Alice plays on it, covers two, leaves one. So again three dominoes.\\n\\nOr Bob plays on [5-6-7]: say 5-6 → leaves 7; then Alice plays 1-2. Still three dominoes.\\n\\nSuppose Alice plays 2-3: leaves [1] and [4-5-6-7] (length 4)\\n\\nBob now plays on the length-4 segment. From N=4, if a player moves on a length-4, they can choose to play in center (2-3 of that segment, i.e., 5-6) → splits into [4] and [7], so no more moves. Then only one domino in that segment.\\n\\nBut Bob wants to **maximize** dominoes, so he would prefer to allow more.\\n\\nOn a segment of 4, if Bob plays end, say 4-5, then leaves 6-7 → Alice can play 6-7 → two dominoes in the segment.\\n\\nSo Bob, wanting to maximize total dominoes, will play 4-5 or 6-7 to allow continuation.\\n\\nSay Bob plays 4-5 → leaves 6-7 → Alice plays 6-7 → two dominoes in the segment.\\n\\nPlus Alice's initial 2-3, total three dominoes.\\n\\nUncovered: 1\\n\\nSame as before.\\n\\nCan Alice play to leave two isolated singles?\\n\\nSuppose she plays 1-2: leaves 3-4-5-6-7 (length 5)\\n\\nFrom earlier, N=5 leads to 2 dominoes (uncovered 1)\\n\\nSo Bob plays first on length-5: he can force 2 dominoes to be placed there.\\n\\nSo total dominoes: Alice (1) + 2 in the rest = 3\\n\\nAgain 3 dominoes.\\n\\nSeems unavoidable.\\n\\nSo f(7) = 1\\n\\nPattern emerging:\\n\\nN | uncovered\\n1 | 1\\n2 | 0\\n3 | 1\\n4 | 2\\n5 | 1\\n6 | 2\\n7 | 1\\n8 | ?\\n\\nTry N=8\\n\\nAlice wants to maximize uncovered.\\n\\nSuppose she plays 4-5 (center). Splits into [1-2-3] and [6-7-8], each length 3.\\n\\nBob plays on one, say 1-2 in first → leaves 3\\nThen Alice plays on second, say 6-7 → leaves 8\\nTotal dominoes: 3 (Alice made two, Bob one?) Wait:\\n- Alice: 4-5\\n- Bob: say 1-2\\n- Alice: 6-7\\nTotal: 3 dominoes\\nUncovered: 8 - 6 = 2\\n\\nCould Bob do better? After Alice plays 4-5, Bob plays in one segment, but cannot do more. Each segment of 3 allows one domino.\\n\\nSo total three dominoes, uncovered 2.\\n\\nBut can Alice get more?\\n\\nSuppose she plays 3-4. Leaves [1-2] and [5-6-7-8]\\n\\n[1-2] can take one domino, [5-6-7-8] is length 4.\\n\\nBob moves. He can:\\n- Play on [1-2] → then [5-6-7-8] remains. Alice moves on it. She can play 6-7 (center), preventing further moves → so only one domino in that segment. Total dominoes: Alice(1) + Bob(1) + Alice(1) = 3 → uncovered 2\\n- Or Bob plays on [5-6-7-8]: to maximize, he might play 5-6 → leaves 7-8 → Alice plays 7-8 → two dominoes there. Plus [1-2] still playable? But after Bob plays 5-6, and Alice plays 7-8, then [1-2] is still free. Next player is Bob? Sequence:\\n  - Alice: 3-4\\n  - Bob: 5-6\\n  - Alice: 7-8\\n  - Now [1-2] is still uncovered and adjacent → Bob plays 1-2\\n  Total: 4 dominoes! Uncovered 0\\n\\nOh! So if Alice plays 3-4, and Bob plays properly, he can force four dominoes.\\n\\nBut Alice doesn't want that.\\n\\nSo she must avoid such moves.\\n\\nBack to playing 4-5 (center): leads to at most 3 dominoes, uncovered 2\\n\\nCan she get 4 uncovered?\\n\\nOnly if only 2 dominoes are placed.\\n\\nSuppose she plays 2-3: leaves [1] and [4-5-6-7-8] (length 5)\\n\\nLength 5: from earlier, leads to 2 dominoes (uncovered 1)\\n\\nBob moves on length 5: he can force 2 dominoes to be placed there.\\n\\nSo total dominoes: Alice (1) + 2 in large segment = 3\\nUncovered: 2\\n\\nSame.\\n\\nPlay 1-2: leaves length 6.\\n\\nN=6: earlier, if played optimally, how many dominoes?\\n\\nBut now Bob is first player on length 6, and he wants to **maximize** dominoes (since he wants to minimize uncovered).\\n\\nOn N=6, if Bob moves first and wants to maximize dominoes, can he force 3?\\n\\nYes: if the segment is 1-2-3-4-5-6, Bob plays 1-2 → then Alice faces 3-4-5-6\\n\\nAlice, wanting to minimize dominoes, might play 4-5 → leaves 3 and 6 → no more moves. So only two dominoes total on segment.\\n\\nBut Bob wants more.\\n\\nBob plays 3-4 (center) → splits into [1-2] and [5-6]\\n\\nThen Alice must play on one, say 1-2, then Bob plays 5-6 → three dominoes.\\n\\nSo Bob, by playing center, can force three dominoes on N=6.\\n\\nSo if Alice starts N=8 by playing 1-2, leaving N=6, then Bob can force three dominoes on the rest, plus Alice's one, total four dominoes → uncovered 0\\n\\nWorse.\\n\\nSo best for Alice is to play center (4-5), leading to two segments of 3, each allowing one domino, total three dominoes, uncovered 2.\\n\\nSo f(8) = 2\\n\\nUpdate table:\\n\\nN | uncovered\\n1 | 1\\n2 | 0\\n3 | 1\\n4 | 2\\n5 | 1\\n6 | 2\\n7 | 1\\n8 | 2\\n\\nPattern: for $ N \\\\geq 1 $, \\n- If $ N $ odd: uncovered = 1\\n- If $ N $ even: uncovered = 2\\n\\nBut N=2: even, uncovered=0 — exception\\nN=4: 2, N=6:2, N=8:2\\nN=2 is special.\\n\\nSo for $ N \\\\geq 4 $, even: uncovered = 2?\\nBut N=2: 0\\n\\nCheck N=9:\\n\\nIf pattern holds, odd >1, should be 1.\\n\\nAlice moves on N=9.\\n\\nShe can try to split into symmetric parts.\\n\\nPlay 5-6 (center-ish). Leaves [1-2-3-4] and [7-8-9]\\n\\n[1-2-3-4] is length 4, [7-8-9] length 3.\\n\\nBob moves. He will play on one segment to maximize total dominoes.\\n\\nSuppose he plays on length 4: if he plays end, say 1-2, then Alice can play 3-4? But then two dominoes in that segment.\\nBut Alice might not want that.\\n\\nActually, Bob wants to maximize, so he might play center on length 4: 2-3 → leaves 1 and 4 → no more moves. Only one domino.\\nBut if he plays 1-2, then Alice could play 3-4 → two dominoes.\\n\\nBut Alice is opponent: she wants to minimize dominoes, so in the length-4 segment, if Bob plays 1-2, then Alice will **not** play 3-4; instead, she might be forced? No, if 3-4 are both uncovered and adjacent, she could play, but she wants to minimize total dominoes, so she would prefer not to — but she must move if possible.\\n\\nYes — if a move is available, she must make a move.\\n\\nSo if Bob plays 1-2 on length-4, then 3-4 are still adjacent and uncovered, so Alice must play 3-4 (only choice). So two dominoes in that segment.\\n\\nSimilarly, if Bob plays 2-3, then 1 and 4 are isolated, no move, so only one domino.\\n\\nSo Bob, wanting to maximize, will play 1-2 (or 3-4) to allow a second move.\\n\\nSo he can force two dominoes in length-4.\\n\\nIn length-3, only one domino possible.\\n\\nSo depending on where Bob plays:\\n- If he plays on length-4: he can force two dominoes there (by playing end)\\n- Then the length-3 remains: next player (Alice) must play there? After Bob plays first move in length-4, Alice is to move: she must play the second domino in length-4 (3-4). Then Bob plays on length-3: say 7-8, leaving 9. So one domino there.\\nTotal dominoes: Alice(1) [initial] + Bob(1) + Alice(1) + Bob(1) = 4? Wait no:\\n- Alice: 5-6\\n- Bob: 1-2 (on left)\\n- Alice: forced to play 3-4\\n- Bob: plays 7-8 (on right)\\n- Alice: no move? 9 is alone. Done.\\nTotal dominoes: 4\\nUncovered: 9 - 8 = 1\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nIf Bob had played on the length-3 first: say 7-8, then Alice is to move on length-4. She will play to minimize: she might play 2-3 → prevents 1-2 and 3-4? Playing 2-3 covers 2-3, leaves 1 and 4. So only one domino in length-4. Total: Alice(1) + Bob(1) + Alice(1) = 3 dominoes, uncovered 3 — better for Alice.\\n\\nBut Bob, wanting to minimize uncovered (maximize dominoes), will not choose this path. He will play on the length-4 first to force two dominoes there.\\n\\nSo he does that.\\n\\nThus, 4 dominoes, uncovered 1.\\n\\nCan Alice do better?\\n\\nSuppose she plays differently.\\n\\nBut likely, 1 is the best she can expect for odd N>1.\\n\\nNow back to pattern:\\n- N=1: 1\\n- N=2: 0\\n- N=3: 1\\n- N=4: 2\\n- N=5: 1\\n- N=6: 2\\n- N=7: 1\\n- N=8: 2\\n- N=9: 1\\n\\nSo for $ N \\\\geq 3 $, if N odd, uncovered = 1; if N even, uncovered = 2; except N=2 gives 0.\\n\\nBut N=2022 is even, greater than 2, so uncovered = 2?\\n\\nBut wait — is this sustainable?\\n\\nActually, there is a known result: in such a game, the first player can always ensure at least $ N \\\\bmod 2 $ uncovered, but here it's different.\\n\\nAnother thought: the maximum number of uncovered squares is equal to the number of 'gaps' created.\\n\\nBut from pattern, for even $ N \\\\geq 4 $, Alice can ensure 2 uncovered squares.\\n\\nHow? By splitting the board into two odd parts, or playing in a way that creates isolated regions.\\n\\nBut in N=4, she gets 2.\\nIn N=6, she gets 2.\\nIn N=8, 2.\\n\\nCan she get more than 2 for larger N?\\n\\nSuppose N=10.\\n\\nAlice plays 5-6 (center). Splits into two segments of 4.\\n\\nEach segment of 4: if a player moves on it, they can be forced to allow two dominoes? No.\\n\\nOn a segment of 4, the first player can choose to play center (2-3) to block, resulting in only one domino.\\n\\nBut Bob wants to maximize, so if Bob is first on a segment of 4, he will play end to allow two dominoes.\\n\\nBut in this case, after Alice plays 5-6, Bob moves.\\n\\nBob can go to one segment of 4, play 1-2 (say), then Alice is forced to play 3-4 in that segment.\\nThen Bob goes to the other segment of 4, plays 7-8, Alice forced to play 9-10.\\nTotal dominoes: 5\\nUncovered: 0\\n\\nOh! So if Alice plays center, Bob can force full tiling.\\n\\nBut Alice doesn't want that.\\n\\nCan she play differently?\\n\\nSuppose Alice plays 4-5. Leaves [1-2-3] and [6-7-8-9-10] (length 3 and 5)\\n\\nBob will likely play on the larger segment.\\n\\nHe plays on length 5: to maximize, he can force 2 dominoes there.\\n\\nFor example, play 6-7 → leaves 8-9-10. Alice must play, say 8-9 or 9-10, leaving one. So only one more domino? Total two in length 5.\\n\\nThen the length 3: after that, someone plays on it.\\n\\nSequence:\\n- Alice: 4-5\\n- Bob: 6-7\\n- Alice: say 8-9 → leaves 10\\n- Bob: plays 1-2 or 2-3 in length 3 → say 1-2, leaves 3\\n- Alice: no move? Done.\\nTotal dominoes: 4\\nUncovered: 10 - 8 = 2\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nIf after Alice plays 4-5, Bob plays on length 3 first: 1-2, then Alice can play on length 5: she will play to minimize, e.g., play 7-8 → leaves 6,9,10? 6 is isolated, 9-10 together. Then Bob can play 9-10. So two dominoes in length 5.\\nTotal: Alice(1) + Bob(1) + Alice(1) + Bob(1) = 4, uncovered 2.\\n\\nSame.\\n\\nCan Alice get 4 uncovered?\\n\\nSuppose she wants only 3 dominoes.\\n\\nHard.\\n\\nAnother idea: Alice plays 2-3. Leaves [1] and [4-5-6-7-8-9-10] (length 7)\\n\\nLength 7: from earlier, leads to 3 dominoes (uncovered 1)\\n\\nBob moves first on it. He can force 3 dominoes.\\n\\nTotal: Alice(1) + 3 = 4, uncovered 2.\\n\\nSame.\\n\\nSo seems 2 is achievable, 0 or 2, but Alice can ensure 2.\\n\\nSimilarly for any even N >=4, Alice can ensure 2 uncovered squares.\\n\\nFor N=2, she cannot — must place one domino, uncovered 0.\\n\\nBut N=2022 is even and greater than 2, so answer should be 2.\\n\\nBut recall: we have $ k = 1 $, so board size = $ k + 2021 = 1 + 2021 = 2022 $\\n\\nAnd for $ N = 2022 $, Alice can ensure 2 uncovered squares.\\n\\nBut is there a way to get more?\\n\\nSuppose N is even, N>=4.\\n\\nAlice can play at position 2-3 (covering squares 2 and 3).\\nThis leaves square 1 isolated, and the rest from 4 to N, which is length N-3.\\n\\nN=2022, so N-3=2019, which is odd.\\n\\nAn odd-length segment can have at most $ \\\\floor{(N-3)/2} = 1009 $ dominoes, leaving 1 uncovered.\\n\\nBut the number of dominoes placed in that segment depends on play.\\n\\nBob moves first on the large segment.\\n\\nThe maximum number of dominoes that can be placed in a segment of length L is floor(L/2).\\n\\nBut due to blocking, it might be less.\\n\\nHowever, Bob wants to maximize the number, so he will try to pack as much as possible.\\n\\nBut Alice, when she plays in the large segment, will try to minimize.\\n\\nThe minimal number of uncovered squares in a segment of length L under such play is at least 1 if L is odd, 0 or 2 if even.\\n\\nBut from our earlier pattern, it seems that the first player can always ensure that at least 2 squares are uncovered for even N>=4.\\n\\nIn fact, a known result in such games is that the first player can always achieve at least 2 uncovered squares for N even, N>=4, by appropriate play.\\n\\nMoreover, the second player cannot force a full tiling if the first player prevents it.\\n\\nBut in our calculations, for N=4,6,8,10, Alice can ensure 2 uncovered.\\n\\nAnd she cannot ensure more than 2, because Bob can always ensure that at most 2 are uncovered? No, Bob wants to minimize uncovered, so he wants 0.\\n\\nBut Alice can prevent 0.\\n\\nIn N=4, she prevents 0 by playing center.\\n\\nSimilarly in larger N.\\n\\nSo the value of the game is 2 for even N >=4.\\n\\nThus for N=2022, answer is 2.\\n\\nBut wait — in the beginning, we found $ k = 1 $ from the first part.\\n\\nBut let's double-check that.\\n\\nFirst part: find minimal n such that there exist positive integers k1,...,kn with sum 5n-4 and sum of reciprocals 1.\\n\\nWe found n=1: k1=1, sum=1=5*1-4=1, and 1/1=1. Valid.\\n\\nIs there a smaller n? n=1 is minimal possible.\\n\\nSo k=1.\\n\\nBoard size: 1 + 2021 = 2022.\\n\\nGame on 2022 squares.\\n\\nAnswer: 2.\\n\\nBut the problem says: \\\"find k, where k is the part size...\\\" and then use k in the game.\\n\\nWe did.\\n\\nFinal answer: 2\",\n    \"answer\": \"2\"\n}",
