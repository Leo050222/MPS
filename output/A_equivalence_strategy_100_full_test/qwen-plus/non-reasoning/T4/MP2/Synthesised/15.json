  "math_problem": "A sequence of functions $\\\\{ f_n(x) \\\\} $ is defined recursively as follows: \\begin{align*} f_1(x) &= \\sqrt {x^2 + 48}, \\quad \\text{and} \\\\ f_{n + 1}(x) &= \\sqrt {x^2 + 6f_n(x)} \\quad \\text{for } n \\geq 1. \\end{align*} (Recall that $\\sqrt {\\makebox[5mm]{}}$ is understood to represent the positive square root .) For each positive integer $n$ , find all real solutions of the equation $ f_n(x) = 2x $ . Instead of finding all real solutions of the equation $f_n(x) = 2x$ for each positive integer $n$, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the constant satisfying $f_1(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 6k}$ derived from the given definition. One day, there is a Street Art Show at somewhere, and there are some spectators around. We consider this place as an Euclidean plane. Let $K$ be the center of the show. And name the spectators by $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}, \\ldots$ They pick their positions $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}, \\ldots$ one by one. The positions need to satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously. (i) The distance between $K$ and $A_{n}$ is no less than 10 meters, that is, $K P_{n} \\geq 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any positive integer $n$. (ii) The distance between $A_{n}$ and any previous spectator is no less than $k$ meters, that is, $P_{m} P_{n} \\geq k \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any $n \\geq 2$ and any $1 \\leq m \\leq n-1$. (iii) $A_{n}$ always choose the position closest to $K$ that satisfies (i) and (ii), that is, $K P_{n}$ reaches its minimum possible value. If there are more than one point that satisfy (i) and (ii) and have the minimum distance to $K, A_{n}$ may choose any one of them. For example, $A_{1}$ is not restricted by (ii), so he may choose any point on the circle $C$ which is centered at $K$ with radius 10 meters. For $A_{2}$, since there are lots of points on $C$ which are at least $k$ meters apart from $P_{1}$, he may choose anyone of them. (1) Which of the following statement is true? (A) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2}$ always hold (unit: meter); (B) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\sqrt{n} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} \\sqrt{n}$ always hold (unit: meter); (C) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n$ always hold (unit: meter); (D) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n^{2} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n^{2}$ always hold (unit: meter).",

The key is that each spectator chooses a position satisfying:\\n\\n(i) Distance from $ K $ is at least 10 m: $ KP_n \\\\geq 10 $\\n\\n(ii) Distance from any previous spectator $ A_m $ ($ m < n $) is at least $ k = 8 $ meters: $ P_mP_n \\\\geq 8 $\\n\\n(iii) Among all such points, choose one closest to $ K $ — i.e., minimize $ KP_n $\\n\\nThis models a greedy packing of points in the plane, each at least 8 meters apart, and each placed as close to the center as possible.\\n\\nThis is analogous to circle packing in the plane with minimum separation. The number of points that can be packed within radius $ R $ with mutual distance at least $ d $ grows like the area: roughly $ \\\\pi R^2 / (\\\\text{area per point}) $. For hexagonal packing, each point occupies area $ \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} d^2 $, so number of points $ n \\\\sim c R^2 $, hence $ R \\\\sim \\\\sqrt{n} $.\\n\\nSince the points are added greedily minimizing distance to center, the configuration will resemble a growing disk of points with density bounded by the packing constraint.\\n\\nTherefore, the distance $ KP_n $ should grow like $ \\\\sqrt{n} $, meaning there exist constants $ c_1, c_2 > 0 $ such that:\\n$$\\nc_1 \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\leq KP_n \\\\leq c_2 \\\\sqrt{n}\\n$$\\nfor all $ n $, regardless of choices made (since the minimal possible distance is enforced).\\n\\nThus, option (B) is correct.\\n\\nOptions:\\n(A) says bounded — false, since more people force some to go farther out.\\n(C) linear growth — too fast; packing is area-based, so $ \\\\sqrt{n} $ is natural.\\n(D) quadratic — way too fast.\\n\\nHence, the correct answer is (B).\",\n    \"answer\": \"B\"\n}",
