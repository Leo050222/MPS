  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\n\\nWe are given a 2×3 grid of sushi pieces. Let's label the pieces as follows:\\n\\nTop row: A B C\\nBottom row: D E F\\n\\nSo the grid looks like:\\n\\nA B C\\nD E F\\n\\nEach piece is adjacent (orthogonally) to its neighbors. The adjacency graph is:\\n\\n- A: adjacent to B, D\\n- B: adjacent to A, C, E\\n- C: adjacent to B, F\\n- D: adjacent to A, E\\n- E: adjacent to B, D, F\\n- F: adjacent to C, E\\n\\nWendy eats pieces one by one, and can only eat a piece if it is adjacent to at most two other uneaten pieces (i.e., in the remaining subgraph, the degree of the piece must be ≤2).\\n\\nBut the problem does NOT ask for the total number of valid eating orders.\\n\\nInstead, it says:\\n> find k = deg(F) + 0, where deg(F) is the degree of the bottom-right piece F in the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row.\\n\\nThe two endpoint pieces of the top row are A and C.\\n\\nSo Wendy first eats A and C.\\n\\nAfter removing A and C, which pieces remain?\\nRemaining: B, D, E, F\\n\\nNow consider the induced subgraph on {B, D, E, F}.\\n\\nLet’s determine the adjacencies among these four:\\n\\n- B: was adjacent to A, C, E → A and C are gone, so only E remains → B–E\\n- D: was adjacent to A, E → A is gone, so only E → D–E\\n- E: connected to B, D, F → all still present? F is present → E–B, E–D, E–F\\n- F: was adjacent to C, E → C is gone, so only E → F–E\\n\\nSo edges in induced subgraph:\\n- B–E\\n- D–E\\n- E–F\\n\\nSo the graph is:\\n\\nB — E — F\\n    |\\n    D\\n\\nNow, what is the degree of F?\\nF is only connected to E → degree 1.\\n\\nSo deg(F) = 1\\nThen k = deg(F) + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 1: 1\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe are to find the probability that a, b, and 1 form the side lengths of an obtuse triangle, where a and b are chosen independently and uniformly from [0,1].\\n\\nFirst, recall the conditions for three lengths to form a triangle:\\nTriangle inequality:\\n- a + b > 1  (since 1 is the largest possible side, and a,b ≤1)\\n- a + 1 > b → always true since a ≥0, 1 > b may fail but a+1 ≥1 ≥ b? Wait: b ≤1, so a+1 ≥1 ≥ b? Not necessarily strict.\\nActually: a + 1 > b: since a ≥0, a+1 ≥1, and b ≤1, so a+1 ≥1 ≥ b. But equality when a=0, b=1 → a+1 = b → not strict. So we need strict inequality.\\nSimilarly, b + 1 > a → same thing.\\n\\nBut since a and b are in [0,1], we have:\\n- a + 1 > b: since a + 1 ≥ 1 and b ≤ 1, this fails only if a + 1 ≤ b → but a ≥0, so a+1 ≥1, and b ≤1 → a+1 ≥1 ≥ b → a+1 ≥ b always, and equality when a=0, b=1.\\nSo a+1 > b unless a=0 and b=1. Similarly for b+1 > a.\\n\\nBut since it's a continuous distribution, the probability that a=0 or b=1 exactly is zero. So almost surely, a+1 > b and b+1 > a.\\n\\nThe only nontrivial triangle inequality is a + b > 1.\\n\\nSo for a triangle to exist, we need a + b > 1.\\n\\nNow, among such triangles, we want it to be obtuse.\\n\\nAn obtuse triangle has one angle >90°. By the law of cosines, this happens when the square of one side is greater than the sum of squares of the other two.\\n\\nSince 1 is the largest side (a ≤1, b≤1), the obtuse angle, if any, must be opposite the side of length 1.\\n\\nSo the triangle is obtuse if and only if:\\n1² > a² + b²\\ni.e., a² + b² < 1\\n\\nBut this is only meaningful when a triangle exists, i.e., a + b > 1.\\n\\nCould the obtuse angle be opposite a or b?\\nSuppose a is the longest side. But a ≤1, and the side of length 1 is fixed. So unless a=1, 1 is longer. Even if a=1, then sides are 1, b, 1 → isosceles. Then angle opposite a=1 would require 1² > 1² + b² → 1 > 1 + b² → impossible. Similarly for b.\\n\\nSo the only possibility for an obtuse triangle is when the angle opposite the side of length 1 is obtuse, i.e., 1² > a² + b².\\n\\nThus, the conditions are:\\n- a + b > 1  (triangle inequality)\\n- a² + b² < 1  (obtuse condition)\\n\\nAnd a, b ∈ [0,1]\\n\\nWe need the probability that both hold, with a,b ~ Uniform[0,1] independent.\\n\\nSo compute:\\nP(a + b > 1 and a² + b² < 1)\\n\\nThis is the area in the unit square [0,1]×[0,1] above the line a+b=1 and inside the circle a² + b² = 1.\\n\\nThe unit circle a² + b² = 1 passes through (1,0) and (0,1). The line a+b=1 also passes through (1,0) and (0,1).\\n\\nIn the first quadrant, the circle is above the line a+b=1 for a,b ∈ [0,1]. For example, at a=b=0.5, a+b=1, a²+b²=0.25+0.25=0.5<1, so (0.5,0.5) is below the circle. The region a²+b²<1 is inside the circle.\\n\\nThe line a+b=1 goes from (1,0) to (0,1). The circle a²+b²=1 also goes through those points, but curves inward.\\n\\nFor a,b ≥0, the circle lies above the line segment between (1,0) and (0,1). That is, the chord is below the arc.\\n\\nTherefore, the region where a+b>1 and a²+b²<1 is the segment of the disk in the first quadrant above the line a+b=1.\\n\\nWe can compute this area by integrating.\\n\\nSet up the integral.\\n\\nWe integrate over a from 0 to 1.\\n\\nFor a given a, b must satisfy:\\n- b > 1 - a\\n- b < sqrt(1 - a²)\\n- and b ≤1, but sqrt(1-a²) ≤1 for a∈[0,1], so upper bound is min(1, sqrt(1-a²)) = sqrt(1-a²)\\n\\nAlso, b ≥0.\\n\\nNow, 1 - a could be negative, but when a >1, but a≤1. When a <1, 1-a >0.\\n\\nb > max(0, 1-a), but since we are in a+b>1, and a≤1, 1-a ≥0, so b > 1-a\\n\\nBut we also need b < sqrt(1-a²)\\n\\nAnd we need 1-a < sqrt(1-a²) for there to be such b.\\n\\nFind where 1-a < sqrt(1-a²)\\n\\nSet x = a\\nSolve 1-x < sqrt(1-x²)\\n\\nSquare both sides (but only when 1-x ≥0, i.e., x≤1, which is true)\\n(1-x)^2 < 1 - x²\\n1 - 2x + x² < 1 - x²\\n1 - 2x + x² -1 + x² < 0\\n2x² - 2x < 0\\n2x(x - 1) < 0\\nSo x(x-1) < 0 → 0 < x < 1\\n\\nAt x=0: 1-0=1, sqrt(1-0)=1, so 1 < 1 false\\nAt x=1: 0 < 0 false\\nFor x∈(0,1), strict inequality? At x=0.5: 1-0.5=0.5, sqrt(1-0.25)=sqrt(0.75)≈0.866>0.5, yes.\\nBut at endpoints equality.\\n\\nSo for a ∈ (0,1), 1-a < sqrt(1-a²), so the interval for b is non-empty when 1-a < sqrt(1-a²), which is true for a ∈ (0,1), but we need the lower bound less than upper bound.\\n\\nBut also, b must be ≤1, but as said, sqrt(1-a²) ≤1.\\n\\nMoreover, b > 1-a and b < sqrt(1-a²), and we need 1-a < sqrt(1-a²), which holds for a ∈ (0,1), but at a=0: b>1, b<1 → no solution\\nAt a=1: b>0, b<0 → no solution\\n\\nSo only for a where 1-a < sqrt(1-a²), and also 1-a <1, etc.\\n\\nBut more importantly, we need 1-a < sqrt(1-a²), which as we saw holds strictly for a ∈ (0,1), but we also need that the lower bound is less than upper bound, and b in [0,1].\\n\\nAdditionally, we need that 1-a < sqrt(1-a²), which we have, but also that 1-a <1, which is true.\\n\\nBut b must be at least 1-a and less than sqrt(1-a²), and since 1-a could be negative? No, a≤1, so 1-a≥0.\\n\\nWhen a>1, but a≤1. When a<1, 1-a>0. Only when a=1, 1-a=0.\\n\\nBut at a=1, b>0 and b<0 → impossible.\\n\\nNow, the critical point is that for small a, 1-a is close to 1, sqrt(1-a²) is close to 1, but we need 1-a < sqrt(1-a²)\\n\\nAs computed, this holds for a ∈ (0,1), but let's find where the two curves intersect.\\n\\nSet 1-a = sqrt(1-a²)\\nSquare both sides: (1-a)^2 = 1 - a^2\\n1 - 2a + a^2 = 1 - a^2\\n-2a + a^2 = -a^2\\n2a^2 - 2a = 0\\n2a(a-1)=0\\nSo a=0 or a=1\\n\\nThus, for a ∈ (0,1), 1-a < sqrt(1-a²), so the interval (1-a, sqrt(1-a²)) is non-empty.\\n\\nHowever, b must also be ≤1, but sqrt(1-a²) ≤1, so ok.\\n\\nBut b must be in [0,1], and 1-a ≥0, sqrt(1-a²)≥0.\\n\\nNow, is sqrt(1-a²) > 1-a for a ∈ (0,1)? Yes, as established.\\n\\nBut we also need that the upper bound is greater than lower bound, which it is.\\n\\nHowever, b cannot exceed 1, but since sqrt(1-a²) ≤1, and 1-a ≥0, the constraint b < sqrt(1-a²) implies b<1, so no issue.\\n\\nBut b must be positive, and 1-a could be negative? No, a≤1, so 1-a≥0.\\n\\nWhen a>1, but a≤1. So for a ∈ [0,1], 1-a ∈ [0,1].\\n\\nBut when a <1, 1-a >0.\\n\\nThe only issue is that for b to exist, we need 1-a < sqrt(1-a²), which holds for a ∈ (0,1), but at endpoints measure zero.\\n\\nMoreover, we need b ≤1, but as said, upper limit is less than or equal to 1.\\n\\nBut actually, b is automatically ≤1 because we are in the unit square.\\n\\nSo for each a ∈ (0,1), the length of b interval is sqrt(1-a²) - (1-a), provided that this is positive, which it is for a ∈ (0,1).\\n\\nBut is that correct?\\n\\nb must be > 1-a and < sqrt(1-a²), and since the inequalities are strict, but in continuous space, the probability on boundary is zero, so we can use ≥ or > interchangeably.\\n\\nSo the area is ∫_{a=0}^1 [max(0, sqrt(1-a²) - (1-a)) ] da\\n\\nBut since for a ∈ (0,1), sqrt(1-a²) > 1-a, and at 0 and 1, difference is 0, so we can write:\\nArea = ∫_{a=0}^1 [sqrt(1-a²) - (1-a)] da\\n\\nIs that right? Only if sqrt(1-a²) > 1-a, which is true for a ∈ (0,1), and at endpoints 0, so yes.\\n\\nBut is the entire interval within [0,1]? b from 1-a to sqrt(1-a²), and since 1-a ≥0, and sqrt(1-a²) ≤1, and 1-a ≤1, so yes, b ∈ [0,1] throughout.\\n\\nFor example, a=0.5: 1-a=0.5, sqrt(1-0.25)=√0.75≈0.866, so b from 0.5 to 0.866, which is within [0,1].\\n\\nAt a=0: sqrt(1)-1=1-1=0\\nAt a=1: 0 - 0 =0\\n\\nSo yes.\\n\\nThus, area = ∫₀¹ [√(1−a²) − (1−a)] da\\n\\nSplit into two integrals:\\n= ∫₀¹ √(1−a²) da − ∫₀¹ (1−a) da\\n\\nSecond integral: ∫₀¹ (1−a) da = [a - a²/2]₀¹ = (1 - 1/2) - 0 = 1/2\\n\\nFirst integral: ∫₀¹ √(1−a²) da\\nThis is the area under the curve y=√(1−x²) from 0 to 1, which is a quarter circle of radius 1, but from 0 to 1, which is from (0,1) to (1,0), so it's exactly one-fourth of the disk x²+y²≤1 in the first quadrant.\\n\\nYes, because the full quarter circle from x=0 to x=1, y=0 to y=√(1−x²), area is (1/4)π(1)² = π/4\\n\\nSo ∫₀¹ √(1−a²) da = π/4\\n\\nThus, area = π/4 - 1/2\\n\\nThis is the area where a+b>1 and a²+b²<1.\\n\\nBut is this the probability? Since the total area is 1, yes.\\n\\nBut wait: is this correct? The region a+b>1 is a triangle of area 1/2, and we're taking a part of it.\\n\\nπ/4 ≈ 0.785, minus 0.5 = 0.285, which is positive, good.\\n\\nBut let me confirm with a point: say a=0.6, b=0.6: a+b=1.2>1, a²+b²=0.36+0.36=0.72<1, so should be included. In the integral, for a=0.6, b from 1-0.6=0.4 to √(1-0.36)=√0.64=0.8, so b=0.6 is in (0.4,0.8), yes.\\n\\nAnother point: a=0.9, b=0.9: a+b=1.8>1, a²+b²=0.81+0.81=1.62>1, so not included. Upper limit √(1-0.81)=√0.19≈0.436, lower limit 1-0.9=0.1, so b<0.436, but b=0.9>0.436, so not in, correct.\\n\\nNow, is there any restriction I missed? Earlier I assumed that the obtuse angle must be opposite the side of length 1. But could it be opposite a or b?\\n\\nSuppose, for example, that a is very close to 1, b is small. Say a=0.99, b=0.02. Then sides 0.99, 0.02, 1.\\nCheck triangle inequality: a+b=1.01>1, a+1=1.99>0.02, b+1=1.02>0.99? 1.02>0.99 yes.\\nNow, check angles:\\nOpposite to 1: 1² =1, a²+b²=0.9801 + 0.0004=0.9805<1 → so 1² > a²+b² → obtuse opposite 1.\\nBut is there another obtuse angle? Check opposite a=0.99: a²=0.9801, compare to b²+1²=0.0004+1=1.0004>0.9801, so acute.\\nOpposite b: b²=0.0004, vs a²+1²=0.9801+1=1.9801>0.0004, acute.\\nSo only one obtuse angle, opposite the longest side.\\n\\nBut what if a and b are both large, but a²+b²>1, but say a is very large and b small, but a≤1.\\nSuppose a=1, b=0.6. Then sides 1,0.6,1.\\nThen a+b=1.6>1, etc.\\na²+b²=1+0.36=1.36>1, so not obtuse opposite 1.\\nCheck opposite a=1: 1²=1, compare to b²+1²=0.36+1=1.36>1, so acute.\\nSimilarly opposite the other 1: same.\\nOpposite b=0.6: 0.36 vs 1²+1²=2>0.36, acute. So acute triangle.\\n\\nCan we have an obtuse triangle where the obtuse angle is not opposite the side of length 1?\\nSuppose the side of length 1 is not the longest? But a≤1, b≤1, so 1 is at least as long as a and b. If a<1 and b<1, then 1 is strictly longest. If a=1, b<1, then 1 is tied for longest, but as above, cannot be obtuse opposite a=1 because 1² =1, and other two sides b and 1, so b²+1² ≥1, equality only if b=0, but then not a triangle.\\nSpecifically, for angle opposite a=1 to be obtuse: 1² > b² + 1² → 1 > b² + 1 → 0 > b², impossible.\\nSimilarly if b=1.\\nSo indeed, the only possible obtuse angle is opposite the side of length 1, and it occurs iff 1² > a² + b², i.e., a² + b² < 1.\\n\\nAnd triangle inequality requires a+b>1 (and others automatic).\\n\\nSo the probability is the area we computed: π/4 - 1/2\\n\\nBut is this simplified? We can write as (π - 2)/4\\n\\nBut the problem asks for the probability, so we can leave it as π/4 - 1/2 or (π-2)/4.\\n\\nNumerically about 0.7854 - 0.5 = 0.2854\\n\\nBut let me confirm the integral.\\n\\nArea = ∫₀¹ √(1−a²) da − ∫₀¹ (1−a) da = π/4 − 1/2\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nWe can think geometrically: the area is the area of the quarter circle minus the area under the line a+b=1 from a=0 to 1.\\n\\nThe quarter circle has area π/4.\\nThe line a+b=1 from (0,1) to (1,0), the area under it (where b<1-a) is a triangle of area 1/2 *1*1 = 1/2, but wait no.\\n\\nIn the a-b plane, the region a≥0,b≥0,a≤1,b≤1.\\nThe line a+b=1.\\nThe region a+b≤1 is a triangle with vertices (0,0),(1,0),(0,1)? No: (0,0),(1,0),(0,1) is a+b≤1? At (1,0):1+0=1, (0,1):1, (0,0):0, so yes, the lower triangle, area 1/2.\\n\\nThe quarter circle a²+b²≤1, a≥0,b≥0, is entirely within the square since at a=1,b=0, etc.\\n\\nThe region we want is where a²+b²<1 and a+b>1.\\nWhich is the part of the disk in the first quadrant minus the part where a+b≤1.\\n\\nThe disk part in first quadrant is π/4.\\nThe part of this disk where a+b≤1 is a segment.\\nBut easier as we did: total disk quarter is π/4, subtract the part where a+b≤1 and a²+b²≤1.\\nBut in our calculation, we have area = ∫ [upper - lower] = area between the circle and the line, above the line.\\n\\nThe area under the circle from 0 to 1 is π/4.\\nThe area under the line b=1-a from 0 to 1 is ∫₀¹ (1-a) da = 1/2.\\nBut the region under the line is below b=1-a, while we want above it.\\n\\nOur desired region is bounded below by b=1-a and above by b=√(1-a²), for a from 0 to 1.\\nSo yes, the area is ∫₀¹ [√(1-a²) - (1-a)] da = π/4 - 1/2.\\n\\nGeometrically, it's the area of the circular segment.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo probability is π/4 - 1/2.\\n\\nBut let me write it as a single fraction: (π - 2)/4.\\n\\nEither is fine, but perhaps (π - 2)/4 is neater.\\n\\nNow, back to Problem 1: we got k=1.\\n\\nBut let me double-check.\\n\\nAfter eating A and C (the two endpoints of the top row), remaining: B,D,E,F.\\nInduced subgraph:\\n- B connected to E (since B was connected to A,C,E; A and C gone)\\n- D connected to E (D was connected to A,E; A gone)\\n- E connected to B,D,F\\n- F connected to E (F was connected to C,E; C gone)\\nSo edges: B-E, D-E, E-F.\\nSo F has only one neighbor, E, so degree 1.\\nThus deg(F)=1, k=1+0=1.\\n\\nThe problem says \\\"the induced subgraph on the remaining pieces after first eating the two endpoint pieces of the top row.\\\"\\nWe ate A and C, so remaining are B,D,E,F, and we found deg(F)=1.\\n\\nIs there any trick? It says \\\"first eating\\\", implying that we eat them first, but in some order? But since we remove both, the order doesn't matter for the remaining set.\\nAnd the induced subgraph depends only on which vertices are present, not the order eaten.\\nSo yes.\\n\\nAlso, the pieces are distinguishable, but since we're just looking at the graph structure, it shouldn't matter.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 1 is 1.\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 2 is (π - 2)/4.\\n\\nBut let me confirm the format.\\n\\nIt says: provide exact value.\\nSo (π - 2)/4 is exact.\\nWe can write as \\\\frac{\\\\pi - 2}{4}, but in the JSON, just text.\\n\\nSo in quotes: \\\"(π - 2)/4\\\" or \\\"\\\\frac{\\\\pi-2}{4}\\\"? But it says no LaTeX, so probably plain text.\\n\\nLooking back: \\\"no LaTeX formatting\\\", so use plain text.\\n\\nSo \\\"(π - 2)/4\\\" or \\\"pi/4 - 1/2\\\"? Either is acceptable, but perhaps (π - 2)/4 is better.\\n\\nSince π is a symbol, we can use pi.\\n\\nIn text, often written as pi.\\n\\nBut in the context, since it's a math problem, and π is standard, but in plain text, we might write pi.\\n\\nThe instruction says: \\\"provide your final answers in the exact JSON format\\\", and \\\"put ONLY the answer value in the quotes\\\", and \\\"for numerical answers, provide the exact value\\\".\\n\\nSo for irrational numbers, we use symbols.\\n\\nI think writing \\\"(π - 2)/4\\\" is fine, as π is a standard character.\\n\\nTo be safe, perhaps write as \\\"pi/4 - 1/2\\\" or \\\"(pi - 2)/4\\\".\\n\\nBut in the reasoning, I used π, so probably acceptable.\\n\\nLooking at the example: they had \"42\" and \"Monday\", so simple.\\n\\nBut for such answers, standard is to use fractions and pi.\\n\\nI think \\\"(π - 2)/4\\\" is acceptable.\\n\\nSome might write \\\\frac{\\\\pi-2}{4}, but that's LaTeX, forbidden.\\n\\nSo plain text: \\\"(π - 2)/4\\\"\\n\\nOr to avoid special characters, \\\"(pi - 2)/4\\\"\\n\\nI think either is fine, but since the problem likely expects the mathematical expression, and π is common, I'll use π.\\n\\nBut in code, sometimes pi is used.\\n\\nTo be safe, I'll use \\\"(π - 2)/4\\\"\\n\\nNow, for the JSON.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nanswer_1: \\\"1\\\"\\nanswer_2: \\\"(π - 2)/4\\\"\\n\\nBut in the box, it should be valid JSON.\\n\\nAlso, in the reasoning field, I need to put the entire reasoning as a string.\\n\\nSo I'll summarize the reasoning concisely in the reasoning string.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(π - 2)/4\"\n}",
