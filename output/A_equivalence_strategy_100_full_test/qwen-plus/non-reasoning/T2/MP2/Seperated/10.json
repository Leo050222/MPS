Our goal is to denest the nested radical $ \\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}} $ into the form $ a + \\\\sqrt{b} $, then compute $ k = a + 3 $.\\n\\nAssume:\\n$$\\n\\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}} = \\\\sqrt{m} + \\\\sqrt{n}\\n$$\\nfor some $ m, n $. Then squaring both sides:\\n$$\\n15 + \\\\sqrt{216} = (\\\\sqrt{m} + \\\\sqrt{n})^2 = m + n + 2\\\\sqrt{mn}\\n$$\\nMatching rational and irrational parts:\\n- $ m + n = 15 $\\n- $ 2\\\\sqrt{mn} = \\\\sqrt{216} $\\n\\nSquare the second equation:\\n$$\\n4mn = 216 \\\\Rightarrow mn = 54\\n$$\\nNow we solve:\\n- $ m + n = 15 $\\n- $ mn = 54 $\\n\\nThese are roots of the quadratic:\\n$$\\nx^2 - 15x + 54 = 0\\n$$\\nDiscriminant: $ 225 - 216 = 9 $, so:\\n$$\\nx = \\\\frac{15 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{9}}{2} = \\\\frac{15 \\\\pm 3}{2} \\\\Rightarrow x = 9 \\\\text{ or } 6\\n$$\\nSo $ m = 9, n = 6 $ (or vice versa).\\n\\nThus:\\n$$\\n\\\\sqrt{15 + \\\\sqrt{216}} = \\\\sqrt{9} + \\\\sqrt{6} = 3 + \\\\sqrt{6}\\n$$\\nTherefore, $ a = 3 $, $ b = 6 $, but the problem says $ a + \\\\sqrt{b} $, which matches.\\n\\nNow compute $ k = a + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 $.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nMark has a cursed six-sided die: it never rolls the same number twice in a row. All other outcomes are equally likely among the remaining five numbers.\\n\\nWe want the expected number of rolls to see all six numbers at least once.\\n\\nThis is a variation of the coupon collector problem with a Markovian constraint: no immediate repetition.\\n\\nLet $ E(S, last) $ be the expected number of additional rolls to collect all numbers, given current set $ S $ of seen numbers and last rolled number $ last $.\\n\\nBut due to symmetry, we can define states by:\\n- $ k $: number of distinct values seen so far (from 1 to 6)\\n- $ last $: the last number rolled, which affects transition probabilities\\n\\nHowever, because of symmetry among unseen/seen numbers, we can define $ E(k, \\\\text{last is in seen set}) $. But since we always roll from the current state, and the last roll is always one of the seen numbers, we can define $ E(k) $ as the expected number to finish from having seen $ k $ distinct numbers, with the last roll being one of them.\\n\\nLet $ E_k $ be the expected number of rolls to collect all 6 numbers starting from having seen $ k $ distinct numbers, and the last roll was one of them (so next roll cannot repeat it).\\n\\nBase case: $ E_6 = 0 $\\n\\nWe want $ E_1 $? No — actually, the process starts with the first roll. After the first roll, we have seen 1 number, and the last roll is that number.\\n\\nSo let’s define $ E_k $ for $ k = 1 $ to $ 6 $, with $ E_6 = 0 $.\\n\\nAt state $ k $, we have seen $ k $ numbers. The last roll was one of them. On the next roll, we pick uniformly at random from the other 5 numbers.\\n\\nOf the 5 possible outcomes (excluding the last number), how many are new?\\n- There are $ 6 - k $ unseen numbers.\\n- So probability of rolling a new number: $ \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} $\\n- Probability of rolling an old (but not last) number: $ \\\\frac{k - 1}{5} $\\n\\nIf we roll a new number, we move to state $ k+1 $, and now the last roll is the new number (which is now in the seen set).\\nIf we roll an old number, we stay in state $ k $, and last roll updates to that old number (still in seen set).\\n\\nSo the recurrence is:\\n$$\\nE_k = 1 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{6 - k}{5}\\\\right) E_{k+1} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{k - 1}{5}\\\\right) E_k\\n$$\\nSolve for $ E_k $:\\n$$\\nE_k - \\\\frac{k - 1}{5} E_k = 1 + \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1}\\n$$\\n$$\\nE_k \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{k - 1}{5}\\\\right) = 1 + \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1}\\n$$\\n$$\\nE_k \\\\left(\\\\frac{5 - (k - 1)}{5}\\\\right) = 1 + \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1}\\n$$\\n$$\\nE_k \\\\left(\\\\frac{6 - k}{5}\\\\right) = 1 + \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} E_{k+1}\\n$$\\nNow divide both sides by $ \\\\frac{6 - k}{5} $ (valid for $ k < 6 $):\\n$$\\nE_k = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{6 - k}{5}} + E_{k+1} = \\\\frac{5}{6 - k} + E_{k+1}\\n$$\\nSo:\\n$$\\nE_k = E_{k+1} + \\\\frac{5}{6 - k}\\n$$\\nThis is beautiful! So we can compute backwards:\\n- $ E_6 = 0 $\\n- $ E_5 = E_6 + \\\\frac{5}{1} = 5 $\\n- $ E_4 = E_5 + \\\\frac{5}{2} = 5 + 2.5 = 7.5 $\\n- $ E_3 = E_4 + \\\\frac{5}{3} = 7.5 + 1.666... = 9.166... $\\n- $ E_2 = E_3 + \\\\frac{5}{4} = 9.166... + 1.25 = 10.416... $\\n- $ E_1 = E_2 + \\\\frac{5}{5} = 10.416... + 1 = 11.416... $\\n\\nBut wait: does the process start at $ E_1 $? Yes: first roll gives us one number, and we are in state $ k=1 $, last roll is that number. But the first roll is free? No — we must count all rolls including the first.\\n\\nLet’s clarify:\\n- At roll 1: we get the first number. Now we are in state $ k=1 $, and we have used 1 roll.\\n- From there, expected additional rolls is $ E_1 $.\\n- So total expected rolls = $ 1 + E_1 $\\n\\nWait, no: our $ E_k $ is defined as the expected number **from** that state onward. So if $ E_1 $ is the expected number of rolls needed starting from having seen 1 number and last roll being it, then total expected number of rolls to see all six is $ 1 + E_1 $? No — because $ E_1 $ already includes the future rolls. Actually, $ E_1 $ is the expected number of rolls **starting from** that state until completion. So total expected rolls is just $ E_1 $? But that doesn’t include the first roll.\\n\\nWait: after the first roll, we are in state $ k=1 $. The process of collecting the rest takes $ E_1 $ more rolls. But the first roll is already done. So total expected number of rolls is $ 1 + E_1 $? No — $ E_1 $ is defined as the expected number **from** that point. So yes, total expected rolls = 1 (to get the first number) + $ E_1 $? But no: when we define $ E_k $, it should include all rolls from now until all are collected. So if we are at state $ k=1 $, $ E_1 $ is the expected number of rolls **from now on** to complete. Since we already made one roll to get to $ k=1 $, the total number of rolls will be $ 1 + E_1 $.\\n\\nBut actually, no: the definition of $ E_k $ should include the upcoming rolls. For example, $ E_5 $: we have 5 numbers, last roll is one of them. We need to roll until we get the last missing number. Each roll has $ \\\\frac{1}{5} $ chance to hit it (since only one of the five allowed numbers is new). So expected number of trials until success with probability $ p = \\\\frac{1}{5} $ is $ \\\\frac{1}{p} = 5 $. Which matches $ E_5 = 5 $. So $ E_5 = 5 $ means it takes 5 more rolls on average. So total rolls would be previous ones plus these 5.\\n\\nTherefore, $ E_k $ is the expected number of **additional** rolls needed.\\n\\nSo starting from scratch:\\n- Roll 1: we get first number. Now we are in state $ k=1 $. This roll is done.\\n- Then we need $ E_1 $ more rolls.\\n\\nSo total expected rolls = $ 1 + E_1 $\\n\\nBut wait — in our recurrence, $ E_1 $ is already the expected number from state $ k=1 $. So total = $ 1 + E_1 $? No: the 1 is already spent, and $ E_1 $ is the future cost. But actually, no: the first roll got us to $ k=1 $, and now we need $ E_1 $ more rolls. So total = $ 1 + E_1 $? But that would double-count.\\n\\nActually, no: $ E_1 $ is the expected number of rolls **starting from** the state where we have just rolled the first number. So the total number of rolls is exactly $ E_1 $? But that can't be, because $ E_1 $ assumes we are already in the state after one roll.\\n\\nClarify: our state definition is \\\"we have seen $ k $ numbers, and the last roll was one of them\\\". The process of rolling begins from this state. So $ E_k $ counts the number of rolls **from now on**.\\n\\nTherefore, to get to this state from scratch, we need one roll to get the first number. Then we are in state $ k=1 $, and expect $ E_1 $ more rolls.\\n\\nSo total expected number of rolls = $ 1 + E_1 $\\n\\nBut wait: when we are in state $ k=1 $, the next roll is the second roll. $ E_1 $ counts how many rolls from now — including the next roll.\\n\\nSo total rolls = 1 (first roll) + $ E_1 $ (subsequent rolls) = $ 1 + E_1 $\\n\\nBut let's verify with a smaller case. Suppose 2-sided die.\\n\\nFor $ n=2 $:\\n- After first roll: $ k=1 $, last = that number.\\n- Next roll: cannot repeat, so must roll the other number. So only one more roll needed.\\n- So $ E_1 = 1 $\\n- Total rolls = 1 + 1 = 2\\n\\nUsing recurrence:\\n$ E_2 = 0 $\\n$ E_1 = E_2 + \\\\frac{1}{2-1} \\\\cdot ? $\\nWait, general formula for $ n $-sided die:\\nFrom state $ k $, prob new = $ \\\\frac{n - k}{n - 1} $, prob old = $ \\\\frac{k - 1}{n - 1} $\\nThen:\\n$ E_k = 1 + \\\\frac{n-k}{n-1} E_{k+1} + \\\\frac{k-1}{n-1} E_k $\\nThen:\\n$ E_k (1 - \\\\frac{k-1}{n-1}) = 1 + \\\\frac{n-k}{n-1} E_{k+1} $\\n$ E_k \\\\cdot \\\\frac{n-k}{n-1} = 1 + \\\\frac{n-k}{n-1} E_{k+1} $\\nDivide both sides by $ \\\\frac{n-k}{n-1} $:\\n$ E_k = \\\\frac{n-1}{n-k} + E_{k+1} $\\nSo $ E_k = E_{k+1} + \\\\frac{n-1}{n-k} $\\nFor $ n=2 $:\\n$ E_2 = 0 $\\n$ E_1 = E_2 + \\\\frac{1}{1} = 1 $\\nTotal expected rolls = 1 (first roll) + $ E_1 $ = 2, which is correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, standard coupon collector without restriction is $ n H_n $, here it's different.\\n\\nBack to $ n=6 $:\\nWe have:\\n$ E_k = E_{k+1} + \\\\frac{5}{6 - k} $\\nSo:\\n- $ E_5 = E_6 + \\\\frac{5}{1} = 0 + 5 = 5 $\\n- $ E_4 = E_5 + \\\\frac{5}{2} = 5 + 2.5 = 7.5 $\\n- $ E_3 = E_4 + \\\\frac{5}{3} \\\\approx 7.5 + 1.6667 = 9.1667 $\\n- $ E_2 = E_3 + \\\\frac{5}{4} = 9.1667 + 1.25 = 10.4167 $\\n- $ E_1 = E_2 + \\\\frac{5}{5} = 10.4167 + 1 = 11.4167 $\\n\\nNow, total expected number of rolls = first roll + $ E_1 $ = 1 + 11.4167 = 12.4167?\\n\\nBut wait: no. $ E_1 $ is the expected number of rolls **starting from** state $ k=1 $. When we are in state $ k=1 $, we have already made one roll. $ E_1 $ is the expected number of **future** rolls to finish. So total rolls = 1 + $ E_1 $? That would be 1 + 11.4167 = 12.4167.\\n\\nBut in the $ n=2 $ case, $ E_1 = 1 $, total = 1 + 1 = 2, which is correct.\\n\\nBut actually, in the $ n=2 $ case, after first roll, we need exactly one more roll, so total is 2, and $ E_1 = 1 $, so total = 1 + $ E_1 $ = 2.\\n\\nBut is $ E_1 $ defined as the number of rolls from now, or including the current state?\\n\\nYes, $ E_1 $ is the expected number of rolls **to be made** from this point forward.\\n\\nTherefore, total expected number of rolls is:\\n- 1 (to get first number)\\n- plus $ E_1 $ (to get the rest)\\n= $ 1 + E_1 $\\n\\nBut wait: in our recurrence, when we compute $ E_1 $, it already includes the rolls we make from state $ k=1 $. For example, $ E_5 = 5 $: we make 5 rolls on average to get the last number. So total rolls would be previous ones plus these 5.\\n\\nBut we don't add an extra 1 for $ E_1 $; rather, the initial roll is separate.\\n\\nActually, no: the state $ k=1 $ is reached after one roll. $ E_1 $ is the expected number of **additional** rolls needed. So total = 1 + $ E_1 $\\n\\nBut let's compute $ E_1 $:\\n$ E_1 = 11.4167 = 11 + 5/12 = 137/12 $? Let's compute exactly.\\n\\nWe have:\\n$ E_5 = 5 = \\\\frac{5}{1} $\\n$ E_4 = 5 + \\\\frac{5}{2} = \\\\frac{10}{2} + \\\\frac{5}{2} = \\\\frac{15}{2} $\\n$ E_3 = \\\\frac{15}{2} + \\\\frac{5}{3} = \\\\frac{45}{6} + \\\\frac{10}{6} = \\\\frac{55}{6} $\\n$ E_2 = \\\\frac{55}{6} + \\\\frac{5}{4} = \\\\frac{110}{12} + \\\\frac{15}{12} = \\\\frac{125}{12} $\\n$ E_1 = \\\\frac{125}{12} + \\\\frac{5}{5} = \\\\frac{125}{12} + 1 = \\\\frac{125}{12} + \\\\frac{12}{12} = \\\\frac{137}{12} $\\n\\nSo $ E_1 = \\\\frac{137}{12} $\\n\\nThen total expected rolls = 1 + $ \\\\frac{137}{12} $ = $ \\\\frac{12}{12} + \\\\frac{137}{12} = \\\\frac{149}{12} $\\n\\nBut is this correct?\\n\\nWait: no. I think I made a mistake in the interpretation.\\n\\nWhen we are in state $ k=1 $, we have just rolled the first number. $ E_1 $ is the expected number of rolls **from now on** to complete the collection. So the total number of rolls will be $ 1 + E_1 $? No: the 1 is already done, and $ E_1 $ is the future rolls. So total = $ 1 + E_1 $\\n\\nBut in the $ n=2 $ case: $ E_1 = 1 $, total = 1 + 1 = 2, correct.\\n\\nBut let's simulate mentally: start, roll 1 (say), now k=1. Then we roll again: must be the other number, so we are done in 2 rolls. Expected = 2. Correct.\\n\\nNow for $ n=3 $:\\n$ E_3 = 0 $\\n$ E_2 = E_3 + \\\\frac{2}{1} = 2 $\\n$ E_1 = E_2 + \\\\frac{2}{2} = 2 + 1 = 3 $\\nTotal expected rolls = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nIs that correct?\\nAfter first roll: k=1, last=A\\nNext roll: choose uniformly from {B,C}, so always new. So we go to k=2, last=B or C.\\nNow, from k=2, last=B (say), seen {A,B}\\nNext roll: cannot be B, so choose from {A,C}, each with prob 1/2\\n- If C (new): done. Prob 1/2\\n- If A (old): back to k=2, last=A\\nSo $ E_2 = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{2}(0) + \\\\frac{1}{2} E_2' $, but by symmetry $ E_2' = E_2 $\\nSo $ E_2 = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} E_2 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{2} E_2 = 1 \\\\Rightarrow E_2 = 2 $, matches.\\nThen from start: roll 1: get first number (1 roll)\\nThen roll 2: get second number (guaranteed, since two choices, both new)\\nThen from there, expect 2 more rolls to get the last one\\nTotal: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4? But roll 2 is part of the process.\\nSequence:\\n- Roll 1: first number\\n- Roll 2: second number (since cannot repeat, and both others are new, so picks one)\\n- Then from there, expect $ E_2 = 2 $ more rolls\\nSo total rolls = 2 + 2 = 4? But roll 1 and 2 are already done, then 2 more, total 4.\\nBut after roll 2, we have two numbers, and we need one more, and expect 2 additional rolls, so total rolls = 2 + 2 = 4.\\nBut the first roll is 1, second is 2, then possibly third and fourth.\\nYes, so total expected number is 4.\\nAnd according to formula: 1 (initial) + $ E_1 $ = 1 + 3 = 4, correct.\\nBut $ E_1 = 3 $: what does it represent? From state k=1, expected additional rolls is 3.\\nIndeed: from k=1, we make one roll (roll 2) to get to k=2, then expect 2 more rolls, total 3 additional rolls. Yes.\\nSo total rolls = 1 (to enter k=1) + $ E_1 $ (to finish from there) = 1 + 3 = 4.\\nBut actually, the 1 to enter k=1 is roll 1, and $ E_1 $ includes roll 2 and beyond.\\nSo yes.\\nTherefore, for n=6, total expected rolls = 1 + $ E_1 $ = 1 + \\\\frac{137}{12} = \\\\frac{12}{12} + \\\\frac{137}{12} = \\\\frac{149}{12} $\\nBut is this right? In the recurrence, $ E_1 $ is computed as the expected number from state k=1, which requires making rolls. And we reach state k=1 after one roll.\\nSo total = 1 + \\\\frac{137}{12} = \\\\frac{149}{12} $\\nBut let me confirm the sum:\\n$ E_5 = 5 = \\\\frac{60}{12} $\\nBetter to compute $ E_1 $ directly:\\n$ E_k = \\\\sum_{i=k}^{5} \\\\frac{5}{6-i} $\\nSince $ E_k = E_{k+1} + \\\\frac{5}{6-k} $, so telescoping:\\n$ E_1 = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{5} \\\\frac{5}{6-j} = \\\\sum_{m=1}^{5} \\\\frac{5}{m} $ where $ m = 6-j $\\nWhen j=1, m=5; j=2, m=4; ... j=5, m=1\\nSo $ E_1 = \\\\sum_{m=1}^{5} \\\\frac{5}{m} = 5 \\\\sum_{m=1}^{5} \\\\frac{1}{m} = 5 H_5 $\\nHarmonic number $ H_5 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 = 1 + 0.5 + 0.333 + 0.25 + 0.2 = 2.2833 $\\nExactly: $ \\\\frac{60}{60} + \\\\frac{30}{60} + \\\\frac{20}{60} + \\\\frac{15}{60} + \\\\frac{12}{60} = \\\\frac{137}{60} $? Wait no:\\nCommon denominator 60:\\n1 = 60/60\\n1/2 = 30/60\\n1/3 = 20/60\\n1/4 = 15/60\\n1/5 = 12/60\\nSum: 60+30=90; +20=110; +15=125; +12=137 → 137/60\\nSo $ H_5 = 137/60 $\\nThen $ E_1 = 5 * (137/60) = 137/12 $, yes.\\nThen total expected rolls = 1 + 137/12 = 149/12\\nBut is this correct? In the sum, $ E_1 = \\\\sum_{m=1}^{5} \\\\frac{5}{m} = 5 H_5 $\\nBut intuitively, without restriction, coupon collector is $ 6 H_6 \\\\approx 6*2.45 = 14.7 $, here 149/12 ≈ 12.4167, which is less, makes sense because the restriction forces diversity, so might collect faster.\\nYes, plausible.\\nBut wait: in our earlier n=2 case: without restriction, expected rolls = 2*(1 + 1/2) = 3? No: standard coupon collector for n=2: expected time to see both: after first, expected additional rolls to get the other is 2 (geometric with p=1/2), so total 1 + 2 = 3.\\nBut with restriction: we cannot repeat, so after first, next roll must be the other, so total 2 rolls. Indeed less.\\nHere, 149/12 ≈ 12.4167 vs standard 6*H_6 = 6*(1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5+1/6)=6*(60/60+30/60+20/60+15/60+12/60+10/60)=6*(147/60)=6*2.45=14.7, and 12.4167 < 14.7, so yes, faster, makes sense.\\nTherefore, expected number is $ \\\\frac{149}{12} $\\nBut the problem asks to compute the expected number of rolls it takes for Mark to roll every number at least once.\\nThis includes the first roll.\\nAnd we have total = 1 + E_1 = 1 + 137/12 = 149/12\\nSo answer is $ \\\\frac{149}{12} $\\nBut let me write it as a fraction.\\nNow back to Problem 1: we found $ a = 3 $, so $ k = a + 3 = 6 $\\nAnswer: 6\\nProblem 2: $ \\\\frac{149}{12} $\\nBut in the recurrence, is $ E_1 $ really $ 5 H_5 $? \\n$ E_k = E_{k+1} + \\\\frac{5}{6-k} $\\nSo $ E_1 = \\\\frac{5}{5} + \\\\frac{5}{4} + \\\\frac{5}{3} + \\\\frac{5}{2} + \\\\frac{5}{1} = 5(\\\\frac{1}{5} + \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{2} + 1) = 5(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5) = 5 H_5 $, yes.\\nThen total rolls = 1 + 5 H_5 = 1 + 5*(137/60) = 1 + 685/60 = 1 + 137/12 = (12 + 137)/12 = 149/12\\nYes.\\nSo final answers:\\nProblem 1: k = 6\\nProblem 2: 149/12\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"6\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"149/12\"\n}",
