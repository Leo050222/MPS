  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We are asked to compute e = floor(550 / 12) - 43. First, compute floor(550 / 12). Dividing 550 by 12 gives approximately 45.833..., so the floor is 45. Then, e = 45 - 43 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: We need to find prime numbers p such that 5p = floor(n²/5) for some positive integer n. This means that there exists an integer n where:\\n\\n5p ≤ n²/5 < 5p + 1\\nMultiply all parts by 5:\\n25p ≤ n² < 25p + 5\\n\\nSo n² must be in the interval [25p, 25p+5). Since n² is an integer, we are looking for perfect squares in this range.\\n\\nWe can try small values of n and compute floor(n²/5), then check when that value is divisible by 5 and the quotient is a prime.\\n\\nLet’s compute floor(n²/5) for n from 1 upward and see when it's divisible by 5:\\n\\nn = 1: 1/5 = 0 → floor = 0 → 5p = 0 → p = 0 (not prime)\\nn = 2: 4/5 = 0.8 → 0 → p = 0\\nn = 3: 9/5 = 1.8 → 1 → not divisible by 5\\nn = 4: 16/5 = 3.2 → 3 → no\\nn = 5: 25/5 = 5 → 5 → 5p = 5 → p = 1 (not prime)\\nn = 6: 36/5 = 7.2 → 7 → no\\nn = 7: 49/5 = 9.8 → 9 → no\\nn = 8: 64/5 = 12.8 → 12 → no\\nn = 9: 81/5 = 16.2 → 16 → no\\nn = 10: 100/5 = 20 → 5p = 20 → p = 4 (not prime)\\nn = 11: 121/5 = 24.2 → 24 → no\\nn = 12: 144/5 = 28.8 → 28 → no\\nn = 13: 169/5 = 33.8 → 33 → no\\nn = 14: 196/5 = 39.2 → 39 → no\\nn = 15: 225/5 = 45 → 5p = 45 → p = 9 (not prime)\\nn = 16: 256/5 = 51.2 → 51 → no\\nn = 17: 289/5 = 57.8 → 57 → no\\nn = 18: 324/5 = 64.8 → 64 → no\\nn = 19: 361/5 = 72.2 → 72 → no\\nn = 20: 400/5 = 80 → 5p = 80 → p = 16 (not prime)\\nn = 21: 441/5 = 88.2 → 88 → no\\nn = 22: 484/5 = 96.8 → 96 → no\\nn = 23: 529/5 = 105.8 → 105 → 5p = 105 → p = 21 (not prime)\\nn = 24: 576/5 = 115.2 → 115 → 5p = 115 → p = 23 (prime!)\\nSo p = 23 is one solution.\\n\\nn = 25: 625/5 = 125 → 5p = 125 → p = 25 (not prime)\\nn = 26: 676/5 = 135.2 → 135 → 5p = 135 → p = 27 (no)\\nn = 27: 729/5 = 145.8 → 145 → 5p = 145 → p = 29 (prime!)\\nSo p = 29 is another.\\n\\nCheck if there are more:\\nn = 28: 784/5 = 156.8 → 156 → 156/5 = 31.2 → not integer\\nn = 29: 841/5 = 168.2 → 168 → not divisible by 5\\nn = 30: 900/5 = 180 → p = 36 (no)\\nn = 31: 961/5 = 192.2 → 192 → no\\nn = 32: 1024/5 = 204.8 → 204 → no\\nn = 33: 1089/5 = 217.8 → 217 → no\\nn = 34: 1156/5 = 231.2 → 231 → 231/5 = 46.2 → not integer\\nn = 35: 1225/5 = 245 → p = 49 (no)\\nn = 36: 1296/5 = 259.2 → 259 → no\\nn = 37: 1369/5 = 273.8 → 273 → no\\nn = 38: 1444/5 = 288.8 → 288 → no\\nn = 39: 1521/5 = 304.2 → 304 → no\\nn = 40: 1600/5 = 320 → p = 64 (no)\\n\\nSo far, only p = 23 and p = 29 work.
