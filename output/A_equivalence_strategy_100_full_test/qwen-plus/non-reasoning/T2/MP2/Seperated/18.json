A diameter passes through the center and connects two opposite points on the circle. Two diameters will intersect at the center, dividing the circle into sectors depending on the angles between them.\\n\\nLet’s analyze how many sectors are formed and how to maximize the smallest sector's area.\\n\\n- Each diameter contributes a line through the center.\\n- Two diameters create 4 rays from the center (since each diameter gives two opposite radii).\\n- Additionally, one more radius is drawn — so one extra ray from the center.\\n\\nThus, we have 4 (from two diameters) + 1 (extra radius) = 5 rays emanating from the center.\\nThese 5 rays divide the circle into 5 sectors.\\n\\nOur goal: Maximize the area of the smallest sector. That is, arrange the 5 rays such that the smallest of the 5 sector areas is as large as possible.\\n\\nSince area of a sector is (1/2) r² θ = (1/2)θ (since r=1), the area is proportional to the central angle θ.\\nSo we want to assign 5 positive angles θ₁, θ₂, ..., θ₅ such that:\\n- θ₁ + θ₂ + θ₃ + θ₄ + θ₅ = 2π\\n- The minimum θ_i is as large as possible\\n- But with geometric constraints: the rays come from two diameters and an extra radius.\\n\\nNow, crucially: a diameter means two opposite rays (separated by π radians).\\nSo if a ray is present, its opposite must also be present for it to be part of a diameter.\\n\\nWe have two diameters → four rays forming two pairs of antipodal rays.\\nPlus one additional radius → a fifth ray, which does not have its opposite unless it coincides with one of the existing ones (but then it wouldn't be distinct).\\nBut the problem says \\\"one radius\\\" — so just one additional ray, not necessarily aligned.\\n\\nHowever, since the two diameters already give us 4 rays in two opposite pairs, adding one more radius adds a fifth ray. But this fifth ray does not come with its opposite, so only five rays total.\\n\\nBut now, because diameters enforce symmetry: if a direction θ is present, then θ+π is also present.\\n\\nLet the directions of the rays be measured as angles from some fixed axis.\\nLet the two diameters be defined by angles α and β. Then the rays are at:\\nα, α+π, β, β+π\\nAnd the additional radius is at some angle γ.\\nSo the five rays are at: α, α+π, β, β+π, γ\\n\\nBut note: γ might coincide with one of the others, but probably we assume general position unless needed.\\nBut to maximize the minimal sector, we may want symmetry.\\n\\nNow, these 5 rays divide the circle into 5 sectors (since 5 rays → up to 5 sectors, assuming no overlaps).\\nBut because of antipodal symmetry, the configuration has constraints.\\n\\nNote: If γ is not equal to any of the other directions or their opposites, then all 5 rays are distinct.\\nBut α and α+π differ by π, same for β and β+π.\\n\\nThe key constraint: the set of rays must include both θ and θ+π whenever they belong to a diameter.\\n\\nNow, suppose we fix the two diameters. Without loss of generality, place one diameter along the x-axis: rays at 0 and π.\\nThe second diameter makes an angle φ with the first, so rays at φ and φ+π.\\nThen the extra radius is at some angle ψ.\\n\\nSo the five rays are at: 0, π, φ, φ+π, ψ\\n\\nWe can assume 0 < φ < π (since beyond π repeats), and ψ ∈ [0, 2π)\\n\\nNow sort these 5 angles modulo 2π to get the angular positions around the circle.\\nThen compute the 5 sector angles as differences between consecutive angles (with wrap-around).\\nThen find the minimum sector angle, and maximize that minimum over choices of φ and ψ.\\n\\nBut we want to maximize the minimum sector area.\\nSince area ∝ angle, we can work with angles.\\nTotal angle = 2π, divided into 5 sectors.\\nWe want to make the smallest sector as large as possible.\\nIdeally, all sectors equal: 2π/5 ≈ 1.2566 rad\\nBut can we achieve that?\\nThat would require the 5 rays to be equally spaced every 72° = 2π/5.\\nBut is that compatible with two diameters and one radius?\\n\\nSuppose the rays are at angles: 0, 72°, 144°, 216°, 288° (i.e., multiples of 72°)\\nCheck if this includes two full diameters.\\nA diameter requires two rays differing by 180°.\\nCheck pairs:\\n0 and 180? 180° is not in the list (144, 216 — no 180)\\n72 and 252? 252 not in list\\n144 and 324? not in list\\n216 and 36? not\\n288 and 108? not\\nSo no pair differs by 180° → no diameter at all!\\nSo this configuration doesn't even have one diameter.\\nThus, equally spaced rays won’t work because they don’t include antipodal pairs.\\n\\nWe need at least two diameters → at least two pairs of antipodal rays.\\nIn our 5 rays, we must have two pairs of rays separated by π.\\nBut 5 rays: two pairs (4 rays) that are antipodal, and one single ray.\\nThe single ray has no antipodal counterpart (unless it's at 90° or something and gets covered, but generally not).\\nSo the configuration must contain:\\n- Ray at α → must have α+π (diameter 1)\\n- Ray at β → must have β+π (diameter 2)\\n- Ray at γ → no requirement\\nSo rays: α, α+π, β, β+π, γ\\nAll distinct unless γ coincides.\\nNow, if γ is not equal to any of the others, we have 5 distinct rays.\\nNow, can these be arranged so that the five sector angles are as equal as possible?\\nWe suspect the optimal occurs when the configuration is symmetric.\\nTry to impose symmetry.\\nSuppose the two diameters are perpendicular: φ = π/2\\nThen rays at: 0, π, π/2, 3π/2, and ψ\\nSo current rays: 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°\\nThis divides the circle into 4 quadrants of 90° each.\\nNow add a fifth ray at angle ψ.\\nThis will split one of the 90° sectors into two parts.\\nSay we insert ψ in (0, π/2), e.g., at angle θ.\\nThen the sectors become:\\n- From ψ to 0: wait, need to sort angles.\\nAssume 0 < θ < π/2\\nSorted angles: 0, θ, π/2, π, 3π/2\\nWait: 0, θ, π/2, π, 3π/2\\nThen sectors:\\n- 0 to θ: size θ\\n- θ to π/2: size π/2 - θ\\n- π/2 to π: size π/2\\n- π to 3π/2: size π/2\\n- 3π/2 to 0 (i.e., 3π/2 to 2π): size π/2\\nBut 3π/2 to 2π is π/2, and 2π to 0 is identified, but next after 3π/2 should go to 0? Wait, sorted order should be circular.\\nAfter 3π/2, the next is 0 (since 0 is equivalent to 2π)\\nBut 3π/2 = 270°, 0 = 360°, so difference is 90° = π/2\\nBut we have a ray at 0, so sector from 3π/2 to 0 is π/2\\nBut we also have a sector from 0 to θ: size θ\\nSo sectors are:\\n1. 3π/2 → 0: size π/2\\n2. 0 → θ: size θ\\n3. θ → π/2: size π/2 - θ\\n4. π/2 → π: size π/2\\n5. π → 3π/2: size π/2\\nSo the five sector angles: π/2, θ, π/2 - θ, π/2, π/2\\nSo values: θ, π/2 - θ, and three of π/2\\nThe smallest sector is min(θ, π/2 - θ)\\nTo maximize this minimum, set θ = π/4\\nThen min = π/4\\nSo smallest sector angle is π/4, area = (1/2)(1)²(π/4) = π/8\\nBut is this the best possible?\\nSmallest sector area = π/8\\nBut maybe we can do better with non-perpendicular diameters.\\nSuppose the two diameters are not perpendicular.\\nLet the angle between them be φ, so rays at 0, π, φ, φ+π\\nWithout loss of generality, assume 0 < φ < π/2 (by symmetry)\\nThen the four rays divide the circle into 4 sectors:\\n- 0 to φ: φ\\n- φ to π: π - φ\\n- π to φ+π: φ (since φ+π - π = φ)\\n- φ+π to 2π (i.e., 0): 2π - (φ+π) = π - φ\\nSo two sectors of size φ, two of size π - φ\\nSince φ < π/2, φ < π - φ, so smaller sectors are size φ\\nNow add a fifth ray at angle ψ.\\nWe can choose ψ to split one of the larger sectors to help balance.\\nThe largest sectors are size π - φ > π/2 > φ\\nSo to increase the minimum, we should split a large sector.\\nSuppose we place ψ in one of the sectors of size π - φ, say between φ and π.\\nLet ψ = φ + x, where 0 < x < π - φ\\nThen this splits the sector (φ to π) into two: φ to ψ: x, and ψ to π: (π - φ) - x\\nSimilarly, due to rotational symmetry, but the opposite side: between φ+π and 2π (i.e., 0), there is another sector of size π - φ\\nBut we are only adding one ray, so only one split.\\nSo after adding ψ in (φ, π), the five rays are: 0, φ, ψ, π, φ+π\\nSorted: 0, φ, ψ, π, φ+π\\nThen sectors:\\n1. 0 → φ: size φ\\n2. φ → ψ: size x\\n3. ψ → π: size (π - φ) - x\\n4. π → φ+π: size φ (since φ+π - π = φ)\\n5. φ+π → 0 (i.e., 2π): size 2π - (φ+π) = π - φ\\nSo sector sizes:\\n- φ\\n- x\\n- (π - φ) - x\\n- φ\\n- π - φ\\nWe want to maximize the minimum of these five.\\nWe can choose x and φ.\\nNote that π - φ appears once, and φ appears twice.\\nSince φ < π/2, π - φ > π/2 > φ, so π - φ is large, not likely to be minimum.\\nSimilarly, we can adjust x.\\nThe candidates for minimum are: φ, x, (π - φ) - x\\nWe want to maximize min{ φ, x, (π - φ) - x }\\nFor fixed φ, we can choose x to maximize the min of x and (π - φ) - x\\nThe best is to set x = (π - φ)/2, so both are (π - φ)/2\\nThen the three values are: φ, (π - φ)/2, (π - φ)/2\\nSo min is min{ φ, (π - φ)/2 }\\nWe want to maximize this min over φ ∈ (0, π/2)\\nSet f(φ) = min{ φ, (π - φ)/2 }\\nFind φ that maximizes f(φ)\\nSet φ = (π - φ)/2 → solve for equality\\nφ = (π - φ)/2\\n2φ = π - φ\\n3φ = π\\nφ = π/3\\nThen (π - φ)/2 = (π - π/3)/2 = (2π/3)/2 = π/3\\nSo both equal π/3\\nNow φ = π/3 < π/2? Yes, π/3 ≈ 1.047, π/2 ≈ 1.57, so yes.\\nThen min = π/3\\nNow check all sector sizes:\\n- φ = π/3\\n- x = (π - φ)/2 = (π - π/3)/2 = (2π/3)/2 = π/3\\n- (π - φ) - x = π/3\\n- φ = π/3\\n- π - φ = π - π/3 = 2π/3\\nSo sector sizes: π/3, π/3, π/3, π/3, 2π/3\\nSo four sectors of π/3, one of 2π/3\\nThus the smallest sector angle is π/3\\nArea = (1/2) r² θ = (1/2)(1)²(π/3) = π/6\\nEarlier with perpendicular diameters we got π/8 ≈ 0.3927, now π/6 ≈ 0.5236, much better.\\nIs this valid?\\nWe have rays at:\\nFrom diameters: 0, π, φ=π/3, φ+π=4π/3\\nAnd ψ in (φ, π) = (π/3, π), specifically ψ = φ + x = π/3 + π/3 = 2π/3\\nSo ψ = 2π/3\\nNow, is this ray part of a diameter? No, it's the extra radius.\\nNow, list all rays: 0, π/3, 2π/3, π, 4π/3\\nSorted: 0, π/3, 2π/3, π, 4π/3\\nSectors:\\n- 0 to π/3: π/3\\n- π/3 to 2π/3: π/3\\n- 2π/3 to π: π/3\\n- π to 4π/3: π/3\\n- 4π/3 to 2π (i.e., 0): 2π - 4π/3 = 2π/3\\nYes, matches.\\nNow, is there any issue? The extra radius is at 2π/3, and its opposite would be 2π/3 + π = 5π/3, which is not among the rays. So it's not part of a diameter, fine.\\nAnd we have two diameters: one along 0-π, one along π/3 - 4π/3 (since 4π/3 = π/3 + π), yes.\\nSo valid.\\nSmallest sector area is π/6.\\nCan we do better?\\nSuppose we try to make the minimum larger than π/3.\\nCurrently min angle is π/3, and we have one large sector of 2π/3.\\nIf we could split that large sector, but we have no more rays to add.\\nCould we place the extra radius in a different location?\\nFor example, instead of splitting a large sector, could we split the small one? But that would make smaller sectors, worse.\\nOr, what if the two diameters are closer together?\\nSuppose φ > π/3, but earlier we assumed φ < π/2.\\nAt φ = π/3, we got min = π/3.\\nWhat if φ > π/3?\\nBut earlier we assumed φ < π/2, but actually, without loss of generality, we can assume φ ≤ π/2, because if φ > π/2, we can relabel.\\nBut let’s see what happens if φ > π/3.\\nIn our earlier analysis, for φ < π/2, we set x = (π - φ)/2, then min{ φ, (π - φ)/2 }\\nNow, if φ > π/3, then (π - φ)/2 < (π - π/3)/2 = π/3, and φ > π/3, so min is (π - φ)/2 < π/3\\nSimilarly, if φ < π/3, then φ < π/3, and (π - φ)/2 > π/3, so min is φ < π/3\\nOnly at φ = π/3 do we get min = π/3\\nSo indeed, maximum min is π/3\\nBut is there another configuration?\\nWhat if we place the extra radius not in the large sector, but elsewhere?\\nFor example, suppose we place it in a small sector.\\nBut that would split a sector of size φ into two smaller ones, making the minimum even smaller, which is worse.\\nCould we place it at a position that creates more balance?\\nAnother idea: what if the extra radius is placed such that it aligns with an existing ray? But then it's not an additional distinct ray, probably not intended, and would reduce the number of sectors.\\nOr, could the extra radius be at a point where it helps symmetry?\\nNotice in our current setup, we have rays at 0, π/3, 2π/3, π, 4π/3\\nMissing 5π/3 = -π/3\\nIf we had a ray at 5π/3, it would complete symmetry, but we don’t.\\nBut we only have five rays.\\nAnother thought: could the two diameters be the same? But then it's only one diameter, but the problem says two diameters, probably distinct.\\nEven if same, then rays at 0, π, 0, π, and extra radius — so only three distinct rays, dividing into 3 sectors, but problem says dividing into 5 sectors, so must have 5 distinct rays, so diameters must be distinct and not overlapping.\\nSo our configuration seems optimal.\\nThus, smallest sector angle is π/3, area is (1/2)*1²*(π/3) = π/6\\nBut wait: area of sector is (1/2) r² θ, yes, r=1, so area = θ/2\\nAngle θ, area = (1/2) θ\\nSo for θ = π/3, area = (1/2)(π/3) = π/6\\nYes.\\nSo largest possible area of the smallest sector is π/6\\nThus, expressed as (a/b) π, we have a/b = 1/6, so a=1, b=6, relatively prime.\\nNow, the problem says: instead of computing 100a+b, find k where k is four greater than the denominator of that fraction.\\nDenominator is 6, so k = 6 + 4 = 10\\nBut let me confirm.\\nThe fraction is 1/6, denominator b=6, k = b + 4 = 10\\nBut is this correct?\\nIn our configuration, smallest sector area is π/6\\nBut is there a way to get a larger smallest sector?\\nSuppose we try to make all sectors closer.\\nTotal area π, 5 sectors, average area π/5 = 0.2π ≈ 0.628\\nOur smallest is π/6 ≈ 0.1667π, which is less than average, but we want to maximize the minimum.\\nIs it possible to have minimum larger than π/6?\\nSuppose minimum area is A, then each sector ≥ A, sum = π, so 5A ≤ π ⇒ A ≤ π/5\\nSo upper bound is π/5\\nCan we achieve close to π/5?\\nThat would require all sectors about π/5 in angle, so angles about 2π/5 = 72°\\nBut we need two pairs of antipodal rays.\\nSuppose we have rays at angles θ_i, and for two of them, θ_j and θ_j + π are both present, similarly for another pair.\\nSuppose the five rays include two antipodal pairs.\\nLet the rays be at α, α+π, β, β+π, γ\\nThe angular separations must include differences of π for the diameter pairs.\\nNow, the sum of adjacent angles is 2π.\\nSuppose we want all sector angles ≥ δ, and maximize δ.\\nWith the antipodal constraints.\\nNote that if there is a ray at α, there is one at α+π.\\nSimilarly for β.\\nNow, the ray at γ has no antipode.\\nConsider the circle. The presence of antipodal pairs imposes symmetry.\\nIn particular, the configuration is symmetric under 180° rotation only if γ is also paired, but it's not.\\nHowever, the set {α, α+π, β, β+π} is symmetric under 180° rotation.\\nAdding γ breaks the symmetry, unless γ is at a point where γ+π is also present, but it's not.\\nSo the configuration is not symmetric under 180° rotation.\\nBut perhaps we can still achieve better than π/6.\\nTry to set the angles.\\nSuppose we want the five sector angles to be as equal as possible, say all 2π/5 = 72°\\nBut 5 * 72° = 360°, good.\\nBut can we have such a division with two diameters?\\nThat is, among the five rays, are there two pairs separated by 180°?\\nSuppose the rays are at angles: 0°, 72°, 144°, 216°, 288°\\nCheck differences:\\n216° - 36°? Not in list.\\n0 and 180? 180 not in list.\\n72 and 252? 252 not.\\n144 and 324? 324 mod 360 = 324, not in list (we have 288, 0, etc.)\\n216 and 36? 36 not.\\n288 and 108? 108 not.\\nNo pair differs by 180°, so no diameter.\\nSuppose we force one diameter. Say rays at 0° and 180°.\\nThen we need three more rays: β, β+180°, and γ? No: we have two diameters, so we need another pair: say at δ and δ+180°, but that would be four rays: 0,180,δ,δ+180\\nThen plus one more radius γ, so five rays.\\nSame as before.\\nSo rays: 0, 180, δ, δ+180, γ\\nNow, we want the five sector angles to be equal, each 72°.\\nBut the rays must be at positions that are multiples of 72° apart?\\nList the required positions.\\nSuppose the rays are at angles that are multiples of 72°.\\nPossible angles: 0,72,144,216,288\\nWe must include 0 and 180, but 180 is not a multiple of 72? 72*2.5=180, not integer, so 180° not in the set {0,72,144,216,288}\\nIndeed, 180 mod 360 not equal to any of those.\\nSo cannot have a ray at 180° if all are multiples of 72°.\\nThus, impossible to have equally spaced rays including a diameter.\\nSo cannot achieve equal sectors.\\nNow, back to our earlier configuration with min angle π/3 ≈ 60°, while 72° is larger, but unattainable.\\nCan we get min angle larger than 60°?\\nSuppose we try to set the min to 65°, for example.\\nBut let's use the earlier parameterization.\\nWe had min sector angle = min{ φ, (π - φ)/2 } maximized at π/3 when φ=π/3.\\nBut is there another way to place the extra radius?\\nSuppose instead of placing it in the large sector between φ and π, we place it in the other large sector, between φ+π and 2π.\\nBut by symmetry, same thing.\\nSuppose we place it such that it creates a different configuration.\\nAnother idea: what if the two diameters are not independent, but share a ray? But a diameter is defined by two opposite rays, so if they share a ray, say both diameters pass through 0, then the other ends must be at 180°, so both diameters are the same. But then only one diameter, contradiction.\\nSo diameters must be distinct, so four distinct rays from the two diameters.\\nNow, the extra radius adds a fifth.\\nNow, in our earlier config, we have sector angles: π/3, π/3, π/3, π/3, 2π/3\\nMin is π/3\\nBut the large sector is 2π/3, which is big.\\nIf we could place the extra radius to split that large sector, but in our case, the large sector is from 4π/3 to 0, i.e., from 240° to 360°.\\nWe placed the extra radius at 2π/3 = 120°, which is not in that sector.\\nCould we place it in the sector from 4π/3 to 0?\\nThat sector is from 240° to 360°, size 120° = 2π/3\\nCurrently, without extra ray, the sectors are:\\n- 0 to φ: φ\\n- φ to π: π - φ\\n- π to φ+π: φ\\n- φ+π to 0: π - φ\\nWith φ=π/3, sizes: 60°, 120°, 60°, 120°\\nWe added the extra radius in one of the 120° sectors, say between φ and π, i.e., 60° to 180°, and set it at 120°, splitting into two 60° sectors.\\nWe could instead add it in the other 120° sector, between φ+π=240° and 0=360°, i.e., 240° to 360°.\\nPlace ψ in (240°, 360°), say at angle ψ.\\nSet ψ = 240° + x = 4π/3 + x, with 0<x<120°=2π/3\\nThen it splits the sector into: 240° to ψ: x, and ψ to 360°: (120° - x)\\nThen the five rays: 0, 60°, 180°, 240°, ψ\\nSorted: 0, 60°, 180°, 240°, ψ\\nBut ψ > 240°, and ψ < 360°, so if ψ < 360°, and 0 is next, but in order: 0, 60, 180, 240, ψ, then back to 0?\\nBut ψ < 360°, so after ψ comes 0 (360°), so sector from ψ to 0: 360° - ψ\\nAnd from 0 to 60°: 60°\\nBut we have a ray at 0, so sectors:\\n1. 240° → ψ: size ψ - 240° = x\\n2. ψ → 0: size 360° - ψ = 360° - (240° + x) = 120° - x\\n3. 0 → 60°: 60°\\n4. 60° → 180°: 120°\\n5. 180° → 240°: 60°\\nSo sizes: x, 120°-x, 60°, 120°, 60°\\nTo maximize min, set x=60°, then sizes: 60°,60°,60°,120°,60° — same as before: four 60°, one 120°\\nMin still 60°.\\nSame result.\\nNow, can we get a min larger than 60°?\\nSuppose we choose a different φ.\\nEarlier we optimized and got max min at φ=π/3.\\nBut suppose we place the extra radius not in a large sector, but in a way that balances differently.\\nAnother idea: what if the extra radius is placed at a position that is symmetric, but we already did.\\nSuppose the two diameters are at 0-180 and 90-270, so perpendicular.\\nRays at 0,90,180,270\\nSectors: 90° each.\\nAdd extra radius at ψ.\\nTo maximize min sector, place it to split one 90° sector into two equal 45° parts.\\nThen sectors: 45°,45°,90°,90°,90° — min is 45° < 60°, worse.\\nPlace it not in the middle.\\nSet ψ in (0,90), say at θ.\\nThen sectors:\\n- 270→0: 90°\\n- 0→θ: θ\\n- θ→90: 90-θ\\n- 90→180: 90°\\n- 180→270: 90°\\nMin is min(θ,90-θ), maximized at 45° when θ=45°.\\nStill 45° < 60°.\\nSo worse.\\nSuppose we try φ close to π/2.\\nSay φ=80°.\\nThen sectors without extra ray: 80°, 100°, 80°, 100° (since π-φ=100°)\\nAdd extra ray in a 100° sector, set to split into two 50° parts.\\nThen sizes: 80°,50°,50°,80°,100°? Wait.\\nAfter split: suppose split the sector from φ to π (80° to 180°) into two 50° parts, so at 130°.\\nThen rays: 0,80,130,180,260 (since φ+π=80+180=260)\\nSorted: 0,80,130,180,260\\nSectors:\\n- 0→80: 80°\\n- 80→130: 50°\\n- 130→180: 50°\\n- 180→260: 80°\\n- 260→360: 100° (since 360-260=100)\\nSo sizes: 80,50,50,80,100\\nMin is 50° < 60°\\nWorse.\\nIf we split the other 100° sector, same.\\nNow, what if we place the extra radius not in a large sector, but... but that would make min smaller.\\nSuppose we place it such that it creates a smaller min, but allows adjustment, but unlikely.\\nAnother configuration: suppose the extra radius is very close to an existing ray, but then one sector becomes very small, min decreases.\\nSo seems π/3 is best.\\nBut earlier I thought area is π/6, but let me confirm the area.\\nSector angle θ = π/3 radians.\\nArea = (1/2) r^2 θ = (1/2)(1)^2 (π/3) = π/6\\nYes.\\nAs fraction: (1/6) π, so a=1,b=6.\\nDenominator b=6.\\nk = b + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.\\nBut the problem says \\\"compute 100a+b\\\" but then says instead find k where k is four greater than the denominator.\\nSo k=10.\\nBut is this correct?\\nI recall that in the sector from 4π/3 to 0, which is from 240° to 360°, size 120°, but in our calculation, we have a sector of 2π/3 = 120°, yes.\\nBut is there a way to make that smaller?\\nSuppose we choose φ such that the large sector is smaller, but then the small sectors might be smaller.\\nSuppose we set φ larger, but as before, min decreases.\\nAnother idea: what if the extra radius is placed at a point that is not in one of the original sectors, but we have to place it somewhere.\\nPerhaps if the two diameters are almost parallel, but then φ small, then sectors: φ, π-φ≈π, φ, π-φ≈π\\nThen adding extra radius in a large sector, split into two of about π/2 each.\\nThen sizes: φ, π/2, π/2, φ, π-φ≈π\\nMin is min(φ, π/2, π) ≈ min(φ, 1.57), but φ small, so min is φ, which is small.\\nWorse.\\nSo indeed, maximum min sector angle is π/3, area π/6.\\nThus denominator is 6, k=6+4=10.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nFind the smallest integer greater than 10 such that the sum of the digits in its base 17 representation equals the sum of the digits in its base 10 representation.\\n\\nLet n > 10 be integer.\\nLet s10(n) = sum of digits of n in base 10.\\ns17(n) = sum of digits of n in base 17.\\nWant s10(n) = s17(n), and n>10, smallest such.\\n\\nNote that for any n, s_b(n) ≡ n mod (b-1), by the divisibility rule.\\nSpecifically, in base b, sum of digits ≡ n mod (b-1).\\nBecause b ≡ 1 mod (b-1), so b^k ≡ 1^k =1 mod (b-1), so digit times b^k ≡ digit mod (b-1), so sum ≡ n mod (b-1).\\n\\nSo s10(n) ≡ n mod 9\\ns17(n) ≡ n mod 16\\n\\nWe want s10(n) = s17(n)\\nBut they are congruent to n modulo 9 and 16 respectively.\\nSo s10(n) ≡ n mod 9\\ns17(n) ≡ n mod 16\\nAnd s10(n) = s17(n) = s, say\\nThen s ≡ n mod 9\\ns ≡ n mod 16\\nSo n ≡ s mod 9 and n ≡ s mod 16\\nSince 9 and 16 coprime, by Chinese remainder theorem, n ≡ s mod 144\\nBecause lcm(9,16)=144.\\n\\nAlso, for any n, s10(n) ≥ 1, and s10(n) ≤ 9 * (number of digits)\\nSimilarly for s17(n), but since base 17, digits 0-16, so sum of digits in base 17 is at most 16 * floor(log17 n) + 16, but roughly O(log n)\\nWhile n grows, but s is roughly proportional to log n, while n ≡ s mod 144, so n - s is divisible by 144.\\nSince s is much smaller than n for large n, n - s ≈ n, so n must be close to a multiple of 144.\\nBut for small n, we can check.\\n\\nStart checking from n=11 upwards.\\nBut perhaps we can find when s10(n) = s17(n)\\nNote that s17(n) is generally smaller than s10(n) for small n, but not always.\\nFor example, n=11: base 10: '11', sum=1+1=2\\nBase 17: 11 < 17, so 'B' or 11, sum=11\\n2 ≠ 11\\nn=12: s10=1+2=3, s17=12 (since 12<17), 3≠12\\n...\\nn=16: s10=1+6=7, s17=16, 7≠16\\nn=17: base 10: '17', sum=1+7=8\\nBase 17: 17=1*17 + 0, so '10'_17, sum=1+0=1 ≠8\\nn=18: s10=1+8=9, s17=18=1*17+1, so '11'_17, sum=1+1=2≠9\\nn=19: s10=1+9=10, s17=19=1*17+2, '12'_17, sum=1+2=3≠10\\n...\\nn=26: s10=2+6=8, s17=26=1*17+9, '19'_17, sum=1+9=10≠8\\nn=27: s10=2+7=9, s17=27=1*17+10, '1A'_17 (A=10), sum=1+10=11≠9\\nn=28: s10=2+8=10, s17=28=1*17+11, '1B'_17, sum=1+11=12≠10\\nn=29: s10=2+9=11, s17=29=1*17+12, '1C'_17, sum=1+12=13≠11\\nn=30: s10=3+0=3, s17=30=1*17+13, '1D'_17, sum=1+13=14≠3\\nn=31: s10=3+1=4, s17=31=1*17+14, '1E'_17, sum=1+14=15≠4\\nn=32: s10=3+2=5, s17=32=1*17+15, '1F'_17, sum=1+15=16≠5\\nn=33: s10=3+3=6, s17=33=1*17+16, '1G'_17 (G=16), sum=1+16=17≠6\\nn=34: s10=3+4=7, s17=34=2*17+0, '20'_17, sum=2+0=2≠7\\nn=35: s10=3+5=8, s17=35=2*17+1, '21'_17, sum=2+1=3≠8\\n...\\nThis is taking time. Note that s17(n) for n<17^2=289 is at most 16+16=32, since two digits, each <=16.\\nSimilarly, s10(n) for n<100 is at most 9+9=18, for n>=100, up to 9*3=27 for n<1000, etc.\\nBut s17(n) grows slower.\\nWe need s10(n)=s17(n)\\nFrom above, for n=17 to 33, s17(n) >=1, but often larger than s10(n)? In n=17, s17=1, s10=8; n=18,s17=2,s10=9; ... up to n=33,s17=17,s10=6; so s17 > s10 for n=27 to 33.\\nAt n=34, s17=2, s10=7, so s17 < s10\\nSimilarly, for larger n, s17(n) is usually smaller.\\nBut we need them equal.\\nSince n ≡ s mod 144, and s = s10(n) ≈ digit sum, which for n around 100 is about 10, so n ≡ s mod 144, so if s is small, n is close to multiple of 144.\\nSmallest n>10, so start from small n.\\nBut perhaps check multiples of 144, but n ≡ s mod 144, s is digit sum, so for n near k*144, s is small compared to n, so n - s ≈ n, so n must be close to a multiple of 144, but since s >=1, n >= s, so n > s, so n - s >=0, and divisible by 144, so n - s = 0 or 144 or 288, etc.\\nBut n - s =0 implies n=s, but s is digit sum, so for n>9, s < n, so n-s >0, so n-s >=144\\nThus n >= s + 144\\nBut s = s10(n) <= 9 * floor(log10 n) + 9\\nFor n around 144, s10(n) <= 1+4+4=9 for n=144, but 9+144=153, so n>=153? \\nn >= s + 144, and s >=1, but more tightly, s is at least the digit sum.\\nFor example, if n=144, s10(144)=1+4+4=9, so n - s =144-9=135, not divisible by 144.\\nBut we need n - s divisible by 144, so n - s >=144, so n >= s + 144 >= 1 + 144 =145\\nMoreover, since s <= 9 * d where d is number of digits, for n<1000, d<=3, s<=27, so n >= s + 144 <= 27+144=171, so n >=145, and n <= ? well, s could be small, but n must be at least 145.\\nActually n >= s + 144, and s >=1, so n>=145\\nBut s depends on n, so we need to find n such that n - s10(n) is divisible by 144, and s10(n) = s17(n)\\nBut from earlier, we have that s10(n) = s17(n) implies n ≡ s mod 144, so n - s ≡ 0 mod 144, so yes.\\nSo necessary condition is that n - s10(n) is divisible by 144.\\nMoreover, since s17(n) ≡ n mod 16, and s10(n) ≡ n mod 9, and if they are equal, then as above.\\nBut for the equality to hold, we need both the congruence and the actual sum to match.\\nBut we can first find n>10 such that n - s10(n) is divisible by 144, and then check if s10(n) = s17(n)\\nNow, n - s10(n) is divisible by 9, always, because s10(n) ≡ n mod 9, so n - s10(n) ≡ 0 mod 9.\\nBut we need divisible by 144=16*9, so we need additionally divisible by 16.\\nSo n - s10(n) ≡ 0 mod 16\\nBut n - s10(n) ≡ 0 mod 9 always, so we need n - s10(n) ≡ 0 mod 16\\nNow, s10(n) is the sum of digits in base 10.\\nWe can compute for n starting from 145 upwards, but perhaps find when n - s10(n) is divisible by 144.\\nSince 144 is not too big, we can consider that n - s10(n) is a multiple of 144, and n - s10(n) >=144, as established.\\nSmallest possible n - s10(n) =144\\nSo let d = n - s10(n) =144\\nThen n = s10(n) + 144\\nNow, s10(n) is sum of digits of n.\\nLet s = s10(n), then n = s + 144\\nNow, s is sum of digits of s+144\\nNow, s+144 is a number, and we need its digit sum to be s.\\nNow, s+144 >=145, as before.\\nNow, what is the range of s?\\nFor a number m = s+144, with s = digit sum of m.\\nDigit sum s satisfies s ≡ m mod 9, but m = s+144, 144≡0 mod 9, so s ≡ s+0 mod 9, always true.\\nNow, m = s+144\\ns is at least 1, but for m>=145, s >=1+4+5=10? m=145, s=1+4+5=10\\nBut s = digit sum, so for m, s <= 9 * floor(log10 m) +9\\nm = s+144, so s <= 9 * floor(log10 (s+144)) +9\\nSince s+144 >=145, floor(log10) >=2, so s <= 9*2 +9=27 for m<1000, i.e., s+144<1000, s<856, but tighter.\\nAssume m<1000, so s+144<1000, s<856, but s is digit sum, so s<=27 for three-digit numbers.\\nSimilarly, for larger, but start with s<=27.\\nSo s from, say, 10 to 27.\\nThen m = s + 144\\nCompute digit sum of m, see if equals s.\\nMake a table:\\ns | m=s+144 | digits of m | s10(m) | equal to s?\\n10 | 154 | 1,5,4 | 1+5+4=10 | yes! 10=10\\nOh! So for s=10, m=154, digit sum=1+5+4=10=s\\nSo n=154\\nNow, check if s10(n) = s17(n)\\ns10(154)=1+5+4=10\\nNow s17(154): convert 154 to base 17.\\n17^2=289>154, so two digits.\\n17*9=153, since 17*9=153\\n154 - 153=1, so 154 = 9*17 + 1, so digits 9,1\\nSum=9+1=10\\nYes! 10=10\\nSo s10(n)=10, s17(n)=10, equal.\\nNow, is this greater than 10? Yes, 154>10.\\nIs it the smallest? We assumed n - s10(n) =144, but could there be smaller n with n - s10(n) =0? But earlier we said n>s for n>9, so n - s >0, and next multiple is 144, since 0 not possible.\\nBut n - s10(n) could be 144, 288, etc.\\nBut 144 is the smallest positive multiple, so n >= s + 144 >=1 +144=145, and we found n=154>145.\\nBut is there n with n - s10(n) =144 and n<154?\\nFrom above, we have s from 10 to 27, m=s+144\\nWe started s=10, m=154, works.\\nBut are there smaller m? s=10 gives m=154\\ns=11, m=155, digit sum=1+5+5=11, yes! 11=11\\nSo n=155\\nBut 155>154, larger.\\ns=12, m=156, digit sum=1+5+6=12, yes, n=156>154\\ns=13, m=157, 1+5+7=13, yes\\n...\\ns=18, m=162, 1+6+2=9? 1+6+2=9 ≠18\\nWhen does it stop?\\nm=s+144\\nFor s=10, m=154, sum=10\\ns=11,155,sum=11\\ns=12,156,sum=12\\ns=13,157,sum=13\\ns=14,158,sum=14\\ns=15,159,sum=15\\ns=16,160,sum=1+6+0=7≠16\\ns=17,161,sum=1+6+1=8≠17\\ns=18,162,sum=1+6+2=9≠18\\ns=19,163,sum=1+6+3=10≠19\\netc.\\nSo only for s=10 to 15, we have digit sum equal to s.\\nCorresponding n=154,155,156,157,158,159\\nAll greater than 154 except 154 itself.\\nBut is there any n with n - s10(n) = 288? Then n = s + 288, s >=1, n>=289\\nBut 289>154, so larger than 154.\\nSimilarly, higher multiples larger.\\nBut is it possible that for some n, n - s10(n) is divisible by 144, but not equal to 144? For example, 0, but not possible.\\nOr negative, but n - s10(n) >=0, and for n>9, >0.\\nBut could be 144*k for k>=2, but then n>= s + 288 >=289>154.\\nBut what if n - s10(n) = 144, but we missed some n?\\nIn our list, for s=10 to 15, we have n=154 to 159.\\nBut is there n<154 with n - s10(n) divisible by 144?\\nBut earlier we said n - s10(n) >=144 for n>9, but is that true?\\nn - s10(n) is divisible by 9, and we need divisible by 144=16*9, so by 16 as well.\\nBut n - s10(n) could be 0, but only for n<10, like n=1, s=1, n-s=0; but n>10 required.\\nNext multiple is 144, then 288, etc.\\nBut could n - s10(n) = 144, but n<154?\\nFrom above, n = s + 144, and s = s10(n), so for n<154, s+144<154, so s<10\\nBut s = s10(n), and n>10, so s>=1, but for n>=10, s>=1, but s<10.\\nNow, n = s + 144 < 10 + 144 = 154, so n<154\\nBut n = s + 144, and s<10, so n<154\\nNow, s = s10(n) = s10(s+144)\\nNow, s<10, so s is digit 1 to 9.\\nn = s + 144\\ns+144 >=1+144=145\\nSo n>=145\\nNow, s<10, so n<154\\nSo 145 <= n <= 153\\nn = s + 144, s = n - 144\\ns must be sum of digits of n.\\nSo for each n from 145 to 153, compute s10(n), and see if s10(n) = n - 144\\nn=145: s10=1+4+5=10, n-144=145-144=1, 10≠1\\nn=146:1+4+6=11, 146-144=2, 11≠2\\nn=147:1+4+7=12, 147-144=3, no\\nn=148:1+4+8=13, 148-144=4, no\\nn=149:1+4+9=14, 149-144=5, no\\nn=150:1+5+0=6, 150-144=6, yes! 6=6\\nOh! So for n=150, s10(n)=6, n - s10(n)=150-6=144, divisible by 144.\\nNow, check if s10(n) = s17(n)\\ns10(150)=1+5+0=6\\ns17(150): 17^2=289>150, so two digits.\\n17*8=136, 150-136=14, so 8*17 + 14, so digits 8 and 14 (E), sum=8+14=22 ≠6\\nNot equal.\\nSo although the congruence condition is satisfied (n ≡ s mod 144, here s=6, n=150, 150-6=144, yes), but s17(n)=22 ≠6=s10(n)\\nSo not equal.\\nSimilarly, continue.\\nn=151: s10=1+5+1=7, n-144=151-144=7, yes 7=7\\ns17(151): 17*8=136, 151-136=15, so 8*17+15, digits 8,15 (F), sum=8+15=23≠7\\nn=152: s10=1+5+2=8, n-144=8, yes\\ns17:152-136=16, so 8*17+16, digits 8,16 (G), sum=8+16=24≠8\\nn=153: s10=1+5+3=9, n-144=9, yes\\ns17:153-136=17? 17*9=153, yes, so 9*17 +0, digits 9,0, sum=9+0=9\\ns10=9, so 9=9!

So n=153, s10=1+5+3=9, s17=9+0=9, equal.\\nAnd n=153>10.\\nNow, compare to earlier n=154.\\n153<154, so smaller.\\nBut earlier I thought n>=145, and 153<154.\\nBut in my initial search, I didn't reach 153 yet, but now we have it.\\nIs there any smaller?\\nn=153 is less than 154.\\nBut are there others smaller than 153?\\nWe have n from 145 to 153 with n - s10(n) divisible by 144, which requires n - s10(n) =144, since 0 not possible, and 288 too big.\\nSo only possibilities are n where n - s10(n) =144, i.e., s10(n) = n - 144\\nAnd n>=145\\nWe checked n=145 to 153:\\n145: s10=10, n-144=1, no\\n146:11 vs 2, no\\n147:12 vs 3, no\\n148:13 vs 4, no\\n149:14 vs 5, no\\n150:6 vs 6, yes, but s17=22≠6\\n151:7 vs 7, yes, s17=23≠7\\n152:8 vs 8, yes, s17=24≠8\\n153:9 vs 9, yes, s17=9=9, yes\\nSo only n=153 and n=150,151,152 satisfy the congruence, but only n=153 has s10=s17.\\nBut earlier for n=154 to 159, we also have n - s10(n)=144? For n=154, s10=10, n-144=10, yes 154-144=10, and s10=10, so yes.\\nSimilarly, n=155: s10=11, n-144=11, yes\\nBut n=155>153, so larger.\\nBut n=153 is smaller.\\nIs there any n<153 that satisfies the original condition without satisfying the congruence? But earlier we derived that s10(n)=s17(n) implies n ≡ s mod 144, so the congruence is necessary.\\nBecause s10(n) ≡ n mod 9, s17(n) ≡ n mod 16, and if equal, then n ≡ s mod 9 and n ≡ s mod 16, so n ≡ s mod lcm(9,16)=144.\\nSo yes, necessary.\\nTherefore, only possibilities are when n - s10(n) is divisible by 144, and since n>10, n - s10(n) >=144, so n>=145, and we checked all from 145 to 153, and only n=153 works besides the larger ones.\\nBut n=153 works.\\nBut is there any n with n - s10(n) = 288? Then n = s + 288, s = s10(n)\\nn >=289, s <= 2+8+9=19 for n=289, but s+288>=289, s>=1\\nBut n= s+288 >=289\\nNow, s = s10(s+288)\\nFor example, s=1, n=289, s10=2+8+9=19≠1\\ns=2,n=290,s10=2+9+0=11≠2\\n...\\nBut n=289>153, so even if it works, larger than 153.\\nSimilarly, higher.\\nBut just to confirm, is there any n<153 that we missed?\\nWhat about n=144? But n>10, but 144>10, but n - s10(n)=144 - (1+4+4)=144-9=135, not divisible by 144? 135 / 144 <1, not integer.\\nAnd 135 mod 144 =135 ≠0.\\nSimilarly, n=143: s10=1+4+3=8, n-s=135, not div by 144.\\nBut we need n>=145 for n-s>=144.\\nBut n-s could be 0, but not for n>9.\\nOr negative, impossible.\\nSo no.\\nThus, smallest n is 153.\\nBut earlier I thought 154, but 153 is smaller and works.\\nConfirm: n=153\\nBase 10: 153, digits 1,5,3, sum=1+5+3=9\\nBase 17: 17^2=289>153, so highest power 17^1=17\\n153 / 17 = 9, since 17*9=153, remainder 0\\nSo digits: 9, 0, so '90'_17\\nSum=9+0=9\\nEqual to 9.\\nYes.\\nAnd greater than 10.\\nIs there any smaller n>10? We think not, by the necessity of the congruence.\\nBut just to be sure, suppose there is n<153 with s10(n)=s17(n)\\nThen n ≡ s mod 144, with s=s10(n)\\nSince n<153, and n>=11, s>=1, n-s >=0\\nn-s ≡0 mod 144\\nn-s <153-1=152<144? 152<144? No, 152>144, but n-s could be 0 or 144\\nIf n-s=0, then n=s, so n is equal to its digit sum, which for n>9 only possible if n<10, but n>10, contradiction. (e.g., n=10, s=1+0=1≠10; n=11,s=2≠11, etc.)\\nIf n-s=144, then n=s+144>=145, as before, so n>=145\\nBut 145>153? No, 145<153, but we checked n=145 to 152, and only n=153 works in that range? n=153 is included, but n=145 to 152 we checked, and for those, either the congruence doesn't hold or s17≠s10.\\nSpecifically, for n=145 to 152, n-s10(n) is not 144, except for n=150,151,152 where it is 144, but s17≠s10.\\nFor example, n=144: s10=9, n-s=135, not div by 144.\\nn=143: s10=8, n-s=135, same.\\nn=142:1+4+2=7,142-7=135\\n... down to n=136:1+3+6=10,136-10=126, not div by 144.\\nWhen is n-s10(n) divisible by 144? Only when it's 0,144,288,...\\n0 not possible for n>9\\n144: n=s+144, with s=s10(n), and we solved for n>=145, and found solutions at n=150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159\\nAmong these, s17(n)=s10(n) only for n=153 and n=154? Earlier n=154: s10=10, s17=9+1=10, yes, but larger than 153.\\nn=155: s10=11, s17=155/17=9*17=153, rem 2, so 9*17+2, digits 9,2, sum=11, yes! 9+2=11\\nSimilarly, n=156:17*9=153, rem 3, digits 9,3, sum=12, s10=1+5+6=12, yes\\nn=157: rem 4, sum=9+4=13, s10=1+5+7=13, yes\\nn=158: rem 5, sum=14, s10=1+5+8=14, yes\\nn=159: rem 6, sum=15, s10=1+5+9=15, yes\\nAnd n=150: s10=6, s17=8*17=136, 150-136=14, so 8,14, sum=22≠6\\nn=151:8,15,sum=23≠7\\nn=152:8,16,sum=24≠8\\nn=153:9,0,sum=9=9, yes\\nSo the n that satisfy both conditions are: 153,154,155,156,157,158,159\\nSmallest is 153.\\nSo answer is 153.\\n\\nBut in problem 1, we have k=10\\nProblem 2, n=153\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"10\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"153\"\n}",
