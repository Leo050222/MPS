Then the length is $ l = 3w $.\\n\\nPerimeter $ P = 2(l + w) = 2(3w + w) = 2(4w) = 8w $.\\n\\nArea $ A = l \\\\cdot w = 3w \\\\cdot w = 3w^2 $.\\n\\nWe are told that the perimeter and area are numerically equal to the same value $ k > 0 $, so:\\n\\n$ 8w = 3w^2 $\\n\\nAssuming $ w \\\\neq 0 $ (since $ k > 0 $), divide both sides by $ w $:\\n\\n$ 8 = 3w $\\n\\n$ w = \\\\frac{8}{3} $\\n\\nNow compute $ d = w + \\\\frac{37}{3} = \\\\frac{8}{3} + \\\\frac{37}{3} = \\\\frac{45}{3} = 15 $.\\n\\nSo $ d = 15 $.\\n\\n---\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nLet the ladder have length $ L $ feet. Initially, the base is 15 feet from the house, so let the height on the wall be $ h $. Then by the Pythagorean theorem:\\n\\n$ L^2 = 15^2 + h^2 = 225 + h^2 $.\\n\\nAfter pulling the base 9 feet farther away, it's now $ 15 + 9 = 24 $ feet from the house, and the top slides down 13 feet, so the new height is $ h - 13 $.\\n\\nAgain by Pythagorean theorem:\\n\\n$ L^2 = 24^2 + (h - 13)^2 = 576 + (h - 13)^2 $\\n\\nSet the two expressions for $ L^2 $ equal:\\n\\n$ 225 + h^2 = 576 + (h - 13)^2 $\\n\\nExpand the right-hand side:\\n\\n$ 225 + h^2 = 576 + h^2 - 26h + 169 $\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n$ 225 + h^2 = 745 + h^2 - 26h $\\n\\nSubtract $ h^2 $ from both sides:\\n\\n$ 225 = 745 - 26h $\\n\\n$ 26h = 745 - 225 = 520 $\\n\\n$ h = \\\\frac{520}{26} = 20 $\\n\\nNow plug back into the first equation:\\n\\n$ L^2 = 15^2 + 20^2 = 225 + 400 = 625 $\\n\\n$ L = \\\\sqrt{625} = 25 $\\n\\nSo the ladder is 25 feet long.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"15\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"25\"\n}",
