Let p_N be the probability that the product of their two numbers has a units digit of 0 — that is, the product is divisible by 10.\\n\\nFor the product to have units digit 0, it must be divisible by both 2 and 5.\\n\\nLet A be the number chosen by Michael, B by Kylo. We want P(10 | AB).\\n\\nSince A and B are independent and uniform over {1, 2, ..., N},\\n\\np_N = (1/N²) × number of pairs (a,b) ∈ [N]×[N] such that ab ≡ 0 mod 10.\\n\\nWe want to analyze the maximum possible value of p_N over all N.\\n\\nNote: The behavior of divisibility by 2 and 5 depends on the residue classes modulo 2 and 5. Since 10 = 2×5, and we need both factors present in the product.\\n\\nWe can use complementary probability:\\n\\nP(ab not divisible by 10) = P(ab not divisible by 2 OR ab not divisible by 5)\\n\\nBut inclusion-exclusion might get messy. Instead, compute directly:\\n\\nP(ab ≡ 0 mod 10) = 1 - P(ab not divisible by 2) - P(ab not divisible by 5) + P(ab divisible by neither 2 nor 5)? No — better:\\n\\nActually:\\nP(ab ≡ 0 mod 10) = 1 - P(ab not divisible by 2 or not divisible by 5)\\n= 1 - [P(ab not div by 2) + P(ab not div by 5) - P(ab not div by 2 and not div by 5)]\\n\\nBut perhaps easier to compute directly the probability that ab is divisible by both 2 and 5.\\n\\nLet’s define:\\n- E2: ab divisible by 2\\n- E5: ab divisible by 5\\nThen p_N = P(E2 ∩ E5) = 1 - P(E2^c ∪ E5^c) = 1 - [P(E2^c) + P(E5^c) - P(E2^c ∩ E5^c)]\\n\\nSo:\\np_N = 1 - P(ab odd) - P(ab not divisible by 5) + P(ab odd and not divisible by 5)\\n\\nNow compute each term asymptotically as N → ∞, but since we’re looking for the maximum over N, we should consider how these probabilities behave depending on N mod 10 or mod lcm(2,5)=10.\\n\\nBut note: the maximum p_N may occur in the limit as N→∞, or at some finite N.\\n\\nLet’s analyze the limiting probability as N → ∞.\\n\\nAs N → ∞, the probability that a random number is even → 1/2, odd → 1/2.\\nSimilarly, divisible by 5 → 1/5, so not divisible by 5 → 4/5.\\n\\nP(ab odd) = P(a odd and b odd) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\\n\\nP(ab not divisible by 5) = P(neither a nor b divisible by 5)? No:\\nab not divisible by 5 iff a not divisible by 5 AND b not divisible by 5 → (4/5)^2 = 16/25\\n\\nWait: no! ab not divisible by 5 iff 5 does not divide ab, which happens iff 5 divides neither a nor b? No: if either a or b is divisible by 5, then ab is divisible by 5. So ab not divisible by 5 iff both a and b are not divisible by 5.\\nYes, so P(ab not divisible by 5) = (4/5)^2 = 16/25\\n\\nSimilarly, P(ab odd) = P(a odd) P(b odd) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\\n\\nP(ab odd and not divisible by 5) = P(a odd and not div by 5, and same for b)\\n\\nLet’s define the set of integers that are odd and not divisible by 5.\\nIn any block of 10 consecutive integers, the odd ones are: 1,3,5,7,9\\nRemove those divisible by 5: remove 5 → left with 1,3,7,9 → 4 out of 10\\nSo density = 4/10 = 2/5\\nSo P(a odd and not div by 5) → 2/5 as N→∞\\nThus P(ab odd and not div by 5) = (2/5)^2 = 4/25\\n\\nTherefore, in the limit:\\np_∞ = 1 - 1/4 - 16/25 + 4/25 = 1 - 0.25 - 0.64 + 0.16 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75; 0.75 - 0.64 = 0.11; 0.11 + 0.16 = 0.27?\\nWait: no:\\np_N → 1 - P(ab odd) - P(ab not div by 5) + P(ab odd and not div by 5)\\n= 1 - 1/4 - 16/25 + 4/25\\nCompute exactly:\\n1 - 1/4 = 3/4 = 75/100\\n16/25 = 64/100, 4/25 = 16/100\\nBetter fractions:\\n= 1 - 1/4 - 16/25 + 4/25 = 1 - 1/4 - 12/25\\nNow compute:\\nLCM of 4 and 25 is 100\\n= 100/100 - 25/100 - 48/100 = (100 - 25 - 48)/100 = 27/100\\n\\nSo limit is 27/100 = 0.27\\n\\nBut is this the maximum? Or can we get higher for finite N?\\n\\nWait: maybe for small N we can get higher probability.\\n\\nBut intuitively, as N increases, the distribution stabilizes, and fluctuations average out. But let's test small N.\\n\\nAlternatively, note that to maximize p_N, we want many numbers divisible by 2 and 5.\\nSuppose N is a multiple of 10. Then in 1 to N, there are:\\n- Numbers divisible by 2: floor(N/2) ≈ N/2\\n- Divisible by 5: N/5\\n- Divisible by 10: N/10\\n\\nBut we need the product ab to be divisible by 10.\\n\\nWe can compute p_N = P(10 | ab)\\n= 1 - P(ab not div by 2) - P(ab not div by 5) + P(ab not div by 2 and not div by 5)\\nSame as before.\\n\\nDefine:\\nf(N) = P(ab odd) = [number of odd a / N]^2 → let o_N = number of odd integers in [N]\\no_N = ceil(N/2) or floor((N+1)/2)\\nSimilarly, let q_N = number of integers in [N] not divisible by 5 → floor(4N/5) or similar\\nAnd r_N = number of integers in [N] that are odd and not divisible by 5\\n\\nThen:\\np_N = 1 - (o_N/N)^2 - (q_N/N)^2 + (r_N/N)^2\\n\\nWe want to maximize this over N.\\n\\nAs N→∞, this tends to 1 - (1/2)^2 - (4/5)^2 + (2/5)^2 = 1 - 1/4 - 16/25 + 4/25 = 1 - 1/4 - 12/25\\n= (100 - 25 - 48)/100 = 27/100 = 0.27\\n\\nBut can we get higher than 27/100?\\n\\nTry N=10:\\nNumbers: 1 to 10\\nOdd numbers: 1,3,5,7,9 → 5 → o_N = 5\\nNot divisible by 5: 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 → 8 → q_N = 8\\nOdd and not div by 5: 1,3,7,9 → 4 → r_N = 4\\nThen p_10 = 1 - (5/10)^2 - (8/10)^2 + (4/10)^2 = 1 - 0.25 - 0.64 + 0.16 = 0.27\\nSame as limit.\\n\\nTry N=5:\\no_N = number of odd: 1,3,5 → 3\\nq_N = not div by 5: 1,2,3,4 → 4\\nr_N = odd and not div by 5: 1,3 → 2\\np_5 = 1 - (3/5)^2 - (4/5)^2 + (2/5)^2 = 1 - 9/25 - 16/25 + 4/25 = 1 - (9+16-4)/25 = 1 - 21/25 = 4/25 = 0.16 < 0.27\\n\\nN=4:\\no_N = 2 (1,3)\\nq_N = 4 (none divisible by 5)\\nr_N = 2 (1,3)\\np_4 = 1 - (2/4)^2 - (4/4)^2 + (2/4)^2 = 1 - 0.25 - 1 + 0.25 = 0\\nMakes sense: max number is 4, so no multiple of 5, so ab never divisible by 5, hence never by 10.\\n\\nN=6:\\no_N = 3 (1,3,5)\\nq_N = 5 (not 5)\\nr_N = 2 (1,3) — 5 is odd and divisible by 5, so excluded\\np_6 = 1 - (3/6)^2 - (5/6)^2 + (2/6)^2 = 1 - 0.25 - (25/36) + (4/36) = 1 - 0.25 - 21/36\\n= 0.75 - 7/12 = (9/12 - 7/12) = 2/12 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667\\n\\nN=10 gives 0.27\\n\\nTry N=20:\\no_N = 10\\nq_N = 16 (since 4 multiples of 5: 5,10,15,20)\\nr_N = ? odd and not div by 5: odds: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19 → 10\\nRemove those div by 5: 5,15 → left with 8\\nSo r_N = 8\\np_20 = 1 - (10/20)^2 - (16/20)^2 + (8/20)^2 = 1 - 0.25 - 0.64 + 0.16 = 0.27 again\\n\\nSeems consistent.\\n\\nBut is there an N where it's higher?\\n\\nTry N=25:\\no_N = 13 (since (25+1)/2 = 13)\\nq_N = 25 - 5 = 20 (multiples of 5: 5,10,15,20,25)\\nr_N = number of odd numbers not divisible by 5\\nOdds from 1 to 25: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25 → 13\\nAmong them, divisible by 5: 5,15,25 → 3\\nSo r_N = 10\\nThen:\\np_25 = 1 - (13/25)^2 - (20/25)^2 + (10/25)^2 = 1 - (169/625) - (400/625) + (100/625) = (625 - 169 - 400 + 100)/625 = (625 - 569 + 100)/625? Wait: 625 - 169 = 456; 456 - 400 = 56; 56 + 100 = 156\\nSo 156/625\\nCompute: 156 ÷ 625 = 0.2496 < 0.27\\nWorse.\\n\\nTry N=15:\\no_N = 8 (odds: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15)\\nq_N = 15 - 3 = 12 (multiples of 5: 5,10,15)\\nr_N = odd and not div by 5: total odd 8, minus 5,15 → 6\\np_15 = 1 - (8/15)^2 - (12/15)^2 + (6/15)^2 = 1 - 64/225 - 144/225 + 36/225 = (225 - 64 - 144 + 36)/225 = (225 - 208 + 36)/225? 225 - 64 = 161; 161 - 144 = 17; 17 + 36 = 53 → 53/225 ≈ 0.2355 < 0.27\\n\\nTry N=1 to 10: already did, 0.27\\n\\nWhat about N=1? p_1 = 0 (only 1×1=1, not div by 10)\\nN=2: no multiple of 5 → p=0\\n...\\nN=5: only possible if one picks 5 and other picks even, but max even is 4? Numbers: 1,2,3,4,5\\nEven: 2,4\\nSo favorable: (5,2),(5,4),(2,5),(4,5) → 4 cases\\nTotal: 25\\np_5 = 4/25 = 0.16, matches earlier.\\n\\nNow, is 27/100 achievable? Yes, at N=10,20, etc.\\nBut is it the maximum?\\n\\nSuppose we try to make more numbers divisible by 10. But even if all numbers are divisible by 10, say N=10, numbers 10,20,...,10k, but they are choosing from 1 to N, so unless N≥10, but even then, not all are divisible by 10.\\n\\nBut suppose N=10, and we have:\\nTo have ab divisible by 10, need ab divisible by 2 and 5.\\nCases:\\n- a divisible by 10: then any b works\\n- a divisible by 2 but not 5, b divisible by 5\\n- a divisible by 5 but not 2, b divisible by 2\\n- a not divisible by 2 or 5, b divisible by 10\\n\\nBut easier to count complement.\\nFrom earlier calculation using inclusion, we got 0.27, and it seems consistent.\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"the maximum possible value of p_N\\\", and we see that for N multiple of 10, we get 27/100, and for others less or equal.\\n\\nBut wait: try N=9\\nThen no multiple of 10, but multiples of 5: only 5\\nEven numbers: 2,4,6,8 → 4\\nOdd: 1,3,5,7,9 → 5\\nNot div by 5: 8 numbers (all except 5)\\nOdd and not div by 5: 1,3,7,9 → 4\\np_9 = 1 - (5/9)^2 - (8/9)^2 + (4/9)^2 = 1 - 25/81 - 64/81 + 16/81 = (81 - 25 - 64 + 16)/81 = (97 - 89)/81? 81-25=56; 56-64=-8; -8+16=8 → 8/81 ≈ 0.0988\\nLow.\\n\\nN=11:\\no_N = 6\\nq_N = 11 - 2 = 9 (5,10)\\nr_N = odd not div by 5: odds:1,3,5,7,9,11; remove 5 → 5\\np_11 = 1 - (6/11)^2 - (9/11)^2 + (5/11)^2 = 1 - 36/121 - 81/121 + 25/121 = (121 - 36 - 81 + 25)/121 = (146 - 117)/121? 121-36=85; 85-81=4; 4+25=29 → 29/121 ≈ 0.2397 < 0.27\\n\\nSo seems 27/100 is the highest observed.\\n\\nBut is there an N where the proportion of numbers divisible by 2 is higher? For example N even, it's exactly 1/2. If N odd, (N+1)/(2N) > 1/2, but then q_N might be worse.\\n\\nBut in the expression:\\np_N = 1 - (o_N/N)^2 - (q_N/N)^2 + (r_N/N)^2\\n\\no_N ≥ N/2, q_N ≥ 4N/5 - 1, etc., but the squared terms make deviations penalize.\\n\\nNote that in the limit, it's 27/100, and at N=10,20 it's exactly 27/100, and elsewhere less, so likely the maximum is 27/100.\\n\\nBut the problem says: instead of computing 100a+b, simply find e = k + 1973/100, where k is the maximum p_N from upper bound analysis.\\n\\nIt says: \\\"simply find e = (k + 1973/100), where k is the maximum possible value of p_N derived from the upper bound analysis\\\"\\n\\nSo k = 27/100\\nThen e = 27/100 + 1973/100 = (27 + 1973)/100 = 2000/100 = 20\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 1 is 20.\\n\\nBut let me confirm: is 27/100 indeed the maximum?\\n\\nSuppose we want to maximize p_N = P(10 | ab)\\nThis is maximized when the set {1,...,N} contains many multiples of 2 and 5.\\nThe optimal might be when N is multiple of 10, and in that case, as computed, p_N = 27/100.\\n\\nWe can compute exactly for N=10:\\nTotal pairs: 100\\nCount number of pairs (a,b) such that ab divisible by 10.\\nab divisible by 10 iff ab divisible by 2 and 5.\\nUse inclusion or direct count.\\n\\nEasier: total - (ab not div by 2) - (ab not div by 5) + (ab not div by 2 and not div by 5)\\nab not div by 2: both a and b odd → 5 choices each → 25\\nab not div by 5: both not div by 5 → 8 choices each → 64\\nab not div by 2 and not div by 5: both odd and not div by 5 → 4 choices (1,3,7,9) → 16\\nSo number of bad pairs: 25 + 64 - 16 = 73\\nThus good pairs: 100 - 73 = 27\\nSo p_10 = 27/100, yes.\\n\\nIs there any N with more than 27%?\\nTry N=100:\\no_N = 50\\nq_N = 80 (since 20 multiples of 5)\\nr_N = number of odd not div by 5: in 1 to 100, odds: 50\\nAmong odds, divisible by 5: 5,15,25,...,95 → 10 numbers (every other multiple of 5)\\nSo r_N = 40\\nThen p_100 = 1 - (50/100)^2 - (80/100)^2 + (40/100)^2 = 1 - 0.25 - 0.64 + 0.16 = 0.27 again.\\n\\nAlways 0.27 when N divisible by 10.\\n\\nIf N=10m + r, the counts fluctuate but don't exceed.\\n\\nSo maximum is 27/100.\\n\\nThus k = 27/100\\ne = k + 1973/100 = (27 + 1973)/100 = 2000/100 = 20\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 1: 20\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nFor how many ordered triplets (a,b,c) of positive integers less than 10 is the product a*b*c divisible by 20?\\n\\nPositive integers less than 10: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 → 9 choices each.\\nTotal triplets: 9^3 = 729\\n\\nWe want abc divisible by 20 = 4 * 5 = 2^2 * 5\\nSo need at least two factors of 2 and at least one factor of 5 in the product.\\n\\nWe can use complementary counting or inclusion.\\nBetter: count total minus those not divisible by 4 or not divisible by 5.\\nBut need divisible by both 4 and 5? No: divisible by 20 means divisible by 4 and by 5, since 4 and 5 coprime.\\nYes, because 20 = 4*5 and gcd(4,5)=1.\\nSo abc divisible by 20 iff divisible by 4 and by 5.\\n\\nSo let A: abc divisible by 4\\nB: abc divisible by 5\\nWe want |A ∩ B| = total - |A^c ∪ B^c| = total - |A^c| - |B^c| + |A^c ∩ B^c|\\n\\nSo compute:\\nTotal = 9^3 = 729\\n|A^c| = number of triplets where abc not divisible by 4\\n|B^c| = abc not divisible by 5\\n|A^c ∩ B^c| = abc not divisible by 4 and not divisible by 5\\n\\nFirst, |B^c|: abc not divisible by 5\\nThis means that none of a,b,c is divisible by 5? No: if at least one is divisible by 5, then product is. So not divisible by 5 iff no a,b,c divisible by 5.\\nNumbers divisible by 5 in 1-9: 5 → only one\\nSo numbers not divisible by 5: 8 (1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9)\\nSo |B^c| = 8^3 = 512\\n\\nNow |A^c|: abc not divisible by 4\\nThis is trickier, because divisibility by 4 depends on the total power of 2.\\nA number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4, but here we care about the product.\\n\\nWe need the exponent of 2 in abc to be less than 2, i.e., 0 or 1.\\n\\nSo we need to classify each number from 1 to 9 by its 2-adic valuation.\\n\\nList:\\n1: v2=0\\n2: v2=1\\n3: v2=0\\n4: v2=2 (since 4=2^2)\\n5: v2=0\\n6: v2=1 (6=2*3)\\n7: v2=0\\n8: v2=3 (8=2^3)\\n9: v2=0\\n\\nSo:\\nv2=0: 1,3,5,7,9 → 5 numbers\\nv2=1: 2,6 → 2 numbers\\nv2≥2: 4,8 → 2 numbers (4 has v2=2, 8 has v2=3)\\n\\nNow, abc has v2 < 2 iff the sum of v2(a) + v2(b) + v2(c) < 2, i.e., 0 or 1.\\n\\nCase 1: sum v2 = 0: all three have v2=0\\nNumber: 5^3 = 125\\n\\nCase 2: sum v2 = 1: exactly one of a,b,c has v2=1, and the other two have v2=0\\nChoose which one has v2=1: 3 choices\\nThat variable: 2 choices (2 or 6)\\nOther two: each 5 choices (from v2=0 group)\\nSo 3 * 2 * 5 * 5 = 3*2*25=150\\n\\nTotal |A^c| = 125 + 150 = 275\\n\\nNow |A^c ∩ B^c|: abc not div by 4 and not div by 5\\nSo not div by 5: none of a,b,c is 5\\nAnd sum v2 < 2\\n\\nBut now, the numbers available are restricted: cannot use 5.\\nSo remove 5 from consideration.\\n\\nNumbers: 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 → 8 numbers\\nNow classify by v2 and whether divisible by 5 (but 5 is excluded, so none are divisible by 5 in this set)\\n\\nv2=0: 1,3,7,9 → 4 numbers (since 5 removed)\\nv2=1: 2,6 → still 2\\nv2≥2: 4,8 → 2\\n\\nNow, sum v2 < 2: sum =0 or 1\\n\\nSum=0: all three v2=0 → 4^3 = 64\\n\\nSum=1: exactly one has v2=1, others v2=0\\nChoose which one: 3 choices\\nThat one: 2 choices (2 or 6)\\nOthers: each 4 choices → 3 * 2 * 4 * 4 = 3*2*16=96\\n\\nTotal |A^c ∩ B^c| = 64 + 96 = 160\\n\\nNow, back to inclusion:\\n|A ∩ B| = total - |A^c| - |B^c| + |A^c ∩ B^c| = 729 - 275 - 512 + 160\\nCompute: 729 - 275 = 454; 454 - 512 = -58; -58 + 160 = 102\\n\\nSo 102\\n\\nBut let me verify with direct count or sanity check.\\n\\nAlternative approach: ensure at least one 5, and sufficient powers of 2.\\n\\nSince must have at least one multiple of 5, and only 5 itself, so at least one of a,b,c is 5.\\n\\nCase 1: exactly one is 5\\nChoose which one: 3 choices (say a=5)\\nThen b and c from {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9}, but the product bc must provide at least two factors of 2, because a=5 contributes no factor of 2.\\nSo bc must be divisible by 4.\\n\\nb and c in {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9}\\nWe need v2(b) + v2(c) ≥ 2\\n\\nPossible pairs (b,c):\\nTotal possible: 8*8=64\\nSubtract those with v2(b)+v2(c) < 2, i.e., 0 or 1\\n\\nFrom earlier, without 5, v2=0:4, v2=1:2, v2≥2:2\\n\\nSum v2 < 2:\\n- both v2=0: 4*4=16\\n- one v2=1, other v2=0: 2 choices for who has v2=1, then 2 choices for that (2 or 6), 4 for the other → 2 * 2 * 4 = 16? No: for fixed b and c, number of pairs:\\n- b v2=0, c v2=0: 4*4=16\\n- b v2=1, c v2=0: 2*4=8\\n- b v2=0, c v2=1: 4*2=8\\nTotal: 16+8+8=32\\n\\nSo number with sum v2 < 2: 32\\nThus sum v2 ≥ 2: 64 - 32 = 32\\n\\nSo for each choice of position for 5, and the other two, 32 possibilities\\nSo case 1: 3 * 32 = 96\\n\\nCase 2: exactly two are 5\\nChoose which two: C(3,2)=3 ways\\nSay a=5, b=5, c ≠5\\nc in {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9}\\nNow product abc = 25 * c\\nNeed divisible by 20 → 25c / 20 = 5c/4, so need 4 divides 5c, but gcd(5,4)=1, so 4|c\\nSo c must be divisible by 4\\nIn {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9}, divisible by 4: 4,8 → 2 choices\\nSo for each such, 2 choices for c\\nThus case 2: 3 * 2 = 6\\n\\nCase 3: all three are 5\\na=b=c=5\\nProduct=125\\n125 div by 20? 125/20=6.25, not integer. 125 mod 20 = 5, not 0. So no.\\nBecause 125 = 5^3, no factor of 2, so not divisible by 4, hence not by 20.\\nSo 0\\n\\nTotal: 96 + 6 + 0 = 102\\n\\nMatches previous calculation.\\n\\nSo answer is 102.\\n\\nBut let me confirm with an example.\\nFor instance, (5,4,1): product=20, yes\\n(5,2,2): 20, yes\\n(5,2,1): 10, not div by 4? 10 not div by 4, so no — and in our count, for (5,2,1), v2(b)+v2(c)=v2(2)+v2(1)=1+0=1<2, so not included, correct.\\n(4,5,1): same\\n(5,5,4): 100, div by 20? 100/20=5, yes\\n(5,5,2): 50, 50/20=2.5, not integer, and 2 not div by 4, so correctly excluded.\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nSo answers:\\nProblem 1: 20\\nProblem 2: 102\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"20\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"102\"\n}",
