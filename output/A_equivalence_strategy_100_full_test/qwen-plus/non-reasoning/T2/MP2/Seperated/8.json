On Saturday, he starts at $ z $ and visits points $ z^3, z^5, z^7, \\\\ldots, z^{2013} $ in order. On Sunday, he starts at 1 and visits $ z^2, z^4, z^6, \\\\ldots, z^{2012} $.\\n\\nThe total distance from the starting point to the last house is $ \\\\sqrt{2012} $ on both days. Note: The problem says \\\"the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house\\\", which suggests it's just the straight-line distance from start to end, not the total path length over all segments. But then it says \\\"Eli always walks directly between two houses\\\", implying a polygonal path. However, the phrase \\\"the distance ... from his starting point to the last house\\\" clearly refers to the straight-line Euclidean distance from start to final destination, not the sum of all steps.\\n\\nSo we interpret: \\n- On Saturday: distance from $ z $ to $ z^{2013} $ is $ \\\\sqrt{2012} $\\n- On Sunday: distance from $ 1 $ to $ z^{2012} $ is $ \\\\sqrt{2012} $\\n\\nSo:\\n$$\\n|z^{2013} - z| = \\\\sqrt{2012}\\n$$\\n$$\\n|z^{2012} - 1| = \\\\sqrt{2012}\\n$$\\n\\nLet $ w = z $. We work with modulus.\\n\\nLet’s denote $ r = |z| $, and suppose $ z = r e^{i\\\\theta} $. Then:\\n\\nFirst equation:\\n$$\\n|z^{2013} - z| = |z| \\\\cdot |z^{2012} - 1| = r \\\\cdot |z^{2012} - 1|\\n$$\\nBut from second equation, $ |z^{2012} - 1| = \\\\sqrt{2012} $, so:\\n$$\\n|z^{2013} - z| = r \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{2012}\\n$$\\nBut this equals $ \\\\sqrt{2012} $, so:\\n$$\\nr \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{2012} = \\\\sqrt{2012} \\\\Rightarrow r = 1\\n$$\\nThus $ |z| = 1 $, so $ k = |z| - 1 = 0 $\\n\\nWait — but let’s double-check.\\n\\nIf $ |z| = 1 $, then $ z $ lies on the unit circle, so $ z = e^{i\\\\theta} $\\nThen $ z^n = e^{in\\\\theta} $, and $ |z^n - 1|^2 = (\\\\cos n\\\\theta - 1)^2 + \\\\sin^2 n\\\\theta = 2 - 2\\\\cos n\\\\theta = 4 \\\\sin^2(n\\\\theta/2) $\\nSo $ |z^{2012} - 1| = 2 |\\\\sin(1006\\\\theta)| = \\\\sqrt{2012} $\\nSimilarly, $ |z^{2013} - z| = |z| \\\\cdot |z^{2012} - 1| = |z^{2012} - 1| $ since $ |z| = 1 $, so both distances are equal automatically.\\n\\nSo we only need:\\n$$\\n|z^{2012} - 1| = \\\\sqrt{2012}\\n$$\\nSquare both sides:\\n$$\\n|z^{2012} - 1|^2 = 2012\\n$$\\nBut $ |w - 1|^2 = 2 - 2\\\\Re(w) $ when $ |w| = 1 $. Since $ |z| = 1 \\\\Rightarrow |z^{2012}| = 1 $, so:\\n$$\\n|z^{2012} - 1|^2 = 2 - 2\\\\Re(z^{2012}) = 2012\\n\\\\Rightarrow -2\\\\Re(z^{2012}) = 2010 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\Re(z^{2012}) = -1005\\n$$\\nBut real part of a complex number on the unit circle must be in $ [-1,1] $, and $ -1005 $ is impossible.\\n\\nContradiction! So our assumption must be wrong.\\n\\nAh — wait! We assumed $ |z^{2013} - z| = |z| \\\\cdot |z^{2012} - 1| $. Is that true?\\n\\nYes: $ |z^{2013} - z| = |z(z^{2012} - 1)| = |z| \\\\cdot |z^{2012} - 1| $\\nAnd we are told this equals $ \\\\sqrt{2012} $\\nAlso $ |z^{2012} - 1| = \\\\sqrt{2012} $\\nSo:\\n$$\\n|z| \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{2012} = \\\\sqrt{2012} \\\\Rightarrow |z| = 1\\n$$\\nBut then $ |z^{2012} - 1| \\\\leq |z^{2012}| + 1 = 2 $, but $ \\\\sqrt{2012} \\\\approx 44.85 > 2 $, impossible.\\n\\nSo contradiction again.\\n\\nTherefore, our interpretation must be wrong.\\n\\nWait — perhaps \\\"the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house\\\" means the total path length, i.e., the sum of distances between consecutive houses, not just start to end.\\n\\nThat makes more sense, because otherwise the values are too large.\\n\\nLet’s re-interpret:\\n\\nOn Saturday: starts at $ z $, goes to $ z^3 $, then $ z^5 $, ..., up to $ z^{2013} $\\nSequence of points: $ z, z^3, z^5, \\\\ldots, z^{2013} $\\nThis is an arithmetic sequence in exponents: odd powers from 1 to 2013, but starting at exponent 1? Wait: starts at $ z $, which is $ z^1 $, then $ z^3 $, etc.\\nExponents: 1, 3, 5, ..., 2013\\nNumber of terms: $ (2013 - 1)/2 + 1 = 1007 $ terms\\nNumber of segments: 1006\\nTotal distance: $ \\\\sum_{k=1}^{1006} |z^{2k+1} - z^{2k-1}| = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{1006} |z^{2k-1}(z^2 - 1)| = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{1006} |z|^{2k-1} |z^2 - 1| $\\nSince $ |z^{2k-1}(z^2 - 1)| = |z|^{2k-1} \\\\cdot |z^2 - 1| $\\nSo total Saturday distance:\\n$$\\nD_{\\\\text{Sat}} = |z^2 - 1| \\\\sum_{k=1}^{1006} r^{2k-1}, \\\\quad r = |z|\\n$$\\nSimilarly, Sunday: starts at 1, goes to $ z^2, z^4, \\\\ldots, z^{2012} $\\nPoints: $ 1 = z^0 $? No, starts at 1, then $ z^2, z^4, \\\\ldots, z^{2012} $\\nSo exponents: 0 (if 1 = z^0), but only if z ≠ 0. But 1 may not be a power unless |z|=1 or something. Actually, the starting point is 1, not necessarily $ z^0 $.\\nBut the path is: from 1 to $ z^2 $, then to $ z^4 $, ..., to $ z^{2012} $\\nSo the points are: $ P_0 = 1, P_1 = z^2, P_2 = z^4, \\\\ldots, P_{1006} = z^{2012} $? Wait: $ z^2, z^4, \\\\ldots, z^{2012} $ — number of deliveries after start: first delivery at $ z^2 $, last at $ z^{2012} $\\nExponents: 2,4,6,...,2012 → number of terms: (2012-2)/2 + 1 = 1006 terms\\nBut he starts at 1, then goes to these 1006 points in order.\\nSo total segments: from 1 to $ z^2 $, $ z^2 $ to $ z^4 $, ..., $ z^{2010} $ to $ z^{2012} $ → number of segments: 1006\\nSunday distance:\\n$$\\nD_{\\\\text{Sun}} = |z^2 - 1| + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{1005} |z^{2k+2} - z^{2k}| = |z^2 - 1| + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{1005} |z^{2k}(z^2 - 1)| = |z^2 - 1| + |z^2 - 1| \\\\sum_{k=1}^{1005} r^{2k}\\n$$\\nSo:\\n$$\\nD_{\\\\text{Sun}} = |z^2 - 1| \\\\left( 1 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{1005} r^{2k} \\\\right) = |z^2 - 1| \\\\left( \\\\sum_{k=0}^{1005} r^{2k} \\\\right)\\n$$\\nNow Saturday:\\nSegments: from $ z $ to $ z^3 $, $ z^3 $ to $ z^5 $, ..., $ z^{2011} $ to $ z^{2013} $\\nExponents: 1 to 3, 3 to 5, ..., 2011 to 2013 → differences of 2\\nEach segment: $ |z^{2k+1} - z^{2k-1}| = |z^{2k-1}(z^2 - 1)| = r^{2k-1} |z^2 - 1| $\\nFor k from 1 to 1006: when k=1: z^1 to z^3; k=1006: z^{2011} to z^{2013}? Wait: 2*1006 -1 = 2011, yes.\\nSo 1006 segments.\\nThus:\\n$$\\nD_{\\\\text{Sat}} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{1006} r^{2k-1} |z^2 - 1| = |z^2 - 1| \\\\sum_{m=1}^{1006} r^{2m-1}\\n$$\\nwhere m = k.\\nWe are told that the total distance traveled from start to last house is $ \\\\sqrt{2012} $ on both days. So:\\n$$\\nD_{\\\\text{Sat}} = \\\\sqrt{2012}, \\\\quad D_{\\\\text{Sun}} = \\\\sqrt{2012}\\n$$\\nSo:\\n$$\\n|z^2 - 1| \\\\sum_{k=1}^{1006} r^{2k-1} = \\\\sqrt{2012}\\n$$\\n$$\\n|z^2 - 1| \\\\sum_{k=0}^{1005} r^{2k} = \\\\sqrt{2012}\\n$$\\nSince both equal $ \\\\sqrt{2012} $, set them equal:\\n$$\\n|z^2 - 1| \\\\sum_{k=1}^{1006} r^{2k-1} = |z^2 - 1| \\\\sum_{k=0}^{1005} r^{2k}\\n$$\\nAssuming $ |z^2 - 1| \\\\neq 0 $ (otherwise distance is zero, not $ \\\\sqrt{2012} $), we can divide both sides:\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{1006} r^{2k-1} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{1005} r^{2k}\\n$$\\nLeft side: sum of $ r^{1}, r^{3}, r^{5}, \\\\ldots, r^{2011} $ — 1006 terms, odd powers from 1 to 2011\\nRight side: $ r^0, r^2, r^4, \\\\ldots, r^{2010} $ — 1006 terms (k=0 to 1005), even powers from 0 to 2010\\nSo:\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{j=1}^{1006} r^{2j-1} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{1005} r^{2j}\\n$$\\nLet $ x = r^2 $. Then left side: $ r \\\\sum_{j=1}^{1006} (r^2)^{j-1} = r \\\\sum_{m=0}^{1005} x^m = r \\\\cdot \\\\frac{x^{1006} - 1}{x - 1} $ for $ x \\\\neq 1 $\\nActually:\\nSum of geometric series:\\nLeft: $ r + r^3 + \\\\cdots + r^{2011} = r(1 + r^2 + r^4 + \\\\cdots + r^{2010}) = r \\\\sum_{k=0}^{1005} (r^2)^k = r \\\\cdot \\\\frac{(r^2)^{1006} - 1}{r^2 - 1} = r \\\\cdot \\\\frac{r^{2012} - 1}{r^2 - 1} $\\nRight: $ 1 + r^2 + r^4 + \\\\cdots + r^{2010} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{1005} r^{2k} = \\\\frac{r^{2012} - 1}{r^2 - 1} $\\nSo equation:\\n$$\\nr \\\\cdot \\\\frac{r^{2012} - 1}{r^2 - 1} = \\\\frac{r^{2012} - 1}{r^2 - 1}\\n$$\\nAssuming $ r^{2012} \\\\neq 1 $ and $ r^2 \\\\neq 1 $, we can divide both sides by $ \\\\frac{r^{2012} - 1}{r^2 - 1} $ (which is nonzero if $ r \\\\neq 1 $ and $ r^{2012} \\\\neq 1 $), getting:\\n$$\\nr = 1\\n$$\\nBut if r = 1, then left side sum: sum of 1006 ones = 1006\\nRight side: sum of 1006 ones = 1006, so equal.\\nBut also if $ r^{2012} = 1 $, then both sums are zero? No: if $ r^{2012} = 1 $, but r > 0, then r = 1 since r real non-negative.\\nIf r = 1, then both sums are 1006.\\nBut what if $ r^2 = 1 $? Then r = 1 (since r ≥ 0).\\nSo only solution is r = 1.\\nBut earlier we saw that if r = 1, then $ |z^2 - 1| $ is bounded, but let's compute the distance.\\nIf r = 1, then $ D_{\\\\text{Sat}} = |z^2 - 1| \\\\times 1006 $\\n$ D_{\\\\text{Sun}} = |z^2 - 1| \\\\times 1006 $\\nSo both equal, good.\\nSet equal to $ \\\\sqrt{2012} $:\\n$$\\n1006 |z^2 - 1| = \\\\sqrt{2012}\\n\\\\Rightarrow |z^2 - 1| = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2012}}{1006} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{4 \\\\cdot 503}}{1006} = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{503}}{1006} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{503}}{503}\\n$$\\nBut the problem says: \\\"find the real part of $ z^2 $\\\" — but then says \\\"instead, find $ k = |z| - 1 $\\\"\\nAnd we have $ |z| = r = 1 $, so $ k = 1 - 1 = 0 $\\nBut is this consistent?\\nWe have $ |z| = 1 $, so $ z = e^{i\\\\theta} $, $ z^2 = e^{i2\\\\theta} $, $ |z^2 - 1| = 2 |\\\\sin \\\\theta| $\\nSet equal to $ \\\\sqrt{503}/503 $? Earlier we have $ |z^2 - 1| = \\\\sqrt{2012}/1006 = \\\\sqrt{4\\\\cdot503}/1006 = 2\\\\sqrt{503}/1006 = \\\\sqrt{503}/503 $\\nBut $ |z^2 - 1| = 2 |\\\\sin \\\\theta| \\\\leq 2 $, and $ \\\\sqrt{503} \\\\approx 22.4 $, so $ \\\\sqrt{503}/503 \\\\approx 22.4 / 503 \\\\approx 0.0445 < 2 $, so possible.\\nBut the key point is that $ |z| = 1 $, so $ k = 0 $\\nThe problem says: \\\"find $ k = |z| - 1 $\\\", so answer is 0.\\nBut let me confirm if there are other solutions.\\nEarlier, when we had:\\n$$\\nr \\\\cdot \\\\frac{r^{2012} - 1}{r^2 - 1} = \\\\frac{r^{2012} - 1}{r^2 - 1}\\n$$\\nIf $ r^{2012} = 1 $, then both sides are 0 only if numerator is zero, but denominator may be issue.\\nIf $ r^{2012} = 1 $ and r > 0 real, then r = 1.\\nIf $ r^2 = 1 $, r = 1.\\nOtherwise, we divided to get r = 1.\\nSo only solution is r = 1.\\nThus $ k = 0 $\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"the distance ... is $ \\\\sqrt{2012} $ on both days\\\", and with r=1, D = 1006 |z^2 - 1| = \\\\sqrt{2012} \\nSo |z^2 - 1| = \\\\sqrt{2012}/1006 \\nWhich is fine, as above.\\nSo k = |z| - 1 = 0\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nBob's Rice ID number has six digits, each from 1 to 9 (no 0), and satisfies:\\n- First 2 digits form a number divisible by 2\\n- First 3 digits form a number divisible by 3\\n- First 4 digits form a number divisible by 4\\n- First 5 digits form a number divisible by 5\\n- Full 6-digit number divisible by 6\\n\\nNote: divisible by 6 means divisible by 2 and 3.\\n\\nWe build the number digit by digit: d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6\\nEach di ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}\\n\\nConditions:\\n1. d1d2 divisible by 2 ⇒ d2 even. Since digits 1-9, d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\n2. d1d2d3 divisible by 3 ⇒ d1+d2+d3 ≡ 0 mod 3\\n3. d1d2d3d4 divisible by 4 ⇒ last two digits d3d4 must form number divisible by 4. Because a number is divisible by 4 iff its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\\n4. d1d2d3d4d5 divisible by 5 ⇒ d5 must be 5 (since no 0, and divisible by 5, so d5=5; cannot be 0)\\n5. Entire number divisible by 6 ⇒ must be divisible by 2 and 3.\\n   - Divisible by 2: d6 even ⇒ d6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\n   - Divisible by 3: d1+d2+d3+d4+d5+d6 ≡ 0 mod 3\\n\\nBut note: condition 2 already requires d1+d2+d3 ≡ 0 mod 3\\nCondition 5 requires sum of all six digits ≡ 0 mod 3\\nSince d5=5, and d1+d2+d3 ≡ 0 mod 3, then:\\n(d1+d2+d3) + d4 + d5 + d6 ≡ 0 + d4 + 5 + d6 ≡ d4 + d6 + 5 ≡ 0 mod 3\\nSo d4 + d6 ≡ -5 ≡ 1 mod 3 (since -5 mod 3 = 1, as -5 + 6 =1)\\nSo d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3\\n\\nAlso, from condition 3: d3d4 must be divisible by 4, i.e., 10*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 4\\nBut since 100 is divisible by 4, only last two digits matter, yes.\\n10*d3 + d4 ≡ 2*d3 + d4 mod 4? 10≡2 mod 4, so yes: 10*d3 + d4 ≡ 2*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 4\\n\\nSo constraints:\\n- d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\n- d5 = 5\\n- d6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\n- d1,d3,d4 ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}\\n- d1+d2+d3 ≡ 0 mod 3\\n- 2*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 4\\n- d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3\\n\\nWe can iterate through possibilities.\\nSince d5 is fixed, and others have constraints, we can count the number of valid combinations.\\n\\nApproach: loop through d1,d2,d3,d4,d6, check conditions, d5=5 fixed.\\nBut better to fix variables with fewer choices.\\n\\nd2: 4 choices (2,4,6,8)\\nd6: 4 choices (2,4,6,8)\\nd5: 1 choice (5)\\nd1,d3,d4: 9 choices each, but with constraints.\\n\\nBut many constraints involve sums mod 3 and the divisibility by 4.\\n\\nWe can fix d3 and d4 first, since they interact via the mod 4 condition, and d4 interacts with d6 via mod 3.\\n\\nList possible (d3,d4) pairs such that 2*d3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 4\\nd3 from 1 to 9, d4 from 1 to 9\\n\\nMake a table.\\nFor each d3, compute 2*d3 mod 4, then d4 must satisfy d4 ≡ -2*d3 mod 4\\n\\n2*d3 mod 4:\\n- If d3 even: d3=2,4,6,8 → 2*d3 = 4,8,12,16 ≡ 0 mod 4\\n  So d4 ≡ 0 mod 4 ⇒ d4 ∈ {4,8} (since 1-9, multiples of 4: 4,8; 12>9)\\n  d4=4 or 8\\n- If d3 odd: d3=1,3,5,7,9 → 2*d3=2,6,10,14,18 ≡ 2 mod 4\\n  So d4 ≡ -2 ≡ 2 mod 4 ⇒ d4 ≡ 2 mod 4 ⇒ d4 ∈ {2,6} (since 2,6; 10>9; 1,3,5,7,9 are odd, 4,8≡0, so only 2,6)\\n\\nSo:\\n- If d3 odd, d4 ∈ {2,6}\\n- If d3 even, d4 ∈ {4,8}\\n\\nNow, for each such pair, we have constraints involving d1,d2,d6 via mod 3 conditions.\\n\\nAlso, d1+d2+d3 ≡ 0 mod 3\\nAnd d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3\\n\\nd6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}, and d4 is either in {2,6} or {4,8}, depending on d3.\\n\\nWe can group by d3 parity.\\n\\nCase 1: d3 odd\\nThen d4 ∈ {2,6}\\nSubcases based on d4\\n\\nBut better to fix d3 and d4, then see required d2 and d6, then d1.\\n\\nSince d1 only appears in d1+d2+d3 ≡0 mod 3, once d2 and d3 are fixed, d1 must be ≡ -d2-d3 mod 3, and d1∈1-9, so 3 choices for each residue class (since 9 digits, equally distributed mod 3: residues 0,1,2 each have 3 digits: res 0: 3,6,9; res 1:1,4,7; res 2:2,5,8)\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nSo plan:\\nLoop over d3 (1-9)\\nLoop over d4 allowed by d3 (as above)\\nLoop over d6 (2,4,6,8)\\nCheck if d4 + d6 ≡1 mod 3\\nLoop over d2 (2,4,6,8)\\nThen d1 must satisfy d1 ≡ -d2 -d3 mod 3, and d1∈1-9, so 3 choices\\nThen d5=5 fixed\\nCount\\n\\nBut d2 and d6 are independent except through d4 and the sum.\\n\\nSince for each combination of d3,d4,d2,d6 satisfying the modular conditions, d1 has 3 choices, and d5 fixed.\\n\\nSo total count = sum over valid (d3,d4,d2,d6) with:\\n- d3,d4 compatible (via parity rule above)\\n- d4 + d6 ≡1 mod 3\\n- d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\n- and for each such, d1 has 3 choices (since residue determined)\\n\\nd1 has exactly 3 choices for each required residue mod 3, as the digits 1-9 have three in each residue class.\\n\\nSo we don't need to loop d1, just multiply by 3 for each valid (d3,d4,d2,d6)\\n\\nNow, d3: 9 choices (1-9)\\nBut d4 depends on d3.\\n\\nWe can compute the number of valid (d3,d4,d2,d6) quadruples satisfying:\\n1. If d3 odd, d4 ∈ {2,6}; if d3 even, d4 ∈ {4,8}\\n2. d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3\\n3. d2 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\n4. d6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\n\\nAnd for each such, add 3 (for d1 choices)\\n\\nSince d2 has no other constraint (yet), and d6 only constrained by the mod 3 with d4, and d2 is free in {2,4,6,8}, so 4 choices for d2 regardless.\\n\\nSo for each valid (d3,d4,d6) triple satisfying 1 and 2, there are 4 choices for d2, and then 3 for d1, so 12 per valid triple.\\n\\nThus total count = 12 × (number of valid (d3,d4,d6) triples)\\n\\nNow, count number of (d3,d4,d6) with:\\n- d3 ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}\\n- d4 as per d3 parity\\n- d6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\n- d4 + d6 ≡ 1 mod 3\\n\\nSplit by d3 parity.\\n\\nCase A: d3 odd\\nd3 ∈ {1,3,5,7,9} → 5 choices\\nThen d4 ∈ {2,6} → 2 choices\\nNow d6 ∈ {2,4,6,8}\\nCheck d4 + d6 ≡1 mod 3\\n\\nFirst, find residues mod 3:\\nd4: if d4=2, res 2; d4=6, res 0 (since 6÷3=2)\\nd6: 2→2, 4→1, 6→0, 8→2 (8-6=2)\\n\\nSo:\\nSubcase A1: d4=2 (res 2)\\nThen d4 + d6 ≡ 2 + d6_res ≡1 mod 3 ⇒ d6_res ≡ -1 ≡2 mod 3\\nd6 with res 2: d6=2 (res2), d6=8 (res2) → d6=2 or 8 → 2 choices\\n\\nSubcase A2: d4=6 (res 0)\\nThen d4 + d6 ≡ 0 + d6_res ≡1 mod 3 ⇒ d6_res ≡1 mod 3\\nd6 with res 1: d6=4 (res1) → only one? d6=4 → res1; d6=2→2, 6→0, 8→2, so only d6=4 → 1 choice\\n\\nSo for each odd d3:\\n- If choose d4=2, then 2 choices for d6\\n- If choose d4=6, then 1 choice for d6\\n\\nSo per odd d3: number of (d4,d6) pairs: for d4=2: 2 d6's; for d4=6: 1 d6 → total 2 + 1 = 3 pairs\\n\\nSince d4 choice is independent, total for one d3: when d4=2 (one option), d6=2 or 8 (two options); when d4=6 (one option), d6=4 (one option). So total (d4,d6) combinations: (2,2),(2,8),(6,4) → 3 combinations\\n\\nYes.\\nSo for each odd d3, 3 valid (d4,d6) pairs\\n5 odd d3 → 5 × 3 = 15\\n\\nCase B: d3 even\\nd3 ∈ {2,4,6,8} → 4 choices (note: d3=2,4,6,8; d3=1-9 even: 2,4,6,8 → yes 4)\\nThen d4 ∈ {4,8} → 2 choices\\n\\nResidues:\\nd4=4 → res 1 (4-3=1)\\nd4=8 → res 2 (8-6=2)\\nd6 same as before: 2→2,4→1,6→0,8→2\\n\\nSubcase B1: d4=4 (res1)\\nThen d4 + d6 ≡1 + d6_res ≡1 mod 3 ⇒ d6_res ≡0 mod 3\\nd6 with res 0: d6=6 → only one (since 6÷3=2 rem 0) → d6=6 → 1 choice\\n\\nSubcase B2: d4=8 (res2)\\nThen d4 + d6 ≡2 + d6_res ≡1 mod 3 ⇒ d6_res ≡ -1 ≡2 mod 3\\nd6 with res 2: d6=2,8 → 2 choices\\n\\nSo per even d3: \\n- d4=4: 1 d6 choice (d6=6)\\n- d4=8: 2 d6 choices (d6=2,8)\\nTotal (d4,d6) pairs: (4,6), (8,2), (8,8) → 3 pairs\\nSame as before.\\n\\nSo for each even d3, 3 valid (d4,d6) pairs\\n4 even d3 → 4 × 3 = 12\\n\\nTotal (d3,d4,d6) triples: 15 (from odd d3) + 12 (from even d3) = 27\\n\\nThen for each such triple, d2 has 4 choices (2,4,6,8), and d1 has 3 choices (based on d2,d3 mod 3 requirement)\\nSo total numbers: 27 × 4 × 3 = 27 × 12 = 324\\n\\nBut is that all? d5=5 fixed.\\n\\nLet me verify with the example: 123252\\nCheck:\\nd1=1,d2=2,d3=3,d4=2,d5=5,d6=2\\n- First 2: 12 ÷2=6, yes\\n- First 3: 123 ÷3=41, yes\\n- First 4: 1232 ÷4? 32÷4=8, yes\\n- First 5: 12325 ÷5? ends with 5, yes\\n- Full: 123252 ÷2? even, yes; ÷3: sum=1+2+3+2+5+2=15÷3=5, yes\\nGood.\\n\\nIn our count: d3=3 odd, so d4 should be 2 or 6; here d4=2, ok\\nd6=2\\nd4 + d6 =2+2=4≡1 mod 3? 4-3=1, yes\\nd2=2, even, ok\\nd1 must satisfy d1+d2+d3=d1+2+3=d1+5≡0 mod 3 ⇒ d1≡1 mod 3 (since 5≡2, so d1≡-2≡1 mod 3)\\nd1=1, which is res1, yes\\nSo included.\\n\\nNow, is there any overcount or missing constraint?\\nWe have the sum for divisibility by 3 for first 3 digits, and for full 6 digits we used the additional constraint d4+d6+5≡0 mod 3, which came from the total sum ≡0 mod 3 and first three sum ≡0 mod 3.\\nBut the full divisibility by 6 requires the whole number divisible by 3, which we ensured by d4+d6≡1 mod 3 (since d5=5≡2, and d1+d2+d3≡0, so total sum ≡ 0 + d4 + 2 + d6 ≡ d4+d6+2 ≡0 mod 3, so d4+d6≡1 mod 3, yes)\\nAnd divisible by 2 via d6 even.\\nAll conditions covered.\\n\\nSo total 324.\\n\\nBut let me confirm the count.\\nTotal (d3,d4,d6) triples: 27\\nFor each, d2: 4 choices\\nFor each such, d1: 3 choices (since for fixed d2,d3, the required residue for d1 is fixed, and 3 digits satisfy it)\\nSo 27 * 4 * 3 = 324\\n\\nWe could compute total without grouping.\\nBut seems consistent.\\n\\nAnother way: total possible without constraints, but this is efficient.\\n\\nSo answer for Problem 2 is 324.\\n\\nBack to Problem 1: we concluded k=0\\nBut the problem says \\\"find the real part of z^2\\\" but then says \\\"instead, find k=|z|-1\\\"\\nAnd we found |z|=1, so k=0\\n\\nBut earlier I thought there was a contradiction, but that was under misinterpretation.\\nWith the path length interpretation, it works.\\nAnd we got r=1 as the only solution from equating the sums.\\nThen the distance condition determines |z^2 -1|, but doesn't affect |z|.\\nSo k=0.\\n\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"324\"\n}",
