But more precisely, $ f(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} $ iff $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q} $, but we already know that — the key is that $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $ must be a **rational number with denominator dividing the numerator in reduced form**, but better: since $ n^2 + 7 $ divides the numerator of the remainder.\\n\\nActually, from the identity:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7} = n - \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7}\\n$$\\nwe see that $ f(n) $ is integer iff $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $ is rational and the difference is integer — which happens iff $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $ is a rational number such that $ n - \\\\text{it} $ is integer → so $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} $ must be a rational number equal to $ n - f(n) $, which is rational.\\n\\nBut more importantly, since $ f(n) $ is rational, and $ n $ is integer, $ f(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} $ iff $ \\\\frac{7n - 3}{n^2 + 7} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q} $, but we need the fraction to be such that $ n^2 + 7 $ divides $ 7n - 3 $ in the sense that the entire expression is integer. But from the equation:\\n$$\\nf(n) = \\\\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\iff n^2 + 7 \\\\mid n^3 + 3\\n$$\\nSo we require:\\n$$\\nn^2 + 7 \\\\mid n^3 + 3\\n$$\\nNow use the division result:\\n$$\\nn^3 + 3 = (n^2 + 7)(n) - 7n + 3\\n$$\\nSo:\\n$$\\nn^3 + 3 = n(n^2 + 7) - 7n + 3\\n\\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{n^3 + 3}{n^2 + 7} = n + \\\\frac{-7n + 3}{n^2 + 7}\\n$$\\nSo for this to be integer, we need:\\n$$\\nn^2 + 7 \\\\mid -7n + 3 \\\\quad \\\\text{or equivalently} \\\\quad n^2 + 7 \\\\mid 7n - 3\\n$$\\nSince divisibility ignores sign.\\n\\nSo:\\n$$\\nn^2 + 7 \\\\mid 7n - 3\\n$$\\nNow, $ n^2 + 7 $ is generally much larger than $ 7n - 3 $ for large $ n $, so only small $ n $ can satisfy this unless $ 7n - 3 = 0 $, but $ n > 0 $, $ 7n - 3 = 0 \\\\Rightarrow n = 3/7 $, not integer.\\n\\nSo for $ n \\\\geq 1 $, $ n^2 + 7 > |7n - 3| $ eventually.\\n\\nLet’s find when $ n^2 + 7 > 7n - 3 $\\nSolve $ n^2 - 7n + 10 > 0 $\\n$ (n - 5)(n - 2) > 0 $ → true for $ n < 2 $ or $ n > 5 $\\nSo for $ n > 5 $, $ n^2 + 7 > 7n - 3 $, and since $ n^2 + 7 > 0 $, for $ n \\\\geq 6 $, $ n^2 + 7 > 7n - 3 \\\\geq 0 $ (for $ n \\\\geq 1 $, $ 7n - 3 \\\\geq 4 $), so $ n^2 + 7 > 7n - 3 > 0 $, so the only way $ n^2 + 7 \\\\mid 7n - 3 $ is if $ 7n - 3 = 0 $, impossible, or the divisor is ≤ the dividend in absolute value.\\n\\nSo possible only when $ n^2 + 7 \\\\leq 7n - 3 $\\nSolve:\\n$ n^2 - 7n + 10 \\\\leq 0 $\\n$ (n - 2)(n - 5) \\\\leq 0 \\\\Rightarrow n \\\\in [2, 5] $\\nSo possible $ n = 2, 3, 4, 5 $\\n\\nWe already tried:\\n- $ n = 2 $: $ f(2) = 1 $, integer ✓\\n- $ n = 3 $: $ 30/16 = 15/8 $ ✗\\n- $ n = 4 $: $ 67/23 \\\\approx 2.91 $ ✗\\n- $ n = 5 $: $ 128/32 = 4 $ ✓\\n\\nSo only $ n = 2 $ and $ n = 5 $\\n\\nNow compute $ k = n - f(n) $\\nFor $ n = 2 $: $ k = 2 - 1 = 1 $\\nFor $ n = 5 $: $ k = 5 - 4 = 1 $\\nSo in both cases, $ k = 1 $\\n\\nThe problem says: \\\"find $ k $, where $ k $ is the positive integer such that for each such positive integer, it equals the value of the expression plus $ k $\\\"\\n\\n\\\"it\\\" refers to $ n $, so:\\n$ n = f(n) + k \\\\Rightarrow k = n - f(n) $\\nAnd we found $ k = 1 $ in both valid cases.\\n\\nSo $ k = 1 $\\n\\nAnswer 1: 1\\n\\n---\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nFind all values of $ m $ for which the zeros of $ 2x^2 - m x - 8 $ differ by $ m - 1 $.\\n\\nLet the roots be $ r $ and $ s $, with $ r > s $, say.\\nGiven: $ |r - s| = m - 1 $\\nBut difference could be signed, but “differ by” usually means absolute difference, but let's see.\\nBut $ m - 1 $ could be negative, but difference of roots is non-negative, so probably $ m - 1 \\\\geq 0 $, so $ m \\\\geq 1 $\\nBut let's proceed algebraically.\\n\\nFor quadratic $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $, sum of roots = $ -b/a $, product = $ c/a $\\nHere: $ a = 2 $, $ b = -m $, $ c = -8 $\\nSo:\\nSum: $ r + s = \\\\frac{m}{2} $\\nProduct: $ r s = \\\\frac{-8}{2} = -4 $\\nDifference: $ |r - s| = m - 1 $\\nBut since it says \\\"differ by $ m - 1 $\\\", and difference is non-negative, we assume $ m - 1 \\\\geq 0 $, so $ m \\\\geq 1 $\\nAlso, $ (r - s)^2 = (r + s)^2 - 4rs $\\nSo:\\n$$\\n(r - s)^2 = \\\\left(\\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\right)^2 - 4(-4) = \\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16\\n$$\\nBut $ |r - s| = m - 1 $, so $ (r - s)^2 = (m - 1)^2 $\\nThus:\\n$$\\n(m - 1)^2 = \\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16\\n$$\\nExpand left:\\n$ m^2 - 2m + 1 = \\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16 $\\nMultiply both sides by 4:\\n$ 4m^2 - 8m + 4 = m^2 + 64 $\\nBring all to left:\\n$ 4m^2 - 8m + 4 - m^2 - 64 = 0 $\\n$ 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0 $\\nSolve quadratic:\\n$ m = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot (-60)}}{2 \\\\cdot 3} = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{64 + 720}}{6} = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{784}}{6} $\\n$ \\\\sqrt{784} = 28 $\\nSo:\\n$ m = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pm 28}{6} $\\nFirst: $ \\\\frac{8 + 28}{6} = \\\\frac{36}{6} = 6 $\\nSecond: $ \\\\frac{8 - 28}{6} = \\\\frac{-20}{6} = -\\\\frac{10}{3} $\\nNow check $ m - 1 \\\\geq 0 $? For $ m = 6 $: $ m - 1 = 5 > 0 $, ok\\nFor $ m = -10/3 $: $ m - 1 = -13/3 < 0 $, but difference of roots cannot be negative, so discard?\\nBut let's verify.\\n\\nCheck $ m = 6 $:\\nQuadratic: $ 2x^2 - 6x - 8 $\\nDivide by 2: $ x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 $\\nFactors: $ (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 $, roots: 4, -1\\nDifference: $ 4 - (-1) = 5 $, and $ m - 1 = 5 $, yes ✓\\n\\nNow $ m = -10/3 $:\\nQuadratic: $ 2x^2 - (-10/3)x - 8 = 2x^2 + \\\\frac{10}{3}x - 8 $\\nMultiply by 3: $ 6x^2 + 10x - 24 $\\nDiscriminant: $ 100 + 4*6*24 = 100 + 576 = 676 = 26^2 $\\nRoots: $ \\\\frac{ -10 \\\\pm 26 }{12} $\\nFirst: $ 16/12 = 4/3 $, second: $ -36/12 = -3 $\\nDifference: $ 4/3 - (-3) = 4/3 + 9/3 = 13/3 $\\nNow $ m - 1 = -10/3 - 1 = -13/3 $, absolute value is $ 13/3 $, so the actual difference is $ 13/3 $, but $ m - 1 = -13/3 $\\nIf \\\"differ by\\\" means the absolute difference, then we should have $ |r - s| = |m - 1| $? But the problem says \\\"differ by $ m - 1 $\\\", which typically means the value is $ m - 1 $, implying $ m - 1 \\\\geq 0 $\\nBut in this case, the difference is $ 13/3 $, and $ m - 1 = -13/3 $, so unless they mean the signed difference, but roots don't have order.\\nPerhaps they mean $ r - s = m - 1 $ for some ordering.\\nLet’s suppose the difference $ r - s = m - 1 $, without absolute value.\\nThen $ (r - s)^2 = (m - 1)^2 $ still holds, so same equation.\\nSo both solutions satisfy $ (r - s)^2 = (m - 1)^2 $, so the square of the difference equals the square of $ m - 1 $, so the absolute difference equals $ |m - 1| $\\nBut the problem says \\\"differ by $ m - 1 $\\\", which is ambiguous.\\nIn many contexts, \\\"differ by d\\\" means $ |r - s| = d $, requiring $ d \\\\geq 0 $\\nSo for $ m = -10/3 $, $ m - 1 = -13/3 < 0 $, so cannot be a difference (which is non-negative), so we discard.\\nThus only $ m = 6 $\\nBut wait — let's see if there's another interpretation.\\nSuppose the roots are $ \\\\alpha, \\\\beta $, and $ \\\\alpha - \\\\beta = m - 1 $\\nThen $ (\\\\alpha - \\\\beta)^2 = (m - 1)^2 $\\nSame as before.\\nSo we get same equation.\\nBut in that case, for $ m = -10/3 $, we can assign $ \\\\alpha = 4/3 $, $ \\\\beta = -3 $, then $ \\\\alpha - \\\\beta = 4/3 + 3 = 13/3 $, and $ m - 1 = -13/3 $, not equal.\\nIf we take $ \\\\beta - \\\\alpha = -3 - 4/3 = -13/3 = m - 1 $, then yes, $ \\\\beta - \\\\alpha = m - 1 $\\nSo if \\\"the zeros differ by $ m - 1 $\\\" means that one minus the other equals $ m - 1 $, then it's possible.\\nIn that case, both solutions work.\\nLet me check the problem: \\\"the zeros of ... differ by $ m - 1 $\\\"\\nThis is ambiguous. In mathematics, \\\"differ by\\\" often means absolute difference, but sometimes it allows signed.\\nBut in the context of roots, since they are unordered, likely absolute difference is intended.\\nHowever, to be safe, let's see if both are accepted.\\nFor $ m = -10/3 $, the difference between the roots is $ 13/3 $, and $ m - 1 = -13/3 $, so if we interpret \\\"differ by\\\" as the value of $ m - 1 $, it would require $ 13/3 = -13/3 $, false.\\nBut if we interpret as the magnitude, no.\\nThe phrase is: \\\"differ by $ m - 1 $\\\", meaning the amount of difference is $ m - 1 $. Since amounts are non-negative, $ m - 1 $ must be ≥ 0.\\nTherefore, $ m = -10/3 $ is invalid.\\nHence only $ m = 6 $\\nBut let's double-check the calculation.\\nWe had:\\n$ (r - s)^2 = (m - 1)^2 = \\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16 $\\nThen:\\n$ m^2 - 2m + 1 = \\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16 $\\nMultiply by 4:\\n$ 4m^2 - 8m + 4 = m^2 + 64 $\\n$ 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0 $\\nDiscriminant: $ 64 + 720 = 784 = 28^2 $, yes\\n$ m = [8 ± 28]/6 $, so 36/6=6, -20/6=-10/3\\nNow, for $ m = -10/3 $, $ m - 1 = -13/3 $, negative, while root difference is positive, so unless specified otherwise, we reject.\\nMoreover, in the context, $ m $ is likely expected to be real, but possibly fractional, but the difference condition fails due to sign.\\nSo only $ m = 6 $\\nBut wait — perhaps there are two values? Or did I miss something?\\nAlternatively, let the roots be $ a $ and $ b $, with $ a - b = m - 1 $\\nAnd $ a + b = m/2 $\\nThen adding: $ 2a = (m - 1) + m/2 = (3m/2 - 1) $ → $ a = 3m/4 - 1/2 $\\nSubtracting: $ 2b = m/2 - (m - 1) = -m/2 + 1 $ → $ b = -m/4 + 1/2 $\\nNow product: $ a b = -4 $\\nSo:\\n$ (3m/4 - 1/2)(-m/4 + 1/2) = -4 $\\nCompute:\\nLet me write:\\n$ \\\\left( \\\\frac{3m}{4} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right) \\\\left( -\\\\frac{m}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right) = -4 $\\nFactor:\\n= $ \\\\frac{1}{4}(3m - 2) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{4}(-m + 2) = \\\\frac{1}{16} (3m - 2)(-m + 2) $\\nSet equal to -4:\\n$ \\\\frac{1}{16} (3m - 2)(2 - m) = -4 $\\nNote: $ (-m + 2) = -(m - 2) $, but keep as is.\\n$ (3m - 2)(2 - m) = -64 $\\nExpand left:\\n$ 3m \\\\cdot 2 = 6m $\\n$ 3m \\\\cdot (-m) = -3m^2 $\\n$ -2 \\\\cdot 2 = -4 $\\n$ -2 \\\\cdot (-m) = 2m $\\nTotal: $ -3m^2 + 6m + 2m - 4 = -3m^2 + 8m - 4 $\\nSet equal to -64:\\n$ -3m^2 + 8m - 4 = -64 $\\n$ -3m^2 + 8m + 60 = 0 $\\nMultiply by -1: $ 3m^2 - 8m - 60 = 0 $, same as before.\\nSo same equation.\\nNow, when we set $ a - b = m - 1 $, we are assuming an order.\\nFor $ m = 6 $, we had roots 4 and -1, difference 5, $ m - 1 = 5 $, so if $ a = 4 $, $ b = -1 $, $ a - b = 5 = m - 1 $, good.\\nFor $ m = -10/3 $, roots are $ 4/3 $ and $ -3 $, difference $ 13/3 $\\n$ m - 1 = -13/3 $\\nSo if we set $ a - b = m - 1 = -13/3 $, then $ a $ is smaller root, $ b $ is larger? No: $ a - b = -13/3 $ implies $ a < b $\\nSet $ a = -3 $, $ b = 4/3 $, then $ a - b = -3 - 4/3 = -13/3 = m - 1 $, yes.\\nSo with appropriate labeling, $ a - b = m - 1 $ holds.\\nBut the problem says \\\"the zeros differ by $ m - 1 $\\\", which might mean the difference (as a quantity) is $ m - 1 $, which would require $ m - 1 \\\\geq 0 $, or it might allow the signed difference depending on order.\\nIn many algebraic contexts, especially when parameters are involved, both are accepted if the equation holds for some ordering.\\nMoreover, the problem asks for “all values of $ m $”, so likely both are valid.\\nLet me check if the product is correct.\\nFor $ m = -10/3 $, roots $ -3 $ and $ 4/3 $, product: $ -3 \\\\times 4/3 = -4 $, yes.\\nSum: $ -3 + 4/3 = -5/3 $, and $ m/2 = -10/6 = -5/3 $, yes.\\nAnd $ a - b = -3 - 4/3 = -13/3 $, $ m - 1 = -10/3 - 3/3 = -13/3 $, equal.\\nSo if we define the difference as first minus second, it works.\\nBut “differ by” is symmetric.\\nHowever, since the equation $ (r - s)^2 = (m - 1)^2 $ captures both cases, and both satisfy the mathematical condition that the difference between the roots equals $ m - 1 $ in value (with sign, depending on order), and since the problem likely intends all such $ m $, we should include both.\\nBut in the first case with $ m=6 $, difference is positive 5, $ m-1=5 $\\nIn second, difference is -13/3 if we subtract in one order, which equals $ m-1 $\\nBut “differ by” usually doesn’t specify order, so it's safer to assume absolute difference.\\nTo resolve, let's see if the problem might expect both.\\nPerhaps the answer is $ m = 6 $ and $ m = -10/3 $\\nBut let's see if there is another constraint.\\nAre there any restrictions on $ m $? It doesn't say integer, so fractional is allowed.\\nAnd both give real roots, since discriminant:\\nFor general $ m $, discriminant $ d = m^2 + 4*2*8 = m^2 + 64 > 0 $, always real.\\nSo both are valid mathematically.\\nBut the issue is interpretation of “differ by”.\\nUpon second thought, in most mathematical contexts, when we say “two numbers differ by d”, we mean $ |a - b| = d $, and $ d $ is non-negative.\\nFor example, “5 and 3 differ by 2”.\\nWe don't say “5 and 3 differ by -2”.\\nSo $ d $ must be non-negative.\\nTherefore, $ m - 1 $ must be $ \\\\geq 0 $, so $ m \\\\geq 1 $\\nThus $ m = -10/3 $ is invalid.\\nHence only $ m = 6 $\\nBut let's confirm with the earlier calculation.\\nFor $ m = -10/3 $, the roots differ by $ 13/3 $, not by $ -13/3 $. The amount of difference is $ 13/3 $, so they differ by $ 13/3 $, not by $ -13/3 $.\\nSo to satisfy “differ by $ m - 1 $”, we need $ m - 1 = 13/3 $, but $ m - 1 = -13/3 \\\\neq 13/3 $\\nUnless $ m - 1 = 13/3 $, but that would be different.\\nSo no, it does not satisfy.\\nTherefore, only when $ |r - s| = m - 1 $ and $ m - 1 \\\\geq 0 $\\nFrom earlier:\\n$ (r - s)^2 = (m - 1)^2 $, and $ m - 1 = |r - s| \\\\geq 0 $, so $ m - 1 = \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16 } $\\nBut from equation $ (m - 1)^2 = \\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 16 $, we solved, got two solutions, but only $ m = 6 $ has $ m - 1 = 5 > 0 $, and $ |r - s| = 5 $, so $ 5 = 5 $, good.\\nFor $ m = -10/3 $, $ m - 1 = -13/3 $, but $ |r - s| = 13/3 \\\\neq -13/3 $, so not equal.\\nThus only $ m = 6 $\\nSo answer is $ m = 6 $\\n\\nBut the problem says “all values”, plural, so maybe there is another?\\nOr perhaps only one.\\nMaybe I made a mistake.\\nAnother approach: set the difference as $ d = m - 1 $\\nThen $ |r - s| = d = m - 1 $\\nBut $ m = d + 1 $\\nSum $ r + s = m/2 = (d + 1)/2 $\\n$ (r - s)^2 = d^2 $\\n$ (r + s)^2 - 4rs = d^2 $\\n$ [(d+1)/2]^2 - 4(-4) = d^2 $\\n$ \\\\frac{(d+1)^2}{4} + 16 = d^2 $\\nMultiply by 4:\\n$ (d+1)^2 + 64 = 4d^2 $\\n$ d^2 + 2d + 1 + 64 = 4d^2 $\\n$ 3d^2 - 2d - 65 = 0 $\\nDiscriminant: $ 4 + 780 = 784 = 28^2 $\\n$ d = [2 ± 28]/6 $\\n$ d = 30/6 = 5 $, or $ d = -26/6 = -13/3 $\\nBut $ d = m - 1 = |r - s| \\\\geq 0 $, so $ d = 5 $\\nThen $ m = d + 1 = 6 $\\nSame result.\\nSo only $ m = 6 $\\n\\nThus answer to Problem 2 is 6.\\n\\nBut earlier I thought both, but upon careful consideration, only $ m=6 $ satisfies $ |r-s| = m-1 $ with $ m-1 \\\\geq 0 $.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1: k = 1\\nProblem 2: m = 6\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
