Then the equation becomes:\\ny^2 + y = 6 → y^2 + y - 6 = 0.\\nSolving: y = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 24)] / 2 = [-1 ± 5]/2.\\nSo y = 2 or y = -3. But y = 3^x > 0, so y = 2.\\nThus, 3^x = 2 → x = log3(2).\\nThen 1/x = 1 / log3(2) = log2(3).\\nNow compute 16^(1/x) + 4^(1/x).\\nNote: 16 = 2^4, 4 = 2^2.\\nSo 16^(1/x) = (2^4)^(log2(3)) = 2^(4 * log2(3)) = (2^(log2(3)))^4 = 3^4 = 81? Wait — no:\\nActually: (2^4)^(log2(3)) = 2^(4 * log2(3)) = (2^(log2(3)))^4 = 3^4 = 81? That’s incorrect because exponentiation rules:\\na^(b*c) = (a^b)^c, but here it's (a^b)^c = a^(b*c), which is correct.\\nBut 2^(4 * log2(3)) = (2^(log2(3)))^4 = 3^4 = 81? No!\\nWait: 2^(4 * log2(3)) = (2^(log2(3)))^4 = 3^4 = 81? That would be true only if exponent were multiplicative, but actually:\\n2^(4 * log2(3)) = (2^(log2(3)))^4 = 3^4 = 81? Let's test: log2(3) ≈ 1.58, 4*1.58=6.32, 2^6.32 ≈ 80–81, yes. But 3^4 = 81, correct.\\nBut wait: 2^(4 * log2(3)) = (2^(log2(3)))^4 = 3^4 = 81? Yes.\\nBut that seems too large. Let's double-check:\\nActually: a^(b*c) = (a^b)^c, and also a^(b*c) = (a^c)^b.\\nBut more importantly: 2^(k * log2(3)) = (2^(log2(3)))^k = 3^k.\\nSo 2^(4 * log2(3)) = 3^4 = 81? No! Wait: 2^(4 * log2(3)) = (2^(log2(3)))^4 = 3^4 = 81? Yes.\\nBut 16^(1/x) = (2^4)^(log2(3)) = 2^(4 * log2(3)) = 3^4 = 81?\\nWait — no! This is wrong.\\nLet’s clarify:\\nLet’s use logarithmic identity: a^(log_b(c)) is not necessarily simple.\\nBut we have: b^(log_b(c)) = c.\\nAnd more generally: a^(log_b(c)) = c^(log_b(a)).\\nBut better: use change of base.\\nWe have: 16^(1/x) = 16^(log2(3)) since 1/x = log2(3).\\nBut 16 = 2^4, so 16^(log2(3)) = (2^4)^(log2(3)) = 2^(4 * log2(3)) = (2^(log2(3)))^4 = 3^4 = 81.\\nSimilarly, 4^(1/x) = 4^(log2(3)) = (2^2)^(log2(3)) = 2^(2 * log2(3)) = (2^(log2(3)))^2 = 3^2 = 9.\\nSo total = 81 + 9 = 90.\\nBut let’s verify original equation: if 3^x = 2, then 9^x = (3^x)^2 = 4, so 4 + 2 = 6, correct.\\nThen 1/x = log_2(3)?\\nx = log3(2) = ln2/ln3, so 1/x = ln3/ln2 = log2(3), yes.\\nNow 16^(1/x) = 16^(log2(3)).\\nBut 16 = 2^4, so this is (2^4)^(log2(3)) = 2^(4 log2(3)) = (2^(log2(3)))^4 = 3^4 = 81.\\nSimilarly, 4^(1/x) = (2^2)^(log2(3)) = 2^(2 log2(3)) = 3^2 = 9.\\nSum: 81 + 9 = 90.\\nBut 90 seems large. Is there another way?\\nAlternatively, let z = 4^(1/x). Note 16^(1/x) = (4^2)^(1/x) = (4^(1/x))^2 = z^2.\\nSo we want z^2 + z.\\nNow 4^(1/x) = (2^2)^(1/x) = 2^(2/x).\\nBut 1/x = log2(3), so 2^(2 * log2(3)) = (2^(log2(3)))^2 = 3^2 = 9, same as before.\\nSo z = 9, z^2 = 81, sum 90.\\nBut let me compute numerically:\\n3^x = 2 → x ≈ log(2)/log(3) ≈ 0.3010 / 0.4771 ≈ 0.6309.\\nThen 1/x ≈ 1.584.\\nNow 16^(1.584) = ?\\n16^1.5 = (16^1)*(16^0.5)=16*4=64.\\n16^1.6 = 16^(8/5) = (16^8)^(1/5) = (4294967296)^(0.2). Or better: 16^1.6 = (2^4)^1.6 = 2^6.4 ≈ 84.4485 (since 2^6=64, 2^0.4≈1.3195, 64*1.3195≈84.45)\\nBut we need 16^1.584 ≈ ? 2^(4*1.584)=2^6.336 ≈ 2^6 * 2^0.336 ≈ 64 * 1.26 ≈ 80.64? Earlier I said 81.\\n2^0.3 ≈ 1.231, 2^0.336 ≈ interpolate: 0.3→1.231, 0.4→1.319, difference 0.088 over 0.1, so at 0.036: ~1.231 + 0.36*0.088 ≈ 1.231 + 0.0317 ≈ 1.2627.\\nSo 64 * 1.2627 ≈ 80.81.\\nSimilarly, 4^1.584 = (2^2)^1.584 = 2^3.168 ≈ 8 * 2^0.168 ≈ 8 * 1.124 ≈ 8.992 ≈ 9.\\nSum ≈ 80.81 + 8.99 ≈ 89.8 ≈ 90. So yes, approximately 90.\\nThus exact value is 81 + 9 = 90.\\nBut wait: is 2^(4 log2(3)) really 3^4?\\nYes: because 2^(log2(3)) = 3, so [2^(log2(3))]^4 = 3^4 = 81.\\nAnd exponent rules: 2^(4 * log2(3)) = [2^(log2(3))]^4 = 3^4 = 81.\\nSimilarly, 2^(2 * log2(3)) = 3^2 = 9.\\nSo answer is 81 + 9 = 90.\\nTherefore:\\nAnswer 1: 4\\nAnswer 2: 90\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"90\"\n}",
