In each round, the remaining players are paired at random, and within each pair, each player is equally likely to win (i.e., 50% chance), with the loser eliminated. The tournament proceeds for 5 rounds until one winner remains.\\n\\nWe are to compute the probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other at some point during the tournament. Then, instead of computing $100a + b$, we are told to find $e = b - 16$, where $\\\\frac{a}{b}$ is the reduced fraction representing the probability that they meet, and $a$ and $b$ are coprime.\\n\\nKey Insight:\\nIn a single-elimination knockout tournament with $n = 2^k$ players, the probability that two specific players meet during the tournament depends only on the structure of the bracket — but in this case, the pairing is *not* fixed in advance; rather, at each round, the remaining players are paired uniformly at random.\\n\\nThis is different from a standard seeded bracket. Here, since pairings are random in each round, we can use symmetry and recurrence.\\n\\nLet’s denote $P(n)$ as the probability that two specific players (Ava and Tiffany) meet during a random knockout tournament with $n = 2^k$ players, where in each round, survivors are randomly paired.\\n\\nWe want $P(32)$.\\n\\nThere is a known result: In a knockout tournament with random re-pairing at each round (not a fixed bracket), the probability that two specific players meet is $\\\\frac{2}{n}$.\\n\\nLet’s justify this.\\n\\nAlternative approach — Think about total number of games and symmetry:\\n\\n- Total number of games in a knockout tournament with 32 players: 31 games (each game eliminates one person, 31 eliminations needed).\\n- Each pair of players could potentially play. There are $\\\\binom{32}{2} = 496$ unordered pairs.\\n- Now, if all pairs were equally likely to be one of the 31 games played, then the probability that a particular pair (Ava vs Tiffany) occurs in one of the games would be $\\\\frac{31}{\\\\binom{32}{2}} = \\\\frac{31}{496} = \\\\frac{1}{16}$.\\n\\nBut is every pair equally likely to meet?\\n\\nYes — under random re-pairing at each round, due to symmetry, all pairs of players are indistinguishable in terms of meeting probability. So each of the $\\\\binom{32}{2}$ pairs has the same probability $p$ of meeting during the tournament.\\n\\nNow, the expected number of games is 31, and each game involves one pair. So the expected number of distinct pairs that actually play is 31.\\n\\nBut also, by linearity of expectation:\\n$$\\n\\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\text{number of pairs that play}] = \\\\sum_{\\\\text{all pairs}} \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\text{pair plays}) = \\\\binom{32}{2} \\\\cdot p = 496 p\\n$$\\nBut this must equal 31, so:\\n$$\\n496p = 31 \\\\Rightarrow p = \\\\frac{31}{496} = \\\\frac{31 \\\\div 31}{496 \\\\div 31} = \\\\frac{1}{16}\\n$$\\nWait: 496 ÷ 31 = 16? Let's check: 31 × 16 = 496. Yes.\\nSo $p = \\\\frac{1}{16}$.\\n\\nTherefore, the probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other is $\\\\frac{1}{16}$.\\n\\nSo $\\\\frac{a}{b} = \\\\frac{1}{16}$, with $a = 1$, $b = 16$, which are coprime.\\n\\nNow, the problem says: Instead of computing $100a + b$, compute $e = b - 16$.\\nSo $e = 16 - 16 = 0$.\\n\\nWait — is this correct?\\n\\nBut let me double-check the logic.\\n\\nIs it valid to say that because the expected number of playing pairs is 31, and there are $\\\\binom{n}{2}$ pairs, each with equal probability $p$, then $p = \\\\frac{2}{n}$?\\n\\nIndeed: $\\\\binom{n}{2} p = n - 1 \\\\Rightarrow p = \\\\frac{2(n-1)}{n(n-1)} = \\\\frac{2}{n}$?\\nWait! Mistake here!\\n\\nWait: $\\\\binom{n}{2} = \\\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, so:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\\\cdot p = n - 1 \\\\Rightarrow p = \\\\frac{2(n-1)}{n(n-1)} = \\\\frac{2}{n}\\n$$\\nAh! So $p = \\\\frac{2}{n}$, not $\\\\frac{1}{n/2}$.\\n\\nFor $n = 32$, $p = \\\\frac{2}{32} = \\\\frac{1}{16}$ — same answer!\\n\\nSo in this case, it still gives $\\\\frac{1}{16}$.\\n\\nBut let's verify:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\\\cdot p = n - 1 \\\\Rightarrow p = \\\\frac{2(n-1)}{n(n-1)} = \\\\frac{2}{n}\\n$$\\nYes, so $p = \\\\frac{2}{n}$.\\n\\nSo for $n=32$, $p = \\\\frac{2}{32} = \\\\frac{1}{16}$.\\n\\nSo yes, the probability is $\\\\frac{1}{16}$.\\n\\nThus $a = 1$, $b = 16$, so $e = b - 16 = 16 - 16 = 0$.\\n\\nBut wait — is the assumption valid? Are all pairs equally likely to meet?\\n\\nYes — because the pairings are completely random at each stage, and all players are symmetric. No player is special. So for any two distinct players, the probability they meet during the tournament is the same.\\n\\nAnd since the total number of games is $n - 1 = 31$, and each game involves one pair, the sum over all $\\\\binom{32}{2}$ pairs of the indicator that they meet is exactly 31 (since 31 games are played, each contributing one pair).\\n\\nSo by symmetry and linearity of expectation, each pair has probability $p = \\\\frac{2}{n} = \\\\frac{1}{16}$ of meeting.\\n\\nHence, confirmed.\\n\\nTherefore, $e = b - 16 = 16 - 16 = 0$.\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 1: 0\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe are to find a real number $p$ and an integer $c \\\\neq 0$ such that for all positive real numbers $x$ with $0 < x < 10^{-100}$,\\n$$\\nc - 0.1 < x^{p} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{1 + (1+x)^{10}} \\\\right) < c + 0.1\\n$$\\nand find the ordered pair $(p, c)$.\\n\\nNote: $x$ is very small, approaching 0 from the right.\\n\\nWe analyze the expression:\\n$$\\nf(x) = x^{p} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{1 + (1+x)^{10}}\\n$$\\nWe want this to be close to an integer $c \\\\neq 0$ for very small $x > 0$.\\n\\nFirst, expand $(1+x)^{10}$ using the binomial theorem:\\n$$\\n(1+x)^{10} = 1 + 10x + 45x^2 + 120x^3 + 210x^4 + 252x^5 + \\\\cdots + x^{10}\\n$$\\nSo for small $x$:\\n$$\\n(1+x)^{10} = 1 + 10x + O(x^2)\\n$$\\nThen:\\n$$\\n1 - (1+x)^{10} = 1 - (1 + 10x + 45x^2 + \\\\cdots) = -10x - 45x^2 - \\\\cdots = -10x + O(x^2)\\n$$\\n$$\\n1 + (1+x)^{10} = 1 + 1 + 10x + O(x^2) = 2 + 10x + O(x^2)\\n$$\\nSo the fraction becomes:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{-10x + O(x^2)}{2 + 10x + O(x^2)}\\n$$\\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2:\\n$$\\n= \\\\frac{-5x + O(x^2)}{1 + 5x + O(x^2)}\\n$$\\nNow, for small $z$, $\\\\frac{1}{1+z} = 1 - z + z^2 - \\\\cdots$, so:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{-5x + O(x^2)}{1 + 5x + O(x^2)} = (-5x + O(x^2)) \\\\cdot (1 - 5x + O(x^2)) = -5x + O(x^2)\\n$$\\nMore carefully:\\n$$\\n(-5x + O(x^2))(1 - 5x + O(x^2)) = -5x \\\\cdot 1 + (-5x)(-5x) + O(x^2) = -5x + 25x^2 + O(x^2)\\n$$\\nBut $O(x^2)$ absorbs $25x^2$, so overall:\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1 - (1+x)^{10}}{1 + (1+x)^{10}} = -5x + O(x^2)\\n$$\\nTherefore,\\n$$\\nf(x) = x^p \\\\cdot (-5x + O(x^2)) = -5 x^{p+1} + O(x^{p+2})\\n$$\\nWe want this expression to be bounded between $c - 0.1$ and $c + 0.1$ for all sufficiently small $x > 0$, i.e., $0 < x < 10^{-100}$.\\n\\nNow, depending on $p$, the behavior changes.\\n\\nCase 1: If $p+1 > 0$, then $x^{p+1} \\\\to 0$ as $x \\\\to 0^+$, so $f(x) \\\\to 0$. But $c \\\\neq 0$, so cannot be approximating a non-zero constant unless the limit is $c$. But if it goes to 0, then $c = 0$, which is disallowed.\\n\\nCase 2: If $p+1 < 0$, then $x^{p+1} \\\\to \\\\infty$ (since $x \\\\to 0^+$, negative exponent blows up), and multiplied by $-5$, so $f(x) \\\\to -\\\\infty$ or $+\\\\infty$ depending on sign. But it would blow up, so cannot stay within $c \\\\pm 0.1$.\\n\\nCase 3: $p+1 = 0$, i.e., $p = -1$.\\n\\nThen:\\n$$\\nf(x) = -5 x^{0} + O(x^{1}) = -5 + O(x)\\n$$\\nAs $x \\\\to 0^+$, $f(x) \\\\to -5$, and for very small $x$, $f(x)$ is close to $-5$.\\n\\nSpecifically, $f(x) = -5 + O(x)$, so for $x < 10^{-100}$, the error is less than $0.1$ in absolute value (since $O(x)$ means bounded by $C x$ for some constant $C$, and $x$ is tiny).\\n\\nTherefore, for sufficiently small $x$, say $x < \\\\delta$, we have:\\n$$\\n|f(x) + 5| < 0.1 \\\\Rightarrow -5.1 < f(x) < -4.9\\n$$\\nSo $c - 0.1 < f(x) < c + 0.1$ with $c = -5$.\\n\\nAnd $c = -5 \\\\neq 0$, integer.\\n\\nThus, $p = -1$, $c = -5$.\\n\\nSo the ordered pair is $(-1, -5)$.\\n\\nIs this the only possibility?\\n\\nSuppose $p = -1$, we get $f(x) \\\\to -5$.\\nIf $p > -1$, then $p+1 > 0$, $x^{p+1} \\\\to 0$, so $f(x) \\\\to 0$, so $c = 0$, invalid.\\nIf $p < -1$, $p+1 < 0$, $x^{p+1} \\\\to \\\\infty$, so $|f(x)| \\\\to \\\\infty$, cannot stay bounded near a constant.\\nOnly when $p = -1$, $f(x)$ approaches a finite non-zero limit.\\n\\nHence, the only possible value is $p = -1$, $c = -5$.\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 2: $(-1, -5)$\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"(-1, -5)\"\n}",
