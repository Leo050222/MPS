First, compute the least common multiple of 23, 22, and 10.\\n\\n- 23 is prime.\\n- 22 = 2 × 11\\n- 10 = 2 × 5\\n\\nSo the LCM must include all prime factors: 2, 5, 11, and 23.\\nThus, lcm(23, 22, 10) = 2 × 5 × 11 × 23 = 10 × 11 = 110; 110 × 23 = 2530.\\nThen d = 2530 - 2528 = 2.\\n\\nProblem 2: We are given that 8a^a b^b = 27a^b b^a, where a and b are positive integers. Rearranging:\\n\\n(8/27) = (a^b b^a) / (a^a b^b) = a^{b-a} b^{a-b} = (a/b)^{b-a}\\n\\nLet r = a/b. Then (a/b)^{b-a} = r^{b-a} = (8/27)\\nBut note that b - a = -(a - b), so:\\n\\n(a/b)^{b-a} = (a/b)^{-(a-b)} = (b/a)^{a-b}\\nSo (b/a)^{a-b} = 8/27\\nLet x = a - b. Then (b/a)^x = 8/27 → (b/a)^x = 8/27\\nAlternatively, write:\\n\\n8 a^a b^b = 27 a^b b^a → 8/27 = a^{b-a} b^{a-b} = (a^{b-a}) (b^{a-b}) = (b/a)^{a-b}\\nSo (b/a)^{a-b} = 8/27\\nLet k = a - b. Then (b/a)^k = 8/27 → (a/b)^k = 27/8\\nSo (a/b)^k = 27/8 = (3/2)^3\\nTherefore, we can try a/b = 3/2 and k = 3.\\nSo a = 3m, b = 2m for some m, and a - b = m = k = 3 → m = 3\\nThen a = 9, b = 6\\nCheck: 8 * 9^9 * 6^6 vs 27 * 9^6 * 6^9\\nCompute ratio: (8/27) * (9^9 / 9^6) * (6^6 / 6^9) = (8/27) * 9^3 / 6^3 = (8/27) * (729 / 216)\\n729 / 27 = 27, 8 / 216 = 1/27 → wait better:\\n= (8/27) * (729 / 216) = (8 * 729) / (27 * 216)\\n729 / 27 = 27, 8 / 216 = 8 / 216 → better factor:\\n8 * 729 = 8 * 9^3 = 8 * (3^2)^3 = 8 * 3^6\\n27 * 216 = 3^3 * 6^3 = 3^3 * (2*3)^3 = 3^3 * 8 * 27 = 3^3 * 8 * 3^3 = 8 * 3^6\\nSo both sides equal → ratio = 1. So it works.\\nThus a = 9, b = 6 → a² + b² = 81 + 36 = 117.\\nAlternatively, check smaller values? Try a = 3, b = 2: then a-b = 1, (a/b)^1 = 3/2 ≠ 27/8. But (a/b)^k = 27/8 → if k=3, a/b = 3/2 → a=3m, b=2m, a-b=m=3 → m=3 → a=9, b=6 as above. So unique solution in this family. Try other possibilities? Suppose (a/b)^k = (3/2)^3, could k=1, a/b=27/8 → a=27, b=8. Check:\\nLeft: 8 * 27^27 * 8^8\\nRight: 27 * 27^8 * 8^27 → clearly not equal. Powers mismatch. So only plausible solution is a=9, b=6.\\nThus a² + b² = 81 + 36 = 117.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"117\"\n}",
