Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Part 1: Maximize $ x + y^2 + z^3 $** subject to $ x + y + z = 1 $, with $ x, y, z \\\\geq 0 $.\\n\\nWe want to maximize:\\n\\n$$\\nS = x + y^2 + z^3\\n$$\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\n$$\\nx + y + z = 1,\\\\quad x, y, z \\\\geq 0\\n$$\\n\\nSince $ x = 1 - y - z $, substitute into $ S $:\\n\\n$$\\nS = (1 - y - z) + y^2 + z^3 = 1 - y - z + y^2 + z^3\\n$$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\nS = 1 + y^2 - y + z^3 - z\\n$$\\n\\nNow define:\\n\\n$$\\nf(y, z) = y^2 - y + z^3 - z\\n$$\\n\\nWe want to maximize $ f(y, z) $ over $ y, z \\\\geq 0 $, $ y + z \\\\leq 1 $.\\n\\nLet’s analyze this function.\\n\\nNote that $ y^2 - y = y(y - 1) \\\\leq 0 $ for $ y \\\\in [0,1] $, and minimum at $ y = 0.5 $. Similarly, $ z^3 - z = z(z^2 - 1) \\\\leq 0 $ on $ [0,1] $, since $ z^2 \\\\leq 1 $.\\n\\nBut we are adding these to 1, so we want to minimize the negative impact.\\n\\nAlternatively, consider extreme values. Since the function is nonlinear, maximum likely occurs at boundary.\\n\\nTry boundary cases:\\n\\n**Case 1:** $ x = 1 $, then $ y = z = 0 $\\n\\nThen $ S = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 $\\n\\n**Case 2:** $ y = 1 $, $ x = z = 0 $: $ S = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 $\\n\\n**Case 3:** $ z = 1 $, $ x = y = 0 $: $ S = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 $\\n\\nAll give 1. Can we do better?\\n\\nTry $ z = 0.5 $, then $ x + y = 0.5 $\\n\\n$ S = x + y^2 + (0.5)^3 = x + y^2 + 0.125 $\\n\\nBut $ x = 0.5 - y $, so:\\n\\n$ S = 0.5 - y + y^2 + 0.125 = y^2 - y + 0.625 $\\n\\nThis quadratic in $ y $ has minimum at $ y = 0.5 $, value:\\n\\n$ (0.25) - 0.5 + 0.625 = 0.375 $? Wait:\\n\\nWait: $ y^2 - y + 0.625 $ at $ y = 0 $: $ 0 - 0 + 0.625 = 0.625 $\\n\\nAt $ y = 0.5 $: $ 0.25 - 0.5 + 0.625 = 0.375 $\\n\\nSo maximum at $ y = 0 $: $ S = 0.625 $\\n\\nLess than 1.\\n\\nWait — maybe try intermediate $ z $.\\n\\nGo back to expression:\\n\\n$ S = 1 - y - z + y^2 + z^3 $\\n\\nFix $ z $, then $ S = (y^2 - y) + (1 - z + z^3) $\\n\\nFor fixed $ z $, $ y^2 - y $ is minimized (most negative) at $ y = 0.5 $, maximized at endpoints $ y = 0 $ or $ y = 1 $\\n\\nSince coefficient of $ y^2 $ is positive, maximum of $ y^2 - y $ on $ [0, 1-y-z\\\\geq0] $ occurs at endpoints.\\n\\nSimilarly, likely maximum of $ S $ occurs when one variable is zero.\\n\\nTry setting $ x = 0 $. Then $ y + z = 1 $, so $ y = 1 - z $\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$ S = 0 + (1 - z)^2 + z^3 = 1 - 2z + z^2 + z^3 $\\n\\nDefine:\\n\\n$$\\nf(z) = z^3 + z^2 - 2z + 1,\\\\quad z \\\\in [0,1]\\n$$\\n\\nTake derivative:\\n\\n$ f'(z) = 3z^2 + 2z - 2 $\\n\\nSet to zero:\\n\\n$ 3z^2 + 2z - 2 = 0 $\\n\\nDiscriminant: $ 4 + 24 = 28 $, so $ z = \\\\frac{ -2 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{28} }{6} = \\\\frac{ -2 \\\\pm 2\\\\sqrt{7} }{6} = \\\\frac{ -1 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{7} }{3} $\\n\\nTake positive root: $ \\\\frac{ -1 + \\\\sqrt{7} }{3} \\\\approx \\\\frac{ -1 + 2.64575 }{3} \\\\approx \\\\frac{1.64575}{3} \\\\approx 0.5486 $\\n\\nCheck value:\\n\\n$ f(0.5486) \\\\approx (0.5486)^3 + (0.5486)^2 - 2(0.5486) + 1 $\\n\\nCompute:\\n\\n- $ z^2 \\\\approx 0.301 $\\n- $ z^3 \\\\approx 0.165 $\\n- So $ f \\\\approx 0.165 + 0.301 - 1.0972 + 1 = (0.466) - 1.0972 + 1 = 0.3688 $\\n\\nWait: 0.165 + 0.301 = 0.466; 0.466 - 1.0972 = -0.6312; +1 = 0.3688? That can’t be right because earlier we had 1.\\n\\nWait — no:\\n\\n$ f(z) = z^3 + z^2 - 2z + 1 $\\n\\nAt $ z = 0 $: $ f = 1 $\\nAt $ z = 1 $: $ 1 + 1 - 2 + 1 = 1 $\\nAt $ z = 0.5 $: $ 0.125 + 0.25 - 1 + 1 = 0.375 $\\nSo less than 1.\\n\\nBut we want **maximum**. Is it possible that maximum is greater than 1?\\n\\nWait — try $ y = 0 $. Then $ x + z = 1 $, so $ x = 1 - z $\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$ S = x + 0 + z^3 = 1 - z + z^3 $\\n\\nDefine $ g(z) = z^3 - z + 1 $, $ z \\\\in [0,1] $\\n\\nDerivative: $ g'(z) = 3z^2 - 1 $\\n\\nCritical point: $ z = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\approx 0.577 $\\n\\n$ g(0.577) \\\\approx (0.577)^3 - 0.577 + 1 \\\\approx 0.192 - 0.577 + 1 = 0.615 $\\n\\nAt $ z = 0 $: $ g = 1 $\\nAt $ z = 1 $: $ 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 $\\n\\nStill not above 1.\\n\\nWait — try $ z = 0 $: then $ x + y = 1 $, $ S = x + y^2 = 1 - y + y^2 $\\n\\nMinimize $ y^2 - y + 1 $: minimum at $ y = 0.5 $, value $ 0.25 - 0.5 + 1 = 0.75 $, max at endpoints $ y=0 $ or $ y=1 $: both give $ S=1 $\\n\\nSo far, maximum seems to be 1.\\n\\nBut wait — is there a way to get more than 1?\\n\\nNote that $ x \\\\leq 1 $, $ y^2 \\\\leq y $ since $ y \\\\leq 1 $, and $ z^3 \\\\leq z $ for $ z \\\\in [0,1] $\\n\\nBut $ y^2 \\\\leq y $, $ z^3 \\\\leq z $, so:\\n\\n$ x + y^2 + z^3 \\\\leq x + y + z = 1 $\\n\\nEquality holds when $ y^2 = y $ and $ z^3 = z $\\n\\nWhich means $ y = 0 $ or $ 1 $, $ z = 0 $ or $ 1 $\\n\\nBut $ x + y + z = 1 $\\n\\nSo possibilities:\\n\\n- $ y = 1, z = 0 \\\\Rightarrow x = 0 $: valid, $ S = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 $\\n- $ y = 0, z = 1 \\\\Rightarrow x = 0 $: $ S = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 $\\n- $ y = 0, z = 0 \\\\Rightarrow x = 1 $: $ S = 1 $\\n- $ y = 1, z = 1 $: impossible\\n\\nSo maximum is 1, achieved when two variables are zero, one is 1.\\n\\nBut now, the problem says: **Instead of finding the maximum, find $ k = z + \\\\frac{1}{2} $, where $ z $ is the value of the variable with the cubic term in the configuration that achieves the maximum.**\\n\\nThe maximum is 1, achieved at three points:\\n\\n1. $ (x,y,z) = (1,0,0) $: then $ z = 0 $\\n2. $ (0,1,0) $: $ z = 0 $\\n3. $ (0,0,1) $: $ z = 1 $\\n\\nIn case 3, $ z = 1 $, so $ k = z + 1/2 = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 $\\n\\nBut are all maximum points considered? The problem says \\\"the value of the variable z\\\" — but multiple configurations achieve maximum. However, only when $ z = 1 $ does the cubic term contribute fully.\\n\\nBut the maximum is also achieved when $ z = 0 $, e.g., at $ (1,0,0) $ or $ (0,1,0) $.\\n\\nSo which one to pick?\\n\\nBut note: the expression is $ x + y^2 + z^3 $. At $ (0,0,1) $, we get $ 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 $\\nAt $ (1,0,0) $: $ 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 $\\nSame value.\\n\\nBut the problem says: \\\"where $ z $ is the value of the variable with the cubic term in the non-negative real numbers $ x, y, z $ satisfying $ x + y + z = 1 $ that achieve this maximum.\\\"\\n\\nIt doesn't say “the” configuration, but rather, perhaps implies we take the $ z $ from a maximizing triple.\\n\\nBut multiple triples. However, notice that in the triple $ (0,0,1) $, $ z = 1 $, and this is the only one where $ z > 0 $ in a maximizer.\\n\\nBut the problem may imply we should take the configuration that maximizes the expression, and among those, perhaps we need to see if there's a unique $ z $, but there isn't.\\n\\nWait — but look back: the instruction is: \\\"find $ k = z + 1/2 $, where $ z $ is the value ... that achieve this maximum.\\\"\\n\\nIt's ambiguous. But perhaps we missed something.\\n\\nEarlier we said $ x + y^2 + z^3 \\\\leq x + y + z = 1 $, since $ y^2 \\\\leq y $, $ z^3 \\\\leq z $ for $ y,z \\\\in [0,1] $, with equality iff $ y^2 = y $ and $ z^3 = z $, i.e., $ y = 0 $ or $ 1 $, $ z = 0 $ or $ 1 $.\\n\\nSo the maximum is 1, achieved only when $ y \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\} $, $ z \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\} $, and $ x = 1 - y - z \\\\geq 0 $\\n\\nSo possible:\\n\\n- $ y=0, z=0 \\\\Rightarrow x=1 $\\n- $ y=0, z=1 \\\\Rightarrow x=0 $\\n- $ y=1, z=0 \\\\Rightarrow x=0 $\\n- $ y=1, z=1 \\\\Rightarrow x=-1 $: invalid\\n\\nSo three maximizers.\\n\\nIn two of them, $ z = 0 $; in one, $ z = 1 $\\n\\nBut the problem asks for $ k = z + 1/2 $, where $ z $ is the value in a maximizing triple.\\n\\nBut which one? It doesn't specify.\\n\\nUnless... is the maximum strictly greater than 1 somewhere?\\n\\nWait — suppose $ z > 1 $? But no, $ z \\\\leq 1 $, since $ x+y+z=1 $\\n\\nAnd $ z^3 \\\\leq z $, $ y^2 \\\\leq y $, so indeed $ x + y^2 + z^3 \\\\leq x + y + z = 1 $\\n\\nSo maximum is exactly 1, achieved at the three points.\\n\\nBut perhaps the problem intends for us to consider the configuration that maximizes $ x + y^2 + z^3 $, and among those, perhaps we need the one where $ z $ is as large as possible, or something.\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"the value of the variable z\\\", implying perhaps it's unique, but it's not.\\n\\nUnless... wait — in the expression $ x + y^2 + z^3 $, when we set $ z=1 $, $ x=y=0 $, we get $ 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 $\\nWhen $ x=1 $, others 0: $ 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 $\\nSame.\\n\\nBut perhaps we can check if any interior point gives more than 1.\\nSuppose $ x=0.9, y=0.1, z=0 $: $ S = 0.9 + 0.01 + 0 = 0.91 < 1 $\\nOr $ x=0, y=0.5, z=0.5 $: $ 0 + 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375 $\\nOr $ x=0, y=0, z=1 $: 1\\n\\nSeems 1 is maximum.\\n\\nBut now, the next part involves Andy moving on a segment, and expected distance to a point at distance $ k $ from H.\\n\\nPerhaps the intended maximizing configuration is when $ z $ is chosen to make $ z^3 $ large, but still, maximum is 1.\\n\\nWait — unless I made a mistake: is $ y^2 \\\\leq y $? Yes for $ y \\\\in [0,1] $\\n$ z^3 \\\\leq z $? Yes, since $ z^2 \\\\leq 1 $\\nSo $ y^2 + z^3 \\\\leq y + z $, so $ x + y^2 + z^3 \\\\leq x + y + z = 1 $\\nEquality iff $ y^2 = y $ and $ z^3 = z $, so $ y=0 $ or 1, $ z=0 $ or 1\\n\\nAs before.\\n\\nNow, in the context, perhaps they intend the maximum to be achieved when $ z $ is such that $ z^3 $ is emphasized, but mathematically, all three are valid.\\n\\nBut look at the definition: \\\"find $ k = z + 1/2 $, where $ z $ is the value of the variable with the cubic term in the ... that achieve this maximum.\\\"\\n\\nIt might be that in the maximum, $ z $ can be 0 or 1, but perhaps the problem expects the case where $ z $ is not zero, i.e., when the cubic term is active.\\n\\nMaybe we need to maximize $ x + y^2 + z^3 $, and it turns out that at maximum, $ z $ must be 1?\\n\\nBut no, as shown.\\n\\nUnless the maximum is greater than 1?\\n\\nTry $ z = 0.8 $, $ y = 0.2 $, $ x = 0 $: then $ S = 0 + 0.04 + 0.512 = 0.552 $\\nLess than 1.\\nOr $ z = 0.9 $, $ y = 0.1 $, $ x = 0 $: $ 0 + 0.01 + 0.729 = 0.739 $\\nStill less.\\nOr $ z = 1 $, $ x=y=0 $: 1\\nOr $ x=1 $: 1\\n\\nSame.\\n\\nBut what if we set $ y=0 $, $ x = 1 - z $, then $ S = 1 - z + z^3 $\\nMaximize $ g(z) = z^3 - z + 1 $\\n$ g'(z) = 3z^2 - 1 = 0 $ at $ z = 1/\\\\sqrt{3} \\\\approx 0.577 $\\n$ g(0.577) \\\\approx (0.192) - 0.577 + 1 = 0.615 < 1 $\\nAnd $ g(0) = 1 $, $ g(1) = 1 $\\nSo maximum is 1 at endpoints.\\n\\nSimilarly for other boundaries.\\n\\nSo maximum is 1, achieved when either $ x=1 $, or $ y=1 $, or $ z=1 $ (with others 0).\\n\\nNow, in the case where $ z=1 $, $ k = z + 1/2 = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 $\\n\\nBut the segment $ \\\\overline{HT} $ is 1-unit long, so a point at distance $ k=1.5 $ from H is outside the segment.\\n\\nThat seems problematic for the next part.\\n\\nPerhaps I misinterpreted the first part.\\n\\nRe-read: \\\"Instead of finding the maximum possible value of $ x + y^2 + z^3 $, simply find $ k = z + 1/2 $, where $ z $ is the value of the variable with the cubic term in the non-negative real numbers $ x, y, z $ satisfying $ x + y + z = 1 $ that achieve this maximum.\\\"\\n\\nAh! Perhaps it's not that we have to choose among the maximizers, but rather, in the maximizer, what is $ z $? But it's not unique.\\n\\nUnless... is there a unique maximizer?\\n\\nNo, there are three.\\n\\nBut perhaps for the purpose of the cubic term, they want the $ z $ when the maximum is achieved with $ z>0 $, but still, only one such point: $ z=1 $\\n\\nBut let's think differently. Maybe the maximum is not 1?\\n\\nWait — is $ y^2 \\\\leq y $? Only if $ y \\\\leq 1 $, which is true, yes.\\nBut $ x $ has no square, so to maximize, perhaps we should minimize the loss from $ y^2 < y $, so set $ y=0 $, then $ x + z = 1 $, $ S = x + z^3 = 1 - z + z^3 $\\nAs before, max is 1 at $ z=0 $ or $ z=1 $\\n\\nSame.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem is to maximize $ x + y^2 + z^3 $, and it turns out that the maximum is achieved when $ z $ is a particular value, not necessarily 0 or 1.\\n\\nBut our inequality shows it can't exceed 1, and equals 1 only at corners.\\n\\nUnless the inequality is strict inside, so maximum only at boundaries.\\n\\nBut at boundaries, we have the three points.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem has a typo, and it's minimize? But that would be small.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps \\\"non-negative real numbers\\\" and sum to 1, but maybe the maximum of $ x + y^2 + z^3 $ is achieved at an interior point for $ z $.\\n\\nBut our analysis shows it's at most 1, and 1 is achieved, so maximum is 1.\\n\\nPerhaps they want the supremum, but it's attained.\\n\\nAnother thought: in the expression $ x + y^2 + z^3 $, if we set $ x=0 $, $ y=0 $, $ z=1 $, we get 1.\\nIf we set $ x=0 $, $ y=1 $, $ z=0 $, we get 1.\\nBut is there a point where it's greater than 1?\\nSuppose $ z=1.1 $, but then $ x+y+z \\\\geq 1.1 > 1 $, impossible.\\nSo no.\\n\\nPerhaps the cubic term allows larger contribution, but no, $ z^3 \\\\leq z $ for $ z \\\\in [0,1] $.\\n\\nUnless $ z>1 $, but can't.\\n\\nSo I think the maximum is 1, achieved when one variable is 1, others 0.\\n\\nNow, for the next part, Andy moves on a 1-unit segment HT.\\nHe starts at midpoint, so at 0.5 if H is at 0, T at 1.\\nHe flips 2010 coins.\\nIf heads, he moves halfway towards H.\\nIf tails, halfway towards T.\\nAfter 2010 moves, we want expected distance between Andy and the point at distance k from H.\\n\\nBut k = z + 1/2, and z is from the maximizing configuration.\\n\\nBut z could be 0 or 1, giving k=0.5 or 1.5.\\n\\nIf k=1.5, it's outside [0,1], so distance would be |position - 1.5|, which is at least 0.5.\\n\\nBut perhaps the intended answer is when z=1, so k=1.5.\\n\\nBut let's read the problem again: \\\"Indecisive Andy starts out at the midpoint...\\\" and so on.\\n\\nThis process is a well-known expected value problem.\\n\\nLet me denote the position.\\nLet H be at 0, T at 1.\\nStart at 0.5.\\nEach move: if heads, move to halfway towards H, i.e., new position = (current + 0)/2 = current/2.\\nIf tails, move to halfway towards T, i.e., new position = (current + 1)/2.\\n\\nSo the update is:\\n- With prob 1/2: X_{n+1} = X_n / 2\\n- With prob 1/2: X_{n+1} = (X_n + 1)/2\\n\\nWe start with X_0 = 0.5\\nAfter 2010 steps, we want E[ |X_{2010} - k| ], where k is to be determined.\\n\\nBut the problem is to find this expected distance, but k depends on the first part.\\n\\nBut in the first part, if we take the configuration where z=1, then k=1.5\\nIf z=0, k=0.5\\n\\n0.5 is the starting point, and also the expected value might be around there.\\n\\nBut let's compute the expected position.\\nLet mu_n = E[X_n]\\nThen:\\nE[X_{n+1}] = (1/2) * E[X_n / 2] + (1/2) * E[(X_n + 1)/2] = (1/2)(1/2) mu_n + (1/2)(1/2)(mu_n + 1) = (1/4) mu_n + (1/4) mu_n + 1/4 = (1/2) mu_n + 1/4\\n\\nSo mu_{n+1} = (1/2) mu_n + 1/4\\nWith mu_0 = 0.5\\nThis is a linear recurrence.\\nSolve it.\\nHomogeneous solution: mu_h = A (1/2)^n\\nParticular solution: constant, mu_p = c, then c = (1/2)c + 1/4 => c/2 = 1/4 => c = 1/2\\nGeneral solution: mu_n = A (1/2)^n + 1/2\\nInitial: n=0, mu_0 = A + 1/2 = 0.5 => A = 0\\nSo mu_n = 1/2 for all n\\n\\nSo expected position is always 0.5\\n\\nNow, the variance or distribution might be complicated, but the expected distance to a point.\\n\\nIf k=0.5, then E[ |X_n - 0.5| ]\\nIf k=1.5, E[ |X_n - 1.5| ]\\n\\nBut the problem is to find this expected distance after 2010 moves.\\n\\nBut without knowing k, we can't proceed.\\n\\nBack to the first part. Perhaps I missed that the maximum is not 1.\\n\\nLet me try to maximize f(z) = 1 - z + z^3 for z in [0,1], with y=0, x=1-z\\nBut as before, max is 1.\\n\\nPerhaps with y>0.\\nSuppose we set x=0, then y+ z =1, S = y^2 + z^3 = (1-z)^2 + z^3 = 1 -2z + z^2 + z^3\\nLet h(z) = z^3 + z^2 -2z +1\\nh'(z) = 3z^2 +2z -2\\nSet to 0: z = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 24)]/6 = [-2 ± sqrt(28)]/6 = [-2 ± 2sqrt(7)]/6 = [-1 ± sqrt(7)]/3\\nsqrt(7)≈2.645, so z≈ ( -1 + 2.645)/3 ≈ 1.645/3 ≈ 0.548\\nh(0.548) = (0.548)^3 + (0.548)^2 -2*0.548 +1 ≈ 0.165 + 0.300 - 1.096 +1 = (0.465) -1.096 +1 = 0.369\\n<1\\nSo less than 1.\\n\\nOther combinations seem less.\\n\\nPerhaps the maximum is when z is chosen to make z^3 large, but still capped.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps \"achieve this maximum\" and they mean the maximum value is achieved, and for that, z can be 0 or 1, but perhaps in the context, since it's z^3, and they ask for z, maybe they want the z when the maximum is achieved with z>0, so z=1, k=1.5\\n\\nBut let's look at the second part. Andy's position after many steps.\\nIt is known that this process makes the position converge in distribution to a uniform distribution or something? Let's see.\\n\\nThe map is: with prob 1/2, X -> X/2, with prob 1/2, X -> (X+1)/2\\nThis is a iterated function system, and the stationary distribution is the uniform distribution on [0,1]? Let's check.\\n\\nFor uniform on [0,1], if X~Uniform[0,1], then X/2 ~ Uniform[0,0.5], (X+1)/2 ~ Uniform[0.5,1], so the mixture is uniform on [0,1]. Yes! So the stationary distribution is Uniform[0,1].\\n\\nMoreover, since it's ergodic, after many steps, the distribution is very close to Uniform[0,1].\\n\\nWith 2010 steps, very large, so X_{2010} is approximately Uniform[0,1].\\n\\nExpected value is 0.5, as we saw.\\n\\nNow, if k = 0.5, then E[ |X - 0.5| ] for X~Uniform[0,1] = \\int_0^1 |x-0.5| dx = 2 \\int_0^{0.5} (0.5 - x) dx = 2 [ 0.5x - x^2/2 ]_0^{0.5} = 2 [ 0.5*0.5 - (0.25)/2 ] = 2 [ 0.25 - 0.125 ] = 2*0.125 = 0.25\\n\\nIf k=1.5, E[ |X - 1.5| ] = \\int_0^1 (1.5 - x) dx = [1.5x - x^2/2]_0^1 = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1\\n\\nBut 1 is larger, and perhaps not nice.\\n\\nBut in the first part, if we take the configuration where x=1, y=z=0, then z=0, k=0+0.5=0.5\\nIf we take y=1, x=z=0, z=0, k=0.5\\nIf we take z=1, x=y=0, z=1, k=1.5\\nSo in two out of three maximizers, k=0.5, in one, k=1.5\\nSo perhaps the problem intends k=0.5, as it's more common.\\n\\nBut the problem says \"the value\", implying unique.\\n\\nPerhaps for the maximum to be achieved, and since when z=1, it's achieved, but also when z=0.\\n\\nAnother thought: perhaps the maximum of x + y^2 + z^3 is not 1, but higher, if we allow trade-offs.\\nFor example, set z=0.8, then z^3=0.512, then x+y=0.2, and x + y^2 ≤ x + y = 0.2, since y^2 ≤ y, so S ≤ 0.2 + 0.512 = 0.712 <1\\nOr z=0.9, z^3=0.729, x+y=0.1, S≤0.1 + 0.1 =0.2? No, x + y^2 ≤ x + y =0.1, so S≤0.1 + 0.729=0.829<1\\nZ=0.99, z^3=0.970299, x+y=0.01, S≤0.01 + 0.01=0.02? x + y^2 ≤ 0.01 + 0.01 =0.02 if y=0.01, but y^2=0.0001, so x + y^2 ≤ 0.01 + 0.0001=0.0101, so S≤0.0101 + 0.970299=0.9804<1\\nZ=1, S=1\\nSo indeed, only at z=1 or when z=0 but x=1 or y=1.\n\nBut when z=0 and x=1, S=1, same as when z=1.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nPerhaps the problem is to minimize, but that would be small.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"non-negative real numbers\" but the maximum is when we set z as large as possible for the cubic, but still.\n\nPerhaps in the expression, it's x + y^2 + z^3, and to maximize, we should set x=0, and then maximize y^2 + z^3 with y+z=1.\n\nAs before, max is less than 1.\n\nOr set y=0, maximize x + z^3 with x+z=1, i.e., 1-z + z^3, which is at most 1.\n\nSo I think the maximum is 1, and it's achieved when z=0 or z=1.\n\nBut perhaps the problem has a different interpretation.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"find k = z + 1/2, where z is the value of the variable with the cubic term in the non-negative real numbers x,y,z satisfying x+y+z=1 that achieve this maximum.\"\n\nPerhaps \"that achieve this maximum\" refers to the triple, and for each such triple, z is defined, but it's not unique.\n\nHowever, in the context of the next part, if k=0.5, then the expected distance is 0.25, as calculated.\n\nIf k=1.5, it's 1.\n\n0.25 is a nice number.\n\nMoreover, 0.5 is the starting point, and the expected position is 0.5, so distance to 0.5 might be natural.\n\nAlso, in two out of three maximizers, z=0, so k=0.5.\n\nPerhaps the problem intends for us to take the z from the configuration where the cubic term is used, but even then, when z=1, it's used.\n\nBut let's think about the title \"Indecisive Andy\" – he moves halfway each time, so his position is changing.\n\nAfter many steps, as said, approximately uniform.\n\nNow, the point at distance k from H.\n\nH is at 0, so the point is at k.\n\nIf k=0.5, then E[|X - 0.5|] for X~Unif[0,1] = 0.25\n\nAnd 0.25 = 1/4.\n\nIs that the answer?\n\nBut why would k=0.5?\n\nBecause in the maximizing configuration, when we achieve the maximum, often z=0.\n\nBut the problem might be designed so that k=0.5.\n\nPerhaps I miscalculated the maximum.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the maximum is not 1, because when we set z=1, x=y=0, S=1, but if we set z=0, x=1, y=0, S=1, same.\n\nBut perhaps for the cubic term, they want the value when it's not zero, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\nPerhaps \" the value\" implies there is a unique z, but there isn't.\n\nUnless we consider that to achieve the maximum, z must be 0 or 1, but for the expression to be 1, and since y^2 ≤ y, etc., but no.\n\nPerhaps in the configuration that maximizes, we need to see which one has the cubic term, but all are symmetric in a way.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the maximum is achieved when z is such that the derivative is zero, but in the interior, it's less than 1.\n\nFor example, with y=0, S = 1 - z + z^3, derivative -1 + 3z^2 =0 when z=1/sqrt(3)≈0.577, S=1 - 0.577 + (0.577)^3 ≈ 1 - 0.577 + 0.192 = 0.615<1.\n\nSo not maximum.\n\nPerhaps the problem is to minimize, but then it would be when z=0, y=0, x=1, S=1, or when y=1, S=1, same as minimum? No, if y=0.5, z=0.5, x=0, S=0 + 0.25 + 0.125=0.375, smaller.\n\nMinimum is 0, when x=y=z=1/3, S=1/3 + (1/3)^2 + (1/3)^3 = 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 = 9/27 + 3/27 + 1/27 = 13/27≈0.481, or lower.\n\nAt (1,0,0), S=1, at (0,0,1), S=1, at (0,0.5,0.5), S=0 + 0.25 + 0.125=0.375, at (0,1,0), S=1, so minimum is less than 1.\n\nBut the problem says \"maximum\".\n\nPerhaps I have a fundamental mistake.\n\nLet me double-check with a different approach.\n\nLet me use Lagrange multipliers, but with inequalities.\n\nAssume interior point, x>0,y>0,z>0, x+y+z=1.\n\nLet f = x + y^2 + z^3, g = x+y+z-1=0.\n\nGrad f = (1, 2y, 3z^2), grad g = (1,1,1)\n\nSo 1 = lambda, 2y = lambda, 3z^2 = lambda\n\nSo lambda = 1, so 2y = 1 => y=0.5, 3z^2 =1 => z^2=1/3, z=1/sqrt(3)≈0.577\n\nThen x = 1 - y - z = 1 - 0.5 - 0.577 = -0.077 <0, not feasible.\n\nSo no interior maximum.\n\nOn boundaries.\n\nBoundary x=0: then y+z=1, f = 0 + y^2 + z^3 = (1-z)^2 + z^3 = 1 -2z + z^2 + z^3\n\nAs before, h(z) = z^3 + z^2 -2z +1, h'(z) = 3z^2 +2z -2=0, z= [-2±sqrt(4+24)]/6 = [-2±2sqrt(7)]/6 = [-1±sqrt(7)]/3\n\nz= (-1+sqrt(7))/3 ≈ ( -1+2.645)/3 = 1.645/3≈0.548\n\nThen y=1-0.548=0.452, x=0\n\nf = (0.452)^2 + (0.548)^3 ≈ 0.204 + 0.165 = 0.369\n\nAt z=0, y=1, f=1\nAt z=1, y=0, f=1\n\nSo on this edge, maximum is 1.\n\nBoundary y=0: then x+z=1, f = x + 0 + z^3 = 1-z + z^3\n\ng(z) = z^3 - z +1, g'(z) = 3z^2 -1=0, z=1/sqrt(3)≈0.577, g= (0.577)^3 -0.577 +1 ≈ 0.192 -0.577 +1 = 0.615\n\nAt z=0, x=1, f=1\nAt z=1, x=0, f=1\n\nSo again, max 1.\n\nBoundary z=0: x+y=1, f = x + y^2 = 1-y + y^2\n\ni(y) = y^2 - y +1, i'(y) = 2y-1=0, y=0.5, i=0.25-0.5+1=0.75\n\nAt y=0, x=1, f=1\nAt y=1, x=0, f=1\n\nSo maximum is 1, achieved at the vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1).\n\nNow, at (0,0,1), z=1\nAt (0,1,0), z=0\nAt (1,0,0), z=0\n\nSo z=1 in one case, z=0 in two cases.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects k=0.5, corresponding to z=0.\n\nMaybe \" the variable with the cubic term\" and in the maximum, its value is not unique, but perhaps they want the value when it's not zero, but the problem doesn't say.\n\nPerhaps in the context, since Andy is indecisive, and moves, perhaps k=0.5 is the midpoint.\n\nMoreover, in the expected distance, if k=0.5, and after many steps, X is approximately uniform on [0,1], then E[|X - 0.5|] = \\int_0^1 |x-0.5| dx = 2 \\int_0^{0.5} (0.5 - x) dx = 2 [0.5x - x^2/2]_0^{0.5} = 2 [0.25 - 0.125] = 2*0.125 = 0.25\n\nAnd 0.25 = 1/4.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 1/4.\n\nIf k=1.5, E[|X-1.5|] = \\int_0^1 (1.5 - x) dx = [1.5x - x^2/2]_0^1 = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1, which is larger, and less elegant.\n\nSo likely k=0.5, so z=0.\n\nWhy z=0? Because in the majority of maximizing configurations, z=0.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that for the maximum to be achieved, z must be 0 or 1, but the value k= z+1/2, and perhaps they want the expected k or something, but not specified.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \" the value\" means the value that z takes in the optimal solution, but since there are multiple, perhaps we need to take the one that is used in the cubic term, but when z=1, it is used.\n\nBut let's look at the expression: \"find k = z + 1/2\", and then use it for the distance.\n\nPerhaps in the standard interpretation, when we maximize x + y^2 + z^3, and since x has no penalty, we should set x as large as possible, but then y and z small, but then y^2 and z^3 are small, but x is large.\n\nIn fact, at (1,0,0), S=1, same as others.\n\nBut perhaps for the cubic term to be significant, but the problem doesn't prioritize.\n\nPerhaps the maximum is unique if we consider the cubic, but it's not.\n\nI recall that in some optimization problems, if there are multiple optima, we take the one with largest z or something, but not specified.\n\nPerhaps the problem has a typo, and it's minimize, but then minimum is not at vertices.\n\nFor example, with x=0,y=0,z=1, S=1, but at x=0,y=1,z=0, S=1, at x=0.5,y=0.5,z=0, S=0.5 + 0.25 =0.75, at x=0,y=0.5,z=0.5, S=0 + 0.25 + 0.125=0.375, at x=1/3,y=1/3,z=1/3, S=1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 = 9/27 + 3/27 + 1/27 = 13/27≈0.481, so minimum is when y and z are balanced, but not at vertex.\n\nBut the problem says maximum.\n\nPerhaps it's maximize, and they want the z for which the maximum is achieved, and in the context, perhaps when z=1.\n\nBut let's try to see the answer.\n\nPerhaps \"k = z + 1/2\" and z is not the value, but something else.\n\nAnother interpretation: \"find k = z + 1/2\" where z is the value that achieves the maximum, but z is the variable, so in the optimal solution, what is z.\n\nBut as said, it can be 0 or 1.\n\nPerhaps for the maximum of x + y^2 + z^3, the optimal z is 1, because if you set z<1, you lose.\n\nBut you can achieve the same with z=0.\n\nPerhaps the problem is to maximize, and the maximum is 1, and it is achieved when z=1, among other places, but perhaps they want that instance.\n\nBut still.\n\nPerhaps in the expression, since it's z^3, and for z<1, z^3 < z, but in the sum, it's compensated.\n\nI think the only way is to assume that in the maximizing configuration, z=0 or 1, but for the sake of the problem, since the expected distance might be asked, and if k=0.5, answer is 0.25, if k=1.5, answer is 1.\n\n0.25 is more reasonable.\n\nPerhaps k=1, if z=0.5, but at z=0.5, S is not maximum.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \" the value of the variable with the cubic term\" means that we should consider z as the choice, and for the maximum, what is z, but it's not unique.\n\nPerhaps the maximum is achieved only when z=1, but that's not true.\n\nUnless the problem has a constraint I missed.\n\n\"non-negative real numbers\" , sum to 1.\n\nPerhaps they are positive, but then no maximum, supremum 1.\n\nBut not.\n\nI recall that in some problems, they ask for the maximum, and it's at a corner.\n\nPerhaps for this problem, since it's \"Indecisive Andy\", and he starts at midpoint, and moves, and the point is at k, and if k=0.5, it's the start, so expected distance to start.\n\nAfter many random moves, expected distance to start is 0.25 for uniform.\n\nSo likely that's it.\n\nPerhaps z=0 in the optimal solution for some reason.\n\nLet's calculate the maximum again.\n\nSuppose we set x=0, then S = y^2 + z^3, y+ z=1.\n\nMax of y^2 + (1-y)^3.\n\nLet p(y) = y^2 + (1-y)^3 = y^2 + 1 -3y +3y^2 - y^3 = -y^3 +4y^2 -3y +1\n\np'(y) = -3y^2 +8y -3\n\nSet to 0: 3y^2 -8y +3=0, discriminant 64-36=28, y= [8±2sqrt(7)]/6 = [4±sqrt(7)]/3\n\nsqrt(7)≈2.645, so y≈ (4-2.645)/3≈1.355/3≈0.4517, or y=(4+2.645)/3=6.645/3=2.215>1, invalid.\n\ny≈0.4517, z=1-y≈0.5483, S= (0.4517)^2 + (0.5483)^3 ≈ 0.204 + 0.165 = 0.369, as before.\n\nLess than 1.\n\nSo indeed, maximum is 1 at corners.\n\nNow, perhaps the problem intends for us to take the configuration where the cubic term is maximized, but in the context of the sum, but still.\n\nPerhaps \" that achieve this maximum\" and since when z=1, it achieves, and z=1 is larger, so take z=1.\n\nBut then k=1.5.\n\nThen expected distance to 1.5.\n\nWith X in [0,1], |X-1.5| = 1.5 - X, since X≤1<1.5.\n\nSo E[|X-1.5|] = E[1.5 - X] = 1.5 - E[X] = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1.\n\nSo answer 1.\n\nBut 1 is also a nice number.\n\nOr 0.25.\n\nBoth are possible.\n\nPerhaps k=1, if z=0.5, but not optimal.\n\nAnother thought: in the first part, \"find k = z + 1/2\", and z is the value, but perhaps for the maximum, the optimal z is 0, because if you set z>0, you might lose, but you can achieve the same.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that to achieve the maximum, you must have z=0 or z=1, but the value k is to be found, and perhaps they want the average or something.\n\nBut not specified.\n\nPerhaps in the context of the cubic term, and since it's z^3, and for z<1, it's less, but still.\n\nI recall that in some similar problems, the maximum is at z=1.\n\nPerhaps for the expression x + y^2 + z^3, with x+y+z=1, the maximum is 1, and it is achieved when z=1, and that's the only place where the cubic term is 1, but in other places, it's 0, but the sum is the same.\n\nBut the problem asks for z in the configuration that achieves the maximum, so any such configuration.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects k=1.5.\n\nLet's try to see the answer from the second part.\n\nAfter 2010 moves, with high probability, the distribution is very close to uniform on [0,1].\n\nSo E[|X - k|] = \\int_0^1 |x - k| dx\n\nIf k <=0, then |x-k| = x-k for x in [0,1], so \\int_0^1 (x-k) dx = [x^2/2 - kx]_0^1 = 0.5 - k\n\nIf k >=1, then |x-k| = k-x, so \\int_0^1 (k-x) dx = [k x - x^2/2]_0^1 = k - 0.5\n\nIf 0<k<1, then \\int_0^k (k-x) dx + \\int_k^1 (x-k) dx = [k x - x^2/2]_0^k + [x^2/2 - k x]_k^1 = (k^2 - k^2/2) + ((1/2 - k) - (k^2/2 - k^2)) = (k^2/2) + (0.5 - k - k^2/2 + k^2) wait.\n\nFirst integral: \\int_0^k (k-x) dx = [ kx - x^2/2 ]_0^k = k* k - k^2/2 = k^2 - k^2/2 = k^2/2\n\nSecond integral: \\int_k^1 (x-k) dx = [ x^2/2 - k x ]_k^1 = (1/2 - k) - (k^2/2 - k* k) = (0.5 - k) - (k^2/2 - k^2) = 0.5 - k - (-k^2/2) = 0.5 - k + k^2/2\n\nSo total = k^2/2 + 0.5 - k + k^2/2 = k^2 - k + 0.5\n\nSo summary:\n- if k ≤ 0, E[|X-k|] = 0.5 - k\n- if 0<k<1, E[|X-k|] = k^2 - k + 0.5\n- if k ≥ 1, E[|X-k|] = k - 0.5\n\nNow, if k=0.5, which is in (0,1), E = (0.5)^2 - 0.5 + 0.5 = 0.25 -0.5 +0.5 = 0.25\n\nIf k=1.5, k>1, E = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, 0.25 or 1.\n\nNow, perhaps the problem has k=0.5.\n\nBut why? Because in the first part, if we take the configuration where x=1, y=0, z=0, then z=0, k=0+0.5=0.5\n\nAnd this is a valid maximizing configuration.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that for the cubic term, but in this case z=0.\n\nPerhaps \" the variable with the cubic term\" and its value is 0 in some cases.\n\nBut let's look back at the problem: \"find k = z + 1/2, where z is the value of the variable with the cubic term in the ... that achieve this maximum.\"\n\nPerhaps they mean that in the optimal solution, what is z, and since it can be 0 or 1, but perhaps in the context, or perhaps they want the value for which the maximum is uniquely achieved, but it's not.\n\nPerhaps for the maximum to be 1, and since when z=1, it is achieved, and when z=0, it is also, but perhaps the problem assumes that we set z to maximize its own term, but not.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \" the value\" means the optimal value of z, but it's not unique, so perhaps we need to take the average or something.\n\nAverage of z over the maximizers: at (1,0,0): z=0, at (0,1,0): z=0, at (0,0,1): z=1, so average z = (0+0+1)/3 = 1/3, then k = 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6 ≈0.833\n\nThen E[|X-k|] = since k=5/6≈0.833 in (0,1), so k^2 - k + 0.5 = (25/36) - 5/6 + 0.5 = 25/36 - 30/36 + 18/36 = (25-30+18)/36 = 13/36 ≈0.361\n\nNot nice.\n\nOr median, etc.\n\nPerhaps only the configuration where the cubic term is used, i.e., (0,0,1), so z=1, k=1.5, E=1.\n\nOr perhaps when no cubic, but then z=0.\n\nI think the most reasonable is that since the expected position is 0.5, and the start is 0.5, and k=0.5, then expected distance is 0.25.\n\nPerhaps in the first part, when they say \"the value\", they mean the value when the maximum is achieved with z as large as possible, so z=1, k=1.5.\n\nBut let's try to search for similar problems or think differently.\n\nAnother thought: in the expression x + y^2 + z^3, to maximize, since x has coefficient 1, and no reduction, while y^2 ≤ y, z^3 ≤ z, so to have no loss, we should set y and z to 0 or 1, but to have x as large as possible, but at (1,0,0), x=1, at (0,0,1), x=0, so to have x large, we should set y=0, z=0, x=1.\n\nIn that case, z=0, k=0.5.\n\nAnd this configuration gives the maximum, and has no \"waste\" in the sense that y^2 = y=0, z^3= z=0, so no loss, whereas in (0,0,1), z^3=1, z=1, so no loss, but x=0, so the linear term is 0.\n\nBut in (1,0,0), the linear term is 1, which is good.\n\nBut both give S=1.\n\nPerhaps the problem intends for us to set the variables to avoid the squaring and cubing penalties, so set y=0, z=0, x=1, so z=0, k=0.5.\n\nThen expected distance to 0.5 is 0.25.\n\nPerhaps that's it.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 1/4.\n\nI think I'll go with that.\n\nSo k = 0.5\n\nThen after 2010 moves, X is approximately uniform on [0,1], so E[|X - 0.5|] = 0.25\n\nSo answer is 0.25 or 1/4.\n\nSince the problem asks for exact value, likely 1/4.\n\nSo I'll box that.\n\nBut let's confirm the first part.\n\nPerhaps in the maximum, for the cubic term to be present, but the problem doesn't say.\n\nAnother way: perhaps \" the value of the variable with the cubic term\" means that we are to optimize with respect to z, but the sentence is \"where z is the value\", so it's the value in the optimal solution.\n\nPerhaps in the optimal solution for the maximum, z must be 0, because if z>0, then z^3 < z, so you could increase x by reducing z, but only if you can, but in the sum, if you reduce z, you can increase x, but then S = x + y^2 + z^3, if you decrease z by dz, you can increase x by dz, so dS = dx + 3z^2 dz = dz + 3z^2 (-dz) = dz(1 - 3z^2)  (since dz for z is negative, but let's see)\n\nIf you transfer from z to x, then delta z = -epsilon, delta x = epsilon, then delta S = epsilon + 3z^2 (-epsilon) + higher order = epsilon(1 - 3z^2)\n\nSo if 1 - 3z^2 >0, i.e., z < 1/sqrt(3) , then you can increase S by transferring from z to x.\n\nSimilarly, if you transfer from z to y, delta z = -epsilon, delta y = epsilon, delta S = 2y epsilon + 3z^2 (-epsilon) = epsilon(2y - 3z^2)\n\nSo if 2y > 3z^2, you can improve.\n\nBut in our case, at interior, it's not maximum.\n\nAt the point (0,0,1), if you try to transfer from z to x: delta z = -epsilon, delta x = epsilon, then new S = (0+epsilon) + 0 + (1-epsilon)^3 = epsilon + 1 -3epsilon +3epsilon^2 - epsilon^3 = 1 -2epsilon +3epsilon^2 - epsilon^3 <1 for small epsilon>0, so S decreases, so cannot improve.\n\nSimilarly, at (1,0,0), if you transfer from x to z: delta x = -epsilon, delta z = epsilon, S = (1-epsilon) + 0 + epsilon^3 = 1 -epsilon + epsilon^3 <1 for small epsilon>0, so cannot improve.\n\nAt (0,1,0), similar.\n\nSo all are local maxima.\n\nBut at (0,0,1), if you could, but you can't improve.\n\nSo all are valid.\n\nBut perhaps for the cubic term, they want z=1.\n\nI think the safe bet is to take k=0.5, as it's the expected position, and answer 0.25.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that in the maximum, z=0, because otherwise you have z^3 < z, but at z=1, z^3= z, so no issue.\n\nAt z=1, z^3=1= z, so no loss.\n\nAt z=0, same.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nI recall that in some problems, they ask for the maximum, and it's 1, and they take the configuration.\n\nPerhaps for this problem, since it's \"Indecisive Andy\", and he is at the midpoint, and the point is at k=0.5, so the start, and after moves, expected distance to start is 1/4.\n\nSo I think the answer is 1/4.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\",\n    \"answer\": \"0.25\"\n}",
