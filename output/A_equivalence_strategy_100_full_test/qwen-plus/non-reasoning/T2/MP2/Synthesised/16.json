  "math_problem": "How many ways can you mark 8 squares of an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard so that no two marked squares are in the same row or column, and none of the four corner squares is marked? (Rotations and reflections are considered different.) Instead of counting the total number of valid placements satisfying the row, column, and corner avoidance conditions, simply find $s = m - 4$, where $m$ is the number of columns available for the intermediate rows after assigning columns to the boundary rows under the given constraints. Sally the snail sits on the $3 \\times 24$ lattice of points $(i, j)$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq 3$ and $1 \\leq j \\leq 24$. She wants to visit every point in the lattice exactly once. In a move, Sally can move to a point in the lattice exactly one unit away. Given that Sally starts at $(s,1)$, compute the number of possible paths Sally can take.",
