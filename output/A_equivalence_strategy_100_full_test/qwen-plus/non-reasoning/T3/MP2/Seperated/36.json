Then the equation becomes:\\n$$\\ns(s - 1) = n - 1\\n\\\\Rightarrow n = s(s - 1) + 1 = s^2 - s + 1\\n$$\\n\\nSo for a given digit sum $ s $, we can compute $ n = s^2 - s + 1 $, and then check whether the actual digit sum of $ n $ is indeed $ s $.\\n\\nWe try small values of $ s $ starting from 1:\\n\\n- $ s = 1 $: $ n = 1^2 - 1 + 1 = 1 $, $ S(1) = 1 $ → valid.\\n\\nSo $ n = 1 $ satisfies the equation. Let's verify:\\n$ S(1) = 1 $, so left-hand side: $ 1(1 - 1) = 0 $, right-hand side: $ 1 - 1 = 0 $. ✓\\n\\nThus, the smallest such $ n $ is 1, and $ S(n) = 1 $, so $ k = S(n) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 $.\\n\\nBut wait — let's check if there could be a smaller $ n $? No, since $ n = 1 $ is the smallest positive integer. So it's correct.\\n\\nHowever, let's double-check higher $ s $ to ensure no smaller $ n $ appears (though unlikely):\\n\\nBut $ n = s^2 - s + 1 $ increases with $ s $, so $ s = 1 \\\\Rightarrow n = 1 $ is the smallest possible.\\n\\nSo $ k = 1 + 4 = 5 $.\\n\\nWait — is $ n = 1 $ really the only small solution? Let's test $ s = 2 $:\\n$ n = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3 $, $ S(3) = 3 \\\\ne 2 $ → invalid.\\n$ s = 3 $: $ n = 9 - 3 + 1 = 7 $, $ S(7) = 7 \\\\ne 3 $\\n$ s = 4 $: $ n = 16 - 4 + 1 = 13 $, $ S(13) = 1 + 3 = 4 $ → valid!\\n\\nWait! $ n = 13 $, $ S(13) = 4 $, so check:\\nLeft: $ 4*(4 - 1) = 12 $, Right: $ 13 - 1 = 12 $ → ✓\\n\\nSo $ n = 13 $ also works. But earlier $ n = 1 $ works too. Is $ n = 1 $ smaller? Yes.\\n\\nBut wait: $ s = 1 \\\\Rightarrow n = 1 $, which gives $ S(1) = 1 $, and equation holds.\\n\\nSo $ n = 1 $ is valid and smaller than 13.\\n\\nBut is $ S(1) = 1 $? Yes.\\n\\nSo smallest $ n $ is 1, $ S(n) = 1 $, $ k = 1 + 4 = 5 $.\\n\\nWait — but let's check $ s = 5 $: $ n = 25 - 5 + 1 = 21 $, $ S(21) = 2 + 1 = 3 \\\\ne 5 $\\n$ s = 6 $: $ n = 36 - 6 + 1 = 31 $, $ S(31) = 4 \\\\ne 6 $\\n$ s = 7 $: $ 49 - 7 + 1 = 43 $, $ S(43) = 7 $ → valid?\\nCheck: $ 7*6 = 42 $, $ n - 1 = 42 $ → $ n = 43 $ → yes!\\nSo $ n = 43 $, $ S(n) = 7 $, equation holds.\\nBut 43 > 1, so not smaller.\\n\\nSo far, $ n = 1 $ is the smallest.\\n\\nBut wait — is $ n = 1 $ really acceptable? $ S(1) = 1 $, so $ 1*(1 - 1) = 0 $, $ n - 1 = 0 $. Yes.\\n\\nSo $ S(n) = 1 $, $ k = 1 + 4 = 5 $.\\n\\nBut let's confirm if there's any $ n < 1 $? No, since $ n $ is positive integer.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 1: $ k = 5 $.\\n\\nWait — but let's recheck $ s = 1 \\\\Rightarrow n = 1 $: correct.\\n\\nIs there any other $ n $ between 1 and 13 that works? We can check manually?\\nTry $ n = 2 $: $ S(2) = 2 $, $ 2*1 = 2 $, $ n - 1 = 1 $ → 2 ≠ 1\\n$ n = 3 $: $ S=3 $, $ 3*2=6 $, $ n-1=2 $ → no\\n$ n = 4 $: $ S=4 $, $ 4*3=12 $, $ n-1=3 $ → no\\n...\\nOnly when $ n = s^2 - s + 1 $ and $ S(n) = s $, it works.\\nWe found $ s = 1 \\\\Rightarrow n = 1 $, valid.\\nSo smallest $ n $ is 1.\\nThus $ k = 1 + 4 = 5 $.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nPenta chooses 5 of the vertices of a unit cube. What is the maximum possible volume of the figure whose vertices are the 5 chosen points?\\n\\nThe figure formed by 5 points is a polyhedron. To maximize volume, we want the 5 points to be as spread out as possible in 3D space.\\n\\nA unit cube has side length 1, so its vertices are at coordinates $ (x,y,z) $ where each of $ x,y,z \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\} $.\\n\\nWe need to pick 5 vertices to form a polyhedron of maximum volume.\\n\\nNote: The convex hull of 5 points in a cube can be a pyramid or other polyhedron.\\n\\nTo maximize volume, likely the best is to take 4 coplanar points forming a face (area 1), and one point not on that plane, to form a pyramid.\\n\\nVolume of a pyramid: $ V = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times \\\\text{base area} \\\\times \\\\text{height} $\\n\\nIf base is a face of the cube (area 1), and apex is opposite vertex, height = 1, then volume = $ \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times 1 \\\\times 1 = \\\\frac{1}{3} $\\n\\nBut is this achievable? Only if the apex is directly above the base — but in a cube, if base is a face, the opposite face is parallel, but no single vertex is directly \\\"above\\\" the entire face unless it's aligned.\\n\\nActually, if we take a face (say, bottom face: z=0), and one vertex from top face (z=1), say (0,0,1), then the pyramid with base the bottom face and apex (0,0,1) — but (0,0,1) is only above (0,0,0), not the whole face.\\n\\nSo the height from apex to the base plane is 1 (since z-difference), and the base is planar, so volume is still $ \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times \\\\text{area} \\\\times \\\\text{perpendicular height} $, regardless of where the apex is, as long as we're measuring perpendicular distance to the plane.\\n\\nYes — volume of tetrahedron/pyramid depends only on base area and height (perpendicular).\\n\\nBut wait: a pyramid with quadrilateral base and apex not necessarily above center — the volume is still $ \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times \\\\text{base area} \\\\times \\\\text{height} $, provided the base is planar and height is perpendicular distance from apex to the plane.\\n\\nSo if we take any face (area 1), and an apex not on that plane (so from the opposite face), the perpendicular distance is 1, so volume = $ \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times 1 \\\\times 1 = \\\\frac{1}{3} $\\n\\nBut is this the maximum?\\n\\nCould we get a larger volume with a non-planar base? But the convex hull will have triangular or quadrilateral faces.\\n\\nAlternatively, consider taking 5 points that form a polyhedron with larger volume.\\n\\nAnother idea: take a regular tetrahedron — but in a cube, the largest tetrahedron has volume $ \\\\frac{1}{3} $? Wait.\\n\\nActually, a tetrahedron using 4 alternate vertices of the cube (e.g., all with even parity) has volume:\\nFor example, vertices: (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1)\\nVolume of tetrahedron with vertices A,B,C,D is:\\n$ V = \\\\frac{1}{6} | \\\\det(\\\\vec{AB}, \\\\vec{AC}, \\\\vec{AD}) | $\\nLet A = (0,0,0)\\nB = (1,1,0), C = (1,0,1), D = (0,1,1)\\nVectors:\\nAB = (1,1,0)\\nAC = (1,0,1)\\nAD = (0,1,1)\\nDet = determinant of matrix:\\n| 1 1 0 |\\n| 1 0 1 |\\n| 0 1 1 |\\n= 1*(0*1 - 1*1) - 1*(1*1 - 0*1) + 0*(1*1 - 0*0)\\n= 1*(-1) - 1*(1) + 0 = -1 -1 = -2 → abs value 2\\nSo volume = $ \\\\frac{1}{6} \\\\times 2 = \\\\frac{1}{3} $\\nSame as before.\\n\\nBut this is a tetrahedron (4 points). Now we have 5 points. Adding a fifth point may increase the convex hull volume.\\n\\nSuppose we take 5 points including this tetrahedron and one more. But the convex hull might become a polyhedron with more volume.\\n\\nWhat is the maximum volume convex hull of 5 vertices of a unit cube?\\n\\nKnown result or geometric intuition: the maximum volume occurs when the 5 points include a full face (4 points) and one opposite corner.\\n\\nBut let's calculate volume of pyramid with square base (face of cube) and apex at opposite vertex.\\n\\nSay base: z=0 face: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,0)\\nApex: (1,1,1)\\nThis point is above the corner (1,1,0), not the center.\\nBut the base is in plane z=0, apex at z=1, so perpendicular height is 1.\\nBase area = 1\\nVolume of pyramid = $ \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times \\\\text{base area} \\\\times \\\\text{height} = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times 1 \\\\times 1 = \\\\frac{1}{3} $\\n\\nBut is this correct for a non-right pyramid? Yes — the formula holds for any pyramid: $ \\\\frac{1}{3} B h $, where $ h $ is the perpendicular height from apex to the base plane.\\n\\nSo volume is $ \\\\frac{1}{3} $.\\n\\nCan we get more than $ \\\\frac{1}{3} $?\\n\\nSuppose we take 5 points not including a full face.\\n\\nAnother configuration: take two adjacent faces, but omit some points.\\n\\nOr consider a triangular bipyramid, but in cube.\\n\\nMaximum possible volume: the entire cube has volume 1, so less than that.\\n\\nBut perhaps we can get more than $ \\\\frac{1}{3} $.\\n\\nI recall that the maximum volume simplex (tetrahedron) in a cube is $ \\\\frac{1}{3} $, but with 5 points, the convex hull can be larger.\\n\\nWait — actually, a pyramid over a face gives $ \\\\frac{1}{3} $, but what if we take a different base?\\n\\nSuppose we take a base that is not a face, but a larger area? But in a unit cube, the largest planar set of 4 points is a face, area 1. Diagonals don't help.\\n\\nAlternatively, take 4 points that are not coplanar? Then we cannot form a pyramid with quadrilateral base.\\n\\nThe convex hull of 5 points could be a triangular bipyramid or a square pyramid.\\n\\nSquare pyramid max volume: $ \\\\frac{1}{3} $ as above.\\n\\nWhat about a triangular prism? But we have only 5 points, not 6.\\n\\nAnother idea: take 5 points such that their convex hull is a polyhedron with more volume.\\n\\nConsider taking four points of one face and one point of the opposite face, but not directly above — but height is still 1, base area 1, volume $ \\\\frac{1}{3} $.\\n\\nBut is there a way to get a larger base or larger height? Height maximum is 1 (distance between opposite faces).\\n\\nUnless the base is tilted, but then the perpendicular height from apex might be less.\\n\\nSuppose we take a different kind of pyramid: base is a triangle.\\n\\nFor example, take three points forming a face diagonal triangle.\\n\\nMax area triangle in cube: for example, three points like (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1) — area?\\nBut volume of pyramid would depend on base area and height.\\n\\nArea of a triangle: maximum in cube is $ \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} $? Wait, no.\\n\\nActually, the largest triangle in a unit cube is the one with three edges meeting at a vertex? No.\\n\\nKnown: the largest triangle by area in a unit cube has area $ \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\approx 0.866 $, but is that right?\\n\\nWait, consider three points: (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1)\\nVectors: AB = (1,1,0), AC = (1,0,1)\\nCross product: i(1*1 - 0*0) - j(1*1 - 0*1) + k(1*0 - 1*1) = i(1) - j(1) + k(-1) = (1,-1,-1)\\nMagnitude: $ \\\\sqrt{1+1+1} = \\\\sqrt{3} $\\nArea = $ \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sqrt{3} \\\\approx 0.866 $\\n\\nNow, place apex at another point, say (0,1,1), and form a pyramid with this triangular base.\\n\\nBut the apex must not be on the plane.\\n\\nFirst, find the plane of the base: points A=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,0), C=(1,0,1)\\nNormal vector is (1,-1,-1) as above.\\nPlane equation: 1(x-0) -1(y-0) -1(z-0) = 0 → x - y - z = 0\\n\\nNow, point (0,1,1): plug in: 0 -1 -1 = -2 ≠ 0, so not on plane.\\nDistance from (0,1,1) to plane $ x - y - z = 0 $:\\nFormula: $ |ax_0+by_0+cz_0+d| / \\\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2} $, here d=0, a=1,b=-1,c=-1\\n$ |1*0 + (-1)*1 + (-1)*1| / \\\\sqrt{1+1+1} = |-2| / \\\\sqrt{3} = 2/\\\\sqrt{3} $\\n\\nBut this is greater than 1? 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.154 > 1, but the cube has diameter sqrt(3)≈1.732, so possible.\\n\\nBut is this distance correct? The formula gives the perpendicular distance.\\n\\nNow, volume of pyramid = $ \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times \\\\text{base area} \\\\times \\\\text{height} = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\times \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{3}} = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\times \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{3}} = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times 1 = \\\\frac{1}{3} $\\n\\nAgain $ \\\\frac{1}{3} $.\\n\\nInteresting.\\n\\nAnother configuration: suppose we take the five points excluding one corner. But symmetric.\\n\\nI recall that the maximum volume convex hull of 5 vertices of a unit cube is $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $.\\n\\nHow?\\n\\nConsider taking all points except those on one edge? No.\\n\\nBetter: take a tetrahedron and add a point, but volume may not increase much.\\n\\nWait — consider taking four points of a face and the opposite vertex — we got $ \\\\frac{1}{3} $.\\n\\nBut what if we take a different set: suppose we take three points on bottom face and two on top.\\n\\nFor example, take a triangular prism missing one point? But only 5 points.\\n\\nAnother idea: the convex hull could be a polyhedron with two triangular faces and three quadrilaterals.\\n\\nBut let's search known results or think differently.\\n\\nMaximum volume: suppose we take the five points: all except two adjacent vertices.\\n\\nBut perhaps the maximum is achieved when the five points include a full space diagonal.\\n\\nI found online or recall that the maximum volume is $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $, achieved by taking, for example, the following five points:\\n(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,1)\\n\\nLet’s compute the convex hull volume of these five points.\\n\\nPoints:\\nA: (0,0,0)\\nB: (1,0,0)\\nC: (0,1,0)\\nD: (0,0,1)\\nE: (1,1,1)\\n\\nThis looks promising.\\n\\nThe convex hull is a polyhedron. We can divide it into tetrahedra.\\n\\nOne way: fix point A, and form tetrahedra with the faces not containing A.\\n\\nNote that points B,C,D,E are not coplanar.\\n\\nWe can split the polyhedron into two parts: for example, tetrahedron A-B-C-D and then the remaining part involving E.\\n\\nBut E is not connected directly.\\n\\nBetter: the convex hull of these points includes tetrahedra.\\n\\nNotice that the points form a kind of pyramid over quadrilateral B-C-E-D or something.\\n\\nList the faces.\\n\\nFrom geometry, this shape is a square pyramid? Let's see distances.\\n\\nAlternatively, use the convex hull volume formula for 5 points.\\n\\nWe can divide into three tetrahedra, for example:\\n\\nTetrahedron 1: A, B, C, E\\nTetrahedron 2: A, C, D, E\\nTetrahedron 3: A, B, D, E\\n\\nBut do they overlap? And do they cover the whole hull?\\n\\nNote that point E is connected to all, and A is common.\\n\\nBut the region near B-C-D might be missing or overlapping.\\n\\nBetter: the polyhedron has faces:\\n- Triangle A-B-C (bottom)\\n- Triangle A-B-D\\n- Triangle A-C-D\\n- Triangle B-C-E\\n- Triangle B-D-E\\n- Triangle C-D-E\\n- and quadrilateral B-C-E-D? Not sure.\\n\\nActually, plotting: A origin, B x-axis, C y-axis, D z-axis, E opposite corner.\\n\\nThen the convex hull should include:\\n- Tetrahedron A-B-C-D: but D is (0,0,1), so this is a tetrahedron in the corner.\\nBut E is (1,1,1), so it extends.\\n\\nActually, the convex hull is the set of all points, and it includes the tetrahedron A-B-C-E, etc.\\n\\nStandard result: the convex hull of these 5 points is a polyhedron called a 'triangular bipyramid' or more likely a 'square pyramid', but let's calculate volume by dividing into tetrahedra.\\n\\nDivide the polyhedron into three tetrahedra:\\n1. A, B, C, E\\n2. A, C, D, E\\n3. A, D, B, E\\n\\nBut this counts the interior multiple times? No, if they only share faces.\\n\\nDo these three tetrahedra fill the space without overlap?\\n\\nTetrahedron 1: A,B,C,E\\nTetrahedron 2: A,C,D,E\\nTetrahedron 3: A,D,B,E\\n\\nThey all share edge A-E.\\n\\nThe union: covers points from A to the faces.\\n\\nBut what about the region near B-C-D? For example, point (1,1,0) is not in any of these? But (1,1,0) is not one of our points, and may not be in the convex hull.\\n\\nOur points are only A,B,C,D,E.\\n\\nIs the point (1,1,0) in the convex hull? It would require combination, but let's see if it's needed.\\n\\nActually, the convex hull of A,B,C,D,E does not include (1,1,0) necessarily.\\n\\nNow, the three tetrahedra:\\n- T1: A,B,C,E\\n- T2: A,C,D,E\\n- T3: A,D,B,E\\n\\nTheir union includes all points, and they intersect only on shared faces (like triangle A,C,E for T1 and T2), so no volume overlap.\\n\\nDo they cover the entire convex hull? Consider a point inside, say the centroid of B,C,D,E — but B,C,D,E are not coplanar.\\n\\nNote that the convex hull should also include the tetrahedron B,C,D,E if it's part of it, but in this division, the region near B,C,D is covered by the bases.\\n\\nActually, the three tetrahedra together form a polyhedron with outer faces: B-C-E, C-D-E, D-B-E, and the three faces near A: A-B-C, A-C-D, A-D-B? But A-B-C is in T1, A-C-D in T2, A-D-B in T3.\\n\\nBut is triangle A-B-C part of the convex hull? Points A,B,C are on the boundary, and since D and E are above, likely yes.\\n\\nSimilarly, the face B-C-E: points B,C,E — are they coplanar with others? Probably a face.\\n\\nSo yes, this division seems to cover the convex hull without overlap.\\n\\nNow compute volume of each tetrahedron.\\n\\nVolume of tetrahedron with vertices P1,P2,P3,P4 is $ \\\\frac{1}{6} | \\\\det(\\\\vec{P1P2}, \\\\vec{P1P3}, \\\\vec{P1P4}) | $\\n\\nUse A = (0,0,0) as P1 for all.\\n\\nTetrahedron 1: A,B,C,E\\nVectors: AB = (1,0,0), AC = (0,1,0), AE = (1,1,1)\\nMatrix:\\n| 1 0 0 |\\n| 0 1 0 |\\n| 1 1 1 |\\nDet = 1*(1*1 - 0*1) - 0 + 0 = 1*1 = 1\\nVolume = $ \\\\frac{1}{6} |1| = \\\\frac{1}{6} $\\n\\nTetrahedron 2: A,C,D,E\\nVectors: AC = (0,1,0), AD = (0,0,1), AE = (1,1,1)\\nMatrix:\\n| 0 1 0 |\\n| 0 0 1 |\\n| 1 1 1 |\\nDet = 0*(0*1 - 1*1) -1*(0*1 - 1*1) + 0*(0*1 - 0*1) = 0 -1*(-1) + 0 = 1\\nVolume = $ \\\\frac{1}{6} $\\n\\nTetrahedron 3: A,D,B,E\\nVectors: AD = (0,0,1), AB = (1,0,0), AE = (1,1,1)\\nMatrix:\\n| 0 0 1 |\\n| 1 0 0 |\\n| 1 1 1 |\\nDet = 0*(0*1 - 0*1) -0*(1*1 - 0*1) +1*(1*1 - 0*1) = 0 - 0 + 1*(1) = 1\\nVolume = $ \\\\frac{1}{6} $\\n\\nTotal volume = $ \\\\frac{1}{6} + \\\\frac{1}{6} + \\\\frac{1}{6} = \\\\frac{1}{2} $\\n\\nOh! So volume is $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $.\\n\\nIs this larger than previous $ \\\\frac{1}{3} $? Yes, $ 0.5 > 0.333 $.\\n\\nAnd all points are vertices of the unit cube.\\n\\nCan we get larger? The cube has volume 1, so $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $ is half, plausible.\\n\\nIs there a configuration with volume larger than $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $? Probably not, as this uses points spread across the cube.\\n\\nAnother set: if we take five points including both ends of a space diagonal.\\n\\nIn this case, we have (0,0,0) and (1,1,1), and three adjacent ones.\\n\\nSymmetric.\\n\\nI believe $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $ is the maximum.\\n\\nTo confirm, the convex hull of any 5 vertices of a cube cannot exceed $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $, and this achieves it.\\n\\nSo maximum volume is $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $.\\n\\nTherefore, answer to Problem 2 is $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $.\\n\\nBut earlier I thought pyramid gave $ \\\\frac{1}{3} $, but this gives $ \\\\frac{1}{2} $, better.\\n\\nSo final answers:\\nProblem 1: k = 5\\nProblem 2: 1/2\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"5\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1/2\"\n}",
