We are to find $m = c + 288$, where $c$ comes from valid solutions derived using structural considerations modulo 3 and factorization.\\n\\nStep 1: Analyze modulo 3.\\n\\nSquares modulo 3 are:\\n- $0^2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{3}$\\n- $1^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{3}$\\n- $2^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{3}$\\n\\nSo squares mod 3 are either 0 or 1.\\n\\nNow, consider possible values of each term mod 3.\\n\\nLet’s analyze both sides modulo 3.\\n\\nLeft-hand side (LHS): $a^2 + b^2 + 16c^2$\\n\\nNote: $16 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{3}$, so $16c^2 \\\\equiv c^2 \\\\pmod{3}$\\n\\nThus,\\n$$\\n\\\\text{LHS} \\\\equiv a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\\\pmod{3}\\n$$\\n\\nRight-hand side (RHS): $9k^2 + 1$\\n\\nSince $9k^2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{3}$, we have:\\n$$\\n\\\\text{RHS} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{3}\\n$$\\n\\nSo we require:\\n$$\\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{3}\\n$$\\n\\nNow, $a$, $b$, $c$ are primes. So consider cases based on whether they are 3 or not.\\n\\n- If a prime $p \\\\neq 3$, then $p \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{3}$, so $p \\\\equiv \\\\pm1 \\\\pmod{3}$, hence $p^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{3}$\\n- If $p = 3$, then $p^2 = 9 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{3}$\\n\\nSo square of any prime modulo 3 is:\\n- 0 if the prime is 3\\n- 1 otherwise\\n\\nLet’s suppose how many of $a$, $b$, $c$ are equal to 3.\\n\\nLet $x = $ number of primes among $a,b,c$ that are not 3 → their squares contribute 1 each\\nLet $y = $ number equal to 3 → their squares contribute 0\\nThen total sum mod 3 is $x \\\\cdot 1 + y \\\\cdot 0 = x \\\\pmod{3}$\\n\\nWe need:\\n$$\\nx \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{3}\\n$$\\n\\nSo number of primes among $a,b,c$ that are **not** 3 must be $\\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{3}$, i.e., 1 or 4, but only 3 variables, so possible values: 1 or possibly 4? No — maximum is 3. So $x = 1$ or $x = 4$ invalid, so only $x=1$ or $x=1+3=4$ impossible. So $x=1$ or $x=1-3=-2$ no.\\n\\nWait: $x \\\\in \\\\{0,1,2,3\\\\}$, so $x \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{3} \\\\Rightarrow x = 1$\\n\\nSo exactly one of $a$, $b$, $c$ is **not** 3 → meaning two of them are 3?\\n\\nWait: $x$ = number **not equal** to 3 → contributes 1\\nWe need $x \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{3}$ → so $x = 1$ (since 4 > 3)\\n\\nSo exactly **one** of $a$, $b$, $c$ is **not** 3 → so two of them are 3.\\n\\nWait: that would mean two are equal to 3, one is different.\\nBut $x = $ number not equal to 3 → so $x = 1$ means only one of them is not 3 → so two are 3.\\nYes.\\n\\nSo two of $a$, $b$, $c$ are 3, one is a different prime.\\n\\nNow, which one?\\n\\nLet’s try possibilities.\\n\\nCase 1: $a = 3$, $b = 3$, $c \\\\neq 3$\\nThen $a^2 = 9$, $b^2 = 9$, $16c^2$\\nLHS = $9 + 9 + 16c^2 = 18 + 16c^2$\\nRHS = $9k^2 + 1$\\nSo:\\n$$\\n18 + 16c^2 = 9k^2 + 1 \\\\Rightarrow 16c^2 + 17 = 9k^2\\n$$\\nTry small primes for $c$: $c = 2,5,7,11,...$\\n$c=2$: $16*4 = 64$, $64+17=81$, $9k^2=81 \\\\Rightarrow k^2=9 \\\\Rightarrow k=3$ → works!\\nSo $c=2$, but wait: in this case $c \\\\neq 3$, yes, $c=2$ is allowed.\\nBut earlier we assumed $c \\\\neq 3$, and $c=2$ is prime.\\nSo check:\\n$a=3$, $b=3$, $c=2$\\nLHS: $9 + 9 + 16*4 = 18 + 64 = 82$\\nRHS: $9k^2 + 1 = 82 \\\\Rightarrow 9k^2 = 81 \\\\Rightarrow k^2=9 \\\\Rightarrow k=3$ → yes! Valid.\\n\\nNow, are there other cases?\\n\\nBut according to our mod 3 analysis, we must have exactly **one** of $a,b,c$ not equal to 3.\\nHere: $a=3$, $b=3$, $c=2 \\\\neq 3$ → so two are 3, one is not → $x=1$ → satisfies condition.\\n\\nNow check other configurations.\\n\\nCase 2: $a = 3$, $c = 3$, $b \\\\neq 3$\\nThen $a^2 = 9$, $16c^2 = 16*9 = 144$, $b^2$\\nLHS = $9 + b^2 + 144 = b^2 + 153$\\nSet equal to $9k^2 + 1$ → $b^2 + 153 = 9k^2 + 1 \\\\Rightarrow b^2 + 152 = 9k^2$\\nSo $9k^2 - b^2 = 152$\\n$(3k - b)(3k + b) = 152$\\nNow $b$ is prime not 3.\\nTry factoring 152:\\n152 = 1×152, 2×76, 4×38, 8×19\\nSet $3k - b = d$, $3k + b = 152/d$, $d < \\\\sqrt{152} \\\\approx 12.3$, so try small d.\\nd=1: then $3k - b =1$, $3k + b =152$ → add: 6k = 153 → k=25.5 → no\\nd=2: 3k-b=2, 3k+b=76 → add: 6k=78 → k=13 → then b=(76-2)/2? Wait: subtract: (3k+b)-(3k-b)=2b=74 → b=37 → prime! Yes.\\nSo b=37, k=13\\nCheck: $a=3$, $c=3$, $b=37$\\nLHS: $a^2 + b^2 + 16c^2 = 9 + 1369 + 16*9 = 9 + 1369 + 144 = 1522$\\nRHS: $9*(13)^2 +1 = 9*169 +1 = 1521 +1 = 1522$ → yes! Also valid.\\n\\nBut now: in this solution, $a=3$, $c=3$, $b=37 \\\\neq 3$ → again, two are 3, one is not → still satisfies mod 3 condition.\\n\\nSimilarly, Case 3: $b=3$, $c=3$, $a \\\\neq 3$ → symmetric to above, will give same type.\\n\\nBut problem says “find all” but then says “instead... find $m = c + 288$, where $c$ is the prime associated with the $16c^2$ term in the valid solution derived from structural consideration”\\n\\nWait: it says “the valid solution derived from the structural consideration of the equation modulo 3 and factorization.”\\n\\nPossibly implying there is a particular one they want, perhaps the smallest or simplest.\\n\\nIn first solution: $a=3$, $b=3$, $c=2$ → $c=2$\\nIn second: $a=3$, $c=3$, $b=37$ → $c=3$\\nThird case: $b=3$, $c=3$, $a=37$ → $c=3$\\n\\nSo possible $c$ values: 2 or 3\\n\\nBut the instruction says “the valid solution derived from...” — singular.\\n\\nPerhaps they mean the one where we use modulo 3 and then factorization to narrow down.\\n\\nBut both satisfy mod 3.\\n\\nWait: in the first solution, $c=2$, which is not 3, and it worked with small numbers.\\nBut let's see: in that solution, $c=2$, so $16c^2 = 16*4=64$\\nAnd we had $a=b=3$\\n\\nNow, is there a reason to prefer one over another?\\n\\nBut the problem says “find m = c + 288”, and if c=2, m=290; if c=3, m=291\\n\\nBut perhaps we missed something.\\n\\nWait: in the mod 3 analysis, we concluded that exactly one of $a,b,c$ is not 3 → so two are 3.\\nBut in the first solution: $a=3$, $b=3$, $c=2 \\\\neq 3$ → so two are 3, one (c) is not → okay.\\nSecond: $a=3$, $c=3$, $b=37 \\\\neq 3$ → two are 3, one (b) is not → okay.\\nSame for third.\\n\\nBut now, perhaps all are valid, but the problem wants “the” solution derived via structural consideration — maybe the minimal one?\\n\\nBut let's look back at the equation.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps consider modulo 4 or other moduli to restrict further.\\n\\nBut note: all odd primes are odd, so their squares ≡ 1 mod 4.\\n2 is even, 2²=4≡0 mod 4.\\n\\nBut let's see parity.\\n\\nLeft side: $a^2 + b^2 + 16c^2$\\n16c² is always divisible by 16, so ≡0 mod 16\\na² and b² depend.\\n\\nBut RHS: 9k² +1\\n\\nBut maybe too messy.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem implies that through modulo 3 and factorization, we can derive a specific solution.\\n\\nWait: in the first solution with c=2, we got k=3, very small.\\nIn others, k=13, larger.\\n\\nBut the problem says “the valid solution derived from structural consideration” — perhaps they mean the one where we assume c is small or something.\\n\\nBut let's reexamine the mod 3 logic.\\n\\nWe said: $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{3}$ because LHS ≡ a²+b²+c² mod 3, RHS ≡1 mod 3.\\n\\nBut wait: is that correct?\\n\\nWe had: $16c^2 \\\\equiv c^2 \\\\pmod{3}$ since 16≡1, yes.\\nSo LHS ≡ a² + b² + c² mod 3, yes.\\nRHS ≡1 mod 3, yes.\\nSo sum of three squares ≡1 mod 3.\\nEach square is 0 or 1 mod 3.\\nSum of three 0/1s ≡1 mod 3 → possibilities: one 1 and two 0s, or four 1s but only three terms → so only possibility: exactly one of the squares ≡1 mod 3, the other two ≡0.\\n\\nSquare ≡0 mod 3 iff the number is divisible by 3. Since a,b,c are primes, this means the prime is 3.\\nSo square ≡0 mod 3 iff prime =3\\nSquare ≡1 mod 3 iff prime ≠3\\n\\nTherefore, having the square ≡0 mod 3 means the prime is 3\\n≡1 means prime ≠3\\n\\nWe need sum ≡1 mod 3 → so number of primes ≠3 among a,b,c is exactly one (since each such contributes 1 to the sum)\\nSo exactly one of a,b,c is not 3 → the other two are 3.\\n\\nSo in all valid solutions, two of the primes are 3, one is a different prime.\\n\\nNow, which one is not 3? It could be a, b, or c.\\n\\nSo three cases:\\n\\nCase 1: a ≠3, b=3, c=3\\nThen equation:\\na² + 9 + 16*9 = 9k² +1 → a² + 9 + 144 = 9k² +1 → a² + 153 = 9k² +1 → 9k² - a² = 152 → (3k - a)(3k + a) = 152\\n\\nAs before, factor pairs of 152:\\n(1,152), (2,76), (4,38), (8,19)\\n\\nSet 3k - a = d, 3k + a = 152/d, d < sqrt(152)≈12.3\\n\\nTry d=1: 3k-a=1, 3k+a=152 → add: 6k=153 → k=25.5 → no\\nd=2: 3k-a=2, 3k+a=76 → add: 6k=78 → k=13 → a=(76-2)/2? Wait: subtract: (3k+a)-(3k-a)=2a=74 → a=37 → prime ≠3 → valid\\n\\nSo a=37, k=13\\n\\nSimilarly, Case 2: b ≠3, a=3, c=3 → same as above, symmetric: b=37, k=13\\n\\nCase 3: c ≠3, a=3, b=3\\nThen: 9 + 9 + 16c² = 9k² +1 → 18 + 16c² = 9k² +1 → 16c² +17 = 9k²\\nSo 9k² - 16c² = 17\\n(3k - 4c)(3k + 4c) = 17\\n17 is prime, so factor pairs: (1,17)\\nSet:\\n3k - 4c = 1\\n3k + 4c = 17\\nAdd: 6k = 18 → k=3\\nSubtract: 8c = 16 → c=2\\nc=2, which is prime ≠3 → valid\\n\\nAre there negative factors? 17 is positive, both factors should be positive since 3k+4c > |3k-4c|, so only (1,17)\\n(-1,-17) would give negative k or c, invalid\\nSo only solution in this case: c=2, k=3\\n\\nSo total valid solutions:\\n- (a,b,c,k) = (37,3,3,13), (3,37,3,13), (3,3,2,3)\\n\\nSo possible c values: in first two, c=3; in last, c=2\\n\\nNow, the problem says: \\\"find m = c + 288, where c is the prime associated with the 16c² term in the valid solution derived from the structural consideration of the equation modulo 3 and factorization.\\\"\\n\\nThe phrase \\\"the valid solution\\\" suggests one, but there are three mathematically valid.\\n\\nBut perhaps \\\"structural consideration\\\" refers to the process: we used mod 3 to deduce two of the primes are 3, and then factorization to solve the difference of squares.\\n\\nIn all cases, we did that.\\n\\nBut perhaps they expect the solution where c is not 3, because otherwise if c=3, then 16c²=144, and it's symmetric in a way.\\n\\nBut the term is specifically 16c², so c is distinguished.\\n\\nMoreover, in the answer, m = c + 288\\nIf c=2, m=290; if c=3, m=291\\n\\nBut perhaps there is another constraint.\\n\\nWait: in the solution where c=3, like (37,3,3,13), then c=3, which is allowed, but in that case, the prime c is 3, which was one of the two that are 3.\\nBut in the mod 3 analysis, when c=3, its square is 0 mod 3, so it contributes 0.\\nIn the case where c≠3, it contributes 1.\\n\\nBut in the sum a²+b²+c² ≡1 mod 3, we need exactly one of the three squares to be 1 mod 3, i.e., exactly one prime not equal to 3.\\nSo if c≠3, then c contributes 1, so a and b must both be 3 → which is the case (3,3,2)\\nIf c=3, then c contributes 0, so one of a or b must be ≠3, the other=3 → which is the other cases.\\n\\nAll are valid.\\n\\nBut perhaps the problem intends for us to find the solution where the coefficient 16c² suggests c might be small, or perhaps there's a unique solution where factorization gives integer.\\n\\nBut all do.\\n\\nPerhaps I need to see if there are more solutions.\\nFor example, in case c≠3, we had 9k² - 16c² =17, which factored as (3k-4c)(3k+4c)=17, prime, so only one solution: c=2\\nIn the other cases, (3k-a)(3k+a)=152, which has multiple factor pairs, but only d=2 gave integer k, a=37\\nd=4: 3k-a=4, 3k+a=38 → add: 6k=42 → k=7 → a=(38-4)/2=17? Wait: subtract: 2a=34 → a=17 → prime\\nWait! Did I miss this?\\n\\nEarlier I tried d=1,2,4,8\\nd=4: 3k-a=4, 3k+a=38 → add: 6k=42 → k=7 → then 2a = (3k+a) - (3k-a) = 38-4=34 → a=17\\na=17, prime ≠3\\nCheck: a=17, b=3, c=3\\nLHS: a² + b² +16c² = 289 + 9 + 16*9 = 289+9+144=442\\nRHS: 9k²+1=9*49 +1=441+1=442 → yes! Another solution.\\n\\nSimilarly, d=8: 3k-a=8, 3k+a=19 → add: 6k=27 → k=4.5 → no\\nSo for a≠3, b=c=3, we have two solutions: a=17,k=7 and a=37,k=13\\nSimilarly for b≠3, a=c=3: b=17,k=7 or b=37,k=13\\nAnd for c≠3, a=b=3: only c=2,k=3\\n\\nSo total solutions:\\n- (17,3,3,7), (37,3,3,13), (3,17,3,7), (3,37,3,13), (3,3,2,3)\\n\\nSo c can be 3 or 2\\nWhen c=3, in four solutions; when c=2, in one solution.\\n\\nBut the problem asks for \\\"the\\\" solution derived from structural consideration.\\n\\nPerhaps they mean the one where we consider the equation modulo 3 and then factorize, and perhaps the smallest solution.\\nThe smallest k is 3, with c=2\\nOr smallest primes: (3,3,2)\\n\\nMoreover, in this solution, c=2, which is the only even prime, and it appears in the 16c² term.\\n\\nAdditionally, 16c² suggests that if c is odd, 16c² is large, but here c=2 makes 16*4=64, manageable.\\n\\nBut why would they say \\\"the\\\" solution?\\n\\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the mod 3 analysis.\\n\\nWait: when c=2, which is not 3, so c²=4≡1 mod 3\\na=3, a²=9≡0\\nb=3, b²=9≡0\\nSum: 0+0+1=1≡1 mod 3, good.\\nRHS: 9*9 +1=81+1=82≡1 mod 3, good.\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nBut perhaps there is a constraint I missed: the problem says \\\"prime numbers a,b,c and positive integers k\\\", no restriction, so all are valid.\\n\\nBut then c can be 2 or 3, so m=290 or 291\\n\\nBut the problem likely expects one answer.\\n\\nPerhaps \\\"structural consideration\\\" refers to analyzing the equation as a whole.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps consider modulo 9 or higher.\\n\\nTry modulo 9.\\n\\nSquares mod 9: possible values 0,1,4,7 (since 0^2=0, 1^2=1, 2^2=4, 3^2=0, 4^2=7, 5^2=7, 6^2=0, 7^2=4, 8^2=1)\\nSo squares mod 9: 0,1,4,7\\n\\nLHS: a^2 + b^2 + 16c^2\\n16 mod 9 is 7, so 16c^2 ≡ 7c^2 mod 9\\nSo LHS ≡ a^2 + b^2 + 7c^2 mod 9\\n\\nRHS: 9k^2 +1 ≡ 1 mod 9\\n\\nSo we need:\\na^2 + b^2 + 7c^2 ≡ 1 mod 9\\n\\nNow, plug in the solutions.\\n\\nFirst, solution (a,b,c)=(3,3,2)\\n3^2=9≡0, 2^2=4\\nSo a^2≡0, b^2≡0, c^2≡4\\nSo 0 + 0 + 7*4 = 28 ≡ 1 mod 9? 28-3*9=28-27=1 → yes.\\n\\nSolution (17,3,3): a=17, 17^2=289, 289 /9: 9*32=288, so 289≡1, b^2=9≡0, c^2=9≡0\\nSo 1 + 0 + 7*0 =1 ≡1 → good.\\n\\nSimilarly (37,3,3): 37^2=1369, 1369 /9: 9*152=1368, so 1369≡1, same as above → 1+0+0=1 → good.\\n\\nAll work.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem intends for us to find the solution where c is minimized or something.\\n\\nBut let's read the problem again: \\\"find m = c + 288, where c is the prime associated with the 16c^2 term in the valid solution derived from the structural consideration of the equation modulo 3 and factorization.\\\"\\n\\nPerhaps \\\"structural consideration\\\" means that we notice that 16c^2 and 9k^2 suggest (4c)^2 and (3k)^2, so the equation is a^2 + b^2 + (4c)^2 = (3k)^2 +1\\nSo sum of three squares equals a square plus 1.\\n\\nIn number theory, sum of three squares rarely equals a square, but here it's off by 1.\\n\\nBut not sure.\\n\\nPerhaps for the factorization approach, when we have two variables, but here it's mixed.\\n\\nAnother thought: in the case where a and b are both 3, we get a simple equation in c and k: 16c^2 - 9k^2 = -17\\nWhich is a Pell-like equation, and we solved it with factoring, getting only c=2.\\nIn the other cases, when c=3, we have a^2 - 9k^2 = -152 or something, which has multiple solutions.\\nBut the problem mentions \\\"factorization\\\", which we used in all cases.\\n\\nPerhaps they consider the solution with smallest values.\\nIn (3,3,2,3), the values are smallest.\\nc=2 is smaller than c=3 in other solutions.\\n\\nMoreover, 288 is a large number, 288+2=290, 288+3=291, perhaps 290 is intended.\\n\\nPerhaps there is a constraint that c must be such that 16c^2 is considered, and c=2 makes it 64, while c=3 makes 144, but not helpful.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps in the mod 3 analysis, when we have a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ≡1 mod 3, and we need exactly one of a,b,c not 3.\\nBut in the term 16c^2, if c=3, then 16*9=144, and a or b is large, but if c≠3, then c=2 is the only even prime, and it works.\\n\\nBut still.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem is that for c=3, in the solutions, c is 3, but in those solutions, a or b is 17 or 37, which are not 3, but c is 3, so it's fine.\\n\\nI think the intended solution is the one with smallest numbers, (3,3,2,3), so c=2, m=2+288=290.\\n\\nMoreover, in many such problems, the trivial or smallest solution is expected.\\n\\nAlso, 288 is 12^2 * 2, but 288+2=290, perhaps meaningful.\\n\\nSo I'll go with c=2, m=290.\\n\\nProblem 2: Find the smallest n such that n! ends in 290 zeroes.\\n\\nThe number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 = 2*5, and since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, it's determined by the number of factors of 5 in n!.\\n\\nThe formula is:\\nz(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + floor(n/625) + ...\\n\\nWe need the smallest n such that z(n) = 290.\\n\\nWe can find n by trial and error or binary search.\\n\\nFirst, estimate n.\\n\\nz(n) ≈ n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + n/625 + ... = n/5 / (1 - 1/5) = (n/5)/(4/5) = n/4\\nMore precisely, the series sums to n/4, but since floor functions, a bit less.\\nSo n ≈ 4 * 290 = 1160\\n\\nCompute z(1160):\\nfloor(1160/5) = 232\\nfloor(1160/25) = floor(46.4) = 46\\nfloor(1160/125) = floor(9.28) = 9\\nfloor(1160/625) = floor(1.856) = 1\\nfloor(1160/3125) = 0\\nSum: 232+46=278, +9=287, +1=288\\n288 < 290\\n\\nNeed 290, so increase n.\\n\\nz(1160)=288\\nNeed 2 more.\\n\\nEach time n increases by 5, z(n) may increase by 1, but when n is multiple of 25, etc., it may increase more.\\n\\nTry n=1165\\nfloor(1165/5)=233\\nfloor(1165/25)=floor(46.6)=46\\nfloor(1165/125)=floor(9.32)=9\\nfloor(1165/625)=1\\nSum: 233+46=279, +9=288, +1=289\\nStill 289\\n\\nn=1170\\nfloor(1170/5)=234\\nfloor(1170/25)=floor(46.8)=46\\nfloor(1170/125)=floor(9.36)=9\\nfloor(1170/625)=1\\nSum: 234+46=280, +9=289, +1=290 → yes!\\n\\nIs this the smallest? Check n=1169\\nfloor(1169/5)=233 (since 1169/5=233.8, floor=233)\\nfloor(1169/25)=floor(46.76)=46\\nfloor(1169/125)=floor(9.352)=9\\nfloor(1169/625)=1\\nSum: 233+46=279, +9=288, +1=289 < 290\\nn=1170 gives 290\\n\\nBut is there a number between 1160 and 1170 that gives 290? n=1165 gave 289, n=1166: floor(1166/5)=233.2→233, same as 1165 until n=1170\\nn=1170 is divisible by 5, so floor(n/5) increases.\\n\\nAt n=1170, /5=234, previously 233 for n=1169\\nOthers: /25=1170/25=46.8→46, same as before\\n/125=9.36→9, same\\n/625=1.872→1, same\\nSo sum: 234+46+9+1=290\\n\\nn=1169: /5=233.8→233, /25=46.76→46, /125=9.352→9, /625=1.8704→1, sum=233+46+9+1=289\\n\\nSo indeed, z(1169)=289, z(1170)=290\\n\\nBut is there a smaller n than 1170 with z(n)=290?\\n\\nSuppose n=1170 is the first to reach 290, but let me check if at some point it jumps.\\n\\nFor example, when n is multiple of 125, etc., but 125*9=1125, 125*10=1250>1170\\n25*46=1150, 25*47=1175>1170\\n\\nFrom n=1150 to 1170\\nAt n=1150: floor(1150/5)=230, /25=46, /125=9.2→9, /625=1.84→1, sum=230+46+9+1=286\\nn=1155: /5=231, others same: 46,9,1 → sum=231+46+9+1=287\\nn=1160: 232+46+9+1=288\\nn=1165: 233+46+9+1=289\\nn=1170: 234+46+9+1=290\\n\\nNo skips, increases by 1 every 5 numbers, since no additional powers of 5 in between.\\n\\nSo smallest n is 1170.\\n\\nBut confirm: is there any n<1170 with z(n)>=290? From above, n=1169 gives 289<290, so no.\\n\\nThus, answer is 1170.\\n\\nNow back to Problem 1, I think c=2, m=290.\\n\\nSo answer_1: 290, answer_2: 1170\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"290\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"1170\"\n}",
