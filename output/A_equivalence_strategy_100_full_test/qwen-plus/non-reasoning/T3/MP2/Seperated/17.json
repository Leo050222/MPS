Then $ T $ ranges from 0 to 500. Let $ c_T $ be the number of 5-tuples $ (i_1, \\\\dots, i_5) $ with each $ i_j \\\\in [0,100] $ such that $ T = i_1 + \\\\cdots + i_5 $.

The generating function for one variable $ i_j $ is:\\n\\n$$\\nP(x) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{100} x^k = \\\\frac{1 - x^{101}}{1 - x}\\n$$\\n\\nSo the generating function for the sum $ T $ is $ P(x)^5 = \\\\left( \\\\frac{1 - x^{101}}{1 - x} \\\\right)^5 $\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$$\\nS = \\\\sum_{T=0}^{500} c_T F_T = [x^T]\\\\left( P(x)^5 \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty F_n x^n \\\\right) \\\\text{ summed over coefficients? }\\n$$\\n\\nActually, more precisely:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{T} c_T F_T = \\\\text{coefficient extraction not needed; instead, evaluate } \\\\sum_{T} c_T F_T = \\\\sum_{i_1,\\\\dots,i_5=0}^{100} F_{i_1+\\\\cdots+i_5}\\n$$\\n\\nThis can be evaluated using generating functions as:\\n\\n$$\\nS = \\\\sum_{i_1,\\\\dots,i_5=0}^{100} F_{s}, \\\\quad s = \\\\sum i_j\\n$$\\n\\nLet’s use the identity:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{k=0}^m F_k = F_{m+2} - 1\\n$$\\n\\nBut here we have a convolution.\\n\\nThere is a powerful technique using the fact that Fibonacci numbers satisfy linear recurrences, and sums over grid convolutions can be expressed via inclusion-exclusion or finite differences.\\n\\nAlternatively, recall an identity from combinatorics: for variables bounded between 0 and m, the sum $ \\\\sum_{i_1,\\\\dots,i_d=0}^m F_{i_1+\\\\cdots+i_d} $ can be written using the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the fact that the unrestricted sum is related to $ F_{d(m+1)+c} $, but with corrections.\\n\\nHowever, there's a known type of identity when you have sums of $ F_{\\\\sum i_j} $ over bounded indices. A key idea is to use the fact that the sum $ \\\\sum_{i=0}^m x^i = \\\\frac{1 - x^{m+1}}{1 - x} $, so the generating function for the sum $ S $ is:\\n\\n$$\\nG(x) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{1 - x^{101}}{1 - x} \\\\right)^5\\n$$\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$$\\nS = \\\\sum_{T} c_T F_T = \\\\text{coefficient-wise dot product with } F_T\\n$$\\n\\nBut we can use the generating function trick:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{T=0}^\\\\infty F_T x^T = \\\\frac{x}{1 - x - x^2}\\n$$\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{T} c_T F_T = \\\\text{the constant term or evaluation?

Without bounds, the number of solutions to $ i_1 + \\\\cdots + i_5 = T $ is infinite, but we are summing $ F_T $ times the number of representations.\\n\\nBut perhaps use generating functions and the identity:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty F_n x^n = \\\\frac{x}{1 - x - x^2}\\n$$\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{i_1,\\\\dots,i_5=0}^{100} F_{i_1+\\\\cdots+i_5} = \\\\left[ \\\\text{coefficient interpretation} \\\\right]\\n$$\\n\\nBut actually, we can write:\\n\\n$$\\nS = \\\\sum_{i_1=0}^{100} \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{i_5=0}^{100} F_{s} = \\\\sum_{s=0}^{500} F_s \\\\cdot N(s)\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $ N(s) $ is the number of integer solutions to $ i_1 + \\\\cdots + i_5 = s $, $ 0 \\\\leq i_j \\\\leq 100 $.\\n\\n$ N(s) $ can be computed via inclusion-exclusion:\\n\\nUnrestricted number of non-negative integer solutions to $ \\\\sum i_j = s $ is $ \\\\binom{s + 5 - 1}{5 - 1} = \\\\binom{s + 4}{4} $, but only for $ s \\\\geq 0 $.\\n\\nNow subtract the cases where one variable $ \\\\geq 101 $. Let $ A_j $ be the set where $ i_j \\\\geq 101 $. Then by inclusion-exclusion:\\n\\n$$\\nN(s) = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{5} (-1)^j \\\\binom{5}{j} \\\\binom{s - 101j + 4}{4}\\n$$\\n\\nwith the convention that $ \\\\binom{n}{4} = 0 $ if $ n < 4 $.\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\n$$\\nS = \\\\sum_{s=0}^{500} F_s \\\\sum_{j=0}^{5} (-1)^j \\\\binom{5}{j} \\\\binom{s - 101j + 4}{4}\\n= \\\\sum_{j=0}^{5} (-1)^j \\\\binom{5}{j} \\\\sum_{s} F_s \\\\binom{s - 101j + 4}{4}\\n$$\\n\\nNow interchange sums.\\n\\nBut this seems messy. However, notice the coefficients in the given expression: $ 1, -5, 10, -10, 5, -1 $ — these are exactly $ \\\\binom{5}{j} (-1)^j $ for $ j = 0 $ to $ 5 $.\\n\\nSo the right-hand side is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^j \\\\binom{5}{j} F_{n_j}\\n$$\\n\\nBut in our inclusion-exclusion above, we have:\\n\\n$$\\nS = \\\\sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^j \\\\binom{5}{j} \\\\sum_{s} F_s \\\\binom{s - 101j + 4}{4}\\n$$\\n\\nBut that still has an inner sum. However, perhaps the entire sum $ S $ simplifies to a linear combination of Fibonacci numbers at specific arguments.\\n\\nAlternatively, there is a known identity:\\n\\n> For $ m \\\\geq 0 $, $ k \\\\geq 1 $,\\n> $$\\n> \\\\sum_{a_1,\\\\dots,a_k=0}^m F_{a_1+\\\\cdots+a_k} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j \\\\binom{k}{j} F_{(m+1)(k-j) + 1}\\n> $$\\n\\nWait, let's test with small values.\\n\\nTry $ k=1, m=100 $:\\n\\nLeft: $ \\\\sum_{i=0}^{100} F_i = F_{102} - 1 $ (since $ \\\\sum_{i=0}^n F_i = F_{n+2} - 1 $)\\n\\nRight: $ \\\\sum_{j=0}^1 (-1)^j \\\\binom{1}{j} F_{(101)(1-j)+1} = j=0: F_{101+1}=F_{102}, j=1: -F_{1} = -1 $, so $ F_{102} - 1 $.

Not matching.\\n\\nWait, maybe different offset.\\n\\nAlternative idea: perhaps the formula is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{a_1,\\\\dots,a_k=0}^m F_{a_1+\\\\cdots+a_k} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j \\\\binom{k}{j} F_{(m+1)(k-j) + c}\\n$$\\n\\nFrom the k=1 case, we had $ F_{(m+1)(1) + 1} - F_{(m+1)(0)+1} = F_{m+2} - F_1 = F_{m+2} - 1 $, which matched $ \\\\sum_{i=0}^m F_i = F_{m+2} - 1 $. So for k=1, it worked with $ F_{(m+1)(k-j) + 1} $\\n\\nBut for k=2, m=1, we got 2 vs actual 3.\\n\\nWait, sum was 3, formula gave 2. Close.\\n\\nWait, $ F_{(m+1)(k-j) + 1} $: for m=1, m+1=2\\nj=0: F_{2*2 +1}? Wait no: (k-j)=2-0=2 → 2*2 +1? No, earlier I said (m+1)(k-j)+1 = 2*(2-j)+1\\nj=0: 2*2+1=5 → F5=5\\nj=1: 2*1+1=3 → F3=2\\nj=2: 2*0+1=1 → F1=1\\nSo 1*5 -2*2 +1*1 = 5-4+1=2\\nBut actual sum is 3.\\n\\nWhat is $ \\\\sum F_{i+j} $ for i,j=0,1:\\ni+j: 0,1,1,2 → F0=0, F1=1, F1=1, F2=1 → sum=3\\n\\nBut F_{s} sum is 3.\\n\\nIs there a shift?\\n\\nMaybe it's $ F_{(m+1)(k-j)} $?

Matches.\\n\\nSo try:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{a_1,\\\\dots,a_k=0}^m F_{a_1+\\\\cdots+a_k} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j \\\\binom{k}{j} F_{(m+1)(k-j) + 2}\\n$$\\n\\nCheck k=1, m=100:\\nRHS: j=0: F_{101*1 +2}=F_{103}, j=1: -F_{0+2}= -F_2 = -1 → F_{103} - 1\\nBut actual sum $ \\\\sum_{i=0}^{100} F_i = F_{102} - 1 $. Not matching (F103 vs F102).\\n\\nNot good.\\n\\nWait, for k=2,m=1 we need F_{something} giving 3.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps the argument is $ (m+1)j $? No.\\n\\nBack to inclusion-exclusion.\\n\\nThe standard way to compute $ \\\\sum_{i_j=0}^m F_{\\\\sum i_j} $ is to use the fact that the sum over the hypercube can be written using the discrete convolution and generating functions.\\n\\nLet $ f(x) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^m x^k = \\\\frac{1 - x^{m+1}}{1 - x} $\\n\\nThen the generating function for the sum $ \\\\sum_{i_j} x^{\\\\sum i_j} $ is $ f(x)^k $\\n\\nThen $ \\\\sum_{i_1,\\\\dots,i_k=0}^m F_{\\\\sum i_j} = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{k m} F_n \\\\cdot [x^n] f(x)^k $\\n\\nBut we want $ \\\\sum_n F_n c_n = \\\\sum_n c_n F_n $\\n\\nUsing generating functions, this is like evaluating a Hadamard product, but there's a trick:\\n\\nConsider $ \\\\sum_n F_n y^n = \\\\frac{y}{1 - y - y^2} $\\n\\nBut we have $ \\\\sum_n c_n F_n = \\\\sum_n ([x^n] f(x)^k) F_n $\\n\\nThis is equal to the constant term or use integral, but alternatively, in practice, for such problems, the sum evaluates to:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j \\\\binom{k}{j} F_{(m+1)j + r}\\n$$\\n\\nBut from the coefficient pattern 1,-5,10,-10,5,-1 = binomial coefficients of (1-1)^5, so likely:\\n\\n$$\\nS = \\\\sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^j \\\\binom{5}{j} F_{a_j}\\n$$\\n\\nfor some arithmetic sequence in j.\\n\\nAssume $ a_j = A - B j $\\n\\nIn many such inclusion-exclusion identities, the argument is linear in j.\\n\\nSuppose $ S = \\\\sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^j \\\\binom{5}{j} F_{C - D j} $\\n\\nFrom symmetry or standard results, perhaps $ C = 5\\\\times101 = 505 $, and D=101?\\n\\nTry: $ F_{505} - 5 F_{404} + 10 F_{303} - 10 F_{202} + 5 F_{101} - F_{0} $\\n\\nNote: F0=0, so last term is 0.\\n\\nBut in the problem, all ni are positive integers, and the combination is:\\nF_{n1} -5F_{n2} +10F_{n3} -10F_{n4} +5F_{n5} -F_{n6}\\n\\nSo likely:\\nn1 = 505, n2=404, n3=303, n4=202, n5=101, n6=0 — but n6 must be positive, and F0 is used, but n6 should be positive.\\n\\nUnless they define n6 such that F_{n6} corresponds to F_0, but n6 must be positive. Contradiction.\\n\\nPerhaps shifted.\\n\\nAnother possibility: the general formula is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{i_1,\\\\dots,i_k=0}^m F_{i_1+\\\\cdots+i_k} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j \\\\binom{k}{j} F_{(k-j)(m+1) + 1}\\n$$\\n\\nTest k=2, m=1:\\nj=0: F_{2*2 +1}=F5=5\\nj=1: -2*F_{1*2+1}= -2*F3= -4\\nj=2: F_{0+1}=F1=1\\nSum: 5-4+1=2, but should be 3. No.\\n\\nTry +2: F_{(k-j)(m+1)+2}\\nj=0: F_{4+2}=F6=8\\nj=1: -2*F_{2+2}= -2*F4= -6\\nj=2: F_{0+2}=F2=1 → 8-6+1=3. Yes!\\n\\nTest k=1, m=100:\\nSum_{i=0}^{100} F_i = F_{102} - 1\\nFormula: j=0: F_{1*101 +2}=F_{103}, j=1: -F_{0+2}= -F2= -1 → F_{103}-1\\nBut should be F_{102}-1. Not match.\\n\\nOff by one.\\n\\nWait, what if it's F_{(k-j)(m+1)} ?\\nk=2,m=1: j=0: F_{2*2}=F4=3, j=1: -2*F_{2}= -2, j=2: F0=0 → 3-2=1≠3\\nNo.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps the sum is related to F_{k(m+1)} minus corrections.\\n\\nI recall that in some olympiad problems, the sum \\\\sum_{i=0}^n \\\\sum_{j=0}^n F_{i+j} = something.\\n\\nLet me compute small case: k=2, m=1:\\nAs above, sum = 3.\\n\\nList: (0,0): F0=0, (0,1):F1=1, (1,0):F1=1, (1,1):F2=1 → sum=3\\n\\nNow, what is F_{a} -2F_{b} + F_{c} =3?\\nSuppose a=4, b=2, c=0: F4=3, F2=1, F0=0 → 3 -2*1 +0=1\\na=5,b=3,c=1: 5-2*2+1=5-4+1=2\\na=6,b=4,c=2: 8-2*3+1=8-6+1=3. Yes!\\nSo F6 -2F4 + F2 = 8 - 6 + 1 = 3.\\nAnd 6=2*(1+1)*2? 2*2=4, no.\\n6 = 2*(m+1) +2? m=1, 2*2+2=6, yes.\\n4 = 2*(m+1)? 4, yes.\\n2 = 2*(m+1)-2? Or 2 = (m+1)*1 +1? Not clear.\\n\\nNote: 6,4,2 — decreases by 2.\\nFor k=2, m=1, we have F_{6} - 2F_{4} + F_{2}\\n6 = 3*2, 4=2*2, 2=1*2, so multiples of 2=m+1.\\nSpecifically: F_{3*2} -2F_{2*2} + F_{1*2} = F_{3(m+1)} -2F_{2(m+1)} + F_{1(m+1)}\\nBut 3,2,1 = k, k-1, k-2? k=2, so 3 is k+1?\\nIndices: j=0: coefficient (+1) F_{3(m+1)}, j=1: -2 F_{2(m+1)}, j=2: +1 F_{1(m+1)}\\nBut 3,2,1 = (k+1-j)(m+1)? For j=0: (3)(2)=6, j=1: (2)(2)=4, j=2: (1)(2)=2. Yes! And k+1=3.\\nSo general formula might be:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{i_1,\\\\dots,i_k=0}^m F_{i_1+\\\\cdots+i_k} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j \\\\binom{k}{j} F_{(k+1-j)(m+1)}\\n$$\\n\\nTest for k=1, m=100:\\nSum = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{100} F_i = F_{102} - 1\\nFormula: j=0: F_{2*101} = F_{202}, j=1: -F_{1*101} = -F_{101}\\nSo F_{202} - F_{101}\\nBut F_{202} - F_{101} is much larger than F_{102}-1. Not close.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nFor k=2, we had sum over two indices, and got F_{3*2} -2F_{2*2} + F_{1*2} = F_6 -2F_4 + F_2\\nBut 3,2,1 are not k-j, but rather (k+1-j)? k=2, j=0:3, j=1:2, j=2:1, yes k+1-j.\\nBut for k=1, it would be j=0: F_{2(m+1)}, j=1: -F_{1(m+1)} = F_{202} - F_{101}, but should be F_{102}-1.\\n\\nNot matching.\\n\\nPerhaps it's F_{(k-j)(m+1) + c}\\nFor k=2,m=1: we need F_a -2F_b + F_c =3\\nWe had F6-2F4+F2=3, and 6=2*2 +2, 4=2*2, 2=2*1, not consistent.\\n6= (2+1)*(1+1) =3*2=6, 4=2*2, 2=1*2, so multipliers 3,2,1 as before.\\n\\nAnother thought: in the sum for k indices from 0 to m, the maximum sum is km, minimum 0.\\nThe number of terms is (m+1)^k.\\n\\nBut back to the original problem: k=5, m=100.\\nThe coefficient pattern 1,-5,10,-10,5,-1 suggests it's binomial coefficients for (1-1)^5, so likely the arguments are arithmetic.\\n\\nAssume that the right-hand side is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^j \\\\binom{5}{j} F_{a - bj}\\n$$\\n\\nFrom the symmetry, probably a = 5*101 = 505, b=101, so:\\nF_{505} -5F_{404} +10F_{303} -10F_{202} +5F_{101} -F_{0}\\n\\nF0=0, so the last term is 0, but in the problem, it's -F_{n6} with n6 positive, so perhaps it's -F_{0} but they allow n6=0? But the problem says positive integers.\\n\\nUnless the indexing is different.\\n\\nPerhaps it's F_{506} -5F_{405} + ... but then n3=304, etc.\\n\\nBut let's calculate what n3 would be. In the combination, the coefficient +10 is for F_{n3}, and it's the third term, so likely corresponding to j=2 in the sum, since (-1)^2 binom(5,2)=10.\\n\\nSo if the argument is a - b*j, for j=2, n3 = a - 2b.\\n\\nIf a = 5*101 = 505, b=101, then n3 = 505 - 202 = 303.\\n\\nThen k = n3 - 299 = 303 - 299 = 4.\\n\\nIs this correct?\\n\\nLet me verify with a smaller case.\\n\\nTake k=2, m=1: sum = 3, as above.\\nAccording to this logic, sum_{i,j=0}^1 F_{i+j} = F_{2*2} -2F_{1*2} + F_{0*2} wait no.\\nGeneralizing: for k indices, m, sum = sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j binom(k,j) F_{(k-j)*(m+1)} ?\\nFor k=2,m=1: F_{2*2} -2F_{1*2} + F_{0*2} = F4 -2F2 + F0 = 3 -2*1 +0 =1 ≠3.\\nNo.\\n\\n sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j binom(k,j) F_{(k-j)*(m+1) + c}\\n\\nOr perhaps F_{(m+1)(k-j) + d}\\n\\nEarlier for k=2,m=1, we found that F6 -2F4 + F2 =3, and 6=3*2, 4=2*2, 2=1*2, so (3,2,1)*(m+1)\\n3= k+1, 2=k, 1=k-1? Not symmetric.\\n\\nNotice that 3,2,1 for j=0,1,2, so (k+1-j)*(m+1)\\nFor k=2, j=0: (3)*2=6, j=1:2*2=4, j=2:1*2=2.\\nSo F_{(k+1-j)(m+1)}\\n\\nFor k=5, m=100, m+1=101, so the sum would be:\\n\\n\\\\sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^j \\\\binom{5}{j} F_{(6-j)*101} = F_{606} -5F_{505} +10F_{404} -10F_{303} +5F_{202} -F_{101}\\n\\nBut in the problem, the first term is F_{n1} with coefficient +1, then -5F_{n2}, etc.\\nHere, it's F_{606} -5F_{505} +10F_{404} -10F_{303} +5F_{202} -F_{101}\\nSo n1=606, n2=505, n3=404, n4=303, n5=202, n6=101\\nThen the coefficient of F_{n3} is +10, so n3=404\\nThen k = n3 - 299 = 404 - 299 = 105\\n\\nBut is this correct?\\n\\nTest with k=2, m=1:\\nFormula gives: sum_{j=0}^2 (-1)^j binom(2,j) F_{(3-j)*2} = j=0: F6=8, j=1: -2*F4= -6, j=2: F2=1, sum=8-6+1=3. Correct!\\n\\nTest with k=1, m=100:\\nSum_{i=0}^{100} F_i = F_{102} - 1\\nFormula: j=0: F_{2*101} = F_{202}, j=1: -F_{1*101} = -F_{101}\\nSo F_{202} - F_{101}\\nBut should be F_{102} - 1. Is F_{202} - F_{101} = F_{102} - 1? No, left side is huge.\\nContradiction.\\n\\nFor k=1, the sum is over one index, so sum_{i=0}^{100} F_i\\nAccording to the formula with k=1: sum_{j=0}^1 (-1)^j binom(1,j) F_{(2-j)(m+1)} = j=0: F_{2*101}=F_{202}, j=1: -F_{1*101}= -F_{101}\\nBut actual sum is sum_{i=0}^{100} F_i = F_{102} - 1\\nClearly F_{202} - F_{101} >> F_{102} - 1, so not equal.\\n\\nBut for k=2 it worked, for k=1 not.\\n\\nWhat's the difference?\\n\\nFor k=1, the sum is sum_{i=0}^m F_i, which is not of the form sum F_{sum of k variables} in the same way? No, it is, with one variable.\\n\\nUnless the formula is different.\\n\\nFor k=2, we have sum over i,j of F_{i+j}, which is correct.\\n\\nPerhaps the formula is for the sum of F_{s} where s is the sum, but with a different offset.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps it's F_{(m+1)j + c} with j being the inclusion-exclusion index.\\n\\nAfter research in memory, I recall that in some problems, the sum \\\\sum_{i=0}^a \\\\sum_{j=0}^b F_{i+j} = F_{a+b+2} - F_{a+2} - F_{b+2} + F_2 or something.\\n\\nLet's compute sum_{i=0}^a sum_{j=0}^b F_{i+j}\\nLet S = sum_{i=0}^a sum_{j=0}^b F_{i+j} = sum_{k=0}^{a+b} F_k * min(k+1, a+1, b+1, a+b-k+1) etc, complicated.\\n\\nNote that sum_{j=0}^b F_{i+j} = F_{i+b+2} - F_{i+1} , because sum_{j=0}^b F_{i+j} = sum_{m=i}^{i+b} F_m = (F_{i+b+2} - F_{i+2}) - (F_{i+1} - F_{1}) wait.\\nStandard: sum_{m=r}^{s} F_m = F_{s+2} - F_{r+1}\\nBecause sum_{m=0}^{s} F_m = F_{s+2} - 1, so sum_{m=r}^{s} = (F_{s+2}-1) - (F_{r+1}-1) = F_{s+2} - F_{r+1}\\nYes.\\nSo sum_{j=0}^b F_{i+j} = sum_{m=i}^{i+b} F_m = F_{i+b+2} - F_{i+1}\\nThen S = sum_{i=0}^a [F_{i+b+2} - F_{i+1}] = sum_{i=0}^a F_{i+b+2} - sum_{i=0}^a F_{i+1} = sum_{k=b+2}^{a+b+2} F_k - sum_{k=1}^{a+1} F_k\\n = [F_{a+b+4} - F_{b+3}] - [F_{a+3} - F_{2}] = F_{a+b+4} - F_{b+3} - F_{a+3} + F_2\\nSince F2=1.\\nFor a=b=1: S = F_{1+1+4} - F_{1+3} - F_{1+3} +1 = F6 - F4 - F4 +1 = 8 - 3 -3 +1 = 3, which matches our earlier calculation. Good.\\nSo for two variables, sum_{i=0}^a sum_{j=0}^b F_{i+j} = F_{a+b+4} - F_{a+3} - F_{b+3} + F_2\\nBut in our case, a=b=100, and also it's symmetric, but for identical bounds.\\nIn our problem, all limits are 100, so a=b=c=d=e=100.\\nFor five variables, it would be very complicated.\\nBut in the problem, the right-hand side has only six terms, while for five variables, inclusion-exclusion might give more, but with binomial coefficients, it might collapse.\\n\\nBack to the coefficient pattern: 1,-5,10,-10,5,-1, which is exactly the binomial expansion of (1-1)^5, so likely the sum is \\\\sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^j \\\\binom{5}{j} F_{c_j} for some c_j.\\nGiven the symmetry, probably c_j = A - j*B.\\nMoreover, when j=0, it's the sum without any restriction, but with no upper bound, the sum diverges, so must be that c_j is linear in j.\\n\\nFrom the successful test with k=2, m=1: we had sum = F_{6} -2F_{4} + F_{2} = F_{3*2} -2F_{2*2} + F_{1*2}\\nAnd 3,2,1 = (k+1), k, (k-1) for j=0,1,2, but k=2, so (3,2,1) = (k+1-j+1)? No.\\nFor j=0: multiplier 3 = k+1, j=1: multiplier 2 = k, j=2: multiplier 1 = k-1, so multiplier = k+1 - j\\nFor k=2, multiplier = 3-j\\nSo c_j = (3-j) * (m+1) = (k+1-j)(m+1)\\nFor k=5, m=100, m+1=101, so c_j = (6-j)*101\\nSo the sum is \\\\sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^j \\\\binom{5}{j} F_{(6-j)*101}\\n = F_{606} -5F_{505} +10F_{404} -10F_{303} +5F_{202} -F_{101}\\nNow, compare to the given expression: F_{n1} -5F_{n2} +10F_{n3} -10F_{n4} +5F_{n5} -F_{n6}\\nSo n1=606, n2=505, n3=404, n4=303, n5=202, n6=101\\nAll positive integers, good.\\nThe coefficient of F_{n3} is +10, so n3=404\\nThen k = n3 - 299 = 404 - 299 = 105\\nBut earlier for k=1, it didn't work, but for k=1, if we apply the same formula: sum_{i=0}^m F_i = \\\\sum_{j=0}^1 (-1)^j \\\\binom{1}{j} F_{(2-j)(m+1)} = F_{2(m+1)} - F_{m+1}\\nFor m=100, F_{202} - F_{101}\\nBut actual sum is sum_{i=0}^{100} F_i = F_{102} - 1\\nAnd F_{202} - F_{101} is not equal to F_{102} - 1, so the formula is incorrect for k=1.\\nHowever, in our case k=5, and the formula worked for k=2, so perhaps it's only for k>=2 or specifically for the sum of F_{sum} with multiple indices.\\nFor k=1, the sum is sum_{i=0}^m F_i, which is different from sum_{i=0}^m F_{i} with i being the sum, but it is the same.\\nUnless the formula is different.\\nPerhaps for the sum over k indices, it's sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j \\\\binom{k}{j} F_{(m+1)(k-j) + k}\\nFor k=2, m=1: (m+1)(k-j) + k = 2*(2-j) +2 = 4 -2j +2 = 6-2j\\nj=0: F6=8, j=1: -2*F4= -6, j=2: F2=1, sum=3, good.\\nFor k=1, m=100: (101)(1-j) +1, j=0: F_{101*1 +1}=F_{102}, j=1: -F_{0+1}= -F1= -1, so F_{102} -1, which matches the actual sum! Perfect.\\nSo the general formula is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{i_1,\\\\dots,i_k=0}^m F_{i_1+\\\\cdots+i_k} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j \\\\binom{k}{j} F_{(m+1)(k-j) + k}\\n$$\\n\\nFor k=5, m=100, m+1=101, so\\n\\nS = \\\\sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^j \\\\binom{5}{j} F_{101(5-j) + 5} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^j \\\\binom{5}{j} F_{505 - 101j + 5} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^5 (-1)^j \\\\binom{5}{j} F_{510 - 101j}\\n\\nCompute the arguments:\\nj=0: F_{510}\\nj=1: F_{510-101}=F_{409}\\nj=2: F_{510-202}=F_{308}\\nj=3: F_{510-303}=F_{207}\\nj=4: F_{510-404}=F_{106}\\nj=5: F_{510-505}=F_{5}\\n\\nSo S = F_{510} -5F_{409} +10F_{308} -10F_{207} +5F_{106} -F_{5}\\n\\nCompare to given: F_{n1} -5F_{n2} +10F_{n3} -10F_{n4} +5F_{n5} -F_{n6}\\nSo n1=510, n2=409, n3=308, n4=207, n5=106, n6=5\\nAll positive integers.\\nThe coefficient of F_{n3} is +10, so n3=308\\nThen k = n3 - 299 = 308 - 299 = 9\\n\\nNow, is this correct? We verified for k=1 and k=2, so likely yes.\\n\\nFor k=2, m=1: formula gives F_{2*2 +2} -2F_{2*1 +2} + F_{2*0 +2} wait no.\\nFrom above: F_{(m+1)(k-j) + k} = for m=1,k=2: (2)(2-j) +2 = 4 -2j +2 = 6-2j\\nj=0: F6, j=1: -2F4, j=2: F2, sum=8-6+1=3, correct.\\nFor k=1,m=100: F_{101*(1-j)+1}, j=0: F_{101+1}=F_{102}, j=1: -F_{0+1}= -F1= -1, sum=F_{102}-1, correct.\\nSo the formula is solid.\\n\\nTherefore for k=5, m=100, n3=308, k=n3-299=308-299=9.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nFind the maximum possible value of \\\\sin \\\\left( \\\\tan^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{9}\\\\right) - \\\\tan^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{16}\\\\right) \\\\right) for x > 0.\\n\\nLet \\\\alpha = \\\\tan^{-1}(x/9), \\\\beta = \\\\tan^{-1}(x/16), so we want \\\\sin(\\\\alpha - \\\\beta).\\n\\n\\\\sin(\\\\alpha - \\\\beta) = \\\\sin\\\\alpha \\\\cos\\\\beta - \\\\cos\\\\alpha \\\\sin\\\\beta\\n\\nNow, \\\\sin\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{x/9}{\\\\sqrt{1 + (x/9)^2}} = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 81}}\\n\\\\cos\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 + (x/9)^2}} = \\\\frac{9}{\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 81}}\\nSimilarly, \\\\sin\\\\beta = \\\\frac{x/16}{\\\\sqrt{1 + (x/16)^2}} = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 256}}\\n\\\\cos\\\\beta = \\\\frac{16}{\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 256}}\\n\\nSo \\\\sin(\\\\alpha - \\\\beta) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{x}{\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 81}} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{16}{\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 256}} \\\\right) - \\\\left( \\\\frac{9}{\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 81}} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{x}{\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 256}} \\\\right)\\n= \\\\frac{16x - 9x}{\\\\sqrt{(x^2 + 81)(x^2 + 256)}} = \\\\frac{7x}{\\\\sqrt{(x^2 + 81)(x^2 + 256)}}\\n\\nLet f(x) = \\\\frac{7x}{\\\\sqrt{(x^2 + 81)(x^2 + 256)}} for x > 0.\\n\\nTo maximize f(x), we can minimize the denominator over numerator, or maximize f(x)^2 to eliminate the square root.\\n\\nLet g(x) = [f(x)]^2 = \\\\frac{49x^2}{(x^2 + 81)(x^2 + 256)}\\n\\nLet u = x^2 > 0, then h(u) = \\\\frac{49u}{(u + 81)(u + 256)}\\n\\nMaximize h(u) for u > 0.\\n\\nTake derivative: h'(u) = 49 \\\\frac{ (1)(u+81)(u+256) - u [ (u+256) + (u+81) ] }{[(u+81)(u+256)]^2} = 49 \\\\frac{ (u+81)(u+256) - u(2u + 337) }{denom}\\n\\nNumerator: (u^2 + 256u + 81u + 81*256) - (2u^2 + 337u) = u^2 + 337u + 81*256 - 2u^2 - 337u = -u^2 + 81*256\\n\\nSet to zero: -u^2 + 81*256 = 0 => u^2 = 81*256 => u = 9*16 = 144 (since u>0)\\n\\nSecond derivative or check: at u=144, h(u) = 49*144 / (144+81)(144+256) = 49*144 / (225)(400)\\n\\nCompute: 225=15^2, 400=20^2, 144=12^2\\nh(u) = 49 * 144 / (225 * 400) = (49 / 400) * (144 / 225) = (49 / 400) * (16 / 25) since 144/9=16, 225/9=25? 144÷9=16, 225÷9=25, yes.\\n144/225 = 16/25? 144÷9=16, 225÷9=25, yes.\\nSo h(u) = 49 * (16/25) / 400 = wait no:\\nh(u) = 49 * 144 / (225 * 400) = 49 * (144 / 225) / 400 = 49 * (16/25) / 400 = 49 * 16 / (25 * 400)\\n= (49 * 16) / (10000)\\nSince 25*400=10000\\n49*16=784\\nSo h(u)=784 / 10000 = 0.0784\\nThen f(x) = sqrt(h(u)) = sqrt(784 / 10000) = 28 / 100 = 0.28\\nBut let's keep exact.\\nf(x) = sqrt( h(u) ) = sqrt( 49 * 144 / (225 * 400) ) = (7 * 12) / (15 * 20) = 84 / 300 = 28 / 100 = 7/25\\nCompute:\\nsqrt(49 * 144 / (225 * 400)) = (7 * 12) / (15 * 20) = 84 / 300\\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 12: 84÷12=7, 300÷12=25? 12*25=300, 12*7=84, yes, so 7/25.\\nSo maximum is 7/25.\\nAs x->0+, f(x)->0, as x->infty, f(x) ~ 7x / (x * x) = 7/x ->0, so maximum at u=144.\\nThus the maximum value is 7/25.\\n\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7/25\"\n}",
