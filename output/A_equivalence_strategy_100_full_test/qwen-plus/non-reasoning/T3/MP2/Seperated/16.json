So S ⊆ {1,2,3,4,5} with 5 ∈ S.\\n\\nWe need to count subsets containing 5, not containing 6, and no subset (including proper subsets) of S has sum 10. But note: the condition is that *no subset* of S has sum 10. That means even a proper subset of S cannot sum to 10.\\n\\nSo our goal is to count all non-empty subsets S with max(S) = 5 (so 5 ∈ S), and such that no subset of S sums to 10. Then define N_5 as that count, and compute k = N_5 - 8.\\n\\nStep 1: Enumerate all subsets of {1,2,3,4,5} that contain 5.\\nThere are 2^4 = 16 such subsets (since we fix 5, and freely choose any subset of {1,2,3,4}).\\nBut we exclude the empty subset? Wait — the subset S must be non-empty, but since it contains 5, all these 16 subsets are non-empty. So total possible candidates: 16.\\n\\nNow eliminate those subsets S for which some subset T ⊆ S has sum(T) = 10.\\nNote: It's not just S itself — any subset of S (including proper subsets) must not sum to 10.\\n\\nSo we need to reject any S that *contains a subset* (not necessarily proper) summing to 10.\\n\\nSo we first find all subsets of {1,2,3,4,5} that contain 5 and do **not** have any subset (including themselves) summing to 10.\\n\\nBut note: if a subset S contains a subset T ⊆ S with sum(T)=10, then S is invalid.\\nSo we must ensure that no combination of elements in S adds to 10.\\n\\nLet’s list all subsets of {1,2,3,4,5} that include 5, and check whether any subset of them sums to 10.\\n\\nInstead of listing all 16, let’s think: what combinations of numbers from {1,2,3,4,5} sum to 10?\\n\\nList all subsets of {1,2,3,4,5} (not necessarily containing 5) that sum to 10:\\n\\n- {4,3,2,1} → sum = 10 → this is one\\n- {5,4,1} → 5+4+1=10\\n- {5,3,2} → 5+3+2=10\\n- {4,3,2,1} = 10\\n- {5,1,4} already listed\\n- {2,3,5} already listed\\n- {1,2,3,4} = 10\\n- {1,4,5} = 10\\n- {2,3,5} = 10\\n- {6,4} but 6 not allowed here\\n- {1,2,7} no\\n- {10} no\\n- {4,6} no\\n- {1,3,6} no\\n- {2,8} no\\n- {3,7} no\\n- {1,2,3,4} = 10\\n- {2,4,4} no\\n- {1,2,7} no\\n- {3,4,3} no\\n- {5,3,2} = 10\\n- {5,4,1} = 10\\n- {2,3,4,1} = 10\\n- {6,3,1} no\\n- {5,5} no\\n- {4,6} no\\n- {1,9} no\\n- {2,3,5} = 10\\n- {1,4,5} = 10\\n- {2,8} no\\n- {3,7} no\\n- {4,3,2,1} = 10\\n- {5,1,2,2} no\\n\\nAlso: {1,2,3,4} = 10\\n{5,3,2} = 10\\n{5,4,1} = 10\\n{4,3,2,1} = 10 — same as above\\n{6,4} no\\n{7,3} no\\n{8,2} no\\n{9,1} no\\n{10} no\\n\\nAre there others?\\n{2,3,5} = 10\\n{1,4,5} = 10\\n{1,2,3,4} = 10\\n{2,4,4} no\\n{3,3,4} no\\n{1,3,6} no\\n{2,3,4,1} = 10 — same\\n{5,5} no\\n\\nWhat about {4,6}? Not in range\\n{1,2,7} no\\n\\n{3,4,3} no\\n\\nWait: {2,3,5} = 10\\n{1,4,5} = 10\\n{1,2,3,4} = 10\\n{4,3,2,1} = 10 — same\\n\\nIs there {6,3,1}? 6 not in\\n\\n{5,3,1,1} no\\n\\n{2,4,3,1} = 10 — same as {1,2,3,4}\\n\\nSo the only subsets summing to 10 within {1,2,3,4,5} are:\\n- {1,2,3,4} → sum = 10\\n- {1,4,5} → sum = 10\\n- {2,3,5} → sum = 10\\n\\nAre there others?\\nTry {1,3,6} no\\n{2,8} no\\n{4,5,1} already listed\\n{3,4,2,1} = 10 — same as first\\n{5,3,2} = 10\\n{5,4,1} = 10\\n{1,2,3,4} = 10\\n\\nWhat about {6,4}? 6 not in\\n{10}? 10 not in\\n{7,3}? no\\n{1,2,7}? no\\n{3,3,4}? 3+3+4=10 but only one 3\\n{2,2,3,3}? no\\n{1,1,8}? no\\n{4,6}? no\\n{5,5}? no\\n\\n{1,3,6}? no\\n{2,4,4}? no\\n{1,2,3,4} = 10\\n{1,4,5}=10\\n{2,3,5}=10\\n\\nWhat about {4,3,2,1} = 10 — same as {1,2,3,4}\\n\\nAny other combination?\\nTry {1,2,7} no\\n{3,7} no\\n{4,5,1} = 10 — already have\\n{3,5,2} = 10 — already have\\n{4,3,2,1} = 10 — already have\\n\\nHow about {6,3,1}? 6 not in\\n\\n{5,3,1,1}? no\\n\\n{2,3,4,1} = 10 — same\\n\\n{5,2,3} = 10\\n{5,1,4} = 10\\n{1,2,3,4} = 10\\n\\nIs there {6,4}? no\\n{7,2,1}? no\\n{8,1,1}? no\\n{9,1}? no\\n{10}? no\\n\\n{4,3,3}? no\\n\\n{2,2,3,3}? no\\n\\n{1,3,2,4} = 10 — same\\n\\nSo only three distinct subsets sum to 10:\\nA = {1,2,3,4}\\nB = {1,4,5}\\nC = {2,3,5}\\n\\nSo any subset S that contains 5 and is a candidate must **not** contain any of these as subsets. That is, S must not contain A, B, or C as subsets.\\n\\nBut since S ⊆ {1,2,3,4,5} and contains 5, we need to avoid having any of these three sets entirely inside S.\\n\\nBut more precisely: if S contains all elements of any of these sets, then that subset will sum to 10, so S is invalid.\\n\\nTherefore, to be valid, S must not contain {1,2,3,4} as a subset → so at least one of 1,2,3,4 is missing\\nAND S must not contain {1,4,5} → since 5 is always in S, we must not have both 1 and 4 in S\\nAND S must not contain {2,3,5} → since 5 is in S, we must not have both 2 and 3 in S\\n\\nSo the conditions for S (containing 5) to be valid are:\\n1. Not (1 ∈ S and 4 ∈ S)  → because {1,4,5} ⊆ S would sum to 10\\n2. Not (2 ∈ S and 3 ∈ S)  → because {2,3,5} ⊆ S would sum to 10\\n3. Not (1,2,3,4 all in S) → because {1,2,3,4} ⊆ S would sum to 10, even without 5\\n\\nBut wait: {1,2,3,4} does not include 5, but it's a subset of S, and its sum is 10, so if S contains {1,2,3,4}, then even though 5 is in S, the subset {1,2,3,4} alone sums to 10, so S is invalid.\\n\\nSo yes, condition 3 is necessary.\\n\\nHowever, note that condition 3 might be redundant: if 1,2,3,4 are all in S, then regardless of 5, the subset {1,2,3,4} sums to 10. But in our case, 5 is always in S, but that doesn't matter — the subset {1,2,3,4} is still present.\\n\\nBut actually, condition 3 is implied by the others? Not necessarily.\\n\\nFor example, suppose S contains 1,2,3,4,5. Then:\\n- {1,4,5} ⊆ S → sum 10 → invalid\\n- {2,3,5} ⊆ S → sum 10 → invalid\\n- {1,2,3,4} ⊆ S → sum 10 → invalid\\nSo multiple reasons.\\n\\nBut we need to avoid all such S.\\n\\nSo to count valid S (containing 5), we need to count subsets of {1,2,3,4} (call this T), and then S = T ∪ {5}, such that:\\n- T does not contain both 1 and 4\\n- T does not contain both 2 and 3\\n- T ≠ {1,2,3,4}  → but wait, if T = {1,2,3,4}, then it violates all three, but we already exclude it via the first two? Not necessarily.\\nSuppose T contains 1 and 4 → invalid by first condition\\nT contains 2 and 3 → invalid by second\\nBut T could contain 1,2,3,4 → then it violates both first and second conditions, so it would be excluded anyway.\\n\\nBut is there a T that contains all four but avoids the first two? No, because it contains 1 and 4, so violates first.\\n\\nSo condition 3 (avoiding {1,2,3,4}) is redundant, because if T = {1,2,3,4}, then 1 and 4 are both in, so it's already excluded by condition 1.\\n\\nSimilarly, even if we didn't have condition 1, condition 2 would exclude it only if 2 and 3 are both in, which they are, but condition 1 is sufficient.\\n\\nBut actually, condition 3 might not be redundant if there were a way to have all four without violating 1 or 2, but there isn't.\\n\\nSo we only need:\\n- Not (1 and 4 both in T)\\n- Not (2 and 3 both in T)\\n\\nBecause if both 1 and 4 are in, then {1,4,5} ⊆ S → sum 10\\nIf both 2 and 3 are in, then {2,3,5} ⊆ S → sum 10\\nAnd if all four are in, then both conditions violated, so excluded.\\n\\nMoreover, is there any other subset that sums to 10?\\nFor example, could a different combination sum to 10?\\nTry: {1,2,3,4} = 10 — covered\\n{1,4,5} = 10 — covered\\n{2,3,5} = 10 — covered\\n{3,4,2,1} = 10 — same\\n{5,3,1,1} no\\n{4,5,1} = 10 — same\\n{3,5,2} = 10 — same\\n{1,2,3,4} = 10\\n\\nWhat about {1,3,6}? no\\n{2,4,4}? no\\n{1,2,7}? no\\n{3,7}? no\\n{4,6}? no\\n{10}? no\\n{5,5}? no\\n\\n{1,2,3,4} = 10\\n{1,4,5}=10\\n{2,3,5}=10\\n\\n{3,4,3}? no\\n\\n{1,3,2,4} = 10 — same\\n\\n{5,1,2,2}? no\\n\\n{4,3,2,1} = 10 — same\\n\\n{6,1,3}? no\\n\\n{7,3}? no\\n\\n{8,2}? no\\n\\n{9,1}? no\\n\\n{4,2,3,1} = 10 — same\\n\\nSo only three minimal subsets.\\n\\nBut could there be a larger subset that includes extra elements but still has a subset summing to 10? Yes, but we are forbidding any subset summing to 10, so as long as one of these three is contained, it's bad.\\n\\nBut are there other subsets that sum to 10?\\nTry: {1,2,3,4} = 10\\n{1,4,5} = 10\\n{2,3,5} = 10\\n{1,3,6} no\\n{2,8} no\\n{4,5,1} = 10 — same\\n{3,5,2} = 10 — same\\n{1,2,7} no\\n{3,4,2,1} = 10 — same\\n{5,3,1,1} no\\n{4,3,2,1} = 10 — same\\n{1,5,4} = 10 — same\\n{2,5,3} = 10 — same\\n{1,2,3,4} = 10\\n\\nWhat about {6,4}? no\\n{7,2,1}? 7 not in\\n{3,3,4}? only one 3\\n{2,2,3,3}? no\\n{1,1,8}? no\\n{4,6}? no\\n{5,5}? no\\n\\n{1,2,3,4} = 10\\n{1,4,5} = 10\\n{2,3,5} = 10\\n\\n{3,4,3}? no\\n\\n{1,3,2,4} = 10 — same\\n\\n{5,2,3} = 10\\n{5,1,4} = 10\\n{1,2,3,4} = 10\\n\\n{4,2,3,1} = 10 — same\\n\\n{5,3,1,1}? no\\n\\n{2,4,3,1} = 10 — same\\n\\nSo I think that's all.\\n\\nBut wait: is {10} possible? No, 10 not in set.\\n{6,3,1} = 10, but 6 not in {1,2,3,4,5}\\n{7,2,1} = 10, 7 not in\\n{8,1,1} no\\n{9,1} no\\n{4,3,2,1} = 10 — already have\\n\\n{5,3,2} = 10 — have\\n{5,4,1} = 10 — have\\n{1,2,3,4} = 10 — have\\n\\n{2,4,4} no\\n\\n{3,3,4} = 10? 3+3+4=10, but only one 3 available\\n\\n{1,1,2,6} no\\n\\nSo only three subsets sum to 10.\\n\\nTherefore, the only ways a subset S (containing 5) can have a subset summing to 10 are if it contains {1,4,5}, or {2,3,5}, or {1,2,3,4}.\\n\\nBut {1,2,3,4} does not require 5, so if S contains {1,2,3,4}, then even without using 5, the sum is 10.\\n\\nNow, back to counting.\\n\\nWe have T ⊆ {1,2,3,4}, and S = T ∪ {5}\\nTotal possible T: 16\\nWe need to exclude T such that:\\n- 1 and 4 both in T → then {1,4,5} ⊆ S → sum 10\\n- 2 and 3 both in T → then {2,3,5} ⊆ S → sum 10\\n- Or T contains {1,2,3,4} → then {1,2,3,4} ⊆ S → sum 10\\n\\nBut as noted, if T contains {1,2,3,4}, then it contains 1 and 4, so it's already excluded by first condition.\\nSimilarly, it contains 2 and 3, so excluded by second.\\nSo the third condition is redundant.\\n\\nTherefore, we only need to exclude T that contain both 1 and 4, or both 2 and 3.\\n\\nUse inclusion-exclusion.\\nLet A = {T : 1∈T and 4∈T}\\nB = {T : 2∈T and 3∈T}\\nWe want |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|\\nThen number of bad T is |A ∪ B|, so good T is 16 - |A ∪ B|\\nThen N_5 = number of good S = number of good T (since each T gives a unique S)\\n\\n|A| = number of T with 1 and 4 fixed in, and 2,3 arbitrary → 2^2 = 4 (since 2 and 3 can be in or out)\\nSimilarly |B| = number with 2 and 3 fixed in, 1 and 4 arbitrary → 2^2 = 4\\n|A ∩ B| = T with 1,4,2,3 all in → only one such T: {1,2,3,4}\\nSo |A ∪ B| = 4 + 4 - 1 = 7\\nThus number of bad T is 7\\nNumber of good T is 16 - 7 = 9\\nSo N_5 = 9\\nThen k = N_5 - 8 = 9 - 8 = 1\\n\\nBut wait: are there any other subsets that sum to 10 that we missed?\\nFor example, could a single element be 10? No.\\nTwo elements: possible pairs:\\n1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+4=5, 1+5=6, 2+3=5, 2+4=6, 2+5=7, 3+4=7, 3+5=8, 4+5=9 — none is 10\\nThree elements: we have 1+4+5=10, 2+3+5=10, 1+2+3+4=10 but that's four\\nThree elements: 1+3+6 no, 1+2+7 no, 3+4+3 no, 4+5+1=10 — yes, have, 3+5+2=10 — yes\\n1+3+6 no\\n2+4+4 no\\n3+4+3 no\\n1+2+3+4=10 — four elements\\nFour elements: 1+2+3+4=10 — yes\\n1+2+3+5=11>10\\n1+2+4+5=12\\n1+3+4+5=13\\n2+3+4+5=14\\nFive elements: 15\\nSo only three-element sums: only {1,4,5} and {2,3,5}\\nFour-element: only {1,2,3,4}\\nNo five-element sum to 10\\n\\nSo no others.\\n\\nBut is there a subset like {1,2,7}? no\\nOr {10}? no\\nOr {4,6}? no\\n\\nSo only those three.\\n\\nBut what about {1,3,6}? no\\n\\nOr {2,8}? no\\n\\nSo yes.\\n\\nBut wait: is there a subset with more than four elements? S has at most five elements: {1,2,3,4,5}, sum=15>10, but we care about subsets summing to 10, not the whole set.\\n\\nBut we already considered all subsets.\\n\\nAnother possibility: {1,2,3,4} is one, but also, is there a different combination?\\nTry {1,3,2,4} same\\n{5,3,1,1} no\\n{4,3,2,1} same\\n{5,4,1} same\\n{5,3,2} same\\n{1,4,5} same\\n{2,3,5} same\\n{1,2,3,4} same\\n\\n{3,4,2,1} = 10 — same\\n\\n{1,5,4} = 10 — same\\n\\nSo no.\\n\\nBut what about {6,4}? 6 not in\\n\\nOr {7,3}? no\\n\\nSo I think we have all.\\n\\nBut let me double-check: is there a subset like {1,2,3,4} = 10\\n{1,4,5}=10\\n{2,3,5}=10\\n\\nIs {1,3,6}? no\\n{2,4,4}? no\\n{3,3,4}? no\\n{1,1,8}? no\\n{2,2,6}? no\\n{3,7}? no\\n{4,6}? no\\n{5,5}? no\\n{10}? no\\n\\n{1,2,3,4} = 10\\n{1,4,5} = 10\\n{2,3,5} = 10\\n\\n{3,4,3}? no\\n\\n{1,2,7}? no\\n\\n{4,5,1} = 10 — same\\n\\n{3,5,2} = 10 — same\\n\\n{2,4,3,1} = 10 — same\\n\\n{1,3,2,4} = 10 — same\\n\\nSo yes.\\n\\nNow, back to count.\\n|A| = T with 1 and 4: 2 choices for 2 (in/out), 2 for 3 → 4\\nSimilarly |B| = 4\\n|A ∩ B| = T with 1,4,2,3 all in → only one\\nSo |A ∪ B| = 4+4-1=7\\nGood T: 16-7=9\\nN_5 = 9\\nk = 9 - 8 = 1\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"no subset of S has the property that the sum of its elements is 10\\\"\\nWe assumed that avoiding the three forbidden configurations is sufficient.\\nBut is it possible that some other subset of S sums to 10, even if it doesn't contain those?\\nFor example, suppose S contains 1,2,3,5 — but not 4.\\nThen does any subset sum to 10?\\nSubsets:\\nSingle: 1,2,3,5\\nPairs: 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+5=6, 2+3=5, 2+5=7, 3+5=8\\nTriples: 1+2+3=6, 1+2+5=8, 1+3+5=9, 2+3+5=10 → oh! {2,3,5} sum to 10\\nBut if 2 and 3 are both in, and 5 is in, then {2,3,5} ⊆ S, sum=10\\nBut in our condition, we excluded T that have both 2 and 3, so this is already excluded.\\nSimilarly, if S has 1,4,5, then {1,4,5} sum to 10, and we excluded if 1 and 4 both in.\\nNow, what if S has 1,2,3,4, but not both 1 and 4? Impossible, since if it has 1,2,3,4, it has 1 and 4.\\nBut we excluded if 1 and 4 both in.\\nNow, is there a subset like {1,2,3,4} but missing one? Sum less than 10.\\nFor example, {1,2,3,4} = 10, but if missing one, say missing 4: {1,2,3} = 6\\nMissing 3: {1,2,4} = 7\\nEtc.\\nOr {1,3,4,2} = 10 — same\\n\\nWhat about five elements: {1,2,3,4,5} sum=15, but subsets we already covered.\\n\\nAnother possibility: {1,2,3,4} = 10, but if S doesn't contain all, but contains a different combination.\\nFor example, suppose S = {1,2,4,5} — does it have a subset summing to 10?\\nCheck: \\nSingles: no\\nPairs: 1+2=3, 1+4=5, 1+5=6, 2+4=6, 2+5=7, 4+5=9\\nTriples: 1+2+4=7, 1+2+5=8, 1+4+5=10 → yes! {1,4,5} sum to 10\\nAnd in this case, 1 and 4 are both in, so we excluded it in condition A.\\nSimilarly, if S = {2,3,4,5}, then {2,3,5} = 10, and 2 and 3 both in, so excluded by B.\\nNow, what if S = {1,2,3,5}?

What if b=0 or c=0?\\nWe assumed a=0, but b and c could be zero, but if b=0, then bc=0, bc+1=1≠84, contradiction.\\nSimilarly, if c=0, bc=0, bc+1=1≠84.\\nSo only when b and c are nonzero, specifically the pairs above.\\nSo for a=0, we have two solutions: (0,1,83), (0,83,1)\\nBy symmetry, if b=0, then ab+1=a*0+1=1, bc+1=0*c+1=1, ca+1=c a +1\\nProduct: 1*1*(ca+1)=ca+1=84, so ca=83\\nSo (c,a)=(1,83) or (83,1)\\nSo triples: (a,b,c) = (83,0,1), (1,0,83)\\nSimilarly, if c=0, then bc+1=b*0+1=1, ca+1=0*a+1=1, ab+1=ab+1\\nProduct: (ab+1)*1*1=ab+1=84, so ab=83\\nSo (a,b)=(1,83) or (83,1)\\nTriples: (1,83,0), (83,1,0)\\nNow, are there overlaps? For example, if two are zero?\\nSuppose a=0,b=0, then ab+1=1, bc+1=0*c+1=1, ca+1=c*0+1=1, product=1≠84\\nSimilarly, any two zero gives product 1\\nAll three zero: same\\nSo no overlap.\\nSo far, we have:\\nFrom a=0: (0,1,83), (0,83,1)\\nFrom b=0: (83,0,1), (1,0,83)\\nFrom c=0: (1,83,0), (83,1,0)\\nSo six solutions where one variable is zero.\\nNow, case 2: all a,b,c ≥1\\nThen ab+1 ≥2, bc+1≥2, ca+1≥2, and product=84.\\nSo we need to factor 84 into three integers each at least 2.\\nFirst, factorize 84: 84=2^2 * 3 * 7\\nNow, find all ordered triples (x,y,z) of integers ≥2 such that x y z =84.\\nBut x=ab+1, y=bc+1, z=ca+1\\nNote that x,y,z ≥2\\nNow, the number of unordered ways, but since ordered, we need to consider all permutations.\\nBut also, for each such (x,y,z), we need to solve for a,b,c nonnegative integers (but now ≥1) such that:\\nab+1 = x ⇒ ab = x-1\\nbc+1 = y ⇒ bc = y-1\\nca+1 = z ⇒ ca = z-1\\nNow, since a,b,c ≥1, we can work with these.\\nNote that (ab)(bc)(ca) = (x-1)(y-1)(z-1)\\nBut ab * bc * ca = a^2 b^2 c^2 = (a b c)^2\\nSo (a b c)^2 = (x-1)(y-1)(z-1)\\nThus a b c = sqrt( (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) ) , and it must be an integer.\\nMoreover, from ab = x-1, bc=y-1, ca=z-1, we can solve.\\nFor example, multiply ab and ca: (ab)(ca) = a^2 b c = (x-1)(z-1)\\nBut bc = y-1, so a^2 (bc) = a^2 (y-1) = (x-1)(z-1)\\nThus a^2 = (x-1)(z-1) / (y-1)\\nSimilarly for others.\\nSo for a to be integer, (x-1)(z-1)/(y-1) must be a perfect square, and similarly.\\nBut perhaps easier to list all possible ordered triples (x,y,z) with x,y,z≥2, xyz=84, and for each, compute d_x = x-1, d_y=y-1, d_z=z-1, then check if (d_x d_y d_z) is a perfect square, and then solve for a,b,c.\\nSince 84 is small, we can list all possible ordered triples.\\nFirst, find all divisors of 84: 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,14,21,28,42,84\\nBut x,y,z ≥2, so exclude 1.\\nNow, list all ordered triples (x,y,z) such that x y z =84, x,y,z≥2.\\nWe can fix x, then y, then z=84/(x y), and z must be integer ≥2.\\nStart with x=2\\nThen y z =42, y≥2, z≥2\\ny can be divisors of 42 that are ≥2: 2,3,6,7,14,21,42\\nBut z=42/y ≥2, so y≤21\\nSo y=2,3,6,7,14,21\\ny=2, z=21\\ny=3, z=14\\ny=6, z=7\\ny=7, z=6\\ny=14, z=3\\ny=21, z=2\\nAll z≥2, good.\\nSo for x=2: (2,2,21), (2,3,14), (2,6,7), (2,7,6), (2,14,3), (2,21,2)\\nNow x=3\\ny z =28, y≥2,z≥2\\nDivisors of 28: 2,4,7,14,28\\ny≤14 since z≥2\\ny=2, z=14\\ny=4, z=7\\ny=7, z=4\\ny=14, z=2\\ny=28, z=1<2, invalid\\nSo (3,2,14), (3,4,7), (3,7,4), (3,14,2)\\nNow x=4\\ny z =21, y≥2,z≥2\\nDivisors: 3,7,21 (since 21=3*7)\\nBut y≥2, so y=3,7,21\\ny=3, z=7\\ny=7, z=3\\ny=21, z=1<2, invalid\\nSo (4,3,7), (4,7,3)\\nNow x=6\\ny z =14, y≥2,z≥2\\nDivisors: 2,7,14\\ny=2, z=7\\ny=7, z=2\\ny=14, z=1<2, no\\nSo (6,2,7), (6,7,2)\\nNow x=7\\ny z =12, y≥2,z≥2\\nDivisors: 2,3,4,6,12\\ny=2, z=6\\ny=3, z=4\\ny=4, z=3\\ny=6, z=2\\ny=12, z=1<2, no\\nSo (7,2,6), (7,3,4), (7,4,3), (7,6,2)\\nNow x=12\\ny z =7, y≥2,z≥2\\n7 is prime, so y=7, z=1<2, invalid; or y=1,z=7 but y≥2 not satisfied\\nNo solution\\nx=14\\ny z =6, y≥2,z≥2\\ny=2, z=3\\ny=3, z=2\\ny=6, z=1<2, no\\nSo (14,2,3), (14,3,2)\\nx=21\\ny z =4, y≥2,z≥2\\ny=2, z=2\\ny=4, z=1<2, no\\nSo (21,2,2)\\nx=28\\ny z =3, y≥2,z≥2\\ny=3, z=1<2, no; y=1,z=3 not y≥2\\nNo\\nx=42\\ny z =2, y≥2,z≥2\\ny=2, z=1<2, no\\nx=84\\ny z =1, z=1<2, no\\nSo all ordered triples:\\nFrom x=2: (2,2,21), (2,3,14), (2,6,7), (2,7,6), (2,14,3), (2,21,2)\\nFrom x=3: (3,2,14), (3,4,7), (3,7,4), (3,14,2)\\nFrom x=4: (4,3,7), (4,7,3)\\nFrom x=6: (6,2,7), (6,7,2)\\nFrom x=7: (7,2,6), (7,3,4), (7,4,3), (7,6,2)\\nFrom x=14: (14,2,3), (14,3,2)\\nFrom x=21: (21,2,2)\\nNow, also, when we had x=2, we have (2,21,2), etc.\\nBut we need to consider that the triples are ordered, so all are distinct unless same values.\\nNow, total number: let's count.\\nx=2: 6\\nx=3: 4\\nx=4: 2\\nx=6: 2\\nx=7: 4\\nx=14: 2\\nx=21: 1\\nTotal: 6+4=10, +2=12, +2=14, +4=18, +2=20, +1=21\\nBut many are permutations.\\nNow, for each such (x,y,z), set d_x = x-1, d_y=y-1, d_z=z-1\\nThen ab = d_x, bc = d_y, ca = d_z\\nThen as before, (ab)(bc)(ca) = d_x d_y d_z = a^2 b^2 c^2 = (abc)^2\\nSo abc = sqrt(d_x d_y d_z), must be integer.\\nMoreover, from ab = d_x, bc = d_y, then a/c = (ab)/(bc) = d_x / d_y, so a d_y = c d_x\\nSimilarly, from ca = d_z, etc.\\nBut perhaps compute d_x d_y d_z and see if square.\\nSince abc = sqrt(d_x d_y d_z), and a = abc / (bc) = abc / d_y, so a = sqrt(d_x d_y d_z) / d_y = sqrt(d_x d_z / d_y)\\nSimilarly, a must be positive integer, so d_x d_z / d_y must be perfect square, and similarly for others.\\nBut we can compute for each triple.\\nList each (x,y,z) and compute d_x=x-1, d_y=y-1, d_z=z-1, then p = d_x d_y d_z, and check if p is perfect square.\\nStart:\\n1.

No, because in one-zero, one variable is zero, in others all positive.\\nSo total 6 + 6 = 12 solutions.\\nBut let me list them all.\\nOne-zero:\\n(0,1,83), (0,83,1), (83,0,1), (1,0,83), (1,83,0), (83,1,0)\\nAll-positive:\\n(2,1,3), (1,2,3), (3,1,2), (1,3,2), (3,2,1), (2,3,1)\\nNow, verify one.\\nTake (2,1,3): ab+1=2*1+1=3, bc+1=1*3+1=4, ca+1=3*2+1=7, product 3*4*7=84, yes.\\nTake (0,1,83): ab+1=0*1+1=1, bc+1=1*83+1=84, ca+1=83*0+1=1, product 1*84*1=84, yes.\\nNow, is there any other solution?\\nFor example, could there be solutions where a,b,c >0 but not covered?\\nWe listed all possible (x,y,z) with xyz=84, x,y,z≥2, and only the permutations of (3,4,7) gave integer solutions.\\nBut what if one of x,y,z is 1? But we assumed all ≥1, but in the all-positive case, since a,b,c≥1, ab≥1, so ab+1≥2, similarly, so x,y,z≥2, so we covered.\\nBut when one variable is zero, we handled separately, and got x,y,z including 1.\\nFor example, when a=0, we had x=ab+1=1, z=ca+1=1, y=bc+1=84\\nSo (x,y,z)=(1,84,1), but in our list for the all-positive case, we required x,y,z≥2, so we didn't include such, but we handled the zero case separately.\\nNow, are there solutions where, say, a=0, but b or c zero? But we saw that if two zero, product is 1, not 84.\\nSuppose a=0, b arbitrary, but earlier we had bc+1=84, so if b=0, then 0*c+1=1≠84, so b cannot be zero, similarly c cannot be zero when a=0.\\nSo in the one-zero case, the other two are nonzero, as we have.\\nNow, another thing: in the all-positive solutions, we have a,b,c being 1,2,3 in some order, but not all permutations.\\nWe have (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), (3,2,1) — that's all six permutations of (1,2,3).\\nYes, exactly the six we have.\\nNow, in the zero cases, we have the six where one is zero, and the other two are 1 and 83 in some order, but with the zero in different positions.\\nSpecifically:\\n- a=0, b=1,c=83 or b=83,c=1\\n- b=0, a=1,c=83 or a=83,c=1\\n- c=0, a=1,b=83 or a=83,b=1\\nSo all combinations.\\nNow, total 6 (with zero) + 6 (all positive) = 12\\nBut is (1,1,1) a solution? ab+1=1+1=2? ab=1*1=1, ab+1=2, similarly all are 2, product 8≠84, no.\\nOr other values.\\nSuppose a=b=c, then (a^2+1)^3=84, but 84^{1/3}≈4.4, not integer, and a^2+1≥2, 2^3=8, 3^3=27, 4^3=64, 5^3=125>84, none 84.\\nOr other symmetries.\\nI think we have all.\\nBut in the zero case, when we have (0,1,83), etc., and in positive, (1,2,3) etc.\\nNow, is there a solution where, say, a=83, b=0, c=1, which we have.\\nAll seem covered.\\nBut let me confirm the count.\\nTotal solutions: 12.\\nBut the problem asks for ordered triples of nonnegative integers, so includes zero.\\nNow, in the all-positive solutions, we have six, all permutations of (1,2,3)\\nIn the one-zero solutions, we have: for each choice of which variable is zero (3 choices), and then the other two variables: one must be 1, the other 83, but since ordered, we can assign which is 1 and which is 83.\\nFor example, if a=0, then (b,c) = (1,83) or (83,1)\\nSimilarly for others.\\nSo for each position of zero, two choices for the pair (1,83) in the other two variables.\\nSo 3 positions × 2 assignments = 6, as we have.\\nTotal 6 + 6 = 12.\\nNow, is there a solution where two variables are equal, or other?\\nSuppose a=1, b=1, then ab+1=1*1+1=2\\nThen (2)(bc+1)(c*1+1)=2(bc+1)(c+1)=84\\nSo (bc+1)(c+1)=42\\nNow b=1, so (1*c +1)(c+1)=(c+1)(c+1)=(c+1)^2=42, not integer.\\nOr a=2,b=2, ab+1=4+1=5\\nThen 5(bc+1)(2c+1)=84\\nSo (bc+1)(2c+1)=84/5=16.8, not integer.\\nOther trials probably not necessary since we systematically covered.\\nAnother possible: if a=3,b=3, ab+1=9+1=10\\nThen 10(bc+1)(3c+1)=84, so (bc+1)(3c+1)=8.4, not integer.\\nOr a=1,b=3, ab+1=3+1=4\\nThen 4(bc+1)(c*1+1)=4(bc+1)(c+1)=84\\nSo (bc+1)(c+1)=21\\nb=3, so (3c+1)(c+1)=21\\nSet d=c, (3d+1)(d+1)=3d^2 +3d +d +1=3d^2+4d+1=21\\n3d^2+4d-20=0\\nDiscriminant 16+240=256=16^2, d=( -4 ± 16)/6, d=12/6=2 or d=-20/6 not integer\\nd=2, so c=2\\nThen bc+1=3*2+1=7, ca+1=2*1+1=3, ab+1=1*3+1=4, product 4*7*3=84, yes!\\nBut this is (a,b,c)=(1,3,2), which is already in our list.\\nSimilarly, others are covered.\\nSo no new solutions.\\nThus total 12 ordered triples.\\nBut in our list, we have 12.\\nNow, back to problem 1, we have k=1\\nProblem 2, answer is 12\\nBut let me confirm problem 1.\\nIn problem 1, we have N_5=9, k=N_5-8=1\\nBut the problem says \\\"find k = N_5 - 8\\\", and N_5 is the number of non-empty subsets with largest element 5 satisfying the condition.\\nWe found 9 such subsets.\\nList them to confirm.\\nS contains 5, and subset T of {1,2,3,4} such that not both 1 and 4, not both 2 and 3.\\nGood T: {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}\\nCorresponding S:\\n1. {5}\\n2. {1,5}\\n3. {2,5}\\n4. {3,5}\\n5. {4,5}\\n6. {1,2,5}\\n7. {1,3,5}\\n8. {2,4,5}\\n9. {3,4,5}\\nNow, check that no subset sums to 10.\\n1. {5}: sum=5, subsets: only {5}, sum=5≠10\\n2. {1,5}: sums:1,5,6≠10\\n3. {2,5}:2,5,7≠10\\n4. {3,5}:3,5,8≠10\\n5. {4,5}:4,5,9≠10\\n6. {1,2,5}: sums:1,2,5,1+2=3,1+5=6,2+5=7,1+2+5=8≠10\\n7. {1,3,5}:1,3,5,1+3=4,1+5=6,3+5=8,1+3+5=9≠10\\n8. {2,4,5}:2,4,5,2+4=6,2+5=7,4+5=9,2+4+5=11≠10\\n9. {3,4,5}:3,4,5,3+4=7,3+5=8,4+5=9,3+4+5=12≠10\\nAll good.\\nNow, are there any others? For example, {1,4,5}: but 1 and 4 both in, excluded, and {1,4,5}=10, bad.\\n{2,3,5}:2+3+5=10, bad.\\n{1,2,3,5}:2+3+5=10, bad.\\nEtc.\\nSo yes, 9.\\nThus k=9-8=1.\\nSo answer for problem 1 is 1.\\nProblem 2 is 12.\\n\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"12\"\n}",
