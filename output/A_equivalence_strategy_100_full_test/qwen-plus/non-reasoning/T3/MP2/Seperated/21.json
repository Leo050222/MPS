  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\n\\nWe are given a function f(t) = t / (t^3 + 8), and we are to analyze the tangent line approximation at t = 1. Then, we compute k = p(1) + 1, where p(x) is the numerator polynomial of the scaled difference between the tangent line and the function.\\n\\nStep 1: Compute f(1)\\nf(1) = 1 / (1^3 + 8) = 1/9\\n\\nStep 2: Compute f'(t)\\nf(t) = t / (t^3 + 8)\\nUsing quotient rule:\\nf'(t) = [(1)(t^3 + 8) - t(3t^2)] / (t^3 + 8)^2\\n      = (t^3 + 8 - 3t^3) / (t^3 + 8)^2\\n      = (8 - 2t^3) / (t^3 + 8)^2\\n\\nf'(1) = (8 - 2) / (1 + 8)^2 = 6 / 81 = 2/27\\n\\nStep 3: Tangent line at t = 1\\nL(t) = f(1) + f'(1)(t - 1) = 1/9 + (2/27)(t - 1)\\n\\nStep 4: Consider the difference f(t) - L(t)\\nWe are told to consider the scaled difference between the tangent and the function. The standard method in such inequalities is to consider:\\nf(t) ≤ L(t) for all t ≥ 0 (if concave), and equality at t=1.\\nBut here, we are to form:\\nf(t) - L(t) = [t/(t^3+8)] - [1/9 + (2/27)(t - 1)]\\nTo analyze this, bring to common denominator. But instead of analyzing inequality, we are told to extract p(x), the numerator polynomial in the scaled difference.\\n\\nLet’s define:\\nD(t) = f(t) - L(t) = t/(t^3+8) - [1/9 + (2/27)(t - 1)]\\nMultiply D(t) by the denominator (t^3 + 8) to clear it, but to make it a polynomial comparison, consider:\\n(t^3 + 8) * D(t) = t - (t^3 + 8)[1/9 + (2/27)(t - 1)]\\nBut better: consider the expression:\\nf(t) - L(t) = A(t)/B(t), then the numerator is a rational function. We are to consider the numerator of the difference when written over a common denominator.\\n\\nSo let’s write:\\nf(t) - L(t) = t/(t^3 + 8) - 1/9 - (2/27)(t - 1)\\nGet common denominator. Let’s combine all terms over a common denominator, say 27(t^3 + 8).\\nBut the problem says: \\\"the numerator polynomial in the scaled difference\\\" — likely meaning that we consider:\\ng(t) = (t^3 + 8)(f(t) - L(t)) = t - (t^3 + 8)L(t)\\nBut more precisely, since f(t) - L(t) = [numerator] / (t^3 + 8), then the numerator is:\\nn(t) = t - (t^3 + 8) * L(t)\\nBut L(t) is linear, so n(t) will be a cubic or quartic?\\nWait: L(t) is linear, (t^3 + 8) * L(t) is degree 4, so n(t) is degree 4.\\nBut perhaps they mean the numerator when f(t) - L(t) is written as a single fraction.\\nLet’s do that:\\nf(t) - L(t) = \\\\frac{t}{t^3+8} - \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{9} + \\\\frac{2}{27}(t - 1)\\\\right)\\nCompute the second term:\\nL(t) = 1/9 + (2/27)t - 2/27 = (2/27)t + (1/9 - 2/27) = (2/27)t + (3 - 2)/27 = (2/27)t + 1/27\\nSo L(t) = (2t + 1)/27\\nThus:\\nf(t) - L(t) = \\\\frac{t}{t^3+8} - \\\\frac{2t+1}{27}\\nNow common denominator is 27(t^3 + 8):\\n= [27t - (2t+1)(t^3 + 8)] / [27(t^3 + 8)]\\nNumerator: 27t - (2t+1)(t^3 + 8)\\nExpand (2t+1)(t^3 + 8) = 2t(t^3 + 8) + 1(t^3 + 8) = 2t^4 + 16t + t^3 + 8 = 2t^4 + t^3 + 16t + 8\\nThen numerator: 27t - (2t^4 + t^3 + 16t + 8) = -2t^4 - t^3 + 11t - 8\\nSo the numerator polynomial is p(t) = -2t^4 - t^3 + 11t - 8\\nBut the problem says \\\"p(x) is the numerator polynomial\\\", so p(x) = -2x^4 - x^3 + 11x - 8\\nThen k = p(1) + 1\\np(1) = -2(1)^4 - (1)^3 + 11(1) - 8 = -2 -1 +11 -8 = 0\\nSo k = 0 + 1 = 1\\n\\nThus answer to Problem 1 is 1.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nWe are to find the number of ordered triples (x, y, n) of positive integers with n > 1 such that:\\nx^n - y^n = 2^{100}\\n\\nNote: x, y, n ∈ ℤ⁺, n > 1\\n\\nWe use the identity:\\nx^n - y^n = (x - y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + ... + y^{n-1})\\nSince the right-hand side is 2^{100}, both factors must be powers of 2.\\nAlso, x > y since x^n = y^n + 2^{100} > y^n\\n\\nLet d = x - y ≥ 1, and d | 2^{100}, so d = 2^k for some k ≥ 0\\nAlso, the second factor S = x^{n-1} + ... + y^{n-1} must also be a power of 2, say 2^m, with k + m = 100\\n\\nMoreover, since x = y + d = y + 2^k, we can write S in terms of y and k.\\nBut instead, use known results or bounds.\\n\\nKey idea: For n > 1, x^n - y^n = 2^{100} has limited solutions because differences of powers grow quickly.\\n\\nKnown fact: The equation x^n - y^n = c for fixed c has only finitely many solutions, but here c is a power of 2, and we want all.\\n\\nTry small n first.\\n\\nCase 1: n even\\nIf n is even, then x^n and y^n are both perfect squares (if n divisible by 2), but more importantly, x^n - y^n can be factored as difference of squares:\\nBut more useful: modulo considerations.\\n\\nBut try to see possible n.\\n\\nNote: If n is composite, say n = ab, then x^n - y^n = (x^a)^b - (y^a)^b, so it reduces, but still.\\n\\nBetter: Use lifting the exponent lemma (LTE).\\n\\nLTE is useful for v_2(x^n - y^n) when x, y are odd or even.\\nBut here x^n - y^n = 2^{100}, so v_2(x^n - y^n) = 100\\n\\nApply LTE for p=2.\\n\\nLTE has conditions.\\nFor odd x, y, and n even, v_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2(x - y) + v_2(x + y) + v_2(n) - 1\\nBut if x and y are both odd, then x - y and x + y are even.\\nBut in our case, x^n - y^n = 2^{100}, so left side is power of 2, so x and y cannot both be odd unless the sum/difference gives exact power.\\nBut let’s consider parity.\\n\\nSubcase 1: x and y both odd → x^n and y^n odd → x^n - y^n even, but is it divisible by 4? Yes, since odd^n ≡ 1 mod 4, so difference ≡ 0 mod 4? 1 - 1 = 0 mod 4? Not necessarily, e.g., 3^2 = 9 ≡ 1, 1^2=1, diff=8≡0 mod 8, actually odd squares are 1 mod 8, so difference divisible by 8? Wait.\\nActually, if x and y odd, x ≡ ±1 mod 4, so x^n ≡ 1 mod 4 if n even, ≡ x mod 4 if n odd. Similarly for y.\\nBut difference: if n even, x^n ≡ 1 mod 8 for odd x? Actually, odd squares are 1 mod 8, so if n even, x^n = (x^2)^{n/2} ≡ 1^{n/2} = 1 mod 8, similarly y^n ≡ 1 mod 8, so x^n - y^n ≡ 0 mod 8. So divisible by 8.\\nBut 2^{100} is divisible by 8, so possible.\\n\\nBut if one of x,y even, other odd: then x^n - y^n is odd minus even or vice versa → odd, but 2^{100} is even for 100≥1, contradiction. So both x and y must be even or both odd.\\nBut if both even, then x^n and y^n divisible by high powers of 2, so their difference might have lower valuation.\\nBut let’s suppose both even. Let v = min(v_2(x), v_2(y)). Since x > y, possibly v_2(x) ≠ v_2(y). But assume v_2(x) = a, v_2(y) = b.\\nThen v_2(x^n) = n a, v_2(y^n) = n b\\nv_2(x^n - y^n) = min(n a, n b) if a ≠ b, or ≥ n a if a = b.\\nBut v_2(x^n - y^n) = 100\\nSo if a ≠ b, say a < b, then v_2(x^n - y^n) = n a = 100\\nSimilarly if b < a, v_2 = n b = 100\\nIf a = b, then v_2(x^n - y^n) ≥ n a, and could be higher.\\n\\nBut also, we can factor out 2^{n a} from both terms if a = b.\\nSet x = 2^a u, y = 2^a v, with u,v odd.\\nThen x^n - y^n = 2^{n a} (u^n - v^n) = 2^{100}\\nSo u^n - v^n = 2^{100 - n a}\\nNow u and v odd, so u^n - v^n is even, so 100 - n a ≥ 1\\nAlso, u^n - v^n ≥ 1^n - 0^n but v ≥1, u > v since x > y, so u ≥ v+1 ≥ 2, so u^n - v^n ≥ (v+1)^n - v^n ≥ n v^{n-1} ≥ n ≥ 2\\nSo 2^{100 - n a} ≥ 2, so 100 - n a ≥ 1\\nBut also, u^n - v^n is at least 2, and is a power of 2.\\n\\nNow, if a ≠ b, without loss of generality a < b, then v_2(x^n - y^n) = n a = 100\\nSo n divides 100, and a = 100 / n\\nThen x = 2^{100/n} u, y = 2^b v with b > a, u odd, v integer.\\nBut y = 2^b v, so v_2(y) = b > a = 100/n\\nThen y^n = 2^{n b} v^n, with n b > n a = 100\\nx^n = 2^{100} u^n\\nSo x^n - y^n = 2^{100} u^n - 2^{n b} v^n = 2^{100} (u^n - 2^{n b - 100} v^n)\\nSince n b > 100, the term in parentheses is u^n - even number, so odd minus even = odd, so v_2 = 100, which matches.\\nBut the expression equals 2^{100}, so:\\n2^{100} (u^n - 2^{n b - 100} v^n) = 2^{100} ⇒ u^n - 2^{n b - 100} v^n = 1\\nSo u^n - w = 1, where w = 2^{n b - 100} v^n ≥ 1\\nSo u^n - 1 = w ≥ 1\\nu^n = w + 1\\nBut w is divisible by 2^{n b - 100} ≥ 2^1 = 2 since n b > 100 and integers, so n b ≥ 101, so exponent ≥1\\nSo u^n ≡ 1 mod 2^{k} for k ≥1\\nBut u odd, so possible.\\nEquation: u^n - 1 = 2^{m} v^n, where m = n b - 100 ≥1\\nBut in our case, it's u^n - 1 = 2^{m} v^n\\nBut v is integer, could be odd or even, but since we set y = 2^b v, and b = v_2(y), we can take v odd.\\nSo v odd.\\nSo we have u^n - 1 = 2^m v^n, with m ≥1, u,v odd positive integers, u ≥1, but u^n = 1 + something ≥2, so u ≥2\\n\\nThis looks like generalized Pell or Catalan-type, but Catalan's conjecture (Mihăilescu's theorem) says that the only solution in the natural numbers of x^a - y^b = 1 for a,b>1, x,y>0 is 3^2 - 2^3 = 1.\\nHere, u^n - (2^{m/n} v)^n =1? No, not a pure power.\\nWe have u^n - 1 = 2^m v^n\\nSo (u^n - 1) is a perfect n-th power times a power of 2.\\nBut for fixed n, we can analyze.\\nNote that u^n - 1 = (u-1)(u^{n-1} + ... + 1)\\nAnd this equals 2^m v^n\\nSince u odd, u-1 even, and the second factor is odd if n odd? No.\\nFor example, u=3, n=2: 9-1=8=2^3, so v=1, m=3\\nCheck: u^n -1 =8=2^3 *1^2, so yes.\\nIn this case, m=3, v=1\\nRecall: m = n b - 100 = 2b - 100\\nSet equal to 3: 2b - 100 =3 → 2b=103 → b=51.5, not integer. Invalid.\\nAnother solution: u=2, n any: 2^n -1 = 2^m v^n\\nBut u must be odd, so u≥3\\nu=3,n=1: but n>1\\nu=3,n=2: 9-1=8=2^3 *1^2, so v=1,m=3\\nu=3,n=3: 27-1=26=2*13, not a power of 2 times a cube? 26=2^1 * 13^1, v would need to be 13^{1/3}, not integer.\\nu=5,n=2:25-1=24=8*3=2^3*3, so v=√3, not integer.\\nu=5,n=4:625-1=624=16*39=2^4*3*13, not a fourth power times power of 2.\\nu=9,n=2:81-1=80=16*5=2^4*5, v=√5 no\\nu=2^k +1, but hard.\\nNote that for n>1, u^n -1 is rarely a perfect power.\\nBut in our case, it's 2^m v^n, so almost a perfect n-th power.\\nBut from Catalan, the only time two perfect powers differ by 1 is 9 and 8.\\nHere, u^n and 1 differ by 2^m v^n, which is at least 2, so not 1.\\nBut perhaps only small solutions.\\nSuppose v=1, then u^n - 2^m =1\\nSo u^n - 1 = 2^m\\nSolutions to u^n = 2^m +1\\nFor n=2: u^2 = 2^m +1, so 2^m = u^2 -1 = (u-1)(u+1)\\nSince powers of 2, u-1 and u+1 differ by 2, so possible only if u-1=2, u+1=4 → u=3, 2^m=8, m=3\\nOr u-1=1, u+1=2 → u=2, but u must be odd? u=2 even, but we assumed u odd? In this subcase, when a<b, we have u odd, so u=2 invalid.\\nSo only u=3,m=3\\nThen as before, m= n b -100 =2b -100=3 → b=103/2 not integer.\\nNext, n=3: u^3 = 2^m +1\\nu=1:1=2^m+1→m=-1 invalid\\nu=2:8=2^m+1→2^m=7 no\\nu=3:27=2^m+1→26 no\\nu=4:64=2^m+1→63 no\\nu=5:125→124=4*31 no\\nu=9:729→728=8*91 no\\nOnly solution is m=0,u=1 but m≥1\\nOr m=3,u=2 but u even\\nNo solution for n=3\\nn=4: u^4=2^m+1\\nu=1:1=2^m+1→m=-1\\nu=2:16=2^m+1→15 no\\nu=3:81→80 no\\nNo\\nSimilarly, only known solution is 2^3 +1=9=3^2, which we had.\\nSo no solutions in this subcase (a<b) with v=1\\nWhat if v>1?\\nThen u^n -1 =2^m v^n ≥ 2^m * 2^n = 2^{m+n} since v≥2\\nBut u^n ≥ 2^{m+n} +1 > 2^{m+n}\\nBut also from earlier, m = n b -100 ≥1\\nBut hard to find solutions.\\nPerhaps no solutions when a≠b.\\nSimilarly if b<a, same thing by symmetry, but since x>y, and a=v_2(x), b=v_2(y), if b<a, then v_2(y^n)=n b < n a =v_2(x^n), so v_2(x^n - y^n)=n b=100, so n|100, b=100/n\\nThen similarly y = 2^b v, x=2^a u with a>b, u odd\\nThen x^n - y^n = 2^{n b} (2^{n(a-b)} u^n - v^n) = 2^{100}\\nSo 2^{n(a-b)} u^n - v^n =1\\nSo w - v^n =1, where w=2^{n(a-b)} u^n\\nSo w = v^n +1\\nThus v^n +1 = 2^{k} u^n, with k=n(a-b)≥n≥2\\nSo v^n +1 is a perfect n-th power times a power of 2.\\nAgain, Catalan-like.\\nv=1: 1+1=2=2^1 u^n, so u^n=2^{1-k} ≤2^{-1} <1, impossible since k≥2\\nv=2: 2^n +1 = 2^k u^n\\nFor n=2: 4+1=5=2^k u^2, not possible\\nn=3:8+1=9=2^k u^3, 9 not divisible by 2, so k=0, but k≥2? k=n(a-b)≥n=3≥2, so k≥3, contradiction\\nSimilarly, no solution\\nSo likely no solutions when v_2(x) ≠ v_2(y)\\n\\nTherefore, must have v_2(x) = v_2(y) = a\\nThen as earlier, x = 2^a u, y = 2^a v, u,v odd, u>v≥1\\nThen x^n - y^n = 2^{n a} (u^n - v^n) = 2^{100}\\nSo u^n - v^n = 2^{100 - n a}\\nLet k = 100 - n a, so u^n - v^n = 2^k\\nk ≥1 since left side even (both odd, n≥1, difference even)\\nAlso, u>v≥1, so u≥v+1≥2, so u^n - v^n ≥ (v+1)^n - v^n ≥ n v^{n-1} ≥ n ≥2\\nSo 2^k ≥2, k≥1\\nNow, u and v odd positive integers, u>v, u^n - v^n = 2^k\\nThis is a well-known type.\\nFor n>1, when can the difference of two n-th powers be a power of 2?\\nKnown that the only solutions are small.\\nTry n=2: u^2 - v^2 = (u-v)(u+v) = 2^k\\nu and v odd, so u-v and u+v even, and both divisible by 2, and since u and v odd, u-v and u+v divisible by 2 but not by 4? No, for example u=3,v=1: u-v=2, u+v=4, product 8=2^3\\nu=5,v=3:25-9=16=2^4, u-v=2, u+v=8\\nu=5,v=1:25-1=24 not power of 2\\nu=7,v=1:49-1=48 no\\nu=7,v=3:49-9=40 no\\nu=7,v=5:49-25=24 no\\nu=9,v=7:81-49=32=2^5, u-v=2, u+v=16\\nu=17,v=15:289-225=64=2^6, u-v=2, u+v=32\\nPattern: when u-v=2, then u+v = 2^{k-1}, and since u = v+2, then (v+2)+v = 2v+2 = 2^{k-1}, so 2v+2 = 2^{k-1}, so v+1 = 2^{k-2}, so v = 2^{k-2} -1, u = 2^{k-2} +1\\nThen u^2 - v^2 = (u-v)(u+v) = 2 * (2^{k-1}) = 2^k, yes.\\nNow, are there other possibilities? Suppose u-v=4, then u+v must be 2^{k-2}, and u = v+4, so (v+4)+v = 2v+4 = 2^{k-2}, so v+2 = 2^{k-3}, v = 2^{k-3} -2, u = 2^{k-3} +2\\nThen u^2 - v^2 = (u-v)(u+v) = 4 * 2^{k-2} = 2^2 * 2^{k-2} = 2^k, yes.\\nBut v = 2^{k-3} -2, must be positive integer, so k≥4, and v≥1, so 2^{k-3} ≥3, k≥5? k=4: v=2^{1}-2=0, not positive\\nk=5: v=2^2 -2=4-2=2, even, but v must be odd! Contradiction.\\nSimilarly, for larger u-v, v may not be odd.\\nSuppose u-v=d, d even, d≥2, and d|2^k, so d=2^m for some m≥1\\nThen u+v = 2^{k-m}\\nAdding: 2u = 2^m + 2^{k-m}, so u = 2^{m-1} + 2^{k-m-1}\\nSimilarly, 2v = 2^{k-m} - 2^m, v = 2^{k-m-1} - 2^{m-1}\\nNow v must be positive integer, so 2^{k-m-1} > 2^{m-1}, so k-m-1 > m-1, i.e., k > 2m\\nAlso v must be odd, so the expression 2^{k-m-1} - 2^{m-1} must be odd, which requires that the exponents are such that one is zero or something, but since it's a difference of powers of 2, it's odd only if one of the terms is odd, i.e., exponent 0.\\nSo either k-m-1=0 or m-1=0\\nCase 1: m-1=0, so m=1\\nThen v = 2^{k-1-1} - 2^{1-1} = 2^{k-2} - 1\\nu = 2^{1-1} + 2^{k-1-1} = 1 + 2^{k-2}\\nNow v>0 requires k≥2, and v odd: 2^{k-2} -1, which is odd for k≥2\\nu = 1 + 2^{k-2}, also odd\\nAnd u>v since 1 + 2^{k-2} > 2^{k-2} -1 for k>1, which is true\\nThis is the case we had earlier with u-v=2^m=2^1=2\\nCase 2: k-m-1=0, so k=m+1\\nThen v = 2^{0} - 2^{m-1} = 1 - 2^{m-1}\\nFor m=1: v=1-1=0, not positive\\nm=2: v=1-2= -1<0\\nSo no solution\\nThus for n=2, only solutions when u-v=2, and u=1 + 2^{k-2}, v=2^{k-2} -1, for k≥2\\nv≥1 requires 2^{k-2} ≥2, so k≥3\\nk=3: v=2^{1}-1=1, u=1+2=3, as before\\nk=4: v=4-1=3, u=1+4=5? 25-9=16=2^4 yes\\nk=5: v=8-1=7, u=1+8=9, 81-49=32=2^5 yes\\netc.\\nNow back to our equation: u^n - v^n = 2^k, with k=100 - n a\\nFor n=2, we have solutions for each k≥3, with u and v as above.\\nBut n is fixed, and we need to count triples (x,y,n)\\nFor each n, and each a, we get a solution if u^n - v^n = 2^{100 - n a} has solution in odd u>v≥1\\nFor n=2: we need 2^k = u^2 - v^2 with u,v odd, which we have for each k≥3, with exactly one solution: u=2^{k-2} +1, v=2^{k-2} -1\\nIs it unique? From above, yes, only when u-v=2\\nSo for each k≥3, one pair (u,v)\\nNow k=100 - 2a, since n=2\\nk≥3, so 100 - 2a ≥3, so 2a ≤97, a≤48.5, so a≤48\\nAlso k=100-2a must be at least 3, and since u and v determined, and a integer ≥0\\nAlso, x=2^a u, y=2^a v, so for each a, we get a solution\\na from ? k=100-2a≥3, a≤48, and a≥0, but also v=2^{k-2} -1 ≥1, so 2^{k-2}≥2, k≥3, already have\\nk=100-2a, so k-2=98-2a\\nv=2^{98-2a} -1 ≥1, always for a≤48\\na≥0, but when a=48, k=100-96=4, k-2=2, v=4-1=3>0\\na=49: k=100-98=2<3, not allowed\\na=0: k=100, k-2=98, v=2^{98}-1, u=2^{98}+1, both odd, good\\nSo a from 0 to 48 inclusive\\nNumber of a: 49 values (0 through 48)\\nEach gives a unique (x,y) for n=2\\nSo 49 solutions for n=2\\n\\nNow n>2\\nFor n odd >1, or even >2\\nFirst, n=3\\nu^3 - v^3 = (u-v)(u^2 + uv + v^2) = 2^k\\nu,v odd, u>v≥1\\nu-v ≥2, even, since both odd\\nSet d=u-v≥2, even\\nThen u=v+d\\nThen u^2 + uv + v^2 = (v+d)^2 + (v+d)v + v^2 = v^2 + 2v d + d^2 + v^2 + v d + v^2 + wait\\nu^2 = (v+d)^2 = v^2 + 2v d + d^2\\nuv = v(v+d) = v^2 + v d\\nv^2 = v^2\\nSum: v^2 + 2vd + d^2 + v^2 + vd + v^2 = 3v^2 + 3v d + d^2\\nSo (u-v)(u^2 + uv + v^2) = d (3v^2 + 3v d + d^2) = 2^k\\nd even, d≥2, and 3v^2 + 3v d + d^2 is odd? v odd, d even\\n3v^2 odd, 3v d even, d^2 even, so odd + even + even = odd\\nSo the product is d * odd = 2^k\\nSince the second factor is odd, it must be 1, because it's an odd divisor of 2^k\\nSo 3v^2 + 3v d + d^2 =1\\nBut v≥1, d≥2, left side ≥ 3(1) + 3(1)(2) + 4 = 3+6+4=13>1, contradiction\\nSo no solution for n=3\\n\\nFor any odd n>1, u^n - v^n = (u-v) * (some polynomial)\\nAnd u-v even, and the second factor, when u and v odd, is sum of n terms, each u^{n-j} v^{j-1}, n odd, each term odd (since u,v odd), and there are n terms, n odd, so sum is odd\\nThus u^n - v^n = (u-v) * odd_number\\nAnd this equals 2^k, so the odd part must be 1\\nSo u^n - v^n = u-v\\nBut u^n - v^n > u-v for u>v≥1, n>1, since u^n - v^n ≥ u^2 - v^2 > u-v for u>v≥1? Not necessarily, but for example u=3,v=1,n=3:27-1=26, u-v=2, 26>2\\nIn general, u^n - v^n ≥ u^n - (u-1)^n ≥ n u^{n-1} - \\\\binom{n}{2} u^{n-2} + ... > u for u≥2, while u-v ≤ u-1 < u, so yes, u^n - v^n > u-v for u>v≥1, n>1\\nEquality only if v=0, but v≥1\\nSo strict inequality, so u^n - v^n > u-v, but we need = u-v, contradiction\\nThus for all odd n>1, no solutions\\n\\nNow even n>2\\nLet n be even, n≥4\\nu^n - v^n = 2^k\\nWith u,v odd, u>v≥1\\nNow, since n even, we can write as difference of squares: u^n - v^n = (u^{n/2})^2 - (v^{n/2})^2 = (u^{n/2} - v^{n/2})(u^{n/2} + v^{n/2})\\nBoth factors are even, since u^{n/2} and v^{n/2} odd (as u,v odd), so their sum and difference even\\nSet a = u^{n/2}, b = v^{n/2}, both odd integers, a>b≥1\\nThen a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b) = 2^k\\nSame as the n=2 case!\\nSo (a-b)(a+b) = 2^k\\na and b odd, so a-b and a+b even, and as before, for the product to be power of 2, and both even, we must have that the odd parts are 1, but earlier analysis shows that only when a-b=2, and a+b=2^{k-1}, etc.\\nFrom earlier, for two odd integers, a^2 - b^2 = 2^k implies that a-b=2, a+b=2^{k-1}, so 2a = 2 + 2^{k-1}, a = 1 + 2^{k-2}, b = 2^{k-2} -1, for k≥3\\nAnd this is the only solution\\nSo a = u^{n/2} = 1 + 2^{k-2}, b = v^{n/2} = 2^{k-2} -1\\nNow, u and v are integers, so u^{n/2} must be integer, which it is, but we need that 1 + 2^{k-2} is a perfect (n/2)-th power, and similarly for the other\\nSet m = n/2 ≥2 since n≥4\\nSo we need u^m = 1 + 2^{k-2}, v^m = 2^{k-2} -1\\nNow, v^m = 2^{k-2} -1\\nFor m≥2, when is 2^{c} -1 a perfect m-th power?\\nKnown that the only solution to x^m - y^l =1 for m,l>1 is 3^2 - 2^3 =1, but here it's 2^c - v^m =1, so v^m = 2^c -1\\nSolutions to v^m = 2^c -1\\nFor m=2: v^2 = 2^c -1, so 2^c - v^2 =1, which is Pell equation\\nSolutions: c=1:2-1=1=1^2, v=1\\nc=2:4-1=3 not square\\nc=3:8-1=7 no\\nc=4:16-1=15 no\\nc=5:32-1=31 no\\nc=6:64-1=63 no\\nc=7:128-1=127 no\\nc=8:256-1=255 no\\nc=9:512-1=511 no\\nc=10:1024-1=1023 no\\nBut c=1: v=1\\nAre there others? 2^c - v^2 =1, so v^2 +1 =2^c\\nSolutions: v=1,c=1:1+1=2=2^1\\nv=3:9+1=10 no\\nv=5:25+1=26 no\\nv=7:49+1=50 no\\nv=0:1=2^c, c=0 not positive\\nSo only solution is v=1,c=1\\nBut c=k-2, so k-2=1, k=3\\nThen v^m = 2^{1} -1 =1, so v=1 (since v>0)\\nThen u^m =1 + 2^{1} =3\\nSo u^m =3\\nFor m≥2, u≥2, 2^2=4>3, so no integer u\\nThus no solution for m=2\\nFor m>2, v^m =2^{k-2} -1\\nv≥1, if v=1, then 1=2^{k-2} -1, so 2^{k-2}=2, k-2=1, k=3\\nThen u^m =1 + 2^{1} =3\\nu^m=3, no integer u for m≥2\\nIf v≥2, then v^m ≥ 2^m ≥ 2^3=8 for m≥3\\nSo 2^{k-2} -1 ≥8, 2^{k-2}≥9, k-2≥4, k≥6\\nNow, is 2^c -1 a perfect m-th power for m≥3?\\nIt is known that the only perfect powers differing by 1 are 8 and 9, i.e., 2^3 and 3^2\\nSo 2^c - v^m =1 only when c=3,v=2,m=3: 8-8=0? No, 2^c - v^m =1\\n2^3 - 2^3 =0, not 1\\n2^c - v^m =1\\nSolutions: c=1,v=1,m any: 2-1=1, but v=1\\nc=2:4-1=3, not m-th power for m>1\\nc=3:8-1=7 no\\nBut 3^2 - 2^3 =9-8=1, so v^m - 2^c =1, opposite\\nHere we have 2^c - v^m =1\\nSo v^m = 2^c -1\\nFor c=1:1=1^m\\nc=2:3, not m-th power\\nc=3:7 no\\nc=4:15 no\\nc=5:31 no\\nc=6:63 no\\nc=7:127 no\\nc=8:255 no\\nc=9:511 no\\nc=10:1023 no\\nc=0:0, not positive\\nAnd it's a known result that the only solution in integers greater than 1 is none; in fact, Mihăilescu's theorem implies that the only solution to |x^a - y^b| =1 for a,b>1, x,y>1 is 3^2 - 2^3 =1\\nHere, if m≥2, c≥2, v≥2, then |2^c - v^m|=1, so only possibility is 2^c - v^m = ±1\\n+1: 2^c = v^m +1\\n-1: 2^c = v^m -1\\nThe latter: v^m - 2^c =1, which has solution v=3,m=2,c=3:9-8=1\\nBut we have 2^c - v^m =1, so v^m = 2^c -1\\nIs there a solution? 2^c - v^m =1\\nFor example, c=3,v=2,m=3:8-8=0≠1\\nc=2,v=1,m=2:4-1=3≠1\\nEarlier only v=1,c=1:2-1=1, but c=1<2\\nSo no solutions for v≥2, m≥2, c≥2\\nThus the only possibility is v=1, but then as before, leads to u^m=3, no solution for m≥2\\nTherefore, for even n≥4, no solutions\\n\\nBut what about n=1? n>1, so excluded\\nSo only solutions are for n=2, with a from 0 to 48, giving 49 solutions\\n\\nBut in each case, for n=2, we have a solution\\nk=100 - 2a, and k≥3, a≤48, a≥0 integer\\na=0: k=100, v=2^{98}-1, u=2^{98}+1\\nx=2^0 u=2^{98}+1, y=2^{98}-1\\nx^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y) = (2)(2^{99}) = 2^{100}, yes\\na=48: k=100-96=4, v=2^{2}-1=3, u=2^{2}+1=5? Earlier u=1 + 2^{k-2}=1+2^{2}=5, v=4-1=3\\nx=2^{48} *5, y=2^{48}*3\\nx^2 - y^2 = 2^{96} (25 - 9) = 2^{96} * 16 = 2^{96} * 2^4 = 2^{100}, yes\\na=49: k=100-98=2<3, not allowed, and indeed u^2 - v^2 = (u-v)(u+v), minimum when u=v+2, then (2)(2v+2)=4(v+1), for v≥1, ≥8=2^3, so cannot be 2^2=4, indeed\\nSo 49 solutions\\n\\nBut is that all? What if u=v? But u>v, since x>y\\nOr if y=0, but y positive integer, so y≥1\\n\\nBut in the beginning, we assumed v_2(x)=v_2(y), but we concluded no solutions otherwise\\nAnd for n>2, no solutions\\nBut n=2 is the only possibility\\n\\nBut n must divide something? No\\n\\nAnother thought: could n be such that n a =100, but in our case for n=2, n a =2a, which is less than 100, since k=100-2a≥3>0\\nBut what if k=0? Then u^n - v^n =2^0=1\\nSo u^n - v^n =1\\nWith u>v≥1, integers, n>1\\nThen by Mihăilescu's theorem, the only solution is u=3,v=2,n=2? 9-4=5≠1\\n3^2 - 2^3=9-8=1, but different exponents\\nHere same exponent n\\nSo u^n - v^n =1\\nFor n>1, u>v≥1, minimum is 2^n -1^n ≥4-1=3>1 for n≥2, or 3^2-2^2=9-4=5>1, so no solution\\nThus k≥1, but in our earlier, for n=2, k≥3\\nBut could k=1 or 2 for other n?\\nFor example, if n odd, we saw no solution\\nBut suppose n=100, and a=1, then k=100-100=0, u^{100} - v^{100}=1, no solution\\nOr a=0, k=100, u^n - v^n=2^{100}\\nFor large n, u must be close to v, but u>v, so u≥v+1, then u^n - v^n ≥ (v+1)^n - v^n ≥ n v^{n-1} \\nSet equal to 2^{100}\\nFor fixed v, as n increases, this grows, but v can be chosen\\nBut for n>100, say, (v+1)^n - v^n > 2^{100} for v≥2, but for v=1, (2)^n -1^n=2^n -1\\nSet equal to 2^{100}, so 2^n -1 = 2^{100}, so 2^n = 2^{100} +1, not a power of 2\\nSimilarly, no solution\\nBut in our earlier systematic approach, for n>2, we covered all cases and found no solutions\\n\\nBut for n even greater than 2, we assumed that the only way a^2 - b^2 = 2^k is with a-b=2, but is that true?\\nEarlier for two odd integers, a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b) = 2^k\\na-b and a+b both even, positive, a-b ≥2, a+b > a-b\\nSet d=a-b, s=a+b, d<s, d and s even, d s =2^k, and s - d = 2b >0, and a=(s+d)/2, b=(s-d)/2\\nSince d and s even, set d=2^p, s=2^q, with p+q=k, p≥1, q≥1, and since s>d, q>p\\nThen b=(s-d)/2 = (2^q - 2^p)/2 = 2^{q-1} - 2^{p-1}\\nMust be positive integer, so q>p, and since b must be odd? In our case, b=v^{n/2}, and v odd, so b odd\\nSo 2^{q-1} - 2^{p-1} must be odd\\nThis happens only if the smaller exponent is 0, i.e., p-1=0, so p=1\\nThen b=2^{q-1} - 2^{0} = 2^{q-1} -1\\nWhich is odd, yes\\nThen d=2^p=2^1=2\\ns=2^q\\nThen a=(s+d)/2 = (2^q + 2)/2 = 2^{q-1} +1\\nSame as before\\nAnd q>p=1, so q≥2\\nThen k=p+q=1+q, so q=k-1\\nThen b=2^{k-2} -1, a=2^{k-2} +1, same as before\\nAnd for b to be positive, 2^{k-2} >1, k>2, so k≥3\\nThus indeed, only solution is d=2, and k≥3\\nSo no other possibilities\\nTherefore, only solutions are for n=2, a=0 to 48, total 49 solutions\\n\\nBut each gives a triple (x,y,n), with n=2 fixed, x=2^a (2^{k-2} +1), y=2^a (2^{k-2} -1), k=100-2a\\nSince a determines k, and thus x and y, all distinct\\nSo 49 ordered triples\\n\\nBut is there a solution where x=y? But then difference 0, not 2^{100}\\nOr if n divides 100, but we think we covered\\n\\nAnother possible solution: what if y=0? But y positive integer, so y≥1, not allowed\\nOr if x=2^{50}, y=0, but y not positive\\n\\nOr perhaps when u=v, but not possible\\n\\nSo total 49 solutions\\n\\nBut let me confirm with small case\\nSuppose instead of 2^{100}, say 2^4=16\\nThen x^n - y^n=16, n>1\\nPossible?\\nn=2: x^2 - y^2=16, (x-y)(x+y)=16\\nx>y>0 integers\\nPossibilities: x-y=1, x+y=16 → x=17/2 no\\nx-y=2, x+y=8 → x=5,y=3, 25-9=16 yes\\nx-y=4, x+y=4 → x=4,y=0 not positive\\nSo only (5,3,2)\\nAccording to formula, n=2, k=4 - 2a, k≥3, so 4-2a≥3, 2a≤1, a≤0.5, a≥0 integer, so a=0\\nk=4, v=2^{4-2}-1=4-1=3, u=4+1=5, x=1*5=5,y=1*3=3, yes\\nNumber: a=0 only, so one solution\\nBut are there others?\\nn=4: x^4 - y^4=16\\nx>y≥1\\nx=2,y=0 not allowed\\nx=2,y=1:16-1=15≠16\\nx=3,y=1:81-1=80>16\\nx=3,y=2:81-16=65>16\\nNo\\nn=3: x^3-y^3=16\\nx=3,y=2:27-8=19>16\\nx=3,y=1:27-1=26>16\\nx=2,y=1:8-1=7<16\\nNo\\nn=5: larger\\nSo only one solution, matches a=0\\nNow for 2^3=8\\nx^n-y^n=8\\nn=2: x^2-y^2=8\\nx-y=2,x+y=4 → x=3,y=1,9-1=8 yes\\na: k=3-2a≥3, so 3-2a≥3, -2a≥0, a≤0, a≥0, so a=0\\nk=3, v=2^{1}-1=1, u=2+1=3, x=3,y=1, yes\\nOther n? n=3: x^3-y^3=8\\nx=2,y=0 no\\nx=2,y=1:8-1=7<8\\nx=3,y=2:27-8=19>8\\nNo\\nSo one solution\\nNow for 2^2=4\\nx^n-y^n=4\\nn=2: x^2-y^2=4\\nx-y=2,x+y=2 → x=2,y=0 not positive\\nx-y=1,x+y=4 → x=2.5 no\\nNo solution for n=2\\nOther n? n=3: x^3-y^3=4\\nx=2,y=1:8-1=7>4\\nx=1,y=1:0\\nNo\\nn=4:16-1=15>4, etc\\nNo solution\\nAccording to formula, for n=2, k=2-2a≥3? 2-2a≥3 ⇒ -2a≥1, a≤-0.5, not possible, so no solution, correct\\nNow for 2^5=32\\nn=2: k=5-2a≥3, so 5-2a≥3, 2a≤2, a≤1\\na=0: k=5, v=2^{3}-1=7, u=8+1=9, x=9,y=7, 81-49=32 yes\\na=1: k=5-2=3, v=2^{1}-1=1, u=2+1=3, x=2^1*3=6, y=2*1=2, 36-4=32 yes\\na=2: k=5-4=1<3, no\\nSo two solutions: (9,7,2),(6,2,2)\\nCheck: 81-49=32, 36-4=32, yes\\nNo others? n=5: x^5-y^5=32\\nx=2,y=1:32-1=31<32\\nx=2,y=0 no\\nx=3,y=2:243-32=211>32\\nNo\\nSo two solutions, and a=0,1, number is floor((5-3)/2)+1? k≥3, k=5-2a, so 5-2a≥3, a≤1, a≥0, so a=0,1, two values\\nIn general, for exponent E=100, n=2, k=E - 2a ≥3, so 2a ≤ E-3, a ≤ floor((E-3)/2)\\na≥0, so a=0,1,2,...,floor((E-3)/2)\\nNumber is floor((E-3)/2) +1\\nFor E=100, floor(97/2)=48, so 48+1=49\\nYes\\nNow, are there solutions for other n? For example, if n divides 100, but we think not\\nOne more: suppose n=100, a=1, then k=100-100=0, u^{100} - v^{100}=1, no solution\\nOr n=50, a=2, k=100-100=0, same\\nOr a=1, k=100-50=50, u^{50} - v^{50}=2^{50}\\nBut u>v≥1 odd, u≥3, then u^{50} ≥ 3^{50}, v^{50}≥1, difference huge, much larger than 2^{50}, since 3^{50} = (3^5)^{10}=243^{10} > 256^{10}=2^{80} > 2^{50}, and v^{50}≥1, so difference < 3^{50}, but 3^{50} >> 2^{50}, but could be equal? Unlikely, and from earlier analysis for even n>2, no solution because it reduces to v^m = 2^{k-2} -1 not a perfect power\\nSo no\\nThus only 49 solutions\\n\\nBut in the triple, (x,y,n), and n=2 for all, but x and y different\\nAll are distinct\\nSo answer is 49\\n\\nProblem 1: k=1\\nProblem 2: 49\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"49\"\n}",
