  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\n\\nWe are given a game with 5 players and 5 roles. Each player chooses 2 roles out of the 5, independently and uniformly at random. We are to count the number of favorable outcomes where each role is selected by exactly 2 players. Then compute e = T(favorable) - 1940.\\n\\nStep 1: Total number of ways each player can choose 2 roles from 5:\\nEach player selects a 2-element subset of the 5 roles. The number of such subsets is C(5,2) = 10. Since there are 5 players, the total number of possible role assignments (without any restriction) is 10^5. But we are not computing probability — we are counting the number of favorable assignments where each role is chosen exactly twice.\\n\\nLet the roles be R1, R2, R3, R4, R5.\\nEach player picks 2 roles → total of 5×2 = 10 role choices made across all players.\\nWe want each role to be chosen exactly 2 times → 5 roles × 2 = 10, so this matches.\\nSo we need to count the number of 5-tuples of 2-element subsets (one per player) such that each role appears in exactly two of the subsets.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of 5×2 binary matrices where:\\n- Each row has exactly two 1s (each player picks two roles)\\n- Each column has exactly two 1s (each role is picked by two players)\\n- Rows correspond to players (distinguishable), columns to roles (also distinguishable)\\n\\nThis is a combinatorics problem about regular bipartite graphs or 0-1 matrices with given row and column sums.\\n\\nAlternatively, think of it as a multiset assignment: we have 10 role selections (since 5 players × 2), and we want to assign them so that each role is selected twice.\\nBut each selection comes in pairs: each player contributes two roles.\\n\\nSo we are counting the number of 5-tuples (S1, S2, ..., S5), where each Si ⊆ {1,2,3,4,5}, |Si|=2, and every role j appears in exactly two of the Si.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to decomposing the complete multigraph where each vertex (role) has degree 2 into 5 edges (but actually, each Si is an unordered pair, and we’re assigning 5 such pairs, forming a 2-regular hypergraph? No — better: we are forming a 2-regular graph on the roles, but no, because each Si is a pair chosen by a player, and multiple players can pick same pair.\\n\\nActually, this is equivalent to a 2-regular multigraph on 5 vertices (roles), where each edge corresponds to a player's choice, and each player adds one edge (undirected) between two roles. So we are placing 5 undirected edges (with possible loops? No — choosing two distinct roles, so no loops) on 5 labeled vertices, such that each vertex has degree 2.\\n\\nWait: each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices. Total degree sum = 10 → number of edges = 5. So yes, we are counting the number of 2-regular multigraphs on 5 labeled vertices with 5 edges, but with the additional structure that the edges are distinguishable (because players are distinguishable).\\n\\nBut actually, the players are distinguishable, so the order of the 5 edges matters. So we are counting the number of sequences (e1,e2,...,e5) of unordered pairs from {1,2,3,4,5} (no loops), such that each vertex appears in exactly two of the ei.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the players are distinguishable, we can think of assigning to each player an unordered pair, such that the multiset of all endpoints forms a 2-regular graph (i.e., a disjoint union of cycles), and each vertex has degree 2.\\n\\nBut in graph theory, a 2-regular graph is a disjoint union of cycles. On 5 vertices, the only possibilities are:\\n- One 5-cycle\\n- A 3-cycle and a 2-cycle (but 2-cycle would require two edges between same pair, which is allowed if multiedges are allowed)\\n\\nBut wait: in our case, multiple players can choose the same pair, so multiedges are allowed.\\n\\nBut the degree is defined as the number of edge endpoints at a vertex. So if two players both choose the pair (1,2), then vertex 1 has degree 2 from those two edges, and similarly for 2.\\n\\nSo possible 2-regular configurations (up to isomorphism):\\n1. A single 5-cycle: uses 5 distinct edges forming a cycle.\\n2. A triangle (3-cycle) and a digon (2-cycle, i.e., two parallel edges between two vertices)\\n3. A 4-cycle plus a loop? No, no loops allowed — each player chooses two distinct roles.\\n4. A 3-cycle and two isolated edges? No, because then degrees won't be 2.\\nWait: total edges = 5, each vertex degree 2.\\n\\nThe graph must be 2-regular → disjoint union of cycles, each of length ≥3? No — a 2-cycle is allowed if we allow multiedges. But in simple graphs, minimum cycle length is 3, but here we allow multiple edges, so a 2-cycle (two edges between same pair) is allowed.\\n\\nSo possible cycle decompositions of 5 edges on 5 vertices with each vertex degree 2:\\n- One 5-cycle: 5 edges, 5 vertices, each degree 2\\n- One 3-cycle and one 2-cycle (the 2-cycle being two parallel edges between two vertices): uses 3+2=5 edges, and 3+2=5 vertices? Only if they are disjoint. But 3-cycle uses 3 vertices, 2-cycle uses 2 more → total 5 vertices. Yes.\\n- Could we have five self-loops? No, no loops allowed.\\n- Or a 4-cycle and a separate edge? But then the two vertices in the edge would have degree 1, unless it's a double edge.\\nIf we have a 4-cycle (4 edges, 4 vertices, each degree 2) and then one more edge: but we need to place one edge on the remaining vertex? Can't — one vertex left, can't form an edge without another vertex. So impossible.\\n- Three cycles? For example, two 2-cycles and a 1-cycle? Not possible.\\nOr a 2-cycle and three other edges? Doesn't work.\\nSo only two types:\\nType A: a 5-cycle (simple cycle, no repeated edges)\\nType B: a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle (double edge on a pair)\\n\\nNow, we need to count the number of ways to assign the 5 player choices (ordered list of 5 edges) such that the multiset of edges forms a 2-regular graph of one of these types, and then account for labeling.\\n\\nBut the players are distinguishable, so we are counting ordered 5-tuples of unordered pairs (i,j), i≠j, such that each vertex appears in exactly two pairs.\\n\\nApproach: Instead of classifying by graph type, use combinatorics.\\n\\nWe can model this as distributing 10 role selections (5 players × 2) such that each role gets exactly 2, and the selections are grouped into 5 pairs (each pair corresponding to a player's choice).\\n\\nSo: we have 10 slots: for each player, two role choices. But the two choices for a player are unordered, and the players are distinguishable.\\n\\nAlternative method: Use inclusion-exclusion or generating functions, but perhaps direct counting by configuration types is feasible.\\n\\nBetter approach: This is equivalent to counting the number of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with exactly two 1s per row (player chooses two roles) and exactly two 1s per column (each role chosen by two players). This is a regular bipartite graph: biregular with row sums 2, column sums 2.\\n\\nNumber of 5×5 (0,1)-matrices with row sums 2 and column sums 2.\\n\\nThis is a standard combinatorial object. The number of such matrices is equal to the number of 2-regular bipartite graphs between two sets of size 5, or equivalently, the number of 2-factors in K_{5,5}, but actually it's the number of perfect matchings in the line graph, but perhaps use formula.\\n\\nKnown result: The number of k-regular bipartite graphs can be computed, but for small n, we can use the formula involving permanents or just enumerate.\\n\\nAlternatively, this is the same as the number of ways to decompose the complete bipartite graph K_{5,5} into 2-factors, but no.\\n\\nActually, each such matrix corresponds to a bipartite multigraph with left side players (5), right side roles (5), each left vertex degree 2, each right vertex degree 2.\\n\\nBut since it's a simple graph (no multiple edges allowed? Wait: can a player choose the same role twice? No — each player chooses two distinct roles, so no multiple edges from a player to a role. So the bipartite graph has no multiple edges, and each player has degree 2, each role has degree 2.\\n\\nSo we are counting the number of 2-regular bipartite graphs with parts of size 5, i.e., 2-factors in K_{5,5}.\\n\\nA 2-regular graph is a disjoint union of cycles. In a bipartite graph, all cycles must be of even length.\\n\\nSo we need to decompose the bipartite graph into disjoint cycles covering all 10 vertices (5 players + 5 roles), each of even length ≥4.\\n\\nPossible cycle structures:\\n- One 10-cycle\\n- An 8-cycle and a 2-cycle? But 2-cycle not possible in simple bipartite graph (would require two edges between same pair, but also a 2-cycle means alternating between two vertices, which would be two players and two roles? No: a cycle must alternate between player and role. A 2-cycle would be P1-R1-P1, impossible. Minimum cycle length is 4.\\nSo possible partitions of 10 into even parts ≥4:\\n- 10\\n- 8+2 → invalid (2<4)\\n- 6+4\\n- 4+4+2 → invalid\\n- 4+6 → same as above\\n- 4+4+2 → invalid\\n- 4+3+3 → odd\\nSo only: 10, 6+4, 4+4+2? 4+4+2=10 but 2 invalid.\\n4+4+2 not allowed.\\nWhat about 4+3+3? Not even.\\nOr 5+5? But 5 is odd, not allowed in bipartite cycle.\\nSo only possibilities: 10-cycle, or 6-cycle and 4-cycle, or two 4-cycles and one 2-cycle? No, 4+4+2=10 but 2-cycle invalid.\\nThree cycles: 4+4+2 invalid, 4+3+3 invalid.\\nAnother possibility: three cycles: 4+4+2 no, or 6+4, or 8+2 no, or 4+6 same.\\nWhat about four cycles? 4+2+2+2 no.\\nOr five 2-cycles? No.\\nSo only two types: \\nType 1: a single 10-cycle\\nType 2: a 6-cycle and a 4-cycle\\nType 3: two 4-cycles and a 2-cycle? No.\\n4+4+2 not allowed.\\nBut 4+4+2 is 10, but 2-cycle impossible.\\nAnother: three cycles: for example, 4+4+2 no, or 6+2+2 no.\\nWait, 4+6 is one, 10 is one.\\nIs 4+4+2 possible? Only if we allow, but 2-cycle not possible.\\nBut what about two disjoint 4-cycles and then two vertices left? 4+4=8, 10-8=2 vertices, which could form a 2-cycle, but again, 2-cycle not possible.\\nSo only 10-cycle and 6+4-cycle.\\nBut 5+5? Odd cycle not allowed.\\nSo only two cases.\\n\\nBut wait: could we have a 4-cycle and another 4-cycle and a 2-cycle? No.\\nOr three cycles: say 4+4+2 no.\\nAnother possibility: a 4-cycle and three 2-cycles? No.\\nI think only 10 and 6+4.\\nBut let me confirm: total vertices 10, even, so possible.\\n\\nCase 1: one 10-cycle\\nCase 2: one 6-cycle and one disjoint 4-cycle\\n\\nAre there any others? What about two 4-cycles and one 2-cycle? Still 2-cycle invalid.\\nOr a 8-cycle and a 2-cycle? Invalid.\\nSo only two types.\\n\\nNow, count the number of such bipartite graphs (i.e., the adjacency matrices) for each type.\\n\\nFirst, recall that the two parts are: players P1..P5 and roles R1..R5.\\n\\nCase 1: Single 10-cycle.\\nIn a bipartite graph, a cycle must alternate between P and R. So a 10-cycle visits 5 P's and 5 R's in alternation.\\nNumber of ways to arrange the cycle.\\nFirst, number of ways to write a cyclic sequence alternating P and R.\\nFix starting point: say start with a player. There are 5 choices for the first player.\\nThen the sequence is P - R - P - R - ... - P - R, and back to first P.\\nSince it's a cycle, we can fix the first player to avoid overcounting rotations. But in counting labeled graphs, we need to count the number of distinct cycles.\\nStandard way: number of directed cycles.\\nBut since the graph is undirected, each cycle can be traversed in two directions, and we can start at any point.\\nBetter: the number of ways to choose a cyclic ordering.\\nTotal number of ways to arrange the 5 players and 5 roles in a circle, alternating, up to rotation and direction?\\nNo, for counting the number of distinct cycle subgraphs, we need the number of distinct cycles as subgraphs.\\n\\nFor a cycle of length 2k in a bipartite graph with parts of size m,n, but here k=5, m=n=5.\\nGeneral formula: number of Hamiltonian cycles in K_{5,5}.\\n\\nIn K_{m,m}, number of Hamiltonian cycles.\\nEach Hamiltonian cycle visits all vertices, alternating between the two parts.\\nNumber of ways: choose an ordering of the first part: 5! ways to order the players.\\nChoose an ordering of the second part: 5! ways to order the roles.\\nThen the cycle is P1-R1-P2-R2-...-P5-R5-P1.\\nBut this counts directed cycles, and also fixes the starting point and direction.\\nIn this construction, each directed cycle is counted once for each starting point? No.\\nIn this sequence, we have a fixed starting player P1, and fixed direction.\\nBut in reality, for a cycle, we can start at any of the 10 vertices, and go in two directions.\\nBut in our construction, we fixed the starting player (P1) and the order.\\nActually, in this method, we have specified a directed cycle: starting at P1, to R1, to P2, etc.\\nHow many times do we count each undirected cycle?\\nEach undirected cycle can be traversed in 2 directions.\\nAnd for each direction, we can start at any of the 5 players (since it alternates, starting at a player).\\nSo 5 starting players × 2 directions = 10 ways to represent the same cycle in this enumeration.\\nTherefore, the number of distinct undirected Hamiltonian cycles is (5! * 5!) / 10 = (120 * 120) / 10 = 14400 / 10 = 1440.\\n\\nBut is that correct? Let me verify with smaller case.\\nSuppose 2 players, 2 roles. K_{2,2} has how many Hamiltonian cycles? It should have one cycle: P1-R1-P2-R2-P1 and P1-R2-P2-R1-P1, but these are the same cycle if undirected? No, in K_{2,2}, there is only one 4-cycle, since it's a complete bipartite, and any cycle uses all edges? No, K_{2,2} has 4 edges, a 4-cycle uses 4 edges, but there is only one undirected cycle (up to the labels).\\nWith labels: vertices P1,P2,R1,R2.\\nThe cycle can be P1-R1-P2-R2-P1 or P1-R2-P2-R1-P1. These are different if the roles are labeled.\\nActually, these are two different cycles? No, in an undirected graph, P1-R1-P2-R2-P1 is the same as P1-R2-P2-R1-P1 only if we relabel, but with fixed labels, they are different if R1 and R2 are distinct.\\nIn fact, for K_{2,2}, there are two different Hamiltonian cycles: one using edges (P1,R1),(R1,P2),(P2,R2),(R2,P1) — but wait, the edges are between P and R, so the cycle is determined by the order.\\nFrom P1, go to R1, then to P2, then to R2, back to P1: this uses edges P1R1, P2R1? No: from R1 to P2 is edge R1P2, which is same as P2R1.\\nBut in this path: P1 -R1-> P2 -R2-> P1? From P2 to R2, then back to P1, so edges: P1R1, P2R1? No: when we go from P1 to R1, then from R1 to P2, so edge between R1 and P2, then from P2 to R2, edge P2R2, then from R2 to P1, edge R2P1.\\nSo edges used: P1R1, P2R1, P2R2, P1R2? That's all four edges, but a cycle should use only four edges, but in K_{2,2}, there are only four edges, and they form a single 4-cycle? Actually, K_{2,2} is itself a 4-cycle if we consider the complete graph, but with two players and two roles, K_{2,2} has four edges, and it is a complete bipartite, which is a 4-cycle only if it's a cycle, but actually K_{2,2} is isomorphic to C4, the cycle of length 4.\\nAnd there is only one undirected cycle that visits all vertices, but since it's the whole graph, there is only one such cycle subgraph.\\nBut in terms of edge set, there is only one set of four edges, but a cycle is determined by the sequence.\\nFor counting the number of distinct cycle subgraphs, in K_{2,2}, there is only one 4-cycle (the whole graph), but when we consider directed cycles, there are two: clockwise and counterclockwise.\\nBut for our purpose, when we say the graph has a 10-cycle, we mean that the edge set forms a single cycle.\\nIn the adjacency matrix, we care about which edges are present, not the direction.\\nSo for the 10-cycle case, we need the number of ways to have a single cycle that includes all 10 vertices.\\nEach such cycle corresponds to a 2-factor consisting of one cycle.\\n\\nBack to formula: in K_{m,m}, the number of undirected Hamiltonian cycles is (m-1)! * m! / 2.\\nWhy? Fix a starting vertex, say P1. Choose the next vertex (a role): m choices. Then choose the next player: m-1 choices (since can't go back immediately, but in a cycle, after R, we go to a different P). After P1 -> R_j, then from R_j we go to some P_k ≠ P1, so m-1 choices. Then from P_k to some R_l ≠ R_j, so m-1 choices, and so on.\\nBut it's messy.\\nStandard formula: number of Hamiltonian cycles in K_{m,m} is \\\\frac{1}{2} m! (m-1)! .\\nFor m=2: \\\\frac{1}{2} * 2! * 1! = \\\\frac{1}{2} * 2 * 1 = 1.\\nAnd indeed, in K_{2,2}, there is only one undirected Hamiltonian cycle (since it's C4, and only one cycle up to the graph).\\nBut earlier I thought there might be more, but with labeled vertices, is there only one? No: for example, the cycle P1-R1-P2-R2-P1 is different from P1-R2-P2-R1-P1? But in an undirected graph, these are the same cycle if we reverse direction, but as sets of edges, both use all four edges, so the edge set is the same. In K_{2,2}, there is only one set of edges that forms a 4-cycle, which is all edges, and it forms a single cycle. So only one such subgraph.\\nYes, so for m=2, number is 1.\\nFormula gives 1, good.\\nFor m=3: \\\\frac{1}{2} * 6 * 2 = 6.\\nCheck: K_{3,3}, number of Hamiltonian cycles. Fix P1, then choose first role: 3 choices. Then next player: 2 choices (not P1). Then next role: 2 choices (not the first role, because if we go back, it might not complete). From the second player, go to a new role: 2 choices (since one role already used). Then from that role, go to the last player: 1 choice. Then from last player, go to the last role: 1 choice, then back to P1. But this counts directed cycles, and we have fixed the starting point P1.\\nSo number of directed cycles starting and ending at P1: 3 (first role) * 2 (second player) * 2 (second role) * 1 (third player) * 1 (third role) = 3*2*2=12.\\nBut each directed cycle is counted once for each starting point, but we fixed P1, so this is for fixed start.\\nSince we fixed the starting vertex P1, and the cycle is directed, each directed cycle is counted once (when we start at P1).\\nThere are 6 directed cycles? 12 seems too much.\\nAfter P1 -> R_a, then from R_a to P_b (b≠1), 2 choices. Then from P_b to R_c (c≠a), 2 choices. Then from R_c to P_c (the last player), 1 choice. Then from P_c to R_d, but only one role left, say R_d, then from R_d back to P1.\\nSo yes, 3*2*2*1*1 = 12 directed cycles starting at P1.\\nBut each directed cycle has 6 vertices, so 6 possible starting points. But since we have fixed P1 as start, and the cycle must include P1, each directed cycle is counted once for each of its 6 starting points, but in our count, we only start at P1, so we should have number of directed cycles = number we have = 12, but each directed cycle is associated with 6 starting points, so total number of directed cycles should be (number of directed cycles) * 6 / 6 = wait.\\nWhen we fix the starting vertex as P1, and list the sequence, each directed cycle that includes P1 (all do) will be counted exactly once in this enumeration, because we start at P1.\\nSo there are 12 directed Hamiltonian cycles in K_{3,3}.\\nThen, since each undirected cycle corresponds to two directed cycles, the number of undirected Hamiltonian cycles is 12 / 2 = 6.\\nWhich matches the formula \\\\frac{1}{2} * 3! * 2! = \\\\frac{1}{2} * 6 * 2 = 6.\\nGood.\\nSo general formula: number of undirected Hamiltonian cycles in K_{m,m} is \\\\frac{1}{2} m! (m-1)! .\\nFor m=5, number is \\\\frac{1}{2} * 5! * 4! = \\\\frac{1}{2} * 120 * 24 = \\\\frac{1}{2} * 2880 = 1440.\\nSo 1440 such cycles.\\nBut this is the number of cycle subgraphs, i.e., the number of ways the edge set forms a single 10-cycle.\\nIn our case, for the bipartite graph, each such cycle corresponds to a specific set of 10 edges? No, a cycle of length 10 has 10 edges.\\nBut in our bipartite graph, each player has degree 2, so total edges 10, yes.\\nAnd for a 10-cycle, it uses exactly 10 edges, and is 2-regular.\\nSo each such cycle subgraph is a valid configuration for case 1.\\nBut is that the only thing? No, because in this count, we have the edge set, but in our problem, the players are distinguishable, and the edge set determines who is connected to whom, but in this case, for a given cycle, the adjacency is fixed.\\nMoreover, in this count of 1440, each is a different edge set (different cycle), so different adjacency matrices.\\nSo for case 1, there are 1440 such bipartite graphs that are a single 10-cycle.\\n\\nCase 2: a 6-cycle and a 4-cycle, disjoint, covering all vertices.\\nSo we partition the 5 players into two sets: one of size 3 for the 6-cycle, one of size 2 for the 4-cycle? A 6-cycle in bipartite graph has 3 players and 3 roles, a 4-cycle has 2 players and 2 roles.\\nTotal players: 3+2=5, roles: 3+3=6>5, impossible.\\nOh! Mistake.\\nA cycle of length l in a bipartite graph has l/2 vertices in each part.\\nSo a 6-cycle has 3 players and 3 roles.\\nA 4-cycle has 2 players and 2 roles.\\nTotal players needed: 3+2=5, good.\\nTotal roles needed: 3+2=5, good.\\nYes, possible.\\n\\nSo we need to choose which 3 players and which 3 roles are in the 6-cycle, the remaining 2 players and 2 roles in the 4-cycle.\\n\\nNumber of ways:\\n- Choose 3 players out of 5 for the 6-cycle: C(5,3) = 10\\n- Choose 3 roles out of 5 for the 6-cycle: C(5,3) = 10\\n- The remaining 2 players and 2 roles automatically go to the 4-cycle.\\n\\nNow, for the 6-cycle part: number of undirected Hamiltonian cycles in K_{3,3} for the selected vertices.\\nFrom earlier, for m=3, it is \\\\frac{1}{2} * 3! * 2! = \\\\frac{1}{2} * 6 * 2 = 6.\\nSimilarly, for the 4-cycle part: K_{2,2}, number of undirected Hamiltonian cycles is \\\\frac{1}{2} * 2! * 1! = \\\\frac{1}{2} * 2 * 1 = 1.\\n\\nSo for each such partition, number of ways: 6 (for 6-cycle) * 1 (for 4-cycle) = 6.\\n\\nThus total for case 2: 10 * 10 * 6 = 600.\\n\\nBut is that correct? When we choose the sets, and then put cycles on them, and since the cycles are on disjoint vertex sets, the total graph is the disjoint union.\\n\\nSo total number of such bipartite graphs: case 1 + case 2 = 1440 + 600 = 2040.\\n\\nBut is that all? Earlier I thought only these two, but let me confirm if there are more.\\nAnother possibility: three cycles? For example, a 4-cycle and two 3-cycles? But 3-cycle not possible in bipartite graph (odd length).\\nOr a 8-cycle and a 2-cycle? 2-cycle impossible.\\nOr a 4-cycle and a 6-cycle, which we have.\\nOr two 4-cycles and a 2-cycle? But 4+4+2=10, but 2-cycle impossible, and also would require 2+2=4 players for two 4-cycles, but 4<5, and 2-cycle needs 1 player? No, a 2-cycle would need two vertices, but in bipartite, minimum 4.\\nCould we have a 4-cycle and then another 4-cycle, but that would be 8 vertices, leaving 2 vertices (one player, one role), which can't form a cycle.\\nOr a 6-cycle and two 2-cycles? No.\\nSo only the two cases.\\n\\nBut in case 2, when we have a 6-cycle and a 4-cycle, is there any overcount? I don't think so.\\n\\nSo total number of 2-regular bipartite graphs (i.e., adjacency matrices with row sums 2, column sums 2) is 1440 + 600 = 2040.\\n\\nBut is this the number of graphs or the number of matrices? Each such graph corresponds to a unique adjacency matrix, since no multiple edges.\\nYes.\\n\\nHowever, in our problem, this adjacency matrix represents: for each player, which roles they chose. Specifically, if there is an edge between player i and role j, it means player i chose role j.\\nAnd since each player has degree 2, each chose two roles, and each role has degree 2, so chosen by two players.\\nPerfect.\\n\\nSo T(favorable) = 2040.\\n\\nBut the problem asks for e = T(favorable) - 1940.\\nSo e = 2040 - 1940 = 100.\\n\\nBut let me double-check the calculation.\\nCase 1: 10-cycle: \\\\frac{1}{2} * 5! * 4! = 0.5 * 120 * 24 = 0.5 * 2880 = 1440, ok.\\nCase 2: choose 3 players out of 5: C(5,3)=10\\nChoose 3 roles out of 5: C(5,3)=10\\nFor the 3 players and 3 roles: number of 6-cycles: as above, 6\\nFor the remaining 2 players and 2 roles: number of 4-cycles: in K_{2,2}, only one undirected cycle (the whole graph), and it is a 4-cycle, so yes, 1.\\nSo 10*10*6*1=600\\nTotal: 1440+600=2040\\nT(favorable)=2040\\ne=2040-1940=100\\n\\nBut is there any other configuration? For example, could there be a graph that is not a disjoint union of cycles but still 2-regular? In a simple graph, 2-regular means disjoint union of cycles, so no.\\nAnd we covered all cycle type decompositions.\\n\\nAnother way to compute the number of 5x5 (0,1)-matrices with row sums 2, column sums 2.\\nThis is known as the number of semi-regular bipartite graphs or can be computed via formula.\\nI recall that the number is given by the coefficient of x^2 y^2 z^2 w^2 v^2 in (x+y+z+w+v)^5 for the rows, but perhaps use permanent or other methods.\\nStandard combinatorial number: the number of such matrices is equal to the number of 2-factors, but we can look up or compute.\\nI know that for n=5, k=2, the number is 2040, and I've seen it before, so probably correct.\\n\\nSo e=100.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nGiven k, ||k|| is the absolute difference between k and the nearest perfect square.\\nFor example, ||13||=3, since nearest squares are 9 and 16, |13-9|=4, |13-16|=3, min is 3.\\nWe need the smallest n such that the average of ||1|| to ||n|| is 100, i.e., sum_{k=1}^n ||k|| / n = 100, so sum = 100n.\\n\\nLet s(n) = sum_{k=1}^n ||k||.\\nWe need s(n) = 100n.\\n\\nNote that between consecutive squares, the behavior of ||k|| is symmetric.\\nLet m^2 be a perfect square. Consider the interval [m^2, (m+1)^2].\\nThe length is 2m+1.\\nFor k from m^2 to (m+1)^2, the nearest square: \\n- For k close to m^2, nearest is m^2\\n- For k close to (m+1)^2, nearest is (m+1)^2\\n- The midpoint is at m^2 + m + 0.5, so for k <= m^2 + m, nearest is m^2 if k - m^2 <= (m+1)^2 - k, i.e., 2k <= m^2 + (m+1)^2 = 2m^2 + 2m +1, so k <= m^2 + m + 0.5, so since k integer, k <= m^2 + m.\\nSimilarly, for k >= m^2 + m + 1, nearest is (m+1)^2.\\nAt k=m^2 + m, distance to m^2 is m, to (m+1)^2 is (m+1)^2 - (m^2 + m) = m^2 + 2m +1 - m^2 - m = m+1 > m, so nearer to m^2.\\nAt k=m^2 + m +1, dist to m^2 is m+1, to (m+1)^2 is (m+1)^2 - (m^2 + m +1) = m^2 + 2m +1 - m^2 - m -1 = m, so nearer to (m+1)^2.\\nSo indeed, for k from m^2 to m^2 + m, ||k|| = k - m^2\\nFor k from m^2 + m +1 to (m+1)^2, ||k|| = (m+1)^2 - k\\nAnd at k=(m+1)^2, ||k||=0, but usually we include up to (m+1)^2 -1 for the interval, but (m+1)^2 is the start of next.\\nActually, the interval for m is from m^2 to (m+1)^2 - 1, but (m+1)^2 is handled in the next.\\nBut at k=(m+1)^2, ||k||=0, which is fine.\\nBut in the range [m^2, (m+1)^2], we have:\\n- k = m^2: ||k||=0\\n- k = m^2 +1: ||k||=1\\n- ...\\n- k = m^2 + m: ||k||=m\\n- k = m^2 + m +1: ||k||=m\\n- k = m^2 + m +2: ||k||=m-1\\n- ...\\n- k = (m+1)^2 -1: ||k||=1\\n- k = (m+1)^2: ||k||=0\\nBut k=(m+1)^2 is the start of the next interval.\\nSo for the open interval (m^2, (m+1)^2), but to avoid overlap, we can define for each m>=1, the interval I_m = [m^2, (m+1)^2) , but since integers, k from m^2 to (m+1)^2 - 1.\\nLength: (m+1)^2 - m^2 = 2m+1.\\nIn this interval, k from m^2 to m^2 + m: ||k|| = k - m^2\\nk from m^2 + m +1 to (m+1)^2 -1: ||k|| = (m+1)^2 - k\\nNote that m^2 + m +1 to (m+1)^2 -1 = m^2 + 2m +1 -1 = m^2 + 2m, so from m^2 + m +1 to m^2 + 2m.\\nAnd the value at k=m^2 + m is m, and at k=m^2 + m +1 is m, as above.\\nNow, the sum over I_m: sum_{k=m^2}^{(m+1)^2 -1} ||k||\\n= sum_{j=0}^{m} ||m^2 + j|| + sum_{j=m+1}^{2m} ||m^2 + j||\\nFor j=0 to m: ||m^2 + j|| = j\\nFor j=m+1 to 2m: ||m^2 + j|| = (m+1)^2 - (m^2 + j) = m^2 + 2m +1 - m^2 - j = 2m+1 - j\\nSo sum = sum_{j=0}^m j + sum_{j=m+1}^{2m} (2m+1 - j)\\nFirst sum: sum_{j=0}^m j = 0 + 1 + ... + m = m(m+1)/2\\nSecond sum: let i = j - (m+1), then j from m+1 to 2m, i from 0 to m-1\\n2m+1 - j = 2m+1 - (i + m +1) = 2m+1 - i - m -1 = m - i\\nSo sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (m - i) = sum_{k=1}^{m} k  (letting k=m-i) = m(m+1)/2? No\\ni=0: m, i=1: m-1, ..., i=m-1: m-(m-1)=1\\nSo sum = m + (m-1) + ... + 1 = m(m+1)/2\\nSame as first sum.\\nSo total sum for I_m = m(m+1)/2 + m(m+1)/2 = m(m+1)\\nNow, this is for k from m^2 to (m+1)^2 -1, inclusive.\\nNumber of terms: 2m+1\\nSum = m(m+1)\\nNow, what about k=0? But k starts from 1, and 1=1^2, so for m=1, I_1: k from 1^2=1 to 2^2 -1=3\\nSum = 1*(1+1)=2\\nCompute: k=1: ||1||=0 (nearest square 1)\\nk=2: dist to 1 is 1, to 4 is 2, so min=1\\nk=3: dist to 1 is 2, to 4 is 1, so min=1\\nSum: 0+1+1=2, yes.\\nFor m=2: k from 4 to 8? (2+1)^2 -1=9-1=8\\nSum=2*3=6\\nk=4:0, k=5:1, k=6:2, k=7: dist to 4 is 3, to 9 is 2, so 2? But according to formula, k=4 to 4+2=6: ||k||=k-4, so k=4:0,5:1,6:2\\nk=7: m^2 + m +1=4+2+1=7, so ||k||=(3)^2 -7=9-7=2\\nk=8:9-8=1\\nSum:0+1+2+2+1=6, yes.\\nGood.\\nNow, for m=0? k=0, but we start from k=1, so skip.\\nNow, the intervals: I_1: k=1,2,3\\nI_2: k=4,5,6,7,8\\nI_3: k=9 to 15? (3+1)^2 -1=16-1=15\\nSum=3*4=12\\nk=9:0,10:1,11:2,12:3,13: dist to 9 is 4, to 16 is 3, so 3; k=14:16-14=2, k=15:1, sum:0+1+2+3+3+2+1=12, yes.\\nNow, s(n) = sum_{k=1}^n ||k||\\nWe can sum over complete intervals up to some m, and then add the partial interval.\\nLet M be such that M^2 <= n < (M+1)^2\\nThen s(n) = sum_{m=1}^{M-1} sum_{k in I_m} ||k|| + sum_{k=M^2}^{n} ||k||\\nsum_{m=1}^{M-1} m(m+1) = sum_{m=1}^{M-1} (m^2 + m) = sum m^2 + sum m = (M-1)M(2M-1)/6 + (M-1)M/2\\n= (M-1)M [ (2M-1)/6 + 1/2 ] = (M-1)M [ (2M-1 + 3)/6 ] = (M-1)M (2M+2)/6 = (M-1)M * 2(M+1)/6 = (M-1)M(M+1)/3\\nNow, for the last part, from k=M^2 to n.\\nAs above, for k in [M^2, M^2 + M], ||k|| = k - M^2\\nFor k in [M^2 + M +1, (M+1)^2 -1], ||k|| = (M+1)^2 - k\\nNow, n >= M^2, and n < (M+1)^2\\nCase 1: if n <= M^2 + M, then sum_{k=M^2}^n ||k|| = sum_{j=0}^{n - M^2} j = (n - M^2)(n - M^2 + 1)/2\\nCase 2: if n >= M^2 + M +1, then we have sum from k=M^2 to M^2 + M: sum_{j=0}^M j = M(M+1)/2\\nPlus sum from k=M^2 + M +1 to n: ||k|| = (M+1)^2 - k\\nLet j = k - (M^2 + M +1), then k = M^2 + M +1 + j, j from 0 to n - (M^2 + M +1)\\n||k|| = (M+1)^2 - (M^2 + M +1 + j) = M^2 + 2M +1 - M^2 - M -1 - j = M - j\\nSo sum_{j=0}^{n - M^2 - M -1} (M - j)\\nLet d = n - M^2 - M -1, then sum_{j=0}^d (M - j) = sum_{i=M-d}^{M} i ? Better: sum_{j=0}^d (M - j) = (d+1)M - sum_{j=0}^d j = (d+1)M - d(d+1)/2 = (d+1)(M - d/2)\\nOr = (d+1)M - d(d+1)/2 = (d+1)(2M - d)/2\\nNow d = n - M^2 - M -1\\nSo total sum for last part: M(M+1)/2 + (d+1)(2M - d)/2\\nWith d = n - M^2 - M -1\\nWe need s(n) = 100n\\nAnd find smallest such n.\\nSince s(n) grows like integral of distance, roughly quadratic, and 100n is linear, but s(n) is approximately c n^{3/2} or something? Let's see the growth.\\nFrom the sum, for large M, s((M+1)^2 -1) = sum_{m=1}^M m(m+1) = sum_{m=1}^M (m^2 + m) ≈ ∫_1^M x^2 dx = M^3/3\\nWhile n = (M+1)^2 -1 ≈ M^2, so s(n) ≈ M^3/3 ≈ n^{3/2} / 3, while 100n is linear, so for large n, s(n)/n → ∞, so there will be a solution.\\nWe need s(n)/n = 100, so s(n) = 100n\\ns(n) ≈ c n^{3/2}, so c n^{3/2} = 100 n ⇒ c n^{1/2} = 100 ⇒ n^{1/2} ≈ 100 / c\\nc ≈ 1/3, so n^{1/2} ≈ 300, n≈90000\\nSo around 90,000.\\nWe can compute for M around 300, since M^2 ≈ 90000.\\nSet M such that M^2 ≈ n, and s(n) ≈ M^3 / 3, set equal to 100 M^2, so M/3 ≈ 100, M≈300.\\nSo try M=300.\\nFirst, compute s(n) for n just below (M+1)^2.\\nBut we need exact.\\nLet M be the largest integer such that M^2 <= n.\\nAssume that n is large, around 90000.\\nTry M=300.\\nThen n >= 300^2 = 90000\\nn < 301^2 = 90601\\nNow, s(n) = sum_{m=1}^{299} m(m+1) + sum_{k=90000}^{n} ||k||\\nFirst, sum_{m=1}^{299} m(m+1) = sum_{m=1}^{299} (m^2 + m) = sum m^2 + sum m = \\frac{299 \\cdot 300 \\cdot 599}{6} + \\frac{299 \\cdot 300}{2}\\nCompute:\\nFirst, sum m^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 for n=299\\n299*300*599 / 6\\nFirst, 299/1, 300/6=50, so 299 * 50 * 599\\n299*50=14950\\n14950*599\\n599=600-1, so 14950*600 - 14950*1 = 8,970,000 - 14,950 = 8,955,050\\nSum m = 299*300/2 = 299*150 = 44,850\\nSo total sum_{m=1}^{299} = 8,955,050 + 44,850 = 8,999,900\\nNow, this is s((300)^2 - 1) = s(89999)\\nNow, for k from 90000 to n, which is in I_{300}, since M=300.\\nNow, M^2 + M = 90000 + 300 = 90300\\nM^2 + M +1 = 90301\\nNow, n < 301^2 = 90601\\nWe need to see if n <= 90300 or n >= 90301.\\nNow, s(n) = s(89999) + sum_{k=90000}^n ||k||\\nsum_{k=90000}^n ||k|| depends on n.\\nWe need s(n) = 100n\\ns(89999) = 8,999,900\\nFor n >= 90000, s(n) = 8,999,900 + sum_{k=90000}^n ||k||\\nSet equal to 100n\\nSo 8,999,900 + sum_{k=90000}^n ||k|| = 100n\\nThus sum_{k=90000}^n ||k|| = 100n - 8,999,900\\nNow, for k from 90000 to n, if n <= 90300, then ||k|| = k - 90000, since in [M^2, M^2 + M]\\nSo sum_{k=90000}^n (k - 90000) = sum_{j=0}^{n-90000} j = \\frac{(n-90000)(n-90000+1)}{2}\\nSet equal to 100n - 8,999,900\\nLet d = n - 90000, so d >=0, and if d <= 300, then\\n\\frac{d(d+1)}{2} = 100(90000 + d) - 8,999,900 = 9,000,000 + 100d - 8,999,900 = 100 + 100d\\nSo \\frac{d(d+1)}{2} = 100d + 100\\nMultiply both sides by 2: d(d+1) = 200d + 200\\nd^2 + d - 200d - 200 = 0\\nd^2 - 199d - 200 = 0\\nDiscriminant: 199^2 + 800 = 39601 + 800 = 40401\\nsqrt(40401), let me see: 201^2=40401, yes, because 200^2=40000, 201^2=40000+400+1=40401.\\nSo d = [199 ± 201]/2\\nd = (199+201)/2 = 400/2=200, or d=(199-201)/2=-2/2=-1\\nd=200\\nNow, d=200 <=300, so valid.\\nSo n = 90000 + 200 = 90200\\nNow, check if s(n) = 100n\\ns(n) = s(89999) + sum_{k=90000}^{90200} ||k||\\nsum = \\frac{200 * 201}{2} = 20100\\ns(89999)=8,999,900\\nTotal s(n)=8,999,900 + 20,100 = 9,020,000\\n100n=100*90200=9,020,000\\nEqual!\\nNow, is this the smallest? We assumed n <= 90300, and d=200<300, so yes.\\nBut is there a smaller n? This is for M=300, but perhaps for smaller M, there is a solution.\\nWe need to check if for smaller n, s(n)=100n.\\nBut s(n)/n is increasing for large n, but let's see the behavior.\\nNote that s(n) is non-decreasing, and 100n is linear, but s(n) grows faster than linear, so s(n)/n may have a minimum, but likely increases for large n.\\nWe can check for M=299.\\nLet M=299.\\nThen n >= 299^2 = 89401\\nn < 300^2 = 90000\\ns(n) = sum_{m=1}^{298} m(m+1) + sum_{k=89401}^n ||k||\\nFirst, sum_{m=1}^{298} m(m+1) = sum m^2 + sum m = \\frac{298*299*597}{6} + \\frac{298*299}{2}\\nCompute:\\nSum m^2 = 298*299*597 / 6\\nFirst, 298/2=149, 6/2=3, so 149 * 299 * 597 / 3\\nBetter: 298/2=149, 6/2=3, but 298 and 6 divisible by 2: 298÷2=149, 6÷2=3, so (149 * 299 * 597) / 3\\nNow 597 ÷ 3 = 199, so 149 * 299 * 199\\nNow compute 149*199 = 149*(200-1)=29800-149=29651\\nThen 29651*299 = 29651*(300-1)=29651*300 - 29651=8,895,300 - 29,651=8,865,649\\nSum m = 298*299/2 = 149*299 = 149*(300-1)=44,700-149=44,551\\nTotal sum_{m=1}^{298} = 8,865,649 + 44,551 = 8,910,200\\nThis is s(89400)? s((299)^2 -1) = s(89400)? 299^2=89401, so s(89400) = sum up to k=89400.\\nBut our sum is up to m=298, which covers k up to 299^2 -1 = 89400? 299^2=89401, so (299)^2 -1=89400, yes.\\nSo s(89400) = 8,910,200\\nNow for k from 89401 to n, in I_{299}, M=299.\\nM^2 + M = 89401 + 299 = 89700\\nM^2 + M +1 = 89701\\nn < 90000\\nWe need s(n) = 100n\\ns(n) = s(89400) + sum_{k=89401}^n ||k|| = 8,910,200 + sum\\nSet equal to 100n\\nSo sum_{k=89401}^n ||k|| = 100n - 8,910,200\\nIf n <= 89700, then ||k|| = k - 89401 for k in [89401, 89700]\\nSo sum_{k=89401}^n (k - 89401) = sum_{j=0}^{n-89401} j = \\frac{d(d+1)}{2} where d=n-89401\\nSet equal to 100n - 8,910,200 = 100(89401 + d) - 8,910,200 = 8,940,100 + 100d - 8,910,200 = 29,900 + 100d\\nSo \\frac{d(d+1)}{2} = 100d + 29,900\\nMultiply by 2: d(d+1) = 200d + 59,800\\nd^2 + d - 200d - 59,800 = 0\\nd^2 - 199d - 59,800 = 0\\nDiscriminant: 199^2 + 4*59800 = 39601 + 239200 = 278801\\nsqrt(278801), let me see: 528^2=278784, 529^2=279841, 278784 + 17 = 278801? 528^2= (500+28)^2=250000+2*500*28+28^2=250000+28000+784=278784\\n278801 - 278784=17, not square. sqrt(278801) ≈ 528.016, not integer.

Compute: 8,955,050 + 30,000 = 8,985,050 minus 5,050 = 8,980,000\\n100n=100*89800=8,980,000, yes.\\nBut n=89800 < 90200, and s(n)=100n, so smaller than previous.\\nBut is this valid? We assumed n >= 89701, and 89800 > 89701, yes.\\nBut earlier for M=300, we got n=90200, but now for M=299, we have n=89800 and n=89999.\\nBut n=89800 < 90200, so smaller.\\nBut is there even smaller?\\nWe have two solutions: n=89800 and n=89999 for M=299, and n=90200 for M=300.\\nBut n=89800 is smaller.\\nBut we need to check if there are solutions for smaller M.\\nMoreover, at n=89800, s(n)=8,980,000, 100n=8,980,000, good.\\nBut is there a smaller n?\\nNow, check for M=298.\\nM=298, n >= 298^2=88804, n<299^2=89401\\ns(n) = sum_{m=1}^{297} m(m+1) + sum_{k=88804}^n ||k||\\nFirst, sum_{m=1}^{297} m(m+1) = sum m^2 + sum m = \\frac{297*298*595}{6} + \\frac{297*298}{2}\\nCompute:\\nSum m^2 = 297*298*595 / 6\\n297/3=99, 6/3=2, so (99 * 298 * 595) / 2\\n298/2=149, so 99 * 149 * 595\\nFirst, 99*149=99*(150-1)=14850-99=14751\\nThen 14751*595=14751*(600-5)=14751*600 - 14751*5=8,850,600 - 73,755=8,776,845\\nSum m = 297*298/2 = 297*149=297*(150-1)=44,550-297=44,253\\nTotal sum_{m=1}^{297} = 8,776,845 + 44,253 = 8,821,098\\nThis is s(88803)? s((298)^2 -1)=s(88803)\\n298^2=88804, so s(88803)=8,821,098\\nNow for k from 88804 to n.\\nM=298, M^2 + M=88804+298=89102\\nM^2 + M +1=89103\\nn<89401\\nCase n <= 89102: sum_{k=88804}^n (k-88804) = \\frac{d(d+1)}{2}, d=n-88804\\nSet equal to 100n - 8,821,098 = 100(88804 + d) - 8,821,098 = 8,880,400 + 100d - 8,821,098 = 59,302 + 100d\\nSo \\frac{d(d+1)}{2} = 100d + 59,302\\nd(d+1) = 200d + 118,604\\nd^2 -199d -118,604=0\\nDiscriminant: 199^2 + 4*118604=39601 + 474416=514017\\nsqrt(514017)≈716.9, 717^2=514089>514017, 716^2=512656, 514017-512656=1361, not square. So no integer solution.\\nNow if n >= 89103, then sum = sum to 89102 + sum from 89103 to n\\nSum to 89102: d=89102-88804=298, sum=298*299/2=44,551\\nThen sum_{k=89103}^n ||k|| = sum_{j=1}^{d} (89401 - k)? Nearest square: for k>=89103, dist to 88804? k-88804, to 89401? 89401-k\\nAt k=89103, dist to 88804=299, to 89401=298, so nearer to 89401.\\n||k||=89401 - k\\nSo sum_{k=89103}^n (89401 - k) = sum_{j=1}^{d} (89401 - (89102 + j))? k=89102 + j? Set k from 89103 to n, let j=k-89102, j=1 to n-89102\\n||k||=89401 - k = 89401 - (89102 + j) = 299 - j\\nSo sum_{j=1}^d (299 - j) where d=n-89102\\n= sum_{j=1}^d (299 - j) = 299d - d(d+1)/2\\nTotal sum from k=88804 to n: 44,551 + 299d - d(d+1)/2\\ns(n) = s(88803) + this = 8,821,098 + 44,551 + 299d - d(d+1)/2 = 8,865,649 + 299d - d(d+1)/2\\nSet to 100n = 100(89102 + d) = 8,910,200 + 100d\\nSo:\\n8,865,649 + 299d - d(d+1)/2 = 8,910,200 + 100d\\nLeft - right: 8,865,649 - 8,910,200 + 299d - 100d - d(d+1)/2 = -44,551 + 199d - d(d+1)/2 = 0\\nMultiply by 2: -89,102 + 398d - d^2 - d = 0\\n- d^2 + 397d - 89,102 = 0\\nd^2 - 397d + 89,102 = 0\\nDiscriminant: 397^2 - 4*89102 = 157609 - 356408 = negative? 157609 - 356408 <0, impossible.\\n397^2= (400-3)^2=160000-2400+9=157609\\n4*89102=356408\\n157609 < 356408, so discriminant negative, no real solution.\\nSo no solution for M=298.\\nNow for M=299, we have solutions at n=89800 and n=89999.\\nSmallest is n=89800.\\nBut is there for M<299?\\nWe checked M=298, no solution.\\nBut M=299 gives n=89800, which is greater than 298^2=88804, so we need to check M=297, etc., but likely no, since s(n)/n may be less.\\nTo be safe, note that for n=89800, s(n)=8,980,000, average=100.\\nNow, is there any n<89800 with s(n)=100n?\\nSuppose there is, then for that n, let M be such that M^2 <= n < (M+1)^2.\\nSince for M=298, we had no solution, and for M<298, n < 299^2=89401 < 89800, so we need to check if for some M<=298, there is solution with n<89800.\\nBut for M=298, we already checked and no solution.\\nFor M=297, n<298^2=88804<89800, and we can compute, but likely s(n)/n <100 for smaller n.\\nNote that s(n) is convex, and s(n)/n may decrease initially but eventually increase.\\nWe can check the value at n=89800 is exactly 100, and for smaller n, perhaps less.\\nBut to confirm, let's see s(n) for n near 89800.\\nBut since we have an exact solution at n=89800, and the function s(n) is stepwise linear, but increases by ||n|| at each step, while 100n increases by 100.\\n||n|| is generally small compared to 100 for large n, but varies.\\nSpecifically, at n=89800, which is in M=299, and k=89800, M^2 + M =88804+298? M=299? Earlier for n=89800, M=299 since 299^2=89401 <=89800<90000=300^2.\\nAnd 89800 > 89701? M^2 + M +1=89401+299+1=89701, yes 89800>89701, so in the second part, ||k||=90000 - k\\nSo at k=89800, ||k||=90000-89800=200\\nNow, s(n) - s(n-1) = ||n||\\n100n - 100(n-1) = 100\\nSo the difference s(n) - 100n = [s(n-1) + ||n||] - [100(n-1) + 100] = [s(n-1) - 100(n-1)] + (||n|| - 100)\\nSo the increment in the difference is ||n|| - 100\\nAt n=89800, ||n||=200, so increment is 200-100=100>0\\nBut at the solution, s(n) - 100n =0\\nFor n<89800, if s(n) - 100n <0, and since increment can be positive or negative, but we need to see if it hits zero earlier.\\nBut we already checked for M=299, and the equation gave us n=89800 and n=89999, and for n<89701, no solution, and for n>=89701, we solved and got only these two.\\nIn the range n>=89701, we had d^2 -399d +29900=0? Earlier for M=299, n>=89701, we had d^2 -399d +29900=0? No.\\nEarlier: we had d^2 -399d +29,900=0? No.\\nRecall:\\nWe had d^2 - 399d + 29,900 = 0? From earlier calculation:\\nWe had d^2 - 399d + 29,900 = 0? No:\\nFrom: d^2 - 399d + 29,900 = 0? Earlier I wrote d^2 - 399d + 29,900 = 0, but in the text I had d^2 - 399d + 29,900 = 0, but discriminant was 39601, roots 299 and 100.\\nd=100 and d=299, so n=89700+100=89800, n=89700+299=89999.\\nAnd for n<89701, we had no solution in the first part.\\nSo only solutions for M=299 are n=89800 and n=89999.\\nNow, are there solutions for higher M? We have n=90200 for M=300.\\nBut 89800 is smaller.\\nNow, is there any solution for M<299? We checked M=298, no solution.\\nFor M=297, let's quickly check.\\nM=297, n<298^2=88804\\ns(n) = sum_{m=1}^{296} m(m+1) + sum_{k=88209}^n ||k||  (297^2=88209)\\nsum_{m=1}^{296} m(m+1) = sum m^2 + sum m = \\frac{296*297*593}{6} + \\frac{296*297}{2}\\nThis is less than for M=298, and n<88804, while 100n < 100*88804=8,880,400\\nBut sum_{m=1}^{296} is about sum up to m=296, similar to before, around 8.7e6, but let's not compute, since even if there were a solution, n<88804<89800, but we need to see if s(n)=100n.\\nBut from the pattern, s(n) for n=88804 is s(88803) + ||88804||, but earlier for M=298, s(88803)=8,821,098, and 100*88803=8,880,300, which is larger than s(88803), so s(n) < 100n for n=88803.\\nSimilarly, at n=89800, it equals, and before that, likely less.\\nTo confirm, at n=89700, which is in M=299, k=89700, since M^2 + M=89401+299=89700, so ||k||=k - M^2=89700-89401=299\\ns(n) for n=89700: s(89400) + sum_{k=89401}^{89700} ||k|| = 8,910,200 + sum_{j=0}^{299} j = 8,910,200 + 299*300/2 = 8,910,200 + 44,850 = 8,955,050\\n100n=100*89700=8,970,000\\n8,955,050 < 8,970,000, so s(n) < 100n\\nThen at n=89701, ||n||=90000-89701=299? 90000-89701=299\\ns(n)=s(89700) + 299 = 8,955,050 + 299 = 8,955,349\\n100n=8,970,100\\nStill less.\\nThen s(n) increases by ||n|| each time, which for n from 89701 to 89999, ||n||=90000-n, which decreases from 299 to 1.\\nWhile 100n increases by 100 each time.\\nSo s(n) - 100n increases by ||n|| - 100 each step.\\nAt n=89701, ||n||=299, so increment = 299-100=199>0\\nSo s(n)-100n increases by 199, from 8,955,349 - 8,970,100 = -14,751 to -14,751 + 199 = -14,552? The difference delta_n = s(n) - 100n\\ndelta_{n} = delta_{n-1} + ||n|| - 100\\nAt n=89700, delta = 8,955,050 - 8,970,000 = -14,950\\nAt n=89701, delta = -14,950 + 299 - 100 = -14,950 + 199 = -14,751\\nThen n=89702, ||n||=298, delta = -14,751 + 298 - 100 = -14,751 + 198 = -14,553\\nAnd so on, decreasing in magnitude but still negative.\\nIt increases by ||n|| - 100, which is positive since ||n|| >=1 for n not square, and at n=89701, ||n||=299>100, and decreases as n increases, but remains positive until ||n|| <100.\\n||n||=90000-n, so when 90000-n <100, i.e., n>89900\\nFor n from 89701 to 89900, ||n|| >=100, so ||n|| -100 >=0, so delta_n is non-decreasing.\\nAt n=89900, ||n||=100, so increment=0\\ndelta_n = delta_{89899} + 100 - 100 = delta_{89899}\\nBut we need to compute when it reaches zero.\\nFrom earlier solution, at n=89800, it should be zero.\\nSince we solved the equation and got n=89800 as solution, and it satisfies, and for n<89800, since the increment ||n|| -100 >0 for n<89900, and delta_n is increasing, and at n=89700, delta=-14,950<0, and it increases to 0 at n=89800, so for n<89800, delta_n <0, so s(n)<100n, so no solution before.\\nSimilarly, after that it becomes positive, but we have another solution at n=89999.\\nBut since we want the smallest n, it is n=89800.\\nNow, confirm the calculation.\\nFor n=89800, M=299, since 299^2=89401 <=89800<90000\\nk=89800 > 89701 = M^2 + M +1, so ||k||= (M+1)^2 - k = 90000 - 89800 = 200\\nBut we need sum.\\ns(n) = s(89400) + sum_{k=89401}^{89800} ||k||\\ns(89400) = sum_{m=1}^{298} m(m+1) = as computed earlier for M=299 case, but earlier we had for sum up to m=298: when we computed for M=299, s(89400) = sum_{m=1}^{298} m(m+1)\\nIn the M=299 section, we computed sum_{m=1}^{298} = 8,910,200? Earlier for M=299, we said sum_{m=1}^{298} = 8,910,200, but that was for the sum up to m=298, which is correct.\\nThen sum from k=89401 to 89800.\\nFirst, from k=89401 to 89700: this is j=0 to 299, ||k||=j, sum= sum_{j=0}^{299} j = 299*300/2 = 44,850\\nThen from k=89701 to 89800: j=1 to 100? k from 89701 to 89800, that's 100 terms.\\n||k||=90000 - k\\nk=89701: ||k||=299\\nk=89702:298\\n...\\nk=89800:200\\nSo values from 299 down to 200, inclusive.\\nThis is an arithmetic series: first term 299, last term 200, number of terms: 89800 - 89701 + 1 = 100\\nSum = (number of terms) * (first + last)/2 = 100 * (299 + 200)/2 = 100 * 499 / 2 = 100 * 249.5 = 24,950\\nSo total sum from k=89401 to 89800: 44,850 + 24,950 = 69,800\\nThen s(n) = s(89400) + 69,800 = 8,910,200 + 69,800 = 8,980,000\\n100n = 100 * 89800 = 8,980,000, yes.\\nPerfect.\\nNow, is there any smaller n? Suppose n=89799, then s(n)=s(89800) - ||89800|| = 8,980,000 - 200 = 8,979,800\\n100n=100*89799=8,979,900\\n8,979,800 < 8,979,900, so s(n) < 100n\\nAnd since for n<89800, as we saw delta_n <0, so no smaller solution.\\nThus the smallest n is 89800.\\n\\nSo answer to problem 1: e=100\\nAnswer to problem 2: n=89800\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"100\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"89800\"\n}",
