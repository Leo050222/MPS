We're told to find $ \\\\ell = m - 95 $, so our goal is to determine $ m $, then compute $ \\\\ell = m - 95 $.\\n\\nLet’s denote the modulus as $ m $. We want to find $ m $ such that there exist positive integers $ a, b $ satisfying both congruences.\\n\\nLet’s treat this as a linear system modulo $ m $. We can eliminate one variable.\\n\\nMultiply the first equation by 4:\\n\\n$$\\n12a + 20b \\\\equiv 76 \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\n\\nMultiply the second equation by 3:\\n\\n$$\\n12a + 6b \\\\equiv 75 \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\n\\nNow subtract:\\n\\n$$\\n(12a + 20b) - (12a + 6b) \\\\equiv 76 - 75 \\\\pmod{m} \\\\Rightarrow 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\n\\nThis implies that $ 14b - 1 $ is divisible by $ m $, i.e., $ m \\\\mid (14b - 1) $.\\n\\nSimilarly, we can eliminate $ b $ from the original equations.\\n\\nMultiply first equation by 2: $ 6a + 10b \\\\equiv 38 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nMultiply second equation by 5: $ 20a + 10b \\\\equiv 125 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nSubtract:\\n\\n$$\\n(20a + 10b) - (6a + 10b) \\\\equiv 125 - 38 \\\\pmod{m} \\\\Rightarrow 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\n\\nNow we have:\\n\\n- $ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n- $ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nLet’s now consider combining these to get $ 2a + 6b $.\\n\\nWe want $ 2a + 6b \\\\pmod{m} $, but actually we want the value of $ 2a + 6b $, not modulo anything — but since $ a, b $ are integers and the congruences are mod $ m $, the actual value of $ 2a + 6b $ could be any representative unless constrained.\\n\\nBut here's the key: $ m $ must divide $ 14b - 1 $, so $ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} \\\\Rightarrow b \\\\equiv 14^{-1} \\\\pmod{m} $, so 14 must be invertible mod $ m $, meaning $ \\\\gcd(14, m) = 1 $.\\n\\nSimilarly, $ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m} $, so once we know $ m $, we can solve for $ a $ and $ b $.\\n\\nBut we don't know $ m $, but we are to find $ \\\\ell = m - 95 $, so perhaps $ m > 95 $, and we can find possible $ m $ dividing $ 14b - 1 $, and also consistent with $ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m} $.\\n\\nBut recall: $ a, b $ are positive integers. Let’s suppose that $ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $, so $ 14b - 1 = km $ for some integer $ k $. Since $ b \\\\geq 1 $, $ 14b - 1 \\\\geq 13 $, so $ m \\\\leq 14b - 1 $.\\n\\nBut we want to find $ m $ such that the system has solutions. However, notice that from:\\n\\n- $ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n- $ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nThen multiply the first by 6: $ 84b \\\\equiv 6 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nMultiply the second by 2: $ 28a \\\\equiv 174 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nWait, we want $ 2a + 6b $. Let’s compute $ 2a + 6b $ directly.\\n\\nLet $ x = 2a + 6b $. Can we express this in terms of the given equations?\\n\\nOriginal equations:\\n\\n(1) $ 3a + 5b \\\\equiv 19 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\n(2) $ 4a + 2b \\\\equiv 25 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nTry to write $ 2a + 6b $ as a linear combination.\\n\\nSuppose $ x \\\\cdot (3a+5b) + y \\\\cdot (4a+2b) = 2a + 6b $\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$ (3x + 4y)a + (5x + 2y)b = 2a + 6b $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$ 3x + 4y = 2 $\\n\\n$ 5x + 2y = 6 $\\n\\nSolve this system:\\n\\nFrom first: $ 3x + 4y = 2 $\\n\\nSecond: $ 5x + 2y = 6 $ → multiply by 2: $ 10x + 4y = 12 $\\n\\nSubtract first: $ (10x + 4y) - (3x + 4y) = 12 - 2 \\\\Rightarrow 7x = 10 \\\\Rightarrow x = 10/7 $, not integer.\\n\\nNot helpful for integer combination.\\n\\nAlternative idea: use the two expressions we found:\\n\\nWe have:\\n\\n$ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\n$ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$ 2a \\\\equiv \\\\frac{2}{14} \\\\cdot 87 = \\\\frac{174}{14} = \\\\frac{87}{7} \\\\pmod{m} $? No, not valid.\\n\\nBetter: from $ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m} $, so $ 2a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\cdot 7^{-1} \\\\pmod{m} $? Not helpful.\\n\\nBut let’s compute $ 2a + 6b $ using the known congruences.\\n\\nWe have:\\n\\n$ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m} \\\\Rightarrow 2a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\cdot 7^{-1} \\\\pmod{m} $? Still messy.\\n\\nInstead, note:\\n\\nLet’s suppose we compute $ 2a + 6b $ directly from the values.\\n\\nBut we don’t know $ a, b $, only modulo relations.\\n\\nHowever, since $ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $, then $ b \\\\equiv 14^{-1} \\\\pmod{m} $, so $ b $ is the modular inverse of 14 mod $ m $, provided $ \\\\gcd(14, m) = 1 $.\\n\\nSimilarly, $ a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\cdot 14^{-1} \\\\pmod{m} $.\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$ 2a + 6b \\\\equiv 2(87 \\\\cdot 14^{-1}) + 6(14^{-1}) = (174 + 6) \\\\cdot 14^{-1} = 180 \\\\cdot 14^{-1} \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$ 2a + 6b \\\\equiv 180 \\\\cdot 14^{-1} \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nBut $ 2a + 6b $ is an integer, say $ k $, and $ k \\\\equiv 180 \\\\cdot 14^{-1} \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nBut we need the actual value of $ 2a + 6b $, not just modulo $ m $. However, unless $ m $ is large, $ 2a + 6b $ might be small.\\n\\nBut here's a better idea: since $ a, b $ are positive integers, and the right-hand sides are 19 and 25, which are not too large, likely $ 3a + 5b $ and $ 4a + 2b $ are close to 19 and 25, or at least their remainders mod $ m $ are 19 and 25. So if $ m > 19 $ and $ m > 25 $, then:\\n\\n$ 3a + 5b = 19 + r_1 m $\\n\\n$ 4a + 2b = 25 + r_2 m $\\n\\nfor some integers $ r_1, r_2 \\\\geq 0 $.\\n\\nBut if $ m $ is large, then $ r_1 = r_2 = 0 $, so:\\n\\n$ 3a + 5b = 19 $\\n\\n$ 4a + 2b = 25 $\\n\\nTry solving this system over integers.\\n\\nFrom first: $ 3a + 5b = 19 $\\n\\nSecond: $ 4a + 2b = 25 $\\n\\nMultiply first by 2: $ 6a + 10b = 38 $\\n\\nMultiply second by 5: $ 20a + 10b = 125 $\\n\\nSubtract: $ 14a = 87 \\\\Rightarrow a = 87/14 \\\\approx 6.214 $, not integer.\\n\\nSo no integer solution with $ r_1 = r_2 = 0 $.\\n\\nTry $ r_1 = 1 $: $ 3a + 5b = 19 + m $\\n\\n$ 4a + 2b = 25 + s m $\\n\\nBut too many variables.\\n\\nBack to earlier result:\\n\\nWe had:\\n\\n$ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\n$ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nSo $ 14b - 1 $ is divisible by $ m $, so $ m \\\\mid (14b - 1) $\\n\\nSimilarly, $ m \\\\mid (14a - 87) $\\n\\nSince $ a, b $ are positive integers, try small values of $ b $ and see when $ 14b - 1 $ has a divisor $ m $ such that the other congruence holds.\\n\\nTry $ b = 1 $: $ 14(1) - 1 = 13 $, so $ m \\\\mid 13 $, $ m = 1 $ or 13. But $ m = n+1 $, and $ n $ is answer, likely positive, so $ m \\\\geq 2 $. Try $ m = 13 $.\\n\\nCheck if $ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{13} $: $ 14 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{13} $, $ b=1 $, so $ 1*1 = 1 \\\\equiv 1 $, yes.\\n\\nNow $ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{13} $\\n\\n$ 14 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{13} $, $ 87 \\\\div 13 = 6*13=78, remainder 9, so $ 87 \\\\equiv 9 \\\\pmod{13} $\\n\\nSo $ a \\\\equiv 9 \\\\pmod{13} $\\n\\nNow check original equations mod 13:\\n\\nFirst: $ 3a + 5b \\\\equiv 3*9 + 5*1 = 27 + 5 = 32 \\\\equiv 32 - 2*13 = 32 - 26 = 6 \\\\pmod{13} $, but should be 19 mod 13 = 6. 19 - 13 = 6, yes!\\n\\nSecond: $ 4a + 2b = 4*9 + 2*1 = 36 + 2 = 38 \\\\equiv 38 - 2*13 = 38 - 26 = 12 \\\\pmod{13} $, should be 25 mod 13 = 25 - 13*1 = 12, yes!\\n\\nSo it works for $ m = 13 $, $ a \\\\equiv 9 \\\\pmod{13} $, $ b = 1 $\\n\\nBut $ a $ is positive integer, say $ a = 9 $, $ b = 1 $\\n\\nThen $ 3a + 5b = 27 + 5 = 32 $, $ 32 \\\\mod 13 = 32 - 2*13 = 32 - 26 = 6 $, but should be 19 mod 13 = 6, yes.\\n\\nBut 19 mod 13 is 6, so the congruence is satisfied, but the actual value is 32, which is fine.\\n\\nNow, $ n $ is the answer to the problem, and $ n $ satisfies that the modulus is $ n+1 = m = 13 $, so $ n = 12 $.\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"let $ n $ be the answer to this problem\\\", so if $ n = 12 $, then $ m = n+1 = 13 $, which matches.\\n\\nNow we are to find $ \\\\ell = m - 95 = 13 - 95 = -82 $\\n\\nBut is this the only possibility? Maybe there are larger $ m $.\\n\\nFor example, $ b = 2 $: $ 14*2 - 1 = 28 - 1 = 27 $, so $ m \\\\mid 27 $, $ m = 3,9,27 $\\n\\nTry $ m = 27 $: $ 14b = 28 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{27}? 28 - 1 = 27, yes, 28 ≡ 1 mod 27, so yes.\\n\\nNow $ 14a ≡ 87 mod 27 $\\n\\n14a ≡ 87 mod 27\\n\\n87 div 27: 3*27=81, 87-81=6, so 87≡6\\n\\n14a ≡ 6 mod 27\\n\\nDivide by 2: 7a ≡ 3 mod 27? Not necessarily, gcd 2 and 27 coprime, but better solve 14a ≡ 6 mod 27\\n\\nDivide equation by gcd(14,6)=2, but modulus becomes 27/gcd(2,27)=27, no: to divide congruence, divide modulus by gcd only if divides.\\n\\ngcd(14,27)=1, so inverse exists.\\n\\nOr simplify: 14a ≡ 6 mod 27 → divide by 2: 7a ≡ 3 mod 27? Is this valid? 14a - 6 = 27k → 2(7a - 3) = 27k, so 27k even, so k even, say k=2m, then 7a - 3 = 27m, so 7a ≡ 3 mod 27.\\n\\nNow solve 7a ≡ 3 mod 27\\n\\nInverse of 7 mod 27: find x such that 7x≡1 mod 27\\n\\n7*4=28≡1, yes, so a≡3*4=12 mod 27\\n\\nSo a≡12 mod 27\\n\\nNow check original equations mod 27:\\n\\nFirst: 3a + 5b = 3*12 + 5*2 = 36 + 10 = 46 ≡ 46 - 27 = 19? 46 - 27 = 19, yes! 46 ≡ 19 mod 27? 46 - 19 = 27, yes, exactly.\\n\\nSecond: 4a + 2b = 4*12 + 2*2 = 48 + 4 = 52 ≡ 52 - 27*1 = 25? 52 - 27 = 25, yes! 52 ≡ 25 mod 27.\\n\\nPerfect. So for m=27, a=12, b=2, it works.\\n\\nThen n = m - 1 = 26, but n is supposed to be the answer, but now we have another solution.\\n\\nBut the problem says \\\"let n be the answer to this problem\\\", implying that n is uniquely determined.\\n\\nBut here we have multiple possible m: 13, 27, etc.\\n\\nTry b=3: 14*3 -1 = 42-1=41, prime, so m=41\\n\\nThen 14b=42≡1 mod 41? 42-1=41, yes.\\n\\n14a≡87 mod 41\\n\\n87 mod 41: 2*41=82, 87-82=5\\n\\n14a≡5 mod 41\\n\\nSolve: inverse of 14 mod 41. gcd(14,41)=1\\n\\nExtended euclid: 41 = 2*14 + 13, 14=1*13+1, 13=13*1+0, so gcd=1\\n\\n1=14-13=14-(41-2*14)=3*14 -41\\n\\nSo 3*14≡1 mod 41, inverse is 3\\n\\na≡5*3=15 mod 41\\n\\na=15, b=3\\n\\nCheck first equation: 3a+5b=45+15=60 ≡60-41=19? 60-41=19, yes.\\n\\nSecond: 4a+2b=60+6=66≡66-41=25? 66-41=25, yes.\\n\\nAgain works. So m=41 also works.\\n\\nPattern: m divides 14b-1, and for b=1, m|13; b=2, m|27; b=3, m|41; but in each case we took m=14b-1.\\n\\nAnd it works because:\\n\\nFrom earlier derivation, we had 14b≡1 mod m, so if m=14b-1, then 14b≡1 mod m, good.\\n\\nAnd 14a≡87 mod m\\n\\nBut from the construction, when we plug in, it satisfied the original equations only because we derived them from the system, but in each case it worked.\\n\\nBut now, for each b, set m=14b-1, then b is fixed, and a is determined mod m, but we need to satisfy the original.\\n\\nBut in each case above, with a chosen as the solution to 14a≡87 mod m, it worked.\\n\\nBut is that always true?\\n\\nRecall how we got 14b≡1 and 14a≡87: from eliminating variables from the original system.\\n\\nSpecifically, we did:\\n\\n4*(eq1) - 3*(eq2): wait no.\\n\\nEarlier:\\n\\nWe had:\\n\\nEq1: 3a+5b≡19 mod m\\n\\nEq2: 4a+2b≡25 mod m\\n\\nWe multiplied eq1 by 4: 12a+20b≡76\\n\\nEq2 by 3: 12a+6b≡75\\n\\nSubtract: (12a+20b) - (12a+6b) = 14b ≡ 76-75=1 mod m → so 14b≡1 mod m\\n\\nSimilarly, to get 14a≡87:\\n\\nWe multiplied eq1 by 2: 6a+10b≡38\\n\\nEq2 by 5: 20a+10b≡125\\n\\nSubtract: (20a+10b)-(6a+10b)=14a≡125-38=87 mod m\\n\\nSo these are necessary conditions derived from the original system. Since we used linear combinations, they are necessary, but are they sufficient?\\n\\nSuppose we have 14b≡1 and 14a≡87 mod m. Can we recover the original?\\n\\nWe need to check if these imply the original equations.\\n\\nBut not necessarily, because we derived them, but the reverse may require that the multipliers are invertible.\\n\\nIn this case, we used multipliers 4 and 3, which may not be invertible mod m.\\n\\nBut in our examples, it worked, so perhaps for those m, it is sufficient.\\n\\nBut the point is, for each b such that m=14b-1 > max(19,25)=25, and m>0, and gcd(14,m)=1, which is true since m=14b-1, and 14b≡1 mod m, so gcd(14,m)|1, so yes.\\n\\nBut then there are infinitely many such m? For each b, m=14b-1, but m must also satisfy that the original congruences hold, which they do in the examples.\\n\\nBut in the derivation, the steps are reversible if the operations are valid.\\n\\nSpecifically, from 14b≡1 and 14a≡87 mod m, we can go back?\\n\\nWe have 14b≡1, 14a≡87.\\n\\nBut the original equations are not directly recoverable.\\n\\nHowever, in our calculation for b=1,2,3, when we plugged in, it worked, so likely for any b, if we set m=14b-1, and a such that 14a≡87 mod m, then the original equations hold.\\n\\nLet me verify generally.\\n\\nSet m = 14b - 1.\\n\\nThen 14b ≡ 1 mod m, good.\\n\\nSet a such that 14a ≡ 87 mod m.\\n\\nNow compute 3a + 5b mod m.\\n\\nWe want this to be 19 mod m.\\n\\nSimilarly for the other.\\n\\nBut we don't know if it's exactly 19, but congruent.\\n\\nFrom the derivation, since we derived 14b≡1 and 14a≡87 from the original system using reversible operations (because we only added/subtracted multiples), and since the multipliers were constants, actually the systems are equivalent as long as we are working over integers, but modulo m, it should be fine.\\n\\nThe transformation is: we have two equations, and we performed row operations: specifically, we replaced the system with linear combinations.\\n\\nThe matrix of coefficients:\\n\\nOriginal: [3,5; 4,2]\\n\\nDeterminant: 3*2 - 5*4 = 6 - 20 = -14\\n\\nThe new system after elimination is essentially based on the differences.\\n\\nBut since we derived necessary conditions, and in the examples sufficient, likely they are equivalent when gcd of the multipliers is 1, but here the determinant is -14, so as long as gcd(14,m)=1, which we have, then the system has a unique solution mod m, so the conditions are equivalent.\\n\\nYes: the coefficient matrix has determinant -14, so if gcd(14,m)=1, then it's invertible mod m, so unique solution.\\n\\nAnd we have found that solution must satisfy 14b≡1 and 14a≡87 mod m, so for each m with gcd(14,m)=1, there is a unique solution (a,b) mod m.\\n\\nBut in our case, we also have that b is integer, and m | (14b -1), so 14b ≡1 mod m, which is satisfied if m|(14b-1).\\n\\nBut for the system to have a solution, we need that the solution (a,b) mod m corresponds to actual integers, which it does as long as we pick representatives.\\n\\nBut the issue is that n is defined as the answer, but there are multiple possible m.\\n\\nUnless... the problem is that n is the answer, but n is used in the modulus as n+1, so it's self-referential.\\n\\nAh! That's the key. The modulus is n+1, and n is the answer to the problem. So n must satisfy that the system has solutions with modulus m=n+1.\\n\\nMoreover, probably n is determined by this condition.\\n\\nBut from above, for many m, it works, so many n=m-1 work.\\n\\nBut perhaps we need the system to have solutions, but also n must be consistent.\\n\\nPerhaps the value of 2a+6b is the same for all such solutions? Let's check.\\n\\nFor b=1, m=13, a≡9 mod 13, so take a=9, b=1\\n\\nThen 2a+6b = 18 + 6 = 24\\n\\nFor b=2, m=27, a≡12 mod 27, a=12, b=2, 2a+6b=24+12=36\\n\\nDifferent! 24 vs 36\\n\\nFor b=3, m=41, a=15, b=3, 2a+6b=30+18=48\\n\\nAll different. So 2a+6b is not constant.\\n\\nBut the problem asks to find 2a+6b, implying it's unique.\\n\\nContradiction.\\n\\nUnless I made a mistake.\\n\\nFor b=1, a=9, m=13\\n\\n3a+5b=27+5=32, 32 mod 13=32-2*13=32-26=6\\n\\n19 mod 13=19-13=6, yes.\\n\\n4a+2b=36+2=38, 38 mod 13=38-2*13=38-26=12\\n\\n25 mod 13=25-13*1=12, yes.\\n\\n2a+6b=18+6=24\\n\\nFor b=2, a=12, m=27\\n\\n3a+5b=36+10=46, 46 mod 27=46-27=19, and 19<27, so yes.\\n\\n4a+2b=48+4=52, 52-27=25, yes.\\n\\n2a+6b=24+12=36\\n\\nBut 24 ≠ 36, so different values.\\n\\nBut the problem asks to find 2a+6b, so it must be unique.\\n\\nUnless the modulus m=n+1 is fixed by the self-reference.\\n\\nAh! Yes, n is the answer, and the modulus is n+1, so for the system to have solutions, m=n+1 must be such that there exist a,b satisfying the congruences, and moreover, n is the value we are to find, but it's circular.\\n\\nBut in each case, for a given solution, n would be m-1, but m depends on the solution.\\n\\nPerhaps we need to find n such that with m=n+1, the system has solutions, and n is that value.\\n\\nBut still, for different m, we have different n.\\n\\nUnless there is a constraint that I missed.\\n\\nAnother thought: perhaps the value 2a+6b is to be found, and it might be the same modulo m, but the problem asks for the value, not modulo.\\n\\nOr perhaps in all cases 2a+6b is congruent to something.\\n\\nFrom earlier, we had 2a+6b ≡ 180 * 14^{-1} mod m\\n\\nAnd since 14b≡1 mod m, so 14^{-1} ≡ b mod m\\n\\nSo 2a+6b ≡ 180 b mod m\\n\\nBut b is variable.\\n\\nFrom 14b≡1, b≡14^{-1}, so 2a+6b ≡ 180 * 14^{-1} mod m\\n\\nBut 14^{-1} is different for each m.\\n\\nFor m=13, 14≡1, so 14^{-1}≡1, so 180*1=180≡180 mod 13: 13*13=169, 180-169=11, and earlier 2a+6b=24, 24 mod 13=11, yes.\\n\\nFor m=27, 14^{-1} mod 27: earlier we had for 7a≡3, but 14x≡1 mod 27\\n\\n14x≡1 mod 27, try x=2, 28≡1, yes, so 14^{-1}≡2 mod 27\\n\\n180*2=360 mod 27\\n\\n27*13=351, 360-351=9\\n\\nEarlier 2a+6b=36, 36 mod 27=9, yes.\\n\\nFor m=41, 14^{-1}≡3 mod 41, as before, 180*3=540 mod 41\\n\\n41*13=533, 540-533=7\\n\\n2a+6b=48, 48-41=7, yes.\\n\\nSo it checks, but the actual value is different.\\n\\nBut the problem is to find 2a+6b, which is not unique.\\n\\nUnless the self-reference fixes n.\\n\\nPerhaps n is not m-1 in the usual sense, but n is defined as the answer, and the modulus is n+1, so for the system to have solutions, m=n+1 must be such that the congruences hold for some a,b, and moreover, since n is the answer, perhaps we need to find n such that this is consistent, but still.\\n\\nAnother idea: perhaps \"let n be the answer\" means that n is the value of 2a+6b, but the problem asks to find 2a+6b, and also says \"instead of determining n, find l = m - 95\", so n is not 2a+6b.\\n\\nLet's read carefully.\\n\\n\"Let n be the answer to this problem.\" So n is whatever the final answer is, but the final answer is what? The problem is to find 2a+6b, but then it says \"instead of determining the value of n, simply find l = m - 95\", so it's confusing.\\n\\nPerhaps \"the answer to this problem\" is n, and the problem is to find 2a+6b, so n = 2a+6b.\\n\\nBut then it says \"find l = m - 95\", where m = n+1, so m = (2a+6b) + 1\\n\\nBut m is the modulus, so we have a system with modulus m = 2a+6b +1\\n\\nAnd a,b satisfy the congruences mod m.\\n\\nThat makes sense for the self-reference.\\n\\nSo let's assume that n = 2a + 6b, the value we are to find.\\n\\nThen m = n + 1 = 2a + 6b + 1\\n\\nAnd the system is:\n\\n\n3a + 5b ≡ 19 mod m\n\\n\n4a + 2b ≡ 25 mod m\n\\n\n\nWith m = 2a + 6b + 1\n\nSince m is the modulus, and 3a+5b and 4a+2b are integers, their values are congruent to 19 and 25 mod m, so:\n\n3a + 5b = 19 + k m for some integer k ≥ 0\n\n4a + 2b = 25 + l m for some integer l ≥ 0\n\nBut since m = 2a + 6b + 1, and a,b positive integers, m is at least 2*1 + 6*1 +1 = 9, and likely larger.\n\nAlso, 3a+5b and 4a+2b are roughly proportional to a and b, while m is also, so perhaps k and l are small.\n\nMoreover, since the right-hand sides are 19 and 25, if m > 19 and m > 25, then k=0 or 1, etc., but m could be large.\n\nBut from the congruences, since they are equal to 19 and 25 mod m, the difference is divisible by m.\n\nBut more importantly, because m = 2a + 6b + 1, and we have expressions, perhaps we can substitute.\n\nLet s = 2a + 6b, so n = s, m = s + 1\n\nNow, we want to express the left-hand sides in terms of s and other things.\n\nNote that s = 2a + 6b\n\nLet me see if I can write 3a+5b and 4a+2b in terms of s.\n\nBut I have two variables.\n\nFrom the system, we can solve for a and b in terms of the values, but it's messy.\n\nSince 3a+5b ≡ 19 mod m and m = s+1 = 2a+6b+1, so 3a+5b - 19 is divisible by 2a+6b+1\n\nSimilarly for the other.\n\nSo let f(a,b) = 3a+5b - 19\n\ng(a,b) = 4a+2b - 25\n\nh(a,b) = 2a+6b +1\n\nAnd h(a,b) divides f(a,b) and g(a,b)\n\nSince h(a,b) | f(a,b) and h(a,b) | g(a,b)\n\nAnd a,b positive integers.\n\nSo 2a+6b+1 divides 3a+5b-19 and 4a+2b-25\n\nLet d = 2a+6b+1\n\nThen d | (3a+5b-19) and d | (4a+2b-25)\n\nNow, I am considering taking linear combinations to eliminate variables.\n\nFor example, make a combination that eliminates a or b.\n\nNote that d = 2a + 6b +1\n\nLet me express a in terms of b and d, but it's integer.\n\nSince d divides those, then d divides any integer linear combination.\n\nLet me compute a combination that gives a multiple of d.\n\nFor example, let me try to eliminate a.\n\nMake the coefficients of a the same.\n\nd has 2a, f has 3a, g has 4a.\n\nLCM of 2,3,4 is 12.\n\nSo 6*d = 6*(2a+6b+1) = 12a + 36b +6\n\n4*f = 4*(3a+5b-19) = 12a +20b -76\n\n3*g = 3*(4a+2b-25) = 12a +6b -75\n\nNow, 6d - 4f = (12a+36b+6) - (12a+20b-76) = 16b +82\n\nSimilarly, 6d - 3g = (12a+36b+6) - (12a+6b-75) = 30b +81\n\nSince d | f and d | g, and d | d, so d divides any combination, so d | (6d - 4f) = 16b +82\n\nSimilarly, d | (6d - 3g) = 30b +81\n\nBut 6d - 4f is divisible by d only if d divides it, but 6d is divisible by d, so d | (6d - 4f) implies d | 4f, but since d | f, yes, d | 4f, so d | (6d - 4f) only if d | 6d, which is true, but 6d - 4f is not necessarily divisible by d unless d | 4f, which is true since d| f.\n\nActually, since d | f, then d | 4f, and d | 6d, so d | (6d - 4f)\n\nSimilarly, d | (6d - 3g)\n\nSo yes, d | (16b + 82) and d | (30b + 81)\n\nSo d divides 16b + 82 and 30b + 81\n\nNow, d = 2a + 6b + 1, but I can work with b.\n\nSo d | (16b + 82) and d | (30b + 81)\n\nTherefore, d divides any linear combination of these two.\n\nFor example, let me eliminate b.\n\nMake coefficients of b the same.\n\nLCM of 16 and 30 is 240.\n\nSo 15*(16b+82) = 240b + 1230\n\n8*(30b+81) = 240b + 648\n\nSubtract: 15(16b+82) - 8(30b+81) = (240b + 1230) - (240b + 648) = 582\n\nSo d divides 582.\n\nBecause d | (16b+82) and d | (30b+81), so d divides any integer combination, in particular, 15 times the first minus 8 times the second: 15(16b+82) - 8(30b+81) = 240b + 1230 - 240b - 648 = 582\n\nYes, so d | 582.\n\nNow d = 2a + 6b + 1 > 0, since a,b ≥1, d ≥ 2+6+1=9\n\nAnd d divides 582.\n\nFactorize 582.\n\n582 divided by 2=291\n\n291 divided by 3=97\n\n97 is prime.\n\nSo 582 = 2 * 3 * 97\n\nSo positive divisors are 1,2,3,6,97,194,291,582\n\nd ≥9, so possible d: 97,194,291,582\n\nNow d = 2a + 6b + 1\n\nAlso, d | (16b + 82) and d | (30b + 81)\n\nWe can check for each d.\n\nStart with d=97\n\nThen 2a + 6b +1 =97, so 2a +6b=96, divide by 2: a +3b=48, so a=48-3b\n\nNow a≥1, so 48-3b≥1, 3b≤47, b≤15.666, so b≤15\n\nAlso b≥1\n\nNow d | (16b +82), so 97 | (16b +82)\n\nSo 16b +82 ≡0 mod 97\n\n16b ≡ -82 mod 97\n\n-82 mod 97 is 97-82=15? No, -82 + 97 =15, yes.\n\nSo 16b ≡ 15 mod 97\n\nSolve for b.\n\nInverse of 16 mod 97.\n\ngcd(16,97)=1, since 97 prime.\n\nFind x such that 16x≡1 mod 97\n\nUse extended euclid.\n\n97 = 6*16 + 1 (since 6*16=96)\n\n16 = 16*1 +0? 97 - 6*16 =97-96=1\n\nSo 1 = 97 - 6*16\n\nThus -6*16 ≡1 mod 97, so inverse is -6 ≡ 91 mod 97\n\nSo b ≡ 15 * 91 mod 97\n\nCompute 15*91=1365\n\n1365 div 97: 97*14=1358, 1365-1358=7, so b≡7 mod 97\n\nSince b≤15, b=7\n\nThen a=48-3*7=48-21=27\n\nNow check the other condition: d | (30b +81)? We have d| both, but let's verify.\n\n30b+81=30*7+81=210+81=291\n\nd=97, 291 / 97=3, since 97*3=291, yes, divisible.\n\nNow check the original congruences with m=d=97\n\nFirst: 3a+5b=3*27+5*7=81+35=116\n\n116 mod 97=116-97=19, yes ≡19 mod 97\n\nSecond: 4a+2b=4*27+2*7=108+14=122\n\n122-97=25, yes ≡25 mod 97\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow n = 2a+6b = 2*27 + 6*7 = 54 + 42 = 96\n\nm = n+1 = 97, which matches d=97.\n\nNow check other possible d to see if there are others.\n\nNext d=194\n\nThen 2a+6b+1=194, so 2a+6b=193\n\nBut left side even, right side odd, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, d=291\n\n2a+6b+1=291, 2a+6b=290, so a+3b=145\n\na=145-3b≥1, so b≤48\n\nNow d| (16b+82), so 291 | (16b+82)\n\n16b+82 ≡0 mod 291\n\n16b ≡ -82 mod 291\n\n-82 + 291=209, so 16b≡209 mod 291\n\nNow gcd(16,291). 291÷3=97, 16 and 291, 291 odd, not div by 2, sum digits 2+9+1=12 div by 3, 16 not div by 3, gcd? 291÷16=18*16=288, remainder 3, then 16÷3=5*3=15, rem 1, 3÷1=3, rem 0, so gcd=1.\n\nSo solve 16b≡209 mod 291\n\nInverse of 16 mod 291.\n\nFrom euclid: 291 = 18*16 + 3 (18*16=288)\n\n16 = 5*3 +1\n\n3=3*1+0\n\nSo 1=16-5*3\n\n3=291-18*16\n\nSo 1=16-5*(291-18*16)=16-5*291+90*16=91*16 -5*291\n\nSo inverse is 91\n\nb≡209*91 mod 291\n\nCompute 209*91=209*(90+1)=209*90 +209=18810+209=19019\n\nNow 19019 mod 291\n\nFirst, 291*65=291*60 +291*5=17460+1455=18915\n\n19019-18915=104\n\nSo b≡104 mod 291\n\nb≤48, 104>48, and next is negative, so no solution.\n\nSimilarly, d=582\n\n2a+6b+1=582, 2a+6b=581, odd, left even, impossible.\n\nSo only possible d=97\n\nThus m=97, n=96\n\nNow we need to find ℓ = m - 95 = 97 - 95 = 2\n\nBut the problem says \"find ℓ = m - 95\", and m=n+1=97\n\nSo ℓ=2\n\nNow Problem 2.\n\nQuadrilateral ABCD with AB=2, BC=3, CD=5, DA=4. Find maximum possible radius of a circle inscribed in it.\n\nA circle can be inscribed in a quadrilateral if and only if the sum of opposite sides are equal.\n\nThat is, AB + CD = AD + BC\n\nHere AB=2, CD=5, sum=7\n\nAD=4, BC=3, sum=7, yes, equal.\n\nSo it is tangential, and a circle can be inscribed.\n\nThe area of a tangential quadrilateral is equal to r * s, where r is the inradius, and s is the semiperimeter.\n\nSemiperimeter s = (AB+BC+CD+DA)/2 = (2+3+5+4)/2 = 14/2 = 7\n\nArea A = r * s = r * 7\n\nSo r = A / 7\n\nTo maximize r, we need to maximize the area A of the quadrilateral.\n\nSo we need the maximum possible area of a quadrilateral with given side lengths AB=2, BC=3, CD=5, DA=4.\n\nFor a given set of side lengths, the area is maximized when the quadrilateral is cyclic, by Brahmagupta's formula.\n\nIs that correct? For a quadrilateral with fixed side lengths, the area is maximized when it is cyclic.\n\nYes, that's a standard result.\n\nSo maximum area when ABCD is cyclic.\n\nThen we can use Brahmagupta's formula.\n\nBrahmagupta: for cyclic quadrilateral with sides a,b,c,d, area = √[(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)]\n\nHere, set a=AB=2, b=BC=3, c=CD=5, d=DA=4\n\ns=7\n\nSo area = √[(7-2)(7-3)(7-5)(7-4)] = √[5 * 4 * 2 * 3] = √[120] = 2√30\n\nCompute: 5*4=20, 2*3=6, 20*6=120, √120=√(4*30)=2√30\n\nSo A_max = 2√30\n\nThen r = A / s = 2√30 / 7\n\nBut is this the maximum possible? The quadrilateral must be convex, I assume, and cyclic gives maximum area.\n\nBut is there a constraint that it must be able to have an incircle? But we already have AB+CD=AD+BC=7, so for any such quadrilateral with these side lengths, as long as it's tangential, which it is iff the sums are equal, which they are, so every such quadrilateral with these side lengths has an incircle, regardless of angles.\n\nIs that true?\n\nActually, for a quadrilateral to have an incircle, the necessary and sufficient condition is that the sums of opposite sides are equal. This is independent of the angles, as long as it's convex and simple.\n\nSo yes, any quadrilateral with these side lengths will have an incircle, since AB+CD=2+5=7, AD+BC=4+3=7.\n\nSo the inradius r = A / s, with s=7.\n\nTo maximize r, maximize A.\n\nAnd A is maximized when the quadrilateral is cyclic, giving A=√[(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)] = √[5*4*2*3]=√120=2√30\n\nSo r_max = 2√30 / 7\n\nBut is this achievable? When it's cyclic and tangential, which is possible.\n\nA quadrilateral that is both cyclic and tangential is called a bicentric quadrilateral.\n\nAnd for given side lengths, as long as the sums of opposite sides are equal, and it can be formed, it should be possible to make it cyclic, and since the side sum condition is satisfied, it will have an incircle.\n\nIn this case, with sides 2,3,5,4, and s=7, and (s-a)=5, etc., all positive, so it can form a quadrilateral.\n\nThe maximum area is indeed when cyclic.\n\nSo r = A/s = 2√30 / 7\n\nBut let me confirm the formula.\n\nArea = r * s, yes.\n\ns is semiperimeter, yes.\n\nSo r = area / s\n\nMax area is 2√30, s=7, so r=2√30 / 7\n\nBut is this simplified? Yes.\n\nWe can write as (2/7)√30\n\nBut probably fine.\n\nNow, back to problem 1, we have ℓ = m - 95 = 97 - 95 = 2\n\nAnd for problem 2, r = 2√30 / 7\n\nBut in problem 1, we found ℓ=2\n\nNow to box the answers.\n\nBut in problem 1, it says \"find ℓ = m - 95\", and we got 2.\n\nAnd for problem 2, the radius.\n\nNow, is there any other consideration? In problem 1, we assumed n=2a+6b, which makes sense because of the self-reference.\n\nWithout that, it was ambiguous, but with that, it works.\n\nAnd we got a unique solution.\n\nSo answer for problem 1 is ℓ=2\n\nFor problem 2, r=2√30 / 7\n\nNow to write in JSON.\n\nNote: in problem 1, it says \"find ℓ = m - 95\", so answer is ℓ, which is 2.\n\nIn problem 2, the radius.\n\nSo final answers.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"2\\\\sqrt{30}/7\"\n}",
