      "A1054": "Among citizens of Cambridge there exist 8 different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are 256 students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them. Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random, and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all 256 students, in hours? Instead of computing the expected total suffering across all students, simply find $e = N - 86$, where $N$ is the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\n\\nWe are told there are 8 different blood antigens, and each student has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of these antigens. There are 256 students, and since 2^8 = 256, this implies that every possible subset of the 8 antigens corresponds to exactly one student's blood type. So, the students represent all possible subsets of the 8 antigens.\\n\\nNow, N is defined as the number of students whose blood type includes a given antigen. Let’s fix one antigen, say antigen A. How many subsets of the 8 antigens include A? For each antigen, half of the total subsets will include it, because for each of the other 7 antigens, they can be either included or not (2^7 = 128). So, exactly 128 students have antigen A in their blood type. Therefore, N = 128.\\n\\nThen, e = N - 86 = 128 - 86 = 42.\\n\\nSo the answer to Problem 1 is 42.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nLet the three integers James wrote be a, b, c.\\n\\nAlex picks two of them, takes their average, and adds the third. So the three possible operations are:\\n\\n1. (a + b)/2 + c\\n2. (a + c)/2 + b\\n3. (b + c)/2 + a\\n\\nWe are told these expressions evaluate to 42, 13, and 37 in some order.\\n\\nLet’s denote:\\n\\nx = (a + b)/2 + c = (a + b + 2c)/2\\ny = (a + c)/2 + b = (a + 2b + c)/2\\nz = (b + c)/2 + a = (2a + b + c)/2\\n\\nSo the three values are:\\n\\nS1 = (a + b + 2c)/2\\nS2 = (a + 2b + c)/2\\nS3 = (2a + b + c)/2\\n\\nAnd {S1, S2, S3} = {42, 13, 37}\\n\\nLet’s add all three:\\n\\nS1 + S2 + S3 = [ (a + b + 2c) + (a + 2b + c) + (2a + b + c) ] / 2\\n= (4a + 4b + 4c) / 2 = 2(a + b + c)\\n\\nSum of the three results: 42 + 13 + 37 = 92\\n\\nSo: 2(a + b + c) = 92 → a + b + c = 46\\n\\nNow we use this to find individual values.\\n\\nRecall:\\nS1 = (a + b + 2c)/2 = ( (a + b + c) + c ) / 2 = (46 + c)/2\\nSimilarly:\\nS2 = (46 + b)/2\\nS3 = (46 + a)/2\\n\\nSo each of the three results is (46 + variable)/2\\n\\nTherefore:\\n(46 + a)/2 ∈ {42,13,37}\\n(46 + b)/2 ∈ {42,13,37}\\n(46 + c)/2 ∈ {42,13,37}\\n\\nTry solving for a:\\nIf (46 + a)/2 = 42 → 46 + a = 84 → a = 38\\nIf = 37 → 46 + a = 74 → a = 28\\nIf = 13 → 46 + a = 26 → a = -20\\n\\nSimilarly for b and c: possible values are 38, 28, -20\\n\\nNow, a + b + c = 46\\nTry combinations of three numbers from {38, 28, -20} that sum to 46.\\nTry 38, 28, -20: 38+28=66, 66-20=46 → yes!\\nSo the three numbers are 38, 28, -20\\n\\nNow verify which result corresponds to which.\\nLet a = 38, b = 28, c = -20\\n\\nCompute:\\n(a + b)/2 + c = (66)/2 + (-20) = 33 - 20 = 13\\n(a + c)/2 + b = (38 - 20)/2 + 28 = 18/2 + 28 = 9 + 28 = 37\\n(b + c)/2 + a = (28 - 20)/2 + 38 = 8/2 + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42\\n\\nSo results are 13, 37, 42 — matches the given set.\\n\\nThus, the three integers are 38, 28, and -20.\\n\\nOrder doesn't matter; any permutation is acceptable, but typically we list in ascending or descending order. Let's write them in sorted order: -20, 28, 38\\nBut since the problem asks for “the three integers”, and doesn’t specify order, any representation is fine. We'll present them as a list.\\n\\nFinal answers:\\nAnswer 1: 42\\nAnswer 2: -20, 28, 38\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"42\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"-20, 28, 38\"\n}",
