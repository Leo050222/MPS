      "A401": "Trevor and Edward play a game in which they take turns adding or removing beans from a pile. On each turn, a player must either add or remove the largest perfect square number of beans that is in the heap. The player who empties the pile wins. For example, if Trevor goes first with a pile of 5 beans, he can either add 4 to make the total 9, or remove 4 to make the total 1, and either way Edward wins by removing all the beans. There is no limit to how large the pile can grow; it just starts with some finite number of beans in it, say fewer than 1000. Before the game begins, Edward dispatches a spy to find out how many beans will be in the opening pile, call this $n$, then \"graciously\" offers to let Trevor go first. Knowing that the first player is more likely to win, but not knowing $n$, Trevor logically but unwisely accepts, and Edward goes on to win the game. Find a number $n$ less than 1000 that would prompt this scenario, assuming both players are perfect logicians. A correct answer is worth the nearest integer to $\\log _{2}(n-4)$ points. Instead of finding an initial pile size $n$ less than 1000 that is a losing position for the first player under perfect play, simply find $k = s(p) - 6$, where $p$ is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example, and $s(p)$ is the largest perfect square at most $p$."

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We are told that in the example, Trevor starts with a pile of 5 beans. The largest perfect square ≤ 5 is 4. So Trevor can either add 4 (making 9) or remove 4 (making 1). Edward then wins in both cases.\\n\\nWe are asked to compute k = s(p) - 6, where p is the pile size reached by adding the largest perfect square number of beans to the initial pile in the example.\\n\\nIn the example, initial pile n = 5. Largest perfect square ≤ 5 is 4. Adding it gives p = 5 + 4 = 9.\\n\\nNow, s(p) is defined as the largest perfect square at most p. Since p = 9, and 9 is a perfect square, s(9) = 9.\\n\\nThen k = s(p) - 6 = 9 - 6 = 3.\\n\\nSo answer_1 = \\\"3\\\".\\n\\nProblem 2: We are to count the number of distinct colorings of the vertices of a tetrahedron using three colors (red, blue, green), such that no face has all three vertices the same color, up to rotational symmetry.\\n\\nA tetrahedron has 4 vertices and 4 triangular faces. Each face has 3 vertices. The condition is that no face is monochromatic (all three vertices same color).\\n\\nWe are coloring each vertex one of 3 colors, so total colorings without considering symmetry: 3^4 = 81.\\n\\nBut we must consider rotational symmetries of the tetrahedron. The rotation group of the tetrahedron is A4, which has 12 elements (12 rotational symmetries).\\n\\nWe will use Burnside's Lemma to count the number of distinct colorings up to rotation, but with the restriction that no face is monochromatic.\\n\\nHowever, instead of counting all colorings and subtracting bad ones, we need to count only those colorings where no face has all three vertices the same color, and then account for symmetry.\\n\\nBut because the condition is on faces (not just vertex colors), and the symmetry acts on vertices, we need to be careful.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the number is small, we can classify colorings by partitions of 4 vertices into color classes, apply Burnside, but restrict to those satisfying the face condition.\\n\\nLet’s proceed step by step.\\n\\nFirst, list all possible colorings (up to symmetry) that satisfy the condition.\\n\\nNote: A face has three vertices. If any three vertices are the same color, and they form a face, it's invalid. But in a tetrahedron, every set of three vertices forms a face. There are exactly four faces, each omitting one vertex.\\n\\nSo the condition is: no three vertices that form a face are all the same color. Since every triple of vertices is a face, this means: no three vertices have the same color.\\n\\nTherefore, the condition simplifies to: no color appears on three or more vertices.\\n\\nBecause if a color appears on 3 or 4 vertices, then those 3 vertices form a face (since any three do), and that face would be monochromatic.\\n\\nSo the condition is equivalent to: no color used on 3 or 4 vertices.\\n\\nThus, each color appears at most twice.\\n\\nSince there are 4 vertices and each color at most twice, the only possible color distributions are:\\n\\n- Two colors used twice each: (2,2,0)\\n- One color used twice, two colors used once: (2,1,1)\\n- All colors different? But only 3 colors and 4 vertices → impossible to have all different. Wait: 4 vertices, 3 colors, each color at most twice.\\n\\nPossible partitions of 4 under these constraints:\\n\\n- (2,2,0): two colors appear twice, one color not used\\n- (2,1,1): one color appears twice, two colors appear once\\n- (1,1,1,1)? No, only 3 colors. So maximum 3 color classes. So (1,1,2) is same as (2,1,1)\\n\\n(1,1,1,1) would require 4 colors, not allowed. So only possibilities are (2,2,0) and (2,1,1)\\n\\nBut (2,1,1) sums to 4, yes. And (2,2,0) also.\\n\\nNow, we must count the number of colorings with these distributions, up to rotational symmetry, such that no color is on 3 or more vertices — which is already enforced by these types.\\n\\nNow apply Burnside's Lemma.\\n\\nBurnside: Number of distinct colorings = (1/|G|) * Σ_{g ∈ G} Fix(g), where G is the rotation group of the tetrahedron, |G| = 12.\\n\\nBut now we restrict to colorings satisfying the condition (no monochromatic face), i.e., colorings of type (2,2,0) or (2,1,1).\\n\\nWe need to compute the number of such colorings fixed by each group element, but only among valid colorings.\\n\\nAlternatively, compute total number of valid colorings (without symmetry), then divide by symmetry, but Burnside is better.\\n\\nList conjugacy classes of A4:\\n\\n- Identity: 1 element\\n- Double transpositions (products of two disjoint transpositions): e.g., (AB)(CD) — these correspond to 180° rotations about an axis through midpoints of opposite edges. There are 3 such.\\n- 3-cycles: two types — clockwise and counterclockwise, but in A4, 3-cycles split into two conjugacy classes? No, in A4, 3-cycles form two conjugacy classes of size 4 each? Wait.\\n\\nActually, A4 has:\\n- 1 identity\\n- 8 elements of order 3: the 3-cycles (like (ABC), (ACB), etc.) — there are 8 of them (since (4 choose 3)*2 = 8)\\n- 3 elements of order 2: the double transpositions: (AB)(CD), (AC)(BD), (AD)(BC)\\n\\nTotal: 1 + 8 + 3 = 12, good.\\n\\nNow, for each type, compute number of valid colorings fixed by that symmetry.\\n\\nA coloring is fixed by a group element g if the coloring is constant on the cycles of g.\\n\\nWe'll go by conjugacy class.\\n\\nClass 1: Identity (1 element)\\n\\nFix(identity) = number of valid colorings.\\n\\nValid colorings: no color used 3 or 4 times.\\n\\nTotal colorings: 3^4 = 81\\n\\nSubtract monochromatic: 3 (all red, all blue, all green)\\n\\nSubtract colorings with exactly 3 vertices same color.\\n\\nNumber with exactly 3 same color: choose the color used 3 times: 3 choices. Choose which 3 vertices: C(4,3)=4. The remaining vertex: 2 color choices (not the same as the majority, otherwise it would be 4 same). So 3 * 4 * 2 = 24.\\n\\nBut wait: if 3 are same, and fourth different, that's exactly 3 of one color.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo number of invalid colorings: monochromatic (4 same): 3, plus 3-of-a-kind: 24, total 27.\\n\\nSo valid colorings: 81 - 27 = 54.\\n\\nBut is that correct? Monochromatic is included in 3-or-more, but we subtracted separately: 3 (for 4 same) and 24 (for exactly 3 same), total 27, so 81-27=54 valid.\\n\\nAlternatively, count directly:\\n\\nType (2,2,0): choose which color is missing: 3 choices. Then partition 4 vertices into two pairs. Number of ways to partition 4 labeled vertices into two unordered pairs: 3 ways (since fix one vertex, pair it with one of 3 others, but then the remaining two are paired, and since pairs are indistinct in order, divide by 2? Wait: standard count: number of perfect matchings in K4 is 3: AB-CD, AC-BD, AD-BC.\\n\\nBut here, we assign colors to the pairs. We have two colors, say R and B, and we assign each pair a color.\\n\\nAfter choosing which color is missing (3 choices), we assign the two colors to the two pairs: 2 ways (which pair gets first color).\\n\\nBut the two colors are distinct, so once we choose which two colors to use (C(3,2)=3), then assign them to two pairs.\\n\\nBetter: choose two colors to use: C(3,2)=3. Then assign the 4 vertices into two pairs, and assign the two colors to the two pairs.\\n\\nNumber of ways to partition 4 labeled vertices into two unlabeled pairs: 3, as above.\\n\\nThen assign the two colors to the two pairs: 2 ways.\\n\\nSo total for (2,2,0): 3 (choose two colors) * 3 (pairings) * 2 (assign colors to pairs) = 3*3*2=18.\\n\\nBut since the pairs are unlabeled in the partition, but when we assign colors, it matters.\\n\\nExample: colors R,B. Pairing AB-CD. Assign R to AB, B to CD; or R to CD, B to AB. These are different.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nNumber of ways: choose color for first pair, etc., but our count seems right: 3 choices for which color omitted, then number of ways to color vertices with the other two colors, each used twice, and no further restrictions.\\n\\nNumber of such colorings: multinomial 4!/(2!2!) = 6 per pair of colors. Since two colors chosen: C(3,2)=3, so 3 * 6 = 18. Yes.\\n\\nType (2,1,1): one color used twice, two colors used once.\\n\\nChoose the color used twice: 3 choices.\\n\\nChoose which two vertices get that color: C(4,2)=6.\\n\\nThe remaining two vertices get the two other colors, one each: 2 ways to assign the two colors to the two vertices.\\n\\nSo total: 3 * 6 * 2 = 36.\\n\\nTotal valid colorings: 18 + 36 = 54, matches earlier.\\n\\nSo Fix(identity) = 54.\\n\\nClass 2: Double transpositions, e.g., (AB)(CD). There are 3 such elements.\\n\\nTake g = (AB)(CD). Cycle structure: two 2-cycles.\\n\\nFor a coloring to be fixed by g, we must have color(A)=color(B), and color(C)=color(D).\\n\\nSo the coloring is determined by color of A and color of C.\\n\\nNow, we need the coloring to be valid: no color used 3 or 4 times.\\n\\nPossible color assignments:\\n\\nLet cA = color of A and B, cC = color of C and D.\\n\\nEach of cA and cC is one of 3 colors.\\n\\nCase 1: cA = cC. Then all four vertices same color → monochromatic → invalid.\\n\\nCase 2: cA ≠ cC. Then two vertices color cA, two vertices color cC. So distribution (2,2,0), which is valid.\\n\\nNumber of such colorings: choose cA: 3 choices, cC: 2 choices (different from cA), so 3*2=6.\\n\\nSince the symmetry fixes the coloring only if colors are constant on cycles, and here we have two pairs, each uniform.\\n\\nAnd only when the two pairs have different colors, it's valid.\\n\\nSo Fix(g) = 6 for each such g.\\n\\nThere are 3 such g, so total contribution: 3 * 6 = 18.\\n\\nClass 3: 3-cycles, e.g., (ABC), meaning A→B→C→A, D fixed.\\n\\nCycle structure: one 3-cycle and one 1-cycle.\\n\\nFor coloring to be fixed by g, we need color(A)=color(B)=color(C), and color(D) arbitrary.\\n\\nSo A,B,C same color, say X. D color Y.\\n\\nNow, is this coloring valid?\\n\\nVertices A,B,C are all color X. But A,B,C form a face, so this face is monochromatic → invalid.\\n\\nUnless... but yes, any three vertices form a face, so face ABC is monochromatic.\\n\\nTherefore, every such coloring is invalid.\\n\\nSo Fix(g) = 0 for each 3-cycle.\\n\\nThere are 8 such elements.\\n\\nSo total sum over g of Fix(g) = Fix(id) + sum over double transpositions + sum over 3-cycles = 54 + 18 + 0 = 72.\\n\\nThen number of distinct colorings up to rotation = (1/12) * 72 = 6.\\n\\nSo answer_2 = \\\"6\\\".\\n\\nBut let me verify with an example.\\n\\nFor (2,2,0) type: two colors, each twice.\\n\\nUnder rotation, how many orbits?\\n\\nThe pairing: the way the two pairs are connected.\\n\\nIn a tetrahedron, any two disjoint edges are equivalent under rotation? Actually, in tetrahedron, all pairs of disjoint edges are equivalent, because the graph is symmetric.\\n\\nFor example, edges AB and CD: if they don't share a vertex, they are opposite.\\n\\nIn tetrahedron, there are three pairs of opposite edges.\\n\\nBut under rotation, they are all equivalent.\\n\\nSo for a fixed pair of colors, say R and B, the coloring where one pair of opposite edges are R, the other B — but wait, we are coloring vertices, not edges.\\n\\nIn (2,2,0), we have two vertices color R, two color B.\\n\\nThe two R vertices may be adjacent or opposite?\\n\\nIn tetrahedron, every pair of vertices is connected by an edge, so no non-adjacent vertices — it's complete graph K4.\\n\\nSo any two vertices are adjacent.\\n\\nThe distance between any two vertices is 1.\\n\\nBut in terms of the configuration: when we have two vertices of one color, the edge between them is an edge.\\n\\nThe other two similarly.\\n\\nThe two edges (one for each color pair) may share a vertex or not.\\n\\nBut since there are four vertices, if I pick two for R, they form an edge. The remaining two for B form another edge. These two edges are disjoint if no common vertex, which they don't, so they are a pair of disjoint edges.\\n\\nIn K4, a partition of vertices into two pairs corresponds to a perfect matching, i.e., a pair of disjoint edges.\\n\\nAnd in the tetrahedron, all perfect matchings are equivalent under rotation. There are three such matchings, and the rotation group acts transitively on them (since |G|=12, stabilizer of a matching: rotations that preserve the pair of opposite edges. For example, 180° rotation swaps the two edges, and also swaps within? Actually, the stabilizer of a matching might be order 2: the 180° rotation about the axis through midpoints of the two edges.\\n\\nNumber of matchings: 3, |G|=12, so orbit size would be |G|/|stab|. If transitive, orbit size 3, so |stab|=4? But earlier we thought stab has order 2.\\n\\nActually, for a fixed perfect matching, say edges AB and CD. Rotations that preserve this set: \\n- 180° rotation swapping A and B, C and D? But that would require fixing the edge, but in rotation, can we swap endpoints?\\n\\nActually, a 180° rotation about the axis through the midpoints of AB and CD will swap A and B, and swap C and D. So it preserves the coloring if both pairs are uniformly colored, but it swaps the vertices.\\n\\nBut for the partition, it preserves the pair {A,B} and {C,D} as sets.\\n\\nAlso, the identity.\\n\\nIs there more? A 120° rotation? Probably not.\\n\\nSo stabilizer has order 2: identity and 180° rotation.\\n\\nThen orbit size = |G|/|stab| = 12/2 = 6, but there are only 3 matchings, contradiction.\\n\\nI think I confused.\\n\\nThe group acts on the set of perfect matchings.\\n\\nThere are 3 perfect matchings: M1 = {AB,CD}, M2={AC,BD}, M3={AD,BC}.\\n\\nThe rotation group A4 acts on these 3 matchings.\\n\\nWhat is the action? A rotation permutes the vertices, hence permutes the matchings.\\n\\nFor example, a 3-cycle (ABC) sends edge AB to BC, BC to CA, CA to AB, etc.\\n\\nSpecifically, (ABC): A→B, B→C, C→A, D→D.\\n\\nSo edge AB → B C, edge CD → C D? C→A, D→D, so CD → A D.\\n\\nSo matching M1 = {AB,CD} → {BC, AD}\\n\\nBut {BC, AD} is M3, since AD and BC.\\n\\nSimilarly, M2={AC,BD}: AC → B A = AB, BD → C D = CD, so {AB,CD}=M1.\\n\\nM3={AD,BC}: AD → B D = BD, BC → C A = CA, so {BD,CA}=M2.\\n\\nSo (ABC) sends M1→M3, M3→M2, M2→M1, so a 3-cycle on matchings.\\n\\nSimilarly, other 3-cycles act as 3-cycles.\\n\\nThe double transposition (AB)(CD): swaps A and B, C and D.\\n\\nThen edge AB → BA=AB, CD→DC=CD, so fixes M1.\\n\\nEdge AC → B D = BD, BD → A C = AC, so swaps AC and BD, so swaps M2 with itself? M2={AC,BD}, so it swaps the edges, but the set is preserved.\\n\\nSimilarly, AD → B C = BC, BC → A D = AD, so swaps AD and BC, so M3 preserved.\\n\\nSo (AB)(CD) fixes all three matchings? But as sets.\\n\\nWhen we apply (AB)(CD) to the matching M1={AB,CD}, since it swaps A and B, but AB is still AB (undirected), similarly CD, so M1 is fixed.\\n\\nSimilarly, M2={AC,BD}: AC becomes B D = BD, BD becomes A C = AC, so the set {AC,BD} becomes {BD,AC}, same set. So M2 fixed.\\n\\nSimilarly M3 fixed.\\n\\nSo this element fixes all matchings.\\n\\nBut earlier we thought it only fixes M1, but no, it preserves each matching as a set.\\n\\nNow, the action: since (ABC) cycles the three matchings, the action is transitive, and stabilizer of M1: elements that fix M1 setwise.\\n\\nFrom above, (AB)(CD) fixes M1.\\n\\nAlso, the identity.\\n\\nIs there more? Consider a rotation that swaps A and B, and swaps C and D — that's (AB)(CD), already have.\\n\\nOr a rotation that fixes the axis, but perhaps only these two.\\n\\nSuppose a rotation that rotates around, but likely only order 2.\\n\\nSo stabilizer of M1 has order 2: identity and (AB)(CD).\\n\\nThen orbit size = 12 / 2 = 6, but there are only 3 matchings, so orbit can't be size 6.\\n\\nContradiction.\\n\\nI see: the group element (AB)(CD) is in the stabilizer, but does it fix the matching? Yes, as a set.\\n\\nBut the orbit-stabilizer theorem says |orbit| * |stab| = |G|.\\n\\nIf stab has order 2, |G|=12, then |orbit|=6, but there are only 3 matchings, so impossible.\\n\\nTherefore, my assumption is wrong.\\n\\nPerhaps (AB)(CD) does not fix M1? But it does, as the set {AB,CD} is invariant.\\n\\nUnless the action is on the matchings as labeled, but no, matchings are sets of edges.\\n\\nPerhaps I miscalculated the effect.\\n\\n(AB)(CD) applied to edge AB: since it swaps A and B, the edge AB is mapped to itself (as undirected edge).\\nSimilarly CD to itself.\\nSo yes, M1 is fixed.\\n\\nBut then why orbit size issue?\\n\\nUnless the stabilizer is larger.\\n\\nConsider the 180 degree rotation about the axis through midpoints of AB and CD. This rotation swaps A and B, swaps C and D, and swaps the two edges.\\n\\nBut in terms of permutation of vertices, it is (A B)(C D), which is even permutation, so in A4.\\n\\nNow, is there another rotation that preserves M1?\\n\\nFor example, a 120 degree rotation? Probably not, because it would move the edges.\\n\\nPerhaps only this one non-identity element.\\n\\nBut then stab has order 2, |G|=12, so orbit should have 6 elements, but only 3 matchings, contradiction.\\n\\nUnless the action is not faithful or something.\\n\\nI recall that the rotation group of the tetrahedron acts on the 3 pairs of opposite edges.\\n\\nAnd it is known that this action gives a homomorphism to S3, and since A4 has no subgroup of index 2, but actually, the kernel is the Klein four-group? No.\\n\\nStandard fact: the rotation group of the tetrahedron is A4, and it acts on the 3 pairs of opposite edges, and this action is transitive, and the kernel is the normal subgroup of order 4? But A4 has a normal subgroup V4 of order 4, consisting of the identity and the three double transpositions.\\n\\nAh! I forgot: there are three double transpositions: (AB)(CD), (AC)(BD), (AD)(BC).\\n\\nEach corresponds to a 180 degree rotation about an axis through midpoints of a pair of opposite edges.\\n\\nNow, the action on the set of such axes: there are three such axes (one for each pair of opposite edges).\\n\\nThe group A4 acts on these three axes.\\n\\nAn element like (AB)(CD) fixes the axis corresponding to edges AB and CD, but swaps the other axes? Let's see.\\n\\nBut for the matching: each double transposition corresponds to a matching.\\n\\nDefine: matching M1 corresponds to edges AB and CD, and the rotation (AB)(CD) is associated with it.\\n\\nNow, when we apply a group element, it permutes the matchings.\\n\\nTake g = (ABC), as before.\\n\\ng sends vertex A to B, B to C, C to A, D to D.\\n\\nSo edge AB goes to g(A)g(B)=B C\\nEdge CD goes to g(C)g(D)=A D\\nSo the matching {AB,CD} goes to {BC, AD}\\n\\nNow, {BC, AD} is the matching for edges BC and AD, which is M3 if we define M3={AD,BC}.\\n\\nSimilarly, as before.\\n\\nNow, what about the stabilizer of M1={AB,CD}.\\n\\nWhich rotations preserve this set of two edges?\\n\\n- The 180 degree rotation about the axis through midpoints of AB and CD: this is (A B)(C D), which swaps A and B, C and D, so it maps AB to itself, CD to itself, so fixes the matching setwise.\\n\\n- Also, the identity.\\n\\nAre there more? Suppose a rotation that cycles the vertices in a way that preserves the edges.\\n\\nFor example, a 120 degree rotation around a vertex? But that would move the edges.\\n\\nSuppose we rotate around vertex D: but (A B C) moves A,B,C, so AB goes to BC, not preserved.\\n\\nSo only two elements: identity and (AB)(CD).\\n\\nBut |stab|=2, |G|=12, so |orbit|=6, but there are only 3 matchings, so the orbit can have at most 3 elements.\\n\\nThis is impossible unless the action is not transitive, but earlier (ABC) sends M1 to M3, M3 to M2, M2 to M1, so it is transitive, orbit size 3.\\n\\nContradiction.\\n\\nUnless (AB)(CD) is not in the stabilizer? But it is.\\n\\nI see the mistake: when we apply the permutation (AB)(CD) to the matching M1={AB,CD}, it maps to {(A B)(C D)(AB), (A B)(C D)(CD)} = {BA, DC} = {AB, CD}, same set. So yes.\\n\\nBut perhaps for the coloring, but for now, for the matching.\\n\\nThe only explanation is that the stabilizer is larger.\\n\\nLet me list all elements that fix M1 setwise.\\n\\nM1 = {AB, CD}\\n\\nApply a permutation σ, σ(M1) = {σ(A)σ(B), σ(C)σ(D)}\\n\\nSet equal to {AB, CD} as a set.\\n\\nSo either:\\n- σ(A)σ(B) = AB and σ(C)σ(D) = CD, or\\n- σ(A)σ(B) = CD and σ(C)σ(D) = AB\\n\\nFirst case: σ fixes the pair {A,B} and {C,D} setwise.\\n\\nSo σ permutes A and B, and permutes C and D.\\n\\nPossibilities: \\n- σ = identity\\n- σ = (A B)\\n- σ = (C D)\\n- σ = (A B)(C D)\\n\\nBut (A B) is odd permutation, not in A4 (rotation group).\\nSimilarly (C D) odd.\\nOnly even permutations: identity and (A B)(C D)\\n\\nSecond case: σ(A)σ(B) = CD and σ(C)σ(D) = AB\\n\\nSo σ maps {A,B} to {C,D} and {C,D} to {A,B}\\n\\nFor example, σ(A)=C, σ(B)=D, σ(C)=A, σ(D)=B, so σ = (A C)(B D)\\n\\nOr σ(A)=D, σ(B)=C, σ(C)=B, σ(D)=A, so σ = (A D)(B C)\\n\\nNow, (A C)(B D) is a double transposition, even, in A4.\\nSimilarly (A D)(B C) in A4.\\n\\nNow, check if they are in the group.\\n\\n(A C)(B D): swaps A and C, B and D.\\n\\nIs this a rotation? In tetrahedron, swapping two pairs of opposite vertices? But vertices are all equivalent.\\n\\nThis permutation: A↔C, B↔D.\\n\\nThis is the 180 degree rotation about the axis through midpoints of edges AC and BD? Edges AC and BD are opposite if they don't share vertex, which they don't.\\n\\nYes, and such a rotation swaps A and C, B and D, so it is (A C)(B D).\\n\\nSimilarly, (A D)(B C) is the rotation for the other pair.\\n\\nBut now, apply to M1={AB,CD}:\\n\\nσ = (A C)(B D): σ(A)=C, σ(B)=D, so σ(AB)=C D\\nσ(C)=A, σ(D)=B, so σ(CD)=A B\\nSo σ({AB,CD}) = {CD, AB} = same set.\\n\\nSimilarly for (A D)(B C): σ(A)=D, σ(B)=C, σ(AB)=D C = CD\\nσ(C)=B, σ(D)=A, σ(CD)=B A = AB, so again {CD, AB}\\n\\nSo all three double transpositions fix M1 setwise?\\n\\nBut (A C)(B D) is associated with matching M2={AC,BD}, but it still fixes M1 as a set.\\n\\nSimilarly, (A D)(B C) fixes M1.\\n\\nAnd (A B)(C D) fixes M1.\\n\\nAnd identity.\\n\\nSo stabilizer of M1 has at least 4 elements: the three double transpositions and identity.\\n\\nBut the three double transpositions are (AB)(CD), (AC)(BD), (AD)(BC).\\n\\nAll of them, when applied to M1={AB,CD}, give back {AB,CD}, as we saw for (AC)(BD): it sends AB to CD, CD to AB, so the set is preserved.\\n\\nYes!\\n\\nSo for any double transposition, it swaps the two edges in a matching or something, but in this case, for M1, (AC)(BD) sends AB to CD and CD to AB, so it swaps the two edges, but the set is the same.\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nSo all three double transpositions fix M1 setwise.\\n\\nPlus identity, so stabilizer has at least 4 elements.\\n\\nNow, are there more? The 3-cycles? (ABC): sends AB to BC, CD to AD, so {AB,CD} to {BC,AD}, which is different, not M1.\\n\\nSo only the Klein four-group: {id, (AB)(CD), (AC)(BD), (AD)(BC)}\\n\\nOrder 4.\\n\\nThen |stab| = 4, |G| = 12, so |orbit| = 12/4 = 3, which matches the number of matchings, and since transitive, good.\\n\\nBack to Burnside.\\n\\nFor a double transposition g, say g = (AB)(CD)\\n\\nCycle structure: two 2-cycles.\\n\\nFor a coloring to be fixed by g, must have color(A)=color(B), color(C)=color(D)\\n\\nAs before.\\n\\nAnd for validity: if color(A)=color(C), then all four same, invalid.\\n\\nIf color(A)≠color(C), then two of one color, two of another, valid.\\n\\nNumber of such colorings: choose color for A,B: 3 choices, color for C,D: 2 choices (different), so 6.\\n\\nSame as before.\\n\\nBut now, there are 3 such g, each has Fix(g)=6.\\n\\nFor 3-cycles, say g=(ABC), cycle structure: (A B C)(D)\\n\\nFixed coloring requires color(A)=color(B)=color(C), color(D) arbitrary.\\n\\nBut then A,B,C same color, so face ABC monochromatic, invalid.\\n\\nSo no valid coloring is fixed by g, so Fix(g)=0.\\n\\nThere are 8 such g.\\n\\nIdentity: Fix=54.\\n\\nSum = 1*54 + 3*6 + 8*0 = 54 + 18 = 72\\n\\nAverage = 72 / 12 = 6\\n\\nSo 6 distinct colorings.\\n\\nNow, intuitively: for type (2,2,0): choose which color is missing: 3 choices. But under rotation, all such are equivalent? No, because the coloring depends on the matching, but all matchings are equivalent, and the two colors are assigned.\\n\\nFor a fixed missing color, say green missing, then we color with red and blue, each twice.\\n\\nThe two red vertices can be any two, but since all pairs are equivalent, and the complement is the other pair.\\n\\nBut we assign which pair is red, which is blue.\\n\\nBut under rotation, can we swap the colors? Only if there is a rotation that swaps the two colors, but rotations don't change colors, they permute vertices.\\n\\nTo have a symmetry that swaps red and blue, it would need to map red vertices to blue, but since the two pairs are indistinguishable in structure, but the coloring is asymmetric if the colors are different.\\n\\nFor example, suppose we have a coloring with AB red, CD blue.\\n\\nIs there a rotation that turns this into AB blue, CD red? That would require swapping the colors, but rotations don't change colors, only permute vertices.\\n\\nTo make AB blue and CD red, we need to recolor, but in group action, we only permute vertices, not change colors.\\n\\nSo the coloring with AB red, CD blue is different from AB blue, CD red, unless there is a rotation that swaps the two pairs.\\n\\nBut a rotation that swaps the pair {A,B} with {C,D}? For example, a rotation that swaps A with C, B with D, but that would be (A C)(B D), which is a rotation.\\n\\nApply σ = (A C)(B D) to the coloring where A,B red, C,D blue.\\n\\nThen σ(A)=C, who was blue, so new color at A is blue.\\nSimilarly σ(B)=D, blue, so B blue.\\nσ(C)=A, red, so C red.\\nσ(D)=B, red, so D red.\\n\\nSo the new coloring has A blue, B blue, C red, D red.\\n\\nSo the pair {A,B} is now blue, {C,D} is red.\\n\\nSo it is the coloring where the first pair is blue, second red.\\n\\nBut originally we had first pair red, second blue.\\n\\nSo yes, this rotation transforms the coloring with AB red, CD blue to AB blue, CD red.\\n\\nTherefore, these two colorings are in the same orbit.\\n\\nMoreover, since all matchings are equivalent, all (2,2,0) colorings with a fixed pair of colors are in one orbit? No.\\n\\nIn this case, for fixed two colors, say red and blue, all ways to assign them to the two pairs are equivalent under rotation, because we can swap the assignment.\\n\\nAnd since all matchings are equivalent, yes.\\n\\nSo for each pair of colors, there is only one orbit.\\n\\nNumber of ways to choose two colors: C(3,2)=3.\\n\\nSo 3 orbits for (2,2,0) type.\\n\\nNow for (2,1,1): one color twice, others once.\\n\\nSay red used twice, blue and green once each.\\n\\nChoose which two vertices are red: but all pairs are equivalent, so without loss of generality, A and B red.\\n\\nThen C and D: one blue, one green.\\n\\nTwo choices: C blue, D green or C green, D blue.\\n\\nAre these equivalent under rotation?\\n\\nIs there a rotation that fixes A and B (as a set) and swaps C and D?\\n\\nRotations that preserve {A,B}: for example, the 180 degree rotation about the axis through midpoint of AB and midpoint of CD: this swaps A and B, and swaps C and D.\\n\\nSo it swaps C and D.\\n\\nTherefore, it swaps the two colorings: if C blue, D green, after swap, C green, D blue.\\n\\nSo yes, they are in the same orbit.\\n\\nMoreover, since we can map any pair to any other pair, all such colorings are in one orbit for fixed colors.\\n\\nBut the color that is used twice: we chose red.\\n\\nCould we have chosen blue or green?\\n\\nBut the situation is symmetric.\\n\\nFor example, a coloring with red twice, blue and green once, vs blue twice, red and green once.\\n\\nAre they in the same orbit? Only if there is a rotation that changes which color is duplicated, but rotations don't change colors, so no.\\n\\nTherefore, the orbit depends on which color is used twice.\\n\\nSo three possibilities: red duplicated, or blue, or green.\\n\\nBut earlier we said for each choice of the duplicated color, the rest is unique up to rotation.\\n\\nSo three orbits for (2,1,1) type.\\n\\nTotal orbits: 3 (from (2,2,0)) + 3 (from (2,1,1)) = 6.\\n\\nMatches our Burnside count.\\n\\nSo answer is 6.\\n\\nTherefore, final answers.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
