  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\n\\nWe are given:\\n- Total animals: 1000\\n- Ducks: 600\\n- Therefore, cows + rabbits = 400\\n- Let d = 600 (ducks), c = number of cows, r = number of rabbits → c + r = 400\\n\\nCondition: Every duck must either be standing next to at least one cow OR be between two rabbits.\\n\\nWe are to minimize the number of cows. That means we want to maximize the use of the 'between two rabbits' condition to satisfy ducks without needing cows.\\n\\nLet’s analyze what it means for a duck to be satisfied:\\n- Case 1: Duck is adjacent to at least one cow → then it's safe.\\n- Case 2: Duck is not adjacent to any cow → then it must be between two rabbits (i.e., both neighbors are rabbits).\\n\\nSo, if a duck is not adjacent to a cow, it must be in a configuration: R-D-R (rabbit-duck-rabbit)\\n\\nOur goal is to minimize c (number of cows), so we want as many ducks as possible to be satisfied by being between two rabbits, thus reducing the need for adjacency to cows.\\n\\nBut note: if a duck is between two rabbits, then that duck is isolated from cows. However, such ducks cannot be adjacent to cows — otherwise they’d be covered by the other rule, but that would waste a cow unnecessarily? Not necessarily, but our aim is to avoid using cows when possible.\\n\\nKey idea: To satisfy a duck without a cow, it must have both neighbors as rabbits.\\n\\nSo, suppose there is a block: R-D-R\\nThen the duck in the middle is satisfied.\\nThe rabbits on the ends may be used to satisfy other ducks.\\n\\nBut can two such R-D-R blocks share a rabbit?\\nSuppose: R-D-R-D-R → positions: R, D, R, D, R\\nLook at first duck (pos 2): neighbors R and R → good.\\nSecond duck (pos 4): neighbors R and R → also good.\\nMiddle rabbit (pos 3) is shared.\\nSo yes, a rabbit can serve in multiple R-D-R triples.\\n\\nIn fact, in the sequence: R-D-R-D-R, we have 2 ducks, each between two rabbits, using only 3 rabbits.\\nPattern: alternating R and D starting and ending with R → length 5: R,D,R,D,R → 2 ducks, 3 rabbits\\nSo ratio: 2 ducks per 3 rabbits → 2/3 efficiency\\n\\nMore generally, a maximal block of alternating R and D, starting and ending with R, will have:\\n- Number of rabbits = k+1\\n- Number of ducks = k\\nFor a segment of length 2k+1: R,D,R,D,...,R (k ducks, k+1 rabbits)\\n\\nSo to support k ducks via the 'between two rabbits' method, we need k+1 rabbits.\\nThus, for x ducks to be satisfied without cow adjacency, we need at least x+1 rabbits (if all are in one block), or possibly more if fragmented.\\nBut to minimize cows, we want to maximize the number of ducks that are between two rabbits, which requires rabbits.\\n\\nLet x = number of ducks that are NOT adjacent to any cow → these must be between two rabbits.\\nThen the remaining (600 - x) ducks must be adjacent to at least one cow.\\n\\nEach such duck (that needs cow adjacency) must have at least one neighbor that is a cow.\\nBut one cow can be adjacent to up to two ducks (on left and right).\\nSimilarly, a cow can help satisfy up to two ducks.\\n\\nBut also, cows can be adjacent to other cows, rabbits, etc.\\n\\nHowever, we are trying to minimize c, so we want to use cows as efficiently as possible to cover ducks that aren't covered by the R-D-R condition.\\n\\nMoreover, the x ducks that are between two rabbits do not require cow adjacency, so they can be isolated from cows.\\n\\nBut: if a duck is adjacent to a cow, it's satisfied.\\n\\nSo total ducks: 600\\nLet x = number of ducks that are *not* adjacent to any cow → must be between two rabbits.\\nThen 600 - x ducks are adjacent to at least one cow.\\n\\nNow, each cow has two neighbors. Each neighbor could be a duck that needs satisfying.\\nBut a cow might be adjacent to zero, one, or two ducks.\\nTo maximize efficiency, assume each cow is adjacent to two ducks that need satisfying.\\nThen the number of duck-satisfactions provided by cows is at most 2c.\\nBut each of the (600 - x) ducks needs at least one cow neighbor.\\nSo we need:\\n2c ≥ 600 - x  →  c ≥ (600 - x)/2\\n\\nAlso, the x ducks that are not adjacent to any cow must each be between two rabbits.\\nSo each such duck has both neighbors as rabbits.\\nNow, how many rabbits are needed to support x such ducks?\\n\\nThis is a classic covering problem.\\nConsider the subgraph (or subsequence) of ducks that are between two rabbits.\\nEach such duck is surrounded by rabbits.\\nMoreover, rabbits can be shared.\\n\\nAs in the earlier example: R-D-R-D-R → supports 2 ducks with 3 rabbits.\\nIn general, if we have a contiguous block of alternating R and D, starting and ending with R, of the form RDRDR...R, with k ducks, then we need k+1 rabbits.\\nAnd each duck is between two rabbits.\\n\\nCan we do better than k+1 rabbits for k ducks?\\nNo, because each duck takes two rabbit neighbors, but rabbits are shared.\\nTotal rabbit-adjacencies required: 2x (each of x ducks has two rabbit neighbors)\\nEach rabbit can provide up to two such adjacencies (left and right).\\nBut: if a rabbit is adjacent to two such ducks, that would mean: D-R-D\\nBut that would make the rabbit between two ducks.\\nBut those ducks would have this rabbit as a neighbor.\\nBut for a duck to be satisfied by being between two rabbits, both its neighbors must be rabbits.\\nSo if a duck has a neighbor that is a rabbit, but the other neighbor is a duck, then it is not between two rabbits.\\nTherefore, a duck that is in the 'must be between two rabbits' group cannot be adjacent to another duck.\\nWait — actually, nothing says it can’t be adjacent to another duck, but if a duck has a duck as a neighbor, then unless that other duck is also between two rabbits, it might not be satisfied.\\nBut crucially: if two such special ducks (the ones not adjacent to any cow) are adjacent to each other, say D-D, then each has a duck as neighbor.\\nBut then for such a duck to be satisfied, it must be between two rabbits — so both neighbors must be rabbits.\\nBut if it has a duck as neighbor, that’s not a rabbit → contradiction.\\nTherefore: no two ducks that are not adjacent to any cow can be adjacent to each other!\\nBecause if duck A is not adjacent to any cow, then both its neighbors must be rabbits.\\nSo it cannot have a duck as neighbor.\\nTherefore, the x ducks that are not adjacent to any cow must each be isolated from other ducks — in fact, each must be surrounded by rabbits.\\nMoreover, since they can’t be adjacent to other such ducks, there must be at least one non-duck (rabbit or cow) between them.\\nBut more: since they can’t be adjacent to any duck or cow, their neighbors must be rabbits.\\nSo each such duck must have both neighbors as rabbits.\\nAnd since they can’t be adjacent to another duck, the arrangement around them must be R-D-R\\nAnd the next duck of this type must be separated by at least one animal.\\nBut also, the rabbits can be shared only if the separation allows it.\\nBut consider: can we have R-D-R-D-R? That’s two ducks, each between two rabbits.\\nPositions: 1:R, 2:D, 3:R, 4:D, 5:R\\nDuck at 2: neighbors R and R → good\\nDuck at 4: neighbors R and R → good\\nAre they adjacent? Positions 2 and 4 are not adjacent; position 3 is between them.\\nBut duck at 2 and duck at 4 are not adjacent — good.\\nBut are they both not adjacent to any cow? Yes, assuming no cow nearby.\\nBut in this case, the rabbit at position 3 is shared.\\nSo we have two such ducks, using three rabbits.\\nIs this allowed? Yes.\\nBut now, what about the adjacency: duck at 2 has neighbors 1 and 3: both rabbits → good.\\nDuck at 4 has neighbors 3 and 5: both rabbits → good.\\nNo two such ducks are adjacent.\\nSo this is valid.\\n\\nIn fact, we can have a block: R-D-R-D-R-D-...-R with k ducks and k+1 rabbits.\\nEach duck is separated by a rabbit, so no two ducks are adjacent.\\nEach duck has two rabbit neighbors.\\nSo maximum number of such ducks we can have with r rabbits is at most r - 1.\\nBecause in a connected block, k ducks require k+1 rabbits.\\nBut if the rabbits are in multiple disjoint segments, say multiple R-D-R blocks, then each such block of one duck requires 3 rabbits: R-D-R\\nWhich gives 1 duck for 3 rabbits → worse than the chain.\\nOr two separate R-D-R: uses 6 rabbits for 2 ducks → 3 per duck.\\nWhile a single R-D-R-D-R uses 3 rabbits for 2 ducks → 1.5 per duck.\\nSo best to group them into one long alternating chain.\\nMaximum x (number of ducks not adjacent to any cow) is at most r - 1, achieved when rabbits and such ducks are arranged in a single maximal alternating block: R-D-R-D-...-R with x ducks and x+1 rabbits.\\nBut we only have r rabbits.\\nSo to support x such ducks, we need at least x+1 rabbits.\\nTherefore:\\nx ≤ r - 1\\n\\nSo x ≤ r - 1 → x ≤ (400 - c) - 1 = 399 - c\\n\\nAlso, from cow coverage:\\nNumber of ducks that need cow adjacency: 600 - x\\nEach cow can cover at most 2 such ducks (since each cow has two neighbors)\\nSo total coverage ≤ 2c\\nThus:\\n2c ≥ 600 - x  →  x ≥ 600 - 2c\\n\\nNow combine inequalities:\\nx ≥ 600 - 2c\\nx ≤ 399 - c\\nSo:\\n600 - 2c ≤ x ≤ 399 - c\\nTherefore:\\n600 - 2c ≤ 399 - c\\n→ 600 - 399 ≤ 2c - c\\n→ 201 ≤ c\\nSo c ≥ 201\\n\\nThus, minimal number of cows is at least 201.\\n\\nNow, is c = 201 achievable?\\nTry c = 201\\nThen r = 400 - 201 = 199\\nThen x ≤ r - 1 = 198\\nAlso, x ≥ 600 - 2c = 600 - 402 = 198\\nSo x ≥ 198 and x ≤ 198 → x = 198\\nSo exactly 198 ducks are not adjacent to any cow → must be between two rabbits\\nAnd 600 - 198 = 402 ducks must be adjacent to at least one cow\\nCows: 201 → can provide up to 402 adjacencies → exactly enough, so each cow must be adjacent to two ducks that need satisfying.\\n\\nNow, can we arrange this?\\nWe need:\\n- 198 ducks that are each between two rabbits, and not adjacent to any cow\\n- These 198 ducks must be separated (not adjacent to each other or to cows)\\n- And we have r = 199 rabbits\\n- x = 198 → need at least x+1 = 199 rabbits → exactly enough!\\nSo we can form a single block: R-D-R-D-...-R with 198 ducks and 199 rabbits → starts and ends with R, alternates.\\nThis block has length: 198 (ducks) + 199 (rabbits) = 397 animals\\n\\nNow, we have c = 201 cows\\nAnd the remaining ducks: 600 - 198 = 402 ducks that must be adjacent to cows\\nTotal animals: 1000\\nAnimals used in rabbit-duck block: 397\\nRemaining animals: 1000 - 397 = 603\\nThese must consist of: 402 ducks and 201 cows → 402 + 201 = 603 → perfect.\\n\\nNow, we need to arrange the remaining 402 ducks and 201 cows such that:\\n- The 402 ducks are each adjacent to at least one cow\\n- And the entire circle is connected\\n- Also, the block of 397 animals (R-D-R-...-R) must be placed in the circle, and the rest around\\n- But also, the interface between the blocks must not violate conditions\\n\\nCrucially, the 198 special ducks are not to be adjacent to any cow, so the animals adjacent to the R-D-R...R block must not be cows, or if they are, they must not be adjacent to those ducks.\\nBut the block starts and ends with a rabbit.\\nSay the block is: R-D-R-D-...-R (199 rabbits, 198 ducks, starts and ends with R)\\nSo the two ends are rabbits.\\nIf we place a cow next to one of these end rabbits, that’s fine, as long as the cow is not adjacent to a duck.\\nThe end rabbits are at the boundary.\\nSuppose we have ... - X - [block] - Y - ...\\nX and Y are the neighbors of the two end rabbits.\\nSince the end animals of the block are rabbits, X is adjacent to a rabbit (which is fine), and similarly Y.\\nIf X is a cow, then that cow is adjacent to a rabbit, which is fine.\\nBut we need to ensure that no cow is adjacent to any of the 198 special ducks.\\nThe special ducks are internal to the block, each surrounded by rabbits, so as long as we don’t attach anything directly to a duck, it’s fine.\\nSince the block is linear in arrangement, and we’re placing it in a circle, we just need to connect the two ends appropriately.\\nBut the block has two ends, both rabbits.\\nWe can attach the remaining 603 animals (402 ducks and 201 cows) to these ends.\\nBut we need to form a circle, so the entire thing must loop.\\nIdea: place the big R-D-R...R block (397 animals), then attach the remaining 603 animals as a chain that connects back.\\nBut we need to make sure that the connections don’t cause a cow to be adjacent to a special duck.\\nSince the block ends with rabbits, and we attach, say, a cow to one end, that cow is adjacent to a rabbit, not a duck — so ok.\\nSimilarly, the other end.\\nNow, within the remaining 603 animals: 402 ducks and 201 cows.\\nWe need every one of these 402 ducks to be adjacent to at least one cow.\\nAnd we have 201 cows, each can cover up to 2 ducks.\\nTotal capacity: 402 → exactly enough.\\nSo we need an arrangement where each cow is between two ducks, i.e., a pattern like D-C-D-C-D-... but wait, that would be alternating.\\nBut if we do D-C-D-C-...-D, then each cow is between two ducks, so covers two ducks.\\nNumber of ducks: let’s say we have c cows, then if we alternate D-C-D-C-...-D, we get c+1 ducks and c cows.\\nBut we have 402 ducks and 201 cows.\\nSo if we do a block: D-C-D-C-...-D with 201 cows and 202 ducks? No.\\nPattern: start with D, then C, D, C, ..., D → number of D's = number of C's + 1\\nSo for 201 cows, we get 202 ducks.\\nBut we have 402 ducks to place — too many.\\nWe need to cover 402 ducks with 201 cows, each cow covering two ducks.\\nSo ideal: each cow is adjacent to two ducks.\\nThat happens if every cow is between two ducks: D-C-D\\nBut if we have multiple such, we can do: D-C-D-C-D-C-... → alternating.\\nIn this case, for k cows, we have k+1 ducks? No: positions: D,C,D,C,D → 3 ducks, 2 cows → ducks = cows + 1\\nStill not good.\\nWe need ducks = 2 * cows?\\nOnly if cows are isolated, but each duck still needs one cow neighbor.\\nBut one cow can serve two ducks if it is between them: D-C-D → one cow serves two ducks.\\nSo to serve 402 ducks, we need at least 201 cows (since 402 / 2 = 201), which we have.\\nSo we can partition the 402 ducks into 201 pairs, and for each pair, place a cow between them? But that would be D-D-C or something.\\nNo: to have one cow serve two ducks, we can have D-C-D → the cow is adjacent to both ducks, and each duck is adjacent to the cow.\\nSo in D-C-D, two ducks, one cow.\\nEach duck is adjacent to the cow → satisfied.\\nThe cow is adjacent to two ducks.\\nPerfect.\\nBut now, if we have multiple such triplets: D-C-D, D-C-D, etc.\\nBut if we concatenate: D-C-D-D-C-D → then the middle D-D: two ducks adjacent.\\nEach of those ducks: the first D in the pair has neighbors: C and D\\nThe second D has neighbors: D and C\\nSo each has one cow neighbor → still satisfied, since they are adjacent to a cow.\\nBut the middle two ducks are adjacent to each other and each has a cow on one side.\\nSo still ok.\\nBut we can do better: just make a long chain: D-C-D-C-D-C-...-D\\nWith 201 cows and 202 ducks? Still short.\\nWe need 402 ducks.\\nNote: in the pattern D-C-D-C-...-D, with c cows, we have c+1 ducks.\\nNot enough.\\nAlternative: group as blocks of D-C-D, each using one cow and two ducks.\\nThen for 201 cows, we can have 201 * 2 = 402 ducks.\\nPerfect.\\nEach block: D-C-D → 3 animals: two ducks, one cow.\\nBut if we put them together: D-C-D-D-C-D-D-C-D...\\nThen between blocks: ...D-D...\\nSo two ducks adjacent.\\nBut each of those ducks has a cow neighbor (the one in its triplet), so they are adjacent to a cow → satisfied.\\nFor example, take two blocks: D-C-D and D-C-D\\nConcatenate: D-C-D-D-C-D\\nPositions: 1:D, 2:C, 3:D, 4:D, 5:C, 6:D\\nDuck at 1: neighbors? Assume linear for now: only one neighbor (2:C) → but in a circle, boundary matters, but within chain, internal.\\nIn the middle of the chain: duck at 3: neighbors 2:C and 4:D → has a cow neighbor → ok\\nDuck at 4: neighbors 3:D and 5:C → has a cow neighbor → ok\\nSimilarly, all ducks have at least one cow neighbor (in fact, ducks at ends of triplets have one cow neighbor, internal ducks like 3 and 4 have one cow and one duck)\\nSo all satisfied.\\nWe can make 201 such triplets: each D-C-D, but when concatenated, it becomes: D-C-D-D-C-D-D-C-D-...-D-C-D\\nHow many animals? Each triplet adds 3 animals, but when joined, the last D of one and first D of next are adjacent, but we don’t double count.\\nActually, if we have m such triplets, and we join them end to end, sharing the connecting D's?\\nNo: each triplet is D-C-D, three distinct animals.\\nWhen we concatenate: first triplet: D1-C1-D2\\nSecond triplet: D3-C2-D4\\nBut if we put them together: D1-C1-D2-D3-C2-D4\\nSo animals: D1,C1,D2,D3,C2,D4 → six animals for two triplets: four ducks, two cows.\\nYes: 2 triplets → 4 ducks, 2 cows.\\nIn general, m triplets → 2m ducks, m cows, and when joined, total animals: 2m + m = 3m? No: in the sequence, number of animals is: for m triplets, we have m cows and 2m ducks, total 3m animals.\\nBut in the concatenation, no sharing of animals — each animal is distinct.\\nSo for 201 triplets: 201 cows, 402 ducks, total 603 animals — perfect.\\nSequence: D-C-D-D-C-D-D-C-D-...-D-C-D\\nWith 201 occurrences of \\\"C-D\\\" but starts with D, then C,D, then D,C,D, etc.\\nActually: starts with D, then for each cow: C followed by D, but after the first D, we have C-D repeated 201 times? Let's see:\\nAfter first D, we have: C-D (cow1, duck2), then D (duck3), C-D (cow2, duck4), then D (duck5), etc.\\nBetter: the pattern is: D, then (C, D, D) repeated? No.\\nFrom above: D-C-D-D-C-D-D-C-D...\\nSo after the initial D, it's (C-D-D) repeated, but last one might differ.\\nCount: positions:\\n1: D\\n2: C\\n3: D\\n4: D\\n5: C\\n6: D\\n7: D\\n8: C\\n9: D\\n...\\nSo the pattern is: D, then (C, D, D) repeated 200 times? No.\\nFrom position 2 onwards: C,D,D,C,D,D,... but after first C,D, we have D again.\\nActually, it's: D, then for each of the 201 cows: insert C and then a D, but since the D's are shared?\\nNo, each \\\"D-C-D\\\" block contributes two new ducks and one cow.\\nWhen joining, the last D of one block is not shared with the next block's first D — they are distinct.\\nSo total: 201 blocks × (2 ducks + 1 cow) = 402 ducks, 201 cows, 603 animals.\\nArranged as: [D-C-D] [D-C-D] ... [D-C-D] but when concatenated: D-C-D-D-C-D-D-C-D-...-D-C-D\\nSo the sequence has: starts with D, ends with D, and has \\\"C-D\\\" 201 times, but also extra D's in between.\\nSpecifically, between each \\\"C-D\\\" and the next, there is an additional D? From above: after first C-D (positions 2,3), we have position 4: D, then 5:C, 6:D → so after each \\\"C-D\\\", there is an extra D before the next C, except possibly at ends.\\nIn the sequence: D(1), C(2), D(3), D(4), C(5), D(6), D(7), C(8), D(9), ...\\nSo the pattern is: D, then (C, D, D) repeated? But (C,D,D) has one C and two D's.\\nFor 201 cows, we need 201 such groups? But each (C,D,D) has one C and two D's, so 201 of them would give 201 C and 402 D, plus the initial D? No, if we start with (C,D,D), but we started with D already.\\nActually, the entire sequence can be seen as: a sequence of 402 ducks and 201 cows, with cows placed such that each cow is preceded and followed by a duck? But not necessarily.\\nFrom the construction: we have 201 instances of \\\"C-D\\\", but also the ducks are more.\\nNote that in the string \\\"D-C-D-D-C-D-D-C-D...\\\", the cows are always between two ducks: each C has a D on left and right.\\nFor example, C at pos 2: left D1, right D3 → both ducks\\nC at pos 5: left D4, right D6 → both ducks\\nSimilarly all.\\nAnd each duck: let's check:\\n- Duck at 1: neighbors? In the chain, left: ? (boundary), right: C2 → so if in isolation, only one neighbor, but in circle, will be connected.\\nSimilarly, duck at 3: neighbors C2 and D4 → has cow neighbor\\nDuck at 4: neighbors D3 and C5 → has cow neighbor\\nDuck at 6: neighbors C5 and D7 → has cow neighbor\\nAll ducks have at least one cow neighbor, since even the 'internal' ducks like 4,7, etc. have a cow on one side.\\nThe only potential issue is the very first and last ducks in this chain, but they will be connected to other parts.\\n\\nNow, back to the whole circle.\\nWe have:\\n- Block A: the R-D-R-D-...-R block with 199 rabbits and 198 ducks, total 397 animals. It starts and ends with R.\\n- Block B: the D-C-D-D-C-D-...-D-C-D block with 402 ducks and 201 cows, total 603 animals. It starts and ends with D.\\n\\nTotal: 397 + 603 = 1000.\\n\\nNow, arrange in a circle: place block A, then block B, connected end to end.\\nSo sequence: [A] then [B]\\nEnd of A: last animal is R\\nStart of B: first animal is D\\nSo connection: ...R (end of A) - D (start of B)...\\nNow, the R is from block A, which is a rabbit, neighbor to the last duck in A? The last few of A: ...R-D-R (since ends with R)\\nSuppose the last three: position -2: D, -1: R (last of A)? No.\\nBlock A: starts with R, ends with R, and alternates.\\nLength 397: odd.\\nPositions: 1:R, 2:D, 3:R, 4:D, ..., 397:R\\nSince starts and ends with R, and alternates, the odd positions are R, even are D.\\nSo position 397 (odd) is R.\\nPosition 396: even → D\\nSo last two: 396:D, 397:R\\nThen next: 1 of B: D\\nSo sequence: ...D (396), R (397), D (1B), ...\\nNow, look at the animals:\\n- Duck at 396: neighbors: 395 and 397\\n395: odd position → R\\n397: R\\nSo neighbors: R and R → so this duck is between two rabbits → it is one of the 198 special ducks, not adjacent to any cow → good, and satisfied.\\n- Rabbit at 397: neighbors: 396:D and 1B:D → both ducks\\n- Duck at 1B: neighbors: 397:R and 2B:C (since B starts D-C-D... so 2B is C)\\nSo duck at 1B has neighbors R and C → so it is adjacent to a cow (C at 2B) → therefore, it is satisfied (by cow adjacency)\\nAnd it is one of the 402 ducks that need cow adjacency → good.\\n\\nNow, is there any problem?\\nThe rabbit at 397 is adjacent to two ducks: one from A (special) and one from B (normal).\\nNo issue.\\nThe special duck at 396 is adjacent to R (395) and R (397) → both rabbits → good, not adjacent to cow.\\nThe normal duck at 1B is adjacent to R (397) and C (2B) → has cow neighbor → good.\\n\\nNow, the other end: end of B and start of A.\\nEnd of B: last animal is D (since ends with D)\\nStart of A: first animal is R (position 1)\\nSo connection: ...D (end of B) - R (1A)...\\nLast of B: since B ends with D, and the pattern is ...C-D (last two), so second last is C, last is D.\\nSo position end-1: C, end: D\\nThen next: 1A: R\\nSo sequence: ...C, D, R...\\nDuck at end of B: neighbors: C (previous) and R (next) → has cow neighbor → satisfied.\\nRabbit at 1A: neighbors: D (end of B) and 2A:D (since A: pos1:R, pos2:D) → so neighbors D and D → both ducks.\\nNo issue.\\n\\nNow, check all special ducks: the 198 in block A.\\nEach is at even positions: 2,4,6,...,396\\nFor a duck at even position i (2≤i≤396), neighbors: i-1 and i+1\\ni-1: odd → R, i+1: odd → R → both rabbits → so satisfied, and not adjacent to cow.\\nGood.\\n\\nThe ducks in block B: all are adjacent to at least one cow, as established earlier (each is in a D-C-D or similar context, and specifically, in the chain, every duck is next to a cow either on left or right or both).\\nFor example, a duck that is immediately after a C: like position 3B: after C2, so neighbors C2 and D4 → has cow.\\nA duck that is before a C: like if there is a D before C, but in our pattern, C is always preceded by D (since ...D-C-D...), so yes.\\nIn fact, in the D-C-D-D-C-D... pattern, the only ducks that might be questionable are the ones between two D's, like position 4B: neighbors D3 and C5 → has C5 on right → good.\\nSimilarly, all have at least one cow neighbor.\\n\\nCows: each is between two ducks, so adjacent to two ducks, all good.\\n\\nRabbits: some in A are adjacent to ducks, some to other rabbits? In A, the rabbits at odd positions: 1,3,5,...,397\\nFor an internal rabbit, say position 3: neighbors 2:D and 4:D → both ducks\\nSimilarly, position 1: neighbors 397 (from circle) and 2:D\\n397 is R, 2 is D → so neighbors R and D\\nSimilarly, position 397: neighbors 396:D and 1B:D → both ducks\\nAll rabbits are fine.\\n\\nNo animal is misclassified.\\n\\nThus, with c=201, r=199, it works.\\n\\nTherefore, minimal number of cows is 201.\\n\\nBut the problem does not ask for the minimal number of cows.\\nIt says: “Instead of determining the minimal number of cows required, simply find k = r - 198, where r is the number of rabbits in the arrangement that achieves this minimum.”\\n\\nWe achieved the minimum with r = 199\\nSo k = r - 198 = 199 - 198 = 1\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 1: k = 1\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nFind the largest integer n such that there exists a set of n points in the plane such that for any choice of three of them, some two are unit distance apart.\\n\\nThis is a known type of problem in combinatorial geometry.\\n\\nWe want that in every triple of points, at least one pair is at distance 1.\\n\\nEquivalently, there is no triple where all pairs are not at unit distance.\\n\\nWe want to maximize n.\\n\\nKnown results: this is related to the concept of a graph where edges represent unit distance, and we want that every three vertices have at least one edge — that is, the complement graph has no triangles — i.e., the complement is triangle-free.\\n\\nBut more precisely: define a graph G with vertices as points, and edge between two points if they are unit distance apart.\\nThen the condition is that every three vertices have at least one edge in G.\\nThat is, G has no independent set of size 3.\\nIn other words, the independence number α(G) ≤ 2.\\n\\nWe want to embed such a graph in the plane with straight-line unit distances.\\n\\nBut the graph is determined by the embedding: two points are adjacent iff distance is exactly 1.\\n\\nWe need the largest n such that there is a unit distance graph in the plane with independence number at most 2.\\n\\nThat is, the largest n where the unit distance graph on n points has no three mutually non-adjacent vertices.\\n\\nKnown examples:\\n- Equilateral triangle: n=3, all pairs distance 1 → complete graph → α=1\\n- Square with side 1: points A,B,C,D: AB=BC=CD=DA=1, AC=BD=√2 ≠1 → so edges only on sides.\\nGraph: cycle of 4. Independence number: can take two opposite vertices, e.g., A and C: distance √2 ≠1, so no edge → independent set of size 2.\\nCan we take three? Any three include two adjacent (since C4 has no independent set of size 3) → α=2.\\nCheck triples: any three points include at least two that are adjacent (e.g., A,B,C: A-B are adjacent). So yes, satisfies.\\n- Regular pentagon with side 1: diagonal is (1+√5)/2 ≈1.618 ≠1, so only side edges.\\nCycle C5. Independence number: floor(5/2)=2? Can take two non-adjacent, but not three. Max independent set size 2. So α=2.\\nAny three vertices in C5 include at least two adjacent? Yes, because if not, it would be an independent set of size 3, but α=2. So yes.\\n- Regular hexagon with side 1: diagonals: short diagonal √3≈1.732, long diagonal 2, neither is 1. So only side edges: C6.\\nIndependence number: 3 (every other vertex). For example, vertices 1,3,5: distances: 1-3: √3≠1, 1-5: √3≠1, 3-5: √3≠1, so no edges between them → independent set of size 3.\\nTriple {1,3,5}: no two are at unit distance → violates condition.\\nSo hexagon doesn't work.\\n\\nBut perhaps add more points.\\n\\nKnown result: the Moser spindle has 7 points, but let's think.\\n\\nWe can have larger sets.\\n\\nAnother idea: all points on a line.\\nSuppose points on a line at positions such that unit distance occurs.\\nBut hard to avoid large independent sets.\\n\\nBetter: use a set where many pairs are at unit distance.\\n\\nComplete graph: if all pairs at unit distance, but in plane, only up to 3 points (equilateral triangle).\\n\\nSo need a dense unit distance graph.\\n\\nKnown that the maximum is 7?\\nRecall: there is a set of 7 points: the vertices of a regular hexagon plus center.\\nLet’s try.\\nRegular hexagon, side length 1.\\nVertices: A,B,C,D,E,F in order.\\nCenter O.\\nDistances:\\n- OA = OB = ... = OF = 1 (since in regular hexagon, radius equals side)\\n- AB = BC = ... = FA = 1\\n- Diagonals: AC = √3 ≈1.732 ≠1, AD=2≠1, etc.\\nSo unit distances: all radii and all sides.\\nSo edges: O to each vertex, and each consecutive pair of vertices.\\nGraph: wheel graph W6 (6-cycle with hub).\\nVertices: O,A,B,C,D,E,F → 7 points.\\nNow, independence number: can we find three points with no two at unit distance?\\nSuppose we try to pick three points with no edge between any pair.\\nFirst, cannot pick O and any vertex, since O is connected to all.\\nSo if we pick O, we cannot pick any other point.\\nSo any independent set containing O has size 1.\\nNow, without O: the outer cycle A,B,C,D,E,F with edges AB,BC,CD,DE,EF,FA.\\nThis is C6, which has independent sets of size 3: e.g., A,C,E.\\nCheck distances: A to C: in hexagon, angle 120°, so AC = 2*sin(60°) = 2*(√3/2) = √3 ≈1.732 ≠1\\nA to E: opposite, distance 2≠1\\nC to E: similarly √3≠1\\nSo no unit distance between A,C,E.\\nThus, {A,C,E} is an independent set of size 3.\\nTriple {A,C,E}: no two at unit distance → violates the condition.\\nSo this set of 7 does not work.\\n\\nBut perhaps modify.\\nMake side length s such that some diagonal is 1.\\nBut complicated.\\n\\nAnother idea: equilateral triangle with midpoints.\\nOr known configurations.\\n\\nI recall that the maximum is 6.\\nBut earlier pentagon works, n=5.\\nSquare works, n=4.\\nCan we do n=6?\\n\\nTry a regular pentagon with an extra point.\\nOr consider the following: two equilateral triangles sharing a side: a rhombus with 60° angles.\\nPoints: A,B,C,D.\\nTriangle ABC equilateral, side 1.\\nTriangle ABD equilateral, on the other side.\\nSo points: A,B,C,D.\\nDistances: AB=BC=CA=1, AB=BD=DA=1.\\nAC=1, AD=1, BC=1, BD=1.\\nCD: distance between C and D.\\nAngle at A: 60°+60°=120°, so CD = 2*sin(60°) = 2*(√3/2)=√3≈1.732≠1\\nSo edges: all pairs except C-D.\\nSo graph: K4 minus one edge.\\nVertices A,B,C,D.\\nMissing edge: C-D.\\nNow, independence number: can we find three independent vertices?\\nAny three vertices: \\n- A,B,C: all connected → has edges\\n- A,B,D: all connected\\n- A,C,D: A-C, A-D present, C-D missing → but A-C and A-D are edges, so not independent\\n- B,C,D: B-C, B-D present, C-D missing → has edges\\nSo every three vertices include at least one edge? Actually, more: at least two edges.\\nBut the condition is satisfied for n=4.\\nBut we want larger.\\nAdd a fifth point.\\n\\nAnother idea: the vertices of a regular triangle with all midpoints.\\nEquilateral triangle ABC, side 1.\\nMidpoints: M_a, M_b, M_c of BC, CA, AB.\\nDistances:\\n- AB=BC=CA=1\\n- AM_c = BM_c = 0.5 (since midpoint)\\n- M_c to M_a: distance between midpoints.\\nIn triangle, M_c M_a: connects mid of AB to mid of BC.\\nBy midpoint theorem, M_c M_a parallel to AC and half length → so 0.5\\nSimilarly, all mid-mid distances are 0.5\\nM_c to C: distance from mid AB to C.\\nIn equilateral triangle, height √3/2, so distance from M_c to C: sqrt( (0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ) no.\\nCoordinates: place A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0.5, √3/2)\\nThen M_c = mid AB = (0.5, 0)\\nM_a = mid BC = ((1+0.5)/2, (0+√3/2)/2) = (0.75, √3/4)\\nM_b = mid CA = ((0+0.5)/2, (0+√3/2)/2) = (0.25, √3/4)\\nNow, distances:\\n- M_c to M_a: from (0.5,0) to (0.75, √3/4) = dx=0.25, dy=√3/4, dist = sqrt(0.25^2 + (√3/4)^2) = sqrt(0.0625 + 3/16) = sqrt(0.0625 + 0.1875) = sqrt(0.25) = 0.5\\nSimilarly all.\\n- M_c to C: (0.5,0) to (0.5, √3/2) = dx=0, dy=√3/2, dist=√3/2≈0.866≠1\\n- A to M_c: (0,0) to (0.5,0) = 0.5\\n- A to M_b: (0,0) to (0.25, √3/4) = sqrt(0.25^2 + (√3/4)^2) = sqrt(0.0625 + 0.1875) = sqrt(0.25)=0.5\\nSimilarly.\\n- M_b to M_c: (0.25, √3/4) to (0.5,0) = dx=0.25, dy=-√3/4, dist=sqrt(0.0625 + 0.1875)=sqrt(0.25)=0.5\\nNow, unit distance: only if dist=1.\\nCurrently, only AB,BC,CA are 1.\\nAll others are 0.5 or √3/2≈0.866, not 1.\\nSo only edges are the three sides.\\nGraph: three edges forming a triangle, and three isolated points? No, the midpoints are connected?\\nNo, no unit distance involving midpoints, since all dist <1.\\nSo the unit distance graph has only three edges: AB,BC,CA.\\nThen independent set: e.g., M_a, M_b, M_c: all pairs dist 0.5≠1, so no edges → independent set of size 3.\\nTriple {M_a,M_b,M_c}: no two at unit distance → violates.\\nSo not good.\\n\\nTo make some distances 1, perhaps scale.\\nBut if we scale so that M_c to C is 1, then original side becomes 2/(√3) *1 ≈ 1.154, not 1, and we lose the side lengths.\\nHard.\\n\\nBack to known results.\\nI recall that the maximum is 7, achieved by the Moser spindle, but Moser spindle has 7 points, but let's check its properties.\\nMoser spindle: two rhombi each made of two equilateral triangles, sharing a common vertex, and linked by an edge.\\nStandard Moser spindle: points A,B,C,D and A,E,F,G, with ABC equilateral, ACD equilateral (so B and D on opposite sides of AC), similarly AEF equilateral, AGF equilateral, and then add edge between, say, D and G, but adjusted so that DG=1.\\nTypically, it's used to show chromatic number at least 4.\\nBut for our purpose.\\nIn Moser spindle, there are 7 points, and it is unit distance graph.\\nBut does it have independence number 2?\\nI think not; likely has independent set of size 3.\\n\\nPerhaps search for the maximum clique in unit distance graph with high minimum degree, but we need low independence number.\\n\\nAnother idea: complete bipartite graph.\\nFor example, K_{3,3} can be embedded with unit distances?\\nK_{3,3} has 6 vertices.\\nCan we place two sets of three points each, such that each point in one set is at unit distance from each in the other, but not within set.\\nSo, three red points, three blue points, every red-blue pair at distance 1, no red-red or blue-blue at distance 1.\\nIs this possible in the plane?\\nSuppose the three red points are not collinear. Then the set of points at unit distance from a red point is a circle.\\nA blue point must be at intersection of three circles (unit distance from each red point).\\nThree circles intersect in at most one point, generally.\\nBut we need three such blue points.\\nSuppose the three red points form a triangle.\\nThen the points at unit distance from all three are the intersections of three circles.\\nGenerally, three circles intersect in at most one point, so at most one such blue point.\\nCannot have three.\\nIf the three red points are collinear, say on a line.\\nThen the set of points at unit distance from a point on the line is two lines parallel? No, circle.\\nFor three collinear points, the circles may intersect.\\nSuppose red points at (0,0), (d,0), (e,0).\\nThen a point (x,y) at distance 1 from all three:\\nx^2 + y^2 =1\\n(x-d)^2 + y^2 =1\\n(x-e)^2 + y^2 =1\\nSubtract first and second: (x-d)^2 - x^2 =0 → x^2 -2dx +d^2 -x^2=0 → -2dx +d^2=0 → x=d/2\\nSimilarly from first and third: x=e/2\\nSo d/2 = e/2 → d=e, contradiction unless d=e.\\nSo only if all red points are the same, impossible.\\nThus, cannot have even one blue point at unit distance from three non-collinear red points, unless they are concyclic or something, but generally impossible.\\nSo K_{3,3} not realizable as unit distance graph.\\n\\nK_{2,3}: possible.\\nTwo points A,B, and three points C,D,E, each of C,D,E at unit distance from both A and B.\\nSo C,D,E on the intersection of two circles: circle center A radius 1, circle center B radius 1.\\nIf |AB|<2, the two circles intersect at two points, say P and Q.\\nSo only two points at unit distance from both A and B.\\nThus, can have at most two such points, not three.\\nSo K_{2,3} is possible with two points, but not three.\\nSo maximum for this is K_{2,2}, a rectangle or something.\\n\\nBack to the problem.\\nI found online or recall that the maximum is 7, but let me think of the solution.\\nAnother idea: the vertices of a regular pentagon with side 1, and the center, but in regular pentagon, distance from center to vertex is not 1.\\nSet side length s, then radius r = s / (2 sin(36°)) ≈ s / 0.704 ≈ 1.42s\\nSet r=1, then s≈0.704, not 1.\\nSet s=1, r≈1.42≠1.\\nSo not unit.\\nBut perhaps make both happen by adjusting, but can't.\\n\\nPerhaps a different configuration.\\nConsider an equilateral triangle of side 1, and on each side, add a point to make a smaller equilateral triangle outward.\\nLike a Star of David but with triangles.\\nSo start with triangle ABC.\\nOn side AB, add point D such that ABD is equilateral.\\nOn side BC, add point E such that BCE is equilateral.\\nOn side CA, add point F such that CAF is equilateral.\\nSo now points: A,B,C,D,E,F.\\nDistances:\\n- AB=BC=CA=1\\n- AD=BD=1 (since ABD equilateral)\\n- BE=CE=1\\n- CF=AF=1\\nNow, distance between D and E, etc.\\nAlso, D to C, etc.\\nThis might be messy.\\nNote that D is at 60° from AB, etc.\\nIn fact, this is the hexagram.\\nPoints D,E,F are added.\\nNow, distance D to F: depends.\\nBut likely not 1.\\nMoreover, we can compute.\\nPlace A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0.5, √3/2)\\nThen D, for triangle ABD outward: since ABC is upward, outward might be downward.\\nAssume ABD is below AB.\\nSo D: rotate B around A by -60°, or use formula.\\nFrom A to B: (1,0)\\nRotate by -60° around A: (1*cos(-60) - 0*sin(-60), 1*sin(-60) + 0*cos(-60)) = (0.5, -√3/2)\\nSo D(0.5, -√3/2)\\nSimilarly, on BC: B(1,0), C(0.5, √3/2)\\nVector BC = (-0.5, √3/2)\\nRotate by -60° around B to get E.\\nRotation matrix: cos(-60)=0.5, sin(-60)=-√3/2\\nSo vector: (-0.5, √3/2)\\nRotated: x' = 0.5*(-0.5) - (-√3/2)*(√3/2) = -0.25 - (-3/4) = -0.25 + 0.75 = 0.5\\ny' = (-√3/2)*(-0.5) + 0.5*(√3/2) = (√3/4) + (√3/4) = √3/2\\nThen E = B + (x',y') = (1,0) + (0.5, √3/2) = (1.5, √3/2)\\nSimilarly, on CA: C(0.5, √3/2), A(0,0)\\nVector CA = (-0.5, -√3/2)\\nRotate by -60° around C.\\nRotated vector: x' = 0.5*(-0.5) - (-√3/2)*(-√3/2) = -0.25 - (3/4) = -1\\ny' = (-√3/2)*(-0.5) + 0.5*(-√3/2) = (√3/4) - (√3/4) = 0\\nSo F = C + (x',y') = (0.5, √3/2) + (-1,0) = (-0.5, √3/2)\\nNow, points: A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0.5, √3/2), D(0.5, -√3/2), E(1.5, √3/2), F(-0.5, √3/2)\\nNow, unit distances: we have AB,BC,CA, AD,BD, BE,CE, CF,AF all =1 by construction.\\nNow, other distances: e.g., D to E: (0.5,-√3/2) to (1.5, √3/2) = dx=1, dy=√3, dist=sqrt(1+3)=2≠1\\nD to F: (0.5,-√3/2) to (-0.5, √3/2) = dx=-1, dy=√3, dist=sqrt(1+3)=2\\nD to C: (0.5,-√3/2) to (0.5, √3/2) = dx=0, dy=√3, dist=√3≈1.732≠1\\nE to F: (1.5, √3/2) to (-0.5, √3/2) = dx=-2, dy=0, dist=2\\nA to E: (0,0) to (1.5, √3/2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.75) = sqrt(3)≈1.732\\nB to F: (1,0) to (-0.5, √3/2) = dx=-1.5, dy=√3/2, dist=sqrt(2.25 + 0.75)=sqrt(3)\\nC to D: already did, √3\\nNow, is there any other unit distance? Probably not.\\nNow, check for independent set of size 3.\\nFor example, take D, E, F.\\nD to E: 2≠1, D to F:2≠1, E to F:2≠1, so no edges between them.\\nAre there edges? Only if distance 1, which is not.\\nSo {D,E,F} is an independent set of size 3.\\nTriple {D,E,F}: no two at unit distance → violates.\\nSo not good.\\n\\nPerhaps make it inward, but might be worse.\\n\\nAfter research in memory, I recall that the maximum is 7, and it is achieved by the following: take a regular hexagon with side length 1, but not the standard one.\\nOr rather, the solution is n=7.\\nBut earlier wheel didn't work.\\nAnother idea: the vertices of two equilateral triangles that are rotated.\\nOr the Johnson solid, but in plane.\\n\\nI found that in some sources, the maximum is 7.\\nFor example, take a point, and six points around it at unit distance, but then the six points are on a circle of radius 1, and if they are at 60 degrees, then adjacent are at distance 1, but then it's the wheel, which has independent set of size 3 on the rim.\\nUnless we make the angular separation such that no two on rim are at unit distance.\\nSuppose the six points on the circle are not at mutual unit distance.\\nDistance between two points on circle of radius 1, angle θ, is 2 sin(θ/2).\\nSet this ≠1 for all pairs.\\n2 sin(θ/2) =1 → sin(θ/2)=0.5 → θ/2=30° or 150°, so θ=60° or 300°.\\nSo as long as no two are at 60° or 300° apart, distance not 1.\\nBut in a regular hexagon, they are at 60° intervals, so adjacent at 60°, distance 2*sin(30°)=2*0.5=1, which is unit, which we don't want.\\nSo make irregular.\\nPlace six points on the circle at angles that are not 60° apart.\\nFor example, at 0°, 50°, 100°, 170°, 220°, 300°.\\nThen calculate pairwise distances, ensure none is 1.\\nBut also, the center is at unit distance to all six.\\nSo edges: center to each of six.\\nNo other edges, if we can make all rim-rim distances ≠1.\\nIs that possible?\\nWe need that for any two of the six, 2|sin((θ_i-θ_j)/2)| ≠1.\\nSince the circle is continuous, and the set of bad angles is closed, we can choose angles to avoid the values where distance is 1.\\nFor example, the distance is 1 when |θ_i - θ_j| = 60° or 300° (but 300° is same as -60°, distance same as 60°), or also 360°-60°=300°, same.\\nActually, distance depends on smallest angle, so min(|θ_i-θ_j|, 360-|θ_i-θ_j|) = δ, then dist = 2 sin(δ/2)\\nSet equal to 1: 2 sin(δ/2) =1 → sin(δ/2)=0.5 → δ/2=30° or 150°, but δ≤180°, so δ/2≤90°, so δ/2=30° → δ=60°.\\nSo distance is 1 iff the angular separation is 60°.\\nOtherwise not.\\nSo if no two of the six points have angular separation 60°, then no rim-rim edge.\\nCan we place six points on a circle such that no two are at exactly 60° separation?\\nYes, easily. For example, place them at 0°, 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°, 5°.\\nThen separations are small, not 60°.\\nOr at 0°, 70°, 140°, 210°, 280°, 350°.\\nCheck separations: 70-0=70≠60, 140-70=70, 210-140=70, etc., and 350-280=70, 0-350+360=10, not 60.\\nAll differences are 70° or 10°, not 60°.\\nSo no two at 60° separation, so no unit distance between rim points.\\nNow, center O to each rim point: distance 1, so edges.\\nSo the unit distance graph has edges only from O to each of the six rim points.\\nSo it's a star K_{1,6}.\\nNow, independence number: can we find three points with no two at unit distance?\\nTake three rim points, say at 0°,70°,140°.\\nDistance between any two: not 1, as ensured.\\nAnd no edge between them.\\nAlso, not connected to each other.\\nSo {P0,P70,P140} is an independent set of size 3.\\nTriple: no two at unit distance → violates.\\nSo still not good.\\n\\nTo prevent this, we need that among any three rim points, some two are at unit distance, but we've avoided that.\\nSo we need to add some rim-rim unit distances.\\nBut carefully.\\n\\nPerhaps make it so that the graph is complete multipartite or something.\\n\\nAfter some thought, I recall that the maximum is 7, and it is achieved by the following configuration: take a regular pentagon with side 1, and add two points, but it's complicated.\\n\\nUpon second thought, I found that in the literature, the maximum is 7.\\nFor example, the Moser spindle has 7 points, and although it has girth 3, let's check its independence number.\\nMoser spindle: typically, it has two diamonds.\\nPoints: A,B,C,D where A,B,C equilateral, A,C,D equilateral, so B and D on opposite sides of AC.\\nSimilarly, A,E,F,G with A,E,F equilateral, A,F,G equilateral, and then add edge between D and G by making |DG|=1.\\nSo points: A,B,C,D,E,F,G — 7 points.\\nEdges: AB,BC,CA, AD,CD, and AE,EF,FA, FG,AG, and DG=1.\\nNow, is there an independent set of size 3?\\nSuppose we try B,E,C.\\nB to E: likely not 1, B to C: are they connected? In the first diamond, B and C are connected if |BC|=1, which it is, since ABC equilateral.\\nSo B-C edge.\\nSimilarly, many edges.\\nPerhaps B,E,G.\\nB to E: probably not 1, B to G: not necessarily, E to G: in the second diamond, E and G may not be directly connected.\\nIn A,E,F,G: AEF equilateral, AFG equilateral, so E and G are not necessarily adjacent.\\nDistance E to G: depends on the angle at A.\\nIf the two diamonds are in the same plane, and the angle between them is such that |EG| may not be 1.\\nTypically, in Moser spindle, the two diamonds are coplanar, and the angle is chosen so that |DG|=1, but |EG| may not be 1.\\nAssume that only the specified edges are unit distance.\\nSo edges are: AB,BC,CA, AD,CD, AE,EF,FA, FG,AG, DG.\\nNote that FA is listed twice, but once.\\nList: from first part: AB,BC,CA, AD,CD (since ACD equilateral, so AC,AD,CD, but AC already have)\\nAC is in both.\\nSo edges: AB,BC,CA, AD,CD, and AE,EF,FA, FG,AG, and DG.\\nFA is same as AF.\\nNow, vertices: A,B,C,D,E,F,G.\\nNow, try to find three vertices with no edge between any pair.\\nSuppose we take B,E,G.\\nB to E: is there an edge? Only if |BE|=1, but not specified, and generally not 1.\\nSimilarly, B to G: not specified.\\nE to G: not directly connected; in the graph, E is connected to A and F, G to A,F,D.\\nSo no edge between E and G, unless |EG|=1, which is not required.\\nSo if |BE|≠1, |BG|≠1, |EG|≠1, then {B,E,G} is independent.\\nIn the standard embedding, this may be the case.\\nFor example, if the two diamonds are on the same side or opposite.\\nTypically, to make |DG|=1, the angle is acute, and |BE| may not be 1.\\nSo likely {B,E,G} is an independent set.\\nSo not good.\\n\\nPerhaps a different configuration.\\nAfter research, I recall that the maximum is 6.\\nAnd it is achieved by the vertices of a regular pentagon with side 1, but that's 5.\\nOr the following: take an equilateral triangle, and on each side, add a point at the midpoint, but scaled.\\nAnother idea: the solution is n=7, and it is the following: points at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (0.5, 0.5 + sqrt(3)/2), and two more.\\nPerhaps give up and think logically.\\nSuppose we have n points.\\nThe unit distance graph has no independent set of size 3, so the independence number α ≤ 2.\\nBy Turán's theorem or something, but in geometric setting.\\nIn the plane, the maximum number of points with no three mutually at unit distance apart in the complement, but it's messy.\\nI recall that the maximum is 7, and it is tight.\\nUpon thinking, I found a configuration: the vertices of a regular hexagon with side length 1, but only if we include the center, but earlier didn't work.\\nBut in regular hexagon with side 1, distance from center to vertex is 1, and side is 1, but also short diagonal is √3≠1, long is 2.\\nBut as before, every other vertex are at distance √3≠1, so if we take three every other, distance √3≠1, so no unit distance.\\nBut if we make the side length such that the short diagonal is 1.\\nIn regular hexagon, short diagonal is √3 times side.\\nSet √3 * s = 1 → s = 1/√3\\nThen side = 1/√3 ≈0.577, not 1.\\nThen distance from center to vertex is s = 1/√3 ≠1.\\nSo not unit.\\nSo can't have both.\\n\\nPerhaps a non-regular configuration.\\nAfter some search in memory, I recall that the maximum is 7, and it is achieved by the following: start with a point O. Place three points A,B,C at unit distance from O, at 120 degrees. Then from A, place a point D at unit distance, not on the lines. Similarly from B, place E, from C, place F. Then adjust so that some distances are 1, but it's vague.\\n\\nI think the correct answer is 7.\\nAnd for the sake of time, I'll go with that.\\nBut let's box the answers.\\n\\nFor Problem 1, we have k=1.\\nFor Problem 2, I think the largest n is 7.\\nSo answer_2 = \"7\"\\n\\nBut let me confirm with a known result.\\nUpon final thought, I recall that in the plane, the maximum number of points such that every three contain a unit distance pair is 7.\\nOne such configuration is the Moser spindle, but as we saw, it may not work, but perhaps a different one.\\nAnother configuration: the vertices of a regular triangle with its three midpoints, but scaled.\\nSuppose equilateral triangle with side s, midpoints.\\nThen distance from vertex to midpoint is s/2.\\nSet s/2 =1, so s=2.\\nThen side=2, not 1.\\nDistance between midpoints is 1 (since half of side).\\nSo unit distances: vertex to midpoint: distance s/2=1, so yes.\\nMidpoint to midpoint: distance 1, as calculated earlier.\\nSo edges: each vertex to its two midpoints? No.\\nIn triangle ABC, side 2.\\nMidpoint M_a of BC, etc.\\nDistance A to M_a: in median, length (sqrt(2b^2+2c^2-a^2))/2 = for equilateral, a=b=c=2, so median = (sqrt(8+8-4))/2 = sqrt(12)/2 = 2√3/2 = √3 ≈1.732≠1.\\nOh, not 1.\\nIf s=2, A to M_a = height = (√3/2)*2 = √3 ≈1.732≠1.\\nEarlier I said s/2, but that's to the foot, but in equilateral, the median length is (√3/2)*s = (√3/2)*2 = √3 ≠1.\\nSo not 1.\\nTo make A to M_a =1, then (√3/2)*s =1 → s=2/√3\\nThen midpoint to midpoint: distance between M_b and M_c = half of BC = s/2 = 1/√3 ≈0.577≠1.\\nSo not unit.\\nSo not good.\\n\\nPerhaps accept that for Problem 2, the answer is 7.\\nOr maybe 6.\\nAnother idea: the complete graph K_4 can be embedded as a tetrahedron, but in plane, only if flat, but K_4 is planar, but unit distance.\\nCan we have four points in plane with all pairs at unit distance? Only if equilateral triangle, fourth point not possible.\\nMaximum clique is 3.\\nBut we don't need clique.\\n\\nI think the answer is 7.\\nSo I'll go with that.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"7\"\n}",
