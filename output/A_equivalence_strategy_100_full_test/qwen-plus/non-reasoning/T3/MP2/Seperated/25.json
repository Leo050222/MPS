We apply the linear transformation:\\n\\n    u = 3x + 2y\\n    v = x + 4y\\n\\nWe want to find the area of the region R ⊆ S such that (u, v) ∈ S, i.e., both u ≤ 1 and v ≤ 1.\\n\\nSo we require:\\n\\n    3x + 2y ≤ 1   ...(1)\\n    x + 4y ≤ 1    ...(2)\\n\\nalong with x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, x ≤ 1, y ≤ 1. But since we're inside the unit square, we only need to consider the intersection of the inequalities (1) and (2) with x, y ∈ [0,1].\\n\\nLet’s find the region in the (x,y)-plane where both inequalities hold and 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.\\n\\nStep 1: Find intersection points of the lines.\\n\\nLine 1: 3x + 2y = 1\\nWhen x=0: y = 1/2\\nWhen y=0: x = 1/3\\n\\nLine 2: x + 4y = 1\\nWhen x=0: y = 1/4\\nWhen y=0: x = 1\\n\\nNow find intersection of the two lines:\\n\\n3x + 2y = 1\\nx + 4y = 1 → multiply by 3: 3x + 12y = 3\\nSubtract: (3x + 12y) - (3x + 2y) = 3 - 1 → 10y = 2 → y = 1/5\\nThen x = 1 - 4*(1/5) = 1 - 4/5 = 1/5\\n\\nSo the two lines intersect at (1/5, 1/5)\\n\\nNow, let's determine the region satisfying:\\n\\n    3x + 2y ≤ 1\\n    x + 4y ≤ 1\\n    x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\\n\\nWe now find the polygon defined by these inequalities.\\n\\nVertices:\\n\\n- (0,0): satisfies both\\n- On x-axis: 3x ≤ 1 → x ≤ 1/3; also x ≤ 1 → so (1/3, 0) is on first line, check second: 1/3 + 0 = 1/3 ≤ 1 → OK\\nBut does (1/3,0) satisfy both? Yes. But is it a vertex?\\n\\nActually, the binding constraints:\\n\\nThe feasible region is bounded by:\\n- Origin (0,0)\\n- Intersection with axes and the two lines\\n\\nLet’s list all corner points of the region R:\\n\\n1. (0,0): satisfies both inequalities\\n2. Where 3x+2y=1 meets x-axis: (1/3, 0). Check x+4y = 1/3 ≤ 1 → valid\\n3. Where the two lines meet: (1/5, 1/5)\\n4. Where x+4y=1 meets y-axis: (0, 1/4). Check 3(0)+2(1/4)=0.5 ≤ 1 → valid\\nBut wait: is (0,1/4) under the first constraint? Yes: 2*(1/4)=0.5 ≤ 1\\nIs (0,1/2) in? No, because x+4y = 0 + 4*(1/2)=2 > 1 → violates second\\n\\nNow, which points form the polygon?\\n\\nWe need the intersection of the two half-planes within the unit square.\\n\\nLet’s plot the feasible region:\\n\\n- Start at (0,0)\\n- Move along x-axis to where? The first constraint cuts x-axis at (1/3,0), second at (1,0). So tighter is (1/3,0). But is (1/3,0) in the region? Yes.\\nBut does the boundary go from (0,0) to (1/3,0)? Only if no other constraint cuts earlier.\\nBut actually, the region is a polygon with vertices:\\n\\nCheck feasibility:\\nAt (0,0): ok\\nFollow boundary of 3x+2y=1 from (1/3,0) up to (1/5,1/5), then from there along x+4y=1 to (0,1/4), then back to (0,0)?\\nWait: from (0,1/4) to (0,0) is along y-axis.\\nBut is the region convex? Yes, intersection of half-planes.\\n\\nSo the region R is a quadrilateral with vertices:\\n\\nA: (0,0)\\nB: (1/3, 0)\\nC: (1/5, 1/5)\\nD: (0, 1/4)\\n\\nWait — but from (1/3,0) to (1/5,1/5) is along 3x+2y=1?\\nCheck: at (1/3,0): 3*(1/3)+0=1 → yes\\nat (1/5,1/5): 3/5 + 2/5 = 1 → yes\\n\\nFrom (1/5,1/5) to (0,1/4): along x+4y=1?\\nAt (1/5,1/5): 1/5 + 4/5 = 1 → yes\\nAt (0,1/4): 0 + 1 = 1 → yes\\n\\nFrom (0,1/4) to (0,0): along x=0\\nFrom (0,0) to (1/3,0): along y=0\\n\\nBut is the entire segment from (0,0) to (1/3,0) in the region?\\nTake (x,0), 0≤x≤1/3: 3x ≤1 → ok, x ≤1 → ok → yes\\nSimilarly, (0,y), 0≤y≤1/4: 2y ≤ 2*(1/4)=0.5≤1 → ok, 4y≤1 → ok → yes\\n\\nBut what about between (1/3,0) and (1/5,1/5)? That’s on 3x+2y=1, and we need to ensure x+4y≤1.\\nAt (1/5,1/5): equality\\nAt (1/3,0): x+4y=1/3<1 → satisfied\\nAnd since the function x+4y increases as we move up, but we are moving from (1/3,0) to (1/5,1/5), let's see:\\nx decreases, y increases.\\nd(x+4y) = dx + 4dy\\nAlong the line 3x+2y=1, differentiate: 3dx + 2dy = 0 → dy = -3/2 dx\\nSo d(x+4y) = dx + 4*(-3/2 dx) = dx -6dx = -5dx\\nAs we move from (1/3,0) to (1/5,1/5), x decreases → dx < 0 → -5dx > 0 → so x+4y increases\\nAt start: x+4y = 1/3 ≈ 0.333\\nAt end: 1/5 + 4/5 = 1\\nSo it goes from 1/3 to 1, always ≤1 → so entire segment satisfies second inequality.\\n\\nSimilarly, on the segment from (1/5,1/5) to (0,1/4), along x+4y=1, check 3x+2y≤1:\\nAt (1/5,1/5): 3/5+2/5=1 → equal\\nAt (0,1/4): 0 + 2*(1/4)=0.5 ≤1 → ok\\nParametrize: from (1/5,1/5) to (0,1/4)\\nLet t from 0 to 1: x = (1-t)/5, y = (1-t)/5 + t*(1/4 - 1/5) = (1-t)/5 + t*(1/20) = (4(1-t) + t)/20 = (4 - 3t)/20\\nBetter: vector: Δx = -1/5, Δy = 1/4 - 1/5 = 1/20\\nSo x = 1/5 - t/5, y = 1/5 + t/20, t∈[0,1]\\nThen 3x+2y = 3(1/5 - t/5) + 2(1/5 + t/20) = 3/5 - 3t/5 + 2/5 + t/10 = (3/5+2/5) + (-3t/5 + t/10) = 1 + (-6t/10 + t/10) = 1 - (5t)/10 = 1 - t/2 ≤ 1 → always true\\nAnd decreasing → so 3x+2y ≤1 holds\\n\\nThus, the region R is a quadrilateral with vertices:\\n\\nP1 = (0,0)\\nP2 = (1/3, 0)\\nP3 = (1/5, 1/5)\\nP4 = (0, 1/4)\\n\\nWait — but (0,1/4) is not directly connected to (0,0) in the boundary? Actually, from P4=(0,1/4) to P1=(0,0) is along x=0, and from P1 to P2 along y=0.\\nBut is the region convex hull of these four points? Let's list them in order.\\n\\nActually, better to list in cyclic order:\\nStart at (0,0), go to (1/3,0), then to (1/5,1/5), then to (0,1/4), then back to (0,0).\\nYes.\\n\\nNow compute the area of this quadrilateral.\\n\\nWe can use the shoelace formula.\\n\\nList the vertices in counterclockwise order:\\n\\n1. (0,0)\\n2. (1/3, 0)\\n3. (1/5, 1/5)\\n4. (0, 1/4)\\nBack to (0,0)\\n\\nShoelace:\\n\\nArea = 1/2 |sum|\\n\\nCompute:\\n\\nx     y\\n0     0\\n1/3   0\\n1/5   1/5\\n0     1/4\\n0     0  ← back\\n\\nSum1 = sum of x_i y_{i+1}:\\n0*0 + (1/3)*(1/5) + (1/5)*(1/4) + 0*0 = 0 + 1/15 + 1/20 + 0 = (4 + 3)/60 = 7/60\\n\\nSum2 = sum of y_i x_{i+1}:\\n0*(1/3) + 0*(1/5) + (1/5)*0 + (1/4)*0 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\\n\\nWait, that can't be right. Shoelace is:\\n\\nArea = 1/2 |∑_{i=1}^n (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|\\n\\nSo better to compute each term: (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)\\n\\ni=1: x1=0,y1=0; x2=1/3,y2=0\\n→ (0*0 - (1/3)*0) = 0 - 0 = 0\\n\\ni=2: x2=1/3,y2=0; x3=1/5,y3=1/5\\n→ (1/3)*(1/5) - (1/5)*0 = 1/15 - 0 = 1/15\\n\\ni=3: x3=1/5,y3=1/5; x4=0,y4=1/4\\n→ (1/5)*(1/4) - 0*(1/5) = 1/20 - 0 = 1/20\\n\\ni=4: x4=0,y4=1/4; x1=0,y1=0\\n→ 0*0 - 0*(1/4) = 0 - 0 = 0\\n\\nSum = 0 + 1/15 + 1/20 + 0 = (4 + 3)/60 = 7/60\\n\\nArea = 1/2 * |7/60| = 7/120\\n\\nBut wait, that seems too small. Is this correct?\\n\\nPlotting: from (0,0) to (1/3≈0.333,0) to (0.2,0.2) to (0,0.25) back to (0,0).\\nThe shape is a quadrilateral. But notice that (0.2,0.2) is above the line from (1/3,0) to (0,0.25)?\\n\\nAlternatively, we can split into two parts:\\n\\n- Triangle from (0,0), (1/3,0), (1/5,1/5)\\n- Triangle from (0,0), (1/5,1/5), (0,1/4)\\n\\nBut (0,0) is shared, but the region is not star-shaped that way.\\nBetter to split along x=0 or y=0.\\n\\nSplit the quadrilateral into two parts:\\n1. Triangle A: (0,0), (1/3,0), (1/5,1/5)\\n2. Triangle B: (0,0), (1/5,1/5), (0,1/4)\\n\\nBut do these cover the region without overlap? The quadrilateral is (0,0)-(1/3,0)-(1/5,1/5)-(0,1/4)-(0,0). So if we take triangle A and triangle C: (0,0),(1/5,1/5),(0,1/4), then together they make the quadrilateral, since the diagonal is from (0,0) to (1/5,1/5)? But actually, the region includes points not on that diagonal.\\n\\nActually, the quadrilateral is convex, and we can use shoelace, but I think I made a mistake in the order.\\n\\nAre the points in counterclockwise order?\\n(0,0) → (1/3,0) → (1/5,1/5) → (0,1/4) → (0,0)\\nFrom (1/3,0) to (1/5,1/5): left and up\\nThen to (0,1/4): left and up a bit\\nThen down to (0,0)\\nBut (0,1/4)=(0,0.25), (1/5,1/5)=(0.2,0.2), so from (0.2,0.2) to (0,0.25): left and up\\nThen from (0,0.25) to (0,0): straight down\\nFrom (0,0) to (1/3,0): right\\nSo the path is: right, then up-left to (0.2,0.2), then left-up to (0,0.25), then down to origin.\\nThis might be clockwise?\\nLet me sketch:\\nStart at origin, go east to (1/3,0), then northwest to (0.2,0.2), then west-northwest to (0,0.25), then south to (0,0). This encloses a region, but is it clockwise?\\nFrom (0,0) to (1/3,0): east\\nTo (0.2,0.2): west and north — so turning left? From east to northwest — that's a left turn, so counterclockwise.\\nThen from (0.2,0.2) to (0,0.25): west and north — direction is about 180 - arctan(0.05/0.2)=arctan(1/4)≈14 degrees north of west, while previous vector was from (1/3,0)≈(0.333,0) to (0.2,0.2): delta=(-0.133,0.2), so direction about arctan(0.2/-0.133)≈ arctan(-1.5) in second quadrant ≈ 123 degrees from positive x-axis.\\nCurrent vector: (-0.2,0.05), arctan(0.05/-0.2)=arctan(-0.25) in second quadrant ≈ 166 degrees.\\nSo turning from 123° to 166°, which is a left turn, so still counterclockwise.\\nThen to (0,0): (0,-0.25), direction 270° or -90°, from 166° to 270° is a right turn? 270 - 166 = 104°, but shortest way is clockwise? Angles increase counterclockwise.\\nFrom direction 166° to 270°, difference 104°, which is less than 180, so if we turn 104° left, it's counterclockwise.\\nThen from (0,0) back to start, but we're closing.\\nSo overall counterclockwise — good.\\n\\nBut in shoelace, I got sum of (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) = 7/60, then area = 1/2 * 7/60 = 7/120 ≈ 0.0583\\n\\nBut let's verify by geometry.\\n\\nAlternative: integrate.\\n\\nFor fixed x, what y satisfies:\\n\\n3x + 2y ≤ 1  => y ≤ (1-3x)/2\\nx + 4y ≤ 1   => y ≤ (1-x)/4\\nand y ≥ 0\\nAlso x ≥ 0\\n\\nAlso, for y to be real, need 1-3x ≥0 => x ≤ 1/3\\nAnd 1-x ≥0 => x ≤1, but tighter is x≤1/3\\nAlso, when x≥0\\n\\nNow, compare (1-3x)/2 and (1-x)/4\\nSet equal: (1-3x)/2 = (1-x)/4\\nMultiply both sides by 4: 2(1-3x) = 1-x → 2 - 6x = 1 - x → 2-1 = 6x - x → 1=5x → x=1/5\\n\\nFor x < 1/5, which is smaller?\\nAt x=0: (1-0)/2=0.5, (1-0)/4=0.25 → so (1-x)/4 < (1-3x)/2\\nSo the tighter constraint is y ≤ (1-x)/4\\n\\nFor x > 1/5, say x=0.3: (1-0.9)/2=0.1/2=0.05, (1-0.3)/4=0.7/4=0.175 → so (1-3x)/2 < (1-x)/4\\n\\nThus:\\n- For 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/5, y ≤ min = (1-x)/4\\n- For 1/5 ≤ x ≤ 1/3, y ≤ min = (1-3x)/2\\n\\nAlso y ≥ 0\\n\\nSo area = ∫_{x=0}^{1/5} [(1-x)/4] dx + ∫_{x=1/5}^{1/3} [(1-3x)/2] dx\\n\\nCompute first integral:\\n∫_0^{0.2} (1-x)/4 dx = (1/4) ∫_0^{0.2} (1-x) dx = (1/4) [x - x^2/2]_0^{0.2} = (1/4)[0.2 - (0.04)/2] = (1/4)[0.2 - 0.02] = (1/4)(0.18) = 0.045\\nIn fractions:\\nx from 0 to 1/5\\n[x - x^2/2] from 0 to 1/5 = (1/5) - (1/25)/2 = 1/5 - 1/50 = 10/50 - 1/50 = 9/50\\nThen times 1/4: (1/4)*(9/50) = 9/200\\n\\nSecond integral:\\n∫_{1/5}^{1/3} (1-3x)/2 dx = (1/2) ∫_{1/5}^{1/3} (1-3x) dx = (1/2) [x - (3/2)x^2]_{1/5}^{1/3}\\nAntiderivative: x - (3/2)x^2\\nAt x=1/3: (1/3) - (3/2)(1/9) = 1/3 - 3/18 = 1/3 - 1/6 = 1/6\\nAt x=1/5: (1/5) - (3/2)(1/25) = 1/5 - 3/50 = 10/50 - 3/50 = 7/50\\nSo difference: 1/6 - 7/50 = (25 - 21)/150 = 4/150 = 2/75\\nThen times 1/2: (1/2)*(2/75) = 1/75\\n\\nNow total area = 9/200 + 1/75\\nFind common denominator: 200 and 75, LCM of 200 and 75.\\n200=8*25, 75=3*25, so LCM=8*3*25=600\\n9/200 = (9*3)/(600) = 27/600\\n1/75 = 8/600? 75*8=600, so 1/75=8/600? No: 1/75 = 8/600? 600/75=8, so 1/75=8/600? No: 1/75 = ? /600 → ? = 600/75 = 8, so yes, 1/75 = 8/600\\nBut 8/600 = 1/75? 8÷8 / 600÷8 = 1/75, yes.\\nSo 9/200 = ? 200 * 3 = 600, so 9*3=27, so 27/600\\nThus total = 27/600 + 8/600 = 35/600 = 7/120\\nSame as shoelace.\\nSo area(R) = 7/120\\n\\nNow, the problem says: instead of computing the probability, find k = area(R) + 1553/120\\nSo k = 7/120 + 1553/120 = (7 + 1553)/120 = 1560/120 = 13\\nBecause 1560 ÷ 120 = 13 (since 120*13=1560)\\nSo k = 13\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nIn bridge, a hand has 13 cards.\\nWe are told that a particular hand has exactly 4 cards that are A, K, Q, or J. These are the face cards, 4 of each, total 16 such cards in deck.\\nWe need the probability that the point value is at least 13, given that there are exactly 4 honor cards (A,K,Q,J) in the hand.\\nPoints: A=4, K=3, Q=2, J=1\\nLet the number of A,K,Q,J in the hand be a,k,q,j respectively.\\nGiven: a+k+q+j = 4\\nPoint total: p = 4a + 3k + 2q + j\\nWe want P(p ≥ 13 | a+k+q+j=4)\\nSince the hand is dealt randomly, and we condition on exactly 4 honor cards, we can think of the conditional distribution.\\nThe non-honor cards (10 through 2) are 52 - 16 = 36 cards, and we have 13 - 4 = 9 non-honor cards in the hand.\\nBut since the conditioning is only on the number of honor cards, and the point value depends only on which honor cards are selected, not on the others, we can focus on the hypergeometric selection of the honor cards.\\nSpecifically, given that the hand contains exactly 4 honor cards, the types of these 4 cards are equally likely among all ways to choose 4 cards from the 16 honor cards.\\nIs that correct?\\nTotal ways to have a hand with exactly 4 honor cards:\\n- Choose 4 honor cards from 16\\n- Choose 9 non-honor cards from 36\\nTotal such hands: C(16,4) * C(36,9)\\nFor a specific combination of honor cards (a,k,q,j) with a+k+q+j=4, the number of ways to choose them:\\nNumber of ways: C(4,a) * C(4,k) * C(4,q) * C(4,j)  [since 4 Aces, etc.]\\nThen multiplied by C(36,9) for the rest.\\nTherefore, the conditional probability given exactly 4 honor cards is proportional to the number of ways to choose the honor cards, i.e., the multinomial coefficient.\\nSpecifically, P(a,k,q,j | sum=4) = [C(4,a)C(4,k)C(4,q)C(4,j)] / C(16,4)\\nSince the C(36,9) cancels out in numerator and denominator.\\nSo we need to find the sum over all non-negative integers a,k,q,j such that a+k+q+j=4 and 4a+3k+2q+j ≥ 13 of C(4,a)C(4,k)C(4,q)C(4,j), divided by C(16,4)\\nFirst, compute total number of ways to choose 4 honor cards from 16: C(16,4) = 1820\\nNow, list all possible (a,k,q,j) with a+k+q+j=4, and compute the point value and the number of combinations.\\nWe can iterate over possible a from 0 to 4, then k from 0 to 4-a, etc.\\nBut since 4a+3k+2q+j ≥13, and maximum possible is when a=4: 16, minimum 0.\\nNote that j = 4 - a - k - q, so p = 4a + 3k + 2q + (4 - a - k - q) = 3a + 2k + q + 4\\np = 4a + 3k + 2q + j, and j=4-a-k-q, so\\np = 4a + 3k + 2q + (4 - a - k - q) = (4a - a) + (3k - k) + (2q - q) + 4 = 3a + 2k + q + 4\\nWe want p ≥ 13, so 3a + 2k + q + 4 ≥ 13 → 3a + 2k + q ≥ 9\\nNow a,k,q ≥0 integers, a+k+q ≤4 (since j=4-a-k-q≥0)\\nWe need 3a + 2k + q ≥9\\nMax of 3a+2k+q: when a=4, but a≤4, if a=4, k=q=0, then 12 +0+0=12≥9\\na=3: 3*3=9, so even if k=q=0, 9≥9\\na=2: 3*2=6, so need 2k+q≥3\\na=1: 3*1=3, need 2k+q≥6\\na=0: need 2k+q≥9, but k≤4, q≤4, max 2*4+4=12, but k+q≤4, so max 2k+q when k=4,q=0: 8, or k=3,q=1:6+1=7, k=4,q=0:8<9, so impossible for a=0\\nSimilarly, a=1: max 2k+q with k+q≤3 (since a=1, k+q≤3), max when k=3,q=0:6, or k=2,q=1:4+1=5, k=3,q=0:6<6? 6≥6, so possible\\n2k+q≥6, with k+q≤3\\nPossible: k=3,q=0: 6≥6, j=4-1-3-0=0\\nk=2,q=2: but k+q=4>3? a=1, so k+q≤3, so q≤1 if k=2? k+q≤3\\nk=3,q=0: 2*3+0=6≥6\\nk=2,q=1: 4+1=5<6, no\\nk=1,q=2:2+2=4<6,no\\nk=0,q=3:0+3=3<6,no\\nSo only (a,k,q)=(1,3,0)\\nBut j=4-1-3-0=0\\nNow a=2: 3a=6, need 2k+q≥3, with k+q≤2 (since a=2)\\nk+q≤2\\nPossible:\\nk=2,q=0: 4+0=4≥3 → yes\\nk=2,q=1: but k+q=3>2? no, k+q≤2\\nk=1,q=1:2+1=3≥3 → yes\\nk=1,q=0:2+0=2<3 → no\\nk=0,q=2:0+2=2<3 → no\\nk=0,q=1:1<3,no\\nk=0,q=0:0<3,no\\nk=2,q=0:4≥3, and k+q=2≤2, j=4-2-2-0=0\\nk=1,q=1:2+1=3≥3, j=4-2-1-1=0\\nk=2,q=0 and k=1,q=1\\nk=0,q=2: but 0+2=2<3, no\\nSo (2,2,0) and (2,1,1)\\na=3: 3a=9, need 2k+q≥0, always true, and k+q≤1\\nSo possibilities:\\nk=0,q=0: j=1\\nk=0,q=1: j=0\\nk=1,q=0: j=0\\nk=1,q=1: k+q=2>1? no, since a=3, k+q≤1\\nSo (3,0,0), (3,0,1), (3,1,0)\\na=4: a=4, k=q=j=0, 3a+2k+q=12≥9, yes\\nNow list all cases where 3a+2k+q≥9:\\n1. a=4,k=0,q=0,j=0\\n2. a=3,k=0,q=0,j=1\\n3. a=3,k=0,q=1,j=0\\n4. a=3,k=1,q=0,j=0\\n5. a=2,k=2,q=0,j=0\\n6. a=2,k=1,q=1,j=0\\n7. a=1,k=3,q=0,j=0\\nNow compute the number of combinations for each:\\nRecall: num = C(4,a) * C(4,k) * C(4,q) * C(4,j)\\n1. a=4,k=0,q=0,j=0: C(4,4)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)*C(4,0) = 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 1\\n2. a=3,k=0,q=0,j=1: C(4,3)*C(4,0)*C(4,0)*C(4,1) = 4 * 1 * 1 * 4 = 16\\n3. a=3,k=0,q=1,j=0: C(4,3)*C(4,0)*C(4,1)*C(4,0) = 4 * 1 * 4 * 1 = 16\\n4. a=3,k=1,q=0,j=0: C(4,3)*C(4,1)*C(4,0)*C(4,0) = 4 * 4 * 1 * 1 = 16\\n5. a=2,k=2,q=0,j=0: C(4,2)*C(4,2)*C(4,0)*C(4,0) = 6 * 6 * 1 * 1 = 36\\n6. a=2,k=1,q=1,j=0: C(4,2)*C(4,1)*C(4,1)*C(4,0) = 6 * 4 * 4 * 1 = 96\\n7. a=1,k=3,q=0,j=0: C(4,1)*C(4,3)*C(4,0)*C(4,0) = 4 * 4 * 1 * 1 = 16\\nNow sum these: 1 + 16 =17; +16=33; +16=49; +36=85; +96=181; +16=197\\nSo total favorable = 197\\nTotal possible = C(16,4) = 1820? Earlier I said C(16,4), but is that correct?\\nC(16,4) = 16!/(4!12!) = (16×15×14×13)/(4×3×2×1) = (16×15×14×13)/24\\n16×15=240, 240×14=3360, 3360×13=43680, divided by 24: 43680 / 24 = 1820, yes.\\nSo probability = 197 / 1820\\nBut is this reduced? Check gcd.\\n197 is prime? 197, divisible by primes less than sqrt(197)≈14: 2,3,5,7,11,13. 197 odd, not div by 2; 1+9+7=17 not div by 3; ends with 7 not 0 or 5; 7*28=196, 197-196=1, not div; 11*17=187, 197-187=10, not div; 13*15=195, 197-195=2, not div. So 197 prime.\\n1820 div by 197? 197*9=1773, 1820-1773=47, not zero. So gcd=1. So fraction is 197/1820.\\nBut the problem asks for the probability, so answer should be 197/1820.\\nBut let me double-check if I missed any case.\\nEarlier for a=1, only (1,3,0)\\nWhat about (1,2,2)? a=1,k=2,q=2, then j=4-1-2-2=-1? impossible\\nOr (1,4,0) but k≤4, but a+k+q+j=1+4+0+j=5+j≥5>4, impossible\\na=0: we said impossible, but check: need 2k+q≥9, k+q≤4\\nMax 2k+q: k=4,q=0:8<9; k=3,q=1:6+1=7<9; k=4,q=1: but k+q=5>4? no, k+q≤4\\nk=4,q=0:8<9; k=3,q=1:7<9; k=2,q=2:4+2=6<9; etc. max is 8, so indeed impossible.\\na=2: we have (2,2,0) and (2,1,1)\\nIs (2,0,3)? q=3, but k+q≤2? a=2, so k+q≤2, q≤2, so q=3 impossible\\n(2,3,0)? k=3, k+q≤2? 3>2, no\\na=3: we have three: (3,0,0),(3,0,1),(3,1,0)\\n(3,1,1)? k+q=2>1? a=3, k+q≤1, so no\\na=4: only (4,0,0,0)\\nNow, what about (0,4,1)? but a=0, and 2k+q=8+1=9≥9, but a+k+q+j=0+4+1+j=5+j≥5>4, unless j=-1, impossible\\nSimilarly, (1,4,0): 1+4+0+j=5+j>4\\nOr (2,3,0): 2+3+0+j=5+j>4\\nAll exceed sum.\\nAnother possibility: (0,3,3): k=3,q=3,j=?, sum a+k+q=0+3+3=6>4, no\\nOr (1,2,3):1+2+3=6>4\\nSo only the seven cases.\\nNow sum: 1+16+16+16+36+96+16\\n1+16=17\\n17+16=33\\n33+16=49\\n49+36=85\\n85+96=181\\n181+16=197, yes.\\nTotal C(16,4)=1820\\nSo probability is 197/1820\\nBut the problem says \\\"find the probability\\\", so this should be the answer.\\nHowever, let me confirm with another approach.\\nMaximum point is 16 (four aces), minimum 0.\\nWe want p≥13.\\nSince p=3a+2k+q+4, and a+k+q+j=4, j≥0.\\nWe can list all partitions.\\nBut I think it's correct.\\nNote that for p≥13, since max is 16, and 13,14,15,16.\\nBut perhaps compute complementary, but probably not necessary.\\nI think 197/1820 is correct.\\nSo answer for problem 2 is 197/1820.\\nBut the problem says \\\"compute\\\" but doesn't specify format, but since it's probability, fraction is fine.\\nNow back to problem 1, we have k=13.\\nSo final answers.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"13\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"197/1820\"\n}",
