  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\n\\nWe are given a tetrahedron ABCD with volume 1, inscribed in a circumsphere ω. We know:\\n\\n- AB = AC = AD = 2 (so A is equidistant from B, C, D)\\n- Volume of tetrahedron ABCD is 1\\n- BC ⋅ CD ⋅ DB = 16\\n- We are to find δ = AX − 7/10, where AX is the altitude from A to the plane of triangle BCD.\\n\\nSince AB = AC = AD = 2, point A lies at equal distance from B, C, D, so it lies on the perpendicular line from the circumcenter of triangle BCD. But more importantly, since all edges from A are equal, the foot X of the perpendicular from A to plane BCD is the center of the circle passing through B, C, D — but not necessarily the circumcenter unless triangle BCD is equilateral. However, because A is equidistant to B, C, D, the foot X must be the circumcenter of triangle BCD. This is a key geometric fact: if a point A is equidistant from three non-collinear points B, C, D, then its projection onto the plane of BCD is the circumcenter of triangle BCD.\\n\\nLet R be the circumradius of triangle BCD. Then XB = XC = XD = R.\\n\\nSince AB = 2, and AX is the height h from A to plane BCD, by Pythagoras:\\n\\nAB² = AX² + XB² ⇒ 2² = h² + R² ⇒ 4 = h² + R² → (1)\\n\\nVolume of tetrahedron is:\\n\\nV = (1/3) × base area × height = (1/3) × [Area of △BCD] × h = 1\\n\\nSo:\\n[Area of △BCD] = 3/h → (2)\\n\\nWe also know that for any triangle with side lengths a = BC, b = CD, c = DB, the area can be expressed via the circumradius R as:\\n\\nArea = (abc)/(4R)\\n\\nGiven that BC ⋅ CD ⋅ DB = 16, so abc = 16.\\n\\nThus:\\n\\nArea = 16/(4R) = 4/R → (3)\\n\\nNow equate (2) and (3):\\n\\n3/h = 4/R ⇒ 3R = 4h ⇒ R = (4h)/3\\n\\nNow plug into equation (1):\\n\\n4 = h² + R² = h² + (16h²)/9 = (9h² + 16h²)/9 = (25h²)/9\\n\\nSo:\\n4 = (25h²)/9 → h² = (4×9)/25 = 36/25 → h = 6/5 = 1.2\\n\\nTherefore, AX = h = 6/5 = 1.2\\n\\nNow compute δ = AX − 7/10 = 6/5 − 7/10 = 12/10 − 7/10 = 5/10 = 1/2\\n\\nSo δ = 0.5\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 1: 1/2\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nWe are given points A = (0,0), B = (200,100), C = (30,330). We are to count the number of ordered pairs (x,y) of integers such that the point (x+½, y+½) lies strictly inside triangle ABC.\\n\\nNote: The point (x+½, y+½) is the center of the unit square with lower-left corner (x,y). So we are counting the number of unit squares whose centers lie inside triangle ABC, i.e., the number of lattice squares entirely or partially covering the interior such that their center is inside.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of lattice points (x,y) such that (x+½, y+½) ∈ int(△ABC).\\n\\nLet P = (x+½, y+½). We want P strictly inside △ABC.\\n\\nThis is a classic application of **Pick’s Theorem**, but slightly modified. Alternatively, we can use coordinate geometry and transform the problem.\\n\\nLet u = x + ½, v = y + ½. Then (u,v) must be strictly inside triangle ABC, and (u,v) runs over all half-integers shifted by ½, i.e., u, v ∈ ℤ + ½.\\n\\nBut instead of working with half-integers, define new variables: let x' = 2u = 2x+1, y' = 2v = 2y+1. Then (x', y') are odd integers, and (u,v) = (x'/2, y'/2).\\n\\nThen (u,v) ∈ int(△ABC) iff (x'/2, y'/2) is inside △ABC.\\n\\nSo the number of such (x,y) is equal to the number of points (X,Y) with X,Y odd integers such that (X/2, Y/2) is in the interior of △ABC.\\n\\nAlternatively, scale the entire figure by 2: define a linear transformation that maps (x+½, y+½) → (2x+1, 2y+1). Then the triangle ABC becomes a triangle A'B'C' with vertices:\\n\\nA = (0,0) → (0,0) under scaling? Wait — better idea:\\n\\nInstead, consider that we are counting integer lattice points (x,y) such that (x+½, y+½) is in the interior of △ABC.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of unit squares (with integer corners) whose center lies inside △ABC.\\n\\nThere is a known technique: use the formula involving the area and boundary points, but adjusted for center-inclusion.\\n\\nAlternatively, use the following idea: the number of such (x,y) is equal to the number of integer points (x,y) such that (x+½, y+½) satisfies the inequalities defining the interior of triangle ABC.\\n\\nWe can use the concept of **lattice point enumeration** via Pick's Theorem, but reversed.\\n\\nBut here’s a better method: use the fact that the number of points (x+½, y+½) inside a polygon with vertices on lattice points can be computed by transforming the problem.\\n\\nLet T be triangle ABC. Let N be the number of half-integer points (i.e., points with coordinates in ℤ + ½) in the interior of T.\\n\\nEach such point is of the form (x+½, y+½) for integers x,y, so N is exactly what we want.\\n\\nTo compute the number of half-integer interior points of a polygon, we can use a scaled version.\\n\\nScale the entire plane by a factor of 2: define a map (x,y) ↦ (2x,2y). Then:\\n\\n- Triangle ABC becomes triangle A'B'C' with:\\n  A' = (0,0), B' = (400,200), C' = (60,660)\\n- The half-integer points in the original plane become integer points in the scaled plane.\\n- Interior half-integer points in △ABC correspond to interior integer points in △A'B'C'.\\n\\nTherefore, the number we seek is equal to the number of interior lattice points in triangle A'B'C' with vertices:\\nA' = (0,0), B' = (400,200), C' = (60,660)\\n\\nBy Pick’s Theorem:\\n\\nArea = I + B/2 − 1, where I = interior lattice points, B = boundary lattice points.\\n\\nSo we need to compute:\\nI = Area − B/2 + 1\\n\\nFirst, compute area of △A'B'C'. Use shoelace formula:\\n\\nArea = (1/2)| x1(y2−y3) + x2(y3−y1) + x3(y1−y2) |\\n= (1/2)| 0*(200−660) + 400*(660−0) + 60*(0−200) |\\n= (1/2)| 0 + 400×660 − 60×200 |\\n= (1/2)| 264000 − 12000 | = (1/2)(252000) = 126000\\n\\nSo Area = 126000\\n\\nNow compute B = number of lattice points on the boundary of triangle A'B'C'.\\n\\nB = number on A'B' + number on B'C' + number on C'A' − 3 (because vertices counted twice)\\n\\nNumber of lattice points on a segment from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) is gcd(|Δx|, |Δy|) + 1\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nSegment A'B': from (0,0) to (400,200)\\nΔx = 400, Δy = 200, gcd(400,200) = 200\\n→ number of points = 200 + 1 = 201\\n\\nSegment B'C': from (400,200) to (60,660)\\nΔx = 60−400 = −340, Δy = 660−200 = 460\\ngcd(340,460): compute gcd(340,460)\\n460 = 1×340 + 120\\n340 = 2×120 + 100\\n120 = 1×100 + 20\\n100 = 5×20 + 0 → gcd = 20\\nSo number of points = 20 + 1 = 21\\n\\nSegment C'A': from (60,660) to (0,0)\\nΔx = −60, Δy = −660, gcd(60,660) = 60? 660 ÷ 60 = 11 → yes, gcd = 60\\nSo number of points = 60 + 1 = 61\\n\\nTotal boundary points B = 201 + 21 + 61 − 3 = 280 (subtract 3 for the three vertices counted twice)\\n\\nNow apply Pick’s Theorem:\\n\\nArea = I + B/2 − 1\\n126000 = I + 280/2 − 1 = I + 140 − 1 = I + 139\\n⇒ I = 126000 − 139 = 125861\\n\\nTherefore, the number of interior lattice points in the scaled triangle is 125861, which equals the number of half-integer interior points in the original triangle.\\n\\nHence, the number of integer pairs (x,y) such that (x+½, y+½) is in the interior of triangle ABC is 125861.\\n\\nAnswer to Problem 2: 125861\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"125861\"\n}",
