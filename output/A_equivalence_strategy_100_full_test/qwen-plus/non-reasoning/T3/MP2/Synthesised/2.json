But instead of finding $ n $, we are told to compute $ \\\\ell = m - 95 $, so $ m = \\\\ell + 95 $.\\n\\nThen we are to consider a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with side lengths:\\n- $ AB = \\\\ell $\\n- $ BC = 3 $\\n- $ CD = 5 $\\n- $ DA = 4 $\\n\\nand find the **maximum possible radius** of a circle inscribed in this quadrilateral.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Work with the system of congruences\\n\\nLet’s treat the two congruences modulo $ m $:\\n\\n(1) $ 3a + 5b \\\\equiv 19 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\n(2) $ 4a + 2b \\\\equiv 25 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nWe want to find $ 2a + 6b \\\\mod m $, but ultimately we are not solving for $ a $ and $ b $, but rather trying to determine $ m $ such that integer solutions $ a, b $ exist.\\n\\nBut note: $ n $ is defined as the answer to the problem, and $ m = n+1 $. So $ m = (answer) + 1 $, and $ \\\\ell = m - 95 $. This suggests a circular definition unless we can find constraints on $ m $ from the system.\\n\\nBut perhaps the key is that $ a $ and $ b $ are positive integers, and the congruences must be simultaneously solvable modulo $ m $. The existence of solutions depends on whether the system is consistent modulo $ m $.\\n\\nLet’s try to eliminate variables.\\n\\nMultiply equation (1) by 4:  \\n$ 12a + 20b \\\\equiv 76 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nMultiply equation (2) by 3:  \\n$ 12a + 6b \\\\equiv 75 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nSubtract:\\n\\n$ (12a + 20b) - (12a + 6b) \\\\equiv 76 - 75 \\\\pmod{m} $  \\n$ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\n\\nThis means that $ 14b - 1 $ is divisible by $ m $, i.e., $ m \\\\mid (14b - 1) $.\\n\\nSimilarly, we can solve for $ a $.\\n\\nFrom equation (2): $ 4a + 2b \\\\equiv 25 \\\\Rightarrow 2a + b \\\\equiv 12.5 $? No, better to keep integer coefficients.\\n\\nFrom $ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $, this implies that $ 14 $ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $ m $, so $ \\\\gcd(14, m) = 1 $. Thus $ m $ must be coprime to 14 → $ m $ odd and not divisible by 7.\\n\\nAlso, since $ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $, then $ b \\\\equiv 14^{-1} \\\\pmod{m} $, so $ b $ exists mod $ m $.\\n\\nNow let’s go back and eliminate $ b $.\\n\\nFrom (1): $ 3a + 5b \\\\equiv 19 $\\n\\nFrom (2): $ 4a + 2b \\\\equiv 25 $\\n\\nMultiply (1) by 2: $ 6a + 10b \\\\equiv 38 $\\n\\nMultiply (2) by 5: $ 20a + 10b \\\\equiv 125 $\\n\\nSubtract:\\n\\n$ (20a + 10b) - (6a + 10b) = 14a \\\\equiv 125 - 38 = 87 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\n\\nEarlier we had:\\n\\n$$\\n14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\n\\nSo now we have:\\n\\n- $ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n- $ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nMultiply second equation by 6: $ 84b \\\\equiv 6 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nWe are to find $ 2a + 6b $. Let's compute $ 2a + 6b \\\\mod m $.\\n\\nFrom above:\\n\\n$ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\Rightarrow 2a \\\\equiv \\\\frac{87}{7} \\\\mod m $? Not helpful.\\n\\nInstead, let’s compute $ 2a + 6b $ using linear combination.\\n\\nLet’s express $ 2a + 6b $ in terms of the original equations.\\n\\nLet:\\n\\n$ x = 3a + 5b \\\\equiv 19 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\n$ y = 4a + 2b \\\\equiv 25 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nWe want $ 2a + 6b $.\\n\\nSuppose:\\n\\n$ 2a + 6b = p(3a + 5b) + q(4a + 2b) $\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$ 2a + 6b = (3p + 4q)a + (5p + 2q)b $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$ 3p + 4q = 2 $  \\n$ 5p + 2q = 6 $\\n\\nSolve:\\n\\nFrom first: $ 3p + 4q = 2 $\\nSecond: $ 5p + 2q = 6 $\\n\\nMultiply second by 2: $ 10p + 4q = 12 $\\n\\nSubtract first: $ (10p + 4q) - (3p + 4q) = 12 - 2 \\\\Rightarrow 7p = 10 \\\\Rightarrow p = 10/7 $, not integer.\\n\\nTry elimination:\\n\\nFrom earlier:\\n\\nWe have:\\n\\n$ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m} $  \\n$ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nMultiply first by 1, second by 6:\\n\\n$ 14a \\\\equiv 87 $  \\n$ 84b \\\\equiv 6 $\\n\\nAdd: $ 14a + 84b \\\\equiv 93 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nDivide both sides by 7: $ 2a + 12b \\\\equiv 93/7 $? Not valid unless 7 divides 93.\\n\\nNote: $ 2a + 6b = \\\\frac{1}{7}(14a + 42b) $\\n\\nBut $ 14a \\\\equiv 87 $, $ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\Rightarrow 42b \\\\equiv 3 $, so:\\n\\n$ 14a + 42b \\\\equiv 87 + 3 = 90 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$ 7(2a + 6b) = 14a + 42b \\\\equiv 90 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n7(2a + 6b) \\\\equiv 90 \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\n\\nThus:\\n\\n$$\\n2a + 6b \\\\equiv 90 \\\\cdot 7^{-1} \\\\pmod{m}\\n$$\\n\\nBut we don't know $ 7^{-1} $ mod $ m $, unless $ \\\\gcd(7, m) = 1 $, which we already suspect.\\n\\nBut here's the point: $ a $ and $ b $ are positive integers, so $ 2a + 6b $ is a positive integer, and the congruences hold modulo $ m $. But the actual value of $ 2a + 6b $ might be determined if we assume it's minimized or something? Not clear.\\n\\nWait — recall that $ n $ is the answer to the problem, and $ m = n+1 $. But $ n $ is the answer, so $ m = (answer) + 1 $. But the answer we're seeking is the **maximum possible inradius** of quadrilateral $ ABCD $ with sides $ \\\\ell, 3, 5, 4 $, where $ \\\\ell = m - 95 $.\\n\\nSo $ m = \\\\ell + 95 $, and $ m = n+1 $, and $ n = answer $. So:\\n\\n$ m = answer + 1 $  \\n$ \\\\ell = m - 95 = (answer + 1) - 95 = answer - 94 $\\n\\nBut also $ \\\\ell $ is the length $ AB $, so $ AB = \\\\ell = answer - 94 $\\n\\nBut $ answer $ is the maximum inradius $ r $, so:\\n\\n$ AB = r - 94 $\\n\\nBut $ AB $ is a side length, must be positive, so $ r > 94 $.\\n\\nBut we’re to find the maximum possible inradius of a quadrilateral with side lengths $ \\\\ell, 3, 5, 4 $, where $ \\\\ell = m - 95 $, and $ m = n+1 $, $ n = answer $. So again:\\n\\n$ \\\\ell = (answer + 1) - 95 = answer - 94 $\\n\\nSo $ AB = r - 94 $, where $ r $ is the inradius.\\n\\nNow, for a tangential quadrilateral (one with an incircle), the area is $ A = r \\\\cdot s $, where $ s $ is the semiperimeter.\\n\\nBut more importantly, a quadrilateral has an incircle **if and only if** the sums of opposite sides are equal:\\n\\n$$\\nAB + CD = BC + DA\\n$$\\n\\nThat is:\\n\\n$ \\\\ell + 5 = 3 + 4 = 7 $  \\n$ \\\\Rightarrow \\\\ell = 2 $\\n\\nSo for the quadrilateral to have an incircle at all, we must have $ \\\\ell = 2 $.\\n\\nMoreover, among all quadrilaterals with given side lengths, the one with the **maximum inradius** occurs when it is **tangential**, because only then does an incircle exist. And for fixed side lengths, the area is maximized when the quadrilateral is cyclic (Brahmagupta), but for inradius, $ r = A/s $, so for fixed perimeter, larger area gives larger $ r $, but to even have an incircle, we need the tangential condition.\\n\\nBut the problem says “maximum possible radius of a circle inscribed” — this implies we are to consider configurations where an incircle exists, and maximize $ r $.\\n\\nBut an incircle exists only if $ AB + CD = BC + DA $, i.e., $ \\\\ell + 5 = 3 + 4 = 7 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\ell = 2 $.\\n\\nTherefore, **only when $ \\\\ell = 2 $** can there be an incircle.\\n\\nHence, $ \\\\ell = 2 $.\\n\\nThen $ m = \\\\ell + 95 = 2 + 95 = 97 $\\n\\nThen $ n = m - 1 = 96 $\\n\\nBut $ n $ is supposed to be the answer to the problem. However, the answer we are to output is the **maximum possible inradius**, not $ n $.\\n\\nWait — reread:\\n\\n> Let $ n $ be the answer to this problem. ... Find $ 2a+6b $. Instead of determining the value of $ n $, simply find $ \\\\ell = m - 95 $, where $ m = n + 1 $ ...\\n\\nThen define quadrilateral with $ AB = \\\\ell $, etc., and ask: **What is the maximum possible radius of a circle inscribed in quadrilateral $ABCD$**?\\n\\nSo the final question is asking for that radius — **that is the answer**.\\n\\nBut $ n $ is defined as “the answer to this problem”, so $ n = $ (inradius).\\n\\nBut we just found that for an incircle to exist, $ \\\\ell = 2 $, so $ AB = 2 $.\\n\\nThen $ m = \\\\ell + 95 = 97 $, so $ n + 1 = 97 \\\\Rightarrow n = 96 $.\\n\\nBut $ n $ is the answer, so the inradius should be 96?\\n\\nBut let’s check: if $ \\\\ell = 2 $, sides are:\\n- AB = 2\\n- BC = 3\\n- CD = 5\\n- DA = 4\\n\\nCheck tangential condition:  \\nAB + CD = 2 + 5 = 7  \\nBC + DA = 3 + 4 = 7 → yes, equal, so incircle exists.\\n\\nSemiperimeter $ s = (2+3+5+4)/2 = 14/2 = 7 $\\n\\nArea $ A = r \\\\cdot s = 7r $\\n\\nBut we need to find the **maximum possible** inradius. But for fixed side lengths and tangential, is the inradius fixed?\\n\\nYes! For a tangential quadrilateral, the inradius is $ r = A / s $, but the area $ A $ can vary depending on the angles.\\n\\nWait — no: in a tangential quadrilateral, the area is $ r \\\\cdot s $, but $ r $ is constant only if the area is fixed. But actually, for fixed side lengths satisfying $ a+c = b+d $, the area is **not** fixed — you can flex the quadrilateral, changing the area, while maintaining an incircle?\\n\\nActually, **no**: for a quadrilateral to have an incircle, the sums of opposite sides must be equal, but once the side lengths are fixed and satisfy that, the area can still vary — however, the inradius would vary accordingly since $ A = r \\\\cdot s $, and $ s $ is fixed.\\n\\nBut can you have different areas with same side lengths and an incircle?\\n\\nYes — unlike triangles, for quadrilaterals with fixed side lengths and tangential property, the area is not uniquely determined. You can deform it while keeping the incircle tangent to all sides — but actually, it's tricky.\\n\\nWait: In a tangential quadrilateral, the area is $ A = r \\\\cdot s $, so for fixed $ s $, $ r $ is proportional to area. So maximizing $ r $ is equivalent to maximizing area.\\n\\nFor a quadrilateral with fixed side lengths, the **maximum area** is achieved when it is **cyclic** (i.e., Brahmagupta's formula applies). If, in addition, it is tangential, then it is **bicentric**.\\n\\nSo for our quadrilateral with sides 2, 3, 5, 4, and satisfying $ 2+5=3+4=7 $, it can have an incircle. Among all such quadrilaterals, the one with maximum area (hence maximum $ r $) is the **cyclic** one.\\n\\nSo we compute the area using **Brahmagupta’s formula**:\\n\\nFor cyclic quadrilateral with sides $ a,b,c,d $, and semiperimeter $ s $:\\n\\n$$\\nA = \\\\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}\\n$$\\n\\nHere: $ a=2, b=3, c=5, d=4 $, $ s = 7 $\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$ A = \\\\sqrt{(7-2)(7-3)(7-5)(7-4)} = \\\\sqrt{5 \\\\cdot 4 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 3} = \\\\sqrt{120} = 2\\\\sqrt{30} $\\n\\nThen inradius:\\n\\n$ r = A / s = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{30}}{7} $\\n\\nBut earlier we deduced $ \\\\ell = 2 $ from tangential condition, and $ m = 97 $, so $ n = 96 $, but this $ r \\\\approx 2\\\\times5.477/7 \\\\approx 10.954/7 \\\\approx 1.56 $, not 96.\\n\\nContradiction.\\n\\nBut wait — $ n $ is defined as the answer, so $ n = r $. But we also have $ m = n+1 = r+1 $, and $ \\\\ell = m - 95 = r + 1 - 95 = r - 94 $\\n\\nBut $ \\\\ell = AB $, and from tangential condition, $ \\\\ell + 5 = 3 + 4 = 7 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\ell = 2 $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$ \\\\ell = 2 = r - 94 \\\\Rightarrow r = 96 $\\n\\nAh! So we must have $ r = 96 $\\n\\nEven though Brahmagupta gives a small area, the logic of the self-referential definition forces $ r = 96 $\\n\\nLet’s follow the chain:\\n\\nLet $ r $ be the maximum possible inradius of quadrilateral $ABCD$ with $ AB = \\\\ell $, $ BC=3 $, $ CD=5 $, $ DA=4 $\\n\\nWe are told that $ \\\\ell = m - 95 $, $ m = n + 1 $, and $ n = r $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$ \\\\ell = (r + 1) - 95 = r - 94 $\\n\\nNow, for quadrilateral to have an incircle, we need:\\n\\n$ AB + CD = BC + DA \\\\Rightarrow \\\\ell + 5 = 3 + 4 = 7 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\ell = 2 $\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$ r - 94 = 2 \\\\Rightarrow r = 96 $\\n\\nMoreover, with $ \\\\ell = 2 $, the tangential condition is satisfied, so an incircle exists.\\n\\nNow, is it possible for such a quadrilateral to have inradius 96?\\n\\nSemiperimeter $ s = (2+3+5+4)/2 = 7 $\\n\\nThen area $ A = r \\\\cdot s = 96 \\\\times 7 = 672 $\\n\\nBut is this possible? The maximum possible area for a quadrilateral with these side lengths is given by Brahmagupta: $ \\\\sqrt{5\\\\cdot4\\\\cdot2\\\\cdot3} = \\\\sqrt{120} \\\\approx 10.95 $, far less than 672.\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nContradiction.\\n\\nSo either our assumption is wrong, or the only way out is that the self-referential definition overrides geometric feasibility?\\n\\nBut that can’t be.\\n\\nAlternative interpretation: perhaps $ \\\\ell = m - 95 $, and $ m = n+1 $, and $ n $ is the answer, but we are to find $ \\\\ell $ from the congruence system, then use that to build the quadrilateral, then find its maximum inradius.\\n\\nSo let’s go back.\\n\\nFrom the congruence system, we derived:\\n\\n$ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $  \\n$ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nSince $ a $ and $ b $ are positive integers, these congruences mean that $ 14b - 1 $ is divisible by $ m $, so $ m \\\\mid (14b - 1) $\\n\\nSimilarly, $ m \\\\mid (14a - 87) $\\n\\nSince $ m $ divides $ 14b - 1 $, and $ b \\\\geq 1 $, $ 14b - 1 \\\\geq 13 $, so $ m \\\\leq 14b - 1 $\\n\\nBut $ m $ is a positive integer divisor of $ 14b - 1 $\\n\\nSimilarly, $ m \\\\mid 14a - 87 $, so $ m \\\\leq |14a - 87| $ unless $ 14a = 87 $, impossible.\\n\\nBut more importantly, since $ m \\\\mid 14b - 1 $, then $ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $, so $ 14 $ has an inverse mod $ m $, so $ \\\\gcd(14, m) = 1 $\\n\\nAlso, from $ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m} $, this is consistent only if $ \\\\gcd(14, m) \\\\mid 87 $\\n\\nBut $ \\\\gcd(14, m) = 1 $, so always true.\\n\\nNow, since $ m \\\\mid 14b - 1 $, and $ b $ is a positive integer, $ 14b - 1 $ is a positive integer, and $ m $ is a divisor of it.\\n\\nSimilarly, $ m \\\\mid 14a - 87 $\\n\\nBut we also have the two original equations.\\n\\nLet’s subtract multiples.\\n\\nFrom earlier, we had:\\n\\n$ 7(2a + 6b) \\\\equiv 90 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nSo $ 7(2a + 6b) - 90 $ is divisible by $ m $\\n\\nLet $ k = 2a + 6b $, an integer ≥ 2(1)+6(1)=8\\n\\nThen $ 7k - 90 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{m} \\\\Rightarrow m \\\\mid (7k - 90) $\\n\\nBut also from $ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{m} $, so $ m \\\\mid (14b - 1) $\\n\\nAnd $ b $ is related to $ k = 2a + 6b $\\n\\nBut we also have $ 14a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nLet’s express $ a $ and $ b $ in terms of $ k $, but hard.\\n\\nNote that $ m $ divides both $ 14b - 1 $ and $ 7k - 90 $\\n\\nBut $ k = 2a + 6b $, and $ 14a \\\\equiv 87 $, so $ a \\\\equiv 87 \\\\cdot 14^{-1} \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nSimilarly, $ b \\\\equiv 14^{-1} \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nThen $ k = 2a + 6b \\\\equiv 2\\\\cdot87\\\\cdot14^{-1} + 6\\\\cdot14^{-1} = (174 + 6)\\\\cdot14^{-1} = 180 \\\\cdot 14^{-1} \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nThen $ 7k \\\\equiv 7 \\\\cdot 180 \\\\cdot 14^{-1} = 1260 / 14 = 90 \\\\pmod{m} $, which matches $ 7k \\\\equiv 90 \\\\pmod{m} $\\n\\nSo consistent.\\n\\nThe key is that $ m $ must divide $ 14b - 1 $ for some positive integer $ b $, and similarly for $ a $.\\n\\nBut also, from $ 7k - 90 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{m} $, and $ k = 2a+6b $, but perhaps the smallest possible $ m $ is what makes sense.\\n\\nBut recall: we are to find $ \\\\ell = m - 95 $, then form quadrilateral with sides $ \\\\ell, 3, 5, 4 $, and find max possible inradius.\\n\\nFor that quadrilateral to have an incircle, we need $ \\\\ell + 5 = 3 + 4 = 7 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\ell = 2 $\\n\\nSo $ m - 95 = 2 \\\\Rightarrow m = 97 $\\n\\nCould $ m = 97 $ work?\\n\\nCheck if $ \\\\gcd(14, 97) = 1 $: 97 is prime, not dividing 14, yes.\\n\\nDoes 14 have an inverse mod 97? Yes.\\n\\nWe need $ 14b \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{97} $\\n\\nSolve: $ b \\\\equiv 14^{-1} \\\\mod 97 $\\n\\nFind inverse of 14 mod 97.\\n\\nUse extended Euclidean algorithm:\\n\\n97 = 6*14 + 13  \\n14 = 1*13 + 1  \\n13 = 13*1 + 0\\n\\nSo gcd = 1\\nBack:\\n1 = 14 - 1*13 = 14 - 1*(97 - 6*14) = 7*14 - 1*97\\nSo 1 = 7*14 - 97 => 14^{-1} ≡ 7 mod 97\\n\\nSo b ≡ 7 mod 97\\n\\nSimilarly, 14a ≡ 87 mod 97\\nMultiply both sides by 7: a ≡ 87*7 = 609 mod 97\\n97*6 = 582, 609 - 582 = 27, so a ≡ 27 mod 97\\n\\nSo a = 27, b = 7 are solutions (smallest positive)\\n\\nCheck original equations mod 97:\\n\\n3a+5b = 3*27 + 5*7 = 81 + 35 = 116\\n116 mod 97 = 116 - 97 = 19 → matches 19 mod 97\\n\\n4a+2b = 4*27 + 2*7 = 108 + 14 = 122\\n122 - 97 = 25 → matches 25 mod 97\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nSo with m = 97, we have solution a=27, b=7.\\n\\nThen ℓ = m - 95 = 97 - 95 = 2\\n\\nNow quadrilateral ABCD with AB=2, BC=3, CD=5, DA=4\\n\\nFor incircle: AB+CD=2+5=7, BC+DA=3+4=7 → equal, so incircle exists.\\n\\nNow, what is the maximum possible inradius?\\n\\nAs before, for fixed side lengths, the area is maximized when the quadrilateral is cyclic, and since it's also tangential, it's bicentric.\\n\\nUse Brahmagupta’s formula:\\n\\ns = 7\\nA = √[(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)] = √[5*4*2*3] = √120 = 2√30\\n\\nThen r = A / s = 2√30 / 7\\n\\nBut is this the maximum? Yes, because for fixed side lengths, the cyclic quadrilateral has the maximum area, hence maximum r since s is fixed.\\n\\nBut earlier we thought n = answer = r, and m = n+1 = r+1, but here m=97, so r+1=97 ⇒ r=96, but 2√30/7 ≈ 1.56 ≠ 96.\\n\\nBut the self-reference is: “Let n be the answer to this problem.”\\n\\nThe answer to this problem is the inradius, so n = r.\\n\\nBut we have m = n+1 = r+1\\n\\nBut from congruence, m=97, so r+1=97 ⇒ r=96\\n\\nBut geometrically, r = 2√30/7 ≈ 1.56\\n\\nContradiction.\\n\\nUnless… the “answer” n is not the inradius, but the inradius is what we are to output, and n is defined as that answer.\\n\\nBut in the chain, we used the congruence to find m=97, which is consistent with a,b integers.\\n\\nAnd ℓ =2, and for the quadrilateral, the maximum inradius is 2√30/7.\\n\\nPerhaps the self-reference is a red herring, or we are to ignore it after using it to get m.\\n\\nBut the problem says: “Let n be the answer to this problem.” Then gives congruences mod n+1. Then says “instead of determining n, find ℓ = m - 95 where m = n+1”.\\n\\nBut if n is the inradius, and we find inradius later, it’s circular.\\n\\nHowever, in our calculation, we found that m=97 works perfectly with integer a,b, and yields ℓ=2, and the quadrilateral can have an incircle.\\n\\nMoreover, are there other possible m?\\n\\nFor example, could m be a divisor of 14b-1 for some b?\\n\\nFor b=7, 14*7-1=98-1=97, which is prime.\\n\\nSo divisors are 1 and 97.\\n\\nm=1: then congruences mod 1 are always true, but then ℓ =1-95= -94, not possible for side length.\\n\\nNext, b=7+97=104, then 14*104-1=1456-1=1455, m could be a divisor of 1455.\\n\\nBut then a would be larger, but m could be other values.\\n\\nFor example, if b=1, 14*1-1=13, so m|13, m=13 (since m>1 probably)\\nThen b≡14^{-1} mod 13\\n14≡1 mod 13, so 14^{-1}≡1, so b≡1\\nThen 14a≡87 mod 13\\n14≡1, 87÷13=6*13=78, 87-78=9, so a≡9 mod 13\\nCheck original:\\n3a+5b=3*9+5*1=27+5=32≡32-2*13=32-26=6≢19 mod 13 (19-13=6) → 6≡6 ok\\n4a+2b=4*9+2*1=36+2=38≡38-2*13=38-26=12, 25 mod 13=25-13*1=12 → ok\\nSo m=13 works with a=9,b=1\\nThen ℓ=m-95=13-95=-82<0 invalid\\n\\nNext, b=2, 14*2-1=27, m|27, m=3,9,27\\nTry m=27\\nThen 14b≡1 mod 27, b=2: 28≡1 mod 27? 28-27=1, yes\\n14a≡87 mod 27\\n87÷27=3*27=81, 87-81=6\\n14a≡6 mod 27\\nDivide by 2: 7a≡3 mod 27\nTry a= ? 7a≡3 mod 27\nInverse of 7 mod 27: 7*?=1 mod 27\n7*4=28≡1, so inv=4\na≡12 mod 27\na=12\nCheck:\n3a+5b=36+10=46≡46-27=19? 46-27=19, yes\n4a+2b=48+4=52≡52-1*27=25? 52-27=25, yes\nSo m=27 works\nℓ=27-95= -68<0 invalid\nLarger b will give larger 14b-1, but ℓ=m-95, so need m>95\nSmallest m>95 that divides 14b-1 for some b\nFor b=7, 14*7-1=97, prime, so m=97 is candidate\nℓ=2>0, good\nNext, b=8, 14*8-1=112-1=111, divisors: 3,37,111\nm=111>95, ℓ=111-95=16\nCheck if 14a≡87 mod 111\nFirst, gcd(14,111)=? 111=7*15+6, etc., 14 and 111, 111÷14=7*14=98, rem 13, then gcd(14,13)=1, so ok\n14a≡87 mod 111\nSolve: need inverse of 14 mod 111\nOr try if solution exists\nBut also need to satisfy original system\nFrom earlier, we have consistency via the elimination, so as long as 14b≡1 mod m and 14a≡87 mod m, and m|14b-1, then for b such that m|14b-1, then b is determined mod m\nFor m=111, 14b≡1 mod 111\nSolve: gcd(14,111)=1, so solution\n111=7*14 + 13? 14*7=98, 111-98=13\n14=1*13+1\n13=13*1+0\n1=14-1*13=14-1*(111-7*14)=8*14 -1*111\nSo 14^{-1}≡8 mod 111\nSo b≡8 mod 111\nThen 14a≡87 mod 111\nMultiply by 8: a≡87*8=696 mod 111\n111*6=666, 696-666=30, so a≡30 mod 111\nCheck:\n3a+5b=90+40=130≡130-111=19 yes\n4a+2b=120+16=136≡136-111=25 yes\nSo works\nℓ=16\nThen quadrilateral with AB=16, BC=3, CD=5, DA=4\nFor incircle: AB+CD=16+5=21, BC+DA=3+4=7≠21, so not tangential, cannot have incircle\nBut the problem asks for the maximum possible radius of a circle inscribed — if no incircle, is there any inscribed circle?\nTypically, \"inscribed\" means tangent to all four sides, which requires the quadrilateral to be tangential.\nOtherwise, you might have a circle tangent to three sides, but not necessarily all four.\nBut the maximum possible inradius usually assumes a tangential quadrilateral.\nSo only when ℓ+5=7, i.e., ℓ=2, can there be an incircle.\nFor other ℓ, no incircle exists, so the inradius is 0 or undefined.\nBut the problem asks for the maximum possible, so likely over configurations where an incircle exists.\nSo only ℓ=2 allows that.\nAmong all m that allow integer a,b and ℓ=m-95≥0 and allow incircle, only m=97 gives ℓ=2.\nOther m like m=97*k for k>1, but m|14b-1, 14b-1=97 for b=7, next is b=7+97=104, 14*104-1=1456-1=1455\n1455÷5=291, 291÷3=97, so 1455=3*5*97\nSo divisors include 97, 3*97=291, 5*97=485, 15*97=1455\nSo m=291, ℓ=291-95=196\nThen AB=196, then AB+CD=196+5=201, BC+DA=7, not equal, so not tangential.\nSimilarly for others.\nOnly when ℓ=2 do we have a chance for an incircle.\nAnd for ℓ=2, m=97, which works with a=27,b=7.\nSo we take ℓ=2.\nThen quadrilateral with sides 2,3,5,4, tangential, semiperimeter s=7.\nMaximum area when cyclic, A=√[(7-2)(7-3)(7-5)(7-4)]=√[5*4*2*3]=√120=2√30\nThen r = A/s = 2√30 / 7\nSo the maximum possible inradius is 2√30 / 7\nBut earlier self-reference suggests n=r, m=n+1=r+1, but we have m=97, so r=96, but 2√30/7 ≠96.\nHowever, the self-reference might be resolved by the fact that we used the system to find m=97 independently, leading to ℓ=2, and then the inradius is 2√30/7.\nPerhaps \"let n be the answer\" is a way to define n, but we are instructed to find ℓ = m - 95 with m=n+1, but since we can solve the system for m without knowing n, we did so.\nAnd the only viable m that gives non-negative ℓ and allows incircle is m=97, ℓ=2.\nThus, the inradius is 2√30 / 7.\nSo answer is 2√30 / 7.\nBut let's confirm if there are other m where ℓ=m-95, and ℓ+5=7, so ℓ=2, m=97 only.\nYes.\nSo regardless of the self-reference, the only logical choice is m=97, ℓ=2, and then the maximum inradius is 2√30 / 7.\nSo we go with that.\",\n    \"answer\": \"2\\\\sqrt{30}/7\"\n}\n{\n    \"answer\": \"2\\\\sqrt{30}/7\"\n}",
