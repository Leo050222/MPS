Find $n$ Instead of identifying the 4-digit perfect square satisfying the digit increment condition, simply find $m = a - 42$, where $a$ is the integer whose square is that number. P is a polynomial. When P is divided by $x-1$, the remainder is -4 . When P is divided by $x-2$, the remainder is -1 . When $P$ is divided by $x-3$, the remainder is 4 .

  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given a multi-part problem, but the final goal is to find the remainder when polynomial $ P(x) $ is divided by a certain cubic polynomial, after determining $ m = a - 42 $, where $ a^2 = n $, and $ n $ is a 4-digit square satisfying digit conditions.\\n\\nLet's break this down step by step.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step 1: Find 4-digit square $ n $ such that all digits < 6, and adding 1 to each digit gives another square.**\\n\\nLet $ n $ be a 4-digit perfect square: $ 1000 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 9999 $ ⇒ $ 32 \\\\leq a \\\\leq 99 $\\n\\nCondition: All digits of $ n $ are less than 6 (i.e., digits ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5})\\n\\nAlso, if we add 1 to each digit of $ n $, we get another number, say $ m $, which is also a perfect square.\\n\\nNote: Adding 1 to each digit means:\\n- If digit is d, it becomes d+1\\n- So, for example, if $ n = 1234 $, then new number is 2345\\n- But only valid if no digit is 9 (but here digits < 6, so d+1 ≤ 6, so no carry-over)\\n\\nSo transformation is digit-wise +1, no carry.\\n\\nLet’s denote:\\n- $ n = a^2 $\\n- Let $ f(n) $ = number formed by adding 1 to each digit of $ n $\\n- Then $ f(n) = b^2 $ for some integer $ b $\\n\\nSince $ n $ is 4-digit, $ f(n) $ is also 4-digit because leading digit of $ n $ is at least 1 and less than 6 → becomes 2 to 6, so still 4-digit.\\n\\nTry to search for such $ n $.\\n\\nLet’s list 4-digit squares where all digits < 6.\\n\\nWe can write a small logical search.\\n\\nLet’s loop over $ a $ from 32 to 99, compute $ a^2 $, check if all digits < 6, then compute $ f(a^2) $, check if it’s a perfect square.\\n\\nBut since we’re doing it manually, let’s narrow.\\n\\nNote: $ f(n) $ is obtained by adding 1 to each digit. That is equivalent to adding:\\n- 1111 if all digits are increased by 1\\n\\nWait! Is that true?\\n\\nYes — if you add 1 to each digit, and there is no carry (which there isn’t, since digits < 6 → become ≤6), then:\\n\\n$ f(n) = n + 1111 $\\n\\nBecause:\\n- Units digit: +1 → +1\\n- Tens digit: +1 → +10\\n- Hundreds: +1 → +100\\n- Thousands: +1 → +1000\\n- Total: 1111\\n\\nSo $ f(n) = n + 1111 $\\n\\nAnd both $ n $ and $ n + 1111 $ are perfect squares.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nLet $ a^2 = n $\\n$ b^2 = n + 1111 $\\n⇒ $ b^2 - a^2 = 1111 $\\n⇒ $ (b - a)(b + a) = 1111 $\\n\\nNow factor 1111.\\n\\n1111 ÷ 11 = 101\\nSo 1111 = 11 × 101\\nBoth prime.\\n\\nSo positive factor pairs of 1111:\\n(1, 1111), (11, 101)\\n\\nNow solve:\\n$ b - a = d $\\n$ b + a = 1111/d $\\n\\nCase 1: $ b - a = 1 $, $ b + a = 1111 $\\nAdd: 2b = 1112 ⇒ b = 556, a = 555\\nThen $ a^2 = 555^2 = 308025 $ → 6-digit → too big\\n\\nCase 2: $ b - a = 11 $, $ b + a = 101 $\\nAdd: 2b = 112 ⇒ b = 56, a = 45\\nThen $ a^2 = 2025 $\\nCheck digits: 2,0,2,5 → all < 6? Yes.\\nAdd 1 to each digit: 3,1,3,6 → 3136\\nIs 3136 a square? $ \\\\sqrt{3136} = 56 $, yes!\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nAny other factor pair? (101, 11): $ b - a = 101 $, $ b + a = 11 $ → subtract: 2a = -90 → negative, invalid\\nSimilarly (1111,1): too big\\n\\nSo only solution: $ a = 45 $, $ n = 2025 $\\n\\nNow, problem says: Instead of identifying $ n $, find $ m = a - 42 $\\nHere $ a = 45 $, so $ m = 45 - 42 = 3 $\\n\\nSo $ m = 3 $\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step 2: Polynomial $ P(x) $ with remainders:**\\n\\nGiven:\\n- $ P(1) = -4 $ (remainder when divided by $ x-1 $)\\n- $ P(2) = -1 $\\n- $ P(3) = 4 $\\n\\nNow, we are to find the remainder when $ P(x) $ is divided by:\\n$ x^m - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 $\\nBut $ m = 3 $, so this is:\\n$ x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 $\\n\\nNow, factor this polynomial.\\nTry rational roots: possible ±1,2,3,6\\nTry $ x=1 $: $ 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0 $ → yes\\nDivide:\\n$ x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = (x-1)(x^2 - 5x + 6) $\\nNow $ x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-2)(x-3) $\\nSo full factorization: $ (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) $\\n\\nSo the divisor is $ (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) $\\n\\nWe are to find the remainder when $ P(x) $ is divided by this cubic.\\n\\nSince divisor is degree 3, remainder $ R(x) $ is degree ≤ 2:\\n$ R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $\\n\\nAnd by division algorithm:\\n$ P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) Q(x) + R(x) $\\n\\nThen:\\n$ P(1) = R(1) = -4 $\\n$ P(2) = R(2) = -1 $\\n$ P(3) = R(3) = 4 $\\n\\nSo we need to find quadratic $ R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $ such that:\\n1. $ R(1) = a + b + c = -4 $\\n2. $ R(2) = 4a + 2b + c = -1 $\\n3. $ R(3) = 9a + 3b + c = 4 $\\n\\nSolve system:\\n\\nEq1: $ a + b + c = -4 $\\nEq2: $ 4a + 2b + c = -1 $\\nEq3: $ 9a + 3b + c = 4 $\\n\\nSubtract Eq1 from Eq2:\\n(4a+2b+c) - (a+b+c) = -1 - (-4) ⇒ 3a + b = 3  → (A)\\n\\nSubtract Eq2 from Eq3:\\n(9a+3b+c) - (4a+2b+c) = 4 - (-1) ⇒ 5a + b = 5 → (B)\\n\\nNow (B) - (A): (5a + b) - (3a + b) = 5 - 3 ⇒ 2a = 2 ⇒ a = 1\\n\\nFrom (A): 3(1) + b = 3 ⇒ b = 0\\nFrom Eq1: 1 + 0 + c = -4 ⇒ c = -5\\n\\nSo $ R(x) = x^2 + 0x - 5 = x^2 - 5 $\\n\\nTherefore, the remainder is $ x^2 - 5 $\\n\\nBut the question asks: \\\"Determine the remainder...\\\"\\nSo answer is the polynomial $ x^2 - 5 $\\n\\nBut in the required format, we must put the answer as a string.\\n\\nHowever, note: the final instruction says “Provide your final answer in the exact JSON format”, and inside “answer” field, just the value.\\n\\nSo we write the polynomial as a string.\\n\",\n    \"answer\": \"x^2 - 5\"\n}",
