  "math_problem": "Consider the following flowchart: INPUT $\\rightarrow$ Subtract $8 \\rightarrow \\square \\rightarrow$ Divide by $2 \\rightarrow \\square$ Add $16 \\rightarrow$ OUTPUT. If the OUTPUT is 32, what was the INPUT? Instead of determining the initial input value that produces the specified output via the flowchart's sequence of operations, simply find $k = A - 26$, where $A$ is the intermediate quantity at the first square after the subtraction step. What is the $y$-intercept of the line $y = x + 4$ after it is translated down $k$ units?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given a flowchart and asked to find the y-intercept of a line after a translation, based on a value k derived from an intermediate step in the flowchart.\\n\\nStep 1: Understand the flowchart\\n\\nThe flowchart is:\\n\\nINPUT → Subtract 8 → [A] → Divide by 2 → [B] → Add 16 → OUTPUT = 32\\n\\nLet:\\n- INPUT = x\\n- After subtracting 8: A = x - 8\\n- Then divide by 2: B = (x - 8) / 2\\n- Then add 16: OUTPUT = (x - 8)/2 + 16\\n\\nWe are told OUTPUT = 32:\\n\\n(x - 8)/2 + 16 = 32\\n\\nSolve for x:\\n\\n(x - 8)/2 = 16\\n\\nx - 8 = 32\\n\\nx = 40\\n\\nSo the INPUT is 40.\\n\\nNow compute A = x - 8 = 40 - 8 = 32\\n\\nNow compute k = A - 26 = 32 - 26 = 6\\n\\nSo k = 6\\n\\nNow consider the line y = x + 4. Its y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0: y = 0 + 4 = 4\\n\\nNow translate this line down by k = 6 units. The new y-intercept is:\\n\\n4 - 6 = -2\\n\\nThus, the y-intercept after translation is -2.\",\n    \"answer\": \"-2\"\n}",
