  "math_problem": "Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. Friday, at which point it had been on for exactly 100 hours. At what time had Kamile turned her computer on? Instead of determining the exact time the computer was turned on, simply find $k = h + 7$, where $h$ is the remainder obtained by dividing the total duration the computer was on by the number of hours in a day. Three different numbers from the list $2, 3, 4, 6$ have a sum of $k$. What is the product of these numbers?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are told that Kamile turned her computer off at 5 p.m. on Friday, and at that point it had been on for exactly 100 hours.\n\nWe are not asked to find the exact time she turned it on, but instead to compute:\n\n- $ k = h + 7 $, where $ h $ is the remainder when 100 is divided by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day).\n- Then, we must find three different numbers from the list $ \\{2, 3, 4, 6\\} $ that sum to $ k $, and report their product.\n\nLet’s solve step by step.\n\nStep 1: Compute $ h = 100 \\mod 24 $\n\nDivide 100 by 24:\n$ 24 \\times 4 = 96 $\n$ 100 - 96 = 4 $\nSo, $ h = 4 $\n\nStep 2: Compute $ k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 $\n\nSo $ k = 11 $\n\nStep 3: Find three different numbers from $ \\{2, 3, 4, 6\\} $ that sum to 11.\n\nList all combinations of three different numbers from the set:\n\n- 2, 3, 4 → sum = 9\n- 2, 3, 6 → sum = 11 ← this works\n- 2, 4, 6 → sum = 12\n- 3, 4, 6 → sum = 13\n\nOnly one combination sums to 11: 2, 3, and 6.\n\nStep 4: Compute the product of these numbers:\n\n$ 2 \\times 3 \\times 6 = 36 $\n\nFinal answer is 36.\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"36\"\n}",
