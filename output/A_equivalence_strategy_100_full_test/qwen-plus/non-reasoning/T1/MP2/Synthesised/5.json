  "math_problem": "Many of the students in M. Gamache's class brought a skateboard or a bicycle to school yesterday. The ratio of the number of skateboards to the number of bicycles was $7:4$. There were 12 more skateboards than bicycles. How many skateboards and bicycles were there in total? Instead of determining the total number of skateboards and bicycles, simply find $d = k + 6$, where $k$ is the scaling factor such that the number of skateboards is $7k$ and the number of bicycles is $4k$. Shuxin begins with $d$ red candies, 7 yellow candies, and 3 blue candies. After eating some of the candies, there are equal numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies remaining. What is the smallest possible number of candies that Shuxin ate?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"We are given a ratio of skateboards to bicycles as 7:4. Let the number of skateboards be 7k and the number of bicycles be 4k, where k is the scaling factor.\\n\\nWe are told there were 12 more skateboards than bicycles:\\n\\n7k = 4k + 12\\n\\nSubtract 4k from both sides:\\n\\n3k = 12  \\n=> k = 4\\n\\nNow, we are asked to find d = k + 6:\\n\\nd = 4 + 6 = 10\\n\\nSo Shuxin begins with:\\n- d = 10 red candies\\n- 7 yellow candies\\n- 3 blue candies\\n\\nShuxin eats some candies so that the remaining numbers of red, yellow, and blue candies are equal.\\n\\nLet r be the number of each color remaining. Then r must satisfy:\\n\\nr ≤ 10 (red)\\nr ≤ 7  (yellow)\\nr ≤ 3  (blue)\\n\\nSo the maximum possible value of r is min(10, 7, 3) = 3.\\n\\nTo minimize the number of candies eaten, we want to maximize the number remaining. So set r = 3.\\n\\nThen:\\n- Remaining: 3 red, 3 yellow, 3 blue\\n- Initially: 10 red, 7 yellow, 3 blue\\n- So candies eaten:\\n  - Red: 10 - 3 = 7\\n  - Yellow: 7 - 3 = 4\\n  - Blue: 3 - 3 = 0\\n- Total eaten: 7 + 4 + 0 = 11\\n\\nIs it possible to eat fewer than 11?\\n\\nTry r = 2:\\n- Remaining: 2 of each\\n- Eaten: (10−2)+(7−2)+(3−2) = 8+5+1 = 14 > 11 → worse\\n\\nr = 1: (9+6+2)=17 → worse\\nr = 0: 10+7+3=20 → worse\\n\\nSo minimum candies eaten is when r = 3, total eaten = 11.\\n\\nThus, the smallest possible number of candies Shuxin ate is 11.\",\n    \"answer\": \"11\"\n}",
