  "math_problem": "When three consecutive integers are added, the total is 27. What is the result when the same three integers are multiplied? Instead of determining the product of the three consecutive integers, simply find $p = 100\\left(m - \\frac{177}{20}\\right)$, where $m$ is the middle integer among the three consecutive integers. If $x \\%$ of 60 is 12, what is $p \\%$ of $x$?",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Find the three consecutive integers whose sum is 27.\n\nLet the three consecutive integers be:\n- (m - 1), m, (m + 1), where m is the middle integer.\n\nTheir sum:\n(m - 1) + m + (m + 1) = 3m\n\nWe are told this sum is 27:\n3m = 27  \n=> m = 9\n\nSo the middle integer m is 9.\n\nStep 2: Compute p = 100(m - 177/20)\n\nFirst compute 177/20:\n177 ÷ 20 = 8.85\n\nNow:\nm - 177/20 = 9 - 8.85 = 0.15\n\nThen:\np = 100 × 0.15 = 15\n\nSo p = 15\n\nStep 3: Find x such that x% of 60 is 12.\n\nx% of 60 = 12  \n=> (x/100) × 60 = 12  \n=> (60x)/100 = 12  \n=> 0.6x = 12  \n=> x = 12 / 0.6 = 20\n\nSo x = 20\n\nStep 4: What is p% of x?\n\nWe have:\np = 15 → so p% = 15%\nx = 20\n\nNow compute 15% of 20:\n(15/100) × 20 = 0.15 × 20 = 3\n\nFinal answer: 3\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"3\"\n}",
