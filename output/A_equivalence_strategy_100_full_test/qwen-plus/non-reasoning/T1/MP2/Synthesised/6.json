  "math_problem": "If $x$ and $y$ are positive integers with $x+y=31$, what is the largest possible value of $x y$? Instead of finding the largest possible value of the product $x y$, simply find $k$, which is that largest value minus 231. If a line segment joins the points $(-k,-2)$ and $(6,8)$, how many points on the line segment have coordinates that are both integers?",
  "reasoning_content": "We are given that $ x + y = 31 $, where $ x $ and $ y $ are positive integers. We want to maximize the product $ xy $. Then we define $ k $ as the maximum value of $ xy $ minus 231. After finding $ k $, we use it to determine how many points on the line segment joining $ (-k, -2) $ and $ (6, 8) $ have integer coordinates.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Maximize $ xy $ given $ x + y = 31 $**\n\nLet $ x + y = 31 $. The product $ xy $ is maximized when $ x $ and $ y $ are as close as possible to each other, due to the AM-GM inequality.\n\nSo, try $ x = 15 $, $ y = 16 $ → $ xy = 15 \\times 16 = 240 $\n\nOr $ x = 16 $, $ y = 15 $ → same product: 240\n\nCheck others:\n- $ x = 14, y = 17 $ → $ 14 \\times 17 = 238 $\n- $ x = 13, y = 18 $ → $ 234 $\n- So yes, maximum is at $ 15 \\times 16 = 240 $\n\nThus, the **maximum value of $ xy $** is $ 240 $.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Compute $ k = 240 - 231 $**\n\n$$\nk = 240 - 231 = 9\n$$\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Find how many points with integer coordinates lie on the line segment joining $ (-k, -2) $ and $ (6, 8) $**\n\nSince $ k = 9 $, the first point is $ (-9, -2) $, and the second is $ (6, 8) $\n\nWe need to count the number of **lattice points** (points with integer coordinates) on the line segment between these two points, **including the endpoints**.\n\nThere is a formula for this:\n\n> The number of lattice points on the line segment between $ (x_1, y_1) $ and $ (x_2, y_2) $, where all coordinates are integers, is:\n> $$\n> \\gcd(|x_2 - x_1|, |y_2 - y_1|) + 1\n> $$\n\nThis counts the number of integer points on the segment, including endpoints.\n\nLet’s compute:\n\n- $ \\Delta x = 6 - (-9) = 15 $\n- $ \\Delta y = 8 - (-2) = 10 $\n- $ \\gcd(15, 10) = 5 $\n\nSo number of lattice points = $ 5 + 1 = 6 $\n\n---\n\nFinal answer: 6\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
