  "math_problem": "Storage space on a computer is measured in gigabytes (GB) and megabytes (MB), where $1 \\mathrm{~GB} = 1024 \\mathrm{MB}$. Julia has an empty 300 GB hard drive and puts 300000 MB of data onto it. How much storage space on the hard drive remains empty? Instead of determining the remaining empty storage space, simply find $d = C - 307100$, where $C$ is the total storage capacity of the hard drive expressed in megabytes derived from the given size in gigabytes. The regular price for a bicycle is $\\\\$320$. The bicycle is on sale for $20\\\\%$ off. The regular price for a helmet is $\\\\$80$. The helmet is on sale for $10\\\\%$ off. If Sandra bought both items on sale, her percentage savings on the total purchase is $\\left( \\frac{\\text{total savings}}{\\text{total price}} \\right) \\times d\\\\%$. Compute this value.",

Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\nStep 1: Convert the hard drive capacity from GB to MB.\\nWe are told that:\\n- 1 GB = 1024 MB\\n- Julia has a 300 GB hard drive\\n\\nSo, total capacity in MB:\\nC = 300 × 1024 = 307200 MB\\n\\nStep 2: We are asked to compute d = C - 307100\\nC = 307200\\nSo,\\nd = 307200 - 307100 = 100\\n\\nNow we use this d = 100 in the next part.\\n\\nStep 3: Calculate the regular total price and sale total price of the bicycle and helmet.\\n\\nBicycle:\\n- Regular price = $320\\n- On sale for 20% off → discount = 0.20 × 320 = $64\\n- Sale price = 320 - 64 = $256\\n\\nHelmet:\\n- Regular price = $80\\n- On sale for 10% off → discount = 0.10 × 80 = $8\\n- Sale price = 80 - 8 = $72\\n\\nTotal regular price = 320 + 80 = $400\\nTotal savings = 64 + 8 = $72\\nTotal sale price = 256 + 72 = $328 (or 400 - 72 = 328)\\n\\nStep 4: Compute the percentage savings on the total purchase.\\nPercentage savings = (total savings / total price) × 100%\\nBut the problem says: \\nSandra’s percentage savings is: (total savings / total price) × d %\\nWe already found d = 100\\n\\nSo:\\n= (72 / 400) × 100\\n= 0.18 × 100\\n= 18\\n\\nThus, the value is 18.\",\n    \"answer\": \"18\"\n}",
