Check divisibility:\\n391 ÷ 17 = 23 → 17 × 23 = 391.\\nAlso, 391 ÷ 1 = 391, and 391 ÷ 23 = 17, etc.\\nSo the positive factor pairs of 391 are:\\n(1, 391), (17, 23), (23, 17), (391, 1)\\n\\nNow, since x(1 + y) = 391, then:\\nx = one factor, and (1 + y) = the other.\\nSo possible cases:\\n\\nCase 1: x = 1, 1 + y = 391 → y = 390 → but x = 1, y = 390 → x < y → violates x > y.\\n\\nCase 2: x = 17, 1 + y = 23 → y = 22 → x = 17, y = 22 → x < y → invalid.\\n\\nCase 3: x = 23, 1 + y = 17 → y = 16 → x = 23, y = 16 → x > y → valid.\\nCheck original equation: x + xy = 23 + 23×16 = 23 + 368 = 391 → correct.\\n\\nCase 4: x = 391, 1 + y = 1 → y = 0 → not positive integer → invalid.\\n\\nOnly valid solution: x = 23, y = 16.\\nNow, k = y + 14 = 16 + 14 = 30.\\n\\nAnswer for Problem 1: 30.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nTotal people = 30.\\n60% are men → number of men = 0.6 × 30 = 18.\\nSo women = 30 - 18 = 12.\\n\\nLet w be the number of women who enter the room. No men enter or leave, so men remain 18.\\nTotal people after = 30 + w.\\nWe want men to be 40% of total:\\n18 = 0.4 × (30 + w)\\nSolve:\\n18 = 0.4(30 + w)\\n18 = 12 + 0.4w\\n18 - 12 = 0.4w → 6 = 0.4w → w = 6 / 0.4 = 15.\\n\\nSo 15 women must enter.\\n\\nAnswer for Problem 2: 15.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"30\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"15\"\n}",
