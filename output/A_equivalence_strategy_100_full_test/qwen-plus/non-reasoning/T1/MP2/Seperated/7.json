  "reasoning_content": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1:\\n\\nWe are given a circular spinner divided into six regions. Four of these regions each have a central angle of $x^\\\\circ$, and the remaining two regions have central angles of $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$. Since the total central angle in a circle is $360^\\\\circ$, we can write:\\n\\n$$\\n4x + 20 + 140 = 360\\n$$\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n$$\\n4x + 160 = 360\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n4x = 200 \\\\Rightarrow x = 50\\n$$\\n\\nSo each of the four regions has a central angle of $50^\\\\circ$. Now, we compute the total central angle of all regions to confirm:\\n\\n- Four regions: $4 \\\\times 50 = 200^\\\\circ$\\n- One region: $20^\\\\circ$\\n- One region: $140^\\\\circ$\\n- Total: $200 + 20 + 140 = 360^\\\\circ$ — correct.\\n\\nNow, the problem says to find $N = \\\\theta + 2700$, where $\\\\theta$ is the total central angle of the shaded regions. However, the problem does not specify which regions are shaded. But since it asks us to compute $N = \\\\theta + 2700$, and gives no further info about shading, this suggests that perhaps all non-$x$ regions or some specific ones are shaded — but wait, rereading the problem:\\n\\n> 'Instead of computing the probability that the arrow stops on a shaded region, simply find $N = \\\\theta + 2700$, where $\\\\theta$ is the total central angle in degrees of the shaded regions.'\\n\\nBut still, no information is given about which regions are shaded. This suggests that perhaps there is an error in interpretation.\\n\\nWait — actually, re-examining: maybe the shaded regions are implied? Or perhaps the question assumes that the regions with central angle $x^\\\\circ$ are shaded? Or the other way?\\n\\nBut no indication is given. However, notice that the only unusual thing is that four regions are equal (each $x^\\\\circ$), and two others are given: $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$. Perhaps the shaded regions are the four regions of $x^\\\\circ$? That would make sense as they are symmetric.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the shaded regions are the ones that are not standard? But again, no clue.\\n\\nWait — perhaps I missed something. Let's read carefully:\\n\\n> 'a circular spinner is divided into six regions, four regions each have a central angle of $x^\\\\circ$, and the remaining regions have central angles of $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$'\\n\\nSo total six regions: four of $x^\\\\circ$, one of $20^\\\\circ$, one of $140^\\\\circ$. We found $x = 50$.\\n\\nNow, the problem says: 'find $N = \\\\theta + 2700$, where $\\\\theta$ is the total central angle of the shaded regions'.\\n\\nBut without knowing which regions are shaded, we cannot proceed — unless the shaded regions are defined implicitly.\\n\\nWait — perhaps this is a trick. Maybe the shaded regions are the ones with angle $x^\\\\circ$, and there are four of them, so $\\\\theta = 4 \\\\times 50 = 200^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nThen $N = 200 + 2700 = 2900$.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the shaded regions are the $20^\\\\circ$ and $140^\\\\circ$ ones, then $\\\\theta = 20 + 140 = 160$, so $N = 160 + 2700 = 2860$.\\n\\nBut which is it?\\n\\nWait — the problem says: 'Instead of computing the probability... simply find $N = \\\\theta + 2700$'. This implies that $\\\\theta$ is known or computable from context. But no shading is described.\\n\\nThis suggests that perhaps the shaded regions are the four regions of $x^\\\\circ$. Why? Because otherwise, why mention $x$? The variable $x$ was used for those four, and we solved for it. It's likely that those are the shaded ones.\\n\\nMoreover, in typical problems, the shaded regions are the ones referred to by a variable. So assume the four regions of $50^\\\\circ$ each are shaded.\\n\\nThus, $\\\\theta = 4 \\\\times 50 = 200^\\\\circ$.\\n\\nThen $N = 200 + 2700 = 2900$.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 1: 2900.\\n\\nBut let me double-check: total shaded angle $\\\\theta = 200$, $N = 200 + 2700 = 2900$. Seems straightforward once $x$ is found.\\n\\nNow, Problem 2:\\n\\nWe are told that a pair $(m, n)$ is a happy pair if $\\\\gcd(m, n)$ is a perfect square.\\n\\nGiven: $k$ is a positive integer such that $(205800, 35k)$ is a happy pair, and $k \\\\leq 2940$. We need to find the number of possible values of $k$.\\n\\nLet $d = \\\\gcd(205800, 35k)$. We want $d$ to be a perfect square.\\n\\nStep 1: Factorize numbers.\\n\\nFirst, factorize 205800.\\n\\n$205800 = 2058 \\\\times 100$\\n\\n$100 = 2^2 \\\\times 5^2$\\n\\n$2058$: divide by 2: 1029\\n\\n$1029$: divisible by 3: $1+0+2+9=12$, yes: $1029 = 3 \\\\times 343$\\n\\n$343 = 7^3$\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$205800 = 2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 7^3 \\\\times 2^2 \\\\times 5^2 = 2^{3} \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5^2 \\\\times 7^3$\\n\\nDouble-check:\\n\\n$2^3 = 8$\\n\\n$5^2 = 25$\\n\\n$8 \\\\times 25 = 200$\\n\\n$200 \\\\times 3 = 600$\\n\\n$600 \\\\times 343$: $600 \\\\times 300 = 180000$, $600 \\\\times 43 = 25800$, total $205800$ — yes.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n$$\\n205800 = 2^3 \\\\times 3^1 \\\\times 5^2 \\\\times 7^3\\n$$\\n\\nNow, $35k = 5 \\\\times 7 \\\\times k$\\n\\nSo $35k = 5^1 \\\\times 7^1 \\\\times k$\\n\\nNow, $\\\\gcd(205800, 35k)$ depends on the prime factors of $k$.\\n\\nLet $g = \\\\gcd(205800, 35k)$\\n\\nSince $35k = 5 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot k$, and $205800 = 2^3 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 5^2 \\\\cdot 7^3$, the gcd will take the minimum exponent for each common prime.\\n\\nLet $k$ have prime factorization involving primes 2,3,5,7, and possibly others. But primes not in 205800 won't contribute to gcd, so we can assume $k$ is composed of primes 2,3,5,7 only, because any other prime factor in $k$ doesn't affect the gcd.\\n\\nSo let:\\n\\n$$\\nk = 2^a \\\\times 3^b \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7^d\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $a,b,c,d \\\\geq 0$ integers.\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n$$\\n35k = 2^a \\\\times 3^b \\\\times 5^{c+1} \\\\times 7^{d+1}\\n$$\\n\\nNow,\\n\\n$$\\ng = \\\\gcd(205800, 35k) = 2^{\\\\min(3,a)} \\\\times 3^{\\\\min(1,b)} \\\\times 5^{\\\\min(2,c+1)} \\\\times 7^{\\\\min(3,d+1)}\\n$$\\n\\nWe want $g$ to be a perfect square. So each exponent in its prime factorization must be even.\\n\\nSo we require:\\n\\n- $\\\\min(3,a)$ is even\\n- $\\\\min(1,b)$ is even\\n- $\\\\min(2,c+1)$ is even\\n- $\\\\min(3,d+1)$ is even\\n\\nNow analyze each condition.\\n\\n1. $\\\\min(3,a)$ even:\\n\\nPossible values of $\\\\min(3,a)$: since $a \\\\geq 0$, min(3,a) can be 0,1,2,3.\\nEven values: 0 or 2.\\n\\n- If $\\\\min(3,a) = 0$: then $a = 0$\\n- If $\\\\min(3,a) = 2$: then $a \\\\geq 2$, and min is 2 → so $a \\\\geq 2$, but min is 2 only if $a \\\\geq 2$ and since 3>a? No: min(3,a)=2 implies $a=2$ (because if a≥3, min=3; if a=2, min=2)\\n\\nWait:\\n- If $a < 3$, min = a\\n- If $a \\\\geq 3$, min = 3\\n\\nSo:\\n- $\\\\min(3,a) = a$ if $a \\\\leq 3$, else 3\\n\\nWe want this to be even: 0 or 2 (since 1 and 3 are odd).\\n\\nSo:\\n- Case 1: $\\\\min(3,a) = 0$ → $a = 0$\\n- Case 2: $\\\\min(3,a) = 2$ → $a = 2$\\n\\nBecause:\\n- If $a=0$: min=0 ✅\\n- $a=1$: min=1 ❌\\n- $a=2$: min=2 ✅\\n- $a=3$: min=3 ❌\\n- $a \\\\geq 4$: min=3 ❌\\n\\nSo only $a = 0$ or $a = 2$\\n\\n2. $\\\\min(1,b)$ even:\\n\\n$\\\\min(1,b)$:\\n- If $b = 0$: min=0 ✅ (even)\\n- If $b \\\\geq 1$: min=1 ❌ (odd)\\n\\nSo only possibility: $b = 0$\\n\\nBecause min(1,b) = 0 if b=0, 1 if b≥1. Only 0 is even.\\n\\nSo $b = 0$\\n\\n3. $\\\\min(2, c+1)$ even:\\n\\nLet $e = c+1$, so $e \\\\geq 1$\\n\\n$\\\\min(2,e)$:\\n- If $e = 1$: min=1 ❌\\n- If $e = 2$: min=2 ✅\\n- If $e \\\\geq 3$: min=2 ✅ (since min(2,e)=2 when e≥2)\\n\\nmin(2,e):\\n- e=1 → 1\\n- e≥2 → 2\\n\\nSo min is 1 if e=1, 2 if e≥2\\n\\nWe want it even → so min=2 → so e ≥ 2 → $c+1 \\\\geq 2$ → $c \\\\geq 1$\\n\\nSo $c \\\\geq 1$\\n\\n4. $\\\\min(3, d+1)$ even:\\n\\nLet $f = d+1 \\\\geq 1$\\n\\n$\\\\min(3,f)$:\\n- f=1 → min=1 ❌\\n- f=2 → min=2 ✅\\n- f=3 → min=3 ❌\\n- f≥4 → min=3 ❌\\n\\nSo min is:\\n- 1 if f=1\\n- 2 if f=2\\n- 3 if f≥3\\n\\nEven only when min=2 → so f=2 → $d+1 = 2$ → $d = 1$\\n\\nSo only $d = 1$\\n\\nSummary of conditions:\\n\\n- $a = 0$ or $a = 2$\\n- $b = 0$\\n- $c \\\\geq 1$\\n- $d = 1$\\n\\nSo $k = 2^a \\\\times 3^b \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7^d = 2^a \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7^1$, with $a \\\\in \\\\{0,2\\\\}$, $c \\\\geq 1$, $b=0$, $d=1$\\n\\nAlso, $k \\\\leq 2940$\\n\\nSo $k = 2^a \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7$, with $a=0$ or $2$, $c \\\\geq 1$\\n\\nLet’s compute $k$ in terms of $a$ and $c$:\\n\\nCase 1: $a = 0$ → $k = 1 \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7 = 7 \\\\times 5^c$\\n\\nCase 2: $a = 2$ → $k = 4 \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7 = 28 \\\\times 5^c$\\n\\nNow, $k \\\\leq 2940$\\n\\nFind all $c \\\\geq 1$ such that $k \\\\leq 2940$\\n\\nFirst, case 1: $k = 7 \\\\times 5^c \\\\leq 2940$\\n\\n$5^c \\\\leq 2940 / 7 = 420$\\n\\n$5^1 = 5$\\n$5^2 = 25$\\n$5^3 = 125$\\n$5^4 = 625 > 420$ → too big\\n\\nSo $c = 1,2,3$\\n\\nCheck:\\n- c=1: 7×5=35 ≤2940 ✅\\n- c=2: 7×25=175 ✅\\n- c=3: 7×125=875 ≤2940 ✅\\n- c=4: 7×625=4375 >2940 ❌\\n\\nSo c=1,2,3 → 3 values\\n\\nCase 2: $k = 28 \\\\times 5^c \\\\leq 2940$\\n\\n$5^c \\\\leq 2940 / 28$\\n\\nCompute: 2940 ÷ 28\\n\\n28 × 100 = 2800\\n2940 - 2800 = 140\\n28 × 5 = 140 → so 105\\n\\nSo 2940 / 28 = 105\\n\\nSo $5^c \\\\leq 105$\\n\\n$5^1=5$\\n$5^2=25$\\n$5^3=125 >105$ → too big\\n\\nSo c=1,2\\n\\nCheck:\\n- c=1: 28×5=140 ≤2940 ✅\\n- c=2: 28×25=700 ≤2940 ✅\\n- c=3: 28×125=3500 >2940 ❌\\n\\nSo c=1,2 → 2 values\\n\\nTotal number of $k$: case1: 3 values, case2: 2 values → total 5\\n\\nList them to verify:\\n\\nCase1 (a=0):\\n- c=1: k=7×5=35\\n- c=2: k=7×25=175\\n- c=3: k=7×125=875\\n\\nCase2 (a=2):\\n- c=1: k=28×5=140\\n- c=2: k=28×25=700\\n\\nAll ≤2940? Yes.\\n\\nNow check if $\\\\gcd(205800, 35k)$ is a perfect square for one of them.\\n\\nTake k=35: then 35k = 35×35 = 1225\\n\\n$\\\\gcd(205800, 1225)$\\n\\nFactor 1225: 35^2 = (5×7)^2 = 5^2 × 7^2\\n\\n205800 = 2^3 × 3 × 5^2 × 7^3\\n\\nSo gcd = 5^2 × 7^2 = 25×49=1225, which is (35)^2 — perfect square ✅\\n\\nAnother: k=140: 35k = 35×140 = 4900\\n\\n4900 = 100×49 = 2^2 × 5^2 × 7^2\\n\\ngcd with 205800: common primes 5 and 7\\n\\nmin(5): min(2,2)=2\\nmin(7): min(3,2)=2\\nno 2 in gcd because 205800 has 2^3, but 35k=35×140=35×(4×35)=4×35^2=2^2×5^2×7^2, so has 2^2, but 205800 has 2^3, so min=2\\n\\nBut wait: 35k = 35 × k = 35 × 140 = ?\\n\\nk=140=2^2×5×7\\n\\nSo 35k = 5×7 × 2^2×5×7 = 2^2 × 5^2 × 7^2\\n\\n205800 = 2^3 × 3 × 5^2 × 7^3\\n\\nSo gcd = 2^2 × 5^2 × 7^2 = (2×5×7)^2 = 70^2 — perfect square ✅\\n\\nNow k=875: k=875= 875÷25=35, 25×35=875? 25×35=875 yes, so 5^2 × 5×7=5^3×7? 875÷5=175, ÷5=35, ÷5=7 → 5^3×7\\n\\nSo k=5^3×7\\n\\nThen 35k=5×7×5^3×7=5^4×7^2\\n\\ngcd with 205800: 2^3×3×5^2×7^3\\n\\nSo min(5): min(2,4)=2\\nmin(7): min(3,2)=2\\nothers: no common 2 or 3? 35k has no 2 or 3, so gcd=5^2×7^2=(35)^2 — perfect square ✅\\n\\nSimilarly, all should work.\\n\\nAre there more? c=3 in case2: k=28×125=3500>2940 — excluded.\\n\\nc=4 in case1: 7×625=4375>2940 — excluded.\\n\\nSo only 5 values.\\n\\nBut wait: k must be positive integer, and we have five: 35,175,875,140,700.\\n\\nIs k=700 ≤2940? Yes.\\n\\nk=700: k=2^2×5^2×7? 4×25×7=700 yes.\\n\\n35k=35×700=24500= 35×7×100=245×100=24500\\n\\nBetter: 35k=5×7×700=5×7×(2^2×5^2×7)=2^2×5^3×7^2\\n\\n205800=2^3×3×5^2×7^3\\n\\ngcd=2^2×5^2×7^2=4×25×49=100×49=4900=70^2 — perfect square ✅\\n\\nAll good.\\n\\nSo 5 values.\\n\\nBut wait — is there any constraint that k must be such that no other primes? We assumed k has only primes 2,3,5,7. But what if k has another prime, say 11?\\n\\nSuppose k has a prime factor not in {2,3,5,7}, say p.\\n\\nThen 35k has that prime p, but 205800 does not, so gcd is unaffected — same as if we removed p.\\n\\nBut gcd(205800, 35k) depends only on the common prime factors.\\n\\nSo if k has extra prime factors, say k = k' × m, where m coprime to 205800, then 35k = 35k' × m, and since m shares no factors with 205800, gcd(205800, 35k) = gcd(205800, 35k')\\n\\nSo the gcd is the same as for k'.\\n\\nTherefore, for the gcd to be a perfect square, it only depends on the part of k that shares primes with 205800, i.e., primes 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nBut earlier we concluded b=0, so no factor of 3, and a,c,d as above.\\n\\nHowever, if k has an additional prime factor, say 11, then k is larger, but the gcd remains the same.\\n\\nBut we require k ≤ 2940.\\n\\nSo potentially, we could have k = k_0 × m, where m is coprime to 205800, and k_0 is one of the base values, and k ≤ 2940.\\n\\nBut wait — if m>1, then k = k_0 × m > k_0, so it might exceed 2940, but even if not, the gcd is determined only by k_0, so if gcd is perfect square for k_0, it is same for k_0×m, provided m coprime to 205800.\\n\\nBut is that true?\\n\\nExample: suppose k_0 = 35, which works.\\nLet k = 35 × 11 = 385\\nThen 35k = 35 × 385 = 35 × 35 × 11 = 1225 × 11\\nNow gcd(205800, 35k) = gcd(205800, 1225 × 11)\\nSince 11 does not divide 205800 (205800 ÷ 11? 11×18709=205799, not divisible), so gcd = gcd(205800, 1225) = 1225, same as before — perfect square.\\nAnd k=385 ≤2940? Yes.\\n\\nOh! So we missed this!\\n\\nSo k can have extra prime factors not dividing 205800, as long as k ≤ 2940, and the 'core' part satisfies the exponent conditions.\\n\\nBut what is the core? From earlier, the gcd depends only on the exponents of 2,3,5,7 in k.\\n\\nSpecifically, we required:\\n- For prime 2: exponent a in k must be 0 or 2\\n- For prime 3: exponent b in k must be 0\\n- For prime 5: exponent c in k must be ≥1\\n- For prime 7: exponent d in k must be 1\\n\\nAnd for any other prime, exponent can be anything, since it doesn't affect the gcd.\\n\\nBut k must be ≤ 2940.\\n\\nSo k must be of the form:\\n\\n$$\\nk = 2^a \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7^1 \\\\times m\\n$$\\n\\nwhere:\\n- $a = 0$ or $2$\\n- $c \\\\geq 1$\\n- $m$ is a positive integer coprime to $2,3,5,7$ — i.e., not divisible by 2,3,5,7. So $m$ is composed of primes ≥11.\\n\\nBut also, since b=0, no factor of 3, so m must not introduce factor of 3? No: m can have prime factors, but if it has 3, then b>0, which violates b=0.\\n\\nAh! Important point.\\n\\nIn our earlier analysis, $b$ is the exponent of 3 in $k$. We concluded $b$ must be 0.\\n\\nSo $k$ must not be divisible by 3.\\n\\nSimilarly, for prime 2: exponent must be exactly 0 or 2 — not 1,3,4,etc.\\nFor prime 5: exponent $c \\\\geq 1$\\nFor prime 7: exponent must be exactly 1 — not 0,2,3,etc.\\n\\nAnd for any other prime, say 11,13,etc., the exponent can be any non-negative integer, including 0.\\n\\nBut if we include a prime like 11, it's fine, as long as the exponents of 2,3,5,7 are as specified.\\n\\nSpecifically:\\n- Exponent of 2 in k: 0 or 2\\n- Exponent of 3 in k: 0\\n- Exponent of 5 in k: at least 1\\n- Exponent of 7 in k: exactly 1\\n- Other primes: any exponent\\n\\nAnd $k \\\\leq 2940$\\n\\nSo now, we need to count the number of such $k$.\\n\\nLet $k = 2^a \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7 \\\\times m$, where:\\n- $a \\\\in \\\\{0,2\\\\}$\\n- $c \\\\geq 1$\\n- $m$ is an integer whose prime factors are not in {2,3,5,7}, i.e., $m$ is coprime to $2\\\\times3\\\\times5\\\\times7=210$\\n- And $k \\\\leq 2940$\\n\\nSince $m$ must be coprime to 210, and $k = 2^a \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7 \\\\times m = 2^a \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7 \\\\times m$\\n\\nLet $k_0 = 2^a \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7$\\n\\nThen $k = k_0 \\\\times m$, with $\\\\gcd(m, 210) = 1$, and $k \\\\leq 2940$, so $m \\\\leq \\\\lfloor 2940 / k_0 \\\\rfloor$\\n\\nAnd $m \\\\geq 1$, integer.\\n\\nMoreover, since $m$ must be coprime to 210, we need to count the number of integers $m$ in $[1, M]$ coprime to 210, where $M = \\\\lfloor 2940 / k_0 \\\\rfloor$\\n\\nBut $m=1$ is allowed (no extra primes).\\n\\nSo for each valid $a$ and $c$, we compute $k_0 = 2^a \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7$, then $M = \\\\lfloor 2940 / k_0 \\\\rfloor$, then count $\\\\phi$-like sum, but actually the count of integers up to M coprime to 210.\\n\\nThe number of integers $\\\\leq M$ coprime to 210 is given by the inclusion-exclusion over the primes 2,3,5,7.\\n\\nSince 210 = 2×3×5×7, the totient function for the modulus, but it's the count $\\\\sum_{i=1}^M [\\\\gcd(i,210)=1]$\\n\\nThis can be computed as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{d|210} \\\\mu(d) \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{M}{d} \\\\right\\\\rfloor\\n$$\\n\\nWhere $\\\\mu$ is the Möbius function.\\n\\nSince 210 is small, we can list the divisors.\\n\\nDivisors of 210: 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14,15,21,30,35,42,70,105,210\\n\\n$\\\\mu(d)$: \\n- $\\\\mu(1)=1$\\n- $\\\\mu(p)=-1$ for prime p\\n- $\\\\mu(pq)=+1$ for distinct primes\\n- $\\\\mu(pqr)=-1$\\n- $\\\\mu(pqrs)=+1$ for four distinct primes\\n\\nSo:\\n- d=1: μ=1\\n- d=2,3,5,7: μ=-1\\n- d=6=2×3, 10=2×5, 14=2×7, 15=3×5, 21=3×7, 35=5×7: μ=+1\\n- d=30=2×3×5, 42=2×3×7, 70=2×5×7, 105=3×5×7: μ=-1\\n- d=210=2×3×5×7: μ=+1\\n\\nNow, for each combination of $a$ and $c$, we compute $k_0$, then $M = \\\\lfloor 2940 / k_0 \\\\rfloor$, then compute the sum.\\n\\nWe need to consider all $c \\\\geq 1$, but $k_0$ increases with $c$, so $M$ decreases.\\n\\nStart with smallest $k_0$.\\n\\nFirst, fix $a$ and vary $c$.\\n\\nCase 1: $a=0$\\n\\n$k_0 = 2^0 \\\\times 5^c \\\\times 7 = 7 \\\\times 5^c$\\n\\n$c \\\\geq 1$\\n\\n- $c=1$: $k_0 = 7 \\\\times 5 = 35$\\n  $M = \\\\lfloor 2940 / 35 \\\\rfloor = 84$\\n  Count number of $m \\\\leq 84$ with $\\\\gcd(m,210)=1$\\n\\n  Use inclusion-exclusion:\\n\\n  $\\\\sum_{d|210} \\\\mu(d) \\\\lfloor M/d \\\\rfloor$\\n\\n  Compute for M=84:\\n\\n  d=1: μ=1, floor(84/1)=84\\n  d=2: μ=-1, floor(84/2)=42\\n  d=3: μ=-1, floor(84/3)=28\\n  d=5: μ=-1, floor(84/5)=16\\n  d=7: μ=-1, floor(84/7)=12\\n  d=6: μ=1, floor(84/6)=14\\n  d=10: μ=1, floor(84/10)=8\\n  d=14: μ=1, floor(84/14)=6\\n  d=15: μ=1, floor(84/15)=5\\n  d=21: μ=1, floor(84/21)=4\\n  d=35: μ=1, floor(84/35)=2\\n  d=30: μ=-1, floor(84/30)=2\\n  d=42: μ=-1, floor(84/42)=2\\n  d=70: μ=-1, floor(84/70)=1\\n  d=105: μ=-1, floor(84/105)=0\\n  d=210: μ=1, floor(84/210)=0\\n\\n  Sum:\\n  = 84 \\n  -42 -28 -16 -12 \\n  +14 +8 +6 +5 +4 +2 \\n  -2 -2 -1 -0 \\n  +0\\n\\n  Calculate step by step:\\n  Positive: 84 +14+8+6+5+4+2 = 84+14=98, +8=106, +6=112, +5=117, +4=121, +2=123\\n  Negative: -42-28= -70, -16= -86, -12= -98, then -2-2-1= -5, total negative = -98 -5 = -103?

Max m is 83, which is prime, 35×83=2905<2940 — ok.\\n\\nNow, gcd(205800, 35k) = gcd(205800, 35×35m) = gcd(205800, 1225m)\\n\\nSince m coprime to 210, and 210 includes 2,3,5,7, so m coprime to 2,3,5,7, hence coprime to 1225=5^2×7^2? Not necessarily, but since m coprime to 5 and 7, yes, gcd(1225,m)=1\\n\\nSo gcd(205800, 1225m) = gcd(205800, 1225) since m coprime to 205800? 205800 has primes 2,3,5,7, m coprime to all, so yes, gcd is same as gcd(205800,1225)=1225, which is 35^2 — perfect square.\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nNow, for a=2, c=1: k_0=140, k=140m, m≤21, gcd(m,210)=1\\n\\nk=140m=2^2×5×7×m\\n\\nExponent of 2: 2 — good (a=2)\\nExponent of 3: 0 — good\\nExponent of 5: 1 ≥1 — good\\nExponent of 7: 1 — good\\n\\n35k=35×140m=4900m=2^2×5^2×7^2×m\\n\\ngcd with 205800=2^3×3×5^2×7^3: min exponents: 2^2, 5^2, 7^2, no 3 — so gcd=2^2×5^2×7^2=4900=70^2 — perfect square.\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nNow, total k values:\\n\\na=0:\\n- c=1: 20 values\\n- c=2: 3 values\\n- c=3: 1 value\\nSubtotal: 24\\n\\na=2:\\n- c=1: 5 values\\n- c=2: 1 value\\nSubtotal: 6\\n\\nTotal: 24+6=30\\n\\nBut is there overlap between these?\\n\\nFor example, is there a k that is counted in both a=0 and a=2?\\n\\nNo, because a is different: exponent of 2 is either 0 or 2, not both.\\n\\nWithin same a, different c give different k_0, and m≥1, so k different.\\n\\nCould k be same from different combinations? Unlikely, but let's see.\\n\\nFor example, k from a=0,c=1,m=1: k=35\\nFrom a=2,c=1,m=1: k=140 — different.\\n\\nOr k=35×11=385, k=140×1=140 — different.\\n\\nMinimum k in a=2 is 140, in a=0,c=1 is 35, but 35×4=140, but m=4, but gcd(4,210)=2≠1, so m=4 not allowed in a=0 case. Similarly, no overlap.\\n\\nSo total 30 distinct k.\\n\\nBut earlier I thought 5, but that was only m=1.\\n\\nNow, the problem is to find the number of possible values of k with k≤2940.\\n\\nSo answer should be 30.\\n\\nBut let me confirm the counts.\\n\\nFirst, a=0, c=1: k_0=35, M=84\\nNumber of m≤84 coprime to 210.\\nWe computed via inclusion-exclusion: 20\\nList: the numbers coprime to 210 up to 84.\\nSince φ(210)=φ(2)φ(3)φ(5)φ(7)=1×2×4×6=48, but that's density.\\nDensity is φ(210)/210=48/210=16/70=8/35≈0.2286\\n84×8/35= (84/35)×8=2.4×8=19.2, so around 19 or 20 — 20 is plausible.\\nWe calculated 20, and it matched inclusion-exclusion, so ok.\\n\\na=0,c=2: k_0=175, M=16\\nm≤16 coprime to 210: 1,11,13 — three, as listed.\\n\\na=0,c=3: k_0=875, M=3, m=1 only — one\\n\\na=2,c=1: k_0=140, M=21\\nm≤21 coprime to 210: 1,11,13,17,19 — five\\n\\na=2,c=2: k_0=700, M=4\\nm≤4: only m=1 — one\\n\\nTotal: 20+3+1+5+1=30\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nBut in a=2,c=2: k=700×1=700≤2940, yes.\\n\\nIs there any constraint that k must be such that 35k is integer? Already is.\\n\\nSo total 30 values.\\n\\nBut in the initial simple case, we had 5, but now 30.\\n\\nThe key was that k can have other prime factors as long as they don't introduce primes 2,3,5,7 with wrong exponents, but since we require specific exponents for 2,3,5,7, and other primes are free, but in this case, the other primes are in m, and m must not contain 2,3,5,7, so that the exponents remain exactly as specified.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo answer to Problem 2 is 30.\\n\\nBut let me double-check with a small example.\\n\\nSuppose k=35×11=385\\nThen 35k=35×385=13475? Earlier I said 35×35×11=1225×11=13475\\n205800 and 13475\\ngcd: since 13475=5^2×7^2×11, 205800=2^3×3×5^2×7^3, so gcd=5^2×7^2=1225, square — yes.\\nk=385≤2940 — yes.\\n\\nSimilarly, k=35×13=455, same thing.\\n\\nk=140×11=1540, 35k=35×1540=53900=2^2×5^2×7^2×11? 35×140×11=4900×11=53900\\ngcd with 205800: common 2^2,5^2,7^2 — gcd=4900=70^2 — yes.\\n\\nAll good.\\n\\nNow, is there a maximum c? We have c=3 for a=0, k_0=875, m=1, k=875\\nIf m>1, say m=11, k=875×11=9625>2940 — too big, so only m=1.\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nSo total 30.\\n\\nBut in the a=0,c=1 case, m can be up to 83, k=35×83=2905<2940, next m=89>84? M=84, but m≤84 and gcd(m,210)=1, m=83 is less than 84, m=89>84, not allowed.\\n\\nm=77? 77=7×11, gcd(77,210)=7≠1 — not allowed.\\nm=77 not coprime.\\n\\nm=1,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83 — that's 20, yes.\\n\\nSo final answers:\\nProblem 1: N=2900\\nProblem 2: 30\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"2900\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"30\"\n}",
