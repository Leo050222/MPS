We are to find k = h + 7, where h is the remainder when 100 is divided by the number of hours in a day (24). So compute 100 ÷ 24: 100 = 24×4 + 4, so the remainder h = 4. Then k = h + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11.\\n\\nProblem 2: We are given the numbers 2, 3, 4, 6. We need to choose three different numbers whose sum is 11. Try combinations:\\n- 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 → too small\\n- 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 → correct\\n- 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 → too big\\n- 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 → too big\\nOnly combination that sums to 11 is 2, 3, and 6. Their product is 2 × 3 × 6 = 36.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"11\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"36\"\n}",
