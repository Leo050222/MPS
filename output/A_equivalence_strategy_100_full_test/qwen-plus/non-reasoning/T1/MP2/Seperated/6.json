For a fixed sum, the product of two numbers is maximized when the numbers are as close as possible to each other. Since 31 is odd, the closest integers are 15 and 16. So let x = 15, y = 16 or vice versa. Then xy = 15 × 16 = 240. The largest possible value of xy is 240. Now, we are asked to find k = 240 - 231 = 9.\\n\\nProblem 2: We are given a line segment joining (-9, -2) and (6, 8). We need to count how many points on this segment have integer coordinates (lattice points).\\n\\nTo do this, we use the formula for the number of lattice points on a line segment between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2): it is gcd(|x2 - x1|, |y2 - y1|) + 1.\\n\\nCompute differences:\\nΔx = 6 - (-9) = 15\\nΔy = 8 - (-2) = 10\\n\\nNow compute gcd(15, 10) = 5\\nSo the number of lattice points is 5 + 1 = 6.\\n\\nTherefore, there are 6 points with integer coordinates on the line segment.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"9\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"6\"\n}",
