  "math_problem": "If \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers with \\( x>y \\) and \\( x+x y=391 \\), what is the value of \\( x+y \\)? Instead of finding the sum of the two positive integers satisfying the given equation and inequality, simply find \\( k = y + 14 \\), where \\( y \\) is the smaller positive integer in the pair that solves the equation under the stated conditions. There are \\( k \\) people in a room, 60% of whom are men. If no men enter or leave the room, how many women must enter the room so that 40% of the total number of people in the room are men?",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. Given:\n   \\[\n   x + x y = 391\n   \\]\n   with \\(x > y\\), and \\(x\\), \\(y\\) positive integers.\n\n2. Rewrite the equation:\n   \\[\n   x + x y = x (1 + y) = 391\n   \\]\n\n3. Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers, and \\(x (1+y) = 391\\), we need to find integer factors of 391.\n\n4. Factorize 391:\n   \\[\n   391 = 17 \\times 23\n   \\]\n\n5. Possible factor pairs:\n   \\[\n   (1, 391), (17, 23), (23, 17), (391, 1)\n   \\]\n\n6. Since \\(x(1+y) = 391\\), \\(x\\) must be one factor and \\(1 + y\\) the other.\n\n7. Let's test factor pairs:\n\n   - \\(x=1\\), \\(1+y=391 \\Rightarrow y=390\\) (But \\(x > y\\) does not hold, since \\(1 > 390\\) is false)\n   - \\(x=17\\), \\(1+y=23 \\Rightarrow y=22\\) (Does \\(x > y\\)? \\(17 > 22\\)? No)\n   - \\(x=23\\), \\(1+y=17 \\Rightarrow y=16\\) (Does \\(x > y\\)? \\(23 > 16\\)? Yes, valid)\n   - \\(x=391\\), \\(1+y=1 \\Rightarrow y=0\\) (y must be positive, invalid)\n\nSo the valid pair is \\(x=23\\), \\(y=16\\).\n\n8. Now, find \\(k = y + 14 = 16 + 14 = 30\\).\n\n---\n\n9. There are \\(k=30\\) people in a room, 60% of whom are men.\n\nNumber of men initially:\n\\[\n0.6 \\times 30 = 18\n\\]\nNumber of women initially:\n\\[\n30 - 18 = 12\n\\]\n\n10. Men do not change in the room. Let \\(w\\) be the number of women who enter so that men become 40% of the total.\n\nAfter \\(w\\) women enter, total people:\n\\[\n30 + w\n\\]\n\nNumber of men is still 18.\n\nCondition:\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{30 + w} = 0.4\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(w\\):\n\\[\n18 = 0.4 (30 + w)\n\\]\n\\[\n18 = 12 + 0.4 w\n\\]\n\\[\n18 - 12 = 0.4 w\n\\]\n\\[\n6 = 0.4 w\n\\]\n\\[\nw = \\frac{6}{0.4} = 15\n\\]\n\n---\n\nFinal conclusion: 15 women must enter.\n\nReturn the answer as specified.\n\n{  \n    \"answer\": \"15\"\n}",
