  "math_problem": "If $x$ and $y$ are positive integers with $x+y=31$, what is the largest possible value of $x y$? Instead of finding the largest possible value of the product $x y$, simply find $k$, which is that largest value minus 231. If a line segment joins the points $(-k,-2)$ and $(6,8)$, how many points on the line segment have coordinates that are both integers?",
  "reasoning_content": "{  \n    \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Find the largest possible value of xy given x + y = 31 with x and y positive integers.\\n- For fixed sum, the product xy is maximized when x and y are as close as possible.\\n- Since 31 is odd, the closest integers are 15 and 16.\\n- Calculate xy = 15 * 16 = 240.\\n\\nStep 2: Find k = largest value of xy - 231\\n- k = 240 - 231 = 9.\\n\\nStep 3: Consider the line segment joining points (-k, -2) and (6, 8), i.e., (-9, -2) and (6, 8).\\n\\nStep 4: Find the number of points on the line segment with integer coordinates.\\n- The slope of the line between (-9,-2) and (6,8): m = (8 - (-2)) / (6 - (-9)) = 10 / 15 = 2/3.\\n- The vector along the segment is (6 - (-9), 8 - (-2)) = (15, 10).\\n\\nStep 5: Points with integer coordinates between two integer points on a line segment correspond to lattice points on the segment, which are spaced evenly according to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of differences in coordinates.\\n- The number of lattice points on the line connecting two lattice points (including endpoints) is gcd(|Δx|, |Δy|) + 1.\\n- Here, Δx = 15, Δy = 10.\\n- gcd(15, 10) = 5.\\n\\nStep 6: Therefore, the number of lattice points on the segment is 5 + 1 = 6.\\n\\nFinal answer: 6\",\n    \"answer\": \"6\"\n}",
