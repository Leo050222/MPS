  "math_problem": "Solve for $2d$ if $10d + 8 = 528$. Instead of determining twice the solution to the linear equation, simply find the race distance $s$ equal to that solution plus 48. Megan and Hana raced their remote control cars for $s$ m. The two cars started at the same time. The average speed of Megan's car was $\\frac{5}{4} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Hana's car finished 5 seconds before Megan's car. What was the average speed of Hana's car?",
  "reasoning_content": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Solve for \\(d\\) from the equation:\n   \\[\n   10d + 8 = 528\n   \\]\n   Subtract 8 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   10d = 520\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 10:\n   \\[\n   d = 52\n   \\]\n\n2. The problem asks not for \\(2d\\), but for the race distance \\(s\\) which is the solution plus 48:\n   \\[\n   s = d + 48 = 52 + 48 = 100 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n3. Megan's average speed is \\(\\frac{5}{4} \\text{ m/s}\\).\n   Therefore, Megan's time to finish the race is:\n   \\[\n   t_M = \\frac{s}{v_M} = \\frac{100}{\\frac{5}{4}} = 100 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 80 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n4. Hana finished 5 seconds before Megan, so Hana's time is:\n   \\[\n   t_H = t_M - 5 = 80 - 5 = 75 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n5. Hana's average speed \\(v_H\\) is:\n   \\[\n   v_H = \\frac{s}{t_H} = \\frac{100}{75} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ m/s}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the average speed of Hana's car is \\(\\frac{4}{3} \\text{ m/s}\\).\n\n{\n    \"answer\": \"4/3\"\n}",
