It must be even. Possible exponents: 0,2.  \nmin(3, a) = 0 or 2\n\n- For 3: exponent is min(1, b). Must be even. Since the max is 1, possible exponents: 0. So exponent for 3 in gcd must be 0 → min(1,b)=0 → b=0\n\n- For 5: exponent is min(2, 1+c). Must be even.  \nPossible values for exponent: 0 or 2 (even numbers ≤ 2)  \nmin(2, 1 + c) = 0 or 2  ⇒ can 1 + c =0? No, since c≥0. So exponent cannot be 0.  \nSo exponent must be 2. So min(2, 1+c) = 2 ⇒ 1 + c ≥ 2 ⇒ c ≥ 1\n\n- For 7: exponent is min(3, 1+d). Must be even.  \nPossible even exponents: 0 or 2  \nCan min(3, 1+d) = 0? No, since 1+d ≥ 1 (as d≥0). So minimum exponent is at least 1. No exponent 0 possible here.  \nIs exponent=2 possible?  \nIf 1+d ≥ 2, min(3, 1+d) = 2 (good). So d ≥ 1.\n\nHence the constraints on k’s prime exponents:\n\n- a: min(3,a) = 0 or 2 → a=0 or a≥2 (since if a≥3 min=3 which is odd, invalid)  \nCheck a=0 → min(3,0)=0 even good  \na=1 → min(3,1)=1 odd no  \na=2 → min(3,2)=2 even good  \na≥3 → min(3,a)=3 odd no  \nSo a ∈ {0,2}\n\n- b = 0 (since min(1,b)=0 only if b=0)\n\n- c ≥ 1\n\n- d ≥ 1\n\nAlso, other primes in k can be anything, but these do not affect gcd with 205800 because 205800 doesn't have those primes, so exponent min is zero, which is even, so no restriction.\n\nTherefore,\n\nk = 2^a * 3^0 * 5^c * 7^d * (other primes to any power)\n\nwith:\n\n- a = 0 or 2\n\n- c ≥ 1\n\n- d ≥ 1\n\n- k ≤ 2940\n\nWe want to count the number of positive integers k ≤ 2940 that meet these prime factorization conditions.\n\nRewrite k = 2^a * 5^c * 7^d * q where q is square-free with primes other than 2,3,5,7 but from above q can be any positive integer coprime with 2,3,5,7. Since those primes do not affect gcd, q can be any positive integer coprime with 2,3,5,7.\n\nBut since q does not affect gcd, q is any positive integer coprime with 2,3,5,7, and the gcd exponents stay the same.\n\nThus, to maximize counting, we consider q=1 (to first understand constraints on the main part), then later multiply by the number of q satisfying q ≤ (2940 / (2^a * 5^c * 7^d)) and gcd(q, 2*3*5*7) =1.\n\nStrategy:\n\nEnumerate all tuples (a,c,d) with a=0 or 2, c≥1, d≥1 such that:\n\n2^a * 5^c * 7^d ≤ 2940\n\nFor each such triple, count positive integers q ≤ 2940 / (2^a * 5^c * 7^d) with gcd(q, 2*3*5*7) = 1.\n\nLet M = 2^a * 5^c * 7^d\n\nThe number of q ≤ floor(2940 / M) with gcd(q, 210) = 1 (since 2*3*5*7=210) is:\n\nNumber of positive integers ≤ N coprime with 210 = N * (1 - 1/2)(1 - 1/3)(1 - 1/5)(1 - 1/7) + error for integer counting  \n(φ(210)/210) * N where φ(210) = 210*(1 - 1/2)*(1 - 1/3)*(1 - 1/5)*(1 - 1/7)  \nCalculate φ(210):\n\nφ(210) = 210 * (1/2) * (2/3) * (4/5) * (6/7)  \n= 210 * 1/2 * 2/3 * 4/5 * 6/7  \nCalculate step by step:\n\n1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3  \n1/3 * 4/5 = 4/15  \n4/15 * 6/7 = (4*6)/(15*7) = 24 / 105 = 8 / 35\n\nSo,\n\nφ(210) = 210 * (8/35) = 210 * 8 / 35 = (210 / 35) * 8 = 6 * 8 = 48\n\nThus, φ(210) = 48\n\nSo the density of numbers coprime to 210 is 48/210 = 8/35.\n\nHence,\n\nCount of such q ≤ N = floor((8/35) * N) approximately.\n\nWe will sum over all (a,c,d) the value:\n\nCount_k for (a,c,d) = floor((8/35) * floor(2940 / (2^a * 5^c * 7^d)))\n\nNow we enumerate possible values for (a,c,d):\n\na ∈ {0,2}\n\nc ≥1, d ≥1\n\nSubject to: 2^a * 5^c * 7^d ≤ 2940\n\nStart with a=0 (2^0=1):\n\nWe want 5^c * 7^d ≤ 2940\n\nCompute possible c and d:\n\n5 powers:  \n5^1=5  \n5^2=25  \n5^3=125  \n5^4=625  \n5^5=3125 >2940 stop at 4\n\n7 powers:  \n7^1=7  \n7^2=49  \n7^3=343  \n7^4=2401  \n7^5=16807 too big\n\nTry combinations:\n\nFor c=1 (5), d=1 (7): 5*7=35 ≤ 2940 good  \nc=1, d=2: 5*49=245 good  \nc=1, d=3: 5*343=1715 good  \nc=1,d=4:5*2401=12005 >2940 no  \nc=1,d=4 no\n\nc=2 (25), d=1:25*7=175 good  \nc=2, d=2:25*49=1225 good  \nc=2,d=3:25*343=8575 >2940 no  \nc=3(125), d=1:125*7=875 good  \nc=3,d=2:125*49=6125 no  \nc=4(625), d=1:625*7=4375 no\n\nSo feasible (c,d) for a=0:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3),  \n(2,1), (2,2),  \n(3,1)\n\nNow a=2 (2^2=4):\n\nWe want 4 * 5^c * 7^d ≤ 2940\n\nSo 5^c * 7^d ≤ 2940 /4 = 735\n\nCheck combinations:\n\nc=1 (5), d=1(7):5*7=35 ≤735 good  \nc=1,d=2:5*49=245 good  \nc=1,d=3:5*343=1715 >735 no  \nc=2(25), d=1(7):175 ≤735 good  \nc=2,d=2:25*49=1225>735 no  \nc=3(125), d=1(7):875>735 no\n\nSo feasible c,d for a=2:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (2,1)\n\nSummary:\n\na=0: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1)\n\na=2: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)\n\nNow, for each triple, we compute:\n\nM = 2^a * 5^c * 7^d\n\nN = floor(2940 / M)\n\nNumber of q = floor( (8/35) * N )\n\nThen sum over these to get total possible k.\n\nNow do calculations:\n\n1) a=0, (1,1)  \nM=1 * 5^1 * 7^1=5*7=35  \nN = floor(2940 /35) = floor(84) = 84  \nq_count = floor(8/35*84) = floor( (8*84)/35 ) = floor(19.2) =19\n\n2) a=0, (1,2)  \nM=5 * 49=245  \nN=floor(2940/245)=floor(12)  \nq_count= floor(8/35*12) = floor(2.742857...) =2\n\n3) a=0, (1,3)  \nM=5 *343=1715  \nN=floor(2940/1715)=floor(1.713) =1  \nq_count= floor(8/35 *1)=floor(0.22857)=0\n\n4) a=0, (2,1)  \nM=25 * 7=175  \nN=floor(2940/175) = floor(16.8)=16  \nq_count= floor(8/35 *16) = floor(3.657) =3\n\n5) a=0, (2,2)  \nM=25 *49=1225  \nN=floor(2940/1225) = 2  \nq_count= floor(8/35 *2) = floor(0.457) =0\n\n6) a=0, (3,1)  \nM=125*7=875  \nN = floor(2940/875) = 3  \nq_count= floor(8/35 *3)= floor(0.685) =0\n\nNow for a=2:\n\n7) a=2, (1,1)  \nM=4 * 5 *7=140  \nN= floor(2940/140)=21  \nq_count= floor(8/35 *21)= floor(4.8)=4\n\n8) a=2, (1,2)  \nM=4 *5 *49=980  \nN= floor(2940/980) =3  \nq_count=floor(8/35 *3)=0\n\n9) a=2, (2,1)  \nM=4 * 25 *7=700  \nN=floor(2940/700)=4  \nq_count=floor(8/35 *4)=0\n\nSum all q_counts:  \n19 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 28\n\nBut wait, this counts all possible q that are coprime with 210.

Without that info, cannot compute the probability.\n\nSince the problem only gives central angles for 6 regions: four regions with central angle x°, and two with 20° and 140°, and found x=50°. It doesn't say which are shaded. Hence probability of stopping on a shaded region can't be determined.\n\nAssuming shaded regions are the four regions with central angle x°, then:\n\nSum of shaded angles = 4 * 50 = 200°\n\nTotal circle = 360°\n\nProbability = 200/360 = 5/9\n\nThis is a reasonable assumption.\n\n---\n\nFinal reasoning:\n\nProblem 1:  \nx = 50°  \nProbability if shaded are four regions of angle x: 4x/360 = 200/360 = 5/9\n\nProblem 2:  \nNumber of possible k = 28\n\n---\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The spinner has 6 regions with 4 regions each having central angle x degrees, and two with 20 and 140 degrees.
