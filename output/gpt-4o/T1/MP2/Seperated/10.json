Since the problem didn't provide answer choices in the user message, this might be an oversight.\n\n- Without given options, the best we can deduce is the set of possible \\( m \\) values must be a divisor of \\(-12\\), and it must be among the above integers.\n\n- If the question is to find which integer cannot be a value of \\( m \\) given the constant term \\(-12\\), any integer that is not a divisor of \\(\\pm12\\) cannot be a value of \\( m \\).\n\n- So if some integer is not a divisor of 12, it cannot be \\( m \\).\n\n- Since the user hasn't provided options, I will wait to infer that.\n\n- If the problem is asking to name such a value (for example, 5), 5 cannot be, since 12 is not divisible by 5.\n\nSince no options are provided, I cannot give a specific \"which cannot\" answer. Possibly a miscopy.\n\nGiven the instructions, I will provide answers only for Problem 1 and mention \"Insufficient information\" for Problem 2.\n\n---\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: The original price P satisfies 0.8P = 112, so P = 112 / 0.8 = 140. At 30% discount, the sale price is 0.7 * 140 = 98. Problem 2: The constant term in (x+m)(x+n) is mn = -12, where m and n are integers. The possible integer pairs for mn = -12 are factors of -12. Without given options, we cannot determine which integer value for m cannot be possible.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"98\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"Insufficient information\"\n}",
