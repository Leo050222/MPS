  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:\n\n- Let the number of skateboards be 7x and the number of bicycles be 4x, since the ratio is 7:4.\n\n- The problem states that there were 12 more skateboards than bicycles:\n  7x - 4x = 12\n  3x = 12\n  x = 4\n\n- Therefore, the number of skateboards = 7 * 4 = 28\n- The number of bicycles = 4 * 4 = 16\n- Total skateboards and bicycles = 28 + 16 = 44\n\nProblem 2:\n\n- Starting with:\n  Red candies = 10\n  Yellow candies = 7\n  Blue candies = 3\n\n- After eating candies, the numbers of each color must be equal.\n\n- Let the number of candies remaining be r.\n- We have:\n  r ≤ 10 (since we started with 10 red candies)\n  r ≤ 7 (yellow)\n  r ≤ 3 (blue)\n\n- So, the maximum possible equal number is 3 (as blue is the smallest starting quantity).\n\n- Number of candies eaten = (10 - r) + (7 - r) + (3 - r) = (10 + 7 + 3) - 3r = 20 - 3r\n\n- To minimize the number eaten, maximize r, so r = 3\n\n- Total candies eaten = 20 - 3 * 3 = 20 - 9 = 11\n\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let the number of skateboards be 7x and bicycles be 4x due to ratio 7:4. The difference is 12; thus, 3x = 12, so x = 4. Skateboards = 7*4 = 28, bicycles = 4*4 = 16, total = 44. Problem 2: Candies initially: red=10, yellow=7, blue=3. After eating, all equal r. Since blue=3 smallest, max r=3. Candies eaten = (10-3)+(7-3)+(3-3)=7+4+0=11. So smallest possible candies eaten is 11.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"44\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"11\"\n}",
