Since \\(2f(1)-1\\) and \\(2f(1)\\) are positive, \\(k\\) must be positive.\\n\\nRewrite:\\n\\n\\\\[ 2f(1) = k (2f(1) - 1) = 2k f(1) - k \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 2f(1) - 2k f(1) = -k \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 2f(1)(1 - k) = -k \\\\]\\n\\nMultiply both sides by \\(-1\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ 2f(1)(k - 1) = k. \\\\]\\n\\nBecause both sides are positive integers (since \\(f(1)\\ge1\\) and \\(k \\ge 1\\)), we look for integral solutions.\\n\\nTry \\(k = 1\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ 2f(1)(1 - 1) = 0 = 1 \\\\]\\nNo.\\n\\nTry \\(k = 2\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ 2f(1)(2 - 1) = 2f(1) = 2 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ f(1) = 1. \\\\]\\n\\nTry \\(k=3\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ 2f(1)(3 - 1) = 4 f(1) = 3 \\\\]\\nNot integer \\(f(1)\\).\\n\\nTry \\(k=4\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ 2 f(1) (4 -1) = 6 f(1) = 4 \\\\]\\nNot integer \\(f(1)\\).\\n\\nSo only \\(k=2\\) gives an integer \\(f(1)=1\\).\\n\\nHence,\\n\\n\\\\[ f(1) = 1. \\\\]\\n\\nTherefore,\\n\\n\\\\[ \\kappa = f(1) -1 = 1 -1 = 0. \\\\]\\n\\n--- Step 2: Analyze the sequence \\(F\\) with given conditions (a), (b), (c) ---\\n\\nThe problem defines a sequence \\\\(F(1), F(2), F(3), \\\\ldots\\\\) of non-negative integers, with three conditions:\\n\\n(a) Every integer \\\\( \\geq \\kappa \\\\) appears in the sequence.\\n\\nSince \\\\( \\kappa =0 \\\\), the sequence includes all integers \\\\( 0, 1, 2, 3, \\\\ldots \\\\).\\n\\n(b) For every positive integer \\\\( l \\\\) and every integer \\\\(M \\geq 0\\\\), there exists \\(n > M\\) such that \\(F(n) = l.\\)\\n\\nThis means every positive integer appears infinitely often in the sequence, and beyond any index \\(M\\), you can find it again.\\n\\n(c) For any \\(n \\geq 2\\),\\n\\n\\\\[ F(F(n^{163})) = F(F(n)) + F(F(361)). \\\\]\\n\\nThis is a functional equation on values of \\(F\\).\\n\\n--- Step 3: Verify existence of such sequence ---\\n\\nCondition (a) and (b) basically require the sequence to be surjective onto the nonnegative integers starting at 0, and every positive integer to appear infinitely often.\\n\\nCondition (c) is a functional equation involving iteration of \\(F\\). Let \\(a = F(F(361))\\) (a fixed value since \\(361\\) is fixed).\\n\\nRewrite (c) as:\\n\\n\\\\[ F(F(n^{163})) = F(F(n)) + a, \\quad \\forall n \\geq 2. \\\\]\\n\\nSuppose the sequence \\(F\\) is such that for some function \\(G = F \\circ F\\),\\n\\n\\\\[ G(n^{163}) = G(n) + a. \\\\]\\n\\nThink of this as:\\n\\n\\\\[ G(n^{163}) - G(n) = a. \\\\]\\n\\nFor this to hold for all \\(n\\geq 2\\), the function \\(G\\) must satisfy this equation.\\n\\nThis means \\(G\\) shows a constant increment \\(a\\) when passing from \\(n\\) to \\(n^{163}\\).\\n\\nNo explicit general construction is given here, but the problem only asks whether such a sequence \\(F\\) exists, given the previously found \\(\\kappa.\\)\\n\\nSince \\(\\kappa = 0\\) and the sequence is allowed to be any non-negative integers with the given properties, and the functional equation (c) can be seen as a linear relation on iterated values, it is plausible that such a sequence \\(F\\) does exist.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer in the problem is:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\kappa = 0, \\\\]\\n\\nand yes, such a sequence \\(F\\) exists.\\n\\n--- Final answers ---\\n\\n\\\\(\\\\kappa = 0\\\\) and existence affirmative.\\n\\nBut per the instruction, only the value of \\(\\kappa\\) is required as answer.\\n\\nHence,\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"answer\\\": \\\"0\\\"\\n}\\n\",\n  \"answer\": \"0\"\n}",
