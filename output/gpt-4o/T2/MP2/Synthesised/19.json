There are 21 competitors with distinct skill levels numbered $1,2, \\ldots, 21$. They participate in a pingpong tournament as follows. First, a random competitor is chosen to be \"active\", while the rest are \"inactive.\" Every round, a random inactive competitor is chosen to play against the current active one. The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. The tournament lasts for 20 rounds, after which there will only be one player remaining. Alice is the competitor with skill $k$. What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?",

the higher skill wins and becomes/is active; loser eliminated.\n- After 20 rounds, one winner remains.\n- Alice's skill \\(k = 11\\).\n\nQuestion: What is the expected number of games Alice plays?\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Understanding the tournament and expectation\n\nIn this tournament setup:\n\n- Players have distinct skill levels.\n- The active player keeps winning and stays active.\n- Each round eliminates one player.\n- The initial active player is randomly chosen (though the problem does not specify, but presumably).\n\nHowever, from the description, our focus is that Alice has skill \\(k=11\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Expected number of games Alice plays\n\nKnown from similar problems (also consistent with rank-based expectations in such elimination tournaments):\n\n- The number of games a player plays is equal to:\n\n> The number of players with skill less than or equal to Alice's skill that survived long enough to meet her.\n\n- The expected number of games Alice plays is the expected number of opponents she faces until she is eliminated or wins.\n\nBut more formally, in a tournament where higher skilled player always wins:\n\n- The expected number of games a player with skill \\(k\\) plays equals the harmonic number corresponding to her rank:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[G_k] = H_{21} - H_{21 - k}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(H_n = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{n}\\) is the harmonic number.\n\nThis formula applies for a variant of the King of the Hill elimination where opponents challenge the active player in random order.\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Calculate \\(H_{21} - H_{21-11} = H_{21} - H_{10}\\)\n\nWe need to calculate \\(H_{21} - H_{10} = \\sum_{n=11}^{21} \\frac{1}{n}\\).\n\nUse the exact fractions:\n\n\\[\nH_{21} = \\sum_{i=1}^{21} \\frac{1}{i}, \\quad H_{10} = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\frac{1}{i}\n\\]\n\nDifference:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=11}^{21} \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{11} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{13} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{21}\n\\]\n\nLet's add explicitly:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{11} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{13} + \\frac{1}{14} + \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{17} + \\frac{1}{18} + \\frac{1}{19} + \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{21}\n\\]\n\nCalculate step by step as rational fractions:\n\nExpress with common denominator? Or decimal approximations suffice since the problem requests exact value and the answer format is just the exact value.\n\nSince the problem does not specify decimals, and our answer \\(k=11\\) is exact, the expectation can be left like this or expressed as a fraction.\n\nBut likely, the problem expects a decimal or fraction.\n\nLet's compute the sum in decimals:\n\n- 1/11 ≈ 0.0909090909\n- 1/12 ≈ 0.0833333333\n- 1/13 ≈ 0.0769230769\n- 1/14 ≈ 0.0714285714\n- 1/15 ≈ 0.0666666667\n- 1/16 = 0.0625\n- 1/17 ≈ 0.0588235294\n- 1/18 ≈ 0.0555555556\n- 1/19 ≈ 0.0526315789\n- 1/20 = 0.05\n- 1/21 ≈ 0.0476190476\n\nAdd all up:\n\n0.0909090909  \n+0.0833333333 = 0.1742424242  \n+0.0769230769 = 0.2511655011  \n+0.0714285714 = 0.3225940725  \n+0.0666666667 = 0.3892607392  \n+0.0625 = 0.4517607392  \n+0.0588235294 = 0.5105842686  \n+0.0555555556 = 0.5661398242  \n+0.0526315789 = 0.6187714031  \n+0.05 = 0.6687714031  \n+0.0476190476 = 0.7163904507\n\nSo \\(\\approx 0.7163904507\\).\n\nIf a decimal approximation suffices, the expected number of games Alice plays is approximately \\(0.7163904507\\).\n\n---\n\nHowever, the stated skill levels are integers from 1 to 21, and the player skill is \\(k = 11\\).\n\nThis matches the median rank.\n\n---\n\n### Final answers:\n\n- \\(k = 11\\)\n- Alice's expected number of games = \\(H_{21} - H_{10}\\), exactly \\(\\sum_{n=11}^{21} \\frac{1}{n}\\)\n- Approximate this value or provide as is?\n\nSince the problem asks only to provide the final answer, and the question is:\n\n\"What is the expected number of games that she will get to play?\"\n\nGiven \\(k=11\\), the expected number of games Alice plays is \\(\\sum_{n=11}^{21} \\frac{1}{n}\\).\n\nLet's confirm the expected number by a known formula.\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning for the expected number of games played by Alice\n\nThe tournament process implies the expected number of games a player with skill \\(k\\) plays is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=k}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{j}\n\\]\n\nor equivalently,\n\n\\[\nH_N - H_{k-1}\n\\]\n\nBut from the initial known problem of this type, the expected number of games is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=k}^{N} \\frac{1}{i}\n\\]\n\nSince Alice's skill level is 11, and \\(N=21\\), the expected number of games is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=11}^{21} \\frac{1}{i}\n\\]\n\nWhich matches our earlier sum.\n\n---\n\nTherefore, the expected number of games played by Alice is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=11}^{21} \\frac{1}{i} = \\frac{1}{11} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{13} + \\frac{1}{14} + \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{17} + \\frac{1}{18} + \\frac{1}{19} + \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{21}\n\\]\n\nWe can express this as a decimal approximately 0.7163904507.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the results\n\n- \\(k = 11\\)\n- Expected number of games = \\(H_{21} - H_{10} \\approx 0.7163904507\\)\n\n---\n\n### According to the problem statement\n\nThe problem asks for the value of \\(k\\), which we found to be 11. Then it describes Alice as the competitor with skill \\(k\\), and asks for the expected number of games Alice gets to play.\n\nHence, the answer to be provided is the expected number of games.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n\"After completing your step-by-step reasoning, you MUST provide your final answer in JSON format with the answer value only.\"\n\nSo the answer is the expected number of games Alice plays.\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\n\nProviding the exact expected number in the simplified fraction form might be tedious due to varying denominators.\n\nHence, the expected number can be given either as a decimal with sufficient precision or as the sum of reciprocals.\n\nProviding the sum in the form of a simplified fraction would require finding a common denominator for all terms from 11 to 21, which is large.\n\nConsidering the instructions, providing the decimal is acceptable and more meaningful.\n\n---\n\n{  \n\"reasoning\": \"First, we solve the system:\\n\\nFrom the equations, by manipulation, we arrive at the quadratic equation for x: x^2 - 18x + 72 = 0 whose roots are x=6 and x=12.\\n\\nThe problem wants the solution associated with the smaller root for x +1, which corresponds to x=6.\\n\\nSubstituting x=6 back, we find y=27/5 and z=38/5.\\n\\nThen k = z + 17/5 = 38/5 + 17/5 = 11.\\n\\nNext, in a ping-pong tournament with 21 players with distinct skills 1 to 21, the expected number of games a player with skill k plays is the sum of the reciprocals from k to 21.\\n\\nTherefore, the expected number of games Alice (skill 11) plays is:\\n\\n1/11 + 1/12 + 1/13 + 1/14 + 1/15 + 1/16 + 1/17 + 1/18 + 1/19 + 1/20 + 1/21,\\n\\nwhich is approximately 0.7163904507.\",\n\"answer\": \"0.7163904507\"\n}",
