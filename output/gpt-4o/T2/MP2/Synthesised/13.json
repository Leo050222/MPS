  "math_problem": "The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to $k>0$, find $k$. Instead of determining the common numerical value shared by the perimeter and area, simply find $d = w + \\frac{37}{3}$, where $w$ is the width of the rectangle satisfying the given dimensional relation and equality condition. A ladder is leaning against a house with its lower end $d$ feet from the house. When the lower end is pulled 9 feet farther from the house, the upper end slides 13 feet down. How long is the ladder (in feet)?",
