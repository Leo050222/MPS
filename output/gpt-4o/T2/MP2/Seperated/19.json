The player with the higher skill will win and become (or remain) active, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament.

x - y\n\\]\n\nStep 2: Substitute \\(z\\) into the first two equations:\n\\[\nxy + (19 - x - y) = 40 \\implies xy - x - y = 21\n\\]\n\\[\nxz + y = 51\n\\]\nUsing \\(z=19 - x - y\\),\n\\[\nx(19 - x - y) + y = 51 \\implies 19x - x^2 - xy + y = 51\n\\]\n\nStep 3: Rearranged first equation:\n\\[\nxy - x - y = 21 \\implies xy - x - y + 1 = 22 \\implies (x - 1)(y - 1) = 22\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Rearranged second equation:\n\\[\n19x - x^2 - xy + y = 51 \\implies -x^2 + 19x + y - xy = 51\n\\]\nGroup terms with \\(y\\):\n\\[\ny(1 - x) + 19x - x^2 = 51\n\\]\n\nStep 5: From step 3:\n\\[\n(x-1)(y-1) = 22 \\implies y - 1 = \\frac{22}{x - 1} \\implies y = 1 + \\frac{22}{x - 1}\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Substitute \\(y\\) into the expression from step 4:\n\\[\ny(1 - x) + 19x - x^2 = 51\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\frac{22}{x - 1}\\right)(1 - x) + 19x - x^2 = 51\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\(\\left(1 + \\frac{22}{x -

1} = 1 + \\frac{22}{11} = 1 + 2 = 3\n\\]\nFrom \\(z = 19 - x - y\\):\n\\[\nz = 19 - 12 - 3 = 4\n\\]\n\nFor \\(x=6\\):\n\\[\ny = 1 + \\frac{22}{6 - 1} = 1 + \\frac{22}{5} = 1 + 4.4 = 5.4\n\\]\nFrom \\(z = 19 -
