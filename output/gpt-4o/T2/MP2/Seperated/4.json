  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:\n\nWe have a knockout tournament with 32 players, including Ava and Tiffany. Each round halves the number of players since each match eliminates one player.\n\nRounds: 5 (first round 32 -> 16 players, second 16 -> 8, third 8 -> 4, fourth 4 -> 2, fifth 2 -> 1 winner)\n\nWe want the probability that Ava and Tiffany meet at some point during the tournament.\n\nKey points:\n- Each round, surviving players are paired uniformly at random.\n- Matches are independent of previous matches except by elimination.\n- Both players have a 50% chance to win.\n\nOur problem reduces to finding the probability that Ava and Tiffany eventually play each other in any round.\n\nApproach:\n\n1. Initial Setup: 32 players, Ava and Tiffany start separate.\n\n2. Probability Denote \\(P_k\\) = probability they meet at round \\(k\\), \\(k=1\\) to 5 (round 1 is from 32 to 16, etc).\n\n3. Note that they can meet only if both are still in at round \\(k\\).\n\n4. They must not have met in earlier rounds.\n\nTo find the probability that they ever meet during the 5 rounds, compute the probability they meet in round 1, or if not then in round 2, etc, summing over rounds.\n\nRound \\(k\\), remaining players \\(N_k = 2^{5-k+1} =\\) \n\n- Round 1: 32 players\n\n- Round 2: 16 players\n\n- Round 3: 8 players\n\n- Round 4: 4 players\n\n- Round 5: 2 players\n\nAt each round, surviving players are paired uniformly at random.\n\n---\n\nWe can use the approach from the known problem \"probability that two given players meet in a knockout tournament where players paired at random in each round\":\n\nThe probability that two specific players meet in round \\(k\\) is:\n\n\\[P_k = P(\\text{both reach round }k) \\times \\text{probability of facing each other in round }k.\\]\n\n---\n\nStep 1: Probability both survive till round \\(k\\):\n\nBoth start in round 1.\n\nAt each previous round, each player has a 50% chance to win their match (independent), so\n\nProbability a given player survives \\(r\\) rounds: \\((\\frac{1}{2})^r\\).\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both survive up to round }k) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{k-1} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{k-1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2(k-1)} = 4^{-(k-1)}.\n\\]\n\nBecause at round \\(k\\), it means both have won \\(k-1\\) rounds.\n\n---\n\nStep 2: Probability that both face each other in round \\(k\\):\n\nAt round \\(k\\), there are \\(N_k = 32 / 2^{k-1} = 2^{6-k}\\) players.\n\nNumber of pairs: \\(N_k/2 = 2^{5-k}\\).\n\nPlayers are paired at random uniformly.\n\nGiven that Ava and Tiffany are both in round \\(k\\), what is the probability they get paired?\n\nChoosing pairs uniformly at random is equivalent to uniformly matching the \\(N_k\\) players into pairs.\n\nIn the random perfect matching, the probability that two fixed players form a pair is \\(\\frac{1}{N_k -1}\\).\n\nRationale:\n\nImagine one player is fixed (Ava). There are \\(N_k - 1\\) possible opponents. Since matching is random, the partner of Ava is uniformly distributed among the other \\(N_k -1\\) players.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Ava and Tiffany paired in round }k | \\text{both in round }k) = \\frac{1}{N_k -1} = \\frac{1}{2^{6-k} -1}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Combine:\n\n\\[\nP_k = P(\\text{both survive to round }k) \\times P(\\text{paired in round }k) = 4^{-(k-1)} \\times \\frac{1}{2^{6-k} -1}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nStep 4: Compute \\(P = \\sum_{k=1}^5 P_k\\):\n\nCompute for each \\(k\\):\n\n- \\(k=1:\\)\n\n\\[\nP_1 = 4^0 \\times \\frac{1}{2^{5} -1} = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{31} = \\frac{1}{31}.\n\\]\n\n- \\(k=2:\\)\n\n\\[\nP_2 = 4^{-1} \\times \\frac{1}{2^{4} -1} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{1}{60}.\n\\]\n\n- \\(k=3:\\)\n\n\\[\nP_3 = 4^{-2} \\times \\frac{1}{2^{3} -1} = \\frac{1}{16} \\times \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{1}{112}.\n\\]\n\n- \\(k=4:\\)\n\n\\[\nP_4 = 4^{-3} \\times \\frac{1}{2^{2} -1} = \\frac{1}{64} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{192}.\n\\]\n\n- \\(k=5:\\)\n\n\\[\nP_5 = 4^{-4} \\times \\frac{1}{2^{1} -1} = \\frac{1}{256} \\times \\frac{1}{1} = \\frac{1}{256}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nStep 5: Sum these up:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{31} + \\frac{1}{60} + \\frac{1}{112} + \\frac{1}{192} + \\frac{1}{256}.\n\\]\n\nFind a common denominator or sum carefully.\n\nFirst, find denominators:\n\n- 31\n\n- 60 = \\(2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5\\)\n\n- 112 = \\(2^4 \\cdot 7\\)\n\n- 192 = \\(2^6 \\cdot 3\\)\n\n- 256 = \\(2^8\\)\n\nWe look for the least common denominator (LCD).
