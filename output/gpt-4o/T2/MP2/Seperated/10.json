Every other number is equally likely when rolling.\n\nWe want the expected number of rolls to get all six numbers at least once.\n\nStep 1: Note the die's transition rules:\n\n- On first roll: any number 1-6 equally likely, so first roll picks a number.\n\n- For subsequent rolls: can't roll the number just rolled; the other 5 numbers are equally likely.\n\nThis is a variation of the coupon collector problem with a non-uniform dependency between consecutive rolls.\n\nStep 2: Model:\n\nStates: sets of collected numbers so far.\n\nWe track expected time \\(E(k)\\) to collect all 6 numbers when \\(k\\) distinct numbers have been collected.\n\nWe want \\(E(1)\\) because after first roll, we have exactly one number.\n\nStep 3: Transition probabilities:\n\nAfter rolling number in the collected set, the next number is picked from 5 numbers not equal to the last roll.\n\nOut of these, some may be new, some already collected.\n\nBut note: the number just rolled cannot appear again immediately.\n\nSo last roll impacts which numbers are possible next.\n\nTherefore, state must also consider the last number rolled and the collected set.\n\nThe full Markov chain is complex over states (collected_set, last_number).\n\nStep 4: Nonetheless, since the die cannot repeat the last number, the process reduces the chance of repeating the same number immediately.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nExpected time of collecting all 6 numbers under this constraint is known to be:\n\n\\[\nE = \\sum_{k=1}^6 \\frac{1}{p_k}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(p_k\\) is the probability of rolling a new number given that \\(k-1\\) unique numbers have been collected.\n\nStep 5: Calculate \\(p_k\\):\n\nAfter rolling a number, the next roll can be any number except the last rolled number.\n\nGiven \\(k-1\\) distinct numbers collected, there are \\(k-1\\) known numbers and \\(6-(k-1)=7-k\\) unknown numbers.\n\nSince last number cannot be repeated, the next number is one of 5 possible numbers (all except last rolled).\n\nAmong these 5, the count of new numbers is either \\(7-k\\) or \\(7-k-1\\) depending on whether the last rolled number was from collected or not.\n\nBut because the last rolled number is always in collected set (since rolling a new number adds it), it always belongs to collected set.\n\nThus, among the 5 possible next numbers, the count of new numbers is:\n\nNumber of new numbers not equal to last rolled number.\n\nSince last rolled number is in collected set, the collected set excluding last rolled number has size \\(k-2\\) (if \\(k>1\\)).\n\nBecause total numbers are 6, new numbers available:\n\n\\[\n= 6 - (k-1) = 7 - k\n\\]\n\nAmong 5 possible next numbers (excluding last rolled), the numbers break down as:\n\n- Among collected numbers: \\(k - 1\\) collected numbers total\n\n- Excluding last rolled: \\(k-2\\) collected numbers allowed next\n\n- So among next possible 5 numbers: \\(k-2\\) already collected numbers\n\n- Therefore, number of new numbers in next is:\n\n\\[\n5 - (k - 2) = 7 - k\n\\]\n\nStep 6: So probability to roll new number at stage \\(k\\) (i.e., have collected \\(k-1\\) numbers before the roll) is:\n\n\\[\np_k = \\frac{7 - k}{5}\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Expected time to get \\(k\\)th new number (going from \\(k-1\\) to \\(k\\) unique numbers) is the expected number of rolls to succeed with probability \\(p_k\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{p_k} = \\frac{5}{7 - k}\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Total expected rolls starting at 1 unique number collected (after first roll) is:\n\n\\[\nE = \\sum_{k=2}^6 \\frac{5}{7 - k}\n= 5 \\sum_{k=2}^6 \\frac{1}{7 - k}\n\\]\n\nMake substitution \\(j = 7 - k\\), as \\(k\\) goes from 2 to 6, \\(j\\) goes from 5 down to 1.\n\nSo sum becomes:\n\n\\[\n5 \\sum_{j=1}^5 \\frac{1}{j} = 5 \\times H_5\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(H_5\\) is the 5th harmonic number:\n\n\\[\nH_5 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{137}{60} \\quad \\text{(exact fraction)}\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Total expected rolls counting the first roll (which is guaranteed to yield first unique number):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = 1 + 5 \\times H_5 = 1 + 5 \\times \\frac{137}{60} = 1 + \\frac{685}{60} = \\frac{60}{60} + \\frac{685}{60} = \\frac{745}{60} = \\frac{149}{12}\n\\]\n\nSo the expected number of rolls is \\(\\frac{149}{12}\\).\n\n---\n\nFinal answers:\n\nProblem 1: \\(a/b = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nProblem 2: \\(\\frac{149}{12}\\)\n\n---\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Let a + sqrt(b) = sqrt(15 + sqrt(216)) with integers a, b. Squaring both sides gives a^2 + b + 2a sqrt(b) = 15 + sqrt(216). Equate rational parts: a^2 + b = 15, and irrational parts: 2a sqrt(b) = sqrt(216) = 6 sqrt(6). From irrational parts, a sqrt(b) = 3 sqrt(6). Since a and b are integers, sqrt(b) = sqrt(6), so b = 6 and a = 3. Check a^2 + b = 9 + 6 = 15 correct. Then a/b = 3/6 = 1/2.\\n\\nProblem 2: Mark has a cursed 6-sided die that can’t roll the same number twice in a row. To find expected rolls to get all numbers, model as coupon collector with dependency disallowing repeating last number. Probability of getting a new number when k-1 numbers known is (7 - k)/5 because next roll is uniform over 5 numbers excluding last rolled. Expected number of rolls to get kth new number is inverse: 5/(7 - k). Summing from k=2 to 6 and adding first roll (which yields first unique number) gives total expectation: 1 + 5 * (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5) = 1 + 5 * (137/60) = 149/12.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"1/2\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"149/12\"\n}",
