Find the two prime numbers \\(p\\) that satisfy this.\n\nStep 1: Write the equation:\n\\[5p = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^{2}}{5} \\right\\rfloor\\]\n\nThis means:\n\\[\n5p \\leq \\frac{n^2}{5} < 5p + 1\n\\]\n\nMultiply all parts by 5 to clear the denominator:\n\\[\n25p \\leq n^2 < 25p + 5\n\\]\n\nSo \\(n^2\\) is an integer between \\(25p\\) and \\(25p + 4\\) inclusive.\n\nStep 2: For each prime \\(p\\), check if there exists an integer \\(n\\) such that:\n\\[\nn^2 \\in [25p, 25p + 4]\n\\]\n\nThe integers \\(n\\) will be close to \\(5\\sqrt{p}\\), because \\(n \\approx 5 \\sqrt{p}\\).\n\nWe need to find primes \\(p\\) such that the interval \\([25p, 25p + 4]\\) contains a perfect square.\n\nStep 3: We'll test primes \\(p\\) for which \\(n^2\\) could lie in this interval.\n\nCheck \\(p=2\\):\nInterval: [50, 54]\nSquares around: 7²=49, 8²=64, no square inside [50, 54]\n\nNo.\n\n\\(p=3\\):\nInterval: [75, 79]\n8²=64, 9²=81\nNo perfect square in [75,79]\n\nNo.\n\n\\(p=5\\):\nInterval: [125, 129]\n11²=121, 12²=144\nNo.\n\n\\(p=7\\):\nInterval: [175, 179]\n13²=169, 14²=196\nNo.\n\n\\(p=11\\):\nInterval: [275, 279]\n16²=256, 17²=289\nNo.\n\n\\(p=13\\):\nInterval: [325, 329]\n18²=324, 19²=361\nNo.\n\n\\(p=17\\):\nInterval: [425, 429]\n20²=400, 21²=441\nNo.\n\n\\(p=19\\):\nInterval: [475, 479]\n21²=441, 22²=484\n484>479, no.\n\n\\(p=23\\):\nInterval: [575, 579]\n23²=529, 24²=576\n576 in [575,579] → yes\n\nThus \\(n=24\\), \\(n^2=576\\) is in interval.\n\nSo one prime is \\(p=23\\).\n\nCheck \\(p=29\\):\nInterval: [725, 729]\n26²=676, 27²=729\n729 in interval.\n\nSo \\(p=29\\) is another prime.\n\nStep 4: Verify the solution:\n\nFor \\(p=23\\):\nCheck:\n\\[\n5p = 5 \\times 23 = 115\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{576}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 115.2 \\right\\rfloor = 115\n\\]\n\nYes, matches 115.\n\nFor \\(p=29\\):\n\\[\n5p = 5 \\times 29 = 145\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{729}{5}\\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 145.8 \\right\\rfloor = 145\n\\]\n\nAlso matches.\n\nStep 5: Sum of the two primes is:\n23 + 29 = 52\n\n---\n\nFinal answers:\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: Victoria wants at least 550 donuts, ordered in multiples of 12.

Problem 2: We want primes p such that 5p = floor(n^2/5) for some positive integer n. This is equivalent to n^2 in [25p, 25p+4].
