Perimeter P = 8w and area A = 3w^2. Given P = A = k, so 8w = 3w^2. Solving 8w = 3w^2 for w > 0 gives w = 8/3. Then k = 8w = 64/3.\\nProblem 2: Let the ladder length be L, height h initially, and horizontal distance 15 ft. Then L^2 = 225 + h^2. After moving the base 9 ft farther (24 ft total), the top slides down 13 ft, so new height is h - 13, new equation L^2 = 576 + (h - 13)^2. Equate: 225 + h^2 = 576 + h^2 - 26h + 169, simplifying to 20 = h. Substitute h back to get L^2 = 225 + 400 = 625, so L = 25.\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"64/3\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"25\"\n}",
