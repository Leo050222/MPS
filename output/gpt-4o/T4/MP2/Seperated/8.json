  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:\nWe want to find all functions \\( f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) such that for all real \\(x, y\\),\n\\[\nf(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = x^2 f(x) + y^2 f(y) + f(xy).\n\\]\n\nStep 1: Plug in \\( y = 0 \\):\n\\[\nf(x^3 + 0 + 0) = x^2 f(x) + 0 + f(0).\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\nf(x^3) = x^2 f(x) + f(0).\n\\]\n\nStep 2: Define \\(c = f(0)\\). Then:\n\\[\nf(x^3) - x^2 f(x) = c.\n\\]\n\nStep 3: Try to find the form of \\(f\\).\n\nLet's test \\(x=1\\):\n\\[\nf(1^3) = 1^2 f(1) + c \\implies f(1) = f(1) + c \\implies c=0.\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[\nf(x^3) = x^2 f(x).\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Use this in the original equation:\n\\[\nf(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = x^2 f(x) + y^2 f(y) + f(xy).\n\\]\n\nRewrite using the result from Step 3.\n\nSince \\(f(x^3) = x^2 f(x)\\), we can write \\(x^2 f(x) = f(x^3)\\) and similarly for \\(y\\). So,\n\\[\nf(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = f(x^3) + f(y^3) + f(xy).\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Consider \\(z = xy\\). So the equation is:\n\\[\nf(x^3 + y^3 + z) = f(x^3) + f(y^3) + f(z).\n\\]\n\nStep 6: Since this must hold for all real \\(x, y\\), and \\(z = xy\\) can be any real number (since \\(x, y\\) are arbitrary), let's define a function \\(g\\):\nDefine \\(g(t) = f(t)\\) for any real \\(t\\).\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\\[\ng(a + b + c) = g(a) + g(b) + g(c)\n\\]\nfor all \\(a,b,c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are cubes, and \\(c\\) is any real number.\n\nObserve that sums of cubes are dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the functional equation extends to:\n\\[\ng(r + s + t) = g(r) + g(s) + g(t)\n\\]\nfor all real \\(r, s, t\\).\n\nFix \\(t=0\\):\n\\[\ng(r + s) = g(r) + g(s) + g(0).\n\\]\n\nSet \\(s=0\\):\n\\[\ng(r) = g(r) + g(0) + g(0) \\implies g(0) = 0.\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\\[\ng(r + s) = g(r) + g(s).\n\\]\n\nSo \\(g:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) is additive.\n\nStep 7: Since \\(f(x^3) = x^2 f(x)\\), and \\(g=f\\) is additive, try to relate \\(f\\) to standard function forms.\n\nStep 8: Try \\(f(x) = k x\\) linear.\n\nCheck:\n\\[\nf(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = k(x^3 + y^3 + xy),\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nx^2 f(x) + y^2 f(y) + f(xy) = x^2 (k x) + y^2 (k y) + k (x y) = k(x^3 + y^3 + x y).\n\\]\n\nThese are equal, so all linear functions \\(f(x) = k x\\) satisfy the equation.\n\nStep 9: Try \\(f(x) = k x^m\\) for some \\(m\\).\n\nWe check:\n\n\\[\nf(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = k (x^3 + y^3 + x y)^m,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nx^2 f(x) + y^2 f(y) + f(xy) = k x^{2+m} + k y^{2+m} + k (xy)^m.\n\\]\n\nUnless \\(m=1\\), it is not likely to hold for all \\(x,y\\).\n\nStep 10: Try the zero function \\(f(x)=0\\). Then both sides are zero. So zero function is a solution.\n\nStep 11: Verify no other solutions.\n\nWe have established that \\(f\\) must be additive and satisfy \\(f(x^3) = x^2 f(x)\\).\n\nTest if \\(f\\) is additive and linear:\n\nAssuming \\(f\\) is additive and continuous (to avoid pathologies), then \\(f(x) = k x\\).\n\nSubstitute:\n\\[\nf(x^3) = k x^3,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nx^2 f(x) = x^2 \\cdot k x = k x^3,\n\\]\ncheck out.\n\nTherefore, solutions are exactly \\(f(x) = k x\\) for some constant \\(k\\).\n\nProblem 1 final answer:\n\\[\nf(x) = c x, \\text{ where } c \\in \\mathbb{R}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nProblem 2:\nFind a sequence of maximal length consisting of non-zero integers in which the sum of any 7 consecutive terms is positive and the sum of any 11 consecutive terms is negative.\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem.\n\nWe seek a finite sequence \\( (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) \\) of non-zero integers with maximal length \\(n\\) such that for every consecutive block of length 7: sum positive, and for every consecutive block of length 11: sum negative.\n\nStep 2: Let \\(n\\) be the length of the sequence.\n\nBecause sums of consecutive 7 terms are positive and sums of consecutive 11 terms are negative, these constraints are contradictory over large \\(n\\).\n\nStep 3: Observe that for \\(n < 11\\), no block of length 11 exists, so the negative sum condition doesn't apply. We want maximal \\(n\\), so \\(n \\geq 11\\).\n\nStep 4: For \\(n \\geq 11\\), the sums of 7 consecutive terms are positive, and sums of 11 consecutive terms are negative.\n\nStep 5: Consider generating function-like or average arguments.\n\nIf sums of any 7 consecutive are > 0, average over these blocks is positive.\n\nIf sums of any 11 consecutive terms are < 0, average over these blocks is negative.\n\nThis contradicts the idea of the average over the total sequence when \\(n\\) is large.\n\nStep 6: Try a periodic construction.\n\nLet’s try period \\(p\\) and repeat it \\(k\\) times plus a possible remainder.\n\nWe want to find \\(p\\) minimal sequence of length \\(p\\) which satisfies:\n\n- sum of any 7 consecutive terms in the periodic sequence > 0,\n- sum of any 11 consecutive terms in the periodic sequence < 0.\n\nSince the sequence is periodic, the sums are cyclical with period \\(p\\).\n\nStep 7: Break down the problem.\n\nThe minimal period must be at least the least common multiple of 7 and 11, which is 77, but maybe a smaller period can be found.\n\nStep 8: Consider \\(a_i = 1\\) for first \\(7\\) terms and \\(-1\\) for next \\(4\\) terms in a 11-term repeating sequence.\n\nSequence: +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, -1, -1, -1, -1\n\nSum of 7 consecutive terms started anywhere in period:\n\n1) From position 1 to 7: sum = 7 > 0 good.\n\n2) From position 2 to 8: sum = 6 (six 1's and one -1) = 6 > 0 good.\n\n3) From position 5 to 11:\n\nPositions 5-7: ones = 3, positions 8-11: -1's =4 total sum = 3 - 4 = -1 <0 not good. Need sum > 0 for any 7 consecutive terms.\n\nSo this simple pattern fails.\n\nStep 9: Try a sequence of length 17 or 18 combining +1 and -1 to satisfy conditions.\n\nTrial and error will be tedious.\n\nStep 10: Alternate approach.\n\nIf the sum of any 7 consecutive terms is positive and sum of any 11 consecutive terms is negative, then average of any 7 consecutive terms > 0, average of any 11 consecutive terms < 0.\n\nLet \\(s_i = a_i\\). Consider sums:\n\nFor the 7-length blocks: \\(S_7(i) = \\sum_{j=i}^{i+6} s_j > 0\\).\n\nFor the 11-length blocks: \\(S_{11}(i) = \\sum_{j=i}^{i+10} s_j < 0\\).\n\nStep 11: Consider the sum over 18 terms.\n\nSum these inequalities over \\(i=1\\) to \\(i=n - 10\\):\n\nUse summation technique:\n\nSum of all \\( S_7(i) \\) over \\(i=1\\) to \\(i = n - 6\\): each term \\(s_j\\) is counted exactly 7 times because every term belongs to exactly 7 such blocks.\n\nSum of all \\( S_7(i) > 0 \\Rightarrow \\sum_{i=1}^{n-6} S_7(i) > 0 \\)\n\nNumber of 7-block sums is \\(n - 6\\), each contains 7 terms.\n\nSum over \\(i\\),\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n-6} S_7(i) = 7 \\sum_{j=1}^n s_j.\n\\]\nSimilarly,\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n-10} S_{11}(i) = 11 \\sum_{j=1}^n s_j.\n\\]\n\nBut \\(S_7(i) > 0\\) for all \\(i\\), so \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{n-6} S_7(i) > 0 \\Rightarrow 7 \\sum_{j=1}^n s_j > 0.\\)\n\nSimilarly, \\(S_{11}(i) < 0\\) for all \\(i\\), so\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n-10} S_{11}(i) < 0 \\Rightarrow 11 \\sum_{j=1}^n s_j < 0.\n\\]\n\nTogether,\n\\[\n7 \\sum s_j >0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 11 \\sum s_j < 0,\n\\]\ncontradiction unless \\(\\sum s_j = 0\\) which is impossible.\n\nThus, no sequence of length \\(n \\geq 18\\) exists.\n\nStep 12: But for \\(n=17\\):\nNumber of 7-blocks: 11 (positions 1 through 11)\nNumber of 11-blocks: 7 (positions 1 through 7)\n\nSimilarly,\n\\[\n7 \\sum s_j > 0, \\quad 11 \\sum s_j < 0,\n\\]\nimpossible again.\n\nStep 13: For \\(n=17\\), no sequence exists.\n\nFor \\(n=17\\), no sequence.\n\nTry \\(n=17-1=16\\):\n\nNumber of 7-blocks: 10,\nNumber of 11-blocks: 6,\n\nSum over 7-blocks:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{10} S_7(i) = 7 \\sum s_j > 0,\n\\]\nSum over 11-blocks:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{6} S_{11}(i) = 11 \\sum s_j < 0,\n\\]\ncontradiction.\n\nFor all \\( n \\geq 11 \\), contradiction.\n\nStep 14: For sequences \\(n < 11\\), sums of 11-terms do not apply.\n\nTherefore, maximal length sequence is one with length less than 11.\n\nStep 15: For length \\(n=10\\):\n\nThe sum over all 7-blocks:\nThere are \\(10 - 7 + 1 = 4\\) blocks.\n\nSum over 7-blocks:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^4 S_7(i) = 7 \\sum s_j > 0,\n\\]\nsince each term appears in exactly 7 blocks? Check carefully:\n\nNo, each term's count over 7-block sums depends on position:\n\nPositions:\n\n- positions 1 to 4 appear in 1 block each,\n- middle terms positions 7 and so on appear in 7 blocks.\n\nBetter to check language in known result: position 4 to 7 appear in more than one 7-block.\n\nBut for short sequences, counts vary.\n\nAlternate try: it's easier to test by example.\n\nStep 16: Construct sequence of length 10 satisfying sum of any 7 consecutive positive.\n\n7-consecutive sums: block 1= positions 1-7, block 2=2-8, block 3=3-9, block 4=4-10.\n\nWe want sums positive.\n\nSince no 11-block sums, sum of any 11 consecutive terms < 0 has no meaning.\n\nTherefore \\(n=10\\) is feasible.\n\nStep 17: Construct such sequence and check.\n\nTry all 1’s: sums of any 7 consecutive are 7>0. But 11-block sum condition is vacuously true.\n\nAll terms non-zero integers. So sequence length can be 10.\n\nStep 18: For \\(n=11\\), the contradiction arises from the sum condition.\n\nTherefore, the maximal length is 10.\n\nStep 19: Final answer to Problem 2:\n\nMaximal length is 10.\n\nFor instance, sequence of all ones: (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1).\n\nSums of any 7 consecutive terms: 7 > 0.\n\nNo 11-block to check (length 11 needed).\n\nStep 20: To confirm, can we find sequence length 11?\n\nTry length 11 all ones:\n\nSum of any 7 terms =7>0 okay\n\nSum of any 11 terms = sum of entire sequence = 11>0 contradicts the need for negative sum.\n\nTherefore, no length 11 sequence.\n\nHence maximal length is 10.\n\n---\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We analyze the functional equation f(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = x^2 f(x) + y^2 f(y) + f(xy).\\nSetting y=0, we get f(x^3) = x^2 f(x) + f(0). Evaluating at x=1 gives f(0)=0.\\nThe original equation can be rewritten as f(x^3 + y^3 + xy) = f(x^3) + f(y^3) + f(xy), which implies f is additive.\\nTesting linear functions f(x) = kx satisfies the equation, and zero also satisfies it.\\nNo other forms satisfy the cubic identity and additivity together, assuming continuity or regularity.\\nThus, all solutions are linear: f(x) = c x.\\n\\nProblem 2: We want maximal length sequence of non-zero integers where sum of any 7 consecutive terms > 0 and sum of any 11 consecutive terms < 0.\\nSummation over all 7-blocks and all 11-blocks yields a contradiction for any length n >= 11.\\nHence, no such sequences of length >= 11 exist.\\nLength less than 11 is possible; length 10 sequences (e.g., all ones) satisfy the 7-consecutive positive sum condition and do not violate the 11-consecutive condition (no such blocks).\\nTherefore, maximal length is 10.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"c x where c is any real number\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"10\"\n}",
