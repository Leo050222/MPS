      "A3384": "One day, there is a Street Art Show at somewhere, and there are some spectators around. We consider this place as an Euclidean plane. Let $K$ be the center of the show. And name the spectators by $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}, \\ldots$ They pick their positions $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}, \\ldots$ one by one. The positions need to satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously. (i) The distance between $K$ and $A_{n}$ is no less than 10 meters, that is, $K P_{n} \\geq 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any positive integer $n$. (ii) The distance between $A_{n}$ and any previous spectator is no less than 1 meter, that is, $P_{m} P_{n} \\geq 1 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any $n \\geq 2$ and any $1 \\leq m \\leq n-1$. (iii) $A_{n}$ always choose the position closest to $K$ that satisfies (i) and (ii), that is, $K P_{n}$ reaches its minimum possible value. If there are more than one point that satisfy (i) and (ii) and have the minimum distance to $K, A_{n}$ may choose any one of them. For example, $A_{1}$ is not restricted by (ii), so he may choose any point on the circle $C$ which is centered at $K$ with radius 10 meters. For $A_{2}$, since there are lots of points on $C$ which are at least 1 meter apart from $P_{1}$, he may choose anyone of them. (1) Which of the following statement is true? (A) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2}$ always hold (unit: meter); (B) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} \\sqrt{n} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} \\sqrt{n}$ always hold (unit: meter); (C) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n$ always hold (unit: meter); (D) There exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that for any positive integer $n$, no matter how $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ choose their positions, $c_{1} n^{2} \\leq K P_{n} \\leq c_{2} n^{2}$ always hold (unit: meter)."

Check if this implies f_n(4) = 2*4=8 for all n.\\nFrom recursion:\\n    f_2(4) = sqrt(16 + 6*8) = sqrt(16 + 48) = sqrt(64) = 8\\nSimilarly, f_3(4) = sqrt(16 + 6*8) = 8, and so on.\\nHence, for all n, f_n(4) = 8 = 2*4.\\n\\nStep 5: Is x=4 the only solution for any n?\\n- For n=1, only x=4.\\n- For n=2, candidates were x=0 and x=4. But x=0 fails at n=1.\\n- By induction and recursion shape, only x=4 satisfies f_n(x)=2x for all n.\\n\\nTherefore, for each positive integer n, the only real solution to f_n(x) = 2x is x=4.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nProblem 2:\\nWe have an infinite sequence of spectators A_1, A_2, ..., A_n choosing points P_1, P_2, ..., P_n in the plane with center K.\\nConditions:\\n(i) Distance from K to P_n >= 10\\n(ii) Distance between P_n and any previous P_m >= 1\\n(iii) At each step, A_n chooses a point closest to K satisfying (i) and (ii)\\n\\nThe question is which of (A), (B), (C), or (D) holds:\\n(A) There exist positive constants c1,c2 such that for all n:\\nc1 <= KP_n <= c2 (distance bounded independent of n)\\n(B) There exist positive constants c1,c2 such that for all n:\\nc1*sqrt(n) <= KP_n <= c2*sqrt(n)\\n(C) There exist positive constants c1,c2 such that for all n:\\nc1*n <= KP_n <= c2*n\\n(D) There exist positive constants c1,c2 such that for all n:\\nc1*n^2 <= KP_n <= c2*n^2\\n\\nReasoning:\\n- The spectators must be at least 1 meter apart from each other.\\n- Each wants to stand as close to K as possible, and at least 10 m from K.\\n- The first spectator stands somewhere on the circle with radius 10.\\n- Each new spectator must be at least 1 m from all previous ones.\\n- Since points can't be closer together than 1, the number of points that can fit inside a circle of radius R is roughly proportional to the area: ~ π R^2.\\n\\nWe want to estimate how large KP_n can become as number of spectators n increases.\\n\\nUpper bound:\\n- If spectators fill the ring between radius 10 and radius R (for some R large), the number of spectators that can fit with minimal 1 m spacing is approximately proportional to area difference:\\n  π (R^2 - 10^2) ≈ n,\\nso R^2 ~ n + 100 (for large n, ignore 100): R ~ sqrt(n)\\n\\nLower bound:\\n- Because A_n picks the closest possible point to K subject to constraints, the nth spectator cannot stand closer than some distance that grows with order sqrt(n), because more points can't be packed inside smaller radius without violating distance ≥1.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimal radius grows proportionally to sqrt(n).\\n\\nHence, the correct option is (B): There exist positive real numbers c1, c2 such that c1 sqrt(n) ≤ KP_n ≤ c2 sqrt(n) always holds.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nFinal answers:\\nProblem 1 answer: x = 4\\nProblem 2 answer: (B)\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"4\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"(B)\"\n}",
