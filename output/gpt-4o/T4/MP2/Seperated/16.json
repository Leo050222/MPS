Circles are drawn through every 4 possible concyclic points.\n\nFind the maximum number of circles that can be drawn.\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem.\n\nWe have 7 points arbitrarily placed. Circles are drawn through every set of 4 points that are concyclic (lie on the same circle).\n\nWe want the maximum number of such circles.\n\nStep 2: Condition: Each circle passes through exactly 4 points.\n\nIf there are more than 4 concyclic points, for example 5 or more on a circle, then by the problem statement \"every 4 possible concyclic points\" implies circles passing through 4 points (the subset of the points) are drawn.\n\nStep 3: Degenerate configurations may increase the number of such circles.\n\nStep 4: Since the problem is about maximum number of circles, consider the scenario where every subset of 4 points forms a concyclic quadruple.\n\nQuestion: Is it possible for 7 points such that every 4 points are concyclic?\n\nUnlikely, because 5 points define a unique circle if they are concyclic; otherwise not.\n\nStep 5: The maximum number of circles corresponds to the number of 4-point concyclic subsets of points.\n\nStep 6: Since the points are arbitrary, the maximum number of 4-point concyclic sets is the number of 4-element subsets of 7 points:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{4} = 35.\n\\]\n\nStep 7: But if every subset of 4 points defines a circle, and all points are on general position (no three colinear, no four concyclic), then no 4 points lie on the same circle, so no 4-point concyclic sets.\n\nBut the problem wants the maximum.\n\nStep 8: Another approach is counting the maximum number of distinct circles that can be drawn passing through exactly 4 points.\n\nIf we can arrange 7 points such that every circle passes through exactly 4 points, and each circle is counted once.\n\nStep 9: Check if it's possible that each distinct circle corresponds to 4 points; if more points are concyclic on the same circle, then it counts as multiple quadruples.\n\nStep 10: We want to maximize the number of circles with 4 points on them.\n\nMax circles of 4 points from 7 points is the number of 4-point subsets:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{4} = 35,\n\\]\n\nbut these subsets may overlap on the same circle, so the number of distinct circles could be less than 35.\n\nStep 11: To maximize the number of circles, and because any circle through 3 non-collinear points is unique, a circle can be determined by 3 points.\n\nIf 4 or more points lie on the same circle, then the number of 4-point subsets on this circle is more than one, but they correspond to the same circle.\n\nStep 12: The minimal number of distinct circles occurs when many quadruples lie on the same circle; the maximum number of circles occurs when quadruples of 4 points are on distinct circles.\n\nStep 13: But for a set of 7 points, the maximum number of circles passing through exactly 4 points is limited.\n\nStep 14: Each circle is determined by 3 points, but the problem is about 4 point concyclicity.\n\nStep 15: Counting how many 4-point subsets are concyclic and can produce distinct circles: maximum number of distinct circles is less or equal to the total number of 3-point subsets:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{3} = 35.\n\\]\n\nBecause 3 points determine a circle.\n\nBut we want circles passing through 4 points.\n\nStep 16: To have a circle passing through 4 points, the 4 points must be on the same circle determined by 3 of them.\n\nFor each circle with 4 points, there are \\(\\binom{4}{3} =4\\) triplets of points that determine it.\n\nSo each such circle corresponds to 4 triplets.\n\nHence, the number of distinct circles with 4 points is at most:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\binom{7}{3}}{4} = \\frac{35}{4} = 8.75.\n\\]\n\nBut circles must be integer in number.\n\nThus, maximum number of circles with exactly 4 points passing through them is at most 8.\n\nStep 17: Actually, since each 4-point circle accounts for 4 triplets of points, and there are only 35 triplets total, in an ideal arrangement with maximum number of circles each passing exactly 4 points, the number is:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{35}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 8.\n\\]\n\nStep 18: Check for overlaps among the circles or points on more than one circle.\n\nStep 19: So, the maximum number is 8 distinct circles passing through 4 points.\n\nStep 20: Final conclusion:\n\nThe maximum number of circles passing through exactly 4 points among 7 points is 8.\n\n---\n\n**Final answers:**\n\nProblem 1: All functions \\( f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) with \\( f(x) = a x \\) for some \\( a \\ge 0 \\).\n\nProblem 2: The maximum number of circles is 8.\n\n---\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1 reasoning: Setting x=0 leads to f(y^2) = f(0) + |y f(y)|. Checking for general form, assuming f(x) = a x + b, substituting and simplifying forces b=0 and a >= 0 to satisfy the equation for all y. The zero function is included as the case a=0. Other possibilities are ruled out. Therefore, all functions are f(x) = a x with a >= 0. Problem 2 reasoning: The problem is about the maximum number of distinct circles each passing through exactly 4 of 7 points. Each circle passing through 4 points contains 4 triplets of points. The total number of triplets is 35, so the maximum number of such circles is at most floor(35/4) = 8. Hence, the maximum number is 8.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"f(x) = a x where a >= 0\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"8\"\n}",
