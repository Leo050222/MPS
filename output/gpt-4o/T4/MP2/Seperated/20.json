By rule, a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile. The game ends when no tile can be placed according to this rule.

Possibly, but because Alice moves first and wants to maximize uncovered squares, she can try to block the board into odd segments.\n\nStep 9: Consider this: [Strategy of Alice]\n\nBy placing the first tile in the middle, Alice splits the board into two segments of equal length 1010 squares.\n\nNow Bob plays on one of them.\n\nEach move reduces the available segments.\n\nStep 10: Each segment is reduced by domino placement, preserving or creating further odd-length segments.\n\nStep 11: The key point is that for even-length segments, dominoes cover all squares perfectly; for odd-length segments, at least one remains uncovered.\n\nStep 12: The sum of lengths of the odd segments at the end gives the total number of uncovered squares.\n\nStep 13: Since Alice moves first and can choose how to split the board, she can guarantee at least two uncovered squares at the end.\n\nStep 14: For large even boards, the maximum number of uncovered squares can be shown to be 2.\n\nStep 15: Or more precise reasoning:\n\n- After the first tile, board is split into two equal segments length 1010 each (even).\n\n- Bob moves, placing tile on one side.\n\n- After some moves, a segment will become of odd length, thus one uncovered square.\n\n- Total uncovered squares is the sum over all odd-length segments.\n\nStep 16: Since the initial board length is even, the number of uncovered squares at the end is always even.\n\nStep 17: Formal result: On an even-length board, the maximum uncovered squares Alice can guarantee is 2.\n\nStep 18: Thus, final answer is 2.\n\n---\n\nFinal answers:\n\nProblem 1: Only solutions are\n\n- \\( n=1 \\), \\( k_1=1 \\)\n\n- \\( n=4 \\), \\( k_1=k_2=k_3=k_4=4 \\)\n\nProblem 2: Maximum uncovered squares Alice can ensure is 2.\n\n---\n\nNow, output the JSON as specified:\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"...\",\n    \"answer_1\": \"...\",\n    \"answer_2\": \"...\"\n}\n  \nThe reasoning is the text above.\n\nFor answer_1, specify all the solutions succinctly.\n\nFor answer_1: list the solutions as \\((n, k_1, ..., k_n)\\):\n\nFirst solution: n=1, k_1=1\n\nSecond solution: n=4, k_1=k_2=k_3=k_4=4\n\nExpressed as list of solutions:\n\n\\[\n\\{(1, [1]), (4, [4,4,4,4])\\}.\n\\]\n\nBecause the JSON is to contain only the answer value and no LaTeX, write as text:\n\n\"n=1, k_1=1; n=4, k_1=k_2=k_3=k_4=4\"\n\nAnswer_2 is \"2\".\n\n---\n\nFinal output:\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1 involves finding positive integers n and k_i such that the sum of the k_i is 5n -4 and the sum of their reciprocals is 1. By analysis, if all k_i are equal to n, then the reciprocal sum is n*(1/n) =1 and the sum of k_i is n*n = n^2. This matches 5n -4 only for n=1 and n=4. Checking these cases shows the two solutions: (n=1, k_1=1) and (n=4, k_i=4 for i=1 to 4). No other solutions satisfy both conditions. Problem 2 deals with a domino placement game on 2022 squares. Tiles cover adjacent two squares, and the game ends when no more placements are possible. Alice wants to maximize uncovered squares, Bob wants to minimize them. Since the board length is even, and domino tiles cover 2 squares, the number of uncovered squares at the end must be even. By strategic play, Alice can force at least two uncovered squares regardless of Bob’s play, but no more. Therefore, the greatest number of uncovered squares Alice can guarantee is 2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"n=1, k_1=1; n=4, k_1=k_2=k_3=k_4=4\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"2\"\n}",
