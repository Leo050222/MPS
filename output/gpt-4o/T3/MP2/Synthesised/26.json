  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Understanding the problem\\nWe are given a tetrahedron ABCD with volume 1, with edges from A to B, C, D all equal to 2, and the product of the three edges BC, CD, and DB equals 16.\\nWe want to find \\\\( \\\\delta = AX - \\\\frac{7}{10} \\\\), where AX is the altitude from A to the base BCD.\\nThen, in a separate Cartesian plane, with A=(0,0), B=(200,100), C=(30,330), we need to compute the number of integer coordinate points (x,y) so that \\\\((x+\\\\delta, y+\\\\delta)\\\\) lies in the interior of triangle ABC.\\n\\nStep 2: Use given geometric data\\nVolume \\(V = 1\\) of tetrahedron ABCD is given by\\n\\\\[\\nV = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times Area(BCD) \\\\times AX\\n\\\\]\\nsince AX is the altitude from A to the plane BCD.\\n\\nStep 3: From the problem, \\(AB = AC = AD = 2\\).\\nAlso, product \\(BC \\cdot CD \\cdot DB = 16\\).\\n\\nStep 4: Express volume in terms of known quantities.\\nIf we consider triangle BCD, then its area is \\(S_{BCD}\\),\\nwe have\\n\\\\[\\n1 = V = \\\\frac{1}{3} S_{BCD} \\\\cdot AX \\\\implies S_{BCD} = \\\\frac{3}{AX}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nStep 5: But we do not directly know \\(S_{BCD}\\) or \\(AX\\). Let's try to find \\(AX\\).\\n\\nRecall, edges \\(AB, AC, AD = 2\\).\\nUsing the formula for volume from edges for tetrahedron with known edges \\(AB, AC, AD, BC, CD, DB\\),\\ntetrahedron volume squared is\\n\\\\[V^2 = \\\\frac{1}{288} \\\\times \\\\det(G),\\\\]\\nwhere \\(G\\) is the Cayley-Menger matrix based on squares of edges.\\n\\nHowever, we are not given individual edges, only the product \\(BC \\cdot CD \\cdot DB =16\\).\\nSince \\(BC, CD, DB\\) are lengths in triangle BCD, their product is 16.\\n\\nStep 6: Note the product constraint, let's consider the possibility the edges are all equal on BCD.\\nSet \\(BC = CD = DB = t\\), then \\(t^3=16 \\\\implies t = 2.5198421\\\\).\\n\\nStep 7: Using this, BCD is equilateral triangle with side \\(t = 2.5198421\\)\\nArea of equilateral triangle with side \\(t\\) is\\n\\\\[\\nS = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{4} t^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\\\times (2.5198)^2 \\\\approx \\\\frac{1.732}{4} \\\\times 6.3496 = 0.433 \\times 6.3496 \\\\approx 2.75\\n\\\\]\\n\\nStep 8: Volume = \\\\(\\n\\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times S_{BCD} \\\\times AX =1 \\\\implies AX = \\\\frac{3}{S_{BCD}} = \\\\frac{3}{2.75} = 1.0909\\n\\\\)\\n\\nStep 9: Compute delta\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\delta = AX - \\\\frac{7}{10} = 1.0909 - 0.7 = 0.3909\\n\\\\]\\n\\nStep 10: Consider triangle ABC with given points A=(0,0), B=(200,100), C=(30,330).\\n\\nStep 11: Find area of triangle ABC\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Area} = \\\\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|\\n\\\\]\\nHere,\\n\\\\[\\nx_1=0, y_1=0, x_2=200, y_2=100, x_3=30, y_3=330\\n\\\\]\\nSo,\\n\\\\[\\nArea = \\\\frac{1}{2} |0(100-330) + 200(330-0) + 30(0 - 100)| = \\\\frac{1}{2} |0 + 66000 - 3000| = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\times 63000 = 31500\\n\\\\]\\n\\nStep 12: Formula to determine if point (X,Y) lies inside triangle ABC uses barycentric coordinates or area method.\\nWe want points \\\\((x+\\\\delta, y+\\\\delta)\\\\) inside triangle ABC, where x,y are integers.\\n\\nStep 13: Shift origin by -delta on both axes to get \\\\((X, Y) = (x + \\\\delta, y + \\\\delta)\\\\).\\nEquivalently, \\\\((x,y) = (X - \\\\delta, Y - \\\\delta)\\\\).\\n\\nStep 14: To count integral (x,y) such that \\\\((x+\\\\delta, y+\\\\delta)\\\\) is in interior of triangle ABC is the same as counting integer points in triangle ABC shifted by -delta:\\n\\nTriangle ABC shifted by vector (-delta,-delta) is triangle with vertices:\\nA' = (0 - delta, 0 - delta) = (-delta, -delta)\\nB' = (200 - delta, 100 - delta)\\nC' = (30 - delta, 330 - delta)\\n\\nStep 15: The number of integer points strictly inside a polygon can be found by Pick's theorem.\\n\\nPick's theorem:\\n\\\\[\\nA = I + \\\\frac{B}{2} - 1\\n\\\\]\\nwhere\\n- A is area of polygon\\n- I number of integer points strictly inside the polygon\\n- B number of integer points on the boundary\\n\\nCounting I requires knowing A and B.\\n\\nStep 16: Area does not change with translation, so area is still 31500.\\n\\nStep 17: Count B, the number of lattice points on the boundary of triangle A'B'C'.\\nSince translation by (-delta,-delta) is not integer (delta ~ 0.3909), the vertices are not integral points.\\n\\nNumber of lattice points on boundary edges is the sum over edges of the count of lattice points on each edge.\\nThe number of lattice points on line segment between two points P and Q with coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is \\n\\\\[\\n gcd(|x2 - x1|, |y2 - y1|) + 1\\n\\\\]\\nif both points are lattice points.\\n\\nBut here the points are not lattice points due to delta.\\n\\nStep 18: Translation by (-delta,-delta) shifts the triangle by a non-integer vector, so its vertices are not integral.\\nTherefore, its boundary points do not lie on lattice points.\\n\\nHence, no lattice points are on the boundary of the translated triangle.\\n\\nStep 19: So, B=0.\\n\\nStep 20: Substituting in Pick's formula:\\n\\\\[\\n31500 = I + \\\\frac{0}{2} -1 \\\\implies I = 31501\\n\\\\]\\n\\nStep 21: The number of integer points strictly inside triangle with vertices A'B'C' is 31501.\\n\\nStep 22: So the number of integral pairs (x,y) such that (x+delta,y+delta) lies in interior of ABC is 31501.\\n\\nFinal answer = 31501.\",\n  \"answer\": \"31501\"\n}",
