FemtoPravis is walking on an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard that wraps around at its edges (so squares on the left edge of the chessboard are adjacent to squares on the right edge, and similarly for the top and bottom edges). Each femtosecond, FemtoPravis moves in one of the four diagonal directions uniformly at random. After $n$ femtoseconds, what is the probability that FemtoPravis is at his original location?",
  "reasoning_content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Analyze the given equation:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{p}{q} - \\\\frac{4}{r+1} = 1\\n\\\\]\\nwhere p, q, r are prime numbers.\\n\\nStep 2: Rearrange the equation:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{p}{q} = 1 + \\\\frac{4}{r+1} = \\\\frac{r + 1 + 4}{r + 1} = \\\\frac{r + 5}{r + 1}\\n\\\\]\\nTherefore,\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{p}{q} = \\\\frac{r + 5}{r + 1}\\n\\\\]\\nSince p, q, r are prime numbers, and the fractions must be equal, the fractions \\\\(p/q\\\\) and \\\\((r+5)/(r+1)\\\\) must simplify to the same fraction in lowest terms.\\n\\nStep 3: Look for primes r such that \\\\(r + 1\\\\) and \\\\(r + 5\\\\) fit prime relationships.\\n\\nSince \\\\(q\\\\) is prime and equals the denominator in \\\\(p/q\\\\), it is likely that \\\\(q = r + 1\\\\) or a divisor of \\\\(r + 1\\\\).\\n\\nBut \\\\(r + 1\\\\) may not be prime (because r is prime, so r+1 is even for r=2 and possibly composite otherwise). We are told \\\"r + 1\\\" equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term, which is indeed the denominator in the second fraction, meaning \\\\(r + 1\\\\) is the denominator of the term subtracted from \\\\(p/q\\\\). There's a clarifying statement in the problem:\\\"Find \\(n = r + 2009\\), where \\(r\\) is the prime such that \\(r + 1\\) equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term.\\\"\n\nWait, the subtracted term is \\\\( \\\\frac{4}{r+1} \\\\), so numerator of the subtracted fractional term is 4. So this suggests \\\\(r + 1 = 4\\\\) is the numerator of the subtracted fraction? That contradicts.\n\nBut the problem said: \\\"such that r + 1 equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term.\\\" The subtracted term is \\\\(4 / (r+1)\\\\), so numerator is 4, denominator is r+1. So \\(r + 1\\) must equal 4, so \\(r + 1 = 4\\).\n\nHence,\\n\\\\[\\nr + 1 = 4 \\\\implies r = 3\\n\\\\]\\nCheck if \\(r=3\\) is prime: yes.\\n\\nStep 4: With \\(r = 3\\), then the equation becomes:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{p}{q} - \\\\frac{4}{3 + 1} = 1 \\\\implies \\\\frac{p}{q} - \\\\frac{4}{4} = 1 \\\\implies \\\\frac{p}{q} - 1 = 1 \\\\implies \\\\frac{p}{q} = 2\\n\\\\]\\nSo \\\\(p/q = 2\\\\).\\nSince p and q are prime, p/q = 2 means \\(p = 2q\\). Since p is prime, and q is prime, the only way is \\(p=2\\) and \\(q=1\\), but 1 is not prime.\\nWait, try \\(q=2\\), then \\(p=4\\), but 4 is not prime.\\nTry \\(q=3\\), then \\(p=6\\) not prime.\\nTry \\(q=5\\), then \\(p=10\\) not prime.\\nTry \\(q=7\\), then \\(p=14\\) not prime.\\nTry \\(q=11\\), then \\(p=22\\) not prime.\\n\\nNo solutions, so this is not consistent.\\n\\nStep 5: Reconsider interpretation of the statement. The problem says \\\"Instead of finding all primes \\(p,q,r\\) satisfying the equation, simply find \\(n = r + 2009\\), where \\(r\\) is the prime such that \\(r + 1\\) equals the numerator of the subtracted fractional term.\\\"\\n\\nThe subtracted fractional term is \\\\(\\\\frac{4}{r + 1}\\\\).\\nThe numerator of the subtracted term is 4, which is fixed and not possibly equal to \\(r + 1\\). So the only way \\(r + 1 = 4\\) is if \\(r = 3\\).\\n\\nThen, as above, the fraction equation is:\\n[\\n\\\\fracp}{q} - 1 = 1 \\\\implies \\\\frac{p}{q} = 2\\n\\\\]\\nwhich has no prime solution, so no solution here.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants us to interpret \\(r + 1\\) as the numerator of the subtracted term when the term is expressed in lowest terms.\\n\\nThe subtracted term is \\\\(\\\\frac{4}{r+1}\\\\), where \\(r\\) is prime.\\n\\nTry to write \\\\(\\\\frac{4}{r + 1} = \\\\frac{A}{B}\\\\) in lowest terms with numerator \\(A = r + 1\\).\\n\\nWait, the only way the numerator is equal to \\(r + 1\\) is if \\\\(4 = (r + 1) * k\\\\) where \\(k\\) is the scaling factor to reduce the fraction to the lowest terms.\\n\\nThis cannot be, because numerator is fixed as 4.\\n\\nAlternatively, the problem might be inconsistently worded, but may expect to just set \\(r + 1 = 4\\), i.e., the numerator of the fraction is 4, so \\(r + 1 = 4\\) implying \\(r=3\\). Then \\(n = r + 2009 = 3 + 2009 = 2012\\).\\n\\nStep 6: Now, for the second part: FemtoPravis is on an 8x8 chessboard with wrapping edges (torus). Each femtosecond, he moves diagonally in one of four directions uniformly at random.\\n\\nAt each step, the position changes by moving either:\\n- up-right: (1, -1)\\n- up-left: (-1, -1)\\n- down-right: (1, 1)\\n- down-left: (-1, 1)\\n\\nAll modulo 8.\\n\\nAfter \\(n = 2012\\) steps, what is the probability that he is at the starting location?\\n\\nStep 7: Consider decomposition of the moves in x and y directions modulo 8.\\nAt each step, x changes by either +1 or -1 (equally likely 0.5 probability each)\\nand y changes by either +1 or -1 (equally likely 0.5 probability each), independent.\\n\\nSo the horizontal and vertical steps are independent random walks on the cyclic group of order 8.\\n\\nNumber of steps \\(n = 2012\\).\\n\\nProbability that after \\(n\\) steps the horizontal walk returns to 0 is:\\n\\\\[\\nP_x(0) = \\\\binom{n}{n/2} (1/2)^n\\n\\\\]\\nSimilarly for vertical:\\n\\\\[\\nP_y(0) = \\\\binom{n}{n/2} (1/2)^n\\n\\\\]\\nOnly if \\(n\\) is even, the returns possible at step \\(n\\).\\n\\nHere, \\(n = 2012\\) is even.\\nThus,\\n\\\\[\\nP_{return} = P_x(0) * P_y(0) = \\\\left( \\\\binom{2012}{1006} (1/2)^{2012} \\\\right)^2 = \\\\left( \\\\binom{2012}{1006} \\\\right)^2 (1/2)^{4024}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nStep 8: Final answer:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{P = \\\\left( \\\\binom{2012}{1006} \\\\right)^2 / 2^{4024}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSince the problem requests the probability in exact form, this is the exact probability.\\n\\nStep 9: Put answers in JSON format.\\n\\nNote: The problem wants only final answer in the answer field, so everything else is under reasoning.\\n\\nCalculate \\(n = r + 2009 = 3 + 2009 = 2012\\), and the probability is as above.\\n\\nHence,\\n{\\n  \\\"reasoning\\\": \\\"Detailed reasoning and solution steps as above.\\\",\\n  \\\"answer\\\": \\\"(binomial(2012,1006))^2 / 2^4024\\\"\\n}\",\n  \"answer\": \"(binomial(2012,1006))^2 / 2^4024\"\n}",
