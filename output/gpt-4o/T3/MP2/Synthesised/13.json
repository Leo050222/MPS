  "math_problem": "Let $n$ be square with 4 digits, such that all its digits are less than 6. If we add 1 to each digit the resulting number is another square. Find $n$ Instead of identifying the 4-digit perfect square satisfying the digit increment condition, simply find $m = a - 42$, where $a$ is the integer whose square is that number. P is a polynomial. When P is divided by $x-1$, the remainder is -4 . When P is divided by $x-2$, the remainder is -1 . When $P$ is divided by $x-3$, the remainder is 4 . Determine the remainder when $P$ is divided by $x^{m}-6 x^{2}+11 x-6$.",

No (64^2=4096, 65^2=4225).\\n\\nStep 4: Check some values:\\n- 45^2=2025 (digits 2,0,2,5 <6)\\n  Add 1 to each digit: 3136\\n  3136=56^2\\n  Both perfect squares.\\n\\nSo n = 2025, a=45.\\n\\nStep 5: Compute m = a - 42 = 45 - 42 = 3.\\n\\nStep 6: Polynomial remainder problem\\n- Given P is a polynomial with conditions:\\n  P(1) = remainder when divided by x-1 = -4\\n  P(2) = remainder when divided by x-2 = -1\\n  P(3) = remainder when divided by x-3 = 4\\n\\nSo P(1) = -4, P(2) = -1, P(3) = 4.\\n\\nStep 7: Find remainder when P is divided by x^m - 6x^2 + 11x -6.\\n\\nNote:\\nx^m is x^3 (since m=3), so divisor polynomial is:\\n x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6\\n\\nStep 8: Factor the divisor polynomial:\\nCheck roots:\\nAt x=1: 1 -6 +11 -6=0\\nAt x=2: 8 -24 +22 -6=0\\nAt x=3: 27 -54 +33 -6=0\\n\\nSo divisor polynomial factors as (x-1)(x-2)(x-3).\\n\\nStep 9: Since degree(divisor) = 3, remainder has degree at most 2:\\nR(x) = A x^2 + B x + C\\n\\nStep 10: Since P(x) mod divisor = R(x), and divisor divides P(x) - R(x), we have:\\nP(i) = R(i) for i=1,2,3.\\n\\nUse P(1) = R(1) = -4\\nP(2) = R(2) = -1\\nP(3) = R(3) = 4\\n\\nSo system:\\nA*1 + B*1 + C = -4\\nA*4 + B*2 + C = -1\\nA*9 + B*3 + C = 4\\n\\nEquations:\\n1) A + B + C = -4\\n2) 4A + 2B + C = -1\\n3) 9A + 3B + C = 4\\n\\nStep 11: Solve system\\nFrom 1): C = -4 - A - B\\nSubstitute into 2): 4A + 2B + (-4 - A - B) = -1 => 3A + B -4 = -1 => 3A + B = 3\\nSubstitute into 3): 9A + 3B + (-4 - A - B) = 4 => 8A + 2B -4 = 4 => 8A + 2B = 8\\n\\nFrom 3A + B = 3 => B = 3 - 3A\\nPlug into 8A + 2B = 8:\\n8A + 2(3 - 3A) = 8\\n8A + 6 - 6A = 8\\n2A + 6 = 8\\n2A = 2\\nA = 1\\n\\nThen B = 3 - 3(1) = 0\\nC = -4 -1 -0 = -5\\n\\nStep 12: The remainder:\\nR(x) = x^2 + 0*x - 5 = x^2 - 5\\n\\nFinal answer to remainder when P is divided by x^3 - 6x^2 +11x -6 is x^2 - 5.\\n\\nStep 13: Provide answer in required JSON format (only the answer value).\\n\\nSince the remainder is a polynomial x^2 - 5, write as \\\"x^2-5\\\".\\n\\n{  \\\"answer\\\": \\\"x^2-5\\\"  }\",\n    \"answer\": \"x^2-5\"\n}",
