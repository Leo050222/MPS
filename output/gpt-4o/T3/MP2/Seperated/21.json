Thus, both factors are powers of two.\n\nStep 3: Denote \\(x - y = 2^k\\), and\n\\[\nS = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} y + \\cdots + y^{n-1} = 2^{100 - k}.\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Since both \\(x, y\\) positive integers, and difference \\(x - y = 2^k\\), both \\(x, y\\) must be powers of 2 for sum \\(S\\) to be a power of 2.\n\nReason: Because the sum is sum of terms each with powers of \\(x, y\\). If \\(x, y\\) are even or odd, sum won't be pure power of 2 unless both \\(x, y\\) are powers of 2.\n\nStep 5: Let \\(x = 2^a, y = 2^b\\) with \\(a > b \\geq 0\\).\n\nThen,\n\\[\nx^n - y^n = 2^{an} - 2^{bn} = 2^{bn} (2^{(a-b) n} - 1) = 2^{100}.\n\\]\n\nBecause right side is a pure power of two, the bracket must be 1, i.e.,\n\\[\n2^{(a - b) n} - 1 = 1 \\implies 2^{(a - b) n} = 2,\n\\]\nsince subtracting 1 must give exactly 1.\n\nThis implies\n\\[\n2^{(a - b)n} = 2 \\implies (a - b) n = 1.\n\\]\n\nBut \\(a, b, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\) with \\(n > 1\\), so \\( (a - b) n = 1\\) is impossible because the right side is 1 while left side at least 2.\n\nTherefore, this factorization approach contradicts power-of-two formation unless \\(2^{(a-b)n} - 1 = 1\\), which is impossible.\n\nStep 6: Reconsider \\(x^n - y^n = 2^{100}\\) with the sum factor approach; if the sum is not a pure power of two, contradiction.\n\nStep 7: Try \\(n=2\\),\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) = 2^{100}.\n\\]\n\nAgain, write:\n\\[\nx - y = 2^k, \\quad x + y = 2^{100 - k}.\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(x+y) + (x-y)}{2} = \\frac{2^{100 - k} + 2^{k}}{2},\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{(x+y) - (x-y)}{2} = \\frac{2^{100 - k} - 2^{k}}{2}.\n\\]\n\nTo get integers \\(x, y\\), both numerators must be even.\n\nCheck parity:\n\n- If \\(k = 0\\), \\(x-y=1\\), odd, so \\(x, y\\) may not be integers.\n- Both powers are powers of two; the sum \\(2^{100 - k} + 2^k\\) is divisible by 2 always because \\(k \\geq 1\\).\n\nSo \\(k\\) can be from 1 to 99.\n\nFor \\(k=1\\) to \\(99\\), \\(x, y\\) are positive integers.\n\nAlso, \\(y \\ge 1\\), so \\(2^{100-k} > 2^k\\), so \\(100-k > k \\Rightarrow 100 > 2k \\Rightarrow k < 50\\).\n\nSo \\(k = 1, 2, ..., 49\\).\n\nThis gives 49 solutions for \\(n=2\\).\n\nStep 8: For \\(n > 2\\):\n\nThe difference of two perfect powers equals a pure power of two.\n\nBy the Catalan conjecture (now Mihăilescu's theorem), the only consecutive perfect powers differing by 1 are 8 and 9, no other integer powers differ by 2^{100}.\n\nStep 9: Thus, for \\(n > 2\\), no solutions exist because \\(x^n - y^n = 2^{100}\\) with \\(n>2\\) and positive integer solutions is impossible unless difference is 1.\n\nHence, only \\(n=2\\) yields solutions.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, number of ordered solutions \\((x,y,n)\\) is number of valid \\(k\\) in Step 7 times 1 (since \\(n=2\\)):\n\nNumber of solutions = 49.\n\n---\n\nFinal answers:\n\nProblem 1: Inequality proven with maximum sum = 4/9.\n\nProblem 2: The number of ordered triples \\((x,y,n)\\) is 49.\n\n---\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We analyzed the function f(t) = t/(t^3 + 8) for t >= 0 and found it attains a maximum near the point t=1. Using the tangent line approximation at t=1 and verifying it bounds f(t) from above, we applied the linearity and sum of variables constraint to prove the given inequality. Equality holds at a = b = c = d = 1, giving the maximum sum 4/9.\\n\\nProblem 2: Setting x = 2^a, y = 2^b for integers a > b >= 0, the difference x^n - y^n = 2^{bn}(2^{(a-b)n} - 1) equals a pure power of two only if 2^{(a-b)n} - 1 = 1, impossible for n > 1. Considering n=2 leads to factorization into (x - y)(x + y) = 2^{100} with both factors powers of two. Letting x - y = 2^k and x + y = 2^{100 - k}, we find integer solutions for k = 1 to 49. For n > 2 no solutions exist due to Mihăilescu's theorem. Thus, there are 49 ordered triples (x,y,n) with n=2.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"4/9\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"49\"\n}",
