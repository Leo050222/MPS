  "reasoning_content": "Problem 1:\n\nWe have a pile of 2015 rocks. At each round, if the pile has N rocks, Alice removes k rocks, where k is chosen uniformly at random from 1 to N. The process repeats until the pile is empty.\n\nWe want to find p = the probability that after each removal, the number of rocks left is always a multiple of 5. The initial number is 2015, which is divisible by 5 since 2015/5 = 403.\n\nWe need to find the probability that, starting from 2015 rocks, the pile size after each removal remains a multiple of 5, until it reaches zero.\n\nLet’s define:\n\n- State space: the number of rocks left, N, from 0 up to 2015.\n\n- Define a function f(N): the probability that starting from N rocks, the pile sizes after each round are always multiples of 5 until zero.\n\nWe want to find f(2015).\n\nBoundary condition: f(0) = 1, since the pile is empty and we made no further removals.\n\nAt state N>0:\n\n- Alice removes k in {1,...,N} uniformly.\n\n- After removal, the pile size reduces to N-k.\n\n- We want the next pile size N-k to be a multiple of 5, otherwise this path fails.\n\n- So among k from 1 to N, only those k such that N-k ≡ 0 mod 5 are possible to keep the property; only those terms contribute to f(N).\n\nProbabilistic equation:\n\nf(N) = (number of allowed k) / N * f(N-k for allowed k)\n\nWait, it's a probability over all possible k. Since k is picked uniformly from 1 to N, if for some k, N-k is not multiple of 5, that branch leads to failure so it does not contribute to success probability.\n\nSo:\n\nf(N) = (1/N) * sum_{k=1 to N, (N-k) mod 5 = 0} f(N-k)\n\nBecause for other k, the path fails immediately.\n\nWe seek f(2015).\n\nBecause N-k ≡ 0 mod 5 means N-k is in the set multiples of 5 less than N.\n\nLet’s define M = N mod 5.\n\nThen for allowed k:\n\nN-k ≡ 0 mod 5 => k ≡ N mod 5 => k ≡ M mod 5\n\nTherefore, allowed k satisfy:\n\nk ≡ M mod 5, k in {1, ..., N}\n\nSo among all k=1 to N, only those congruent to M mod 5 are allowed.\n\nThe number of allowed k is:\n\nNumber of integers k in [1,N] with k ≡ M mod 5.\n\nFor N large, the count of numbers congruent to M mod 5 in [1..N] is:\n\ncount = floor((N - M)/5) + 1 if M <= N mod 5 else floor((N - M)/5)\n\nBut because M = N mod 5, the number is:\n\ncount = floor((N - M)/5) + 1\n\nIndeed, for example if N=2015, N mod 5 = 0, M=0.\n\nThen k ≡ 0 mod 5, k ∈ [1..2015].\n\nNumbers congruent to 0 mod 5 in 1..2015 are {5,10,15,...,2015}. Count = 2015 / 5 = 403.\n\nNote that 0 mod 5 corresponds to 5,10,... not 0 itself since k≥1.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAt N divisible by 5 (i.e. M=0), allowed k are k ≡ 0 mod 5 in [1..N], count = N/5.\n\nAt N not divisible by 5, similar counts apply.\n\nSummary:\n\n- For N, let M = N mod 5\n\n- Allowed k satisfy k ≡ M mod 5\n\n- Counts of allowed k: call it c(N)\n\nWe rewrite equation:\n\nf(N) = (1/N) * sum over allowed k f(N - k)\n\nNote that N-k is a multiple of 5, so N-k mod 5=0.\n\nBecause N mod 5 = M, k mod 5 = M,\n\n=> (N - k) mod 5 = (M - M) mod 5 = 0.\n\nTherefore, N-k = 5 * m for some m < N/5.\n\nSo the argument of f is always a multiple of 5.\n\nAlso, since we want to define f only on multiples of 5 (others are zero), f(N) = 0 if N mod 5 ≠ 0, because the path fails immediately at the next step (cannot keep all multiples of 5 if starting size is not multiple of 5).\n\nHence:\n\n- for N mod 5 ≠ 0 => f(N) = 0\n\n- for N mod 5 = 0 => f(N) as defined above.\n\nDefine g(m) = f(5m), m = 0,1,2,...,403 (since 2015/5=403)\n\nWe have:\n\nFor N=5m:\n\nf(5m) = (1/(5m)) * sum over k in [1..5m], k ≡ 0 mod 5 (since M=0), of f(5m - k)\n\nSince k ≡ 0 mod 5 in [1..5m], k = 5i, i=1..m\n\nSo:\n\nf(5m) = (1/(5m)) * sum_{i=1}^{m} f(5m - 5i)  \n= (1/(5m)) * sum_{i=1}^{m} f(5(m - i)) = (1/(5m)) * sum_{i=1}^{m} g(m - i)\n\nLet j = m - i, as i goes 1 to m, j goes from m-1 down to 0.\n\nSum_{i=1}^{m} g(m - i) = Sum_{j=0}^{m-1} g(j)\n\nTherefore:\n\ng(m) = f(5m) = (1/(5m)) * sum_{j=0}^{m-1} g(j), for m ≥ 1\n\nBoundary: g(0) = f(0) = 1 (empty pile)\n\nWe want g(403).\n\nWe have a recurrence:\n\ng(0) = 1\n\nFor m≥1:\n\ng(m) = (1/(5m)) * sum_{j=0}^{m-1} g(j)\n\nDefine S(m) = sum_{j=0}^m g(j)\n\nThen:\n\ng(m) = S(m-1) / (5 m)\n\nAlso:\n\nS(m) = S(m-1) + g(m) = S(m-1) + S(m-1)/(5 m) = S(m-1)*(1 + 1/(5 m)) = S(m-1) * ( (5m +1) / (5m) )\n\nWith S(0) = g(0) = 1\n\nSo:\n\nS(1) = S(0) * ( (5*1 +1)/(5*1) ) = 1 * 6/5 = 6/5\n\nS(2) = S(1) * ( (5*2 +1)/(5*2) ) = (6/5) * (11/10) = 66/50 = 33/25\n\nAnd so on.\n\nGeneral formula:\n\nS(m) = product_{k=1}^m (5k + 1)/(5k)\n\nRewrite:\n\nS(m) = product_{k=1}^m (5k + 1)/(5k) = product_{k=1}^m (5k + 1) / product_{k=1}^m 5k = (Π_{k=1}^m (5k +1)) / (5^m * m!)\n\ng(m) = S(m) - S(m-1) = S(m-1)* ( (5m+1)/(5m) - 1 ) = S(m-1) * (1/(5m)) = (S(m-1))/(5m)\n\nwhich matches earlier formula.\n\nBut we only want g(m) = f(5m).\n\nSo:\n\ng(m) = S(m-1) / (5m) = [product_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k +1)/(5k)] * (1/(5m))\n\n= (1/(5m)) * (product_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k + 1) / (5k))\n\nLet’s write numerator and denominator carefully.\n\nNumerator: product_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k +1)\n\nDenominator: product_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k) * 5m = 5^{m} * (m-1)! * m = 5^{m} * m!\n\nSo denominator = 5^{m} m!\n\nTherefore:\n\ng(m) = (1/(5m)) * product_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k +1) / product_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k) = product_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k +1) / (5^{m} m!)\n\nor equivalently:\n\ng(m) = [product_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k+1)] / [5^{m} * m!]\n\nBecause:\n\nproduct_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k) = 5^{m-1} * (m-1)!\n\nand denominator has extra 5m to go to 5^{m}, m!\n\nCheck the expression again:\n\nStarting with:\n\ng(m) = S(m-1) / (5m)\n\nBut S(m-1) = product_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k +1)/(5k) = product_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k+1) / (5^{m-1} * (m-1)!)\n\nSo:\n\ng(m) = [product_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k+1)] / [5^{m-1} (m-1)!] * (1/(5m)) = [product_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k+1)] / [5^{m} * m * (m-1)!]\n\nBut m * (m-1)! = m!\n\nTherefore:\n\ng(m) = [product_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k+1)] / [5^{m} * m!]\n\nHence confirmed:\n\nf(5m) = g(m) = product_{k=1}^{m-1} (5k+1) / (5^{m} * m!)\n\nNow recall that f(N) = 0 if N mod 5 ≠ 0\n\nHence f(2015) = g(403):\n\ng(403) = product_{k=1}^{402} (5k +1) / (5^{403} * 403!)\n\nNow, the problem states that p = f(2015) is of the form:\n\np = 5^a * 31^b * (c/d) with c,d positive integers relatively prime to 5*31\n\nTask: find a+b.\n\nWe need to factor the numerator and denominator as much as possible.\n\nFirst, note that product_{k=1}^{402} (5k+1) is\n\n(5*1 +1)(5*2 +1)(5*3 +1)...(5*402 +1)\n\n= 6 * 11 * 16 * ... * (5*402 +1)\n\nWe want to find the exact powers of 5 and 31 dividing numerator and denominator.\n\nDenominator:\n\nDenominator = 5^{403} * 403!\n\nNumerator:\n\nproduct_{k=1}^{402}(5k+1)\n\nNote 5k+1 ≡ 1 mod 5, so no factors of 5 in numerator.\n\nTherefore, the power of 5 in numerator is 0.\n\nThus, all powers of 5 come from denominator: 5^{403} * 403!\n\nPower of 5 in denominator = 403 (from 5^{403}) + number of 5's in 403!\n\nCompute power of 5 in 403!:\n\nPower of 5 in n! = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + floor(n/625) + ...\n\nFor 403:\n\nfloor(403/5) = 80\n\nfloor(403/25) = 16\n\nfloor(403/125) = 3\n\nfloor(403/625) = 0\n\nSum = 80 +16 +3 = 99\n\nHence total power of 5 in denominator is 403 + 99 = 502\n\nNo 5 powers in numerator, so overall factor includes 5^{-502}.\n\nHence a = -502.\n\nSimilarly, let's check powers of 31.\n\nCheck denominator for power of 31:\n\nCount power of 31 in 403!:\n\nfloor(403/31) = 13\n\nfloor(403/31^2) = floor(403/961) = 0\n\nSum = 13\n\nNo 31's in 5^{403} obviously.\n\nNow numerator:\n\nproduct_{k=1}^{402} (5k+1)\n\nFind how many terms divisible by 31.\n\nSolve for k: 5k +1 ≡ 0 mod 31\n\n=> 5k ≡ -1 ≡ 30 mod 31\n\nMultiply both sides by inverse of 5 mod 31.\n\nInverse of 5 modulo 31 is 25, because 5*25=125 ≡ 1 mod 31 (since 125-4*31=125-124=1).\n\nTherefore:\n\nk ≡ 30 * 25 ≡ 750 mod 31\n\nCompute 750 mod 31:\n\n31*24=744, 750-744=6\n\nSo k ≡ 6 mod 31.\n\nSo terms with k = 6, 37, 68, ..., up to 402 are divisible by 31.\n\nNumber of such terms:\n\nFrom k=6 to 402 with step 31:\n\nNumber = floor((402-6)/31)+1= floor(396/31)+1 = 12+1=13\n\nExactly 13 terms divisible by 31.\n\nEach such term has at least one factor of 31.\n\nAny higher powers?\n\nCheck if any term divisible by 31^2=961.\n\n5k+1 ≡ 0 mod 961\n\n=> 5k ≡ -1 ≡ 960 mod 961\n\nInverse of 5 mod 961?\n\nSince 961=31^2.\n\nLet’s find inverse of 5 mod 961.\n\nWe use extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nTry 5*192=960 mod 961=960, 5*193=965 mod 961=4\n\nSince 5*192=960, but inverse should satisfy 5*x=1 mod 961.\n\nTry 5*577=2885, mod 961: 2885 - 3*961=2885-2883=2\n\nSimilarly, maybe best to use extended Euclid:\n\nFind integers x,y such that 5x + 961 y = 1.\n\n961 mod 5 = 1, so:\n\n961 = 5*192 + 1\n\n=> 1 = 961 - 5*192\n\n=> So inverse of 5 mod 961 is -192 mod 961 = 961 - 192 = 769\n\nCheck 5*769 = ?\n\n5*769=3845\n\n3845 mod 961:\n\n961*4=3844\n\n3845 -3844=1\n\nPerfect, inverse is 769.\n\nSo k ≡ -1 * 769 = -769 ≡ 961 -769 = 192 mod 961.\n\nSo k ≡ 192 mod 961.\n\nBut k ≤ 402, so only 192 fits.\n\nTherefore one term:\n\nk=192 => 5*192 + 1 = 961 *1 = 961 divisible by 31^2.\n\nSo one term divisible by 31^2.\n\nOther terms are:\n\nk=192 + 961 * t\n\nOnly t=0 is ≤402.\n\nTherefore only one term divisible by 31^2.\n\nSimilarly check for 31^3=29791\n\n5k +1 ≡ 0 mod 29791\n\n5k ≡ -1 mod 29791\n\nFind inverse of 5 mod 29791 using extended Euclidean algorithm:\n\nSince 29791 = 31^3.\n\nBut since 5 * 769 = 3845 mod 961 =1,\n\nWe know the inverse mod 31^3 will be some integer (calculate or accept no multiples up to 402 since 29791 > 402).\n\nSo no term divisible by 31^3.\n\nSo total power of 31 in numerator factor:\n\nEach term divisible by 31 contributes power 1, except k=192 contributes an extra 1 (since divisible by 31^2).\n\nHence total power:\n\nCount of terms divisible by 31: 13 (including k=192)\n\nExtra power for k=192 = 1\n\nTotal power in numerator = 13 + 1 = 14\n\nDenominator:\n\nNumber of 31's in 403! = 13\n\nNet power of 31 in fraction p:\n\nPower in numerator minus power in denominator:\n\n=14 - 13 =1\n\nSo b=1.\n\nTherefore, p = 5^{-502} * 31^{1} * (c/d)\n\nWhere c,d are positive integers coprime to 5 and 31.\n\nAsked to find a + b = -502 + 1 = -501\n\nProblem 1 answer: -501\n\n----\n\nProblem 2:\n\nSystem:\n\nx + y + z = 3\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3\n\nFind all (x,y,z) solutions, real or complex.\n\nApproach:\n\nUse Newton's identity or symmetry:\n\nLet s1 = x + y + z = 3\n\ns2 = xy + yz + zx = ?\n\ns3 = xyz = ?\n\nFrom power sums:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = s_3 = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3\n\nRecall identity:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\n\nLet’s use:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3xyz + (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx)\n\nFrom standard identity:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3xyz + s1^3 - 3 s1 s2\n\nGiven:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3\n\ns1 = 3\n\nTherefore:\n\n3 = 3xyz + 3^3 - 3*3*s2\n\n=> 3 = 3xyz + 27 - 9 s2\n\n=> rearranged:\n\n3xyz = 3 -27 + 9 s2 = -24 + 9 s2\n\n=> xyz = (-24 + 9 s2)/3 = -8 + 3 s2\n\nSo:\n\ns3 = xyz = -8 + 3 s2\n\nWe want to find s2 and s3 to determine roots (x,y,z) as roots of cubic equation:\n\nt^3 - s1 t^2 + s2 t - s3 = 0\n\n=> t^3 - 3 t^2 + s2 t - s3 = 0\n\nSubstituting s3 = -8 + 3 s2:\n\nt^3 - 3 t^2 + s2 t - (-8 + 3 s2) = 0\n\n=> t^3 - 3 t^2 + s2 t + 8 - 3 s2 = 0\n\n=> t^3 - 3 t^2 + s2 t - 3 s2 + 8 = 0\n\n---\n\nNow let's try to find s2.\n\nTry to guess integer solutions.\n\nTry all three equal:\n\nx = y = z\n\nThen:\n\n3 x =3 => x=1\n\nCheck if x=1 satisfies second:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 * 1^3 =3, yes\n\nTherefore (1,1,1) is a solution.\n\nSo roots of cubic equation must include x=1 as triple root or at least root.\n\nTry t=1 in cubic:\n\nt=1:\n\n1 - 3 + s2 - 3 s2 + 8 = 1 -3 + s2 -3 s2 +8 = (1-3+8) + s2 -3 s2 = 6 - 2 s2\n\nSet = 0:\n\n6 - 2 s2 = 0 => 2 s2=6 => s2=3\n\nThen\n\ns3 = -8 + 3 s2 = -8 + 9 =1\n\nSo now cubic is:\n\nt^3 - 3 t^2 + 3 t - 1 = 0\n\nNote that:\n\n(t-1)^3 = t^3 - 3 t^2 + 3 t -1\n\nTherefore the polynomial has triple root t=1.\n\nThus solution (1,1,1).\n\n---\n\nAny other solutions?\n\nTry to find solutions with two roots equal.\n\nLet y = z = a, x = b.\n\nGiven:\n\nx + 2 a =3\n\nx^3 + 2 a^3 =3\n\nSet x = t\n\nThen, x + 2a =3 => a = (3 - t)/2\n\nThen:\n\nx^3 + 2 a^3 = t^3 + 2 * ((3 - t)/2)^3 = 3\n\nSimplify the cube:\n\n(3 - t)^3 / 4\n\nSince 2 * ((3 - t)/2)^3 = 2 * (3 - t)^3 / 8 = (3 - t)^3 / 4\n\nSo:\n\nt^3 + (3 - t)^3 / 4 = 3\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n4 t^3 + (3 - t)^3 = 12\n\nExpand (3 - t)^3:\n\n(3 - t)^3 = 27 - 27 t + 9 t^2 - t^3\n\nEquation:\n\n4 t^3 + 27 - 27 t + 9 t^2 - t^3 = 12\n\nSimplify:\n\n(4 t^3 - t^3) + 9 t^2 - 27 t + 27 = 12\n\n=> 3 t^3 + 9 t^2 - 27 t + 27 =12\n\nSubtract 12:\n\n3 t^3 + 9 t^2 -27 t + 15 = 0\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nt^3 + 3 t^2 - 9 t + 5 = 0\n\nSolve cubic:\n\nt^3 + 3 t^2 - 9 t + 5 = 0\n\nCheck roots:\n\nTry t=1:\n\n1 + 3 -9 +5=0\n\n=> (1+3)-9+5=4 -9 +5=0\n\nt=1 is a root.\n\nDivide cubic by (t-1):\n\nUsing polynomial division:\n\nCoefficients: 1   3   -9   5\n\nDivide by (t-1):\n\nBring down 1\n\nMultiply by 1: 1, add 3+1=4\n\nMultiply by 1: 4, add -9+4=-5\n\nMultiply by 1: -5, add 5-5=0\n\nSo quotient: t^2 + 4 t - 5\n\nRoots of t^2 + 4 t - 5 = 0:\n\nt = [-4 ± sqrt(16+20)]/2 = [-4 ± sqrt(36)]/2 = (-4 ± 6)/2\n\nt1= (2)/2=1\n\nt2= (-10)/2 = -5\n\nHence roots:\n\nt=1 (double root), t = -5\n\nBut since t=1 is root, so roots are t=1 (double), t=-5\n\nSo the solutions for x:\n\nx = t in {1, -5}\n\nBack to a = (3 - t)/2\n\nFor t=1:\n\na = (3 -1)/2 = 1\n\nSo (x,y,z) = (1,1,1), already known.\n\nFor t = -5\n\na = (3 - (-5))/2 = (3 +5)/2 = 8/2 =4\n\nSo x = -5, y = z = 4\n\nCheck sums:\n\nx + y + z = -5 + 4 + 4 = 3, correct\n\nCheck cubes:\n\n(-5)^3 + 4^3 + 4^3 = -125 + 64 + 64 = 3\n\nYes correct.\n\nSimilarly swapping variables, get permutations of (-5, 4, 4).\n\nOther permutations:\n\n(4,-5,4), (4,4,-5)\n\nSo solutions are:\n\n(1,1,1) and permutations of (4,4,-5).\n\nIs there any solution with three distinct roots?\n\nTry to use the cubic polynomial found earlier:\n\nt^3 - 3 t^2 + 3 t -1 =0\n\nTriple root t=1\n\nNo other roots.\n\nSo all roots sum to 3.\n\nTherefore, solution set is:\n\n- (1,1,1)\n\n- (4,4,-5) and all permutations\n\n---\n\nFinal answer for problem 2: The roots (x,y,z) are the triples which are permutations of (1,1,1) or (4,4,-5).\n\n---\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: define f(N) as probability that starting from N rocks, number of rocks after each removal remains multiple of 5.
