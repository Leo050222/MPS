Each increment is one of \\(\\pm 1\\), with joint distribution:\n\nThe possible increments are:\n\n- \\( (1,1) \\) with prob 1/4\n- \\((-1,1)\\) with prob 1/4\n- \\( (1,-1) \\) with prob 1/4\n- \\((-1,-1)\\) with prob 1/4\n\nNotice:\n\n- \\(X_i\\) is equally likely \\(\\pm 1\\).\n- \\(Y_i\\) is equally likely \\(\\pm 1\\).\n- But \\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\) are NOT independent, since \\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\) always have the same sign or opposite sign: more detailed, \\(X_i Y_i = +1\\) or -1.\n\nArea of dependence: \\(P(X_i=1,Y_i=1)=1/4\\), \\(P(X_i=-1,Y_i=1)=1/4\\), \\(P(X_i=1,Y_i=-1)=1/4\\), \\(P(X_i=-1,Y_i=-1)=1/4\\).\n\nConsider the joint PMF of \\((X_i,Y_i)\\):\n\n- \\(P(X_i=1,Y_i=1) = 1/4\\)\n- \\(P(X_i=1,Y_i=-1) = 1/4\\)\n- \\(P(X_i=-1,Y_i=1) = 1/4\\)\n- \\(P(X_i=-1,Y_i=-1) =1/4\\)\n\nActually, this does look uniform on the four possibilities.\n\n---\n\nStep 2: Analyze sums \\(S_x = \\sum_{i=1}^{2012} X_i\\), \\(S_y = \\sum_{i=1}^{2012} Y_i\\) mod 8.\n\nWe want \n\\[\nS_x \\equiv 0 \\mod 8, \\quad S_y \\equiv 0 \\mod 8.\n\\]\n\nReturn to original squares means the net displacement modulo 8 is zero in both coordinates.\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Because the moves are on a torus, the position is determined modulo 8.\n\nWe want:\n\\[\nP(S_x \\equiv 0 \\mod 8, S_y \\equiv 0 \\mod 8).\n\\]\n\n---\n\nStep 4: Explore the distribution of \\(\\mathbf{D} = (X_i, Y_i)\\).\n\nCall the increments random variables \\(D_i = (X_i, Y_i)\\), i.i.d. with each of four possibilities with probability 1/4.\n\nSum \\(S = \\sum_{i=1}^n D_i\\) mod 8 is a random walk on \\(\\mathbb{Z}_8 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_8\\).\n\nGiven the uniform and symmetric nature of steps, after sufficient steps, the distribution tends towards uniform on the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_8^2\\) if the walk is irreducible and aperiodic.\n\n---\n\nStep 5: Determine if the walk is irreducible and aperiodic on \\(\\mathbb{Z}_8^2\\).\n\nThe four moves generate the subgroup of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_8^2\\) generated by \\(\\{(1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)\\}\\).\n\nBut this set is symmetric, and the group generated is the entire \\(\\mathbb{Z}_8^2\\).\n\nHence the random walk is irreducible and aperiodic (since step set generates the entire group), and its distribution converges to the uniform distribution on \\(\\mathbb{Z}_8^2\\).\n\n---\n\nStep 6: Since the walk is symmetric and steps are uniform, the distribution after large number of steps is uniform.\n\nTherefore, the probability that after 2012 steps the random walk is at (0,0) mod 8 is exactly:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8 \\times 8} = \\frac{1}{64}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nStep 7: Verify the parity:\n\nSince each \\(X_i, Y_i\\) is \\(\\pm 1\\), the sums \\(S_x, S_y\\) have parity depending on the number of steps.\n\nSince 2012 is even, the sums \\(S_x, S_y\\) are even integers in \\([-2012,2012]\\). This is consistent with the possible structure modulo 8.\n\nHence the uniform probability conclusion holds.\n\n---\n\n**Final answers:**\n\nProblem 1: The prime triples \\((p,q,r)\\) are:\n- (7, 3, 2)\n- (5, 3, 5)\n- (3, 2, 7Problem 2: Probability = 1/64.\n\n---\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1 involves solving the equation p/q - 4/(r+1) = 1 with p,q,r prime. Rewriting gives p/q = (r+5)/(r+1). Checking primes r, only r=2,5,7 produce fractions reducible to prime numerator and denominator: (7/3), (5/3), and (3/2) respectively. These satisfy the equation. Problem 2 models a random walk on an 8x8 torus with moves equally likely among the four diagonals. The sum of steps mod 8 behaves as a random walk on Z_8 x Z_8, which is irreducible and aperiodic, thus the position becomes uniformly distributed after many steps. Therefore, after 2012 steps, the probability of returning to the origin is 1/(8*8) = 1/64.\",\n  \"answer_1\": \"(7,3,2),(5,3,5),(3,2,7)\",\n  \"answer_2\": \"1/64\"\n}",
