You select two points on the twig independently and uniformly at random, make cuts at these two points, and keep only the largest piece. This process is repeated 2012 times. What is the expected length of the remaining piece after 2012 repetitions?\n\nStep 1: Consider one repetition. The twig has some length \\( L \\). You select two points independently and uniformly at random on this segment.\n\nStep 2: The two points split the segment into three pieces, whose lengths add up to \\( L \\).\n\nStep 3: The two points can be represented by two independent uniform random variables \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) on \\([0, L]\\). WLOG, assume \\( 0 < X < Y < L \\) after sorting.\n\nStep 4: The three segments have lengths \\( X \\), \\( Y - X \\), and \\( L - Y \\).\n\nStep 5: The largest piece length after cuts is the maximum of \\( (X, Y - X, L - Y) \\).\n\nBecause \\( X, Y \\) are uniform on \\([0,L]\\), we can use scale invariance: the distribution of (X/L, Y/L) is uniform on the unit square.\n\nTherefore, the expected largest segment length after the cut of a segment of length 1 is\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[ \\max(X, Y - X, 1 - Y) ]\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( 0 \\leq X, Y \\leq 1 \\) are i.i.d uniform random variables.\n\nStep 6: Due to symmetry, the expected largest segment is proportional to the original length by a factor \\(E\\).\n\nThen after one repetition, the expected length is \\( E \\times L \\).\n\nAfter repeated cuts (2012 times), the expected length is \\( E^{2012} \\times 1 = E^{2012} \\).\n\nStep 7: We find \\( E = \\mathbb{E}[ \\max(X, Y - X, 1 - Y) ] \\) for two independent uniform random variables on \\([0,1]\\).\n\nStep 8: Because \\(X, Y\\) are i.i.d uniform on \\([0,1]\\), the joint pdf is 1 on the unit square.\n\nTo find \\( \\mathbb{E}[\\max(X, Y-X, 1 - Y)] \\), consider the order statistics \\( U = \\min(X,Y) \\), \\( V = \\max(X,Y) \\).\n\nThen \\( U \\sim \\text{Beta}(1,2) \\) on [0,1], \\( V \\sim \\text{Beta}(2,1) \\), and the joint pdf of (U,V) is \\( 2 \\) on the triangle \\( 0 \\leq U \\leq V \\leq 1 \\).\n\nNow,\n\n\\[\n\\max(X, Y - X, 1 - Y) = \\max(U, V - U, 1 - V)\n\\]\n\nbecause when sorting \\(X, Y\\), the three segment lengths are \\(U, V - U, 1 - V\\).\n\nStep 9: The expected maximum is\n\n\\[\nE = \\int_0^1 \\int_u^1 2 \\cdot \\max(u, v - u, 1 - v) \\ dv \\ du\n\\]\n\nStep 10: To integrate, divide the domain into parts where one of the three is the maximum.\n\nWe define:\n\n- \\(A\\): region where \\( u \\) is max\n- \\(B\\): region where \\( v - u \\) is max\n- \\(C\\): region where \\( 1 - v \\) is max\n\nFind the boundaries:\n\n- \\( u \\geq v - u \\Rightarrow 2u \\geq v \\)\n- \\( u \\geq 1 - v \\Rightarrow u + v \\geq 1 \\)\n- \\( v - u \\geq u \\Rightarrow v \\geq 2u \\)\n- \\( v - u \\geq 1 - v \\Rightarrow 2v \\geq 1 + u \\)\n- \\( 1 - v \\geq u \\Rightarrow u + v \\leq 1 \\)\n- \\( 1 - v \\geq v - u \\Rightarrow u \\geq 2v -1 \\)\n\nStep 11: Based on these inequalities and the domain \\( 0 \\leq u \\leq v \\leq 1 \\), set up integrals:\n\n- Region A: \\( u \\geq v-u \\) and \\( u \\geq 1-v \\), so \\( 2u \\geq v \\) and \\( u + v \\geq 1 \\), with \\( 0 \\le u \\le v \\le 1 \\).\n- Region B: \\( v-u \\geq u \\) and \\( v-u \\geq 1-v \\), so \\( v \\geq 2u \\) and \\( 2v \\geq 1 + u \\).\n- Region C: \\( 1 - v \\geq u \\) and \\( 1 - v \\geq v - u \\), so \\( u + v \\leq 1 \\) and \\( u \\geq 2v -1 \\).\n\nWe integrate \\( 2 \\times \\) the max in each region.\n\nStep 12: We'll calculate the integral over each region.\n\nRegion C (simplest): \\( u + v \\leq 1 \\), \\( u \\geq 2v - 1 \\), with \\( 0 \\leq u \\le v \\le 1 \\).\n\nSince \\( u \\leq v \\), for \\( u \\geq 2v -1 \\), note \\( 2v -1 \\leq v \\Rightarrow v \\geq 1 \\), so this is relevant only where \\( v \\) is close to 1.\n\nBut since \\( u + v \\le 1 \\), max value is \\( 1 - v \\).\n\nProceed to calculate integral over each region numerically or symbolically.\n\nHowever, there is a well-known result:\n\n**Known fact:** The expected length of the largest segment formed by two random cuts on a segment of length 1 is \\( \\frac{11}{18} \\).\n\n(Reference: This problem is classical in \"Cutting a stick into 3 parts\" and max segment expectation.)\n\nStep 13: Given that each iteration scales the expected length by \\( \\frac{11}{18} \\), after n iterations, expected length is\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{11}{18}\\right)^n\n\\]\n\nStep 14: For \\( n = 2012 \\), the expected length is\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{11}{18}\\right)^{2012}\n\\]\n\n**Problem 1 Answer:** \\( (11/18)^{2012} \\).\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2**\n\nKevin starts with vectors \\( (1,0) \\) and \\( (0,1) \\). At each time step, he replaces one of the vectors with their sum. After 8 time steps, find the cotangent of the minimum possible angle between the two vectors.\n\nStep 1: Let the vectors after the steps be \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\).\n\nWe start with \\( v_1 = (1,0) \\), \\( v_2 = (0,1) \\).\n\nStep 2: At each step, replace either \\( v_1 \\leftarrow v_1 + v_2 \\) or \\( v_2 \\leftarrow v_1 + v_2 \\).\n\nStep 3: After 8 steps, the vectors are linear integer combinations of the original basis vectors with coefficients following a path of adding one vector to another.\n\nStep 4: This process corresponds exactly to generating pairs of Fibonacci-type vectors.\n\nIn fact, if at step \\( k \\) the vectors are \\( (a_k, b_k) \\) and \\( (c_k, d_k) \\), the operations build linear combinations.\n\nStep 5: To minimize the angle between vectors, we want vectors close in direction.\n\nStep 6: Each replacement increases both vectors. The vectors after n steps are:\n\n\\[\nv_1 = (F_{k+1}, F_k), \\quad v_2 = (F_k, F_{k-1})\n\\]\n\nor some variation thereof, where \\( F_n \\) are Fibonacci numbers.\n\nStep 7: Indeed, starting from (1,0) and (0,1), repeated replacements create vectors whose coordinates are Fibonacci numbers.\n\nStep 8: The minimal angle between the vectors after n steps corresponds to the angle between two consecutive Fibonacci vectors, which are close to each other in direction, because the ratio approximates the golden ratio.\n\nStep 9: The cosine of the angle \\( \\theta \\) between \\( v_1 = (F_{k+1}, F_k) \\) and \\( v_2 = (F_k, F_{k-1}) \\) is\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{v_1 \\cdot v_2}{|v_1||v_2|} = \\frac{F_{k+1}F_k + F_k F_{k-1}}{\\sqrt{F_{k+1}^2 + F_k^2} \\sqrt{F_k^2 + F_{k-1}^2}}\n\\]\n\nStep 10: The cotangent can be found from\n\n\\[\n\\cot \\theta = \\frac{\\cos \\theta}{\\sin \\theta} = \\frac{v_1 \\cdot v_2}{|v_1 \\times v_2|}\n\\]\n\nBecause in 2D, the cross product magnitude is\n\n\\[\n|v_1 \\times v_2| = |F_{k+1}F_{k-1} - F_k^2|\n\\]\n\nStep 11: Use the identity \\( F_{k+1} F_{k-1} - F_k^2 = (-1)^k \\), known Cassini's identity.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n|v_1 \\times v_2| = 1\n\\]\n\nStep 12: The dot product is\n\n\\[\nv_1 \\cdot v_2 = F_{k+1} F_k + F_k F_{k-1} = F_k (F_{k+1} + F_{k-1})\n\\]\n\nBut \\( F_{k+1} = F_k + F_{k-1} \\), so\n\n\\[\nF_{k+1} + F_{k-1} = (F_k + F_{k-1}) + F_{k-1} = F_k + 2 F_{k-1}\n\\]\n\nTherefore\n\n\\[\nv_1 \\cdot v_2 = F_k (F_k + 2 F_{k-1}) = F_k^2 + 2 F_k F_{k-1}\n\\]\n\nStep 13: Hence,\n\n\\[\n\\cot \\theta = \\frac{v_1 \\cdot v_2}{|v_1 \\times v_2|} = F_k^2 + 2 F_k F_{k-1}\n\\]\n\nStep 14: We want to find \\( k \\) such that after 8 steps, we get these vectors.\n\nSince each step increases the Fibonacci index by 1 in one vector, total steps equals sum of indices increases.\n\nStep 15: The number of steps corresponds to \\( k = 4 \\) because each replacement increases sum of Fibonacci indices by 1, starting from indices (1,0) and (0,1) for the vectors.\n\nAfter \\( n \\) steps, the sum of Fibonacci index is \\( n \\).\n\nTherefore, after 8 steps, set \\( k = 4 \\).\n\nStep 16: Fibonacci numbers:\n\n\\( F_3 = 2 \\), \\( F_4 = 3 \\), \\( F_5 = 5 \\).\n\nCheck:\n\n\\[\n\\cot \\theta = F_4^2 + 2 F_4 F_3 = 3^2 + 2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 9 + 12 = 21\n\\]\n\nStep 17: Thus the cotangent of the minimal angle after 8 steps is 21.\n\n---\n\nNow gather everything in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Problem 1: We consider the expected length reduction when cutting a twig of length 1 by two independent uniform points and retaining the longest piece.
