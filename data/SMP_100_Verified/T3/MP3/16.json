  "Math_Problem": "Find the number of subsets $S$ of $\\{1,2, \\ldots 6\\}$ satisfying the following conditions: - $S$ is non-empty. - No subset of $S$ has the property that the sum of its elements is 10. Instead of finding the total number of such subsets, simply find $k = N_5 - 8$, where $N_5$ is the number of non-empty subsets whose largest element is 5 and that satisfy the given condition. Find the number of ordered triples of nonnegative integers $(a, b, c)$ that satisfy $(ab+k)(bc+k)(ca+k)=84$. Instead of determining the number of ordered triples of nonnegative integers satisfying the given multiplicative condition, simply find $m$, where $m$ is the smallest positive integer that appears as a component value in any of those triples. At a certain chocolate company, each bar is 1 unit long. To make the bars more interesting, the company has decided to combine dark and white chocolate pieces. The process starts with two bars, one completely dark and one completely white. At each step of the process, a new number $p$ is chosen uniformly at random between 0 and 1. Each of the two bars is cut $p$ units from the left, and the pieces on the left are switched: each is grafted onto the opposite bar where the other piece of length $p$ was previously attached. For example, the bars might look like this after the first step: Each step after the first operates on the bars resulting from the previous step. After a total of 100 steps, what is the probability that on each bar, the chocolate $\\left(m - \\frac{2}{3}\\right)$ units from the left is the same type of chocolate as that $\\frac{2}{3}$ units from the left?",

The process starts with two bars, one completely dark and one completely white. At each step of the process, a new number $p$ is chosen uniformly at random between 0 and 1. Each of the two bars is cut $p$ units from the left, and the pieces on the left are switched: each is grafted onto the opposite bar where the other piece of length $p$ was previously attached. For example, the bars might look like this after the first step: Each step after the first operates on the bars resulting from the previous step. After a total of 100 steps, what is the probability that on each bar, the chocolate $1 / 3$ units from the left is the same type of chocolate as that $2 / 3$ units from the left?"
