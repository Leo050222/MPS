  "Math_Problem": "The game of Penta is played with teams of five players each, and there are five roles the players can play. Each of the five players chooses two of five roles they wish to play. If each player chooses their roles randomly, what is the probability that each role will have exactly two players? Instead of computing the probability that every role is selected by precisely two players, simply find T(favorable), the total number of favorable outcomes where each role receives exactly two choices. Given a positive integer $k$, let $\\|k\\|$ denote the absolute difference between $k$ and the nearest perfect square. For example, $\\|13\\|=3$ since the nearest perfect square to 13 is 16. Compute the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{\\|1\\|+\\|2\\|+\\cdots+\\|n\\|}{n}=(T(favorable)-1940)$. Instead of computing the smallest positive integer $n$ such that the average of the $\\Vert k\\Vert$ for $k=1$ to $n$ equals 100, simply find $d = k - 198$, where $k$ is the largest integer such that the average of the $\\Vert j\\Vert$ over the $k$ consecutive positive integers immediately preceding the perfect square succeeding the largest such $n$ equals 100. Two players play a game where they are each given 10 indistinguishable units that must be distributed across three locations. (Units cannot be split.) At each location, a player wins at that location if the number of units they placed there is at least 2 more than the units of the other player. If both players distribute their units randomly (i.e. there is an equal probability of them distributing their units for any attainable distribution across the 3 locations), the probability that at least one location is won by one of the players can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are positive integers with $\\gcd(a, b) = d$. Compute $100a + b$.",
