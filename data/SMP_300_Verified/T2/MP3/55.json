  "Math_Problem": "A rubber band is 4 inches long. An ant begins at the left end. Every minute, the ant walks one inch along rightwards along the rubber band, but then the band is stretched (uniformly) by one inch. For what value of $n$ will the ant reach the right end during the $n$th minute? Instead of determining the minute during which the ant reaches the right end, simply find $p$, where $p$ is the portion of the rubber band's length traversed by the ant during the first minute accounting for the uniform stretch. Let $s = p + \\frac{23}{4}$. $s$ students taking a test sit in a row of seats with aisles only on the two sides of the row. If they finish the test at random times, what is the probability that some student will have to pass by another student to get to an aisle? Instead of determining the probability that at least one student must pass by another to reach an aisle, simply find $p$, where $p$ is the probability that no student has to pass by another, derived from the sequential condition that each departing student occupies an end position of the remaining row. Let $n = p + \\frac{313}{45}$ lattice points form a convex $n$-gon with all sides having distinct lengths. Find the minimum possible value of the sum of the squares of the sides of the $n$-gon.",
