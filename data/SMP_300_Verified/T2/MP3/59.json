  "Math_Problem": "Compute the radius of the inscribed circle of a triangle with sides 15, 16, and 17. Instead of computing the inradius of the triangle, simply find $s$, the semi-perimeter of the triangle. What is the smallest positive integer $x$ for which $x^{2}+x+(s + 17)$ is not a prime? Instead of identifying the minimal positive integer input for which the quadratic yields a non-prime, simply find $k$, which is that yielded value minus 1680. In preparation for a game of Fish, Carl must deal 48 cards to 6 players. For each card that he deals, he runs through the entirety of the following process: 1. He gives a card to a random player. 2. A player Z is randomly chosen from the set of players who have at least as many cards as every other player (i.e. Z has the most cards or is tied for having the most cards). 3. A player D is randomly chosen from the set of players other than Z who have at most as many cards as every other player (i.e. D has the fewest cards or is tied for having the fewest cards). 4. Z gives one card to D. He repeats steps 1-4 for each card dealt, including the last card. The players are labeled 1 through 6. After all the cards have been dealt, what is the probability that each player $i$ has exactly 8 cards for every $i$ from $k$ to 6?",
