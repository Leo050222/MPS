After an even number of minutes, the position always has an even number of 1's. In terms of $k$, for $k>0$ how likely is he to be back where he started after $2 k$ minutes? Instead of determining the return probability as a function of $k$, simply find $m = q_0 + 9/4$, where $q_0$ is the initial deviation of the return probability from its limiting value derived from the recurrence relation for returns to the origin.
