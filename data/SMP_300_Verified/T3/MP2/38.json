  "Math_Problem": "Roger initially has 20 socks in a drawer, each of which is either white or black. He chooses a sock uniformly at random from the drawer and throws it away. He repeats this action until there are equal numbers of white and black socks remaining. Suppose that the probability he stops before all socks are gone is $p$. If the sum of all distinct possible values of $p$ over all initial combinations of socks is $\\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$. Instead of computing the sum of all distinct possible values of the stopping probability over all initial combinations of socks, simply find $p_{10}$, the stopping probability when the drawer initially contains an equal number of white and black socks. There are $p_{10} + \\frac{38324}{19}$ frogs in a pool and there is 1 frog on the shore. In each time-step thereafter, one random frog moves position. If it was in the pool, it jumps to the shore, and vice versa. Find the expected number of time-steps before all frogs are in the pool for the first time.",
