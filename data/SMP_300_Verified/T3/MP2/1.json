(A lattice point is a point whose Cartesian coordinates are both integers. A hexagon may be concave but not self-intersecting.) Instead of counting the total number of such hexagons, simply find $k = H - 6$, where $H$ is the number of valid hexagons with the fourth vertex at a lattice point whose coordinates have absolute values $2$ and $3$, derived from analysis of possible vertex positions at the required distance. Let $S$ be the set of all 3-digit numbers with all digits in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$ (so in particular, all three digits are nonzero). For how many elements $\\overline{a b c}$ of $S$ is it true that at least one of the (not necessarily distinct) 'digit cycles' $\\overline{a b c}$, $\\overline{b c a}$, $\\overline{c a b}$ is congruent to $k$ modulo $7$?
