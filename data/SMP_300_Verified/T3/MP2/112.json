Instead of finding all positive integer pairs that make the given expression prime, simply find $m$, the prime number equal to that expression. Manya has a stack of $85=1+4+16+64$ blocks comprised of 4 layers (the $k$ th layer from the top has $4^{k-1}$ blocks). Each block rests on 4 smaller blocks, each with dimensions half those of the larger block. Laura removes blocks one at a time from this stack, removing only blocks that currently have no blocks on top of them. Find the number of ways Laura can remove precisely $m$ blocks from Manya's stack (the order in which they are removed matters).",
