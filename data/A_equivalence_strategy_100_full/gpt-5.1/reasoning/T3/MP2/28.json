Determine, with proof, whether there exists a strictly increasing eight-term arithmetic progression $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{8}$ of odd positive integers such that $r\\left(a_{1}\\right), \\ldots, r\\left(a_{8}\\right)$ is an arithmetic progression in that order. Instead of determining whether such a progression exists, simply find $\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is the binary digit in the third of three consecutive terms with equal binary length at the minimal bit position $j \\geq 1$ where the binary representations of the first and second of those terms differ, derived from the arithmetic progression relation among the original terms.
