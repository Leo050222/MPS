What would the same MP3 player sell for if it was on sale for $30 \\%$ off of its original price? Instead of computing the sale price under the alternative discount percentage, simply find $k = R - 128$, where $R$ is the original price of the MP3 player determined from the given sale price after the initial discount. For some integers $m$ and $n$, the expression $(x+m)(x+n)$ is equal to a quadratic expression in $x$ with a constant term of $-k$. Which of the following cannot be a value of $m$?",
