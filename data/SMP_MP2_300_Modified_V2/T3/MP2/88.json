  "Math_Problem": "In the game of Galactic Dominion, players compete to amass cards, each of which is worth a certain number of points. Say you are playing a version of this game with only two kinds of cards, planet cards and hegemon cards. Each planet card is worth 2010 points, and each hegemon card is worth four points per planet card held. You start with no planet cards and no hegemon cards, and, on each turn, starting at turn one, you take either a planet card or a hegemon card, whichever is worth more points given the hand you currently hold. Define a sequence \\(\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}\\) for all positive integers \\(n\\) by setting \\(a_{n}\\) to be 0 if on turn \\(n\\) you take a planet card and 1 if you take a hegemon card. What is the smallest value of \\(N\\) such that the sequence \\(a_{N}, a_{N+1}, \\ldots\\) is necessarily periodic (meaning that there is a positive integer \\(k\\) such that \\(a_{n+k}=a_{n}\\) for all \\(n \\geq N\\)) ? Instead of determining the minimal index from which the tail of the sequence is periodic, simply find \\(k = a_{502} + 9\\), where \\(a_{502}\\) is the term of the sequence at position 502 derived from the game's decision rules. Two positive rational numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), when written in lowest terms, have the property that the sum of their numerators is \\(k\\) and the sum of their denominators is \\(k + 1\\). What is the largest possible value of \\(x+y\\)?",
