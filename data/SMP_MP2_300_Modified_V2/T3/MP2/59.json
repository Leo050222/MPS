  "Math_Problem": "Jude repeatedly flips a coin. If he has already flipped $n$ heads, the coin lands heads with probability $\\frac{1}{n+2}$ and tails with probability $\\frac{n+1}{n+2}$. If Jude continues flipping forever, let $p$ be the probability that he flips 3 heads in a row at some point. Compute $\\lfloor 180 p \\rfloor$. Instead of computing the floor of 180 times the probability of eventually flipping three heads in a row, simply find $\\delta = p_5 - \\frac{53}{72}$, where $p_5$ is the probability that the fifth head is preceded by a tail and that no three consecutive heads have occurred in the sequence up to the fifth head, as derived from analyzing the process to avoid three consecutive heads. Compute the number of ways a non-self-intersecting concave quadrilateral can be drawn in the plane such that two of its vertices are $(\\delta, \\delta)$ and $(1, \\delta)$, and the other two vertices are two distinct lattice points $(a, b),(c, d)$ with $\\delta \\leq a, c \\leq (\\delta + 59)$ and $(\\delta + 1) \\leq b, d \\leq (\\delta + 5)$.",
