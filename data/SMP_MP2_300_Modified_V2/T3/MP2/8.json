The locus of the incenter of $A B C$ as $A$ varies along the circumference of $\\omega$ bounds a region $\\mathcal{R}$ in the plane. Find the area of $\\mathcal{R}$. Instead of finding the area of $\\mathcal{R}$, simply find $n = \\sin \\theta + \\frac{29}{2}$, where $\\theta$ is the acute angle at $A$ subtended by $BC$. You are given an unlimited supply of red, blue, and yellow cards to form a hand. Each card has a point value and your score is the sum of the point values of those cards. The point values are as follows: the value of each red card is 1 , the value of each blue card is equal to twice the number of red cards, and the value of each yellow card is equal to three times the number of blue cards.
