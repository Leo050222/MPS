Instead of determining the probability of exactly two open doors among the four, simply find $Pr$, where $Pr$ is the probability that exactly two of the four doors are open derived from counting the favorable configurations among all possible states of the doors. The line with equation $y=2x-(Pr + 45/8)$ is translated upwards by 4 units. What is the $x$-intercept of the resulting line?",
