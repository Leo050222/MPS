  "Math_Problem": "Now a ball is launched from a vertex of an equilateral triangle with side length 5. It strikes the opposite side after traveling a distance of $\\sqrt{19}$. Find the distance from the ball's point of first contact with a wall to the nearest vertex. Instead of finding the distance from the point of first contact to the nearest vertex, simply find $k = d + 199/2$, where $d$ is the distance from the foot of the perpendicular from the launch vertex to the opposite side to the point of first contact. Eric is taking a biology class. His problem sets are worth 100 points in total, his three midterms are worth 100 points each, and his final is worth 300 points. If he gets a perfect score on his problem sets and scores $(k - 40) \\%$, $(k - 30) \\%$, and $(k - 20) \\%$ on his midterms respectively, what is the minimum possible percentage $p$ he can get on his final to ensure a passing grade? (Eric passes if and only if his overall percentage is at least $(k - 30) \\%)$.",
