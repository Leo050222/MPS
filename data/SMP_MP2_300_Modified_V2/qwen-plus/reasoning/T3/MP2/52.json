  "Math_Problem": "The country of HMMTLand has 8 cities. Its government decides to construct several two-way roads between pairs of distinct cities. After they finish construction, it turns out that each city can reach exactly 3 other cities via a single road, and from any pair of distinct cities, either exactly 0 or 2 other cities can be reached from both cities by a single road. Compute the number of ways HMMTLand could have constructed the roads. Instead of computing the total number of possible road constructions satisfying the conditions, simply find $N$, where $N$ is the number of connected road constructions satisfying the conditions. A real number $x$ is chosen uniformly at random from the interval $(0,10)$. Compute the probability that $\\sqrt{x}$, $\\sqrt{x+(N-833)}$, and $\\sqrt{10-x}$ are the side lengths of a non-degenerate triangle.",
