  "Math_Problem": "A fat coin is one which, when tossed, has a $2 / 5$ probability of being heads, $2 / 5$ of being tails, and $1 / 5$ of landing on its edge. Mr. Fat starts at 0 on the real line. Every minute, he tosses a fat coin. If it's heads, he moves left, decreasing his coordinate by 1; if it's tails, he moves right, increasing his coordinate by 1. If the coin lands on its edge, he moves back to 0. If Mr. Fat does this ad infinitum, what fraction of his time will he spend at 0? Instead of finding the long-run proportion of time spent at the origin, simply find $r$, where $r$ is the factor less than 1 by which the stationary probability at distance $n$ from 0 relates to that at distance $n+1$, derived from the balance equations for the long-run proportions at non-zero positions. Let $Z$ be as in problem 15. Let $X$ be the greatest integer such that $|X Z| \\leq r + \\frac{9}{2}$. Find $X$.",
