  "Math_Problem": "A group of friends are sharing a bag of candy. On the first day, they eat $\\x0crac{1}{2}$ of the candies in the bag. On the second day, they eat $\\x0crac{2}{3}$ of the remaining candies. On the third day, they eat $\\x0crac{3}{4}$ of the remaining candies. On the fourth day, they eat $\\x0crac{4}{5}$ of the remaining candies. On the fifth day, they eat $\\x0crac{5}{6}$ of the remaining candies. At the end of the fifth day, there is 1 candy remaining in the bag. How many candies were in the bag before the first day? Instead of determining the initial number of candies in the bag, simply find $k = r - 269$, where $r$ is the number of candies remaining after the first day derived from the consumption on the first day. A sequence of figures is formed using tiles. Each tile is an equilateral triangle with side length 7 cm. The first figure consists of 1 tile. Each figure after the first is formed by adding 1 tile to the previous figure. How many tiles are used to form the figure in the sequence with perimeter $k$ cm?",
