For each positive integer $n$ , find all real solutions of the equation $ f_n(x) = 2x $ . Instead of finding all real solutions of the equation $f_n(x) = 2x$ for each positive integer $n$, simply find $k$, where $k$ is the constant satisfying $f_1(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 6k}$ derived from the given definition. One day, there is a Street Art Show at somewhere, and there are some spectators around. We consider this place as an Euclidean plane. Let $K$ be the center of the show. And name the spectators by $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}, \\ldots$ They pick their positions $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}, \\ldots$ one by one. The positions need to satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously. (i) The distance between $K$ and $A_{n}$ is no less than 10 meters, that is, $K P_{n} \\geq 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any positive integer $n$. (ii) The distance between $A_{n}$ and any previous spectator is no less than $(k - 7)$ meters, that is, $P_{m} P_{n} \\geq (k - 7) \\mathrm{~m}$ holds for any $n \\geq 2$ and any $1 \\leq m \\leq n-1$. (iii) $A_{n}$ always choose the position closest to $K$ that satisfies (i) and (ii), that is, $K P_{n}$ reaches its minimum possible value. If there are more than one point that satisfy (i) and (ii) and have the minimum distance to $K, A_{n}$ may choose any one of them.

For $A_{2}$, since there are lots of points on $C$ which are at least $(k - 7)$ meters apart from $P_{1}$, he may choose anyone of them. (1) Which of the following statement is true?
