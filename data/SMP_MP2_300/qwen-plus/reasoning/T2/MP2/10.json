  "Math_Problem": "You are given a $10 \\times 2$ grid of unit squares. Two different squares are adjacent if they share a side. How many ways can one mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent? Instead of counting the total number of ways to mark exactly nine of the squares so that no two marked squares are adjacent, simply find $w$, where $w$ is the number of ways to mark one square in each of nine consecutive rows such that no two marked squares in adjacent rows share the same column. Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are positive integers with $m<n$ such that the interval $[m, n)$ contains more multiples of $(w + 2019)$ than multiples of 2000. Compute the maximum possible value of $n-m$.",
